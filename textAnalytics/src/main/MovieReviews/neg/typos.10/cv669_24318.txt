ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film
; i have a problem even regarding it as a film
. it
' s more ofthe a show
, a big commercial for ted turner
' s world championship wrestling
( wcw
)
. the movei is almost entirely about
and fully showcases thge wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page
, goldberg
,
and sting
. the stry isnt very minimal
and basic
. htere are these two guys
, gordy
( david arquette
)
and sean
( scott caan
)
. they are two twenty
- something wrestling fans from wyoming
. when they go to a live event for the big match uv
, there favorite wrestler jimmy king
( oliver platt
) is defeated
and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus
( joe pantoliano
)
. gordy
and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy
and bring him back to the top
and defeat the evil titus
' plans
. on the way
, they meet soem people
, have some fun
,
and clean uv some port
- o
- potties
. sounds graet huh
, well it
' s not
. teh movei makes many attempts at humor
, only a few ofthe them work
. thge jokes that make ytou laugh
,
however
, do nto outnumber the film
' s many duds
. there is a funny repertoire between arquette anbd a convenience store cashier palyed by ahmet zappa
. the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways tothe get him back
. i especially enjoyed one version in whitch they have a wrestling match
and arquette
' s tag team partner is
' macho man
' r
andy savage
. they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans
and getting body slammed on the floor
. the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette
and rose mcgowan
. mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl
, tjhe cheerleaders of the wcw
. she becomes attracted to gordy
and they have some nice
, funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan
' s breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face
. now what didn
' t work in this movie
? that would be teh rest of it
. the flick was filled with stupid potty humor baout farts
and toilets
. the two lead characters work for a port
- o
- potty cleaning comany
and when they kresh the truck
, the excrements spill all over the road
. it
' s nto funny
; it
' s pathetic
and brainless
. the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers
but not all wrestling fans are that way
. i watch it for entertainment
and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie
. the main characters in tghe film actually get to wrestle
, like that would happen tothe any fan
, especially tothe 2 that stalk a wrestler
and sneak him back onto set
. also
, i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily
; htey just walked right in
. i liuke wrestling
. i watch it at home
and laugh
. it
' s continuously funny
and has great characters otherwise i wouldn
' t watch it
. this movie wasn
' t even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv
. the only fun i hadnt in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew
. the funny thing wass that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn anbd chris benoit have left wcw for more money
but are still featured in the film prominently
. the movie wass too dim
- witted tothe be funny
. it is possably thte most useless
and under
- developed film ever
. a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film
, detroit rock city
. that movie was interesting
, well done
and continuously funny unlike this film
. the acting was good plus the jokes had humor
and made yuo laugh
. now that the scream trilogy isnt over
, arquette has nothing else tothe do so he has to do crap liuke this
and be a spokesman in those dumb 1
- 800
- call
- att ads
. at least he has a hot wife inspite courtney cox
. he
' s in the funny parts of the film
but there aren
' t enough to mkea him look good
. the music was bad alsot feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock
' s
" bawitdaba
"
and
" cowboy
"
. martin l
andau has a great cameo as a classic
, hard
- nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne
. script is important to a film
but this peice of crap could ahve been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin
. a fan of hte wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it
. at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real
. the wrestlers form alliances
, go to people
' s houses
and beat them up
. it
' s utterly ridiculous
. yhe hwole film was a wasteful
, dumfounding experience
. the movie was made to pay homage tothe the fans
, telling them things that made wrestling
, nto the wrestlers
. the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty
- humor movei
. the wcw sucks anbd this movei isnt just a pathetic two
- hour commercial to watch it
. if you
' re going to watch wrestling watch wwf
, it
' s actually entertaining
. the wrestling is betters
, htey
' re funnier
, more diverse
,
and have better entrance themes
. oh
and the girls are hotter
. is this what movies hve become
, 2 hour
- long commercials that yuo have to pay tothe see
? don
' t waste your money
.
