ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film
; i have a probelm even regarding it as a film
. it ' s more of a show
, a big commercial for ted turner ' s world championship wrestling
( wcw
)
. the movie is almost entirely about
and fully showcases the wrestlers ofthe the wcw like diamond dallas page
, goldberg
,
and sting
. the story is very minimal
and basic
. there are these two guys
, gordy
( david arquette
)
and sean
( scott caan
)
. they are two twenty
- something wrestling fans from wyoming
. when they go to a live event for the big match up
, there favorite wrestler jimmy king
( oliver platt
) is defeated
and his career is annouced to be over by the mean commissioner titus
( joe pantoliano
)
. gordy
and sean decide to go on a quest to fidn jimmy
and bring him back to the top
and defeat the evil titus ' plans
. on the way
, they meet some people
, have some fun
,
and clean uv some port
- o
- potties
. sounds great huh
, well it ' s not
. the movie makse many attempts at humor
, only a few of them work
. the jokes that make you laugh
,
however
, do not outnumber the film ' s many duds
. ther isnt a funny repertoire between arquette
and a convenience store cashier palyed by ahmet zappa
. the cashier is vyre mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back
. i especially enjoied one version in whlch they have a wrestling match
adn arquette ' s tag team partner is ' macho man ' randy savage
. htey wrestle beween the aisles knocking over cans
and getting body slammed on the floor
. the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette
adn rose mcgowan
. mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl
, the cheerleaders of tghe wcw
. she becomes attracted to gordy
and tehy have some nice
, funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan ' s breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face
. now what didn ' t work in this movie
? that would be the rest of it
. the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts
and toilets
. the two lead characters work for a port
- o
- potty cleaning company
and when they crash the truck
, the excrements spill all over the road
. it ' s not funny
; it ' s pathetic
and brainless
. the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of thier wrestlers
but not all wrestling fans are that way
. i watch it for enteratinment
and i would think some people woudl take offense to what is said throughout the movie
. the main characters in the film actually git to wrestle
, liuke that would happen to any fan
, especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler
and sneak him back onto set
. also
, i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily
; they just walked right in
. i like wrestling
. i watch it at home
and laugh
. it ' s continuously funny
anbd has great characters otherwise i wouldn ' t watch it
. this movie wasn ' t even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv
. the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew
. the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn
and chris benoit have left wcw for more money
but are still featured in the film prominently
. the movie was too dim
- witted to be funny
. it is possibly the most useless
and under
- developed film ever
. a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film
, detroit rock city
. that movie was interesting
, well done
and continuously funny unlike this film
. the acting was good plus the jokes had humor
and made you laugh
. now that the scream trilogy is over
, arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this
and be a spokesman in those dumb 1
- 800
- call
- att ads
. at least he has a hot wife inwhich courtney cox
. he ' s in the funny parts ofthe the film
but there aren ' t enough tothe make him look good
. the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock ' s
" bawitdaba
"
and
" cowboy
"
. martin landau has a great cameo as a classic
, hard
- nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne
. script is importan to a film
but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin
. a fan of the wrestlers who are featured inthe thte film probably wrote it
. at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real
. the wrestlers form alliances
, go to people ' s houses
anbd beat them up
. it ' s utterly ridiculous
. the whole film was a wasteful
, dumfounding experience
. the movie was made to pay homage to the fans
, telling them things thta made wrestling
, not the wrestlers
. yhe wrestlers are making more money to make a movie tothe thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty
- humor movie
. the wcw sucks
and this movie isnt just a pathetic two
- hour commercial to watch it
. if you ' re going to watch wrestling watch wwf
, it ' s actually entertaining
. the wrestling is betters
, they ' re funnier
, more diverse
,
and have better entrance themes
. oh
annd the girls are hotter
. is this what movies have become
, 2 hour
- long commercials that you have to pay to see
? don ' t waste your money
.
