" you damn dirty apes
!
" that
' s just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of hte apes that
' s taken on a comedic context over time
. no one back thne seemed to realize how over
- the
- top charlton heston
' s acting style was
,
but it shows now
, particularily in this
" mystery cience theater 3000
" wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time
, atcually winning one oscar
( for makeup
, no less
)
and being nominated for a couple others
. it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath hte planet of the apes
, escape from the planet of the apes
, return of the planet of the apes
, beneath the escape from the return of the planet of tje apes
, planet of the apes
: the next generation
, police academy of the apes
.
.
. hte list goes on
. heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thous
and light years in space with his three companions
and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth
. the thing is
, on this planet humans can
' t talk or think
and the guys in the gerilla masks are yhe dominant species
. heston
' s companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned
. he surprises them all with his gift of speech
, making twpo primate scientists
( roddy mcdowall
and kim hunter
) believe heston is the missing link between ape
and man
. believe me
, we movie critics have been thinking the smae thing for years
. when the two apes present teh idea before a judicial counsel
( the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans
)
, it is received as heresy
, for all good monkeys know god
" created ape in his image
.
"
but heston hasnt already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species
, before apes ever gained tjhe ability to speak
and run for president
.
and he takes them there
, holding up a baby doll anbd yelling
,
" if humans couldn
' t speak
,
then how do you account for this talking doll
?
!
"
and how dont you account for your acting ability
, mr
. heston
? the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie
' s suprize conclusion
. i won
' t reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach
and yelling
" god damn you all to hell
!
" several times in succession
. the movie is atrocious
and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies
and laugh at them
. what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony
, a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution
.
but let me tell you
, if darwin could see the ape masks
and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges
( heston
[ to female ape
]
: may i kiss you before i go
? ape
:
but
.
.
. yuo
' re so
.
.
. ugly
.
)
, he
' d convert to creationism on teh spot
. luckily for us
, sicence
- fiction movies have evolved over time tothe the point at whlch some of them are actually ogod
.
