" you damn dirty apes
!
" that ' s just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes tath ' s taken on a comedic context over time
. no noe back
then seemed to realize how over
- the
- top charlton heston ' s acting style was
,
but it shows now
, particularly in this
" mystery science theater 3000
" wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time
, catually winning one oscar
( for makeup
, no less
)
annd being nominated for a couple others
. it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes
, escape from the planet of thte apes
, return of the planet of the apes
, beneath teh excape from the return of the planet of the apes
, planet ofthe the apes
: the next generation
, police academy of tyhe apes
.
.
. the list goes on
. heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions
and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth
. the thing is
, on this planet humans can ' t talk or think
and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species
. heston ' s companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned
. he surprises them all with his gift of sprech
, making two primate scientists
( roddy mcdowall
and kim hunter
) believe heston is tghe missing link between ape
and man
. believe me
, we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years
. when the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel
( the head ape being shakespearean actro maurice evans
)
, it is received as heresy
, fo all good monkeys know god
" created ape in his image
.
"
but heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant speices
, before apes ever gained the ability to speak
and run for president
.
and he takes them there
, holding up a baby doll
and yelling
,
" if humans couldn ' t speak
,
then how dont you account for this talking doll
?
!
"
adn how do you account for your acting ability
, mr
. heston
? the absolute most laughable scene comes withthe the movie ' s surprise conclusion
. i won ' t reveal tghe details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach
and yelling
" god damn you all to hell
!
" several times in succession
. the movie isnt atrocious
and should only be viewed by those munbers of society who like to watch bad movies
and laugh at them
. what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to fucntion as some sort of social irony
, a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution
.
but let me tell you
, if darwin could see the ape masks
and hear hte rotten dialogue exchanges
( heston
[ to female ape
]
: may i kiss you before i go
? ape
:
but
.
.
. you ' re so
.
.
. ugly
.
)
, he ' d convert to creationism on the spot
. luckily for us
, science
- fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good
.
