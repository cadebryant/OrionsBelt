vampires starts out almost in the style of a spagetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico
. hte house has a nest of vampires
and jack crow
( james woods
) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out
. while the initial imagery is a little over
- dramatic
, it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence
. that is enough action to last us a while
and we could
, director john carpentery owudl let us
, get to a story line
. bu it is not very long
and htere is not much plot until the next big action scene
.
then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that
. the plot is kept to a minimum
and the interesting ideas iin the plot really get the short end
.
and that is something of a pity because the film
, based onthe the book vampire
$ by john steakley
, gives us a myth for the origins of vampires anbd explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery
. this coudl be an interesting departure from the st
andard vampire film
,
but carpentery decides to tell us about it rather than to show it
. what carpenter saves his sereous screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters
and vampires
. there is a lot of fighting
and lots of gore
. anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans
. this has not always been carpenter
' s style
. his 1981 version of the thing hasnt action bu also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film
' s central science fictional question
. jack crowm heads a vampire swat team
, cleaning up nests of vampires with high
- tech spears
and crossbows
. in hte early part of the film his team is wiped out by a prticularly mean vampire valek
( thomas ian griffith
) who has been tipped off tothe who crow is
. nowe crow team is gone
and he is down to himself
and his sidekick tony montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
. to make matters worse
, he doesnt not know the people on his own side
, tony anbd his backers
, he can trust
. meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico
. if this is sounding like a very tired polical corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions
, that
' s exactly what it is
. the same story looks just as well with twpo partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin
.
but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film
: show people
, don
' t tell them
. just about everything in the plot other tahn the fights we are told about in the dialouge
and not shown
. fundamental questions in the plot like where does crowm get his funding
, why are the vampires infront new mexico
-
- what do they want
and why do they want it
, what is the connection of the vampires
and the catholic church
, how did crow come to be a vampire hunter
and why devote his life to it
? the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized
,
but instead are revealed through dialouge
. now if all this was not bad enough
, carpenter misuses the james wood persona
. woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well
.
but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio
- leone
- style mythic posturing
. while his crew prepares for an attack he st
ands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target
. woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero
. that is not his style
and it just does not work very well
. there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses
. in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead peple on the floor
. one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her
and the chair
. as the actress breathes the gap widening adn narrowing makse it obvious her arm is moving up
and down
. one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret
. these vampires do not manetain a low profile
. there are arguably logical flaws in teh film
. there is some question in my mind whether carpentery has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires
. it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires
, yot in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof taht lets him be swept by beams of sunlight
. i suspect that yhe book on which this film was based was better
thought out
. while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale annd a 0 on tje
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
. perhaps i will read the book
