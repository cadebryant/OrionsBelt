( named hansel
) loves the american music

, he gets the opprotunity to meet
and marry an american g
. i
.
,
but first
, he must get a sex change
( enter hedwig
)
. once married
, the two move to the states
,
but quickly thereafter
, git a divorce
. at that point
, hedwig starts writing music
and meets another confused boy
, who soon turns into a star
. that boy also turns his back on hedwig
,
and it isn
' t long before hedwig puts together his
/ her pwn b
and
and tours the states via seafood restaurants
. this is thte story of his
/ her life
, told via flashbacks
and musical numbers
. critique
: an artsy
- fartsy musical with great songs
and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell
, doesn
' t realyl come together as a whole
, with over
- thte
- top symbolism
, incoherence
and too much pretension to retain my interst all the whole way through
. in fact
, htis isn
' t so much of a realistic
, articulate
, behind
- the
- scenes look at the rise of a rock
' n roll star
, as it is an ambiguous
, overly poetic
and incomprehensible struggle of a man
, his sexuality
and his identity as a whole person on this planet
. i guess that i was expecting the fromer going in
. the film is somewhat interesting to a point
, bu i was personally never able to involve myself too much
, as tyhe basic symbolic
and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold
and distant
. bu it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience
. chances are that if you are a fan of the wall
, the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla
, queen ofthe the desert
, the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy
( some of the cahracters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point
,
and provide the lyrics of their song
, onthe
- screen
)
. well
, i personally don
' t care fo those films
,
and didn
' t really git into the whole
" show
" atmosphere of this movie either
. i guess i might
' ve looked at it all too literally
,
but like i said earlier
, i just didn
' t care enough about tjhe characters to delve into the
" so the
butterfly represents his freedom
?
" side of thigns
. all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered
and didn
' t amke me efel any more fulfilled
. what was hedwig
' s relationship with that otehr member of his b
and
( with the beard
)
? whta happened with hedwig
and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie
?
( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy
?
) what ever happened to the lawsuit
?
and more
.
.
. all of which were part of tyhe film
and interested me somewhat
. if the onyl idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his
/ her sexuality
,
then that
' s one thing
,
but as many of the relationships
and situations presented themselves in this movei
, i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well
. i didn
' t git it
. the film
' s humor aslo didn
' t tickle my funny bone either
.
then again
, i
' ve seen many a film in these art
- house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter
, while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy onthe the screen
. some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added
" atmosphere
" of a plant called marijuana
, annd i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself smoe nifty visual elements
, in order tothe jazz up that experience
.
but being sober as i was
and expecting a coherent
, funny
, musical with a transsexual twist
, i didn
' t leave the theater very satisfied
. i came out hvaing watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle
, wrapped in metaphors
, dramatics
and more questions than answers
. i will
, on the other h
and
, definitly h
and soem props out tothe the lead in this film
, john cameron mitchell
, who is also the man who wrote
, directed
and created the play on which this movie is based
,
and the tunes
, which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols
, david bowie
and the whole 70s glam
- rock scene
. note
: btw
, it seems as
though pretty much every single
" mainstream
" critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom
( adn
thought that it ws really funny to boot
!
)
, so you might want to take that into consideration yourself
.
but having said that
, the main reason that i started this dinky website in the frist place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the
" official
" critics
, while i
, a regular
" joblo
" in the audience
, just wouldn
' t get what all the fuss was about
. this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews
. where
' s joblo comming fomr
