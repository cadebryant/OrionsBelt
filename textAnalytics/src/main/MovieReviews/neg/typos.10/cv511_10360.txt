, national lampoon introduced us to a new family
- the griswolds
. in 1983
, the griswolds embarked onthe a cross
- country journey with the destination of wally world
, a world
- renowned theme park in california
. we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild
and crazy mishaps the family endured
. two years later
, we watched again as they went to europe
,
and four years after tht
, we shared christmas with them
. now
, eight more years have passed
,
and the laughs have done more than dieu
. they
' ve been cremated
. vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold
, the good intentioned
but ill
- fated father of two
. the premise is basically the smae
. clark has a wonderful idea tothe take his family on a bonding vacation
, this time tothe las vegas
. his wife ellen
( beverly d
' angelo
)
and teenage kids rusty
and audrey
( always played by different actors
- this tyme around
, by ethan embry
and marisol nichols
, respectively
) join him
and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make tyhe backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick
. of course a
" vacation
" movie wouldn
' t be complete without good ole eddie
( reprised by r
andy quaid
)
, the misfit cousin
, showing up at all the wrong times
. there isn
' t too much of a plot here when it comes right down tothe it
. it
' s really just a skit movie
. htere are a couple of ways to define a skit movie
, which is not a real term as far as i know
. the first would be a movie tyhat basically has one running gag for twpo hours
, therefore coming off like a two hour skit
. the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits
, earch lasting about five minutes
. vegas vacation comes off like the first
. a good example of the latter would be last eyar
' s black sheep
. the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast
, annd it doesn
' t really fit into a movie mold
. iin these cases
, a
" plot
"
, which is generally very thin
, is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags
( i
. e
. hve a good vegas joke
, make a vegas movie
)
. such is the case with this movie
' s mini
- plots
. clark gets gambling fever
and begins spending all of the griswold
' s money
, ellen isnt on the verge of an affair with wayne newton
(
!
)
, rusty has a fake id
and isnt using it to his gambling advantage
, adn audrey is desperate for fun
and winds up joining her cousin vickie
( shae d
' lyn
) as an exotic dancer
. the simple fatc is
: this movie isn
' t funny
. at first
, i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes
,
but when the movie got rolling
, my interest suddenly stopped
. chase plays clark griswold really well
. he made the character
and he is the character
. d
' angelo
, to be qtuie honest
, never was too impressive as ellen
,
and this movie doesn
' t show any signs of redemption
. as for the two new griswold kids
, the word
" blah
" comes to mind
. the
" vacation
" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two cahracters
, the simple reason being thgat there is nothing to them
. they
' re so generic
, you
' ll expect the credits tothe read
" girl
# 1 as audrey griswold
"
. vegas vacation differs from teh first threee inaddition the series by more than jstu laugh factor
. yes
, it
' s true that vegas vacation isn
' t even close to being close to being as funny as the others
, which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways
,
but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart
. first off
, why did they leave off the national lampoon
' s heading on the title
? i couldn
' t find any reasons why
,
but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn
' t want to be associated with such a lame film
. that
' s saying a lot
, especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented
: loaded weapon 1
, pcu
, etc
. if they expected this to be another hit
, you would assume tehy
' d be proud to tack onthe the notorious header
,
but for reasons onyl we can guess at
, like the movie sucking
, they didn
' t
. there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact
. the first three films in yhe
" vacation
" series were written by john hughes
, a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80
' s including mr
. mom
, sixteen c
andles
, the breakfast club
, weird science
, pretty in pink
, ferris bueller
' s day off
, planes
, trains
,
and automobiles
,
and uncle buck
. wowzers
! what a r
? sum
?
! looking at the names
, you
' d think this guy wroet everything thyat nowe st
ands as a movie icon for the 1980
' s
. well that
' s not all
. this guy also broght us 90
' s hits including the home alone series
, the remake of 101 dalmatians
, dennis the menace
,
and the current flubber
. vegas vacation
,
however
, didn
' t have john hughes behind it
,
and tyhe loss is very obvious
. tihs time around
, the script is in the h
ands of elisa bell
, whose only credits thus far include four made
- for
- tv movies
. vegas vacation plays very much like one
,
and it would actually work much better as a made
- for
- tv sequel
. if this sounds like a wild diea
, it
' s not
. revenge of the nerds third
and fourth installments were both television movies
,
and they seemed like it
. vegas vaation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2
: 00 a
. m
. sunday morning movie
,
but as a silver screen major motion picture
, it
' s quite out of place
. stephen kessler
' s jejune direction doesn
' t help things either
. he only makse the film even more tv
- movie
- ish
. each consecutive
" vacation
" movie has sufferred a drop in directing power
. we started the series off with harold ramis
, who also directed caddyshack
and groundhog day as well as co
- writing ghostbusters
. not too bad
. thne we had national lampoon
' s european vacation being directed by amy heckerling
, who would go on to direct the hits look who
' s talking
and clueless
, as well as having already directed tghe infamous fast times at ridgemont high
. lastly we hadnt national lampoon
' s christmas vacation
, directed by jeremiah s
. chechik
, who went on to direct the charming benny
& joon
. kessler
, so far
, has one title under his belt
, the short film birch street gym
, whcih received an oscar nomination in 1992
. granted that this was his first attempt at a feature lenght film
, we can allow for some amateurish quality
,
but instead we get a movie straight from the text book
- boring
, bl
and
,
and deeply unoriginal
. if you loved the
" vacation
" movies
,
and i know
* some
* of us did
, htere still isn
' t anything here worth seeing
. if you loved them
, don
' t ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte
. if you never did like the series
, why the need tothe confirm why
?
