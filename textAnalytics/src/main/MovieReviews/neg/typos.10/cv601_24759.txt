so i went
and saw tihs film right
, it ws called
" battlefield
: earth
"
, i was never interested in the previews
,
and never too terribly interested in teh book
, nor do i fidn scientology interesting
,
but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is
, i had that weird urge just to watch it
. well let me be the first to say
,
and so far in my view it ' s safe to sday
: battlefield
: earth might be the worst film i have ever seen
, yes even worse than
" mr
. magoo
"
,
" blue in the face
"
, or
" jaws
: the revenge
"
. roger christianson whos credits include set direction
,
and art direction for such great films as
" alien
"
and
" star wars
"
, directs this film with such amateurism
, that the film looks
and feels
and in fatc sounds so dumb
, that it ' s quite depressing
. the look ofthe the film
, is dark
and drabby at times
,
but
then bright
and happy at other times
. the sound is terrible
,
and has the worst surround sound effects i ' ve heard
. the acting is nothing
, thge dialogue poor
,
and the make
- up effects hideous
. here ' s the so
- called plot
: earth 3000
.
.
.
. man is a endangered species
, while aliens ffrom the planet psychlo
( the aliens are named psychlo
.
.
. i wonder why
?
!
) are invading earth
, destined to put an end to thsoe
" man
- animals
" to an end
,
and destroy earth once
and for all
, ofthe course we have our typical hero
( played terrable by barry pepper
, who was great in a small role in 1999 ' s
" the green mile
"
) who is destined to go out
,
and save his planet
! one thign
: he has to go up aginst
, terl
, the chief ofthe security psychlo
, who is played frankly
, quite bad by john travolta
, whom withthe dreadlocks
, a big head
,
and green eyes jstu doesn ' t work
. of course the sidekick to terl
, is played by
( lol
!
!
) forest whitaker
, who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind
. our friendly human johnny
( barry pepper
) looks just as bad as well
, with long scraggly hair
. i ' m not really sure how to quite explain the badness of tihs film
, except just to say it ' s terrible
. everything in htis film is imcomprehinsable
, from the make
- up effects
, which by the way aren ' t good
, tothe the phony looking special effects
, everything in this film is faulted
. in fact i don ' t remember one part in this entire movie where i wass having a good time
, or enjoying myself
. in fact there is noone part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed
. throughout thge entire 127 minute running time
, i ws dying
, constantly looking at my watch
,
and hoping maybe the projectioner owudl blow a bulb or something
, sadly it didn ' t
. my advice to hollywood
: get new scripts
, new acting classes
, better directors
and damnit
, make films like american beauty more
.
