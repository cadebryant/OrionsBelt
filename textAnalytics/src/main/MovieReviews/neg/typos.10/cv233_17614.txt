at times
, you
' d think edtv would be an entertaining film
. i mean
, who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day
?
but this average joe
, ed perkuny
,
( matthew mcconaughay
)
, is a sappy
, lifeless creation thgat w
anders around
, trying to solve everyone
' s problems
and settle his own
. mcconaughay is awful
, especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard
and torn jeans
. frankly
, he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys
. he overacts in every way
: his overexaggerant body language
, obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance
, adn thyat cliched scene where he loses someone in his life
,
and drops to his knee
and cries
. the rest of the cast is very good
; especially martin l
andau
( as ed
' s step
- father
)
, who plays a cute role as tghe close
- to
- death ood guy that makes all the witty comments
. jenna elfman is good
,
(
but a little overemotional
)
; her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films
, i
. e
. can
' t hardly wait
, annd krippendorf
' s tribe
. woody harrelson
, as ed
' s brother ravy
, does his usual egg
- headed role
, with his comic wit as well
( he wrote a book entitled
,
" my brother pissed on me
.
"
) elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut
, annd dennis hopper
, in a quick cameo as ed
' s biological father
, is a nice choice
( ironically coming after hte role he turned down as christof in the truman show
)
. ellen degeneres stood out as yhe executive who
, after awhile
, decides the show must not go on much to tje oposite of the head exec
, rob reiner
' s opinion
. i hate to compare this film to the truman show
, bu the fact isnt
, i was ashamed to see this movei
. it falt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman
and ed
. edtv had no real wit or genius
; it was typical hollywood
. extracting the tv part of the movie
, you have the simple plotline
: man steals brother
' s girlfriend
, girlfriend leaves town
, man gets new slut girlfriend to feel liek he can move on
, slut breaks uv with him
, real girlfriend comes back
,
and voila
, ytou hve a romance
. i got so restless durring this movei
, i almost walked out
. the only reason it doesn
' t drop below a
" c
" grade is because ofthe the fine supporting performances
. ad2am
" i almost lost my nose
.
.
.
and i like it
. i like breathing through it
