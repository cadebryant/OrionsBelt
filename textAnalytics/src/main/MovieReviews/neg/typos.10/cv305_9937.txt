walt disney studios may have finaly met its match witht the lush animation in twentieth century fox ' s anastasia
.
but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios
, the visuals are teh only thing fox has to brag about
. disney ' s recent classics hvea occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas
, the hunchback of notre dame
,
and to a lesser extent
, hercules
. with anastasia
, fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window
. some may say
- so what
? it ' s just a kid ' s movie
. well
.
.
. if you have young kids
, beware
, as they may be noticeably frightened by thte visuals of a corpse
- rotting rasputin zombie
, whose body parts constinually fall off inthe a disconcertingly rela way
. consdider yourselves warned
. nevertheless
, tje animation is quite stunning at times
. don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout
, occasoinally rivalling photographic quality
.
and
yet in otehr scenes
, the hand
- drawn material seems of the saturday
- morning tv crowd
, which leads me to wonder
.
.
. was this rushed to market to combat disney
? tje plot
, as anyone who hadnt read history before knwos
, concerns the attemp to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs infront 1916
. not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened
. as for the plot
-
-
- go rent disney ' s candleshoe
. yuo ' ll see 60
% of anastasia there
