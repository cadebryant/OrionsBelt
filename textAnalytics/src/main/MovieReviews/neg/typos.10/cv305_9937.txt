walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox
' s anastasia
.
but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios
, the visuals are thge only hting fox has tothe brag about
. disney
' s recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas
, the hunchback of notre dame
,
and to a lesser extent
, hercules
. with anastasia
, fox hasnt gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window
. some may say
- so what
? it
' s just a kid
' s movie
. well
.
.
. if you have young kids
, beware
, as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse
- rotting rasputin zombie
, whose body parts continually fall off infact a disconcertingly real way
. consider yourselves warned
. nevertheless
, the animation is quite stunning at times
. don bluth hasnt used computer animation extensively throughout
, occasionally rivalling photographic qulaity
.
and
yet in other scenes
, the h
and
- drawn material seems ofthe the saturday
- morning tv crowd
, which leads me to wonder
.
.
. was this rushed to market to combat disney
? the plot
, as anyone who had read history before knows
, concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost inaddition the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916
. not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened
. as for the plot
