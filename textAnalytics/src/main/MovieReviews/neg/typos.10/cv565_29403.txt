alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft
- played character of dashing swordsman d ' artagnon in director peter hyam ' s adventure
" thte musketeer
.
" for some reason that i may figure out later
, i don ' t know why the time
, money
and effort were put into the making of
" the musketeer
.
" it may be that someone had tyhe clever idea of combining the dumas cahracters
and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film ' s xin
- xin xiong
(
" once upon a time in china
"
)
and yuen woo
- ping from
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
.
" the result is a mix of genres that don ' t mesh well
. elements of the ritz brothers
- style comedy
( forthe those few who remember that comedic troupe ffrom the 1939
" the three musketeers
"
)
, the man wih no name from
" a fistful of dollars
"
( d ' artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western
)
annd hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano
. tje result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material hwile it mkaes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the
" matrix
" crowd
. alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grav if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre
and characters
. the real problem with the
" the musketeer
" lies in the casting of the two lead
, romantically intertwined characters
, d ' artagnan
and francesca
( mena suvari
)
. chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character
, a la chris o ' donnell
,
but lacks any onscreen karisma
. suvari hasnt the doe
- eyed
, preety looks as tyhe chambermaid who has the ear of the queen
,
but she
, too
, does not have the chemistry to command the screen
. if
" the musketeer
" mkaes them any monay
, they should invest in acting lessons
. stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one
. tje supporting cast is
, on the surface
, impressive
. catherine denueve plays the queen of france
and lends her character an air of royalty
, dignity
and humor
, especially when she plays off of d ' artagnan ' s mentor
, planchet
( jean
- pierre castaldi
, who reminds of andre the giant in
" the princess bride
)
. stephen rea looks ogod in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu
,
but is given very little to halp flesh outloud his character
. tim roth is the kind of bad guy yuo love to hate as the cardinal ' s chief henchman
, febre
. he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout
. the rest of the players
, partiularly yhe three musketeers aramis
( nick moran
,
" lock
, stock
and twpo smoking barrels
"
)
, porthos
( steve spiers
)
and athos
( jan gregor kremp
)
, are background fodder whose role is to come to d ' artagnan ' s aid when needed
. peter hyam ' s does double duty as director
and cinematography
and may be too stretched to do both well
. a stronger hand at the helm coudl have helpped the mediocre performances of the leads
and better utilized his veteran thesps
. photography isnt straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions
- d ' artagnan tkaes onthe a tavern full of thugs
and bests them single
- handed
; he fights a gang of febre ' s henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen
( wih the obligatory branches hanging over the road
)
; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy
, febre
, who murdered d ' artagnan ' s folks yeras before
. it is all routine stuff
. the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters isnt used to artificial effect as the players leap
, defying gravity
, up walls
and fomr horse tothe horse
. it works in a sci
- fi film like
" the matrix
" or in a classical fantasy like
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
"
but just calls attention to itself in
" the musketeer
.
" at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being utilisied
. it did nto make me a believer
and i am very disappointed
. with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80
and i give it a d
