alex
andre dumas meets hong kong acation with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft
- played charachter of dashing swordsman d
' artagnon in director peter hyam
' s adventure
" the musketeer
.
" for some reason that i may figure out later
, i don
' t nkwo why the time
, money annd effort were put into the making of
" the musketeer
.
" it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters
and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film
' s xin
- xin xiong
(
" once upon a time in china
"
)
and yuen woo
- ping from
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
.
" the result is a mix of genres that don
' t mesh well
. elements of the ritz brothers
- style comedy
( forthe those fewd who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939
" the three musketeers
"
)
, the man with no name from
" a fistful of dollars
"
( d
' artagnan dem
ands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western
)
and hong kong acation choreography are all utilized in the original script by ginee quintano
. the result is an action flick taht bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the
" matrix
" crowd
. alex
andre dumas may well be rolling in his grav if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre
and characters
. the real problem with the
" the musketeer
" lies in tghe casting of the two lead
, romantically intertwined characters
, d
' artagnan
and francesca
( mena suvari
)
. chambers has the boyishly h
andsome good looks for tje character
, a la chris o
' donnell
, bu lacks any onscreen karisma
. suvari has the doe
- eyed
, pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen
,
but she
, too
, does not have the chemistry to comm
and the screen
. if
" the musketeer
" makes them any money
, they should invest infact acting lessons
. stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one
. the supporting cast is
, onthe the surface
, impressive
. catherine denueve plays the queen of france
and lends her character an air of royalty
, dignity
and humor
, especially when she plays off ofthe d
' artagnan
' s mentor
, planchet
( jean
- pierre castaldi
, who reminds of
andre the giant in
" the princess bride
)
. stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu
,
but is given very little to help flesh out his character
. tim roth isnt the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal
' s chief henchman
, febre
. he is so bad he makse simon legree look like a boy scout
. the rest of tghe players
, particularly the threee musketeers aramis
( nick moran
,
" lock
, stock
and two smoking barrels
"
)
, porthos
( steve spiers
)
and athos
( jan gregor kremp
)
, are background fodder whose role is to come to d
' artagnan
' s aid whn needed
. peter hyam
' s does double duty as director
and cinematography
and may be too stretched to do both well
. a stronger h
and at the helm could have helpped the medicore performances of the leads
and better utilized his veteran thesps
. photography isnt straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions
- d
' artagnan takes on a tavern full ofthe thugs
and bests them single
- h
anded
; he fights a gang ofthe febre
' s henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect hte queen
( withthe the obligatory branches hanging over hte road
)
; he goes one onthe one with his lifelong enemy
, febre
, who murdered d
' artagnan
' s folks years before
. it is all routine stuff
. the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters isnt used to artificial effect as the players leap
, defying gravity
, up walls annd from horse to horse
. it works in a sci
- fi film liuke
" the matrix
" or in a classical fantasy like
" crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
"
but just calls attention to itself in
" the musketeer
.
" at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire bieng used
. it did nto amking me a believer
and i am very disappointed
. with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80
and i give it a d
