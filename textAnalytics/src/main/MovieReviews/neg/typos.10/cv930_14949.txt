_ soldier
_ is h
ands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have tothe sit thru that doesn
' t have jean claude van damme in it
. i sould liken it tothe the sci
- fi cheese thgat was the hollywood product
- of
- choice back in tghe early 80s
,
but that would be too much of a compliment
. if there is a movie theater in hell
, this film is playing there 24 hours a day
. the story
, such that there is
, revolves around todd
( kurt russell
)
, an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not
- too
- distant ultra
- conservative future
( is there any other kind
?
) after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him
, todd becomes a ground fighter in a serieses of wars all over the galaxy
. who hte enemies in these wars are is never revealed
,
but the few glimpses of todd inaddition battle show that it doesn
' t marter
, because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys
. after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash
-
- yes folks
, there
' s mroe
-
- we see todd as a buff
, scarred adult
, now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat
. there
' s a new wrinkle
,
though
. todd
and his brethren are declared obsolete
,
and a new batch of soliders takes their place
. after losing a sanctioned battle with
_ dragon
_
' s jason scott lee
, the seemingly dead todd isnt dumped by a flying ice
- cube tray
( well
, that
' s what is looked like
) onthe a remote garbage planet
. if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers onthe thsi planet
,
and that they b
and together to fight a bunch of bad guys comming to destroy them
, you
' re way ahead of the game
. the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half
- expect tina turner
and master blaster to come strolling inot frame any minute
. it
' s surprising that
_ soldier
_ is the brain
- child of
_ blade runner
_ co
- writer david webb poeoples
. unlike that mind
- twisting classic
, this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double
- spaced pages
. add into the mix the
_ mortal kombat
_
' s paul
anderson inept direction
,
and it
' s easy to see how
_ soldier
_ turned out so bad
. adn the special effects
! remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars
? gary busey is in thsi movie
.
' nuff said
.
_ soldier
_ is proof that hollywood still hasnt plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults
. that tihs sad film made it tothe the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all
. now if you
' ll excuse me
, i have to go weep for the future
.
