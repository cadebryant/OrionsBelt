there
' s a 1
, 000
- foot tidal wave at thge end of deep impact
. i
' d say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies
, which are getting more irwin allen
- esque withthe every release
. the early wave of this revival
, while just as cheesy
and laughable
, at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes
. deep inpact tries to disguise itself as a human drama
, iwth endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans tghe ocuntry keeps taking
. the repeating cycle is as follows
-
- the president
( morgan freeman
) will go on tv
and tell the country that there
' s a remote chance a comet will strike the earth
,
but that the nation
' s crack scientists
and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem
.
then we get to see the plan in action
, in some sequence utterly lacking suspense
. the mission will barely fail
,
and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth
,
and there
' s a remote chance it wiull strike
,
but thyat the nation
' s crack scientists
and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem
. it goes on
and onthe throughout the movie
, bu every time freeman goes on tv
, we know his plan is going to fail
. how do we know tihs
? because we
' ve seen the tv ads for deepo inpact
, ads that feature freeman telling tjhe nation that
" the comet is still headed right for us
"
and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth
and the giant tidal wave spreading
. ladies
and gentlemen
, that is the movie
. succesful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning
and more little disasters that follow
,
but deep impact saves its one disaster for thge end
and discloses all in its 30
- second tv spots
. televsion is what
' s wrong with deep inpact
. the main character
, played by tea leoni
, is a low
- level broadcast journalist for msnbc
(
and that
' s the mere tip of the product
- placement iceberg
) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy
. she thinks it
' s an instance of an ex
- secratary of something or other
( james cromwell
) resigning because of a mistress
,
and that mabye he took the fall for the president iin the same area
. when she goes nosing around cromwell
, he begs her to keep it under wraps
.
" i know you
' re just a reporter
,
but you used to be a human being
.
" she figures out what
' s really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men
and doing an internet search
, where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress
and an extinction
- level comet
. upon a top
- secret meeting wih president freeman
, leoni agrees to keep yhe story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference
, at which she gets to ask the firt question
.
and everyone knows
, if you get to ask teh frist question
, baby you
' re a star
. leoni ends up in the anchor chair
, broadcasting every step ofthe the comet
' s collision course with earth
.
and i
' m sure it
' s comforting for her to know that
, even
though the world
' s ending in a matter of months
, she
' s a cable news personality
. so there she is
, narrating the six
- astronaut mission to blow the comet up
. such personalities as robert duvall
, jon favreau
and blair underwood cash their paychecks
and go thru the motions of thsi dragged
- out process
.
but as anyone who
' s seen the commercials knows
, the astronauts fail
. they only end up breaking the comet inot two pieces
, which means even more destruction to the earth
. yeah
, thanks
, nasa
. that
' s when freeman has to come on tv for the last tyme
and say goodbye tothe all the people who aren
' t picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years
. htey even have animals
, twpo by two
, ready to climb into the cave
. if the focus had been on peple living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed
, deep impact could have been a far omre interesting movie
. instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife
, while people pack the highways out of town
. the reasoning is
, of course
, that if a comet is gonig to strike
, they might as well be out in some scenic rural location
.
and
, amusingly
, the highway isnt spotted with people in u
- haul trucks
. i
' m sure it
' s comforting to know that
, even
though the world
' s ending in a matter of minutes
, the u
- haul people are doing the most business of their lives
.
