* be warned
.
.
. the following review containes some harsh language
*
*
* the blair witch project
. quite possibly the least scariest movie of all time
. if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back
and watch any scene with jar jar binks in the phantom menace
, because this movie is not scary or even remotely creepy
. my colleague
and friend chuck dowling wroet that if less is more
,
then the blair witch filmmakers must have
thought that nothing is more
.
and this worked for him
. well
, i
' m sorry
,
but nothing
.
.
. is nothing
!
!
!
!
! nothing is not more
. it
' s nothiiiiiinggggggggggg
!
!
!
!
!
!
. i do not pay 5 dollars to see nothing
.
" nothing
" is free
, available all around the world at a location near you
. i am absolutely in amazement that some people fidn this movie scary
. i could just discount them
and say
,
" well
, i guess they are just pansy chicken shits who are propably scared of their own shaddow
.
"
but i have intteligent friends who like this movei anbd so that doesn
' t hold water
. there must be some otehr reason
.
(
then again
, maybe my first
thought is corect
, i think i
' ll try pointing their shadow out to them one day
and test their reaction
.
) when i hear people praising this film
, i never hear them talking about what mkaes up about 97
% of thsi movie
: three kids bickering with each otehr about being lost
. they only talk baout what might make up possibly 3 to 4 minutes of screen time
. this being a few very short night scenes where the kids hear some unscary sounds
and another where they shout
" josh
!
!
" over
and over
. this film should not be called the blair witch project
, it should more accurately be called three dumb
and pisspoor filmmakers get lost
.
.
.
and argue wtih each other
. oh ladies
and gentlemen you will be so scared wehn ytou hear them shouting
" josh
!
!
"
.
and if yuo
thought that was scary
, wait till you see a pile of rocks
,
and
then some tinkertoy lincoln logs
, oh my dear lord yuo will be pissing in your pants with fear
. oh yeah
,
and some goo on one of their backpacks
. you
' ve never seen terror like this folks
,
and you don
' t want to
. the chevy chase
/ goldie hawn comedy foul play is creepier than this film
.
( for current films
, i highly reccommend the sixth sense or a stir of echoes fo a creepy filmgoing experience
.
) this film is an example ofthe marketing with no substance
. the marketing was brillant
, adn the whole nation is in awe of just the premise for the film
. tehy watn this film to be good
.
and i think they are reaching
and praising the wrong movie because they don
' t have anything else to praise
. that wonderful film that rejuvenates the horror genre may come along
,
but this isnt not it
. this film could have been so much better
. just think
, if maybe there had been only 10 minutes of arguing about being lost
,
and 80 minutes of nighttime stuff
. i saw this movie with a girl who was extremely pumped for it
. she was sold on this film
.
and
then
, at one point during it
, she turned to me
and asked
'
.
.
. are we supposed to be scared by this
?
'
. i
' ve heard one oppinion that you
" have to use your imagination
" to create teh fear in this movei
. well
, i
thought that was what the filmmakers were supposed tothe do
. use their imagination
and create a good movie
. i mean anyone can uise their imagination
and not pay 5 bucks for it
.
but even if you like this idea
,
then what are you imagining
? an entity called the blair witch
? some rednecks fucking with these kids
? are either of these things really scary when you think about it
?
?
? i
' ve heard several people say that this movie makes them reacll how scary it can be to be out in the woods
and hear something
. well sure thats scary in real life
,
but there are a lot ofthe thnigs that are scary in real life that are not scary in a movie nor even interesting
. yuo could sit in your house
and see a snake or a spider
and it could be scary
, bu in a film it wouldn
' t be
.
and no
, a movie does not ened a big budget or cgi special effects to be scary or creepy
. actually the less the better
( see the equally awful remake of teh haunting
)
.
but you have to do something
. ytou cant jsut count on us all having nostalgic memories of how something like this could be scary
, if it were real
.
and by hte way
, about the shakycam filming in blair witch
. aren
' t these supposed to be
" filmmakers
" who shoudl know how to point a camera
and shoot something without shaking the camera constantly
? i
' m not even talking about tyhe couple scenes where they are terrified
, that
' s justified
. i
' m talking about the other 87 minutes of the movie where they can
' t seem to shoot anytying smoothly at all
. minor quibble there
. there is a feeling in me that the people that like this movie are suckers
. that hte filmmakers are just laughing their asses off all the way to the bank
.
and i think there is a good chance they will see this film again
and sday to themselves
" what was i thinking
?
?
"
.
but
, if they don
' t
,
then thats fine
. if it works fo them
then that
' s okay i guess
. i just lament that by making this movie a hit
, we are going to be subjected to more ofthe the
" nothing is more
" approach
. pretty soon we
' re going to get soem movies like this
: just a still shot of a prision jail cell
. for 90 minutes
.
and we
' ll have to use our imagination
and think to ourselves
,
" my god
, wouldn
' t it be scary to spend life in prison
?
!
! tihs movei is the scariest movie of all time
!
!
!
!
!
"
. or
, a shot of a coffin
, with some funeral directors arguing withthe each other
.
" man
, do you know how scry it would be to die
?
?
?
!
!
!
! now this is the scariest movie of all time
!
!
!
!
