at first glance
, i thought that the sword
and the sorceror had promise
. its plotline goes like this
: the evil king cromwell
, desiring to take over the world
, resurrects an evil
, ancient sorceror
, xusia for power
. he attacks tghe kingdom of eh
- dan
and kills young prince talon ' s parents
. given a triple
- bladed sword
( which can shoot bad guys
, like a gun
) by his dying father
, talon vows for revenge
. eleven years later
, when he ' s established his own army
, the mercaneries
, he vows tothe take back his kingdom
. allong thte way
, he meets up with alana
, whose village is attacked by drunken guards
anbd her brother is kidnapped by cromwell
. talon vows to help
,
and
, aftter a series of minor escapades
, eventually ends up rescuing alana ' s brother
(
and several other prisoners
)
, onyl to be captured himself
( infact other words
, put on a cross to be crucified
!
)
. fortunately he frees himself
, rescues alana from marrying cromwell
, defeats xusia
,
and
then cromwell
, all with his triple bladed sword
( during the final battle
, thge blade breaks
,
but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade
)
.
then
, everyting ends happily
. unfortunately
, the sword
and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds
. what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping
, bad acting
,
and gruesomely gory
, bloody scenes
. never once does the story seem to connect together
, it just jumps around repeatedly
. this problem is extremely noticebale in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia
. after telling him that he needs his help
, he leads the warlock out into daylight
,
but
thne stabs him
and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards
. wait a minute
, didn ' t the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh
- dan
, which he cannot do by miliraty force
? if that is the case
, why doesnt he dispose of xusia after resurecting him
?
annd why does he manage to take over eh
- dan anyway
? these questions are just never
- no
, never
- answered in the film
. another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life
, another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana ' s wedding to cromwell
(
!
)
,
and finally at the end
, instead of settling down with alana
, he just tells her tothe
" wait
"
,
and
then he jstu rides off
! in adition to the extremely bloody scenes
, this uneven plot jumping completely destroys wqat would have been a great fantasy adventure
. even some attempts to make it exciting
, a few fier scenes
, battle scenes
, don ' t wrok
. it just completely fails altogether miserably
. the only good thing baout this film is its musical csore
, contributed by david whittaker
, who had an
( extremely
) short music composing career
. the score is boomy
and adventurous
, powerful
,
and a billion times better than this film is
. my suggestion
: steer the hell away from this bloody mess
anbd buy the soundtrack album instead
( if you can find it
)
. ironically
,
though
, before the film ' s credits roll
, there is a message indicating that a sequel
, tales of the ancient empire
, would follow
. to my releaf
(
and delight
)
, it never got into production
, because the sword
and the sorcerer layed an egg at the box office
, grossing only
$ 39 million
. critics weere right on inthe slamming the sword
and the sorcerer
, all right
. leonard maltin rightfully called it
" second rate in scripting
,
and acting
"
and at
- a
- glance film reviews called it
" a confusing
, stupid
, unimaginative
, unengaging
, bloodfilled bore
"
. i totally agree with these reviews
, all right
,
and i hope that this peice of
#
$
%
! will be forgotten about
. there are far better fantasy movies than the sword
and tje sorcerer
. i hope you git a good laugh out ofthe this review
,
but i am not laughing
. in fact
, my insults don ' t even come close to the gruesome sickness thgat this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time
.
