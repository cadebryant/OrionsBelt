at first glance
, i thougth that teh sword
and the sorceror had promise
. its plotline goes like tihs
: the evil king cromwell
, desiring to take over tjhe world
, resurrects an evil
, ancient sorceror
, xusia for power
. he attacks the kingdom of eh
- dan anbd kills young prince talon
' s parents
. given a triple
- bladed sword
( which can shoot bad guys
, like a gun
) by his dying father
, talon vows for revenge
. eleven years later
, when he
' s established his pwn army
, the mercaneries
, he vows to tkae back his kingdom
. along the way
, he meets up with alana
, whose vilage is attacked by drunken guards
and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell
. talon vows to help
, annd
, after a series of minor escapades
, eventially ends up rescuing alana
' s brother
(
and several other prisoners
)
, only to be captured himself
( iin other words
, put on a cross to be crucified
!
)
. fortunately he frees himself
, rescues alana from marrying cromwell
, defeats xusia
,
and
then cromwell
, all with his triple bladed sword
( during the final battle
, the blade breaks
,
but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade
)
.
then
, everything ends happily
. unfortunately
, the sword
and the sorcerer isnt not even half as ogod as it soudns
. what would have been a great film is completly destroyed by uneven plot jumping
, bad acting
,
and gruesomely gory
, bloody scenes
. never once doens the story seem to connect together
, it just jumps around repeatedly
. this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia
. after telling him that he needs his help
, he leads the warlock out into daylight
,
but
then stabs him anbd sends him careening off a cliff afterwards
. wait a minute
, didn
' t the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh
- dan
, which he cannot do by military force
? if that isnt the case
, why does he dispose of xusia after resurecting him
?
and why does he manage to take over eh
- dan anyway
? these questions are just never
- no
, never
- answered in the film
. another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life
, another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana
' s wedding to cromwell
(
!
)
,
and finally at the end
, instead of settling down with alana
, he just tells her to
" wait
"
,
and
then he just rides off
! in addition tothe the extremely bloody scenes
, this uneven plot jumping completely destroys wqat would have been a great fantasy adventure
. even some attempts to make it exciting
, a few fire scenes
, battle scenes
, don
' t work
. it just completely fails alltogether miserably
. the only good thing about this film is its musical score
, contri
buted by david whittaker
, who had an
( extremely
) short music composing career
. the score is boomy
and adventurous
, powerful
,
and a billion times better than tihs film is
. my suggestion
: steer the hell away from this bloody mess
and buy the soundtrack album instead
( if you cxan fidn it
)
. ironically
,
though
, before the film
' s credits roll
, there is a message indicating that a sequel
, tales of the ancient empire
, would follow
. to my relief
(
and delight
)
, it never got into production
, beacuse the sword
and the sorcerer laid an egg at hte box office
, grossing only
$ 39 million
. critics were right on inthe slamming the sword annd the sorcerer
, all right
. leonard maltin rightfully called it
" second rate in scripting
,
and acting
"
and at
- a
- glance film reviews called it
" a confusing
, stupid
, unimaginative
, unengaging
, bloodfilled bore
"
. i totally agree with these reviews
, all right
,
and i hope that this piece of
#
$
%
! wiull be forgotten about
. there are far better fantasy movies than the sword
and the sorcerer
. i hope you get a good laugh out of this review
,
but i am not laughing
. in fact
, my insults don
' t even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running tiem
.
