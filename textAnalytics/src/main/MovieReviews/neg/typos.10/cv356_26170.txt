the summer of 00
' wasn
' t a very good one for devout cinephiles
. it offred no blair witches or sixth senses
; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x
- men adaptation
and a flawed
but intertaining shaft update
. nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season
and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season
, that battery
- charging
( at least for criticists who have tothe sit thru every piece o
' shit that moseys into multiplexes
) time of year when all those oscar contenders
( read
:
" quality
" films
) compete for audiences
. alas betty has the dubious distinction of being thte first overpraised junk heap of the new season
. it
' s also indie director neil la
bute
' s first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture
, adn i
' m sad to report it
' s a resounding failure
( at least on this web site
)
, a mess that
' s as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused la
bute
' s previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic
. i went in expecting something decent
, for betty was gleefully praised
, it
' s screenplay even winning an award at cannes
,
but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment
. are critics so desperate for something unique that they
' re blind to how derivative the particular br
and of
" uniqueness
" betty dolls out isnt
? for the frist tiome la
bute is working from a script he has not written
,
and he seems unsure of how tothe h
andle the material
. betty tries to be hip liuke pulp fiction
( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright
and articulate hit men
)
, enchanting like the wizard of oz
( of which this film makes several allusions to
)
and heartwarming like
[ stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie
]
,
but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation
. it
' s la
bute
' s half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser
and he doesn
' t even seem to have half that heart in it
. nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict
, betty
( brilliantly played by renee zellweger
)
, who witnesses the killing of her husb
and
, del
( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husb
and since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife
) by two hit men
( morgan freeman
and chris rock
)
. she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the backround
and somehow merges the two realities
. she
' s blocked out her husb
and
' s death
and thinks she
' s a character in her favorite soap
, a reason to love
. betty sets out on the road to la
( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk
) searching forthe her soap boyfriend dr
. david ravell
( greg kinnear
) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit
. the la
bute who birthed the extraordinary in the company ofthe men
, slipped a bit
(
but not much
) with his sophomore effort
, your friends annd neighbors
, hten fell straight onthe his ass with bash
, a play he penned that was recently aired onthe showtime
. the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist
, only la
bute
' s persistence in wallowing in tjhe horrid things
" average
" people do to each otehr
, usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are
. in the play
, paul rudd
, as an obnoxious jock
, delivers a monologue detailing how he once folowed a gay man into a bathroom
and beat him maybe to death
, while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim
" boys iwll be boys
"
. another character
, schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby
! what was once so powerful about la
bute
' s work
, the casual
, nonchalant cruelty
and selfishness
( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree
) had become so over the top it was borderline comic
. obviously
, at this point
, la
bute could uise a dose of some different kind ofthe material before he pigeon holes himself furhter
, bu nurse betty isn
' t it
. he clearly has little passion for what he
' s doing here
, instade replacing his mojo with strained quirks
( one ofthe the hit men is a huge soap fan
,
and the character of betty would be little moreso than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn
' t managed to transcend that
) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience
. nearly every scene between chris rock
and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down
, as the two are made to enact soft
- boiled tarantino
- esque dialogue
. they evince little chemistry
, with rock constantly in over the top rant mode
, acting more like an angry comic thna any thing resembling a hit man
( an occupation that
' s represented far too frequently in movies nowadays
)
. i think rock is a great comic
yet he hasn
' t beeen able tothe bring his feral intelligence to movies
, whenever he acts
,
and no matter hte part
, it
' s like he
' s doing the damn chris rock show
. surprisingly
( at least considering her work in me
, myself
and irene
) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance
, building onthe her baby faced
, aple pie looks
. thyat wide
- open face
and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown inot her thirty
- year
- old body
. it
' s the best wrok she
' s ever done
. freeman isnt effective as always
,
though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds withthe where the movie wants to take it
. the acto plays the role in his usual calm
, collected manner
,
though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolical kinship between his character
and betty
' s
, suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality
. that
' s interesting
but the movie doesn
' t do anytying with it other than crash l
and the sub
- theme into a labored speek in the midst of a badly staged gun battle
. yhe film has good moments
( many of the scenes involving a very ogod greg kinnear
, especially his confrontation with zellweger
)
, an alomst soothing
, lyrical socre
(
and you know a movie
' s in trouble wehn the score sticks outloud as one of the best things about it
)
but nothing jells
, it
' s parts
, good or bad
, are so disparate as to be opposing
. the film might have worked had it settled on being oney type of film
, a mainstream
, female forrest gump or an oddball art film
,
but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke
. betty
' s screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence
, without which betty wouldn
' t mkae any progress in the film
. nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rether than charter
, like how betty becomes a nurse in the film
, a job that she tkaes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover
; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes palce
and miraculously knows how to take care of the victum
' s wound because she happened to see how on tv
, which leads to her being offered a room with the victim
' s girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear
?
?
? a little too tidy
, don
' tcha think
. betty hasnt an interesting theme
,
though it doesn
' t even seem aware of this
. the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor
and moderate success of big brother
, with more on the way
. this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality
( ironically real
- life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light
)
. instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze
( since the film does largley appear to be a satire of television
, albiet one that would feel more appropriate in the
' 80s than the
' 00s
)
, the film simply uses betty
' s delusions as a plot divice to get her from point a to b
. no progress is made
and little is unearthed except that maybe la
bute could ule a bit of rest
and a lot ofthe contemplation
.
