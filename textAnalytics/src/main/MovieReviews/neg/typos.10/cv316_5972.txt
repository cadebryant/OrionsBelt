i can
' t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good tiem i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did durig feeling minnesota
. for forty minutes or so
, i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over
- wrought romantic comedy
,
and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt
.
then
, rather suddenly
, i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence
; shortly thereafter
, i was whacked in the gut by another
. feeling minnesota is a film that made me efel violated
, as
though i had trusted writer
- director steven baigelman to bring me a kool glass of water
and instead he threw acid in my face
. feeling minnesota tells the story ofthe a topless dancer named freddie
( cameron diaz
) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red
( delroy lindo
) suspects her of stealing fomr him
. red
' s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper
, sam clayton
( vincent d
' onofrio
)
, who is far from the man of freddie
' s dreasm
. enter jjaks
( keanu reeves
)
, sam
' s estranged younger brother
, who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie
' s eye
and have sex with her in the bathroom
. united in their mutual attraction
and their mutual loathing of sam
, jjaks
and freddie take off together
,
but sam isn
' t ready to let them go wihtout a fight
. freddie
, meanwhile
, isn
' t ready to let sam
' s money go without a fight
,
and thus begins a series of violent confrontations
. there is both style
and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota
, as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks
and sam
' s intense sibling rivalry as boys
,
and their mother
( tuesday weld
) sending jjaks away to live with his father
. it does a great job of setting up jjaks
' unstable life
, a life which has l
anded him in trouble for petty crimes
and always trying to please his family
; reeves
' wounded look is just right for jjaks
. the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments
, most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin
. most important
, baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie
and jjaks with humor
and economy
, as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements
'
" i wiull dare
" onthe the car radio
. you would have every reason to expect thyat relationships
-
- both familial
and rumatic
-
- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota
. unfortunately
, you would be dead wrong
. i suppose i should have expected daisies anbd valentines affter an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding
,
but i certainly didn
' t expect what i got
. what i got was
yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags
and brutality
, or rather creating gags about brutality
. suddenly
, the story of romantic entaglements
and family conflict becomes a story baout a corpse
,
and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable
. the sibling rivalry not onyl becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another
,
but htere is no consistency to the characterizations
. vincent d
' onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam
, whose jelusey
, competitiveness
and apparent sense ofthe inferiority seem far more in keeping with whta we knwo about jjaks
, while reeves turns inot a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction
,
and both of them spend most of the second half of tjhe film screaming
and covered in blood
. there are films which have managed tothe employ a radical shift in tone successfully
( jonathan demme
' s something wild
and neil jordan
' s the crying game come to mind
)
,
but they didn
' t try to draw an audiance with thte promise of relatively innocuous entertainment
. i don
' t want to dismiss baigelman
' s successes out of h
and
-
- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop
,
and some well
- crafted comic moments
-
-
and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light
- hearted caper
. it
_ is
_ his fault that he violates his pwn characters for the sake ofthe shock value
,
and that he can
' t make his two halves into a whole
. feeling minnesota left me feeling used
,
and there
' s not much funny about that
.
