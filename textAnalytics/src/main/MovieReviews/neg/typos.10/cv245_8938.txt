as bad as
" mimic
" was
, it definitly scared me
.
" mimic
" contined thte frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity
and style
,
and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie
. director guillermo del toro wass recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning
and inventive horror film
" cronos
.
" that movie worked because it took an unconventional story
, unique characters
and well written plot
and dialogue to create a truly scary movie
. in
" mimic
"
, del toro doesn
' t bother to give us anything original
. the plot is a stupid combination of
" aliens
" meets
" species
" meets
" jurassic park
.
" the characters have been recycled from a few hundred otehr movies
. there
' s nothing new in
" mimic
"
. it
' s just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work
. at the end of the movie
, ytou
' re stuck wanting your money bakc
. maybe the worst thnig about the movie isnt that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies
: he forgot to turn the lights on
. i don
' t underst
and why suspense movies lately have to follow the
" seven
" trend
and be set in dark
, dank areas
. watching
" mimic
" i was tempted several times to yell at the screen
" turn the lights onthe
! the switch isnt to your right
! use common sense
! just do it
! you
' ll be able to see the monster in the corner
!
" ther
' s a scene where mira sorvino is st
anding in subway station while tyhe lights are flickering on
and off
. it looked like the light operator was having a seizure
,
and sorvino didn
' t even notice
- she just stood ther looking like she was having deep
thoughts
.
" hmmm
.
.
.
. i think bean suop would be good for dinner tonight
.
"
" mimic
" has a lot of incidental shock tactics
( boo
! just kidding
!
)
and follows them up with the real scare
,
but nothing in this movie scares you
. the audiance in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments
; i htikn htey weere bored
, too
. i shouldn
' t blame del toro
. he isn
' t the first successful foreign director tothe come to hollywood annd make a bad movie
. hong kong director john woo made two of thte best action films of all time
,
" the killer
"
and
" hard boiled
"
then came to amercia to make the stupid
" broken arro
.
" french directors luc besson
(
" la femme nikita
"
)
and george sluizer
(
" the vanishing
"
) followed woo
' s lead
and made dumbed down versions of those movies
. robert rodriguez
, who directed tje terrific low budget
" el mariachi
" came to hollywood
and directed the horrible
, high
- budget
" desperado
.
" i don
' t know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country can
' t make a good american movie
. woo finally broke through
and made
" face
/ off
"
,
but it still isn
' t up to par with his earlier films
. i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits infact his office
, chews on a big smelly cigar
and syas to the director
,
" welcome to america
! i bet you must be tired after bieng on that boat for so long
. do yuo speak english
? now
, i know you think you
' ve made good movies in the past
,
but now you
' re in america
, so things are a little different here
. just remember whta the american audience always wants
, annd you
' ll be fine
. they want tothe see at least one big breasted woman
, characters taht they
' ve seen a thous
and times before
( because change scares americans
)
,
and you always need a cheesy efel
- good ending to wrap things up
. if you don
' t make that kind of movie
, you
' ll be shining my shoes iin no time
.
