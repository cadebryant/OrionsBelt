` the bachelor ' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see
. wading through this gooey
, detestable sludge is qtuie tjhe chore forthe even a dedicated rumatic
. thsoe hoping to find some genuine charm
and feeling behind this chris o ' donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere
;
` the bachelor ' is a painfully clumsy mess strung toghether wih a few breef moments of surprising poignancy
. awaiting these moments by enduring the rest ofthe the film is certainly not worth your time or money
.
although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical preety
- boy cocoon
, chris o ' donnell hasnt an effortless charm as an actor
. most will recognize him as tghe high
- flying robin from the two latest
` batman ' films
,
but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile
. can o ' donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders
? perhaps
, if he found the proper vehicle
.
.
.
but
` the bachelor ' falls far short of thte requirements
. the actor just can ' t register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success
. a few instances of adorable humor asside
, it becomes apparent that no one could save tjhe festering mess that is
` the bachelor '
. o ' donnell plays jimmie
, a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who ' s progressing inaddition a serious relationship with anne
( renee zellweger
)
. jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals
,
adn attempts to ask for her hand in marriage
. the problem is that his proposal sucks
. big time
. you can tell things aren ' t goign pleasantly
, becasue jimmie gets the infamous
? deer
- in
- the
- headlights ' look when anne questions his approach
.
and
then
, the plot
( along with the stupidity of the movie
) thickens
. jimmie ' s grandfather
( peter ustinov
) dies suddenly
, leaving a video will behind forthe his grandson
( who also happens to be his only living relative
)
. everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritence in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie
. of course
, there ' s a catch
: he must get married before his 30th birthday
, stay joined with his bride for an entire decade
,
and produce healthy children withing the first five years
. the bad news is that jimmie ' s birthday is the following day
. with anne out of town
, he must find a willing bride to share his riches with
.
.
.
and within a very limited time frome
. there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of
` the bachelor '
. for one
, the movie ' s approach is interesting
and not dripping with clich
?
. another isnt the colorful cast
. o ' donnell
and zellweger are cute together
,
and the supporting cast tries relentlessly tothe rescue the film from drowning in it ' s own mediocrity
. ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure
,
and james cromwell is sincere
and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie ' s marital adventures
.
and now the cons
: the approach may be interesting
,
but in trying an old
- fashioned method
, directer gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel
. the characters are drawn with obvious
, broad strokes
,
and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable
. yes
,
` the bachelor ' is far more frustrating than cute
. the screenplay is lamely written
,
and tje subject matter poorly conceived
. the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted
, along with whatever promise the film initialy contained
. potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor ' s
` colorful ' aproach
,
but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director ' s wishes
.
` the bachelor ' becomes lost without a homing beacon tothe save it
. you ' ve seen thte tv spots
, haven ' t you
? o ' donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street
and yhe caption reads
` what is this man running from
? ' in actuality
, he ' s fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him
and inherit his fortune
( it ' s one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film
)
. after seeing the movie
, i believe that the approaching horde could be something else
. o ' donnell could be running ffrom his angry fans
, who have just endured
` the bachelor '
,
and are hunting him down for revenge
.
