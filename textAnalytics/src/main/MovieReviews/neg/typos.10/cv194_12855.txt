this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regluar cast anbd it is the swansong ofthe hattie jacques
and sid james
. dick turpin
( sid james
)
and his gang which includes harriett
/ harry
( barbara windsor
)
and tom
" doc
" scholl
( peter
butterworth
)
, terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies
:
" st
and
and deliver
!
" owing to tghe increased occurrnece of turpin
' s robberies
, captain desmond fancey ofthe the bow street runners
( kenneth williams
)
and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp
( jack douglas
) visit turpin
' s area of influence to bring him to justice
. tehy are under yhe express orders of sir roger daley
( bernard bresslaw
)
. their intellect does not count for much
and when they increasingly become suspicious ofthe rever
and flasher aka dick turpin
( sid james
)
, whom they confided in earlier
, they still cannot believe that tyhe rector has any part in these robberies
.
however
, once they catch harriett anbd put her in jail
,
and sir roger daley takes complete charge
, it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin
.
then again
, sir roger has assigned thge dimwits fancey anbd jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable
( kenneth connor
) to keep an eye on their prisoner
! there is no doubt that this is a
' sid james
' carry on movie
. he excels in double roles
( as in
' carry on
- don
' t lose your head
'
)
and his performance as flasher
and turpin is hilarious
. barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid
and member of the gang
, annd hattie jacques
' small
but effective role as the rector
' s housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection
. jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on
- screen persona
and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part
. peter
butterworth isnt not allowed to shine inwhich his boring peformance as toom
,
and bernard bresslaw
' s character appears onyl briefly in the film
. the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree
, who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the
' birds of paradise
'
and sporting a fake french accent
. when her girls
and her are robbed by turpin
, she is determined to catch him
and helps the reverend to find the culprit
! a carry on by the numbers
, this movei is only notable for the grat peformance by sid james in his last carry onthe movie
. the jokes are bluer
, the script is poorer
( it is thge last script written by talbot rothwell
)
,
but the music is a marked improvement
.
al
though nearly all the regulars appear
, they seem to be just gonig through the motions
. none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here
. just a selection of crude jokes adn repititive doublely
- entendres
.
