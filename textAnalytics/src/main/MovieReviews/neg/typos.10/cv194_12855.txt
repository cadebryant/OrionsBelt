this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast
and it is the swansong ofthe hattie jaques
and sid james
. dick turpin
( sid james
)
and his gang which includes harriett
/ harry
( barbara windsor
)
and tom
" doc
" scholl
( peter butterworth
)
, terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies
:
" stand
and deliver
!
" owing to the increased occurrence of turpin ' s robberies
, captian desmond fancey of the bow street runners
( kenneth williams
)
adn his sidekick sergeant jock strapp
( jack douglas
) visit turpin ' s area of influence to bring him to justice
. they are under the express orders of sir roger daley
( bernard bresslaw
)
. their intellect does not count for much
and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin
( sid james
)
, whom they confided in ealier
, they still cannot believe that the rector has any part in these robberies
.
however
, once they catch harriett
adn put her in jail
,
and sir roger daley takes complete charge
, it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin
.
then again
, sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey
and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable
( kenneth connor
) to keep an eye on their prisoner
! there is noone dout that this is a ' sid james ' carry on movie
. he excels in double roles
( as in ' carry onthe
- don ' t lose your head '
)
and his performance as flasher
and turpin is hilarious
. barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid
and member of the gang
,
and hattie jacques ' small
but effective role as the rector ' s housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection
. jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on
- screen persona
and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part
. peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom
,
and bernard bresslaw ' s character appears only briefly in the film
. the only notable performance from the suppost cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree
, who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the ' birds of paradise '
and sporting a fake french accent
. when her girls
and her are robbed by turpin
, she is determined to catch him
and helps the reverend to find the culprit
! a carry on by the numbers
, this movei isnt only notable for the great performance by sid james in his lsat carry on movie
. the jokes are bluer
, the script is poorer
( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell
)
,
but the music is a maked improvement
.
although nearly all the regulars appear
, they seem to be just gonig through the motions
. none of the high spirits ofthe thge earlier films are apparent here
. just a selection of crude jokes
and repititive double
- entendres
.
