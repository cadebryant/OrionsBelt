. critique
: i ' ve been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now
,
but hold on tothe your brooms
and incantations
, cause this puppy is far ffrom being it
! for a film that has teh word
" magic
" in its title
, this movie contains very few moments of magic
.
.
. or humor for that matter
, drama
, suspense
, or romance
. well atcually
, there is some manufactured romance within a plot that isnt so muddled
, it never lets you in on whether it ' s a comedy
, a drama
, a horror show
, or a murder mystery
. or maybe it ' s a romance
, eh
? it doesn ' t really matter
, cause the characters in the film are so boring
and uninteresting
, that ytou have absolutely no basis on which tothe care for them
, or the film as a whole
. if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious sountrack
, this film might ' ve had a chance to be more than what it is now
. which is an unentertaining
, crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us awya ffrom its grab
- bag of stupid voice
- overs
, overdone songs
, melodramatic romance
, undeveloped story
and uneven acting
. i only wish that i could mkea that one hour
and fourty
- five minutes of my life re
- appear
,
but alas
, it is lost in the spiritual world ofthe
" interesting ideas gone wildly awry
