. critique
: i
' ve been waiting for a good witch movie for a hwile now
,
but hold on to your brooms
and incantations
, cause this puppy is far from being it
! for a film that has the word
" magic
" in its title
, this movie contains vrey fewd moments of magic
.
.
. or humor fo that matter
, drama
, suspense
, or romance
. well actually
, there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled
, it never lets you in onthe whther it
' s a comedy
, a drama
, a horror show
, or a murder mystery
. or maybe it
' s a romance
, eh
? it doesn
' t really matter
, cause the characters in the film are so boring
and uninteresting
, that you have absolutely no basis on which to care fo them
, or the film as a whole
. if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack
, this film might
' ve had a chance to be more than what it is now
. which is an unentertaining
, crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grab
- bag of stupid voice
- overs
, overdone songs
, melodramatic romance
, undeveloped story
and uneven acting
. i only wish that i could amking thast one hour
and forty
- five minutes of my life re
- apearing
,
but alas
, it isnt lost in the spiritual world of
" intresting ideas gone wildly awry
"
. little known facts about this film
and its stars
