the spy game is up
. you can thank charlie
' s angels
-
- the movei
-
- for that
. when did banality
and p
andering become okay
? just steal from hong kong
, the matrix
,
and a kitschy tv show from the mid
- 1970s
and that
' s a movie
? charlie
' s angels is one of yhe worst examples of action film homogeneity
and shameless duplicity in any film i
' ve seen in aegs
. charlie
' s angels is dumb
. just plain dumb
. as we all know
, three of the hottest females on the planet
-
- drew barrymore
, cameron diaz
,
and lucy liu
-
- are three super
- agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie
. they all drive fast cars
, look oh
- so
- fabulous even in the morning
,
and don
' t seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men
, having buildings explode ten feet inspite front of them
, or flying thru the air in matrix slow
- motion
.
and while teh entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage
- busting wetsuits
, cleavage
- busting waitress uniforms
,
and cleavage
- busting wet t
- shirts
, they scarcely succeed in ressembling so much as a group of annoying
, drunk sorority girls
, the kind who hit onthe everybody at a party
. the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story ofthe a millionaire computer engineer
-
- the great sam rockwell
-
- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company
. of course
, the rival wants control of his new personal identification system
, which involves such latter
- day buzzwords as gps
, cellular tracking
,
and even mainframe
. the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to hte angels
-
- like battling eahc ofthe them in many round
- robin matrix rip
- off
( agian
) fight sequences
and harboring a strange attraction to sliced
- off locks of the angels
' hair
. the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley
, serving as charlie
' s manservant
, or
, more to the point
, the angels
' pimp
. the rest of thte movie comprises a revenge arc
, enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables
, carbon
- copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan
and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intelectual property theft
,
and hte stange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke
' s long
- lost brother
. charlie
' s angels starts off with a bang annd ends up being a soggy burrito left outloud overnight
. nothing isnt difficult
, plausible
, or believable in any of the angels
' actions
. it feels like the matrix
, mission
: impossible 2
,
and cleopatra jones anbd the casino of gold all rolled into one
. diaz is a knucklehead
. barrymore isnt the
" dangerous one
,
" mean
and tough
and about as believable as katie holmes in the role
. liu is just
.
.
. lucy liu
, looking good in a skin
- tight balck leather suit
. tje list of movies fomr hwihc charlie
' s angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing
. hte writers apparently ran the copier all nigth stealing scenes from armageddon
, lethal weapon ii
, all of jackie chan
' s movies
, the great escape
, saterday night fever
, revenge of the nerds
, payback
, darkman
, dr
. no
, the matrix
( as mentioned
)
,
and even tv
' s friends
. it
' s a shame
, too
, because one of thte many screenwriters
, john august
, was at the helm of lastr eyar
' s favorite
, go
.
then again
, what can you expect from a director known solely as
" mcg
.
" ther isnt no camp value in the film
, no interesting main characters
, no invigorating action scenes
, noone reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks
and enjoy thte performances of a few supporting players
. note to hollywood
: next time
, let
' s leave the tv shows on the tv
.
