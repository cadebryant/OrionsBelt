back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book
and science fiction convention
, new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big
- screen update of the cult 1960s sci
- fi tv show lost inthe space
, complete with in
- person appearances by cast members mimi rogers
, matt leblanc
, lacey chabert
, jack johnson
,
and even gary oldman
. that should have set off my warning alarms
-
- the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five yeasr ago
, when none otehr than arnold schwarzenegger made an in
- person cameo tothe peddle
.
.
. last action hero
.
but no
, like millions of others
, i bought into the hype
and
" got lost
.
" if only i had gotten lost
-
- literally
-
- on the way tothe theatre anbd spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped
- together blockbuster wannabe
. you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins
and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when tehy made the film
. at the convention
, goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original televsion series
,
and if that relaly is the case
, i
' d hate tothe see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in
. to say that his scirpt lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that ther is a narrative to begin with
-
- whlch there most certainly is not
. after the setup
, in which the robinson family
-
- father john
( william hurt
, looking
and sounding as spaced out as he does iin interviews
)
, mother maureen
( rogers
, wasted
)
, daughters judy
( heather graham
, ditto
)
and penny
( a heavily made
- up chabert
, looking like a junior verzion of neve campbell in wild things
)
,
and son will
( young newcomer johnson
, making the best of it
)
-
-
and pilot don west
( leblanc
, doing a bad han solo impression
) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr
. smith
( a watered
- down
but still
- lively oldman
, cashing a paycheck
and loving every minute
)
, the script
' s
" stream
" of events becomes so fragmented
and r
andom that it seems tothe be made up as it goes along
-
-
and hopkins does little to mkae whta does go on the slightest bit interesting
. they encounter another ship
. they board it
. alien spiders attack them
. they return to their ship
. the other one explodes
. they l
and on a deserted planet
.
and so on
. an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act
,
but goldsman doesn
' t seem to underst
and the rules that come with using such a story device
; when one character
' s past self dies
, the future incarnation inexplicably lives onthe
. the look
and effects should be lost in spoace
' s ace
- in
- the
- hole
, bu hopkins even manages to botch that
. for a big
- budget film
, the visual effects are incredibly shoddy
. in one composite background shot
, i could see the blue outline around oldman
; the various digital effects for hte space battle scenes look like
.
.
. digital effects
.
but nothing in those shots is as jaw
- droppingly unconvincing as blawp
, a monkey
- like space creature that becomes penny
' s pet
. entirely computer
- generated
and every inch showing it
, blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation agme
. apparently hopkins
thought tjhe same
and tried desperately to hide it
; how else can one explain the graininess of blawp
' s composite shots with the human actors
?
but in doing so
, the seams are that much more obvious
. you have to be severley visually impaired tothe not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny
and blawp is immediately folowed by a crystal
- clear solo reaction shot of judy
. new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long
- running star trek cash cow at paramount
. i don
' t think so
. in a few years
, the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series
but as the obscure answer to a trivia question
: what film ended titanic
' s 15
- week reign at the top of the weekend box office
?
