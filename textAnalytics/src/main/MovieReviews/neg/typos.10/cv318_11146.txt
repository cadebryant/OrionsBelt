. comments
:
" alan smithee
" directed futal charm
, which should have been more appropriately titled
" fatal bore
" or
" futal crap
"
. if you find out that a film ytou
' re about to see is directed by
" alan smithee
,
"
then you should seriously
, seriously
, seriously consider watching something
, anything
, else
.
" alan smithee
" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad
. frankly
, i
' d be embarrassed if i hadnt directed this turkey
, so i think i underst
and why tjhe director might have picked the
" alan smithee
" moniker for this film
. where to begin with this painfully poor thriller
? let
' s start with the acting
. it
' s pretty bad
. am
anda peterson plays valerie
and shows at least some talent
( the rest of the cast don
' t
)
, even
though her performance isn
' t exactlly stellar material
. she
' s allso miscast
; she seems way too ood to still have a year of high skool to complet
. her scenes with valerie
' s mother
, played by mary frann
, are a joke
. tjhe two look as
though they
' re a couple of coworkers going out tothe lunch together
, rether than a daughter with her mother who just doesn
' t underst
and
. christopher atkins
, a h
andsome enough actor who plays the killer
, adam
, looks like a clown inspite the second half of fatal charm
. trying to appear malicious
and dangerous
, he wears large sunglasses anbd a half
-
buttoned jacket
. if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about yhe unabomber
, atkins would probably be a perfect c
andidate for the lead
,
but he doesn
' t cut it here
. early on in thge movie
, a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom
. outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers
, the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film
. they constantly shift annd turn
and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a larg group of people haev given at one time ever
. fatal charm
' s storyline
, such as it is
, inspires more yawns than thrills
. the script belabors a red herring
, early on
, about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for hwihc adam
( atkins
) is charged with
. this suspect
,
however
, turns up strangled
and drowned halfway through tje film
: an obvious plot fault
. even for thge idiots who didn
' t consider the movie
' s title as valerie
and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent
and charming the defendent seemed
, it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when hte other suspect washes uv
. so
, the audience must wait
( if they haven
' t aleady stopped watching
) as the necessary details fall into place
and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn
- out finale
. the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an
" erotic thriller
"
. a thriller it isn
' t
,
and neither is it particularly erotic
. i cant
' t imagine
, if someone were in the mood for something
" erotic
,
" tht he
' d be happy after watching thsi fluff
. a few erotic moments occur in the film
; they take palce in a van with little lighting
and are filmed out of focus
( see
, they
' re supposed to be valerie
' s fantasies
-
- how creative
)
. on a personal note
, i was disturbed by thge ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through
. it
' s no wonder why she hated high school so much
. as an instructor of english myself
, i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature
, a teacher would stoop to reading a student
' s bad poetry
( of course
, it
' s valerie
' s
) about boyfriends out loud
and
then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the peom
' s insperation
. i guess the public school system is still setting dubious st
andards for its students
. fatal charm won
' t charm anyone
, unless ther
' s someone that
' s charmed by boring
, lifeless
, insipid
, suspenseless thrillers
. if yuo happen upon htis turkey
, just keep moving on
.
