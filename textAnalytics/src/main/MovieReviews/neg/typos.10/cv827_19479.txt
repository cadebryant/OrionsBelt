tje best thing about
,
" lake placid
" is that it
' s only 80 minutes long
and when it
' s over you
' re glad that you didn
' t waste more than an hour
and a half of your tiem
. it
' s nothing mroe than a bad rip
- off of
,
" jaws
"
( adn i think that
' s bieng kind
.
) it was written by david e
. kelly
(
" ally mcbeal
"
) as a horror
- comedy
but fails at both
, miserably
. i was never scared
and i think tath i only laughed once
. the crocodile even fails in comparison to the snake in
,
" anaconda
.
" the plot begins when a man is eaten infront half by the giant crocodile iin black lake in maine
. that brings the local sheriff
( brendan gleeson
)
and a fish
-
and
- game warden
( bill pulman
) to investigate
. also
, a paleontologist
( bridget fonda
) from new york is sent to look at a tooth
and an eccentric millionaire
/ crocodile lover
( oliver platt
) flies in beccause he wants to swim beside the beast
. soon there is tension between everybody because half the people want to kill the croc
and the other half want to save it
. there
' s also an eccentric old lady
( betty white
) who lives by the lake
and hasnt a few secrets
. as i mentioned befoer kelley
and directer steve minor
( h20
) don
' t go for a sereous approach towords thte material
but they also don
' t have anything sly or satirical or witty to say either
. the betty white character is completely unfunny anbd none of the other characters are really that interesting
, they
' re all basically idiots
. if htey had any brains tyhe croc wouldn
' t have been that much of a challenge tothe catch
and they wouldn
' t have put themselves in half of tje situations that they did
.
but
then again
, if they were smart there wouldn
' t be a movie
. basically
,
" lake placid
" is best undiscovered
.
