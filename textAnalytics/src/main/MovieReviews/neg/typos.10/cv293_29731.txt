' the three musketeers is noe of the most often
- adapted literary works
,
and for good reason
: the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story
. perhaps the musketeer
, a new film that
" reimagines
" the novel in the spirit
and style of the matrix
, is one adaptation too many
. it
' s just awful
: spiritless
, silly
and unforgivably boring
, transforming the timeless classic into a mish
- mash of old
- as
- time clich
? s
and incoherent
, repetitive action sequences
. this time
, d
' artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers
, who can
' t even pronounce his character
' s name
. as a boy
, he watched his father get killed by febre
( tim roth
)
, a lackey of power
- hungry cardinal richelieu
. he vowed to have vengeance
. after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman
, he goes looking for his enemy
. on his quest
, he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government
. the royal musketeers have lost their gusto
, what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal
' s own guards
. only a fewd loyal swashbuckers remain
, among them athos
and portos
( who are only figureheads in this movie
)
. together with d
' artagnan
, they fight to extricate the queen
( catherine deneuve
) fomr the traps that febre
and richelieu are trying to plant
. oh
, adn as an after
thought
, d
' artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn
( mena suvari
)
. just
thought i
' d mention that
. now
, look
: i don
' t nkwo whose idae this ws
,
but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue
- lashing
. i have nothing against
" modernizing
" classic works of literature
- at the veyr least
, they can inspire viewers to actually read the book
-
but films as dull as this have noone positive side effects
. director peter hyams
, known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop
and end of days
, has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas
' masterwork
: the sense of excitement
, cause
,
and cameraderie
. instead
, we get impressively choreographed
but somehow vacuous
, uninvolving acation sequences that emerge from emptiness
and lead to nothing
. when the musketeers finally git to holler
" all for one
,
and one for all
,
" i coudl have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i falt
. maybe the reason for the utter lack ofthe suspense here is the hyams
' s tone
, which is unreasonably dark
and brooding when you consdider the reader
' s digest condensed version of teh story thast he gives us
. it
' s as
though anything that may have been construed as
" fun
" was purposely expunged from the prodcution
. the joylessness of the proceedings
, from the oppressively shady lighting to the mecanical fight scenes
, cant be felt in every frame
. chambers can
' t act
; suvari
, roth
and deneuve can
,
but aren
' t given the chance
.
and when push comes to shove
, the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious
,
though at least roth gets to play a villain wihtout having to mear an ape suit
. some movies seem sloppy
and careless
, clearly made for a quick buck
. with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful
. the film is intricate
, stylish adn precise
, hitting the wrong note every single time
.
