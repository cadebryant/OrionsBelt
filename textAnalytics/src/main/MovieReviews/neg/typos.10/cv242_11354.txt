" spice world
" is just one long promotional film for the british girl b
and the spice girls
. sure there
' s a hint of humor in there every once in a while
. actually
, there
' s a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls
.
but overall
, who cares
? not me
. if you don
' t know by now
, the spice girls sing songs of love anbd friendship
and responsibility
and girl power
,
yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neigbourhood
. in
" spice world
" they ride around in their big tour bus
, whining about having to do photo shoots
and give interviews
. amazingly
, all the talk they do about keeping commitments
and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things
, things they want to do
, not things they are required to do tothe keep earning money
.
and tehy keep babbling about
" girl power
" when they should really be talking about
" cleavage pwoer
"
. i mean
, if all it takes is girl power
,
then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits
? tghe film isnt pg
,
but really with only some very minor dialogue changes annd scene extentions
, you
' d ahve youself one raunchy adult film
. by the way
, there
' s something in the opening credits whitch says
" based on an idea by the spice girls
"
. wow
, htey got diea credit
! i certainly wish tath was a new trend in hollywood
.
.
. giving credit for simply having the
thought
" say girls
, let
' s amke a movie
!
" the supporting cast fares well
. roger moore
( the real james bond
) mockingly plays the cliche
- spewing
" cheif
" of hte spice girls
, anbd darn it all
, he
' s fun to watch
. mark mckenney allso is good as a screenwriter trying to pitch film ideas tothe the b
and
' s manager
( richard e
. grant
)
. one question
though
: george wendt
? you
' d thikn that
" spice world
" would envoke one of two reactions in peple
. if you like the spice girls
, you
' ll like them even more afterwards
.
and if you can
' t st
and them
( like me
)
,
then
" spice world
" will really mkea you sick
. oddly
, the audience i saw the film with
, roughly 50 twelve eyar
- old girls
, sat in silence for the entire film
. well
, not the two who sat directly behind me
. they kept muttering
" thsi is stupid
" over anbd over again
. maybe there is hope for humanity after all
.
