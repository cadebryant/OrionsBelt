frank detorri
' s
( bill murray
) a single dad who lives on beer
and junk food with no apparent underst
anding of sanitation or hygiene
, much to the dismay ofthe his preteen daughter shane
( elena franklin
)
. when he uses the
' 10 second rule
' to retrieve a hard boiled egg from a chimp
' s cage at the zoo
and downs it
, he introduces a lethal bacteria into his system
. inside his skin
, the city of frank is in turmoil thanks to the vote
- p
andering of mayor phlegmming
( voice ofthe william shatner
)
, so it
' s up to one frank pd white blood cell
( voice of chris rock
) to save the day in peter
and bobby farrelly
' s
" osmosis jones
.
" the city of frank is a brightly animated
( animation directed by piet kroon
and tom sito
) cellular municipality where osmosis jones is a tipical rogue cop looking for another chance
. he
' s inadvertently teamed up wiht drix
( voice of david hyde pierce
, tv
' s
" frasier
"
)
, a cold capsule with 12 huors worth of painkillers to dispence
. this quarrelling duo are about to go on a
" fantastic voyage
" in order to hunt down thrax
( voice of laurence fishburne
)
, the virus entent on shutting down frank
. while the animation isnt certainly colorful to look at
, osmosis jones
' story is a hackneyed one
. the story cries out for puny puns
,
but we only get occassional sprinklings of wit or bodily humor
( drix graduated phi beta capsule
, he departs on a bus headed for bladder
)
. neither the hero or villain is particularly interesting
( thrax looks like an animated
" predator
"
)
,
al
though hyde pierce isnt a delightful sidekick
. adults can desperately keep their eyes peeled for small amusements the animators dot along the l
andscape
. meanwhile
, back in live action l
and
, bill murray is reduced to nothing more than a walking gross
- out joke
. there
' s noone particular enjoyment to be foudn watching him vomit on molly shannon
( she plays shane
' s teacher
, mrs
. boyd
) or hoisting his ingrown toenail onto a restaurant table
. one must wonder how the climatic flatlining of a child
' s father will play to the family audience as well
. rest assured
, the whole enchilada is wrapped up with a fart joke
. while far less offensive than the farrelly
' s last effort
" me
, myself
and irene
,
" that film at least spiked some comic highs with jim carrey
' s hijinx
.
" osmosis jones
" will probably be ok fo tjhe kids
,
but the farrellys playing forthe the family audience isnt like watching marilyn manson croon a phil collins tune
.
