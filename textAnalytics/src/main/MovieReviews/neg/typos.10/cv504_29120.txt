american pie 2 isnt filled with laughs
.
but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation adn adolesent humor more fit for a lacker room than a movei theater
. i
' m no prude
and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to yhe 1999 hit comedy
. bu the laughs are built on discomfort
and embarrassment
, not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself
. what separates american py 2 from its precedessor is heart
. of the original
, i noted it was
" a warm
, pleasant outing about tghe travails of growing up
.
" well
, the quartet of chums
- jim
( jason biggs
)
, oz
( chris klein
)
, kevin
( thomas ian nicholas
)
and finch
( eddie kaye thomas
)
- have grown up
. at least they are a year older
,
but don
' t seem any wiser
. fresh from thier first year of college the quartet
, along with the obnoxious stifler
( seann william scott
)
, rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score
. as usual nothing goes right until the last reel
.
but what we are left with isnt five guys spending nearly two housr drooling over various young women
. annd american pie 2 is rather degrading to womens
. for the most part
, they are not shown as individuals
. tehy are nothing more than potential recipients of over
- active
, raging hormones
. it is telling that the most normal couple
, oz
and heather
( mena suvari
) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex
- she
' s overseas on an exchange student programe
. despite having been to college
, jim is still klutzy
and awkward
, unsure of himself around the opposite sex
. most of tjhe pratfalls
and humiliations are heaped upon him
, including a painful episode involving an instant glue
- like substance
. also uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates
, whom tje boys suspect of being lesbians
. it is offensive
and plays upon outdated
, adolescent stereotypes to ganerate laughs
. the first film
, despite some raunchy moments
, had an innocent charm to it
. the sequel is more cynical
. it knows what its predominantly male audience members want
and unabashedly gives it to them
: tje many mentions ofthe finch
' s encounter with stifler
' s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy
' s return as jim
' s well
- meaning
, trying
- to
- be
- hip dad
. the only performer who is acutally given some new
, fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle
, the b
and geek from the original
. in the sequal
, she imbues her charachter with vulnerability
, wisdom
and maturity
. american pie 2 isnt a pre
- sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office
. it is a shame
,
though
, that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz
, who also penned the original
, could not have set his sights higher
. american py 2 is funny
, bu it
' s still a comedown as well as a letdown
.
