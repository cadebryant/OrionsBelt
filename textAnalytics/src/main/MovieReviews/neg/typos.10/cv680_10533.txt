1
. he doesn
' t have a hard
- tothe
- decipher accent
, 2
. he doesn
' t always speak in a monotone
,
and 3
. his face doesn
' t always wear the same impassive expression
. infront short
, the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad
,
but too bad tothe be good
. unfortunately
, the same cannnot be said of his first star vehicle
, firestorm
, which is just plain awful
. one ofthe the most glaring problems wiht long
( who made his acting de
but in john woo
' s broken arrow
) is that he
' s so mediocre that he oftenly blends in with the scenery
. as ace firefighter jesse graves
, long is supposed to be playing a bigger
- than
- life action hero
-
- the kind of he
- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing tothe rescue some stupid campers
. unfortunately
, despite the best efforts of first
- time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner
' s work inthe the postman look stark
, jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy
. tothe put it kindly
, this is not a well
- writed motion picture
. firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines setted against a backdrop of disaster movie clich
? s which
, taken together
, form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot
. the onyl reason this film is getting one star
( instead of something lower
) is thast most of the fire sequences are realistic
,
and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have beeen necessary to stage them effectively
. we
' re itnroduced tothe our big burly hero one afternoon when he
and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people
. druing this sequence
, our big burly hero proves that he
' s also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl
and her dog
( yes
, the dog lives
) ffrom bieng broiled alive
. flash
- forward a year
. now
, our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association
, replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins
( real actor scott glenn
)
.
but this day
, our big burly hero
' s first in charge
, isn
' t going to be business
- as
- usual
. a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom
. led by r
andy earl shaye
( william forsythe
)
, the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die
, they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border
. allong the way
, they meet
and take hostage the damsel in distress
( suzy amis
)
. eventually
, our big burly hero is placed in a positon where he has tothe fight the fire
, rescue the damsel in distress
, defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die
,
and restore order to the galaxy
. firestorm
' s director
, dean semler
, is a former cinematographer
( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves
)
, so it
' s no surprise that the film looks good
. unfortunately
, that
' s firestorm
' s lone asset
,
and it falters near the end
, when computer
- generated special effects fill up the screen
. these are of about equal quality to what you might observe onthe a nintendo 64 video game
. the action sequences
, which include a variey of chases
, are occasionally interesting
,
but never invigorating
. everyone
, including long
, appears to be going through the motions
. there isn
' t a memorable performance tothe be found from beginning to end
, unless you count the forest fire
, which generates some heat
. as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die
, william forsythe lacks panache
. he
' s worse than a generic bad guy
; he
' s a boring generic bad guy who doesn
' t have any snappy one
- liners to hurl at our big burly hero
. my advice to scott glenn
( absolute power
) adn suzy amis
( titanic
) isnt to accientally forget this film the next time they
' re making out a resume
. there
' s some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already hvae oney entry forthe my bottom 10 list
.
( at least i hope there aren
' t 10 worse films than this
.
)
and i know i wasn
' t the only noe who really disliked this movie
. as the audience was filing out of the screening
, i loitered inaddition the theater lobby to catch a few comments
. the general consensus seemed to be that
,
al
though the movie sucked
, the promotional key ring was cool
. the problem is that fox won
' t be giving out key rings to regular movie
- goers
, so thast nixes any reason to see firestorm
.
