and
then
, reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed
. most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact
, either ogod or bad
, that infront tjhe end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings
.
but
, somtimes it cxan happen for rather trivial reasons
. i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review
. the impression left by the film wasn ' t overwhelming
- on the contrary
, there were hardly any impression at all
, since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it
. which suprise me to this day
, because the movie theatre was full
, i was close to sound speakers
, the show wasn ' t lite
and i didn ' t lack sleep before the show
. such things happen very rarely to me
,
and
, after many eyasr
, the closest thing to solution to htis mystery is probably the quality of the film itself
. the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters
- old peter brackett
( nick nolte
)
and young
, aspiring sabrina peterson
( julia roberts
)
. two of them are assigned tothe cover the train collision
. as soon as they meet
, they start scooping each other
,
but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk
,
and also the rumatic feelings they have for each other
. the plot in this film is rather secondry to its real raison d '
? tre
- rumatic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy
and katharine hepburn
. movei author
, director
and screenwriter charles shyer
, who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride
, tries again
, this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts
.
however
,
although there is some chemestry between the two
, soon it stops to arouse any interest
. it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix
, that collides light
- hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers
. shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the twpo
,
and fails in both areas
, making the story cliched
and predictable
. the end result is rather forgettable effort
, which convinced me not to watch movie again
. i ' ll give it tyhe benefit of the doubt
,
though
.
