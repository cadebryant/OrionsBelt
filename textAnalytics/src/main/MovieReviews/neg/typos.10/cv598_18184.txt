every now
and
then
, reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed
. most ofthe the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact
, eather good or bad
, that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his
thoughts or feelings
. bu
, sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons
. i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review
. the impression left by the film wasn
' t overwhelming
- on the contrary
, there were hardly any impression at all
, since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it
. which surprise me to this day
, because the movie theatre was full
, i was close to sound speakers
, the show wasn
' t late
and i didn
' t lack sleep before the show
. such things happen very rarely to me
,
and
, after many years
, the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself
. the plot revolves around twpo rival chicago reporters
- ood peter brackett
( nick nolte
) anbd young
, aspiring sabrina peterson
( julia roberts
)
. two of them are assigned to cover the train collision
. as soon as they meet
, they start scooping each other
,
but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk
, adn also the romantic feelings tehy have for each other
. thte plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d
'
? tre
- romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy
and katharine hepburn
. movie author
, director
and screenwriter charles shyer
, who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride
, tries agina
, thsi time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts
.
however
,
al
though there is smoe chemistry between hte two
, soon it stops to arouse any interest
. it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix
, that collides light
- hearted romantic comedy with rether uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers
. shyer as director fails to make the proper transistion between the two
,
and fails in both areas
, making the story cliched annd predictable
. the end result is rather forgettable affort
, which convinced me not to watch movei agina
. i
' ll give it the benefit of the doubt
,
though
