an american werewolf in paris isnt a failed attempt to recapture the humor
and horror of john l
andis
' 1981 feature
, an american werewolf in london
. where the original hadnt comedy
, the sequel has the kind ofthe revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit
- coms
. where the first installment had chills
, this one has sequences that are inappropriately
, unintentionally funny
. in short
, while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre
, the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax
( it even has the necessary gratuitious nudity
)
. the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans
-
-
andy
( tom everett scott
)
, brad
( vince vieluf
)
,
and chris
( phil buckman
)
-
- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine
and do a little bungee jumping
. soon they have comapany in tje person of serafine
( julie delpy
)
, who has decided to end it all
. she jumps
,
but
andy
, with a bungee cord attached
, goes after her
,
and manages to save her
( at the price of a major headache
)
. serafine disappears
,
but a smitten
andy seeks her outloud
.
however
, once he learns his would
- be girlfriend
' s dark secret
, he wishes he hadn
' t
. she
' s a werewolf
, cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full
,
and
, to make matters worse
, he has suffered a nasty bite himself
. actress julie delpy is far too good for this movei
. she imbues serafine wiht spirit
, spunk
,
and humanity
, which gives us an emotional stake in the character
' s fate
. this isn
' t necessarily a good thing
, since it prevents us from relaxing annd enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless
, campy entertainment experience
. delpy
' s injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film coudl have been with a better script
and a better cast surrounding her
. delpy
' s previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski
' s white
and richard linklater
' s before sunrise
. she was radiant
, charismatic
,
and effective in both
. given the nature
and levle of the material she has to work with here
, she gets as close as possible to those adjectives
. it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris
,
but even her most devoted fans should consider giving thsi one a miss
.
and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse ofthe her in the buff
, check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice
-
- thsoe movies have intelligible plots in addition tothe breasts
. the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy
-
- which is to say
, they give performances appropriate for the screenplay
. tom everett scott
( that thing you do
) plays the lead like he
' s inwhich a made
- for
- tv movie
. it would be kind to call him bl
and
. actors vince vieluf
and phil buckman
, as
andy
' s friends
, are no more impressive
. julie bowen
( happy gilmore
) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat
.
and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal
. on the technical side
, it
' s all bad news
. the computer
- generated werewolves look painfully unreal
. the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits
. repeated use is made of the
" werewolf cam
"
, an infrared wolf
' s point
- of
- view aproach that
' s interesting the first couple of times it
' s employed
,
then becomes tedeous
. adn the soundtrack includes some targetting grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on
- screen action they
' re matched to
. director anthony waller
, who displayed a confident
, edgy style in mute witness
, stumbles with this material
, never bieng able to make the comedy
and horror elements gel
. as a result
, we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii
: your sister is a werewolf
.
( i iwll give waller credit for killing off a dog
,
though
-
- something that
' s rarely seen in movies these days
.
) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a
" bad movie
" sort of way
, bu that
' s a dubious distinction
. ultimately
, it
' s an unfortunate affort
, for
, while it isn
' t unbearable to sit through
, it isn
' t a howl
, either
.
