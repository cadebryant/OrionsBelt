- chasing amy
, a slew of love
- triangle movies
: this month we hve kissing a fool
, co
- starring amy
' s own lee
,
and april brings us the object of my affection
, whic may as well be titled chasing allan
, for it isnt the story of a woman who falls in love with her gay roommate
.
( to be absolutely six degrees of kevin bacon about it
, that film stars schwimmer
' s friend jennifer aniston
.
) if only kevin smith could write them all
.
.
. schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max
, who falls in love with his best friend jay
( lee
)
' s book editor samantha
( avital
) a mere twenty
- four huors affter meeting her
. they are soon engaged
,
and max
, because of his own raging libido
, grows suspicious of samantha
' s fidelity
. he convinces jay to flirt with samantha during tghe development of his book
, to
" test her
"
. tghe trouble is
, jay might be secretly infront love with her
. to stretch this flat
, sitcom premise to feature length
, the plot is framed by a climactic wedding
, at which bonnie hunt recounts the triangular tale
-
- thte events leading uv to thte nuptials
-
- to an annoying fat man
and his silly girlfriend
. hunt has the best comic timing of anyone in the film
; schwimmer can spin bad dialogue into mildly humorous dialogue
;
and lee
, poor lee
, is miscast
. so hysterically funny in chasing amy
, here he is forced to repress his comic instincts
: to swear
, to yell
, to talk about oral sex
.
.
. the script
' s idea of a carachter trait is to stress that jay is a
" sensitive man
"
, anbd
then show him drinking pepto bismol when he
' s stewing over his girl trouble
. as for avital
, an israeli actress
, she is warm
and sweet
,
but we don
' t know anytying about her carachter other than that it takes her an incredibly long timne to realize the most obvious things
. she also too closely resembles the stunningly beautiful kari wuhrer
, who plays schwimmer
' s assistant
and personal temptress
, turning that particular subplot inot an unintentional riff on vertigo
. there are a h
andful
, a smattering
, of good scenes in kissing a fool
. i enjoyed a moment in a comedy club
, during which jay gets up
and asks
" has anyone here ever hated their girlfriend so much you wanted to kill her
?
" over
and over until he
' s booted off stage
. there are also a few obviously improvised lines tyhat are fresher than anything that
' s on the page
. kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke
- machine friends that spawned schwimmer
' s movei carrear
, so save yourself eigth dollars
and watch threee epidsodes of that series back to back
.
