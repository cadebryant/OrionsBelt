boy
, what a great movie
!
! keanu reeves
and morgan freeman acting together
, thte director of the fugitive
( andrew davis
) back agina to give us another thriller
,
and the beautyfull rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot
. how could this not be a blockbuster
? all die
- hard keanu reeves fans
, read onthe
. ol
" much ado baout nothing
" plays eddie kasalivich
, a machinist studying at the university ofthe chicago
. to help pay for the rent
, he takes onthe thsi job making the machinery forthe a hydrogen project being conducted by the university
. by happy coincidence
, he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final probelm
and thus is the only one who knows hte key to performing this feat of miricle physics
. this project holds great promise
: tkaing hydrogen from water
and giving outloud more energy tahn is put in
. a potential solution to the earth ' s energy problems without the pollution cost
. surelly nobody coudl hve any problems with that
? morgan freeman is paul shannon
, the project ' s sponsor
. he works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the publich
. he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly
. so he murders the project leader
, blows up the project
( great
bu short scene here
, sort of like a mini id4 city
- devastation thing
)
and trys to simulate the experiment at some other hi
- tech hush
- hush location
. unfortunately
, our intrepid machinist
and an english physicist
( weisz
) manage to get away
and now follows a fugitive
- like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script
. this movie is just dying for a comparison with
" the fugitive
"
. both movies use chicago as the main city
and since tje place doesn ' t change much
, i guess we can ' t really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere
. the trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford
and tommy lee jones
, chain reaction only has keanu reeves
and fred ward
. credit to them
,
but we aren ' t really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters
. where ford was able to work within the confines ofthe the movie to evoke sympathy
, eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable
anbd reeves ' character is never given the time to develope
. it might have been a better investment in film to give hte characters more depth
and spend less time on thte chase sequences
, which frankly
, get quite boring after a while
. harrison ford was
" the man against the world
.
" he was alone in a world where he didn ' t know who to trust
and it came across real well
. in chain reaction
, keanu reeves isn ' t alone
. now thast would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry
and could really portray soem paranoia
, vulnerability
and confusion
. we don ' t get this
. we get him thinking he ' s still in speed
, only nowe our sandra bullock has an english accent
, probably doesn ' t drive a bus
,
and hardly contributes anything to thge movie
. the producers here probably thought
,
" hey
, what if keanu
and rachel don ' t hit it off too well
? let ' s rope in that morgan to help us out
.
" well
, keanu
adn rachel didn ' t hit it off well on the screen
,
and most unfortunately
, morgan freeman doesn ' t help much either
. the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon isnt that he always has a full load of cigars iin his cigar holder
. it ' s not really his fault
. once again
, andrew davis just doesn ' t take the time to build his characters
. somone must have convinced him that this time round
, cinema dollars are best earned by making the movei run like a headless chicken
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
