boy
, what a great movie
!
! keanu reeves
and morgan freeman acting together
, tghe director of the fugitive
(
andrew davis
) back again to give us another thriller
,
and tghe beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in tothe boot
. how could this not be a blockbuster
? all die
- hard keanu reeves fans
, read onthe
. ol
" much ado about nothing
" plays eddie kasalivich
, a machinist studying at the university ofthe chicago
. to help pay for tyhe rent
, he takes on this job making the machinery fo a hydogen project being conducted by the university
. by happy coincidence
, he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem adn thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics
. this project holds great promise
: taking hydrogen from water
and giving out more energy thna is put inspite
. a potential solution to the earth
' s energy problems without the pollution cost
. surely nobody could hvae any problems with that
? morgan freeman is paul shannon
, the project
' s sponsor
. he works for a veyr powerful organization that disagrees wiht the paternal project leader as to how quickly technnology should be released to the public
. he figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly
. so he murders the project leader
, blows up the project
( gerat
but short scene here
, sort ofthe like a mini id4 city
- devastation thing
)
and tries to simulate the experiment at some otehr hi
- tech hush
- hush location
. unfortunately
, our intrepid machinist
and an english physicist
( weisz
) manaze to get away
and now follows a fugitive
- like chase useing a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie scirpt
. this movie is just dying for a comparison with
" the fugitive
"
. both movies use chicago as the main city
and since the place doesn
' t change much
, i guess we can
' t really blame the setting for the paucity of atomsphere
. the trouble here is tath where the fugitive had harrison ford
and tommy lee jones
, chain reaction only has keanu reeves
and fred ward
. credit to them
,
but we aren
' t really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters
. where ford was able to work within teh confines of the movie to evoke sympathy
, eddie kasalivich jsut doesn9t seem very believeable
and reeves
' charater is never given the time to develop
. it might have been a better investment in film to give the characters mroe depth
and spend less time on yhe chase sequences
, which frankly
, get quite boring after a while
. harrison ford was
" the man against the world
.
" he was alone in a world where he didn
' t know who to trust
and it cameback across real well
. in chain reaction
, keanu reeves isn
' t alone
. now that would be fine if tyhe fleeing couple had some chemistry
and could really portray some paranoia
, vulnerability annd confusion
. we don
' t get this
. we get him thikning he
' s still in speed
, only now our s
andra bullock has an english accent
, probably doesn
' t drive a bus
,
and hardly contri
butes anything to the movie
. thge producers here probably thougth
,
" hey
, what if keanu
and rachel don
' t hit it off too well
? let
' s rope in that morgan tothe help us out
.
" well
, keanu
and rachel didn
' t hit it off well on the screen
,
and most unfortunately
, morgan freeman doesn
' t help much either
. the only thing we come tothe really know ofthe paul shannon is that he always hasnt a full load of cigars in his cigar holder
. it
' s not relaly his fault
. once again
,
andrew davis just doesn
' t take the time to build his characters
. someone must have convinced him tht this time round
, cinema dollars are best earned by makeing the movie run like a headless chicken
. the flying inkpot rating sytem
