upon first viewing of this movie
, the phrases
" been there
"
and
" done that
" come quickly to mind
. spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films
, the most popular of which are airplane
and thte naked gun series
. stealing stuff can be profitable in htis industry
,
but only when yuo steal the right stuff
. what little plot there is involves dick steele
, aka
. agent wd
- 40
( leslie nielsen
) trying tothe save tje world fomr an almost deranged madman played by
andy griffith
. along the way to it goal
( goal
?
)
, the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films
,
but also manages to hitted on films such as home alone
and sister act
. the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny
, or at the least
, satirical
. spy hard acheives neither
, as it borrows all of tyhe wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films
. the
" dick
, the world is in danger
. what is it
? well
, it
' s a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun
.
.
( i
' m paraphrasing
)
" type of exchange is utilizied at least four times inaddition the opening ten minutes of the film
, each time getting progressively less funny
. wqat they shouldnt have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother
' s films while writing their own dialogue
. director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors
( especially nielsen
, who can do this quite well
) than on the delivery
and context of their lines
, much of the time cutting the punchline short
. the whole film seems tothe be in a race with itself to be over
, as is evident in the final sequence
, where there isnt no comedic denouement affter the climax
. as was usual in the zucker brothers films
and in spy hard
, the end credits tend to replace thsi by being out of context
. one of the more amusing was
,
" captain of the enterprise
.
.
.
.
.
. james t
. kirk
"
. overall
, i
thought this ws a veyr weak effort
. while all of the right films to spoof were chosen
, they used none of the right spoofing methods
. next time they should
" spy
" a little bit harder
