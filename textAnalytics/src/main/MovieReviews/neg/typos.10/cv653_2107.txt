some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch
.
then there are movies thta require you to accept thyat everyone
* inaddition
* the movie has turned off
* their
* brains
. the real mccoy is both
. it ' s charmless
, molasses
- slow
adn so full of genuinely stupid peopel that the film commission of atlanta
, where the real mccoy is setted
, might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation
. the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) being arrested in the middle of a job
. six years later
, karen is out on parole
and looking to stay straight
. she soon bumps into j
. t
. barker
( val kilmer
)
, a hapless would
- be thief who idolizes karen
. j
. t
. also has ties to jack schmidt
( terence stamp
)
, the man who blew the whistle on karen six years ealier for refusing to wrok with him
. schmidt
, who is in cahoots with karen ' s sleazy parole officer
( gailard sartain
)
, again wants karen to help him stage a robbery
. this time he has some leverage
: karen ' s kidnapped son
. just when she thought she was out
, they keep pulling her back
* in
.
* contrivances
anbd sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast
and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them
. leading the list is the jack schmidt character
, who through unexplained
bu presumably foul mains is lready extrememly wealthy when our story begins
. there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime
, let alone why he would actually participate in the break
- in
. karen ' s initial encounter with j
. t
. during a botched convenience store hold
- up also strains the limits of credibility
. it would have been simple enought to have them somehow entangled at that point
,
but instead they run into each other the next day beacuse they ' re leaving theri parole officers at exactly the smae moment
. small world
, eh
?
thne there ' s the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape
,
and pet tigers which
, through the power of hte laws of bad cinema
, must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage
.
however
, the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police
, who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day
.
but the fun doesn ' t end ther in the shambles of a script by william davies
and william osborne
. htere is also teh absence of a single
, solitary interesting character
. karen is earnest
and single
- minded in her motherly devotion
,
bu lacking any kind of edge which woudl make her a convincing criminal
,
and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material
. schmidt is a flaccid villain
, the parole officer is a complete blank
,
and karen ' s son
and ex
- husband might as well be furniture
. only kilmer ' s j
. t
. is remotely appealing
,
but his one potentially intriguing quality
, his ineptitude
, is never developed
. in fact
, kilmer disappears during the middle of the film
, jsut when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub
- plot
. i might have been more forgiving if thte pacing had been more appropiate to a caper comedy
,
but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast
. various scenes of sneaking
and skulking seem to tkae forever
,
and some end with no reason evident why they didn ' t end up onthe the cutting room floor
. even the reasonably clever climactic break
- in falls victim to this syndrome
, including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts
( i kid you not
) four minutes
. htere is no tension in the scene
, jsut tedium
. russell mulcahy
( highlander
) is a director with some style
,
and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably ogod
,
but he completely stumbles in tyhe editing room
. there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i ' m tempted to overlook the little ones
. like karen disarming one of schmidt ' s henchmen
and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing
. like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a faw moments later
. tempted
.
but i ' m pretty good at resisting temptation
