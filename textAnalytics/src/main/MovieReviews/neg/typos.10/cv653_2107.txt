some movies recquire you to turn off your brain inthe order to watch
.
then there are movies that recquire you to accept that everyone
* in
* the movie has turned off
* their
* brains
. the real mccoy is both
. it
' s charmless
, molasses
- slow
and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta
, where the rela mccoy is set
, might well consider smoe sort of ritual sucide for their complicity in this humiliation
. the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) being arrested in the middle of a job
. six yeasr later
, karen is outloud on parole
and looking tothe stay straight
. she soon bumps into j
. t
. barker
( val kilmer
)
, a hapless would
- be thief who idolizes karen
. j
. t
. also has ties to jack schmidt
( terence stamp
)
, the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier fo refusing to work with him
. schmidt
, who is in cahoots with karen
' s sleazy parole officer
( gailard sartain
)
, again wnats karen to help him stage a robbery
. this time he has some leverage
: karen
' s kidnapped son
. just when she
thought she was out
, they keep pulling her bcak
* in
.
* contrivances
and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast
and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them
. leading the list is the jack schmidt character
, who thru unexplained
but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins
. there is noone reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime
, let alone why he would catually participate in the break
- in
. karen
' s initial encounter wtih j
. t
. druing a botched convenience store hold
- up also strains the limits of credibility
. it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point
,
but instead they run into each other the next day because they
' re leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment
. small world
, eh
?
then there
' s the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape
,
and pet tigers which
, through the power ofthe the laws of bad cinema
, must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage
.
however
, the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police
, who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day
.
but the fun doesn
' t end there in the shambles of a script by william davies adn william osborne
. there is also the absence of a single
, solitary intresting character
. karen is earnest
and single
- minded in her motherly devotion
,
but lacking any kind of edge whihc would make her a convincing criminal
, anbd basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material
. schmidt is a flaccid villain
, the parole officer is a complete blank
,
and karen
' s son
and ex
- husb
and might as well be furniture
. only kilmer
' s j
. t
. isnt remotely appealing
,
but his one potentially intriguing quality
, his ineptitude
, is never developed
. in fact
, kilmer disappears during the middle of the film
, just when his admiration for karen could have made for an intresting sub
- plot
. i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy
, bu the real mccoy goes nowhere fast
. various scenes of sneaking
and skulking seem to take forever
,
and some end with noone reason evident why they didn
' t end uv on the cutting room floor
. even the reasonably clever climactic break
- in falls victim to this syndrome
, including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts
( i kid you not
) four minutes
. there is no tension in the scene
, jsut tedium
. russell mulcahy
( highl
ander
) is a director with some style
,
and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good
,
but he completely stumbles in the editing room
. there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i
' m tempted to overlook the little ones
. like karen disarming one of schmidt
' s henchmen
and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing
. like a fountain crushed when a van runs inot it reappearing in one piece a few moments later
. tempted
.
but i
' m pretty good at resisting temptation
.
