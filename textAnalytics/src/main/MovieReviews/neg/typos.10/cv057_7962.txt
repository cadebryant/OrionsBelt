supposedly based on a true story in which the british drive to build a rail bridge deep in africa grinds to a halt affter a pair of lions start killing off the workers inthe 1898
. john patterson
( val kilmer
)
, the bridge building expert set to oversee the operation
, tried to rid his operation of the lions
,
but fails
. a world renound hunter
, remington
( michael douglas
)
, is called in
and the battle
, man against lion
, begins
. htis film has a great soundtrack
,
and wonderful scenery
. the acting is not too bad except the characters are all so thin
. we only see one side of each charactor
. kilmer is a bridge builder
and that ' s all we see him as
. these lions kill dozens of his men
and he doesn ' t even appear to be too upset about it
.
and tghe plot
? it ' s jaws
,
but with lions
. again we ' re presented with an animal that behaves nto at all as it should
. it appears to kill men because it just likes too
. why
? who konws
. i guess htere wouldn ' t be much of a story if it didn ' t
. the problem is that there isn ' t much of a story even
though it does
.
