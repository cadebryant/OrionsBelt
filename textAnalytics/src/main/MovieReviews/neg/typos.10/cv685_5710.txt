steve martin shines
but sgt
. bilko fails to impress based on the populer 50
' s sitcom
, sgt
. bilko follows tghe string of old
- sitcoms
- to
- movie conversion fever
. remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back
?
( brady bunch was a moderate hit in inspite the us while hillbillies flopped
)
. i do nto really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy
,
but the tv
- conversion
- movies are hitting our screens like wildfire
, sad to say
, with mixed success
. such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there
and teh larger the following
, the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movei
. sgt
. bilko
( frankly
, i have not seen any its original tv version
)
, even with the charm
and wild antics of funnymen steve martin
and dan akroyd
; failed to entertain
. sgt
. ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool
( place of vehicle storage adn repair
) of fort baxter
.
though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of
, he has an almost superhuman ability
and zeal to sniff out money
- making opportunities
; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4
- d pools
.
though materialistic in mind
, bilko
' s methods has
thoughtfully
` enriched
' the lives of the men of fort baxter
, providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp
and the peple love him for that
. colonel hall runs the entire fort
and thanks to his inborn
` blissfully
- confused
' state
, bilko has managed to hide his operation
,
though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it
. bilko
' s state of ascent is suddenly under
- fire when thge pentagon sends major thorn
, a tough cookie on army regulations
, to check on the progress onthe the
$ 70 million hovertank project
, a new weapon under development withing the fort
' s grounds
. to add to his problems
, thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major
` sabo
' done on him by bilko durig their younger army days
. director jonathan lynn
, who directed my cousin vinny
( in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best
- supporting actress
) managed tothe pull sgt
. bilko thru with suitable pacing
and some exeptional moments of laughter
,
but that is about it
. there are really not enought laughter
- packed
- moments in sgt
. bilko to fully entertain the average movie
- goer
. still
, steve martin
' s sgt
. bilko is played with finesse
and full
- force by the renowned comedian
. without him
, sgt
. bilko owudl have just fell flat on its face
. sgt
. bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year
but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world
. the current trend in mixted successes in such tv
- conversions may be a blessing in disguise
, really
; at least it will force hollywood tothe re
- think any of its initial intentions tothe turn another tv
- idea inot a movie or at tghe very least approach those ideas with more creativity
. unless you are a fan of the tv
- serieses or love to watch steve martin in action
, yuo can skip this oen when deciding which movie tothe catch in tje local theatres
. i
' m sure there are better ones around
.
