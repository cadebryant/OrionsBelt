in this year
' s summer movie preview issue of
_ entertainment
_ weekly
_
, theresa connelly described her writing
- directing de
but
,
_ polish
_ wedding
_
, as
" a child that did nto quite become the child i
thought it would
.
" one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film
, a comedy
- drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements
. the family at the center of
_ polish
_ wedding
_ is the pzoniaks
, which consists of mother jadzia
( lena olin
)
, father bolek
( gabriel byrne
)
, sole daughter hala
( claire danes
)
and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness
. it
' s a large family
,
but there
' s nto a sympathetic one in the whole bunch
, certainly not in the primary trio
. jadzia tkaes pride in building
and maintaining a home
and family
, bu she
' s kind of a hypocrite since she
' s carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija
)
. her excuse for her affair is neglect ffrom bolek
, who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness
and frustration
. also
, how could he possibly pay so little attention tothe the saucy
, sexy jadzia
? hala is a spoiled
, self
- centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy
. with such an unappealing setted of characters
, it
' s no surprise that
_ polish
_ wedding
_
' s plot complications are far ffrom involving
. naturally
, jadzia
and bolek would like hala tothe marry tjhe young cop
, russell schuster
( adam trese
)
, who fathered the child
, bu he refuses tothe make such a commitment
. ho
- hum
. another complication
, involving the decidely un
- virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary
, is first played for laughs
and
then
, inexplicably
, as a profound statement in the film
' s climax
-
- which
, ironicly
, isnt funnier than any of the film
' s lame attemts at humor
, such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell
. that scene is
but one in a number of wirting miscues by connelly
. the jadzia
- bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers
. the hala
- russell conflict isn
' t resolved in as contrived a manner
, bu their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something
.
and
then there
' s some atrocious dialogue
, which i am sure wass nto supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound
:
" look at all these pickles
. just looking at them gives me such great sadness
.
" as misguided as
_ polish
_ wedding
_ is
, thge affair is something of a letdown
, considering the strong performances by byrne
, danes
,
and especially the fiery olin
. they obviously believed in connelly
and her material
-
- a faith that audiences iwll be hard
- pressed to share
.
