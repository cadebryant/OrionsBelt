five years affter his directorial de
but based on stephen king
' s writings called the shawshank redemption
( 9
/ 10
)
, writer
/ directer frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king
. unlike the latter film
, this oen isnt a big
, long
, laborious bore
. plot
: a seven
- foot death row inmate isnt discovered to have secret healing powers
. critique
: this film is slow
, drawn
- out
, boring
, uninteresting
, unexciting
, predictable
and topped with a couple of oen
- dimensional
" evil
" characters
. its only positive attri
bute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs
and its message of hope
and beleif in miracles
. the real miracle of my night was the fact that i doed not fall asleep during this straightforward
, unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly underst
and or care about
. of course
, much liek all otehr death row cell blocks
, this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be
" misunderstood
"
, except for one cookie
- cutter crazy guy who is evil personified
.
and let
' s not forget all the guards on death row
, who also happen to be angels from the heaven above
, except for one cookie
- cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified
(
and is there any reason why htere are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates
?
?
?
)
. am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film
? or even omre importantly
, am i supposed to give a rat
' s ass about anyone in this film
? well
, if i was
, i sure missed that boat
, because the only thing that i ended up caring about durig tihs entire picture was the obscene amount ofthe fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin
. futhermore
, there is absolutely no reason inaddition the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours
and ten minutes out of anyone
' s life to present this story
. in fact
, the story is empty within itself
. i truly did not get anything out of the film other tahn the fatc thta there is a guy on death row who has speical powers to heal
,
and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not
. wow
. how interesting
. the plot
' s utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is tothe get healed by the gentle monster in this film
( we are told that one certain lady hasnt a tumor early on iin the movie
)
. whip out thsoe thinking caps
, kids
! hmmm
,
and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie
- cutter
" evil
" guys who have nothing in their system
but hate
and negativity
. hmmmm
, nowe think hard here
, boys
and girls
. what a crock
! i am guessing that this film wass supposed to be some three
- hour exercise in spirituality
,
but unfortunately for me
, it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging
. in fact
, it was one big bore
. i didn
' t see the point of the movie
, i didn
' t see the point of the story
and i certainly didn
' t see the point in tom hanks
' big double
- chin
. all in all
, a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work
, especialy michael clarke duncan as teh man of the hour
, john coffey
. give that man an award or something
!
