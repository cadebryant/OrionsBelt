spoiled rich kid kelley morse
( chris klein
) receives a new mercedes for a graduation present
. he anbd his buddies take it for a joyride to a small nearby town
, where he proceeds to torment the locals simply becouse he
' s rich
and they
' re not
. he ends up provoking jasper
( josh hartnett
) into a race
and as a result
, the local gas station
and diner are destroyed when they crash into it
. kelley isnt sentenced to rebuild the diner
,
and has to live with jasper in a spare room over his family
' s barn
. jasper
' s girlfriend sam
( leelee sobieski
) soon takes a liking to kelley
however
, despite the fact thgat 1
) it was her family
' s diner that was destroyed
and b
) all kelley does is sit around
, sulk
,
and smart off to the townspeople
. bu when she sees him sweaty
and shirtless
, that
' s apparently all she needs to lose her feelings for jasper
( whose only fault seems tothe be a perpetual case of hat hair
)
. so sobieski soon falls in love withthe kelley
, especially affter the day she follows him through the woods
and hears him giving his graduation speek
( which he was unable to deliver because he caused the destruction of property
and nearly killed dozens of people
)
. in the speech
, kelley quotes a poem by robert frost
, which just so happens to be sam
' s favorite poem as well
. awwwww
. soon they
' re frolicking around in the fields
and for some reason waste no time letting people in town
( especially jasper
' s best friend
) see them together
. kelley continues to make an ass of himself in town
, especially when he shows up at the town dance
, drunk
and steaming because sam went with jasper
. kelley runs off
and decides to leave town
. sam catches up to him at the bus station
and he asks her to come to boston iwth him
. jasper shows up
and tearfully confesses to sam jstu how much he loves her
,
and sam
, without even breaking stride basically says
" see ya
!
"
and takes off to boston with kelley
. here on earth goes in so many wrong directions from the start that by the time its fairly decent ending comes around
, its completely worthless
. chris klein
and leelee sobieski are two of my current favorite young performers
,
and it
' s because ofthe their presence that i watched this film in tjhe first place
. howver
, not long into the proceedings i wanted to just reach into the film
and strangle them both
. i shouldn
' t have such feelings towards people i like
,
but their characters are so infuriating that
.
.
. well trust me
, you
' ll feel the same way
. even
though both of the lead male characters are usually in the wrong
, kelley is h
ands down the mroe unlikable of the twpo
, simply because his jerkish actions are calculated
. he intends to be a jackass each
and every time he does it
. jasper on the other h
and
, only reacts to kelley
' s provocations
,
and afterwards comes acros as being truly sorry for his impulsive actions
.
but
, as in life
, nice guys finish last
. for the entire film we watch sam fall in love with the guy no one likes while the film
' s onyl sympathetic character gets completly crushed
.
then
, a cancer subplot comes into play
( where things git even more infuriating
, if you can imagine that
)
. what
, things weren
' t depressing enough for ytou mr
. screenwriter
? who greenlit this project
? who
" on earth
"
thought this would entertain anyone
? perhaps if the film had been structured where kelley perhaps feeled some remorse after he caused the destruction of property
and nearly killed dozens of people
.
but even after he
' s destroyed these people
' s lives he continues to be a snob to them
,
and ruins one mroe for good measure
. here on earth is available on dvd from fox home entertainment
. it containes the film infront its original theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions
. extras inlcude jessica simpson
' s music video for
" where ytou are
"
, a commercial for the film
' s soundtrack
( which by the way isnt tghe only ogod thing about the film
)
, the originnal theatrical trailer
and five tv spots
, trailers for other fox releases
( anna
and the king
, anywhere
but here
, the beach
, drive me crazy
, ever affter
, romeo
+ juliet
, simply irresistible
)
, as well as that new fox promo touting their upcoming dvd releases that i realy enjoy
. the picture annd sound quality on the disc are fine
.
.
. nothing that will challenge anyone
' s audio
/ video systems of course
. fans of this movie
( if any exist
) should enjoy the dvd realease
. here on earth is not intertaining nor is it compelling
. no joy or enteratinment value can be derived from any ofthe the events of the film
. it is merely a waste of time
, money
and talent
.
