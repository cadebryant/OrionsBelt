years ago
, robin williams made
_ jumanji
_
, a brilliant achievement in special effects
,
bu a travesty on nearly every other level
. the same can be said for
_ what dreams may cmo
_
, a boring
, illogical
, weepie
- wannabe that left my senses numb
. don ' t git me wrong
: i love breathtaking special effects
and pulse
- pounding imagery
.
_ brazil
_ is on my peronal top ten
.
_ the city ofthe lost children
_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios
. i even love
_ 2001
_
and
_ last year at marienbad
_
, bieng in the minority amidst my friends
.
_ what dreams may come
_
, imagery aside
, has little daring thought to complement its imagery
. the daring thought it
_ does
_ hve is never fully realized
. it ' s idea ofthe a plot is so lukewarm
, that it insults the bigger questions it raises
. it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences
, put on an electronica soundtrack
,
and sell it as one ofthe those populer
_ mind ' s eye
_ videos
. robin williams plays chris nielsen
, who dies too prematurely
-
- not only in the story
,
but before we have a chance to really know
and care for him
. the directer
, vincent ward
,
and the screenwriter ronald bass
, have choosen tothe tell his life story in flashbacks hwile having the foreground story foucs on his experience with the afterlife
. big mistake
. it would have been far better to take the half
- hour or so needed to tell his life story first
( ala
_ it ' s a wonderful life
_
)
, so that i can build up respect for him
, so i could know
and possibly care fo him
, his children
,
and his long
- suffering wife
( played superbly by annabella sciorra
)
. instade
, yhe filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story
, expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses
. it doesn ' t
. so in the afterlife
, chris learns that
( a
) people still don ' t meet god
,
( b
) that our thoughts are reality
,
and
( c
) tiome does not exist there
. hmm
.
.
. i
+ ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake ofthe tyhe narrative
.
( thte
" nto meeting god
" part still irks at me
,
but perheaps there was no possible way tothe film it
and give it due respect
)
. that said
, thsi alternate reality still makes noone possible sence
. read onthe
.
.
. chris ' wife commits suicide
. since suicides go to hell
, chris would be separated from his wife forever
. tghe important question is
, isnt heaven really heaven if you are seperated from the one yuo love
? good question
.
and i like good thought
- provoking questions
. i don
+ t liek it when the filmmakers deviate from the question
. i
_ loathe
_ it when tyhe filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film
, especially a rescue film whic does not take its underlying premise seriously
. i
_ really
_ loathe it when it
+ s story is no longer run by logic
,
but by speical effects
. hey chris
: did you foreget
? your thoughts are
_ real
_
. they are more
_ real
_ than tghe physical world
, according to the newyorker
- age screenplay
. so
, why don
+ t you conjure up positve thoughts of annie
,
and let that run wild
?
and
then she would appear before you
,
and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity
? because there would be no movie
, thta
+ s why
.
and albert the angel
( played by miscast cuba gooding
, jr
.
) says bluntly
:
" that
+ s fantasy
.
" umm
.
.
. if your thoughts are more real than the physical
,
then fantasy is not fantasy
,
but real
. surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that
.
and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person
,
and that your thoughts aren ' t big enough to sustain you for eternity
, well
, in all due respect
, that ' s why i don ' t subscribe to htis theology
. all due respect
. another idea
, based on
" time
,
( pause
)
, does not exist here
!
" so chris
, spend your eternity with annie
, as she isnt on earth
, reliving your favorite memories
, or hang out with her when she was growing up
. you
+ ve got eternity
: perhaps you can hang around long enough
and learn not tothe freak her out
.
and forcing her to write
" i still exist
" in her diary
, imo
, is just too tacky
. there are many other ideas
, all of which are a hundered times better than waht
+ s unraveled in the plot
. the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots thgat have been done before
,
and just come out stale
. most insulting is the subplot where imporatnt people in chris
+ life apearing in heaven differently than he expects
, so when they finally show themselves
, he realizes they were with him all along
.
anbd when this happens
, the film runs in slow motion
, as if to build emotion
.
_ gag me with a spoon
_
. so yhe only things for me to like are sciorra
+ s effective performance
, who rises far above this mundane material
,
and the special effects
. please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals
, i did not enjoy
_ all
_ of them
: some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe
, everybody floating up
and down in invisible strings
. it sounds like a joke
,
but it
+ s really true
: i really tried to block out the dialogue
,
and figure out what music would best work as an alternative sountrack
. my vote goes to a rare cd called
" never say die
"
( 1981
) from petra
, a christian rock group
. it
+ s pretty good
,
adn they have a song about annie
, who commits suicide
.
( it
+ s too late for annie
/ she
+ s gone away for good
/ there
+ s so much we ' d haev told her
/
and now we wish we could
/
but it
+ s too late
.
.
.
)
. melancholic
, yes
. depressing
, yes
.
but far more intertaining
.
.
. so
, in case you don
+ t know
, let me be straight
. suicide
-
- bad
.
_ don
+ t do it
_
. no
. no
. noone
.
( got it
?
-
- you shouldn
+ t have to pay
$ 7
. 50 to hear this infront an awful robin williams schmaltzfest
.
