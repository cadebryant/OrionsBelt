plot
: a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth
, oops
.
.
. i mean
, an evil man
. he vows revenge on that man
and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used tothe be one himself
? anyway
, fourteen years go by
and
.
.
. arrgh
, well
, you know the rest
.
.
. swish
- swish
- zzzzzzz
! critique
: this is a preety bad movie
. let ' s see
, where should i start
? okay
, first of all
, the story is just plain boring
. it ' s not original
, is entirely predictable
and lacks energy
. okay
, what ' s next
? acting
, you say
. hmmmm
, well
, the main actro
, justin chambers
, is basically an uncharismatic version of chris o ' donnell
but with less range
( htink about that
!
)
,
and mena suvari
, is just plain off
. nto as bad as thora birch was in dungeons
& dragons
,
but entirely miscast
, with bad deliveries
, awful sequences
and a piss
- poor accent tath comes
and goes
. now i ' m not sure if htis was ms
. suvari ' s fault or the director ' s
,
but i ' ve definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film
. tyhe only semi
- saving grace acotr
- wise isnt tim roth as the irrepressible
" bad guy
"
,
bu once again
, it ' s not something that we haven ' t seen before
.
.
. a thousand times
.
.
. by tjhe same guy
!
! tim
, please
.
.
. for the lvoe of god
, beg your agent tothe ask the marketplace fo some modern day
" american roles
" for you as a
" nice guy
" in a rumatic comedy or something
. stretch
, dude
.
.
. stretch
!
! we all know that ytou can do much better than this gunk
. alright
, what else was bad in this film
? oh yeah
, the score
! yikes
, how ' s about taking it down a few notches there
, fellas
? this thing blares in your ear whenever it feels the need to accentuate a certain scene
,
but accually does little more than annoy
. i think it ' s important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn ' t a
" rela epic
" by any strech of the imagination
. it ' s a fluffy rehashed cake
- walk created by some
" shrewd
" studio heads who decided to take advantage of the whole
" kung
- fu
" phenomenon in films
,
and test it out on an old classic
. dudes
.
.
. you failed all around
!
( keep reading
) the editing is also preety shoddy in this movie
, tje dialogue banal
and stilted
and the plot problems
.
.
. plentiful
!
( why does the guy onthe top of the horse carriage just stand there when his opponent tkaes forever scampering his way back to the top
? why don ' t they just cut yhe mouseketeer ' s rope at the top of the tower
, instead of jumping down on their own chords
and fighting him while hanging
? why doesn ' t anybody look a day older
, when the sequence says
" 14 years later
"
?
( at least
.
.
. change your shirt
, man
!
) keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing ceratin movies that are created simpley fo the sake of a
" fun time
"
,
but this flick just didn ' t cut it for me
. it was boring for stretches
, the acting was atrocious at times
( the
" romantic
" scene between suvari
and chambers next to tje lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe
)
, there was little reason to care for anyone
and since when weere the musketeers fat
? i will give the movie this much
,
and that is tyhat its main reason for being
( its
" raison
- d ' etre
"
, as the french would say
)
, its fight sequences
, do come through despite the lack of their numbers in the film
. i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer
,
but what you see there
, are essentially the snippets from the two major
(
and cool
) swashbuckling sequences from tyhe film
. the first comes right at the beginning of the movie
, while the otehr essentially finishes the film off
, hanging from thge tower
and juggling off ladders
. the ladder sequence itself is a definite keeper
but unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap
.
and can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film ' s credits
? hullo
? the film is called the musketeer
and stars a dude name justin chambers
. deneuve is bearly in this movie
! ugh
, just another small thing that annoyed me about thsi trash
. now say it together
, gang
:
" all for one
,
and oen for all
.
.
. we vow to stay away from it all
!
!
" thank me later
