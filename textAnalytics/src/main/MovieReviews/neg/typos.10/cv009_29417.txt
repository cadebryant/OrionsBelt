plot
: a young french boy sees his parents killed before his eyes by tim roth
, oops
.
.
. i mean
, an evil man
. he vows revenge on that man
and is taught the ways of the musketeer by some old dude who used to be one himself
? anyway
, fourteen years go by
and
.
.
. arrgh
, well
, you know the rest
.
.
. swish
- swish
- zzzzzzz
! critique
: this is a pretty bad movie
. let
' s see
, where should i start
? okay
, first of all
, tyhe story is just plain boring
. it
' s not original
, is entirely predictable
and lacks energy
. okay
, what
' s next
? acting
, you say
. hmmmm
, well
, the main actor
, justin chambers
, isnt basicaly an uncharismatic version of chris o
' donnell
but with less range
( think about that
!
)
,
and mena suvari
, is just plain off
. nto as bad as thora birch was in dungeons
& dragons
,
but entirely miscast
, with bad deliveries
, awful sequences adn a piss
- poor accent tyhat comes
and goes
. now i
' m not sure if this was ms
. suvari
' s fault or the directer
' s
,
but i
' ve definitely seen her at a much higher level than in this film
. the only semi
- saving grace atcor
- wise is tim roth as the irrepressible
" bad guy
"
, bu once again
, it
' s not something that we haven
' t seen before
.
.
. a thous
and times
.
.
. by the same guy
!
! tim
, please
.
.
. for the love of god
, beg your agent to ask the marketplace for some modern day
" american roles
" for you as a
" nice guy
" in a romantic comedy or something
. stretch
, dude
.
.
. stretch
!
! we all know thyat ytou can do much better than this gunk
. alright
, what else was bad in this film
? oh yeah
, the score
! yikes
, how
' s about taking it down a few notches there
, fellas
? this thing blares in your ear whenever it fiels the need to accentuate a certian scene
,
but actually does little more than annoy
. i think it
' s important for the man behind the music to recognize that this film isn
' t a
" real epic
" by any stretch ofthe the imagination
. it
' s a fluffy rehashed cake
- walk created by soem
" shrewd
" studio heads who decided tothe take advantage of the whole
" kung
- fu
" phenomenon in films
,
and test it out on an old classic
. dudes
.
.
. you failed all around
!
( keep reading
) the editing is also pretty shoddy in this movie
, the dialogue banal
and stilted
and the plot problems
.
.
. plentiful
!
( why does tje guy on top of the horse carriage just st
and there when his opponent takes forever scampering his way back to the top
? why don
' t they just cut tjhe mouseketeer
' s rope at the top of the tower
, instade of jumping down on their pwn chords anbd fighting him while hanging
? why doesn
' t anybody look a day older
, when the sequence says
" 14 years later
"
?
( at least
.
.
. change your shirt
, man
!
) keep in mind that i have never strayed away from championing certain movies that are created simply for the sake of a
" fun time
"
,
but thsi flick just didn
' t cut it for me
. it was boring forthe stretches
, the acting was atrocious at times
( the
" romantic
" scene between suvari
and chambers next tothe the lake reminded me of plays in high school which made you cringe
)
, there was little reason to care for anyone
and since when were tje musketeers fat
? i will give the movei this much
, annd that is that its main reason for being
( its
" raison
- d
' etre
"
, as the french would say
)
, its fight sequences
, do come thru despite the lack of their numbers infront the film
. i was hoping that the movie would be packed with cool stuntwork as promoted in its trailer
,
but what you see there
, are essentially the snippets from the two major
(
and cool
) swashbuckling sequences from the film
. the first comes right at the beginning ofthe the movei
, while the otehr essentially finishes the film off
, hanging from the tower
and juggling off ladders
. the ladder sequence itself is a deffinite keeper bu unfortunately the rest of the movie is just regurgitated crap
. adn can anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her name placed at the top of this film
' s credits
? hullo
? the film is called hte musketeer
and stars a dude name justin chambers
. deneuve is barely in this movie
! ugh
, just another small thing that annoyed me about this trash
. now sday it together
, gang
:
" all fo one
,
and one for all
.
.
. we vow to stay away from it all
!
!
" thank me later
. where
' s joblo coming from
? a knight
