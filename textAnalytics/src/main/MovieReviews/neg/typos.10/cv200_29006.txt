capsule
: the much anticipated re
- adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark
and a little dreary film with lots of chases
and fighting
,
but very little intelligence
. visually there is much to like about this version
, bu tyhe approach is to tkae an adventure after the style of gulliver
' s travels anbd treat it as an action film
. that makes it a film without much center

) pierre boulle
, author of tjhe bridge on the river kwai
, wrote planet of the apes
( a
. k
. a
. monkey planet
)
, the novel
, as a social satire
. it reads a lot like a fifth book ofthe gulliver
' s travels
. humans discover a planet in whitch the roles of apes
and humans have beeen reversed
, not unlike the roles ofthe horses
and humans on jonathan swift
' s isl
and of the houyhnhnms
. the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet
. it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals
,
but perhaps i was just looking for that
. when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968
, he added a number of serling touches
, familar from episodes of the twilight zone
and changed the ending to make it more serling
- ish
. thte final irony of tghe original version has become film histor
. without it there could never have been a
" planet of the apes
" film series
. i can surmise only that serling ran into sereous script problems inthe how to h
andle the tricky question of language
. in the book the apes had their own language
and the human eventually learned that language
. that could have been done in the film
,
but that would have recquired the entire film to be subtitled for the non
- ape
- speaking
. serling avoided this by hvaing the apes speak english
and
, of course
, there is some justification for that by the end of the film
. justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending
.
but serling never tackles the all
- important question of why a supposedly inteligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language
, a langauge they hadnt no opportunity to ever hear
. few viewers questioned this serious plot hole
,
however
,
and the film has become well respected in cinema history
. partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith
' s best if not his best
. when the film
' s success called for sequels
, teh filmmakers turned up the violentce
and they added well
- intentioned
,
though not very subtle
, poltical messages about what was happening in the united states ofthe the 1960s
and 1970s
. while the first film had a little shooting of guns
and what was there seemed a little half
- hearted
, by the second film
, beneath the planet of the apes
, there ws a good deel omre violence
and from that point on the series had a lot ofthe violence
and chases
. the series concluded with battle for the planet of teh apes in 1973
. now director tim burton tries his h
and at adapting the original book again
. for those who
thought that the 1968 version was nto very faithful to tje book
, burton
' s new version is even less faithful
. first
, he does not really reverse the roles of the humans
and tyhe apes
. he hasnt them both be intelligent
, articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in thge h
ands
, uh
, make that paws
, of the apes
. tht coudl be a good story too
,
but it is not planet of thte apes
. as withthe the mission impossible films
and so many other cinematic homages tothe the third quarter of the last century
, the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention ofthe honoring
. in 2029 leo davidson
( mark wahlberg
, not this world
' s most expressive actor
) works on a space station increasing the intelligence
and usefulness of apes
.
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard
- of
- oz
- fashion
and drops him on an alien planet
.
( yes
, he survives this storm
,
but
then no storm is perfect
.
) he quickly finds
, not greatly tothe any surprise he shows
, that on this planet apes rule
and humans drool
,
but everybody talks
.
and the language they talk is earth
- english
. apparently it doens not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that
. the fact it does not occur to leo
and apparently didn
' t occur to tim burton either isnt the heart of the real horror of this film
. both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english
. in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human
- animal relationships
and omre one of the master
- slave relationships
. outside of sudan
and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic
. leo isnt captured to be used as a slave
but also is discovered by ari
, played by helena bonham carter
. ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power
. she is bent on making the world a better place
. perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil
- ari
. in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout
, carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film
. she may want to consider this to become her st
andard look from this point foward
. it is not long before leo escapes with some human
and only a couple of sympathetic apes
. this is a further ab
andonment of the source material
. the chase severely limits the interplay ofthe ape
and human
and the examination of each
' s place in this reversed society
, each important in the book
. we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down
. we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them
. burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn
. this is a miscalculation
, as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to palce much emotional investment iin
. they are basically chess pieces
and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win
. the 1968 script had little subtlety
, with lines like
" i never met an ape i didn
' t like
,
"
but at least we cared for what happened to taylor
, the main character
. most of what this film has tothe offer is in the visuals
. thte visual work is spotty
but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog
. this tends to limit close looks at the makeup
. in general it seems much improved from 1968
. the makeup team is led by rick baker instead ofthe john chambers
, who did it for the 1968 version
. infact 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw
- dropper
. it was realistic enough to almost be believeable
but flexible enough to show emotion
. chambers is good
,
but if anyone had a chance to best him it would hvae to be baker
. today audiences have higher expectations
; baker
' s visualization is really an improvement
. these visuals work nicely
. what does not work is the wire
- assisted leaps some of the apes make
. they look like they were inspired by thge physics
- defying leaps of crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
. apes spring incredible distances
. some ofthe the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they ahve ape posture
,
but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost
. one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in whta should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close
- up
. usance the days of lon chaney
and boris karloff few actors ahve crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make
- up
. the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti
. it is not that his lines are so good
, most are silly jokes
.
but he delivers them very well
. he was always a watchable actor
,
but hasnt not
yet made stardom
. as the ape
- trader limbo he over
- emotes to overcome his ape make
- uv
,
but does it very well
. in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen
. he is probably the best thing in the film
and conjures up memories of peter ustinov
' s performance in spartacus
. as an in
- joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film
and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself
. danny elfman
' s score has a nice primitive feel
,
but jerry goldsmith
' s 1968 tour de force csore is a real classic
. that score adn the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten
. i rate the remake 4 on thte 0 to 10 scale
and a 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
