the happy bastard ' s quick movie review holy man more liuke holy crap
. the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical
- ish figure named g on a strange journey of soem sort when he comes across two network execs
( jeff goldblum
and kelly preston
) with a flat tire on their hands
. somehow he ends up in their car
and on their channel
, a line
- up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white
, morgan fairchild
,
and a slew ofthe other celebrities
and nameless figures
. it ' s here that he seems to hitted his stride
, speaking of life instead
and somehow boosting sales
. at this point in yhe movie
, of course
, morality comes into play
, particularly on goldblum
, who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get inwhich good with his boss
( robert loggia
)
. it doesn ' t take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush
, iwth realizations tkaing place left
and right
and poor plot points
. only a rela zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild ' s face seems to have any interest in the movei
. murphy lends nothing to his character
and poor goldblum looks as if he ' d rather be someplace else
. some may argue that the movie has a message
,
but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat
. at least he has something for us to laught at
.
