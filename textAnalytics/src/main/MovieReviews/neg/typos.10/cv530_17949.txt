these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself inthe the deluge of remakes
.
but
, only a faw years ago
, before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice
, sequels hadnt been more populer among hollywood producers
. sequels also used to be populare among directors
annd movie stars whose careers went south
. the way to regain popularity
and prestige
, they thought
, ws the use the same formulas
, characters
and story lines that brought them success in the firt place
. one of such celebrity was eddie murphy
, black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline druing the first part of this decade
. in order to return to the spotlight
, he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film
, beverly hills cop
, 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987
. seven years later
, for the third instalment
, he used the directorial sevice of john landis
, another fading star
, with whom he successfully collaborated twice
- in trading places
annd coming to america
. this time
,
however
, third time wasn ' t the charm
and beverly hills iii was failure
. eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback
. eddie murphy here plays axel foley
, fast
- talking streetwise detroit policeman
, who raids illegal chop shop
. the routine police action ends in tragedy
, when the criminals kill foley ' s boss
. determined tothe bring the killers to justice
, foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald
( timothy carhart
)
. when it turns out that de wald happens to be security cheif for wonderland theme park in los angeles
, foley goes back tothe los angeles
. there
, wiht the help of his old friend
, local policeman rosewood
( judge rheinhold
)
, foley woudl clash with money counterfeit ring
. ten years has passed since tje original
anbd times are definitely different
. in thsi decade
, the contrast between blue collar detroit
and yuppie beverly hills
, which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film
, simply doesn ' t work
. screenwrighter steven e
. de souza provides another conflict
, this time between tghe childish sillyness of the good guys
and business
- like professionalism ofthe the bad guys
. since foley belongs to the former
, his character had to watch his language
,
and yhe tone of the film in general is mroe infantile
. unfortunately
, this film still belongs tothe action movie genre
,
annd there is too much violentce for little children
. nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning
, which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath
. unlike donner with tjhe lethal weapon series
, landis simpley can ' t balance the comedy with
" regular
" acation
,
adn the result is a film that fails in both aspects
. action scenes are sometimes interesting
,
but not too spectacular
( at the end
, scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself
)
; humour
, on the other hand
, falls flat
. to make even worse
, some minor charachters ffrom 1984 film gets unnecessary
and sometimes irritating overexposure
( especially art expert turned inot arms dealer
, played by bronson pinchot
)
. in the end
,
although the film provided some enteratinment
, viewers
, at least critical ones
, would probably be happy to know that there aren ' t any plans for beverly hills iv
.
