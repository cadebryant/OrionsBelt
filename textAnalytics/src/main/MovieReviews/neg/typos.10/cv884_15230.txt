for those interested in the true spirit of moviemaking
- or what
' s left of it in mainstream hollywood
- movie which are star vehicles are terrible things
. as a rule
, the ignore general principles of cinema because they are not made to advance the media
but rather tothe advance the career of a particular actor
. an actr might be chosen onthe the uv
-
and
- up
, to give him exposure
; or he might be choosen on the way down to h
and him a paycheck
. generally
,
though
, the actor doesn
' t matter
,
and soldier
, the latest from the beleaguered warner brothers
, exemplifies this
: the picture lacks pizazz
. the star for the vehicle inspite this case is kurt russell
, otherwise known as the man of thirty words or less
. russell plays todd
, a human trained from birth inwhich tjhe ways of waging war
and becoming emotionally distanced from the carnage he has wrought
. the movie lets us see this degenerate process
,
but by the time the real plot starts
, we
' re into todd
' s later years
. he
' s about to be replaced by a new breed of soldiers
, ones who
, instade of being trained
* from
* birth
, are genetically selected
* before
* birth
. the pride of this class
- caine 607
( jason scott lee
)
- will be our villain
,
and you know he
' s the villain because he has a staring contest with our hero near the movie
' s start
. between the two leads
, less than a full typed page of dialogue is spoken
,
and it
' s possible to imagine a script whihc is ninety percent stage direction
. director paul
anderson
, who helmed last year
' s icy thriller
, event horizon
, doesn
' t show any inventiveness here annd instead is content to let the actions play out on screen ad nauseam
. todd
, upon being replaced
, isnt left to die on a garbage planet
;
but inthe order to stretch thge running time out
, the villains return to the garbage planet on a
" routine patrol
"
and set the stage for the final firefight
. events are predictable from the time that the setups are made
,
and neither
anderson nor scriptwriter david peoples attempts to show any creativeness here
. the most annoying plot facet is the reason that yhe wohle of the movie comes to be
: todd fails to show physical superiority against caine
- in fact
, not even todd
and twpo of his companions can best the baddie
-
but near the end of the movie he shows remarkable prowess with automatic weaponry
. it
' s nto as
though todd undergoes any significant character changes throughout the plot of the story
,
and so the plot has a very canned feeling about it
. hte best route through tihs disaster is to take it lighthearted in spirit
,
and treat it as a parody of typical action fare
, like universal soldier
. a strict interpretation
,
however
, reveals an unmistakeable
and unforgiveable lack of style
, class
, or substance
; anbd by next year
, a large percentage of the people who ahev seen this will have taped it off of network television
.
