bad
. bad
. bad
. that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls
. if that summary isn
' t enough for you
, how about t
& a
, t
& a
, t
& a
? still haven
' t got the point
? other than director russ meyer
' s predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore
- mentioned anatomical areas
, there is really only one other reason to recommend even tkaing a look at this movie
. that is thte fact that it was co
- written by famed film critic roger ebert
, who also was responsible for the screenplay
. after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movei a thumbs down fo bad writing with a straight face
. thsi movie stinks out loud
. quite frankly
, this movie deserves a
.
but there are parts ofthe it that are so bad they are almost funny
. so i
' m giving it a
.
and maybe that is too generous
. right from the opening credits
, i knew that i had a class
- a bomb onthe my h
ands
. not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting
,
but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform
. i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening
( it does get explained later
)
and as soon as the first scene is over
, we cut to a completely unrelated scene
. tothe be honest
, as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was
, i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film
. with the qualiyt of the writing during the rest of tje film
, it wouldn
' t have surprised me if tje opening hadnt never beeen explained
. so what isnt this movie about
? yuo ask
. liek it relaly matters
. ok
, here goes
. htis all
- girl b
and headed by kelly macnamara
( dolly reed
)
and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry
. once there
, they do manage to find success
( due as much to their hooters as anything else
? it sure wasn
' t for their brutally bad singing voices
)
,
and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame git to them
. everyting from big egos
, to booze
and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral
. there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure
,
but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this hting
.
> from a creative st
andpoint there is nothing redeeming here
. other than the above
- maintioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have
. the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts
. mr
. ebert hasnt generously thrown in helpings of
" hey man
"
,
" dig
" annd my all time favorite
-
-
" this isnt my happening
, annd it freaks me out
"
. now i ask you
, with lines like that how can yuo go wrong
? ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue
. maybe he
thought it would make the movie seem smarter
. i don
' t know
,
but all the big words in tjhe world wouldn
' t be able to disguise the bad writing
and even worse acting
.
but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie
. i
' ve seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey
. in fact
, there is one scene
-
- the one in which they are in a van driving tothe hollywood to make their fortunes
-
- during which i realyl had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries
. add to hte directing
and writing the music in this movie
. i almost got uv to check my sound system to see if it was broken
, there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers
.
then we have the cast
. frist lets start david gurian who played harris
, the manager of the b
and
. this has got tothe be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera
. sadly
, his acting doesn
' t come close to making up for his looks
. if you have been following along up to this point
, this shouldn
' t surprise you
. meyer
' s stable of well endowed girls also have tjhe benefit of being fairly attractive tothe go along with their other assets
. dolly reed plays kelly
, the leader of the b
and
.
and no surprise here
, she was cast forthe her cup size
, nto her talents
.
and yes
, she does loose the shirt a few times
and display her impressive talents
. sadly
, her ass is almost as large as her chest
. hey
, it a sexist movie
, so i
' m writing a sexist review
.
then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey
, one of the other b
and members
. this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie
. meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for
and who obviously has no acting talent at all
,
but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all
. sure russ
, now is the time to get artsy
and throw in some well placed shadows
. on the uv side
, she doens have a fun lesbo scene
. i sound like i
' m writing a review in a porn magazine
.
but hey
, i
' ll admit it
; teh only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked
.
and since that wass a huge disappointment
, i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey
. the onyl thing that i can sday baout this movie is that you should stay away from it
. unless of course ytou want tothe feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too
. annd if you are thinking of checking it out for the doulbe d
' s
-
- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet
. this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs
. an even better idae might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box ofthe beyond the valley of the dolls
-
- beware
: thsi movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense
. proceed with extreme caution
