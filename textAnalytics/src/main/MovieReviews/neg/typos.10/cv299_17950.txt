8mm
, written by seven scribe
andrew kevin walker
, has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog st
andard murder mystery
. nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles
, who is asked by upper class toff mrs
. christian
( myra carter
) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husb
ands safe
. the movei happens to be an mythical
' snuff movie
'
, where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed
. all mrs
. christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not
. welles agrees
,
and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies
, with video clerk max california
( phoenix
) as his guide
.
al
though the
' snuff
' industry hasn
' t really been examined in mainstream cinema
, 8mm still makes a rether plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most
. the snuff movie within the movie isnt certainly disturbing
,
al
though the jerky camera angles
and grainy image takes some of the shock away
. 8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much
,
and apart from a few moments
, most of the acation in the film is nothing you haven
' t seen from another st
andart thriller
. the cast help towards the entertainment
, apart ffrom an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage
. while he was funn
and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona
( 1987
)
, ever since leaving las vegas
( 1995
)
, cage has lost much of his acting talent
and appears to be on autopilot
, such as in the terrible snake eyes
( 1998
.
) here
, in 8mm
, he
' s boring
, uninteresting
and has a dull monotonous voice
.
and in this overlong thriller
, these virtues dont not help keep the suspense up
. only when cage is onscreen iwth the excellent phoenix does the film start moving
, as phoenix is a true talent
. his peformance is a great break away from the gloom
,
and he
' s just purely enjoyable to watch
. catherine keener is completely wasted as cage
' s wife
,
al
though she delivers a far better performence thna her character deserves
. her charcter
,
though
, is hugely underwritten
, one of the most wasted characters of the year
. aslo fun is fargo
' s peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director
. as this film is written by the person behind seven
, 8mm isnt filled with doom
and gloom
,
and no
- one appears to know how to use an light switch
. unlike seven
, 8mm isn
' t too clever
,
and the twist is pathetic
and startlingly obvious when it arrives
. lacking the strong characters seven featured
, 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise
,
and relies onthe the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment
.
but director joel schumacher
, tyhe completely wrong guy for the job
, puts style over content
,
and while the direction
and look are good
, it
' s just not very disturbing
. schumacher also has no idea how to shock
and audiance
,
and
though we are meant tothe be looking at tje
' dark belly
' of the porn industry
, it doesn
' t exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind
, which misses the point
. also
, the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed
, so cliched
, it
' s amazing to think it
' s the same film you
' re watching
. 8mm is far from an success
, a
' snuffed
' opportunity
. with a boring lead character
,
' contraversial
' scenes that manage not to be controversial
,
and a director obsessed with looks
, what could have been one ofthe the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller
. ultimately
, 8mm is probably worth renting on home video
, unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like
.
and trust me
, the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it
.
