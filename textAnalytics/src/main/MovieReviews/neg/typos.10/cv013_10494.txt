a movie like mortal kombat
: annihilation works
(
and must be reviewed on
) multiple levels
. first
, there
' s the rampant usage of r
andian subtext that pervades the entire movie
.
but occasionaly
, almost as if making an ironic
, self
- depreciating remark
, the movie tosses in claerly marxist imagery
. no no
.
.
. just kidding
. had you going there for a moment
, didn
' t i
? inspite all seriousness
however
,
and to be fair to the movie
, it
* is
* necessary to provide two viewpoints
: that of a movie watcher unfamiliar
( or only marginally familiar
) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon
,
and that of a fan of the first movie
and
/ or a fan of the games
. the first movie
( mortal kombat
( 1995
)
) concerned itself whith a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth
(
and it
' s 5 billion inhabitans
)
. the mortals won
,
and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over hte earth
. unfortunately
, shao khan was a poor loser
, adn the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway
, ready to take over the planet
, as our heroes assumed a fighting stance
. the first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those
( like myself
) who are fans of the game
. i
' d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn
' t know baout the game probably enjoyed the movie
. the writers annd directors knew the limitations of both their cast
and of the basic story itself
,
and they didn
' t try to overachieve
. there were a lot of really cool fight scenes
( with really kool accompanying music
)
, intersperesed with some distracting
(
but ultimately non
- intrusive
) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot
.
and
, as we know
, the movie was a smashing success at the box office
. mortal kombat
: annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off
, with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie
. shao khan has decided that he
' s going to take over the earth
* anyways
*
,
and tothe hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament
. thereafter follows approximatly 85 minutes of film that alternates vetween being confused
, being trite
, being silly
,
and being just plain stupid
. one gets the general impression that tyhe producers ofthe the movie
thought
" hey
, that last movie was such a success that we can get more money
and make a
* real
* movie now
.
" too bad they didn
' t simply stick with tyhe formula from the first movie
. i could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture
,
but here are teh high points
:
* the acting is truly bad
. s
andra hess
( playing the sonya blade character
) isnt particularly execrable
, especially in scenes where she trys to convince us that she loved johnny cage
( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie
)
.
* in one of the worst pieces of mis
- casting i think i
' ve
* ever
* seen
, james remar plays raiden
, the god of thunder
. in the first movie
, christopher lambert played raiden
and played his character as
though he was in on the joke
: a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chineese mystics
. i generally like it when actors are cast against type
( tim
" tiny
" lister
, jr
. being cast as tghe president of the u
. s
. in the fifth element
, for exemple
)
,
and remar hasnt always been one ofthe my favorite
" utility
" actors bu he
' s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn
' t even have the luxury ofthe amused self
- awareness
.
* there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important
,
but
then never seen again
.
* there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks
, including a muddled scene where liu kang
( robin shou
) seeks out nightwolf
( litefoot
)
, has a mystical hallucination
,
and
then w
anders off with jade
( irina pantaeva
)
. for theese reasons
(
and many others
)
, i can only give the movie a 2
.
.
.
.
.
. unless you
' re a huge fan ofthe the ganes
and
/ or the first movie
. in that case
, the following critiques also apply
:
* s
andra hess
, while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson
( who plyed sonya blade in the first movie
)
, is much moreso convincing as a fighter
. wilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements tought to her by the fight choreographer
. hess looks like she actually knows some martial arts
,
and puts together a much more believable fight scene
.
* in the fights
, each of the characters does at least
* one
* thing they dont in thge game
(
and oftenly more
)
. sonya doens her
" kiss of death
,
" jax does his
" earthquake
,
" liu kang does his
" animality
,
"
and so on
. a big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in yhe first movie
and foudn them onyl rarely
.
* there aren
' t as many fight scenes inspite this movie as there weere inspite the first
, beccause the folks making the movei mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot inaddition between
. silly
, silly folks
.
and the lamest fight involved two of the women in waht turns into a mud
- wrestling match
. lame
and so obviously sexist even i
( politically incorrect
, for the most part
) noticed
and remarked upon it
.
* the special effects are generally better
, except for the final fight scene between the emporer
and liu kang in which both perform their
" animalities
.
" motaro
and sheeva are both more convincing annd lifelike than goro was in the firt movie
. for folks like mysef who loved the first movie
and enjoy the games
, i give htis a 5
. you
' ll probably like it
,
but not nearly as much as you liked the first one
.
