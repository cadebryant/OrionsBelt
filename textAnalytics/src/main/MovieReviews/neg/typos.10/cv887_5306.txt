this talky
, terribly
- plotted thriller stars alec baldwin as dave robicheaux
, an ex
- new orleans cop who gets ensnared in a murder
- mystery after a light
- plane crashes into the bayou beside his fishing boat
. he
and his wife annie
( kelly lynch

) fomr the wreckage
and that
' s when the trouble begins

, his scheming wife
( teri hatcher
)
, a soused stripper

)
. everyone knows everyone alse
and it makes for a collective that
' s curious
but never compelling
. based on the book by james lee burke
, heaven
' s prisoners is so badly plotted thgat entire
* scenes
* seem tothe be missing
. early on
, we have no idae of why dave
and annie keep the child to themselves
. nor how htey eluded both the coast guard
and the faa
. later
, dave is reunited with a drug
- abuser who appears seemingly clean
and sober
and without any explaination
. huh
? the whole movie is like this
, perhaps the result ofthe smoe unkind cuts taht happened during tjhe eighteen months that the film sat on the shelf
. whatever the reason
, somebody should tell director phil joanou
( final analysis
) to recut this mess
. inwhich its present form
, heaven
' s prisoners runs only two hours plus change
,
but it feels like four
.
