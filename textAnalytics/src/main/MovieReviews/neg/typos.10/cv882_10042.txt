] there are many philosophies as tothe why we are so fascinated with cartoons
. they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within thier context
, from tjhe outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity ofthe japanimation
. watching
" flubber
" really clinched this idea fo me
, because it ' s just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy
. it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags
and slapstick would be in reality
,
and how important it is to actually have a stroy
. the film wastes no time infront establishing its lighthearted
, cartoony atmosphere
. we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard
( williams
)
, the typical
, suposedly likable mad scientist
. within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is
. phillip ' s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag
and more like a real case ofthe alzhiemer ' s disease
- isn ' t this rather lowbrow comedy
? he starts teaching chemistry aftter walking in on a nude figure drawing class
( an inapropriate joke forthe a kids ' movie if i ever saw one
)
. we learn he has stood his up fiancee
, sara
( harden
)
, twice at the altar simply because he ' s forgotten
. sara claimes to love him
,
but says if he forgets the wedding again she ' ll stop loving him
( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has
)
.
but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve
,
and it ' s no surprise the major conflicts here are realted
. christopher mcdonald does
and even worse verison of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft
, a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip ' s ideas
,
but his woman too
. what ' s worse is that sara actually seems interested in him
! wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield
, whcih is gonig broke
, unless phillip cxan invent something to save the day
. one of the first rules ofthe filmmaking is tothe make sure the title has something tothe do with the film
. the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced
,
but is all
but forgotten baout thereafter
. it ' s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber
, a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy
,
and the promotions make tyhe flubber look realistic
and funny
. unfortunately
, the flubber
, like all the spacial effects in this film
, looks very fake
and unconvincing
. flubber also seems to ahve intelligence
adn a personality
,
and by the time it performs a song
and dance routine
, you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object
. most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy
( since phillip ' s absent
- mindedness is forgotten about
)
and somehow push the stopry along
.
but it ' s clear how weak htis premise is from the get
- go
and tyhe film jstu gets worse
. all thge jokes involve people getting hit by fast
- moving
, flubber
- powered objects including
: bowling balls
; flying cars that don ' t fly well
;
anbd a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air
. it ' s all presented with complete logic
,
and no one believes flubber exists even wehn they see it with their own eyes
. during the basketball scene
, tjhe coach for the rival team actually says
,
" i think htey might be cheating
,
" to which the referee replies
,
" there ' s no rules about jumping too high
.
"
" predictable
" doesn ' t begin to describe the motions the film goes through
, especially after the halfway point
.
and it ' s not how terribly contrived the plot is
, it ' s the way it ' s broken down scene
- by
- scene
, with absolutely no transition
. not only that
,
bu all the actors here
, especially williams
, seem borde tothe tears
. i ' d say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen
, so it ' s almost forgivable when you realize they ' re talking to nothing
and interacting with nothing
. it ' s safe to say everthing that could be bad about
" flubber
" is
. the only original element the film has is tyhe world ' s first romance between a machine
and a human
.
but this aspect is quite twisted if you think baout it
,
and
, like the rest of the film
, ytou won ' t
.
