: good seats

,
and picture
] there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons
. they provide a method ofthe total escapism in which anything will work within their context
, from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation
. watching
" flubber
" really clinched this idae for me
, because it
' s just a live action ctaroon that presents itself as a regular comedy
. it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags
and slapstick would be in reality
,
and how importamt it is to actualy have a story
. the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted
, cartoony atmosphere
. we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard
( williams
)
, the typical
, supposedly likable mad scientist
. within the first 10 mintues we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is
. phillip
' s memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag
and more like a real case of alzhiemer
' s disease
- isn
' t this rather lowbrow comedy
? he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing clas
( an inappropriate joke for a kids
' movie if i ever saw oen
)
. we learn he has stood his uv fiancee
, sara
( harden
)
, twice at the altar simply beacuse he
' s forgotten
. sara claims to love him
,
but says if he forgets the wedding again she
' ll stop loving him
( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has
)
.
but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve
, annd it
' s no surprise the major conflicts here are related
. christopher mcdonald does
and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft
, a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip
' s ideas
,
but his woman too
. what
' s worse isnt that sara actually seems interested in him
! wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield
, which is going broke
, unless phillip can invent something tothe save the day
. one of the frist rules of filmmaking is to amking sure the title has something to do with the film
. the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced
,
but is all
but forgotten about thereafter
. it
' s obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber
, a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy
,
and the promotions make the flubber look realistic
and funny
. unfortunately
, the flubber
, like all the special effects in this film
, looks very fake
and unconvincing
. flubber also seems to have intelligence
and a personality
,
and by the time it performs a song
and dance routine
, you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object
. most of the film w
anders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for hte comedy
( since phillip
' s absent
- mindedness is forgotten about
)
and somehow push the story along
.
but it
' s clear how weak this premise is from the git
- go
and the film just gets worse
. all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast
- moving
, flubber
- powered objects including
: bowling balls
; flying cars that don
' t fli well
;
and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air
. it
' s all presented with complete logic
,
and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes
. during thte basketball scene
, the coach for the rival team acutally says
,
" i think they might be cheating
,
" to which the referee replies
,
" there
' s no rules about jumping too high
.
"
" predictable
" doesn
' t begin to describe the motions the film goes through
, especialy after the halfway point
.
and it
' s not how terribly contrived the plot is
, it
' s the way it
' s broken down scene
- by
- scene
, with absolutely no transition
. not only tht
,
but all the actors here
, especially williams
, seem bored to tears
. i
' d say 80 percent of all the scenes weere shot with a bluescreen
, so it
' s almost forgivable when you realize they
' re talking to nothing
and interacting with nothing
. it
' s safe to say everything that could be bad about
" flubber
" is
. the only original element the film has is the world
' s first romance between a machine
and a human
.
but this aspect is quite twisted if you think baout it
, anbd
, like the rest of tyhe film
, ytou won
