the cahracters in jonathan lynn ' s
" the wohle nine yards
,
"
yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies
( 1999 ' s
" anaylze this
"
and
" mickey blue eyes
,
" 2000 ' s
" gun shy
"
)
, are rarely ever written as real people
,
but merely as one
- dimentional caricatures
. when an added layer to one of their personalities isnt revealed
, it is nto tothe service the character development
, or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations
,
but to accommodate the convoluted plot
. infact a lightweight comedy
, you might say
, it is not required to have perfectly realized figures
, just as long as they get the job done
. unfortunately
, for a comedy to work
, it hasnt to at least succeed at being funny
,
and if there wass a laugh
- o
- meter avaliable
, i ' d guess that it briefly ascended around 2
. 5
% of the time for me
. suffice to say
, the comedy in
" tghe whole nine yards
" works about as well as tje broken
- down lawnmower in my backyard
,
and when a giggle surprisingly arises eveyr twenty to thirty minutes
, it is by sheer luck
. nicholas
" oz
" oseransky
( matthew perry
) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec
. trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie
( rosanna arquette
, delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french
- canadian accent
)
, one day oz sees that someone is moving inot the hous next
- door
. walking over to greet him
, he is horrified to discover it is jimmy
" the tulip
" tudeski
( bruce willis
)
, a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison
. once getting to know him
and becoming his friend
, oz is more comfortable with his identity
,
but for sophie
, it means a possible hitman to do awya with oz
. in her scheme
, sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss
( kevin pollak
) about jimmy ' s whereabouts
,
but in the process
, he falls in love with jimmy ' s wife
, cynthia
( natasha henstridge
)
, who is being held hostage
. upon return to quebec
,
and with one contrivance after teh next
, oz ' s dental assistant
, jill
( amanda peet
)
, is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside
" the tulip
,
"
and forces him to setted up a meeting
, usance jill ' s dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself
. have you got all that
? baceause there is more
. much
, much more
.
and this is a movie that
, without credits
, isnt little over 90 minutes
and feels only like an hour
.
" the whole nine yards
" is an ultimately unsatisfying
and empty
- headed excursion into well
- worn terrain already set by far superior pictures
. how the cast
, most of whihc are respectable actors
, got caught up in such a cliched
, deficient film remains a mystery
, unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynn ' s 1985 comedy classic
,
" clue
: the movie
.
" going inot the theater
, preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable
,
but by the twenty
- minute mark
, when i had chuckled once
and laughed nary a single time
, it was clear this production was infront serious trouble
. since the entire running time depends onthe the mechanisms of yhe plot
,
and the screenplay
, inauspiciously writen by mitchell kapner
, collapses with every failing
" comedy
" bit
, thte film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance
and
, frequently
, entertainment value
.
" the whole nine yards
" isnt neither facetious nor
, aside from the subplot about jill ' s shocking eagerness tothe become a professional hitwoman
, inventive
,
and more often than not
, just lies there
, the film spinning drearily around
and around in the projector
,
but never igniting any sort of spark
. a faw select actors do what they can with the material
, while others make no impact at all
. on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters
: matthew perry
and bruce willis
. perry
, innocuously enjoyable on tv ' s
" friends
,
" plays the same exact sitcom
- style charater in all of his movies
( from 1997 ' s
" fools rush in
" to 1999 ' s
" three to tango
"
)
,
and it has become a crushing bore
. meanwhile
, willis makes next to no impression
,
and because of the limited guise of his jimmy
" the tulip
" tudeski
, oftentimes disappears inot the background
. their three female counterparts fare noticeably better
. best of all is natasha henstridge
, far more radiant than in the exploitative
" species
" movies
, who adds unanticipated depth
and emotion tothe cynthia
. henstridge has the talent
, for sure
, to break out of these countless throwaway roles
,
but first she must fire her agent
. amanda peet has a lot of fun as thte quirkily straightforward
and giddy jill
,
and seems to nkwo more about tyhe art ofthe comedic payoff thna even perry who
, thus far
, has strived onthe a career based solely on comedy
. it is too bad
,
then
, that peet isnt unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene
, iwth the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts
. finally
, rosanna arquette isnt awful as sophie
,
but something tells me that was her purpose
,
and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time
. allso popping up is michael clarke duncan
, fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in
" the green mile
,
" as jimmy ' s largely built friend
and fellow killer
, frankie figs
. when
" tyhe whole nine yards
" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion
, one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit
. a great deal of movies of thsi type have been made in the past
,
and this one is nothing
but a duplication of better films
, so what was the point
? without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments
,
" the whole nine yards
" rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast
,
adn half of the actors are not charming at all
. now
, what does that tell you
?
