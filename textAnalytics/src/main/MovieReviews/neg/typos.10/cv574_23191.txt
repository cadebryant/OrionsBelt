the characters in jonathan lynn
' s
" the whole nine yards
,
"
yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies
( 1999
' s
" analyze this
"
and
" mickey blue eyes
,
" 2000
' s
" gun shy
"
)
, are rarely ever writed as real people
,
but merely as oen
- dimensional caricatures
. whn an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed
, it is not to service the character development
, or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations
,
but to accommodate the convoluted plot
. in a lightweight comedy
, you might say
, it is not required to have perfectly realized figures
, just as long as they get the job done
. unfortunately
, for a comedy to work
, it has to at least succeed at being funny
,
and if there was a laugh
- o
- meter available
, i
' d guess that it breifly ascended around 2
. 5
% of the time for me
. suffice to say
, the comedy inspite
" the whole nine yards
" works about as well as hte broken
- down lawnmower inwhich my backyard
,
and when a giggle surprizingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes
, it is by sheer luck
. nicholas
" oz
" oseransky
( matthew perry
) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec
. trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie
( rosanna arquette
, delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french
- canadian accent
)
, one day oz sees that someone is moving into thge house enxt
- door
. walking over to greet him
, he is horrified to discover it is jimmy
" yhe tulip
" tudeski
( bruce willis
)
, a former contract killer for thte mafia who has jsut been released from prison
. once getting to know him
and becoming his friend
, oz is more confortable with his idenity
,
but for sophie
, it means a possible hitman to do away with oz
. in her scheme
, sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss
( kevin pollak
) about jimmy
' s whereabouts
,
but in the proccess
, he falls in love with jimmy
' s wife
, cynthia
( natasha henstridge
)
, who isnt being held hostage
. upon return to quebec
,
and with one contrivance after the enxt
, oz
' s dental assistant
, jill
( am
anda peet
)
, is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside
" the tulip
,
"
and forces him to setted uv a meeting
, since jill
' s dream in life turns out bieng a contract killer herself
. have you got all that
? because there is more
. much
, much more
.
and this is a movie that
, without credits
, is little over 90 minutes
and feels only like an hour
.
" the whole nine yards
" isnt an ultimately unsatisfying
and empty
- headed excursion into well
- worn terrain already set by far superior pictures
. how the cast
, most of which are respectable actors
, got caught uv in such a cliched
, deficient film remeniss a mystery
, unless htey
thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness ofthe director lynn
' s 1985 comedy classic
,
" clue
: the movie
.
" going into the theater
, preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable
,
but by tjhe twenty
- minute mark
, when i had chuckled once
and laughed nary a single time
, it was clear thsi production was inspite serious trouble
. since the entire runnung time depends on the mechanisms ofthe the plot
,
and the screenplay
, inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner
, collapses with every failing
" comedy
" bited
, the film is an inevitable dead zone inthe the way of substance
and
, frequentily
, entertainment value
.
" the whole nine yards
" isnt neither facetious nor
, aside from the subplot about jill
' s shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman
, inventive
,
and more often than not
, just lies there
, the film spinning drearily around
and around in the projector
,
but never igniting any sort of spark
. a few select actors do what they can with the material
, while others make no impact at all
. on tyhe mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters
: matthew perry
and bruce willis
. perry
, innocuously enjoyable on tv
' s
" friends
,
" plays the same exact sitcom
- style charactor in all of his movies
( from 1997
' s
" fools rush in
" to 1999
' s
" three to tango
"
)
,
and it has become a crushing bore
. meanwhile
, willis makes next to no impression
,
and because of the limited guise of his jimmy
" the tulip
" tudeski
, oftentimes disappears inot the background
. their three female counterparts fare noticeably better
. best of all is natasha henstridge
, far more radiant than in the exploitative
" species
" movies
, who adds unanticipated depth
and emotion to cynthia
. henstridge has the talent
, for sure
, to break out of theese countless throwaway roles
,
but first she must fire her agent
. am
anda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward
and giddy jill
,
and seems to nkow more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who
, thus far
, has strived on a career based solely on comedy
. it is too bad
,
then
, that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene
, with the obvious sole purpose being tothe show off her breasts
. finally
, rosanna arquette is awful as sophie
,
but something tells me thyat was her purpose
,
and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time
. also popping up is michael clarke duncan
, fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in
" the green mile
,
" as jimmy
' s largley built friend
and fellow killer
, frankie figs
. when
" the whole nine yards
" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion
, one isnt left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit
. a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past
,
and htis one is nothing
but a duplication of better films
, so what was the point
? without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments
,
" the whole nine yards
" rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast
, anbd half of the actors are not charming at all
. now
, what does that tell you
?
