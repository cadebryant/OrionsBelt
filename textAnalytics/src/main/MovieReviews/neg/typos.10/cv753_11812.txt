bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures
. mercury rising adds to a growing list
( including such stinkers as thge jackal
, last man st
anding
, striking distance
and tyhe last boy scout
) of stale actioners he has headlined
.
and
though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix
, it is every bit as stale
. art jeffries
( bruce willis
) is your typical tormented fbi agent
. you know the tipe
, haunted by his job
,
yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist
. enter simon
( miko hughes
)
, an autistic boy
, who
, like rain man
and all other autistic peopel
, is a savant
. he can merely gaze at a super
- encrypted message
,
and
, while little cmoputer beeps go off in his head
, he can underst
and what it says
. naturally
, this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal govorment
. lt
. col
. nicholas kudrow
( alec baldwin
)
, an nsa official bubbling over with evil
, has spent countless time
and money implamenting the newest
" unbreakable
" code
, mercury
.
however
, when two of his underlings
( robert stanton
and bodhi pine elfman
) publish a mercury
- encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a fianl test of its effectiveness
, simon cracks the code
. naturally
, this infuriates kudrow
, who sends a terminator
- like hitman
( l
. l
. ginter
) to eliminate the security hazard
.
and that
' s where art jeffries comes in
. for some reason that
' s never explained in the film
, the fbi is called in to help
,
and through a series of intricate machinations
, art becomes the sole protector of hte young autistic boy
. in a few unrealistic sequences
, he enlists the aid of a stranger
, stacey
( kim dickens
)
, to help out
,
but she is given very little to do overall
. the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous
. why bother trying to kill the kid
.
.
. i mean
, who would know
? it
' s not like the kid
( or anyone else for that matter
) knew he was cracking a government super
- cypher
.
and even if he is eliminated
, what does that help
? he
' s already proven that mercury can be broken
. there
' s always the chance that someone alse would crack it
.
.
.
but i guess without a kid in jeopardy
, there
' s not much of a movie here
. for all its faults
, the film actually starts relatively well
( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser
)
. the film flirts wiht developing real characters
, anbd a semblance of a plot
.
.
.
then mr
. terminator the hitman appears
and everything begins going downhill
.
.
. quicklyu
. miko hughes does a decent job
, fo his age
, at creating a touching performance
.
however
, don
' t go to this film looking for any new insights into autism
( not that many people iwll
)
. instead he merely becomes hte latest unique partner in a routine buddy
- cop movie
( think cop
and a half
.
.
. with a twist
!
) willis anbd baldwin are just overplaying to type
. rather than creating a nuanced character
, baldwin simply oozes sliminess
.
and for willis
' part
, he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop
/ fbi agent
( which he has honed in the die hard sories
)
. as almost an after
thought
, about halfway through
, the film carelessly gives him a character trait
( an addiction
)
, adn
then drops it in the next scene
.
but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay
. this film wasn
' t well
thought out at all
. the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible
. the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member
. at first the bad scenes just trickle in
,
but by the gruesomely bad finale they
' re a veritable flood
. teh film
' s few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes
( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode
)
.
but they
' re not nearly enough to mkea the film worthwhile
. mercury rising isnt a thriller that you
' re more likely to groan at than cheer
.
