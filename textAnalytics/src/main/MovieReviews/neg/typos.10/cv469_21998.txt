hollywood never fails to astound me
. every time i htink those coked
- up little buggers have hit rock bottom
; they come up withthe a new excavating tool
. i was truly convinced that
" wild wild west
" marked 1999 studio filmmaking at its most hapless
,
but
then allong comes
" end of days
" tothe prove me wrong
. this big budget
, brain dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music
, grisly violence
, explosions galore
and lots of cheesy special effects
. the result
? nothing bu groans
and yawns
. even the devil himself is unable to produce a decent scare in this festival of the inept
. at the very least
,
" end of days
" should have done us tjhe courtesy of being bad
- enough
- to
- be
- good
,
but it cant
' t even manage that
. it
' s just lousy
. arnold schwarzenegger
, still recovering from heart problems
and
" batman
& robin
,
" plays an ex
- cop turned security agent or bodyguard or something
. along with his obligatory comic relief partner
( kevin pollak
, impersonating matthew perry
' s ch
andler character from
" friends
"
)
, he gets involved in soem major league supernatural hoodoo
. it seems that satan
( gabriel byrne
) gets a shot at world domination only once every thous
and years
(
and here i
thought he
' d pulled it off with the republican l
andslide of
' 94
)
. if he has sex with 20
- yera old christine york
( robin tunney
)
,
" the chosen one
,
" their child will be the antichrist
, or at least a brat
. ah
,
but this deel has more catches than a new year
' s eve pass fomr a halfway house
. the unholy union must tkae place on december 31
, 1999
( you see
, 999 is just 666 turned upside down
)
,
but only between 11 p
. m
.
and midnight
( noone wonder this guy is so cranky
)
.
and if the chosen one is given refuge in a church
, the devil won
' t know where she is
, because he can
' t see into tjhe sanctuary
. you know
, it
' s kind of like superman
' s x
- ray vision
and lead walls
, only evil
. a gropu of guerrilla cathlic priests decide the best way to stop the situation is by killing the girl
. arnold chooses to save tjhe girl annd kick the hell out of satan
, if you
' ll pardon the expression
.
and kevin meets up with an exploding van
and has to make some decisions of his own
. oh
, the anguish
! oh
, the humanity
! oh
, the writing
!
andrew w
. marlowe
' s screenplay ladles implausibility upon implausibility
, from the preposterous otherworldly histrionics to his h
andling of jericho cane
, schwarzenegger
' s character
. cane starts the film a la mel gibson in the first
" lethal weapon
,
" preparing to put a gun in his mouth due to ongoing despondence over the murder of his wife
and duaghter
. twenty minutes later
, he
' s racing through the bowels of new york city
, deciphering clues that sherlock holmes
and kreskin would find baffling
. when canew meets up withthe christine york
, he instantly switchs to terminator father figure mode
, with the young woman serving as surrogate daughter
. in case anyone misses the connection
, the camera comes in for a close up of christine
' s music box
, which just happens to be identical to noe owned by cane
' s duaghter
. subtle
, marlowe
, subtle
. speaking of cameras
, director peter hyams is just the man to take marlowe
' s script
and make it even more self
- important
, murky
and annoying
. hyams
' direction shows all the subtlety of a gwar video
, with cane running a gauntlet of ridiculous action set pieces
, punctuated with loads of big explosions
. eager to satisfy arnold
' s core audience
, he even throws in a few pairs ofthe breasts as well
. what a guy
. had the film delivered some decent scares
, or even maintained a consistently ominous tone
, the bombastic clich
? s might have been tolerable
,
but
" end of days
" is simply a flaccid special effects show
. the cast is just as ineffective
. in his early scenes
, gabriel byrne attempts to invest beelzebub with some panache
,
but he all too soon turns into just another st
andard issue monster
. kevin pollak comes
and goes quickly
, robin tunney comes off like a bargain basement winona ryder
and as for arnold
, well
? he
' s a better actor than casper van dien
. thast shouldnt count for something
. way back in the aftermath
" the exorcist
"
and
" the omen
,
" supernatural swill like
" end of days
" might have passed muster as a b
- movie
.
but that was
then
and this is now
.
" the x
- files
"
and
" buffy the vampire slayer
" deliver real scares on a weekly basis
and
, if we wanna to see the devil
, all we have tothe do is flip on
" the 700 club
" annd tkae a g
ander at pat robertson
' s grinning maw
. after enduring
" end of days
,
" all i can say is
" get thee behind me
, satan
. adn while you
' re at it
, get thee a better agent as well
.
