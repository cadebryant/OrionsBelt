! jalla
! isnt basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead forthe the wide screen
. it tells the story of two park custodians
and the problems they are finding on the path to true love
. the film is set in sweden where roro
and mans
( fares fares
and torkel petersson
) are custodians at a public park
. roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him vyre closely
, mans isnt a swede from a much moreso liberal background
. they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park
, cleaning up aftter dogs
. roro
and mans each have girlfriends
,
but each has a problem
. roro
( nicknamed
" jalla
"
) is having family problems
. it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him
and a nice lebanese woman
, yasmin
( laleh pourkarim
)
,
but he is alrady in love with lisa
( tuva novotny
)
. yasmin likes roro
,
bu does not want to get married either
. mans on thge other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence
. the two friends worry about their problems
and discuss the problems with each other
. mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers
. the one catch is that he is too shy to go in
and buy them
. roro
and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other
,
but
then plan to break up before the wedding
. nto too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected
. the plot turns in several places are contrived
. one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen
. lebanese
- born josef fares who wrote
and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer
. when things start to get slow
, he jsut adds throws in another story
. for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs
and a long chase is added to the film
. characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot omre personality beyond fear for losing a biological function
. we do see some of roro ' s family life
annd his concerns
. taht may be because roro ' s background is a lot like that of the directer
. while the tsory wass entertaining
, i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film
. it was just a way to pass about an hour
and a half in my life
. one does not have to go to teh movies to see entertainment like this
. i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
