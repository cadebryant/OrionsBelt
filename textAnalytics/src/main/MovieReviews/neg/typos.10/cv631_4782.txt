the swooping shots accros darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movei
,
but
, alas
, no caped crusader descends to save
* tihs
* film
. instead
, it
' s a skeletal housemaid
( julia roberts
) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of
" dr
. jekyll
and mr
. hyde
.
" for a few
, fleeting
, maddening moments
, director stephen frears
( dangerous liaisons
) gets everything just right
-
- the tone
, the colors
, the characters
; all the ingredients tothe amking a most
- powerful potion out of valerie martin
' s best
- selling novel
.
yet it fizzles too quickly
; the volatile mixture loosing potency ffrom the very first scene
. casting is a large part of the problem
. the story all
but collap
- ses around ms
. roberts
-
- she doesn
' t have the range for tihs kind of drama
. her accent also comes anbd goes
,
though it
' s nowhere near as glaring as the total lack ofthe chemistry between her
and co
- star john malkovich
.
( he looks the same in both of his roles
-
- an incredible fact that
' s missed by everyone in the story
!
) hte vyre british supporting cast
-
- including michael gambon
and george cole
-
- gives credibility to the smaller parts
. glenn close also appears as a madam tyhat the good doctor calls upon
. her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets
and
-
- as a bonus
-
- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live
- action 101 dalmantions
. yhe biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense
: there is none
. no terror
, no tension
; nothing
. without any weight
, wit
, or wonder to propel the story
, the viewer is left with little omre to do than pay attension to thge period detail
, a few buckets of blood
,
and stuart craig
' s fabulously dreary production design
. all of which gets old after about an hour
, at which point i recommend leaving
.
( the pacing in tyhe second
- half isnt especially abominable
. if you
* do
* stick it through
, your sole reward is a half
- hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation
.
) mr
. frears reportedly recut his film several times
, missing severeal release dates in the process
.
( obviously
, no one advised him to throw up his h
ands
and jstu turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks
. blucher
!
) mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story of thge month
, after muppet treasure isl
and
. perhaps mr
. frears should consult with brian henson on future projects
. i daresay that even ms
. piggy isnt a better choice for a certain roles than julia roberts
. annd she does have a great chop
