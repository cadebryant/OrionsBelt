i heard acotr skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple ofthe interviews
,
and inthe both instances
, he felt tjhe stange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon
. now
, i personally rember those films as a
) starring a major motion picture star b
) being funny c
) having great action sequences d
) great chemistry e
) decent character delevopment
. hmmm
.
.
.
. okay
.
.
. now on tothe my review of chill factor
. plot
: a graveyard shift regular working joe
and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex
- army general
, to propose a nuculear device to intenational prospects
. when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps
, they must keep it cool on ice
, annd rush it over to an army base
, before hte contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit
, adn kills millions of people
. critique
:
" speed on an ice
- cream truck
" is probably the pitch that was utilisied to sell this one
- tone movie to its backers
,
but unfortunately
, the only way that anyone could compare htis film to that tension
- filled
, original two hours of cinema
, is in its distict honor of bieng tje complete opposite of what that film
,
and the lethal weapon movies
, stood for
. this film is seasoned in cliches
, with plenty of badly written dialogue
, over the top acting from cuba gooding jr
.
, zero chemistry between the two leads
,
and horribly tacky bad guys
, tossed in to complete an overall bad movie recipe
. my friend
and i enjoyed watching this movie tothe a certain extent
, because some of the lines in it were so bad
and obviously
" written
"
, that we just hadnt to crack up
. that
,
and the formula for the film
' s script which followed the proverbial 1
- 2
-
,
and you guessed it
.
.
. 3 scenario
!
and what about all those catchy
, hip names to get us to relate to tghe characters
.
.
.
.
" elvis
"
and
" nighshift
"
, oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters
(
and yes
, it actually tookover two guys to come up with this regurgitated drivel
)
. it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich
and cuba gooding jr
. got involved in this one
- week
- old
- blue
- cheese
- smelling project
. did htey ctually think that it would boost their careers
, or did they know that tje script sucked
,
but discounted any fall from grace
, knowing full well that the stack of cash in their back pockets would pad their fall
? most probably the latter
. have you seen either fled or bulletproof
? well
, dispite the slight differences in plot
, the essentials are basically the same here
. you get a black guy
and a white guy bieng chased by a bunch ofthe people
, having no choice
but to work together to get somewhere
, hating each other at first
,
but over time
, learning to respect one another as individuals
. yawn
. add to that
, tghe fact that our film actually has bad guys who are all dressed in balck
, drive black cars
and black vans
,
and run around withthe all kinds ofthe telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head
. not too conspicuous
, eh
? call me a party
- pooper
,
but as much as i like a nice cheezy movei as much as the next guy
, this film just doesn
' t even try to do anything original or reasonably entertaining
. one cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside
,
and another with a nuclear device obliterating everything on an isl
and
, dont not a fun
, buddy
- action flick make
. show cuba the money
, everybody
!
:
) little known facts about this film
and its stars
: this is not a little known fact or anything
,
but damn
, is it just me or doesnt skeet ulrich look an awful lot like great
