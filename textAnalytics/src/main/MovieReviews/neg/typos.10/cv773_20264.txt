i heard actor skeet ulrich discussing this film in a couple of interviews
,
and in both instances
, he felt the strange compulsion to compare it a little series of films called lethal weapon
. now
, i personally remember those films as a
) starring a major motion picture star b
) being funny c
) having great action sequences d
) great chemestry e
) decent character development
. hmmm
.
.
.
. okay
.
.
. now on to my review of chill factor
. plot
: a graveyard shift regular working joe
and ice cream truck driver fall onto a malicious plan by an ex
- army general
, tothe propose a nuculear device to international prospects
. when the device suddenly falls into their reluctant laps
, they must keep it cool on ice
,
and rush it over to an army base
, before the contraption ticks over 50 degrees fahrenheit
,
and kills millions of people
. critique
:
" speed on an ice
- cream truck
" is probably the pitch that was used to sell this one
- tone movie tothe its backers
,
but unfortunatly
, the only way that anyone sould compare this film to that tension
- filled
, original two hours of cinema
, is in its distinct honor of being the complete opposite of what that film
,
and the lethal weapon movies
, stood for
. this film is seasoned in cliches
, with plenty of badly written dialogue
, over the top acting from cuba gooding jr
.
, zero chemestry beween the two leads
,
and horribly tacky bad guys
, tossed inthe to complete an overall bad movie recipe
. my friend
and i enjoyed watching this movie to a ceratin extent
, because some of the lines in it were so bad
and obviously
" written
"
, that we jstu had to crack up
. that
,
adn the formula for the film ' s script which followed the proverbial 1
- 2
-
,
and you guessed it
.
.
. 3 scenario
!
and what about all those catchy
, hip names to get us to relate to tyhe characters
.
.
.
.
" elvis
"
and
" nighshift
"
, oh what talent lies in the minds of these screenwriters
(
and yes
, it actually took two guys tothe come uv with this regurgitated drivel
)
. it is unfathomable to me as to how actors skeet ulrich
and cuba gooding jr
. got involved in this one
- week
- old
- blue
- cheese
- smelling project
. did they actually tihkn that it would boost their careers
, or did they know that the script sucked
,
but discounted any fall from grace
, knowing full well that the stack of cash inwhich their back pockets would pad their fall
? most probably the latter
. have you seen either fleed or bulletproof
? well
, despite the slight differences in plot
, the essentials are basically the same here
. you get a black guy
and a white guy being chased by a bunch of people
, having no choice
but to work together to get somewhere
, hating each other at first
,
but over time
, learning to respect one another as individuals
. yawn
. add to thgat
, hte fact that our film actually hasnt bad guys who are all dressed in balck
, drive black cars
annd black vans
,
and run around with all kinds of telecommunicative devices sprinkled around their head
. not too conspicuous
, eh
? call me a party
- pooper
,
but as much as i like a nice cheezy movie as much as the next guy
, this film just doesn ' t even try tothe do anything original or reasonably entertaining
. oen cool scene with a boat careening down a mountainside
,
annd another with a nuclear device obliterating everything onthe an island
, do not a fun
, buddy
- action flick make
. show cuba the money
, everybody
!
:
) little known facts about this film
and its stars
