when walt disney picturesk announced a live
- action feature based on the
' 60s cartoon sories of
" mr
. magoo
,
" special interests groups representing the vision
- impaired let outloud a cry of dismay
. mr
. magoo
, they claimed
, would be an insult to the men
and women they represented
. in fact
, they were wrong
. mr
. magoo is not just an insult to the blind
and near
- blind
, it
' s an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny
, 90 minute atrocity
. it
' s stating the obvious tothe remark that disney appears to have run out of orginal ideas
. look at their roster of 1996
and 1997 releases
, anbd you
' ll see a shocking list of retreads
, including 101 dalmatians
, george of the jungle
, jungle2jungle
, that darn cat
!
, flubber
,
and now mr
. magoo
. the best of these
( george of the jungle
) was mildly entertaining
. the worst
, mr
. magoo
, exposes just how painful a bad movei experience can be
. the first probelm with mr
. magoo is the script
. dispite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft
, mr
. magoo is comically barren
. from beginning to end
, there
' s not a laff to be found
. every attempt at humor
-
- anbd there are lots of them
-
- falls flat with an audible thud
. you
' d think that out of the dozens ofthe gags jammed into this film
, at least a few would work
,
but that
' s nto the case
. i
' ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures
. thne there
' s leslie nielsen
, who looks
, sounds
,
and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character
( memorably voiced by jim backus
)
. in the past
, nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane
and the naked gun
. lately
,
however
, he has beeen getting lazy
, taking parts in the likes of dracula
: dead
and loving it
, spy hard
,
and mr
. magoo
. even if nielsen was in top form
, it would tkae an incredible stretch ofthe immagination to see him as magoo
( especially since we
' re reminded ofthe the original by the short cartoon segments that open
and close the film
)
, bu
" top form
" is not a phrase i would uise to describe his performance here
. this is strictly a take
- the
- money
-
and
- run operation
. the story
, which
, like many disney stories
, can be described iin noe long sentence
: magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum
,
and
, as he is trying tothe apprehend the thieves on his own
, the police mistake him forthe the robber
. the cops are played by ernie hudson
and stephen tobolowsky
, who take their lumps early adn often
. the bad guys are kelly lynch
( who does a lot of martial arts
- type kicking
)
, nick chinlund
,
and malcolm mcdowell
( who has the good sense to look embarrassed
)
. matt keeslar portrays one of magoo
' s sidekicks
-
- his nephew
, waldo
. the bumbling man
' s other
, more interesting companion is a dog named angus
. most of mr
. magoo
' s humor comes in the form ofthe failed slapstick
. the cartoon voilence levle in this film doesn
' t aproach that of home alone 3 or flubber
,
but it
' s still pretty acute
, with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers
and knocked off snowy precipices
. ther
' s a non
- violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could hvea been funny if it wass h
andled better
,
but
, compared to mr
. bean
' s recent
, similar misadventure
, it doesn
' t hold up well
.
then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo
' s near blindness
, such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby
. i
' m willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack
. tong
, a hong kong film maker trying tothe break into the hollywood market
, has helmed several jackie chan movies
, including first strike
, rumble in the bronx
,
and supercop
. his chief talent
, tyhat of choreographing martial arts fights
, is wasted here
( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch
)
. like john woo
( hard target
)
and ringo lam
( maximum risk
) before him
, it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry inot the american mainstream
. it is worth noting that
, unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under
- 10 crowd while driving parents tothe distraction
, mr
. magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages
. tghe screening i attended was wall
- to
- wall kids
,
and
, for the most part
, they didn
' t seem tothe be enjoying themselves
. when the film was over
, i asked oney little girl what she
thought of it
. her pained expression confirmed thge adage thast a picture can indeed be worth a thous
and words
. mr
. magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer
, sight unseen
.
