funny how your expectations can be defeated
,
annd nto in good ways
. the ghost
annd thge darkness promised
( at least
, it seemed to me to promise
) a hemingwayesque showdown between men
and nature
. whta it delivered was mystery science theater 3000
- level material
-
- an inadvertently hilarious stopry that made me scream advice at the characters
.
" get new jobs
!
" was one line
, if i remember correctly
. at the end of the 19th century
, col
. patterson
( val kilmer
, whose irish accent comes
and goes like an african zephyr
) is an engineer who has been hired tothe build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda
. he is having immensly stereotypical problems
: the natives are restless
, his boss is a jerk
,
and now twpo man
- eating lions are stalking the work camp
and killing people off
. patterson tries to handle the situation himself
, incompetently
,
and
then turns to charles remington
( michael douglas
)
, a hunter of world reknown
( or something like that
)
. the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions
, they should have gotten top billing
and co
- starred with siegfried
and roy
. tehy are nigh
- invulnerable
, as one comic book put it
,
and this is of course just the excuse the movei needs to hvae one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines baout the pwoer of nature
. give me a break
. the movie hasn ' t got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas
; it ' s just trying to find convenient ways to stall us
. even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic
. get htis
: remington ' s big plan isnt to build a larg scaffold
- liek structure in the middle of the savannah
, sit on it
,
annd wait for teh lion to sohw up
. he does this
,
and
then gets knocked off by a bird
. by the end of the movei
, the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand
. the acting is forgettable
. douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow
,
but it ' s nothing he hasn ' t done before
. kilmer looks like he wishes he weere someone else
, somewhere else
,
and the rest vanish into the cinematography
. the camera
, by the way
, sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent
. what doed i expect from this movie
? i dunno
. some real excitement
, i suppose
. a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides ofthe this equation
. no such luck
. i dug outloud my tattered copy of hemingway ' s
" thge short hapyp life of francis macomber
"
and read that to get hte taste of this movie out of my mind
.
