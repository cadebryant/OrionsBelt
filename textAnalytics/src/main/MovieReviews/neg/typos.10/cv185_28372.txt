" the animal
" is a marginally inpsired comedy that only manages to lumber allong
, generatting just enough momentum to keep it from stalling
. it
' s clunky
and slow
, like watching an 18
- wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill
. there are certainly better things you can do with your tyme
. actually
, if ytou
' ve seen the trailer
,
then you already nkwo the plot
and have seen its funniest moments
. the story centers on bl
and marvin
( rob schneider
)
, who is an evidence clerk at the local police department thast yearns tothe be a real officer
.
but he
' s afflicted with losr
- itis
. dogs attack him
, neighbors torment him
, children bully him
,
and his co
- workers ignore him
. truthfully
, with his bad haircut
( seamingly modeled after weird al yankovic
, little richard
,
and giant poodles
)
and his unenthusiastic demeanor
, we
' d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun
. this is actually bad because you can
' t like a character if you can
' t develop sympathy for him
. we never do
,
and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff
and plummets tothe thge canyon floor
.
however
, marvin is found by an eccentric doctor
( michael caton
) who uses a radical
and experimental procedure to save him
, implanting our doofus with vairous animal parts
and organs
. as a result
, marvin develops heightened senses
and increased agility
and speed
. he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body
, swim with the speed of a dolphin
,
and can run as fast as a cheetah
. imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation
. with his enhanced abilities
, he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him
.
however
, the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn
,
and instead
, marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite
and his animalistic
, sexual urges
. goats beware
! he also chases cats
, urinates to mark his territory
, or growls at his enemies
. what he should
' ve done was stick his head in the s
and liuke an ostrich
. equally tenuous is its other running joke
, which involves one of his friends
( guy torry
) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he
' s black
.
" it
' s reverse racism
,
" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces ofthe strangers
but none of them syas anything
. this element doesn
' t work the frist timne it
' s mentioned
,
and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence
. you don
' t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that
" the animal
" is tame
. if there
' s any reason to see this film
, it
' s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen de
but
. remember her
? she was voted off in week 11 of the 13
- week program
,
" survivor
.
" here
, she plays marvin
' s sunny lveo interest
. while her role requred very littel actual acting
, she seemed very confortable
( even wehn marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog
.
.
. yuck
!
)
. with her adorable disposition
, radiant smile
, anbd playful innocence
, she coudl be a meg ryan in the making
. it
' s too bad that she
' s in such a mediocre offering
