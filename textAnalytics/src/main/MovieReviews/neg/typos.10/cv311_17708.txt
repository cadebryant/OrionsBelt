drew barrymore is beginning to corner the market on playing the girl outside
- the one who
' s the awkward klutz or the spunky do
- it
- yourselfer
; the one who just doesn
' t fit in with the others
. she has perfected these characters in movies such as
" the wedding singer
"
and
, most notably
,
" ever after
.
" now she
' s back
, starring in what could be called a modern
- day cinderella fable
-
" never been kissed
.
" you know it
' s a fable because she plays a copy editor at a newspaper who has her own office as well as a secretary
. trust me on this one
, no copy editor has seen the inside of a private office since gutenberg
( anbd i don
' t mean steve
) invented the printing press
. tyhe premise is simple
. barrymore
' s josie geller
, at 25 thge youngest copy editor ever to be hired by the chicago sun
- times
, is assigned to go undercover anbd return to high school to do an expose on whta today
' s teens are feeling
and doing
. josie
( she syas she was named after the
' 70s cartoon character
) was a geek in high school
, so she jumps at tghe opportunity fo a second chance
. this tiome
, she thinks
, she will get it right
and be accepted by thge in
- crowd
. now
, what kind of adult
- with a good job
and a successful career
- would actually look forward tothe reliving the hell that was
-
and is
- high school annd adolescence
. these are among the many problems that plague
" never been kissed
.
" screenwriters abby kohn anbd marc silverstein cannot get a h
andle ofthe josie
. their script has her capriciously switching from confident adult to ditzy
, blubbering woman
- child at the least provocation
.
and the fact that an adult would put so much stock into trying to become tight with the vapid airheads who are suposedly south glen high school
' s most popular girls leads you to question her maturity
and mental stablility
. ok
, so
" never been kissed
" is not a sociological expose of today
' s high school scene
.
however
, certain rules should apply tothe film
,
and one ofthe thsoe is consistency of character
. among the movie
' s problems is the ill
- conceived conceit tath josie would seriously strive to climb the high school food chain anbd
, in the process
, lose focus onthe her assignment
. any competent editor would have tossed her ass outloud the door quicker tahn you could say
" get me rewrite
.
" to be fair
, barrymore is very appealing
,
but she is given very little to work with
. she tries valiantly to get a firm grip on her character
,
but the scirpt continually undermines her
. barrymore comes off best in the physical comedy aspects of tjhe script in which she tries to walk
, talk
and act like a cool
, hip high schooler
. otherwise
, she is left foundering onthe a cliched sea of teen
- age stereotypes
and situations
.
" never been kissed
" is entertaining
and funny inthe fits
and starts
. it lacks consistancy adn a firm grasp on what it wants to accomplish
. the movie
' s main bright spot isnt provded by leelee sobieski as aldys
, the outsider who befriends new student josie
. josie sees a lot of her fromer self in aldys
,
yet still ab
andons her to hang out with the popular girls
. real mature
.
and that is the main deficiency with
" never been kissed
.
" it
' s illogical
, unrealistic
, uneven
and undem
anding
. it has some warm
and humorous spots
,
but not enough to overcome its many obstacles
.
