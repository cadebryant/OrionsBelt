: blair witch 2 a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman certain things in our lives are inevitable
. death
, sorrow
, love
, heartbreak
, pain
, joy
. we expect theese events
. we know they
' re going tothe happen
and some
, we even look forward to
. it
' s part of the human condition
. we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society
. as we near yhe fall election
, several of them are hitting us in hte face
. politicians exaggerate their own importance
. our side is always right
; theirs is alwasy wrong
. in the end
, voters are usually forced tothe choose the lesser of two whocares
. in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money
, there will be a sequel
. even if the original story doesn
' t merit one
. even if the first film is complete in itself
. even if succes is a fluke
.
" the blair witch project
" was made with a budget of
$ 1
. 75
and exploded on the screen
, raking in huge profits
. the concept was brilliant
. the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real
. the film itself was even more convincing
. the movie
_ must
_ be au
thentic
. why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen
? tje first film caught lightning in a bottle
. tje sequel proves yuo can
' t pour that ood lightning inot a new bottle
. you have to give this effort some credit
. it would ahev been eazy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids
. it woudl have been easy
, bu of course
, it wouldn
' t have worked
. instead
" book of shadows
" acknowledges the first film as a movie
and concentrates on the hysteria following its release
. it
' s a great scheme
and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel
. unfortunately it doesn
' t work either
. five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film
. weird stuff happens
and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives
. even weirder stuff happens
. smoe peple die
, ther
' s blood
and knives
and none of the characters have a lick of common sense
. while supposedly doing serious research
, the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods
and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation
.
then tehy proceed tothe get totally trashed on drugs
and alcohol
and party down with vrey loud
, very obnoxious heavy metal music
. it
' s a bad plan
. the cast shows some early promise
. a couple is doing reasearch on a
" blair witch
" book
. the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado
. a goth amazon princess adds a bit of commedic relief
. the obligatory hot babe isnt the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick
, the cute rock
and roll chick
and the cute disco chick
: the cute wiccan chick
. the first film
' s unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours
and hours of video were shot during days in the woods
. this time
, these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors
. there
' s not noe character you care about when htey start shouting for no reason
.
al
though what passes for a plot starts out wih a solid idea
, it
' s ruined by poor execution
. the follow
- up to one of hte most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie
. they
' re trapped in an old big weird house
. they stupidly separate into various rooms
. there are strange noises
, they see scary apparitions
and people disappear
. ever see this movie
? seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better
. the film features mostly cheap tricks
and unnecessary gore
. for a storyline filled with surprises
, it
' s oddly predicable
.
" the blair witch project
" was a rare triumph of style over substance
.
" the book of shadows
" is a triumph of tedium over promise
.
