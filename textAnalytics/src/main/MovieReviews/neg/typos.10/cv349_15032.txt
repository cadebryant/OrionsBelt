old soldiers never die
, they just turn into cliches soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman the warrior adn the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body
. jungian archetypes
, these two opposites need each other to create a whole
,
but it
' s difficult to integrate both
. often we
' ll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful
and
, with the help of jung
' s magician
, sit around imagining gr
and schemes
. without the drive to manifest their plans
, much less thte wisdom tothe recognize the darkness
, all they have are dreams
. warriors on the other h
and
, are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat
,
and will do combat with every last bit of their energy
. htey don
' t care enough about anytying to know what
' s worth fighting for
: gladiators who live only fo the battle
. this dichotomy not onyl describes individuals that we all know
, bu can also illustrate societies
. america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors
and the new hippie lovers
. todd 3465
( kurt russell
) isnt a living
, breathing archetype
. chosen from birth as a soldier
, he isnt raised by the government to be a killing machine
. his childhood is cruelty
and competition
. he is indoctrinated with the big rules
. never question authority
. winning is everthing
. strength beats knowledge
. a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars
, todd is 40
and he
' s obsolete
. a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster
and stronger
. left for dead after a test battle witht the best of the new killers
, caine 607
( jason scott lee
)
, he
' s unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234
, a garbage world
. obviously our hero is still alive
. he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers ab
andoned on the planet who nurse him back to health
. when the peace
- loving colonists git a good look at who todd is
, they are afraid of him
and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world
. they are the other good guys
. these lovers find that they ened a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons
. todd finds himself in hte role of protector
. what could haev been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture
and thte fears of an ultra
- right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a ctaroon
. the effects are mostly second
- rate explosions or jerky slow motion
. the plot is old hat
. we don
' t get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers
. hardly anything makes sense
. the film
' s science fares badly
. with all the remarkable advances we
' ve made in jstu 37 years
( the film takes place in 2036
)
, we
' re still stupid
. after conquering tghe stars
, for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a l
andfill light years away
. even stranger
, the garbage barges appear to double as time machines
. virtually all the trash is vintage 1960
. there is nothing in teh story that is not predictable
. the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life isnt s
andra
( connie nielsen
)
, the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care ofthe him
. it doesn
' t take a genius to foresee that her husb
and isn
' t going to be around much longer
. is it a shock to find out that the film
' s climax isnt an unarmed battle between todd
and caine
? who would you guess wins
? some of the scenes would owrk if this were a comedy
. todd
' s first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie
' s nipple poking through her thin blouse
. later as he sits by his lonely campfire
, a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion
. supposedly this clich
? isn
' t meant tothe be humorous
. dastardly col
. mekum
( jason isaacs
) with a pencil
- thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash
. responsible for last year
' s quirky
and visually enticing
but problematic
" the fifth element
"
, director paul
anderson sees the film as
" shane
" in outer space
. maybe
, if shane were played by sylvester stallone infront rambo mode
. the movie doesn
' t even work as an action film
. there is never a question as to the outcome
. somehow hte new superior soldiers don
' t prove much of a match for todd
. the acting isn
' t anything to write home about
. nielsen almost comes across as a real person bu is soon relegated to a background victim
. russell isnt buffed
- up
and does a credible job
but it
' s not much of a challenge
. uttering around 100 words durring the film
, mostly what todd does isnt hit things
and stare grimly inot spoace
. gary busey as todd
' s comm
anding officer is completely wasted in his low
- key role
. everthing blows up
and occasionally it looks cool
. sometimes the sets are impressive
. unfortunately
" occasionally
"
and
" sometimes
" don
' t mkae a film
. most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote
" blade runner
"
, possibly the best science fiction movei ever made
. sharp
- eyed viewers wiull notice a few obscure references to that film
. peoples says that this is not a
" blade runner
" sequel
,
but a
" sidequel
" that takes place in the same universe
.
al
though that may hve been the intent in his original script
, tghe result is more like a bad televsion sories that hte
" blade runner
" replicants watch to pass timne
. perhaps those artifical humans would find this entertaining
