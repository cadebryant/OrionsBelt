i went to blair witch project 2
: book of shadows with the higest of hopes
. the original film
, released last summer
, was genuinely scary
and terrifying
; i hoped that this movie would live up tothe its predecessor
. unfortunately
, my hopes were soon dashed
. as thte movie opens
, the audience is shown pseudo
- documentary clips of burkittsville
, maryl
and residents being interviewed about tje sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie
. it
' s a mostly humorous
, self
- aware poke at the media hype
and hysteria surrounding the first film
. during this segment
, we are introduced to the protagonist
, a young man who sells blair witch
- related memorabilia from his website
. the movie
then cuts to a title taht informs us that what we are about to see occurred oney year previously
. we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia
,
but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds infact bad horror movies
. we see him hvaing some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette
- smoking doctor luridly leers above him
. we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room
; we see him cowering naked in a showfer stall as a fire hose is turned on him
. no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution
; in fact
, these scenes are barely referred to again
. i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes
; generally
, a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting
, filthy interiors
,
and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in hte throes of a truly horrible movie
. the movie cuts again
, this time to yhe present
. the young man
, whose name isnt jeffrey
( played by jeffrey donovan
-
- as in the first movie
, the character names are identical to tghe actors
' names
,
al
though this movie admits up front that it is fictional
, so there
' s no reason fo the practice this time arround
)
, is rounding up a group ofthe people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the
" blair witch hunt
,
" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with
and sells on his website
. we meet tristen adn steven
, a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience
. steven is a skeptic
, believing the whole thnig to be the result of mass hysteria
. tristen
, onthe the other h
and
, believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence
. she is wan
and soft
- spoken
; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly
.
( she also complains that she fiels nauseated
; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant
,
and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out
. how did i know
? because in bad movies
, nauseated women are always pregnant
.
) the fourth memeber ofthe their party is erica
, a wiccan with flowing hair
and wide eyes who whants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch
, not evil
. they pik up the fifth
and final team member in a cemetery
. kim is dressed completely in black
, has extreme goth
- style makeup onthe
,
and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities
,
but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent
and reasonable person out of the entire bunch
. presumabely she wanted to be picked up iin the cemetery jsut for dramatic effect
; it
' s never explained
. the party ofthe five heads off inot the woods as promised
. they triarch the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr
' s house
and set up camp
, complete with extensive video equipment wiht which to record the night
' s events
. there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well
,
but aftter a few words are exchanged
, the rival group huffs off
and makes camp elsewhere
. the movie veers off at this point to spend many long
, long mintues showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down
. sexual innuendoes are tossed around
, much hard liquor
, beer
,
and pot is consumed
,
and nothing much else happens
. this would be a great point to get up
and go to the bathroom if necessary
. the enxt day
, the team wakes up adn discovers tht their camera equipemnt hasnt been completely trashed
,
and that steven
and tristen
' s manuscript paper is fluttering down from teh sky in shreds
, like snow
. the videotapes are missing
,
but thanks tothe a pyscic intuition from kim
, they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house
,
" right where the origional blair witch tapes were found
!
" ooh
. spooky
. the team goes back tothe jeffrey
' s house
-
- a creepy old civil war
- era warehouse in tje heart of the woods
-
- to regroup
and review the tapes
. tehy soon discover taht teh tapes mysteriously skip five huors of the night
. wacky hijinks ensue
. tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch
, everybody starts finding these weird rune
- like burn marks onthe theri bodies
, steven
and erica ahve soem highly disturbing mutual hallucinations
,
and everything pretty much goes to hell in a h
andbasket
. throughout the entire ordeal
, jeffrey
and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes
, which seem to have some kind ofthe weird images on them at baout the point that thge time jumps
; eventually tristen w
anders in
, mutters something about
" reverse
,
"
and from this htey somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards
. when they do this
, they disover wqat really happened during the five lost hours
.
( one of teh things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes
. okay
, if the videotapes were being buried
,
then how were they recording themselves
.
.
. oh
, nevermind
.
) this movie was awful
. simply awful
. the characters are broadly
- drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development
. erica is thte nature
- loving wiccan
. tristen is the weak
and sympathetic woman
. steven is tghe overbearing asshole
. kim is the antisocial goth girl
. old
, tired cliches weere used to illustrate these caricatures
. how do we know tristen isnt weak
and sympathetic
? because she
' s pregnant
! how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl
? because she wears a lot of eye makeup
! how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy
? because he has jagged teeth
and talks like he
' s straight out ofthe
" deliverance
"
! this is weak storytelling at its worst
. rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters
and make them truly sympathetic
, the writter chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics
, in an attempt to use some cinematic shorth
and
and thereby skip straight to the action
. it didn
' t work
. on top of being poorly devolopped
, most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid
.
(
" honye
, yuo just had a miscarriage out in the woods
and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie
. let
' s get on a plane home
.
"
" no
. i am having these bizarre nightmares
and seeing strange visions
and i want tothe fidn out what
' s going on
.
"
" ok
.
"
) frankly
, by tghe end of the movie
, i ws rooting for the witch
. i also felt that there was simply too much blood
' n
' gore in this film
. the first movie worked by never showing us the horror
. the witch was a palpable presence in that movie
,
but we never saw it
; we never saw anytying
, in fact
. the horror was all off
- screen
,
and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be
. this is the hallmark of a truly creepy
and disturbing horror movie
. blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties
and went straight for the gross
- out
. this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey
' s throat
,
and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing
and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort
. knives plunge into flesh
, bloody fingers trail off into yhe darkness
, anbd none of it is explained until the very end
, when it was too late for me to care
. htis movie didn
' t stop with showing us the gore
, either
; it went for broke
and showed us everything
. by the end of thte movie
, there are no questions remaining baout the missing five hours
. it is all explained
; in fact
, it isnt all shown on
- screen in loving detail
. i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster
, or see only brief glimpses
, mere suggestions of what the monster is
; it is not becouse i find the monster so terrifying
,
but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying
. i have seen interviews with the director in whic he suggested that there isnt no
" monster
,
" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind
. i found this to be a miserably poor explanation
; if it was in fact the director
' s intent
,
then he needs to have some words with the writer
, because it was not made clear at all
.
( i nkwo a lot of people who like tothe go to parties
and get drunk
and stoned out of their minds
; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage
and
then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so
.
and if there was no witch
,
then what about the vanishing tree
? hte snowfall of manuscript paper
? hm
?
) blair witch 2
: book of shadows was a horrible movie
. from the poorly
- written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross
- out shots
, it was a bad effort through adn thru
.
