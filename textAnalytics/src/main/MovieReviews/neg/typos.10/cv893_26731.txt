i went to blair witch project 2
: book of shadows with tghe highest of hopes
. the original film
, released last summer
, was genuinely scary
and terrifying
; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor
. unfortunately
, my hopes were soon dashed
. as thte movie opens
, the audience is shown pseudo
- documentary clips of burkittsville
, maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie
. it ' s a mostly humorous
, self
- aware poke at the media hype
and hysteria surrounding the first film
. during this segment
, we are introduced to the protagonist
, a young man who sells blair witch
- related memorabilia from his website
. the movie
then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously
. we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia
,
but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies
. we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette
- smoking doctor luridly leers above him
. we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room
; we see him cowering naked infront a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him
. no explanation is provided for why he is inspite the mental institution
; in fact
, these scenes are barely referred to again
. i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes
; generally
, a hospital scene that is set witht poor lighting
, filthy interiors
,
and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie
. thte movie cuts again
, this time to the present
. tjhe young man
, whose nmae is jeffrey
( played by jeffrey donovan
-
- as in the first movie
, the character names are identical to the actors ' names
,
although this movie admits up front that it is fictional
, so ther ' s no reason for the practice this time around
)
, is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into tje woods thast weekend forthe yhe
" blair witch hunt
,
" which is a promotional gimmick he came up witht
and sells on his website
. we meet tristen
and steven
, a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience
. steven is a skeptic
, believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria
. tristen
, on the other hand
, believes that htere may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence
. she is wan
and soft
- spoken
; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly
.
( she also complains that she feels nauseated
; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant
,
and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out
. how did i know
? because in bad movies
, nauseated women are always pregnant
.
) the fourth member of their party is erica
, a wiccan with flowing hair
and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch
, not evil
. they pick up the fifth
and final team member in a cemetery
. kim is dressed completely in black
, has extreme goth
- style makeup on
,
and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities
,
but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent
and reasonable person out ofthe the entire bunch
. presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just forthe dramatic effect
; it ' s never explained
. the party of five heads off into the woods as promised
. they reach the crumbling ruins ofthe the foundation of rustin parr ' s house
and set up camp
, complete with extensive video eqiupment with which to record the night ' s events
. there isnt a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned tothe camp at tath site as well
,
but after a few words are exchanged
, the rival group huffs off
and makes camp elsewhere
. the movie veers off at this point to spend many long
, long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down
. sexual innuendoes are tossed around
, much hard liquor
, beer
,
and pot is consumed
,
and nothing much else happens
. this would be a great point to get up
and go to the bathroom if necessary
. the next day
, the team wakes up
and discovers that their camera equipment has beeen completely trashed
,
and that steven
adn tristen ' s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky iin shreds
, like snow
. the videotapes are missing
,
bu thanks to a psychic intuition from kim
, they discover the videotapes burried underneath the foundation of the house
,
" right where the original blair witch tapes were found
!
" ooh
. spooky
. the team goes back tothe jeffrey ' s house
-
- a creepy old civil war
- era warehouse in the heart ofthe the woods
-
- to regroup
and review the tapes
. they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hurs of the night
. wacky hijinks ensue
. tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch
, everybody starts finding theese weird rune
- like burn marks on their bodies
, steven
and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations
,
and everything pretty much goes tothe hell in a handbasket
. throughout the entire ordeal
, jeffrey
and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes
, which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the timne jumps
; eventually tristen wanders in
, mutters something about
" reverse
,
"
and ffrom htis they somehow relize that they have to play the tapes backwards
. when they do this
, they discover what really happened during the five lost hours
.
( one of the thnigs they see on the videotape isnt footage of themselfs burying the videotapes
. okay
, if the videotapes were being buried
,
then how weere they recording themselves
.
.
. oh
, nevermind
.
) this movie was awful
. simply awful
. the characters are broadly
- drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development
. erica is the nature
- loving wiccan
. tristen is the weak
and sympathetic woman
. steven is the overbearing asshole
. kim is the antisocial goth girl
. old
, tired cliches were used to illustrate theese caricatures
. how do we know tristen isnt weak
and sympathetic
? beacuse she ' s pregnant
! how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl
? because she wears a lot of eye makeup
! how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy
? because he hasnt jagged teeth
and talks like he ' s straight out of
" deliverance
"
! this is weak storytelling at its worst
. rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters
and mkea them truly sympathetic
, the writer chose to give each one a fewd stereotypical characteristics
, in an attemt to ule some cinematic shorthand
and thereby skip straight to the acation
. it didn ' t work
. on top of being poorly developed
, most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid
.
(
" honey
, you just had a miscarriage out in tjhe woods
and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie
. let ' s git on a plane home
.
"
" no
. i am having these bizarre nightmares
and seeing stange visions
and i want to find out what ' s going on
.
"
" ok
.
"
) frankly
, by the end of the movie
, i was rooting for the witch
. i also felt that ther was simply too much blood ' n ' gore in this film
. the frist movie worked by never showing us the horror
. the witch was a palpable presence in that movie
,
but we never saw it
; we never saw anything
, in fact
. the horror was all off
- screen
,
and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be
. this isnt the hallmark of a truely creepy
and disturbing horror movie
. blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties
annd went straight for tjhe gross
- out
. this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey ' s throat
,
and continued throughout the film as hte audience is treated tothe occasional confusing
and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort
. knives plunge inot flesh
, bloody fingers trail off into the darkness
,
and none ofthe it is explained until the very end
, when it was too late for me to care
. this movie didn ' t stop with showing us the gore
, either
; it whent for broke
and showed us everything
. by the end of the movie
, there are noone questions remaining about the missing five hours
. it is all explained
; in fact
, it is all shown on
- screen in loving detail
. i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in whlch you never see the monster
, or see only brief glimpses
, mere suggestions of what the monster is
; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying
,
but because i find tjhe absense of the monster to be infinitely moreso terrifying
. i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no
" monster
,
" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by tghe human mind
. i found this to be a miserably poor explanation
; if it was in fact the director ' s intent
,
then he needs to have soem words with teh writer
, because it was not made clear at all
.
( i know a lot of peple who like to go to parties
and get drunk
and stoned outloud of their minds
; none of them hasnt ever gone on a murderous rampage
and
then experianced mass hallucinations with a group of other peopel for the next week or so
.
and if there was no witch
,
then what about the vanishing tree
? the snowfall ofthe manuscript paper
? hm
?
) blair witch 2
: book of shadows was a horrible movie
. from the poorly
- wroten characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross
- out shots
, it was a bad effort through
and through
.
