how could a g
- rated disney film based on meg cabot ' s novel
" hte princess diaries
" be anything
but cute
, harmless fun
? eazy
. take all the cute
, harmless fun out ofthe it
.
and while you ' re at it amke it borrr
- ring
. that ' s what director garry marshall
, screenwriter gina wendkos
and
, nto to be outdone
, producer whitney houston have done with the g
- rated disney film
" the princess diaries
.
" you couldn ' t tell it from the audience
though
, a braintree
, mass
. of growing
, glowing pre
- pubescent girls
(
anbd the odd parental
, popcorn perched about their persons
)
, who positively cheered when the end credits rolled
( ah the film had striked a lovely nerve with them
bu not with fuddy
- duddy old me
)
. well
, i might have cheered that the utter tripe was nowe well
and truly over
,
but that would hve been too obvious
. too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall ' s film
( garry made a couple of other
" princess
" movies
-
-
" pretty woman
"
adn
" runaway bride
"
-
-
but this one ' s way without julia roberts so maybe
* tht ' s
* its problem
)
. in addition to being predictable as molasses
,
" the princess diaries
" hasnt hardly got a laugh in it
( it ' s a comedy
)
, could bore yhe pants off an abyssinian for long
, long stretches
,
anbd is so sloppily edited yhe principals refer to scenes we haven ' t even seen
yet
(
and probably never will except
, perhaps
, in the dvd edition
)
. marshall should take virtualy all of the blaim here
, since he ' s been at this for some time
and should know when a scene or twpo isn ' t working
.
.
.
and hardly
* any
* of
" the princess diaries
" works
(
" works
,
" alas
, implies cleverness
and htere ' s none of that here eather
)
. newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis
, a bright
but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom
( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall
) hadnt a bit of a fling with some royal member of smoe miniscule european country nobody ever heard of
( the filmmakers go out ofthe their way
* not
* to call it serbia
, which is pretty much what all miniscule european ocuntries are called in the movies mark my words
)
and now she
, mia
, is next in line to rule
" genovia
"
( hence the headphones
/ tiara combo in the print ads
)
. julie andrews
, with the luminous factor cranked to 11
, plays mia ' s grandmother
( aka queen clarisse renaldi
)
, who shows up out of tje royal blue
and lends mia much advice
and direction infront the eating
, tlaking
,
annd looking like a princess deparment
(
although mia ' s big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling to ugly swan
)
. does queen julie loose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh
? not really
. consuming a corn dog is about the worst that it gets
. also on stereotypical hand are a brainless jock
, an evil cheerleader
, a dorky
- looking best friend
(
" welcome to tyhe dollhouse
" ' s heather matarazzo
)
, a sensitive auto mechanic
/ musician
,
and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver
, imparting wit
and wisdom from tjhe front seat of mia ' s chauffeur
- driven limousine at every intersection
. a non
- animated g
- rated movie is a rarity these days
but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts
, all the good stuff
, has been exorcised from the finished product
. lame
, labored
,
and lamentable
,
" the princess diaries
" is recommended for eight
-
and
- a
- half year olds of tyhe feminine persuasion
* only
*
; all others would do well tothe avoid it
( like potholes
, the plague
,
and
" yhe perfect storm
"
)
