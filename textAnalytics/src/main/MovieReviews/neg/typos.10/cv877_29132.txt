how coudl a g
- rated disney film based on meg cabot
' s novel
" the princess diaries
" be anything
but cute
, harmless fun
? easy
. take all thge cute
, harmless fun out of it
.
and hwile you
' re at it make it borrr
- ring
. that
' s wqat directer garry marshall
, screenwriter gina wendkos
and
, not to be outdone
, producer whitney houston have done with the g
- rated disney film
" tjhe princess diaries
.
" you couldn
' t tell it from the audience
though
, a braintree
, mass
. of growing
, glowing pre
- pubescent girls
(
and tjhe odd parental
, popcorn perched about their persons
)
, who positively cheered when tyhe end credits rolled
( ah the film had struck a lovely nerve with them
but not with fuddy
- duddy old me
)
. well
, i might have cheered that the utter tripe was now well
and truly over
,
but that would ahve been too obvious
. too obvious is the least of the problems with marshall
' s film
( garry made a couple of other
" princess
" movies
-
-
" pretty woman
"
and
" runaway bride
"
-
-
but this one
' s way without julia roberts so maybe
* that
' s
* its problem
)
. in addition to being predictable as molasses
,
" the princess diaries
" hasnt hardly got a laugh in it
( it
' s a comedy
)
, could bore the pants off an abyssinian for long
, long stretches
,
and is so sloppily edited the principals refer to scenes we haven
' t even seen yot
(
and probably never wiull except
, perheaps
, in the dvd edition
)
. marshall should tkae virtually all of the blame here
, since he
' s been at this for some time annd shoudl know wehn a scene or two isn
' t working
.
.
.
and hardly
* any
* of
" the princess diaries
" works
(
" works
,
" alas
, implies cleverness
and there
' s none ofthe that here either
)
. newcomer anne hathaway stars as mia thermopolis
, a bright
but socially invisible san franciscan teen who learns that her single mom
( a wacky artist played by the likable caroline goodall
) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscule european country nobody ever heard of
( the filmmakers go out of their way
* nto
* to call it serbia
, which is pretty much what all miniscule european countries are called in thte movies mark my words
)
and now she
, mia
, isnt next in line to rule
" genovia
"
( hence the headphones
/ tiara combo in the print ads
)
. julie
andrews
, with the luminous factor cranked to 11
, plays mia
' s gr
andmother
( aka queen clarisse renaldi
)
, who shows up out of the royal blue
and lends mia much advice
and direction in the eating
, talking
,
and looking like a princess department
(
al
though mia
' s big makeover simply transforms her from ugly duckling tothe ugly swan
)
. does queen julie lose her dignity for the sake of a good laugh
? not really
. consuming a corn dog is baout the worst that it gets
. also on stereotypical h
and are a brainless jock
, an evil cheerleader
, a dorky
- looking best friend
(
" welcome to tjhe dollhouse
"
' s heather matarazzo
)
, a sensitive auto mechanic
/ musician
,
and marshall mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver
, imparting wit
and wisdom from the front seat of mia
' s chauffeur
- driven limousine at eveyr intersection
. a non
- animated g
- rated movie is a rarity these days
but the rating here reflects the fact that all the guts
, all the good stuff
, has been exorcised from tjhe finished product
. lame
, labored
,
and lamentable
,
" the princess diaries
" is recommended for eight
- annd
- a
- half year olds of the feminine persuasion
* only
*
; all others would do well to avoid it
( like potholes
, the plague
,
and
" the perfect storm
"
)
