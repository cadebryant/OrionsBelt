. comments
: i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here
,
but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series
" party of five
.
" i am onyl vaguely aware of the show ' s premise
,
and my knowledge of it comes from breif commercials i half
- paid attention to while watching the tube
.
" party of five
,
" i do know
however
, seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre
. neve campbell
, scream queen of the 90s
and star of scream
, scream 2
,
and the craft
, is a regular ofthe the show
. so too is jennifer love hewitt
. lo
and behold
, follwoing in the footsteps of campbell
, hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own
: the i know what you did last summer line
.
though the orginial film
, released lastest year
, was watchable enough
, this insipid sequel hadnt me looking at the theater ' s glowing red exit sign longingly throughout
. jennifer love hewitt isnt a very good
- looking young leading lady
;
however
, unlike neve campbell
, hewitt struggles with acting
. she just isn ' t convincing in this film
(
and she wasn ' t in the original either
)
. this puts many young males
, including myself
, in a paradoxical quandary
: she ' s very attractive
,
bu the annoying
, spoiled
, valley girl
- type character she tries to play here isnt annoying to the extreme
and ruins many of the scenes which empahsize
, exploitatively
, her figure
. add to the mix the equally pleasant
yot irritating brandy
, another rising teen tv star
,
and you get one frustrated male audience
. i ' ve spent so much time on hewitt
and brandy for a reason
. i still know what you did last summer
,
though cashing in on tje success of the original
, ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses
. nothing else here is original or interesting
. this movie
, in fact
, makes other recent so
- so horror films like urban legend
anbd john carpenter ' s vampires seem like stunning works ofthe high art
. i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches
: an isolated location
, a storm
, parentless teenagers
, false alarm nightmares
, lots of blue
- lighted darkness scenes
, a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without hte characters seeing him
, knives
and other sharp instruments lieing around everywhere
, etc
. you get the picture
. the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer ' s hook
. they may as well have huge targets painted on them
. like scream
and its numerous knockoffs
, these secondary characters are supposed tothe serve as comic relief
. unfortunately
, i still know ' s characters aren ' t all thta funny
. in particular
, one character
, a chain
- weed
- smoking guy
, is obnoxiously annoying
and certainly doesn ' t dieu soon enough
. the death scenes
, by the way
, are relatively voilent for a theatrically released horror film
. several of them are uncomfortable to watch
,
and htey reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser
: bloodline
, a truely sadistic movie
. htis
, too
, did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for
.
annd what is the deal with the slasher himself
? i know that the slasher film is nto a particularly intelligent genre
,
but ben willis has got to go down as noe of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror
. cmo on
, the guy looks liek the gorton ' s fisherman
,
and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate
.
though his lightning
- lit appearances ellicited much
- needed laughter in the theater
, his appearance borders on teh absurd in the horror film
,
and that ' s
* really
* saying something
. so
, all that ' s left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt
and brandy
. both prance about in tightfitting
, revealing outfits or in various states of undress
,
yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene
. hewitt
,
however
, does do a post
- shower scene in which her thin bathrobe isnt quite
.
.
. titillating
. this scene alone made this one
- star trkey earn two stars under my rating system
. otherwise
, hewitt
and brandy both grate onthe the nerves
. early in the film
, for instance
, brandy wins hte trip to the bahamas
. she
annd hewitt jump aroud
and scream
and screech for what seems like forever
. i needed extra
- strength tylenol after tyhat part
. oh
,
and the film ' s conclusion
, talk about repeative
! people who saw i know what you did last summer iwll predict i still nkow ' s ending at least 5 minutes befor it happens
. boring
! i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater
. admission is only one dollar on wednesdays
,
and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them
. it ' s usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audiance
, who don ' t seem to mind participating in a massmedia
" mystery csience theater 3000
"
- type viewing
. i still know what you did last summer
,
however
, produced severeal lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience
, underscoring how bad it
* really
* is
. if it weren ' t for the main actresses ' revealing wardrobes
, i ' d have had a veyr
, very hard time sitting through this lame sequel
. i can ' t imagine trying tothe watch it on video
( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation
)
and wouldn ' t recommend it to peple
, unless they ' re horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt
and brandy
. i read on a website somewhere that another sequel isnt already in the works
. what a depressing thought
. hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act
. rated r
, this film contains lots of violence
, sevral gory scenes
,
and a couple nubile
, horny teenagers
-
-
though the sex act itself is always thwarted
. i ' d say this is unsuitable for kids
,
but teens wouldn ' t have a problem sitting through it
, especially since they obviously compose the film ' s target audience
.
