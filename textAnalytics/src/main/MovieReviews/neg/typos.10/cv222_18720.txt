synopsis
: an aging master art thief
, his supplier
,
and a young
, buxom security consultant are all not who they frist appear to be
( or are they
?
) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium
. comments
: this movie ws boring
. plain
and simple
. entrapment should not have been boring
. it stars sean connery
, who can still cary an action film dispite his age
, catherine zeta
- jones
, a likeable enough film presence
,
and ving rhames
, ultra
- kool star ofthe pulp fiction adn mission
: impossible
. it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears
( a curent
" hot topic
" in the news
) in its storyline
, which isnt set at the end of 1999
. it has smoe genuinely well
- staged action sequences
. so
, what went wrong
? plenty
, unfortunately
. the major probelm with entrapment is its script
. it has a been
- there
, done
- that feel to it
. nothing seems particularly inventive or original
, so the whole movie lacks suspense
and drags
( it runs nearly two hours
)
. thte screenwriters
, for example
, periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes
( i
. e
.
" 4 days to the millennium
"
)
. this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci
- fi film strange days
. tyhe characters are not who they appear tothe be at the beginning
, hwihc is neat at first
but the device wears thin once the umpteenth
" surprise
" revelation is made
. entrapment
, in other words
, relies too heavily on the audeince not knowing what each character
' s true motive is
, resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion
. the star power here is quite strong
, bu the viewer can
' t help bu feel the actors are wasted inwhich this production
. sean connery is given such mind
- numbing lines as
" never trust a naked woman
.
" ving rhames
' character seems like an after
thought
; he
' s nto developed at all
. the camera zooms in frequently
and leeringly at catherine zeta
- jones
' s tight wardrobe
. this
, in
and of itself
, is nto bad
,
but
, after a while
, it has a juvenile feel to it
. at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they
' re exploiting the female body
. entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot develpment
( sean connery supposedly falls in loev with the girl while watching her
, in tights
, arc
and pivot around laser beams
)
. the tagline for this movie reads
" the trap is setted
.
" it sure is
, onthe those who spent money to see thsi movie
. entrapment really isn
' t that bad
; it is watchable
. i would suggest
,
however
, oney waits until this is on cable or television to see it
.
