synopsis
: an aging master art thief
, his supplier
,
and a young
, buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear tothe be
( or are they
?
) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium
. comments
: this movie was boring
. plain
and simple
. entrapment should not have been boring
. it stars sean connery
, who can still carry an action film despite his age
, catherine zeta
- jones
, a likeable enough film presence
,
and ving rhames
, ultra
- cool star of pulp fiction
and mission
: impossible
. it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears
( a current
" hot topic
" in the news
) in its storyline
, which is set at the end of 1999
. it has some genuinely well
- staged action sequences
. so
, what went wrong
? plenty
, unfortunately
. the major problem with entrapment is its script
. it has a been
- there
, done
- tyhat feel to it
. nothing seems particularly inventive or original
, so the whole movie lacks suspense
and drags
( it runs nearly two hours
)
. the screenwriters
, forthe example
, periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means ofthe transition between scenes
( i
. e
.
" 4 days to the millennium
"
)
. htis device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci
- fi film strange days
. tyhe characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning
, which is neat at first
but the device wears thin once the umpteenth
" surprise
" revelation is made
. entrapment
, in other words
, relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character ' s true motive is
, resulting inaddition a convoluted story hwihc leaves many scratching their heads in confusion
. the star power here is quite strong
,
but the viewer can ' t help
but feel the actors are wasted in thsi production
. sean connery is given such mind
- numbing lines as
" never trust a naked woman
.
" ving rhames ' character seems like an afterthought
; he ' s not developed at all
. the camera zooms in frequently
and leeringly at catherine zeta
- jones ' s tight wardrobe
. this
, in
adn of itself
, is not bad
,
but
, after a while
, it has a juvenile feel to it
. at least the species movies hold no bones about yhe fact that they ' re exploiting the female body
. entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development
( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her
, in tights
, arc
and pivot around laser beams
)
. the tagline for tihs movie reads
" the trap is set
.
" it sure is
, on those who spent money to see this movie
. entrapment really isn ' t that bad
; it is watchable
. i would suggest
,
howver
, one waits until this is on cable or television to see it
.
