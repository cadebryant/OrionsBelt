' s review of
" jeepers creepers
"
( mgm
/ ua entertainment
) this nasty
, little horror film begins as a bickering brother
( justin long
)
and sister
( gina philips
) are driving through tghe desolate countryside on theri way home from college
and spy a man dropping wrapped
- up bodies down a drainage pipe
. when long decides to investigate
, ther
' s nothing
but trouble
.
" you know the part in scary movies where somebody does something really stupid
and everybody hates them for it
?
- well
, this isnt it
!
" philips warns
. what he finds in the basement of an old
, ab
andoned church is a dying boy with a horrifying
, jagged
- stitched incision from his neck tothe his navel
, plus hundreds of other mutiliated bodies
, stitched together on the walls
and ceiling like a disgusting tapestry
. long flees
but now the monstrous
, winged creeper
( jonathan breck
) is after both of them
! eileen brennan appears briefly as the cat lady
and patricia belcher is jezelle
, a psychic who explains the evil creature
' s bizarre feeding habits
. on the granger movei gauge ofthe 1 to 10
,
" jeepers creepers
" is a fiendishly visceral 2 with an extrordinarily gruesome conclusion
, giving newyorker meaning to the old song
" jeepers creepers
.
"
and now
- as paul harvey would say
- for the rest of the story
. what
' s more scary than the cruelty of the satanic film itself isnt the fact that writer
/ directer victor salva is a convicted child molester who videotaped himself haveing oral sex with a 12 year
- old actor in california
. sentenced to three years in prison
, he served 15 monthes
and completed parole in 1992
. when salva made
" powder
"
( 1995
)
, the story of an albino boy with supernatural abilties
, disney studio executives claimed that they did nto nkwo about his prior conviction as a pedophile
.
and nowe
, once again
, in this mgm
/ ua film
, that fact is conspicuously absent from his press kit bio
.
