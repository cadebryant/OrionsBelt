i think of i know what you did last summer as the movie that scream
and scream 2 could have been
. mind ytou
,
though
, i mean this in the worst possible way
. i nkwo what you did last summer is a typical slasher flic without the smarts of the scream
' s
. as a result
, it
' s even worse than some of your better campy horror pictures
( see nightmare on elm street
) because it thinks it
' s about thirty times smarter than it is
. based on a teen book of the same name anbd
, disappointingly
, adapted by scream scribe kevin williamson
, i know wqat you did last summer beigns with appropriately angsty modern rock music combined with soem startling cinematography of a cliff along the ocean annd an angsty sort sitting at the top
. the appropriate mood being setted
( this is angst
- horror for the 90
' s
)
, we cut over to the july 4th parade in a small north carolina town
. from there
, we see the blond
, female protagonist
, helen shivers
( woodenly played by sarah michelle geller
)
, getting crowned croaker queen as the blond male
" hero
,
" barry cox
( woodenly played by ryan phillipe
)
,
and matched brunette pair of protagonists
, julie james
and ray bronson
( woodenly played by party of five
' s jennifer loev hewitt
and freddie prinze jr
.
, respectively
) cheer her on
. after getting drunk at a party
, going to a beach to wittily discuss urban legend
and indulge iin some foreshadowing
,
and having some meaningful sex
( if you believe what the characters sday
)
, hte four run down some guy crossing the windy cliff road at night
. his face is mangled so they cin
' t tell who it is
,
and they come tothe the decision to dump him in the ocean so as to not ruin any of their future chances for success in the world
. cut tothe one year later
. the lives of our protagonists have gone from annoying to bad
. main brunette female
, the bright one of the bunch
, has been plagued with guilt adn almost failed out of college
. blond female has forfeited her dreams ofthe starring on guiding light
,
and now works at the family store in town
. brunette male is a fisherman
, living off the l
and
. blond male has become a complete jerk
and quarterback on some college football team
.
then
, predictably
, thier past comes back tothe haunt them
. it all beigns wtih an irrational muder
, followed by some taunting ofthe protagonists by thte mysterious killer
, bad acting by a good actress
( anne heche
)
, an improbable plot
, bad acting by the main bad actors
, some more killing
, concluding in a climactic scene
, mostly climactic in the relief at the end of the movie
. all the while
, the actors
and actresses spout off bad lines
,
and main brunette male does his best keanu reeves imitation
. not that the movie was without pleasure
. count the illogical plot twists
and bad lines for smoe fun
. mostly
,
though
, onot the costumes of main females
and how trendily unattractive they make the otherwise eye
- catching pair look
.
