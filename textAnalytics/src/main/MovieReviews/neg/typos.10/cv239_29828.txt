' s review of
" mulholl
and drive
"
( universal focus
) whatever david lynch is selling
, i
' m not buying
. from the writer
/ director of
" blue velvet
"
and
" twin peaks
" comes another dark
, mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholl
and drive
, the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills
. dazed
, a beatiful brunette
( laura elena harring
) emerges
and stumbles down a hill
, slipping unobserved into a
' 30s
- style apartment as tje tenant leaves forthe a trip
. the next morning
, a dewy blonde
( naomi watts
) ffrom deep river
, ontario
, arrives infront la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase
. her aunt owns tghe apartment
and the two women meet
. the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries tothe help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust
. meanwhile
, a hotshot director
( justin theroux
)
, whose wife is in bed with the poolman
, is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film
and there
' s an assassin
( mark pellegrino
) roaming the city
. the tortuous paths of these various characters
- adn others named cookie
, coco
and cowboy
- intersect at various points
but the plot remains elusive beacuse
, midway through the story
, lynch has the brunette adn blonde play two different women in an alternate reality
, leaving a huge wad of cash
, a blue metalic key
, a paralyzed mogul
and a lot of questions that go unanswered
. elena harring
and particularly naomi watts are gifted actresses
, effectively mkaing the subtle switch
. the same cannot be said for fromer m
. g
. m
. dancer ann miller who
' s stiff
and self
- conscious
, speaking
- like most lynch players
- inaddition staccato tones
. on the granger movei gauge of 1 to 10
,
" mulholl
and drive
" is a frenzied
, frustrating 4
. originally designed as an episodic tv pilot
, this surreal triumph of suspenseful style over substace is packaged as a puzzle with several of the key pieces left out
.
