perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with
"
.
.
. this is the fake news
,
" norm macdonald
, at times
, coudl elicit some laughter by blurting out semi
- offensive phrases in his raspy voice
, coated with a condescending attitude
. his shtick was marked by crassness
. in this movie
, for example
, when his girlfriend says that she
' s kicking him out because he
' s been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 monthes
, he tries to calm the situation by saying
,
" maybe ytou
' ll feel better after we have soem dirty sex
.
" this kind of humor cxan only go so far
,
but certainly can
' t go the distance in a full
- length feature
.
" dirty work
"
, is nothing more thna a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physicaly
. emotionally
, they
' ve never outgrown their pubescent eyasr
, which isnt somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback
.
al
though hvaing noone apparent real world skills
, tje one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people
. if tje meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket
,
then dump a bunch ofthe unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block
and watch the car burst apart
. mitch
( norm macdonald
)
and sam
( artie lange
) need to come up with
$ 50
, 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam
' s dad
( jack warden
) cin have a heart operation
. their idae is to start a revenge
- for
- hire business where tehy
' ll do your dirty work
. in the funniest scene
(
and possibly the only funny scene
) of the movie
, they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot
. their presence is established
,
but when a less
- than
- honorable real estate developer hires them
and
then reneges on the payment
, the two go tothe work to exact their sordid br
and of revenge
. by default
, dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots
,
but it delivers jerky boys level material
. exept for the bit at the used car lot
(
and possably another episode that involves frat brothers
)
, the dirty work is uninspired
and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call
. already weak on material
, it further spirals itself towards the video sotre by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido
and needs
' broads
'
and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor whith a gambling addiction
.
but what
' s really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has noone versatility as an actor
. relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder
and saying
" note to self
"
(
" note tothe self
: leran to fight
,
" he says after getting beat up
;
" note to self
: there
' s always beer
,
" he says after hitting rock bottom
; etc
.
)
, we feel like we
' re just watching an elongated rehash of his not
- so
- glorious days onthe saturday night live
. much like the television show
, for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits
. the rest of the story isnt just dead space
.
