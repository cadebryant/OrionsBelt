once upon a time jean
- claude van damme was a decent action hero
. the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films
, boasting his spectacular martial
- arts ability
. some of these excursions weere fun
.
but now it seems like watching a van damme movie hasnt become a painful chore
, iwth no rewards
but the virtualy guaranteed helping of mind
- numbing action
. anbd when the action goes sour
, what is htere left to enjoy
? i
' ll explain
. knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong
. marcus ray
( van damme
)
, a babe
- magnet adn stylish dresser
, heads up yhe company with an annoying weasel of a partner
( rob schneider
)
. they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans
, seemingly by a mole in the business
. i
' m going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph
, so if you want a review devoid of spoilers
, skip onto the next one
. i
' m not quite sure who gives a crap
,
but i
' ll issue a warning anyhow
. tommy is really working with the cia
. his boss
( a very hammy anbd flat paul sorvino
) is the mole
,
and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny
but immensely powerful super weapons
. he even stoops so low to put them into children
' s toys
. if you
thought this plot outline sounded intriguing
, hten you probably will enjoy knock off
. if you think that this ridiculous set
- up couldn
' t even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing
, tihs might not be your cup of tea
. knock off sucks
. it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could onyl conjure up in horrific nightmares
. it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something
, simply because van damme is the star
. the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind
, teh performances are so wooden you could use them tothe row a canoe
,
and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe
. directer tsui hark
( who teamed with van damme in the superior
,
but still lame
- brained double team
) is at the helm
,
and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us withthe thge plot
. i supose i enjoied some of the camera work
,
but tyhe incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous
. yhe picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence
, speeds are altered consistently
,
and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired
. it all sounds very cool
. trust me
, it isn
' t
. as much as it scars me to say this
( har
, har
)
, van damme is terrible
. sure
, he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves
and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease
. he looks like he
' s doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan
,
and his performance is stiff
and tired
. i hite to say it
,
but perphas it
' s time for mr
. van damme to give up his day job
. it
' s really a test of endurance watching knock off
. i suppose there
' s some enjoyment derivated from schneider
' s character
, who is extremely annoying
,
but provides the film
' s better moments
.
and what is yhe beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie
? hopefully she grabbed her paycheck adn thne fled the premises like an olympic sprinter
. knock off doesn
' t even st
and strong as a mindless
but intertaining action film
, like a h
andfull of van damme
' s others
. no
, this movie isnt an embarassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking
.
and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of lite in that department
, that is certainly not saying much
. note to self
: avoid universal soldier 2
: the return upon release in august
? 99
