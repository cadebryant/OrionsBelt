michael crichton has had a long carreer ofthe writing novels
, many of which are science fiction
. the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel
. so in the logic of the film industry a good way tothe make a profitable film would be tothe make a big
- budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel
. congo failed
,
and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going tothe fare a whole lot better
. it a little better than just okay novel
and it makes a film that is not even that good
. the film is expensive
, over one hundred million dollars
; isnt long
, 133 minutes
; has a terrific cast
, includng dustin hoffman
, samuel l
. jackson
,
and sharon stone
;
but has little that is really original
and less that is exicting
. several years ago dr
. norman goodman
( played by dustin hoffman
) was asked to rwite up a set of procedures fo the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered
. the plan he wrote was only semi
- serious
,
but doed explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien
. now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes
( peter coyote
) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s
. suddenly norman
' s less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft
. included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, biologist beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
,
and astrophysicist ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
. together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship tothe underst
and its secrets
. one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold
- toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship
. waht is disappointing about this film isnt tyhat it does not have really effective performances
. director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects
. the probelm here is he is making a big
- budget science fiction film
. it has some effects
,
but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen
. the technique is to suggest rather than to show
and let the actors
and teh viewer
' s imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting
. that could be a reasonable approach inthe a low
- budget film
.
but tht requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manaze to muster
. it requires thte actors tothe give really compelling performances
and simply put
, they don
' t
. hoffman
' s acting seems muted
. jackson seems to laid back
. we do nto feel for these characters
and do not get inside their heads
. levinson paid big bucks for his actors
and does not really get price performance
. anbd why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody
' s guess
. a cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price
. look how much more powerful a film like alien was with onyl moderate actors
. most science fiction spectaculars these days have second
- tier actors
and first
- tier special effects
. levinson tries second
- tier effects
,
and first
- tier actors
,
but never makes that exchange pay off forthe the viewer
. perhaps sci
- fi spectaulars are jsut not an actor
' s medium
. the result gets a 4 on tghe 0 to 10 scale
and 0 onthe the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
