tothe put it bluntly
, ed wood would have been proud of this
. a totally ridiculous plot is encompassed with bad humer
, hokey drama
, zero logic
and a crap screenplay
. also
, a beautifully anti
- climactic ending
. not to say it didn
' t look intriguing when i saw the previews
. so much for truth in advertising
. rol
and emmerich
, who
' s later
" independence day
" would look like
" hte 400 blows
" compaired to this
, co
- writed
and directed this inane sci
- fi film which uses the cliche of there bieng some connection between eqypt
and aliens
. in a useless opening sequence
, men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyphics on it
. it wouldn
' t be till present day
(
' 94
) till they would actually figure it out
. they
' re decipherer
? a slightly
- neurotic scientist
( nice twist
)
, dr
. dan jackson
( james spader
, doign his best outside of erotic thrillers
and some indy fare
) who
' s life sucks so much that people walk out of his lectures after the third word
. why do they use him to decipher what no one else could
? so there is a hokey ending
! duh
! he figures it out in about a minute
. yea
.
and
then they get a suicidal colonel or something
,
" jack
" o
' neill
( kurt russel
, with his wyat earp locks in the beginning
then a flat
- top that would make howie long snap into a fetal posistion
)
. why a suicidal colonel
? for the ending
! ytou
' ll get the hang of this
. htey open the stargate
, a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anything bad
. after an overdone special effects thing
, they
' re
.
.
. inside a goddam pyramid
. so they whent tothe egypt
, right
? wrong
. they
' re on another planet tyhat was filmed in egypt
. they discover a cilvilization ruled by ra
, the sun god
( the
androginous jaye davidson
, with a voice modifier to make him sound like barry white wiht asthma
)
,
and ther are fights
, explosions
and a kiss bewteen two people
. yea
. allso melodrama
, stupidity
, hokey scenes
and a bizarre language
. an anti
- climactic ending ends withthe stupid lines
(
" say hello to king tut
, asswhole
!
"
- the quintessential line
, lemme tell ya
)
and soem convenient pesudo
- pseudo
- psuedo
- character development
. by the end
, you just wanna go home
and watch
, i don
' t know
, the
" outer limits
" or something
. yhe script
' s terrible
. the special effects are okay
,
but nothing great
. the story
' s so weak that it
' s almost opaque
. the whole experience just isn
' t worth it unless you
' re so bored that you
' d consider watching a
" full house
" marathon
.
.
. or this
. i
' d pick this
, obviously
, bu still
, it
' s just not funn at all
. adn i can
' t wait for it to premier on mst3k
.
