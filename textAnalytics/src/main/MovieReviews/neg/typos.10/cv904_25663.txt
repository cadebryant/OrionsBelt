it ' s a good thign most animated sci
- fi movies come from japan
, because
" titan a
. e
.
" is proof that hollywood doesn ' t have a clue how to do it
. i don ' t know what this film is suppoed tothe be about
. from what i can tell it ' s about a young man named kale who ' s one of yhe last survivers of earth inthe the early 31st century who unknowingly possesses the key to saving
and re
- generatting what is left of the human race
. that ' s a fine premise for an action
- packed sci
- fi animated movei
,
bu ther ' s noone payoff
. the story takes the main characters all over the galaxy infact their search for a legendary ship that the evil
" dredge
" aliens want to destroy for no apparent reason
. so infact the process we get a lot of spaceship fights
, fistfights
, blaster fights
and more double
- crosses than you can shake a stick at
. there ' s so much pointless sci
- fi banter it ' s too much to take
. the galaxy here is a total rip
- off of the
" star wars
" universe the creators don ' t bother filling in the basic details which makes the story confusing
, the characters unmotivated
and superficial
and the plot just plain boring
. despite the fantastic animation
and speical effects
, it ' s just not an interesting movie
.
