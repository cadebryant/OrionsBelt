and just when yuo
thought joblo was getting a little soft around the corners
, not rating anything lower than your st
andard
" this movie sucks
"
, along comes this cinematic atrocity
and he
' s forced to take out his secret weapon
and spray it with a stench so thick
, even the bravest movie
- goer would think twice about seeing this waste ofthe time
. yes
, despite being a third sequel to a successful original movie
, the latest highl
ander doesn
' t seem to have anything going forthe it
. oh stinky movie
, let me count thee ways
.
.
. plot
:
( from wqat i understood
) a really bad highl
ander dued comes to the present looking tothe whack out the nice highl
ander dudes in order to gain their power
and become the mightiest immortal
.
.
. or something along those lines
. critique
: a complete
and utter mess
. disjointed
, incoherent
, boring
, corny
, filled with bad dialogue
.
.
.
and that
' s just the first thirty minutes
! this film doesn
' t seem to know what to do with itself
. it
' s confusing to anyone who doesn
' t know the serieses
( i include myself in that group
)
and apparently idiotic to those who do know the series
( i include die
- hard highl
ander fan the arrow in that group
)
. the film doesn
' t explain anything about itself
.
.
. it jstu goes from one inexplicable situation to anohter
. one moment they
' re in the present time
, the next moment
, they
' re in italy in the 1600s
. why
? who knows
. what are they talking about
? no idea
. flashbacks mixed in with the present
, mixed in with a few spontaneously cheesy fight sequences every now annd again
,
and i even rember seeing one flashback scene which went even furuther inot its pwn flashback scene
!
! hullo
.
.
.
?
!
? confused
yet
? i was annd i basically stopped giving a crap about anyone in the film whn i realized that neither the writer or director was interested infact presenting me iwth any kind of semblance of a story
. r
andom swordplay
, mad max
- like dudes showing up in motorcycles in the 1800s
? or were they infact the present at that time
? who knows
.
.
.
and to be honest
.
.
. who seriously cares
! this series should have been shooted in the head anbd put out ofthe its own misery a long time ago
,
but sadly
, someone at the studio decided taht it still had a little life left in it
. please
, please
.
.
. for the love of god
and all tyhat is holy in the world of movie
- making
,
and mostly out of respect forthe those who loved the original film
, put this series to bed
and end it
! even christopher lambert knew enough to play second fiddle to adrian paul in this one
. tyhe director also tries to do the best he cin with the muddled material
,
but all he sould come up with is plenty of slo
- mo action
, smoe fast
- motion fight scenes
and lots of smoke everywhere
. adn is there anything spectacular about the sword
- play or fight scenes
? nope
.
and i think we all could have done without all those zooming lambert face close
- ups
.
.
. yipes
, the man is not aging gracefully
, is he
? oh boy
,
and i haven
' t even gotten around to the greatest piece of over
- acting that i
' ve seen in years
. tjhe man who plays kell in this movie
, bruce payne
, should get a ham trophy for literally chewing up every piece of scenery that he gets near
. overacting is not a hobby for this guy
.
.
. it
' s a living
! he
' s alsot very funny
, not purposely
though
. all in all
, the movie stinks
. nuff said
.
