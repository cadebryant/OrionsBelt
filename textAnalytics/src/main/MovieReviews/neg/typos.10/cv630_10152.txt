when you ' ve run out ofthe old tv shows to turn into movies
, i guess you try video games
. why did i go to see mortal kombat
: annihilation
? the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw
. this film was a bunch of fighting
, yelling
, special effects
,
and bad acting setted to an oppressive techno music soundtrack
. the plot is fairly simple
: a portal has opened between our world
and the
" outworld
"
, allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn
( brian thompson
) to wreak havoc
and attempt to destroy humanity
. the good guys
, led by sorcerer rayden
( james remar
)
and human mortal liu kang
( robin shou
)
, must take the fight to outworld
, where the fate of both worlds will be determined
. here ' s the catch
: they must reunite princess katana
( talia soto
)
, who ' s on the good side
, with her ressurected mother queen sindel
( musetta vander
)
, who ' s on the bad side
, for their love for each other will close the portal
and ensure humanity ' s safety for another generation
. how this is supposed to work
, i still have no idea
,
but i liked katana ' s line
,
" i knew love would keep us together
,
" since that captain
and tennille song ran through my head
and i got a good laugh
. there are some seriously stupid things in this movie
. take
, for example
, a transporation system which utilizes the
" inner winds
"
, generated by earth ' s magma flows
. yuo get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast
. how fast
? as katana says
,
" you will be moving so fast
, it iwll be as if yuo are not moving at all
.
" what
? later
, sonya blade
( sandra hess
) goes to find jax
( lynn
" red
" williams
, otherwise known as
" saber
" on tv ' s american gladiators
) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu
. how do we know tihs is where she went
? there ' s a sign on the facility ' s perimeter fence that reads
: medical reasearch facility
- oahu
, hawaii
. remember
, this isnt not a caption
,
but an actual sign
. i guess the location is on htere for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are
. there ' s a lot of major flipping action
, too
. the first encounter between good
and evil shows kahn
and rayden swiftly arching
though the air toward one another
. do they land
and immediately get into the fighting
? does one of them land first
and catch the other off guard
? do they collide inthe mid
- air
? no
, apparently they flip towrad each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away
. why did they need those metal balls to travel
? everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b
. i have to admit
, the fight scenes are preety good
,
although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects
and fly wires
, allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body
and the laws of physics
. the movie ' s thrills are derived ffrom these scenes
and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly
.
" ouch
" was the most common expletive heard whn i screened this one
. you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights
, nto plot
, owudl be the main draw
, since dialog isnt apparently in teh film jsut to git from one fight to yhe next
. it seems that ' s all there is in this movie
. maybe it is
. as i had mentioned
, the acting is bad
. there ' s not one solid performance in the film
,
although williams as jax was pretty funny
. after a fight between sonya
and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling
, jax sasy
,
" you look good in mud
. no
, really
, you do
.
" remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his charater seriously
,
and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang
. brian thompson
, who has played good guys
, bad guys
,
annd even an alien on tv ' s the x
- files
,
but always some muscle
- binded behemoth
, is your averege evil demi
- god
,
but it ' s more the script ' s fault than his own that he doesn ' t have anything orignal tothe say
. the one really impressive thing about thsi movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour
and a half
. another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching
and kicking
, blood only appears in one scene
. all in all
, mortal kombat
: annihilation is loud
, violent
, shallow
,
and marketed toward kids
. hey
, just like the video game
!
