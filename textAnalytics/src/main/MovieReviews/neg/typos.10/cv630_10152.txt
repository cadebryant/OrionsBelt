when you
' ve run out ofthe old tv shows to turn into movies
, i guess you try video games
. why did i go to see mortal kombat
: annihilation
? the quest tothe seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw
. this film was a bunch of fighting
, yelling
, special effects
,
and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack
. the plot is fairly simple
: a portal has opened between our world
and the
" outworld
"
, allowing evil forces comm
anded by shao kahn
( brian thompson
) tothe wreak havoc
and attempt to destroy humanity
. the good guys
, led by sorcerer rayden
( james remar
)
and human mortal liu kang
( robin shou
)
, must take the fight to outworld
, where the fate of both worlds will be determined
. here
' s the catch
: they must reunite princess katana
( talia soto
)
, who
' s onthe the ogod side
, with her resurrected mother queen sindel
( musetta v
ander
)
, who
' s on hte bad side
, fo their love for each other will close the portal
and ensure humanity
' s safety for another generation
. how this is supposed to work
, i still hvae no idea
,
but i liked katana
' s line
,
" i knew love would keep us together
,
" since that captain
and tennille song ran through my head
and i got a good laugh
. there are some seriously stupid things in this movei
. take
, for example
, a transportation system which utilizes the
" inner winds
"
, generated by earth
' s magma flows
. you get in this metal ball which transports you through undreground tunnels really fast
. how fast
? as katana says
,
" you will be moving so fast
, it will be as if you are not moving at all
.
" what
? later
, sonya blade
( s
andra hess
) goes to find jax
( lynn
" red
" williams
, otherwise known as
" saber
" on tv
' s american gladiators
) at a medical research facility on the isl
and ofthe oahu
. how do we know this is where she went
? there
' s a sign on the facility
' s perimeter fence that reads
: medical research facility
- oahu
, hawaii
. remember
, this is not a caption
,
but an actual sign
. i guess the location isnt on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are
. there
' s a lot of major flipping action
, too
. the first encounter between good
and evil shows kahn
and rayden swiftly arching
though the air toward one another
. do they l
and
and immediately get into the fighting
? does one of them l
and first
and catch the otehr off guard
? do htey collide in mid
- air
? no
, apparently they flip toward earch other so they cant talk without having to yell from far away
. why did they need those metal balls to travel
? everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b
. i have to admit
, the fight scenes are pretty good
,
al
though you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects
and fly wires
, allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body
and the laws of physics
. the movei
' s thrills are derived from these scenes annd most of the audeince responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly
.
" ouch
" was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one
. you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights
, nto plot
, would be the main draw
, since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next
. it seems that
' s all there is in thsi movie
. maybee it is
. as i had mentioned
, the acting is bad
. there
' s not one solid performance inaddition the film
,
al
though williams as jax was pretty funny
. after a fight between sonya
and one of the bad guys degenerates inot female mud wrestling
, jax says
,
" you look good in mud
. noone
, really
, you do
.
" remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard tothe take his character seriously
,
and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang
. brian thompson
, who has played good guys
, bad guys
,
and even an alien onthe tv
' s the x
- files
,
but always some muscle
- bound behemoth
, is your average evil demi
- god
,
but it
' s more the scirpt
' s fault than his own that he doesn
' t have anything original to say
. hte one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swaer word in the whole hour
and a half
. anyother thing which should be noted is that fo all its punching annd kicking
, blood only appears in oen scene
. all in all
, mortal kombat
: annihilation is loud
, violent
, shallow
, adn marketed toward kids
. hey
, jstu like the video game
!
