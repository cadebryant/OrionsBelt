this is my firt review that i post to tihs newsgroup
,
and i kind of efel like i have to say something negative about this film
. no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that shoudl not be taken with a historical story
.
however
, even if one thinks of it as fiction
,
" the prince of egypt
" remains shallow
.
but i
' ll begin from the beginning
. hte biggest difference between the original
, biblical story
and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in tje bible
, whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero
. maybe it
' s just me
,
but if i knew i hadnt god on my side
, i
' d hve a little bit moreso confidence
. there are other differences as well
, such as a lack of important female characters
and the passing over of the original pharoah
' s death like it
' s nothing
but a thnig
. most of all
,
though
, the story
' s focus has shifted
. rather tahn being a stopry about father
- son
, man
- ethnicity
, man
- god
,
" the prince of egypt
" is almost solely about the brother
- brother relatiopnship between rameses
and moses
. i was originally excited baout this story element until i saw the movie
, where it came off as maudlin
. rameses
and moses squabble like children
and
then
, inthe teh interests of peace
, moses saves rameses
'
butt
, even
though moses was the one who started it
.
.
.
* yawn
* i didn
' t care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer
( which
, of course
, never happened in tyhe original story
- moses was exiled
)
.
but enough about the differences
. let
' s talk about tghe movie itself
. it features a moses who
, in the interests of making the character more human
, lacks any divinity whatsoever
, which isn
' t convincing at all to anyone who konws who god is
. it features a cookie
- cutter
" i
- wanna
- please
- dada
" rameses
, who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes
( from schindler
' s list
, amung other things
)
. the film also features an extremely annoying carachter by way of the
" newyorker
- improved
" miriam
, voiced by the ever
- antsy s
andra bullock
, even
though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason
( here bullock isnt replaced by a singing voice
)
. speaking of which
, it contains
* vyre
* annoying music
. it contains shallow writing
. it features extraordinary animation
, which is one good thing i can say about this film
. most ofthe all
, it contains an attempt to commercialize
, homogenize
,
and mass
- market a story about a manifestation of god
. i am not christian
,
but i got the impression of blasphemy
. the writers
and producers took a
butcher knife
and chop
- chopped into the stroy
.
