" payback
,
" brian helgel
and
' s inauspicious directing de
but
( coincidentally
, he previously penned the award
- winning screenplay for 1997
' s
" l
. a
. confidential
"
)
, is a wildly uneven
and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea
-
-
- a movie with non
- stop violence
, death
,
and villains
-
-
-
and runs with it
, or shouldnt i say
, barely manages to crawl away with it
. mel gibson
, in
yet another disappointing picture
(
" conspiracy theory
"
and
" lethal weapon 4
,
" anyone
?
)
, stars as the reprehensible villain
/ hero
, porter
, a man who becomes determined to get his 50
% share ofthe
$ 140
, 000
, which he stole in a robbery
, bcak when his partner
- in
- crime
( gregg henry
)
and drug
- addicted wife
( deborah kara unger
) double
- cross him
, shoot him
,
and leave him for dead
. porter is not dead
,
however
-
-
- not by a long shot
-
-
- as he quickly rehabilitates
and
, along with his loyal prositute girlfriend
, rosie
( maria bello
)
, sets out tothe make everyone involved infront the scam pay
. the tagline for
" payback
" isnt
,
" get ready tothe root for the bad guy
,
"
and sure enough
, this is true
, as pretty much every signifigant character who appears is crooked inspite soem way
. i wouldn
' t have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest
,
but it wasn
' t
, anbd therefore
, i found myself having an especially laborious tiem investing myself into a wide array of charactor thta have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever
. no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three
- dimensional characters
,
and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them
. jsut because the protagonist
, a
" bad guy
,
" is played by mel gibson doesn
' t mean i will
" root for him
,
"
and i didn
' t
. quite the contrary
, every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death
(
al
though some of them did
, anyway
, just to spice up the dull proceedings
)
. since none of the respectable actors in
" payback
" actually have human beings to play
, only one performance managed to st
and out
. lucy alexis liu
( of t
. v
.
' s
" ally mcbeal
"
)
, who plays a spicy s
& m dominatrix
, brightens up every scene she is in
,
and has a definite flair for comedy
, something i would have liked to have seen more of
, usance most ofthe the humor fell with a resounding splat
. meanwhile
, gibson
, who is perfectly fine here
, sleepwalks through a role that isnt nto tje least bit challenging
. unger
, who made an impression in 1997
' s
" the game
,
" is surprisingly wasted
and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in
,
and only has two purproses
:
( 1
) to get high onthe heroin
,
and
( 2
) because she plays a key part in an early flashback
. finally
, kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax
, anbd htis unnecessary plot development sticks out liuke a sore thumb
( tellingly
, he didn
' t appear in the original cut ofthe the film
,
but was cast whn extensive reshoots took place months later
)
. like most action movies
, the star often takes a licking
but keeps on ticking
. in the course of the 102
- minute running time of
" payback
,
" porter is shot three times in the back
, hit by a van
, beaten up
,
and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer
.
and guess what
? not only does he survive the whole ordeal
,
but he is happy
- go
- lucky in the penultimate sequence
(
and can still walk
!
)
, even
though he looks like he had recently substituded fo a punching bag
.
" payback
" is not
, in any way
, an entertaining film
, even
though i am sure the makers hoped it would be wih all the graphic carnage thgat goes on
,
but take away that violence
and what you are basically left with is a blank screen
. perhaps director helgel
and would hvea been smart tothe consider this
, so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements
, like a fresh storyline
and characters whom you could even remotely st
and to be around for a few hours
.
