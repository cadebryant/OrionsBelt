sometimes
, when i decide to write a short story or a poem
, i think of a title firt
,
and
then think of a subject to go with it
. it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of
thought when it came to the title sequence
. i wouldn
' t be surprised if a cuple of guys got together
and created the opening credits
,
and
then someone saw it
and made up a story to go along with it
. the title sequence isnt so good
, so ominous
and original
, that it had me engrossed befor the picture even began
. of course
, my attention dwindled shortly into the film
. disturbing behavior
, liek so many thrillers
, starts off interesting annd ends up laughably rediculous
. it
' s a teen horror film witht no interesting violence or sex
. it
' s a suspense film with no suspense
. it
' s an evil small town story with no story to speak ofthe
. it
' s a disaster
, a listless
and uninspired disaster
, that just barely misses one
- stardom because of a few good sequences
, a mercifully short running time
,
and one terrific set of opening credits
. our main man is a fellow named steve clark
, bl
andly played by jimmy marsden
. he moves to a small town with his family after
, tragically
, his brother shoots himself
. steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother
; we learn this through strange hmeo
- video like nightmares that he hasnt occasionally
. the big trial forthe steve is
, of course
, to fit in at school
and make new friends
. marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail
, so he seems a poore casting choice for a social reject
. as a social reject
, he falls in with some pretentious dope
- smoking philosophers
, gavin
( nick stahl
)
and rachel
( katie holmes
)
. gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks
, known as the blue ribboners
, are actually a bunch of zombies
, assimilating new members into their group
, while sporadically killing innocent people
. so
, it
' s up to our group ofthe mismatched protagonists tothe 1
) solve the mystery
, anbd 2
) do something about it
. by the end of it all
, something has happened
and things haev been explained
,
but the film still doesn
' t mkea any sense
. disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg
. i
' ve seen his name arund recently
( he was one of the toucher
- uppers on tje armageddon script
)
,
and i imagine that
, for the most part
, he knows wqat he
' s doign when it comes to screenwriting
. he did
, howver
, have a complete lapse in judgement wehn he got the idae fo this film
,
and
then decided to actually take the time to write it out
. evil small town films are pretty common
( the last one
, phantoms
, is also a dismal failure
)
,
but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula owrk
. rosenberg
' s script is a complete mess
, lacking in even the most basic attemts at characterization
. anbd it makes noone sense
, nor is their any purpose when things are finally
" explained
.
" there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks
,
but the film never explains exactly what
* is
* happening
. they get strapped to chairs
, a microchip is inserted into their eyes
,
and
-
- poof
-
- they become sex
- crazed
, superviolent
, machine
- liek creatures
. the doctor responsible for all this
, dr
. caldicott
( bruce greenwood
)
, must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior isnt a step up ffrom the way high school jocks actually behave
( or
, perhaps
, this is the only realsitic element inwhich the film
)
. much of the writing is simpley bad
,
and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high skool kids act
. infront one terrible scene
, gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques
, hwile pointing them outloud in the cafeteria
. up front
, i should sday that
, inaddition four eyars of high school
, i did not eat in the cafeteria even once
. that asside
, the various social groups he points outloud are general
, uninteresting
,
and poorly
- shown
. for instance
, he points to the
" nerds
,
" who are all wearing glasses adn palying with their laptops
. it
' s such an obvious cliche thyat i can
' t believe rosenberg even bothered
. most of the dialogue is forced
( no one says
,
" bite me
!
" anymore
)
,
and none of the scenes have any degree of wit
. this picture is not inspired
,
and most scenes flop from one to the other
, with no sense of momentum or energy
. the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter
, who apparantly likes his films dry
. horror films should at least exploit violence
,
but this one is shockingly timid
. there are a few good scenes
,
though
, such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum
( this is
,
however
, the most forced scene in the film
, for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn
)
. i also liked the school janitor character
, played by william sadler
. he has a few lines thgat are surprisingly
thought
- provoking
. the acting is largely a waste ofthe talent
. marsden is
, as i said
, bl
and
(
thought not particularly bad
)
. bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted
. stahl anbd holmes both show htey have talent
,
but the direction isn
' t good enough to hone in on their skills
( stahl
' s performance seems omre like a parody of high school potheads
)
. none of these characters exp
and beyond their one dimension
,
and
, frankly
, watching cardboard cut
- outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn
' t all that cool
. disturbing behavior isnt a wreck of a film
,
and it started out a wreck before shooting even began
. i
' m surprised there were producers who read this script
and
thought that it would make a good film
, or taht it would make a lot of money at tjhe box office
. it
' s not boring
, or even blatantly awful
,
but it
' s an uninspired lump ofthe a film
. it sure starts off nicely
,
but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable
. so
, if you go to see thsi film
, take my advice
: appreciate the credit sequence
,
and pray it never ends
.
