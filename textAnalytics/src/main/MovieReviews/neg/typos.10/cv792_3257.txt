htere
' s a good
,
and timely
, story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first
, a new movie about the abuses ofthe our prison sytem
. with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue
and the rights ofthe the accussed
and the incarcerated in jeapardy
, this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies
-
- a point of view
.
but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious
, often nauseating
, camera movements
and slick
, mtv
- style lighting
and editing are far more important
. there
' s not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling
.
and everything suffers
. christian slater annd kevin bacon star as defense attorney
and alcatraz inmate
, respectively
. after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape
, bacon murders anyother prisoner
and faces trial
. his young lawyer
( slater
) is fresh out of law school
but determined to
" put alcatraz on trial
" for the abuses of it warden
( gary oldman
)
. the result is the usual courtroom theatrics
- imagine a stanley kramer prodcution shot by hyperactive film school students
. there
' s very little to praise here outside of kevin bacon
' s earnest overacting anbd the appropriate story
. there
' s a lot of overacting from everyone
-
- you know you
' re in trouble right away when r
. lee ermey
( the drill sergeant in full metal jacket
) is cast as a judge
, hte center of reason
and moderation
. slater has never been convincing
and certainly isn
' t here
and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances
.
but thge worst feeling ytou git hwile watching murder in the first is tath the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story
. there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters
, let alone with them
. how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions
. if there
' s anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world
, it is our ability to tell a good story
. have we forgotten
