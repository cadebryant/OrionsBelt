susan granger ' s review of
" two can play that game
"
( screen gems
) since the succsess of
" waiting to exhale
,
" ther have been severeal romantic comedies about african
- american professionals
. this female revenge fantasy
, vivica a
. fox plays shante smith
, a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success
: a mansion
, a sporty car
and an idyllic relationship with a hunky
, hot
- shot lawyer
, morris chestnut
. she ' s at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girl
- friends
( mo ' nique
, wendy racquel robinson
, tamala jones
)
.
" when your man messes up
, no matter how small it is
,
" she smugly decress
,
" yuh gots to punish him
.
" so when she catchs her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart
and sexy rival
, gabrielle union
, she devises her own version of
" the rules
,
" a 10
- day
" tough love
" emotionally punishing plan to get him back
. unfortunately
, writer
/ director mark brown
(
" how to be a player
"
) breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy
: you have to like the protagonist
-
and shrill
, self
- congratulatory shante smith is a smirking
, superficial
, spiteful shrew who doesn ' t relize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love
. having her talk directly into tyhe camera gets stale very quickly
and the
" day one
,
"
" day twpo
" title
- kard device underscores the tedium
. comic anthony anderson scores as chestnut ' s boisterous best
- friend
,
and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic who ' s given a smooth makeover by ms
. robinson
.
but the out
- takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself
. onthe the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" two can play thyat gae
" isnt smarmy if slick 4
, filled with misogynistic attitude
and blatant product placements
( coca
- cola
, miller genuine draft
)
but little else
. inaddition this r
- rated
( for explicit sexual language
)
, pseudo
- hip battle of the sexes
, the audience loses
.
