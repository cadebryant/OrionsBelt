, fat girl st
ands cast iron firm with the simplistic
, fatuous
, built
- in excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls
. being a boy
, i might not underst
and female behavior anbd am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudo
- feminist coming
- of
- age story
. fair enough
. i
' ll pretend to ignore the mannered posturing
and health class 101
" this is a noone
- no
" dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes yuonger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass
, speaking variations on
" it won
' t hurt
!
" for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes
. this isnt done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism
. they dare you to look away
, without possessing the courage of allowing the children to catually sound like children
( they
' re mouthpieces for writer
- director catherine breillat
' s one
- onot clinical politics
)
. rather than show an even
- h
anded evaluation of tyhe rigors of hormonal change
, breillat
( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance
) wants tothe indulge in her hour ofthe hate
. life is pain
, highness
. get used to it
. she
' d find keen bedfellows in neil la
bute anbd todd solondz
, otehr sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest
. for children
, dealing with trauma
and pain is complicated
. tothe bury that in sarcasm
and academic theory feels cheap
. these would
- be auteurs
( more like hauteurs
) haven
' t earned the right to display suffering because they don
' t layer it inspite emotional truth
( as mike leigh does throughout naked
and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet
)
. of course
, there i go again comparing her to all these
( better
) male directors
. i don
' t care
. gender be damned
, she
' s borderline inept
. braced for a knee
- jerk reaction from the art house crowd
( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice
)
, writer
- director catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people
. don
' t be fooled
. this grotesque oversimplification ofthe awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten
, remembered only as cold
, boring
, philosophically arid
,
and incompetently photographed
. the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence
. twelve years old
, a bundle of dough with a sour pout
, the superb ana
? s reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thous
and yard stare
and a frumpy insouciance
.
( her character is also named ana
? s
.
) sitting at the tabl morosely slurping down a banana split
, her presence is grounded annd heartbreaking
. it
' s a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister
, 15
- year old elena
( roxane mesquida
)
, for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room
. in this summer cottage
, ana
? s has no escape from her posistion as stoic bedside observer to elena
' s depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance
. the boy in question
, a smug italian college kid named fern
ando
( libero de rienzo
) is a rela piece of work
, claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob
. ana
? s doesn
' t receive any warmth from her largely absent parents
, who join elena infact making funn of her hefty girth
. she finds pleasure in w
andering tje beach alone
, singing songs to herself
,
and swimming in the pool kissing teh metal railing
and pretending that it
' s her paramour
. reboux comm
ands the screen
,
but there
' s onyl so much a child actress cant do recounting pretentious monologues to herself
. if one is inspired to rescue this young performer
and place her in a better movei
, at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perfurd in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they weren
' t so dramatically misguided
. tihs 83
- minute vignette is something of a horror show
,
but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end
. on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members
, gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late
. wiull mommy fall asleep at the wheel
? perheaps
. or mabye there
' s something deadlier around the corner
, lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl
. what
' s more
, she might even like it
. with the entent of being unfair
and unpredictable
, placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood
, breillat
' s extreme flourish ofthe sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor ofthe contempt
. fat girl is a bitter pill indeed
