- up attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends
, twpo wives
and sevral innocent byst
anders
. tihs was a real audience pleaser at toronto
,
but it did not do much for me
.
, low 0
(
- 4 to
+ 4
)
- directed by peter berg who acted in the last seduction
and copl
and
.
- five buddies go onthe a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding tothe one of them
. one of the buddies accidentally kills a prostitute
.
- several people wiht no moral compass
. they started out with a simple
, innocent little cocaine party
(
!
)
and by accident look whta happened
. they have one moral person among them
( daniel stern
)
,
and one totally amoral person
( christian slater
)
. it is moreso selfish to let the amoral lead
, so they do
.
- this film is stange
, bu not really funny or biting
. black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange
. there should be some element of satire
. the satire is missing here
. i did not find myself laughing here either
. what we have is a strange crime tale
.
- one just does not care what happens to theese peopel
.
- the same idea of people jsut getting themselves in deeper
and deeper has been done frequentily
. if this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation
.
- it begins like diner
( particularly with daniel stern
)
and ends up like an extended horror
/ crime comic book
.
- there are several logical holes in script
. if a security man goes to investigate a complaint
and disappears
, wouldn
' t the guests he was investigating be the first suspects
? somene framed for a crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work
.
( i am desperately trying to avoid mkaing this a spoiler
.
)
- popular
and situation ethics get a real slamming
.
- some acting of grief is hammy
and overdone
. more yelling than humor
.
