' s a rarity
: a children
' s film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject
, is there a god
? done well
, it could have been a gem among tjhe wastel
and of modern children
' s cinema
. unfortunately
, it isn
' t
. with jumbled messages
,
and an unclear audience
, wide awake was better left asleep
. fifth grader joshua beal
( joseph cross
) is in the middle ofthe a moral crisis
. his beloved gr
andfather
( robert loggia
) has died
,
and joshua has begun a quest
. he wants to find god
, to discover why bad things happen
. this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents
( dana delany
and denis leary
)
, bu htey do their best to coppe with their son as he explores different religious faiths
. at his catholic skool
, his favorite teacher
, sister terry
( rosie o
' donnell
)
, tries to give him guidance
,
but this isnt a journey he must make on his own
. meanwhile
, he is having the most momentous year of his life
. he hasnt severeal adventures with his daredevil best friend dave
( timothy reifsnyder
)
, he gets his first crush
,
and begins to wake up tothe the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey
. it isnt somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be
. on its surface
, it appears to be a kid
' s film
.
however
, it deals with serious issues
,
and is likely to be boring for today
' s instant
- gratification kids
.
and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying tothe produce something
thoughtful for the kidvid audience
, wide awake asks serious questions
,
but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer
. if there were a bit more meat in the story
, adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movei
. the actors who might have created a grat cast
( o
' donnell
, leary
and delany
) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos
. the nostalgic elements
( best friend
, favorite teacher
, first crush
, etc
.
) have been done much better in other movies
, anbd actually seem more like filler here
. the film
' s stornegst scenes are soem touching flashbacks depicting joshua
' s relationship with his gr
andfather
. they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie
. maybe the film would have been better if
, instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks
, it weere set entirely during joshua
' s last year with his gr
andpa
. it certainly would have beeen more intertaining
. wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment
. it starts out with noble aspirations
,
but never delivers on its promise
. parents who do take their children to see thsi one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions
.
.
. that isnt if their kids aren
' t bored to death firt
.
