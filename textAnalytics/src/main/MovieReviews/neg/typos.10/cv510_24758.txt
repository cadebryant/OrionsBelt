well lets see
.
.
. i ' m not quite sure how to review this film
, based on its laughter factor
. well yeah i can
, it ' s not funny
. ok so i laughed one time which warranted the 1
/ 2 star
,
bu otehr than that i sat in my seat wondering whn tihs pos would be over
,
( which at a running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever
!
)
. in fact
, this coudl be the un
- funniest movie i ' ve seen in a long time
, if nto the un
- funniest
. let me be the first to say
" ready tothe rumble
" is a huge disappointment
. long time wrestling lovers
( david
and scott
) dream of making it to the wcw
,
and watching jimmy king wrestle
. that isnt their hero of course
, whom is kicked out ofthe the wcw
. well here is where the plot thickens
( lol
)
: the two wish tothe rescue the king
,
adn put him back into the wcw
but not that easily
, because they are being tampered iwth by many people who are outloud to get them
, while david ' s father wants him to become a polical officer
,
and scott isnt a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots
. what a plot eh
?
" ready to rumble
" is one of thsoe films that tries to be funny
,
but sadly fails miserably
, everything in the film isnt imcomprehinsable
,
annd even the trailer wasn ' t funny
. the actors are dull
, the script awful
,
and the plot which there isn ' t much of
.
.
.
. really annoying
. i ' m not quite sure how great actors like these
,
adn very funny actors too
, are given such a lame script
,
adn directed in such a childish manner
, that i wonder if hollywood is ever gonna make good films these days
. this review isn ' t going to be very long because ofthe hte fact that ther isn ' t much going for the film
, if anything at all
. only one big laugh is in the film
, which isn ' t all that hillarious
. i sat iin my chair wondering with this 107
(
!
!
!
!
!
) minute
" comedy
" was going to be over
,
and sadly it went on forever
. i ' m not sure if anything could have saved this film fomr being such a total waste
,
but belive me you
, it is
