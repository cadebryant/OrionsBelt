from a major league baseball radio broadcast
, featuring play
- by
- play man harry canary
and color man whitey hashbrown
, iwth special guest commentator james berardinelli
. hc
: as we go tothe the top of the 8th
, we
' re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli
, who
' s here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie
, major league
: bcak to the minors
, the third in tghe popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors
. nice to see ytou
, jim
. as a big baseball fan
and a movie resivwar
, can yuo give us the scoop onthe the new flick
? jb
: my opinion
: the producers should have stopped while they weere ahead
,
and that was nine years ago
. noe entry was definetly enough
,
and i
' m suprized there was a third after the anemic showing
and low quality of major league 2
. thsi latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct
- to
- video
. it
' s worse than a mediocre made
- for
- tv feature
. i should also mention that this movie likely won
' t play all that well in clevel
and
. now that the real indians are perennial contenders
, they have beeen replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks
. actally
, most of tje action involves the twins
' aaa minor league club
, the buzz
, rather than the actuall major league franchise
. hc
: sorry tothe interrupt
, jim
,
but we still have to do play
- by
- play for hte game on the feeld
. leading off this inning is john warren
. he steps into the batter
' s box
and takes kent
' s pitch low for ball one
. wh
: so
, the story
' s strictly minor league
, right
? what
' s it about
? jb
: scott bakula
, the guy ffrom quantum leap
, plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell
. when twins owner roger dorn
, once again portayed by corbin bernsen
, needs a new manager for his aaa team
, he offers the job to gus
, who is nowe faced with two daunting tasks
: turn the team around
and groom hot prospect downtown
anderson
( played by walt goggins
) for a promotion to
" the show
.
" witht thte help ofthe former major leaguers pedro cerrano
( dennis haysbert
)
, rube baker
( eric bruskotter
)
,
and isuro tanaka
( takaaki ishibashi
)
, gus gets the buzz on the right track
. inspite fact
, he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big
- league club
, leonard huff
( played whith over
- the
- top relish by ted mcginley
)
. soon
, dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus
' overachieving gropu against huff
' s overpaid
, last
- place bunch
. wh
: cxan we guess who wins
? jb
: the results haev all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you
' ve already seen the box score
. on top of that
, none of the mock
- ups are presented with much flair
. they
' re nto just boring
; they
' re lacklustre
.
but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension
; they
' ve been baout using baseball situations to generate laughs
. hc
: warren fouls off a fastball
. 1
and 1
. wh
: are there lots of yuks in this one
? jb
: not one
, from start to finish
. i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh
and funny
. okay
, a lot of the jokes were sophomoric
,
but they made me laugh
. the two sequels haven
' t just been stale
,
but their humor quotient has beeen abysmally low
. even bob uecker
' s once
- sharp one
- liners have turned lame
, anbd they
' re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing
. hc
: here
' s the 1
- 1 pitch
. looooooong drive
? fair or foul
? foul ball
! the count goes to 1
and 2
. wh
: does the film at least get the baseball details correct
? jb
: yes
. there aren
' t any glaring errors like there were inwhich one of the best
- ever baseball movies
, the natural
.
but i
' d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story
, believable characters
, or even a little genuine humer
. heck
, tghe naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league
: back to the minors
. wh
: it
' s nice to see old friends one more time
, isn
' t it
? liek cerrano
, tanaka
,
and dorn
. jb
: depends on whether you really care that anyone is back
. there aren
' t any real characters here
? just an assortment of cliched oddballs
. yeah
, the voodoo hitter
, the catcher who can
' t throw back to the pitcher
, the japanese player
,
and the conceited player
- turned
- owner ahev all returned
,
but who really cares
? they have no depth
. notable absences include tom berenger
' s veteran
and charlie sheen
' s
" wild thing
.
" we don
' t really miss them
,
though
. hc
: breaking ball
, low
and outside
. 2
and 2
. wh
: so you
' re saying that we should give this one a miss
? jb
: that
' s right
. to use baseball terminology
, it
' s a threee
- pitch strikeout
. if you
' re looking for a ogod movie that involves baseball
, try popping the natural
, field of dreams
, bull durham
, or even the first major league into the vcr
. actually
, this is an oddly
- timed release
, since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters
. even tje minor league seasons are already underway
. don
' t bother with major league
: back to the minors
. it
' s a wretched time
- waster
. wh
: thanks for thte advice
. jb
: you
' re welcome
. hc
: adn here
' s the 2
- 2 pitch
. fouled back
, right into this booth
. hey
, jim
, heads up
! oops
. somebody better get him some ice for that
. he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies
,
but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls
. odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him
, almost as if he has a grudge to settle
. anyway
, back to the action onthe the field
?
