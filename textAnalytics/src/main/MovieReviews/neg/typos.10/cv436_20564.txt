chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with oney notable exception
: instead of a speeding bus
, we now have an ice cream truck
. the truck isnt driven by arlo
( cuba gooding jr
.
)
and mason
( skeet ulrich
)
, who ahev been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder
. this particular weapon
( nicknamed
` elvis
'
) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees
, or else the shockwave iwll goo
- iffy everything in a mile radius
. that would be pretty nasty
. the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene
, as dr
. richard long
( david paymer
) conducts a test on an isolated tropical isl
and
. long accidentally melts 18 soldiers
and defoliates virtually the entire isl
and
, due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance
. the comm
anding officer
, general brynner
( peter firth
)
, is sentenced tothe 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops
. upon his release
, the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down
, snatching elvis
,
and selling the weapon to the higest international bidder
. protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper
( ulrich
)
and a feisty ice cream delivery man
( gooding jr
.
)
, who must elude brynner
' s men
and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder
. all the while
, of course
, they must keep tjhe weapon below 50 degrees
. this proves to be tricky
. among the wild adventures arlo
and mason partake in is a trip down a tree
- covered mountainside inspite a boat
,
and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle
. they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing
. to put it simply
, i
' ll use a clever pun
: chill factor should be put on ice
. director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed
, broken arrow
and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bl
and cocktail of a chase movie
. when there is some occasional acation
, the audience seems oddly detached from it
. perhaps that
' s because we
' ve already waded through a pool of clich
? s
and boring dialogue
; all material that
' s been used before
,
and with a lot more spice
. take the villains
, for example
. they are typical sterotypes of every terroist that has ever walked the silver screen
. they speak lines that hve been recycled profusely from one movie to the next
, divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint
,
and act in very predictable ways
. the tag
- team of gooding jr
.
and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is
. frankly
, i
' m not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man
. i supose it
' s better than him dressed like a giant hot dog
, selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner
. gooding displays one single emotion in this movie
, which isnt frequently on display in lines like
` i
' m gonna get on yo ass liuke lastest year
' s underware
!
'
and the incessant sputtering of
` oh
, sh
* t
!
' this is virtualy the same character he played in jerry maguire
and as good as it gets
.
but where gooding ws once an exciting actor
, he now seems dull
and endlessly monotonous
. at least he
' s a bit more captivating than ulrich
, who has all the film
' s worst dialogue
,
but does nothing noticeabe to enliven his charachter
. the supporting casted
, whitch includes every personality you expect to pop up
, is also wasted
. to be fair
, there are a few brief moments of serviceable action
.
and i did chuckle a few times
. oney example is when ulrich
( an employee at
` darlene
' s diner
'
) is at the counter when brynner walks through the door
.
` you own this place
?
' the general asks
.
` yeah
,
' ulrich syas
.
` they call me darlene
.
' these little tidbits of humor are
( mainly
) welcome in this weak
, disappointing wreckage of an action film
. as a speed clone
, it could have benefited from a lot more suspense
and perhaps
( god forbid
) even some decent writing
. sadly
, i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could haev been
.
