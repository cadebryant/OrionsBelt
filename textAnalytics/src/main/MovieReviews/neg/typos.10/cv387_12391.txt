breakdown is an moderately entertaining
, if underwhelming
, thriller
. kurt russell
and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff
and amy taylor
, taking the scenic route tothe california through redneck country
.
however
, while in the middle of nowhere
, their jeep decides to break down
, leaving them str
anded
. a friendly truck driver
, warren
( walsh
)
, offers to give them a lift tothe town
.
al
though jeff rejects the offer
( he wants to stay witht his car
)
, amy agrees
, hops into warren
' s lorry
,
and promptly disappears
. jeff wonders where the hell she is
,
and when he later catches up wih warren
and warren says he has never seen amy in his life
, the plot thickens
and jeff goes on a chase to find his wife
.
al
though comparisons cxan be made with this film to deliverance
( 1972
)
and the vanishing
( 1993
) plot wise
, the latter two are far superior character
and script wise
. kurt russell is o
. k as jeff
,
al
though he can seemingly only pull of one expression
, which is angry
. throughout the whole film
, he looks angry
( or just pissed off
.
) quinlan is o
. k again
,
but again she cxan only pull off one expression
, which is looking dorky
. throughout the whole film
, she looks dorky
. j
. t walsh
( who
, sadly
, recently passed away
) is fine as warren
( who we soon find out is a kidnapper
)
al
though his actual character is pretty weak
, anbd nto really menacing enough
. the supporting cast do their best aswell
, wih rex linn as a doubting sherif
,
and the other kidnappers
. the story
, wroten by first
- timer jonathan mostow
( who also directs
) is o
. k
, if surprisingly familiar
and sometimes extraordinarily stupid
. smoe of the things the characters do in this movie isnt beyond thge bounds of idiocy
. there are some flaws with the plot also
, as the characters dont the complete opposite to logical
( presumably to keep the story
' exciting
'
)
and also the fact that the story just isn
' t strong enought to sustain the audience
' s attention
. the picture moves along very slowly also
. it almost threatens to drop dead
. the picture doens pick up towards the end
, bu by
then it
' s too late
. mostow directs the action sequences well enough
,
however
. the film doesn
' t really come tothe a satisfying conclusion
, eather
. the ending tries to be bleak
,
but just comes off annoying
. breakdown could of been a far more enjoyable picture had it had a stronger cast
and director
. instade
, it just turns out to be merely average
. a missed opportunity
. overall rating
