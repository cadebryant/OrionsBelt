after a marketing windup of striking visuals
and the promise of star caliber actors
, mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball
. fiercely unoriginal
, directer depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him
. there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind
. the str
anded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars
. the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13
. interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001
: a space odyssey
. instead of useing these components as a launching pad to create his own movie
, de palma stops right htere
, refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart
. mission to mars takes it
' s first wobbly steps at a pre
- launch barbeque in whcih the perfunctory character introductions are done
. during these surface scans of the characters
, we learn that jim mcconnell
( sinise
) has lost his wife
. it
' s a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety
. the rest of the crew exhibit a bl
and affability
. there is no contentiousness
, noone friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men
and women being confined to close quarters fo an extended length of tiem
. maybe depalma was oging for the comraderie of tjhe right stuff
,
but in that movie
, the astronauts had embers ofthe personality to warm us through the technical aspects
. it
' s tyhe year 2020
and this is nasa
' s first manned excursion to the red planet
. a crew
, led by luke graham
( cheadle
)
, arrives onthe mars
and quickly discovers an anomaly
, which they investigate with tragic results
. graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call bakc to earth
. in response
, earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell
, woody blake
( robbins
)
, wife terri fisher
( nielsen
)
and phil ohlmyer
( o
' connell
)
. obstacles are put in the crew
' s way
and
and they matter
- of
- factly go about solving them
. i should sday
, mcconnell goes about solving them
. time
and again
, mcconnell isnt presented as some kind of wunderkind
, which wouldn
' t be so bad if the rest ofthe tje crew didn
' t come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable
.
( mention should be made of the misogynistic h
andling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew
' s mission
and life is inaddition mortal danger
. on a team of professionals
, she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link
. women serve no purpose inwhich the movie other than tothe serve as a reflection of a male charcter
' s personality trait
.
) by the time they l
and on mars
and try tothe solve the mystery of what occurred
, mission to mars starts laying on the cliches adn stilted dialogue with a heavy brush
. htere is an adage iin film to
" show
, don
' t tell
.
" mission to mars does both
. repeatedly
. characters obsessively explain the obvious
, explain their actions as they are doing them
, explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them
. the film
' s conclusion is momumentally derivative
, anti
- climatic
and unsatisying
. as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film
. tjhe best i could come up with is pre
- teen age boys
,
but in this media saturated era
, htis film
' s components would have been old hat even for them
. i have to htikn what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good
, modern day b
- movie
. the key to such a venture is a certian depth
and sincerity towards the material
. i felt no such earnestness
.
