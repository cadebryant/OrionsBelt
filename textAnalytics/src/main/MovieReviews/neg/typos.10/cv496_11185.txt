an attemt at florida film noir
, palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels
. it
' s slow moving
, uninvolving
,
and plain just uninteresting
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) is an ex
- newspaper man
, just out of jail after being framed for a crime
. his luck hasn
' t been the best
,
but things are looking up when a misteryous woman
, rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, approaches him with a proposition
. she wants harry to help her
and her stepdaughter
, odette
( chloe sevigny
)
, pull off a fake kidnapping scheme tothe get
$ 500
, 000 out ofthe her stingy
,
but rich
, husb
and felix
( rolf hoppe
)
. at first
, all harry isnt expected to do isnt provide a threatning voice on the phone
,
and to collect the money
( ofthe which he gets to keep 10
%
)
.
but
, as the deed is carried out
, things are not what tehy seem
,
and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm
. palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film
,
but the effect never quite comes together
. it
' s got the sultry florida heat
, seductive women
,
and even curvier plot twists
,
but the whole hting smells of paint
- by
- numbers
. sure
, the right ingredients are htere
,
but the end result isnt much too artificial
. a lot of the problems lie with the script
, which
,
though providing smoe genuine surprises
, is packed full of leaden dialogue
and bl
and situations
. even the plot twists don
' t seem to flow well with tje rest ofthe the story
. some of them
, for example
, come fomr so far afield that they seamingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist
( for example
: harry
' s spontaneous job offer
, or the whole typewriter situation
)
. the characters are mostly lifeless
, palyed to tipe
,
but not much more
. woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick
- headedness that it
' s hard to even picture him as an ex
- journalist
. elisabeth shue vamps it up
,
but doesn
' t add anything special to the role
. chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance
, trying to be a sexy 17
- year old
,
but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth
. some of the supporting cast
( notably gina gershon
and michael rapaport
) give stronger
,
but
, in the end
, meaningless performances
.
and to top it off
, tyhe pacing of the film is much too slow
. as the movei grinds to a halt
, you
' re given too much time to wonder why you
' re wasting it watching palmetto
. if you
' re in the mood for tihs type of movie
, you
' d be much better off going out
and renting some classic film noir
.
