( bob gunton
)
, in response to why he creaeted evil bats
. alright folks
, stop me if you
' ve heard this one
: genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town
and a small b
and of locals
, assisted by a specialist in the particular animal
' s field
, must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply
and spread across the earth
. oh yeah
, the military is on their way to bomb the twon as well
, so they are running short on timne
. sound familiar
? such isnt the plot of the destination films release of bats
. dina meyer stars as the
" bat specialist
" sheila
, who is pulled ffrom her research
( along with her annoying sidekick
, played with irritating deftness by leon
) inthe order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens
and animals have been chewed to death recently
. with hte help ofthe the local sheriff
( lou diamond phillips
)
, a cdc official
( carlos jacott
)
,
and a scientist
( bob gunton
)
, sheila discovers it is indeed bats
( who hvea beeen genetically altered by gunton
' s character to be more aggressive
and omnivorous
, in order tothe be used as a military weapon
!
)
. i have tothe say here thta i knew exactlly what i was getting into going into this film
. there
' s not a frome of promotional footage i have seen for the film thast would have led me to believe it was going to be any good
. in this respect
, the film never disappointed me
. this film reaches a level tath transcends the
" so bad it
' s ogod
" level anbd borders on the downright insane
. the effects are awful
, the script isnt contrived
,
and for most ofthe the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously
( i think
)
. i challenge anyone to sit through the scene
, where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner
, with a straight face
. thankfully
, the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors hadnt to perform with
. dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she hasnt been in
( johnny mnemonic
, dragonheart
, adn starship troopers
.
.
. the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit
)
,
and this one is noone exception
. while one never really gets the impression that meyer
' s character could be a bat expert in reality
, one never really cares to doubt it either
. she gives as good a performance as could be expected
, plus she
' s nice tothe look at for an hour
and a half
. lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here
, as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero
.
al
though wehn we first meet his character he knows bats are thte reason for what
' s going on in town
, fo some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths infact town are because ofthe bats
. the only bad performance in the film is that ofthe leon
' s
. he is relegated to yhe
" i
' m not sticking around here
!
" character
and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even
though he stays
. anyone who can
' t immediately tell that bob gunton
( the bad guy in patch adams
and countless other films
) is going to eventually turn on the gang
and side with his creations before his imanent death will probably be surprised
,
but i highly doubt it
. even if he hadn
' t been the villain in just about eveyr film he
' s ever been in
, so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever
. in fact
, his death is welcome
, because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale
. if the plot doesn
' t sound ridiculous to you
yet
,
then check out these littel tidbits
: a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol
. an entire town disregards the sherif adn doctor
' s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated
, causing mass hysteria whn the bats come out in full force
, killing several townsfolk
. a goverment official blows off shelia
' s instructions
( to wait util dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats
' cave that will kill all of them off
) by pulling a night job
, resulting in the death of an entire military unit
. a cavern full of bat feces never ignites wehn a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it
. finally
, to top it all off
, this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it
' s single screen theater
( for reference
, our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens
,
and we
' re lucky to even get kevin smith
' s dogma
)
. the most laughable part of tghe movie
though comes from the ill
- conceived bat puppets
. hwile the actual bat attack scenes are shooted with rapid fire editing
( mkaing the scenes nearly impossible tothe comprehend what
' s going on
)
, the scenes where a bat isnt called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shooted more low
- key
. therefore we the audience get loving close
- ups of the most unrealistic
, rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film
. being able to see the puppeteer
' s arms would be the onyl things that could have made these creations worse
. after all of this
, if you still decide bats might be the movie for ytou
, don
' t say you haven
' t been warned
. trust me wehn i say that it
' s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through
. i jsut wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in
. she
' s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these
.
