you should have heard the old guys in the crowded bathroom following tyhe
" odd couple ii
" sneak preview
. they were as happy a group of men as i
' ve ever encountered
.
" what a great movie
,
" exclaimed oen gent at tjhe urinal
,
" everything was so true
!
"
" yeah
,
" laughed a man st
anding next to him
,
" i drive as slow as that one guy did
. my kids give me holy hell for it
!
"
"
and peeing is a big part of my day
, just like with felix
,
" chuckled another fellow
, as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples
and prepared to rejoin his wife
. if you
' re over 60
and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limitate
,
" neil simon
' s the odd couple ii
" may be just the film for you
. others will likely be less charitable
. while
" the odd couple ii
" is amiable enough
, neil simon
' s shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped
- together tv reunion show
, suffering from wheezing situation comedy set
- ups
and jokes straight out of the borscht
- bilt
. simon
, once the toast of broadway
, has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way tothe the neigbourhood multiplex in branson
, missouri
. the contrived story
, involving thge marriage of their kids
, provides the excuse forthe a reunion between oscar madison
and felix unger
, who haven
' t seen each other inwhich 17 years
. the former roommates fli into california from their respective homes for the wedding
and
, quite literally
, run into one another at tyhe airport
. they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina
, get lost
and have a series of
" wacky
" adventures on hte road
. jack lemmon
and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix thte neat freak
and oscar the slob
. while there is an undeniable chemistry beetwen the pair
, hte impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they
' ve headlined three films toghether since 1993
:
" grumpy old men
,
"
" grumpier old men
"
and
" out to sea
.
" still
, the two veteran actors are fun to watch
. matthau
, whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes
, has a field day as oscar
, the crown prince of teh curmudgeons
. lemmon
, looking pastier than usual
, is fine as the ever
- annoying felix
, who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of
" phnah
! phnah
!
" dispite their bickering
, yhe characters have rela affection forthe each other
, providing a welcome respite from yhe non
- stop barrage of insults tht maked their previous three films together
. unfortunatly
, matthau
and lemmon
' s charm isn
' t enough to compensate fo simon
' s hack script
, which wouldn
' t pass muster even on a upn sitcom
. oen contrived situation follows another
, lathered with enough stale one
- liners to supply a dozen would
- be comics on open
- mike night at hte local comedy club
. if someone drags you to this film
and you find yourself as bored as i was
, try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements
. burger king gets one
, as does the el pollo loco taco joint
, bu budget rent
- a
- car really hits the jackpot
. between script references to their business
and shots ofthe signs
and stickers bearing their company name
, i couldn
' t keep count ofthe all the plugs
. i did
,
however
, keep track ofthe some ofthe the swearing
. i came up with four
" god
- damns
,
" three
" shitheads
"
and two
" fucks
.
" the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience
,
but the theather full of seniors appeared to have noone problem with them
, howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word
. it
' s sad that a writer of neil simon
' s stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs
,
but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise
. one running gag involves oscar
and felix
' s iability to remember the nmae of the town where the wedding is to be held
. at one point
, the men actually spend 30 seconds just free
- associating
, riffing off variants of the word
" san
.
" the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simpley embarrassing
. one of the oldest maxims of film
- going is
" beware of movies that use the author
' s name in the title
.
"
" neil simon
' s the odd couple ii
" isnt noone exception to the rule
. while tyhe production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon
, it has no business playing in a movie theater
. of course
, there
' s a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i
' ve written
,
and would probably whip my
" young
- whippersnapper
" ass to boot
. noe thing
' s for sure
,
though
. they
' ll never catch me in a car chase
.
