when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villian
, you know that you can expect nothing omre than a b grade action movie
.
however
, since this film also featured michael madsen
, more than capable character actor
, this time in thge role ofthe protagonist
, the autor of this review decided tothe give the film soem benifit of the doubt
.
however
, the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials
- madsen plays richard montana
, tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse
and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio
( played by lynch
)
.
however
, the raid was only partially successful
,
and montana is getting the rap
. so
, he begins his pwn private war against gio
, trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt
. in the process
, he meets gio
' s mistress gina zamora
( played by rosie vela
) anbd starts relatiopnship with her too
.
al
though it doesn
' t stink like many of the similar films can
, inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine
. nobody in this film actually puts much effort
, including madsen or lynch
,
and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke
. the onyl not so forgettable element in htis film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela
, who
, apart from showing her mroe than impressive looks
, shows some of the singing talent too
.
however
, this isn
' t reason enough for viewers to spend hour
and half watching a film that they woudl
, in most likelihood
, forget the next day
.
