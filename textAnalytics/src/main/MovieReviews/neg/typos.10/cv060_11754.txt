one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles
. he has builded a strong reputation with films like matewan
and the secret of roan inish
,
and one of his best was his last film
, lone star
. after sayles gave us this complex
and unconvential look at ethnic tensions onthe the us
- mexico border
, expectation ran high for his next film
. unfortunately
, his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for
. we are essentially told in tghe first reel where the film is goign to go
and what it is going to do
.
then the film does exactly what it promised
, a painful as that isnt
. the plot of men with guns can be summarized
" in a central or sourth american country things are really bad for everybody in tjhe mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas
. dr
. fuentes did not beleve how bad things were so he whent
.
and he found out again
and again
and again
.
" of course it isnt perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell
. a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians
.
but the film talks down to the viewer
. dr
. fuentes
( played by federico luppi
) teaches medicine in teh captial city of his country
. he has
, as a great humanitarian gesture
, trained
and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains
and make the world a little better for the poor indios
. fuentes believe the students to be up there doign humanitarian service
.
then he discovers noe of his best students has instead returned tothe the city
and runs a squalid private pharmacy
. in shame
and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others
. thte student tells him the others are still in the mountains
, bu suggests that it may not be a good place to be
. fuentes goes off to find
and visit yhe doctors
, ignoring the advice of his family
and a patient who happens to be an army genaral
. the results are little different than one would expect
. dr
. fuentes starts outloud incredibly naive
. even some american tourists
, present infront the film mostly for comic relief
, seem to know better than dr
. fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains
.
but fuentes has to go from one scene ofthe barbarity to another
and disover how wrong he was
. sayles certainly sould have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something omre profound than that nasty things are hapening down there
and most of the worst happens tothe the unarmed civilians
. the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences
. federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos
. damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter
. m
andy patinkin hasnt a small role made tothe look bigger in the trailer
.
