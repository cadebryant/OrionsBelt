the
" disney stick
- to
- what
- you
- do
- best
" rule states that disney
' s animated features will invariably be sublime bu whenever tehy try thier h
and at live
- acation kids
' entertainment
, tehy will fail miserably
. this goes double for occasions when they try to make a live
- action adaptation of a popular ctaroon
( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations
? i
' m still trying to forget
)
. that rule proves more dependable tahn ever wtih inspector gadget
, an insulting
, despicable
and
, worst of all
, expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children
' s film
. it will bore anyone over five
and should prove unbearable for adults
, even at its relatively skinny running timne of 80 minutes
. it
' s films like this that make me watn to go to my local blockbuster
and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets
and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects
. just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there isnt hope for him as an actor
yet
, his career takes a nosedive to hell wtih his
" role
" as john brown
, a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen
and help the peopel around him
. he dreams of heroic deeds
and the subsequent admiration ofthe his long time crush
, dr
. brenda bradford
( joely fisher
)
. bu aftter a faw bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer
. john breaks every bone infront his body while trying to save dr
. brenda
' s father
. dr
. brenda has beeen working on a
" gadget project
,
" which would amking a half
- man half
- machine super
- policeman to fight crime
. feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject
, realizing his dream of becoming a policeman
. now
, when he says
" go go gadget
[ insert name of gizmo here
]
" he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks
, bang up b
andits
and mangle murderers
. in the meantime
, the evil claw
( rupert everett
)
, teh man responsible for the murder of the good doctor
' s father is building a gadget of his own
: a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil anbd john brown
' s worst nemesis
. claw has plans of world domination
, which leaves it up to the inspector anbd his gadget mobile
( voice of d
. l
. hughley
) to save humanity from his wrath
. state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this
$ 90 million dollar movie
and
yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere
. had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the smae effect
. what we see onthe the screen is like hte raw ingredients of a meal
: all of the expensive f
/ x amounts to nothing
. part of the charm of the tv sories was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie
. can kids really admire a hero so goody
- two
- shoes that he screams
" hey
! you ran a stop sign
!
" while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle
? i think that today
' s children wiull respond better to somebody dashing
, someone ultra
- cool
. they
( propably
) receive enough preaching from their parents
and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want tothe go to an action movie to see a father figure kick
butt
. in addition to the more complex complaints above
, ther
' s also the simple stuff
: inspector gadget is boring
, formulaic
and achingly implausible
. there
' s no feeling that the directer really cares baout his story
: more than any other film i
' ve seen this year
, this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line
. there
' s a popular commercial
( forthe sprite
,
but that
' s irrelevant
) runing in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects
. it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious
( thank god
) movie called
" death slug
"
. each executive gleefully presents a different merch
andise tye
- in
( slug taco
! slug on a stick
!
)
. at the end one of them asks
" what about the movie
?
" another answers
:
" well
, we don
' t have a script
yet
,
but we can bang one outloud by friday
.
" they probably could have replaced
" death slug
" with inspector gadget
. this film contains the sort of logical contradictions
and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script
. it
' s no coincidence that most good children
' s entertainment these days comes from animation
. animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers
and they put care
and pride into their work
. these kinds ofthe films are banged outloud quicker
and a good percentage turn out worthless
, sloppy
and impersonal
. the studios are becoming factories
and films theri assembled products
