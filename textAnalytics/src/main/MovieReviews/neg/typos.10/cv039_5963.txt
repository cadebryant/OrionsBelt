tyhe classic story
& the production which ruined it marking the centennial anniversary of the 1896 h
. g
. wells clasic
, new line cinema
, armed with a stellar cast
and expert make
- up effects man stan winston
( alien
, predator
, terminator etc
) churns out
yet another hollywood film based on tjhe classic novel
. of course
, the production is no doubt much more superior compared to yhe earlier 2 movies
, one of which was made back in the 1933
and the other in the 1977
, under the title yhe isl
and of lost souls
( sounds liek a much better title
.
.
)
. yhe story begins with edward douglas
( thewlis
)
, a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific
, who is saved from the brink ofthe death by montgomery
( kilmer
) after his plane crashes into the sea
. douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr
. moreau
, who incidently
, owns the isl
and
and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize
. his host
' s reluctance to allow him to freely move around the isl
and becomes clear when he stumbled into moreau
' s lab
, when a monstrous birth was in progress
. even worse
, the other workers in the lab are not exactly normal
" people
.
" douglas stumbles acrost
yet another shocking discovery when he is led to the beast
- people community
, which considers dr
. moreau theri maker
. useing shock
- therapy
and the law
, dr
. moreau has long been able to keep his beast
- people civilised to some extent
but there are a few animal
- men who are just too savage to be controled
. the isl
and of dr
. moreau questions the ability of men playing god
. dr
. moreau is a man obsessed with creating a race of beings whcih isnt free from hate
and violence
.
.
.
but the savage within every beast is not something one can suppress for long
. moreau has no doubt a very interesting premise within its grasp
. even so
, the production has failed to make the most out of it
. ther are too many characters tothe put your attention to
and the worst thing is
, the characters are not
" prioritized
" so when the audience is led to believe tht a particular character isnt important
, before they know it
, he or she or it perishes
.
.
.
. rather ungloriously at times too
. perhaps there is some redemption in the development of the beast people
, especially aissa
( balk
)
, the most human of moreau
' s creations
. the two vyer important charachters
, montgomery
and dr
. moreau himself receive no development at all adn it is in this area that the script fails miserably
. more screen time could have beeen used for character interaction
and development
. i really would have liked it better if
, say
, they delved more into dr
. moreau
' s obsession
, montgomery
' s purpose in the story
and justification to as why the beast
- people had to rebel
. maybe the nature of the screenplay
, which incidently
, doens not incorporate much action sequences in the film
, forced the filmmakers to
" cut a long tsory short
"
and make it more of an action film than anything alse
( it
' s still summer
,
and movies have to be
" marketable
"
)
. the special effects too
, are really nothing for anyone to shout baout
. at most
, i would say the beast
- men looked jstu a bit more realistic than those apes in planet of tghe apes
. this h
. g
. wells classic really has potential to be a good film
. unfortunately
, aftter 2 adaptations
, they still could not decide on how
and what to focus their attention on to really bring out that importamt message which mkaes up the entire esence of the story
. as a third outing
, thte isl
and of dr
. moreau accomplishes little
and is nothing more thna an inferior version of
` the planet of the apes
'
