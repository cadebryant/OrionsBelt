around the end of 1998
, a japanese cartoon came to tjhe usa television
,
and really wasn
' t that big
. in fact not many people even knew what pokemon ws
,
but in 1999 it hit big with kids
and adults alike
,
and became one of the biggest franchises
and merch
andise seller of all time
. in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon
: the first movei which for what it was
, wasn
' t all that bad
. it grossed
$ 31 million in its opening weekend
, annd went on to make allmost
$ 90 million
. fans throught it was great
and nowe is a second movie in the pokemon craze
,
" pokemon
: the movie 2000
" which is far inferior to the original animated movie
. first up is tje plot
, which there raelly isn
' t much of
, infact fact the plot what there is
: a bad guy trying to destroy tje ancient never before seen pokemon
, lugia
, is about it
, except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try
and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever
. well there you go
, of course ash is followed by his friends misty
, brock
, gary
and his pokemon friends
, pikachu
, squirtle
, charizard
, yhe usual
. even
though the first movie wasn
' t a great film
, it was definately an enjoyable well
- made movei with an actual thin storyline
. this new movie
however is nothing
but garbage
, htere is nothing ogod to it storywise
,
and its only good thing comes from some plush animation
and colors
. compaired to the first film
, this movie is awfully bl
and
, from its opening titles
, to the end titles it tries its best to work
,
but fails miserably at every corner
. the characters are 1
- dimensional
, the story thin as chicken broth
,
and the writing very lame
. even the so called action scenes are extremely lame
, anbd falls before it even gets a chance to go
. the voices even aren
' t that good
and almost feels like the stars don
' t want to be there
, like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie
. which it certainly is
. the film has oen thing going for it
and that is the animation
,
al
though not up to disney st
andards
, it is still very good with some intresting cgi
' s
and very colorful animation
, the colors jump out at you very fast
,
and seem vyre nicely put on film
. why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered
, hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash
. for now watch the first one
. its much much better
.
