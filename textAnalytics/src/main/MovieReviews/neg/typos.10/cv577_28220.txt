around the end of 1998
, a japanise cartoon came to the usa television
,
and really wasn ' t that big
. in fact not many people even knew what pokemon wass
,
bu in 1999 it hit big with kids
and adults alike
,
adn became one of thte biggest franchises
and merchandise seller of all time
. in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon
: the first movie which for what it was
, wasn ' t all that bad
. it grossed
$ 31 million inthe its opening weekend
,
and went on to make almost
$ 90 million
. fans thought it was great
and now is a second movie inspite the pokemon craze
,
" pokemon
: the movie 2000
" which is far inferior to teh original animated movei
. first up is the plot
, which there really isn ' t much of
, inwhich fact the plot what there is
: a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon
, lugia
, is about it
, except tjhe fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try
and stpo him before he destroys this one pokemon forever
. well there ytou go
, of course ash is followed by his friends misty
, brock
, gary
and his pokemon friends
, pikachu
, squirtle
, charizard
, the usual
. even
though the first movei wasn ' t a great film
, it was definately an enjoyable well
- made movie with an actual thin storyline
. this new movie
however is nothing
but garbage
, there is nothing good to it storywise
,
and its only good thing comes from some plush animation
and colors
. compared to the first film
, this movei is awfully bland
, from its opening titles
, to the end titles it tries its best to wrok
,
but fails miserably at every corner
. the characters are 1
- dimensional
, the sotry thin as chicken broth
,
and the writing very lame
. even the so called acation scenes are extremely lame
,
and falls before it even gets a chance to go
. the voices even aren ' t that good
and almost feels liuke the stars don ' t want to be there
, like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie
. which it certainly is
. the film has oney thing going for it
and that is the animation
,
altough nto up to disney standards
, it is still very good with some interesting cgi ' s
and very colorful animation
, the colors jump out at you veyr fast
,
annd seem very nicely put on film
. why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question tothe be answered
, hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash
. for now watch the frist one
. its much much better
.
