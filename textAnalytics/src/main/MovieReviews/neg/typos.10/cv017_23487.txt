so what do you get when you mix together plot elements from various successfull sci
- fi films such as close encounters of the third kind
, 2001
: a space odyssey
, apollo 13
and contact
? well
, whatever it is
, you
' d sure as hell hope that it woudl be a thous
and times better than this shoddy attempt at such a melange
, considering the disastrous results we
' re left with here
. this is a film that takes a little bit ofthe everyting
,
but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing
! it
' s like i said
.
.
. this movie sucks
. plot
: a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020
, after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit thte red planet
. critique
: extremely underwhelming is tje best way to describe this movie
. uneven
, would be another
. the trailer for this movie actually showed some promise
, the buzz around it had been so
- so
,
and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes
, all leading you to believe taht it
' s actually going to go
" somewhere
"
.
but it isn
' t long before the entire movie downshifts into nutral
, features more space walks than anything intresting on the cherry
- colored planet
, tries too hard to get us into the
" pain
" of some its characters
and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix
. in a sci
- fi movie
? well
, i don
' t know
, much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon for about an hour adn a half
, only to figure out some big escret in the end
, a secret which practically had me yawning with excitement
. ultimately
, this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise
, joins the crew in their
" misadventures in space
" for the main crux ofthe its journey
,
and eventually settles down for one of the most anti
- climactic endings thsi side of contact
. mind you
, if you enjoyed that film
' s shrug
- of
- the
- shoulders ending
, you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well
. of course
, i don
' t remember contact having such obvious
and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story
. ugh
. what a friggin
' mess
. films like thsi generally get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again
. didn
' t anybody recogize the crappiness in this script
? didn
' t they read the bad dialogue
, the cheezy lines
, the obvious derivative nature of thge work
( mind you
, wiht a director like depalma at the helm
, that ain
' t saying much
!
)
. of course
, you can
' t really blame the brass for the inclusion of jerry o
' connell in this fine crew of thespians
.
' nuff said
. neither can you blame them for depalma cranking up the juice on the film
' s musical score during the last fifteen minutes
, presumably in order to wake the audience up
( okay
, we get it brian
, this scene is supposed to be powerful
.
.
. wow
.
.
. yawn
.
.
. my ears hurt
!
)
. so isnt anything salvageable in this movie
? sure
. gary sinise does another great job
, as doesnt cheadle
, the film doesn
' t completely bore you as much as it just moves along slowly without anything really intresting happening
,
and yes
, the
" s
and
- twister
" effect that you see in the commercial is well done
. other tahn that
? i guess i coudl say that i admire how filmmakers have become so much moreso devious infact their product placement strategies
.
.
. oops
, did i say
" admire
"
, i meaned
" am disgusted
"
! all infront all
, this movie delivers very little in actual substance
, offers two
- bit dialogue masked in a lot of sci
- fi mumbo
- jumbo
, pretends to be deep when really it
' s just sappy
,
and eventually just settles into an endig which
, other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story
, gives us littel mroe to think about than how we might be able to get our money back fo sitting through this rehashed dreck
. go see the ninth gate
.
.
. now there
' s a great movie
!
and on a personal note
, i think it
' s time for depalma tothe stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12
- minute uninterrupted film sequences
,
and start worrying moreso about how crappy his movies are getting
.
