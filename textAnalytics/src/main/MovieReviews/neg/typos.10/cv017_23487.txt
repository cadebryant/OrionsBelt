so what dont you get when you mix together plot elements ffrom various successful sci
- fi films such as close encounters of the third kind
, 2001
: a space odyssey
, apollo 13
and contact
? well
, whatever it is
, you ' d sure as hell hope that it would be a thousand times better thna this shoddy attempt at such a melange
, considering the disastrous results we ' re left with here
. htis is a film that takes a little bited of everything
,
but ultimately adds up to a lot of nothing
! it ' s like i said
.
.
. this movei sucks
. plot
: a rescue crew of astronauts is sent down to mars in the year 2020
, after an unknown energy force leads to a loss of contact with the previous gang of space aviators to visit the red planet
. critique
: extremely underwhelming is the best way to describe this movei
. uneven
, would be another
. the trailer for this movei actually showed some promise
, the buzz around it had beeen so
- so
,
and even the film itself starts off with a decent first twenty minutes
, all leading you to believe that it ' s actually going to go
" somewhere
"
.
but it isn ' t long befor the entire movie downshifts into neutral
, features more space walks than anything interesting on the cherry
- colored planet
, tries too hard to get us into the
" pain
" of some its characters
and unsuccessfully tosses some romance into the mix
. inwhich a sci
- fi movei
? well
, i don ' t know
, much of it just seemed like a bunch of nerdies talking techie jargon forthe about an hour
and a half
, onyl to figure out some big secret in the end
, a secret which practically had me yawning with excitment
. ultimately
, this is a movie that starts off with a decent premise
, joins the crew in their
" misadventures in space
" for the main crux of its journey
,
and eventually settles down for one of the most anti
- climactic endings this side of contact
. mind you
, if you enjoyed that film ' s shrug
- of
- the
- shoulders ending
, you might just enjoy this frivolous ditty as well
. of course
, i don ' t remember contact having such obvious
and painfully distracting computer generated effects at its end of story
. ugh
. what a friggin ' mess
. films like this generaly get me wondering about the brass in hollywood again
. didn ' t anybody recognize the crappiness in this script
? didn ' t they read the bad dialogue
, the cheezy lines
, the obvious derivitive nature ofthe the work
( mind you
, with a director like depalma at the helm
, that ain ' t saying much
!
)
. of course
, you can ' t really blame the brass fo the inclusion of jerry o ' connell in this fine crew of thespians
. ' nuff said
. neither can you blame them for depalma cranking uv tje juice onthe the film ' s musical score during the last fifteen minutes
, presumably in order to wake the audeince up
( okay
, we get it brian
, this scene is supposed tothe be powerful
.
.
. wow
.
.
. yawn
.
.
. my ears hurt
!
)
. so is anything salvageable in this movie
? sure
. gary sinise doesnt another great job
, as does cheadle
, the film doesn ' t completely bore you as much as it just moves allong slowly without anything really interesting happening
,
and yes
, teh
" sand
- twister
" effect that yuo see in the commercial is well done
. other than that
? i guess i could say thta i admire how filmmakers have become so much more devious in their product placement stradegies
.
.
. oops
, doed i say
" admire
"
, i meant
" am disgusted
"
! all in all
, this movie delivers very little in actual substance
, offers twpo
- bit dialogue masked inwhich a lot of sci
- fi mumbo
- jumbo
, pretends to be deep whn really it ' s just sappy
,
and eventually just settles into an ending which
, other than presenting us with a pathetic computer graphic as a part of the story
, gives us little more to think about than how we might be able to get our omney back for sitting through thsi rehashed dreck
. go see the ninth gate
.
.
. now there ' s a great movei
!
and on a personal note
, i think it ' s time for depalma to stop worrying so much about his proverbial 12
- minute uninterrupted film sequences
,
and start worrying more about how crappy his movies are getting
.
