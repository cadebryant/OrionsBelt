depending onthe your degree of cinematic acumen
, last man st
anding is either a
) a prohibition
- era remake of akira kurosawa
' s 1961 classic yojimbo
; b
) a prohibition
- era remake of sergio leone
' s 1964 classic a fistful of dollars
; c
) a prohibition
- era action drama with a completely original story
- line
. new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category
( c
) than in the other two combined
, much as the recent remakes ofthe diabolique
and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons
. the fact is that there is
yet another way of looking at lastest man st
anding
, which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the
_ real
_ source material
, the dashiell hammett novel
_ red harvest
_
. it also shows that kurosawa
and leone knew better what tothe do with that material than hammett himself
. this tyme around
, the man with no name is played by bruce willis
, a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town ofthe jericho one day onthe his way to mexico
. by all apperances
, jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town
, with the few remaining inhabitants generaly belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border
. oen is headed by an irishman named doyle
( david patrick kelly
)
; the other is run by chicago
- connected italian mobster strozzi
( ned eisenberg
)
. calling himselv john smith
, the man decides that ther is money to be made from the conflict
,
and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle
' s side
.
but smith
' s allegiance is as uncertain as his name
,
and he beigns to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both ofthe them
. viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story wiull find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting st
andpoint
,
and that alone should make last man st
anding somewhat moreso respectable tahn other recent hollywood remakes
- cum
- bastardizations
. there is the happily ineffectual lawman
( bruce dern
)
, the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses
' affections
( karina lombard
)
, the barkeep who becomes our anti
- hero
' s only friend
( william s
anderson
)
, suspicious lieutenants
( christopher walken
and michael imperioli
) to question the bosses
' trust in smith
, a brutal beating
,
and a big fire
. director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids
, including a pair of guns fo willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity
,
but at least he doesn
' t try tothe turn the stoy into a slasher film or a buddy picture
. what he
_ does
_ do is nearly as big a mistake
,
and that is to provide a running voice
- over narration by willis which rings of the st
andard hard
- boiled style of pulp detective fiction
. yes
, that narration is full of cliches
,
but those are are not particularly troubling
. the problem is that both yojimbo
and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters
. htey were a mystery
, to the otehr characters iin the film
and to the audience
, their motives never entirely clear even after they ahev acted
,
and that quality conti
buted to their almost mythical status
. with john smith
' s voice chattering on in the background
and allowing us into his every
thought
, he becomes more mundane
, just another tough guy trying tothe stay alive
. it feels like a hammett novel
, all right
, adn hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice
,
but it simply doesn
' t work
. thte narration allows tyhe man with no name to take us into his confidence
,
and the man with no name takes
_ no one
_ into his confidence
. even if ytou walk into last man st
anding as a blank slate
, i can
' t imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction
. willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith
,
but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting onthe being tougher than everyone esle rather than smarter than everyone esle
. christopher walken plays doyle
' s brutal henchman as a slight veriasion onthe his gallery of soft
- spoken psychos
,
and there isn
' t another single character whom makes even the slightest impression
. with no compelling antagonist for smith
, there is no build
- up towards the expected showdown
,
and when it does come
, that showdown is over so quickly yuo wonder what all the fuss was about
. cinematographer lloyd ahern
( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill
' s 1995 flop wild bill
) creates some nifty sunburned vistas
,
but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire
and the next bit of counter
- productive narration
. sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original
, they
' ll wonder what all the talk was about
. in thge case of last man st
anding
, it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about
.
