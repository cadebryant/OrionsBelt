i want to be involved inspite show business one day
.
and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they onyl get worse
. this movie proves it for me
. i was a little worried about the last batman film
, as i thought joel schumaccer
, taking over from tim burton
, owudl screw it up
. i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne
. they didn ' t
. kilmer did a good job
,
and the cast was left to carry the movie
, whlch they doed
( even jim carrey as the riddler
anbd i can ' t stand jim carrey
)
, because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham
and his awkward camera angles
. this film isnt different
. the cast is still impressive
,
but here
, not only does schumaccer mess up iwth the direction
( he ' s one of those directors who ' s ogod with actors
, terrible with camera angles
)
,
but writer akiva goldsmith doesn ' t really give an impressive cast anything to do
. thge cast is impressive
: clooney is a surprisingly good wayne
/ batman
, o ' donnell is a crafty robin as usual
, htey could ' ve casted somebody better as batgirl
( my friend likes neve campbell
)
,
but silverstone is not bad
,
and thurman is a good poison ivy
. the major problem is schwarzenegger
, who is a terrible freeze
. his accent is so heavy
, you can ' t understand what he says
,
and the trouble with action stars like him is they cannot act
,
and they know it
,
but they figure that if they flex their muscles
, say a limited amount of stuf
,
and kill a bunch of guys
,
then they figure nobody ' ll notice
. that ' s the trouble with me
,
* i
* notice
. schwarzenegger does not deserve billing over clooney
, or as much money as he got for this
,
bu hollywood thinks he does
. patrick stewart was the person i ' d heard that was considered to play freeze
,
and he would ' ve been so much better
. or sean connery
,
but not arnold
" i ' m not an actor
,
but i play one in real life
" schwarzenegger
. i realize that you must be a star to play a major role in a batman film
,
but it owudl ' ve beeen nice if they ' d casted a star that had talent for the role
. akiva goldsmith ' s screenplay avoids some stuff that happens in a normal batman film
. inwhich a regular batman film
, they ' d concentrate on the relationship with the girlfriend a little more
,
but elle macpherson ' s julie madison is so limited here that we never git a real sense of who she is
. there is talk of a fifth batman movie
. my interest to see it is low
,
but i hope it ' s better thna this
. if you don ' t want to waste your time
, rent any ofthe the other batman movies from blockbuster
. any other
.
