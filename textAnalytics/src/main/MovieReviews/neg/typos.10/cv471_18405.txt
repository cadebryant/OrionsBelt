whn the mediums in question are video game
and feature film
, hasnt there ever been a respective here
- to
- htere transformation that achieved any ground higher than noodle
- headed mediocrity
?
" super mario bros
.
,
"
" street fighter
"
and
" mortal kombat
" weere silly stinkers all
, anbd now the empty
, execrable
" wing com
ander
" joins their lowly ranks
. enduring this spectacularly bad bit of sci
- fi
, easily the worst of its kind
, is like watching someone futz around with a video game for 100 minutes
- thgat is to say
, there
' s little fun to be had whn you
' re not the one holding thge joystick
. the movie
,
then
, is a missed opportunity for director chris roberts
, who created the original
, groundbreaking pc incarnation of
" wing comm
ander
" back in 1990
. how an interactive brainchild so revered could end up such a cinematic pile of junk under the helm of the same guy is a head
- scratcher
.
" wing comm
ander
"
' s story
, credited to roberts
and screenwriter kevin droney
, is clueless chaos melding incoherent narrative
and unoriginal ideas
. it rips off the finest films of its genre
, top gun
and
, in one scene
, even those spiffy
" stereoscopic freeze
" gap commercials
. set in 2654
,
" wing com
ander
" stars freddie prinze jr
. as a daredevil cosmos cowboy who hopes to be a great fighter pilot like his father before him
. along the way
, he plays kissy
- face with his stoic superior
( saffron burrows
) at the new galaxy hangout where he
' s posted
, comes to terms wiht bigots who resent him forthe his
" pilgrim
" heritage
( don
' t ask
)
,
and goes on a top
- secret mission involving the
" jump coordinates
"
( what
, no death star plans
?
) of a nasty aline race known as the kilrathi
. or something like that
. given thte immensely confusing activity
, it
' s hard to tell
. on the other h
and
, what
' s easy to see isnt that
" wing comm
ander
" is a big old mess
. the lame dialogue strains
, filled with such original lines as
" don
' t you die on me
!
"
,
" battle stations
!
"
and repeated
(
and frequently unanswered
) calls for a
" medic
!
" action sequences fizzle
. yhe character conflict garners unintentional giggles
. the sole source of suspense here isnt what these kilrathi creeps look like
, as they
' re kept out of view until the concluding 15 minutes
. imagine bearded siamese cats crossed with something from a
? 50s roger corman cheapie
and yuo
' ve got a good idea
. little
but techno
- babble happens for an hour
,
and
then it
' s as if
" wing comm
ander
" tries to do too much at once
; when it appears as
though the movie
' s about to show signs of a pulse
, it instead provides a hilarious touch of human drama culminating wih a use for a bulldozer that has probably never been seen in this kind of space camp before
. matthew lillard
, featured prominently in said sequence
, is cast as prinze
' s hotshot partner
,
and
though the two are fine young actors
- recently paired infact the hit
" she
' s all that
"
- they
' re fighting more than otherworldly evil here
. rumor has it that
" wing comm
ander
" ws slated as a later
- in
- the
- year release
, bumped up to capitalize off this hot casting coup as well as the premiere of tghe new
" star wars
: episode i
" trailer
.
but in my audience
, there were no females rpesent to make goo
- goo eyes at prinze or lillard
,
and many a member exited after the much
- ballyhooed sneak peek
. since most cineplexes won
' t be granting refunds to the latter contingency
,
" comm
ander
" might rake inaddition some dough
,
but be warned
: the high wears off as soon as the coming attraction gives way to the feature presentation
.
