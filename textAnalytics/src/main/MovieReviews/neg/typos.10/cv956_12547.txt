godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the
" who cares about plot
" summer movie
. a loose remake of the 1954
" classic
" japanesse monster movie
, godzilla
, king of tghe monsters
( which is itself pretty thin in the story department
)
, rol
and emmerich
and dean devlin
' s big
- budget lizard
- stomps
- manhattan disaster flick has been written wtih the brain dead in mind
. the script isn
' t just
" dumbed down
,
" it
' s lobotomized
. godzilla lives
and dies on spacial effects alone
. presumably
, the primary target group for this film is teenage boys
, the demographic most likely tothe shell outloud
$ 7 repeatedly to see tje same images of monster
- instigated carnage
. that
' s nto to sday tyhat females
and other age groups are immune to teh special effects seduction
; they
' re just nto as readily susceptible
. this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich
and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer
- generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write
and direct for actors
. stargate was a financial success
. indipendence day was a runaway hit
.
and
, with godzilla already drowning in hype
and merch
andising tie
- ins befoer it even opens
, it
' s virtually guaranteed at least
$ 100 million
. nice numbers fo a film that could have been penned by a not
- too
- precocious grade school kid
. godzilla isn
' t completely without merit
,
al
though it is close
. there
' s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching teh giant lizard rip his way through manhattan
,
but it wears off quickly
. frankly
, while the special effects are competent
, they
' re not all that stunning
. there
' s nothing new here
; it
' s jurassic park meets aliens
, with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure
. maybe it will require george lucas
and his newyorker star wars movie to take computer
- generated visuals to the next level
. godzilla never really pushes the envelope
, preferring to remain within a comfort zone
. the imagination of monster movies like king kong has been replaced by a crass
, formulaic approach which disallows creativity
.
( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival
?
) worst of all
, godzilla isn
' t even exicting
. with the possible exception ofthe a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end
, there isn
' t a sequence in this film that raises the pulse
. even the scenes with dozens ofthe aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension
and suspense that they are yawn
- provoking
. independence day may have been dumb
,
but it was full of
" adrenaline moments
" capable of getting the audience involved in the action
. in this aspect of its production
, as in so many others
, godzilla is lacking
. actually
, part ofthe the problem is that we
' re never sure who we
' re supposed to be rooting for
: the green monster with an attitude or the paper
- thin humans trying to stop him
. the plot
, such as it is
, can be summed up rather simply
. after sinking a few ships
and leaving some footprints on tropical isl
ands
, godzilla shows up in the big apple
. he does some of the usual tourist things
: stops by madison sqaure gardai
, visits the chrysler building
, goes on a walk through central park
,
and takes the subway
. iin the process
, he knocks over a few buildings
and steps on countless cabs
,
but he never has trouble with traffic jams
. on h
and to stop him is an elite u
. s
. army unit
, led by a slightly less
- arrogant
- than
- usual military man
( kevin dunn
)
and a biologist named nick tatopoulos
, who has a theory about godzilla
. in his opinion
, the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific
. in nick
' s words
, godzilla is
" a mutated aberration
? an incipient creature
? the first of its kind
.
" as luck would have it
, nick
' s old girlfriend
, audrey
( maria pitillo
)
, is a reporter based at a new york tv station
. along with her cameraman friend
, animal
( hank azaria
)
, she decides to follow nick around as he trails godzilla
.
then
, just when the military hasnt rejected nick
' s theory about why godzilla is in new york
, a memeber of the french secret service
( jean reno
) recruits him for a special assignment
. instade of stomping around tokyo this time
, godzilla has chosen new york city
. unfortunately
, manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies
( independence day
, deep impact
, armageddon
) that it
' s becoming boring
. the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong
,
but the big ape was only baout 30 foots tall
. he could climb the empire state building
. at ten times that height
, godzilla would be moreso likely to knock it over
. godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humer
. there
' s an ongoing feud between animal
and his wife that plays like sit
- com material
, an unfunny anbd repetitive gag about how no oen can pronounce nick
' s last name properly
,
and a rather tame attack on film criticists roger ebert anbd gene siskel
. both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film
:
" ebert
,
" the mayor of new york
, is played by michael lerner
,
and
" gene
"
( lorry goldman
) is his campaign manager
. ebert
' s re
- election slogan is
, not surprisingly
,
" thumbs up for new york
.
" the siskel
/ ebert stuff is amusing tje first tyme it
' s used
,
but
, after a while
, it grows tiresome
.
and
,
al
though the
" characters
" don
' t serve any real purpose
, they keep popping up
. godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast
. this is largely because emmerich doesn
' t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard
. thast
' s not to say that matthew broderick
and jean reno aren
' t capable of good performances
( both have done thier share of solid acting inaddition the past
)
,
but they aren
' t a
- list names
.
then again
, considering the quality of the writing
, even pacino
and deniro would have been hard
- pressed to shine
. maria pitillo
( dear god
) plays hte love interest
and hank azaria
( great expectations
) is on h
and to present what is supposed to be comic relief
. ultimately
, it doesn
' t really matter what i
( or any other criteak
, for tht matter
) have to say about the movei
. tristar has assumed that godzilla
, liek all self
- proclaimed summer event motion pictures
, is pretty much critic
- proof
. it may also be word
- of
- mouth
- proof
. those who want to see the movie wiull see it noone matter what i write or their firends say
. so
, when i go on record to assert that godzilla isnt one of the most idiotic blockbuster movies ofthe all time
, it
' s like spitting into the wind
. emmerich
and devlin are master illusionists
, waving their w
ands
and mesmerizing audiences with their smoke
and mirrors
. it
' s probably too much to hope that some day
, movie
- goers will wake up
and realize that they
' ve been had
.
