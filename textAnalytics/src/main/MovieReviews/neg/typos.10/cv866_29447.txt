making your first feature film ain
' t easy
. assemple a decent
, if not
, strong cast
, as writer
/ director robert moresco has done with one eyed king
,
and you
' re already ahead of the game
.
but rehash old plot lines
, tired dialogue
,
and st
andard clich
? s
,
and a well
- intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film
. how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse
? the enormous catalog ofthe such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making
yet another
,
but here we have it
. agina
. five irish kids in nyc
' s hell
' s kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop
. with teary music
.
and slow motion
. in the film
' s first scene
. the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults
, unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen
. leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a ogod
- hearted guy who watches out for his buddies
and is in tight with local mob head arm
and assante
. i
' d like to say tath his character gets involved over his head inthe some sort of blah
, blah
, blah
,
but all we seem to get are littel tastes of possible plot points
. he
' s conserned about buddy jason gedrick
' s heroin abuse
. he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin
' s character
' s sister
. he looks inot who might be pushing thge most moronic
- looking counterfeit cash ever made
( a genuinely funny touch
)
.
but none of this ever really amounts to anything
. it seems that moresco
' s greater concern is to provide that intangible
" slice of life
"
, that flavor ofthe the neighborhood that everyone
' s been trying to evoke sicne scorsese
' s eary work
. so
, we get the drunk guys
, hugging
and singing together at yhe local bar
, to prove to us that they really love each other
.
( do people actually do this
!
?
) we get a lot of tough street talk
-
- usally mumbled fo effect
-
-
and a whole lot of the f
- word
, whether it sounds like it fits or not
. we allso get a h
andful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose
. bruno kirby
, chazz palminteri
, you know
, guys you
' ve seen in movies just like this one before
. assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears
,
and baldwin
' s performance is adequate
,
but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it
' s almost funny
. moresco
, a theater guy
and sometimes tv writer
( including the series falcone
)
, obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child
,
but the content is probably too personal
. as a result
, the movie
' s style is heavy
- h
anded
, in need of a considerable amount of toning down
. nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids
, moresco reminds us
-
- boy does he remind us
. with slow dissolves to the earlier scene
, running in slow motion
, complete with dialogue from the present
, just inspite case we don
' t comprehend the link to the past
. moresco needs to either trust his audience
' s intelligence
, or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it
. his next project should hve a little more personal distance
,
and a lot more subtlety
. if he actually gets that chance
. reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage
( feature story coming soon
)
