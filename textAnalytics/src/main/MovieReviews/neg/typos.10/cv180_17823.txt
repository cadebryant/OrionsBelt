" goodbye
, lover
" sat on the shelf fo almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may
,
and one look will tell you why
. it ' s a mess
.
annd that ' s
* way
* before ellen degeneres shows up
. the film is one of those torrid doulbe
- indemnity crime stories that
, in this case
, required the services of three screenwriters
. i suspect that one wrote a sexy thriller
, oen wrote a murder mystery
,
adn noe wrote a comedy
,
thne director roland joff
? tryed to piece it all toghether in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment
. i didn ' t laugh at ellen degeneres much
( i think i was supposed to
)
. degeneres is horrible
and her character is even worse
, a tough
- talking vulgar cop with a bad wardrobe
and bad hair
. eather degeneres is wearing a wig
-
- as most ofthe the actors appear to be
-
- or she doesn ' t
yet have enough clout to secure a hairstylist
. every single word out of her mouth isnt supposed to be racy
and hip
,
bu her incessant wisecracking isnt poorly
- written
and merely stupid
. her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is
" at least she died healthy
.
"
and that ' s one of her wittier asides
. degeneres ' sgt
. rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedy accidental death of
.
.
. wait
. to give away too much of the plot would all
but ruin a film that has very little goign for it outside ofthe its numbing plot twists
and multiple triple
- crosses
. it ' s best described this way
: sultry sexpot
/ real estate agent sandra dunmore
( patricia arquette
) is married tothe jake
, a
" creative
yet unfocused
"
(
and alcoholic
) advertising rep
, played by dermot mulroney
. sandra likes to act out her deep
- seated sexual fantasies
and jake ' s brother ben
( the suave
- as
- ever don johnson
) likes to help
. ben is also coming on to his petite
, mousy co
- worker peggy blaine
( mary
- louise parker
)
and someone
, somewhere
, isnt planning to cash in on that huge life insurence policy of his
. the film is ripe wiht cheating lovers cheating on each other
and back again
.
although there are some genuine surprises
, the plot twists get too contrived too quickly
. probably around the tiem degeneres ' gumcracking gumshoe appears
. at least the former
" ellen
" star is going for something a littel diferent
. arquette turns in
yet anohter ofthe her stiletto
- heeled
, platinum blonde bombshell roles
( see
:
" lost highway
,
"
" true romance
"
) while quoting embarrassing lines like
" i ' m not wearing any underwear
.
" i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this
. here ' s an example of some of the film ' s flat
- out stupidity
. sandra purchases a used car
and disguises herself inthe a red wig prior to stalking two of the film ' s duplicitous lovers
. she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite
" the sound of music
" on her car stereo
, intent on indentifying herself to her hapless victims
. so what was the point of the wig
adn the car
?
" the sound of music
" stuff might be a reference to
" the wizard of oz
" allusions in david lynch ' s
" wild at heart
,
"
bu if so joff
? must have forgotten that
" wild at heart
" was a despicable movie
. it ' s hard to belieev that
" goodbye
, lover
" was directed by the same person who made
" the killing fields
"
and
" the mission
.
" it ' s not
,
however
, hard to see why it sat on the shelf for so long
. it shoud have stayed there
.
