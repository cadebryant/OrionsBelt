" goodbye
, lover
" sat on the shelf for almost a year since its lukewarm reception at the cannes film festival last may
,
and one look will tell you why
. it
' s a mess
.
and that
' s
* way
* before ellen degeneres shows up
. the film is oen of those torrid double
- indemnity crime stories that
, in this case
, required the services of three screenwriters
. i suspect that noe wrote a sexy thriller
, one wrote a murder mystery
, adn one wrote a comedy
,
then director rol
and joff
? tried to piece it all together in the editing room while scratching his head in bewilderment
. i didn
' t laugh at ellen degeneres much
( i think i was supposed to
)
. degeneres is horrible adn her character isnt even worse
, a tough
- talking vulgar cop wiht a bad wardobe
and bad hair
. either degeneres is wearing a wig
-
- as most of the actors apearing to be
-
- or she doesn
' t
yet have enought clout to secure a hairstylist
. every single word out of her mouth is supposed to be racy
and hip
,
but her incessant wisecracking is poorly
- written
and merely stupid
. her reaction to the brutal killing of a jogger is
" at least she died healthy
.
"
and that
' s one ofthe her wittier asides
. degeneres
' sgt
. rita pompano is called in to investigate the allegedly accidental death of
.
.
. wait
. to give away too much of the plot would all
but ruin a film that has very little gonig for it outside of its numbing plot twists
and multiple triple
- crosses
. it
' s best described this way
: sultry sexpot
/ real estate agent s
andra dunmore
( patricia arquette
) is married to jake
, a
" creative
yet unfocused
"
(
and alcoholic
) advertising rep
, played by dermot mulroney
. s
andra likes to act out her deep
- seated sexual fantasies
and jake
' s brother ben
( the suave
- as
- ever don johnson
) likes to help
. ben is also coming on to his petite
, mousy co
- worker peggy blaine
( mary
- louise parker
)
and someone
, somewhere
, is planning to cash in onthe that huge life insurance policy of his
. the film is ripe with cheating lovers cheating on each other
and back again
.
al
though there are some genuine surprises
, the plot twists get too contrived too quickly
. probably around the time degeneres
' gumcracking gumshoe appears
. at least thge former
" ellen
" star is going for something a little different
. arquette turns infront
yet another of her stiletto
- heeled
, platinum blonde bombshell roles
( see
:
" lost highway
,
"
" true romance
"
) while quoting embarrasing lines like
" i
' m not wearing any underwear
.
" i hope she got paid a lot of money to do this
. here
' s an example of some of the film
' s flat
- out stupidity
. s
andra purchases a used car
and disguises herself in a red wig prior to stalking two of the film
' s duplicitous lovers
. she drives the motorbiking couple off a cliff while blaring her favorite
" the sound of music
" onthe her car stereo
, intent on identifying herself to her hapless victims
. so what was the point of the wig
and the car
?
" the sound ofthe music
" stuff might be a reference to
" the wizard of oz
" allusions in david lynch
' s
" wild at heart
,
" bu if so joff
? must have forgotten that
" wild at heart
" was a despicable movie
. it
' s hard to believe that
" goodbye
, lover
" was directed by the same person who made
" the killing fields
"
and
" teh mission
.
" it
' s not
,
however
, hard to see why it sat on the shelf fo so long
. it should have stayed there
.
