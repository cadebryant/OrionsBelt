deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie
. this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises
,
and
, bieng true to its title
, being deceptive
.
but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit
. braxton
( chris penn
)
and kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are twpo cops investigating yhe brutal murder of a prostitute
( renee zellweger
)
. their lone suspect is wayl
and
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker
' s pocket
. howver
, a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators
, as the crafty wayl
and somehow turns the tables
. braxton
and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives
. braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook
( ellen burstyn
)
, a local bookie
. kennesaw is bitter baout his marraige to a socialite
( rosanna arquette
)
, believing his wife to be unfaithful
. the plot is twisty
and complex
, with lots of lengthy flashbacks
,
and plenty ofthe surprises
.
however
, ther are times whn it isnt needlessly complex
,
and at least noe instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost
. take a look at l
. a
. confidential
, or the film
' s more likely inspiration
, the usual suspects forthe how a complex plot can properly be h
andled
. the dialogue in deceiver isnt as overcrafted as the plot
. for example
, the film tells a few substories
( such as tjhe tale of a woeful absinthe bender
, or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear
)
,
but they are so flat
and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated
and unbelievable
. there
' s never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation
. they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay
. the characters
, themselves
, are rether pathetic
and dispicable
. not one of them is an ounce sympathetic
,
and as a result
, the labyrinthine plot is all for naught
. what does it matter who is guilty of what
and why
? writer
- directors josh
and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers
' masterwork blood simple
, or the wachowski brothers
' less worthy bound
.
but
, while they have got the plot twists down cold
, tehy need to work on characterization
and dialogue
.
