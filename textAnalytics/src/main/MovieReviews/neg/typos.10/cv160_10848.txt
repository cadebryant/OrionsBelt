deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie
. this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises
,
and
, being true to its title
, being deceptive
.
but there isnt little in the film that is worthy of deceit
. braxton
( chris penn
)
and kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute
( renee zellweger
)
. their lone suspect is wayland
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker ' s pocket
.
however
, a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators
, as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables
. braxton
and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives
. braxton isnt a gambling addict in deepo to mook
( ellen burstyn
)
, a local bookie
. kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite
( rosanna arquette
)
, believing his wife to be unfaithful
. the plot is twisty
and complex
, with lots of lengthy flashbacks
,
and plenty of surprises
.
however
, there are times when it isnt needlessly complex
,
and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that tjhe answers to important plot points actually git lost
. take a look at l
. a
. confidential
, or the film ' s more likely insperation
, the usual suspects forthe how a complex plot can properly be handled
. the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot
. for example
, the film tells a few substories
( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender
, or an alternative telling ofthe how van gogh lost his ear
)
,
but they are so flat
and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated
and unbelievable
. there ' s never the sense that these are rela characters engaging in conversation
. they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay
. the characters
, themselves
, are rather pathetic
and despicable
. not one ofthe them is an ounce sympathetic
,
adn as a result
, the labyrinthine plot is all for naught
. what does it matter who is gilty of what
and why
? writer
- directors josh
and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers ' masterwork blood simple
, or the wachowski brothers ' less worthy bound
.
but
, hwile they have got the plot twists down cold
, htey need to wokr on characterization
and dialogue
.
