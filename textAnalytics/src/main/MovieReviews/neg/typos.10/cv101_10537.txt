my first press screening of 1998 adn already i
' ve gotten a prime c
andidate for my worst ten of the year list
. what an auspicious beginning
! welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders thast the studios opened in late desember in new york
and l
. a
.
and which are just now beginning to apear elsewhere
. firestorm
, tjhe directorial de
but of dances with wolves
' s academy award winning cinematographer dean semler
, is the first of the newyorker year
' s crop of movies
. as our story opens
, the movei pretentiously informs us that of tyhe tens of thous
ands of firefighters onyl 400 are
" smokejumpers
.
" we
then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys
and one cowgirl
, where one of the gung
- ho guys is taking a romance quiz from
" cosmopolitan
.
" having the tiome of their lives
, they
then jump into the middle of a burning forest
. when
, even in the beginning
, the director can
' t get the small parts right
, you can sense the movei is in trouble
. with the noisy fire roaring all about them
and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline
- filled cars
, smokejumper monica
( christianne hirt
) tells them to get away from their soon
- to
- explode vehicles
. not bothering to shout nor even get close to them
, she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people
. miraculously
, they manage to hear her
and move awya
. in a movie that specializes in cheap shots
, the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building
. as it does througout
, overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f
. windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl
' s face
. our sohw
' s two heroes
, the crew
' s chief
, wynt perkins
, played laconically by scott glenn
,
and his second
- in
- comm
and
, jesse graves
, played by howie long in a weak atempt to be the next steven seagal
, enter the burning hous looking for the little girl
. in a panic tehy have difficulty in locating her befor they are engulfed infact flames
. hte manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse
. this mawkish show cuts back to monica
, who has a life
- or
- death decision to make
. the chopper with tyhe fire
- retardant chemicals hasnt only enough to save one group
. will it be the large group near the cars or thte helpless little girl
and monica
' s two firefighting buddies
? she has only seconds to decide who will be saved
. yes
, she goes for the majority
,
but
, miracle of miracles
, tyhe other three come out alive anyway
. not content with a traditional firefighting story
, chris soth
' s screenplay attempts tothe jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named r
andy earl shaye who sets a forest frie so that he can join thge crew to put it out
and
then escape
.
(
" hoods in the woods
,
" is what yhe
" ground
- pounders
" yell out when the convicts are bused in tothe help them fight the fire
.
) along the way
, shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis
, who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father
, who was a marine drill instructor
. most ofthe the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing
. he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck
. arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside
. using a ramp
, he shoots straight out of the top of the building
' s attic
, anbd when he hits the ground
, he just rides off in a cloud of dust
. when the film isn
' t using some stock footage of actual forest fires
, the simulated ones look hokey
. editor jack hofstra cheapens the acation even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions
. the ending
, wiht its sick twists
, manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie
. perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is tje faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby
,
" it
' s not as bad as some of the television sitcoms
.
" firestorm runs mercifully just 1
: 29
. it is rated r for violence
and language
and would be acceptable forthe teenagers
.
