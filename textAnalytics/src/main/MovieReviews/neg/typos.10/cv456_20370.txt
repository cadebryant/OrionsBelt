there
? s nothing qutie like a gory anime
. raelly
,
and tihs is the truth
, no other genre in film gets away with such violence wihtout a word being said in the media about it
. with anime
, a common shot is watching a body getting quickly cut in two
,
and the rest ofthe the insides falling out seconds afterword
. this is a st
andard practice in anime
, or at least the half dozen or so titles tath i
? ve seen
. vampire hunter d isnt a gory
, gory film
. if tehy ever made a live version of the film
, it would be banned in several countires
and given a rating somewhere below xxx
. it
? s not that it
? s gore is unique
- it
? s just like other gory animes
-
but this one was supposed to st
and out because of the complexity it
? s story
, characters
, animation
, etc
.
.
. it really didn
? t
. it was disgusting anbd gruesome
, which overshadowed the story
, what littel of it there was
. it seems that infact the not too distant future vampires
and evil control the world
, because god knows that our local police force just cxan
? t seem to get a h
andle on vampires in the movies
. one evening
, a blond peasant girl
, drawn to look 17 annd innocent
( a foreshadow that we will see her naked
, i guessed early on it would be in the shower or in a rape scene
) is out fighting evil in her local forest preserve when she stumbles onto the private property of a ten thous
and year old vampire
( insert strom thurm
and joke here
.
) of course
, he never put a
? no trespassing
? sign onthe his yard
, so one can
? t realy blame her
,
but he
? s upset anyway
and dem
ands retri
bution
. she gets the obligatory bite on the neck
( aren
? t there otehr places to get blood from
? it seems like a bite in the elbow would do well enough
. if it
' s good enough for doctors tothe draw blood from
,
then why do vampires stray from that sight
?
) to fight the spell
, she enlists the help of a mysteriously tall
, dark adn h
andsome vampire hunter
( you guessed it
, his name is d
)
. yhe vampire hunter is torn between fighting vampires
, being attracted to the 17 year old peasant girl
and finding reasons not to talk too much
. you see
, like all heroes in these kinds of stories
, he
? s a brooder
, who
? s sole purpose in life is to remain really
, really silent
. when he speaks
, it
? s in cliches
. heroes like htis are bad when they
? re live
, even worse when animated
. later the vampire hunter storms hte castle to meet the big bad vampire
, who wants to marry the peasant girl because he
? s bored after 10
, 000 years of living
( the only clever vampire insight made in yhe movie
)
, will vampire hunter d rush to save her in time
? will we see blood
and intestines spattering on every palce imaginable
? in it
? s defense
, the animation
, wehn focusing on being original rather than recycling anime slicing
, could at times be original
. the tlaking h
and was clever
-
and i think tje inspiration for a skateboard
- related logo
.
and that
? s the best defense i can think of
. i underst
and that vampire hunter d is supposted to be a fave among anime fans
,
but i really don
? t see it
. it
? s an excuse to watch blood dripping fomr teeth
, blood exploding outloud of eye sockets
and horses necks
,
and most importantly
, like all voilent anime
, it is an excuse to see animated breasts
. why
? what is the point of tyhat
? mabey i have to underst
and the genre
and look past thge obsessive gore
and mysogny
. i
? m not a prude
, i just don
? t think it
? s warranted
. it puts itself so far out in front ofthe the movie that everthing else gets lost
. is there a neccesity in seing a 17 year old in the shower
? of course not
? it
? s done for shock
. it
? s tasteless
and despicable
.
