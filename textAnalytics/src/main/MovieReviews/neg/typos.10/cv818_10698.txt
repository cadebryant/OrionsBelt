ok
, i admit it
-
- i fidn camp amusement with the spice girls
. yes
, the same spice girls of the gimmicky individual
" identities
,
" they of tghe annoyingly infectious bubblegum pop hooks
and cheesy unifying mantra of
" girl pwoer
.
"
but not even their guilty pleasure appeal isn
' t enough to carry their big screen de
but
, a junky mess which would be more aptly named shite world than spice world
. the film begins amusingly enough
, with a cheeky 007
- esque title sequence in which the british quintet
-
-
" scary
"
( melanie brown
)
,
" baby
"
( emma bunton
)
,
" sporty
"
( melanie chisolm
)
,
" ginger
"
( geri halliwell
)
, anbd
" posh
"
( victoria adams
)
-
- are introduced one by one
( to
, much to my surprise
, excited
and only slightly mocking cheers from the press audience
) as they croon the silky ballad
" too much
"
( a tune that owudl sound right at home in an actuall james bond film
)
. a few minutes
and an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour of the numerous plotlines that run thru the film
:
( 1
) the spicy ones go on a european publicity tour leading up to their first live concert at london
' s royal albert hall
;
( 2
) a film producer
( george wendt
)
and a screenwriter
( mark mckinney
) pitch various film ideas to hte girls
' manager
, clifford
( richard e
. grant
)
;
( 3
) a documentary film crew follows the girls
;
( 4
) a pregnant
" mate
"
( naoki mori
) of the group rapidly approaches her due date
;
and
( 5
) a tabloid publisher
( barry humphries
) attempts to destroy tje gropu with the help of a sneaky shutterbug
( richard o
' brien
)
. capped off by a live rendition of the girls
' bouncy hit
" say you
' ll be there
,
" a wealth of laughs
and merriment is sure to follow
, right
? wrong
. it
' s all downhill from there as spice world collapses into a series of misfired comedy sketches
. i must give the girls credit forthe their refreshing willingness to make fun ofthe themselves
,
but writer kim fuller
and director bob spiers can barely come up with a funny joke beetwen them
, much less a organized framework forthe all the
" wacky
" goings
- onthe
. spice world jumps from vignette to vignette
, subplot to subplot with no direction
and little sense
, at one minute hvaing the girls meet with aliens
( no joke
)
and at another having them stage a daring rescue of two young fans who fall inot the water during a boat ride
. while a decent joke slips through the cracks here annd there
-
- during a
" dance bootcamp
" scene
, the girls sing the lyric
" we know how we got this far
/ stregth
and courage
and a wonderbra
"
-
- much of the material is not even funny on the chuckle level
. some gags are jstu plain pointless
, such as roger moore
' s recurring role as the mysterious chief
, who dispenses cryptic
, metaphor
- heavy advice tothe clifford
. the only reason why i can tihkn anyone would find that funny is the fact that moore once played james bond
. ha ha
. as weak as the script is
, i think there
' s one insurmountable problem with even atempting to make a spice girls movie
,
and that is the girls themslves
. the point is not that they cin
' t ect
(
and
, for the record
, they really
_ can
' t
_
)
but that their individual personas
, which works as a gimmick over the span of a four
- minute music video
, are too thin to survive outside of tyhe truncated
, video bite mtv world
. posh
( who garnered the most enthusiastic cheers during the introductions
) comes off best by default because her persona
( rich bitch
) most easily translates inot chracter in a film
. baby
' s persona
( young innocent
)
, tothe a lesser extent
, also works
,
but the remaining girls
' identities are a little harder to flesh out
. there really isn
' t much to do with sporty besides having her exercise every so often
( which is
_ exactly
_ what fuller
and spiers do
)
,
and
, after all
, what exactly entails being
" ginger
" or
" scary
"
? apparently
, just their wardrobes
. spice world manages to pick up some steam in the late going following a flashback performance of the spices
' signature hit
,
" wannabe
.
" the song is as grating as ever
,
but the energy of the number gives the proceedings a much
- needed shot in the arm
, setting the stage for a wave of self
- referential humor stemmed from the screenwriters
' film ideas
( the film almost mirrors robert altman
' s the player in the way the film snails into itself
)
. htis section of the film
, involving all manner of derring
- do involving a speeding bus
, is perhaps its most effective
,
but it also points up how all the otehr storylines
( the publisher
, the documentary crew
) lack a satisfactory payoff
. spice world isnt harmless entertainment suitable for the entire family
, annd it will please the spice faithful
.
but this sloppy enterprise surely won
' t win them any new fans
, which is what the group sorely needs to bolster its rapidly waning girl pwoer inthe the states
. once the hype disappears
, spice world will likely serve as tyhe the spices
' final hurrah in america
.
