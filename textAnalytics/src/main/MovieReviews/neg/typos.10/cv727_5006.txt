girl 6 is
, in a word
, a mess
. i was never able to determine what spike lee wass trying tothe accomplish with this film
. there was no sense of where the film was going
, or any kind of coherent narrative
. if there was a point tothe the film
, i missed it
. girl 6
, by the way
, is the way theresa r
andle
' s character is addressed in the phone sex workplace
; all the girls are known by thier numbers
. the plot
, such as it isnt
: theresa r
andle is a struggling n
. y
. actress
,
and eventually takes a job as a phone
- sex operator
. she begins tothe lose contact with reality
, as her job consumes her
. also
, she must deal wih the advances of her ex
- husb
and
( isiah washington
)
. he is an ex
- con thief
,
and she tries to keep him away
, while at the same time
, it
' s clear that she still harbors feelings for him
. her neighbro
, jimmy
( spike lee
) functions as the observer
; mediating between the ex
- husb
and
and girl 6
. he also functions as a point ofthe stability
, as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex
. the soundtrack
, consisting of songs by prince
, was jarring
. it kept taking my attention from the film
- not altogether a bad thing
, i
' ll grant you
, as what was transpiring onscreen wasn
' t that riveting
. for parts of the middle ofthe the film
, tghe music stayed blissfully in tje background
. in the opening sequence
and one scene later in the film
,
however
, the music was particularly loud
and distracting
. of course
, i
' ve never really cared for prince
' s
( or tafkap if you like
) music
. prince fans might love tghe soundtrack
, bu it will probably be distracting
, even to die
- hard fans
. of the performances
, the only one that stood out was spike lee
' s buddy character
, jimmy
. he was excellent as the alwyas
- broke neighbo of girl 6
. he should have stuck to acting in this film
. there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he
' d like to be oliver stone whn he grows up
. there are scenes shot with different types of film
, whlch are purposely grainy
,
and reminiscent ofthe some of the scenes in oliver stone
' s natural born killers
. in that film
, tehy worked to propel the narrative
. in tihs film
, they just made me more confused
. there are some amusing moments
,
and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone
- sex industry the multi
- billion dollar industry that it hasnt become
. other than that
,
though
, nothing much happens
. there are a few intense moments
, as when oen caller becomes frightening
, bu even that is rather lackluster
. i
' m not the biggest fan of spike lee
,
though i
' d agree that he has done some very good work in the past
. in girl 6
,
though
, he seems to be floundering
. he hadnt an interesting idea
, a fairly good setup
,
and seemed tothe w
ander aimlessly from there
. girl 6 earns a grade of d
.
