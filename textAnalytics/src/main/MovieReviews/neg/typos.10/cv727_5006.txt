girl 6 is
, in a word
, a mess
. i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film
. there ws no sense ofthe where the film was going
, or any kind of coherent narrative
. if there was a point to the film
, i missed it
. girl 6
, by the way
, isnt the way theresa randle ' s character is addressed in the phone sex workplace
; all the girls are known by their numbers
. the plot
, such as it is
: theresa randle is a struggling n
. y
. actress
,
and eventually takes a job as a phone
- sex operator
. she begins to loose contact with reality
, as her job consumes her
. also
, she must deal with the advances of her ex
- husband
( isiah washington
)
. he is an ex
- con thief
,
and she tries to keep him away
, while at the same time
, it ' s clear that she still harbors feelings forthe him
. her neighbor
, jimmy
( spike lee
) functions as the observer
; mediating between the ex
- husband
adn girl 6
. he also functions as a point of stability
, as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex
. the soundtrack
, consisting of songs by prince
, was jarring
. it kept tkaing my attention from the film
- not altogether a bad hting
, i ' ll grant you
, as what wass transpiring onscreen wasn ' t that riveting
. for parts of the middle of the film
, tyhe music stayed blissfully in tjhe background
. in the oppening sequence
and one scene later in the film
,
however
, the music was particularly loud
and distracting
. of course
, i ' ve never really cared for prince ' s
( or tafkap if you like
) music
. prince fans might love tje soundtrack
,
but it iwll probably be distracting
, even to die
- hard fans
. of thte performances
, the only one that stood out was spike lee ' s buddy character
, jimmy
. he ws excellant as the always
- broke neighbor of girl 6
. he should have stuck to acting in this film
. there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he ' d like to be oliver stone when he grows up
. htere are scenes shot with different types of film
, which are purposely grainy
,
and reminiscent ofthe some of the scenes in oliver stone ' s natural born killers
. in that film
, they worked to propell the narrative
. in this film
, they just made me moreso confuzled
. there are some amusing moments
,
and a few insights into the lives ofthe the womens who ule their voices to make the phone
- sex industry the multi
- billion dollar industry that it has become
. otehr thna that
,
though
, nothing much happens
. there are a few intense moments
, as when one caller becomes frightening
,
but even that is rather lackluster
. i ' m not the biggest fan ofthe spike lee
,
though i ' d agree that he has done some very good wokr inspite the past
. in girl 6
,
though
, he seems to be floundering
. he had an interesting diea
, a fairly good setup
,
and seemed to wander aimlessly from there
. girl 6 earns a grade of d
.
