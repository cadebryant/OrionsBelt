the only two really good thigns that i can say baout tarzan
and the lost city are as follows
: jane march was very cute as jane
,
and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes iin length
. if you haven ' t already figured it out
, i didn ' t like this movie very much
. the plot was boring
and contrived to the extreme
. tarzan
( casper van dien
) has now left the jungle
and living in civilized society
. he is jsut days away from his impending marriage to jane
, played by the aptly named jane march
. bakc in his fromer home of africa
, a gropu ofthe looters has foudn the key to locating a lost city
.
( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to fidn this city
.
) anyway
, tarzan ' s old jungle friend appears tothe him inwhich a vision
. tarzan realizes that he must return to africa tothe help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city
. he leaves jane
( his first mistake
, in my oppinion
)
and travels to africa
. of course
, jane is hot on her ape man ' s heals
. the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys
. soudn like a dumb explanation of the plot
? it ' s actally an improvement over the real thing
. the acting is just plain awful
. i ' m not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film
,
but it wasn ' t acting
. jane march wasn ' t a heck of a lot better
,
but at least she is easy on the eyes
. compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places tyhe dialogue had obviously been re
- recorded
,
and i ' ve seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies
. added to the sound problems wass the cinematography
. this film was filled with beautiful african scenery
.
but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me
. quite frankly
, i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than tihs bunch did with professional film equipment
.
then we have the special effects
.
" special effects in a tarzan movie
?
" you are no doubt asking youself
? yes friends
, the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story
. probably for the sake ofthe using cgi
, since it did nothing
but hurt the story
. in most parts
, they weren ' t bad
, just nothing special
.
but
, they were more than a little on the hokey side
. exept of course
, when we got tothe the ridiculous climax of this movie
. the grand finale ' s special effects went right into the toilet at taht point
. it almost looked like they had run out of money
. these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in yhe rest of tjhe film
and looked like something infront an amateur video production
. i took one lesson away fomr watching tarzan
and tjhe lost city
-
- ape men
and bones that morph inot skeletal warriors don ' t mix
. stay far away from this version of tarzan
.
