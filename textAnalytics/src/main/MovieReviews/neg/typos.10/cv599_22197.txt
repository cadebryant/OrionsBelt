the only two really ogod things that i can say about tarzan
and the lost city are as follows
: jane march was very cute as jane
,
and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length
. if you haven
' t already figured it out
, i didn
' t like tihs movie very much
. the plot was boring anbd contrived tothe the extreme
. tarzan
( casper van dien
) has now left the jungle
and living in civilized society
. he is just days away from his impending marrige to jane
, played by tyhe aptly named jane march
. back in his fromer home of africa
, a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city
.
( mind you i never really figured out why they actally wanted to find this city
.
) anyway
, tarzan
' s old jungle friend appears to him in a vision
. tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city
. he leaves jane
( his first mistake
, in my opinyon
) annd travels to africa
. of course
, jane is hot on her ape man
' s heals
. the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle whith the bad guys
. sound like a dumb explanation of the plot
? it
' s actually an improvement over the real thing
. yhe acting is just plain awful
. i
' m not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in thsi film
,
but it wasn
' t acting
. jane march wasn
' t a heck ofthe a lot better
,
but at least she is easy on the eyes
. compounding the bad acting ws the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re
- recoreded
,
and i
' ve seen better dubbing in some ood bruce lee movies
. added to the sound problems was the cinematography
. this film wass filled iwth beautiful african scenery
.
but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed tothe me
. quite frankly
, i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch doed with professional film equipment
.
then we have the special effects
.
" speshal effects iin a tarzan movie
?
" you are no doubt asking yourself
? yes friends
, the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story
. probablly fo the sake of using cgi
, since it did nothing
but hurt the story
. in most parts
, they weren
' t bad
, just nothing special
.
but
, they were moreso than a little on the hokey side
. except of course
, when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie
. the gr
and finale
' s special effects went right into the toilet at that point
. it almost looked like they hadnt run out of money
. these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in thte rest of the film
and looked like something in an amateur video production
. i took one lesson away from watching tarzan
and the lost city
-
- ape men
and bones that morph into skeletal warriors don
' t mix
. stay far away from this version of tarzan
.
