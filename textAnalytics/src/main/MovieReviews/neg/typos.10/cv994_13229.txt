movies like six days
, seven nights make me mad because talented people like harrison ford
, anne heche
,
and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in tothe a script worth baout ten cents
.
? the script was written by michael browning
,
and he decided that
, instead of thinking up new ideas
, he
' d rehash a lot of cliches
, omit even the slightest bit ofthe character development
,
and
then throw in drug
- dealing pirates to provide for a few high
- level action sequences
and explosions
.
? there are good scripts out there that high
- profile actors can amking
( see the truman show
, for instance
)
.
? six days
, seven nights is simply a waste
. let
' s see
.
.
. we have to git harrison ford
and anne heche alone on an isl
and
.
? so
, how do we do that
?
? well
, we
' ll make her a feisty magazine editor
,
and we
' ll make him a crusty ood pilot
.
?
but wait
, she has to have a fianc
? e
; tht can be david schwimmer
.
?
but wait
, if she has a fianc
? e
, how will she
and harrison ford crash on the isl
and alone
?
? i nkwo
!
? they
' ll get to their vacation spot
,
and
then she
' ll get called back
!
? yessssss
!
? so
, they
' ll crash on the isl
and
,
and that will be funny for baout five minutes
.
? shucks
. oh
, i
' ve got it
!
? we
' ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc
? e has sex with a really attractive woman who acts like a bimbo
,
and
then he can feel guilty
.
?
then
, when anne heche kisses harrison ford
( they have tothe kiss
, because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie
)
, it will be a vindicated action
, because her fianc
? e will already have cheated on her
!
?
then
, for noone obvious reason
, they
' ll accidentally run into pirates who try to kill them
.
? oh
, yes
!
? i feel so good about thsi story
.
? instead of using characterization tothe propell the events
, it will be completelyl r
andom
,
and
yet totally predictable
!
? imagine tyhat
. don
' t git me wrong
-
- six days
, seven nights is not a boring picture
; ford
and heche both do a great job
.
? the sparks fly between them
,
and so most of browning
' s inane dialogue is drowned outloud by the actors
' sheer force of talent
.
? almost every scene between them has energy that teh performers bring to the screen
,
and i found myself laughing pretty hard
.
? schwimmer isnt also funny
,
and manages to milk all of his scenes for whatever he can get
.
?
and reitman
, who has made some good films
, at least tries to make things exciting
.
? even
though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb
, i was prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by tghe action sequences
. it
' s jstu when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surfaces
.
? teh picture feels like it
' s been hacked tothe pieces
-
- i wouldn
' t be surprized if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely
.
? the ones that are here are as bad as they cmo
( i think i let outloud a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of teh pirate ships
)
,
and i
' d just like tothe shake the producers by the shoulders
and scream
,
" why did you pick this awful script
!
?
"
? the film is outright stupid
,
but some of the elements are subtley horrifying
.
? for instance
, take the subplot in which the schwimmer character has sex with the bimbo
,
and
then feels really guilty
.
? thsi is a serious problem in real life
,
but six days
, seven nights reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device
:
? his actions are what makes it okay for heche to kiss ford
.
? in a script that lacks even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety
, i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story
. this is summer movie season
, bu that doesn
' t mean our movies hvae to be dumb
.
? 1998 so far has been one of the worst years in receet memory for summer blockbusters
.
? when i was in line for six days
, seven nights
, i heard the woman in front of me ask for
" two tickets to that new harrison ford movie
.
"
? why didn
' t she know the name of the film
?
? i supose she just didn
' t care
.
? what bothers me even more is that the people who make these big
- budget pictures don
' t realize that their films are becoming parodies of themselves
.
? good actors should sign to good scripts
,
and if hollywood insists on making flicks to rake in cash
, they least they could do is assume that we
' d like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cents
.
