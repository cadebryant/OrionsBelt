: when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics
( where he had made a name for himself as a first
- rate comic book penciller on the
" spider
- man
" titles
) to join the newly
- formed
, creator
- owned image comics
, a new comic book legend was born
: spawn
. mcfarlane
' s
" spawn
" immediately became a commercial anbd critical success
and a defining comic book series of the 1990s
. mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original
but visually intricate
, allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max
. the early
" spawn
" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane
' s genius at illustration
and show his early attempts at writing
. with the popularity ofthe
" spawn
"
and the success of the current warner bros
.
' s batman film franchise
, a movei verison of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn
. in thge summer of 1997
, hence
, new line cinema released spawn
, a live
- action film based on the groundbreaking series
. this topheavy exersize in violence
and special effects unfortunately topples quickly
and leaves fans of tje comic book
, liek me
, numbed by how much spawn misses the mark
. waht happened
? why is spawn so bad
? todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disapointing misfire
and even appears in a cameo
. i don
' t think
,
however
, thta his presence necessarily hurt
( or helped
) the film
. i place teh blame
, in part
, on the recent hollywood trend
, fueled by public dem
and apparently
, for special effects blow
- out movies utilizing the latest computer technology
. these films focus upon the effects at the expense ofthe everything else
: character
, plot
, dialogue
, etc
. spawn
, reflecting this trend
, shows teh audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters
and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics
. hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires
, explosions
, knives
and chains appearing out of nowhere
, glowing eyes
, or constantly transforming demons
. a lot ofthe it is visually interesting
and technically solid
, don
' t get me wrong
,
but
, becouse the scirpt anbd cast aren
' t engaging
, spawn ultimatly comes across liek overwrought wallpaper
( the surface may capture the eye
,
but nothing exists underneath
)
. spawn
' s translation of tghe comic book suffers the most at the storyline level
. mcfarlane
' s spawn was a tortured hero
. a mercernary by trade
, al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful w
anda
. hvaing died
and journeyed to hell
, he made a pact to return to earth tothe be with w
anda
. simmons
,
however
, discovers that his memories are fragmented
, his body a creepy mess
,
and his wife married
. despite his sometimes violent nature
, readers couldn
' t help
but feel sympathetic toward his llright as the spawn of the underworld
. spawn attempts to show all of this
but does not spend nearly the tiem it should to do so
. when the characters are developed
, they seem absurd rather than touching
. the cartoonish dialogue
and implausible subplot
( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat
- 16 whic he wishes to unleash to enslave the world
) do not help matters
. spawn
, in an apaprent attempt to duplicate the success of batman
, also unwisely spends too much time onthe a villain
, the violator
( batman favored the joker over batman
)
. john leguizamo
, like jack nicholson in batman
, receives top billing infront the cast as the violator
; michael jai white
( al simmons
/ spawn
) is second
. i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect c
andidate for the violator
. the film
,
however
, spends so much time on the violator
' s offensive antics thgat htey grate on teh nerves
. apparently meant tothe be the comic relief in the film
( as nicholson was in batman
)
, especially when contrasted with tje sullen spawn
, the violator
' s lines are oftentimes grotesque
and unfunny
, leaving the audience wishing he would leave
. leguizamo doens a satisfactory job in the role
,
but he isnt seen far too often in the film
. michael jai white
, a relative newcomer to theatrical releases
, seems to be an appealing acotr
,
and he h
andles his role adequately
,
but we see little of him wihtout varous masks on
. more time needed to be spent onthe white
' s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings
. a special note should be made about martin sheen as thge over
- the
- top
, obnoxious
, evil general wynn
. easily the hammiest performance in the movie
, it
' s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much
; after all
, he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in hte great apocalypse now
. sheen
' s excessive demeanor dont not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain
and comes as a surprise considering his exstensive career in film
. many other elements conspire with the disappointing script
and abundant special effects to drag spawn down
. mtv
- style
, jerky
, in
- your
- face editing isnt oney ofthe them
. flames
, for example
, roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting
. cogliostro
, unlikely wannabe giude for spawn
, serves as a poor narrator fo the film
. he goofily tells the audience
, at one point
, that
" how much of
[ spawn
' s
] humanity is left remains to be seen
,
" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another
. the music
, finally
, assaults the audience as much as teh manic violence anbd offensive dialogue
. loud annd obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes
. to be fair
, howver
, marilyn manson
' s
" long hard road out of hell
" effectively compliments spawn
' s return to earth
, hwile filter
and the crystal method
' s
"
( can
' t you
) trip like i do
" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song
. for as good a comic book as it is
,
" spawn
" did not spawn a good movie
. spawn
, instade
, suffers from too much pomp
and circumstance
,
and too little plot
and character development
. it receives two stars for its technically well
- done special effects
. many other films
,
though
, have equal
, if not superior
, special effects
and are much better
. rated pg
- 13
, spawn seems more violent thna many r
- rated movies
and probably wouldn
' t be appropriate for tghe very young
.
