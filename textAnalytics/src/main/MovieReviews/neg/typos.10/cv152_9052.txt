there was probably a good reason that the warner bros
. studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film wehn it first oppened
.
and
, after seeing this piece ofthe toxic waste
, i now know why
. thsi movie is by far the worst offering that hasnt hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies eyars ago
. fire down below centers its story on a little mining twon in god
' s country
, somewhere in eastern kentucky
. it
' s beauty
and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring minning magnate
( kris kristopherson
, who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role
)
. it turns out that he
' s filling the mines throughout kentucky withthe toxic waste for a tidy profit
. seagal plays jack taggert
, an aikido
- versed
, fighting machine
, who is an agent witht the epa
. no
.
.
. not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa
. it
' s the environmental protection agency
. i hadnt noone idae that epa agents were trained to be killers
! taggert is sent tothe find the perpetrators
and to bring them tothe justice
. written by someone named jeb
, i sould alredy envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships
, banjo
- picking preachers
,
and dumb
- as
- nails rednecks
.
but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries tothe discreetly ift in
. seagal
' s idea of a disguise is a long
- length
$ 1000 leather jacket
.
but to get closer to the kinfolk
, he will fix people
' s porches for free
. that
' s another grat epa asset
- teaching agents how to fix porches
. slow
and plodding
, this project is a total mess
. the sometimes allure ofthe watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies taht outnumber
and outgun him like in under seige
. here
, his bravado basically turns into bullyness
. townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued
. fight scenes are quick
and senseless
and offers noone enjoyment value whatsoever
.
and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes
. the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle ofthe a sunday church ceromony
, gets behind the pulpit
,
and beseeches the townsfolk to take control ofthe their lives
and to halp clean up the environment
.
but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for thge toxic dumping
, kristopherson
, meets up with seagal
. kristopherson asks seagal how much it wiull take for him to go away
. seagal gallantly replies
:
" i
' ll leave when you take tyhe posion from the streams annd the earth
.
" i was expecting patriotic music to strat blasting
and a show of fireworks in tyhe background
. tihs is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal
' s righteousness anbd narcissistic arrogance
. seagal has been vanguard in trying tothe bring a new genre into the filmplace
, that of the enviro
- thriller
( on deadly ground
)
.
however
, the message will never come accros through poorly developed vehicles like this
. still
, i belieev in preserving mother earth
, so save your
$ 5
and please donate it instade to some worthy environmentally conceous charity
.
