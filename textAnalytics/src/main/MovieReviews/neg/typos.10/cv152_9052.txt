there was probably a good reason that the warner bros
. studio chose not tothe allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened
.
and
, after seeing this peice of toxic waste
, i nowe know why
. thsi movie is by far the worst offering thast has hit the screen usance possably those ernest movies years ago
. fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god ' s country
, somewhere in eastern kentucky
. it ' s beauty
and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate
( kris kristopherson
, who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role
)
. it turns out that he ' s filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit
. seagal plays jack taggert
, an aikido
- versed
, fighting machine
, who isnt an agent with the epa
. no
.
.
. not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa
. it ' s the environmental protection agency
. i had no idea that epa aggenst were trained to be killers
! taggert is sent to find the perpetrators
anbd to bring them to justice
. written by someone named jeb
, i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships
, banjo
- picking preachers
,
and dumb
- as
- nails rednecks
.
but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in
. seagal ' s idea of a disguise is a long
- length
$ 1000 leather jacket
.
but to get closer to the kinfolk
, he will fix people ' s porches for free
. that ' s another great epa asset
- teaching agents how tothe fix porches
. slow
and plodding
, this project is a total mess
. the somtimes allure ofthe watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber
and outgun him like in under seige
. here
, his bravado basically turns into bullyness
. townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued
. fight scenes are quick
and senseless
and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever
.
and his soap box message wears thin withing the first 15 minutes
. the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony
, gets behind the pulpit
,
adn beseeches tyhe townsfolk to take control of their lives
annd to help clean up the environment
.
but the epitome of how moralistically mushy thsi film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping
, kristopherson
, meets up with seagal
. kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away
. seagal gallantly replies
:
" i ' ll leave when you take the poison from the streams
and the earth
.
" i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting
and a show of fireworks in the background
. this is truly nothing more thna a pompous showcase for seagal ' s righteousness
and narcissistic arrogance
. seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace
, that of the enviro
- thriller
( on deadly ground
)
.
however
, the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this
. still
, i belieev in preserving mother earth
, so sive your
$ 5
adn please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity
.
