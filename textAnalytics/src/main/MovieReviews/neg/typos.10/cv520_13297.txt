i cried during
_ babe
_
. i admit it
. the special effects
, tyhe story
, the great dialogue were woven together so delicately
and successfully that my mind lost track tath this was a
" children ' s film
"
-
- so much so that
, yes
, i got a little overly sentimental
. such
, my friend
, is the pwoer of cinema
. when word cameback out that they were using this newly developed f
/ x for a doctor dolittle update
, in whic eddie murphy plays the title character
,
and many great comic actors supply the voices
, my anticipation rose to great expectations
. they can ' t possibly drop the ball onthe this oney
. can ' t miss
. can ' t possibly miss
. they missed
. what went wrong
? after much thought
, i supply threee general rules
.
( 1
) don ' t let a television actress
- turned
- comedy movie director near an urbanite script
( i
. e
.
, penny marshall ' s dreadful
" preacher ' s wife
"
)
. betty thomas worked wonders with
" the brady bunch movie
"
,
but the smae sitcom
- airiness doesn ' t quite owrk here
. it ' s as if she lifted a generic sitcom
,
and iced it with light doses of modern r
& b
. take awya the black cast
, take away the atrocious sountrack
,
and you have the residue of some mid
- 80 ' s kirk cameron show
.
( 2
) the greater the cast
, the less the individual cast
- member has to do
( i
. e
.
,
" con air
"
)
. it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman
, garry schandling
, john leguizimo
, ellen degeneres
,
and gilbert godfried in your lineup
,
but they have nothing to dont
but improvise their underdeveloped
, stereotyped characters
, one
- line
- at
- a
- time
. it ' s even worse
, because sometimes theri voices are so unrecognizable that yuo don ' t get the satisfaction of linking the voice tothe the comedian until the credits
. nowe there are three character actors who do get special treatment
: albert brooks brings dignity tothe nearly eveyr project he ' s in
,
and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy
. norm mcdonald fares nearly as well
, as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle
.
but there ' s little humor here
. thyat rests on the shoulders of chris rock
, sorely miscast
and unfunny as the voice of theri wise
- ass guinea pig
. even the mouth is ill
- synched
.
( 3
) don ' t let the special effects technicians walk away with the script
. there ' s a certain timing that ' s mandatory in comedy
. to ahve this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations ofthe jim henson ' s creature shop
, is a travesty
. this is not tothe say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren ' t well
- timed laughfests
; with the right directer
, they can be
and have
. here
, betty thomas is clearly over her head
. i wish i could commend the special effects
,
but they ' re merely average
. count the number of times where the animal ' s mouth is turned away from the camera
, or too far tothe notice
, or ill
- synched
. this is less a
" babe
"
and moreso of a
" look who ' s barking
" clone
. you may be wondering
, ' how does eddie murphy fare
? ' well
, he came back with the exceptional
" nutty professor
"
,
and i don ' t doubt he can come back again
. here
, he ' s tied into a straight man
and given little to do
. the exceptions are when he fears he ' s going crazy
: a far cry from his smarter
- thna
- you ' d expect routine that he ' s more adept at
. it ' s unfortunate thgat he is where richard pryor was ten years ago
, making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years
. after all this
, wqat ' s left
? butt jokes
. a
_ lot
_ of butt jokes
. i guess forthe kids that may be funny
,
but i was stone
- faced
. if there ' s a lesson the film may be telling us
, is that animals have feelings too
,
and they care way too much for your butt
.
