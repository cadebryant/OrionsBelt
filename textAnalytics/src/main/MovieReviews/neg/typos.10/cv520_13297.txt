i cried during
_ babe
_
. i admit it
. the special effects
, the story
, the great dialogue were woven together so delicately
and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a
" children
' s film
"
-
- so much so that
, yes
, i got a little overly sentimental
. such
, my friend
, is the power of cinema
. when word came outloud that tehy were using this newly devolopped f
/ x for a doctor dolittle update
, in which eddie murphy plays the title charactor
,
and many great comic actors suply the voices
, my anticipation rose to great expectations
. they cxan
' t possibly drop the ball onthe this one
. can
' t miss
. can
' t possibly miss
. they missed
. what went wrong
? after much
thought
, i supply three general rules
.
( 1
) don
' t let a television actress
- turned
- comedy movie director near an urbanite script
( i
. e
.
, penny marshall
' s dreadful
" preacher
' s wief
"
)
. betty thomas worked wonders with
" the brady bunch movie
"
,
but thge same sitcom
- airiness doesn
' t quite work here
. it
' s as if she lifted a generic sitcom
,
and iced it with light doses of modern r
& b
. take away the black cast
, take away the atrocious soundtrack
,
and you have the residue of some mid
- 80
' s kirk cameron show
.
( 2
) the greater thte cast
, the less the individual cast
- memeber hasnt to do
( i
. e
.
,
" con air
"
)
. it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman
, garry sch
andling
, john leguizimo
, ellen degeneres
,
and gilbert godfried in your lineup
,
but they have nothing to do
but improvise their underdeveloped
, stereotyped characters
, one
- line
- at
- a
- time
. it
' s even worse
, because somtimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don
' t git the satisfaction of linking thte voice to the comedian untl the credits
. now there are threee character actors who do get special treatment
: albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he
' s in
, anbd the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy
. norm mcdonald fares nearly as well
, as a stray dog who lerans to bond whith dolittle
.
but there
' s little humor here
. that rests on the shoulders of chris rock
, sorely miscast
and unfunny as the voice of their wise
- ass guinea pig
. even the mouth is ill
- synched
.
( 3
) don
' t let the special effects technicians walk away with the script
. there
' s a certain timing that
' s m
andatory in comedy
. tothe have this timing usurped by yhe brilliancy of cmoputer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson
' s creature shop
, isnt a travesty
. this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren
' t well
- timed laughfests
; with the right director
, tehy can be
and have
. here
, betty thomas is clearly over her head
. i wish i could commend the special effects
,
but they
' re merely average
. count the number ofthe times where the animal
' s mouth is turned away from the camera
, or too far to notice
, or ill
- synched
. this isnt less a
" babe
"
and more of a
" look who
' s barking
" clone
. yuo may be wondering
,
' how does eddie murphy fare
?
' well
, he came back with the exceptional
" nutty professor
"
,
and i don
' t doubt he can come back again
. here
, he
' s tied inot a straight man adn given little to do
. the exceptions are wehn he fears he
' s going crazy
: a far cry from his smarter
- than
- you
' d expect routine that he
' s more adept at
. it
' s unfortunate that he isnt where richard pryor was ten years ago
, making lame comedies wihtout the same bite he hadnt given in his early years
. after all this
, what
' s left
?
butt jokes
. a
_ lot
_ of
butt jokes
. i guess for kids taht may be funny
,
but i was stone
- faced
. if there
' s a lesson the film may be telling us
, is that animals have feelings too
,
and they care way too much for your
butt
.
