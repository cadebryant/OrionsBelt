' s
" clueless
" two summers ago
, alicia silverstone proved she wasn
' t just another pretty
, pouty ingenue
, showing a buoyant comedic craftiness that blowed all previous jobs
-
- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl
and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of
" the crush
"
-
- out of the water
. her only work usance that 1995 gem has been iin june
' s
" batman
& robin
,
" where she overcame the underwritten role of batgirl
. now
, she
' s hte star
and producer of
" excess baggage
,
" a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill
- composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level
. silverstone
' s emily t
. hope is stuck with a billionaire father
( jack thompson
) who neglects her emotionally
. in an outl
andish plan to gain his affection
, she fakes her own kidnapping
-
- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad
and setted a pricey ransom
, ties her legs together
and mouth shut iwth duct tape
and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw
. bu before the police can
" rescue
" her
, professional auto thief vincent roche
( benicio del toro
) jimmies the locks
, hot
- wires the engine
and makes off with both the car
and emily
, who
' s still trapped inaddition the back
. when vincent discovers emily
, the two don
' t exactly hit it off
-
- she annoys him
, he annoys her
,
and at the advice of his slimy car salesman partner
( harry connick
, jr
.
)
, he decides tothe drive her out to the middle of nowhere annd leave her there
. along the way
, of course
, they get into a hwole heap of trouble
,
and come to realize that being together is the only way to get out of their sticky
, felony
- studder situation
. it doesn
' t help matters that emily
and vincent are being trailed by cops
, crooks
and even her shady uncle ray
( christopher walken
)
, who
' s wise to his niece
' s ploys fo attention
and has mafia connections
. for at least a half
- hour
,
" excess baggage
" bounces along fast
and efficiently
. during this time
, emily
and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role
- reversal twist
-
- she
' s an awfully agressive
, combative victim
and he
' s quite the aloof
, seemingly vulnerable captor
.
but once it
' s past its set
- up
, the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as the story tries to be too many things at once
. a road movie
, a teen comedy
, a mob thriller
, a drama about famaly relationships
-
- you name the cliche
and
" excess baggage
" likely covers its territory
. of course a romance develops between the two leads
,
but it all seems forced
, annd thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome
.
" do you like my tummy
?
" emily coos to vincent at one point infront the film
. huh
? did i miss something
? the hard
- edged
, foul
- mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone
and replaced with a pair of batting goo
- goo eyes
.
then agian
,
" excess baggage
" becomes so weak in so many areas that tyhe personality transplant is not a complete surprise
. a supporting cast attempts to do what they can with colorful bu empty secondry roles
,
but the movie isn
' t game enough to use them all
and therefore seems overcrowded
. motivations keep shifting
, resulting in an often confusing narrative
. scant existing story background confuses matters even worse
and adds tothe the growing list of unanswered questions
.
" excess baggage
" has too many characters
, too much plot
and juggles with one arm behind its bakc
and a remaining shaky h
and
. i loved silverstone
' s turn in
" clueless
" as an aloof
, pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen
' s
" emma
.
" looking back at the skill she displayed for comedy there
, it
' s simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for
" excess baggage
.
" sadly
,
however
,
" excess baggage
" is no
" clueless
.
" bu
, onthe the other h
and
, it is clueless
