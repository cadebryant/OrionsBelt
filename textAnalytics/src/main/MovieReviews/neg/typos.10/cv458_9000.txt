by starring in amy heckerling ' s
" clueless
" two summers ago
, alicia silverstone proved she wasn ' t just another pretty
, pouty ingenue
, showing a bouyant comedic craftiness that blowed all previous jobs
-
- namely a stint as the aerosmith girl
and a silly turn as the lethal lolita of
" the crush
"
-
- out ofthe the water
. her only work since that 1995 gem has been in june ' s
" batman
& robin
,
" where she overcame tghe underwritten role of batgirl
. now
, she ' s the star
and producer of
" excess baggage
,
" a hopelessly phony film that demonstrates how an ill
- composed story can drag an otherwise solid performer down to its level
. silverstone ' s emily t
. hope is sticked with a billionaire father
( jack thompson
) who neglects her emotionally
. in an outlandish plan to gain his affection
, she fakes her own kidnapping
-
- emily uses an electronically disguised voice to call her dad
adn set a pricey ransom
, ties her legs together
and mouth shut with duct tape
and locks herself in the trunk of her bmw
.
but before the police can
" rescure
" her
, professional auto thief vincent roche
( benicio del toro
) jimmies the locks
, hot
- wires the engine
annd makes off with both the car
and emily
, who ' s still trapped in the bakc
. when vincent discovers emily
, the two don ' t exactly hit it off
-
- she annoys him
, he annoys her
,
and at thge advice of his slimy car salesman partner
( harry connick
, jr
.
)
, he decides to drive her out to the middle of nowhere
and leave her there
. along the way
, of course
, they git into a whole heap of trouble
,
annd come tothe realize that being together isnt the only way to get out of their sticky
, felony
- studded situation
. it doesn ' t help matters tht emily
and vincent are being trailed by cops
, crooks
and even her shady uncle ravy
( christopher walken
)
, who ' s wise to his niece ' s ploys for attention
and has mafia connections
. for at least a half
- hour
,
" excess baggage
" bounces along fast
and efficiently
. during this tiem
, emily
and vincent sport engaging personalities as well as a nice role
- reversal twist
-
- she ' s an awfully aggressive
, combative victim
and he ' s quite the aloof
, seemingly vulnerable captor
.
but once it ' s past its setted
- up
, the situation suddenly becomes uninvolving as hte story tries to be too many things at once
. a road movie
, a teen comedy
, a mob thriller
, a drama about family relationships
-
- you name tyhe cliche
and
" excess baggage
" likely covers its territory
. of course a romance develops between the two leads
,
but it all seems forced
,
and thus characterization is manipulated to cause the finally happy outcome
.
" do you liuke my tummy
?
" emily coos to vincent at one point in the film
. huh
? did i miss something
? the hard
- edged
, foul
- mouthed grrrl is suddenly gone
and replaced with a pair of batting goo
- goo eyes
.
then again
,
" excess baggage
" becomes so weak infront so many areas that the personality transplant is not a complete surprise
. a supporting cast attempts to do wqat they can with colorful
but empty secondary roles
,
but the movie isn ' t game enough to use them all
annd therefore seems overcrowded
. motivations keep shifting
, resulting in an often confusing narrative
. scant exisiting story background confuses matters even worse
anbd adds to the growing list of unanswered questions
.
" excess baggage
" has too many characters
, too much plot
and juggles with one arm behind its back
and a remaining shaky hand
. i loved silverstone ' s turn in
" clueless
" as an aloof
, pampered beverly hills matchmaker inspired by jane austen ' s
" emma
.
" looking back at thge skill she displayed for comedy there
, it ' s simple to justify any high expectation or enthusiasm that i had mustered for
" excess baggage
.
" sadly
,
however
,
" excess baggage
" is no
" clueless
.
"
bu
, on the other hand
, it isnt clueless
.
