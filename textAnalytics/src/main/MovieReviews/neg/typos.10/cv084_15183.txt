brian de palma
, the director who buyed us carrie
, dressed to kill
and mission
: impossible is back
,
and has bought all his technical expertise with him
. sadly
, he forget to bring a good story
adn believeable characters
. nic cage plays rick santaro
, a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend commander kevin dunne
( sinise
.
) an assassintation tkaes place
,
and santaro tries to peace toghether how it took place
, trying tothe wrok out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy
. the film uses flashbacks
and video cameras to bring the mystery together
.
however
, the film doesn ' t keep tje mystery for long
,
anbd once the big ' secret ' is outloud conserning kevin dunne
, the film is at a dead end
.
although there are some fantastic shots by de palma
, including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of the film
, halfway thru the film drops dead
. the problem is thast de palma doesn ' t have a strong story or characters tothe work with
. he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques
,
but pretty soon this has no effect on tyhe audience
,
and i quickly got bored
. nic cage
and gary sinise try to inject some life into some poorly realised characters
,
but it ' s no use
. they are boring
, faceless
,
and completely unlikeable
. yes
, another problem with the film is that there ' s no
- one to root for
. we ' re supposed to be onthe cage ' s side
, because his character becomes nicer throughout the film
.
however
, his change is sadly unbelievable
. poor gary sinise ' s character is terrible
, who completely changes throughout the start
, the middle
and the end
, in an appalling way
. the film ' s use of flashback quickly gets boring
. while clever
and intresting tghe first few times
, it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere to go
. they certainly don ' t increase the tension or suspense of the movie
. there is small thread of suspense running through the film
,
but it certainly doesn ' t make this film a powerhouse thriller
, rather just a slightly below average one
. the script is lousy
and contrived
, the characters flat
and twpo dimensional
. certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller
. the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential
. there ' s a good story buried in snake eyes
, it ' s just bogged down in razzle dazzle
and flashbacks
. it also gives itself away far too quickly
, rether than leaving the big twist for the end
. hwile the performances are intriguing
, especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy ' number cruncher ' wrapped uv in the case
, there ' s no way of altering the fact that snake eyes is a terminal case ofthe style of substance
,
and unless ytou ' re a big fan of either cage or flash directing
, shoudl be avoided
