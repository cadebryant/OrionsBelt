brian de palma
, tyhe director who bought us carrie
, dressed to kill
and mission
: impossible is back
,
and has bought all his technical expertise with him
. sadly
, he forget to bring a ogod story
and believable charachters
. nic cage plays rick santaro
, a fast talking cop who is watching a boxing match with his friend comm
ander kevin dunne
( sinise
.
) an assassination takes place
,
and santaro tries tothe peace together how it took place
, trying tothe work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy
. yhe film uses flashbacks
and video cameras to bring teh mystery together
.
however
, the film doesn
' t keep the mystery for long
,
and once the big
' secrte
' is out concerning kevin dunne
, the film is at a dead end
.
al
though there are some fantastic shots by de palma
, including a 15 minute steadicam shot at the start of yhe film
, halfway through the film drops dead
. the problem is that de palma doesn
' t have a storng story or characters to work with
. he tries to offshoot this with flashy camera techniques
,
but pretty soon tihs has no effect on the audience
,
and i quickly got bored
. nic cage
and gary sinise try tothe inject some life into some poorly realised characters
,
but it
' s no use
. they are boring
, faceless
,
and completely unlikeable
. yes
, anohter problem with the film is that there
' s no
- one tothe root for
. we
' re supposed tothe be on cage
' s side
, because his character becomes nicer throughout the film
.
however
, his change is sadly unbelievable
. poor gary sinise
' s character is terrible
, who completely changes throughout the start
, the middle
and the end
, in an appalling way
. the film
' s use of flashback quicklyu gets boring
. hwile clever
and interesting the first few times
, it quickly becomes apparent that flashbacks are being used because the film has nowhere tothe go
. they certainly don
' t increase the tension or suspense of the movie
. there is small thread ofthe suspense running through the film
,
but it certainly doesn
' t make this film a powerhouse thriller
, rather just a slightly below average one
. the script is lousy
and contrived
, the characters flat
and two dimentional
. certainly not good factors for a film passing itself off for a thriller
. the most depressing aspect of the film is that it had potential
. ther
' s a good story buried in snake eyes
, it
' s jsut bogged down in razzle dazzle
and flashbacks
. it also gives itself awya far too quickly
, rather than leaving the big twist for the end
. while the performances are intriguing
, especially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy
' number cruncher
' wrapped up in the case
, there
' s noone way of altering the fatc that snake eyes isnt a terminal case ofthe style of substance
,
and unless you
' re a big fan ofthe either cage or flash directing
, should be avoided
