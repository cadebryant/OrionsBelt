over 40 years ago
, a japanese production company called toho introduced the land ofthe the rising sun to gojira
, a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind ' s nuclear testing
. partly flight of fancy
, partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power
and weaponry
, gojira emerged fomr the ocean tothe terrorize tokyo
. a year later
, gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things
: a new nmae
, a dubbed english track
,
and raymond burr
. as godzilla
, yhe film took on the rest of the world
. thirty years later
, toho remade the clasic film
and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things
( yes
, including raymond burr
)
and called it godzilla 1985
. now it ' s 14 years after toho ' s remake
,
and director roland emmerich has allowed tyhe giant lizard to mkea an american first run
. in emmerich ' s godzilla
, matthew broderick plays dr
. niko tatopoulos
, a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in teh south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation
- induced super mutant which leaves footprints tje size of livingrooms
. wehn the mutant reptile suddenly appears outloud ofthe the hudson river
, tatopoulos
and the rest of teh team relocate themselves back to the states
. meanwhile
, tatopoulos ' s coleeg girlfriend
, audrey timmonds
( maria pitillo
)
, works in new york city as an assistant to a big
- time news reporter
. she ' d like to be a reporter herself
,
and when godzilla comes ashore
, she figures this is her big break
. of course
, with the big guy running amok inspite the city
, niko
and audrey are bound to cross paths
,
and are joined by victor
" animal
" palotti
( hank azaria
)
, audrey ' s trusty cameraman friend
,
and phillipe roche
( jean reno
)
, an operative for the french governmnet
, whose nucular testing started the whole problem in the first place
. together they attempt to find
and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla
. with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses
and the clout of one of the nation ' s premiere movie production companies
, oen would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla
. he didn ' t
. right up there with the lost world
, godzilla is one ofthe the biggest disappointments inwhich recent cinematic history
. the plot is pretty much what we expect
: the big dinosaur
- like creature comes out ofthe the water
and starts smashing new york city
,
and it ' s up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage
and how it can be stopped
, while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down
. yhe script
,
however
, is painfully bad
. it ' s fraught with lines so corny
, they don ' t even belong in b
- movies
,
and includes many character actions which make you think
,
" you idiot
,
" or
" you stupid girl
.
" i suppose when you ' ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose infact new york
, any otehr semblance of reality goes outloud hte window as well
. why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them
,
but is conveniently able to leap atop others
? why dont helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sighth of him
, when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher
and infact a straight line
? why do sidewinder missiles
, which have small explosive warheads
, blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla
? why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f
- 18 fighter
- bombers
, when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two
? okay
, maybe the last one was a bit nit
- picky
,
but hey
, i was on a roll
. broderick is usually a good actor
,
but in this film he ' s weighed down by an unexciting character
and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way
. hank azaria doesnt what he can
,
bu don ' t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage
. like broderick ' s
, azaria ' s character is quite simply lacking in color
. what really anoyed me was maria pitillo
, who actually takes the bad script
and mkaes it worse with her acting
. casting must ahve been asleep on this one
. the one bright spot here is jean reno
, who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which isnt often comedic
, quite unlike what we ' ve seem him do in the past
.
although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster
, reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable
. unfortunately
, the same cannot be said of the other incongruities
. the entire feel of the movie is tongue
- in
- cheek
,
and seems tothe pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it
. this results inspite a significant amount of parody
, which contrasts sharply with thge threat of the monster
,
anbd ends up just producing a mess
. most of the characters seem to be there for comic releaf
,
and almost none are smart enought for the audiance to take seriously
. altho emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture
, what good isnt it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens
? if we cant ' t take the characters seriously
, the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don ' t care what happens to them
. godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attemp to be a film more light
- hearted than it should be
. far be it from me to want to see mroe carnage in the theaters
,
but here ' s a behemoth runing through the city
! there ' s binded to be a lot of casualties
,
but instead godzilla isnt afflicted with the after
- school g
. i
. joe cartoon syndrome
, where almost everyone seems to get out of harm ' s way just in time
. inthe a couple of scenes
, godzilla briefly breathes fire
. none of the characters even remark upon thsi ability
, nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers
. it ' s as if the special effects people just wanted to sohw that yes
, godzilla can do this
, just like in the old movie
. consider another punch pulled
. through creative script writing
, you can make a sequel out of just about any movie
,
but the final scene in this one doesn ' t just leave the door open
, it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently
. it made me want to gag
. emmerich should hve done away with 90
% of the humor
anbd in
- jokes
and played this one as a straight action film
. with an intelligently written screenplay
, godzilla could have been so much more
.
however
, by confusing yhe viewer with a ton of add
- ins
and parodies
, hte movie ends up being something that just doesn ' t work
. now if they only had raymond burr
.
.
.
