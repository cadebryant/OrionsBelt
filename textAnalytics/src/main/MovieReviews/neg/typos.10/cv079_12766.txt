over 40 eyasr ago
, a japanese production company called toho introduced the l
and of the rising sun tothe gojira
, a reptilian creature ofthe immense proportions created by mankind
' s nuclear testing
. partly flight of fancy
, partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power
and weaponry
, gojira emerged from thge ocean to terrorize tokyo
. a year later
, gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things
: a new name
, a dubbed english track
,
and raymond burr
. as godzilla
, the film took on the rest ofthe the world
. thirty years later
, toho remade the classic film
and once again took it to thge american market by adding the same three things
( yes
, including raymond burr
)
and called it godzilla 1985
. now it
' s 14 years after toho
' s remake
,
and director rol
and emmerich has allowed hte giant lizard to amking an american first run
. in emmerich
' s godzilla
, matthew broderick plays dr
. niko tatopoulos
, a biologist who is called in tothe join other scientists in tyhe south pacific already studing the existence of a radiation
- induced super mutant hwihc leaves footprints the size ofthe livingrooms
. when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river
, tatopoulos
and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states
. meanwhile
, tatopoulos
' s college girlfriend
, audrey timmonds
( maria pitillo
)
, works in new york city as an assistant to a big
- time news repertwar
. she
' d like to be a reporter herself
,
and when godzilla comes ashore
, she figures this is her big break
. of course
, with the big guy running amok in the city
, niko
and audrey are bound to cross paths
,
and are joined by victor
" animal
" palotti
( hank azaria
)
, audrey
' s trusty cameraman friend
,
and phillipe roche
( jean reno
)
, an operative for the french government
, whose nucular testing started the whole probelm in the first place
. together they attempt to fidn
and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla
. with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses
and the clout of oen of the nation
' s premiere movie prodcution companies
, one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving ofthe the name godzilla
. he didn
' t
. right up there with the lost world
, godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history
. the plot is pretty much what we expect
: the big dinosaur
- like creature comes out of the water
and starts smashing new york city
,
and it
' s up to our heroes tothe figure out why htis thing is onthe its rampage
and how it can be stopped
, while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down
. the script
,
however
, is painfully bad
. it
' s fraught with lines so corny
, htey don
' t even belong in b
- movies
, anbd includes many character actions which make you think
,
" you idiat
,
" or
" you stupid girl
.
" i supose when ytou
' ve got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york
, any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well
. why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them
,
but is conveniently able to leap atop others
? why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him
, when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higer
and in a straight line
? why do sidewinder missiles
, which have small explosive warheads
, blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla
? why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f
- 18 fighter
- bombers
, when flights ofthe such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of twpo
? okay
, maybe the last one was a bit nit
- picky
,
but hey
, i was onthe a roll
. broderick is usually a ogod actor
,
but in this film he
' s weighed down by an unexciting character
and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way
. hank azaria does what he can
,
but don
' t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed inaddition the birdcage
. like broderick
' s
, azaria
' s character is quite simply lacking in color
. what really annoyed me was maria pitillo
, who actually takes the bad script
and makes it worse with her acting
. casting must have been asleep on this one
. yhe noe bright spot here is jean reno
, who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role hwihc is often comedic
, quite unlike whta we
' ve seem him dont in the past
.
al
though his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster
, reno brings a style to tje role of phillipe which makse him enjoyable
. unfourtunately
, the same cannot be said of the other incongruities
. the entire feel of the movie is tongue
- in
- cheek
,
and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that ahve come before it
. this results in a significant amount of parody
, whitch contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster
, annd ends up just producing a mess
. most of the characters seem to be there for comic releaf
,
and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously
.
al
though emmerich obviously wanted to mkea a fun action picture
, what good is it to sink millions inot a cgi creature whose ferocity isnt undermined by the humans he threatens
? if we cxan
' t tkae the characters seriously
, the threat they face is an empty one becasue we simply don
' t care what happens to them
. godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film moreso light
- hearted than it shoudln be
. far be it fomr me to want to see more carnage in the theaters
,
but here
' s a behemoth running through the city
! there
' s bound to be a lot of casualties
,
but instead godzilla is afflicted iwth the after
- school g
. i
. joe cartoon syndrome
, where almost everyone seems to get outloud of harm
' s way just in time
. in a cuple of scenes
, godzilla briefly breathes fire
. none of the characters even remark upon this ability
, nor is it used to any particular advantage by tjhe filmmakers
. it
' s as if the special effects people just wanted to show tht yes
, godzilla can do thsi
, just like in the old movie
. consider anohter punch pulled
. through creative script writing
, you can make a sequel out of just about any movie
, bu the final scene in this one doesn
' t just leave the door open
, it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently
. it made me want to gag
. emmerich shoudln have done away with 90
% of the humor
and in
- jokes
and played tihs one as a straight action film
. with an intelligently written screenplay
, godzilla could have been so much more
.
however
, by confusing the viewer withthe a ton of add
- ins
and parodies
, the movie ends up being something that just doesn
' t work
. now if they only had raymond burr
.
.
