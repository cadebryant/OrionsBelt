woudl ytou believe
-
- in real life
, i mean
-
- tath if you were julia roberts
, that you
' d be the ugly underdog to your sister
, the creepy catherine zeta
- jones
? let me tell you whta reality is
. reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts
and your brother is eric roberts
, anbd he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot
. that
' s reality
. america
' s sweethearts is the opposite of reality
, a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also
- ran
, presumabely because she wears horn
- rimmed glasses
and used to be overweight
( uh
- huh
)
. tyhe plot follows two married
, mega
- movie stars
, gwen
and eddie
( zeta
- jones
and poor
, poor john cusack
, whose material gets worse every year
)
, on tjhe eve of their new star vehicle
' s release
, a film called time over time
. the only problem
: gwen
and eddie ahve gone through a nasty separation
,
and the press
and public have not been forgiving
( htikn meg
and dennis
)
. gosh
,
and the director has vanished with the film
, holding tghe only print hostage
. vetran pr agent lee
( billy crystal
) is called upon to clean up the mess
, throwing a press junket iin the nevada desert to woo them with thte story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen
and eddie
, presumably distracting tghe stupid
, stupid film critics into forgetting they haven
' t seen thte movie at all
.
( onot tothe sony
: any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with tyhe reviewing press needs to check inot rehab
.
)
and did i mention gwen
' s sister kiki
( roberts
) is along for the ride
?
and that she
and eddie just might fall in love along the way
? oh billy
, you
' re a scamp
! the scirpt you
' ve co
- written with peter tolan
( what planet are you from
?
and bedazzled
-
- need i say more
?
) is a roast of hollywood
and celebrity
, sure
,
but it
' s not a funny one
. yes
, crystal tells us
, hollywood is lieing tothe our faces
! if ytou are surprised by this
, you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine
. it
' s about to expire
. aside from a scant few zingers
( yeah
, se
? or winces rules
!
)
, america
' s sweethearts
' jokes aren
' t funny
, its pace is choppy
,
and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project
-
- not for headlining star julia roberts
-
-
but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself
. i didn
' t time it
( tghe movie
' s not taht bad
)
,
but it
' s crystal who really has the most screen time
and is the unequivocal focus of the film
. bad move
, billy
-
- your jokes suck
. the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of thge movei
' s gags
-
-
and with unsubtle sexual inuendo dripping from every scene
, how this movie earned a pg
- 13 rating isnt a mystery to me
. julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing
and acting to make my best friend
' s wedding into a winning film
,
but not even that 90
- tooth smile can save her here
. obviously aware ofthe the ugliness before him
, director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria
( as a lisping spaniard
)
, christopher walken
( the insane time over time director
)
, anbd alan arkin
( a new age guru infront a fright wig
) to crack wise
. none of the stereotypes is successful exept for walken
; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he
' s supposed to be macho
. as for roth
, in case you don
' t know
, went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio
, revolution
, which produced this work
. he
' s back behind the camera fo the first time in 11 yeasr
. it
' ll probably be another 11 befoer he
' s back again
. i could drone on about how america
' s sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth
- breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies
,
but that would get old
. instead
, i
' ll settle for discussing the movie
' s worst sin
: that sweethearts is painfully contrived
and wholly unbelievable
, not just in its plot
but in its sentiment
. every single character in this film
( with the arguable exception of kiki
) is simply hateful
,
and putting them in a rumatic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains
. wehn you leave the theater
, you
' ll ask yourself
, too
: why would i want any of these jerks to be happy
?
