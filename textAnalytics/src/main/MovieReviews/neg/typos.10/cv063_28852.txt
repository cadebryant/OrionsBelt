would you believe
-
- in real life
, i mean
-
- that if you were julia roberts
, that you ' d be the ugly underdog to your sister
, tjhe creepy catherine zeta
- jones
? let me tell you what reality isnt
. reality is thta ytou are megastar julia fricking roberts
and your brother isnt eric roberts
,
and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot
. that ' s reality
. america ' s sweethearts is the opposite of reality
, a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also
- ran
, presumably because she wears horn
- rimmed glasses
and used to be overweight
( uh
- huh
)
. tjhe plot follows two married
, mega
- movie stars
, gwen
and eddie
( zeta
- jones
and poor
, poor john cusack
, whose material gets worse every year
)
, on the eve of their new star vehicule ' s release
, a film called time over time
. the only problem
: gwen
and eddie have gone through a nasty separation
,
and the press
and public have not been forgiving
( think meg
and dennis
)
. gosh
,
and the director has vanished with the film
, holding tghe only print hostage
. veteran pr agent lee
( billy crystal
) is called upon tothe clean up the mess
, throwing a press junkte in the nevada desert tothe woo them wiht the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen
annd eddie
, presumably distracting the stupid
, stupid film criticists into forgetting they haven ' t seen the movie at all
.
( note tothe sony
: any studio executive that thinks thsi plot is going to win points with teh reviewing press needs tothe check inot rehab
.
)
and did i mention gwen ' s sister kiki
( roberts
) is along for the ride
?
and that she
and eddie just might fall in love along the way
? oh billy
, you ' re a scamp
! the script you ' ve co
- written whith peter tolan
( what planet are you from
?
and bedazzled
-
- need i sday mroe
?
) is a roast of hollywood
and celebrity
, sure
,
but it ' s not a funny one
. yes
, crystal tells us
, hollywood is lying to our faces
! if yuo are surprised by this
, you might want to check on your subscription to peopel magazine
. it ' s about to expire
. asside from a scant few zingers
( yeah
, se
? or winces rules
!
)
, america ' s sweethearts ' jokes aren ' t funny
, its pace is choppy
,
and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project
-
- not for headlining star julia roberts
-
-
but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself
. i didn ' t time it
( the movie ' s nto that bad
)
,
but it ' s crystal who really has the most screen time
and is the unequivocal focus ofthe the film
. bad move
, billy
-
- your jokes suck
. the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie ' s gags
-
-
anbd with unsubtle sexual inuendo dripping ffrom every scene
, how this movie earned a pg
- 13 rating is a mystery to me
. julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing
and acting to make my best friend ' s wedding into a winning film
,
but not even that 90
- tooth smile can save her here
. obviously aware of the ugliness before him
, director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria
( as a lisping spaniard
)
, christopher walken
( thte insane time over time director
)
,
and alan arkin
( a new age guru in a fright wig
) to crack wise
. none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken
; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he ' s supposed to be macho
. as for roth
, inwhich case you don ' t know
, went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio
, revolution
, which produced this work
. he ' s back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years
. it ' ll probably be another 11 before he ' s back again
. i could drone on about how america ' s sweethearts will onyl appeal to the mouth
- breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies
,
but that would get old
. instead
, i ' ll settle for discussing the movie ' s worst sin
: that sweethearts isnt painfully contrived
annd wholly unbelievable
, not just in its plot
but in its sentiment
. eveyr single character in this film
( with the arguable exception of kiki
) is simply hateful
,
and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains
. when you leave the theater
, you ' ll ask yourself
, too
: why would i want any of these jerks to be happy
?
