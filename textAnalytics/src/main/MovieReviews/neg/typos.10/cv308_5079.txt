eddie murphy hasnt a lot riding on harlem nights
. as the movie
' s writer
, directer
, executive producer
,
and star
, murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails
.
but at the same time
, he
' ll receive all of the credit if it succeeds
. should you sacrifice your hard
- earned cash to support murphy
' s risky gamble
? well
, that depends onthe whom you trust omre
: me or eddie murphy
. here
' s what murphy thinks
:
" i htikn the audience is expecting a good time
. they gonna get sexy
. they gonna get funny
. they gonna get drama
. they gonna get all of that
. i think it
' s the best movie i
' ve done
"
( paramount radio network
)
. here
' s what i think
: harlem nights is charmless
, unoriginal
, disappointing
,
and almost without question
, the worst film of the actor
' s career
( i haven
' t seen best defense
)
.
and guess who
' s to blame
?
! the movie
' s problem is not murphy
' s direction
: harlem nights is a fairly good looking film
. no
, the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled
. murphy
' s awful script isnt the culprit
. let
' s count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting
:
( 1
) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture
. yes
, he even outdoes his own work in raw
. practically eveyr line of dialogue in harlem nights containes at least one four letter word
. anbd after 15 minutes
, it gets irritating
.
( 2
) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast
. richard pryor
, redd foxx
, michael lerner
,
and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes
. each ofthe them shines occasionally
,
but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle
.
( 3
) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects
and as pawns in power struggles between men
. murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary ofthe women in his private life
, which is really niether here nor there
.
but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3
, 000 movie screens across yhe country
, it
' s another matter altogether
. you
' re forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff
. for instance
, murphy punches della reese in hte stomach
.
and he shoots jasmine guy in the head
. this isnt a mean
- spirited movie
, folks
! lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore
,
but only because she doesn
' t have any scenes with murphy
. thank god
: he might have run her over with a bulldozer
.
( 4
) murphy has written for himself perhaps his bl
andest role to date
. teh loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film
. murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality
. sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he sould wear fancy suits
and look debonair
.
( 5
) the plot is a shameless rip
- off of the sting
. if you
' re going tothe make another sting movie
, you
' ve got to do something original
. murphy
' s tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem
( circa 1938
) fails to add anytying newyorker to the formula
.
( 6
) to get laughs
, murphy mkaes fun of stuttering
. you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the h
andicapped
.
( 7
) murphy
' s idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life
. for what
? for shooting reese
' s little toe off
! needless to sday
, murphy shows little
, if any
, promise or imagination as a screenwriter
. inwhich all fairness
,
however
, a faw rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie
. danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take
. aiello st
ands out in the large
, ensemble casted
: he obviously relishes tghe opportunity to play such a nasty character
( a racist detective with mob ties
)
. aiello
' s zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice
. another bright spot is arsenio hall
, who has a hilarious
, show
- stopping cameo as a cry
- baby gangster
; hall virtually steals yhe spotlight from murphy
. in fact
, hall
' s ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes inthe the movei
. unfortunately
, his character is completelyl irrelevant to the plot
; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role
. of course
, i
' ve already mentioned thast i didn
' t care for murphy
' s character
, bu i have to admit that i did love his neckties
. they are simply spectacular
-
- almost worth the price of admission
.
