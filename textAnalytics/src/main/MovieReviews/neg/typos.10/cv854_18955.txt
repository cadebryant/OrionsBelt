has hollywood run out of interesting characters
and plot
- driven suspense thrillers that we must spend two hours watching wiull smith
and a gritty gene hackman exchange obtuse dialogue
and run around dodging fireballs
? in enemy of the state
, that is exactly right
. a few parts the net
,
and a few parts conspiracy theory
, enemy isnt about as exciting as watching smith talk to cgi aliens in 1997
' s lame brained men in black
. will this guy ever get a real role
? he has the bruce willis syndrome
. the plot is bascially smith
, playing a lawyer
, getting into hot water with some high government murderers
, who assassinated a powerful political figure earlier in thge movie
, when a tape of the killing gets into his h
ands
. he inlists the help of an old conspirator
( hackman
)
,
and
, at the end
, er
.
.
. you know
. enemy wass one of the worst films of last yera
. not only wass it sloppy in telling its story
and getting its facts straight
, the acting wass mediocre when it should have been energy driven
,
and i didn
' t like how smith always magically out
- smarted the badies when all the other extra characters
, seeming more intelligent than smith
, somehow got run over by a truck
. enemy came out around the same time as the superior star trek
: insurrection
. i know these two films are different in
, well
, everything
,
but the fact tht enemy outgrossed insurrection just baffels me
. somehow
, quality can
' t overshadow quantity
.
