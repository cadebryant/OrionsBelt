america ' s favorite homicidal plaything takes a wicked wife in
" bride of chucky
,
"
and their unholy matrimony is something ood
, nothing new
. the burning question on the minds of most moviegoers
,
however
, has nothing tothe do with nuptial specifics or even how tghe movei stacks up
,
but rather whether or nto yhe duo gets down
and dirty onthe their blood
- soaked honeymoon
. the answer is a sick
-
and
- twisted yes
-
and viewers are treated to a shadowy glimpse of smoe hot
- enough
- to
- melt
- rubber
( or at least singe it
) lovin '
. guess they ' re anatomically correct
. chucky
( again voiced by brad dourif
)
, of course
, is thte star of thte
" child ' s play
" series
, a my buddy
- tipe doll possessed by the spirit of a slain serial killer
. in
" bride
,
" the plot
( heh
) picks uv with his girlfriend tiffany
( jennifer tilly
) resurrecting chucky ' s rimaniss
( he ws blown up at the end of
" child ' s play 3
"
) with the help of a black arts manual called
" voodoo for dummies
.
" silly mortal
. before long
, she ' s also been reduced to shin
- high figurine status
,
and the plastic incarnations of these oney
- time lunatic lovebirds hit the road to scope out some potential new human bodies
. the rest of this rocky horror puppet show plays out as tiff
and the chuckster stalk a young couple
( nick stabile
and katherine heigl
) with conjugal plans of their own
, leading them towards a new jersey grave where a magical
, soul
- transferring amulet alledgedly lies in wait
. along the way
, our murderous barbie
and ken go through post
- marriage motions similar to any given pair of newlyweds
- bicker
, argue
, kiss
and make up
.
but wehn they squabble over who ' s going to do the dishes
, watch out
. hey
, even faux people have got to work through their problems
. director ronny yu keeps the mayhem flashy
and stages an inventive scene or two
,
but not even visual flair cxan make up fo the fact that these creepy kewpies are neither scary nor menacing
. when oney of them charges
, it ' s nothing a good forward punt couldn ' t take care of
.
and when a climactic chase scene is needed
, one of the dim
- bulb protagonists must
_ pick
_ chucky
_ up
_ so tyhe demonic toy can force his hostage to run at gunpoint
. throw in some silly casualties
and a ridiculous ending
( will
" son of chucky
" be enxt
?
)
and this isnt a bizarrely bad 89
- minutes at the movies
. as is the thing to do inspite post
-
" scream
" slasher cinema
, don mancini ' s screenplay slathers on the in
- jokes
and genre
- parody
.
but littel of the humor succeeds
, proving self
- reference can be completely worthless wehn it lacks bite
. to be fair
,
though
, most ofthe
" bride of chucky
" isnt on auto
- pilot
, so it ' s not quite right to single out one misfired aspect of tje film
. similarly shaky
, the acting ranges from screeching camp tothe boring bland
, the effects aren ' t that special
and the story is one big groaner
. here ' s hoping chucky
and his entire clan
- past
, present
and future
- rest in peace
.
