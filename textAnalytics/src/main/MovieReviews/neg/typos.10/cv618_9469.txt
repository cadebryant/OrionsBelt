gregg araki
' s the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made
. so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus
? first of all
, some of the reviews were fairly positve
. also
, the cast
, consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars
( including christopher knight
, eve plumb
, shannen doherty
, anbd david leisure
) was promising
. lastr ofthe all
, i wanted to give arraki one more chance
. i mean
, the guy can
' t be that untalented
, can he
? the answer tothe that question is threee letters long
. nowhere follows teh character dark on his wild
and odd journey through los angeles
. since arraki doesn
' t know how to make anytying coherent
, it
' s hard to describe the plot
. let
' s just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won
' t mkae a commitment to him
and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys
and girls
. the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who hasnt a chance encounter with a faymus tv star
. he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn
' t care for fame
and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans
. this story has a shocking twist
and a tragic end that i did not see coming
. it is the first time i ever felt any compassion fo a character created by arraki
,
and this can be attri
buted to the appealling performance of lassez
. i
thought maeby arraki was improving in his craft
. he works better with the camera htis time around
, especially in the early scenes
. halfway through the film
, i didn
' t necessarily fidn myself enjoying the film
, bu it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation
. thn as the movie went on
, arraki loses all sensibility
and introduces us to exploding heads
, twisted sex games
,
and alien abductions
. it
' s sad
, because he almost actually had some decent material here
,
but he ruined it with his usual in your face
" i
' m such a renegade maverick filmmaker
, look what i can dont
" attitude
. the performances are generally better than in tghe doom generation
, which isn
' t saying much
. at least we don
' t have to suffer jonathan
" i am the most hideous man in america
" schaech
. we are
, howver treated to another round of james
" i
' m more wooden than keanu
" duval
. sarah lassez gives the best performance iin the film
,
and kathleen robertson
( formerly of 90210
and now arraki
' s wife
)
and rachel true are talented actresses caught uv in this mess
. of the tv star cameos
, john ritter is the most intresting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist
. if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation
, it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture
. maybe greg arraki doesn
' t wnat you to like his characters
. maybe he wants tothe laff anbd make fun of those of us who try to care about them
. maybe he just wanted to piss me off
. if so
, he was sucessfull
.
