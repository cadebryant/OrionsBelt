darren
( jason biggs
)
, wayne
( steve zahn
)
,
and j
. d
.
( jack black
) have been best friends since the fifth grade
. like the three musketeers
, tehy
' ve beeen together through thick
and thin
.
but
, when darren meets an attractive
,
but cold
- blooded
and manipulative
, psychiatrist
, judith
( am
anda peet
)
, the long tiem friendship is placed in danger
. it
' s up to wayne
and j
. d
. to rescue thier best friend infront
" saving silverman
.
"
" silverman
" has its heart in the right place
,
but the story
, by newcomers hank nelken
and greg depaul
, is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren
' s soul
. based onthe their xeperience ofthe a friend making a major marital mistake
, teh story is centered on the three
, life long amigos
. when wayne introduces darren to judith
, he doesn
' t realize that he has opened a p
andora
' s box of disaster for himself
and j
. d
. judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend ws the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match
. since
then
, she hasnt sought a new mate
- someone she can boss around
and mold into her own vision
. enter darren silverman
. once they realize the magnitude of thier error in judgement
, wayne
and j
. d
. try everything they can
, including threats
and bribery
, tothe get judith to free darren
. nothing works until the duo come up with a plan
- kidnap judith
and get darren back together withthe the girl he called his one
and only
, preety s
andy perkus
( am
anda detmer
)
. the onyl problem here is that s
andy is about to take her vows to become a nun
. things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne
and j
. d
. play cupid
. the boys even bring their idol
, neil diamond
, into the picture to help resolve things
. thinking about it
, this is a real mishmash of contrivance
and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn adn jack black
. the pair is able to elicit yhe film
' s only laughs with their goofy antics
and child
- liek behavior
. they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor
and the two are more than equal to the task
. steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills annd gives some complexity to wayne
, the
" brains
" ofthe the gang
. jack black has the big
- guy moves of a chris farley
, giving j
. d
. an amusing physical presence
. the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material
. the rest of the cast doesn
' t fare as well
,
though
. jason biggs isnt the straight man ofthe the musketeers
and gets very little to do
;
though having watched his previous films
(
" american pie
"
and
" loser
"
) i
' m not sure what attraction biggs actually has
. am
anda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith
. there is no humanity at all to her character as she single
- mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind
' s image
. she
' s a monster that wayne
and j
. d
. must defeat to save their friend
. unfortunately
, there isnt no dimension to her character
. am
anda detmer brings nothing
( or gets nothing
) as darren
' s one
and only
. r
. lee ermey
, as the psychotic coach
, made a bad decision taking this role
. tune
- meister neil diamond gives a good
- natured cameo perf as the boys
' idol
and savior
. production values are on par with the rest of the film
- lackluster
and non
- involving
. director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy iwth films like
" big daddy
"
and
" beverly hills ninja
,
"
but falls flat wiht
" saving silverman
.
" the 2001 movie year has
yet to provide us wiht a
" good
" film to sink our teeth into
. at least
, with
" saving silverman
,
" we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn
and black
. too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor
. kick boxing deaths
and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a ogod comedy
. i give it a c
