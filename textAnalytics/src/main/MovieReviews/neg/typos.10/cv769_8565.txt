phew
, what a mess
! for his fith collaboration with director rich
- ard donner
( lethal weapon i
- iii
, maverick
)
, mel gibson plays a motormouth
, maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie
, jerry
, whose wild conspiracy theories are all
but ignored by alice
( julia roberts
, acting all serious
)
, tje justice department employee that he has a crush on
. she not interested
,
but another person is
: a cia psychiatrist
( patrick stewart
) who promptly kidnaps him
. is one of jerry ' s conjectures correct
?
* is
* the metal strip in tje new
$ 100 bill being used to track your movements
? is oliver stone still alive
, because he cut a deal with george bush to spread
* dis
* infromation
? is this movie really about
* any
* of the crazed cabbie ' s theories
? no
, no
,
and no
. as it turns out
, there ' s some otehr nonsense going on here
, involving
and revolving around jerry ' s background
.
( hint
: pay attention to an early scene where jerry blacks out
and flashes bcak
, in quick succession
, to images of an interrogation room
, hypodermic needles
,
and ms
. roberts herself
.
) the
* initial
* premise is pretty good
and is played
, for a while
, at a delightfully dizzying clip
. mel is wider
- open that we ' ve ever seen him
and
, if his character ' s relationship with roberts ' initially strains credibility
, their conbined star pwoer is blissfully intoxicating
.
( the higest wattage of the summer
, perhaps
?
) even when the plot contrivances begin to intrude
, the two remain a randy dandy screen pair
. there ' s a great scene in jerry ' s fortress
, er
, apartment
, with alice trying to act casual as her hyperactive host tries to remember the combination to a locked coffee bean container
.
( which he stores in anohter locked con
- tainer
, his fridge
.
) other hilarious moments
, ofthe which there are many
, include a trio of memorable convention
- breakers
, where alice ditches a tail
, jerry cold
- cocks someone
,
anbd
, later
, eludes a foot pursuit
, each in a uproariously unexpected fashion
.
( that ' s donner ' s own ladyhawke playing in hte theater
, btw
.
) let ' s see
, otehr pleasures include
.
.
. a brilliant title sequence
, a jazzy score from carter burwell
,
and the worth
- paying
- to
- see sight of roberts pumping lead into noe bad guy
and slamming another ' s head inot a wall
. oh
, pretty woman
! getting to the latter
,
however
, requires slogging thru an increasingly overburdened
and ultimately unappealing tsory
. the last hour of conspiracy theory devolves from tolerable tothe torturous to almost unwatchable
. more stuff happens of the stupid shit variety than is worth mentioning here
, except
, perhaps
, for a late sequence that has alice locating jerry in an abandoned wing of a mental hospital by hearing his voice carrying through the air ducts
.
and here i thought it was wabbit season
. good god
, who rewrites theese movies
?
and do they arrive in nondescript black vehicles
?
