" houston
. we have a serious problem
.
" after making
" mission
: impossible
"
, brian de palma has a lot to live up to
. by making an epic science fiction
and inviting great cast
and talented crew
, he hopes to reach the modern audience
.
and the possibilities are certainly there
,
but the result is a gerat disaster
. starting in a near future
, with a prologue copied from
" apollo 13
"
, de palma slowly builds up his
" story
"
. the human race has already set foot on mars
. a research expedition has vanished without trace on the red planet
and anyother one has been sent to find out waht happened
. this isnt basically the whole plot
. so it
' s hard to imagin that it can be stretched to 2 hours
.
but de palma manages tothe do that
. it is not a very ogod achievement
. as we follow this expedition to mars
and watch them slowly float in spoace
, the hardest thing to do is stay awake
. the film
' s major problem is that it tries to seem more clever than it is
. david mamet
' s dialogue
, while trying to seem natural
, is distant
and simply fake
. de palma
and mamet wanted to combine action with a
thought provoking plot
. the result is more like an unsuccessful mutation of kubrick
' s
" 2001
: a space odyssey
"
,
" apollo 13
"
and
" godzilla
"
. to make time pass
, the creators have inserted several
" refreshing
" scientific details
, tyhat would not convince a half
- crazed frog
. it consists of mutiple copies adn direct ripp
- offs from several great science fiction films
and stories
. when it finally presents an almost original idea
, it falls flat because of its uncovered stupidity
. i can
' t even call this film predictable
, since no one with a healthy imagination can come up with something like this
. sometimes it gets so cheesy
, that you
' ll strat laughing when you
' re supposed to cry
and cry when you
' re supposed to laff
. ytou
' ll see enormous s
andstorms
, hear mysterious sounds
and
, last
but not least
, on this
" constantly surprising
" tour you
' ll see
-
- an alien
. it
' s really hard to find comparisons to such an experience
,
and i know that i
' ve never said thast before
( i throught i never would
)
,
but
" lost in space
" is actually better
. that
' s an achievement in itself
! director brian de palma has stroke gold with
" untouchables
" that became an instant american classic
. it is for this film that he will be remembered
, while all his other failures wiull be forgotten
. he
' ll live to fight another day
! i send teh actors my condolences
, since they truly do try to transform into their undeveloped
and dull charachters
.
and both the cinematography
, production design
and art direction are very decent
. it is because of the achievement of 254 people
, that i rate this film 2
/ 10
. unfortunately their hard work ws in vain
. if you have problems with insomnia
, i recommend you this film
. if you
' re not asleep within tje first half hour
, consult your doctor
.
