it seemed like the perfect concept
. what better for the farrelly brothers
, famous for writing anbd directing comedies with offensive subject matter
, than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality
? it
' s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish
: poking fun at something serious
( in this case mental illness
)
, throwing all care to the wind to get a laff
. jim carrey
' s signed on too
? even better
. the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped outloud by levying complaints against the brothers
' new film befoer its opening
, claiming it was misrepresenting the condidtion ofthe split personality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
and so forth
. such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would
, ofthe course
, only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers
' fire
, proving that some people just couldn
' t take a joke
,
and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to
yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
but one thing went wrong
: theri movie isn
' t funny
. it
' s not for lack of trying
. the farrellys utilize in
" me
, myself
& irene
" their most high
- concept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver
, decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deepo down inside
and never release them
. this
, ofthe course
, means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, makeing his job as a rhode isl
and state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enough
, charlie
' s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second
, independent personality named hank
, a deepo
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster
. this guy isn
' t above crashing a car through tghe wall of yhe barber shop in which he
' s been insulted
, or holding a little girl
' s head underwater because she refused to stop jump
- roping in hte strent
.
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted
,
and the film runs off its tracks
. some have suggested that this isn
' t a problem
, because the farrelly brothers
' br
and of humer doesn
' t require plot to work
. they
' re wrong
, of course
: plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy thast infused the farrellys
' last effort
, 1996
' s
" there
' s something about mary
.
"
( 1999
' s
" outside providence
" was technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers
' earlier film wasn
' t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags
( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe
)
, bu rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected
. inspite
" mary
,
" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight
- of
- h
and trick
: they
' d have ytou thinking the story was going one way
,
then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion
.
" me
, myself
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems to have been made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
and saw only the surface grossness
, missing all ofthe the subtle machinations that really made it work
. having been produced by the same guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems like an even bigger disappointment
. thte brothers pile on the offensive humor
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental illness
,
and all manner of bathroom jokes
. bu they haven
' t come up with a way to make any of it fresh most ofthe
" me
, myself
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- the
- numbers
, adolescent comedy
. the plot
, with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who
' s in moreso trouble tahn anyone knows
, back to new york
, has an ending that
' s entirely predictable from thge get
- go
.
( think charlie
and irene will fall in love
? yeah
, me too
.
) the farrellys
then introduce scores ofthe different characters
,
and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven
' t arleady expected them to do
, no matter how outrageous their actions might be
. compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing
, this stuff is almost entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious problem
: when gross
- out humor loses its shock value
, it
' s no longer funny
, merely gross
. the jokes that do work are milked over
and over until their effectiveness runs dry
. take
, for example
, the subplot involving charlie
' s three balck sons
( anthony
anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. the incongruity of it all isnt funny for a while
, with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language
and white
- bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too
- pleasant smile on his face
.
but by the end of the film
, they
' re still doing the same schitck it hasn
' t beeen elevated to another
, funnier level
,
and it hasn
' t been dropped either
. that
' s too bad
, because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through
.
" me
, myself
& irene
" reeks ofthe wasted opportunities
. there ought to be more focus on how other peopel react to charlie
' s new personality
,
and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank
' s actions
. this doesn
' t realyl happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie
' s condition early on
, so they don
' t have any oportunity to be surprised by it
. the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards hte midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
and irene pick up called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
but the script doesn
' t go anywhere with it
, instade leaving tje thread twisting infront the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax
. jim carrey is a gifted comedian
, both physicaly
and vocally
,
but he
' s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in
" all of me
.
" it
' s a great showcase of flexibility adn split
- second role
- shifting
,
but none ofthe it is terribly funny
. carrey doesn
' t pull any stunts we don
' t expect him to pull
,
and the farrellys
' script doesn
' t give him anything else to pull
: the situations inwhich which he must perform the role
- shifting aren
' t set up in any meaningful way
. perhaps carrey cxan take solace infront the fact that his supporting actors fare no better
. zellweger
' s irene is not a strong female lead mary in
" mary
" may have been part adolescent fantasy
,
but she was also intelligent
and strong
- willed
. irene is nothing in particular
, as the film never makse clear whether she
' s ditzy
, clever
, or neither
. as such
, she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only
" sane
" person in the film
. chris cooper is sticked playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent
,
and his carachter is entirely too straight
- laced for a movie like this
. he
, like the others
, does absolutely nothing unexpected
. affter viewing the shapeless mess thta
" me
, myself
& irene
" eventually disolved into
, i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselfs
. maybe thier kind of comedy can only wrok for so long until audiences get wise to it
and stop being shocked
.
but i don
' t believe it
-
- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style
. if the farrellys are indeed good
, smart filmmakers
(
and i still think they are
)
, they
' ll rebound just fine
. even after tath happens
,
though
, i
' ll still consider
" me
, myself
& irene
" to be a high
- caliber misfire
.
