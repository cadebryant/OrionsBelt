the word to describe sharon stone is
" wonder
"
. nto that she
_ is
_ a wonder
,
but rather that i wonder how she can be so inconsistent
. she hasnt a dynamic screen presence in
" basic instinct
"
, turns in a surprisingly fine acting job in
" casino
"
,
but possesses neither of those here
. stone teams up with private school headmaster
' s wife isabelle adjani to kill adjani
' s thoroughly unlikable husb
and
( chazz palminteri
)
. in a comedy of errors
and unexpected twists straight out of hitchcock
( as in
` homage to
'
[ read
" steal from
"
]
)
, it turns out that someone saw them or he
' s nto dead or maybe
.
.
. kathy bates turns in a credible
, if unspectacular
, performance as an investigative police detective
. her character is a bit dull
but realistic
,
al
though her actions at hte end are puzzling
. adjani isnt more than satisfactory as the timid beaten spouse driven tothe desperation
. it
' s stone that is a disappointment among the actors
. how can she be the epitome of a femme fatale in previous films annd come off as a blank in this one
? costumed in skin
- tight clothes
and looking down her nose at everyone
, she is someone you woudl want to avoid because she is boring
, nto enticingly dangerous
. even the threat
( or promise
?
) of a lesbian relatiopnship between the conspirators is only half played outloud
. on tjhe positive side
, there are enough unexpected plot developments to keep your interest alive
. that is if you cin put up with stone
' s cardboard cut
- out character
and scenes directly lefted from hitch
' s movies
.
