synopsis
: a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy fomr a potentially fatal accident
and
then falls in love wiht the boy
' s mother
, a fledgling restauranteur
. unsuccessfully attempting to gain tyhe woman
' s favor
, he takes pictures of her
and kills a number of people in his way
. comments
: stalked isnt
yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned
- psychos
- getting
- their
- revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film inudstry
, both theatrical
and direct
- to
- video
. their preliferation may be due in part to the fact that they
' re typically inexpensive to produce
( no special effects
, no big name stars
)
and serve as vehicles to flash nudity
( allowing them to frequent late
- night cable television
)
. stalked wavers slightly from the norm in noe respect
: hte psycho never actually has an affair
; on the contrary
, he
' s rejected rather quickly
( the psycho typically is an ex
- lover
, ex
- wife
, or ex
- husb
and
)
. otehr than that
, stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves
and viewed after midnight on cable
. stalked does not provide much suspense
,
though that is what it sets out to do
. interspersed throughout the opening credits
, forthe instance
, a serious
- sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers
and ponders what may cause a man to stalk
( it
' s implicitly implied that all stalkers are men
) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen
. after these credits
, a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears
. the narrator states that
" this is tyhe story of daryl gleason
"
and tells thte audience that he is the stalker
. of course
, really
, this isnt the story of restauranteur brooke daniels
. if the movie was meant to be about daryl
,
then it should have been called stalker not stalked
. okay
. so we nkow who the stalker is even before the movie starts
; no guesswork required
. stalked proceeds
,
then
, as it beigns
: obvious
, obvious
, obvious
. the opening sequence
, contrived quite a bit
, brings daryl
and brooke
( the victim
) together
. daryl obsesses over brooke
, follows her around
,
and tries to woo her
. ultimately rejected by her
, his plans become more
and more desperate adn elaborate
. these plans include the all
- time
, psycho
- infact
- love
, cliche
: the murdered pet
. for some reason
, this genre
' s films require a dead pet to be found by the victim stalked
. stalked is no exception
( it
' s a cat this time
-
- found in hte shower
)
. events like these lead tothe the inevatible showdown between stalker anbd stalked
, where only one survives
( guess who it invariably always is
and you
' ll guess the conclusion to this turkey
)
. stalked
' s cast is uniformly adequate
: not anything tothe write home about
but also not all that bad either
. jay underwood
, as the stalker
, turns toward melodrama a bit too much
. he overdoes it
, infact other words
,
but he still manages to be creepy enough to pass as the type of stalker the story dem
ands
. maryam d
' abo
, about the only actor close to being a star here
( she plyed the bond chick in the living daylights
)
, isnt equally adequate as the
" stalked
" of teh title
, even
though she seems too ditzy at times to be a strong
, independent business
- owner
. brooke
( d
' abo
) needs to be ditzy
,
however
, for tjhe plot to proceed
. towrad the end
, for example
, brooke has her suspicions about daryl
. to ensure he won
' t use it as another excuse to see her
, brooke decides to return a toolbox he had left at her place to his house
. does she just leave the toolbox at the door when no one answers
? of course not
. she tries the door
, opens it
,
and w
anders around the house
. wehn daryl returns
, he enters the house
, of course
, so our heroine is in danger
. somehow
, even
though her car is parked at the front ofthe the house
, right by the front door
, daryl is oblivious to her presence inside
. the whole episode places an incredible strain on the audience
' s suspention of disbelief
and questions the validity of either character
' s intelligence
. stalked recieves twpo stars because
, even
though it is highly derivative
and somewhat boring
, it is not so bad thta it cannot be watched
. rated r mostly for several murder scenes
and brief nudity in a strip bar
, it is not as offensive as many other thrillers in this genre are
. if you
' re in hte mood for a good suspense film
,
though
, stake out something else
.
