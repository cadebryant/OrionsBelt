your first clue that something isn
' t gonna be quite right with the movie you
' re about to see
: it
' s heavily christmas
- themed
and its release date is
, oh
, say
, at the end of february
. your second clue that something isn
' t gonna be quite right with tje movie you
' re about to see
: charlize theron
, one of the movie
' s dubious stars
, makes an appearance on tghe daily show in which
, when asked if her new movie
' s any good
, she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh
.
.
. assuring us tath
, yeah
, it sure is a movie
, all right
!
and there
' s some scenes like those you
' d expect to find in a movie
,
and there
' s some action
.
.
.
and there
' s other
.
.
. stuff
.
.
. too
. how to immediately grab my attention
: open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits
.
then sohw a caption reading
" six days earlier
.
.
.
" ya know
, i was honestly interested to find outloud what killed all thsoe poor santas
.
.
. how tothe immediately lose my attention
: follow your oppening scene with a terminally dull nice
- guys
- who
- don
' t
- deserve
- to
- be
- in
- prison scene
. write a line for the one of prisoners like
" i just want to go hmeo
and eat christmas dinner
and watch some ball with my dad
.
"
then
, have ben affleck actually say that line
, on film
,
and foreget to leave it on the cutting room floor
. for good measure
, throw in a poorly motiviated prison riot
and have affleck
' s best buddy stabbed
.
.
. aw
.
.
. adn just two days before his release
, too
. already the cliches are piled on thick
,
and when it rains
, it pours
. how to take my attention
, dash it violently against the rocks
,
and make it so that i
' m contemplating my strategy for calling
" shotgun
" about an hour before i know the credits will roll
: deny your charactors the ability to think
. have ben affleck
, for some reason i
' ll never underst
and
, pretend he
' s his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend
, played by charlize theron
. have gary sinise sohw up
and force the two of them tothe participate in a poorly planned casino heist
. the villains
' big idea
? kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino
, force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are
,
then dress up in santa suits
, create some
" diversions
"
and rob the place
. on paper
, it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy
,
but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper
and thinks he
' s looking at the makings for soem sort ofthe clever action
- crime thriller
. it
' s not like the man isn
' t capable
.
.
. far fomr it
. he
' s the man responisble for classic poltical thrillers like the manchurian c
andiate
and seven dyas in may
. he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i
' ve ever seen inspite last year
' s ronin
. bu he
' s certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers
.
.
. put reindeer games on the shelf ofthe shame with his 1996 verison of the isl
and of dr
. moreau
. step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible
: cast ben affleck inwhich the role of the world
' s most generic hero
. he gets no good one
- liners
, he doesn
' t get tothe shoot or implode anything in new
and interesting ways
,
and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief
and wants a cup of hot chocolate
and piece of pecan pie
. his nmae is rudy
( short for rudolph
, in all likelihood
. see
, it
' s called reindeer games
. get it
? get it
? shut up
.
) in the past
, affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor
,
and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man
. step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible
: gary sinise
' s villain dresses
and looks like the most st
andard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with
. he
' s dirty
and potty
- mouthed
, he
' s got long
, scruffy hair
and a goatee
,
and i fully expected him to walk out of teh casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them
. he
' s also extremely inept at what he does
. he thinks garish cowboy costumes
and santa suits make acceptable disguises
, annd he trusts affleck
' s character to pull through even after
, time
and time
and time again
, he tricks him
and lies to him
and nearly kills him
.
but instade of tapping into the comic possiblities ofthe thsi role
, sinise seems to think he
' s palying some sort of tough
, smart
,
and smooth criminal mastermind
, rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script
.
[ on a side onot
, gary sinise wins this week
' s
" title
!
" award
, as he
' s the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early inthe the proceedings
. last week
' s winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards
.
] how to take your bad idea annd make things worse
: include two or threee plot twists that
, instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent
, make the plan seem even more ridiculous
and unlikely
. this is a bad movie
.
and what
' s worse is that
, except for a fewd moments near the not
- so
- stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous
, reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad
. if they
' d done that much
, at least i would have been entertained
.
