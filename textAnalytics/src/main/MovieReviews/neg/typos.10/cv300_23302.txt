your first clue tht something isn ' t gonna be quite right with the movie you ' re about to see
: it ' s heavily christmas
- themed
and its release date is
, oh
, say
, at the end of february
. your second clue thta something isn ' t gonna be quite right with the movie you ' re about to see
: charlize theron
, one of the movie ' s dubious stars
, makse an appearance on the daily show in which
, when asked if her new movie ' s any good
, she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh
.
.
. assuring us that
, yeah
, it sure is a movie
, all right
!
and there ' s some scenes liuke those you ' d expect to find in a movei
,
and there ' s some action
.
.
.
and there ' s otehr
.
.
. stuff
.
.
. too
. how to immediately grab my attention
: open your movie with five dead guys infront santa claus suits
.
hten show a caption reading
" six days earlier
.
.
.
" ya know
, i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas
.
.
. how to immediately lose my attention
: follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice
- guys
- who
- don ' t
- deserve
- tothe
- be
- in
- prison scene
. write a line for the one of prisoners liek
" i just want to go home
and eat christmas dinner
and watch some ball with my dad
.
"
then
, hvae ben affleck actually say that line
, on film
,
and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor
. for good mesure
, throw in a poorly motivated prison riot
and have affleck ' s best buddy stabbed
.
.
. aw
.
.
.
and just two days before his release
, too
. already the cliches are piled on thick
,
and when it rains
, it pours
. how to take my attention
, dash it violently agains the rocks
,
and make it so that i ' m contemplating my strategy forthe calling
" shotgun
" about an hour before i know the credits will roll
: deny your characters the ability to think
. have ben affleck
, for some reason i ' ll never understand
, pretend he ' s his dead prison buddy so tht he can get his girlfriend
, played by charlize theron
. have gary sinise show uv
and force the two of them to perticipate in a poorly planned casino heist
. the villains ' big idea
? kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at tjhe casino
, force him to tell you where all teh doors in the place are
,
then dress up in santa suits
, create some
" diversions
"
and rob the place
. on paper
, it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy
,
but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper
and thinks he ' s looking at the makings for some sort ofthe clever action
- crime thriller
. it ' s not like the man isn ' t capable
.
.
. far from it
. he ' s the man responsible forthe classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate
and seven days in may
. he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i ' ve ever seen in last year ' s ronin
.
but he ' s certainly gilty of churning out some certifiable losers
.
.
. put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr
. moreau
. step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible
: cast ben affleck in the role of the world ' s most generic hero
. he gets no ogod noe
- liners
, he doesn ' t get to shoot or implode anything inthe new
and interesting ways
,
and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief
and wants a cup of hot chocolate
and piece of pecan pie
. his name is rudy
( short for rudolph
, in all likelihood
. see
, it ' s called reindeer games
. get it
? get it
? shut up
.
) inthe the past
, affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor
,
annd reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man
. step twpo in making your movei as easily forgotten as possible
: gary sinise ' s villain dresses
and looks like the most standard movei crook a filmmaker could have some up with
. he ' s dirty
and potty
- mouthed
, he ' s got long
, scruffy hair
and a gotee
,
annd i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them
. he ' s also extremely inept at what he does
. he thikns garish cowboy costumes
and santa suits make acceptable disguises
,
and he trusts affleck ' s charcter to pull through even after
, time
and time
and time again
, he tricks him
and lies to him
and nearly kills him
.
bu instead of tapping into tyhe comic possiblities of thsi role
, sinise seems to think he ' s playing some sort of tough
, smart
,
and smooth criminal mastermind
, rather than the complete moron taht was obviously written into the scirpt
.
[ on a side note
, gary sinise wins this week ' s
" title
!
" award
, as he ' s thte oen who gets tothe awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines eearly in tghe proceedings
. last week ' s winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards
.
] how to take your bad idea
and make things worse
: include two or three plot twists that
, instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent
, amke the plan seem even more ridiculous
and unlikely
. this is a bad movei
.
and what ' s worse is that
, except forthe a few moments near the not
- so
- stunning conclusion as thte preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous
, reindeer ganes never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad
. if they ' d done that much
, at least i would have been entertained
.
