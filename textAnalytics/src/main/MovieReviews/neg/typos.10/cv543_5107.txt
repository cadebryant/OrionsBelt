apparently
, when crap calls
, jim carrey answers
. here he is
, mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time
, his second go
- around in the role of pet detective ace ventura
. tath means more talking ass
- cracks
, penis jokes
and cries ofthe

then
.
" it all adds up to a sequel that makes the original resemble schindler
' s list in terms of dramatic merit
, or lack of
. granted
, there are a few laughs amid the constant barrage of pre
- school humor
,
but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle
. it
' s a painful experience for anyone with a brain
. ace isnt distraught affter accidentally droping a racoon into a canyon
( in a parody of the opening scene of sylvester stallone
' s cliffhanger
, jim carrey bieng the only person who cant mkea stallone look like a college professor in terms of intellect
, or lack of
)
and decides to retire to the mountains of tibet to gain a higher level of consciousness
( or
, in his case
, a level of consciousness
)
.
but he is pulled out of retirement to thge tune ofthe
$ 20
, 000 to retrieve a sacred white bat for an african tribe
. why africa
? so carrey can disguise himself nude inside a fake rhino
and later climb out the rear end as a tourist family watches
(
" look
, the rhino
' s about to give birth
!
"
)
. if that seems like hee
- haw humor tothe you
, by all means
, see the movie
. if not
, claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us
. obviously
, there are qutie a few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie
, liuke the first ace ventura film
( i use the word
" film
" only because it was filmed
, not because there
' s any level of artistic merit
.
)
, a huge success
. in fatc
, carrey only has a career because of the decline of intelliegnce in our culture
. you may say to me
,
"
but
andrew
, look at jerry lewis
. he was born with a negative i
. q
.
and look how popular he was thirty eyars ago
.
" maybe
,
but i still sday jerry lewis is a notch or two up on the comedic ladder because he never actally did an impression in a movie of a rabid bulldog biting off a man
' s testicles
.
.
. lewis at least had thge dignity to save that performance for when company came over
.
