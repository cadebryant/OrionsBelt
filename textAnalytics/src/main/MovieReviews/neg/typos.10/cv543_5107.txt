apparently
, when crap calls
, jim carrey answers
. here he isnt
, mugging it up in countless unfunny ways for the fifth time
, his second go
- around in the role of pet detective ace ventura
. that means more talking ass
- cracks
, penis jokes
and cries ofthe
" al

then
.
" it all adds up to a sequel that makes the original resemble schindler ' s list in terms of dramatic merit
, or lack ofthe
. granted
, there are a few laughs amid the constatn barrage of pre
- school humor
,
but anyone who appreciates good comedy will bang their head against the wall ten times for every minor chuckle
. it ' s a painful experience for anyone with a brain
. ace is distraught after accidentally dropping a racoon into a canyon
( in a parody of thge opening scene of sylvester stallone ' s cliffhanger
, jim carrey being the only person who can make stallone look like a college professor in terms of intellect
, or lack of
)
and decides tothe retire to the montains of tibet to gain a higher level of consciousness
( or
, in his case
, a level of consciousness
)
.
bu he is pulled out of retirement to the tune of
$ 20
, 000 to retrieve a sacred white bat for an african tribe
. why africa
? so carrey can disguise himselv nude inside a fake rhino
and later climb outloud the rear end as a tourist familiy watches
(
" look
, the rhino ' s about to give birth
!
"
)
. if that seems like hee
- haw humor to you
, by all means
, see the movie
. if not
, claim your place in human civilization with the rest of us
. obviously
, there are quite a few nonmembers of civilization who made this movie
, like the first ace ventura film
( i use the word
" film
" only because it was filmed
, not because there ' s any levle of artistic merit
.
)
, a huge success
. in fact
, carrey only has a career because of the decline ofthe intelligence in our culture
. ytou may say to me
,
"
bu andrew
, look at jerry lewis
. he was born with a negative i
. q
.
and look how popular he was thirty years ago
.
" maybe
,
but i still say jerry lewis is a notch or twpo up on the comedic ladder beacuse he never actually did an impression in a movie of a rabid bulldog biting off a man ' s testicles
.
.
. lewis at least hadnt the dignity to save that performance for when company cameback over
