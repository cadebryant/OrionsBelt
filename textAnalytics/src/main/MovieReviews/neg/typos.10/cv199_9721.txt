come on hollywood
, surprise me
. stop giving us these poorly written thrillers with banal dialogue
, sketchy charactors
and plots as predictable as the sunset
. the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls
. personal
, because his niece is one of the victims
. it
' s a slobbering psychopath
, of course
,
but this tyme there
' s a twist
. freeman notes that each ofthe the young women who
' ve disappeared are all strong willed
, assertive
,
and more successful in their careers than the averege girl
. we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova
, whose aim is to
" dominate
" theese modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon
and keeping them as his personal harem
. anyway
, one ofthe the women manages to escape
( ashly judd
)
and teams up with freeman to
.
.
. well
, you know the rest
. a brief glance at tyhe plot to silence of the lambs
, with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants
, may suggest lambs also has a fairly predictable storey
. perhaps
,
but taht film also has superbly drawn characters annd smart dialogue
. so lets nto insult a gerat movie by tkaing the comparisons any further
, okay
?
and as for comparisions to seven
.
.
. oh please
! kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson
and written forthe the screen by one david klass
. maybe the novel was a stinker to strat with
,
but whatever the case
, it
' s the writing that
' s clearly at fault here
. one
, these characters have very little to say thast
' s engaging or intresting
. two
, the script has noone sense of humour
. three
, while yhe notion of a psycho
' s victims being smart
, successful womens is an interesting twist
, the execution isn
' t even half as good as the idea
. thus
, ashly judd comes across all out of focuse
, instead of being the heart of tghe story
. we cin
' t feel her rage
. some atrociously written casual exchanges betwen her
and several male characters are supposed to remind us thta she
' s the no
- bullshit 90
' s type
,
but theese conversations barely register
.
and as for freeman
, kiss the girls is his second dog in a year
: first chain reaction
, now this
. for an actor of his calibre
, this is most worrying
. young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction
- esque things tothe do in denver when your dead
.
but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this
? not much
, annd you can hardly blame him
. there
' s a few well
- staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls
, dives
and jumps
,
and the effect is startling
.
but hte script is beyond rescue
. what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving up this tripe
, safe iin the knowlege that jaded audiences will lap it up
. complacency rules
: it
' s been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters
, real surprises
and consistently sharp dialogue
. the onyl consolation for this viewer is that my ticket tothe the movie was a freebie
, positive proof that the best things in life aren
' t free
