come on hollywood
, surprise me
. stop giving us these poorly written thrillers whith banal dialogue
, sketchy characters
and plots as predictable as the sunset
. the always watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personally involved in a case involving missing girls
. personal
, because his niece is one of the victims
. it ' s a slobbering psychopath
, of course
,
but this time htere ' s a twist
. freeman notes that each of the young women who ' ve disappeared are all strong willed
, assertive
,
and more successful in their careers than the average girl
. we soon learn that the guy calls himself casanova
, whose aim is to
" dominate
" these modern gals by imprisoning them in some dungeon
adn keeping them as his personal harem
. anyway
, one of the women manages to escape
( ashly judd
)
and teams up with freeman to
.
.
. well
, you know the rest
. a brief glance at the plot to silence of the lambs
, with which this film is constantly being compared to by the hype merchants
, may suggest lambs also hasnt a fairly predictable story
. perhaps
,
bu that film allso has superbly drawn characters
and smart dialogue
. so lets not insult a great movie by taking the comparisons any further
, okay
?
and as for comparisons to seven
.
.
. oh please
! kiss the girls is based on the novel by james patterson
and written for the screen by one david klass
. maybe the novel was a stinker to start with
,
bu whatever the case
, it ' s the writing that ' s clearly at fault here
. one
, these characters have very little tothe say that ' s engaging or interesting
. twpo
, the script has no sense of humour
. three
, while the notion ofthe a psycho ' s victims being smart
, successful women is an interesting twist
, the execution isn ' t even half as good as thte idea
. thus
, ashly judd comes across all out of focus
, instead ofthe bieng the heart of the stopry
. we can ' t feel her rage
. some atrociously written casual exchanges between her
and several male characters are supposed to remind us that she ' s the no
- bullshit 90 ' s type
,
but these conversations barely registre
.
and as fo freeman
, kiss the girls is his second dog inspite a year
: first chain reaction
, now this
. for an actor ofthe his calibre
, this is most worrying
. young director gary fleder scored a hit a few years back with his quirky pulp fiction
- esque things to do in denver when your dead
.
but what can he do with material as resolutely mediocre as this
? not much
,
and you can hardly blame him
. ther ' s a few well
- staged chase scenes through the forest where the camera whirls
, dives
and jumps
,
and hte effect is startling
.
but the script is beyond rescue
. what hurts most is that hollywood continues to get away with serving uv htis tripe
, safe in the knowledge thast jaded audiences will lap it up
. complacency rules
: it ' s been so long since we saw a mainstream american thriller that delivered juicy characters
, real surprises
and consistently sharp dialogue
. the only consolation for this viewer is thast my ticket to thte movie was a freebie
, positive proof that the best things in life aren ' t free
.
