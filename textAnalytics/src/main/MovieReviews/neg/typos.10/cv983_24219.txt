tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around amercia who is trying tothe prove tht she did not kill her spouse
. thge fugitive
? not quite
? this is the plot for double jeopardy
, another fugitive copycat wihtout the action
, excitement
,
and good acting that the original had
. ther are other slight differences besides one movie being bad
and the other good
; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall
, clever huh
? oh
and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband
( bruce greenwood
) who needed tothe collect two million dollars in life insurance money nto a one armed man
. both movies are on video
. make the wise choice
and pick the fugitive
. ther are so many flaws in double jeopardy
, it is laughable
. while serving time in prison
, libby parsons
( judd
) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice
. learning that her husband is still alive
, she decides tothe serve her time in prison
, find him
, retrieve her son
,
and kill her husband if necessary
. whn the strict parole officer travis lehman
( jones
) stands in her way
, libby decides to break the rules
( who knows why
?
)
and continue her plan
, despite the fact that if she gets caught
, she ' s going bakc to jail
. directer bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son
. every other scene
, we are given a shot of libby staring
and crying at his picture
. in an acation movie like this
, valuble time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to git up
and do something
. all that is needed in this type of movei is a short scene in hwihc libby tells herself or a friend
" i miss my son
.
" nothing more
, nothing less
. dr
. kimble of the fugitive didn ' t look at one picture of his dead wife
, his primary concern was to save himself
. libby at times shows this smae determination
but not nearly enough
. ashley judd
and bruce greenwood both are exellent actors
but if they continue to do movies liek this
, tehy will be typecast for the rest of their careers
, kind ofthe like their doomed co
- star tommy lee jones
. winning an oscar fo the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i
- do
- my
- job
- whether
- they
- are
- innocent
- or
- guilty roles
. people still pay to see his movies
and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right
.
though i don ' t think he will win another oscar again
. the ultimate mistake in thte script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons
. even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer
, the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count
. burglary
, assault
, grand theft auto are some ofthe libby ' s slipups
. the message of the movie is yuo can break all of the small laws as long as you ' re innocent of the major crime
. hopefully criminals won ' t use double jeapardy as a reference infact cout for why they are innocent
. that would just be plain stupid
.
