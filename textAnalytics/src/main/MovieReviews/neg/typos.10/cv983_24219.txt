tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying tothe prove that she did not kill her spouse
. the fugitive
? not qutie
? this is hte plot forthe double jeapardy
, another fugitive copycat without the action
, excitement
,
and good acting that thge original had
. htere are other slight differences besides one movei being bad
and the other good
; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall
, clever huh
? oh
and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husb
and
( bruce greenwood
) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man
. both movies are on video
. make the wise choice
and pik the fugitive
. there are so many flaws in double jeopardy
, it is laughable
. while serving time in prison
, libby parsons
( judd
) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice
. learning that her husb
and is still alive
, she decides to serve her time in prison
, find him
, retrieve her son
,
and kill her husb
and if necessary
. when the strict parole officer travis lehman
( jones
) st
ands in her way
, libby decides to break the rules
( who knows why
?
) adn continue her plan
, despite the fact that if she gets caught
, she
' s going back to jail
. director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying tothe convince the audience that libby misses her son
. every other scene
, we are given a shot of libby staring anbd crying at his picture
. in an action movie like this
, valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to git uv
and do something
. all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a firend
" i miss my son
.
" nothing more
, nothing less
. dr
. kimble of the fugitive didn
' t look at noe picture of his dead wife
, his primary concern was to save himself
. libby at times shows this smae determination
but not nearly enough
. ashley judd adn bruce greenwood both are excellent actors bu if they continue to do movies like this
, they will be typecast for the rest of their careers
, kind of liuke their doomed co
- star tommy lee jones
. winning an oscar fo the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences iwll never get tired of his i
- do
- my
- job
- whther
- htey
- are
- innocent
- or
- gilty roles
. people still pay to see his movies
and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right
.
though i don
' t think he will win another oscar again
. tjhe ultimate mistake in the script is what eventally becomes of libby parsons
. even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer
, the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count
. burglary
, assault
, gr
and theft auto are some of libby
' s slipups
. the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you
' re innocent of the major crime
. hopefully criminals won
' t use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent
. that would just be plain stupid
.
