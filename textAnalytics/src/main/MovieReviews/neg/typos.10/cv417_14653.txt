the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer
and director john maybury ' s love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon
. as always
, jacobi ' s acting is impeccable
,
but the movie trys hard
annd succeeds at being unentertaining
and opaque
. tjhe movie convincingly argues tyhat francis
, played by jacobi
, was a completely despicable
and vain individual
,
but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude
. when interviewed by a fawning talk sohw host
, francis calls his style
" chance brushstrokes
.
" starting with a burglary of francis ' s flat
, the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie
. the camera shots are heavy on the avant
- garde angles
-
- lots of wide
- angle close
- ups
and distorted shots filmed through colored
- glass reflections
. the director is much more intersted in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination ofthe a lonely
and vain man
. daniel craig
, inthe a lifeless performance
, plays the burglar
and boxer
, george dyer
. when francis lays eyes onthe him after the break
- in
, francis promises not to call the police if he ' ll stay for sex
. he stays for the entire movie
but never respects tje man with whom he shares a bed
. he thinks that francis ' s paintings ahve
" no bloody use
,
"
and the movie presents noone counterargument
. writer maybury bearly outlines francis ' s character
,
and george
and the rest ofthe the supporting casted remain a complete enigma
. we learn littel of george other than francis ' s reason for liking him
-
- george ' s
" amorality
and innocence
.
" francis ' s love of sadomasochism is shown early
and often
.
" boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex
,
" he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match
. as the fighter ' s head isnt sliced open with a heavy blow
, the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood
. francis appears to be in complete ecstasy
. another of francis ' s favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities
. as the carnage mounts
, we witness an orgasmically hapyp francis in the audiance
. in a film that trys obsessively to shock
, one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident
. francis ' s mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother
, the father
,
and the boy
. sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis ' s wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful
.
(
" i ' m optimistic by nature
. i ' m optimistic about nothing
.
"
" loneliness is my only true companion
.
"
) we learn more details about francis ' s makeup techniques than about the man himself
. he prefers shoe polish for his hair
and sink cleaning powder for his teeth
. full of metaphorical interpretations
, teh film ' s best scene occurs late one night when george has to get uv to go to the bathroom
. mistaking francis ' s picture of a toilet fo the genuine article
, he urinates on it
and
then crawls back into bed contentedly
. like a parody of a bad art house movie
, love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely
and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling
. by the end
, tje audience hasn ' t learned any moreso than it could have in a three
- minute sketch
. love is the devil runs 1
: 30
. the film is not rated
but should be considered nc
- 17 for voilence
, profanity
, graphic sex
, nudity
and sadomasochism
adn is unacceptable for most teenagers
