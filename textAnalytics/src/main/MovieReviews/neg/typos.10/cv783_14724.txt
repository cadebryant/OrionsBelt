there isn
' t much good about this movie
. not much i can say about the acting
, directing
, or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie
. so i
' ll get my one good comment out of the way
, at least joel schuemacher
( batman
& robin
) didn
' t direct it or it would be titled
" technicolor city
"
. in fact htere is nothing colorful about this movie
, its dark anbd depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end
. the plot has a tendency to be interesting
,
but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what sould have been a fascinating movie
. the plot is impossible to explain due tothe how senseless it gets
, so i will just touch on the bare minimum
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel
, onyl to find out he has forgotten everything
. john must find out who he isnt befor the
" strangers
"
( a
. k
. a
. mind erasing aliens
) find him
and use him for their own evil conspiracy
. during the film some intresting points are rised about human individuality
,
and the existence of inherently evil people
. any of these points
however are completly
" erased
" from your mind as you watch the actors stumble thru tghe dreadful scirpt
. as i mentioned earlier
, nothing
but the atmosphere is right in this film
. the acting is bl
and
,
and usance there is virtually no character development no one seems to care
. the special effects are low budget
and some even hilariously fake
, a sign of a true
" b
- movie
"
. the direction is poor
and there is little continuty
, not thta you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly
. lastly the script is weak
and has no consept ofthe reality
,
and doesn
' t deserve to have the word
" science
" in science
- fiction
. if i haven
' t got my point acrost
, i
' ll say it more plainly
: this is a bad movie
. lets hope the next movie by alex
" i wish i was tim burton
" proyas is at least tolerable
.
