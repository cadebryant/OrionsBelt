there isn ' t much good about this movie
. not much i can say about the acting
, directing
, or writing that would make you consider seing this movie
. so i ' ll get my one good comment out of the way
, at least joel schuemacher
( batman
& robin
) didn ' t direct it or it would be titled
" technicolor city
"
. iin fact there is nothing colorful about this movie
, its dark
and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end
. the plot hasnt a tendency to be intresting
,
but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could ahve been a fascinating movie
. the plot isnt impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets
, so i will just touch on tjhe bare minimum
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel
, onyl to find out he has forgotten everything
. john must find outloud who he is before the
" strangers
"
( a
. k
. a
. mind erasing aliens
) find him
and use him for their own evil conspiracy
. during the film smoe interesting points are raised about human individuality
,
and the existence ofthe inherently evil peple
. any of these points
however are completely
" erased
" from your mind as you watch yhe actors stumble thru the dreadful script
. as i mentioned ealier
, nothing
but the atmosphere is right in this film
. tjhe acting is bland
,
anbd since there is virtually noone character development no one seems to care
. the special effects are low budget
and some even hilariously fake
, a sign of a true
" b
- movie
"
. the direction is poor
and there is littel continuity
, not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly
. lastly thte script is weak
and has no consept ofthe reality
,
and doesn ' t deserve to have the word
" science
" in science
- fiction
. if i haven ' t got my point across
, i ' ll say it more plainly
: this is a bad movie
. lets hope the next movie by alex
" i wish i was tim burton
" proyas is at least tolerable
.
