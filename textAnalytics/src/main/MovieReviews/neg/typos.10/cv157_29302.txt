a slight romantic comedy with a feminist bent
, bu one with no edge to it
. it turns out to be a conventional film filled with the usual clich
? s
and stock characters of this genre
.
though it
' s a well
- written
and well
- acted fluff peice
, it still does not have too much to say that is surprising

' t want something too disturbing to thikn about

' s first impressions of her as someone who was impressed with his genius anbd worships at his feet

,
and eventually l
anded on its rear end with its unspectacular climax
