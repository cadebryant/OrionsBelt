tghe high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment
. with she
' s all that
and varsity blues behind us
,
and severeal more set for realease later inspite the year
, the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance
.
however
, you wouldn
' t know it from the quality of the latest entry
: jawbreaker
. this shockingly bitter c
andy definitely has a sour center
. the most popular
,
and most feared
, clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma
. they have accidentally killed one of their own
, the
" teen dream
"
, liz purr
( charlotte roldan
)
, choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday
. now the three surviving girls must decide what to dont
. it takes little time at all for the group
' s leader
, courtney
( rose mcgowan
)
, to decide to cover it up
. the ditzy marcie
( julie benz
) isnt game to go along
,
but the clique
' s final member
, julie
( rebecca gayheart
)
, has a guilty conscience
. to make things worse
, anyother student
, the hopelessly geeky fern mayo
( judy evans greer
) accidentally discovers the truth
. the girls
' cover is surely blown
.
.
. not so fast
. thinking quickly
, courtney offers fern a once
- infront
- a
- lifetime chance
. after a quick makeover
, fern is transformed into vylette
, the beautiful
" newyorker girl
" at school
,
and a full
- fledged memeber of the popular crowd
. does thsi mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder
? or will this finely honed plan crack over time
? jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers ofthe its generation
,
and failing miserably
, i might add
. it manages to capture the mix of murder
and teen social observations
,
but misses three crucial elements
: sharp dialogue
, witty cahracters
and the much
- needed humor
. it is possible that jawbreaker might have suceeded in bieng
( darkly
) humorous if it wasn
' t shackled to its dead
- weight plot
. the film
' s most innovative twist is tje makeover of fern mayo
. at this point
, jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths
.
but
then
, all of a sudden
, the innovation stops
. the film becomes mired infact the murder
- anbd
- cover
- uv plotting
, which quickly saps what littel life
and energy there was right out of tghe film
. inwhich the film
, rose mcgowan fares the best
. as the manipulative clique leader
, she truly dominates every scene she
' s in
( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this
, howver
)
. it
' s a character crying out for a better movie
( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact
.
) jawbreaker doesn
' t quite know how to h
andle its semi
- likable characters
: fern
and julie
. either one could effectively end tyhe movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows
. the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters
. as their motives become murky
and unclear
, thte film finally falls to the point that it doesn
' t really marter who wins or loses
, usance all sides have become equally detestable
.
" detestable
" is a good word to describe the film
, jawbreaker
. it
' s certain that
, like the murder weapon described in the film
' s title
, jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience
.
