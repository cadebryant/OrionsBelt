` the skulls ' is a laughably bad thriller
, a teen
- orientated doppelganger of
` the firm ' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor
. certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attemt to stifle laughter
. i chuckled incessantly
, all the way home
. let me share
. teh skulls is a scret society conceived inside tyhe walls of yale
( designed
, i ' m sure
, to mirror the actuall skull
& bones from the same college
)
. luke mcnamara
( joshua jackson
)
, a townie
and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year
, highlights the latest skull scouting report
. despite some anxiety
and caution from others
, luke accepts entry into the organiztion
. soon aftter
, he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women
, driving a new car
and marveling at the
$ 20
, 000 tht somehow surfaced in his bank account
. yeah
, dude
, pretty ogod deal eh
?
but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating
; when circumstances become extreme
, there is no way he can leave the society
- except maybe as a drooling vegetable
. the premise
,
although lacking in originality
, certainly offers its share of potential intrigue
and suspense
. unfortunately
,
` the skulls ' is niether intriguing
, nor suspenseful
, nor anytying else you would associate with fresh or exciting
. it ' s just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack
, the stars
.
.
.
.
but not the script
.
` the skulls ' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value
, with hte screenplay
, by jon pogue
, immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers
. first off
, upon their initiation into the skulls
, each new member has to have a skull branded onto thier arm
. afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar
. will they never take this watch off
?
and what if they forget it by their bedside
? perhaps their
? secret ' society was being a little too conspicuous whn they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area ofthe thge body that is easily exposed
. on top of this
, they are each given a rulebook
and a key to headquarters
. gee
, why not member t
- shirts
?
but my favorite bit is tihs
: the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual
? agree ' or
? disagree ' notions wehn making collective decisions
. they are given official skull paddles
. when flipped to one side
, they indicate the member agrees with the proposal
. facing the opposite way means a disagreement
. wouldn ' t tehy merely express themselves verbally
? hell no
. they have tothe retrieve the paddles for a proper vtoe
,
and maybe afterward they can play ping
- pong
. i ' m still chuckling about these ludicrous details
,
but the humiliating dialogue is enough tothe send one into arrest
. the cast
, meanwhile
, combines a pinch ofthe veteran talent with a dash of the
` dawson ' s creek ' crowd
,
and fuses the two together
, ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout
.
bu not entirely
. accomplished actors like craig t
. nelson
( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake
)
and william peterson
( as fellow board member senator levritt
) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures
,
and look suitably embarrassed handling them
.
and
then there ' s christopher mcdonald
, who has tje capacity to be a fun
, exciting actor
. mcdonald ' s charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role
( yes
, pogue makes it a hat
- trick
)
. i pray it was a
` snatch
- the
- paycheck
-
and
- run ' exercise for all these actors
. thge young troupe ofthe performers involved fair moderately better
. let ' s cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character
. paul walker
, the strapping quaterback from
` varsity blues '
, is bland
but passable as caleb mandrake
- the judge ' s son
. walker preserves a straight face
, even when dealt the silliest dialogue in thge movie
(
` dad
, i jsut killed a guy in the ritual room
! '
)
. some actuall spark is generated by leslie bibb
, who plays luke ' s longtime chum chloe
,
and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics
. it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute oen
. or maybee not minute one
, thanks to a decent set
- up from director rob cohen
, who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere
and style
. it makes you wonder why he didn ' t flee indefinitely from the project
, because while enjoyable cheese like
` dragonheart '
and the moderate stallone thriller
` daylight ' aren ' t superior cinema
, they belong on the afi top 100 list when compaired to this degrading trash
. aside from unintentionally humoring tjhe audience
,
` the skulls ' gets little accomplished
. the thrills
adn action are lazy
and mechanical
. the story is stuffed with ridiculous
, formulaic plotting thast sheepishly overlooks tghe cool potential of a escret underground society flick
. instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization
, we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from eccessive usage
. we ' ve seen it all before
,
and better
.
` the skulls ' isnt a feeble little circus of stupidity
, so miscalculated that
-
- hwile it would serve as a clever pun
-
- a term like
? boneheaded ' seems just too generous
.
