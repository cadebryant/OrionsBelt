` the skulls
' is a laughably bad thriller
, a teen
- orientated doppelganger of
` the firm
' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor
. certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attept to stifle laughter
. i chuckled incessantly
, all tjhe way hmeo
. let me share
. the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale
( desgined
, i
' m sure
, to mirror the actual skull
& bones from the same college
)
. luke mcnamara
( joshua jackson
)
, a townie
and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year
, highlights the latest skull scouting report
. despite soem anxiety
and caution from others
, luke accepts entry into the organization
. soon after
, he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women
, driving a new car
and marveling at the
$ 20
, 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account
. yeah
, dude
, pretty good deal eh
?
but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating
; when circumstances become extreme
, htere is no way he can leave the society
- except maybe as a drooling vegetable
. the premise
,
al
though lacking inthe originality
, certainly offers its share of potential intrigue
and suspense
. unfourtunately
,
` the skulls
' is neither intriguing
, nor suspenseful
, nor anything else yuo would associate with fresh or exciting
. it
' s just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack
, the stars
.
.
.
.
but not the script
.
` the skulls
' isnt so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value
, with the screenplay
, by jon pogue
, immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers
. first off
, upon thier initiation into the skulls
, each new member has to have a skull br
anded onto their arm
. afterward htey are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar
. will they never take tihs watch off
?
and what if they forget it by their bedside
? perhaps their
? secret
' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to br
and new munbers liuke cattle on an area ofthe the body that is easily exposed
. on top of this
, they are each given a rulebook
and a key to headquarters
. gee
, why not member t
- shirts
?
but my favorite bited is this
: the voting committee fo the skulls does not bother with individual
? agree
' or
? disagree
' notions when making collective decisions
. they are given official skull paddles
. wehn flipped to one side
, they indicate the member agrees iwth the proposal
. facing the opposite way means a disagreement
. wouldn
' t they merely express themselfs verbally
? hell no
. they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote
,
and maybe afterward they can play ping
- pong
. i
' m still chuckling about these ludicrous details
,
but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest
. the cast
, meanwhile
, combines a pinch ofthe veteran talent with a dash of the
` dawson
' s creek
' crowd
,
and fuses the two together
, ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout
. bu not entirely
. accomplished actors like craig t
. nelson
( as skulls chairman judge litten m
andrake
) anbd william peterson
( as fellow board memeber senator levritt
) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures
,
and look suitably embarrassed h
andling them
.
and
then there
' s christopher mcdonald
, who has the capacity to be a fun
, exciting actor
. mcdonald
' s charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role
( yes
, pogue makes it a hat
- trck
)
. i pray it was a
` snatch
- the
- paycheck
-
and
- run
' exercise for all these actors
. the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better
. let
' s cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines ofthe his character
. paul walker
, tghe strapping quarterback from
` varsity blues
'
, is bl
and
but passable as caleb m
andrake
- the judge
' s son
. walker preserves a straight face
, even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie
(
` dad
, i just killed a guy in the ritual room
!
'
)
. some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb
, who plays luke
' s longtime chum chloe
,
and manages to successfully pull off soem convincing dramatics
. it really boils down to the actors atempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one
. or maybe not minute one
, thanks to a decent set
- up from director rob cohen
, who films early sequences witht a sense of atmosphere
and style
. it makes yuo wonder why he didn
' t flee indefinitely from the project
, because while enjoyable cheese like
` dragonheart
'
and the moderate stallone thriller
` daylight
' aren
' t superior cinema
, they belong onthe the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash
. aside from unintentionally humoring the audience
,
` the skulls
' gets little accomplished
. the thrills
and acation are lazy
and mechanical
. the story is stuffed with rediculous
, formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the kool potential of a secret underground society flick
. instead of gaining knowledge baout the skulls as an organization
, we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage
. we
' ve seen it all before
, adn better
.
` the skulls
' is a feeble little circus of stupidity
, so miscalculated that
-
- while it would serve as a clever pun
-
- a term liuke
? boneheaded
' seems just too generous
.
