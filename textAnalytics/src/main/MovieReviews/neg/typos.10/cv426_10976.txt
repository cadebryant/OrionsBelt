" deepo rising
" gives you that sinking feeling both literally
and figuratively
: not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid
- like menace
,
but the unfolding stor isnt artificial
, silly adn alomst completely derivative of countless other
(
and
, for the most part
, better
) films
. while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures
-
- take
, for example
, the schlocky mountain highs of last spring
' s
" anaconda
"
-
-
" deep rising
" has no tongue to put inaddition its cheek
. folks
, we
' re only a month into the newyorker year
,
and already here
' s a c
andidate for one of its stinkiest releases
. most of tje action takes place on the argonautica
, a luxury liner in hte middle of its maiden voyage
( uh
- oh
-
- if these peopel had seen
" titanic
,
"
then maybe they
' d have known to stay home
) when it
' s attacked by a giant
, tentacled sea creature
. the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian
( famke janssen
)
, argonautica owner canton
( anthony heald
)
and a faw other crew members
. a mercenary team
, lead by resourceful captain john finnegan
( treat williams
)
, board thte argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby
. bu what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood
- soaked
, hungry
and not veyr helpful
. the main problem with
" deep rising
" is its overt familiarity
; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci
- fi
/ horror films in recent memory
. the concept is
" leviathan
" meets
" titanic
,
" with a dash of
" speed 2
" thrown in forthe ogod
( or is that bad
?
) measure
. this monster is equal parts
" 20
, 000 leagues under the sea
"
and
" the relic
,
" knows how to open doors like the raptors from
" jurassic park
"
and even gets to expel a half
- digested victim
( a neat effect
, admitedly
) a la the giant snake in
" anaconda
.
" some of the attack sequences are straight out of
" jaws
"
and
" alien
.
" a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water tothe escape death isnt right out ofthe
" alien resurrection
.
" there
' s even a jet ski chase like
" hard rain
.
"
and the list goes on
. watching
" deep rising
"
' s cast battle the beast is a murky chore inthe itself
, because none of them have well
- devolopped characters
, nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy
. williams is affable enough
, bu his finnegan just isn
' t believable
. an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted
; pretty famke janssen
, best known as
" goldeneye
"
' s killer thighs
, is trapped in a forced rumatic interest with williams
, hwile kevin j
. o
' connor
, as finnegan
' s mechanic
, provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast
. djimon honsou
, who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december
' s
" amistad
,
" pops up in a breef part
. he needs to stay away from hte water
. the movie
' s final shot is a groaner
, as is the 11th
- hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on
- ship sabotour
. as if a cast deserving of their snack food
- fate isn
' t bad enought
( when you taunt the monster
, you
' re really asking for it
)
,
" deep rising
" is a slow
, stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot
.
and since we all konw that the higher the casualty rate is
, the closer we are to thge end of the movie
, rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn
' t out of the question
.
