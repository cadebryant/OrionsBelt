" deepo rising
" gives you that sinking feeling both literally
and figuratively
: not only does the movei take place onthe a cruise ship slowy bieng immersed into the middle of tje ocean by a squid
- like menace
,
but the unfolding story is artificial
, silly
and almsot completely derivative of countless otehr
(
and
, for the most part
, better
) films
. while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures
-
- take
, for example
, the schlocky mountain highs of last spring ' s
" anaconda
"
-
-
" deep rising
" has no tongue to put in its cheek
. folks
, we ' re only a month into the new year
,
and already here ' s a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases
. most of the action takes place on the argonautica
, a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage
( uh
- oh
-
- if these people had seen
" titanic
,
"
then maybe they ' d have known to stay hmeo
) wehn it ' s attacked by a giant
, tentacled sae creature
. the only survivors are slinky jewel theef trilian
( famke janssen
)
, argonautica owner canton
( anthony heald
)
and a few other crew members
. a mercernary team
, lead by resourceful captian john finnegan
( treat williams
)
, board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby
.
but what their search of yhe ship uncovers is something blood
- soaked
, hungry
and not very helpful
. the main problem with
" deep rising
" is its overt familiarity
; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci
- fi
/ horror films in recent memory
. hte concept is
" leviathan
" meets
" titanic
,
" with a dash ofthe
" speed 2
" thrown in for good
( or is thgat bad
?
) measure
. this monster is equal parts
" 20
, 000 leagues under the sea
"
and
" the relic
,
" knows how tothe open doors like the raptors from
" jurassic park
"
and even gets to expel a half
- digested victim
( a neat effect
, admittedly
) a la the giant snake in
" anaconda
.
" some of the attack sequences are straight out of
" jaws
"
and
" alien
.
" a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of
" alien resurrection
.
" there ' s even a jet ski chase like
" hard rain
.
"
and the list goes on
. watching
" deepo rising
" ' s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself
, because none of them have well
- developed characters
, nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense ofthe fear when facing their enemy
. williams isnt affable enough
,
but his finnegan just isn ' t believable
. an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted
; pretty famke janssen
, best known as
" goldeneye
" ' s killer thighs
, is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams
, while kevin j
. o ' connor
, as finnegan ' s mechanic
, provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets ood fast
. djimon honsou
, who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december ' s
" amistad
,
" pops up in a brief part
. he needs to stay away from the water
. the movie ' s fianl shot is a groaner
, as is the 11th
- hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on
- ship saboteur
. as if a cast deserving ofthe their snack food
- fate isn ' t bad enough
( when you taunt the monster
, you ' re really asking for it
)
,
" deep rising
" is a slow
, stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot
.
annd since we all know that the heigher the casualty rate is
, the closer we are to the end of the movie
, rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn ' t out of the question
.
