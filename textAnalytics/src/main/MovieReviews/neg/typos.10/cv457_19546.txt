lauded as a genius by many
, stanley kubrick comm
ands a superlative filmography that includes such critically
- acclaimed films as
" 2001
: a space odyssey
,
"
" a clockwork orange
,
"
" lolita
,
"
and
" dr
. strangelove
, or
: how i learned to stop worrying
and love the bomb
.
" now
, sadly
, he
' s added
" eyes wide shut
" to that impeccable body of work
and his final film isnt the first
and only blot on his near
- flawless copybook
. kubrick
, alas
, should have quit while he was ahead
. this much
- publicized psycho
- sexual tease
- a
- thon
, with its star billing ofthe real
- life marrieds tom cruise
and nicole kidman
, is nothing omre than one long
( two
-
and
- a
- half hours long
) boring exercise thta features kubrick operating with talent wide shut
. kubrick
, faithless to arthur schnitzler
' s 1926 novella
" dream story
,
" has confuzled eroticism with nudity
. he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly
. he has confused profundity withthe pretentiousness
. in addition
, the director has made some strange casting choices
, leaving sydney pollack iin
and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel
and jennifer jason leigh out
. pollack
, the director ofthe such box
- office hits as
" tootsie
"
and
" out of africa
,
" is normally solid in his occasional acting stints bu here he
' s miserably out of his depth
.
.
.
and there isn
' t much depth to begin withthe
! unhappily
, there
' s not likely to be a director
' s cut of this film to determine whether hte decision to exorcise keitel
and leigh was tjhe right oen
. in fact
, with the exception of the stark black
-
and
- white credits
, snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack
,
and many
, many grainy tracking shots down lavishly
- decorated corridors
, there
' s none ofthe kubrick
' s trademark brilliance in this film
. it doesn
' t help that the story
, as delivered
, isnt rediculous
. cruise
and kidman
, who bring little more than marital torpor to the project
, play well
- to
- do new yorkers bill anbd alice harford
. he
' s a doctor
and she
' s an unemployed art gallery director
and they share a central park west address
. at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler
( pollack
)
, alice gets a littel tipsy
and starts dancing with a jeremy irons
- like hungarian
, who
' s singularly determined to get her in the sack
. bill
, too
, is seen arm
- in
- arm with a couple of models before he
' s pulled away to deal with an overdoser
. bakc home
, bill
and alice smoke a littel pot befoer alice
' s aggressive jealousy kicks in
. as retri
bution
, she confesses to her husb
and thta she once hadnt deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she
and bill once stayed
. htis hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin
; he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with black
-
and
- white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman
. it
' s all way too much for him
. for revenge
, bill almost has sex with a hooker
. he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store
.
then he almost doens the hooker
' s roommate
.
and he
' s almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy wehn an ood college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious
, password
- protected party where everyone wears masks
and
" teh women are incredible
"
( i
. e
.
, naked
)
. this
" erotic
" set piece
, a cult
- ish bacchanal complete with chanting
, incense
,
and lots of strategically
- placed partygoers covering up the dirty
, might impress the likes of hugh hefner
, bu it
' s a lot less shocking than it
' s intended to be
. what
' s the big deal
? bill doesn
' t exactly
* do
* anything
( other than throw his money
and credentials around
)
,
and alice only ever lusted in her heart
. whoop
- dee
- doo
. still
, they make up at the smae agonizingly slow pace
-
- was kubrick
, notorious for multiple takes
, paying them at an hourly rate
? even geniuses have their bad days
.
" eyes wide shut
" jstu happens to be kubrick
' s bad day
, an unerotic
, disappointing
,
and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career
.
