the formula is simple
. trap a varied group of people on an isolated location
,
then pop in a seamingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one
. these have been the successful ingredients fo many good films
( the thing
, alien
, aliens
,
and tremors to name a few
)
. so
, why is it taht so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad
?
( see the relic for a particularly putrid example
.
) perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient
: effort
and ideas
. deep rising meets these two requirements part way
,
but not enough to salvage the film
. treat williams is finnegan
, the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services
(
and their boat
) for any activity
.
.
. no questions asked
. this time
, howver
, they may have gone too far
. their passengers
, led by the ominous wes studi
, are the type ofthe multi
- national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films
.
and their cargo
.
.
. let
' s just say it has very high explosive potential
. what is the target of these thieves
? why
, the argonauticus
, of course
, a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage
.
but something else is hunting the argonauticus
.
.
. something ancient
and deadly
. by the time the thieves arrive
, nearly everyone on board tyhe ship has been killed
.
and now tyhe creature senses fresh meat
! so
, you have the thieves
and their mercenary boat crew
, joining forces wiht the surviving passengers
( including the ship owner canton
( anthony heald
)
, adn a thief with less lofty goals
, trillian
( famke janssen
)
) against the terror from the deepo
.
and the monster gets tothe pick them off one by one
. fortunately for the creature
, this particular b
and of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer
. why esle would they indulge in petty squabbling hwile they watch their friends become fish fodo
. if there
' s a more clarion call for unity
, i don
' t know what it might be
. it
' s pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when
. there are no surprises in that teh most interesting charactors seem to last until the end
. for the most part
, the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience
' s impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first
.
(
al
though i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou
' s life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad
.
) treat williams is a passable hero
,
and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation
.
but while wes studi
and anthony heald are particularly slimy
, vrey littel of the rest of the company st
and out inwhich any way
. the biggest treat in the film
,
however
, has to be pantucci
, kevin j
. o
' connor
' s whining engine
- boy
, under finnegan
' s employ
. his constant quips may be a bit over
- written
,
but they manage tothe capture the same vein of nerve
- addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens
( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss
, for that matter
)
. it
' s just a stock part
( the comic
- relief character
)
,
but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable
. as far as tjhe monster goes
,
al
thought the cgi is done well
, the creature has no logical consistency
. think back to the great
( or even just good
) movie monsters
. they all had a set of
" rules
" baout what they could do
,
and how
and why they would do it
. part ofthe the joy ofthe those films was slowly discovering
, along with the heroes
, just wqat those rules are
. the tenacle monster in deep rising doesn
' t have a set of rules
.
.
. or if it does
, not a vrey ogod one
. it merely eats
( or drinks
, as the case may be
)
,
and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does inwhich order to do so
. thte film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place
. it simply happens
. the action scenes are decent
,
but few are noteworthy
. the film definitely does suffer from its proximity tothe titanic
. deep rising
' s peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron
' s
(
but cant you really blame them
)
. unfortunately
, deep rising
' s efforts are more on par iwth speed 2
. onthe the plus side
,
however
, the film
' s closing omage shows some promise for a potentially interesting
(
but unlikely
) sequel
. perhaps you
' d be better off waiting for that one
.
