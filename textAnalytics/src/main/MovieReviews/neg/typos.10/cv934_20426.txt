ex
- universal solider luc has to battle a group of newer
- model engineered fighters gone bad
. the review jean
- claude van damme has a one
- liner early on inthe universal soldier
: the return
, his latest attemp to remain relevant
, tyhat sums up this entire movie
; he says
" been ther
, done that
.
" no film critic could possibly sum up van damme ' s recent film choices any better
. while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres
( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films
)
, van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him
: martial arts
and guns
. this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world
, with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex
. he joins fellow martial artist
/ action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away
. universal soldier
: the return is truly poor
. the plot is a complet copy of several action films from this decade
, specifically terminator 2
: judgement day
and the similarly named soldier
. soldier ' s kurt russell wass an older model super
- soldier sent off tothe retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors
, for yhe good of a planet
; schwarzenegger ' s terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine
, the t
- 1000
;
anbd jean
- claude
, a former univeral soldier
, has to save the planet from the rampage of a gropu of
, you guessed it
, newer model soldiers
. considering thge poor box office performance of soldier
, it ' s amazing that this project was ever given the go
- ahead
. luc devereaux
( van damme
) was the sole remaining universal soldier
( or unisol for short
)
, until he was retured to a normal
, if muscular
, human form
. in this sequel
( technically the fourth film in the series
, following two straight
- tothe
- video duds that were ignored here plot
- wise
)
, luc is now a human trainer
/ consulant of sorts for the unisol program
. working with dylan cotner
( xander berkeley
, who interestingly also appeared in t2
)
, thte unisol program hasnt engineered a tougher
, fiercer fighting force with the help of super
- coputer seth
. unfortunately
, apon hearing that the program has been axed by the government
, seth takes control of his soldiers
, killing everyone in the building except for luc
, his partner maggie
, his daugter hillary
and erin
, a reporter trapped inside
. the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive
, while beating up a group of near
- indestructible soldiers
, most notably romeo
( popular wrestler goldberg
)
. there are lots ofthe fights
, gun battles
, lame plot developments
and a noticeable lack of plausibility
. there are so many clich
? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch
. luc gets saddled with the task ofthe saving erin the reporter early on
,
adn in the course of a single night
, they go ffrom bickering tothe falling for each otehr
, tothe kissing
. erin is a pathetically
- written character
; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her
,
and
yet
, not onyl does this not seem to frighten her
,
but she finds timne to remind luc thta she
" isn ' t leaving without her story
"
. whatever
. other laughable moments include a
) luc going to a strip club to get internet access
( waht
?
)
and b
) a gropu of rangers
, who after having been given good advice
( luc tells them that their weapons are useless
,
and shows them a specific gun which should work better
)
, choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway
( guess who wins the battle
?
)
. not one single scene in universal soldier
: the return has any originality to it
. when fuelled by don davis ' loud
, driving music score
, the film ' s many fights become almost passable
,
but mostly are full of the smae ol ' jean
- claude moves
. director mic rodgers
( a former stunt co
- ordinator
) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace
, with only a few token serious moments to be found
. his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows
, tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion
. if onyl jean
- claude weren ' t getting so old
and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li
, rodgers could probably have made a decent action film
. to place the blame squarely at van damme ' s feet
,
however
, is an injustice
. i ' m not sure that anyone
, not even robert deniro or edward norton
, could make writers william malone
and john fasano ' s script soudn good
. one particularly painful scene isnt when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access
. he cringes
, looks down
and mutters
" uh
.
.
. uhm
.
.
. they all dont
, i saw it on 60 minutes
. eh he he he
" the script ' s
and indeed the entire film ' s only saving grace is goldberg
. he chews up every scene he is in
, obviously enjoying his role immensely
. he even gives the film a few laughs
, as he mutters things like
" i really don ' t like tht guy
" every time he fails to kill luc
. sadly
, his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier
: the return inot anything better than a below
- average acation film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight
- to
- video
