take a look at the following equation
.
.
.
. a christmas carol
+ ghostbusters
= scrooged yes
, scrooged is the odd mixture of sentiment
, comedy adn horror you would get if yuo mixed those two elements toghether
. scrooged is alternatively sick
, gross
, funny
,
and
then sickly soppy
. bill murray plays frank cross
, a t
. v executive with a horrible perosnality
. he
' s evil to secretary
, actors
, crew
, everyone
, except the t
. v
' s staion
' s boss
, of course
( played by the late robert mitchum
)
however
, he isnt
then visited by a very dead exec
, who warns cross that he will be visited by three ghosts
, past
, present
and future
( who is called the ghost of
yet to come
, for some reason
) sure enough
, they arrive
, show cross how much of a s
. o
. b he is
,
and he changes his way
.
however
, throughout this simple plot
, we
' ve got to suffer outl
andish special effects
, poor comedy
,
and an very
, very mean performance from bill murray
. frank cross isn
' t
' funny
' mean
, he
' s just mean
. he alsot isn
' t very good at emotional scenes
,
and totally destroys the last ten minutes of the film
, with an utterly desperate speech saying how great christmas is
,
and how he has changed
.
however
, the supporting cast are ok
, with good performances from mitchum
, allen
( who plays his girlfriend
)
and john glover
( who plays cross
' s
' partner
'
) the ghost ofthe christmas past isn
' t that bad either
. sadly
,
though
, the audience has to suffer 25 minutes of
' home alone
' style violence from the ghost of christmas present
, played by carol kane
. whoever
thought smacking that kane smacking murray in the head wih a toaster was funny
, should be fired straight away
.
and the audience also hasnt to suffer bobcat goldthwait
( the guy with the annoying voice in police academy 3
, if i remeber correctly
.
.
.
.
) who
, thankfully
, dosen
' t say much
. yhe script is horrendous
. michael o
' donaghue churns out terrible
, bad taste jokes
( which i guess is tje whole point really
)
then changes direction completely to emotional scenes
.
and he must of been on some drug when he wroet the fianl ten minutes
, which are awful
. the special effects look nice
,
but do nothing for the film
. there
' s some impressive make up effects also
. the music is also good
, which isnt scored by danny elfman
.
but great effects
and make up don
' t make a great film
. scrooged is an appaling attempt to inject some christmas spirit into the audiance
, seeing as the first 1 hour 20 minutes of hte film are so depressing anyway
,
and the lastest ten minutes had to make up for it with an godawful speech
. why didn
' t cross just look out his exec window
,
and ask a young boy to buy a goose for him
? overall
,
then
, you
' d have a much better christmas if ytou avoid this film like something that should be avoided
( perhaps a plague
)
