i
' ve alwyas been a kevin kline fan
, silverado
, fish called w
anda
, pirates of penzance
,
and even his hamlet on pbs
' great performances
. the minute i saw the trailer for htis film
, i resolved to see it
. besides the fact that kline starred
, it looked like a hilarious film
. i got sucker punched by tyhe trailer to an extent
, howver
, as i also
thought
,
" wow
, if there
' s this much funny stuff in tghe trailer
, there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film
.
"
( oops
) i packed up the wife
and headed to les cinemas del diablo
( my name for our local multi
- multi
- plex
.
) the film began
.
.
.
. the film concerns an english
/ drama teacher at a suburban high school
, named howard brackett
. he loves poetry anbd great literary works
,
but his class is more interested in his famous former student
, played by matt dillon
.
( i
' d put in his name
,
but my wife won
' t let me take notes during a movie anbd i
' ve forgotten it
.
) tehy continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him
. brackett has been engaged to another teacher
( played by joan cusack
) for three years
,
and has finally gotten up tghe gumption to marry her
. the wedding
,
however
, becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his sasy during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual
. kline spends most ofthe the first two
- thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn
' t
. the whole town begins to examine eveyr detail of his life
and beigns to indentifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference
. his closest friends don
' t help matters
, bringing nothing
but barbara streis
and laserdiscs tothe his stag party
. there are some genuinely hilarous moments
, oney involving a tape geared towards helping men assert theri masculinity
. kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck
, who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out
, while at tyhe same time doing his best to exploit tyhe situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations
. the movie moves along fine
and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding
. kline st
ands at the altar
and is asked to take his vows
.
.
. if you want to be surprised
, don
' t read
, i am going to reveal the ending
.
.
.
. instead of saying
" i do
" in front of his parents
and most of the town
,
and even some cameras
, he says
" i
' m gay
.
" this is where the movie
, in my opinion falls apart
. most of the humor in the film had come from kline
' s insistence that he was straight
, while at the same time
, loving poetry
and being a senstivie guy
, dressing well
,
and occaisionally acting prissy
. it reminded me ofthe the
" effeminate heterosexual
" sketch from saturday night live
. it was funny
, it ws sustainably funny
,
and kline
' s performance made it doubly so
.
however
, after the wedding
, the film drags on
. they should have attemted to come to a quick conclusion
,
but it
then gets into the serious side of waht he
' s done
. he reconciles with his parents
and his friends
, some of which had turned on him
. there are several scenes which seemed liuke a waste of time
, the scene with his mother
and her friends
, which was hilarious
, seemed pointless
, anbd the scene with tom selleck infront the bar with joan seemed pointless
. finally
, even
though i am not catholic
, i found the scene iwth the priest to be condescending
. the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years
and had not consumated tje relationship
, proclaiming to brackett in the third person
,
" he
' s gay
.
" it got a chuckle from the audience
,
but i was distracted by it
,
and began to tire of the film
. by the time the wedding had come
and gone
, i found myself hoping it would be over soon
.
( much like tihs review you are saying
) overall
, if i have to quantify it
, i say
, rising action gets
*
*
*
*
and climax
and falling action gets
. see it in economy time
.
