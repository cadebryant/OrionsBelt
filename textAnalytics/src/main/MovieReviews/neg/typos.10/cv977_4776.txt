i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy
. boy was i in forthe a christmas dissapointment
! after an hour of the movie
, i was ready to change rooms
- into anyother theater
! read on to see what i have to say
.
.
.
. four rooms
: starring
: tim roth
, jennifer beals
, antonio banderas
, quentin tarantino
, valeria golino
, madonna
, bruce willis
, marisa tomei
, alicia witt
, lili taylor
,
and ione skye
. possible stars
)
" four rooms
" was supposed tothe be one of the biggest hits of the year
. key owrd here
:
" supposed
.
" four of the biggest directors in hollywood
: quentin tarantino
, robert rodriguez
, alexander rockwell
,
and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big
and populer cast
. i guess it was all just too much because this turned outloud to be the biggest flop of the year
and it could of been great
. the plot
: it ' s new years eve
annd it ' s a bellboy ' s first day on the job
. he encounters many mysterious
and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems
. tarantino told his directors this plot
,
and each of them wrote a script
. it turned out each of them had written a dark comedy
. anders wrote
and directed the tale about a coven of witches
( madonna
, valeria golino
, alicia witt
,
and ione skye
)
, which was the worst one out of all of them
. the second room
( jennifer beals
) ws better
,
but lacking in plot
. this room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife
. the third room
( antonio banderas
) was the best roomm
, about twpo rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite
. the final one
( tarantino
, willis
) wass about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someone ' s finger
. tghe movie was just plain trash
. there was nothing here that even makes up a quality film
. it was not funny
,
and i didn ' t hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film
. tim roth is horrible as the bumbling
and mumbling bellboy
,
and he ruins every joke in the film
. the supporting cast loses meaning to the word support
and the only mentionable actors
/ actresses are antonio banderas
and jennifer beals
. marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role
. this movie is the worst film of the year
and the film could have been great
, perhaps like a more upbeat
" plaza suite
,
"
but it wasn ' t
. as trashy as it was
, some people will call it classic
. dont you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna ' s chest showing a classic film
? look for more of ken ' s kritic korner coming soon

" made number 1 on my top ten worst list of 1995
