i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy
. boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment
! after an hour ofthe the movie
, i ws ready to change rooms
- into another theater
! read on to see what i have to say
.
.
.
. four rooms
: starring
: tim roth
, jennifer beals
, antonio b
anderas
, quentin tarantino
, valeria golino
, madonna
, bruce willis
, marisa tomei
, alicia witt
, lili taylor
,
and ione skye
. possible stars
)
" four rooms
" was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year
. key word here
:
" supposed
.
" four of the biggest directors in hollywood
: quentin tarantino
, robert rodriguez
, alex
ander rockwell
,
and alison
anders were all directing one big film with a big
and popular cast
. i guess it wass all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year annd it could of been great
. the plot
: it
' s new years eve
and it
' s a bellboy
' s first day on the job
. he encounters many mysterious
and kinky hotel guests as he tries to h
andle all his own problems
. tarantino told his directors this plot
,
and each of them wrote a script
. it turned out each of them had written a dark comedy
.
anders wrote
and directed the tale about a coven of witches
( madonna
, valeria golino
, alicia witt
,
and ione skye
)
, which was the worst one out of all of them
. the second room
( jennifer beals
) wass better
,
but lacking in plot
. this room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife
. the third room
( antonio b
anderas
) was the best roomm
, about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite
. the final one
( tarantino
, willis
) was about a movie star wanting the bellboy tothe chop off someone
' s finger
. the movie was jsut plain trash
. ther was nothing here that even makes uv a quality film
. it ws not funny
,
and i didn
' t hear one laugh in the theather througout the whole film
. tim roth is horrible as the bumbling
and mumbling bellboy
,
and he ruins every joke in the film
. the supporting casted loses meaning to the word support
and the only mentionable actors
/ actresses are antonio b
anderas
and jennifer beals
. marisa tomei appears inaddition a stupid cameo role
. this movei is the worst film of the year
and the film could have beeen great
, perhaps like a more upbeat
" plaza suite
,
"
but it wasn
' t
. as trashy as it was
, some people will call it classic
. do you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna
' s chest showing a classic film
? look for more of ken
' s kritic korner coming soon
