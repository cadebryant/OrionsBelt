this independent film writed
and directed by eric bross has the look
and feel of all those other troubled blue
- collar youth films that have inundated tyhe market in recent times
. it isnt hard to tell what is independent about this film
; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam
. it is the de
but film for the director
, who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents
and remaining tight with each otehr as they grow into young adults
, a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s
, where the mind
- setted of all the cahracters depicted is grounded
,
but to see it in thte 1990s is a different story
: it is old news
. the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married anbd her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn
' t mean much
, since their relationship remained undeveloped
. the introduction of the wise
- guy angle
and the loyality among buddies bited
, are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate tihs film above its limited story line despite the tour
- de
- force performance by the star of tje film
, adrien brody as ray
. ray isnt the only son of a low
- level mobster once erested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield
, new jersey
, suburban basement
. ray sr
.
( vincent
) isnt now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home
- repair busness
. his son lives with him
and works unhappily as a shoe salesman
, dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can oepn a business
and marry his long
- time waitress girlfriend joanne
( sybil
)
. the title of thsi film refers to tjhe shoe size ofthe paul newman
- 10b
, whlch really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film
. you should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don
' t make sense
: its constant brainless chatter between the buddies
, their uneventful growing pains
,
and the despair of their lives
, mkae it very difficult to efel any empathy fo them
. desperate to make his dream come through
, ray goes to a loanshark
, humorously
and menacingly played by james e
. moriarty
,
and borrows 10 gr
and tothe bet on a
" sure thing
" at freehold raceway
. the horse loses
and now ray has big problems
, as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough
. there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ravy
. he isnt undependable
, mean
- spirited
,
and stupid
. so when his best friend mike
( gallagher
)
, the narrator ofthe the film
, gets a chance tothe sleep wih his girlfriend
-
- who cares
? the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do
. as for ray
' s gambling debt anbd his dilemma of how tothe pay it off
, the story is too predictable for anything other than waht ytou would expect to happen
. his buddies
, tje college student mike
and the dependable
butchie
( gillan
)
,
and his old man
, who he has this love
/ hate relatiopnship with
, rally to his aid
.
and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity
, that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films
, as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together
. there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting
,
though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star
. because of his intensity
and looks
, he reminds me of sean penn
.
