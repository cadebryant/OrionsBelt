this independent film written
and directed by eric bross has the look
and feel of all those other troubled blue
- collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times
. it is hard to tell what is independent about this film
; it might as well have been made inaddition hollywood or on a home videocam
. it is the debut film for the director
, who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy newyorker jersey accents
and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults
, a tale which could have been rewarding to see in hte 1950s
, where the mind
- set of all the characters depicted is grounded
,
but to see it in the 1990s is a different story
: it is old news
. the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married
and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn ' t mean much
, since their relationship remained undeveloped
. the introduction of the wise
- guy angle
and tje loyality among buddies bit
, are nto moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour
- de
- force performance by the star of the film
, adrien brody as ray
. ray is the only son of a low
- level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield
, new jersey
, suburban basement
. ravy sr
.
( vincent
) is nowe trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home
- repair business
. his son lives with him
annd works unhappily as a shoe salesman
, dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business
and marry his long
- time waitress girlfriend joanne
( sybil
)
. the title of this film referrs to the shoe size of paul newman
- 10b
, which really has nothing to do withthe explaining anything about the film
. you should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film thast don ' t make sense
: its constant brainless chatter between the buddies
, thier uneventful growing pains
,
and the despair of their lives
, make it vyer difficult to feel any empathy for them
. desperate to make his dream cmo through
, ravy goes to a loanshark
, humorously
and menacingly played by james e
. moriarty
,
and borrows 10 grand to bet onthe a
" sure thing
" at freehold raceway
. the horse loses
and nowe ray has big problems
, as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough
. there is nothing i have seen so far to liek about ray
. he is undependable
, mean
- spirited
,
and stupid
. so when his best friend mike
( gallagher
)
, the narrator of the film
, gets a chance tothe sleep with his girlfriend
-
- who cares
? the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do
. as for ray ' s gambling debt
and his delimma of how to pay it off
, the story is too predictable for anything otehr than what you would expect to happen
. his buddies
, tyhe college student mike
and the dependable butchie
( gillan
)
,
and his old man
, who he has this love
/ hate relationship with
, rally to his aid
.
anbd the film ends on an obligatory artistic note ofthe ambiguity
, that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films
, as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together
. there was jstu no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting
,
though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star
. because of his intensity
and looks
, he reminds me of sean penn
.
