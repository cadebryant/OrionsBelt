godzilla is a nuclear freak
. he is a lizard that has been mutated over the years
and has become a new species
, one that has a foot as long as this bus
,
and a claw as long as this sign
. this aquatic creature made its first attack in the pacific isl
ands
. he tore up a ship that carried dozens of japanese men
. one survivied
. onyl he was left to recount the terror that he had seen
. he was merely able to repeat the words
" godzilla
.
.
. godzilla
.
.
. godzilla
"
. the film
then introduces us to matthew broderick
, a biologist who has been studing the fascinating growth of chernobyl earthworms
.
" they

% larger than they used to be

" he proclaims

. s
. military pulls him off this three year project annd assigns him to figure out what godzilla is
.

. i hate to use such a word in a review
, something that is supposed to inform my audience
,
but i really need to drive this one home

. it is unbelieveable to me how the producers of this movie saw the final cut
and said
,
" ok
! it
' s great
! let
' s show this puppy
.
" rol
and emmerich needs a good horse whipping
. his latest piece ofthe trash makes id4 look like a masterpiece ofthe modern american cinema
.
and if steven spielberg had never made the jurassic park films
, emmerich
and his team of talent
- challenged imbeciles would never have had a clue as tothe how the creature should look
. let me give you a few examples of this terrible attempt at filmmaking
. i plan on giving smoe things away here
. belive me
, godzilla holds no surprises for anyone with an iq heigher than their shoe size
, so
.
.
. no worries
. howver
, if you are looking for that
" firt time thrill
"
and you refuse to let me do you this favor
, by all means
, stop reading now

) the mayor of new york city is a heavy set individual with parted gray hair
and thick glasses
. his name is mayor ebert

. i couldn
' t make this up if i tried

( which look more liuke jurassic park raptors than the jurassic park raptors
.
) d
.
) the u
. s
. military
, upon relization that godzilla has disappeared after running rampant through the city
, decides that he
" might be hiding in a building
.
" e
.
)
( oh yeah

.
) godzilla strikes at manhattan
. manhattan
, an isl
and approximately tje size of san francisco holds three million people
. they evactuate to new jersey inwhich about one day
. no problem
. f
.
) early on
, they bait godzilla with fish
.
( he likes fish
, you know
.
) the thing is on an isl
and
. the atlantic ocean is three steps east
,
but pile a whole bunch of grouper on fifth
and 57th
.
.
. oh he
' s gonna come running
. g
.
) you know what
? i
' ll stpo with the list now
.
.
. the alphabet isn
' t big enough anyway
. the dialogue makes me wonder if producer dean devlin had his five year old do a re
- write
.
" the kid is good
!
" he must have said
. maria pitillo is looking to become a name inaddition hollywood by starring in this potential blockbuster
. bad move
, maria
. acting doesn
' t get much worse than her turn as broderick
' s ex
- flame
. matthew broderick is a good actor
,
but you
' d never give him a chance if godzilla were the only film of his you
' d seen
. jean reno needs to pik his american films a bit more carefully
. at times
, godzilla seems to be headed toward a zucker
, abrahams
, zucker film
.
( airplane
!
, naked gun
.
) the jokes are indeed thyat bad
. bu just when you think the filmmakers are having funn with ytou
, htey take themselves seriously
. how dabree they
! godzilla would have been better if it had only thrown in visual sight gags
and fart jokes
. at least
then we would know we were supposed to laugh
. each
and every character in godzilla is beyond stupid
and i was really pulling for the beast to kill more of them
. emmerich did do one thing
,
though
.
(
and i
' ve no idae if it was intentional
.
) he made me sympathize with godzilla
. his attackers weere so damn dumb that i felt sorry fo him being pelted with bullets
and missles
.
but what made me feel even sorrier for him was tyhat his famous name will alwyas be attatched to one of the worst films hollywood has ever produced
.
