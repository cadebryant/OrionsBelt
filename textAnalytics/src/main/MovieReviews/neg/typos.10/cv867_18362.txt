whenever u
. s
. government starts meddling into other counries
' affairs
, under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political
, religious or ethnic persecution
, yhe other side is ready to use mantra that says
" look who
' s talking
! what have you done tothe tje indians
?
"
however
, even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history wehn it suits theri purposes
. hollywood is just another example
, with its revisionist westerns
, made in early 1990s
. those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness
, coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus
' discovery of america
. one of such examples is geronimo
: an american legend
, 1993 western directed by walter hill
, film thgat deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives
and white settlers
. the hero of the film is geronimo
( played by wes studi
)
, leader of apaches
, fierce warrior tribe that used tothe give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century
. when the movie begins
, in 1885
, geronimo
and his apaches made peace with u
. s
. government
and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation
.
however
, broken promises
, injustice annd violence against his people would make geronimo restless
. with not omre 30 or so of his followers
, he escapes reservation
and begins guerrilla campaign
. general crook
( gene hackman
)
, comm
ander of u
. s
. army forces
, respects geronimo
and knows that even his 5
, 000 force isn
' t enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest
. instead
, he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches
- lt
. charles gatewood
( jason patric
)
and indian hunter al sieber
( robert duvall
)
. together with young lt
. britton davis
( matt damon
) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo
. geronimo
: an american legend
, liuke many movies made under the shadow of political correctness
, try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities
,
but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors
. so
, yhe stroy about geronimo is told from tje prespective of his enemies
. almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers
and use every oppertunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him
and his people
.
al
though such elements of john millius
' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history
, they harm the story of geronimo
. to be honest
, walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film
,
but the movie segments that deal whith the plight of apaches
and the uprising are given too little time
. instead
, they turn out to be nothing more than tghe back story for rather uninteresting adventure stry of gatewood
and his b
and
. to make even worse
, hill has some real problems with pacing
and style
, anbd in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one
- story about geronimo
and story baout his pursuers
. the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo
' s life before
and after his last uprising
, in many ways more intresting than the story about gatewood
. the diference between those segments could be observed through the different quaity of acting
. wes studi
, cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the lastest of the mohicans
, was perfect choice for geronimo
, not only because he resembles geronimo
,
but because he induces a lot of passion in his role
. contrary tothe him
, we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies
. while this could be expected from someone like jason patric
, it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall
. even hill
' s directing is bellow expectations
- battle scenes are too short
and
, like in many of his late films
, force viewers to ask what had happened to tyhe great action director of 1970s
. even his old associate
, music composer ry cooder
, disappoints
, withthe the scoer that shifts between indian motives
and classic
. on the other h
and
, photography by lloyd ahern ii
, with the uise of red lenses
, gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere
, ideal for this movie thta was supposed to be melancholic epic
. all inspite all
, compaired with some of the hollywood
' s examples of political correctness
, this film isn
' t so bad
,
but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better
.
