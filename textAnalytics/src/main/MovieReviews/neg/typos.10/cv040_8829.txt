lenghty
and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama the english patient
. great acting
, music
and cinematography were nice
,
but too many dull sub
- plots
and characters made the film hard to followup
. ralph fiennes
( strange days
, schindler
' s list
) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy
, a victim ofthe amnesia
and horrible burns after world war ii infact italy
. the stoyr revolves around his past
, in flashback form
, making it even more confusing
. anyway
, he is taken in by hana
( juliette binoche
, the horseman on the roof
)
, a boring war
- torn nurse
. she was never really made into anytying
, until she met an indian towards the end
, developing
yet another sub
- plot
. count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger
( willem dafoe
, basquiat
)
. his love
( kirstin scott thomas
, mission impossible
) was severely injured in a plane crash
,
and eventually died in a cave
. he returned tothe find her dead
and was heart
- broken
. so he flew her dead body somewhere
,
but was shot down from the ground
. don
' t get the wrong idea
, it may soudn good
and the trailer may be tempting
,
but good is the last thing this film is
. maybe if it weere an hour less
, it may have been tolerable
,
but 2 hours
and 40 minutes of talking is too much to h
andle
. the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes
and dafoe
and the beautiful dezert cinematography
. other than these
, the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom
and wastes entirely too much film
.
