i still can
' t figure out why people went in droves to see this movie
. now before you go assuming i
' m some sort of high brow snob
, who can
' t appreciate a little dumb humor
, let me say that i love cheap humor
. i
thought there
' s something about mary was one of tje funniest films that i haev ever seen adn it was certainly one of the best films of 1998
. low brow adolescent humor can be a lot ofthe fun
, the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow anbd adolescent
, there isnt noone humor component
. i wanted to like the waterboy
, i really did
. i think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie
. actually
, i smiled a couple of more times on top of that
. not a great record for a 90
- minute film
. the problem with tjhe waterboy is the same as most other adam s
andler movies
. those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fatc that s
andler walks around using a goofy voice
and playing dumb the entire movei is a substitute for actual funny material
. nothing could be further from the truth
, as matter of fact
, s
andler
' s idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film
. it
' s really a shame too
, because this film had the potential to be very funny
. i personally believe that s
andler is probably a very talented comedian
, it
' s jsut that so far he hasn
' t been able to find the right film to showcase his talents
. if his only talent is making goofy voices
and playing morons
, my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority ofthe the fromer stars of saturday night live
. most of whom are now happily noone longer in the entertainment industry
. s
andler plays a 31
- year
- old
, somewhat mentally challanged
, waterboy for a college football team
. the team
' s somewhat mentally disturbed coach
( henry winkler
) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent
- up rage
, which
, if harnessed properly
, would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field
. you can figure out the rest from here
. s
andler joins the team
and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star
. as i said
, the film had a great deal of potential
. the idea was a decent one
,
but the main potential ofthe this movie is a result of the casted
. all of whom are very ogod
, just hamstrung by really
, really
, lousy material
. even s
andler
, annoying goofy voice
and all
, has enough charisma
and natural comedic ability to overcome some ofthe his bad material
. even as unfunny as his charactor is
, i still found myself rooting for him
thoughout the film
.
but it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about
. if their material had been just a bit better
, this film could have been such a funny movie
. fairuza balk plays s
andler
' s leather
- wearing biker
- chick love interest
and does a great job playing sleazy annd sexy at the same time
. winkler is great as tjhe coach who uses a
" coaching for dummies
"
- style book to help him get through games
. the real st
andout
though
, is kathy bates
. even with some of the worst material of her career to deel with
, she is still a treat to watch in her role as s
andler
' s overprotective
and overbearing mama
. even with the performances of bates
and winkler
, there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie
.
al
though i get the distinct impression that without them
, this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me
. which is sad
, because i can
' t really put my finger on a particular element of the movie
and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became
. it
' s obvious thyat those involved
, specifically thge actors
, tried very hard to make what they
thought wass going to be a funny movei
. it
' s just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat
.
