my giant begins with a monologue that

and a distinctive

? 90s feel
. i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was
, with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy
( billy crystal
) is visiting a client annd in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream
.
and when sammy meets max
, his giant
, mysterious savior plyed by gheorghe muresan
, there is magic in the air
; albeit it a bit goofy
, i loved every minute of it
. the film
, of course
, plays on the size difference vetween tghe two
,
and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects
. i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max
- sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table
and eat from oversized bowls
and spoons
. i alsot liked jere burns
'
( from tv
' s
` something so right
'
) performance as the director of the film in romania
. at this point
, the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan isnt incredibly hard tothe underst
and
, particularly during his fast
- paced first scene
. it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate
, as i did underst
and him more as the film continued
and i became accustomed to his speech
.
however
, about the time muresan becomes coherent
, tghe charachters head to new york anbd tjhe film takes a dive
. off teh high board
. suddenly
, we are expected tothe beleve sammy is a do
- whatever
- it
- tkaes slime ball
. up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure
,
but he didn
' t come off as a desperate jerk
. if he hadnt
, the first scenes coudl never have been so lighthearted
and magical
. bu now
, in newyorker york
, we are further itnroduced to his neglected wife
and son
,
and his character is despeate enough to envolve max in a disturbing giant vs
. midgets wrestling match
, which i found quite unpleasant
and jarring within the framework of yhe film
. indeed
, many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces
. tihs includes the scenes featuring steven seagal
, when sammy gets max a role in a big
, hollywood movei filming in las vegas
. while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself
, tyhe scenes appeared tothe exist solely because of his participation
, rather than because the film dem
anded it
.
and thte audience is required to take a huge leap to bleieve that max would win the role based onthe his quotations ofthe shakespeare
. at this point i found myself thinking
,
` we
' re supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film
?
'
then i realized he was
,
and i was watching it
. in the fianl third
, the film undergoes another transformation
, this time tothe unbridled sentimentality
. note
: major plot points are revealed in this
and the final paragraph
. max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love
, lillianna
, who hasn
' t seen him usance he was a normal
- sized kid
. her refusal tothe see max
( unbeknownst to him
) leads us to an awkward
` ends justify the means
' scene as sammy
' s wife serena
, played nicely by kathleen quinlan
, poses as lillianna
. i found this scene offensive
. not only did it rely on deception to induce warm
, fuzzy feelings fomr the audience
, it reduced max to someone we should pity
and coddle
, which i
thought was quite undeserved
. i think max could have h
andled the truth
, gratuitous illness anbd all
. late in the film we learn max
,
and in fact all giants
, have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably
. this could be an enlightening revelation
,
but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy
' s transformation into a caring
, sensitive guy
-
- adn hey
, a great dad
and husb
and
, too
!
` my giant
' suffers from a poorly constructed story line
and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rether than their own internal persuasions
. a stronger story with mroe room for character growth might have been possible if the focus wass on max
' s struggle to be accepted
and cast inaddition movies instead of sammy
' s struggles to get money
and become a better person
. inaddition this senaireo
, max
' s illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator
. sentiment
and emotion would haev followed naturaly
. instead
, we
' re apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end
,
but we
' re not allowed to focus on max
. crystal
and muresan give adequate
and at times enjoyable performances
,
but in the end
,
` my giant
' left me feeling like i
' d been fed gruel from a giant spoon
.
