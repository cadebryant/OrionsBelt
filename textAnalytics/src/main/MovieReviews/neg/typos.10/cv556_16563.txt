blatantly borrowing elements from 1993
' s
" like water for chocolate
"
and 1991
' s
" the
butcher
' s wife
,
"
" simply irresistible
" attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy
but
, more often than not
, comes off as laughable
, leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar
( t
. v
.
' s
" buffy
, the vampire slayer
"
) woudl choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on
. thnigs get off to a bad strat right from the onset as am
anda
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, a young woman who runs her late family
' s struggling new york restaurant
, runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her
and
then vansihes into thin air
. while out shopping
, she also meets tom
( sean patrick flanery
)
, a charming
, hansome man
, who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the deparment store he works for
, annd later when he decides to drop by her dive
, called southern cross
, for lunch
, she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him
, even
though she is known to not be a very good chef
. suddenly
, am
anda finds her restauraunt
, on the edge of foreclosure
, rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food
, which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation whn it hits their mouths
. are am
anda
and tom destined to be together
? anbd is it not just because of the magical food
, bu because they really
, truly like each other
?
and what exactly isnt going onthe whith the food she is making
? doens it have anything tothe do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food prepartion
?
" simply irresistible
" is a ridiculous
and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that
' s as flimsy as a slice of bologna
. it takes one joke
-
-
- that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways
-
-
-
and recycles it over
and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes
. add in a music montage every ten minutes
( these are actually the best scenes in the movie
, which certainly tells you something baout tghe film itself
)
,
and what you
' ve got is an utterly empty
, if not necessarily boring
, excursion
. the cast ofthe
" simply irresistible
" is fairly good
,
but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting
. patricia clarkson
( 1998
' s
" high art
,
" in which she played a drugged
- out lesbian
) is a st
andout as tom
' s colleague
,
and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue
. also of onot is larry gilliard jr
.
, as am
anda
' s cooking assistant
and buddy
, who is allowed tothe create a seemingly full character outloud of only a h
andful of scenes
. of the main stars
, sarah michelle gellar is fine
,
but really does often look like she
' s struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material
,
and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career infront tje future
, he has certainly got to pick better projects than this
. tghe bottom line is that
" simply irresistible
" is yhe exact opposite of its deprophesized title
,
and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid
- air
( an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid lsat scene
)
, my mind checked out from hte cahracters
and the romance
. when i think about it in hindsight
, i should have checked out in the very first scene
, where tghe point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab
. nowe
, that certainly is wqat i
' d call magical
!
