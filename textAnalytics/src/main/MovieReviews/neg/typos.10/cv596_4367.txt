i
' ve got to admit it
.
.
. i
' m a huge jim carrey fan
. i loved the frist ace ventura
, as well as the mask
and dumb
and dumber
-
-
and even in batman forever
( which was a pretty awful movie
)
, carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good
. until i saw ace ventura 2
, i had no idae how people could find the guy annoying
. sadly
, ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating
and annoying carrey can be
. carrey goes through tje same schtick he went through in the first ace movei
, bu this time it is no longer funny
-
- it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i
. the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon
( infront a reasonable cliffhanger spoof
)
. soon he is called out of retirement tothe fidn a bat which was kidnapped anbd
, if not returned in four days
, will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other
. once again
, it
' s up tothe ace to save the day
, using his uncanny detective skills
. those who have been disappointed by carrey
' s more restrained roles in the films following the firt ace ventura may be glad to see him over
- acting to the best of his ability
,
but some may be disappointed by the fact that htis sequel doesn
' t capture the feel of the original
. the original benefited from what looked tothe be carrey
' s constant hyped
- up improv sequences
, which were hysterically funny
. here
,
however
, the tighter script
( whlch is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies
) takes the improvised material from the first
,
and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie
, giving carrey little chance to improvise
. instade
, his extremly funny manner has beeen reduced to just walking around stupidly
.
but one of the biggest problems i had ws with the character of ventura himself
. in the first movei
, he was always kool
,
and one step ahead of every one else
-
- perfect for carrey
' s off
- the
- wall approach
.
but here
, ventura is made to look a lot stupider
,
and is often made out as the straight guy
-
- a role which is definitely not carrey
' s style
. there are definitely some very funny moments
,
but they are few
and far between
. they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the frist ace ventura
, or even dumb
and dumber
.
