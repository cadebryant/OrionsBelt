this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation
.
but lo
and behold
, here comes
" switchback
,
"
and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as
" kiss tghe girls
" adn
" i know what you did last summer
.
"
but
" switchback
" isnt an undoubtedly weak genre entry
, as the material it covers is old
and tired
,
and the filmmakers rarley sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting
.
" switchback
" opens with the murder of a babysitter
and the abduction of the young child she
' s watching
. we learn late iin thte game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse
( dennis quaid
)
,
and tht the kidnapper
/ killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has beeen tracking across the country for quite a while
. he is promptly removed from the case
, bu this conflict ofthe interest doesn
' t keep him from offering pursuit
. lacrosse
' s most recent trek takes him to a blood
- soaked hotel room in amarillo
, texas
, where the local sheriff
( r
. lee ermey
) is torn between his re
- election campaign
and helping his new ally catch his man
. in a realted aside
, former railway worker bob goodall
( danny glover
) is cruising through yhe snowbound west inaddition his pinup
- plastered
( even on the seatbelts
) el dorado
. along the way
, he picks up
-
-
and subsquently saves the life of
-
- hitchhiking loner lane dixon
( jared leto
)
. this tangent isn
' t a r
andom one
, as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece ofthe the puzzle or turn out to be tje killer himself
. or is the villain in fact lacrosse
, only pretending to be after the cold
- hearted murderer he knows so much about
. in a sense
, that
' s half of the basic problem with
" switchback
.
" for its first hour
, the movei presents evidence that any of theese three men could be the perpetrator
, so we
' re given little insight inot who they are
, likely for fear that we
' ll learn too much too fast
and therefore be able to make tghe proper deduction
.
but
" switchback
"
then decides tothe explicitly reveal the killer
' s identity at its midpoint
,
and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing
and the generation of suspense
. some ofthe the acting is a burdensome area as well
, propably because the performers were instructed to build personas taht are the exact opposite of their true selves
. what is danny glover doing here
, grinning
and yeehawing his way through the messy plot
?
and dennis quaid
?
( that monotone
-
- stop it
!
) ermey is solid in a supporting role that
' s more intresting tahn tyhe two leads thrown together
,
but the charismatic leto
( claire danes
' object of affection in
" my so
- called life
"
) is a scene
- stealer tried
and true
.
> from a material st
andpoint
,
" switchback
" is pretty empty
.
but even when first
- time director jeb stuart
( who wrote
" the fugitive
" adn
" die hard
"
) doesn
' t know what to do
, he knows what he wants it to look like
-
- the movie provides some great visuals
. the set
- on
- a
- turain climax looks good
( even
though thge action is illogical
)
,
and the beautiful
, crisp cinematography captures the rockies inaddition all of thier icy splendor
. still
, that
' s not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond
, annd more than the movie
' s look will end up leaving you cold
.
