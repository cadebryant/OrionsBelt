anna
and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon ' s fact based novel the king
and i
,
and it ' s big
, expensive
and soulless
.
though ogod
- looking
, its lavish sets
, fancy costumes
and luscious cinematography can do little tothe compensate for the emotional wasteland thast is peter krikes
and steve meerson ' s script
. so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting
. this is jodie foster ' s first movie since the jaw
- droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago
and it isn ' t the best choise to show off her acting chops
. she ' s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens
, the uptight
, widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam
( now thailand
) with her son to instruct the king ' s
( chow yun
- fat
) son in the ways of the west
( becasue
" the ways of england are the ways of the world
)
. the king likes her so much he puts her iin charge of educating the whole royal family
( 58 kids with 10 more in the way
; impressive
, no
?
)
. the eldest prince is none too happy about this
(
" father
, have i offended yuo in some way
? why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher
?
)
,
but soon gets to know anna
adn her stern
- mother
- who
- loves
- you personality better
and comes to like her
. meanwhile
, siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma
. the king
and his close advisors suspect that this is britain ' s doing which arouses suspicion in siam
, putting anna in an uncomfortable position
. she is not sure what to make of this
and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis
but works to diffuse the king ' s prejudices
. he
,
though self
- righteous as ever
, can ' t help
bu be influenced by the eloquent anna
and they slowly
, quietly
, develope affections for each other
. ther is a scene in the middle of anna
and teh king where one of the king ' s younger daughters dies
. it ' s your classic deathbed scene
, with the girl ' s mournful eyes staring at her father
, who tries only semi
- successfully to maintain his composure
. anna
then comes in
and cries a bit
. the sequence was there for a purpose
: to envoke a strong emotional response from the viewer
. i ' m usually a sucker for such scenes
and
yet this time
, i was just sitting there
, my emotions untouched
. this remains true through all ofthe tghe movie which remains emotionally barren
. we never develop connections to the cahracters
; never given a reason to care
. this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant
, whose last film was ever after
, noe of my favorites of 1998
. i do not doubt tennant ' s ability to put together a decent movie
,
but anna
and tyhe king
, aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically defishant
. the sets
and scenery are gorgeous
,
bu the camerawork does nothing tothe convey its grandeur
. even terrence malick managed to do more withthe flora
and fauna inaddition his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from
$ 75 million worth of props
and a shoot in malaysia
. we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of veiw
; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger
- than
- life awe
. i liked both foster
and yun
- fat
, who give entertaining if nto terribly involving performances in the two lead roles
. foster ' s generally stoic persona serves her well here
, as she is playing a reserved
, formal
and rather underdeveloped character
. yun
- fat is especially effective
, perfectly conveying the king of siam ' s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts
. what does anna
and the king inaddition is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters
and situations
. the casted is great
, the directer is talented
,
and the budget is lavish
,
but htis ill
- advised remake of the classic rogers
and hammerstein movie is unable tothe utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole
. this is an emotionless costume epic
.
