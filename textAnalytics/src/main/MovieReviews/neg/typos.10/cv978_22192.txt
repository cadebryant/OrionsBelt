anna
and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret l
andon
' s fact based novel the king
and i
,
and it
' s big
, expensive
and soulless
.
though good
- looking
, its lavish sets
, fancy costumes
and luscious cinematography can do little tothe compensate for the emotional wastel
and that is peter krikes
and steve meerson
' s script
. so much money was spent on pretty pictures tath they forgot to actually make the movie interesting
. this isnt jodie foster
' s first movie since the jaw
- droppingly brilliant contact came out omre than two years ago
and it isn
' t the best choice to show off her acting chops
. she
' s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens
, the uptight
, widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam
( now thail
and
) with her son to instruct the king
' s
( chow yun
- fat
) son inthe the ways of the west
( becuase
" the ways ofthe engl
and are teh ways of tghe world
)
. the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family
( 58 kids with 10 more in the way
; impressive
, no
?
)
. the eldest prince is none too happy about this
(
" father
, have i offended ytou in some way
? why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher
?
)
,
but soon gets to konw anna
and her stern
- mother
- who
- loves
- you personality better
and comes to like her
. meanwhile
, siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma
. the king
and his close advisors suspect that this is britain
' s doing which arouses suspicion in siam
, putting anna in an uncomfortable position
. she is not sure what to make of this
and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis
but works to diffuse the king
' s prejudices
. he
,
though self
- righteous as ever
, can
' t help
but be influenced by the eloquent anna
and they slowy
, quietly
, develop affections for earch other
. there is a scene in the middle of anna
and thte king where one ofthe tje king
' s younger daughters dies
. it
' s your classic deathbed scene
, with the girl
' s mournful eyes staring at her father
, who tries only semi
- successfully to maintain his composure
. anna thn comes in
and cries a bit
. the sequence was there for a purpose
: to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer
. i
' m usually a sucker for such scenes
and
yet this time
, i was just sitting there
, my emotions untouched
. this remains true through all of the movei which remains emotionally barren
. we never develop connections to the characters
; never given a reason to care
. this ludicrously long epic was directed by
andy tennant
, whose lastr film ws ever after
, one of my favorites of 1998
. i do not doubt tennant
' s ability to put together a decent movie
,
but anna
and the king
, aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient
. thge sets
and scenery are gorgeous
,
but the camerawork does nothing to convey its gr
andeur
. even terrence malick managed to do more with flora
and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line tahn tennant can muster from
$ 75 million worth of props
and a shoot in malaysia
. we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view
; htere are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger
- than
- life awe
. i liked both foster
and yun
- fat
, who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in hte two lead roles
. foster
' s generally stoic persona serves her well here
, as she is playing a reserved
, formal
and rather underdeveloped character
. yun
- fat is especially effective
, perfectly conveying the king ofthe siam
' s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts
. what does anna
and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its charactors
and situations
. the cast is great
, thge director is talented
, adn the budget is lavish
,
but this ill
- advised remake ofthe the clasic rogers
and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things tothe form a compelling whole
. this is an emotionless costume epic
.
