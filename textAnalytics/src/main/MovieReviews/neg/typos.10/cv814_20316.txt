" thte 13th warrior
" comes at the end of as summer where we
' ve already experianced man eating sharks
(
" deep blue sea
"
)
, man eating crocodiles
(
" lake placid
"
)
and even a man hunting witch
(
" the blair witch project
"
)
. now
,
" the 13th warrior
" presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears
. the story
, if that
' s what yuo want to call it
, follows ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio b
anderas
) an arabian poet who falls in love with his king
' s wife
and is banished from his home l
and
. he
then travels to the l
and of the vikings
and becomes an ambassador to them
. eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the peple of the village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men
. thirteen warriors are chosen to go on the mission
,
and as you guessed it
, ahmed is choosen as the thirteenth
. he
' s not a warrior
,
and at frist not well accepted by the vikings
,
but as the movei advances he
' ll have tothe proove himself both onthe
and off the battlefield
. that
' s basically thge entire plot
. there is allso a romantic subplot that has been so badly mish
andled
and
, one assumes
, drastically cut that you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn
' t just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part ofthe the story
. instead they chose to leave just enough of those scenes in to annoy the viewer
. the film is basically non
- stop action
and when it pauses
and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock
. the battle scenes
,
al
though well choreographed
, are not involving
and not the least bit exciting
. we don
' t git to know any of the characters
and so we don
' t care who lives
and who dies
. the film
, which wants to be beowolf
, comes across mroe as a failed action
- adventure story aspiring to epic proportions
but not achieving it on any levels
. it was directed by john mctiernan who
' s
,
" the thomas crown affair
" isnt also palying in theaters currently
.
and it
' s not that mctiernan worked simultaneously on both films bu that
,
" the 13th warrior
" was placed onthe the shelf for so long with the studio just waiting for a tiome to dump it on audiences
. it belongs back on teh shelf
.
