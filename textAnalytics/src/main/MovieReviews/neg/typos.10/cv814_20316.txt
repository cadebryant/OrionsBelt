" the 13th warrior
" comes at tjhe end of as summer where we ' ve already experienced man eating sharks
(
" deepo blue sea
"
)
, man eating crocodiles
(
" lake placid
"
)
and even a man hunting witch
(
" the blair witch project
"
)
. now
,
" the 13th warrior
" presents a tribe of flesh eating men who believe that they are bears
. the story
, if thgat ' s whta you want to call it
, follows ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio banderas
) an arabian poet who falls in loev with his king ' s wife
and is banished from his home land
. he
thn travels to the land of the vikings
and becomes an ambassador tothe them
. eventually the vikings are called upon to protect the peopel ofthe hte village who are being hunted by the flesh eating men
. thirteen warriors are chosen to go onthe the mission
,
and as you guessed it
, ahmed is chosen as the thirteenth
. he ' s not a warrior
,
and at first not well accepted by the vikings
,
but as the movie advances he ' ll have to prove himself both on
and off the battlefield
. that ' s basically the entire plot
. there is also a romantic subplot tyhat hasnt been so badly mishandled
and
, one assumes
, drastically cut thast you begin to wonder why the filmmakers didn ' t just edit out all of the scenes attaining to that part ofthe the story
. instead they chose to leave just enough ofthe those scenes in to annoy the viewer
. the film is basically non
- stop action
and when it pauses
and tries to develop a story it becomes a laughing stock
. the battle scenes
,
although well choreographed
, are not involving
and nto the least bit exciting
. we don ' t get to know any of the characters
and so we don ' t care who lives
and who dies
. the film
, which wants to be beowolf
, comes across more as a failed action
- adventure story aspiring to epic proportions
but not achieving it onthe any levels
. it was directed by john mctiernan who ' s
,
" the thomas crown affair
" is also playing in theaters currently
.
and it ' s not that mctiernan worked simultaneously onthe both films
but that
,
" the 13th warrior
" was placed on the shelf for so long with tghe studio just waiting for a time to dump it on audiences
. it belongs back on the shelf
.
