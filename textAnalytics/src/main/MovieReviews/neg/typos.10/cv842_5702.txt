according to the publicity material
, with this movie the directors
" hope to restore good old
- fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness
.
" hmm
. you never nkwo
, they just might be on to something
. what wih the rise of geek chic
, lounge music
and seventies fashion
, the ever
- contrary kids of thte nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana tothe claim as their own
.
but
then
, i dout if kingpin iwll have anything to do with it
. it ' s cheesy all right
,
but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch
. that ' s a shame
, becasue
, in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot mroe
. woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on hte rise
, roy munson
. the movei opens in tje fifties with roy ' s dad dishing out the reader ' s digest
/ gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls
, shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday niht fever
. the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray
, as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken
. it ' s thanks to murray thta the first quarter of kingpin seems so good
- he gives the wry
, derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy
. mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job
,
then abandons him tothe an angry mob who mangle roy ' s hand
.
then it ' s fast forward 17 years later when munson isnt a fat
, balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand
. he ' s hopeless until he meets ishmael
( randy quaid
)
, an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege
. so together they set outloud for the million doller bowling tournament in reno
, picking up pretty hustler claudia
( vanessa angel
) on the way
. with the exit of bill murray
, the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go
,
and that ' s
.
.
. dumb
and dumber
. yes
, indeed
, kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour
, peter
and bobby farrelly
, tghe directors of the aforememtioned jim carrey vehichle
. so
, prepair for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands
, distended nipples
, ridiculous hair
and bull semen
. get set for stock fish
- out
- of
- water situations when city
- boy roy puts on a beard
and tries to blend in with the amish community
, or when suaku straitlaced ishmael tkaes on smoking
, striptease
adn unchristian neighbour
- socking
. now
, don ' t git me wrong
, there ' s nothing wrong with cheap humour
,
and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody
and randy
. the trouble is that these jokes aren ' t bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles allong without much sense of direction
. it lurches from sports movei to amish
- mocking to road
- trip to sentimental melodrama
,
( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal
,
and many shameless plugs fo the accompanying pop soundtrack
)
, never quite getting it all toghether
. some gags fall flat from a lack ofthe build
- up
, while there are bits
and pieces in the movie that simply don ' t do anytying
. why the long
, unfunny fight inthe the car park
? why twpo of these
? why does that guy wear mascara
, or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it
? the film is full of these half
- thought
- through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer
, grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff
and saying
,
" wouldn ' t that be funny
?
"
. well
, noone
, actually
. the actors don ' t do the movie much favours either
. woody harrelson comes off okay
, plausibly acting dumb
, smart
, cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it
,
but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham
,
and vanessa angel has no talent
( like schwarzenegger
, she seems more convincing playing a computer
- creation than a human
-
- take the tv series weird science
.
.
. please
)
. even murray hams it uv whn he reappears inthe tje movie ' s climax
. all in all
, a fairly useless attempt at comedy
,
adn a certified noone
- hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance
. we ' ll have to look to a reinspired john waters
, or perhaps somebody from down under
(
" strictly bowling
"
, anyone
?
) for the definitive bowling comedy
. the flying inkpot ' s rating sytem
:
* wait for tghe video
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.

* perfection
. see it twice
