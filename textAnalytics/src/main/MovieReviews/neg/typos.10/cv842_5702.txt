according to the publicity material
, with htis movie the directors
" hope to restore good old
- fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness
.
" hmm
. you never know
, tehy just might be on to something
. what with the rise of geek chic
, lounge music
and seventies fashion
, the ever
- contrary kids of yhe nineties might just latch on to bowling as anyother terminally unhip bastion ofthe tackyana to claim as their own
.
but
then
, i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it
. it
' s cheesy all right
,
but connoisseurs ofthe bad taste will find thsi film exudes that bl
and smell of stale jokes rather tahn the invigorating stink of true kitsch
. that
' s a shame
, baceause
, in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more
. woody harrelson plays tyhe hotshot bowler on the rise
, roy munson
. the movie opens in hte fifties with roy
' s dad dishing out the reader
' s digest
/ gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls
, shifting tothe the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever
. the sardonic tone ofthe the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray
, as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken
. it
' s thanks to murray that the first quater of kingpin seems so good
- he gives the wry
, derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy
. mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job
,
then ab
andons him to an angry mob who mangle roy
' s h
and
. thn it
' s fast forward 17 years later when munson isnt a fat
, balding loser with a prosthetic rubber h
and
. he
' s hopeless untl he meets ishmael
( r
andy quaid
)
, an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege
. so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament inwhich reno
, picking up pretty hustler claudia
( vanessa angel
) onthe the way
. with the exit of bill murray
, the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go
,
and that
' s
.
.
. dumb
and dumber
. yes
, indeed
, kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour
, peter
and bobby farrelly
, tjhe directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle
. so
, prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber h
ands
, distended nipples
, ridiculous hair
and bull semen
. get set fo stock fish
- out
- of
- water situations when city
- boy roy puts on a beard
and tries to blend inspite with the amish community
, or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking
, striptease
and unchristian neighbour
- socking
. nowe
, don
' t get me wrong
, there
' s nothing wrong with cheap humour
,
and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody
and r
andy
. tje trouble is that these jokes aren
' t bold or funny enough to drive a movie thyat bumbles along without much sense of direction
. it lurches fomr sports movie to amish
- mocking to road
- trip to sentimental melodrama
,
( pausing forthe a broadside spoof of indecent proposal
, anbd many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack
)
, never quite getting it all together
. some gags fall flat from a lack of build
- up
, while there are bits
and pieces iin the movie that simply don
' t do anything
. why the long
, unfunny fight in the car park
? why two ofthe these
? why does that guy wear mascara
, or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose inwhich it
? the film is full of these half
- throught
- through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer
, grip or makeup artist throwing in r
andom stuff
and saying
,
" wouldn
' t that be funny
?
"
. well
, no
, actually
. the actors don
' t do the movie much favours either
. woody harrelson comes off okay
, plausibly acting dumb
, smart
, cynical or innocent when the implausible scirpt calls for it
,
but r
andy quaid is a ceaseless ham
,
and vanessa angel hasnt no talent
( like schwarzenegger
, she seems mroe convincing playing a computer
- creation than a human
-
- take the tv series weird science
.
.
. please
)
. even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movei
' s climax
. all in all
, a fairly useless attempt at comedy
,
and a certified no
- hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance
. we
' ll have to look to a reinspired john waters
, or perhaps somebody from down under
(
" strictly bowling
"
, anyone
?
) for the definitive bowling comedy
. thte flying inkpot
' s rating system
