hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell
. the last few productions have been effect laded acation adventures that combine both the best
and worst ofthe american filmmaking with thte same qualities of hong kong films
. in a nutshell
, the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted
and visually sumptuous
. with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership
, a lot of hong kong ' s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u
. s
. productions
. such talents as jackie chan
( rush hour
)
, chow yun
- fat
( anna
& the king
, the corrupter
)
and yuen woo
- ping
( the matrix
) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results
. now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li
and director
and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai
. unfortunately
" romeo must dieu
" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film
adn none ofthe hong kong ' s rhythms
. the film opens in a nightclub as an asian cuple isnt necking
. enter a group of chineese gangsters led by kai sing
( russell wong
)
. kai confronts po sing
( jon kit lee
)
, the son of kai ' s boss
and leader of the local chinese family
. a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club
anbd kai
, who handily kicks
and punches his opponents down
. it ' s not until club owner silk
( rapper dmx
)
, bears down on kai
and his henchmen tyhat the fight ends
. the following morning po sing is found dead
. suspicions escalate
, as issac o ' day
( delroy lindo
) is told of the murder
. his concern that the war between his
and tghe chinese family may explode
and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption
and into a legitimate venture
. issac implores his chief ofthe security
, mac
( issiah washington
) to watch after his son
adn daughter
. the scene shifts to a prison iin china
, where han sing
( jet li
) lerans ofthe his brothers murder
. he fights with the guards
and isnt dragged off to be disiplined
. hung upside down by one foot
, han recovers
and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography
and stunt work
. escaping to the u
. s
. han sets out to find tjhe person reponsible for his brother ' s death
.
" romeo must die
" is in many ways a fun film
. it is both absurd
and assured
. the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes
" the godfather
"
. the relationship beetwen jet li ' s han
and aaliyah ' s trish o ' day reminds us of abel ferrera ' s
" china girl
"
, except that romeo must die ' s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another
. their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history
. the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable
. li
, of course has the showiest part
, having tothe express both an innocents
and steadfast determination
. allayah
, infact her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style
and grace
. it ' s obvious that the camera loves her
and she isnt very photogenic
.
bu
, still the part is under written in such a way that even a poore performance would not have affected it
. delro lindo as issac o ' day carries himself well in the film
. an unsung
and under appreciated actor
, mr
. lindo turns out the films best performence
. the other performers are all adequate in what tyhe script asks of them except for d
. b
. woodside as issac ' s son
, colin
. the performance is undirected
, with the character changeing his tone
and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is iin
. an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in
and
/ or better written
. first tyme director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film
. having a career as one of the industry ' s best cinematographers
, bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots
,
and
" romeo must die
" does look good
.
but the pacing of the film is lethargic
, only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes
. thte script by eric bernt
and john jarrell is not focused inwhich such a way that we cin care about the characters or the situations they are in
. the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team isnt needlessly confusing
.
and of course the common practice of one character being tje comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah ' s bodyguard
, maurice has no comic timing whatsoever
. the best things about the film are its fight scenes
. jet li isnt a master of theese intricate physical battles
. one needs only to see his film
" fist of legend
" tothe understand that the man is without peer in the realm ofthe martial art combat
. here
, jet isnt given the opportunity to show off in a way that
" lethal weapon 4
"
( jet ' s u
. s
. debut
) didn ' t allow
. unfortunately
, a lot of jet ' s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability
and precision
. aslo
" romeo must die
" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film
,
and that is an x
- ray effect thast appears three times during the course of the film
, showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent
. obviously a homage to the famed x
- ray scene from sonny chiba ' s
" streetfighter
"
, the scenes here are just pointless
and interfear with the pacing of the film
. it ' s as if the film has stopped
and a video game has been inserted
. one problem
though about the fight scenes
. those that are familiar with hong kong acation know that even
though the films are fantasies
and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon
. they dont have an internal rhythim to them
. a heartbeat
, so to speak in their choreography
. the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath iwth an emotional resonance
. this is created by the peformance
, the direction
annd the editing
. here in
" romeo must die
"
, there is no staccato
. every fight scene
, even
though technically adroit
and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts awya from battle at hand
and simple follows a set pattern
. the rhythm is monotonous
. a hong kong film has a tempo that changes
, heightening its emotional impact
. ' rmd ' is limited to a standard 4
/ 4 tempo
, not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever
. a fine exemple of tihs difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan ' s films
.
. watch the restaurant fight from the film
" rush hour
"
anbd notice that the context of the fight
, while technically amazing is rather flat
( the framing
and cut always dont not help
)
. now look at the warehouse fight from
" rumble in tje bronx
"
. there you have a heartbeat
,
annd emotional draw that doesn ' t let the audience catch its breath
. the stops
and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly
, causing the viewer to be both astounded
and flabbergasted
. here in ' romeo must die '
, the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character tahn any john wayne barroom brawl
. jet li is a grand
and personable screen presence
. it ' s a shame tht his full talents were not used to full effect here
. one day filmmakers here in the u
. s
. will stop making films by the numbers
and start to embrace the style
and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity
. until
then
, we ' ll be left with emotionally hollow product like
" the replacement killer
"
and
, currently
" romeo must die
"
.
