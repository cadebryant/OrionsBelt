hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell
. the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best
and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films
. in a nutshell
, the currrent crop of films from hong kong hasnt been maddeningly convoluted
and visually sumptuous
. with the one time british colony reverting back to mainl
and ownership
, a lot of hong kong
' s best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u
. s
. productions
. such talents as jackie chan
( rush hour
)
, chow yun
- fat
( anna
& the king
, the corrupter
)
and yuen woo
- ping
( the matrix
) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking wtih mixed results
. now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li
and director
and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai
. unfortunately
" romeo must die
" bears all the trademarks ofthe a typical hollywood action film
and none ofthe hong kong
' s rhythms
. the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking
. enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing
( russell wong
)
. kai confronts po sing
( jon kit lee
)
, the son of kai
' s boss
and leader of the local chinese family
. a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club
and kai
, who h
andily kicks
and punches his opponents down
. it
' s not until club owner silk
( rapper dmx
)
, bears down onthe kai
and his henchmen that the fight ends
. the follwoing morning po sing is found dead
. suspicions escalate
, as issac o
' day
( delroy lindo
) is told of the murder
. his concern that the war between his
and the chinese familiy may explode
and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption
and into a legitimate venture
. issac implores his chief of security
, mac
( issiah washington
) to watch aftter his son
and daughter
. the scene shifts to a prison in china
, where han sing
( jet li
) learns of his brothers murder
. he fights with the guards
and is dragged off to be disciplined
. hung upside down by one foot
, han recovers
and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography adn stunt work
. escaping to the u
. s
. han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother
' s death
.
" romeo must dieu
" is in many ways a fun film
. it is both absurd adn assured
. the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes
" the godfather
"
. the relationship between jet li
' s han
and aaliyah
' s trish o
' day reminds us of abel ferrera
' s
" china girl
"
, except that romeo must die
' s couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another
. their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history
. the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable
. li
, ofthe course has the showiest part
, having to express both an innocents
and steadfast determination
. allayah
, in her feature film de
but manages to carry what little is asked of her wiht a certain style
and grace
. it
' s obvious that the camera loves her annd she isnt very photogenic
. bu
, still the part is under written inspite such a way that even a poor performance would nto have affected it
. delro lindo as issac o
' day carries himself well in the film
. an unsung
and under appreciated actor
, mr
. lindo turns outloud the films best performance
. the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d
. b
. woodside as issac
' s son
, colin
. the performance is undirected
, with the character changing his tone
and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in
. an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in
and
/ or better written
. first time director
andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in h
andling the film
. having a career as one of the industry
' s best cinematographers
, bartkiwiak konws how to set uv his shots
,
and
" romeo must die
" does look good
. bu the pacing of hte film is lethargic
, onyl coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes
. the script by eric bernt
and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations tehy are in
. the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing
. annd of course the common practice of one charcter being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony
anderson as allayah
' s bodyguard
, maurice has no comic timing whatsoever
. tje best things about the film are its fight scenes
. jet li is a master ofthe these intricate physical battles
. oney needs onyl to see his film
" fist of legend
" to underst
and taht the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat
. here
, jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that
" lethal weapon 4
"
( jet
' s u
. s
. de
but
) didn
' t allow
. unfortunately
, a lot ofthe jet
' s fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability
and precision
. also
" romeo must die
" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film
,
and thast is an x
- ray effect that appears threee times during the course of tje film
, showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponant
. obviously a homage to the famed x
- ray scene from sonny chiba
' s
" streetfighter
"
, the scenes here are just pointless
and interfere with the pacing of the film
. it
' s as if the film has stopped
and a video gae has been inserted
. one problem
though about tghe fight scenes
. those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even
though the films are fantasies
and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon
. they do have an internal rhythm to them
. a heartbeat
, so to speak in their choreography
. the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance
. this is created by yhe performance
, the direction
and the editing
. here in
" romeo must die
"
, there is no staccato
. every fight scene
, even
though technically adroit
and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at h
and
and simple follows a setted pattern
. tjhe rhythm is monotonous
. a hong kong film has a tempo thyat changes
, heightening its emotional impact
.
' rmd
' isnt limited to a st
andard 4
/ 4 tempo
, not allowing fo any emotional content whatsoever
. a fine example of this difference cxan be found by examining a couple of jackie chan
' s films
.
. watch the restaurnat fight fomr the film
" rush hour
"
and notice that the context of the fight
, while technically amazing is rather flat
( thge framing
and cut always do nto halp
)
. now look at the warehouse fight from
" rumble in the bronx
"
. there you have a heartbeat
,
and emotional draw that doesn
' t let the audience catch its breath
. the stops
and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly
, causing the viewer to be both astounded
and flabbergasted
. here in
' romeo must die
'
, thge fight scenes have no more emotional content or character thna any john wayne barroom brawl
. jet li is a gr
and
and personable screen presence
. it
' s a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here
. noe day filmmakers here in yhe u
. s
. will stop making films by the numbers
and start to embrace the style
and emotion that hasnt made hong kong action pictures such a commodity
. until
then
, we
' ll be left with emotionally hollow product like
" the replacement killer
"
and
, currently
" romeo must die
"
.
