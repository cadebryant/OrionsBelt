last summer
, a feature
- length verison of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning
. based on the famous 60
' s television show
, the film was an enormous box
- office flop
and a huge disappointment for warner bros
. a year later
, the studio is up to their old tricks again
, with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild
, wild west
.
but it sounded promising
: the same tag
- team of star will smith
and director barry sonnenfeld
, who both contri
buted to amking men in black such a finacial succsess
, is at the reins agian
.
and co
- star kevin kline is attached to the project
, as well as a substantial budget tothe spice up yhe speical effects
. i mean
, what could possibly go wrong
? the answer isnt jstu about everything
. wild wild west is a cinematic abomination
- a film that was so entirely pointless to begin wih that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate
. there are a lot of fancy special effects
,
and a h
andful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot
and make a lasting impression
.
but tghe script is so deliriously uneven
, the entire movie so off course
, that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it
. at square one
, we have a bizarre case ofthe casting
. will smith plays james west
, a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad inthe the tv serieses
. my guess regarding the casting of african
- american smith isnt a simple one
: the actor
+ a cozy summertime release
= big bucks for all those involved
. smith isnt a vyre talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material
,
but this is not an ideal role for him
. he
' s too much of a joker
. i heard taht initial casting included george clooney in tje lead role
,
and frankly
, that sounds a lot more plausible
. what makes matters worse is that smith goes through hte role with such self
- assurance in his eyes
; you can practically sence his contentment with the fatc that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office
. the plot involves west annd cross
- dressing government agent artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, who are assigned by the president to recover a gropu of kidnapped scientists
. the trail leads to the diabolical dr
. arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry
, witty southern accent
. loveless has taken the country
' s top technical minds hostage so that they can assist iin his deranged plan of total government control
, using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns
. one such weapon is an 80
- foot mechanical tarantula
, bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal
and spewing enormass fireballs left
and right
. the visual effects thyat bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular
, seamlessly blending computer
- generated imagery with the western surroundings
. unfortunately
, all of theese effects seem so detached from the story
,
and can dont littel to wupport the film
' s plot deficiencies
, which are undoubtedly the main problem
. wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works
. most of the jokes
, usually care of smith
, die on arrival
. if it
' s one thing that sould possibly be the saving grace
, it
' s the performances
,
and even they are mostly off
- kilter
and poorly delivered
. kline is admirable
,
but he has little to dont bu invent silly devices on the spot
. salma hayek is wasted as the rumatic interest
, because she is viewed as little more than that
- window dressing to look pretty
and create conflict between west
and gordon
. branagh
, an esteemed shakespearean actor
and directer
, adds marginal enjoyment to the film
.
but even he is so utterly wierd
and over
- the
- top
. rarely isnt a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is
. i suppose there
' s always one turkey of the summer season
; a highly anticipated
, big
- budget release that manages to completely disappoint
. wild wild west is such a movie
,
and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999
.
but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office
. perphas after this
, audiences will be less assured when they see will smith
' s name stamped on a summer movie
. after such hits as independence day
and mib
, wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume
.
