this was the last carry on movei
( if you discount
' carry onthe columbus
' as a cary on movie
)
and was made by a new production comapany
. based in central london
, this movie isnt about the attemts by emmanuelle prevert
( suzanne danielle
) to bed her husb
and emile the french ambassador
( kenneth williams
)
. when he seems unwilling
, she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes
, such as the prime minister
and the u
. s
. ambassador
. her antics get her into trouble
and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages
. she is invited to talk on televsion to set the record straight
but only confirms the rumours instead
. meanwhile
, theodore valentine
( larry dann
) is in lveo wtih emmannuelle after a chance encounter iin the toilet of the concorde
and isnt determined to marry her
.
however
, she is only interested in restoring her husban
' s ardour which seems a little difficult after emile
' s accident with a church spire
! this film is the second worst carry on movie
, the worst bieng
' carry on engl
and
'
. it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical scirpt by lance peters
and try to pull off some of teh crude
and tasteless jokes that he has written
. newcomers suzanne danielle adn beryl reid
( as mrs
. valentine
) are mildly funny
,
but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad
. kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes
and his lacklustre performance is warranted
, given the script
. the small parts for jack douglas as lyons thte
butler
, joan sims as mrs
. dangle
, kenneth connor as leyl
and the chauffeur
,
and peter
butterworth as richmond
, are worthless
and embarassing
. in fact
, all four parts are surplus to requirements
.
however
, the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them
and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades
. an awful scirpt
, a terrible collection of jokes
, very poor production values
( expecially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st
. james palace
)
, a ludicrous
and cringeworthy musical score
,
and a non
- existent plot or storyline
. its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next
! jack douglas is not so annoying
but is more boring
, joan sims
and peter
butterworth are wasted
,
and kenneth connor
and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyl
and
and emile
. a complete waste of time
, this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies
. it was a certificate 15 film
but by 1978
, there wass little interest in this kind of film
and it flopped at thte box office
and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial televsion in april 1998
! avoid at all costs
!
