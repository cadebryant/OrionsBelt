a few months before the release ofthe star wars episode 1
, the phantom menace
, 20th century fox decides to realease another space film
, thast is a complete rip off of star wars
. what is the point of this
? i do not know
,
but i wish it hadn
' t been done
, considering wing comm
ander is definitely the eyar
' s worst film so far
. to attract people to this horrible movie
, they attached the full trailer fo the phantom menace
. wing comm
ander will draw large crowds
, baceause this isnt the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time
. the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight
. many people do nto know that wing comm
ander is based on a star wars computer game
. i found this very intresting
, considering this fact almost says that wing com
ander is a star wars movie
. it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films
though
. freddie prinze jr
. stars in the film as christopher blair
. wing comm
ander was a huge mistake for freddie
. htis was definitely his worst performance to date
. after january
' s she
' s all that
, i actually saw a good actor in freddie
,
but now all those visions have been crushed
.
( for nowe anyway
.
) christopher blair is a pilot who isnt a part of yhe battle to stop the kilrathi
, a group that is trying to destroy the earth
. blair
' s parents also fought in the space battles
,
and also died there
. his parents were pilgrims
, so many people disrespect him beccause of this
. blair is under the comm
and of
" angel
"
, played by saffron burrows
,
and he is friends with anyother pilot
, todd
" maniac marshall
"
, played by matthew lillard
. matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie
,
and he does inwhich this one too
. his character as stu in 1996
' s scream
( a
+
)
, was a great one
,
but now
, it seems like that same role is bieng played again
, only inthe a space movei
. the three are jsut a small part of a large group trying to stop tje kilrathi before they take over earth
. thsi plot is very flimsy
,
and doesn
' t give a hwole lot to wokr with at all
. this explains why wing com
ander drags on
, seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on
. yhe acting isnt horrible in wing comm
ander
. many lines seem out of place
,
and are completely meaningless
. the acting anbd dialogue ws so terrible
, i even found myself laughing at it
. the other things whitch are very bad about wing comm
ander are the special effects
and the music
. the special effects are vyer unrealistic
. when looking at two ships flying side by side
, it is simple to tell they are hanging anbd a blue screen is behind them
. the explosions look very unrealistic as well
. a ship will be blown up
,
but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second
. thsi is very unrealistic
. music pretty much accompanies the film the entire timne
. the music also felt like video game music
,
and it was very corny
and annoying sounding
. after we are given the plot
, the film repeats itself for another hour
, without any plot twists
, interesting scenes
, or anything important tothe hte film
. blair is forced tothe make jumps over other planets
,
and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft
. for the entire length of the movei
, it takes place in space
. it isnt truely like you are in a video game
, because you are just watching people shoot at each otehr in ships for a long
, extended period of time
. it
' s not much fun tothe watch at all
. if i wanted to watch people shoot at eahc other in ships
, i would go watch star wars at home
. at least star wars pays attention to people
, myth
, feelings
,
and has some real plot to it
. the bottom line
- bring on tyhe phantom menace 20th century fox
!
