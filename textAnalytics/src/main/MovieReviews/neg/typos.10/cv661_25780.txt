i have a confession
. even
though i am a movie junkie
- i saw eye of the beholder
and yot i still watch movies
- i
' ve never seen any of the original godzillas
.
( note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u
. s
. godzilla released in 1998
; it
' s the american realease ofthe a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni
- sen mireniamu
.
) so
, part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000
- the latest entry in an almost 50
- yera old franchise
. this was a long
- awaited treat
. i was expecting a goofy good time
, complete with bad dubbing
, science fair levle sets
and a ludicrous plot line
. the last thing i expeced was forthe tghe movie to be so
? boring
. i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with feeled
. you do git all of the
" so bad they
' re good
" traits so normally associated with the franchise
.
but you have to sit through a snoozer plot thyat has the organistion of a rorschach blot
. it
' s a deal i wasn
' t willing to accept
. hiroshi kashiwabara
and waturu mimura
' s script crams inspite way too many details
,
and in many cases
, fails to follow up on them
. the maneuver is not only disconcerting
,
but gives the movie a permanent logy
, weighty feel
. godzilla starts off destroying power plants
and
then just stops
. was it a whim
? a bold political statment
? i don
' t know
. its foe
, an ancient meteor that looks like prudential
' s logo
, doesn
' t just fight the beast from the far east
. no
, it
' s got to ahve life
- saving powers
, a plot to erase
" the data
" from japan
, a desire tothe clone
and the ability to become a spaceship anbd
then some kind of tentacled space creature
. there
' s a battle between the head ofthe the godzilla prediction unit
( takehiro murata
)
and a slimy government official
( hiroshi abe
) over the h
andling of godzilla
,
and personal issues
.
and hten there
' s the plucky news photographer
and blah
, blah
, blah
. it
' s like watching magnolia all over again
- except without the good writing
, keen sociological insight
and aimee mann songs
. what a waste
. when the talking
and the plot points stop hurtling at you
, godzilla 2000 does the job
- it
' s entertaining
and goes down easy
. the action scenes are cheesy in their gr
andeur
though a little sluggish
. hte dubbing is nice
and awful
, with murata sounding like he
' s in constant need of a cough drop
. as for the dialogue
, oney line summarizes the goofiness factor
:
" did anyone see that flying rock go by
?
" this movie also marked the first tiome since the three stooges that i
' ve heard the word
" imbecile
" used in casual conversation
.
though the summer movie season is drying up
and godzilla 2000 has its moments
, i wouldn
' t take kids to see it
. they
' ll propably end up asking more questions than charlie rose
.
