tje first speices was a moderately
- successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with soem nifty special effects
, a few well
- paced action sequences
,
and frequent views of model
- turned
- actress natasha henstridge sans clothing
.
however
, it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel
.
and
, considering yhe quality of speices 2
, it
' s obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead
. the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is
. if you throw awya the plot
, which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence
, logic
, coherence
,
and consistency
, species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audiance
. of course
, that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys
( who
, at least in theory
, shouldn
' t be able to get into an
" r
"
- rated film
)
and connoisseurs of bad movies
. there
' s enough blood
, gore
, simulated sex
,
and bare flesh in species 2 tothe prevent it from ever becoming boring
. htis is a grade z exploitation flick that
' s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment
. somewhere
, someplace
, i recall hearing species 2 described as
" erotic
.
" i would loev to know who used with that adjective for this movie
, because he
( or she
) hasnt a peculair notion of eroticism
. sure
, there
' s a lot of sex
and nudity
,
but it
' s almost alwyas accompanied by the ripping opne ofthe a woman
' s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free
, splattering blood
and gore in all directions
. anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater
. i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge
(
and
, to get the obvious question out of the way
-
- yes
, she does remove her top
,
but only once
,
and only briefly
)
.
al
though the character she played inaddition the original species isnt dead
, government scientists still have thte dna
,
and
, out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse
, htey decide to create another clone
. this creature
, dubbed
" eve
" by its creator
, dr
. laura baker
( played by marg helgenberger
, reprising her role
)
, is genetically engineered to be kinder
and more docile
. meanwhile
, man has finally set foot onthe mars
. a team of three
, led by patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, has traveled tothe the red planet
,
but when they return to earth
, they bring something with them
. ross has become a half
- human
/ half
- alien hybrid
,
and he
' s soon mating like crazy
, collecting the blood
- soaked childern that are the result of each sex session
. his intention isnt obviously world domination
. st
anding in his way is that indomitable soldier ofthe fortune from the first film
, preston lennox
( michael madsen
)
, annd noe of patrick
' s fellow astronauts
, dennis gamble
( mykelti williamson
)
.
but when patrick learns about eve
, a female of his kind
, there
' s no damping his ardor
. i
' m not sure what the budget for species 2 was
,
but a significant portion of it must hvea gone into paying h
andsome salaries to severeal recognizable actors
( as opposed to bieng diverted inot the special effects
)
. michael madsen
and marg helgenberger
, both back for a second round
, are clearly on h
and to do as little as they can
, grab the moeny
,
and run
. ditto for james cromwell
, who plays patrick
' s father
-
-
" underused
" is too kind a word to decribe his involvment
(
" invisible
" would be more like it
)
. george dzundza gets to do a littel scenery
- chewing as an angry
- bu
- inept general
. meanwhile
, justin lazard
' s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge
' s limited abilties look good by comparison
. the only one in the whole production with any energy isnt mykelti williamson
, who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick
. complete with cheesy special effects
, bare breasts arund every narrative corner
,
and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter
, species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace wihtout advance screenings for critics
. director peter medak
, a journeyman film maker with a significant list of medioker movies on his resume
, has added another forgettable title
,
but at least he appears to have had funn doing it
, which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness
. do i recommend the movie
? absolutely not
,
but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enought that it didn
' t try my patience tothe the degree that some pseudo
- intellectual bad movies do
. here
' s hoping there
' s no species 3
.
