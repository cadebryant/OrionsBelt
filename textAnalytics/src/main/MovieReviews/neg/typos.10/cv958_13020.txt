in times of crisis people are driven to despreate measures
. of course what constitutes a crisis differs from person to person
. what may be a disasterous situation for one
, may be seen as a challenge to another
. as deepak chopra is known to say
,
" it
' s not the ride
, it
' s the rider
.
" unfortunately clear
- thinking is not always the reaction to problems
. wall street wheeler dealer steven taylor
( michael douglas
) is a man with troubles
. he
' s sunk his money in illegal financial activities
and it
' s blown up in his face
. in a matter of dyas he will loose it all
. his wife emily
( gwyneth paltrow
) is a highly
- placed un interpreter
and is not happy with her life eather
. her marriage is cold
and unfulfilling
. unknown to her
, her new lover david shaw
( viggo mortensen
) is not only a painter
,
but an ex
- con with a history of bilking wealthy women of their money
. emily is a prime target
: she
' s worth over
$ 100 million
. steven
' s solution to his predicament is tothe offer david half a million to kill his wife
. the artist accepts
and the movie is underway
. drawing from frederick knott
' s play
and loosley based on hitchcock
' s dial m for murder
, this is all
- too tipical of summer releases
. all style
and no substance
. annd there
' s really nto much style
. directer
andrew davis
( thte accomplished witness
and best
- forgotten other films
) has made exactlly the wrong choices at almost every turn
. douglas
and paltrow hvea both shown us that they are skillful actors in previvous films
. mortensen showed promise in the past
. here all threee are walking uninterestingly thru their roles with oddly waxen faces
. the only person who shows any sense of life is david suchet as new york detective mohamed karaman
. he
' s only on
- screen long enought to make you think that there might be a likable person in the film
and
then he disappears
. the first concern of a suspense film is to create suspense
. surprises are important
. in this movie the audience keeps waiting for something to happen
.
and nothing ever doesnt
. nearly every event is telegraphed in advance
. close
- up on this object or that action
and it
' s easy tothe guess what
' s going to happen
. as the film plods towards its inevitable conclusion yuo keep expecting a plot twist to make the movie worthwhile
. it
' s a hopeless quest
. the story doesn
' t make much sence
. steven
' s wife is loaded
. even with unfriendly relations
, you
' d think that he could have talked to her about his difficulty rather than deciding to kill her
. when he does decide onthe the dire plan he makes an unreasonable choice
. if you were going to hire someone to kill your wife
, would your firt choice be her lover
? no matter how sleazy he is
, i would think there might be a chance that he would turn down the opportunity
. why would steven plan the murder as a break
- in in theri apartment
? why not just take her out as she was walking to david
' s loft in a bad neighborhood
? while deciding among the numberous summer films
, you might do well to skip this one
. you
' ll find more suspense than this movie offers by watching the weather channel
.
