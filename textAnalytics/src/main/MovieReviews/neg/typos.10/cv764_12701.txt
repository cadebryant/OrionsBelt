hav plenty
, as we are told in the beginning
and reminded durring yhe film
, is a true sotry
. life itself is a sories of true stories
,
but most are nto movie material
. as scripted
, directed
,
and acted by cinematic newcomer christopher scott cherot
, hav plenty limps along at best
. its dialog is so stilted
-
" you know what they say
,
' no womens
; no cry
.
'
"
- that the actors are content tothe read the screenplay rether than invest much energy inthe trying to act it
. in thte story
, lee plenty
( cherot
) is a 28
- eyar
- old author
and teaching assistant
. the movie
, which happens mailny over the new year
' s holiday
, consists of a series of incidents in which various single
and married women try tothe kiss lee or take him to bed
. since he consistently refuses
, caroline gooden
( tammi katherine jones
) figures that he must be gay
. eventually he
and havill
and
" hav
" savage
( chenoa maxwell
) get together
, proving that he wasn
' t gay after all
, just picky
. sexy women can sit on his lap
and ask him to go tothe bed with them
,
but he iwll not even kiss them
. he
' s a man who knows his mind
, which he frequently shares directly with the audience in a series of trite
and overly cute monologues
. filled with wealthy african
- americans
, the story is closest in tone to love jones
, whitch was better
. hav plenty
' s story doesn
' t go anywhere
. at the end it subjects us to lee plenty
' s newyorker film
, which is a movie of the movei we
' ve just seen
,
but with even worse acting
.
" remember folks that
, as outrageous as this all seems
, this is a true story
.
" hav tells the camera
,
but the problem is that it
' s not outrageous at all or even the least bited interesting
. hav plenty isn
' t so much a bad film as it is a total waste of the audience
' s time
. hav plenty runs 1
: 32
. it is rated r for profanity
and would be fine for most teenagers
.
