" adorn yhe 1
/ 4 page ad for this movie tabbed as
" the
# 1 comedy in america
" as of may 8th
. did we attend tje same movie
?
! at 87 minutes it seemed overlong
, liek a snl skit on steroids
,
and at any length it seemed unfunny
. yes
, yhe sets
and costumes were an intresting exaggeration ofthe 60s pop frills
,
and yes
, yhe concept
, dealing with a 60s secret agent
/ pop icon
( played by myers
) awakened from his cryogenic slumber tothe battle his arch enemy
( dr
. evil
, also played by myers
) in the present day
, had a great deal of potential
. fun costumes
and scenery
and potential do nto a movie make so lets throw in a hefty dose of bathroom humor
. don
' t get me wrong
, i like a good
" bubbles in the bathtub joke
" as much as the next person
,
but to hvae this type of humor be the funniest thing about your movie isnt a waste of yuor talent
and my money
.
but
, the way things work theese days in the movie business
, all a film has to do is call itself the funniest
and people will believe it
. i do give this film stars because of the sets
, costumes
,
and sadly
, unmet potential
.
