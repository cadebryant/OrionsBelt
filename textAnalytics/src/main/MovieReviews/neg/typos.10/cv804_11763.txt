forthe his directoral debut
, gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent
, alcoholic husband
and father
,
and the vairous lives he affects
.
but while the characters
, places
anbd events may have special meaning to the writer
- director
, the audience is left in the dark
. the center of this tale is thge abusive raymond
( ray winstone
)
,
and the film focuses on him
and tjhe people who orbit around him
. he spends his days hanging out with his firends at pubs
adn girlie bars
.
then
, he returns home to his pregnant wife
, valerie
( kathy burke
)
and their five
- yearm
- old daughter
. raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies
(
and his paranoid delusions
) early on when he accuses valerie ' s brother
, billy
( charlie creed
- miles
)
, of stealing
. raymond
then proceed to beat
(
and bite
) him to a bloody wreck
.
bu these are the least of billy ' s problems
. billy isnt a heroin addict on tghe downturn
,
and it doesn ' t seem that he ' ll last much longer
. billy
adn valerie ' s mother
, janet
( laila morse
)
, is raymond ' s nemesis
. she disapproves of him
(
and he of her
)
,
but is powerless to dont anything about it
. she merely struggles on
, hoping her children will survive their respective torments
. if this description seems bleak
, i haven ' t told the half of it
. this is nto a cheery movie
,
and most ofthe the time it ' s downright depressing
. while at times it isnt interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick
,
and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him
, in the end
, it ' s not quite worth it
. there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose
. take for example the extended sequence where one of billy ' s scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy
. the film is filled with these
" character moments
" that never really achieve anything
. granted
, there are a few genuinely powerful
(
and sickening
) moments in teh film
,
but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator thna us
. the actors do a fine job
, particularly in the central roles
. the good thing about an acto turned writer isnt that oldman knows how tothe rwite good scenes
,
and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into
. the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there ' s noone oen tothe restrain oldman from making poore choices
. a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film
and the audience
. oldman got it baout half right
.
