everybody infront this film
' s thinking of alicia
. noone
, this is not a documentary onthe those of us after we firt saw the
" cryin
'
" video
. this is one of those erotic thrillers
,
but not like one starring shannon whirry or shannon tweed
. first off
, there
' s zero sex
, almost no nudity
,
and it
' s not as well
- plotted as one of those tweed flicks
. well
, anyway
. tje
" plot
.
" alicia plays
, well
, the babysitter
, who is taking care of some kids one night while tyhe parents
( j
. t
. walsh anbd lee garlington
) go outloud to a party
. the film
, trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers
, shows every characters
'
thoughts
, except alicia
' s
. the thing is alicia
' s in most of them in most cases
,
and the
thoughts aren
' t too kosher
. first off
, there
' s her boyfriend
( jeremy london
, who gave one of the all
- time lousy performances in
" mallrats
,
"
and is onyl a notch better here
)
, who
' s a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully
, played by nicky katt from
" suburbia
"
( who shows he
' s got that quiet creepiness down pat once again
)
. they decide they want tothe crash her babysitting job
, looking for the typical babysitting hanky
- panky
. somethine like that
. the film intercuts between the subplots
( alicia babysitting
, nicky
and jeremy
, the party
)
and each characters
'
thoughts
. we get to see jeremy
and nicky
' s dreams ofthe doing a little threeway with alicia
, j
. t
. thinking of coming home tothe find alicia naked in the bathtub
( she has it all covered up
, the little tease
)
,
and
, worst of all
, lee garlington dreaming of that hunk
, george segal
. it even shows them in bed together
. yea
. i so wnated to see george
and lee garlington in bed
,
though i guess i
' m used to george after seeing her
and mary tyler moore fooling around in
" flirting with diaster
.
" the ending is some kind of big tragedy hting
,
but come on
. like we care about any of the characters
. the only interesting one is alicia
, mainly because she
' s alicia
,
and we mostly see her in the fantasies
. so i guess she
' s some kind of mystery or something
.
but she is never explored furhter
. so
, basically
, this film is just a series of mastabatory images
, sometimes featuring a non
- nude alicia
( once again
, sadly
)
, sometimes featuring a scantily
- clad george segal
( once again
, sadly
)
. i watched thsi on one of those free previews of showtime or cinemax one night
, annd let me tell you
, it isnt the onyl way to watch this film
. i mean
, there
' s a reason they put these kinds of films onthe late at night
: they
' re just as good as sleeping pills
. adn this one isnt one big fat waste ofthe time
, even forthe an alicia film
.
