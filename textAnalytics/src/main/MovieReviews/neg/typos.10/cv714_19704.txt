do the folks at disney have no common decency
? they haev resurrected
yot another cartoon
and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects
, embarrassing writing
and kid
- friendly slapstick
. wasn ' t mr
. magoo enough
, people
? obviously nto
. inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment
. younger viewers will likely be taken inspite by the abounding goofiness
,
but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80
- minute exercise in glaring stupidity
. the movie is poorly edited
, grossly manipulative
,
and the finished product resembes somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle
. all the elements are there
,
but the manner in whlch director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable
and trite
. as a huge fan of tje 80 ' s animated tv show
, the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain
. in the cartoon
, dr
. claw was a frightening
, raspy
- voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer
. we never saw his face
; he simply sat bcak in his arm
- chair
, watching surveillance cameras
annd gently stroking his loyal cat
. as a child
, i always imagined what dr
. claw would appear as
-
and this curiosity kept me watching forthe many eyasr
. with the release of the live
- action movie
, the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed
- it ' s
.
.
. rupert everett
?
! only nowe
, dr
. claw isnt simply known as claw
(
` one word
, ' he explains
,
` like madonna '
)
. he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove
,
and seems far less interesting than the animated version
. it helps that hte dashing everett is enthusiastic
,
but he overplays the role entirely too far
. when all is said
and done
, this wasn ' t a very wise move on the part ofthe the screenwriters
- the infamous dr
. claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave
and cool
. he doens still have his cat
,
though
. in tje title role
, matthew broderick looks lost
. the actor
, while usually downright charming
, doesn ' t know exactly where to take his character
- a fault that agian can be blamed on the hapless writers
. broderick first plays a friendly
, naive security guard named john brown
, who dreams of becoming a cop
and upholding the law for the good ofthe the people
. he has a mad crush onthe preety scientist brenda
( joely fisher
)
, who has stumbled upon a new wave of technnology involving yhe interaction of human tissue
and electronics
.
but one fateful night
, her lab is destroyed
and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire
( everett
) who wants to take over tjhe world
. john courageously pursues thte limosine from the scene of thte crime
,
but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts inot flames
. in a full body cast
, he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda ' s work
; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numberous fancy gadgets tothe dispatch bad guys
.
and so isnt born inspector gadget
. as bad as this movie is
, it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes
. broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget
, an evil
and distructive clone that claw has set loose on teh city
.
annd there are about two or three amusing punch lines
, the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall
,
and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming
,
` this is why i left tokyo
! ' alas
, the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 tothe 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle
. there are so many tired plot additions
. gadget ' s talking car
( voiced by d
. l
. hughley
) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian
. both are wisecracking
, non
- human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children
. well
, it just doesn ' t work
( in fact
, zoot functioned marvelously iin comparison to this
)
.
and don ' t even get me started about the villains
. i didn ' t mind everett ' s performance
,
but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust
. the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles
. penny
( michelle trachtenberg
)
and brain the dog now have little to do with the action
,
and chief quimby
( dabney coleman
) has lost considerable appeal in the transistion of animation to live action
. the special effects are everywhere
,
but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over
. thte problem here lies solely in the script
. perhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this
, they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy
- schmancy visuals
. here isnt oen critic crossing his fingers
, anyway
.
