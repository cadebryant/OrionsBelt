. running time
: 117 minutes directed by
: christian duguay i ' ve never fully understood wesley snipes ' s career
. he has his ups
adn downs
,
but mostly the downs
. his best movie was one of the best of 1998
and that movie was entitled
" blade
"
. he has had his typical action movies
,
" boiling point
"
,
" pasenger 57
"
,
but his new movie
" the art of war
" should jstu be called
" rising sun 2
: the art of war
" cause basically it ' s a semi
- remake ofthe the same plot
, with a differnt cast
,
and forced tothe be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller
, that is high on style
and low on substance
. wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for thte u
. n
. aftter a chinese ambassador is killed
, he is onthe the track of the killer
, trying to find out who it is
, how it happened
, where the killer was
,
and what to do
. anne archer plays his
" boss
" type person ofthe the u
. n
.
and she has hired snipes to track down the killer
. well snipes is mistakenly framed as teh killer
,
and is now an outlaw
, kidnapping a chinese woman with him
,
and having her help him along the way
. all this leads to a finale that is so dumb
,
and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb
,
and the stunts
, dialogue
and acting all ruin this movie
. wesley snipes isn ' t one of my favorite actors because of the fact tath the character he plays in every movie is the same character he plays infront the movie before
. tjhe only good role snipes has really had was in 1998 ' s
" blade
"
. i walked into
" the art of war
" expecting a ogod
, high octane thriller
,
and all i got was a pile of mush
. the only real ' good ' thing the movei has is action
,
and plenty of it
,
but i noticed it is badly filmed
, the camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on
. tyhe ending finale is so worthless
and pitiful
, that it even tries to mock
" yhe matrix
"
, laughably funny
, it is undeniably stupid
. christian duguay ' s direction is also not that great
. his camera angles
and sense ofthe style are all in place
,
but sadly his lighting
and editing are all badly done
. even the whole
" matrix
" ending wasn ' t even ogod
. the stunts
and action are badly filmed
,
and badly choreographed
. his placing of the characters
,
and the assination ofthe the chinese ambassador
,
and the plotting of thte movie are so predictable
and laughable
, that it just takes all the fun out ofthe the entire movie
. anne archer who is usually good in her roles
, turns in a horrible job here
. she is sour
, downbeat
,
and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue
,
and dumb moves
. even donald sutherland as a co
- star can ' t save this movie from bieng a bust
. so for an overall opinion
:
" the art of war
" is a total waste of time
. it ' s not intertaining
, nor exciting
, or even action packed
. it isnt a pointless movei
,
and mkaes absolutely no sense at all
. if you really want to see a good version of
" the art of war
"
, rent the wesley snipes
and sean connery action vehicle ofthe the same kind
" rising sun
"
, it isn ' t a great film either
,
but at least it ' s better than this
.
