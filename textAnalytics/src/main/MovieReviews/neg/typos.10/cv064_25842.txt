' ve never fully understood wesley snipes
' s career
. he has his ups annd downs
,
but mostly the downs
. his best movie ws one of the best of 1998
and that movie ws entitled
" blade
"
. he hasnt had his typical action movies
,
" boiling point
"
,
" passenger 57
"
,
but his new movie
" the art of war
" should just be called
" rising sun 2
: the art ofthe war
" cause basically it
' s a semi
- remake of the same plot
, with a different cast
,
and forced to be a ridiculously unbelievable thriller
, that is high on style anbd low on substance
. wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u
. n
. after a chineese ambassador is killed
, he is on the track of the killer
, trying to find out who it is
, how it happened
, where the killer was
,
and what to do
. anne archer plays his
" boss
" type person of the u
. n
.
and she has hired snipes to track down the killer
. well snipes isnt mistakenly framed as the killer
,
and is now an outlaw
, kidnapping a chinese woman with him
,
and having her help him along the way
. all this leads to a finale that is so dumb
,
and so stupid that is it unbelievably dumb
,
and the stunts
, dialogue
and acting all ruin this movie
. wesley snipes isn
' t one of my favorite actors because of the fact that the charcter he plays in every movie is thte same character he plays in the movie before
. the only good role snipes has really had was in 1998
' s
" blade
"
. i walked into
" the art of war
" expecting a good
, high octane thriller
,
and all i got was a pile of mush
. the only rela
' good
' thing the movie has is action
,
and plenty of it
,
but i noticed it is badly filmed
, teh camera is so shaky you cannot even tell what is going on
. yhe endig finale is so worthless
and pitiful
, that it even trys to mock
" the matrix
"
, laughably funny
, it is undeniably stupid
. christian duguay
' s direction is also not that great
. his camera angles
and sense of style are all in place
,
but sadly his lighting
and editing are all badly done
. even hte whole
" matrix
" ending wasn
' t even good
. the stunts
and action are badly filmed
,
and badly choreographed
. his placing of the characters
, anbd the assination of the chinese ambassador
,
and the plotting of the movie are so predictable
and laughable
, thta it just takes all the fun out of the entire movie
. anne archer who is usually good in her roles
, turns in a horrible job here
. she is sour
, downbeat
,
and dreadfully dull with her forced dialogue
,
and dumb moves
. even donald sutherl
and as a co
- star cant
' t sive this movie from being a bust
. so for an overall opinion
:
" the art of war
" isnt a total waste of time
. it
' s not entertaining
, nor exciting
, or even action packed
. it is a pointless movie
,
and makes absolutely no sense at all
. if you really want tothe see a good version of
" the art of war
"
, rent the wesley snipes
and sean connery action vehicle of the same kind
" rising sun
"
, it isn
' t a gerat film eather
,
but at least it
' s better than this
.
