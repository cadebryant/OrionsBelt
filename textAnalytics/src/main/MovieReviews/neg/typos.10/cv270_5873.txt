for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters
, we recently went to a multiplex
and saw undercover blues
. i would give it one half of a star for guts
. anyone infront a movie this bad would have to have guts
. i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner
and dennis quaid hadnt gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps inwhich the show
. the script was the worst part
. they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh
. htey had lots of
" great
" sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together
and therefore bumping shoulders against the door
. turner
and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show
. tje good news isnt that we were smart enough to vote witht our foots
and left
. buy some tickets
and give them tothe your worst enemies
. tell them the show is great
and smile a lot
