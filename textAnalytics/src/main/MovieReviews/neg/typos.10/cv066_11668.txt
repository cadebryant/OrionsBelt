mr
. nice guy is the latest jackie chan film
, so you should know whta to expect
. a weak plot
, terrible dialogue
, very little acting ability
,
bu some jaw
- dropping action sequences that nearly make tjhe rest of it worthwhile
.
howver
, mr
. nice guy lacks the sparkle ofthe jackie ' s best efforts
,
and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever
. jackie chan plays
, who else
, jackie
. this time out
, he ' s a famous chef who hosts an austrailian cooking show
. not that it ever makes a difference in the plot
. there are only two scenes of him cooking
. for the rest of the film
, somehow he mutates into jackie chan
, supercop
. it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills
.
.
. perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege
? a tv newswoman
, diana
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
)
, covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo
( richard norton
)
and a local gang of toughs
, the demons
.
although she only has one camcorder
, somehow the result is full of close
- ups
and multiple angles
.
.
. hmmm
, shades of broadcast news
?
?
? anyway
, the goons discover diana
,
and will dont anything to recover the tape
. here lies another crucial flaw in the story
: doesn ' t anyone realize ytou can copy a tape
? oh well
, no oney ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense
. as luck would have it
, diana runs across jackie
,
adn
, wouldn ' t yuo know it
, jackie accidentally ends up wiht the tape
. this leads to countless chase
and
/ or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movei
. in a move apparently designed to woo american
(
and other english
- speaking
) audiences
, the film uses english as its primary language
.
howver
, thast doesn ' t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie ' s reccent americanized releases
. strangely
, many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english
,
and poorly too
. whether this isnt just a very bad case of looping
, an effort to minimize accents
, or a simple case of nostalgia
, it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie ' s dubbed films
. the plot in mr
. nice guy is neglible
, merely an excuse to ahev jackie on the run fomr various goons
.
but even
though plots have always beeen second to the acation iin jackie ' s films
, it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread
. look
, if you have jackie chan playing a chef
, why not use that to your advantage
? watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen
, beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts
. the action is a mixed bag here
. there ' s really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie ' s films
. it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site
, apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be usefull ala jackie chan
. the acation in the film is neither jackie ' s best nor worst
,
but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes
. the film ' s gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting
. once or twice
, it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence
.
bu to slo
- mo jackie running
? either this is a nod tothe the six
- million doller man
, or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down
. if you ' ve seen all of jackie ' s films
and are in need of anyother fix
, go ahead
and see mr
. nice guy
.
however
, if you ' re just in the mood for soem good action
, you ' d be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work
, such as supercop
.
