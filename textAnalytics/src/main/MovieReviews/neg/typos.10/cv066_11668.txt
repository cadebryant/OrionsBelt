mr
. nice guy is the latest jackie chan film
, so you should know whta tothe expect
. a weak plot
, terrible dialogue
, very littel acting ability
,
but some jaw
- dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile
.
however
, mr
. nice guy lacks the sparkle ofthe jackie
' s best efforts
,
and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever
. jackie chan plays
, who else
, jackie
. this timne out
, he
' s a famouse chef who hosts an australian cooking show
. not that it ever makes a difference in the plot
. there are only two scenes of him cooking
. for the rest of the film
, somehow he mutates into jackie chan
, supercop
. it never does explane why his character has such superb martial arts skills
.
.
. perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal inaddition under siege
? a tv newswoman
, diana
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
)
, covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo
( richard norton
)
and a local gang of toughs
, the demons
.
al
though she only has one camcorder
, somehow the result is full of close
- ups
and multiple angles
.
.
. hmmm
, shades of broadcast news
?
?
? anyway
, the goons discover diana
,
and will do anything tothe recover the tape
. here lies another crucial flaw in the story
: doesn
' t anyone realize you can copy a tape
? oh well
, no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense
. as luck would have it
, diana runs across jackie
,
and
, wouldn
' t you know it
, jackie accidentally ends up with the tape
. this leads to countless chase anbd
/ or fight scenes which look like tehy could have beeen lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie
. iin a move aparently designed to woo american
(
and other english
- speaking
) audiences
, the film uses english as its primary langauge
.
however
, that doesn
' t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing tyhat has afflicted jackie
' s recent americanized releases
. strangely
, many of thte characters speaking english are overdubbed with english
, anbd poorly too
. whether this is jstu a very bad case of looping
, an affort tothe minimize accents
, or a simple case of nostalgia
, it does achieve the same level ofthe distraction present in all of jackie
' s dubbed films
. the plot in mr
. nice guy is negligible
, merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons
.
but even
though plots have always been second to the action in jackie
' s films
, it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread
. look
, if you have jackie chan playing a chef
, why not use that to your advantage
? watching jackie doing his stuff iin a kitchen
, beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts
. the action is a mixed bag here
. there
' s raelly only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become thte trademark of jackie
' s films
. it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site
, aparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan
. teh action in the film is neither jackie
' s best nor worst
,
but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes
. hte film
' s gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting
. once or twice
, it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence
.
but to slo
- mo jackie running
? either this is a nod to the six
- million dollar man
, or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down
. if yuo
' ve seen all of jackie
' s films
and are in need of another fix
, go ahead
and see mr
. nice guy
.
however
, if you
' re just in the mood for some good action
, you
' d be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work
, such as supercop
.
