this is one of the worst big
- screen film experiences i
' ve had for a while
. with this film
, plus
` showgirls
'
and
` basic instinct
'
, paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors
. his celebrated film
` total recall
' was
? i admitt
? successully scripted
,
but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws
. obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven
, the result being that much of the special effects in
` starship
' seemed fake
.
but nto everything bad in the film was the director
' s fault
, even
though he was one of the guys who employed the actors
. it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards
( i expected five for the acting categories
)
. casserole vanity devoid
, dense ribald
, dingy miasma
,
and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school
. no
, they have tothe pass primary school drama classes first
. while
` total
' was written well
,
` starship
' isnt purely pathetic
. all right
, it is supposed to be a fast
- paced entertainment film
,
and you
' re supposed to turn off your intellect
( completely
) annd enjoy the action sequences
and special effects
( that is
, guts
and gore
)
. as a matter of fatc
, i found the activity incredibly boring
, a complete waste of more thna two hours
. half of tje film was a bad episode of
` beverly hills 90210
'
( dina meyer was in
" beverly hills
"
)
, while another quarter was simply nothing
( things like presenting irrelevant infromation in an irritating way on hte web
)
,
and hte rest ws a display of humans fighting computer
- generated images
. the battles were all the same
? jumping around
, shoot or get stabbed
? annd onthe barren planets that only had giant insects
. there weren
' t even any stunts
, which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around
. i wonder what the insects eat
, if htere
' s nothing
but them on the planets
? there is so much laughable treatment in this film
,
and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended
. tihs type ofthe story is obviously aimed at 10
- year
- olds
, who can
' t see it anyway becouse of the violence
and some sexuality
.
but
then
, htere are always 16
- year
- olds who have that frame of mind
. the pointless plot begins when johnny
' s
( vanity devoid
) girlfriend carmen
( richards
) decides tht she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth
. johnny
then signs up as a trooper also
, after an overacted argument with his parents
.
but there is another girl
, dizzy
( meyer
)
, who likes johnny
and
then there is another boy who likes carmen
, which results in a loev quadrangle
, whcih isn
' t better
, because it means augmented worse
- than
- stereotyped soap opera
, increased bitchiness
,
and more bad beverly hills
+ melrose
.
and the result of this love quadrangle at tghe end is also rather stupid
. anyway
, getting back to the thing you might call plot
, johnny is too stupid to be a pilot
and has to join the infantry
, while his girl
and the other dude are in the smae leage
. dizzy comes chasing johnny
and joins the infantry also
. they
then strat training
, which contains what roger ebert calls ips
( idiot plot syndrome
, moments when only an idiat would haev made such obvious mistakes
)
,
then real combat
.
and guess what
? that
' s about as complex as it gets
. oh
,
and one of their friends
, carl
( neil patrick harris a
. k
. a
. doogie howser m
. d
.
)
, becomes involved in war intelligence
, adn his abilities at the end are really corny
and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it
. he
' s my fith nom for a razzie
. the troopers fight
, fall in love
, dieu
, kill
,
and try to act
. naturally
, they win
, or sort of half
- win
. of course
, in between
(
and at the end
) there are soldiers chatting
and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs
. the bugs also suffer from ips
: why would you release hold of your captive before killing it
? isn
' t it allso amazing that earthlings haven
' t invented better h
and
- held weapons by
then
? the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero
. well
, maybe a
- quarter
( of a star
) for the originality of the co
- sex shower scene
and the
( very
) brief moments of suspense
, another quarter for copying
` zulu
' adn letting the ogod guys
( the bugs
) win
,
and half a star for the sucking
- out ofthe the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors
(
but there should hvea been more
, the troopers deserved to die
)
.
