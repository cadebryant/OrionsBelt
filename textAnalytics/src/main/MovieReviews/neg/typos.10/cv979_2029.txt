robin hood
: men in tights is another mel
- brooks
- produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles
and young frankenstein
. mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life
, his fast paced dialogue
and sharp wit
. unfortunately
, robin hood
: men inthe tights has none of the eazy going humor of blazing saddles
, none of the fun acting of young frankenstein
, isnt devoid of the charm of spaceballs
,
and is even lacking the good
, solid dialogue of history of the world
. it is
, in short
, one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks
, or anybody else
, produce
. the plot borrows heavily from the well
- received kevin costner movie ofthe last year
, robin hood
: prince of thieves
. this is not surprising in
and of itself
,
and could have been used to grat comic effect
, mailny by parodying scenes from the orginal movie
. mel brooks does nto take advantage of this
,
however
,
and uses the film to launch several ideas into tghe air
, none of which connect
and none of which are explained later on
. the movie
' s scenes could be shuffled around in any order
and one would be hard pressed to notice
. cary elwes
, of princess bride fame
, plays robin of loxley
, a man who was captured in the crusades
, fighting with king richard
. he escapes
and
, joining with a man named achoo
( i am sure ytou can see the obvious joke
)
, fights in engl
and to reclaim his name
and the throne for richard
, which has been captured by evil prince john
, played by funny comic richard lewis
. he also tries for the love ofthe maid marian
and attemts to overthrow the evil
" sheriff of rottingham
"
. a good adventure plot that is sadly unused
. elwes anbd lewis are both exellent comics
,
but the dialogue in the movie isnt simply excruciating
. neither actor has any good words to work with
,
and the lines simply aren
' t funny
, nor believable
. perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone
. this parituclar scene is so out of place
and so badly acted
,
and followed by so many otehr scenes of equal miserable ideas
, taht i really felt like leaving the theatre
. much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout
, anbd some left tje theatre
. chuckles were few
and far between
,
and they mostly dealed wtih visual jokes
( such as an old
, beaten up horse from
" rent
- a
- wreck
"
)
then from any dialogue whatsoever
. scenes that could haev been classics
, such as the archery contest
, are ruined by poor acting
. perhaps the largest problem with the movei is that it is simply offensive
. the basic plot
, that robin has received a key thast will unlock the chastity bilt ofthe maid marian
, is not witty nor funny
. mel brooks as a circumcision
- giving rabbi is also offensive to me
and others inspite the audiance
( not all jewish
, either
)
. the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny
and by
and large fails
. tghe addition of a blind man who stumbles around
, falling off cliffs
, walking into ledges
and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential
,
but is also made terribly offensive
. the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard
. he is well worth waiting for
, if you can st
and an hour
and half of unfunny dialogue
, excruciating visual humor
, old puns
, ancient jokes
and bad acting
. if ytou can
' t
, don
' t even bother watching this miserable film
.
