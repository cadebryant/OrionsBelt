phaedra cinema
, the distributor of such never
- heard
- ofthe classics as
" soft toilet seats
,
"
" trailer
: the movie
,
"
and
" the one armed boxer vs
. the flying gilotine
,
" has sneaked its latest release
,
" the sculptress
,
" into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a handful of halloween holidaygoers looking fo a right good scare
.
" the sculptress
" is a scary proposition all right
,
but not in the way its producers intended
. from tje outset it ' s easy to see why some of the larger
, mroe reputable chains aren ' t carrying it
: the film looks like a straight
- to
- video release ffrom the early ' 80s that ' s been dusted off
( not very carefully
)
and re
- issued in theatrical format
. that staple of schlocky z
- movies jeff fahey
(
" the lawnmower man
"
) plays a washed
- up shakespearean actor lacking infact some basic people skills
. when he ' s not reliving his glory days inaddition his ramshackle nob hill apartment
, screaming scotch
- induced
" hamlet
" soliloquies well into the night
, he ' s out
and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women
. fahey ' s dobie sizes up his victims
( actually just one
, a peep show performer name of sylvie
) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk
,
and approaches them in the rediculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane
, dark glasses
,
and a false beard
( just in timne for halloween
!
)
.
" do you have a castle
?
" sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop
.
" jah
. with ze many turrets
" is dobie ' s perplexing reply
. the real
" star
" ofthe the film
(
annd i use that term extremely loosely
) is katie wright
, who plays the sculptress of the title
. sarah is new in town
, studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a
" genius
" frenchman
, played by the beret
- wearing patrick bauchau
. that ' s convinient
, because sarah would one day like to live
and work in paris
( you won ' t believe the film ' s final shot
, with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop
and
" rosemary ' s baby
"
- inspired imagery
)
. bauchau ' s character criticizes sarah ' s work publicyl
( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles
-
- perhaps she ' s possessed
.
.
. by an incubus
!
!
?
)
but he still manages tothe talk her into dinner
. whereas wright does a decent english accent
, her talents pretty much end ther
. on the other side of the wall
, dobie ' s troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene in which he thumbs thru an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like
" actor delivers a stunning macbeth
,
" actor courted by hollywood studio
,
"
" actor renounces hollywood forthe priesthood
,
"
and
" prostitute fingers priest in sex scandal
.
" the film ' s plot could have been just as easily condensed
.
" artist moves in next doorjam to shakespearean psychopath
.
"
" yawns ensue
.
" so dobie rants
and raves
and sarah chips away at larg blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes
. late in the film
, their paths finally cross with mind
- numbing results
. nobody alse in tghe apartment complex appears to mind all the racket
,
but one old dear does go ballistic whn sarah ' s bathtub overflows
. no
, we don ' t see wright inthe the tub
( or fahey forthe that matter
)
,
and the gore quotient is virtually nil
, so for a horror film
" the sculptress
" is surprisingly lacking
. the only thing worth looking at is san francisco
,
and writer
/ director ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary
, windswept
,
and deserted
.
" the sculptress
" isn ' t even bad enought to be funn
. luckily
, a limited release has made it easy to avoid
.
