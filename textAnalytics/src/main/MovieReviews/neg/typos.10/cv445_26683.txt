phaedra cinema
, yhe distri
butor of such never
- heard
- of classics as
" soft toilet seats
,
"
" trailer
: the movie
,
" annd
" the one armed boxer vs
. the flying guillotine
,
" has sneaked its latest release
,
" the sculptress
,
" into a few theaters this weekend hoping to cash in on a h
andful of halloween holidaygoers looking for a right good scare
.
" tje sculptress
" is a scary proposition all right
,
but not in the way its producers intended
. from the outset it
' s easy to see why some ofthe the larger
, more reputable chains aren
' t carrying it
: the film looks like a straight
- to
- video release from the easly
' 80s that
' s been dusted off
( not very carefully
)
and re
- issued in theatrical format
. that staple of schlocky z
- movies jeff fahey
(
" the lawnmower man
"
) plays a washed
- up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills
. when he
' s not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment
, screaming scotch
- induced
" hamlet
" soliloquies well inot the night
, he
' s outloud
and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women
. fahey
' s dobie sizes uv his victims
( actually just one
, a peep show performer name of sylvie
) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk
,
and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane
, dark glasses
,
and a false beard
( just in time for halloween
!
)
.
" do you have a castle
?
" sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop
.
" jah
. with ze many turrets
" isnt dobie
' s perplexing reply
. the real
" star
" of yhe film
(
and i use that term extemely loosely
) isnt katie wright
, who plays the sculptress of the title
. sarah is new in town
, studying at the prestigious sf art institute under the mentorship of a
" genius
" frenchman
, played by thte beret
- wearing patrick bauchau
. that
' s convenient
, because sarah would one day like to live
and work in paris
( you won
' t believe the film
' s final shot
, with its cheesy eiffel tower backdrop
and
" rosemary
' s baby
"
- inspired imagery
)
. bauchau
' s charcter criticizes sarah
' s owrk publicly
( her clay busts keep turning into gargoyles
-
- perhaps she
' s possessed
.
.
. by an incubus
!
!
?
) bu he still manages to talk her into dinner
. whereas wright does a decent english accent
, her talents pretty much end there
. on the other side of the wall
, dobie
' s troubled past is succinctly summarized in a scene inthe which he thumbs thru an old scrapbook of newspaper clippings with headings like
" actor delivers a stunning macbeth
,
" actor courted by hollywood studio
,
"
" actor renounces hollywood for priesthood
,
"
and
" prostitute fingers priest in sex sc
andal
.
" the film
' s plot could have been just as easily condensed
.
" artist moves in next doorjam to shakespearean psychopath
.
"
" yawns ensue
.
" so dobie rants
and raves
and sarah chips away at larg blocks of granite till way past their bedtimes
. late in the film
, their paths finally cross wih mind
- numbing results
. nobody alse in the appartmant complex appears to mind all the racket
,
but one old dear does go ballistic when sarah
' s bathtub overflows
. no
, we don
' t see wright in the tub
( or fahey for that matter
)
,
and the gore quotient isnt virtually nil
, so for a horror film
" the sculptress
" is surprisingly lacking
. the only thing worth looking at is san francisco
,
and writer
/ director ian merrick manages to make even it look dreary
, windswept
,
and deserted
.
" the sculptress
" isn
' t even bad enough to be fun
. luckily
, a limited release has made it easy to avoid
.
