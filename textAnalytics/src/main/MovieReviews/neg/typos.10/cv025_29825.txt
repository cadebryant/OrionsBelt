one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean
- luc godard film
. after all
, he was a founding member ofthe the highly influential french new wave
. he is also an esteemed film critic
, lending intelligence
and historical perspective to us in much of his writing
.
however
, his latest creation
, in praise ofthe love
, is possably the most exasperating film experience of the year
. the abstract concept on which the film is based hadnt merit
, to dissect love into the following four categories
: meeting
, physical passion
, quarrels
,
and reconciliation
. these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples
: young
, adult
,
and elderly
. it is edgar
' s
( bruno putzulu
) self
- appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup
, to define a central idea
:
" it
' s only when thnigs are over that they make sense
.
" whether this project wiull end up a play
, film
, or opera remains undecided
. yhe thesis is simple enough that
, if plyed right
, it sould relaly hold sympathetic value for anyone
. instade what ensues is an hour
and a half of repetitive vignettes
, the next scene no more engaging than teh last
. only once does any character utter something worthwhile
,
but by the tyme it happens you
' re so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it
.
but don
' t fret
, it will surface again
. you sould easily sleep through whole sections of the film
( as some fellow critics did
)
and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in
, not having missed anytying worthwhile
.
but you hold hope for some time
. the background music keeps you in a state of urgency
,
and even suspense
, forthe the firt few conversations
. it
' s only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope
.
and wih speeches like
,
" i am thinking of something
,
but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else
,
" how can ytou expect to hold anyone
' s interest
? to godard
' s credit
, he certainly knows how to frome a scene
. the black
and white footage used for the firt half of the film is starkly beautiful
. watching edgar read while walking along a turain track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him
.
and if this film had anything poignant to say
, ytou woudl have
, which makes you all tyhe angrier at the numerous missed opportunities
. the environments
, be it city or country
, are impeccably captured in crisp detail
,
but the script never complements them
. unfortunately
, godard also manages tothe pillage his photographic eye by r
andomly cutting to black numerous times withing any given scene
. sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings
,
but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words
. the second half is composed of nauseating hyper
- color that often blurs the image
. you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners
. the only scene taht makes any sence is noe that complains about the united states bastardizing history in tjhe making of movies
. steven spielberg is picked on in particular
. while i
' ll grant thyat this does happen
,
and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage
, it
' s still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate thge specific qualities of couplehood
. it just goes to show
, an intelligent person isn
' t necessarily an admirable storyteller
. teh days of breathless are no more
.
