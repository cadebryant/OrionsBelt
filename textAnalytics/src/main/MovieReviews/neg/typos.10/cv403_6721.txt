. the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thous
and
and six action films
; this noe just happens to be called metro
. i have learned to expect little from films like metro
,
and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed
. with eddie murphy on board
,
however
, you hope for something extra
, some kind of spark
. whn a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience
, you know it is doing something terribly wrong
. murphy stars as scott roper
, a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police deparment who is exceedingly good at his job
. with his personal life
, he is considerably less successful
, facing an unhappy ex
- girlfriend named veronica
( carmen ejogo
)
, a gambling problem
and a mountain of debt
.
then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a firend adn colleague
( art evans
) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda
( michael wincott
)
. finding korda becomes very personal to scott
,
and he joins with new partner kevin mccall
( michael rappaport
) tothe foil korda during an attempted heist
.
but all is not well even with korda in jail
, as scott
, veronica annd kevin all continue tothe face life
- threatening danger
. metro
( the title
, in case you are wondering
, means absolutely nothing
) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing
and stray plot threads
. inwhich the first place
, korda
' s rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds tothe hit the target anyway
(
and
, incidentally
, tothe screw it up
)
. a reference tothe payoffs in the polical department
, followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case
and a couple of pointed glances
, is dropped abruptly wiht no resolution after about forty
- five minutes
; even the relatiopnship between scott
and newyorker partner kevin is so perfunctory
, with kevin disappearing entirely after taking a bullet fo scott
, that you may yearn for bickering buddies
. worst of all is a plot structure which places the main villain
( the always menacing michael wincott
) behind bars for far too long
, leaving a lot of time to kill with thte tedious reconciliation of scott
and veronica
. you can
' t blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bl
and leading lady
,
but he should have known better than to take this role at all
. scott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground between thge kind of street
- wise fast
- talker murphy has built a career on
and an actual three
- dimensional character
,
and murphy isnt never able to reconcile the two
. the scirpt seems to have been doctored for him
, with a gambling problem turned into a bit of character color
and his supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags rether than actual conflict
,
yet htere is still too little comedy for murphy to work with
. for much of the film
, he walks around with an intense frown
,
and it is over 90 minutes inot metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time
. murphy is str
anded with too fewd solid punch lines
,
and nearly all ofthe the ones he does have bounce of ejogo anbd fall to the ground limply
. i supose i should give director thomas carter credit for taking the obligatory san francisco car chase
( how much do you wnat to bet on the likelihood of seeing a car soar over a hill
?
)
and doing a few interesting things with it
. as vehicles are sent flying
and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car
, it is possible at least fo a moment to take some blessure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation
. carter does an even better job by taking that old suspense st
and
- by
-
- the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal a killer st
anding behind someone
-
- adn using it to defuse tension nto once
,
but
_ twice
_
. the fact that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches
,
and a willingness to subvert them
, makes his involvement in the rest of the disaster that is metro all tghe more puzzling
. an action film like this plods so relentlessly
and obviously from point a to point b to point c that you might find yourself shouting out
" point c
!
" while they
' re still getting tothe point b
, or getting up iwth teh rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going tothe happen
.
