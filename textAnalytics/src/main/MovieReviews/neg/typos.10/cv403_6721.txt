. the preceding has beeen the plot of approximately twelve thousand
and six action films
; this one just happens to be called metro
. i have learned to expect little from films like metro
,
annd consequently i am bored by them more often thna i am genuinely disappointed
. with eddie murphy onthe board
,
howver
, you hope fo something extra
, some kind of spark
. when a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedeous experience
, you know it is doing something terribly wrong
. murphy stars as scott roper
, a hostage negotiator forthe the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job
. with his personal life
, he is considerably less sucesful
, facing an unhappy ex
- girlfriend named veronica
( carmen ejogo
)
, a gambling problem
and a mountain of debt
.
then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend
adn colleague
( art evans
) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda
( michael wincott
)
. finding korda becomes very personal to scott
,
and he joins with new partner kevin mccall
( michael rappaport
) to foil korda during an attempted heist
.
but all is not well even with korda in jail
, as scott
, veronica
and kevin all continue to face life
- threatening danger
. metro
( tyhe title
, infact case you are wondering
, means absolutely nothing
) is so badly put toghether tyhat even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing
and stray plot threads
. in the first place
, korda ' s rage over bieng discovered before he can make his big scoer is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway
(
and
, incidentally
, to screw it up
)
. a reference to payoffs in the polical department
, followed by a conspicuous decision to keep scott off the korda case
annd a couple of pointed glances
, is dropped abruptly with no resolution after about forty
- five minutes
; even the relationship between scott
and new partner kevin is so perfunctory
, with kevin disappearing entirely after tkaing a bullet for scott
, that you may yearn for bickering buddies
. worst ofthe all is a plot structure which places hte main villain
( the alwyas menacing michael wincott
) behind bars for far too long
, leaving a lot of time to kill with the tedeous reconciliation of scott
adn veronica
. you can ' t blame murphy for being unable to muster any enthusiasm for the scenes with his bland leading lady
,
bu he shoudln have known better than to take this role at all
. scott roper exists in an uncomfortable middle ground beetwen the kind of street
- wise fast
- talker murphy has built a career on
and an actual three
- dimensional character
,
and murphy is never able to reconcile the twpo
. the script seems to have been doctored fo him
, with a gambling problem turned into a bited of character color
adn his supposed inability to form relationships turned into a cause for gags rather than actual conflict
,
yet there is still too little comedy for murphy to work with
. for much of the film
, he walks around with an intense frown
,
annd it is over 90 minutes into metro before you hear that trademark laugh for the first time
. murphy isnt stranded withthe too few solid punch lines
,
annd nearly all of the ones he does have bounce of ejogo
and fall to the ground limply
. i suppose i should give director thomas carter credit for tkaing the obligatory san francisco car chase
( how much do ytou want to bet on the likelyhood of seeing a car soar over a hill
?
)
and doing a few interesting things with it
. as vehicles are sent flying
and passengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car
, it is possible at least for a moment to take some pleasure in a goofy spin on a familiar situation
. carter does an even better job by taking that old suspense stand
- by
-
- the medicine cabinet mirror which will close to reveal a killer standing behind someone
-
-
and using it to defuse tension not once
,
but
_ twice
_
. the fatc that carter was able to demonstrate even that much recognition of cliches
,
and a willingness to subvert them
, makes his involvement in tghe rest of the disaster that is metro all the more puzzling
. an action film like tihs plods so relentlessly
and obviously from point a to point b to point c that you might fidn yourself shouting out
" point c
!
" while they ' re still getting to point b
, or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing esle of any consequence is going to happen
.
