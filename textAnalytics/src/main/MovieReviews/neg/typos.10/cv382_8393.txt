possibly the years the most anticipated film
and fianlly it arrives here in the uk
. it smashed u
. s box office office records in it
' s opening weekend
and will noone doubt do the same here
.
but is it any good
? in a owrd
, no
. i
' ll elaborate further
. the story is as follows
. apparently there were two isl
ands withthe dinosaurs on
. one where thte dinos lived untouched by mankind
and the other a tourist attraction which failed before it even opened
.
( see jurrasic park
.
) imgen
, tje company that funded jurrasic park
, want to reccover thier losses by taking more dinos off the other isl
and
and move them to a new attraction in san diago
. realizing what a bad idea this is
, proffessor john hammond
( richard attenborough
) decides tothe send a team to document the dinosaurs
, so as to rally public support tothe preserve the isl
and
. enter familliar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there
. so
, basically
, what you have is this
. two teams
, one sent to catch
and move some dinosaurs to the mainl
and
and the other
, trying to doccument them
, being forced to work together
, fighting for survival against the dinosaurs
' firm intentions on eating them
. a fairly ogod idea
,
however it
' s let down by one slight problem
. it
' s crap
. over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring
, way too quiclky
. add to this a terrible script
and soem feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation
and yuo end up very disinterested
. it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like
,
' what
' s for tea
?
'
and
' should you cut the lawn later
?
'
( yes
, you should
)
. it
' s a shame
then really
, that spielberg has lowered himself into making what essentially is a blatant cash in
, which adds practically nothing to the far superior jurrasic park
. with only a fewd creative
and genuinely tense scenes
and fabulous c
. g
. i rinosarus
( hte t
. rex
' s have to be seen to be believed
)
, ther is nothing else to recommend the lost world
. a very dissapointing sequel
, indeed
.
