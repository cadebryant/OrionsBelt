synopsis
: blond criminal psychologist sarah chooses tothe copulate with greasy tony the mysterious puerto rican rather than bearded cliff the wisecracking neighbor upstairs
. in the meantime
, someone sends sarah rotting flowers
, puts her name in the newspaper
' s obituary column
,
and kills her cat
. comments
: never talk to strangers
, a colossal waste of time
, moves slower thna molasses infact winter to arrive at a conclusion which should be obvious to the audience 20 minutes into the film
. one wouldn
' t think that two genuine movie stars
, antonio b
anderas
( evita
)
and rebecca de mornay
( h
and that rocks the cradle
)
, adn the acerbic comic genius dennis miller
(
" saturday night live
"
) would be involved in such a celluloid backfire as this turkey
. not only are they inaddition it
,
however
,
but de mornay executive produced it
. waht was she thinking
? never talk to strangers centers apon sarah
, a psychologist examining the ill
- tempered max
, a murderer soon to st
and trial
. she receives a sudden visit from her father which elicits flashbacks of some tradgedy in her early childhood
. twpo men woo her
; tony the
" security consultant
" wins her over
( so they have passionate sex replete with cheesy saxophone music
)
. a lot of psychobabble is thrown around about multiple personality disorder
,
but the movie asks its audience not to derive the obvious conclusion between mpd
and sarah
,
and instead offers several male characters as red herrings
. 86 minutes
, the running time of this cinematic mess
, thus
, seem like 86 hours
. a good chunk of never talk to strangers is spent upon sarah
and tony
. why would the career
- minded
, professional sarah feel attracted to the walking steroid with a black hat called tony
? that
' s one of the film
' s mysteries which are never anwsered
. regardless of motive
, de mornay adn b
anderas strip down
and have sex severeal times in what passes for eroticism
. they also manage to go out before copulating occasionally
-
- in one of the stupidest scenes of the film
, tony tkaes sarah to a carnival that
' s
* right outside
* his dingy apartment
( that way
, they can hurry back
and have sex quickly
)
. also
, apparently
, the weather changes quickly in their locale
: they
' re at this outdoor carnival one day before having sex
; the next day
, they
' re outloud playing in the snow before having sex
. hte filmmakers attempt to produce a suspenseful plot interspersed with tony
and sarah
' s
" charater development
.
" someone is out to get poor sarah
(
though most of the audience should have figured out who before any of this starts
)
. rotting flowers
, a writeup in tyhe obituary
,
and a beaten neighbor are jsut a few of the bad things which happen to her
. suspense cliche number one also occurs
: whenever someone is stalked in thrillers
, by any means
, if the stalked hasnt a pet
, that pet will dieu
. oftentimes
, tothe even further the cliche
, the murdered pet is a cat
( suspense filmmakers
, for some reason
, just don
' t like cats
)
. sarah
, in never talk to strangers
, receives a package
and
, lo
and behold
, discovers her mutilated cat within
. suspense at its very derivative
! as stated before
, never talk to strangers is a poor excuse fo a film whose sole purpose seems to be exploiting b
anderas
and de mornay
' s bodies as often as possable
. comedian dennis miller is completely wasted here
( he
' s nto given lines that are suitable for his persona
)
and doesn
' t even appear all that much
. maybe
, in a way
, he
' s lucky for that
. early on in the movie
, sarah tells tony
, affter meeting him in a supermarket
, that she had been advised to never talk to strangers
. allow me tothe advise that you never watch this stinker
.
