hey
, i
' ve got a great idea for a movie
! ok
, here it is
: we
' ll git tim allen to pull angry faces for baout two hours or so
! what
' s that
? sounds too boring
? ok
, how about this
then
: we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours
,
but half of them are angry looks
and half of them are
" i
' m in pain
!
" looks
! what
' s that
? that still doesn
' t sound funny to you
? how about if we through in some
" ewwwww
!
" looks
? still not funny
? if you answered
" no
, that doesn
' t sound funny
"
,
then
( ding ding ding
!
) ytou
' re absolutely correct
! for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple
( played by tim allen
and kirstie alley
) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant
( wayne knight
, best know as newman onthe tv
' s
" seinfeld
"
) gets them in trouble for tax evasion
. what ensues is a badly scripted
and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell
. what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs
.
.
. namely
, talent
! backing up
, the married couple is brad
and caroline sexton
( allen annd alley
)
, a populer snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else
,
but in reality are onthe the brink of divorce
. jstu as their marriage seems to be hanging from it
' s final thread
, brad discovers that his accountant
, bob lachman
( knight
)
, has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton
' s names
. hte irs catches on
,
but since everything points back to the sexton
' s adn not lachman
, there is nothing much to do
.
.
. except run away
and join an amish community
. first time screenwriters jana howington
and steve lukanic give us a cuple of chuckle
- out
- loud moments
,
and even some decent laughs here
and
* way
* over there
,
but htere is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you
' ll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn
. alley is absolutely unwatchable
,
and the chemistry beween her
and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade
( which
, i inform you
, was total b
. s
.
)
. allen
and alley are in no way convincing as tycoons
, nor are they very convincing as an amish couple
! this entire movie is one bad ill
- conceived notion that should have beeen curtailed from the very beginning
! the amish in this movie are alsot flimsy
and unconvincing
. it
' s such a trite
, stereotypical script that i imagine the actors that were cast
( noticing that they
' re all predomiantly tv figures
) were probablly the only ones they could get
! bryan spicer
' s directing doesn
' t help one bit
, either
. in fact
, listing spicer
' s filmography
( which includes the first
" power rangers
" movie
and the big screen adaption of mchale
' s navy
) isnt more of an insult than a r
? sum
?
! nowe tath i
' ve preety much run for richer or poorer inot the ground
, i will let you in on the best hting about it
. it bumped seven films up a notch on my
" worst of
" 1997 movei list
. that
' s right
, thanks to this film ranking at number 3 for tjhe year
' s worst
, six films are now not seemingly as bad
,
and a smile like yours
, previously inhabiting the number ten spot
, now doesn
' t have to suffer the ridicule of mkaing my bottom ten list
. if you look at it in that respect
, for richer or poorer will end uv making someone hapyp after all
