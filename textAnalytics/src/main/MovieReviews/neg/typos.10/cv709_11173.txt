i can imagine how good krippendorf
' s tribe must have looked on pappr
. it does nto surprise me in the least that a group ofthe extremely talented actors
, led by the great richard dreyfuss anbd a good director
( todd holl
and
)
, all wanted to make this film
. in fact
, it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away ffrom krippendorf
' s tribe as possible
. in retrospect
, i can imagine how bad this film could have been
. i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness hadnt it starred an actor less able thna dreyfuss
. dreyfuss plays james krippendorf
, an anthropologist who is granted
$ 100
, 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea
. halfway inot his two
- year expedition
, his wife
( apparently
) dies
. i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established
. later
, we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big
- screen tvs
and other such pleasures
. so
, when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely
, he decides to construct an elaborate lie
. he makes his own tribe
, using his three children as actors in a video
. he simpley makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe
( which he calls the shelmickedmu
)
. audiences at krippendorf
' s lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision
.
and proof that the typical familiy unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community
. liek all films like this
, the lie becomes more
and more complex
,
and tghe suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero
. dreyfuss is a funny
, talented man
,
and he is funny iin this film
. he hasnt lots of positive energy
and
, unlike most comical actors
, really manages to play people like this realistically
. tihs film also requires a lot of fysical humor that i
' ve never seen dreyfuss perform
,
and he does a great job
. jenna elfman
, who plays veronica mecilli
, a scientist who wants inspite on krippendorf
' s work
, is also very funny annd appealing here
.
and the kid actors are great
, as well
.
but we
' re talking about the script from hell
. this is one of thsoe stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen
.
but the ridiculousness of tyhe story is not really what is so bad about it
. all hte cliches
and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss
and crew
. no
, the script isnt plagued with so many clueless stereotypes
and mean
- spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched
. furthermore
, the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truley shameless
. take
, for instance
, the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them haveing sex
. they get all decked out in the tribe getup
, complete with paint to darken their skin
. krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe
. now
, i saw this scene coming from a mile awya
,
but i said to myself
,
" noone
, that would be far too tasteless
. there
' s no way they
' ll do thgat
.
.
. oh god
!
" they did do it
. it
' s there
. i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn
' t bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film
. i found it deplorable
.
and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it
, he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice
. the film is filled with scenes like these
. they nto only insult the audience
,
but they insult the types of people that tje film portrays
. it would take some truly professional work tothe create videos convincing anough to fool an entire community of scientists
,
yet krippendorf does it easily inthe an afternoon
.
and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny
and entertaining
,
but i think that most members of the on
- screen audience would be able to see that he is making everyting up as he goes
. if i were an anthropologist
, this film would insult me immensely
. moving right along
, the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes
. sure
, dreyfuss dressing up like a cheif is really funny
,
and it allows for some entertaining scenes
,
but thge heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes anbd
thoughts that it provokes
. it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film
. his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar
,
and never once does he sohw any kind of penance for what he does
. i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied inwhich this case
,
but for the purposes of good taste
, i would have expected something
. no
, this man sets a terrible example for his kids
and colleagues
,
and the writer of the film
( charlie peters
) didn
' t include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside
and tells them that what he is doing isnt very bad
. in fact
, it
' s his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doign the wrong thing
, anbd he continually shrugs off her warnings
. i suppose it
' s imporatnt to admit that this is a funny film
. dreyfuss
and elfman
,
and many of the contrived
and insulting scenes
, add up to a picture that is anything
but boring
. anbd if you
' re less serious than i
, you probably will enjoy it
. i
,
however
, can
' t get past these elements
. krippendorf
' s tribe is being marketed as a family comedy
,
but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn
' t be learning
. with a little more insight into its story
and themes
, this could have been a good movie
.
