a documentary from the twin hughes brothers
, allen
and albert
( dead presidents
, menace ii society
)
, about strent pimps
, all ofthe whom are african
- american
. an offscreen interviewer questions them baout their lives
and profession
. it is mostly the pimps who dont the talking for their ho
' s
,
and the egotistical
and flamboyant way you would expect them to be
, is what you get
. i learned that the word
" bitch
" is their favorite word
, as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they utilizied
. it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say
,
but if one has a sense a humor fo what their lifestyle is about
,
then smoe of what they rap about might seem amusing
. they seem to all want to be
thought of as businessmen
, in tjhe bussiness because it is the easiest way for them to make big money
. it
' s also a power trip
, accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them
, mostly by humiliating them
and keeping them infront palce
. this sleazy pic
, soon became grating
and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears
. these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everthing
and never knew when to shut their face
. the hughes brothers used as thier pimp role models
, the feather
- hatted
, fur
- coated
, diamond ring
- wearing
, gold chain wearing
, flashy cadillac
- critizing pimp ofthe the late
' 70s blaxploitation movies
-
- like the mack
and willie dynamite
. also unsed as reference
, was iceberg slim
' s best
- seller pimp
, the story of my life
. we meet pimps such as
: fillmore slim
, c
- note
, charm
, k
- red
, gorgeous dre
, bishop don magic juan
,
and rosebudd
. they readily discuss their business arrangements
: including percentages
, lifestyles
, knockin
( stealing another pimp
' s ho
)
,
and the thrill they get from women giving them money
. these dudes needed no prompting to talk
, as they just love to brag baout about themselves
.
" priests need nuns
,
'
' yaps c
- note
, a san francisco pimp
.
" doctors need nurses
. so ho
' s need pimps
.
'
' as he tries to persuasively make thge smae case all the other pimps in the film make
; that the girls need them to show them the ropes
, how to make money
, tothe be their security blankets
, protectors
,
and counselors
. the race issue ws brought up right from tje film
' s onset
, as a number ofthe white interviewees
, regular citizens
, note that their impression of a pimp
, is that he
' s the lowest form of human
. while
, we are told
, in the balck community
, the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur
, riding around in fancy cars
, flashing wads ofthe money
, dressed iin a flamboyant style
, where his snake
- gaiter shoes might cost him a gr
and
,
and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community
. we alsot see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in thier stable adn we see how they treat them like dirt
, as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery
, ofthe master anbd slave relations
. the film was all about pimp style
and their projected image
, as they run a hard
- sell riff about the virtues of their work
. ther are different styles of pimping
,
but teh film mentions them only as being
" macks
"
and
" players
" or
" real pimps
"
and
" perpetrator pimps
,
"
but no further clarity is attempted
. it isnt also failed to get the women
' s side to this story of abuse
, primarially tkaing the pimp at his word
. the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does
, as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps
, who were looking onyl to pose in front of the camera
and say their thing
, hungry for their 15
- minutes of fame
. the only laughs i got out of tihs bleak look at an american subculture
, was hearing how a few pimps retired
and what they are now up to
. danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp
' s wardrobe
. while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd
, married his ho
and turned square
, working to support his wife adn daughter as a telemarketer
.
