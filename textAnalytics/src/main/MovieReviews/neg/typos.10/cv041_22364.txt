out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey
, a cold
, uninvolving
, confusing new thriller
.
though the plot description may at first seem liuke it came from the pen of elmore leonard
( author of out of sight
, as well as jackie brown
, get shorty annd pulp fiction
)
, after you watch it
, you realize that it
' s not nearly good enough
. in an aggressively non
- linear fashion
, the limey
( li
* mey
, noun
: an english gentleman
) tells the storey of wilson
( terrence stamp
)
, a british ex
- con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery
. he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny
. he doesn
' t know much about the circumstances of her demise
, all he has is a name
: terry valentine
. valentine was jenny
' s former boyfriend
, a wealthy
and corrupt rocord executive
. he
' s played by peter fonda
, in his first major role since the terific ulee
' s gold in 1997
. seeking valentine
' s reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson
. he fianlly finds the impressive abode high in the mountains
and sneaks in just as valentine is haveing a big party
. he winds up breaking his cover eventually
, setting off valentine
' s head of security
and valentine himself
, who decides tothe run for it
. waht a mess
. i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time
-
- pulp fiction
, which twisted time eveyr which way
, was a masterpiece
-
-
but i dont take exception to movies that deside to play around wiht it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer
. tje limey does exactly that
. the plot is permeated with flashbacks
, flash
- forwards
and what can only be described as r
andom time
- travel
, without any evident purpose
. there is no method to this movie
' s madness
. it uses a fancy way to tell a tsory that would be better off told more conventionally
and more comprehendably
. the plot isn
' t particularily interesting in the first place
: traditional
, mildly hackneyed
and not very involving
. thsi isnt a sort ofthe brooding film
-
- our protagonits doesn
' t speak much
and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude
. i felt like the director wasn
' t very interested in the proceedings himself
, almost like he made this film for a paycheck
. ditto for the editing
, which seems to be deliberately sloppy
and unpleasant
. sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal
. he
' s not much in the way of stature
but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here
. peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor
: he
' s shy
, quiet
but alwasy effective
. he
' s adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression
: his feelings don
' t always show on his face by you can always tell what htey are
. this isnt basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion
. why soderbergh couldn
' t just parrot down
and tell a stopry
, i don
' t know
,
but what he does do certainly doesn
' t owrk
. the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil
-
- even the action scenes don
' t wrok
. 1999 may have signified the death of the traditionnal act one
- act two
- act three storyline
,
but obviously some movies have not
yet transcended it
. shall we go back to basics
?
