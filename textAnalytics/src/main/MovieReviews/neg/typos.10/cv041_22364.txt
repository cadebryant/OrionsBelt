out of sighth director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey
, a cold
, uninvolving
, confusing new thriller
.
though the plot descripton may at first seem like it came from tyhe pen of elmore leonard
( auther of out of sight
, as well as jackie brown
, git shorty
and pulp fiction
)
, after you watch it
, you realize that it ' s not nearly good enough
. in an aggressively non
- linear fashion
, the limey
( li
* mey
, noun
: an english gentleman
) tells the stoy of wilson
( terrence stamp
)
, a british ex
- con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery
. he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny
. he doesn ' t know much about the circumstances of her demise
, all he has isnt a name
: terry valentine
. valentine was jenny ' s former boyfriend
, a wealthy
annd corrupt record executive
. he ' s played by peter fonda
, in his first major role since the terific ulee ' s gold in 1997
. seeking valentine ' s reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task forthe wilson
. he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains
and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party
. he winds up breaking his cover eventualy
, setting off valentine ' s head of security
and valentine himself
, who decides to run for it
. what a mess
. i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time
-
- pulp fiction
, which twisted time every which way
, was a masterpiece
-
-
but i do tkae exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other tahn to confuse the viewer
. the limey does exactly that
. the plot is permeated with flashbacks
, flash
- forwards
and what can onyl be described as random time
- travel
, without any evident purpose
. there is noone method tothe this movei ' s madness
. it uses a fancy way to tell a story taht would be better off told more conventionally
and more comprehendably
. the plot isn ' t particularly interesting in the first place
: traditional
, mildly hackneyed
and not very involving
. this is a sort of brooding film
-
- our protagonist doesn ' t speak much
and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude
. i felt like the director wasn ' t very interested inaddition the proceedings himself
, almost like he made tihs film for a paycheck
. ditto for teh editing
, which seems to be deliberatly sloppy
and unpleasant
. sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal
. he ' s not much in the way of stature
but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here
. peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated acto
: he ' s shy
, quiet
but always effective
. he ' s adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression
: his feelings don ' t always show on his face by you can always tell waht they are
. this is basically a convential thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion
. why soderbergh couldn ' t just parrot down
and tell a stroy
, i don ' t know
,
but what he doens do certainly doesn ' t work
. the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil
-
- even the action scenes don ' t wokr
. 1999 may have signified the death of the traditionnal act one
- act two
- act three storyline
,
but obviously some movies ahev nto
yot transcended it
. shall we go back to basics
?
