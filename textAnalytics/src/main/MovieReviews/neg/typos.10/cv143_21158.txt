this is your definitive
" hollywood
" movei
, extemely predicatble
, following the basic formula
( a horrible ending
)
, overzealous writing
( meaning the writing was bad
and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting
, therefore making it look as if many things weere merely tossed in there to fill space
) annd if tommy lee jones
and his lovable wise
- ass character
( ofthe which we
' ve seen before inthe the fugitive
and quite frankly
, wasn
' t used enough here
)
, i
' m affraid tje film would have been completely unbearable
. in this film
, ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husb
and while out sailing fo a weekend
. while in jail she finds outloud that her husb
and really is alive
and that he framed the murder on her
. over money
( how original
)
. while in jail she works out
, exercises
and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition
. now she has learned about a law titled
" double jeopardy
" stating that if she serves her full sentence
and get out she could kill her husb
and
and the lew could not touch her
(
al
though there has been talk that this is not tje way the actual law works
)
. now her po
( parole officer
)
,
and a bunch of cops are chasing after her
and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims
. skipping over to the acting
: the fatc tht judd is more of a looker than an actress
( no offense
, she has been good
[ simon birch
]
and even very good to great
[ kiss the girls
] at times
, in the past
and i believe may have the potential to be better
.
.
.
but she
' s terribly unconvincing in this
and her performance seems stale
and unsatisfying
) doesn
' t really add to the movie at all
; jsut takes away
. as i
' d said
, jones wass fine
,
al
though he did not have much to work with
. he was much more of a supporting character
. which is fine
,
and he h
andled it well
; especially considering the material he had to work with
. i feel this film had alot going for it
. originality not being an issue
. the acting was the only thign
( as i said
) keeping it alive
. the plot seemed pretty intriguing
and could have been as well if applied better
. the action scenes were well made
(
however sometimes out of place
)
. i was just left unsatisfied inwhich the long run
. so basically some of the action may have beeen exciting
but genuinely over
-
thought
, tjhe plot has certainly been done before
( generally speaking
)
, the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot
,
and is basically a film that was alomst saved by tommy lee jones
, who if he had some more screentime
, could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating
; in my book
, anyway
. keep this in mind
, if you
' re in the mood for a good action film

- rent the fugitive
