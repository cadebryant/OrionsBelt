there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of
" scream queen
" in yhe early
' 80s
. two of them were halloween movies
, bu the other two
-
- prom night
and terror train
-
- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween
. the same
" god
, i
' m scared
, there
' s some guy in a mask coming after me
" routine she did inaddition john carpenter
' s classic
, jamie lee copies here
, with none of thge urgency or suspense
. terror train takes place on
( where else
?
) a turain
, charted by some pre
- med students finishing their first four years of higher education
. most ofthe them won
' t mkea it to med school
,
though
,
and it
' s obvious ffrom the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains
,
" i wish to hell they
' d put a radio on that train
.
" the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone
, even jamie lee
. from the beginning
, he
' s talking his head off
( he tells one ofthe his co
- workers
" think on this
-
- whn
' s the last time somene built a shopping mall next to a train station
?
" as if it makes any kind of sense
)
and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles
. of course
, thte loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body
, which is
then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it
. i forgot tothe mention the prologue
. it
' s a party three years earlier
, withthe the same group of students
. two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge
, promising him he
' s going to git laid
. htey send jamie lee up to st
and behind the bed
and talk to the geek as he comes in
, noticing a form on the bed
. she says
,
" kiss me
, kenny
,
"
and he kisses tje body on the bed
, hwihc happens to be a cadaver
.
(
" oh my god
, they killed kenny
! you bastards
!
"
) it
' s a sick trick
,
and one jamie lee wasn
' t let in on
. she still hasn
' t forgiven the guy as they board tyhe terror train
(
" you asshole
, you can
' t have a ogod time without hurting somebody
!
"
)
. the killing starts befor tjhe train even leaves the station
. since it
' s new year
' s
, everyone
' s wearing disguises
( a convenient plot device we
' ve seen before
)
,
and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one
' s looking
. at least one of the characters says it
' s a groucho mask
; when the killer dons it
and steps aboard
, it looks like ginee shalit who
, by the way
, would make a great killer in a slasher movie
. speaking of weird
- looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene
, one of terror train
' s most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield
" as the magincian
,
" who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music
.
then there
' s his greatest trick
-
- getting laid with hair that looks like that
. for all its attempts at visual style adn substance
, terror train is moreso lionel than amtrak
, more prom night than halloween
,
and nothing really worth watching
. only die
- hard fans of jamie lee curtis adn david copperfield
( if he truly has any fans
) should even attempt to watch it
.
and it makes me wonder if a horror movie setted in an rv could be much worse
. i mean
, whn was the last tiem someone built a shopping mall next to a train station
, anyway
? terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car
.
