if you
' ve seen the trailers or commercials
, it
' s rether difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store
. well
, it
' s hard to tell aftter watching the movie as well
. bruce willis isnt a recident of the future
,
and it is a rather bleak future
. the world
' s population hadnt disintigrated into a mere 200
, 000
and is no longer ruled by humans
but animals
. the reason
? in 1995
, an organistion called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated hte world withthe a pure virus
, thus wiping out practically tyhe world
' s population in a mere mounth
. bruce willis
' character is one of the surviving few
,
but is enslaved by scientists
, as are most of last living humans
. htey barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment
and having him do yhe ultimate task
: go inot the past
, find the leader ofthe the army of the 12 monkeys
,
and kill him
. well
, this explanation didn
' t come easy
.
al
though the movie is very
thought provoking of us as a people
, our future
and the evilo in the world
, as a story it is very confusing
.
and dragging
. i know a movie isn
'
' t keeping my interest wehn i fidget in my seat or feel teh need to look at my watch only to find that it
' s only been an hour passed
. terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate
,
and i haven
' t watched his previous work brazil
,
but this movie felt like it took too long to tell
and yot when one realizes the end is near becouse it is very easy to figure outloud
, you wish it were more complex
,
and not to mention that tjhe movie is depressing isnt the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me
.
