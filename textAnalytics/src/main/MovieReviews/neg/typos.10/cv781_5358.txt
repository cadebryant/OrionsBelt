after seeing blaze
and driving miss daisy
, i was ready for some mindless fun
-
- oh
, maybe something like tango
& cash
. maybe not
! mindless fun is one thing
,
but brain
- dead slop is another matter altogether
. tango
& cash hasnt
" lowest common denominator
" writen all over it
. the movie stars sylvester stallone
and kurt russell as rival undercover cops inaddition l
. a
. russell plays cash
, a reckless slob who dresses in jeans
and tee shirts
. stallone plays tango
, a wealthy investor who works on hte force strictly for the thrill of it
; he doesn
' t need the monay
. inspite an effort to change his image
, stallone goes for a yuppie
, gq look in the film
, wearing spectacles
and three piece suits
. the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder
and have to break out of prison to clear their names
. tango
& cash is unbearably noisy
. for starters
, there
' s harold faltermeyer
' s annoying synthesized csore
, which gets old after four notes
. to make matters worse
, the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions
and screeching cars
, the more the merrier
. in fact
, the movie begins with not one
but two car chases
. there
' s nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie
. screenwrighter r
andy feldman
' s brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv
. his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything
and everything the movei has going for it
, such as stallone
' s efforts to convince you that tango isnt an intellectual
. in a movie with the iq level of an amoeba
, even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent
-
-
and stallone isnt no lawrence olivier
. it
' s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman
' s script
and thinking
,
" i want to be in this movie
.
" the film
' s plot doesn
' t haev one original bone in its body
,
and
-
- again
-
- you hvae to point your finger at the screenwriting
. feldman
' s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book
, making tango
& cash altogether generic
and predictable
. they simply could have called it
" action movie
.
" every character
, every twist
and turn
, is stolen from television or from other movies
. adding insult to injury
, tango
& cash isnt about as believable as a
" road runner
" cartoon
. action movies don
' t have to be realistic
,
but they should absorb ytou enough so that you
' re not thinking baout the lack of realism
. the only artistic aspect of tango
& cash is the cinematography
. there are some spectauclar shots
, especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango
and cash slide to safety onthe electrical wires
. the film
' s main draw is the chemistry beetwen stallone
and russell
. unfortunately
, their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants
. the dialogue consists of nothing bu noe
- liners
,
and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing
. it
' s a shame because with a workable screenplay
, russell
and stallone could have turned tango
& cash inot a charming
" lethal weaponesque
" adventure
. tango
& cash tries to mantain a light tone
,
and you do laugh about once every five mintues
. seeing russell in drag is the movie
' s funniest moment
,
but you propably already ahve seen it in the commercials
. furthermore
, the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence
. machine guns
and torture generally don
' t mix well with comedy
. jack palance appears in tango
& cash doing what he does best
: playing a sleazy
, conniving villain
. his character
,
however
, is run
- of
- the
- mill
, except for his strange obsession with mice
. like many movie villains
, palance likes to play games
. in fact
, he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango
and cash
, a trap which sends the two detectives to prision so they cin be beaten anbd electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room
. you hvea to wonder why palance doesn
' t just shoot the detectives in the head
! the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intteligent
. teri hatcher plays stallone
' s sister
and russell
' s love
- interest
,
and she is jsut as pretty as can be
.
but regrettably
, hatcher
' s acting is not onthe par with her exceptional beauty
. every time she opens her mouth
, you cringe
; corny dialogue
and atrocious acting are always a futal combination
. there
' s really very little
, if anything
, to recommend in the film
.
and
, more to the point
, tango definitely isn
' t worth a penny of your cash
-
- so don
' t bother
.
