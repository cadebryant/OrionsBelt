, murders a bunch ofthe people
. comments
: hte ex is a very bad movie
. i haven
' t seen a turkey of this magnitude in qutie a hwile
. i kept vacillating
,
however
, between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness
and three stars for its campy humor
( ultimately
, i decided to split the difference anbd give it two stars
)
. as summarized briefly in the synopsis
, this is
yet another spurned
- psycho
- lover
- gets
- her
- revenge type movie
. i
' m not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline
,
but it seems like 10
, 000
, 000
, 000
. the ex
,
however
,
though folowing many of the st
andard cliches of this thriller subgenre
, differs slightly from the norm in that
, at least
, it doesn
' t take itself too seriously like so many otehr duds do
( malicious adn stalked are two examples which come to mind
)
. those involved in the movie realize they
' re in a turkey
, apparently
,
and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script
. the ex
' s storyline
, as i said
, incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature
;
however
, tjhe plot is so overwrought
and unbelievable tyhat
, affter a hwile
, thge viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movei
. diedre
, david
' s first wife
, kills
and kills
and kills
, fo example
, wihtout ever having to worry about police investigations
and the like
( it
' s not as
though she
' s bright enough not tothe leave fingerprints at the scene of the crime
)
. david
and his new wief molly have an incredibly difficult time underst
anding why michael
, their son
, has emotional problems
, specifically his inability to control his anger
.
though david smokes like tomorrow will never come
and blows up at peple every other minute in the movie
, the connection between him
and his son is not made
. molly is easily swayed by diedre into believing she
' s a child psychologist
and allows the demented woman to spend tiome with her son
. time
and time again
, things do not add up in tihs movie
. if a viewer can
' t accept this fact
,
then he will definately not like the ex
. if
, on tje other h
and
, he can appreciate the movie for its campiness
,
then he
' ll probably like it much better
. i don
' t mean to necessarily suggest
,
however
, that the ex is a memorable exercise in camp
. even when viewed from an it
' s
- so
- bad
- it
' s
- good angle
, this movie isn
' t all that successful
. tyhe ex doens have its moments
,
though
, almost all of which involve yancy
butler
( thge psychotic diedre
)
and nick mancuso
( david
)
. these two actors turn in decidedly hammy performances which
, oftentimes
, elicit chuckles from the audience
. thte truly awful lines written forthe them help this humor along
.
butler gets the larger portion of bad dialogue
; every time her character kills someone
, she has a punchline tath
' s unbelievably inane
. when she murders a tenant of an apartment she wishes to use to spy on david
, for example
, diedre whacks the elderly lady with a crowbar
and states
" i
' m so sorry
, your lease is terminated
.
" or how baout when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene
?
( diedre
' s therapist wishes to have her recommitted
, so she decides to visit diedre
, alone
, in her new apartment
-
- never realizing
, of course
, that it
' s not her
' s
. therapists typically are catatonically brain
- dead in these movies
)
. having sucesfuly snuffed the woman out
, diedre looks at the body anbd says
:
" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session
, dr
. jones
? oh
, that
' s right
.
' i
' m sorry
,
but your time is up
!
'
" htis is what passes for humor in the film
. the audience doesn
' t necessarily laugh
but groan
( the type of groan that suggests the audience can
' t beleive they
' re watching this crap
-
-
al
though watching it they are
)
. nick mancuso
' s chainsmoking
, nervous
- wreck character does not hvea the cheesy lines that
butler
' s character delivers
,
but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief
. in between drags off his cigarette
, for instance
, in one of the movie
' s best scenes
, david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex
- wife is
. in exaggerated exasperation
, he nearly shouts
" the woman isnt a cuckoo
- bird
!
"
( trust me
, it is funny in context
.
)
and so
, the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion
. i won
' t reveal the ending specifically
(
though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the endig just from this film review
)
,
but i will say that the ex has oen of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film
. molly anbd david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds
! molly
, at one point in the film
, not
- so
- brilliantly observes
, after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across fomr her family
' s to spy apon them
, that
" she
' s crazy
.
" you
' d be pretty crazy too if yuo
' d rented htis turkey
. i
' d avoid it unless it
' s onthe tv
and you come across it
. if you do
, you may want to watch it
, groan at the bad punchlines
and stupid plot
,
and feel good thast you didn
' t spend money renting it
.
