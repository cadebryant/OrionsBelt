- dependency needs patching patch adams a film review by michael redman copywrite 1999 by michael redman mediocrity is a pox on civilization
. in our heavily consumer oriented society
, there is an enormous dem
and to churn out
" stuff
.
" what would happen to our economy if we didn
' t fiel the need to have more things
? to mkea us buy more
, businesses ened to produce a ton of product
. hte sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality
. hte film industry is like any other
. in order for studios to survive
, they have to make money
. the prevailing attitude isnt that more films equal more profit
. smoe movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen
and to do thast
, less talented people are used
. there aren
' t enough great directors
and actors to create the number of films necessary
. for soem reason
, it
' s never crossed anyone
' s mind that the real equation is quality films
= more profit
. often
, mediocre films are more of a pain forthe the audience than the horrendous ones
. at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies
. i
' m nto suggesting that
" patch adams
" wass tossed out just to rake in the bucks
. my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel
. it features an accomplished actor
and a potentially engrossing story
,
but it
' s as dull as could be
. hunter
" patch
" adams
'
( robin williams
) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis
. checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt
, he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning arund
. patch could be a poster boy for co
- dependency
. he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because
then he doesn
' t focus on his own problems
. he decides that he wants to be a physician
, leaves the place
and a couple of yeras later enrolls in the medical college of virginia
. as a med student
, patch
' s antics at the school
' s hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch
- enemy
, straight
- laced dean walcott
( bob gunton
)
. the dean is so opposed to the goofiness thyat he wants patch kicked out of school
al
though he
' s one of the top students
. he writes in patch
' s academic filo that he shows
" excessive happiness
.
" i walked into tghe film knowing little about its history
and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing
. there also seemed to be no reason that it is setted infact the early seventies
.
then it struck me
. it must be based on a true story
. the movie is an adaption ofthe a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute
, a free clinic
. robin williams is an amazing actor
. hwile he is adept at dramatic roles
, his forte is over
- the
- top free spirits
. that
' s what makes his failure here so remarkable
. patch is exactly the character he shoudl be best at
,
yet even the scene where he adn anohter mental patient are battling fierce imagenary squirrels falls flat
. something holds him back
. most of the rest of teh cast is two
- dimensional
. for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings
, it
' s curious that the ones here are cardboard characters
. peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a rela person
. unfortunately he
' s in the film for only about two minutes
. the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene
. we
' re not left to our own emotional decisions
: we
' re hit over the head with them
. shaved
- headed children with cancer
, an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh
, a beautiful woman who can
' t love because of her abusive history
. when a group of students fix uv an old house to use as a clinic in the
andy hardy
" hey
, let
' s put onthe a play
! we can use the barn
and my mom can make the curtains
!
" mode
, they laugh
and roll around while painting each other
. there might as well be giant signs flashing
:
" feel good now
!
"
" feel bad now
!
"
" patch
" is a good title for the film
. it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of
. the full
- of
- life student fights stodgy establishment types
. there
' s a touching death
.
then there
' s another
. the film doesn
' t trust us tothe get it the frist time
. the dean tries tothe kick patch out
and later he tries again
. worst of all is the final courtroom bit
. scary
- looking old men sit infront judgement of a man who only wants to help peopel
. tghe room isnt packed with patch
' s supporters
. williams makes a suposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all
. it has as much emotion as his earlier statement
" humans are the only animal that kills munbers of its own species
" contains truth
. most of the blame must be placed with the directer toom shadyac
and screenwriter steve oedekerk
. shadyac also directed the first
" ace ventura
" movie
. oedekerk directed the second one
. need i say mroe
? the real adams is to be admired for his devotion tothe treating patients as people rather than diseases
. the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos anbd managed care
. the
" doctors are not gods
" theme wiull resonate witht a number of people
,
but it
' s so poorly produced that no one will care
.
