tim robbins
and martin lawernce team up in this road movie comedy
. robbins plays an exec who discovers his wife having sex with his boss
. he goes into depression
,
and drives around his neighbourhood until he arrives inside the usual ' ghetto ' side ofthe every american city
. htere
, lawernce attempts to steal his car
,
but to no avail
,
and is dragged along with robbin ' s on a trip to arizona
. there
, they hold up a store
, are mistaken for two other robbers
( just like in my cousin vinny
)
and are chased by the police
,
anbd the other robbers
. of course
, there ' s gags along the way
, usally from lawernce
.
altough the film is midly funny
,
and quite watchable
, there ' s something so horribly familiar about it all
. this film should really be called beverly hills midnight run there ' s lawernce with his wisecracking
and heavy profanity
, jstu like eddie murphy in beverly hills cop
,
and pratically the same idea as midnight run
. it ' s full of all the road movie cliches
,
and even has a ' comedy ' car chase
, which just seemed so eighties
. even the credit sequence seemed to be out of a steve martin
, or chevy chase
, eighties comedy
. there also isn ' t much chemistry between robbins
and lawernce
. in planes
, trains
and automobiles
, there was rela chemistry between steve martin
and john candy
. in nothing to loose
, there is hardly chemistry at all
. towards the end the chemistry seems to work
,
but for the bulk of the film
, there is hardly any
, the directer directs the film in a workman like fashion
,
but gets the jokes across
.
and
although there is no chemistry between the twpo leads
, tehy give good performances on their own
. lawerence gives a good eddie murphy performence
,
and robbin ' s is alright aswell
.
however
, robbin ' s performance is nowhere near as good as tje characters he plyed in jacob ' s ladder
,
and the player
. in fact
, if you watn to see robbin ' s do comedy much better than in nothing to lose
, i suggest you rent outloud the hudsucker proxy
, where he is much funnier
. nothing to lose does have some funny moments in it
,
however
. tghe humour isn ' t particulary suffisticated
,
but if you enojyed dumb
& dumber
, you might enjoy this
. the characters in arizona are funny
,
and there ' s also a good scene where robbin ' s asks a shopkeeper which ' threatening approach ' was better
, lawerences
( which consisted of lawerence threatening to shoot the shopkeeper ' s ass
,
and swearing a lot
)
, or himselfs
,
( which was speaking in a deep
, scary voice
)
but the gags are predictable
, the lack of chemistry infurating
,
and the ending too far
- fetched
and ' perfect ' nothing to lose
then
, is robbin ' s first ' bad ' movie
(
and hopefully his last
)
,
anbd suggests that odereick shoudln twice befor making another film
. he nearly ruined carrey ' s career with ace ventura
: when nature calls
, let ' s hope he hasn ' t ruined robbin ' s
( or even lawerence ' s
) with nothing to lose
.
