if you
' re the kind of person who goes to see movies just becasue you long for soem of that overpriced theatre popcorn
(
butter optional
)
,
then thsi is the movie for you
! indeed
, htis has got to be either one ofthe the most unimaginative rip
- offs of other recent acation movies
, or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them
. it
' s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film
.
but at least we
' re warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase
, giving us an opportunity to sneak on out
and into the adjacent show
. what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movei
? first
, tyhe movie gives us an introductory premise
. huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor
, adn in this area
, many ships have disappeared
. oooh
.
.
. scary
! secondly
, a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery
,
but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical scoer
. third
, the main chracter is a mercenary thta delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo
( treat williams
)
. he operates a sophisticated military
- style pt boat
and every owrd that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy
. finally
, in the cargo hold
, we see those that hired him
. they are also mercenaries that have tough
- looking haircuts
, talk with accents
,
and try tothe show how macho they are
. during their trip across the stormy sea
, their boat suffers an incident
and requires repairs
. spotting a cruise ship in the distance
, they make their way to the ocean liner
and devise a plan to raid the machine shop
, take the parts that they ened
,
and
then continue onthe their merry way
. little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster
.
yet
, they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades
and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds
. this is nothing more than a by
- the
- book action film
. their realization of tje situation that they
' re in doesn
' t happen untl they are in tyhe bowels of the boat
. those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed
. tghe corridors on the ship are narrow
, misty
,
and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare
- fests must have
.
yet
, dispite the predictable nature of this film
, there are some scary
" boo
" moments
.
but most ofthe it is just outright silly
.
and this film is unusually gory too
. monsters basically suck off the flesh
and spit out skeletal remains
. there isnt one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart
and reveals a victim that is still alive
. he screams horribly as the monster
' s digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away
. addtionally
, it borrows heavily from speed2
, alien
and a bunch of other recent films
. the mercenaries even run into a lone
, surviving passenger
( femke jannsen
) who looks amazingly like s
andra bullock
. to be honest
, when i left the theatre
, i just had to laugh at how witless the film was
. it
' s moronic fun at best
. so
, if you
' re hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness
,
then this might just hit the spot
.
