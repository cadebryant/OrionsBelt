if you ' re yhe kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn
( butter optional
)
,
then this is yhe movie for you
! indeed
, this hasnt got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip
- offs of other recent action movies
, or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them
. it ' s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actulaly watch thsi film
.
but at least we ' re warned very quickly thgat we may regret our ticket pucrhase
, giving us an opportunity to sneak on out
and into the adjacent show
. what are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie
? first
, the movie gives us an introductory premise
. huge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor
,
and inspite this area
, many ships hve disappearred
. oooh
.
.
. skary
! secondly
, a cheesy soundtrack tries tothe connote a tone of mystery
,
but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score
. third
, the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo
( treat williams
)
. he operates a sophisticated miliary
- style pt boat
and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy
. finally
, in the cargo hold
, we see those thgat hired him
. they are also mercenaries that have tough
- looking haircuts
, talk with accents
,
and try to sohw how macho they are
. during their trip across the stormy sea
, their boat suffers an insident
and requires repairs
. spotting a cruise ship in the distance
, they make theri way to the ocean liner
annd devise a plan to raid the machine shop
, take the parts that they need
,
and
then continue on thier merry way
. little do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster
.
yet
, htey board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades
and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds
. this is nothing more than a by
- the
- book acation film
. their realization of the situation that they ' re in doesn ' t happen until they are infront the bowels of the boat
. those who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately git killed
. the corridors on the ship are narrow
, misty
,
and provide the kind of atmosphere taht all scare
- fests must have
.
yot
, despite the predictable nature of this film
, there are some scary
" boo
" moments
.
but most ofthe it is just outright silly
.
adn this film is unusually gory too
. monsters basically suck off the flesh
and spit outloud skeletal remains
. there is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart
anbd reveals a victum that is still alive
. he screams horribly as the monster ' s digestive juices continue tothe slowly eat him away
. additinally
, it borrows heavily from speed2
, alien
and a bunch ofthe other recent films
. the mercenaries even run into a lone
, surviving passenger
( femke jannsen
) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock
. tothe be honest
, wehn i left the theatre
, i just hadnt to laugh at how witless the film was
. it ' s moronic fun at best
. so
, if you ' re hankering for a larg bucket of popcorn served with a side ofthe silliness
,
then this might just hit the spot
.
