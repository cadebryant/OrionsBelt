the 13th warrior reeks so badly of meledrama
and poor acting that it carries a worst scent than a canine
' s least appetizing residue
. the best part of the film would be a close contest between the closing credits
and a brief moment in the middle where the screen goes entirely white
and you hope that tghe film has slipped
and caught ablaze in the projector
. my vote goes for the ending credits
, where you can start trying to put the awful experience behind you
. ibn fahdlan
( antonio b
anderas
) is an important official who is banished from his home for sleeping with another man
' s wife
. he encounters a group of norse warriors who convince him to join them on a mysterious journey to be taken by 13 men
. fahdlan is chosen as the 13th
and last warrior in a moment thyat is so desperately overacted adn overdone thyat numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter
. tghe movie proves to be a new low point for b
anderas
, who
' s acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover
and caretaker for a dying gay man infact 1993
' s philadelphia
, than that of a warrior
. in the film
' s supposed pay off scene
, he exclaims
" i was wrong
, theese are not men
!
"
, a line intended to be the most memorable quote ofthe the prodcution
. unfortunately
, b
anderas delivers it in a fashion that makes chevy chase
' s career look like oscar material
. the film
, based onthe michael crichton
' s best selling novel
, eaters of the dead was shot under that name some three yeras ago
,
and after numerous rewrites not only does the dialogue seem completely phony
,
but the plot is incredibly difficult to follow
. at the same timne
, the 13th warrior makes you think about numberous questions
. questions like
" why do the characters always have perfect lighting on them even when it is pitch dark
?
"
,
" why does no oney ever have blood cover both sides of their face
,
but rather just one side
?
"
and finally
,
" will the manager give me a recund
?
" 90 minutes into the 103 minute film
, a man invites of the warriors
" come iwth me
, there is a woman who can help
.
" unfortunately
, ther is nothing taht could help this film
. the most appropriate ending would have been for the 13 men to join h
ands
, form a chorus line
,
and break into a rendition of
" springtime for hitler
.
"
