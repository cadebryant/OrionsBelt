a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature
, beams itself onto a russian csience vessel
. well
, this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent
and original movei
and simply becomes a predictable sci
- fi thriller
. anyhow
, this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel
then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the
? virus
' known as man
. the original crew of the russian vessel is all
but exterminated
,
and
then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship
and tries tothe salvage it
. no more needs to be said as to whta happens
and where the conflict lies
, the movie is tyhat predictable
. the story is full of very shallow cahracters that don
' t do much other than subsist
. teh captain of the tug
, played by donald sutherl
and
, makse irrational choice aftter irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he hasnt survived long enough to reach his age
( looks to be in his 60
' s
)
. to add to this we
' re shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields
,
and at others seems barely capible of basic tasks
. some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one tothe wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific
, in a typhoon no less
. none of the characters seem to work together at all
; htey are always bickering
and vying for some form of control
. this makes no sense what so ever
and only takes away from the stoyr
, a story that is full of holes
and is extremely predicatble
. all the flaws of the actual story are only helped allong by the special effects
. tjhe waves thyat are generated tothe be part of the typhoon mkae it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub annd someone is simply creating waves
. it looks genuinely fake
, granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be eazy by any strech ofthe the imagination
but having the storm approach in a stlye similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends uv looking corny
and amateurish
. also on the topic of flaws
, tje robotics that the adavanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly
, why
? if thsi life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics
, shoudln it nto be able to create them move faster
? regardless
, the special effects in this movie in many cases take away ffrom the film rether than add to it
. as to the actual casting for the movie
, finally there isnt nothing to complain about
. hte actors weere superb
,
but
then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would ahev had difficulty acting the roles
. having the cast that ws present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe
. watching these actors act this story outloud made it bearable
, if barely
. the one saving grace of this movie is tath it was highly action packed
and there always seemed to be something happening
. so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything gr
and
and are only going to kill some time
and watch a mediocre sci
- fi thriller
then you won
' t be too disappointed
. as the movie is
but the latest in a genre that wass originally created by aliens
, it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect
. this movie would be best left for video
and even
then you might be advised to simply wait for one ofthe the major networks to air it on tv
.
