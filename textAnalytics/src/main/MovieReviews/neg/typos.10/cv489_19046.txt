thte u
. s
. army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals wich stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done
. oney particular field manual is known as the fm 22
- 5
, which among other things
, covers the practice of saluting
. under the
" saluting
" section is a sub
- section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military owrk detail in the presence of a superior officer
. the salute is rendered by the highest
- ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail
,
and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail
. in any event
, the salute is rendered only by the man
( or woman
) in charge
, rather than by the whole group
. almost at the very beginning of the general
' s daughter
, we see a general
' s motorcade passing a work detail
. everyone salutes
. it looked impressive
,
but it just wasn
' t right
. that little bit showed me that someone either didn
' t do the appropriate research
, or made the onscious decision to go with style over substance for thte scene
. in fact
, this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture
, as it seems director simon west tryed so hard to craft a film whith atmosphere
and flash that he forgot a coherent story
and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie
. what results is a film thta looks good
,
but like thta one scene
, jsut isn
' t right
. the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example
. paul brenner
( john travolta
) is an agent for the army
' s criminal investigation division
, undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale
. prior to the transaction
, the buyer gets a whiff thgat brenner isn
' t the unscrupulous supply sergeant he
' s suppossed to be
,
and later taht night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat onthe which brenner is living
. so ensues a cat
and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene inspite raiders of the lost ark
( we
' ll just say that it involves propellers
)
. brenner
then receives new orders when the comm
anding general
' s daughter
, captain elisabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, is found naked
, bound
,
and dead on oney of the base
' s training ranges
. he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill
( madeleine stowe
) to uncover tyhe truth baout the peculiarly gruesome murder
. what i want to know is why the whole acation scene with the arms buyer was even necessary
. it gives no insight inot brenner
, other than hte fact that he
' s a little cocky
. does the arms subplot turn up later
? no
, so why add this extra running time tothe the film
? the answer
: it looked cool
. or how about the
" atmosphere
"
? the beginning of thge general
' s daughter presents us with imagery ofthe the deep south
- thick trees
, dirt roads
, sultry colors over water
- all backed up with bayouesque music
. nice immersion in the setting
,
but it soon doesn
' t matter
, for when the film
' s plot shifts over to the murder investigation
, so does the entire mood
. no attention is paid to the location of the story
,
and thte music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme
. doed the filmmakers strat out thinking they were making a different movei
? instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film
, we get tyhe distraction ofthe one of theme followed by another
, just because the director
thought he should show off soem of the countryside
. the above examples alsot serve to illustrate that inconsistancy is another problem with this movie
. as i
' ve laready mentioned
, an entire section of the film doesn
' t jibe with the rest
,
and the characterization only adds to the difficulty
. brenner
, who comes across as a man wih little respect for authority
, suddenly snaps tothe in the presence of general campbell
( james cromwell
) annd utters some ofthe the corniest
" yes
, sir
" s i
' ve ever heard
. he even delivers an emotion
- charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general
' s daughter
, even
though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previvous
. sunhill
, who intially comes across as a professional investigator
, utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information
,
and even revels in her ingenuity
. both characters are protagonists
,
but it
' s hard to get behind them whn their personalities are all over the place
,
and in some cases
, simply unappealing
. i could imagine thta during filming
, west would shoot a scene
,
then take the actors aside
and tell them
,
" let
' s do it again
,
but this time
, i wnat more
.
" i say this because
al
though travolta annd stowe are normally very good
, in this film they overact in most of thier scenes
. an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general
' s aide
, colonel fowler
. i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention
. a far cry from his days as linc in
" the mod squad
"
, i can
' t help
but think he wass acting from west
' s direction
. a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist
( john beasly
)
and a young female private
( ariyan a
. johnson
) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear
. the only two actors who seem to have escaped west
' s influence are james woods
, who provides a ogod peformance as colonel moore
, elisabeth
' s mentor at the psychological operations unit
,
and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police
. woods relishes the role of a man whose job is palying with people
' s minds
, anbd does so without ever taking it over tjhe top
. hutton just kind of hangs around
,
but at least he wasn
' t overacting
. i haven
' t read the nelson demille novel on which this movei was based
,
but i
' ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better infact book form
. the movie verzion has got cahracters which come
and go with little or nothing to do except fill up spoace
, or provide bits ofthe information which seem to neither mean anything infact terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once thge whole story is finished
. every tyme we
' re presented with some new aspect to the case
, west gives us moreso of that flash by playing it up like it
' s the most momentous discovery ever
,
but the information is not used by the investigators at all
. instead
, wehn conclusions are drawn
, they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts
,
but lucky guesses instade
. the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan
and sunhill
, letting them play a game of twenty questions iwth the suspects
,
then letting them guess who the killer was
. would
' ve been over in a half hour
. the film finishes with a sort of bookend
, featuring the same style
and southern scenery as the very beginning
. literally during the closing credits
, we get to see brennan get in his car
and drive off
,
then we get to see sunhill get in her car
and drive off
. they both seem kind of happy
. maybe they were driving away from simon west
.
