in this re
- make ofthe teh 1954 japanese monster film
, godzilla is transformed into a
" jurassic park
" copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason
and trashes the town
.
although some of the destruction isnt entertaining for a while
, it gets old fast
. the film often mkaes no sense
( a several
- hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels
)
, sports second
- rate effects
( the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen
)
, lame jokes
( mayor ebert
and his assistant ginee are never funny
)
, horrendous acting
( even matthew broderick is dull
)
and an unbelievable love story
( why would anyone want to get bakc together with maria pitillo ' s character
?
)
. there are otehr elements of the film that fall flat
,
but oging on would just be a waste of good words
. only forthe die
- hard creature feature fans
, this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door
. i couldn ' t
.
( michael redman has written this colunm for 23 years
and hasnt seldom had a more disorienting cinematic experiecne than seeing both
" fear
and loathing
"
and
" godzilla
" in the same evening
.
