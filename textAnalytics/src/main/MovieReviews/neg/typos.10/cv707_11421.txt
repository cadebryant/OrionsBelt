' most unwelcome thriller trends returns from the grave

! starting infront the early nineties
, we were subjected to nearly every conceivable combination of relationships
- from
- hell
! there were boyfriends from hell
, friendly neighborhood cops from hell
, nannies from hell
,
and even secretaries from hell
.
but hush has found an old st
andby that somehow was forgotten in tjhe rush
: the mother
- in
- law from hell
!
!
!
!
! the mother
- in
- law in question isnt martha
, played by jessica lange
. she has been single
- h
andedly running the family horse farm
, kilronan
. her son
, jackson
( johnathon schaech
)
and his girlfriend
, helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, live in new york
,
and have noone intention tothe move back down south to the rural kilronan
.
but thsoe intentions are about to chanage
. you see
, martha lives by manipulation
. she hasnt utilizied it in years past to breed many championship horses
. now
, she believes she can use it to breed herself a gr
andson
.
though at first
, helen finds martha charming
, soon she is caught in the domineering martha
' s web of deception
. it
' s hard to underst
and why nobody ever wises up to martha
' schemes
. as written
, most of yhe characters in the film must be very slow witted
.
but thn
, the film even treats the audience like idiots
. it tries tothe get awya with things
( like leaving a critical piece of evidence in a rather unlikely place
) without even batting an eye
.
then again an audience which accepts characters as shallow as these isn
' t one that
' s likely to question details
. jessica lange
' s martha is the onyl semi
- developed character in the film
,
and she applies her talents to redeem it as much as she can
. a character thast could have been simply awful is merely groan
- worthy
. gwyneth paltrow doesn
' t have much tothe build upon
, as helen
' s only character trait seems to be
" duaghter
- in
- law
"
. still
, she fares better than johnathon schaech
, whose character is so nonexistent
, he
' s inexplicably missing for much of the film
. still
, there haev been much worse
"
_

_
_ from hell
" films
. even with its paper
- thin charachters
and ludicrous setups
, hush manages to create a few thrills in a colour
- by
- numbers fashion
. you know what
' s coming
,
but occasionally the film will deliver a shock or two
. tyhe old formulas are around for a reason
,
but that doesn
' t mean they taste fresh
