an experience like baby geniuses can ahve certain effects on an average moviegoer
. you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage
, which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it
' s hollywood existence
. when i think of the screenwriters behind this film
, i picture a room full of monkeys
. the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves
. all of the monkeys combine their efforts
, hop in a cab
and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark
' s office
. the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up
and down on clark
' s desk hwile flailing his arms annd shrieking
. the director appears to be deep in
thought
, until he slams his fist down on the desktop
and exclaims
` i love it
!
!
!
' the writing behind this project is embarrassing
. for your amusement
, i will explain the plot
. dr
. kinder
( kathleen turner
)
and dr
. heep
( christopher lloyd
) are two of the cold
- hearted executives at the baby geniouses institute
, where peculiar studies are going on
. as the story goes
, there is an ancient myth explaning that babies
( ages 2
and under
) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences
. when they move past htis phase
, they become like any other drooling toddler
. kinder
and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies
, namely little sylvester
( sly for short
)
, who can break infront or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home onthe the mission
: impossible team
. there is so much crap drived from this premise
, dispite tje fact it
' s virtually identical to the plot in look who
' s talking
!
( a far superior film in any league
)
. you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene
. sylvester has broken out
and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect
and kung
- fu tactics
. question
: it
' s obvious the babies are super
- smart
,
but why are they able to fight like jackie chan
?
? thge adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers
. it
' s a shock wehn writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes
' familiar home alone formula
. i also found it disturbing that tghe babies infront this film have attitude
and endless 90
' s knowledge
, quoting numerous movies
and insulting their adult captors
. the effects in baby geniuses
( simmilar to the talking animals in babe
) are pathetic
, the editting is a disaster
,
and the jokes are never funny
. the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the rgument that the babies are
` cute
'
. i suppose they are
. i can admitt to smiling a few times becouse teh babies were cute
. other instances
,
though
, i was howling inspite laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script
. there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever
; their entire existence is based on punch lines
. peter macnicol
and kim cattrall
, as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester
' s twin
, are both miscast
.
then again
, i don
' t suppose any performer could h
andle thte uneven material without looking incredibly stupid
. meanwhile
, dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hitted infact the crotch with a monkey wrench
( hahaha
)
. i would avoid baby geniouses at all costs
. instead of watching this
, i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement
and going snorkeling
. or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark
- infested waters
. anything to avoid this painful movie
. the final line in the film
, spoken by the bratty sylvester
, is
` if they think i
' m doing the sequel for less than
$ 20 mill
, they
' re nuts
'
. sequel
? please have mercy
.
