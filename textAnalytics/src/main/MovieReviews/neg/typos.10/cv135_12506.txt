( dreamworks skg
) running time
: 2 hours starring robert duvall
, tea leoni
and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of tghe twpo astroid movies coming out this year
( the second is the macho armageddon
) is actually a dull affair
. elijah wood plays leo biederman
, who during astronomy class dicovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth
. tea leoni plays a
( rather crap
) news reporter
, jenny lerner
, who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded
and boring way
,
and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew
, spurgeon tanner
, who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth
. also featuring is morgan freeman as the president
,
and maximilian schell
and vanessa redgrave as jenny
' s father
and mother
. while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up
( as the trailers seem to promise
)
, teh film is atually more of a character study
, if a very poor one
. the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film
,
and not enough tiem to explore them all
. onyl the space crew are given any depth
, jenny lerner
, leo
and the president are suprizingly 2d
,
and we never get to know these characters
.
and because i couldn
' t care for them
, i didn
' t really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not
. the script by bruce joel rubin
and michael tolkin is horribly simple
,
and never really makse any interesting statememts
. mimi leder
, the former er director
and director ofthe the average the peacemaker
( 1996
)
, again directs in a ho
- hum style
,
and never raelly gets any emotion out of a scene
, which is a shame
. the cast are seemingly on autopilot
,
al
though tea leoni does gives a rather good performance
, even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good
. she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist
. robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role
, he just seems to be in thsi film for the money
. elijah wood
, noe of the best child actors working today
, is surprisingly average
,
al
thought his choice of roles lately haven
' t exactly been briliant
( i
. e
. flipper
, 1996
)
. his role is also vastly underwritten
. morgan freeman
, again
, isnt utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role
. like duvall
, he just seems to be in the film for the money
. the supporting cast are all o
. k
, none making much of an impression
. ok
, so deep impact may have messed up character wise
, bu surely the special effects are good
? well
, yes
and no
. altho the special effects should be impressive
, with a massive tidal wave destroying new york
, the special effects look like
, well
, special effects
. sadly
, the waves looks like it
' s been drawn on computer
,
and doesn
' t look too good at all
. surprizing raelly
, when the effects are done by industrial light
& magic
, who did the effects for thte lost world
and twister
. infront the end
, deep impact is a wasted opportunity
. what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both cahracters
and effects
. tje 2 hours the film had could have beeen utilizied to much greater effect
. once again
, dreamworks has churned out another average movei
. let
' s hope armageddon is a bit better
. overall rating
