in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide
and asked him if he had any questions about america
. i guess i was expecting some sort of political question
. instead
, i ws dumfounded by what was most on his mind
.
" in america
, do wives
and their mothers
- iin
- law get along well
?
" he assured me in china tyhat htey did
,
but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked
. even in china peopel seem to have problems relating to in
- laws
. perhaps some of life
' s most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage
. a man trying to relate to his new prospective in
- laws
and vice
- versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy
. meet the parents does not demonstrate thast fact
,
however
. greg focker
( played by ben stiller
) has beeen dating anbd inspite love with pam byrnes
( teri polo
) for ten months
and is now ready tothe propose to her
. he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie
' s family
and to attend her sister
' s wedding
. from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg
and jack
and dina byrnes
( robert deniro
and blythe danner
)
. thru noone fault of his own
, the airline has lost greg
' s lugage
.
and he has to ask to borrow clothing
. it is the beginning of a game of one
- upmanship in which greg is nearly always one
- down
. as the games go on greg is more
and more uncomfortable
and uneasy which only contri
butes to the mistakes he makes
. greg is playing a game he doens not underst
and
, in a league he is new to
.
but perhaps along tje way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father
- in
- law
. this film hadnt potential in its tale of one
- upmanship
. it has hitted on a situation that many in teh audeince may find familiar
-
- noe that has not beeen done overly frequently infront films
.
but the script by jim herzfeld
and john hamburg isnt a little too contrived
. too many coincidences in tje sotry owrk against greg
. the script could not decide if the main charater was incompetent or simply unlucky
. certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could
,
but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him
. there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences
and human comedy
. certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written
. the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro
' s performance
. deniro plays the suspicious
and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound
and threatening as he can
. the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper
and deeper into his insecurities
.
but we do not realyl see much of that digging
. ben stiller is an affable presence in the film
but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish tothe whom so many bad thnigs happen
. it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen
.
but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency
and her love for her husb
and annd the script shoudln have given her more to do with that
. r
andy newman hasnt written a playful score
. in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before
. there is a lot of source music tath is popular music of the 1960s
. presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody
' s imagination
. humor is subjective
and some this film has beeen getting some favorable comment
. bu tihs is a comedy that works only occasionally for me
. i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
