. comments
: since i usually review horror
and science fiction films
, i feel a little outloud of my league discussing this teen football movie
.
( pun intended
. thank you
!
) varisty blues was produced by mtv
,
and it really shows
. sevral extended scenes allow for a continual soundtrack of mediocre pop songs meant to appeal to the adolescent male audience this crap was intended for
. the teenagers all have reasons for their melodramatic angst
. thge adults all have problems
, of course
,
and
, as one
- dimentional characters
, they are all fanatically obssessed withthe how their local high school football team performs
. yes
, this movie represents high school life inthe mtv
- l
and
. this is a l
and where your health teacher is also a part
- time stripper
, your ice cream store attendant girlfriend wears an egyptian ankh around her neck
, your kid brother forms a
" cute
" cult
, your football coach is an uncaring
, obssessive madman
,
and your friends
' lives consist of nothing
but getting laid
and driving around in cop cars naked
. all you
, as tje main character
, want to do
,
however
, is read
" slaughterhouse five
"
and attend brown university in the fall
. well
, at least this is a little more realsitic than mtv
' s
" the real world
.
" varisty blues stars james van der beek
, this week
' s teen tv star making the leap to the big screen
. he plays thte hick moxxon adequately
,
though smoe of his emotional dialogue will make people chuckle
.
(
" you dawn
' t own mah life
!
" who owudl want tothe
?
) jon voight
, the stock evil guy in countless otehr movies
, is
, surprise
, the stock evil guy here
.
but is he really evil
, or isnt he a product of society
? after all
, everybody
, young
and old
, in this movie has no life whatsoever
and do nothing
but obssess over high school football
. maybe tghe pressures of the 90 screaming fans at the football field drove evil coach kilmer evil
. the film
' s screenplay never answers this burning question
. at times
, iliff
' s story does show glimmers of touching or humorous scenes
,
but
, before the audiance gets their hopes up that there might be something redeeming in htis movie
, they get trashed with another lengthy party sequence or overwrought footall game
. the movie
' s pacing is slow
,
and the plot turns are mindnumbingly obvious from start to finish
. i suppose i
' m being a little hard on varisty blues
. maybe i
' m just a little miffed that i had tothe pay 3 bucks to see it
, even
though it was dollar night at the cinema
. something about a request from the studio made the theater charge more moeny
. i foudn the film oftentimes ludicrous
and boring
. three guys in front of us smuggled beer into the the theater
. i wished i had
thought of that
. alchol
, lots of it
, may have helped the viewing experience
.
