to sum the entire film
" 54
" uv in one sentence
, it woudl be
: watch a vh1 documentery instead
.
" 54
"
, seems like someone broght william faulkner into 1978
, brought him into studio 54
, got him really drunk
, told him to write about it
,
and
then dumbed that down tothe be released tothe tje public
. a sloppy version of almost stream of conciousness spirals down into an oblivion of the illusion of sex
, drugs
,
anbd disco
. the narrator
, shane o ' shae
( ryan phillippe
)
, works as a grease monkey in new jersey who
, of course
, onthe a whim decides to go inot new york
and try to get into studio
" 54
"
. phillippe gives a passable performance which could have been made by any young
, attractive actor whith a six pack stomach
. he is let infront by steve rubbell
( mike myers
)
, tghe infamous co
- owner ofthe studio 54
, because he is attractive
. he eventually becomes a bus boy
and
then a bartender
.
.
. you expected more
, didn ' t you
. ther isn ' t
. the film builds up from nothing
and becomes nothing as it ' s climax
( isn ' t that an apt word for studio 54
) lands witht a thud
. the glitz of the club
and perpetually semi
- clothed patrons are used in an tothe attempt to show the it ' s glamour
. for much ofthe its target audience
, college age to early thirties
, it attempts to show celebrities mixing with
" normal people
.
" this even fails since the only two celebs truely introduced are andy warhol
and truman capote
. you can be sure that half of the audience hasn ' t heard of them
, another quarter only know their names
,
and the other quarter knew they were there already
. the humor
, if you can call it that
, is built on an eighty yera old woman getting high
adn 70s refrences like john travolta
and olivia newton john making us laugh at how stupid we were back
then the best performance iin the film is given by mike myers as the perpetually high
, sexually ambivlaent
, very new york steve rubell
. he seems to play rubell better than rubell would if he was still alive
. he looks like rubell
and soudns just like him while giving a subdued
, almost nostalgic peformance
, when needed
. it reminds you ofthe his saturday night live character linda richmond on
" coffee talk
" sans dress
and wig
. the supporting cast of salma hayek
, breckin meyer
,
and neve cambell are their only ther tothe give added subplots which are introduced
but lead absolutely nowhere
. the romance between phillippe
and cambell
, as a soap opera star
, is completely implausable
. the two share about half as much screen time as there are shots ofthe the eighty year old hooked on amphetimenes
. hayek ' s wanna
- be singer seems extremely forced
and her husband
, greg
( meyer
) stands in as shane o ' shae ' s surrogate best friend
. the subplots seemed forced
and seem like they have been added just to make sure the film was over an hour
and a half long
. overall
,
" 54
" tried to give a view of the brashness of the place where crack flowed like heroin which flowed like wine
. the film never leads to anything
, hasnt no obserable point
,
and covers up a lack of real plot with a veil ofthe beautiful people
. in truth
, that reminded me of the eighies
.
