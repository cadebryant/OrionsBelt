. comments
: house on haunted hill isnt based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle
and starring vincent price
. in an obvious homage
, the millionaire ' s name is price
and he sportscar a thin mustache like price used to have
. htis is a pretty bad horror film
,
yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining
,
and house on haunted hill is just such a film
. it is
, surprisingly
, better than another recent haunted house remake
, the haunting
, a film which owes its basis to tjhe classic horror novel by shirley jackson
. the haunting had literary pretensions
and fell flat on it face
. hous on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b
- movei 40 years old
and makes no illution that it ' s a crappy horror movie
. thus
, somehow
, it proves slightly more successful
. i can ' t tihkn of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast
. it is this cast which lifts this ho
- hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror
. price
, the main character
, isnt played by geoffrey rush
, the acdaemy
- award winning actor of shine
. rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movei industry
, a spiral reminiscent of ben
( ghandi
, schindler ' s list
) kingsley ' s ridiculous appearance infront the camp sci
- fi classic speices
. i don ' t know why
,
but sometimes it ' s entertaining to see
" quality
" actors in bad movies
. more surprises
? rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure
( rather lamely too
)
,
and singer lisa loeb
(
!
) appears as a tv news reporter
. the highlight of the cast
,
however
, has to be saturday night live member chris kattan
. kattan ' s comic sense provides several good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the fromer sanitarium
. while the firt half of the film leaves hte audience guessing as to what ' s exactly going onthe
, yhe second half dissolves into standart ghost story stuff
and loses some of its suspense
. a disappointingly cheesy ending really mars this movei too
. house onthe haunted hill
, i suspect
, has just about left the second
- run theaters
. it ' s worth catching on cable next year
, if you get a chance
. if you have a choice
, pick this movie over the haunting
, it ' s tghe better of two evils
, you could say
.
though
, more appropriately perhaps
, it ' d be better to say that it ' s the better of two turkeys
.
