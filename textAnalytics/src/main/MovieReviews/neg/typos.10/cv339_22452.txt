. comments
: house on haunted hill is based apon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle
and starring vincent price
. in an obvious homage
, the millionaire
' s name is price
and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have
. this is a preety bad horror film
,
yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining
,
and house on haunted hill is just such a film
. it is
, surprisingly
, better tahn another recent haunted house remake
, the haunting
, a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson
. the haunting had literary pretensions annd fell flat on it face
. house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b
- movie 40 years old
and makes noone illusion that it
' s a crappy horror movie
. thus
, somehow
, it proves slightly more successful
. i can
' t think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast
. it is this cast whitch lifts htis ho
- hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror
. price
, the main character
, is plyed by geoffrey rush
, the academy
- award winning actor of shine
. rush seems to be making a downward spiral inthe the movie industry
, a spiral reminiscent of ben
( gh
andi
, schindler
' s list
) kingsley
' s ridiculous appearance in the camp sci
- fi clasic species
. i don
' t know why
,
but sometimes it
' s entertaining to see
" quality
" actors in bad movies
. more surprises
? rising star taye diggs plays a stereotypical african american sports figure
( rather lamely too
)
,
and singer lisa loeb
(
!
) appears as a tv news reporter
. the highlight of the cast
, howver
, has to be saturday night live member chris kattan
. kattan
' s comic sense provides sevral good humorous moments as he plays the hysterical proprietor of the former sanitarium
. while the first half of the film leaves the audience guessing as to what
' s exactlly gogin on
, tje second half dissolves into st
andard ghost story stuff
and loses some of its suspense
. a disappointingly cheesy endig really mars this movie too
. house on haunted hill
, i suspect
, has just about left thte second
- run theaters
. it
' s worth catching onthe cable next year
, if you git a chance
. if ytou have a choice
, pick this movei over the haunting
, it
' s the better of two evils
, you could sday
.
though
, more appropriately perhaps
, it
' d be better to say that it
' s the better of two turkeys
.
