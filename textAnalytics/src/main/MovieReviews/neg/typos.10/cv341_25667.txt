you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing
.
.
.
and it ' s not a comedy
!
and what a strange career path for director chuck russell
. he starts his career off with a decent take on teh
" nightmare on elm street
" series with his debut as director on installment number three
. he follows that up with the blob the very next yearm
,
but waits another six yeras to do his next piece
, a little film called the mask starring jim carrey
,
and
then oen more star vehicle in eraser two years affter that
. so
thn he thought
,
" let me wait another five years
, get a weak script jammed with cliches
and hope that jimmy smits
and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes
"
?
!
? strange dude
and one crappy flick
. plot
: a six
- year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god
. a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side
, while the girl ' s aunt wants to
.
.
. well
, save her from thsoe damn devil worshippers
! enter one occult expert agent
, plenty of bobo cops
and lots of nuns praying
,
and you ' ve jsut about got the gist of things here
. critique
: with plot holes the size of my ass
, this movie barely squeezes any sence out of its clich
?
- ridden plot
, with wasted talent
, cheezy effects
, bad dialogue
and unintentional laughs to boot
. what ' s ogod about this movie
? well
, rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children ' s shelter
/ satanist supreme
, with seriously wicked eyes
and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around
. the little girl is alsot preety good
but unfortunately her character doesn ' t really do all that much
.
and believe it or not
, i was actually enjoying some of the film ' s first half hour
, which starts off with some promise
,
but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our prtoagonist
, basinger
, just drown the film ' s entire basis of believability
. fo some reason
, it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted
,
and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes
.
.
. is a dumb one
! add that to the entire police force of incompetents
, save for jimmy smits
( whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move
? at least change the clothes
, jimmy
!
)
, zero scares
, zero thrills
and even less actual drama
,
and you ' ve got yourself a pretty bad movie
.
anbd why would respected actors like christina ricci
and ian holm tkae bited parts in htis movie
? did they owe the director a favor or something
? together
, they bearly have five minutes of screen time
,
but i suppose that ricci ' s hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn
- dogs
. the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending
, which features police officers coming up with the briliant diea of
" sneaking up
" on a man ' s house
, who they know to be guilty of a crime
! uuuhmm
.
.
. how ' s about knocking on the door
and arresting his sorry ass
, officers
?
! anyway
, i don ' t usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews
but the stupidity of some of theese characters is just too difficult to decribe without validating it with solid idiotic proof
(
and there was plenty to go around
)
.
and did basinger lose some of her acting
" talent
" durig her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win
? difficult tothe sday if it was her lines that were really bad
, or if she just delivered them poorly
. either way
, little originality
, very obvious computer effects
, little thrills
, little drama
and very little entertainment value
, certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film
.
but if you really don ' t mind a rehashed gobbledygook of varous satanic
and
" kid
"
- based thrillers
,
and enjoy watching films that don ' t bring anything new to the table
.
.
. well
, drink some beers
, smoke some beans
annd rent this video
, because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year
