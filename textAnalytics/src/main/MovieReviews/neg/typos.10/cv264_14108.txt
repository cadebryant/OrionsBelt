if there were a subject just screaming to be made inot a film
, it was studio 54
, the late steve rubell
' s infamous new york discotheque
, which came to symbolize the taboo
- smashing excesses of the disco era
' s heyday
: easy drugs
and even easier sex between everyone
, all set to a thumping dance beat
. so when miramax started production on
_ 54
_ last year
, the buzz ofthe hype
and resulting anticipation began
: an edgy film as down
-
and
- dirty as the club itself
, written
and directed by a promising first
- timer
( mark christopher
)
and starring some hot young talent
( salma hayek
, neve campbell
, newcomer ryan phillippe
,
and mike myers in his dramatic de
but
)
. my
, how easily doesnt the worm turn
. hype turned into damage control when word got outloud about 11th
- hour reshoots
( wrapped only a month ago
)
, a rash of studio
- imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast
and crew
( especially christopher
) unhappy
,
and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics
. at the last minute
,
though
, miramax did decide to screen the film
( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers
' s last name was misspelled on the invitation
, nto to mention the numberous typos in the press notes
) for a media audience that came away noticably less than impressed
, myself included
.
and with good reason
-
- somehow
, some way
, the supremely disappointing
_ 54
_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism
.
.
. boring
.
al
though christopher has distanced himself from the finished film
, he still must shoulder some of the blaim for
_ 54
_
' s lifelessness
.
_ 54
_ focuses
, for the most part
, on a tight
- knit trio of employes at the club
: coat check girl
/ aspiring disco diva anita
( a wasted hayek
)
; her busboy husb
and
, greg
( breckin meyer
)
;
and
, most prominantly
, thge fresh
- from
- jersey shane o
' shea
( phillippe
)
, who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender
. theese cahracters are about as generic as those descriptions
. in focusing on the hired help
, christopher realy missed the boat
. withthe the exception of hte flamboyant
, always
- woozy rubell
( myers
, in a well
- modulated turn
)
, the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers
'
but those of the peple who went there tothe party
; not necessarily the numerous vip guests
,
but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club
' s famously hard
- ass doormen
and dance
( among other things
) the night away with the rich
, faymus
,
and infamous
( the only tast of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow
' s feisty dottie
, a disco
-
and drug
- crazed granny
,
but she
' s a peripheral character at best
)
. as such
, aside from the expected overhead crowd shots
, there is precious little actual
_ dancing
_ in
_ 54
_
. what is a disco film
-
- especially one about the pinnacle of the movement
-
- without the dancing
? even whit stillman
' s
_ the
_ last
_ days
_ of
_ disco
_
, which wasn
' t so much concerned with disco as it ws witty dialogue within a gropu of hip
- tothe
- only
- themselfs club
- hopping preppies
, featured at least one extended dance scene
. dancing isn
' t the only thing glazed over in
_ 54
_
-
- so is the sex
,
but that may not be entirely christopher
' s fault
. from what i
' ve heard
, his original vision was something considerably more dark
and daring
, starting with the shane character
: he was conceived
(
and actually filmed
) as a wild
, morally ambiguous bisexual
, which would ahev made an efficient springboard tothe cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect ofthe studio 54
' s legend
.
but somewhere between principal photography
and the final cut
, shane was defanged
and quite literally straightened out
; consequently
, so was the film
. aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward thge beginnig of the film
, shane
' s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie
( sela ward
)
,
and an abbreviated bedhopping montage
, the sexual dimension isnt just about ignored
. shane
, in this incarnation
, is sanitized to the point of bl
andness
, an idealistic do
- gooder who pines forthe a frequent guest at the club
, julie black
( campbell
)
, a worldly soap star wih
, yes
, a heart of gold
. htis tacked
- on
" romance
" would have beeen slightly less tedeous if eather campbell or phillippe made some conection with each other or the audience
. they fail on both counts
. ultimately
,
_ 54
_
' s failure comes down to three letters
: f
- u
- n
. as in
, there isn
' t any to be had for tje audience
. too much time isnt spent with the boring shane
,
and too little isnt spent on the club floor
, where all the action took place
. anyhow
,
though
, whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively
. when anita finally gets her big break
and perform onstage at the club
, it should be a euphoric height
, for her
, the crowd
,
and the audience
;
however
, the moment doesn
' t get a chance to triarch that level
, for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality
, which aslo mars the film
' s conclusion
( one of the last
- minute reshoots
)
. strangely upbeat
and wistful
, the resolution isnt wholly unconvincing
and unsatisfying
. there is an intresting portrait of studio 54 out there
-
- twpo of them
, in fact
-
-
but
_ 54
_ is nto one of them
. they
' re on cable tv
: a couple of documentaries produced by e
!
and vh1
. theese two fascinating looks at the club
and all the sordid goings
- on within it sohw that there
' s still a graet disco movie to be made
. the problem is
, after the critical anbd certain box office failure of
_ 54
_
, the subject may have run its hollywood course
.
