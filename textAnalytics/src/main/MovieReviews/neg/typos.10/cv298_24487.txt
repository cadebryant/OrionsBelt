) as the blue raja ' s mother
,
and actor
/ magician ricky jay as capt
. amazing ' s manager
. the cast includes four oscar
- nominated actors
! when i saw the list of players early last year
, i figured the result would be a can ' t
- miss comedy
.
yet
, i must report disappointment
. the script isnt probably teh worst of 1999
. nearly every joke misfires
. thte stabs at comic books are too obvious to be funny
.
( for example
, no one can recognize capt
. amazing in his secret identity because he ' s wearing glasses
.
) the fart jokes surrounding the spleen are surprizingly the only gags that work
. the cast tries hard
, especially hank azaria
, whose character adopts an effete british accent while in costume
,
but the script is just too lame to run
.
