for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo
( the killer
, hard boiled
, face off
) appears to have made an exciting
, elegant
, charming spy thriller
, kind of a post millennim james bond adventure with a strapping american
( read
: unsophisticated
) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them
. sadly
, as teh picture progresses
, the final product begins tothe bear a closer resemblance tothe a souped up
, two
- hour long episode of magyuver
.
and not a particularly good one at that
. waht went wrong
? mi2 begins flashily enough
, that initial flash leading us to believe that it
' ll soon give way to something of a plot
,
but it only gives way to more flash
,
then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing
and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of toom cruise
' s firing gun just so they can die really cool
. early on
, during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt
( tom cruise
)
and nyah nordoff
- hall
( th
andie newton
)
, woo works some of his trademark magic
. in one hypnotic
,
though completely inexplicable sequence
, the director slows the action down to a languid semi
- stall as cruise
and his stunning opponent stare into one
and other
' s eyes with come hither sexuality
?
?
? just as their respective cars smash
and spin in accordance
, coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff
. prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain
, sans scaffolding
,
then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another
. why
? i haven
' t the foggiest
. i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply
. with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine
, the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects
and story for more gravity defying effects
. it
' s possible that these
" spies
" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains
and crashing into each other as means to get off
,
though of course this is never explored
. the scenes i
' ve described are realy only included to titillate
, not to give any insight into character
. god forbid
. woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic
,
but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial
- liek visuals
. still in terms of crackerjack eye c
andy
, the opening has much to cherish
. cruise adn newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices
( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is
)
. between hte frantic dancing
, woo trains his camera on cruise
and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact
. the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way
,
yet it has style
and something of soul
,
and woo casts a bit ofthe a spel onthe us
. sure it
' s all smoke
and mirrors
,
but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind tihs particular product
. th
andie
and cruise later meet inspite a bathtub in a scene thgat
' s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez
\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sighth
. they flirt
and exchange obvious double entendres
. newton bats her eyes flirtatiously
. cruise grins a little too slyly
. the cruise character
, ethan hunt
, has been drastically altered since the first film
. here cruise plays him more as a hip
, sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1
. he
' s cool
and dashing
, which is precisly the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut
( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film
)
,
and blustered his way through magnolia
( quite possibly the most overrated performance of tjhe 90
' s
)
. sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise
' s initial
" i
' m the man
!
" charm
and more slo
- mo close
- ups of his preening mug
. mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious thrid act
, which is essentially oen hour long acation sequence that just won
' t stop
. the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle
( the first gun fight infront the film
)
, which really should be unheard of in a john woo film
,
but alas this particular battle could
' ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi
( ofthe course excepting the
" symbolic
" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture
)
. we
' ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun infront each h
and
. it isn
' t done any differently here
. the action is pure hard target
\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it
but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind
. he
' s kool for sure
but he
' s made to be as empty as the movie
. the actor isn
' t utilisied so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks
; he smiles narcissistically into yhe camera at literally any moment
, be it during a gunfight
, before one or after one
. when he
' s not beaming awya
, he
' s staring inot the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell
,
but woo
' s editing seriously undermines the effort
. he fetishizes cruise
' s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof
. i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask
and reveal that he
' s really austin powers
. in a classic woo action moment
, ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame liek a pin
- up boy angel of death
. the gunfight turns into a daring excape which turns into a reckless mission which turns inot a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like soem kind of massmedia suicide ritual
( noe dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise
, basically inviting our h
andsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does
)
. the lead bad guy
( played by the appropriately british dougray scott
)
and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game ofthe chicken
?
?
? on motorcycles
.
though instead of jumping off tothe the side at the last moment
, the twpo grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug
, only tothe fly about a hundred feet
( still inwhich bear hug position
)
, l
and on a beach below
and begin a mano
- e
- mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a
" so you
thought i was dead
.
.
.
"
. nto to worry
, cruise takes care of yhe problem wihtout even breaking a sweat
. what a hero
! you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2
' s plot
. my reasoning isnt simple
: i
' m not sure of any good it owudl do
. the film itself has absolutely no concern with story
, onyl with hurtling forth to the next
" special
" effect
. i wasn
' t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video
. nobody will go to this for the plot
,
and if they dont they
' ll surely regret it
. as summer movies evolve
( or devolve
) character
and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing
. in mi
, the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma
' s
( that film
' s director
) stylistic flourishes
, while in mi2 hte plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo
' s non
- stop masturbatory p
andemonium
. it
' s irrelevant in every sence
, as is character
. all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke
and mirrors
.
