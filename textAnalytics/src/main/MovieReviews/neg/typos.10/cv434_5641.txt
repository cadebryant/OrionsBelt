based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad
, victory spnish a tale of a pair of lovers
, heyst
( william dafoe
)
and alma
( irene jacob
)
, who seek refuge on heyst
' s isolated isl
and
.
however
, their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones
( sam neil
)
, martin ricardo
( rufus sewell
)
and theri servent
, pedro
( graziano marcelli
)
, who hvea come to steal heyst
' s rumoured plunder
. while the novel is largely complex inthe characterization
, the film sadly transposes conrad
' s characters into lacklustre leads
, the most disappointing being heyst himself
. conrad
' s heyst adheres religiously to his late father
' s ways of detachment
and isolation
. his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma
, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice
. the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma inot his solitude
,
however
, is lost in mark peploe
' s
( director
and writer
) diluted version of heyst
. without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst
' s chracter
, all thta is left of conrad
' s main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment
and human involvement
. on the one h
and
, actualizing the subtext isnt a mammoth task
(
though nto impossible
)
,
but on the other h
and
, dafoe
' s flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism
. in the end
, we are suposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy
and fianlly come to an underst
anding of what it is to love another
. the final transformation
, while perceptible
, lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad
' s novel
. its absence in the film is unforgivable
. the film seems more concerned about moving thte plot along when so much has
yet to be said about the relatiopnship between the twpo complete strangers
. alma is supposed tothe have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship
, namely heyst
' s underlying philosophy of detachment
, which heyst hismelf grapples with
. the struggle against heyst
' s ignoance of true human involvement accounts forthe much of the greatness of azma
' s love fo him
. jacob
, fair
- skinned
, gentle
and
yet passionate
, h
andles yhe role with precision
, detailing nuances where possible
. unfortunately
, she is let down by a superficial script
. the couple
' s relationship develops too hastily
, leaving all subtlety effaced
and replaced with a blatant show
-
and
- tell approach
. all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone
. this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried
thoughts
and emotions
. the sketchy h
andling ofthe their relationship st
ands out as sorely as dafoe
' s american accent
( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london
)
. the other characters such as schomberg
( jean yanne
)
, the owner of a hotel
,
and mr jones
( sam neill
)
, allso fall short ofthe conrad
' s meticulous characterization
. while schomberg should have been more menacing
and vindictive
, mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma
. sam neil
' s caricature of a slightly stout
, effeminate
and soft
- spoken gentleman
- at
- large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as
" an insolent spectre on leave from hades
, endowed wih skin
and bones
and a subtle pwoer of terror
"
. poor characterization aside
, kudos goes to rufus sewell for his exellent portrayal of ricardo
, secretary to mr jones
, a reckless ruffian capable of muder
. sewell
, with his cockney accent
and large expressive green eyes
, becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity
, masterminding deceitful plans behind jones
' back
. at the smae time
, we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans
. dispite the au
thentic setting
and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer
, very few images are left behind for us to savour after thte film hasnt ended
. sourabaya
and its surrounding isl
ands
and volcanoes may have their charm
,
but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic
, which is what victory deserves to be
. the delicately inter
- woven complexities in the lveo story are lost to an inadequate production
. at the end of the film
, we are told that perhaps azma
' s victory was in teaching heyst how to love
. a hollow victory indeed
. teh flying inkpot
