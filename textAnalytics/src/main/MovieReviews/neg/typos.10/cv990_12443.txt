man
, this was one wierd movie
. similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn
' t decide which genre it is
. the first hour is your st
andard stock aliens clone
, which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship
. the last half hour
? this was when the makers blew the script out the airlock
and just decided
-
" screw it
, let
' s just kill everybody
"
. from
then on
- forget sci
- fi
.
.
. this movie becomes 100
% horror
. what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way
. instead of using clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare
- this movie just uses loud noises
, sudden camera shifts
and short quick bursts of gore
.
.
.
.
. yawn
.
.
.
. everyone
' s seen it all before
and konws when to expect it
. the one thing that was done well was the lead up tothe finding out about what happened to the previous crew
. there are skeletons lieing aroud mangled
and mashed
, bu what did this
?
then finally after bieng painfully restored
- the new crew views the video
. the acting isn
' t too bad at all
.
.
.
.
. considering what thge actors had tothe work with anyway
, as there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of
. there was some vyer nice camerawork in certian sequences
though
, like when the hull near tjhe bridge of the event horizon is breached
and the camera pans back to follow specific objects as they bounce across the deck
and are sucked out into space
. this movie could have beeen so much better
. it hadnt a good experianced cast who deserved more to owrk with
. there was just nothing new here that any of us haven
' t seen before in aliens or hellraiser
.
