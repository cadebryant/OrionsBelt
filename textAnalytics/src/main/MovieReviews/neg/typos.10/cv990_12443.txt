man
, this was one wierd movie
. similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn ' t decide which genre it is
. the first hour is your standart stock aliens clone
, which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship
. the last half hour
? this wass when the makers blew the script out the airlock
and just decided
-
" screw it
, let ' s just kill everybody
"
. ffrom
then on
- forget sci
- fi
.
.
. this movie becomes 100
% horror
. what really dissappointed me about this movie was that it tried to scare you in entirely teh wrong way
. instead of useing clever tricks or trying to build up to a scare
- this movie just uses loud noises
, sudden camera shifts
and short quick bursts of gore
.
.
.
.
. yawn
.
.
.
. everyone ' s seen it all before
and knows when to expect it
. the one thing that was done well ws the lead up to finding out about what happenned to the previous crew
. there are skeletons lying around mangled
and mashed
,
but what did this
?
then finally after being painfully restored
- tghe new crew views the video
. tghe acting isn ' t too bad at all
.
.
.
.
. considering what the actors had to work with anyway
, as there is no complex or intresting dialogue to speak of
. there was some very nice camerawork in certain sequences
though
, like whn the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached
and the camera pans back to follow specif objects as they bounce across the deck
and are sucked out into spoace
. this movie coudl have been so much better
. it had a ogod experienced cast who deserved more to work with
. there was just nothing new here that any ofthe us haven ' t seen before in aliens or hellraiser
.
