in 1990
, the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above
- the
- title stars
, patrick swayze
, demi moore
,
and whoopi goldberg
. eight years later
, moore
and goldberg
' s careers aren
' t exactly thriving
,
but they have had their share of screen successes since
; the same can
' t be said of swayze
, who has just added yot another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog
. forget the mortal kombat movies
-
- tihs trucksploitation flick isnt the closest the movies has come tothe video ganes
. good truck driver jack crews
( swayze
) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey
. along the way
, jack annd his crew ofthe three run into a number of obstancles
-
- such as a highway weigh station
, evil truckers
, anbd deadly uzi
- firing motorcyclists
. every so oftenly
, like at the end ofthe a video game
" level
" or
" stage
,
" the main baddie pops up
: red
( meat loaf
, fresh from the triumph of spice world
)
, who wants to steal the cache of guns
. just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track ofthe who
' s driving what
, all ofthe red
' s vehicles
, be it a pickup or a big rig
, are painted
-
- you guessed it
-
- red
. i could go inot more of the plot specifics
( such as jack
' s dream of having a nice home with his family
, the past trauma that sent him to prison
and cost him his trucking license
, the fbi
/ atf crew tracking the cargo
)
, bu they are of little importance
. all that matters to director kevin hooks
and writers william mickelberry
and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive fomr point a tothe point b
.
but tehy fail at even thsi modest goal
, for none of yhe highway chaos
, as credibly staged as it is
, is terribly interesting
, let alone exciting
. once you
' ve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time
, you
' ve seen it every time
. as dreary as black dog isnt as an entertainment
, the saddest part about the film has nothing tothe do with wqat shows up onscreen
; it
' s that swayze has to reduce himself to such work
. while far from the best of actors
, he is certainly nto horrable
, anbd he is a charismatic presense
. i don
' t know if it
' s his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog
. regardless
, if he continues on this career tarck
, could a tv series be far behind
?
