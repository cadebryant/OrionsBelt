a big house
. a big director
, jan de bont of speed adn twister fame
. a big star
, catherine zeta
- jones
, hot of the heels of entrapment
( 6
. 5
/ 10
)
and zorro
. a big remake of the haunting
.
and big special effects
. so what do they all amount tothe
? unfortunately forthe us
, a big bore
! plot
: a hotshot doctor brings three insomniacs to an old
, spooky mension for controlled testing
. unbeknownst to the patients
, tje good doctor is ctually conducting his pwn cover project that has to do with the psychology of fear
. critique
: tihs movie just didn
' t scare me oney bit
. sure
, it creeped
and spooked me out a little here
and there
,
but onthe tje whole
, it took waaaaay too long to get going
, provided very little meat in the plot
, went way past its own bedtime
,
and basically relied on grunts
, the muttering ofthe children
' s voices
and over
- the
- top special effects
, to scare us
. well
, this film didn
' t dont much for me
.
and they might as well have called it the
" haunting ofthe lily taylor
"
, since she
' s basically thte only charater who had any real depth
, background or reason to be in the house in the first place
. don
' t get me wrong
, catherine zeta was sweet window dressing
( despite my continued perception of her faint mustache
- see entrapment
)
,
and owen wilson was good as the st
andard
" comic relief
"
,
but come on people
, if you
' re going to have us sit through two hours in a theather with these folks
, how
' bout giving them a little more than one
- liners as dimension
. neeson was also wasted as the smart
, british guy
. it
' s all too sad
, cause certainly the
" idea
" seemed like a good one
( see the shineing
( 9
/ 10
) for a close to perfect example of a creepy gone awry
)
,
but tghe story ws thin
, the conclusion was laughable
( be gone
.
.
. poof
!
)
and the speshal effects
? well
, they sure were nice to look at
,
but not for a moment did one of them scare
, or even for a split
- second
, have me believe that they were anything more than hollywood special gadgetry
. see it for zeta
- jones
, or if you like special effects
and scary movies that take forever to get going
,
and provide very little payback
, otherwise skip it anbd check outloud hte original or the ultimate movei about spooky homes from the netherworld
, the shining
