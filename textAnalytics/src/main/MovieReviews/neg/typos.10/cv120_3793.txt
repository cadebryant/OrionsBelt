starting with the little mermaid
and most recently the lion king
, the walt disney company once again proved that they could not onyl consistently make modern day animated classics
,
but were particularly in touch whith what hte general viewing public
-
- particularly kids
-
- wanted to see
. therfore
, it
' s with some suprize that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas
. despite some inovation
and risk taking
, the stoyr is surprisingly straightforward
and dramatized in broad strokes
, as are its characters
. a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the
" savages
" that live there
. the natives look upon the english with just as much fear
and distrust
. onyl the love between the beautifuly structured pocahontas
and the dashing captian john smith can prevent a terrible clash
. the ending
, as it turns out
, is not entirely a happy one
and is noe of the film
' s finer moments
. the characters are mixtures ofthe stereotypes
and lack any real depth
. governor ratcliffe
, for instance
, is a snobbish
, single
- minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses
. captain john smith is a blond hunk who
, while
" slightly
" misguided
, isnt good at heart
. pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who isnt practically being forced to marry a man who everyone
but her likes
and finds the man of her dreams jstu in time
. she even comes complete with insignificant best friend
. again
, against tradition
, talking animals aren
' t utilizied
,
but a lusty
, wizened
, talking tree is
. this is an odd compromise
,
but it
' s one of the few elements tyhat really work
. the animals are a delight
,
and wqat brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor
and fun to a rather bl
and presentation
. maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes
. tjhe talking tree
, who seems to hve a thing for john smith
, is the only other character that can hold our interst
and is perhaps the best developed of yhe bunch
. the music
, a welcome delight in the later disney films
, is mostly a let down here
, with the exception of teh catchy
and motivational
,
" colors of the wind
.
" mel gibson
, as the voice of john smith
, has a solid singing voice
and should have beeen used more
. the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs
; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character
. i was rather bored through whta turned out to be a shorter than expected running tiem
. even the children in tghe audience seemed restless
. hwile there
' s no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want
-
- or disney wants them to
-
- most i believe will be disappointed
. perhaps the biggest problem is that disney hasnt strayed from their familiar fable
and fairy tale themes to history
. it
' s all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie
' s entertainment value
,
but doing so to historical facts doesn
' t work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer
' s minds
and plot holes that are never filled
. even the artwork
, another disney strong point
, varies greatly in quality
, making any story problems even more obvious
. as mentioned above
, htere were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film
. for instance
, if john smith was truly such a world traveler
and had so much experience with
" savages
,
" why did he so quickly change his previous
" kill as many indians as i can
" attitude
. if he was such a nice guy affter all
, he should hvae changed his ways long before this
. or how about pocahontas
' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly beeen the first time she had seen white men
? i can underst
and making the native americans speak english for the benifit of the audience
,
but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot
; history ws modified in teh film anyway
. as it is
, i wonder if it doesn
' t give kids the wrong impression
. in short
, the film is too simplistic for adults
and contains too much romance
and not enough action or humor for the younger set
. while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with smoe of their firmest traditions
, they end up failing onthe too many levels
.
