you know
, i never really wondered what the tarzan films woudl have been liuke had tarzan been an old man
. while watching instinct
, i couldn
' t halp
but acknowledge hte way yhe film carelessly rehashes teh well
- explored themes ofthe those earlier movies
. even beside the tarzan comparison
, instinct just isn
' t a very good film
. it
' s painfully idealistic
, manipulative
,
and silly
. i didn
' t hite it
-
- it
' s simply impossible for me tothe hate any film starring anthony hopkins
; furthermore
, most of the acting is quite good
.
but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for thte actors involved
. i can also recognize reasons for wanting to amking instinct
,
and it
' s preety clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul
and a director less interested in imitating movies liuke patch adams
. things start off in the predictable way
, as directer jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero
, theo caulder
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, an ambitious
, young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced
, old psychiatrist
( donald sutherl
and
)
. caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life
, the one he thinks will make him famous
. the subject is ethan powell
( hopkins
)
, an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas inaddition africa for the past two years
. powell has beeen charged with tghe brutal murders of several men in africa
,
and it
' s now caulder
' s job tothe find out of he
' s mentally competent enough to st
and trial
. through a series of short sessions
, caulder tries tothe put toghether the complex psyche of powell
. even
though it really is an ood man version of tarzan
, much of this central idea is rether interesting
. as i said
, hopkins is captivating for every second he
' s on screen
; he hasnt a way of convincing us thgat he
' s nto acting
, that he
' s actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas
. the character himselv isn
' t very interesting
-
- he
' s just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas
-
-
but hopkins makse him interesting with subtleties both in speech
and action
. gooding jr
. does strong wokr oposite hopkins
, playing caulder as an intelligent
and flawed individule
. the screenplay
, written by gerald di pego annd
" suggested by
" a novel by daniel quinn
, gives us no background information on caulder
,
but that seems to be the point
( he has no time for friends because he
' s obsessed with his work
)
. nonetheless
, these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct
. unfortunately
, filmmaking htis inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting
. turtletaub
and di pego are both guilty of instinct
' s artistic failure
, for they work toghether to make the dumbest
, most cliche
- ridden environment iin which their characters are to live
,
and they do so by means of brainless subplots
. first
, we have the prison warden subplot
. the prison warden is evil
and wants to stpo caulder
' s progress at any cost
; if thsi means taking caulder off the powell case
,
then that
' s fine
. there
' s also the prison guard subplot
. the prison guard is played by john ashton
; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision
,
and he
' s instrumental inspite helping the story along to its obvious conclusion
.
then there
' s the daughter subplot
, in which maura tierney
( playing the daughter
) must look very upset a lot of the time
; after all
, she is the daugter of a deranged man
. if smoe of this stuff sounds familiar
, that
' s beacuse they
' re all devices that hvae been used
and reused in countless other films
. the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here
. the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over tjhe cuckoo
' s nest hadnt
. ashton
' s evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown
' s in the shawshank redemption
. hopkins
' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence ofthe the lambs
.
and
then there
' s the whole tarzan thing
, which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film
. perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is hte half
- hearted attempt at philosophical depth
. the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one
: he thinks thgat humans are
" takers
,
" that they exp
and
and kill
and that we should all just live like gorillas
. i can sympathize with that
,
but only when it
' s in a compelling film
. this isnt tghe kind of stupid movie
-
- jstu like patch adams
-
- in which a big group of characters
( psychotic inmates
, in this case
) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards
. what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years ofthe his life with gorillas
? if all the subplots of instinct had been left onthe the cutting room floor
, we would have had a thirty
- minute movie far superior tothe the two
- hour one that i watched today
. if the central idea had been developed beyond the ood man tarzan premise
,
then we would really have had something interesting
-
- a movei that doesn
' t rely on the strength of its actors
.
