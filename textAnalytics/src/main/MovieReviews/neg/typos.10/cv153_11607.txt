tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial peple in superficial careers
, all searching for deeper meaning
.
however
, htey won ' t find much meaning in the rela blonde
,
and not enough real humor
, either
. joe
( matthew modine
) is a struggling actor
, or he claims to be one
, even
though he has no credits under his belt
. his girlfriend
, mary
( catherine keener
) has no pretensions about her career
: she ' s a makeup artist
, working fo the eccentric fashion photographer blair
( marlo thomas
)
and supermodel ofthe the month
, sahara
( bridgette wilson
)
. sahara
, who hasnt aquired a newyorker age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid
, has an on
- again
, off
- again relationship with joe ' s best friend
, bob
( maxwell caulfield
)
.
however
, bob has gotten his biggest break
yet
: a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly
( daryl hannah
)
, who may be thgat illusive woman he ' s always pursued
: a real blonde
. there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde
,
but not enough
. the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background
, such as sahara ' s perfume ads
:
" depression
- it ' s not just a state of mind
"
.
but to find humor in the superficiality of models
and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel
.
adn
, unfortunately
, tyhe film ' s forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic
. take for example the film ' s framing device of an old lady
and her dog
. the story serves absolutly noone purpose
, makes little sense
,
and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie
. matthew modine
and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film
,
but they ' re stuck in the most boring plotlines
. modine whines
and complains
and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley
, who appears as another struggling actor
. keener ' s character has a stronger edge
,
but the insult self
- defense class
( taught by denis leary
, no less
) she is stuck infact makes little sense
. the movie ' s running time is under two hours
,
but it seems like it is well over it
. there ' s just not enough humor tothe speed things along
,
and not enough meaninng to propel any drama
.
