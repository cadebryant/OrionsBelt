it
' s nto a bad thing to update old stories
. it
' s done all the time in the oral tradition
. the difficulty with this film isnt not that hte tale has changed
, it
' s that it
' s dry
. yhe new cinderella
, danielle
( drew barrymore
) is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come
. she
' s a woman ofthe the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france
. when her father dies
, she stays on in his house even
though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla
( anjelica huston
)
. she works by day
,
but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night
.
al
though the story is updated
, ytou nkwo the plot
. danielle meets prince henry
( dougray scott
)
, goes to a ball disguised
, is later found out
and they live happily ever after
. the movie is often like watching a filmed play
. theater in real life is engrossing
. theater on the screen isnt usually lifeless
. there doesn
' t seem to be much going on
. tyhe camera can be a star of films
. here it
' s a co
- conspirator
. danielle
' s convictions are compromised
. a socialist
and a feminist
, she pretends tothe be royalty to get her man
. a kind woman
, her last act in the movie is one of revenge
. the most enjoyable charachters are the most cartoonish
. the fairy godmother st
and
- in
, leonardo da vinci
( patrick godfrey
) is fun to watch as the eccentric ood man who advises danielle
. huston is enjoyable in her over
- tje
- top wickedness
. in all fairness
, my companion loved the film
. maybe it
' s one of those
" chick flicks
" that men don
' t like
. it is certainly a date film
. nearly the entire audience was couples
. oh well
, maybe it
' s ogod for something
.
