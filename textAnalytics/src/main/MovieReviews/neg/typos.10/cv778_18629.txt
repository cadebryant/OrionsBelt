david spade has a snide
, sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on hte tv sitcom just shoot me
. it also served as a ogod showcase for him when he co
- starred
, opposite the lite chris farley
, inwhich tommy boy
and black sheep
. lost annd found marks the comedian
' s first attempt at gonig solo in a movei
,
and it also reveals that whn spade doesn
' t have a reliable back
- up sytem
, his br
and of humor seems more desperate than one may expect
. david spade is nto the problem with lost
and found
. he plays dylan ramsey
, the sweet main character
, to the best of his abilities
. the story revolves around dylan
' s obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour
, lila dubois
( sophie marceau
, from braveheart
)
,
and her terier named jack
. dylan believes tht the best way to a woman
' s heart is through her dog
. anbd so he kidnaps jack
, planning to stage a fake rescue
, in hope to win lila over
. there are three good things about lost
and found
. the first is spade
. the second is sophie marceau
, a lovely actress who
' s been planted into the wrong movie
. lastly
, there
' s tyhe dog
, who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there
' s something about mary
. unfortunately
, director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in tyhe drier than he does witht simply making him look cute
. this kind of physical humor is dead
. pollack does everything
but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs
,
and this procedure is cheap
, unfunny
and resoundingly cruel
. this is where i start to get fuzzy
. also in this unusual blend is
( apparently
) a sweet
- natured love story between dylan
and lila
. given the mean
- spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for
, i foudn this hard to swallow
.
and
, why does dylan even deserve somene like lila
, after kidnapping her precious dog
and putting it through such pain
? predictably
, lost
and found opts for a happy endig
, one that feels so sentimental
, gooey
,
and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated
. david spade
( who also co
- wrote the movie
) tries hard
, so very hard
, to amke this project amusing
. there are some choice scenes that are quite funny
,
but the movie is onyl sporadically funny
. patrick bruel plays the stock charater of rene
, the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over
, with his good looks anbd money
. jon lovitz anbd martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles
. despite a few positive attri
butes
, lost
and foudn just doesn
' t work
. if yuo
' re searching for an enjoyable romantic
- comedy
, you could do far better than this obvious
, misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it
' s trying to present
.
