actually
, i
' m fairly sure the expeirence of having my flesh torn
and mutilated by barbed wire would have beeen more positive thna watching this movei
.
" baywatch
" babe pamela
anderson lee proves once
and for all that she should keep her double
- d
' s on the small screen
. at least there you don
' t hvae to pay to see her cleavage
.
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movei in hopes of seing pam topless
, hate to burst your bubble
,
but there are no full
- fledged nude scenes in barb wire
. you wouldn
' t be reading this review right now if i had known that fact gonig in
. i can
' t go back in time
and reverse my mistake
,
but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there
. they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless
but if she is nude
, it
' s so quick you can
' t even tell for sure whther you
' re seeing her
andersons or not
. a nipple hallucination sort of thing
. barb wire was adapted from a comic book
, interesting because pamela is probaly the only woman who looks like a comic book character inthe real life
, even wearing low
- cut leather to dont office work
( businesswoman bondage wear
)
and having unreal body proportions
. yes
, like the mona lisa
, pamela
anderson is a man
- made beauty
, probably iin more senses than one
. she is a definite beauty
,
though
,
and looking at her is never an unplesant experience
. you
' d just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn
' t have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie
, because it
' s obvious she wasn
' t pulling a sharon stone annd trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills
. i mean
, she shows off more cleavage here thna a jeweler
' s convention
. the movie is set in teh year 2017
,
" the worst year of my life
,
" pam says
.
(
" the worst movie of the year
,
" i say
.
) america is gogin thru a second civil war
and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation
( silicone valley
, i think
)
. she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right
, posing as first a stripper
and later as a prostitute
.
but don
' t call her
" babe
.
" she hates that
,
and reminds us of that fact way too many times
. imagine
, a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed onthe her being referred to in such a sexist
, demeaning term
. a liberated woman like pamela
anderson shouldn
' t have to hear words like
" babe
" during a strip tease
, especially usance that movei about the talking pig was such a succes
. the plot
( ha
- ha
) revolves around a pair ofthe contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate
' s retina scanners
. in the words of one of the characters
, they
' re
" more than meets the eye
.
" reminds me ofthe the
" transformers
" cartoon
,
and i sure wished the movei could somehow be transformed into something decent
,
but tht never happened
. no
, the movie just continued on its path of lame acation scenes starring pamela van
- damme
, big
- busted kickboxer
, adn her resistance accomplices
, ex
- boyfriend axel
( tamuera morrison
)
and cora
( victoria rowell
)
. thank god they didn
' t name her cora reef
. one bad character name is more than enough
. pamela originally doesn
' t tkae sides
, giving some speech baout she
' s only loyal to the money they pay her
,
but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother
, jack noseworthy of bon jovi
" always
" video fame
. i still don
' t know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy
,
but he definitely is nose worthy
( even if he isn
' t sponge worthy
)
. pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi
- automatic weapons
and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest
. it
' s not rambo
.
.
. it
' s bimbo
! mark my words
, barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year
. it
' s got all the elements of the direct
- to
- video releases featured on hbo
' s bastard cousin
, teh cable channel i
' d never watch if it didn
' t somehow come free
. it
' s got the non
- titillating scenes of voyeurism
, laughable flashbacks
, bad dialogue anbd action cliches out the wazzoo
. there
' s even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie
' s premise while the words scroll up the screen
. someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain
' t star wars
. if you
' ve seen any acation flick of the past fifteen years
, you
' ll recogize plenty of lifted elements
. barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over
, car crashes
, explosions
, broken glass
and slow
- motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death
. this is one of those automatic
- pilot movies anyone coudl write or direct
. barb wire has only twpo things going for it
.
.
. annd i htink you know what thsoe two things are
.
