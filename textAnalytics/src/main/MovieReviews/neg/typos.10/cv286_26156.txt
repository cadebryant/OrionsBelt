here i sit at my computer about tothe wriet my review of the recent action comedy
" bait
" starring jamie foxx
and david morse
. this is a review i don
' t even want to write because i
' d just be laying tje same criticisms on it that i would with any other so
- generic
-
and
- predictable
- it
' s
- beyond
- ridiculous piece of hollywood fluff
. if they
' re not going to give us
, the audience
, just a little credit
and put something toghether with half a brain
, why should i waste my tiome
and mental energy criticising it
? lsat summer i took this same approach whith my review of
" the mummy
,
" in that review i just quoted phrases my reviews of other sub
- par movies
. i think i shall do the same thing here
but wtih a few less quotes
( not all are applicable
)
. i hope this goes to show you what i htikn of
" bait
"
and why you can find out all you need to knwo about it wihtout having to take a wild guess
. it
' s genuinely unfunny
( i
, adn the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours
)
, unoriginal
and unthrilling
. it
' s not so bad to the point where it
' s fun to watch because of its badness
and it
' s no so bad you absolute loathe it
and are pained by watching it
, it
' s just such a cliche in
and of itself
, that
, uhh
.
.
. lost my train of
thought
. anyways
, here
' s those quotes
, enjoy
!
" getting an audience
' s attention right from the beginning plays a major role in how today
' s films work
. we want to have something exciting tothe watch
, not a slow build
- up of a story
( god forbid
!
)
, annd this film plays right into the mainstream

- review of
" armageddon
.
"
" it
' s clear the film doesn
' t want to waste time on reality
and thus the attempt to establish plausability
( the most minimal amount necessary
) comes across as a half
- assed effort
. supporting characters
and shady sup
- plots are introduced
,
but as is teh case with films made up of a large cast of characters
, only a h
andful hvea any real significance
.
.
. there
' s a fine line separating homage fomr plagiarism
