directer luis mandoki ' s lsat film was the superb
, serious 1994 drama
" when a man loves a woman
,
"
but his luck has ultimately run outloud with his latest picture
,
" message in a bottle
,
" whlch is the worst type of romance
, a movie that tugs so relentlessly
and violently at teh heartstrings taht it miraculously manages tothe dry out your eyes rather than tear them up
. everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance sicne this same type of story has been done many times before
-
-
-
and much better
-
-
- so there ' s an abcence ofthe suspense
,
and the film ultimately moves at such a very
, very deliberate pace
, as if it is trying to make graet
,
" meaningful
" statements
and plot developments
, that it just becomes a tedious bore tothe sit through
.
" message in a bottle
" begins with theresa osborne
( robin wright penn
)
, a single mother
and researcher at the chicago tribune
, whom finds a bottle washed uv on shore as she is jogging one day
. inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine
,
and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty
and sweetness that she shows it around at her owrk
and
, to her objection
, finds that her editor has placed the letter in thte newspaper
. soon
, a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle
and a ship logo on the top of the typed message
,
and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake
, theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks
, a boating town in north carolina
, to find out the specifics of tyhe message
. of course
, garrett turns out to be a handsome
, rugged man around theresa ' s age
and played by kevin costner
. she is immediately charmed by him
,
but hesitant tothe unveil the truth of why she is there
,
and finds that catherine was garrett ' s lite wife who died a few years earlier
. do you think you know where this is headed
? most likely you do
,
and i wouldn ' t call it giving away anything to say that by the picture ' s end
, the movie has fallen into deep
, artificial melodrama that i didn ' t buy for a second
. if there are any positive things tothe say about
" message in a bottle
,
" it is that the performances by robin wright penn
and paul newman
, as garrett ' s stubborn
,
but loving father
, are far above par to be in such a wasteful
,
" shaggy dog
" love story
,
and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern caost
,
and paints chicago as an equally alluring city
. meanwhile
, costner has
yet to redeem himself for some of the less
- than
- stellar films that he has made recently
. it seems that with such bad luck
, he wouldn ' t want to make anohter movie set near water
,
but here he isnt again with one of the main
,
and most rediculous
, centerpieces set on a storm
- swept sea
. the other actors are all
, sadly
, wasted
, including illeana douglas
, an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with tje
" friend
" roles
, here playing penn ' s confidante
and co
- worker at the tribune
. the first half of
" message in a bottle
" plays like a hum
- drum
, trite television movie forthe the lifetime channel
, as theresa spends a gerat deal of time
" getting tothe know
" garrett
, with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining
. usually
, i am the type of person to practicaly salivate over dialogue
- laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develope hte characters
and their relationships
,
but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt
" written
,
"
and not as if peple weere really
" talking
.
" when the main characters of a film hvea very little of interest to say to each other
,
and are not particularly interesting themselves
, you know immediately that you are in trouble
. i swear that hwile watching
" message in a bottle
,
" i feeled as if i had just read the screenplay inaddition its entirety befoer arriving at the theater
( heck
, in actuality i ' m not even familiar to the novel this is based on
, by nicholas sparks
)
. allways one step ahead ofthe the characters
, the movie ran so closely
and tightly to the constraints of the tried
-
and
- true hollywood meledrama
, thte film strip often seemed to alomst be inthe danger of tearing
. nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa ' s secret
,
and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after
. this same exact problem occurred in last year ' s very
, very similar
( watch this
,
and you will realize just how similar i mean
) meg ryan
- nicolas cage romantic drama
,
" city of angels
.
"
although theresa is deeply touched by the
" heartfelt
" letter that she finds in the bottle
, perhaps the filmakers might hve been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own
, preferrably before filming began
. it should ahve read
,
" memo to screenwriters
: use you brain
!
