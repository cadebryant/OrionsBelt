' s last film was tje superb
, serious 1994 drama
" when a man loves a woman
,
"
but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture
,
" message in a bottle
,
" which is the worst type of romance
, a movie that tugs so relentlessly
and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry outloud your eyes rather than tear them up
. everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type ofthe story has been done many times before
-
-
-
and much better
-
-
- so there
' s an absence of suspense
, anbd the film ultimately moves at such a very
, very deliberate pace
, as if it is trying to make great
,
" meaningful
" statements
and plot developments
, that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through
.
" message in a bottle
" begins with theresa osborne
( robin wright penn
)
, a single mother
and researcher at yhe chicago tribune
, whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day
. inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine
,
and theresa is so tooked aback by its honesty
and sweetness that she shows it around at her work annd
, to her objection
, finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper
. soon
, a heavy research is conducted to find out who wroet the letter based onthe the type of bottle
and a ship logo on the top of the typed message
, annd after it is traced to a man named garrett blake
, theresa finds herself traveling tothe the outer banks
, a boating town in north carolina
, to find out the specifics of the message
. of course
, garrett turns out to be a h
andsome
, rugged man around theresa
' s age annd played by kevin costner
. she is immediately charmed by him
,
but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there
, adn finds that catherine was garrett
' s late wife who died a few years earlier
. do you think you nkow where this is headed
? most likely you do
,
and i wouldn
' t call it giving away anything to say that by the picture
' s end
, tghe movie has fallen into deep
, artificial melodrama that i didn
' t buy for a second
. if there are any positve things to say about
" message in a bottle
,
" it isnt thyat thte performances by robin wright penn
and paul newman
, as garrett
' s stubborn
,
but loving father
, are far above par tothe be in such a wasteful
,
" shaggy dog
" love story
,
and tht the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes graet advantage of the beautiful eastern coast
,
and paints chicago as an equally alluring city
. meanwhile
, costner hasnt yot to redeem himselv for some of the less
- than
- stellar films that he has made recently
. it seems that with such bad luck
, he wouldn
' t want to amking another movie set near water
, bu here he is again witht one of the main
, adn most rediculous
, centerpieces set on a storm
- swept sea
. tghe otehr actors are all
, sadly
, wasted
, including illeana douglas
, an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the
" friend
" roles
, here playing penn
' s confidante
and co
- worker at the tribune
. tje first half of
" message in a bottle
" plays like a hum
- drum
, trite television movie for the liftime channel
, as theresa spends a great deal of time
" getting to know
" garrett
, with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining
. usually
, i am the type of person tothe practically salivate over dialogue
- laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters
and their relationships
,
but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt
" written
,
"
and not as if people were really
" talking
.
" wehn the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other
,
and are nto particularly interesting themselves
, you know immediately that you are inspite trouble
. i swear that while watching
" message in a bottle
,
" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater
( heck
, in actuality i
' m nto even familiar to the novel this is based on
, by nicholas sparks
)
. always one step ahead of the characters
, the movie ran so closely
and tightly to the constraints of the tried
-
and
- true hollywood melodrama
, the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing
. nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa
' s secret
,
and that several obstacles will come within thier ways ofthe living happily ever after
. this same exact problem occurred in last year
' s very
, vrey similar
( watch this
,
and you will relize just how similar i mean
) meg ryan
- nicolas cage rumatic drama
,
" city ofthe angels
.
"
al
though theresa is deeply touched by the
" heartfelt
" letter that she finds in tyhe bottle
, perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own
, preferably before filming began
. it should have read
,
" memo to screenwriters
: use you brain
!
