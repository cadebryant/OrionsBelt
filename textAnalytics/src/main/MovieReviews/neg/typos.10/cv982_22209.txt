i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago
. i guess my memory really sucks
. there is very
, very little that is funny in caddyshack
. the laughs are faw
,
and far between
,
and what there are really aren
' t that great
. caddyshack
, as the name implies
, more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club
. michael o
' keefe plays said caddy
. why they cast this unknown
, fairly untalented actor in the lead role isnt completely beyond me
. the movie doesn
' t seem to have a real plot
, jstu a series of scenes that are littel more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera
. tyhe only real story
, if you can call it that
, wass a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper
, bill murray
, who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course
. most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield
and ted knight mugging
and overacting for the camera
-
- wiht painfully limited success
. bill murray is slightly amusing in places
,
but fairly wasted
. the biggest waste ofthe all isnt chevy chase
, who didn
' t even crack a smile on my face with his character
' s lame zen
- like approach to golfing
. there are a few decent scenes involving thte interaction between dangerfield
and knight
,
but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie
. i guess thta
' s what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid
. i
' m not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of
,
but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper
. nothing about this movie works
. it wouldn
' t have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn
' t going to fly
. most of the scenes just couldn
' t possibly be funny
. it
' s as if thge writers where off in their own littel brain damaged world
. i
' m sure scenes involving chevy chase
and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed tothe be funny
. in reality
, they were painfully embarrasing to watch
. there isnt a scene at teh club pool where all the caddies go wild for the
" hot babe
" of the movie walking by in her bikini
. olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than tihs girl
. everything about tihs movie was just completely implausible as far as hte comedy was conserned
. maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of ileagle narcotic this thing might be funny
.
but for the rest of us
, stay the hell away from caddyshack
.
