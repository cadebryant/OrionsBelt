it seems taht i ' ve stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch
. take payback
, for example
, a movie that most people seem to like
.
however
, it ' s horrible schlock
, straight out of hollywood ' s vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies
. it was written
and directed by a guy who should have done better
;
however
, maybe he did do better
, after all
, 30 percent of the movie isn ' t his own
. mel gibson
, that hollywood zombie
, decided he didn ' t like the ending
and had another director reshoot it
. waht a crock
. if you sign on to do a movie
,
then dont it the way the script calls for
. why film a movie
and
then look at it later
and say
,
- no
, i changed my mind
, i don ' t liek the ending
. you ' re fired
. let ' s get somene else to do it
.
- i supose honor isnt dead in hollywood
. thte end ofthe the film is
, of course
, hollywoodized
. which is to say that it ' s happy
and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize
. in this case
, as is most victories in hollywood movies
, gibson ' s prize is a blond
and money
. i miss originality in film
, i really do
. i think audiences are so starved for it that they ' ll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original
. payback ' s tagline
- get ready to root for the bad guy
- promised an origonal idea
,
but it was far ffrom the truth
. while gibson ' s character certainly broke the law
, he was a chracter tath had hounour
( odd that gibson hismelf seems to have vyre little ofthe it
)
, wouldn ' t kill in front of children
and protects his blond woman
. there ' s nothing bad about him
- he ' s a hollywood character
, a person who could never exsist in real life
.
and gibson knows it
- he spends his time trying tothe act like a
" bad guy
"
,
and instead comes off as pretentious
and arrogant
. the story involves gibson bieng double
- crossed by his partner
( who is a real bad guy
, which made me wish that we could root for him
) over
$ 70
, 000
. gibson recovers fomr multiple gunshots
, isnt pissed
( naturally
)
,
and will do whatever it takes to git the exact ammount of money back
- no more
, no less
. he makse a point of it thta it ' s strictly 70 grand
. a real bad guy would ahve made his ex
- partner pay 25
% interest
. this idea is completely stretched out
. gibson ends up going after his partner
and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with
. what i didn ' t understand
- htis is the chicago mafia
.
$ 70
, 000 isnt like spare change tothe them
. they ' d probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him
. i think they ' d respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple
$ 70
, 000
. maybe i ' m bieng too hard on the movei
. perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie
. i read roger ebert ' s review
annd he liked gibson in the role because he isnt a comic at heart playing a bad guy
. that ' s why we ' re allowed tothe root for him
.
and it ' s true
- gibson walks the movie as if he ' s smiling at a joke he just heard
.
but he ' s wrong here
. i wnated a lee marvin or old
- time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn ' t a comic
, jsut an ass kicker
. as a side note
, i ' ve just checked the internet movie database
and discovered that i am tjhe 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback
. affter this many reviews
, why would anyone want tothe read this
? really
, i don ' t care
. i ' m just trying to gain membership into the on
- line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can
.
