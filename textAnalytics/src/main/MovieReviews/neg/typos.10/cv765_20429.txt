it seems that i
' ve stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch
. tkae payback
, for example
, a movie that most peopel seem to like
.
however
, it
' s horrible schlock
, straight out of hollywood
' s vast talent forthe sucking creativity out ofthe movies
. it was written
and directed by a guy who should have done better
;
however
, maybe he did dont better
, after all
, 30 percent of yhe movie isn
' t his own
. mel gibson
, that hollywood zombie
, decided he didn
' t like the ending
and had another director reshoot it
. what a crock
. if you sign on tothe do a movie
,
then do it the way the script calls for
. why film a movie
and
then look at it later
and say
,
- no
, i changed my mind
, i don
' t like the ending
. you
' re fired
. let
' s get someone eles to do it
.
- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood
. the end of the film isnt
, of course
, hollywoodized
. which is to say that it
' s happy
and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize
. in this case
, as is most victories infact hollywood movies
, gibson
' s prize is a blond
and money
. i miss originality iin film
, i really do
. i think audiences are so starved fo it that tehy
' ll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original
. payback
' s tagline
- get ready to root for the bad guy
- promised an original idea
,
but it was far from the truth
. while gibson
' s character certainly broke the law
, he was a character that had hounour
( odd tht gibson himself seems tothe have very little of it
)
, wouldn
' t kill in front of children
and protects his blond woman
. there
' s nothing bad about him
- he
' s a hollywood character
, a person who could never exist in real life
.
and gibson knows it
- he spends his time trying to act like a
" bad guy
"
, adn instead comes off as pretentious
and arrogant
. thte storey involves gibson being double
- crossed by his partner
( who is a real bad guy
, which made me wish that we could root for him
) over
$ 70
, 000
. gibson recovers from mutiple gunshots
, is pissed
( naturally
)
, annd will do whatever it tkaes to get the exact amount of money back
- noone more
, no less
. he makes a point of it tht it
' s strictly 70 gr
and
. a real bad guy would have made his ex
- partner pay 25
% interest
. this idea is completely stretched out
. gibson ends up going after his partner
and yhe chicago mafia that his partner isnt affiliated with
. what i didn
' t underst
and
- this is hte chicago mafia
.
$ 70
, 000 isnt like spare change to them
. they
' d probablly just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him
. i think they
' d respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple
$ 70
, 000
. maybe i
' m being too hard on the movie
. perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie
. i read roger ebert
' s review
and he liekd gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy
. that
' s why we
' re allowed tothe root for him
.
and it
' s true
- gibson walks yhe movei as if he
' s smiling at a joke he just heard
.
but he
' s wrong here
. i wanted a lee marvin or old
- time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn
' t a comic
, just an ass kicker
. as a side note
, i
' ve just checked the internet movei database
and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback
. after this many reviews
, why would anyone want to read this
? really
, i don
' t care
. i
' m jstu trying to gain membership into the onthe
- line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can
.
