summer movies are
, by nature
, dumb affairs thgat are usually made for some quick enjoyment
and to make money
. wild wild west
, the latest iwll smith affair
, follows much the same formula
, except thgat it is dumber
and less enjoying than most summer movies
. will smith plays jim west
, a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglases
. he is called by president grant
( kline
) to go on a mission to find out why top govornment scientists are disappearing
. west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon
( kline agian
)
and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind
, named dr
. loveless
( branagh
, wiht a zany moustache
.
) before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair
, i
' ll give it a chance with the positives
. there
' s a nice credit sequence
, the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye
,
and the special effects are decent enough
. there
' s also a pleasant soundtrack
. buried deep in tyhe dross are oney or two amusing jokes
.
and salma hayek pops up as the female interest
, which is always nice to see
. apart from these factors
,
though
, nothing else in wild wild west works
. firstly
, there
' s little chemistry bewteen smith
and kline
, who appears to be infront it purely for the money
. one would expect zingers passing between the two
: none arise
. both of them plod through the below st
andard plot
, knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end
. not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment
: altough he is over the top
, the material doesn
' t present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy
. therefore
, he jstu comes across as loud as obnoxious
. the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek
, who is given so little screen time it
' s embarrassing
. she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body
,
and be ogled at by kline
and smith
. her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics ofthe the script
,
and there is no sense of realism about thge character
. the
' humour
' in the film is also very off
. will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black
, here
, not even smith could save hte humour on display
. the script largely boils down to insults that aren
' t very funny
,
and one
- liners that barely raise a smirk
. it
' s also somewhat racist
,
al
though it doesn
' t intend to be
, with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching
,
and actually says slavery is good to save himself
. it
' s not a funny scene
,
and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably
. the film also makes the tradgic mistake tyhat a man
( in this case kline
) in a dress is automatically unfunny
, it isn
' t
,
but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness
. there
' s also problems with the plot
. jim west
and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations
,
but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying
,
and rely purely on luck
, rather than audeince pleasing skill
. plot elements are itnroduced inot the film
, anbd
then thrown awya just as quickly
. the main piece of the story
, a 80 foot mechanical
, steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive
,
but there
' s no particular reason why it should be built
. why not loveless build a great big tank
, instead of an ungainly
, fragel piece of machinery that
' s jsut begging tothe be blown uv
? director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them
, with smoe nice camera tricks
,
but even thsi isnt missing from tihs stilted afair
. wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing
,
but not much of it is evident
, makeing this film drag outloud even more
. it
' s a sad thing whn
_ four
_
( credited
) screenwriters
, a talented director
and a willing star cant
' t make a film work
,
and eventually wild wild west collapses under it
' s sexist
, mildly racist
, unfunny weight
.
