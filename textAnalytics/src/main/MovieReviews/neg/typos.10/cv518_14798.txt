well
, as i check my score kard for what i
' ve done this holiday weekend
, it reads good ideas
: 0
and dumb ideas
: 1
. i don
' t know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie
. bu in my defense
, i can only say that it ws someone else who urged me to see tihs with him
. the film that i
' m talking about is
` a nght at the roxbury
,
' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit
. wayne
and garth
, these two are not
. rather
, we meet doug
and steve
butabi
( the actors
' names are not worth mentioning
)
, two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way tothe get into the hottest night club in the city
, the roxbury
. driving in their dad
' s bmw
and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice
, they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club
.
` have you met my friend washington adn his friend roosevelt
,
' they confidently sday as they pull out spare pocket change
. their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick
- up lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl
(
` let me see that label
. just as i
thought
- made inthe heaven
,
' says one of the brothers
)
.
and
, like the losers that they are
, they fail to do either for much of the film
.
however
, as fate would have it
, an accidental meeting with
` what
- ever
- happened
- to
' richard grieco gives them the all
- important ticket to git in
. their sad lives take on a whole new direction
. they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene
.
and they are mistaken as rich swingers by twpo voluptuous young women
.
but their newfound popularity does not impress their father
, who has other plans for them
. the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one
- joke movie
,
and the brothers are the joke
. actaully
, there
' s baout 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff
. alas
, too long for tv
and way too short for a feature
- lenght film
. thus
, there just isn
' t enough material to sustain the 83
- minute movie
. there
' s no plot to be found
and everything that these twpo do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway
' s europop song
, what is love
. i was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash
. to take up more film time
, there isnt a subplot involving the daughter of the buisnessman next door who wnats to marry doug
. thsi creates not onyl friction between the brothers
,
but their unlikely pairing wiull aslo aitate audience members as well
. she
' s educated
and a forebearing witch
. meanwhile
, doug is a complete loser
. how did theese twpo ever get toghether
? i suppose that if i can ever figure outloud the answer to thta question
, i
' ll have figured out why i decided to go
and see this movie
. if you
' re looking for entertainment
, you won
' t find it at the roxbury
.
