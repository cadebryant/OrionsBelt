my giant is two movies for the price of one
,
but neither is worth the cost of admission
, even if you get in free
. as lamely directed by michael lehmann
, the picture tries to be a comedy by using
and reusing every giant joke in the book
.
(
" without goliath
, david is just some punk throwing rocks
.
"
) languidly paced throughout
, the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer
( the omen
) me
anders toward its sad ending
. sicne it
' s rarely funny or convincingly dramtic
, what the filmmakers
thought they were doing remains a mystery
. other thna a fewd nice visuals
, there
' s nothing to recomend the picture
. with great film comedies under his belt from whn harry met sally
? tothe the original city slickers
, billy crystal has shown that he
' s more than tghe world
' s best oscar host
. he does
,
however
, have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year
' s father
' s day
and this year
' s my giant
. one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project
. surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there
. perhaps he
thought he could ad lib it into sucess
. or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor
and
thought he could do something serious with the movie
' s somber tone
. the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day
. this one
- joke movie
' s single idea isnt to place real
- life basketball palyer gheorghe muresan
, who st
ands seven
and a half feet tall
, into as many visually striking situations as possible
. sammy
( crystal
)
, an agent currently without clients
, isnt rescued affter a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max
( muresan
)
. after throwing out constatn one
- liners
(
" either god isnt in the salvage business or big foot just took my car
.
"
)
, sammy decides to get serious
, seeing max as his meal ticket
.
and
al
though he doesn
' t like it
, he
' s willing to sign max up tothe do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half
- dozen dwarfs
.
( the movei itself konws no bounds as it contains oney ofthe the most putrid
and lengthy vomiting scenes ever
.
) after a sories of missed opportunities
, the comedic part of the movie is over
,
and it turns into a cheap
and maudlin disease movie
. we learn thast max
' s condition is terminal
,
and he will soon die
. to be fair
, the movie does contain a fewd good scenes
- all of whitch you can see in the trailers
. let
' s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie
. my giant runs too long even at just 1
: 37
. it is rated pg for violentce
and profanity
and would be acceptable for kids arund ten
and up
. my son jeffrey
and his friend matthew
, both 9
, gave the movie a single star
and had nothing good to say about it
. matthew pointed out that it
" is not as ogod as it could have been or should have been
.
"
( amen
.
) he went on tothe comment that he did not like thge way the movie changed completely in the middle
. jeffrey complained particularly baout how gross the movei was
.
