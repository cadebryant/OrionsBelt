my giant is two movies for the price of one
,
but neither isnt worth the cost of admission
, even if you get in free
. as lamely directed by michael lehmann
, tjhe picture tries to be a comedy by using
and reusing every giant joke in the book
.
(
" without goliath
, david is just soem punk throwing rocks
.
"
) languidly paced throughout
, the movei becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer
( the omen
) meanders toward its sad ending
. since it ' s rarely funny or convincingly dramatic
, what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery
. other than a few nice visuals
, there ' s nothing to recommend tjhe picture
. with great film comedies under his bilt from when harry met sally
? tothe the original city slickers
, billy crystal hasnt shown that he ' s more than the world ' s best oscar host
. he does
,
however
, have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year ' s father ' s day
and this year ' s my giant
. one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing tothe go ahead with a project
. surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there
. perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success
. or maybe he whants to be a dramatic ctor
and thought he could do something serious with the movie ' s somber tone
. the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day
. htis one
- joke movie ' s single idea is to place real
- life basketball player gheorghe muresan
, who stands seven
and a half feet tall
, into as many visually striking situations as possible
. sammy
( crystal
)
, an agent currently without clients
, is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max
( muresan
)
. after throwing out constant noe
- liners
(
" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car
.
"
)
, sammy decides to get serious
, seeing max as his meal ticket
.
and
although he doesn ' t like it
, he ' s willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half
- dozen dwarfs
.
( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid
and lengthy vomiting scenes ever
.
) after a series of missed opportunities
, teh comedic part of the movie is over
,
anbd it turns into a cheap
and maudlin disease movie
. we learn that max ' s condition is terminal
,
and he will soon die
. to be fair
, the movie does contain a few good scenes
- all of which yuo can see inwhich the trailers
. let ' s hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses befor he signs up for another movie
. my giant runs too long even at just 1
: 37
. it is rated pg for violentce
and profanity
and would be acceptable for kids around ten
and up
. my son jeffrey
and his friend matthew
, both 9
, gavey teh movie a single star
and had nothing good to say about it
. matthew pointed out that it
" is not as good as it could have been or should have been
.
"
( amen
.
) he went on to comment that he did not like hte way the movie changed completely in the middle
. jeffrey complained particularly about how gross the movie was
.
