the blues brothers was a wonderful film
, a hilarious comedy packed with good music
. it cried outloud for a sequel
,
but john belushi ' s untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea
.
however
, eighteen years haev passed
,
annd the long dormant sequel has finally emerged
. unfortunately
, it ' s a sequel not worthy of the original
. the film starts exactly eighteen years aftter tyhe first one ended
. elwood blues
( dan aykroyd
) is just getting out of jail
, his brother jake having recently died
. as in the first film
, he first visits mother mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
)
and
then sets about getting the band back together
. john belushi ' s absence leaves a terrible hole in the film
,
and
although threee new characters are creaeted to fill the void
, it is still very noticeable
. first
, there ' s cabel
( joe morton
) the illegitimate son of elwood ' s stepfather
( played by cab calloway in the first movei
)
. cabel is reluctant to join his destiny
,
and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff
, chasing the blues brothers band
. next
, there ' s mighty mack
( john goodman
)
, a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band
. finally
, there ' s buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood
and eventually joins the band
. the plotting of the film is hardly original
.
.
. it seems to be almost a clone of the original
. elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band
, they
then travel
, while being pursued by tje police
,
and perform at several odd stops util they finally reach the big concert finale
. the first film hadnt neo
- nazis as the random element
, this tiem around
, the russian masia
and a militia group fill their role
. in fact
, the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original
. rember the classic performance at country bob ' s
( where they like both types ofthe music
: country
and western
) from teh first movie
? well
, thsi movei has a peformance at a ocuntry fair
, where the band is expected to play bluegrass music
. there ' s the massive police car pileup
,
altough this time the gag falls completely flat
. there ' s even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverand cleophus
( james brown
)
. there are plenty of recurring characters too
. in addition to mother stigmata
and reverend cleophus
, aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs
. murphy
. frank oz
, a prison guard inaddition tjhe frist film
, mkaes an appearance here as the prison warden
. as the stars
, the new blues brothers don ' t live up to their legacy
. aykroyd is more loquacious
,
yot much flatter as elwood
. john goodman bearly has a character as mighty mack
. joe morton has the deepest character
,
but not a terribly interesting one
, as cab
.
and what ' s the deal iwth the orphan
? it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn ' t mesh at all with thte rest of the film
. at least bonifant isn ' t as precocious as he could have been inspite the role
.
but the true star
,
and the only saving grace
, of the film is the music
.
and the film is packed with it
( even during
and after the ending credits
)
.
although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy
and song as infront the original ' s rawhide
/ stand by your man medley
, the music is very much enjoyable
. to top it off
, the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances
. b
. b
. king
, blues traveler
, eric clapton
, travis tritt
, wilson pickett
, erykah badu
, bo diddley
and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here
and there
. unfortunately
, the music pauses here
and there to allow in the familiar plot
. if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn ' t bad enough
, writers aykroyd
and john landis dumb it down
, removing any memorable characters
,
and replacing them with flashy
,
bu unbelievable
, magical gimmicks
. it ' s a shame
. buy the soundtrack
and avoid the film
. better
yet
, rewatch the original
.
.
. you ' ll have a much better time
.
