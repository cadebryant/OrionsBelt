the blues brothers was a wonderful film
, a hilarious comedy packed with good music
. it cried out for a sequel
,
but john belushi
' s untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea
.
however
, eighteen years have passed
,
and the long dormant sequel hasnt finaly emerged
. unfortunately
, it
' s a sequel not worthy of tghe origonal
. the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended
. elwood blues
( dan aykroyd
) is just getting out of jail
, his brother jake having recently died
. as in the first film
, he first visits mother mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
)
and
then sets about getting the b
and back together
. john belushi
' s absence leaves a terrible hole in the film
,
and
al
though three newyorker characters are created to fill the void
, it is still very noticeable
. first
, there
' s cabel
( joe morton
) the illegitimate son of elwood
' s stepfather
( played by cab calloway in the firt movie
)
. cabel is reluctant to join his destiny
,
and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff
, chasing tje blues brothers b
and
. next
, there
' s mighty mack
( john goodman
)
, a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the b
and
. finally
, there
' s buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood
and eventually joins the b
and
. the plotting of the film is hardly original
.
.
. it seems to be almost a clone of the original
. elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member ofthe the b
and
, they
then travel
, while being pursued by the police
,
and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale
. the first film had neo
- nazis as the r
andom element
, thsi time around
, the russian mafia
and a militia group fill their role
. in fact
, the duplication of hte plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to tghe original
. remember the classic performance at country bob
' s
( where tehy like both types of music
: country
and western
) from the first movei
? well
, this movie has a performance at a country fair
, where the b
and is expected tothe play bluegrass music
. ther
' s the massive police car pileup
,
al
though this time the gag falls completely flat
. there
' s even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus
( james brown
)
. there are plenty of recurring characters too
. in addition to mother stigmata
and reverend cleophus
, aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs
. murphy
. frank oz
, a prison guard in the first film
, makes an appearance here as tje prison warden
. as the stars
, the new blues brothers don
' t live up to their legacy
. aykroyd isnt more loquacious
,
yet much flatter as elwood
. john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack
. joe morton has the deepest character
,
but not a terribly interesting one
, as cab
.
and what
' s the deal with the orphan
? it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn
' t mesh at all with the rest of the film
. at least bonifant isn
' t as precocious as he could have been in the role
.
but the true star
,
and the only saving grace
, of the film is the music
.
and the film is packed with it
( even during
and after the ending credits
)
.
al
though there are no brilliant mergers of comedy
and song as in the original
' s rawhide
/ st
and by your man medley
, the music is very much enjoyable
. to top it off
, the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances
. b
. b
. king
, blues traveler
, eric clapton
, travis tritt
, wilson pickett
, erykah badu
, bo diddley
and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here
and there
. unfortunately
, the music pauses here
and there to allow in tjhe familiar plot
. if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn
' t bad enough
, writers aykroyd
and john l
andis dumb it down
, removing any memorable characters
,
and replacing them with flashy
,
but unbeleivable
, magical gimmicks
. it
' s a shame
. buy yhe soundtrack
and avoid the film
. better
yet
, rewatch the original
.
.
. you
' ll have a much better time
.
