the crown jewel of 1970
' s irwin allen disaster movies
, the poseidon adventure features an all
- star cast inlcuding ginee hackman
and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship
. the story begins on the u
. s
. s
. poseidon
' s big new year
' s cruise
, where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only pasengers left alive
. let
' s see
, ther
' s the new age preacher
( hackman
) who advises people to
" pray to that part of god within yourself
.
" there
' s the ex
- cop
( borgnine
) who busted a hooker
( stella stevens
) six times
-
- thn married her
. there
' s thte hippie singer
(
" there
' s got to be a morning after
.
.
.
"
) who turns to the comapany ofthe a lonly man
( red
buttons
) once her brother is killed
.
and to round out the group
: the elderly couple
( jack albertson
and shelley winters
) who live aboard the ship
, the beautiful teenage girl
and her brother who are sailing alone
and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall
. we get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure
, before straight
- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship
. everyone
' s in teh giant ballroom at the time
, shortly past midnight of the new year
, when yhe ship turns first on its side
,
then completely upside down
. the second
- in
- comm
and wants everyone tothe wait in the ballroom until help arrives
,
but rebel hackman leads his small b
and of followers on a quest to thte top of the ship
. in this case
, because the ship is overturned
, the top is the bottom
. or is the bottom the top
? either way
, we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautifull women in tyhe crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during tjhe scenes where the camera shoots upwards hwile they climb uv ladders
and
-
- in the ballroom scene
-
- christmas trees
. thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridoors
, through burning rooms
, etc
. while the ship slowly fills with water behind them
. it
' s a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting
. the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at
, with all the melodrama that comes in
- between the non
- thrilling action scenes
. the one note in borgnine
' s one
- note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while
buttons anbd the hippie fall in love
(
al
though since ther isn
' t a sex scene
, we never fidn out if his
buttons really are red
)
and albertson
and winters wonder if they
' ll live to see their gr
andson
' s birth
. shelley winters provides tyhe most hilarious scene in the movie inaddition a scene toward the end
, where water has flooded the enxt two rooms of the ship
and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest ofthe them to pull along
. winters
, who has been the whiny fat woman throughout teh movie
( stevens even not
- so
- affectionately calls her
" fatass
" infact one scene
)
, finally finds her purpose
.
" i was thge underwater swimming champ of newyorker york threee years running when i was seventeen
,
" she brags
,
and before hackman cant even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years
, she
' s swimming through the water
, her skirt billowing uv around her hips
, showing off her cellulite
( or do you call it shellulite
?
) ridden thighs
. it
' s not so much funny as innately disgusting
, whcih pretty much sums uv the poseidon adventure as a whole
.
