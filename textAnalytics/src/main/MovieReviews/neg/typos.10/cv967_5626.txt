the crown jewel of 1970 ' s irwin allen disaster movies
, the poseidon adventure features an all
- star cast including gene hackman
and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship
. the story begins on the u
. s
. s
. poseidon ' s big new year ' s cruise
, where we are introduced to the ensemble ofthe people who will soon be the only passengers left alive
. let ' s see
, there ' s the new age preacher
( hackman
) who advises people to
" pray to that part of god within yourself
.
" there ' s the ex
- cop
( borgnine
) who busted a hooker
( stella stevens
) six times
-
-
then married her
. there ' s the hippie singer
(
" there ' s got to be a morning after
.
.
.
"
) who turns to the company of a lonely man
( red buttons
) once her brother is killed
.
and to round out the group
: tyhe elderly couple
( jack albertson
and shelley winters
) who live aboard tghe ship
, the beautiful teenage girl
and her brother who are sailing alone
and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall
. we git to know theese people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure
, before straight
- faced ship captian leslie nielson looks iin horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship
. everyone ' s in tjhe giant ballroom at the time
, shortly past midnight ofthe the new yera
, when the ship turns first on its side
,
then completely upside down
. the second
- in
- command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom unil help arrives
,
but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship
. in this case
, because tjhe ship is overturned
, the top is the bottom
. or is the bottom the top
? either way
, we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders
and
-
- in the ballroom scene
-
- christmas trees
. thus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors
, thru burning rooms
, etc
. while the ship slowly fills with water behind them
. it ' s a race against the clock which is onyl mildly interesting
. the poseidon adventure works more as a bad movei to laugh at
, with all the melodrama that comes in
- between the non
- thrilling acation scenes
. the one note in borgnine ' s one
- note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman eveyr step of the way while buttons
and the hippie fall in love
(
although since there isn ' t a sex scene
, we never find out if his buttons really are red
)
and albertson
adn winters wonder if they ' ll live to see their grandson ' s birth
. shelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end
, where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship
and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope forthe the rest of them to pull along
. winters
, who has been the whiny fat woman throughout yhe movie
( stevens even not
- so
- affectionately calls her
" fatass
" in one scene
)
, finally finds her purpose
.
" i was the underwater swimming champ of new york threee years running when i was seventeen
,
" she brags
,
and before hackman cin even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years
, she ' s swimming through the water
, her skirt billowing up around her hips
, showing off her cellulite
( or do you call it shellulite
?
) ridden thighs
. it ' s not so much funny as innately disgusting
, which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a hwole
.
