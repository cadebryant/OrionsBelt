affter the huge success of
" the exorcist
" in 1973 a sequel was inevitable
,
and sadly like most horror fims thgat make money
, tje filmmakers decided to make a ridiculous sequel
, that makes absolutely no sense at all
,
and tothe me was extremely pointless
, wasting linda blair
and max von sydow completely
. needless
, dumb sequel flopped in thge box office
,
and never gained much success
though it is voted as one of the worst sequels of all time
, to which i agree with
. to start the
" story
" it isnt four years later
,
and regan is being tormented by memories of what used to be
, now a priest played by richard burton
, is trying to figure out why this demon tried to possess regan
,
and now the demon somehow wants to posess her again
( maybe she was good or something
)
. now they must try tothe stop this demon from tkaing over regan
' s body
, before it is too lite
. smoe of the bad things exorcist ii has in it isnt
: linda blair
, she had no need to revive her character
,
and she isnt raelly terrable in this film
, she brings it down tothe a lull
,
and in places it seems like it just stops in its palce
,
and doesn
' t go anyhwere
. louise fletcher isnt alright for what it
' s worth
,
but she could hve done a lot better than thsi
. the direction by john boorman
, isnt that of a confused
, stylish nature that i really couldn
' t figure out
. in fact
, i had no idea what was going on in this film
, the script was jumbled
, the plot was jumbled
,
and the ending is just laff out loud hilariosly bad
. for those exorcist fans who haven
' t seen this one
, i reccomend renting it
. i accually gave this one a high rating
, if it were any worse it would have deserved zero pumpkins
, i went easy on it
however because of the fact that it has a bit of good direction
,
but nothing else
! im not saying i like the film now
, so dont start going anywhere
. bad
, bad
, bad movie
.
