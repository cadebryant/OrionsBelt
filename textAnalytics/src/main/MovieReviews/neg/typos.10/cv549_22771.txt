cradle will rock isnt the latest effort from director
/ actor tim robbins
. while he may have had an oscar worthy film back inaddition 1995
( dead man walking
)
, he gets a little overconfident
and sloppy here
. the story is confusing
,
and filled with many subplots
, so i
' ll try my best
and explain it as simpley as possible
. yhe film is based on a
" mostly
" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s
, that produced a play
( the cradle wiull rock
) that apparently was offensive to some
, so the government shuts it down
. it
' s durring thte time of the depression
,
and all htis theater wants to do is entertain
and cheer up those who do not have jobs
, or are poor
. between thsi conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots
, baout those who work in theater
, or those associated
. also allong the way are soem other messages mashed together to create an even moreso overwelming experience
. tim robbin
' s just keeps piling on political views
, annd characters
, that we just give up on the film
, or in some cases walk out
. fo robbin
' s it may be a nice achievement
,
but to me it seemed moreso like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue
,
and fancy outfits
. i
thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outst
anding casted
, unfortunately are all uninteresting
, exept for a few
. let me recap what each important character does
, so please bear iwth me
( it
' s the least you can do
, especially if you were concidering seeing this
)
. i
' ll begin iwth those involved with the play
. there
' s orson welles
( angus macfadyen
) who of course is thge director of the play
, hte producer john houseman
( cary elwes
)
, marc blitzstein
( hank azaria
) the writer of the play
, emily watson
, a woman who gets her break by playing the main part inspite cradle will rock
. outside tghe play there
' s the
: ventriloquist
( bill murray
) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk
( joan cusack
)
, anohter subplot involving a painter diego rivera
( ruben blades
) who
' s unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage
( john cusack
)
. there
' s a few other actresses
and actors who have their own stories
( susan sar
andon
, philip baker hall too name a few
)
but those that i mentioned
, were the most significant to the story
. anyway
, most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted
, except for emily watson
, who does another great job
,
and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack
, who always delivers through thick
and thin
. now
al
though most ofthe the film was weak tothe say teh least
, there were some nice moments
and some involving subjects
,
but all this is overblown
. sure the free speech segment was a nice feature
,
but not when it becomes repetitive
. the whole film is like this
,
and it
' s basically nothing bu a headache
. on the brighter side
, tim robbin
' s direction was masterful
. his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas
anderson
' s latest magnolia
, only smoother in my opinyon
,
but even that can
' t make a movie that much better
.
al
though it has it
' s moments
( not many of them
,
but they
' re there
)
, cradle iwll rock stays true to it
' s title
, because the cradle rocked too far
and tipped over
.
