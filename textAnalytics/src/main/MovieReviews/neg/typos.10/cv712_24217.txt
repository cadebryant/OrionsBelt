preposterous religious action film
( produced by the trinity broadcasting network
) about a code hidden within the text of the bible thast when deciphered wiull lead to the end of the world
( nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into hte most read book ever eh
?
)
. michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code
and sets out to become god on earth
and fulfill the doomsday prophecies
, while casper van dien
( terribly miscast
and giving an awful performance as a result
) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him
. michael ironside
( great as always
, despite the silly film surrounding him
) plays a fallen priest
and right h
and man tothe michael york
' s character
. here
' s some subtle character devolopement you may have missed pertaining to ironside
' s character
. now despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the oppening scene
, the filmmakers aren
' t quite sure if their audience will underst
and that he is evil
. how do they fix that
? make specific efforts to show that his character isnt the only one in the film who smokes
! there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking
.
.
. oooooo scary
. bu even that wasn
' t enough for tje filmmakers apparently
, as htey later have tothe infer that ironside
' s character is gay
! it comes out of nowhere
and just makes noone sense
. my main problem with this film isnt that
, despite the silly story
( which could have been pulled off
.
.
. anything can be made believable if executed correctly
)
, teh events of the film aren
' t shown with any sense of urgency or importance
. for example
, at one point york
' s character isnt declared chancellor ofthe the world or something
,
and we see one breef
, cheesy news report about it
. the movie keeps telling us taht the apocalypse is coming
,
but it never seems that way
. there
' s noone
" world reaction
" to anything
. the omega code is available onthe dvd from goodtimes home video
. it contains the film in yhe original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
,
and includes the original theatrical trailer
, a documentary on the making ofthe the film
, production notes
,
and cast
and crew information
. the documentary runs about 25 minutes
and is actually surprisingly good
( it looks as
though it was made for broadcast onthe tbn
)
,
and it does a comprehensive job of interviewing practically everyone inthe teh cast
and crew
( with the exception of michael ironside
, unfortunately
)
. the best thnig about it is that whenever crew members are interviewed
, they do an excellent job ofthe explaining theri profession
and exactly what it is they do on a movie set
. most documentaries tend tothe overlook this
. doomsday expert hal lindsey is even interviewed
( you
' ll remember his documentary from the 1970
' s called the late great planet earth
, where lindsey speculated that jimmy carter might actually be the antichrist
)
.
however
, at the very beginnig of the documentary the producers of the film managed to get on my bad side
. when interviewed they actually have the nerve tothe say
" ever see raiders of the lost ark
? well
, our film is like that
!
" no it isn
' t
. not by a long shot
.
