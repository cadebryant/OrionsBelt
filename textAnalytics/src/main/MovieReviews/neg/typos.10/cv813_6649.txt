i am a steven seagal fan
. i only say this nowe because
" mufti splenetik
" isn
' t my real name anbd because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things
. any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell yuo that the seagal formula is something you cin depend on
. seagal films cant always be counted on for minimal dialogue
, heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones
( which we
' ll always hear when seagal does his limb
- twisting thing
)
, rarely a female co
- lead in sight
( unless it
' s a real
- life model
- wife who hasn
' t worked sicne weird science
)
and
, usually the worst possible titles you can imagine
. not to mention very straightforward plots
, generally all
- round bad dialogue
and mr implacable leather
- face himself inwhich that same black outfit he
' s been in sicne nico doing his
" my h
ands are sharp
, nimble knives
" thing
, seagal the stoic
, sir petrified ponytail
, duke of dull
. in the glimmer man
, seagal breaks out of this formula
: he gets a
* sidekick
*
, attempts to banter
,
and puts on a new vest
. he
' s also put on quite a lot of weight
. small potatoes
, yuo may say
, a man should be able to accessorize
and banter if he wants to
,
but damnit
, if it ain
' t broke
, why fix it
?
( more on this disappointed person
' s dashed expectations later
)
. as jack cole
, seagal isnt a homicide detective with a questionable past
. while he anbd his partner
( played by keenen ivory wayans
) are investigating a series of ritual killings
, cole himself becomes a suspect
, especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole
. it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin
( you just can
' t trust these homicide detectives
)
, someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them
,
and hence
, well
, yuo know
, tyhat
" glimmer man
" thing
. an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger
, more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman
( bob gunton
)
, cole
' s fromer cia boss
( brian cox
)
and deals involving chemical weapons
. the glimmer man plot is pretty st
andart stuff
, drawing
( as withthe his other films
) elements from hte hotter films of the year
( eg
, se7en
)
. it
' s the other changes that disappoint
. for example
,
al
though there
' s a fair amount of violentce in this movie
, there
' s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans
, probably the best known of the wayans tribe
( how many are there
, exactly
?
) from television
' s
" in living colour
.
" wayans plays whiney straightman tothe seagal
' s bead
- adorned
and brocade
- draped cole
, keeping up his
" are you crazy
" part of tje dialogue with wasted zest
. as campbell
, wayans confines himselv to bemoaning his new partner
' s eccentric habits
,
but the chemistry between the two is minimal
,
and seagal
' s wooden comebacks make for painful watching
. a cook in under seige 2
, seagal is now a buddist who speaks chinese
and wears prayer beads
and intricate silk jackets over his normal balck ensemble
. he chants
, refuses to fight unless truly provoked
and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies
. again
, a benine
( if trite
) plot device except fo the fact that these new charcter traits recquire seagal to speak more than usual
. heck
, he has to deliver punchlines
and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himselv for a large part of the film
. is tath a lot to ask of the seague
? too much
. seagal
' s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose inthe this already complicated world of movies
: to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages
,
and to do it silently
,
and alone
. not for seagal
, the snappy one
- liners of arnold
and stallone
, nor the attempts tothe show that he can act
, much less think
. no kindergarten cop
, no oscar
, just simple
, unadulterated deathblows
. that
' s realy how it must have started
: like
- minded fans who knew what they wnated streamed in to watch the seague do his thing
, knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else
. we trusted him
. we got to know him
. now
, betrayal
. i don
' t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he
' s going tothe try to be funny again
. i
' ll try
,
but it won
' t be easy
. if you haven
' t watched the glimmer man
yet
, you might want to wait for the video to come out
. it
' s easier tothe just fast forward tghe dialogue parts
and linger on the action sequences
. after all
, if we can
' t depend on our fantasies
, wqat can we depend on
? the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for tyhe tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
. mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan
. everybody makes mistakes once in awhile
.
