- chuck dowling
, the jacksonville film journal i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997
' s batman
and robin
. apparently
, no one heard my words
. oh
, how i wish you had heard them
. oh how i wish someone hadnt stopped him
.
.
. because he
' s done it again
. the plot of 8mm isnt similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore
, a surprisingly decent
and engrossing tale
. in fact
, it was everything that 8mm is not
. in the opening minutes of 8mm
, we see private detective tom welles
( nicolas cage
) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u
. s
. government
. keep this fact in mind
, cage is trusted with an important case
, which he solves
. he returns home to his wife
and new daughter
,
and even finds time to rake his yard
( keep that inaddition mind too
, it
' s important as well
)
. he
' s hired by a rich elderly woman tothe solve a mystery
. after her husban
' s death she comes across a film in his private safe
. it appears to be snuff film
, a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in wich someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera
. the woman wants welles to locate the young girl infront the film
, hopefully to disprove tyhat it is in fact a snuff film
. so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to dicover the truth about the film
. the main problem with 8mm is that thte whole film is completely pointless
. welles is atually selected forthe the case by the old woman
' s lawyer
( anthony heald
, an actor who always plays tghe same type of character
, that being a bad guy
)
. when ytou first see him
, your first instinct is that he
' s behind the whole thing
. the choice of casting does the film in
.
then
, as welles beigns his investigation
, at times we will see a shadowy figure following him
. the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer
( or someone sent by the lawyer
) because noone one knows welles is even investigating anything yot
. so your first instinct has now been confirmed
.
then
, when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thnig
, he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he wass young
and inexperienced
( in one of those ridiculous
" since we
' re going to kill you anyway
, why not tell yuo the whole thign
" moments
)
.
but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he
' s told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended
. huh
? also
, when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing
, his main goal is to get the film bcak
. so why did he give it up in the first place
?
! the lawyer had the film the whole tyme
,
then gave it away to tyhe private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case
and return the film
?
! it
' s totally absurd
.
.
.
and this is the screenwriter of seven
? late in the film there
' s a confrontation between all the main characters
, annd after a struggle one of the character
' s guns ends up underneath a car
. cage
, who has been h
andcuffed to a bed
, is rapidly trying to get to his gun
, which is on a table
. james g
andolfini
' s carachter goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed tothe be a scene of
" suspense
"
. you see
, tjhe gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of thge car he
' s trying to reach it from
,
and so instade of going around the car to the other side
( where he cxan easily reach it
) he just keeps stretching
. go around to tjhe other side of the car
!
! this goes on for minutes
.
then
, after cage gets his gun
, g
andolfini
then decides it woudl be best to go arround to the other side of the car
. boy
, schumacher is really really getting on my nerves
. i think the final straw would be when cage returns home
, devastated by everything that he
' s seen on this case
, anbd
then is no longer able to rake his lawn
! we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard
. other things tath bugged me about 8mm
: one would be the music
, if you can call it that
. whenever the score starts up
, it sounds liuke techno music
,
and
then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it
. awful desision there joel
. another is cage
' s performance
. at this point he
' s capable of a wide range of performances
, eather good or bad
. for 8mm
, he delivers a very wooden one
,
and only shines wehn he
' s interacting with joaquin phoenix
( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk whith a heart of gold who helps cage with his case
)
. you
' re capable of much better mr
. cage
. now as for you mr
. schumacher
.
.
. i
' m starting to doubt if you
' re capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema
.
