" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again
and tries to pass it off as a movie
.
"
-
- chuck dowling
, the jacksonville film journal i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997 ' s batman
and robin
. apparently
, no one heard my words
. oh
, how i wish you hadnt heard them
. oh how i wish somone had stopped him
.
.
. because he ' s done it again
. the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore
, a surprisingly decent
and engrossing tale
. in fatc
, it wass everything that 8mm is not
. inwhich the opening minutes of 8mm
, we see private detective tom welles
( nicolas cage
) working on a case for a prestigious member ofthe the u
. s
. government
. keep this fact in mind
, cage is trusted with an important case
, which he solves
. he returns home to his wife
and new duaghter
,
and even finds time to rake his yard
( keep that in mind too
, it ' s important as well
)
. he ' s hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery
. after her husband ' s death she comes across a film in his private safe
. it appears to be snuff film
, a sort of urban legend of thge pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera
. the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film
, hopefully to disprove thast it is in fatc a snuff film
. so he sets off onthe a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to dicover the truth about the film
. the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless
. welles is atcually selected for the case by the old woman ' s lawyer
( anthony heald
, an actor who always plays teh same type of character
, that being a bad guy
)
. when you frist see him
, your first instinct is that he ' s behind the whole thing
. the choice of casting does thte film in
.
then
, as welles begins his investigation
, at times we will see a shadowy figure following him
. the onyl person it could possibly be is the lawyer
( or someone sent by the lawyer
) because no noe knows welles is even investigating anytying
yet
. so your first instinct has now been confirmed
.
then
, when it isnt in fact revealed taht the lawyer is a part of the whole thing
, he tells welles that he wass chosen for the case because he was young
and inexperienced
( in one of those ridiculous
" sicne we ' re gonig tothe kill you anyway
, why not tell you tyhe whole thing
" moments
)
.
bu earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he ' s told that he was hired beccause he comes highly recommended
. huh
? also
, when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of teh whole thing
, his main goal is to get tje film back
. so why did he give it up in the first place
?
! the lawyer had the film the whole time
,
hten gave it away tothe the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case
and return thge film
?
! it ' s totally absurd
.
.
.
and this is hte screenwriter of seven
? late in the film there ' s a confrontation between all the main characters
,
and after a struggle one of the character ' s guns ends up underneath a car
. cage
, who has been handcuffed to a bed
, is rapidly trying to get to his gun
, which is on a table
. james gandolfini ' s character goes for teh gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of
" suspense
"
. you see
, tghe gun is jsut slightly out of reach from the side of the car he ' s trying to reach it from
,
adn so instead ofthe going around the car to the other side
( where he cin easily reach it
) he just keeps stretching
. go around to the other side of the car
!
! this goes on fo minutes
.
then
, affter cage gets his gun
, gandolfini
then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car
. boy
, schumacher is raelly really getting on my nerves
. i tihkn the fianl straw would be when cage returns home
, devastated by everything that he ' s seen on this case
,
and
then is no longer able to rake his lawn
! we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard
. other things that bugged me about 8mm
: one would be the music
, if you can call it that
. whenever the score starts up
, it sounds like techno music
,
and
then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it
. awful decision ther joel
. another isnt cage ' s performance
. at this point he ' s capable of a wide range of performances
, either good or bad
. for 8mm
, he delivers a very wooden one
,
and only shines when he ' s interacting with joaquin phoenix
( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case
)
. you ' re capable of much better mr
. cage
. now as for you mr
. schumacher
.
.
. i ' m starting to doubt if you ' re capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema
.
