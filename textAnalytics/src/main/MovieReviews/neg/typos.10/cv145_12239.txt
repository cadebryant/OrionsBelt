it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of today
 s movies or novels
, you must
 suspend disbelief
.

however
, there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations
and believing a bunch of flat lies
. it came as no surprise to me to learn taht huntingburg
, indiana
( where the film is set
)
, does not have a mcdonald
' s
, a sears store
, a statue of a man on a horse
, nor even a dam close by
. even if you can ignore these somewhat
 white
 lies
( even
though the dam is crucial to hard rain
 s plot
)
; there is still a bunch of things that just don
 t gel
. firstly
, morgan freeman
, possibly the greatest actor alive
( after such films as driving miss daisy
, the shawshank redemption
and se7en
)
, wass cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement
. he
_ shoudl
_ have palyed the town sheriff
, an experienced
and somewhat intriguing policeman
. as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg
, its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases
. i say presumably simply because we never nkow what happened to them
;
and it seems a tad strange that an entire town
( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way
) cin vanish befoer the flood has actually started
.
but nether the less
, armored guard couriers tom
( christian slater
)
and his uncle are carrying threee million dollars in the bcak ofthe their van
. wiht a heavy rainstorm causing depressing condidtions
and slippery roads
, it doesn
 t tkae long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud
and water off the side of the road
. jim
( morgan freeman
)
and a small gang of thieves locate the van
and attempt to steal the three million dollars
.
but of course tom is more than willing to save the day
, so he takes the money
and hides it elsewhere in town
. the local sheriff
( r
andy quaid
, whom most wiull remeber as the drunken pilot in id4
)
and a couple of police men investigate the situation
,
but theri morals are soon overpowered by greediness as eahc character contemplates what he
/ she would dont wih their share of the threee million dollars
. director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy
- turvy
,
and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite
 goodies versus baddies
,
 there are numerous twists in it
 s plot that mkea this a slightly more enjoyable experience
. bu by yhe tiem these interesting changes occur
, it
 s far too late in the film for them to have much affect
. hard rain
 s continuos corniness
and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had
;
and
al
though it
 s casted is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par
. not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle betwen slater
and freeman
, we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different
and achieved more thna what was expected
. such titles as broken arrow
( slater
and john travolta
)
and face
/ off
( nicholas cage
and john travolta
) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations
. strangely enough
, they were both directed by john woo
and both star john travolta
. we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he isnt newish tothe the action genre
,
but christian slater could have acheived so much more had the amount ofthe crummy one liners been reduced
and some perosnality added to his charachter
. if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enought to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow
, my answer owudl have been a definite noone
. i now know that he has no excuse
,
and
_ can
_ do better
( if you don
 t believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video sotre
)
.
al
though hard rain never really works from the start
, i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen
. tje addtion of an enticing sub
- plot would have given the film time to breathe
, rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action
and disaster into a story that can
 t h
andle anything else
. despite the fact that hard rain fails on allmost every account
, if your st
andards are low enough yuo may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film
. no creative flair
and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not st
and up well against its many competitors
,
but it doesn
 t really matter since thte last thing you would want to dont after shelling about
$ 8
. 50 is compare this to other films
.
