okay
, okay
. maybe i wasn
' t inthe the mood to watch a mindless action movei
; i am the same person that liekd lethal weapon iii
, even while admitting that it wasn
' t as ogod as the others
. howewer
, the latest segal picture didn
' t look that bad
,
and since none of my friends would go see a woody allen movie even if i paid them
, i went to see it expecting a mild die hard rehash
. boy
, was i wrong
! in the frist half of thte movie
, we are already assualted with segal
' s acting
,
( he isnt not simply wooden
; he is like a wall
)
, gratuitous violence
, an incredible plot
, sexist
and even more gratuitous nudity
,
and bad lines that obviously were meant as jokes
. by the end
, it is obvious that hundreds of navy men are no match for thirty armed special forces soldiers
. not once in tjhe movie did segal appear worried or undecided
, which did not do much fo increasing thte unexistent suspense
. of course
, in movies like these
, there must be a sidekick
,
and a lvoe interest
. in these one we are given a two for one package in the form of a playboy model
( in the movie
)
, which only functions as a supposed comic relief
( by the way of extremly stupid unfunny lines
)
,
and to have watering eyes
and look away every time something bad happens in the movie
. oh
, of course
, she appears naked from the waist up
,
and
, of course
, segal kisses her at the end after noone development of their relatiopnship
; they did not even seem tothe be interested in each other
. i have never seen so little chemestry between two people in a movei
. often
, tje villain saves the movie
; unfortunately
, the villains here are cartoonish
, stupid adn unfunny
, unmenacing
. how many movies hve psycho ex
- special forces bad guys
? too many
. i was able to predict the action all throughout the movie
, including the moment where the sidekick saves the hero from certain death
, the scene where hte bad guy can kill the hero
but proceeds to explain his plan tothe him
, the scene where we are shown the hero
' s superiors are stupid
, the scene where the bad guy loses his gun
and has to fight the hero h
and to h
and
, etc
.
.
. simply said
, this is movie
- making by the numbers
, boring
,
and potentially offensive in going for tjhe lowest common denominator ofthe the audience
. my recommendation
: if you go see it
, bring a watch
. you
' ll be looking at it forthe most of the movie
. my
. rent die hard
. read a book
. stare at tyhe sky
. do not waste your tyme on tihs worthless piece ofthe celluloid
. the real sad thing is that there are a lot of movies out that i would rather have seen
; once again
, dragged in by my friends
, hwihc by the way
, liekd the movie halfheartedly
. they probably like wrestling too
