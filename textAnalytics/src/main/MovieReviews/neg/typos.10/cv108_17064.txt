" practial magic
,
" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented
and high
- profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap
- trap like this oen
. the film stars s
andra bullock
and nicole kidman as sally
and gillian owens
, two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches
, spanning bcak 200 years
. at the start
, their parents die when they are still children
,
and they go to live with their twpo zany aunts
( stockard channing annd dianne wiest
)
. switch to tyhe present day
, gillian
, who is the stronger
, omre rebellious sibling
, leaves home
, anbd meets up withthe a dark
, abusive guy
( goran visjnic
)
, while sally stays iin their hometown
, meets
and falls in love with a sweet
, carring man
, has two children
,
and
then is devastated when her husb
and is hit by a truck
and killed
( come to think of it
, she
' s not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes
)
. when gillian calls sally to come git her after having anyother abusive spat with visjnic
, they accidentally murder him
,
and in desperation
, bury the body in the backyard of their aunts
' hous
. add to thsi wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising adn an exorcism
, not tothe mention a spattering of
" light
- hearted whimsy
,
"
and you have a pretty good diea how messy
" practical magic
" isnt
. after seeing the film
, i reflected that there was not even oney scene
, or element
, that i liked or enjoyed
. it is a comedy
, to be sure
,
but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat
,
and the ocassional dramatic moments are the least bit touching
. it is not charming or entertaining in any way
. annd
then to top it off
, we
' ve got this dark
, bu bird
- brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian
' s body
. whatever
. the characters are h
andled terribly
,
and actually
, most of the actors do not have teh fortune of even getting to be what you coudl call a character
. there is noone reason why channing
and wiest should ahev decided to be in this film
,
and in every scene involving them
, htey are always st
anding side
- by
- side
. no atempt is made to flesh them out into actual people
. the same goes for aidan quinn
, as a h
andsome police investigator
, who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock
, even
though he comes into it at around the 70
- minute mark
, adn once again
, there is no attempt to develop their relationship
, or his character
, in any way
. in fact
, every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along
, rather than getting to know the people saying the lines
. i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits
, when i found outloud the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman
, who managed to destroy the
" batman
" series wiht
" batman forever
"
and
" batman
and robin
.
"
" practical magic
" is directed by griffin dunne
, primarily an actor
, who last year made the contrived
, clumsy romance
,
" addicted to love
,
" with meg ryan
and matthew broderick
. i disliked that movie quite a bit
,
but since
" practical magic
" is even worse
, thta cxan only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is
. i
' d tell him to quit while he
' s ahead
,
but in these last twpo years
, he
' s ultimately already buried himself
.
