i think maybe it
' s time for the batman series to be put to rest
. not only has the first two films
' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a
" superhero
" been ab
andoned
,
but this one throws any lingering realism out the window
and goes for all
- out camp with few traces of the self
- mocking restraint of the relatively light
- hearted third installment
. let me give you an example
: in the first scene of the movie
, batman
( george clooney
) adn robin
( chris o
' donnell
) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
) in an attempt to steal a diamond
. mr
. freeze
' s thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks
,
but thsi is noone problem for our hreoes
: automatic skates shoot out of their shoes
, at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick
, grabs the diamond
,
and stick
- h
andles it thru teh museum
. i might have expected this from an airplane
- style farce
,
but i don
' t think that
' s what this movie is supposed tothe be
. after all
, the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the st
andards of the superhero
/ action genre
and kept the corny death
- defying stunts to a minimum
, while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony
. not any more
; the list goes on
and on in thsi one
. robin holds onto the outside ofthe a flying rocket ship 30
, 000 feet high in the atmosphere
, climbing in the door tothe sive batman
. mr
. freeze
and poison ivy
( uma thurman
) leap from a skyscraper annd survive by l
anding in a small pond
. a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he
- man cartoons
. my veyr favorite example is the scene in which batgirl
( alicia silverstone
) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs
, during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline
and setting it on frie to distract her
. not bad
,
but wouldn
' t the police
( or maybe batman
?
) notice if the road was on fire
? i knew gotham city ws htis crazy anarchic place
,
but
.
.
.
. it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule thta there have to be more main characters
and plot lines in each successive installment
. as if three protagonists
and two villains weren
' t enough
, batman
and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne
' s
butler alfred
( michael gough
)
, which might have seemed poignant if it wasn
' t surrounded by so much silliness
, as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce
' s girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie
. all this might be semi
- excusable if teh story were interesting
and entertaining
,
but it isn
' t
. in fact
, it
' s kind of boring
. mr
. freeze
and poison ivy pale inthe comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson
' s joker
and danny devito
' s penguin
. their evil plot is as predictable
( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words
,
" today gotham city
, tomorrow the world
!
"
) as it is lame
- brained
( didn
' t it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too
?
)
.
and robin
' s constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull
- headed
and stupid
and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner infact tje first place
. strip away the stars
, the fancy set design
,
and the status as a
" batman movie
,
"
and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick
.
