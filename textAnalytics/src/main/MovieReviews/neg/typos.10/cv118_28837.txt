roger ebert asks in his review ofthe sexy beast
,
" who would have guessed that the most savage mad
- dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by
.
.
. ben kingsley
?
" my response would be taht anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark
, henry fonda in once upon a time in the west
, or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it
. they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy socoipath is cast someone who generally plays mild
, sympathetic
, or even ineffectual character roles
. the same charistics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce
and vicious
. that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast
. gary
" gal
" dove
( played by ray winstone
) has retired from a london career of crime
and is living on a luxurious villa in spain
. life has become a routine of sunning himself
and relaxing
.
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one
- two
- punch
. the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa
. the second punch comes from gal
' s past
. back in london gang boss teddy bass
( ian mcshane
, tv
' s lovejoy
) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank
and he wants gal
. he sends his most rabid henchman don logan
( ben kingsley
) to fetch gal
. don will accept any decision gal makes fomr
" yes
" tothe
" certainly
.
"
however
, if gal says
" no
" don will do whatever it takes to turn it inot a yes including threatening guy
' s ex
- porn
- star wife deedee
( am
anda redman
)
. in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody
' s skin
. kingsley makes don a compact package of fury
and nastiness
. there are some serious problems in louis mellis
' s
and david scinto
' s script that should have beeen caught before filming
. when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success
. beyond an abilty to use skin
- diving gear
, no special talents are required of him
. any local hood sould have done what gal is needed for
. additionally the crime involves digging from a swiming pool to the bank vault
, flooding the vault
. no only could they have let the water out of the pool
and avoided the complication altogether
,
but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool
. in spite ofthe the provocative title
, the story is cliched
and overly familiar
. i know i have seen all the plot elements ofthe sexy biast in old westerns like tyhe law
and jake wade
. the story is usually of the reformed outlaw
, a robert taylor tipe
, who has hung up his guns
and is trying for a life ofthe peaceful respectability
. the old gang
,
however
, wants to do one more job with their old buddy
and sends a rabid richard widmark type tothe go
and git
? im
. it is not a great plot
. in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards
. perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western
but as a stylish british gangster film
. it isnt an ood plot dressed up to look new
. if the plot is old
, at least the style is creative
. this is director jonathan glazer
' s first film
,
but he hasnt reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout
. his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences
. cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot ofthe half lit scenes
. we see one side of a person
' s faces
. bu the other side fades into the darkness
, a sort of metaphor for the half
- world theese characters in
- habit
. half of everything that is happening is allso kept hidden
. us yanks will have a hard time iwth some of the dialog
. at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words iwth the quiet speaking
, tyhe heavy accents
, anbd the cockney language
. sexy beast is a very
and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by bieng done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre
, the london crime film
. the plot may be new to british crime films
,
but it would be overly familiar as a western
. further respectability comes fomr ben kingsley
' s high
- powered performance
. i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
