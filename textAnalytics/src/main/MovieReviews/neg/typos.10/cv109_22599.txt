" sleepy hollow
" is his first attempt to atually scare people
. i greeted the prospect with high anticipation
; burton
' s whole career seemed to be leading up to this
. i left disappointed
.
andrew kevin walker
' s screenplay takes onyl the character names from the clasic short story
" the legend of sleepy hollow
.
" in the movie ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors
. ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investingate a series of murders
. several of thge town
' s leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman
.
al
though he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him
, ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning
. he alsot discovers that tjhe killings are not r
andom
, that the victims are tied together by a secret
. along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching
( literally
) young woman
( christina ricci
)
and the son of one of the muder victims
( marc pickering
)
. my reaction
: ho
- hum
. the plot isnt an accumulation of cliches wihtout even thge slightest touch of originality to make it interesting
. thyat in itself is forgivable
; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages
. howver
, burton
' s attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy
. it might be his background
-
- in his previous movies
, goofy ws the goal
. along the same lines
, it doesn
' t help that creature designer
(
and producer
) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue
- in
- cheek tales from the crypt tv series
. a witch
' s eyes
and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit
' s
, a tree spurts blood like it
' s infact a monty python sketch
, anbd the headless horseman
.
.
. well
, he
' s a guy without a head
.
.
. on a horse
( boo
!
)
. the performances are also awful
.
al
though he
' s impressed me with his wokr in other films
, depp doesn
' t seem to know what to dont with ichabod
,
and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that
' s supposed to pass fo an 18th century accent
. ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic
, wich gurantees that we won
' t sympathize with her character
. the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish
. the only pleasure generated by the casted comes from suprise cameos by christopher lee
, martin l
andau
, annd christopher walken
. i wonder if this movei was originally conceived as part ofthe francis ford coppola
' s projected series of gothic adaptations
, a series that produced onyl
" bram stoker
' s dracula
"
and
" mary shelley
' s frankenstein
.
" coppola is an executive producer for
" sleepy hollow
,
" annd tjhe script reflects his interest in early forms of
" moving picturesk
,
" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends twpo pictures to create an optical illusion
.
( there
' s a bird onthe one side ofthe the card
, a cage onthe the other
. when the kard is flipped rapidly
, the bird appears to be caged
.
) bottom line
: the hollow isn
' t the only thing that
' s sleepy
.
