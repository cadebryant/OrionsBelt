for a movie with such deep religious
and spiritual undertones
, it is surprising to find the messanger
: the story ofthe joan of arc such an ungodly mess
. in the early to mid 1400
' s
, htere was little in the way of spiritual light to be foudn shining from the heart of a man or woman
. the church was a dismally dark
and oppressive place
. france was involved infront
" the hundred years war
" against engl
and
. there was no strong political leadership in the country
. morale was low
, there bieng little hope for the future
. it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing
" voices
"
and seeing
" visions
.
" convinced that these were messages from god
, she brazenly dem
anded to see tghe dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him
. the message
: if he would give her an army to comm
and
, she would deliver to him the crown
. he does
.
.
. anbd she does
. thne
, once seated on the throne
, he ab
andons her tothe her english captors
. director luc besson
( the fifth element
) may have co
- wrote the script
but he never appeared to have a proper h
andle on the material
. the inconsistencies of the cast
, the confusing blur ofthe the violent battle scenes
, the inappropriate musical score
,
and the lack ofthe a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable
. his biggest miscue was tothe cast his wife
, milla jovovich
( the fifth element
) in the title role
. ms
. jovovich
, looks spectacular as joan
, clad in battle armor
, astride a similarly protected horse
. if looks were enough to fully convey a character
, she would have been brilliant
. since it isn
' t
, she tried
(
and failed
) tothe act the part
. her joan is unbalanced
,
" inspiring
" the troops merely by screaming stridently annd waving her banner or sword over her head liek a woman possessed
. john malkovich
( being john malkovich
) fares a bit better as the dauphin
, who joan woudl see on the throne as charles vii
. an easily manipulated man
, his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death
. faye dunaway
( the thomas crown affair
) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin
' s mother
- in
- law anbd chief advisor
. the army under joan
' s comm
and are comprised of comical figures
, more stooges than soldiers
. the one exception would be tcheky karyo
( la femme nikita
) as dunois
, the man who was leading the attack prior to joan
' s arrival
. trying to plan a systematic campaign
, he sees his leadership authority negated by joan
' s insistence on following her
" visions
.
" dustin hoffman
( sphere
) has a small inhuman role as joan
' s conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial
. dressed liek cloaked monk
, he leads her to doubt herself
and her
" revelations
.
" as well she should
. scriptures do speak of revelation
. god
, via his gift of holy spirit
, is able to communicate to men
. three of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation
. tehy are
: word of knowlege
, word ofthe wisdom
,
and discerning of spirits
. even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his
" wholy men
.
.
. who spake as they were moved by holy spirit
( i
. e
. by revelation
.
)
"
but the scriptures also caution us
:
" beloved
, believe not every spirit
,
but try the spirits whether they are of god
: because many false prophets are gone out into the world
.
" 1 john 4

] joan
' s end
,
( being burned at the stake at the age ofthe 19
)
, the frenzy
( mob rule
)
and blood lust her inspiration wrought
,
and the death
, pain
, or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one
. while her conviction
and intense beleiving remains an admirable quality
, she was
, as others have been before anbd since
, misled by the spiritual master of deception
. as a messenger
, she was quite effective
. she was jstu confused as to whose message she was carrying
.
