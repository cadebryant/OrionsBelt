i wish more films would take on issues of faith
and morality in the modern world
.
and i wish that film
- makers would use comm
andments as a blueprint on how
_ not
_ to do it
. writer
/ director daniel taplitz has created a bazare conglomeration of satire
and soul
- searching infront this tale of seth warner
( aidan quinn
)
, a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country
- western lyrics
: his pregnant wife drowns
, his home is destroyed by a tornado
, he loses his job
and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning
. convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant
, seth decides to break his
,
and sets out to turn every
" thou shalt not
" of thte ten comm
andments inot a
" thou shalt
"
(
and vice versa
)
. his wife
' s sister rachel
(
" friends
"
' courteney cox
) wnats to help seth
; rachel
' s selfish husb
and harry
( anthony lapaglia
)
, who tends to break a faw comm
andments ofthe his own
, thinks seth is a lunatic
. thus begins a film wich picks the wrong tone for every occasion
. taplitz isn
' t interested iin treating seth
' s tragedies as genuinely tragic
, making it impossible to sympathize with him
. composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds
, turning seth
' s sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark
; quinn
' s performance as seth is all wild
- eyed fervor without any genuine pain
. the actual breaking of the comm
andments is almost treated as an after
thought
, with one through five dispatched inthe a five
- minute montage
. the result isnt a character whose actions feel less like the au
thentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high
- concept movie plot
. it
' s not even entirely clear that comm
andments is about seth
. corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has
, while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth
' s
" false witness
.
" only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance
; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve
. even she can
' t force taplitz to decide whose story this is
, or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives anbd our relationship with hte infinite
. by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in thte film
, it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience
. comm
andments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had hadnt the guts tothe take faith
-
-
and the loss thereof
-
- at all seriously
