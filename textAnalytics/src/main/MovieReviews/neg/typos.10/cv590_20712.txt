if you ' re debating whther or not to see
_ breakfast
_ of
_ champions
_
, ask yourself one simple question
: do you want to see nick nolte in langerie
? the onyl people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph ' s chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross
- section ofthe teh ppoulation with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight
. everyone else
-
-
adn i ' m hoping that ' s most people
-
- would be wise to steer clera of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess
. actually
,
though
, the sight of nolte in high heels is one ofthe the more amusing things about thsi muddle
, which focuses dwayne hoover
( bruce willis
)
, hte owner of dwayne hoover ' s exit 11 motor village in midland city
. not only is he a huge success as a businessman
, he ' s also something of a celebrity
, his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials
. with a nice home
and family to boot
, dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy
-
-
yet he ' s not
. his wife celia
( barbara hershey
) is perpetually in a pill
- induced haze
; his son george
( lukas haas
) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name
" bunny
.
" not only that
, the environmental protection agency is on dwayne ' s ass over a building development project
. it ' s enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown
-
- that is
, if he doesn ' t succeed inthe blowing his brains out first
. meanwhile
, midland city is about to host a fine arts festival
,
and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout
( albert finney
)
, a writer who is far from tjhe renowned author the festival ' s organizer
( buck henry
) ws led to believe
-
- in fact
, he ' s a penniless hack who writes second
- rate sci
- fi that appears iin porn magazines
. his trak to midland city is also a spiritual journey
, one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne
, who forthe soem reason thikns thyat trout will hold for him all of life ' s answers
. the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews
,
but
, ironically
, i have barely scratched the surface
. i haven ' t
yet mentioned wayne hoobler
( omar epps
)
, an ex
- con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly
- named dwayne
.
then there ' s the matter of francine
( glenne headly
)
, dwayne ' s devoted secretary
. nto to mention dwayne ' s employee
and old friend harry lesabre
( nolte
)
, the one with the secret penchant for cross
- dressing
.
and so on
. the film is essentially dwayne ' s story
,
but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders waht the point isnt
. rudolph does arrive at a point
( more on that later
)
,
but it ' s blunted
and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material
. the surveill visual style
, complet with printed words flying through the air
and into dwayne ' s ears
, is obviously meant tothe convey a sense of madness
,
but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad
. the actors are called on to act accordingly
, resulting in some of the worst
, most overdone work all of them have ever turned in
. willis fares best of all
-
-
but that ' s because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience
. with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time
, it comes as a shock when thigns suddenly turn serious
,
and rudolph tries to mkae a statement
. unlike
_ american
_ beauty
_
( a film that
_ breakfast
_ resembles in more than a faw ways
, tothe its great detriment
)
, there isn ' t any palpably earnest undercurrent that owudl prepare the audience for the big shift
. as such
, the cartoony charachters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned
;
and the film attempts
, to no avail
, to reach a profundity that it doesn ' t deserve
. vonnegut ' s original novel is considered a classic
,
but it had been called unfilmable
-
- the same that was said of hunter s
. thompson ' s
_ fear
_
and
_ loathing
_ in
_ las
_ vegas
_
, which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam
. with thte similar failure of
_ breakfast
_ of
_ champions
_
, will hollywood ever leran that books labeled
" unfilmable
" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable
? likely not
.
