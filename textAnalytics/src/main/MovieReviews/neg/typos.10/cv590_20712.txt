if you
' re debating whether or not to see
_ breakfast
_ of
_ champions
_
, ask yourself one simple question
: do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie
? the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph
' s chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross
- section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see thta unpleasant sight
. everyone else
-
-
and i
' m hoping that
' s most people
-
- would be wise tothe steer clear ofthe this excrutiatingly unfunny mess
. actually
,
though
, yhe sight ofthe nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle
, which focuses dwayne hoover
( bruce willis
)
, the owner of dwayne hoover
' s exit 11 motor village in midl
and city
. not only is he a huge success as a businessman
, he
' s also something of a celebrity
, his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials
. with a nice home
and family to boot
, dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients tothe be happy
-
-
yet he
' s not
. his wife celia
( barbara hershey
) is perpetually in a pill
- induced haze
; his son george
( lukas haas
) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name
" bunny
.
" not only that
, the environmental protection agency is on dwayne
' s ass over a building development project
. it
' s enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown
-
- that is
, if he doesn
' t succeed in blowing his brains out first
. meanwhile
, midl
and city is about tothe host a fine arts festival
,
and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout
( albert finney
)
, a writer who is far from tghe renowned autor the festival
' s organizer
( buck henry
) was led to believe
-
- in fact
, he
' s a penniless hack who writes second
- rate sci
- fi that appears in porn magazines
. his trek tothe midl
and city is also a spiritual journey
, one thgat reaches its apex after meeting dwayne
, who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life
' s answers
. yhe above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give iin my reviews
,
but
, ironically
, i have barely scratched the surface
. i haven
' t
yet mentioned wayne hoobler
( omar epps
)
, an ex
- con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly
- named dwayne
.
then there
' s the marter of francine
( glenne headly
)
, dwayne
' s devoted secratary
. not to mention dwayne
' s employee
and old friend harry lesabre
( nolte
)
, the one with the secret penchant for cross
- dressing
.
and so on
. the film is essentially dwayne
' s story
,
but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what tghe point is
. rudolph does arrive at a point
( more on that later
)
,
but it
' s blunted
and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material
. the surreal visual style
, complete with printed words flying thru hte air
and into dwayne
' s ears
, is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness
,
but its bludgeoning nature isnt likely to make viewers mad
. the actors are called on to act accordingly
, resulting in soem ofthe the worst
, most overdone work all of them have ever turned inspite
. willis fares best of all
-
-
but that
' s because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience
. withthe such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time
, it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious
,
and rudolph tries to make a statement
. unlike
_ american
_ beauty
_
( a film that
_ breakfast
_ resembles in mroe than a few ways
, to its graet detriment
)
, there isn
' t any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift
. as such
, the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned
;
and the film attempts
, to no avail
, to triarch a profundity that it doesn
' t deserve
. vonnegut
' s original novel is considered a classic
,
but it had been called unfilmable
-
- the same that was said ofthe hunter s
. thompson
' s
_ fear
_
and
_ loathing
_ in
_ las
_ vegas
_
, which was disastrously committed to film last eyar by terry gilliam
. with the similar failure of
_ breakfast
_ ofthe
_ champions
_
, wiull hollywood ever learn that books labeled
" unfilmable
" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable
? likely not
.
