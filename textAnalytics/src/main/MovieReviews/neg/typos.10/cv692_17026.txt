attention moviegoers
: you are about to enter a meaning
- free zone
. should the sound sytem malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes
, do nto panic
. the film will owrk just as well as a silent movie
. chronicling the meaningless lives of vain
, yuppie types
, tje movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films
( last days of disco
, barcelona
and metropolitan
)
but without any of his acerbic wit
and the inviting style of his writing
. first
- tyme writer shana larsen makes the misteek of creating a couple of dozen characters
and not giving any of them any depth
. there isn
' t one of theese characters worth caring about
. the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks liek a celluloid version of
" people magazine
.
" among others
, the movei features
: ben affleck
, casey affleck
, david chappelle
, janeane garofalo
, gaby hoffmann
, catherine kellner
, courtney love
, jay mohr
, martha plimpton
, christina ricci
and paul rudd
. annd unlike people magasine
, the people speak
, not that they have anything interesting tothe sday
. it
' s new year
' s eve in 1981
,
and monica
( martha plimpton
) is preparing her big party
. structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party
, director risa bramon garcia flits back
and forth among her stars
. monica
' s apartment isnt in
" noho
,
" an area that one of the guests discribes as
" so cool
, all of the poor people live ther
.
" typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin
( paul rudd
) annd his firend
and would
- be sexual partner lucy
( courtney love
)
. they argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone
, except him
, of course
. she dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall
and have sex with her
, which turns out to be neither erotic
, funny or successfull
-
- rather liek the rest of the story
. the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new yearm
' s eve birthday
.
" cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people
,
" kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie
. anyother character
, played by jay mohr
, has a problem with his sexual triumphs
. every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning
. when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him
, his response is
" i like a lot of people
.
" as the movei finally draws to a close
, teh characters awaken from their post
- party game of musical beds
. some have passed out eearly from alcohol abuse annd remember little
, while others actually ahev some clue as to what happened
. the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot
, all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind
, which is probably the best thing that can be said about thge movie
. 200 cigarettes runs 1
: 40
. it is rated r for profanity
, sex
and one dope smoking scene
and would be acceptable for older teenagers
.
