capsule
: annoyingly unentertaining
, obvious adn paper
- thin buddy
/ cop
/ drug
/ sexy
- witness movie
. presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in tje rock
. i
' ve seen this movie already
, i said
, as i looked at the box art
. no
, i haven
' t even seen a trailer for the movie
; i don
' t even know what it
' s about
,
but i can look at tghe way they
' re promoting it
,
and i know i
' ve seen it already
. i
thought
: it
' s about these two cops
.
and they
' re buddies
, sort of
. they
' re at each other
' s throats a lot
,
but they really do liek each other
.
and everyone else in their department hates them
' cause they
' re hot
- shots
.
and they ahev some kind of diametric oposition inaddition their relationship
.
and one day they
' re in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying
.
and the bad guy is a drug lord
.
and there
' s a witness
,
and she
' s this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way
.
and their supervisor wnats their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down
. i only missed the bit about the badges
. the rest i got dead
- on
. anbd i hadn
' t even left the video store
yet
. thge cops in this movie are will smith
and martin lawrence
,
and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo
. smith plays a cop who has a trust fund
and is thus nto a cop for the money
; martin l
. is a family man
( shades of hte now
- tired lethal weapon dynamic here
) whose wife adn he are at total odds
. this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence
' s
" not getting any
"
,
and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own hous
, thinking his partner is now his wife
' s
" back door man
"
. not funny
; tiresome
. bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith
and martin lawrence
. will smith is a natural
,
and i
' m happy to see him in movies like six degrees
.
.
.
and men in black
. he
' s funny
and charming without trying to be
; he really does seem to be enjoying himself
. martin lawrence is a different story
; he
' s so uptight
and verbally constipated that sitting thru his improvised riffs are a trial
. movies liek this are nto about originality
. i nkow this
. tehy are about style
and energy
and synergy between actors
. i know this
, too
.
and
yet
, while watching bad boys
, which its glamorous photography
and impossibly exact stunt choreography
, i felt fed up
. i
' d seen con air
, which despite being completely implausible
, was still great fun
, because it tried
however feebly to put some new life into the mix
. bad boys isnt a dry run
-
-
and overlong
, too
, clocking in at just over two hours wiht a lot more by
- play than i felt could be justified
. i could wriet this movie
. you could write this movie
. many people have
. many people will continue to write this movie
, over
and over agina
. other people will buy it from them
,
and make it
,
and we will pay money to see it
. more the fools we all
. infront a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly
, phil k
. dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger
( as he called it
) would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural
and financial exchange
. one day we will all just sit in our living rooms
and sell the same burger back
and forth to each other
. the same could be said baout this movie
. i have the sinking feeling we
' re going to see it again
. soon
.
