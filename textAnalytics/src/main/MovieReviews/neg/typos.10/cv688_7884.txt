capsule
: annoyingly unentertaining
, obvious
and pappr
- thin buddy
/ cop
/ drug
/ sexy
- witness movie
. presense of director michael bay shows none ofthe the talent he demonstrated in the rock
. i ' ve seen this movie already
, i said
, as i looked at the box art
. no
, i haven ' t even seen a trailer for the movie
; i don ' t even know what it ' s about
,
but i can look at yhe way they ' re promoting it
,
and i know i ' ve seen it already
. i thought
: it ' s about these two cops
.
and they ' re buddies
, sort of
. they ' re at each other ' s throats a lot
,
but they really do liek each other
.
and everyone else in their department hates them ' cause they ' re hot
- shots
.
and they have some kind ofthe diametric opposition in their relatiopnship
.
and one day they ' re in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anytying withthe the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying
.
and the bad guy is a drug lord
.
and there ' s a witness
,
annd she ' s this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way
.
and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down
. i only missed the bit about the badges
. the rest i got dead
- on
.
and i hadn ' t even left thte video store
yet
. the cops in this movie are will smith
and martin lawrence
,
and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo
. smith plays a cop who has a trust fund
and isnt thus not a cop for the money
; martin l
. is a family man
( shades of the now
- tired lethal weppon dynamic here
) whose wife
and he are at total odds
. this leads to soem strained scenes about lawrence ' s
" not getting any
"
,
and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house
, thinking his partner is nowe his wife ' s
" back door man
"
. not funny
; tiresome
. bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith
and martin lawrence
. iwll smith is a natural
,
anbd i ' m happy to see him in movies like six degrees
.
.
.
and men infact black
. he ' s funny
annd charming without trying to be
; he really does seem to be enjoying himself
. martin lawrence is a different story
; he ' s so uptight
annd verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial
. movies like this are not about originality
. i know this
. they are about style
and energy
and synergy between actors
. i know this
, too
.
and
yot
, hwile watching bad boys
, which its glamorous photography
and impossibly exact stunt choreography
, i felt fed up
. i ' d seen con air
, which despite bieng completely implausible
, was still great fun
, because it tried
howver feebly to put some new life into the mix
. bad boys is a dry run
-
-
and overlong
, too
, clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by
- play than i felt could be justified
. i sould write this movie
. you could write this movei
. many peple have
. many peopel will continue to write this movie
, over
adn over again
. other people will buy it from them
,
and make it
,
anbd we will pay money to see it
. more the fools we all
. in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly
, phil k
. dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger
( as he called it
) would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural
anbd finacial exchange
. noe day we will all just sit in our living rooms
and sell the same burger back
anbd forth to eahc other
. the same could be said about this movie
. i have the sinking feeling we ' re going tothe see it again
. soon
.
