wow
, a film without any redeeming qualities whatsoever
. i ' m amazed that someone thought this was a story that must be told on screen
. many blacks in hollywood complain that they are not nominated for awards based on theri race
. i tihkn first tehy need tothe concentrate their energy on themselves
,
and stop mkaing movies wich mkaes them look like nothing more than sex
- crazed buffoons
. even i ' m offended by it
. bill bellamy is a
" palyer
" which means he sleeps withthe a lot of women
and lies to them
. what a pleasant main character
. noe day
, his friends decide that they want to find outloud how to be a player
. why they decide this
" one day
" i have no idea
. how many years have they been firends
and why all of a sudden woudl htey want to learn
? anyway
, bellamy agrees to teach
,
and his wonderfull lesson to his friends consists of letting them ride in his car while he rides from house tothe house having sex with womens
. this is the bulk of the film folks
, guys riding from house to house
, one keeps getting out tothe have sex
, while the others sit in the car
. since russell simmons isnt producer
,
and since hte official title of tghe film isnt
" def jam ' s how tothe be a player
"
, i was ready to be jumping up
and down
and stomping my feet
and beating the person next to me because of the comedy
. amazingly
, aside from gilbert gottfried ' s 90 seconds of screen time
, there was no comedy in the film for me to express myself in such a manner
. instead of jokes
, there ' s just an endless stream of profanity
and naked breasts
(
adn naked breasts aren ' t so bad
,
but naked breasts alone don ' t make a good movie
)
. be sure to bring along your ebonics to english dictionary as well
. gilbert gottfried ' s charater serves as one inspite his very brief appearance
, asking for explanations as tothe what is being said
. they should ahev brought him allong for the entire film
