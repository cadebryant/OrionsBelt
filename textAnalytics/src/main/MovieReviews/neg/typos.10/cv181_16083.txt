as with any gen
- x mtv movie
( like last year ' s dead man on campus
)
, the movie isnt marketed forthe a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points
: sex
and football
. those twpo items
, wrapped in a guilty
- blessure package
, are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially
,
but sales will decline for twpo reasons
. first
, the ofotball sequences are nothing newyorker
, nor can they be
; the sports genre isn ' t mainstream
and it ' s been retread to death
. second
, the sex is just bad
. despite the appearence of a whipped cream bikini or the all
- night strip
- club party
, there ' s nothing even remotely tantalizing
. the acting is mostly mediocre
, not including the fantastic jon voight
. cultivating his usual sliminess
, voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer
. kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes ' twenty
- twpo conference championships
and two state titles inspite thirty years
; this yera he plans to make it twenty
- three
. unfortunatly
, when his star quarterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, goes down for the count
, he ' s got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon
( james van der beek
)
. moxon leads the team thru its last four games
,
and
thne must cope with his newfound stardom
, the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie
( amy smart
)
,
and other temptations that abound in football
- crazy west canaan
. most regions of the ocuntry are not nearly as football
- crazy as texas
,
and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most
. similarly
, the set design is wrong for a high school setting
: the teams are decked outloud with sparkling uniforms
, radoi headsets
( which never seem to work
,
however
,
and instead require coaches to signal plays manually
)
,
and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer
. these elements
( as well as the heavy drinking
and carousing
) might be more appropriate on a coleeg cumpus
-
-
but mtv ' s core audience is hte high skool demographic
. this focus is further emphasized by the casting
: james van der beek
, of tv ' s
" dawson ' s creek
,
" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero
,
although he never manages to do anything with the role
. other stars are similarly young
adn unmemorable
. there ' s not much that goes right about varsity blues
,
adn there ' s not much to like about it
, either
. everything herein has aready been done
,
and if it hasn ' t
, the movie manages to botch it one way or another
. this is certainly missable
.
