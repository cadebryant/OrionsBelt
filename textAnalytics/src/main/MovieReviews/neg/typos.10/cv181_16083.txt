as whith any gen
- x mtv movie
( like last eyar
' s dead man on campus
)
, the movie is marketed for a primarily male audiance as indicated by its main selling points
: sex
and football
. those two items
, wrapped in a guilty
- pleasure package
, are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially
,
but sales will decline for two reasons
. first
, the football sequences are nothing new
, nor can tehy be
; the sports genre isn
' t mainstream
and it
' s been retread to death
. second
, the sex is just bad
. despite the apprearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all
- night strip
- club party
, there
' s nothing even remotely tantalizing
. the acting is mostly mediocre
, not including the fantastic jon voight
. cultivating his usual sliminess
, voight gives an unexpectedly st
andout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer
. kilmer isnt the driving force behind the coyotes
' twenty
- two conference championships
and two state titles in thirty years
; this year he plans to make it twenty
- three
. unfortunately
, whn his star quarterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, goes down for the count
, he
' s got tothe rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon
( james van der beek
)
. moxon leads the team thru its last four games
,
and
then must cope with his newfound stardom
, the effect it hasnt on his relatiopnship with girlfriend julie
( amy smart
)
,
and other temptations thgat abound in football
- crazy west canaan
. most regions of the country are not nearly as football
- crazy as texas
, adn so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most
. similarly
, the set design is wrong for a high school setting
: the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms
, radio headsets
( which never seem to work
,
however
,
and instead require coaches to signal plays manually
)
,
and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer
. these elements
( as well as the heavy drinking
and carousing
) might be moreso appropropiate on a college campus
-
-
but mtv
' s core audience is teh high school demographic
. this focus is further emphasized by tyhe casting
: james van der beek
, of tv
' s
" dawson
' s creek
,
" is an underst
andable choice for the reluctant hero
,
al
though he never manages to dont anything with the role
. other stars are similarly young adn unmemorable
. there
' s not much that goes right about varisty blues
,
and there
' s not much to like about it
, either
. everything herein has already been done
,
and if it hasn
' t
, tje movie manages to botch it one way or another
. this is certainly missable
.
