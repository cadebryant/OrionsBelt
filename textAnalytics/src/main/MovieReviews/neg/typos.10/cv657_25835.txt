wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles
. murder at 1600
, u
. s
. marshals
, money train
, drop zone
, boiling point
,
and the ultimate camp film
- passenger 57
. the art ofthe war is another entry in htis very ugly
and unique category
. ultimatly
, it is little more than a ridiculous acation film with a plot as believable as the warren report
, ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe
,
and terrible acting by b
- list actors like michael biehn
and anne archer
. oddly
, it fiels like thte undiscovered sequel to another snipes
" masterpiece
,
" rising sun
. hte movie revolves arround the convenient stoyr of a special un operative caught up in a secre murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador
, the chinese triad brotherhood
, a rich chinese businessman
( played by
? that bad guy from rising sun
, cary
- hiroyuki tagawa
) a chinese un interpreter
,
and
, inexplicably
, donald sutherland
. the film ends with more confusion tahn a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to egister at ellis island
. or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix
and all ofthe john woo ' s hong kong films conbined
. i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes hadnt the gumption to not only star in this action dud
but also ect as one of the producers of the film
. i usually enjoy snipes ' movies
-
though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than tyhe flashiness of his action films
. simply
, i am amazed by the how inane the script was
, filled with terrable cliches
adn extremely violent action sequences
. director christian duguay
( screamers
) has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts
-
- showing splattering brains
, people impaled with broken shards of glass
,
and lots of gargling
and gagging as blood sprays everywhere
. it also sickens me tothe know that oliver stone
, one of the greatest directors working todya
, had his hand in producing this monstrosity
. i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle
and stone chose not tothe read the script
, watch tje dailies
, be involved in casting
, or anything else
-
- or else he ' d be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits
. it ' s also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies
and the middle eastern terrorist agnle being beaten to death in the last couple ofthe years that tghe newyorker international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese
. i ' m sure over the next couple of months
, even more
" chinese conspiracy
/ martial
- arts acation flicks
" are going to be popping up in your local multiplex
. hopefully they won ' t include wesley snipes
.
