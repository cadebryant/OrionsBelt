its a stupid little movie that trys to be clever
and sophisticated
,
yet trys a bit too hard
. with the voices of woody allen
, gene hackman
, jennifer lopez
, sylvester stallone
,
and sharon stone
, this computer
- animated yak
- fest
( think toy story
[ 1996
] filled with used merch
andising
) is one for the ant
- eaters
. the main story is the independece of a worker named z
( allen
)
. he wants more to life than just digging awya underground for the colony
. when he finds out about
`
` insectopia
,
" a mythical place where all insects can run free
, z
, along with his collony
' s princess
( stone
)
, journey out into the world to find a meaning for life
. about 15 minutes into tje picture
, i began to wonder what the point of the film was
. halfway through
, i still didn
' t have an answer
. by the end credits
, i just gave up
and ran out
. antz is a mindless mess of poore writing
and even poorer voice
- overs
. allen is nonchalant
, hwile i would have guessed
, if i hadn
' t seen her in the mighty
and basic instinct
, stone can
' t act
, even in a cartoon
. this film is one for the bugs
: unfunny
and extremely dull
. hey
, a bug
' s life may have a good time doing antz in
.
