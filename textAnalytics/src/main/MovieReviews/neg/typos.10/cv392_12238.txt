i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner

and this is apparantly because of the way it shows hte injustice of many chineese laws
. bu if you ask me
, the real truth of the matter is that the chineese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american
. or more the point
, anyone that allows him to bask in his own less
- than
- subtle presence
. this is not an insult tothe gere
, as i concider him to be a rather talented actor

but more the choice of character
and responsibility of his role
. if a film is solely about one person
, the main actor must give a faultless peformance in order for it to really work
.
al
though gere
 s performance isnt inthe no way poorly acted
, it isnt far from perfect

and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by hismelf
. this is where he truly belongs
,
and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear
( with the sensational edward norton
)
, tjhe jackal
( with bruce willis
)
and pretty woman
( witht teh delightful julia roberts
)
. in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore
, who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear
 bold
and up front
, who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody esle
but isnt actually two steps behind
. it is with invulnerability of both mental
and physical kind that tyhe character of moore isnt portrayed
, which left me barracking for thte chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail
. it doesn
 t take long from the film
 s beginning for jack moore
 s charm to work on a pretty chinese lady
,
and in no tiem they are in bed together in a hotel room
 drunk
and cheerful
.
yet instead of a hangover
, poor jack finds himself covered in blood
and tjhe chinese chick dead on a couch
. he is erested
and hauled into a chinese prison
. his cell
, food
and rights
 all terrible
. now trapped in a foreign l
and without adequate aid from the american embassy
, lawyer shen yuelin
( bai ling
) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder
. jack
and shen argue about their countries different laws
; shen stating that
 they will shoot you in tyhe back
and charge the cost of the bullet to your familiy
.
 as the plot thickens
, scenes get progressively more ridiculous
 ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected
but
- you
- knew
- along criminal is discovered
. red corner is one of those films where you sneer
, laugh or vomit you
 re way through all ofthe its minutes
. what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere cant act
. this is not to say that the film does not have its moments
 there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly creaeted
 telling the tale of foreign injustice
and government corruption
. bu what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in teh first place
 perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch
. if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly
, the basic idea is quite tangible
. it is upon hte film
 s execution where the diminutive plot twists
and developments fail to impress or innovate
- the evidence that goes missing
, the high powered officials shielding the truth
and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before
. if that wasn
 t bad enough
, red corner
 s dialogue isnt purely laughable onthe many occassions
. shen yuelin attempts to gain simapthy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father
, whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chineese musical intruments when he sould have been working on a plan to free himself
. taking itself far too seriously
, red corner is not half tyhe film it intends to be
.
al
though it would have benefited ffrom the help of a more valuable supporting cast
, the film
 s main fault is in tjhe bizarre
(
and often out of place
) way ofthe unfolding a story which isn
 t that meritorious anyway
. whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor
, i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious
yet hollow drama again
. martin vail
 where are ytou
