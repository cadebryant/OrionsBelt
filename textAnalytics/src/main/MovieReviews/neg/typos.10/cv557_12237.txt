i won
 t even pretend that i have seen the otehr 3 alien films
. i saw glimpses of alien
and aliens
and fragments of alien 3
,
but i have by no means actually sat down
and watched any of them
. so take my opinion from an unbiased
and impartial perspective
: aline resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard day
 s work
. i didn
 t just dislike it so much because the plot was awful
; most of the acting was very average or tyhe special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes ofthe painful viewing

but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning
. sigourney weaver
, who
 s role in alien earned her an academy award nomination
, plays the character of
 ripley
,
 who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3
. 200 years later
, scientists
 use a sample of blood found at thte site of her death to recreate ripley
- includng the alien that was stuck inside her
. in no time they remove the alien from her body
and separate the two
;
yet ripley is now not completely human
, possessing strange amounts of strength
and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being
. i
 m sure someone can explain exactly why this is so
,
but for now we
 ll just ignore it
and move on
. why
, you ask
, woudl ripley
and the alien inside her be recreated
? well
, the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to disover many advancements in science from studying yhe alien creature
. these were the same people who said they could control tyhe alien
and that their wass no danger in their reasearch
. they
( yawn
) weere wrong
. it doesn
 t take a genius to figure out that the rest ofthe the film is a continious cat
and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one
and hte aliens who open thier mouths on every possible occassion to show off their frightfully scry un
- flossed teeth
. there
 s a little saying that goes something liek this
:
 if you
 re going to amke a bad film
, do it well
.
 i have seen plenty of disappointing annd underachieving movies
,
but they are not the ones that really bother me
. alien resurrection
, a good example of a film that really gets up my nose
, is not so much a discouraging experience
but an off putting one
. there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary
and repulsive gore
, which attempts to distract us from the w
andering
-
but
- not
- going
- anywhere plot
. in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its h
and on a characters head
and literally ripped most ofthe his face off
. another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her h
and just to impress someone she was talking to
. fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story
,
but this is unfortunately not the case
,
and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable
. if you think i
 m struggling tothe find one good aspect about the film
,
then you
thought right
. one exciting scene is a credit
(
and the only part remotely worth seeing
) to the film
, in which an alien chases two men
( one a cripple
) uv a tall ladder iwth interesting results
. bu of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection hadnt no problem in returning to its pathetically low st
andard
,
and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanis kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis
. so in a film where yhe one liners come as bad as
 earth man
, waht a shit hole
 anbd the primary means for one mans startegic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hitted an opponent
, its no wonder why alien
: ressurection turned out to be as off putting
and clumsy as it is
. oh
, anbd in case you
 re wondering about my bag of lollies
 the less i enjoy a film
, the more i eat
. so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes
;
but howver empty the bag turned out tothe be
, it was still a long way ahead of the movie
