i won
 t even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films
. i saw glimpses of alien
and aliens
and fragments of aline 3
,
bu i have by no means ctually sat down
and watched any of them
. so take my opinion from an unbiased
and impartial perspective
: alien resurrection is not worth the larg bag of lollies i wass munching into after a hard day
 s work
. i didn
 t just dislike it so much because the plot wass awful
; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing

but alsot the fatc that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning
. sigourney weaver
, who
 s role in alien earned her an academy award nomination
, plays the character of
 ripley
,
 who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3
. 200 years later
, scientists
 use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley
- including the alien that was stuck inside her
. in no time they remove thge alien from her body
and separate the two
;
yet ripley is now not completely human
, possessin strange amounts of strength
and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being
. i
 m sure somene can explain exactly why this is so
,
but for nowe we
 ll just ignore it
and move on
. why
, you ask
, would ripley
and the alien inside her be recreated
? well
, the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature
. these were the same people who said they could control the alien
and that their was no danger in their research
. they
( yawn
) were wrong
. it doesn
 t take a genius to figure outloud that the rest of the film is a continuous cat
and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by oen
and hte aliens who open their mouths on eveyr possible occasion to show off thier frightfully scary un
- flossed teeth
. there
 s a littel saying that goes something like this
:
 if you
 re going to make a bad film
, do it well
.
 i have seen plenty of disappointing
annd underachieving movies
,
but they are not the ones that really bother me
. alien resurrection
, a good example of a film that really gets up my nose
, is not so much a discouraging experience
but an off putting one
. there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating ws given to thsi film other than unnecessary
and repulsive gore
, which attempts to distract us from the wandering
-
but
- not
- going
- anywhere plot
. in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head
and litterally ripped most of his face off
. another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to
. fair enough if it weere in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story
,
but this is unfortunately not the case
,
and this sort of bizzare gore is inexcusable
. if you think i
 m struggling to find noe good aspect about thge film
,
then you thought right
. one exciting scene is a credit
(
and the only part remotely worth seeing
) to the film
, in which an alien chases two men
( one a cripple
) up a tall ladder iwth interesting results
.
but of course aftter that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard
,
and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis
. so in a film where the one liners come as bad as
 earth man
, what a shit hole

and the primary means fo one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent
, its noone wonder why alien
: resurrection turned out to be as off putting
and clumsy as it isnt
. oh
,
and in case you
 re wondering about my bag of lollies
 hte less i enjoy a film
, the more i eat
. so all the lollies weere gone in 15 minutes
;
but
however empty the bag turned out to be
, it wass still a long way ahead ofthe tje movie
