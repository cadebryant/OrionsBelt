whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask
. i have beeen a fan of both the orginial series
and its recently retired follow
- uv
, as well as the even
- numbered entries in the film series
.
however
, i hvea never been one ofthe thsoe folks who store away trek minutiae
adn get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs
. data
. somewhere allong the line
, the
" star trek
" film series began to seem more
and more directed at those in tje latter category
,
and star trek
: generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction
. its production values may be high
,
but the writing is frequently appalling
,
and instead of a scirpt has a collection of references
, in
- jokes
and ill
- defined characters
. generations opens in the late 23rd century
, where members of the original enterprise crew
, including captain james t
. kirk
( william shatner
)
, are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name
. noone sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus
, a mysterious ribbon of energy
. among those rescued from the nexus is long
- lived alien dr
. soran
( malcolm mcdowell
)
,
but he is none
- too
- pleased at bieng back in the real world
. seventy
- eight years later
, soran is still trying to get back tothe tghe nexus
,
and again encounters an enterprise
, this one led by captain jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
. soran ' s plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet
,
and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains
. i don ' t think it is an insult to fans of
" star trek
" to suggest that to a certain extent
, the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements inaddition a
" trak
" film
. it ' s about a chance to visist with old friends
,
and if they are involved in a truly intresting story it can be considered gravy
.
bu even that interpretation assumes that characterization has tothe be consistant
,
anbd in generations that jsut doesn ' t happen
. data
( brent spiner
) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing
. infact the film ' s major sub
- plot
, data decides to use a chip whic will give him human emotions
, a chip he has had in his possession for over a year
. what is his motivation for tkaing this drastic
and perhaps dangerous step
? he doesn ' t get a joke
. once the chip is in place
, spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data ' s new emotions
,
but the point isnt that he ' s no longer the data we know
. if the rest of tghe
" next generation
" cast farse any better
, it ' s only because they ' re on the screen so little thast they ' re simply window dressing
.
but
then again
, this story isn ' t really baout the new crew
. it ' s about kirk
and picard
, the cowboy
and thge politician
, sharing the screen
. thge huge surprise is tht william shatner blows patrick stewart away
. perhasp because he knows this is his last go
- round in the part that made him a legend
, shatner looks like he ' s having the time of his life
; stewart
, onthe the other hand
, borders on the deferrential
,
and isnt saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast
. stewart ' s edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount ' s hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind ofthe franchise the original casted was
: these are clearly the nto ready for big screen players
. by contrast
, the prologue which features scotty
( james doohan
)
and chekhov
( walter koenig
) is tyhe highlight ofthe the film
. these characters haev become part of the populare mythology
,
and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress
, it ' s a moment of high energy
. only thirty years of history can create a moment like that
,
and that ' s time this new crew doesn ' t have
. it certainly doesn ' t help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted
and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again
. it ' s also loaded with littel gags all aimed at those who are familiar enought with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition
. i wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold tothe the
" trek
" universe at this point woudl be anything
but baffled
and bored by what is going on
.
and what a waste of malcolm mcdowell
, who could have been a great monomanical villin
but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession
. ther are plenty of details both scientific
and of continuity to pik at
,
but to do so would be to ignore generations ' major flaws
.
however
, i would like to make one recommendation
: seatbelts
. not just for the enterprise crew
,
although you ' d think by the 24th century space travel wouldn ' t involve rolling around on the floor during a battle
. no
, i think the audience might need them more
. this journey is one bumpy ride
.
