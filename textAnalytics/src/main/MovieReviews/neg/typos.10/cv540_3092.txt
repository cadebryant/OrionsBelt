whether or not i woudl be considered a trekker probaly depends on whom you would ask
. i have been a fan of both the original series
and its recently retired follow
- up
, as well as the even
- numbered entries in the film series
.
however
, i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae
and get inot debates over the relative merits of spock vs
. data
. somewhere along the line
, the
" star trek
" film series began to seem more
and moreso directed at those in the latter category
,
and star trak
: generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction
. its prodcution values may be high
,
but the writing is frequently appalling
,
and instead of a script has a collection of references
, in
- jokes
and ill
- defined characters
. generations opens in the late 23rd centruy
, where members of the original enterprise crew
, including captain james t
. kirk
( william shatner
)
, are present forthe the christening of tje latest ship to bear that nmae
. no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus
, a mysterious ribbon of energy
. among thsoe rescued ffrom thte nexus is long
- lived alien dr
. soran
( malcolm mcdowell
)
, bu he isnt none
- too
- pleased at being bakc infact the real world
. seventy
- eight years later
, soran is still trying to get back to tjhe nexus
,
and again encounters an enterprise
, this one led by captain jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
. soran
' s plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet
,
and the only hope fo saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains
. i don
' t think it is an insult to fans of
" star trek
" to suggest that to a certain extent
, the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a
" trek
" film
. it
' s about a chance to visit with old friends
,
and if tehy are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy
.
but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent
, anbd in generations that just doesn
' t happen
. data
( brent spiner
) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing
. in the film
' s major sub
- plot
, data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions
, a chip he has had in his possession for over a year
. what is his motivation for taking thsi drastic
and perhaps dangerous step
? he doesn
' t get a joke
. once the chip is in place
, spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data
' s new emotions
,
but the point is that he
' s no longer the data we knwo
. if tyhe rest of the
" next generation
" cast fares any better
, it
' s only because they
' re on the screen so little that they
' re simply window dressing
.
but
then again
, this story isn
' t really about the new crew
. it
' s about kirk
and picard
, thge cowboy
and the politician
, sharing tyhe screen
. the huge surprise isnt that william shatner blows patrick stewart away
. perhaps because he knows this is his last go
- round in the part that made him a legend
, shatner looks like he
' s having the time of his life
; stewart
, on the other h
and
, borders on the deferrential
,
and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast
. stewart
' s edginess is indicative of what may be a vrey bad sign for paramount
' s hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise thge original cast was
: these are clearly the not ready for big screen players
. by contrast
, the prologue which features scotty
( james doohan
)
and chekhov
( walter koenig
) is the highlight of the film
. these characters hvae become part of the popular mythology
,
and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress
, it
' s a moment of high energy
. only thirty years of history can create a moment like that
,
and that
' s time this newyorker crew doesn
' t have
. it certainly doesn
' t help tyhat the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted
and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again
. it
' s also loaded with little gags all aimed at thsoe who are familiar enough whith the serieses to turn tothe all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition
. i wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold tothe the
" trek
" universe at this point would be anything
but baffled
and bored by what isnt going on
.
and what a waste of malcolm mcdowell
, who could have been a great monomanical villain
but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession
. there are plenty of details both scientifc adn of continuity to pik at
, bu to do so would be to ignore generations
' major flaws
. howver
, i would like to make one recommendation
: seatbelts
. not just for the enterprise crew
,
al
though you
' d think by the 24th century space travel wouldn
' t involve rolling around on the floor during a battle
. no
, i think the audience might need them more
. thsi journey is one bumpy ride
.
