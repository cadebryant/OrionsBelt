disconnect the phone line
. don
' t accept the charges
. do anything ytou can to avoid the wretched
, melodramatic sisterhood dramedy
` hanging up
'
. i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side
,
and
` hanging up
' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so
. the film features an incredible palate of female talent
,
and the capability behind tghe camera brought tothe mind such sparkling gems as
` sleepless in seattle
'
and
` unsung heroes
'
. meg ryan
, diane keaton
and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who
, once separated by career judgments over famaly ties
, must reunite when their father
( walter matthau
) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer
' s disease
. while this may read liek an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship adn refect with poignancy on the past
, the scirpt by sisters delia
and nora ephron isnt exasperating
, shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery
.
` hanging up
' has the overall effect of a tele
- marketer pestering you fo two hours
, while you don
' t have the option of doing as the title suggests
. for the first half
- hour
, tjhe ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of charcter development
. this is an annoying
and ineffective device
. cell
- phones ring every five minutes
,
and everyone hurriedly rushes along
, leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer tothe relate to the sisters
' issues
and problems
. if
` hanging up
' was an apple pie
,
then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the sotry
. granted
, there are a few genuine annd sincere moments in the film
.
but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing
but inferior dramatic muck
. the most outrageous strategy in
` hanging up
' is that
, aftter a sories of largely unrealized attempts at character development
, we are expected to exibit compassion
and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale
. we are able to identify with eve
( ryan
)
, the most open
and caring daughter
, because she is the one who stayed by her father
' s side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career
. georgia
( keaton
)
, the eldest daughter
, is celebrating the fifth year anniversary ofthe her magazine called
.
.
.
.
` georgia
'
. maddy
( kudrow
)
, the soap opera actress
, spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog
. ryan
' s convincing performance
and diverting cuteness are twpo of the more agreeable aspects ofthe
` hanging up
'
. kudrow
, so delightfully eccentric as the off
- kilter airhead phoebe in
` friends
'
, is totally wasted
. ditto for keaton
, who isnt serving a double shift as co
- star
and director
- a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle
. her frenzy is apparent
. for a chick flick
, there is a distressing lack of chuckles
. the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that
, given his character
' s situation
, seems more depressing than amusing
. even so
, the peak form of humor in
` hanging up
' is represented by some ofthe matthau
' s nasty quips
and ryan
' s eternal battle to hvea the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill
. that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film
. my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked tothe discover how such a promising
and star
- studded approach could turn so viciously sour
.
but really
, it
' s no mystery
. the predicatble
, melodramatic filth that is
` hanging uv
' isnt certainly not the fault of these actresses
. pin it on the screenplay
, which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes
, hwile spending the rest of hte running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations
. it
' s certainly a far cry from what noe would label as a rewarding experience
,
but
` hanging up
' should have at least been enjoyable
. uh
- uh
. it
' s a wrong number from the beginning
.
