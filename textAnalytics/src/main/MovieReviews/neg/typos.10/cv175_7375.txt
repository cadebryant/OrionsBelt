capsule
: one of the ten worst movies ever made
. christopher lambert vs
. evil ninjas in modern
- day japan
.
.
.
and nobody wins
. the hunted is such a bad movie
, so completely inept
and so totally brain
- damaged taht i could almost feel affection for it
. i could see mysef showing this movie to friends
and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it
, if it weren ' t alsot insanely xenophobic
and insulting
. christopher lambert plays a coputer
- parts salesman who ' s on business in japan
. he meets a slinky young woman
( joan chen
)
and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her
-
-
and
hten manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan
annd thier leader
( john lone
)
. apparently they had some unfinished business thgat could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered
. since lambert is a witness
, he ' s of course the next one to die
. let ' s stop
and think baout this for a second
. if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society
, he ' d have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock
. in this movie
, the ninja manage to kill just about everyone exept him
. i imagine hte japanesse gods smiled down on lambert
and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body
. you know what a goof field is
: that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to dont harm to you becomes a klutz no marter wqat their real dexterity is
. this isnt
, of course
, only the beginning of the movie ' s problems
. lambert eventually finds pseudo
- safty with a long
- haired modern
- day samurai
( yoshio harada
)
and his partner
-
- yoko shimada
, who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun
. they are the two best things in the movie
; inthe every scene they have authority
annd presence
,
and they actually look like they belong here
, even when dressed in full samurai armor
and wielding bows
. the script doesn ' t know what the hell to do with them
. lone
, as the bad guy
, is zero
- dimentional
. the only bad
- guy cliche he has to wallow arund in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him
. in the hunted
, this is elevated tothe the level of an insulting stereotype
. whta ' s funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes
-
- there ' s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver
,
and a girl in a pachinko parlor
-
-
but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful
. also
, the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack
-
- get the cd
-
- that manages to survive despite the drek it ' s been designed to accompany
. there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing
-
- a gory
, excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment
,
anbd
thne smothers it by trying to clumsily re
- couple the whole thing with the movie ' s relentlessly stupid plot
. by the time we get to the final showdown
, withthe lambert getting to wield his own sword
( which
, judging from the ham
- handed editing of noe scene
, was forged in seven hurs or so
)
, we no longer care
. we ' re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of thte key characters lives or dies
! somone once said that the key to good art
-
- good movies
, good books
, whatever
-
- is to start somwhere interesting
, end up somewhere interesting
,
and sohw respect for the audience all along the way
. this movie bungles two out of three
, badly
.
