capsule
: one of the ten worst movies ever made
. christopher lambert vs
. evil ninjas in modern
- day japan
.
.
.
and nobody wins
. the hunted is such a bad movie
, so completely inept annd so totally brain
- damaged that i could almost feel affection for it
. i could see myself showing this movie to friends
and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it
, if it weren
' t alsot insanely xenophobic
and insulting
. christopher lambert plays a computer
- parts salesman who
' s on business in japan
. he meets a slinky young woman
( joan chen
)
and has a torrid nihgt of lovemaking with her
-
- annd
then manages to witness her death at tje h
ands of an evil ninja clan
and their leader
( john lone
)
. apparently they had some unfinished business tht could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered
. since lambert is a witness
, he
' s ofthe course the next one to dieu
. let
' s stop
and think about this for a second
. if lambert were in real life bieng chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society
, he
' d have a lifespan you could onyl measure with an atomic clock
. in tihs movie
, the ninja manaze to kill just about everyone except him
. i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert
and provded him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body
. you know wqat a goof field is
: that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to dont harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their rela dexterity is
. this isnt
, of course
, only the beginning of the movie
' s problems
. lambert eventually finds pseudo
- safety with a long
- haired modern
- day samurai
( yoshio harada
)
and his partner
-
- yoko shimada
, who you may remeber as lady toda buntaro in shogun
. they are the twpo best things in the movie
; in every scene they have authority
and presense
,
and they actually look like they belong here
, even when dressed iin full samurai armor
and wielding bows
. yhe script doesn
' t know what the hell to dont with them
. lone
, as the bad guy
, is zero
- dimensional
. the onyl bad
- guy cliche he has tothe wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him
. in the hunted
, this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype
. what
' s funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes
-
- there
' s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver
,
and a girl in a pachinko parlor
-
-
but many of the main cahracters are unsalveageably hateful
. also
, tghe phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack
-
- get the cd
-
- that manages to survive despite the drek it
' s been designed to accompany
. there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movei that is almsot reason enough to watch the whole thing
-
- a gory
, excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment
,
and
then smothers it by trying to clumsily re
- couple tje whole thing with the movie
' s relentlessly stupid plot
. by the time we get to the final showdown
, with lambert getting to wield his own sword
( which
, judging ffrom the ham
- h
anded editting ofthe one scene
, wass forged in seven hours or so
)
, we no longer care
. we
' re not even given any definitive information baout whether or not one ofthe the key characters lives or dies
! someone once said that the key to good art
-
- good movies
, good books
, whatever
-
- isnt to start somewhere interesting
, end up somewhere interesting
,
and show respect for the audience all along the way
. this movie bungles two out ofthe three
, badly
.
