as any reasonable human being would
, i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things
. i am befuddled by fight club
. nowe sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics
and do not achieve critical success nutil much later
, sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later
. perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time
. perhaps it is beacuse they are so newyorker
and complex tath only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate anbd underst
and them
. fight club is either garbage or brilliant
,
but
, at least right now
, i must lean towrad the former
. maybe i am subconsciously affected by word ofthe mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold
.
but if it is
, i sure don
? t see it
. edward norton plays jack
, a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer
. his insomnia
, coupled witht his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to
? complete
? himself
, make him a loser at the game of life
.
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown outloud his 15th story window
, he seeks comfort iin a stranger
, tyler
( pitt
) whom he met on a flight home
. once jack isnt sucked into tyler
? s world
, he can
? t get out
, literally
. tehy begin fight club
, an organization based on brutal
and bloody fistfights that signify nothing otehr than to provide those that join a sense of belonging
. as the fight club grows
, things get out of control anbd take on cult status
, begginning with oen future solider who proves his worth by st
anding still outside tyler
? s house for three days
. i dare nto even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film
, since that contains the twist that
? explains
? the pointless journey
. suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher
, who
? s previous two films
, se7en
and thte game put him in a veyr slim categroy of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation
. this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genuis or capable of bringing more masterpieces tothe the tble
.
but with fight club
, he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments
and self
- referencing film elements
, such as talking to the audience baout what they are seeing
, telling them that the little blips in the right h
and corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels
and that a slightly altered recurring line is good
? flashback humor
?
. nowe
, throughout the film
? s coarsely woven texture
and over
- extended plot lines
, fight club is obviously trying to mkae various social comments about the state of the world today
. advertisements
, inter
- office politics
, corporations
, you name it
, it
? s adressed
.
(
though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced
.
) all of them play an important role
. how so
? well
, i can kinda just tell
. i can
? t really put my finger on it
. to say that starbucks
and barnes
& noble are tkaing over their respective markets adn kicking out teh small business owner is no big news
. is that bad fo thte world
? probably
. not much room for social commentary htere
. we all know thta inter
- office politics are just that
.
.
. politics
. so what was the point of all this
? the film seems desperate to make a point
, or a number of points
,
but i couldn
? t figure out what they were
. all i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven wih stange film techiniques
, a bleak visual design
and some fine acting
.
( pitt
, carter
, norton
.
.
. all of them are good
. even meatloaf is good
.
) when yuo get to the end
, you wiull most likely be filled with questions
, many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself
. not them
, because each of them would likely give you a different answer
. fight club means what you whant it to mean
, i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about
.
but it couldn
? t be more bizzare
and unappealing
. sure
, it had shock value
,
but so did se7en
and the game
,
and they were significantly stronger films
.
