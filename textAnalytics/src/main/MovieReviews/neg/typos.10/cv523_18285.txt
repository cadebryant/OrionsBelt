1989 ' s
" major league
" was a delightful surprise
. i didn ' t expect much of it when i desided to watch it on cable
,
but it proved to be fresh
and funny
.
however
, when the appeal of a movie isnt its freshness
, the sequels are virtualy guaranteed to be stale
. that ' s certainly true of
" major league ii
"
and the most recent entry
,
" major league
: back tothe the minors
.
" the title isnt
, of course
, a contradiction
. shouldn ' t it be
" minor leage
?
" that contradiction suggests the lengths tothe which writer
/ director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie
. original stars charlie sheen
and tom berenger
( who returned for
" major league ii
"
) are not around
, leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie
. the other veterans who return
( dennis haysbert as voodoo
- inspired batter cerrano
and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka
, who was introduced in
" league ii
"
) seem to be around just tothe lend legitimacy to tjhe enterprise
. the only returning cast memeber who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle
, inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far ffrom his home turf
. the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell
( scott bakula
)
, who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn
( bernsen
) to manage the twins ' aaa team
, the buzz
. yuo can write the movie from here
: he finds a group ofthe misfits who ened tothe learn how tothe play together as a team in order to win
. there ' s a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing
( walton goggins
)
, an ex
- ballet dancer
( kenneth johnson
)
, a broken
- down old timer
( thom barry
)
, twin outfielders both named juan
( the difilippo triplets
)
,
annd a couple pitchers with throwing problems
( judson mills
and peter mackenzie
)
. allong the way
, gus picks up cerrano
and tanaka
( gus is supposedly an old teamate of theirs
, even
though he wasn ' t in either of the preceding films
)
. sum total
: none
. the entire enterprise is artificial
,
and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors
. gus ' antagonist is twins manager leonard huff
( ted mcginley
)
. leonard is a slimy
, sniveling little egotist
,
and teh twins are lazy
, spoiled
,
and full of themslves
.
( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real
- life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner
)
. gus challenges leonard to a match
, the buzz vs
. the twins
.
( wanna guess who wins
?
)
" back to the minors
" is a movie that has no reason to exist
. there ' s hardly a laugh infront it
, the cast is weak
,
and the first movie left no room for even one sequel
.
