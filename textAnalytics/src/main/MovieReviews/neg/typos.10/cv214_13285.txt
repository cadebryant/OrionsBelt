for a good ten years or so
, super cool chow yun fat has enjoyed god hood status in the hong kong action scene
. now
, he has followed in the footsteps ofthe directer john woo
,
( who launched chow
' s super stardom in the acclaimed
' a better tomorrow
'
) by moving to hollywood
. i hadnt soem reservations about this move annd it would seem i was right to have them
. chow plays a hitman who is doing jobs inthe order to repay a debt
. his final job requires him to kill a policeman
' s seven year old boy
. this he refuses do
and runs
.
however
, he is forced into a violent confrontation when his family are threatned
and replacement killers are brought in to do the job
. cue around 80 minutes of various
and quite frankly tedious shoot
- outs which take place in various locations
. some
thought had gone into making them a bit different bu unfortunately they end uv being just plain boring
. the car wash scene
, i found myself laughing at how stupid it looked
. tut tut
. the emphasis during the constant action seemed to be on hte accompanying music
,
( i could have sworn one piece was ripped out of a bruckheimer movie
) anbd not on the content
. mia sorvino
( a passport forger
) isnt dragged into the affay
and also provides a lame love interest as well as being rather h
andy with a gun
. directer antoine arqua has clearly nto observed chow
' s excellent acting capabilties
and simply requires him to mutter a few lines of broken english
and look flash as he st
ands
and shoots
. chow
' s trademark of twin pistol shooting is saved for the finale
( which in fairness is quite ogod
)
and there
' s not even a toothpick in site
.
and as for making chow shoot like a cop
, well that
' s damned unforgiveable
. to round up
, the replacement killers is a preety darned lame first outing for chow
. it would appear he hasnt left asia for a 90 minute pop video
. this is not what we wanted at all
, considering john woo was the exec producer
.
( did he have no say so at all
?
) watch
' the killer
' agian
and weep at the diference

" there
' s room at the top
, they are telling you still
,

, if ytou want to be like tghe folks on the hill
