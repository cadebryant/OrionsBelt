" pokemon 3
: the movie
" has a lot of bad things in it
. first of all it
' s a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents
, badly written scirpt
and fantastic animation
. the first film cameback out the end of 1999
and was a huge hit grossing almost
$ 90 million domestically
. a sequal soon folowed
and even made
$ 45 million
. warner has released theri third movie based on the immensely populare video gmae
and tv series
and its a waste of time
and celluloid
. this time ash ketchum
and his friends are on their way to the johto battles
( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is
" pokemon
: the johto journeys
" so go figure
) anyway he comes in contact wiht a young girl who
' s father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown
. they are small pokemon with a powerful punch
and have great psychic abilities
. the unown bring together their psychic abilities
and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly
' s hous
and creates every wish she wants
. now it
' s up to ash
and his friends to stop this pokemon entei
and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one
. too bad really that this is a bad movie
, surprisingly the first movie wass entertaining
and somewhat absorbing
, the second was a piece of trash anbd this one is almost in between
. it has some good qualities
( animation
, message in the end
)
but the flaws seem to overpower the goods
. i
' m still not sure what the big thing is baout pokemon
, they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language
( besides meowth
, my personal favorite
)
and you don
' t underst
and what they are saying
. my little brother just
thought the movie was amazing
, adn i kept leaning over
and asking him happened
, or what pokemon that was
. his response was a big lecture ofthe how this is that
,
and that is this
.
.
. he sure did put me in my place
. with the second
and third movie being bad
, i have a feeling pokemon 4
: the movei might be a total bust as well
.
" pokemon 3
: the movie
" has some redeeming qualities for the kids
,
and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film
. for those parents
and
/ or brothers
and sisters who have to sit through this
.
.
. bring a pillow
.
