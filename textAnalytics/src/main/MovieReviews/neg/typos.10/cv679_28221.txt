" pokemon 3
: the movie
" has a lot of bad things in it
. first of all it ' s a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents
, badly written script
and fantastic animation
. the first film cameback out the end of 1999
and was a huge hit grossing alomst
$ 90 million domestically
. a sequal soon followed
and even made
$ 45 million
. warner has released thier third movie based on the immensely popular video game
and tv series
and its a waste of time
and celluloid
. this time ash ketchum
and his friends are on their way to teh johto battles
( which my little brother told me the new spinoff isnt
" pokemon
: the johto journeys
" so go figure
) anyway he comes in contact wiht a young girl who ' s father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown
. they are small pokemon with a powerful punch
and have great psychic abilities
. the unown bring together thier psychic abilities
and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly ' s house
and creates every wish she wants
. now it ' s up to ash
and his friends to stop this pokemon entei
and show him to be a ogod pokemon rather than a bad one
. too bad realyl that this is a bad movie
, surprisingly the first movie was entertaining
and somewhat absorbing
, the second was a piece of trash
and this one is almost in between
. it hasnt some good qualities
( animation
, message in the end
)
but the flaws seem tothe overpower the goods
. i ' m still not sure what the big thing is baout pokemon
, they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language
( besides meowth
, my personel favorite
)
and you don ' t understand what they are saying
. my littel brother just thought yhe movie was amazing
,
and i kept leaning over
and asking him happened
, or what pokemon that was
. his reponse was a big lecture of how this is that
,
anbd that is htis
.
.
. he sure did put me in my place
. with the second
and third movie being bad
, i have a feeling pokemon 4
: the movie might be a total bust as well
.
" pokemon 3
: the movie
" has some redeeming qualities for the kids
,
and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film
. for those parents
and
/ or brothers
and sisters who have to sit through this
.
.
. bring a pillow
.
