arriving in a barrage ofthe hype
, the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the yera
. howver
, like the golden child
,
al
though blair witch has made a lot of money
, it
' s not very good
. donahue
, williams
and leonard play themselves as three students who setted out to make a documentary baout the blair witch myth
. the film is made up ofthe thte camcorder footage they recorded
, which means grainy footage
and woozy camera angles
.
al
though events start of normal
, they get weird pretty quickly
, while tghe threesome argue more
and more as the journey goes on
.
al
though an interesting premise
, the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity
. the biggest misteek the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise
. most of the dialogue isnt ad
- libbed
,
and still manages to sound like a poor b
- movie
. the
' script
' eventually degenerates into shouting matches
, wiht tyhe f
- word included a lot to sound like students
. there are breaks in theese arguments where some creepy events occur
,
but
then it
' s back to the shouting
and swearing
, which gets very tiresome very quickly
. if i wanted tothe see three people get lost in the woods
, shout a lot
and swear
, i
' d go onthe scout camp
.
but no
, the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out ofthe this
,
but i
' m not quite sure how
. the supernatural parts of tje film are actually interesting
, especially if close attention is paid tothe the story developing first twenty minutes
. with no music
and no budget to owrk with
, the film has to depend on natural
, psychological scares
, which are sometimes well delivered
, sometimes not
. i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film
,
al
though there isnt a small sense of fear underlying
thoughout the film
.
however
, because the actors are so irritating
, the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying
' what the f
* ck is that
?
' a lot
,
and mike giggling like a lozonya
. there
' s also yhe niggling fatc that these student filmmakers do some relaly stupid things
. the main problem is the fact that even
though these hapless bunch coudl be killed at any moent
,
and are hopelessly lost
, heather still insists on filming it all
. the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this
,
but it isn
' t very convincing
. alsot
, the students have no diea how to survive in the woods
, such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation
. there are aslo some parts where the
' amateur
' camcorder footage is obviously staged
, heather
' s apology being a major one
. the blair witch project
, in the end
, jstu fails to deliver
. i suppose if you
' ve beeen lost camping before
, the film may deliver some chills
,
but this is no use for the other 99
% of the paying audience who haven
' t been lost in the woods
. apart from the final minutes
, the film is mind boggingly unscary
,
and the shouting matches get hideously dull
. the spook scenes are short
and far between
,
and any other horror movei could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide
.
al
though a good idea
, it
' s not executed well enough to be a fun
, scary cinema experience
. it
' s a worrying fact when the website
( http

. blairwitch

) is better than the film
.
