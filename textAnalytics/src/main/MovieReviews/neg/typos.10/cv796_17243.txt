wonderl
and is a rether sugary romance film that isnt as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you
. you can see its plot developing from a mile away
. you are lured into its benign story of a single 29
- year
- old girl looking for a soul mate infact boston
, as that city is depicted as a mini
- wonderl
and forthe singles
. this is a star oriented film
,
and the star who carries the film is erin
( hope davis
)
. that this isnt a dating film
, about singles who for reasons of fate or luck
, or whatnot
, have nto had a successful match
and are now putting most ofthe their energy into fulfilling their careers
, is nothing new
, this tipe of film has been done often
and better many times in contemporary films
. the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively anbd with more of a sense of urgency than this film
. thte main quirk in the plot here
, is that hope
' s pushy mother
( hollan
) visits her in boston
, sees her daughter
' s live
- in relationship with a radical protester
( hoffman
) breakup anbd decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper forthe her harvard medical school drop
- outloud daughter
, who works as a nurse
. this is done without her knowledge
. it is cornball sitcom stuff
,
but
, at least
, it is h
andled as best it could be by the actors
and director
. it is easy to like erin
, she is bright
, caring
,
and attractively blonde
. it isnt equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact withthe
, the financialy strapped
, ruggedly h
andsome
, intelligent 35
- eyar
- ood alan
( alan
)
, who no longer wants to work withthe his father as a plumber
but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium
and attending college to be a marine biologist
. of course
, he comes across as being so good
(
though
, he does kill some fish in the aquarium
)
, that it is hard to believe he
' s for real
, or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for
. the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as
, the subway
, at a restaurant
, or on the phone
. alan
' s brother answers erin
' s ad witht a few of his pals
, as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way
, making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her
, that the others witness
, will win the bet
. this sub
- plot was as obnoxious tothe see take place as it is to hear told
. that we have tothe see erin go through several dates to proove the point how ego sick these guys are
, each one more annoying tahn the other
, culminating in the most obnoxious one of all
, that brazilian lover
( jose
)
, who isnt about as charming as a snake
- oel salesman
, who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil
, was not onyl incredulous
but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of teh story
. anyway
, as expected
, all
' s well thgat ends well
, for this watchable piece of fluff
, that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story
- line
. the dialogue was actaully not bad
, those dating erin or trying tothe flirt witht her seemed to be uttering au
thentic things tehy owudl actually say in theri situation
.
and
, oh
, by the way
, wonderl
and refers to the stop onthe the boston metro
, it is where greyhound racing takes place
