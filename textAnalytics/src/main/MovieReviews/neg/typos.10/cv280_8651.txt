capsule
: lesbianism examined in the same hushed
and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness
. potentially interesting idea made stagy
and boring
. claire of hte moon is such an impossibly serious
and sober movei that i was waiting for someone to sneeze
, just to break the ice
. it ' s a perfect example of what my wife calls an s
. f
. e
. movie
, where s
. f
. e
. means so f
*
*
* ing earnest
. movies like this need wit
and brashness to be absorbing
. claire is one strained speech after another
, written delivered with all of the energy
and spontenaity of a dmv clerk
. claire takes twpo women
, claire
and noel
, both writers
,
and throws them together in tyhe smae cabin at a women
- only writer ' s retreat
. claire wrights light comedy
, while nole is a scholarly authority on porn
and sexual behavior
. obviously
, the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about
,
and for the entire one hundered
and twelve insufferable minutes of this movei
, that ' s all htey do
: talk
. the movie sets up its
( microscopic
) plot with beat
- a
- dead
- horse
- into
- glue obviousness
. tje evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie
, a self
- professed lesbian
,
and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian
, claire looks like she ' s been hit with a sockful ofthe wet sand
. the movei
then quicklyu degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance
,
and claire looks outloud over the water reflectively
.
( ugh
!
) the most amazing thing about yhe movei is how people so intelligent can talk so much
and
yot get so little through their thick heads
. all ofthe this
, of course
, leads up to a scene of complete inevitability
: claire
and noel
, in a scene that shoud have come an hour earlier
, because
then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what ' s just happened
. we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone
, only how they felt about things taht didn ' t even happen
yet
. the problem with claire
.
.
. is not lesbianism as such
,
bu the leaden way it ' s handled
. why is it that any
" serious
"
( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful
) examination ofthe sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movei that ' s unwatchably boring
? tje way htis movie deals wih lesbianism
, we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids
. many other movies have used the same subject inspite ways that are a thousand times better
-
- more engaging
, more creative
, more intellectually
and artistically interesting
. look at john sayles ' lianna
, or the interesting
and little
- seen desert bloom
; both of them have more life
and vibrancy than claire
. what this movie needed was a ogod swift kick in the pants
.
