" showgirls
" is the first big
- budget
, big
- studio film to receive an nc
- 17 rating
.
and its release last year came at a time whn senator bob dole
and other politicans chastised the entertainment inudstry for promoting sex
and violence
.
but if
" showgirls
" is any indication ofthe hollywood
' s future
, the folks in washington should focus their attack onthe a more dangerous threat to american values
-
- bad moviemaking
.
" showgirls
" is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene
,
and the film turns out tothe be just as triarhy as its subject matter
. director paul verhoeven
and writer joe eszterhas
, who collaborated on another shock
- value project
, 1992
' s
" basic instinct
,
" follow the plight of a young woman
( teen tv star elizabeth berkley
) determined to mkae a name for herself as a topless dancer
. it
' s a hackneyed premise to begin with
, so nto surprisingly
, all of the stock characters are trucked out
. htere
' s the dem
anding producer
. thte loyal friend
. the bitchy competitor
. lest i forget the scummy club owner
. of course
, any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film
' s main attraction
-
- an endless parae of full
- frontal nudity
. unfortunately
,
" showgirls
" doesn
' t satisfy in this department
. verhoeven
' s slam
- bang
, in
- your
- face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic
. to make matters worse
, you
' ll be forced to sit through the movie
' s clothed scenes
, which don
' t cover uv for laughable acting
and some of thte most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film ihstory
. verhoeven
and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground
, bu if it
' s adult entertainment you want
, stay home
and watch the playboy channel
. you
' ll be the wiser for it
.
