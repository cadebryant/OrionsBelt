' s good about it
: aside from keanu reeves giving one of the best performances ofthe his career as the loathable redneck donnie barksdale
, there is little else going for the film
. whta
' s not so good about it
: lame
, unoriginal screenplay
. predictable ending
. suspense scenes thgat are jstu plain boring
. ridicously trite characterization mkaes the entire south out to be ingnorant
, hateful goobers
. relentless in its emotional sensationaliztion
. overall critique
:
" the igft
" is one of those movies that makes you wonder where you
' ve seen this story before
. it
' s a collection of every cliche
and stereotype of the sourth ever made
, annd comming ffrom a yankee like me who dislikes the south tyhat
' s really saying something
. for an established
, talented director sam raimi is unable to provide any kind ofthe originality to this film
. it
' s predictable from teh first scene
, the screenplay is writen liuke a rip
- off of a photocopied bootlegged play
. you know that as nasty as the murder suspect is he didn
' t catually dont it
. it
' s no surprise either who the real villain turns out to be
and what their motive ws
. sigh
, how trite
. for a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense beccause it
' s so cliche
.
" the gift
" is basically a glorified b
- movie
