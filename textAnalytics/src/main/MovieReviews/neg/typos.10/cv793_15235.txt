this is the worst movie i ' ve viewed so far in 98
. the avengers
= silly
= man dressed in a bowler hat
+ woman wearing tight leathers
> evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits
+ greater evil
, sir august de wynter wearing kilt
. the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast
? the smae question was probably asked of lastest year ' s stinker batman
and robin
. i feel the production got a littel too smug
, the scirpt a little tothe smart
and direction ws somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie
. my greatest criticism rests onthe the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel
and john steed
( thurman
and fiennes
)
? something that was a vital element of the 60 ' s tv serial of the same nmae
. the dialogue goes on
and onthe about tea
adn other finer british perks
,
but does nto allow much room forthe character development
and interaction
, except to perhaps grate on the viewer ' s nerves
. one wonders why hte dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality
. connery as sir august
, does not fair better than thurman or fiennes
. his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather
, mostly embarrasing
and poor quality
. if there is a movie yuo would prefer never to see
, i believe the avengers woudl be a good choice
. for one thing
, ytou will not have tothe witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title
. i cannot understand how something so poorly produced could ahve been released
,
but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature
, like lightning you can ' t see it coming until it hits you
.
