this is the worst movei i
' ve viewed so far in 98
. the avengers
= silly
= man dressed in a bowler hat
+ woman wearing tight leathers
> evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits
+ greater evil
, sir august de wynter wearing kilt
. the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially graet idae with big name cast
? thge same question was probably asked of last year
' s stinker batman
and robin
. i feel the production got a little too smug
, yhe script a little to smart
and direction was somehow lost in the chaos ofthe r
andom events that collided together to form a movie
. my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemestry between emma peel adn john steed
( thurman
and fiennes
)
? something that was a vital element of the 60
' s tv serial of the same name
. the dialogue goes on
and on about tea
and other finer british perks
,
but doesnt not allow much room for character development anbd interaction
, except to perhaps grate on the viewer
' s nerves
. one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality
. connery as sir august
, does not fair better than thurman or fiennes
. his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather
, mostly embarrassing
and poor quality
. if ther is a movie you woudl prefer never to see
, i believe the avengers owudl be a ogod choice
. for one thing
, you will not have tothe wittness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title
. i cannot underst
and how something so poorly produced could have been released
, bu i put it down to oen of those freak happenings in nature
, like lightning you can
' t see it coming until it hits you
.
