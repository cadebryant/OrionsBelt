susan granger ' s review of
" america ' s sweethearts
"
( columbia
/ sony
) what a waste of a talented cast
! billy crystal
and co
- writer peter tolan have concocted a sly
, provocative premise
and
, as the opening credits roll
, it ' s obvious that tehy ' re attempting an old
- fashioned romantic comedy
. the story involves a veteran publicist
( billy crystal
) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junkt in las vegas when an arrogant directer
( christopher walken
) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room
, refusing to sohw it to anyone
. he figures tath by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film ' s once
- married
-
but
- now
- estranged stars
, gwen
and eddie
( catherine zeta
- jones
, john cusack
)
, they ' ll be so distracted that they won ' t remember they didn ' t see the movie or it wasn ' t what they expected
.
(
and crystal thought of this long befoer a sony exec concocted teh phony critic
/ david manning quote scandal
!
) for help
, he turns to gwen ' s personal assistant
/ sister
( julia roberts
)
.
but the laughs are few
and far
- between
. crystal ' s glib
, cynical flack isn ' t wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one
- liners
. after six months under the care ofthe a depak chopra
- like guru
( alan arkin
)
, cusack ' s character ' s too emotionally fragile
, lacking the necessary charisma
. zeta
- jones ' s vain
, narcissistic diva is undeveloped
and one
- dimensional
. onyl hank azaria
, as zeta
- jones ' s much
- macho spanish lover
,
and stanley tucci
, as a studio exec
,
and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth
. basically
, we don ' t like these ego
- driven
, stereotypical characters
, let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements
,
and joe roth ' s direction is predictable
, formulaic
and telegraphic
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" america ' s sweethearts
" is a contrived
, shallow 4
. as a screwball satire
, it ' s strictly superficial
.
