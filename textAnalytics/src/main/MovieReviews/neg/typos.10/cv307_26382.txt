this is an adaptation ofthe h
. g
. wells
' acclaimed novel
' the invisible man
'
. the actors are kevin beacon annd elizabeth shue
. tghe directer is paul verhoven
. that
, plus a quick demonstration of tjhe amazing special effects in the trailer
, should be enough to lure us into the theatre
. the problem is to keep us there
. i can
' t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time
. working onthe a top secrect military project
, sebastian caine
( kevin beacon
)
-
- an eccentric genius
, thast calls himself
" god
"
, has discovered the secret to invisibility
. the first twpo faces are completed
. now
, it is time for
" the next logical step
"
-
- human
. caine volunteers for thsi risky experiment
.
but when he is made invisible
, something goes wrong
. while his ex
- girlfriend linda
( elisabeth shue
) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal
, he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower
.
but that
' s not the bad thnig
-
- an unexpected side
- effect of the drug sends him careening inot paranoid megalomania
. he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers
, just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower
and an explosion of about a quart ofthe nitroglycerine
. soon every sense of decency is forgotten
. the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control
and the film turns into an alien
- rip
- off
, where caine is walking like a half finished terminator
, spooking
, scaring
and killing everybody
.
though it
' s based on a novel called
' tyhe invisible man
'
, the title has been ironically changed to
' hollow man
' that sums up the film very nicely
. this is a very silly production
. laughable
, actually
. apparently verhoven
' s imagination doesn
' t stretch too far
. for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible isnt so you can case the girls
' locker room undetected
. it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie
. being invisible
, gives you the opportunity to be who yuo are
, to do what you want without bieng influenced by society
. in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences
. the nature of man
and his place in society is what the novel is truly about
. all that
, the depth
and true horror of the book is gone
and only special effects make you remane inwhich your seat
. caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man
.
but since this is a modernization
, in other words a dehumanization
, he doesn
' t stop there
. he becomes a rapist
.
and
then
, of course
, a murderer
. you
' ll start wondering why such actors as beacon
and shue found themselves in such film in the first place
. shue
' s talent is barely seen
, josh brolin is underused
and tyhe rest of the casted suffer mostly for the lack of talent
. kevin beacon is the only oney thta performs gracefully
. his face is not seen for the most part of the film
,
and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice
. there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing
. in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first palce
. being probably the best technical achievement since
" jurassic park
"
, they are absolutely amazing
. we observe hte layers of skin
, muscle
, tissue
,
and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly renedered invisible
. we see a beating heart
, inflating lungs
,
and veins pulsing with newly
- pumped blood
. there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke
, fire
, air
and water
,
but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for
? what is truly disturbing is that with a great book
, talented actors
and a gr
and budget
, this could have been so much more
. pretty much like jan de bont
(
" twister
"
,
" haunting
"
)
, paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary
. he was responsible for several ogod films
(
" basic instinct
"
and
" starship troopers
)
"
and soem incredibly bad films
(
" showgirls
"
,
" total recall
"
)
,
but he has never made anything that was great
. in a way
" hollow man
" fits perfectly in this collection
. it
' s not better or worse than verhoven
' s average film
. he proves once again that he is incapable of h
andling more complex issues
. adn so
, instead of depth annd chills
, verhoven inserts some of his trademarks
: stupid dialogue
,
and lot
' s of dull action with blood
and naked bodies
. he even throws in some of the worst of film clich
? s
- the slowly advancing fireball
, the villain who comes back from the dead
, etc
, etc
.
-
and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year
( you
' ll be screaming
" nooooo
!
"
and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion
)
.
and all we can ask is why
? the answer is simple
.
though hollywood is a movie producing machine
, the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money
. it has to be about telling stories
, not marketting them
. it has to be about transporting us to a different place
, to dazzle us with magic
and cleverness
. to make us care
, to make us thikn annd feel
. verhoven hasnt obviously missed thyat point
and this film is a proof of that
. it
' s all flesh
and bones
,
but no soul
. a void where its imagination shoudln be
.
