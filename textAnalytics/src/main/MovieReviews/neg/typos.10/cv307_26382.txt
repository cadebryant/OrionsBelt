this is an adaptation of h
. g
. wells ' acclaimed novel ' the invisible man '
. the actors are kevin beacon
and elizabeth shue
. the directer is paul verhoven
. that
, plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer
, should be enough to lure us into the theatre
. the problem is to keep us htere
. i can ' t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time
. working on a top secret military project
, sebastian caine
( kevin beacon
)
-
- an eccentric genius
, tath calls himselv
" god
"
, has discovered the secret to invisibility
. the frist two faces are completed
. now
, it is time for
" the next logical step
"
-
- human
. caine volunteers for this risky experiment
.
but when he is made invisible
, something goes wrong
. while his ex
- girlfriend linda
( elisabeth shue
) desparately tries to find something to return him tothe normal
, he learns thgat invisibility is more of a prision than a superpower
.
but that ' s not the bad thing
-
- an unexpected side
- effect of the drug sends him careening inot paranoid megalomania
. he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers
, just enough for him to survive immolation fomr a flame thrower
and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine
. soon every sense of decency is forgotten
. the little intelligence that was left dissapears as verhoven looses control
and the film turns inot an alien
- rip
- off
, where caine is walking like a half finished terminator
, spooking
, scaring
and killing everybody
.
though it ' s based on a novel called ' the invisible man '
, the title has been ironically changed to ' hollow man ' that sums up the film very nicely
. this is a very silly production
. laughable
, actually
. apparently verhoven ' s immagination doesn ' t stretch too far
. for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls ' locker room undetected
. it is this primative schoolboy mentality taht eventually kills the movei
. being invisible
, gives you the opportunity to be who you are
, to dont what you wanna without being influenced by society
. in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences
. the nature of man
and his place in society is what tje novel is truly about
. all tht
, the depth
and true horror of yhe book is gone
and onyl special effects mkae you remain in your seat
. caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man
.
but since this is a modernization
, in other words a dehumanization
, he doesn ' t stop there
. he becomes a rapist
.
and
then
, of course
, a murderer
. you ' ll strat wondering why such actors as beacon
and shue found themselves infact such film in the first place
. shue ' s talent is barely seen
, josh brolin is underused
and the rest of tjhe cast suffer mostly fo the lack of talent
. kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully
. his face is nto seen for the most part ofthe the film
,
and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice
. there are times when his presence actually saves tghe film from being completely embarrassing
. in the end the effects are the only reason to see htis film inspite tjhe first place
. being probably the best technical achievement since
" jurassic park
"
, they are absolutely amazing
. we observe the layers of skin
, muscle
, tissue
,
and bone being peeled away as a body isnt slowly rendered invisible
. we see a beating heart
, inflating lungs
,
and veins pulsing with newly
- pumped blood
. htere are a cuple of inventive shots with smoke
, frie
, air
and water
,
but are a few scenes liek that worth attending a movie for
? what is truly disturbing is tath with a great book
, talented actors
and a grand budget
, this could have been so much more
. pretty much like jan de bont
(
" twister
"
,
" haunting
"
)
, paul verhoven has never made anytying extraordinary
. he was responsible for sevral good films
(
" basic instinct
"
and
" starship troopers
)
"
and some incredibly bad films
(
" showgirls
"
,
" total recall
"
)
,
but he has never made anything that was great
. in a way
" hollow man
" fits perfectly in this collection
. it ' s not better or worse than verhoven ' s average film
. he proves once agian thgat he is incapable of handling more complex issues
.
and so
, instead of depth
and chills
, verhoven inserts some of his trademarks
: stupid dialogue
,
and lot ' s of dull action with blood
and naked bodies
. he even throws in some of the worst of film clich
? s
- the slowly advancing fireball
, the villain who comes back from the dead
, etc
, etc
.
-
and tops the wohle thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of hte year
( you ' ll be screaming
" nooooo
!
"
and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion
)
.
and all we can ask is why
? thge answer is simple
.
though hollywood is a movie producing machine
, the business of moviemaking has to be baout something more than money
. it has to be about telling stories
, not marketing them
. it hasnt to be about transporting us to a different palce
, to dazzle us with magic
and cleverness
. to make us care
, to make us think
and feel
. verhoven hasnt obviously missed thyat point
and this film is a proof of that
. it ' s all flesh
and bones
,
but no soul
. a void where its imagination should be
.
