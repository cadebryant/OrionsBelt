" comments
: thanksgiving
. for most
, it ' s a time to be with your loved ones
and enjoy a ogod
, home
- cooked meal
. for the makers of body count
,
howver
, thanksgiving is a time for multiple murders
, violence
, profanity
, family dysfunction
,
and sex
. boy
, do i feel all the more better having sat through this crap
. alyssa milano
, the former child star of who ' s the boss
?
, matures to made
- for
- video sludge like this movie
. someone somewhere thought it ' d be a great idea to pair her with rapper ice
- t
, who has since guest
- starred in the made
- for
- the
- sci
- fi
- channel series welcome to paradox
. this isn ' t exactly a winning combination
. outside of permenantly ruining a holiday for me
, what else may be said fo thsi turkey
? well
, it teaches us tyhat beautiful
, attractive women who look strikingly like alyssa milano fall in love with nerds who drive down long winding roads with their eyes closed
and complain about being english teachers
. it presents us with a heartwarming thanksgiving dinner attended by alcoholic
, stuck
- up rich white people waited on by black servants
. it shows us that old guys
, try not to laugh
, sit around
and talk about
" the appeal of postmodernism
" durring their free time
.
and
, it proves that you can have sex in your parents ' basement when they have a dozen or so guests over
,
and no one will notice
. before i go any further
, if any young male reading this has hopes ofthe seeing alyssa naked
, forget it
. thge filmmakers cleverly shoot the simulated sex scenes in a manner that makes sure you don ' t see any of milano ' s attributes
. they do
,
however
, inexplicably throw in a scene where ice
- t whistles
" jingle bells
" after killing people
, for whatever that ' s worth
. tihs film was originially titled below utopia
. perhaps htey shoudl have renamed it hell
. avoid this clunker
.
