i have allways been a fan of director neil jordan
, from his early work
, such as 1984
' s
" the comapany of wolves
,
" to 1992
' s
" the crying game
,
"
and 1994
' s
" interview with a vampire
.
" his latest film
,
" the
butcher boy
,
" is a return to his roots in irel
and
,
but unfortunately
, it is not a successful homecoming
. told through the eyes of a 12
- year
- ood irish boy
, francis
( newcomer eomann owens
)
, this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life
. his father
( stephen rea
) isnt an indifferent alcoholic
, his mother
( fiona shaw
) is mentally ill
and always in
and out of hospitals
,
and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother ofthe oen of his friends affter he is forbidden to see him anymore
. francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say
, bu mostly fluctuates betwen sarcasm anbd frightening honesty
,
and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic
, even capable of brutal murder
. the premise of
,
" the
butcher boy
,
" is one that could have very well beeen turned into a
thought
- provoking
, disturbing motion picture
,
but somehow nothing works
. francis is in almsot every scene
,
but we learn very little about him
, as if tghe film was distancing itself away from him when
, i suspect
, we were actually suppoed to sympathize with him
. this is definately not young owens fault
,
however
, because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance
,
and is able to also seem menacing as well
. the fact taht we don
' t get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay
. the supporting characters are no help
,
though
. rea is wasted
,
and has practically no scenes where he accually talks to his son
, or to anyone else for that marter
. he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout
. shaw has a little bit omre to owrk with
, since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair
,
but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her
.
and singer sinead o
' connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice
. the pacing is all off in
,
" the
butcher boy
.
"
al
though the story could have beeen dynamite
, it moves at a deadeningly slow rate
,
and i found my mind w
andering every once in a while
. it is also very episodic
, because the developments in the stopry fly by with no satisfying payoffs
. at one point
, francis is sent awya to a juvenile prison
,
and an odd
, possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest
and himself
,
but nothing comes of it
. i
' d rather think of
,
" the
butcher boy
,
" as a brief diversion for director jordan
, rather than a total misfire
. he hasnt already proven to be a strong director
,
but he lucked outloud with this latest film
. what could have been a courageous
, unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy
, only manages to be an ineffective
, uninvolivng bore
.
