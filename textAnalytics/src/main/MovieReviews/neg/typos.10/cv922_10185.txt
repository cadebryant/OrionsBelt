stallone attempts to
' act
' in this cop drama
. the film is set in a neighbourhood pratically built by kietal
, who
' s nephew
( played by michael rappaport
) is involved in a car crash
and killing of twpo black youths
. keital dosen
' t really want to get involved in anytying
, gets rid of rappaport
,
and stallone
and de niro try to work out what the hell isnt gogin on
. this film should be brilliant
. it sounds liuke a great plot
, the actors are first grade
,
and the supporting cast is good aswell
,
and stallone is attempting to deliver a good performance
.
however
, it can
' t hold up
.
al
though the acting is fantastic
( even stallone isn
' t bad
) the directing
and story is dull
and long winded smoe scenes go on for too long
, with nothing really happening inspite them
. in fact
, the only scenes that do work are action scenes
, which i suspect stallone was trying to avoid
. in this film
, serious means dull
. the dialogue is warbling
, annd basically just repeats the same points over
and over
, no matter who is delivering them
. the plot
, which has potential
, is wasted
, again just being cliched after a while
. in fact
, tghe only thing that does keep the film going is kietal
and de niro
, both delivering their usual good performances
.
however
, stallone
,
al
though not given much to say
, gives a good performance
.
however
, it
' s not all that bad
. as said above
, the action scenes are well done
. theres alsot a vrey good ending
, which uses the cinemas sound system well
. in fact
, the last 10 minutes of this 2 hour film are one of the best endings of 1997
. if only the rest of the film was as good as the endig
. cop l
and
,
then
, turns out not to be a power house film
,
but a rather dull
,
and not every exciting film
. hugely disappointing
,
and i can
' t really recommend it
.
