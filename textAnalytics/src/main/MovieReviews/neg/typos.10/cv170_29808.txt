mulholl
and drive did very well at the cannes film festival
. as you cxan see from the rating it doed not do vrey well from me at the toronto international film festival
. it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the runing time
. in fatc it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry
. toward the end ofthe the film i think everything that has been built falls appart
. the film was to be a pilot for a tv series
but writter
and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot
and i think he decided that he wanted to do something alse with it
. something else is what he did
. the film opens with a woman
( played by laura harring
) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life
. she crawls away from the accident with a concussion
and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep
. meanwhile young vivacious betty
( naomi watts
) arrives in hollywood from canada
. she wants tothe build a carrer as an actress
. betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow
. she does not nkow who the woman is
. she isnt even moreso surprised when the woman awakes
and does not herself konw who she is
. they fix on a nmae rita for her
,
but are not sure if this right or nto
. meanwhile local director adam kesher
( justin theroux
) has problems of his own
. he is trying to cast one actress fo his new film
and is getting pressure from the producers
and from crime figures to cast someone else
, cammie rhodes
( melissa george
)
. these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange
and comic murder that goes terribly wrong
. there is also a strange character called the cowboy
( monty montgomery
) adding to the confusion
. in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits
. a lot of mulholl
and drive starts out fun
. lynch wants you to know he could amke an enjoyable stylish film
. he just choosed not to
. as with any david lynch film there is strange material added fo little reason
. there are no earthworms
,
but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches
. the film is a little long for the subject matter
. toward the end it gets into soem heavier violence
and sex scenes
, clearly not intended for the tv pilot
. unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers
. i will not mention them in the main body of the review
but i give mulholl
and drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a low 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
. mulholl
and drive spoiler warning
. i have rated this film fairly low
. you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will nto see the film
. david lynch is in large part a dark satirist
. most of his work is done in familiar genres
but in some way shows their underside
. in mulholl
and drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense ofthe the crime film genre
. what he does with this film is
( are you sure you want to read this
?
) palying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on
. tyhe first 80
% of the film he tells a simple multi
- thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout
.
then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something
. the audience expectation isnt that they will add up
. bu he has given clues thyat are self
- contradictory
. lynch wants tjhe audience to argue about what they have seen afterward
and come up with theories
. in fact
, the pointers are noticeably contradictory
and until i hear a better explanation
, i think lynch is merely playing a joke
. there is a visual curiocity that was popular in the sixties
. mad magasine called it a poiuyt
. other sources called it a tri
- pronged u
- bar
. look at small portions of it
and makse sense
. look at the whole figure
and it does not
. this film is
, in my estimation
, the cinematic equivalent of a tri
- pronged u
- bar
.
