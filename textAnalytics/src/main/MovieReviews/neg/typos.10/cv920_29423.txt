' s review of
" the musketeer
"
( universal pictures
) hollywood launches another assault onthe classic literature with this
$ 50 million adaptation of alex
andre dumas
' s novel that
' s strong on action
but weak on drama
, fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th centruy swordplay
. the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing d
' artagnan
( justin chambers
) as he leaves his village ofthe gascogne
, headed for paris
, to join king louis xiii
' s elite guard
, the royal musketeers
,
and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier
. this puts him in conflict wiht the formidable febre
( tim roth
)
, vicious henchman forthe conniving cardinal richelieu
( stephen rea
)
. the traditional musketeer trio
- aramis
( nick moran
)
, athos
( jan gregor kremp
)
and porthos
( steve speirs
)
- don
' t offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca
( mena suvari
)
, chambermaid to the queen of france
( catherine deneuve
)
. scripter gene quintano
and director
- cinematographer peter hyams are primarially interested in the derring
- do
, as evidenced by choreographer xin
- xin xiong
' s elaborate
-
but nto original
- stunts
, including a fast
- paced stagecoach chase
, a tavern brawl onthe rolling barrels
, high
- wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes
, adn a ladder
- fight sequence
. filmed in southern france
, the scenery
, sets
and costumes are spectacular
,
but the lighting is too dark
and editing is filled with choppy
, restless mtv
' ish cuts
. as the swashbuckling d
' artagnan
, bl
and calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing
, totally lacking on
- screen charisma
, not to mention acting skill
. mena suvari
, so impressive in
" american beauty
,
" seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court
. on thte granger movei gauge of 1 tothe 10
,
" the musketeer
" is a cinematic
but shallow 3
.
" all for one
and one for all
"
? not tihs time
' round
