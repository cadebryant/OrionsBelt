a life less ordinary
( r
) hwile the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up tothe its title
, a more appropriate moniker owudl be a movie more misguided
, for this confuzled
, confusing attempt at romantic comedy isnt a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle
, producer andrew macdonald
,
anbd screenwriter john hodge
. at tjhe core ofthe this strange film is a fairly basic
-
-
and
, yes
, ordinary
-
- premise
. after robert
( boyle regular ewan mcgregor
)
, an aspiring writer of trashy novels
, is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation
, he kidnaps naville ' s
( ian holm
) spoiled daughter celine
( cameron diaz
)
and holds her for ransom
. the joke here is that celine is a willing victim
-
- her father threatend to cut her off financially
, so she wants revenge
-
-
and that she soon becomes nto only an accomplice
but the brains behind thge scheme
, teaching tghe inept robert a thing or twpo about kidnapping
.
.
.
and
, ultimately
( didn ' t we see this oney coming
?
)
, love
. so far
, so mediocre
.
but mediocre is better than dreadful
, which htis film is
, thanks in no small part to the hodge ' s contextual frame for the romance
. it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce
and romantic breakup rate on earth
, so tghe chief of heaven ' s police
, gabriel
( dan hedaya
) dispatches two angels
, o ' reilly
( holly hunter
)
and jackson
( delroy lindo
)
, to earth to hook up celine
and robert
-
- or lose their angel status
. this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture
.
but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film
; as it stands
, it isnt simply a waste of time that distracts ffrom the romance at hand
. not that there is much of a romance to begin with
. try as diaz
and mcgregor may
, celine
and robert are too one
- note to become very endearing characters
. celine is rich bitch
; robert is a dullard
. as such
, it is quite hard for the audience tothe really connect wih these two
-
-
then again
, they never seem tothe really connect withthe each other
. when celine
and robert start to overtly act on their
" feelings
,
" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natrual
.
but i am not exactly sure if boyle
and company ' s point ws romance
; honestly
, i am not exactly sure what they were trying to acompish
. boyle juices up the visuals wtih his characteristic razzmatazz
,
but it remains just that
-
- energy
, not energy in sevice of a story or even acting
. teh cast seems lost
, especially hunter
, whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling
.
adn
then there are tyhe many eccentricities splattered onto the film
: some violent confrontations involving the angels
, who are not exactly angelic
-
- in fact
, they end uv staging their own ransom scheme
; some mystical hokum in the climax
;
and a cutesy claymation epilogue
. watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell
, stockpiling quirks in the name of cool
. instead
, the film just gives quirky a bad name
. my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic
( yes
, misspelling intended
) whimsy
, which comes through in only one scene
: an extended musical number where celine
and robert sing
" beyond the sae
" at a karaoke bar
. after a verse or two
, the couple are magically dolled up inaddition snazzy outfits
and hairdos
,
anbd engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter
. the scene works not onyl because of its relative simplicity
but also because it does not try too hard
, just relying on the innate charm of the leads
, allowing them to build a romantic rapport
. alas
, not nearly enought is builded
, forthe this moment comes to an abrupt end
. i applaud any attept to bring something fresh
and unique to movie houses
,
but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill
. a life less ordinary certainly delivers something
" different
,
"
but by hte time tghe film was over
, i was clamoring for a life more ordinary
.
" i can accept failure
. everyone fails at something
.
but i can ' t accept not trying
. it doesn ' t matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart
.
