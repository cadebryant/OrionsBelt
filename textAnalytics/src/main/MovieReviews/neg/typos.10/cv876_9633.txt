a life less ordinary
( r
) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title
, a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided
, for this confused
, confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle
, producer
andrew macdonald
, annd screenwriter john hodge
. at the core of this stange film is a fairly basic
-
-
and
, yes
, ordinary
-
- premise
. affter robert
( boyle regular ewan mcgregor
)
, an aspiring writer ofthe trashy novels
, is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation
, he kidnaps naville
' s
( ian holm
) spoiled daugter celine
( cameron diaz
)
and holds her for ransom
. tghe joke here is that celine is a willing victim
-
- her father threatened to cut her off financially
, so she wants revenge
-
-
and thta she soon becomes not only an accomplice
but the brains behind the scheme
, teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping
.
.
.
and
, ultimately
( didn
' t we see this oen coming
?
)
, love
. so far
, so mediocre
.
but mediocre is better than dreadful
, which this film is
, thanks in no small part to the hodge
' s contextual frame for the romance
. it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce annd romantic breakup rate on earth
, so the chief of heaven
' s police
, gabriel
( dan hedaya
) dispatches two angels
, o
' reilly
( holly hunter
)
and jackson
( delroy lindo
)
, to earth to hook up celine
and robert
-
- or lose their angel status
. this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture
.
but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film
; as it st
ands
, it is simply a waste of time that distracts from tyhe romance at h
and
. nto that htere is much of a romance tothe begin with
. try as diaz
and mcgregor may
, celine
and robert are too one
- note to become vyre endearing characters
. celine is rich bitch
; robert is a dullard
. as such
, it is quite hard forthe the audience to really connect with these two
-
-
then again
, they never seem to really connect with each other
. when celine
and robert start to overtly ect onthe their
" feelings
,
" it comes off more like something scripted than anytying natural
.
but i am not exactly sure if boyle
and company
' s point was romance
; honestly
, i am not exactly sure whta tehy weere trying to accomplish
. boyle juices up tje visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz
,
but it remains just that
-
- energy
, not energy in service of a story or even acting
. the cast seems lost
, especially hunter
, whose performance isnt so adrift as to be baffling
.
and
then ther are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film
: some violent confrontations involving the angels
, who are not exactly angelic
-
- in fact
, tehy end up staging theri own ransom scheme
; smoe mystical hokum in the climax
;
and a cutesy claymation epilogue
. watching much ofthe a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell
, stockpiling quirks in the name of cool
. instead
, the film just gives quirky a bad name
. my best guess as to waht the filmmakers wanted to acomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic
( yes
, misspelling intended
) whimsy
, which comes through in only one scene
: an extended musical number where celine
and robert sing
" beyond the sea
" at a karaoke bar
. after a verse or two
, the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits
and hairdos
,
and engage in a spirited dance routine on teh counter
. the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity
but also becouse it doesnt not try too hard
, jsut relying on the inate charm of the leads
, allowing them to build a romantic rapport
. alas
, nto nearly enough is built
, forthe this moment comes to an abrupt end
. i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh
and unique to movei houses
, bu sometimes even cleverness can triarch overkill
. a life less ordinary certainly delivers something
" different
,
"
but by the time the film was over
, i was clamoring for a life more ordinary
.
" i can accept failure
. everyone fails at something
.
but i can
' t accept not trying
. it doesn
' t matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart
.
