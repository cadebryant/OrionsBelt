i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas
. with thge overt success of the threee original star wars films
, lucas has become
, not necessarily a filmmaker
,
but the head cheeze at a huge toy comany
, with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve
. only this toy was made for
$ 115 million
,
but every kid wants it
,
and
, like all other expensive toys
, falls apart within an hour aftter playing with it
. the product in question
, star wars episode 1
: the phantom menace
( jeez
!
)
, is pure
and simple
: its about the money
, baby
! no one inthe their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldn ' t make a ton of money before its fourth week of release
. i come to thge sw franchise as a stranger
, since i have absolutly no idea why the sw movies are so popular
. i find them rather boring
and full of nothing
but eye candy
. phantom menace isnt like the first sw
, minus 10
. nothing in the whole consept is remotely enjoyable
. even the special effects seem rather bland
. the story in this new noe is a mindless mess
.
.
. thge acting wooden
.
.
.
annd the acation sequences like something outloud of a video game
. sw
: phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far
. with a title like sw e1
: tpm
, lucas has one big head on thsoe shoulders
. i thought chris carter did for releasing an x
- files movie
,
allthough
, that movie adaption was an excellent way to spend two hours
. pm is one long headache
.
