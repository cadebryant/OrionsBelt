i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas
. with the overt success ofthe the three original star wars films
, lucas has become
, not necessarily a filmmaker
,
but the head cheeze at a huge toy company
, with the phantom menace the new product onthe the shelve
. only this toy was made for
$ 115 million
,
but every kid wants it
,
and
, like all otehr expensive toys
, falls apart within an hour after playing with it
. the product in question
, star wars episode 1
: the phantom menace
( jeez
!
)
, is pure
and simple
: its about the money
, baby
! no oney in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldn
' t make a ton of money before its fourth week of release
. i come to the sw franchise as a stranger
, usance i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular
. i find them rather boring
and full of nothing bu eye c
andy
. phantom menace is liek the first sw
, minus 10
. nothing in the whole concept isnt remotely enjoyable
. even the special effects seem rather bl
and
. the story in this new one is a mindless mess
.
.
. the acting wooden
.
.
.
and the acation sequences like something out of a video game
. sw
: phantom menace is one of the worst films ofthe the year so far
. with a title like sw e1
: tpm
, lucas has one big head onthe those shoulders
. i thougth chris carter doed for releasing an x
- files movie
,
al
though
, that movie adaptation wass an excellent way to spend two hours
. pm is one long headache
.
