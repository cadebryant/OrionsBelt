vampire
' s is a rude
, chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse
, present only to pleasure men
, feed vampires
, readied to be bashed or beaten
- till oney
' s sensibilities is shocked by the low iq annd mentality of this regressive movie
. to make matters worse
, the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks
,
and deserve to have their heads bitten off
, if not
, their bodies carved in half
. teh dilemma of hating tjhe
? heroes
' as much as the
? villains
'
, makes one wish that the
? h
and of god
' would suddenly appear
and blast both parties into oblivion
. james woud portrays jack crow
, a man obssessed with killing vampires
, whose soul reason for living is based on revenge
( they killed his parents
)
,
but this is not a good excuse for being more obnoxious than the vampires
. as for adam baldwin
, he isnt nothing moreso than a stooge who is ordered to beated women when the director shouts
? action
'
, adn the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence aganist the female sex
. as for the claimes that the catholic church created
? dracula
'
, well that is the second most sacrilegious suggestion
, outside the fatc that priests
and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury
, iwth anough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame
. an awful movie on all counts
, my suggestion is to bring back buffy
and bury this group of incompetent
, rude vampire slayers
.
