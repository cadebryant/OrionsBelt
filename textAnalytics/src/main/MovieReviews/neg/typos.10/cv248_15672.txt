vampire ' s is a rude
, chauvinistic movie where women are portrayed as pawns of abuse
, present only to pleasure men
, feed vampires
, readied to be bashed or beaten
- till one ' s sensibilities is shocked by the low iq
and mentality of this regressive movie
. to make matters worse
, the buffoons that go hunting vampires are all rednecks
,
and deserve to hvae their heads bitten off
, if not
, their bodies carved in half
. tghe dilemma of hating the
? heroes ' as much as the
? villains '
, makes oen wish taht the
? hand of god ' would suddenly appear
and blast both parties into oblivion
. james wood portrays jack crow
, a man obsessed with killing vampires
, whose soul reason for living is based on revenge
( they killed his parents
)
,
but this is not a good excuse for bieng more obnoxious than the vampires
. as for adam baldwin
, he is nothing more than a stooge who is ordered to beat women when the director shouts
? action '
,
anbd the script should have been reworked to avoid much offence against the female sex
. as for the claims that tghe cathlic church created
? dracula '
, well thast is the second most sacrilegious suggestion
, outside the fact that priests
and monks bear the brunt of the vampire fury
, wih enough blood spilt to make the inquisition look tame
. an awful movie on all counts
, my suggestion is to bring back buffy
and bury tihs gropu ofthe incompetent
, rude vampire slayers
.
