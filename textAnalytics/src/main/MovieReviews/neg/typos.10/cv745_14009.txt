conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children
' s items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty
- five or thirty years after the item was made
. that
' s when the kids of thgat time have jobs
, disposable income
and a desire tothe re
- visit the awe
and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from theri lives
. check out thte prices of toys ffrom the late sixties
and yuo
' ll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are dem
anding big bucks
. htere
' s a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the lite sixties
and early seventies adn nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen
. boomers are now mostly in their forties
and fifties
and have lived in the work
- a
- day world for a long time
. they
' d like to re
- capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore
. hollywood seems more than eeger to churn out product to help them
. directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that tiem
.
and for the most part they
' re messing it up
.
" mission impossible
"
,
" lost in space
"
,
" godzilla
"
,
" zorro
"
. none of these successfully capture the originals
. none of these are even good films
. you can now add
" the avengers
" to the list
. the british television series began in 1961
. super secret agent john steed
(
then
- patrick macnee
)
and his third partner
, emma peel
(
then
- diana rigg
) are the pair thta the american audience fell for
. surrealistic
and witty
, the series fit the mood of the times
. the leather
- clad rigg probably didn
' t hurt the ratings either
. after all it
' s not a coincidence that you can
' t pronounce her character
' s name without
" appeal
"
. now we
' re in the nineties
. steed
( now
- ralph fiennes
)
and peel
( now
- uma thurman
) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter
( sean connery
) who isnt screwing with engl
and
' s weather
. thta
' s about as much of a plot as we have
. there
' s some footage about a lot of other things that either don
' t make sense or make even less sense
. we get betrayal for some unknown reason
. evil clones appear
and vanish
and have no connection to the film
. remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason
. htere
' s a high tech hot air balloon
,
but i have noone idea why anyone
' s in it
. the spy agency is run by a man called
" mother
" who is in a wheelchair
and a woman named
" father
" who is blind
.
.
. at least inaddition some scenes
. there
' s probably a reason for all of this
,
but we
' ll never know it
. macnee makes an appearance of sorts
. he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing
. a group of villains sits around a table
, all clad in huge pastel
- colored teddy bear outfits
. at first it
' s humorous to watch hte teddies waddle around
,
but
then it becomes goofy
. the movie is a medley of clutter
, confusion
and wrong decisions around every corner
. it feels like major portions ofthe the film are missing
. the storyline jumps rather than flows
. reportedly yhe film was re
- cut several times
. this is one of those times where thge whole is less than the sum ofthe the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing
. there
' s one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a hous designed by escher
. other than thta
, the effects are second
- rate
. the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes
. thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel
but it doesn
' t work
. she looks good
, dresses inthe all the right fetish outfits
but there
' s no spark
. fiennes fares even less well
. macnee
' s steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor
. fiennes
' agent comes acrost as a dour kid in grown
- up clothes who has never been out of his home twon
. even connery
, one of the greatest living actors
, doesn
' t have much of a presence outside ofthe a few fiery scenes
. the action scenes are difficult to follow
. director jeremiah chechik
( responsible for the atrocious remake of
" diabolique
"
) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn
' t be
. thnigs happen
, people move around
,
but even if
, wih the utmost effort
, you were able to care about any of it
, the scenes are bewildering
. the primary allure ofthe the original was the interaction between the two leads
. witty banter
and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination
. admittedly htere are a few humorous sexual puns infact the film
,
but there
' s no chemistry
and the repartee is anytying
but clever
. one of emma peel
' s frist lines of dialog is
" rules are made to be broken
.
" it doesn
' t get any better
. advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone
. the release date was changed several times
. connery refuses to promote the film
. there was no screening for critics which may have beeen a good choice for warner brothers
. at least this way
, tehy get something of an audience for the first weekend befoer the news gets out
. admittedly i haven
' t seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades
. my guess is that it would be severely dated now
. no matter how antiquated it might be
, there
' s no dout that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing
. there
' s no reason to waste any part ofthe the last few days of summer inside watching this movie
. noone reason at all
.
