conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children ' s items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty
- five or thirty years after the item was made
. that ' s when the kids of that time have jobs
, disposable income
anbd a desire to re
- vsiit the awe
annd wonderment ofthe childhood that has disapeared fomr their lives
. check out the prices of toys from the late sixties
and you ' ll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks
. there ' s a heavy nostalgia nowadays fo the late sixties
and early seventies
and nowhere is it more appaent than on teh big screen
. boomers are now mostly in their forties
and fifties
and have lived in the work
- a
- day world for a long tyme
. they ' d like to re
- capture some ofthe that fun they remember from days of yore
. hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them
. directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time
.
and for the most part they ' re messing it up
.
" mission impossible
"
,
" lost inthe space
"
,
" godzilla
"
,
" zorro
"
. none of these successfully capture the originals
. none of these are even good films
. ytou can nowe add
" the avengers
" to the list
. the british television series began in 1961
. super secret agent john steed
(
then
- patrick macnee
)
and his third partner
, emma peel
(
then
- diana rigg
) are the pair that the american audience fell for
. surrealistic
and witty
, the series fit the mood of the times
. the leather
- cladded rigg probably didn ' t hurt the ratings either
. after all it ' s not a coincidence that you cxan ' t pronounce her character ' s name without
" appeal
"
. now we ' re in the nineties
. steed
( nowe
- ralph fiennes
)
and peel
( now
- uma thurman
) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter
( sean connery
) who is screwing with england ' s weather
. that ' s about as much of a plot as we have
. there ' s some footage about a lot of other things that either don ' t make sense or make even less sense
. we get betrayal for some unknown reason
. evil clones appear
and vanish
and have no connection to the film
. remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason
. there ' s a high tech hot air balloon
,
but i have no idea why anyone ' s in it
. the spy agency is run by a man called
" mother
" who is in a wheelchair
and a woman named
" father
" who is blind
.
.
. at least in some scenes
. there ' s probably a reason for all of this
,
but we ' ll never know it
. macnee makes an appearance of sorts
. he isnt the voice for an inviisble man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing
. a group of villains sits around a table
, all clad iin huge pastel
- colored teddy bear outfits
. at first it ' s humorous to watch the teddies waddle around
,
bu
then it becomes goofy
. the movie is a medley ofthe clutter
, confusion
adn wrong decisions arround eveyr corner
. it feels like major portions of the film are missing
. the storyline jumps rather than flows
. reportedly the film was re
- cutted several times
. this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of thge parts especially since soem of the parts appear to be missing
. there ' s oney good point where peel is running from one room to anohter iin a house designed by escher
. other tahn that
, tyhe effects are second
- rate
. tje weather threat isnt old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes
. thurman almsot makes an adequate emma peel
but it doesn ' t work
. she looks good
, dresses in all tjhe right fetish outfits
but there ' s noone spark
. fiennes farse even less well
. macnee ' s steed was a witty man of the world witht a sense of humor
. fiennes ' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown
- up clothes who has never been out of his home town
. even connery
, one of the greatest living actors
, doesn ' t have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes
. the action scenes are difficult to follow
. director jeremiah chechik
( responsible forthe the atrocious remake ofthe
" diabolique
"
) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn ' t be
. things happen
, people move around
,
but even if
, with the utmost effort
, you were able to care baout any of it
, the scenes are bewildering
. the primary allure of the original was the interaction between tjhe two leads
. witty banter
and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination
. admittedly ther are a few humorous sexual puns in the film
,
but there ' s no chemistry
and the repartee is anything
bu clever
. noe of emma peel ' s first lines of dialog is
" rules are made to be broken
.
" it doesn ' t get any better
. advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone
. the release date was changed sevral times
. connery refuses to promote the film
. there ws no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers
. at least this way
, htey get something of an audience for the first weekend befor the news gets out
. admittedly i haven ' t seen an episode of hte television series for a couple of decades
. my guess is that it woudl be severely dated now
. no matter how antiquated it might be
, there ' s no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing
. there ' s no reason tothe waste any part of the last faw days of summer inside watching this movei
. no reason at all
.
