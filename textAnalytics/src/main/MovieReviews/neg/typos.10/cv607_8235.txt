i feel sorry for the financial backers of
" waterworld
,
" which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made
( at
$ 172 million
!
)
,
and isnt also one of the stupidest
- boy did they get ripped off
! in fact
, this film is not really a movie
,
but mroe of an amusement park ride with a plot
. it
' s nto even just another case of cliches strung toghether
( well
, it is that too
)
, it
' s something that
' s painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws
. kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man
/ half fish
. he is an explorer
/ mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted
. he
' s referred to as the mariner
,
but they
" the meaner
" would have been a more appropriate title because he
' s cold
, rigid
, annd strict
-
and he
' s supposed teh be the good guy
! he docks at a small floating village of sorts
. he trades dirt for money
and thsi introduces us to the other important characters
. first we meet one of the villains
,
then the soon
- to
- be heroine
, a child prodigy
, a wacky inventor
,
and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today
,
but also smoe of the low
- tech tools used by pirates
and vikings
. immediately the film
' s biggest flaw is apparent
: are these peple primitive or highly advanced
? it doesn
' t seem like anyone can read
yet they have ski
- doos
and airplanes
! how are these things powered
?
and if they have airplanes
, couldn
' t they just keep flying until tehy reached dry l
and
? also
, if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things
? i
' m sorry
, i
' m all for checking your brain at the door when going to yhe movies
,
but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story
and confuse us
. there was potential here for a good pirate story set infront medieval times before modern technology
, so why mix the two together
? it doesn
' t make any sence
. there really isn
' t much of a plot here because the story moves so quicklyu it never takes time to explain anything
. the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child
, enola
( mojorino
)
, has a tatoo on her back that isnt supposedly a map to
" dryl
and
.
" who put the tattoo there
and how come it has taked them this long to figure tihs out
? we never get an answer
, just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryl
and
. to make a long
, boring
, stupid
, adn just plain bad story short
; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen
( tripplehorn
)
and enola
. they sail for a long time
, encountering some strange people in the proccess
and fight off
" the smokers
" as lead by the idiot villain deacon
( hopper
)
, who kidnaps enola
. the story becomes a overly gr
and adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons
, rescuing enola
,
and bringing them all to salvation
( how original
)
. even with all its special effects
, action
,
and adventure tihs film is boring
. not a single charachter is likable
, therefore neither isnt the plot
. dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholson
' s joker
, while costner just plain rips
. still
,
" waterworld
" is professionally made with a good production desgin
and an original idea
but no substance to it
. i just hope they don
' t make a sequel
!
