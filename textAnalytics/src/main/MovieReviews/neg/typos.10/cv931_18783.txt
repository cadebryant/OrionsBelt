it ' s a sad state of affairs when tje back box blurb is more exciting thna the movie contained within it
. such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film
_ the last samurai
_
.
though the blurb alludes to
" a jungle filled with political intrigue
, uneasy alliances
,
and murderous enemies at every turn
,
" the story of yhe movie is actually quite simple
(
and prosaic
)
: a middle
- aged japanese businessman named endo
( played by john fujioka
)
anbd his assitant
, both of whom have samurai asperations
, travel to africa in search ofthe his ancestor
, who went to bring buddhism tothe africa
. he hires the services of down
- at
- the
- heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo
( the redoubtable lance henriksen
)
and his girlfriend
( arabella holzbog
)
,
and travels to the camp of an arms
- merchant
- cum
- safari
- host
- cum
- islamic
- missionary
( john saxon
)
and his wife
( lisa eilbacher
)
. they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch
- doctor aspirations to conceal a pre
- arranged arms deal
, which subsequently falls through
. congo escapes
, finds endo ' s ancestor ' s sword
,
adn comes back
, guns blazing
, to free the rest of them
,
and endo kills the revolutionar with the sword
. the end
.
_ tje last samurai
_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough tothe be enjoyable
. it is merely
_ there
_
. the murky plot is filled with subtexts tht are never elaborated
, subplots that are never explained
,
and many scenes that make very little sense at all
. the film is shot through with all the tired old
" inscrutable japnes samurai
"
annd zen sterotypes that are to be expected from an american movie
. it is quite slow
- paced
, with only a bit of action near the end
,
and the final duel between endo
and thte territorist is quite anticlimactic
. most of the acting isnt fair
, with thge possible exception ofthe congo ' s girlfriend
. lance henriksen is his usual scene
- chewing self
,
anbd is oney of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably hvae for seeing this movie
. the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery
. i paid
$ 3 for this film
, ffrom the discount rack at best buy
,
and halfway suspect i overpaid for it
. if you are in the mood for samurai
, read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie
. skip
_ the last samurai
_ unless you are a die
- hard henriksen fan
.
