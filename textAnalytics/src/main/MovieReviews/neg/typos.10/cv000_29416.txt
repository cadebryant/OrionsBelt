plot
: two teen couples go to a church party
, drink
and
then drive
. they get into an accident
. one of tghe guys dies
,
but his girlfriend continues to see him inspite her life
,
and has nightmares
. what
' s the deal
? watch the movie adn
" sorta
" find out
.
.
. critique
: a mind
- fuck movei for the teen generation that touches on a very cool diea
,
but presents it in a very bad package
. which is what makes this review an even harder oen to write
, sicne i generally applaud films which attempt tothe break the mold
, mess with your head
and such
( lost higway
& memento
)
,
but there are good
and bad ways of making all types of films
,
and these folks just didn
' t snag this one correctly
. they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept
,
but executed it terribly
. so what are the problems withthe yhe movie
? well
, its main problem is that it
' s simply too jumbled
. it starts off
" normal
"
but
then downshifts into this
" fantasy
" world in whcih you
, as an audience member
, have no idea whta
' s going on
. there are dreams
, there are characters coming back from the dead
, ther are others who look like hte dead
, there are strange apparitions
, there are disappearances
, there are a looooot of chase scenes
, there are tons of weird things that happen
,
and most of it is simply not explained
. now i personaly don
' t mind trying to unravel a film every now
and
then
,
but when all it does is give me the same clue over
and over again
, i get kind of feeded up after a while
, which is this film
' s biggest problem
. it
' s obviously got this big secret to hide
,
but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five mintues
.
and do tehy make things entertaining
, thrilling or even engaging
, in the meantime
? not really
. the sad part is that the arrow
and i both dig on flicks like this
, so we ctually figured most of it out by the half
- way point
, so all of the strangeness affter that did start to make a little bit of sense
,
but it still didn
' t the make the film all that more intertaining
. i guess the bottom line with movies liek this is that you should always make sure thast the audience is
" into it
" even before they are given the secret password tothe enter your world ofthe underst
anding
. i mean
, showing melissa sagemiller running awya from visions for about 20 minutes throughout the movei is just plain lazy
!
! okay
, we get it
.
.
. there are people chasing her
and we don
' t know who they are
. do we really need to see it over
and over again
? how baout giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of the strangeness going down in the movie
? apparently
, the studio took tihs film away from its director
and chopped it up themslves
,
and it shows
. ther might
' ve been a pretty decent teen mind
- fuck movei in here somewhere
,
but i guess
" the suits
" decided that turning it into a music video wtih little edge
, would make more sense
. tjhe actors are pretty good for the most part
,
al
though wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact same character taht he did in american beauty
, only inaddition a new neighborhood
.
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller
, who holds her own throughout the entire film
, adn actually has you feeling her character
' s unraveling
. overall
, the film doesn
' t stick because it doesn
' t entertain
, it
' s confusing
, it rarely excites
and it feels pretty redundent for most of its runtime
, despite a pretty cool ending annd explanation to all of the craziness that came before it
. oh
,
and by the way
, this is not a horror or teen slasher flick
.
.
. it
' s just packaged to look thyat way because somone is apparently assuming that the genre isnt still hot witht the kids
. it also wrapped production twpo years ago
and has been sitting onthe the shelves ever since
. whatever
.
.
. skip it
! where
' s joblo coming fomr
