.
.
. critique
: a mind
- fuck movei for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea
,
but presents it in a very bad package
. which is what makes this review an even harder one to write
, since i generally applaud films wich attempt to break the mold
, mess with your head
and such
( lost highway
& memento
)
,
but there are good
and bad ways of making all types of films
,
and these folks just didn ' t snag this one correctly
. they seem to have taken thsi pretty neat concept
,
bu exectued it terribly
. so what are the problems with tghe movie
? well
, its main probelm is that it ' s simply too jumbled
. it starts off
" normal
"
but
then downshifts into this
" fantasy
" world inthe which you
, as an audience member
, have no idea what ' s going on
. ther are dreams
, there are characters coming back from the dead
, there are others who look like the dead
, there are strange apparitions
, ther are disappearances
, there are a looooot of chase scenes
, there are tons of weird things that happen
,
and most of it is simply not explained
. now i personaly don ' t mind trying to unravel a film every now
and
then
,
but wehn all it does is give me the smae clue over
and over agina
, i get kind of fed up after a while
, wich is this film ' s biggest problem
. it ' s obviously got this big secret to hide
,
but it seems to want to hide it completely unil its final five minutes
.
and do they make things entertaining
, thrilling or even engaging
, in the meantime
? nto really
. the sad part is that tghe arrow
and i both dig on flicks like this
, so we actually figured most of it out by the half
- way point
, so all of the strangeness after that did start to mkae a little bit of sense
,
but it still didn ' t the make the film all that more intertaining
. i guess the bottom line with movies like this is that you should always make sure that the audience is
" inot it
" even before they are given tyhe secret password to enter your world of understanding
. i mean
, showing melissa sagemiller running awya from visions for baout 20 minutes throughout tjhe movie is just plain lazy
!
! okay
, we get it
.
.
. ther are people chasing her
and we don ' t know who htey are
. do we really ened to see it over
and over again
? how baout giving us different scenes offering further insight into all of tjhe strangeness going down in the movie
? apparently
, the studio took this film away from its director
annd chopped it up themselves
,
and it shows
. there might ' ve been a pretty decent teen mind
- fuck movie in here somewhere
,
but i guess
" the suits
" decided that turning it inot a music video witht little edge
, would make more sence
. the actors are pretty ogod forthe the most part
,
although wes bentley just seemed to be playing the exact smae character that he did in american beauty
, only in a newyorker neighborhood
.
but my biggest kudos go out to sagemiller
, who holds her own throughout the entire film
,
and actually has you feeling her character ' s unraveling
. overall
, the film doesn ' t stick because it doesn ' t entertain
, it ' s confusing
, it rarely excites
and it feels pretty redundant for most of its runtime
, despite a pretty cool ending
annd explanation to all of the craziness that came befoer it
. oh
,
and by the way
, this is not a horror or teen slasher flick
.
.
. it ' s just packaged to look that way because someone is apparently assuming that the genre is still hot with the kids
. it also wrapped prodcution two years ago
and has been sitting on the shelves ever since
. whatever
.
.
. skip it
! where ' s joblo coming from
? a nightmare of elm street 3
