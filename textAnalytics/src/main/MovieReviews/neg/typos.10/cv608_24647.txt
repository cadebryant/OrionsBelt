to watch
` battlefield earth
' is to wallow in misery
. it is noe of yhe most ludicrously conceived efforts infront recent hstory
. it has a clumsily told story
, insipid dialogue
, shallow characterizations
, ugly scene transitions
, no evidence of dramatic arc
, headache
- inducing sound effects
,
and a resolution that is completely implausible
. worse
, there
' s the promise of a sequel
. why
?
! save your mney
. some films go quickly to video
. this one
,
however
, should go straight to thge sci
- fi channel
' s
` mystery science theatre
.
' in the year 3000
, man has become an endangered species
. most of humanity
( called
? man
- animals
'
) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens
( called psychlos
)
. survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved tothe mine earth
' s resources for the rest of their lives
. the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that st
and nine
- feet tall
, who resemble inbred klingons
. dimwitted as they are tall
, their culture is predicated on power
, extortion
,
and getting
? leverage
.
' travolta
, the leverage
- using star
, plays terl
, the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth
. much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl
' s petty machinations
. he routinely employs deception
and
then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter
. bu one thing is certain
; he hates being stationed on earth
. when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on tihs planet
, he begins to devise his latest plan
. he iwll select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site
. it
' s not clear how this benefits terl
, except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it
. the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler
( barry peppers
) isnt selected as the slave group
' s leader
. a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know
- how
. bu the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language
, teh principles of our founding fathers
, euclidean geometry
,
and the location of fort knox
. htis enlightenment just doesn
' t prepare him for the mining assignment
. it also prepares him to organize
and stage a massive revolt against theri captors
.
` we
' re going to blow uv their home world
,
' he says
.
`
but first
, we need a faw more supplies
.
' in days
, he
and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling
, loincloth wearing
, rat eating slaves to fighter pilots
and nuclear weapons experts
. by now
, tyhe audience is laughing as maniacally as terl
. the media have beeen working overtime to let the public know thast john travolta
' s labor of love isnt a piece of sci
- fi drivel
. numberous journals have called it an ill
- conceived idea stemming from blind hubris
, arrogance
,
and poor planning
.
and after watching this movie
, you
' ll wholeheartedly agree
. this is a terrible film thyat is illogically constructed
, tediously acted
,
and frequently begs the question
: why was this ever made
? at a price tag of
$ 90 million
, this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly
, assuredly becoming
` the avengers
' of this summer
. both films were unforgivable
and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate
and subsequent indignity
. infact adition to the universally pejorative reviews
, there
' s another bizarre element to the
` battlefield
' saga
. this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta
, who for over a decade
, hadnt been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen
. the controversy is that travolta is a scientologist
, adn
` battlefield
' isnt based on a 1982 novel by l
. ron hubbard
, the religion
' s late founder
. this led some to believe that
` battlefield earth
' would amount to scientologist dogma
, laden with subliminal messages
.
but the story is so poorly told tath any message
, subliminal or otherwise
, is totally undetectable
. if the audience got anytying out of this film
, it was this
: we are not too unlike the psychlo leader
. like terl
, the audience felt imprisoned
, dreaded their situation
,
and looked for any opportunity to leave
. coudl that be teh scientology message
?
