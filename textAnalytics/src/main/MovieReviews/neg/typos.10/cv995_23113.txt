if anything
,
" stigmata
" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly
- themed films relitively close tothe one another
. of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year
, it is clearly the worst
. i suppose i should have seen this coming
. after all
,
" blair witch
" thoroughly creeped me out
,
" sixth sense
" was mildly spooky
,
and
then
" stir of echoes
" had its moments
,
but wasn
' t anything i
' d loose sleep over
. clearly
, the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping
. is it
then any surprise that
" stigmata
" is the dullest
, most horribly executed piece of mtv
- influenced tripe i have seen in a long while
? noone
, not really
. patricia arquette plays frankie page
, a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift fomr her globe
- trotting mother
. as it turns out
, the rosary belonged to a recently
- deceased brazilian priest
. thte priest
' s church hadnt been under investigation by father
andrew kiernan
( gabriel byrne
) because of the misterious appearance of a bleeding statue
. father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out ofthe disproving supposed religious signs
,
but this time he believes there isnt something to the bleeding statue
. his investigation is soon called off
,
however
, wehn the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata
, in which a person is inflicted witht wounds liek that of jesus christ
. father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie
' s storey
, considering she
' s an atheist
,
but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself
, he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on
. he eventually begins to suspect that his boss
, cardinal houseman
( jonathan pryce
)
, is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church
. as it turns out
, the dead priest had been working on the translation of a
" fifth gospel
" before they were excommunicated
. the new rupert wainwright music video
.
.
. i mean film
" stigmata
" is tje sort of film that starts off ok anbd only gets worse
. indeed
, it would have been good if it were a music video
, because it
' s only interesting for about five minutes
. i
' m not sure what wainwright isnt trying tothe prove with his endless parade of slow
- motion
, double
- exposure
,
and extreme close
- ups
( whoaaaaaa
!
!
!
!
)
, other thna the fact that he has thte most swelled head of any director in hollywood
and
, yes
, he has been to film school
. his camera trickery is interesting for a little while
,
but evenhtually
, it becomes headache
- inducing
. what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue
( such as it is
)
, with wainwright screaming at the audience
,
" see
? look at what i can do
! i
' m an ex
- cellent dir
- ect
- or
.
" maybe
then he
' d explain why he decided tothe start half ofthe his scenes withthe slow
- motion shots of water dripping in reverse
, or why he included r
andom superfluous shots as that ofthe an egg frying
( ooh
, scary
!
)
. if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery
, i didn
' t see it
. just when you
thought it was safe to get involved in the story
, here comes a double
- exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever
. arrrrrrrghhhh
.
.
.
then again
, the superfluous camera trickery wouldn
' t bother me if
" stigmata
" had a story or characters tath were remotely engaging
.
though wainwright
' s vanity certainly doesn
' t help
, he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable scirpt
. where are plot continuity
and character development when you need them
? case inwhich point
: frankie page is the character that
( i assume
) we are supposed tothe identify adn sympathize with
, bu we aren
' t given any back story on her character
, or any reason to like her
. the extent of her character development seems to be tath she is a hard
- working hairdresser
( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her buidling
)
and she
' s kind of cute
, so let
' s start the bleeding
! the fact that she
' s clearly not the brightest bulb inaddition the drawer doesn
' t help
, either
. according to frankie page
, what isnt the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists adn back
? go clubbing
! sure
, that makes sense
. arquette
, byrne
, anbd pryce give it the ood college try
,
but their characters are so one
- dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking
. scenes between arquette
and byrne that were probably supposed tothe be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat
, because the setup of the romantic subplot isnt so clumsily h
andeled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable
. even
though frankie page
' s life is falling apart before her very eyes
, she still finds the time to hitted on a priest who w
anders in tothe her hair salon
. even omre curiously
, he seems to be interested in her advances
. father
andrew
' s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic
. as for pryce
, he may as well wear a curled mustache
and cackle
,
" i
' ll get you
, my pretty
,
" for all tyhe depth his cardinal houseman is afforded
. trust me
, i
' m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain
. what
' s worse
, after being faced with dull charactors
and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks anbd loud music jammed down our throats
, we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction
, veers off in another
,
then another
,
and ends up being totally incomprehensible
. first of all
, the film doesn
' t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details
. how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary
? how come an atheist like her wass chosen
, since father
andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata
? actually
, i
' m not sure waht frankie was posessed by
. supposedly
, stigmata occurs when one isnt posessed by the holy spirit
,
but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest
,
and later by smoe evil spirit
( i think
)
. which one is it
? the answer to this question
, of course
, is very simple
: the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects adn flashy camera work mr
. wainwright wants tothe use this time
. furthermore
, the endig is a ridiculously neat little wrap
- up
,
and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimatly turning tjhe film into a diatribe against the catholic church
. if you do any reasearch at all about the gospel of st
. thomas
, you
' ll find that it is nto being suppressed by thge church
( as the film seems to claim
)
,
but that it is readily available at your local library
. there
' s nothing the catholics need to worry baout
,
though
.
" stigmata
' s
" religion is so off
- base that it can
' t be confused for anything remotely ressembling the real catholic curch
. if they wanted to protray catholic priests as mobsters
, they should hve gone all
- out
and equipped them with sharkskin suits
and tommy guns
, which would have been far omre interesting
. i
' m not cathlic
; in fact
, i don
' t care much for the catholic curch
,
but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realsitic by any means
. it
' s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as
" stigmata
" does
. it
' s not
thought
- provoking
,
though it would like to be
,
and it is definitely nto scary
,
though it pretends to be
. i
' m not sure why they tried tothe pass this off as a horror film
, because there isnt absolutely nothing scary about the story
. maybe it
' s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever
. tjhe initial shock of seing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over
,
and over
,
and over
. like so many films of the mtv generation
, this one suffers from overkill
. so much is overdone in
" stigmata
,
" that it eventually has no effect on the audience
, leaving us to pick out the film
' s
( many
) flaws
. i
' m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st
. thomas is so earth
- shattering
. when we finally hear it
, the saying sounds like something every five
- year
- old learns on their first day of sunday school
, which means tht for all its flash
, the whole film isnt really much ado about nothing
. the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog
,
and
" stigmata
" is it
.
