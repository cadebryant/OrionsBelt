a number of critics have decided that it ' s opn season on freddie prize jr
.
, slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in sound
- alike
, disposable teen fluff like
" head over heels
,
"
" boys
and girls
,
"
" down to you
"
anbd
" she ' s all that
.
" while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend
, his talent is not
. i first saw him infront the independent dark comedy
" the house of yes
,
" where he gavey a subtle
, impressive performance as the yuonger brother in oney of america ' s freakiest familes
. prinze hasnt the acting chops
; he just needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown
- up movies to show the non
- believers that he has what it takes
.
" summer catch
" certainly won ' t help his case
. inoffensive
,
but utterly generic
, the baseball
- related romantic comedy does little more than kill time
. the story deals with yhe love affair between tenley
( jessica biel
)
, a wealthy cape cod girl
and ryan
( prinze
)
, a local boy ffrom a wroking class family who dreams of becoming a big
- time baseball star
. ryan ' s preoccupation with his newyorker honey
- bunny drives her elitist father
( bruce davison
) crazy
and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team
. it ' s a wonder the kid has any time to pitch
, as his time is ocupied with mkaing out withthe tenley
, fighting with her dad
, bonding with his own dad
( fred werd
, who deserves better than htis
)
, fighting with his brother
( jason gedrick
)
and carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates
. tje filmmakers desparately want to make a quirky
, character
- heavy baseball movie like
" bull durham
,
"
but haven ' t got a clue how to get there
.
and so they glide from one clich
? to tje next for 108 minutes
. the only bit ofthe originality comes fomr marc blucas in a minor role as a center
- fielder fomr texas
. in an early barroom scene
, blucas
, best known as demon
- fighting riley finn from
" buffy the vampire slayer
,
" hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass
,
then turns to teammate matthew lillard
and states
,
" he does have a nice ass
. a bubble butt
.
" when lillard gives him an
" are you insane
?
" look
, blucas calmly says
,
" it ' s nothing sexual
,
"
then goes on to evaluate the hind
- ends of some other players
, including lillard ' s
. speaking of asses
, prinze does not bare his in the movie
. the actor hasnt a no nudity clause in his contract
, so two stunt
- butts were employed for a couple of semi
- nude shots
. blucas
, whose character secretly dates a large woman throughout the story
, gets another unique moment late in the film
. sick of hearing teammates make
" fat chick
" jokes
, he climbs on top of a table
and loudly declares his love of amply
- sized ladies
. hwile his speech still ends up objectifying women
, it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie
. trivial tidbit
:
" summer catch
" markes a scooby doo summit
. marc blucas appears in
" jay
and silent bob strike bcak
" as fred from the scooby doo gang
, while freddie prinze jr
. plays the same character inthe the upcomming big budget film version of the old cartoon
.
