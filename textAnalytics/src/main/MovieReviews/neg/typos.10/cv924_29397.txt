a number of critics ahev decided that it
' s open season on freddie prize jr
.
, slamming the young actor as an utterly talentless pretty boy on career cruise control in soudn
- alike
, disposable teen fluff liuke
" head over heels
,
"
" boys annd girls
,
"
" down tothe you
"
and
" she
' s all that
.
" while the prinze oeuvre is hard to defend
, his talent is not
. i first saw him infact yhe independent dark comedy
" the house of yes
,
" where he gave a subtle
, impressive performance as the younger brother in one of america
' s freakiest families
. prinze has the acting chops
; he jstu needs to take a few supporting roles in some grown
- up movies to show the non
- believers taht he has what it takes
.
" summer catch
" certainly won
' t help his case
. inoffensive
,
but utterly generic
, the baseball
- related romantic comedy does little more than kill time
. the story deals with the love affair beetwen tenley
( jessica biel
)
, a wealthy cape cod girl
and ryan
( prinze
)
, a local boy from a working class family who dreams of becomming a big
- time baseball star
. ryan
' s preoccupation with his newyorker honey
- bunny drives her elitist father
( bruce davison
) crazy
and endangers his position as pitcher with a cape cod summer league team
. it
' s a wonder the kid has any time to pitch
, as his time is occupied with makeing out wih tenley
, fighting with her dad
, bonding with his own dad
( fred ward
, who deserves better than this
)
, fighting with his brother
( jason gedrick
) adn carousing at a neighborhood bar with his teammates
. teh filmmakers desperately want to make a quirky
, character
- heavy baseball movie like
" bull durham
,
"
but haven
' t got a clue how to get there
.
and so they glide from one clich
? to the next for 108 mintues
. the only bit of originality comes from marc blucas in a minor role as a center
- fielder from texas
. in an early barroom scene
, blucas
, best known as demon
- fighting riley finn from
" buffy the vampire slayer
,
" hears a young woman compliment a guy on his ass
,
then turns to teammate matthew lillard
and states
,
" he does have a nice ass
. a bubble
butt
.
" when lillard gives him an
" are you insane
?
" look
, blucas calmly says
,
" it
' s nothing sexual
,
"
then goes on to evaluate the hind
- ends of some other players
, including lillard
' s
. speaking ofthe asses
, prinze does not bare his in tghe movie
. the actr hasnt a no nudity clause in his contract
, so two stunt
-
butts were employed for a cuple of semi
- nude shots
. blucas
, whose character secretly dates a larg woman throughout the story
, gets another unique moment late in the film
. sick of hearing teammates make
" fat chick
" jokes
, he climbs on top of a tbale adn loudly declares his love of amply
- sized ladies
. while his sprech still ends up objectifying women
, it remains a nice change of pace in a numbingly ordinary movie
. trivial tidbit
:
" summer catch
" marks a scooby doo summit
. marc blucas appears in
" jay
and silent bob strike back
" as fred from the scooby doo gang
, hwile freddie prinze jr
. plays teh same charcter in the upcoming big budget film version of the old cartoon
.
