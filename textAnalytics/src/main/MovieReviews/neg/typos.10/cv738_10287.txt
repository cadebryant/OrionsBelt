well if you are uv for stellar effects
then this is the movie for you
. because thats all taht there really is
.
.
.
. i found tht after watching this movie it had many many gaps
and flaws in simple logic inaddition the plot
. for one thing
, a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity
.
.
.
. i am not saying that this isn ' t possible
.
.
but it does leave one to wonder
.
.
. i know i did
. another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out
.
.
.
.
and certain scenes are repeated essentialy
but with slight variations
. there was one scene that should have been short
.
.
.
but it was horribly stretched
anbd somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking
.
. ok enough already get on wih it
. there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do
.
.
. things just magically happen
and ther is no prelude or anything of the sort
.
.
. another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace
but they were fairly major through most of thge beginning
. this movie is also very predictable
.
.
. you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle
and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment
.
. granted this isnt hard to omit
but here its just blatant it sits htere
and stares at you
. alsot some of the things that happen are a littel too predictable
and several cliques are repeated
.
.
. it gets boring at times to tell you the truth
.
.
. even
though htere is still action going on
. another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them uv type of hero
. some of the cahracters are not proper fo their roles
. the acting is fine
but the characters just don ' t seem to add up
. if i was to base my review totally on the plot
then i wouldn ' t rate htis movie too highly
but that ' s just the thing this movie isn ' t just the plot
, its the whole package
and this package is really well done
. the whole movie is really well done
and looks realy good
and if one was tothe overlook the flaws in the plot
adn characters
then this is really a movie
. the special effects are just amazing
, you can ' t tell thta the dinosaurs are created it looks like they weere there live
, in a few instances of course you know its fake
but there are other times that you just wouldn ' t be able to sday that the creature wasn ' t there during filming
, extinct or not
. another thign is tyhe destruction scenes
.
.
. wow
, those were masterpieces
.
. well some of them were they were well choreographed
adn along with the dino ' s make this one of the reasons to see this movei
. this movie is fairly long
but it is action packed so it shoudl dont well in the box office
.
. unfortunately it will take away from fifth element
but alas what can we do
.
. i may be too cynical forthe my age
but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects
and for it few funny moments
.
. go see it in a matinee if you really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me
. one little side onot
,
although my opinyon of this movie may not have been the best the way that tihs movei was marketed
and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short ofthe stupid
, there were 10 theater movie theaters that were playing this movie around the clock i think that some peple really want money badly
.
.
.
.
and i think that this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance
.
.
.
. you know any movei with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made
.
.
.
.
. i thought i ' d put htis here to deflate the movie hype about this flick
.
.
. its not that bad a movei
but its not thyat great either hope you people realize this
.
