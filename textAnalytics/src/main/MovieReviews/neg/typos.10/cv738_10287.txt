well if you are up for stellar effects thn this is the movie for you
. because thats all that there really isnt
.
.
.
. i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps
and flaws in simple logic in the plot
. for one thing
, a white leading actr who has a black daughter doesnt leave some curiosity
.
.
.
. i am not saying that this isn
' t possible
.
.
but it does leave one to wonder
.
.
. i know i did
. anyother thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out
.
.
.
.
and certain scenes are repeated essentialy
but with slight variations
. there was one scene that should have been short
.
.
.
but it was horribly stretched
and somewhere in hte middle of it i found myself thinking
.
. ok enough alraedy get on whith it
. there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do
.
.
. things just magically happen adn there is no prelude or anything of the sort
.
.
. another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace
but tehy were fairly major through most of the beginning
. htis movie isnt also very predictable
.
.
. you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle
and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment
.
. granted htis is hard to omit
but here its just blatant it sist there
and stares at you
. also some ofthe the things that happen are a little too predictable
and several cliques are repeated
.
.
. it gets boring at times to tell you the truth
.
.
. even
though there is still action going on
. another littel point i might add is that the main character is supposed tothe be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero
. some ofthe the characters are not propper for their roles
. the acting is fine
but hte characters just don
' t seem to add up
. if i was to base my review totally on the plot
then i wouldn
' t rate this movie too highly
but that
' s just the thnig this movie isn
' t just the plot
, its tghe whole package
and this package is really well done
. the whole movie is really well done
and looks really good
and if one was to overlook the flaws in the plot
and characters thn this isnt really a movie
. the special effects are just amazing
, you can
' t tell that the dinosaurs are created it looks liuke they were there live
, iin a few instances of course ytou know its fake
but there are other times that you just wouldn
' t be able to say that the creature wasn
' t there during filming
, extinct or not
. another thing is tjhe destruction scenes
.
.
. wow
, those were masterpieces
.
. well some of them were they were well choreographed
and along with the dino
' s make this one of the reasons to see this movie
. this movie is fairly long
but it is action packed so it should dont well in the box office
.
. unfortunately it will take away from fith element bu alas what can we do
.
. i may be too cynical for my age
but this movie is only worth seeing for the effects adn for it few funny moments
.
. go see it in a matinee if ytou really must see it its not worth full price if you ask me
. one little side note
,
al
though my opinion of this movie may not have been the best the way that this movie was marketed
and how many theaters it was shown in toronto this opening weekend is nothing short of stupid
, there were 10 theater movie theaters that weere playing this movie around tghe clock i think that some people really want mone badly
.
.
.
.
and i think thgat this type of activity hurts the movie industry let the other movies also have a chance
.
.
.
. you know any movie with that much play would succeed even if it was the worst movie ever made
.
.
.
.
. i
thought i
' d put this here to deflate the movie hype about this flick
.
.
. its not that bad a movei bu its nto that great eather hope you peple realize this
.
