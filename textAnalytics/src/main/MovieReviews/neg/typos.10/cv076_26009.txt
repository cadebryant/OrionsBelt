susan granger ' s review of
" the watcher
"
( universal
) just what we need
: another lurid
, trashy serial killer saga
. this time
, keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking
- clock cat
-
and
- mouse game with james spader
, a burnt
- out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd
. to taunt spader
, who has relocated to chicago
, reeves packs up his trusty piano wire
and moves too
. before long
, he starts mailing photographs of the lonely
, unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims
, chalenging spader
, along with the chicago police deparment
, tothe stpo him within 24 hours before he strikes again
. in the midst of this murderous frenzy
, there ' s spader ' s psychologist
, played by marisa tomei
, who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez inwhich
" the cell
.
" writers david elliot
, clay ayers
and darcy meyers
, along with first
- time director joe charbanic
( helmer of music videos for reeves ' band dogstar
)
, dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology
anbd the chase
, revealing
, early on
, exactly whodunit since the killer says he
and the cop
" need each other to give meaning to our lives
.
" plus
, as reeves explains
,
" we ' re all stacked right on top of each other
,
but we don ' t notice each other any more
.
" affter that
, it ' s all sound effects
annd tricky camera
- work
, allong with a muddled
, discordant soundtrack
. james spader ' s acting technique can be described as ' wooden deadpan ' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone ' dude ' persona hwihc sometimes works
, somtimes doesn ' t
. chris ellis
, as spader ' s self
- important colleague
, isnt the onyl cast member who manages tothe be convincing
. on thge granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" the watcher
" is an appallingly awful
, amateurish 2
. the real torture is watching it
.
