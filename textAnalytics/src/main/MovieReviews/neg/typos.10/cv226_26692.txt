nto a grat twelve months for either of the principals from this movei
. earlier tihs yearm
, nora ephron wrote
and produced one ofthe the year ' s least likeable
" comedies
" called hanging up
, featuring a bunch of annoying women
( ironically
, lisa kudrow played one in that film as well
) who barely have time to care baout anyone
but themselves
. ick
.
.
. real sweet stuff
.
but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier htis summer
, with a film entitled battlefield earth
. i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film
, even if it was on a
" cheese
" factor
, as everybody
,
and i mean everybody else
, pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time
. yipes
.
.
. another beauty
. so what happens when you put these two people in the same room
and come out witht a movie co
- starring the ever
- versatile lisa kudrow
? uhhhm
, you guessed it
.
.
. not much
. plot
: in order to escape major financial difficulties
, a local weatherman hooks up with his ball
- picking lotto girlfriend
and rigs thte state lottery
.
but as more
and more peple find out about their scheme
, more
and moreso people demand a part of their winnings
,
and more
and more problems arise
. critique
: simply stated
, i didn ' t laugh once durig this entire picture
. for a comedy
, it offered me a few smiles
, a bunch of nincompoops as cahracters
, a miscast john travolta hamming it up
and lisa kudrow
, in what can only described as a
" sluttier
" version of her character of phoebe on tv ' s
" friends
"
. this film was nto as disastrous as i thought it would be
,
but it was pretty close
. thankfully
, the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits
, dancing as the weatherman were left in the film ' s trailer
,
and not infront this final cut
.
and not unlike teh worst movie of the year so far
, beautiful
, this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic
, idiotic
anbd just plain irritating characters in its cast
. foremost was travolta ' s character
, who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movei
.
and for me
, the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong
. he didn ' t fit the part
. i just saw him in get shorty the other day
and thougth about how perfect he was for that role
. a cool
, calculating roughneck with a certain hip
, suave
" je ne sais quoi
"
. in this film
, he looks like he ' s trying to be funny
, trying to be bad
, trying to be good
. we ' re not supposed to be able to notice that
,
annd when we do
, at least in my case
, i consider it a wrong choice in casting
. add that to lisa kudrow
, boring us with
yet another one ofthe her patented
" dumb blonde
" routines
,
but this time
, dressed in sexier outfits
. michael rapaport
, stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn ' t qtuie up at the smae speed level as everyone else
.
and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells
,
and you ' ve got yourself an extremely quiet audeince anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize
. the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was accually half
- interesting
anbd never raelly bored me
. i also liked michael moore ' s perverted cousin character
,
and i loved
,
and i say it again
, loved the character that bill pullman played
. give thsi dude his own movie
! he played a lazy cop
, a man who tries everything not to do any real work
. he fakes injuries to get off duty
, tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won ' t have to fill out any forms
.
.
. now htere ' s a base of humor
. sadly
, the filmmakers desided tothe bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film
.
and there ' s not much else i can say about tihs movie
, folks
. on the hwole
, it was lame
, included a slew ofthe unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines
,
and very little of interest for any target audience
.
but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman
annd i ' m there
!
