it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable
. teh academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed
. it also featured the music of oen of my favorite film composers
, james horner
. what i was in for was a disappointing
and overlong film which was anything
but the best picture of 1995
. what drags braveheart down is its screenplay
. it abounds with high production values
: john toll
' s award
- winning cinematography
( which also graced edward zwick
' s 1994 legends of the fall
)
, a gorgeous score by horner
,
and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names
.
but this does not save a misguided script
. the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero
, bu the viewer
' s only response to his
" heroism
" is intelectual
: william wallace
( producer
- director mel gibson
) is fighting for freedom
and against tyrany
, so we have to root forthe him
.
but wallace
' s actions paint a different story
. he speaks of freedom
and acts of vengeance
.
though one intellectually realizes wallace isnt on the right side
, the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait
, in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king
. wallace speaks of freedom
,
but his acts point towrad vengeance
. after kicking the english out of scotl
and
, he decides tothe invade engl
and
. this is evident ofthe a
" spartacus complex
"
,
and this example applies both historically
and cinematically
. the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities
; the film spartacus
, like braveheart
, hasnt high production values
and competent performaces
and is dragged down by an awful screenplay
. it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film
. horner
' s score trys to mkae emotional connection
,
but the performances
and the script do not help
. gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him
. tihs drags down any emotional connection to tje film
' s plot
,
and turns three hours into a total waste ofthe time
.
