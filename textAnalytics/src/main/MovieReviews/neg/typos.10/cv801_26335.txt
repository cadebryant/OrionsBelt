and potentially intresting elements to the original plot
. instead of norman bates we ahev twpo brothers
- one of them traumatised physically
, another mentally
. sexual tension between beautiful female patron
and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presense ofthe alcoholic husb
and
. eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense
, with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere
. the acting is fine
- hopper
, gregg annd boyle are comfortable with their roles
,
but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine
. unfortunately
, eye of the storm
, which was supposed to be intense psychological drama
, deteriorates into cheap
and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale
. in the end

' t prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities
