in the past
, tim burton has taken cinema by storm with the action packed batman
,
and the hilarious ed wood
,
but lately his films just don
' t cutted it
. sleepy hollow has some unique features
,
but the script is a terrible mess
. forthe those who remember disney
' s fantastic
" adventures of ichabod crane
"
, it isnt actually superior to this
. disney
' s version was at least interesting
, while burton
' s film drags on far too long
, without any suspense or frights
. while tje stories are similar
, the new version adds too much tothe the once likable story
,
and throws inaddition some weak dialogue to top it off
. ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) is now apparently a constable
, who was sent to new york to investigate suspicious murders
. the victims are headless
,
and no traces of evidence were found
, until the murderer reveals himself
, hence the headless horseman
. now with the help of christina ricci adn an orphaned boy
, they must stop the headless horseman from a killing spree
, that could destroy the whole town of sleepy hollow
. sure thge headless horseman is an intriguing character
,
but the stoy has so many holes that even he nor depp cant save this disaster
. in the orginal
, the headless horseman was meant to be unstoppable
. no one coudl stop him
, not even ichabod
. by the end of the film
, it had audiences in deep
thought
. burton
however concentrates far too much on the atmosphere
,
and how to make the main characters heroes
. he takes no risk what so ever
,
and this is where he fails
. another pathetic element of the film was the scirpt
. liuke i said earlier
, he just stuffed too much in at one time
, anbd made it look real sloppy
, kind of like the mess the headless horseman made with his victims
. he completely
butchered the story to pieces
. thankfully there are a few factors that i particularly liked
. tje acting by depp was quite notable
. he took the nerdy character of the cartoon
,
and simply acted it out in a better manner
. if it wasn
' t for his quirky one
- liners
, i dout i could have remained awake
, because quite frankly i wass getting sleepy
. just wehn i
thought christina ricci was getting tothe be a good actress
, she winds up doing this
. it just goes to show no actress or actor can pass uv a big blockbuster
. it
' s too tempting tothe let go
, even if the script is mush
. the athmosphere too was quite involving
. i should have jsut gazed at tje sets
,
and the eerie fog
, rether than actually pay attention to what was going onthe
. at least burton
' s films are eye c
andy
, even if they are trash
. teh only real scenes of value weere tje tree full of heads
,
and the fight between thge horseman
, depp
and casper van dien
. other than that
, i wish i could jsut fast foward thru all tghe gaping holes in the film
,
and just sit back
and stare at the scenery
. by the end
, i can only think back
and laugh at how bad sleepy hollow developed
. this is the biggest disappointment of the year
, especially when such a talented director like burton h
andles a project like this
. don
' t waste your time or money
, becasue your head will feel hollow
.
