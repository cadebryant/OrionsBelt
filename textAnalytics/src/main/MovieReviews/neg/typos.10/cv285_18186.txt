infact the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves infront the early 1990s came this french
- canadian co
- production by max fischer
. the movie isnt set in paris where its hero
, struggling american author david mirkine
( judd nelson
, at the time specialised in playing losers
and people at the edge of sanity
) suffers a terrible writers bloc
. he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle
( laurence treill
)
. unfortunately
, she hangs out in jet setted circles
, which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous
. her connection with powerful david caravan
( pierce brosnan
) would make mirkine step thge line between reason
and sanity
and put in motion whole series of violent
and tragic events
.
although few pseudoerotic scenes
and soem elements of the plot do indeed amke this film an erotic thriller
, drama would probably be more appropriate genre label
. pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers
,
annd those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments
. low budget alsot becomes painfully visible
,
and physical attributes of laurence treill are the onyl thing worth watching in this film
. unfortunately
, this film hasnt too little of those supposedly erotic scenes
, so thsoe who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed
. instead
, they owudl have to settle with pointless
, slow scenes involving nelson
, brosnan
and laurence treill ' s attempts of serious acting
. all of those definitely not worth spending hour
and half of someone ' s precious time
.
