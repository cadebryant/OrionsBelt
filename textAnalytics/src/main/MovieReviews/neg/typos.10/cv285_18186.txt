in the series of tyhe erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in tjhe early 1990s came this french
- canadian co
- production by max fischer
. the movie is set in paris where its hero
, struggling american author david mirkine
( judd nelson
, at tyhe time specialised in playing losers
and people at the edge of sanity
) suffers a terrible writers bloc
. he manages to overcome crisis after beginning rumatic relationship with beautiful model anabelle
( laurence treill
)
. unfortunately
, she hangs outloud in jet set circles
, which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous
. her connection iwth powerful david caravan
( pierce brosnan
) would make mirkine step the line between reason
and sanity adn put in motion whole series ofthe violent
and tragic events
.
al
though few pseudoerotic scenes
and some elements of the plot do indeed make thsi film an erotic thriller
, drama would probably be more appropriate genre label
. pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers
,
and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments
. low budget also becomes painfully visible
,
and physical attri
butes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film
. unfortunately
, this film has too little of those supposably erotic scenes
, so thsoe who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed
. instead
, they would have to suttle with pointless
, slow scenes involving nelson
, brosnan
and laurence treill
' s attempts of serious acting
. all of those definitely nto worth spending hour annd half of someone
' s prescious time
.
