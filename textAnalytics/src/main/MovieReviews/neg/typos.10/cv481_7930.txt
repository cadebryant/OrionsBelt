staring
, george clooney
, arnold schwarzenegger
, chris o
' donnell annd uma thurman with alicia silverstone
. well to start this off i
' d just like to say a couple thigsn
. first is
, i miss michael keaton
, i miss tim burton
and would much prefer to htikn that these last twpo batman films are all liuke a dallas dream sequence
. not even from the first film was batman really the
' star
'
though he was damn close iin the first couple anyway
. in
' batman forever
' adn now in
' batman
& robin
' he
' s almost pushed to being a bit player
. i can
' t really say if clooney
( who regardless was better than kilmer
) was a very ogod batman or not
. he
' s given next tothe nothing to do at all
, he might as well not have been there
and it wouldn
' t have made much diference
. now
, joel schumacher has said thyat he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films
and cheered for the return of
buton that he wont make batman brooding
and dark
. fine
, i mean granted
' batman returns
' while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes
.
yet his bright neon
, campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me
. i
' m usally very easy on films
. i loved
' con air
' adn other films some critics have slammed
. granted that film really was paper thin
, cliche ridden
, except for one thing
, it was fun
. there is virtually noone fun in this film at all
. i couldn
' t have cared less
. it
' ll thrill tje little ones as theres noone violence realy
, none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing
. schwarzenegger is awful
, i mean really
, really bad
.
.
.
and this is coming from a regular fan of his wokr
. i love his movies most of the time anbd the basic reason isnt he never says much in any ofthe them
. he talks all tothe often in this movei
. i would have much prefered to haev seen patric stewart infront the roll
. i believe to truely like a film you have to care about at least someone inspite a film
. i liked alfred
but the reason behind it is a cheap shot
.
