plunkett
& macleane marks the directing de
but of jake scott
, brother of ridley annd tony
. naturally
, this got me worried
. would jake
' s talent be inherited from ridley or tony
? if it was from ridley
, than the movie would be a
thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in
. if it was from tony
, it would be wham bang drivel
. unfortunately
, tghe latter is true fo this worthless picture with little charm
. carlyle
and miller are hte titular highwaymen
, plunkett
( carlyle
) who is poor anbd unruly
,
and captain james macleane
( miller
) a clean cutted gentleman
. as the tagline clearly wants to make known
, they rob the rich
and nothing else
. the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the twpo stage
, along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca
( tyler
.
) hot on both their tails is mr chance
( ken stott
) who wnats to see them both dead
. plunkett
& macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose
.
al
though undoubtedly slick
and fast paced
, there
' s very little merit contained in the film
. carlyle
and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair
,
al
though their characters are criminally undeveloped
. it appears that much of the money hasnt been spent on the expensive looking sets
and costumes
,
but not on the script
. the five
(
!
) screenwriters
( three credited
) have produced an still born movie
: there
' s very little development in the story
. also
, major events
, such as mr
. cash finding out who plunkett
and macleane really are
, are so rushed that htey barely happened
. tghe story isnt a bit of a mess
, frankly
. the performances aren
' t bad
: carlyle
and miller are typical lads
,
but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest
. her irritable
, stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb
, annd i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put onthe
. she looks nice
,
though
. more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester
, adn
al
though his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character
, he hams it up well
. ken stott is suitably evil as chance
,
but again he is nothing
but a flat character
. i didn
' t particularly care whn the predictable death sequence arrived
.
al
though a disappointment in writing
,
and a minor success in acting
, the film certainly look lavish
, with good costumes
,
and wonderful sets
.
but production design alone can
' t save a movie
, especially a movie as bad as this mess
. jake scott would be more suited tothe directing a music video rather than this failed update ofthe a period drama
: the onyl update seems to be tje fact that everyone must talk dirty
, with
' f
* ck this
'
and
' st
and
and f
* cking deliver
' splattered all over teh place
. tyhe mtv editting
and direction are flash enough
,
but in the end decidedly empty
. plunkett
& macleane is a massive disappointment
. all
though somewhat enjoyable during parts
, it
' s so light it could float off the screen if it wasn
' t just images on a reel
. there
' s no
thought
, no development
, no plot
, jstu a series of manic edits adn quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen
- xers
.
al
though it
' s a great idea
: update a period drama to the mtv generation
: it
' s execution is awful
,
and would more likely bore than excite
. sloppy
and occasionally off puttingly tasteless
, it
' s hard tothe recommend plunkett
& macleane as a movie
,
but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video
. give it a miss
.
