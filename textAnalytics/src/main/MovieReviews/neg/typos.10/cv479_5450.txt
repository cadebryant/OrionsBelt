i have a great idea for a movie
, one that can ' t miss
. see
, i ' ve got coolio to do a song for thte soundtrack
,
and about fifty athletes
and celebrities to do cameo appearences
. it ' s about professional basketball
, so i ' ll release it right around the nba finals tothe guarantee added publicity
. as for what hte movie is actually about
.
.
. well
, that will all sort itself out eventually
. i figure it will be a comedy
, so i ' ll throw a half
- dozen writers at it
and tkae the best of whatever they come up with
. maybe we ' ll put a gender spin on it
, see if we cxan get some women out to see it
, too
. eddie is one ofthe those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind
. twister
, as inane as the script might have been
, at least required some creative technicians
; mission
: impossible
, overwrought plot
and all
, at least involved genuine affort
. eddie jsut sits there
, hawking up a formula story wihtout any laughs
,
and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is requred
. whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin
, a newyorker york limo driver
and die
- hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team
. coach john bailey
( dennis farina
) hasnt lost control of his overpaid prima donnas
,
and the losses are beginning to mount
. the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess
( frank langella
) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get tothe be an honorary coach of the team
. the winner
( surprise
, surprise
) is eddie
, who becomes a fan favorite
,
and eventually the actual coach
. the knicks continue to lose
,
but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops
. incidentally
, the knicks eventually start winning
. please raise your hand if that comes as a shock
,
and i will invite you to my all
- night marathon of the bad news bears
, major leage
, angels in the outfield
, the mighty ducks
, the big green
, cool runnings
and little giants
. awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds
; it ' s waht they do
. thsoe teams usually involve kids
, for a very sound comedic reason
: it ' s funnier when they screw up
,
adn they ' re more sympathetic
. those which
_ don ' t
_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles
, for another very soudn commedic reason
: they generally have developed some sort of comic timing
. eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it ' s easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players
. this finds nba players liek greg ostertag
, dwayne schintzius
, rick fox
and malik sealy delivering punch lines as
though htey were reading them for the first timne off a bazooka wrapper
(
though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment discribing a black hole to fellow players
)
. perhaps that all didn ' t matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines
,
and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick
. steve rash directs the spiritless script as
though waving a flag of surrender
and screaming
,
" don ' t blame me
, i just work here
.
" prehaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn ' t a movie
-
- it ' s a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once inwhich a hwile
. amonth the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump
, new york mayor rudolph giulianni
, former new york mayor ed koch
, david letterman
, letterman regulars mujibur rahman
anbd sirajul islam
, espn broadcaster chris berman
and knicks announcer marv albert
, as well as dozens of nba players
and several nba arenas
.
and those are the real jokes in eddie
. nothing these individuals say or do is funny
; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice
,
" hey
, it ' s donald trump
!
" or
" hey
, it ' s mujibur
and sirajul
!
" it ' s difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can ' t even get thte cliches in a cliche
- ridden genre script right
. the knicks coach who is eddie ' s antagonist early in the film reappears at the end
,
but he isn ' t given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs
. neither is frank langella
,
and none of the athlete
- actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of
. that leaves her to do her street
- wise miss thang routine
,
but with no character
, noone sharp lines
and no halp
. eddie isn ' t jstu a bad movie with a formulaic premise
. it ' s a movie thyat makes you feel cheated
and offended
, because someone came up with a poster
and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie
,
and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy
.
