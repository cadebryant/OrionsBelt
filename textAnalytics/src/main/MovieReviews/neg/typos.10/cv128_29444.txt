' s review of
" ghosts of mars
"
( sony pictures entertainment
) horror auteur john carpenter
(
" hlloween
,
"
" vampires
"
) strikes out with this sci
- fi eco
- fable that
' s so bad it boggles the mind to imagin how the project ever got green
- lit
. the script by carpenter
and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from lsat year
' s
" pitch black
,
" involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small b
and of humans protect themselves from blood
- thirsty
, marauding aliens
. in the year 2176
, there are 640

" desolation
" williams
- that
' s ice cube
- to bring him bakc to chryse city tothe st
and trial for murder
. bu when they
' re besieged by demented
, zombie

, they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection
. it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave
and
, soon after
, most of the miners went bonkers as long
- dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds
and bodies
, lopping off heads as
" vengeance for anything that tries tothe lay claim to their planet
,
" according to a scientist
( joanna cassidy
)
. carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the
" night of the living dead
"
- like stopry that thge idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing
.
but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed
, allong with the order of their elimination
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 tothe 10
,
" ghosts of mars
" thuds to a laborious

. perhaps
, indeed
, there is a curse onthe mars films
