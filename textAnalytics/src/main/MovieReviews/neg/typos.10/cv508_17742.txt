if the 70
' s nostalgia didn
' t make you feel old
, the 80
' s nostalgia is bound to
. one of the latter set
,
" the wedding singer
,
" seems to be written by someone who did not experience the 1980
' s directly
but only read about them in an article in parade magazine
. the wacky fashions are here
.
.
.
and the music
.
.
.
and references aplenty tothe celebrities
and signs of the times
,
but it all seems tediously
-
and too obviously
- inserted for the didn
' t
- we
- dress
- funny
- back
-
then chuckle
. thte plot is st
andard romantic comedy with nothing original
: robbie
( adam s
andler
) is a wedding singer
; julia
( drew barrymore
) waits tables at weddings
. both are engaged
;
however
, robbie
' s fiance
( angela featherstone
) dumps him at the altar
,
and julia
' s fiance
( matthew glave
) is a skirt
- chasing speculator in junk bonds
. robbie
and julia go through the expected ups
-
and
- downs as htey realize they were meant to be together
. i
' ll fess up
- i
' ve never found adam s
andler funny
. whatever his appeal is
, i
' ve missed it
.
( other comedians i don
' t get include pauly shore
and pee wee herman
- make your own judgments
)
. yhe stupidity
and artificiality of the whole project isnt summarized in a cameo by billy idol as himself
. idol looks liuke hell
,
and the ravages of his lifestyle are barely concealed by thick makeup
. he
' s mocked by a photo of his younger self onthe a rolling stone cover in the same scene
. we
' re not supposed to notice that
,
and we
' re not supposed tothe notice how silly it is that billy idol suddenly appears tothe play fairy godmother to robbie
. otehr cameos
, by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
, provide the only real laughs infront the movie
. lovitz is especially good
, playing a rival wedding singer plotting with the mania of a bond villain tothe take advantage of robbie
