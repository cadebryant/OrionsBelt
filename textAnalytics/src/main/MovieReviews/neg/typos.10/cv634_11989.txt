i didn
' t come into city of angels expecting greatness
. i
' ve never seen wim wenders
' wings ofthe desire
, the classic movie upon which city is loosely based
.
then again
, i have seen enough stries which are based upon a similar plot divice
, with the little mermaid
( both tjhe disney version
and tyhe original folktale
) being among them
, that i had some high expectations about the possible pwoer such a story of impossible lveo can hold
. unfortunately
, city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them
. the plot
, for those that couldn
' t tell from the previews
, revolves around the angel seth
, played with an almsot creepy intensity by nicolas cage
, who
, in the midst of his angelic duties
, falls in love wih a heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally
)
. of course
, his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love exept appearing at r
andom times to talk tothe her
, watch her buy groceries
, only to disappear in the blink of an eye
. their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice
and become human
. using this framework as a jumping
- off point
, the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire
, teh joys ofthe being human
,
and the definition of perfection
. the first half of the movie succeeds on most points
. cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn
' t know feelings so can
' t really express
, preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of entent looks
and hang
- dog expressions
. unfortunately
, cage takes the intensity too far somtimes
, annd
then seth comes across as more creepy tahn sensitive
. as maggie
, ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms withthe her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right
. her beauty
, unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss
, is mature
, intelligent
,
and winning
. likewise
, some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film
. when the camera pans through traffic jams
and libraries adn we get to hear the
thoughts of the r
andom people who flash across the screen
, the audience experiences a little of what it must be like tothe be an angel
. the beautiful camera work
, shooting down onto teh hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches ofthe the angels
, also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel
. the film begins to lose its way
,
though
, when tjhe focus tightens more
and more on seth adn maggie
. the gr
and
, angelic perspective gets lost
, except forthe soem idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel
' s eyes
. the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can
' t feel the world or
, more importantly
, he can
' t feel maggie
: he cant
' t smell her hair
, feel her touch
, or taste the pears she eats
. this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth
' s intense longing
,
but in doign so
, the conflict disappears
. if he whants maggie so badly
,
then why doesn
' t her jsut make the leap
and become human
? after all
, what
' s so great about bieng an angel
? sure
, you get to sit onthe marlboro signs
,
but what
' s that compared to getting to be with meg ryan
?
and from there
, once the yearning has been established
and the romantic denouement must occur
, it
' s all downhill
. the philosophy becomes heavy
- h
anded
, the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deepo
,
and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience
' s hankie
. it
' s the last thirty minutes of the movie
,
then
, that wrecks the film
. i feel like the writer
, by pulling out all yhe melodramatic stops
, has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movei expierence on both the romantic
and the philosophical level
. i came out feeling robbed
, seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing
. i could go on longer
,
but i don
' t want to
" ruin
" the end by revealing any of thte cheap plot devices the film relies on
. city of angels
,
then
, is a paradox
. it
' s a well
- acted
( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type
- casting as a happy
- go
- lucky fallen angel
)
, well
- filmed
,
and based on a wonderful idea
. all these possibilities
,
though
, are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up
.
