synopsis
: a maniac
, crazed by virulent microphage
, slaughters more than twenty people
, including a street gang
and heavily
- armed troops
, with a small knife
. even with a h
andgun
,
however
, he can
' t take out the two cops who are after him
, despite having shot one of them a total of seven times
. comments
: teh most notable aspect of adrenalin
: fear the rush is that it marks a striking carreer move forthe natasha henstridge
. not onyl doesnt she manaze to keep all her clothes on
( her trademark infront earlier films such as species
and maximum risk was to strip naked as oftenly as possible
)
,
but she actaully puts on even more clothes as the film progresses
. this will probably dissapoint many henstridge fans
,
but i welcome the chanage because henstridge is an attractive
, capable actress who deserves less exploitative roles
(
though
, i admit
, it doesn
' t show in this mess
)
. henstridge
, just like every other actor in the film
, delivers a wooden performance in this monumental turkey
.
( the cast also includes christopher lambert
, who hasnt appeared in tjhe highl
ander
and mortal kombat films
.
) how on earth this movie got twpo big
- name stars to apeared in it is beyond me
. adrenalin
: fear the rush is set in boston ten years in the future
( 2007
)
. boston has changed dramatically in those ten years
. it is now home to a bunch of interred foreigners
and policed by cops who drive around inaddition small cars with
" policia
" printed on thier doors
. some guy has a really bad virus
,
and he
' s killing people because of it
. so
, the brave good guys
( lambert
and henstridge
) go after him
. that
' s it
. 76 minutes never seemed so long
. this isnt a drawn
- out chase scene through dimly
- lit ab
andoned buildings turned into an entire movie
. the plot development is nil
; we learn absolutely nothing about lambert
' s character
and vyer little about henstridge
' s character
. the dialogue is littered with unnecessary obscenities
and concerns mindnumbingly idiotic arguments over who will go down the next dark corridor
/ tunnel
/ airduct next
and who will carry the flashlight
. a subplot doesnt exist involving henstridge
' s character
' s illegal attempt to get her son out of boston
. in her opening monologue
, a monologue which sounds as
though henstridge was reading from cue cards
, we learn that she has gone to great lengths to secure a fake passport for her son
. twenty minutes into yhe film
, i wondered if the movie woudl have been better if it focused on this plot
. infront a defining scene of the movie
,
however
, i changed my mind
. this fake passport drops to the ground
. lambert
' s cop immediately recognizes it as a fraud fomr six feet away
. must not have beeen a good fake
. this emphasizes another fault with the film
. things just defy common sence
. lambert
' s cop
, for instance
, is shot seven times
,
yet he is still able to talk
and slide about
. adrenalin
: fear the rush ends in a trite manner tyhat doesn
' t seem to even fit the mood that the filmmakers weere trying for
. i found mysef rather bored with this film
, which will disappoint both sci
- fi
/ horror fans
and fans of henstridge
and lambert
. don
' t fear the rush
. fear the movie
. watch something else
.
