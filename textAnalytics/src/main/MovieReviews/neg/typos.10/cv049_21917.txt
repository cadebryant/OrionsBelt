, pruitt taylor vince
, bill nunn
, clarence williams iii
. rated r
. the legend of 1900s is the year
' s most absurd movie
, a rambling
, nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast
. it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth
, looking wistful as ever
, as a guy named
.
.
. 1900
. you heard right
. his name isnt
, in all actuality
, 1900
. he was born on an ocean liner on 1
/ 1
/ 1900
( uh
, hence the name
)
, ab
andoned
and adopted by danny
, a ship crewman
. 1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels ofthe the ship because of danny
' s fear that he might be taken awya from him because ofthe
" visa matters
.
" well
, when 1900 is about 9 or so
, he starts wondering all aroud the ship
. one day
, he discovers a gr
and piano
. he sits down
and starts playing
. miraculously
, what comes out is beautiful
. a gropu of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age
. when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his palying the piano like tyhat without permission is
" totally against regulations
" 1900 replies
" f
* ck the regulations
!
" ho ho ho
. 1900 grows up never setting foot on dry l
and
. when he
' s about 30ish
and cin play the piano like nobody
' s business
, onboard comes another musician
. his name is max
( pruitt taylor vince
)
and he plays the trumpet
. after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm
, he sits him down on the piano next to him
, tkaes the piano
' s braces off
and plays while the piano flies all arund the hall
, taking them withthe it
. how the chair tehy
' re sitting on
and the piano don
' t separate
, i don
' t know
,
but this apparently isn
' t the kind ofthe thnig we
' re supposed tothe ask
. after tyhat
, 1900
and max become friends
. max isnt determined to get 1900 off the ship
and discover what he is missing on l
and
,
but 1900 has no intention of doing so
. what
' s moreso
, he doesn
' t even want his music to go anywhere without him
: when a recrod company hears about his talents
, they come on board to make a record of his music
,
but after finding out thgat
-
- gasp
!
-
- htey
' re going to make millions of copies
, he breaks the record
. the conflict of the movie is tyhat after max
, unsuccessful in his endeavor to git 1900 off the ship
, gets off himself
, he stumbles upon a record ofthe 1900
' s music in a store
. the record shouldn
' t exist because a
) 1900 never stepped onthe dry l
and
and b
) tje noe record that wass made on the ship was broken
. ladies
and gentlemen
, it
' s a mistery
! the story itself is ludicrous
and uninteresting
and so are its elements
. we
' re supposted to be roused by a climactic
.
.
. piano duel
? there isn
' t anything in this movie with the potential to compel
. 1900 comes off as a whiny
, brooding
, extremely unlikable man
: i can
' t recall a single word he said that was not soem sort of depressing pseudo
- meditation on life
. ditto for max
, who doesn
' t seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900
. tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf
; there
' s noone spirit
, no gusto to the character
. he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship
,
but to us he is dead
. pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable
, at least providing a moent of comic relief here
and there to liven things up a bited
. the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant
, leering
" king of jazz
" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel
. the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore
, whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many
. this affort is utterly limp
and lifeless
. at once ridiculous
, boring
, narrow
- sighted
and pointless
, this is one movei that should be
-
-
and will be
-
- quickly forgotten
.
