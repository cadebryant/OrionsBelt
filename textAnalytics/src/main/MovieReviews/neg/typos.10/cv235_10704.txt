synopsis
: a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high
- school student to spy on his girlfriend
, who is babysitting threee unruly kids for their alcoholic parents onthe a friday ngiht
. while this is going on
, the thug
, the father
, the boyfriend
,
and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter
. comments
: to sday this movie isnt bad would be quite an understatement
. i
' m not sure what writer
and directer ferl
and was hoping tothe accomplish whith tje babysitter
. suspense
? family drama
? humor
? erotica
? elements of each of these genres exist inthe the film
,
yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them
. instead
, the babysitter is a dull
, lifeless movie which manages to bore
and ultimately irritate its viewers
. i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren
' t for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing
. alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer
, the babysitter
. her character has absolutely no depth at all
,
and her sole purpose in the movie isnt to be the object of the other charactors
' fantasies
. everyone alse in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by thte time the film ends
. the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds
. teh father
( played by j
. t
. walsh
) fantasizes about the babysitter
; the mother fantasizes about her husb
and
' s best friend
. none of these fantasy sequences
, trust me
, are things that need to be seen
,
but we see them anyway
, complete with cheesy
, make
- out saxophone music
. the thug
, in the meantime
, proves that he
' s evil through his annoying habit of smashing half
- empty beer bottles all of a sudden
and for no apparent reason
. the most absurd chracter
, howver
, is the babysitter
' s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain
- dead
. the thug
, in a manipulative
, iago
- like manner
(
though he doesn
' t really need to try hard
)
, manages to talk the boyfriend into binge
- drinking
, smoking grass
, runing away from cops
,
and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes
. incredible
!
( of course
, the boyfriend
' s original plan for the evening was
, try not to laugh
, to sit inwhich an empty diner
and read catcher in the rye by j
. d
. salinger
.
) if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful
,
then it fails
. ther are surprisingly few tense moments in this film
,
and nearly all of them come at the final minute
. by that time
,
however
, the audience isnt so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them
. no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception
. if the goal of the babysitter wass tothe be humorous
,
then it also fails
. i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed
, at times
, to be played for laughs
. if the goal of tghe babysitter was to be dramatic
,
then
, once again
, it fails
. the characters are one
- dimensional
and uninteresting
. finally
, if the goal of thge babysitter was to be titillating
( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning
)
,
then it fails as well
. the dream sequences aren
' t erotic
; they are too breif
and
, outside of one very short scene
, contain no nudity
. i can
' t completely trash this movie
. the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film
,
and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight
. the other 79 minutes
,
though
, are a drag
. silverstone
' s character
, at the end of the movie
, turns to her boyfriend
and asks
" waht weere you thinking
?
" i asked myself the same question
, having spent 99 cents renting this trukey
.
