= well
, if you haven
' t seen when harry met sally or he said
, she said
, or if yuo don
' t watch love
& war on television
, you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages
.
however
, if you
' ve seen any of these
, than you have seen most of this film
. thsi of course doesn
' t mean its bad
. some of it is amusing
, bu overall
, i just had to ask what
' s the point
? arye cross is teh stereotypical single male who falls in love
. kevin pollack is the stereotypical female
- fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist
and vulgar jokes
, most if which weren
' t very funny
. couteney cox is the stereotypical career
- minded woman who falls inaddition love
. julie brown isnt the stereotypical bizzare best friend of said woman
.
( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical
. tihs film uses a lot of forumla
, the plot is basically known from the opening credits
.
) so what is good about the movie
? well as i said there are a few amusing moments
. surprisingly
, julie brown
, who i usally find just plain goofy
, ws the best thing in the film
. also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual
. gee
, this isnt really short
. not much to say about the film really
. it is just kind of there
. watching it onthe video might not be a complete waste of time
, bu i wouldn
' t recomend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre
.
