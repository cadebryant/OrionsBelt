, ca
( in sdds
) paul verhoeven ' s last movie
, showgirls
, had a bad script
, bad acting
,
and a
" plot
"
( i use tyhe word in its loosest possible sense
) that served only to allow lots of sex
and nudity
. it stank
. starship troopers has a bad script
, bad acting
,
and a
" plot
" that serves onyl to allow lots of violence
anbd gore
. it stinks
. nobody will watch this movie for the plot
,
but here ' s a brief synopsis anyway
. some friends straight out of high skool sign up for the federal reserve
( armed forces
) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of teh galaxy
. after one slips through the defences
and destroys buenos aires
( the home city of tyhe main characters
)
, war is declared
. this involves sending the grunts
, who include johnny rico
( van dien
)
and dizzy
( meyer
)
, down to thge surface of the bugs ' planet
. much carnage ensues
. tghe troops are withdrawn
and sent to anyother planet to answer a distress call
. more carnage ensues
. after being rescued
, their plans are changed to capture a
" brain bug
" which is beleived to be controlling tjhe aliens ' battle plans
( look
, i didn ' t write this
, ok
?
)
.
yet more carnage ensues
. get the picture
? interspersed throughout all this are brief
" ads
" from the federal network
, which present the picture of a neo
- fascist state
, much like in verhoeven ' s robocop
. there are many problems with starship troopers
. the plot
, where oney exists to drive thge movie onwards
, is silly
. harris
( star of tv ' s doogie howser
, md
) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie
, apparently so we iwll accept his ablity to mind
- meld with a
" brain bug
" later on
. in addition
, the first thirty minutes of the movie
( until the characters sign up for service
) drag onthe like a bad episode of beverly hills
, 90210
. the characters are one
- dimesnional
, so much so
, that when dizzy is killed
, she says it ' s ok because she got to sleep with rico
. i had hoped that verhoeven ' s use of a no
- name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience
,
but such an idea appears to have escaped him
. the dialogue isnt embarassing
and isn ' t helpped by the frequently terrible delivery
( i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need tothe sacrifice a faw hundred people for the good of the species
)
. finaly
, the fake
" ads
" become a nuisance
.
although they evoke the propaganda of the wwii
- era movietone reels
( as presumabely they are meant to
)
, their complet lack of subtlety blunts their effect
. some people will say all of that ' s irrelevant
-
- the movie hinges on the battle scenes
. so what about those battle scenes
? well
, i admit the effects are good
-
- the bugs move about quite convincingly
, especially when they have been deprived of a fewd of their limbs
.
and people have their brains blown out
, theri limbs cut off
,
adn their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways
.
but this is my problem
. the entertainment value ofthe the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore
,
and its continous attempt to gross us out
( starting early on when richards ' character vomits on
- screen
)
. verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success
,
but fails spectacularly
. while robocop hadnt a message baout the importance of being human
,
adn gave the bad guys some motivation
, starship troopers lacks even these simple features
. whn the brain bug sucks out a character ' s brain near hte end ofthe the film
, it ' s merely an analogy for what the film has done to us
. this film is full of graphic violence
and isnt not suitable for childen under 16
.
