( in sdds
) paul verhoeven
' s last movie
, showgirls
, had a bad script
, bad acting
,
and a
" plot
"
( i use the word in its loosest possible sense
) that served only to allow lots of sex
and nudity
. it stank
. starship troopers has a bad script
, bad acting
,
and a
" plot
" that serves only to allow lots of violence
and gore
. it stinks
. nobody will watch this movie fo the plot
,
but here
' s a brief synopsis anyway
. some friends straight out of high school sign uv for the federal reserve
( armed forces
) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from tghe other side ofthe the galaxy
. after one slips through the defences anbd destroys buenos aires
( the home city of thge main cahracters
)
, war is declared
. this involves sending the grunts
, who inlcude johnny rico
( van dien
)
and dizzy
( meyer
)
, down to the surface ofthe the bugs
' planet
. much carnage ensues
. the troops are withdrawn annd sent to another planet to answer a distress call
. more carnage ensues
. after being rescued
, their plans are changed to capture a
" brain bug
" which is beleived to be controlling the aliens
' battle plans
( look
, i didn
' t write this
, ok
?
)
.
yet more carnage ensues
. get the picture
? interspersed throughout all this are brief
" ads
" fomr the federal network
, which present the picture of a neo
- fascist state
, much like in verhoeven
' s robocop
. there are many problems with starship troopers
. the plot
, where one exists to drive the movie onwards
, is silly
. harris
( star of tv
' s doogie howser
, md
) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on infact the movie
, apparently so we will accept his ability to mind
- meld with a
" brain bug
" later on
. in addition
, the first thirty minutes of the movie
( until the characters sign up for sevice
) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills
, 90210
. the characters are one
- dimensional
, so much so
, that when dizzy is killed
, she says it
' s ok because she got to sleep with rico
. i hadnt hoped that verhoeven
' s use of a no
- name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audeince
,
but such an idea appears tothe have escaped him
. the dialogue is embarassing
and isn
' t helped by the frequently terrible delivery
( i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species
)
. finally
, the fake
" ads
" become a nuisance
.
al
though they evoke the propag
anda of the wwii
- era movietone reels
( as presumably they are meant to
)
, their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect
. some people will say all of that
' s irrelevent
-
- the movie hinges onthe the battle scenes
. so what about thsoe battle scenes
? well
, i admit the effects are good
-
- the bugs move about quite convincingly
, especially when they have been deprived of a few of thier limbs
.
and people have thier brains blown out
, their limbs cut off
,
and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways
.
but this is my problem
. the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore
,
and its continous attempt to gross us out
( starting early on when richards
' character vomits on
- screen
)
. verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success
,
but fails spectacularly
. while robocop had a message about the importance of being human
,
and gave the bad guys some motivation
, starship troopers lacks even these simple features
. wehn the brain bug sucks out a character
' s brain near the end of the film
, it
' s merely an analogy for what the film has done to us
. this film is full of graphic violence
and is nto suitable for children under 16
.
