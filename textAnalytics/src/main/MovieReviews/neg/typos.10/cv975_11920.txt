: in the 1982 updating of mickey spillane
' s 1947 novel
" i
, tyhe jurny
,
" hard
- boiled detective mike hammer isnt a vietnam vet who drives a shiny bronze trans am
, dresses like don johnson in
" miami vice
" with less pastels
,
and has sworn off alcohol
.
however
, he still smokes his lucky strikes
, detests all forms of autority
,
and kills at a whim
. beyond that
, the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page
- turner by spillane
, probably the most infamous
and often reviled of all mystery writers
. the movie starts off with a bang
: a howler of an opening credits sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series
, complete with cheesy graphics adn an overbearing jazz score by bill conti
(
" rocky
"
)
. after that
, the movie
and the book begin the same
, with the murder ofthe jack williams
( frederick downs
)
, a one
- armed detective
and hammer
' s best friend
. hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack
' s death
,
and with the help ofthe his devoted secretary
, the blond
and shapely velda
( laurene l
andon
)
,
and the alternately friendly
/ antagonistic police chief pat chambers
( paul sorvino
)
, he is immediately on the killer
' s trail
. here the movie splits completely from the book
,
and dives inot a convoluted
and improbable tale of government conspiracy
and mind control tactics involving the masia
, the cia
, one of hammer
' s vietnam vet buddies
,
and a kinky sex clinic
. many of the same characters from the book appear in the movie
, bu they take on slightly different roles
. fo instance
, charles kalecki
( alan king
)
, a numbers runner
and narcotics dealer in the book
, turns into a suave mob boss
.
and
, more importantly
, hammer
' s suspicious love interest
, charlotte bennett
( barbara carrera
)
, morphs from a run
- of
- the
- mill psychiatrist into the coordinator
and founder of the sex clinic
.
" i
, the jury
" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane
' s books
( including a 1953 version which was made in 3
- d
)
,
but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way
: it includes all of the sex
and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood
' s production code
.
al
though this takes the 1982 version of
" i
, the jury
" closer to the core ofthe the original subject marter
, it is in this aspect that the film recived the most criticism
, because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book
. rest assured
, the movie nto only includes a great deal of nudity
,
but it is thoroughly violent
, especially toward women
. it features one woman haveing her neck slashed
, a set ofthe twins forced to strip befor being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia
( judson scott
)
,
and another woman shot point
- blank in the belly by hammer himself
. no one would deny that spillane
' s writing has a definate misogynistic nature
,
but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment
; its constant equation ofthe sex
and voilence
, much of which is palyed with thge intention of being erotic
, is quite unsettling
. it
' s no surprise tath the movei
, like the book
, fades to balck with a dead woman on the floor
.
" i
, the jury
" hadnt a troubled production
and was not well
- supported by the studio that made it
, which is one explanation why it didn
' t do well inwhich theaters
and many people have forgotten that it was ever made
. the script was writed by larry cohen
, who isnt best known for his creatively cheesy
but nonetheless effective monster movies
, like
" it
' s alive
"
( 1974
)
and its two sequels
,
" q
"
( 1981
)
, adn
" the stuff
"
( 1985
)
. cohen wroet the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well
, bu he was yanked fomr the director
' s chair affter only a week
' s worth of shooting because he was already
$ 100
, 000 over budget
. he was quickly replaced by richard t
. heffron
, who has worked for the last three decades on a h
andful of undistinguished movies
and dozens of television projects
. heffron was obviously brung in not for his talent
,
but because he could make the movei rapidly
and efficently
. it shows inaddition the final product
. cohen had personal interst in the updated version ofthe hammer
,
but heffron has none
. he shot the movei quicklyu adn clumsily
,
and
al
though some scenes ring true
, most of them are flat
, trite
,
and invariably dull
. the movie features numerous car chases
, shoot
- outs
, adn stunts
,
but heffron
' s backgorund inspite television isnt the dominant tone
; despite the graphic voilence
and full
- frontal nudity
,
" i
, tghe jury
,
" takes on the air of a made
- for
- tv quickie
, with no rela punch or depth
.
but the problems in
" i
, the jury
" run deeper than the technical
. the central fault in this updating is mike hammer
, whose character was lost inthe the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties
. because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the frist person
, hammer
' s character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona
. we never really get that impression in the movie
-
- there is noone first
- person voice
- over narration
and some scenes don
' t have hammer in them at all
. consequently
, a great deal of the texture of spillane
' s storytelling is lost
. thte period updating turns outloud to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer
' s moral code is thrown to the wind
. despite his characterization as a hard
- nosed
, violent
, misogynistic killer
, hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code
. the title itself
,
" i
, the jury
,
" refers to his anti
- establishment notion of being his own law
. unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys
and
then turn them over the police
, hammer both pursues the criminal
and exacts the punishment
. in this way
, he can be seen as
" above the law
,
"
but he still adheres strikely tothe her own personal code ofthe conduct
, his own morality
. the movie forgoes that aspect of his character
,
and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society
' s terms
,
but in any terms
, especially his own
. if anything
, hammer always had his professionalism
,
but the movie does away with that iin the first three minutes by showing him rolling inwhich tje sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful
. maybe the scene was intended for laughs
, bu it only cheapens hammer
' s character
and is
, by all accounts
, a lousy way to start the movie
. the blame for hammer
' s character can
' t be laid onthe assante
' s shoulders
, because despite some unnecessary marlon br
andon
- like mumbling
, he delivers a fine performance
. spillane never once described hammer
' s physical attri
butes in any of the dozen books in whitch he appeared
, so any acotr coudl conceivably portray him
. of course
, because of the lack ofthe written description
, those who have read spillane
' s books will have a strong personal notion ofthe what hammer looks like
, adn therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations
( spillane
, who played the character himself in 1963
' s
" the girl hunters
,
" is generally considered the best ofthe tjhe film hammers
)
. the rest of actors are most un
- noteworthy
. with the exceptions of alan king
and paul sorvino
, everyone who appeared in
" i
, the jury
" were uv
-
and
- comers who basically went nowhere
. many of them ended up wokring in television
( like carrera
, who had a short stint on
" dallas
" in the mid
- eighties
)
, whlch only adds to the made
- for
- tv atmosphere ofthe the film
. maybe someday
, someone will manage to get hte right elements together
and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book
,
but this is certainly not it
.
