the main problem withthe martin lawrence
' s pet project
, a thin line between love annd hate
, like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man
, is that his character is an irresponsible jerk
,
and if that is the case
, it doesn
' t seem to do anything except justify thge woman
' s actions
. that is especially the case in lawrence
' s darnell wright
. he is one of those macho guys with womens lined up a mile long
. now don
' t think i condone this just because i
' m male
. my philosophy is
, if you are one ofthe the few heterosexual males lucky enough to git your h
ands on a beautiful
, kind girl
, yuo should treat her like a princess
and respect her
. darnell doesn
' t think like this
. he sleeps with these girls once
and dumps them
.
and by the period in thge film he dicovered that his newest target
, beautiful
, wealthy br
andi web
( plyed nicely by whitfield
) who runs a successful real estate business
, is outloud to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia
( king
)
, i found myself thinking
,
" i
' m supposed to efel sorry for this guy
?
" after all
, it is largely darnell
' s fault
. if he is lining up all these women
, yuo
' d think he
' d have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day
, as his mother says it does
. bu he doesn
' t
, so yuo get the sense that he
' s not only irresponsible
,
but also pretty dumb
. you especialy get this sense that he
' s dumb after br
andi tells him she killed her husb
and for allegedly abusing her
.
( i
' d put my pants on in two seconds after that
!
) now
, br
andi is a psycho bitch
,
but it
' s hard nto to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage
. one final flaw
,
though
, is letting br
andi fall for darnell tothe begin with
. br
andi is a classy
, intelligent woman with an mba fomr harvard
, who initally resists darnell
' s
" immature play
" as she calls it
, as any woman like her owudl iin real life
.
but all ofthe a sudden she says yes
.
but when you listen to darnell
' s four letter word vocabulary watch his actions
, you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell perido
, much less hvae such an unhealthy obsession for him
! lawrence cxan be good when he wants to
, bu in order to prove it
, he needs to let other people write
and direct his movies
. look at this movie
. four writers
, as a result it
' s too long
( two hours
, when it could
' ve easily worked at ninety mintues
!
)
and it has a lot of subplots
and characters that appear
and disappear as quickly as they came
( which makes me think the writers didn
' t get allong
)
, all of which isn
' t necessary
. there are some bright spots
,
though
. whitfield
, regina king
, della reese
,
and bobby brown all do what they cant with lazily written parts
,
and they help it out a lot
.
and there are some funny parts
( like
, for example
, the scene where reese attemts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son
and damaging her property
)
,
but they
' re just not enough to sustain the film
.
