: john the baptist is sent from heaven to see is the world is worth saving
. he must find some sign of hope in teh people of newfoundland
. this is little more than a tv skit in movie form
. it is watchable
and apparently will be released to theaters in canada
,
but it is unlikely to be seen on the international market
. it is diverting
but hardly a serious piece of cinema
