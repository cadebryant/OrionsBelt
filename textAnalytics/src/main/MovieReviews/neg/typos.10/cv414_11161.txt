- released krippendorf
' s tribe is bieng marketed as a family comedy
, bu buyer beware
. this movie can
' t make up its mind
. is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male
and female bodies
, menstruation
, circumcision
,
and sex that would make any parents squirl at the
thought of having their child next to them
? or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort
? either way
,
" unbalanced
" is the word to stamp onthe this hitted
and miss
and miss
and miss effort
. the premise is catchy
- widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf
( richard dreyfuss
) has spent the past two years
" getting over
" tjhe death of his wife
, neglecting key research
and squ
andering grant money on personal living expenses
. now it
' s time to show what he
' s acheived inspite those two years
,
and he has absolutely nothing to show for it
. with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea
, krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that tyhe previous
$ 100
, 000 grant was spended on trips to mcdonald
' s
.
but when his
" discovery
" becomes the latest craze among colleagues
, the profesor finds he must do more than talk about tjhe tribe
- he must create it
. with hte aid of his three children
, the headstrong teen shelly
( natasha lyonne of everyone syas i love you
)
, the slightly younger mickey
( gregory smith
)
,
and the nine
- year
- old edmund
( carl michael lindner
)
, the
" shelmikedmu
" tribe
( named from the first half of each child
' s name
) is born
,
and videos quickly produced in krippendorf
' s backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe
. despite the professor
' s wishes
, the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows
, due in greatest part to veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
, an overly vivacious
(
and voluptuous
) anthropologist who barges her way into the dicovery
and basicaly deems herself krippendorf
' s main assistant
. hungry for recognition
, micelli sets up interviews
, lectures
, etc
. in an effort tothe make this tghe biggest sociological event in history
, a sure fire way to go down in the hitory books
. krippendorf
, on the other h
and
, is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor
, not in history books
, adn with each new lecture
, he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe
- mating habits
, domestic structure
, etc
. thru fumbling improvision
,
and often some quick thinking from his oldest son
, krippendorf makes it thru each newyorker lecture
,
but only creates omre anbd more interst in the highly unique tribe
. onthe the opposing end is krippendorf
' s arch rival
, ruth allen
( lily tomlin
)
, an arrogant professor whose jalusey drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non
- existent tribe
. it
' s a cute idea
,
and approached with a more subtle
(
and mature
) sytle
, krippendorf
' s tribe could
' ve been a real winner
. sadly
, the mostly
- misfired toilet humor
, overly comical musical score
( by bruce broughton
)
,
and sugar coated sentiments
( all the key ingredients of a
" family comedy
"
) jsut aren
' t the right tone for this film
. cut that crap outloud
, add some razor sharp dialogue adn witty sociological perceptions
and yuo
' ve got a good start
. at the state it
' s in now
, you
' ve got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs
. doubtfire meets dumb
& dumber
,
and that
' s not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try
. the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of
" average
"
, with a few laugh
- out
- loud moments
and a great big gap in between them
. most of the characters are surprisingly two
- dimensional
,
and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting efort
( lyonne
) seems to go greatly unappreciated
. director todd holl
and has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways
. it
' s stuck in limbo between disney family fare
( jungle 2 jungle
)
and potentially hilarious adult comedy
( a fish called w
anda
)
. it
' s this unbalanced structer that really knocks it down a grade
,
and it
' s a brutal drop
. a strong warning to parents
: forget the impression given by advertisements
, do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she
' s holding his penis
? yes
, it
' s put thta bluntly
! just be warned
- this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film
,
and others might not be as tame
.
