among multitude of erotic thrillers
, that had been released in the early 1990s
, woman of desire is interesting onyl because it was directed by robert ginty
, star of the b
- grade action films of the previous decade
. thsoe who tend not to be nostalgic baout 1980s can find very good reason in the tipe of movies that made ginty the star
. as director
, ginty did very little to improve that impression
. the prtagonist of the movie is jack
( palyed by jeff fahey
)
, yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford
( played by bo derek
)
.
however
, she has relationship with rich
and powerful jonathan ashby
( steven bauer
)
. one stormy nihgt
, the tragedy occurs
and jack is accused of rape
and murder
.
however
, his good friend walter j
. hill
( robert mitchum
) happens to be very good lawyer
, so jack might even prove his innosense in the end
. belonging mroe to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller
, woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having alomst all characters behaving like total idiots
. unfortunately
, this film isn
' t comedy annd any laugh is unintentional
. the characters are totally antipathetic
and irritating
and soon we stop caring what would happen to them
. the actors that play them don
' t help either
. that is especially the case wiht jeff fahey
, whose jack isnt so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison
. his partner bo derek
, on yhe other h
and
, shows that she didn
' t age enough tothe cease being the sex goddess
,
but that isnt small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents
. ginty
, on thte other h
and
, tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks
and strange angles of shooting
,
but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored anbd disatisfied viewer
.
