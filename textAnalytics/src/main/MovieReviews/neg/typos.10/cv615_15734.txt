i ' m going to start this review off wtih a hypothetical question
. let ' s say ytou ' ve just been in a car accident
,
and the driver of the otehr vehicle is unconscious
. your friends have left to go get halp
,
and ytou ' re waiting to see if the victim wakes up
. a tow
- truck comes along
,
and the driver hops out of the truck to see what ' s going on
. he
then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck
. do you
: a
) run away screaming for your life
, staying away from tjhe main road
, b
) run away
(
but not too fast
)
and stay on the main road even when the madman infact teh truck starts following you
,
* stop
* to catch your breath
, try to negotiate with the psycho
,
anbd when that fails
, start running away again
, all the while
* staying on the main road
*
? if you answered
" a
"
, you are far more intelligent than tghe screenwriter of
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the next generation
"
and will likely hate this movie
.
however
, if you anwsered
" b
"
, prepair to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind
!
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the next generation
" is being called a sequel
,
but it ' s really more of a remake of the original
. there ' s a few changes here
and there
,
but it ' s essentially thge same
( even the infamous
" meathook
" scene has been re
- created
.
) the storey opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night ofthe their prom
,
and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere
. needless to say
, they soon encounter leatherface
and his nutty familiy
. much carnage ensues
. to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly
. in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question
, there is a moent towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere
. it jsut swoops down
and kills him with its wheel
. no explantion is given as tothe who was flying it or why he
/ she is going aroud killing people whith the planes wheel
. the dialogue is even more atrocious
. zellwegger
, who is kidnapped by
" the family
" early on
, keeps trying to hvae normal conversations with these people
. when you ' re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws
and dead corpses
, i would think that rationality would go outloud the window
. speaking of going out the window
, there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window
. apparently
, the stunt double had a little trouble
, because she visibly gets sticked in the window
. hte director quickly cuts to a wide shooted where the stunt double
* doesn ' t
* get caught in the window
. this ws one ofthe many glaring inconsistencies
. there are so many
, infact fact
, that if i weere tothe name them all
, this review would be several pages long
. the onyl reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey
. he plays a member of
" the family
" with a hydraulic leg
( home
- made
, i might add
)
and is so completely over
- the
- top
, ytou can ' t help
bu be amazed by his performance
. he obviously had a lot of fun with this part
,
and it really shows
. he makes jack nicholson ' s portrayal of thge psychotic inn keeper in
" the shining
" look restrained in comparison
. for a horror movie
,
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the next generation
" contains surprisingly littel gore
. in fact
, in contains none
. there ' s a littel blood here
and there
,
but that ' s as far as it goes
. which leads me to believe taht the budget must have been
* astonishingly
* low
,
and it shows
. everything about yhe movie looks cheap
, from the sets to tghe costumes
. especially leatherface
. once frightening
and nightmare inducing
, he ' s nowe as terrifying as dame edna
. do yourself a favor
and take a pass at this remake
. check out the far superior original instead
.
