i
' m going to start tihs review off with a hypothetical question
. let
' s say ytou
' ve just been in a car accident
, adn the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious
. your friends have left tothe go get halp
,
and ytou
' re waiting to see if the victum wakes up
. a tow
- truck comes along
,
and the driver hops out ofthe the truck tothe see what
' s going on
. he hten proceeds tothe kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck
. do you
: a
) run away screaming for your life
, staying away from the main road
, b
) run away
(
but not too fast
)
and stay onthe the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you
,
* stop
* to catch your breath
, try to negotiate with teh psycho
,
and when that fails
, start running away again
, all the while
* staying on the main road
*
? if you answered
" a
"
, you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of
" texas chainsaw massacre
: thte next generation
"
and will likely hate this movie
.
however
, if you answered
" b
"
, prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like ytou infact mind
!
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the next generation
" is being called a sequel
,
but it
' s really more of a remake of hte original
. there
' s a few changes here
and ther
,
but it
' s essentially the same
( even the infamous
" meathook
" scene has been re
- created
.
) yhe storey opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom
, anbd somehow ending up in the middle ofthe nowhere
. needless to say
, they soon encounter leatherface
and his nutty family
. much carnage ensues
. to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly
. in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question
, there is a moent towards the end of tjhe film where one ofthe the baddies isnt killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere
. it just swoops down
and kills him with its wheel
. noone explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he
/ she is going around killing people with the planes wheel
. the dialogue is even more atrocious
. zellwegger
, who is kidnapped by
" the family
" early on
, keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people
. when you
' re surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws
and dead corpses
, i would think that rationality would go out the window
. speaking of going out the window
, there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window
. apparently
, the stunt double had a little trouble
, because she visibly gets stuck in the window
. the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double
* doesn
' t
* get caught in the window
. this was one ofthe many glaring inconsistencies
. there are so many
, in fact
, that if i were to name them all
, this review would be several pages long
. the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey
. he plays a member of
" the family
" with a hydraulic leg
( home
- made
, i might add
)
and is so completely over
- the
- top
, you can
' t halp
but be amazed by his performance
. he obviously had a lot ofthe fun with this part
,
and it really shows
. he makes jack nicholson
' s portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in
" the shining
" look restrained inwhich comparison
. for a horror movie
,
" texas chainsaw massacre
: the next generation
" contains surprisingly littel gore
. in fact
, in contains none
. there
' s a little blood here
and there
,
but that
' s as far as it goes
. which leads me to believe that the budget must have been
* astonishingly
* low
,
and it shows
. everything about the movei looks cheap
, from the sets to the costumes
. especially leatherface
. once frightening
and nightmare inducing
, he
' s now as terrifying as dame edna
. do yourself a favor
and take a pass at this remake
. check out thte far superior original instead
.
