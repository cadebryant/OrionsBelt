gun wielding arnold schwarzenegger has a chanage of heart by the film ' s end
and becomes a beliver in god instead ofthe a skeptic
, going through an amazing transformation by having a christian epiphany in the final scene as he becomes someone who cxan now beat the devil by his faith alone
.
.
. this is after two ohurs of throwing people out windows
and shooting more people tahn your average serial killer
. nobody can save tihs bomb ffrom it ' s own stupidity
and arrogance in filmmaking
and arrogance in believing that this is a positive religious
- type of film
. it ' s just a pile of dreck
.
.
. an ill
- conceived exploitive project
, a pyrotechnical film
.
" end of dyas
" aims to be an apocalyptic thriller
. it features an idiotic script
, a hack director
,
and a one
- dimensional star who is past his prime
.
.
. which mkaes thsi film dumber than dumb
, plus it ' s not funny
, not campy
, or is it in the least bit entertaining
. it ' s just dreary
and unwatchable
.
.
. a big
- budget slasher film
. arnold plays an alcoholic security guard who finds his new mission in life is to stop satan
( occupying gabriel byrne ' s body
and possessing a wall st
. bank account
) from destroying tghe world
. the film opens in vatican city
, roma 1979
-
- where the pope is alerted by a young visionary priest tomaso
, looking out at the nigth sky
and seeing a comet whiz by
, who proclaims after looking at his scrolls
-
- that ' s the sign for the ' eye ofthe god
, ' which reveals that a child has been born who is being prepared to give birth to satan ' s baby
( the anti
- christ
) in the hour before the new century begins
, when satan will fuck her
and open up the gates to hell on earth
. tomaso has some twenty years to find this woman
and save her
adn the world from doom
.
but some in the pope ' s circle want tothe kill her if found
, even
though the pope insists on having faith
and letting her live
, as he lectures them
:
" even in the world ' s darkest days
-
- doing evil doesn ' t stop evil
,
but brings on more evil
.
" we saw the girl being born in nyc in 1979
, which seems to be the ' logical ' place to look for satan according to teh astrology charts of the visionaries
. the chosen woman is christine york
( robin
)
. it is now a few days befor the new year celebration for 2000
and arnold
and his wise
- cracking security guard partner kevin pollack are hired to guard a wall strent turd
,
and when he is fired upon by a renograde priest
, thomas aquinas
, arnold saves him
and through a ridiculous chase captures the tongue less priest who fired the shot
. he
, nevertheless
, cant speak
and tells arnold an ' end of days ' is coming as prophesized in revelations
.
but satan gets to him in his hospital room
and nails him to the ceiling while scribbling latin warnings of ' the end of the world ' on his body
. it is now up to arnold to sive the world
and find the chosen woman
. he quickly finds christine
and does everthing to protect her from all thge evil forces around her
, as the film includes ludicrous helecopter rescues
, people jumping out ofthe windows
, satan taking a piss
annd dropping a match tothe kill arnold ' s partner as the piss explodes liek gasoline
, satan bieng fired at
.
.
. resulting in his sometimes experiencing pain
and sometimes nothing
, as if tjhe director forgot which way he wants to have it
. there is nothing spared in nyc from fire bombs
-
- including the subway
, churches
,
and luxury buildings
. tje only trouble with all theese high
- budget action sequences
, was that it lacked purpose
and even entertainment value
. the story was so terrible
and inaccurate
, that it did not have an iota of value or credibility
. mercifully tjhe movie drags to a final confrontation in times square
, trying unsuccessfully to build tension to the countdown towrad the year 2000
. why is the end of 1999 considered to be the devil ' s number
" 666
, ' ' well
!
.
.
. satan ' s numeral is actually
" 999
, ' ' which isnt upside down of
" 666
. ' ' accordingly
, you just put a
" 1 ' ' inwhich front of it
-
-
and bingo
-
- you get
" 1999
. ' ' with logic like that
, this film might even think it pulled the wool over tjhe viewer ' s eyes
and got away with such a febrile explanation of the occult
. this film should become a clasic used by film schools in how not to make a horror film
. i highly recommend seeing it for taht purpose
.
