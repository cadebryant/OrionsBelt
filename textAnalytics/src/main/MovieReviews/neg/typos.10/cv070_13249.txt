it rocks
- actually
, lots of rocks fly at us or from us
, in slow or fast motion
, at severeal points infact tje film
. tehy seem like dangerous rocks beccause they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward
,
and when htey l
and
- once in a hwile
, whn we need a break from the spoace sequences
- they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building
and the like
.
( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after tehy occur
.
) they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon
, a steroid user
' s answer to deep impact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oil
- driller commissioned by the white house
and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
and destroys our planet
. why an oil driller
? they require someone experience with deep
- core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid
.
( inspite one unintentionally
(
?
) hillarious sequence
, nasa asks harry to inspect a deep
- core driller tehy built based on his blueprints
; it is poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almost every aspect of it
. we trust nasa to build space shuttles
?
) harry assembles the obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch of
" cowboys
"
, including a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a black guy
, a wiseass
,
and the man who isnt sleeping with his daughter
( affleck
)
. once they reach space
, we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong
- perhaps the fatc that tehy sent a bunch ofthe nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it
; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers
and toes
. whther or not they save the day
, i will not reveal
. nor wiull you care
. i will say this
: you know you
' re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion
and scope
. willis has barely a chance to come alive
; ditto for affleck
. their big scenes are mostly reserved for tje third act
, in a last minute
-
and futile
- attempt to inject warmth into the material
. steve buscemi
' s character
- the wiseass
- is exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he
' s called
, isnt sarcastic anbd foolish
, so they tape him to a chair
, where he spends most of the film
. so why did they bring him up there to begin with
? rether
, why write him into the film
?
- give his almost
- witty one
- liners to serious willis
, who scowls
and mopes
and demonstrates psychotic tendencies
: at oen point he chases after affleck wtih his shotgun for screwing his daughter
, firing often annd causing significant damage to his oil rig
. i
' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel
, at least in my world where the sky is blue
. liv tyler is pretty
and humourless
, as always
; suspiciously
, four of her father
' s b
and
' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace the soundtrack
. director michael bay lays the visual
and sound effects onthe thick
, like ketchup
, eventually drowning the movie on
- screen
.
( the middle hour is a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assault on the averege primate
' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies in this movie
, a crew member inevitably yells out
" we lost
( insert dead person
' s last name here
)
!
" i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil
- guy
- cum
- astronaut from a live one
,
and close
- ups of the corpses
' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance
, as their skin wass often covered in fake blood
. armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
and has fewer plot
- holes withing its equally ludicrous framework
. it has a vivid soundmix
.
but at almost two
- anbd
- a
- half hours
, i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story
. the love story has beeen played up in the ads
, perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout
- erase all
thoughts of nude sketching or car
- sex annd replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around inspite a moon
- crawler
. remember a littel film called jaws
? in this film
, threee independent
- minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark
. they didn
' t much like each other at frist
; eventually
, they started to respect one another
. one of jaws
' great scenes involved the would
- be
- ahabs drinking
and singing songs
and telling stories
. this is the sort of male
- bonding foreign to bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters into the mix
and expect we
' ll care about them on the grounds that thte world isnt about to end
. not once do we git the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances
- i
' d be surprised if these actors bothered tothe introduce themselves to one another before
" action
" was called
. a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don
' t bare their souls
, who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism
and a kind ofthe chest
- beating bravery
. to this
, i iwll respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: this team couldn
' t build a birdhouse
.
and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer
- a trailer for a movie written by a team of body
- builders
and greeting card authors
- i
' ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life
.
