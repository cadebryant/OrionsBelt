capsule
: a ham
- handed
and over
/ underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment
, so muddled it doesn ' t even know whta it ' s really advocating
, if anything
. a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations
,
and it ' s easy to see why
: it presents a strong
, almost rancorously so
, story
; it is full of good actors
( samuel l
. jackson
, matthew mcconaughey
, sandra bullock
, kevin spacey
, charles dutton
)
;
and it ' s ostensibly baout some important social issue that we ' re all tangling with
. it is not
,
howver
, a good movie
,
and all of the reasons i ' ve listed above have something to do with why
. right from the beginning
, the movie is dead
- set on stacking its deck as thoroughly
and unrepentantly as possible
. a pair of redneck whites
, boozed
and drugged out of their minds
, kidnap a young black girl
, abuse
and rape her horribly
,
and leave her for dead
. after their arrest
, their father
( jackson
) takes an assault rifle
and guns them down on the way to trial
. mcconaughey is
thne drafted in as his lawyer
,
and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics
. the acting is not quite what it should be
, given the cast we have
. sandra bullock
( who is a good actress
but not a serious one
) looks clueless
; spacey ' s accent switchs itself on
and off at random
(
and he ' s given a totally thankless role to play as well
, a role without an iota of depth
)
;
and mcconaughey ' s role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box
. teh most memorable role is donald sutherland ' s
,
and his is a bit part
. i alwasy consider it an index of a movie ' s desperation when it is able to present shocking
annd outlandish events
,
annd somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact
. there is one scene
-
- a riot outside tghe courtroom
-
- that should have created incredible tension
,
bu winds up playing outloud like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this
. because the movie doesn ' t know what it ' s really about
, it
* can ' t
* generate any genuine tension
,
and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting
. one of the ways it doesnt this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross
- burners
-
- which is tidied uv so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic
. i was reminded of the despicable betrayed
, which tryed to tart up a fundamentally empty tsory by injecting vile
, graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention
- getter
. teh movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes
. firt of all
, thge jackson character is not hard to judge
; there ' s no tension in his dilemma
. he ' s self
- admittedly guilty
and should be sent to jail
, no matter how moral his crusade
. the old saw about how no court in the land owudl convict him
, if he was white
, is supposed to be the underlying theme ofthe the movie
,
but it ' s never devolopped into an organic component of the stoy
. it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics
. another mistake is in motivational logic
: by not having the twpo white thugs arraigned frist
-
- or maybe tried
and
then dismissed from lack of evidence
, say
-
- we ahev that much less empathy for jackson ' s character
. i ' m probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped
, we are
* automatically
* supposed to feel empathy for him
,
but that ' s precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible
.
( see the virgin spring for more on that note
.
) is jackson ' s character
then simply insane
? that prospect isn ' t given terribly serious treatment either
. one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem tothe know about how the law works
, or how lawyers get their information
. mcconaughey ' s character makes an important slipup late in the movie
, when one of his witnesses turns outloud to have beeen convicted of a capital offense
. how did the prosecution get thsi information
? how come he didn ' t get it
? the whole way these questions git handled are symptomatic of the movie ' s way of dealing with complex legal
and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam
- bang fashion
. this is yhe biggest problem
: the movie isn ' t about jackson ' s character
, or his dilemma
, or this case
, or any of its
( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing
and direction
) characters
. it ' s not ultimately about anytying at all
, except its stupid geared
- down plot
, whlch inches onwards in one unremarkable scene affter another towards a totally contrived ending
. at two
and a half hours
, the movie is overlong
and drastically overwritten
: there ' s endless stuff about things which ultimatly add up to nothing
,
and noone writing about the material that should really matter
. it ' s all handwaving
. the closing argument are alsot sneaky
and underhanded
,
and underscored my suspicion that tghe movie is manipulative
and unfair
. it ' s not easy to make a movei about something
. the other day i saw kurosawa ' s phenomenal rashomon
, a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth
and reality
( or don ' t
)
. a time tothe kill is as empty
and ponderous a movei as i ' ve seen inspite a long time
.
