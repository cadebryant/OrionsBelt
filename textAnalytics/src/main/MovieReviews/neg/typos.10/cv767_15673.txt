everything about this ninth trek movie seems onthe the cheap
, from the roger corman
- grade special effects to its highly derivative
and ugly ad campaign
( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trak vi
: the undiscovered country
)
.
but piller
' s not
- quite
- half
- baked screenplay shoudln ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection
' s failure
. i
' m about to give the same advice to rick berman adn co
. as i
' ve given tothe the financiers of james bond movies
: it
' s tiome to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers
and a real director
.
( while we
' re at it
, put that visor back on laforge
!
) for three hundred years
, the ba
' ku species
( who look just like humans
) have lived on a ringed
- planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth
. six hundred of them occupy the briar patch
, the area affected by metaphasic radition
, a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly
.
but evil ru
' afo
( this is probably abraham
' s lsat stop before performing
" amadeus
" at a dinner theatre near you
)
, leader of the son
' a
( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery
)
, wants to relocate the ba
' ku
and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place
, in order to replenish his dying breed
. the federation is all for this
,
but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive
: to not interfere with the development ofthe an alien race
.
( never mind that the ba
' ku didn
' t exactly evolve
- they went w
andering in the universe oen day
and stumbled upon the magic world
.
) every time frakes gives an interview lately
, he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding htis installment
. he has called it a comedy
, a thingking man
' s picture
, a throwback to the ood series
,
and
, most grievously
, he has likened it to a john ford western
.
( i presume that
' s some john ford he went to school with
, not the director of the searchers
.
) he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version
. thta
' s no excuse
- someone generated this footage
. muddy cinematography
and sitcom sets are the least of its problems
; star trak
: insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia
. consider such curiosities
.
.
. picard
' s love interest
, anij
( donna murphy
)
, can slow things down by staring at them
( such as a waterfall or falling rocks
)
- her scientific explanation for this
?
" don
' t ask
.
" worf gets a pimple
( he
' s re
- experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the tiem
- defying atmosphere
)
, laforge regains his eyesight
( trust me
, levar burton
' s real eyes are scarier thna those electronic lenses he wore iin first contact
)
and troi brags about her firm boobs
,
but picard remains as bald as an
android
' s
butt
. most suspiciously
, what exactly is the problem with letting htis endangered race hvae a little fun in the sun
? the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense baout a family feud of sorts
,
and they allso turn ru
' afo into a completely power
- mad superfreak
, just so thge characters will have something to do inwhich the climax
.
(
and if you
' ve seen return of yhe jedi
, you
' ve seen the ending of this movie
.
) didn
' t picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions
? frakes lucked out with first contact
,
and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection
: he has no sense of comic timing
,
and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists
.
( take a look at tghe painful
" troi gets drunk
" scene infact fc
and you
' ll get the general idea of insurrection
' s unsuccessfully jokey
and hollow tone
.
) even the worst shatner
and co
. treks
, like the final frontier
, maintained a watchability thanks to tyhe effortless
, charming comaraderie between kirk
, spock
,
and bones
. neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher
( gates mcfadden
, whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique
)
, troi
, or laforge
.
and all three next generation films spend too much time on data
, who is the franchise
' s answer to urkel
. need a cheap laugh
? have data sday something sexual
, or start singing
, or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it
' s the hunk of styrofoam it really is
. here
' s my proposed title for number 10
: data star data trek
: data data data data data
. in this movie
, data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose
, while crusher
and troi watch silently from 500 yards away
and laforge points his sinister gaze at the
android in doubly robotic obervation
. star trek
: insurrection had one nice
, eerie
, silent moment that hints at a better
, darker film
. i
' m not saying all of them should be star trek ii
: the wrath of khan
,
but this one boldly went where noone movie should go again
.
