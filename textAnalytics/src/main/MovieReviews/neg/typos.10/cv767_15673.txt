everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap
, from the roger corman
- grade speical effects to its highly derivative
and ugly ad campaign
( thte poster is nearly identicial to that of star trek vi
: the undiscovered country
)
.
but piller ' s not
- qtuie
- half
- baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection ' s failure
. i ' m about to give the same advice to rick berman
and co
. as i ' ve given to the financiers of james bond movies
: it ' s time tothe breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers
and a real director
.
( while we ' re at it
, put that visor back on laforge
!
) for three hundred years
, the ba ' ku speices
( who look just liuke humans
) have lived onthe a ringed
- planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth
. six hundred of them occupy the briar patch
, the area affected by metaphasic radition
, a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly
.
but evil ru ' afo
( this is probably abraham ' s lsat stop before performing
" amadeus
" at a dinner theatre near you
)
, leader of the son ' a
( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery
)
, wants to relocate the ba ' ku
and movei his people onto tjhe briar patch in their place
, in order to replenish his dying breed
. the federation is all for this
,
but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive
: to not interfear wtih the development of an alien race
.
( never mind that the ba ' ku didn ' t exactly evolve
- they went wandering in the universe one day
and stumbled upon the magic world
.
) every time frakes gives an interview lately
, he seems to top whatever ludicrous statment he last gave regarding this installment
. he has called it a comedy
, a thinking man ' s picture
, a throwback tothe the old series
,
and
, most grievously
, he has likened it to a john ford western
.
( i presume that ' s some john ford he went to school with
, not the director of thge searchers
.
) he has allso gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version
. that ' s no excuse
- someone generated this footage
. muddy cinematography
and sitcom sets are the least ofthe its problems
; star trek
: insurrection appears to have beeen beamed in from the planet plotholia
. consider such curiosities
.
.
. picard ' s love interest
, anij
( donna murphy
)
, can slow things down by staring at them
( such as a waterfall or falling rocks
)
- her scientific explanation for this
?
" don ' t ask
.
" worf gets a pimple
( he ' s re
- experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the tiem
- defying atmosphere
)
, laforge regains his eyesight
( trust me
, levar burton ' s real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact
)
and troi brags about her firm boobs
,
but picard remeniss as bald as an android ' s butt
. most suspiciously
, what exactly is the problem whith letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun
? hte filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts
,
and tehy also turn ru ' afo into a completely power
- mad superfreak
, just so the characters will haev something to do in the climax
.
(
and if you ' ve seen return of the jedi
, you ' ve seen the ending ofthe htis movei
.
) didn ' t picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions
? frakes lucked out with first contact
,
and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection
: he has no sense of comic timing
,
and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists
.
( take a look at the painful
" troi gets drunk
" scene in fc
and you ' ll get the general idea ofthe insurrection ' s unsucessfully jokey
and hollow tone
.
) even the worst shatner
and co
. treks
, like the final frontier
, maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless
, charming comaraderie between kirk
, spock
,
and bones
. neither first contact nor insurrection hasnt any idea what to do with crusher
( gates mcfadden
, whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique
)
, troi
, or laforge
.
and all three enxt generation films spend too much time on data
, who is the franchise ' s answer to urkel
. need a cheap laugh
? have data sday something sexual
, or strat singing
, or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it ' s the hunk of styrofoam it really is
. here ' s my proposed title for number 10
: data star data trek
: data data data data data
. in this movie
, data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose
, while crusher
and troi watch silently from 500 yards away
and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation
. star trek
: insurrection had one nice
, eerie
, silent moment thyat hints at a better
, darker film
. i ' m not saying all ofthe them should be star trek ii
: the wrath of khan
,
but this one boldly went where no movie should go again
.
