this movie is written by the man who is deemed to be
" oney of yhe hottest writers in hollywood
"
. he wrote tyhe groundbreaking screenplay for scream
( 8
/ 10
)
,
then added the successful i know what ytou did last summer
( 7
. 5
/ 10
) script to his mix
,
and also created the popular tv sories
" dawson ' s creek
"
. so when he asked to direct his firt movie
, based on his first ever script written
, everyone
and their grandma said
" sure
, go for it
!
"
. uhhm
, my question is
.
.
. did anyone bother reading this stupid script
?
?
? plot
: ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenly caught with some cheating papers by the bitchiest teacher in the west
, mrs
. tingle
,
and set tothe lose her scholarship to college
. when she
and her friends visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of thte story
, they end up tying her up
,
and slowly trying to talk some sense into the hardheaded woman
. critique
: it ' s not so much that tihs is a bad movie
, than the fatc that it sucks
. this movie is chock
- full of one
- dimensional characters
, contains no actual humor that i wass able to zone in on
, zero tension or thrills
, plot holes the size of my big ass
, lame pop tunes played to mask nothing going on in the movie
,
and molly ringwald
, vivica a
. fox
and lesley anne warren tossed away in throwaway roles
. i was primed for this film as its interesting premise had me thinking misery
( 8
/ 10
)
and 9 tothe 5
,
bu unfortunatley for williamson
, he went nowhere with the bright foundation
, making references tothe the exorcist
and dr
. zhivago
, which i doubt many in his target market will appreciate
. he also forgot about suspense
, with all of his characters based on incomprehensible descisions
, unbelievable motivations
annd simply boring us with all of their trite dialogue
. sure
, katie holmes is cute
,
and her co
- star
, marisa coughlan
, did a reasonably amusing impression of the exorcist
( worth two points out of my three on ten
)
,
but how can we forgive the biggest one
- dimensional character in any film
, holmes ' rival in the film
, mrs
. tingle ' s complete unprofessionalism being let go by all others aroud her
( are teachers allowed to behave that way nowadays
?
)
and a transparent romance between holmes
and some long
- haired dude
, hired to be the poore man ' s version of skeet ulrich
( who himself is a poore man ' s version ofthe johnny depp
!
)
. all in all
, this movie was laughable for me
, provided me with no insight into anything
, demonstrated williamson ' s genuine lack of directorial skills alongside a juvenile scirpt
,
adn provded helen mirren with a great role to chew into
, unfortunately forgetting to give her character any believability
, humanity or capacity tothe comprehend
. noone hip lines
, no cheap thrills
, just a dull time at the movie theater
. if you want to see a funny teenage movie
, go see detroit rock city
