thsi movie isnt based off the wildly popular video
- game series of the same nmae
. before thsi film
, the game had a few spin
- off cartoons
- which weere ok
.
but the idea of doing a movie is insane
. it should have been animated
, if it should have been done at all
. instead the people do the best they cin with a talented cast
.
yet it still fails
. the plot is completly different from tyhe gam
' s plot
- i
' m not complaining about that
. thge story involves the mario bros
. having a plumbing business in brooklyn
and having tothe compete with a rival company
. eventally htey find a construction site by their nemesis
, which happens to be enviromentally un
- safe
. so
, due to luigi
' s
( john leguizamo
) girlfriend
- princess daisy
- they go
and investigate
. tehy get transported to a blade runner
- esque world lead by king koopa
( dennis hopper
)
. somehow a plot dealing with all the dinosaurs being mutated
and transported to an alternate futuristic mega
- city jumbles in
. the plot is fine
- better than the movie deserves
. the acting is ok
. this seems to be more of a visual film
. the special effects are ogod
, especially on the robotic yoshi
.
however the film drags
and isnt no fun
.
and it leaves itself opne to a sequel
, which probably won
' t ever be made
. htis movie begins sort of promising
,
but ends up leaving a weird taste in your mouth
. so if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the excellent dennis hopper
,
then watch super mario bros
.
: the movie
. yuo could do worse
.
but you could definitly do better
.
.
.
. street fighter
: the movie
( 1995
) starring
: raul julia
and jean claude van
- damme this movie ws based off of a series of never ending sequels tothe a gae called street fighter 2
. it has all the characters from the gam in a reasonable plot
. it is more like a
" movie
" than it should be
. yes
, it
' s watchable
. raul julia does a good job
, considering this wass his final film
. while the gae had non
- stop fighting sequences
, this movie is a hodge
- podge of action scenes
and flashy sets
and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the same tyme
. does it work
? sort of
.
.
. the plot involves the evil shadowloo organization run by m
. bison
( raul julia
)
. guile
( jean claude van
- damme
) takes his troops to attack bison
' s main base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has tooked over
. in a short ammount of time
, the movie introduces several characters well
. it catches your attention
.
but it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of the game so you can point out things like
" there
' s chun li
!
!
" or
" look at that fire
- ball ryu did at vega
"
. it hits the bases by presenting the characters in a plot with good sets
,
but goes no further
. this movie needed more action in the first place
. the acation scenes tyhat are here are short
and not vrey exciting
. if you like light
- hearted action flicks
, or if you liked the game
, watch this one
. it is even worth watching if you want to see raul julia
' s last performance
, or if you can
' t get enough of van damme
. other than that
, you could find better action flicks
.
