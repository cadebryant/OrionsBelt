the great ctor james woods once said
(
and i
' m paraphrasing
)
,
" if sex isn
' t messy
,
then ytou
' re not doing it right
"
. a truly profound statement
,
and noe that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre
( just replace
" sex
" with
" your mad slasher film
"
)
. for those uninformed souls
, the mad slasher genre
( or sub
- genre
) is a melding of horror
and exploitation elements put tothe the service of a plot that follows an identical outline
: a usually masked
but always crazed killer stalks
and kills attractive teens a la halloween
. urban legend is a mad slasher flick
,
but one that is so sanitary
, bloodless
,
and nudity free
, that with its irony laden dialogue
and beautiful
(
though nto overly talented
) cast
, it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special
. for film makers
, gore is one of the two weapons they hvae at their disposal in a stale
, fright
- free horror movie
, as stephen king once said
( again paraphrasing
)
" if you can
' t scare your audience
, gross em
' out
, if you can
' t do that
, make em
' laugh
"
. alas
, urban legend succeeds only at the latter
,
though not by intention
. i atcually find the fact tyhat this film bcame a minor succsess
(
$ 40 milion domestic box office gross
) more frightening than anything in it
. it seems that audiences
' tastes ahev been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benifit of the doubt
. the pomotion for urban legend sure promised thrills
,
but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them
. unfortunately
, these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations
; one idiotic super
- hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don
' t need to do anything more than promise a good tiome without the added pressure of delivering
. if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman
and robin
, wild wild west
,
and godzilla
.
but forget all that
, it goes without saying that mad slasher films
( or any other exploitation off
- shoot
) will be made without an ounce of craft
( especially concidering the sheer volume that are produced
)
. allow me to present you whith hte real fault of the mad slasher film
: the lack of enthuseastic exploitation
. these flicks aren
' t harnessed with any lofty aspirations
, so why not break free
and give your audience a bloody ogod time
? sadly out of the literally hundreds made
, i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while
.
and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three
. despite its considerable production value
and the absence of any boom mics slipping inot frame
, it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes
. as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend
' s setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities
: it takes place on a college campus
, which is always an appropriate playground fo the crazed killer
. you see
, the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of stange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface
. all those young peopel are growing uv together
, going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs
and lows
, so naturally some weirdness is expected
. all the better for that elusive crazed killer
. coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around
,
and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task
.
but alas
, urban legend is nto only idiotic
and clich
?
? full
; it
' s way too clean
, a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity
, little gore
,
and much stupidity
. this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for noone reason other than
, i dunno
, exercise
. it
' s the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a runing
- like
- the
- wind
- prey
,
yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques
. it
' s the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack
. i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud
- noise
- jump
- scare thing
. yes the audience jumps
, momentarily frightened
,
but wouldn
' t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infilitrated a quiet room
. i lost all hope for thte possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in wehn i caught a glimpse of the killer
. apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers
. in scream it ws a ghost mask
( scary enough
)
, in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man
' s rain slicker
( in tghe middle of summer no less
)
,
and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody
: the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood
( ooh
?
?
? scary
) intended to conceal his
/ her identity
. for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume
.
though i must admit
, urban legend does have a winning premise forthe what could have been a somewhat entertaining explotation film
. the film
' s killer slices
and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends
( you know
, like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they
' re coming from inside the house
)
. i won
' t spoil thge surprise as to what urban legends are used
, after all the film does offer fine 2
: 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough
. sad to say
, it doesn
' t include my favorite urban legend
: a fairly graphic antidote conserning richard gere
and a very unhappy gerbil
. now that would be scary
. before i leave you
, i would like tothe bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film
( tghe frist being the lack of craft
, teh second the lack ofthe exploitation
)
-
- its characters
, all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i
' ve ever spent an evening with
. only jared leto
( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day
)
and alicia witt
, as the resilient heroine
, avoid vexatiousness
. teh most annoying of the bunch is a tye between noxima girl rebecca gayheart
and sitcom star michael rosenbaum
, as a supremely irritating lout
( so irritating i atually cheered his painful death
,
and i am nto a cruel person
)
. ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment inspite the film
; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining
. after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can
' t st
and getting slaughtered
, which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i cant
' t st
and not getting slaughtered
.
