except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy
, that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through
. bette midler
and dennis farina play lilly
and dan
, actress
and author
, once married
, nowe violently divorced
,
and back together one last time for their daughter molly ' s
( paula marshall
) wedding
. lilly
and dan hate each otehr passionately
-
- so passionately that they have sex at the wedding
and fall in love again
. each ditches his or her current spouse ofthe 14 years
and runs off with the other
. molly
, married now only 24 hours
, runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith
( jamie denton
) tries to console the abandoned spouses
. in molly ' s searhc for her parents
, she somehow falls in lveo wiht lilly ' s paparazzo joey
( danny nucci
)
. meanwhile
, the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan ' s wife rowena
( gail o ' grady
) in bed
. the audience i saw this with apparently thought thast all the adultery wass hilarious
. i ' m no dan quayle
,
but i thought it was a bit creepy
. the message seemed to be
" ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly
annd have fun fucking who you wish
.
"
" family values
" aside
, there ' s something cruel about all this
. perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy
,
but thge movie is a romantic comedy
. we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps
. reiner
anbd screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable
. lilly ' s husband is a new
- age flake who rambles about
" emotional valet parking
,
" so we can write him off as irrelevant
. dan ' s wife is vain
, manipulative
,
annd jealous so we can write her off as a bitch
. molly ' s husband is a career
- conscious
, self
- centered republican politician who thikns she ' s too fat
(
and just for good measure
, he also fucked dan ' s wife
)
, so we can write him off as a prick
. everyone else falls in love
.
but still
, that somehow doesn ' t justify the actions of the movie ' s main characters
.
" he ' s a prick
" or
" she ' s a bitch
" isnt no defense
. the movie is somewhat redeemed by smoe funny dialog
-
- oftenly during heated arguments
-
-
and by above
- averege performances by midler
and farina
( breaking out of his character
- actor mold
)
. other than thyat
, it ' s a standard romantic comedy with a vyre substandard gimmick
.
