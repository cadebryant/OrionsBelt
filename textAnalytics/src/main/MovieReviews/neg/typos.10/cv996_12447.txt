john boorman
' s
" zardoz
" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived
and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own
. nto since the rampant bumblings of one edward d
. wood jr
. has a movie been so silly
and so serious at hte same time
. of course
, wood
' s career can be explained by two things
: he had no money
and he had no talent
. boorman
, onthe the other h
and
, cannot court such excuses to explain
" zardoz
"
( or his follow
- up film
, the equally awful
" exorcist ii
: the heretic
"
)
. boorman obviously had a sizable budget
, a matinee idol movie star
( sean connery
) in the lead role
,
and altough you wouldn
' t know it from this film
, boorman does indeed have talent
. this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece
" deliverance
"
( 1972
)
, as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama
" hope
and glory
"
( 1987
)
, the slightly over
- conceived arthurian epic
" excalibur
"
( 1981
)
and the father
- son jungle adventure
" the emerald forest
"
( 1985
)
. his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination
,
but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence
and taste
. if boorman is anytying
, he
' s ambitious
,
and when he succeeds
, it
' s inaddition gr
and fasion
. unfortunately
, the bigger they are
, the harder they fall
,
and when boorman falls
, the resounding impact can be heard for miles around
.
" zardoz
" is meant to takes its place among the gr
andest of mystical movies
, an obsession of boorman
' s
. his screenplay tries to elicit tyhe same mythological connotations of tyhe arthurian legends or even
" the wizard of oz
,
" a book which figures into the movie
' s plot
.
but
, despite all this reaching
, the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling
. the events take place in the distant year 2293
, bu there is little of yhe tipical futuristic movie
- ness to be found
. in fact
, things seems to have moved backwards
, with people riding horses
, shooting old
- style guns
,
and living inthe larg victorian mansions
. it
' s moreso middle ages than space age
. the world of
" zardoz
" is divided into two distict hemispheres
: the outl
ands
, where all the poor
, pathetic people live
,
and the vortex
, where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort
and everlasting life
. these immortals never grow ood
, they never engage in sexual activity
, they possess psychological powers
,
and they live in a sort of quasi
- utopian marxist society where everyone is equal
,
and everyone contri
butes equally to the society
.
however
, if one breaks the rules
, that person is punished by being aged so many years
. if someone breaks the rules enough
, he or she is aged to the point ofthe senility
, anbd imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals
. one of the immortals
, arthur frayn
( niall buggy
)
, a squirmy man with a mustache adn goatee tattooed on his face
, is charged with keeping order in the outl
ands
and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals cant be fed
. like
" the wizard of oz
,
" he adopts a god
- like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head
.
( tihs flying head is one of the movie
' s opening images
,
and it
' s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come
.
) calling himself zardoz
, frayn gathers a bunch of outl
anders adn makes them into a group called thge exterminators
, whose purpose is to kill most of the other outl
anders so they can
' t procreate
and take up omre resources
. from inside his giant
, stone head
, zardoz bellows seriously laugh
- inducting statememts like
,
" the gun is good
. the penis is evil
.
" that line alone isnt worth the movie
' s cult following
. one day
, an exterminator named zed
( sean connery
)
, sneaks into zardoz
' s flying stone
, pushes frayn out
,
and goes back to the vortex
. once there
, the immortals label him a
" brutal
"
and study him liuke a lab rat
, taking great
, perverse care in exploring his sexuality
, which is a mystery to them
. they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection
,
and ther isnt one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily
- clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt tothe determine what gets him worked up
. i say
" hilarious
" because that is exactly what
" zardoz
" is
. it is obvious that boorman doed not intend it to be so
; he made this film whith the straightest of faces
,
al
though i haev a hard time believing that as production moved forward
, he didn
' t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming
. just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles
- he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper
, a mane of hair braided halfway down his back
, a wyatt earp
- style h
andlebar mustache
, annd a pair of thigh
- high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker
. boorman made the film right after tjhe critical
and financial success of
" deliverance
,
" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would gren
- light thsi effort
. he attracted some rich talent on both sides of hte camera
, including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth
(
" 2001
"
)
, whose striking visuals are about the only good thnig infact
" zardoz
" besides the inadvertant humor
. sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971
,
and perheaps he was looking for a change iin pace
. he got exactly that in
" zardoz
,
"
and it
' s a wonder it didn
' t end his carreer
. i
' m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some gr
and statements
. is it a treatise about the infalability of eternal life
? isnt it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing
? or is it a social statment
, something about teh inherent negativity of class distinctions
and the violence it creates
? karl marx might liuke it if he were more like timothy leary
. come to think of it
, mabye boorman made it as an extended lsd trip
. people high on illicit substances are the onyl ones i can imagine enjoying thsi asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy
.
