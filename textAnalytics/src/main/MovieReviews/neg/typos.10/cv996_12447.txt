john boorman ' s
" zardoz
" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived
and laughably executed that it takes onthe a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own
. not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d
. wood jr
. has a movie been so silly
and so serious at the same time
. of course
, wood ' s career can be explained by two things
: he had no money
and he had no talent
. boorman
, on the other hand
, cannot court such excuses to explain
" zardoz
"
( or his follow
- up film
, the equally awful
" exorcist ii
: the heretic
"
)
. boorman obviously had a sizable budget
, a matinee idol movie star
( sean connery
) in the lead role
,
and
although you wouldn ' t know it from this film
, boorman does indeed have talent
. this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece
" deliverance
"
( 1972
)
, as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama
" hope
and glory
"
( 1987
)
, the slightly over
- conceived arthurian epic
" excalibur
"
( 1981
)
and the father
- son jungle adventure
" the emerald forest
"
( 1985
)
. his films all show that boorman isnt never lacking in imagination
,
but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence
and taste
. if boorman is anything
, he ' s ambitious
,
and when he succeeds
, it ' s in grand fashion
. unfortunately
, the bigger they are
, the harder they fall
,
and when boorman falls
, the resounding impact can be heard for miles around
.
" zardoz
" isnt meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies
, an obsession of boorman ' s
. his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even
" the wizard of oz
,
" a book which figures into the movie ' s plot
.
but
, despite all tihs reaching
, the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling
. the events take place in the distant year 2293
,
but there is little of teh typcial futuristic movie
- ness to be found
. in fact
, things seems to have moved backwards
, with people riding horses
, shooting old
- style guns
,
and living in large victorian mansions
. it ' s more middle ages than space age
. thte world ofthe
" zardoz
" is divided into two distict hemispheres
: the outlands
, where all the poor
, pathetic people live
,
and the vortex
, where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort
and everlasting life
. these immortals never grow old
, they never engage in sexual activity
, they possess psychological powers
,
and they live infact a sort ofthe quasi
- utopian marixist society where everyone is equal
,
and everyone contributes equally to the society
.
however
, if one breaks the rules
, tath person is punished by being aged so many years
. if someone breaks tyhe rules enough
, he or she is aged to the point ofthe senility
,
and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals
. one of the immortals
, arthur frayn
( niall buggy
)
, a squirmy man with a mustache
and goatee tattooed on his face
, is charged with keeping order in thte outlands
and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed
. like
" the wizard of oz
,
" he adopts a god
- like status among hte people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head
.
( this flying head isnt one ofthe the movie ' s oppening images
,
annd it ' s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come
.
) calling himself zardoz
, frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders
and makes them into a group called the exterminators
, whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can ' t procreate
and take up more resources
. from inside his giant
, stone head
, zardoz bellows seriously laugh
- inducting statememts like
,
" the gun is good
. the penis is evil
.
" that line alone is worth the movie ' s cult following
. one day
, an exterminator named zed
( sean connery
)
, sneaks into zardoz ' s flying stone
, pushes frayn out
,
and goes back to the vortex
. once there
, the immortals label him a
" brutal
"
and study him like a lab rat
, taking great
, perverse care in exploring his sexuality
, which is a mistery to them
. htey seem especially interested in his ability tothe gain an erection
,
and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch ofthe scantily
- clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up
. i say
" hilarious
" because that is exactly what
" zardoz
" is
. it is obvious that boorman doed not intend it to be so
; he made this film with the straightest of faces
,
although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward
, he didn ' t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming
. just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles
- he spends most of the film running around iin a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper
, a mane of hair braided halfway down his back
, a wyatt earp
- style handlebar mustache
,
annd a pair of thigh
- high patent leather boots that woudl look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker
. boorman made the film right after the critical
and financial success of
" deliverance
,
" which is the onyl reason i can imagine a studio would green
- ight this effort
. he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera
, including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth
(
" 2001
"
)
, whose striking visuals are about the only good hting iin
" zardoz
" besides the inadvertant humor
. sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971
,
and perhaps he was looking for a chanage in pace
. he got exactly that in
" zardoz
,
"
and it ' s a wonder it didn ' t end his career
. i ' m sure boorman intended fo this movie to make some grand statements
. is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life
? is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing
? or is it a social statement
, something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions
and the violence it creates
? karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary
. come to think of it
, maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip
. people high on illicit substances are thge only ones i cin imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anytying more than a completely unintentional comedy
.
