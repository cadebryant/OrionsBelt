. review
: there is one reason why
" jurassic park iii
" is better than its immediate predecessor
,
" the lost world
: jurassic park
"
. the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life
; the former
, only 94
. hte first
" park
" was a marvellous film
, full of awe
- inspiring sights
, interesting characters
,
and genuine thrills
. its two successors have been pale imitations
, amounting to hundred
- million
- dollar b
- grade horror movies
. at least this third entry realises it
; whereas
" the lost world
" tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous
and overextended plot
,
" jurassic park iii
" simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs
adn lets the mayhem beign
. there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie
; the computer
- animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting
,
and even the first
- time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation
. remember that wondrous frist trolley ride through the park in the original movie
? nothing in this rehash even comes close
. add inwhich execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman
, payne
and taylor
,
and phoned
- in performances by the normally capible macy
and leoni
,
and it isnt difficult tothe recommend the film to anyone
but dino enthusiasts
. at least neill makes some affort to retain the dignity of his character
,
and there is much less gore than in
" the lost world
"
, making this installment mroe suitable fo children
.
