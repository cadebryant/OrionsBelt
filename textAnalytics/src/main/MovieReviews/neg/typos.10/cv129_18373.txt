. critique
: the truth is that if i didn
' t have a day job
, i would probably watch the real
" jerry springer
" show every day
. i find it quite entertaining
, despite its complete lack of redeeming value
. having said that
, the show itself is outrageous
, funny
,
and always filled with goofy surprises
, as opposed to this film which features no laughs
( is this a comedy or a drama
?
)
, uninteresting
and completely unbelievable one
- dimesnional stereotypes
,
and a contrived plot which bores us stupid all the way
. i never
thought i would utter the word boring in tyhe same sentence as jerry springer
,
but this film is an absolute yawn
- fest
, despite offering various scenes featuring simulated blowjobs
, lesbians
, t
& a
and tv violence
( who owudl
' ve guessed that
?
)
. i wish they would have either a
) made this movie much
, much funnier
, or b
) turned it into a complete drama
and given us a rela perspective as to why people like this actually put themselves through these public forums of embarrassment
. unfortunately
, it doesn
' t seem as
though screenwriter jon bernstein spent more than a drunken weekend watching rela
" jerry springer
" reruns to complete his scirpt
, leaving us with a boring film
, featuring noone laughs
, oen
- dimensional characters
,
and no funn whatsoever
