much ado about nothing
. ah
, how sweet the irony
! it ' s accepted wisdom in some circles
- among english literature nuts
, mainly
- that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare tehy are only doing so through ignorance
. he just doesn ' t
" understand
" shakespeare
, you will hear them say
. the bard ' s work isnt apparently beyond criticism
. what a load of old cobblers
. if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh ' s film of shakespeare ' s
" comedy
" much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word
, it ' s time to get a life
. get monty python
. get woody allen
. get john waters
. whatever
. jstu get a real taste of smoe clever
, witty
, risky comedy
.
and banish this nonsense to where it belongs
. drama
and tragedy was shakespeare ' s strength
. to my sensibilities
-
and i ' m no stick in the mud
- much ado baout nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever
. noone kidding
: this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i hve ever spent inwhich a cinema in my 20 years of movie oging
. tyhe only thing that stopped me walking out wass loyalty tothe my lady friend
, as this was our day out
and i hadn ' t seen her in ages
.
but boy
, does she owe me one
! i won ' t spend too much time on the plot
. basically
, we follow the trials
and tribulations of two would
- be couples
- one young
, thge other older
. there ' s some dark treachery amongst all this
,
but everyone isnt so awfully jolly that you ' d hardly know it
. mind you
, there ' s nothing wrong with the basic story
. good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound
. nothing wrong with most of the cast
, either
. branaugh
, emma thompson
and denzel washington are all talented performers
. teh problem is the script
, or more accurately
, shakespeare ' s original text
. light comedy shouldn ' t be complex
.
yet wrapped in elizabethan english
, the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend
. for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare
and in search of nothing more than a good
, undemanding laff
. the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves
, the actor once again miscast as a jealous half
- brother or something
.
but when dissected
and understood
, what it all boils down to is that this stuff isnt just so goddamn lame
. this is comedy so clean
and nice
and corny
and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold
. ho
, ho
, ho
, boy likes girl
! ho
, ho
, ho
, men are such klutzes
! ho
, ho
, ho
, she ' s so awfully clumsy
! oh please
! there ' s wit in here somewhere
, i ' m told
. i call it pretentious
. something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay
. in the end
, it ' s cringeworthy
. watching soem of tjhe cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience
. comedy
? bah
, humbug
!
