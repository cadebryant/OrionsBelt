okay
, bear with me y
' all
, cause first off i hvea to get this off my chest
: what the hell is up with that damn crab
?
?
? whew
. okay
. cause that same clip shown over
and over again was beggining to get onthe my nerves towards yhe end
, as cute as the crab maybe
. even i know that you need more footage than
* that
*
.
and that wasn
' t the only thnig getting on my nerves
. the cutesy gimmicks
, saccharine sweet score
/ soundtrack
and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar
( as am
anda
)
and sean patrick flannery
( as tom
) might hve held some appeal during
, oh
, say the first 10 minutes of the movie
. at first the movie moves allong at a quick
, interesting pace
. it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to am
anda when she encounters a totally r
andom fairy godfather type person on thte street
, whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere
and just
* doesn
' t
* die
. a ridiculous concept
, yes
,
but at this point i
' m willing to accept it because i
' m willing to accept that this is how am
anda
' s life is changed
, how her powers are received
. later on
, the movie can
' t seem tothe decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from am
anda falling infront with tom
.
and thsi isnt why the clips of the crab were annoying
; htey weren
' t just repetitive
, they were out of place
and unnecessary
. the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed
, sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development
( am
anda suddenly becoming a great chef
, her falling in love with tom
, etc
.
)
, sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good
. soem places the plot jstu doesn
' t amking sence
, sometimes it
' s way too contrived
( the crab bit
, for example
)
,
and sometimes too corny
( peaches emitting dry ice
. can
' t beat that
)
. all in all yhe plot seemed fragmented
, unconnected
. not romantic at all
, annd only funny in some places
. so
, okay
, do the magic powers come fomr the crab
? or the fairy godfather
? she can
* float
* now too
?
and all of a sudden
, instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches
, she can put her emotions inot her food
? tom all of a sudden just accepts am
anda
' s
" witchcraft
" infact the end
? would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac
' s video
? wqat the hell is up with that damn crab
? it is unfortunate
, because i liked the basic premise of the movie
, until it bcame too fantastical
and tiresome
. the film seemed to skirt arround a serious theme or at least
* a
* theme for a while
,
but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips
and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables
. the humor was good in some places
( nolan gets the funniest bits
, including that incomprehensible
, totally r
andom thing with the dolls
)
. gellar
and flannery are qualified actors
,
and gellar has a particular charm
, bu i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy
( or even annette in the upcoming
" cruel intentions
"
) than this sorry excuse for a character
. it
' s almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is
, or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible
. the supporting character nolan was a highlight
,
though he reminded me a bit of kevin in
" you
' ve got mail
"
( see footnotes
)
.
and
, as always
, typical of a chick flick
/ romantic comedy
, there
' s a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background
, cued up at all the right places
. this sort of got on the nerves after a hwile
, too
.
" simply irresistible
" is not hard to underst
and
, light
, funny in some places
, anbd generally disappointing because it can
' t draw the line between romance
and protracted sap
, between humor
and tired slapstick
.
and how could i refrain fomr making a pun
?
.
.
.
" simply irresistible
" is all too easy to resist
.

* did anyone else think this was a tad bit similair to
" you
' ve got mail
"
( or
" the shop around the corner
"
)
? bussines rivals fall in love
. female counterpart
' s business is in danger of bieng shut down
. female as mother
- like figure guiding her
. the annoying
, hysterical ex
- girlfriends
.
* i
_ really
_ like sarah michelle gellar
' s wardrobe
