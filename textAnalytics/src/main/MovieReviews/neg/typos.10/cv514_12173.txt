i didn
' t hate the big hit
, even
though it is a stupefyingly terrible film
. for the entirety of its running tiome
, my eyes were attached to the screen
,
and i never once got bored
. i found the film interesting beccause of its unique awfulness
: this is such a confuzled disaster of a film that it
' s entertaining to watch it in the smae way that it
' s entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl
. as a narrative
, the big hit is pure garbage
, never truly deciding its genre
and constantly crossing all kinds ofthe boundaries
. it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank
, which is a similar film that fails in a lot ofthe the same ways
. it
' s fine to mix genres
, if the film makers know what they
' re doing
. unfortunatley
, writer ben ramsey
and director kirk wong don
' t seem to know how to h
andle the material
,
and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy
. the biggest probelm with the amalgamation
, in this case
, isnt that the film is absurd
and the comedy is out of place
.
but it sure isnt a fascinating failure
. marky
.
.
. er
, mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley
, a hitman
. he
' s a good hitman
, apparently
,
al
though his tactics seem a bit rambunctious
( he doesn
' t snipe or mkea clean kills
-
- he just kicks yhe door down
and shoots everything
)
. he works with a few other hitmen
-
- cisco
( lou diamond phillips
)
, crunch
( bokeem woodbine
)
,
and vinnie
( antonio sabbato
, jr
.
)
. they
' re a nice bunch of muscular guys
, who st
and around in the locker room after working out
and compare masturbation to sex
. they all work fo a man named paris
( avery brooks
)
, who is rich
, powerful
,
and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen
. it isnt very important that htey never go beyond thier boss
and do work on their own
; this
, ofthe course
, isnt where the plot comes in
. they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko
( china chow
)
, who has a rich father
. when they do this
, it turns out she is paris
'
.
.
. goddaughter
! it
' s very bad tothe have paris against you
. the story is st
andard action film stuff
. it
' s nothing new
,
and nothing particularly offensive
(
but certainly not the slightest bited compelling
)
. claerly the major selling point of the big hit is tht it
' s a john woo
- tipe of action film mixed inaddition with some realy hip comedy
. it
' s true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the smae idea
( such as face
/ off
and the replacement killers
, which are both far superior
)
. there are stunts that are fun to watch
: the opening sequence has melvin
and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who hasnt nothing to do with tghe story
. they use night vision goggles
and really powerful h
andguns
. melvin is also very good at breakdancing
, adn uses this talent to avoid bullets
and knives
. like i said
, it
' s nto boring
; most disasters aren
' t
. what makes it so bad is its genre
- shifting madness
. it seems to start out as a quirky
-
but
- realistic action comedy
, as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains
.
then
, as soon as they go tothe their first hit
, it turns into a music video with bodies annd bullets flying everywhere
.
then
, somewhere inaddition between
, it turns back into comedy
. keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl
; in oney amusing scene
, she is forced to read a letter out loud
, indicating that she has been kidnapped
,
but the letter isnt littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words
.
and scenes like this work alone
,
but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes thast should be more serious
, or not be in the film at all
. one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has beeen kidnapped
; when cisco gets there
, paris
and his men are st
anding around as if they knew cisco did it
,
but htey let him out of there
, telling him to find tghe perpetrator
. the scene is played for laughs
,
but it isn
' t funny
. adn since it doesn
' t quite work as a comedy
, it tries to fall bcak on the action
, whcih also fails
. this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards whn shot with a h
andgun
. cars l
and on tree branches
and are supported by them
. characters betray each otehr without a second
thought
. grenades are thrown in tight places
. people jump out of tall buildings
and survive
. people outrun tumbling cars
,
and get out of the way of falling objects inaddition small fractions of seconds
. most frustrating of all
,
though
, is the film
' s definition of a hit man
: these guys are anything
but subtle
, quiet
,
and skilled indviduals
. htey
' re more like socially depraved militia men
( melvin hasnt an extensive collection of firearms in his garage
, includng missile launchers
and h
and
- held machineguns
)
. the characters eahc have oney trait that distinguishes them from the rest
; this obviously doesn
' t make for deep or interesting people tothe watch
. the acting is kind of fun
,
though
-
- wahlberg is a good actor
,
and his innocuous presence inthe tihs film is charming in a silly sort of way
. phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character
, while christina applegate
, who plays melvin
' s fianc
? e
, is convincingly air
- headed
. the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny
. the funniest parts are supplied by the actors
,
and not by thge numerous failed attempts at sight gags
and one
- liners
. it
' s a true disaster
, one that makes me beleive that the goofy
and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional
. despite all this
,
though
, i must reiterate the entertainment value here
. you cin cherish the awfulness of a film like this
. if you embrace the big hit for the catastrofy that it is
, yuo just might enjoy yourself
.
