so ask youself what
" 8mm
"
(
" eight millimeter
"
) is really all about
. is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy
, sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography
? is it about the business itself
, how
, bubbling just beneath the surface of big
- town americana
, there
' s a sordid world of sick
and depraved people who won
' t necessarily stop short of murder in order to satisfy their sick
and twisted desires
? or is it about those who can
, thsoe who are in a position to influence the making of the kinds of films sick
and demented people want to see
? i
' m not talking about snuff films
, supposed
" documentaries
" of victims being brutalized
and killed on camera
. i
' m talking about films like
" 8mm
"
and its director
, joel schumacher
. withthe a recent run ofthe big budget movies to his credit
-
-
" batman
& robin
,
"
" a time to kill
,
"
" batman forever
,
"
" the client
"
-
- schumacher certainly has that kind of influence
. is
" 8mm
" something you really want to see
? probably nto
. the first two
- thirds of
" 8mm
" unwind as a fairly conventional missing persons drama
, albeit with a particularly unsavory core
.
then
, as it
' s been threatening all along
, the film explodes into violence
.
and jstu when you think it
' s finally over
, schumacher tags on a ridiculous self
- righteous finale that drags the whole unpleasant experience down even further
. trust me
. there are better ways to waste two hours of your life

" snake eyes
"
' cage plays private investigator tom welles who is hired by a wealthy philadelphia widow to determine whether a reel of film found in her late husb
and
' s safe documents a young girl
' s murder
. welles goes baout his assignment rather matter
- of
- factly
,
and the pieces ofthe the puzzle fall into place rather neatly
, almost as if you don
' t need any specialized skills or training tothe do this
. welles certainly makes it look easy
.
and cops
, obviously
, never look in toilet tanks for clues
. the deeper welles digs into his investigation the more obsessed he becomes
, like george c
. scott in paul schrader
' s
" hardcore
.
" occasionally
, a little flickering sound whirs in his head like sprockets winding through a film projector
, reminding him of his unpleasant task
. there are hints that this is taking its toll on his lovely wife
, played by catherine keener
, who is frustrated by her husb
and spending all of his time in clevel
and rather than in their ugli split
- level home in harrisburg
, pa
.
" 8mm
" doesn
' t condemn or condone its subject matter
, it jsut exploits it
. the irony
, ofthe course
, is that schumacher
and
" seven
" scribe
andrew kevin walker
' s vision of life in the snuff lane is limited by what they can show in an r
- rated
, first
- run hollywood product
. so we only see snippets of snuff
,
and a lot more footage ofthe nicolas cage covering his face in horror
. later it
' s the turn of joaquin phoenix
( who
' s quite good annd by far the film
' s most interesting character as adult bookstore flunky max california
) to cover his face as tyhe horrid thign is screened over
and over agian
. all this to get to the familiar
yet offensive
" revelation
" that sexual deviants are not
, indeed
, monsters
but everyday people like you annd me
. neither super nor st
andard
,
" 8mm
" is shocking onyl in its banality
