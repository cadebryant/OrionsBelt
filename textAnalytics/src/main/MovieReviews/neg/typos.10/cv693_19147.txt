i have nothing against unabashedly rumatic films
. when done right
, withthe at least slightly evident restraunt
, they can be engaging
, sweeping
, appealing
.
but it
' s a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless iin seattle
, a hollow
, boring romance that shoudl appeal only to the most gullible of viewers
; the ones willing tothe buy into ephron
' s whiny views of life
and romance
. tom hanks
and meg ryan
, two of hollywood
' s most likeable stars play sam baldwin
and annie reed
, repectively
. baldwin
' s wife recently died
and he moved to seattle with his son
, jonah
, seeking to get awya from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse
. jonah senses tension
and calls a talk raido show to tell tghe world about their problems
. sam seems ready to strangle his son fo calling the show
,
but when he gets on tjhe phone he begins pouring his heart out
. ephron has him do this so that annie reed
( meg ryan
) can hear it
. annie isnt a happy woman
. she is engaged to walter
, an allergy
- prone working man
and seems to be perfectly content
. bu after hearing sam the widower on the radio show
, she becomes convinced that he is her destiny
and is willing to risk her engagement for it
. five years after this movie hit theaters
, hanks
, ryan
and ephron woudl team up again in the far better
,
al
though still sub
- par romantic comedy you
' ve got mail
, which is about people who hite each other in real life falling in love on the internet
. at least that movei had a sense of spontaneity
. here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up fo thge last five
. the fact that sam
and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory
. sleepless in seattle isnt full ofthe wonderful performers
; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman
and rosie o
' donnell
.
but none of them can save the film from being a bore
. its characters are dull
and empty
, its script isn
' t funny or particularly charming
. the script hasnt a fundametal problem
: annie gives up
, fo little reason
, her life with walter to pursue
" sleepless in seattle
,
" whom she has never even seen
. it
' s the kind of life decision that real people don
' t amke
,
and its a major
, unforgivable plausibility sacrifice
. inwhich essence
, this movie
' s purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldn
' t even exsist
. it
' s a ten minute short film with ninety
- five minutes of filler
. if you weere tothe show me sleepless in seattle
and i didn
' t have tothe review it
, you could just call me
" asleep in philadelphia
.
