' s review of
" session 9
"
( usa films
) sometimes you jsut get omre than your bargained fo
.
.
. like when boston
- based hazmat elimination
, run by scottish actor peter mullan
and his trusty assistant
, david caruso
, assures a twon engineer
( paul guilifoyle
) that htey can remove insidious asbetos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week
. erected in 1871
, deserted
and decomposing since 1985
, the danvers mental hospital
, is one of the most malevolent
" locations
" ever chosen forthe a film
. the structure is so massive
- with its labyrinth of rubble
- strewn corridors
, collapsing floors
, stagnant pools of water
, isolation cells
,
and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre
- frontal lobotomies were performed
- that their task seems impossible within that time frame
.
and each member of their inexperienced crew
( stephan gevedon
, br
andon sexton iii
,
and josh lucas
) is coping with his own personal demons as
, one by one
, thier minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in hwihc they
' re working
. the film
' s title is derived fomr salvaged reel
- to
- reel audio
- recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities
. by the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters
. filmmaker brad
anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw
- massacre
- type ghost story bu the script lacks structure
and isn
' t particularly scary
. the conclusion is more ludicrous tahn convincing
. on thge granger movie gaug of 1 to 10
,
" session 9
" is a dark
, gloomy 4
. silly me
.
.
. at first
, i
thought that the original name ofthe the danvers lunatic asylum bore some referece to mrs
. danvers
, the creepy housekeeper played by judith
anderson in alfred hitchcock
' s truly terrifying
" rebecca
" that also involved a cavernous mansion called m
anderley
.
