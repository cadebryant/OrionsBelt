susan granger ' s review of
" session 9
"
( usa films
) somtimes you just get more than your bargained for
.
.
. like wehn boston
- based hazmat elimination
, run by scottish actor peter mullan
and his trusty assistant
, david caruso
, assures a town engineer
( paul guilifoyle
) that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week
. erected in 1871
, deserted
annd decomposing usance 1985
, the danvers mental hospital
, is one of the most malevolent
" locations
" ever chosen for a film
. the structure isnt so massive
- with its labyrinth of rubble
- strewn corridors
, collapsing floors
, stagnant pools of water
, isolation cells
,
and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre
- frontal lobotomies were performed
- that their task seems impossible within that time frame
.
and each member of their inexperienced crew
( stephan gevedon
, brandon sexton iii
,
and josh lucas
) is coping with his own personal demons as
, one by one
, thier minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which they ' re working
. tjhe film ' s title isnt derived from salvaged reel
- to
- reel audio
- recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities
. by thte time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters
. filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned tihs as a gruesome chainsaw
- massacre
- type ghost story
but the script lacks structure
and isn ' t particularly scary
. the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing
. on the granger movei gauge of 1 to 10
,
" session 9
" is a dark
, gloomy 4
. silly me
.
.
. at first
, i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs
. danvers
, tje creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcock ' s truley terrifying
" rebecca
" that allso involved a cavernous mansion called manderley
