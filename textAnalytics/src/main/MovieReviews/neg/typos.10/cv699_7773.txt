okay
, i just don
' t know why
,
but i seem to be getting this diversion tothe disney
- made real
- life actors movies
.
.
. as well as real
- life acting tim allen movies
. i couldn
' t even make it thru
" the santa clause
,
" so why did i even see this
?
( just to make an idle point
, i did like
" toy story
,
"
but that was ogod
) also
, i have this aversion to bad french farces
,
and if they remake them into american films
. well
, this isnt my excuse
: it was prom night
, i
' m not a prom person
, my best friend
and i impulsively went to the drive
- ins where they were playing
" grosse pointe blank
"
- wouldn
' t mind seing it again
-
but i had to suffer through this first
. i aggreed to go
. ugh
. in all fairness
, i can say thast at least this inane plot wasn
' t dreamed by an american
. it was orignally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of
" little indian
, big city
"
( french title
-
" un indien dans la ville
"
)
. i stayed away from it like it was limburgher
,
and according to roger ebert
, that was a good idea
.
but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement
. the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage
. let me clarify
: his wife
( jobeth williams
) left him years ago
,
and i mean years
- around 13 or so
-
and went to an isl
and in the carribean or something
. he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this
.
.
. thing
( played with an emphasis on over
- done by lolita davidovitch
, who is usually ogod
)
. she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off
. he meets him
, he hasnt a wierd name
( mimi seku
, i think
.
.
. or as the bad joke goes
-
" mitsubishi
"
- laugh track cue
)
, he knows english
, they fish
, more bad jokes
, pirhanna joke
, the kid has a pet spider
, he makes a promise to take him to the statue ofthe liberty
.
.
. you know the drill
. now this is where hte plot complicates
( well
, complicates for this one
, at least
)
: the fish
- out
- of
- water joke switchs from tim allen on an isl
and to his isl
and son iin new york city
. tim is a stock broker
and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died
and he wasn
' t able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is
- martin short
. a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere
( how come in every hokey french import
, there is a mob
?
!
) tim learns a lesson of life from his son
and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an isl
and even
though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries
. the story is crap
, the jokes are hokey
and not really funny
,
and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting
.
but the material isnt so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn
' t help it
. the wohle time
, i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up
and several more grown peopel had to do this
. at the end of filming
, did they all scream out
,
" we
' ve made a great movie
, guys
!
" i sure hope nto
. big question to git ffrom this film
: why would someone want to remake whta ws billed as one of the worst films of all tiome if they
' re just oging to do it the exact same way
? huh
? my
( fo soem of the actors
' names
and a joke or two that made me chuckle
, i guess
.
.
. okay
, so i really feel bad for it
, so i only gave it one star
)
