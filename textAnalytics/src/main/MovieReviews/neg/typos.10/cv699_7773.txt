okay
, i just don ' t know why
,
but i seem tothe be getting this diversion tothe disney
- made real
- life actors movies
.
.
. as well as real
- life acting tim allen movies
. i couldn ' t even make it through
" the santa clause
,
" so why did i even see this
?
( just to make an idle point
, i doed like
" toy story
,
"
but that was ogod
) also
, i have this aversion to bad french farces
,
and if they remake them into american films
. well
, this is my excuse
: it was prom night
, i ' m not a prom person
, my best friend
and i impulsively went tothe thge drive
- ins where they were playing
" grosse pointe blank
"
- wouldn ' t mind seeing it again
-
but i had to suffer through this first
. i agreed tothe go
. ugh
. in all fairness
, i can say that at least this inane plot wasn ' t dreamed by an american
. it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of
" little indian
, big city
"
( french title
-
" un indien dans la ville
"
)
. i stayed away from it like it was limburgher
,
and according to roger ebert
, that was a good idea
.
but i can onyl imagin how bad that must be if this is an improvement
. hte stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son fomr his current marrige
. let me clarify
: his wife
( jobeth williams
) left him years ago
,
and i mean years
- around 13 or so
-
and went to an island in the carribean or something
. he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers singed so he can remarry this
.
.
. thnig
( played with an empahsis on over
- done by lolita davidovitch
, who is usually good
)
. she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off
. he meets him
, he has a weird name
( mimi seku
, i htikn
.
.
. or as the bad joke goes
-
" mitsubishi
"
- laugh track cue
)
, he knows english
, they fish
, more bad jokes
, pirhanna joke
, the kid has a pet spider
, he makes a promise to take him to tjhe statue of liberty
.
.
. you know the drill
. now this isnt where the plot complicates
( well
, complicates for this one
, at least
)
: the fish
- out
- of
- water joke switches ffrom tim allen on an island tothe his island son in new york city
. tim is a stock broker
and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died
and he wasn ' t able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is
- martin short
. a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere
( how cmo in every hokey french import
, there is a mob
?
!
) tim learns a lesson of life from his son
and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even
though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries
. yhe story isnt crap
, the jokes are hokey
and not really funny
,
anbd the actors have to struggle to make it interesting
.
but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn ' t help it
. the whole time
, i kept thingking that a grown person had to think this up
and severeal more grown people had to do this
. at the end ofthe filming
, did they all scream out
,
" we ' ve made a great movie
, guys
!
" i sure hope not
. big question to git from this film
: why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of teh worst films of all time if they ' re just going to do it the exact same way
? huh
? my
( fo some of the actors ' names
and a joke or two that made me chuckle
, i guess
.
.
. okay
, so i relaly feel bad for it
, so i only gave it oen star
)
