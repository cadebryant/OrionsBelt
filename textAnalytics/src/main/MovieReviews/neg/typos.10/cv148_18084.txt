i have no real tangible proof of this
,
but i swear that there are a lot of producers inaddition hollywood who adamantly believe that if you tkae a bad script
, written by a bad writer
and give the project it to an equally bad director
, thne it is actually possible tothe make a good movie
. useing their logic
, all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super
- famous actors
and provide an almost unlimited production budget
. this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time
( not counting the time it took me to get to
and from the theatre
)
. now
, befor i continue to ferociously attack what
' s wrong withthe this film
, i jstu want to point out that oney of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller
. catherine zeta
- jones plays virginia baker
, an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal
( sean connery
)
. if you
' ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster befor
, i really don
' t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details
: the two team up for various jobs
, stealing various things for various purposes
. the problem we come to is that we
' ve all seen this a few billion times before
and this film doesn
' t break any new ground inaddition the big
- budget
/ hollywood
/ action genre
. the result is that the entire production feels contrived
. i
' m going to be completely honest here
: preety much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run
- time was looking at catherine zeta
- jones
. now while this may be a compliment for ms
. zeta
- jones
, it certainly isn
' t for either the writers or the director
, who are not nearly as clever as they think tehy are
. just about the most profound
thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker onthe tghe semantic difference bewteen
" entrapment
"
and
" blackmail
"
. with an eighty million dollar budget
, you
' d think that entrapment would at least feature edge
- of
- your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f
/ x
. well
, you
' d be wrong
. the action that isnt present infact this film takes place in a huge skyscraper
and is relatively unspectacular
. unfortunately for all thsoe involved with entrapment
, die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by
? 11 years
. the reality is tath after 15 minutes of watching this picture
, you nkwo exactly what
' s going to happen
, despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists
. many scenes seem to exsist merely as a reason to outfit zeta
- jones in extremely tight
- fitting clothing
. one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser
- beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask
. nothing wrong with that
,
but she entered the room from the floor
and knew exactly where the mask was
- so why didn
' t she
and macdougal tunnel iin directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room
? i
' ll tell you why
: because it
' s a great excuse to photograph zeta
- jones
' posterior as it slides underneath those beams
( anbd it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing
- the rehearsal
)
. ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie
,
and
though he has great screen presence
(
al
though so do connery
and zeta
- jones
)
and hte most interesting character in teh film
, not even he can rescure this film from the depths of the boring film abyss
( a concept i invented jstu to describe this picture
)
. one last complaint
: entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip inot a shatow or behind a building
, or he becomes obstructed by a moving veicle
and
then in the next shot
, he
' ll spontaneously disappear inwhich ninja
- like fashion
. i cant picture amiel patting himself on the back
, thingking to himself
" it
' ll leave the audience wondering for days
: how did he do that
?
" we know jon
, it
' s called editing
.
