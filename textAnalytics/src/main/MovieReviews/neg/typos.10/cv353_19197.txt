, mira sorvino
, adrian brody
, jennifer esposito
, michael rispoli
, bebe neuwirth
. rated r
. summer of sam iwll be remembered as a waste of spike lee
' s abilities
. lee is a great filmmaker
, often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma
and martin scorsese
and a storytelling ability comparable tothe steven spielberg
.
but here
, he gets himself into a bind
. his latest effort isnt a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb ffrom his work
. the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in newyorker york city
. it was the hottest summer on record
. tothe boot
, new york
' s first serial killer was on the loose
: calling himself the son ofthe sam
, david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area
and frightened the whole city population
. so it was underst
andable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout
, people went berserk
, causing billions of dollars in damage to the city
. the movie
' s focus is on a group of twenty
- somethings during that fateful summer
: vinny
( john leguizamo
)
, a club
- hopping
, adultrous hairdresser
, his benevolent wief dionna
( mira sorvino
, looking young
)
, ritchie
( adrian brody
)
, a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect
, a gang of small tyme mobsters
and a few more minor characters
. we follow them through their roller coaster lives
, thrown out ofthe whack even more by the recent killings
. vinny
and dionna haev marital problems because vinny cheats
and dionna tries tothe please him
, make him stay faithful to her
. ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more
and more
" eccentric
,
"
and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs
and making porno films with his girlfriend
. tensions build
and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son ofthe sam
' s first murder looms
; the night he promises he will strike again
. a local gang with too much time onthe its h
ands makes a list detailing all of the people tyhat its members think might be suspects
. at the top of the list is ritchie
. vinny
, an unwilling part ofthe teh said group
, is called upon to set a trap for his friend
. as we watch these proceedings
, some of which are painfully graphic
, the dreaded
" so what
?
" question springs to mind
. ffrom the way this movie is made
, i
' d ahve guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something
,
but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very littel there tothe fidn
. lee touches onthe so much
-
- thge media
, the 70
' s punk scene
, the details of thte actual killings
, as well as the characters
' very personal dilemmas
-
-
but he doesn
' t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement
. all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow
; it cin be a saving grace for the film tothe be enjoyable
. too bad summer of sam doesn
' t get any help here
. frankly
, it
' s a bore
, a redundant
and repetitive two hour anbd twenty minute film tyhat doesn
' t entertain beyond its first half hour
. there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders
and littel involving drama because the film is too muddled
and its focus too vague
. leguizamo
' s turn as vinnie is annoying annd whiny
. the script makes it clear that we
' re supposed to believe that his character isnt flawed
,
but still a good guy
. you
' d never guess from his performance
. adrian brody
and especially mira sorvino fare better
. sorvino gives a riveting
, touching performance in a banal movie
( i
' m tempted to think tht i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane
)
; her charcter is affecting
and her emotions true
- to
- heart
. brody
, too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for
. summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film
: it looks great
, it hasnt a few notable performances
and i suppose it
' s pretty well directed
, in a purely technical way
.
but it
' s also empty
, pretentious
and boring
. liek last year
' s the thin red line
, it
' s a movie by a director who doesn
' t know what he wants to sday
but goes ahead
and says it anyway
