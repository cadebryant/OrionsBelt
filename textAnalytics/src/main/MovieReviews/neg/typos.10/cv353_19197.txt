" starring john leguizamo
, mira sorvino
, adrian brody
, jennifer esposito
, michael rispoli
, bebe neuwirth
. rated r
. summer ofthe sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee ' s abilities
. lee is a great filmmaker
, oftenly exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma
adn martin scorsese
and a storytelling abilty comparable to steven spielberg
.
but here
, he gets himself into a bind
. his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he hasnt something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb fomr his work
. the summer ofthe 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city
. it was the hottest summer on record
. to boot
, new york ' s first serial killer was on the loose
: calling himself the son of sam
, david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area
and frightened the hwole city population
. so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout
, people went berserk
, causing billions of dollars in damage to the city
. the movie ' s focus isnt on a group of twenty
- somethings during tyhat fateful summer
: vinny
( john leguizamo
)
, a club
- hopping
, adultrous hairdresser
, his benevolent wief dionna
( mira sorvino
, looking young
)
, ritchie
( adrian brody
)
, a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect
, a gang ofthe small time mobsters
and a fewd more minor characters
. we follow them through their roller coaster lives
, thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings
. vinny
and dionna ahev marital problems because vinny cheats
and dionna tries to please him
, make him stay faithful to her
. ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more
and more
" eccentric
,
"
and has degenerated to the point of dancing inspite gay night clubs
and making porno films with his girlfriend
. tensions build
and conflicts arise as the anniversary inght of son of sam ' s frist murder looms
; the niht he promises he wiull strike agina
. a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects
. at the top of the list is ritchie
. vinny
, an unwilling part of the said group
, is called upon to set a trap for his freind
. as we watch these proceedings
, some of which are painfully graphic
, the dreaded
" so what
?
" question springs to mind
. from the way this movie is made
, i ' d have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something
,
but as i searched deeper it bacame clear that there is very little there to find
. lee touches on so much
-
- the media
, the 70 ' s punk scene
, the details ofthe the actual killings
, as well as the characters ' very personal dilemmas
-
-
but he doesn ' t bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statment
. all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow
; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable
. too bad summer of sam doesn ' t git any help here
. frankly
, it ' s a bore
, a redundant
and repetitive two hour
and twenty minute film that doesn ' t entertain beyond its first half hour
. there is noone suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders
and little involving drama because the film is too muddled
and its focus too vague
. leguizamo ' s turn as vinnie is annoying
and whiny
. the script makes it clear thgat we ' re supposed to believe that his character is flawed
,
but still a good guy
. you ' d never guess from his performance
. adrian brody
anbd especialy mira sorvino fare better
. sorvino gives a riveting
, touching performance in a banal movie
( i ' m tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane
)
; her character is affecting
and her emotions true
- to
- heart
. brody
, too paints an effective portrait ofthe a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for
. summer of sam has some superficial elements ofthe a good film
: it looks great
, it has a few notable performances
and i suppose it ' s pretty well directed
, in a purely technical way
.
but it ' s also empty
, pretentious
and boring
. like last year ' s the thin red line
, it ' s a movei by a director who doesn ' t know wqat he wants to say
but goes ahead
and says it anyway
