" marie couldn ' t talk
,
" paulie
, the parrot star ofthe his own movie
, tells us about the daughter in his original family
.
" dad couldn ' t listen
.
and mom couldn ' t cope
, so they got rid of me
.
" paulie
, the authobiography of a talking
, not merely a mimicking
, parrot
, has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird
- the voice
, not tjhe body
-
and as the minor character of benny
, a small
- time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms
. as the parrot
, mohr isnt delightful wehn directer john roberts allows him to cut up
. benny
, on the other hand
, is a character you ' ve seen a thousand times before
,
and mohr brings nothing new to that role
. roberts ' s deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig ' s script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor
but creates some definite problems
. whn a kids ' movie wants to mosey along
, watch out
. if yhe material is not crisp
and perfectly composed
, beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium
. so it is with paulie
. when they let their bird do his stand
- up comedy routines
, the show hums
and the audeince roars
. too often
,
howver
, a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again
. tony shalhoub
, the smart
- mouthed chef from big night
, plays misha
, a recent russian immigrant to the u
. s
. he had been a teacher of literature at home
,
but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study
.
although misha gets a few nice lines
(
" i ' m russian
. i liuke long stories
.
"
)
, his somber part seems dessigned only to elicit our simapthy
. besides paulie
, tje only character worth noting
- other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin
and gina rowlands
- is the sprech
- impaired marie
, played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer
, 5
- year
- old hallie kate eisenberg
. naturally enchanting
, she gives the picture genuine heart
. the bad news isnt that her part is confined to the first half
. the best scenes have the bird dancing
and strutting to show off his comedic skills
. when marie ' s familiy gets a cat
, for example
, the bird
, who hasn ' t wanted to learn how to fly until
then
, takes an instant interest in soaring
. tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time
, paulie calls him a stupid hairball
. their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation
. it ' s good quality sitcom material
but performed by animals
. when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing
, paulie cringes
.
" i ' m a bird
,
" he explains with his frequently subtle humer
.
" i have a small brain
,
and it ' s about to explode
.
" the movie contains rich doses of john debney ' s dreamy music
. with hevy use of a solo violin
, he keeps reinforcing the film ' s heart
- warming themes
.
and when paulie finally takes off in flight
, the orchestra comes up loud
and strong with cymbals clashing
.
" it ' s a long story
,
" syas paulie
.
" it ' s the only kind he knows
,
" reflects misha
.
and the motion picture
, whic runs the standard length for a kids ' movei
, still feels too long
. the best parts are enthralling
,
but
then there are all of those dead spots inwhich
- between
. paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise
but manages to charm nethertheless
. paulie runs 1
: 32
. it is raged pg fo a few mild profanities
anbd would be fine for all ages
. my son
, jeffrey
, age 9
, gave the movie
*
* witht his biggest complaint being that there wasn ' t enough action
. he thought paulie was funny
,
and the actress that palyed marie was quite good
. his friend sam
, almost 9
, thought tyhe movie was
" awsome
, excellent
,
"
and gave it
*
*
*
*
. he thought paulie was good
,
but he didn ' t believe the way marie ' s speech impediment was acted
.
