" marie couldn
' t talk
,
" paulie
, the parrot star of his own movie
, tells us about the daughter inaddition his original family
.
" dad couldn
' t listen
.
and mom couldn
' t cope
, so they got rid of me
.
" paulie
, the autobiography of a talking
, not merely a mimicking
, parrot
, has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird
- the voice
, not the body
-
and as the minor character of benny
, a small
- time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms
. as the parrot
, mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up
. benny
, on the other h
and
, is a character ytou
' ve seen a thous
and times before
, anbd mohr brings nothing new to that role
. roberts
' s deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig
' s scirpt lends a subtle sweetness to its humor
but creates some definite problems
. wehn a kids
' movie wants to mosey along
, watch out
. if the material is not crisp
and perfectly composed
, beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium
. so it is wih paulie
. when they let their bird do his st
and
- up comedy routines
, the show hums
and the audience roars
. too often
,
however
, a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again
. tony shalhoub
, the smart
- mouthed chef from big night
, plays misha
, a recent russian inmigrant to the u
. s
. he had been a teacher of literature at home
,
but nowe he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken forthe study
. altough misha gets a few nice lines
(
" i
' m russion
. i like long stories
.
"
)
, his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy
. besides paulie
, the only character worth noting
- other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin annd gina rowl
ands
- is the speech
- impaired marie
, played in a prescious performance by cinematic newcomer
, 5
- yearm
- old hallie kate eisenberg
. naturally enchanting
, she gives the picture genuine heart
. the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half
. the best scenes have the bird dancing
and strutting to sohw off his comedic skills
. when marie
' s family gets a cat
, for example
, the bird
, who hasn
' t wnated to learn how to fly until
then
, takes an instant interest in soaring
. tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time
, paulie calls him a stupid hairball
. their rapid fysical antics add to the humor of the situation
. it
' s good quality sitcom material
but performed by animals
. when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing
, paulie cringes
.
" i
' m a bird
,
" he explains with his frequently subtle humor
.
" i have a small brain
,
and it
' s about to explode
.
" the movei countains rich doses of john debney
' s dreamy music
. with hevy use of a solo violin
, he keeps reinforcing the film
' s heart
- warming themes
.
and when paulie finally takes off in flight
, yhe orchestra comes uv loud
and strong with cymbals clashing
.
" it
' s a long story
,
" sasy paulie
.
" it
' s hte onyl kind he knows
,
" reflects misha
.
and hte motion picture
, hwihc runs the st
andard length for a kids
' movei
, still feels too long
. the best parts are enthralling
,
but
then there are all of those dead spots in
- between
. paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise
but manages to charm nevertheless
. paulie runs 1
: 32
. it is raged pg for a fewd mild profanities
and would be fine for all ages
. my son
, jeffrey
, age 9
, gave the movie
*
* with his biggest complaint being that there wasn
' t enought action
. he throught paulie ws funny
,
and the actress that played marie was quite good
. his friend sam
, almost 9
,
thought the movie was
" awesome
, excellent
,
"
and gave it
*
*
*
*
. he
thought paulie was good
,
but he didn
' t believe the way marie
' s speech impediment was acted
.
