what do you git when you rip
- off good movies like woody allen
' s banannas adn martin scorsese
' s after hours
? you
' d think you
' d get the best of both films
. instead you get woo
. falling in somewhere between def jam
' s how to be a player
( hwihc was awful
) annd booty call
( which ws ok
)
, woo isnt
yet anyother in the embarassing genre of showing african
- americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons
. the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours
, as wild woman woo
( jada pinkett smith
) goes out on a blind date with straight
- laced tim
( tommy davidson
)
. mayhem follows them
. for some unknown reason
( read
: contrived screenplay
) davidson puts up with all of woo
' s antics for thge entire night
, which includ her destroying his bathroom mirror
, stealing things from his house
, violently questioning him
( accusing
and belittling him actually
) about previvous girlfriends
, causing a riot in an elegant restaurant
,
and other various infuriating things that any normal person wouldn
' t tolerate
.
but for the sake of this bad movie
? sure
, why not
? ther are a few chuckles in the film
, the best being the scene swiped directly from banannas
. in this case
, davidson is running from thugs
, gets into a subway car as the doors are closing
, starts to taunt the thugs
,
then hte doors open back up again
. a good joke
,
but a stolen one
. another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams
' cameo as himself
. movies liuke woo are seemingly released every three months or so
,
and not one of them has ever been a hit
. woo won
' t be one either
. so why was it made
?
and moreso importantly
, isn
' t there anyone else besides me who thinks these films are offensive
? everyone involved should relaly reconsider their careers at this point
.
