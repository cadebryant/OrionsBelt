after the recent animated debacles ofthe
,
" a rugrats movie
,
"
and
" a bug
' s life
,
" i am seriously considering raising my highly negitive rating on dreamworks
' other insect film from october
,
" antz
.
" i hated that movei
,
and
yet
, it is so much better than these latest two excursions
.
" a bug
' s life
,
" is the second animated insect film in the last two months
,
and i hoped for tghe best
, considering it ws done in the wonderful sytle of pixar
' s last film
, 1995
' s
" toy story
,
"
but in no way does
,
" a bug
' s life
,
" even remotely match up to that
. flik
( david foley
)
, an ant
, who along with his many comrades
, has tjhe job every year ofthe gathering up the seasonal harvest
, only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers
, led by hopper
( kevin spacey
)
. flik
,
however
, feels all alone
and unwanted in the world
, especially affter he accidentally loses all of their food
,
and the ants are threated by hopper tothe gather up a whole other season
' s load by the time tje last summer leaf falls from the trees
. banished from ant isl
and
, flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out
,
but through a misunderst
anding
, returns with a h
andful of helpless circus bugs
, including a walking stick
( david hyde pierce
)
, a dung beetle
( brad garrett
)
, a gypsy moth
( madeline kahn
)
, a male ladybug
( denis leary
)
,
and a caterpillar
( joe ranft
)
.
" a bug
' s life
,
" has one thing going for it
. onyl one thing
. with its glorious
, bright colors
, the coputer
- generated animation is a spectacle to look at
. the film itself
, unfortunately
, is a lifeless
, unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitment of
,
" toy story
.
" the characters in
,
" a bug
' s life
,
" are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality
, other than tothe st
and around
and recite arbitrary annd thoroughly unfunny one
- liners
. the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes
,
and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout
, annd so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time
- filler
. after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from thsi yera
, i ws beginning to think thast i had simply outgrown them
,
but
then i realized this is just not so
. i still adore almost all of the older disney films
,
and many of the newer ones
, such as 1989
' s
,
" the little mermaid
,
" 1991
' s
,
" beauty
and tghe beast
,
" 1993
' s
,
" the nightmare befor christmas
,
"
and yes
, 1995
' s
,
" toy story
.
" maybe this has just been a bad year for children
' s films
,
and hopefully
, the upcoming
,
" the prince of egypt
,
" will not be a dissappointment
. as for
,
" a bug
' s life
,
" i did not enjoy anything about it
. not the story
, nto the characters
,
and not even the voiceover work
, which was far more lively in
,
" antz
.
"
" a bug
' s life
,
" goes down as yot another failure for disney
,
and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture
,
" i
' ll be home for christmas
.
