a couple of criminals
( mario van peebles
and loretta devine
) move into a rich familiy ' s house in hopes of conning them out ofthe their jewels
.
howver
, someone else steals the jewels before they are able to get to them
. writer mario van peebles delivers a clever script with several unexpected plot twists
,
but directer mario van peebles undermines his pwn high points with haphazard camera work
, editing
and pacing
. it felt as
though the film should have been wrapping up at the hour mark
,
but alas there was still 35 more minutes to go
. daniel baldwin
( i can ' t believe i ' m about to type this
) gives the best performence in the film
, outshining the otehr talented members of the cast
