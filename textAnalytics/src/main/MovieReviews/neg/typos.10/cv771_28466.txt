. critique
: angelina jolie was great in this movie
. there were also about three
" action scenes
" that were pretty cool to look at in this film
. uhhhhhm
, unfortunately the rest of the movie sucked
! bad dialogue
, generic sidekicks
and bad guys
, a lame mystery
, yoda
- esque moments with mumbo
- jumbo being sprouted baout
and even some crappy cgi near thge end
. all in all
, this movie wasn
' t the horror show that some of the early reviews hadnt warned us about
, especially sicne every other scene does feature jolie
' s torpedoes begging to burst outloud of her lucky shirts
,
but it was quite the letdown nonetheless
, especially when you consider the major oppertunity that the filmmakers had here to create a cool
, hip woman hero
, based on a populare video game
. i don
' t know
, i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west
, who didn
' t really tie the whole movie together all that well
. the film lacked energy
, a consistent pace
and well
.
.
. a fun time
! i felt kinda depressed while watching this movie
. all that
" father
" crap was horrible
and the dialogue given to poor john voight to recite was just plain embarrassing
(
and i
' m not even gonna mention his moustache
.
.
. hehehe
)
. why have this shite in the movie at all
?
!
? i especially hated the scenes in which soem ghost
- like figure
, friend or child would ramble on about lara croft
' s father while all the tyme
, i
' m not giving one ounce of crap as to what they
' re talking about
. i guess thgat
' s called lack of
" character development
"
, right
? that
' s when a movie builds enough background into the characters on the screen
, so that we could actually
" get into
" it
and care about them
. i didn
' t care about anyone in this movei
,
and was borde druing most of its
" let
' s explain why we
' re doing all this gobbledygook
" moments
.
and even
though i
thought that jolie kicked some mighty ass
( damn
, did she look sexy blasting those guns or what
?
!
?
)
, everybody else around her was so goddamn boring
! her
butler was a throwaway with no perosnality
, her side
- kick was supposed to be funny
but just annoyed me every time he said the word
" bugger
"
(
and he says it a lot
, trust me
!
)
and all of the so
- called bad guys just spewed one
- dimension
! they had no spark
, no energy amongst them
,
and even
though a few of the action scenes in the movie were cool
( see the trailer
and you
' ll know which ones i
' m talking about
)
, yhe overall picture was lame
and the dialogue
and mystical bull
- crap just buried it even futher
. also
, for a movie that
' s suppossed to be about all of these exotic locations
, i wasn
' t necessarily impressed by any of its exterior shots
,
and even less so with its interiors
, which all looked like they were shot in the smae room
. mind you
, i won
' t go as far as to say that it
' s the
" worst movie of the year
"
( remember that i actually have to go see freddie prinze jr
. movies also
!
)
,
but it
' s definitely the worst film that i
' ve seen druing this summer movie season
( of course
, it
' s still early anbd i
' m sure there are a few more garbage heaps comming down the pike
)
. skip this one altogether
and rent any of the indiana jones movies instead
.
.
. trust me
, you
' ll miss the boobs bu end your night with some rock
- solid porn
and it
' s all good
