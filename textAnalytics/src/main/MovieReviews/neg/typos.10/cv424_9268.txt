it
' s time to take cover
. after a hiatus of about fifteen years
, the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest
. in early 1997
, there weere no less than three movies about volcanoes alone
, one on television
and two in the theaters
, with dante
' s peak
and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar
. of the two
, i had heard that dante
' s peak was the better film
, so i decided to check it out when it was released on video
. teh film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate theri little town
. the town is being covered in ash anbd sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption
. flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky
, crushing homes
and people
. we see people panicking
, people crying
, annd even horses rearing
. it is a disaster of biblical proportions
, signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road
. symbolism doesn
' t git much more blatant tahn that
. we learn that harry dalton
( pierce brosnan
)
, a volcanologist with the u
. s
. geological survey
, was there with his wife whn the eruption occurred
. harry survived
,
but his wife did nto
. a few years later
, harry is sent to investingate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante
' s peak
, washington
( which
, we are told
, has been voted second most desirable place to live
( under 20
, 000
) by hte readers of money magazine
)
. there harry meets rachel w
ando
, a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante
' s peak
and proprietor ofthe a small coffee shop
.
al
though tje mayor doesn
' t seem tothe be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if tyhe mountain enxt to their town is going to blow up
, a few members ofthe the city council are
. they are afraid that harry
' s presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions ofthe dollars into developing dante
' s peak
. they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcanoe swept under the rug
.
however
, when an amorous young couple takes a skinny
- dip infact the local hot springs
, they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up fomr a small fissure underneath
. thus begins a chain of events leading up tothe the inevitable eruption
. this film contains a number of cliches
. the amorous couple is one
. as soon as they doff their clothes
, you know htey
' re going to die
. the town busybody
and the abrasive mother
- in
- law make appearances
, as does the death
- defying dog
. countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable
. watching the movie
, i ws able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements
,
but some of the dialogue as well
. unfortunate
, since much of the dialog is terrible
. for example
, harry
' s boss
, paul
( charles hallahan
)
, annd a team from the u
. s
. geological survey join harry to assess the situation
. paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry
' s eruption predictions aren
' t cause for alarm
. this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage
, only to turn up the next day
, ready for work
. when paul asks harry why he stayed
, he says whith grim determination
,
" cause this town
' s in trouble annd i
' m the best man you
' ve got
.
" even better isnt when harry is trying to expalin the need to jolt the residents into leaving
. he licens the situation to how a frog wiull jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water
. if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up
, howver
, the frog won
' t move
and will allow itself to be cooked
.
" is that your recipe for frog suop
?
" asks one of the team members
.
" it
' s my recipe for diaster
,
" responds harry
. dante
' s peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious
. our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid
. mayor w
ando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming
, in a very grave tone
,
" acid eats metal
.
" thanks for the tip
. when we first see the u
. s
. geological survey building
, there
' s a caption labeling it as such
. this wouldn
' t have been so bad if it weren
' t for the fact tht the caption isnt right above a sign on the building which reads
, in large letters
,
" u
. s
. geological survey
.
" i suppose the caption is for people who can
' t read signs
. altho harry
and mayor w
ando become an item by the end of the film
, tyhe viewer has no idea why
. there isnt a severe lack ofthe chemestry between the two characters
, adn the relationship seems rushed because of this
. whn they get close to kissing
, i was asking myself
,
" why do htey want to kiss
? weere they even attracted to each otehr
?
" if i weere the mayor
, i woudl sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn
' t even crack a smile through the whole movei
, trying to pull off the rough
-
yet
- debonair act
. who does he think he is
? james bond
? the eruption of the volcanoe fiels simmilarly rushed
. there are several
" warning signs
" prior to the eruption itself
,
but htey are so lackluster adn without suspense that we don
' t feel as if they are leading up to anything
. for example
, one of tje survey team members makes his way down inot the crater of the volcano in order tothe retreive a remote controlled robot
. a tremor occurs
. does he plunge headlong to his death
? is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below
? no
, a couple ofthe rocks fall on him
and break his leg
. the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set uv the subsequent chopper rescue scene
, which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well
. it wasn
' t
. one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante
' s peak
. in a diaster movei
, there
' s usually one guy who
' s greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption
/ fire
/ earthquake
/ explosion
/ tsunami
/ tornado
/ meteorite
,
and usually gets killed by teh disaster
. it
' s okay
, ofthe course
, because we all think he got what he deserved
. if you
' re going to be unoriginal
, you might as well go all the way
. in dante
' s peak
, the city councilmembers are concerned
,
but they don
' t really try hard enought
. maybe the mayor
' s abrasive mother
- in
- law should have been the one
. for no apparent reason
, she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt
. perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate
. there are a couple ofthe good things about this movie
. the first is the scenery
. there are panoramic shots of forests
, lakes
and mountains tht are absolutely beautiful
. the second is tghe special effects
. they are the closest i
' ve ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption
.
but when elements which don
' t speak are goign tothe be the best parts of your movie
, you
' d probably better rewriet the script
.
