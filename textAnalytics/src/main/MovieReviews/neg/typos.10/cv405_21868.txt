arnold schwarzenegger hasnt been an icon for action enthusiasts
, since the late 80
' s
,
but lately his films have been very sloppy
and the one
- liners are getting worse
. it
' s hard seing arnold as mr
. freeze in batman annd robin
, especially when he says tons ofthe ice jokes
,
but hey he got 15 million
, what
' s it matter to him
? once again arnold has signed to dont another expensive blockbuster
, that can
' t compare with the likes of hte terminator series
, true lies
and even eraser
. in this so called dark thriller
, the devil
( gabriel byrne
) has come apon earth
, to impregnate a woman
( robin tunney
) which happens eveyr 1000 years
,
and basically destroy the world
,
but apparently god has choosen one man
,
and thast one man isnt jericho cane
( arnold himself
)
. with the help of a trusty sidekick
( kevin pollack
)
, they will stpo at nothing to let the devil take over tjhe world
! parts of this are actually so absurd
, that they would ift right in with dogma
. yes
, the film is that weak
,
but it
' s better thna the other blockbuster right nowe
( sleepy hollow
)
, bu it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film
. anyway
, this definitely doesn
' t seem liuke an arnold movie
. it just wasn
' t the type of film you can see him doing
. sure he gave us a fewd chuckles with his well known one
- liners
,
but he seemed confused as to where his charachter
and the film was going
. it
' s underst
andable
, especially when the endig had to be changed according to some sources
. asside form that
, he still walked thru it
, much like he has in the past faw films
. i
' m sorry tothe say this arnold
but maybe these are teh end of your acation days
. speaking of action
, where ws it in this film
? there ws hardly any explosions or fights
. hte devil made a few places explode
,
but arnold wasn
' t kicking some devil
butt
. the ending was changed to make it more spiritual
, which undoubtedly ruined the film
. i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred
,
but once again i was let down
. i also don
' t know why the film took so long
and cost so much
. there was really no super affects at all
, unless you consider an invisible devil
, who was in it for 5 mintues tops
, worth the overpriced budget
. the budget shoudln have gone into a better script
, where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instade of facing boredom
. it
' s pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought
and made into a movie
. do they even read these things anymore
? it sure doesn
' t seem like it
. thankfully gabriel
' s performance gave some light to this poor film
. when he walks down tyhe street searching for robin tunney
, you can
' t help
but feel that he looked like a devil
. the guy is creepy looking anyway
! when it
' s all over
, you
' re just glad it
' s the end of the movie
. don
' t bother to see this
, if you
' re expecting a solid action flick
, because it
' s neither solid nor doesnt it have action
. it
' s just another movie that we are suckered in tothe seeing
, due to a strategic marketing campaign
. save your money
and see the world is not enough forthe an entertaining experience
.
