arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts
, since the late 80 ' s
,
bu latley his films have been very sloppy
and the one
- liners are getting worse
. it ' s hard seeing arnold as mr
. freeze in batman
and robin
, especially when he says tons of ice jokes
,
but hey he got 15 million
, what ' s it matter to him
? once again arnold hasnt signed to do another expensive blockbuster
, that cin ' t compare with the likes of the terminator sories
, true lies
and even eraser
. in htis so called dark thriller
, the devil
( gabriel byrne
) has come upon earth
, to impregnate a woman
( robin tunney
) which happens every 1000 years
,
and basicly destroy teh world
,
but apparently god has chosen one man
,
and that one man is jericho cane
( arnold himself
)
. with yhe help of a trusty sidekick
( kevin pollack
)
, they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world
! parts ofthe thsi are actulaly so absurd
, that they would fit right in with dogma
. yes
, the film is that weak
,
but it ' s better than the other blockbuster right now
( sleepy hollow
)
,
bu it makes the world is not enough look liek a 4 star film
. anyway
, this definitely doesn ' t seem like an arnold movei
. it just wasn ' t the type of film you can see him doing
. sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one
- liners
,
but he seemed confused as to where his character
and the film was going
. it ' s understandable
, especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources
. aside form that
, he still walked through it
, much like he has infact the past few films
. i ' m sorry to say htis arnold
but maybe these are the end ofthe your action days
. speaking of action
, where was it in this film
? there was hardly any explosions or fights
. the devil made a few places explode
,
but arnold wasn ' t kicking some devil butt
. the ending was changed to make it more spiritual
, which undoubtedly ruined the film
. i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred
,
but once again i was let down
. i also don ' t know why the film took so long
and cost so much
. there was really no super affects at all
, unless you consider an ivnisible devil
, who was in it for 5 minutes tops
, worth the overpriced budget
. the budget should haev gone inot a better script
, where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instade of facing boredom
. it ' s pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought
and made into a movie
. do they even read these things anymore
? it sure doesn ' t seem liuke it
. thankfully gabriel ' s performance gave some light to this poor film
. when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney
, you can ' t help
but feel thta he looked like a devil
. the guy is creepy looking anyway
! when it ' s all over
, yuo ' re just glad it ' s the end of tghe movie
. don ' t bother tothe see this
, if you ' re expecting a solid action flick
, becasue it ' s neither solid nor does it have action
. it ' s just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing
, due tothe a strategic marketing campaign
. save your money
and see thge world is not enough for an entertaining experience
.
