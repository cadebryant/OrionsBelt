instinct is thge kind of movei that inexperienced moviegoers wiull undoubtedly label as
" powerful
" or
" touching
"
. i have a name for it myself
:
" gross
"
. this is the sort of film where somebody st
ands up to a bully
, the bully looks at the
" rebel
" threateningly
, about to hurt him
,
and
then everyone esle whom the bully has heretofore controlled st
ands up too
. how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me
: aren
' t present day moviegoers beyond being
" inspired
" by something like thgat
? this is one example
( there are actually some more in instinct alone
) of filmmakers insulting the audience
' s intelligence
. instinct
' s plot is brimming with potential
: world
- renowned anthropologist ethan powell
( anthony hopkins
) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa
. he was found
and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer
; he murdered tothe african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him
. after committing a few more brutal acts ofthe violence in the airport
, the authorities stick him in a prison
' s
" psychotics ward
"
. assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright
( or so we are told
) young psychiatrist theo caulder
( cuba gooding jr
.
)
. caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career
. of course
(
and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any otehr way
) he starts really caring for powell
and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic adn that he should not be in prison
.
and
then there
' s the inevitable
" heartless meanie
" character
, in the form of donald sutherl
and who plays caulder
' s mentor
. he cares for caulder
but does everything he can tothe discourage him ffrom helping powell
. let
' s get one thing straight
: dr
. theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen
, on screen or off
. any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way
. not good old theo
. no
, he asks purposefully pointed questions anbd when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says
" we need to talk about this right now
.
" htis is a lfaw only in thte sense that it detracts from instinct
' s alraedy dubious credibility
; unfortunately it
' s also teh least of its problems
. director jon turteltaub
, who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above
- par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that
, contrary to what this movei
' s promotion would have you believe
, it has much mroe in common witht patch adams than with the silence of the lambs
. it
' s nto the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes
( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that
)
but the kind that brings vomit uv your esophagus
( excuse the graphic depiction
)
. it aims to
" inspire
" rather than to touch hearts
. as yoda would say
, inspire it does not
. it is the ultimate sign ofthe futility when a screenwriter
( tjhe very experienced gerald di pego
) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie
' s story
. indeed
, somewhere in the beginning of instinct
, one of the charachters actually reads aloud the film
' s plot to anohter character
. this
, like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review
, is a horrid insult to our intelligence
. i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub
and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation
. i thikn that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors
,
and he chews the scenery inthe this movie
, brilliant as ever
. oscar winner cuba gooding jr
. onthe the other h
and is dreadful
. his performance is at least part of what makes his charater seem so incapable of being a shrink
. i liked the guy infact jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets bu here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling
. i love animals
, anbd instinct
' s prominent save the gorillas
/ live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with
.
however this movie
' s execution is completely unacceptable
. tone down the violence
and this will be a chick flick
