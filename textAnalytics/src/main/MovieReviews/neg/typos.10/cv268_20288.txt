as you should know
, this summer has been less than memorable
. with a total of 4 decent films
, it
' s not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing
. with that said
, you can pretty much predict what my opinion on
" the 13th warrior
" will be
. the film is based on the michael crichton
" eaters ofthe the dead
"
, inthe which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his ocuntry for looking at a wife of a king
. after tarveling fo many monthes
, he comes across a gang of norsemen
, who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel inwhich the fog
. so
, they start picking men
,
and are left without 1
, thus ahmed is choosen
. so far it sounds interesting right
? nto when all of this tkaes palce in 15 mintues
. after that
, they basically run around killing
. that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film
, because once your stroy is introduced
, yuo hvae the rest of the film to start developing it
. obviously that
' s not teh case here
. even if yuo are going into tjhe film expecting an action packed adventure
, you will be disappointed
. since all the action takes place in fog
, it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances
,
and to poor camera work
. can
' t the camera men sit still
? i
' d liek to actually watch a film in focus
,
but again
, htey failed to deliver that as well
. thge film moves on
and on until thge point
, where you can care less about anything
but the popcorn you
' re eating
. with corny dialogue
, that the characters laugh at for some odd reason
, a script that goes nowhere
, dull action sequences
, a predictable ending
,
and worst of all weak characters
, there
' s basically nothing to like here
, except for maybe the set designs
. that
' s the only thign that honestly caught my interest
. when i heard that john mctiernan
, the director
, wanted his name kept out of the project
, that made me wonder why
? well now i know
. crichton
' s greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product
, which led tothe a big arguement
. whta
' s ther to argue about anyway
? the film couldn
' t be saved
, no matter how much they spent or casted
. seeing films like the haunting
and big daddy making mone
, i wouldn
' t be surprised to see
" the 13th warrior
" become a hitted
. please dont me a favor
and savve your money at all costs
, or else you will be lost in the fog
, like the film itself
.
