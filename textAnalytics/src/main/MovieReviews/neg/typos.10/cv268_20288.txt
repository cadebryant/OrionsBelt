as you should know
, this summer has been less than memorable
. with a total of 4 decent films
, it ' s not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing
. with that said
, you can pretty much predict what my opinion on
" the 13th warrior
" will be
. the film is based onthe the michael crichton
" eaters of tghe dead
"
, in which ahmed ibn fahdlan isnt banished ffrom his country for looking at a wife of a king
. after tarveling for many months
, he comes accross a gang of norsemen
, who are forced tothe pik 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog
. so
, they start picking men
,
annd are left without 1
, thus ahmed is choosen
. so far it sounds interesting right
? not when all of this takes palce infront 15 minutes
. after that
, they basically run around killing
. that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film
, because once your story is introduced
, you have the rest of the film to start developing it
. obviously that ' s not the case here
. even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure
, you wiull be disapointed
. since all the action takes place in fog
, it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances
,
and to poor camera work
. can ' t the camera men sit still
? i ' d like to actually watch a film infact focus
,
but again
, they failed tothe deliver that as well
. yhe film moves on
adn on until the point
, where yuo can care less about anything
but the popcorn you ' re eating
. iwth corny dialogue
, that the characters laff at for some odd reason
, a script that goes nowhere
, dull action sequences
, a predictable ending
,
and worst of all weak charachters
, there ' s basically nothing to like here
, except for maybe the set designs
. that ' s the only thing that honestly caught my interest
. when i heard that john mctiernan
, the director
, wanted his name kept out of the project
, that made me wonder why
? well now i know
. crichton ' s greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product
, which led to a big arguement
. what ' s there to argue about anyway
? the film couldn ' t be saved
, no matter how much they spent or casted
. seeing films liek the haunting
and big daddy making money
, i wouldn ' t be surprized to see
" the 13th warrior
" become a hit
. please do me a favor
and save your money at all costs
, or else you will be lost in the fog
, like the film itself
.
