,
and slow

- bashes
but also tries to sound like an 80s movie
. they cannot have it both ways
.
" i now pronounce you husb
and
and wife
.
" sure
, they said that in the 1800s
.
" entrepreneur
.
" sure
. every bit of male
- ego
- stroking dialogue that wyatt
' s third wife speaks to him made me sick to listen tothe it
.
" oh
, the script was written by two men
?
"
" no kidding
!
" the movie is torture to sit through
. the scenery is boring
. the fades weere either ackward or cliche or to self important
. can you say poor editing
? everyone looks ugly in this movie
. when you shoot people from under their chins
, they look like they have double chins
. kevin costner has never looked worse
. he should sue
. he looks liek he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost
. dennis quaid is marvelous
. if you have to see this movie just fo his performance
, go into the theatre at the movie
' s halfway mark
. doc holliday
( quaid
' s character
) shows up at about the 90
- minute mark
. gene hackman is vrey good
. is he in thte credits
? i don
' t remember seeing his name
. mare winningham makes the best of a small role as wyatt
' s second wife
. annabeth gish is ogod as wyatt
' s first wife
. i
though that jamie gertz played wyatt
' s thrid wife
,
but i later heard that her name is joanna going
. she looks great
but her dialogue sucks
. she also seems way to young for costner
. costner seems way to old for 90
% of thsi movei
. in his first scene he is supposed to be about 19 years old
. yeah
, right
. catherine o
' hara
and jobeth williams are always ogod
and totally wasted here
. this is the worst movie that i have seen in years
. the lastest action hero was better that this
. go see maverick if you want to see a western
. bullets for dennis quaid
' s performance only
.
