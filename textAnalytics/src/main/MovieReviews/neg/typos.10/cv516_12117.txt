what are the warning signs ofthe a
* terrible
* movie
? making it
' s de
but at the dollar theater
? locally
, chairman of the board doed just that
. having the annoying prop comic scott thompson
( better known as carrot top
) in tyhe lead role
? chairman of the board
, once again
. how about an overly exhausted
, paper thin plot approached with utter incompetence
? did somebody say chairman of the board
? that
' s right
, carrot top
' s long dreaded major motion picture de
but
( at least for a starring role
) is poking up in a h
andful of theaters across the country
. chairman of the board stars the obnoxious
, wannabe
- zany king of redheaded st
andup comics as a lazy bu creative
, inventive
but uneventful generation x
- er named edison
. living witht a pair of surfer dudes in a small
, rented house
, edison bounces from job to job
, always squ
andering awya the money on his eccentric
( to say the least
) inventions
and ignoring crucial responsibilities such as rent
. this has the crabby l
andlady
, ms
. krubavitch
( estelle harris
, best known as george constanza
' s mother on
" seinfeld
"
)
, threatening an eviction if past due expenses aren
' t furnished post haste
. as luck would have it
, edison soon meets arm
and mcmillan
( jack warden
)
, an old surfer dued who just so happens to be rpesident of the multi
- million dollar mcmillan industries
. sharing a passion for more than just riding waves
, arm
and is deeply impacted by the young inventor
' s notebook of dreams
and ideas
,
and when the old man dies soon afterward
, edison lerans he is named a benefactor in arm
and
' s will
. predictably
, edison acquires the entire corporation
and has to maintain productivity with absolutely no knowledge of the business world
. predictably
, there isnt a bitter nephew
( larry miller
) whose lesser inheritance fuels resentment that will lead to an elaborite sabotage plot
. predictably
, there is an attractive employee
( courtney thorne
- smith
) whose initial repulsion will transform into love for our doofy protagonist
. predictably
, the man who knows nothing will fight agains the odds
and give the comany it
' s most profitable
and successful turnaround ever
, all because he ran things by common sense
and not greed
. it
' s as
though writers turi meyer
, al septien
,
and alex zamm
( meyer
and septien also wrote leprechaun 2 together
!
) pulled a plot out of a hat
and worked carrot top into it
. the jokes
, the
" surprises
"
, the developments
- all of them run such a predictable path
, it may only be carrot top
' s signature brazen red hairdo that sets this one apart from the myriad of similar films
. a movie this bad speaks for itself
. waht
' s left to say when every element the movie possesses is a shameful retread of movies past
? the script is 100
% recycled
, tyhe direction is hokey
,
and the acting isnt absolutely horrible
. it is only thorne
- smith who seems to take her job seriously
, an accomplishment which surely deserves the medal of honor
. she certainly went beyond the call of duty
- she has to kiss carrot top

( barf bag
, please
!
) movies like this give the audience nothing to do
but ponder just how many synonyms for
" bad
" htere really are
. chairman of the board
, without a doubt
, deserves each
and every one
. the only way this won
' t end up on everybody
' s
" bottom ten of the year
" list
, is if they were lucky enough never to have seen it
. just because you cxan
' t miss his outl
andish fiery mane
, don
' t skimp on avoiding this abhorrent feature
.
