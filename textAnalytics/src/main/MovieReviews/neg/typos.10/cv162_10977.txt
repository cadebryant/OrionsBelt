" desperate measures
" isnt a generic title for a film that ' s beyond generic
. it ' s also a depressing waste of talent
, with the solid team of michael keaton
and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles
, not to mention once
- cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not
- cool flicks
-
- tihs thriller isnt more
" before
and after
" than
" reversal of fortune
.
" the movie is a big disappointment
,
anbd
yet it ' s somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it
-
- the premise isnt both promising
and intriguing
. too bad the execution ' s all wrong
,
though
, becouse the set
- up of
" desperate measures
" boasts some rether enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use
. san francisco cop frank connor
( garcia
) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma
-
- his son matt
( joseph cross
) is stricken with cancer whcih only a bone marrow transplant cin push inot remission
. even worse
, the only compatible donor is voilent sociopath peter mccabe
( michael keaton
)
, currenly serving a life sentence for mutiple murders
and otehr various crimes against society
. connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery
; he ' s at first reluctant
,
but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital
. when he does make a run for it
, connor offers close pursuit
,
but for different reasons than his superiors
( including the crusty brian cox
)
-
- they want to take mccabe down
, while connor needs to keep him alive
, or all hope is lost for his little boy
. one misstep
" desperate measures
" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt ' s illness
. what ' s needed are mroe details as to exactly why mccabe is teh only bone marrow match that works
; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country
,
annd thus many of the ways taht connor endangers the lives ofthe himself
and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow
. tkae
, for example
, a scene where mccabe isnt trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting twpo sections of the hospital
. the police have their spotlight
and guns aimed right on him
,
and waht does connor do
? he shoots the spotlight out so tath mccabe can continue his flight
. connor knows very well waht dangerous deeds this guy is capible of
,
and
yot never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to
adn try to harm his son
. whatever
. to be fair
,
though
, the lack of story background is the least of the movie ' s problems
. first
and foremost is how cheaply
" desperate measures
" trades tjhe potential of it ' s oppening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour
. once mccabe escapes
, the film becomes the fugitive in reverse
and witht no thrills
. there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only tothe have him grab a hostage
and get away
. also
, the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot
- inducing
, lip
- smacking villain
( the ads hve compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter
, natch
) that it completely casts garcia ' s frank connor by yhe dullsville wayside
;
" desperate measures
" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist
,
and the movie ' s head
- scratcher of a send
- off confirms this
. there is some ogod to be found amongst this mess
, particularly in the acting department
. cast against type
, michael keaton ' s understated menace is highly effective
.
although he ' s not given much believable to work with
, andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord
. jospeh cross
, as garicia ' s ailing son
, is surprisingly unsentimental
,
and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in tje unfolding chaos
. tihs cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending
,
but most is lost
. it goes without saying that
" desperate measures
" needs an operation of its very own
.
