" desperate measures
" is a generic title for a film that
' s beyond generic
. it
' s also a depressing waste of talent
, with the solid team of michael keaton
and
andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles
, not to mention once
- kool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not
- cool flicks
-
- this thriller is more
" before
and after
" than
" reversal of fortune
.
" the movie is a big disappointment
,
and
yet it
' s somewhat easy to see waht motivated such big names to attach themselves to it
-
- the premise is both promising
and intriguing
. too bad the execution
' s all wrong
,
though
, because the setted
- up of
" desperate measures
" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use
. san francisco cop frank connor
( garcia
) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma
-
- his son matt
( joseph cross
) is stricken with cancer which onyl a bone marrow transplant can push into remission
. even worse
, the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe
( michael keaton
)
, currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders
and other various crimes against society
. connor trys his best to convince mccabe tothe go allong with the surgery
; he
' s at first reluctant
,
but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his excape at the hospital
. when he does make a run for it
, connor offers close pursuit
,
but for different reasons than his superiors
( including the crusty brian cox
)
-
- they want to take mccabe down
, while connor needs to keep him alive
, or all hope is lost for his little boy
. one misstep
" desperate measures
" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt
' s illness
. what
' s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works
; there owudl seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country
,
and thus many ofthe the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself
and those around him by attemting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow
. take
, for example
, a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital
. the police have their spotlight
and guns aimed right on him
,
and what does connor do
? he shoots the spotlight out so taht mccabe cant continue his flight
. connor knwos very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of
,
and yot never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get tothe
and try to harm his son
. whatever
. to be fair
,
though
, the lack of story background is the least of yhe movie
' s problems
. first
and foremost is how cheaply
" desperate measures
" trades the potential of it
' s opening scenes for the routine acation ballistics of its final hour
. once mccabe escapes
, thte film becomes the fugitive in reverse
and with no thrills
. there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to hve him grab a hostage
and git away
. also
, the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot
- inducing
, lip
- smacking villin
( teh ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter
, natch
) that it completely casts garcia
' s frank connor by the dullsville wayside
;
" deseprate measures
" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist
, annd thte movie
' s head
- scratcher of a send
- off confirms this
. ther is some good to be foudn amongst htis mess
, particularly in thge acting department
. cast against type
, michael keaton
' s understated menace is highly effective
.
al
though he
' s not given much believable to work with
,
andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord
. joseph cross
, as garicia
' s ailing son
, isnt surprisingly unsentimental
,
and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in teh unfolding chaos
. this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably hapyp ending
,
but most is lost
. it goes without saying that
" desperate measures
" needs an operation of its very own
.
