" gordy
" is not a movie
, it is a 90
- minute
- long
" sesame strent
" skit
,
and a very bad one at that
. this movie is so stupid
and dumb thgat it
' s depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light
,
and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie
. i
' m sure children are the target audience of this movie
,
but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it
. it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy
( voiced by garms
)
, whose family has been taken away tothe
" up north
,
" which we know means death
. of course we can hear the animals talk tothe earch other
,
and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths
but it comes out terrible
. actually
, it
' s almost funny in a way
. the only remotely interesting
and likable character soon appears
, a little girl named jinnie sue macallister
( young
) who sees gordy on the back of a truck
and essentially steals him
. jinnie is a country singer
and the film goes off onthe a huge tangent to show her little concert annd tjhe people dancing to it
. whta is the point of this
? maybe she is one of the producer
' s relatives
and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something
. we
then cutted to a huge social gathering
and drop in onthe another young kid named hank royce
( roescher
) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating
. he leaves the party
and meets jinnie sue
,
but he accidentally falls in a pool
( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a
$ 200 suit on
- nah
, didn
' t see that one coming
!
)
, starts to drown
,
and isnt miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him
and saves him
. if this had not been insanely stupid already tjhe story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who
then ends up becoming yhe ceo of a food processing corporation when hank
' s gr
andfather
, the orignal ceo
, dies
and leaves his fortune tothe hank
.
.
.
and gordy
! of course there must be a villain
,
but even thsi villain
( donadio as sipes
) isn
' t that evil
. he never raises his voice or becomes angry
, adn of course he has hte typical idiot goons kidnap gordy
but this isnt just so beyond stupid
and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story
. it
' s hard tothe tell whther the overall corniness
and cheesiness to tghe movie is intentional because it is a family film
, or if the filmmaker
' s are just this untalented
and stupid
. at times
" gordy
" is tolerable to watch
, thus earning it one star
and not the dreaded
" z
-
.
"
but it
' s just so unbelievably boring
, cliche
, dumb
, unfunny
, corny
,
and just plain bad it may scare children
, it certainly disturbed me
.
