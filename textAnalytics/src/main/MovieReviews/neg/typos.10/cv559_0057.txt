this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset
: the two main characters had beeen involved with the fine television drama st
. elsewhere for several years
,
and i had understood thast the director
/ screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also
. i am sorry to report that the results weere nto up to my expectations
, nor were they satisfactory
. if i had to list a reason why
.
.
.
.
but that would be getting ahead of myself
; besides
, it
' s not immediately clear
, as there are so many problems with tyhe film
. adam arkin plays a grade
- school teacher who is sardonic
, cynical
,
and somewhat abrasive
, bu a good teacher
. he spends his lunches palying basketball by himself on a nearbye court
. one day
, he meets a drifter
( david morse
, who plays jack morrison on st
. elsewhere
) in the park
,
and inveigles him in a game of one
- on
- one basketball
. morse turns out to be good
,
and a friendship slowly develops between the two
, as their respective professions progress on the screen
-
- arkin
' s teaching
,
and morse
' s selling of paper flowers to passing motorists
. so far
, my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue
,
and the constatn intrusion of the musical soundtrack
. good music to be sure
, bu it doesn
' t replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story
-
- it makes the film somewhat minimalistic
, a technique i rarely admire
. suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse
' s introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin
' s
, a woman arkin has long admired from afar
,
but it too reticent to approach
. it appears that she begins to admire morse
( who enjoys here attentions
,
but isn
' t sure what to do about it
-
- she doesn
' t relize that he is a drifter
,
and knows nothing about his past
)
,
and this causes friction between arkin
and almost everyone else
. until
then
, i had onyl a vague dissatisfaction with the film
. the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full
- fledged failure
. the woman
, at least to me
, appeared to be fairly shallow
; i didn
' t relize how shallow until her final scene with arkin
, where she reveals that she hasnt been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse
. somehow
, this is made to appear as if it is arkin
' s fault
, adn it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he
' s gotten such a find of girlfriend
. frankly
, dropping her onthe the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make
; punching her in the mouth not the least
. after this
, the childish confrontation between morse
and arkin at the end seems almost natural
. if i hadnt to summarize a major gripe
, it
' s that this is a story spread too thin
, that creates semi
- likable characters at the outset
,
and
then suddenly jerks them into being 16
- year
- olds at the last moment
. it might be true
- to
- life with some people
;
but that doesn
' t mean
* i
* have to like it
. i don
' t
.
. avoid
.
