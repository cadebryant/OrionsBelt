adam s
andler isn
' t known for appearing in deep
,
thought
- provoking films
,
but he
' s still a really funny guy
. most of his movies are successful not because of the film making behind them
,
but because they let s
andler do what he does best without a stupid plot tothe drown him out
. big daddy is the first film in which the story seems more important thna s
andler
' s comic performance
,
and it
' s a miserable failure
. s
andler plays a thirty
- something loser who gets attached to an orphaned young boy
( played by cole
and dylan sprouse
)
. as one might expect from the synopsis
, director dennis dugan resorts tothe the usual bag of manipulative
and sentimental sequences
, including a repulsive courtroom battle adn a lot of teary scenes in which charactors say
" good
- bye
" tothe one another
; inwhich addition
, there
' s a ridiculous amount of disgusting toilet humor
( urine
and vomit both git more screen time than s
andler himself
)
. there
' s a hilarious running joke featuring a female doctor who previously worked at hooters
,
and the film features passable performances from s
andler
, joey lauren adams
( as the love interest
)
,
and the two young boys
, bu the film on the whole is trite
and disappointingly unfunny
.
