best remembered for his understated performance as dr
. hannibal lecter in michael mann ' s forensics thriller
, manhunter
, scottish character actor brian cox brings something special tothe eveyr movie he works on
. usually playing a bit role in some studio schlock
( he dies halfway through the long kiss goodnight
)
, he ' s only occasionally given something meaty
anbd substantial to do
. if you want to see some brilliant acting
, check outloud his wrok as a dogged police inspector opposite frances mcdormand in ken loach ' s hidden agenda
. cox plays the role ofthe big john harrigan in the disturbing new indie flick l

.
, which lot 47 picked up at sundance when other distributors were scared to budge
. big john feels yhe love that dares not speak its name
,
but he expresses it through seeking out adolescents
and bringing them back to his pad
. what bothered some audiance members was the presentation of big john in an oddly empathetic light
. he ' s an even
- tempered
, funny
, robust ood man who actually listens to the kids ' problems
( as opposed to theri parents
and friends
, both caught up in the high
- wire act of their own confuzled lives
.
) he ' ll have sex
- for

, charming them wiht temptations from the grown
- up world

. i
. e
. stands for long island expressway
, which slices through the strip malls
and middle
- class homes of suburbia
. filmmaker michael cuesta uses it as a
( pretty transparent
) metaphor of dangerous escape forthe his 15
- year old protagonist
, howie
( paul franklin dano
)
. in his opening voice
- over
, howie reveals a morbid preocupation with death on the road
, citing the l
. i
. e
. highway deaths of filmmaker alan j
. pakula
, songwriter harry chapin
,
and his own mother on exit 52
. he ' s both fascinated
and disturbed by the l
. i
. e
.
,
and those feelings are projected onto big john
( who follows howie arund in his bright red car
,
but never makes a move to force the boy to do something he doesn ' t want tothe do
. this makes him much more complex than the usual child molesters seen in movies
-
- he ' s a beast
,
but ashamed of it
.
) l
. i
. e
. would have worked best as a half
- hour short film about howie ' s ill
- advised foray into big john ' s haven
. there is unnecessary padding with howie ' s miserable dad
( bruce altman
) in thge hot seat for a white
- collar crime
, degenerate youngsters who get their kicks from robbing middle
- class houses
,
and some homoerotic shenanigans with wise
- ass gary terrio
( billy kay
)
, a handsome artful dodger
. rather than add to thte themes of suburban ennui
( not that we needed another movie on that subject
)
, these awkward subplots pad out the running time to adequate feature length
. concurrently
, the relationship between howie
anbd big john is evenly paced
and exceptionally well acted
. cox
, sporting a baseball cap
and a faded marine tattoo
, is all bluff
and bluster
. dano is quiet
and at first glance seems so withdrawn as to be transparent
. we ' re so used to child actors whose dramatic choices are broad
and obvious
( calling haley joel
!
)
, it ' s surprising to see one who actually listens throughout any given scene
. the restraint is admirable
.
but l
. i
. e
. ' s screenplay doesn ' t always give them the best material
. when howie reads big john a walt whitman poem
, the moment fiels a bit too precious
. director michael cuesta lingers on an ecstatic reaction shot of big john
, who may as well be hearing glenn gould performing bach ' s goldberg variations
. it ' s too much
. there are also some obvious dramatic contrivances involving big john ' s other boy toy
( walter masterson
)
, jealous over the newbie
. this plot thread predictably leads to voilence
. not content tothe be a haunting
, observational portrait of teen alienation in a royally screwed up world
( like terry zwigoff ' s superb ghost world
)
, cuesta lacks the confidence in his own work tothe end on an ambivalent note
. it ' s typical ofthe unimaginative cinema to wrap things up with a bullet
, sparing the writers from actually haveing tothe come up with a complex
, philosophical note
. in this reguard

and countless other indie films
) share something inaddition common with blockbuster action films
: problems are solved when the obstacle is removed
. how oftenly does real life work this way
? to extend the question
: if a movie is striving for realism
, do dramatic contrivances destroy the illusion
?
