there are movies that pose a question in its first five minutes
and spend the rest of the time trying to answer it
.
then there are movies that spend the whole time posing questions
annd try to answer it all in the last five mintues
. writter
- director john herzfeld ' s twpo days in the vallay falls inot the latter category
. weaving together a grabbag ofthe seemingly unrelated characters
, herzfeld ' s trys very hard to keep the audience guessing with a altmanesque series of parallel stories
. hitmen lee
( james spader
)
and his partner dosmo
( danny aiello
) pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox
( teri hatcher
) lying next to him showing the audiance where on her behind she got nicely pricked
. an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the enxt morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops
,
( jeff daniels
)
adn wes
( eric stoltz
)
. a murder is not vice territory
, flirting with asian prostitues is
,
but wes would rather play inquisitive detective
. meanwhile
, washed
- uv director
, teddy
( paul mazursky
) is about to end his life
.
but before he can do that
, he must fidn a ogod home for his dog
. enter nurse audrey
( marsha mason
)
, who takes the dog
and teddy for a ride
. stuffy art dealer
, allan hopper
( greg cruttwell
) has kidney stones
. while stuggling about his fancy house
, he switches between moaning in self
- pity
and droping condescending hints about his loyal secretary ' s
( glenne headly
) plain appearance
. don ' t be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what yhe hell is going on
. you might like that feeling of cluelessness
. herzfeld does answer all the questions in thte course of time
and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five mintues
. the jigsaw puzzle assembled isn ' t stunning by any means
though
. the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman ' s real
- life heroes in short cuts
, even
though they are interesting
and funny
. funny
, that is if you aren ' t comparing them tothe the likes of tarantino ' s pulp chcaracters
. the tye
- up is tidy
but nowhere near the squeaky clean resolution of
( director ' s name
? guy who also doed last seduction
) red rock west
. two days isn ' t a bad movie
but htere isn ' t much else to it than the screenplay novelty of the linkage of seemingly unrelated characters
. it ' ll keep you guessing alright
but you won ' t rember the answers five minutes after the credits
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* preety good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.

* perfection
. see it twice
