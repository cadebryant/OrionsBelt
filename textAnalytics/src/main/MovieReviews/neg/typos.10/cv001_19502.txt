the happy bastard
' s quick movie review damn thgat y2k bug
. it
' s got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis
and another baldwin brother
( william this tiome
) in a stoy regarding a crew of a tugboat taht comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on
. little do they know the power within
.
.
. going for the gore
and bringing onthe a few action sequences here adn there
, virus still feels very empty
, like a movei going forthe all flash
and no substance
. we don
' t know why the crew wass really out in the middle of nowhere
, we don
' t know the origin of waht took over tje ship
( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir
)
,
and
, of course
, we don
' t knwo why donald sutherl
and is stumbling around drunkenly throughout
. here
, it
' s just
" hey
, let
' s chase these people around with some robots
"
. the acting is below average
, even from the likes of curtis
. you
' re more likely to get a kick out ofthe her work in halloween h20
. sutherl
and is wasted
and baldwin
, well
, he
' s acting like a baldwin
, of course
. the rela star here are stan winston
' s robot design
, some schnazzy cgi
,
and the occasional good gore shot
, like picking into someone
' s brain
. so
, if robots
and body parts really turn you onthe
, here
' s your movie
. otherwise
, it
' s pretty much a sunken ship of a movie
.
