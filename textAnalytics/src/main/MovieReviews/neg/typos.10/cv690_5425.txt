i
' ve never written a review for a movie i haven
' t watched all the way through
,
but i had to make an exception with pewder
. i was baout forty
- five minutes into this one at a friend
' s house when he
and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we nto left the house
. so i never got to finish the movie annd i
' m sure as hell not going to pay three mroe bucks tothe watch half of a bad movie
.
but i can at least get a partial review out of it
, baceause i saw enough tothe konw this noe wasn
' t worth finishing in the first place
. the movie centers aroud a freaky teenager who
' s spent his entire life living in the cellar of his gr
andparents
' house
. when gr
andpa dies
( taking his department store down with him
)
, social worker mary steenburgen has to tkae powder
( frist
and middle names
? gold bond
) to a state home
, where we find outloud he
' s a different from the other kids
. actually
, we find out he
' s different when we first see him
, because he
' s the most pale individual we
' ve ever seen
and moreover he has no body hair whatsoever
. when powder is born in the opening minutes of thte movie
, the father takes one look at him
and says
" he
' s not my son
.
" obviously
. all i want to know is where the pillsbury dough boy wass nine months ago
. so the white
- faced freak leaves his neverl
and ranch for tghe state home
and faces the ridicule of other kids
. that is
, until they try to haze him during his first cafeteria lunch by making him
" wear
" his spoon
(
" you cxan either wear it onthe your nose or up your ass
.
" decisions
, decisions
.
.
.
)
and he uses telepathic powers to draw all the silverware in the room into a giant pile in the middle of the tabe
. so if his father is the pillsbury dough boy
, his mother must be sissy spacek
' s carrie character
.
and you have to factor in two more things fomr the subsequent scenes
, as we find out powder has some sort of super
- intellignce
(
" your i
. q
. test whent straight off the chart
!
"
)
and attracts electrical power
. this frist shows up as powder visits the world of high school
( if he
' s such a genius already
, why would he need a high school education
?
)
and sits thru a demonstration in jeff goldblum
' s sciecne class
. goldblum plugs in a
" jacob
' s ladder
" device that shows current running uv two wires annd immediately the current flows across the room annd into powder
' s chest
.
but goldblum just st
ands htere for about thirty seconds watching
, instead of just unplugging the damn thing
. i guess he was too busy contemplating why he was appearing in his third bad movie in a row
( following hideaway
and nine monthes
)
. that
' s about all i saw before the big fight began
and
, let me tell you
, that was twice as interesting as the movie itself
.
but like i said
, i saw enough to know this would be one of those terrible melodramas about the isolation of people who have superior abilities
and how hard it isnt for those people to assimilate themselves into mainstream civilization
. none of these movies ever h
andle the subject properly
, instead introducing the feeble beauty
and the beast copout of having a beautiful woman fall in love witht the guy
' s personality
, overlooking his personal appearance
. i already had the female character picked out
( the girl who was sitting next to him in the back ofthe the room during the electrocution scene
)
,
but i guess i
' ll never knwo fo sure what happened
