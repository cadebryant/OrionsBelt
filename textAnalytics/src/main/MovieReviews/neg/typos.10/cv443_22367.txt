at firt i was intrigued by the strange cast
and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer
, bu that was before i saw the film
. now my view has completely changed
. it
' s time to embrace for impact
, because this is a vyre bumpy ride
. the story begins with tje cast of galaxy quest including
: jason nesmith
( tim allen
)
, alex
ander dane
( alan rickman
)
, gwen demarco
( sigourney weaver
) signing autographs at a convention
. they meet fans who dress up in costumes
, fans who worship the ground they walk on
,
and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris
( robin sachs
)
. of course they are unaware ofthe this untli they actually begin performing their duties
,
and meet the ugly aliens themselves
. thus begins the long adventure to help save tjhe thermians
. the movie plays like a really bad star trek epiode
, in fact it
' s worse
. i don
' t even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof
, because qutie frankly it
' s just not funny
. all the jokes are basically collected observations from tjhe series
. oen such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space
, because noone extra on the tv show ever lives
, as proven in the star trek sories
. creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea
,
but not when htey are used tothe death
. a person can only take so much
. we do nto need tothe be tortured
, especially when you have to pay for it
. it
' s pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful
. it
' s not liuke i expected an oscar worthy performance form him
,
but a few laughs would have been helpful
. speaking ofthe acting
, 2 fine talents were wasted as well
. sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage
, well at least it worked
. it
' s pretty bad wehn the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage
. it just shows ytou how disgraceful yhe film really is
. alan rickman
however was not so lucky
. after his last hit
( dogma
) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess
. it
' s just a shame tothe see talented actors
and actresses throw their ability away
. whn the film couldn
' t get any worse
, thankfully some nice special effects pop up
. like many big blockbusters
( armageddon
, the haunting to nmae a few
) they rely heavily onthe effects to help boost the film
' s box office results
. times it works
,
but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money
and suffer through this junk
. when will it stop
? i am getting tired of bieng suckered into seeing such trash
. it may look fine
and d
andy
,
but we need to at least have a stroy
. isnt that too much to ask
? obviously it is
. when galaxy quest finally ends
, it literally crash l
ands
. aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light
and magic
, it
' s an embarrasment to the cast
,
and it
' s embarrassing to hte scienec fiction genre
. it
' s not the least bit fun
, nor was it entertaining
. the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity
and beyond
.
