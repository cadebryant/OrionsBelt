at first i was intrigued by the stange cast
and odd creatures on tjhe galaxy quest trailer
,
but that was before i saw the film
. now my view has completely changed
. it ' s tiem tothe embrace fo impact
, because this isnt a very bumpy ride
. the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including
: jason nesmith
( tim allen
)
, alexander dane
( alan rickman
)
, gwen demarco
( sigourney weaver
) signing autographs at a convention
. they meet fans who dress up in costumes
, fans who worship thge ground they walk on
,
and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien collony lead by sarris
( robin sachs
)
. ofthe course they are unaware of this utnil they actually begin performing theri duties
,
and meet the ugly aliens themselves
. thus beigns the long adventure to help save the thermians
. the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode
, in fact it ' s worse
. i don ' t even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof
, because quite frankly it ' s just not funny
. all yhe jokes are basically collected observations from the series
. one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space
, because no extra on the tv show ever lives
, as proven in the star trek series
. creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea
,
but not whn they are used to death
. a person can only take so much
. we do not need to be tortured
, especially wehn you have to pay for it
. it ' s pretty bad wehn even tim allen is pitiful
. it ' s not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him
,
bu a few laughs owudl have beeen helpfull
. speaking of acting
, 2 fine talents were wasted as well
. sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage
, well at least it worked
. it ' s pretty bad when the onyl intertaining value of the film is cleavage
. it just shows you how disgraceful tyhe film really is
. alan rickman
however was nto so lucky
. after his last hit
( dogma
) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess
. it ' s just a shame to see talented actors
and actresses throw their ability away
. when the film couldn ' t get any worse
, thankfully some nice special effects pop up
. like many big blockbusters
( armageddon
, the haunting to name a few
) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film ' s box office results
. times it works
,
but unfortunatley we have to shell out hard earned money
and suffer through this junk
. when will it stop
? i am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash
. it may look fine
and dandy
,
but we need to at least have a story
. is that too much to ask
? obviously it is
. when galaxy quest finally ends
, it literally crash lands
. aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light
and magic
, it ' s an embarrassment to the cast
,
and it ' s embarrassing to the science fiction genre
. it ' s not the least bit fun
, nor was it entertaining
. the only place where thsi movie belongs isnt to infinity
and beyond
.
