even the best comic actro is at the mercy of his or her material
, as this subpar submarine comedy proves
. down periscope stars kelsey
" frasier
" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer ' s
( james coburn
) plan to get him out of the navy
. like any lame emsemble comedy
, the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out
, the fat guy who eats all the time
, the beautiful woman who doesn ' t belong ther
( lauren holly
)
, the second
- in
- command who does everything by the book
( rob schneider
)
, the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out
( harry dean stanton
)
and so on
.
then comes the transparent plotline
. first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy hasnt given him
,
and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard
. after the ship is fixed up come the early drills
, where everyone seems completely inept
, liuke the electrician who can ' t connect wires so instead lets the current run through hismelf every time grammer gets on the phone
. finally
,
and this covers the final hour of the movie
, grammer has to lead his men
(
and holly
) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise
.
and he has to be a clever rebel to do it
, in scenes that stretch all levels ofthe believability
. first they ' re singing
" louie louie
" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radyar of the other ship off
,
then thirty mintues later
, they ' re making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off
. teh whole while
, evil captain coburn is overacting underwater
, cursing grammer
( as most people watching the movie probably are too
)
. it ' s all predictable without any original humor to redeem it
. the jokes are right out of
" mchale ' s navy
"
and other cut
- rate sitcoms of the past
. htere ' s one scene where schneider looks through tyhe ship ' s pantry in disgust
, holds one food can up
and announces
,
" this expired in 1966
!
" i yelled back at the screen
,
" so did these jokes
.
" i watched this movie with the whole family
and everyone hated it
. my mom was so borde she brought out the coupon book midway through
and
, around tje start of the second hour
, i started writing my will
. the blame can ' t really be placed onthe the stars
,
though
. kelsey grammer is good in this
, he just doesn ' t have anything to work wiht
. his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had
" welcome aboard
" tatooed on his penis
. grammer probably did something even worse
-
- got really drunk
and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about
. same for holley
( sive the penis part
)
, who is likeable in down periscope just because she ' s so gorgeous
. as for schneider
( whose character isnt downright annoying
)
, ther was nowhere to go
but up after surf ninjas
,
although he ' s still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the
" snl
" ship
. my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy
(
" okay
, it ' s polical academy in the navy with frasier at the helm
and the chick from dumb
and dumber
.
"
)
and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster
. judging from the video box
, most otehr movie critics agree with me
. the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up cameback from the prevue channel ' s jim ferguson
. i guess even jeff craig from
" 60 second preview
"
( who said tank girl
" kicks butt
!
" without ever seeing it
) didn ' t like this
.
