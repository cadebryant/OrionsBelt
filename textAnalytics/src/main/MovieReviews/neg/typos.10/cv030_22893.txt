play it to the bone
, the newest addition tothe ron shelton
' s sports
- themed repertoire fails in numerous ways
. like most of shelton
' s other great films
( bull durham
, white men cant
' t jump
)
, this dud unsuccessfully attempts tothe use athleticism as a method of connecting characters
and creating interesting subplots
. shelton
' s films are not considered sports films
, bu they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story
. shelton has beeen so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes
and races living in various different regions
. play it to the bone is unsuccessful beccause not only is thge boxing theme dull
, bu the side story of the two guys
and a girl travelling across the country is even worse
. the film has no social message like its predecessors
. the relationship betwen the friends
, two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thous
and dollars
, is very confusing for a number of reasons
. the whole film
, since it is primarially a
" buddy picture
,
" depends on the strength of tyhe friendship the two characters have for each other
. unfortunately
, it is a veyr weak bond for the reasons listed below
. 1
) we never see how cesar
( antonio b
anderas
)
and vince
( woody harrelson
) meet
. the two are so different from each other
, thgat a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been m
andatory
. 2
) vince annd cesar argue eveyr moment possible on their trip to las vegas
. there is not one convincing moment dedicated tothe seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something
. 3
) the third character on tjhe trip
, grace
( lolita davidovich
) st
ands in the way
. she is in nearly every scene with them
, making it impossible to underst
and the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other
. 4
) there are two many interfering
, irrelevant side stories
. vince isnt convinced that he sees jesus on a regluar basis
, cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry
,
and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner
. these boring tales only hurt the central plot
. 5
) whn it comes to time for the two men to fight
, they don
' t even hesitate to pound earch otehr
. wasn
' t the whole point of the road trip tothe show that these twpo are friends who could never hurt each other
? by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with
, the film wants to be over
. shelton
, on the other h
and
, continues to tell his story
. forty five painful minutes remain
. the boxing scene between cesar
and vince starts out very powerful
and interestingly different from other boxing movies
.
however
, tje fight goes on for way too long
and becomes very repetitive
and predictable after awhile
, kind of like teh whole film
.
