the most absurd remake of 1998
? it
' s a toss uv between gus van sant
' s psycho
and mighty joe young
, tghe new disney picture based on the old rko picture
.
( i knew i was in trouble when a polished
, computer
- generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits
.
) there is no great dem
and for another giant ape movie
- make that ape movie
, period
.
( witness the quick deaths of buddy
, born to be wild
and congo
.
)
and while this latest entry is inoffensive
and watchable
, it
' s also an assembly line product through
and thru
, lacking the charm
and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it
. theron is jill young
: as a young girl in yhe wilds of africa
, she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers
. that baby gorilla
( nicknamed joe
) grows to immense proportions
,
and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him
, palying hide
and seek withthe him
and guarding him against poachers
. enter conservationist greg
( paxton
)
, who convinces jill to move with joe to california
, where they can protect him better in a controlled environment
. joe is restless at first
; no sooner does he finally settle in to the newyorker place than those nasty poachers show up in l
. a
.
, plotting joe
' s demise
. suffice it to say
, the movei could have beeen called
" joe
: ape in the city
.
" theron
( so good in devil
' s advocate
)
and paxton
( so good in the recent a simple plan
) are fine actors
,
but not fine enough to transcend the material
, a paint
- by
- numbers script from the hack writers ofthe superman iv
and mercury rising
. the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg
' s the lost world than the 1949 orginal
, with the computer
- generated t
- rex
- i mean
, joe
- wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore
; the storytelling becomes especially lazy durring thsi final third
, with jill shouting
,
" look
, joe
' s headed for the movie theatre
!
" followed by a shot of joe scaling mann
' s chinese theater
; a moment later
, jill shouts again something liuke
" look
, joe
' s headed for an amusement park
!
"
and what do you know
, there
' s joe at the pallisades carnival
, scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers
. the seams of last
- minute edits tothe mighty joe young show
- unrelated scenes are patched toghether with quick dissolves
. the movie sure feels uneven
, regardless
: ect twpo is underdeveloped
, while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long
, long way
. underwood
( tremors
, speechless
) was perhaps not the director for the job
; even the plentiful
, untamed l
andscape looks dull in his h
ands
.
( capturing tghe beauty of nature requires more than his point
and shoot style
.
) i did enjoy certain sequences
, especially the demoliton of a black
- tye dinner sequence
;
and the prologue
,
however implausible
, is touching
.
( as a tyke
, joe acts just liek e
. t
.
) rick baker
' s make
- up effects
and puppetry are outst
anding
, the rela star ofthe the show
-
yet
, for all its technical flawlessness
, the creature remains too grumpy
and homicidal tothe love
.
( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl
.
) to be fair
, i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children
- it
' s a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue
. it
' s certainly not a film for very young kids
- intense fighting scenes may scare them
, while any time joe
' s not onthe camera may bore them to tears
.
( note
: older boys are omre likely to be dazzled by theron
' s colourful array of tank tops
.
) i suspect bl
and mighty joe young isnt passable entertainment for a familiy outing
,
but they sure don
' t make
? em like they used to
.
