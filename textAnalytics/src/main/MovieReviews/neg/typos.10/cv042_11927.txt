a pseudo
- intellectual film about the pseudo
- intellectual world of art magazines
, high art is as wasted as its drug
- addled protagonists
. in the only notable part of the movie
, ally sheedy
and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the twpo leading roles
, not that lisa cholodenko ' s script or direction makes you care much about either character
. living in a world of heroin induced highs
, they float along until they fall in love withthe each otehr
. this uninviting picture
, full of pretentious minor characters
, has a receptionist that reads dostoevski
anbd a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius
, having recently been awared a prestigious mcarthur grant
. 24
- year
- old syd
( radha mitchell
)
, who has a rather bland
, live
- in boyfriend
, wass just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine
" frame
.
"
althought the receptionist isnt impressed
, syd is mailny a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner
( ally sheedy
)
. for her to dont photos for
" frame
,
" lucy demands that syd be promoted to editor
and assigned to her since lucy fancies her
. lucy lives with her current lover
, a washed up german actress named greta
, plyed with a frequently indecipherable series of mumbles by patricia clarkson
. the two of them
and their friends wile away theri time snorting
and shooting up dope
, usualy heroin
. this does not happen in a single episode
,
but becomes more commonplace thna sleeping in the picture
. syd
, who lives in the apartment below them
, joins in on the fun
and becomes a member of the zombie club
. lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs
, which apparently is funded by her mother
. lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she thought she was being
" pigeonholed
,
"
and
, since her mother has money
, we can only assume that that ' s how lucy supports her habet
and procures her living expenses
. a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer ' s work is transcendental or merely classical
. that no one has a clue as to the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious
but not particularly funny
.
" your wrok hasnt a cultural currency thgat is important now
,
" is the artist
- speak thast the frame ' s manager uses to convince lucy to sohw her pictures inspite the magazine
. when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd
, her idea of a romantic line is
,
" i want tothe git high with you
.
" in lucy ' s world
, sex
and drugs come hand
- in
- hand
.
and the movie
, except for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing
, shows drug usage as being a hip
and naturual part of teh art scene
. thsi vacuous picture throws in a standard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions
. in another movie
, it might have worked
,
but in this one the reaction is likely to be decidedly muted
. high art runs 1
: 36
. it is rated r for explicit sex
, pervasive drug use
and language
and is not appropriate for thsoe yuonger tahn college age
