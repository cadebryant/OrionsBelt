a pseudo
- intellectual film about the pseudo
- intelectual world of art magazines
, high art is as wasted as its drug
- addled protaganists
. in the only notable part of the movie
, ally sheedy
and radha mitchell deliver nice performances in the two leading roles
, not thgat lisa cholodenko
' s script or direction makes you care much about either character
. living in a world of heroin induced highs
, they float along until they fall in love with eahc other
. this uninviting picture
, full of pretentious minor characters
, hasnt a receptionist that reads dostoevski
and a woman in the restroom line who is a certified genius
, having recently been awarded a prestigious mcarthur grant
. 24
- year
- old syd
( radha mitchell
)
, who has a rather bl
and
, live
- in boyfriend
, was just promoted to assistant editor at the artistic photography magazine
" frame
.
" altough the receptionist is impressed
, syd is mainly a gofer for her boss until she meets famous photographer lucy berliner
( ally sheedy
)
. for her to dont photos for
" frame
,
" lucy dem
ands that syd be promoted to editor
and assigned to her since lucy fancies her
. lucy lives with her current lover
, a washed up german actress named greta
, played with a frequently indecipherable serieses of mumbles by patricia clarkson
. the two of them
and thier friends wile away their time snorting
and shooting up dope
, usually heroin
. thsi does not happen in a single episode
,
but becomes more commonplace than sleeping in the picture
. syd
, who lives in the apartment below them
, joins in on the fun
and becomes a member of the zombie club
. lucy seems pretty happy with her life of drugs
, which apparently is funded by her mother
. lucy quit working professionally 10 years ago since she
thought she was being
" pigeonholed
,
"
and
, since her mother has mnoey
, we can only assume that that
' s how lucy supports her habit
and procures her living expenses
. a typical scene has the editors arguing about whether a potential photographer
' s work is transcendental or merely classical
. that no one has a clue as tothe the dogma they are spouting becomes obvious
but not particularly funny
.
" your wrok has a cultural currency that is important now
,
" is tjhe artist
- speak thta the frame
' s manager uses to convince lucy to show her pictures in the magazine
. when the big scene comes in which lucy puts the moves on syd
, her idea of a romantic line is
,
" i want tothe get high with you
.
" in lucy
' s world
, sex
and drugs come h
and
- in
- h
and
.
and the movie
, exept for the obligatory scene of someone almost overdosing
, shows drug usage as being a hip
and natural part ofthe the art scene
. this vacuous picture throws in a st
andard downer ending in an attempt to manipulate our emotions
. in another movie
, it might have worked
,
but in this one teh reaction is likely to be decidedly muted
. high art runs 1
: 36
. it is rated r for explicit sex
, pervasive drug use
and laguage
and is not appropriate for thsoe younger than college age
.
