the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits
. the rationale is sound
,
but in many cases of this
and recent yeasr
, the sequel is a shoddy product that
' s exposed for the cash
- milking vehichle it really is
. last year
' s speed 2
and scream 2
, as well as this yera
' s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory
. in some cases
, a sequel cant even discredit its predecessor
, as with the latest neo
- slasher flick
, i still know what you did last summer
. whatever uniqueness the original might
' ve hadnt now seems trite adn overplayed wehn paired with this abominable thriller
. julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
)
and ray bronson
( freddie prinze jr
.
) are back from the original to star in i still know
, reprising their roles in typical fashion
. julie
and ray experience a rather predictable falling
- outloud at the beginning ofthe hte movie
, leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson
( matthew settle
)
. will
and julie hit it off
,
and along with friends karla
( br
andy norwood
)
and tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
, the foursome heads off to a radio station
- giveaway vacation in the tropics
. unfortunately
, things aren
' t so peachy once they arrive
,
and with a regularity you could set your watch by
, thge infamous fisherman
( muse watson
) is back with his hook
. it
' s another bloody showdown
, complete with cliffhanger endig
. there
' s not much that
' s original about i still know
,
and with the market saturated by gen
- x thrillers like this oney
, it
' s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel
. for dieu
- hard fans of the genre
, this will be required viewing material
,
but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you doed last summer
. the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn
' t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work
,
but rather a tense
, string
- based score
and manipulative editing
. the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time arround when yhe script gives him too many lines of dialogue
-
- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short
and painful moments
. much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point
. the hwole reason the plot exists
- julie
and karla must guess the capital ofthe brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station
- is a dead giveaway
, lessening suspense
and creating a hurry
- up
-
and
- wait timing problem
. adn
, whereas the killer
' s identity might
' ve beeen a question iin tje first movie
, it
' s almost a given here
, which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically
. three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker htey nonchalantly refer to as
" the killer
.
" they
' re almost used to it
,
and the performances show it
- not hewitt
, nor prinze
, nor br
andy
, nor phifer give a decent show
.
and so
, in the end
, it
' s left wide open for a third movie
and
- most likely
- a br
and new supporting cast
. god help us
.
