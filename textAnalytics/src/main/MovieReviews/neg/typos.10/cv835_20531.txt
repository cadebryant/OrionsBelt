under any other circumstances
, i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in tihs particular review
.
however
, in order to fully explain exactlly how
and why this movie is so awful
, a minute dissection of the ending is necessary
. even
though i will not reveal the details of the lsat scenes
, do procede at your own risk
. tghe movie opens
( qutie poorly
, i might add
) as child psychologist malcolm crowe
( bruce willis
, looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene
)
and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm
' s past patients
. distraught
, the sucidial man
( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg
) shoots malcolm
and
then turns the gun on himselv
. cutted to the
" next fall
"
, as we find tghe good doctor quietly observing his latest case
, a trouble young man named cole
( haley joel osment
, one of the only child actors in a while i didn
' t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt intrument
)
. after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences
, we learn that cole has
" the sixth sense
"
, the gift of being able tothe communicate with the dead
.
and htis
, as they say
, is where yhe healing begins
. the sixth sense
and its unexpected popularaty is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film
( one of roger ebert
' s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of
" siskel
and ebert
"
)
.
al
though i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thous
ands of patrons
, i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise
; i
' ve always been a sucker for surprise endings
( my favorite movie is the usual suspects
)
and rarley dislike a film that sports oen
. here
, usance i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film
' s conclusion
, the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its endig
( something i
' ve fallen victim tothe in the past
) ws eliminated
.
and indeed
, my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment
. stripped of the element of surprise
, the film was put to the task of showing what it really had
, instade of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion
. after seeing its true colors
, i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is
, despite what the many champions of the movie may say
, void of any real power
. it
' s a neat concept
,
but not one that justifies being made into a feature
- length movie
. inwhich fatc
, the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude tothe the supposedly earth
- shattering revelation that is
yet to come
.
and when the final moments do come
, it
' s a huge letdown
; the end makes no sense at all
. it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude
and is completely idiotic on a fundamental
and very rare level
. i won
' t go into any details
,
but suffice to say that
, as far as i can tell
, it negates to rest of the movie tothe such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder
. now
, inaddition all fairness
, i cannot say for sure tht i would have guessed the ending
(
however stupid it may be
) had it not been revealed tothe me before h
and
.
however
, i fiel very confident that i
, as well as anyone who had seen a few
" twilight zone
" episodes
, would have seen it coming a mile away
. the fact that movie
- goers nation wide are surprised by thge endig still has me stumped
. ironically
, tothe fully appreciate the best scene
( that of cole
and malcolm attending a little girl
' s funeral
)
, the viewer is required tothe be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy
. i wouldn
' t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn
' t
, by pure dumb luck
, caught
" dateline nbc
" the other week wehn they did a feature story on it
. despite being blessed wtih some really amazing cinematography
and a brauva performence from osment
( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace
?
)
, in the end
, the sixth sense isnt too chalk
- full of contradictions
and just isn
' t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation
.
