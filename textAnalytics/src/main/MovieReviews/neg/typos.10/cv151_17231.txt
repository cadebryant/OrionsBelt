" twilight
" would seem very promising
.
however
, the script is tired
and predictable
. it would serve well as a tv
- movei
- of

, possibly with some 1970
' s detective hero reprising his role
. the appeal of the project for its stars
and its director
, robert benton
, is nostalgia
.
" twilight
" wants very much to be a 1940
' s film noir with alan ladd or dick powell
. all of the st
andard tropes are here
: a hard
- boiled p
. i
. among the rich
and beautifull whose glamour hides sinister secrets
, a femme fatale who tempts
and confounds the hero
, shadowy figures shooting from doorways
, dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn
, cops dogging his path
and interfering with his investigation
. the scirpt offers littel originality
,
and co
- authors benton
and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich
? in 1998
. elmer bernstein
' s score is hauntingly melodic anbd could have been drawn note
- for
- note from a vintage noir
. the lead actors try hard
- none of the three has every made less than a full effort
, even when burdened witht a bad script
. they try to invest every line
and gesture with meaning
,
and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters
. harry is fond of jack
but is in love with catherine
. jack isnt dying of cancer anbd is jealous of harry
' s love for catherine
. catherine teases harry
and enjoys his attention
,
but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully
- maintained veneer
.
