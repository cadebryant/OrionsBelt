capsule
: godawful
" comedy
" that
' s amazingly shabby
and cut
- rate
,
and rather bereft of laughs
. i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers
: international man ofthe mystery
. i desparately needed something to cheer me up
, or at least distract me so i could get a clear head
. get smoe perspective
. even dumb movies can do that for me
, sometimes
. i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment
, bu i am certain now thta austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery
. michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five
- minute sketch on saturday night live
and stretched it to thge length of a feature film
, padding it out with toilet jokes
and the sort of props
- stratagically
- positioned
- between
- naked
- actors
-
and
- camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago
. the plot
, what little there is of it
: back in the swinging mod hep sixties
( i don
' t think i
' m doign a disservice to the movie
' s attempted early look
and feel by describing it that way
)
, sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr
. evil
. evil launched himself into orbit
and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later
, when powers was out of the picture
. powers also had himselv frozen
,
and he wakes up to find the ninties a very hard time to deal with
. tje basic gag
, that of powers
' total inability to cope with tjhe nineties
, is not so much exhausted during the course of teh movie as never even really dealt with
. thte bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics
: james bond gags
( of which this movie has no end
, right down to the silly charachter names
)
, inept slapstick
, toilet humor
,
and strategically placed props
.
.
. tje movie
' s amazingly bereft of ideas
, come to think of it
, with a couple of bright exceptions
. one is dr
. evil
' s son
-
- there is a sidesplitting scene where father annd son go to an encounter group
, chaired by carrie fisher
-
-
and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch
( it
' s a visual gag
-
- hard to describe
,
and hard to recommend seeing the movie for
)
. a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected
and thrown onthe the screen for this movie
,
but it
' s desperate rether than clever
. instead of skewering tjhe hwole thing
, it
' s a rather bloodless
and unfunny tri
bute
. myers himself is alsot desperate
: he
' s given an idea to play
, not a character
. plus
, the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy
( albiet
" nineties
"
) agent are a waste ofthe tiem
. i wnated to have the movie end with him trying
yet again to get it on with her
, only to have her deck him oney
. with a couple ofthe exceptions
, the movie misses all of its own best moments
. the movie even looks cheesy
,
and not in a good way
: i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi
- def video or something
, so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes
. the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap
. my definition of comedy is simply
: did it make me laugh
? the fewd times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by tje time i spent cringing
and wanting out
. the most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne
and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson
' s shorts
and sent it sailing
.
