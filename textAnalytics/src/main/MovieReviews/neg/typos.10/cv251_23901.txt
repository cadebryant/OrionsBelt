let me jsut start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling
and have been for fifteen years
. i am nto too fond of ted turner
' s world championship wrestling
,
however
, annd i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight
. the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs
( david arquette
, aptly cast as a ne
andrathal
)
and sean dawkins
( scott caan
) who are so obssessed with professional wrestling tyhat they believe everyting they see on wcw monday nitro is something moreso than a flashy show
. when they finally get to see their hero
, wcw world champion jimmy king
( played by oliver platt
. i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king
)
, he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, in a role originally meant for real
- life wcw president eric bischoff before he ws fired
and rehired six months later
,
and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff
, they will agree with me that tghe role of sinclair had his name written all over it
)
, they embark on a quest tothe find him
and help him get his title back
. whn they find him
, they discover in horror that jimmy king
' s real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv
. king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king
. affter convincing king that they don
' t care that his persona isn
' t rela
, gordie
and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro
, after which sinclair agrees tothe book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title
and his job back in las vegas at wcw
' s pay
- per
- view
. gee
, whiz
, there are so many thnigs wrong with this movie
, i don
' t know where tothe begin
. yes
, i do
.
.
. 1
. the characters of gordie
and sean show you what eric bischoff
, wcw president who
thought up this project
, thinks of wrestling fans
. he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously
. he actually thikns wrestling fans are dumb enough to bleieve this is meant to be taken seriously
. i got news for you
, eric
: nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that
, this is 2000
, you know
, not 1985
! i know he
' ll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn
' t meant to be taken seriously bu it is
, because that
' s how big an ego bischoff has
. 2
. there was a documentary made infact 1998
, wrestling with shadows
, that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation
, vince mcmahon
' s screwing bret
" the hitman
" hart out of the title
. this movie
' s storyline is basically a comic rip
- off of that plot with the poor man
' s wayne
and garth thrown infront
. eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair
,
but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon
,
and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart
. 3
. the movie
' s main wrestler
, jimmy king
, has an english king gimmick
and tghe audience cheered big for him
. no wrestling fan atcually enjoys characters like that in this day
and age
, we want bad asses today
! 4
. why make this a comedy
, instead of an emotional
, rocky
- style drama
? i knwo wrestling isn
' t a sport
,
but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler
and finally makes it infront the end
. 5
. in the movie
, gordie starts up an ill
- fated romance with nitro girl sasha
( tje lovely rose mcgowan
. what she sees inthe that freak marilyn manson i
' ll never underst
and
)
, only to find thyat she has hospitalized king
' s trainer for sinclair
. wouldn
' t it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy
- girl
- for
- the
- bad
- guy cliche
? i hate that
. 6
. last
, bu certainly not least
, there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would hppen
, nor did i laugh once either
. the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie
, for these reasons
: 1
. htey
' re the better promotion
. 2
. they have better
and younger talent
, performers
and wrestlers
. 3
. they give their fans what they wanna
and don
' t treat them like idiots
. 4
. htey
' re winning the ratings
and they
' re the promotion everybody cares about
. 5
. simply put
, they could make a movie a hundred times better
,
and they could do a wrestling movei tje right way
. the only ogod thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end
.
and if i spoiled it for you
, good
, i saved you from wasting seven dollars
.
