- claude van damme movies tend to be
, if nothing else
, a lot ofthe mindless fun
. his latest film
,
" knock off
,
" skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is
, well
, simply mindless
. you cant
' t raelly blame van damme
. no one
, i suspect
, has ever expected
" the muscles from brussels
" to contri
bute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection
and delicate shades of gray
.
and even his sidekick co

,
" saturday night live
" alumnus rob
" makin
' copies
" schneider
, does what
' s expeced ofthe him
,
al
though neither appear to want the role of straight man
. no
, thte problem with the film is its direction
. tyhe first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible
.
.
.
and it goes downhill from there
! five hundred characters
, it seems
, are introduced within the first fifteen minutes
. van damme doesn
' t l
and his first kick until after thirty
-
- too late for most action fans

-
and by the time the hour mark has rolled around
, your jaw will be on your cup holder
and you
' ll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess
. directer hark tsui
, whose previous film was the van damme
/ dennis rodman teamed
" double team
,
" films at such a frenetic pace that it
' s hard to konw waht
' s gogin on
, who
' s on whose side
,
and what hte point of all this is
. faster than yuo can yell
" fruit st
and
!
" we
' re watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme
. wehn schneider starts whacking van damme in the behind with a four
- foot eel while enthusing
" move your beautiful big ass
,
" the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bizarre
. eveyr nowe
and again
" knock off
" will deliver some truly ingenius directorial flourishes
-
- inventive camera shots
and angles
, wild rides down gun silencers
and from the tops of buildings tothe hte sprawling street below
, revealing cut
- ins within the frame
-
-
but they all happen too quickly
,
and within such a furious frame of referenec
, that they
' re wasted
. if only hark could have slowed things down jsut for a minute
. if you
' re interested in tjhe plot
, you
' re better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the onthe
- screen shenanigans
:
" jean
- claude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize the world with
" nanobombs
" hidden in cabbage patch knock
- offs
. maybe
. with paul sorvino
.
" a more accurate summary would be
" jean
- claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large
, blatent coca
- cola product placements
.
" the fact that the film is staged during hong kong
' s lastest days under british urle gets some lip sevice
but doesn
' t figure in at all
. perhpas
" knock off
"
' s most intriguing credit is that ron
and russell mael composed tje frenzied music score
. some of you might remember the mael brothers as the
' 80s synth pop duo sparks
; their contri
butions here are as confused as the accompanying action

" kimono my house
" indeed
! like the cheap jeans
and
" pumma
" sneakers manufactured inspite hong kong
, van damme
' s latest is a real phony
