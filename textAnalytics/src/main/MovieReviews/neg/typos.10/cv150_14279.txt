- claude van damme movies tend to be
, if nothing else
, a lot of mindless fun
. his latest film
,
" knock off
,
" skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is
, well
, simpley mindless
. yuo can ' t realy blame van damme
. no oen
, i suspect
, has ever expected
" the muscles from brussels
" to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection
and delicate shades of gray
.
and even his sidekick co
- star
,
" saturday night live
" alumnus rob
" makin ' copies
" schneider
, does what ' s expected ofthe him
,
although niether appear tothe want the role ofthe straight man
. no
, tyhe problem with the film is its direction
. the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible
.
.
.
annd it goes downhill fomr there
! five hundred characters
, it seems
, are introduced within the frist fifteen minutes
. van damme doesn ' t land his first kick until affter thirty
-
- too late for most action fans
-
-
and by the time the hour mark has rolled around
, your jaw will be on your cup holder
and you ' ll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars onthe htis mess
. director hark tsui
, whose previous film was thte van damme
/ dennis rodman teamed
" double team
,
" films at such a frenetic pace thyat it ' s hard to know whta ' s going on
, who ' s on whose side
,
and what the point of all this is
. faster than you cin yell
" fruit stand
!
" we ' re watching a crazed rickshaw race with schneider being bounced along by an energetic van damme
. whn schneider starts whacking van damme infact the behind with a four
- foot eel while enthusing
" move your beautiful big ass
,
" the movie takes an unprecedented turn to the bazare
. every now
and again
" knock off
" will deliver some truly ingenious directorial flourishes
-
- inventive camera shots
and angles
, wild rides down gun silencers
and from the tops of buildings to the sprawling street below
, revealing cut
- ins within the frame
-
-
but they all happen too quickly
,
and within such a furious frame of reference
, thta they ' re wasted
. if only hark sould have slowed things down just for a minute
. if yuo ' re interested in hte plot
, you ' re better off reading a capsule review than trying to extract any meaning from the on
- screen shenanigans
:
" jean
- claude van damme plays a shady bluejeans manufacturer who uncovers a russian mafia plot to terrorize teh world with
" nanobombs
" hidden in cabbage patch knock
- offs
. maybe
. with paul sorvino
.
" a more accurate summary would be
" jean
- claude van damme bums around hong kong failing to avoid large
, blatant coca
- cola product placements
.
" the fact that the film isnt staged during hong kong ' s lastr days under british rule gets some lip service
but doesn ' t figure in at all
. perhaps
" knock off
" ' s most intriguing credit is that ron
and russell mael composed the frenzied music score
. some of you might remember the mael brothers as the ' 80s synth pop duo sparks
; their contributions here are as confuzled as the accompanying acation
-
-
" kimono my house
" indeed
! like the cheap jeans
and
" pumma
" sneakers manufactured in hong kong
, van damme ' s latest is a real phony
.
