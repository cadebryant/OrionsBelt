capsule
: not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman
& robin
,
but still horribly putrid
, cheesy
and ill
- concieved
. this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons
.
.
. extended review
: you know
, about halfway through this movei
, i realized that if you hacked out everything except the fight scenes
, you ' d have a damn fine 35 minutes or so of flashy
, hong kong style martial arts
. beautifully choreographed by robin shou
, who also plays liu kang
, the fight scenes are both mind
- blowing
and graceful
, acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep
. this is what made the original so fun
,
but unfortunately for the sequal
, we are without the frenetic directorial style of paul anderson
. instead
, they got john r
. leonetti
, the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat
. not a good choice
. while the fight scenes are brutal
and eye
- popping
, the rest of the movei looks like standard made for tv fare
. the acting is sub
- par
, which i could endure if it were not for a
.
) the director ' s style
, b
.
) the special effects
,
& c
.
) the treatment of the story
and charactors
. a
.
) mr
. leonetti should go back to lighting
, in my opinion
. i could say dozens of bad things about him
: he way overuses slow
- motion
, he has no eye for acation
, he can ' t get even mediocre performances out of actors
,
and so onthe
.
but by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping
. apparantly
, everybody can now fly
. hell
, i ' m all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick
and whatnot
,
but not when it happens every few minutes
,
and is done so poorly
. better jumping
and acrobatics has been seen in xena
: warrior princess
. in short
, they should have gotten paul anderson back
. or at least let robin shou direct
.
.
. b
.
) unlike the firt one
, whose sfx were vibrant
and somewhat realistic
, mk
: a ' s special effects are bland
, fake looking
,
and overall just plain bad
. i counted at least half a dozen times that blue
- screening was painfully obvious
. had this movie beeen made in the 80 ' s
, it would have been ground
- breaking
.
but in todya ' s industry
, it doesn ' t even look finished
. c
.
) now for the
_ realy
_ bad parts
. i admit
, i ' m an avid fan of the mortal kombat series
. the games are amusing diversions
, an easy way to work off stress
and anger
. the frist movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride
. this could have been a really cool movie
. it isn ' t
. the writers apparantly deemed it neccessary to lower the target audience from teens to preschoolers
. some of the plot elements are just plain stupid
. how stupid
? take
, for instance
, how our heroes move around
. they use giants spheres the roll around underground
, supposedly at thousands of miles per hour
.
.
. oh boy
.
.
. even worse is the treatment of secondary characters
. blink
and you ' ll miss ' em
. most characters hadnt more depth in the video games
. if you thought batman
& robin was bad about this
, you ain ' t seen nothin '
yet
. a good 75
% of the characters are introduced
, kick somebody arund a bit
,
then either die or are forgotten about
. ther ' s no explanation at all for this
.
and for hte final blasphemy
, the fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly for
, tyhe fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie
, lasted about 3 minutes
adn
then jsut sort of
.
.
. ended
. it almost made me weep
. to sum it all up
, rent it on video
,
and fast
- forward through everything except the fight scenes
.
