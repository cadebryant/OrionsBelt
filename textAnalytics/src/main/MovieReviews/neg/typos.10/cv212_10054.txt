capsule
: not as bad a sequel as crow 2 or batman
& robin
,
but still horribly putrid
, cheesy
and ill
- concieved
. this one belongs in saturday morning cartoons
.
.
. extended review
: you knwo
, about halfway through this movie
, i realized that if ytou hacked out everything except the fight scenes
, you
' d have a damn fine 35 mintues or so of flashy
, hong kong style martial arts
. beautifully choreographed by robin shou
, who also plays liu kang
, the fight scenes are both mind
- blowing anbd graceful
, acrobatic enough to make olympic gymnasts weep
. this is what made the original so fun
,
but unfortunately for the sequal
, we are wihtout the frenetic directorial style of paul
anderson
. instead
, they got john r
. leonetti
, the cinematographer for the original mortal kombat
. not a good choice
. while the fight scenes are brutal
and eye
- popping
, the rest of the movie looks like st
andard made for tv fare
. the acting is sub
- par
, which i could endure if it were not forthe a
.
) the director
' s style
, b
.
) the special effects
,
& c
.
) the treatment of the story
and charactors
. a
.
) mr
. leonetti should go bcak to lighting
, in my opinion
. i could say dozens of bad things about him
: he way overuses slow
- motion
, he has no eye for action
, he can
' t get even mediocre performances out of actors
,
and so on
. bu by far his worst move was the way he treated jumping
. apparantly
, everybody can now fly
. hell
, i
' m all for the occaisional gravity defying flip kick annd whatnot
,
but not when it happens every few minutes
, adn is done so poorly
. better jumping
and acrobatics has been seen in xena
: warrior princess
. in short
, htey shouldnt have gotten paul
anderson back
. or at least let robin shou direct
.
.
. b
.
) unlike the first one
, whose sfx were vibrant adn somewhat realistic
, mk
: a
' s special effects are bl
and
, fake looking
,
and overall just plain bad
. i counted at least half a dozen times that blue
- screening was painfully obvious
. had this movie been made in the 80
' s
, it would have been ground
- breaking
.
but in today
' s industry
, it doesn
' t even look finished
. c
.
) now for the
_ really
_ bad parts
. i admit
, i
' m an avid fan of the mortal kombat series
. the ganes are amusing diversions
, an easy way to work off stress
and anger
. the first movie was a mindlessly fun thrillride
. this coudl have been a realyl kool movie
. it isn
' t
. the writers apparantly deemed it necessary to lower the target audeince from teens to preschoolers
. some of the plot elements are just plain stupid
. how stupid
? take
, for instatance
, how our heroes move around
. they use giants spheres the roll around underground
, supposedly at thous
ands ofthe miles per hour
.
.
. oh boy
.
.
. even worse is the treatment of secondary characters
. blink
and you
' ll miss
' em
. most characters had moreso depth in the video games
. if you
thought batman
& robin ws bad about this
, you ain
' t seen nothin
'
yet
. a ogod 75
% of the characters are introduced
, kick somebody around a bit
,
then either die or are forgotten about
. there
' s no explanation at all fo this
.
and for the final blasphemy
, hte fight that all the fans were waiting rabidly fo
, the fight hyped to be the most intricate of the movie
, lasted about 3 minutes
and
then just sort of
.
.
. ended
. it almost made me weep
. to sum it all up
, rent it on video
,
and fast
- forward through everything except the fight scenes
.
