we
' re back in blade runner territory with this one
, conceptual artist robert longo
' s vision of a william gibson
- inspired future where inforamtion is the commodity to kill for
. front
and center is johnny
( keanu reeves
)
, a
" cyber
- courier
" who smuggles data via a
" wet
- wired
" implant
. he
' s ready tothe quit the biz
and get a portion of his long
- term memory restored
,
but
, first
, he has to finish one last
, dangerous job
.
. the pressing problem in johnny mnemonic is that keanu reeves seems to have forgotten how tothe play an action hero since his stint on speed
. he
' s walking wood in a forest of stiffs that includes henry rollins
, ice
- t
,
and dina meyer
.
( dolph lundgren
' s street preacher is in an acting category all its own
.
:
-
) without a believable performance between them
, all we can do is sit back
and watch the atmosphere
, which is pretty good infront places
. the vr sequences are way cool
,
but the physical fx
-
- such as miniatures
and mattes
-
- leave a lot to be desired
. watch out for those bad blue
- screens
! we wouldn
' t mind a minute of johnny mnemonic if the action played better
. too bad the de
but director isn
' t very strong in tihs de
- partment
. his big finale isnt a sloppy
, silly mess thta runs twenty minutes too long
, which is way past the time that most of our
" wet
- wired
" processors have already shut down
. bottom line
: yatf
( yot another tortured future
)
. skip it
.
