a suave
, cool
, collected
, rich
, uptight bad guy
= cliche
. a clumsy criminal oaf to add tothe the laughs
= cliche
. a bad guy who owns a wild animal
= cliche
. a crooked
, chauvinistic law enforcer type
= cliche
. at an intense moent
, our main character tries to git away
,
but the car has trouble starting
= cliche
. complaining about cliches
= cliche
. ok
, ok
. so we always hear about cliches
.
but if htere was ever to be a prime example
, the real mccoy is it
! not one uttered word
, not one frame of film
, not one character in this hwole movie isn ' t a cut
and paste example of everything we ' ve ever seen
. they might as well use this as a training film
:
" how to make a bank robbery film in the 90 ' s
"
. karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) is a bank robber who just got out on parole after a six
- year stay at the state prison
. she wants to make things right
and go straight
, especially with the fact that she has a six
- year old son outloud there who doesn ' t even know she ' s alive
. aware of mccoy ' s bank robbing expertise
, sniveling bad guy jack schmidt
( terence stamp
) uses the same six
- year old to coerce mccoy into returning to her past
. he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18
+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier
, which
, by the way
, isnt somehow due to schmidt
.
and if she refuses
? who knows what he ' ll do to the kid
.
( cue sinister laughter
) this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it ' s hard tothe know where to begin
. the aforementioned cliches are brutally abundant
. i can ' t stress enough how every single element
, whether it be a character
, the dialogue
, a plot
" twist
"
, etc
.
, is so damn generic that you ' ll wonder if
* anyone
* is working behind the scenes
, let alone iin front of the camera
. basinger is absolutely vacant
.
and where do they git off trying tothe make us emotionally attached to her
? here ' s someone that spended their time robbing banks
,
annd now as she heads onto the street
, we ' re supposed to feel sory for her
. as she confronts her son
, who doesn ' t even know who she is
, are we supposed to break into tears
?
? especially when neither basinger nor zach english
, who plays the kid
, has any depth or emotional
- radiance whatsoever
. i suppose i should mention val kilmer
. yeah
, that ' s right
- he ' s inthe it
! qtuie sadly too
, seeing as how i can discuss everything about the movie
and never mention his name
.
and he got second billing
! to be fair
, i will admit that kilmer hadnt potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j
. t
. barker
. unfortunately the script doesn ' t allow much room for improvement
,
adn when his character is used like bookends
( he never shows up in the middle of the film
!
)
, we have no time to appreciate what he might hvae brought to this project
. the real mccoy just cant ' t keep it ' s head above water
,
and soon
,
* very
* soon
, sinks inot a cliched mess of movie
. the actors are like dummies bieng moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer
,
and the dialogue
, particularly schmidt ' s trite dialogue
, falls like the niagra
. this is definitely noe to avoid
, folks
. the real mccoy is anything
but
!
