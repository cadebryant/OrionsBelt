a suave

= cliche

, our main character trys to get away
,
but the car has trouble starting
= cliche
. complaining about cliches
= cliche
. ok
, ok
. so we always hear about cliches
. bu if ther was ever to be a prime example
, the real mccoy is it
! not one uttered owrd
, not one frame ofthe film
, not one character in this whole movie isn
' t a cut
and paste example of everything we
' ve ever seen
. they might as well use this as a training film
:
" how to make a bank robbery film in the 90
' s
"
. karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) is a bank robber who jsut got outloud on parole after a six
- year stay at tghe state prison
. she wants tothe make things right
and go straight
, especially with the fact that she has a six
- year old son out there who doesn
' t even know she
' s alive
. aware of mccoy
' s bank robbing expertise
, sniveling bad guy jack schmidt
( terence stamp
) uses the same six
- year old to coerce mccoy into retruning tothe her past
. he wants mccoy to pull off an elaborate heist of 18
+ million dollars at the same bank she got caught trying to rob six years earlier
, which
, by the way
, isnt somehow due to schmidt
.
and if she refuses
? who knows what he
' ll do to the kid
.
( cue sinister laughter
) this movie is so pathetically pitiful that it
' s hard to know where to begin
. the aforementioned cliches are brutally abudnant
. i cant
' t stres enough how every single element
, whether it be a chracter
, the dialogue
, a plot
" twist
"
, etc
.
, is so damn generic that you
' ll wonder if
* anyone
* is working behind the scenes
, let alone in front of the camera
. basinger is absolutely vacant
.
and where do they get off trying to make us emotionally attached to her
? here
' s someone that spent their time robbing banks
,
and now as she heads onto the street
, we
' re supposed to feel sorry for her
. as she confronts her son
, who doesn
' t even know who she isnt
, are we suposed to break into tears
?
? especially when neither basinger nor zach english
, who plays the kid
, has any depth or emotional
- radiance whatsoever
. i suppose i should mention val kilmer
. yeah
, that
' s right
- he
' s in it
! quite sadly too
, seing as how i can discuss everything about the movie
and never mention his name
.
and he got second billing
! to be fair
, i will admit that kilmer had potential in his role as the bumbling criminal wannabe j
. t
. barker
. unfortunately the script doesn
' t allow much room for improvement
,
and wehn his carachter is used like bookends
( he never shows up in the middle of the film
!
)
, we have no time tothe appreciate what he might have brought to this project
. the real mccoy jstu can
' t keep it
' s head above water
,
and soon
,
* very
* soon
, sinks into a cliched mess of movie
. the actors are like dummies being moved about by an unenthusiastic puppeteer
,
and the dialogue
, particularly schmidt
' s trite dialogue
, falls like the niagra
. this is definitely one tothe avoid
, folks
. the rela mccoy is anything bu
!
