it seemed like the perfect concept
. what better for the farrelly brothers
, famous for writing
annd directing comedies with offensive subject marter
, than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality
? it ' s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish
: poking fun at something serious
( in this case mental illness
)
, throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh
. jim carrey ' s signed on too
? even better
. the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers ' new film before its opening
, claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
adn so forth
. such a protest seemed like jsut the sort of thing that would
, of course
, onyl add more fuel to the farrelly brothers ' frie
, proving that some people just couldn ' t take a joke
,
and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to
yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
but one thing went wrong
: their movie isn ' t funny
. it ' s not for lack of trying
. the farrellys utilize in
" me
, myself
& irene
" their most high
- concept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who after being dumped by his wife forthe a midget limo driver
, decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside
and never release them
. this
, of course
, means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enough
, charlie ' s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second
, independent personality named hank
, a deep
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster
. this guy isn ' t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he ' s been insulted
, or holding a little girl ' s head underwater because she refused to stop jump
- roping in the street
.
then things start getting lost iin the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted
,
annd the film runs off its tracks
. some have suggested that this isn ' t a problem
, because the farrelly brothers ' brand of humer doesn ' t require plot to work
. they ' re wrong
, of course
: plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy tyhat infused the farrellys ' last effort
, 1996 ' s
" there ' s something about mary
.
"
( 1999 ' s
" outside providence
" was technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers ' ealier film wasn ' t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags
( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe
)
,
but rather because its most outrageous gags weere entirely unexpected
. in
" mary
,
" the farrellys managed several times tothe pull off a neat sleight
- of
- hand trick
: they ' d hve you thikning the story was oging one way
,
then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion
.
" me
, myself
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems tothe have been made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
and saw only the surface grossness
, missing all of the subtle machinations thyat really made it work
. having been produced by the same guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems like an even bigger disappointment
. the brothers pile on the offensive humor
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental illness
,
and all manner of bathroom jokes
.
but they haven ' t come up with a way to make any of it fresh
; most of
" me
, myself
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- the
- numbers
, adolescent comedy
. the plot
, with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who ' s in moreso trouble than anyone knwos
, back to new york
, has an ending that ' s entirely predictable from the get
- go
.
( think charlie
and irene will fall in love
? yeah
, me too
.
) the farrellys
then introduce scores of different characters
,
and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven ' t already expected them to do
, no matter how outrageous their actions might be
. compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing
, this stuff is almost entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious problem
: when gross
- out humor loses its shock value
, it ' s no longer funny
, merely gross
. the jokes that do wrok are milked over
and over until their effectiveness runs dry
. take
, for example
, the subplot involving charlie ' s three black sons
( anthony anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. the incongruity of it all is funny for a hwile
, with three burly black men discussing heigher math in ghetto language
and white
- bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too
- pleasant smile on his face
.
but by the end of the film
, they ' re still doing the same schitck
; it hasn ' t been elevated to another
, funnier levle
,
and it hasn ' t been dropped either
. that ' s too bad
, baceause it ceases to be amusing about halfway through
.
" me
, myself
& irene
" reeks of wasted opportunities
. there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie ' s new personality
,
and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank ' s actions
. this doesn ' t really happen
; nearly every supporting character lerans about charlie ' s condition early on
, so they don ' t have any opportunity to be surprised by it
. the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
and irene pick uv called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
but tghe scirpt doesn ' t go anywhere with it
, instead leaving the thread twisting inwhich the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax
. jim carrey isnt a gifted comedian
, both physically
and vocally
,
but he ' s left wih nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner simmilar to steve martin in
" all of me
.
" it ' s a gerat showcase ofthe flexibility
and split
- second role
- shifting
,
but none of it is terribly funny
. carrey doesn ' t pull any stunts we don ' t expect him to pul
,
and the farrellys ' script doesn ' t give him anything esle to pull
: hte situations in which he must perform the role
- shifting aren ' t set up in any meaningfull way
. perhaps carrey cxan tkae solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better
. zellweger ' s irene is not a strong female lead
; mary infront
" mary
" may have been part adolescent fantasy
,
but she was also intelligent
and strong
- willed
. irene is nothing in particular
, as the film never makes clear whether she ' s ditzy
, clever
, or neither
. as such
, she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only
" sane
" person iin the film
. chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one onot as a corrupt fbi agent
,
annd his character is entirely too straight
- laced for a movei like this
. he
, like the others
, does absolutly nothing unexpected
. after viewing teh shapeless mess taht
" me
, myself
& irene
" eventually dissolved into
, i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves
. maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it
anbd stop being shocked
.
but i don ' t believe it
-
- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style
. if the farrellys are indeed good
, smart filmmakers
(
and i still think they are
)
, they ' ll rebound just fine
. even after that happens
,
though
, i ' ll still consider
" me
, myself
& irene
" to be a high
- caliber misfire
.
