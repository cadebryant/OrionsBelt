it seemed like the perfect concept
. what better for the farrelly brothers
, famous for writing
and directing comedies with offensive subject matter
, than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality
? it
' s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish
: poking fun at something serious
( in this case mental illness
)
, throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh
. jim carrey
' s singed onthe too
? even better
. thte national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints agaisnt the brothers
' new film before its opening
, claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
and so forth
. such a protest seemed like jstu the sort ofthe thing that would
, of course
, only add mroe fuel to the farrelly brothers
' fire
, proving that some people just couldn
' t take a joke
,
and that tjhe farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to
yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
but one thnig whent wrong
: their movie isn
' t funny
. it
' s not for lack of trying
. the farrellys utilize inspite
" me
, myself
& irene
" their most high
- concept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver
, decides to bury all his agresive feelings deep down inside
and never release them
. this
, of course
, means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, making his job as a rhode isl
and state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enough
, charlie
' s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second
, independnet personality named hank
, a deep
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had beeen unable to muster
. this guy isn
' t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he
' s been insulted
, or holding a little girl
' s head underwater because she refused to stop jump
- roping in the strent
.
then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attemted
,
and the film runs off its tracks
. some have suggested thast this isn
' t a problem
, because the farrelly brothers
' br
and ofthe humor doesn
' t require plot to work
. they
' re wrong
, of course
: plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys
' last effort
, 1996
' s
" there
' s something about mary
.
"
( 1999
' s
" outside providence
" was technically an earlier project
.
) the brothers
' earlier film wasn
' t funny mearly because it contained outrageous gags
( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe
)
,
but rether because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected
. in
" mary
,
" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight
- of
- h
and trick
: they
' d have you thinking the story was going one way
,
then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion
.
" me
, myself
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems to have been made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
and saw onyl the surface grossness
, missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work
. having beeen produced by the same guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems like an even bigger disappointment
. the brothers pile on the offensive humor
, taking shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental ilness
,
and all manner of bathroom jokes
.
but they haven
' t come up withthe a way to make any of it fresh
; most of
" me
, myself
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- the
- numbers
, adolescent comedy
. the plot
, with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who
' s in more trouble than anyone knows
, back to new york
, has an ending that
' s entirely predictable from the get
- go
.
( think charlie
and irene will fall in love
? yeah
, me too
.
) the farrellys
then introduce scores of different charactors
,
and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven
' t already expected them to do
, no matter how outrageous their actions might be
. compared tothe the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing
, this stuff is almost entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious problem
: when gross
- out humor loses its shock value
, it
' s no longer funny
, merely gross
. tjhe jokes that do work are milked over
and over until their effectiveness runs dry
. take
, for example
, the subplot involving charlie
' s three black sons
( anthony
anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. the incongruity of it all is funny for a while
, with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language
and white
- bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too
- plesant smile on his face
.
but by the end of the film
, they
' re still doing the same schitck
; it hasn
' t been elevated to another
, funnier level
,
and it hasn
' t been dropped eather
. that
' s too bad
, because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through
.
" me
, myself
& irene
" reeks of wasted opportunities
. there ought to be moreso focus on how other people react to charlie
' s new personality
, adn on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank
' s actions
. this doesn
' t realy happen
; nearly eveyr supporting character learns about charlie
' s condition easly on
, so tehy don
' t have any opportunity to be surprised by it
. the film throws what looks liuke a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
and irene pick up called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
but the script doesn
' t go anyhwere with it
, instead leaving the thread twisting in tghe wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax
. jim carrey is a gifted comedian
, both physically
and vocally
,
but he
' s left with nothing much to do here exept contort himself in a manner similar tothe steve martin in
" all of me
.
" it
' s a great showcase of flexability
and split
- second role
- shifting
,
but none ofthe it is terribly funny
. carrey doesn
' t pul any stunts we don
' t expect him to pull
,
and the farrellys
' script doesn
' t give him anything else to pull
: tje situations in which he must perform the role
- shifting aren
' t set up in any meaningful way
. perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better
. zellweger
' s irene is not a strong female lead
; mary in
" mary
" may have been part adolescent fantasy
,
but she was also intteligent
and strong
- willed
. irene is nothing in particular
, as the film never makes clear whether she
' s ditzy
, clever
, or niether
. as such
, she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only
" sane
" person in tghe film
. chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent
,
and his character is entirely too straight
- laced for a movie like this
. he
, like the others
, does absolutly nothing unexpected
. after viewing the shapeless mess that
" me
, myself
& irene
" eventually dissolved into
, i was stuck wondering whether or nto the farrellys had outsmarted themselves
. maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it
and stpo bieng shocked
.
but i don
' t believe it
-
- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their stlye
. if the farrellys are indeed good
, smart filmmakers
(
and i still think they are
)
, they
' ll rebound jstu fine
. even after that happens
,
though
, i
' ll still consdider
" me
, myself
& irene
" to be a high
- caliber misfire
.
