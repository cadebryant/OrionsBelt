take two old
and dying men
, a lifetime of regrets
, a house full of sins
, a thoroughly despicable man
, enough lies
, insecurities
and other character defects to keep a team of psychiatrists gainfully employed
,
then add a inexplicable meteorological
and anphibian
- based phenomenon
and you will have summed up magnolia
, the newest film from paul thomas anderson
( boogie nights
)
. the movie tells multiple stories
, weaving them toghether
, or overlapping them during the course of its three hour running time
. owudl that the stories weere worth the telling
. earl partridge
( jason robards
, a thousand acres
) is dying of cancer
. bedridden
, in much pain
, it is obvious that his time is growing short
. his much yuonger wief played by julianne moore
( an ideal husband
) is surprised to find herself struggling with his impending death
. having married for money
, she discovers that she has actually fallen in lveo with the old guy
and regrets haveing cheated
and lied
. earl regrets having cheated on his first wife
and estranging himself from his only son
( tom cruise
, eyes wide shut
)
, now a misogynist self
- help guru who teaches men how to
" seduce
and destroy
,
" his sexual
adn vulgar perspective on male
/ female relationships is so over
- the
- top as to be utterly unbelievable
. meanwhile
, jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
, the insider
) is also dying of cancer
. not as physically incapacitated as earl
, jimmy isnt still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a long
- running quiz show which pits adults against children
. the current whiz
- quiz
- kid is stanley spector
( jeremy blackman in his film debut
) who is tired of the pressure of performing
and is willing to call it quits
. on the otehr hand
, quiz kid donnie smith
( william macy
, mystery men
) would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was a
" somebody
.
" his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame whlch stanley is all too eager to relinquish
. jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug
- addict daughter
( melora walters
, boogie nights
) refuses to hvea anything to do witht him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of tje film
. grabing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop
( john c
. reilly
, never been kissed
) even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection
. this dysfunctional gropu carries on for what seems to be an interminable two
- thirds of the movie
.
and
hten it gets worse
, literally raining frogs
. yes
, frogs
. assuming it to be an intended deus
- ex
- machina device
, it is an ineffective oen because it doesn ' t seem to faze the characters much
. oh
, they may step gingerly aroud the splattered frog corpses littering the streets
,
but otherwise
, the frog shower didn ' t seem to change their behavior or pattern of living
( or dying
)
. htere is simpley too much going onthe in thsi movie
adn most of it isnt distasteful to watch
. mr
. anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud
and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue
, a character who apparently rapped a significant clue tothe a plot development which was completely unintelligble
,
and a heavy handed segment of
" historical
" occurances containing ironical twists whlch set up absolutely nothing
. one ofthe the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes
:
" we may be done with the past
,
but the past is not done with us
.
" this is an absolute lie
. god is in yhe forgiveness business
. iin fact
, as we humbly ask for forgiveness
and repent or change our offending mindset
, god ' s word says that he nto only forgives
, he also forgets
.
" i
, even i
, am he tht blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake
,
and will not remember thy sins
.
" isaiah 43
: 25

] the spriritual one who keeps bringing up our unrighteous past is teh same one who wants tothe keep us in a state of condemnation
. don ' t let him
. next time your spiritual adversary reminds you of your past
, take graet pleasure in reminding him of his future
. he hates that
.
