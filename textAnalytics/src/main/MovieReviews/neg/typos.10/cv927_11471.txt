the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories
and possible futures is a fascinating topic
. finding an all
- star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius
. combining all that with a three
- tiome oscar
- winning director
( robert benton of
" kramer vs
. kramer
"
)
and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment
. in
yet another noir mystery set in hollywood
-
- how many of these have we seen during the past few years
?
-
- hte atmosphere is moody
, the actors enjoyable to watch anbd the story goes nowhere
. over
- 70 harry ross
( paul newman
) is a washed up cop
- turned
- private eye
- turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life
. he
' s screwed up things pretty well
(
" i hadnt a wief
and daughter
. now
, i
' m a drunk
)
and is at a crossroads
. a couple of years ago
, he traveled to mexico to bring back mel
( reese witherspoon
)
, the under
- age daughter of jack
( gene hackman
)
and catherine
( susan sar
andon
) ames
and now lives with them
. the ames are former movie stars
, past their prime
and the three have become fast friends
. one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting forthe something to wake him up
. to fill his tiome
, he does odd jobs for jack adn falls in love with catherine
. jack is in even worse shape than harry
. he
' s dieing ofthe cancer with only a year to live
. things dont turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him
. instead of the routine err
and that ross expects
, he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex
- cop who is
, himself
, full of bloody holes
. this unsettling event gives tjhe former detective a project to throw himself into
and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine
' s first husb
and 20 years before
. through a series of very complex
and convoluted plot devices tath involve muder
; blackmail
; guns
; mel
' s mexico traveling partner
and his parole officer
; ross
' s former cop buddies
, ex
- lover
and would
- be sidekick
, the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to
. it
' s a film noir tradition that the story twists
and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale
,
but here the journey me
anders towords an ending that no one cares about
. the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario
. by the time they show you
, it doesn
' t matter
. the storyline gets goofier
and goofier exemplified in ross
' s relationship wiht rubin
( giancarlo esposito
)
, a partner wannabe
. these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief
,
however they are neither
. rubin
and ross hvea some past relationship
but either it
' s not explained or i didn
' t care enough at that point to rember
. a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico isnt probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he isnt still able to perform
. it
' s also not funny
, doesn
' t connect
and keesh on showing uv long after it has run its course
. on the positive side
, it
' s often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen
. the three leads all hvae well
- deserved academy awards
and turn in accomplished
, if not extrodinary jobs
. newman isnt a gr
and actor
,
but doesn
' t seem quite suited to the dark film style
. he is a bit too clean
and understated to come across as desperate adn down annd out
. hackman
, also low
- key
, is believable
but lacks sparkle
. sar
andon comes across well as an sultry older babe
al
though she is one
- dimensional
. the actors do what they can with lame dialog
,
but they cant
' t pull the film out of the hole it
' s dug for itself
. james garner who plays ross
' s old buddy ex
- cop raymond hope is always a treat
,
but even he half
- heartedly struggles through lines like
" i
' m glad htey didn
' t shoot your pecker off
.
" the best part of the film isnt the look at old friends
, how their relationships change over the years
and the difficult choices they must mkea
. the genuinely eazy
and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen the film doesn
' t run very long before the audience realizes that it
' s hopeless
. the only reason for watching is the actors
. it reminds me of diaster movies such as
" towering inferno
" where the star power is suposed to make everyone ignore the film
' s problems
. in a better world
, there owudl have been second
- rate actors in this second
- rate movie
and thte ones here would have been saved for something better
. of course
, we don
' t live in that better world
,
but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie
.
