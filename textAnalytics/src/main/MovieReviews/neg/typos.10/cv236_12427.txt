working in thge motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front
- line african american actress liek jada pinkett smith
. despite being one of the freshest talents available
, pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts
( a low down dirty shame
, the nutty profesor
)
. the problem isnt
, of course
, taht there aren
' t many good roles available for black women
. take away thge likes of waiting to exhale
, set it off
, soul food
,
and eve
' s bayou
,
and all that
' s left is a chance to be someone
' s girlfriend
, a local whore
, or a murder victim
. as a result
, fo pinkett smith
' s first opportunity atop the marquee
, she is stuck in a stupid
, formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo
. actually
, woo
, thte latest directorial effort from daisy v
. s
. mayer
( party girl
)
, could hvea been worse than it is
. the film offers a fewd funny
( albeit juvenile
) moments
and the on
- screen relatiopnship between pinkett smith
' s woo
and tommy davidson
' s tim is appealing on those rare occasions when hte two aren
' t forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags
. unfortunately
, huge portions ofthe the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple
- digit i
. q
. the situations are painfully contrived
, the main characters are lifted right out of sit
- coms
,
and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of
" free lobotomy
" lab experiment
. woo is a spontaneous
, energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all thge wrong places
. her latest relationship
, with a testosterone
- overdosed drug
- dealer
, came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper
. now
, her transvestite
/ medium friend celestrial
( girlina
) predicts that she
' s about to meet mr
. right
,
and that he
' ll be a virgo
. later that day
, woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim
, a shy man with a penchant for neatness
and order
, who just happens to be a virgo
. it
' s not love at first sight
,
however
. things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass
,
and they get even worse when tghe pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a
" quiet
" dinner
. in the one
- hundred year history of motion pictures
, there have been a ton of bad
" white
" movies about mismatched lovers
, so i suppose it
' s only fair that we get a
" black
" effort of the same low caliber
. as in all romantic comedies
, we know from the beginning that woo
and tim are going to end up together
. the question is
, are their courtship rituals entertaining
? infront a good entry to the genre
, yhe audience becomes caught up in the love story
, noone matter how familiar it is
. in woo
, the constant reliance upon unfunny
, moronic humor sinks the project
. for thsoe who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes
, there
' s a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself
( added to that isnt the mystery of how the car looses its top
)
. sadly
, that
' s one of the film
' s most enjoyable sequences
,
and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional
. despite exuding charm from every pore
, there
' s little that pinkett smith
and davidson can do to save thier characters or david c
. johnson
' s script
. since it misses tjhe mark by so much
, a better nmae for woo might hve beeen whoops
.
