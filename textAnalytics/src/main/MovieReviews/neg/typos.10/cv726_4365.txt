cashing in on the success ofthe white men can ' t jump
and the failure of most of theri solo vehicles
( including tghe cowboy way
annd drop zone
)
, wesley snipes
annd woody harrelson have reteamed
, hoping that they can strike up the same success
. sadly
, if this dismal
, cliche ridden
and mind
- numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by
, they haven ' t got a chance in hell of even coming close
. htis time out
, the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops
. following several run
- ins with their tyrannical boss
( robert blake
)
, who is obsessed with the
" moeny train
"
-
- a train which carries all the subway ' s takings
-
-
and will let nothing stop it
( now
* there ' s
* an original plot device
)
, harrelson ' s character decides to try
and take off with the cash
. along the way
, both of them fall in love with the same woman
-
- another transit cop who also hates her boss
. this leads to the tipical sibling rivalry crap that ytou usually find in a film of this standard
( ' you were always the better brother ' etc
. etc
. etc
.
)
,
and doesn ' t help to add anything to the film
. given a better script
, better performers in supporting roles
and a shorter running tiem
( hte film almost went for two hours
-
- or did it jstu feel like it
?
)
, this film might
(
and i mean
* might
*
) have turned out okay
,
but as it is
, it is stocked with the worst action film cliches
, whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running tiem
. robert blake
, who plays the evil boss
, has got to be thte most pathetic bad guy in film history
! he soudns like wayne newton
,
and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as
though they are about to burst out of their sockets
!
but this is only one of money train ' s problems
. if you look at the script as if it was an action film
, it lacks originality
and suspense
.
but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film
, it is even worse
. the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised
and the characters definitely ain ' t butch
and sundance
. tje film isn ' t all bad
though
. snipes
and harrelson
, when they aren ' t using the dumb cliches that the scirpt gives them
, make an agreeable duo
,
and some of hte stunt
- work is indeed excellent
.
but good stunt
- work cannot save a bottom
- of
- the
- barrel action movie
. if you ' re a really undemanding action freak
, there ' s a chance you ' ll like this
.
but if you ' re looking for something original
, or suspenseful
, try somewhere else
-
- i doubt you ' ll find it here
.
