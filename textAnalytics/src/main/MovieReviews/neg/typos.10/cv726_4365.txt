cashing in on the success of white men can
' t jump
and the failure of most of their solo vehicles
( includng the cowboy way annd drop zone
)
, wesley snipes adn woody harrelson ahve reteamed
, hoping thgat they can strike up the same succes
. sadly
, if this dismal
, cliche ridden
and mind
- numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by
, htey haven
' t got a chance in hell of even coming close
. this time out
, the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops
. following several run
- ins with their tyrannical boss
( robert blake
)
, who is obsessed with the
" money train
"
-
- a train which carries all the subway
' s takings
-
-
and will let nothing stop it
( now
* there
' s
* an original plot divice
)
, harrelson
' s chracter decides to try
and tkae off with the cash
. allong the way
, both of them fall in love with the same woman
-
- another transit cop who also hates her boss
. this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find iin a film of this st
andart
(
' you were always the better brother
' etc
. etc
. etc
.
)
,
and doesn
' t help to add anything to the film
. given a better script
, better performers in supporting roles
and a shorter running time
( the film almost went for two horus
-
- or did it just feel like it
?
)
, this film might
(
and i mean
* might
*
) have turned out okay
, bu as it is
, it is stocked with the worst action film cliches
, whose only purpose appears tothe be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time
. robert blake
, who plays the evil boss
, has got tothe be the most pathetic bad guy in film history
! he sounds like wayne newton
, annd appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as
though htey are about to burst out ofthe their sockets
!
but thsi is only one of money train
' s problems
. if you look at the script as if it was an acation film
, it lacks originality
and suspense
.
but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film
, it is even worse
. the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised
and the characters definitely ain
' t
butch
and sundance
. the film isn
' t all bad
though
. snipes
and harrelson
, when they aren
' t using the dumb cliches that the script gives them
, make an agreeable duo
,
and some of the stunt
- wokr is indeed excellent
.
but good stunt
- work cannot save a bottom
- of
- the
- barrel acation movie
. if you
' re a really undem
anding action freak
, there
' s a chance you
' ll like this
.
but if you
' re looking for something original
, or suspenseful
, try somewhere else
-
- i doubt you
' ll find it here
.
