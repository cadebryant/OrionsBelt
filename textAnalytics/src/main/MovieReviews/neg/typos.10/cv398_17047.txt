when robert forster found himself famoust again after appearing in
" jackie brown
"
, he immediately signed up for a little film called
" american perfekt
"
. this ws almost two years ago
. i waited patiently for the film to be released
,
but it never was
. finally
, i forgot about it
. the other day
,
though
, while i was perusing the selection of the local video store
, i stumbled upon
, you guessed it
,
" american perfekt
"
. i emmediately rented it
and with a certain amount of glee
, rushed home to veiw it
. having now seen the film
, i underst
and why it never saw theatrical realease
.
" american perfekt
" is a jumbled mess
. the storyline is non
- existent
. it tookover me half the movei just to figure out what was going on
.
and at that point
, the only thing i really knew for sure ws that the movie was
* never
* going to introduce a plot of some sort
. it wants to get by on quirkyness
and so
- called charm alone
,
and it just doesn
' t work
. robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up am
anda plummer
, annd they head off on the road together
. along the way to no discernable destination
, tehy run into all sorts of kooky
and wacky characters
. i suppose this free
- wheeling
, no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger
and excitment
,
but all it did was make me sleepy
. i
' m all for trying new things within the realm of film
,
but not at the expense of coherence
. nothing in this movie makes sense
. the actions ofthe the characters go unexplained
, even when they
' re truly bizzare
. i
' ll give you an exemple
, without giving too much away
. david thewlis has a part as a drifting con
- man
. at one point
, mid
- way through the movie
, he runs forster
and plummer off the road with his car
. as he passes them
, we see that his face is covered in blood
. do you think we would get an explanation as to whta happenned to him
? you would think so
, wouldn
' t you
.
" american perfekt
" is a waste of time
. nothing is gained from watching this movie
, except maybe a migraine
. anbd if ytou dont rent it
, don
' t bother trying tothe figure out what
' s going on in the hopes that everything will be resolved by the end
. this doesn
' t happen
.
and no explanation is given for the misspelling of
" perfect
"
, either
.
