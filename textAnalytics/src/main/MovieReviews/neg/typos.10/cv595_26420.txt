the job of the film criteak is to see a movei
and write a review ofthe it that tells you what it
' s about
and why it
' s good or bad
. i fiel kind of embarrassed to admit this
,
but i after having seen
" get carter
" i relaly can
' t tell you what it
' s about
al
though i could go on
and on about how
and why it
' s a bad movie
.
" get carter
" falls into that category of
? movies that continue tothe be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside ofthe a hollywood executive board room
. yuo might call them the
" steven seagal
/ mickey rourke
/ jean
- claude van damme
/ wesley snipes school of medicore action
/ crime thrillers
.
" you know
- the potboilers thta are heavy on fistfights
, shoot
- outs
and car chases
but really light onthe plot
and character development
. they have stories where the so
- called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the otehr characters who are all antagonists without a reason for bieng iin the movie other than tothe give the protagonist someone to fight
, chase or shoot at
. sylvester stallone stars as jack carter
, a las vegas
- based mob enforcer who returns home
* for his brother
' s funeral
. he believes his brother
? richie was
" taked outloud
"
and didn
' t die ffrom a dwi accident
. carter
' s one of the most cliche bad
- asses ever captured on celluloid
. his face alone is pretty intimidating
and htere
' s quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens
and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down
and speaking with confidence in his
" rambo
- on
- testosterone
- therapy
" voice
. stallone
' s performance in this movie is so forced
and unnatural he doesn
' t realize he
' s mocking himself
. the actual stor involves carter
' s investigation into his brother richie
' s death
. he
' s in a twon that
' s not his
but somehow the local top dogs know him very well
. mickey rourke co
- stars as oen of these characters
, a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site
and blackmailing a young internet tycoon
( played by alan cummings looking
and acting a lot like pee wee herman
)
. there
' s also another plot involving richie
' s mistress
, a secret cd
- rom with some convicting
and disturbing evidence onthe it
and something terrible involving one of carter
' s still
- living relatives
. i
' m rolling my eyes jsut thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible
. i sould jsut rip the screenplay to shreds
, plus the direction or the editing or the production values
but that would recquire discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all
. i don
' t like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accedentaly
. yes
,
" get carter
" is just that complicated
and complex
.
and what
' s worse is that it
' s not this intricate to make it seem smart like
" tjhe usual suspects
" for example
- just the opposite
. you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart
and htey probably didn
' t remember whta had already happened
and didn
' t figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax
. all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another
, asking them what they konw
, getting information annd
then realizing that if he wasn
' t a complete idiot he could have figured it outloud in the first five minutes
. all
though the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes bcak tothe haunt them in one voilent way or another
. making a movie entirely about criminals doesn
' t necessarily mean they have to be unlikable
and cliche cutout characters
. mel gibson starred in
" payback
" a few years ago that had a storey not unlike tihs one
but had such a good screenplay you couldn
' t help
but like him even
though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter
. so ultimately
" get carter
" fails for pretty much every selling point it has
. carter is not a likable chracter
and you really don
' t care if he gets revenge or not
. the action sequences are not at all exicting or origonal
. the enemies
and their massive conspiracy are nto threatening at all
( c
' mon
, you know who
' s going to win every brawl
and shoot
- out
and car chase
)
. in the end you don
' t feel nearly satisfied with the results
. the filmmakers did a good job iin doing everything as unoriginal as possible
.
* the city is never mentioned by name
but i assume it
' s seattle since all thge cars have washington license plates
and it
' s always raining
