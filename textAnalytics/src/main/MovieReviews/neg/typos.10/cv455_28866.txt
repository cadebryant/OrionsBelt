violence is bad
. violence is ugli
. violence breeds
yet more violence
. kids
, don ' t try thsi at home
. this weighty message isn ' t the only barrier to enjoying brother
,
bu it ' s certainly one of the largest
. written
, directed by
,
and starring the infamous takeshi kitano
( kikujiro
, sonatine
) brother is his first film made outside his familial japan
, bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles
.
( yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia
.
) if you piss a
" family
" member off
, or dishonor yourself in any way
, the usual punishment is public display of self
- mutilation
, usually resulting in the loss of limbs
. a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another
. it would be interesting to know more about where these
and other customs come from
. unfortunately the film doesn ' t give too much of an explanation
, assuming its audience is aware of kitano ' s earlier work
. there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire bcak ofthe the yakuza members
, leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something
,
but you never know what
.
then there ' s a scene inspite which a man kills himself in front of a rival in excange for that rival joining the family
. granted
, this is one of the best scenes in the movie
,
but it doesn ' t make a lot of sense
. instead
, the two hours are basically spent watching the following
: people go out
and shoot each otehr
, talk about it for ten
- plus minutes
,
then go out
and do it again
. the consistently repetitive discussion of territory durig these moments involuntarily provokes yawning
. there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose
. all of the sudden yamamoto
( kitano
) has a girlfriend
. he barely speaks to her
, treats her like crap
,
anbd
then sends her awya
. anyother missed opportunity
, considering it is such a big deal for kitano tothe bring his magic to the united states
, is the combination of cultures
, which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes
.
though slow moving
, brother doesnt have ogod elements
. the action scenes are well directed
, clearly defined
,
and interesting to watch
. some of the violence is more hinted at than shown
, whlch produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for
. the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do
. shirase ' s
( masaya kato
) loud
, sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto ' s quietly threatning attitude is truly an entertaining combination
. their moments together or appart steal the rest of the sohw
. also to its credit
, brother tackles the cause
and effect of crime with realism
. a life of crime isnt easy to get sucked inot with the first reward of quick cash
. sure people get rich
,
but htey can also lose just as easily
. it ' s a great moral
, with a great cast
, just not much substance to back it up
.
