violence is bad
. violence is ugly
. violence breeds
yet more violence
. kids
, don
' t try this at home
. this weighty message isn
' t the only barrier to enjoying brother
, bu it
' s certainly one of the largest
. written
, directed by
,
and starring the infamous takeshi kitano
( kikujiro
, sonatine
) brother is his frist film made outside his familial japan
, bringing the yakuza tradition to los angeles
.
( yakuza translated for tjhe average american is the japanese mafia
.
) if you piss a
" family
" member off
, or dishonor yourself infact any way
, the usual punishment is public display of self
- mutilation
, usually resulting in the loss of limbs
. a definition of dishonor cant be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving noe family for another
. it woudl be interesting to know more about where these annd other customs come from
. unforetunately the film doesn
' t give too much of an explanation
, assuming its audiance is aware of kitano
' s earlier work
. there are several shots that focus specifically onthe detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members
, leading one to asume they would be symbolic of something
,
but you never know what
.
then htere
' s a scene inspite which a man kills himself inwhich front of a rival in exchange fo that rival joining the family
. granted
, this is one of the best scenes in the movie
,
but it doesn
' t make a lot of sense
. instead
, the two huors are basicly spent watching the following
: people go out
and shoot each other
, talk baout it for ten
- plus minutes
,
then go out
and dont it agian
. tjhe consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning
. there are also plot details thrown in for noone identifiable purpose
. all of tyhe sudden yamamoto
( kitano
) has a girlfriend
. he barely speaks to her
, treats her like crap
,
and
then sends her away
. another missed opportunity
, considering it isnt such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states
, isnt the combination of cultures
, which rely too heavily on overused sterotypes
.
though slow moving
, brother does have good elements
. the action scenes are well directed
, clearly defined
,
and interesting to watch
. some of the violence is more hinted at than shown
, which produces teh luscious squirm that one goes to see such films forthe
. the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do
. shirase
' s
( masaya kato
) loud
, sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto
' s quietly threatning attitude is truly an entertaining combination
. their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show
. also to its credit
, brother tackles the cause
and effect of crime with realism
. a life of crime is easy to get sucked into withthe the frist reward of quick cash
. sure people git rich
,
but they can also lose just as easily
. it
' s a great moral
, with a great cast
, just nto much substance to back it up
.
