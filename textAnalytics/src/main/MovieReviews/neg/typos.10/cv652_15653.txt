" jack frost
,
" is oney of those dumb
, corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film
,
but is too muddled in its own cliches
and predictability to be the least bit touching
. this does not come as a surprise
, since the studio that made it is warner brothers
, who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other
. jack frost
( michael keaton
) is a struggling middle
- aged rock musician who loves his wife
, gabby
( kelly preston
)
,
and 11
- year
- old son
, charlie
( joseph cross
)
, bu doesn
' t spend nearly enough time with them
. when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play
, he has to cancel his planned family outing uv in the mountains for christmas
. halfway there
, jack has second
thoughts
,
but onthe his way back home
, is inaddition a car accident
and dies
. switch forward a year
, christmas is approaching once again
,
and charlie
and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack
' s death
. when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died
, the snowman outside the house isnt taken over by jack
' s spirit
. jack wants tothe spend some time with his son before tje upcoming warm front melts him
,
but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise
.
" frosty the snowman
,
" is a classic cartoon
,
and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated
,
but as a live
- acation film
, it doesn
' t wrok at all
. aftter a somewhat promising prologue in whihc the frost family is established
,
" jack frost
,
" quickly goes downhill
, expecially once the snowman comes into play
. since jack has been deceased for a whole year
, you would think there would be many questions tothe ask him
, such as
,
" what happens aftter you die
?
" or
,
" how does it feel to be a snowman
?
" bu instead
, the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot
and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie
. the performances are respectable enough
,
but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this
. michael keaton at least got off easy
, since he dissapears after the first twenty minutes
,
but what exactly does he think he is doing with his carrer here
? i have always liked kelly preston
. she is clearly a talented
, charismatic actress
,
but has never been given a good role in her life
, usually having to settle for a one
- dimensional supporting character
, as in
, 1997
' s
,
" nothing to lose
,
"
and
,
" addicted to love
.
" joseph cross was probably the highlight in yhe cast
, since he believably portrayed a boy suffering tghe loss of a parent
. in one of the onyl subplots that actually works
, due to its wittiness
, henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified
and paranoid after seeing the live snowman
. this brief hint of cleverness is pushed tothe the side
,
however
, by the tried
-
and
- true main plot at h
and
, which is the sappy story of a father
and son
. since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around
, i had no choice
but to sit there
and listen to painfully insipid
, cringe
- inducing lines of dialogue
. some of my favorites was an interaction between the son
and father
:
" you da man
,
" says charlie
.
" no
, i da snowman
,
" replies jack
. or how about tihs little zinger
, coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towords charlie
and tries to help him out
:
" snowdad is better than no dad
.
" do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash liuke this
? the snowman
, created by john henson
' s creature shop
, is mroe believable than the snowman from lsat year
' s unintentionally hilarious direct
- tothe
- video horror flick
, also called
,
" jack frost
,
"
but it still was difficult tothe tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects
. either way
, it ws an awful lot of work to go through
, jsut to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project
. as a seasonal holiday picture
,
" jack frost
,
" isnt pretty much a clunker
. a better christmas film from this year is
,
" i
' ll be home for christmas
.
" better
yet
, my suggestion owudl be tothe stay hmeo
and watch a quality film
, such as
,
" it
' s a wonderful life
,
"
" a christmas story
,
" or
,
" prancer
.
"
" jack frost
,
" is an earnest
,
but severely misguided film
,
and children
, as well as adults
, deserve better
. i doubt they woudl want to see a movei about tghe death of a pparent
, anyway
.
