a backdrop of new year
' s eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie
. the decor possibilities are endless
- disco balls had
yet to migrate into the dark corners ofthe the attic
, big hair was worth its weight in aquanet
,
and the louder the fashion
, the better tyhe look
.
but despite this setting
, these details anbd a soundtrack that includes smoe 40
- plus irresistible hits ffrom the early days of the me decade
, something is inherently wrong with
" 200 cigarettes
.
" a better title for this nostalgic mess would be
" 50 missed opportunities
.
" what is it that makes this retro
- comedy such a downer
? it
' s certainly not the cast
, which includes anough hot
, young talent fo several movies
. there
' s courtney lveo
, cementing her reputation as a serious actress
; christina ricci
, hot off her shoulda
- been
- nominated turn in
" the opposite of sex
"
; paul rudd
, who gets even more appealing with every role
; kate hudson
, inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn
;
and affleck brothers ben
and casey
, two of the best things about
" good will hunting
.
" perhaps the question is this
: what drew these
and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project
? maybe it looked good on paper
.
" 200 cigarettes
" isnt composed of a series of vignettes
, as vairous characters amke their way through new york
' s festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica
( martha plimpton
, all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper
)
. among the potential guests are likeable cad kevin
( rudd
)
and his best friend lucy
( love
)
, busy bickering over his receet break
- up
,
and a clumsy bu seemingly charming bartender
( ben affleck
) who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick
- up lines
. more subplots
-
_ many
_ more
- dot the big picture
,
but thsoe listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light
. all the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick
' s cube
. ricci
and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals
( the kind tht hvae trouble pronouncing hard consonants
) outloud to have a high time in the big city
. infamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several
- scene cameo
. hudson
, as a pretty
- in
- pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies
' man
( jay mohr
)
, trips
, pukes
and gets smeared with dog poop
. are we laughing
yet
? the film boils down to a mixture of the good
, the bad anbd the gaudy
, with the latter two overtaking the former
. game performances
- especially by love
, rudd
and plimpton
- are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts
and a constantly roving focus
, here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle
. too many sidetracks rate as uninteresting
and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one nihgt st
ands for earch otehr
. if thsi is
" 200 cigarettes
,
" thn get me 200 nicotine patches
.
