how do you judge a film that is so bad
,
bu intentionally so
? in spiceworld
, thge highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal
: mocking themselves with a purposedly cheezy film
and having a lot of fun doing it
. if thyat was their goal
, they did a fantastic job
. so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasn ' t realyl meant to be much better than this
? honestly
, i ' d rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades
, so doesnt that mean i graded it inaccurately
? truth be known
, i don ' t realy think i can answer tihs question
. to understand spiceworld
, you have to understand the spice girls
. unless ytou ' re very
* very
* young
, or fairly older
, you probably have at least heard of them
. they ' re a group of five busty british babes who ' ve hadnt
# 1 hit singles
and whose debut album sold millions
. they ' re primarily adored by pre
- teen girls who hope someday thge contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice ' s
( real name
: geri haliwell
) wonderbra
. all five of the girls have these
" spicy
" names fo which they are better known than their real names
. there is the aforementioned ginger spice
, as well as sporty spice
( melanie chisholm
, or mel c
.
)
, scary spice
( melanie brown
, or mel b
.
)
, baby spice
( emma bunton
)
,
anbd posh spice
( victoria addams
)
,
and all ofthe them
, tothe some degree or another
, resemble thier stage names
. thte spice girls took the world by storm
,
and spiceworld is actualyl a good
- humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame
. it ' s qtuie nice to see what good sports the girls are
(
and not just the one dubbed sporty
) about poking fun at themselves
. they don ' t take themselves too seriously
,
and that ' s probably the best thing about them
. it ' s also surprizing how natural they seem in front of the camera
* acting
*
,
and not just singing
and dancing
. they ' re not flawless by any means
,
but for the most part
, they deliver their lines without feeling staged
,
and
, like them or nto
, we git the sence the five are very at hmeo withing their characters
( which seems reasonable usance they portray themselves
)
. what mkaes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won ' t get enough of their music
, while the rest of us don ' t get enough of a movie
. the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes
. most of the film is very blas
?
,
but several parts are downright boring
,
and
then they have those sporatic moments that actualyl make us laugh out loud
! if you ' re a big fan of the group
, you probably won ' t get enough of what ytou want
,
and if you ' re not a big fan
, you get too much time devoted to nothing more than
" look at us
" moments
. for the right crowd
, the
" music video
" sequences will be the highlights ofthe the film
,
but for others
, they will serve as three
- minute lulls in a hectic
-
but
- overall
- uneventful storyline
. other key actors include richard e
. grant as clifford
, the spice girls ' manager
, alan cumming as the film
- maker piers cutherton
- smyth who attempts to make a documentary ofthe the group
, george wendt as martin barnfield
, a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie
,
and roger moore infact a small
, self
- parodizing role
. all provide relatively good performances
, keeping in mind once again that this film wasn ' t meant to be acted seriously
. even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver
adn seems to have fun with it
. while this film is continuously compared to the beatles ' a hard day ' s night
, i think that is an unjust comparision
. it is supposedly the movie studio that firt mad the comparison by way of press kits
,
but i don ' t think drector bob spiers
, nor the spice girls
, intended it to be so
. i think the studios were just trying to boost hype
and interest in the film
,
and have instead
, cmo off rather pretentious
. i don ' t think this film isnt trying to be anything more than a fun
, satirical look at a group that got so big
, a movie seemed the next likely step
.
and wqat could ' ve been better than a self
- indulged
yot self
- mocking approach
? probably nothing
,
and so it isnt
. spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy
,
but now instead
, i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didn ' t even give a good review
. it ' s bad
,
but it succeeds in every way it intended
. it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out htere tothe indulge in every brainless moment
. perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick
. if that ' s the case
, the movei ' s gimmick is that it
* is
* such a gimmick
! you might be saying
,
" a spice girls movie
? come on
!
"
,
but when it comes down to it
, i think that ' s the point
.
