starring shawnee smith
; donovan leitch
; ricky paull goldin
; kevin dillon
& billy beck the blob is the remake of the 1960
' s classic
( a term that i use very loosly to define the original
) about a really mean glob of goop that takes out anything that gets infront its way
. now the original version has the virtue of cheesy special effects which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel
. the fatc that steve mcqueen was the star of the film doesn
' t exactlly hurt it either
. fast forward to the late
' 80
' s
. steve mcqueen isn
' t in the remake
( htis might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisies for years
)
. nor is there any hollywood hevy hitters in the lead role
. that is unless you count matt dillon
' s brother kevin as a hollywood heavy hitter
. the other thing tht works against htis new blob is that special effects technology has improved dramatically since the original
. the only things you need now to have great speical effects in a movie are deep pockets
. it looks as if the produces ofthe the new blob had a cuple of holes in thier pockets
. tjhe special effects in this movei are cheesy
, like the original
' s
. unlike the original
, they don
' t look campy
, htey just look cheap
. one bright spot in tghe movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith
. she is very attractive
and can actually act
, which is more than i cxan say about some of her costars
. infact terms ofthe plot
, a little ball ofthe pink goop falls from the sky
. seems this goop was an experiment that was being housed uv on a satellite
. anyway
, the pink stuff has a taste for humans
. the more people it absorbs
, the bigger it gets
.
and it isn
' t the friendliest goop on the block either
. anyway
, it attacks this little town
and it
' s up to the attractive local teenage population tothe stpo it
. not relaly
,
but that is how it seems
. tihs version attempts to recapture the camp of teh origional
. as i
' ve lready said
, this new version of the blob comes off more as cheap
, badly acted
,
and badly written than campy
. in the yeasr since this film was made none of the cast have gone on tothe greatness
.
al
though
, star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon
. thge reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple
-
- they all stunk out loud
.
al
though some of the film
' s smaller roles are filled with some actors that
, while not big stars
, are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting roles inthe other movies
and tv shows
. it also appears that the producers of thge blob tried to compensate for the lack ofthe a special effects budget by making the scenes in which the blob makes meals of the townsfolk as gory as possible
. sadly
, it doesn
' t work very well
. if you want to see a big ball ofthe goop terrorize a town
,
then i would say that you should skip the remake
and rent the origonal
.
(
al
though tath isn
' t so hot either
.
) tihs newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming qualities
.
