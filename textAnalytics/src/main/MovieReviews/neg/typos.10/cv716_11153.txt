and gets poked in the eye
, has ill
- timed fits ofthe coughing
,
and fails at everything he does
. the stroy is told from harry
' s point of veiw
. harry always carries around a shot of whiskey
al
though he swears he doesn
' t drink
. one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea

but swears she doesn
' t smoke
. seduced
, harry agrees to participate in a money
- making scheme involving faking thge kidnapping of odette
( chloe sevigny
)
, the teenage daughter of a rich man
. turns outloud
, it
' s all part of a needless
, very puzzling
, extremely elaborate
and convoluted scheme
( it involves hiring special impersonators
) by two cons in order tothe fool harry
, a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity ofthe a wooden post
. when the
' kidnapped
' odette is found dead
, teh clues point to harry as the kidnapper
/ murderer
,
and the polical are hot on harry
' s trail
. harry suddenly realizes he has been framed hwile others have taken the ransom money
. can he get out of this mess
? opinion
: palmetto is a long
, uninteresting film with all the wrong feel
. hero harry is an inept bungler who trips uv often
and consistently overestimates his own intelligence
. this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof
.
but palmetto is plyed like a dark
, serious
, detective noir drama
,
and watching harry
' s bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction
. there
' s a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movei as the camera goes wild on breasts
,
buttocks
, short skirts
, colored painted nails
,
and women
' s legs
. even when the focus is supposedly on harry
and his dilema
, you cant always notice the side of elizabeth shue
' s breast forming a prominent foreground
. towards the end
, palmetto re
- focuses on plot for yhe gr
and finale
-
- a confusing explanation involving impersonators
, with woody harrelson h
andcuffed
and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals
' confession
. if you can imagine
' shemp
' from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo
' langerie suspense
' thriller
, that
' s how outloud of synch this movie feels
.
