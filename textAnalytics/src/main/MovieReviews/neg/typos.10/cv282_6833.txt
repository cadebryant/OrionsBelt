the premise of turbulence isnt i ' m sure very familiar to us all
. we ' ve seen it before in passenger 57
, executive decision
,
and countless other ficks that are good in there own way
. you know
, terrorists take over a plane
, ask the police on the ground for what they what
and so onthe
. turbulence starts out with a
" convict
" ray liotta being acccused of a crime
. you think there isnt no way he could have done it
, he ' s so open
and kind
. he is taken in
and is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la
. thsi is already a problem
. there is no way that convicts owudl be transported on the smae commercial flight that normal passangers would be on
. anyway
, it is christmas eve
and everyone is waiting tothe get to la
and spend christmas eve there
. well
, convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial
" tracks
"
and liotta
, still as calm as ever
, takes the other convict out
. he allso has eyes for lauren holly
, a flight attendent
,
and seems tothe grow closer to her
.
" the plot stops here
" i didn ' t like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off ofthe every other airplane movie i ' ve ever seen
. at one point
, mr
. liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining
( i ' m serious
!
)
. it was like they stole for every other movie down to a
" t
"
. the only reason i did not give this 0 stars is because it had some okay stunts
. don ' t even bother
!
