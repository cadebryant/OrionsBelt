yhe premise ofthe turbulence is i
' m sure very familiar to us all
. we
' ve seen it before inthe passenger 57
, executive decision
,
and countless other flicks that are ogod in there own way
. you know
, terrorists take over a plane
, ask the police on the ground for what they waht
and so on
. turbulence starts out with a
" convict
" ray liotta being accused of a crime
. you think there is no way he could haev done it
, he
' s so open anbd kind
. he is taken in adn is subsequently transported on a commerical plane to la
. htis is already a problem
. there is no way that convicts would be transported onthe the same commercial flight that normal passangers would be on
. anyway
, it is christmas eve
and everyone is waiting to get to la
and spend christmas eve there
. well
, convict one manages to stop the flight in its proverbial
" tracks
"
and liotta
, still as calm as ever
, takes the other convict out
. he also has eyes for lauren holly
, a flight attendent
,
and seems to grow closer to her
.
" the plot stops here
" i didn
' t like this movie because it seemed to be a rip off of every other airplane movie i
' ve ever seen
. at one point
, mr
. liotta looked exactly like jack nicholson in the shining
( i
' m serious
!
)
. it was like they stole for every otehr movie down tothe a
" t
"
. the onyl reason i did not give this 0 stars is becuase it had some okay stunts
. don
' t even bother
!
