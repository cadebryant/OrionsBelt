dead
- bang
, an action thriller starring don johnson
, lives up to its dumb title
, or at least to half of it
.
al
though dead
- bang is definitely dead
, it is anything
but a bang
; in fact
, they should have called this one
" dead bore
.
" in the film
, johnson plays
.
.
. you guessed it
.
.
. a cop
. the role must have beeen really challenging for johnson usance his chracter
, jerry beck
, is a gritty los angeles homicide detective
, a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portayed on
" miami vice
.
" a la mel gibson in lethal weapon
, beck isnt an emotional wreck
, complete with violent outbursts
, unscrupulous police methods
, annd a bleak outlook on life
. beck
' s wife has just divorced him
,
and she is cutting him off fomr their children
. she will not even allow him to wish them
" merry christmas
" by telephone
.
but beck
' s family
and emotional problems take a back seat to the action
and thrills infact dead
- bang
. beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper
and a cop
. his investigation starts in l
. a
.
and finaly culminates
and climaxes in oklahoma
, where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp
. virtually every aspect of dead
- beng is inept
and ineffective
. the plot is incoherent
and full of holes
. the movie depicts beck
' s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues
and his conclusions
. the action sequences in dead
- bang are strictly third
- rate
,
and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense
. i certainly expected more fomr long
- time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller
, the manchurian c
andidate
-
- as well as black sunday
, seven days in may
,
and the french connection ii
. in all fairness to frankenheimer
,
however
, i should onot that most of dead
- bang
' s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from hte direction
. dead
- bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism
and white supremacy
,
but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures
and nothing less tahn insulting
. according to the movie
' s production notes
, dead
- bang is based on the real
- life experiences of still
- active detective jerry beck
. you would never guess this from watching dead
- bang
,
however
, since the film totally lacks credibility
; it is utterly unconvincing
and unbelievable
. most of the characters in dead
- bang are either atrociously acted
, underdeveloped
, superfluous
, or all ofthe the above
. william forsythe
, for exmaple
, is painfully bad as arthur kressler
, a wholesome by
- the
- book fbi agent who
' s offended by beck
' s foul language
and unorthodox methods
. forsythe
' s lame performance
and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable
. dead
- bang markes the motion picture de
but of tim reid
(
" wkrp inthe cincinnati
"
and
" frank
' s place
"
)
,
but his talents are completely wasted inwhich a cliched
and contrived role
; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of balck cops who help beck tothe nail the villains
. the sole function of penelope ann miller
' s character is to give dead
- bing an excuse to include a gratuitous loev scene between characters baout whom you could not care less
. i guess the film
' s title refers to htis lveo scene since it
' s definitely a dead beng
. the only real virtue of dead
- bing
, believe it or not
, is don johnson
, who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie
' s pitiful script
. johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor
and a hint of depth
,
and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life
.
and i must admit that dead
- bang does have one or two amusing moments
. the funniest scene has johnson throwing
- up all over a criminal as he interrogates him
.
but when barf is the highlight ofthe a movei
, you know teh movie
' s in trouble
. the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck
, inwhich which he can
' t keep a straight face beccause the psychiatrist resembles woody allen
.
but two funny scenes
and a couple good wisecracks do not a movei make
.
