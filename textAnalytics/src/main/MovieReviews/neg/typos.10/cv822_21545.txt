bats is this year ' s camp flick
. with the world ' s worst dialogue
, cheesiest premise
and stupidest editor
, this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity
. as for the rest of us
, well
.
.
. i ' d say skip it
,
bu looking at thte box office figures for this one
, it seems as
though most of america is following that advice anyway
. follow their lead
and you ' ll sparce yourself 90 minutes of your life
and 8 bucks to boot
. i love alfred hitchcock ' s the birds
, almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based
. it saddens me even more
,
then
, to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror
/ schlock such as bats
. when mysterious bat attacks occour inwhich a small texas town
, the authorities call in a batologist
( dina meyer
) to investigate
. it turns out that a creepy scientist
( bob gunton
) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab
, mkaing them smarter
and more vicious
. why has he done this
, you ask
? because
, you see
, it is apparently a scientist ' s job tothe make things
" a little better
,
" even if that means the death of all mankind
. so the batologist
, her wisecracking sidekick
and the town sheriff
( lou diamond phillips
) have to kill all the bats
and save the world
. of course
, thta can ' t happen before they wallow in some guamo
( bat shit
, forthe thge uninitiated
)
, get up close
and personal witht some truly repulsive flying mammals
and survive soem of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture
. consider
, for example
, a scene where two peple are in a bat cave
. the bats are all sleeping
,
but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out
. what dont tehy do
? do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can
? nope
. they stand there for a while
, transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes
. what keesh bats from being scary or creepy isnt the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes
. we don ' t even get to see what ' s going onthe
; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick
. all we know is that bats are attacking
. how they are attacking
and what exactly is happening remains a mystery
. a little technical preficiency does wonders for horror movies
,
and bats sure could use some
. ofthe course
, director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor
,
but it is so conventional it doesn ' t raelly go anywhere
. most ofthe the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist ' s wisecracking sidekick
( leon
)
, who takes every oportunity to sputter ingenius lines like
" i hate bats
!
" some of theese are so bad that they take on a double quality
: they may inspire a smirk by their very nature
and a roaring laugh becasue tehy are so inept
. i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one
- liners
. palying such characters does not help actors ' careers
. still
, i suppose thgat if you ' re looking for a movie that is
" so bad it ' s good
,
" you could do worse than bats
. it does have a tremendous amount of camp value
. i ' m not
" reccommending
" the movie because
, quite frankly
, it sucks
,
and i know that this might convince soem peopel to go out
and see it
. more power to them
.
