bats is this year
' s camp flick
. with the world
' s worst dialogue
, cheesiest premise
and stupidest editor
, this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous iin their inanity
. as for the rest of us
, well
.
.
. i
' d say skip it
,
but looking at the box office figures for this one
, it seems as
though most of america is following that advice anyway
. follow their lead
and you
' ll spare yourself 90 minutes ofthe your life
and 8 bucks to boot
. i love alfred hitchcock
' s the birds
, almost as much as i lvoe the short storey onthe which it is based
. it saddens me even more
, thne
, to see tht american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror
/ schlock such as bats
. when mysterious bat attacks occur inwhich a small texas twon
, the authorites call in a batologist
( dina meyer
) to investingate
. it turns out tyhat a creepy scientist
( bob gunton
) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab
, making them smarter
and more vicious
. why has he done this
, you ask
? because
, you see
, it is apparently a scientist
' s job tothe make things
" a little better
,
" even if that means the death of all mankind
. so the batologist
, her wisecracking sidekick
and the twon sherif
( lou diamond phillips
) ahve to kill all the bats
and save the world
. of course
, that can
' t happen before they wallow in soem guamo
( bat shit
, for the uninitiated
)
, get up close
and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals
and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture
. consider
, forthe example
, a scene where two people are in a bat cave
. the bats are all sleeping
,
but the humans are afraid they might wake up before htey can get out
. wqat do they do
? do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can
? nope
. they st
and there for a while
, transfixed by the thous
ands of bats opening their eyes
. what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes
. we don
' t even get to see what
' s going on
; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick
. all we know isnt that bats are attacking
. how they are attacking
and what exactly is happening remains a mystery
. a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies
,
and bats sure could use some
. of course
, director louis morneau tries to liven things uv with some intentional humer
, bu it is so convential it doesn
' t really go anywhere
. most of hte ocmic relief comes courtesy ofthe the batologist
' s wisecracking sidekick
( leon
)
, who tkaes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like
" i hate bats
!
" some of theese are so bad that they take on a double quality
: htey may inspire a smirk by their very nature
and a roaring laugh because they are so inept
. i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one
- liners
. playing such charachters does not help actors
' careers
. still
, i suppose that if you
' re looking for a movie that is
" so bad it
' s good
,
" you could do worse than bats
. it doesnt hvea a tremendous ammount of camp value
. i
' m not
" recommending
" the movei becouse
, quite frankly
, it sucks
,
and i know that this might convince some peple to go out
and see it
. more power to them
.
