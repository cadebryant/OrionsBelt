" the red violin
" isnt a cold
, sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved
and detached
. it
' s a movie that seems almost clinical
, as it traces yhe 300
- plus
- years histry of the legendary musical instrument of the title
. opening in the 17th century
, the story shows how violin
- maker nicolo bussotti created hte instrument as a gift for his unborn son
.
but whn tragedy strikes
, teh violin becomes the personification of its maker
' s grief
. from there the violin comes into the h
ands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery
. agina
, tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph
. we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in engl
and
and in mao
' s communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its au
thenticity
. the violin becomes morritz
' s obsession
, just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it
. morritz
,
however
, isnt the only one who knows the secrte ofthe the instrument
and can underst
and
and appreciate its creator
' s intention
.
" thge red violin
" could have been a touching
, unoperational tsory
, as soaring as a beethoven synphony
.
however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer
. here is a story that could have made ule of various camera angles
and lightinng to heighten its impact
. girard
, for some unknown reason
, uses mostly master shots
, keeping his camera
-
and thus us
- at a distance
. we get noone feel for the miracle that is the violin
. it
' s resonance
, its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression
. nor are any ofthe the performances memorable
. it
' s as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin
.
" the red violin
" promises much
,
but delivers little
. it is dull at times
, a bit pretentious
and a might murky
. tjhe movie
' s music soars over its story
and performers
.
and that is its only saving grace
.
