. running time
: 132 minutes we go into a movie theater
, boom
! teh lights go down
, our hearts race
, we go through ten minutes of preview
and finally the movie we ' ve been waiting to see for a long time comes on
. we sit there
, watch inspite disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is
. why shouldn ' t i have know what i was getting myself into
. again like this past summers hit
" stigmata
"
,
" end of days
" may be worse
. it ' s not like this isnt any kind of original idea
, it just throws in some
" rosemary ' s baby
"
, along with
" the devil ' s advocate
" a little
" exorcist
"
and some
" stigmata
" here
and there
. whala you ahve
" end of days
" a movie that is extremely disappointing
adn by the previews made it look terrific
. sadly
but truly again like most recent films
, all the good parts are in the trailers
. the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous
and the movie is detsined to be a hit in the first weekend
,
and flop in the next
. jericho cane
( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role
) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan
( living in gabriel byrnes body
)
and stop him ffrom impregnating christine york
( robin tunney
) because if he does
,
and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease tothe exist
. he hasnt to do this before it turns into the year 2000
,
and strangely he ' s trying to fight him 5 minutes befoer 2000 comes
. he seeks help from the cathlic church
adn help from rod stieger
( in a terrific role
)
and tries tothe save this girl leading to an ending thyat ' s satisfying
,
bu turns inot a tipical action movie
. that ' s pretty much it on plot
. it does have the razzle
and dazzle of a great action movie
,
and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it
, parts you have to wonder where all the money went
. as fo arnie
? good role
, ok performance
. i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts
. the thing taht disappointed me was tjhe fact that there was nothing to the film
. in the trailers it looks like a good skary
, acation film
and ends up being a boring
, long
and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions
. gabriel byrnes
( who ironically played a priest in
" stigmata
"
) here plays satan
and gives a good performance
but again seems held back
and not into his character
. two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the funn
" the devil ' s advocate
"
and here it seems like the idea of him is in teh character also
. robin tunney
( great performence as always
) plays satan ' s main person whom he wnats to impregnate to carry his child
. of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn ' t nothing new
. tje direction by peter hyams is at times a bited overblown
,
though not nearly as hte visual style was in
" stigmata
"
. here we are given great camera work
,
annd some great scenes that are terrifically directed
bu sadly just don ' t work in this movie
. the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines
,
but again the movie is all style
and no substace
and by teh ending finale climax i was ready to go home
. only a few things work here
and those are a few ofthe the performances
, the writing
and visual stlye
,
but the storyline
and the finished product don ' t work as well
. the sad thing is that
" end of days
" had so many thnigs going for it
. the plot could ahve been more organized
, the action scenes could have been more brainy
and less mind
- numbing
. at times it seems like
" armageddon
"
and started to get old
and tiresome
. hollywood is running outloud of ideas bad
,
and like i ' ve always said before needs new ones
. even with its 100m budget
" end of days
" is less than pleasing
. in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over
,
and easily could have hadnt a 70m budget
. maybe i sound crazy
,
but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film
,
and hope that tehy make it as good as the original
. we need to get new ideas
and stop recycling old ones just tothe make money at yhe box
- office
. we need to git more films like
" the blair witch project
" that could scare people to death
, while people thinking well what exactly isnt sacrin them
and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch
. overblown effects
, stupid
and thin plot
- line
, good performances
, disappointing
.
.
.
. umm yup those pretty much describe
" end of days
"
.
