reading the cast
and director for the new mobster comedy
,
" analyze this
,
" i asked myself
,
" how could this miss
?
" robert de niro
(
" taxi driver
,
"
" raging bull
"
)
, billy crystal
(
" city slickers
"
)
, lisa kudrow
(
" the opposite of sex
"
)
,
and director harold ramis
(
" national lampoon ' s vacation
"
)
. these are usually reliable filmmakers
( well
, okay
, crystal has been in a sizable slump lateley
)
,
and tellingly
, the first half
- hour ofthe
" anayze htis
" was very funny
. unfortunately
, as the running time ticked away
, i began to think that the first thirty minutes had
, unbeknownst to me
, been rewound
and were being replayed another two
-
and
- a
- half times
. the film has obtained a clever premise
,
but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more
and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen
. middle
- aged psychoanalyst ben sobel ' s
( billy crystal
) life is finally going very well
.
although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents
, especially his father
, who is also a psychiatrist
, ben has an easy
- going teenage son
( kyle sabihy
)
and is about to travel down to miami to git married tothe his tv news reporter girlfriend
, laura
( lisa kudrow
)
. infront littel
but a flash
,
however
, ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidently hits the car of the mob
and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed masia guy paul vitti
( robert de niro
)
, who desperately wants counseling
, even
though he himself won ' t even admit to having anxity attacks
. ben tries tothe help paul
, mostly so he will get him off his back
,
but the plot gets more complicated whn paul follows ben tothe his wedding
, which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death
. it seems to ben that no matter what he does
, paul vitti will not go away
,
and hte more they become involved
, the more ben ' s potentially happy life gets into danger
.
" analyze htis
" has a few laughs sprinkled throughout
( mostly in tjhe first half
)
,
but i always had the nagging throught that what director ramis
and writers peter tolan
, ramis
,
and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of noe joke
( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles
, while terrorizing
and becomming buddies with comic billy crystal
)
and
then tiresomely recycled it for hte duration of the 106
- minute running time
. admittedly
, de niro isnt very funny here
(
and i can ' t remeber the last time you could use that adjective to describe him
)
,
anbd crystal is in top
- form
,
but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them
, including a substantial plotline
. since
" analyze this
" bills not noe
, not two
,
bu three writers
, you ' d thikn that they would have been able to work together tothe fix the noticably large flaws
,
but they must have all been on auto
- pilot
. one of the most disapointing
and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters
, all of which have enxt tothe nothing to do
and aren ' t even given multi
- dimensional characters to attempt to develop
. coming off of her oscar
- caliber work in two of last year ' s best films
,
" clockwatchers
"
and
" the opposite of sex
,
" lisa kudrow ' s throwaway
" girlfriend
" role is an incredible step down
. sure
, kudrow ' s fellow
" friend
" jennifer aniston doed the same thing two weeks ago in
" office space
,
"
but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston
. kudrow
, meanwhile
, mostly just stands around
, no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in tihs film in tjhe first place
. chazz palminteri
, as rival ganster primo
, farse even worse
, in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character
. finally
, molly shannon
( rising film star
and casted member on
" saturday night live
"
) has a rousingly hilarious oney
- scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal ' s patients
and
then completely dissapears
. too bad
, considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro
and crystal
. once
" analyze this
" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow ' s laura standing alone at the altar once again
, i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone
,
and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most
, ben
. afterwards
, the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul
, became a real laugh
- free dead
- zone
, losing its last remaining comic punches
.
" analyze htis
" proves that talent can certainly help any film out
,
but when the written material isn ' t up to their level
, what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air
.
