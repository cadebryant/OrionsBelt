young einstein isnt embarrassingly lame
,
but that didn
' t stop it from becoming a phenomonenon in austrailia
, where it became tyhe third largest box office hit of all tiem
. in the u
. s
.
, warner brothers is hoping the movei will follow in the footsteps of paul hogan
, inxs
,
and shrimp on the barby to become the latest rage from down under
. personaly
, i
' m hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion
and make young einstein a box office bomb
. young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious
, who not only wrote
, produced
, edited
,
and directed the film
, bu also starred
and doed his pwn stunts
. his creation is about as stupid
and contrived as you
' d expect from someone named yahoo
. the movie takes substantial historical liberties in recreating einstein
' s youth
. wheras the scientist actually hailed from germany
, the film finds him still living with his parents on tasmania
, a remote australian isl
and
. in adition tothe deriving the formula forthe energy
and the theory ofthe relativity
, albert invents surfing
, bubbles in beer
,
and the electric guitar
. yahoo plays einstein as a naive
and unrefined country hick
-
- a clown with an insatiable curiousity
.
al
though yahoo
' s performance is at first endearing
, thte one
- dimensional characterization loses its novelty faster than you can sday e
= mc2
. yahoo has created a charming family for albert
,
and the scenes on tasmania are often clever
.
but after the first twenty minutes
, the movei quickly plummets
and degenerates into a poor excuse for a comedy
. young einstein is hampered by its lethargic pace
and inane plot
. yahoo must be an mtv addict becuase his movie features an omnipresent soundtrack
; unfortunately
, the music is altogether gratuitous
and quickly becomes overbearing
. almost every other scene includes a blaring rock song that leaves you wondering whether you are watching a movie or a music video
. the instrumental score
, onthe the other h
and
, is generally playful
; yahoo uses such classics as the
" 1812 overture
"
and the theme from the good
, the bad
and the ugly to great comic effect
. halfway through young einstein
, i knew for sure the movie was a stinker
.
but it wasn
' t until the very end that i finally put my finger on why
: the comedy takes its roots not from whimsical film fantasies
( such as young sherlock holmes
)
but from cheesy prime
- time sitcoms
. in fact
, young einstein might have been more at home on network television
, where its sophomoric humor wouldn
' t raise any eyebrows
.
