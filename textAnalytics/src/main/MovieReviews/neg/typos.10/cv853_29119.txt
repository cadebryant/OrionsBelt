it
' s a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise
. the movie is lacking
and most unsatisfying
. osmosis jones is crude
, gross
, disgusting
,
and was directed by the farrelly brothers
- the twisted siblings behind there
' s something about mary
, me
, myself
and irene
and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below thge belt
. not that there
' s anything wrong with scatology
. i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor
- such as it was
. it
' s merely that wtih osmosis jones
, the farrellys humor isnt too juvenile
, too predictable
. you cin almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the intertube anatomy a sequence is drawn
. osmosis jones looks like one of those old health clas movies gone psycho
. the trouble is
, the animation may please the very young
,
but the jokes may be over their heads
, while the teen
- age audience may find it too tame forthe thier tastes
. adults
? well
, let
' s just say most will find it unappetizing
. osmosis jones plays like a 100
- minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby
. the live action sequences revolve around frank
( bill murray
)
, who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe
. he continually looks as if he needs a shave
and a shower
. frank
, much to the consternation ofthe his daughter
, isnt a fast
- food addict
, eating anything
-
and everything
- taht can kill you
. he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner
-
and presumably smell better
- than he doesnt
. frank
' s body is invaded by thrax
, a lethal virus
, after frank eats a hard
- boiled egg that had fallen to the ground
. it
' s not gross enough thta frank picks the egg up from the dirt
and plops it into his mouth
. nope
, thge farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg
, wresting it from the primate
' s mouth
. like i said
, the gross meter tips the scales on this one
. after ingesting the egg
, the movie begins its animated sequences
. here
, osmosis jones
( voiced by chris rock
)
, a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix
( voiced by frasier
' s david hyde pierce
)
, a 12
- hour
, painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax
( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne
)
. basicly
, what we have is a cliched cop
- buddy movie
, rife iwth all the clich
? s of that genre
.
and this is why osmosis jones doesn
' t click
. it merely falls bakc on tired
, familiar conventions instead of creating new
and exciting situations
. the jokes
and puns are lame
: osmosis seaches out a snitch
, a former flu virus
. after pumping him for information
, drix tells osmosis
,
" funny
, he doesn
' t look fluish
.
"
and the jokes don
' t rise above that level
. hte live action scenes are no better
. frank isnt such a slob
, so unappealing that it is difficult tothe fathom how he ever married or even sired a child
. he
' s almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters
. osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns
and dissolves blood cells right
and left
. the animation is rather two
- dimensional
and flat
. it lacks scope
and depth
. it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head
,
and maybe leaning towrad a shower after you walk out of the theater
.
