by
- the
- numbers
: a film which introduces charactors
, situations
, dilemmas
and developments that we ' ve seen before in a parade of other films
. a film hwihc can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one
. a film which is packed to the cap with predictability
, leading tothe veyr little tension
, excitment
, suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience
. in short
, a clich
?
- ridden formula film
. welcome to my review of the general ' s daughter
. plot
: an undercover army detective
anbd a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig genaral daughter ' s rape
, torture
and murder
. they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules
and the hush
- hushes
, to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder
. critique
: by the numbers
( see above
)
. this film is just there
. it sits htere on the big screen for a couple of hours
, floats around
, goes away
, hopefully never to be heard fomr again
. it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away
. it ' s as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree
. it ' s as action
- packed as a canadian curling tournament
. get the picture
? i sure doed
.
.
. it ' s too bad tyhat it took my friend
and i less than two minutes to figure outloud the entire plot
,
and to break down each scene befoer it was even completed
. easy as pie
. it ' s unfortunate beccause james woods
and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film
,
bu alas
, t ' was not to be
( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted
.
) woods chews it up in the few scenes that he ' s in
, travolta passes the test
, cromwell plays
, well
, cromwell
,
and stowe isnt window dressing with a smile
( mia since 12 monkeys
( 8
/ 10
) it seems
)
.
and htis predictability isn ' t reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men
, it runs deep inside eveyr one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen
. it ' s like riding a bike
. other scenarios which sponge out any tension
, suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually
" breaking down
" to the investigators without much reason given
, a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters
, as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly
,
and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west withthe a solid nomination for the
" best poore man ' s michael bay doing his best poor man ' s impression ofthe tony scott
"
( add two scenes with sunlight shineing through smoe half
- open shades for grit
and integrity
,
and an all
- out rainfall for the finale for further chaos
,
and you ' re a great director
. yawn
. yeah
, whatever tony
.
.
. i mean
, simon
.
)
and aren ' t we all sick of hearing about these army
" bad boys
"
and their overdone
" code of silence
"
