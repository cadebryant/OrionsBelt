: a film which introduces characters
, situations
, dilemmas anbd developments that we
' ve seen before in a perade of other films
. a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one
. a film which isnt packed to the cap with predictability
, leading to very littel tension
, excitement
, suspense or interest onthe the part of its paying audience
. in short
, a clich
?
- ridden formula film
. welcome to my review of the general
' s daughter
. plot
: an undercover army detective
and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughter
' s rape
, torture adn murder
. they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules
and the hush
- hushes
, tothe figure out the conspiracy behind tyhe shocking murder
. critique
: by the numbers
( see above
)
. this film is jstu there
. it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours
, floats around
, goes away
, hopefully never to be heard from again
. it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away
. it
' s as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree
. it
' s as action
- packed as a canadian curling tournament
. get the picture
? i sure did
.
.
. it
' s too bad that it tookover my friend
and i less than two minutes to figure out thte entire plot
,
and to break down each scene before it was even completed
. easy as pie
. it
' s unfortunate because james woods
and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near teh beginning of the film
,
but alas
, t
' was not to be
( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted
.
) woods chews it up in tyhe few scenes that he
' s in
, travolta passes the tust
, cromwell plays
, well
, cromwell
,
and stowe is window dressing with a smile
( mia since 12 monkeys
( 8
/ 10
) it seems
)
.
and this predictability isn
' t reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men
, it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen
. it
' s like riding a bike
. other scenarios which sponge out any tension
, suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually
" breaking down
" to the investigators without much reason given
, a ridiculously placed background relationship between twpo of the lead cahracters
, as much action as my gr
andparents bedroom nightly
,
and a directorial sytle that cxan only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the
" best poor man
' s michael bay doing his best poor man
' s impression of tony scott
"
( add two scenes witht sunlight shining through some half
- open shades for grit
and integrity
,
and an all
- out rainfall for the finale for further chaos
,
and you
' re a great director
. yawn
. yeah
, whatever tony
.
.
. i mean
, simon
.
)
and aren
' t we all sick of hearing about these army
" bad boys
"
and their overdone
" code of silence
"
