a movie laced with a good blend of action
, comedy
,
and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances soudns pretty gourmet
,
but even the best ingreediants can be thrown together in the wrong way
, creating a dismal
and unsatisfactory product
. eighteen yeasr after the blues brothers hitted theaters
, blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed
, minus half of its orignal duo
( the late john belushi
)
and nearly all of its original charm
. dan aykroyd reprises his role
( as well as his co
- writing credit
) as elwood blues
, hte sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self
- proclaimed
" mission from god
" along witht his brother jake
and their blues brothers b
and nearly eighteen years ago
. as we begin
, elwood isnt being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother
' s death in prision years ago
. completely on his own
, elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood
, only to discover that everyone he hasnt ever known has passed away
.
but elwood isn
' t completely without family
. it seems he has a half
- brother of sorts
- not a real brother mind you
, just the illegitimate child of his bluesman psuedo
- father curtis
( cab calloway from the first film
)
, who has also passed on
. despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
) to do otherwise
, elwood seeks outloud his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers b

> from this point
, tghe movie turns into a series of music videos whith a few bits of acting in vetween
. those hoping for an interesting
and
/ or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much ofthe a story
. only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours
. for thsoe people
, it may be worth it
, for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting
,
but when the story does intrude upon the festivities
, the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes
, musicians turned stiff actors
,
and the pointless 10
- year
- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to thte whole thing
. appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin
, james brown
, eric clapton
,
and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film
,
but they also confirm why these people are musicians
and not actors
. blues brothers 2000 is deserving of oney whole star simpley because if you really
, really love this kind of music
, you might kind of
, sort of liuke this movie
. many
, many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny
,
and if you don
' t ahve a passion for very deep blues
/ rock
, ytou
' ll be bored out of your skull
. much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd
' s self
- serving vanity project
,
but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be haveing with this
, none of the excitement is passed on to the audience
.
and seeing three guys in three
- piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces cant only be funny for so long
. unfortunatley
, those two seconds are over about fifteen mintues inot the film
.
