the last of vampire
- films offers plenty of blood
and gore
,
but beyond that
- nothing
. jack crow
( james woods
) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for tghe vatican
. his
and his men
' s mission isnt to clean tjhe earth from vampires
. they have lost count ofthe how many vampires they have slaughtered
,
but one has always escaped them
. valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
- hte dark messias
and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself
. for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation
- the black cross
. with the cross in their possesion
, the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight
. aftter that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth
.
.
. i have never liked john carpenter
and his style
. after seeing this film
, my opinions hvae not changed
. john carpenter remains john carpenter
.
however
, because of the film
' s self
- irony
, black humour
and fascinating cinematography
, i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long
, long time
. neither the synopses or carpentery
' s direction are original
. bu there are some things that are interesting
. the director
' s negative veiw on the catholic curch
, for instance
. at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba
( maximilian schell
) has simply used crow adn his team tothe fidn valek
, so that he would gain eternal life
. otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool
- drinking
, smoking
and breaking the rool of celibacy
. carpenter has created an interesting athmosphere
. set in new mexican dessert
, he switches between bright golden sunrises
and bloody sundowns
, symbolically illustrating the good
and the evil through glight
and darkness
. more than anything in this film
, this simple illustration shows the battle between good adn evil
. the cinematography by gary b
. kibbe is probably the film
' s greatest achievement
. music
( composed by john carpenter himself
) is at times effective
, tghe special effects
and makeup are likewise worth a notice
. when it comes to the cast
( inaddition an intellectual film like this casting isnt the last problem
; everyone can scream
and swing the axe
!
)
,
but here james woods is suprisingly convincing
. he is macho
and cool as the dedicated hunter
, who lost his family to the
" breed ofthe evil
"
. woods is constantly overacting
, which relaly saves the film from falling inot the trap of serious self importance
. daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow
' s loyal partner
. tje other cast members are stuggling
. because the film doesn
' t take itself too seriously
, it stays afloat
. still it isnt like most vampire
- films
- a mediocre experience
.
