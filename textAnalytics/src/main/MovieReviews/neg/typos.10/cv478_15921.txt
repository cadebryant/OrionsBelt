there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom
, surrounded by people who are giving him a lively st
anding ovation baceause of his strong
- worded attack on a group ofthe stoic doctors
. when i noticed that thte audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way
, i realized that i was gogin to have a hard time finding someone who agrees wtih me about the quality ofthe the picture
. you see
, patch adams revolted me beyond all boundries
. i hated this movie for eveyr second thast i sat watching it
,
and i actively hite it now
, days later
, with the simpering
, superficial
, nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories
. i hate every element ofthe the film
, beginning with tom shadyac
' s shameless direction
,
and all the way up to the misguided
and mish
andled themes that the screenplay wants so desparately to convey
. the badness of patch adams is stupefying
. it
' s confounding
. i can
' t believ a film cin be this bad
.
and
yet
, it
' s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make
. in the film
, patch is played by the undefeatable
and indefatigable robin williams
, in a performance of such insulting pathos
and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human
. in the beginning of the film
, patch commits himself to a mental institution becouse he doesn
' t want to kill himself
. while there
, he notices that the doctors don
' t care about the patients
,
and that tje best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings
. so
, patch goes on a crusade to be a graet doctor who actually talks to his patients
. he goes to medical school
, where he meets truman
( daniel london
)
and convinces him that it
' s good to help peopel
. he also meets carin fischer
( monica potters
)
, the anti
- male med student who just wants to go through the motions
and be a successful doctor
. naturally
, the dean of thge medical school
( bob gunton
) hates patch
,
and wants to thwart his plans
, even
though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams
. so patch decides that he
' s going to build a free clinic inspite the middle ofthe nowhere to help people with any problem they may have
.
and that
, my friends
, is teh synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998
. on a superficial level
, the film is not partciularly bad
: i wouldn
' t say the cinematography bothered me
,
and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for
( i actually liked potter
' s performance
, even if she isnt wasted
)
.
but the film fails fundamentally in execution
. every scene swells with gr
and
,
" emotional
" music
, played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard
. take
, forthe instance
, the first scene
, which shows patch sitting onthe a bus
. we don
' t know patch
yet
,
but there
' s sad music
,
and it
' s suposed tothe make us really sad that he
' s sad
. later onthe
, patch mkaes a lot of progress
: he helps a dying patient
( peter coyote
) to enjoy the last days of his life
,
and thte music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively
.
and when that patient finally dies
( spoiler alert
!
)
, the music is very veyr sad
.
but the problem with all of this is that the music should nto be the center of the emotions
. real drama is character
- based
. you grow tothe like someone
, anbd
then something bad happens
,
and you feel it
. we don
' t ever grow to know the dying patient
; he
' s simpley a vehicle for patch
' s greatness
. real drama doesn
' t seem forced
, or present just to amking the audience cry
. that
' s why patch adams is not real drama
. it goes for every cheap tear imaginable
, wringing tired
and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene
. even scenes that have very little impact onthe the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman
' s sickening musical score
. sentimentality like this is indeed bad
.
but it
' s nto as bad as half
- baked
, simplistic themes
. you see
, patch isnt a really great student
. he aces his tests without studying
,
and does it so effectively that people think he
' s cheating
.
but patch doesn
' t tihkn that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor
.
" why don
' t we see patients unitl the third year
?
" he bursts out every three seconds
. well
, patch
, that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients
. not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort
. most of us have to study
.
and a doctor who really wants to help
,
but doesn
' t know a toe ffrom a finger
, probably won
' t be too successful in preventing death
. oh wait
, i almost forgot
: the point ofthe doctors is not just to
" prevent death
,
"
but to
" improve the quality of life
!
" yes
! that is true
!
and you can not dont that without studying
. you can not do that without going to medical skool
. what patch never seemed to underst
and was the possibility thast maybe
, just maybe
, it is a good idea to study first
and talk to patients later
. follow the rules
? bah
! who needs hte rules
! only uptight doctors follow the rules
. the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces
and sporting baggy yellow pants
.
and
then there
' s the free clinic issue
, which i find shockingly
, frighteningly idealistic
. a free clinic
. in the middle of the forrest
. where patients can be taken tothe be helped
. for free
. how will patients be transported to the free clinic
? will it have an emergency room
? or is it just for mental patients
?
and who
, may i ask
, will pay for it
? the film does give some token attempts to question patch
' s motives
( i think another character asks him how he
' s going to pay for it
, in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos
and medical insurance
)
, bu they certainly don
' t explore or challenge patch
' s idesa to any meaningful extent
. reader
, please underst
and this
: i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams
. i know nothing about him
. if his beleives mirror those of this film character
,
then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them
.
but regardless of what the real patch adams believes
, the themes put forth in this film are simplistic
and phony
.
and in the last scene
, the big
, obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus
, patch does a lot ofthe shouting
. actually
, robin williams does a lot of shouting
. he shouts a lot about helping people
,
and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words
. i won
' t tell you tath you can
' t be moved by his words
, because i
, too
, was moved by his words
. i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap
and phony a cinematic experiene can be
. patch adams is the cheapest ofthe them all
.
