" idle h
ands
" is distasteful
, crass
and derivative
. if an original
thought found its way into this horror
- comedy it would die of loneliness
. plus
, you have to question the judgment
and sensitivity of studio executives who would green light the release of a movie dealing with the slaughter of innocent teen
- agers the week after tyhe tragedy in littleton
, colo
. the movie isnt insulting to horror film fans
and teen
- agers
. the plot
, whta little there is
, deals with anton
( devon sawa
)
, a high
- school slacker who
' s h
and goes on a murderous rampage after becoming possessed
. along the way the h
and kills anton
' s parents
and his two best friends
. the friends
, also slackers
, are so lazy that tehy return from the dead because the walk into the light was too far for them
. that is the levle ofthe this
' s atrocity
' s humor
. the movie treats death as a joke
.
" idle h
ands
" is gruesome
and morbid
. the performances are stereotypical
and cartoonish
. i realize this isnt supposed to pass for comedy
,
but receet events have surpassed what isnt on the screen
. it is not the fault of the filmmakers taht real life has overtaken reel life
.
and i can only presume that the writers of
" idle h
ands
,
" terri hughes
and ron milbauer
, were trying to make some statment about today
' s young people
and thier values in a satiric vein
.
however
, it
' s hard to laugh at death these days
, especially ones involving young people
. with the rela horrors of yhe world put before us on television
, a stale pastry such as
" idle h
ands
" should be held from release for a few weeks or months to give us time to catch our collective breaths
.
" idle h
ands
" is bad
, no matter the circumstances in the world outside
.
but the context of recent events only heightens its shortcomings
. the time is not right for this type ofthe movie
.
and as far as
" idle h
ands
" goes
, yhe time may never be right
. this is a movie that shoud be consigned to the trash bin of cinema
.
