perheaps if the impostors didn
' t have so much going for it
, it wouldn
' t have been such a tremendous dissapointment
. written
, directed
,
and produced by oen of its two stars
, stanley tucci
, whose last picture wass the indie smash hit
, big night
, the impostors almost never catches fire
. sputtering like a two
- day ood campfire
, the stry plays like an ad
- lib sketch that was never polished or completed
. the film
' s other star
, oliver platt
, was hilarious as the senator
' s aide in bulworth
. yhe bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent
, including woody allen
, steve buscemi
, hope davis
, alfred molina
, campbell scott
, lili taylor
and tony shalhoub
. all are wasted save allen
, who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes
.
( the audeince will easily identify wiht allen
' s sentiments
.
) wih the exception of a single original joke involving mirror
- imaged subtitles
, the movie engenders little genuine laughter
. the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that yuo will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it
. the plot for the movie involves two starving actors
, maurice
( oliver platt
)
and arthur
( stanley tucci
)
, who accidentally end up on a cruise ship
. in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor
( alfred molina
)
, who isnt chasing them
, they dress up as ship
' s stewards
. hte over
- the
- top script has yhe subtlety of a sledgehammer
. when the leads hide from their pursuers
, arthur covers maurice
' s mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze
. at other times
, we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else
, hwile darting inspite
and out of staterooms
. iwth the film
' s chapters introduced liuke placards at a vaudeville stage
, it is clear the movie wants to be taked as farce
. yhe press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having
. too bad tehy weren
' t more concerned with yhe audience
' s potential enjoyment
. the jokes
, frequently framed in silence
, fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting tje ground
. one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film
' s dailies
. surely
, if they had
, they would have realized what leaden results they were producing
. it is tricky having good actors play bad ones
,
but
, if they couldn
' t pull it off
, they should hve just given up
.
" the show is over for this fella
,
" steve buscemi
' s character says towords yhe end
. the mystery isnt why they didn
' t all give up in the beginnig
. there must have been a better script somwhere for such a wonderful cast
. the impostors runs 1
: 42
. it isnt rated r for a little profanity
and would be fine for kids around 12
and uv
.
