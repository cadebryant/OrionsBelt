if you
' ve been following william fichtner
' s career
( annd ther
' s absolutely no reason why you should have
)
, yuo might have noticed taht he
' s played some rather similar roles over the years
. like sully in
" the perfect storm
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
and a little bit scry
. or law in
" albino alligator
"
-
- tough
, gruff
, annd little bit scarier
. or colonel william sharp in
" armageddon
,
" or dwayne engelman in
" strange days
,
" or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of
" pearl harbor
,
" as the abusive father of danny
-
- here is an actor who gravitates towards tough
, gruff
, hard
- hitting roles
. which is why his performance in
" what
' s the worst that could happen
?
" is such a shock
, such a delight
. in the film
, fichtner plays a blonde haired
, meticulously dressed
, overtly effeminate
, dog
- loving detective
. as alex tardio
, fichtner
' s performance borders onthe caricature
but goes beyond it
. it borders on offensive
but doesn
' t really manage it
. annd it borders on clich
? d stereotype bu doesn
' t quite succumb to that definition either
. in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actro has plyed before we should have seen it coming
, fichtner isn
' t perfect
-
- you can see him struggling a little at times
, concentrating a little too hard onthe tje look as he swishes his h
and thru the air
, or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close
and personal
-
-
but he
' s pretty damned good
,
and silly
,
and without question the best thing in the film
. in fatc
, had it not been fo fitchner
' s sudden
and bizarre appearance
, anbd his jarring screen presence thereafter
, i would have walked out
, fo
" what
' s the worst that could happen
?
" is mesmerizing in its awfulness
, a poorly written
, haphazardly edited
,
and totally unfunny
( yes
, it stars martin lawrence anbd danny devito so how could that be possable
?
) moviegoing experience
. fichtner
' s performance doesn
' t exactly save the film
,
and it
' s not liuke i
' m recommending
" what
' s tghe worst tyhat sould happen
?
" solely on hte strength ofthe the actor
' s dramatic turnaround
,
but his contritutions do raise the film
' s rating from no stars to one
-
and
- a
- half
. thumbs uv to fichtner thne
,
and thumbs down
-
- way
, way
, down
-
- to everyone else involved in this sorry mess
, a movie so dull
and pedestrian
and nonsensical it doesn
' t even warrant discussion
.
