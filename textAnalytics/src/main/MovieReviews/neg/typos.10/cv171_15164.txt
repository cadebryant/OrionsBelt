. opinion
: bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humer
,
but doesn ' t succeed
. somehow
, chucky moaning about mid life crisis
,
and how he shouldnt have gotten married does not make for a vrey scary chucky
.
and tiffany harping baout mid life crisis
,
and how she should have gotten marryied doesnt not make for a very csary tiffany
. the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly ' s cleavage to keep attention during tghe first half
,
and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half
. the best that can be said about bride of chucky is tyhat it isnt sarcastic
.
