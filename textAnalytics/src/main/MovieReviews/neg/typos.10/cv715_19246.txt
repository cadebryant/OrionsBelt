if you haven ' t plunked down your hard
- earned money
yet for
" wild wild west
,
" the latest summer holiday offering from will smith
, let me say right now that your money will be better spended on a starbuck ' s frappacino or on a ben
& jerry ' s sundae
. these treats are great relief ffrom the summer heat
. in contrast
, this film made me simmer in disappointment
. i can accept the fact that summer movies tend tothe put more weight into special effects
and taht good stories
and flavorful characters usually take a bcak seat
. this was true of star wars episode i
,
but at least in that film
, the story
and the characters were still in the back seat
. iin thsi film
, they are no where to be foudn
. what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers
and foppish aristocrats
, lots of female extras who look like can
- can dancers
,
and a clunky
, 80
- foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula
. two men are asked to stop this threat
. one is artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, an inventor who uses his intellect
and array of disguises to best his opponents
. among his creations are false breasts
and the bulletproof vest
. the otehr man is jim west
( will smith
)
, who prefers teh shoot
- first
-
then
- shoot
- some
- more method of investigating
.
although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success
, their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate
, two
- man vaudevillian ect
. for example
, there isnt a scene where west
, being more debonair than the reserved gordon
, notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat
, which is what it is currenly filled with
.
" now touch my breast
,
" west syas
. gordon does so
and
then softly coos his approval
. i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness
. teh script fails to generate any sence of drama
, humer
, or fun for that matter
. i did enjoy kline ' s reserved performance
,
but was surprised at how much lattitude tehy gave to smith
. could it be that will smith isnt just so bankable that he ' s not even required to act
? it was as if the director was yelling
" will smith
, do your own thing
.
.
.
and action
!
" here ' s an example
. in this scene
, will smith is about to be hanged by a group of angry white people
. he must endear himselv to the crowd to escape
. the director yells
,
" will smith
, do your own thing
.
.
.
and action
!
" in another scene
, he has to masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades
.
" will smith
, do your own thing
.
.
.
and action
!
" worse still
, thge final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess
. there are cogs spinning
annd pulleys pulling
and levers going up
and down everywhere you look
. there ' s actually a lot of immagination at work in this film
. there are some genuinely clever inventions
and gizmos itnroduced
,
but all of this imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered
and dramatically flat
.
and that ' s too bad because if there wass more focus on the story rather than will smith just doing his ' thing
, ' this film might have been palatable
. as it turns out
,
" wild wild west
" is the wild
, wild worst
and receives my vote for biggest dissapointment of the year
.
