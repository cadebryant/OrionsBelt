if you haven
' t plunked down your hard
- earned money
yet for
" wild wild west
,
" the latest summer holiday offering from will smith
, let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck
' s frappacino or on a ben
& jerry
' s sundae
. these treats are great relief from the summer heat
. inthe contrast
, this film made me simmer inspite disappointment
. i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects anbd that good storise
and flavorful characters usually take a back seat
. this was true of star wars episode i
,
but at least in that film
, the story
and the characters were still in the back seat
. in this film
, they are no where to be found
. what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers annd foppish aristocrats
, lots of female extras who look like can
- can dancers
,
and a clunky
, 80
- foot tall instrument of distruction that resembes a mechanical tarantula
. two men are asked tothe stpo this threat
. one is artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, an inventer who uses his intellect
and array of disguises to best his opponents
. amoung his creations are false breasts
and the bulletproof vest
. the other man is jim west
( will smith
)
, who prefers the shoot
- firt
-
then
- shoot
- some
- more method of investigating
.
al
though their individual talents must be combined to achieve success
, their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate
, two
- man vaudevillian act
. for example
, there is a scene where west
, being more debonair thna the reserved gordon
, notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat
, which is wqat it is currently filled with
.
" now touch my breast
,
" west says
. gordon doesnt so
and
then softly coos his approval
. i foudn myself groaning at this kind of silliness
. the script fails tothe generate any sense of drama
, humor
, or fun for that matter
. i did enjoy kline
' s reserved performance
,
but was surprised at how much latitude they gavey to smith
. could it be that will smith is just so bankable that he
' s not even required to ect
? it was as if the director was yelling
" will smith
, do your own hting
.
.
.
and action
!
" here
' s an example
. in thsi scene
, will smith is about to be hanged by a gropu ofthe angry white people
. he must endear himself to the crowd to excape
. the director yells
,
" will smith
, do your own thing
.
.
.
and action
!
" in another scene
, he has tothe masquerade as a belly dancer in order to save his comrades
.
" will smith
, dont your own thing
.
.
.
and action
!
" worse still
, the final battle scene aboard the mechanical tarantula is a horrid mess
. there are cogs spinning
and pulleys pulling adn levers going uv
and down everywhere you look
. there
' s actually a lot of imagination at work in this film
. there are some genuinely clever inventions
and gizmos introduced
,
but all of htis imagination is wasted in a film that is visually cluttered
and dramatically flat
.
and that
' s too bad becuase if there was more focus on the story rather than iwll smith just doign his
' thing
,
' this film might have been palatable
. as it turns out
,
" wild wild west
" is the wild
, wild worst
and receives my vote for biggest disappointment of yhe year
.
