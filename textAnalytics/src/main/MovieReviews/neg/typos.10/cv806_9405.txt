in 1989
, tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman
adn turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that creaeted an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir
and tje godfather
. was it
" deep
"
? nope
.
however it was a perfect enteratinment
and the audience ate it up
. it was natrual that roger ebert trashed it writing that it wass
" wihtout the comic book uplift
" of the indiana jones
and superman pictures
. which was true
. if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man ' s escadapes
and adventures you were looking in the wrong place
. if those films were tom sawyer
,
then batman was huckleberry finn
. some critics
( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news
and peter travers of rolling stone
) realized thgat it was something special
; mr
. lovell gave it
*
*
* 1
/ 2
and wroet tyhat
" this is batman as batman shoudl be
.
"
; mr
. travers called it one of tje ten best films of the year
. the praise was deserved
- from start to finish the film was enthralling
, exciting
,
and superb in every respect
. there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton
. thge result was batman returns which forgets that it wants tothe be fun within the first five minutes
. the villains
( the hideous penguin
and seductive catwoman
) take over
,
and our epectations are always left unfulfilled
- when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman ' s nose he simply gets mad
,
and when we want catwoman to slither over batman ' s body she gets pushed off a building
. i admire mr
. burton for trying to do more
then entertain
,
bu the result is a mess
. nothing works out as planned
- it fails both to entertain
and to enlighten
. hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast
. alas
, these are only hints
. there are
, don ' t misunderstand me
, several moments of cinematic genuis contained
; catwoman
and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said
; christopher lloyd is trapped
, by the penguin
, within a giant cage
; a small basket is dropped into a large river
;
but nothing is drawn together
and burton is unable to make thte film wokr on any regular basis
. a weak followup
, both career
and sequel wise
, batman returns is sometimes dazzling
,
but to often dissapointing
.
