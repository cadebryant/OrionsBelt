in 1989
, tim burton took the legendary comic book figure ofthe batman annd turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that creaeted an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir annd the godfather
. was it
" deep
"
? nope
.
however it was a perfect enteratinment adn the audience ate it up
. it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing taht it was
" without the comic book uplift
" of thge indiana jones
and superman pictures
. which was true
. if what you were looking for ws the tale of a heroic man
' s escadapes
and adventures you were looking in the wrong place
. if those films were toom sawyer
,
then batman wass huckleberry finn
. some critics
( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news
and peter travers of rolling stone
) realized that it was something special
; mr
. lovell gave it
*
*
* 1
/ 2
and wrote that
" this isnt batman as batman should be
.
"
; mr
. travers called it one of thge ten best films of the year
. the praise was deserved
- from start to finish the film was enthralling
, exciting
,
and superb in every respect
. there was no doubt that ther woudl be a sequel directed by burton
. the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be funn within the first five minutes
. the villains
( the hideous penguin
and seductive catwoman
) take over
,
and our epectations are allways left unfulfilled
- when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman
' s nose he simply gets mad
,
and when we want catwoman to slither over batman
' s body she gets pushed off a building
. i admire mr
. burton for trying tothe do more
then entertain
,
but the result is a mess
. nothing works out as planned
- it fails both to entertain
and to enlighten
. hints are made tothe the audience that this film could be a blast
. alas
, these are only hints
. there are
, don
' t misunderst
and me
, several moments ofthe cinematic genuis contained
; catwoman
and batman underst
and eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said
; christopher lloyd is trapped
, by the penguin
, within a giant cage
; a small basket is dropped into a large river
;
but nothing is drawn toghether
and burton isnt unable to make the film work on any regular basis
. a weak followup
, both career
and sequal wise
, batman returns is sometimes dazzling
, bu to often dissapointing
.
