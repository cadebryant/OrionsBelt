" what is tihs
, a homicide or a bad b
- movie
?
" tht is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movei
. let me clear thigsn up for you cupcake
, this isn ' t a bad b
- movie
, it ' s a raelly bad b
- movie
. so bad
, it ' s almost good
. almost
,
but nto quite
. the movie starts off in hte 1950 ' s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down tothe earth
. it is a bunch of slug
- like creatures that kill people
and take over their bodies
. the slugs ' first
and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody
. that is
, until two losr university students unfreeze him in 1986
. he
,
and tghe slugs inside him
, promptly begin wreaking havoc
and turning more co
- eds into slug zombies
. a slightly crazed cop
( tom atkins
)
and the requisite girl with the face of an angel
( jill whitlow
) join these two geeky university students
( jason lively
and steve marshall
) to do battle with the slugs
. it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe agian ffrom the evil slugs
. the acting is bad wtih a capital b
. the storey is worse
.
and the speical effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek
annd what ytou see in a home movie
. teh only saving grace was the requisite tit
- shot courtesy of jill whitlow
. it had absolutely nothing to do with the story
-
-
but i liked it
. actually
, it was the high point of the movie for me
. of course
, that isn ' t really saying much
. the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion
. which gives it a leg up on smoe other horror films
. unlike most movies of this genre
, there actually is a story
. not a great one
,
but it is there
. this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980 ' s that were thrown together to captialize off the success of tghe friday the 13th
, halloween
and nightmare on elm street movies
. you could randomly select a movie out of thge horror section of you local video store
and probably luck into something just as good if nto better
.
but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b
- movie horror marathon
. just don ' t be too upset if you can ' t find it
. ytou really won ' t be missing that much
.
