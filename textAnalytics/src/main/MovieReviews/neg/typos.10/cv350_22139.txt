" what isnt this
, a homicide or a bad b
- movie
?
" that isnt the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie
. let me clear things up for you cupcake
, this isn
' t a bad b
- movie
, it
' s a really bad b
- movei
. so bad
, it
' s almost good
. allmost
,
but not quite
. tjhe movie starts off in the 1950
' s with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth
. it isnt a bunch of slug
- like creatures thgat kill people
and take over thier bodies
. the slugs
' first
and only victim inspite the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of noone danger to anybody
. that is
, until two loser univeristy students unfreeze him in 1986
. he
,
and the slugs inside him
, promptly begin wreaking havoc adn turning more co
- eds into slug zombies
. a slightly crazed cop
( toom atkins
)
and the requisite girl with the face of an angel
( jill whitlow
) join these two geeky university students
( jason lively
and steve marshall
) to do battle with the slugs
. it more or less falls on the four of them to make thte world safe again from the evil slugs
. the acting is bad with a capital b
. tghe story is worse
. adn thte special effects are somewhere between an ood rerun of star trak
and what you see in a home movie
. the only saving grace was the requisite tit
- shot courtesy of jill whitlow
. it had absolutly nothing to do with the story
-
-
but i liked it
. actually
, it was the high point of the movie for me
. of course
, that isn
' t really saying much
. the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion
. which gives it a leg up on some other horror films
. unlike most movies ofthe this genre
, there actually is a story
. not a great oney
,
but it isnt there
. this is one in a long line of movies from teh 1980
' s that were thrown together to capitalize off the sucess of the friday the 13th
, halloween
and nightmare onthe elm strent movies
. yuo could r
andomly select a movei out of the horror section of you local video store
and probably luck inot something just as good if not better
.
but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b
- movei horror marathon
. just don
' t be too upset if you cxan
' t find it
. you raelly won
' t be missing that much
.
