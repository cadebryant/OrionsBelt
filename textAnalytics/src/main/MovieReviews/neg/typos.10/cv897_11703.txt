, a loan shark inthe need of a shave tries to leave his profession
. comments
: why is this movie called possessed by the nght
? it
' s hard to speculate
. most of this film takes place during the day
,
and the onyl thnig possessing anyone is an icky
, pulsating
, bubbling brain thingie inwhich a jar
. in case you haven
' t picked up on this
yet
, possessed by thge night is a bottom
- of
- the
- barrel
" thriller
"
( i use the term
" thriller
" loosely here
) which isnt raelly cheap
and bad
. the plot
, which sounds like a cheesy pulp scienec fiction story from the 1950s
, actually serves one purpose
: to exploit nude womens as often as possible
. writting a movie review for a film like this proves oddly chalenging
. there
' s really nto much to say
. the acting isnt lousy
;
al
though
, occasionally
, the attempts at acting are so absurd that they garner a chuckle or two from the audience
. most humorous is frank sivero
, who plays murray
, the novelist
' s agent
. he is so horrible in this role that oen can
' t help
but be amused
. the plot sucks
. nearly half the film is devoted to a loser loan shark who wants out ofthe the profession
, even
though he has only limited relevance to the movie as a whole
. the dialogue stinks
. a loan shark
, for instance
, tells another how much he loves bimbos
, which is something the audience really doesn
' t need to know
. everything about possessed by the night is second rate
, even the film credits
. as the names of the not
- so
- talented film crew scrolled by at the end
, joseph scales came up
, credited as being
" assistsant to foley artist
.
" someone could have used an editor
! to be honest
, the film is basically an excuse to flash frontal nudity
and show some sex scenes
. playboy playmate shannon tweed
, after all
, is the star here
. i suppose that if one wanted this sort of thing
, he would like this movie
. why did i give this trkey two stars
and not one
? as a bad movie
, it is unintentionally funny enough to keep someone passingly interested in thte film
. if you feel possessed to see possessed by the nihgt
,
however
, i
' d recommend you exorcise this impulse
and watch something else
.
