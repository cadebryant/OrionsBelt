" flubber
" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation
,
and hysterically enought both were distri
buted by disney
. it
' s tjhe kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids
,
but anyone else will feel left out as it
' s boring
, slow
,
and incredibly lifeless
. what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water
, anbd it
' s a shame because it could have been a great film
. hypothetically
, i mean
.
" flubber
,
" as you probably know
, is a remake of the disney clasic i never saw
,
" the absent minded professor
,
" where a
, well
, absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an eratic substance known as
" flubber
,
" you know
, flying rubber
? the new one keesh the basic plot
,
but appears to have added a lot else
, like more absent
- mindedness on the part of hte proffessor
, some more villains
,
and several
" show
- stopping
" moments
, like a big rumba whith the flubber
,
and some more elaborate setups
, none which really mkea it any better
,
but instead make it worse
. the basic plot revolves around a college professor
, philip brainerd
( robin williams
)
, who creates lots
and lots of inventions
,
but is sadly absent minded
. in fatc
, he
' s forgotten his wedding to the college
' s president
, sara jean reynolds
( indie actress marcia gay harden
)
, two times before he forgets it again at the beginning
. doesn
' t this warrant some kind of mental treatment
? anyway
, onthe his wedding day
( the third one
)
, he invents the flubber
, which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed
,
but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in
" hte abyss
.
" philip believes that this invention
, once fully realized
, will save his college
, which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon
/ villain
, chester hoenicker
( raymond j
. barry
)
, whcih is ironically enough the smae college his brat son
( will wheaton
- throught he was dead
) goes to
. through a plot twist
, hoenicker
' s goons
, named smith
and wesson
( ha ha
- what a great sense of humer this film has
) who are played by clancy brown
and ted levine
( both who needed the pay check
)
, discover it the hard way
,
and try to steal for hoenicker
, who wants it just
' cause he
' s evil enough
. a sub
- plot involves philip
' s attempts to win back sara
, who
' s angry at him
(
and with good reason
)
,
but who is being seduced by who is basically philip
' s belloq
, wilson croft
( christopher mcdonald
, playing the hysterically suave
-
yet
- unsuave asswhole once again
)
.
and in another subplot
, philip
' s day
- timer robot
, weebo
( voiced by the one
-
and
- only jodi benson
)
, falls in love with him
. yuckity
- yuck
. wqat
' s most pathetic about this film is how dull it is
. you don
' t need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film
, which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney
, who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry
, half
- assedly re
- mixing classics
( or non
- classics
) forthe distri
bution to the genaral public
, who sadly eats it all up
. earlier in
' 97
, they released
" jungle 2 jungle
,
" an adaptation of a really awful french film
,
" un indien dans la ville
,
" which
, yeah
, improved over the original
,
but not by much
. disney
' s in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now
, only creatively
. in the rush tothe ship out a film for distri
bution
, disney has forgotten to give this film a littel thing called
" magic
.
" such scenes as dancing flubber
, a flying car
, a basketball team thyat pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber
,
and an elaborite ending all fail to amaze
, delight
, or even cause people to laugh
. i sat there the entire film stone faced
, chuckling perhaps twice
,
and shaking my head at all the bad jokes
. who coudl really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom
and starts teaching chemestry
? didn
' t think so
. it doesn
' t help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable
. philip is not a lovable absent minded professory
, just a really dumb man being played by robin williams
. williams is a brilliant comic actor
.
.
. okay
, a brilliant actor infact general
,
but here he
' s given very little to dont
but occasionally get hyper over something
,
and other times act sad
. those times
, he
' s not bad
.
but what are we supposed to think of a man who
' s forgotten his wedding thrice
? maybe it was funny
and
/ or respectable inwhich the 60s
.
.
. i liek disney
,
and i usually enjoy their films
, not only animated
but live action
, anbd their recent films
( save for
" hercules
,
" which was good
,
but not grat
) have been worse than lackluster
, they
' ve been pathetic
.
" jungle 2 jungle
" is probably the worst film i saw last year
.
" flubber
"
' s probably second
. wqat do they need to do
? perhaps create something new
. get writers who can write something that
' s universally intertaining
. films like
" the parent trap
"
and
" mary poppins
" are films tath are live action
( or in the latter case a mix of both
)
,
but even i can still watch them because they
' re not only written to be magical to children
,
but tothe be fun tothe adults
. what
' s more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you
and annoys you at every turn
? anbd my god
, couldn
' t they have done something else with edie mcclurg
?
