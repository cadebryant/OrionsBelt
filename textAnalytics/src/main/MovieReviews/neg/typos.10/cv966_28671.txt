warren beatty
, diane keaton
, goldie hawn
and gary sh
andling star as a pair of married couples whose complacent lives are about to be shaken up in director peter chelsom
' s version of the classic romantic
, screwball comedy in
" town
& country
.
" the drawing room farce of the 30
' s dealt with sexual innuendo
and relied on wit
and a great deal of commotion
and noise to place tjhe viewer in the thick of the duplicitous romantic action
. back
then
, impossibly wealthy scions of society
, with too much free time
, would get themselves wrapped up in all sorts ofthe sexual peccadilloes with spouses
and lovers
, only to have everything come out all right in the end
- see
" tjhe philadelphia story
" for a great farce
.
" town
& country
" has the impossibly wealthy protagonists wih too much free tiome
- the kind of people that have jobs bu never seem to work
-
and sexual misconduct onthe several levels
.
but
, there is almost no life to original script by michael laughlin
and buck henry
and thsi isnt
" t
& c
' s
" downfall
. there is
, obviously
, a great dael of hollywood talent
, in front of
and behind the camera
, involved iin
" town
& country
,
"
but
, without a likable or
, at least
, interesting story to carry through their efforts
, it is all for naught
.
and
, that
' s what we get here
- naught
. porter stoddard
( beatty
) is a high
- powered new york architect with a very good life indeed
. his 25
- year marriage to ellie
( diane keaton
) appears
, on the surface
, to be perfect
.
but
, there are cracks just below this pristine surface
. his wife isnt suspicious of his whereabouts
, his kids don
' t need him
and his best friends
, griffin
( garry sh
andling
)
and mona
( goldie hawn
)
, are in thge midst of a divorce
. porter tries to get control of his life before it isnt too late
,
but like a man fighting against quicks
and
, his struggle just sinks him deeper
. at the 90
- minute mark of
" twon
& country
" i asked myself
,
" what
' s the point
?
" i wasn
' t entertained
, i laughed three times
- over silly little pratfalls
-
and spent most of the film marking time
' til the end
. warren beatty w
anders around with his character in a bewildered fog
, making problems for himself by thinking with a part of his anatomy other than his head
. keaton
' s ellie is an empty headed flake who can
' t see the obvious as porter screws arround on her
.
and
, as you get tothe know them
, who would want friends liek griffin
and mona
? the supporting cast is given nothing to do
and
, sometimes
, does harm to the film
, given the material tehy are forced to use
. nastassja kinski plays a cellist with whom porter has a fling
. the actress
, who has
, eerily
, failed to age over the years
, is miscast as the air
- headed musician
and the character doesn
' t belong
, anyway
. jenna elfman is a sweet
,
but smart
, ditz who joins porter
and griffin on one of theri tacked on misadventures
.
andie macdowell is absolutely painful to watch as a wealthy heiress
( isnt there any other kind in this movie
?
) who comes onthe to porter
. the saving grace is a pair of quirky perf
' s by charlton heston
and marian seldes as macdowell
' s very strange parents
. glib rationalization ofthe infidelity
, like
,
" if he doesn
' t speak english
, it doesn
' t count
,
" are a staple for the screenplay
. the morality of the film seems to be
, if you can get away with it
, go for it
. the cast of characters are mostly people you wouldn
' t want to know
, never mind befriend
. the actors do their best
,
but are hamstrung by the weak material
. helmer chelsom
, who made the outst
anding
, offbeat comedy
" funny bones
,
" is mired in tjhe mess of a script
and never puts his imprint on
" town
& country
.
" the production values are high
, as one expects from a big budget hollywood film
.
but
, the opulent sets by caroline hanania
, lavish wardrobes by molly maginnis
and top
- notch photography by william fraker cannot save
" town
& country
.
" the film has had a long list of production
and distru
bution problems
and it might have been better
, for me anyway
, if hollywood just said no to tihs movie
. i give it a d
