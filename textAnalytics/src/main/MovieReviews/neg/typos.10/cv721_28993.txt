tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories baout outcast individuals yearning for acceptance
, anbd into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi
- tiered marketing materials for crap movies
.
and here he hits rock bottom
, with planet of the apes
. i didn
' t expect much from this latest
" interpretation
" ofthe pierre boulle
' s classic novel planet of tyhe apes
. i mean
, how could you top the force
and impact of the original film
, intelligently co
- scripted by rod serling
( of twilight zone fame
) combined with thte overbearing chuck heston growling
and yelling at those
" damn dirty apes
,
" in one of his best roles of his carreer
? sadly
, i sat down to watch burton
' s version ofthe planet of the apes
and within the first 20 minutes
, i was checking my watch
and my girlfriend
( a big fan ofthe the original film
) started tothe nod off
. this time around
, the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine
, braveheart
,
and project x
. marky mark wahlberg
, who was enjoyable inwhich boogie nights
and the corrupter
, plays leo davidson
, a hot shot u
. s
. air force pilot
. leo
and his crew are in serch of some mysterious magnetic storms
( no real explanation given in the film
)
and leo sends one of his genetically altered
" smart
" chimps into the storms to collect data
. leo
and his crew lose communication whith the chimp
, leo hops in another ship to find the monkey
,
and
then he
' s thrown through some type of time
- space wormhole which crashes l
ands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot
, all mocked uv to look like tghe amazon jungle
. leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes
and isnt sold to a slave trader named limbo
( paul giamatti
) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari
( helena bonham carter
)
. the kind ari
then helps leo adn his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo
' s ship
. along the way
, monkeys played by tim roth
( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade
)
and michael clarke duncan
( who furhter enhances his career by palying another heavy in a bad action movie
) strive outloud to hunt down leo
and his b
and of human savages
, just like battlefield earth
! in the end
, it all culminates into another braveheart rip
- off human versus ape battle scene
. while rick baker
' s makeup work is amazing
, the script is a pathetic hodgepodge
( courtesy ofthe threee writers
)
, the acting is horrible
,
and the
" surprise
" ending fiels like a swing from a ball
- peen hammer into the temple
. wahlberg does nto have the physical or mental presence ofthe a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences
. this remake
, or re
- interpretation
, as tim burton has proclaimed it
, is an insult to the intelligence
and wit of the original film
. the ethical arguments about the equality of species
, fascism
,
and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue
, an unimaginative narrative structure
, adn a romance between a monkey
and a human
. even chuck heston
' s anti
- gun tirade
( in the de rigeur cameo
) seems shallow
and jokey
.
but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton
. even
though his name is plastered across every billboard in america
, john badham could have directed this film
. even joel schumacher could have directed this film
. he probably shoud ahev
. burton
' s predominant themes of rejection
, isolation
, anbd the search for one
' s place in the universe
, as seen in ed wood
, edward scissorsh
ands
,
and pee
- wee
' s big adventure
, are completely absent in this planet
. i suppose that
' s what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole
