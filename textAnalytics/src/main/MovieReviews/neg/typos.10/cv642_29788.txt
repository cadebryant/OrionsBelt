the noe question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film
. since june
, i haven
' t been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies wihtout getting hit by smoe ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky
, shrieking outloud a
- ha
' s
" take on me
" in his yellow miata
. why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine
? honestly
, i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actualyl a front for a decently funny movie
. man
, was i wrong
. corky romano is one of those throwaway
, clich
?
- ridden tv
- star
- to
- film vehicles builded upon tyhe most rickety of plots
. fortunately for chris kattan
' s precariously positioned career
, corky does haev some good laughs
, even if most of them are of the lowest
- brow variety
. kattan plays the title character
, the unsinkable assitant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny
' 80s tunes
, bright ties
, anbd banal coffee mug slogans
(
" you don
' t have to be crazy to work here
,
but it sure helps
.
"
)
. whn his mob boss dad
( peter falk
) is about to be put away on murder charges
, his bungling
, lughead brothers
( peter berg
and chris penn
) rope in innocent
, black sheeps corky to inflitrate the fbi as an agent anbd steal the evidence
. predictably
, hijinks ensue
. if the basic plot sounds bad
, wait untli yuo get into thge inner
- workings of this clunker
. the writers will amaze you with the depth of thier inanity
. corky
' s fbi agent identity is named corky pissant
(
" thgat
' s pronounced pees
- ahn
. it
' s french
.
"
)
. he becomes a frist
- rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr
. magoo
- style onto the proper clues
and talking his way in
and out of situations
, which plays like something outloud ofthe a sitcom
.
and not a good sitcom
, i mean
. the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other
' s face
.
and in a scene taken straight from there
' s something about mary
, corky gives a dachshund mouth
- to
- mouth resuscitation
.
but it
' s not a complete disaster
. the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments
, including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus adn another involving schoolchildren
, a german shephard
,
and a kilo of cocaine
. plus
, berg
-
- whose carreer hasnt obviously gone downhill since the last seduction
and chicago hope
-
- gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie
.
and
, it
' s nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work
. unfortunately for those out there who can
' t truly appreciate animal or fart jokes
, corky won
' t have much to offer you
. so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv
, asking
,
" who is corky
?
" you can simply reply
,
" who cares
?
