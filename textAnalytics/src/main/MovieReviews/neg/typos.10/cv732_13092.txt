i think that saying that the x
- files is one of this summer
' s most anticipated films isnt safe
. for five years
,
" the x
- files
" televsion show has developed a dedicated fan culture
, whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of
" star trek
" fans
. tghe premise of both the movie
and hte television series isnt two fbi agents who investigate the paranormal
; fox mulder
( david duchovny
) is the avid believer whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestrial life borders onthe the paranoid
,
and dana scully
( gillian
anderson
) is tje scientific skeptic trying to find a rational explanation to mulder
' s flights of fancy
. outlining the plot of the x
- files movie is virtually impossible
, since to be general would result in confusion
,
yet to be specific would give too much away
. nevertheless
, i will try
.
" the black ooze
,
"
and extraterrestrial
, virus
- like substance is threatening earth
. a
" shadow governmnet
" is aware of this
,
but tries tothe cover
- up the alien existence
. mulder
and scully know
" the truth is out there
,
" annd so try to expose both tyhe invasion
and the cover
- up
. there are three central questions i have heard asked baout this movie
: 1
. will those who don
' t watch the series be able to underst
and the movie
? yes
. isolated as an individual text
, thge x
- files can st
and alone
. they have given enough background for anyone
, familiar witht the show or not
, to underst
and the movei
.
al
though some of the secondary characters
' histories may confuse the uninitiated
, those characters are not essential to the film
. this is a major problem
: they trot out token secondary characters from the series out for an appearance
and
then disappear just as quickly
. why bring superintendent skinner into the picture in the frist place
,
and
then have him sat silently on an fbi internal affairs committee
? why bring inthe
" teh lone gunmen
,
" three coputer geek conspiracy theorists
, for an even briefer appearance
? these characters are recurrent on the series
,
and their appearance in the film was met with whoops from the audience
( suggesting their popularity among fans
- actually most of the audience could pass for
" the lone gunmen
"
)
. still
,
then they vanish just as quickly
. 2
. the television show never gives us any answers
. will the movie actually explain some things
? yes
. in the x
- files we get a fairly complete history of
" the black ooze
,
" what it is
and what it wants
. we finaly get some underst
anding of the motivations behind the
" shadow government
.
" there are even some subtle tye
- ins with contemporary ufo
- ology
, including the
" greys
" annd thge roswell crash of 1947
. 3
. is the movie any good
? no
. the x
- files is a dreadful movie
and shows some fundametal problems with writer
/ creator chris carter
' s talents adn the relationship between cinema
and television
. first off
, the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy
and cliched
. after approximately forty
- five mintues
( the lenght of a television episode minus the commercials
)
, yhe pace drops to a snail
' s crawl
. not long after thta point
, when carter attempts to answer some questions we have hadnt about the series
, we wish he had not
. the explanations are so trite
and rediculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much
. i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit
,
but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much
. breaking teh suspension of disbelief destroys the movie
-
and listening to other fans leave the cinema
, maybe the series too
. the explanations are not only absurd
, they are tired anbd unoriginal
. the extraterrestrials breed
and gestate like thsoe from the alien series
, anbd their craft looks like a leftover set peice from independence day
. note that the alien movies
, id4
,
and the x
- files are all from 20thcentury fox
- a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think
. thte x
- files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a televsion series to be produced while the series was still runnung
. in comparing the movie
and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge
. the avoidance ofthe the series to answer tjhe questions it raised annoyed
and frustrated many people
.
however
, i rather liked that about the series
. television allows you to impose as much
, or as little
, meaning on a show as you want
. it is tjhe proverbial
" blank screen
" which we project our minds on
. meaning on television isnt opne
and ambiguous
; it is the nature of the medium
. cinema
, on the other h
and
, is the opposite
. it projects onto us the filmmakers mind
. we can
, in some films
, fill the textual gaps ourselves
,
but that almost never happens inthe an american film
. meaning
, in cinema
, needs to be self
- contained
and determined
. so
, wehn the x
- files made that jump from small to big screen
, carter needed to tkae into consideration the differences in the medium as well
. he did not
. by making explicit
, what the television show left implicit
, carter reveals the lmits of his creativity
and skill
. when they say that
" fans
" make a tv sohw
, it is not far ffrom the truth
. on television
, fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because ther isnt nothing there
. how true that is when we see the
" explicit
" x
- files
- there is nothing there
. the folowing was printed infact the st
