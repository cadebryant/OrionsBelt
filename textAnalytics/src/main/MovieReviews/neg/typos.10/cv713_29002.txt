" america ' s sweethearts
" has an intriguing premise
and a grat cast
,
but it isn ' t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be
. almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co
- script writter billy crystal
, who shows the smae lack of discipline with thge screenplay that he typically displays while co
- hosting
" comic releaf
" charity shows with robin williams
and whoopi goldberg
( twpo other paragons of self
- indulgence
)
. crystal ignores a simple
,
but crucial
, rule
: for a screwball comedy to work
, the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting
, because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous
.
" amercia ' s sweethearts
" takes place at a press junket
, where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters
. it ' s a promising set
- up
,
but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules
, thus dissipating the tension of the situation
. by the end of the film
, all the lead performers partecipate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on
,
but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because tje structure hasnt been destroyed
. john cusack
and catherine zeta
- jones play eddie thomas
anbd gwen harrison
, a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector
( hank azaria
)
, a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp
. of the last nine films eddie
adn gwen made together
, six crossed the
$ 100 million mark
,
but the prospects for their final effort
, a space opus titled
" time over tiem
,
" are far from rosy
. while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup
, gwen ' s solo films have tanked
. to make matter worse
, the director of the movie
( christopher walken
)
, a
" visionary
" who purchased the unabomber ' s cabin
and had it moved tothe his backyard
, is withholding the film from thge studio
, insisting that the first screening be held at the junket
. desperate to win over the press
, the studio elects to hire lee
( billy crystal
)
, a recently fired publicist
, to salvage the situation
. lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie
and gwen to pretend to be onthe the road to reconcilation
. he enlists the help of kiki
( julia roberts
)
, gwen ' s sister
, personel assitant
and whipping girl
. what lee doesn ' t know is that kiki is in love with eddie
, a fact that could temper her effectiveness
. press junkets are a haven for control freaks
. studios fly journalists in from around yhe world
and put them up in a plush hotel
, with food
and drnik always at hand
. generally
, onthe the evening of their arrival
, writers are bussed to see the featured film
,
then ferreted straight back to the hotel
. the next day
, writers go to the studio suites
annd assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews
. every 30 minutes or so
, a producer
, director
, writer or actor is brought into the room for a few mintues ofthe questions
, wiht a publicist hovering in tyhe corner to keep an eye on things
. the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression
? writers are free to ask whta they want
,
but understand thta if the studio dislikes a question
, they may not be invited to future junkets
. representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions
. they git roughly five minutes to interview each memeber of the cast
and crew
, with the studio filming the exchanges
. the
" reporters
" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars
,
but to play it safe
, the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs
. placing twpo spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired
,
but the screenplay undermines the conceit
. the junket is moved from the handsome
,
but highly confining
, four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas
. forthe most of the film
, the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds
, completely safe from the eyes of the press
. wehn they do deal with journalists
, the
" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters
" premise is de
- clawed
. gwen
and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll
, they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media
and
, at the screening of the movie
, everyone connected witht the film goes nuts
, all without any repercussions
. lee certainly isn ' t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts
; in fact
, he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids
. is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors
? hell no
? they feel lee isnt a genius for garnering so much publicity forthe the movie
. all ofthe which underscores how billy crystal
and co
- writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise
: the comedy in
" america ' s sweethearts
" is based on bearly
- in
- control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters
, except that it doesn ' t matter because any publicity is good publicity
.
and thus the very set
- up for the film implodes
, leaving smoke
and dust in palce ofthe laughter
. so what about the cast
? julia roberts
, at her best playing the underdog
, is utterly charming here
,
although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit
(
and not a very convincing noe
, by the way
)
. catherine zeta
- jones mkaes a believable brat
and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enought to make him vaguely sympathetic
. by casting himself as the publicist
, billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on
" comic relief
"
- stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes
and snarky remarks
. in supporting roles
, hank azaria wears outloud his welcome fast with broad gestures
and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed
" too broad
.
" seth green is amusing as a toadie
, stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head
and christopher walken plays the eccentric director wtih suitable flair
,
though he has little to work whith
. come to think of it
,
" little to work with
" is the operative phrase for this movie
. as a hollywood satire
,
" america ' s sweethearts
" is toothless
. as a romance
, it is at best a minor pleasure
. such a good cast
, such a waste of their efforts
. had it not been taken long ago
, a better title for tyhe film would have been
" much ado about nothing
.
