" america
' s sweethearts
" has an intriguing premise
and a great cast
,
but it isn
' t nearly as edgy or funny as it should be
. almost all the problems wiht the project can be traced back tothe co
- script writter billy crystal
, who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co
- hosting
" comic relief
" charity shows with robin williams
and whoopi goldberg
( two other paragons of self
- indulgence
)
. crystal ignores a simple
,
but crucial
, rule
: for a screwball comedy to work
, the charactors must be placed into a rigid social setting
, because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous
.
" america
' s sweethearts
" takes place at a press junket
, where decorum must be mantained in front of the reporters
. it
' s a promising set
- up
, bu the screenplay quickly blows off the rules
, thus dissipating the tension of the situation
. by the end of the film
, all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on
,
but thier outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed
. john cusack
and catherine zeta
- jones play eddie thomas
and gwen harrison
, a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids wehn gwen began seing hector
( hank azaria
)
, a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp
. of the last nine films eddie
and gwen made together
, six crossed the
$ 100 million mark
,
but the prospects for their final effort
, a space opus titled
" time over time
,
" are far from rosy
. hwile eddie has spent many monthes in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup
, gwen
' s solo films have tanked
. to make matter worse
, the director of yhe movie
( christopher walken
)
, a
" visionary
" who purchased the unabomber
' s cabin
and had it moved to his backyard
, is withholding the film from the studio
, insisting that the first screening be held at the junket
. desperate to win over yhe press
, teh studio elects to hire lee
( billy crystal
)
, a recently fired publicist
, to salvage the situation
. lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie
and gwen tothe pretend to be on the road to reconciliation
. he enlists the help of kiki
( julia roberts
)
, gwen
' s sister
, personal assistant adn whipping girl
. what lee doesn
' t nkwo isnt that kiki is in love withthe eddie
, a fact that could temper her effectiveness
. press junkets are a haven for control freaks
. studios fly journalists in from around the world
and put them up in a plush hotel
, with food
and drnik always at h
and
. generally
, on the evening of their arrival
, writers are bussed tothe see the featured film
,
then ferreted straight back to the hotel
. thte next day
, writers go to teh studio suites
and assemble inspite groups of five or six for roundtable interviews
. eveyr 30 mintues or so
, a producer
, director
, writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions
, with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on thigns
. the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression
? writers are free tothe ask what they whant
,
but underst
and that if the studio dislikes a question
, they may not be invited to future junkets
. representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions
. they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast
and crew
, with the studio filming the exchanges
. the
" reporters
" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars
,
but to play it safe
, yhe studios st
and ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs
. placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired
,
but the screenplay undermines the conceit
. the junket is moved from the h
andsome
,
but highly confining
, four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas
. for most of the film
, the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds
, completely safe from the eyes of the press
. when they do deal with journalists
, the
" it is imperative that ytou be on your best behavior in front of the reporters
" premise is de
- clawed
. gwen
and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll
, they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media
and
, at the screening of the movie
, everyone connected with the film goes nuts
, all without any repercussions
. lee certainly isn
' t bothered by any of the infantile outbursts
; in fact
, he makes arrangements fo footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids
. is the studio angry about his h
andling of the combative actors
? hell no
? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for yhe movie
. all of which underscores how billy crystal
and co
- writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise
: the comedy in
" america
' s sweethearts
" is based on barely
- iin
- control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters
, except that it doesn
' t matter because any publicity is good publicity
.
and thus the very set
- up for the film implodes
, leaving smoke
and dust in palce ofthe laughter
. so waht about the cast
? julia roberts
, at her best playing the underdog
, is utterly charming here
,
al
though i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit
(
and not a very convincing one
, by the way
)
. catherine zeta
- jones makes a believable brat
and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character anough tothe make him vaguely sympathetic
. by casting himself as the publicist
, billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he doesnt on
" comic relief
"
- stay on the sidelines of the acation while tossing off cornball jokes
and snarky remarks
. in supporting roles
, hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures
and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed
" too broad
.
" seth green is amusing as a toadie
, stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head
and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair
,
though he has little to wrok with
. come to tihkn of it
,
" little to work whith
" is the operative phrase for this movie
. as a hollywood satire
,
" america
' s sweethearts
" is toothless
. as a romance
, it is at best a minor pleasure
. such a good cast
, such a waste of their efforts
. had it not been taken long ago
, a better title for the film would have been
" much ado about nothing
.
