there
' s no reason tothe doubt that donnie brasco is based
, as its opening credits proclaim
, on a true story
.
but if it
' s an accurate picture of life on america
' s mean streets
, than cinematic depictions of organised crime ahve had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously
thought
. for from thge film
' s outset
, when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles
( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading
) donnie brasco resembles more thna passingly a fewd gangster ficks once believed to be works of fiction
. our eponymous hero
( johnny depp
) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be
. brasco is joseph pistone
, an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming
- up to lefty
( al pacino
)
, a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of bieng a
" wiseguy
"
. regrettably
, pistone learns his lessons all too well
. his concern for lefty
, who is burdened with a heroin addicted son
, exacerbates his own family troubles
: his children resent his lengthy absences
and his wife fears that her husb
and
' s gangster persona isnt becoming a little too convincing
. true
, the focus on pistone
' s family life does deviate from the typical ganster
- flick formula
,
but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins
. the unhappy couple trade predictable lines
and engage in drawn
- out domestic squabbles
? including an ill
- advised marriage guidance routine
? that slow the film down unnecessarily
. the biggest problem with donnie brasco
,
however
, isnt that its wiseguy attitude
and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors
. the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70
' s
,
but not with the consistent
and blindingly tacky style
? i loved those fluoro coloured suits
? of scorces
' costume drama casino
. moreso importantly
, pacino
' s presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively
. donnie brasco
' s take on american values
, for instance
, is feeble
and obvious
. lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment tothe the accompaniment of grating inspirational music
. inexplicably
, lefty
' s horatio alger inspired gush is suppoed to move us
. it doesn
' t any more than his family troubles do
, which are dealt in thge same saccharine
and obvious manner as pistone
' s
. just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies
and scarface
. in these pictures pacino
' s dedication to a peculiar
and bloody hyper
- capitalism was twisted
and confronting
, while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends
and family was intriguingly dark
? neither were spred bloody retri
bution for breaching wiseguy regulations
. donnie brasco
' s tawdry little crime
, therefore isn
' t so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes
,
but the shameless way in which it sanitises them
.
( oh annd by the way
, i forgot to mention that tghe script also sports a startling subplot
: pipstone
' s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination
? is that a
" damn you mcbain
!
" i hear from springfield way
?
) so the movei is cliched
. big deel
, what dont you expect from a gangster
- flick
? well you expect quality action sequences
and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre
. donnie brasco fails on both counts
. the acation scenes never rise above the ordinary
and depp
' s woeful performance tends to smother the good
- work of his comrades
. admittedly
, pacino does nothing new
and michael madsen
( sonny
) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr
. white
,
but both possess an unmistakable sly charm
. depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself
,
but regrettably
, being infact the presence of one ofthe his betters must have left him star
- struck
, for he is completly hell
- bent onthe mimicking pacino
' s well
- earned high style
. the consequences are painful to watch
. its no exaggeration to say that the film
' s credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family
' s uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner
' s phony brooklyn accent
. perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco
. maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy dem
anded tiered dialogue
and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks
. if this is indeed the case
, surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored teh fascinating possibility that amercia
' s underworld is committed to emulating
, albeit in heavily attenuated form
, thier movie namesakes
. depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big
- screen gangster greats
. who knows what insights into the criminal psyche sould have arisen
?
but thne again
, perhaps donnie brasco isn
' t so true aftter all
.
