writing a screenplay forthe a thriller is hard
. harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun
. harder than buidling a bridge over troubled waters
.
and incidentally
, a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review
. thrillers are all variations on a theme
. ytou have a smart
, resourceful
,
and powerful bad guy
, who has a goal he has tothe meet
. yuo have a noble
and brave good guy
, who has to protect the innocent
, kill the bad guy
,
and not get killed himself in hte process
. the trick of thriller writing is doing all of thsi in an interesting
and novel manner
. this simple formula cxan lead to clasic movies like north by northwest
, high noon
, or silence of the lambs
, or big summer blockbusters like men in balck
, the fugitive
, or air force one
, or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds
, event horizon
, kull the conqueror
.
.
.
. is anyone else getting depressed here
? point is
, it
' s not enough to follow the forumla
. you
' ve got to throw in something extra
, something good
and new
and better than the last version
. something to surprise
and move all of us people who buy the tickets
and the popcorn annd the hapyp meals
. this is a hard thing to do
,
but it is absolutely necessary in eveyr way
. without that something extra
-
- whther it
' s a great plot or a well
- written screenplay
, or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or graet big hungry dinosaurs
-
- the movie fails
. that
' s why the jackal
, with all its starpower
, with all its budget
, with all its hype
, gets a big fat f
. bruce willis isnt the bad guy
, yhe jackal
, a legendary killer for hire
. richard gere is the ogod guy
, a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal
. the jackal is trying to kill someone
. gere is trying to stpo him
. will gere be able to stop the assassination in time
and kill the jackal
?
( i
' ll give you three guesses
,
and the first two don
' t count
.
) there are noone surprises awaiting the audience in the jackal
, no moment when you sday to yourself
,
" i wonder what happens next
?
" the script for the jackal isn
' t ripped straight from today
' s headlines
. it
' s ripped off
, straight from an episode of mllennium
. throughout the movie
, we learn what the jackal
' s plans are
and how he intends to accomplish them
. no surprise
. the funn of a movie like this should come from richard gere figuring out what the jackal
' s plan is
and developing a clever plan to foil hte bad guy
. instead
, we get twpo
( count
' em
, two
) scenes where gere is sitting in an fbi conference room somewhere
and instantly divines the jackal
' s plan just as if he
' s frank black
( or more likely
, just as if he
' s been h
anded a copy of the script
)
.
and we never git more than a superficial clue as tothe why gere has had this flash of insight
. it
' s liuke gere
' s character is psychic
,
but neither he nor yhe fbi
( or the screenwriters
) seem to know it
. adn jstu like inwhich mllennium
, the bad guy has an overwheliming need to go after the people the good guy cares about
, whether or not they are important to what he
' s trying to do or not
. what
' s more
, in the last half of the movie
, the jackal
, supposably a super
- smart professional terrorist who never makes a mistake
, comes down with a major case of the stupids
. as forthe the performances
.
.
. bruce willis manages to get through the hwole movie without a wisecrack
, which is a major achievement
,
but nto anough reason to see the movei
. his disguises are good
, bu not as good or as interesting as val kilmer
' s inspite thge saint
. richard gere is made to talk the entire movie in an irish accent
, which detracts from his otherwise lifeless
and dull performance
. sidney poitier is probably the most disappointing element in a overwhelmingly disappointing movie
-
- not that his performance is bad or anything
, it
' s not
,
but it is sad that hollywood won
' t use htis talented actor in any part other than an fbi agent
( shoot to kill
, sneakers
)
. wirting a ogod plot
and a good screenplay
, like i said
, is hard
,
but it can be done
. it wasn
' t done here
. it is our job as consumers tothe reward good screenplays
and to denounce bad
and uninteresting ones
. do not go see this movie
. you
' ll only encourage the producers to make more just like it
. instead
, stay home
and rent day of the jackal
, or in the line of fire
, or a fire safety video
, for crying out loud
. anything other tahn the jackal
, which lives up to its name by gnawing the dead bones ofthe other
, better movies
.
