- review note
: seeing as the only concern of body shots is
" sex
"
, i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review
. because of this
, i will try to vary word descriptions of
" sex
"
( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms
,
and
\ or your name is jerry falwell
, ytou are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner ofthe your screen
)
, so if there happens to be a word you come across
and cannot comprehend
, fret not
, it
' s most likely just another way of referring to
" sex
"
. i think we
' d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you apprieciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review
.
though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what
. body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously
, in the way you
' d normally expect to see a violent attack
. it
' s baout people who think about screwing
, seek it out
,
and talk about it
. theese are things we all do
, sometimes
. teh characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts
. their lives center around the next sexual encounter
,
but they seemed depressed
. it
' s as if fucking is all htey hve to look forward to after a busy workweek
. at its core body shots is a message movie
, the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition
. michael cristoffer
( who directed gia
, another film thgat treated bumping uglies as if it where evil
) is a moralist withthe nothing new to sday
. his characters don
' t communicate anything of interest to each other
, so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner
thoughts by speaking directly into the camera
. they voice simplistic platitudes like
" i like to come
" or
" sex without love equals violentce
"
. huh
?
and yes that isnt as complex as this movei
' s observations get
. the characters are stupid
and shallow
, with not one registering as anytying more
. the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure
, thne the after math
( the morning after
) of such events
. we meet the characters as they speak directly to us
, confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy
. i would normally go inot the characters
and the actors who play them
, giving you the pros
and cons
,
but for this film i cannot
. i
' m not trying to be clever or witty
,
but i honestly hardly rember anything that would set them apart from teh others
. with the exception of trent
( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman
)
, the rest fade into each other
-
- a patchwork of fake breasts
, defined abs
, pearly white teeth
,
and creamy
, flawless skin
. i vaguely reacll brad rowe as the sensitive oen
, only because his character gets the worst lines
(
" sex without love equals violence
"
)
. in between all the confessionals
, cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial
, with blurry slo mos
and dramatic head turning
. the fatc that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me
. this film is made wihtout one iota of intelligence or insight inot the generation that its tag line claims to be defining
. if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic
and f
*
* k
- obsessed
, fine
, i don
' t have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to thikn a certain way
,
but cristoffer only gives us one side
. additionally that one side isn
' t even entertaining
; the characters indulge in buggery wihtout an ounce ofthe sexiness
. or realism
. one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters
. they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other forthe no apaprent reason
( other than that they both happen to be st
anding next to each other
?
?
? alas
, if it could only be that easy
?
?
? kidding of course
)
,
then
, nto only isn
' t it erotic
, it isn
' t real
. it doesn
' t fiel like an au
thentic sexual encounter
. every f
*
* k scene in tihs film
(
and there are many
) is treated in the same unsexy manner
. body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film
. it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along iwth it
,
and most of all
, it fails to show us why its characters love mkaing it so much if they seem to hate tje ect of actually doing it
. the resulting search for nookie
(
and you can take that cookie
?
?
?
) over one night leaves us with several tedeous plot lines to follow
. the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred
. the film shows us two separtae versions of the possible rape
( one where it is consensual the other where it is not
)
and in both versions yhe young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off
. this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently
,
and if memory serves me i can
' t think of one film thgat has done so
,
and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80
' s next to wall street
. unforetunately nobody gives us reason to care
, not the writer
, the director or the actors nearly all ofthe whom seem to have w
andered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off
. paul thomas
anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar tothe what cristoffer does here
,
though boogie nights succeeded
. it was similarly moralistic
, bu it gave us two different viewpoints
; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters
,
and it showed us the possible fall
- out of such a decision
. the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here
,
but
anderson seemed to care about them
. he gavey them heart
. cristoffer gives them nothing
but raging hormones
. he preaches to us
, by using his characters to preach to us
. tihs is not the way to get any message across
. why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin
' skins
? cristofer kind of does that
,
though without an ounce ofthe insight
,
and with a helping ofthe leering exploitation
.
