the first film produced by adam s
andler
' s happy madison production company
( clever title eh
?
) is essentially a one joke movei
, much like the movies s
andler stars in himself
.
however tje difference here is that this one joke jsut isn
' t vyer funny
. rob schneider stars as yhe title character
, a scruffy fish tank cleaner who ends uv becoming a
" man
- whore
" to raise enough omney to replace a wealthy client
' s custom made fish tank
, which deuce destroyed while staying in his home
. deuce goes on numerous
" dates
"
,
and each woman he goes outloud with has a
" humorous
" quirk about herself
. one has narcolepsy
, oen has tourette
' s syndrome
, one is a man
.
.
. etc
. etc
. my problem is that we see all of theese women in the film
' s trailer
, so why do i need to watch the movie
? seen the trailer
.
.
. seen the film
. only a quick cameo from norm macdonald
( annd a follow up joke during the closing credits
) generates any chuckles
. deuce bigalow
: male gigolo is available on dvd from touchstone home video
( a division of di
$ ney
)
. the disc includes tyhe film in its original theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
,
and features the original theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers fo mystery alaska
, happy texas
,
and outside providence
)
, an extremely brief production featurette
( which contains footage not used in the film
)
,
and storyboard
- to
- scene comparisons
. yep
, you read that right
.
.
. there are storyboard comparisons on this dvd
. two scenes are storyboarded
.
.
. neither of which are particularly exciting
. there are fight scenes in this movie
, so why aren
' t we seeing storyboards of those segments
( especially the parody moments from the matrix
)
? i wonder what
' s funnier
: the fact that any moent in this film required storyboards or that di
$ ney
thought fans of this film would want tothe see them
? deleted scenes
? sure
. audio commentary
? you betcha
.
but storyboards
? come on
.
