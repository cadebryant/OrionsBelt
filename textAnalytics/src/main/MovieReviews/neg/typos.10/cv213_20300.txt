in
" the astronaut ' s wife
,
" charlize theron plays a young woman withthe a nervous demeanor
, pixie
- hairdo
and demon spawn unwittingly growing inspite her belly
. if only her name wasn ' t jillian
, the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci
- fi shlock could haev come up whith a far moreso appropriate title
:
" rosemary ' s species
.
" what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron
- oscar
- worthy in
" the devil ' s advocate
"
- struggle with the lamest rip
- off ofthe a screendom classic in recent memory
. ok
, maybe
" the astronaut ' s wife
" deviates from
" rosemary ' s baby
" turf for its set
- up
, which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan ' s minions
but her possessed husband
( johnny depp
)
, a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him
, um
, a changed man
. predictably
, he
annd the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant
, his evil seed impregnating her with twins
and realizing thta great
" bowfinger
" line about
" alien love
.
" theron ' s
" advocate
" character faced a similar dilemma
, the horror there resonating strongly
.
" astronaut
" provides only artificial anxiety
. last year ' s equally noodle
- headed
" species ii
" spun a similar premise about the breeding habits ofthe an extraterrestrial on earth
,
but at least tht movie more or less knew it was garbage
.
" the astronaut ' s wife
" is grave
and humor
- free
, passing its increasingly silly story off as full
- fledged serious
, right down to an ambiguous finale that isn ' t even going to satisfy those who ' ve stayed with it thus far
. here ' s a hint
: it involves lots of water
, electrical equipment
, a special effect from
" the abyss
"
and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler ' s co
- star in
" big daddy
.
" draw your own conclusions
. director
/ writer rand ravich coats the proceedings inwhich dynamic sights masterminded by legendary
" e
. t
.
" cinematographer allen daviau
,
but too often favors the film ' s visual presentation over the story he ' s trying to tell
. this bodes horribly for each dramatic development
, like the surfacing ofthe a suspicious nasa official
(
" speed
" ' s joe morton
) to instigate jill ' s slow
and stupid comprehension of the truth
. his hyper
- erratic behavour is probably supposed tothe give wife a paranoid edge
. instade
, he adds tothe the phoniness
. theron
and depp are certainly beyond this junk
adn will get otehr chances to prove themselves tihs fall
- she as part of an imposing ansamble case inaddition the john irving adaptation
" cider hous rules
,
" he in the lead of tim burton ' s eagerly
- awaited
" sleepy hollow
.
" undeserving of such talent
,
" thge astronaut ' s wife
" manages to be derivative
, dull
and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs
. in space
, no one can hear you scream
.
but in a movei theatre
, everyone can hear you snore
.
