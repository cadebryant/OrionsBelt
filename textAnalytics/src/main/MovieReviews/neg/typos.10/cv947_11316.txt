what were they thinking
? nestolgia for the seventies is bad enough
,
but do we really need an eighties film
? robbie hart
( adam s
andler
) used to want to be a rock
and roll star
,
but iin 1985 he
' s singing at weddings
and having a good time
. a romantic at heart
, he loves weddings
and is just about to get married to his high
- school sweetie
. when she leaves him waiting at the altar
, his tune changes to
" love stinks
"
. he meets waitress julia
( drew barrymore
) who is engaged to a junk
- bonds salesman anbd you know that they are going to get together
. in fact you know everything that is going to happen durring this movei
. s
andler is somewhat adequate in his leading man role
,
but there is no spark
. barrymore doesn
' t seem tothe be able to convey anything other tahn a pretty face with nothing behind it
: beauty
but noone attitude
. both cahracters are just there
. bit parts by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz steal the show
. the eighties are shoved in our face
. references to deloreans
, madonna
,
" dallas
"
, ivana
and donald
, burt
and loni
and
" miami vice
" get old fast
. the filmmakers must hvae realized tht there wasn
' t much entertainment to the story
and
thought they could dazzle the audience with humorous period allusions
. they
' re not funny
and it doesn
' t work
. with change on all fronts accelerating more
and omre
, nostalgia appears to have a great appeal
,
but don
' t you think we could have more than 14 years befor we yearn for the past
. maybe we cant look forward to a film next year waxing nostalgically baout el nino
.

and he knows that nostalgia is not what it used to be
