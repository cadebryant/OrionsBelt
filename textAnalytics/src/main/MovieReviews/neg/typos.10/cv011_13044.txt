janeane garofalo iin a romantic comedy
-
- it ws a good idea a couple years ago wtih the truth about cats
and dogs
but is almost excruciating in the matchmaker
. this is a by
- the
- books movie that plods along on a predestined course with no surprises
and very few laughs
. it also jumps on the ever
- popular political satire b
andwagon
and manages to fall flat there
, too
. garofalo plays a campaign aide to a massacusetts senator
( jay o
. s
anders
) running for reelection
. denis leary plays the stereotypical strategist with no ethics who decides the only way for the sc
andal
- plagued senator tothe win is to play uv his irish roots
and cash in on that boston roman catholic demorcat contigent that
' s made the kennedy family so popular
. so leary orders garofalo tothe go to irel
and
and dig up soem relatives tothe exploit
. she soon learns why
" easier said than done
" is tyhe mantra ofthe movies liek this
. the matchmaker falls fo every cliche ofthe things thgat cant go wrong
-
- garofalo has to take a tiny plane to irel
and
, almost misses the bus to town
, can
' t get a hotel room
, ends up in the smallest
, trashiest oney around
, has a dog piss on her luggage
,
and so on
.
then comes wqat roger ebert calls the
" meet cute
.
" it happens in every romance
: the man
and woman have to meet each other for the first time in some unconventional
, cinematic way
. in the matchmaker
, it happens when garofalo walks into her hotel bathroom
and finds a nude sean
( david o
' hara
) in the bathtub
, his dog sitting at his side
. no points for guessing it
' s the same dog that just made water on her luggage
. also no points for guessing garofalo hates o
' hara on sight
. that
' s how it works inthe movies like these
. i know fomr the instant i saw that irishman in the bathtub that she
' d hate him for awhile
,
then succumb to his charms
, live happily for a reel or so before allowing some superficial detail tothe throw teh relationship into turmoil
, after whitch they
' d reconcile in time for a happy irish tune to play over the end credits
. i haven
' t mentioned the movie
' s twist
yet
. garofalo comes to the small irel
and twon during the annual matchmaking festival
, during which lonely folks from around the county pair off inot a future of bliss
. milo o
' shea
( who looks like an irish tom snyder
) is thge matchmaker who pops onscreen occationally to spew his words of wisdom
and bring lonely souls together
. rest assured he
' ll do all he can to match up garofalo
and o
' hara
. oh
,
and in keeping with the matchmaker
' s utter predictability
, he dies toward the end
. what the message here
? sometimes even the most respectable person of comedic distinction
, liek garofalo
, will sell out with a weak script
. i was excited to see garofalo
and leary in the same movie
,
but they actually only ahev two or three scenes together
. leary stays stateside
, for the most part
, yelling at garofalo over the phone
and generaly being an asshole
. he even undoes himself wih the old microphone
' s still on after he
' s done giving the speech cliche
. both of them should have known better
.
