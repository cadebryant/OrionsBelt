all right
, all right
, we get the point
: despite all similarities to the best
- selling story
, speechless is
* not
* based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville
and mary matalin
. in fact
, the script was in develepment well before 1992
. still
, the comparisons are inevitable
, until one realizes a critical difference
. no
, it
' s not that the speechless twosome are speech writers
, not campaign managers
; it
' s that carville
and matalin
' s story is actually interesting
. speechless is a limp
, poorly structured would
- be romantic comedy
. speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign
, where kevin vallick
( michael keaton
)
and julia mann
( geena davis
) meet
and get romantic one nigt when neither one can sleep
. what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign
: kevin is a sit
- com writer brought in to punch up the republican c
andidate
' s speeches
, while julia is the chief speech writer forthe the democratic c
andidate
. at first each one believes thgat the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship
,
but eventually they let down their guard
and become closer
.
but there are plent ofthe obstacles in the way
, including julia
' s stud
- reporter fiance
( christopher reeve
) anbd a series of stunts which continue to prove that all
' s fair in love
and politics
. the st
andard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists
and realizing only at the end that they
' re crazy about each other
. screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin
and julia into each other
' s arms in the first fifteen minutes
,
then developing the antagonism
. it
' s a noble attempt to shake things uv
, bu unfortunately it just doesn
' t wokr
. part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing thge chemistry even before the characters do
,
but in speechless they already know they
' re attracted to each other
,
and we
' re left iwth waiting for the campaign to end so they
' ll admit that they love each other already
. there is such a herky
- jerky feel tothe the constant bickering
and making up that even king
' s sharp dialogue can
' t prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour
. inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis
and michael keaton
,
and wtih those performances most of their scenes together
. the problems begin wtih their initial courtship
, which does virtually nothing to establish julia
' s character annd mearly establishes that kevin is a wise
- ass
. davis is radiantly beautiful
,
and keaton is generally entertaining
,
but these characters are so plastic that nothing taht happens to them seems to marter one bit
. in a couple of scenes
, like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain
, they actually achieve some measure of connection
. for the most part
,
however
, they
' re just actors spouting lines
. you keep waiting for a little spark
,
and it never happens
. perhaps most disappointing is that king
and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless
' s politics
. the setting seems perfect for a high
- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix
,
but that
' s never the tone that underwood is going for
. he wants a warm
, fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman
' s flute
-
and
- wind muscial score
,
and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin
and julia fades into tyhe background
. it might as well have been a story about rival grocers
,
and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possably be
. i was about the only reviewer in thge civilized world who seemed tothe enjoy robert king
' s previous screenplay
, the dana carvey flop clean slate
, so i had some hopes for speechless
.
but hwile there is wit in the words
, this is a script which was probably much better on papper
. on screen
, it
' s still paper thin
.
