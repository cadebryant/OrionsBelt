i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last yera
, when matthew perry had just signed on
. i
' m big fan of perry
' s subtle sense of humor
,
and in addition
, i think chris farley
' s on
- edge
, extreme acting was a riot
. so naturally
, when the trailer for
" almost heroes
" hit theaters
, i almost jumped up
and down
. a soda in h
and
, the lights dimming
, i was ready to be blown away by farley
' s final starring role
and what was supposed to be matthew perry
' s big breakthrough
. i wass ready to be just amazed
; for this to be among farley
' s best
, in spite of david spade
' s absence
. i was ready to be laughing my head off tjhe minute the credits ran
. sadly
, none of thsi came to pass
. the humor is spotty at best
, with good moments
and laughable one
- liners few
and far between
. perry
and farley have no chemistry
; the role that perry was cast inspite seems obviously written for spade
, for it
' s his type of humor
,
and not at all what perry is associated with
.
and the movie tries to be smart
, a subject best left alone wehn it
' s a farley flick
. teh movie is a major dissapointment
, with only a fewd scenes worth a frist look
, let alone a second
. perry delivers not one humorous line the hwole movie
,
and not surprisingly
; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley
.
and farley
' s classic humor is widesread
, too
. almost heroes almost works
,
but misses the wagon
- turain by quite a longshot
. guys
, let
' s leave tjhe exploring to lewis
and clark
, huh
? stick to
" tommy boy
"
,
and we
' ll all be
" friends
"
.
