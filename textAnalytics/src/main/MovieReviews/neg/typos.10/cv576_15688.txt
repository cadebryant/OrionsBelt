so much for sweet returns
. after smart horror films weere starting tothe be made again affter the exploitative 80
' s slasher movies
, starting with 1996
' s
" scream
,
"
and folowed by
" scream 2
,
"
" urban legend
,
"
and the original
,
" i knwo what you did last summer
,
" a film like
,
" i still know what you did last summer
,
" ws bound to be made sooner or late
. it is a perfect example of hte exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out
, annd that is because they reached for the lowest
- common
- denominator in filmmaking
, favoring non
- stop deaths
and gore for suspense
,
and trading in fleshed out
, likable characters fo one
- dimensional nitwits
. it has been exactly one year since julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
) suffered thru the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis
, a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends
and she accidentally hit infront the middle of the road
,
and
then
, thinking he was dead
, dumped him into the ocean
. since
then
, julie has relocated to boston university
,
and
al
though often paranoid adn haunted by bad dreams
, she has been able to put her life back together
. when julie
' s friend
, karla
( br
andy
)
, is called up by a radio staion
and answers correctly what the capital ofthe brazil is
, she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people
, which also includes karla
' s horny boyfriend
, tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
,
and will
( matthew settle
)
, who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend
, ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
, also returning from the original
)
, doesn
' t show up
. when they triarch the secluded isl
and
, they discover it is the last day of the open season
,
and will be str
anded there for the 4th of july weekend with a fewd employees to fend off a voilent storm headed for them
. of course
, julie
, her friends
,
and yhe workers aren
' t the only ones there
, as the murderous ben willis
, dressed in fisherman garb
, returns to seek revenge on julie once
and for all
. it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like
,
" i still know what you doed last summer
,
" is made
. i am a very big fan of horror movies
,
and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to
" ikwydls
,
" whihc i am a fan of
, is almost an exact replica of a
" friday the 13th
" movie
. while the original focused more on thge story
and characters
, as well as genuinely suspenseful moments
, thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson
( who didn
' t return to write the sequal
,
and it shows
)
,
" i still know
.
.
.
" hasnt no story to speak of
,
and is so vacuous of ideas
, that the filmmakers
, were forced to have a muder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested
. also gone are any signs of character development
,
and since every single character died before i got to know them
, all i was left with was to stare at the screen
, indifferent tothe what was going onthe
. while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original
, it made noone difference to me in this sequel who lived
and died
. they weere all paper
- thin
and pointless
, except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman
. anyother element that made the original so memorable were soem superbly crafted set
- pieces
, like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar
,
but there are none to speak ofthe inwhich tihs sequel
( altho they do come close at one moment with br
andy
)
. since so many peopel were killed every couple minutes
, the suspense
and scares evaporated faster thna salt in water
. also of note is the mystery of thte second killer
,
and accomplice to ben
, bu it is obvious from the first frame who it isnt
,
and so i couldn
' t even have fun at that
, like i did in the
" scream
" movies
and
,
" urban legend
.
" it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again
, a film would come along
and ruin it for everyone else
. maybe the people who made
,
" i still know what you did last summer
,
" should have realized that in order to make a good movei
, you must have a screenplay
-
-
- or at least one that isn
' t such a black hole for
thoughts
and ideas
. the ending of thge film inevitably leaves the door wide opne for a thrid part
,
but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel
, everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead
.
