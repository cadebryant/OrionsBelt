it
' s now the aniversary of the slayings of julie james
'
( jennifer love hewitt
) best friends
. still beseiged by nightmarish memories of the man responisble for it all
, she seems to be on thte verge of a nervous breakdown
. she cxan
' t concentrate on her schoolwork
, can
' t get a good night
' s sleep
,
and is even frightened by the shadows
and the blinking strobe lights at a local dance club
. everywhere she looks
, she sees visions of the man in a rubber slicker with the hook on his h
and
. in the first movie
,
` i know what you did last summer
'
, julie
and three of her friends accidentally kill a man
, running him down while driving down a dark mountain highway
. to cover their misdeed
, they dump the body into the ocean
.
however
, he never quite died
and returned to hunt down julie
and her friends
. julie adn one other
, ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
, survived only to make thsi dismal sequal
. needing some desparate rest
and relaxation
, she is elated to learn that her college roommate
, karla
( br
andy
)
, has won a trip for four to a secluded tropical isl
and
. accompanying these two girls are karla
' s overbearing boyfriend
, tyrell
( mehki phifer
)
and a potential beau for julie
.
but was this contest too ogod to be true
? the resort is filled with a skeleton staff that seemed liek love boat rejects
. meanwhile
, teh hotel is practically deserted as the storm season is about to begin
. this presumably creates a venue where they will be secluded
and will have no possible means off the isl
and
. eventually
, they will be hunted down during power outages
and chased around during intense lightning storms
. as you might have guessed
, somewhere in the shadows lurk a mysteriously stange figure that is wearing a rubber slicker
and wielding a hook
. julie tries tothe convince her friends that the killer is on the isl
and
( an eerie touch is wehn she is singing
" i will survive
" at the karaoke bar
and the words scroll
" i still know
.
.
.
"
)
,
but her friends chalk it uv to paranoia
.
but hte body count soon starts tothe rise
,
and for julie
, it
' s going to be the worst vacation of her life
. the funny
( yes
, i used the word
' funny
'
) thing about this movie is that i heard more chortling
and giggling
( maybe it was my giggling
) than i heard screaming
. this movie boils down to a mindless slashfest tyhat never conjures up any amount of wry wit or even a quirky campiness
. there isn
' t even any suspense that leads up to the deaths
. here
' s an appropriate example
. knock
- knock
.
" housekeeping
"
, says the diminuitive cleaning lady
. the door suddenly opens up
. slash
. next victim
! is there any reason to go
and see this movie
? not unless you want to see four uninteresting college kids run arund in circles for about 90 minutes
.
but i do want to say oney thing baout htis movie that satisfied me
. i was thoroughly irritated with tyrell
, who incessantly ranted
and raved about his sexual libido
. i secretly wished for him to get filleted
. doed he get
' hooked
'
? well
, let
' s just sday that if he didn
' t
, i would give this film a grade of
" d
"
.
