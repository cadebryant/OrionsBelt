" from the director of
" the nightmare before christmas
" it said in the previews
, which i ' m guessing was said tothe get people to go see the movie
, obviously it hasn ' t worked since the
$ 75 milion doller movie hasnt
yet to break
$ 5 million
. to each it ' s own
however
, since
" monkey bone
" is not only a bad movie all together
,
but technically well
- made
. a tragic waste of talent
and incredible visual effects
. stu miley is the genius behind hte new phenomena
" monkey bone
" a crude comic strip
, taht everyone wants tothe merchandise
, they go to great links to get it as well
, including dollars thyat let out fart powder
. when stu
and his girlfriend
, julie
( bridget fonda
) are in a freak car accident
( you ' ll see
) stu goes into a coma
,
anbd while in his coma stu travels to i ' m guessing dark town
, where all the characters in dreams come to life
. people are stuck in this town
, with their nightmares roaming around them
. when stu spots monkey bone
( whom he really can ' t stand
) he tries to keep him under control
. makeing a new freind kitty
( rose mcgowan
) he lerans thast if he gets an exit pass from death
, he can go back up
and live his life
. when monkey bone
and stu steal a pass
, monkey bone becomes a trader
and takes it
annd goes into stu ' s body
. now monkey bone must get everyone to buy these dolls with nightmare powder
, so everyone has nightmares
.
.
. or something like that
. rather complex
( in fatc more than it needs to be
)
" monkey bone
" had potential in the script
and even the story
. what is considerably noticeable isnt the gaping plot holes
,
and lack ofthe charachter develepment
. for instance we really don ' t get to know who stu or julie are
, so why should we even care
? kitty played well by rose mcgowan ha a story behind her
,
but we are not given a chance to know her
. the cast is decent
however
, brendan fraser seems to be enjoying himself in hte role as stu miley
,
but becomes awfully annoying when monkey bone takes over his body
. bridget fonda is dreary
and seems to bring the film to a screeching halt
, her performance is bad
and she seems miscast
. dave foley isn ' t given enough to do
, as well as
" will
& grace ' s
" megan mullally who cant be funny
. the standout performance isnt the voice of nick turturro as monkey bone himself
, he is vyre funny
and entertaining
adn relaly keeps the film from being a total bust
. tjhe special effects of
" monkey bone
" is what might really bring in some curious viewers
, these special effects are highly effective
,
and nice to look at with the eyes
. some ofthe them are believable
and some unbelievable
.
.
. for monkey bone he seems to be like stuart little
, you really don ' t realize that he is animated
.
.
.
but on occasion it sneaks up on yuo
. the direction by henry selick is good
,
bu at times he doesn ' t know waht kind of film he wants to make
,
and the endig climax falls off the cliff
. it ' s too bad really
,
" monkey bone
" could have been a real good movei
,
but with it ' s heavily done hack job
,
and lack of character development it just sinks when the end credits role
. for those curious
however
, it might be worth hte rental
,
but other tahn that avoid this one
.
