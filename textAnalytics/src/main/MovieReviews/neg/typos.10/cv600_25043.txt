silly performances anbd some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people str
anded at
" the last stop cafe annd motel
" due to heavy snowfall
. one of tjhe str
anded is a colorado state highway patrolman
( adam beach
) who discovers a muder scene
and a bag full of cash from a recent bank robbery
. someone amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber
and a murderer
,
but is it the smae person or are there multiple criminals
? adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film
. he doesn
' t play the role wih enought seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny
. his performance is stuck somewhere in the middle
, annd this film really needed it to be on one side or the otehr
. rose mcgowan is cold
and unpleasant to the eye as always
,
and jurgen prochnow
.
.
. what on earth is he doing in this
? best performance comes from william s
. taylor as a cheesy
(
yet still somehow cool
and confident
) wayne newton drifter type
. the last stop is available on dvd fomr sterling home entertainment
. as usual with sterling
, they
' ve filled out this dvd with extra features
. the disc contains thge film in its original aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
, a choise of 2
. 0 dolby suround sound or 5
. 1 dolby digital surround sound
, a full length audio commentary track whith director mark malone
, interviews with yhe cast anbd crew
, the original trailer
,
and the usual casted
and crew biographies
. thte film itself might not be the greatest
,
but sterling
' s effort of adding decent extra features while keeping hte price affordable
( suggested retail of
$ 19
. 95
) makes this dvd worth the money
.
