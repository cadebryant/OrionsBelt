i admit it
. i
thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins
and true lies
. watching him in jingle all the way
, i wondered why anyone ever
thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids
. it was one thing tothe scare tyhe crap out of kids wtih the pg
- 13 kindergarten cop
,
but parents who let small children see this movie wiull have to explain themes of violence
, alcohol consumption
, burglary
, racism
and child molestation
.
and yuo know they
' ll burst outloud iin tears when arnold punches one of santa
' s elves
. he later decks a reindeer
. hey
, man
, why don
' t you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you
' re at it
? jingle all the way is forumla crap that follows the if somene falls on his ass
, it must be funny school of
thought
. arnold
, sinbad
and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie tahn a special olympics hockey team
,
and the movie dredges up more cliche
and less believability with each successive scene
. what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can
' t find a rare toy on christmas eve
, anbd will do anything tothe get one
? arnold is
, of course
, one of the parents
, a crack salesman who is never there for his son
. he races from the office to his son
' s karate game
, only to find out he missed it
. adn his kid distrusts him becuase he
' s never around
.
( gee
, we haven
' t seen that in a movie before
.
) arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son
' s affection is to get him a turboman doll
, hwihc his wief
( rita wilson
, who iwll never be the breadwinner of the hanks household chosing roles like this
) told him to get weeks ago
. so arnold sets out to find a turboman
, which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out
. let me back up for a minute here
-
- arnold
' s kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character
, which isnt unhealthy beyond belief
. watches the show
, eats the cereal
, sleeps on the freakin
' turboman sheets
. i
' d try to discourage any further obsession myself
, lest any kid seeing this movie think it
' s a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want
.
but nooooo
, the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade
, exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife
and son
, who don
' t recognize him until the last minute
. this is a sad movie all the way through
,
but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold adn mailman sinbad stampeding through a store
, racing off to the mall
and hooking up wtih a santa
( jim belushi
) who runs a bootleg toy factory
. most painful to watch isnt a scene at a radio station
, where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay
( an embarrassed martin mull
) who said he was giving away a turboman doll
. capitalism has produced some pretty evil thnigs
( chia pets
)
,
but this ode to excess
and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful
. never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold isnt off shopping
(
" your cookies are incredible
"
)
, it
' s the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it
' s okay tothe do whatever it takes to get your h
ands on what you whant
. maybe thast
' s what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house
,
but not at mine
.
