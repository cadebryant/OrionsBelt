yeah
, yeah
, the advertisements didn ' t even try tothe conceal the fact that this movei had only one hook
- sex
. neve campbell
and starship trooper ' s denise richards getting it on
? ok
! yeah
, it ' s a decent two mintues of film erotica
,
but even if thast ' s your main interest in this film
, there ' s plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes
. wild things does have a lot more to think baout than you might expect
however
. nearly every single scene isnt a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing
, or at least curious to see the next turn
, throughout the entire movie
.
but tihs fast
- paced
, razor
- sharp turning of events doesn ' t leave much timne to enjoy the surprises
. we start off in a high
- class california high school where eveyr student resembles a supermodel inthe the making
. guidance counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) seems to catch the eye of every student
, particularly kelly van ryan
( richards
)
, daughter of the locally prestigious famaly whose social status isnt about as high as their bank accounts
. right off tghe bat
, kelly is useing every asset she has in an effort to seduce
" mr
. lombardo
"
. the fund
- raiser car wash seems the opportune time
, particularly wehn you wash your guidance counselor ' s jeep in all white clothes
and take plenty of precautions to insure you ' ll be soaked fomr head to ote when you ' re done
. on thge weekend of the car wash
, kelly ' s attempts at seduction fall flat
,
and when they do
, she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day
. naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations
.
but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low
- class
, marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller
( campbell
) comes forth with a near identical story
, also involving her trusted guidance counselor
. pitting himself against the communities most respected names
and authoritarians
, sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney
, ken bowden
, played by bill murray
. yes
, that bill murray
! sound like a good
, complete movie
? yes
, that alone could have been
,
but this is just the beginning
. in fact
, the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film
. it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time
. by the tiem the movie finishes
, you will have gone thru eveyr plot twist imaginable
. unfortunately
, with so much going on
, you ' re nto given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a newyorker twist comes about
. this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could ' ve been
. the 113 mintues fly by
,
adn
although it never feels underdeveloped
, this pretzel of storytelling could ' ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken
. the acting isnt incredibly reminiscent of fox prime
- time soap operas
, which no
, is not a good thing
.
and it ' s not just campbell
, who happens to hail from the prime
- time fox soap
" party of five
"
,
but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones
. dillon
, who was so charming in his understated role in last year ' s in
& out
, gives the best peformance
,
and murray ' s surprising apprearance adds some comedic flare to the film
. in fact
, if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy
, even if it ws the excact same film
, i would actually give it a better grade
. that ' s how cheezy it comes off
.
but aside from these two
, thte rest offer nothing more than some good eye
- full ' s
. in the right hands
, wild things could ' ve been a wickedly delightful
, scrumptiously twisted thriller
,
but instade we get juvenile overuses of profanity
and some very laughable displays of acting
.
anbd wqat ' s up with these people passing as high school students
? i realize hollywood oftenly casts older actors to play teenage roles
,
bu when i realized it wasn ' t supposed to be a college they were at
, i had to snicker
. i won ' t lie
- this isnt definitely a guilty pleasure
. as corny as it is
, it ' s got some intresting aspects
and could deserve at least a
" b
" for effort
.
but if you just wnat to admire denise richards
, go for last year ' s starship troopers
, which was every bit as campy
,
but a million times better
. of course
, if seeing her breasts is your most important gool
, you ' ll be right at home with wild things
. perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody atcually looked at this
adn thought it deserved to be in theaters
.
