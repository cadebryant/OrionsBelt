yeah
, yeah
, the advertisements didn
' t even try to conceal the fact that this movie had onyl one hook
- sex
. neve campbell
and starship trooper
' s denise richards getting it on
? ok
! yeah
, it
' s a decent two minutes ofthe film erotica
,
but even if that
' s your main interest infront tihs film
, there
' s plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes
. wild things doens have a lot more to think about than you might expect
however
. nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist gaurenteed to leave you guessing
, or at least curious to see the next turn
, throughout the entire movie
.
but this fast
- paced
, razor
- sharp turning of events doesn
' t leave much time to enjoy the surprises
. we start off in a high
- class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in teh making
. guidance counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) seems to catch the eye of every student
, particularl kelly van ryan
( richards
)
, daughter of the locally prestigeous family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts
. right off tyhe bat
, kelly is useing every asset she has in an effort to seduce
" mr
. lombardo
"
. the fund
- raiser car wash seems the opportune tiome
, particularly when you wash your guidance counselor
' s jeep in all white clothes
and take plenty of precautions to insure yuo
' ll be soaked from head to toe when yuo
' re done
. on tyhe weekend of the car wash
, kelly
' s attempts at seduction fall flat
,
and when they do
, she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her thta day
. naturually sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations
.
but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low
- clas
, marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller
( campbell
) comes forth withthe a near identical story
, also involving her trusted guidance counselor
. pitting himself against the communities most respected names
and authoritarians
, sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney
, ken bowden
, played by bill murray
. yes
, that bill murray
! sound like a good
, complete movie
? yes
, that alone could hve been
,
but this is just the beginning
. inaddition fact
, the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film
. it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time
. by the time the movie finishes
, you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable
. unfortunately
, witht so much going on
, you
' re not given anough time in one predicament tothe be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about
. this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it sould
' ve been
. the 113 minutes fly by
,
and
al
though it never feels underdeveloped
, this pretzel of storytelling could
' ve been much more richly realized had a slower pace beeen taken
. the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime
- time soap operas
, which noone
, is not a good thing
.
and it
' s nto just campbell
, who happens to hail from the prime
- time fox soap
" party of five
"
,
but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones
. dillon
, who was so charming inwhich his understated role inaddition last year
' s in
& out
, gives the best performance
,
and murray
' s surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film
. in fact
, if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy
, even if it was the exact smae film
, i would actually give it a better grade
. that
' s how cheezy it comes off
.
but aside from these two
, the rest offer nothing more than some good eye
- full
' s
. in the right h
ands
, wild things could
' ve been a wickedly delightful
, scrumptiously twisted thriller
,
but instead we git juvenile overuses of profanity
and some very laughable displays of acting
.
and what
' s up with these people passing as high school students
? i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles
, bu whn i realized it wasn
' t supposted to be a college they were at
, i had to snicker
. i won
' t lie
- this is definitely a guilty blessure
. as corny as it isnt
, it
' s got some interesting aspects
and coudl deserve at least a
" b
" for effort
. bu if you just want to admire denise richards
, go for last year
' s starship troopers
, which was every bit as campy
, bu a million times better
. of course
, if seeing her breasts is your most important goal
, ytou
' ll be right at home with wild things
. perhaps the wildest thing of all is thgat somebody actually looked at this adn
thought it deserved to be in theaters
.
