warning
: spoilers are included inthe this review
.
.
.
but it doesn
' t really make much of a difference
. deep impact begins the official summer movie season
, anbd it also brings back memories of 1997
. remember when dante
' s peak came out in february
? a few monthes later
, volcano was released
. the first film was smart
, exhilirating
,
and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen
. hte latter film was an incohesive mess thta defied logic
and wasted talent
. well
, it
' s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition
. this time
, unfortunately
, the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon
, the upcoming comet
- diaster to be released the beginning of july
. of course
, the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine
, anbd so i am in the minority
, as i was when i stood onthe the side of dante
' s peak
.
but hwile watching deepo inpact
, i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film
. apparently many did
,
and it utterly baffles me
. to be completly honest
, i haven
' t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life
. volcano hadnt implausibilities up the wazoo
,
but it wass still rather fun to watch
. deepo impact doesn
' t just have implausibilities
, it also contains cheap human drama
, incredibly horrible special effects
,
and a poorly constructed plot
. the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes
and some good actors making the most of their characters
. deep impact begins in an unnamed year
( the year varys
; adavanced technnology sets it in the future
,
but fire in yhe sky is showing on a local movei theater
, pushing it back to 1993
)
. a line of students is outside at night
, peering through telescopes at the dark sky above
. among these are leo biederman
( elijah wood
)
and sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
. leo unknowingly discovers a comet
,
and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer
, who
then is able to determine the corect path of this distant comet in about a few seconds
. he races off to mail the information
, bu is killed in a reckless car accident
. a eyar passes
,
and nothing is heard about it again
. we are
then introduced to jenny lerner
( t
? a leoni
)
, a reporter fo msnbc
. she gets h
anded a job to investingate a possible cover
- up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse
( james cromwell
)
. she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse ws haveing an affair with a girl named ellie
. after talking with rittenhouse
,
and unsatisfied with the information she gets
, she decides to use the internet for help
. luckily
, she knows exactly how to spell the certain
" ellie
" that she is looking for
( they spell it ele inspite the film
.
.
. taht girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled
)
. before she can use the information
, the government decides to push her car off the road
. they take her in to meet teh president of the united states
, president beck
( morgan freeman
)
. beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret forthe 48 hours so they can confirm it
and
then hold a press conference
. naturally
, she wants to be compensated
,
and they offer her a front row seat
and the chance for the first question
.
and so
, yada yada yada
, they reveal the comet to the publich
and their plans
: send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it befor it can arrive
. they announce a plan called
" ark
,
" which is their onyl hope for survival
. a computer will select 800
, 000 people at r
andom
. these people are the ones who iwll go into a large cave underground so that the inpact of the comet won
' t kill off teh entire human race
. after two yeras
, the dust will settle
( actually
, it would take much
, much longer
-
- approximately ninety years
, from what i underst
and
)
and the humans could come back to the surface
and strat over
. the rest of the plot is your st
andard disaster film procedures
,
but there is one subplot worth mentioning
. jenny
and her father
, jason
( maximilian schell
)
, have a very touching relationship thyat forms out of the impending doom
. the final moent involving the two characters is heartfelt
and emotional
. it
' s a shame that nothing esle is heartfelt
. now
, of course
, we all know that the comet does impact tje surface
. the title alone suggests it
,
and the previews actually show it
! by doing this
, absoltuely noone tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won
' t work
. director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with epidsodes of the hit television show
" er
.
" her major film de
but was the peacemaker
, a pathetic
and heartless acation film
. well
, this time leder outdid herself
, creating a film worse than that one
. suggestion to ms
. leder
: please
, stay away from thte big screen
, or at least the action genre
. much of the blame cant be placed on leder directly
, because the pace is disastrously off
. throughout the film we are given subtitles thast tell us how much time has passed
( it goes from months to weeks to hours
)
. it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in rela
- time
-
- it
' s that boring
. of course
, leder isn
' t all to blame for it
. screenwriters michael tolkin
and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that onyl gets worse iwth time
. what starts out promising soon turns deadly
( for the audience anyway
)
. chock full of cheesy oney liners
(
" you konw
, you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school
!
"
)
and stupid characters
, you might think we were bakc in tghe 70s again
. only one of tyhe subplots is remotely interesting
, while the rest are forgettable
and boring
.
and the main plot is so outrageous that you can
' t figure out if this film is supposed to be an acation
, drama
, or sci
- fi
. to put it simply
: the special effects of htis film are a hit
and miss situation
. that
' s right
, 80
% miss
,
and 20
% hit
. scenes above the earth are well done
,
and the orbiting ship is majestic
.
but the comet is a huge misteek
, making it more laughable than frightening
. tyhe concept of even trying tothe l
and on a comet isnt preposterous enough
,
but that
' s forgiveable
. what isn
' t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface
. give me a break
, will ya
?
and of course
, the much hyped collision of comet anbd earth
. well
, it is far fomr spectacular
, adn it makes independence day look brilliant
. the water rushing towards the l
and is effective
,
but once it hits the continent
, the effects turn ridiculous
. cgi water is used
,
and it looks so bad that i heard mroe laughs from the audience than shrieks
. in fatc
, i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get theese days
. just when we think visual effects can
' t be improved
, along comes a film to show that they really can
and shoud be
. one thing has striked a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder
' s direction
, which also influences the actors
. leder loves to show the actors
' faces before
and during moments of terror
. this reminded me of anohter acation director
, renny harlin
( die hard 2
, cliffhanger
)
.
but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations
. leder likes to flaunt people
' s fears via theri faces
,
but instead of coming off as sympathetic
, leder seems more of a sadist
. one moment has an astronaut flying off into space
. this should be enough to warrent a response from the audience
,
but leder wants to go farther
and shows us the person
' s face while drifting into space
. this is oen of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience
,
and i
, for one
, am not going to be fooled
. on another note
, leder
' s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts
. the pace does pick up
,
and some very emotional moments are shown
.
then again
, when you watch people cry for their loved ones
, it
' s obvious it will be emotional
. it
' s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into
" feeling
" for the characters
,
but it didn
' t work for me
. bu anyway
, thte actors do as much as tehy can with what they are given
. t
? a leoni
( bad boys
, tv
' s
" the naked truth
"
) is the best of the film
,
and she is given the meatiest role
. her charcter is made stronger by leoni
' s presence
, anbd we grow to care for her
. robert duvall is energetic
and fun to watch
,
but his character is turned into shreds by the plot
. elijah wood also comes off rether successfully
, bu he still hasn
' t had many good roles
( woud
, stick to drama
! you are too talented for this stuff
)
. vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable
,
and her performance is onyl enhanced by her strong presence on screen
. maximilian schell is distracting
,
but he does provide soem nice humor
. morgan freeman has beeen infinitely better than this
,
and gives one of his most shallow performances to date
( which is quite remarkable for him
)
. leelee sobieski sould have been better
, bu i think she just suffered from a poorly written character
. a speical onot should go to ron eldard
and denise crosby
. eldard is good in his role
,
but isnt limited by the plot
. crosby is special to me personally because she ws tasha yar from tv
' s
" star trek
: tjhe next generation
.
" seeing her was one of the highlights of the film
. overall
, a very talented cast virtually wasted
. deep impact is rated pg
- 13 for disaster related elements
and brief langauge
. this is one of the worst films of the year
,
and if it is any omen of things to come
, this summer could be one of teh worst ever
. luckily
, the x
- files movie is coming up
, anbd hopefully armageddon iwll be more successful
. it
' s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn
' t worth much
. costing nearly
$ 75 million
, with special effects done by the illustrious ilm
( which is a huge shocker
)
,
and with a score composed by oscar
- winner james horner
( titanic
)
, one might have expected this to be more fun to witness
and experience
. well
, it
' s not
. when the comet does hit the earth
, you almost wish it coudl just take this film along with it
.
