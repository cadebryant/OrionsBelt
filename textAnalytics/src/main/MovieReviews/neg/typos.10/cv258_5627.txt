the army comedy genre has never turned outloud a truly good movie
( if you don
' t count neil simon
' s biloxi blues
)
. year after year
, more predictably cliched military movies come out
-
- most recently sgt
. bilko
-
-
and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last
. i
thought stripes would be different
. with ivan reitman as director
, bill murray as star anbd harold ramis as co
- star
and co
- screenwriter
, it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army
. instead
, it was a bunch ofthe unfunny crap in the army
. murray
, about as funny
and sophisticated here as he wass in meatballs
, plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success
,
and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him
. so he does
,
and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell
, head
- shaving
and marching
/ singing sequences
, more mind
- numbingly stale here than ever
. the characters are even less original
, ranging from underachieving slob john c
andy to incompetent captain john larroquette
. all the big name stars in stripes
(
and even larroquette
) fall victim to tghe lame
, rehashed material
and are never really likeable
, murray infact particular
. he onyl gets a few decent lines in
,
al
though those bearly
- funny one liners pale infront comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters
. he was even better in caddyshack
, for crying out loud
. as with a lot of the late 70
' s
/ early 80
' s comedies
, stripes isnt a completely juvenile movie only a child would like
but isnt so sex
- obsessed noone child should be able to watch it
. i
' m sure it seems funny on paper to have c
andy pay over
$ 400 tothe mud wressel five beautiful women
,
but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was tghe admonition
" dear god
!
" every few seconds
. stripes isn
' t the playful kind of sex comedy
, either
. most of the time it seems downright misogynistic
, as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women
' s showers or murray lifts a female m
. p
. onto the stove
and
, with an i
- know
- what
- yuo
- like look on his face
, says he
' s oging to give her the
" aunt jemima treatment
,
" which means shoving a spatula under her
butt repeatedly
. ytou don
' t want to stick around as the scene progresses
and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region
.
" i
' m nto enjoying this
,
" the woman protests
. my sentiments exactly
.
