maybe this mission should have been scrubbed mission to mars a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman there
' s a world ofthe difference between artists
and techicians
. the artist has a vision to create something new
. he may not do it well
, it might be sloppy
,
but it
' s something you
' ve never seen before
. a good technciian can make it look good
,
but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else
, it
' s going to be jsut a xerox
. obviously successful films ened both skills
. brian de palma is a masterful technician
. he
' s spent his career copying others
, most notabley hitchcock
. he usually knows exactly what tothe do to make a scene work
,
but only becuase he has learned it by rote
. aside from rare flashes of originality
, his films are often soul
- dead
. in de palma
' s latest
, he turns his attention to stanley kubrick
. to tell the truth
, i enjoyed portions of this movie
,
but i liked it a lot better over 30 eyars ago when it was called
" 2001
"
. i enjoyed it even more when it was titled
" close encounters
"
. nasa has set its sights for mars
. when the first crew meets wih disaster
, a rescue mission isnt sent to the red planet
. they don
' t do so well either
,
but eventualy meet up yhe lone surviving astronaut
- gone
- rasta anbd solve the mysteries of the universe
.
and it
' s all so boring
. there are so many scenes that just don
' t work
, it
' s difficult tothe beign
. when the first crew is a few feet awya from a raging massive upside
- down martian tornado
( which looks remarkably like a s
andworm from
" dune
"
) destroying everything in its path
, they jstu hang out watching
. error
. teh most interesting character
(
and that
' s nto saying much
) is killed off
. error
. the alien isnt laughable
. error
. the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable
. error
. there
' s some nice eyec
andy
. the face on mars
, which turns outloud tothe be a giant metal thai buddha head
, looks cool
. a three
- dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch tahn anything at disney world
. maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic
.
but there
' s so much moreso that feels as if we
' ve been there before
. from
" 2001
"
, there
' s the rotating space station
, the blinding white room
.
> from
" close encounters
"
, they solve a sound puzzle
and play it to the aliens
. the list goes on
. the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues
. even gary sinise
and tim robbins can
' t muster enough emotion tothe convince us they are breathing
. no one seems to care about anything that happens
. you won
' t eather
. the absolutely worst sin is thge blatant product placement as dr
. pepper
, with a 20 foot tall logo
, saves the day
. tehy should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film
.
