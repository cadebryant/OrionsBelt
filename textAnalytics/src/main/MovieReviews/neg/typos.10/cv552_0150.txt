this review contains spoilers
,
but believe me
, i don
' t say anything you can
' t guess 10 minutes into the movie
. i
* did
* go into this noe with high expectations
. i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks
. i sort ofthe expected another exorcist or the shining
. i even put aside my general rule of nto seeing htis type of film
. boy
, was i wrong
! another garbage slasher flick
, the only difference being that
* this
* one has a story
! tje story
, you ask
? well
, a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk
. he takes it home
, somehow getting it past customs
:
-
)
and starts fiddling with it in his attic
. lo
and behold
, after he takes it apart
, three demons appear
and start taking him apart
, bu with meat hooks
. when they
' re finished
, his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling
. they botch uv their cleanup job
,
however
,
and manaze to leave his heart
( or some gl
and
; i didn
' t really recognize the organ
) under a floorboard
. the guy
' s brother
and his brother
' s wife appear at the door soon after
,
and deside to move in
. they throw awya scumball
' s belongings
,
and setted up house
. turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho
,
and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage
. she starts having some wild hallucinations
. later
, hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards
( slow
- mo spacial effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground
-
- all from the tiny cut on his h
and
)
. said blood isnt eagerly sucked up by scumball
' s organ
. the organ grows into a thign that requires
yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration inot a really ugly thing
. it establishes mind contact with wife
, who agrees to halp him get more blood
, because she really wants to be screwed again
. so
, she helps him kill three businessmen
. scumball
, at this time
, gradually gets his strength bakc
and grows all his organs back
. problem is
, he doesn
' t have any skin
,
and even after three or four corpses
, still doesn
' t get any skin
. he finally gets some
,
though
,
but strangely enough
, he ends up looking like his brother
. guess they couldn
' t get the original actor back
. who knows
. scumball
( whose name is frank
) is not a nice guy
. he descriibes his torture by the demons fondly
, as the
" ultimate pleasure
and pain
, since at that level there is no difference between the two
.
" somehow
, i don
' t see getting torn appart by 90 fish
-
and meat
- hooks a lot of fun
. tihs guy is
* so
* bad
(
" how bad
* is
* he
?
"
)
,
* so
* bad that the
* rats
* cower in a corner in fear
. for good reason
, too
; he crucifies two of them for fun
, adn carves a third while the nympho
' s horsing around with hubby
. anyway
. hubby
' s daughter
( who
, if course
, is not
* wife
' s
* daughter
) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into tjhe attic with one of her johns
and the ensuing screams
. the dumb bimbo meets scumball
,
and is not empressed
. she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle
,
and brings out the demons
. at any rate
, the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup
; they
' re normally quite meticulous about that type of thing
. the story boils down tothe the demons trying to correct their mistake
. the demons are not
,
however
, the good guys
. the dumb bimbo
' s the ogod guy
. she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank
,
but also banishes them to hell or oblivion
, we
' re not too sure whcih
. not too shabby forthe someone with single
- digit iq
. this is basically a
" bad jinn
" story
. it is an
* awful
* movie
. awful acting
, bad focuse in the photography
, many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks
, which is really unrealistic
,
and looks like the latex that it is
. continuity
? who cares
. acting
?
* terrible
*
. script
? horrible
. sounds canned
. unrealistic
. story is so
- so
,
but the impact is lost long
, long before the film ends
. i do think the
* rat
* acting was qutie good
. i have never seen rats look afraid
. they should get nominated for an award
. really good acting there
, tghe best in the movie
.
" the envelope for best furry rodent
, please
.
.
.
" a
"
" rating would be far too generous
. a
" 1
/ 10
" rating
( or
- 4 in the
- 4 to
+ 4 rating system
) is far more accurate
. this movie is so bad that peple in the audience were laughing
, chortling at the bad acting
and crummy dialouge
. i can see htis film turning into the next rocky horror picture show
. people were getting so fed uv they were yelling warnings up to the characters on the screen
. had to have something to do
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb movie
. i was embarrassed that i spent money to see it
. it goes without saying that i disagree with the other reviews on the board that attempt to review the film for itself
. lots of slime
and red
- dyed corn syrup does not constitute
" horror
,
" in my opinion
.
