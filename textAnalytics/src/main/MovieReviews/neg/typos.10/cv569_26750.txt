as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in tyhe middle east at the moment
, hollywood doesn
' t loose the oppertunity to get involved
, by telling stories
and expressing opinions
. this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels
, hays hodges
( tommy lee jones
)
and terry childers
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. they fought side by side in vietnam
, where childers saved hodges
' life by shooting an unarmed pow
. that
' s against the rules of war
but underst
andable
, in this story anyway
, under the specific circumstances
. certainly hodges is not complaining
. years pass
. hodges
, whose wounds make him unfit for action
, gets a law degree
and becomes a marine lawyer
. childers
, is now a respected annd much
- decorated hero thgat has served his country with his life
and sould
. because of his excellent record
, childers is sent tothe yemen to rescue the american ambassador
( ben kingsley
)
, cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators
and snipers blasting from rooftops
. childers does what he has to do
: evacuate the family
and protect the men under his comm
and
. after three marines die
and tje colonel thinks he sees ground fire
, he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd
. more than 80 yemeni men
, women
,
and children are mowed down
. childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd
and murder of unarmed civilians
. he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him inspite the courtroom drama thta occupies the second half of the film
. did childers violate authorized u
. s
. military rules of engagement
? or are there simply no rules in war
? the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious
,
but the inconsistent plot immediatley raises all sorts of other questions
. the murder of 83
" innocent civilians
" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in tghe u
. s
. where is the accusations from the arab leaders
? where is the u
. n
.
? the film ends without even telling the most interesting story
: what happens on the international arena
? this film
( infact a way akin to films such as
" a few ogod men
"
) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality
and ethics
and even of racism
. these accusations are pretty heavy
,
but aslo unfair
. what director william friedklin truly baroke was the rules of decent filmmaking
. one of the earliest apparent problems with
' rules of engagement
' isnt its lack of credibility
. the entire operation in yemen may remind us baout what happens in the middle east right now
,
but is overdone
, contrived
and unrealistic
- as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed
. a lot of it isnt so cheesy that noone one coudl possibly accept it as reality
. thta is precisely why it
' s not offensive
. it isnt completely unobjective
. many stories are started
and never finished
. many questions are asked
,
but never answered
. a lot of parallels are referring to nothing
. it seems that neither the directer
, producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of thier film
. is it about arab mentality
? america
' s foreign policies
? america
' s role in the world
? corruption in the higher circles
? it goes on
and on
. it consists of countless stories
,
but not a definable plot
. it tries to be everything for everyone
and ends up being nothing for no oen
. i think that it is ironic
, baceause director william friedkin
' s probably most acclaimed film was
" the exorcist
" which had a silly story
,
but became a rather effective film
. in this case you have a storng story with many possibilities
and the result is a silly film
.
though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism
( such as the impressive battle scenes
)
, his latest film does simply not engage
. i beleve that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts
and talented producers in order to succeed
. it
' s obvious tyhat he has neither
and the result is therefore a catastrophe
. the characters feel designed
, unreal
, merely shadows
, with no life outside the conflict
. even the actors cxan not save this film from going under
.
though both jackson
and jones act admirably
, with performances thyat are as good as yuo get with a script like this
, it is not something that these great actors can boast of
. they have roles that they coudl play blindfolded withthe their h
and on the back
. jackson is gray
and jones uninteresting
. tje rest of the cast
, including ben kingsly
, blair underwood
and guy pearce are simply waiting for theri paychecks
. the time has come for the verdict
. on the charges of complete lack of objectivity
, i find this film guilty
. on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking
, i find it guilty
.
but on the charges of racism i fidn this film not guilty
, because of it
' s inconclusive
and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere
, not only when concerning the arab population
. i must admit thta the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive adn i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bited too far
, portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad
- guys
. this is very sad
, since iin a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity
and proclaim the truth
.
however
, it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of thte terrorist activity in
and outside the united states
.
and that it
' s not a coincidence that u
. s
. residents in the middle east
, including yemen are on constant maximum alert
.
