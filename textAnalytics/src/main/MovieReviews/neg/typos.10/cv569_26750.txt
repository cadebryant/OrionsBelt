as we see the terrable events that unfold before our eyes iin the middle east at the moment
, hollywood doesn ' t loose the oppertunity to get involved
, by telling stories
and expressing opinions
. this film centers on a relatiopnship forged throughout the adult lifetimes ofthe two marine colonels
, hays hodges
( tommy lee jones
)
and terry childers
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. they fought side by side in vietnam
, where childers saved hodges ' life by shooting an unarmed pow
. that ' s agaisnt the rules of war
but understandable
, in htis story anyway
, under the specific circumstances
. certainly hodges is not complaining
. years pass
. hodges
, whose wounds make him unfit for action
, gets a law degree
and becomes a marine lawyer
. childers
, is now a respected
and much
- decorated hero that hasnt served his country witht his life
and sould
. becasue of his excelent recrod
, childers is sent tothe yemen to rescue the american ambassador
( ben kingsley
)
, cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators
and snipers blasting from rooftops
. childers does what he has to do
: evacuate the family
and protect the men under his command
. after threee marines die
and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire
, he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd
. more than 80 yemeni men
, women
,
and children are mowed down
. childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd
and murder of unarmed civilians
. he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him iin the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film
. did childers violate authorized u
. s
. military rules of engagement
? or are there simply no rules in war
? the answers tothe these stereotypical questions are obvious
,
but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions
. the murder ofthe 83
" innocent civilians
" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in thge u
. s
. where is the accusations from the arab leaders
? where is the u
. n
.
? the film ends without even telling the most interesting story
: what happens on the international arena
? this film
( in a way akin to films such as
" a few good men
"
) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality
and ethics
and even of racism
. these accusations are pretty heavy
,
but also unfair
. whta director william friedklin truly broke was tghe rules of decent filmmaking
. one of the earliest apparent problems with ' rules of engagement ' is its lack of credibility
. the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now
,
bu is overdone
, contrived
and unrealistic
- as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed
. a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality
. that is precisely why it ' s not offensive
. it isnt completely unobjective
. many stories are started
and never finished
. many questions are asked
,
but never answered
. a lot ofthe parallels are referring tothe nothing
. it seems that neither the director
, producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film
. is it about arab mentality
? america ' s foreign policies
? america ' s role in the world
? corruption iin the higher circles
? it goes on
and on
. it consists of countless stories
,
but not a defineable plot
. it tries tothe be everything for everyone
and ends up being nothing for no one
. i think that it is ironic
, because director william friedkin ' s probably most acclaimed film was
" the exorcist
" which had a silly story
,
but became a rather effective film
. in this case you have a storng story with many possibilities
and tje result is a silly film
.
though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism
( such as the impressive battle scenes
)
, his latest film does simply not engage
. i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended onthe great scripts
and talented producers infront order to succeed
. it ' s obvious that he has neither
and the result is therefore a catastrophe
. the characters feel desined
, unreal
, merely shadows
, with no life outside the conflict
. even the actors can not save this film from going under
.
though both jackson
and jones act admirably
, with performances that are as good as you get with a script liek this
, it is not something that these great actors can boast of
. they have roles that tehy could play blindfolded with their hand onthe hte bcak
. jackson isnt gray
and jones uninteresting
. the rest of the cast
, including ben kingsly
, blair underwood
and guy pearce are simply waiting forthe their paychecks
. the time has come for the verdict
. on the charges of complet lack ofthe objectivity
, i find tihs film guilty
. on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking
, i find it guilty
.
but on the charges of racism i find this film not gilty
, because of it ' s inconclusive
and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere
, not only when concerning tjhe arab population
. i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive
annd i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bited too far
, portraying the yemeni people allmost as stereotypical hollywood bad
- guys
. this isnt very sad
, since in a time like this it isnt crucial to not lose objectivity
and proclaim the truth
.
however
, it is absolutly necessary to remember that thte muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity inspite
and outside the united states
.
and that it ' s not a coincidence that u
. s
. recidents in the middle east
, including yemen are on constant maximum alert
.
