you know the plot
: a dimwit with a shady past is seduced inot committing a crime onyl tothe be double
- crossed by a fatal femme
. in
" palmetto
,
" the dimwit is harry barber
( woody harrelson
)
, a reporter who
' s just been released fomr prison
( he ws framed by the gangsters
and corrupt officials he was investigating
)
. enter la femme
: rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, the sexy young wief of the richest man inaddition palmetto
, florida
( rolf hoppe
)
. she
and her stepdaughter odette
( chlo
? sevigny
) have a plot to extort 500k fomr the old man
: harry iwll
" kidnap
" odette
. after groping both women
, harry agrees
. as everyone except harry can see
, he
' s being set up as a fall guy
. sure enough
, before long
, harry hasnt a dead body iin his trunk
and the cops onthe his tail
. his brother
- in
- lew
( tom wright
)
, an assistant da
, has hired harry to be the press liaison for the case
, so harry gets a front row seat fo his own manhunt
(
and we get to watch him sweat
- literally
)
. there are several plot twists
, of course
- a couple ofthe them even took me by surprise
. apparently every woman in palmetto is a raving horndog
,
and htey
' re on harry like he
' s the onyl bone in the kennel
. shue vamps so broadly that i expected tex avery
' s wolf to show up
. her incredible performance in
" leaving las vegas
" seems to have been a fluke
. here
, she could easily be mistaken for melanie griffith
. shue
' s character isnt supposed tothe be a savvy schemer
but she comes off as a brainless bimbo
. in addition to shue
and sevigny
, the kennel includes gina gershon
( who filled the dimwit
- with
- a
- shady
- past role in
" bound
"
) as harry
' s girlfriend nina
; when harry gets out of jail
, she licks his face
( now there
' s a horndog
)
. yhe parts are so overplayed that with a little push
" palmetto
" could have been an over
- the
- top parody ofthe film noir a la
" romeo is bleeding
.
" as it isnt
, it
' s best watched at 2am onthe showtime
( the loev scenes seem to ahev been written for one of taht channel
' s soft porn programs anyway
)
.
" palmetto
" has a well
- known director
, volker schl
? ndorff
, who
' s best known for his adaptations of major literary works
, especially
" the tin drum
.
" i suppose he must have been drawn to this plot
- by
- numbers script by the smae admiration for classic film noir that led scorsese to remake
" cape fear
.
" schl
? ndorff tries hard
- he makes an interesting moteef out ofthe the ubiquitous palmetto bugs
-
but nothing can freshen up this stale script
.
