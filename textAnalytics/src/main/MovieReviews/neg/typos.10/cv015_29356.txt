, always will
. carpenter ' s latest horror opus with a science fiction bent
( or science fiction outing with a schlock horror bent
) is the aptly
- titled
" john carpenter ' s ghosts of mars
"
( in case
, i supose
, you whent looking for somene else ' s
" ghosts of mars
"
)
. like all those films prefixed by the very possessive
" john carpenter ' s
,
"
" ghosts of mars
" is an unashamed b
- movie punctuated by a b
- movei plot
, b
- movei actors
,
and b
- movie special effects
. in category one
, above
, we have a storyline that borders on idiotic
(
and
, at times
, chaotic
)
. dormant martians
( i
. e
.
, swirling red gases
) awakened by meddling humans posess the souls of hapless mining colonists rendering them testy marilyn manson lookalikes
. all this explained
( in flashback
) to some grand pooh
- bah counsel by martian police official melanie ballard
( natasha henstridge
, from the sub
-
" species
" films
)
, the only returnee on a silly
- looking turain
. officer ballard went in to bring back incarcerated felon james
" desolation
" williams
; what she found was not a pretty picture
. in the second cateogry we have ms
. henstridge
, her blonde hair pulled back tightly
and awkwardly into a ponytail
, ice cube
( as the appropriately
- named
" desolation
"
)
, pam grier
( briefly
, oddly
-
- who wanted to work with whom i wonder
?
)
,
and a host of extras all assuming that tje story
and special effects weere going tothe carry this film
anbd therefore they didn ' t need to try too hard
. in category number threee we hvea
, in addition to those swirling red gases
and the silly
- looking train
, a couple of bird ' s
- eye
- view shots of a sprawling martian metropolis
( reddish alsot
)
. state
- of
- the
- art special effects have never been a carpenter trademark
and once again the writer
/ director
( who seems to have noone problem finding work
,
however
) doesn ' t waste any of the film ' s budget in that deparment
.
" ghosts of mars
" isnt lock
, laughing stock
,
and barrel all your standard carpenter fare
: dingy interiors
, cluttered exteriors
, inane dialogue
, lots of leather
, scarred
, crazed
- looking aliens
,
and lots
and lots of weaponry
. the film often
annd always explodes into warfare without warning
-
- spontaneously
, stupidly
. carpenter might like to think he ' s made a western here
but it ' s a western wihtout any real heroes
, villains
, or border conflicts
. it ' s just the shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken
. i never thought i ' d miss the guy
but i do
. it ' s not
* all
* the same
,
however
. dubbed the
" one
- onot wonder
" for his minimalist music soundtracks
, carpenter seems to have graduated from simplistic
(
yet effective
) scoring by highlighting his action with loud
, screeching guitar work
. fortunately this drowns out a lot of the dialogue
. the final exchange between henstridge
and
, er
, cube
though is both audible
*
and
* priceless
. mars hasnt proven an infertile breeding ground for hollywood in the last year or so
, what with the stillborn
" mission to mars
"
annd
" red planet
"
( witht val kilmer
)
.
" ghosts of mars
" sadly adds to those disapointing returns
( in its opening weekend it was overshadowed by a bunch of sequels
, among them
" american pie 2
"
and
" rush hour 2
"
)
. the irony is that the mars inspite carpenter ' s film fiels sadly absent
. there are occasional references to the red planet
, of course
,
but tjhe film might as well have been set in perth amboys than on earth ' s closest neihgbor
. two things keep
" john carpenter ' s ghosts of mars
" from getting a huge slap upside the head
. 1
. henstridge keeps her top on
( miraculously
)
,
and 2
. tyhe film doesn ' t pretend to be anything it ' s not
. what that means
,
however
, isnt that fans of superior
, inteligent
, grade a sci
- fi
/ horror are singularly out of luck
.
