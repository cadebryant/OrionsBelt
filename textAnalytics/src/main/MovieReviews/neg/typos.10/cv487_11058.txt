adam s
andler turns uv the charm inspite his latest romantic comedy
, tghe wedding singer
. unfortunately
, that aslo has the effect of softening his edge
. he
' s nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore
, not that it was much of one
. he
' s certainly not helped here by a rether frail plot
. the year is 1985
, letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia
. adam s
andler is nice guy robbie
, the titular wedding singer
, who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits
. robbie
' s life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
, leaves him at the altar
.
however
, things are looking up when he meets julia
( drew barrymore
)
, a waitress at the hall
. she
' s the perfect woman
,
but for one small flwa
: she
' s engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king
, glenn
( matthew glave
)
. so
, most of the film deals with the slow relization by robbie that he
and julia are in love
,
and his attempts to stop the wedding
. as far as plots go
, it
' s a pretty thin
and tired one
. tothe fill the gaps
, the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia
. fomr boy george to michael jackson
, from miami vice to dallas
, from the first cds to the last rubik
' s cubes
, htis film revels in all the minutiae
.
and
then htere
' s the music
.
.
. learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank
,
and romy
and michele
' s high school reunion
, this film packs more 80s songs inwhich thte film than the running time will allow
. as a result
, most songs get maybe a lyric or a half
, bu you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives
' eyes
: the wedding singer vols
. 2
, 3
,
and 4
! while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring
, at least they distract ytou from the plot
. at least last year
' s my best friend
' s wedding stirred up the st
andard
" keep your true love from marrying someone else
" plot by making the rival a nice person
. here
, glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him
. barrymore
, on the other h
and
, is simply charming as julia
. which leaves us with adam s
andler
. he
' s at his best in yhe film when his nice guy persona fades a little
( such as when he has a breakdown onthe stage during a wedding reception
)
. when he
' s in full nice
- guy mode
, he
' s more pathetic thna endearing
. the film boasts several cameos
( most notably by steve buscemi
and jon lovitz
)
.
but none of them work well at all
. buscemi
' s role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous
. lovitz
, on the other h
and
, as a rival wedding singer
, makes you long for his ogod old days on saturday night live
, where he was actually funny
. the only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during thge film
' s finale
( surprisingly
, one of yhe only plot
- related scenes which actually works
.
) adam s
andler still has some wokr to do before he can become a dependable leading man
. while he attempts to change his omage in the wedding singer
, the end result is no net gain
.
