don
' t get me wrong
-
- i tend to appreciate besson
' s naive
, unashamedly romantic worldview
, an artsy european sensibility gone thouroughly hollywood
. his 1994 leon is exciting
and absurdly moving
, thanks mainly to thge interplay between jean reno annd a young natalie portman
,
and 1997
' s the fifth element is a goofy paean to love
, l
- u
- v
, that
' s even more of a hoot on repeated viewings
.
but his joan of arc is a mess
, despite some stirring battle scenes
and the mostly knockout presense of a close
- cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself
. jovovich
, besson
' s own personal muse through the making of his last two films
(
though htey
' ve since separated
)
, is magnetic
and energetic enought to play a credible joan
( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior
,
but also a fabulous
, supermodel
- level babe
)
.
and besson remains a servicable acation film director
,
though not an especially facile one
. leading her army against the seamingly impenetrable fortresses of the english
, joan
' s struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring
,
and besson helps you underst
and how the french could beleive
, fervently
, that god is on her side
. besson
' s big misteek
, i think
, is trying to dramatize the interior life ofthe his subject
. yes
, joan had visions
-
-
but i guarantee thta whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures inthe its collective mind will be more compelling tahn the blue
- eyed christ figure on display in besson
' s hallucinatory dream sequences
. the whole conceet turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman
( billed as
" the conscience
"
) shows up
, spouting platitudes
and sending poore milla running around her cell
, babbling like ally mcbeal
. that
' s kind of a shame
, usance she doens quite well uv to that point
, charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness
. that darkly attractive aspect of her character
-
- that she
' s as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord
-
- is more or less betrayed by the final reels
, in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she
' s overseen adn joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who
' s about to take a fall
. as the story winds down
, with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire
, besson is aiming for tragedy
and psychological significance
. trouble is
, he
' s chosen a lurid
, often jokey tone for the balance ofthe the picture
-
- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes
-
-
and it
' s impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is
, to a great extent
, nothing more than a put
- on
. htis glib
, pre
- fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grtaeful for dreyer
' s the passion of joan of arc
( 1928
)
, a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan
' s trial
,
and which st
ands as oney ofthe the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema
. compared to that film
, the messenger plays as a crime against histry
.
