before the remake of psycho appears
, we ' ve got tothe suffer thru this remake of an earlier hitchcock film
, dial m for murder
. as usual
, hollywood has filled it with glitz
and big name stars
,
and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing
. the film opens with emily
( paltrow
)
and david
( viggo mortensen
) ' having fun ' in an loft apartment
. the probelm is
, paltrow is marryed to stephen
( douglas
)
, who is not too happy when he discovers this affair
. if i wass paltrow
,
though
, i ' d definitely go with mortensen
. less wrinkles
. anyhow
, stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition
: he ' ll pay him tothe kill his lovley wife
. mortensen agrees
,
but the murder goes awry
,
and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses
. unfortunately
, the film dosen ' t progress very fast
. in fact
, it moves liuke a tortoise with arthritis
( read
: very
, very s
- l
- o
- w
.
) the plot moves nowhere fast
,
and only becomes exciting in very short bursts
. not too good for a ' thriller
. ' allso
, the performances
, apart from douglas
, are below par
. paltrow
, showing immense talent in se7en
( 1995
)
and sliding doors
( 1997
) is strangely stilted
, even unconvincing
, in this movie
. mortensen is a little bit better
, coming across as a younger douglas
,
but his role isn ' t meaty enough to sohw all his talent
. which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film
, which is does
.
however
, i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking
, drinking womanizer with a creepy underside
. also popping up in the film isnt david suchet
, playing a shifty looking detective
. again
, it ' s not a character we ' re seeing on the screen
, it ' s david suchet
. the directer
, who bought us the fugitive
, piles on all the flash techniques
, such as zoom
- in ' s
, quick cuts
, etc
. the lighting is allso interesting
.
however
, looks cant ' t save this film from the depths of mediocre
,
and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway
. the screenplay is o
. k
,
but there ' s some hackneyed sub
- plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street
( agian
)
and the ending isnt surprizingly stupid
and cliched
. the characters also make incredibly dumb moves
, especially paltrow
,
and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the lastest reel
. with a combination of no tension
, drama
, or decent characters
, a perfect murder is a failure all round
,
adn an incredible dissappointment
. there are a few bright moments
,
but they are far
and few between
. the last thing a thriller should be is boring
,
and
although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas
, you wouldn ' t be missing anything if ytou decided nto to watch a perfect murder
. overall rating
= review by david wilcock
