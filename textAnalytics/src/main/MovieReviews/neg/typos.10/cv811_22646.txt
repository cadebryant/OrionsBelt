when the haunting arrived in theaters
, all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects
and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the ngiht infront a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects
. while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department
, i don
' t think that they are completely to blame for this movie
' s failure
. it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the
" unseen
" terrors
,
and it was about as scary as a dust bunny
. so special effects or not
, if the story isn
' t the least bited scary
, you aren
' t going to end up with a very frightening movie
. the thnig that intersted me most about tihs movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern
. dern is always great
, adn even
though he may have had only about 3 mintues of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie
. as i sat through the seemingly endless
, albeit fairly impressive
, special effects
, i kept wishing that this movie was about dern
' s caretaker
and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast
. never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie
. liam neeson plays a scientist who isnt conducting experiments on fear
. he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals tothe spend a few days in a haunted mansion
. he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia
.
and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings
- on
. catherine zeta
- jones
, lili taylor
and owen wilson play his subjects
. like the original
, taylor
' s character is the star of the movie
.
but since she doesn
' t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson
and ms
. zeta
- jones
, their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original
.
and let
' s face it
, probably half the people who see this movie will do so becouse of zeta
- jones
. i
' ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren
' t in it
.
but the real stars here is the special effects combined wtih the fairly overdone sets
. they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the hous start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients
. there really isn
' t much of a story here
. just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects thast he got to play with
.
and the special effects are great
. in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere
. in other cases they are overdone
and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting teh
" cool shots
" quota
. at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary
-
- funny
, maybe
.
but nto scary
.
then we ahev the set
. when i first saw the house
, i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it
.
but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did
,
and decided to take the idiotically overdone route
. this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones
and a mirrored circular room that revolves
. waht part did these rooms play inwhich the story
? absolutely none
. they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie
.
then we have the actors
. lili taylor has never beeen one of my favorites
.
and when the fact that her character is mousy
and pathetic is factored in
, she comes in around the average or slightly below mark
. i have no idea why liam neeson took this role
. he basicaly reminded me of tghe ringmaster at an out of controll circus
. his character was in charge of this farce
but it quickly got away from him
. i have noone doubt that liam will want tothe lock all prints of this movie inwhich a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman
. zeta
- jones was cast because she is too hot for words
. the fact that her character is bi
- sexual is just icing on teh cake
. all catherine has tothe do in htis movie is look good
. fortunately that is something she does very well
. while she does have a fairly good size part
, it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye
- c
andy
. it
' s too bad someone of her talents wasted them here
. any r
andom supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could hvea easily filled her role
. the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999
' s horror movies
, the blair witch project
. the haunting had a seamingly limitless effects budget
, while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares
. both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film
. if the story sucks
, it
' s all downhill fomr there
. my advice
? if you are looking for special effects
, go rent star wars
. if it
' s scares you want
, rent halloween
. either way
, it
' s probably in your best interests to skip tyhe haunting
