of course i knew this going in
. why is it that whenever a tv
- star makes a movie it ' s allways a romantic comedy
,
and
then they say on entertainment tonight or something
, that they were
" attracted to the characters
. they weere realy original
.
" orginial
?
! let me give you a run
- through of picture perfect
: character a
) kate
( jennifer aniston
, from tv ' s friends
)
, a smart
, beautyfull
, professional woman wants two things she can ' t have
: a new job
- title
anbd the love of her co
- worker kevin bacon
. her boss will only give her the job if she gets married
and gets a mortgage
and gets a lease on a german sportscar
,
and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls
. what does she do
? she invents a fiance
!
then when everyone wants to meet him
, she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him
$ 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner
,
and pick a fight with her at the end
, thus breaking the engagment
but still being able to keep her job
, since the guy ends up looking like a jerk
and she is the poore
, defenceless female
. he
, of course
, goes along with it
. gee
, i wonder if they get together inaddition the end
. i ' ve seen more original stuff on the wb
.
adn better stuff too
. picture perfect also makes the mistake of being
_ wayyyyy
_ too long at 100 minutes
,
and expecting us to like aniston ' s character
, who comes off as a cold
, spoiled bitch
.
