well
, here
' s a distasteful
, thoroughly amateurish item that
, suprisingly
, was actually a box
- office hit at the time of its release
. after just viewing the film for the first time
, my primary question is how did anyone with an iq north of 35 enjoy this movei
? it is cheap
, idiotic
, unfunny
,
and not nearly as raunchy as i had heared it was
. at least some smut would ahve livened things up a bit
.
" porky
' s
,
" tells the story
( if you can call it that
) of four clueless high school buddies
, pee wee
( dan monahan
)
, billy
( mark herrier
)
, tommy
( wyatt knight
)
,
and mickey
( roger wilson
)
, whom desperately want to get laid
. women
, for the most part
, are a mystery to them
(
and in this movie
, htey are tothe teh audeince
, as well
, since all of them are written
and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet
)
. their plan is sidetracked
,
however
, when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky
' s
, which they are able to get into using fake id
' s
. after they pay the manager one
- hundred bucks for three hookers
, they are played a trick onthe
and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building
. for these four teenage guys
, this means war on porky
' s
.
" porky
' s
,
" ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level
. as a teenage sex
- romp
, it is not wild or amusing enough
. as a comedy
, all ofthe the jokes are predictable
and fall flat
. as a look back at teh 1950
' s
, it is something
, i suspect
, most people fomr tath era would want to bury deepo in a grave
.
and as a revenge movie
, it is a crushing bore
. one ofthe the most offensive things about
,
" porky
' s
,
" is how jaw
- droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers
. the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters
,
and we learn vyer little about them
, except that they are horny adn would probably feel mroe comfortable in a preschool
. that sure is revealing information
. the female charactors fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay annd direction by bob clark
. the women are all treated as objects or comedy props
, rather than real people
. for example
, the two gym teachers
, mrs
. balbricker
( nancy parsons
)
and honeywell
( kim cattrall
)
, only have one purpose
,
and that is to be made fun of
. mrs
. balbricker is a gruff
, no
- holds
- barred
, overwight woman who wiull not st
and for any foolishness
,
and
, in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved
, honeywell has sex with a coach
and barks like a dog
. there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses
( even
though i have the suspicion they are not
)
,
but one thing is fo sure
: they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny
, only humiliating
. to prove how out
- of
- touch this so
- called comedy is
, compare it to other more serious 80
' s films about teenagers
,
and it looks even worse in comaprison
. any of tje john hughes pictures
, such as 1984
' s
" sixteen c
andles
,
" or
, 1985
' s
" the breakfast club
,
" put
,
" porky
' s
,
" at an even greater shame
. those films actually dealt with serious teen matters
, bu remained a great deal funnier
, thanks to their bright
and truthful writing
.
and heck
, if
,
" porky
' s
,
" wanted to be a teenage sex movie
, i
' d take 1982
' s
" fast times at ridgemont high
,
" or 1982
' s
" the last american virgin
,
" over this any day of the week
. director bob clark is not a bad director
. two years after he made
,
" porky
' s
,
" he directed the nostalgic holiday classic
,
" a christmas story
.
" i would forgive him for this misfire
, in fatc
, if it wasn
' t for tje fatc that he also wroet the screenplay
. just the
thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage
, anbd think that it ws actually a film worth releasing unt the unsuspecting world
, is actually a whole lot funnier than anytying in
,
" porky
' s
.
