the year is barely a week ood
,
and there is already a c
andidate forthe the worst of 1997
-
- the relic
, a would
- be chiller that
' s more sucesful at making the audiance laugh than scream
. in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams
( whose lastest two pictures were dreadful jean
- claude van damme vehicles
)
, a creature that feeds on thte hypothalamuses
( hypothalamii
?
) ofthe humans
and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum
. how did this creature come into existence
,
and why does it feed on hormones
? the
" scientific
" explanation cooked up by the four
-
- yes
, four
-
- credited screenwriters
( amy holden jones
, john raffo
, rick jaffa
,
and am
anda silver
) takes
" suspension of disbelief
" to new heights
, even by monster movie st
andards
.
but as cockamamie as the science is in the film
, it isn
' t quite as hard tothe swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics
. miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination
, turning eveyr scene that requires the slightest display of emotion inot an overblown oscar clip
, complete with piercing wails
and glycerine tears
. give it up
, penelope
-
- it
' s a
_ monster
_ movie
_
. on the flip side
, tom sizemore just phones inwhich his performance as a police lieutenant
,
but his role is so thankless tht it
' s hard to imagine it being played any more effectively
. it
' s qutie funny to see a film indulge
, with the straightest of faces
, in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well
(
and so recently
) in scream
. for example
, in one early scene
, a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night
. ok
, we all know what
' s coming
,
but as if we didn
' t need any more confirmation
, he pulls out a joint
and starts puffing away
. everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie
. anbd later
, miller frantically runs out ofthe a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing
. does she make a beeline for the front door
? ofthe course nto
-
- she runs inot the ladies room
and cowers in a stall
. with all the cliches
, it is only fitting the film
' s climax offers what is perhpas tjhe most overused one in recent film
: that ofthe someone outrunning a fireball
. if the relic is truley
" the enxt evolution in terror
" as tjhe poster states
,
then the horror film
-
-
and humanity
-
- is in even worse shape than we
thought
.
