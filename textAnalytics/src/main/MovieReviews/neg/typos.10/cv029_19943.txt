one
- sided
" doom
and gloom
" documentry about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible
. orson welles narrates annd appears in the film in which he
, along with best
- selling author hal lindsey
, discusses various prophecies from the bible
and relates them to recent
( well for 1976 anyway
) events
. the film is dated badly
, as many thnigs that are supposed to happen in the
" future
" never do
. for example
, the planets of the solar system were supposed tothe line up infact the year 1982
and cause chaos here on earth
. we
' re still here
. the arms race between the soviets
and america was supposted to kick
- off the apocalypse
. we
' re still here
. some ofthe the more ludicrous moments come when it
' s alluded to that people like jimmy carter
and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist
(
!
)
. also
, there
' s ten mintues of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like
. if it
' s anything like it
' s depicted as here
then it
' s going to be incredibly boring
. the lite great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video
. it contains the film in st
andard form
( aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 33
: 1
)
,
al
though some moments ofthe stock footage are letterboxed
. also included are brief bios on orson welles
and hal lindsey
, as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release
, chariots of the gods
. audio is mono dolby digital
,
and the video is fair to ogod for a film like this
. i believe this is the first appearance of this film onthe any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me
. certainly i never expected a remastered print
. curiously
, the menu screens on thsi dvd look nothing liuke the meu screens pictured on thge back of tyhe case
.
but they
' re menu screens
.
.
. so who really cares
?
