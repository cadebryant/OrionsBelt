disillusioned
and trying to find the spice of life
, richard
( leonardo dicaprio
) sets off for thail
and
. there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy
( robert carlyle
) who gives him a map to a beach
, a secrect utopia
,
then commits suicide
. richard sets off fo this beach with his neighbors from this hotel
,
? tienne
( guillaume canet
)
and fran
? oise
( virginie ledoyen
)
. once htey get there the three discover a secret society existing onthe htis beach
, there richard falls forthe fran
? oise
. this covers about half to two thirds of the movie
and aside from the romantic element
, which is solely a creation of hollywood
, seems to hold to the origional novel
. the cinematography
and general beauty of this part ofthe the movei is breathtaking
. i don
' t think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning
.
but that is were many things go wrong
, darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography
.
though the script
and the interpretation of the novel are qutie lacking
. the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts
. this is where the movie has some great potential
,
then the three travelers get the isl
and
and htere is a turn for the better
, yes folks i said better
. nowe up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good
, nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography
but it still has promise
. this is where things start tothe degenerate to something that becomes almost un
- watchable
. there is even a
' video game
' style sequence that borders on the disgusting
, it doesn
' t make sense for the movie
and just looks dumb in my opinion
( annd i am hoping many otehr peoples
)
. i am hoping that in my little rant i
' ve made it abundantly clear that the movie isnt lacking quite seriously infront plot
and uneven pacing
, so if you go see it
and you don
' t like it because of htis don
' t blaim me
. the character development was not uv to par either
; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child
.
al
though htere is a feeble attempt tothe make this whole story profound it fails
and richard
( leo
' s character
) comes off as a wannabe philosopher
. the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go
and seems to just do things for no apparent reason
, granted some people are like this
( myself included
)
but i nor anyone i know that is fairly r
andom would ever do things of the sort this character does
. the next point isnt that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough
. richard is obviously obsessed by fran
? oise at the eearly stages ofthe the story
,
yet there is actually very little development along this story line
. this i am sure conti
butes to the movei
' s lack of core plot
and bieng unfocused
. now
, i shall move onto something a little better about the movie
( for all ytou cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it
)
. the cast
and acting was passable at the very least
,
and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard
. mind you i think the rest ofthe the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better
. which begs the question why isnt leonardo paid so much
?
( i think tihs is a topic all on its pwn so i won
' t get inot it
)
.
but i like the fact that there was an international cast used
, had only
and american cast been used i cant see this movie being horrible
. the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable
. nto to mention the movie is set in thail
and
and a global cast makes mroe sense
. when all is said
and done i liked the movie for the most part
but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable
. i would not recommend thsi movie tothe anyone
, the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography anbd the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story
. as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical
and fails at its attempt
. if you do end uv goign to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings
.
