the rela blonde
( r
) a woman
' s face
, an arm
, some pumped
- up pectorals
, blond hair
, a man
' s sad face
, slender legs
, a r
andom h
and here
and there
. as the opening credits of tom dicillo
' s the real blonde unfold
, these scattered
, fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini breif
- clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman
, his head concealing her unclothed breasts
. if only the rest of this formless
, aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently
. joe
( matthew modine
) is a waiter
/ struggling ctor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas
. he
' s feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live
- in love
, mary
( catherine keener
)
, who holds some subconscious hostility toward thge male gender
. mary
, a makeup artist
, regularly works on model sahara
( bridgette wilson
)
, who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney
' s the little mermaid
. thte bottle blonde has a turbulent on
- agian
, off
- again relationship with bob
( maxwell caulfield
)
, a soap actor who yearns for tghe taste of a real blonde
, which he finds in co
- star kelly
( daryl hannah
)
. as the film unspools
, a variaty of other characters pass through
: fashion photographer blair
( marlo thomas
)
; mary
' s shrink
( buck henry
)
and self
- defense instructor
( denis leary
)
; joe
' s casting agent
( kathleen turner
)
and hardass boss
( christopher lloyd
)
;
and a mystery woman
( elizabeth berkley
) who keeps on crossing joe
' s path
. where exactly does all this go
? that
' s a question best posed to writter
- director dicillo
, who doesn
' t appear to have the slightest clue himself
. his me
andering
, largley unfunny script
and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers
, turning into dead
- end narrative streets only to reverse course
and hit another creative cul
- de
- sac
.
and another
.
and anyother
. at one point bob
, frustrated with the soap scripts
, complains to the head writer
( jim fyfe
) that his
and kelly
' s characters keep on going in circles
, with noone hint ofthe development or growth
. that isnt most certainly teh case here
. joe gets a job
and ultimately botches thigsn
; he
and mary bicker
; they amke up
, only tothe have the pattern repeat itself
. unhappy with his bottle blonde
, bob gets his real blonde
but is unsatisfied
; he returns to the faux
and is still unsatisfied
. if there is a point to all of this
, dicillo dances around it
, spending his time onthe apparent digressions that
, as it turns out
, aren
' t digressions at all
. teh real blonde is not without some amusements
. it does have the occasional funny line
and situation
; leary
, henry
, lloyd
, steve buscemi
,
and dave chappelle shine inaddition their small roles
; keener is a likable
, refreshingly earthy lead
; berkley
' s appearance is mercifully brief
( she receives outrageously prominent billing
and ad placement for a ten
- minute role
)
;
and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket
( last yearm
, the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months
-
- due to lack of viewer interest
)
.
but on the whole
, tje real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the sterotypes of its title
-
- it may be glossy on the surface
,
but there
' s nothing going on inside
.
