the real blonde
( r
) a woman ' s face
, an arm
, some pumped
- up pectorals
, blond hair
, a man ' s sad face
, slender legs
, a random hand here
and there
. as the opening credits of tom dicillo ' s the real blonde unfold
, theese scattered
, fractured glimpses eventually come together to form teh image of a bikini brief
- clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman
, his head concealing her unclothed breasts
. if only the rest of this formless
, aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently
. joe
( matthew modine
) is a waiter
/ struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas
. he ' s feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live
- inthe love
, mary
( catherine keener
)
, who holds soem subconscious hostility toward the male gender
. mary
, a makeup artist
, regularly works on model sahara
( bridgette wilson
)
, who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney ' s the little mermaid
. the bottle blonde has a turbulent on
- again
, off
- again relationship with bob
( maxwell caulfield
)
, a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde
, which he finds in co
- star kelly
( daryl hannah
)
. as the film unspools
, a variety of other characters pass through
: fashion photographer blair
( marlo thomas
)
; mary ' s shrink
( buck henry
)
and self
- defense instructor
( denis leary
)
; joe ' s casting agent
( kathleen turner
)
and hardass boss
( christopher lloyd
)
;
and a mystery woman
( elizabeth berkley
) who keeps on crossing joe ' s path
. where exactly doens all this go
? that ' s a question best posed to writer
- director dicillo
, who doesn ' t appear to have the slightest clue himself
. his meandering
, largely unfunny scirpt
and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers
, turning into dead
- end narrative streets only to reverse course
and hit another creative cul
- de
- sac
.
adn anohter
.
and another
. at one point bob
, frustrated with the soap scripts
, complains to tyhe head writer
( jim fyfe
) that his
and kelly ' s characters keep on going in circles
, with no hint of development or growth
. that is most certainly the case here
. joe gets a job
and ultimately botches things
; he
and mary bicker
; they make up
, only to have the pattern repeat itself
. unhappy with his bottle blonde
, bob gets his real blonde
but is unsatisfied
; he returns to the faux
annd is still unsatisfied
. if there is a point tothe all of this
, dicillo dances around it
, spending his time on apparent digressions that
, as it turns out
, aren ' t digressions at all
. the real blonde is not without some amusements
. it does have the occasional funny line
and situation
; leary
, henry
, lloyd
, steve buscemi
,
and dave chappelle shine in their small roles
; keener is a likable
, refreshingly earthy lead
; berkley ' s appearance is mercifully breif
( she receives outrageously prominate billing
adn ad placement for a ten
- minute role
)
;
annd there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket
( last year
, tghe actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months
-
- due to lack of viewer interest
)
.
bu on the whole
, the real blonde is a frustrating sit thgat lives up to the stereotypes of its title
-
- it may be glossy on the surfce
,
bu there ' s nothing going on inside
.
