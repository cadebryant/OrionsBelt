porter stoddard
( warren beatty
) is a successful archictect marryied to successful fabric designer ellie
( diane keaton
) for twenty
- five years
. they
and best friends mona
( goldie hawn
)
and griffin
( garry shandling
) are about to face marital crises inwhich a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen
,
" town
and country
.
"
" town
anbd ocuntry
" has a pedigree befitting it ' s title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker
adn mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry
(
" the graduate
"
) under the direction ofthe peter chelsom
(
" funny bones
"
)
. after years of reports of budget overruns
and reshoots
and the racking up twelve different release dates
, the media has been prepped for beatty ' s enxt
" ishtar
.
" so
, is it that bad
? the answer is no
.
but it ' s nto very good either
. the major problem with
" town
and country
" isnt that it ' s unstructured
and random
. stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer
, hvaing jstu bedded a flaky cellist
( nastassja kinski
)
. next scene finds him
anbd ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona
and griffin
.
thn mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel
and begins divorce proceedings
( buck henry cameos as both couples ' divorce lawyer
)
. ellie thinks she ' s overeacting
,
but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family ' s mississippi manse
. the two childhood friends end up infact bed together
, making us wonder why they ' d never become a couple to begin with
. back home
, their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter ' s cheating on her
. porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley
, idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts tothe tell him that he ' s gay
. the four friends
, along wih every woman porter ' s dallied with
, all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after
.
although the film begins promisingly
, resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps
, too many strands drift off into nowhere
. the stoddard household is huge
, containing two adult children
( josh hartnett
,
" the virgin suicides
"
and tricia vessey
,
" kiss the girls
"
)
, their colorful bedmates
annd a maid who ' s jstu imported her shirtless boyfriend from tyhe rainforest back home
. after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search ofthe a nocturnal snack
, the six supporting players are dropped except for an out
- ofthe
- nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son
. porter ' s romantic misadventures with women
( other than mona
) are equally mishandled
. once the marital discord beigns
, the film seems as if it was editted with a machettie
, stopping
and starting
, never regaining its rhythm
. while beatty gets off a few tart observations
, his character is mostly passive
and bemused
. maybe we ' re supposed to fiel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn ' t initiate his own sex romps
? keaton ' s ellie has a trusting nature that ' s a result of her pwn self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character
. hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of
" the out of towners
"
and
" the first wives ' club
" while shandling ' s relegated to true second banana status
. kinski is bland
and unmotivated
. andie macdowell tkaes a weirdly unappealing role
and does what she can with the screenplay ' s most bizarre subplot
, which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting
, billionaire daddy
and marian seldes as her alcoholic
, wheelchair
- bound
, foul
- mouthed mother
. heston
and seldes are fun
, as isnt jenna elfman as a sun valley bait
and tackle salesgirl who brings porter
and griffin to a halolween party
. oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives thge film a nice look
,
but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily
and blackly humorous depth he brought tothe films like
" hear my song
"
and
" funny bones
.
" the scirpt is this film ' s weakest link
- it ' s telling that most of the
( few
) laughs come from old
- fashioned physical slapstick
and the sight ofthe beatty in a bear suit
. while
" town
and country
" isn ' t exactly painful to sit through
, it mostly just lays there
.
