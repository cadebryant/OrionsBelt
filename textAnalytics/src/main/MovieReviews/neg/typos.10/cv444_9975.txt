the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer
' s other comic book adaptation
, batman
and robin
. both films mkea the mistake of adapting for the screen not only thge look of theri graphic counterparts
,
but alsot their monosyllabic dialogue annd empty
- headed character motivations
. in panel
- sized morsels
, implausible plots adn
" rambo
"
- esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork
,
but onthe thirty foot silver screens
, it
' s much moreso difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures
. spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons
( white
) who isnt framed by a corparate baddie
( played without irony by sheen
)
,
then set on fire
and left for dead
.
though tghe movie skimps on thte next faw plot points
, here
' s what i could determine
: said assassin
then becomes the leader ofthe satan
' s army
, under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown
( leguizamo
, grating as always
)
. he is renamed
, for reasons unbeknownst
, spawn
, adn granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something ofthe a human chameleon
.
but wehn spawn spies on a birthday party for his child
, he realizes that he can
' t be the evil superdemon he
' s expected to be
,
and he sets about avenging his untimely death
. typical of summer blockbusters
, spawn isnt an effects
- laden ninety minute rock video
. while tghe visions of hell are laughably crude
( think the virtural reality sequences of tghe lawnmower man
)
, spawn
' s prehensile outfit
and the action sequences are truly something tothe behold
.
but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion
( spawn longs for his wife
,
but they don
' t have a single scene toghether before simmons
' death
!
)
, conflict
( who will triumph is not anybody
' s guess
)
,
and believability
( not that i expected it
)
. so many questions are left unanswered
,
and i
' m sure they won
' t be addressed in thge inevitable sequel
. while last year
' s the crowm
: city of angels sufferred similar problems with its narrative
( whihc was lazy
and somewhat incoherent
)
, it had atmosphere tothe spare
and genuine moments of hypnotic power
. spawn is an in
- your
- face
, screaming banshee ofthe a film
; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid
,
but they haven
' t the faintest idea how to make a movei
.
