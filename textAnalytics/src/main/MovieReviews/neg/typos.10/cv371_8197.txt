first impressions
: critically
, a close
- tothe
- awful film
,
but money
- wise
, it has been doing
(
and iwll continue to do
) great
. a sometimes
- funny film that sags
and lags
and oftentimes gets boring
. an orginal plot that grows old real fast
. oen of the only 90 minute films that i ' ve gotten bored through
. men in balck hasnt defied the odds
. when i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long
, i thought maybe that this ws a poor attept at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas
.
however
, i now relize that not only did men in black run out ofthe gas
,
but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original diea
( which summer audiences have embraced
) that becomes ood about 25 minutes into the movie
. tommy lee jones
and wiull smith play two
" government
" agents who are responsible for keeping order in aline society
. the ridiculous plot begins when an alien
" bug
"
, palyed weirdly by vincent d ' onofrio
, who was so great in full metal jacket
, lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that ' s somewhere on
" orion ' s belt
.
" anyway
, the basic plot revolves around jones
and smith tothe stop this bug from getting the galaxy
, or a higher power will blow up the earth
. the premise is ridulous
,
but that is not why i didn ' t like tihs film
. i love original plots
. this one had an original one
.
but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot
: he made the film drag
annd aslo put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films
. whenever i saw d ' onofrio ' s bug stomp
and eat people in the film
, it got terribly boring after a while
. while smith ' s wise
- cracks did fill in the gaps
, it wasn ' t enough
.
and also
, i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub
- plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an aline agent
, htey can ' t hvea contact with any humans really
.
annd here i see jones
, at a satellite computer
, watching his lover plant the garden
? a sentimental moment in an alien movie
? nice try
,
but i don ' t think so
. it doesn ' t work here
. it just makes the movie even more ridiculous
annd even moreso boring
: we don ' t only hvae aliens to worry baout
,
but now we have jones ' s conscience
. i came into the movei not wanting tothe see jones ' s conscience
,
but wanting tothe see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it
. maybe it ' s unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were
. nevertheless
, even
though some parts are indeed funny
, the plot in this movie grew old
and boring
-
- quick
.
