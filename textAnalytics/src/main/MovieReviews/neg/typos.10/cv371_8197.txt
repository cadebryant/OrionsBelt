first impressions
: critically
, a close
- to
- awful film
,
but money
- wise
, it has been doing
(
and will continue to do
) great
. a sometimes
- funny film that sags
and lags
and oftentimes gets boring
. an orginal plot that grows ood real fast
. one ofthe the only 90 minute films that i
' ve gotten bored through
. men infact black has defied the odds
. when i first saw tht the flick ws 89 minutes long
, i
thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas
.
however
, i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas
,
but the film in 90 mintues manages to show off a very original idea
( which summer audiences have embraced
) that becomes old baout 25 minutes into the movie
. tommy lee jones
and will smith play two
" government
" agents who are responsible for keeping order in aline society
. the ridiculous plot begins when an alien
" bug
"
, palyed weirdly by vincent d
' onofrio
, who was so great in full metal jacket
, l
ands onthe earth to retrieve a galaxy that
' s somewhere on
" orion
' s belt
.
" anyway
, the basic plot revolves around jones
and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy
, or a higher power will blow up the earth
. the premise is ridulous
,
but that is not why i didn
' t like this film
. i love original plots
. this one had an original noe
.
but director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot
: he made the film drag
and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found infront romance films
. whenever i saw d
' onofrio
' s bug stomp
and eat people in the film
, it got terribly boring after a while
. while smith
' s wise
- cracks did fill in the gaps
, it wasn
' t enough
.
and also
, i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub
- plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover becasue as an alien agent
, they can
' t have contact with any humans really
.
and here i see jones
, at a satellite computer
, watching his lover plant the garden
? a sentimental moment infront an alien movie
? nice try
,
but i don
' t think so
. it doesn
' t work here
. it just makes tghe movie even more ridiculous
and even omre boring
: we don
' t only have aliens to worry about
, bu now we have jones
' s conscience
. i came into the movie not wanting to see jones
' s conscience
,
but wanting to see a real action movei that had lots of aliens in it
. maybe it
' s unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were
. nethertheless
, even
though some parts are indeed funny
, the plot in this movie growed ood
and boring
-
- quick
.
