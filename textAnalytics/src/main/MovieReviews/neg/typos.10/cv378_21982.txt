it should have been a classic
. a great cast of respected supporting actors
. an interesting premise of loser comic book charactors
.
however
,
" mistery men
" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999
. the jokes were bl
and
and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laff with their unique rituals
. the number of cliches
and shallow charactors made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of hvaing a fast paced premise
. the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film
but without a big laugh
- out
- loud joke
and mediocre small jokes
, it failed miserably at being entertaining at all
. the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons
. they had been used a number of times befor inspite previous films
, tjhe best ones
, which were mediocre to begin with
, were ruined in the trailer
,
and the expectation of laughing at clever
, unique gags from clever unique comedians when there weere none to laugh at greatly damaged the film
.
" mystery men
" might ahve worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business
.
but with veterans doing this kind of junk
, it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally
thought
. thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie
. the film follows a b
and of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens
and villains because ofthe their clumsiness
and failure to save they day
and capture hte bad guy
. the fact isnt these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero
, captain amazing
, who has recently captured every evil
- doer in the city
. captain amazing
( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear
)
, because of his success in the past
, is worried that he will lose popularity
. after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city
( geoffrey rush
, overacting just a bit too much
) tothe keep himself busy
, thnigs get out of h
and when captain amazing is captured
. it is uv to the wannabe superheroes to save the day
. by the time this section of the plot is finished
, the interest forthe whta happens
( if you haven
' t already figured it out
) is very low
. there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention
. the first scene in the film
, which shows the wannabes trying to save the day
, feels like it was seriously edited down
. right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk
' s hmeo by some masked goons
, captain amazing comes in
and saves the day
? or ruins the movie
. instead of editing this scene
, more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr
. furious
( ben stiller
) annd monica
, a waitress
( claire forlani
) or the vast majority of the film
, which is the heroes tlaking at a coffee table about how their day was
. a simple rule
: omre silly action is needed inthe order tothe make a silly action movei work
. another major problem with
" mystery men
" is that eveyr actor in it seemed very uncomfortable
and consequently gave terrible performances
. the film depended on its cast to work fluently together
, like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion
. howver
, most characters seemed like they did not even whant to be infront this film or at least thte script made it seem this way
. to pull oney of the actors in this film r
andomly out of a hat
, paul reubens
, who disappeared from acting to everyone
' s joy
, returns here leaving very little to be impressed about
. as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon
, all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes
. fart jokes that have all been heard befoer
and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks tothe the success of
" american pie
"
and
" there
' s something about mary
.
"
" mystery men
" drags on towards the end to a point where anything esle in the world is more entertaining
. anyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes isnt going to be successful at their talent in the end
and each one is going to contri
bute in a helpful way
. so why continue to watch
? this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure
.
" mystery men
" indeed does thsi annd every time a character succeeds another oen congratulates him
and says
" i knew you could dont it
!
"
" mystery men
" fails in every category it attempts to pass
. what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful
and unforgettable
. terrible acting
, terrible script
,
and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors
.
" i
' m unpredictable
!
" an overexcited ben stiller shouts out
. no ben
, you
' re the complete opposite
.
