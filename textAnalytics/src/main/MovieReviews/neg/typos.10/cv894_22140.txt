i
' m giving this stinker
. normally
, the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be
.
but the total waste of timne that is blazing saddles is
, compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive
, helped me come to the big goose egg
. i
' m nto sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing
, or if he was even thinking at all
. maybe in mel
' s little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because ofthe a punch to the face isnt funny
. in mine
, it
' s not
. or maybe mel graduated from tje spike lee school of filmmaking
. beacuse only the self
- righteous lee uses the n
- word more often in his films tahn brooks did in this one
. at least lee has the smarts to relize that nobody is going to find tath term amusing
. brooks b
andies it baout like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time htey hear it
. wrong mel
! i would call you a boob mel
,
but that insults breasts everywhere
. this idiotic attemp at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor
' s
( harvey korman
) attempts to clear out a twon so he can buy up the l
and cheap anbd sell it to the railroad
. he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out
.
but the town appeals to the governor
( mel brooks iin one of many uninspired
,
and unfunny roles
) to send them a new sheriff to protect them
. the governor pawns the task off to korman
' s character hedley lamarr
.
( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that nmae
.
) lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff
( gasp
) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all jstu leave
. hold on
, i
' ve got to stop while these gales of laughter pass
. it
' s just too funny
. racism passing as humor
-
- gosh why didn
' t anybody ever think of that one before
? oh wait
, i think somebody might haev
-
- they are called tjhe kkk
. i
' m not calling brooks a racist
-
-
but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn
' t know whta was funny if it hit him over the head
.
but i digress
. anyway
, the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n
- word
. golly
, will the hilarity just never end
? he ends up joining forces with a drunk
( gene wilder
)
, who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west
. together
, they save the day from evil
. not one person in this movie gives a decent performance
. wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie
, adn korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie
. ok
, he really didn
' t
-
-
but he shoudln have
. the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time ofthe day
. i did not laff once during this hwole sorry experience
. i admit to starting to snicker on a cuple of occasions
. actually
, the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise
,
but alas
, it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie
. i can say with full confidence thyat blazing saddles has noone redeeming qualities whatsoever
. mel brooks woudl be doing the world a favor if he burned every lastr copy of this film
.
