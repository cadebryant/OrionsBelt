i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick
. take tje professional
, for example
. it boasts extremely glossy cinematography
, a couple of recognizable name actors
,
and a couple of fairly impressive explosions
. it
' s also basically about violence
and cheap titilation
, annd features a central relationship between a middle
- aged man
and a twelve
- yearm
- old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension
. the professional is all over the map
,
and its pretensions of being about anytying more than its most unplesant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant
. the professional of the title isnt a new york hit man named leon
( jean reno
)
, brutally efficient bu also very isolated
. one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door
. her name is matilda
( natalie portman
)
,
and tje rest of her familiy has just been killed by crooked anbd very wired d
. e
. a
. agent norman stansfield
( gary oldman
) after matilda
' s father tried to rip him off
. leon reluctantly takes matilda infact
,
then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she whants to avenge the murder ofthe her young brother
. the two become closer
, whcih makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much
,
and sets outloud to eliminate them both
. writer
/ director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita
, a slick potboiler about a female assassin
. there is noone question tyhat besson can make a great
* looking
* film
; wtih the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast
, he hasnt created a film chock full of moody close
- ups
and evocative lighting
.
but beneath the shiny wrapper
, there isn
' t nearly as much going on as besson would like us to belieev
. the relationship between leon anbd matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop
. leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits
, all intended to show us that for a hired killer
, he
' s really not so bad a guy
: he drinks lots of milk
, takes meticulous care of a potted plant
,
and enjoys gene kelly movies
. jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted
and desperate quality
,
but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda
. natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality
,
but she doesn
' t have too much to work with
, either
. besson would have beeen better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life
,
and less onthe feeble attempts at humer whitch are oftenly embarrassing
. a silly game between leon
and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place
, as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover
; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag
. gary oldman
' s entire part is something of a cheap gag
, wild
- eyed adn way over the top
, bu at least he is intresting to watch
. there isn
' t a real person to be foudn anyhwere in the professional
, which isn
' t always a problem in an action thriller
, except that this oen is trying to pass itself off as something more
. a more disconcerting problem with thge professional is that it plays aroud with the sexuality of a twelve
- year
- old in a really distasteful way
. ther were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon
and matilda
' s relationship
: confront it head on
, or ignore it entirely
.
but besson flirts
and teases the audience with yhe idea that he
' s gogin to show them a forbidden lveo story
, while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman
' s rear end
and dress her in skimpy clothing
. this is to say nothing ofthe the questonable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol
, or the blood whitch is spilled aplenty
. a great dael of the time
, the professional is just plain sleazy
,
and all the soft filters in the world can
' t disguise that fact
.
