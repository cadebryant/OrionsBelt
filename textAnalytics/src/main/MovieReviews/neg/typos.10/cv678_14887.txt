who knew that in 16 years eddie murphy
, who made such a brash
, raucous big
- screen splash inwhich
_ 48
_ hrs
.
_
, would become
.
.
. cuddly
. the disconcerting trend begun in this summer
' s cutesy
, largly laff
- free
_ doctor
_ dolittle
_ continues with this earnest
- to
- a
- fault dramedy
.
al
though he is top
- billed
, here murphy is merely support forthe jeff goldblum
, who plays ricky hayman
, the programming director at a home shopping network
. sales are way down
,
and ricky
' s job hangs by a thread until he meets g
( murphy
)
, a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperte ricky puts on the air
. while sales skyrocket
and g becomes an overnight sensation
, the reinvigorated ricky
' s greed grows
, endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant
( kelly preston
)
. writer tom schulman has some promising ideas
, satirizing home shopping
and infomercials adn the nature of instant celebrity
.
but these ideas owudl have more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction ofthe the film
. the sluggishly paced
_ holy
_ man
_ is not only slow
and overlong
( 113 minutes
)
,
but an unfunny bore
,
and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings
; cleansed of both the attitude
_
and
_ comic sensibility that made him a star
( g is
, for the most part
, a straight man
)
, he is a curiously lifeless presence
. goldblum is actually quite good
, bu it
' s hard for the audience to sustain much intrest inaddition his character
and spiritual journy when the director doesn
' t seem to be much interseted
, either
.
