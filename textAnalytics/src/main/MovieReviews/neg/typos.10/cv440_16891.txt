the comet
- disaster flick is a disaster alright
. directed by tony scott
( top gun
)
, it tells the tsory about an asteriod the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth
. anbd you
thought that dinky little comet infront deep impact was trouble
. jeez
. after a great opening
, infront which an american spaceship
, plus the city of new york
, are completely destroyed by a comet shower
, nasa detects the said asteroid
and go into a frenzy
. they hire the world
' s best oil driller
( bruce willis
)
,
and send him
and his crew up into space to fix our globel probelm
. that
' s like sending a mouse into a cat carrier
, isn
' t it
? the action in armageddon are so over the top
, nonstop
,
and too ludicrous for words
, i had to sigh
and hit my head with my notebook a cuple of times
. i wass not alone
. plus
, to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of thte actor
' s talents
. the film is just a reel to show off a bunch ofthe snazzy fx shots
. the only rela reason for making this film was to somehow outloud
- perform deep inpact
. producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon
