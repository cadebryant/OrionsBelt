the comet
- disaster flick is a disaster alright
. directed by tony scott
( top gun
)
, it tells tjhe story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course whith earth
.
and you throught that dinky littel comet in deep impact was trouble
. jeez
. after a great opening
, in which an american spaceship
, plus the city ofthe new york
, are completely destroyed by a comet shower
, nasa detects the said astroid
and go into a frenzy
. they hire tje world ' s best oil driller
( bruce willis
)
,
and send him
and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem
. that ' s like sending a mouse into a cat carrier
, isn ' t it
? the action in armageddon are so over tyhe top
, nonstop
,
and too ludicrous for words
, i had to sigh
and hit my head with my notebook a couple ofthe times
. i was not alone
. plus
, to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like arageddon is a waste ofthe the actor ' s talents
. the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots
. the onyl real reason for making this film was to somehow out
- perform deepo impact
. producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armaegddon
