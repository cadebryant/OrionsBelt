i came to an epiphany while watching the bachler
, an innocuous
- enough
- on
- the
- surface romantic comedy
. it
' s not the sort of film infact which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity
,
but there it was nonetheless
. i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999
. in a word
, it
' s tje same thing that
' s wrong with so many movies circa 1999
: writing
. more tothe the point
, it
' s the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you
' re telling a story about a relationship
. teh bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we
' re expected tothe get dewy
- eyed over any pairing of attractive
, pleasant people just because they
' re attractive
and pleasant
. in this particular case
, attractive
and pleasent exhibit a is jimmy shannon
( chris o
' donnell
)
, a single guy who has been watching his firends slowly
but surely sucked into marriage
. it
' s a scary notion for jimmy
, even
though he dearly loves attractive
and pleasant exhibit b anne
( renee zellweger
)
, his girlfriend of three years
. convinced despite his reservations that it
' s tiem to
" sh
* t or get off the pot
,
" jimmy proposes to anne
-
- very badly
. anne refuses
, which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric gr
andfather
( peter ustinov
) dies
and leaves a very specific video will
. jimmy st
ands to inhereit
$ 100 million if he is married by 6
: 05 p
. m
. on his 30th birthday
, stays married for 10 years
and produces a child
. htere are onyl a couple of minor problems
: 1
) jimmy
' s 30th birthday is the next day
; 2
) anne is nowhere tothe be found
, meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex
- girlfriends
. it
' s a wacky
, brewster
' s millions
- esque premise
( acknowledged as such in one of the film
' s better
, more self
- aware lines ofthe dialogue
)
, the kind where a shallow anbd materialistic guy learns what really matters
. at least that would be the case if jimmy weren
' t already a world
- class altruist
. screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will
: if jimmy doesn
' t get married
, not only will he lose all the money
, bu the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him
, costing hudreds of jobs
. from the outset
, jimmy
' s motivation isn
' t cash
; it
' s the livelihoods of his devoted employees
. it
' s almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor
' s plot development
. by any human st
andard
, the guy is impossibly selfless
.
and that
' s the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor
-
- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness
. there
' s never any tension between the two star
- crossed lovers
, because there
' s no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake
. the bl
andly nice o
' donnell couldn
' t pull off a r
andy cad if he tryed
, so the filmmakers don
' t even let him
; zellweger
' s anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible st
andard to live up to
,
but no one dares make her anytying
but the woman
( lightly
) wronged
.
and forget baout seeing anough of jimmy
and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation
. tjhe parade of sit
- com set pieces had better be damned funny
, usance they
' re all that st
ands between us
and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion
. i
' ll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing
, including ustinov
' s rantings about procreation annd a restaurant full
- to
- bursting wtih men popping questions
and champagne corks
. far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly
, like the shudder
- inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune
- hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather inspite a church
. you
' re never going to get too many raucous belly laughs ffrom a film like the bachelor
,
but that
' s not the real probelm
. nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm
- n
- fuzzy conclusion it
' s leading uv to
. thge problem are a beginning
and middle that are equally warm
- n
- fuzzy
-
- there
' s no spark
, no energy
, no humanity
. it
' s an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer
' s digestions
. we
' ve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don
' t even have a pulse
. the bachelor is love amoung tje mannequins
.
