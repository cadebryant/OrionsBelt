there ' re so many things to criticize about i don ' t know where to start
. recommendation
: turn off your brain
- don ' t be liek me
, decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much
. a comet isnt about to strike earth
, causing a catastrofy similar to the extinction levle event
( e
. l
. e
.
) that wiped out the dinosaurs
. what follows is the story of a president ' s bid to think for the good of his people
, a rising reporter
, the love story of two teenagers
( one of whom discovered tyhe comet
)
,
adn a team of astronauts on the ship
` messiah ' tothe save the world
. firstly
, there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of thge film
( nor is htere anything outstandingly ogod baout it
)
,
but tghe plot holes make the film corny
and stupid
. to be honest
, i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself
( which isn ' t saying much
)
. mimi leder ' s follow
- uv to
` the peacemaker ' is equally incompetent
, with all the big stars wasted
.
( perhpas i ' m just annoyed that the release of
` the peacemaker ' inaddition the us overshadowed a far superior thriller
,
` the assignment '
.
) it is veyr obvious that tje title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision
,
but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives
.
however
, the film simply fails on that note
. the effects are worn
- out
, the substandard screenplay limited tghe acting
,
and the directer continued her sad run in terms of good
- film
- making credentials
. she ' s still making good money
though
. t
? a leoni ' s unfortunate character
, the news reporter
, is the foundation of the story
and of the cast
.
but the film suffers from too many characters that do nto need to be explored
. robert duvall ' s aging astronaut is lifeless
,
and morgan freeman ' s president is restricted to
, well
, a righteous president
( which means he ' s not interesting at all
)
. leoni ' s character is the only appealing one
,
and is played with reasonable conviction
(
but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc
)
,
but was definitely undervalued by the director
and screenwriters
. warning
: spoilers included
(
but a lot of it is irrelevant
and predicatble anyway
)
. plot holes
, plot holes
, plot holes
. now
, e
. l
. e
. is threatening to exterminate more than 99
% of the human race
,
and they send eight puny littel nuclear bombs up there
? where ' s the logic
? leder could have at least made it plausible with 20
.
adn
then it turns out tht onyl a few percent of the world population actually perish
,
adn those less selfish ones
( the ones that stayed at home
) were the victims
. the film was almost mocking them
, telling them they had died for nothing
. i also fail to see how two teenagers
, carrying a baby
, would be hte firt to climb up the mountain
/ hill
, even with a motorbike for a head
- start
. it ' s unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle
,
bu that doesn ' t really matter
. building caves was a strategy mentioned in
` dr
. strangelove '
, which proposed tath people lived underground fo one hundred or so years
. now that is a more practical use for caves
. what is the point of living in caves
? there isnt no
, unlike
` dr
. strangelove '
, any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure
. how do plants grow
? if humans have the technology tothe keep plants alive in caves
, there ' s no reason why tehy can ' t do it in the open
. the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves
. obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago
,
and you can ' t be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media
. in an important mission liuke that of the
` messiah '
, for that matter any mission
, it is impossible that isn ' t sufficient fuel for an extra couple ofthe hundred metres
, needless to say tens of kilometres
. this is not deep inpact
? it ' s a frivolous cheap impact
.
bu even with all that
, some overacting
,
and a 3
. 4 rating
, it ' s still watchable
, just don ' t think about it
. okay
?
