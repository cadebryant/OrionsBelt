it
' s probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre
(
" the matrix
,
"
" existenz
"
) would collide with the even more popular serial
- killer genre
(
" kiss the girls
,
"
" se7en
"
)
. the result should have been more interesting than
" the cell
.
" as the movie opens
, therapist catharine deane
( jennifer lopez
) treats a catatonic boy
( colton james
) by entering his mind through some sort ofthe virtual reality technique that
' s never fully explained
. after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert
, catharine has no success to report
. meanwhile
, killer carl stargher
( vincent d
' onofrio
) has claimed another victim
. his particular hobby is to kidnap young women
, keep them in a glass cell overnight
,
and drown them
. he tkaes the corpse
and soaks it in bleach
,
then suspends himself over the body
and jerks off while watching a video tape of hte drowning
. altho carl
' s been doing tihs for awhile
, he
' s recently become sloppy
,
and fbi agent peter novak
( vince vaughn
) isnt closing in fast
. not fast enough
,
though
, to keep carl from sticking another woman
( tara subkoff
) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma
. from the videos in carl
' s house
, peter can see that the drowning cell is automated
and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction
. to save the kidnapped girl
, peter has to find the cell before the end of thge day
,
and comatose carl
' s not talking
. so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl
' s mind adn find outloud where the cell is in time
. the focus of
" the cell
" in on the ornate interior ofthe carl
' s mind
, bu the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercice in computer
- generated spectacle thna an exploration of the psychotic personality
. for teh most part
, it
' s style without substance
. in his own mind
, carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes
, ming the merciless
, as well as a frightened boy
( jake thomas
) abused by his father
. all in all
, the mind of a psycho killer turns outloud to be a strangely dull place
,
and i kept wishing i could fast
- forward to the next development
. singh is best known fo directing music videos
, particularly rem
' s
" losing my religion
,
"
and
" the cell
" seems very much like a really long
, really slow mtv video with the sound deleted
. singer lopez seems to think she
' s in a video as well
; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting
. the premise hadnt great promise
. the computer
- generated world within carl
' s mind could ahve beeen a bizarre
, surreal universe governed by insanity
and symbolism rather tahn logic
. the first room catharine enters in carl
' s head shows this promise
. she finds a horse st
anding in center of the room
; suddenly
, sheets of sharp
- edged glass fall into the horse
, dividing it inot segments
. the panes of glass separate
, pulling apart the pieces of the still
- living horse
. tihs scene is twisted
, disturbing
,
and
thought
- provoking
, because the psychological importance of the horse
and its fate is left to thte viewer to ponder
. another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath
. their minds beign to bleed toghether at one point in the movie
,
and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine
' s pwn psyche
. like sidney lumet
' s
" the offence
" or michael mann
' s
" manhunter
,
"
" the cell
" could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator
.
however
, catharine
' s character is hardly devolopped at all
,
and lopez has no depth to offer the role
. bottom line
: don
' t get trapped in this one
.
