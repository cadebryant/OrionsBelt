well i guess it
' s that time ofthe the year again
. the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even
* try
* writing a script that has more dialogue tahn explosions
. it
' s also teh best time for the h
andful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies
, pull on their black vests
and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases
. in america they call this time
" summer
" anbd it happens once every year
.
and maybe it
' s the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it
,
but in yhe proccess normally weak
, insipid lines like
" consdider this a divorce
,
"
" hasta la vista
, baby
,
"
and
" you
' re the desease
. i
' m the cure
" actually do end up being repeated more often
then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs
. this is not entirely a bad thing
, of course
. what am i talking about
? i
' m talking about the summer
" blockbusters
,
" the
" action thrillers
,
" the
" htis
- obviously
- cost
- a
- lot
- so
- you
- know
- everyone
' s
- going
- to
- go
" explosions
, gas threats
, flying saucers
,
and special effects
. in tjhe rash of
" my
, what big guns you have
,
but wait
! mine are bigger
" movies
, ther are also the usual boy
- meets
- fish
-
and
- saves
- environment movies
( or whale
, whatever
)
,
and
* this
* year
, the odd crop of
" save
- the
- world
- from
- aliens
- or
- environment
- threats
" offerings
. i
' m talking about the three batmans
, the speeds
, the terminators
, etc
. this year i
' m talking about twister
, independence day
, the arrival
, the rock
, mission
: impossible
,
and of course
, eraser
. here infact singapore
, as our local movie critics like to whine
, we seem to get the pick ofthe yhe crop of
" my explosion is more real
- looking than yours
" movies
,
but nothing else
. mission
: impossible opened in our theatres allmost as soon as it did in the us
. the same goes for eraser
, which is unfortunate forthe arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon affter what time magasine recently called
" mission
: unavoidable
"
( on account of its worldwide mega
- advertising blitz
)
, eraser seems like a cheaper
, less
thoughtful imitation
. that
' s saying a lot
, because mi the movie was already a cheap
,
thoughtless imitation ofthe its tv originator of the
' 60s
/
' 70s
. in eraser
, arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger
. he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence
and re
- situating them with new identities
. his new case is lee cullen
, played by vanessa williams who
, unlike all the other scumbags he
' s ever relocated
, is
" an actual
, real life honest person
.
" because she
' s so good
,
and has such nice legs
, arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her
,
and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from
* his
* killers
. lee obtains evidence that the high
- technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated
, black
- market arms to people with foreign accents
and stringy hair
. ofthe course
, as the formula goes
, her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck
, there are people in high places who iwll go down with this
, because yes
, this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world
( that is
, america
) since watergate
. in protecting lee
, arnold is framed by tyhe mentor
- turned
- evil robert deguerin
, nicely played by james caan
,
and ends up having to prove that he isn
' t the one killing thte programme
' s witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn
' t accidetnally torpedo
- ed to death by the new
, green guns his enemies all have
. it
' s around tihs time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission
: impossible theme
, because arnie
' s mission includes breaking into a high
- security building tothe run a disk
. i guess i shouldnt tell you more baout the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about
. it
' s an electro
- magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles
,
and wich can see through walls
. it has some sort of x
- ray vision
, so its user can target the victim
' s heart even from great distances
. despite this
, which i figure is a pretty cool feature infact a gun
(
though i
' m certainly no expert
)
,
however
, arnold
, whose own heart is targeted a number ofthe times
,
* never
* goes flying 10 fezent backwards with a two
- foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun
. instead he outruns adn outsmarts his trackers each time
, giving eery
and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous
:
" i
' ll be bakc
.
" like everyone else in the theather
, i left teh movie feeling that the trailers had duped me
, because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily
.
al
though there is a
* lot
* of violence in htis movie
, not tothe mention mutilation
and some bloody tussles with alligators
, i reccomend this movie to most over
- 18s who ened some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas
