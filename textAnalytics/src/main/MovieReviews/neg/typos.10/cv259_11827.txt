" mercury rising
" has numerous flaws
,
but there is one that really st
ands out
: its central plot device is unnecessary
. that
' s right
. the major aspect of the film
, that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy
/ action flicks could be dropped from the beginning
,
and the movie owudl turn out exactly the same
, if not better
. thsi central device is the fact thgat a nine
- year
- old boy is autistic
. his name is simon
,
and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow
( alec baldwin
) wants him dead beccause he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped inot the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers jstu to see if someone could beat it
. simon is intended to be the heart
and soul of the film
,
and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor h
andicapped child thrown into a violent
, unfair world against his will
, with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him
. the fatc that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of
" mercury rising
.
" i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based doed much more wtih this aspect of simon
' s character
and his relationship with willis
,
but here it is lost
. miko hughes
, hte young actor who plays simon
, goes through the prescribed motions of bieng autistic
: he walks slowly
, drawls his words
, kicks
and screams when he
' s touched
,
and has a hard time looking at otehr people
. it
' s a difficult role for an adult
, much less a young child
, to play
, annd unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn
' t playing like he
' s autistic
. unlike dustin hoffman
' s performance inthe
" rain man
" or leonardo dicaprio
' s in
" what
' s eating gilbert grape
,
" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting
.
however
, unlike
" rain man
" whihc used its character
' s autism in unique
and interesting ways to build a credible
and touching story
,
" mercury rising
" could go right about its generic
, predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart
but really shy kid
. hell
, he doesn
' t even have to be shy
. in fatc
, the movie might have been more intresting if he had had a omre active role
, rather than just being carted around under willis
' arm
. willis
' character
, art jeffries
, is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work anbd isnt now doing menial tasks like listening tothe wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything
. he becomes involved with simon when he isnt called to check out a murder scene at simon
' s house
, where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back
and
then committed suicide
. of course
, we know that isn
' t the way it happened happen because we saw an evil
, square
- jawed government hitman with a mean
- looking crew
- cut knock off the parents
. simon was able to get away
,
and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet
, which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked
. jeffries
-
- who isnt accused by several charactors at different times of being paranoid
al
though his actions never suggest it
-
- knows there is something more
, annd he makes it his personal mission to go against everything
and everyone in order to protect simon
. this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon
' s parents is crawling everywhere
, attempting to kill simon at the hospital
, onthe the highway
,
and every other place he goes
. late in the movie
, jeffries is forced tothe enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey
( kim dickens
) who he meets at a coffee shop
. of all tghe hard
- tothe
- believe aspects of the movie
, this is the worst
. i cxan believe in the decency of teh human heart
,
but stacey
' s character is far too accommodating
. not only doens she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mistery
, she lets him into her apartment at two o
' clock inwhich the morning when she knows the police is after him
,
and
then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed tothe pay the rent
. the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at thsi point
. tje movie might have been redeemed by smoe ogod action sequences
,
but even here
" mercury rising
" doesn
' t rise to the challenge
. the movie was directed by harold becker
, who has made some good suspense films including
" sea of love
"
( 1989
)
and
" malice
"
( 1993
)
,
but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion
. there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries
and another hitman
( played by peter stormare
) that is so ineptly directed
, shot
and edited
, that i had no idea 1
) exactly where they weere on tghe streetcar
, 2
) who was hitting who
,
and 3
) where this hitman came from anbd how he knew where jeffries
and simon weere
. the gr
and finale takes place on tje roof of a tall buiding
,
and features a harrowing
( yawn
) scene where simon walks along tyhe very edge of the building
, not because he has tothe
,
but because it
' s more suspenseful that way
. taken as a whole
,
" mercury rising
" is an tepid
, confused movie that lacks style
, witn
, annd any traces of a sense of humer
. usually willis brings his personal br
and of understated humor to his roles
,
but here he is too straight
and serious
. this is becouse the movei wants to be an action flick
and a heartfelt drama at the same time
,
but it ends up failing on both fronts
. maybe the book was better
,
but the way it
' s h
andled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore
.
