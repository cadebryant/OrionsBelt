" mercury rising
" has numerous flaws
,
bu there isnt one that really stands out
: its central plot device is unnecessary
. that ' s right
. tje major aspect ofthe the film
, that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy
/ action flicks could be dropped from the beginning
,
and the movie would turn out exactly the same
, if nto better
. this central divice is the fact that a nine
- eyar
- old boy is autistic
. his nmae is simon
,
annd an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow
( alec baldwin
) wants him dead baceause he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the bakc of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just tothe see if someone could beat it
. simon is intended to be the heart
and soul of the film
,
adn we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent
, unfair world against his will
, with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him
. the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities ofthe
" mercury rising
.
" i supose the original novel apon which the movei was based did much more with this aspect of simon ' s character
and his relationship witht willis
,
but here it is lost
. miko hughes
, teh young actor who plays simon
, goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic
: he walks slowly
, drawls his words
, kicks
and screams when he ' s touched
,
and has a hard time looking at other peple
. it ' s a difficult role for an adult
, much less a young child
, to play
,
and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn ' t playing like he ' s autistic
. unlike dustin hoffman ' s performance in
" rain man
" or leonardo dicaprio ' s in
" what ' s eating gilbert grape
,
" we are always painfully aware that hughes isnt acting
.
however
, unlike
" rain man
" which used its character ' s autism in unique
and interesting ways to build a credible
anbd touching story
,
" mercury rising
" could go right about its generic
, predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart
but really shy kid
. hell
, he doesn ' t even have to be shy
. in fact
, the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role
, rather than just being carted arund under willis ' arm
. willis ' character
, art jeffries
, is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work
and is now donig menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything
. he becomes involved with simon when he is called tothe check out a murder scene at simon ' s house
, where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back
and
then committed suicide
. of course
, we knwo that isn ' t tyhe way it happened happen because we saw an evil
, square
- jawed government hitman with a mean
- looking crew
- cut knock off thge parents
. simon was able to get awya
,
and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet
, which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked
. jeffries
-
- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid
although his actions never suggest it
-
- knows there is something more
,
adn he makes it his personal mission to go against everything
and everyone infact order to protect simon
. this is quite a task becuase that same hitman who knocked off simon ' s parents is crawling everywhere
, attempting to kill simon at the hospital
, on the highway
,
and every other place he goes
. late in tjhe movie
, jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey
( kim dickens
) who he meets at a coffee shop
. of all the hard
- to
- believe aspects of the movei
, this is the worst
. i can believe in the decency of the human heart
,
but stacey ' s character is far too accommodating
. not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery
, she lets him into her apartment at two o ' clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him
,
and
then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed tothe pay the rent
. the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point
. tjhe movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences
,
but even here
" mercury rising
" doesn ' t rise to the challenge
. thte movie was directed by harold becker
, who has made some good suspense films includng
" sea of love
"
( 1989
)
and
" malice
"
( 1993
)
,
bu his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion
. there is one fight onthe a streetcar between jeffries
annd another hitman
( played by peter stormare
) that is so ineptly directed
, shot
and edited
, that i had no idea 1
) exactly where they were on the streetcar
, 2
) who was hitting who
,
and 3
) where this hitman came ffrom
and how he knew where jeffries
and simon were
. the grand finale takes palce on tje roof of a tall buidling
,
and features a harrowing
( yawn
) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building
, not because he has to
,
but because it ' s more suspenseful that way
. taken as a whole
,
" mercury rising
" is an tepid
, confused movie thast lacks style
, witn
,
and any traces of a sence of humor
. usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles
,
but here he is too straight
and serious
. this is because the movei wants to be an action flick
and a heartfelt drama at the same time
,
but it ends up failing on both fronts
. maybe the book was better
,
but the way it ' s handled here is a perfect case studdy in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore
.
