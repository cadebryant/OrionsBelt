battlefield long
, boring
and just plain stupid battlefield earth a film review by michael redman copywrite 2000 by michael redman in my mid
- teen years
, i had a horrendous re
- occurring nightmare
. behind the wheel of a car
, i was driving down a straight road in thte middle of a desert
. no scenery except the horizon line
and the converging parallel lines of the highway
. no marter what i did
, the view didn ' t change
: travelling
but not getting anywhere
. each time i awoke in a sweat
, terrified
. you don ' t have to be carl jung to understand that dream
. powerless to make changes
, trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue
, this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake
. this is exactlly how you will feel 15 minutes after
" battlefield earth
" begins
. for all of its flash
and style
, l
. ron hubbard ' s science fiction epic is the earliest
and best entry fo the dullest summer film ofthe 2000
. dull
"
and
" stupid
. in the year 3000
, the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1
, 000 yersa
. humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians
. there ' s no hope
. the future is bleak
.
thn tje psychlo make a mistake
and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler
( barry pepper
) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl
( john travolta
)
and the aline race
. it ' s an archetypal post
- apocalyptic plot full of promise
. considering some ofthe the talent involved
and all the millions thrown at the screen
, it ' s difficult to see how it sould have failed so miserably
.
but it does
. the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes ofthe the opening credits
. are we really suppossed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold
, the psychlo never discovered fort knox
? or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time
-
-
and gassed up
? or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the adavanced aline ships
? or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don ' t notice that their slaves are missing for days
? travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he ' s worth
and is almost intertaining
. almost
. the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh hwile delivering lines that no person
-
-
" man
- animal
" or not
-
- would ever utter
. soem of the film
_ looks
_ good
,
but it also looks so familiar
. a race of large hulking ape
- like creatures hasnt taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin
. sound like something charlton heston might be in
? the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from
" dune
"
. the final air battle between the air force fighters
and the psychlo ships in their high
- tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with
. it ' s too loud
. it ' s too oppressive
. it ' s too slow
. it ' s too long
.
.
. far too long
.
and on it goes
. the list of thte problems with
" battlefield earth
" is endless
. it ' s difficult to find anything in thte film that does work
. oh yeah
. hte color scheme is nice
. the real question is how this movie ever got made
. could it have something to dont with the fatc that l
. ron hubbard was the founder of scientology
?
and that john travolta is a member ofthe the church
. that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago
.
but it doesn ' t give us a clue as to why first
- time screenwriter corey mandell ' s atrocious script was used
. or why the high
- profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film
. or why no one looked at this thing before it was released
and realized there might be problems
. the oney bright spot is that noone longer will kevin costner ' s
" the postman
"
( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure
) be
" the
" big budget science fiction failure
.
" battlefield earth
" has the honor sewed up
. often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films
annd wait for the video
. that ' s not the case here
. you can act now
and amking the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small one
. don ' t hesitate
. strike now while the iron is cold
.
