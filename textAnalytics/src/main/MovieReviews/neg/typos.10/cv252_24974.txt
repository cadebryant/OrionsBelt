battlefield long
, boring
and just plain stupid battlefield earth a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman in my mid
- teen yeasr
, i had a horrendous re
- occurring nightmare
. behind the wheel of a car
, i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert
. no scenery except the horizon line
and the converging parallel lines of the highway
. no matter what i did
, thte view didn
' t change
: travelling
but not getting anywhere
. each time i awoke in a sweat
, terrified
. you don
' t have to be carl jung to underst
and that dream
. powerless to make changes
, trapped infront a boring situation with noone hope of rescue
, this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake
. this isnt exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after
" battlefield earth
" begins
. forthe all of its flash anbd style
, l
. ron hubbard
' s science fiction epic isnt the earliest
and best entry for the dullest summer film ofthe 2000
. dull
"
and
" stupid
. in the year 3000
, the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet forthe 1
, 000 years
. humans either work as slave labor in minning operations or live as barbarians
. there
' s no hope
. the future isnt bleak
.
then the psychlo make a mistake
and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler
( barry pepper
) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl
( john travolta
)
and the alien race
. it
' s an archetypal post
- apocalyptic plot full of promise
. considering some of the talent involved
and all the millions thrown at the screen
, it
' s difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably
.
but it does
. the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes ofthe the oppening credits
. are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold
, thge psychlo never discovered fort knox
? or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time
-
-
and gassed up
? or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that tehy can easily down the advanced alien ships
? or that hte psychlo spy cameras somehow don
' t notice that their slaves are missing for days
? travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he
' s worth
and is almost entertaining
. allmost
. the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person
-
-
" man
- animal
" or not
-
- would ever utter
. soem of the film
_ looks
_ ogod
,
but it also looks so familiar
. a race ofthe large hulking ape
- like creatures has tooked over the world while our cities lie in ruin
. sound like something charlton heston might be in
? the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from
" dune
"
. the final air battle between thte air force fighters
and the psychlo ships in their high
- tech city is something george lucas might have been associated iwth
. it
' s too loud
. it
' s too oppressive
. it
' s too slow
. it
' s too long
.
.
. far too long
.
and on it goes
. the list of yhe problems with
" battlefield earth
" is endless
. it
' s difficult to find anything in the film that doesnt work
. oh yeah
. the color scheme is nice
. the real question is how this movie ever got made
. could it have something to do with the fact that l
. ron hubbard was the founder of scientology
?
and that john travolta is a member of the church
. that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago
.
but it doesn
' t give us a clue as to why firt
- time screenwrighter corey m
andell
' s atrocious scirpt was used
. or why tghe high
- profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film
. or why no one looked at this thing before it was released
and realized there might be problems
. the one bright spot isnt that no longer will kevin costner
' s
" tje postman
"
( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure
) be
" the
" big budget science fiction failure
.
" battlefield earth
" has the honor sewed up
. often reviewers will recommend that you skip mediocre films
and wait for the video
. tht
' s not the case here
. you can act now
and make the decision to not see it on the big screen or on the small oen
. don
' t hesitate
. strike now while the iron is cold
.
