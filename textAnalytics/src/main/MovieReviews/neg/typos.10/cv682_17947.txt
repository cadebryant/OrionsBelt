often similar to a little boy lost in a park thyat he had no right venturing into
, the call of the oboe
( o toque do oboe
) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray
. many elements of the film are solid
,
and have potential far greater tahn directer claudio macdowell will ever know
,
but they simply don ' t convert inot a solid work
.
although a setting is never established
, it becomes apparent
. the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day
. the community is a dull one
, where eveyr day is a downhill slide from the last
. over time
, the people have taken to themselves
. the town cinema is closed
, no tourist has pasted through in years
,
and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger
. so what happens when a
" tourist
"
( paolo betti
) does arrive one day
? he sends this routine
annd dull town into mayhem
and shock
. it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby
. when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance
, tyhe entire community gathers around for theri first bit of entertainment in countless years
. it is from that that the musician meets some ofthe the villagers
,
and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment tothe a silent film
, thus oppening the theatre for the first time in ages
. the woman thta talks him inot this witty task is the cinema owner
( leticia vota
) who also happens to be engaged to the town ' s police inspector
, a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance ' s involvement with this musician
. the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak sohw gone horribly astray
. it features a character who literally rises ffrom his grave
, a woman who has a phone conversation with god
,
and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing
and serious charater
, to an almost humorous drunk
. technically
, this film is a nightmare
. the music score is poorly edited into the film
, so it is often choppy
, rough
,
and abrupt
. the lighting is poor at best
, which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes
,
and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words
,
and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand soem simple portuguese
and spanish phrases
. this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue
,
but the subtitles are limited to fewer thna 25 words
. in addition
, the pace of the film seems uneven
. it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one ' s patience
. the film
then moves into a faster pace
, that again slows towards the end
, as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark
. there was
,
however
, potential for this film
. it is a piece exploring the beauty ofthe cinema
and music
,
and the re
- unification of people
. these are all topics that could easily fill a movie
. perhaps
, if ther were no freak show
,
and the technical aspects were to improve
, there might just be a hting of beauty at the end
. most importantly
,
though
, the director would have to patch up the plot
and make it flow better so that the two hours aren ' t such a bore
. until
then
, there seems tothe be little more hope for this piece
, than that boy has by simply crying out
" mommy
" while he wanders astray in a park
.
