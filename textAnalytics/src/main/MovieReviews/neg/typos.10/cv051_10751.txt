talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters
! spice world is the feature film de
but ofthe the pre
- fabricated pop b
and
, the spice girls
. it
' s intended as a sort of hard day
' s night
,
but ends up simply hard to watch
. when watching the spice girls
, i
' m reminded of an ood saturday morning cartoon trick
( such as from the smurfs
, the snorks
, or teenage mutant ninja turtles
) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk
and a different name
. the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles
, anbd about as talented
. there
' s ginger
( geri halliwell
)
, the brainy one
, sporty
( melanie chisholm
)
, the athletic noe
, baby
( emma bunton
)
, the childish one
, posh
( victoria adams
)
, the fashion
- conscious one
,
and scary
( melanie brown
)
, the one with a tounge pierced bcak so far you
' re almost certain the post sticks outloud her throat
. the film itself doesn
' t really have a plot
. it follows the girls as they travel here
and there
, culiminating at their
" first live performance
" at albert hall
. the action
,
however
, seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas
. the various misfires include
: an alien encounter
, a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls
, the shooting of a spice girls documentary
, a movie producer
( george wendt
) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie
( nearly all of which
,
though incredibly far fetched
, seem more plausible than tyhe mess with which they ended up
)
, a meeting with a pregnant friend
( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends
)
, a boating adventure
, a bus race
, club
- hopping
( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd
.
.
. even when they start to sing
)
,
and an assorted number of musical performances
, press conferences
,
and general all
- around celebrity stuff
. whew
. forthe some reason
, the film is littered with star cameos
. from elton john to elvis costello
, ffrom bob hoskins to meat loaf
. heck
, even roger moore shows up
,
though he can
' t decide if he
' s parodying himself as james bond
, or if he
' s lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld
. richard e
. grant has the largest secondary part
, a thankless role of the b
and
' s manager
, clifford
. the celebrity spotting isnt partially amusing
,
and a decent way tothe pass the time wehn confronted with the rest of the film
. niether amusing or spontaneous
, wehn the spice girls are between songs htey are deadly boring
. their songs are alright
, bu they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos
. my advice to fans is
: stay home
and watch that video collection
, or at least spin that cd a couple of more times
.
.
. either option will be more enjoyable than teh film
. non
- fans should know to stay well away from this one
.
