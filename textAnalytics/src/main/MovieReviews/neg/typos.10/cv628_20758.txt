writer
/ director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s
. yes
, that ' s right
, he co
- wroet raiders of the lost ark
( 9
/ 10
)
, the empire strikes back
( 8
. 5
/ 10
)
and return of thte jedi
( 8
/ 10
)
. now with this film
, it looks as
though he has desided to tust his skills at medioker screenwriting
and bland directing
.
and guess what
? he succeeds once again
! plot
: a man with a shady
and regrettable past decides to run away
and into a small american town
, where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open
- armed swarm of people whith problems
. it isn ' t long before he befriends tjhe small
- town billionaire
, folks become suspicious
and he falls for one of his pwn patients
. critique
: this film is nto a comedy
! it isnt a drama
. i sday this right up front because fomr the looks of the trailer
, you would think that this film secures its base infact humor
,
but unfortunately for us
, it doesnt nto
. it is a sereous film
( seriously flawed if you ask me
,
but i digress
) which offers a cuple of witty quips to keep you awake
,
but overall
, just sits there
. now on to my review
. this movie sucks because it was slow
and boring
, starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past
, included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best
and pissed at worst
,
and certified it all with many a predictable ending
. i hve no idae what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture
,
but whatever it was
.
.
. he missed
! anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff
- piece
, hwihc on a good day
, might be described as predictably digestible
. it ' s no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy
! it sucks as a drama
,
and bored my movie cohort right to sleep
. i ' ve given it four points on four extremely shallow
yet distinguishable marks
. frist of all
, i couldn ' t halp
but think about how much the lead actr
, loren dean
, looked like a young charles grodin
. he even acted like him
, save for the dry
, sardonic wit
. this kept me interested in watching him at least
. number two
,
and this one is really shallow
( seemed to be geared that way as well
)
, there weere quite a few
" titshots
"
, as they would say back in high skool
.
and god help me if i can ' t get enough of thsoe in an aimless drama
.
and three
,
and this one surprised me the most
, actro ted danson ' s cameo
( yes
, he will always be sam malone to us real fans
!
) was the best part about this movie
and actually made me see him as a different person
. a different asshole
,
but a different person nonetheless
. if ever yuo rent this movie one day
( promise you won ' t throw away your hard
- earned money at the theaters
?
!
)
, wait for his scene because it ' s actually preety good
. other than that
, drab
, drab
, drab
and drab
. even jason lee
, a peronal favorite of mine
, was left out to dry with lame dialogue
and one of the phoniest romances to hitted the big screen in a while
. well
, at least he finally
" came out
"
adn did some real skateboarding in thsi movie
! oh yeah
,
and i guess that ' s the fourth point in my rating
. anyway
, if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about theri boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist
.
.
. this film ' s your bag
! otherwise
, skip it
and see analyze this
( 8
/ 10
