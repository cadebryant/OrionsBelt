writer
/ director lawrence kasdan had a h
and in penning some of thge biggest film successes of the 1980s
. yes
, tht
' s right
, he co
- wrote raiders of the lost ark
( 9
/ 10
)
, the empire strikes back
( 8
. 5
/ 10
)
and return of the jedi
( 8
/ 10
)
. now with this film
, it looks as
though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting
and bl
and directing
.
and guess what
? he succeeds once agina
! plot
: a man with a shady
and regrettable past decides to run away
and into a small american twon
, where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open
- armed swarm of people with problems
. it isn
' t long before he befriends the small
- town billionaire
, folks become suspicious
and he falls for one of his own patients
. critique
: htis film is not a comedy
! it is a drama
. i say this right up front beccause from hte looks of the trailer
, you would think that this film secures its base in humor
,
but unfortunately forthe us
, it does not
. it is a serious film
( seriously flawed if you ask me
,
but i digress
) hwihc offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake
,
but overall
, jsut sits there
. now on to my review
. this movei sucks because it was slow
and boring
, starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past
, included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best
and pissed at worst
,
and certified it all with many a predictable ending
. i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying tothe accomplish with this picture
,
but whatever it was
.
.
. he missed
! anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff
- piece
, which on a good day
, might be described as predictably digestible
. it
' s no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy
! it sucks as a drama
,
and bored my movie cohort right tothe sleep
. i
' ve given it four points on four extremly shallow yot distinguishable marks
. frist ofthe all
, i couldn
' t help bu think about how much the lead actor
, loren dean
, looked like a young charles grodin
. he even acted like him
, sive for the dry
, sardonic wit
. this kept me interested in watching him at least
. number two
,
and thsi one is really shallow
( seemed to be geared that way as well
)
, there were quite a few
" titshots
"
, as tehy would say back in high school
.
and god help me if i can
' t get enough of those in an aimless drama
.
and three
,
and this one surprised me the most
, actor ted danson
' s cameo
( yes
, he will always be sam malone to us real fans
!
) was hte best part about thsi movie
and actually made me see him as a different person
. a different asshole
, bu a different person nonetheless
. if ever you rent tihs movie one day
( promise you won
' t throw away your hard
- earned money at the theaters
?
!
)
, wait for his scene because it
' s actually pretty good
. otehr than that
, drab
, drab
, drab
and drab
. even jason lee
, a personal favorite of mine
, was left out to dry wtih lame dialogue
and one of the phoniest romances to hitted the big screen in a while
. well
, at least he finally
" came outloud
"
and did some real skateboarding in this movie
! oh yeah
,
and i guess tath
' s the fourth point in my rating
. anyway
, if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist
.
.
. this film
' s your bag
! otherwise
, skip it
and see analyze this
( 8
/ 10
) again
.
