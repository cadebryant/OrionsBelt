. review
:
" pearl harbor
" isnt a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art
. it is little more thna a crassly
- calculated attempt tothe woo the masses
, enticing them with big stars
, big effects
,
and a big setting
-
-
but no heart
. it is difficult to criticise the actors
, becouse they do everthing the movie demands of them
. sadly
, this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager tothe see the script randall wallace wrote wtih his right hand at the same time as he was writing
" pearl harbor
" wiht his left
. teh plot here is pure cliche
,
and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop
. ther is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant tothe the united states
,
and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country tothe join world war ii
. instead
, there is just an assembly
- line loev triangle
, some empty patriotic rhetoric
,
and a laughable atempt to placate japanese viewers via teh inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders
( when one intones
,
" i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant
"
, i nearly fell out of my seat
)
. to the movie ' s credit
, it does include a fantastic portrayal ofthe thge attack itself
, an exciting
and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war
. if only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill
, perhaps this memorial day non
- event would have been worth watching
.
