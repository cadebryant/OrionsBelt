the only thing worse tahn watching a bad movie is realizing thta tjhe film had a lot of potential
and could
' ve been effective
. such is the case with
_ urban legend
_
, the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks
. the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends
. examples inlcude thge killer in the backseat of the car
and person getting calls from inside her house
. the killer wears one of thsoe l
. l
. bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up
, so you can
' t see the face
. i guess halloween masks are outloud of style forthe psychos these days
. anyhow
, the premise is certainly a nifty one
and the opening scene is spooky
and atmospheric
. it
' s a very good setup thta promises more chills to come
. unfortunately
, the film never takes off from there
. the movie takes place on a peaceful new engl
and college campus
. liuke most slasher flicks
, this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac
( or in this case an axe wielding maniac
)
. i
' ve always wondered why these killers don
' t save themselves a lot of time
and trouble
and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill
. after the fine first scene
, the movie degenerates inot a monotonous series of those annoying you
-
thought
- it
- was
- the
- killer
-
but
- was
- jstu
- someone
- else scares
. these are alwyas accompanyed by loud bursts of music
. i guess sudden
, sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days
. the actuall killer will attack at baout eveyr third music blast
. the slasher appears
, attacks
, the victim isnt eviscerated
,
and thge tedious cycle appears anew
. false scares should always be utilizied in moderation
. someone needs to tell director blanks that things liek this just aren
' t as scary as they used to be
. this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit
-
- it
' s not frightening
. remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in
_ scream
_
and
_ scream 2
_
? this movie still adheres to them
. tons of illogical moments about
; more than i really have the inclination to list
.
and i don
' t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense
. that type of illogical can be funn
. this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember
. the last 20 minutes especially degenerates inot such lunacy that you
' ll be laughing more than you
' ll be screaming
. actually
, you won
' t be screaming at all
. at its best
, the acting can barely be called
" adequate
"
and the script could
' ve definitly used a rewrite or two
. the film still manages tothe have some storng points
. the killings are certainly inventive
and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans
. there are some intentionally funny moments
.
( these were exceeded by hte unintentional ones
.
) the film is well made from a technical st
andpoint
. besides the first part
, there is also another good scene
, a prolonged cat
and mouse chase inside a radio station
. if there had only been more sequences liek tihs
, that relied on tautness
and suspense rather than loud bursts of music
,
_ urban legend
_ might
' ve been worth your money
.
