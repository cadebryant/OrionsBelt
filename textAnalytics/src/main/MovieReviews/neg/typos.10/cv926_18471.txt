. atcheson a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review
. i
' ve attemted to obey thsi rule in recent months
,
but to do so would be impossible in this case
. the fact is
, nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them
. the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people
. for me
, tehy calibrated my creativity as a child
; they are masterful
, original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time
(
and they still hold up pretty darn well
)
. i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release
,
but tyhat doesn
' t make me any less dedicated to it
. on the contrary
, the star wars trilogy
-
-
and the empire strikes back in particular
-
- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies
. when i herad that george lucas woudl be making the first trilogy inwhich the nine
- film series
, i got exited
. when i first saw screenshots from thte film
, well over a year ago
, i embarked on a year
- long drool of anticipation
.
and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving
, i wass ready to see the film
.
but hten there was the hype
, the insane marketing campain
,
and lucasfilm
' s secretive snobbery over the picture
. in the last weeks before the picture opened
, while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters
and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones infact the theater
, i ws tired of hearing about it
. i was tired of seeing cardboard cut
- outs ofthe the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell
. i just wnated to see tjhe movie
. reader
, do not misunderst
and
. i did not have an anti
- hype reaction
. the hype was unavoidable
. i underst
and
and accept the hype
-
- it
' s just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released
. five minutes into the phantom menace
, i knew there ws a probelm
.
" who are these jedi knights
?
" i asked
.
" why are they churning outloud stale dialogue with machine
- gun rapidity
?
"
" why aren
' t these characters being developed before their adventures
?
"
" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film
?
" these were jstu some of my questions early on
. later
, i asked
,
" where
' s the magic of the first three films
?
"
and
" why am i looking at my watch eveyr fifteen minutes
?
' by the end of teh film
, i was tired
, maddened
,
and depressed
. george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless
, mindless
, summer blockbuster
. the phantom menace is no star wars film
. take away the title
and the jedi talk
and the force
,
and you
' re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous speshal effects movies ofthe all time
. it
' s an embarrassment
. i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored
, or a new theme is examined
, or a special effects shot isn
' t used
. there are a few of each
,
but they
' re all token attempts
. the fact is
, george lucas has creaeted what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie
and a pretty good showcase for digital effects
. this is not what i wanted to see
. i didn
' t want tothe leave the phantom menace with a headache
and a bitter taste in my mouth
,
but i did
. the story centers mostly around qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
, looking lost adn confused
)
and his apprentice
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
, who scarcely hasnt a line in the film
)
and their attempts to liberate the people ofthe the planet naboo
. naboo is hte victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation
; their contact on naboo isnt queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
, the teenage ruler who truley cares for her people
. after picking up jar jar binks
( a completely cgi carachter
, voiced by ahmed best
)
, they head to tatooine
, where they meet young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
and his mother
( pernilla august
)
. qui
- gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin
,
and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys
. the bad guys are darth maul adn darth sidious
, neither of whom have anough lines to register as characters
. there isn
' t anything particularly wrong witht this tsory when looking at it in synopsis form
. the way lucas has h
andled it
,
however
, it unsatisfactory
. first of all
, we don
' t learn one single thing about qui
- gon jinn
. not one thing
. what was his life like before tihs film
? well
, i imagin he didn
' t have one
. that
' s why he feels like a plot device
. tihs probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role
,
and why he
' s recently retired from film
( i don
' t blame him
, honestly
)
. obi
- wan
, a character i was realyl looking forward tothe learning more about
, is even less interesting
. mcgregor has just a few lines
, so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged tothe look elsewhere
. since these two men are tje focus of the phantom menace
, lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie
. things start tothe pick up when our characters reach tatooine
; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed
- out character in the film
,
and lloyd doesnt a
thoughtful job with the role
. i was also hugely impressed with the s
and speeder scene
; rarely is an action sequence so fast
and so exciting
.
and when anakin says goodbye to his mother
, i found it moving
. also fairly good is portman
,
and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has beeen written
. jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i
' ve ever had to endure
,
but he
' s more interesting than most of the humans
. as soon as the relatively
- brief segment on tatooine is over
, it
' s back to the mind
- numbing special effects
and depthless action scenes
. i
' ve seen many movies that qualify as
" special effects extravaganzas
,
"
but the phantom menace is hte first one i
' ve seen that had me sick ofthe the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie
. the reason is obvious
: george lucas has no restraint
. i can
' t sday that i didn
' t fidn the effects original
, because i did
-
- the final battle between darth maul
, obi
- wan
,
and qui
- gon is visually exceptional
, as is most of tje film
.
but i also found the effects deadening
and tiresome
. my breaking point was near the end of the picture
, as anakin is getting questioned by yoda
and the other jedi masters
; in the background
, we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky
,
and i wanted that to go away
. can
' t we have one stinking scene that isn
' t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot
? i got so sick ofthe looking at the cgi characters
and spaceships
and planets
and backgrounds that i relaly just wanted to go outside
and look at a physical l
andscape fo a few hours
.
and
then there
' s the question of magic
. what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace
and return of the jedi
? i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel
. john williams
' familiar score is no help
, nor is lucas
' direction
. i think it comes right down to characters
: there are none here
. i longed for the magnetic presence ofthe han
, luke
,
and leia
,
but i got no such thing
.
and what about the ridiculous expectations
? mine weren
' t taht high
; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving
, a story that had a few characters
and a few great special effects
. instead
, i got two hours
and fifteen mintues of a lifeless
and imaginative computer graphics show
. i don
' t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it
: i
' d like to forget that it exists
,
and
yet i can
' t
. it
' s here to stay
. i can only hope that episodes ii
and iii have something of substance iin them
, because if they don
' t
,
then lucas iwll hve pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series
.
