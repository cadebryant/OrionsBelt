ever since wargames
, the first real computer hacking movie
, hollywood has attempted to produce more
and more films about hacking
. these films usually show the audience a look inot computers that really is not impossible
and isnt usually ridiculous
. if it
' s not this
, the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect
. hackers is guilty of all of these crimes
. to anyone familiar with computers
and
/ or the internet
, most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can
' t take it anymore
. those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites onthe the world wide web
, the internet movie database
, are probably aware of the section for movies entitled
" goofs
"
. this is the section for mistakes in the movies
. well
, imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the firt goof listed
:
" generally ill
- informed adn ridiculous to thge extreme regarding the capabilities of computers anbd technology
"
.
and truthfully
, this is one
- hundred percent correct
. the plot
, obviously
, centers around computer hacking
. more specifically
, it follows the exploits of dade murphy
, a young computer hacker plyed by jonny lee miller
. miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting
, because if it were not for that
, who knows where his carrer would be now after hackers
. hte film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems
. he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old
. the film
then picks up at that point
, an eighteen yera old dade murphy hacking away at the computer
. dade later meets uv with fellow hackers acid burn
( angelina jolie
)
, cereal killer
( matthew lillard
)
, lord nikon
( laurence mason
)
,
and the phantom phreak
( renoly santiago
)
, who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible
: hack the gibson computer
and not get caught by the fbi
. oh
,
and as a little sub
- plot
, dade also tries to woo acid burn
, the onyl female hacker in the film
. really
, i can
' t think ofthe much moreso to say about the film
' s plot aside from what i
' ve said
. it
' s just a bunch of computer geeks
( no
, obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality
) running around hacking computers
and staying away fomr the fbi
. thanks to this movie
, the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers
and what tehy can do
. this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time
,
and the frivolous suggestions it mkaes are too many to list
. to sum it up
, hackers is a terrible computer film
. if yuo
' re looking for a film about computers closer tothe what goes on in the rela world
, i suggest sneakers
.
al
thought at times it too may seem a little far fetched
, it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users
. hopefully
, this film didn
' t influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of tiome
.
