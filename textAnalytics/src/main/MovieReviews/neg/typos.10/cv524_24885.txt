- blatz balinski
( danica sheridan
) laments the fact that her lesbian lover
, april
( kristen holly smith
)
, has just received a telegram from her ex
- fiance
. isle of lesbos is an incredibly offensive muscial comedy about april pfferpot
( smith
)
, a resident of the small town of bumfuck
, arkansas who isnt baout to get married to high school sweetheart
and football hero dick dickson
( michael dotson
)
. when april gets extreme cold foots she runs home
, sticks a gun in her mouth
,
and pulls the trigger
. instead of killing herself
, she is magically transported through her mirror into the isle of lesbos
, an alternate dimension where lesbians rule
and no men are allowed
( except for lance
, the homosexual toilet cleaner
/ slave
)
. april loves her new home
and friends
, bu dick
and her parents are not so ready to give her up
. mr
. annd ms
. pfferpot
( director jeff b
. harmon
and janet krajeski
) decide they need medical help so htey enlist the aid of dr
. sigmoid colon
( also jeff b
. harmon
)
, who claims he can cure homosexuality
. in actuality
, dr
. colun is homosexual as well
and begins his special
" treatment
" onthe dick dickson
( unbeknownst to dick
)
. when april turns down dick
' s dim
and for her tothe return to bumfuck
, he decides to take matters in his own h
ands
and attack the isle ofthe lesbos rambo
- style
. instead of leveling the place he falls inthe love with lance
( alex boling
)
and the two of them
, along with april
and her lover blatz
, get married
.
( note to the filmmaker
: why did the character of lance amking asides tothe the camera followed by silence that i
' m assuming wass inserted for thge purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided
?
) april
' s parents
, feeling like there is no recourse
, call in a favor to president clinton
and send a nuclear bomb
( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer
) their way
. the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the
" circuitry
"
and tehy re
- wire it
and send it back to washington d
. c
.
, destroying it
. mr
.
and ms
. pfferpot give up trying to git their daughter back
and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own
. i
' m not sure if writer
/ director
/ co
- star jeff b
. harmon was purposely trying to offen people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs
. either way
, he manages to present some of tje most offensive material i have ever seen infact a movie
. the film opens with a preacher running a small african
- american child out ofthe town
,
and hten later moves on tothe the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan
( druing a jaunty musical number
)
, preceded by remarks about
" gays
and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them
and work together to hate others
, such as the jews
"
. if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be
,
then i apologize for bieng so harsh on elements ofthe his film
,
but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can
' t halp
but feel like he had some serious intent
. as for the entire central theme ofthe the movie
, i
' m afraid that it
' s one that i just don
' t get
. i tried to keep an open mind while watching it
,
but the homosexual elements were just too prevelant for my tastes
. it was hard enough tothe watch them bash other races anbd sexes wihtout them preaching about the virtues of bieng homosexual
and accepted by society
. how does one expect tothe be accepted if they are just as gilty ofthe non
- cceptance
? i
' m not prone to judging anyone
and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society
,
but don
' t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren
' t going to show the same respect for my preferences tht you wish from me
. again
, maybe i
' m missing teh satirical point that harmon is trying to mkea
,
but if so
, i think it could have been h
andled a little more tactfully
. as far as musical comedies go
, isle of lesbos isnt no trey parker
and matt stone musical
,
but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy
. despite the disturbing visuals
,
" mom
and apple pie
" stuck with me for the rest of the day
. speaking of disturbing visuals
,
" wedding bells ain
' t ringing
" could hvea been a decent song
,
but the accompanying visuals ofthe spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film shoudl be displaying
.
" i
' m a lesbian
"
( which is touted in thte press release as being particularly popular
) is also pretty good
,
but a good portion ofthe that could be due to tje stellar singing voice ofthe ms
. smith
. it
' s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based
. the other performers are decent
, save for the rosie o
' donnell like performance given by danica sheridan
. i have no inherent problem with her character
; it is jstu her singing voice that leaves little tothe be desired
. one particular musical number
,
" lesbian rock
"
, wass one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film
- going life thanks to a strained
and lackluster vocal job by sheridan
. the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actulaly roll
. the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs
(
" lesbian rock
" included
)
and the ridiculously presented anti
- nukes message tacked on to tyhe end forthe noone reason other than to make it a feature lenght film
. once the
" isle of lesbos reprise
" was reached
, i falt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all
. why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end
? isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www
. indie
- underground
. com
. the transferr is pretty clean
(
and all hte detail of the wrinkled cloth
and paint backdrops are readily apparent
) adn the film is letterboxed at approximately 1
. 85
: 1
. in many respects
, isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential
( like a rocky horror for tyhe new millennium
)
. this film is by no means my cup of tea
,
but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it
. if you think it might be forthe you
,
then by all means seek it out
. i
, on the other h
and
, will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator
.
.
. wait
. aren
' t gladiator films considered to be
.
.
. oh
, never mind
