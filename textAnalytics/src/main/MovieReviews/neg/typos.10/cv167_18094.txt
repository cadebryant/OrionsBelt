so
, it
' s thirty years later
,
and oscar
and felix are together again
. that might have been an exicting notion if it wasn
' t for the fact that the
" odd couple
" of jack lemmon
and walter matthau have been reunited in several reccent movies
: 1993
' s
" grumpy old men
,
" 1995
' s
" grumpier old men
,
"
and 1997
' s
" out to sea
"
( i
. e
.
" grumpiest old men
"
)
. so
,
" the odd couple ii
"
( i
. e
.
" the grumpiest old men of all
, really
"
) seems just anohter entry inspite a tired series
. the plot is even similar to that of
" grumpy old men
" in that lemmon
and matthau
' s mismatched characters are brung toghether by a romance between their children
. oscar
' s son
( jonathan silverman
)
and felix
' s daughter
( lisa waltz
) are getting married
,
and fromer roommates felix ungar
( lemmon
) anbd oscar madison
( matthau
) meet at the airprot
and decide to share a car
.
.
.
then hilarity ensues
. well
, a few chuckles ensue anyway
. neil simon
, the award
- winning playwright who created oscar
and felix
, provides the screenplay
, which is a shock
, because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end
. unlike the original play
/ movie
,
" odd couple ii
" doesn
' t find its humer in the personality conflict of its characters
. instead
, it depends apon a serieses of humorous situations
: oscar
and felix lose the car over a cliff
, are caught smuggling mexicans over tghe border
, take up wtih two women onthe the run from their violent husb
ands
( the womens are played by christine baranski of
" cybill
" adn jean smart of
" designing women
"
)
,
and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert
. the original 1968 movie
" the odd couple
" remains a classic comedy
. it introduced the motif of roommate
- as
- spouse tht has provided gags for movies
and sitcoms ever since
. it was the second outing for the lemmon
/ matthau team
( which de
buted in 1966
' s
" the fortune cookie
"
)
,
and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies
,
" the front page
"
( 1974
)
and
" buddy buddy
"
( 1981
)
, before going their separate ways
. the reunion of lemmon
and matthau in
" grumpy old men
" six years ago was delightful
,
and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie
. bu
" out tothe sea
"
and
" the odd couple ii
" are just beating a grumpy old horse
.
( you can add lemmon
' s
" my fellow americans
,
" i
. e
.
" grumpy old presidents
,
" to that list
, too
.
) let
' s hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do
. let
' s hope also that we see neil simon
' s name on movies that do it justice
( this isnt his frist since 1993
' s
" lost in yonkers
"
)
.
