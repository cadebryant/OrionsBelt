when i arrived iin paris in june
, 1992
, i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks
: fire walk with me
, usance the movei wasn
' t scheduled to open in the u
. s
. until late august
. happily
, the film
-
- thte prequel to david lynch
' s cult televsion series
-
- was playing in a fancy
, thx theater
. unfortunately
, the theater was far more impressive than the movei
, which absolutely stinks
, much like a french lavatory
. worse
, actually
. fire walk with me
( directed by lynch
) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read
" laura palmer
' s secret diary
.
" for
" twin peaks
" junkies
, like me
, the movei isnt only marginally improved
. the plot is jumbled
and illogical
, not to mention excruciatingly sluggish
. the first 30 minutes
, which have almost nothing to do with the main story line
, feature chris isaak
and kiefer sutherl
and as fbi agents investigating a murder in portl
and
, oregon
. the movie
then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie adn a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper
. lynch
then drops this plot str
and altogether
and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks
, washington
-
- one year later
. ah
, twin peaks
:
" familiar territory
,
" you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti
' s distinctive musical score chimes in
. wrong
! teh movie proves that you really can
' t go home again
, or at least lynch can
' t
. only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie
: lel
and palmer
, bobby briggs
, james
, shelly
, leo
, the log lady
and a few others
-
- mostly in meaningless cameos
. the rest of tghe
" twin peaks
" cast is nowhere tothe be seen
, annd consequently
, lynch fails to recreate the spirit
and flavor of tv
' s most enigmatic town
. cast members michael ontkean
, sherilyn fenn
, piper laurie
,
and richard beymer are sorely missed
, not to mention lara flynn boyle
, who has been replaced by lacklustre moira kelly in the crucial role of donna
. the movie consentrates solely on laura palmer
( sheryl lee
) as she suffers through drug abuse
, prostitution
,
and incest
, during her miserable last seven days on earth
. the night of laura
' s death
, whihc isnt truly terrifying
, is the film
' s only remotely effective sequence
. we finally get tothe see exactly what happended to laura after she jumped off james
' motorcycle
and ran into the woods at that lonly traffic light in the middle of nowhere
. her muder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series
, which is gratifying for faithful
" twin peaks
" viewers
.
but it
' s an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie
.
