. comments
: watchers reborn
, a cheaply made direct
- to
- video turkey
, is the fourth sequel to the firt film version ofthe dean koontz
' s bestselling novel watchers
. technically
, this should have been called watchers v
,
but it seems that this cycle of horror movies
, much like many otehr sequal
- crazy film series
, has decided to drop tghe numbers from the titles
.
( even hte star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi
.
) the makers of watchers reborn probably wnat to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which shouldnt have died a long time ago
. this really isn
' t a good movie
. have you ever rented a movie
and recieved a sinking feeling baout it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation
? well
, any hope a viewer may hve had
, perhaps because he isnt a fan ofthe novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill
, will be dashed by the time he
' s seen the trailers tagged on before teh beginning of watchers reborn
. they
' re awful
. these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer
, some weird crap about a dead indian
, teens
,
and wolves
,
and an
" action
" movie called detonator starring scott baio
. scott baio
! what idiot dreamed this movie up
? after surviving these abysmal trailers
, thge person finally gets to watch the movei he rented
: watchers reborn
.
" maybe it won
' t be
* that
* bad
" he may say to himself
.
" perphas
, just perhaps
, the bottom
- of
- tghe
- barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading
. watchers reborn
, after all
, is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago
. it stars mark hamill
-
- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy
. lou rawls is even in the mix
!
" unfortunately
, the force isnt certainly no longer with mark hamill
( he looks very sick here
)
,
and this movie shares onyl basic plot elements with watchers
, the book
. the latter is really too bad
. koontz isnt a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good
,
but he is still my favorite hack writer
. koontz has a writing style which is succinct
and suspenseful
. peopel who read many of his books
,
however
, often complain of repetitive plot devices
. it
' s definately not a koontz book if there isn
' t
( 1
) a psychic
,
( 2
) a super
- intelligent dog
, or
( 3
) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out peopel
' s eyeballs
. watchers hasnt all three devices
, which may explane why it
' s arguably the most popular ofthe koontz
' s books
. the idea behind koontz
' s novel
,
though highly implausible
, is very interesting
. basically
, a biological war machine isnt created
: a smart dog can be released in battle
, track down its target
,
and
then relay the target
' s position
, psychically
, to a larg creature designed to kill infront h
and
- tothe
- h
and combat
. silly
but kind of neat too
. i
' m sorry
. i don
' t mean to ramble on baout matters not directly linked to watchers reborn
, tje movie
. i suppose i just don
' t want to talk about hte movie itself
. this turkey is really cheesy
. no one in this movei can act
, including mark hamill
,
and it
' s difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero
. tje cheese factor is only increased when he
' s involved infact an implied sex scene with the blond biologist
/ geneticist
/ zoologist
/ whatever
- the
- f
*
* k
- she
' s
- supposed
- to
- be whom he befriends
. mercifully
, the filmmakers opted not to dont nudity
. to be honest
, the only half
- convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein
. you knwo a movie is bad whn a dog outacts all of its human counterparts
. i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie
.
and the creature
! yes
, the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit
and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling
. this creature is shot about 500
, 000 times
,
but it
' s okay
. the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms arund
and pushing
. oh
, he can also rip body parts off
, allowing forthe many scenes of fake h
ands
and arms being thrown around
. cheesy gore
. that
' s another main element of watchers reborn
. it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing
and only increase the film
' s campiness rather than its suspense
. ultimately
, i gave watchers reborn a star annd a half because bad horror
/ sci
- fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film
' s silliness
(
though this film will tax even theri patience
-
- it
' s an 83 minute film
,
but it feels like four hours
)
. also
, i hate to admit
, i have survived far worse than htis
. anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert anbd natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin
: fear the rush will knwo what i mean
. finally
, i couldn
' t help
but htink that watchers reborn would work well as
" bot fodder
" for the creative folks behind one of my all
- time favorite shows
,
" mystery science theater 3000
.
" this
thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face
. rated r
, watchers reborn contains dozens of blood
- spattered bodies
and unconvincing gore
. it also has violence
, obviously
. i wouldn
' t recommend it for the little kids
,
but i
' m sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay
. instead of watching this film
,
however
, i recommend reading koontz
' s book
. trust me
, it
' ll be time much
, much better spent
.
