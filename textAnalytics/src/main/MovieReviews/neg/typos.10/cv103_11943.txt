if there
' s one thing i just can
' t st
and
, it
' s a film that oozes witht sentimentality
. here
' s a onot tothe all film makers
: films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves
. swelling
, saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy
,
and that the situation is hopeless
. alas
, my giant isnt a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently anbd with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up
. whta reminded me was that i wasn
' t choked up
, or even the slightest bit moved
, for that matter
. my giant is a forced
, contrived
,
and conspicuously un
- cute
( i detest the word
" cute
"
but i
' ve chosen to uise it because the makers clearly wanted to create a
" cute
" film here
)
. it tkaes a premise that might have been interesting
( i liked the preview
)
,
and bogs it down with endless plot turns
and cliches
, all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience
. maybe it will work for soem peple
. it didn
' t work for me
. billy crystal plays sam cayman
, an agent who
, at the beginning of tjhe film
, is in romania
. he
' s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film
. the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired
, git in a car accident
,
and get saved by an enourmous individule who st
ands almost eight feet tall
. his name is max
( gheorghe muresan
)
,
and sam thikns he
' d be a great movei star because of his size
. subplots are as follows
: sam has a son
and a wife
( kathleen quinlan
)
,
and he
' s never around for them
, so they move to chicago
. max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before teh film begins
. sam convinces max to go back to amercia with him so they can mkea lots of money
, annd so thier various subplots can all be resolved
. sam isnt broke
. max is dying
. pass the kleenex
. my giant
, as a comedy
, is only moderately funny
. it has its moments
, the best of which features steven seagal makeing fun of himself
. in one great scene
, sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal
; of course
, his son doesn
' t believe that he
' s actually speaking tothe seagal
,
and he goes off about how bad of an acto he is
( i would quote the line i like
but it would probably lose its effect
)
. crystal is always entertaining
,
and he has a few ogod lines here
( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely
)
; oftenly
,
however
, he
' s countered by a slew of jokes that aren
' t funny
,
and cause an involuntary rolling ofthe the eyes
. muresan is kind ofthe fun tothe watch
,
but he just cxan
' t act very well
. quinlan
, on the other h
and
, is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents
. she wass underused last year in both event horizon
and breakdown
,
but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff
. here
, the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent
. all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that
, for much of its running time
, is simply medicore
. as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion
,
however
, director michael lehmann
( who did a great job directing thge underrated hudson hawk
)
and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable
, each one intended specifically tothe pull at our heartstrings
. sam
' s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed
( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family
?
)
. later
, it turns out the entire story is supposted to be a great big metaphor signifying sam
' s reunion with his family
.
and some people might think that what sam does forthe max towards the end isnt a valiant thing
,
but i had a few morality problems with it
(
and i apoogize for being vague
)
. it
' s icky
. it drips with gooey
, wannabe human emotions
. my giant could ahve been a straightforward
and funny family film
. more importantly
, it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is
. instead
, it
' s a complicated
, overlong
,
and under
- engaging film that elicits too few laughs
and strives for superficial tears
.
and since it left me feeling completelyl unmoved
, i st
and by my possition that sentimentality is evil
and iwll ultimately destroy the world
.
