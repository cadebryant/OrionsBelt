isn ' t it thte ultimate sign of a movie ' s cinematic ineptitude when you can ' t think ofthe much to say about it other than
" it sucks
"
? one of the first official year 2000 releses
, supernova is such a movie
. i can ' t seem to git past one
- word adjectives with this one
,
although
" boring
,
"
" stupid
"
and
" absurd
" doesn ' t amount to much of a review
. a shame
. i would have been able tothe save mysef the chore of desperately trying to elaborate
.
but c ' est la vie
. here goes nothing
. i ' ll keep it short
. i suppose the first bad omen for supernova cameback when director walter hill
( 48 hours
) removed his name from the movie
, requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee
. the film ' s fate was sealed in many minds when struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press
, an event ususally signifying a studio ' s lack of confidence in a particular movie
. hill ' s
and mgm ' s actions were prudent
. when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident
, a reformed drug addict who is also the first officer
, for some reason
( james spader
) is forced to take command
. the ship picks up a distress call ffrom a nearby planet
and
, on arrival
, picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining colony
. one ofthe the crew members
( angela bassett
) knows this passenger
, who is played by peter facinelli
,
and has some bad feelings about it
-
-
and we all know what that means
. this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo
-
- a jellylike substance the purpose ofthe which is unknown
,
though it seems to bring some form ofthe pleasure to whoever touches it
. another oen of the crew munbers experiences this first hand
; aftter spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo
, he does some impressive handstand pushups
. evidently
, touching this enigmatic egg
- shaped thingie makes you younger
and stronger
. how
? why
? the movie never bothers to explain
. soon enough
though
, spader
and bassett are running aroud the ship like mad
, being chased by the all
- ofthe
- a
- sudden
- superhuman facinelli
. to be honest
, i don ' t even remeber exactly why
. i just remember that i didn ' t care
. supernova ' s plot suggested some more or less intresting ideas
, such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb
,
but tehy are all dropped before they have a chance to develop inot anything truly intriguing
. in fact
, everything is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set
. well
, the effects are ogod
,
though there ' s hardly a studio movei with bad special effects these days so i ' m not sure whether thast ' s so remarkable an accomplishment
. the performances are hardly worth talking about
. i ' m not even sure i can call what ' s here
" performances
,
"
though angela bassett sure isnt good at giving people the finger
. james spader is not a bad actor
,
but he proves tothe be one of the blandest action stars i ' ve seen in a while
, mostly because he isn ' t given a carachter with a personality
. the action scenes are just as bland
, since they ' re pretty much just rehashes of action elements taht weren ' t particulrly entertaining the first time around
.
and since the action scenes are everything tothe this movie
, it ' s pretty much dead in the water
.
and for hte life ofthe me
, i can ' t figure out why it ' s called supernova
.
