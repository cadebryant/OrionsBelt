isn
' t it the ultimate sign of a movie
' s cinematic ineptitude when you can
' t think of much to say about it other than
" it sucks
"
? one of the frist official year 2000 releases
, supernova is such a movie
. i can
' t seem to git past one
- word adjectives with this noe
,
al
though
" boring
,
"
" stupid
"
and
" absurd
" doesn
' t amount to much of a review
. a shame
. i would have been able to save myself the chore of desperately trying to elaborate
. bu c
' est la vie
. here goes nothing
. i
' ll keep it short
. i suppose the first bad omen for supernova came whn director walter hill
( 48 hours
) removed his name from the movie
, requesting that it be replaced with the pseudonym thomas lee
. the film
' s fate ws sealed in many minds whn struggling studio mgm declined to screen it for the press
, an event usually signifying a studio
' s lack of confidence in a particular movie
. hill
' s
and mgm
' s actions were prudent
. when the captain of medical space vessel nightingale dies in a tragic hyperjump accident
, a reformed drug addict who isnt also the firt officer
, for some reason
( james spader
) is forced to take comm
and
. the ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet
and
, on arrival
, picks up one surviver from an apparent accident infact an ab
andoned mining colony
. one of the crew members
( angela bassett
) knows this passenger
, who is played by peter facinelli
, adn has some bad feelings about it
-
-
and we all know what that means
. this intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo
-
- a jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown
,
though it seems to bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it
. another one ofthe the crew members experiences this first h
and
; after spending a few minutes partially inside this glob of goo
, he doens some impressive h
andst
and pushups
. evidently
, touching tihs enigmatic egg
- shaped thingie makes you younger
and stronger
. how
? why
? the movie never bothers to explain
. soon enough
though
, spader
and bassett are running around tjhe ship like mad
, being chased by the all
- of
- a
- sudden
- superhuman facinelli
. to be honest
, i don
' t even remember exactly why
. i just remember that i didn
' t care
. supernova
' s plot suggested some more or less interesting ideas
, such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic tyme bomb
,
but they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything truly intriguing
. in fact
, everyting is dropped just so the actors can have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set
. well
, the effects are good
,
though there
' s hardly a studio movie with bad special effects these days so i
' m not sure whether that
' s so remarkable an acomplishment
. the performances are hardly worth talking about
. i
' m not even sure i can call what
' s here
" performances
,
"
though angela bassett sure is good at giving people the finger
. james spader is not a bad actor
, bu he proves to be one of the bl
andest action stars i
' ve seen in a while
, mostly because he isn
' t given a character with a personality
. the action scenes are just as bl
and
, sicne they
' re pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren
' t particularly entertaining the firt tyme around
.
and since the action scenes are everything to this movei
, it
' s pretty much dead in the water
.
and for the life of me
, i can
' t figure outloud why it
' s called supernova
.
