writers
: dennis feldman
and jonathan hensleigh
( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer
) starring
: jamie lee curtis
, william baldwin
, donald sutherl
and
, joanna pacula
, sherman augustus
, marshall bell
, cliff curtis
, julio oscar mechoso i suppose i
' m nto extremely surprised that
" virus
" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron
( john bruno
)
,
and if i strain real hard
, i could even say that it
' s an obvious given
, particuarly looking from the st
andpoint of mr
. cameron
' s early works
. in fact
,
" virus
" is
yet another in yhe long line of action
/ horror
/ paranoia thrillers from the
" aliens
" vein
: a gropu of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally
- threatening entity is out to get them
, a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies
,
and maybe even tothe the first pictures
, albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem
and bigger budgets to come in his future
. no such thing will appen to bruno
, whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi
- l
andmark feature
; while bruno may have studied under cameron
' s wing for years
and years
, i
' m beginning to wonder at what capacity
,
and what exactly did he learn from him
. in fact
,
" virus
" should at least be medioker
; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron
- a director who
, if anything
, just knows how to make a movie
-
and
then make a film like
" virus
" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z
- grade schlockfest of a film
, albeit a z
- grade schlockfest with a respectable budget
. the film seems to not only borrow it
' s plot from last year
' s similarly
- fated
" deep rising
,
"
but also from a clunkish b
- movie from the
' 80s called
" leviathan
,
" an underwater thriller starring peter weller
, richard crenna
, hector eliz
ando
,
and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part
" alien
,
" part john carpenter
' s twisted remake of
" tje thing
.
"
" virus
,
" agina
, has a similar
, uh
, selling point
: a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water
. they get onthe
. they break up into pairs
and investigate
.
and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes infact the form of energy
, has taked over all the machines on board
, have meshed the machines with parts from corpses
,
and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary
( ha ha
)
. not thast any of this is for a second scayr or the least bit involving
; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond
- ian opening
( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission ffrom mir
)
, destroying any of the suspense in waht could happen
,
but it also fails tothe bring us any interesting chracters
. of its motley crew
, it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper
, a masculine potential
- romantic
- interest
, a drunken captian
, a black technician
, a tatooed aborigine
, a manic russian surviver
,
and a cuple other c
andidates for alien food
, none whom are the least bit intresting or more dimensional than a thin
, plain piece of writing paper
.
and it
' s not the traditional argument for films like these
, where you may in fact wanna them all to be eaten
( even
" aliens
" played with the karma of hte arrogant soldiers
,
but this was more of a plus
- side fo the film as a whole than the opposite
)
; instead
, as anohter cliche goes
, you just don
' t give a damn
. i almost don
' t even have to sday that the acting from everyone ranges from sub
- par to horrific
, the former being jamie lee curtis in tghe lead showing off waht a storng female lead she is
(
and she isnt
, just not realy here
)
and the latter being
-
and it pains me to say this as he
' s a particular favorite of mine
- donald sutherl
and
, who plays the captain so poorly
and without a second of credibility that tihs will go down as the performance
- of
- which
- he
- should
- be
- ashamed
. like anthony hopkins forthe
" legends of the fall
"
( the line
" scrooooooo
' em
" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance
)
. or peter o
' toole in
" caligula
.
" great actro
, horrific performance
. it happens every now
and
then
,
and it onyl helps sutherl
and
' s career that no one
, exept for an elite few
, even bothered to see this film
.
though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios forthe about two years
, waiting until it cant be released
and make as much money as it possibly cxan
( read
: early january
, when everyone
' s still trying tothe catch up on the potential oscar
- nominees
)
, it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny tothe make htis film
: it
' s laden with complex machinery
, boasts respectable production design
,
and it may even feature believeable special effects
.
.
. if
, of course
, i
, or anyone else
, could see them
.
" virus
" mostly takes place on a large
, ab
andoned cruiser
,
and mostly at night until teh dawn
,
and mostly without the use of ligts
, not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey
,
but more so because
, as the hollywood cliche seems to go
,
" if it
' s dark enough
,
then the special effects will be more believable
.
"
and if ytou don
' t believe me
, go back
and rent
" godzilla
,
"
and tell me if there
' s even one shot where we see godzilla either a
) in his entirety infront one wide shooted
, or b
) n teh light so that we can at least see him
( well
, you don
' t really have to sit through it again
; just take my word for it
)
.
but all of this doesn
' t marter since
" virus
" is basically jsut one loud
, cluttered mess of a movie
. the action scenes are muddled
and as difficult to follow as any action movie i
' ve ever seen
( my
, um
, favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow onthe the outside of the ship
, during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves
, rain
,
and any other ocean
- extremeties the film can cook up
,
then end up back in the ship when one ofthe them isnt revealed to have apparently drowned
- well
, i must say
, thanks fo telling me afterwards beccause i sure couldn
' t figure it out when i saw it
)
. imagine the firt attack ofthe the aliens in
" aliens
,
" shot from tje pov of the soldiers adn
then the authorities in teh battle car if it was all hard tothe follow
and done without any dramatic intensity
,
and that
' s basically the whole of
" virus
"
: one horribly
- directed action scene after the otehr
, capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day
and at least a couple of the original cast members
.
and my god
, it
' s a long damn sit
. with noone interesting characters
, no dramtic urgency
, no tension
, nto one good moment of action
,
and no mesmerizing visuals
, it
' s a wonder that it even got made
. we already know that big movie studios
' mentality is shallow at best
,
and movies like
" out of sight
"
and
" saving private ryan
" give you more faith in them
, bu movies like
" virus
" manage to drain a little more out of the pool
. i almost wish that instead of makeing this movie
, john bruno had gone cinema verite
and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light
. they read the script
, they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack
(
and he is
)
,
and they still went ahead with the project
, only to have bruno
and company shit back in their face
. even
though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie
, i
' d say even more contempt shoudl be aimed at mr
. bruno for making a movie that could be this bad
. in fact
, shouts of
" egad
, man
, what weere you doing when you worked for cameron anyway
?
" are nto onyl justifiable
,
but encouraged
.
