" it
' s just
.
.
. the way
.
.
. we are
.
"
-
-
- a rapist
( matt frewer
) responds to supergirl
' s
( helen slater
) query as to why she
' s being attacked
, an example of the mind
- numbingly bad dialogue in supergirl
. i
' ll admit it
.
.
. i love superman iii
. i konw it
' s hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more thna a vehicle for richard pryor
,
but i still think it
' s a worthy addtion to the man of steel franchise
. supergirl
, a spin
- off film of sorts from the series
' same producers
( alex
ander
and ilya salkind
)
, doesn
' t even rival superman iii in terms of quality
, let alone superman or superman ii
. supergirl lost me from the opening scenes
and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time
. as the film begins we see the residents of argo city
, a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in
" inner space
"
, go about their daily lives
. ok
.
.
. what
? so these are exiles from krypton
, which blew uv right
? were they living there before krypton exploded
? how do you get to
" inner space
"
? this whole
" inner spoace
" notion is never explained
, particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world
. how do they nkwo where superman went
? how do they know he took the name clark kent anbd now works at the daily planet
? these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me
. argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron
. one day the founder ofthe argo city
, zaltar
( peter o
' toole
)
, gives the omegahedron to superman
' s cousin
, kara
( helen slater
)
, for use as inspiration inaddition her art
. kara uses it to create a bug
- like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of
" whatever
" that protects the city
. inaddition the chaos
, the omegahedron sails out through the opening
, dooming the argonians to death
.
.
. in three days time
, or something
. kara
then climbs into a pod which zaltar hadnt designed for interdimensional travel
and chases affter the omegahedron to save her world
. the power source travels directly to earth
and l
ands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor
- league witch named selena
( faye dunaway
) who
, immediately before her dip was ruined
, announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel
( peter cook
)
. selena somehow knows that this ball fomr thte sky will help her with her evil plans
,
and she sets out to achieve world domination
. selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth
,
and that she
' s arrived as supergirl
( complete with appropriate costume
)
. supergirl emerges fomr the bottom of a lake when she arrives
. ok
.
.
. huh
? why does the omegahedron fall from the sky
but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake
? attention movie
: explain yourself
! i
' m sorry
, i can only suspend disbelief so much
. i can
' t buy inot any of this nonsense just becuase the movie wants me to
. knowing that she needs a secret identity
, supergirl basically
" wills
" herself into a school girl outfit
( complete with a diffrent hairstyle
)
, picks the alias linda lee
and enrolls into school
. she
' s given her dorm assignment
, annd who happens to be her roomate
? lois lane
' s sister
, lucy
. ok
, coincidence isnt one thing folks
,
but we
' re getting really contrived now
. what follows are some generic all
- girls school hijinks
.
.
. complete with evil bully girls
( mean for no reason
, of course
) annd even a shower scene
(
!
)
. best moment
though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform
and starts stuffing it withthe socks
. at this point i
' m rapidly wondering why i
' m bothering with this nonsense
. htere is some credit to give to the film howver
. one lengthy
and elaborate sequence featuring an
" evil
" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its
" prey
" is very well done
. also
, its commendable tothe see genders reversed in the film
, wheras tyhe women have all the power
and the men are merely objects
and tools
. hart bochner
( die hard
) is particularly fun as kara
' s love interest
, a lovesick l
andscaper who is under a spell cast by selena
(
al
though he isnt unfortunately part of one of the film
' s more ridiculous moments
, when he hasnt to be rescued from being tapped by some
" menacing
" bumper cars
)
.
then there were numerous little things that bothered me
. the flying effects are never convincing for a moment
.
.
. it
' s all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires
. instead of having her look like she
' s flying
, hte filmmakers wanted her to be
" graceful
"
, so she poses a lot
and does ballet
- tipe maneuvers
. also
, who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth
? a pair of truck drivers
/ rapists who immediately attack her
and
then meet a
" wacky
" demise
. there isnt alsot some rampant product placement in the film
, most notably for popeye
' s
, tylenol
,
and a
& w root beer
, with the latter actually putting its logo on the t
- shirt of one of the rapists
(
?
!
)
. finally
, just oen word
: monsters
. faye dunaway
and peter o
' toole ham it up unmercifully
,
however when o
' toole overacts he
' s entertaining
and when dunaway does it she
' s annoying
( her character actually says the line
" seize them
!
" at one point
)
. dunaway
' s henchmen
( played by peter cook anbd brenda vaccaro
) fare much better
, with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty
' s otis character from the first twpo superman movies
. helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as teh innocent
, naive character she
' s written to be
, as she
' s able tothe gaze at flowers
and bunnies with the right ammount of genuine wonder to make it believable
. believability aside
though
, it
' s still annoying
. now despite all this negativity
(
and i
' m not alone here
.
.
. supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles
)
, leave it to the good people at anchor bay enteratinment to actually make people nto only interested
,
but excited about its release on dvd
! they have released two separate editions ofthe the film on dvd
, to the delight of many people
( including myself
.
.
.
yet i
' m still unclear as to why
, since this movie is so awful
)
. the first
and most widely available dvd realease features the internation version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u
. s
. theaters
. the movie is presented in its origional theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 2
. 35
: 1
, is enhanced for 16x9 televisions
,
and has been remastered in full thx glory
. extras on the disc include
: a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc
and
" special project consultant
" scott michael bosco
, the excellent 50
- minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl
- the making of a feature
( dig that workout montage
!
)
, 5 trailers
, 3 tv spots
, talent bios
, in
- depth storyboards
( accompanyed by socre from the movie
)
,
and assorted still galleries
. the transferr on this international version is incredible
.
.
. you
' d thikn you were watching a new release
. images are sharp
, colors jump off the screen
,
and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts
. only some speical effects sequences show the wear of time
,
and there just isn
' t much that can be done about that
( unless you
' re obsessive like george lucas
)
. the new thx approved audio is loud
and clear in all the right places
, howver you
' ll be hearing absurd dialogue
and a medioker jerry goldsmith score
( which is completely unrelated to john williams
' classic superman theme
and sounds better suited for a cannon films
' golan
- globus production
)
. the commentary track featuring director szwarc
and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries
. bosco seems tothe be an expert in all things supergirl annd is there with szwarc to ensure that there
' s noone dead air on the track
. bosco probes szwarc fo information on virtually everyone
and everything that comes onscreen
,
and we learn a graet deal more about the film as a result of his participation
.
al
though
, at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc
,
and is surprised when he doesn
' t get that responce
. we learn some fascinating tidbits on the tarck
, most notably the
" almost
" appearance in the film by christopher reeve
. great detail is given about superman
' s proposed role in the original script before reeve
( wisely
) dropped outloud
. as it st
ands
, superman isnt written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission
. for the sake of brevity
, i won
' t even get into that one
. szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds
(
and everyone else agreed
) that supergirl needed to st
and on its pwn
, replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy
" whimsical fantasy
" nonsense
. bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along
, claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office
. again
, for hte sake of brevity
, i won
' t even get into tht one
. anchor bay has also released a limited edition
( only 50
, 000 copies pressed
) two
- disc set
. disc one containes everything mentioned for the regular release
. disc two features the never before seen director
' s cut of hte film
, which runs 138 minutes long
. the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don
' t add much of note
, exept for a few moments which leng
then peter o
' toole
' s screen time
( particularly during his latter appearances
)
. the print is rough in spots
and the sound is only in mono
,
but fans ofthe the film won
' t care
. one question
though
.
.
. shouldn
' t the director
' s commentary be on the director
' s cut of the film
? i
' d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd
. i ws nine when it was released to theaters
,
and even hten i was smart enough tothe inform my parents not to take me to see it
. so when i popped the dvd into my player
and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect
. i knew the film wasn
' t beloved
and i never had any interest in it before
,
but i was willing to give it a shot because of hte impressive amount of work put into the disc
. as the disc began to spin i was rether impressed iwth the opening sequence
, which made me sit uv adn wonder if my assumptions all this tiome could have been wrong
. come to find outloud
however it was jstu the chase digital stereo logo
.
.
. so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started
. at the end of the film
, supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron
,
and flies back to argo city
. ugh
, i give up
. i
' m surprised i even made it to the end ofthe the film not once
, not twice
,
but three times tothe review these discs
. supergirl is definitely a terific dvd package
,
but a very lousy movie
.
