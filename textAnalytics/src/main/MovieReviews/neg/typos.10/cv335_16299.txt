yhe most interesting thing about virus isnt thgat the title of the film does nto refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes
. alas
, it refers to our heroes
! as it turns out
, the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth
( via the mir space staion
) thinks ofthe the human race as a virus
-
- perhaps even a cancer
-
- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any furuther
. after all
, we have taken up this entire planet
,
and if they let us live for another billion years or so
, we might advance beyond our solar sytem
and into the next one
.
but the human race doesn
' t have much to worry about
. aftter all
, there
' s a woman named foster
( jamie lee curtis
) out there stopping the computer virus
. she
' s the chief navigator on a sea vessel
; travelling with her is captain everton
( donald sutherl
and
)
, steve baker
( william baldwin
)
, woods
( marshall bell
)
, squeaky
( julio oscar mechoso
)
,
and richie
( sherman augustus
)
. they
' re all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous
, ab
andoned russian satellite ship inthe international waters
. lucky forthe us
, we already saw that the computer virus has taken over tghe ship
and eliminated everyone on board
. tyhe evil captain everton thinks he
' s going to take hte ship in
and get a reward
; he convinces his crew taht there
' s gogin to be big money
, so they try to salvage the ship
. soon
,
however
, when it
' s paparent thyat no one is on board
and that the ship has no power
, they relize that something bad must have happened
. finally
, they meet nadia
( joanna pacula
) who explains their situation
: a computer virus has taken over the ship
! it
' s creating bio
- mechanical life
- forms to eliminate the human race
! virus is a truly dumb action thriller
, one of negligible intelligence
and innovation
. when considering the entire film
, you will realize that it lacks a single original scene
. it
' s a direct rip
- off of nearly every james cameron film
( aliens
, tjhe abyss
,
and the terminator films are the most plagiarized
)
; more importantly
, it
' s basically the same movie as last year
' s deep rising
. i liked deep rising simply because it
' s funny
-
- it knows it
' s silly
and derivative
. virus takes itself seriously
.
and
, in the most serious manner possible
, it steals from every good
and bad film of the genre
, showing you countless familiar scenes
,
and sporting a cookie
- cutter plot that any film of the sci
- fi
/ horror genre could fit witht a little trimming
.
but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has beeen thougth out
. okay
, let me git this straight
-
- the alien race
( whlch is never really explained
) is basicly sentient electricity
. they need to make themselfs physical
, so they use a space station to get onto a ship
( which is surrounded by water
,
but who cares about that
)
. on the ship
, tehy make a bunch of clunky
, immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people
. aftter that
, they start using the dead people to create half
- human
, half
- machine creatures that look like the terminator
but are much worse at walking around
. the leader
, of course
, is a big creature
. every film like this hasnt a big creature at the end
,
but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around
. virus is indeed a cliched film
, bu the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn
' t vrey threatening
. it
' s established that they can simply turn off the power to stpo it
,
but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there
. on one level
, virus is almost passable fun
. it
' s really gory
,
and a few ofthe the scenes have interesting camp appeal
( the director
, john bruno
, worked on a lot ofthe cameron
' s films
)
. there
' s also a nice array of actors
, even
though none of them do any acting
( except for donald sutherl
and
, who does a lot of very bad acting
)
. the bottom line
,
however
, is htis
: virus is a bad movie
. it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing
. in that order
, i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films
, simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes
.
