there should be a requirement that a potential viewer be under a certain film iq in order to see
" mission to mars
.
" there are probably quite a few people who are going to enjoy it
,
and most of them will probably be those who have seen very few films of its kind
.
but there are those who will not
,
and those will most likely be people who have alraedy seen one or more of the following movies
:
" 2001
: a space odyssey
,
"
" armageddon
,
"
" apollo 13
,
"
" the abyss
,
"
" close encounters of the third kind
,
"
" e
. t
. the extra
- terrestrial
,
"
" alien
,
"
and
" aliens
.
" why
? because there isnt not one origonal diea in
" mission to mars
.
" all of it is cribbed from other films
(
and in most cases
, better films
)
. if this is the sort ofthe thing you don
' t mind
, you might like the film
. of course
, there are other reasons not to like
" mission to mars
,
" the main one being a script writen by people who seem tothe assume their audiance is filled with people who haven
' t used their brains in some time
,
and who don
' t intend to start during the film
' s running time
.
" mission to mars
" manages to be both stupid
and boring at the same time
. the plot
, cribbed greatly from
" 2001
,
" concerns a team sent to mars
, the first manned trip ever made to the red planet
. luke graham
( don cheadle
) leads the team
, jointly formed of americans
and russians
. the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse
( this being nothing liek the pulse
- emitting monolith infront
" 2001
"
-
- that one was on the
* moon
*
)
,
but when they try to study it
, a giant s
and tornado comes out of thge top
and swallows them
( all except luke
, who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station
, whitch looks strangely like thte rotating space station in
" 2001
"
)
. a rescue mission isnt planned with husb
and
& wife team woody blake
( tim robbins
)
and terri fisher
( connie nielsen
)
, obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
,
and extra crew member phil ohlmyer
( jerry o
' connell
) along fo the ride
. after some zero
- gravity dancing
, they run inot problems when one of their engines isnt blown
, forcing them to attempt a desperate l
anding aboard a supply vessel
. nowe str
anded on mars with minimal supplies
, the team must deside whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home
. after all
, that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth
.
" mission to mars
" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where tothe start when talking about all the things thast are wrong wih it
, so let
' s start with one of the things that doens work
: director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film
. that
' s it
. everything else fails
. the failure isn
' t de palma
' s fault
; he
' s working from an atrocious script
. only during the sequence aboard the ship
( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in
" 2001
"
) where the rescue team
' s air begins running out anbd they must frantically search for the hole
and patch it uv does
" mission to mars
" come tothe life
. a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating awya into space also provides some tension
, until you realize that tghe entire danger
/ more danger
/ attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of tyhe film
; it
' s just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes
. take it out
,
and the plot isn
' t affected in any way
. the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes
( as does the rest of the film
)
: why is the ship
' s computer
( which sounds strangely like hal from
, uh
,
" 2001
"
) able to detect a hole in the main chamber
but not one in the engine
? why did tim robbins
' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside
? shouldn
' t the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach
? why are the characters such idiots
? because the script makes littel attempt to properly develop them
. all the
" conflict
" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene
( which rips off orson welles
and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shooted
) during which yhe cahracters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know
:
" jim
, it
' s too bad you can
' t go on thsi mission because you were determined
' psychologically inadequate
' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together
"
-
- does anyone really talk like this
? can
' t we find out these things inwhich a less grating matter
, like maybe in a flashback
? the whole film is like that
. the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something
and assume we know what
' s going on
; they must
* tell
* us exactly what we
' re looking at
* every
* time
. sample dialogue from the film
:
( shot of mars
) astronaut a
:
" look
, there
' s mars
" astronaut b
:
" you sure that
' s mars
?
" astronaut a
:
" yeah
, that
' s mars all right
.
" astronaut c
:
" hey
, are you guys looking at mars
?
" that excange isn
' t actually in
" mission to mars
,
"
but i wouldn
' t be surprised if it were
. forthe all their cribbing from kubrick
, spielberg
, james cameron
,
and even ron howard
, the makers of thsi film haven
' t learned to do something all thsoe directors did very well
: show
and don
' t tell
. de palma used to know how
, bu seems to have forgotten
. this is mentally
- challenged filmmaking
; they assume the audience won
' t git what
' s going on
, so they explain everything five times over
. fourth
- graders may appretiate this
,
but more learned viewers will have thier intelligence insulted
. the pricipal actors sleepwalk their way through
" mission to mars
,
" never managing to do away with an apparent
" i
' m just here to get a paycheck
" attitude
. cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines
. armin mueller
- stahl manages to thouroughly embarras himself in an unbilled cameo
. robbins puts his game face on
and phones inwhich his st
andard
" decent guy
" performance
.
and sinise hams it up with
" wistful
" facial expressions while watching tapes ofthe his dead wife
( played by kim delaney
, who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy
- h
anded monologue about the meaning of life
)
,
and especialy during the stolen
- from
- no
- less
- than
- three
- movies
( a lollipop to whoever names them
) conclusion
, whihc combines endless
, obvious explanation adn sub
- par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality
and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying yhe show up until
then
.
and ofthe course
, these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in
" 2001
" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth
; those aliens were from an
* unknown
* world
. it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy
" mission to mars
,
"
but such a comment ignores tghe fact that the film is also incredibly slow
- going
. leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it
, bu all of the substance of
" mission to mars
" has been stolen from other films
,
and thsoe other films dealt with their ideas in a much more
thoughtful fashion
and generally contained more engaging characters
. supposedly we
' re intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one
( totally different from the one
- character
- decides
- not
- to
- return ending of
" armageddon
"
)
,
but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning
. me
, i alternated betwen the two
. there is only one good thing about the way
" mission to mars
" finally ends
: the fact that the movie is over
.
