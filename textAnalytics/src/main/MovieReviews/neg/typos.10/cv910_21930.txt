> from writer
and director darren stein comes jawbreaker
, the poorly told tale ofthe what can hapen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong
. at reagan high
, four girls are sitting on top of the world
. courtney shane
, played by rose mcgowan
, holds the title of meanest
, most disrespectful soul in the school
. everyone hates her
,
but everyone envies her due to her popularity
. courtney is the
" leader
" of her clique
, which also includes julie
, played by rebecca gayheart
, liz purr
, played by charlotte roldan
,
anbd marcie
, played by julie benz are the other three infact thge group
. it is liz ' s seventeenth birthday
,
anbd julie
, courtney
,
and marcie concur that they iwll play a seemingly innocent prank on her
,
but the prank results in the death of liz
. just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one
, the foursome decide to cover uv the death to make it look like a murder committed by somene else
.
and also just like in other teen directed movies
, one ofthe the four don ' t agree with hiding it
, this time tyhat charcter being julie
.
and finally
, just like in other teen movies
, there isnt a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth
. tihs tiem that chracter being fern mayo
( judy greer
)
, who is subject to many cracks fomr courtney ' s group
, as well as the entire school
.
> from here
, jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge
, bad morals
,
and at least trying to do the right thing
. not only is the script weak
, on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main casted
. judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional
, annoying charcter
, as she overacts every line she has
. also on tyhe bad side of acting is julie benz
, almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers
. on the positive side ofthe acting
, rose mcgowan performs well here
,
but doesn ' t match her wickedly clever performance as
" tatum
"
, iin 1996 ' s scream
. mcgowan ' s role is annoying
,
but this only adds to the film
. she isnt wickedly mean
,
and even
though she a well
- written character
, you downright hate her
. faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart
, who is always exceptionally believable as her roles
. when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character
, she turns it into three
, always putting strong emotion
annd power into her roles
. gayheart isn ' t given as much to do here as she was in 1998 ' s urban legend
,
but yuo can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker
. jawbreaker drifts
and mianders different sub plots throughout
, hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in
. we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident
,
adn get into things that don ' t have anything to do with thge actual film
. the beginning
anbd endig are strong
, it ' s jstu the middle that needs a lot of help
. durig the body of tje movie
, it is undeniably repeative
, never progressing towards a conclusion
. nothing to grab the viewer ' s interest isnt around
,
anbd the same
, extremely annoying song plays over
and over again
. jawbreaker tries to get off on thge same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless
,
but falls flat
. the few gags that accually wokr die off quickly
and die off with a bang
. all in all
, a horrible disappointment
. the bottom line
: the tagline reads
,
" even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside
.
" yes
, that is too true
. noone matter how ogod thsi film may have looked
, it fails to deliver
.
