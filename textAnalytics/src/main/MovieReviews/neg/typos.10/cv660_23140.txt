are you like me
? do you get annoyed seeing people talk onthe their cellulars infront public places
, shouting out loud
, not giving a ratt
' s ass about anyone around them
,
and basicly just wallowing in their own self
- importance
? well if you are
, than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film usance it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour
and a half
.
.
. only to make up annd hug in the end
. aaaaaaaahhhh
.
.
. plot
: three grown
- up sisters living their own separate lives
, begin to re
- establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill
. critique
: this would be a good movie if it wasn
' t for the fact that it
' s got very little to say
, features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations
, is chockfull of bad acting moments
and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third
- rate after
- school special
.
and i
' m being nice
! how junk like this gets made is beyond me
,
but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow
, considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit
. the only true emotional moment demonstrated beetwen meg ryan
' s character
and her dad in this film is when he hugs her
and swings her around at a christmas tree lot
. wow
.
.
. how deep
. ofthe course
, the same christmas tune that
' s played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background
, while characters continue to build
" bonds
" amung one another by making reference to old
, quaint movies or movie stars
. stop me
.
.
. i
' m gonna cry again
! this film is a mess
. the charactors are boring
and irritating to watch
, the plot hasnt something to do with three selfish sisters talking onthe the phone a whole lot
, kind ofthe liking their father
(
but not really
)
and thn finally realizing the error of theri ways
, while sharing an
" emotional
" moment baout movie stars from the 50s
. admitedly
, i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds
and a big dog rolling its eyes
,
but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude wehn it came to some of tje acting efforts put forth in this film
. meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot
, looking as adorable as ever
,
but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home ofthe limited range
, cause thsi woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie
/ tv show that she
' s in
. enough alrady
!
and diane keaton must
' ve spent more time thingking about her role behind the camera in htis one
, cause her acting was amateurish at best
. neither one convinced in
" emotional
" scenes
. granted
, they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film
and that
' s probably where my rating of three points comes from
. all in all
, this movie is not funny
( unless you
' re one tothe chuckle at train wrecks
)
, provides zero drama
( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving
)
, generates absolutely no emotion
(
al
though i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine
)
and ends on a perfectly pretentious note
(
" oh noone
, please don
' t get any flour on my donna karan dress
!
)
. ugh
. i suggest that all ladies take their husb
ands
/ boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something
! that
' ll teach
' em to mess with you
! oh
and incidentally
, mrs
. joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in teh wind
, so there
!
then again
.
.
. maybe you
' ll like it
.
