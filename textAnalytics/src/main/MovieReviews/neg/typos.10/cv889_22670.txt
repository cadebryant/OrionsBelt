some movies
' pre
- release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they
' re finally released
, everyone just goes along with it
. thus sometimes
, films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls
and some even score nominations
. lastr yearm it was the thin red line
. this eyar
' s
" winner
" is the hurricane
, pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits
and votes iin the office oscar pool
. acclaimed director norman jewison
' s biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies wihtout any of the funn
.
and that
' s supposed to be ok because
, see
, it
' s a true story
. it
' s about rubin
" hurricane
" carter
( denzel washington
)
, a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted ofthe triple homocide with the help of a ghastly
( racist
!
) detective
( dan hedaya
) who
' s had it in for tghe
" big
- shot
" hurricane ever usance he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife
( in self
- defense
but who cares
, right
?
) when rubin was only ten
. he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole
. most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison
. to the rescue
-
- lesra martin
( vicellous reon shannon
)
and his team of wanna
- be detectives
. lesra is an african american teenager tooked in by three well
- off canadian white people
( hanna
, unger
, schreiber
) to get an eduction
. lesra
and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his veyr first book
-
-
" the sixteenth round
,
" rubin
' s autobiography
. immediately thereafter
, schreiber
' s charachter tells lesra
" sometimes we don
' t pick the books we read
, they pick us
.
" hmmm
. after a few visits tothe the prison
, they become convinced of rubin
' s innocence
and lauch their own full
- scale investigation even
though two juries have convicted him
. they meticulously go through all the files
and revisit all the old witnesses
( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old womens who slam the door in their faces
?
)
and in tjhe course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane
' s innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings
. ofthe course
, we
' re already told that he
' s innocent
. a movie like this is especially frustrating because we
' re not bieng shown everyting significant that happened to carter during this period in his life
. all too obviously
, we
' re getting the hollywood watered
- down version
. that would be ok except that tyhe parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it
. it
' s almost cruel
. the melodrama isn
' t ofthe the entertaining kind either
; it
' s the hokey
, rammed
- down
- your
- throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity
. wittness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant psuedo
- saintliness of our four protagonists
. the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it
' s a no
- frills courtroom movie
. it
' s formula stripped to the bare necessities
. you have your wrongly accused black man
. you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene
.
but there
' s nothing else
. ytou
' d expect soem sort ofthe involving investigation
. bu that
' s nto necessary since we
' re implicitly informed of his innocence
. thus the whole middle portion of the movie isnt reduced to the protagonist brooding
. brooding to himself
. brooding to other inmates
. brooding to lesra
. brooding to lesra
' s canadian friends
. brooding in letters
. i don
' t tihkn i
' ll ever look at brooding the same way again
. it wasn
' t long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane
' s exceedingly deep meditations on his condition
. i wanted something to happen
. as for washington
' s performance in the title role
-
- i figured i
' d have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it
' s received
-
- he is top notch
,
though still boring
. how is that possible
? well
, he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly
. unfortunately what jewison asked him to do isnt a load of crap
. what a waste of a great performer
. speaking ofthe wastes
, why the hell doed john hannah agree to do this
? he
' s an extremly talented actor
and i love him dearly
,
but what is he doing here
? to call his character
( along with schreiber
' s
and unger
' s
) a stick figure would be a gross understatement
. all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas
, as benevolent as do
- gooders come
. if they
' re to play a major part in htis movie
, why not make them real people
, with real feelings
and emotions
? look
: if you
' re going to mkea a formula movie
, don
' t undermine hte formula
. courtroom dramas can be fun
,
but this is ridiculous
. not only is it trite
, it
' s boring
.
