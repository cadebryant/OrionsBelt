i
' m a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson
' s work
. he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue
and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain
. with teaching mrs
. tingle
, his directorial de
but
, williamson has reached the end of his rope
. what used to be intteligent about his films is hopelessly stale here
. the components are all there
, including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate tothe
.
but where are the thrills
? the laughs
? both are supposedly absent ffrom this draggy exercise inaddition elaborate revenge
.
and what a shame that is
. i loved tghe scream films
- heck
, i even enjoyed the sci
- fi goofiness of the faculty
. kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office
. teaching mrs
. tingle
, a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers
, may put an end to his reign
. or perhasp it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties
. i still have my faith
, bu i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past
. the title character of his pet project is a vicious
, uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over
- the
- top by british actress helen mirren
. mrs
. tingle is basically every student
' s worst nightmare
: a heartless human being bent on distri
buting poor marks to even the most hard
- working of her pupils
. the principal
( michael mckean
) is horrified of her
, anbd she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members
. i enjoyed the fact that everyone in teh hallway quickly steers out of her way
. mirren
' s peformance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink
. in other words
, it
' s a poor substitute for williamson
' s best work
. the plot is a big problem here
. material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor h
andling onthe the part of the director
. the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann
, an over
- achiever hoping to get a college scholarship
.
but typical mrs
. tingle says her history project
, which she worked on for countless hours
, is laughable
. later on while studying in the gymnasium
, a classmate
( barry watson
) offers her a photo
- copied duplicate of mrs
. tingle
' s final exam
. leigh ann
' s best friend
( marisa coughlan
) encourages her to use it
. alas
, the old hag herself finds the three scheming
,
and snatches tje tust
,
and prepares to talk to the pricipal in the morning
. in the morning
.
.
. how convenient
! the three students head to mrs
. tingle
' s house
, attempting to set the facts straight anbd clear leigh ann
' s name
. things git out ofthe h
and
,
and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle
. the plan is to tie her to a bed
and try to get some reasoning out of her
. of course
, not everything goes entirely to plan
. besides pointless sub
- plots involving the football coach
( jeffrey tambor
, horribly wasted
)
, there is little by way of actual progress
. there is no urgency tothe the situation
; little tension or laughs are involved
. the humor is completely inconsistent
. after many of teh jokes
, the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze
. you continue to await some momentum in thge story
, something tyhat could possably revive the slow pace
. a moment liuke that never arises
. williamson also does a h
andsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players
, including the talented mckean
and larry s
anders
' vet tambor
.
and the beautiful vivica a
. fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor
,
and
then williamson disposes of her character entirely
. onthe the plus side
, holmes
and coughlan are admirable
( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression
)
, anbd molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher
. while everything is pretty lifeless
, teaching mrs
. tingle remains watchable
. there are a few promising ideas that pop up now
and again
,
but anything remotely interesting is squ
andered by the inane script
. mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching
. she is convincingly evil
and funn to watch
,
but even her gifted delivery can
' t save individual scenes that flounder in boredom
. if there is one owrd for the movie surrounding her
, it would be
` disappointing
'
. basically
, kevin williamson is his worst enemy here
. his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated
( not that his writing here is especially good
)
. we will see
, when rookie screenwrighter ehren kruger writes the third installment in thge scream franchise this christmas
, whether williamson is for real
.
