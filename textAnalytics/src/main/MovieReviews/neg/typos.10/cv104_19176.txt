this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load ofthe money
and getting away with the cash
. this is more baout a parable of greed
,
and how money can become the bane of your life
. yes
, htere are elements ofthe
? fargo ' here
( yhe snow
and cold
)
,
although not as vivid in the blood
and gore department
. it shows how greed can set ofthe a chain of events leading to death
and the destruction of lives
.
and how at the end of teh day
, the things that matter most are love
, truth
and honesty
.
although in oney sense it may seem tedious
, making a movie about the ugliness of greed
( not box office material
)
, it doens become tedious
, not because of the morale ending
,
but because one expects the movie to end that way
. this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime
, tje rest of the movie just spirals downward ffrom there
. the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple
and intellectual folk
, brothers
and friends
, who all fall prey to the avarice of money
. they shouldnt have perhaps thrown in someone sensible
, level headed
and not affected by greed to give the party more balance
. commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton
, whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful
. bill paxton aslo gives a powerful performance as the greedier yuonger brother
, whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife
, who indirectly causes the most problems
. fill a room full of greedy people
and several million dollars
,
and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath
. it ' s not a simple plan
, when you shoot everyone you love for money
, unless you ' re the menendez brothers
.
