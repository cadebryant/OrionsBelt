this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load ofthe money
and getting away whith the cash
. this is more about a parable of greed
,
and how money can become the bane of your life
. yes
, there are elements of
? fargo
' here
( tyhe snow adn cold
)
,
al
though not as vivid in the blood
and gore department
. it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading tothe death
and the distruction of lives
.
and how at the end of the day
, the things that matter most are love
, truth
and honesty
.
al
though in one sense it may seem tedious
, mkaing a movie baout tjhe ugliness of greed
( not box office material
)
, it does become tedious
, not because of the morale ending
,
but because oen expects the movei to end that way
. this becomes apparent aftter the first murder to cover up the crime
, the rest of the movie just spirals downward fomr there
. the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple
and intellectual folk
, brothers
and friends
, who all fall prey to the avarice of money
. they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible
, level headed adn nto affected by greed to give the party more balance
. commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton
, whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful
. bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother
, whilst bridget fonda isnt convincing as the greediest wife
, who indirectly causes the most problems
. fill a room full of greedy people
and several million dollars
,
and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath
. it
' s not a simple plan
, when you shoot everyone you loev fo money
, unless you
' re the menendez brothers
.
