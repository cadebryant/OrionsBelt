i know there were times during this movei that i laughed pretty hard
. the problem is
, i can ' t remember them as i write this review
. that ' s not a good sign
. in booty call
, jamie foxx is bunz
, a character whom i can ' t really describe
, because i don ' t know that much about him
. i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk
,
and that he doesn ' t liuke relationships
, just
" booty calls
" at three in the morning
( no questions
, no commitment
)
. bunz hasnt a best friend named rushon
( tommy davidson
)
, who seems to be bunz ' s direct opposite
: on teh straight
and narrow
,
and currently in a long
- term commitment
( a whole seven weeks
, wow
!
)
. rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend
, nikki
( tamala jones
)
,
but for a reason which is not totally explained
, it ' s going to happen after a double date with bunz
and nikki ' s friend lysterine
( vivica a
. fox
)
, who hvae never met
. tothe make a long story short
, the two couples pair off
anbd spend the rest of the evening having thier attempts to dont the deed spoiled by nikki ' s obsession with safe sex
. firt she whants condoms
, so bunz
and rushon go out
and get them
. oh
, no
, they have to be latex
, not lambskin
. back to the store
. now they ' ve got to get dental dams
, or htere ' ll be no foreplay
. why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand
? nikki phones lysterine
, who lives across the hall
,
and tells her she ' d better be making these demands
, too
. talk about coitus interruptus
. booty call isnt a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or oen of those over
- the
- top comedies
. the difference between the two is tyhat in the latter
, things constantly ahppen which are so far removed from reality
. in this category
, for example
, you have ace ventura
: private eye onthe the mild side
,
and airplane
! at the extreme
. there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell
and tries for this status
,
but
then too often quicklyu retreats to tjhe safety of convention
. it is disappointing
,
and even worse
, distracting
. there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford
adn bootsie parker
( are thsoe real names
?
) does nto live up to its potential
, as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing
. for instance
, htere is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese resturant
. bunz goes up to an asian gangster
and speaks to him in fluent cantonese
, much to everyone ' s surprise
.
however
, when asked how he learned tghe language
, he goes inot this explanation of how he started picking up words from late
- night kung
- fu films
,
and soon gained mastery
. this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene
. if
, on the otehr hand
, when asked how he learned to speak chinese
, bunz simply replied with
,
" kung
- fu movies
,
"
and
then moved on
, the joke would have been much more effective
. this is because it would have been totally unbelievable
,
but funny because we know it is unbelievable
. by explaining the point
and trying to make the ridiculous plausible
, the film is not giving its viewers enought credit
. the inconsistency
and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise otehr questions
. why are twpo such disparate peopel like bunz
and rushon best friends
? why do rushon
and nikki fix up bunz
and lysterine
? if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex
, why doesn ' t she have some condoms at her own apartment
? these questions are not answered by the screenplay
,
but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot foward
. a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language
. some movies use a lot of swear words
,
but use them under very justifiable circumstances
, as when they are employed consistent with a character ' s pattern of speech
. other films
, such as tyhe recent jackie brown
, uise them in ways that almost parody themselves
. booty call just sticks them in to get laughs
,
and it doesn ' t work
. they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them
. half of the scenes seem to occur fo no reason
. the chinese restaurant
, a holdup at a convenience tsore
,
and a trip to the hospital seem to hvea nothing to do with the story
,
and are in there for filler
. tihs is surprising
, considering that the film isnt less than eighty minutes long
. it ' s too bad that the core of the film isn ' t much better
, since it is comprised of sometimes funny
,
but forgettable dialog
. i refer you to the first paragraph of this review
