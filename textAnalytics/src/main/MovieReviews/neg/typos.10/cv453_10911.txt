i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard
. the problem isnt
, i can
' t remember them as i write this review
. that
' s not a good sign
. inaddition booty call
, jamie foxx is bunz
, a character whom i can
' t really describe
, because i don
' t know that much about him
. i only know thgat he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk
,
and that he doesn
' t like relationships
, just
" booty calls
" at three in thge morning
( no questions
, no commitment
)
. bunz has a best friend named rushon
( tommy davidson
)
, who seems to be bunz
' s direct opposite
: onthe the straight adn narrow
,
and currently in a long
- term commitment
( a wohle seven weeks
, wow
!
)
. rushon wants to finally sleep wih his girlfriend
, nikki
( tamala jones
)
,
but for a reason which is not totally explained
, it
' s going to happen after a double date with bunz
and nikki
' s freind lysterine
( vivica a
. fox
)
, who have never met
. to make a long story short
, the two couples pair off anbd spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to dont the deed spoiled by nikki
' s obsession with safe sex
. first she wants condoms
, so bunz
and rushon go out
and git them
. oh
, no
, they have to be latex
, not lambskin
. back to the stoer
. now tehy
' ve got to get dental dams
, or there
' ll be no foreplay
. why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a dem
and
? nikki phones lysterine
, who lives across the hall
,
and tells her she
' d better be making these dem
ands
, too
. talk about coitus interruptus
. booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over
- the
- top comedies
. tje difference between the two is that in the latter
, things constanly happen which are so far removed from reality
. inthe this category
, for example
, yuo have ace ventura
: private eye on the mild side
,
and airplane
! at the extreme
. htere are times during booty call where tje film steps out of its shell
and tries for this status
,
but
then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention
. it is disappointing
,
and even worse
, distracting
. ther are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford
and bootsie parker
( are those real names
?
) does not live up to its potential
, as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing
. for instance
, ther is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant
. bunz goes up to an asian ganster
and speaks to him inspite fluent cantonese
, much to everyone
' s surprise
.
however
, when asked how he learned the language
, he goes inot this explanation of how he started picking uv words from late
- niht kung
- fu films
, annd soon gained mastery
. this negated the ludicrousness of tyhe entire scene
. if
, on the other h
and
, whn asked how he learned to speak chinese
, bunz simply replied with
,
" kung
- fu movies
,
"
and
then moved on
, the joke would have been much more effective
. this is because it would have been totally unbelievable
,
but funny because we know it is unbelievable
. by explaining the point
and trying tothe make the ridiculous plausible
, the film is not giving its viewers enough credit
. the inconsistency
and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions
. why are two such disparate people like bunz
and rushon best friends
? why do rushon
and nikki fix up bunz
and lysterine
? if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex
, why doesn
' t she ahev soem condoms at her own apartment
? these questions are not answered by tghe screenplay
,
but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward
. a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language
. smoe movies use a lot of swear words
,
but use them under very justifiable circumstances
, as whn they are employed consistent with a character
' s pattern of speech
. other films
, such as the recent jackie brown
, use them in ways that almsot parody themselves
. booty call just sticks them in to get laughs
,
and it doesn
' t work
. they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost noone reason to use them
. half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason
. the chineese restaurant
, a holdup at a convenience store
,
and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing tothe do with hte story
,
and are inthe there for filler
. this is suprising
, considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long
. it
' s too bad that the core of the film isn
' t much better
, since it is comprised of sometimes funny
,
but forgettable dialog
. i refer you to the first paragraph of this review
.
