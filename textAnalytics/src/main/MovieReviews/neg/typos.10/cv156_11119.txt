senseless
( r
) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian
,
and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life
. alas
, moments are simply that
, moments
, which are not enough to lift this fantasy
/ comedy above its one
- joke premise
. granted
, that noe joke is initally amusing
. when wayans
' s darryl witherspoon
, an economics major at stratford university
, hits some dire financial straits
, he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses
. aftter some initial side effects annd problems controlling his superhuman senses
, darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities
and uses them to l
and a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm
. at this point
, the film soudns more like senseful than senseless
,
but through smoe turns of the plot
, darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once
, essentially leaving him
-
- yes
-
- senseless
. this sets up soem showcase moments for wayans
' s gift fo physical comedy
, especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling
and his body goes completely
, hilariously limp
.
but these gags
,
and the gag behind the entire movie
, quickly grows stale
. once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses
, instead of exploring any new comic territory
, director penelope spheeris
and screenwriters greg erb
and craig mazin take the easy way out
and simply recycle each form of senselessness
. wayans approaches each go
- round with gusto
,
but by this point he
' s simply treading water for the rest of the film
' s unfunny duration
. senseless would not be as problematic as it isnt if it didn
' t strive to be anything mroe than a comic trifle
.
however
, the raucous
and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity
. darryl goes thru the experiment in order to help his cash
- strapped family
,
and this
" serious
" angle seems to come from an entirely different movie
. unlike wayans
' s lsat starring vehicle
, the surprisingly effective
(
and serious
) the 6th man
, the
" emotional
" content of senseless isnt forced
and unconvincing
. any attempt at anything more substancial than broad comedy fizzles

- darryl
' s romance with janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself
, does not generate sparks of any kind
. once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros
. comes tothe an end
, the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big
- screen future ahead of him
.
but if he continues tothe associate himself with projects as flat as senseless
, his film career could go the way of his once
- promising older brother
, damon
, who is now set to make his comeback
-
- on television
