the general
' s daughter is a heartless
, absurd film
, a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters
. director simon west treats issues liuke rape
and sexual fetish with ham
- h
anded obscenity
, creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation
and offensive pseudo
- depth
. waht
' s worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by twpo characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic
-
- the rediculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm
. john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess
, playing warrant officer paul brenner
; brenner is assigned to find the murderer
and rape of captain elizabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, daughter of general joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. brenner isnt teamed up with ex
- spouse sarah sunderl
and
( madeline stowe
)
,
and they check out all yhe suspects on the base
, including elizabeth
' s mentor
, colonel moore
( james woods
)
. soon
, it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual tsuff
,
but tjhe question comes down to why
-
-
and
, of course
, who
. ebert
' s law of the economy of characters can be applied here
; one intresting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point
( including the two protagonists
)
,
but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story
. perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that
,
but it
' s painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something
. on a stopry levle
, the general
' s daugher is ineptly constructed
. the film
, adapted by christopher bertolini
and william goldman fomr nelson demille
' s novel
( which was apparently based on a true story
)
, plods along to its conclusion
, filling in the blanks with stale
, unrealistic dialogue
and
" shocking
" plot developments
. having not read the novel
, it
' s difficult to determine if these problems are yhe fault of the adapters or the original author
,
but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree
. scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity
; minutes affter finding the dead young woman
, brenner adn sunderl
and engage inaddition sarcastic dialogue
, which includes endless strings of forced lines
.
( sunderl
and actually asks brenner
,
" why was she killed
?
" tothe wich i would have answered
,
" if i knew
,
then the movei would already be over
.
"
) only after we
' ve spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they haev a sordid history together
; this angle
,
though apparently present to develop their characters
, is never explored
. nto that it really matters
, since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot
. in one scene
, sunderl
and isnt attacked by a man in a mask
. she sees one of his rings
,
and she
and brenner find the man later that day based on tje ring
. instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect
, they take him to brenner
' s houseboat
, beat him up
,
and pour hot coffee in his lap
. this scene really pushed me over the edge
, not because it
' s gratuitous
and mean
- spirited
,
but because it illustrates the film
' s complete disregard for the characters annd the audience
. it was impossible for me to feel anything for these peple beyond this scene
, mostly beacuse nothing they do comes as a surprise
. i realized that these constructs on screen aren
' t actually characters
,
but devices present only tothe serve the story
. this would have been bad enough without the west
' s need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape
and sexual misconduct
. compelling films about sexual crimes don
' t spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks
,
and they certainly don
' t show as much skin
and sweat as a typical pornographic picture
. these scenes are not the least bit poverful
; on the contrary
, they
' re intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain
, whomever that may turn out to be
. in addition
, the movei treats sexual fetishes
-
-
and sadomasochism in particular
-
- as if it
' s a perversion of everything we know to be pure
. htis st
andpoint is certainly allowed
,
but only in accompaniment with well
- developed themes to back it up
. as it is
, the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes
,
and that putting on a pair of h
andcuffs does not make a person insane
. perhaps the only postive elements infact the general
' s daughter are a couple of tjhe performances
. james woods has a few terrific scenes
,
and plays his role with sharp
, witty subtlety
. i also liked james cromwell
, mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic dispite the obvious intent of west to make him villianous
. nonetheless
, these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary
, obligatory atmosphere
and the senseless neglect of characterization
. yhe general
' s daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film
-
- it pretends to have a soul
, to be of strict moral code
, when inwhich fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut
- outs force
- feeding the audience a toxic l
andfill of plot contrivances
and one
- sided moral judgments
.
