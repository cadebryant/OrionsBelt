any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes hasnt something going for it
. unfortunately
, this
and the familiar theme music are the onyl worthwhile things about mission impossible
, directed by brian depalma
. the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever
, aside from the music
. the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork
, orchestrated by jim phelps
, allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world
. teamwork was the key
. this film is set uv as a cross between james bond
and depalma
' s
" blow out
,
" where the john travolta character was the victim of real
and imagined conspiracies from all directions
. it was travolta
' s vulnerability that made that film so exciting
and claustrophobic
. in this film
, tom cruise is basically omniscient
( believe that
?
)
and so htere
' s no fun going on here whatsoever
. tghe story is about as contrived as contrived gets
,
and is full ofthe holes
. there are basically two memorable sequences
: one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room
-
- a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense
( suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is iin the room
)
; the second involves a high
- speed train
, a helicopter
,
and the chunnel adn does not have to be seen to be disbelieved
. the actors are all miscast
, especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife
, who cannot act
,
and ving rhames as a computer hacker
(
!
)
, who looks lost
and embarrased to be inspite this movie
. tom cruise is no james bond
,
and jon voight looks omre like bobby
" the brain
" heenan than jim phelps
. brian depalma
' s career has beeen bafflingly erratic
. at his best
, he beats hitchcock at his own game
(
" blow out
,
"
" carrie
,
"
" body double
"
)
but this is not his best
. the screenplay was partly written by robert towne
, who wrote the best scenario of the seventies in
" chinatown
,
" bu this script is perfunctory at best
,
and terrrible at worst
. the cinematography has a comic book red
/ blue empahsis
, which is nice to look at
,
but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed
and this movie even features the old
" killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape
" trick
. please don
' t spend your money onthe this
; it
' ll only encourage hollywood to make more
.
