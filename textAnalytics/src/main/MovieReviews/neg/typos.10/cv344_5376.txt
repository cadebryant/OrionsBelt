any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it
. unfortunately
, this
adn the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile thigsn about mission impossible
, directed by brian depalma
. the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever
, aside from the music
. the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork
, orchestrated by jim phelps
, alowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world
. teamwork was the key
. this film is set up as a cross between james bond
and depalma ' s
" blow out
,
" where the john travolta charactor was the victim ofthe real
and imagined conspiracies from all directions
. it was travolta ' s vulnerability that made that film so exciting
and claustrophobic
. infront this film
, tom cruise is basicaly omniscient
( beieve tyhat
?
)
and so there ' s no fun going on here whatsoever
. the story is baout as contrived as contrived gets
,
and is full of holes
. there are basically twpo memorable sequences
: noe involves breaking inot a kubrickesque computer room
-
- a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense
( suffice it to say that tjhe alarm system is disengaged when tjhe computer operator is in the room
)
; the second involves a high
- speed train
, a helicopter
,
and the chunnel
and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved
. the actors are all miscast
, expecially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife
, who cannot act
,
and ving rhames as a computer hacker
(
!
)
, who looks lost
and embarrased to be in this movie
. tom cruise is no james bond
,
and jon voight looks more like bobby
" the brain
" heenan than jim phelps
. brian depalma ' s career has been bafflingly erratic
. at his best
, he beats hitchcock at his own game
(
" blow out
,
"
" carrie
,
"
" body double
"
)
but this is not his best
. the screenplay was partly writen by robert towne
, who wrote the best scenario of the seventies inaddition
" chinatown
,
"
but this script is perfunctory at best
,
and terrrible at worst
. the cinematography has a comic book red
/ blue emphasis
, which is nice tothe look at
,
but the suspense sequences are all telegraphed
and this movei even features the ood
" killer who talks too much before shooting thus giving the victim time to think of an escape
" trick
. please don ' t spend your money on this
; it ' ll only encourage hollywood to make omre
.
