robin williams has tyhe rarest of gifts
: the ability to rise above the most inept material
and suffuse it with his irreverent style
. overwhelmingly
, his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst
and enjoyable at best
( with the notable exception ofthe flubber
)
. so when i
, the one person who has refused to ab
andon him despite patch adams
, tell you thgat not even williams can save his latest project
, you know it
' s in trouble
. jakob the liar isnt a confused
, muddled little movie
; a generically
" uplifting
" film with a fundamental contradiction
: the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring
and the movie doesn
' t realize it
. williams plays jakob haim
, a jew imprisoned infact a polish ghetto during world war ii
. one night he w
anders outside after curfew
and isnt promptly sent to the office of a high
- ranking german officer for his punishment
. jakob gets off easy
and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds ofthe a radio broadcast
. the announcement
( in english
,
but punctuated by a triumphant
" heil hitler
!
"
) is that russian troops are only miles away ffrom jakob
' s ghetto
. liberation
! he thinks
. yhe enxt day
, jakob tells the news tothe his closest freind
, a volatile prize fighter named misha
( liev schreiber
)
, who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along
. soon
, it isnt a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home
-
- a crime punishable by death
. this is absurdly false
,
but the more jakob tells hte people of the ghetto this
, the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate
. the danger
, of course
, is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto
,
and rumors about the radio can get out
and put jakob in great danger
. in a curiously irrelevant subplot
, jakob finds a 11
- year old girl who hasnt seperated from her parents
and decides to hide her in his small home
. apparently he is afraid that she will be dicovered
,
and goes to great length to make sure of that
-
- just why the diea frightens him is never made claer
. he
and the girl build an uninvolving
, generic relationship that never goes anywhere
and is as irrelevant at thge end as it was in the beginning
. the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine
.
but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false
. such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization
and when those expectations aren
' t met
, the results are far worse than if there was no hope
. that
' s the film
' s biggest detriment
: it is based on a false assumption
and thus comes off as painfully false
. it
' s never moving because it doesn
' t give us anything to be moved by
. jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing
. robin williams doesn
' t inject the film with life
, as a matter of fact
, he seems a little outloud ofthe it
, as if crippled by his fake accent
. he is stragely unenthusiastic
; his character is one who spreads hope
but his performance is lifeless
, hopeless
. not since good will hunting has he ab
andoned his signature sytle to this extent
; tihs isn
' t teh robin williams we know
and love
. in good will hunting he became a serious actor
and won an oscar for it
. here
, he isnt more of a wannabe serious actor
; an impostor
. jakob the liar will be compared with last year
' s life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a
" holocaust comedy
"
. it
' s not a comedy
. it tries
, sometimes
,
but it rarely works
. is it a melodrama
? a war movie
? a character study
? no
, no
,
and no
. jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can
' t be placed into a category
; not because it covers so many different genres
but because it fails at just baout every one it attemts
.
