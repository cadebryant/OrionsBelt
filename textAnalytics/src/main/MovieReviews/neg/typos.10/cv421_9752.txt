the cartoon is way better
. that ' s the bottom line on disney ' s incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature
. the alliance between disney
and slapstick king john hughes hasnt produced a frenetic
" home alone
" with puppies
,
and not much else
. wehn production of this remake was announced
, the big question seemed to be
" why
? the original cartoon still works
, so whta ' s the point
?
" the answer
, it appears
, is to give disney an excuse for
yet anyother massive merchandising campaign
. the story
, for those of you who missed childhood
, is simple
. two dalmatians
, pongo
and perdy
, fall in love at first sight
. tehy drag their
" human pets
" toghether
,
and in a short time both couples marry
. the heavenly match
- ups turn chaotic when pongo
and perdy ' s new
- born pups are stolen
; their dog
- napping engineered by the evil cruella devil
, who wants them for their pelts
. everyone in the animal kingdom
then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies
. in the original movie
, the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions
and distict personalities
. we also could hear them talk
, which quicklyu established a crucial element to the charm of the film
, the dog ' s view of humans as their pets
. in the new version
, the dogs are mute
and expressionless
. hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping theri heads over each other
and licking theri faces
and necks
. while he drew the desired
" aww
, they ' re so cute
" reaction from the audience
, it was quickly folowed by severeal people whispering
" i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog ' s heads to get them licking like that
?
" the canines ' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little
. joely richardson
and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles
. in previous films
, daniels successfully played off his white bread persona
. iin
" something wild
"
, he revealed tyhe rebellious thrill
- seeker beneath his neutral demeanor
. in
" terms of endearment
"
, his hapless appearance masked a cold
, manipulative womanizer
. here
, he
and richardson are so consistently bland thgat it ' s a wonder their images even stick to the film
. glenn close
,
however
, has no problems establishing a distinct personality
. as thge villainous icon cruella devil
, she tears up the screen in a deliciously over
- the
- top performance
. close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a ctaroon herself
. with a two
- tone fright wig
, red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips
, garish animal skin outfits
and stiletto heels
, close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature
. she ' s clearly having a ball playing htis monstrous icon
,
and her wicked glee is infectious
. when she spits out lines liek
" you ' ve won the battle
,
but i ' m about to win the wardrobe
!
,
" the film comes briefly to life
.
" 101 dalmatians
" is crammed with john hughes ' typical heavy
- handed aproach tothe comedy
. after an ingenuous opening showing pongo ' s morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day
, the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park
. a little slapstick goes a long way
,
but hughes just keeps laying it on
. the second half of the film
, where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil
anbd her henchmen
, is a tedeous home alone clone
, with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy
& scratchy cartoon
, including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence
.
" 101 dalmatians
" has cute puppies
and a hoot of a performance from glenn close
,
but not anough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick
, bland characters
,
and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high
- fiving one another
. rent the cartoon
