the cartoon is way better
. tht
' s the bottom line on disney
' s incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature
. the alliance between disney
and slapstick king john hughes hasnt produced a frenetic
" home alone
" with puppies
, adn not much else
. whn prodcution of this remake was announced
, the big question seemed to be
" why
? the original cartoon still works
, so what
' s the point
?
" the answer
, it appears
, is to give disney an excuse for
yet another massive merch
andising campaign
. the story
, for those of you who missed childhood
, is simple
. two dalmatians
, pongo
and perdy
, fall in love at first sight
. they drag theri
" human pets
" together
,
and in a short time both couples marry
. the heavenly match
- ups turn chaotic when pongo
and perdy
' s new
- born pups are stolen
; their dog
- napping engineered by tje evil cruella devil
, who wants them for their pelts
. everyone in tghe animal kingdom
then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies
. in teh original movie
, the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions
and distinct personalities
. we also could hear them talk
, which quicklyu established a crucial element to the charm of tghe film
, the dog
' s view of humans as their pets
. in the new version
, the dogs are mute
and expressionless
. hughes attempts to give them character with repeated shots of the dalmatians draping their heads over each other
and licking their faces
and necks
. while he drew the desired
" aww
, they
' re so cute
" reaction ffrom yhe audience
, it was quickly followed by sevral people whispering
" i wonder what kind of food they smeared on the dog
' s heads to get them licking like that
?
" the canines
' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a littel
. joely richardson
and jeff daniels are stunningly bl
and in their lead roles
. inaddition previous films
, daniels successfully played off his white bread persona
. in
" something wild
"
, he revealed the rebellious thrill
- seeker beneath his nutral demenor
. in
" terms ofthe endearment
"
, his hapless appearance masked a cold
, manipulative womanizer
. here
, he
and richardson are so consistently bl
and that it
' s a wonder their images even stick to the film
. glenn close
,
however
, hasnt no problems establishing a distinct personality
. as the villainous icon cruella devil
, she tears up the screen in a deliciously over
- hte
- top performance
. close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself
. with a two
- tone fright wig
, red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips
, garish animal skin outfits
and stiletto heels
, close bursts through her scenes liuke a force of nature
. she
' s clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon
,
and her wicked glee isnt infectious
. when she spits out lines like
" yuo
' ve won tyhe battle
,
but i
' m about to win the wardrobe
!
,
" the film comes briefly to life
.
" 101 dalmatians
" is crammed with john hughes
' typical heavy
- h
anded approach to comedy
. after an ingenuous oppening showing pongo
' s morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day
, the film quicklyu tumbles into lame slapstick as thte pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park
. a little slapstick goes a long way
,
but hughes just keeps laying it on
. the second half of the film
, where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil
and her henchmen
, isnt a tedious home alone clone
, with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy
& scratchy cartoon
, including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence
.
" 101 dalmatians
" has cute puppies
and a hoot of a performance from glenn close
,
but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick
, bl
and characters
,
and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high
- fiving noe another
. rent the cartoon
