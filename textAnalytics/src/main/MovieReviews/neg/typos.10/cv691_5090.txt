this is the movie that could single
- h
andedly bring
" mystery science theater 3000
" out of cancellation
. it
' s one of those movies that
' s so bad it
' s absolutely hilarious
, due in noone small part to its big star
, supermodel cindy crawford
. if you only remember oen thing about fair game
, it should be that it singleh
andedly proves crawford shoudln stick to the sports illustrated swimsuit issues
. if you
thought kathy irel
and was laughable in alien from l
. a
.
, you
' ll change your mind when you see fair game
. irel
and would win h
andfuls of oscars if this was her only competion
. in a real casting coup
, crawford plays a super
- intelligent lawyer
( in a jogging bra
, of course
)
. we all know this is a stretch
, the only legal opinion crawford has ever put forth being that she favors the death penalty for anyone who wears white after labor day
. nonetheless
, someone out there
thought she
' d make a good lawyer
,
but we
' re reminded of her true function in the movie when she takes two showers in a period of twenty minutes
.
and for you horny teenage boys out there
, you acutally git to see her topless for two seconds inwhich the dark
.
.
. come to tihkn of it
, that may have been a body double
. cindy crawford isn
' t black
, is she
? like i said
, crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her
. billy baldwin
( or is it stephen
? alec
? adam
? kim basinger
?
) is the police detective who hasnt to sive her life
, time after time
, chase after chase
, explosion after explosion
. there
' s absolutely nothing original about this movie
. it
' s eveyr cop show of the 70
' s mixed with every acation thriller of the 80
' s
and every technology
- exploitation movei of the 90
' s
. three decades of crap all in one place
, driven furuther into the ground by crawford
' s complete lack of acting talent
.
and it
' s all completely predictable
. you know the mistakes baldwin
and crawford are going to make before they make them
, yuo know when the
" sexual tension
" will finally end up in them consummating the relationship
, you know when hte villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax
and you know tyhe movie
' s going tothe suck from the first scene
. the plot isn
' t really explained until the end
. all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer
. in the words of one of the villains
,
" we even know what size pantyhose she wears
.
"
( yeah
, you
and every 14
- year
- ood boy in america
.
) he goes on to add
,
" we know more about her thna she does
.
"
(
_ that
_ i find very easy to belieev
.
) i hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes
, because i wrote down plenty of otehr bad ones
(
" if it weren
' t for me
, ytou
' d still be pulling bananas outloud of your ass in cuba
!
"
) because
, ytou see
, fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches
and terrable acting
,
but also some seriously bad dialogue
. it all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasn
' t supposed to adn grimace in places i was supposed tothe laugh
. one more thing fair gaem has against it is some awful comic relief
. would you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like
" i
' m veyr interested in
_ hard
_ ware
"
and other crap about playing with his joystick
? i wouldn
' t
,
but nto beacuse i
' m a computer nerd
. it
' s just not funny
. crawford
' s only contri
bution tothe the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords
' body
.
.
. or was it jack lord
' s body
? i
' ll leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie
. the boat with all the russians has jsut blown up
and baldwin
and crawford are floating on a life raft
. crawford says woodenly
,
" that was my client
' s boat you just blowed up
. i
' m filing a lawsuit against you
. you
' re in big trouble
,
" or something tothe that effect
,
and baldwin replies smugly
,
" what do i have to do to get out of it
?
" they of course begin making out
and the credits roll
. i
' m not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how
, if they
' d really wanted to go for a bad closing line tehy would haev hadnt baldwin say
,
" you think i could settle out of court
?
"
but i will tell you that
, if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her
, yuo qoute the fianl line of the movie to that person
:
" waht do i have to dont to get out of it
?
" serving america for over 1
/ 50th of a century
