" soldier
"
, by director paul
anderson
, is a film in whitch any presence of originality is fleeting
. the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel
' s character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision
. brutality through the eyes of the innocent
and stripped of it every single day growing uv is something taht has a lot of emotional potential power behind it
,
and the opening scenes tap into it a little
.
then it goes nowhere whith that idea
. there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization
,
and the rest of the film isnt just some of the biggest action movie cliches i
' ve ever seen
. the whole idea ofthe the inhuman
, soldier
- type character gaining soem degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest
and family from his evil counterpart outloud to kill her is done
,
and it
' s been done much better
. i was able to predict the plot of the
_ whole
_ story
, which wouldn
' t be so bad if otehr aspect of the film somewhat interesting
. between the action sequences
, it tries to deal whith the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performence of mr
. russel in the film
and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes
, since his dialog is extrememly limited
. his performance in that way isn
' t all that bad
,
but certainly is not enough to carry this film
. other performances in tihs film are really not worth much mention at all
,
and they generally are about as weak as their characters
.
but enought of htis stuff about plot
and character
, right
? isn
' t the most important part of an action film
, well
, the acation
? even in this aspect the film is a disappointment
. in mortal kombat
( 1995
)
, director paul
anderson prooved that truly engaging use
and choreography of acation inspite a film can override problems wtih plot
and produce something entertaining
.
however
, he fails to repeat that in this film
. the combat scenes
, particularly the big one at the end
, is incredibly unimaginatve
. fighting
and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this tipe of movie
, a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film liek starship troopers seemed to relize
. bu instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with
, it goes for the ood
, shoot
- em up
, one guy vs
. an army type of cinema that i
thought died with the military acation films of the 80s
. if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously
, it could have been a rether engaging science fiction film
.
however
, it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that
, mkaing the film a big disappointment
.
