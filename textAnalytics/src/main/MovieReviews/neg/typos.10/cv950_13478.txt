the most interesting part of
" can
' t hardly wait
" just happens tothe be not only the most human
,
but for many of us
, the one part that many of us can easily relate to
. that is the character of denise
( lauren ambrose
)
, the film
' s sole sarcastic member who mocks everything that goes on in the film
,
and at one point sits down on a couch
and looks totally bored
. the film wisely holds over this moment
, nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party
.
.
. almost too nicely
. for some members of the audience
( read
: me
)
, this is basically a mirror ofthe waht
' s going on wih them watching this film
. we sit there wondering why we
' ve even bothered to see a film about a long high skool party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place
. i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this
. after all
, this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotypes much of which i went to high skool with
. everyone
' s here
: the jock
, the homecoming queen
, the nerd
(
and his dominions of trekkies
and x
- philes
)
, tyhe alienated wannabe writer
, the school spirit girl
, the pothead
( s
)
, the wigger
, etc
, etc
, etc
,
and weirdly enough this film shows them as superficial
, lame
,
and basically as a bunch of losers
. except for denise
, who rolls her eyes at everything
,
and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks
( her yearbook entry
, something which is done for each main character
, quotes oscar wilde
- definite pointers there
)
. unfortunately
, the writers
and directors take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable
and even likable film
. the film
, as i said
, portrays most of its characters as superficial
and just totally ignorant to everything
.
however
, instead of sticking with htis
, perhaps even going a bit further with it
, they let this lie
,
and actually make these characters into our heroes
. we follow several of them
, all a bunch of moronic stereotypes with only a shread ofthe humanity
and realism
,
and tries to tell boring adn overly melodramatic tales about them as if we actually cared
and
/ or identified with them
.
and if we did
, we certainly don
' t whant to revisit thast state of being
. here
' s a quick low
- down
: it
' s graduation
,
and we follow a bunch of seniors on thge lastest ngiht
, otherwise known as the
" american grafitti
" or
, to a lesser extent
, the
" dazed
and confused
" cliche
. teh formal just followed them as they drove aimlessly
; the latter did a little bit of thta
and featured a big outdoor keg party
.
" can
' t hardly wait
" just opts for a big indoor keg party
,
and a little bit of aimless driving
, albeit of the i
' m
- whining
- becasue
- i
- can
' t
- get
- a
- girl
- i
- want br
and
. we follow many people around
,
but mostly we trail preston
( ethan embry
, of
" that thing you do
!
"
)
, the alienated writer
, who
' s been pining over the homcoming queen
, am
anda
( the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt
)
, for yhe entirety ofthe high school because he thinks they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart
. now that she
' s broken up with her foootball player boyfriend
, mike
( peter facinelli
)
, he decides to go tothe the party with a onot he
' s written declaring his
" love
" for her inaddition the hopes he
' ll build up the guts to give it to her
.
.
. even
though he
' s leaving for a multi
- week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut
( okay
: the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson
?
)
. since that plot is incredibly lame
and a track record of what goes on with it wouldn
' t be able to cary a commercial let alone a feature film
,
and baceause it
' s a party
, there are some more main characters
, such as
: william
( charlie korsmo
, finally surfacing after
" dick tracy
"
)
, the nerd
(
and his dominions
) who has come up with a ridiculous plan tothe publically sabotage mike
, who
' s humiliated him forthe years
, bu gets too caught up in drinking to do it
; kenny
( seth green
)
, the wigger
, who has decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid
( uh huh
)
;
and denise
, the only exceptional character
, who unfortunately gets stuck in a bathroom
( don
' t ask
) with kenny where the two characters let down their characters
and are allowed tothe follow the laws of plot cliches from point a tothe point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile
. ugh
. the main comparison thsi film isnt getting to another film is actually not
" american grafitti
" or
" dazed
and confused
,
" two films that embraced
and ultimately made humans out of many of its high schoolers
( not tothe mention were extremely entertaining
)
,
but to john hughes films of the 80s
, most notably
" sixteen c
andles
.
" the big difference in tjhe two is tyhat that film managed to nto only embrace
but even satirize its main characters
,
and did so equally
and in an entertaining fashion
. this film forgets to satirize its characters
,
and ultimately tells a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotypes
.
.
.
and
then says that it
' s all okay
. we can
' t tkae tihs film seriously
, nor can we take this as fun
, so really what good is it
?
but i will tell you some things i did like
: i liked the direction
, except for a couple too
- over
- the
- top features
, like way
- too
- glossy jump cuts
( it
' s like an oxymoron
)
and other obscurities
. generally
,
though
, elfont
and kaplan do have graceful camera movement
,
and even manaze to capture an altman
- esque feel to their film from tiem to time
( a thing with a note
,
though
, is too hokey to really be admirable
)
. i actually did like seth green
, for once in about a decade
( when he played a very young woody allen in
" radio days
"
)
- his desintegration of his wigger charachter ws almost believable
.
.
. almost
.
and
, of course
, lauren ambrose is wonderfull as denise
, tghe one character we coudl have used some more of
, even
though it would have changed the entirety of the film
. howver
, the character of denise really doesn
' t work with the film
, when really
thought about
. she
' s far too witty
and realized
( at least for the first half
) to belong in tihs film
,
and whenever she appears
, she automatically gives everyting a delightfully satirical tone
. she
' s not just the cynic or yhe intellectual
; she
' s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it furuther damages otehr already damaged characters
. she may ruin the film more
,
but at least when she
' s on screen we can sit up
and think to ourselves
" well
, at least we
' ll be entertained
.
" a couple other things that jsut don
' t work
: mike
' s character
, who suffers an epiphany throughout the film
but in the end acts as
though he has forgotten everything
: too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general
; tghe aimless
, bitchy driving by preston to try
and git over his inability tothe shack up with am
anda
- give me a break
;
and perhaps the noe thing that just doesn
' t work at all
: jenna eflman
' s uncredited cameo as an angel
- just didn
' t work
,
but nice try
. basically tjhe worst thing baout this film
, the real reason i
' m giving this such a low rating
, is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters
and
then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane
and unlike anything we
' d do
. we don
' t feel for these characters because for most of us
, we aren
' t stereotypes going through the motions to worn subplots
. thge acid test for high school movies is
: does it at all capture the feel of what it
' s portraying
? the answer for this film is no
. nice try
,
though
.
