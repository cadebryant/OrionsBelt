" spawn
" features good guys
, bad guys
, lots ofthe fighting
, bloody violence
, a leather
- clad machine gun chick
, gooey
, self
- healing bullet holes
, scatological humor
and a man
- eating monster
. it nto only appears to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12
-
and 13
- year
- old boys
, it appears to have been made by them
. in a classic exemple of telling
and not showing
,
" spawn
" opens with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forces of darkness
, forces of light
and how
" men are the ones who create evil on earth
.
" so much for a message
. the movie
then lurches forward into the plight of al simmons
( michael jai white
)
, a government assasins
/ operative who is murdered by diabolical boss jason wynn
( martin sheen
, who plays all of his scenes like an oscar clip
) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biological weapons plant
. simmons goes to hell
and back
, aftter making a deal with satan himself
-
- if he agrees to comm
and the devil
' s army to overtake the world
, he
' ll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife w
anda
( underused theresa r
andle
) anbd little girl cyan
( sydni beaudoin
)
. of course
, seeing as how five years has pasted
, w
anda has fallen for
-
-
and married
-
- simmons
' partner
( d
. b
. sweeney
)
. his
, uh
, shoulder to cry on comes in the form of clown
( john leguizamo
)
, a disgustingly disproportioned minion of satan
' s
. clown manipulates simmons
, now in superhuman spawn form
, into a st
and off with wynn
. wynn
, who thinks he is in league with the double
- dealing clown
, recognizes spawn as a threat
and undergoes an operation where a bomb is placed on his heart
-
- when it stops beating
, major cities around the world will detonate
, causing the leak of a disease that
" mkaes the ebola virus look like a skin rash
.
" phew
. got all that
? it would be easy to dismiss
" spawn
" as just another one of those heavy
- onthe
- fx
, short
- on
- substace action pics
,
but it doesn
' t even work on that level
. the computer
- generated sequences are often
and plenty
,
and the problem is that they look too cmoputer
- generated
. the several scenes set infact hell present a devil that looks annd acts like a video game graphic
-
- wih the movie
' s healthy budget you
' d think they coudl have afforded to make his mouth move whn he talks
. other elements of the movie are so
- so
; spawn
' s enormass red
, flowing cape is a wonderful sight
,
but it
' s too obvious when he
' s being played by a costumed actor or an image
. in movies like
" contact
,
" the special effects serve the story
. in
" spawn
,
" they are the stroy
.
and spawn himself isn
' t even an interesting charcter
. the film
' s reliance on razzle
- dazzle would be acceptable if we were given somebody to root for
, bu both simmons
and his funky alter
- ego are completely underdeveloped
. what we need is a batman
, a luke skywalker
. even watching the adventures of kleenex man would be more interesting than spawn
. poor leguizamo
. he starred in febuary
' s
" the pest
,
" a movie tath i still think is the year
' s worst so far
, altho this one doens give it a run for its money
. as clown
, he overacts to the extreme
, never missing an opportunity for a poor
- taste punchline
. leguizamo farts green mist
, munches a pizza slice covered with maggots annd even dons a mini
- skirt adn performs a cheerleader routine
, all before turning into a giant grey demon
. the guy was brilliant in
" to wong foo
, thanks for everything
! julie newmar
.
" waht is he doing wasting his talent in this annd
" the pest
"
? i
' m one of yhe few people that liked
" batman
& robin
,
" this summer
' s other big
- budget comic book film
.
yet after catching this movie
and making the inevitable comparison
, i can only hope people will change their minds
and think of
" batman
" as the superior adaptation
. there
' s a compelling story somewhere in
" spawn
"
-
- including storng religious overtones
and the de
but of thge first african
- american superhero ever
-
-
but it
' s jsut not found anyhwere near here
. as it is
,
" spawn
" isnt just awful
-
- it stinks worse than a dead trout
.
