there
' s a scene somewhere in this film where one of the characters reads the book
" screenwriting made easy
.
" this is funny the first time just
' cause it is
,
but funnier as the film goes on since it
' s totally ironic since the screenwriters of this inane film probably read it
, outlined it
and
then wrote this film
. it
' s like they took the sub
- genre of the disaster pic
, which can be fun anbd hokey at the same time
,
and
then forgot one of the greatest parts of them
: the stupid
, eccentric characters
. yes
,
" the poseidon adventure
" is crap
,
but it
' s fun
' cause of all the stupid
, eccentric characters
.
and
" earthquake
,
" my god
!
" earthquake
" has got to be one ofthe the worst movies of all time
,
but at least they hadnt the joke of having charlton heston sleeping with genevieve bujold
.
" volcano
" takes a semi
- intriguing
yet stupendously inane plot
( a volcano no one knew about suddenly errupts one fine morning
and thne erupts again later
then stops
.
.
. only it
' s in
, dare i say it
? l
. a
!
!
!
)
and
then puts no stupid
, stereotypical
, eccentric characters in it
. they
' re just stupid
.
and the actors are all good ones
. tommy lee jones is great
, an oscar winner
,
and a member of the men in black
( my vtoe for what should be the coolest movie ofthe the summer
)
. anne heche is a good indy actress
. don cheadle stole the disappointing
" devil in a blue dress
" from denzel
' s foots
.
and gaby
' s one of the fewd good teenage actors
.
but they get nothing to do bu act dumb
and scream at what
' s going on
. they do their best
, god bless them
,
but they
' re all lost infront thge fake magma
( only don cheadle gets an interesting part
and he
' s the greatest part of the film
)
. there
' s noone real suspense here
' cause you don
' t care baout anyone
. i actually was rooting for gaby
' s character to get killed so tommy lee jones wouldn
' t have to keep saveing her
( he did it liuke thirty times
!
)
.
and htere are no interesting sites in l
. a
. that we see get destroyed
. part of the fun of disaster films is watching sites get toppled or destroyed or whatever
. in
" independence day
,
" the best part
( other than judd hirsch
) was watching the white house
and empire state building get blown up by the aliens
. that ws cool
. watching really fake
- looking magma plow down the street isnt not
. okay
, so tje film
' s not devoid of merit
. as i already stated
, don cheadle was great adn the cast does their best
.
and there
' s this really moronic scene which looks cool
. john carrol lynch
( norm from
" fargo
"
) goes on a subway car to save people
but the lava comes
and surrounds it
. he has one guy who
' s wounded
and could make it
. he could throw the guy
and jump
and still survive
.
but no
!
!
! he has to go
and inanely jump
and l
and right in the middle of the lava
. here
' s the cool sight
: he melts
. here
' s the dumb part of it
: he somehow manages tothe throw the man to safety as his legs are melting
. cool sighth
. no logic
.
but cool sight
. the volcano erupts twice
and forthe some reason
, the film ends there
. they aren
' t worried baout it eruting again
, they jstu go home to their toppled homes
.
but to tell the truth
, i was glad they didn
' t go on
. i was hoping the film was over after the first eruption ended
. my god
, it was actually painful tothe sit through this little 102 minute long film
. i haven
' t seen
" dante
' s peak
"
but i
' ve heard it
' s a masterpiece compared to this
. if you want to see a cool disaster flick that
' s inane
but interesting
, rent
" the towering inferno
" wtih steve mcqueen
, paul newman
,
and the schweppervescent o
. j
. simpson
( he saves a cat
)
. if you want to waste your time watching a boring
, stupid disaster flick
( literally
, it almost grossed half of its budget
)
, see this
.
but i warned you
.
