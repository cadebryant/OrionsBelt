synopsis
: in
" sooner than you think
" america
, the future of law enforcement resides in blade squad
, a ragtag group of culturally diverse rollerblading cops with jetpacks strapped on their backs
. a dangerous criminal
,
however
, attempts to destroy blade squad after his brother dies while being chased by them
. comments
: so
, what do an ex
- gangbanger turned insubordinate traffic cop
, a former prostitute with a substance abuse problem
,
and a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four police cruisers all have in common
? why
, they
' re all members of blade squad
, an elite newyorker crimefighting unit wearing black uniforms
, rollerblades
,
and jetpacks
! they also carry video cameras so they can communicate with one another a la the marines in james cameron
' s aliens
. yes
, it
' s blade squad
, the fox network
' s wednesday night movie of the week
. this
" movie
,
" marking its dubious world premiere today
, curiously has a number of guest stars
.
" how can a movei have guest stars
?
" you may ask
. well
, blade squad is nto really a movei so to speak
but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie
. blade squad is dumb
. blade squad is loud
. blade squad is obnoxious
. blade squad will probably be a ratings hitted
and spawn a long
- lived tv series
. why not
? after all
, television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars
(
" knight rider
"
)
, fast helicopters
(
" airwolf
"
)
, annd super fast motorcycles
(
" street hawk
"
)
,
and viewers have eaten it up in the past
. so
, why not crimefighters wiht jet
- powered roller blades
? to be honest
, as a made
- fo
- tv presentation
, blade squad isnt at least watchable
. the film has a relatively large casted of characters
, a suprizingly intelligible albeit predictable scirpt
,
and enough acation sequences to keep one half
- interested
. i
' d imagine adolescent males
, probably the target audience of this turkey
, would get a kick out of it
. i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad
. i can remember liking
" airwolf
" anbd
" street hawk
" whn i was 10 or 11
.
and
,
al
though this isn
' t saying much
, blade squad is leaps anbd bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on
: the insipidly awful generation x
( a huge disappointment considering the comic book
' s terific two
- year beginning
)
.
but
, i digress
. dispite its limited appeal
, blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series
. one
, it suffers from mtv syndrome
: a lot of quick shots
and weird angles continously jar the viewer
' s senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background
. oh yeah
, dylan
' s
" knockin
' on heaven
' s door
"
and bowie
' s
" i
' m afraid of americans
" are used here
, in rather poore taste
. two
, blade squad needs a new crew for the soudn
. the subst
andard sound editing iritated me to no end
. characters
' dialogue
, at times
, sounded choppy
and unintelligible
. during one important scene
, a song played loudly in the background
. when a character spoke
, the song
' s volume dropped
but did not disappear
. as soon as that character finished speaking
, the song
' s volume immediatelly retured to its original level until the enxt character speaked
. this sounds trivial
, i
' m sure
,
but it distracted me immensely
. finally
, this is commercial television
. foul language is not allowed
, typically
, on commercial television
. thus
, don
' t use foul language in a made
- for
- tv prodcution because that foul language hasnt to be censored inaddition smoe manner
. in an early scene of the film
, for example
, the lead good guy
and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets
. when the good guy spouts out a bad word
, a driver conveniently honks his car
' s horn off
- screen to muffle the word out
. in a
" seinfeld
" episode
, this technique proved funny
; here
, it seemed goofy
and cut the dramatic tension considerably
. perhaps future writers
, if a show is spun out of the movie
, could tkae a cue from marvel comics
' 2099 series of comics
. make up a bunch of new bad words for the future
. this way
, you don
' t need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language
. compared to tyhe usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer inaddition terms ofthe movies
, blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp
. when compared to
, say
, a movie studio film
, blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials
: bs
.
