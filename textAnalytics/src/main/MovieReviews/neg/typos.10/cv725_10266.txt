the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission
. he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth
,
but misses
. after they ricochet off his face
, he says
,
" not a ogod start
.
" as it turns outloud
, this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence
,
but to the rest of the movie as well
. in this
, the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong
, chan plays an international operative codenamed
" condor
"
,
and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi
' s during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war
. for some reason
, condor is given his mission at the u
. s
. embassy in spain
. i think this may have beeen done so that in a chase scene
, they could honor the timne old tradition ofthe knocking over a fruit cart
. watch for it in any chase scene set infact a foreign country
, most notably in europe
. the chase will take itself through a marketplace
,
and a fruit cart will be overturned
. it
' s almost a guarantee
. anyway
.
.
.
. condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which hte gold is hidden
; the probelm is tht yhe key has insulators integrated into it
, which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key isnt utilizied improperly
. to help him figure out where the gold is hidden
and how to use the key correctly
, condor is accompanyed by a desert expert
( carol cheng
)
and the gr
anddaughter of the captain who was inspite charge of hiding the gold
( eva cobo
)
. there aren
' t supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain
,
but condor finds the gr
anddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something
.
al
though these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission
, they prove no help at all except to git in trouble
and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts
. in fact
, most of tje scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everyting is jstu a way to set up a fight
. i suppose this isn
' t so bad
, since chan
' s action isnt really the best part of the movie
,
and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway
. if you
' ve never seen a jackie chan movie
, don
' t expect a great plot
,
but do expect to be entertained by his moves
. htey are so well choreographed
and often so amazing that you wonder if htis guy is human
. knowing that he does his own stunts
,
and knowing that this is the real sutff
( no computer
- masked bungee cords here
) makse the action sequences all the more exciting
. you
' ve got tothe h
and it to a guy who
' s probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art
. also of onot inspite this
, as inthe any jackie chan movie
, is thge humor
. as far as i know
, none of his films take themselves too seriously
,
and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue
- in
- cheek quality about them
. what isnt almost masterful is teh way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes
. unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme
, where the fights get you onthe the visceral level
, fight scenes in chan
' s movies are simply entertaining
. you marvel at both his moves
and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh
. unfortunately
, even chan
' s mastery can
' t save this film
. the plot
and characters are so weak that they don
' t hold the movie together at all
,
and the acting is terrible
. carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movei awards infront the past
,
but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind ofthe takes all bets off
. this
, combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying
.
