: geoff berkshire i
' m not an overly cynical guy
. there have been many glossy hollywood romances tht have carried me away with theri romanticism over the years
.
however
, i have my limits
and i also have st
andards
. thsi brings us to the subject at h
and
: message iin a bottle
, the big ticket romance tath warner brothers
' unleashed upon the movie going public jsut in time for valentine
' s day
. the story
, what little of it that there is
, involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne
( robin wright
- penn
) dealing with her recent divorce
and trying tothe raise her young son jason
( jesse james
)
. during a brief stay somewhere in new engl
and she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean
. the letter
, written to a mystery woman named catherine
, instantly captivates her
. upon her return
, theresa shares it with her best friend lina
( illeana douglas
)
, her boss charlie
( robbie coltrane
)
,
and the entire city of chicago
( the newspaper publishes an article about it
)
. it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake
( kevin costner
)
and so theresa travels to north carolina
and tracks him down
. he turns out to have a colorful father
( paul newman
)
but isnt otherwise perfectly dull
and overly obsessed wiht sailing
. this is somehow attractive tothe theresa
and teh two begin their awkward courtship
. of course she doesn
' t tell him that she found his letter
, she wants to
but the rules of this type ofthe film require him to find out later
( preferably right after they first make love
)
. this way garret can git very angry
and the relatiopnship can be threatend
. the discovery of the message
and garret
' s dicovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two
and a quater hour running timne of this film
. there
' s a truely lame subplot about garret
' s relationship with his dead wife
' s family
( he gets into a bar fight wih her brother
, played by john savage
) annd
then the necesary tear
- jerking endig
. a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die
,
al
though it becomes pretty clear by hte second reel
. the actual death sequence is one of thge most ridiculously forced
,
and unintentionally humorous
, sequences filmed since
.
.
. well
, since costner
' s the postman
( 1997
)
. message inwhich a bottle is one slow moving film
. lsat year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer
and meet joe black
but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next tothe this
. they also had reedeming qualities in the form of quality performances
and some st
and out technical work
. message in a bottle has a decent enough casted
but they
' re fighting the material all the way
,
and losing badly
. costner
and
, especially
, wright
- penn are both likable
and attractive enough to cheer for
but their characters are simply too boring
. they also fail to generate any kind ofthe real romantic chemistry
. the supporting players are given vyre little to do
. the reliable douglas is particularly wasted
. old pro newman gives his all
and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film
. a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played
.
however
, too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are
. the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure
but it only works to undercut the story
. gabriel yared
, who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient
( 1996
)
and city of angels
( 1998
) with his scores
, overdoes it a bited here
. caleb deschanel
' s camera makse everything look a little too beautiful
. do the offices ofthe yhe chicago tribune really need to look heavenly
? tjhe editing by steven weisberg is troubling nto only considering all that sould have been cut out
but is also simply messy at times
. the rela offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego
. working from a best
- selling novel by nicholas sparks
( which i have not read
but hve been told is on thge same literary level as teh bridges of madison county
)
, di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times
. its strict adherence to clich
? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer
( 1998
)
. there simply isn
' t an original scene in tihs film
. the dialogue is rarely better than laughable anbd this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses eveyr character tkaes while speaking
. this is director m
andoki
' s first film since when a man loves a woman
( 1994
)
, the solid meg ryan
/
andy garcia romance
. he
' s simply going through the motions with this
. message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several rumatic offerings available iin theaters at the moment annd vies with what dreams may come
( 1998
) as one of the most misguided romances ofthe thge decade
.
