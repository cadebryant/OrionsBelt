. review by
: geoff berkshire i ' m nto an overly cynical guy
. there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away withthe their romanticism over the years
.
howver
, i have my limits
and i also have standards
. this brings us to the subject at hand
: message in a bottle
, the big ticket romance that warner brothers ' unleashed upon tyhe movie going public just in time for valentine ' s day
. the story
, what little of it that htere is
, involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne
( robin wright
- penn
) dealing with her recent divorce
and trying to raise her young son jason
( jesse james
)
. durig a brief stay somewhere infront new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean
. the letter
, writed to a mystery woman named catherine
, instantly captivates her
. upon her return
, theresa shares it with her best friend lina
( illeana douglas
)
, her boss charlie
( robbie coltrane
)
,
adn the entire city of chicago
( the newspaper publishes an article baout it
)
. it turns outloud that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake
( kevin costner
)
and so theresa travels to north carolina
and tracks him down
. he turns out to have a colorful father
( paul newman
)
bu isnt otherwise perfectly dull
anbd overly obsessed with sailing
. this is somehow attractive to theresa
and the two begin their ackward courtship
. of course she doesn ' t tell him that she found his letter
, she wants to
but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later
( preferrably right after they first make love
)
. this way garret can get vyre angry
and the relationship can be threatened
. the discovery of the message
and garret ' s discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two notewothy events that happen during the nearly two
adn a quarter hour running tiome of this film
. there ' s a truly lame subplot about garret ' s relationship with his dead wife ' s family
( he gets into a bar fight with her brother
, played by john savage
)
and
then thte necessary tear
- jerking ending
. a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die
,
although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel
. the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced
,
and unintentionally humorous
, sequences filmed since
.
.
. well
, since costner ' s the postman
( 1997
)
. message in a bottle is one slow moving film
. last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer
and meet joe black
but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this
. they alsot had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances
and some stand out technical work
. message in a bottle has a decent enough cast
but they ' re fighting the material all the way
,
and losing badly
. costner
and
, especially
, wright
- penn are both likable
and attractive enough to cheer for
but their characters are simply too boring
. they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry
. tjhe supporting players are given very little to dont
. the reliable douglas is particularly wasted
. old pro newman gives his all
and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film
. a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played
.
however
, too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are
. the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure
but it only works to undercut the sotry
. gabriel yared
, who previously set the romantic moods of yhe english patient
( 1996
)
adn city of angels
( 1998
) with his scores
, overdoes it a bited here
. caleb deschanel ' s camera makse everything look a little too beautiful
. do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly
? the editting by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out
but is alsot simply messy at times
. teh real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego
. working from a best
- selling novel by nicholas sparks
( which i have not read
but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county
)
, di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times
. its strict adherence to clich
? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer
( 1998
)
. there simpley isn ' t an original scene in this film
. the dialogue is rarely better than laughable
and htis is onyl accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking
. this is director mandoki ' s first film usance when a man loves a woman
( 1994
)
, thte solid meg ryan
/ andy garcia romance
. he ' s simply going through the motions with this
. message in a bottle is easily the worst of teh sevral romantic offerings available in theaters at hte moment
and vies with what dreams may come
( 1998
) as one of tghe most misguided romances of the decade
.
