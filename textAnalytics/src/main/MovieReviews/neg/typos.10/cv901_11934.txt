renee zellweger stars as sonia
, a young jewish wife
and mother frustrated by the constaints of her hasidic community in brooklyn
. her husband
( glenn fitzgerald
) is a religious scholar whose all
- in
- a
- day ' s
- work attitude on sex fails to tame the
" fire
" she feels within
, as so she confesses to tghe rebbe
( after hearing her fiery confession
, the rebbe suddenly gets frisky with his pleasantly surprised wife
-
-
and dies the next morning
)
. sensing her frustration
, her husband ' s brother
( christopher eccleston
) gives her a job in his jewelry brokering business in exchange forthe raw
, passionless sex that just fans sonia ' s still
- burning flame
. on the job
, sonia befriends ramon
( allen payne
)
, a cool blast ofthe hunky puerto rican water who does his own jewelry designs when nto working as a grunt in an upscale jewely store
. can fire
- taming be far be that far behind for the ever
- smoldering sonia
? just about everyting in writer
- director boaz yakin ' s rings false
, starting with tjhe improbably cast zellweger
, who does an adequate enough acting job
but simply looks too waspy for thge role
. a better fit would hvea been julianna margulies
, who outshines zellweger as sonia ' s take
- no
- crap sister
- in
- law
. some of sonia ' s baby steps towrad liberation
, such as indulging in a non
- kosher egg roll in chinatown
, come off as silly
. yakin attempts to spice up the proceedings with a touch ofthe magical realism
-
- in the form of the recurring presence ofthe sonia ' s long
- dead brother ' s ghost
-
- make the story feel even more trite than it already is
.
" i didn ' t know what to expect
. it ' s like something you chase for so long
,
but
then you don ' t know how to react when you get it
. i still don ' t know how to react
.
