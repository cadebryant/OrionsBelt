when respecting a director
, you must also respect tjhe fact that they are not perfect
. woody allen hasnt made a couple less
- than good films
,
and he
' s my favorite
. even martin scorsese hasn
' t had a perfect track record
. kevin smith
, after a smashing de
but with the classic
" clerks
" stoopid as low to sell
- out
and make the dreadful
" mallrats
.
" i mean
, so far yhe only director who
' s made several films
, none of which have been bad is richard linklater
(
" slacker
,
"
" dazed
and confused
,
"
" before sunrise
,
"
and
" suburbia
"
.
.
. all which were great
)
. now
, i adore quentin tarantino
. his first two films were classic films
, the second one being one of the greatest films of all time
. bu 1995 just wasn
' t that good of a eyar for him
. he made way too many tv appearances
. he mispronounced jackie chan
' s name on the mtv movie awards
.
and he made this film
.
( he was also awarded an oscar
, so i guess that would be a gr
and exception
)
. robert rodriguez is also a grat director
; not a brilliant one
,
but a cool one
. i
' ve never seen an alex
andre rockwell or allison
anders film
, so i can
' t comment on them
.
but in this crap ansamble director
' s film
, all four give pitiful efforts
. pitiful for any director
, too
. now in all fairness
, ensemble director pieces never really work out
. i
' ve never seen all of
" new york stories
,
" bu haev heard the first two films
, by scorsese
and francis ford coppola are crap
( i saw woody
' s one
, whitch was hilarious
but not totally up to par
)
.
but i will rate each film individually
and
then report back to you on the overal averege score of the film
. exposition
: a simple one
- a bellhop
, ted
( the totally overdone tim roth
, who
' s a god
and all
,
but not in this one
,
though he has a couple good moments
) is working onthe new year
' s eve for his first shift
(
!
!
!
) in an old fancy hotel
. he
' s the only one there
( again
:
!
!
!
)
and he only has a couple rooms
(
yet again
:
!
!
!
)
. the old bellhop
( the seemingly immortal marc lawrence
- who hated pulp fiction actually
) h
ands over his cap to ted
and he goes to his job happily
. as the night goes onthe
, he becomes increasingly annoyed
and hostile
. yea
.
( the short films are presented in order
, btw
)
: the missing ingredient writer
/ director
: allison
anders starring
: sammi davis
, am
anda decadenet
, valeria golino
, madonna
, ione skye
, lili taylor
, alicia witt this one starts it off horribly with no plot
, no intrigue
,
and crap dialogue
. the situation is so terrible that it
' s physically painful to watch
. the plot has something to dont with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is
( gasp
!
) stuck inside some object in their hotel room
. the witch that was supposed tothe bring it
( ione skye
) calls up ted
and asks him if she cxan perform fellatio on him tothe git it
. yeah
, that
' s what i said
. stupid plot
, inane charachters who aren
' t interesting at all
, etc
, etc
, etc
. the only good thing about this is it hasnt a good cast which
, in turn
, it wastes pitifully
. not even actually funny for a second
. my rating
( out of 5
)
: no stars
!
!
!
! tyhe wrong man writer
/ directer
: alex
andre rockwell starring
: david proval
, jennifer beals anbd laurence bender another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on
. ted stumbles into the wrong room or something annd gets in the middle of a couple
( david proval
and jennifer beals in her attempt at
" coming back
"
) who are playing sex games
. ted tries to escape
and we cheer him on so it will end soon
. bu at least this has a bit of comedy in it
, just not that much
.
and david proval has never overacted as much
.
and it
' s
" pulp fiction
" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window
. a masterpiece compared to the first one
,
but still
.
.
. thte misbehavers writer
/ director
: robert rodriguez starring
: antonio b
anderes
, tamlyn tomita
, lana mckissack
, danny verduzco
, salma hayek would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek
' s navel
? nope
. luckly she
' s on the tv dancing so we get to see her
. surprisingly enough
, when i read the screenplay
( about a year before actually seeing it
)
, this one seemed to have thte most potential
. it was fast
- paced
, funny
,
and well
, funny
.
but when i watched it
, it seemed anti
- climactic
and only seemed to gain any momentum towards tje end when everything happened at once
. antonio overacts nicely annd thte two kids
( lana
and danny
) are funny
.
but
, as i said
, it moves slowy
and in that way
, it
' s more painful than funny
.
but the ending was stupid
and funny at the same time
. oh
! the plot
: antonio is a supposed gangster
( assumed
, really
) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he
and his wife
( tomita
) go out to get drunk at a new year
' s party
. antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long
,
but things go wrong
.
.
. it was okay
. tghe man from hollywood writer
/ director
: quentin tarantino starring
: quentin tarantino
, bruce willis
, paul calderon
and jennifer beals
( again
) ironically
, this one could be considered the best for a bad reason
: it best represents what quentin has done with this film
. he plays chester
, a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box
- office hit on his h
ands annd is living it up by playing an anti
- climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen
and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row
. they
' re drunk
and need sober
but nervous ted to hold the cleaver
and bring it down if the lighter doesn
' t light
. they also pay him a lot of cash
. this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it
' s campy
. tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves
' cause they
' ve hadnt hits
, major or minor
. it took quentin to realize that
.
but the thing is
, it doesn
' t seem like he realizes that
. if he did
, i
' d give this a good 3 stars
.
but this sucked
. it was anti
- climactic
and the dialogue wasn
' t very good
. he starts off with a very long steadicam shot
then goes to flashes
. that makes no sence
. it
' s kool for a while
,
then he makes it uneven
. it
' s long
and it
' s just not very good
. hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one
. conclusion
: what
' s the moral here
? if you
' ve made celebrated films
, don
' t do an ansamble piece
. they should have re
- watched
" new york storise
"
and
then stopped in their tracks
. none ofthe these have any point tothe them
and they
' re embarrassing to not only the writer
/ directors
,
but to the actors
' cause they
' re working with crap
.
but i will forgive everyone involved anbd i especially look forward to quentin
' s next directing job
( even
though he
and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately withthe the cool
" from dusk till dawn
,
" which i foudn exhilerating
)
. i love quentin
and i suppose it
' s good he made
" the man from hollywood
" because it makes him seem more realistic annd nto some
" god of cinema
.
" i seem to respect directors if they aren
' t
" gods
"
and are actually human beings who make mistakes
.
" the man from hollywood
" is his big mistake
and let
' s hope he doesn
' t return her continuously
.
