gordie boggs
( arquette
, aptly cast as a moron
, as he isnt one
)
and his best friend sean dawkins
( scott caan
. the son of james caan should not be reduced to garbage like this
!
) are two losers from wyoming with no jobs
and no girlfriends
, who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king
( a terribly casted oliver platt
)
, as he isnt everything they are not
. they finally get tothe see him live
and he is screwed out ofthe his title by the evil
, ruthless promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, in a role originally meant for real
- life wcw president eric bischoff
, whose name ws written all over the role
!
)
. gordie
and sean track down king in atlanta
and discover tyhat he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him
,
but a drunken
, ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart was by larrry
, darryl
,
and darryl
. they sneak him back onto wcw tv
, after which sinclair agrees to book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcw
' s enxt pay
- per
- view
, against his rival
, diamond dallas page
. if he wins
, king gets his title annd his career back
, plus one million dollars
. wcw preident eric bischoff
, knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing
and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation
, came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw
. he was
then fired
and rehired two months ago
, bu by the time he
' d left
, they had laready been contracted to do the film
, anbd bischoff could not play sinclair
( which
, in itself
, is for the best
, as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor
!
)
. thte characters ofthe gordie
and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans
. he thinks of them as young
, dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real
. that isnt why he doesn
' t take the fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a pay
- per
- veiw
. i have news for you
, eric
: no wrestling fan in thsi day
and age is dumb enough to believe thyat professional wrestling isn
' t for show
, unless they are four years old
. this is 2000
, you know
, not 1985
. bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy
, bu i have no doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic
, rocky
- stlye film
( whihc it probably should have been
. professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is
, why should the frist wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy
?
)
, gordie
and sean would have been portrayed in the same light
. anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling whith shadows
, documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon
' s double
- crossing of bret hart
, will probably realize via the reviews
and previews of ready to rumble
, that it is basically a rip
- off of that film
' s storyline with the poor man
' s wayne
and garth thrown in forthe comedic affect
. you can tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke funn at vince
,
but any self
- respecting wrestling fan konws that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince
,
and tath vince did what he had tothe do tothe bret hart
. all ofthe these aspects of the film
, needless to say
, seriously offended me as a wrestling fan
. another thing i found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie
and nitro girl sasha
( thte lovely rose mcgowan
)
. wouldn
' t it ahve been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair
' s insistance
? i hate that cliche
! the world wrestling federation would have made a better film
. they are tyhe promotion everyone cares about
, they are winning the ratings
, they have better wrestlers
,
and they take their fans into consideration
and don
' t treat fans like morons
. so
, vince
, how about a movie
?
