if you
' re into watching near on two hours of bored
, foul
- mouthed florida teens having sex
, doing drugs
, having sex
, listening to eminem
, haveing sex
, playing video games
, having sex
,
and killing one of their peers
,
then
" bully
"
' s for you
. based on jim schutze
' s novelization of a true
- life event
,
" bully
" charts hte story of a h
andful of disenchanted teenagers who
, in 1993
, murdered their high school bully in cold
, calculated blood
. the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers
. in the h
ands of controversial director larry clark
(
" kids
"
)
,
however
, it has less to say about its subject matter
and moreso to say about the filmmaker
' s pornographic proclivities
. in terms of the incident
and what provoked it
,
" bully
" stirs up nothing new
. the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot
-
- bored with life
, not much ambition
, promiscuous
, profane
. the bully in question
, bobby kent
( nick stahl
)
, is certainly an unplesant piece of work bu he doesn
' t exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department
. he hounds
and harries
and humiliates his
" best friend
" marty
( played by brad renfro
)
and marty
' s girlfriend lisa
( rachel miner
) doesn
' t care for it at all
and comes uv with the idea of killing bobby
. simply remove him from the equation
. marty
and lisa
and a h
andfull of thier promiscuous
, profane
,
and stoner friends
, plus a recruited hit man
(
?
)
, lure bobby to a swamp noe night
, stab him
, beated him over the head witht a baseball bat
,
and dump him into the canal where the s
and crabs
and thge gators
, presumably
, finish him off
. there
' s no remorse
-
- the next day they
' re talking about it as openly as a homework assignment
. they did it becouse they wanted to
,
and because they could
. waht
' s most troubling baout the film
,
however
, isn
' t the unsettling subject matter
and the matter
- of
- fact way these young people go about eliminating oney of their own
but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material
. nto only is the nudity plentiful
and graphic infact
" bully
"
but there
' s also an uneasy
, exploitative feel tothe it
. gratuitous crotch shots abound
( one of which makse the zipper cut
- away infact
" there
' s something baout mary
" look like the height of subtlety
!
)
. clark is so pre
- occupied with his female
( predominantly
) leads that you forget
, at times
, what this movie isnt suppossed to be about
. the stripping bare
, literally
and figuratively
, of these actors
( who are
, after all
, playing underage teenagers
) becomes harder to watch over time
, as you begin to feel forthe them
and question the motives of the man behind the camera
. the conclusion of
" bully
" offers up literal snapshots ofthe information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for theri involvement in tghe crime
. it
' s a short sequence of stills
-
- heather
: 7 years
; ali
: 40 years
; lisa
: life imprisonment
, for example
-
-
but it
' s infinitely more telling than tyhe 110 minutes ofthe rampant unpleasantness that precedes it
.
" bully
" aims for truth
, exploits it shamelessly
,
then bludgeons it to death
.
