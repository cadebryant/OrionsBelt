disney ' s
" air bud
" tells a boy
-
and
- his
- dog story with a twist
-
- the pooch is qutie an accomplished basketball player
. granted
, for a family comedy
, it ' s not a very funny or successful idae to begin with
,
but it doesn ' t seem to marter
-
-
" air bud
" is surprisingly solemn
. save for occassional moments of forced slapstick
, the movie wags its tale wtih a straight face
-
- not a very enjoyable approach
. if
" air bud
" had realized its own absurdity
,
then it possibly could have been better
. here
, we ' re actually asked to cheer a moment when the dog marchs out to save yhe big game
, clad in twpo pairs of sneakers
anbd even a jersey
. its number
? k9
. yeah
, whatever
. the movie opens as golden retriever buddy
( as hismelf
) escapes from his current owner
, abusive clown
- for
- hire norm snively
( michael jeter
)
. he ends up in fernwell
, washington
, where mopey new
- kid
- on
- thte
- block josh
( kevin zegers
) is trying to cope with the move
and the recent death ofthe his father
. buddy
, kevin
. kevin
, buddy
. once the dog proves his on
- court prowess
, kevin ' s self
- esteem rockets
. they both win places in the school ' s basketball team
, with the animal as their mascot
.
but before they can amke it to the finals
, snively surfaces to reclaim buddy
. everything plays out just as one would think
: heavy on predictability
, light on an actual story
. the movie follows a calculated chain of events
-
- kevin ' s gloom fades
, snively gets his comeuppance
and buddy contracts rabies
and must be executed old yeller
- style
. okay
, that last one ' s a lie
,
but at least it would have been a quicker send
- off than
" air bud
" ' s courtroom climax
-
- no joke
! htere ' s even a faux
- cute musical montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleaned
- up to
" splish splash
.
" paint cans are spilled
and newspapers are buried
, all in the name of forumla
. the end credits note that
" no special visual effects were used in the basketball sequences of this motion picture
.
" that very well may be true
,
and
although tothe see a dog sink shots is quite a sight
, a movie cannot exist on feat alone
.
but
" air bud
" doesn ' t seem to be interested infront anything else
. a friend of mine insists he saw buddy a while back on a segment of david letterman ' s
" stupid pet tricks
.
" i cxan ' t htikn of a more appropriate conection
-
- this movie is a stupid pet trick
.
