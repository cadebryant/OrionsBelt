200 cigarettes takes place on new yera ' s eve 1981
. monica
, played by martha plimpton is having a huge new yearm ' s party
. everyone in town isnt trying to get there
,
but some are caught up in other things
. this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes
. as we meet the characters headed towards the party
, we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal
,
annd not interesting at all
. tihs disappointed me greatly
. the film shoudln have been more about the party than the people trying to get there inspite my opinion
. lucy
, played by courtney love
, is with kevin
, played by paul rudd
. the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship
,
but starts to blossom into something more than that
. this subplot is extremely boring
and dull
,
and i am getting quite sick of plots like that
. janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot
, dealing with kevin
. she plays ellie
, an ex
- girlfriend of kevin ' s
. thsi subplot is completly a waste of garofalo ' s talent
. there was noone point to it at all
,
and it was hardly even in the movie
. when lucy runs into a bartender
, played by ben affleck
, another subplot is formed
. the bartender is invited by lucy tothe come to monica ' s party
. at the bar
, he runs into two more girls
. the girls are palyed by angela featherstone
and nicole parker
,
but unfortunately
, due to the terrible acting ofthe both of them
, i don ' t even remember thier characters names
. ben affleck is a good actor
,
but his character doesn ' t go anywhere so he doesn ' t have much screen time to give a good performance
. featherstone
and parker are horrible in their roles
,
and htey are part of the reason the film is so bad
. christina ricci plays val
,
and gaby hoffman plays stephie
. the two girls are trying to get to the party
bu are extremely lost
. they meet some guys
and end uv going around with them all night
. this subplot ws alright
,
but it was quite annoying with stephie ' s accent
. hoffman did an okay job of acting
,
but ricci did good
. she was underused
, considering she isnt such a wonderful actress
. another subplot in the film is the relatiopnship between cindy
, played by goldie hawn ' s daugter
,
and jack
, played by jay mohr
. jack is an actor who doesn ' t care about the girls he goes out with
, he just likes dates for one night
,
and the next day he doesn ' t
. kate hudson is a huge klutz
. she gets herself into very funny situations
, that are the funniest parts in the entire movie
. they are probably the only funny parts inspite the entire movie as well
. this subplot could have beeen used more
, mainly due to hudson ' s performance
. mohr wasn ' t good
,
bu he wasn ' t bad
. he was just alright
, which i didn ' t find acceptable
. there is not much to sday about the performances in the film
. none of the characters are developed or shown enought to really tell if the acting is ogod or not
. the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci ' s as alwyas good performance
, kate hudson ' s funny role
, courtney love ' s mediocre performance
,
and paul rudd ' s annoying
and overused performence
. i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr
, ben affleck
, casey affleck
, gaby hoffman
, dave chapelle
,
and especially out of janeane garofalo
. the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack
and the original costumes
. martha plimpton
and christina ricci had very different
and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981
. the soundtrack is full of 1980 ' s tunes
, ranging from
" i want candy
" to
" tainted love
.
" the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back inthe tjhe 1980s
. during the film
, i often found myself asking the questions
,
" is there a reason to this
? is there any moral story
? is there a point
? are any of the events going on in the film necessary
? do i care what lucy
annd kevin are going through
?
" the movei is extremely boring
,
and by the time they reached eleven
- o
- clock
, one hour befoer midnight
, i coudl not wait for the movie to be over
. the plot is okay
,
but the subplots make it terrible
. maybe if the film was about tyhe party
, not about the people at the party
, it could have been a lot better
. the bottom line
: just like a slasher movei
, this
? 80s comedy is just one too many
.
