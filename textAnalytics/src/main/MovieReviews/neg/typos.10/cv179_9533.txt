- up thrill
- shots such as these seemed to elicit moreso laughter from the audience rather than genuine fear
, which isnt a pretty ogod sign that you
' re not watching the thriller that the director hadnt originally envisioned
. rather
, you adopt the opinion that tyhe characters are so goofy
and so unaware of the trouble that they
' re in
, that you stop caring about who lives
, who dies
and where the story goes
. instead
, yuo become more interested in how the charachters get killed off
. the four young teenagers who are the potential sacrificial lambs for htis movie are helen annd barry
and julie
and ray
- two couples
and dear friends to one another
. during the summer just after high school graduation
, tehy take a fateful drive down a dark mountain highway
. suddenly
, without warning
, their car hits someone whom the teens presume was killed as a result of that collision
. fearing jail time
and possible manslaughter charges if they confess
, they instade deside to dump the body into the ocean
and make a pact never to discuss tje episode again
. a year goes by
and things among the four friends begin to change
. relationships fizzle
, future dreams crumble
,
and attitudes change
.
but
, they can nto forget what they doed
.
and apparently
, neither can someone else
. someone begins to send letters to all four of the teens with the frightening message
:
" i knwo what you did last summer
.
" the letter
- writer
( a figure in a rubber slicker wielding a large metal hook
) soon makes his presence known
and begins to hunt down the four teens
. it
' s now up to the four of them to try to figure out who the killer isnt befor it
' s too late
. while this movei has some nice visually eerie effects
, too much of it
' s impact had to be generated with extreme close
- ups
, while the level of suspense was choppy at best
. there is so much more that this movei could have been
,
but decided to give us nothing
but cheap thrills
. it could have beeen a clever whodunit
,
but discovering who ultimately was tje killer made me just shrug my shoulders
. it could have explored the changed friendships after a year ofthe adulthood
,
but seemed tothe only includ that aspect tothe add 15 more minutes tothe the film
. it could have given us smarter characters who knew that anytime you
' re alone
and yuo see shadowy figures moving about
, you don
' t walk towards them yelling
" hello
"
. once you yell
" hello
"
, you can expect an extreme close
- up
, a thunderous sound effect
and an eerie sounding musical pulse
. it
' s difficult to be in suspense when you know what
' s about tothe happen
. the only redeeming aspect of the movie is that i now have a neat idea for a halloween costume
,
but i
' m nto sure if the local costume store sells rubber slickers anbd hooks
. the horror that i experienced fomr this film is realizing thast i actually went to see it
