there have been merchant
- ivory costume dramas witht more of a pulse than
" the mod squad
,
" a self
- consciously
" hip
" cinematic rendering of the old tv serieses still looked upon fondly by so many baby
- boomers
. well
, said
" squad
" certainly won
' t be a pleasant viewing experiece for them or anybody else
, mabey even the teen target audience hte movie has been geared towards
. a contemporary take on this decidedly
' 70s show doesn
' t exactlly seem unwarrented
,
but one wonders if the mold it accumulated hwile waiting on teh shelf didn
' t transform into a full
- blown case of botulism
. how curious that the film begins by defining both mod
and squad
, insisting that the latter is a group of people working toghether
and
then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time
. they are julie
, pete
and linc
, reformed delinquents wroking undercover fo the lapd
( exposition put out of the way so fast that you
' re likely to be lost from the opening moments on
)
,
and tehy are respectively played by claire danes
, giovanni ribisi
and omar epps
, talented actors each deserving of better than this
. their plight involves st
andard cop
- corruption stuff
, as our would
- be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover
- up after thier superior
( reliable dennis farina
, one of the best things here
and gone so quickly
) gets killed
and framed for drug trafficking
. htey pout a lot
and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys
and linda tripp
but few others
. when you
' re supposed to be asking
,
" what
' s going to happen next
?
"
, you
' ll instead entertain
thoughts like
" who are these people
and why should i care
?
" or
" aren
' t thrillers supposed to contain thrills
?
" not that danes
, epps
and ribisi don
' t give it a shot
. danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep
, as evidenced by
" my so
- called life
,
"
but she
' s saddled with a mysterious
- boyfriend
( josh brolin
) subplot so see
- thru you beign to seriously question her so
- called intelligence
. ditto for ribisi
' s
(
" saving private ryan
"
) looney loose cannon
,
though at least he performs wtih a wild
-
and
- crazy vigor tath occasionally dem
ands attention
.
but epps
- poor epps
. epps
(
" higher learning
"
) is so short
- changed he
' s reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him
. all this sloppiness can be attri
buted to the screenwriters
, one of whom
, scott silver
, isnt also tje director
. they must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings
( the look of the film is really quite impressive
)
, it
' ll somehow pay off
, bu this
" mod squad
" plods anyway
. characters are non
- existent
; present are jstu some good
- looking young things modeling cool levis
and cooler attitudes
. plot hardly escapes confusing convention
.
and the oney genre element you
' d think would be sohw up in generous portions
- a faw nifty explosions
, soem fights
, any kind of action whatsoever
- only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest
. all those quick to put down lastr month
' s inept
but serviceable
" my favorite martian
" update need to take a step back
. here
' s a small
- to
- big
- screen translation that really should
' ve stayed in its former incarnation
,
" mod
" or not
.
