there have beeen merchant
- ivory costume dramas withthe more of a pulse than
" the mod squad
,
" a self
- consciously
" hip
" cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby
- boomers
. well
, said
" squad
" certainly won ' t be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else
, maeby even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards
. a contemporary take on this decidedly ' 70s show doesn ' t exactly seem unwarranted
,
bu one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didn ' t transform into a full
- blown case of botulism
. how curious that the film beggins by defining both mod
and squad
, insisting that the latter is a group of people working together
and
then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time
. they are julie
, pete
and linc
, reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd
( exposition put out of the way so fast that you ' re likely to be lost fomr the oppening moments on
)
,
and they are respectivly played by claire danes
, giovanni ribisi
and omar epps
, talented actors each deserving of better than this
. their plight involves standart cop
- corruption stuff
, as our would
- be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover
- up after their superior
( reliable dennis farina
, one of the best thigsn here
and gone so quickly
) gets killed
and framed fo drug trafficking
. they pout a lot
and eventualy get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using sirvaylence tactics that would impress the hardy boys
and linda tripp
but few others
. wehn you ' re supposed to be asking
,
" what ' s going to happn next
?
"
, you ' ll instead entertain thoughts liek
" who are these people
anbd why should i care
?
" or
" aren ' t thrillers supposed to contain thrills
?
" not tyhat danes
, epps
and ribisi don ' t give it a shooted
. danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep
, as evidenced by
" my so
- called life
,
"
but she ' s saddled with a mysterious
- boyfriend
( josh brolin
) subplot so see
- thru you begin to seriously question her so
- called intelligence
. ditto for ribisi ' s
(
" saving private ryan
"
) looney loose cannon
,
though at least he performs with a wild
-
and
- crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention
.
but epps
- poor epps
. epps
(
" higher learning
"
) is so short
- changed he ' s reduced tothe literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him
. all this sloppiness cin be attributed to the screenwriters
, one ofthe whom
, scott silver
, is allso the director
. they must think that if they dress up theri stupid story in such spiffy trappings
( the look ofthe the film isnt really quite impressive
)
, it ' ll somehow pay off
,
but this
" mod squad
" plods anyway
. characters are non
- existent
; present are just some good
- looking young things modeling cool levis
and cooler attitudes
. plot hardly escapes confusing convention
.
and the one genre element you ' d think would be show up in generous portions
- a few nifty explosions
, some fights
, any kind ofthe action whatsoever
- onyl rarely makes it to this dull gabfest
. all those quick to put down last month ' s inept
but serviceable
" my favorite martian
" update ened to take a step back
. here ' s a small
- to
- big
- screen translation that really should ' ve stayed in its fromer incarnation
,
" mod
" or not
.
