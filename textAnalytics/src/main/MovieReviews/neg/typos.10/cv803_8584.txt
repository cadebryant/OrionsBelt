note
: some may concider portions of the following text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. it
' s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor
' s frist feature film
, dream with the fishes
, when the plodding
, tedeous opening sequence finaly pays off with a potentially provocative setup
. any hopeful expectations
,
however
, are soon vanquished as the film settles apon being an uninvolving mismatched
- buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be inspite the film
' s latter half
. the film
' s central characters are terry
( david arquette
)
, a depressed
, lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident
,
and nick
( brad hunt
)
, a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill
. nick lives in the apartment building across from terry
, who spies on tyhe trysts between nick
and girlfriend liz
( kathryn erbe
) with his trusty set of binoculars
,
but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half
- drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge
, unconvincingly vowing suicide
. nick casually asks for terry
' s wristwatch
,
and eventually cons terry into a trade
- the watch for a bottle of pills
. of course
, terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects
,
and he angrily sets outloud to find nick in order to retrieve his watch
. learning of nick
' s condition
( he only has a h
andful of weeks left
)
, terry
' s compassion kicks iin
,
and the two eventually come tothe a distinctly peculiar arrangement
- terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick
' s lifelong fantasies
,
and nick will fulfill terry
' s death wish by killing him
. this is a promising premise
,
and mr
. taylor
' s film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from htis point
,
but he instade chooses tothe capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters
( terry is a repessed
, mournful character who wants to die
, while nick is a free spirit wih a joie de vivre who is dieing
but wants to live
)
and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits
,
and where the straight
- laced character learns to enjoy
and ppreciate life when hooked up withthe a quirky character
. htis is by
- the
- numbers plotting
, buddy movie
/ road movie redux
.
however
, dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline
,
but by the characters which carry the story
- it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic
, if not likeable
. unfortunately
, that is not the case here
, where both of tghe film
' s leading characters are thorougly uninteresting
and annoying
, giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights
,
and even less reason to want to follow thier onscreen exploits
. far from a romp
, this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt
,
and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond
. mr
. taylor
' s dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with tyhe fishes
- while attempting to capture a quirky
and clever tone
, it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived
( witness such lines as
" you should have asked something more interesting
, like
' do you enjoy thte pain
?
'
- see
, that
' s provacative
, leaves room fo further questions
.
"
) the film enjoys a few inspired moments
- the urn scene
, a session of nude bowling
, the policeman joining in on terry
and nick
' s acid trip
-
but unfortunatetely these instances are few
and far between
,
and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers mroe as attempts rather than actual successes
. this occurs particuarly often during the film
' s opening sequence
- as terry isnt wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital
, i
' m realising that this is
* intended
* to be funny
,
al
though nary a smile crept upon my lips
- which is probably due to the obvious fact that it
' s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts
, sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick
' s scheme of tricking him
; this is not a film wich hasnt the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes
. tjhe entire sequence is
,
then
, clearly an exercise for character exposition
, with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability
. among the cast
, coming off best is david arquette
, the current master inspite the portrayal of meek
, squirming
, stammering fresh
- faced characters
- he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang
' s swimming with sharks
- who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry
. mr
. taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique
, where the portions ofthe the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy
and heavily saturated
, as opposed to a bright
, crisp look for the smalltown scenes
. the charge of dream witht the fishes
' s protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bited of an odd noe coming from me
; i seem to hvae a predilection for films whith unlikeable cahracters
,
and indeed
, in many cases have i been in the minority
, supporting films which have beeen condemned as interminable due to the difficult
, audience
- unfriendly nature of their characters
. forthe dream with the fishes
,
though
, i did find mysef on the flip side of coin
, oftenly hoping that the film would quickly conclude
,
and that the nick character would just hurry up
and die
.
