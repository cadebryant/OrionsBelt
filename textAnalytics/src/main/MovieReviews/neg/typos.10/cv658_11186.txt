senseless is a prime example of what can happen whn you try to push a one
- joke concept a bited too far
. director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this
, having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies
. marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon
, a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage
.
however
, he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition
, scott thorpe
( david spade
, in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep
)
: an athletic record
, sponsorship by a fraternity
,
and
, most of all
, a wealthy family to back him up
. inspite fact
, darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet
.
but there may be a ight at the end of thast tunnel
. he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university
' s dr
. wheedon
( brad dourif
)
. as a result
, his senses are magnified tenfold
. using his newfound abilities
, he sets himselv in complete pursuit of the job
( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side
- effects to having super senses
)
. naturally
, marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle
, giving jim carrey
- ish amounts ofthe physical humor
. the problem is
, aside from a few genuinely inspired bits
, there
' s not much that
' s funny here
. the film has it
' s one central gag
,
and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor
. there obviously wasn
' t much
thought put into the plot
. the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous
. i mean
, why the emphasis on extra
- curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single
- elimination quiz anyhow
?
and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester
? to give it credit
, senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl
' s roommate
, tim laflour
( matthew lillard
)
. apparently
, he is supposed to be faddish
,
but thge film never does anytying with him
, leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie
. his
" intervention
" scenes with darryl
,
however
, dont provide a rare
,
and welcome
, laugh
.
and
then there
' s the love interest which isnt always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one
. in this case
, the object of darryl
' s amor is janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a fellow student who won
' t have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super
- senses
. needless to say
, the romance isnt completely extraneous
,
and adds little to the film
. this is a film that desperately needed something else
. be that a good plot
, more jokes
( or simply funnier ones
)
, or a strong character or twpo
, anything would have helped senseless get off tjhe ground
. as it is
, all the manic exuberant mugging in yhe world can
' t help marlon wayans get this one off the ground
.
