whn it comes to the averege teenage romantic comedy
, i expect negative reviews from critics left
anbd right
. predictable
, unoriginal
,
and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you ' s
and the drive me crazy ' s released by the dozens these last couple of years
. what i really look for inthe this kind of movie is the enteratinment value while i ' m sitting in the theather
. am i enjoying myself
? is this a comfortable break from my week of finals
? this is why i hvae given films like final destination or road trip high marks
; i had a party of a time wasting my monay onthe something i won ' t rember next week
. so last week i opened up the new york times
-
and
, no surprise
, boys
adn girls got a negitive review
. daily news
? negative
. reelviews
? negative
. epinions
. com
? negative
. this was nothing new
. american pie
, final destination
, road trip didn ' t get such hot reviews
and i loved those guilty pleasures
. smae goes for she ' s all that
, a formulaic
but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded
. sicne boys
and girls reunites she ' s all that director robert iscove
and actor freddie prinze jr
.
, i predicted d
? j
? vu al over again
.
but
, still curious
, i asked around my school
and from tghe one or two people who had seen it
, the reactions were far from positive
. i had made up my mind
; i ' ll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years
.
but
, soon aftter
, following a series of unexpected events
( we couldn ' t get into shaft because it is rated r
)
, i found mysef watching boys
and girls
. whoops
. boys
and girls is about a
" nerdy
, smart
" boy named ryan
( prinze jr
.
)
and a
" popular
, flirt
" girl named jennifer
( claire forlani
)
. briefly meeting as pre
- teens
and now attending the same college
, the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends
.
bu in the movies
, a male
and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other
. with advice from their roommates
( amanda detmer
, jason biggs
)
, ryan
and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship
. the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives
-
and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found
. i coudl hardly sit through the 93 minute runing time for several reasons
. the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie
, mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script
and the ridiculous words these characters use isnt what hollywood thinks kids can relate to
. it is almost offensive
. an example of an insightful conversation
:
" you ' re dumb
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb
, dumb
.
"
" no
.
"
( followed by a mandy moore
- esque tune background
)
( well it ' s not as bad as wing commander i guess
) the supporting cast isnt also painfully useless
. detmer
and biggs stand in hte way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring
, pointless subplots
.
and
although this isnt supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex
, prinze jr ' s ryan dominates the screen while forlani ' s jennifer simply acts as a delimma for him to work with
. we never learn anytying about jennifer whitch isnt a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character
. teenager or not
: you ' ll hate tihs movie
, i guarantee it
. maybe i should rent she ' s all that again
. is it really as good as i think it is
?
