when it comes to the averege teenage romantic comedy
, i expect negative reviews from critics left
and right
. predictable
, unoriginal
,
and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you
' s
and the drive me crazy
' s released by the dozens these last couple of years
. what i really look for infact this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i
' m sitting in the theather
. am i enjoying myself
? is this a confortable break from my week of finals
? this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks
; i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won
' t remember next week
. so last week i opened up the new york times
-
and
, no surprise
, boys
and girls got a negative review
. daily news
? negative
. reelviews
? negative
. epinions
. com
? negative
. this was nothing new
. american pie
, final destination
, road trip didn
' t get such hot reviews
and i loved those guilty pleasures
. same goes for she
' s all that
, a formulaic
but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded
. since boys
and girls reunites she
' s all that director robert iscove
and actor freddie prinze jr
.
, i predicted d
? j
? vu al over again
. bu
, still curious
, i asked around my school annd from the one or two peple who had seen it
, the reactions were far ffrom positive
. i had made up my mind
; i
' ll catch it on video or cable in a cuple ofthe years
.
but
, soon after
, following a series of unexpected events
( we couldn
' t get into shaft because it is rated r
)
, i found mysef watching boys
and girls
. whoops
. boys
and girls is about a
" nerdy
, smart
" boy named ryan
( prinze jr
.
)
and a
" popular
, flirt
" girl named jennifer
( claire forlani
)
. briefly meeting as pre
- teens
and now attending the same college
, the two bump inot eahc other so many times that eventually they become best friends
.
but in the movies
, a male
and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other
. with advice from their roommates
( am
anda detmer
, jason biggs
)
, ryan
and jennifer atempt tothe discover tjhe true meaning of their relationship
. the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives
-
and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found
. i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons
. tghe dialogue is probably the worst i haev ever seen in any movie
, mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script
and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to
. it is almost offensive
. an example of an insightful conversation
:
" you
' re dumb
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb
, dumb
.
"
" no
.
"
( followed by a m
andy moore
- esque tune background
)
( well it
' s not as bad as wing comm
ander i guess
) the supporting cast isnt also painfully useless
. detmer
and biggs st
and inthe the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring
, pointless subplots
.
and
al
though this isnt supposed tothe be from both perspectives of the human sex
, prinze jr
' s ryan dominates the screen while forlani
' s jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him tothe wokr with
. we never learn anything baout jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the onyl actor to bring any life into her character
. teenager or nto
: you
' ll hate tihs movei
, i guarantee it
. maybe i should rent she
' s all that again
. is it really as good as i think it is
?
