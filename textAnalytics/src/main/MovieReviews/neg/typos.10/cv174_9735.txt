starship troopers is a bad movie
. i mean
, a realyl
, really
, bad movei
. not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood
, gore
and body parts shown on the screen
, it blissfully jumps over that line
, apparently unaware that tyhe movie trailers appeal to an audience ofthe five tothe fifteen year olds
( of which i saw many in the theatre
)
. looking past the appalling sight of overdone violentce
, we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best
, no strong lead characters
, a blatant disregard for physics
,
and a very obvious naziesque theme
. that being said
, onto the review
: the movie starts with a propag
anda message ffrom tjhe federation
( who
' s logo bears a
* strong
* resemblance to a nazi german eagle
)
, urging the populace to go off
and fight the bugs
, who are attempting to destroy earth
. the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance
, pledging allegiance to the federation
( again
, sound familiar
?
)
. as the movie progresses
, we are shown terror tactic training
, as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm
,
and throws a knife through another
' s h
and
. eventually
, the recruits embark on a journey tothe a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy
, to fight the bugs on thier hmeo planet
. as our faster tahn light travelling
" heroes
" arrive on planet
, they drop onto the planet
,
and burst our of their craft br
andishing
.
.
.
" what
?
" yuo say
,
" lazer beam weapons
? sonic weapons
? phasers
? photon cannons
?
"
. nope
, they hop out br
andishing good old 1997 machine guns
, pump action rifles
,
and tactical nucular weapons
! i guess a lot of physics money r
& d went into travel
and not weaponry
. as the assault begins
, our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon
. two members of the group notice rocks slipping
and falling above them
,
and one even sees a streak fly by
,
but disregards it as nothing
. thsi of course
, leads to mroe massive carnage
, blood shed
,
and graphic depictions of limbs
and heads bieng ripped
and severed from their bodies
. again
, i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at baout the same pace as their weapons
! in the end
, we see neil patrick
" doogie howser
" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat
, hat
,
and gloves
. he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug
,
and thne proclaims that the bugs are scared
! this sets tyhe troopers into a frenzy
, as they are now one step closer to completing thier gool
, total genocide of a species
( again
, sound familiar
?
?
)
. i have tried very hard not to step on
and spoil the plot with this review
,
but given it
' s non
- existence
, i may have anyway
. i could go on for pages ripping this movei apart
,
but don
' t want to bore you too badly
. in short
, i felt as if i were subjected to a mix vetween a pro
- nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies
, a drivers education accident scene film
,
and a complete blank screen
( the plot
, of course
)
. i wouldn
' t recommend this movie to anyone
, anywhere
, under any circumstance
