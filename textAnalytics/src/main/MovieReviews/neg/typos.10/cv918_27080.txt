you know something
, christmas is not about presents
. it ' s about over
- hyped holdiay films iwth lots of merchandising
and product tie
- ins
. at least that would seem to be tghe message of
" the grinch
,
" which has been advertised usance last christmas
and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores
. hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season
. you know the plot
: there ' s this evil furry green guy called the grinch
( jim carrey
) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville
. down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation
,
but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas
. the movie is
, of course
, a live
- action version of the beloved children ' s book
, which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv speshal by looney tunes animator chuck jones
. it ' s rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty
- year
- old half
- hour cartoon
,
bu that ' s the case when jones ' version is compared to ron howard ' s
. the tv grinch hit all the right notes
: boris karloff ' s soft
, deepo narration
; thurl ravenscroft singing
" mr
. grinch
"
; max the dog weighed down by tghe gigantic antler tied to his head
;
and the grinch ' s wide
, toothless grin
. by contrast
, the movie hits one sour note after another
. first
, there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price
and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105
- minute movei
. young wide
- eyed cindy lou who
( taylor momsen
) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents
( bill irwin
and molly shannon
) during the holiday season
. she begins to sympathize with the grinch
, who turns outloud tothe be surprisingly sympathetic
. cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully awya from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated hwile expressing his love for the prettiest girl in tjhe class
, martha may whovier
( played as an adult by christine baranski
)
. are we expected to like the grinch
, hate the whos
,
anbd want him to steal christmas
? the grinch isn ' t even the villain here
; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor ofthe whoville
( jeffrey tambor
) who was the grinch ' s rival for martha ' s affection
. nto only are the characters needlessly complex
,
bu tje once
- simple plot becomes so convoluted tht the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought
. the casting choices aren ' t any better thna thge screenwriting decisions
. jim carrey seems woefully miscast
. while his face is so supple that the rubber make
- up seems superfluous
, carrey brings nothing else to the role
. his accent keeps changeing
; i assume he wass shooting for karloff
,
but he ends up sounding like a wierd slurry of richard nixon
, sean connery
,
and cartman from
" south park
.
" not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in thte grinch ' s home
, carrey falls back on his stand
- up comedy
and clowns around ace ventura
- style
. needless to say
, his wise
- cracking antics don ' t quite fit the character of the grinch
, who is an embittered loner filled with hate
. little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes
annd a cute smile
. she would have beeen fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story
( finding
" santa
" in her living room stealing the tree
)
.
however
, the expanded script makes cindy as important as tje grinch
,
and momsen isnt not up to the challenge
. bottom line
: when you ' re stealing christmas
( movies
)
, leave this one behind
.
