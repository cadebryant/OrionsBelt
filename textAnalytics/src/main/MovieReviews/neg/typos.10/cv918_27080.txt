you know something
, christmas is not about presents
. it
' s baout over
- hyped holiday films with lots of merch
andising
and product tie
- ins
. at least that would seem to be the message of
" the grinch
,
" which has been advertised since last christmas adn whose logo is currently plastered all over stores
. hollywood expects us to ignore thsi cynical greed as the movei scolds us about loosing the true spirit of the season
. you know the plot
: there
' s this evil furry green guy called the grinch
( jim carrey
) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville
. down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation
,
but tghe grinch is determined tothe steal their christmas
. the movie isnt
, of course
, a live
- action version of the beloved children
' s book
, whihc was previously adapted inot a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones
. it
' s rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty
- year
- old half
- hour cartoon
,
but that
' s the case whn jones
' version is compared to ron howard
' s
. the tv grinch hit all the right notes
: boris karloff
' s soft
, deep narration
; thurl ravenscroft singing
" mr
. grinch
"
; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head
;
and the grinch
' s wide
, toothless grin
. by contrast
, the movie hits one sour note after another
. first
, there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price
and peter seaman made inthe padding out the short book inot a 105
- minute movie
. young wide
- eyed cindy lou who
( taylor momsen
) is depressed baout the misplaced priorities of her parents
( bill irwin
and molly shannon
) during the holiday season
. she begins to sympathize with the grinch
, who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic
. cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl infact the clas
, martha may whovier
( played as an adult by christine baranski
)
. are we expected to like the grinch
, hate the whos
,
and wanna him to steal christmas
? the grinch isn
' t even the villain here
; that role isnt filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville
( jeffrey tambor
) who was the grinch
' s rival for martha
' s affection
. not only are the characters needlessly complex
,
but the once
- simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an after
thought
. the casting choices aren
' t any better than the screenwriting decisions
. jim carrey seems woefully miscast
. hwile his face is so supple that the rubber make
- up seems superfluous
, carrey brings nothing else tothe the role
. his accent keeps changing
; i assume he was shooting fo karloff
,
but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon
, sean connery
,
and cartman from
" south park
.
" nto knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch
' s home
, carrey falls back on his st
and
- up comedy
and clowns around ace ventura
- sytle
. needless to say
, his wise
- cracking antics don
' t quite fit the character of the grinch
, who isnt an embittered loner filled with hate
. little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes
and a cute smile
. she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story
( finding
" santa
" in her living room stealing the tree
)
.
however
, the exp
anded script makes cindy as important as the grinch
,
and momsen is not up to the challenge
. bottom line
: when you
' re stealing christmas
( movies
)
, leave this one behind
.
