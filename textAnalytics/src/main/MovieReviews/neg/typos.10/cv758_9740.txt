it was with a huge lack of something to do that i decided to watch this on good old upn on sunday afternoon
, when the only good things on tv are the second
- rate movies they show
( some are good
: they showed
" total reacll
" before this one
)
. if you know me
, i think seagal is probably the most boring action star to ever live
.
and this includes keanu reeves
. what do i hate about seagal
? i hate how he uses one facial expression for every single threatening
and non
- threatening situation
( the squint
)
. i hate those scenes in eveyr movei where he goes around
, bullying people up
, saying stupid lines with a brooklyn accent mroe fake than burt reynold
' s hairpiece in
" boogie nights
.
" i despise how he never gets a bruise inwhich any of his fights
. i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he
and the chief villain
. i hate his non
- satirical messages
( iin the beginning of this one
, he slaps onthe a quote from arthur miller
, which has nothing to do with the film
, except it
' s about brooklyn where this film takes place
)
.
and i hate how he
' s so narcissistic that he thinks tath he can actally fucking sing
( during the end credits
, he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung
and penned by him
)
. sure
, the guy
' s probably a nice guy in person
( i actually found him very non
- threatening wehn he was on letterman not too long ago
)
.
but tjhe guy makes worse films than reagan did
. so what
' s the plot of htis shit
- terpiece
? well
.
.
. something about him trying to catch a stupid
- ass crook
( william forsythe
) who shot
and killed his partner in broad daylight
. i couldn
' t believe how bad this scene was
- the guy ws conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect
( ahem
!
)
.
and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off
. i
' m sorry
, did anyone ever hear of concealing one
' s self
? so in comes ex
- brooklynite seagal
, who dedicates his life to catching this guy
.
and i just wished he had caught him in tjhe beginning
,
then ended the film
.
but noooo
, this drags on
, as he bullies forsythe
' s family members
( including a stupid bar
- owner
,
and none other than gina gershon as his other bar
- owner sister
)
.
and forsythe more than once threatens his family
. at one point
, he actually comes tothe their house anbd stalks them like a non
- threatening nicholson inaddition
" the shining
"
( complete whith them all hiding in the bathroom
,
but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool
and screaming to give them away
)
. seagal paints himself as a lovable person
, with a son
,
and a fiancee
. he even shows him hanging with his son
, checking up on his homework
,
and
then about to take him out for a bit of
" catch
,
" when he
' s conveniently called awya on assignment
. i dunno about you
,
but playing
" catch
" with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares
. he also shows him as that bad
- ass he wants to be
, with scenes ofthe him bullying crooks around
,
and taking out people who are stupid enought to attack him even after he
' s unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue
. serves them right
. this film
, as some of his do
, has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented
, bu don
' t appear to be in this film
. i already mentioned gina gershon
( who
' s pretty horrible in this one
)
, as well as william forsythe
, who over
- acts terribly
. i know this guy can act
: he was awesome in
" raising arizona
" as goodman
' s partner in crime
.
but he
' s just awful here
. jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down
. why is he the only one who gives a good peformance
? well
, becuase his role is small enough
and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility
. he seems tothe be in here just to give it a cool
" law
and order
" feeling
( even if it
' s not a
" cool
" feeling
)
.
and in cameos are b
- rated erotic
- thriller
- cinemax
- style stars
, shannon whirry
( as
" terry malloy
,
" which is more of a bad joke than a clever one
)
and a
thena massey
. oh
!
and
" er
"
' s julliana margiulles has two scenes
.
" out for justice
" just proves once again that american action films jstu suck
. i know that there
' s such a ogod thing as ogod action
- he
' s called john woo
.
but if you
' re in the mood fo some good old no
- brainer
, fun
- yot
- dumb action
, don
' t bother watching this
. it
' s so stupid that it
' s boring
.
