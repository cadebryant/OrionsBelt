this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground
, despite some good performances from a basically competent cast
. eddie
( sean penn
)
and maureen
( robin wright penn
) are a not
- so
- happily married couple down on their luck
. living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city
, tehy spend whta little income tehy have at the local bar
, owned by shorty
( stanton
)
, eddie ' s best friend
,
and his wief georgie
( mazar
)
. maureen
and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie ' s frequent disappearances
. on his return
, he promises her the world
and professes his undying love
. their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows
, as eddie disappears again
. like a junky craving the next high
, maureen suffers through the lows tothe reach the next high
. their relationship is further complicated by maureen ' s pregnancy
. she wants the baby
and the father
,
bu deep down seems to sense the inevitability ofthe losing hte latter
. during one of eddie ' s absences
, maureen is attacked by kiefer
, her neighbor
, who gets her drunk
( with her cooperation
)
and
then insists on intimacy
. she leaves badly bruised
and in fear of what eddie might do
-
- not to her
,
but tothe kiefer
. she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm wiull come tothe eddie as the result of his inevitable rage
. he lashes outloud as she expects
,
and ends up in an institution for what he believes tothe be 3 months
-
-
but in reality is 10 years
. during this decade
, maureen divorces eddie
and remarries a mroe solid
and reliable individual
, joey
( travolta
, in a small role
)
. her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution
adn comes to find her
. joey insists onthe bringing eddie into his home
and making his wief choose between her husban
(
and father of two children
)
and stability
( joey makes a good living
, drives a cadillac
,
and they live in a large house in hte suburbs
)
and the love of her previous life
. she chooses her past
,
and sacrifices not only her new life
but her old
( by giving up her
and eddie ' s daughter to joey
)
.
but hte eddie that she knew is gone
, replaced by a mere shell of the man he was
. maureen is herself a mere shell
, more an automaton than a woman
-
- as if she had gone through whatever therapy
and treatment eddie was given along with him
. perhaps theese two really do need each other
and can find happiness
( or maybe the lack ofthe sadness
) together
,
but the movie ' s denouement was not convincing
.
