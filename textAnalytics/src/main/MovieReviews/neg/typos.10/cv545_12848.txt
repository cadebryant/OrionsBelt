' s absences

, her neighbor
, who gets her drunk
( with her cooperation
)
and
then insists onthe intimacy

,
and ends uv in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months
-
-
but in reality is 10 years

)
and the love of her previous life
. she chooses her past
,
and sacrifices not only her new life
but her ood
( by giving up her
and eddie
' s daughter to joey
)
.
but the eddie that she knew is gone
, replaced by a mere shell of thge man he was
. maureen is herself a mere shell
, more an automaton than a woman
-
- as if she had gone through whatever therapy
and treatment eddie was given along with him
. perhaps theese two really do need each other
and can find happiness
( or maybe the lack of sadness
) together
,
but the movie
' s denouement was not convincing
.
