nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink
-
and
- a
- concussive
- nudge bombast
- o
- rama con air
. the oppening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe
, a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter
and serving eight years infact prision after an ill
- fated bar
- room brawl
. the prison scenes are accompanied by voice
- overs in which poe
, in a languid southern drawl
, describes prison life to his wife back home
and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met
. if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity
, it probably shoudl
. cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim
- witted
and ridiculous
,
and tath he
' s going to have to do something to keep himself entertained
. annd thus he slips into a familiar
, surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings
-
- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed
- up version of raising arizona

. cage should have known what he was getting himself into
. he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock
,
and if there
' s noe thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production
( even without his late partner don simpson
)
, it
' s that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the
_ last
_ bruckheimer production
. the critical difference betweeen the rock
and con air is cage
' s performance
. in the rock
, cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time
. thta sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self
- awareness
. while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prision transport plane whose goal is just to get home
, cage
' s goal is different
but jsut as simple
: to get out of the film with smoe mesure of dignity intact
. audiences
, too
, should know what they
' re getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production
. in fatc
, the marketing people are counting on it
. no one who loathed the rock for its swear
- grunt
- blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air
; noone one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons wiull be dissuaded
. director simon west
(
yet anyother tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab
' s soda fountain
) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline
/ testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture
( it
' s perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma
; like insulin
, con air does the work of a gl
and
)
. what he doesn
' t deliver is a moment of suspense
. a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock
' s notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene thna just blowing up the desk
; a really
,
_ really
_ big desk
and a really
,
_ really
_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely
. if eather west or bruckheimer were interested inwhich genuine tension
, they might have done something with con air
' s creepiest set
- uv
. at a desert stop for the plane
- load of convicts
, serial killer garl
and greene
( steve buscemi
) w
anders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool
. their tete
- a
- tete is eerie
and menacing
, providing a welcome shift in tone
and giving buscemi a chance to st
and out inaddition a cast with too many villains
( danny trejo
, ving rhames
and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them
)
. in fact
, con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest mesure of restraint would have beeen an improvement
-
- too many characters
, too much editing
, too many dopey punch lines
, too much of the cheap
, ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts
. it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance
. while malkovich goes for the outrageous
and john cusack
( as a u
. s
. marshal
) goes for earnest
, cage looks liuke he just wants tothe go tothe sleep
. his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape
, his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his persuit of thta big box of huggies
. it doesn
' t bode well for cage
' s appearance in face
/ off later this month
; prehaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over
and over
. there
' s a word for people liek yuo
, nicolas
. that word is called recidivist
.
.
. repeat offender
