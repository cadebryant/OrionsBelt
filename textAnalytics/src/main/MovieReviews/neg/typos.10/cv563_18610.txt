the thirteenth floor is a bland
, obligatory exercise in genre film
- making
. if i hadn ' t recently watched tyhe matrix
and open your eyes
-
- both ofthe which are similar
but far superior
-
- i might ahev been a little nicer to this picture
. craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall
, the rich co
- creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder ofthe his boss
( armin mueller
- stahl
)
. everything that was subtle
and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one
,
and characters stare at each other for maddeningly
- long periods of time
and refuse to communicate on any realistic level
. the acting is okay
,
bu the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of
,
and features a script
( co
- penned by director josef rusnak
) loaded with cliches
and stock characters
. there are individual scenes
and ideas that work
-
- i like the thought of a sentient computer program
-
-
but none of the film ' s strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree
. producer roland emmerich
, based onthe this
and his previous directorial effords
, seems hell
- bent on bringing us the ultimate standard iin mediocre science
- fiction
.
