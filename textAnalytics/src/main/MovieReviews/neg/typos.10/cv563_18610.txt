the thirteenth floor is a bl
and
, obligatory exercise in genre film
- making
. if i hadn
' t recently watched the matrix annd open your eyes
-
- both of which are similar
but far superior
-
- i might have been a little nicer to thsi picture
. craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall
, the rich co
- creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss
( armin mueller
- stahl
)
. everything taht was subtle
and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one
, anbd characters stare at each other for maddeningly
- long periods of time
and refuse to communicate on any realistic level
. the acting is okay
,
but the film suffers from every logical flaw oney could think of
,
and features a script
( co
- penned by director josef rusnak
) loaded with cliches
and stock characters
. there are individule scenes
and ideas that work
-
- i like the
thought of a sentient computer programe
-
-
but none ofthe the film
' s strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree
. producer rol
and emmerich
, based on this
and his previous directorial efforts
, seems hell
- bent on bringing us the ultimate st
andard in mediocre science
- fiction
.
