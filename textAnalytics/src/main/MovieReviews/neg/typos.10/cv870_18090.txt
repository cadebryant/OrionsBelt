these days
, people have rether short attension span
and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run
. 1970s nostalgia is already wearing off
,
and now
, people are becoming mroe
and more interested in 1980s
. fewd years in the future
, early 1990s are going tothe be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia
.
however
, i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about tje hollywood products of that perido
. one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon
' s loaded weapon 1
, that
, in many ways
, symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry
- lack of originality
and ideas
. being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series
, this film pairs two l
. a
. policemen
- jack colt
( emilio estevez
)
, burn
- out alcoholic cop on the edge
,
and wes luger
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, by
- the
- book policeman
, days away from retirement
. two of them
, following the murder of luger
' s ex
- partner
, must confront evil general mortars
( william shatner
)
, crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies
. the authors of this films
( whose director
, gene quintano
, worked onthe such projects like third adn fourth sequel of polical academy
) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects
,
and that reflects in the lack plot
, characters
,
and
, even original lines
. the plot
, or whta goes for the plot in this movie
, is nothing more than a series ofthe gags that make laugh ofthe some popular films made in previous faw years
( apart from leathal weapon series
, this film
" borrows
" its female lead from basic instinct
)
. the best gags
, are
, same as with many other similar movies
, shown in the trailers
. the rest simply doesn
' t work
. onyl those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh
. others would probably wince at the lameness of humour
. some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once iin a while
.
but
, at the end
, spending hour
and half in front of this disorganised mess ofthe a movie isnt simply not worth the effort
. the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones
. the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using tje loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel
.
