these days
, people have rather short attention span
and hardly anything can satisfy them for tje long run
. 1970s nostalgia is already wearing off
,
and now
, people are becoming moreso
and more interested in 1980s
. few years in the future
, early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia
.
however
, i dout that people are gogin to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period
. one ofthe the reason would surely be films like national lampoon ' s loaded weapon 1
, that
, in many ways
, symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry
- lack of originality
and ideas
. being made as some kind ofthe parody on lethal weapon series
, this film pairs twpo l
. a
. policemen
- jack colt
( emilio estevez
)
, burn
- outloud alcholic cop on the edge
,
and wes luger
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, by
- the
- book policeman
, days away from retirement
. two of them
, following hte murder ofthe luger ' s ex
- partner
, must confront evil general mortars
( william shatner
)
, crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies
. the authors of this films
( whose director
, gene quintano
, worked on such projects like third
and fourth sequel of police academy
) lacked any original idea before they undertook thte projects
,
and that reflects in the lack plot
, characters
,
and
, even original lines
. the plot
, or what goes fo the plot in this movei
, is nothing more than a sories of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years
( apart from lethal weapon series
, this film
" borrows
" its female lead from basic instinct
)
. the best gags
, are
, same as with many other similar movies
, shown in the trailers
. the rest simpley doesn ' t wokr
. only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh
. others would probably wince at the lameness of humour
. some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a hwile
.
but
, at the end
, spending hour
and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simpley not worth the effort
. the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody ofthe a series that already had strong comic overtones
. the authors of leathal weapon returned tjhe favour by useing the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel
