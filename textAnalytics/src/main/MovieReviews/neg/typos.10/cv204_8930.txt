certainly no one would rent ed woud
' s glen or glenda
? expecting to see a good movei
,
but thsi screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a levle ofthe incompetence that i didn
' t know wass possible
. in fact
, wood
' s infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison
. watching glen or glenda
? i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies
and accidentally edited them together
; as a result
, it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious
. the movie starts out as wqat mostly seems like a bad documentary
, with endless
, repetitive narration about transvestites
, how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend
' s clothes without being able tothe wear them
, how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals
,
and how the main charater
, glen
/ glenda is
( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times
)
" not half man
and half woman
,
but man
and woman at the same time
.
" tghe camera work is terrible
- occasionally the camera lingers on
, say
, a closed doorjam while the characters talk off
- screen
, or inexplicably zooms in on someone
' s ear or nose
. wood also makes copious use ofthe mostly irrelevant stock footage
, which leads to voiced
- over non
- sequiturs like
,
" yes
, our world is a busy
and frightening place
, wiht so many people driving their automobiles
.
" finally
, there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein
- style laboratory
, delivering pointless lines such as
,
" people
.
.
. all wih their pwn
thoughts
.
.
. their own ideas
.
.
.
.
" while lightning crackles quasi
- ominously overhead
. hadnt wood continued in this vein
, glen or glenda
? probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary whith teh occasional inappropriate horror
- movie touch
. unfortunately
, he thn w
anders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had beeen eating some funny mushrooms wehn he wrote the script
.
" pull the string
! pull the string
!
" announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears
. there isnt another crash of ligthning before lugosi returns
, this time warning us
,
" beware
.
.
. beware tje big green dragon thyat lurks outside your door
!
.
.
. it eats little boys
.
.
.
and puppy dogs
' tails
.
.
.
and big fat snails
!
" a bizarre nightmare sequence
, which is probably meant to be symbolic
but instead is just incredibly stupid
, ensues
, during which glen
/ glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree
- in the living room
. someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister
" green dragon
"
(
but looks more like a klingon from the origonal star trek sories
) appears to be orchestrating all this
,
though the film is far from clear on this point
( tothe put it kindly
)
. near the end of this scene
- annd here i must confess that wood lost me completely
- is a violent sexual encounter on a couch taht features twpo charachters who do not even appear infront the rest of the movie
and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music
. after this scene ends
( not a moment too soon
)
, glen or glenda
? returns to its documentary style
,
but at that point any lingering sense that wood hadnt the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone
. the film w
anders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to ab
andon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism
,
but at that point it didn
' t matter much what happened
. as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over
, glen or glenda
? had pretty much cemented its place inthe my mind as tje most incoherent film i had ever seen
. i honestly htink that if i picked uv my camcorder anbd deliberately tried to make tghe worst movei i possibly could
, it still might nto match glen or glenda
? for sheer cinematic disaster
. i am giving this movie an f
,
but i
' m not sure thgat quite does it justice
.
