certainly no one would rent ed wood ' s glen or glenda
? expecting to see a good movie
,
bu this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a levle of incompetence that i didn ' t know was possible
. in fact
, wood ' s infamous plan 9 from outer spoace actually seems preety tame by comparison
. watching glen or glenda
? i foudn myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies
and acidentaly edited them together
; as a result
, it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious
. the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary
, with endless
, repetitive narration about transvestites
, how difficult it is fo a transvestite to look at his girlfriend ' s clothes without being able to wear them
, how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals
,
anbd how the main character
, glen
/ glenda is
( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times
)
" not half man
and half woman
,
bu man
and woman at the same time
.
" the camera wrok is terrible
- occasionally the camera lingers on
, sday
, a closed door while the characters talk off
- screen
, or inexplicably zooms in onthe someone ' s ear or nose
. wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage
, which leads to voiced
- over non
- sequiturs like
,
" yes
, our world is a busy
and frightening place
, with so many people driving their automobiles
.
" finaly
, there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein
- style laboratory
, delivering pointless lines such as
,
" people
.
.
. all with their own thoughts
.
.
. their own ideas
.
.
.
.
" while lightnnig crackles quasi
- ominously overhead
. had wood continued in this vein
, glen or glenda
? probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror
- movei touch
. unfortunately
, he
then wanders so far off into left field that yuo have tothe wonder if he hadnt been eating some funny mushrooms whn he wrote the script
.
" pull the string
! pull the string
!
" announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears
. there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns
, this time warning us
,
" beware
.
.
. beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door
!
.
.
. it eats little boys
.
.
.
adn puppy dogs ' tails
.
.
.
and big fat snails
!
" a bizzare nightmare sequence
, hwihc is probably meant to be symbolic
but instead is just incredibly stupid
, ensues
, during which glen
/ glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree
- in the living room
. someone who is aparently intended to be the sinister
" green dragon
"
(
but looks more like a klingon from tyhe original star trek series
) appears to be orchestrating all this
,
though the film is far from clear on this point
( to put it kindly
)
. near the end of this scene
-
annd here i must confess that wood lost me completely
- is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two cahracters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie
and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music
. after this scene ends
( not a moment too soon
)
, glen or glenda
? returns to its documentary style
,
but at that point any lingering sense that wood had tje slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone
. tyhe film wanders to a dumb happy ending thta also seems to abndon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism
,
but at that point it didn ' t matter much what happened
. as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over
, glen or glenda
? had pretty much cemented its palce in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen
. i honestly think tath if i picked up my camcorder
and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could
, it still might nto match glen or glenda
? for sheer cinematic disaster
. i am giving this movie an f
,
but i ' m not sure that quite does it justice
.
