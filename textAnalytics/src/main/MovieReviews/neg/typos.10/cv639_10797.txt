i
' ll be tghe first to admit it
. when you mention the book great expectations
, i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class
, where i wass confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip
and magwitch
. yes
, it
' s a classic of literature
,
but it was a rather dry one
, shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter mediciney
. certainly
, the experience wasn
' t truly that bad
,
but
, to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book
,
" i
' m not going to tell the story the way it happened
.
.
. i
' ll gonna tell it the way i remember it
.
" anyway
, to return from nostalgia lane
,
and get back to the present
, hollywood
, in it
' s trendy attempt to modernize the classics
, now presents an updated film version of grat expectations
. instead of pip
, this time the central character is named finn
( played as a boy by jeremy kissner
,
and by ethan hawke as an adult
)
. finn is an orphan bieng raised by his unfaithful sister maggie
, or should that be mrs
. joe
,
( kim dickens
)
,
and her boorish fisherman husb
and
, joe
( chris cooper
)
. the setting is the florida coast during the mid
- 70s
. finn is a blooming artist
,
and spends his time running around teh beach drawing fish
( one of his two favorite subjects
)
. during one of these escapades
, he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal
( robert deniro
)
. borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady
, deniro
' s criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity
,
and favors hiding on the ocean floor
. ok
.
.
. maybe that
' s an exaggeration
,
but he certainly beats any ofthe houdini
' s records in the opening scenes of the film
.
and that
' s nothing next tothe the fuel efficiency of finn
' s motorboat
,
but i digress
. anyway
, finn does the convict a good ded
, just to show that he
' s a really swell guy
. adn
then the plot moves on
. enter miss havisham
.
.
. or ms
. dinsmoor here
( anne bancroft
)
. ab
andoned at the altar some 26 years ago
, ms
. dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid
. with bazare clothing
, eccentric mannerisms
and a few pounds ofthe makeup
, anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role
.
al
though she ends up nowhere near a believable charcter
, she does add some humor to the film
. joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner
,
but the insane ms
. dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece
, estella
( raquel beaudene as a young girl
, gwyneth paltrow as an adult
)
. for no apparent reason
, otehr than to provide the main plot of the film
, finn is instantly stricken for the estella
. perhaps it
' s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person
, or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before
. in any case
, neither as children nor adults
, chemistry simply doesn
' t exist between the two
, anbd
yet finn spends the remainder of tje film pining for her
. even when
, as an adult
, finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor
, reacquaints himself with estella
,
and draws her portrait in the nude
, there
' s nothing
. in fact
, there is more sexual tension between helen hunt
and greg kinnear
' s gay artist during a similiar scene in as good as it gets
. at this point
, the audience has grown as cold
and detached as estella
' s character
, annd couldn
' t care less about yhe two characters
. thge bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow
. she fails to imbue estella
, a remote character in the book
, with even thge vaguest traces of humanity
. there
' s obviously something wrong when
, watching the film
, yuo
' re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character
. without a strong estella
, finn
' s obsession seems baseless
. you wish he would jstu stop whining
, let estella marry his rival
, walter plane
( an oddly subdued hank azaria
)
,
and jstu get on with his life
. in fatc
, the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot
. finn
' s relationship with his brother
- in
- law
, joe
, is interesting
, if a bit stereotypical
. waht
' s more fascinating are his interactions with deniro
.
al
though it
' s only a bit part
, it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create
. it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film
. some of the shots owrk
,
but others are too obviously staged
( for exmaple
, both of the water fountain scenes
) to have any impact
. finn
' s art
( actually the creations of itallian painter
, francesco clemente
) is used throughout the film
,
but it mostly fails to haev the intended effect
. we never see why finn would generate tihs style of art
, which is simultaneously crude
and insightful
. as a result
, it ends up as distant as tjhe rest ofthe the film
. modernizing the classics is currently in vogue
( just see william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. simply update the action to a modern setting
,
and apply plenty of modern rock
.
but such adornments do little to perk up graet expectations
. as much as i dreaded tje novel when i first read it
, you
' d probably be better off suffering
though a reading than watching this romanceless film
.
