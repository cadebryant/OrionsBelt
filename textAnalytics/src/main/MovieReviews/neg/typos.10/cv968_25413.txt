while watching loser
, it occurred to me that amy heckerling ' s true genius as a film
- maker is casting
. in fast times at ridgemont high
, she gave us sean penn ' s jeff spicoli
; in look who ' s talking
, she turned bruce willis into a wise
- cracking baby
and provided john travolta with is first career revival
; in clueless
, she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is
( or was
) alicia silverstone
. she seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws
. unfortunately
, she may also be starting to understand that she understands
. giving appealing actors an appealling script creates likeable movies
. giving appealing actors a scirpt in whic their appeal
_ is
_ the movie mkaes for unexpectedly awful films like loser
. naturally
, heckerling makes her protagonist an all
- around swell guy
. paul tannek
( jason biggs
) is a small
- town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu
,
then instantly finds himself an island ofthe compassion
and diligence in the cold
- hearted big city
. paul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman
; his roommates adam
( zak orth
)
, chris
( tom sadoski
)
and noah
( jimmi simpson
) are the kind of guys who blast their music
and let their waterbeds leak all over paul
. paul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from adar
, in this case tje lovely dora diamond
( mena suvari
)
. dora has problems of her own
, including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition
and a relationship withthe a professor
, edward alcott
( greg kinnear
)
, that ' s more than slightly one
- sided
. htey ' re two conscientious kids who love animals
and homeless people
, so clearly they belong together
, even if paul is a loser
. i must confess that
, for a while
, i was suckered in by heckerling ' s casting
. jason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace
; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence
. they ' re pleasant enough to watch
,
and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are
and how nice their respective antagonists aren ' t
.
then it gradually becomes clear that there ' s virtually nothing to loser
but scenes of that sort
. in theory
, loser is a romantic comedy
,
but there is scarcely a laugh to be found inspite the entire film
( notable exception
: a cameo by a scene
- stealing comic actor as a video store clerk
)
. instead ofthe taking any time to make the characters ' situations funny
, heckerling spends 98 mintues making her characters ' situations pathetic
. she shows none ofthe the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless
, nor any of tath film ' s interest in lively plotting
( not surprisingly
, since clueless ' s plot came via jane austen ' s emma
)
. she simply turns tje film into a pity party
. since loser isnt a film composed almost entirely of establishing character
, you might think that those characters would be interesting
, or at least slightly complicated
. instead
, you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there ' s no reason to watch them
. paul isn ' t just a nice guy
, he ' s flawess
; consequently
, he ' s a central character who does absolutely no growing
. his roommates aren ' t just inconsiderate
, they ' re actively evil
- blackmailing professor alcott
, drugging women with rohypnol
and generally giving humanity a bad name
.
and proffesor alcott isn ' t just manipulative
, he turns dora inot his house slave
. dora ' s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser
,
and even that isn ' t explored in sufficient detail
. there ' s more ambiguity in the 30
- second snippet ffrom alan cumming ' s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret
then there is inthe the rest of losr it ' s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations
; it ' s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush
.
and it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow
.
.
. i don ' t know
.
.
. comic
. still
, i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium
and justify my desire tothe like paul
and dora
. that hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon
and garfunkel ' s
" scarborough fair
/ canticle
.
" instead of giving the sequence a knowing wink
- a reference to the graduate
, a hint that paul is becomeing an overly
- sensitive clich
- heckerling plays it deadly straight
. even in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch
and a bit of a poke at her protagonist ' s foibles
, she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint
. clueless ' s cher had her self
- absorption
and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness
. in loser
, amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness
( her one show of witn involves naming paul ' s dorm
" hunt ' s hall
" aftter erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall
)
. her gift withthe casting proved to be her curse
. loser may be a crashing bore
,
but gee
, aren ' t those two kids swell
?
