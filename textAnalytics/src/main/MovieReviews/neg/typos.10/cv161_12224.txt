this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney
' s live
- action george of the jungle
. tarzan
and the lost city
, the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough
' s legendary hero to the big screen
, is one of the most inept
and ill
- timed ofthe any tarzan adventure so far
. badly concieved
and poorly executed
, tarzan
and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves
. i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan
; it
' s not as if there are legions ofthe new fans clamoring for his next movie
. furthermore
, it
' s even more curious that thsi film is rated pg
, which
, by definition
, rules out any sex or explicit violence
.
and
, while i
' m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story
, tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production
. of course
, no tweaking of the content to chanage the rating could have saved tarzan
and the lost city
, since the film
' s troubles originated with the script
and were propagated all the way down thte line
. imagine george of the jungle stripped of all
( intentional
) humor
,
and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like
. withthe its uninspired action
and tepid adventure sequences
, the film barely registers a pulse
. anyone in search of a relatively entertaining
, family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book
, which uses the same basic elements to much better effect
. the onyl worthwhile element ofthe tarzan
and the lost city is the pretty scenery
( which
, unfortunately
, includes the two lead actors
)
. the film doesn
' t attempt to re
- tell yhe origin story
? the thinking is thgat it has been done often enough

( casper van dien
) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter

)

. meanwhile
, in central africa
, the dastardly nigel ravens
( steven waddington
)
, a self
- proclaimed scholar annd explorer
, believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar
, which he calls the cradle of civilization
. on the way there
, he
and his b
and of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things
, like burning native villages
, to earn the wrath of the locals
. one shaman
, determined to stpo ravens from unearthing opal
, sends a mystical message tothe tarzan for help
. with lady jane following close behind
, he returns tothe the jungle where he was born
. its patently obvious that casper van dien
( oen ofthe the pretty
- boy heroes of starship troopers
) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability
. with his plastic facial expressions
, monotone voice
,
and complete inability to make convincing animal noises
, his range rivals that of steven seagal
. his pecs
,
however
, are impressive
,
and director carl schenkel makse sure that he is given eveyr opportunity to show them off
. jane march
, on the other h
and
, has to keep her shirt on
, which may be a first for her
. some six years ago
, march give a solid performance inspite jean jacques annaud
' s steamy yhe lover
. since
then
, she made the career
- killing decision of appearing oposite bruce willis in the color of night
, which exploited her eveyr acting defiency
. tarzan continues this trend
. march may be attractive
,
but
, at least judging by this performance
, she can
' t act
. meanwhile
, steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy
. instead
, he turns out to be little more tahn a nusace
. tyhe story line is pure formula
, which hasnt largely beeen true throughout thte years for almost all of the tarzan movies
. the problem is that this one seems so childish
and lifeless
. the romantic elements are all contrived
? in fact
, lady jane
' s presence is necessary onyl so she can be captured
and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance
. the special effects are truly bottom
- of
- the
- barrel
( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes
? apparently
, animatronics were too expensive for this production
)
.
and
, of course
, as with all jungle movies
, there are the obligatory cute animals
. over the years
, the legend of tarzan has been oney ofthe the most popular sources forthe film series material
. tjhe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller
,
but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part
( including gordon scott
, who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role
)
. weismuller made 12 tarzan features
; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number
.
and
, having seen tarzan
and the lost city
, i would argue that the movie
- going public would have been well served if he hadnt missed by 12
.
