welcome to your oh
- so typical sequel
. it tries to be twice as big as it
' s predecessor
,
yet ends up twice as shallow
. shallow
.
.
.
. hmm
.
.
. now there
' s an idea
. maybe if the ill
- fated cruise liner in this movie had struck a shallow reef early on things may have turned outloud better
. the first thing that struck me
.
.
.
and surprised me
, was that the camera work
( for the oppening sequence anyway
) was terrible
. looked like the cameramen were drunk
and kept tripping on their own feet
.
.
.
.
.
. very different to the original movie
. the charactors
? well
, not many of the characters actually
* had
* characters
,
but here
' s a rundown
. annie
, who was the highlight of the the original
, must have seriously banged her head in the train crash at the end of the first movie
. why
? because something
' s got to account for her loseing that many iq points
. even
though annie wasn
' t exactly a rocket scientist in speed
, here some ofthe her actions just make you want to beat your head against a wall
. forthe instance
, after successfully using a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of people can escape noxious gases
- she st
ands in the middle of the opening for about five minutes till someone reminds her that the people can
' t get ut till she get
' s the chainsaw out of their faces
.
.
.
. bang beng bang in point of fact s
andra
' s character is turned into little more than one of those scantly dressed extras from hercules
, who constantly has to be rescued
. jason patric
? all i can say isnt bring bcak keanu
. keanu reeves might have the emotional range ofthe a tree stump
.
.
.
but that
' s one more tree stump than jason has
. i don
' t think he changed facial expressions all movie
- jason
, smile for the cameras
!
! now frown
!
.
.
. i said frown
.
.
.
. oh
.
.
. you are
.
.
. bang bang bang
.
. wooden just doesn
' t describe this guys performance
,
but it
' ll have to do
. the bad guy
.
.
.
.
. ahh
.
.
. william dafoe
- there
' s a bright move
. how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledged classic
, body of evidence
?
( yes
, thyat is sarcasm
)
. his wide eyed maniac of a character doesn
' t strat out too bad
.
.
.
.
but goes steadily downhill as the movie progresses
. in the end he degenerates to chasing annie around for a hostage
, even
though he already has the money
and can escape
.
.
.
. bang bang
.
though i
' d like to give this movie a double thumbs down
, there were some nice sequences
. considering yhe movie cost over 100 million dollars
- you
' d hope there
' d be at least a couple
. the real eye
- popper for me
, even
though it was given away iin the trailer
.
.
.
. bang bang
.
.
.
.
. was the sequence where the cruise liner sideswipes the oil tanker
. this looks terrific
and i was veyr surprised to hear thgat the cruise liner in it was
.
.
.
. completely cmoputer generated
! wow
.
.
.
. i don
' t think i
' ve ever seen a cg model look so real before
. the sequence where jason patric in trying to disable the propellers from under the ship is also terrific
,
and the only time during the entire movei where you get that feeling of
.
.
.
. speed
. this lack
- of
- speed problem affects many sequences
. such as the oil tanker part
.
.
.
.
. it was
-
" oh no
, we
' re going to hit the oil tanker
!
"
, 20 minutes later
-
" oh noone
, we
' re going to hit yhe oil tanker
!
" 20 min
.
.
.
. you get the point
. this movie failed simply because it didn
' t live up to it
' s name
.
.
.
. htere was vyer little feeling of speed
. in the original movie
, the lead characters had to make split second decisions to survive
.
.
.
.
. in this movie it felt more like
-
" well people
, we
' re gonna run into that there isl
and in a few housr
- i think i might stroll over to engineering
and see if i can
' t turn off the engines
.
.
. i
' m passing the cafeteria on the way
, can i get anybody anything
?
" the ending of this movie really isnt terrible
. even
though it features what i
' ve since found out is one of thge most expensive sequences ever in a movie
- it just doesn
' t work at all
. the part where the liner crashes through the town looks very realsitic
,
but
.
.
.
. surprise surprise
- it just takes waaaaay too long
. it seemed to go forthe 15 minutes before the ship fianlly stopped
. oney thing that struck me as extremely poor scriptiing was that as the ship crashes through the harbour
and town
, around 25 people are killed by the ship
.
.
.
.
and there
' s only 15 or so people left on the ship
. so when it stops safe adn sound
and the characters are all cheering
- the audience is sitting back
and thinking
-
" wait a sec
.
.
. this is a happy moment because
?
" beng bang
then there was yhe dog
.
.
.
.
. i almost fell out of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodging the falling debris
. putting a dog in peril has become the ultimate hollywood cliche
.
.
.
.
.
. every movie seems to have a
' dog
- iin
- danger
' sequence
- volcano
, dante
' s peak
, independence day
, daylight
, twister
. lost world
.
.
.
.
.
. etc
, etc
. this movie is a perfect exemple of how not to make a sequel
. directer jan de bont should try watching the orignal movei
and this one bakc
- to
- back
and see if he realises where he went wrong
.
