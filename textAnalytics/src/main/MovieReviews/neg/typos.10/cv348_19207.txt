the happy bastard
' s quick movei review wild wild west a better name fo this movie might
' ve been
" wild wild waste
"
. warner bros
.
, in an attempt to get their own men in balck style of movie
, had managed tothe lasso in some big names
( actor will smith
and director barry sonnenfeld
, the duo behind mib
' s sucess
) in order to get their pwn fourth of july blockbuster
, a contemporary big
- screen update to the classic western
/ sci
- fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad
.
but somehow
, they ran into a problem along the way
. they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would
' ve made all the difference
- a story writer
. wild wild west
' s story
and script was compiled by six different people
, rather tahn just the one who put tje brilliant touches on men in black
, ed solomon
. if warner bros
. had gotten him
, the movei would
' ve possibly been five times better thna what it is
. heck
, ten times
. as is
,
however
, the story
and screenplay is a mess
, filled with dead laughs
, enough racist
and sex jokes to make even wiull cringe as he
' s performing them
,
and a complet lack of chemestry that made the tv show work so well
. here
' s the story
: us army memeber james west
( wiull smith
) teams uv with creative genius artemus gordon
( kevin kline
) to take on a ruthless villain by the nmae of arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, whose lower half was blown off during the civil war
, leaving him to roll around in a steam
- controlled wheelchair
. tehy catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80
- foot tarantula
(
al
though it looks bigger than that
)
, hellbent onthe destroying anything in its path
. as i said
, the way the script unfolds is a complete mess
.
but the acting doesn
' t help either
. kevin kline isnt miserable as gordon
, failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he doed in the 1985 western silverado
. smith seems to be having a better time as west
,
al
though he
' s not nearly as charming as he was in mib
. branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain
, perhaps tothe the point where we can
' t even st
and tothe look at him or his strange beard
.
and salma hayek is along for teh ride to esarch for her missing father
,
but mostly she exists just for sexual attension
. her acting is barely passable
,
but what a
" breath of fresh ass
"
. director barry sonnenfeld isn
' t ofthe great help either
. even
though he shows soem good creativity at some points
, his overall urgency for directing is lost
. it
' s as if he feels he
' s directing a tv movie
, a big no
- no when ytou
' re helming what
' s supposed to be a big
- screen hit
. last
but not least
, there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable
. at one point
, smith defies gravity when first boarding kline
' s train
. he jumps on the back
, gets launched straight up in the air
, anbd somehow manages to l
and three cars ahead on the train
- while it
' s still in motion
! also
, he seems to be strangely confortable talking baout racism in front of a lynch mob
, particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks
. last
but not least
, why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he
' s nto kissing a woman as he
' s looking through a peephole at the enemy
?
! the only saving grace forthe wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects
. tje huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel
, very au
thentic looking
and considerable to the creativity of the show
. there
' s also a good sequence involving metal magnant neckbraces
and spinning saw blades
,
but
, again
, a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity
. i would say sit back
and have a good time with wild wild west
,
but it really isn
' t possible
. if the racist
and sex jokes don
' t bother you
, the performances iwll
. if the performances don
' t bother you
, the story will
. if the story doesn
' t bother you
, the racist
and sex jokes will
. there
' s no end to the vicious circle
. go rent men in black instade
and pretend smith
and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats
. you
' ll ahve a better time
. if you do go
, keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant
. i bet he wishes he were somewhere else
