by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer
, it
' s possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one
. action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup
. audience members who crave more intellectual fare wiull be disgusted by the film
' s sudden collapse into mindless storytelling annd by the ending
, wich is an insulting cop
- out
. somewhere out there
, maybe there
' s a small cadre of film
- goers who will appreciate sphere
' s dubious charms
,
but i
' m not among them
. i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie
( i noone longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham
)
, baceause if the finished motion picture product is anytying to go by
, it
' s hard to underst
and why the rights were optioned
. sphere is the kind ofthe first
- class mess that only a top
- line director with an a
- list cast can create
. with expectations high
( anbd how could they not be
, considering that another barry levinson
/ dustin hoffman collaboration
, yhe exelent wag the dog
, isnt still playing in theaters
?
)
, something this bad can
' t help
but look even worse
. the last time a big
- name
, big
- budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year
' s batman
& robin
,
and everyone knows how that movie ws recived
. sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact
and james cameron
' s the abyss
,
but
, somewhere allong the way
, it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort
, event horizon
. science
and philisophy
, which are used to good effect during sphere
' s first hour
, give way to mindless
, confusing action sequences
. attempts at characterization fall apart
. intelligent writing
, which is evident early on
, is replaced by hackneyed drivel
. speshal effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness
. bu all that is jstu in preparation for the ending
, which is inexcusably awful
. tihs is the time
- honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect
. i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton
and his screenwriters had chosen tothe end the film
. there is some promise
, bu it
' s all in the setup
. we
' re inctroduced to norman goodman
( dustin hoffman
)
, a psychologist who once wrote a
$ 35
, 000 report for the government about what to do in the event thta a crashed space ship is dicovered
. when one is found in the middle ofthe nowhere
, 1000 feet below the surface of tyhe pacific ocean
, norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee
. on the team with him are beth halperin
( sharon stone
)
, a biochemist who was once his student
and lover
; harry adams
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18
; ted fielding
( liev schreiber
)
, an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technnology
;
and harold barnes
( peter coyote
)
, the government operative in charge of the mission
. together
, the five descend into the bowels of the ocean
, where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact
. forthe a while
, sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man
- meets
- alien situation
. the overall scenario is not without promise
and several plot twists
( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship
, apparently from tjhe future
) offer intriguing possibilities
.
then
, right around teh one
- hour mark
( that
' s the time to sneak into the theater next door
and check out whatever
' s left of titanic
)
, tghe virtualy non
- stpo acation begins
,
and
, once it starts
, the script becomes superfulous
. this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitmate tension
,
but
, instead
, he relies onthe loud
, overbearing music
, strange camera angles
,
and quick cuts tothe make things
" exciting
.
" additionally
, becuase none ofthe the characters are well
- formed
( a common failing in anything penned by crichton
, who
' s more interested in technology than people
)
, viewers don
' t develop much ofthe a rooting interest
. it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating
and pointless experience
. what about that a
- list cast
? not surprizingly
, the most energetic performance is given by samuel l
. jackson
,
but his harry isn
' t a person
; he
' s a walking plot device spouting occasionally
- witty dialogue
. dustin hoffman isn
' t livley or particularly good
-
- it
' s ironic thyat this
, which may be his worst work inwhich a decade
, has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination
( for wag the dog
)
. sharon stone
and peter coyote are both flat
. theri characters exhibit little evidence of emotion
; automatons would have been as effective
.
then there
' s queen latifa
, who
, despite getting fifth billing in the credits
( ahead of liev schreiber
, who boasts at least quadruple her screen timne
)
, has less than a h
andful of lines
and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count
. i like to think that levinson
and hoffman
, recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be
, chose tothe make wag the dog as a sort ofthe penance
( the low
- budget picture was filmed during sphere
' s lengthy pre
- production phase
)
. if that
' s the case
, forgiveness is granted
. i
' m less inclined to look favorably upon crichton
,
al
though he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume
( jurassic park
and the levinson
- directed disclosure come to mind
)
. even if his novel was
butchered in the adaptation process
, crichton
' s credit as a producer disallows him absolution
. he was a willing participant in a creative travesty
. noone wonder sphere is being released in february
, in the midst of the early year
' s cinematic wastel
and
. it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic
, which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth
- consecutive weekend atop the box office heap
.
