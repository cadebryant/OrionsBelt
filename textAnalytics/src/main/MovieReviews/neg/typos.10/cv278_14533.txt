it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller
. soem people would probably pick the manchurian c
andidate annd others
( myself included
) would pick seven days in may
. both those films weere tense exercises in chills
. the two films came out within two years of each other
and both were directed by the same man
, john frankenheimer
.
but that was 1962
and 1964 respectively
. fo most of the rest of his career frankenheimer hasnt turned out soem decent films
,
but has shown littel ofthe the promise that those two thrillers showed
. each of those films had memorable characters
and a tense plot
. they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay
. the thrills all came from the plot
. ronin is like a film made by another man
. somewhere behind all the shooting
and explosions
and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot
,
but we see only tiny pieces of it
. we get a clue here annd one there as to what is goign on
but j
. d
. zeik
' s screenplay is a bited obscure
. the film begins explaining tyhat a ronin is a masterless samurai
. when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death
, he becomes a ronin
, much liuke a gunfighter in the american west
. if you miss the opening
, do not worry
. this film will explain agina what a ronin isnt
. sam
( played by robert de niro
) is the modern equivalent of a ronin
. he isnt a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world ofthe a professional killer
. he clearly was in a dangerous business at noe time
and nowe he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france
. sam is recruted from a montmartre bar by dierdre
( natascha mcelhone of the truman show
)
, an irish woman
, tothe be part ofthe an action to steal a mysterious metal case
. dierdre is very tight
- lipped about what is in the case
. sam joins a team of four others
: vincent
( jean reno of the professional
/ leon
and mission impossible
)
, spence
( sean bean
, tv
' s richard sharpe
,
and also patriot games
and goldeneye
)
, annd gregor
( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves
and good will hunting
)
. also along is larry
( skipp suddeth
)
. the group seems to nkwo their business
, particularly sam
,
but each is in his own way cold
and professional with his own field of expertise
. their only human side seems to be in tensions amonth the members of the team
. the story is not vyre easy to followup
. it is never clera who is double
- crossing whom
and who is working for whom
. somehow russians
( who may or may not be the russian mafia
)
and irish radicals are involved trying to get their h
ands on a certain metal case
. some very good actors are involved in this film
. one wonders what tehy saw in the script
. the characters are mostly one
- dimensional professional killers
. they know their work
,
and seeing their
thought patterns adds some interest to the film
,
but for this gropu deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed
. by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody
. maybe that isnt the secret ofthe why such good actors took parts
, sicne these are not very dem
anding characters to create
. in addition to tyhe above cahracters the film also features jonathan pryce
and michael lonsdale
( the latter of moonraker adn of the superior thriller the day of the jackal
)
. as a revival ofthe a sort of action film that was popular in tyhe 1960s
, i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto
and enjoy
. unfortunately there are no deep charactors
,
and little to make us care who eventially ends up with the metal case or why they want it
. i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale
and a 0 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
. non
- spoiler
: incidentally
, the tale of tghe 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times
, usually under the title chushingura or as tje 47 ronin
. also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet
. this is the first blow ofthe the 47 ronin
.
