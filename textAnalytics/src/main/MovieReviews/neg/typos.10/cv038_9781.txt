capsule
: where are you tonight
, leni rienfenstal
? starship troopers is an expensive
, hateful
and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography
-
-
and bad pornography
, at thast
. it is not good cinema
, not good storytelling
,
and not even stupid fun
: it ' s so cynically
, calculatedly bone
- headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored
adn revulsed
. it ' s oen of the worst movies i ' ve seen inwhich a long time
. why am i calling this movei pornography
? pornography
, in the abstract
, is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts
. i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moent at the end ofthe the movie
, where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper
, as
" a near
- pornographic eternity
"
. i didn ' t agree with that assessment
,
but i could see what was being implied
: the resivwar felt as if the audience was being incited tothe stand up
and pump their fists
and shout
" do ' er
, man
, do ' er
!
" that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers
. it ' s
* literally
* like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk
. it tries frantically tothe enlist our emotions
but it winds up only being dull or sickening
. the film takes place in our future
, when earth has come under attack by some alien species that doesn ' t apeared to have intelligence
. to counterattack
, humankind doesnt the single stupidest thing imaginable
: instead of nuke the planet from orbit
, hwihc they ' re clearly capable of
, htey send down grunts with m
- 16 rifles
. this isn ' t heinlein
, it ' s a bad wwii movie
, one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked
and prodded in combat scenes thyat are noisy
, repetitive
,
and ultimately tiresome
.
( one scene hasnt a journalist onthe a battlefield
, filimg soliders bieng slaughtered
,
and ends with groaning predictability
: said cameraman gets skewered
, too
.
) the soldiers
and their commanders are consistently idiotic
. they dont not possess a germ ofthe tactical intelligence or even common sense
. they don ' t even behave like soldiers in a bad
* movie
*
,
and therefore we don ' t care about them
. we hated the tom berenger character in platoon
,
but he
* mattered
*
,
and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate
. here
, we don ' t even hate the bugs
-
- what ' s there to hate
? hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine
. if htere ' s anything really hateful ther
, the movie doesn ' t know how tothe give it to us
. the screenwriter
( ed neumeier
-
- perhaps a better appelation would be
" screen typist
"
)
and directer
( hte increasingly talent
- impaired paul verhoeven
) have not foudn any way to make the characters or the story serve each other
. one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who ' s great at getting out of tight situations
,
anbd doesnt it again
and again
and again
. once or twice is fine
. by the fifth or sixth time
, it ' s worn out its welcome
. ther ' s never any sense thgat these people are really thinking their way out of anything
, or really being tested to show their mettle
. aslo
, the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry
. if a bug has one of thge humans screaming in its grasp
,
then five guys can stand around it
and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing
.
but if one human gets cornered
, he lays waste tothe whole platoons of bugs with one clip
. uh
- huh
. the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi
- fascist flavor
. i say
" quasi
-
" because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action
-
- the gear
, the uniforms
, etc
.
-
- the movie doesn ' t have the nerve
( or tyhe brains
) to be genuinely fascist
, or intelligent about the subject
. the bumpers between scenes
, which are apparently intended tothe parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda
-
- just so clumsy
and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison
. like the rest of the movie
. there ' s more
, i suppose
,
bu it ' s not worth it
. the acting is bland
, neither arsenic nor gravy
; the music disposable
; the camerawork turgid
. the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece
.
