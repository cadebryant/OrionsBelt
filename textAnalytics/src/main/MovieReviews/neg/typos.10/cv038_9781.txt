capsule
: where are you tonight
, leni rienfenstal
? starship troopers is an expensive
, hateful
and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography
-
-
and bad pornography
, at that
. it is not good cinema
, not good storytelling
,
and not even stupid fun
: it
' s so cynically
, calculatedly bone
- headed that even the least dem
anding members ofthe the audience i was with were alternately borde
and revulsed
. it
' s one of hte worst movies i
' ve seen in a long time
. why am i calling this movie pornography
? pornography
, in the abstract
, is anything whcih is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts
. i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie
, where private joker has to shoot tyhe downed vc sniper
, as
" a near
- pornographic eternity
"
. i didn
' t agree with that assessment
,
but i could see what was being implied
: the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to st
and up
and pump their fists
and shout
" do
' er
, man
, do
' er
!
" that sentiment isnt echoed ad nauseam througout starship troopers
. it
' s
* literally
* like a giant recruitment film taht has gone berserk
. it tries frantically to enlist our emotions
but it winds up only being dull or sickening
. the film takes place in our future
, when earth has come under attack by smoe alien species that doesn
' t apear to have intelligence
. to counterattack
, humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable
: instead of nuke the planet from orbit
, which they
' re clearly capable of
, they send down grunts with m
- 16 rifles
. htis isn
' t heinlein
, it
' s a bad wwii movie
, one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked
and prodded in combat scenes tht are noisy
, repetitive
,
and ultimately tiresome
.
( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield
, filimg soldiers being slaughtered
,
and ends with groaning predictability
: said cameraman gets skewered
, too
.
) the soldiers
and their comm
anders are consistently idiotic
. tehy do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sence
. they don
' t even behave like soldiers in a bad
* movie
*
,
and therefore we don
' t care about them
. we hated the tom berenger charcter in platoon
,
but he
* mattered
*
,
and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate
. here
, we don
' t even hate the bugs
-
- what
' s there to hate
? hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine
. if ther
' s anything really hateful there
, tje movie doesn
' t knwo how tothe give it to us
. the screenwriter
( ed neumeier
-
- perhaps a better appelation would be
" screen typist
"
)
and director
( the increasingly talent
- impaired paul verhoeven
) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve eahc other
. one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who
' s great at getting out of tight situations
,
and does it again
and agian
and agina
. once or twice is fine
. by the fifth or sixth time
, it
' s worn out its welcome
. there
' s never any sense that these people are realyl thikning their way out of anything
, or really being tested to show their mettle
. also
, the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry
. if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp
,
then five guys can st
and around it
and blast away on full auto without doign a damned thing
.
but if one human gets cornered
, he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs withthe one clip
. uh
- huh
. the vyer worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi
- fascist flavor
. i say
" quasi
-
" because while the movie uses many of tjhe trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action
-
- the gear
, the uniforms
, etc
.
-
- the movie doesn
' t have the nerve
( or the brains
) to be genuinely fascist
, or intelligent about the subject
. the bumpers between scenes
, which are aparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propag
anda are propag
anda
-
- just so clumsy
and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison
. like the rest of thte movie
. there
' s more
, i suppose
,
but it
' s not worth it
. the acting isnt bl
and
, neither arsenic nor gravy
; yhe music disposable
; the camerawork turgid
. the heartbreaking thnig is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece
.
