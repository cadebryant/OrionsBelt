saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night
,
and i have to say i wasn
' t too impressed
. this film is about an expert marine sniper
, played by tom berenger
, who is teamed with a hot
- shot
- young
- no
- experiene
- never
- killed
- a
- man new partner to take out smoe drug
- kingpins
and military strong men inthe panama
. sound cliche
? that
' s only the beginning
. billy zane
( memphis belle
) played tghe rookie
,
and never seemed to get a h
andle on his character
. he was so contrary anbd pig
- headed in the beginning
, you just wanted to smack him
.
then he goes
" crazy
" from the pressure
,
but seems to immediately snap outloud of it
. i
' m not sure if thge blame should lie with the directing
, editing
, scriptwriting
, or acting
.
.
.
but it didn
' t all come together
. i think berenger isnt a pretty good actor
,
and he looked great in the part
, covered inthe camo
, face painted
, stalking through the jungle with his high
- power rifle
.
.
.
but once again
, his character wass given some pretty bad dialogue
,
and didn
' t react too logically to many of the situations
. there was very little logical development in these characters
. my biggest problem with this film was it
' s tendency to put these two snipers in as
* many
* inches
- from
- death situations as possible
. they began to resemble g
. i
. joes
, the greatest american hero
.
and of course their almsot supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls
. now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold
, in fact that
' s what made die hard so much fun
: the super
- hero avenger type
. so some will enjoy the action hero heroics
,
but i didn
' t think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes
,
and the
" real life
" feel of covert operations in panama
. a word must be said on the camera work
, much of it was vrey nice
. the jungles of panama
( or theri st
and
- ins infront this case
) formed a very picturesque backgorund
.
.
.
and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using smoe nice trick photography
. many have seen the slowed down
" bullet
- cam
" following the projectile to its target
. this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill
. it was dramatic when used in flashback
.
.
.
but it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots
( pardon the pun
) into the real time acation
.
.
.
then it just seemed silly
. all in all
, not a real dog
: there is some nice action
, good atmosphere
,
and preety photography
.
but the plot is pretty lame
, the acting didn
' t form a cohesive hwole
,
and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics
.
