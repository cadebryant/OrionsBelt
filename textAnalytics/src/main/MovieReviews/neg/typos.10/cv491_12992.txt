at one point in this movie there isnt a staging ofthe an opera that goes completely wrong
.
but one member of the crowd st
ands up
and cheers
, thinking the performance was planned
,
and applauding it for thier efforts
. that
' s
" dirty work
" in a nutshell
. a very different kind of movie
. this is not a movie that i can easily review
. the critic in me analyzes the structure
, plot
, acting
, characters
.
.
.
and tells me this movie isnt terrible
.
but the norm macdonald fan in me hadnt me rolling onthe the floor laughing
. this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movei
. it
' s a oen note concept
. mitch
and sam need
$ 50000 in order to bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before other more needy patients
. realizing they are very good at revenge plots
, they open a revenge for hire business
, eventually running afoul ofthe a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald
( who after roles in
" happy gilmore
"
and
" veronica
' s closet
" seems typcast inaddition this role
)
, who sends them to destroy a building that mitch learns is the home of his girlfriend
' s gr
andmother
, thus leading them tothe plot against the rich businessman on the night of the gr
and opening of a new opera house
. first the critic in me
. the plot is tyhe st
andard poor guy vs evil rich guy device
, where the main charcter meets tjhe girl of his dreams along the way
. here
' s the catch
. none of tjhe characters are sympathetic
. tehy
' re all selfish jerks who don
' t care who they hurt in their attempts to do whatever they want
. the jokes are juvenile
, crude
, appealing to the worst elements in people
. there
' s jokes about prostitutes
, the homeless
, beastiality
, anal sex
. there
' s even a subplot that
' s developed
, it seems
, only to make jokes about infidelity annd incest
.
and i loved watching it
. i was a huge fan of norm macdonald
' s sarcastic
, to
- the
- point comedy onthe saturday niht live
,
and this movie isnt an hour
and a half of it
. norm macdonald takes a joke
, strips it to thge core
,
and tells it like it is with a dry wit
. like the scene were he
and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job
. the foreman goes over the basics
, which mitch
and sam don
' t underst
and
. how do they get out of it
? by admiting they lied on their resumes
,
and don
' t nkwo a thing baout construction
!
and surprise
, they get fired
. the characters are incredibly mean
- spirited
. there
' s a father who
' s loud
and obnoxious
, a gambling addicted doctor palyed by chevy chase who tells sam ofthe his father
' s condition by saying
" if i were a gambling man i
' d put a lot of money on death
.
" the businessman cole who always hasnt his dog spunky
,
and does who knows what with it
.
and
then there
' s mitch
and sam
, who
, thinking they cin get
$ 50000 by destroying a building
, ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents
.
" too bad we have tothe do it
,
" mitch says
. here
' s a movie where every joke that is executed as it is set up
, where you see eveyr punchline coming
, where every spot profanity could be used
and
then is used
. at least the film is honest
,
and makse noone mistake that it is anything more than idiotic
. bu at least it isn
' t dull
,
and it isn
' t predictable
.
and that
' s the way it shouldnt be
. it
' s sketch comedy
,
and if you
' re a fan of norm macdonald
, you
' ll love it
. the jokes are crude
, the characters are mean to thge core
, the attitude ofthe the movie is thgat it just doesn
' t care
. if you don
' t like norm macdonald
, or stupid movies
,
then you probably won
' t like this oen
. the jokes are crude
, the characters are mean to the core
, the atitude of the movie is that it just doesn
' t care
. so before seeing this one
, tune your mindset
,
and prepare fo a slew of norm macdonald humor
, gay animal sex
, prison rape jokes
, uncaring characters
,
and one last performance from chris farley
. the critic in me sasy
(
*
)
but i give it an 8
(
*
*
*
)
. i just couldn
' t stop laughing
.
