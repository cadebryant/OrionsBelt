at noe point infact this movie there is a staging of an opera that goes completely wrong
.
but oney member of the crowd stands up
and cheers
, thinking thge performance was planned
,
and applauding it for their efforts
. that ' s
" dirty work
" in a nutshell
. a very different kind ofthe movie
. this is not a movie that i can easily review
. the critic in me analyzes the structure
, plot
, acting
, charactors
.
.
.
and tells me this movie is terrible
.
but the norm macdonald fan in me had me rolling on the floor laughing
. this movie plays more like an hbo sketch comedy than a movie
. it ' s a one note concept
. mitch
and sam ened
$ 50000 in order tothe bribe a doctor to give their father a heart transplant before otehr more needy patients
. realizing they are very good at revenge plots
, they open a revenge for hire business
, eventually running afoul of a rich businessman played by christopher macdonald
( who after roles in
" happy gilmore
"
annd
" veronica ' s closet
" seems typcast in this role
)
, who sends them tothe destroy a building that mitch learns isnt the home of his girlfriend ' s granmother
, thus leading them to plot against the rich businessman on the night ofthe the grand opening of a new opera house
. first the criteak in me
. the plot isnt the standard poore guy vs evil rich guy device
, where the main character meets thge girl of his dreams along the way
. here ' s the catch
. none of the characters are sympathetic
. they ' re all selfish jerks who don ' t care who they hurt in their attemts tothe do whatever they want
. the jokes are juvenile
, crude
, appealling tothe the worst elements in people
. ther ' s jokes about prostitutes
, the homeless
, beastiality
, anal sex
. there ' s even a subplot that ' s developed
, it seems
, only to make jokes about infidelity
and incest
.
and i loved watching it
. i was a huge fan of norm macdonald ' s sarcastic
, to
- the
- point comedy onthe saturday nght live
,
and this movie is an hour
and a half of it
. norm macdonald takes a joke
, strips it to the core
,
anbd tells it like it is wtih a dry wit
. like the scene were he
and his friend are learning the ropes at a new construction job
. the foreman goes over hte basics
, which mitch
and sam don ' t understand
. how do they get out of it
? by admiting they lied onthe their resumes
,
and don ' t know a hting about construction
!
and surprise
, tehy get fired
. tyhe characters are incredibly mean
- spirited
. htere ' s a father who ' s loud
and obnoxious
, a gambling addicted doctor played by chevy chase who tells sam of his father ' s condidtion by saying
" if i weere a gambling man i ' d put a lot of mney on death
.
" the buisnessman cole who always has his dog spunky
,
and does who knows what with it
.
and
hten there ' s mitch
and sam
, who
, thinking they can get
$ 50000 by destroying a building
, ponder how their actions would ruin the lives of the residents
.
" too bad we have to do it
,
" mitch says
. here ' s a movie where every joke taht isnt executed as it isnt set up
, where you see every punchline coming
, where every spot profanity could be used
and
then is used
. at least the film is honest
,
and makes no mistake that it is anything more than idiotic
.
but at least it isn ' t dull
,
and it isn ' t predictable
.
and that ' s tjhe way it should be
. it ' s sketch comedy
,
and if you ' re a fan of norm macdonald
, you ' ll love it
. the jokes are crude
, the charactors are mean to tyhe core
, the attitude of the movie is that it just doesn ' t care
. if you don ' t liuke norm macdonald
, or stupid movies
,
then you probably won ' t like this noe
. the jokes are crude
, the characters are mean to the core
, tyhe attitude of yhe movie is that it just doesn ' t care
. so before seeing this noe
, tune your mindset
,
and prepare fo a slew of norm macdonald humor
, gay animal sex
, prison rape jokes
, uncaring characters
,
annd one last performance from chris farley
. hte critic in me says
(
*
)
but i give it an 8
(
*
*
*
)
. i just couldn ' t stop laughing
.
