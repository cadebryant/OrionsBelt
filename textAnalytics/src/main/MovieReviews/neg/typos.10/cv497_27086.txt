this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard
. the rock
and roller is asked to carry the film as the acation antihero of australian legend
.
.
. ned kelly
, the so
- called robin hood of the aussies
.
but he fails to be convincing
, in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly
. the film opens to a b
/ w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution
.
then it goes to technicolor
annd ned isnt seen in what goes for flashback
, comming home from jail after a 3
- year sentence to see his mom
and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family
. this scene is set inaddition 1871
. in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings
, as he sings shel silverstein ' s lyrics
, which tells
-
- of ned ' s hatred for the british rule
and hope for ireland to be a republic
. ned says a debt must be paid
.
.
. as he hears voices from his dead father
, his class
- divided country
,
and his conscience
, all telling him to get revenge
. so begins ned ' s romp through australia ' s outback
, seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered
. he begins by stealing horses
, after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray
, which favors the rich landowners
. when he ' s onyl 20 he forms a gang
, causing him to hide the rest ofthe his life ffrom the police
, who put a price on his head of twpo thousand pounds
. whn ned ' s mother
( clarissa kaye
) is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals
and sentenced to 3
- 5 years
, ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother ' s freedom
. when the authorities refuse
, the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage
, burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults
and murdering some soldiers
. rampaging through the outback
, they gather simapthy amonst the poor
and lower classes
, who don ' t trust the traps
( police
)
. spoiler to follow in the next paragraph
. in the climax
, kelly
and his gang plan tothe ambush a train with british police
,
but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train
and kelly isnt trapped in a saloon
annd captured
. ned ' s brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive
.
but kelly ' s gang escapes
, as ned heroically has the police go after only him
and his brothers
, as they become decoys
. this was a flat presentation
, hardly touching an emotional button on what all thge fuss was about over ned kelly ' s call for justice
. jagger didn ' t have a prayer in succeeding inaddition this dry script offered by ian jones
and tony richardson
. tjhe story failed tothe focus on australia
, seemingly a more british film thna australian
. under richardson ' s lackluster direction
, all jagger seemed to do
, was proclaim his innocence
and vow revenge
, which soon became a shrill cry
. if you want to see a better film about ned kelly
, catch
" mad dog morgan
"
( 76
)
, a much truer
and more daring version
, with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly ' s madness
, something this film could only do in a ho
- hum manner
.
