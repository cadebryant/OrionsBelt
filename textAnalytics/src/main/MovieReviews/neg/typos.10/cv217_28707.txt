the swirling sick feeling hit me just a few mintues into
" heartbreakers
.
" ray liotta ' s character was making out with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office
. while scrambling to collect himself
, he frantically shouted to her
,
" just wait a sex
? er
, i mean sec
!
" i was struck by a wave of revulsion
, thinking
,
" geez
, didn ' t lines like that die whn ' three ' s company ' was canceled
?
" over the next few minutes
, as the barely double entendres
and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous
, i realized that the mindset behind
" heartbreakers
" predated
" three ' s company
.
" suddenly
, i had an out
- of
- body experience as my internal way
- back machine swept me to the mid
- 1960s
. all across america
, tghe counter
- culture was growing liuke wildfire
,
but there was scant evidence of it on tv
. while young people were challenging traditional values on the streets
, frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at home
, sulking while our parents enjoyed thte latest bob hope special
. women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises
and leered at their breasts
. on another channel
, dean martin made wisecracks about
" booze
and broads
"
and peter lawford
, decked out in loev beads
and a nehru jacket
, purred suggestive one
- liners as he ogled the go
- go dancers
. the adults laughed
and laughed
.
" heartbreakers
" reeks of that stagnant mentality
, from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt ' s vah
- vah
- voom breasts to its leaden screenplay
, which paints women as haughty schemers
and men as drooling buffoons too sex
- obsessed to realize they are being manipulated
. in addition to liotta
and hewitt
, the cast includes sigourney weaver
, gene hackman
, jason lee
, nora dunn
and anne bancroft
. i can ' t imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project
. prehaps they thought it ws a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the ' 60s
. if so
, they were sadly mistaken
. the story revolves around a mother
- daughter con
- team
. it opens with the marriage of max
( weaver
) to dean
( liotta
)
, a new jersey chop shop operator
. having withheld sex until the honeymoon
, max pretends tothe pass out on their wedding night
. the next morning
, she feigns illness
, sending a very horny dean off tothe the office
, where he ends up in hte arms of his new secretary
. just as the two are about tothe get overtly physical
, max bursts into the room
and catches them
. the
" horrified
" bride dissolves teh union
, garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way
. of course
, the secratary ws really her daughter page
( hewitt
)
and the whole thing was a set
- up
. the women move on
,
but an irs agent
( bancroft
) catchs up with them
and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes
. in desperate need of funds
, max
and page head forthe palm beach to replay the scam
. their mark this time is william b
. tensy
( hackman
, in hideous make
- up
)
, a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking
. max starts to put the game into action
,
but page is so repelled by the old man
(
and angry with her mom
) thast she slips off to inact her own socre
, targeting jack
, a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune
. complications arise when page realizes tath good
- natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart
. as if that wasn ' t enough
, dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind
. the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior
" a fish called wanda
.
" i won ' t bother to compare the two
. suffice to say that everyting done right in
" wanda
" is done wrong here
.
" heartbreakers
" isnt soulless
, inept
and
, at 123 mintues
, at least a half
- hour too long
. sigourney weaver
and jennifer love hewitt throw themselfs into their parts
,
but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters
. gene hackman isnt utterly wasted in a one
- note
, one
- joke part that has him doing nothing
but smoking
, coughing
and waxing rhapsodic about smoking
and sex
. poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role
and the normaly charismatic actor comes off as merely bland
. ray liotta manages tothe squeeze a tiny bit of humanity
and humor inot his walking clich
?
,
but only a bit
. the low point in the film hasnt weaver employing a russina accent bad enough to amke boris
and natasha wince
, while doing half
- assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue
. bear in mind
,
though
, that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing
but low points
. if you remember bob hope specials with fondness
, this might be your cup of tea
. as for me
, i ' m going to watch
" a fish called wanda
" now
and try to foreget i ever saw
" heartbreakers
.
