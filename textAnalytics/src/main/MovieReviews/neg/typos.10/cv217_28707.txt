the swirling sick feeling hitted me just a few minutes into
" heartbreakers
.
" ray liotta
' s character was mkaing outloud with his secretary when his new wife knocked on the door of his office
. while scrambling to collect himself
, he frantically shouted to her
,
" just wait a sex
? er
, i mean sec
!
" i was struck by a wave of revulsion
, thinking
,
" geez
, didn
' t lines like tht die when
' three
' s comapany
' was canceled
?
" over the next few minutes
, as the barely double entendres
and lingering cleavage shots grew more numerous
, i realized that the mindset behind
" heartbreakers
" predated
" three
' s company
.
" suddenly
, i had an out
- of
- body experience as my internal way
- back machine sweept me to the mid
- 1960s
. all across america
, the counter
- culture ws growing like wildfire
,
but there was scant evidence of it on tv
. while young people were challenging traditional values onthe the streets
, frustrated teenagers like me were stuck at hmeo
, sulking while our parents enjoied the latest bob hope special
. women in skimpy bathing suits would prance onscreen while hope made growling noises
and leered at their breasts
. on another channel
, dean martin made wisecracks about
" booze
and broads
"
and peter lawford
, decked out inwhich love beads
and a nehru jacket
, purred suggestive one
- liners as he ogled the go
- go dancers
. teh adults laughed
and laughed
.
" heartbreakers
" reeks of that stagnant mentality
, from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt
' s vah
- vah
- voom breasts to its leaden screenplay
, which paints womens as haughty schemers
and men as drooling buffoons too sex
- obsessed to realize they are being manipulated
. in addition to liotta
and hewitt
, the cast includes sigourney weaver
, gene hackman
, jason lee
, nora dunn
and anne bancroft
. i can
' t imagine what drew performers of theri caliber to this project
. perhaps they
thought it was a parody of hte sniggering sex comedies of the
' 60s
. if so
, they were sadly mistaken
. the story revolves around a mother
- daughter con
- team
. it opens with the marriage of max
( weaver
) to dean
( liotta
)
, a newyorker jersey chop shop operator
. having withheld sex until the honeymoon
, max pretends to pass out on their wedding night
. the next morning
, she feigns illness
, sending a very horny dean off to the office
, where he ends uv in the arms of his new secretary
. just as the two are about tothe git overtly physical
, max bursts into the room
and catches them
. yhe
" horrified
" bride dissolves the union
, garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way
. of course
, teh secretary wass really her daughter page
( hewitt
)
and the whole thing was a set
- up
. the women move on
,
but an irs agent
( bancroft
) catches up with them
and dem
ands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes
. in desperate need of funds
, max
and page head for palm beach to replay tje scam
. their mark this time is william b
. tensy
( hackman
, in hideous make
- up
)
, a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking
. max starts to put the game into acation
,
but page is so repelled by the ood man
(
and angry with her mom
) that she slips off tothe inact her own score
, targeting jack
, a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune
. complications arise when page realizes that good
- natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart
. as if that wasn
' t enough
, dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind
. the attempt tothe weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior
" a fish called w
anda
.
" i won
' t bother to compare the two
. suffice to say that everything done right infact
" w
anda
" is done wrong here
.
" heartbreakers
" is soulless
, inept
and
, at 123 minutes
, at least a half
- hour too long
. sigourney weaver
and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts
,
but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters
. gene hackman is utterly wasted in a one
- onot
, one
- joke part tht hasnt him doing nothing
but smoking
, coughing
and waxing rhapsodic about smoking adn sex
. poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role
and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bl
and
. ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity
and humor inot his walking clich
?
,
but only a bit
. the low point in the film hasnt weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris
and natasha wince
, while doing half
- assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue
. bear in mind
,
though
, that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing
but low points
. if you remember bob hope specials with fondness
, this might be your cup of tea
. as forthe me
, i
' m going to watch
" a fish called w
anda
" now annd try to foreget i ever saw
" heartbreakers
.
