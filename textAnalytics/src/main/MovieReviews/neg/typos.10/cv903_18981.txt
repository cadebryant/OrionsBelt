don
' t let this movie fool you inot believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare
. no one will truely underst
and the heart
and soul of this man except through his work
,
and this movie makes a vain attempt at that
. any moves to
? glamorise
' his life
, which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do
, will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness
. this movie about his life
,
al
though well written
, puts too much make
- up on a man whose life was probably more pork
and potatoes
, rather than lobster
and champagne
. oh well
, let
' s fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play
- write
, who falls in love with a beautiful woman
( gwyneth paltrow
)
and from her inspiration
, several plays develop
-
? romeo
and juliet
'
, adn
? the twelfth night
'
. it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream
and that
' s how all his plays develop
,
but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama
.
but i guess my version probably wouldn
' t draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen
. so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare
, when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul
. i think not
. as fo the oscars were they deserved by this movei
? i think not
. in many spects
? private ryan
' annd
? life is beautiful
' weere far superior movies
,
but one should never asume that this shoudl be a criteria for winning an oscar
, as time
and again
, for reasons unexplained
, an undeserving movie will win the accolade
. another sore point is teh fact that gwyneth won the best female lead
, over a more polished cate
,
but i guess if yuo go on enough about your gr
andfather dying
and your nephew being hospitalised
- people wiull start feeling sorry for you
