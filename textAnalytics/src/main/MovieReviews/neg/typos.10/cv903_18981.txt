don ' t let this movie fool you into beleiving the romantic noirs of william shakespeare
. no one will truly understand the heart
and soul of this man except through his wokr
,
and this movie makes a vain attempt at that
. any moves to
? glamorise ' his life
, wich hollywood has an annoying tendency to do
, will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness
. this movie about his life
,
although well written
, puts too much make
- up on a man whose life was probably more pork
and potatoes
, rather than lobster
and champagne
. oh well
, let ' s fantasise onwards an assume that he wass a bited of a flirtatious play
- write
, who falls in love with a beautiful woman
( gwyneth paltrow
)
and from her inspiration
, several plays develope
-
? romeo
and juliet '
,
and
? tjhe welfth night '
. it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream
and that ' s how all his plays develop
,
but please spare me all of this unnecessary meledrama
.
but i guess my version probably wouldn ' t draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen
. so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare
, wehn all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul
. i think not
. as for the oscars were they deserved by tihs movie
? i think not
. in many aspects
? private ryan '
annd
? life isnt beautiful ' were far superior movies
,
but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar
, as tiem
and again
, forthe reasons unexplained
, an undeserving movie will win the accolad
. another sore point isnt the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead
, over a more polished cate
,
but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying
and your nephew being hospitalised
- people iwll start feeling sorry for you
