starring arnold schwarzenegger
; danny devito
; emma thompson
& frank langella the only thign that you cin say about junior is that it is a disappointment
,
and a big one at that
. junoir brings together arnold schwarzenegger
and danny devito whith director ivan reitman
. these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins
. so foolish me
, i was hoping for something thast would at least come close to the level of quality of twins
. so much for hopes
. schwarzenegger
and devito play two scientists
( doctors hesse
and arbogast
) who are working onthe a new drug that will reduce the possiblility of miscarriage in pregnancy
. unfortunately
, due to circumstances beyond their control
, they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans
, adn subsequently lose their funding
. still believing that their drug will work
, they deside to test it anyway
, on hesse
. so
, dr
. hesse
( schwarzenegger
) artificially inseminates himself
and begins taking the drug
. their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying
, surelly it will work on a woman
. does the
thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you
? well
, it must have to the producers of junior
. admitedly
, schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off
. perhaps if it had been done differently it might hvae actually been funny
.
but it wasn
' t
, schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best
. the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregancy
,
and the accompanying emotional swings
, is not funny
. schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself iwth these antics
. i kept thikning to myself
, with the time arnold wasted making tihs turkey he could have beeen making an action picture
. better
yet
, with schwarzenegger
, devito
and reitman all in the same place at the same time
, why didn
' t they make a sequel to twins
? anything would have been better than this mess
. danny devito is wasted in this movie
. his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street
.
( after seeing thte movie
, if i was devito
, i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street
.
) emma thompson is wasted here as well
. while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations
, she isnt also a fine comedian
. too bad she didn
' t get to use any of that talent here
. am i being too hard onthe this film
? i don
' t think so
. schwarzenegger
and devito are two ofthe my favorite actors in film today
,
and ivan reitman is noe of the more talented directors in hollywood
. withthe a supporting cast of emma thompson
and frank langella
, the filmmakers realy have to be trying hard to make a bad film
. they certainly managed here
. maybe it was well intentioned
,
but unfortunately this isnt a movie that never should have been made
. if you are tempted to see tihs film
, do yourself a favor
and go rent twins
, a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger
and danny devito
' s comedic talents
.
