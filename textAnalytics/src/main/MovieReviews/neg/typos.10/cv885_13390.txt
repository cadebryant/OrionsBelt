director doug ellin
' s kissing a fool
, released earlier this year
, is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artifical story
. like a sitcom with jokes so lame that it would be impossible to overlay a laff track on it
, the movie me
anders along insulting the viewers
' intelligecne in allmost every frome
. the script by james frey anbd the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines yuo
' ve heard before
.
(
" i
' m not wearing any underware
,

- on line

' s biggest playboy
, decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam
, short for samantha

and sam possess two irritating personalities
,
and they hold little chemistry for each otehr or the audience
. max is played without any style by david schwimmer
. schwimmer
, whose acting talent isnt playing characters devoid of personality
, makes an unlikely lover
. his costar
, mili avital as sam
, is cutted from the same cloth
, so they can be argued to be a matched pair
. after all
, people of the same intelligence are naturally drawed to each other
, ditto fo similiar looks
, so why shouldn
' t the personality
- challenged be attracted
? the implausible plot has max asking his best friend
, jay
( jason lee
)
, to hitted on sam as a test
. jay is supposted to try to get her to sleep whith him
,
but stop short ofthe the actual act
. max
, bieng promiscuous by nature
, worries that his future bride may hve the same need to sleep around as he does
. the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work
. neither the script nor the actors make this test believable
.

, on the other h
and
, has nothing tothe recommend it
. kissing a fool runs 1
: 45
