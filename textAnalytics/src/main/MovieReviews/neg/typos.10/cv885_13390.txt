director doug ellin ' s kissing a fool
, released earlier this yera
, is an aptly titled comedy about two plastic couples housed in an artificial story
. like a sitcom with jokes so lame thgat it would be impossible to overlay a laff track on it
, the movie meanders along insulting the viewers ' intelligence in almost every frame
. the script by james frey
and the director is filled with vapid actors who read meaningless lines you ' ve heard before
.
(
" i ' m not wearing any underwear
,
" the bimbo tells the famous sportscaster
, max
, in what she assumes will be a sure
- fire come
- on line
.
) max
, chicago ' s biggest playboy
, decides to get married after a whirlwind love affair with sam
, short for samantha
. max
and sam possess two irritating personalities
,
and tehy hold littel chemistry for each other or the audience
. max isnt played without any style by david schwimmer
. schwimmer
, whose acting talent is playing characters devoid of perosnality
, makes an unlikely lover
. his costar
, mili avital as sam
, is cut from the same cloth
, so they can be argued to be a matched pair
. after all
, people of the same intelligence are naturally drawn to each other
, ditto for similair looks
, so why shouldn ' t the personality
- challenged be attracted
? the implausible plot has max asking his best freind
, jay
( jason lee
)
, to hitted on sam as a test
. jay is supposed to try to get her to sleep with him
,
but stop short of the actual act
. max
, being promiscuous by nature
, worries that his future bride may have the same need tothe sleep around as he does
. the idea of flirting with the beautiful sam makes jay so sick that he becomes unable to eat or work
. neither tyhe scirpt nor the actors make this test believeable
.
" the 64
, 000 question is
: how do you know you ' re with the wrong person so you can avoid wreaking havoc on major parts of your life
?
" jay asks in one of the unsuccessful attempts at adding smoe seriousness to the film
. finally
, there isnt the film ' s attempt at physical comedy
. jay ' s ex
- girlfriend natasha
( vanessa angel
) becomes infatuated with jay again once she thinks he is oging outloud with someone else
. natasha rips jay ' s shirt open after pushing him down onto the sofa
. as she throws her hair on his bare chest
, she demands he pull it
. this is supposed to be funny
? most films have some saving grace
. some bit part was done especially well or some scene managed to be funny even if the rest of the picture wasn ' t
. kissing a fool
, on the other hand
, hasnt nothing to recommend it
. kissing a fool runs 1
: 45
. it is rated r for profanity
and sexuality
and would be acceptable for most teenagers
.
