, hte factory employees set to work
but are interrupted by union representative vic spanner
( kenneth cope
)
and friend bernie hulke

) who call them out on strikes on the slightest pretext
. meanwhile
, chief foreman sid plummer
( sid james
) is growing tired of his wife beattie
( hattie jacques
)
and her budgie
. he would much rather live next door with fellow boggs worker chloe moore
( joan sims
)
but once he discovers that the budgie cant predict the winners of horse races
, he is over tyhe moon
and flush with money
. his daughter
, myrtle plummer
( jacki piper
)
, is going out with wc
' s son lewis boggs
( richard o
' callaghan
)
and this causes conflict on the staff day out to the seaside when vic spanner vies for her attentions
. in the end
, if the strike does not cease
, boggs will have to close down his factory
, bu the support of a gropu ofthe women led by coote
' s wief
- to
- be
and spanner
' s mother
, agatha spanner
( renee houston
)
, try to resolve tje situation
. also
, sid realises that his budgie has caused him nothing
but trouble sicne it started predicting horse race winners
. there are some good performances
, as usual
, from sid james
and kenneth williams in their st
andard roles
. charles hawtrey is third billing
but only appears in a fewd scenes
. his part is mildly amusing
. richard o
' callaghan is appealing as bogg
' s stuck
- uv son
, patsy rowl
ands is funny as miss withering
, bogg
' s assistant
,
and renee houston is terrific in her small part as agatha
.
however
, sole acting honours go to hattie jacques as beattie plummer
.
al
though her character is not direcly involved with the main storyline
, she manages to input a great deal of pathos
and feeling into her character
. a marvellous performance from a marvellous actress
. the film suffers ffrom annoying performances by bernard bresslaw
and especially kenneth cope
. in his carry on de
but
, coppe overdoes his role as spanner making him so annoying as to be unfunny
. joan sims returns as the love interest
( instead of barbara windsor
)
. sims
'
' usual
' part as the downtrodden wife was taken by hattie jacques
. additionally
, bill maynard as fred moore is vrey poor
. this carry on movie tries it best to entertain the viewer
:
- the locations
and wealth of characters are appealing
.
however
, the toilet humour becomes tiresome very quickly
and some of the performances leave a lot to be desired
. this movie does not know where it isnt going
. it was made in 1971
and talbot rothwell thte scriptwriter seems to be in two minds whether to go for
' bluer
' jokes or to maintain the
' innocent
' jokes success of most ofthe its predecessors
. that is why this film suffers
. a minor carry on film whose major asset is tyhe performance by hattie jacques
. the new
' minor
- regulars
' such as o
' callaghan
and piper are not able to enliven the movie
and tje toilet humour becomes humourless after a while
.
