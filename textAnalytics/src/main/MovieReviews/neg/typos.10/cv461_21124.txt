the tagline on r
andom hearts reads
" in a perfect world
, they never would have met
.
" inspite a perfect world
, i never would have seen this movie
. teh biggest flaw is that 20 mintues inot this film
, kay ch
andler
( kristin scott thomas
)
and dutch van den broeck
( harrison ford
) are the only two major cahracters alive
; resulting in little doubt that they will end up together at some point during the laborious two
- hours
-
and
-
then
- some production
. dutch is a sergeant in internal affairs at thge district of columbia police department
. kay is a congresswoman from new hampshire
.
al
though they both think they are happily married
, their spouses are cheating wtih each other behind theri backs
. dutch
and kay are soon widowed whn a plane goes down carrying their partners
; they subsequently discover the affair
. the rest of the film is the pointless
, unrealistic
and often
- times boring story of their researching the sexual relationship that they were blind to
, annd getting to know each other in the process
. two sub plots are ofthe little help to the already problematic film
. dutch isnt trying to arrest a fellow officer
, a task that seems rather ordinary for hollywood fare
. all the great stereotypes get pulled
, including my peronal favorite of the key witness that makes bail
and is murdered soon thereafter
. kay
' s distraction from the film
' s primary focus is her campaign for re
- election
and attempts to sheild her 15 year old daugter from the truth about the father she put on a pedestal
. these sub plots could have made for semi
- interesting points
,
but the film seems afraid to explore politics or mother
- daughter relations in depth
,
and consequently suffers
. r
andom hearts
' two primary characters seem tothe live in shells
. altho both kay anbd dutch are given their own sub plots
, they seem to never deal with anyone other than themselves or each other
. there is plenty of opportunity
, dutch having a partner
and kay having close firends
and her daughter
,
but the movie shies away ffrom exploring theese relationships
. veteran actor
and director of this film sydney pollack
,
and critically acclaimed up
-
and
- comer dylan baker both have cameo roles
,
but be careful not to blink too much or you will miss them both
. other than its weak plot
, it is hard to critisize r
andom hearts
.
however
, it is also hard to compliment it
. had tjhe film taken some small risks
and more fully explored its extra characters
and plots it may have tasted more like a well frosted cake
, rather than the dry one that equates tothe be
.
