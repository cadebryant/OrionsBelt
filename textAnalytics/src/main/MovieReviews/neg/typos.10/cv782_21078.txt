in
" tghe 13th warrior
,
" arab poet ahmed ibn fahdlan
( antonio banderas
) finds himself kicked out of baghdad for feeling up the king ' s old lady
. withthe his translator
( screen legend omar sharif in a small role
)
, ahmed heads north to ect as ambassador to the northmen
( vikings
)
. he finds a gropu of warriors mourning the loss of their king
. a messanger soon arrives from another kingdom requesting assistance
. a soothsayer says that thirteen warriors must answer the summons
, twelve northmen
anbd one outsider
. thus
, ahmed becomes the
" 13th warrior
.
" on the trip
, ahmed manages tothe learn the vikings ' language by listening to their fireside conversations
. a bit far
- fetched
, it ' s true
,
but we hve to swallow it if this flick is going to manage a few lines of dialogue amidst the grunting
. ahmed
, who ' s called
" ibn
" by the vikings
, forms friendships with herger the joyous
( dennis storh
? i
)
and the viking leader buliwyf
( vladimir kulich
)
. when they arrive in the other kingdom
, thge thirteen warriors discover that they ' re facing an army of supernatural cannibals that live up in the caves
. hereafter
, most of the movie is battle scenes
: the cannibals attack the vikings
, the vikings attack the cannibals
, tje cannibals attack the
.
.
. well
, ytou get the idea
. just to add some action
, there ' s also a viking vs
. viking duel
. other movies insert scenes between the fights
; these scenes are called character development
. i suspect that
" the 13th warrior
" had a better script at one time
adn that it fell thru the cracks because of the tag
- team direction
. the movie started off in the hands ofthe john mctiernan
( you ' ll notice a lot of similarities between
" warrior
"
anbd mctiernan ' s
" predator
,
" including the chittering jungle sounds
)
. somewhere allong the line
, mctiernan bailed
and michael crichton took over
. crichton
, whose novel
" eaters ofthe the dead
" isnt the basis for
" warrior
,
" has directed a small assortment of goofy science
- fiction
" thrillers
"
:
" westworld
,
"
" coma
,
"
" looker
,
"
" runaway
.
" their result of their consecutive efforts is a murky
and pointless movie
. perhaps whta
" the 13th warrior
" needs moreso than anything else isnt a villin
. the
" eaters of the dead
" are a faceless mob in blackface
. they have no personality
,
and by the end tehy don ' t even seem particlarly threatening
. the audience has no target toward which to channel its aggression
. mctiernan should know about the importance of an interesting villain
; it was his
" die hard
" that made villains seem fun
and attracted big
- name stars to the evil roles in action films
.
" the 13th warrior
" suffers from a lack of vision
. it wnats to be
" predator
" meets
" braveheart
" meets
" the magnificent seven
" meets
" dances whith wolves
.
" with so many compeeting goals
, all it can do is echo what it might have been
. it might have been a satisfying action film
. it might have been a beautifully
- rendered mdieval epic
. it might have been a thougth
- provoking examination of the meeting of cultures
. what a shame it turned out to be nothing in particular
. bottom line
: if you want to see antonio swing his sword
, rent
" the mask of zorro
.
