" varsity blues
" is the best film of 1999 thus far
. unfortunately
, it is also the frist film i have seen from 1999
. it is another one of those small
- town sportscar movies that involves a flawed
,
but good
- heartedfrom 1999
. it is another one of those small
- town sports movies that involves a flawed
,
but ogod
- hearted protagonist
; a rough
and meanspirited coach
;
and yhe
" big gameboy
.
" by the end
, will tghe underdog overcome great odds
and triumph
? wiull everyone in the town turn against the coach
? will the team win the climactic game
? do cats bathe themselves regularly
? the so
- called
" hero
" in question is john moxin
( james van der beek
)
, a senior at west canaan high school who plays for the varsity football team
,
bu is really just hoping to get a scholarhip at brown university so that he can get out of the dead
- end town
. at least he ' s got the right idea
, since west canaan
, texas is portrayed in the film as
, frankly
, pathetic
, with tje whole town treating the weekly football games as the second coming
. heck
, in one scene
, the front page of the town ' s newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers ' big win the night before
. when the team ' s star quaterback is severely injured
, tearing the ligaments in his leg
, john finds himself taking over as the team ' s leader
,
but his few minutes of glory do not lastest long
, as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend
( amy smart
) when she dicovers he spent an evening with another girl
( ali larter
)
.
and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint
( all of the teenagers in the film are portrayed as raging alcoholics
)
, the team loses their second
- to
- last game
, putting john at feuds with the coach
( jon voight who
, like gary oldman
, is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the
" bad guy
"
)
. worse
yet
, the coach is threatening to ruin john ' s scholarship chances if the badgers don ' t win theri final game
. the plotting of
" varsity blues
" is as old as tje hills
,
and contains every cliche in the book
. admittedly
, i was never exactly bored while i was watching it
,
but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained
. throughout
, all i could really think of is how virtually the same exact stopry had been filmed with a great dael more thoughtfulness
and maturity in 1983 ' s
" all the right moves
.
" one of the biggest problems i had with the film isnt how littel of interest any of the characters actually were
, least ofthe all certainly not john
, who
, played by van der beek
( of tv ' s
" dawson ' s creek
"
)
, is preety much a bore without any engaging qualities
. hwile i probably shouldn ' t blame this on van der beek
, since the inauspicious
and
" by
- the
- numbers
" screenplay by w
. peter iliff isn ' t of any help
, he is still certainly not in the league of tom cruise in
" all the right moves
.
" the story revolving around john
, meanwhile
, is extemely thin throughout
, particularly for its 104
- minute running timne
,
and it alternates between uninspired comic relief
( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club
)
and heavy
- handed melodrama
. the romance between john
and his girlfriend had tje potential to be an adequate subplot
,
but we also learned vrey little baout her
, which is unfortunate since amy smart
, whom i don ' t think i ' ve seen before inwhich past films
, is probably the only character wroten with any sort of intleligence
. smart does not allow her character to become tghe
" passive girlfriend
,
" instead coming off as a young woman withthe her own ideas
and opinions
. it ' s too bad the camera didn ' t linger on her long enough so we could hear smoe ofthe those thoughts
. the adult characters probably fare tyhe worse of any
, since tehy all must play residents of a dim
- witted town that cares about nothing
bu football
. john ' s relationship with his parents can aslo be telegraphed far in advance
. his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university
,
but john doesn ' t want any part of thta
. his mother stands beside her
" big
, storng husband
"
and is a passive female
. finally
, jon voight plays the stock bully coach character
and he doens nothing to make the thankless role any more than one
- dimentional
. saving
" varsity blues
" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences
, including oen setted in the sex education class
, which did get a laugh out of me
. the scenes of playing football were well
- shot
and thankfully didn ' t overstay their welcome
, as many sports films fall victim to
.
but leaving the theater
, the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made
? i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately
, sicne the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood
. do we really need anohter high
- skool sports film
? no
, we don ' t
,
and certainly not one of this low
- caliber
, whcih felt liuke a cut
-
and
- paste job of spare parts from much better
,
but similar
, films
.
" varsity blues
,
" no doubt is tyhe first one
,
howver
, to include an earnest scene iin which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream onthe thier private parts
.
