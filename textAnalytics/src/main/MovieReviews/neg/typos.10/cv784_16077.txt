" varisty blues
" is the best film of 1999 thus far
. unfortunately
, it isnt aslo the first film i have seen from 1999
. it is anyother one of those small
- town sports movies that involves a flawed
,
but good
- heartedfrom 1999
. it is another one of those small
- twon sports movies tht involves a flawed
,
but good
- hearted protagonist
; a rough
and meanspirited coach
;
and the
" big game
.
" by the end
, will the underdog overcome gerat odds
and triumph
? will everyone in the town turn against the coach
? will the team win the climactic game
? do cats bathe themselves regularly
? the so
- called
" hero
" in question isnt john moxin
( james van der beek
)
, a senior at west canaan high school who plays fo the varsity football team
,
but isnt realy just hoping to get a scholarship at brown university so tht he can get out of thte dead
- end town
. at least he
' s got the right idea
, since west canaan
, texas is potrayed in the film as
, frankly
, pathetic
, with the wohle town treating the weekly football games as the second comming
. heck
, in oen scene
, tghe front page of teh twon
' s newspaper is proclaiming about the west canaan badgers
' big win the night before
. when the team
' s star quarterback is severley injured
, tearing the ligaments in his leg
, john finds himself taking over as the team
' s leader
,
but his few minutes of glory do not last long
, as he begins to have problems with his girlfriend
( amy smart
) when she dicovers he spent an evening with another girl
( ali larter
)
.
and after staying out all night with his drinking buddies at a strip joint
( all of the teenagers in the film are potrayed as raging alcoholics
)
, the team loses their second
- to
- last game
, putting john at feuds with the coach
( jon voight who
, like gary oldman
, is overstaying his welcome in the typecasted role as the
" bad guy
"
)
. worse
yet
, the coach is threatning to ruin john
' s scholarship chances if thge badgers don
' t win their final gmae
. the plotting of
" varsity blues
" isnt as old as the hills
,
and countains every cliche in the book
. admittedly
, i was never exactly borde while i was watching it
,
but i hasten to add that i was rarely ever entertained
. throughout
, all i could realyl think of is how virtually the same exact story had been filmed with a great deal more
thoughtfulness anbd maturity in 1983
' s
" all the right moves
.
" one of the biggest problems i had with the film is how little of interst any of the characters atcually were
, least of all certainly nto john
, who
, palyed by van der beek
( of tv
' s
" dawson
' s creek
"
)
, is pretty much a bore without any engaging qualities
. while i probably shouldn
' t blame this on van der beek
, since the inauspicious
and
" by
- teh
- numbers
" screenplay by w
. peter iliff isn
' t of any help
, he is still certainly nto in the league of tom cruise infront
" all the right moves
.
" the story revolving around john
, meanwhile
, is extemely thin throughout
, particularly for its 104
- minute running time
,
and it alternates between uninspired comic relief
( as in when the students see theri sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club
)
and hevy
- h
anded melodrama
. thge romance between john
and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot
,
but we aslo learned very little about her
, which is unfortunate since amy smart
, whom i don
' t think i
' ve seen before in past films
, is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence
. smart doesnt not allow her character to become tyhe
" passive girlfriend
,
" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas
and opinions
. it
' s too bad the camera didn
' t linger on her long enough so we coudl hear some of thsoe
thoughts
. the adult characters probably fare the worse ofthe any
, since they all must play residents of a dim
- witted town that cares about nothing
but football
. john
' s relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance
. his father is set onthe him becomming a footall player at a university
,
but john doesn
' t wanna any part of that
. his mother st
ands beside her
" big
, strong husban
"
and is a passive female
. finally
, jon voight plays the stock bully coach character
and he doesnt nothing to make the thankless role any moreso than one
- dimentional
. saving
" varsity blues
" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences
, including one set in the sex eduction class
, which did get a laff out ofthe me
. the scenes of playing football were well
- shot
and thankfully didn
' t overstay their welcome
, as many sports films fall victim to
.
but leaving teh theater
, the question i had in my mind was why did this film ened to be made
? i seem to be asking htis question quite a lot lately
, since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood
. do we really need another high
- school sports film
? no
, we don
' t
,
and certainly not one of this low
- caliber
, which felt like a cut
-
and
- paste job of spare parts from much better
, bu similar
, films
.
" varsity blues
,
" no doubt is the frist one
,
however
, to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts
.
