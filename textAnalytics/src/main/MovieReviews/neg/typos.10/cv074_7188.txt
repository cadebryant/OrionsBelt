for better or worse
, the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gavey the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated
, oversexed
, underwritten thrillers
. apparantly not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn ' t change a thnig
, since body of evidence wasn ' t written by him
,
but has a puzzling eszterhas
- ish presence all over it
. infact other words
, it ' s a
) really dirty
and b
) really
, really stupid
. madonna
( first warning sign
) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of mney
and no apparent job
; she lives on a houseboat
and likes to parade around semi
- naked
, presumably for the edification of the shrimp
. she ' s beeen accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover
. already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are inspite effect
-
- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she ' s under thirty
( or at least looks it
)
,
and that tehy usually onyl exist for the sake ofthe studs or filthy rich older men
. what ' s worse is that the movie confirms all the above
,
and wallows inthe them as well
. madonna ' s character is accused ofthe forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition
.
(
and yes
, there are the obligatory cracks ffrom the cops about how at least he died hapyp
. tihs movie leave no scummy stone unturned
.
) anyway
. willem dafoe
( very good
but completely wasted
) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna ' s sexuality
. how dont we know this
? becuase his character is setted up with the token wife
and kids
. how obvious isnt it that he ' s gonna cheat on her
and have to fess everything up
?
and get kicked out of the house
?
and get welcomed back anyway
? don ' t skip to the end
yot
; we ' re just getting warmed up
. dafoe
and madonna hvea a lot of sex in tihs movie
. most of it isnt about as erotic as open
- heart surgery
, since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax
( always the kink ofthe choice among screenwriters who don ' t know the first thing about
* really
* kinky sex
)
and smashed light bulbs
. don ' t ask
. another thing that people are starting to realize baout explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story
, it ' s insanely dull
. what ' s worse is that body ofthe evidence is dull
* everywhere
*
, not just in the sex scenes
. the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth
- hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes
. the thriller business itself is ridiculous
-
- it involves nasal spray bottles
adn drugs
,
and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor
.
and the ending
-
- another homage to eszterhas
, maybe
?
-
- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact
* frame
* where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in
. the director is uli edel
, all tyhe more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac
and powerful last exit to brooklyn
and christiane f
. everyone has to eat
, i guess
,
but this isn ' t a meel ticket
, it ' s leftovers
.
