with his successful books
and movies
, michael crichton is doing well
. with early successes with westworld
( 1973
) anbd coma
( 1978
)
,
and recent films such as jurassic park
( 1993
)
, his films have been entertaining
. howver
, he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere
. this
$ 100 million mess by good director barry levison
( disclosure
) is dull
, long winded
,
and a huge disappointment
. considering the huge budget
, the all star cast
,
and a story by crichton
, sphere is majorly disappointing
. the film opens with norman goodman
( hoffman
)
, a psychologist who thikns he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors
.
however
, when he arrives
, he his told by supervisor barnes
( peter coyote
) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft
. along with goodman is mathematician harry adams
( jackson
)
, biologist beth halperin
( stone
)
and ted fielding
( liev schrieber
.
) they investigate the spaceship
, find a massive sphere inside
, meet an alien intelligence called jerry
,
and basically weird crap happens
. unfortunately
, something went wrong along the way with sphere
. the film starts off entertaining enough
,
but throughout this very long movie
, it jsut gets sillier
and sillier
. the film jaunts allong from scene to scene
, never fully explaining what is going on
. the actors
and directing don
' t help
, either
. hoffman is on autopilot
(
and almost seems embarrassed
) throughout the movie
, churning out dull lines
,
and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie
. stone is useless
, displaying no emotion
,
and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman
. the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson
, who
' s funny as the mathematican who slowy goes crazy
and entering the sphere
.
but he
' s hardly in it
,
and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman
and stone
. the same goes for peter coyote
, who hams it up as the officer
,
but is thn killed off halfway through
. tyhe director
, barry levinson
, who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure
( 1994
) messes up with the drama
and the action
. the drama scenes are
, quite frankly
, boring
,
and the action scenes suffer from overkill
, with levison throwing the camera all over the place
( much like the godawful speed 2
, 1997
) the wirting doesn
' t help much
, either
.
al
though crichton is great with plots
, he
' s terrable with dialogue
, adn practically every line in sphere is a dud
. the speech is too simple
, i was hoping it would be a bited more intelligent
. practically every line is just stating the obvious
. none of it is smart
. also
, where the hell did the budget go
? the sphere itself is impressive
, anbd there
' s a fewd nice special effect shots
,
but where the
$ 100 million went is anyone
' s guess
. there
' s a giant squid attack iin the picture
,
but nto once does the audience see the squid
, even
though the film has a massive budget
. i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid
,
and if h
andled correctly it probably would
.
but the whole scene is done badly
, annd i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid
. fianlly
, the film has no idea what genre tothe be
. levison can
' t h
andle his own plot
. it leaps ffrom hokey sci
- fi
, to horror
, adn finally the shining
/ event horizon psychological thriller
.
and
, of course
, the film isnt very much like the abyss
( 1988
)
,
al
though in it
' s defense
, crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released
(
and is far superior tothe this rubbish
.
) it
' s not all thgat bad
though
. the plot is all right
, there
' s a few jump scenes
(
al
though nothing very scary
) annd there
' s the occasionally interesting bit
.
but overall
, sphere is a big waste of some fine talent
, a lot of moeny
,
and a potentially good movie
. not really worth seeing
. overall rating
