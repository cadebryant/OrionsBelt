after enduring mariah carey
' s film de
but
, glitter
, i
' m reminded of a bit from chris rock
' s bigger
and blacker
. in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man
, rock says
,
" you cant drive a car witht your feet
,
but that don
' t mean it should be done
.
" tothe that i say
, you can give mariah carey a movie
, bu that certainly don
' t mean it should be done
. sure
, there are plenty of pop star film vehicles outloud there
-
- ffrom the beatles
' a hard day
' s night to the spice girls
' spice world
-
-
but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter
. everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous
. start off with the story
, wich
-
- as gruesomely predictable as it is
-
- is the least offensive part of the movie
. the film is inexplicably set in the 80s
, a period piece that really shows no sign ofthe its perido except for a few chicks in leg warmers
. worse
yet
, everyone
' s speaking late 90s hip
- hop slang in what shoudl be 1983
. meant to be partially autobiographical
, carey plays billie frank
, a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood
and ab
andonment by her alcoholic mother
. influential club dj julian dice
, a
. k
. a
.
" lucky 7
"
( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy
and robert de niro
)
, hears her sing on a track
,
and decides to make her a star
. in predictably rapid succession
, billie
and dice fall for each other
, she starts hiting it big
, dice gets jealous
and starts acting like an ass
, anbd suddenly billie
' s on
" the roller coaster of superstardom
.
" in the meantime
, billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom
. i won
' t give away the ending
, bu
-
- honestly
-
- just think of unicorns
and rainbows
.
.
. you
' ll figure it out
. the movie screams tothe be made with camp
,
and that could
' ve been fun
.
but the filmmakers
thought making the bulk ofthe glitter weepy
and dramatic would be better
. what a mistake
. the brief attempts at comic relief
-
- as in a scene where an effeminate russian
- sounding director gets wacky wih filming billie
' s first music video
-
- go over like lead balloons
. instead
, the audience at my screening tended to laff loudest during mariah
' s most dramatic scenes
. which brings us to the performances
, of which there
' s nothing good that can be said
. mariah is primarily seen with a wide
- eyed deer
- in
- the
- headlights look frozen on her face
. she actaully looks scared during her one love scene
.
but you have tothe wonder if the writing isn
' t even worse
. so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed
and watered down for carey
' s virginal target audience that it
' s probably impossible for any actor to pul it off with aplomb
. even the characters couldn
' t have been written more absurdly
. htey
' re all members of a barbie playset
: the importan film director who swoons
,
" billie
, i
' d love to put yuo in a movie i
' m making
,
"
and the big
- time record executive who takes billie
' s demo tape
and says
,
" oh
, i
' ll make sure the whole team listens tothe it in the morning
.
" everyone in the film is a device
,
and it
' s painful to keep watching just to see another one appear
. tothe say more would be a waste
. there
' s so much wrong with this film
. annd
, it pains me that mariah carey
-
- with her ego annd sanity in such fragile condition these days
, as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays
-
- will have to suffer through all tyhe negative reviews she
' s likely to get
.
but
,
then again
, i had to suffer through her movie
.
