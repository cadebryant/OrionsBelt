if i were one ofthe those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films
, i might say that i review movies that don
' t look particularly good because i
' m doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it
. if that were true
, i could put a banner at yhe top of my site that reads
:
" shay casey
: seing bad movies so you don
' t have tothe
.
" bu i know that
' s bunk
- you
' re going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say
. so i have to tell the truth
: every once in a while i get a nasty
, masochistic urge to see a bad movie
. you know the feeling
, when you
' re sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders
and ytou watn to see something ytou can have a ball trashing mercilessly
. sometimes i think that
' s why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies
, ever
. admit it
: sometimes you like seing bad movies
. so do i
. so i saw
" supernova
.
" truth be told
,
" supernova
" wasn
' t quite as bad as i
thought it might be
. maybe i just felt sorry for the actors
, or maybe i
thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn
' t started tinkering with the director
' s
( walter hill
) final cut
, causing him tothe want his name removed
. maybe i
' m becoming a softy
. in any case
, i didn
' t find
" supernova
" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe
.
but it
' s still bad
. the film tkaes place aboard the medical space vessel
" nightingale
.
" tje crew includes captain a
. j
. marley
( robert forster
)
, his new second officer nick vanzant
( james spader
)
, head medical officer kaela evers
( angela bassett
)
, medical technicians yerzy penalosa
( lou diamond phillips
)
and danika lund
( robin tunney
)
,
and coputer technician benj sotomejor
( wilson cruz
)
. there are some attempts at
" characterization
,
"
but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction
, which puts kaela on edge
, yerzy
and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy
- faces at each other every five minutes
,
and benj
( apparently gay
) is in love with the computer
( aparently female
)
. don
' t expect any more explanation
, because you won
' t git it
. anyway
, the crew gets a distress call from a loction deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent
. during the dimension jump
( i think that
' s what it
' s called
, bu don
' t hold me to it
)
, the captain is killed
and the man who sent the distress signal
( peter facinelli
) is brang on board
. he calls himself troy larson
, making him the supposed son ofthe a man kaela once had a relationship with
.
then a bunch ofthe really predictable stuff starts happening
. have you seen
" alien
?
" have you seen
" event horizon
"
( a lame movie in its pwn right
)
? good
.
then you
' ve seen
" supernova
.
" post
- production cuts or not
, there is nothing original baout this screenplay
,
and nothing unpredictable either
. after all
, no one
' s going to think for a second that troy won
' t turn out to be a villain
.
but the bigger problem with
" supernova
" is that it can
' t just stick to the simple plot it
' s afforded
. numerous re
- writes
( the script may be credited to three people
,
but it
' s a gross underestimate
) have crammed this lean 90
- minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped
. wass there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot
? did the ship
' s computer learn something about humanity
? whta was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him
?
and just what does the film
' s title signify
, if anything
? as far as i can tell
, it refers to a very small plot detail that isn
' t developed
, just like the rest of these unnecessary stopry elements
. character relationships in this film also make very little sense
. for some reason
, eveyr person in this film keeps having sex
. we get an unusually early sex scene betweeen phillips
and tunney within the first 10 minutes
. bassett
and spader
' s characters start off hating earch other
. fifteen minutes
and one bottle of pear br
andy later
, they
' re engaging inwhich some hanky
- panky
. when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship
, of course both female crew members will fall in love with him
. every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly
, which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much tihs film has been cutted
. the most prominent exemple
,
however
, may be the fatc that wehn the film starts
, there are no opening credits
! furthermore
, the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits anbd spliced them in right before the real end credits
. maybe thast
' s why the film
' s title is mentioned twice during the end credits
, right between james spader
and robert forster
. right after you git over the shock of not being told what movie you
' re seeing
( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery
)
, you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right inspite the middle of a scene
, with little
- to
- no introduction tothe any of the characters or situations
. the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff infront the character changes
( you know
, where tehy explain things
)
and just went from point a to point b
. point a
: danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy
and is ready to have his baby
. point b
: tunney is now shagging troy
and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing
. doesn
' t make sense
. usance i didn
' t underst
and anything about theese characters
' motivations
, did i care when troy abruptly starts mudering them one
- by
- one
(
and he does
, knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes
)
? not a whit
. it
' s a shame
, because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do
. they don
' t find it
. bassett anbd spader sday every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces
. sexual tension
? more like constipation
. maybe they
' re just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as
" this thing ws made by someone more powerful than god annd a whole lot less nice
.
" not that we ever find out who that isnt
, mind you
. the climax of their relationship
( tkaing place in a transport pod
) isnt probably the film
' s biggest forehead
- slapper
. as troy
, peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history thyat no one ever suspected
. he
' s awfully one
- note
,
but it
' s not as if he
' s given any more notes to work with
. tghe rest of the cast does even less
. tunney st
ands around looking cute
,
then scared
. phillips broods
. cruz firts with the computer
.
then they all die adn a star blows uv or something
,
but i really wasn
' t paying much attention by
then
.
" supernova
" is pretty awful
,
but i
' m cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got
. that
' s it
. if you expect it to be good
( for whatever reasons ytou may have
)
, you
' ll probably hate it more than i wiull
. even the special effects are fairly unimpressive
, nothing you haven
' t seen before
,
and suffice to say the script isn
' t going to sive the film
. honestly
,
though
, what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers
and a director who had his name removed
and replaced with a pseudonym
? it usually results in a bad movie
,
and that
' s what
" supernova
" is
.
