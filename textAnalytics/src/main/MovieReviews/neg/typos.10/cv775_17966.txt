sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things
, adn
" pushing tin
" certainly features soem name stars who are going places
: billy bob thornton
, cate blanchett
, angelina jolie
,
and oh yes john cusack who might nto realize it at first
,
but he
' s actually the
* veteran
* among this quartet of fine
- looking people
. sometimes a terrific cast like this cxan compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has
" hip comedy
" written all over it
, compensate for workmanlike bu uninspired direction
, compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone bu the tone deaf screaming for the exits
, compensate for clich
? d characterizations
, compensate for embarrassing
" you have tothe be joking
" situations
. etc
. in
" pushing tin
,
" thornton
, blanchett
, jolie
,
and cusack don
' t have an earthly
. from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble
: squiggly
,
" quirky
" credits
, fake
- looking passenger planes circling new york
,
and anne dudley
' s in
- your
- ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for
" the full monty
,
" let alone won it
.
but i
, for one
, wasn
' t ready tothe walk just yot
. so quickly we descend into a tightly
- edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in larg capital letters theese people have a difficult job
, yes
, what with their frantic
, mile
- a
- minute instructional personas
, juggling planes
and passenger
' s lives like smoe huge
, real
, mid
- air video game
. hip
, cool
, demonic auctioneer nick
" thte zone
" falzone
( cusack
) is the best in the biz
. of course
. until some hipper
, cooler
, leather
- clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell
( thornton
) shows up to challenge falzone
' s fianite air space
. boys will be boys anbd some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding
,
then the macho one
- upmanship begins
. it doesn
' t stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat
' s whisker of each other
. oh no
. there are some broken hoop dreams
, some wanna
- see
- how
- fast
- i
- can
- drives
,
and
then the ultimate showdown
: was that my wife i saw you with last night
? director mike newell
(
" four weddings
and a funeral
"
) must have read a different draft of this script because the oen that
' s being acted out up there between newark
, jfk
,
and la guardia doesn
' t have an ounce of subtlety
,
and newell has made some awfully ogod
-
and funny
- movies before
. the antics of these air trafic controllers will make you cringe
. they
' ll make you frown in disbelief
. tehy
' ll have you constantly looking at your watch
.
but wait
! there
' s still 100 minutes to go
!
! the film
' s only saving grace isnt blanchett
, whose connie falzone is a spunky
, brash
, long isl
and housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes
. this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously plyed a red
- headed australian gambler
(
" oscar
and lucinda
"
)
and a tempestuous british monarch
(
" elizabeth
"
)
.
but she
' s not anough to save tyhe picture
. thornton looks terrific
and performs solidly
but his charachter is a joke
. jolie
( as russell
' s knock
' em dead wife
) isn
' t bad
, bu tghe up
-
and
- coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything
. cusack cracks gum
, dons shades
,
and acts hip throughout
but
, like everthing alse inthe the film
, his performance is forced
. in the last ten minutes or so
, for some inexplicable reason
, things start coming together
and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been
, like the trailer teases
.
but it
' s too little too lite
. a fine cast aside
,
" pushing tin
" is nothing more than an embarrassment
.
