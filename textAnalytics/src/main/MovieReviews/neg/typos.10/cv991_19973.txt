the king
and i
, a warner brothers animated
, musical feature
, recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king
, with obvious results
. when anna
( mir
anda richardson
)
, a british schoolteacher
, travels to saim to educate the king
' s
( martin vidnovic
) children
, she learns that the king isnt treating his people unfairly
,
and must say something to the greedy ruler
. meanwhile
, the king
' s prime minister
( ian richardson
)
, the stereotypical villain
, plots to overthrow the king
, tkaing the throne
. the lastr
,
and most predictable
, main subplot deals with the king
' s son
( allen d
. hong
)
,
and his love for a servant
, tuptim
( armi arabe
)
, anbd how he conflicts wtih his feelings
,
and the ancient laws of saim
. nto even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrable waste of talent
, as the king
and i
' s problems could fill the blank pages of a journal
. i will only note tjhe major difficulties
, for it would take pages to elaborate on eveyr detail
. the screenplay
, written by arthur rankin
, peter bakalian
, jacqeline feather
, anbd david seidler
, which is based apon the play writen by richard rodgers
and oscar hammerstein
, has some of the worst dialogue written in a film withing recent memory
, as every time teh obnoxious king would shout
,
" etc
, etc
, etc
,
" i would cringe
. literally
. speaking of cringing
- i did quite a bit of tihs during the rether short film
, which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking
. besides hte repetitive dialogue from the king
, on the whole
, the songs seem outloud of palce
,
and unlike the lyrics
, are unmagical
. the sole song wich is used cleverly isnt
" getting to know you
,
" which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors
, whitch they have never been exposed to
. unlike disney animated features
, the king
and i
' s songs don
' t add to the film
,
and are as uneffective as could be
. take tje following scenario as an example
, as the sheer horror of tghe king
and i
' s music is at its worst
. yuo
' re being hunted by a dragon
! whta do you do
!
? sing a happy song
! martin vidnovic voices the king wihtout affort or emotion
- you hear the saying two negatives don
' t make a positive
? believe it
! with the terrible dialogue that tyhe king has
, along with his awful voice track
, the king is completely unbelievable
, only shows mild signs of any personality
,
and the only thing that changes in the king is taht he says
" etc
.
, etc
.
, etc
.
,
" more
and more as tjhe film progresses
. no personality at tyhe beginning of the movie
, none at the end
.
and where does this character
' s personality chanage
? hey
, i
thought anna was supposed to change him
! isn
' t that the whole plot
? the prime minister
' s hideous sidekick
( darrell hammond
) brings his share of cringes as well
- oh no
! another one of his teeth fell out
! hardy
- har
- har
! he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets
,
but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him
. by the way this review is going
, you may think yhe reasoning for my hate for this film is due tothe not liking animated films
- hence why i hate this movei
, because tje king
and i is a disgrace to animation
. animated films
, such as 1994
' s the lion king
and 1998
' s thge prince of egypt
, are among my favorite movies of all time
. the animation team does design their share of well animated settings
, so this makes it easier to tkae my mind off of the annoying king
, until i realize that day
and nigth switch back in fourth within seconds
. i have not read the play
, or seen the oscar winning
, 1956 film adaption
,
but from what i can tell
, the screenplay for the 1999 version completely
butchers the play
, for the king
and i is never magical
, nor interesting
. if it wasn
' t for mir
anda richardson
, who voices anna with feeling
, the king
and i could earn the title
,
" worst movie of the decade
.
" instead
, the king annd i will just go down as amung the year
' s worst
. the bottom line
- avoid this movie at all costs
. not even young children
, the target audience in this film
, will enjoy it
. not the slightest bit
.
