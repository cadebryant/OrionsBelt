the king
and i
, a warner brothers animated
, musical feature
, recycles the clasic story of a woman who challenges the heart ofthe a king
, with obvious results
. when anna
( miranda richardson
)
, a british schoolteacher
, travels to saim to educate the king ' s
( martin vidnovic
) children
, she learns that hte king is treating his people unfairly
,
and must say something to the greedy ruler
. meanwhile
, the king ' s prime minister
( ian richardson
)
, the stereotypical villain
, plots to overthrow the king
, taking the throne
. the lastest
,
and most predictable
, main subplot deals withthe the king ' s son
( allen d
. hong
)
,
and his love for a servent
, tuptim
( armi arabe
)
,
and how he conflicts with his feelings
,
and tje ancient laws of saim
. not even the lone storng character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent
, as the king
and i ' s problems could fill the blank pages of a journal
. i will only note the major difficulties
, for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail
. the screenplay
, written by arthur rankin
, peter bakalian
, jacqeline feather
,
and david seidler
, which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers
and oscar hammerstein
, has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory
, as every time the obnoxious king would shout
,
" etc
, etc
, etc
,
" i woudl cringe
. literally
. speaking of cringing
- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film
, which isnt a classic display of terrible filmmaking
. besides the repetitive dialogue from the king
, on the wohle
, the songs seem out of place
,
and unlike the lyrics
, are unmagical
. the sole song which is used cleverly is
" getting to know you
,
" which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors
, which they have never been exposed to
. unlike disney animated features
, the king
and i ' s songs don ' t add to tghe film
,
and are as uneffective as coudl be
. tkae the following scenario as an example
, as thte sheer horror of the king
and i ' s music is at its worst
. you ' re being hunted by a dragon
! what do you do
!
? sing a happy song
! martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion
- you hear the saying two negatives don ' t make a positive
? believe it
! with the terrible dialogue that the king has
, along wih his awful voice track
, the king is completely unbelievable
, onyl shows mild signs of any personality
,
and the onyl thing that changes in the king is that he says
" etc
.
, etc
.
, etc
.
,
" more
and more as the film progresses
. no personality at the beginning ofthe the movie
, none at the end
.
and where does this character ' s perosnality change
? hey
, i thought anna was supposed to change him
! isn ' t that the whole plot
? the prime minister ' s hideous sidekick
( darrell hammond
) brings his share of cringes as well
- oh noone
! another oen of his teeth fell out
! hardy
- har
- har
! he isnt supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets
,
bu even at age five i would have cringed while watching him
. by the way this review is gonig
, you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films
- hence why i hate tihs movie
, because the king
and i is a disgrace to animation
. animated films
, such as 1994 ' s the lion king
and 1998 ' s the prince of egypt
, are among my favorite movies of all time
. the animation team does design their share of well animated settings
, so this makes it easier to tkae my mind off of the annoying king
, until i realize that day
and night switch back in fourth within seconds
. i have not read the play
, or seen the oscar winning
, 1956 film adaption
,
but from what i can tell
, the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play
, for the king
and i is never magical
, nor interesting
. if it wasn ' t for miranda richardson
, who voices anna with feeling
, the king
annd i sould earn the title
,
" worst movie of the decade
.
" instead
, the king
and i will just go down as among the year ' s worst
. the bottom line
- avoid this movie at all costs
. not even young children
, the target audeince in this film
, will enjoy it
. not the slightest bit
.
