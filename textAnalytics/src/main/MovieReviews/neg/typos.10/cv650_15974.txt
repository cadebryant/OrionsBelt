the scene at the end of 1989
' s
` dead poets society
,
' when robin williams
' english students st
and up on their desk anbd say
,
` captain
, my captain
,
' gets me eveyr time
. unfortunately
, the court room scene near the end of robin
' s newest film
,
` patch adams
,
' doesn
' t have anywhere near the same impact
. from the surfce
` patch adams
' looks very promising
. it
' s a story about a not so young man
, patch adams
( robin williams
)
, who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people
. when the film opens
, we fidn patch
, depressed
and suicidal
, checking himselv into a mental hospital
. in a few scenes
, strongly reminiscent of
` one flew over the cuckoo
' s nest
,
' he ends up helping the patients through their problems
;
and it
' s here that he finds how much he loves working wih people
. so he checks himself out of the hospital
,
and heads straight to medical school
. right from the start
, patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable
. he continuously breaks medical tradition
and makes the dean of the school angry
. shortly after joining medical school
, he meets adn falls in love with carin
( monica potter
)
. they
, along with patch
' s dork friend
, truman
( daniel london
)
, start a medical clinic for uninsured peple
. once tyhe dean catches wind of the clinic
, he tells patch he cin
' t graduate
and kicks him out of school
. patch
, like what any true american would do
, takes the school to court
. it
' s here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place
, over whether or not patch can become a rela doctor
. i have never seen a movie with some potential just completly blow it
. it seems more like a series of short sketches
, rather than a full
- length movie
. considering it runs almost two hours
, much too long for such a glight film
, it could have flowed much smoother
. not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself
,
and manages to cover all the cliches ofthe bad melodrama
. robin williams saves the film from being abysmal wih several comic scenes thgat elevate the movie to intertaining
and worthwhile levels
.
but those moments are rare
and in the end
` patch adams
' is barely average
.
