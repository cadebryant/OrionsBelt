way ofthe the gun is brimming with surprises
, some good
, most bad
. one of the good ones is ryan phillippe ' s surprisingly halfway decent performance
. after the actor gained much attention by posing
and preening through teen swill like i know what you did lastr summer
, he hinted at a bit growth in last year ' s cruel intentions witht his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader peformance
,
though his acting in that film faltered around yhe third act mark
, precisely when tjhe screenplay made his character grow a heart
( presumably to appeal to his traning bra wearing fans
)
and start bellyaching about how he ' d fallen for his
" target
"
. it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film ' s director could negotiate
.
but he seems to be trying
and that shouldn ' t be overlooked
( or probably over praised
) seeing as how
, at this point
, he really isn ' t required tothe do much
but look pretty
. here
, phillippe has procured a five day groth of beard
, his hair askew
and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his
" look here
, see
" glory
. it ' s tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass
,
but his peformance actually helps with the illusion
. unlike ben affleck ' s puppy dog approach in reindeer ganes
, phillippe is believable
and not too bad at that
. as for the plot
, well
, tht ' s one of the bad surprises
; phillippe
and tghe great benicio del torro play two moronic
(
and not even remotely likeable
) criminals
( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people
) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother
( juliette lewis
) after overhearing that she ' s carrying the baby of painter
( scott wilson
)
, a very well connected wealthy man
. the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done
and many are killed
.
but the anti
- heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man
( james caan
)
and two scheming bodyguards
( taye diggs
and nicky katt
) remain in persuit
. directed by christopher mcquarrie
, the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects
, an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles
( thsi one included
)
, way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity
. unlike phillipe
, mcquarrie doesn ' t seem to be growing at all
; he fills his flick wiht a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched ffrom movies i know i ' ve seen before
and worse
, it fiels like it
. the film lacks even a fresh approach
( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey
) to its clich
? s
, all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip
and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is
. it features charactors living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life
. even attempts at emotional weight fiel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan
and benicio del torro stop infact their tracks to hve a cup of coffee
and pontificate on life
, philosophy
, etc
. i didn ' t like thge bit much wehn it first appeared in heat
, here
, it ' s even more self consciously
" dramatic
"
. usual suspects
, which alsot featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies
, worked tothe smoe degree because of that astonishing twist ending
. nowadays an astonishing twist per endig is de rigeur
, never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential
. thus
, nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret
( most amateurishly projected before they apearing
)
and it too has an ironic little twist at the end
( nothing earth shattering
, like in the usual suspects
)
but i admit
, i didn ' t see it coming
,
and i smiled
.
however most ofthe the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri
and spacey in usual suspects
: a lot of faux huffing
and puffing with no rhythm or reason
. or substance
. it ' s just as overplotted as suspects
,
and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters
, a distinctive style
, or a good script would be
. even teh good stuff
, most of whcih involves james caan
( doing a fine job
)
, feels odd
and out of palce in a movie that thinks lines liek
" karma is only justice iwth out the satisfaction
" are clever
. at one point caan laments
" need isnt the ulitmate monkey
" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said
" love is like hippo ass
"
. i ' ve seen porno with better dialogue
.
and some with better plot lines too
.
but rarely has porn offered uv such a talented cast
( i mean
, cxan you even compare james caan tothe ron jeremy
)
. caan slips into this role with seeming ease
, he could do this kind of soft
- spoken tough guy in a coma
,
but he manages to give his character depth
annd weariness
. benicio del torro isnt always welcome
,
though here he plays it fairly straight
( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the acotr gave us in usual suspects
and excess baggage
)
, adopting a brad pitt
- esque quizzical pout tothe go along with his heavy swaggering
. speaking of pitt
, his ex
, juliette lewis
, is a weak link
, either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness
, or waddling about like a silly goose
. nicky katt wass brilliant in a brief role in the limey
, here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted
; he ' s only kept around for his cold presence
. taye diggs has a similar function
, cool as ever
,
but never a charcter
,
though the guy has one helluva death scene
. forthe the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo ' s ass about any thing that transpires usance its characters are never more than simplistic pawns
. it ' s vaguely tarantino
- ish
,
but in a bad truth
and consequences nm way
, with phillippe
, in one scene
, leaping into a stupid rant about
" faggots
" migrating to los angeles
. you know the routine
. tjhe final shoot outloud is pure bargain basement john woo
( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo
) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shooted at
.
but those gun shots sure crack liek thunder
. just the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable
and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt
- like sound that emanated fomr harry ' s fetishized smith
and wesson
. oh how far we ' ve come
.
