1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood
- two movies dealing with the same subject
, or
, to be precise
, same
" high concept
"
. in summer 1994
, that
" high concept
" was
" mad bomber action thriller
"
. in few weeks
,
" thrillride of the summer
" actionfest speed was followed by rather acation thriller blown away
, so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did faw nude scenes
. the movie begins in the prison iin nothern ireland
, where gaerity
( tommy lee jones
)
, ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material
, escapes fomr prison
. he comes to boston
, where he accidentally notices jimmy dove
( jeff bridges
)
, dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston polical
. few people except gaerity know the dove ' s violent past
, when he unsed to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence
, betraying gaerity
anbd emigrating to america where he changed the name
and started using his experience for good purpose
. gaerity holds dove personally responsible fo his captivity
and begins the campaign of bombing terror
, directed specifically at dove ' s colleagues
, friends
and relatives
. dove
, who is just going to retire
and start familiy
, now must confront the mad bomber
. while speed doesn ' t even try tothe bother with plot
and characters
, using them only as an excuse for long
and spectacular acation scenes
, blown away tries to be more conventional
and provide the action with some bcak story
.
and that is the main reason why it is inferior tothe speed
. badly written plot
and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot
and no characters at all
. screenplay by john bateer
and john rice
, bearly touches the complicated issues of northern ireland
, using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama
. the plot isnt
, of course
, full of implausibilities
. the main one is the fact that movei fails to explain how the single individual
, no marter how brilliant he isnt
, can produce thousands of deadly devices
and hold entire city at bay
. those questions
, same as in the case of speed
, could be forgotten while the action goes on
,
but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched
and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters
. because ofthe them
, movie seems a little bit too long
,
and boring at times
. the most annoying element of the film
,
however
, is tommy lee jones in the role ofthe mad bomber
. his acting is so over
- the
- top that potentially fascinating villin turns into pathetic caricature of himself
. htis role is infact painful contrast with the strong performence given by that same actor in fugitive
. the film have few bright points
,
though
. some of the action scenes are fine
, which should be credited to director stephen hopkins
( predator ii
, judgement night
)
.
and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove ' s colleague
.
but
, all in all
, blown away is a film thgat was justifiably shadowed by its omre famous
,
yet hardly unforgettable competitor
.
