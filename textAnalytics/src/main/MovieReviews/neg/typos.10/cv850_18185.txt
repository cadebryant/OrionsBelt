1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood
- two movies dealing with the same subject
, or
, to be precise
, same
" high concept
"
. in summer 1994
, that
" high concept
" was
" mad bomber acation thriller
"
. in few weeks
,
" thrillride of the summer
" actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away
, so disapointing that most ofthe the peopel these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes
. the movei begins in tje prision in nor
then irel
and
, where gaerity
( tommy lee jones
)
, ira terrorist with yhe great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material
, escapes from prison
. he comes to boston
, where he accidentally notices jimmy dove
( jeff bridges
)
, dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police
. few people except gaerity knwo the dove
' s violent past
, whn he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence
, betraying gaerity
and emigrating to america where he changed tghe name adn started using his experience for good purpose
. gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity
and begins the campaign of bombing terror
, directed specifically at dove
' s colleagues
, friends
and relatives
. dove
, who is just going to retire
and start family
, now must confront the mad bomber
. while speed doesn
' t even try to bother with plot
and characters
, useing them only as an excuse for long anbd spectacular acation scenes
, blown away tries to be omre conventional
and provide the action with some back stor
.
and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed
. badly written plot
and badly written characters are somtimes worse than no plot
and no characters at all
. screenplay by john bateer
and john rice
, barely touches hte complicated issues of northern irel
and
, using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama
. thge plot is
, ofthe course
, full of implausibilities
. the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how tyhe single individual
, no matter how brilliant he is
, can produce thous
ands of deadly devices
and hold entire city at bay
. those questions
, same as in the case of speed
, could be forgotten while the action goes on
,
but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched
and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters
. because of them
, movie seems a little bit too long
,
and boring at times
. tghe most annoying element of the film
, howver
, is tommy lee jones in yhe role of mad bomber
. his acting is so over
- the
- top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himselv
. this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive
. the film have few bright points
,
though
. smoe of the action scenes are fine
, which should be credited to director stephen hopkins
( predator ii
, judgement ngiht
)
.
and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove
' s colleague
.
but
, all in all
, blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more faymus
, yot hardly unforgettable competitor
.
