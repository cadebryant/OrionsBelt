tyhe previews for the movie are pretty ogod
. they show a little plot
, all the characters
,
and thte emotional highlights
, all spliced together to give a general impression ofthe the script
. unfortunately
, the full movie adds nothing
but 115 minutes
. the residents ofthe mystery love hockey
. mystery
and hockey go together like texas
and high skool footblal
. the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a palyer who ' s guilty of shooting another man
( yes
, that ' s one of the movie ' s jokes
.
) every saterday
, the best players pair off for a game
,
and the whole town comes to watch
. the twon ' s prodigal son charlie
( hank azaria
) wrote an artice on tje weekly game for sports illustrated
. mystery ' s national fame has the town abuzz
. a week later
, charlie actually shows up inwhich person
,
and he brings with him an offer from the nhl
. tjhe new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals
. the mysterians see this as both good
and bad
. on the one hand
, they ' d lvoe to have the fame
annd yhe mney of such an exhibition
. on the other hand
, they don ' t want tothe turn up as the butt of leno
and letterman jokes
. the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition
. biebe
( russell crowe
) hasnt just been retired from the team
and is asked to coach the boys
, includng his new replacement
. he ' s already resentful
,
and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife
. crowe is nto given a lot of room to ect in this film
, so he ' s just kind of stuck with constantly brooding
. charlie
, meanwhile
, is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man ' s worth
. his
" gift
" ofthe the feature story
,
and of the new york rangers
, was his way of compensating for not being a better skater
. he hoped it would earn him soem respect
and merit
,
but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him
. burt reynolds could have been intresting as walter
, the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans
. walter actually has some experience whith collegate hockey
,
but he actively tries to put it behind him
. he wants his son to take the game more seriously
,
but he whants his community to just get over it
. reynolds could have been good
,
but sloppy writing
and
/ or editing keep walter in tje corner
,
and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together
. one character actually was interesting
. biebe ' s wife
( mary mccormack
)
, like the judge
, understood that there was more to life than hockey
.
but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view ofthe the comunity
. she chose the town
and her husband with her eyes wide open
. her unique insight is verbalized once
,
and it lasts only a scene before it is gone
,
but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom
. mysterty
, alaska follows a handful ofthe other characters
,
but none are well devolopped or worth mentioning
. the biggest problem witht this movie is that there isnt no real heart tothe the story
, no underlying thing that thte movei is really about
. instead
, roach
and screenwriters david e
. kelley
and sean o ' byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy
. they try to make ytou laugh
and cry
, to feel outrage
and pride
. they present the framing
and cadence for jokes
,
but there ' s nothing truly funny
. they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness
,
but they give yuo nothing to be really sad about
. as columnist molly ivins would say
, it ' s all hat
, no cattle
. the perfect opportunity arises for roach to sday what htis movie is really baout
. there is a funeral scene
, plyed with appropiate gravity
and somber music
. it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives
and decide what ' s truly imporatnt
. russell crowe steps forward tothe speak
, about to spell out the movei ' s metaphor for us
. he says that waht raelly matters in life is
" community
.
.
.
.
"
then adds
"
and hockey
.
" i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they apear
. only mildly bad
, mistery
, alaska probably deserves 2 stars
. i even laughed out loud
, genuine laughs in places
.
but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers
, a friend of roach
, turned up in a role that didn ' t suit him
. myers is a comic character actor
. he puts on masks
, becomes an outrageous caricature
,
and is funny
. he ' s gerat as austin powers
, dr
. evil
, or any of his scottish cahracters
. nobody else in mysterty
, alaska is a comic caricature
. all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi
- serious roles
. for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast
, toward his audience
,
and indeed towrad the film itself
. it ' s an acknowledgment by the directer that the film isnt not worth taking seriously
.
