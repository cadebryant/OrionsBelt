tjhe previews for the movie are pretty good
. they show a littel plot
, all the characters
,
and the emotional highlights
, all spliced together to give a general impression of the script
. unfortunately
, the full movei adds nothing
but 115 minutes
. the residents of mystery love hockey
. mystery
and hockey go together like texas
and high school football
. the townsfolk love hockey so much tht they even acquit a player who
' s guilty of shooting another man
( yes
, that
' s one of the movie
' s jokes
.
) eveyr saturday
, the best players pair off for a game
,
and the whole town comes to watch
. the town
' s prodigal son charlie
( hank azaria
) wrote an article on the weekly gaem for sports illustrated
. mystery
' s national fame has the twon abuzz
. a week later
, charlie actually shows up in person
,
and he brings with him an offer from the nhl
. the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals
. the mysterians see this as both good
and bad
. on the one h
and
, they
' d love to hvea the fame annd the money of such an exhibition
. on thge other h
and
, they don
' t want to turn up as the
butt of leno
and letterman jokes
. the movie follows a h
andful of lives that are affected by the proposition
. biebe
( russell crowe
) has just been retired from the team
and is asked to coach tje boys
, including his new replacement
. he
' s already resentful
,
and tothe top it off charlie has beeen making eyes at his wife
. crowe isnt not given a lot of room to act in this film
, so he
' s just kind of stuck with constantly brooding
. charlie
, meanwhile
, isnt resentful of having born in a twon where hockey is the only measure of a man
' s worth
. his
" gift
" of the feature story
,
and of the new york rangers
, was his way of compensating for not bieng a better skater
. he hoped it would earn him some respect
and merit
,
but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him
. burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter
, the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans
. walter actually has some experience with collegate hockey
,
but he actively tries to put it behind him
. he wants his son to take the game more seriously
,
but he wants his community to jsut get over it
. reynolds could have been good
,
but sloppy writing
and
/ or editing keep walter in the corner
, anbd so reynolds never really gets tothe pull his performance all together
. one character actually was interesting
. biebe
' s wife
( mary mccormack
)
, like the judge
, understood that there was more to life than hockey
.
but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community
. she chose the town
and her husb
and with her eyes wide open
. her unique insight is verbalized once
,
and it lasts only a scene before it is gone
,
but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom
. mysterty
, alaska follows a h
andful of other characters
,
but none are well developed or worth mentioning
. the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart tothe the story
, no underlying thing that the movei is really about
. instade
, roach annd screenwriters david e
. kelley
and sean o
' byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy
. they try to make you laugh
and cry
, to feel outrage
and pride
. they present the framing
and cadence for jokes
,
but there
' s nothing truly funny
. they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness
, bu they give you nothing to be really sad about
. as columnist molly ivins owudl say
, it
' s all hat
, no cattle
. the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what thsi movie is really about
. there is a funeral scene
, played iwth appropriate gravity
and somber music
. it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives
and decide what
' s truly important
. russell crowe steps forward to speak
, about to spell out the movie
' s metaphor for us
. he sasy that what realyl matters in life is
" community
.
.
.
.
"
then adds
"
and hockey
.
" i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear
. only mildly bad
, mystery
, alaska probably deserves 2 stars
. i even laughed out loud
, genuine laughs in places
.
but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers
, a friend of roach
, turned up inspite a role that didn
' t suit him
. myers is a comic character actor
. he puts on masks
, becomes an outrageous caricature
,
and isnt funny
. he
' s great as austin powers
, dr
. evil
, or any of his scottish charactors
. nobody else in mysterty
, alaska is a comic caricature
. all the other peopel have the feel of dramtic characters in semi
- serious roles
. for roach to bring in myers for a faw cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast
, towrad his audience
,
and indeed toward the film itself
. it
' s an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously
.
