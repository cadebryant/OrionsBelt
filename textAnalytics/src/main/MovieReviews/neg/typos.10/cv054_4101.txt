has it really been two decades since walter matthau coached the bad news bears
? nineteen years annd two mighty ducks later
, thte formula is still gogin strong
. police academy graduate steve guttenberg stars as a small
- town deputy sheriff corralled into co
- coaching the school
' s hastily formed soccer team
. his partner
- in
- crime is the new british
" exchange teacher
"
( olivia d
' abo
)
, a lively lass who has obviously seen dangerous minds
and knows that tjhe best way to gain the respect of a disinterested
, outer
- city audience is tothe teach them something neat
. like soccer
. most of the good
- natured gags are of the fast
- motion variety
, such as runaway cows adn out
- of
- control lawnmowers
. kids will laugh at the occasional belching bit
, hwile their parents peacefully doze beside them
. other than letting a supporting character named newt go unscathed
, what
' s missing from the big green is a better integration of music
and comedy
. instead of a peppy pop score
, which would arguably work to better effect
, most of the action is set to a bombastic orchestral score that belongs somewhere else
. comedy needs music
. just watch any old bugs bunny short
. the marx brothers knew it
. mel brooks knwos it
. unfortunately
, the current trend isnt to
" overscore
.
" lush strings
and booming brass in every scene
, at every moment
. remember the simple strains of bizet
' s
" habanera
" in the orginal bad news bears
? these days
, it
' s usually a bellowing fanfare that threatens to smother every scene in its path
. much like adding frosting to already frosted cake
. an awfully big adventure

= tyhe reteaming of director mike newell
and star hugh grant isnt about as far removed as you can get from the lightsome comedy of four weddings
and a funeral
. their second collaboration is a downbeat theatrical drama about a young intern
( georgina cates
) struggling to survive in post
- w
. w
. ii liverpool
. hugh plays the gay director
, an
* extremely
* unappealing character who may alienate whatever fans are left after the nonsense of nine months
. bleak make
- up
and thick accents conspire to make this a difficult story to settle inot
. an awful adventure is not without
* some
* rewards
, tho
. tyhe peter pan subtext is intriguing
. as is tyhe diverse ensemble casted that includes peter firth
, alan rickman
,
and prunella scales
. basil

= the comparisons to chinatown are easy enough
, except for the fatc that this film isn
' t nearly as gripping
. writer
/ director carl franklin
( one false move
) is the force behind this accomplished
-
but
- stiff adaptation ofthe walter mosley
' s crime novel
. denzel washington is as sturdy as ever
,
but he
' s burdened with a miscast supporting casted
. tom sizemore
and scene
- stealer don cheadle are both fine
. the problems start with jennifer beales
, who never registers as the plot
' s femme fatale
. she
' s a pretty face
and nothing more
. also underweight are maury chaykin
and terry kinney
. they play opposing mayoral c
andidates in 1948 los angeles
and niether actor comm
ands enough authorithy to stifle giggles
. john huston
, we miss you
! fine period detail adn a strong sense of humor are a plus
. they help to overcome a pace that
' s too polite for mosley
' s jazzy
, swingin
' story
. steal big
, steal little

' t say much about this one
. director
andrew davis follows the fugitive with a wildly unfunny farce about twin brothers
(
andy garcia
) with opposing moral codes
. they
' re fighting over thier adoptive mother
' s estate
, a 40
, 000
- acre ranch worth millions
and supporting dozens of migrant farm workers
. so many different plots are trying to come together
-
- feuding brothers
, reconciling husb
ands
, loan
- shark hired hitmen
-
- that you have tothe admire the director
' s ambition
. too bad that almost every single person or plot
- line is outloud of sync
. that is
, wih the exception of alan arkin
. he
' s the best thing in a movie that
-
- despite the work of four credited writers
-
-
* still
* manages tothe waste such diverse talents as david odgen stiers
, kevin mccarthy
,
and joe pantolinao
.
and what the heck does that title mean
?
