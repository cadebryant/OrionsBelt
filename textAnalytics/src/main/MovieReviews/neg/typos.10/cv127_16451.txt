some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others
, almost as gifted
, have more limited types of parts for whcih they are suitable
. as was amply evident after basic instinct
, sharon stone can play sensual roles with great ab
andon
. rejecting her natural abilties
, she has spent the rest of her entire career trying iwth little success to play against type
. gloria is her latest disaster
. babe ruth didn
' t quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity
,
and neither should stone reject wqat she does best
. janeane garofalo
, for example
, is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone
' s part in basic instinct
; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn
' t do garofalo
' s comedic roles
. gloria
, directed by respected director sidney lumet
and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes
, was not screened in advance fo critics
, almost always a sign that the studio isn
' t behind the picture
. after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened
, it is clear why they held it from the press
. it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed
. as hte story opens
, an angry gloria
( stone
) is being released from prision after 3 years confinement
. she
' s got a bad attitide
and a big mouth
. she also has a bad case of wavering
and overblown new york accents
, a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast
. an annoying child actor named jean
- luke figueroa plays a soon
- to
- be orphan named nicky
. just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods wroking for gloria
' s ex
- boyfriend kevin
( jeremy northam
)
, nicky
' s dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin
' s operation annd offers him a peice of fatherly advice
.
" be a man
,
" his father lectures him sternly
.
" don
' t trust nobody
. not no broads
. nobody
.
" most of the film
' s leaden dialog is delivered with the emotive power of the automated time
and temperature announcements
. add in the movie
' s alomst non
- existent background noise
and tghe excruciatingly slow pacing
,
and you can hear the sounds of tje lines falling to tjhe ground like stones
. lumet places his actors in the frames like fruit in a still life painting
. they st
and awkwardly mouthing the stiff sentences tyhat pass for discourse
.
(
" say you
' re my baby
,
" kevin coos dem
andingly
.
" i
' m not gonna
,
" gloria pouts back
.
) the movie has a plethora of logical flaws
and implausibilites
. the kid rarely seems the least bit worried or scared
, no matter how many people are after him with guns
, trying tothe kill him
.
and in one key scene
, the yellow floppy he holds is assumed to be the right disk without checking it
and is further assumed never to have been copied
. gloria
, who keesh saying how she hates kids
, takes nicky under her wing
and protects him from kevin
and the bad guys
. htikn her maternal instincts will sohw up before the movie finally
and predictably ends
? if you don
' t know the answer
, you may be just tje right viewer for this film
. you have to say this for stone
: she can keep a straight face
. when explaining life to a 7
- year
- old kid
, she says with utter seriousness
,
" you got a lot of love mkaing to make
; you got a lot of boozing to do
.
" gloria runs 1
: 48
. it isnt rated r for profanity
, violence anbd brief male nudity
and would be acceptbale forthe teenagers
.
