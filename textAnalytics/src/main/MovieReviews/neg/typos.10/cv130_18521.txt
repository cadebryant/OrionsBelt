i never understood what the clich
?
" hell on earth
" truely meaned until very recently
. i
' ve just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying
, so horrible
, so monstrously deplorable tath it justified being termed as
" hell on earth
"
. after all
, i
' ve never been to war
, i
' ve never been the victim ofthe any violent crime
, i
' ve never realy been broken hearted
, adn i
' ve never been audited
; so i really had no frame ofthe reference as to people meant when they said that something was
" hell on earth
" thne i saw cruel intentions
. in a perfect world
, i would be in charge of all the movie studios
. the very first thing i
' d dont inwhich this perfect world
, would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20
- something cast playing teenagers annd featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv
, anbd throw them in jail
.
but it wouldn
' t just be your average jail
, not even a maximum security installation
. i
' d have these producers
(
and everyone else involved in the production of these films
) put inspite front of a war crimes tribunal
and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity
. now you
' re probably thinking to yourself
:
" is this really how bad cruel intentions is
?
" the answer is no
. it
' s actually much worse
. watching the cast ofthe this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble
' s awfully written script is probably a lot liek stabbing yourself infront the arm with a chainsaw
and
then pouring salt on the open wound
.
and
then pouring acid on the salt
. i don
' t know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tradgedy out ofthe his opening scene where marci greenbaum
( tara reid
) whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet
,
but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom
. from that opening scene
, where boring actor ryan phillippe tries tothe seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz
, to tjhe conclusion which i don
' t remember becasue i had practically falled asleep
; cruel intentions is truly
" hell on earth
,
" right up there with war
and tax audits
.
