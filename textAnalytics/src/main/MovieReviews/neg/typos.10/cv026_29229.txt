america loves convenience
. after all
, we
' re the culture that invented the cell phone
, tjhe 24
- hour atm
,
and my most beloved
, the remote control
.
yet perhaps this time
, with ghosts of mars
, we have taken our loev of convenience to far
. ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails
, pill
- poppin
'
, martian cop
, sent with her squadron to retrieve
" demolision
" williams
( ice cube
) from a remote mining town for trial back home
. when she
and her comrades
, appropriately dubbed
" the comm
ander
,
"
" the rookies
,
" annd the guy with the cool accent discover the town
' s residents slaughtered
, they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents
' head
- chopping
, alien
- possessed clutches
. filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks
, flashes
- sideways
,
and viewpoint changes
, ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue
and ill
- conceived action sequences
. the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story
. ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movei
, ghosts leaps from one conveinent moment to the next
, stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose
. attempts at character interaction
and development are rare anbd forced
. most of these moments come off as kwik
- e
- mart wisdom
, dispenced heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even
- tempered streetwise h
and of ice cube
. with a gun in oen h
and
and a dynamite cap in tyhe other
, cube reminisces about his street life
, comparing the zombie
- stomping funn to
" me
and my brother when we was kids
.
" apparently
, crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actaully taken to ritually decapitating oen another for entertainment
.
but
, even in the film
' s darkest moments
, fate conveniently lends a h
and
, supplying heavily armored transporation
and easily accessible rifles adn dynamite
. yes
, in the future
, man may travel tothe space
and conquer mars
,
but nothing beats a good stick of tnt
.
and as we all know
, eveyr police station
, past
, present
, or future
, keeps a healthy supply onthe h
and
. characters die
, heads are lopped off
,
but they were only supporting roles anyway
, so why should we care
? as long as you have plenty of narcotics
, immunity is guranteed
. eventually
though
, even tghe most well
- trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity
and needs to be taught a lesson
. what better way thna by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation
, killing anything the machine guns can
' t h
andle
. explosions are fun
.
and even if the nukes don
' t get them
, the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will
. inwhich the end this film defines itself when our cop
' s tribunal pronounces
,
" is that all you have to tell us
?
" for
, indeed
, john carpenter has run outloud ofthe things tothe say
,
and has instead decided to ule whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story
.
