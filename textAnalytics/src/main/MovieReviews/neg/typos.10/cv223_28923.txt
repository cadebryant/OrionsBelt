the first image in
" final fantasy
: the spirits within
" is a computer
- animated close
- up of a human eye
. it
' s a beautiful piece of work
, remarkably detailed
and quite convincing
. when the picture pulls bcak to reveal the owner of the eye
,
however
, things change
. the young woman has mesmerizing hair
,
al
though it hangs too artfully
? even by movie st
andards
? to be believed
. the facial features are more detailed than any computer
- animation seen to date
, bu the result is more reminiscent of a very well
- crafted doll than anything human
. she is preety
, bu bl
and
,
and not nearly expressive enough tothe come off like a person
. all the characters infront
" final fantasy
" are liuke that
. of tje core gropu
, the younger white men
and women are all athletic
, attractive
and indistinct
, like applicants for a tv reality show
. the black man is taller annd burlier
,
and the aging scholar is bald
, with wrinkles
and a beard
. none of them apear to be based on individuals
; they all look liuke the products of general descriptions given a polical sketch artist
. it gets worse when they talk
and move
. why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi
, he of the great twisted face
and snaggleteeth
, coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll
? why
, for every fluid fysical gesture
, do we also see herky
- jerky puppet
- style motions
? more to the point
, who decided a full
- length computer animated movie featuring
" hyperreal
"
( their term
, not mine
) humanoids was a good idea
?
" final fantasy
" is based on a phenomenally popular video game i
' ve never played
, with a story straight out of japanese anime
, which more often than nto leaves me bored
and depressed
. if you
' re a fan ofthe either
, please spare me your letters
, as i will focus solely on the finished film
and not its source materials
. with an expression
- challenged casted
,
" final fantasy
" mixes turgid acation scenes with heaps of mystical shit
. the result is ugly
, confusing
and boring
. note
: the following reveals the basic plot
. if ytou want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie
, i suggest you read it
. earth is at war with aliens that apear tothe feed on human souls
. most of our planet is devastated
, with humans living in a few protected cities
. while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies
, aki ross
( voiced by ming
- na
) adn her mentor
, dr
. sid
( donald sutherl
and
)
, believe in a more organic approach
. tehy operate on the notion
( quoting straight from tjhe press kit
)
" that all life forms have signature spirit waves tath can be identified
and contained
. aki
and dr
. sid collect a series ofthe organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal
and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force
. the waves will
, in effect
, cancel each other out
and disarm the foreign contagen
. they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed tothe complete their wave
. they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out
.
" are you still with me
? there
' s only a little more
. aki is infected with the alien force
. dr
. sid has developed a method of confining the contagion
and keeping it from killing her
, bu hte defense wall won
' t hold much longer
. already
, the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams
. aiding aki
and dr
. sid are the deep eyes
, a group of hard
- as
- nails types that would have falt at home with the troops in
" aliens
.
" capt
. gray edwards
( alec baldwin
) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy
( buscemi
)
, a tough woman
( peri gilpin
)
and a gentle giant
( ving rhames
)
. throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass
: in this case general hein
( james woods
)
, who wnats to use the zeus cannon tothe bomb the aliens back to the stone age
, even if it destroys earth as well
. so there you have it
. like most of the anime i
' ve seen
, the plot combines apocalyptic settings
, lots of shooting
and fuzzy spirituality
, all wrapped up in a savve
- tje
- earth bow
.
but i
' m bored with apocalyptic settings
. i underst
and why so many live
- action films employ them
? they
' re cheap
?
but animated films can show anything
, so why wallow in an indutrial trash heap
? the acation scenes
and shoot
- em
- ups don
' t satisfy either
. the humans move oddly
and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast can
' t bring them to life
( in fact
, their efforts merely emphasize what we
' re missing
)
. aki is especially disappointing
; with her lack of expression
and flat delivery
, she looks
and sound like a brunet version ofthe weena
, tjhe eloi girl from 1960
' s
" the time machine
.
" drab colour choices
and aliens that appear tothe have been created in jell
- o molds sap the pizzazz from the big setted pieces
. students of cmoputer animation may be fascinated whith the technology behind
" final fantasy
: the spirits within
,
"
but i found it sub
- par across the board
.
" futurama
" does more effective battle visuals
, the kids in
" south park
" are far more expressive than these mannequins
and any old episode ofthe the contemporary version of
" the outer limits
" does better doom
and gloom sci
- fi
. so who needs this
? not me
.
