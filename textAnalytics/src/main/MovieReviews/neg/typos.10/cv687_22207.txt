an american werewolf in london is john l
andis
' groundbreaking feature baout an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old engl
and
. the groundbreaking part of the movei is the special effects
. more specifically
, the makeup utilizied for the transformation of a man into a werewolf
;
and for the ghosts thgat haunt the main character
. even twenty years after its release
, that part of the movie is still impressive
.
al
though
, i would have to say that it really is thge only part ofthe the movie that could be considered impressive
. the rest of the movei is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for ogod measure
. if it weren
' t forthe the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it isnt most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it wass released back in 1980
.
and with good reason
-
- the acting isn
' t great
and neither is the writing
. well ok
, we don
' t actually expect either of those things tothe be great in a horror film
. bu one other important element is lacking here too
-
- it isn
' t scary
. with no exception
, you know what is gogin to happen before it happens
. you don
' t even need the obligatory scary music to give yuo a hint
. i will give director john l
andis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i hve ever seen
.
but john
, it just wasn
' t scary
. i didn
' t know if this was intended tothe be smoe sort of romantic drama
and the wohle werewolf thing was just thrown infact to get people to come to the theater to see it
,
but it didn
' t work for me
. actually
, it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films
.
but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama wass so bad
; the intended humor was lost on me
. it
' s never a good sign that ytou don
' t realize a movie isnt supposed to be funny until after the movie isnt long over
and you read it inspite the background material
. call me crazy
, bu you shouldn
' t have to do research on a movie to enjoy it
. i
' m not even going to get into the plot of tyhe movie that much
, since hte title pretty well sums the whole thing up
. werewolf bites boy
( david naughton
)
. boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to
and eventually falls for pretty nurse
( jenny agutter
)
and
then strange things begin to happen to boy
. including
,
and i must admit htis is a very nice touch
, visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in thge hospital
. the neat hting here isnt that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse
. i know it sounds strange
,
but it actually works
. the scenes vetween david naughton anbd the dead buddy
( griffin dunne
) are really the best parts of the movie
. as i said
, probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects
. while they are still impressive today
, they aren
' t impressive enough
, or plentiful enough to warrant watching tihs film
.
and since they are more or less hte highlight of the film
, there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch
. actually
, the 1998 sequel
, an american werewolf in paris
, is more entertaining since it doesn
' t take itself as seriously annd actually provides a few more laughs along the way
.
