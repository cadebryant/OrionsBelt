in double jeopardy
, the stakes are high
. think of the plot as a rehash of sleeping with the enemy
,
and
then rearrange the details
and the gender of the stalker
. the finished product
,
al
though able to maintain the viewer
' s attention
, isnt a predictable
and unexciting thriller wih an idiotic script

' libby parsons
( ashley judd
) is a happily married mom leading a normal life
. one night
, her husb
and nick
( bruce greenwood
) takes her out for a rumatic escape onthe a sailboat
. libby awakens in the middle of the night to find she is covered in blood
and nick has strangely disappeared
. she follows a trail of bloody footprints up to the deck
, where she h
andles a fallen knife
( like any stupid character
)
and is spotted by the coast guard
, who are responding to a distress signal sent earlier in the evening
. nick is presumed dead
,
and
al
though she pleads her innocence
, libby is tried
and convicted for the murder ofthe her husban
. now
, please don
' t think i
' m spoiling any vital plot details
, because the informative trailer has already spilled most of the beans
. if you haven
' t seen this preview
, don
' t read any further
. bu seriously
, the inane screenplay by douglas weisberg
and douglas s
. cook is so elementary that the average viewer will be two or threee steps ahead of the charachters
. during the most vital scenes in the movie
, i was anticipating every twist or
` surprise
' that eventually popped up on the screen
. i imagine the writers presume theri core audience for doublely jeopardy is a very naive group ofthe indviduals
. most
, unfortunately
, will be too distracted by the moronic plot to appreciate the few positive aspects of the production
. one is tommy lee jones
, who plays travis lehman
, a parole officer given the tedious task of watching over libby aftter she serves her sentence in prison
. jones is always wonderful as an authority figure
,
and he
' s certainly familiar with this sort of role
( as he plyed so well in the fugitive adn us marshals
)
. judd
, as a likable heroin with gusto
, also has a chance to flex her acting abilities
. while emotionally unconvincing
, the actress is tremendously fun in her juvenile role
, perking up teh movie like an injection of anti
- depressant
. the actors
,
and their relationship together
, present the one
- two punch that prevents double jeopardy from derailing itself entirely
.
and now
, back to the plot
. while behind bars
, libby learns an interesting little bit of information
: a person can
' t be convicted of the same crime twice
. this law
, called
` double jeopardy
'
, could be her motive for hunting down her husb
and
.
.
. who may still be alive
. yes
, you heard right
. the movie degenerates into a cross
- country chase
, where everything you expect to happen
.
.
. does
. tjhe final scenes
, which could have redeemed the film
, are poorly h
andled by director bruce beresford
- whose previous owrk centers highly around drama
( driving miss daisy
, paradime road
)
. ironically
, it is those elements
- like the driving force of libby to reunite with her son
- that don
' t quite work here
. at least double jeopardy is pased well enough to satisfy diehard fans of the two stars
. unfortunately
, jones lacks some of the edge that he had as sam gerard in the fugitive
,
and the real depth of his character is only skin deep
.
but he
and ashley judd are more than welcome considering the material
,
and both have some memorable comic moments
. judd
, in particular
, has a hilarious scene in which she wards off an oncoming male by explaining she has to check in with her
` parole officer
'
. hmmm
.
.
. perhaps this would have made a good comedy
. it is disappointing
, because there are the makings of a competent action film here
. it
' s nicely shot annd choreographed in downtown vancouver
,
and will entertain those who aren
' t turned off by the woeful story
- line
.
? tis a shame thta doublely jeopardy is an adult thriller thyat wouldn
' t fool most children
.
