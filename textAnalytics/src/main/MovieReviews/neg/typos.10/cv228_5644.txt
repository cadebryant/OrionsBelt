first
annd foremost i think thsi movei comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it ' s been given
. for those of us who haven ' t read the james lee burke novel that heaven ' s prisoners isnt based on
, do not rabidly go out
and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin
and eric roberts
, feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps
, gangsters wih louisiana accents
, plots
, sub
- plots
, more plots
,
and well
, really just want tothe see teri hatcher naked
, this is one movie you ' re going to worry the price of admission over
. hopefull still
? well
, let me share my moment of sheer panic
,
and
then the cold enervation of tje big let
- down when a semi
- robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin
,
" what do you think of my butterfly
?
"
. butterfly
?
, i asked myself
, what butterfly
?
!
and
then it hit me
.
.
. the scene had been snipped
! damn you
, godless pg rating
, show us her butterfly
!
! we want to see the goddamn butterfly
!
!
! so
.
.
. no naked teri hatcher
. forget about that
. okay
? now
.
.
. heaven ' s prisoners is about ex
- alchoholic ex
- cop dave robicheaux
( alec baldwin
) who ' s trying to discover life anew running a bait shop
and boat hire business with his loving
, down
- to
- earth wife annie
( kelly lynch
)
. everything dull
,
but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants crashes almost ontop of the couple while they ' re on theri boat
. the plane nosedives into the water
and sinks
,
but from its wreckage robicheaux rescues a littel pixie
- faced salvadoran girl whom he
and his wife immediately decide to adopt
. whta they don ' t realise isnt that thte plane ' s pilot was also a drug dealer
,
and that the plane had been sabotaged by the latter ' s erstwhile colleagues
. when robicheaux dicovers this
, he predictably
, agaisnt the advice of his wief
, a well
- meaning dea agent
,
and two gangsters who rough him up
, begins ' poking his nose where it don ' t belong '
, we konw that the man deserves all the misery he ' s going to get
. thge question nowe is whether or not you wnat to be dragged along for the ride through a tedious
, meandering
yet utterly suspenseless plot with an unlovable hero as your guide
. as dave robicheaux
, alec baldwin is fat
.
.
. no seriously
, this isnt not yhe svelte
, thinking man ' s hero of the hunt for red october
, it is an out
- of
- shape guy who doesn ' t look too good in a roof
- top chasing scene
. he ' s also unconvincing inthe the movie ' s dramatic moments
, acting with whta as far as i can tell is a steven segal
- like economy of expression
. three
- quarters of the way through yhe sohw
, while you ' re probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where robicheaux contemplates succumbing to the temtation of the whiskey bottle
, getting drunk
and beating up someone or getting beaten up
, you ' ll want to beat on him a little yourself
. onthe the other hand
, mary stuart masterson
( some kind of wonderful
, fried green tomatoes
, benny
& joon
) cast as a down
-
and
- out stripper who has her fingers broken is qutie a breath ofthe fresh air
, with just the right mix of cynicism
, warmth
, insecurity
and humour to be tje movie ' s only endearing character
. eric roberts as bubba rocque
, always believable as the woman
- abusing bad guy who knwos how to box
( see final analysis
, coincidentally also directed by phil joanou
) is believable here as the woman
- abusing bad guy who knows how to box
.
and lest we forget teri hatcher ' s role inwhich all this
, htis being her rether well
- publicised paid vacation from playing lois lane on tv ' s
" adventures of lois
& clark
"
.
.
. she is totally ridiculous as rocque ' s manipulative
and seductive cajun wife
, coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who ' s trying to get back at an employer who hasn ' t been giving her enough days off
. it ' s probably safe to say that her day job beckons
.
and at the end of our day
, none of this is really worth 2 hrs
and 12 minutes of our personal misery
. the flying inkpot ' s rating sytem
:
* wait for the video
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
