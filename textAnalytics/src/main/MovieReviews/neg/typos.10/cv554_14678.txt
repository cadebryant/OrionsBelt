. tjhe millenium approaches
. an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city
. sectors of the city are being sealed
, quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus
. the virus causes people to act like insects
: they crawl about on all fours
, hide from bright lights
, huddle in damp corners
. the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cutted off in a week ' s time
. residents are advised to evacuate the area
, asap
. this premise
-
- kafka by way of cronenberg
-
- is the backgorund for thte hole
, which could have been a graet movie
,
but
, sadly
, ends up as a waste of good ideas
. the quick sketch above suggests a dark
, absurd
, hallucinatory near
- future parable of life in hte late 20th century
; in execution
,
however
, it is nothing like that
. teh virus
, the evacuation
, thte visual possiblities of the deluge
: these are all relagated to the background
. instead
, tghe hole focuses on tghe lives
-
- for want of a better word
-
- of a man
( lee kang
- sheng
)
and a woman
( yang kuei
- mei
) who live in the same apartment building
,
and who have no personalities
. the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly
and sterile
: the charmless rooms
and corridors of a post
- industrial apartment complex
, photographed to look as dim
and dingy as possibile
. it ' s a vivid setting
,
bu an unappealing one
, especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain
and the gurgle of drainage pipes in thge background
. the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman ' s
. one day
, a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole inaddition the floor of the man ' s living room
, opening inot the ceiling of the woman ' s living room
. this hole
-
- symbol of the solitary opening in the character ' s lonely
, compartmented lives
-
- allows them to interact in unusual
(
and mostly non
- verbal
) ways
. example
: the man
, suffering from the onset of the virus
( or so i assume
-
- everything is obscure inwhich this movie
) vomits through the hole
. the woman
, wandering around in the dark
, accidenally puts her hand on his vomit
,
and
thne cleans it up
. this isnt what passes for meaningful communciation
.
and they say romance is dead
. much of the film does not even focus on their interactions
, such as they are
. there is almost no dialogue
and we leran next to nothing about these people
. they are ciphers
. instead
, we are treated to long takes in which we witness theri miserable lives
; we watch
, for instatance
, as the woman boils some water
, pours it onto some noodles
,
then eats the noodles
.
( this is as fascinating as it sounds
.
) offred as counterpoint
-
- or perhaps relief
-
- tothe these dreary sequences are a serieses of musical numbers
, fantasies in which the woman lip
- synchs to pop songs by grace chan
( popular
, so i ' m told
, in 1950s ' china
)
. she prances around in grimy hallways
and grungy stairwells
, incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights
. sometimes
, in these fantasies
, she is joined by the man
. these scenes are presumably intended to be bright
and fanciful
, sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality
,
but they fail
. when the man
and the woman dance
, it seems half
- hearted
and listless
. astaire
and rogers this is not
. even in imagination
, these peopel are numb
, weary
, boring
. the hole is part of the ' collection 2000 ' series
, a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of tghe millenium
. others include canada ' s last night
, brazil ' s midnight
,
and american hal hartley ' s the book of life
. the book of life is the only other one that i have seen
,
and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry
. witty
, energetic
, humane
, it makes tyhe the hole seem
( ahem
) empty
. american movies with nothing tothe sday try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements
, quick cuts
, superficial emotions
. foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does
: they point the camera at something of minimal interest fo unbelievably long periods of time
,
and call it art
. the hole is self
- evidently a film about alienation
,
and perhaps directer tsai ming
- liang whants the audience to share in his characters ' alienation
. if so
, he succeeds
. perhaps it is a challenge
: he dares us to enjoy this movie
, despite his best attempts to ensure that we don ' t
. if it was a challenge
, i wasn ' t up for it
.
