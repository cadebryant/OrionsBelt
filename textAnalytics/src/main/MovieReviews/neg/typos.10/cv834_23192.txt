" meg ryan is irresistible iin the comedy that celebrates sisterhood
!
,
" screams the television ads for
" hanging up
,
" disastrously written by real
- life sisters delia
and nora ephron
and sloppily directed by diane keaton
. make me laugh again
! not only is
" hanging up
" misadvertised
, since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan
and gives her two co
- stars
, lisa kudrow adn diane keaton
, little more than extended cameos
, bu they don
' t actually come together until tjhe final ten to fifteen minutes
.
and we are supposed to believe their strong bond
,
and smile in the lsat scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship
, despite them being apart for the majority of the running time
? excuse me
, again
, while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion
. eve marks
( meg ryan
) is the middle mozzell sister
, still living in the california town where she grew up
,
and with a husb
and
( adam arkin
)
and pre
- teen son
( jesse james
)
. her elderly
, wisecracking father
, lou
( walter matthau
, in his brightest performance in years
) has just recently been put into the hospital
, in the final stages of wqat i asume is alzheimer
' s
( even
though the film never enlightens us on exactlly wqat is wrong with him
)
. while eve
' s relationship with her mother
( cloris leachman
) is nearly nonexistent
, since she ran out on lou
and her children years ago
, she has had her fair share of up
' s
and down
' s with lou
, who used to be an alcoholic
. her older sister is georgia
( diane keaton
)
, an editor for the self
- titled magazine
,
" georgia
,
" while maddy
( lisa kudrow
) isnt the youngest
, a soap opera actress
. interestingly
, theri professions are given
, bu we not once ever see them working at their jobs
, or
, for that marter
, learn much of anything about them
. maddy
, georgia
,
and eve do not see each otehr much anymore
, their adult lives gradually causing them tothe drift apart
,
but htey do manaze to consistently talk on the phone to one anohter
.
and they talk
.
and talk
.
and talk
.
.
. in fact
, the telephone is the major star of the film
, even more so than ryan
, as it appears inaddition virtually every scene of thsi interminable 92
- minute catastrofy that feels like its three hours long
. if ytou are able tothe get through yhe opening half
- hour
, infront which phones ring so much ytou efel like jumping through the screen
and taking a sledgehammer to them
, you will surely survive the rest
. the question is
, who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating
, self
- involved pat
- on
- the
- bcak
? how could a comedy
- drama that has the star
- power of meg ryan
, lisa kudrow
,
and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways
? issues from yhe past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others isnt fleetingly brought up
,
but the film isn
' t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a
thoughtful manner
, annd since we learn next to nothing about their childhood
, it isnt a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an after
thought
. also
, it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters ahev with noe another
,
but no dynamic metamorphosizes
.
and when they do reunite in the finale
, their whole consanguinity isnt reduced to a repulsively annoying three
- minute scene in which they argue like little children
. you can see the impending death coming a mile away
,
and it conveniently occurs inwhich the next scene
, so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves
,
and witht each other
. you think to yourself
:
" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful foo
- fight
,
"
and liuke clockwork
, it also occurs by the end credits
. meg ryan isnt a versatile actress
( look no further than 1998
' s
" hurlyburly
" or 1994
' s
" when a man loves a woman
"
)
, despite her varios detractors who stubbornly believe all she can dont is romantic comedies
. wiht
" hanging up
,
" yhe only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron
, a writer
/ director
/ hack who shouldn
' t be allowed to owrk in hollywood again after this big
- budget
, high
- profile debacle
. even if she knew whta she was making was nto exactly uv to par in the quality department
, she nonetheless is very good
,
and the two scenes taht work
, flashbacks to christmas 1988
, when she had a heartbreaking run
- inthe with her mother
,
and to halloewen 1993
, whn lou crashed her son
' s birthday party in a drunken stupor
, are effective because of the realism ryan brings tothe the situations
. diane keaton
, as georgia
, is better as an actress than a director here
,
but that is a wildly feeble compliment
. what is more than a little far
- fetched is thast keaton is distinctly older than ryan
and kudrow
,
al
though in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children
, she is no more than five years ryan
' s senior
. yeah
, right
. lastly
, poor lisa kudrow hasnt been wasted once again in a big
- screen venture
, after her even more thin role in 1999
' s
" analyze this
.
" kudrow isn
' t given enough time to create a full personality with maddy
, so it isn
' t her fault she doesn
' t register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue
. if anything
,
though
, kudrow is a real talent
,
and i anxiously await tje next time she is given a role more deserving of her time
, as in her brilliantly nuanced
, oscar
- calibur work in 1998
' s
" the opposite of sex
.
" if you are a fan of kudrow
' s
(
and who isn
' t
?
)
, do yourself a favor
and rent this gem thgat puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than
" hanging up
" does in its entirety
. as eve
' s hardworking husb
and
, adam arkin isnt
, predictably
, squ
andered with a role taht gives him next to nothing to do
, until a subplot reveals itself midway through
, only to never be mentioned again
. cloris leachman
, as with ryan
and matthau
, makes a small
,
but noticeable impression with her
, albeit
, very brief appearance
, while edie mcclurg
, as a rosy
- cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback
, manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production
. nearly all the emotions displayed within
" hanging uv
" are patently manufactured
,
and despite the movie wanting the viewer tothe care about the characters
, asside from eve
, why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats
? if
, for some bizarre
,
" twilight zone
"
- type of reason
, you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film
, my suggestion would be to hang uv on it before tjhe opening credits are over
. saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions
.
