one nigt
, during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets
, we went to see
-
- what else
-
- hard rain
.
" so
, are we all going to die
?
" the sheriff
( r
andy quaid
) asks inwhich the story
' s opening line as he evacuates his flooded twon
. the answer is pretty much yes
,
but not nearly soon enough
.
and to add insult to injury
, the supposedly dead
, regretfully
, often turn out not to be so
. populating this bad tv
- movie
- ofthe
- the
- week material are a host of talented actors
. one can only hope they weere rewarded h
andsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture
. besides the obvious hardships ofthe acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water
, they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie
. graham yost
' s script serves up noe cliche after another forthe the actors
, who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines
. directer mikael salomon
' s staging is so confusing that you may have trouble figuring out what is happening
. the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies
, jr
.
' s dark anbd ugly cinematography
. the plot concerns an armored car that gets stuck in the raging water
. onboard are guards tom
and his uncle charlie
. christian slater
, who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart
, plays tom
. edward asner drops by briefly tothe take on the role of the soon to be dead charlie
. coming to their
" rescue
" is a gang headed by jim
, played on autopilot by the great actor morgan freeman
. he views the loot
, three million dollars worth
, as his retirement plan
. the entire movie is oen big watery chase with the sherif
and his posse tracking jim
and his gang
, who are in turn after tom
. along the way
, tom picks up a love interest in the person of a crucifix
- weapon wielding woman named karen
, played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver
. the action sequences are repetitive
and without much interest
. they do feature lots of explosions
and gunfire to keep you awake
. christopher young
' s emotionless score forthe the film has a single trait
, ear
- shattering loudness
. yhe plot holes are as big as tje ones in the dam that breaks
, submerging the town
. the characters have an infinite number of bullets
and rarely do they have to bother reloading their guns
. the weapons
and the ammunition spend most of yhe time under water or being rained on
but always fire perfectly
. when one of thte bad guys drops a gun into the water
, it stays in the smae place until much later when tom swims to get it
, even
though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees
. counting these improbabilities is one of thte more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait for the characters to kill each otehr
. the show has a single
,
but unprintable
, good line
. betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife
,
and
, when her hen
- pecked husb
and finally told her off
, our audeince roared with laughter
. the show concludes with a sickening set of twists
. the best that can be said of the picture is that it is merely stupefyingly awful as opposed to laughably bad
. hard rain runs 1
: 37
. it is rated r for violence
and would be fine for teenagers
.
( the two families behind us shockingly had a half
- dozen preschoolers among them
.
