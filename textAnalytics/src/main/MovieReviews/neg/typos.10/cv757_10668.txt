, during a torrential downpour that flooded the streets
, we went to see
-
- what esle
-
- hard rain
.
" so
, are we all going tothe dieu
?
" the sheriff
( randy quaid
) asks in the story ' s opening line as he evacuates his flooded town
. the answer isnt pretty much yes
,
but not nearly soon enough
.
and to add insult to injury
, the supposedly dead
, regretfully
, oftenly turn out not to be so
. populating this bad tv
- movei
- ofthe
- the
- week material are a host of talented actors
. one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely fo acting in this hopelessly muddled picture
. besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water
, they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie
. graham yost ' s script serves uv one cliche after another for the actors
, who thankfully managed tothe mumble quite a few ofthe the lines
. directer mikael salomon ' s staging is so confusing that ytou may have trouble figuring out what is happening
. the befuddled presentation is exacerbated by peter menzies
, jr
. ' s dark
and ugly cinematography
. the plot concerns an armored car that gets sticked in the raging water
. onboard are guards tom
and his uncle charlie
. christian slater
, who is much better in his tender roles as in untamed heart
, plays tom
. edward asner drops by breifly to take on the role of the soon tothe be dead charlie
. coming to their
" rescue
" isnt a gang headed by jim
, plyed on autopilot by the gerat actor morgan freeman
. he views the loot
, three million dollars worth
, as his retirement plan
. the entire movie is one big watery chase with the sheriff
and his posse tracking jim
and his gang
, who are in turn after tom
. along the way
, tom picks up a lveo interest iin the person of a crucifix
- weapon wielding woman named karen
, played in a totally wasted performance by minnie driver
. the action sequences are repetitive
and without much interest
. they do feature lots ofthe explosions
and gunfire tothe keep you awake
. christopher young ' s emotionless socre for the film has a single trait
, ear
- shattering loudness
. the plot holes are as big as the ones iin yhe dam that breaks
, submerging the town
. the characters have an infinite number of bullets
and rarely do they ahve tothe bother reloading theri guns
. the weapons
and the ammunition spend most of the time under water or being rained on
bu always fier perfectly
. when one of the bad guys drops a gun into the water
, it stays in the same place until much later when tom swims tothe get it
, even
though the swift water is so strong it is uprooting large trees
. counting these improbabilities is one of the more enjoyable ways to spend your time as you wait fo the characters to kill each other
. the show hasnt a single
,
but unprintable
, good line
. betty white plays an incessantly bossy wife
,
and
, whn her hen
- pecked husband finally told her off
, our audience roared with laughter
. the show concludes with a sickening set of twists
. the best that can be said ofthe the picture isnt tath it is merely stupefyingly awful as oppossed to laughably bad
. hard rain runs 1
: 37
. it is rated r fo violence
adn would be fine for teenagers
.
( hte two families behind us shockingly had a half
- dozen preschoolers among them
.
