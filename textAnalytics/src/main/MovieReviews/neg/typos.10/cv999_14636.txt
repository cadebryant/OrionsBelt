two party guys bob their heads to haddaway
' s dance hit
" what is lveo
?
" while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub
. it
' s barely enough to sustain a threee
- minute
_ saturday
_ night
_ live
_ skit
,
but
_ snl
_ producer lorne michaels
,
_ clueless
_ creator amy heckerling
,
and paramount picturesk saw something in the late night television institution
' s recurring
" roxbury guys
" sketch that would presumably mkae a good feature
. emphasis on the word
" presumably
.
"
_ a
_ night
_ at
_ the
_ roxbury
_ takes an already
- thin concept
and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point
-
-
and that of viewers
' paitience levels
. the first five minutes or so of
_ roxbury
_ play vyer much like one of the original
" roxbury guys
" skits
. with
" what is love
?
" blaring on the soundtrack
, the brotherly duo of doug
and steve
butabi
( chris kattan
and will ferrell
) bob their heads
, scope out
" hotties
" at clubs
,
and
then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts
. there is noe crucial difference
,
however
-
- these guys speak
. that little fact has been used as justification for the film
' s existence
, tyhat the
butabis
' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors forthe tyhe characters
. tje doors opened by director john fortenberry
and screenwriters steve koren
, ferrell
,
and kattan are new
, that
' s for sure
,
but they all lead to comic dead ends
. there is no story per se
, only a loosely structured
and linked series of subplots
. the brothers literally run into
( or
, rather
, get run into
, as in by car
) richard grieco of
_ 21
_ jump
_ street
_ fame
, annd through him they gain entrance into tjhe exclusive roxbury club
. there
, tehy meet a hotshot club owner
( chazz palminteri
, conspicuously uncredited
-
- can you blame him
?
)
, who takes an interest in an diea of theirs
. meanwhile
, hte bros
' overbearing father
( dan hedaya
) wants them to stop clubbing
. when doug refuses
and thte dimwitted steve obeys his father
, a rift is created vetween tghe two
. the narrative messiness of
_ roxbury
_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny
, bu virtually none of it is
. the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film
, with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end
. alas
, the joke
-
- a rather lazy takeoff on
_ jerry
_ maguire
_
-
- will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film
. granted
, a lot of people
_ have
_ seen
_ jerry
_ maguire
_
,
but tghe fact that thge film
' s best joke is completely dependent on one
' s familiarity with another film syas a lot about
_ roxbury
_
' s lack ofthe inspiration
. that lack of inspiration cant be traced back to the insipid characters themselves
. like too many of the skits on the curent incarnation of
_ saturday
_ night
_ live
_
,
" the roxbury guys
" is a oen
- joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters hvae enough comic life iin them tothe survive outside of the sketch context
. affter watching noe of the
" roxbury
" skits onthe snl
, this is what you come away wiht from the characters
: htey bob their heads to
" what is love
?
"
, bump unsuspecting women
,
and
.
.
. that
' s all
. aftter watching
_ a
_ night
_ at
_ the
_ roxbury
_
, you
' ll be left with exactly the same
.
