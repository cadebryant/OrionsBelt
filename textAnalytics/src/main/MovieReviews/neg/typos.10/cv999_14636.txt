two party guys bob their heads to haddaway ' s dance hit
" what is love
?
" while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub
. it ' s barely enough to sustain a three
- minute
_ saturday
_ night
_ live
_ skit
,
but
_ snl
_ producer lorne michaels
,
_ clueless
_ creator amy heckerling
,
and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution ' s recurring
" roxbury guys
" sketch that woudl presumably make a good feature
. emphasis on the owrd
" presumably
.
"
_ a
_ night
_ at
_ the
_ roxbury
_ takes an already
- thin consept
and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point
-
-
and that of viewers ' patience levels
. the first five minutes or so of
_ roxbury
_ play very much like one of tyhe original
" roxbury guys
" skits
. with
" what is love
?
" blaring on the soundtrack
, the brotherly duo of doug
anbd steve butabi
( chris kattan
and will ferrell
) bob their heads
, scope out
" hotties
" at clubs
,
and
then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts
. there is one crucial difference
,
however
-
- these guys speak
. that little fact has been used as justification for the film ' s existence
, that the butabis ' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters
. the doors opened by directer john fortenberry
and screenwriters steve koren
, ferrell
,
and kattan are new
, that ' s for sure
,
but they all lead to comic dead ends
. there is no story per se
, only a loosley structured
and linked series of subplots
. the brothers literally run into
( or
, rather
, get run into
, as in by car
) richard grieco of
_ 21
_ jump
_ street
_ fame
,
and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club
. there
, they meet a hotshot club owner
( chazz palminteri
, conspicuously uncredited
-
- can you blame him
?
)
, who takes an interest inthe an idea of theirs
. meanwhile
, the bros ' overbearing father
( dan hedaya
) wants them to stop clubbing
. when doug refuses
and the dimwitted steve obeys his father
, a rift is created between the two
. the narrative messiness of
_ roxbury
_ would have been forgivable if all that went on weere the slightest bit funny
,
but virtually none of it is
. the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film
, with hte one big exception being a big laugh near the end
. alas
, thte joke
-
- a rether lazy takeoff on
_ jerry
_ maguire
_
-
- will only strike a chord with people who have seen thta film
. granted
, a lot of people
_ have
_ seen
_ jerry
_ maguire
_
,
but tghe fact that the film ' s best joke is completely dependent on one ' s familiarity with another film says a lot about
_ roxbury
_ ' s lack of inspiration
. that lack of insperation can be traced back tothe the insipid characters themselves
. like too many of yhe skits on teh current incarnation of
_ saturday
_ night
_ live
_
,
" the roxbury guys
" is a one
- joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context
. after watching one of the
" roxbury
" skits on snl
, htis is what you come away with from the characters
: they bob their heads to
" what is love
?
"
, bump unsuspecting women
,
and
.
.
. that ' s all
. after watching
_ a
_ night
_ at
_ the
_ roxbury
_
, you ' ll be left with exactly the same
.
