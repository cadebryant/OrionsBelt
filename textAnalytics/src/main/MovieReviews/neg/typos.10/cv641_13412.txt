. don
' t forget tothe recommend a film
, read the jurnal
, or send me some of that nasty hate mail
.
) starring bruce willis
, billy bob thornton
, liv tyler
, ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh
and j
. j
. abrams directed by michael bay it rocks
- actually
, lots of rocks fly at us or from us
, inthe slow or fast motion
, at several points in the film
. they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propeling forward
,
and when they l
and
- once inspite a while
, when we need a break from the space sequences
- htey cause damage enough to destroy tyhe chrysler building annd the like
.
( nary a mention ofthe these apocalyptic events is made after they occur
.
) they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon
, a steroid user
' s answer to deep impact
. bruce willis stars as harry stamper
, a famed oil
- driller commissioned by hte white house
and nasa to stpo a giant asteroid before it travels beyond
" zero barrier
"
and destroys our planet
. why an oil driller
? they require someone experienced with deep
- core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid
.
( in one unintentionally
(
?
) hilarious sequence
, nasa asks harry to inspect a deep
- core driller they built based on his own blueprints
; it is poorly constructed
- harry criticizes almost every aspect of it
. we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can l
and on twirling asteroids
?
) harry assembles the obligatory
" ragtag
" bunch of
" cowboys
"
, including a blond guy
, a fat guy
, a black guy
, a wiseass
,
and the man who isnt sleeping with his daughter
( affleck
)
. once they reach space
, we experience sequence after sequence of something gogin wrong
- perhaps the fact that tehy sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space hasnt something to do with it
; i cannnot count the number of times they almost fail tje mission on all my fingers
and toes
. whether or not they save the day
, i will not reveal
. nor will you care
. i will say this
: you know you
' re in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion
and scope
. willis hasnt barely a chance to come alive
; ditto fo affleck
. their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act
, iin a last minute
-
and futile
- attempt to inject warmth inot the material
. steve buscemi
' s character
- the wiseass
- isnt exceptionally problematic
.
" rockhound
"
, as he
' s called
, is sarcastic adn foolish
, so they tape him tothe a chair
, where he spends most of the film
. so why did they bring him up there to begin witht
? rather
, why write him inot the film
?
- give his almsot
- witty oney
- liners to serious willis
, who scowls
and mopes
and demonstrates psychotic tendencies
: at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter
, firing often
and causing signficiant damage to his oil rig
. i
' m guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel
, at least in my world where the sky is blue
. liv tyler is pretty
and humourless
, as always
; suspiciously
, four of her father
' s b
and
' s
(
" aerosmith
"
) songs grace tghe soundtrack
. director michael bay lays tghe visual
and sound effects on thick
, like ketchup
, eventually drowning the movei on
- screen
.
( the middle hour is a non
- sensical
, pyrotechnic assault on the average primate
' s brain
.
) whenever someone dies in this movie
, a crew memeber inevitably yells out
" we lost
( insert dead person
' s last name here
)
!
" i must admit that nto once could i distinguish a dead oil
- guy
- cum
- astronaut from a live one
,
and close
- ups of the corpses
' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assisstance
, as their skin was often covered in fake blood
. armageddon is nto as terrible movie as godzilla
. it looks nicer
,
and has fewer plot
- holes within its equally ludicrous framework
. it has a vivid soundmix
.
but at almost two
-
and
- a
- half hours
, i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story
. the love story has beeen played up in the ads
, perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic
- fever
. bollocks
! the lovers infact yhe film are miles apart throughout
- erase all
thoughts of nude sketching or car
- sex adn replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up hwile ben affleck dicks around in a moon
- crawler
. remember a littel film called jaws
? in this film
, three indepedent
- minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in persuit of a deadly shark
. they didn
' t much like each otehr at first
; eventually
, htey started to respect one another
. one of jaws
' great scenes involved the owudl
- be
- ahabs drinking
and singing songs
and telling stories
. this isnt the sort of male
- bonding foregn to bay or his producer
, jerry bruckheimer
, who throw too many characters into the mix adn expect we
' ll care about them on the grounds that the world isnt baout tothe end
. not once dont we git the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances
- i
' d be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one anyother before
" action
" was called
. a male friend who loved the film suggested to me thast perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don
' t bare their souls
, who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism
and a kind of chest
- beating bravery
. tothe this
, i will respond that the boys infront armageddon are neither heroic
, nor brave
, nor smart
, even
: this team couldn
' t build a birdhouse
.
and if i get noone respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer
- a trailer for a movie written by a team of body
- builders
and greeting card authors
- i
' ve never been a prouder wimp my whole life
