libby parsons
( ashley judd
) has the perfect littel life
-
- a rich husb
and
, a cute son
,
and a house on the ocean
-
-
but when her husb
and nick
( bruce greenwood
) takes her sailing
, she awakes tothe find him gone
and her h
ands covered withthe blood
. just as she makes it to the deck
and picks up the bloody knife lying there
, the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husban sent
. she
' s convicted ofthe his murder
, of course
,
and leaves her son matty
( benjamin weir
) with her best friend
( annabeth gish
)
. time passes
,
and the friend disappears with matty
. during their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell
" daddy
!
"
and realizes that her husb
and is still alive
. libby serves six years
, growing harder
and driven by the desire to kill nick
( based on the theory that because of the
" double jeopardy
" amendment she can off him with impunity
)
. when she gets parole
, she
' s sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman
( tommy lee jones
)
, a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident
. after a little breaking
and entering
and some destruction of property
, libby jumps parole
and lams it across the country looking for nick
and matty
. travis pursues
, natuarlly
.
" double jeopardy
" is a watered
- down version of
" the fugitive
,
" with jones sleep
- walking through his well
- worn pursuer persona
.
al
though libby never leaps fomr a bus that collides with a train
, she manages to get into a faw nail
- biters
-
- chased down tghe beach by a jeep
, chained to a car that plunges inot the ocean
, sealed in a coffin
-
- that add some much needed thrills tothe an anemic
, slow
- moving script
. character delevopment is thin
. travis
' intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times
but has no effect on the story
.
( i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the double
- jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick
. it
' s a long way tothe go for one line
)
. there
' s considerable sexual tension between travis
and libby
( hey
, there
' s something
" the fugitive
" didn
' t have
!
)
,
but it never goes anywhere
. libby is a tv
- movie everywoman
,
but judd
' s intense performance draws us in
and makes us forget that her character hasnt no distinguishing characteristics
. htis isnt judd
' s most prominent role to date
,
and she proves that she can light up the screen
. let
' s hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around
. the quality of directer bruce beresford
' s movies seems to depend on luck
. when he has a good script
and a strong cast
, he turns out oscar
- caliber work like
"
' breaker
' morant
,
"
" driving miss daisy
,
" anbd
" tender mercies
.
" when he doesn
' t
.
.
. we get
" double jeopardy
.
" screenwriters david weisberg
and douglas cook previously collaborated on
" the rock
,
" a script which probably benefited from thge numerous uncredited rewrites
. bottom line
: ashley judd tries hard
but can
' t savve htis predictable bore
.
