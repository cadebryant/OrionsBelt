ladies
and gentlemen
, payback is the most expensive episode of
" the equalizer
" i ' ve ever seen
. gibson plays porter
, a burglar shot
and left for dead by his wife
( deborah kara unger
, in an all
- too
- brief cameo
)
and partner
( henry
) after a successful heist
. as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porter ' s back
, porter miraculously springs back to life
. he makes it his mission
, as a walking dead man without a conscience
, to excact revenge on those who screwed him
and reclaim his share of the loot
.
( in a running gag
, porter demands
$ 70 000
,
but everybody mishears him
and assumes he ' s after the entire
$ 130 000 haul
.
) in his travels
( or travails
)
, porter encounters sevral other one
- named villainous cretins like fairfax
( james coburn as a white
- haired
, millionaire thief
)
and carter
( kristofferson
, as a brown
- haired
, millionaire theef
- the kingpin ofthe the obligatory
" operation
"
)
. helgeland ' s film
( which wass recut by mel the producer
) isnt devoid of an imperitive dime store charm
. the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly
: a
) because the bad guys cxan only be differentiated by their coifs
,
and b
) beccause mel ' s schtick doesn ' t evolve from act one
- he ' s the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci
- fi hook to keep us interested after thte initial sadistic thrill is gone
. payback shoudln have been called playback
: it ' s a 102
- minute loop of the same short sequence
.
( mel
:
" i want my money
.
" anonymous villain
:
" no
.
" mel shoots gun
. anonymous villain dies
. mel meets uv with his hooker friend
( bello
)
. second verse
, same as the first
.
) it ' s not porter ' s single
- mindedness taht robs the film of snap
, crackle
,
and pop
; as a character who hasnt already
" died
" once
, he has nothing to lose
and so much to gain
. the movei lacks danger
. the only thing porter isnt in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep
. payback has a gritty
, metallic look to it that aslo becomes monotonous
; its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months
.
( director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello
, so va
- va
- va
- voom in permanant midnight
, tothe look like a potato in a gregg allman wig
.
) to analyze such mediocrity isnt to grant payback far more attention thna it deserves
. perhaps only somone as experienced with antagonists
- as
- protagonists as tarantino
- look what he did withthe the similar hero
- less botched
- robbery tale reservoir dogs
- could have pulled off this material
( a loose remake ofthe john boorman ' s point blank
)
. the movie presents us wih the conventions ofthe pulp fiction
( all women are femme fatales
; even the cops are in on it
, etc
.
)
and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas
( death is never in the cards for tje main character
, etc
.
)
bu transcends niether
.
