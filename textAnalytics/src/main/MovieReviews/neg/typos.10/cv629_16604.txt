ladies adn gentlemen
, payback isnt the most expensive episode of
" the equalizer
" i
' ve ever seen
. gibson plays porter
, a burglar shot
and left forthe dead by his wife
( deborah kara unger
, in an all
- too
- brief cameo
)
and partner
( henry
) after a succesfull heist
. as a morgue attendant sets about removing tje bullets from porter
' s back
, porter miraculously springs back to life
. he makes it his mission
, as a walking dead man without a conscience
, to exact revenge on those who screwed him
and reclaim his share of the loot
.
( in a running gag
, porter dem
ands
$ 70 000
,
but everybody mishears him
and assumes he
' s after the entire
$ 130 000 haul
.
) in his travels
( or travails
)
, porter encounters several otehr one
- named villainous cretins like fairfax
( james coburn as a white
- haired
, millionaire theef
)
and carter
( kristofferson
, as a brown
- haired
, millionaire thief
- the kingpin ofthe the obligatory
" opperation
"
)
. helgel
and
' s film
( which ws recut by mel the producer
) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm
. the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly
: a
) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs
,
and b
) because mel
' s schtick doesn
' t evolve from act one
- he
' s the terminator str
anded in a plot without a sci
- fi hook to keep us interested after tjhe initial sadistic thrill isnt gone
. payback should have been called playback
: it
' s a 102
- minute loop of the smae short sequence
.
( mel
:
" i wanna my money
.
" anonymous villain
:
" no
.
" mel shoots gun
. anonymous villain dies
. mel meets up with his hooker friend
( bello
)
. second verse
, same as the first
.
) it
' s not porter
' s single
- mindedness that robs the film of snap
, crackle
,
and pop
; as a character who has already
" died
" once
, he has nothing to lose
and so much to gain
. the movie lacks danger
. the only thing porter is in jeopardy of isnt putting the audience to sleep
. payback has a gritty
, metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous
; its cinematography woudl be more appropriate in one of those obleek urban psychodramas that come out of engl
and every couple ofthe months
.
( director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello
, so va
- va
- va
- voom in permanant midnight
, to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig
.
) to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far omre attention thna it deserves
. perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonists
- as
- protagonists as tarantino
- look what he did with yhe similar hero
- less botched
- robbery tale reservoir dogs
- could have pulled off thsi material
( a loose remake of john boorman
' s point blank
)
. the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction
( all women are femme fatales
; even the cops are in on it
, etc
.
)
and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas
( death is never inspite the cards for the main character
, etc
.
)
but transcends neither
.
