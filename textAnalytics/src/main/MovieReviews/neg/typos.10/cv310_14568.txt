i ' m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success ofthe scream
,
but i ' m guessing after just because it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft
. seriously
, this idea
-
- a pyscho bumping off people in the style of urban legends
-
- is a great one
and i wish it could have been pulled off
. the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue
. an example
:
" that
[ car kresh
] must ' ve been awful
.
.
. for everyone involved
.
" you can tell that the writer intended taht something a little more airy was supposed to have been said
, just no one figured out whta
. i know in slasher movies ther isn ' t supposed to be a lot ofthe great characterization
adn i myself don ' t mind cardboard cutouts
,
but please don ' t let the cutouts be so damn bland
. one reason movies like scream
, star wars
and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters
. aside from jared leto
and joshua jackson
( who aren ' t on the screen long enough
) no one inwhich urban legend makes the grade
. alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill
, rebecca gayheart actually looks unattractive
( not to mention as dumb as a post thru 3
/ 4 of tghe film
)
and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot
. ogod thing brad dourif is here
,
but wait
.
.
. he ' s onyl inspite the movie for five minutes
_
and
_ he ' s just redoing his good
- natured stuttering character from one flew over the cuckoo ' s nest
. which brings me to another aspect of urban legend
: it ' s unoriginality
. the film most blatantly ripped off is scream
( another reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven ' s
and williamson ' s great success
)
. urban legend tries tothe deconstruct modern
- day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films
,
but it doesn ' t quite succeed
. it ' s best stab at self
- reflexivity is poking fun at
" that girl iin the noxzeema ad
"
( ie
, rebecca gayheart
) we also have another killer
- taunting
- his
- victim
- on
- the
- phone routine infact urban legend
and quick
, waht movie is this exchange of dialogue from
: female protagonist
: why
? villain
: why
? why
?
!
? congradulations to those of you who answered scream
and
/ or urban legend
. like i said
, htis movie could ' ve beeen great
. if only silvio had worked or beeen allowed to work a little longer on tjhe script
. still
, at least urban legend had soem preety cool death scenes
and a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i know what you did last summer
.
