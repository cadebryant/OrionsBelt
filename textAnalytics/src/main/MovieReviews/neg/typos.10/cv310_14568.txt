i
' m not sure if silvio horta wrote urban legend before or after the success of scream
,
but i
' m guessing after jstu beccause it seems he may not have had time to write a second draft
. seriously
, htis idea
-
- a psycho bumping off people in the style of urban legends
-
- is a great noe
and i wish it could have been pulled off
. the first sign of trouble comes with the painfully insipid dialogue
. an example
:
" thta
[ car crash
] must
' ve been awful
.
.
. for everyone involved
.
" you can tell that the writter intended that something a little more airy was supposed to have been said
, just no one figured out what
. i know in slasher movies ther isn
' t supposed to be a lot of great characterization
and i myself don
' t mind cardboard cutouts
,
but please don
' t let the cutouts be so damn bl
and
. one reason movies like scream
, star wars
and diva have become so treasured is because they feature charismatic actors playing interesting characters
. aside from jared leto
and joshua jackson
( who aren
' t on the screen long enough
) no one in urban legend makes the grade
. alicia witt shows none of the acerbity or wit she displayed on cybill
, rebecca gayheart atually looks unattractive
( not to mention as dumb as a post through 3
/ 4 of the film
)
and robert englund just cruises on auto pilot
. good thnig brad dourif is here
, bu wait
.
.
. he
' s only in the movei for five minutes
_
and
_ he
' s just redoing his good
- natured stuttering character from noe flew over the cuckoo
' s nest
. which brings me to anyother aspect of urban legend
: it
' s unoriginality
. the film most blatantly ripped off is scream
( anohter reason that makes me think silvio horta wrote this after craven
' s
and williamson
' s great success
)
. urban legend tries to deconstruct modern
- day folklore much the same way scream deconstructed slasher films
,
but it doesn
' t quite succeed
. it
' s best stab at self
- reflexivity is poking fun at
" that girl in the noxzeema ad
"
( ie
, rebecca gayheart
) we also have another killer
- taunting
- his
- victum
- on
- the
- phone routine in urban legend
and quick
, what movie is this exchange of dialogue from
: female protagonist
: why
? villain
: why
? why
?
!
? congradulations to those of you who answered scream
and
/ or urban legend
. like i said
, this movie could
' ve been graet
. if only silvio had worked or been allowed to work a littel longer on the scirpt
. still
, at least urban legend had some pretty cool death scenes anbd a somewhat realized whodunit angle which makes this slasher is waaaayyyyyy better than i konw what you did last summer
.
