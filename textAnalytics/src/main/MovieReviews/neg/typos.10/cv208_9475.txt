one would think that david duchovny
, star of the cult favorite
" x
- files
" would be very carefull in choosing his leading man cinema roles
. at least one would hope so
. oney would be seriously incorrect
. eugene s
ands
( duchovny
) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft thta he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake
and work more
. it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient
and his license while under the influence
. ten months later
, in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin
, thte doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer
. useing a plastic water bottle
and bar tubing
, s
ands operates
and saves his life
. smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom
( timothy hutton
) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his assoicate
. he kidnaps
and
then offers down
-
and
- out eugene a position in his organization
. blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that owudl be problematic at a hospital
. s
and
' s temptation is that this will give him a chance to pratice medicine again albeit illegally
, big chunks of cash to fuel his habit
and close proximity to the gangster
' s womanfriend claire
( angelina jolie
)
, tihs film
' s babe factor
. the would
- be big time operator is desperately in ened of help
. on the run from russian mobsters
( the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this year
' s films
)
and trying tothe cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia
, blossom is surrounded by blood
. after a few medical misadventures
, thte physician grows disenchanted withthe his employment
. an encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he
" fixes
" thier dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work
. when the fbi visits
and forces him to become an informant
, there is no question that he needs to be somewhere esle
. oddly enough
, these seem like they could be exciting scenes
. thte film disproves that assumption
.
then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen
. writing this only two days after seeing the film
, its a struggle to remember the events
. you can take that as a solid lack of recommendation
. for all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in

"
, it
' s a suprize that his big screen presence is so lacking in karisma
. the doctor is particularly bl
and
and dull
. even the cold turkey bit which is rife wtih dramatic possibilities come across as banal
. a little chocolate
and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal
. like virtually everything else in the film
, it
' s a missed opportunity
. the fox mulder detachment doesn
' t work here
. oscar
- winner hutton
' s manic mobster is much more difficult to get a h
andle onthe
. played partially for comedy
and partially as crazed killer
, blossom almost becomes real
,
but
then sinks into goofiness
. most of the time hutton looks as if he
' s searching for his character
and coming up empty
. jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three
- dimensional human being befor giving uv
and turning into scenery
. thge most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen
. the rest aren
' t any better
. michael massee
' s eccentric fbi agent never revs up
. one of blossom
' s henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky gunman reminiscent ofthe val kilmer
' s doc holliday in
" tombstone
"
. his two
- gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film
. bu that 15 seconds isn
' t worth sitting through the other 90 minutes
. first time film director
andy wilson
( known for his work on the british television series
" cracker
"
) appears to be attempting to jump on the
" pulp fiction
" b
andwagon
. the best of these movies combine a sense ofthe style
and flash with signifigant substance
. the second
- rate ones concentrate on just one of these aspects
.
" playing god
" doesnt neither well
. the basic idea of the film is solid
.
and
then it goes nowhere
. even worse
, it plods back
and forth
, up
and down a long
and winding road befoer it ends up nowhere
. fox fails
yet again in his search forthe intelligent life
.
