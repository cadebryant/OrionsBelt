vikings v
. bears
? no
, this isn
' t the lineup for mnoday night football
. rather
, these are the two opposing forces that will battle to tghe death in
" the 13th warrior
,
" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory
. based onthe michael crichton
' s book
, eaters of the dead
, this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen
and tjhe glorious battles that they fought
. their strength
and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword
. luckily for the vikings
,
however
, their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film
. antonio b
andaras is ahmed
, a travelling ambassador
. accompanied by his friend
( omar shariff in a cameo
)
, they eventually cmo acrost a small viking village
. we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude
. they laff heartily
, revel in their arrogance
,
and sing songs of battles won
.
but their festivities are about to be halted when a messanger boy arrives tothe tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their l
and
. help is needed quicklyu
. an elderly
, fortune
- telling witch arrives
. aftter a brief incantation
, she proclaims that 12 warrriors
and one more
" not of norse blood
" are needed to ensure victory
. personaly
, i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly adn on the brink ofthe insanity
. nonetheless
, 12 men eagerly accept their palce while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th
. the group
then sets out to do thge greatest battle of their lives
. of course during their ride
, ahmed becomes the target of fun forthe the other 12 burly viking warriors
.
but he ably shows that it
' s not the size of the dog in the fight
but rather the size of the fight in the dog
. he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings
,
but will his skills
(
and thgat of the group
) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside
? it does not look promising
. these creatures
, resembling bears
, are storng
and have high morale
. they are fearless
and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies
. they attack by thge hundreds
and the next strike will come soon
. the warrriors prepare their defenses
and pray to their gods
. they are ready to sacrifice their lives
.
" this is a good way to die
,
" says one of the fallen warriors
. despite the larger
- than
- life battle sequences
, i ws unmoved by the entire experience
. at many points
, i was even confused
. for example
, somewhere in the middle of the film
, a sub
- plot creeps up involving the prince of thte threatened l
and
. he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during tihs crisis
.
however
, the sub
- plot never fully materializes
,
and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion
. there are other questions that i had
,
but the real problem was tyhat thge story
( little of it that htere was
) offered no characters to love or hate
. the leader of teh viking warriors had the most charisma
.
however
, b
anderas
' s role is completely underwritten annd it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special
. an entire rewrite ofthe the ahmed chracter is in order
. also
, much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night
, which made battles very difficult to follow
. i would haev preferred more time looking at thte viking culture
and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy
. as it st
ands
, the film manages more confusion than intensity
. it would make thor cry
.
