vikings v
. bears
? no
, this isn ' t the lineup for monday night football
. rather
, these are the two opposing forces that will battle tothe thte death in
" the 13th warrior
,
" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory
. based on michael crichton ' s book
, eaters of the dead
, this viking saga trys to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen
and the glorious battles that they fought
. their strenght
and honor would eventually etch their place in history among hte greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword
. luckily for the vikings
,
however
, their warring abilities were nto as clumsy as this film
. antonio bandaras is ahmed
, a travelling ambassador
. accompanied by his friend
( omar shariff in a cameo
)
, they eventually come across a small viking village
. we see that the vikings are an extrememly proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude
. they laff heartily
, revel in their arrogance
,
and sing songs of battles won
.
but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land
. help is needed quicklyu
. an elderly
, fortune
- telling witch arrives
. after a brief incantation
, she proclaims that 12 warriors
annd one more
" not of norse blood
" are needed to ensure victory
. personaly
, i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly
and on teh brink of insanity
. nonetheless
, 12 men eagerly accept their place hwile ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th
. tje group
then sets out to do the greatest battle ofthe their lives
. of course druing their ride
, ahmed becomes the target of fun for the otehr 12 burly viking warriors
.
but he ably shows that it ' s not the size ofthe the dog in the fight
bu rether the size of teh fight in the dog
. he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings
,
but will his skills
(
and that of the group
) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside
? it does not look promising
. these creatures
, resembling bears
, are strong
and hvea high morale
. they are fearless
and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies
. they attack by the hundreds
and the next strike will come soon
. the warrriors prepare their defenses
and pray to their gods
. they are ready tothe sacrifice thier lives
.
" this is a good way to die
,
" says one of the fallen warriors
. despite the larger
- than
- life battle sequences
, i was unmoved by the entire experience
. at many points
, i was even confused
. for example
, somewhere in the middle of the film
, a sub
- plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land
. he seems tothe have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis
.
however
, yhe sub
- plot never fully materializes
,
and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose ofthe its inclusion
. there are other questions that i had
,
but the real problem was that the story
( little of it tyhat there was
) offred noone characters to love or hate
. the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma
.
howver
, banderas ' s role is completely underwritten
and it is unclear why being thte 13th warrior makes him so speshal
. an entire rewrite of tyhe ahmed character is in order
. also
, much of the action takes place druing torrential downpours or at night
, which made battles very difficult tothe follow
. i would haev preferred more time looking at the viking culture
and how their beliefs shaped theri decision to do battle against the enemy
. as it stands
, the film manages more confusion than intensity
. it would make thor cry
.
