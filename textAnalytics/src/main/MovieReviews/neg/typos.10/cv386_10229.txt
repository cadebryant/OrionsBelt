soem concepts seem patently hopeless from the beginning
, a live
- action version ofthe mr
. magoo being a prime example
. the cartoon figure mr
. magoo
, the bumbling blind man
, can be quite funny
,
but only in small doses
and only within the confines of animated images
. if you thikn naked gun star leslie nielsen is a dubious choice to play the role of the short guy who runs into walls
, you are right
,
but there is an even more astonishing selection
. for a director they tapped hong kong
' s stanley tong
, whose resume consists mainly of a h
andful of movies featuring martial arts expert jackie chan
. the stoy
, such that there is one
, is baout a large
, stolen ruby
, which looks a woolworth reject
. mr
. magoo gets it
and
, of course
, does not relize he hasnt it
. mayhem hten ensues as the bad
and the good guys chase each other with mr
. magoo frequently oblivious to yhe fact that anyone is being chased
. like hmeo alone 3
but without any class
, mr
. magoo can only be described as painfully bad
. fifteen minutes of it feels like an eternity
. the movie
' s humor is pathetically lame
,
and the pacing is way off
. when oen is stuck in a theater for an hour
and a half watching what claims to be a motion picture
, one looks forthe some solace
. mr
. magoo provides only three such moments
. the movie begins
and ends with the classic cartoon version of the character
, who exudes his usual charm
. tjhe only other saving grave in the movie itself is angus
, the sweet littel bulldog
. angus demonstrates more genuine emotions
and a wider acting range than any of the humans in the picture
. finaly
, the ending credits contain outtakes of tjhe movie
, which have smoe of teh genuineness
and spontaneity that the movie badly lacked
. rather than attempt tothe adapt mr
. magoo to a non
- cartoon movie
, nielsen makes the strategic mistake of trying to literally be a human version of the ctaroon
. he has trouble sustaining the squinting eyes
and the affected voice
,
and even when he does it comes off as awkwardly unfunny
. my wief managed to get some sleep during the movie
,
but i was not so lucky
. hopefully
, this picture will force producers to think harder baout which subjects have promise
and which do not
. mr
. magoo runs 1
: 37
. it is rated pg for comic violence
and would be acceptable for all ages
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, said he
thought tyhe movie was good anbd really funny
,
but recommends you not choose it if yuo want an action movie
. he said he liked home alone 3 much more
. his friend maxim
, age 9
, said that he
thought it was good
but very silly anbd parts did not make sense
. his other friend nickolas
, age 8
, said he
' d give the movie

but that it was really silly
