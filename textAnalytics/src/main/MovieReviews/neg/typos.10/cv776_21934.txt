the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film
" the world is not enough
" is its final frame
: white letters on a black background proclaiming
" james bond will return
.
" oh i certainly hope not
. with pierce brosnan in his third
and reportedly lsat go
- round as james bond 007
,
" the world is nto enough
" is tghe best example to date that
"
' enough
" is enought
. in this
, tje 19th chapter in the seemingly
- endless franchise featuring ian fleming
' s debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis
-
-
and his nemeses
-
- shaken not stirred
, teh sub
- inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups
, stunts
,
and sexy encounters ofthe the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything tje slightest bit original
. we
' ve got previously
- used speedboat chases
, ski chases
,
and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines
. we
' ve got a couple of hot
- to
- trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them
. we
' ve got a post
- cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash desctruction
( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean
, lean panache
)
.
and
, as has been the case since 1977
' s
" the spy who loved me
,
" we
' ve got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr
. fleming
. we
' ve also got a main title song by garbage to which
, with very littel effort
, yuo can fit the lyrics to
* both
* songs from
" tomorrow never dies
.
" while originality was never yhe series
' strong suit
, the films were almost always fun
, with at least some
thought going into the nonstop stunts
. i cant
' t think of one memorable set
- piece in the entire
-
-
and very dull
-
-
" the world is not enough
.
" in addition
, michael apted
( yes
, the respected director ofthe such films as
" coal miner
' s daughter
,
"
" nell
,
"
and the
" 28up
" documentary series
) tkaes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich
? s
. you git the
" talking killer
" plot device
-
- you know the scenario
: the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy
yet waxes poetic jsut long enough to die of old age
.
and you git a slew ofthe high
- priced assassins who can
' t hit a barn door at 20 paces
: inwhich the film
' s opening minutes
( of an endless 128
)
, bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames
and thte leather
- clad lovely fails to hit bond
' s souped
- up
" fishing boat
" with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her
. later
, she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her
but is still unable to take him out
. these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other tahn occasional ads for luxury automobiles
, vodka
, or credit cards
. in
and among thte rampant product placements
, brosnan grapples with carlyle
,
" braveheart
"
' s sophie marceau
( as former kidnap victum slash heiress elektra king
; she
' s terrible
)
,
" wild things
"
' denise richards
( as a nuclear physicist lord help me
; she
' s laughable
)
,
and judi dench as m
. dame judi brings hte only shred of dignity tothe a series that has long since jettisoned its self
- respect
( about the time roger moore inherited bond
' s walther ppk
)
. brosnan goes through the motions with the grace
and charm you
' d expect of the former
" remington steele
" star
,
but even he has to be thinking there
' s more to life than an easy paycheck
. he
' s given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver
,
but only one of them
-
-
" i don
' t know any doctor jokes
"
-
- made me chuckle
(
al
though
" i
thought christmas only comes once a year
" is moreso in keeping with the series
' penchant forthe grown
- worthy puns
)
