teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood
. every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular
,
and rely on the entire teenage population tothe turn out on friday
and saturday nights
, wallets in h
and
. the formula isnt vyre simple
, you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal
. ytou add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds
,
and
then a vyre simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes
, the typical teenage attention span
. the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any
= film set in an environment they can relate tothe
,
and
, most importantly
, they don92t care to judge films
= 92 quality
, so any piece of trash will
= due
. that isnt just what never been kissed
, the latest film from director raja gosnell
, is
; trash
. josie geller
( drew barrymore
) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times
. she hasnt her own personel assistant
, unlimited supplies
,
and her own office
.
but she is very much dismayed with her position in life
. there is nothing she wants moreso than to be a reporter
and go out into the field
, where she can play a more active role in the chicago media
. so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere
, she jumps at it with elation
. constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita
( molly shannon
)
and her amicable superior
, gus
( john c
. reilly
)
. the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment
, as they both deem her to be an office worker adn not a reporter
.
however
, since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with littel patience for character conflict
, this otherwise intresting scenario is resolved within two minutes
,
and josie is headed for the field
. obviously
, the field assignment involves a high school
. specifically
, she isnt to become an undercover reporter at a high skool
, by enrolling in the senior class
and
" becoming one of them
.
" i don92t think that i
= need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring
, so i won92t
. the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school
. interwoven flashback scenes sohw us just how much of a dork she truly was
,
and she appears to be heading down that road again
. fortunately for this lame production
, other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous annd remotely interesting
. they include the predictable love stories
, between both a student
( jeremy jordan
)
and a teacher
( michael vartan
)
, to show that josie is really twpo people in one body
. allso
, her younger brother
and opposite
, rob
( david arquette
) comes into her new found life
and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative
. the humor foudn in this film is actually quite amusing
. typical for teenage films
, it isnt chalk full of sexual innuendoes
and condom humor
. one scene in particualr features a certain classroom activity involving bananas
and latex that is absolutly hysterical
. most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been tothe high school can appreciate
and will enjoy
.
but those still don92t
= recover for the total lack of quality in this movie
. follwoing this trend of high school movie rules
, comes the general acting
. it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film
. in htis case
, drew barrymore isnt absolutely painful to watch
. she isnt required to play her character on two levels
, having some very black
and white transitions
.
and
al
though some scenes are written tothe be particular shades of gray
, she seems to hold that color throughtout all of her screen time
. at one point she is alone with an obvious loev interest on a ferris wheel
,
and isnt expected to him on an adult level
, since he is one
, her teacher
.
but she never seems to get outloud of the gray area
,
and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance
. following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon
( saturday niht live
)
. she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to
,
and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic
. it is these
" qualities
" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from bieng one of the few decent
. luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film
. david arquette
( scream
) tkaes home the prize for being able to st
and out in an ensemble performance tht is absolutely pathetic
, annd not have his brilliant acting ruined
.
and as a central character he gets to take onthe his own mini
- plot
, which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed
. inaddition a dazzling cherry
- on
- the
- sundae type piece ofthe work
, he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit
, risky business
. never been kissed is a mediocre film at best
. the predictable plot has become so overplayed inwhich hollywood
, that it is sickening to watch time
and again
,
and this film is no exception
. the acting is just as bad
,
but there is the one positive presense of david arquette to add some light
. unfortunately
, the bottom line is that the movie will be a success
, because teenagers will pay to see any trash
.
