teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood
. every year countless films will be made targeting that audiance in particular
,
and rely on the entire teenage popluation to turn out on friday
and saturday nights
, wallets in hand
. the formula isnt very simple
, you amking a film withthe a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal
. ytou add a high school enviorment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds
,
and
then a very simple relationship conflict tyhat can be worked out inspite 90 minutes
, the typical teenage attention span
. the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any
= film set in an environment they can relate to
,
and
, most importantly
, they don92t care to judge films
= 92 quality
, so any piece of trash will
= due
. that is just what never been kissed
, the latest film from directer raja gosnell
, is
; trash
. josie geller
( drew barrymore
) is the youngest copy editor in the history ofthe the chicago sun times
. she has her own personel assistant
, unlimited supplies
,
and her own office
.
but she is very much dismayed with her position in life
. there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter
adn go outloud inot the field
, where she can play a more active role in the chicago media
. so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere
, she jumps at it with elation
. constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita
( molly shannon
)
and her amicable superior
, gus
( john c
. reilly
)
. the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment
, as they both deem her to be an office worker
and nto a reporter
.
however
, since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for charactor conflict
, this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes
,
anbd josie isnt headed for the field
. obviously
, the feild assignment involves a high school
. specifically
, she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school
, by enrolling in the senior class
and
" becoming one ofthe them
.
" i don92t think that i
= need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occuring
, so i won92t
. the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school
. interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was
,
and she appears to be heading down that road again
. fortunately forthe this lame production
, other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous
and remotely interesting
. they include the predictable love stories
, between both a student
( jeremy jordan
)
and a teacher
( michael vartan
)
, to show that josie is relaly two people in one body
. also
, her younger brother
and opposite
, rob
( david arquette
) comes into her new found life
and even causes a rare scene that isnt mildly provocative
. the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing
. tipical for teenage films
, it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes
and condom humor
. one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas
anbd latex that is absolutely hysterical
. most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate
and will enjoy
.
but those still don92t
= recover fo the total lack of quality in this movie
. following this trend of high school movie rules
, comes the general acting
. it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film
. in this case
, drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch
. she is required to play her character on two levels
, having some very black
and white transitions
.
and
although some scenes are written to be particualr shades of gray
, she seems to hold that color throughtout all of her screen time
. at noe point she is alone with an obvious love interst on a ferris wheel
,
and is expected to him on an adult level
, since he is one
, her teacher
.
but she never seems to get out of the gray area
,
and in doing so she makes a mockery outloud of his otherwise good performance
. following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon
( saturday ngiht live
)
. she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no noe cin relate to
,
and draws thge attention of an audience as simply unrealistic
. it is these
" qualities
" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one ofthe the faw decent
. luckily there is one great performence to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film
. david arquette
( scream
) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic
,
and not have his brilliant acting ruined
.
and as a central character he gets tothe take on his own mini
- plot
, which is one of tjhe faw well done parts of never been kissed
. in a dazzling cherry
- onthe
- the
- sundae type piece of work
, he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from tyhe 1983 hitted
, risky busness
. never been kissed is a mediocre film at best
. the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood
, that it is sickening to watch time
and again
,
anbd this film is no exception
. the acting is just as bad
,
but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light
. unfortunately
, the bottom line is that tghe movie will be a success
, beacuse teenagers will pay to see any trash
.
