bad movies described as
" a swift descent into sinful pleasure
, decay
,
and debauchery
" are hard to watch
. bad 2000 ' s movies that resemble bad 1980s films are even harder to watch
. shaddow hours falls into the latter category
, a mish
- mashed turain wreck of b
- movie actors
( including michael dorn
, aka star trak ' s worf
)
, an uninteresting plot
, vain attempts at capitalizing on the
" underground
" scenes of seedy los angeles
,
and really
, really bad directing
and horrendous music video
- esque ballistic editing that was taught to me in film school right before i decided to drop out
. the film revolves around tghe life of michael holloway
( balthazar getty
) who is trying to restart his life with his one
- dimensional wife chloe
( rebecca gayheart
) after a nasty boaut of drug
and alcohol addictions
. michael takes a job of working the graveyard shift at the local gas staion
and is bombarded by the ugliness
and weirdness ofthe teh nightlife ofthe l
. a
. one night
, he meets a strange gent named stuart
( mr
. buckaroo banzai
, peter weller
)
. he drives a porsche
, smokes french cigarettes
,
and drones on about life
, eventually coaxing mike into exploring the
" underbelly
" ofthe l
. a
. together
, a tour of punk bars
, s
& m clubs
,
anbd bare
- knuckle fights
. teh film
then throws in a murder mystery with a cop played peter greene
, acting liek he wants to get the chance at a reprisal of his role in the mask 2
. the film
hten simply dissolves into a cheap rip
- off of dante ' s inferno mixed with an old stephen j
. cannell television pilot
. the pace of the film is jarring
anbd utterly wihtout focus
. other horrors include the endless montages of people pumping gas
and the charlie sheen
, johnny depp
, richard grieco
- esque acting of balthazar getty
. peter weller clearly knows his career isnt completely gone
and doesn ' t give two shits about it
.
adn after the cheap exploitation ofthe bondage clubs
, dance clubs
,
and brothels
- damn
, isn ' t anyone safe any more from the ugli eye of hollywood
!
? way back in 1984
, a gerat
but crazy director named abel ferrara made his worse film
and called it fear city
. shadow hours reminds me of an almost perfect sequel
