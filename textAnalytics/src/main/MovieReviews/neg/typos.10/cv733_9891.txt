contrary tothe popular belief
, not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece
. some of them aren ' t even good
. some examples ofthe this priciple are the aboslutely dreadful
" un indien dans la ville
"
( presented as
" little indian
, big city
,
"
and remade into that crap tim allen flick
,
" jungle2jungle
"
)
,
and this
. what could haev been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick
.
" french twist
"
( teh
" cool
" american title
, not the rela one
, which was
" gazon maudit
,
" literally meaning
" twisted ground
,
" or something liuke that
) deals with a married couple with kids
,
and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws thigns up for them
. loli
and alain chabat
( victoria abril
and alain chabat
) are not exactly happily married
. allways on business trips
, alain chabat more than once cheats on her
,
and she eventually finds out
.
and oen day
, she meets a butch mechanic
, marijo
( the co
- writer
/ director josiane balasko
)
,
annd they two kinda hit it off
. so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious
: sleeping with marijo
.
but she soons starts tothe not only fall inwhich love with marijo
,
but she ' s also realizes she ' s still in love with alain chabat
. so
, of course
, she does the obvious from that
: she decides to keep them both
. she ' ll be
(
and sleep
) with each ofthe them for 3 days each
,
hten on sunday
, she ' ll rest by herself
. after all
, she needs it if she ' s gonna have mroe sex than sylvia kristel
. the film goes on for over an hour
and a half
, through stupidity after stupidity
, moronic twist after moronic twist
,
and soon htere ' s the little ironical
(
!
!
!
) ending
. i know it ' s a completly different culture
,
annd i ' m quite familiar with the french
and their cinema
,
but this is just bad
. none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in
" fargo
"
( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point
)
,
and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience
. what ' s shocking is this was not only one of france ' s biggest hits
,
but it was nominated for a lot ofthe cesars
( french equivalent of oscars
)
. the writing
and directing is really the big problem iwth it
. josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role
,
but her little sex comedy isn ' t very humerous
, entertaining
, or even deep at all
. even woody allen ' s not
- very
- good
" a midsummer night ' s sex comedy
" is intelligent
, well
- writen
,
and possesses some depth
. this is shallow
, unfunny
,
and pretty annoying to watch
. the film moves at the pace of a snail
,
and is damn
- near painful to watch
. thank god for the fast forward button
. the acting
,
however
, isn ' t bad at all
. the actors do the best they can with the bad material
,
and victoria abril is pretty likable despite thge scirpt
(
and the fact thgat she ' s stupid enough to try to devide herself over two peopel when she has kids
)
.
and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband
.
bu
" french twist
" is just pretty lame
. it ' s nto overly horrible
,
and has a couple very
, very
, very brief moments
.
but it ' s just a really crap film
,
and an example of an ill
- advised distribution of a foreign film
.
