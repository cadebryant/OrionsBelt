contrary to popular belief
, not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece
. some of them aren
' t even good
. some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful
" un indien dans la ville
"
( presented as
" little indian
, big city
,
"
and remade into that crap tim allen flick
,
" jungle2jungle
"
)
,
and tihs
. what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns inot one mess of a french flick
.
" french twist
"
( the
" cool
" american title
, not the real one
, which wass
" gazon maudit
,
" literally meaninng
" twisted ground
,
" or something like that
) deals with a married couple with kids
,
and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them
. loli anbd alain chabat
( victoria abril
and alain chabat
) are not exactly happily marryied
. always on business trips
, alain chabat more than once cheats on her
,
and she eventually finds out
.
and one day
, she meets a
butch mechanic
, marijo
( the co
- writter
/ director josiane balasko
)
,
and they two kinda hit it off
. so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious
: sleeping with marijo
.
but she soons starts to nto only fall in love with marijo
,
but she
' s also realizes she
' s still in love with alain chabat
. so
, of course
, she does the obvious from that
: she decides to keep them both
. she
' ll be
(
and sleep
) with each ofthe them for 3 days each
,
then on sunday
, she
' ll rest by herself
. after all
, she needs it if she
' s gonna ahve more sex than sylvia kristel
. the film goes on for over an hour
and a half
, through stupidity after stupidity
, moronic twist after moronic twist
,
and soon there
' s the little ironic
(
!
!
!
) ending
. i know it
' s a completely different culture
,
and i
' m quite familliar iwth tjhe french
and their cinema
,
but this is just bad
. none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in
" fargo
"
( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to mkea a point
)
, adn any action they do is pretty much just to git a hopeful chuckle from the audience
. what
' s shocking is thsi was not only one of france
' s biggest hits
,
but it was nominated for a lot of cesars
( french equivalent ofthe oscars
)
. the writing
and directing is really the big problem with it
. josiane balasko doesnt a good acting job with her role
,
but her little sex comedy isn
' t very humerous
, intertaining
, or even deep at all
. even woody allen
' s not
- very
- good
" a midsummer night
' s sex comedy
" is intelligent
, well
- written
,
and posseses some depth
. this is shallow
, unfunny
,
and pretty annoying to watch
. the film moves at thge pace of a snail
,
and is damn
- near painful to watch
. thank god for the fast forward
button
. the acting
,
however
, isn
' t bad at all
. the actors do the best they can with the bad material
,
and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script
(
and the fact thyat she
' s stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people whn she has kids
)
.
and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husb
and
.
but
" french twist
" isnt just pretty lame
. it
' s not overly horrible
,
and has a couple very
, very
, very brief moments
.
but it
' s just a really crap film
,
and an example of an ill
- advised distri
bution of a foreign film
.
