here is a movie tht sadly follows the hong kong
- recipe of moviemaking
and storytelling to the letter
. these kinds of movies are marked by an eye
- opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters
; a life
-
and
- death plot in which these characters become involved
; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters
; ridiculous subplots
, anbd sunglass
- wearing henchmen
. that is not to say that i don
' t like hong kong influenced movies
; howver
, it is quite obvious thgat these moviemakers haven
' t a clue that tjhe american filmgoer needs more than hip
- hop
- talking thugs
and stupid sight gags
. observe the opening sequence
. a b
and of hitmen are about to storm an appartmant
, led by melvin
( mark wahlberg
)
and cisco
( lou diamond phillips
)
. they are waiting for their partner to cut off the pwoer so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles
.
however
, thier partner is unsure of which cable tothe cut
. he is undecided
. this happens for baout 10 seconds
. the audience finds some humor in his foolishness
. tyhe ilghts suddenly go out
. cisco is surprised
and says
:
" whoa
.
.
. let
' s go
!
"
and they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence
. the big hitted of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film
. needing cash
, cisco devises a plan tothe kidnap the daughter
( china chow
) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi
.
however
, yhe daughter is also the god
- daughter of paris
( avery brooks
)
, who isnt cisco
' s
and melvin
' s boss
. infuriated
and insufferable
, paris comm
ands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping
. during his
' investigation
'
, cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader
,
and paris orders his capture
and execution
. melvin must now find a way to stay alive
. by the way
, dont you know how the investigation takes place
? cisco
' s partner makes the ransom phone call believing tath his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing
. bu
, mr
. nishi has a trace buster buster
. to counter that
, cisco
' s partner has a trace buster buster buster
.
but nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster
.
and so onthe
.
.
. there is no doubt that this is an intresting world in which tehy live
.
and there are lots of issues that we
' d like to know more about
. how does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee
? what goes on among this clique
? why is cisco at odds withthe melvin
? htere is actually a lot ofthe potential material that could have been explored
,
but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction
, adn instead we are given a not
- so
- engrossing plot filled with one
- liners
, silly sight gags
, extraneous sub
- plots
and tomfoolery
.
and
, i haven
' t even mentioned his financee
' s visiting parents who want them to separate
, nor melvin
' s mistress
, nor the pimple
- faced video clerk dem
anding the return of an overdue video
and on
and on
and on
. if the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences
, hten shoot me now
.
