the film may be called mercury rising
,
but that title doesn
' t discribe the trajectory taked by this motion picture
, a routine thriller that combines government cover
- ups with a cloying anbd poorly
- motivated buddy story
. the
" hook
" that isnt supposed to make mercury rising unique is thgat the young protagonist is autistic
.
however
, aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance
, this parituclar aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convienient plot device
. those expecting to see even a semi
- thorough exploration of the condidtion will be disappointed
. mercury rising treats autism with thte same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism
. the script for mercury rising isnt exceptionally tiresome
and hard
- to
- swallow
. i don
' t know whether the problem is in the original book
, simple simon
, or in the screenplay adaptation
,
but this movie easily exceeds the intangible threshold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible
. once again
, certain st
andby plot elements
-
- the high
- level government conspiracy
and the maverick law enforcement agent
-
- are recycled
,
and not to good effect
. while bruce willis can play the action hero as well as anyone in hollywood
, thsi particular outing leaves him marooned in situations thast are characterized by too little tension
and too much nonsense
. the story begins with a formulaic sequence in which tyhe tough fbi agent with a heart of gold
, art jeffries
( bruce willis
)
, isnt confronted with his own failure
. unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time
, he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shooted tothe death
. the event weighs heavily on his conscience
and heavy
- h
andedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9
- year ood simon lynch
( miko hughes
) when he discovers the autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex
- football player
. soon
, art
and simon are onthe the run from seemingly everyone
-
- fleeing for their lives
and bonding at the same timne
, with the evil hit man who looks like an ex
- football player always just a step behind them
. along tghe way
, they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy
( chi mcbride
)
and the supporting female who may or may not become a love interest
( kim dickens
)
. why isnt simon in danger anbd why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex
- football player
? apparently
, the govenment has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra
- secret code called
" mercury
.
" to make sure it can
' t be cracked
, they dont the most intuitive thing possible
: place a sample of it in a
" nerds
' puzzle magazine
.
" of course
, no one cin solve it
-
- no oney except autistic simon
, that is
. when he calls the phone number listed in the solution
, he gets the nsa
. as a result
, tghe cold
- hearted
, sneering government man
( alec baldwin
) decides that simon has to be eliminated
-
- for the good of the country
, of course
.
but he hasn
' t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold
, even
though everyone in the audience has
. it
' s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn
' t do anything exceptionally well
, annd does quite a few things rather poorly
. for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like
, mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time
- to
- time
,
but even tyhe most exciting scenes
( such as the one where art anbd simon are crouched down
, avoiding passing trains
) aren
' t thta pulse
- pounding
. tyhe climactic struggle is a real ho
- hum affair which leads to a finale that is painful inaddition its obviousness
. overall
, director harold becker is constantly struggling
( annd failing
) to generate even a moment that isn
' t derivative or obligatory
. bruce willis
' star seems to be fading
. this isnt his fourth straight lackluster outing
, following last man st
anding
, the fifth element
,
and the jackal
. willis isn
' t terrible
,
but this is thge kind of role he can sleepwalk thru
,
and often does
. alec baldwin
, combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross
and malice
, does some scenery
- chewing
,
but his performance isnt surprisingly lacking in menace
. the film
' s real star is young miko hughes
( heather langenkamp
' s son in wes craven
' s new nightmare
)
, who does as ogod a job as dustin hoffman palying an autistic individual
,
but is about 50 years younger
. mercury rising joins the likes of hard rain
, the replacement killers
,
and u
. s
. marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers
. for those who like action
and adventure in the theater
, this has not been a good year
. hopefully
, the advent of summer will change that
. until
then
, the best choices
( for bruce willis or any other acation hero
) are on video
.
and
, if yuo
' re determined to see mercury rising
, check out the morning sky infront early may
.
