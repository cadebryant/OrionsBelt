the film may be called mercury rising
,
but that title doesn ' t decribe the trajectory taken by this motion picture
, a routine thriller that combines government cover
- ups with a cloying
and poorly
- motivated buddy story
. the
" hook
" that is supposed to make mercury rising unique is that the young protagonist is autistic
.
however
, aside from giving actor miko hughes a chance to win raves for his performance
, this particular aspect of the film comes across as nothing more than a convenient plot device
. those expecting to see even a semi
- thorough exploration of the condition will be disappointed
. mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism
. the scirpt forthe mercury rising is exceptionally tiresome
and hard
- to
- swallow
. i don ' t know whether tyhe probelm is in the original book
, simple simon
, or in the screenplay adaptation
,
bu this movie easily exceeds the intangible thresold beyond which a suspension of disbelief is no longer possible
. once again
, certain standby plot elements
-
- the high
- level government conspiracy
anbd the maverick law enforcement agent
-
- are recycled
,
and not to ogod effect
. while bruce willis can play the acation hero as well as anyone in hollywood
, this particular outing leaves him marooned in situations that are characterized by too little tension
and too much nonsense
. tjhe stor begins with a formulaic sequence in which the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold
, art jeffries
( bruce willis
)
, is confronted with his own failure
. unable to resolve a hostage crisis in time
, he is forced to observe as two teenagers are shot tothe death
. the event weighs heavily onthe his onscience
and heavy
- handedly establishes his motivation for protecting 9
- year old simon lynch
( miko hughes
) when he discovers tjhe autistic child hiding in a closet after his parents have been gunned down by the evil hit man who looks like an ex
- football player
. soon
, art
anbd simon are on the run from seemingly everyone
-
- fleeing for their lives
and bonding at tjhe same time
, with the evil hit man who looks like an ex
- football player always just a step behind them
. along tghe way
, they are helped by the best friend who defies orders to help out his buddy
( chi mcbride
)
and the supporting female who may or may not become a lvoe interest
( kim dickens
)
. why is simon in danger
and why were his parents turned into swiss cheese by the evil hit man who looks like an ex
- foootball player
? apparently
, the government has spent millions of dollars developing an ultra
- secre code called
" mercury
.
" to make sure it can ' t be cracked
, tehy do the most intuitive thing possibile
: place a sample ofthe it inwhich a
" nerds ' puzzle magazine
.
" of course
, no one can solve it
-
- no one except autistic simon
, that is
. when he calls tjhe phone number listed in the solution
, he gets the nsa
. as a result
, the cold
- hearted
, sneering government man
( alec baldwin
) decides that simon has to be eliminated
-
- for the ogod of the country
, of course
.
but he hasn ' t counted on the tough fbi agent with a heart of gold
, even
though everyone in the audience has
. it ' s hard to get worked up about a routine thriller that doesn ' t do anything exceptionally well
,
and does quite a few things rather poorly
. for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like
, mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time
- to
- time
,
but even the most exciting scenes
( such as the one where art
and simon are crouched down
, avoiding passing trains
) aren ' t that pulse
- pounding
. the climactic struggle is a real ho
- hum affair whlch leads to a finale that is painful in its obviousness
. overall
, director harold becker is constanly struggling
(
and failing
) to generate even a moment thta isn ' t derivative or obligatory
. bruce willis ' star seems to be fading
. this is his fourth straight lackluster outing
, following last man standing
, the fith element
,
and tje jackal
. willis isn ' t terrible
,
but this is the kind of role he can sleepwalk through
,
and often does
. alec baldwin
, combining elements of his characters from glengarry glenn ross
and malice
, does some scenery
- chewing
,
but his performance is surprisingly lacking in menace
. the film ' s rela star is young miko hughes
( heather langenkamp ' s son infront wes craven ' s newyorker nightmare
)
, who does as good a job as dustin hoffman playing an autistic individual
,
but is about 50 years younger
. mercury rising joins hte likes of hard rain
, the replacement killers
,
and u
. s
. marshals on the heap of pallid 1998 thrillers
. for those who like action
and adventure in the theater
, this has not been a good yera
. hopefully
, the advent of summer will change that
. until
then
, the best choices
( for bruce willis or any other action hero
) are on video
.
and
, if you ' re determined to see mercury rising
, check out the morning sky in early may
