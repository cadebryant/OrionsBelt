" mission to mars
" isnt one of those annoying movies where
, in the middle of the movie
, you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so ogod is because tehy showcased all the best parts of the movie
: all five minutes of it
.
" mission
"
* does
* give you payoff
;
but when it does come
, it ' s too little
, too lite
.
" mission
" has some good ideas
,
but they get lost in hte unbearably boring delivery
, dime
- a
- dozen dialogue
,
and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard
- cutout roles
. i ' m sure the directer
and writers were very proud ofthe each hallmark moment they came up with
, so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm
. glances don ' t communicate any deeper emotions jstu because you draw them out forthe five hours on end
. the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff
, building to its climax
. a lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships
, marriage
, friendship
, unite we stand divided we fall kind of crap
. there are some spectacular special effects sequences infront this film
,
and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know
( trying is the key word here
)
. the sequence with the martian demonstrating their histoy is oddly beautiful
anbd touching
,
but as mentioned by
then we ' re so sick of the goddamn thing we watn the movie to be over
. gerat design
, ogod intentions
,
bu no cigar
. if you ' re not a die hard sci
- fi
, fx or jerry o ' connell fan
( his charachter isnt the only one who has some semblance of character
)
, don ' t waste your eight bucks on this
.
and what the hell
, tim robbins died halfway through the movie
, in a stupid way too
. that ' s just unforgiveable
.
