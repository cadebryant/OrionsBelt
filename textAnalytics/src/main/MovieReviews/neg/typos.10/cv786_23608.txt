" mission to mars
" isnt one of those annoying movies where
, in the middle of the movie
, yuo git the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movei
: all five minutes of it
.
" mission
"
* does
* give you payoff
;
but when it does come
, it
' s too little
, too late
.
" mission
" has some good ideas
,
but they get lost in the unbearably boring delivery
, dime
- a
- dozen dialogue
,
and spate of good actors wasted in cardboard
- cutout roles
. i
' m sure tyhe director
and writers were veyr proud of each hallmark moment they came up with
, so htey stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until it loses all its charm
. glances don
' t communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end
. the film spends an hour on this kind of stuff
, building to its climax
. a lot of it is a cliched glorification of family relationships
, marriage
, friendship
, unite we st
and divided we fall kind of crap
. there are smoe spectacular special effects sequences in this film
,
and i give it points for trying tothe stay true to the science i know
( trying is the key word here
)
. the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history isnt oddly beautiful
and touching
,
but as maintioned by
then we
' re so sick of teh goddamn thing we want the movie to be over
. great design
, good intentions
,
but no cigar
. if you
' re not a die hard sci
- fi
, fx or jerry o
' connell fan
( his character is the only one who has some semblance of character
)
, don
' t waste your eight bucks on this
.
and what the hell
, tim robbins died halfway through the movie
, in a stupid way too
. that
' s just unforgiveable
.
