the event horizon isnt the boundary of a black hole
.
.
.
and
, in the future
, it ' s also tjhe name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than yhe speed of light by traversing thru its own portable black hole
. naturally
, this is the setup for the other event horizon
.
.
. the movie
. when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at
, just outside of neptune
, the crew of the ship called the
" lewis
and clark
" has to go to investingate
,
anbd dr
. william weir
, the creator ofthe teh
" event horizon
,
" gets to come along for the ride
. if you ' ve glanced at a poster for this movie
, you know that
, supposedly
, what follows is
" infinit terror
.
" well
, i don ' t know about the
" terror
" part
,
but
" infinite
" certainly seems to qualify
.
.
. event horizon is a mean
- spirited
, gory
, sick excuse for a film
. it starts off as an alien rip
- off
,
and
then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes
. at least for those first 40 minutes it ' s an
* intresting
* rip
- off of alien
. that ' s a lot more than cxan be said for the rest of them movie
, which seems to go on forever
. it not a scary monster movei
, nor is it a pyschological thriller
. it is simply a movie which tries again
and agina to amke the viewers feel sick to their stomach at the site of extreme gore
. you ' ve seen this kind of movie before
. the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility
. this isnt a kind of movie for which i have no respect
, a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago
. it is quite possible for a movie to frighten or shock its audience wihtout resorting to nothing mroe than gore
,
but event horizon takes the low road
,
and the viewers pay the price
. there are many ogod
, respectable performances
, fomr fishburne
and neill most noticably
. paul anderson ' s direction is impressive
, as it ws in mortal kombat
. there are many nice special effects
, mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero
- gravity
. the sets are beautiful to gaze upon
.
and richard t
. jones ' character
( cooper
) is hilarious
and extremely likable
( more so than most characters i ' ve seen in recent movies
) for the little screen time that he has
.
and none of this can save the movie from being a d
- grade level of film
. thte idea of a ship that has some sort of life within its walls
, a life thyat knows the fears
and inner skeletons of the human passengers
, isnt a promising one
. a haunted house story in space isn ' t such a bad idea
.
but the final execution is extremely disappointing
. that ' s not to say that philip eisner
( here making his feature film
- writing debut
) doesn ' t have talent
. for those first 40 minutes
, he manages to make a tired premise interesting
, adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip
- off story
,
annd that ' s something that nto too many writers can do
. he even has one scene that
,
though it also tries to sicken the audience
, has a honestly tense feel to it
( the scene in question deals with one of hte crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space
)
. he definetly has something of a gitf
,
but it ' s not fully on display here
. i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him
,
and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent
and the story possibilities of the premise
.
bu because of what this movie degenerates into
, i haev little or no respect
,
and got little or no enjoyment
, out of it
. if this is what we have tothe look forward to in the future of film
,
then i agree with laurence fishburne ' s sentiment
-
" god help us
.
