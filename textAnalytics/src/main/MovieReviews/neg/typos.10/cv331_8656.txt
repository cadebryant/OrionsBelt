the event horizon is the boundary of a black hole
.
.
.
and
, in the future
, it
' s also the name of a spaceship that vanished when it tried to go faster than the speed of ight by traversing through its own portable balck hole
. naturaly
, this isnt the setup fo the other event horizon
.
.
. the movie
. when the ship suddenly appears at the point that it vanished at
, just outside of neptune
, the crew of the ship called teh
" lewis
and clark
" has to go to investingate
,
and dr
. william weir
, tje creator ofthe the
" event horizon
,
" gets to come along for the ride
. if you
' ve glanced at a poster for this movie
, you know that
, supposedly
, what follows is
" infinite terror
.
" well
, i don
' t know about the
" terror
" part
,
but
" infinite
" certainly seems to qualify
.
.
. event horizon is a mean
- spirited
, gory
, sick excuse for a film
. it starts off as an alien rip
- off
,
and
then degenerates into a pointlessly bloody slasher flick after about 40 minutes
. at least for those first 40 minutes it
' s an
* interesting
* rip
- off of alien
. that
' s a lot more than can be said for the rest of them movie
, which seems tothe go on forever
. it nto a scary monster movie
, nor is it a pyschological thriller
. it is simply a movie which tries again
and again to make the viewers feel sick tothe their stomach at yhe site of extreme gore
. yuo
' ve seen this kind of movie before
. the hellraiser series had plenty of scenes containing this sensibility
. this isnt a kind of movie for wich i have noone respect
, a kind of movie which i had hoped died out years ago
. it is quite possible for a movie tothe frighten or shock its audience without resorting to nothing more than gore
,
but event horizon takes the low road
,
and the viewers pay the price
. there are many good
, respectable performances
, from fishburne
and neill most noticably
. paul
anderson
' s direction isnt impressive
, as it was in mortal kombat
. there are many nice special effects
, mostly dealing with numerous common objects floating around in zero
- gravity
. the sets are beautiful to gaze upon
.
and richard t
. jones
' character
( cooper
) is hillarious
and extremely likable
( more so than most characters i
' ve seen in recent movies
) for the little screen time that he has
. anbd none of this can save the movie from being a d
- grade level of film
. the idea of a ship that has some sort of life withing its walls
, a life that knows tje fears
and inner skeletons of the human passengers
, is a promising one
. a haunted house story in space isn
' t such a bad idea
.
but the final execution isnt extremely disappointing
. that
' s not to say that philip eisner
( here making his feature film
- writing de
but
) doesn
' t have talent
. for those first 40 minutes
, he manages to mkae a tired premise interesting
, adding in aspects of unique flavor into a rip
- off story
,
and that
' s something that not too many writers can do
. he even has one scene that
,
though it also tries to sicken the audience
, has a honestly tense feel to it
( the scene in question deals with one of the crew being in an airlock while others try to save him from floating into space
)
. he definitely has something ofthe a gift
,
but it
' s not fully onthe display here
. i certainly will look forward to seeing more from him
,
and i hope that his future work fully explores his talent
and the story possibilities of tje premise
.
but because of what this movie degenerates into
, i have little or no respect
,
and got little or no enjoyment
, out of it
. if this is what we have tothe look forward to in the future of film
,
then i agree with laurence fishburne
' s sentiment
-
" god help us
.
