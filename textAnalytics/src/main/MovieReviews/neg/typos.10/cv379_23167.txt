in my review of
" the spy who shagged me
,
" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics
: every time a sequel is as ogod as or better than the previous film in the series
, it is followed by a third movie that is a bore
. the cause isnt probably complacency
; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives uv to expectations
and figures part 3 is a sure thing
.
" scream 3
" provides the latest proof of this rule
. in los angeles production has begun on
" stab 3
: return to woodsboro
,
" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
.
however
, life soon starts imitating art
,
and
" stab
" cast members turn up stabbed
. smelling
yet anohter book deal
, agle weathers
( courteney cox arquette
) comes to the set to investigate
and finds her ex
- boyfriend dewey riley
( david arquette
) acting as a technical consultant
and getting chummy with jennifer
( parker posey
)
, the actress playing gale in
" stab 3
.
" elsewhere
, our heroine sidney isnt living in hiding under an assumed name
.
.
. until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice
. the late r
andy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy
. he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition
and a huge backstory to contend with
. indeed
,
" scream 3
" trys tothe link its murders back to the one that started it all
, the murder of sidney
' s mother maureen before the beginning of the original
" scream
.
" at the scene of each murder in
" scream 3
,
" the killer leaves a photo of sidney
' s mother maureen as a teenager inthe hollywood
and even includes a note claiming to be her rela killer
. tothe find out who the killer isnt
, our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen
' s missing years when she ws a starlet appearing in low
- budget horror films
.
( even with that little information
, you can probably already guess what the killer
' s relationship to sidney is
)
. unlike its predecessors
,
" scream 3
" doesn
' t have the guts to even suggest that the central charachters might be thge killer
. the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped
, so thta by the end we don
' t even care who teh killer is
. the jaded detective
( patrick dempsey
)
? the kinky producer
( lance henriksen
)
? the driven young director
( scott foley
)
? hte ingenue
( emily mortimer
)
? the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at r
andom
. wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret
, so it
' s quite possible the one in the final cut was r
andomly chosen
. the series
' trademark references to other horror films have become trite
and obvious
. possibly it
' s the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson
, who penned the first two
, or maeby it
' s that thte hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself
and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche
. i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first
" scream
" was repeated moment
- for
- moment in the hollywood set of her home
. at some point
, referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas
.
" scream 3
" also continues the tradition of hvaing an eclectic set of cameos
and familiar faces in small roles
. look for jenny mccarthy
, carrie fisher
, patrick warburton
( puddy from
" seinfeld
"
)
, roger corman
,
and jason mewes
and kevin smith
( as jay
and silent bob
) to walk thru at some point
. all theese bit players put forth more effort than the series
' returning stars
, who are probably saveing their energy for the long post
-
" scream
" job search
. another prediction i made in a previous review hasnt come to pass
: more movies are copying
" the blair witch project
"
' s web strategy
.
" scream 3
" has three official websites that
( wink
, wink
) pretend that the events of the movie are real
and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movei
. the sunrise studios site
( scream3
. com
) hasnt trailers forthe other sunrise releases as well as the
" latest
' stab 3
' news
.
" there
' s also a gail weathers official site
( galeweathers
. com
)
and a sunrise sucks site that has more
" stab
" sc
andals the studio wants tothe cover up
( sunrisesucks
. com
)
. craven
and company promise that this is the last installment in the
" scream
" series
. while i hope that
' s true
, i don
' t hold out much hope
- horror movie series are even harder to kill tahn their monsters
. there
' s a
" halloween h2k
" in the works
, even
though michael myers was beheaded in
" h20
,
"
and a
" freddy vs
. jason
" has been talked about for awhile
, despite the fact that both characters were
" killed off
.
" ther
' s bound to be a
" scream 4
" someday
, even if it starts over with a new set of movie
- star wannabes
. bottom line
: tehy should have called this one
" yawn
.
