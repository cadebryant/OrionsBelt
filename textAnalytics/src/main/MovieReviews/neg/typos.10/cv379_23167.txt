inaddition my review of
" the spy who shagged me
,
" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics
: every time a sequal is as good as or better thna the previous film in the series
, it is followed by a third movie thgat is a bore
. the cause is probablly complacency
; a studio sighs wtih relief when part 2 lives up to expectations
and figures part 3 is a sure thing
.
" scream 3
" provides the latest proof of thsi rule
. in los angeles prodcution has begun on
" stab 3
: return to woodsboro
,
" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
.
however
, life soon starts imitating art
,
and
" stab
" casted members turn up stabbed
. smelling
yet another book deel
, gale weathers
( courteney cox arquette
) comes to thte set to investigate
and finds her ex
- boyfriend dewey riley
( david arquette
) acting as a technical consultant
adn getting chummy with jennifer
( parker posey
)
, the actress playing agle in
" stab 3
.
" elsewhere
, our heroine sidney isnt living in hiding under an assumed name
.
.
. until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice
. the late randy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) makes a surprise guest appearance via video tothe explain the rules of a trilogy
. he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition
and a huge backstory to contend wih
. indeed
,
" scream 3
" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all
, the murder of sidney ' s mother maureen befoer tyhe beginning of the original
" scream
.
" at the scene of each murder infact
" scream 3
,
" the killer leaves a photo of sidney ' s mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood
and even includes a note claiming tothe be her real killer
. to find out who the killer is
, our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happend during maureen ' s missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low
- budget horror films
.
( even with that littel information
, you can probably already guess what the killer ' s relationship to sidney is
)
. unlike its predecessors
,
" scream 3
" doesn ' t have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer
. the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped
, so that by the end we don ' t even care who the killer is
. the jaded detective
( patrick dempsey
)
? the kinky producer
( lance henriksen
)
? the driven young directer
( scott foley
)
? the ingenue
( emily mortimer
)
? the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random
. wes craven supposedly filmed threee different endings to keep the real one a secret
, so it ' s quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly choosen
. the series ' trademark references to otehr horror films have become trite
and obvious
. possibly it ' s the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson
, who penned the first twpo
, or maybe it ' s that the hip ironic stance evenhtually consumes itself
and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche
. i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first
" scream
" was repeated moment
- for
- moment in the hollywood set of her home
. at smoe point
, referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new idesa
.
" scream 3
" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set ofthe cameos
and familiar faces in small roles
. look forthe jenny mccarthy
, carrie fisher
, patrick warburton
( puddy from
" seinfeld
"
)
, roger corman
,
and jason mewes
and kevin smith
( as jay
and silent bob
) to walk through at some point
. all these bit players put forth more effort than the series ' returning stars
, who are probably saving their energy for yhe long post
-
" scream
" job search
. another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass
: more movies are copying
" the blair witch project
" ' s web strategy
.
" scream 3
" has three official websites that
( wink
, wink
) pretend that the events of the movie are real
annd provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie
. the sunrise studios site
( scream3
. com
) has trailers for other sunrise releses as well as the
" latest ' stab 3 ' news
.
" there ' s also a gail weathers official site
( galeweathers
. com
)
and a sunrise sucks site thta has more
" stab
" scandals tyhe studio wants to cover up
( sunrisesucks
. com
)
. craven
and company promise that this is the last installment in the
" scream
" series
. while i hope tht ' s true
, i don ' t hold out much hope
- horror movie series are even harder tothe kill than their monsters
. ther ' s a
" halloween h2k
" in the works
, even
though michael myers was beheaded in
" h20
,
"
and a
" freddy vs
. jason
" has beeen talked about for awhile
, despite the fact that both characters were
" killed off
.
" there ' s bound to be a
" scream 4
" someday
, even if it starts over withthe a new set ofthe movie
- star wannabes
. bottom line
: they shoudln have called this one
" yawn
.
