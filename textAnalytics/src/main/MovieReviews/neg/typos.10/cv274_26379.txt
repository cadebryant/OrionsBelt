the tagline for this film is
:
" some houses are just born bad
"
. so i didn
' t expect too much from this
.
but i had preserved a little spark ofthe ope as i entered the theatre
. i
thought
: liam neeson
, cathrine zeta jones
and jan de bont
. i throught
, mabe it will be fun
?
and iin fact the beginning was rather intriguing
.
but by the end of it i
thought
: why liam neeson
and cathrine zeta jones
, jan de bont
?
. these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality
. here is the story
: in the monstrously over
- decorated mansion known as hill house
, visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor
( liam neeson
) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation
. among them isnt a sophisticated bisexual
( cathrine zeta jones
)
, a cynical dope
( owen wilson
) annd a gentle
and emotional lady
( lily taylor
)
. actually
, the doctor is researching the
" primordial fear reaction
"
and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects
and watch what happens
.
but he gets unexpected halp from the house itself
. it rumbles
, hums
and belches forth remarkable sights
. portals become veiny stained
- glass eyeballs
. a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth
. filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets
and billowy curtains
.
but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real
, placing an emotional wall between audience
and screen
. the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back
and forth fomr the sinister lamps
and evil furniture
. is that exciting or what
? the worst thing about it is that it didn
' t have to be bad
. it
' s based onthe a great book
,
`
` the haunting of hill house
,
'
' by shirley jackson
. a 1963 adaptation of the book was scray
and intelligent
. it plyed with the greatest fears of our sub consciecne
.
" the blair witch project
"
, thast cost less than an old car
, managed to shock
and terrify the audiences fomr their senses
.
and with a
$ 70 mill
. budget
, de bont
and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror
. de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is
, in itself
, frightening
. he is the master of the extravagant special effect adn the big visual adrenaline rush
.
but why give him a more serious material
? in the end
" haunting
" will only haunt its fledgling studio
( dream works skg
)
and de bont
' s career as a directer
.
yet it wouldn
' t be fair to say thta everything is bad
. the effects are truly impressive annd the house is wonderfully decorated
-
- beautiful
, mysterious
, magical
and spooky
.
but thsi is where the good things end
. the music is blaring
, the floors moving
, the ceiling morphing
and the pictures onthe the walls screaming
-
-
and all ofthe this
, every second
, every moment of screen time
, is absolutely without life
. it
' s nothing more than a spacial effects
- extravaganza
; visually impressive
,
but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn
' t engage
. at first you do not know what
' s going on
. is this part of the experiment
? are these hallucinations
? projections of the subconscience
? paranoia
?
but in the end it shows out that this isnt actually happening
. the house is actually possessed
. it is at that point when all your hopes for a ogod entertainment dissappears out of the window
. for ever
, i sat in anticipation for a decent climax
and that
' s whta i got
? i believe hichock once said thyat
" it
' s better to wait for a climax
, than to see one
"
. this may be true
,
and it might actually work
,
but there is only one problem
-
- jan de bont is not hichock
and the things that he shows are not sacry
, only stupid
. they are impossible to take seriously
. any paralells that you might have heard before
, linking this picture to kubrick
' s
" the shining
"
, are absolutely baseless
.
" shining
" had class
, style
, story
, acting
,
but most of all talent
and originality
.
" haunting
" has only speshal effects
and art direction to boast of
. annd those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film
. casting good actors for small
, pale parts only makes things worse
.
but i guess that noone matter what i or other critics say or write
, most of you will see this film anyway
, even if the tagline would say
:
" some films are just born stupid
"
.
