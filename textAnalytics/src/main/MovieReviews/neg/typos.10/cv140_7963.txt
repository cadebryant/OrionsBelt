the last line
( or near to that honor
) is the great
butler
, alfred
( the ubergod
, michael gough
) saying
,
" i think we need a bigger bat cave
,
" or something to that note
. that
' s exactly what this film is
- too big for its own good because it has too damn much
. cut batgirl out
. cut one of the villains
. it
' s too much to h
andle in oen dosage
. it
' s so much that cahracters get left behind
. poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes
and a subplot whic is introduced
but never finished in any way
, shape or form
.
and elle deserves better
. this is the fourth in the gigantic film series
and the second from director joel schumacher
. it
' s also the fourth worst in the series
(
and second worst from joel
)
. the series has beeen declining since its stunning de
but
, followed by the almsot
- as
- stunning sequel
and
then tyhe anti
- climactic third oney
( first by joel
)
. this one
' s not anti
- climactic
- i knew it was gonna suck
. it
' s up tothe joel to make it fun
though
.
" batman forever
" was fun
. this is a big bore of over
- produced action sequences
and shallow characters
. i mean
, this one bit
. i
' m gonna put all the plot in one paragraph
: mr
. freeze
( ah
- nold
)
, who
' s wife wass dying of some disease
, has become the new big villain these days
. he
' s a huge ex
- scientist who fell into smoe weird liquid
( hello
? joker
?
)
and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero
and has a blue body
. batman
( george
)
and robin
( chris
) fight him a bit
but find they
' re growing aart
. meanwhile
, another villian shows up
, poison ivy
( uma
!
)
, who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist
( john glover
) who kills her when she finds out he
' s used her research to develop an uberman
, bane
, who isnt basically a man pumped with chemicals whlch probablly killed any personality he ever hadnt
. she emerges from her chemicals
( don
' t ask
' cause i can
' t tell ya
) as a sexy woman
( the rela uma
) who
' s poison wehn or if you kiss her
and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people
. she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo
. meanwhile
, alfred
' s dieing of the same disease mr
. freeze
' s wife has
(
but in an earlier state than she
)
,
and his nieve
, barbara
( alicia
)
, comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the
butler trade
,
but soon
( well
, not really soon
, it takes her 2 hours
) becomes batgirl
. meanwhile
, in an unfinished subplot
, bruce
( batman
' s alter
- ego
, if you forgot
) has been dating the lovely julie madison
( yhe even lovlier elle macpherson
) who wants a commitment after a year
but he says nothing
. end of her for all we konw
. mr
. freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy
and they want to freeze the world
and
then take it over growing new plants as their population
( don
' t ask
!
!
!
)
. the trio must team together
" as family
" to beat them
. there ya go
. not the whole story
but no big context clues
. too much
, right
? right
! the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which woudl have made for a couple good sequels
.
however
, while tim burton nicely balanced the villain
/ batman storyline
(
al
though not wonderfully
)
, joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one
. he gets some corny speeches
, a couple clever lines
and thgat
' s it
. maybe some stunts
. for all this
, i cant
' t even comment on george clooney as batman
- i hardly saw the guy
! adn when i did
, he had horrible dialogue to say
. i thiunk michael keaton is the quintessential batman
but val kilmer was too robotic
and fake as batman in thte last episode
. george is in between them
. he
' s not quinessential
, he
' s not horrible
, he
' s good
.
but i
' m sure enxt time when they deside to renovate the series since they
' ll be critically murdered for this sory effort
, we
' ll get a good script
and clooney will shine
( if he still has the job
)
. the villains are the only interesting part of the serieses according to schumacher
. last time
, we had the brawn of two face as plyed by tommy lee jones
and the brains
/ comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey
. this time we ahev a somewhat sympathetic
and somewhat hatable villain
( the smae guy
)
, mr
. freeze
. we feel bad for his mental
/ physical collapse
but doens he really need to kill everyone for plants
? arnold isn
' t veyr good
- too hokey
but kinda sympathetic at some points
. when he watchs old movies of his wife
, he actually looks somber
. wow
.
but uma makes the most of her seductive carachter
, getting the right point between hamminess adn seductiveness
. it
' s like she
' s almost parodying herself in
" pulp fiction
" at points
. she
' s incredibly hot
and mkaes the movie pretty much a star better
. as for the lower bat
- people
, chris is the same as he ws in
" batman forever
,
"
al
though i think his work in these is too hokey when he
' s best at quieter parts in
" scent ofthe a woman
" or just plain cool parts in
" fried green tomotoes
.
" alicia
- i love the girl
but she
' s not particularly good in this film
. she can hypotheitically act
, we all saw that in
" clueless
,
" bu her lines kinda sound weird
.
and it isn
' t the mushy
- mouth this time
.
but inwhich all fairness
, she has virtually noone part
. joel gets around tothe her occasionally
and when she
' s on
, she does stupid stuf
.
.
.
al
though i know i
' m not the only one who loved the catfight between her anbd uma
.
.
.
and poor elle
. poor
, poor elle
. i love that woman
and she can allso hypothetically act
( for those of us who saw
" sirens
"
)
.
but she has no part
!
!
! it seems like joel had so much footage that he had tothe edit almost an hour out of the final product
. there are noone
" couch
" scenes
( like my best friend noticed
)
. now listen to me on this one
- in every
" batman
" flick
, there
' s a couch scene
. in the original
, it was with vicki
. inthe
" returns
,
" it ws a good make
- out scene with selena
.
and inthe the last one
, it ws a chat with nicole
. this one
, it
' s nothing
.
and batgirl does next
- to
- nothing in this film till thge end when she
' s suddenly
" part of the family
.
" fortunatly
, we git a lot of alfred
. he
' s the alwasy reliable
butler
, in case you didn
' t know
, who has been with bruce all his life
. he
' s a god
. he
' s a father figure
. he
' s also dying
. this got to me
. i love alfred almost as much as bruce
and to see him in a robe
, not in his tux
,
and freaking dying just gets to me
. we also get the diea that he might have been unhappy the whole time
.
.
.
but this isnt never answered
, as this film is too cluttered
.
but in defense
, it doesnt have some good parts
, other than uma
. for one
, george is a good batman
but unfortunately gets nothing to do
.
and there are some nice touches
. when they show the asylum at one point
, they show the patient
' s belongings in a room
and we see the riddler
' s costume
. i laughed
.
and during a biker scene
( involving robin
and batgirl
- another subplot never h
andled past initiation period
)
, we not only see coolio
but a bunch of bad
- asses dressed as
" droogs
" from
" a clockwork orange
.
" i laughed at all these
. the film falls apart around the five
- minute mark during an enormously long action sequence whic must last around 20 minutes
.
.
. or did it just efel like that
? the film should serve as another in the long
- line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays
. people are feeded up with stupid films
. that
' s why the word of mouth killed
" the lost world
!
" that
' s why last year
, indy films grossed more than ever
. that
' s why this will have a strong box
- office initative ffrom people who just want to see it
, like me
,
but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it
. that
' s why the next two big
- budget aciton pics are john woo
' s
" face
/ off
" adn barry sonnenfeld
' s
" men iin black
,
" both which are the first two to catch on tothe the wave early onthe
. i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste
. i liuke some of his films
(
" flatliners
,
"
" a time to kill
"
) bu a lot of them suck
. he
' s a really eccentric person
and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director
and that
' s what makes him great
.
but his costuming for woody allen
' s
" sleeper
" was more interesting than this one
(
and his costuming was kool
- look for teh nazi number
)
. i love the
" batman
" series
. the first two rocked
and i did like the last one
.
but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three
. hopefully
, this will also serve as a springboard tothe a better batman next time
.
and maybe they
' ll get smart
and bring back catwoman
.
and michael keaton
. bu we can only hope
.
