ah
,
anbd 1999 was going along so well
, too
.
" she ' s all taht
" has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i ' ve seen so far this year
.
and quite frankly
, i dout i ' ll see anything equally bad
.
( at least
, i
* hope
* i don ' t see anything equally bad
)
.
" she ' s all that
" tells the story of the most populare guy in school
( played by freddie prinze jr
.
) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school
( rachel leigh cook
) into the most popular
. that
, right there
, is problem
# 1
. how many times have we seen this storyline
? as cook comments near the end of the film
,
" it ' s kind of liuke
" pretty woman
"
, except without the prostitution
"
. of course
, had the filmmakers attempted tothe try something new with this material
, thte well
- worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward
. as it is
,
though
,
" she ' s all that
" relies
* completely
* on the lame
and overused formula to push it ahead
. there ' s not one original or interesting carachter in the film
, either
,
and if thgat wasn ' t bad enough
, there ' s nto one good performance featured
. the star ofthe the movei
, rachel leigh cook
, is simpley horrible
. i usually don ' t like to get so personal
,
but in this case
, i think it needs to be said
. cook wears yhe same expression throughout the flick
and looks tothe be having as miserable a time as i was
. i was never convinced that she was a
" nerd
"
,
and her transformation was unconvincing
and unnecessary
. the movei seems to be saying it ' s better to be popular than tothe be who you are
. as for freddie prinze jr
.
, an actor i ordinarily enjoy
, he too is quite bad here
. he coasts through tjhe film on so
- called charm
,
and never estabishes a real character
. kieren culkin is here
, too
, as the brother ofthe cook
.
and for some indiscernable reason
, he ' s got hearing aids
. no explanation is given
and they ' re never brought up
. were we supposed to feel
* sorry
* fo him just because he wore hearing aids
? i don ' t think so
. that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i ' ve seen in a movie in a long time
.
" she ' s all that
" sucks
. that ' s what it boils down to
. it ' s not entertaining
,
and it ' s not even a good time passer
. the hour
and a half running timne goes by slower than a 5 minute hair
- removal system informercial
.
and what ' s worse
, it sends outloud a bad message to teens
. it appears to be telling them
,
" hey
, it doesn ' t matter if you ' re happy the way you are
. that ' s unimportant
. if you want to
* truly
* be happy
, dress in the latest fashions
and act liuke a bubble
- headed moron
.
" ugh
.
