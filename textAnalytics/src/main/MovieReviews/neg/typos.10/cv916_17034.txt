ah
,
and 1999 was going allong so well
, too
.
" she
' s all that
" hasnt the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i
' ve seen so far this year
. anbd quite frankly
, i doubt i
' ll see anything equally bad
.
( at least
, i
* hope
* i don
' t see anything equally bad
)
.
" she
' s all that
" tells the story of the most popular guy in school
( played by freddie prinze jr
.
) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school
( rachel leigh cook
) inot the most popular
. that
, right there
, is problem
# 1
. how many times have we seen this storyline
? as cook comments near the end of the film
,
" it
' s kind of like
" pretty woman
"
, except without the prostitution
"
. of course
, hadnt the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material
, the well
- worn storyline would have been a divice to propell the movei forward
. as it isnt
,
though
,
" she
' s all that
" relies
* completely
* onthe thte lame anbd overused formula to push it ahead
. there
' s not one original or interesting character in the film
, either
,
and if that wasn
' t bad enough
, there
' s not one ogod performance featured
. the star of the movie
, rachel leigh cook
, is simply horrible
. i usually don
' t like to get so personal
,
but inaddition this case
, i think it needs to be said
. cook wears the same expression throughout the flick
and looks tothe be having as miserable a time as i ws
. i was never convinced that she was a
" nerd
"
,
and her transformation wass unconvincing adn unnecessary
. the movie seems to be saying it
' s better to be popular than to be who you are
. as for freddie prinze jr
.
, an actor i oridinarily enjoy
, he too is quite bad here
. he coasts through the film on so
- called charm
,
and never establishes a real character
. kieren culkin is here
, too
, as the brother of cook
.
and for some indiscernable reason
, he
' s got hearing aids
. no explination is given
and they
' re never brought up
. were we suppoed to feel
* sorry
* for him just because he wore hearing aids
? i don
' t think so
. that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i
' ve seen inspite a movie in a long time
.
" she
' s all that
" sucks
. that
' s what it boils down to
. it
' s not entertaining
,
and it
' s not even a good time passer
. tje hour
and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair
- removal system informercial
. adn whta
' s worse
, it sends out a bad message to teens
. it appears tothe be telling them
,
" hey
, it doesn
' t marter if you
' re happy the way you are
. that
' s unimportant
. if you want to
* truly
* be happy
, dress in the latest fashions
and act like a bubble
- headed moron
.
" ugh
.
