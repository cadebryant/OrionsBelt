" in dreams
" might keep you awake at night
,
but not because of its creepy imagery
, bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths
. noone
, the source ofthe potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie
' s brutally squ
andered potential
, the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise
- even by tired serial killer genre st
andards
. the big letdown
,
however
, comes upon the relization that this 100
- minute head
- scratcher was masterminded by neil jordan
, the man behind
" the crying game
.
" he
' s no stranger to cinematic weirdness
,
but this nutty nonsence really pushes tyhe envelope
. things start out storng enough
, with cinematographer darius khondji
' s stunning camera work guiding viewers into the bowels of a underwater ghost town durring a creepy prologue that establishes a notably grim tone right off the bat
. this eerie opulence rimaniss a dazzling display of showmanship throughout the entire film
- there
' s even something macabre about the way khondji photographs a rustic
, seemingly innocent new engl
and autumn
-
but if there ever was a film that didn
' t deserve so good a polish
, it
' s this one
. don
' t knock the look
,
but say what you will about the foolish plot
, underdeveloped characters
and flat dialogue
. annette bening
, another asset
" in dreasm
" shouldn
' t be so lucky to boast
, gives an increasingly effective performance in a role that doesn
' t do much for her inthe return
. she plays claire cooper
, a massachusetts children
' s book illustrator who
' s plagued by terrifying nightmares involving kidnaped children
. she thinks theese visions are a warning knell for horrable
, soon
- to
- be
- committed crimes
,
but neither her ho
- hum husb
and
( aidan quinn
) nor hte ho
- hummer police can muster up the sense to take her seriously
. tihs being a thriller
, we know that she is
, in fact
, onthe the omney
, annd it
' s a credit to bening
' s acting that she delves equally into claire
' s madness
and compassion
.
but as soon as a body turns up
and claire has given the authorities reason enough tothe believe her claims
,
" in dreams
" trades in its nifty supernatural chills for a long series of allegedly spooky jolts that simply refuse to amke sense
. scenes pile up like a car wreck with little or no explanation or exposition
. subplots appear
and disappear
. when claire finally comes face
- to
- face with our evil murderer
( robert downey jr
.
)
, it turns out his name is vivian
, he
' s clairvoiant
and he
' s got some major issues with mama
, a la norman bates
.
" in dreams
" reaches its absurdist zenith here
,
and the climax drags with mumbled revelations
and laughable twists
. soem questions
,
then
: what
' s with the garbage disposal retching applesauce
? are the drawings on the wall blood or paint
? who cranked up the
andrews sisters on the cd player
and caused the swing to move on its own
? whta about the computer
? does vivian possess the gift of telekinesis in addition to his other powers
? why would he continually endanger claire if she was necessary for his ulitmate plan
? is the woman in australia integral to anything
?
and the aforementioned flooded city
- what function does tath
_ really
_ serve
? sigh
. at least inwhich my own dreams
, i can imagine a better movie where certain talent didn
' t go to waste
.
