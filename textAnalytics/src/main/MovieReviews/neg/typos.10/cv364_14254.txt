dear god
, this is a fantastically bad film
! regardless ofthe what i sday baout knock off
, you can ' t grasp its awfulness from my words
. you have to see it
anbd experience it for yourself
. here ' s the kicker
,
though
-
- i suggest that you do so
. yes
, thsi is a bad film
-
- easily one ofthe the most incompetent films of the year
-
-
but it hasnt a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind ofthe disaster to endure
. in fact
, i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time
, despite the dreadful acting
and a completely incomprehensible story
. don ' t get me wrong
: i ' m not excusing knock off
. it reaches an unacceptable level of badness
; it ' s so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers ws
. it aslo features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon
, michael wong
, paul sorvino
,
adn
-
- of course
-
- jean
- claude van damme
. it does
,
however
, have the entertaining presence of rob schneider
,
and the excessively inventive
and pretentious direction of tsui hark
. as i watched it
, i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness
. now
, in retrospect
, it seems clear that it wasn ' t
,
but it ' s still a fascinating kind of mess
. i don ' t like writing plot descriptions
( it is
, by far
, the most boring part of wirting a review
)
,
but
, in this case
, i ' m off the hook
: there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off
. for the sake of comparision
, i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing
. i paid closer attention to knock off
,
annd the only thing i am able to sday about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray
,
and is accused by thte cia
( i think
) of selling knock off products
( knock off products are
, of course
, products that look like name
- brand materials
but are generic
and cheap
)
. i don ' t know what any ofthe this has to do with martial arts
,
but there are lots of martial arts in the film
. ravy is good at martial arts
, so when he has to beat uv bad guys
, there ' s no problem
. rob schneider plays his sidekick
,
although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film
. lela rochon is just smoe woman who accuses them of stuff
, while paul sorvino is both the good guy
and the bad guy at once
! in fact
, eveyr character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutly no insight into what any of them really do
. in that order
, knock off is completly incoherent
adn makes absolutely no sense
.
but what a strange mess it is
. it was written by stephen e
. de souza
, who also wrote die hard
and 48 hours
. cin this be the same man
? i don ' t see how
, unless
, of course
, huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time
. knock off seems to haev an interesting premise
( as far as action films go
)
,
but there ' s no semblance here
. for instance
, van damme is introduced
,
and
then seconds later he ' s running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong
. why
? who knows
. what are the implications of this
? i have no idea
. most action films abandon depth in favor of action
,
and this is normally a problem
. knock off
,
however
, is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut
. the acting isnt embarrassingly bad
: rochon
, in particular
, delivers each of her lines with stiff
adn talentless insincerity
. sorvino
, infront addition
, deserves better than this
. van damme isnt bad
,
but he ' s charming iin that bad way
,
and so i can ' t say that he ' s hard tothe watch
(
although i rarely understood what he was saying
)
. the only exception is rob schneider
, who isnt acually quite funny a lot of the time
. tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparsion
. they ' re all pointless gimmicks
though
, such as shots of the inner
- workings of a knock off running shoe
.
but his acation scenes are never boring
: one particular piece inside of a fruit factory
( a fruit factory
?
) is well
- choreographed
. lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy
, such as our heroes ' first encounter with the rochon character
.
but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous
? i hope he did
, forthe the alternative is a frightening thought
. knock off has the fiel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania
. if it were boring
, i ' d give it zero stars
.
but it ' s not boring
: it ' s loud
and excessive
and completely incoherent
. it ' s also funny
, even when it isn ' t meaning to be funny
. a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn ' t deserve to be fully lambasted
. i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness
,
but i can ' t deny it ' s zany
, useless charm
. oh
, i knwo
, tehy ' re just action scenes looking desperately for a real story
,
but they ' re fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts
. it ' s funn to admire the awfulness of a film liek this
,
but that doesn ' t excuse tghe fact that it isnt
, indeed
, awful
.
