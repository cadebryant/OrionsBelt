well
, what are you going to expect
? it
' s a movie about a big snake that eats people
. that
' s what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film
, because maybe
then i would have enjoyed myself more
. instead
, i ended up wishing a giant snake woudl come along
and eat me
, too
. anaconda isnt baout a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river
. led by anthropologists dr
. steven cale
( eric stolz
)
and terri flores
( jennifer lopez
)
, the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives
. along the way
, they find poacher paul sarone
( jon voight
)
,
and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda
. to simply say that this is the world
' s largest snake wouldn
' t be doing it justice
, since tje anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide
. if this isn
' t a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers
, i don
' t know what is
. at the beginning of anaconda
, we find that flores
and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past
,
but that seems to be more or less over now
. i expected that fact tothe play a key part somewhere down the line
,
but it ended up being a set
- up for nothing
. cale chokes on a deadly wasp
( don
' t ask me how that happens
- i don
' t knwo
)
and is put out of action
, relegated to being the person whom the rest of tjhe film crew must get back to civilization for medical help
. this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot
, since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone
' s plan to capture hte snake
. howver
, this is negated by the fatc that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film
, anbd in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle
. most bad characters are either annoying or stupid
. in this movie
, tehy
' re both
. since this description applies to all the characters exept sarone
, it
' s hard tothe find someone to root for
. you
' re supposed tothe back the good guys
,
but you really end up cheering for sarone because he
' s smarter than everyone else
. or maybe he
' s just not as dumb as everyone else
. at times
, i almost found myself rooting for the snake
. there are no st
andout performances here
. everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters
. even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason
. no matter
, as in most monster movies
, the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway
. in most of the scenes
, the snake is computer generated
,
and the effects crew doed a decent job of making it look real
. howver
, the realism is thrown off by some preety unrealistic occurrences
. somtimes
, for example
, the snake just moves too fast
. it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall
, for crying out loud
.
then there
' s another scene where the snake eats one of the charactors
,
and we see the snake
' s skin drawed so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim
' s pained expression from within tjhe snake
' s belly
. absolutely ridiculous
. a testimony to thge film
' s bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film
, where we get to see jstu how dangerous the mighty anaconda is
. in a scene totally unrelated to anything else
, we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther
. the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal
and squeezes it so hard
, oney of the panther
' s eyeballs pops outloud
. eeeewwwww
. above
and beyond the sick factor
,
however
, this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed
. in films like these
, a sense ofthe mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained
. if the charactors are reacting tothe something they fear more than see
, we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them
. to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don
' t know about
,
and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man
and beast have their climactic showdown
. in a case like that
, the showdown just ends up being a letdown
. whn i saw the snake for the first timne
, i decided to give the film thge benefit of the doubt
and assume that the snake i saw wasn
' t the real danger
. this one was just a decoy
,
and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearence just when everyone
thought they weere safe
. no such luck
. okay
, maybe anaconda isnt actually a decoy
, annd there
' s relaly a better movie waiting to amke its de
but
.
