here ' s something to chew on
: what ' s the favorite food of big
, cheesy
- looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising
? the obvious answer to this question is cardboard
, because that ' s the depth of the most fully
- developed charater in this painfully generic creature feature
. deep rising demonstrates all the originality
annd vitality of something scripted by a computer
. in fact
, considering the rigid adherence tothe the expected formulas
, perheaps it was
. the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore
. not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh
( both human
and non
- human
) been scattered in all directions
. we learn some bloody trivia
, as well
, such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red
( it drinks a human bieng
then spits out the liquefied remains
)
and what it does with half
- digested leftovers
. i suppose deep rising ' s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stfuf for those who love the macabre
,
but it doesn ' t do much for me
. on the surface
,
and that ' s about the only level at which this film can be analyzed
, deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic
( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens
/ titanic connection
, sicne james cameron directed both
)
. in going fo the big disaster anle of titanic
and the tongue
- in
- cheek mayhem of tremors
, deep rising somehow misses both markes by a wide margin
. the film is not humorous
, tense
, or exciting
. in fatc
, it ' s downright boring
,
and
, despite being half the length of cameron ' s current box
- office champ
, deep rising feels like the longer movie
. is it raelly necessary to say anything about the plot
? probably not
, usance it ' s easy to guess
,
but i ' ll go ahead
and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis
. the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys onthe board a mercenary ship
. in addition tothe the usual cast of psychopaths
adn lunatics
, there ' s finnegan
( treat williams
)
, tghe boat ' s pilot
, who ' s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff
; joey
( kevin j
. o ' connor
)
, the inept sidekick who ' s supposed to be lovable
and funny
(
but is raelly jstu irritating
)
;
and hanover
( wes studi
)
, the
" mastermind
"
(
and i use that term lightly
) of the operation
. their gool
: attack a cruise ship
, clean outloud the safe
,
then sink it using some illegally
- aquired torpedoes
. hte problem is
, by the time they reach the argonautica
, the titanic
- like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste
. asside from a beautiful jewel thieve
( famke janssen
)
anbd a couple of crew members
, there ' s no one on board
. the reason soon becomes obvious
-
- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to ressemble an octopus with teeth
and more than eight tentacles
. the cast
, which is led by treat williams
, is primarily comprised of has
- beens
and probably
- never
- wiull
- bes
( two exceptions
: wes studi
, best known as the villain inthe the last of the mohicans
,
and djimon hounsou
, amistad ' s cinque
)
. williams
, once a
" can ' t miss
" prospect in hollywood
, has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these dyas for a lead role is a film like deep rising
,
and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career
. famke janssen
, who will forever be known as xenia onatopp ffrom goldeneye
, isnt the perfect bland match for williams
. given her limited acting abilities
, it ' s likely that she was choosen for tihs part primarly onthe the basis of her physical attributes
. unfortunately
, a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee
- shirt forthe half of the picture
. meanwhile
, kevin j
. o ' connor
, who has entirely too much screen time
, exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard
. these days
, audiences are becoming more difficult tothe impress with computer
- generated special effects
. this is a lesson that writer
/ director stephen sommers
( who previously helmed the live
- action jungle book
) needs to leran
. the days of jurassic park
, when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big
annd imposing on screen
, are past
. nowe
, movie
- goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic
-
- visuals that are so well
- incorporated that it ' s impossible to tell where they end
and where
" reality
" beggins
. in deep rising
, the monster
, like everything
, is artificial
and unconvincing
. unfortunately
, the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn ' t so much the idiotic monotony ofthe this individule picture
,
but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre
(
allthough
, to be fair
, deep rising isnt a particularly bad entry
)
. even once this film has sunk outloud ofthe sight
, the knowledgeable viewer knows it won ' t be the last of its kind
. like the slimy
, slithering things that inhabit the air vents
and pipes of these movies
, mroe are waiting just around the corner inthe ambush
.
and that consideration
, unlike anything onthe screen
, is truly horrifying
.
