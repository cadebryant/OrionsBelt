here
' s something tothe chew on
: what
' s the favorite food of big
, cheesy
- looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising
? tje obvious answer to this question is cardboard
, becuase that
' s the depth of the most fully
- developped chracter in this painfully generic creature feature
. deep rising demonstrates all the originality
and vitality of something scripted by a computer
. infact fact
, considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas
, perhaps it was
. the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore
. not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh
( both human
and non
- human
) been scattered in all directions
. we learn soem bloody trivia
, as well
, such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red
( it drinks a human being
then spits out tyhe liquefied remains
)
and what it does with half
- digested leftovers
. i suppose deep rising
' s gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for thsoe who lvoe the macabre
,
but it doesn
' t dont much for me
. on the surfce
,
and that
' s about the only levle at which thsi film can be analyzed
, deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic
( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens
/ titanic connection
, since james cameron directed both
)
. in going for the big disaster angle of titanic
and the tongue
- in
- cheek mayhem of tremors
, deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin
. the film is not humorous
, tense
, or exciting
. in fact
, it
' s downright boring
,
and
, despite being half the length of cameron
' s current box
- office champ
, deep rising fiels like the longer movie
. is it really necessary to say anything about the plot
? probably not
, since it
' s easy to guess
,
but i
' ll go ahead
and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis
. the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship
. inspite adition tothe the usual cast of psychopaths
and lunatics
, there
' s finnegan
( treat williams
)
, the boat
' s pilot
, who
' s supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff
; joey
( kevin j
. o
' connor
)
, the inept sidekick who
' s supposed to be lovable
and funny
(
but is really just irritating
)
;
and hanover
( wes studi
)
, the
" mastermind
"
(
and i use that term lightly
) of the operation
. their goal
: attack a cruise ship
, clean out the safe
,
then sink it using some illegally
- acquired torpedoes
. the probelm is
, by the time they reach the argonautica
, the titanic
- like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste
. aside from a beautiful jewel thief
( famke janssen
) adn a couple of crew members
, there
' s noone one on board
. the reason soon becomes obvious
-
- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth annd more than eight tentacles
. the cast
, which is led by treat williams
, is primarily comprised of has
- beens
and probably
- never
- will
- bes
( twpo exceptions
: wes studi
, best known as thge villain in hte lastr of yhe mohicans
,
and djimon hounsou
, amistad
' s cinque
)
. williams
, once a
" can
' t miss
" prospect in hollywood
, has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deepo rising
,
and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career
. famke janssen
, who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye
, is the perfect bl
and match for williams
. given her limited acting abilities
, it
' s likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attri
butes
. unfortunately
, a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee
- shirt for half of tghe picture
. meanwhile
, kevin j
. o
' connor
, who has entirely too much screen time
, exhibits all the appeal ofthe fingernails scratching a blackboard
. these days
, audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer
- generated special effects
. tihs is a lesson that writer
/ director stephen sommers
( who previously helmed the live
- action jungle book
) needs to learn
. the days of jurassic park
, when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big
and imposing on screen
, are past
. nowe
, movie
- goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic
-
- visuals that are so well
- incorportaed that it
' s impossible to tell where htey end
and where
" reality
" begins
. in deep rising
, the monster
, like everything
, is artificial
and unconvincing
. unfortunately
, the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn
' t so much the idiotic monotony of thsi individual picture
,
but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre
(
al
though
, to be fair
, deep rising is a particularly bad entry
)
. even once this film has sunk out of sight
, tjhe knowledgeable viewer knows it won
' t be the last of its kind
. like the slimy
, slithering things that inhabit the air vents anbd pipes of these movies
, more are waiting just around the corner infront ambush
.
and that consideration
, unlike anything on screen
, is truly horrifying
.
