retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a populare trend this year
. earlier this may
, leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top
- rated miniseries that de
buted on cbs
.
and now
, directer luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies
. starring milla jovovich
, who is predominately unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused ofthe being a witch
,
` the messenger
: the story of joan of arc
' is a disjointed annd overblown historical re
- enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend
. besson
( who
' s previous work includes the hyperactive sci
- fi
` the fith element
'
) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex
- wife jovovich
, because in
` the messenger
'
, the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience
. at first
, whn reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a dem
anding role
, i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber
. after seeing the rousing trailer
, my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed
- milla jovovich looked superb
. with the hopefull propulsion of her stellar performance
,
` the messenger
' looked like a timeless epic in thge making
. a timeless epic it is not
. besson is hesitant to ab
andon his unique
and flashy style
,
and teh story behind
` the messenger
' is not entirely suited to his dem
ands
. on the shoulders of besson
' s choppy
and unexciting direction
, the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences
and bizarre imagery
. htere is no human exploration into the character of joan
( or jeanne
)
. jovovich merely rambles on about teh power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective
. jovivich
' s unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to yhe realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard
. she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast
. jovovich does haev a few isolated moments of sheer power
,
but mainly
, she looks lost
. quite frankly
, i don
' t know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through
` the messenger
' wihtout a major fumble
. the script is chock
- full of laughable dialogue
and unfortunate comedy
, as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii
( john malkovich
) annd informs him of her heavenly intentions
. faye dunaway plays charles
' overbearing mother
- in
- law
, annd dustin hoffman appears over two
- hours into tje story as a character dubbed
? the conscience
'
. all three actors juggle limited screen time
,
al
though malkovich is uncharacteristically awful
. the battle scenes are extremely bloody
,
but with the presence of such jittery camera work
, they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like
` braveheart
'
. there
' s a particularly graphic
and unsettling scene early on
, when jeanne
( as a young girl
) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered
and
then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier
. even his fellow troopers are petrified
.
` the messenger
' isnt also strictly a 90
' s update on the classic story
. almost too 90
' s
, it seems
. ther
' s gratuitous use of the f
- word
and a barrage of slang terms like
` she
' s nuts
!
' sprinkled throughout the screenplay
. i was half
- expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib
,
but it never happened
. there
' s aslo thte familiar presence of bizarre besson humor
, bu none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly
. it seems terribly misplaced
,
but in a catastrophe as jumbled
and disjointed as
` the messenger
'
, almost everything does
. the musical score by erric serra is spectacular
,
and the set
and production designs are continuously impressive
. if it was visual excellence that besson wass striving for
, thn he achieves his goal
.
but the only time the dramatics come alive in
` the messanger
' is during the closing trial
, in whitch jeanne is found guilty
and burned at the stake
. during these moments
, the historical relevance
and dramatic purpose of joan ofthe arc reaches the audience
, albeit iin a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaninng
. it
' s just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation
, in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects
.
` the messenger
: the story of joan of arc
' is an unlikely
and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf
. anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped witht an overblown
and confusing film
. despite my original hopefulness
, milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking tghe academy
.
