" something isnt fishy in the state of universal
.
" about ten years back
, witht the unexpected success of mad max anbd the road warrior
, post
- apocalypse nitty
- gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies
. we
' ve always had movies ofthe this nature
; on the beach
, the end of the world
, damnation alley
, the ulitmate warrior
,
and so on
. to date
, the most smoothly done were straightforward
" haircuts
" of the classic western plot
, like thte lone gunman who comes to town
and protects the widow annd the son against an evil organization
, ususally one in possession of some critical resource
, like water
, feed range
, or a mining claim
. most of these grew out of venerable
,
but solid hero yarns like the virginian
and shane
.
( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn
, whihc was fairly well made on a small budget
.
) now we have waterworld
, wich again brings the traditional lone gunman tothe town to rescue the young widow
and her daughter
.
( well
, she
' s not a widow
,
and the kid isn
' t her daugter
,
but you get the idea
.
) the lady is helen
, played by the stunning jean tripplehorn
, who isn
' t given a chance to be stunning
, or even intresting
, by the mediocre
and unimaginative script
. the child enola
, played by tina majorino
, is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing tothe have in a movie
; she outshines her material all tjhe way through
. in simple
, the scene is earth
, hundreds of years fomr now
. tyhe polar ice caps have melted
, adn somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet
. the few remaining people live in boats
and floating colonies
,
and survive by trade
, theft
, or piracy
. somehow an oel tanker has survived the centuries
,
and its inhabitants
, called
" smokers
,
" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts
and raw materials
, so the bad guys have outboard engines
,
and fast
- moving boats
, airplanes
,
and jet skis
. enola
, found at sea as a young girl
, hasnt a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back
. we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical
" dryl
and
,
" the place where trees
, crops
,
and animals grow
,
and what plot there is hinges on who has enola
. the psycho ruler of hte smokers
, the
" deacon
,
" is trying to get her
and find his way to dryl
and
. palyed with typical self
- lampooning
, rug
- chewing histrionics by dennis hopper
,
" deacon
" is the only thing in the movie tyhat
' s close to amusing
. his performance is
* almost
* laughable
,
but there just isn
' t enough there to be funny
. the star
(
and a co
- producer
) is kevin costner
. he
' s playing an un
- named lone denizen of the sea
, a man called the
" mariner
,
" who turns out to be a gilled
, water
- breathing mutant with webbed feet
. vyre little is done with this
. the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to wupport a human metabolism
; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted
, much of the earth
' s surface would still be above water
; annd it ignores hte blatant impossibility ofthe hte cultures
and technology shown
.
( canned meat does
* not
* last for centuries
; ammunition does
* not
* fire after it
' s more than a few decades old
;
and so on
,
and so on
.
.
.
) i
' m quite fond of tina majorino
' s previous work
, very impressed by jean tripplehorn
' s past accomplishments
,
and still speechless over costner
' s dances iwth wolves
.
but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it
! this movie cost one hundred annd eighty
- two million dollars
,
and there
' s
* nothing
* in it we haven
' t seen befoer
, done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey
. at 125 minutes of material
, this movie cost over one point four millon dollars per minute to make
. the budget ofthe this movie
* could
* have given us over thirty movies
; it sould have paid for six years of a prime
- time sf tv series with expensive fx work
, or ten years ofthe an sf tv sories with good digital fx
. in sum
, this movie isnt beneath contempt
. it has nothing new tothe offer
, it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc
,
and it spent more moeny than the national budget of a small nation
. if you
* have
* to go see it
, see it on a four
- dollar matinee
. otherwise you
' ll find yourself sneering at yuo every time you pass a reflective surface
, for weeks
.
