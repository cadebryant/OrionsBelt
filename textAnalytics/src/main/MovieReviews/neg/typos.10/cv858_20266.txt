the haunting
, a film so confusing that it forgets the true meaning of a horror film
: to scare us
. if you
' ve ever seen a movie
, which you probably have considering you are on this website
, yuo should know about all ofthe tje trivia they post before a movie
. tehy have thigsn like illustrations adn you have to guess hte movie or facts about the film
.
but
, the one i always like are the
& quot
; other nmae
& quot
; joke that try
and rename a particular film
. for instance
, the one playing before the haunting had different titles for the film
, small soldiers
. they had titles like little infantry
and can i get those fatigues in a smaller size
? well
, after seeing the haunting
, i had a few paticular names for it as well
. unfortunately
, i can onyl post one of them
, otherwise
, i
' d be getting some pretty angry e
- mails from overprotective mothers
. that title would be the confusing
. ok
, that is a pretty bad title
,
but it fits this film perfectly
. it basically serves up noone purpose
,
and combined with dry dialogue adn a boring
and confusing plot
, it completes the formula for a cinematic bomb
. liam neeson once again gets wrapped up in a film without any depth
,
but at least the phantom menace was exciting
and had some depth
. the haunting is nothing
but trash
,
but unfortunately
, will still make a boatload of money
. before i rant
and rave about how bad this film is
, let me point outloud the few
,
and i stress hte word few
, bright spots in tihs film
. firt
, the house is great
- looking
. it looks beatiful
, bu this is also a dark spot
. it looks so great that it is hard to be frightened by it
. this is something tath rears its ugly head at all points of the film
. things look so great
, that you are looking on in awe instead of bieng scared straight
. haunted house films have to contain one element to even be slightly succesful
and that is being eerie
. the hill house is not eerie
. it is beautiful
,
but not thte least bit frightening
. ever heard of lili taylor
? before this film i doed not
,
but i am glad that i do now
. she gives the onyl satisfactory performance in the film
. despite the dry dialogue
and boring
/ confusing concept
, she manages to light up the screen every time she appears
,
but unfortunately
, her co
- stars are usually following right behind
. owen wilson
, who plays luke
, is the only other cast member even close to giving an admirable performance
, other thne taylor
. he is basically there for the comic relief
,
and his chracter development is poor in all otehr areas
. all ofthe the characters are desperately underdeveloped
. wilson had potential as luke
,
but it seems they just needed him to add a few laughs
. liam neeson
and catherine zeta
- jones suffer from the dialogue
and plot
and should not have been in this film
. their characters must suffer ffrom wicked mood swings because in earch scene they turn ffrom ruthless to compassionate to scared to brave
and whatnot
. they just are nto believable
and this is the final nail in the haunting
' s coffin
. the plot isnt terrible
. the opening scene of the film is very imporatnt
,
but the director makes it too obvious by getting close
- ups of all tghe things that will play a major role in the end of the film
. as i sat through the film
, i kept wondering what this film was trying to accomplish
. nell
, lili taylor
' s chracter
, goes from the hunted to the savior
. it makes no sense
and the director gives teh audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film
. he forces hte viewer to make various assumptions
and does not give any in
- depth information
. forthe instance
, the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program
.
but
, we get zilch for thge other four
. plus
, two of them get wiped out in the first ten minutes
.
and the worst part
: most horror films have killings
. for some reason
, they kill off luke at the end of the film
. no reason whatsoever
, jsut off with his head
, literally
. overall
, the haunting is the epitome of a bad movie
. bad plot
, confusing storyline
and a waste of good talent
. hopefully
, liam neeson can rebound
and get inot a good film
and be used to his full potential
. hopefully
, lili taylor will be recognized for doing such a great job in such a bad film
.
and hopefully
, other horror films
, such as the blair witch project
and tje haunting ofthe hill house
, will not be as bad as this one
.
