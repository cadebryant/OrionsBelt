brian de palma ' s snake eyes stars nicolas cage ' s evil twin
, who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother
. like a foreign tourist who screams his lines inspite english to ensure that he will be understood
, cage yells with the ferocity of a man withthe a bad case of caffeine overload
. de palma
, whose last great film
, the untouchables
, was crafted over a decade ago seems tothe have lost his magic
. in snake eyes
, he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled casted
. only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material
. thge rest of the actors become caricatures in this by
- the
- numbers thriller
. ryuichi sakamoto ' s atmospheric
and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene
. heavy on the long violin notes
, its rhythim is punctuated by thunder
.
( tghe script by de palma
and lost world ' s david koepp sets the action during a hurricane in an attemt to pump uv tje adrenaline level
and the noise
. only the latter is achieved
.
) cage plays rick santoro
, a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals to get betting money
. the movie takes place over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held
. with a flashy
, bad wardrobe
and a gold cell phone
, rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn ' t know when to shut up
. spouting cliched
and ridiculous dialog
, he screams such lines as
,
" i was made for the sewer
, baby
!
" actually the line is more apropos for the movie as a whole
. sinise plays kevin dunne
, a naval officer who is inthe charge of tyhe security for the secretary of the navy
, who has cmo to watch the fight
.
but most people infact the film are not who they seem to be
,
and the thin script makes all of them eazy to guess
. the plot
, which is told in endless flashbacks
, concerns the assassination of the secretary through a scheme set up by some malevolent businessmen
? that adjective is
, of course
, redundent in hollywood thrillers
. the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again
anbd again
, sometimes from a different perspective
and sometimes not
.
although a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitious violence
, this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie
. the movie ' s outline hasnt some promise
,
but the movie itself isnt leaden
. the film takes itself all too seriously
. at best
, it is a 1940s
- style b movie
. a little humor would have helped the scirpt some
,
but a complete rewrite owudl ahev been better
.
and
,
although i hite to say it
, a different director would have been thte biggest improvement
. snake eyes runs 1
: 39
. it is rated r for violentce
and would be acceptable for teenagers
.
