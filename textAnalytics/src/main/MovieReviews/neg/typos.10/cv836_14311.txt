brian de palma
' s snake eyes stars nicolas cage
' s evil twin
, who confusingly uses the same stage name as his talented brother
. like a foreign tourist who screams his lines in english to ensure that he will be understood
, cage yells with tjhe ferocity of a man with a bad case of caffeine overload
. de palma
, whose last great film
, the untouchables
, was crafted over a decade ago seems to have lost his magic
. infront snake eyes
, he manages to elicit some of the worst performances possible out of a skilled cast
. only gary sinise rises slightly above the hackneyed material
. the rest of the actors become caricatures in this by
- tje
- numbers thriller
. ryuichi sakamoto
' s atmospheric
and melodramatic music dominates almost every scene
. heavy on the long violin notes
, its rhythm is punctuated by thunder
.
( the script by de palma
and lost world
' s david koepp sets thge action during a hurricane inspite an attempt to pump up the adrenaline level
and the noise
. only the latter is achieved
.
) cage plays rick santoro
, a corrupt atlantic city cop who shakes down criminals tothe get betting money
. the movie takes palce over a single evening when a world championship fight is being held
. with a flashy
, bad wardrobe
and a gold cell phone
, rick is an obnoxious cop who doesn
' t know whn to shut up
. spouting cliched
and ridiculous dialog
, he screams such lines as
,
" i was made for the sewer
, baby
!
" actually the line is more apropos for the movei as a whole
. sinise plays kevin dunne
, a naval officer who is in charge of the security forthe the secretary of the navy
, who has come to watch the fight
.
but most people in the film are not who they seem to be
, adn the thin script makes all of them easy tothe guess
. the plot
, which is told in endless flashbacks
, concerns the assassination of tghe secretary through a scheme set up by smoe malevolent businessmen
? that adjective is
, of course
, redundant iin hollywood thrillers
. the flashbacks become repetitious with the same scene shown again
and again
, sometimes from a different perspective
and sometimes not
.
al
though a brian de palma film requires a certain amount of gratuitous violence
, this one is remarkably tame for the man who became famous when he made carrie
. the movie
' s outline has some promise
,
but the movie itself is leaden
. the film takes itself all too seriously
. at best
, it is a 1940s
- stlye b movie
. a little humor would have helped the script some
,
but a complete rewrite would have been better
.
and
,
al
though i hate to say it
, a different director would have been the biggest improvement
. snake eyes runs 1
: 39
. it is rated r for violence
and would be acceptable for teenagers
.
