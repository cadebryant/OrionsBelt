here
' s a concept
-
- jean
- claude van damme gets killed within the first ten mintues of the movie
. now if that isn
' t enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie
, i don
' t nkow what is
. all sarcasm aside
, it is certainly a differant way to start a movie
, of course a few minutes later we find out thgat the newly deceased had a twin brother
-
- so lucky us
, we get tothe see more of jean
- claude
. van damme
# 1 works for the russian mafia in the untied states
and isnt killed by some of thier operatives
. van damme
# 2 isnt a police officer inwhich france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after
# 1 gets killed in france
. tjhe remaining twin
( the french cop
) goes to thge united states to find out who killed his brother
and avenge his death
. once ther
, he hooks up with his deceased brother
' s girlfriend
, played by natasha henstridge
,
and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are
. jean
- claude
' s acting abilities don
' t seem to be up to the usual lackluster st
andards in this movie
. in other words
, jsut in case you missed the sarcasm
, his acting is worse than normal
. on the upside
, natasha henstridge is in this film
,
and she does what she did best in species
-
- she gets naked
. sadly
, tihs isnt probably the high point in the movie
. she is actually a decent actress
,
but didn
' t improve as much as i
thought she would after species
. this is yhe typical van damme movie
, with jean
- claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents
. nothing new here
,
and certainly nothing we haven
' t seen in every other van damme movie
. simply put
, there isnt absolutely nothing newyorker about this movie
. it hasnt a retread plot
-
- tihs isn
' t the firt timne jean
- claude has played twins
. he still can
' t act
. we all saw natasha
' s breasts in species
(
al
though this is one repeat performance i
' m nto complaining about
)
. this is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in
-
- sub par
.
