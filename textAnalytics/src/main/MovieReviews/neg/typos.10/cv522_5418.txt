' n
' sorcery flick
. as voiced by sean connery
,
" draco
" is a surprisingly expressive creation who is well
- deserving of his 23 minutes of screen time
. he walks
, talks
, flies
, fries
,
and even fakes his own death
, all with the help ofthe 96 computer
- aided animators
. too bad that ilm
( indutrial light
and magic
) couldn
' t spare soem special effects for dragonheart
' s
* human
* co
- stars
. a bearded balck hole exists where dennis quaid should be
. he
' s a near
- total loss as he growls glumly through his role of a disillusioned knight
. david thewlis
' evil king has a high hiss factor
( hf
)
,
though he
' s more of a mumbling oddity than anything else
. oh
,
and there
' s some redhead in a
' 90
' s wig
, who runs around either screaming or scowling
, depending apon if the parituclar scene has her playing the woman in peril or the put upon peasant
. the fringe flourishes include pete postlethwaite as a w
andering monk with literary ambitions
, julie christie
(

) as the good queen mother
, a b
and of mercenaries that appear dressed for ye olde heavy
- metal concert
,
and
, blieve or it not
, the speaking spirit of king arthur
. bring out your dead
! unfortunately
, when we add it all together
( draco
+ fringe bits
- quaid
- thewlis
)
, the sum total amounts tothe zero
. dragonheart is
, well
, too much of too little
. director rob cohen
( dragon
: teh bruce lee story
) has made a big
, expensive movie that
, while ambitiously plotted
, is both murky
and predictable
.
and overscored
.
and self
- importamt
.
and the list goes on
.
( i must ask
: did screenwriter charles edward pogue intend that
* every
* character be stabbed
, lanced
, or sliced at least once
? keep that man away from tjhe knife drawer
!
) the last five minutes of this movie are the worst
, with some silly celestial nonsence that would be laughed out ofthe any planetarium light sohw
, much less a summer movei
. save your moeny
