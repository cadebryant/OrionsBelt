jet li busted onto the american action movie scene
, when he stole teh show in 1998 ' s leathal weapon 4
, with his wicked looks
, his nasty moves
and his undeniable charisma
. it only took another two years fo mega
- producer joel silver to set him up in an all
- american movie
, primed to take over some of thte empty action
- hero seats left by alledged coke
- head van damme
and that pudgy guy named steven seagal
. would htis film take li past his rival asian action counterparts
, namely chow yun
- fat
and jackie chan
? let ' s find out
. plot
: rival chinese
and black gangster organizations fall furhter out of favor from one another
, when members ofthe their respective families start turning up dead
. that ' s when badass jet li blasts into the picture tothe find out who the men were behind his brother ' s death
adn to exact some of his pwn style of revenge
. critique
: three words
: not anough action
! simple enough
? not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay
, bad actors
, crappy dialogue
and oh
- so many over
- tghe
- top melodramatic moments
.
and a romance angle
? why
, one must ask
.
.
. why
? i love fight scenes
and i really dig jet li too
,
but this little ditty bearly contained three memorable action sequences
,
and jet
, well
, the poor dude was barely in the movei
.
and i thought thsi was supposed to be his big break
? how ' bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung
- fu fighting chops
, slap him in a few more scenes
,
and give him more chances to pratice his acting
/ english abilities
? what a letdown
. even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up
, empty shell of a film
. in fact
, i am sure that more time was spent gathering the
" hits
" for the soundtrack of this film
, than were on the so
- called
" screenplay
"
. i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time
. the sad part about the bad script is that it wouldn ' t marter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines
.
but no
, save lindo
and aaliyah
, who weren ' t too shabby
, i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their iability to deliver lines convincingly
.
and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15
- year old looking guy
, acting like he ' s the overlord of a drug ring
?
! what a mess
.
then again
, i don ' t want it to seem like i ' m complaining solely about the story wich was completely forseeable
, since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway
, nto the story
. well
, i guess that ' s what disappointed me the most outloud of this film
. there were a cuple of cool fight scenes with li
,
but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving
. also
, as much as i love the way they incorporate wires
and special effects in some of their stunts
, a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt
. it should be seamless
, fellas
, not necessarily against thge laws of gravity
! the one cool thing that was orignal in the movie was thge way inthe which the directer showed us some of the inside cracklings of thte human body when penetrated by a blow
,
bu thast simple creative touch couldn ' t save the rest of tihs film ' s uninteresting plot movements
. i ' m disappointed for jet li that htis film didn ' t give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes
. hopefully
, the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor
. for now
, i just hope that for his sake
, the film ' s title isn ' t a premonition of the movei ' s ulitmate fate at yhe box
- office
.
