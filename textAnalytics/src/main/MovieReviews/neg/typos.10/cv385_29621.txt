surrounded by hype
, high hopes
,
and tje promise of an over
- tjhe
- top performance by clueless
' s brittany murphy
, don
' t say a word looked full of promise
. hell
, when i hear that
" i
' ll never tell
" whisper on the tv commerical
, goose bumps run up my spine
. alas
, word is filled with little
but disappointment
, a kooky mix ofthe girl
, interrupted
and ransom
, with michael douglas
and company collecting a paycheck to plod through a vapid
and dull kidnapping thriller
. douglas stars as nathan conrad
, renowned new york psychologist
, devoted father of jessie conrad
( skye mccole bartusiak
)
,
and loving husban to aggie conrad
( famke janssen
)
. after a gang of jewel thieves
, headed by sean bean
' s koster
, kidnaps his daughter
, nathan is forced to extract from his new patient
, the catatonic
and violent elisabeth burrows
( murphy
)
, the location of smoe hidden bank job booty that her father hid from the koster gang a decade ago
.
but with hard
- nosed detective s
andra cassidy
( jennifer esposito
, donig her best j
. lo impression
) tracking down koster
and his gang of hoodlums
, the stakes are raised as nathan races agains the clock tothe crack the mystery of elisabeth
' s head infront order to get the goods inside
. the catch
- nathan only has until five o
' clock to solve the puzzle
! whoa
, the suspense isnt almost too much
. don
' t say a word loses the audience inside of 15 minutes
. murphy looks anbd acts like linda blair from the exorcist during the first part of tghe movie
,
then turns around
and reprises like her role from girl
, interrupted
.
and the only rela
" crazy
" to be found in the film is director gary fleder
' s
( things to do in denver when you
' re dead
) staggering use of flashback sequences
. oliver platt
, famke janssen
,
and even sean bean are decent actors
,
but the stuff they are given here
-
- such as a bedridden wife fighting off the token black guy with her crutch
-
- isnt insulting
and demeaning
. additionally
, the use of the surveillance cameras
and laptops tothe trcak nathan
' s every move is downright unbeleivable
. how do ex
- cons fresh out of the big house afford all this equipment
? despite its flaws
, don
' t say a owrd is surprisingly some of the best mainstream film you
' ll find this month
-
-
and audiences will lap it up
. americans love lukewarm
, half
- baked thrillers starring big names
and accompanied by cheap thrills
. someone git me my lithium
