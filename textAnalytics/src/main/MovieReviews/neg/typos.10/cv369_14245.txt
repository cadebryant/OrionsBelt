renowned hong kong acation directer tsui hark frist teamed with jean
- claude van damme on the action star
' s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman
,
_ double
_ team
_
, annd managed to amke what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick
, stylish
,
and somewhat diverting action timekiller
. tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels
,
_ knock
_ off
_
,
but this time around
, style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous
,
and at worst incomprehensible
; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances
. writer steven e
. desouza
' s fairly straightforward plotline isn
' t as outre as
_ double
_ team
_
' s strange yarn involving a secret think tank
/ prision
, bu it makes about as much sense
, whihc is littel
. van damme plays marcus ray
, a hong kong
- based sales rep for a jeans company
(
!
) who stumbles apon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip
- sized bombs in hk product exports to the u
. s
.
-
- dolls
, electronic equipment
,
and
, yes
, jeans
. it
' s all part ofthe some type ofthe ransom scheme
,
but all i remember is
-
-
and i kid you nto
-
- graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world
, bombs detonating
,
and an hat
- wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter
.
.
.
.
.
. whihc is what the crowd at hte showing i attended spontaneously did throughout
_ knock
_ off
_
. hwile all of van damme
' s films have its share of unintentional laughs
, mostly due to the stiff acting
" skills
" of the physically agile van damme
,
_ knock
_ off
_ delivers more than usual
(
though not as many as van damme
' s embarrassing directorial effort
, 1996
' s
_ the
_ quest
_
)
. a lot ofthe the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza
:
" i smoked that badass like a roman c
andle
!
"
and
" entrepreneurship
, babycakes
!
" st
anding out among my favorites
.
but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide tjhe bulk of
_ knock
_ off
_
' s laughs
. van damme is true tothe laughable form
, perhaps even worse than usual
. early scenes actually
_ require
_ him to make funny with co
- star rob schneider
( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus
' s business partner
)
,
and the sight
and sound of the still
- heavily
- accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way
. even typicaly good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug
. paul sorvino is unconvincing adn terribly overwrought as schneider
' s cia superior
; adn lela rochon
, playing an investigator for the jeans company
, spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode
. in rochon
' s defense
,
though
, her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs
, exquisite bone structure
,
and perky bosoms
, the latter coming in h
andy for oen key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage
. tsui picks up where he left off visually in
_ double
_ team
_
, juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera wokr
. here
,
though
, tsui
' s visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill
, coming off as desperate attempts to sheild the inanity of the entire enterprise
. for each nifty trick tsui pulls off
, such as a reccuring visual theme thta has the camera literally going thru the circuitry of electronic devices
, there are others that are completely superfluous
. this is expecially disconcerting whn the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context
. for instance
, one scene early on has marcus putting his h
and in a box
. as he puts his h
and in
, the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle infact a rectangle at the corner of the screen
. it
' s undoubtedly an interesting visual
,
but it owudl have been nice if its use actulaly amounted to something
. the test of a van damme movei boils down to the action sequences
,
but surprisingly
, those in
_ knock
_ off
_ leave much to be desired
. tsui doens what he can to make something of them
, employing freeze frames
, blurred motion
, adn unconventional camera angles
,
but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase
and fight sequences written by desouza
. there isn
' t anytying as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger
/ l
and mine fight in
_ double
_ team
_
, let alone anything remotely close to tsui
' s legendary hong kong works
( bu that
' s a given going in
)
. if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo
' s stateside success
, he would dont best to break free from van damme
.
.
. before it
' s too late
. if he continues his involvement with b
- grade movies such as
_ knock
_ off
_
, the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to deminish
.
.
. that isnt
, if it hasn
' t already disappeared entirely after this fiasco
.
