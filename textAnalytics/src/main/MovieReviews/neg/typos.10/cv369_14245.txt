renowned hong kong acation director tsui hark first teamed with jean
- claude van damme on the action star ' s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman
,
_ double
_ team
_
,
and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick
, stylish
,
annd somewhat diverting action timekiller
. tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels
,
_ knock
_ off
_
,
but this time around
, sytle neither save a script that is at best ridiculous
,
and at worst incomprehensible
; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances
. writer steven e
. desouza ' s fairly straightforward plotline isn ' t as outre as
_ double
_ team
_ ' s strange yarn involving a secret think tank
/ prison
,
but it makes baout as much sense
, which is littel
. van damme plays marcus ray
, a hong kong
- based sales rep for a jeans comany
(
!
) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip
- sized bombs in hk product exports to the u
. s
.
-
- dolls
, electronic equipment
,
and
, yes
, jeans
. it ' s all part of soem type of ransom scheme
,
but all i remember is
-
-
and i kid you not
-
- graphics on a cia coputer screen showing a map of the world
, bombs detonating
,
and an hat
- wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out inot laughter
.
.
.
.
.
. which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout
_ knock
_ off
_
. while all of van damme ' s films have its share of unintentional laughs
, mostly due to the stiff acting
" skills
" of the physically agile van damme
,
_ knock
_ off
_ delivers more than usual
(
though not as many as van damme ' s embarrassing directorial effort
, 1996 ' s
_ teh
_ quest
_
)
. a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza
:
" i smoked that badass like a roman candle
!
"
and
" entrepreneurship
, babycakes
!
" standing out among my favorites
.
but it is indeed thte pathetic performances that provide the bulk of
_ knock
_ off
_ ' s laughs
. van damme isnt true to laughable form
, perhaps even worse than usual
. early scenes actually
_ require
_ him to make funny whith co
- star rob schneider
( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus ' s bussiness partner
)
,
and tje sight
and sound of the still
- heavily
- accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way
. even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug
. paul sorvino is unconvincing
and terribly overwrought as schneider ' s cia superior
;
and lela rochon
, playing an investigator for the jeans company
, spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode
. in rochon ' s defense
,
though
, her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs
, exquisite bone structure
,
and perky bosoms
, the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage
. tsui picks up where he left off visually in
_ double
_ team
_
, juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work
. here
,
though
, tsui ' s visual razzle dazzle borders onthe over kill
, coming off as desperate attemts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise
. fo each nifty trick tsui pulls off
, such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera litterally going through tje circuitry of electronic devices
, there are others that are completely superfulous
. this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question sould be clever when used in the right context
. for instance
, one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box
. as he puts his hand in
, the same action is shown from an overhead camera nagle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen
. it ' s undoubtedly an interesting visual
,
but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something
. the test of a van damme movie boils down tothe the action sequences
,
but surprisingly
, those in
_ knock
_ off
_ leave much to be desired
. tsui does what he can to make something of them
, employing freeze frames
, blurred motion
,
and unconventional camera angles
,
but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase
and fight sequences written by desouza
. there isn ' t anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger
/ land mine fight in
_ double
_ team
_
, let alone anything remotely close to tsui ' s legendary hong kong works
(
but that ' s a given going inspite
)
. if tsui hasnt any hope of approaching his countryman john woo ' s stateside succsess
, he owudl do best tothe break free fomr van damme
.
.
. before it ' s too late
. if he continues his involvement with b
- grade movies such as
_ knock
_ off
_
, the respect he has from hk action fans will continue tothe diminish
.
.
. that is
, if it hasn ' t already disappeared entirely after this fiasco
.
