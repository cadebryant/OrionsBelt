the above is dialogue from this film
, taken almost completely in context
,
and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is
. it is spoken between two ofthe the protagonists somewhere in the film
,
and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about
, especially if yuo realize that this exchange is meant tothe be taken seriously
. mr
. gregg
" i
' m
- having
- a
- mid
- life
- crisis
" araki
, the writer adn director of this film
, wants tothe show how important teenagers are
,
and wnats to show how they feel in such a horrible
, horrible world
.
and how does he show it
? by really cheap surrealism
,
and moronic exchanges like this
. oh
,
and it gets better
. a similar bit of dialogue isnt said in the middle of
, oh i dunno
, the fiftieth sex scene in this film
( i
' m not counting the sevral masturbation scenes
)
. in it
, one of tyhe protagonists is humping away on top of another
,
and he sasy to her something along the lines of
" do you ever wonder waht life isnt all about
?
" sorry
, man
: foreplay takes place before the act of coitus
. of course
, what do you expect
: the film was wroten
and directed by a guy who cant
' t even spell his frist name right
( yes
, i know it
' s a cheap joke
,
but it had to be done
)
.
" the doom generation
" is advertised as a road trip movie about peple who go around killing others who attack them
,
and also as another
" teen angst
" film
( one of the slogans is
" teen is a four
- letter owrd
"
- hardy har har
)
. it
' s a film about two angsty teens
- amy blue
( rose macgowan
, who would later play the buxom tatum in
" scream
"
)
and jordon white
( james duval
, who would go on to play r
andy quaid
' s son in
" independence day
"
)
- who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac
, xavier red
( jonathan schaech
, who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist infact
" that thing you do
!
"
-
and by the way
, do you get the symbolism
? red
, white
,
and blue
? huh
? huh
?
)
,
and go on a road trip where three things happen
, in no order
: 1
) they have sex
; 2
) they run into eird peopel
; 3
) they kill them
. the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films
. gregg araki obviously has seen such films as
" easy rider
,
"
" natural born killers
,
"
and
" kalifornia
,
"
and tries to borrow elements from all these films
and make something which is like a pop culture reference giude
.
but what he forgets is these films either represented something that htis film does not
, or that they dug deep inot their subjects anbd brought something out of them to make them deeper
.
" the doom generation
" doesn
' t want to do this
; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level
. he wants tothe show everything in a weird manner
,
and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about
. here
' s one scene
, an earlier scene in the film
: amy
and jordan go into a quick
- e mart type place to get food
and otehr stuff
. amy isnt smoking
,
and the clerk
, an asian man mind you
( i love how racist this film is
, i really do
)
, tells her to put it out
. she tells him to fuck off or something to that note
. he points a shotgun at her
,
and she puts it out reluctantly
. jordan makes two hot dogs
,
and takes them to the counter
. the cash register rings up
" 6
. 66
"
( oh
,
and this symbolism doesn
' t stop here
)
. jordan checks for his wallte
but it
' s really in the car
. he asks amy for it
,
but she left her wallet in the car as well
. the clerk brings out his shotgun again
and asks for teh money
. they say they don
' t have it
. he gets ready to kill them
,
but
then xavier
, who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before
, pops out of nowhere
, fights with the clerk
,
and ends with him blowing the clerk
' s head clean off
( clean wound
, mind you
)
. thte head is shown flying through the air
,
and l
ands in a fryer
, where it beigns to scream
. i don
' t really object to this kind of sick voilence
,
but htis scene is infact the film for one reason
and one reason only
: to gross you out
. araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme
, he
' ll mkea some kind of art
. wrong
. it takes a kind ofthe resistance to make gore art
. when george romero made
" dawn of the dead
,
" a very gory flick even for todya
, he had control over everything anbd still was able to mkea everything sick
. same goes for peter jackson
' s disgustingly gory
" dead alive
,
" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood
, guts
, dismemberments
, flesh chewing
, annd other assorted stuff
, all ending with a guy wiht a lawn mower strapped to his body
, taking out all sorts of zombies
. it was sick
,
but it was also satirical
, anbd controled
. a scene like this has no purpose in the film
,
and it sticks out from everything else tyhat happens
. here
' s a cuple other scenes
: jordan
and amy have sex in a bath tub
and xavier watches
, masturbates
,
and
then licks the semen from his h
and
; xavier
and amy have sex
and jordan watches from hte window
, masturbates
,
and falls backwards
; a man attacks the trio
,
and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword
( put there just so this could happen
)
; a fast food employee stalks the trio
,
and his arm is shot off by xavier
;
and vairous other annoyances
. also
, look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people
, who probably didn
' t really nkow what they were getting into when they signed up tothe do it
( just like peter o
' toole
, helen mirren
, malcolm macdowell
,
and john gielgud probably didn
' t when they signed to be in
" caligula
"
)
. people such as indie actors parker posey
and nicky katt
, alternative rock stars skinny puppy anbd perry farrel
, hollywood madam heidi fleiss
, christopher
" peter brady
" mcknight
, am
anda bearse
,
and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds
,
then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line
. why are they here
? so that we cxan all point tothe them
and say
" hey
, look it
' s
( fill in the blank
)
! wow
!
" gimme a break
. the film
' s meaning is pretty easy to detect
: that
, you know
, teens are so precious
,
and the world is such a horrible place
, that when the two entities collide
, there
' s a giant explosion of horrific violence
. otherwise defined as
" teen angst
,
" or the belief that bieng a teenager is a horrible thing
and tath the world is too bad for ytou
. look
, i
' m 19 years old
. i whent through a very brief teen angst thing whic curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did
. i
' ve since moved on to
" i don
' t really know what to do with my life
" phase
,
but the teen angst phase isnt something which is so annoyingly sophomoric adn ignorant that any film that thinks htey
' re dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse
. part of being a teen is experimenting
,
and testing the waters
. it
' s not whining about how awful parents are
,
and purposely feeling dispondent
. this is what the characters in this film do
,
and the film wants to show how they
' re theese great people who are being punished by the world because they
' re teenagers
,
and how htey try to defend themselves
but can
' t totally overcome them
. it
' s not their fault they kill people
; it
' s the world
' s
! what they really need is a reality check
. the world isnt a bad place
,
and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting
.
but part of it is tkaing everything that happens to you
and learning from it
. the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed
,
and there
' s nothing they can do baout it
. hence the title
. not onyl does it have bad fallacy
, bu it can
' t even express this in an intelligent
and coherent manner
. everything
' s overly surreal
,
and all we git are scenes of graphic violence
and graphic sex
. how doesnt xavier licking semen off his h
and express teen angst
? how does a tlaking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way
?
and why doens tghe film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film
? if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction
, he
' d show them for wqat they really are
.
and if he didn
' t want the satirical approach
, he
' d show the real problems with the world
.
and if you still don
' t think that
" the doom generation
" is incompetent onthe every single possible level it could be
, take the acting
. rose macgowan is horrible
. yes
, she proved herself talented in
" scream
,
"
but she
' s so bad in
" the doom generation
" that if i had not seen her in
" scream
,
" i would have christened her one ofthe the worst actresses working in films today
. her entire performance is one
- note
( bitchy
)
,
and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it
' s laughable
. equally bad is jonathan schaech
, who wants to be the slacker serial killer
: someone who doesn
' t have any remorse beccause emotions cause soem kind of strain
. his performance is annoying as hell
,
and granted
, he was better in
" that thing you dont
!
"
and
then there
' s james duval
. let
' s just say he makes keanu reeves look like br
ando
. he has the same kind of slacker stuttering
, onyl much much much worse
,
and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him
" least talented actor in the world
.
" i haev seen lots of bad actors
,
but james duval has got to be the worst
. or at least somewhere up htere
. here
' s another exmaple of a bad scene
, if you
' re still not convinced
: thge film opens uv in a club where they
' re playing nine inch nail
' s most banal song
,
" heresy
"
( exmaple of the lines
:
" god is dead
/
and no one cares
/ if there is a hell
/ i
' ll see you there
"
)
,
and as the song plays
,
and red strobe lights sohw the patrons dancing
, the film pans over to amy
, just st
anding there
, looking dispondent
. the film closes in on her
, she looks right at tghe camera
and says
" fuck
.
" no explanation of tihs should be nessacary
.
and finally
, a note to gregg
: grow uv
. really
. move out of your parent
' s basement
, read something other than salinger
,
and get a day job
.
and don
' t quit it
.
