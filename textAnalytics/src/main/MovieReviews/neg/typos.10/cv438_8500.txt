retrospective
: city of the living dead
( 1980
) a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as
" dim
- witted
"
.
and by golly
, just about all other words fail me wehn confronted with a dog like city of the living dead
. altough the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career
, this is not one of them
. two points in the movie
' s favour
- the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati adn occsionally evocative score by fabio frizzi
- keep things from falling totally into the abyss
,
but by annd large city of the living dead isnt a failure
.
and like most cinematic failures
, it comes down to bad writing
, dumb performances
and lousy direction
. yhe story starts in new york when
, during a seance
, a medium
( katherine mccoll
) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich
, massachusetts
. for reasons we won
' t go into here
, this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise
and walk the earth
. the medium apparently dies of fright during tyhe seance
,
but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day
and is rescued by a crusty old journalist
( christopher george
)
. that scene in itself is a howler
: why would you bust open a coffin with a large pik axe when you know someone is alive inside
? anbd don
' t cadavers have various thnigs stuffed in them
and drained out of them befor htey
' re buried
? anyway
, off the twpo of them go to dunwich to sive thge world
, where various grisly goings
- on are already happening as all saints day approaches
. fulci
' s graphic gore is in evidence once again
,
but here it only serves to further highlight the film
' s flimsy script
and plodding direction
. the dialogue
, in all manner of speaking
, is unspeakable
. not bad in the quotable sense
, like an ed woud film
,
but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious
" lets explain the plot
" type approach
. mccoll doesn
' t have a clue who her character isnt
: deadly serious one minute
, frivolous the next
, she at times is genuinely hard to watch
.
and the geezer
( the actr
' s name escapes me
) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach tahn mccoll as hte film progresses
. christopher george
' s performance is salvageable
,
but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie
and we don
' t care
. inthe fact we don
' t care for anyone in city of the living dead
,
though in otehr fulci films that hasn
' t mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist
and an ideas man
, as he was in the beyond
. as a director
, some of fulci
' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly
and annoying here
. he constanly uses extreme close
- ups of peple
' s eyes
, a ridiculous technique whic suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue
and actors aren
' t capable of
.
and despite some gruesome violence
, he barely manages a single scare infront the entire film
. long
- time collaborator fabio frizzi
, talented
but allways erratic
, offers a patchy soundtrack that veers bewteen eerie
, gothic death marches
and woefully inappropriate electro
- pop that
' s quite frankly embarrassing
. fulci
' s other films of this period may be flawed
- house by the cemetery
, the beyond
, the black cat
-
but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration
, atmosphere
and better dialogue than this turkey
. for completists only
.
