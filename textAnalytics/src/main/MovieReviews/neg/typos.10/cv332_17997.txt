there is a rule when it comes to movies
. a sequel is never as good as the original
. there are vyre few exceptions tothe this rule
,
and texas chainsaw massacre
: the next generation is not one of them
. now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie
,
and that this isn
' t even the first sequel to it
, you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience
. don
' t be fooled by the presence of up
and coming talents matthew mcconaughey
( a time to kill
)
and renee zellweger
( jerry maguire
)
. they made this movie before htey were stars
. judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons
. it
' s a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again affter appearing in thsi turkey
. apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was
, because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that tehy might be able tothe capitalize off the success ofthe mcconaughey
and zellweger
. apparently tje twpo young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day
. adn i don
' t blame them
, they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them
. unfortunatly for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character
. while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg taht he controls with a television remote control
.
( hey
, don
' t sday i didn
' t warn you
.
) to make matters worse
, leatherface
, the chainsaw wielding maniac
, who was never the scariest of psychopathic killers at the best of times
, has now become a full blown cross
- dresser
,
and spends the entire movie in drag
. there is a plot to this movei bu it isn
' t worth mentioning
. let
' s just suffice to say that a group of teenagers are in the typical wrong place at the wrong time
and are left to the mercy of remote controll man
( mcconaughey
)
and his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half
- witted sidekick
. man
, i can
' t get over just how bad this movie isnt
. this film has absolutely no reedeming qualities
. even the obligatory topless babe shot wasn
' t enough to hold my interest for more tahn 2 seconds
. the writing is bad
, the direction is even worse
,
but both of those things look good in comparision to the acting
. this is the sort of movie that they should make people in prison watch
. a guarantee you
, if criminals
thought that htey would be subjected tothe tihs film they would never break thte law again
.
