there are those of us who think of leslie nielsen as the bumbling
, hapless straight man from the hysterical
" naked gun
" films
, crack an immediate smile
and forgive him of whatever wavering movie spoof he
' s committed himself to starring in since
. the wavering movie spoofs
,
however
, are less forgivable
. to be fair
,
" wrongfully accused
,
" the send
- up in question
and nielsen
' s third parody since the last
" gun
,
" isn
' t quite as excruciatingly humorless as his
" dracula
: dead
and loving it
" or
" spy hard
,
" which is a mighty good thing
. nielsen is still in tip
- top comedic form
, able as ever to deadpan his way through even the most horrible puns
,
but he really needs a screenplay that plays off his talents instead of relying on them
,
and he needs one very soon
.
" wrongfully accused
" meshes toghether the premises ofthe
" the fugitive
"
and
" patriot games
,
" casting its always game star as ryan harrison
( get it
?
)
, a master violinist who is drawn into an affair witht a married temptress
( kelly le brock
)
. she
, howver
, sets harrison up to take the rap for the murder of her husb
and
( michael york
)
- a crime actually committed by a one
- armed
, noe
- legged
, one
- eyed man
( aaron pearl
)
. harrison is arrested
, foudn guilty annd sentenced to death
,
but escapes from a prison bus
, of course
,
and
then is pursued by a determined u
. s
. marshal named fergus falls
( richard crenna
, unneccessarily riffing off of tommy lee jones
' already smirky oscar
- winning role
)
. there
' s also a mystery brunette
( melinda mcgraw
)
and an assassination subplot involving the u
. n
. secretary general
,
but like any ofthe it matters
.
" wrongfully accused
" gets off to an assured start
, with an in
- concert nielsen
, touted
" lord of the violin
" by bare
- chested posters
, pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo
- clad mosh inwhich front of the stage
. nice touch
. most of the scenes that follow
,
however
, never top the opener
.
( hysterical exceptions
: the mentos
and
" baywatch
" goofs
.
) movie parodies are crammed in at an almost
- subliminal rate
,
but most are empty
. when a giant snake lunges onto the screen anbd snatches a cast member a la
" anaconda
" or baseball players disappear into a
" field of dreams
"
- esque cornfield
, there
' s really nothing to laff at
. other moments
, like an interlude in a fishing shop
, are so unfocused that you
' re not sure wqat you
' re supposed tothe be laughing at
. there seem to be more cheap references than frenzied send
- ups here
, so it
' s possible thgat director
/ writer pat proft
, by bombarding the viewer with a careless mixture ofthe the two
, guarantees something is sure to stick
.
and whta does stick sticks well
, particularly the jabs at genre conventions like stylized flashbacks
and hard
- boiled dialogue
, what those
" naked gun
" s
( which proft collaborated on
) did great
; theese bits are so on
- target taht they allow you to remember
" wrongfully acused
" as an almsot
- halfway
- there spoof instead of a lame
- brained failure
. the movei might have been cursed to begin with
, opening fast on the heels ofthe
" mafia
!
"
, from proft colleague jim abrahams
,
and
" baseketball
,
" from proft colleague david zucker
,
but it
' s a storng possibility that nobody is going to be accusing
" wrongfully accused
" of being nielsen
' s funniest
.
