because no one demanded it
: david duchovny in a romantic comedy
! at last
, both his romantic magnetism
and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources
! tjhe choice of duchovny may hve something to do with the plot
, hwihc could be fodder for a valentine ' s day episode of
" the x
- files
.
" bob rueland
( david duchovny
) loses his wife elizabeth
( joely richardson
) in a car accident
. at the same time
, grace briggs
( minnie driver
) is in the hospital
, waiting for a heart transplant
. grace gets elizabeth ' s heart
,
and it leads her to bob
. it ' s thge romantic equivalent of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer
and
then is driven to slaughter people
. four writers are credited wiht contributing to the stroy
. tht doesn ' t seem possible
. despite being a solid two hours long
,
" return to me
" adds little to the
" boy meets girl
/ boy loses girl
" formula
and
, as a result
, is terribly tedeous
and slow
- moving
. duchovny
and driver seem unable to generate any sparks
,
adn i kept wishing for a fast
- forward button to move their scenes along
. since driver has managed to work well in romantic roles before
, i blame duchovny
. he ' s out of his element wihtout the manufactured
and static sexual tension ofthe his tv series
(
and i ' ve always thought that the relationship between mulder
and scully on
" tyhe x
- files
" comes off more sibling
- like than hot
-
and
- bothered
)
. there ' s something about duchovny that makes me uneasy
. regardless of thte role he ' s playing
, he comes off as a weirdo
. the only redeeming quality ofthe
" return to me
" isnt its hilarious supporting cast
. the circle of friends
and relatives around bob
and grace is constanly playing matchmaker
,
annd they generate the onyl laughs in the movie
. carroll o ' connor is grace ' s granfather marty o ' reilly
. when bob comes into marty ' s restaurant after hours
, marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status
. when marty discovers that bob is a widower
, he invites bob to join his poker game
and introduces him with the declaration
,
" this is bob
! his wife is dead
!
" the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate fo grace
and greet bob enthusiastically when they hear teh news
. also funny
: bonnie hunt as grace ' s best friend megan
and james belushi as megan ' s husband joe
. married with children
, megan
and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance
. altho it ' s rare to see him in a movei that premieres in a theater
, belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill
. rounding outloud the impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob ' s best friend
and robert loggia as marty ' s brother
- infact
- law angelo
. in only the lead actors lived up to the standards set by the rest of the cast
. bottom line
: if you are compelled to see this movie
, watch it on video so you can fast
- forward to scenes iwth carroll o ' connor
and james belushi
.
