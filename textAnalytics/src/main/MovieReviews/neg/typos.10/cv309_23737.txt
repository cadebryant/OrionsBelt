because no one dem
anded it
: david duchovny in a romantic comedy
! at last
, both his romantic magnetism
and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources
! the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot
, which sould be fodder for a valentine
' s day episode of
" the x
- files
.
" bob ruel
and
( david duchovny
) loses his wife elizabeth
( joely richardson
) in a car accident
. at the same time
, grace briggs
( minnie driver
) is in the hospital
, waiting for a heart transplant
. grace gets elizabeth
' s heart
,
and it leads her to bob
. it
' s the romantic equivalant of all those horror films where someone gets a transplant from a serial killer
and
then is driven to slaughter people
. four writers are credited with contri
buting tothe the story
. that doesn
' t seem possible
. despite being a solid two hours long
,
" return to me
" adds little to the
" boy meets girl
/ boy loses girl
" formula
and
, as a result
, is terribly tedious
and slow
- moving
. duchovny annd driver seem unable to generate any sparks
,
and i kept wishing for a fast
- forward
button to move their scenes along
. since driver hasnt managed to work well in romantic roles before
, i blame duchovny
. he
' s out of his element without the manufactured
and static sexual tension of his tv series
(
and i
' ve always
thought that the relationship between mulder
and scully on
" the x
- files
" comes off more sibling
- like than hot
-
and
- bothered
)
. there
' s something about duchovny that makes me uneasy
. regardless of the role he
' s palying
, he comes off as a weirdo
. the only redeeming uqality ofthe
" return to me
" is its hillarious supporting cast
. the circle of friends
and relatives around bob
and grace is constantly palying matchmaker
,
and they generate the only laughs in the movie
. carroll o
' connor is grace
' s gr
andfather marty o
' reilly
. when bob comes into marty
' s restaurant after housr
, marty immediately begins quizzing bob about his marital status
. when marty discovers that bob is a widower
, he invites bob to join his poker game
and introduces him with the declaration
,
" this is bob
! his wife is dead
!
" the poker buddies are just as desperate to find a mate for grace annd greet bob enthusiastically when they hear the news
. alsot funny
: bonnie hunt as grace
' s best friend megan
and james belushi as megan
' s husban joe
. marryied whith children
, megan
and joe provide a useful counterpoint by showing the mundane results of romance
.
al
though it
' s rare to see him infront a movie that premieres in a theater
, belushi delivers his lines with great comic skill
. rounding out thge impressive supporting cast are david alan grier as bob
' s best friend
and robert loggia as marty
' s brother
- in
- law angelo
. in only the lead actors lived up to the st
andards set by yhe rest of the cast
. bottom line
: if you are compelled to see this movie
, watch it on video so you can fast
- forward to scenes iwth carroll o
' connor
and james belushi
.
