i ' m not sure who the genuis is who came up wih the idea of comparing
" disturbing behavior
" wiht
" scream
.
" maeby it ' s becasue they ' re both horror films
( kinda
)
, both have hot young stars
, both have an annoying alternative soundtrack
,
and both are aimed at the teenage crowd
, which i guess includes me
.
bu this is nto the next in line with the
" scream
" flicks as well as tjhe
" i know what you doed last summer
" soon to be flicks
. it owes less to
" halloween
"
adn more to kafka
and orwell
, which
, in my book
, makes for a mroe interesting feature
.
and it should ahev been
. this is basically a rehash of
" the stepford wives
,
" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross
anbd dealing
, as i ' ve been told
, wih a bunch of women who are programmed to be perfect housewives
. or something like that
.
" behavior
,
" starring katie holmes of
" dawson ' s creek
,
" deals with a bunch of teenagers
, deep in angst
, who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers
. suck
- ups
. preppies
. it actually
, at least tothe me
, sounds like it would work
,
and with scott rosenberg
, that witty penmen who hasnt written stuff like
" beautiful girls
"
and
" things to do in denver when ytou ' re dead
"
( as well as
" con air
"
)
, it actually sounds like it may be pulled off with the right amount of frights
anbd satiric wit
. alas
, it ' s not
,
and it plumets into that little group of movies known as
" the movies with potential that blow it
.
" i remember a film called
" white man ' s burden
" which dealt whith a reversal of blacks
and whites in society that did nothing with it ' s potentially brilliant premise
. here ' s another one
. it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order tothe find themselves
. it ' s a stage
,
and this film does in fact relize that
. it gets its message across
adn it does it effortlessly
. now it just needs to work as a film
. which it doesn ' t
. it ' s too sloppy
and too contrived
. it paints a bleak portrait of high school life
.
.
.
then lets it lie
. it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss
- ups who do food drives
and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes
.
.
.
then gives it a cheap twist
: when they get horny
, they become homicidal
. isn ' t it scary enough that they ' re like this
,
and cxan ' t the real terror in the town be that ytou could be next to be just like them
- not that you could be next to die
? the film introduces us two three different characters who
, in the beginning
, are consdiered outsiders because they ' re not
(
yet
) part of this clique
: the new kid
, steve
( james marsden
- dull dull dull dull
)
, who ' s having trouble at hmeo because he hasn ' t gotten over his brother ' s
( ethan embry
, in quick flashes so you don ' t recognize him
- i did
) suicide
; the renegade girl
, rachel
( katie holmes
, from
" dawson ' s creek
"
)
, who ' s chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring
;
and by far hte most interesting kid
, gavin
( nick stahl
, the kid from
" the man without a face
"
)
, who ' s the most interesting because he ' s the only character who ' s given some dimension
. in the film ' s best scene
, he introduces steve tothe every single clique
, nailing each one ' s fetishes
and hang
- ups
,
and it ' s the best scene in the movie because it ' s witty
, satirical
,
and interesting
- something tghe rest ofthe this film isn ' t
. gavin suspects there ' s something awry with the preppie kids
, known as the blue ribbons
,
and inaddition the tradition of all conspirators
,
and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve
, he ' s only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff
. here
, we have another case of
" tjhe idiot plot
,
" where not only could steve had done something about gavin
and what happens to him
,
but he may hvea saved tihs film from being the dreary
, dull film that it is without gavin
, who gives it life
and humor
. the only other half
- intresting character is the skool janitor
, played by william sadler as a retarded
, scary guy who may not be what he seems tothe be
.
.
.
but really
, we don ' t care anyway
. i probably shouldn ' t mention that this was directed by david nutter
, who ' s works for
" the x
- files
,
" because thta would probably tarnish his reputation
. like the show
, he ' s good at setting up weird conspiracies
,
and creating a general creepy feel
. most of htis film is shot at nigt
anbd with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect
,
and some of it works
.
but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff
. he keesh too much inside
, so much that when the charactors journey to a mental institution in thge third act
, you wonder why they just don ' t get the hell out ofthe there
. i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there ' s something rotten in the state of teen angstdom
. whta this film needs to be is a lot longer
, a lot moreso colorful
,
and a lot creepier
. if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor
( played by bruce greenwood
, an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent
) who still thinks he can get away with it even wehn most is revealed
,
then they need to come up with a tougher
, smarter villain
. if he ' s so villainous
,
then why could two dense teenagers who couldn ' t figure out there was something going onthe nutil it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes
? the film
, whihc runs baout 80 or so minutes
, jstu needs to work on these things
,
and become a lot less sloppy
. at such a short running time
and with such lame
, boring characters as these
, it ' s pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied tast in one ' s mouth
, especially mine
.
