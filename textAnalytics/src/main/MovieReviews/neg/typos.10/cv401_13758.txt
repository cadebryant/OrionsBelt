i
' m not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing
" disturbing behavior
" with
" scream
.
" maybee it
' s because they
' re both horror films
( kinda
)
, both have hot young stars
, both have an annoying alternative soundtrack
,
and both are aimed at the teenage crowd
, which i guess includes me
.
but this is not the enxt in line withthe thte
" scream
" flicks as well as the
" i know what you doed last summer
" soon to be flicks
. it owes less to
" halloween
" anbd more to kafka
and orwell
, which
, in my book
, makes for a more interesting feature
.
and it shoudln hvae beeen
. this is basically a rehash of
" the stepford wives
,
" the great 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross adn dealing
, as i
' ve been told
, with a bunch of women who are programmed tothe be perfect housewives
. or something like that
.
" behavior
,
" starring katie holmes ofthe
" dawson
' s creek
,
" deals with a bunch of teenagers
, deep inaddition angst
, who are being programmed to be perfect teenagers
. suck
- ups
. preppies
. it atcually
, at least to me
, sounds like it would work
,
and with scott rosenberg
, that witty penmen who has written stuff like
" beatiful girls
"
and
" thnigs to do in denver when you
' re dead
"
( as well as
" con air
"
)
, it actually sounds like it may be pulled off whith the right amount of frights
and satiric wit
. alas
, it
' s nto
,
and it plumets into that little group of movies known as
" the movies with potential that blow it
.
" i remember a film called
" white man
' s burden
" which dealt with a reversal of blacks
and whites in society that did nothing with it
' s potentially brilliant premise
. here
' s another one
. it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves
. it
' s a stage
,
and this film doens in fact realize that
. it gets its message across
and it doens it effortlessly
. now it just needs tothe work as a film
. whic it doesn
' t
. it
' s too sloppy
and too contrived
. it paints a bleak portrait of high school life
.
.
.
then lets it lie
. it brings us a bunch ofthe scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss
- ups who dont food drives
and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes
.
.
.
then gives it a cheap twist
: when they get horny
, they become homicidal
. isn
' t it scary enough thta they
' re like this
,
and can
' t the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them
- not that you sould be next to die
? the film introduces us two three diffrent characters who
, in the beginning
, are considered outsiders because they
' re not
( yot
) part of thsi clique
: the new kid
, steve
( james marsden
- dull dull dull dull
)
, who
' s having trouble at home because he hasn
' t gotten over his brother
' s
( ethan embry
, in quick flashes so yuo don
' t recognize him
- i did
) suicide
; the renegade girl
, rachel
( katie holmes
, from
" dawson
' s creek
"
)
, who
' s chief personality trait is her prominate nose ring
;
and by far the most interesting kid
, gavin
( nick stahl
, the kid from
" the man without a face
"
)
, who
' s the most intresting because he
' s the only character who
' s given smoe dimension
. infront the film
' s best scene
, he introduces steve to eveyr single clique
, nailing each one
' s fetishes
and hang
- ups
,
and it
' s thge best scene in the movie because it
' s witty
, satirical
,
and interesting
- something the rest of this film isn
' t
. gavin suspects there
' s something awry with the preppie kids
, known as the blue ribbons
,
and in the tradition of all conspirators
,
and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve
, he
' s only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff
. here
, we have another case of
" the idiot plot
,
" where not only could steve had done something baout gavin
and what happens to him
,
but he may have saved this film from being thge dreary
, dull film that it is without gavin
, who gives it life
and humor
. the only otehr half
- interesting character is the school janitor
, played by william sadler as a retarded
, sacry guy who may not be what he seems to be
.
.
.
but really
, we don
' t care anyway
. i probably shouldn
' t mention that this was directed by david nutter
, who
' s works for
" the x
- files
,
" because that would probably tarnish his reputation
. like the show
, he
' s good at setting up weird conspiracies
,
and creating a general creepy feel
. most of this film isnt shot at ngiht
and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect
,
and some of it works
.
but what this film is not so good at is coming out wtih a good payoff
. he keeps too much inside
, so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act
, you wonder why they just don
' t get the hell out of there
. i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there
' s something rotten in the state of teen angstdom
. what this film needs to be is a lot longer
, a lot more colorful
,
and a lot creepier
. if the best villain they can come up with isnt a guidance counselor
( palyed by bruce greenwood
, an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay teh rent
) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed
,
then they need to come up with a tougher
, smarter villain
. if he
' s so villainous
,
then why could twpo dense teenagers who couldn
' t figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes
? the film
, which runs about 80 or so minutes
, just needs to work on these thigns
,
and become a lot less sloppy
. at such a short running time
and with such lame
, boring characters as these
, it
' s pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one
' s mouth
, especially mine
.
