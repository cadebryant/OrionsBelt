yet anohter brainless teen flick
, htis one isnt about
, surprise
, drugs
and sex
. stars katie holmes
and sarah polly couldn
' t look moreso bored
. their charachters are cardboard cut
- outs of every cliched teenager out there
. one thing you ened to know is i really hated tihs movei
. everything about it annoyed the hell out of me
. the acting
,
and script
, the plot
,
and endig
. the director
( of tyhe fluke hit swingers
) could have very well directed a bunch of no
- nmae actors
and had a watchabe film
. the
" big
" stars of go pretty much drown the project of any originality
. i felt like i wass watching dawson
' s creek episode 200
.
al
though the film still would have stayed at red despite its cast
. the
" surprise
" ending was sooo predictable
. since when is a male character
' s sudden outing of the closet considered a surprise in hollywood anymore
?
? go is dawson
' s creek
+ varsity blues
- she
' s all that
= go home
and watch something else
.
