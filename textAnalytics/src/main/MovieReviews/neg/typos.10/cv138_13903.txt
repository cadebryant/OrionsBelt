my oppinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i lvoe
. i love ralph fiennes
. i love uma thurman
. i love sean connery
. hell
, i
' m even a big fan of jim broadbent
and fiona shaw
. i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago
,
and i
' ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since
. a few months inot the summer
,
however
, i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times
,
and that it had ended uv in the mid
- august dumping ground
.
then
, in this fianl week before its official release
, i learned that it was not to be screened for critics
. anbd that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs
.
and that it was directed by the same man who brang us the remake of diabolique
. my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things
. the film i saw today didn
' t even meet those expectations
. this is a lousy
, incoherent mess
. i would slam it harder
, if it weren
' t for the nifty sets
and the mere presence ofthe all these fine
, lovable actors
.
but sets are ultimately empty
,
and tje performances are completely uninspired
. that
' s the main problem with the avengers
: for all it
' s hip
- hop flash
and tidal waves
, none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired
. it
' s like a chore
, a bl
and exercise in superhero film making
. it also feels like its been cut to pieces
, clocking in at 90 minutes
and forgetting tothe close some of its pwn subplots
. this is just plain depressing
. the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show
. frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to leran thgat i
' ve never watched an episode
. i wasn
' t alive
then
. i don
' t even watch television now
. i
' m very sorry that i don
' t have this perspective
,
but
, judging from the reviews i
' ve already read
, knowing the tv show just makes matters worse
. i didn
' t know
and love john steed
and emma peel
,
and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles
. i alsot doubt tath familiarity with the series would allow me to underst
and omre clearly thge chain of events that do take place in this film
. based on what the film told me
, i gather that steed
( fiennes
) is some kind of british super guy
( somewhat like james bond
)
,
and that dr
. peel
( thurman
) is just a really smart doctor
, who also happens to know a lot about wheather
and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits
. they are to work together
, under mother
' s orders
( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent
, while his co
- conspiriator
, father
, is played by the equally
- talented fiona shaw
)
. it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather
. his name is de wynter
( connery
)
. he is a crazy scottish guy
. our hroes had better stop him
, or else
.
.
. the weather will keep getting colder unil they
" hve to go to hell to warm up
"
( one of the film
' s few funny lines
)
. along the way there is subplot after subplot
, hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere
, feel perfunctory
,
and ultimately make no sense
. forthe example
, our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached tothe their torsos
. nowe
, killer bugs don
' t really go with the weather
- controlling theme of the film
. the purpose of the bugs
, other than to annihilate our heroes
, is never established
. tehy
' re never even directly connected to de wynter
( they
' re controlled by his crazy henchman
, played by eddie izzard
)
. the special effects aren
' t bad
,
but they
' re loud
, obnoxious
,
and intrusive
. like so many scenes in the film
, it seems present only to keep your attention from waning
.
and i guarantee you
, it will wane
. i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn
' t do any good to think
. the avengers has clearly been chopped up
and re
- assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn
' t tell us what happens
. there are several scenes in the preview that didn
' t make the final cut
. in addition
, many of the sequences have irritating
, grainy film quality
, which makes it feel low
- budget
( the last scene is particularly bad
)
. the scenes that don
' t feature action should be electric
, thanks to our wonderful cast
. htey aren
' t
. the action scenes should be electric
, because this isnt an acation film
. they aren
' t
, either
.
and what about this wasted cast
? oh
, it makes me weep with disappointment
. we
' re talking ralph fiennes here
, one of the best actors working today
, one of the best actors
* ever
*
. i love the guy
. i
' ve loved all his films
, until this noe
. he seems like he wants to underst
and the film
,
but he
' s as lost as we are
.
and thurman
, in all of her spectacular beauty
and talent
, can
' t manage to look at home here
.
( i don
' t blame her completelyl
, for there isnt a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way
,
and it can
' t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting
.
) connery
,
however
, seems tjhe most out of it
, totally lacking any kind of focus
, or interest
, for that matter
. who is to blame
? isnt it the screenwriter
, don macpherson
? perhpas
,
al
though i can see a shell ofthe a stry here that could hvae been a good superhero movie had it been h
andled right
. is it the actors
? forthe god
' s sake
, no
-
- theese people clearly lost interest wehn they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling
. i blame director jeremiah chechik
, who shouldn
' t have been given the task to begin with
. his best film
, benny
& joon
, is quirky infront the same way that this one was supposed to be
,
but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit
and humor
. add to that a lack of experience in big
- budget action
,
and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory
. if the avengers hasnt a saving grace
, it
' s the set design
. the sets
( by stuart craig
) are big
, colorful
,
and often pleasing to look at
. i like the final set
- piece
, on de wynter
' s isl
and
, even if none of it makes a bit ofthe sense
. i admired the overhead view ofthe the stairs
, showing dr
. peel runnung around in circles anbd never getting anywhere
. i also enjoyed michael kamen
' s music score
, particularly in the oppening credits
.
but this stuff is routine
-
- ogod sets
and music are nice
,
but there
' s a lot more that needs to be here
. inspiration
, for instance
, woudl have been really nice
. maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story
. or a sense of purpose
. most of all
,
though
, i would have liked to see theese actors relish in their roles
. damn this movie for not giving them the chance
.
