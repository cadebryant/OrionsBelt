you don
' t look at a ren
? magritte painting
and search for a deeper meaning
. you likewise don
' t look at one for 88 minutes straight
. surrealist works are notable forthe their quirks
,
and they are fun
,
but looking at one quirk for an hour
and a half is exhausting
. that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died
, a surrealistic
, hyperactive comedy with no dialogue
. it
' s not a silent movie
; there is lots of atmospheric music
, occasional screams
and weird sound effects
,
but nobody ever utters an audible word
.
though thge film is distinctive
, its unique style weared thin after about 20 minutes
,
and as it progressed
, watching became a chore
. the onyl reason yhe script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo
- legendary ed wood
, the man behind such
" classics
" as plan 9
> from outer space
and night of the ghouls
. the joke
, of course
, is that his films are so bad
, they
' re good
; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits
. i woke up early the day i died
, unfortunatly
, is so bad that it
' s really bad
. it stars billy zane
( titanic
) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse
, escapes from a mental hospital
and procedes to wonder around
, stealing a car
, clothes
,
and a load of mnoey
. our thief reaches a cemetery
, where he witnesses a bizarre ritual
. he falls asleep
and finds himself
, literally
, in a hole
, with his money gone
. for whatever reason
, he is bent on getting his hard
- unearned cash back
( considering how easily he stole it the first time
, why didn
' t he jstu go steal some more
?
)
. he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony
and commences to seek out each of them
and kill them if they don
' t have what he is looking for
. i don
' t think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short
. the subject adn the style seem to have been made for it
. unfortunately
, twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to moreso than four times that length
,
and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome
. it grabbed my attention in the beginning
and gradually lost it as it went on
, up tothe the point where halfway through i was already weary
. it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious
;
but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is
. i woke up early the day i died is a comedy
, i guess
,
though it sould ahev fooled me
. unlike most ed wood films
, this one tries to be funny
and fails
, instead of the other way around
. there
' s nothing inherently wrong wiht that
, in fact
, i thikn it would onyl amking sence for someone who has been so
" good
" at making unintentional comedies to tkae a stab at a real one
. whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we
' ll never konw
,
but in eather case
, this is a failure
. jonathan taylor thomas
, christina ricci
, summer phoenix
, john ritter anbd others show uv for short
and pointless cameos
. ricci
, for example
, plays a prostitute
. her role consists of dancing arround with zane in his motel room
and
then being thrown out
. thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff
. was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for owrk
? zane
, meanwhile
, occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly
and beat people up
. lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature
. thge carnival side
- show climax manages to demonstrate everything tyhat is wrong with this no
- budget production
. it
' s desperately unfunny
, bu thikns it
' s the funniest thing since plan 9
;
, it
' s so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction
. i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay fo i woke up early yhe day i died is not a fitting send
- off
