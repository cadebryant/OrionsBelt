it
' s actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i
: the phantom menace
, because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful littel comedy
.
and no
, i relaly don
' t feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box
- office
. really
, i don
' t
. not at all
. the plot has been done before
-
- a mysterious
, unaddressed love letter shows uv in a small town
, causing confusion for everyone who reads it
. the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen
( kate capshaw
,
and by thge way
, what is it with bookstore owner main characters
? infront the past year
and a half we
' ve seen them in life is beautiful
, you
' ve got mail
, this movie
,
and the upcoming notting hill
)
, who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore
. she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from
,
and comes to the
( incorrect
) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott
. he
, reading the letter himself
, assumes that she wrote it for him
. after a while
, they fall in love
( well
, duh
)
. kate feels guilty baout getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her
, anbd she also feels guilty because at the same time she is allso involved with the town fireman
( tom selleck
)
. to add to her turmoil
, her mother shows uv
( blythe danner
, who apparently must have hadnt her daughter when she was about 9
)
and her trusted bookstore manager
( deadpan ellen degeneres
) quits
. supporting characters aren
' t called supporting for nothing
. their purpose isn
' t just to move the plot along
, they
' re also supposed to give the storyline a backbone
. to do this
, they must exhibit at least marginal depth
and must also be interesting
. rarely can a movie work if it puts an intresting protagonist in tjhe middle
and surounds her with hackneyed
, dull
, cardboard secondary charactors
, especially when at the core ofthe the movie is the protagonist
' s various interactions with them
. this is the love letter
' s damning error
. capshaw
' s character is as good as i have seen present in recent rumatic comedies
,
but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one
- dimensional
. because ofthe that
, tyhe lveo letter is awkward
and insincere
. even worse
-
- it
' s a bore
. i liked capshaw
and her helen
,
but everyone else is painfully fake
, undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist
. there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either
-
-
and besides degeneres
' wisecracks
, there
' s little thta is even a little amusing
. this is nto a completely
thoughtless film
and director peter ho
- sun chan does a good job ofthe portraying helen
' s yearnings anbd various subtle complexities
.
but it
' s far from profound
. there isn
' t a common theme runnung thru the proceedings
, thus the movie seems
thoughtfully pointless
. really
, tihs is a harmless little movie
; it
' s far from an abomination
and it
' s not torturous to sit thru
.
but bad
, it is
. awful
, it also is
. the love letter is a failure
,
and an inane failure at that
