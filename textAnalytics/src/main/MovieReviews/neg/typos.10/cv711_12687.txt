some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door
, some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time
. playing god asks just one simple
, eensy
, teensy thing so it can fully entertain you
, it
' s accomplished in jsut four easy to follow steps
: crack open your skull
, scoop out your brain
, squish it under your foot several times
and reverse steps two
and one
. congratulations
, you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing
. some movies fail at the box office
but you manage to see why the producers
thought it coudl have beeen a ogod movie
, others are simply good ideas that are badly excecuted
.
then there
' s playing god
, which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem tothe have grown from the union of a drunk directer
, actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick iwll have no lasting impact on their careers
and a bunch of rip
- offs
( or homages as they like to call it
) from other
, better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet
. harsh
? maybe
. justified
? hell yes
! htis is a movie that is nto just satisfied in ripping off other movies bu feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes
. for example
, a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his h
ands firing awya
. this does look moderately kool
,
but the camera lingers on the actor forthe so long yuo can almost hear the director yelling
:
" oooh
, look look
! john woo
! two guns blazing
! slooooow motion
!
"
and if that wasn
' t enough
, you can also hear the script grunting under the efort it must take to try
and make every single line ofthe dialogue sound like something deep
and meaningful like in a tarantino movie
. poor timothy hutton gets to deliver most of the corny lines
, you have to admire the effort he puts into it
, this guy deserves better
. unlike most movies htis one does not suffer from
" stupid bad guy
" syndrome
, just to make things a little different this time we get stupid heroes
. example
: duchovny manages to distract a bad guy by making him go into the bathroom to get some b
andages
. now the bad guy is
, like
, stoned
, man
, so he leaves his shotgun next to our hero
.
( term used as loosely as possible
) survival instincts
and a ogod dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun
, which our hero does
,
but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds
. even when he doens grab it he seems unsure how to hold it
, going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger
. mind you
, i
' ve never fired a shotgun in my life
but believe you me that thge bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs
, be he stoned or not
. some will argue that our hero doesnt not have a killer instinct
, thte hell with that
! two fbi guys have just beeen shot in front me
, along with one bad guy
and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second
. solution
? boom
! i
' ll take the time to feel sorry baout it later thank you very much
. another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome
: our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her
. he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building
and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers
. he still hasnt his shotgun
, bring it along you say
? no thanks
, i
' ll just ditch it in the back of my car
.
and the real kicker is this
: when he reaches the room
and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised
! while we are on the subject of getting shot
, why inwhich hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door
? i
' ve got no formal training
but even i know you never sit with your back to the door
. ask mr
. wild bill
, the first annd only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life
. this is teh major problem with this movie
, any mook could have
thought ofthe a hundered ways to mkea it better
. is it so much to ask thyat hollywood actually put a little common sense inot their characters
? for instance
: our herose hide at duchovny
' s summer home
, now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment
. ok
, this time our hero does get himself a gun
and has it at his side most of the tiem
.
but see
, our hero is a drug addict
and guess wqat
? he chooses now to go clean
and suffer through dt
. oh sure
, he
' ll be realy impressive when the bad guys come calling
. going clean is really honorable of him
,
but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able tothe fire a gun
. for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton
, plot holes the size of godzilla
, getting our intelligene insulted
and several
" oh come on
!
" moments
.
