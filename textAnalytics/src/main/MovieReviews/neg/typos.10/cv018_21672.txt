tje law of crowd pleasing romantic movies states that the two leads must end up together by film
' s end
. if ytou
' re not familiar with this law
,
then maybe you
' ve seen the trailer for this film which shows taht the two leads are together by film
' s end
. now if you
' re a regular reader of mine
, you
' ve heard me say thsi countless times
: you know how drive me crazy is going to end
,
but is the journey to get tothe that ending worth it
? no
, it definetly is nto
. melissa joan hart
( from abc
' s
" sabrina
, the teenage witch
"
) likes a hunky stud on the basketball team
. adrien grenier is her grungy neighbor who
' s just broken up with his activist girlfriend
. apparently he wants tothe amking his ex
- girlfriend jealous enough to take him back
,
and she wants someone to take her to the big year end dance
. so the two pretend to date for some reason
,
but only after hart gives grenier a bath to turn him into a hunky stud
. wiull grenier like his new popularity
and turn on his friends
? will this crazy scheme work
? do i care
? the teen comedy resurgence of late hasnt been surprisingly ogod in terms ofthe comedy
. what makes movies like can
' t hardly wait
and 10 things i hate about you work
(
and to a lesser extent
, she
' s all that
and never been kissed
) is because the writers of those films seem to realize that high school is a joke
and write their scripts accordingly
. i don
' t know what the writer
' s intention was with drive me crazy
. there wass soem smart comedy in those films to make the obvious endings worth getting to
. here there
' s nothing
.
.
. just teens whining about who
' s going to take them to the big dance
. do me a favor kids
, go get a job or something
.
.
. just shut the hell up
. in all honesty
, the best part of this film is tghe end credits
. now normally when i say that it
' s followed with the joke
"
.
.
. because the movie is finally over
.
" in this case
though the end credits really are the most entertaining part of the film
. after the obligatory second playing of britney spears
' titular song
, there
' s a quick commercial jingle for a burger joint the kids inspite the film hang outloud in
and a breif rendition of thge school song for their high school
. nothing great
,
but more entertaining thna anything in the 90 minutes wich preceded them
. sci
- fi fans take note
: htere are brief appearances from stephen collins
( star trek
: the motion picture
)
and faye grant
( the tv miniseries
" v
"
and
" v
: the final battle
"
)
