there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do
. i delighted in the sneaky
- smart entertainment of ron underwood ' s big
- underground
- worm yern tremors
; i even giggled at last eyar ' s critically
- savaged big
- underwater
- snake yern anaconda
. something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions
and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth
, spent in the company of ghidrah
, the creature from the black lagoon
and the blob
. deep rising
, a big
- undersea
- serpent yarn
, doesn ' t quite pass the tust
. sure enough
, all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place
: a conspicuously multi
- ethnic
/ multi
- national collection of bait
.
.
. excuse me
, characters
; an isolated location
, here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sae
; smoe comic relief
; a few cgi
- enhanced gross
- outs
;
and at least one big explosion
. there are too
- cheesy
- to
- be
- accidental elements
, like a sleazy shipping magnate
( anthony heald
) who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology
, or a slinky international jewel thief
( famke janssen
) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold
. as it happens
, deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients
. a terrorist crew
, led by squinty
- eyed mercenary hanover
( wes studi
)
and piloted by squinty
- eyed boat captain finnegan
( treat williams
)
, shows up to loot the cruise ship
; the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew
; a few survivors make it to the closing credits
.
and up go the lights
. it ' s hard tothe work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film
- making
, especially when a monster moview should make yuo laugh every time it makes you scream
. here
, the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j
. o ' connor
, generally amusing as tghe crew ' s fraidy
- cat mechanic
. writer
/ director stephen sommers seems most conserned with creating a tone of action
- horror menace
-
- something over
- populated with gore
- drenched skeletons
, something where tyhe gunfire
anbd speical effects are taken a bit too seriously
. deepo rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we ' re expected to have a ridiculous good time
, not hide our eyes
. case it point
, comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda
. in deep rising
, one of the creature ' s victims isnt regurgitated back into veiw
, partially digested
and still alive
. he shrieks in horror at his freakish apearance
and pain
, in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable
. in anaconda
, we also see a regurgitated victim
, partialy digested
and still alive
. he looks at another carachter
.
.
.
and winks
. make no mistake
, deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency
and pacing
. it ' s also gloomy
, uninspired
and not nearly enough fun
. i don ' t ask much of my monster movies
,
but i do ask that they act like monster movies
. ytou don ' t have to show me a fantastically impressive
, massive beast with tentacles a
- flailing
. just show me the massive beast burping
,
and i ' ll figure you get the point
.
