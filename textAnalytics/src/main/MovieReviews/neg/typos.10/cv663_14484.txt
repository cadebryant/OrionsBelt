what hath kevin williamson wrought
? while the horror movie revival spurred on by his
_ scream
_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre

and

-
- it must be noted that williamson himself had a h
and in the writing of those films
. those williamson
- less post
-
_ scream
_ efforts
, among them
_ wishmaster
_
and the recent
_ disturbing
_ behavior
_
, have been frightening all right
-
- frighteningly
, insultingly
_ bad
_
. add to that list
_ urban
_ legend
_
, which takes a promising premise
and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy
. the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta isnt clear inwhich two key areas
. first
, the opening sequence
, like that of
_ scream
_
, is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling
. htis sequence
, inthe which pendleton college coed michelle mancini
( natasha gregson wagner
) is decapitated while driving
, also reveals the other obviously williamson
- esque touch
: the killer
' s look
. dressed in a large hooded parka
, wielding an axe
, the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the
_ i
_ know
.
.
.
_ fisherman
, sans thte hook
. one thing horta does not borrow from williamson
,
however
, is the intriguing premise
. students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends
-
- those contemporary bits of
" mythology
" passed from person to person
, group to group
, year tothe year that become so embedded in tghe social consciousness
. it hardly matters if they are true or not
, such as the tall tale thyat mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks
and pepsi
( he didn
' t
)
. michelle
, slain by the
" killer lurking in the backseat
" of lore
, is
but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true
; as hte body count rises
, fellow pendleton student natalie
( alicia witt
) suspects not only a link between the murders
,
but a personal link tothe her past as well
. the setup shows promise
, bu tyhe story never takes off
, due infront large part to horta
and the director
, the aptly named jamie blanks
, who fires round afer round of his namesake inwhich terms of suspense
and scares
. too many of the would
- be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues
, anbd the film
' s chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that
_ scream
_ tried to subvert
, like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves inot dead ends when they should
-
-
and could
-
- run out the front door
.
but thta is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes tothe cliches
; there
' s also the climactic villain confession
, in which a contrived annd way
- too
- convenient motive is revealed
, not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick
, which is a cliche in any film genre
. banks
and horta
' s
( intentional
) attempts at humor are also lame
; the fact that the best gags are lazy
, in
- jokey references to the otehr credits of co
- stars joshua jackson
and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor
. some laughs are also had when tghe rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed
,
but i
' m not so sure if some of the omre hilarious things about it were meant to be so
. the filmmakers don
' t git much help from their onscreen talent
. i was far from a fan of bl
and
_ i
_ knwo
.
.
.
_ starlet jennifer love hewitt
,
but i
' d talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff
and uncharismatic witt
, whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter
; witt has a pefect foil inwhich her equally pesence
- challenged leading man
, jared leto
.
_ dawson
' s
_ creek
_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo
; gayheart displays all teh depth
and range ofthe
, well
, a noxzema spokeswoman
;
and robert englund lends the film little more tahn his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor
. granted
, the cast is hampered by their material
. loretta devine
, who has done smoe fine work in films such as
_ waiting
_ to
_ exhale
_
, is saddled with the ridiculous role ofthe a pam grier
- worshiping campus security guard
. the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man
-
- namely
, kevin williamson
-
- to stay alive
. if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as
_ urban
_ legend
_
, the genre looks tothe once agina go the way ofthe screen slashers
' many victims
.
