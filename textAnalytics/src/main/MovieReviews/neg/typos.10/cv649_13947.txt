, one an inexperienced rookie
( dominic sweeney
)
, the other
( john flaus
) a worn outloud veteran who frequents wendy ' s jazz club
. they ' re tailing mack
, because he has an audiotape thgat may show evidence of govermental corruption
. meanwhile wendy ' s sexually awakener
, fifteen year old sister
( rebecca elmaloglou
) has moved in with her
,
and is secretly watching mack
and wendy ' s late night love trysts
? much zaniness ensues the review
: main problem first
- about 2
% of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work
. unfortunately
, trying to cast hugo race as a voilent
, sexy criminal falls into the
" what the hell where they thinking
" category that takes up 98
% of the rest
.
but
, hell
, it ' s not as if he ' s the only problem in tihs well
- intentioned
but ultimately below average aussie thriller
. leads
, race
and samantha press are wooden
and dull
, hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on
.
though they do manage soem heat later in their love scenes
, helped
, no doubt by them keeping theri mouths shut
. the film suffers every time the story shifts back tothe these two
. which is unfortunately
, thge other main story isn ' t any great shakes either
. the second part
, concerning two cops
, political corruption
and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled
. at many points during teh movie i had no idea what was going on
, a situation tyhat didn ' t improve on repeated viewing
. there is no doubt that this film ' s achilles heel is its script
. as for the rest of the cast
, it ' s a mixed bag
. john flaus
, one of australia ' s most criminally underused actors
, is in top form as tghe withering
, alcoholic jazz fan cop
, who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder
.
although he falters at one point
, when the script calls for him to get up onthe stage
and deliver a drunken beat sermon
,
but believe me
, they way it was written
, no one could have pulled it off
. dominic sweeney is fine
,
though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens
but he really isn ' t given a whole lot tothe do
. pre home
and away elmaloglou is pretty good as thge inquisitive jojo
,
but her character seems extraneous to the stoy
, well
, at least untli the final scenes
. i must admit
, in too deep does have some impressive qualities
, not tje least of which is it visual element
. cinematographers mark gilfedder
& peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city
, whihc is akin to turning london into san paolo
. the bar is an oppressive red
, like all of it ' s patrons are being baked while they drink
, outside it hazy orange by day
and kool blue by night
. if only deborah parson ' s script could have supported this idea better
. having twpo director ' s
( colin south
& john tatoulis
) doesn ' t halp either
, the most glaring exemple of which is the final retribution
/ fight scene
, where for some reason the camera pulls away from thge onscreen acation
,
and moreso importantly it doesn ' t pul away to anything else
. it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance
. it has noone reason to it
; it ' s just bad direction
.
and
, ultimately
, thta is what sums up in too deepo
, it ' s tries to be good
,
and you want it tothe work
,
but
, it ' s just lacking the talent behind it
, that it needs to succeed
.
