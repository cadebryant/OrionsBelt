plot outline
- wendy
( samantha press
)
, a jazz singer
, loves mack
( hugo race
) a criminal annd wanna be rock singer who
' s planning a bank heist
. mack is also being tailed by a cuple of cops
, one an inexperienced rookie
( dominic sweeney
)
, the other
( john flaus
) a worn out veteran who frequents wendy
' s jazz club
. they
' re tailing mack
, because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption
. meanwhile wendy
' s sexually awakener
, fifteen year old sister
( rebecca elmaloglou
) has moved in with her
,
and is secretly watching mack
and wendy
' s late night love trysts
? much zaniness ensues the review
: main problem first
- about 2
% ofthe rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work
. unfortunately
, trying to cast hugo race as a voilent
, sexy criminal falls into the
" what the hell where they thinking
" category that tkaes up 98
% of the rest
.
but
, hell
, it
' s nto as if he
' s the only problem in this well
- intentioned
but ultimately below average aussie thriller
. leads
, race
and samantha press are wooden
and dull
, hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on
.
though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes
, helped
, no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut
. the film suffers every time the story shifts back to theese two
. which is unfortunately
, the other main story isn
' t any great shakes either
. the second part
, concerning two cops
, political corruption
and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled
. at many points during the movie i had no idea whta was going on
, a situation that didn
' t improve onthe repeated viewing
. there is no doubt that this film
' s achilles heel isnt its script
. as for the rest ofthe the cast
, it
' s a mixed bag
. john flaus
, noe of australia
' s most criminally underused actors
, is in top form as the withering
, alcoholic jazz fan cop
, who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder
.
al
though he falters at one point
, when the script calls for him tothe get up on stage anbd deliver a drunken beat sermon
, bu believe me
, they way it was written
, no one could have pulled it off
. dominic sweeney is fine
,
though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens
but he really isn
' t given a whole lot to do
. pre home
and awya elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo
,
but her character seems extraneous to the story
, well
, at least until the final scenes
. i must admit
, in too deep does have some impressive qualities
, not the least of which is it visual element
. cinematographers mark gilfedder
& peter zakharov have acheived the alomst impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city
, which is akin to turning london into san paolo
. the bar is an oppressive red
, like all of it
' s patrons are bieng baked while htey drink
, outside it hazy orange by day
and cool blue by night
. if only deborah parson
' s script could have supported this idea better
. having two director
' s
( colin south
& john tatoulis
) doesn
' t help either
, the most glaring example of which is the final retri
bution
/ fight scene
, where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen acation
,
and more importantly it doesn
' t pull away to anything else
. it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance
. it has no reason to it
; it
' s jstu bad direction
. annd
, ultimately
, that is what sums up in too deep
, it
' s tries to be good
,
and you want it to work
,
but
, it
' s just lacking the talent behind it
, that it needs to sucsede
.
