weighed down by tired plot lines annd spielberg
' s reliance on formulas
,
_ saving private ryan
_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches
. there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics
. spielberg
' s greatest strength as a director is the polished
, formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story
.
but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war
( or the holocaust
) this technique backfires
, for it creates coherent
, comprehensible
and redemptive narratives out of events whose size
, complexity
and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken
. in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of teh stories he films
.
_ saving private ryan
_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a
" pr mission
" to pull a young man
, ryan
( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere
) out of combat on the norm
andy front just after d
- day
. ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the l
andings
and became separated from his fellow soldiers
. the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france
. there
' s no denying spielberg came withing shouting distance of making a great war movie
. the equipmnet
, uniforms
and weapons are superbly done
. the opening sequence
, in which captain miller
( tom hanks
) leads his men onto omaha beach
, is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat
. another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg
' s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences
, such as the shooting ofthe prisoners by allied soldiers
, the banality of death in combat
, the routine foul
- ups in the execution of the war
,
and the cynicism of the troops
. the technical side of the film is peerless
, as always
. the camera work is magnificent
, tyhe pacing perfect
, tghe sets convincing
, the directing without flaw
. hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance
, which was utterly convincing
,
and the supporting cast was excellent
,
though ted danson seems a mite outloud of place as a paratroop colonel
.
yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events
. it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film
, or the story fails to convince
. throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices
( exception
: men are shown burning to death with relative frequency
)
. for example
, we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground
. here
and there men lose limbs
; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety
, there
' s an explosion
,
and miller looks back to see he isnt only pulling half a man
.
but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact
. there are no shoes with only foots in them
, noone limbs scattered everywhere
, no torsos wihtout limbs
, no charred corpses
,
and most importantly
, all corpses hve heads
( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds
)
. the relentless dehumanization of the war
, in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity
, is soft
- pedaled in the film
. ultimately
,
_ saving private ryan
_ bows to both hollywood convention
and tje unwritten rules of wartime photography inspite its portrayal of wounds
and death inaddition war
. rather than saying
_ saving private ryan
_ isnt
" realistic
,
" it woudl be better to describe it as
" having realistic moments
.
" another aspect of the
" hollywoodization
" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue anbd in particular
, the lack of swearing
. anyone familiar with teh literature on the behavior of the men during the war
, such as fussell
' s superb
_ wartime
: underst
anding
and behavior in the second world war
_
( wich has an extensive discussion on swearing
)
, knows tht the troops swore fluently
and without letup
.
" who is this private ryan thta we have to die forthe him
?
" asks one infantrymen in the group of eight
. renedered in wartime demotic
, tyhat should have been expressed as
" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him
?
" or some variant thereof
. conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the
" f
" word
, adn largely baout
( the search for
) food
and sex
. this is all tjhe more inexplicable becuase tghe movei already had an
" r
" rating due to violence
, so swearing could nto possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film
.
however
, the most troubling aspect ofthe the film is the spielbergization of the topic
. the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselfs is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg
. he cannot just cede control to the material
; he has to be bigger than it
. as if affraid to let the viewer find their own
( perhaps unsettled
and not entirely clear
) emotional foothold in teh material
, spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning
and coherence it never had
: the opening
and closing scenes of ryan
and his family in the war cemetary
( reminscent ofthe the closing scene from
_ schindler
' s list
)
, the saccharine exchange between ryan
and his wief at tje close
( every bit as bad as schindler
' s monologue about how his car
, tiepin or ring could have saved another jew
)
, quotes from abraham lincoln
and emerson
, captain miller
' s last words to private ryan
,
and an unbelievable storyline in wich a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain
. that paticular subplot is so hokey
, so predictable
, it nigh on ruins the film
. nowhere infront the film is there a resolute depiction of teh meaninglessness
, stupidity
and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat
( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or colateral dammage
)
. because ofthe its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii
,
_ saving private ryan
_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows
.
