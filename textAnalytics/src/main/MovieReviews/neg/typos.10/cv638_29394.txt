. american pie 2 reunites the cast members from american pie in a different setting
; instead ofthe being high school seniors looking to score befoer they graduate
, they are now past their first year of college
and have gathered in a beach house to enjoy the summer of their lives
. jim
( jason biggs
) is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance
, oz

, having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his studying
- abroad girlfriend
, stifler
( seann william scott
) isnt still a horny stoner
, kevin
( thomas ian nichols
) still has no perosnality
and finch
( eddie kaye thomas
) still longs for stifler
' s mom
. have i missed anyone
? so
, obviously
, not much has changed
. this is not a problem
, provided that the movie boasts the repid
- fire hilarity
and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original
. bu american pie 2 is the very definition of
" sequelitis
.
" it
' s coarser
, yes
,
and it pushes the envelope even more
,
but its heart isn
' t in it
. it
' s easy cash to capitalize off the first film
' s success
,
but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong hte franchise by coming up with something original
. part of the reason why the film doesn
' t work
, i think
, is that while in the original the kids
' quest for sex was a coming
- of
- age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness
. here
, everything hasnt been cheapened
. they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking
; they have no motivation except for sex
, sex
, beer
and sex
. that
' s not to say that yuo can
' t make a decent comedy from tht premise
,
but it is one of american pie 2
' s undoings
. missing
, too
, is the sweetness that permeated american pie
, the htis
- sould
- be
- you qualty of the main players
. here
, the characters are too aware of themselves as pop
- culture icons
,
and they
' re even more one
- note
. stifler annd finch are now caricatures while jim
, oz
and kevin are forced to mkea awkward self
- discoveries at arbitrary moments
, none of them betraying whta the writers think the audiences want to see
.
and
then there
' s the soon
- to
- be
- notorious scene where jim superglues
" himself tothe himself
,
" which perfectly demonstrates yot another of the film
' s ailments
, one that also permeated say it isn
' t so
, director j
. b
. rodgers
' de
but
. there
' s a fine line between comedy
and abject humiliation
,
and american pie 2 is on the wrong side of it
. it
' s hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrased for them
. i shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movie
. if there
' s one redeeming factor to american py 2
, it
' s the inimitable eugene levy as jim
' s dad
, who pops in onthe jim as he
' s about to score
and utters lines liek
" your mother
and i have been known to get frisky
.
.
. not so much anymore
,
but
.
.
.
" annd
then when the girl
' s parents walk in
, blurts out
" this must be your daughter
! i didn
' t get her name
,
but hopefully my son did
.
" if only the rest of the movie had the wit
and wisdom of levy
' s performance
. thsi isnt an unworthy sequel to a gross
- fest that brought back yhe raunchy teen comedy
. the box
- office ofthe this onw shouldnt keep teh genre going strong
, which is disapointing
. the genre needs a hiatus
; filmmakers are getting lazy
.
