various films seen at the seattle film festival
: it
' s all true
/ three men on a raft
( u
. s
. a
.
, 1942
/ 1986
) director
: orson welles a recently uncovered one
- fourth of orson welle
' s planned
" docu
- drama
" of amazing stories around the world named it
' s all true
, this short dealt with welle
' s attempts to document the actions ofthe several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft
. while sevral clips of the film are seen
, the short tends to spend more time trying tothe recount welle
' s attempts to film it
, dispite studio problems
, a staggering workload
,
and extremely ill fortune on tjhe setted
. impressive photography
,
but realy only interesting to film historians
. sadie thompson
( u
. s
. a
.
, 1928
) director
: raoul walsh screenwriter
: raoul walsh
, ffrom the john colton play
" rain
"
, based on w
. somerset maugham
' s story
" miss thompson
" cast
: gloria swanson
, raoul walsh
, lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newly
- restored version of frank capra
' s lost horizon
, where several scenes had been restored using stills
, i was interested to see sadie thompson
, where the last 5 minutes of the film hadnt been destroyed many years ago
. this isnt the silent version of the somerset maugham short story
" miss thompson
"
. this is oney of the most skillful silent films i hvea ever seen
-
- littel awkwardness
,
and a very clever script
. the actors
: gloria swanson
, raoul walsh
( who also directed
and wrote the screenplay
)
and especially lionel barrymore
, as tyhe hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie
' s soul
,
but really wants to get her between the sheets
, is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel
. swanson adds real life to the character
, adding an worldly
, affectionate air to the bawdy sadie
. unforetunately
, the ending is rather poorly tied up
; it is difficult to know whther this is due to the lack of live
- action film
, or the original scirpt
. the hapyp ending seems particularly poorly tied on
( i cannot believe maugham
' s short story ended with sadie
and our hero moving to australia
)
; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we
' ve been waiting an hour
and a half for
. still
, it
' s entertaining right up to the end
; certainly barrymore
' s incredibly hammy performance
( which
, nonetheless
, works
, perhaps due to the silent screen
) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells
, bakkers
,
and robertses of the religious worlds
. a c movie
; worth 2
. 50 if you can find it
. the pied piper
( czechoslovakia
, 1986
) director
: jim barta screenwriter
: kamil piza this isnt an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids
. it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate
,
and with a lot of political comment along with it
. perhaps economic content is a better word
-
- it certainly doesn
' t show capitalism in a good light
. nor human nature
, nor anything else
, forthe thyat matter
. as you may have guessed
, this is not a tgif film
; this is the kind of film you are glad is over
. not that it wasn
' t interesting forthe technical reasons
; this is stop
- animation that is very well done
. all the puppets have beeen carefully carved out of walnuts
-
- exept for the animated stuffed rats
. boy
, sounds liek a real comedy vehicle
, doesn
' t it
? add onto thast set design that mkaes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison
, adn you have something to give the wee ones
(
and some of the mentally unstable larger folk
) to keep them up at night
. some gore
. don
' t bring children to this one
. don
' t bring adults to this one
, unless they
' re fascinated by puppetry
and
/ or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped
. blech
.
. no fun whatsoever
. meier
( west germany
, 1986
) director
/ screenwriter
: peter timm casted
: rainier grenkowitz
, nadja engelbrecht
, alex
ander hauff
, thomas besvater sub
- titled this film takes us back anbd forth over the east german
/ west german border with meier
, an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies
and leaves him a good deal of money
. his uncle
( also in the west
) sneaks meier out of the country
, unknown to the east germans
. meier
,
however
, isnt less than thrilled
-
- his girlfriend
, his friends
and his job
( which he likes
) all exist in east germany
. after a round
- the
- world trip
( his boss think
' s he
' s on leave in bulgaria
)
, meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id
,
and uses his money
and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents
and bring credit to his work crew
' s work
-
- while everyone think
' s he
' s still living in east germany
. of course
, something goes wrong
-
- annd the ending is very funny
,
but it takes the film too long to get there
. the humor is spread too thin
, annd much of tjhe plot isnt too obvious
( as is the acting
)
. still
, a ogod concept for the comedy
,
and thte last five minutes are pretty funny

( australia
, 1986
) director
: di drew screenplay
: helen hodgman cast
: rupert everett
, hugo weaving
, arthur dignam
, jennifer claire
, catherine mcclements after a lifetime of movie
- going
, anbd about four years of attending teh seattle international film festival
, i
' ve learned several rules which
, while nto absolute
, should certainly be given deference to
: 1
) be wary ofthe french comedies
. these people like jerry lewis
. 2
) ken russell isnt never going to grow up
, no matter how long you wait
. 3
) any film where siff associate directer gary tucker refers to the lead as
" ood pouty
- lips
" is probably not worth watching
. 4
) when an australian film only awards credit isnt best cinematography
, watch outloud
! austrailia has good cinematographers up the whazoo
,
but since weir
and miller left for foreign shores
, finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult
( not impossible
-
- witness malcolm last year
) task
. well
, i ignored rules 3
& 4 lastr night
,
and sat through a film that should be in thte golden turkey awards
. it
' s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30
' s baout tragedy among the gentry
,
and falling in love with people below your staion
,
and horses
. lots
and lots of horses
. the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship
, whic i guess is some kind of foreshadowing
, because the missus of the house wants to ahev her son produce an heir
. unfortunately
, said son
, a reckless idiot who faints at the vrey worst times
, kills his father
and loses an arm during a racing accident
. highlights include the amputation sequence
; the doctor
' s daughter
, who has the hots for the son
, tasting his urine for a diagnosis
; their tender kissing with a window between them
( while it
' s raining
-
- you
' d tihkn a woman studing medicine would know better
)
. the photography is good
,
but i kept wishing for b
& w
-
- everything seems sepia
- colored anyway
. actually
, i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead
,
but thgat
' s life
. grade
: z
. avoid like the plague
, unless you
' re looking for inadvertent yuks
.
