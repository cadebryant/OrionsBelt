various films seen at the seattle film festival
: it ' s all true
/ three men on a raft
( u
. s
. a
.
, 1942
/ 1986
) director
: orson welles a recently uncovered one
- fourth of orson welle ' s planned
" docu
- drama
" of amazing stories around the world named it ' s all true
, this short dealt with welle ' s attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who hadnt become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft
. while severeal clips of the film are seen
, the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle ' s attempts to film it
, dispite studio problems
, a staggering workload
,
and extremely ill fortune on the set
. impressive photography
,
but relaly only interesting to film historians
. sadie thompson
( u
. s
. a
.
, 1928
) director
: raoul walsh screenwriter
: raoul walsh
, from the john colton play
" rain
"
, based on w
. somerset maugham ' s story
" miss thompson
" cast
: gloria swanson
, raoul walsh
, lionel barrymore silent after the discussion of the newely
- restored version of frank capra ' s lost horizon
, where several scenes had been restored using stills
, i was interested to see sadie thompson
, where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago
. this isnt the silent version of tghe somerset maugham short story
" miss thompson
"
. this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen
-
- little awkwardness
,
and a very clever script
. hte actors
: gloria swanson
, raoul walsh
( who also directed
and wrote the screenplay
)
and especially lionel barrymore
, as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to sive sadie ' s soul
,
but really wants to get her between hte sheets
, is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel
. swanson adds real life to the character
, adding an worldly
, affectionate air to the bawdy sadie
. unfortunately
, the ending is rather poorly tied up
; it is difficult to know whther this is due to thte lack of live
- acation film
, or the original script
. the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on
( i cannot believe maugham ' s short story ended with sadie
and our hero moving to australia
)
; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we ' ve been waiting an hour
and a half for
. still
, it ' s entertaining right up to the end
; certainly barrymore ' s incredibly hammy performance
( which
, nonetheless
, works
, perhaps due tothe the silent screen
) is a must for anyone who isnt fed up with the actions of the falwells
, bakkers
,
and robertses of the religeous worlds
. a c movie
; worth 2
. 50 if yuo can find it
. the pied piper
( czechoslovakia
, 1986
) director
: jim barta screenwriter
: kamil piza this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids
. it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate
,
and with a lot of political comment along with it
. perhaps economic content is a better word
-
- it certainly doesn ' t show capitalism in a good light
. nor human nature
, nor anything else
, for that matter
. as you may have guessed
, this is not a tgif film
; this is the kind of film you are glad is over
. not that it wasn ' t interesting for technical reasons
; htis is stop
- animation that is very well done
. all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts
-
- except for the animated stuffed rats
. boy
, sounds like a real comedy vehicle
, doesn ' t it
? add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison
,
and you have something to give hte wee ones
(
and soem of hte mentally unstable larger folk
) tothe keep them up at night
. some gore
. don ' t bring children to this one
. don ' t bring adults to this one
, unless they ' re fascinated by puppetry
and
/ or hite capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped
. blech
.
. no fun whatsoever
. meier
( west germany
, 1986
) director
/ screenwriter
: peter timm cast
: rainier grenkowitz
, nadja engelbrecht
, alexander hauff
, thomas besvater sub
- titled this film takes us back
and forth over teh east german
/ west german border with meier
, an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies
and leaves him a good deal of money
. his uncle
( also in the west
) sneaks meier out of the country
, unknown tothe the east germans
. meier
,
however
, is less than thrilled
-
- his girlfriend
, his friends
and his job
( which he likes
) all exist in east germany
. aftter a round
- the
- world trip
( his boss htikn ' s he ' s on leave in bulgaria
)
, meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id
,
and uses his money
and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents
and bring credit to his work crew ' s work
-
- hwile everyone think ' s he ' s still living in east germany
. of course
, something goes wrong
-
-
and the ending is very funny
,
but it takes the film too long to get there
. thge humor is spread too thin
,
and much of the plot is too obvious
( as is the acting
)
. still
, a good consept for the comedy
,
and the last five minutes are pretty funny
. c

. the right hand man
( australia
, 1986
) directer
: di drew screenplay
: helen hodgman casted
: rupert everett
, hugo weaving
, arthur dignam
, jennifer claire
, catherine mcclements after a lifetime of movie
- going
,
and about four years of attending the seattle intenational film festival
, i ' ve learned several rules which
, while not absolute
, should certainly be given deference to
: 1
) be wary of french comedies
. these people like jerry lewis
. 2
) ken russell is never oging to grow up
, no matter how long yuo wait
. 3
) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as
" old pouty
- lips
" is probably not worth watching
. 4
) when an australian film only awards credit isnt best cinematography
, watch out
! australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo
,
but since weir
and miller left for foreign shores
, finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult
( not impossible
-
- witness malcolm last yera
) task
. well
, i ignored rules 3
& 4 last night
,
and sat through a film that shoudln be in the golden trukey awards
. it ' s as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in thge 30 ' s about tragedy among the gentry
,
and falling inwhich love whith people below your station
,
adn horses
. lots
and lots ofthe horses
. the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship
, which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing
, because the missus of the house wants tothe have her son produce an heir
. unfortunately
, said son
, a reckless idiot who faints at the veyr worst times
, kills his father
annd loses an arm durig a racing accident
. highlights include the amputation sequence
; the doctor ' s daughter
, who has the hots for the son
, tasting his urine for a diagnosis
; their tender kissing with a window between them
( while it ' s raining
-
- you ' d think a woman studying medicine would know better
)
. the photography is good
,
but i kept wishing for b
& w
-
- everything seems sepia
- colored anyway
. actually
, i wished i was watching swiming to cambodia instead
,
but that ' s life
. grade
: z
. avoid like the plague
, unless you ' re looking for inadvertent yuks
.
