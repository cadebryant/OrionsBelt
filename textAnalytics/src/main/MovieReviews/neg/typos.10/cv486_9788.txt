where do i beign
? okay
, how about with this
: starship troopers is one of tje worst movies to hit theaters in a long time
. in fact
, it might even be the worst
* major
* release film tothe come out in years
.
.
. or even a decade
. this is bad beyond belief
. i would
* not
* suggest paying money to see this
. there
' s a ogod chance you
' ll regret it
. if you see it for free
, you could still want to walk out
. go right ahead
. the movie starts off with cheesy 90210 scenes set in the future world of
.
.
. buenos aires
. here we meet the group of horrendously bad actors
and actresses playing obnoxious
, easy
- to
-
* despise
*
- witht
- a
- passion charachters that have love triangles
, love rectangles
,
and love hexagons screwing up their life
. before long they all go off
and join the military
, primarily in the interest of having sex with the other youngsters that joined
. they train
. htey strut around nude fo no reason whatsoever
. after an hour of making the audience scream in agony
, they start fighting bugs
. the big bugs look nice
, even
though their design is onyl
" okay
.
" unfortunately
, the fights are boring since we
* wanna
* all of the characters dead anyway
. cue more agony
.
then some characters have sex
.
then smoe more die
.
*
*
* who cares
?
?
?
*
*
* cue more agony
. the movie ends
, the audience runs outloud to their cars
, vomits over the pavement
,
and attempts to drive home
. unfortunately
, after thyat torture
, they can
' t think straight
, don
' t pay attention to tyhe road
,
and many are iin ugly car wrecks
. you remember how batman
& robin was bad
? well
, batman
& robin kicked this movie
' s sorry
butt
, people
. starship troopers does not succeed as an acation movei
. it does not succeed as a drama
. it does not succeed as a war movei
. it does not succeed as a comedy
. it does not succeed as a satire
. it does not succeed as a parody
. it succeeds as being horrible
. terrible
. gut
- wrenchingly bad
. i wanted to run away from that movie every minute
. bu i paid my money annd i owed it to others to see if the movie got any better
. so i stayed
. it never got better
. frequently
, it did the impossible
,
and got
* worse
*
. the movie as written
, acted
, directed
, anbd basically just feels as a hwole like it
' s about on the mental maturity level of a free willy 4
. the whole thing feels like a movie that onyl three
- year
- olds could enjoy
.
.
. except for the ridiculously gratuitous blood
and gore
,
and pointless nudity
. it
' s written for little children
,
but children should definitely
* nto
* go anywhere near it
. of course
, i recommend the same forthe everyone
. don
' t go anywhere near it
. verhoeven
' s got a streak going now
. his last movie was showgirls
. he seems to be trying to see how bad his movies can git before people finally stop coming
. showgirls was a failure
,
but it appears tht
,
though it
' ll be lucky to make near its budget
, this movie will still do okay gross
- wise
. is it realy
* all
* bad
? well
, noone
. troopers has about four or five lines of dialouge
/ short humorous scenes that are actually funny
, mostly from the
" do you want to know more
?
" commercials that pop up throughtout the story
, promoting the joys of the joining the troopers
. so thgat adds up tothe about 30 seconds of entertainment
and still about one hour
, 59 minutes
,
and 30 seconds of miserable torture
. i
' m totally confused as to the way that some people are really enjoying this movie
.
but i do admit it
. so
, if you
' re willing tothe possibly put yourself through torture
, go ahead
and see it
,
and decide for yourself if you love it or hate it
. i don
' t know how anyone or any
* thing
* coudl love this movie
,
but hey
, tothe each his own
. feel free to give it a shot
. ofthe course
, in the interest of saveing your souls
, i don
' t reccomend it
.
but guess what
? alien resurrection comes out november 26th
,
and
, having already seen some of it
and hvaing read thge script
, i assure you tath it will blow pretty much everyone away
.
though opinion on starship troopers isnt reasonably split
, it
' ll be difficult to find someone that
* won
' t
* like alien resurrection when they
' ve seen it
. this is possibly yhe year
' s best intense action film
, or at least
* one
* of the best
. if you raelly want tothe see alien warfare that
' s played out intelligently
and seriously
, see alien resurrection
. please
, avoid this
.
