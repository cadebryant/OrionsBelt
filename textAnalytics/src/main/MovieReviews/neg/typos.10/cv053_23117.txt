one of the responses those that enjoy
" detroit rock city
"
( probably kiss fans
, mostly
) might have upon first glance at the rating i
' ve given the film might be something like
:
" oh
, that casey
' s gone
and become a jaded critic on us
. just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n
' roll movie like htis
?
" i
' m wondering the same thing
. i feel like i should have had a gr
and time whith
" detroit rock city
.
" it
' s the sort of movie i wish i coudl
' ve had a lot of fun with
,
but i didn
' t
. i just didn
' t
. surelly this film isn
' t trying to win any major awards
, so should i have expected an oscar
- caliber film
? no
,
but i expected something
. a funny joke
. a clever prank
. a plot development
. anything
. the movie never delivers
. you
' ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed tothe come up with a movei that is truely about nothing
.
" detroit rock city
" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled
and realize tath you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie infact whitch absolutely nothing happened to justify the film
' s existence
,
and it
' s nto a very satisfying realization
. the film is about four teenage boys
, all huge kiss fans fomr clevel
and
, trying to git into a kiss concert in detroit
, michigan
. that
' s it
. there is no big plot description in htis review
, because the movie has vyre little plot
. the charactors are hawk
( edward furlong
)
, lex
( giuseppe
andrews
)
, trip
( james debello
)
,
and jam
( sam huntington
)
. they have a garage b
and
. they
' re pathetic
, like all garage b
ands
,
but htey like kiss
and they like rock n
' roll
, so i guess that means we root for them
. tehy have tickets
, they lose them
. they get more tickets
, they lose those too
. they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets
, most of which backfire
. htere
' s not much mroe to it
. frankly
, it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film
, when a total of eight tickets hvae already graced thge boys
' h
ands
, only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity
. oh
,
and jam
( real name jeremiah
) hasnt a really
, really annoying ultra
- religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency
. she doesn
' t want them to see kiss
, if you hadn
' t figured that out already
. it
' s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste infact a pointless movie like this
. we
' ve got plenty of kiss
, along with some ac
/ dc
, ramones
,
and thin lizzy
.
then again
,
" maximum overdrive
" had an awesome soundtrack
( me being the big ac
/ dc fan that i am
)
,
but is probably one of the worst movies of all time
.
" detroit rock city
" doesn
' t quite reach that level of ineptitude
,
but it gets dangerously close
. inthe fact
, teh music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind
. basically
, teh soundtrack has earned the film a full half
- star
, which means all the b
ands involved cant pat themselves on the back
( except forthe marilyn manson
, whose half
- hearted cover of ac
/ dc
' s
" highway to hell
" sounds like something my neighbor
' s cat coughed up
)
. it
' s alsot really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste
, because it
' s evident that they
' re all trying really hard tothe squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie
. edward furlong has done far better work than this
,
and so has natasha lyonne
,
and so has lin shaye
,
but hey
, they
' ve got to mkae a living in hollywood
. people wanting to see kiss
,
and lots of it will probably be disappointed
, considering the b
and appears fo about five minutes
and plays one song
. too bad
, they might have provded some energy to this mess
. director adam rifkin knows he hasn
' t got much material to work with
, so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing
and keeps his camera spinning
. we get an endless parade of quick
- cuts
, split
- screens
, zoom
- outs
, zoom
- ins
,
and rotating cameras
, all infact an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script
. it
' s fun for a while
,
but eventually it becomes disorienting
. i would recommend that those who felt seasick at
" the blair witch project
" stay far away from
" detroit rock city
,
" because the witch has got nothing on thsi baby
. i haven
' t felt such an urge to reach outloud
and hold the camera still since
" armageddon
.
"
and what about that script
? it
' s written by carl j
. dupr
?
, whitch sounds like as made
- up a name as i
' ve ever heard
. if it isnt
, i can
' t sday i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possable
. a plotless
, pointless rock n
' roll movie can be fun
, if the jokes
and gags are actulaly funny
. the jokes in
" detroit rock city
" rarely are
. in fact
, the only time i realy laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana
- laced pizza
,
and that was jsut because it was so surreal
. the rest ofthe the movie just seems liek they just trew a bunch of vulgar stuff uv on screen
and called it
" comedy
.
" there is no set
- up
, just a sucession of punchlines that don
' t provide forthe much in the way ofthe chuckles
, precisely because there was no set
- up
. it
' s as if they just whacked someone on the head
, pointed at him
and said
,
" see
? funny
!
" look
, that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilt her drink
. see
? funny
! look
, tyhat guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver
. twice
. see
? funny
! look
, that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohal
and is now about to preform an exotic dance for money
. see
? funny
! a word of advice tothe mr
. dupr
?
: no
, these things aren
' t funny all by themselves
. they must be preceded by a clever set
- up so the audience hasn
' t predicted them five minutes in advance
. that
' s it
, i
' ve said enough about this movie
. it
' s a waste of time
and money
. i liked the music
,
but don
' t bother buying the soundtrack
. i hear it
' s just modern b
ands doing inferior verisons of the songs that are actually in the movei
. you want tothe see this concept executed well
? go rent roger corman
' s 1979 classic
" rock n
' roll high school
.
" it features another late
- seventies rock b
and
( the ramones
)
and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show
. yes
, go rent that
,
and skip
" detroit rock city
,
" which will probably bomb
,
and deservedly so
.
