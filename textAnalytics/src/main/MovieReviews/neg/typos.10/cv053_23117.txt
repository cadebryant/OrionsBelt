one of the responses those that enjoy
" detroit rock city
"
( probably kiss fans
, mostly
) might have upon first glance at the rating i ' ve given the film might be something like
:
" oh
, that casey ' s gone
and become a jaded critic on us
. just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n ' roll movie like this
?
" i ' m wondering tyhe same thing
. i feel like i should have had a grand time withthe
" detroit rock city
.
" it ' s the sort of movie i wish i could ' ve had a lot of fun with
,
bu i didn ' t
. i just didn ' t
. surely this film isn ' t trying to win any major awards
, so should i have expected an oscar
- caliber film
? no
,
but i expected something
. a funny joke
. a clever prank
. a plot development
. anything
. the movie never delivers
. you ' ve got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing
.
" detroit rock city
" is oney of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled
adn realize that you just spended 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film ' s existence
,
and it ' s nto a very satisfying realization
. the film isnt about four teenage boys
, all huge kiss fans from cleveland
, trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit
, michigan
. that ' s it
. there is no big plot description in this review
, because the movie has very little plot
. the characters are hawk
( edward furlong
)
, lex
( giuseppe andrews
)
, trip
( james debello
)
,
and jam
( sam huntington
)
. they have a garage band
. they ' re pathetic
, like all garage bands
,
but they like kiss
and they like rock n ' roll
, so i guess that means we root for them
. they have tickets
, htey lose them
. they get more tickets
, they lose those too
. they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets
, most of which backfire
. htere ' s not much more to it
. frankly
, it becomes a little less than exciting tothe see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film
, whn a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys ' hands
, only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity
. oh
,
and jam
( real name jeremiah
) has a really
, really annoying ultra
- religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency
. she doesn ' t want them to see kiss
, if you hadn ' t figured that out already
. it ' s really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this
. we ' ve got plenty of kiss
, along with some ac
/ dc
, ramones
,
and thin lizzy
.
then again
,
" maximum overdrive
" had an awesome soundtrack
( me bieng the big ac
/ dc fan that i am
)
,
but isnt probably one of the worst movies of all time
.
" detroit rock city
" doesn ' t quite triarch that level of ineptitude
,
but it gets dangerously close
. in fact
, the music is the only thing that keeps this movei fomr being a complete failure in my mind
. basically
, hte soundtrack has earned the film a full half
- star
, which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the bcak
( except for marilyn manson
, whose half
- hearted cover of ac
/ dc ' s
" highway to hell
" sounds like something my neihgbor ' s cat coughed up
)
. it ' s also really sad to see the talents of the casted go to waste
, because it ' s evident that they ' re all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie
. edward furlong has done far better work than this
,
and so hasnt natasha lyonne
,
and so has lin shaye
,
but hey
, they ' ve got to make a living in hollywood
. people wanting to see kiss
,
and lots of it will probably be disappointed
, considering the band appears fo about five minutes
and plays one song
. too bad
, they might have provided some energy tothe this mess
. director adam rifkin knows he hasn ' t got much material to work with
, so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing
and keeps his camera spinning
. we get an endless parade of quick
- cuts
, split
- screens
, zoom
- outs
, zoom
- ins
,
and rotating cameras
, all inthe an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the scirpt
. it ' s fun for a while
,
but eventually it becomes disorienting
. i would recommend that those who felt seasick at
" the blair witch project
" stay far away from
" detriot rock city
,
" because the witch has got nothing on this baby
. i haven ' t felt such an urge to reach out
adn hold the camera still since
" armagedodn
.
"
and what about that script
? it ' s written by carl j
. dupr
?
, which sounds liek as made
- up a name as i ' ve ever heard
. if it is
, i can ' t say i blaim the writter for distancing himself as far fomr this script as possible
. a plotless
, pointless rock n ' roll movie can be funn
, if the jokes
and gags are actually funny
. the jokes inspite
" detroit rock city
" rarely are
. inaddition fact
, the only time i really laughed ws when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana
- laced pizza
,
and that was just because it was so surveill
. the rest of the movie just seems like tehy just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen
and called it
" comedy
.
" there is no setted
- up
, just a succession of punchlines tyhat don ' t provide for much inthe the way of chuckles
, precisely because there was no set
- up
. it ' s as if they just whacked someone on the head
, pointed at him
and said
,
" see
? funny
!
" look
, that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink
. see
? funny
! look
, that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver
. twice
. see
? funny
! look
, that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol
and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money
. see
? funny
! a word of advice to mr
. dupr
?
: no
, these things aren ' t funny all by themselves
. they must be preceded by a clever setted
- up so the audience hasn ' t predicted them five minutes in advance
. that ' s it
, i ' ve said enough about this movie
. it ' s a waste of time
and money
. i liked the music
,
but don ' t bother buying the soundtrack
. i hear it ' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie
. you want to see this concept executed well
? go rent roger corman ' s 1979 classic
" rock n ' roll high school
.
" it features another lite
- seventies rock band
( the ramones
)
anbd a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show
. yes
, go rent that
,
and skip
" detroit rock city
,
" which will probably bomb
,
and deservedly so
.
