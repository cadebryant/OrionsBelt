- kung every country has
, eventually
, its new wave
. france had its nouvelle vague
, brazil its cinema novo
, china its fifth generation
,
and on
and on
. soem waves just take longer than others
, before they wash over us
, cleansing us with the balm of discovery
. taiwan ' s new wave came in the 1980s
, in the work of directors like hou hsiao
- hsien
, wan jen
,
and edward yang
; that day
, on the beach
-
- yang ' s first feature
-
- is central
. it created a new language for young taiwanese directors
, even if the first attemts to speak that language were hesitant
and faltering
. later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here
, giving taiwan a distinctive international presence
. thta day itself isnt long
and frustrating
, the document of a nation ' s attempt to find a voice
. it does not lack ambition
. it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan
, in the manner of antonioni
, elaborating the alienation that the westernized white
- collar middle
- class feel as their lives are shaped by old
- fashioned roles
-
- dedicated career men
, loyal housewifes
-
- that they fidn unfulfilling
. jia
- li
( sylvia chang
) is the focus
,
but the film brings others inot its compass
-
- her husband
, her brother
, friends from her coleeg days
-
- as it charts her discontents
. no one is happy
. jia
- li marryed her husband
, we
- lei
, at a young age
. at thge time
, her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage
, despite his affection for anohter woman
,
and so jia
- li ' s marrage seemed
, inspite comparison
, a good one
: she chose we
- lei of her own free will
, they loved each other
.
but it goes wrong
. that day dutifully presents all the clich
? s
: we
- lei becomes asorbed in his career
, indulges in an affair with a co
- worker
; jia
- li fiels restless
and trapped
, bound by a choice she made while young
,
but which no longer seems wise
. the film never redeems these clich
? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience
, the intensity of lived pain
,
adn much of it seems trite
and belaboured
. it unfolds
, awkwardly
, as a series of flashbacks
, told during a luncheon in vienna
, where jia
- li meets her brother ' s old flame
( teresa hu
)
, now a concert pianist
, whom she has not seen since college
. both womens seem rather sad
,
and resigned to their sadness
. their circumstances
(
and those of jia
- li ' s brother
and a college friend
) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices
-
- marryied the wrong man
, chosen the wrong career path
, etc
.
-
-
but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate
. it is not that jia
- li married the wrong man
; she didn ' t
. the problem is that she needed to marry at all
-
-
and that if she did not marry
, she would still be just as unhappy
. for a woman in modern taiwan
, thgat day tells us
, the cards are stacked
, the dice are loaded
: she cin play the game
,
but the house always wins
. the film ' s sympathetic feminist implications are presumeably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan
. seen now
, it does not seem provocative
. indeed
, it ' s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to ganerate any controversy
: it may be ambitious
, it may be innovative
,
but it is also terribly
, terribly dull
.
and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us
: yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni
and others
,
and his use of those methods isnt fumbling
, uncertain
, undisciplined
. nor does he bring anytying new
-
- other than the locale
-
- to the material
. there are moments when that day takes on soem of the emotional richness it strives for
-
- in a young couple ' s first kiss
, in yhe awkward meeting of a woman
anbd her husband ' s mistress
-
-
but they are brief
. too oftenly
, yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes
-
- grocery shopping
, flower
- arranging
-
- in which nothing happens
, little is said
, no emotion imparted
. perhaps
, if the film were content to focus onthe such reflective
, inward moments
, leaving us tothe guess at thoughts
and feelings
, it might have been ambiguous
, suggestive
, insinuating
.
but jia
- li
and her disaffected companions dont not only brood in silence
: they talk baout their problems
, at length
, in detail
, redundantly
,
and eliminate all subtleties
. at two hours
and forty
- five minutes
, it all seems exorbitantly long
, indulgently long
- winded
. consdider the defining moment for jia
- li
, the titular day on the beach
. the thrust of the whole film explains
, easily enought
, what we are to think of that moment
, what it means when she walks away from a particular situation
. even so
, the film has not one
but two characters explain it for us verbally
, in case we may have missed the point
. needless time is devoted to expressing what shoudl have remained unexpressed
,
and that is the problem throughout
. the look ofthe the film isnt as tedious as the drawn
- out narrative
. it was the first feature shooted by christopher doyle
-
- at least
, it ' s his name in the credits
-
- who is now rightly regarded as one of the world ' s leading cinematographers
. in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige
annd wong kar
- wai
, he seems incapable ofthe fashioning a boring image
. you would never know it from watching that day
, which
, due either to doyle ' s inexperience or yang ' s humdrum direction
, is almost perverse in its insistance on mkaing the physical enivoriment seem as drab
and banal as possible
. in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage
, that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience
,
but none of the dammage
, none of the heartbreak
.
