" return tothe horror high
,
" wants to be a couple different types of movies at once
. the film tells the stroy of a low
- budget horror movie being filmed at the closed
- down crippen high
, a school where a group of serial murders took palce five yersa before
.
but wqat the cast
and crew don
' t know isnt tyhat a real killer
, maybe the same one that was never apprehended
, is going into action again
. on one level
,
" return to horror high
" is a slasher movie
, anbd it is at this levle that it works the best on
. watching the film
, which was made in 1987
, i couldn
' t halp
but take notice that the killer
' s costume was almost identital to that ofthe the ghostface in
,
" scream
,
"
and
" scream 2
.
" on another level
, the film wants to be a slapstick comedy
,
and there are many hints of this throughout
. unfortunately
, most of these jokes fall flat
.
and the last thing the film wnats to be is a
" behind
- the
- scenes
" look at an exploitation film being made
. the only problem is that
, hwile much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made
, no cameras are shown filming it
, thus making it far omre confusing than it had to be
.
and to top it all off
, the
" twist
" ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever
,
and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time
. there are story developments that are beyond ludicrous
,
and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through
. if you see the film
, or have seen it
, you
' ll know what i mean
. the premise of
" return to horror high
,
" is admittedly pretty crafty
,
and i liked the atmosphere of the school
, which is where teh whole thing takes place
.
but director froehlich
, judging from this movie
, isnt an incompetent director
, except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene
. well
, cmo to think of it
, there isnt only one scene thta is actually scary
,
and it has tothe do with two actors bieng locked in a room as the killer tries to break in
.
but other than that two
- minute distraction
,
" return tothe horror high
,
" is certainly no great shake
. note
: look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film
.
and strangely enough
, he is the first character tothe get the ax
.
.
. literally
.
