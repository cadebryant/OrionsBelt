a sensuous romantic comedy
, about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom
. there isnt no special ingredient on the menu for what isnt dished out
, its the kind ofthe stuf i
' ve seen befoer
and was made nauseous by its silly idae of love
and what it thinks is funny
. the film plans to exploit the beauty
and sweetness of its delicious star pen
? lope cruz
, who plays a brazilian chef iwth a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations
, the aromas jstu sensually waft from her cooking pot
,
but who can
' t git by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story
. pen
? lope was wonderful in pedro almod
? var
' s
" all baout my mother
,
"
but here she is so visible in such a stale story
, where she can only smile
and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking
, that she somehow looks ridiculous
, as if she got egg all over her face
. tghe best you can say about her
, is that she
' s nto to blame fo this picture being so off
. this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex
, is in my opinion
, worst than a raunchy film thta delivers what it syas it will
. tjhe stroy is all baout the love
, motion sickness
,
and cooking ability of isabella
( cruz
)
, who is born in bahia
, brazil
and learns to cook at an early age from her parents
' cook
. tothe cure her motion sickness
, her parents tryed every remedy
, until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of tje sea for her cure
. she is able to control it now as long as she doesn
' t drive a car
, ride elevators
, follow in dancing
,
and is the woman on top when making love
. in other words
, she has to be in control of things
. in her small fishing town she falls in love with a h
andsome macho latin waiter
, toninho oliveira
( murilo ben
? cio
)
and marries him
. they opne up a successful restaurant
, where she slaves away in the kitchen
but he gets all the credit fo it
, even
though he
' s a loafer
. noe night she catches him in bed with another girl
and decides to leave fo san francisco
. we don
' t see her in flight
, so i can
' t tell how she h
andeled her motion sickness problem
-
- unless she flew the plane
. she visits her friend
' s apartment monica
( harold perrineau jr
.
)
, who is a cross
- dresser
, blending right into the san francisco scene
. to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho
, she calls her spiritualist friend
and gets her to cast an irreversible spell
, freeing her from ever loving him again
. her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff
( mark feurerstein
) gets a whiff of her cooking anbd storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell anbd presents her with her own live tv cooking show
. yuo can really write the script fomr here on by yourself
.
.
. as the despondent toninho begins tothe realize what a good thing he had
,
but things continue to go bad for him
: there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village
, ther is no chef to replace his wief
, as the restaurant is about to close fo good
. so he comes to san francisco
, figuring he can charm her again
. he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians
, the ones he used when courting her
, when he serenaded her under her window
. he sees his wife on tv withthe monica as her sidekick
, the yuppie tv producer chasing after her
,
and sees that she is noone longer charmed by him
. when he sneaks on her tv show set
and tries to woo her with his musical group
and him singing corny love songs to her
, the ratings go up
and he
' s hired as a regular on the show
. the show gets so big
, that tghe network honchos come onboard
, taking it national
.
but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show
, get rid of monica beccause he
' s a freak
, hve isabella cook with tabasco instade of the brazilian peppers she uses
, adn they change her ethnic dresses tothe low
- cut vanna white type of sexy dresses
. cliff
, her would
- be boyfriend
, acts creepy
and sides with the network big
- shots
, even
though he loved everything she did
. these tv scenes were nto only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos
, they were revolting
. it was an insult to one
' s intelligence
. i
' m sure that i
' m not spoiling the ending for anyone
, when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways
and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again
. if the film wasn
' t terrable enough
, monica
and cliff act onthe their attraction for each other
and become lovers
. it was so awkwardly done
, that it had no sense of truth or humor to it
. this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film
, because it doesn
' t look or feel like an almod
? var film
, hte type of film it aspired to be
,
but more like a film that was interferred wih from above
. its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming
and more dull than chic
, as it seaches for box office heaven
.
