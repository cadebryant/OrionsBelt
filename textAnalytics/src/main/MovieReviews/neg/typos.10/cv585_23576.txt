the ads make
" hanging up
" seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father
and his three daughters
. anyone who whent to the movie expecting that left disappointed
. all of the movie
' s funny scenes were included in the ad
. so what dont we get
? eve markes
( meg ryan
) just put her father lou mozell
( walter matthau
) into a hospital
. once upon a time
, lou wass a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now
- estranged wief
. his one great moent in life ws writing a film for john wayne
, who gave him a giant bullet
- shaped trophy
. nowe lou is senile
and deterioriating rapidly
. eve tries tothe convince her sisters georgia
( diane keaton
)
and maddy
( lisa kudrow
) that their father is dying annd needs them
. both are slow to show concern
. so devoted eve st
ands vigil over her father
, who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia
, while running her own buisness
( planning special events
) anbd caring forthe her son
( jesse james
)
.
( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st
. bernard for eve to care for
.
) the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve
' s events where georgia is the keynote speaker
. there
' s a superficial resemblance tothe shakespeare
' s
" king lear
"
( senile king with three daughters
: one devoted saint
and two selfish bitches
)
,
but the material is apparently drawn from life
. sister screenwriters delia
and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writting team
. henry
and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays
, including
" desk set
"
and
" there
' s no business liuke show business
.
"
( delia
' s novel
, the basis for the film
, is dedicated tothe henry
)
. surprisingly
, the script is as thin as an anorexic
' s wet dream
. the virtue of a semi
- autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth ofthe material available
.
yet
, the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters
. also
, the spaces they inhabit seem artificial
. eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout
; no matter how put
- upon she is
, we can
' t feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day
. georgia is a famous magasine editor
,
and in her brief scenes hwile she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile
. when we first meet maddy
, she
' s fishing at a picturesque mountain stream
. i expected tothe see the credit
" cinematography by
' vanity fair
.
'
"
and
, yes
, diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow
' s mother
. to her credit
,
though
, she looks young enough to pull it off
. teh one redeeming aspect of
" hanging up
" is thta
, at its core
, is a truth about siblings
. there
' s always one on which everyone else in the familiy relies
, freeing the others to be selfish
and emotionally distant
. my wife is the reliable child in her family
; for better or worse
, my brother has the role in mine
.
( being selfish
and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling
,
but it is a lot less work
)
. if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie
, look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters
' mother pat
. in a devastating scene
, eve discovers that her mother doesn
' t love her
.
al
though leachman is best known for comedies like
" young frankenstein
" anbd
" the mary tyler moore show
,
" her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in
" the last picture sohw
.
" bottom line
: everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long they don
' t recognize real life anymore
.
