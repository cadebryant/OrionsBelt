my inner flag was at half
- mast last year when nick at nite pulled
" dragnet
" reruns off teh air
. sure
, i
' d seen them all at least once
, bu i coudl allways count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra
- sereous jack webb when there was nothing else on tv
. even
though
" dragnet
" is out of circulation at the moent
, we webb anti
- fans still have the d
. i
.
, a 50
' s propag
anda piece for thte military that is almost as hilarious as the famous
" blue boy
" episode of
" dragnet
.
" for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb
' s repid
- fier speeches
and straight
- faced seriousness
, think of the d
. i
. as whta would happen if sgt
. joe friday ever enlisted
, because he plays exactly the smae character here
, a no
- nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation
and loves to give long
- winded
, melodramatic speeches on any topic
. in tihs election year
, i
' m more convinced than ever that webb
and bob dole were separated at birth
. tjhe movie opens infact characteristic fashion as oney recruit after another knocks on webb
' s office door
and enters
. he gives each oney a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up
. the
" produced
and directed by jack webb
" card pretty much goes without saying
. this is his movie all the way
,
and after the first twenty mintues of him chewing outloud his recruits for no reason
, i was wondering if htere would even be a plot
. i certainly would have been entertained by an hour
and a half of trademark webb rants
,
but the d
. i
. gives us more
-
- much omre
. webb
' s mission is to amke a man out ofthe private owens
, tyhe local screw
- up
. the captain gives webb threee dyas to convert owens inot marine material or
, the captain will
" personally cut the lace off his panties
and ship him out myself
.
"
( whether the
" lace panties
" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered
.
) this
, ofthe course
, gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens
' life a living hell
. for those of you who haven
' t been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching
, here
' s a reprint of a typical monologue of his
. i can
' t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper
,
but the words should at least partially convey what i
' m talking about
.
.
.
" now you listen to me
, youngster
. someday you
' ll wake up fighting onthe a beach annd you
' ll pray to god somebody doesn
' t get killed because of your foolishness
.
.
. i
' ve got a headline for you
: every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours
, you
' re gonna turn around
and i
' ll be st
anding right there
.
" i couldn
' t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d
. i
.
( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame
)
, bu i tried to include some ofthe the more noteworthy lines
, like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day
' s work by going tothe yhe local bar
( where he orders a tomato juice
)
. he meets a woman who
, coincidentally
, also orders tomato juice
but walks away from a typically
- stimulating conversation whith webb to flirt with his arch
- rival
, another marine d
. i
. webb marches over to the table
, gets up in her face adn says
,
" just what kind of a dame do you think ytou are
?
" bogart he ain
' t
. the other d
. i
. gets one ofthe the few memorable non
- webb lines when he confesses to hte girl
,
" he
' s a damn good d
. i
.
.
.
. i guess i
' m just a little jealous
.
" join the club
, we
' re all jealous of jack webb
' s way with women
, which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene
, as webb finds his way to the woman
' s place of employment
, a lingerie store
,
and st
ands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display
.
" you expect me to talk tothe you
.
.
. in
_ here
_
?
!
" he exclaims
, no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras
. the woman goes off to help a customer
, leaving webb to fend forthe himself once again in this palace of estrogen
. a little girl spots him in thge store
and dem
ands
,
" what are you doing in here
.
.
. you
' re a man
, aren
' t you
?
" he doesn
' t reply
,
but you nkwo he
' s thinking in his head
,
" what an odd species of human
-
- so small
. must be one of those children everyone
' s been talking about
.
" this poor girl
, scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb
, owudl later swear off the male gender entirely
, just one of the many lesbian conversions he
' s reponsible for
. the movie doesn
' t focus too closely on webb
' s romance
, it also continues the owens subplot with probablly the most memorable scene in the entire movie
, where webb forces his platoon to spend tghe entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of theri drills
. after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea
, webb asks owens
,
" ws that flea ytou killed a male or female
?
" owens replies
,
" a male
, sir
.
" webb yells to the platoon
,
" this ain
' t the one
!
" that such a scene
( along with the rest of the movie
) was intended to be tooked seriously defies comment
.
but we knwo it was all presented with tjhe utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not onyl fo their coperation in the making of the d
. i
.
,
but for iwo jima
, guadalcanal adn every otehr major battle ofthe the first half of the 20th century
. webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie
( with the exception ofthe owens
) were played by actuall marines
. someone wanting to parody this movie couldn
' t do a more comical job than webb did
. it makes it all the more ironic
( like raeeyain on your wedding day
) that the man had no sense of humor himself
. there
' s a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something
and one of them breaks into laughter
. webb bursts in the room
and shouts
,
" what did i tell you about laughing
?
!
" to which tghe private replies
,
" sir
, only nine
- year
- old girls laugh
, sir
!
"
and let me tell you
, i was as happy as a nine
- year
- old girl while watching this movie
.
