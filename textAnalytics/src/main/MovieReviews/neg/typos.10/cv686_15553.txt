look
! thge new version ofthe
" psycho
" came outloud
and the world didn
' t end
! i guess gus van sant really isn
' t the bringer of the apocalypse
! unfortunately
,
though
, that
" psycho
" didn
' t end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it
. van sant
' s controversial
" re
- telling
" of alfred hitchcock
' s classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere
( even before it premiered
.
) without benefit of an actual viewing
, many have said that the film will
, at best
, suck
. being an
( almost
) good critic
, i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film
, at best
, sucked
(
and that concludes the use of the word
" suck
"
and
, hopefully
, the
thoughts that i am a brain
- dead orangutan
.
) director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film
and refilmed it
, shot
- for
- shot
, using the same
, exact script
( with a few minor alterations
.
) the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful
and scary
, even
though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time
. suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able tothe create something new or different than the original
. sadly
, that did not occur
. it is hard to be overshaddowed by vera miles
and john gavin
( from the original
" psycho
)
,
but that is waht exactly happened to julianne moore
and viggo mortensen
. inthe moore
' s case
, the film would have been helped if
" the x
- files
" gillian
anderson had been cast instead
; especially since moore goes thru tghe entire film doing a scully impression
! from the cold demeanor
and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence
, moore isnt scully
! mortensen
( who i liked in
" g
. i
. jane
"
) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy
/ hick
, which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point
. sam has a twang
and a cowboy hat
,
but that
' s about it
. mortensen turns inthe one of tjhe most uptight performance in recent memmory
. anne heche
, infront yhe janet leigh role
, does a faw good things inspite her brief time onthe screen
. at least her marion crane has a little life in her
, which can
' t be said for most of the rest of tje cast
. the best work
,
though
, comes from vince vaughn
, as hte demented mama
' s boy
, norman bates
. he
' s not oging to make anyone forget anthony perkins
,
but he is effective both in being naughty
and nice
. the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche
and vaughn
, where they simply talk
. there is smoe solid acting there
, something thast is not carried through the rest of the film
. van sant hasnt made a boring film
. all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently utilizied in 1960 aren
' t as eye
- catching now
. what passed for brilliance
then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they don
' t impress or excite
. van sant
, in wqat i asume is a grasp at originality
, decided to put some stream
- of
- consciousness images into a few famoust scenes
( was that a lamb in the middle of the road
?
) these images
, included with some questionable editing choices
, took away from tje scenes themselves
and caused
, at first
, bewilderment
and
, later
, laughter
. definitely not hitchcock
' s intention
! at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmann
' s original famous
and terrific score
. if a film like
" psycho
" does not frighten
,
then what
' s the point
. aside from norman
, the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with tje audience
. there are things van sant
and company could have done to at least mkae their recreation interesting
. in the end
,
however
, tje new
" psycho
" isnt a noble attempt
,
but
, alas
, a dismal failure
.
