" tarzan
and teh lost city
" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in qutie a while
. not onyl it is poorly written
, badly acted
,
and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas
, it is thoroughly uninspired
and insipid
. unfortunately
, it
' s not bad in the way great
, colossal misfires like
" heaven
' s gate
"
( 1980
) or
" ishtar
"
( 1987
) were bad
. instead
, it literally drips off the screen like a movei nobody wanted to be associated with
, which begs the question of why it was made in yhe firt place
. with all the good scripts lieing around hollywood un
- produced
, how does needless drek like this make its way tothe the big screen
? of course
, tarzan is oney ofthe the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history
- he has appeared inaddition over forty films
, which hve ranged from the very good
( 1984
' s
" greystoke
: teh legend of tarzan
, lord of the apes
"
) down tothe the really bad
( 1981
' s
" tarzan
, the ape man
" with bo derek
)
. most of these films were just cheapie b
- movies made in the thirties
and forties
, starring ex
- olympic athletes
and a lot of cutsie chimps
. therefore
, if anohter tarzan movie is to be made
, one might assume tht it would have something new to offer
- a different angl
, an original storyline
, anything to set it apart from all the others
.
" greystoke
" added a never
- before
- seen level ofthe realism to the pulpy tale
,
and even
" tarzan
, tyhe ape man
" at least had the mis
- guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek
' s bare breasts
.
" tarzan
and the lost city
,
" on the other h
and
, hasnt absolutely nothing tothe offer
but a bunch of recycled storylines
and bad dialogue
. the script
, by bayard johnson
and j
.
anderson black is about as formulaic
and generic as they come
. comic books have better plots than this
. the movie is so bad
, in fatc
, that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer
' s comedy
" george of the jungle
.
" didn
' t the producers think to leave that back in the ood weissmuller pictures where it belongs
? the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established
: a quick oppening narration tells of tarzan
( casper van dien
) bieng found in the jungle after having been raised by apes
,
and his return to engl
and where he assumes his greystoke heritage
. whn the movie starts in 1913
, he is a civilized english gentleman
( without an english accent
)
,
and he is to marry jane
( jane march
) in less than a week
.
however
, when a wicked archeologist
/ grave
- robber named nigel ravens
( steve waddington
) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar
, one of africa
' s last great secrets
, the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle
. at first
, jane refuses tothe go
, pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding
;
but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind
and tracks him down
, therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her adn her ape
- man
. once the film gets gogin
( in its own sluggish way
)
, it delves into a series of jungle adventures
, as tarzan
, jane
, annd the natives attempt the thwart ravens
and his crew from dicovering the city
. most of the so
- called adventures are cheesy
, predictable
, adn unexciting
, with no pace
, tension
, or action to speak of
. there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies
, ranging from
" raiders of the lost ark
"
( 1981
) to
" the goonies
"
( 1985
)
. when the movie is running short on action
, it includes a few greenpeace
- friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals
, releasing a baby elphant from a trap
,
and throwing ivory tusks into the river
. the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality
. for instance
, when tarzan
- who was raised in the jungle
- is bit by a cobra
, he doesn
' t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi
- experienced weekend backpacker would do
. instead
, he ties a tourniquet around his arm
and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival
. ofthe course
, one can
' t help
but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is
. not to ruin the ending or anything
,
but there is no lost city
. there is
,
however
, a lost pyramid
, which i suppose is all the resource
- strapped fx department coudl come up with
( thte special effects are not worthy of a made
- for
- tv movie
)
. hwihc also brings up the question ofthe why tyhe treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid
, when it
' s sitting right out in the middle of an open field
? strictly speaking
,
" tarzan
and the lost city
" isn
' t even bad enough to have camp quality
,
al
though casper van dien
' s laughably stiff performance comes real close
. this movie proves what
" starship troopers
" only hinted at
: he cannot act
,
but he sure looks well
- groomed
, even in the deepest heart of the african jungle
. van dien is much too much of a pretty
- boy to be an effective tarzan
; he
' s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth
. i also wondered what the make
- up department was thinking whn it outfitted him with that awful circa
- 1983 steve perry haircut
. waddington makes a decent villain
,
al
though he
' s like a charmless version of belloq from
" raiders of the lost ark
.
" as jane
, the ex
- model jane march has little to do
but smile
and look pretty next to tarzan
. she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two
,
but whenever a snake comes into the picture
, she is reduced to a hysterical mess
. howver
, amidst all htis complaining
, i do have one piece of good news
.
" tarzan
and the lost city
" isnt so lacking in ideas both new
and old
, that it is unable to fill even an hour
and a half of celluloid
. so
, we can say tihs much for it
: at least it had the decency to be short
.
