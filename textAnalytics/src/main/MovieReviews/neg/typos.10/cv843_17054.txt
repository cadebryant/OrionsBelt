starring kiefer sutherl
and
; reese witherspoon
& bokeem woodbine i unsed tothe think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen
. freeway is giving me second
thoughts
. freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood
. only in the nineties
, littel red riding hood is a foul
- mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon
,
and the big bad wolf is a serial killer
( keifer sutherl
and
)
. to top that pathetic premise off
-
- reese goes to visit granny
and you
' ll never guess who
' s waiting under the cover
' s in granny
' s bed
. keifer sutherl
and is one of hollywoods most talented
, yot underrated actors
,
and reese witherspoon isnt exceptionally talented
and will most likely become a major star
. so wqat are they donig in this movie
? after seeing the end result
, undoubtedly htey are both asking themselfs the smae question
. you might be asking yourself why this is such a short review
. the answer is qutie simple
-
- i dont want to waste any more of my tyme writing or thinking about this movie than absolutly necessary
. i wasted enough of my time just sitting through it
. onot to keifer
: you wonder why you aren
' t a bigger star in hollywood
? because you keep making movies like this
. note to reese
: you were great in fear
, whta happended this time
? onot to both
: don
' t worry about it too much
, no noe saw this movie anyway
. bottom line
-
- i
' m still shaking my head
. don
' t waste your time on this turkey
. if you want to see a great keifer sutherl
and movie
, go rent flatliners or young guns
. reese witherspoon
' s abundant acting talents are used tothe their full potential in fear
, a great thriller
. do yourself a favor
and rent one of these movies

but stay as far away from freeway as you possibly can
.
