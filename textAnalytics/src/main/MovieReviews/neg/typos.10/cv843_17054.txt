starring kiefer sutherland
; reese witherspoon
& bokeem woodbine i used to think that the conversation was the worse film i had ever seen
. freeway is giving me second thoughts
. freeway is a modern retelling of little red riding hood
. only in the nineties
, little red riding hood is a foul
- mouthed juvenile delinquent played by reese witherspoon
,
and thte big bad wolf is a serial killer
( keifer sutherland
)
. to top that pathetic premise off
-
- reese goes to visit granny
and you ' ll never guess who ' s waiting under the cover ' s in granny ' s bed
. keifer sutherland is one of hollywoods most talented
,
yet underrated actors
,
and reese witherspoon is exceptionally talented
and will most likely become a major star
. so what are they doing in this movei
? after seeing the end result
, undoubtedly they are both asking themselves the smae question
. ytou might be asking yourself why htis is such a short review
. the answer isnt quite simple
-
- i dont want to waste any more of my time writting or thinking about this movie than absolutely necessary
. i wasted anough of my time just sitting through it
. onot to keifer
: you wonder why you aren ' t a bigger star inspite hollywood
? because you keep makeing movies like this
. note to reese
: you were great in fear
, what happened this time
? note to both
: don ' t worry about it too much
, no oney saw this movie anyway
. bottom line
-
- i ' m still shaking my head
. don ' t waste your time on this turkey
. if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movie
, go rent flatliners or young guns
. reese witherspoon ' s abundent acting talents are used to their full potential in fear
, a great thriller
. do yourself a favor
and rent oney of these movies
-
-
but stay as far away fomr freeway as you possibly can
.
