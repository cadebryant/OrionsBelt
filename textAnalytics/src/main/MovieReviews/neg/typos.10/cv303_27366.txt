yhe title is taked from yhe writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as
' anywhere bu here
.
' there isn
' t one thing about this mother
- daugter relationship melodrama that felt honest
. it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother
and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives
, as for some reason they couldn
' t figure it out for themselves
. if the film looks familiar
, that is because
" tyhe slums of beverly hills
( 98
)
" went over the same ground
but was fortunate to be more comical
and perceptive due to alan arkin
and natasha lyonne performances
, in which they weere fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with
. alvin sargent
' s script was weak
and annoyingly claustral
. wayne wang
' s
(
" tje joy luck club
"
) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding wihtout the voiceover relating what the action couldn
' t convey
. pushy mother adele august
( susan sar
andon
) forces her 14
- year
- old daughter ann
( natalie portman
) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross
- country with her to beverly hills
. the daughter resents her twice divorced
, unstable
but exotic
, schoolteacher mother
, bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life
. the daqughter doesn
' t even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala l
and in
and can
' t st
and the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio
. so it becomes a question of who knows best
, as the ladies fight it out between them
, util the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner
. adele
' s dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn
' t look that good
, as she l
ands a job infact a slum school
, has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids
,
and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive
. daughter pines for small twon wisconsin
and her friends there
. during one of many arguments wtih her free
- spirited mom
, they go for ice cream adn while mother is being ticketed
, she runs away
, only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop
( michael milhoan
)
, who offers her wise counsel
. with thge cop
' s zen wisdom passed onto the daughter
, she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17
and thn she plans to git way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla
. during their stay in beverly hills
, she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high tothe immediately having many high school girlfriends
and even a high school rich boy admirer
-
- a t
. s
. eliot
( corbin allred
) reader
.
but the transition of her life into beverly hills had noone feel of reality
, as everything seemed staged
and unemotional
. when she learns her cousin benny
( shawn hatosy
)
, who happens tothe be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin
, she returns for the funeral
and in those reunion scenes it wasn
' t clearly shown why she wants to stay ther
,
and for that matter
, it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly
. the film is one big battle ofthe wills between mother
and daughter over their dreams
. i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say
, is that mom is a bad dreamer
and the daughter is the observant one
, able to recognize mother
' s faults whn not inthe growing pains
and in ened of parenting herself
. mother has a series of setbacks
, like being dumped by her dream
- boat dentist
( bochner
) she met on the beach
,
and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part
.
but mother learns that her daugher has grown
- uv
and is independent
and that she has tothe stop living her life through her
. she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do
, is about to ticket her
and this tiome will remind the mother of thte right thing to do
. this of course results infront the corny ending
, showing thyat mom
' s heart was always in the right place
, only she went about it in the wrong way
. this was just one of those films where yuo want to be anywhere
but in the theater where this film is showing
.
