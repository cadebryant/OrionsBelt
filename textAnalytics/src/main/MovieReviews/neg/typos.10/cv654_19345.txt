ytou think that these people only exist in the movies
, bu trust me
, they
' re as rela as life
. i once talked to a guy who
thought tjhe united states government ws putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person
' s brain with microwaves
.
then i sat in a room full of peopel who believed that the government rigged state elections
. i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products forthe the specfic goal of getting people addicted
. these people had what are known as
" conspiracy theories
"
- ideas about how unseen forces wrok to deceive
and control the public
. a little imagination goes a long way
. in richard donner
' s conspiracy theory
, jerry fletcher
( mel gibson
) is a new york city cab driver who seems to ahve a conspiracy theory about everything
. his latest
, that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle
, might sound outrageous to us
,
but is all in a day
' s owrk for him
. he combs the newspaper
, looking fo tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings
- on behind the scenes
,
and from there jerry draws his conclusions
. upst
anding citizen that he is
, he tries to convince alice sutton
( julia roberts
) of tyhe justice deparment that the president must be warned
. lucky gal
, alice
, who met jerry when he saved her from a cuple of muggers
and has had tothe listen to his theories during the six monthes since
. what she doesn
' t know is that jerry
' s interest in her is far more than
, well
, professional
. he goes to great lengths to follow her around
and watch her inthe her own apartment
.
but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry
' s ideas
and his limited
- circulation
" conspiracy theory
" newsletter
, he finds himself in danger anbd in real need of alice
' s help
. one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it trys to pass itself off as an action
- thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action
, nor a signifigant number of thrills
. part of this is a result of the film
' s slow pace
. it takes forever to set up the relationship bewteen jerry
and alice
,
and even once tyhat is over with
, the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom tht every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement
. at over two hours
, this film could have beeen significantly condensed
and had it
' s running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour
,
but even thn
, the action scenes would nto be able to save the film
. instead ofthe truly exciting
and engaging set pieces
, we
' re treated to a few ofthe the generic scenes with tjhe requisite
" black elements
"
: black helecopter
, men in black action suits
and body armor
, black vehicles
- you know the drill
. they cmo on down with all kinds ofthe neat gadgets
and weapons
,
but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories
and some chick with no training somehow manaze to elude them eveyr time
. big deal
, we
' ve seen it all before
. watching the film
, i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination
,
but i was out of luck
. now
, when i say it took forever to set up the
" relationship
" between jerry
and alice
, i completely mean what one person is relative to the other
,
and not romantic involvement
. oh
, donner
and screenwriter brian helgel
and would liuke you to believe that by the end of hte movie
, the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other
,
but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring
. you see
, there were more sparks between gibson
and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies
( also directed by donner
) thna between gibson
and roberts in conspiracy theory
. the twpo just don
' t click
,
and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether
( liuke finding out he
' s been stalking her
)
, the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced
. the script in general also seems forced
, like someone sat helgel
and down
and forced him to write it
,
then took it anbd forced it upon us
. dialog is undistinguished
and rether unmemorable
, to the point that i almost stoped listening
. even gibson
' s usual gift for ad lib couldn
' t punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest
,
al
though one of jerry
' s theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing
. unfourtunately
, much of what
' s dicussed in the film is nto inherantly important to what
' s going on
,
but instead filler that starts out with potential
,
but ends up just being extraneous because it
' s never followed through
. for example
, jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was catually murdered by the government inthe a new york subway staion
. he even goes so far as to explain that the staion was flooded at the timne due to a water main break
( hence the water in a subway staion
)
,
and that the coroner should check the man
' s lungs for chlorine
. this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to belieev him
. yuo know waht happens
then
? nothing
, zip
, nada
. no follow
- up whatsoever
, so whta
' s the significance
? okay
, here
' s anohter one
. a couple of well known
( real life
) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j
. d
. salinger novel
" the catcher in the rye
"
. jerry also has a bunch of copies
. whenever he goes into a bookstore
, he has to buy one
. leaving outloud the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin
, we
' re never given a reason tothe believe why this owudl make him an assassin
. not when we find out about his salinger collection
, nto when he goes to the bookstore
, not later on when we get the answer to our first question
. the point becomes totally extraneous
. oh
, did i mention that patrick stewart isnt in this film
? yeah
, he plays this governmnet psychiatrist named dr
. jonas who may or may not be a bad guy
. that
' s about it
. for all the presence htis usually marvelous actor has
, he
' s nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory
. you can just lump him infront with the supporting players
, with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi
. this guy was really likable
,
and i wish he
and his character hadnt gotten mroe screen time
. okay
, here
' s my theory
. this really started out as a great film
,
but some of its jokes were actually true
! tje government cameback in
and forced donner tothe mkae edits for the sake of national security
,
and thsi was what was left over
.
