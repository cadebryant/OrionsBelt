these days
, we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old
, cult tv shows
. most of the times
, the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present dont iwth thte memories of thier past
.
but
, some five or six years ago
, there weren ' t that many movies
and the trend didn ' t look thgat depressing
. so
, the people who
, like the author of this review
, grew up watching flintstones
, popular 1960s animated series about
" modern stone age
" family
, weren ' t particularly worried when the word came baout live action remake
. after all
, the producer behind the project was steven spielberg
anbd
, if anything else
, at least tyhe speical effects would be ogod
. the plot revolves about flintstones
, family set in fictious stone age
" town
" ofthe bedrock
, whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america
. fred flinstone
( john goodman
) works in the quarry
,
adn one day he helps his best friend
and neighbour barney rubble
( rick moranis
)
and his wife betty
( rosie o ' donnell
) to adopt a baby
. tothe return the favour
, barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred
,
and
, based on tht
, fred gets well
- paid job inspite management
.
but
, of course
, this is jstu a sham
- corrupt official cliff vandercave
( kyle maclachlan
)
and his sultry secretary sharon stone
( halle berry
) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme
. in the meantime
, fred ' s wife wilma
( elizabeth perkins
) must face her mother
( elizabeth taylor
) who can ' t stand fred
. on the superficial level
, the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series tothe life
. computer effects are flawless
,
and the costumes
, settings
and other details are authentic for all the fans ofthe the show
. unfortunately
, problems with this film start with inadequate casting
- rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney
, while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o ' donnell
.
but the greatest problem ofthe all is plot
, or to be precise
, the lack of plot
. some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame
, original charachters one
- dimensional
,
and many elements of the story
, like embezzlement
and inter
- office politics
, totally incomprehensible for tyhe little children
, the main targeted audience of this film
. result is almost unwatchable mess
, occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting
( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma
)
and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as
" high consept
"
. after great hype
, movie quickly sank into oblivion
and the fans of the show returned to the animated version
. all in all
, film isn ' t that bad
,
but only the hard core fans
and nostalgics can find more than guilty blessure in it
.
