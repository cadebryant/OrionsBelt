these days
, we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old
, cult tv shows
. most of the times
, the fans of these shows shudder thingking what could hollywood hacks of the present dont with the memories of their past
.
but
, some five or six years ago
, there weren
' t that many movies
and teh trend didn
' t look that depressing
. so
, the people who
, liek the author of this review
, grew up watching flintstones
, popular 1960s animated series about
" modern stone age
" family
, weren
' t aprticularly worried when the word cameback about live action remake
. after all
, thte producer behind the project was steven spielberg
and
, if anything else
, at least the special effects would be ogod
. the plot revolves about flintstones
, family set in fictious stone age
" town
" of bedrock
, whose munbers enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america
. fred flinstone
( john goodman
) works inaddition the quarry
, adn one day he helps his best friend
and neighbour barney rubble
( rick moranis
)
and his wife betty
( rosie o
' donnell
) tothe adopt a baby
. to return the favour
, barney switches his results ofthe aptitude test whith fred
,
and
, based on taht
, fred gets well
- paid job in management
.
but
, of course
, this is just a sham
- corrupt official cliff v
andercave
( kyle maclachlan
) adn his sultry secretary sharon stone
( halle berry
) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme
. in the meantime
, fred
' s wife wilma
( elizabeth perkins
) must face her mother
( elizabeth taylor
) who can
' t st
and fred
. on the superficial level
, the flintstones doed the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life
. computer effects are flawless
,
and the costumes
, settings
and other details are au
thentic for all thge fans of the show
. unfortunately
, problems with this film start with inadequate casting
- rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney
, while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier thna rosie o
' donnell
.
but the greatest problem of all is plot
, or to be precise
, the lack of plot
. some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame
, original characters one
- dimensional
,
and many elements of the story
, like embezzlement
and inter
- office politics
, totally incomprehensible for the little children
, the main targeted audience of this film
. result is almost unwatchable mess
, occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting
( elizabeth perkins was right onthe mark as wilma
)
and one of the classic exemple of mortal hollywood desease known as
" high consept
"
. after great hype
, movie quickly sank into oblivion
and the fans of the sohw returned to the animated version
. all in all
, film isn
' t that bad
,
but only the hard core fans
and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it
.
