watching the movie
, i vowed tothe substract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup
, cute
' n cuddly
, computer
- generated monkey
. if the monkey died
, the movie got an extra half star
. alas
, the monkey showed up at the end
, unharmed
, to the wet sickly sound ofthe gagging
and rolling eyeballs
. what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars
. that
' s pretty generous
, considering the movie
' s camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek
. when iwll robinson
( jack johnson
) teaches his pet robot about friendship
, yuo are actually supposed to buy it
. so why such a seamingly high rating
? there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the exprience with the garbage
. first
, we saw hte movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a br
and newyorker theater
. the sound
and screen kicked ass
. nobody in the country enjoied tghe movei as much as my audience did
(
and i don
' t necessarily mean that in a good way
)
. also
, there were moreso than zero scenes where i foudn myself rooting forthe the robinsons
, or getting caught up in the movie
' s tension
. i even liked the computer
- generated settings
. i ususally prefer to see models or sets
,
but yhe cg was more detailed than i
' ve seen in a lot of movies
; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities
. aslo
, gary oldman is never a bad actor
, even
though he is typecast as a villain
. william hurt isn
' t too bad either
. neither actor had a great role
, bu their performances were watchable
.
and prehaps i shouldn
' t admit this
,
but something about the tone
and outlook of the movie brought me bakc to my childhood
. there is very little swearing or blood
; there is a strong moral message
, saccharine
though it is
; there is a bit of romance
( whose culmination after 2 hours is a
" real
" kiss
-
- no sex
)
. it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked foward to when i was six
. those movies were probaly as bad as lost in space
,
but at the time
, they were manna from heaven
. that type of moviemaking is a lost art
. now for the bad news
. worst
and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue
. it
' s squeaky
- clean
, familiy fun
, trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction
.
" you better hold on to your joystick
,
" is one such line
.
and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs
, they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign
. second worst
,
and closely related
, is the screenplay
. the story
' s exposition takes place at a press conference
, which allows the writers to explain wqat
' s happening with the least amount of creativity
, effort
, or interest
. once the story gets going
, i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while
,
but on the whole
, the situations that arise are silly
and contrived
. when gary oldman easily reprograms will
' s pet robot to kill the robinsons
, my friend summed it up perfectly
:
" he flipped the switch to
' evil
.
'
"
then there
' s teh tone of tjhe movie
. the colorado daily said the film owudl have beeen more interesting if the central character was will robinson
and not his father john robinson
.
then it could be an adventure movie
. htey
' re mostly right
, except that johnson
( will
) wasn
' t a good enough actor to carry it off
. still
, that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination
. jstu because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn
' t mean that we have to bow to a
" promise keepers
" notion of who
' s hte center of a family
. many quality family films have beeen made with a non
- traditional family sturcture
( fly away home comes to mind
) tothe much better effect
.
and tje politics of the time seem a bit conservative
and regressive for a futuristic movie
. in star wars
, the rebels were the good guys
. we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system
. in lost in space
, the rebels are the bad guys
, a terrorist force that must be killed
, crushed
and silenced so that our children may live free
. that ominous excuse forthe violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists
. finally
, a few specfic details deserve critisism
. the movie tells us thyat the setting is the year 2056
. why
? why bother saying what year this is
. just tell us it
' s the future
. i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997
. setting a specific date only dates the movie
and guarantees that it won
' t be timeless
( not that this movie was really in the running anyway
.
)
.
then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole
. this silly waste ofthe money reminded me of bugs bunny
' s barber chair
,
and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven
' t learned a thing about ergonomics
. noe vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succede where the rest of the film failed
: it made lost in space look kool
. the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue adn
, out of context
, made it sound hip
. tihs is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie
.
but if that
' s the best part of tjhe movie
, i cxan
' t in good consceince recommend it
. still
, if you get stuck seeing it
, as we did
, you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance
, think of liking bad movies as a child
,
and bring allong your
" bad movie bingo
" cards
.
