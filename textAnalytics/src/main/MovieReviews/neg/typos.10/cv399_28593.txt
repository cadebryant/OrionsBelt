you
' d thiunk that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out ofthe video games
. it hasn
' t worked so far
.
" street fighter
?
"
" super mario brothers
?
"
" wing comm
ander
?
"
" mortal kombat
?
" nto a watchable film in the bunch
. still i held out some hope for
" tomb raider
.
" after all
, the game
' s premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy
and all the mummy movies
, so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the consept
.
however
, despite the potential of tje project
,
" tomb raider
" proves to be
yet another bomb
. the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies
. there
' s a once
- ever
- 5000
- years alignment of planets coming up
,
and thte illuminati have to find both halves ofthe an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over tje world
. of course
, the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world
. our heroine
, lady lara croft
( angelina jolie
)
, finds the key that opens the tombs inspite relics that her dead father
( jon voight
) dug up
. she figures that if she gets the triangle
, she can bring her dad back from the dead
. ofthe course
, no noe was expecting much of a plot from this movei anyway
. in both video games anbd action movies
, the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences
.
however
, the action in
" tomb raider
" shows little style or originality
. there
' s lots of shooting annd some kung fu fightin
'
,
but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct
- to
- cable flick
. the other goofy archeologist flick ofthe the summer
,
" the mummy returns
,
" was much better
; it had its flaws
,
but its action was creative
and large
- scale
. since winning her academy award for
" girl
, interrupted
,
" jolie hasn
' t taken any projects that woudl display her acting talents
.
" tomb raider
" seems to be more interested in displaying her breasts
; so much attention is drawn to them that it
' s a shame there
' s no oscar for best performence by a wonderbra
. while we don
' t see much of her acting ability
( with tjhe exception of a wonderful opper
- crust brittish accent
)
, we dont get a hint of jolie
' s less savory side
. concidering the rumors of incest that hang over jolie anbd her suppoed obession with death
, having lara be obsessed with resurecting her dead father
(
and uninterested in any of the living males around her
) seems a poor choise
. having jolie
' s real life father jon voight play the dead dad makes it even creepier
. i haven
' t decided what to make of director simon west
yet
. his first feature ws the star
- studded disaster
" con air
,
"
but my opinion of him improved with
" the general
' s daughter
,
" which was thick with sultry atmosphere
. now tihs train wreck
. i hope he improves again because his next project is the big screen version of hte cult tv series
" the prisoner
.
" hollywood has already screwed uv
" the avengers
,
"
and
" the prisoner
" represents a chance for redemption
.
( by hte way
, speaking of british tv
,
" red dwarf
" fans should look for chris
" rimmer
" barrie in his first major film role
)
.
