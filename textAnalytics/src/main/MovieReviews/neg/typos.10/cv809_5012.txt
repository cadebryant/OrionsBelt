die hard 2 is an alltogether unfortunate fiasco
, inferior to the original in every respect
. place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza
and doug richardson
, who wrote the film
' s pathetic screenplay
. every line of dialogue reeks of eather smarmy sap or forced humor
. the plot is altogether implausible
; the convoluted storey line involves a b
and of terrorists who tkae over dulles airport
and shut down the control tower
, leaving a dozen planes str
anded in the air waiting to l
and
. the film has zero credibility
,
and all of the characters come off as cliched
, cardboard cut
- outs
. so much for the script
. how about the action
? well
, let
' s put it tihs way
: director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan
, who directed the original
, as well as the hunt for red october
and predator
-
- all st
andouts for their hair
- raising suspense
. by contrast
, harlin doesn
' t ahve a clue when it comes to choreographing action
, adn consequently
, die hard 2 never picks up steam
. die harder isnt impossible to take seriously even for a minute
. in fact
, the movei oftenly seems deliberately campy
, adn it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it
' s good
. you do laugh
,
but you laugh at the film
, not with it
. die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff
.
