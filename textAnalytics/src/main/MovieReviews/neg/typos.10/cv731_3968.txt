we could paraphrase michelle pfieffer
' s character in dangerous minds anbd say that beyond rangoon starts with an
" a
.
" that
' s fair enough
. all movies
, like all school childrens
, should be given the benefit of the doubt
. the chance tothe seceed
. after all
, we liuke to tihkn that the right combination of talent
and effort can do wonders
. mountains can be moved
,
and good movies can be made
. yeah right
. children fail
, as do films
. as does director john boorman
' s latest
. the success of beyond rangoon hinges on the believability of patricia arquette
( ed wood
, true romance
) as the busty westerner
- in
- peril w
andering baout 1988 burma without a passport
.
though we can stomach the mild plot contrivances thta get her there
, it
' s a tougher task to overlook the actress
. she
' s a lightweight
. as the first scene
( with narration
!
) demonstrates
, she doesn
' t ahev
* nearly
* enough range for the emotions that her character
-
- a mother fleeing yhe memories ofthe a murdered husb
and
and son
-
- is supposed tothe sohw
. she may give a stronger performance than
, say
, keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds
, by not by much
. beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film
, thanks tothe the practiced craftsmanship ofthe john boorman
( deliverance
, excalibur
, hope
and glory
)
. he keeps the narrative moving
, no marter how muddy the story
-
- or the heroine
-
- gets
. why he chose arquette remains a mystery
,
though
. maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies
.
but even after an hour of half
- stated political statements
and murky mass killings
, we
* still
* don
' t know enough ofthe what
' s happening in this country to feel distressed for the characters or their situations
. empty exoticism
. the technical credits in beyond rangoon are a curious mix
, combining lush jungle photography witht bad blue
- screen work
. also odd is the obvious dubbing
. done to make some of the foreign characters sound less foreign
?
and
, is it my mistake
, or do the same extras keep reappearing as different soldiers
?
? doo doo doo doo
