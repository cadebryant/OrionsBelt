the new austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties
. produce something
, anything
, that will get the high school
and iunior high kids in the theater because tehy buy more soda
and popcorn than senior citizens
. the usual hallmarks ofthe this filmmaking tradition are all here
. gross humor
, sex jokes
, silly sight gags
, more sex jokes
.
anbd the film is a strong contender inwhich the current race to be cruder
, grosser
and moreso outrageous than that last film
. what the film is not
,
however
, is funny
. the plot centers around the return of dr
. evil
, who goes back in time to steal austin powers ' mojo
( a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin ' s pelvis
) which gives austin his sexual prowess
and the karisma to defeat his enemies
. austin must go aftter him
,
and returns to the swinging sixties where free love
and sexy sceret agents had their hayday
. i allmost avoided htis film because i did not like the original
.
but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehichle
and the film received many good reviews
. i wish i had stuck tothe my first impression
. myers is trying tothe be the jerry lewis of htis generation
.
and he has the talent to do it
, at least as an actor
.
but the material he is working with here
, much of it his own
, falls short of anything ressembling comic genius
. this movie tries to carry the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces
, a five
- hundered
- pound fat man ' s butt crack
,
and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year ood
. after some of theese scenes
, one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films wiull have to go to get an audiences attention
. the direction also helps the film achieve a new low point in cinematic humor
. for the most part
, i falt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show
. there is no sense ofthe comic timing or subtlety
. the director just throws the material at us
, giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera sould be a film director
. i am sure yhe film will have appeal to many of the under 22 crowd
, at least the noe ' s who have
yet to discover literacy
. certainly the movei is directed towards thge generation that prefers everything described as ' in your face
, kick you in the teeth
, take no prisoners
,
( action
- verb
+ blah blah blah
)
. ' if you see the film
annd you find you ' re not laughing
, there is nothing wrong with you
. it just means you grew uv since seventh grade
.
