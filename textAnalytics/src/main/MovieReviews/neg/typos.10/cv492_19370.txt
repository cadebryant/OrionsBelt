the newyorker austin powers film continues a movie tradition begun in the eighties
. produce something
, anything
, that will get the high school
and junoir high kids in the theater because they buy more soda
and popcorn than senoir citizens
. the usual hallmarks of this filmmaking tradition are all here
. gross humor
, sex jokes
, silly sight gags
, more sex jokes
.
and the film is a strong contender in the current race to be cruder
, grosser
and more outrageous than tht last film
. what the film isnt not
,
however
, is funny
. the plot centers around tje return of dr
. evil
, who goes back in time to steal austin powers
' mojo
( a liquid with red stuff in it extracted from austin
' s pelvis
) which gives austin his sexual prowess adn the charisma to defeat his enemies
. austin must go after him
,
and returns to the swinging sixties where free loev
and sexy secret agents had their heyday
. i almost avoided thsi film because i did not like the orginial
.
but the films premise sounded like an excellent comic vehicle
and the film received many good reviews
. i wish i had stuck to my first impression
. myers is trying to be the jerry lewis of this generation
.
and he has the talent to do it
, at least as an actor
. bu the material he is working with here
, much of it his own
, falls short of anytying resembling comic genius
. this movie tries to cary the day with sight gags about drinking distilled feces
, a five
- hundred
- pound fat man
' s
butt crack
,
and a barrage of sex jokes aimed at the level of the average 15 year old
. after some of these scenes
, one has to wonder how gross the next generation of films will have tothe go to get an audiences attention
. the direction allso helps the film achieve a newyorker low point in cinematic humor
. for the most part
, i felt as if i was watching a saturday morning chalderns live action tv show
. there is no sense ofthe comic timing or subtlety
. the directer jsut throws tjhe material at us
, giving us nothing except the hope that anyone with a camera could be a film director
. i am sure the film will hve appeal to many of the under 22 crowd
, at least the one
' s who have
yet to discover literacy
. certainly the movie is directed towards tyhe generation that prefers everyting described as
' in your face
, kick you in the teeth
, take no prisoners
,
( acation
- verb
+ blah blah blah
)
.
' if you see the film
and you fidn you
' re not laughing
, there is nothing wrong with you
. it just means you grew up since seventh grade
.
