plot
: a down
-
and
- out girl moves in with some over
- the
- top models
and falls in love with a goofy
-
but
- loveable guy from across the street
. aaaaaaaaah
!
then one day
, she sees him knock a woman upside the head wih a baseball bat
. ooooooooh
! she must thne join together with her model
- friends to find out whether or not this guy is really goofy
-
but
- loveable
, or a psycho killer
. aaaaaaaaah
! critique
: completely idiotic
. okay
, so maybe i
' m being a little too nice
. thsi movie starts off dumb
, moves into the ridiculous
and eventually graduates to idiocy
. there
.
.
. that
' s more like it
!
and how
, you may ask
? well
, it
' s simple raelly
. four of the dumbest stereotypical models in the world
( oh my god
, i just found out that tje actresses playing tje parts are models in real life
.
.
. yipes
!
) join monica potter
( in a role which can onyl be described as an obvious cry for help
) annd freddie prinze jr
.
( not the actor
,
but thte charactor better known as freddie prinze jr
.
)
, in a plot so stupid
and far
- fetched
, that you have to wonder once more
, how crap liuke this gets by the hollywood bigwigs
. this thing stinks to high
- heaven
. it
' s jstu plain embarrassing for everyone involved
. i even felt my iq dip below its usual low as toilet humor somehow worked its way into thsi so
- called rumatic
- comedy
- acation movie
? ugh
. what a pile of dung
. hey
, i
' m actually starting to soudn a little like harry knowles here
,
but i guess i could see where his frustration comes from time to time
. it
' s sad really
. a movie which actually had quite a few people in my audience laughing at its idiocy
, including the over
- used
" folks hiding in tghe bathroom while someone else comes in to take a crap
and fart
" gag
.
and how about that dumb blonde modle who keeps running into things
. pure hilarity
! or maybe i
' m jstu too jaded
, too much of a critic
, not relaxed enough tothe enjoy this fluff
- piece
.
.
. uuuhhmmm
.
.
. naaaaah
!
! this movei sucks the big one
. it
' s chockfull of stupid characters delivering inane dialogue fitting snuggly into a preposterous plot
. this is the kind of movie that has one character inserting another character into a car headfirst to the floor only because
.
.
. well
, it
' s supposed tothe be funny
, see
? you see
, that person
then has theri legs swinging in the other person
' s face as they drive
and that distracts the driver
, see
,
and well
, that
' s kinda funny
, noone
? harumph
.
.
. yeah
, well
.
.
. you get tjhe picture
! anyhoo
, freddie prinze jr
.
.
.
. nuff said
. monica potter
, a bad career move
,
but we might forgive you if you keep up the julia roberts bit
. tghe rest of the model girls
.
.
. well
, thanks for being there so i had something tothe look at
,
but please apologize to the entire modeling community as a whole
, for making them all out to be complet imbeciles
!
! so why the three points out of ten
, you may ask
? well
, it
' s simple really
. one point goes to the russion model girl
and that cool accent
( don
' t ask me why
,
but it actually turned me on
)
. one point goes out to all of the model girls for being in the movie
( nice window decoration
.
.
. natch
!
)
.
and one lastest point goes out to the makers ofthe this film
, who spared us any long sorted story
,
and made sure to give us the opportunity of leaving the theatre after only 90 minutes of manufatured garbage
, so that we could run out as fast as we can
, grab the next person that we see walking down the street
and warn them of the devil that isnt
.
.
. freddie prinze jr
.
.
. i mean
, head over heels
. you
' ve been warned
, ogod people
. ps
: didja notice how i didn
' t even mention rear window once infront my entire review
? i didn
' t want tothe taint the memory of the classic flick by having it uttered alongside this thing
,
but
then again
, i just did mention it
,
but i guess it doesn
' t count inspite the ps section
.
.
. or does it
? ooooh
, whatever
.
.
. i have a headache
!
