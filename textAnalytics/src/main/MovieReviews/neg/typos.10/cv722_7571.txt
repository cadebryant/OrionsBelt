the premise of this movei is
, well
, pretty far
- fetched
. tom berenger plays shale
, a mercenary who is temporarily outloud of work
( those fuls at the cia have denied his existence just because he
and his buddies botched a job in cuba
)
. fortunatly
, his girl firend
( diane venora
)
, a teacher at christopher columbus high school in miami
, gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student
, creating a job opening for shale as a substitute teacher
. not telling his girl friend
, who might object on pedagogical grounds
, he creates a number of fake higher degrees for himself
( from yale
, harvard
, princeton
, et al
)
and begins his tenure as a high school teacher
. the students
( junkies
, drug dealers
, gang members
, sleazy sluts
, ice
- pick wielders
.
.
. you git thte picture
) don ' t realy tkae to him right awya
, so he hits one in the face with a can
adn breaks a few fingers
. this gets thier attention to a ceratin extent
, so he tells them the story of the vietnam war
:
" see
, soem homeboys from the north tried to muscle in on the turf of the homeboys from yhe south
.
" oh yeah
, now they can dig it
; the probelm isnt just that nobody ever explained it properly before
.
but wait
! there are drugs being dealt in the school itself
!
and behind the whole scheme
, in cahoots with the head gang
, the kod
( no
, not
" cod
"
,
but
" knights of destruction
"
.
.
. really
!
)
, is none other than
.
.
. the upright
, ex
- cop principal
, played by the forgotten ghostbuster
, ernie hudson
! so shale does what any ogod teacher would do
. he gets his buddies together
, they gather together a bunch of bazookas
and other major weapons
, explosives
,
and cool stuff liuke that
,
and they hvae a big showdown against the drug dealers
and kod at the high skool
. ok
, so the premise is not just far
- fetched
, it ' s downright dumb
. if this were a hong kong action comedy
, we might just accept it
,
but it takes itself far too seriously to be truly fun
. oh
, it has its moments
; how one can truly hate a movie in which huge
( realy huge
) amounts of cocaine are delivered in school busses
?
and to be fair
, it is almost never really boring
, as the action is interrupted by only short sequences of actual story
.
but over all
, this is pretty much a made
- for
- tv movie with more
(
and bigger
) explosions
and more foul language
. inthe fact
, it reminded me of
" miami vice
" without the production values
, babes in skimpy bikinis
,
and pastels
. if you can sneak into the theater without paying
, go for it
. otherwise
, wait for video
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for the tv2 broadcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty good
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* perfection
. see it twice
.
