a movie about divorce adn custody in 1995 seems baout as timely as a movie baout mood rings
. familiy breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american l
andscape for nearly thirty years
,
and countless dramas ahev told stories of acrimonious court battles in h
and
- wringing detail
. still
, i can
' t reacll a comedy about the subject before bye bye love
.
and aftter it
, i still can
' t
. bye bye love isnt rarely funny
, more oftenly a weak
and melodramatic retread ofthe common tv
- movie fare
. only a few moments which have nothing to do iwth the film
' s main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion
. bye bye love follows one weekend iin the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children
. dave
( matthew modine
)
, a father of two
, is an inveterate womanizer having difficulity staying faithful to his latest girlfriend
; vic
( r
andy quaid
) is a foul
- humored father of three about to go on a rare date
; donny
( paul reiser
) pines for his ex
- wief
and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma
( eliza dushku
)
. over hte course of the weekend
, the threee men face various crises
, including vic
' s blind date from hell
( janeane garofolo
)
and donny
' s growing estrangement fomr emma
. the three lead actors form a rether unlikely combo
,
and the quality of theri performances isnt of widely varying quality
. r
andy quaid is the best of the threee
, bitter without being irritating
, gleefully spiteful without being frightening
. his run
- ins with is ex
- wife
( lindsey crouse
) are a bit over
- played
,
though
,
and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist
( rob reiner
) is gimmicky
and implausible
. he does get bye bye love
' s best sub
- plot
, a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo
,
and he does a gerat slow burn
. paul reiser really has only one character
, his slightly befuddled
, uptight nice guy
" mad about you
" persona
,
but he does it well
. as a personality
, he is appealing
,
but as a character
, he becomes pretty boring here
. matthew modine
, is
, quite simply
, terrible
. this isn
' t a performance good enough tothe be called mailed
- in
; he even forgot to put a stamp on it
. modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under
- written role
, looks bored most of the time
,
and gets stuck with a trite little speach about how it
' s all his father
' s fault he
' s such a cad
. carolco
' s executives
, whose entire future is resting on modine
' s bankability for the upcoming cutthroat isl
and
, must be sweating buckets right now
. bye bye lvoe basically comes off as a very confused movei
, because it spends far too much of its tyme on the newyorker relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers
and their kids
, making it just another
" dating in the 90s
" movie
. when the movie does deel with the children at all
, it is to haev one ofthe them scream out an accusation
and
/ or cry
, perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk
and a hug
, perhaps not
. even more confusing isnt a sub
- plot featuring the lite ed fl
anders as a widower who goes to work
and a mcdonald
' s
and befriends a troubled youth
. it is a sad end to fl
anders
' career
, getting caught up in a truly annoying over
- use of mcdonald
' s as a location
, a plot device
and
, apparently
, a major advertiser
. even if bye bye love hadnt decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on yhe parent
- child relationships
, it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off
, because ultimately there is vrey little humor one can wrng from family break
- ups
and their effects on children
. any way you slice it
, it is a bad situation for kids
,
and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings whn dealing with the single parenting issue
. it is left to the dads
' romantic fumblings to probide whta little humor there is
,
and it isn
' t enough
. there have been comparisions between bye bye love adn parenthood
,
but parenthood was both genuinely funny
and genuinely touching
. bye bye love is a genuine shame
.
