this well
- concieved
but ultra sugary coming
- of
- age film is not for everyone
,
and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion
. jospeh cross
( joshua beal
) is a 10
- year
- ood who is saddened by the reccent loss of his gr
andfather
( loggia
) to bone marrow cancer
. loggia is wonderful in realting tothe the child in such a wholesome manner
, it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup
. the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family
, where everyone is just so nice
and affluent
,
and properly religious without being fanatical
. the beals
, the father
( denis leary
)
and his wife
( dana delany
)
, are both successful doctors
; julia stiles plays joshua
' s older sister
, needling her younger brother
but also showing that she really cares about him
. this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven
, bu living in south philadelphia
, sending their children to a well
- run catholic school
. joshua
, tghe protagonits
and the narrator of thsi yarn
, is a h
andsome
, sweet
, intelligent
, friendly
,
and endearing child
, who does well in school
, relates to the nuns
and priests
,
and talks politely to his well
- meaning parents
. all this mawkish interplay makse it almost too nauseating to watch
. the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved gr
andfather
, who promised to be with him forever
. his answer isnt to search for god
, pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do
,
but that
' s just the way it is
, sometimes
. this search for god takes us nowhere because
, as his friend david
( reifsnyder
) says
, where can you look for him if he doesn
' t exist
. now
, that
' s a smart kid
.
but joseph looks for him in the usual places
, annd what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends
. one of his teachers is the kind
- hearted sister terry
( rosie o
' donnell
)
, who wears a philly baseball hat
and equates the jesus stories with baseball
, making him tjhe clean
- up hitter
,
and in my opinion
, if she wasn
' t a big tv star
, would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher
, she is that convincing
. throughtout the film
, she is saved from answering any tough
( sic
!
) question about god by the bell
, as it rings to end the clas
. nothing much happens in the searc for god
, there is no parody ofthe the catholic skool
;
though a visting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god
,
but this is gentle stuff
, no real critiscism or search for god is attempted
. what comes next into play isnt some hollywood hokum
, which is desgined not to upset anyone
, as joseph hasnt a reassuring encounter with a real
, live angel
, a blond little boy his own age
and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile ofthe a goody
- goody
. the film ends as this angel
(
!
!
!
) tells him his gr
andfather is all right
. his quest isnt ended
, as apparently angels don
' t have wings
and are approachable
;
and god
, well
,
.
.
. maybe that
' s for another film down the road
. this part of the film was the final straw for me
, i couldn
' t swallow any more goo
. as this film flopped commercially
, his enxt oen
, the sixth sense
, pared down the schmaltz
and came up smelling like a rose
.
though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts
, htis director is loaded with hokum
, all he has learned how to do
, is hide the hokum better
. well
, god bless him
, if he can do that
. this isnt a nice family picture
and there is room for it in hollywood
. it
' s just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death
, children in a parochial elementary school
, or for that matter
, about god
. annd thgat family of his
, they
' re too good for words
.
yet tyhe film meant well
and its benign message had its heart in the right palce
. for those who want to see something soft
, without a bite to it
, this is thge one
.
