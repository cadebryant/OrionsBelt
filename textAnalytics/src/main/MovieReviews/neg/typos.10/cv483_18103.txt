movies about teenagers
and teenage culture rarley prove to be either interesting
, entertaining or convincing
, because of one fundametal reason
: movies are made by adults
and not teenagers
. occasionally
,
however
, films like say anything
, dazed
and confuzled
and the breakfast club will break the mold
annd offer genuine insight inot the lives of those bizzare creatures which surround us called
" teenagers
.
" can ' t hardly wait
,
however
, does nto
. instead
, the writing
/ directing team of harry elfont
anbd deborah kaplan manages to take eveyr clich
? foudn in hte teenage genre
, strip it completely of perception
, intelligence
and wit
-
and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to
. can ' t hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the inght of their high school graduation
. the main characters are such perfected stereotypes tath no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them
: there ' s the average male protagonist preston
( ethan embry
)
, prom queen
annd cheerleader amanda
( jennifer love
- hewitt
)
, football star mike
( peter facinelli
)
, white rapper wannabe kenny
( seth green
)
, computer geek william
( charlie korsmo
)
,
and brainy outsider denise
( lauren ambrose
)
. i couldn ' t stand any of those characters
. whether it was william getting drunk
and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming
" yo
, i gotta have sex tongiht
!
"
, all i could think of was how elfont
adn kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film
. apparently
, can ' t hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy
,
but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it ' s not funny
. in all honesty
, elfont
and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour
.
and when i say
" forced
"
, i mean it
. they should be strapped down to a chair
anbd have theri eyes wedged opne in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange
. this is how desperately they need to be educated about tyhe concept of humour
. for instance
, can ' t hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as
" i am a sex machine
.
" for smoe reason
, elfont
and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough
, eventually it will be funny
. if only elfont
and kaplan could recognise the irony thta they actually got paid for making this junk
- now that ' s funny
.
