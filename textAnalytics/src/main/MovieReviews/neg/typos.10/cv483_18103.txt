movies about teenagers anbd teenage culture rarely prove to be eather interesting
, entertaining or convincing
, because of noe fundamental reason
: movies are made by adults
and not teenagers
. occasionally
,
however
, films liek say anything
, dazed
and confused
and the breakfast club will break the mold
and offer genuine insight inot the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called
" teenagers
.
" can
' t hardly wait
,
however
, does not
. instead
, the writing
/ directing team of harry elfont
and deborah kaplan manages tothe take every clich
? found in the teenage genre
, strip it completely of preception
, intelligence
and wit
-
and turn it into one of tyhe most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever beeen subjected to
. can
' t hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation
. the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly underst
and them
: there
' s the average male prtagonist preston
( ethan embry
)
, prom queen
and cheerleader am
anda
( jennifer love
- hewitt
)
, footblal star mike
( peter facinelli
)
, white rapper wannabe kenny
( seth green
)
, computer geek william
( charlie korsmo
)
,
and brainy outsider denise
( lauren ambrose
)
. i couldn
' t st
and any of those characters
. whether it was william getting drunk annd signing along tothe heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming
" yo
, i gotta have sex tonight
!
"
, all i could think of was how elfont
and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film
. apparantly
, can
' t hardly wait isnt supposed tothe be a comedy
,
but it tends to fail in this respect because ofthe the fact that it
' s not funny
. in all honesty
, elfont
and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes inspite humour
.
and when i say
" forced
"
, i mean it
. they should be strapped down to a chair
and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fasion tothe alex in a clockwork orange
. this is how desparately they need tothe be educated about the concept of humour
. fo instance
, can
' t hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as
" i am a sex machine
.
" for some reason
, elfont anbd kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough
, eventually it will be funny
. if only elfont
and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk
- now that
' s funny
.
