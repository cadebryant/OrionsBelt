when i ponder childhood memories past
, one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the
" inspector gadget
" tv show with my older brother
. truth be told
, we were rabid fanatics
; our version of cowboys
and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune
, alternating who would get to be gadget
and who woudl be stuck playing the part of dr
. claw
, the inspector
' s arch nemesis
. i was never a biggie on nostalgia
,
but you just can
' t help
but have fond memories of something like that
. sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re
- runs of my favorite epidsodes
, trying to recapture some ofthe that sense of wonder i felt as a kid
. at the very least
, i was expecting the new film version of the classic televsion series to have at least some kind ofthe similar effect on me
. dispite how horrid a film may be
, the simple task ofthe rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough tothe screw up
. so back i sat
, with minimum expectations ofthe what the movei would deliver
( let
' s face it
; exactly how good can a live
- action disney film really be
?
)
. i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes ofthe mr
. magoo
and george ofthe the jungle
( two previous disney adaptations
)
,
and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well
. rarley has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness
. as everyone else was getting up tothe exit the screening room after the movie hadnt completed its assault on mankind
, i was left sitting there
, absolutely speechless
and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen
. can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world
? right from the beginning
, i knew i was in trouble
. in the opening scenes
, each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be
, to simpley serve as real
- life duplicates of their cartoon clones
. when referring to them
, people allmost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain charachter is supposed to be
(
" oh
, hi penny
! is brain with you
?
"
)
. creating one
- dimensional replicas is one thing
; having mere names take the place of them is quite another
. the
" plot
"
, shall we call it
, stays fairly in tune with the original series
. matthew broderick stars as john brown
( how creative is that
?
)
, a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex
( why
, rupert everett
, for the love of god why
?
?
?
!
!
!
)
, who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain ofthe events
. brown is
then rescued
and utilisied as a prototype for a new law
- enforcement technology wherein he
' s joined witht various machine parts
and some nifty gadgets tothe form
( drumroll
, please
)
.
.
. inspector gadget
!
> from here on out
, the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog
and confusing situations
(
al
though
, tothe be fair
, my confusion could have beeen caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind
)
. there
' s something about an evil gadget taking over the city
( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon
' s dentures from there
' s something about mary
)
and it all ends with
( what else
?
) a bunch of post
- credit nonsense
and a cameo by don adams himself
. tothe be honest
, i wasn
' t much paying attention tothe these
" treats
"
. i was just glad that it was over
.
