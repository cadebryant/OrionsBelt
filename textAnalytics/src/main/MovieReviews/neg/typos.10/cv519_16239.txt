terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones
' world war ii novel
. unfortunately
, he burried it within an overlong
and overreaching 3
- hour long pseudo
- epic
. this is a shame because thte film features an outst
anding performance by nick nolte
. the best scene is when nick nolte
' s character
, lt
. col
. tall
, is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt
. staros
( elias koteas
) to execute an order
. nolte
' s reaction
and transformation may be the best work of his career
. had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances ofthe nolte annd koteas as well as those by sean penn
, woody harrelson
,
and john cusack
, he could have made a truly great film
. instead
, malick saddled the film with plodding pacing
, unnecessary flashbacks
,
and a voice
- over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the stoy
. tyhe narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry
. with a lot of editing
, the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film
. hopefully
, thge dvd version of this film will feature options tothe suppress the narration
,
and perhaps will even provide for an alternate
, shorter verzion of the film
. i give this film
.
