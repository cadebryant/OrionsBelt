bob the happy bastard
' s quickie review
: the odd cuple ii grumpy old men
, it ain
' t
. hell
, my fellow americans
, it ain
' t
. walter matthau anbd jack lemmon team up again for an even more worn out vehichle thna any of thier films over the past few years
. odd couple ii feels terribly generic
, where in the first movie
, made thirty oney years ago
, fiels like a wonderful tale
. that
' s liek repackaging campbell
' s soup in a generic fodo can
, really
. how writer neil simon could
' ve made such a horrible mistake in screen writing is beyond me
. throughout the movie
, i really didn
' t laugh once
. honestly
. i mean
, there were dumb situations
, yeah
, like the cropduster who let theese old geezers have it without any notice
,
but they just really didn
' t seem funny to me
. annd tath car rolling off the cliff
? teh only way i owudl
' ve seen humor in that is if they were still in it
.
and the ending gets all super
- mushy
, too
. in thte final twenty minutes or so
, lemmon meets a girl he thinks is the one
,
then loses her
; matthau talks tothe his son
( a wasted jonathan silverman
) baout his amrriage to lemmon
' s duaghter
;
and
, of course
, lemmon
and matthau have another roomie situation on their h
ands
. ooh
, i really gave a lot away there
, i
' m sure
. consider it a hospitable gester
, you won
' t waste your time renting this muck
.
