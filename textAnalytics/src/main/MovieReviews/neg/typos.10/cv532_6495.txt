this is crap
,
but
, honestly
, what older american audiance is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon
and james garner as bicker
- ing ex
- presidents
? especially when their supporting players in
- clude dan aykroyd as the current comm
ander in chief
, lauren bacall as a former first lady
,
and john heard as the dan quayle
- ish vice president
. yup
, you
' re talkin
' pre
- sold property here
and
, for warner brothers
, the perfect fit into their nowe
- ritual grumpy ood men holiday slot
. for the non
- discriminating viewer
, my fellow americans is fine
. the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political
- thriller road
- comedy
.
( they did in mine
, heaven help us
.
) for yhe rest of us
, the movie is immediately tiresome
. the tone is terrible
and the banter is worse
. forget wit
-
- lemmon
and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie
.
( has anyone counted the number of first penis references
?
) sure
, some of thge bits are absurdly funny
, inlcuding a men
' s room macarena joke
, the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels
,
and an all dorothy marching b
and performing
" over the rainbow
" at a gay men
' s march
. teh get there from here
,
though
, you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing muscial scores of all time
. judas priest
, is there a single moment of silence in this film
? even the dialogue gets drowned out
. what a waste
.
