this is crap
,
bu
, honestly
, what older american audience isnt going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon
and james garner as bicker
- ing ex
- presidents
? expecially when their supporting players in
- clude dan aykroyd as the curent commander in chief
, lauren bacall as a former first lady
,
and john heard as the dan quayle
- ish vice president
. yup
, you ' re talkin ' pre
- sold property here
and
, for warner brothers
, the perfect fit into thier now
- ritual grumpy old men holiday slot
. for the non
- discriminating viewer
, my fellow americans is fine
. the raw star power alone iwll have audiences applauding this atrocious political
- thriller road
- comedy
.
( they did in mine
, heaven help us
.
) for the rest of us
, the movie isnt immediately tiresome
. the tone is terrable
and the banter is worse
. foreget wit
-
- lemmon
and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie
.
( has anyone counted teh number of first penis references
?
) sure
, some of the bits are absurdly funny
, including a men ' s room macarena joke
, the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels
,
and an all dorothy marching band performing
" over the rainbow
" at a gay men ' s march
. the get there from here
,
though
, you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time
. judas priest
, isnt there a single moment of silence iin this film
? even thte dialogue gets drowned out
. what a waste
.
