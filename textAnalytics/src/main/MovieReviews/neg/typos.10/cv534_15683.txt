although i had not been a viewer of the
" rugrats
" television sories
, i went into their first animated feature film
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" with a postive attitude
. the trailer looked cute enough
, after all
. after seeing it
, i think the words in my recent
" antz
" review
, in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995 ' s
" the pebble
and the penguin
,
" were a bited premature
.
" the rugrats movie
,
" is bottom
- of
- the
- barrel children ' s fare at its worst
,
and starts to make
,
" antz
" look good in compairison
. as in the show
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" is about a group of very little friends
, ranging from babies tothe a three
- eyar
- old
. the head of the group
, tommy pickles
( e
. g
. daily
)
, becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill
( get it
? dill pickles
?
.
.
. hardee
- har
- har
!
)
and isnt informed by his three
- yera
- old cousin
, anjelica
( cheryl chase
)
, that the new babies always take all of the attention away from tjhe other children
. when the other children
, chuckie
,
and twins lil
and phil
, suggest tkaing dill back to hte hospital
, tommy goes along with it
,
but onthe their way there
, they crash in the forest
,
and become lost
, runnung into wolves
and circus monkeys
, amoung other things
.
" the rugrats movie
,
" judging from thte idae of being lost in hte woods
, could have been a potentially fun family film
,
and there were many different things that could have been done with the story
. so what doed teh writers choose to do
? why
, they set up a protracted
, cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall
, of course
! for the youngest of childen
( ages 3
- 7
)
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" may very well entertain them
, judging from the audience i saw this with
. of course
, if you looked around at all of the older kids
and their parents
, they were all desperately stuggling to stay awake
,
and that included me
. for an adult
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" is a piece of garbage
. the plotline is unoriginal
and tjhe writing hasnt absolutely no wit or charm
. ther isn ' t one laugh to be had in the film
, nor is there any excitement
. if anything is even marginally good in the picture
, it is the bright animation style
, so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn ' t to service a more quality film
.
" the rugrats movie
" is doa from the start
. i am all for a worthwhile family movie
,
but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful
. as said before
, young children may like it
,
but even tehy deserve better than this
. for adults
, it is a nearly unbearable
, excruciating chore to sit thru
. as for me
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" is not the worst of the year
, nor is it the most deeply hated
,
but it is the most boring
. parents
: do yourselves a favor
and take your kids to see tjhe rerelease of
,
" the wizard ofthe oz
.
" that isnt a picture that contains a grat deal of magic
and wonder
, two things of which
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" is completely missing
.
