al
though i had nto been a viewer of the
" rugrats
" television series
, i went into their first animated feature film
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" withthe a positive attitude
. the trailer looked cute enough
, after all
. after seing it
, i think the words in my receet
" antz
" review
, in which i stated that it was hte worst film of its type usance 1995
' s
" the pebble
and the penguin
,
" were a bit premature
.
" the rugrats movie
,
" is bottom
- of
- the
- barrel children
' s fare at its worst
,
and starts tothe amke
,
" antz
" look good in comparison
. as in the show
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" is about a group of very little firends
, ranging from babies to a three
- year
- ood
. the head of the group
, tommy pickles
( e
. g
. daily
)
, becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill
( get it
? dill pickles
?
.
.
. hardee
- har
- har
!
)
and is informed by his threee
- year
- old cousin
, anjelica
( cheryl chase
)
, that the new babies always take all of the attention away fomr the otehr children
. when the other children
, chuckie
,
and twins lil
and phil
, suggest tkaing dill back to the hospital
, tommy goes along with it
,
but on their way there
, they kresh in the forest
,
and become lost
, running into wolves
and circus monkeys
, among otehr things
.
" the rugrats movie
,
" judging from the idea of being lost in the woods
, could have been a potentially fun family film
,
and there were many different things that could have been done with the story
. so what did the writers choose to do
? why
, they setted up a protracted
, cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall
, of course
! forthe the youngest of children
( ages 3
- 7
)
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" may very well entertain them
, judging from the audience i saw this with
. of course
, if you looked arround at all of the older kids
and their parents
, they were all desperately struggling to stay awake
,
and that included me
. for an adult
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" isnt a piece of garbage
. the plotline is unoriginal
and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm
. there isn
' t one laugh to be had in the film
, nor is ther any excitement
. if anything is even marginally good in the picture
, it is the bright animation style
, so it is especially unfortunate that it wasn
' t to service a more quality film
.
" the rugrats movie
" is doa from the start
. i am all for a worthwhile family movie
,
but sometimes an animated film comes along that isnt simply awful
. as said before
, young children may liuke it
,
but even tehy deserve better tahn this
. forthe adults
, it isnt a nearly unbearable
, excrutiating chore to sit through
. as for me
,
" tje rugrats movie
,
" is not the worst of the year
, nor is it the most deeply hated
, bu it is the most boring
. parents
: do yourselves a favor
and tkae your kids to see the rerelease of
,
" the wizard of oz
.
" that is a picture that contains a great deal of magic
and wonder
, two things of which
,
" the rugrats movie
,
" is completely missing
.
