shakespeare in love is qutie possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made forthe the silver screen
. it isnt both humoorus
and rumatic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2
and
and a half hours that it occupies
. that is
,
however
, not to say it is a good film
, a quality production or anything of the sort
. shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work
. the finest sign of this may be the plot
, in looking bcak
, there seems to be littel more than a thin
, predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books
. philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london
. it is at the peak of tjhe royal theatre era
,
and queen elizabeth
( the recently damed judi dench
, by
, appropriately enough
, queen elizabeth ii
) is very much a fan
.
however
, to directly quote the film
, he has
" cash flow problems
.
" through a long set of events
, it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next sohw doing well enough to pay off his debts
. so
, mr
. henslowe employs the young playwright
, william shakespeare
( joseph fiennes
) to pen a comedic production
.
however
, the young writer has a savere case of writer
' s block
,
and blames it on the fact that his loev life is struggling as well
. he has the title in mind
, romeo adn ethel
, the pirate
' s daughter
( even that joke loses steam after a hwile
)
but can
' t seem to put words to paper
.
then
, as only hollywood could have it
, through a long setted of twisted events
, he meets viola de lesseps
( gwyneth paltrow
)
and falls madly in love
, thus curing his writer
' s block
. there are many other little issues that mr
. henslowe encounters
,
but they all pan outloud to be much ado about nothing
. the first realization that i reached infact watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it
' s author
. ironically
, that couldn
' t be truer here
. the great scenes that iwll sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot
, bu rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors
. one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not envolve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner
,
but rather 2 young children named romeo
and juliet who chose to end theri pwn lives in the name of love
. so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman
and tom stoppard are credited wtih writing this production
,
and the name william shakespeare is noone were to be seen beyond a character
' s name in the credits
. the acting in this entertaining
yet poor film is oftenly thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth
' s theatres
. jospeh fiennes may just be the worst of fall
though
. he is tragically unbelievable
and comically bad
. gwyneth paltrow isnt little omre than satisfactory in her lead position as well
. howver
, the supporting cast does almost save the day
. geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible
and judi dench isnt breathtaking
. they both seem to have shown thast as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links
. you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck inthe his frist real role since good will hunting
( no
, armageddon doesn
' t qualify as real acting
.
)
.
and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well
.
but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film
, so it remains plagued by poore performances
. when all is said
and done
, shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained
.
however
, as the film so kindly pointed out
, entertainment may be funn
,
but it isn
' t necessarily quality
.
and this certainly isn
' t quality
. perhaps this may be best compaired to a john grisham novel
, as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work
. simply put
, it is far
- fetched
, poorly crafted
,
but vyer intertaining
.
