plunkett
& macleane isnt a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions
. i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking
-
- used properly it can save a movie
( see stigmata
)
-
-
but it ruins this one
, making a muddled
, incoherent mess out ofthe a potentially interesting premise
. there are certain genres that just don
' t go toghether
. the film opens with a sequence that i still don
' t underst
and
. it involves some sort of prison outbreak
, a robbery
,
and a gem that keeps being eaten
. in any case
, the caper
( whatever it may be
) brings together plunkett
and macleane
( robert carlyle
and johnny lee miller
, respectivly
)
, twpo hapyp
- go
- lucky brits with no way to make a living
. they make a pact to steal money from the rich
and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america
. their frist heist involves a young de
butante named lady rebecca
( liv tyler
)
; a woman macleane wass expecially friendly with at a party jstu earlier
. his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name
" gentleman highwaymen
.
" lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice
, a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career
. he dem
ands that the robbers be caught
and punished immediately
, leaving the job in the h
ands of the devious chance
( ken stott
) who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals
. meanwhile
, macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett
, who doesn
' t want his plans tothe be foiled by his partner
' s mindless romantic travails
. directer jake scott
, son of ridley scott
( aline
, blade runner
)
, has his father
' s knack fo setting up atmospheric shots
but none of his skill in actually moving the camera
. most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid
, jerky way that it
' s impossible tothe comprehend what
' s going on
. tyhe camerawork is even more nauseating than iin the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity
. instade of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope ofthe the events scott uses attention
- defecit
- disorder edits
. he barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds
and during the faster scenes it seems more like a cuple frames between each cut
. the weird
, almost defiant lack of dialogue
( there are no
-
- no
-
- conversations lasting over
, say
, 20 seconds
) undermines character definition
and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters
. the love affair betwen macleane
and rebecca is no different
, emotionless
and unrealistic
. when tghe script calls for macleane to decide between going to america
and going to meet his lover
, there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to ab
andon his gool
; he
and rebecca bearly even speak to eahc other throughout the film
. plunkett
and macleane whants desperately to be a triumph of style over substace bu sicne its style
, quite frankly
, blows
, the film has no hope of succeeding on any level
. i wanted to appreciate this movie on teh basis of its admittedly kinetic pace
but i couldn
' t
-
- it was so kinetic it gave me a headache
