everyone knows that ood rule
,
' never work with children
and animals
.
' inspite this latest horror flick mimic case
, it
' s
' never work with children
and genetically enhanced killer animals
' instead
, as mimic features both ofthe theese
and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience
. the film begins in newyorker york
, where we see children dying from a mysterious disease
, which is being carried by cockroaches
. dr
. susan tyler
( sorvino
) creates a genetically enhanced bug
( the
' judas
' breed
)
,
however
, which is designed to kill all cockroaches
. the bug does it
' s job
, the cockroaches all die
, adn the terror is gone
.
' three years later
' appears on the screen
,
and we discover that the judas breed is back
, bigger than ever
,
and ready to kill
. the spin on this bug
,
however
, is that it can mimic it
' s predator
,
and in this case
.
.
.
. it
' s humans
. that shoud teach us for squishing all those bugs
. what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere
, tons ofthe gory deaths
and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued
, almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace
. perhaps the movie was trying to be
thought provoking
,
and trying to avoid the
' predator
' type movie it could easily have become
. if it is
, hten the director
and writers have made the wrong move
, because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest
. the director
, who bought us cronos
, a far superior film
, directs the film inspite a calm
,
and frankly dull movie
. there are few exciting sequences
, instade just a lot of people talking
. if the dialogue was intelligent
,
then it would be all right
,
but it
' s sadly babbling nonsense
. in fact
, the script is embarrsingly weak
,
and the characterizations not much better
. sorvino
and company are as 2d as characters come
, with the script not bothering to develop them
. there is some action infront this film
,
but it
' s directed inwhich such an annoying way
, it
' s jstu infuriating to watch
. the camera cuts all over the place
, disoreitating the audience
,
and instead of involving the audience in the action
, it mearly alienates them
. the peformances are o
. k
, if slightly below average
. sorvino is o
. k
,
al
though she
' s not very ogod at conveying terror
, or anything emotion really
. the supporting cast are all sterotypes
, with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth
, a geeky scientist with spectacles
,
and what could be the most stereotypical mexican
' old timer
' ever
. their reasonable good fun
,
however
. mimic
,
then
, may fail with it
' s stoy
, pacing
and characters
,
but thte film does look ogod
. liuke dark city
, mimic is a defintie case of style of content
. it may be a bit too gloomy for it
' s own good
,
but the sets look nice
,
and parts of the film are directed well
.
but looks aren
' t good anough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre
, somwhere where it shouldn
' t really belong
. a good opprotunity
,
then
, wasted
. a shame
. overall rating
