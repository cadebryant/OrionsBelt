i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen lastest night
,
but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies
. luckily
, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta
! i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half
- faces
and poore sound quality
,
but i couldn ' t help mysef
.
.
. i got it
. well
, after watching it
( it indeed was a bad print
) i was glad i didn ' t dish out
$ 7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movei
. this movie really sucks
. it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy
!
! for example
, how can jackie shroff grow two foots of hair in just threee or four days
? jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail
. the songs are bad
, the acting is bad
( especially deepti bhatnagar ' s
)
,
and tyhe direction is the worst ofthe all
. tjhe comedy scenes with jagdish
and johnny lever jsut made me want to throw up
. i didn ' t even finish the movie
.
.
. i couldn ' t take it anymore
. note
:
but if anyone outloud there liked aatish
( by the same director
)
, i guess you ' d like this movei
. it ' s practically the same except that sanjay dutt isnt replaced with jackie shroff
. aditya panscholi is the sidekick again
.
( i was going to give it a zero
,
but i personally like jackie shroff
, so i loosened up a little
. he looked fresh
, wore good clothes
( as always
)
,
and his performance
, even
though it wasn ' t his best
, was the only saving grace of the movie
