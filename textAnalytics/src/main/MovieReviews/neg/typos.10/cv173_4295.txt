i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night
,
but before that i stoped into my video store to rent soem movies
. luckily
, my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta
! i knew it was going to be a bad print whith only half
- faces
and poor sound quality
,
but i couldn
' t help myself
.
.
. i got it
. well
, after watching it
( it indeed wass a bad print
) i was glad i didn
' t dish out
$ 7 to waste threee hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie
. this movie really sucks
. it had so many inconsistencies it ws driving me crazy
!
! for exmaple
, how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days
? jackie shroff looked really stupid withthe his steven seagal ponytail
. the songs are bad
, the acting is bad
( especially deepti bhatnagar
' s
)
, adn the direction is the worst of all
. hte comedy scenes with jagdish
and johnny lever jstu made me want to throw up
. i didn
' t even finish the movie
.
.
. i couldn
' t take it anymore
. note
: bu if anyone out there liked aatish
( by the same director
)
, i guess you
' d like this movie
. it
' s practically thte same except thta sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff
. aditya panscholi is tje sidekick again
.
( i was going to give it a zero
,
but i personally like jackie shroff
, so i loosened up a little
. he looked fresh
, wore good clothes
( as always
)
,
and his performance
, even
though it wasn
' t his best
, was the only saving grace of the movie
)
