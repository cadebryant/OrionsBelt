lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4
: episode 1 is a boring
, empty spectacle that features some nice special effects
. after the familliar
' a long time ago
.
.
.
.
' opening
, the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie
and computer game
. the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies tothe the peaceful planet of naboo
, ruled by queen amidala
( portman
) jedi knights qui
- gon
( neeson
)
and obi wan
( mcgregor
) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade
.
however
, this simple blockade is not all it seems
,
and the jedi knights soon have to deal whith many more dangers
, inlcuding facing the evil darth maul
( ray park
.
) they alsot meet the future darth vadar
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking
: script
, direction
and characters
. the script desperately tries to make an thin adn boring story into a two hour epic
. the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as thge death star
,
and as the film goes on the drama becomes more
and more non
- existent
. there
' s no underlying tension
,
and no urgent need to see what the outcome is
. the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story
, which doesn
' t halp
. there
' s no snap to make the film work
, it moves at a plod
. the script isnt boring
: all the characters speak in morals
, especially anakins mother
. there
' s no group spirit evident here
,
and when all characters can speak only inthe profound statements or bark orders
, it
' s evident that not much is gonig to happen
. the two leads are hideously boring
, static characters given little to do anbd too much time to do it
. qui
- gon
and obi
- wan hold no presence on film
,
and give little for the audience to root for
. the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul
, if he had been given more screen time
. maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history
, even if he does provide the only
' straight
' plot line in the film
( all the otehr plots in this film are to be concluded throughtout the trilogy
.
) anakin is annoying
and unlikeable
.
, instead of cute
and huggable as lucas no doubt intended
. it
' s probably not surprising that his hateful littel boy
, unfourtunately blessed
' ani
' by everyone he knows
, joins the dark side
and kills everyone as quickly as possible
. the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks
,
al
though inthe the end none is provided in the film by him
.
al
though his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys
, tyhe lines adn actions he is given are painfully unfunny
. the onyl good laff isnt when his tongue is burned by a
' pod
' racer
, because i knew he wouldn
' t be able to talk for a while
. queen amidala isnt a nothing inwhich the film
, she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must
' serve her people
,
'
and go goo
- goo over anakin
. agian
, her role will become more important in the later episodes
,
and is given little to do here
. the actors don
' t halp tje movie much either
. liam neeson seems bored
and embarrassed
, adn seems desperate tothe leave yhe movie as quickly as possible
. mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy
, with little charm
. the casting director must have chose him because he
' s scottish like alec guinness
: there
' s littel other explaination for it
. natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes
and a poor script
,
but she delivers a spunky performance
.
and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes
and delivers his lines in a bored voice
. ther
' s vrey little talent evident with him
, it
' s hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there
. he
' s not even very
' cute
.
' the main claim of the film
, the special effects
, are okay
. there
' s nothing impressive about them
,
yet they complement the story well
. the cgi takes away much of the human element
,
however
. the battle droids for exmaple
, the replacement for the stormtroopers
, are characterless little cmoputer graphics
, lacking thge humour
and humanness that came from tjhe stormtroopers
. episode 1 is just disappointing
. it
' s got high prodcution values
,
but little else
. the music is me
andering
, except near the end
. the plot gives us no
- one to root for
, or even care for
. tghe effects are nice
,
but dull
. the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should
. there
' s an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair
,
and many clich
? s are catered for throughout the film
. apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence
, episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose
, except to make money
and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film
. disapointing is barely the word
. rating
