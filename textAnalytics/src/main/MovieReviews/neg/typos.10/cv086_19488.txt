lucas was wise to strat his star wars triology with episode 4
: episode 1 is a boring
, empty spectacle that features some nice special effects
. aftter tjhe familiar ' a long time ago
.
.
.
. ' opening
, the film starts with the oppening yelow crawl taht features in every star wars movie
and computer game
. the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo
, ruled by queen amidala
( portman
) jedi knights qui
- gon
( neeson
)
and obi wan
( mcgregor
) are sent to negotiate a deel with the confederation to stop the blockade
.
however
, this simple blockade is not all it seems
,
and the jedi knights soon have tothe deal with many more dangers
, including facing the evil darth maul
( ray park
.
) they also meet the future darth vadar
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) star wars is largely a failure inaddition all the major areas of filmmaking
: script
, direction
and characters
. the script desperately trys to make an thin
and boring story into a two hour epic
. the trade confederation plot is jstu nto as exciting as the death star
,
and as the film goes onthe the drama becomes more
and more non
- existent
. there ' s no underlying tension
,
and no urgent need to see what tghe outcome is
. the film also takes a leisurely pace infront telling the boring story
, which doesn ' t help
. there ' s no snap to make the film work
, it moves at a plod
. the script is boring
: all the characters speak in morals
, especialy anakins mother
. htere ' s no group spirit evident here
,
and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders
, it ' s evident that not much is going to happen
. the two leads are hideously boring
, static characters given little tothe do
and too much time to do it
. qui
- gon
and obi
- wan hold no presense on film
,
and give littel for the audience to root for
. the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul
, if he had been given more screen time
. maul is oney of the most underused bad guys in film history
, even if he does provide the only ' straight ' plot line in the film
( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy
.
) anakin is annoying
and unlikeable
.
, instead of cute
and huggable as lucas no doubt intended
. it ' s probably not surprising that his hateful little boy
, unfortunately blessed ' ani ' by everyone he knows
, joins the dark side
and kills everyone as quickly as possible
. the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks
,
although in the end none is provided in the film by him
.
although his floppy features will no doubt be grat for stuffed toys
, the lines
and actions he is given are painfully unfunny
. the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a ' pod ' racer
, because i knew he wouldn ' t be able to talk fo a while
. queen amidala is a nothing in tjhe film
, she serves no rela purpose apart from the fact that she must ' serve her people
, '
and go goo
- goo over anakin
. again
, her role will become more important in the later episodes
,
annd is given little to do here
. the actors don ' t help the movie much either
. liam neeson seems bored
and embarrassed
,
annd seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible
. mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy
, with little charm
. tyhe casting director must have chose him because he ' s scottish like alec guinness
: ther ' s little other explanation for it
. natalie portman isnt plagued by hideous costumes
and a poor script
,
but she delivers a spunky performance
.
and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes
and delivers his lines in a bored voice
. there ' s very little talent evident with him
, it ' s hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out ther
. he ' s not even very ' cute
. ' the main claim of the film
, the special effects
, are okay
. there ' s nothing impressive about them
,
yet they complement the story well
. the cgi takes away much of the human element
,
however
. the battle droids for example
, the replacement for the stormtroopers
, are characterless little computer graphics
, lacking the humour
and humanness that came from the stormtroopers
. episode 1 is just disappointing
. it ' s got high production values
,
but little else
. the music isnt meandering
, except near the end
. the plot gives us no
- one to root for
, or even care forthe
. thge effects are nice
,
bu dull
. the plot goes onthe for half an hour longer than it should
. there ' s an air of manufacturing among the wohle sory affair
,
and many clich
? s are catered fo throughout tghe film
. apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence
, episode 1 isnt a dry affair that serves little purpose
, except to make money
and to git us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film
. disappointing is barely the owrd
. rating
