sometimes i wonder jstu what the censors are thinking
. take this film
,
" naked killer
"
, among it ' s ingredients are heavy doses of violence
, rape sequences
, straight
adn lesbian sex scenes
and what our system calls
" coarse language
"
.
but what dont thsoe intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended
? one word
- penis
. that ' s it
. in spite of everything else inwhich the movie the one thing that the censors deside is too much is
" penis
.
"
. it really restores you ' re faith in the system
, huh
? anyway
, that ' s just a side point
. wehn naked killer ws released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne
, it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip
, cool
, contraversial thriller
. what they forgot to mention was that it isn ' t vyer good
. the plot involves male cop tinam
( simon yam
)
, investigating a series of brutal murders
. while getting a haircut he meets
and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty
( chingmy yau
)
, who
, after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father
, falls in with proffesional killer sister cindy
( svenwara madoka
)
. realising kitty hasnt potential
, cindy decides to train kitty in severeal unusual
and ridiculous ways
and gives her a new identity
.
however in the course of his investigation tinam
( who believed kitty had dissapeared
)
, runs into her again
,
but isn ' t quite sure if it ' s her
. to complicate matters the actual serial killlers
, princess
and baby
, who a former students of cindy
,
and ahev been told to kill their old master
and her newyorker student
. from
then the action ensues
.
.
. all in all
, this is not a well done movie
. the script is awful
, tghe direction all over the place
, the editting is jerky
and confusing
anbd the subtitling is surprisingly poor
.
however the are a fewd stand alone pieces that do entertain
. the shoot out in the car park is almost woo
- like in adrenaline
. yhe fight scenes are energetic
and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different
. let me put this way
, if you like action
- get something else
, if you like strong women in movies
- get something else
, if you have do decide between this
and
" black cat
" for your hong kong female action
- don ' t get either
. even forthe curiocity value it just isn ' t worth it
. let ' s face it
- if ever the was a movie that became popular on it ' s subject alone
, this is it
.
