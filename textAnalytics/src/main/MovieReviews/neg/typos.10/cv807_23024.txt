and i
thought
" stigmata
" would be the worst religiously
- orientated thriller released this year
. turns out i was wrong
, because while
" stigmata
" was merely boring
and self
- important
,
" end of days
" is completely inept on all fronts
. it
' s a silly
, incomprehensible
, endlessly stupid mess
. for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best
, it
' s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up
. for the first time in recent memory
, an arnold action movie
(
and
" batman
& robin
" doesn
' t count
) is noone fun at all
.
" end of days
" is a major stinker
. the movie opens in vatican city
, 1979
. some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy
, which says that a girl will be born on thta night that satan will ahve targeted for impregnation
. if he impregnates her between 11
and midnight on december 31
, 1999
, the world will be destroyed
. the pope orders protection ofthe tihs girl
,
though some priests believe she ought to be killed
. in new york
, that very night
, a girl is born tothe fulfill tjhe prophecy
. twenty years later
, we meet jericho cane
( schwarzenegger
)
, a suicidal ex
- cop with a drinking problem
. now working as a security guard for hire
, he is protecting a local businessman
( gabriel byrne
)
, who is actually possessed by the devil
. an assassintation attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after
, christine york
( robin tunney
)
. recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine
( including ownership of the same music box
, apparently
)
, jericho swears to protect her against the devil
and the faction of priests looking to kill her
. there are so many problems with this film it
' s hard tothe know where to begin
,
but how about starting with the concept
? casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin wih
. schwarzenegger is a persona
, not an actor
, so putting him iin a role thast contradicts his usual strong personality isnt a bad idea
. arnold hasnt neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability tothe pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions
. in other words
, trying to give him dimension was a mistake
. harrison ford
, mel gibson
, or even bruce willis could have played this role
( they
' ve all played noble
and flawed heroes
)
,
but not schwarzenegger
. there are several scenes that attemp to establish jericho
' s carachter
; one has him contemplating suicide
, anohter crying over the loss of his wife
and daughter
,
and even one inwhich which the devil tries tothe tempt him into revealing christine
' s location by offering him his ood life back
. none of these scenes really work
, because arnie isn
' t up to the task
. the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong
, confident character
( like the terminator
, for example
)
, the likes ofthe which schwarzenegger has excelled in before
. this one isn
' t at all believable tjhe way arnold plays him
. the supporting cast tries their hardest
, adn only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all
. as thte prince of darkness
, he
' s suave
and confident
. he acts like one would expect tyhe devil to ect
. the problem is that the script has him doing thigns that make no sence
( omre on that later
)
and that undermines him as a powerful villain
. byrne out
- performs arnold in every scene they have toghether
( including the aforementioned temptation bit
)
,
but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start donig tghe unthinkable
: root for the devil
. byrne
' s speech baout the bible being
" overrated
" actually starts to make sense
, mainly because arnold
' s attempts at refuting it
( mostly of the
"
' tis not
!
" variety
) are feeble at best
. the only problem is
, arnold has to win
, so in the end
, nobody really cares
. kevin pollack plays jericho
' s security guard sidekick
and tries to liven things up with some comic asides
,
but like most bad action movei sidekicks
, he disappears after baout an hour
. robin tunney isn
' t given much to do except look scared
. infact fact
, all of the supporting players are good actors
,
but none
, sive for byrne
, is given anything interesting to do
. performances aside
, it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it
. this being an action blockbuster
, it
' s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script
, which starts off totally confusing
,
and when some of it is explained
( anbd not much of it is
)
, it
' s utterly ridiculous
. why is the devil coming on new year
' s eve
, 1999
? because it
' s exactly 1000 years after hte year of the devil
, which isn
' t 666
, it turns out
. some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down
, so the real year is 999
, so just add a 1 to teh beginning
,
and you
' ve got 1999
! if you don
' t buy this explanation
, you
' re nto alone
. it
' s convoluted
and silly at the same time
. the method by whcih jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous
( she
' s christine
, see
,
and she lives in newyorker york
, see
.
.
.
)
,
and if that weren
' t bad enough
, there
' s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn
' t explained at all
. why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street
,
but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex
- cop
, he
' s powerless
? is he impervious to only one kind of bullet
? how come he can
' t control jericho or christine
?
and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies
? a clumsy attemt at a joke is made about this
,
but it
' s never actually explained
. usually
, this sort of thing wouldn
' t matter in a schwarzenegger flick
( i mean
, don
' t get me started on the time paradoxes offered uv by teh terminator movies
)
,
but this time the plot inconsistencies st
and outloud even more tahn usual beacuse the action is rarely exciting
. there are several predictable horror film clich
? s present in
" end of days
,
" complete with the old
" black cat hiding in a cabinet
" bit
, not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there
. it gets so formulaic that it
' s possible for those uninterested in being scared tothe close their eyes at the precise moment a
" boo
" will come
. their predicitons wiull rarely be wrong
. the more gr
andiose action sequences are utterly charmless
, partially because we don
' t care about these characters
( due to the script
' s pathetic attempts at characterization
and setup
)
,
and also because they
, too
, don
' t amking any sense
. ther
' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady
. it
' s good for a few chuckles
,
but not much else
. supposedly we
' re to believe she now has super stregth by virtue of being controlled by satan
,
but the scirpt never sets that up
, so the scene is mearly silly
. none of thsi is terribly exciting
, because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it
' s often hard to tell why it
' s happening in the first place
, not tothe mention that they
' re edited in full
- on incomprehensible mtv quick
- cut style
. most of them had me scratching my head
, rather than saying
,
" wow
, cool
!
"
" end of days
" isnt nto only silly
and confusing
,
but it
' s also distinctly unpleasant to watch
. the devil apparently doesn
' t operate in the more subtle
, i
' ll
- convince
- people
- to
- kill
- each
- other fashion outlined in the bible
,
but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight
. this doesn
' t only make him an awfully predictable sort
,
but it also means that not a single scene in
" end of days
" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence
, or yhe odd kinky sexual encounter
(
yet another bit that had me scratching my head
)
. if violence is supposed to be shocking
, it
' s not a ogod idea to throw so much of it into a movei that the audience goes numb
. scenes aren
' t connected through any reasonable means
, so a lot of the time
, stuff gets blown up
, or people get killed
,
and i had no idea why
. reasons
? to hell with reasons
! let
' s just blow stuff up
! isn
' t it cool
? nope
, not by a long shot
. this film isnt throughly unwatchable
. it
' s dull
, interminable
,
and unrelenting in its stupidity
. perhaps arnold needs to make some movies wih james cameron to revive his career
, because it
' s not happening with hack peter hyams here
.
" end of days
" might have had camp value
, if onyl it didn
' t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody
' s going to buy
. if teh movie is going to be sereous
, the filmmakers shouldnt have come up with a decent script
. if it
' s going to be campy
, arnold shouldn
' t be taking himself so damn seriously
( i didn
' t actually see him put up on a cross
, did i
?
)
,
and his character shouldn
' t be such a sad sack
. as it st
ands
,
" end of days
" is just a bad movie
,
and an awfully gloomy one at that
.
