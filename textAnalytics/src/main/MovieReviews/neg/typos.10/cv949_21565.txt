` bats
' is an insulting slap across the face fo any dedicated horror movie fan
. to pull something like this off
, you need tothe have a sense of wit
and style
, with a heavy dosage of humor tothe bakc up the process if the fright factor ever declines
. something like the underground worm thriller
` tremors
' had jstu tjhe perfect mixture of these elements
,
and in return
, the film was tremendous fun
. wih the notable exception ofthe a wisecracking supporting player
,
` bats
' mainly plays it
' s premise for straight
- arrow horror
. judging by tjhe ridiculous premise
, this was not exactly a wise move
. the movie attemts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock
' s
` the birds
'
,
but fails miserably
. done right
, it could have been adequately amusing hallowen cinema
. unfortunately
,
` bats
' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly
, terribly wrong
. the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audiance to be
. i will recite hte follwoing paragraph in a manner that will reach tje audience ofthe individuals to whom
` bats
' isnt aimed toward
. those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats
. these bats are not very nice
, because htey eat a lot of people
. boy
, are these bats ugly
. they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super
- duper smart
. they
' ve got big claws
and red eyes
and they are not very friendly at all
. a whole bunch ofthe people in texas git killed
, so a sheriff guy
and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats
. they have big guns
and other cool things to fight them with
,
but the bats are pretty smart
, so it
' s sorta hard to do
. the bats swoop down
and they shoot at them to make they go away forthe good
.
but no
,
` bats
' is probably too violent for pre
- schoolers
. the film
, directed by louis morneau
, should have ventured straight into video storse
. on the small screen
, perhaps more funn could have been derived with lower expectations
.
but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward
;
al
though at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure
, the film isnt poorly written
, poorly acted
and executed with glaring ineptitude
. even the bats themselves are cheesy
, annd the attack sequences too rushed
and jittery to be properly enjoied
. the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey
( lou diamond phillips
)
, who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small
- town authority figure usually portrays
( he chomps on a cigar
, struts contentedly in his boots
, etc
.
.
.
)
. tghe scientist is dr
. sheila casper
( dina meyer
)
, who specializes in flying mammals
and isnt classified as
` the best in her field
'
. meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable
,
but everything about dr
. casper is recycled beyond recognition
. her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously liuke oceanographic student matt hooper
' s tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in
` jaws
'
. everything revolving around
` bats
' is tired drivel
, wich desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up
. the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw
, with voices dubbed in later
. in fact
, that may have worked outloud better in the end
. take one glance at casper
' s bat
- loathing sidekick jimmy
( leon
)
,
and you
' ll have immediate deja vu
- he
' s the exact same humorous buddy charicatoor from every other movei
, constructed specifically for timed comic releaf
. unfortunatly
, none of his comic interludes are funny
. in the role of deranged mad scientist dr
. mccabe
, hte reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character infront the bunch
. mccabe
` accidentally
' released two experimental test subjects
,
and the virus spread to other bats
. the entire town of gallup
, texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures
, bu gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else
. something like
:
` when is the damn movie going to be over
?
? i just want my money
.
' the bats are ugly
, i must say
. there
' s the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing
,
but mainly
, the swarm isnt represented in cheesy digital imagery
. only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been
,
but by the absurdly stupid climax
, it
' s way too late in the game for a decent recovery
. characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire
. let
' s explore tjhe logic there
: is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population
?
? you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents
and not even wound one
,
and after that there are only 18
, 000 mroe of them
. this kind of behavior represents the regluar level of intelligence behind
` bats
'
.
