` bats ' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan
. tothe pull something liuke this off
, you need to have a sence of witn
and style
, wtih a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines
. something like the underground worm thriller
` tremors ' had jstu the perfect mixture of these elements
,
and in return
, the film was tremendous fun
. with tyhe notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player
,
` bats ' mailny plays it ' s premise for straight
- arrow horror
. judging by the ridiculous premise
, this was not exactly a wise move
. the movie attempts to capture the essence ofthe alfred hitchcock ' s
` the birds '
,
but fails miserably
. done right
, it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema
. unfortunately
,
` bats ' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly
, terribly wrong
. tghe only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how inteligable the filmmakers anticipate their core audeince to be
. i will recite the following paragraph in a manner tht will reach the audience of individuals to whom
` bats ' is aimed toward
. those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats
. these bats are not very nice
, because they eat a lot of people
. boy
, are these bats ugly
. they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super
- duper smart
. they ' ve got big claws
and red eyes
and htey are not very friendly at all
. a whole bunch of peopel in texas get killed
, so a sheriff guy
and a scientist lady are broght in to kill the bats
. tehy have big guns
and other cool things to fight them with
,
but the bats are pretty smart
, so it ' s sorta hard to do
. the bats swoop down
and they shoot at them to make htey go away for good
.
bu no
,
` bats ' is probably too violent for pre
- schoolers
. the film
, directed by louis morneau
, should have ventured straight into video stores
. on the small screen
, perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations
.
but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward
;
although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure
, the film is poorly written
, poorly acted
and executed with glaring ineptitude
. even tje bats themselves are cheesy
,
and tje attack sequences too rushed
and jittery to be properly enjoyed
. the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey
( lou diamond phillips
)
, who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small
- town authorithy figure usually portrays
( he chomps on a cigar
, struts contentedly in his boots
, etc
.
.
.
)
. the scientist is dr
. sheila casper
( dina meyer
)
, who specializes in flying mammals
and is classified as
` the best in her field '
. meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make thge movie seem more intellectually capable
,
but everything about dr
. casper is recycled beyond recognition
. her memories of how she became hooked onthe the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper ' s tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in
` jaws '
. everything revolving around
` bats ' is tired drivel
, which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up
. the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw
, with voices dubbed in later
. in fact
, that may have worked out better in the end
. take noe glance at casper ' s bat
- loathing sidekick jimmy
( leon
)
,
and you ' ll have immediate deja vu
- he ' s the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie
, constructed specifically for timed comic relief
. unfortunately
, none of his comic interludes are funny
. in the role of deranged mad scientist dr
. mccabe
, the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch
. mccabe
` accidentally ' released two experimental tust subjects
,
and the virus spread to other bats
. the entire town ofthe gallup
, texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures
,
but gunton appears tothe be inconspicuously contemplating something else
. something like
:
` when is the damn movie going to be over
?
? i jsut want my money
. ' the bats are ugly
, i must say
. there ' s the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing
,
but mainly
, the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery
. only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been
,
bu by the absurdly stupid climax
, it ' s way too late in the game for a decent recovery
. characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire
. let ' s explore the logic ther
: isnt this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population
?
? you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents
and not even wound one
,
and after that there are only 18
, 000 more of them
. htis kind of behavior represents tje regular level of intelligence behind
` bats '
.
