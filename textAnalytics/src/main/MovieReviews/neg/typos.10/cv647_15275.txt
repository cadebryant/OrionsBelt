the first inthe a very long list of things wrong with
" i still know what you did last summer
" is the title
. think about it for a second
. if the last movie was called
" i konw what you did lsat summer
"
, wouldn ' t the next movie have tothe be
" i still know whta you did two summers ago
"
? if anyone working on this movie had an i
. q
. greater than five would have thought about it logically
and said
,
" hey
.
.
. wait a minute
"
.
bu alas
, the people behind thsi film are obviously idiots
, so i won ' t hold them to that
. what i will hold them to is the fatc that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands
, even for a teenage slasher flick
. i guess i ' m one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film
( empahsis onthe the
" kind of
"
)
. it wasn ' t great or anything
and maybe not even necessarily good
,
but at least it didn ' t have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it ' s sequel did
. there are just so many problems with this movie that it ' s hard trying to figure out where to start
. first of all
, i guess
, is the setting
. the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place inaddition the bahamas
, other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting
. exactly why does the fisherman want tothe go through all the trouble ofthe faking a ardio contest to git julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
, one of the only survivors of the first film
)
and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up
? the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through
. in one scene
, julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in
and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can ' t git out
, no matter how hard she tries
. when julie discovers she ' s going to slowly fry to death
, she screams for halp
and her friends come to her rescue
. now
, this is all fine
and dandy except for oney thing
; instead of spending five minutes trying tothe bust open the booth
, why not just turn the freakin ' thing off
? in another scene
, one of the characters
, after hvaing their significant other all
but decapitated by the man in the slicker
, says to julie
,
" just don ' t tell anybody it rained the wohle time
.
" oh yeah
, i ' ve just beeen terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath
and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered
,
but hey
, i ' ll crack jokes anyway
. aftter all
, it is in the script
. the film ' s only saving graces are a few well
- executed suspense sequences
and a really cool cameo by the
" re
- animator himself
, jeffrey combs
. he brings some good comic relief
and life to an otherwise limp movei
. way to go
, jeffrey
. i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it ' s head above water is the recent abcense of writer kevin williamson
. with
" scream
"
and even it ' s sequel
, he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter
. his ear for dialogue
and the terific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers
,
and i think
" i still know
" has really suffered by not having him on board
. the cool athmosphere is still there this time around
,
but i just didn ' t like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one
. even
though the movie doesn ' t have williamson
, it still has a hacky ending
, trying to do what kevin did with the first twpo
" scream
" s by
( some may consider this a spoiler
,
but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever
,
then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes
) having two killers
and
, this time
, having one of them being a family member to the other
. i think someone in the audience put it best wehn
, after the movie had ended with another
" the killer is back
!
" cliffhanger
, he said
" who is this time
, the grandma
?
" all in all
,
" i still know
" tries to be as successful as tje first the film was
,
bu really fails in the attempt
. i mean
, it ' s okay when slasher movies rip
- off each other
,
but when they start copying themselves
.
