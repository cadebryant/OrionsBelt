the first in a very long list of things wrong with
" i still know what you did last summer
" is the title
. think about it for a second
. if hte last movie was called
" i know what yuo did last summer
"
, wouldn
' t the next movie have to be
" i still know what you did two summers ago
"
? if anyone working on this movie had an i
. q
. greater than five would have
thought about it logically
and said
,
" hey
.
.
. wait a minute
"
.
but alas
, the peopel behind this film are obviously idiots
, so i won
' t hold them to that
. what i iwll hold them to is the fact that they hvea a pretty bad movie on their h
ands
, even for a teenage slasher flick
. i guess i
' m one of the few critics who actually kind of liekd the original film
( emphasis onthe the
" kind of
"
)
. it wasn
' t great or anything
and maybe not even necessarily good
,
but at least it didn
' t have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like it
' s sequel doed
. there are just so many problems with this movie that it
' s hard trying tothe figure out where to start
. first of all
, i guess
, is the setting
. the movei offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in hte bahamas
, other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting
. exactly why does the fisherman wnat to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james
( jennifer love hewitt
, one ofthe the only survivors ofthe the first film
)
and her new coleeg buddies out tothe the isl
ands before he hacks them up
? the movie suffers from this kind of logic all yhe way through
. in one scene
, julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in
and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress can
' t get out
, no matter how hard she tries
. when julie discovers she
' s going to slowy fry to death
, she screams forthe help
and her friends come to her rescue
. now
, this is all fine
and d
andy except forthe one thing
; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth
, why not just turn the freakin
' thing off
? in another scene
, one of the characters
, after having their significant other all
but decapitated by the man in the slicker
, syas to julie
,
" just don
' t tell anybody it rained the whole time
.
" oh yeah
, i
' ve jsut been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath
and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered
,
but hey
, i
' ll crack jokes anyway
. after all
, it isnt infact the scirpt
. the film
' s only saving graces are a few well
- executed suspense sequences
and a realyl kool cameo by the
" re
- animator himself
, jeffrey combs
. he brings some good comic releaf
and life to an otherwise limp movie
. way tothe go
, jeffrey
. i have a hunch thyat the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept it
' s head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson
. with
" scream
" adn even it
' s sequel
, he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter
. his ear for dialogue adn tje terrific endings he puts onthe all his films make him a st
andout from all the rest of the horror writers
,
and i think
" i still know
" has really suffered by not having him on board
. the cool atmosphere is still there this time around
,
but i just didn
' t like the characters or the writing as much as i doed in the first one
. even
though the movie doesn
' t have williamson
, it still has a hacky endig
, trying to do what kevin did with the first two
" scream
" s by
( some may consider this a spoiler
, bu if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever
,
then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes
) having two killers anbd
, this time
, having one of them being a family member to the other
. i think someone in the audience put it best when
, after the movie had ended with another
" the killer is back
!
" cliffhanger
, he said
" who is this time
, the gr
andma
?
" all in all
,
" i still knwo
" tries to be as successful as tjhe first the film was
,
but really fails in the attempt
. i mean
, it
' s okay when slasher movies rip
- off each other
,
but when they start copying themslves
.
.
