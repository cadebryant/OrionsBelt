i should have known
, damn it
, i should have known
. ewan mcgregor
- codename
:
" eye
"
- is pointing a high
- tech rifle
- ly gadget at a fat
, bald business
- oriented american engaging iin illicit sexual actvities in a window across thge street
. we get tje requisite electro
- green through
- the
- sight view
. we the audience
, seeing a high tech rifle
- ly gadget
, of course think that eye is going tothe assassinate the target
,
but instead
, he pulls the trigger
and yhe rifle takes twenty or so hazy
, low
- quality photographs
, which eye thne proceeds tothe fax
and e
- mail to everyone in his target
' s office
. all right
, so thirty seconds in
, i was slightly befuddled by this seamingly pointless rifle
/ camera
, bu i was still open minded
.
.
. maybe htere
' s a really good reason for it
. i
' ve got reason to believe
, you see
- i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor
' s previous work
.
.
.
and he
' s obi wan ke
- friggin
- nobi for god
' s sake
.
and director stephan elliot
' s last movei priscilla
, queen of the desert was a quirky little delight
. there
' s some genuine talent involved here
. i think at the twenty minute mark
, there was still a spark of hope in my heart
. eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization
' s son
( i still have no idea what this organization was
- british intelligence
? national spy ring
? private investigation
?
)
, who is apparently stealing from his trust fund
. he has received his assignment from k
. d
. lang
, through an elaborate
and expensive teleconferencing briefcase
. when eye tracks his target to an expensive
- looking secluded house
, he witnesses a mysterious
and beatiful woman
( ashley judd
) take a knife out
and proceed to stab the poor bastard
. ok
, that
' s odd
, i think to myself
, this could be interesting
.
then she starts to cry
,
and through her tears exclaims
" merry christmas
, dad
!
" for the first time
. so begins our tale of obsession
.
.
. or
.
.
. something
. the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor
' s eye character following ashley judd arround to every corner of the united states
, totally
and completely obsessed by thsi woman fomr afar
. throughout his entire professional life
, he has been a voyeur
; so when he falls for someone
, the only way he can h
andle it is to watch
and drool through telescopes
and cameras
. fine
, that
' s a lovely premise
, i suppose
.
but gosh darn it
, if ytou
' re going to go there
, you better have some sort ofthe explanation
.
and that
' s precisely where this film fails
. this is the kind of movie that pisses me off
. it
' s an abortion
, a collection of half
- formed
and wasted idaes that amounts to absolutely nothing infact the end
. it pretends it isnt something that it is not
- a surreal
and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high
- tech thriller
. here
, the filmmakers have confused
" surreal
" anbd
" deep
" whith
" vaguely unclear
"
and
" crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors
.
" i never
, even for an instant
, had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in
" love
" whith this woman who changes wigs
and kills people
. the movie offers only two explanations
, neither of which make a lick of sense
. explanation number oney
: the obnoxious presence of eye
' s imaginary daughter
, who was taked away from him by his wife some time ago
, tells him he shouldn
' t leave ms
. judd
. explanation two
, which by the end of yhe film has been beaten inot our heads through imagery
and dialog
and even the title of the movie
:
" beauty is in the eye of the beholder
.
" whoo hoo
, that helps
, thanks a bunch
, case closed
. that
' s as deep as it gets
, folks
. there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes
, which
, instead of tying everything together
, ends up bieng as profound as a clever sixth
- grade mad lib
. there are secondary characters thgat move in
and outloud of the picture anbd serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was
. my personal favorites include
: the prison
- matron modeled after austin powers
' frau farbissina
, who apparently taught ms
. judd everything she knows about wearing wigs
; jason priestley
' s awfully palyed dirty desert vagrant
# 1
, who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet
,
but fails miserably
;
and the cop
- who
- sees
- ashley
- fleeing
- an
- accident
- scene
-
and
-
then
- wants
- tothe
- pay
- for
- sex
-
but
- isnt
- shot
. each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last
. the script pays no attention to the laws of time
and spoace
. any time one of the frequent location changes occurs
, the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe
,
and mintues
, weeks
, or yeasr could have passed
. bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair
- one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow
- motion close
- up awash in a lot of bass
. ewan mcgregor at one point tkaes up residence in a bell tower just so he coudl be repeteadly awakened
and deafened by thge giant bell
. jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks
, hten laughs maniacally
.
.
. cut to r
andom guy with eye patch
.
.
. iguana out of focus
.
.
. iguana comes into focus
. wow
, man
. when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel
, it came as no surprize to me
. there are plenty of elements here that
, if extended annd fleshed out moreso
, would have made for a decent story
.
and i wouldn
' t be surprised if i found out there was an hour
and a half ofthe footage cutted from this movie lying inthe a l
andfill somewhere
, or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director
' s cut
.
.
. not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing
. the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye
and the judd that was supposed tothe be some sort of revealing exposition
. some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone
,
and this tiome i didn
' t particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap
; the audience around me chuckled
and whispered sentiments similar to what i ws thinking
. someone near cell
- phone
- guy did eventually yell
,
" shut the hell up
!
"
,
but it was a lot funnier wehn we
thought he was talking to the screen
.
