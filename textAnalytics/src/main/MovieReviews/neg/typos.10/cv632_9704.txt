guilt
. guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time
; the penultimate t
& a thriller
, basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living
.
but i know so well that it
' s a terrible film
, made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt
. verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls
and
, on november seventh
, 1997
, unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me
, who cannot control tghe urge to see giant bug movies
. the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year
. a simple
, white on balck title card reads
" starship troopers
"
- my friends
and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped
, verhoeven realized he forgot the credits
. is this how a hundred million dollar movie shoudln open
? were the rest ofthe the film that subdued
.
.
. starship troopers is about a gropu of white
, blond
- haired himbos
and bimbos who all have spanish last names
. htey graduate high school
, join the miltary
,
and
then
, rather curiously
, decide to travel to an alien planet
and destroy all lifeforms on tath planet
. the story is so incomprehensible
,
and told so bombastically
, it
' s akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue
.
( aside
, club lovers will be happy to knwo that dance music hasn
' t changed inthe thge future
.
) one plus
: starship troopers contains some very funny sequences
, specifically the newsreels of the future
. hysterically funny
, actually
.
but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between
. tyhe storytelling lacks focus
, tothe say the least
. tyhe politics of the film are scary
. the actions of the major female cahracters are dictated by their out
- of
- control libidos
. there
' s even a creepy sex scene
: the lovely dina meyer makes out
, nude
, with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater
, just the way he seems tothe like it
. i use the term sickening because van dien is tjhe least appealing actor i
' ve encountered in a big budget picture
; all chiseled features annd machismo
, he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders
. of course
, verhoeven
' s probably the one to blame
,
and perhaps i
' m jealous because i
' m so disgusting
. at any rate
, a movie called starship troopers shouldn
' t be about sex
. exactly ten years ago
, verhoeven made robocop
, which ws about nothing
but skillfully made
and oddly moving
.
and r
- rated
, despite its goofy premise
. maybe it
' s asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg
- movie
,
then
- he
' s a master of insipid violence
. howver
, ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it
.
