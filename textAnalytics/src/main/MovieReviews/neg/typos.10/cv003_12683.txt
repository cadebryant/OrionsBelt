" quest for camelot
" is warner bros
. ' first feature
- length
, fully
- animated attempt tothe steal clout from disney ' s cartoon empire
,
but the mouse has no reason to be worried
. tje only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall ' s promising
, if flawed
, 20th century fox production
" anastasia
,
"
but disney ' s
" hercules
,
" witht its lively cast
and colorful palate
, had her beat hands
- down when it came time tothe crown 1997 ' s best piece of animation
. this year
, it ' s no contest
, as
" quest for camelot
" is pretty much dead on arrival
. even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre
-
- that ' d be
" pocahontas
" fo thsoe of you keeping score
-
- isn ' t nearly as dull as this
. the stry revolves around the adventures of free
- spirited kayley
( voiced by jessalyn gilsig
)
, the early
- teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur ' s round table
. kayley ' s only dream is to follow in her father ' s footsteps
,
and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber
( gary oldman
)
, an ex
- round table member
- gone
- bad
, steals arthur ' s magical sword excalibur
and accidentally loses it in a dangerous
, booby
- trapped forest
. with the help of hunky
, blind timberland
- dweller garrett
( carey elwes
)
and a two
- headed dragon
( eric idle
and don rickles
) that ' s always arguing wih itself
, kayley just might be able to break the mdeieval sexist mold
and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur ' s side
.
" quest for camelot
" is missing pure showmanship
, an essential element if it ' s ever expeced to climb to the high ranks of disney
. there ' s nothing here that differentiates
" quest
" ffrom something you ' d see onthe any given saturday morning cartoon
-
- subpar animation
, instantly forgettable songs
, poorly
- integrated computerized footage
.
( compare kayley
and garrett ' s run
- in wiht the angry ogre to herc ' s battle with the hydra
. i rest my case
.
) even the characters stink
-
- none of them are remotely interesting
, so much that the film becomes a race to see hwihc one can out
- bland the others
. in the end
, it ' s a tie
-
- they all win
. tyhat dragon ' s comedy shtick is awfully cloying
,
but at least it shows signs of a pulse
. at least fans of the early
- ' 90s tgif televsion line
- uv will be thrilled to find jaleel
" urkel
" white
and bronson
" balki
" pinchot sharing the same footage
. a few scenes are nicely realized
(
though i ' m at a loss to recall enough to be specif
)
,
adn the actors providing the voice talent are enthusiastic
(
though most are paired up whith singers who don ' t sound a thnig like them for their big musical moments
-
- jane seymour
and celine dion
?
?
?
)
.
but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good
. aside ffrom the fact that children will probably be as bored watching this as adults
,
" quest for camelot
" ' s most grievous error is its complete lack ofthe personality
.
and personality
, we learn from this mess
, goes a very long way
.
