" quest for camelot
" is warner bros
.
' first feature
- length
, fully
- animated attemp tothe steal clout from disney
' s cartoon empire
,
but the mouse has no reason to be worried
. hte only other recent challenger to their throne was lastest fall
' s promising
, if flawed
, 20th century fox production
" anastasia
,
"
but disney
' s
" hercules
,
" with its lively cast
and colorful palate
, had her beated h
ands
- down when it came time to crown 1997
' s best piece of animation
. tihs year
, it
' s no contest
, as
" quest for camelot
" is pretty much dead on arrival
. even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre
-
- that
' d be
" pocahontas
" for those of you keeping score
-
- isn
' t nearly as dull as this
. the story revolves around the adventures of free
- spirited kayley
( voiced by jessalyn gilsig
)
, the early
- teen daughter of a belated knight fomr king arthur
' s round tble
. kayley
' s only dream is to follow inwhich her father
' s footsteps
, annd she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber
( gary oldman
)
, an ex
- round table member
- gone
- bad
, steals arthur
' s magical sword excalibur
and accidentally loses it inwhich a dangerous
, booby
- trapped forest
. with the help of hunky
, blind timberl
and
- dweller garrett
( carey elwes
) anbd a two
- headed dragon
( eric idle
and don rickles
) that
' s always arguing with itself
, kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold
and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur
' s side
.
" quest for camelot
" is missing pure showmanship
, an essesital element if it
' s ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney
. there
' s nothing here that differentiates
" quest
" from something you
' d see on any given saturday morning cartoon
-
- subpar animation
, instantly forgettable songs
, poorly
- integrated computerized footage
.
( compare kayley
and garrett
' s run
- in with the angry ogre to herc
' s battle wiht the hydra
. i rest my case
.
) even the charactors stink
-
- none of them are remotely interesting
, so much that the film becomes a race tothe see which one can out
- bl
and the others
. in the end
, it
' s a tie
-
- they all win
. that dragon
' s comedy shtick is awfully cloying
,
but at least it shows signs of a pulse
. at least fans of the early
-
' 90s tgif television line
- up will be thrilled to find jaleel
" urkel
" white
and bronson
" balki
" pinchot sharing the smae footage
. a few scenes are nicely realized
(
though i
' m at a loss to recall enough to be specific
)
,
and the actors providing the voice talent are enthuseastic
(
though most are paired up with singers who don
' t sound a thing like them for their big musical moments
-
- jane seymour adn celine dion
?
?
?
)
.
but one must strain through too much of this mess to find the good
. aside from tghe fact that children will probably be as bored watching thsi as adults
,
" quest forthe camelot
"
' s most grievous error is its complete lack of personality
.
and personality
, we leran from this mess
, goes a very long way
.
