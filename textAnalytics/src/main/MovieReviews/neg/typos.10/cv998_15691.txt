there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror directer
. of course
, his best film was 1978
' s masterpiece
,
" halloween
,
"
but he also made 1980
' s
" teh fog
,
"
and 1987
' s underrated
,
" prince of darkness
.
" heck
, he even made a ogod film in 1995
, with
" in the mouth of madness
.
"
but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992
, with the terrible comedy
,
" memoirs of an invisible man
.
" somehow
, carpenter has lost his touch
, with junk like his failed 1995 remake of
,
" village of the damned
,
" to his uninspired 1996 sequel
,
" escape from l
. a
.
" those movies
, howver
, look liuke cinematic works of art compaired tothe his latest film
,
" john carpenter
' s vampires
.
" if i was him
, i definately wouldn
' t want to put my own name in the title
. it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided
and flatly writed
and filmed as
,
" vampires
.
" the story is simple
. jack crow
( james woods
) is a vampire hunter who
, along withthe one ofthe his partners
, montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
, anbd a prostitute
, katrina
( sheryl lee
)
, survives an attack from the master vampire
, valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
. since katrina was previously bitten by him
, crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later
,
and crow is hoping tothe find him wtih the halp ofthe her
. it seems valek
' s mission is to steal a black
, wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him
. my question is
: how many time have we seen this smae story played out
? well
, the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made
.
" john carpenter
' s vampires
,
" sadly enough
, is one ofthe the most unscary horror films i
' ve ever seen
. in fact
, there isn
' t even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105
- minute running time
. the non
- stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed
, wihtout any interesting camera wokr
, which is usually a trademark of carpenter
' s
.
and
then we come to the screenplay
, whitch
, as far as i can tell
, is nearly non
- existent
. there is no story development
, anbd there isn
' t even an attemt to flesh out the characters
. james woods can be a good actor
,
but he has nothing to do here
but to say a couple of
" pseudo
"
- clever lines of dialogue
. daniel baldwin has some potential
,
but his character comes off as being very dense
.
and sheryl lee
( faring much better as laura palmer in
" twin peaks
"
)
, like all of the female characters
, plays an offensive stereotypical whore
. there is not an ounce of intelligence
, or excitment in
,
" john carpenter
' s vamires
,
" which is very disheartening coming from an ex
- fan of carpenter
' s
. he has said that he turned down directing
,
" halloween
: h20
,
" because he couldn
' t work up any excitement fo it
.
and
yet
, when asked about a
" vampires
" sequel
, he said he would be happy to dont it
. i think that
' s a definite sign that carpenter has finaly lost any trace of his lasting talent
, not to mention a signficiant number of iq points
.
