tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk outloud 20 minutes into the movie
. the film
( which oppened infact canada during 1992
but was never released inaddition the untied states
) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage
,
and
, hwile it
' s evident tyhat this could be a fascinating live production
, the translation to the screen is a creative disaster
. enduring tectonic plates is like sitting thru a filmed version of performance art
-
- lifeless
and tedious
. the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium
. tectonic plates has a storyline
,
al
though the narrative is developed in a decidedly non
- traditional fashion
, with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences
. it
' s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie
( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious
, all
-
but
- screaming
,
" look
! art
!
"
)
,
al
though it keeps hte audience distanced from the characters
. because we
' re constantly made aware that we
' re watching a play or a movie
, it
' s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer
' s ideas
. they
' re not real
, sympathetic
, or believable
. i
' m willing to give directer peter mettler credit for trying something different
,
but this particular experiment is not a success
. tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine
( marie gignac
)
, an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor
, jacques
( lapage
)
. one day
, he disappears
,
and
, fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love
, madeleine travels to venice to kill herself
. while preparing tothe commit suicide
, she encounters drug addict constance
( celine bonnier
)
, who causes madeleine to re
- tihkn her decision
. meanwhile
, jacques has moved to new york city
, where he starts cross
- dressing
, calls himself jennifer
,
and becomes a successful counter
- culture talkshow host
. with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotl
and
, supporting characters that include a topless goddess
and a deaf
/ mute
,
and cultural references that point to chopin
, george s
and
,
and jim morrison
, tectonic plates is unique
, if nothing else
.
however
, as intresting as the film sounds
(
and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising
)
, it never really delivers
. the tone is soporific
, the supposedly
- intellectual prattle is inane adn uninteresting
, the plot me
anders in a pointless
and irritating manner
(
al
though it doesn
' t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largley unimportant
)
,
and the symbolism is obvious
. tectonic plates is trying to show thgat human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as tjhe shifting of the earth
, bu it takes one
- hundred minutes to get across this transparent point
. there are some worthwhile moments
, such as a silly sword fight between jacques
and the topless godess
and an entertaining discussion in both french adn english about the differences between the two laguages
(
al
though the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren
' t bilingual
)
. tje only people likely tothe enjoy tectonic plates are those who efel a strong need to praise something this rootless
and boring because
( a
) it
' s different
,
( b
) it
' s not like anything they
' ve seen before
, annd
( c
) it
' s pretentious
. for everyone else
, it
' s not only a waste of time
,
but a poor introduction to the wokr of robert lapage
.
