when i wass nine
, i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store
. masters of the universe wass the pinnacle of what i wass after for action figures
: they combined science fiction annd fantasy
, had cool names like mekanek
and stinkor
and each came with its own little comic book to read
. ofthe course
, the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history
. given the tremendous success of the toys
and the cartoon
( not to mention its moderately successful spin
- off she
- ra
: princess of power
)
, it was inevitable that a production company would put two
and twpo together
, come with the result of
" trillions
"
and make a live
- action masters movei
. let
' s be blunt
: masters of the universe is a very bad movie
. yhe story is painfully dull
and mind
- numbingly cliched
( h
ands uv who
* wouldn
' t
* guess he
- man
and skeletor take their fight into teh real world
)
and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors
( dolph lundgren as he
- man for one
) or good actors
( james tolkan
, meg foster
) given such awful characters
and dialogue that they can
' t help
but seem terrible
. it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as ogod as star wars
. we have the alien bounty hunters
, the desert skif technolgy
, stormtrooper lookalikes
and a muscial score so reminiscent of john williams that
" deja vu
" is too polite a term to use in describing it
.
" blatant uninspired ripoff
" would appear more appropriate
. tv fans might want to check out courtney cox
( monica in friends
) annd robert duncan mcneill
( lt paris in star trek
: voyager
)
, vyer early in their careers
and not doing to well in them either
. so infact the face of such mindless sub
- mediocrity
, is there anything tothe make masters of the universe worth watching at all
? yes
, there is
. oen incredible good reason
. his name is frank langella
. langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood
, appearing in countless films over the years
. here he plays skeletor
, the villain of the piece
. dressed in opulent black velvet robes
and bearing a skull for a face
, he is one part darth vader
, one part emperor
and twpo parts grim reaper
. given this character
, langella falls right into it with style
and precision
. skeletor is believable
, interesting
and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past
and startlingly originnal in his own right
. masters of the universe
. i remember loving it wehn i was eleven
. at twenty one it
' s difficult to see why
.
but
, as i said
, it is blessed withthe a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium ofthe the remainder
. besides
, this year marks the film
' s 10th anniversary
. watch it with some friends fo a good laugh
and celebrate
.
