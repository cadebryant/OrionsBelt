riendeer games is easily the worst ofthe the three recent films penned by ehren kruger
( scream 3 annd arlington rd are the others
, each derivative in their own special way
)
. the guy can
' t seem to write believable dialogue
( sample from reindeer games
:
" rule
# 1
: never put a car thief behind the wheel
"
)
, create multi
- faceted characters
, or even engineer coherent plots
but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists
and turns
( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely
)
. his screenplay forthe reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with noone reward anywhere in sight
. i cxan jsut envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard
,
" oh you
thought my movie was gonna go here
, f
* ck you jack ass
, take that twist
, decipher this mother f
* cker
!
" it
' s almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie
.
and why the hell would anyone want to invest tiem in a movie when the screenwriter keesh changing his pwn rules for no reason other tahn to congratulate hismelf on how damn clever he is
? auteur theory be damned
; it
' s kruger
' s
" style
"
, not the director
' s that winds up on screen
. kruger has obviously never paid much mind tothe thge old chestnut
" sometimes less is more
"
.
and his numerous twists can
' t even claim to be originals
; arlington rd
' s ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j
. pakula thriller the parallax veiw
,
and in riendeer games we get thsi ol
' gem
; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn
' t know
( pronouns used to protect tyhe gender of the
" charcter
"
.
.
. grammar be damned
)
.
" how did you knwo that
?
" the stunned protagonist asks
, suddenly realizing that thge character was in on the whole thing all along
.
.
. since twist endings are currently so in vogue
, annd seeing as how kruger
' s screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending
, i guess it
' s no wonder why he works so frequently
. he
' s quickly becoming miramax
' s mickey mouse
; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects
. this is appropriate considering that miramax
( which used to place their label onthe some of teh most artistically daring films
) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports
( life is beautiful
) adn freddie prinze jr
. vehicles
. theri company
' s current logo could be
" we ride the trends
"
. riendeer games stars ben affleck as rudy
, a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days
and nights behind bars with fantasies of peacn pies dancing atop his head
.
al
though affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness
, he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging thru a police academy flick
. affleck is such a puppy dog tath it
' s impossible to believe he coudl survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone
' s bitch
. the role itself isnt so badly written
( the character onyl grows balls when tghe plot calls for it
)
, the twists so outrageous
,
and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close tothe self parody as i can recall a receet
" serious
" movie getting
. it may have been wiser hadnt the film makers simply went all the way in that direction
, casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal
and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy
( who
' s played here by gary sinise inspite
yet another over the top villain performance
) james frain is nick
, rudy
' s cellmate
, a manslaughterer who
' s found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason
( charlize theron
)
. ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her
though she
' s never seen one picture of him
. whihc works out fine since the character is killed in a near
- riot
,
and rudy
( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick
) takes his place
, which leads to a sudden
and vyre frenzied sex scene between ashley
and rudy
( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape
)
and a surprise visit from ashley
' s brother
, gabriel
( gary sinise
)
, who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co
- horts
. he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who
, according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley
, used to work as a guard in the indian casino
.
though by tyhe end
, the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i
' ve decribed might as well be irrelevant
. this is what you can expect should you chose tothe take this riendeer onthe
; several scenes in which
, after catching his prey
, the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance tothe kill his captor
and crack a stupid one
- liner
. included
: two
( 2
) scenes of two
( 2
) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him
( one following the other no less
)
.
though it
' s an action film
, the ending is more a talkfest where we get tghe whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another hwile affleck looks on
, incredulous as the audience
. the flick was directed by john frankenheimer
, a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian c
andidate early in his career
, fell off the a
- list following a string of flops
and now
, in his old age
, is slowly climbing his way back up
. it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts bu his lastr major film was ronin
( one ofthe those almost
but not quite movies
) which followed tjhe isl
and of dr
. morneau
( you remember
, the one with marlon br
ando in mime make
- up
and a not so flattering moo
- moo
)
,
and now this
. he films acation sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together
and laid out for a brain
- zapped mtv audience to pick aart
. problem isnt these action scenes
( nearly all failed escapes
) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time
and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play
. character problems abound
; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next doorjam earnestness
and hard edged wiseacre
, the latter of which is not
( at least at this point
) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off
. the former he can do with ease
and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl
and swaer
.
but
then suddenly affleck starts growling
and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster
. charlize theron
, an extraordinary talent
, is
, like affleck
, playing whatever part the script requires her to play
, whether it be vulnerability at one moment
, anger at the next
. she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attri
butes
( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this
. gary sinise has played thsi role frequently
,
and here
, as in snake eyes
, he does the snarling bad guy thing wih such over the top vitriol
( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going outloud of control isnt the only thing that keeps him interested any more
)
, that it becomes more ofthe an annoyance
( oh there he goes again
?
?
?
) tahn a threat
. these are talented people who made tjhe mistake of jumping on to a script with little
but stock characters
and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience
.
