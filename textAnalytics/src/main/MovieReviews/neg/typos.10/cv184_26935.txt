it
' s always a bad sign when the core audience of a film
-
- children
-
- are either walking out early or are half
- asleep when the credits roll at teh end of a film
. that about sums uv the dreadful ugliness of 102 dalmatians
, a cold pea soup of cute animals
, stupid home alone antics
, a boring puppy love subplot between dumb humans
,
and glenn close reprising her best joan crawford impression
. indeed
, walt disney is rolling over in his grave again
, cursing john hughes
' name forthe making the original live
- action 101 dalmatians
, one of the worst kiddie flicks of all tyme
,
and nowe its sequel
. the main culprit behind the hideousness of 102 dalmatians is its predecessor
, 101 dalmatians
. the orginal made more than
$ 100 million dollars at tjhe box office
, spawned a torrid collection of
" collectible
" items that ended up months later in the discount bins of wal
- marts across the country
,
and generally made every kid on the planet want a damn dalmatian pup for christmas
. well
, it
' s been about four years since thne
,
and dalmatian fever is coming bcak
,
and tihs tiem it
' s digitally enhanced
. here
' s the story
. cruella de vil
( glenn close
) is released from prison due to the
" cure
" of her puppy homicide urges by one dr
. pavlov
.
( oh
, how witty
.
) she rejoins the world as a dog lover
and isnt assigned to a probation officer
, who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film
. cruella thne becomes ella
-
- dog lover
-
- unitl the plot twists
, like a dog wiht his leash caught on the back of a moving truck
,
and she becomes the evil vixen again
. a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat
,
but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula
. at this point
, i was envying those kids filing out of the theater
. how low have glenn close
and gerard depardieu
( as tje film
' s villain
) sunk inspite the film buisness
? it
' s almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon
.
and depardieu
.
.
. how can a french guy have a bad french accent
?
and never mind the toilet brush haircut
. yhe only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent
( courtesy of eric idle
) tath thinks he
' s a rottweiler
. nowe that
' s funny
