" knock off
" is exactly that
: a cheap knock off ofthe an action movie
. it
' s aslo the worst movie i have seen thus far this eyar
. i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998
,
but alas
, it has already been found
. jean
- claude van damme stars as
( i think
) a designer jeans executive who dicovers his half
- brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods
. rob schneider plays van damme
' s partner
,
and rochon plays
.
.
. actually
, i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be
. she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as tothe why she was there
. many things are not explained in this film
,
but i do know that for some bizarre reason
, van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout teh flick
. where chan comes off as endearing in his
" normal guy
" character seen in many of his films
, van damme just comes off as a wimp
. we
' re never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions
. tothe be more clear
: i did not even nkwo who he ws supposed tothe be until about an hour inot the movie
,
and even
then
, it was not made too clear
. the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong
. tsui hark
( who directed van damme
' s last movie
, the bad
,
but not nearly as bad as this
,
" double team
"
) never lets the camera rest fo a second
,
and that
' s no exaggeration
. we are even treated to a five second shooted from the point ofthe view of van damme
' s foot entering a shoe
. fabulous
! seriously
,
though
, i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions
, as long as tehy don
' t get carried away
. forthe example
, look at sam raimi
.
" army ofthe darkness
"
, one ofthe his best movies
, features some ofthe the most inventive camera work i have ever seen
,
but raimi never lets the special effects get inspite the way of story
. that
' s a concept that tsui can
' t seem to grasp
. the special effects
and outrageous camera angles
* rule
*
" knock off
" to the point where the audience doesn
' t have a clue as to what
' s happening any more
. anyother problem with the film is thyat it looks cheap
. the film stock used is of such low caliber that i
thought i was watching one of those chinese films shown really late at night
. annd for some inexplicable reason
, everyone
' s voice seems to have beeen dubbed
. even the stars
.
and even the special effects
, seemingly the only aspect of the film the director actually cared about
, are inconsistent
. for example
, there is a scene in which van damme drives a car out of a window
. the car slams into tjhe ground
,
and the left wheel is completely destroyed
. seconds later
, the car drives off at full speed
. hey
, i have no problem suspending my disbelief in an action movie
,
but a line must be drawed somewhere
. finally
, the acting
. nobody gives a ogod performance in this film
. van damme
, an actor i usually like
, is way off the mark playing
" everyman
"
.
and schneider
, here to provide comic relief i assume
, is totally unfunny
and over acts his way through every scene
. even the usually solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over
- the
- top performence as
.
.
. once again
, i have no idea who he was supposed to be
. in case i haven
' t
yet made it clear enough
,
" knock off
" is the worst movie ofthe van damme
' s career
and possibly the worst movie of the decade
.
and it
' s not even one of those movies that
' s so bad it
' s funny
. it
' s too inept to be funny
. there are no redeeming factors in
" knock off
"
and i seriously hope that every print of htis film is burned to a crisp
and that somehow my memory of watching the film cant be erased
.
