. critique
: despite this film
' s interesting premise
and dark subject matter
, this movie sucks because it is unfunny
, boring
,
and presents us iwth one ofthe tom everett scott
' s worst acting performances
. add that to a completely unsuccessfull romance element
, many lame
and corny jokes
, a long wait fo the setup
,
and an ending that tkaes all the blackness out of this
" black comedy
"
( if you
' re gonna create a black comedy
, don
' t chicken out in the end
- see very bad things
( 8
/ 10
) for a perfect example
)
, annd you
' ve got yourself a trite mtv creation worthy of its own subject marter
. i barely laughed at any gags
, foudn the bong element contrived
and repetitive
,
and was horrified not to find any gratuitous nudity tossed anywhere in this movie
( if you
' re gonna make a bad college comedy
, at least slap in some free t
& a shots for the kids
:
)
. this one
' s not even worth the rental
, fellas
. skip it altogether
