studio 54 attracted so many weird
and bizzare people to its gates that it
' s a wonder why the film about the life adn death of the studio centers itself on one very boring
, cliched individual
, not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn
' t be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio
, which they did according to this film
. are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated teh studio nightly
, that a character who is a bl
and ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it
?
" 54
" belongs in the elite group of films known as
" the big disappointments
"
: the films that attain so much hype
and
/ or so much potential infact its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are fianlly finished
. i ws heavily awaiting
" 54
,
" not the least becuase i
' ve become fascinated with the infamous club
, which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that
' s been running all summer on vh1
, which is
, weirdly enough
, much more intriguing
and engrossing than thsi
" edgy
" film
. perhaps more importantly
,
" 54
" is part of the blossoming subgenre
,
" the 70s nostalgia film
,
" which has been picking up mighty steam
, what with
" boogie nights
"
and
" the last days ofthe disco
" coming out within the year
,
and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period
( the lite 70s party
and the early 80s wakeup period
)
,
but brung us interesting
and real characters
, like scotty
, the tragically gay boom mike operator from
" boogie nights
,
"
and charlotte
, the ironically clueless
and bitchy co
- protagonist fomr
" tje lastr days of disco
,
" not to mention several others
.
" 54
" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio
( how it began
, how it was run
, how it ended
)
- that
' s all dealt with in the narrated opening
and finale
- bu more interested in the characters who populated it
. this is a definite plus
. here
' s a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party
,
and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases
, economy problems
, anbd perhaps worst of all
, reagan
, all hit
and forced everyone into a rude awakening
. the story of thte studio is tradgedy inwhich itself
: let
' s look at how it all affected the people
.
but this film doesn
' t let that happen
. it gives us a half
- assed protagonist named shane o
' shea
( ryan phillippe
, from
" i know what ytou did last summer
"
)
, who
' s chief character trait is the fact that he
' s from new jersey
, which also happens to be his chief character flaw
( i guess
)
. he
' s dim
- witted
, into being part of
" the scene
,
"
and soon finds he
' s become a bited of a rave amongst the studio regulars
.
.
. a bit like
" saturday night fever
,
"
' cept no travolta
and no real interest put into him
. poor
, poor phillippe struggles to make him intresting
,
but all he is a half
- assed character anbd not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been
. shane begins to hang out whith smoe other denizens of teh club
, like anita
( salma hayek
)
, a wannabe donna sommers
,
and her young hubby
, greg r
andanzo
( breckin meyer
, from
" clueless
"
)
, who helps shane become a bartender
and rise tothe a bit of fame
.
al
though he beggins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster
( sela ward
)
, an exec of sorts
, he falls iin lust with a soap star named julie black
( neve campbell
)
,
and thus the boring romance subplot that
' s all too not necessarily importan to anything else in the film anbd never really becomes interesting at any point in the film
. the film
' s sole point of interest
and one major strongpoint is the all
- too necesary personage of steve rubell
, played by mike myers
( you heard me
)
. rubell
, the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever
,
and isnt an easy methaphor for the life
and times of his creation
,
but the film
, thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers
, makes him out to be more than that
. notice yhe scenes sole shocking scene
, where he trys tothe get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion
: myers brings the humanity to rubell in thsi scene
,
and a couple others
, that some of us who
' ve only seen him on tv never saw
,
and proves tothe be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails
. first time feature director mark christopher proves that he
' s a better director than a writter
,
though nto too terribly much
. his story is trite annd shallow
, as are his characters
,
and his direction isnt shockingly flat
, especially for a film baout this subject
. it
' s as if he had a great story to tell
,
but instead opted for the easier route
. the studio
' s recreation is amazingly accurate
,
though
,
and very impressive
,
but his direction is never captivating enough
. some people say tyhat a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in
( despite the film
' s tone
, i still want to go to rome
and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini
' s
" la dolce vita
"
)
,
and when i watched
" 54
,
" i didn
' t particluarly wanna tothe stay
.
