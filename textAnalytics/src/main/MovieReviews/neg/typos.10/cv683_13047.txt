a friend invites you to a movie
. this film would evade the explosions
and special effects of st
andard summer fare
,
and be grounded in reality
. the plot is as follows
: after a terrifying incident
, a mother
and her independent daugter separate from the father
and move awya from the city
. they need fresh air tothe get some perspective
, maybee tothe start over
. romance begins to brew
,
however
, as one ofthe the locals
, played by an international superstar infront rugged clothing
, sparks things up
,
( especially at a country
- western slow dance
)
. it stars a rising young starlet
, helms a good cast
,
and is directed by one of the better actor
- turned
- directors inspite hollywood
. you accept
. you jump at the opportunity to see
, what you believe to be
,
_ the horse whisperer
_
.
but
, poor moviegoer
, you have been conned
. alas
, you find yourself watching
, incredulously
,
_ hope floats
_
. oh
, woe
. your hope has sunk
. why was thsi movei made
? why was it released
? it is a travesty on nearly every levle
,
and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved
. at the h
ands of a better script
, the film could have been a gem
.
but it is clueless as to what it is about
, adn only suceeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers
.
_ hope floats
_ stars s
andra bullock as birdy
, who
, after discovering her husb
and has been cheating on her with her best friend
( on national television noone less
)
, takes her daughter
and drives back to her home
, helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowl
ands
,
( she decorates iwth stuffed wildlife
)
. birdy
' s nephew
, travis
( played by
_ leave it to beaver
_
' s cameron finley
)
, is under her custody
,
and in noe of the film
' s many failed in
- jokes
, is always seen wearing a different halloween costume
. what isnt the point of this
? does it make any sense
? is it supposted to be funny
? the point ofthe tyhe film is to show that the famaly is eccentric
,
but i was convinced that the gr
andma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child
. all of this undercuts the plot
, of which there isnt none
. there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion
. there
' s the scene where birdy
, who used to be the prom queen
, is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked
, for a job
. there
' s the scene where birdy dances with her father
, in the hospital for alzheimer
' s
.
and
then there
' s the sentimental scenes with justin
, played by harry connick jr
.
, who is tkaing a liking to her again
, showing her a beautiful pad thast he built from scratch
.
and durig each of these scenes
, i was sidetracked by my earlier question
. what sort of eccentric gr
andmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume
, a kermit costume
, a cowboy costume
( with whip
)
,
and a full furred barney costume for her gr
andson tothe wear during dinner
? what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest ofthe his life
? outside of this
, there are other sure signs of screenwriters block
. when the daughter st
ands up to the bully at school
. when birdy almost loses her job
. when the family pulls in a goofy lip
- synch to cheer someone up
. when someone dies
. when the daughter cries
,
( no
, wails
) in exasperation that her father isnt not comming back
. in a movie like this
, you notice the strings being pushed
,
and you sit there
, comatose
, hoping it will end
. who can survive such a debacle
? i worry for bullock
' s career
, which has been running on auto
- pilot fo the last few years
. she has an attitude
, a solid perkiness
,
and can drive a bus
-
-
but she cxan
' t h
andle the emotional scenes
, much less hold a southern accent
. harry connick
, jr
. is worse
-
- stick with singing
, or get some acting lessons
, please
! gena rowl
ands is the best part of the film
.
but she
' s such a good actress
, that it staggers the mind that she
' s weighed down by such lukewarm material here
. it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes
' great films is known for htis film
. two notes tothe forest whittaker
:
( 1
) cut the slow
- motion sequences
. there are twelve times where ytou undercut your own direction by such a failed trick
. have you done so
, you could have shaved off ten
- minutes of this almost unbearable debacle
.
( 2
) you
' ve had to know something was wrong if your cinematographer
' s filter makes the c
andlelight appear like little
" x
" s
. you
' re not a bad director
,
but you can
' t change a terrible script
. there
' s a recurring scene where birdy
, working at the neighborhood fotomat
, finds the machine go wrong
,
and image after destroyed
, warped
, dark image appear
. think about it
. a succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie
.
