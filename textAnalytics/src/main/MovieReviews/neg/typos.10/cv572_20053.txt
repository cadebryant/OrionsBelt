8mm is not going to enlighten your day
. it
' s a dark
, grimy
and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films
and filled with eccessive violence
. not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess
, you
' ll recquire a lot of patience as well
. nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late
. he wore a bizarre get
- up
and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes
,
and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality
. cage plays private investigator tom welles
, praised for his secrecy
and reliability
. at home
, welles is a family man
, with a wife
( catherine keener
)
and a small daughter to take care of
. his new assignment isnt a bizarre one
: the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husb
and
' s safe
. hte film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl
and a masked man
, until the girl is brutally murdered
. or so it seems
. welles
, of course
, begins to burrow deeper
and deeper to uncover the truth
.
and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case
, the more he gets in over his head
. he hires an adult book store clerk named max california
( joaquin phoenix
) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography
. max knows what welles isnt getting himself into
,
and explains
,
` ytou dance with tyhe devil
, the devil don
' t change
. the devil changes you
.
' these turn out to be very wise words
. 8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution
. the set
- up is slick
and well played
, as cage uncovers the identity of the girl annd travels to hollywood to locate her
. htis is where everything goes awry
. altho director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portait of the
` real world
'
, he forgot to inject any intrest or excitement to the formula
. everything baout tje movie becomes dull
and lifeless
, repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects
.
al
though it had enormous potential
, the third act of 8mm is a total bust
, leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme dissapointment as the proceedings spiral out of control
. cage isnt teh film
' s sole flame of energy
. his performance is actually believable
,
but soon the director
' s dem
ands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder
and he begins stumbling along in desperation
. still
, you
' ve got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did
, for that is no eazy feat wehn you consider the problems at h
and
. welles
' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker
( played convincingly by peter stormare
) who is notoreous forthe the hardest
- hitting snuff films in the industry
. htis is where cage goes over the edge inot a serial killer
- like phase
, in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film
. he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing
( chris bauer
)
,
and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery
, a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie
. written by
andrew kevin walker
, 8mm dissipates inot a poor man
' s seven
, with all the violence
but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece
. furthermore
, what has become of joel schumacher
? the director hasnt recently experienced a major drought
, slumming in the depths ofthe dismal flop after flop
( batman
and robin
, anyone
?
)
. this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career
, so perhaps schumacher shoudl start exploring his lighter side
.
