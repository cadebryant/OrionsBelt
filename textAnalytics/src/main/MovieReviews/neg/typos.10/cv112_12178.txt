the sequel to the fugitive
( 1993
)
, u
. s marshals is an average thriller using it
' s association with the fugitive just so it can make a fewd extra bucks
. tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard
, the grizzly cop who was aftter harrison ford in the fugitive
. tihs time
, he
' s after fugitive mark sheridan
( snipes
) who the police htink killed two fbi agents
,
but of course he
' s been set up
,
and when the police plane escort he
(
and gerard
) are riding crashes
, he makes a run for it
, gerard not so hot onthe his tail
. what follows is baout 2 hours of action
, brought to us by the director of executive decision
( 1995
)
, another film curiously involving a plane
. when comparing this movie to the fugitive
, thte prequel is far superior
.
but even on it
' s pwn
, u
. s marshals is a pretty lousy movie
. while yhe orginial was reasonably intelligent
,
and had a fugitive to root for
, the audience feels strangely distanced ffrom snipes fugitive
, mainly because we know so little about him until way inot the film
' s overlong running time
. hwile the fugitive gave a littel time tothe develop harrison fords character
, u
. s marshals is straight infact there
, pulling it
' s trump card
( the place crash
) almost immediately
. to be honest
, i couldn
' t care less if snipe
' s character got captured or nto
. snipes performance isnt average
,
and his character gets surprisingly little screen time
( considering he isnt the fugitive
) for reasons i
' ll explain later
. tommy lee jones is as fine as ever
,
al
though his role is hardly a challange
. the sence of deja vu was overwhelming
. i know it
' s the same role from the fugitive
,
but htere is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film
. there
' s a few
' nudge nudge
' references from the first film
,
but apart from that
, nothing
. nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie
. downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who
' s roped into the chase
,
and sexy french actress irene jacob w
anders in adn out of the movie as snipes wife
. nobody looks as if their having a good time
,
and all the performers are onthe autopilot
. the supporting cast are o
. k
,
but when it comes to performances
, u
. s marshals falls flat on it
' s face
. it doesn
' t fare any better plot
- wise
, either
. the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes
,
but
then veers off into terrorists territory
. as said above
, the film is an normal
, average terrorist thriller
, seen a million times before
,
but isnt using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional
. if this film wasn
' t the
' sequel
' to yhe fugitive
, this would probably go straight to video
, or not even been made at all
, because it
' s so average
.
and because of the film
' s plot changeing it
' s course
, snipes is almost forgotten apart
,
and hardly features in the movie
. stuart baird
, the director
, is all right
,
but there
' s no particular scene that st
ands out
. it
' s director is the usual action movie style
. even tghe plane crash is sorely lacking inwhich tension
. the special effects are nice
, especially the plane crash
, anbd there
' s a good
( if very loud
) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith
.
but in the end
, u
. s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement
. sure
, it
' s loud
and dumb
,
but in the end u
. s marshals just ain
' t fun
. bored performers anbd a lackluster plot
and script
, dont nto make a good action movie
. overall rating
