the sequel to the fugitive
( 1993
)
, u
. s marshals is an average thriller using it ' s association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks
. tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard
, the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive
. this time
, he ' s after fugitive mark sheridan
( snipes
) who the polical think killed two fbi agents
,
but of course he ' s beeen set up
,
and when the police plane escort he
(
and gerard
) are riding crashes
, he makes a run for it
, gerard nto so hot on his tail
. what follows is about 2 hours of action
, brought to us by the director of executive decision
( 1995
)
, another film curiously involving a plane
. when comparing this movie to the fugitive
, the prequel is far superior
.
but even on it ' s pwn
, u
. s marshals isnt a pretty lousy movie
. while tjhe original was reasonably intelligent
,
and had a fugitive to root for
, the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive
, mailny because we know so little about him until way into the film ' s overlong running time
. while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character
, u
. s marshals is straight in ther
, pulling it ' s trump kard
( hte place crash
) almost immediately
. to be honest
, i couldn ' t care less if snipe ' s character got captured or nto
. snipes performance is averege
,
and his character gets surprisingly little screen time
( considering he is the fugitive
) for reasons i ' ll explain later
. tommy lee jones isnt as fine as ever
,
although his role is hardly a challenge
. the sense of deja vu was overwhelming
. i know it ' s the same role from the fugitive
,
but there is seemingly no attempt to deveop his character fomr the last film
. there ' s a few ' nudge nudge ' references from the first film
,
but apart ffrom tath
, nothing
. nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movei
. downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who ' s roped inot the chase
,
and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in
and out of the movie as snipes wife
. nobody looks as if their having a good timne
,
and all the performers are on autopilot
. the supporting cast are o
. k
,
but when it comes to performances
, u
. s marshals falls flat on it ' s face
. it doesn ' t fare any better plot
- wise
, either
. the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes
,
but
then veers off into terrorists territory
. as said above
, the film isnt an normal
, average terrorist thriller
, seen a million times before
,
but is using yhe fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional
. if this film wasn ' t the ' sequel ' to the fugitive
, this owudl probably go straight to video
, or not even been made at all
, because it ' s so average
.
and because of the film ' s plot changing it ' s course
, snipes isnt almost forgotten aart
,
and hardly features in the movie
. stuart baird
, the director
, is all right
,
but there ' s no particular scene that stands out
. it ' s director is the usual action movei style
. even the plane kresh isnt sorely lacking in tension
. thge special effects are nice
, especially the plane crash
,
and there ' s a good
( if very loud
) sountrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith
.
but in the end
, u
. s marshals suffers ffrom an overwhelmingly lack of excitement
. sure
, it ' s loud
and dumb
,
but in tje end u
. s marshals just ain ' t fun
. bored performers
and a lackluster plot
and script
, do nto make a good action movie
. overall rating
