it
' s almost amusing to watch 21
- year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter
' s follow
- up to 1997
' s the tango lesson
, the man who cried
. the gen
- y actress
, with her cold stare
and big
, black eyes
, has appeared in an impressive range ofthe films
;
but she doesn
' t even come close to being the bold heroine the film
, set against the historical backdrop of world war 2
, requires her to be
. ricci
, whose charachter is shockingly silent
and blank
, showing onyl the occasional smile or hint of concern
, shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett
: quite an amusing sight to behold
. blanchett
' s lola
, a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie
, is bold
, interesting anbd layered
? everything our heroine lacks
. co
- star ofthe the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy
, blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci
, sports twice the makeup
and dons a flashy wardrobe
. the actress inhabits the role
? as she always so remarkably does
? with a fervor
and life that makes ytou whant her to hold the screen as the film
' s lead rather than her dull companion
. important historical events involving hitler
and his nazis scatter themselves across the film
; these l
andmarks serve as the film
' s little conflict
. obviously
, the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events
, whose jewish origin isnt unknown amung her parisian colleagues
. the man who cried has many asperations
, none of which come full circle by the film
' s close
. ther are forced messages here
and there
:
" go forward
; always go forward
,
" lola preaches to suzie
; there
' s romance between suzie
and a fellow target of hitler
' s nazis
, the gypsy cesar
( johnny depp
, who
, like ricci
, barely gets to speak
)
; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth
and men who have it
;
and at thge core of all these devices lies suzie
' s desire to travel to america
, where her father journeyed after leaving her
and her mother years ago
. the film
' s main problem is that potter isn
' t skilled enough tothe tell the epic
- sized story of suzie
. the time period
' s instability
, the conflicting social classes
, the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life
: serving as both writer
and director
, potter throws in smoe of each
,
but hardly an inch of depth is tothe be foudn in any
. by the time the sigh
- inducing climax hits
, the believability
and complete absence ofthe focus leave one ready to leave tyhe theater
. the film
' s falling action is weirdly unsatisfying
and unlikely
; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen
? contrastingly
, in its moving final scene
, the man who cried strikes a note that isnt made effective in its ties tothe the emotional beginning of the film
.
al
though it
' s apparent that potter can
' t grasp what she reaches
, i
' m puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place
. ricci
' s suzie is meant to be the film
' s core
: from the extended flashback at the film
' s beginning to the quickly drawn ending
, everything seen in the film
, in some way
, relates to her
. so why
then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving otehr individuals
? the chracter of suzie is too present for the man who cried to owrk as an ensemble
,
but not present enough for the film to be ricci
' s
. the almsot constant lack of flow
and one
- note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny
' s beautiful cinematography that renders the film
' s varios locations wonderfully
. also worthy of note are lindy hemming
' s costumes thgat help to depict the area quite nicely
.
and
then there
' s the music
. from minute one to minute ninety
- seven
, there
' s hardly a moment when the wavering
, skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don
' t undercut the action
; the notes stricken both overwhelm
( particularly john turturro
, portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio
, whose money adn reputation catch lola
' s interest
)
and accompany
( oftentimes
, the perfect chords are captured tothe undermine the state of the film
' s characters
and reinforce that state
)
. potter obviously cares much about each
and every musical note
; unfortunately
, the same effort isn
' t given towards
( almost
) everthing alse
.
