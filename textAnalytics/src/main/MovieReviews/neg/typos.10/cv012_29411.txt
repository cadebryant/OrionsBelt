and now the high
- flying hong kong sytle of filmmaking has made its way down to the classics
,
and it isn
' t pretty
. this time out the nod tothe asia goes by way of france in the excruciating bl
and
and lukewarm production of the musketeer
, a version of dumas
' s the three musketeers
. by bringing in popular asian actor
/ stunt coordinator xing xing xiong
-
- whose only prior american attempts at stunt choreography have beeen the laughable van damme vehicle double team
and the dennis rodman cinematic joke simon sez
-
- our musketeers are thrown into the air to do their fighting
. the end result is a tepid
and dull action
/ adventure rip
- off that stinks of indiana jones adn bad asian kung fu
. the stroy is so simple my gr
andmother could have adapted the screenplay
. d
' artagnan
( justin chambers
) is the vengeful son of a slain musketeer
. he travels to paris to join the royal musketeers
and find the man that killed his parents
. in paris
, he meets the cunning cardinal richelieu
( stephen rea
)
, who is trying to overthrow tghe king
,
and richelieu
' s man
- in
- black associate febre
( tim roth
)
, the killer of his folks
. he finds the musketeers in paris disb
anded
and drunk
, so he rounds up aramis
( nick moran
)
, athos
( jan gregor kremp
)
and porthos
( steven spiers
) to free the musketeer
' s wrongfully imprisoned leader treville from the king
' s prison
. d
' artagnan
and his new frisky love interest
/ chambermaid francesca
( mena suvari
) play footsy
and coo at each other as the cardinal hunts down the musketeers until finally the queen
( catherine deneuve
) ends up bieng captured by the menancing febre
, forcing the musketeers to regroup
, witht d
' artagnan leading the charge
,
and save the day
. director peter hyams
( end of days
) obviously wanted to blend eastern
and western filmmaking styles
,
but here it
' s a diaster
. one problem is that
, in reality
, most eastern films have taken theri lead from western ones
. jet li
' s high risk isnt a rip
- off of die hard
-
- not the other way around
. ironically
, there is awfully little swordplay or action in the film at all
-
- maybe ten minutes of swashbuckling spread over five scenes
. most asian action films cary the bulk of their production with 20
- to 30
- minute action sequences
, because they know tghe scenes have to carry the picture
. the musketeer instead weighs itself down with a predictable
and montanous screenplay by ginee quintano
( sudden death
)
, horrable acting by stephen rea
and tim roth
,
and the prosaic attempt of justin chambers
( tyhe wedding planner
) to deliver his mousy self as a leader
. chambers
' d
' artangnan isn
' t a musketeer
-
- he
' s a mouseketeer
! anbd hyam
' s use of c
andles
and torches to light the grime
and filth of 17th century paris are well
- noted
,
but that
' s the only st
andout in an overall flat prodcution
.
