" have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming
?
" obviously the producers at columbia tristar doed not think tath we suffered enough from the first installment
, annd so to finish us utterly
, they have now released
" urban legends
: fianl cut
"
. this is anyother
" scream
"
- like feature
, consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip
- offs from the most pointless movies of all time
. amy
( jennifer morrison
) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who dont not have a clue about what to do
.
but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university
' s film program
-
- where each year
' s best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize
, a virtual one
- way ticket to hollywood success
-
- she has a chance encounter with cumpus security guard reese
( loretta devine
)
, whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her h
and at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines
. soon enough
, fake
-
-
and real
-
- blood starts to flow
,
and amy is bieng chased around by scary killer
, hwile her cast
and crew get slain
, one by one
. is the culprit the original urban legends muderer
, just soem r
andom psycho
,
! a member of the faculty
, one of her competitors for the hitchcock
, or is there something even more stupid going on
? this is another oen of those tiring
, pointless teen slasher flicks
: neither scary
, funny
, or interesting
. it simply lacks the ability
and the story to entertain
. the body counts
and screams continue tothe grow
, as yhe weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly
. in fact watching films like that after having watched
" scary movie
" is impossible keeping a serious face
. several times i tried to prevent myself fomr laughing
, without succeeding
.
and
then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing
. it
' s the same thing that has beeen told
and told
and told over
and over agina as if it ws the revelation of the century
. how many times must we tolerate the same clich
? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth
? it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them
. they are the most stupid
, meaningless
, predicatble
and soulless films in existence
.
however
, directer john ottman manages to amking
" urban legends
: final cut
" into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre
. what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures
and irony in
" scream
"
, ottman tkaes seriously
. for that reason alone
, it is worth a look
, just to realize how bad a movie can be
. it
' s tough to find comparisons for such an achievement
,
and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect
. even movies like
" lost in space
"
and
" mission to mars
" seem spectacular inspite its shadow
. we have not seen such waste of t
! ime
and resources sicne
" showgirls
"
( 1995
)
. no matter how hard i tried tothe find positive elements in this so called production
, i came up iwth nothing
, except the way the killer was dressed
. here i fiel that i have to compliment thge costume designers trysha bakker
and marie
- sylvie deveu
, that have wisely replaced the well known scream
- mask with a very elegant fencing mask
. jennifer morrison
(
" stir of echoes
"
) is all right
,
and the other actors
' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words ffrom the script
. in fact the only thing tath is terrifying about this film
( with the exception of its screenplay
) is its portray of film schools
. if these graduates will be the directors of the future
,
then hollywood
' s golden dyas are over
. rumors are already spreading through tghe internet that columbia tristar is already developing a thrid installment
. let
' s just hope
and pray that it
' s just an urban legend
.
