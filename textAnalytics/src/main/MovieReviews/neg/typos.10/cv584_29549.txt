' s review of
" glitter
"
( 20th century
- fox
) there
' s less here than meets the eye
. or
, put it this way
, if you
thought madonna ws awful in
" shanghai suprise
,
" mariah carey
' s worse in this reworking of
" a star is born
.
" she plays billie frank who
, despite being abadoned by her singer
/ alcoholic mother
( valerie pettiford
)
, believes she
' s destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is
.
" you
' ve got this amazing gift
, anbd you gotta uise it
,
" her roommate says
.
" your voice
- it
' s incredible
,
" says another singer
.
" i ain
' t never met anyone like you
,
" proclaims julian
" dice
" black
( max beesley
)
, thte hot new york dj who becomes her svengali
- like producer
/ lover
. problem is
: her signature song
,
" i didn
' t mean to turn you on
" is wretched
. anbd wehn she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to
" exploit
" her by having her mear a bikini
, the audience bursts inot laughter
. exploit mariah carey
, who chooses tothe wear as little as thte law will allow
? come on
! writer kate lanier
' s script is fatuous
and director vondie curtis
- hall doesn
' t have a clue how to h
andle the glitzy pop diva
and
, as a result of thier incompetence
, whispery
- voice
' d ms
. carey seems tothe be embarassed onthe
- screen
. she almost cringes when the camera comes in for a close
- up
, pursing her lips
and averting her glassy eyes
. talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept
,
and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline
, there
' s an audible audience groan wehn the twin towers of the world trade center come inot view
. perhpas one ofthe teh reasons ms
. carey suffered her highly
- publicized nervous breakdown thsi summer is because she saw a preview of tihs clunker
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" glitter
" is a pathetic 1
. right now
, it
' s tops on my list of the worst of 2001
.
