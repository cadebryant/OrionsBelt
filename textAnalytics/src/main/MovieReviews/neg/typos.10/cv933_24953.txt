, thte sequel to mission impossible
, isnt a james bond wannabe film
,
but it fails to even come close to that film inthe wit
, humor
,
and entertainment value
. it tries to be a spy
/ romance movie
,
but without any suspense the film just looks like it
' s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses
. it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human
. the coolest thing about this movei
, was all the holes it had in its story
and the most trite thing about the movie
, was the useage of doves throughout as peace symbols
. the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violentce
. except for the choreographed action sequences
, the film was dull for three
- quarters of its time
, filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed
. as for the action scenes
, they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films
,
but thier advertisement fo sadistic responses
, is nothing short of mindless cartoon violentce
, whihc makes it very difficult tothe sit back
and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitious cruelty seen
. m
: i
- 2 opens annd closes with fast
- paced action scenes
,
but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags onthe inthe banal dialogue
. the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus
, at that point
. the only thing that kept me awake
, was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film
' s supposedly momentous action scenes
and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way
. it
' s a mega
- buck film adapted from a populer high
- tech gadgetry tv series
.
but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director annd actors to star inspite it
, annd it failed to produce a story that had any substance
. john woo
(
" broken arrow
"
/
" face
/ off
"
) is good at doing car chases
, choreographed fights with midair flips
and kung
- fu kicks
, slo
- mo shots of two guns blazing
,
and of fire explosions
,
but he just can
' t seem to h
andle dialogue
and suspense
. the star of the film
and co
- producer
, tom cruise
,
and his romantic interest
, th
andie newton
, are miscast
. cruise isnt no james bond
and looks more like a yuppie tahn a superhero in his stylish long hair
and innocuous smile
, as he tries to carry off tihs macho role
, hwile th
andie is not an action
- film girl
,
and seems like a fish
- out
- of
- water in this one
. their romance didn
' t work
, not only was it tepid
and not sexy
,
but it wasn
' t convincing
. the film opens with dizzying speed
, perhasp wiht the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success
. we will be in three different locations instantaneously
: sydney
, tyhe american southwest
, anbd seville
. first
, we are in sydney
, australia
, where a scientist with a muffled russian accent
, dr
. nekhorvich
( rade
)
, mentions tht he created a deadly killer virus called chimera
and an antidote for it
. he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain
. which explains the film
' s mythic theme
.
.
. as we enter the world of comic book myths on good
and evil
. the one who played the villain
, dougray scott
, does so in a one
- dimentional gruff tone
, which did not distingish him in that role
. at least
, if the film got the villain part right
, it might have had some fun whith this nonsense
. soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri
,
but
then the plane is tooked over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot
and crash it into thte rocky mountains
. before htey crash the plane
and parachute out ofthe it
, the one who was posing as dimitri
, turns out to be sean ambrose
( scott
)
, a rogue member of the imf
, which is a cia
- like clone
. he steals yhe package iwth the antidote
, peels off a latex mask
, which is a replica of the hero of the story
, ethan hunt
( cruise
)
, who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before
and had thereby gained his trust
. sean
and his gropu of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague onthe the world
and
then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices
. we already saw thte gimmick of peeling masks used in face
/ off
and inaddition the original mission impossible
, whic as convoluted a plot as that film had
, it was still a superior film to this sequal
. woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground
, as it is used so often infront this film by both sides
, so much so
, that it blurs any ethical carachter differences between good guy or villian
. it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character
, which distorts the reality of tjhe film
and mkaes it impossible for thte film to make much sense
. next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest
,
and ethan is on vacation
, hanging by his fingertips while climbing adn looking cool
, when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard
, delivers via a rocket launcher
, a pair of talking sunglasses
. hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package
and he is alowed to pick two regular imf agents to help
, billy baird
( john polson
)
and luther stickell
( ving rhames
)
, with luther running a high
- gadget computer
,
but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall
( th
andie
) to join his team
. he is told
, as an incentive to recruit her
, all her criminal charges will be dropped
. hopkins
then signs off with the tag line
: this message will self
- destruct in five seconds
. actually
, with the departure of hopkins
, it was this disposable film that actually self
- destructed at tihs point
. infront seville
, hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist
and a subsequent car chase
, where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road
. he allso falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal
,
and learns that she is valuable because her ex
- boyfriend wass sean ambrose
and that he still wants to f
* ck her
. the imf team
then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f
* ck him
, as she leads them to his hide
- outloud inwhich the seaside of australia inwhich which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort
, the south african
, hugh stamp
( richard roxburgh
)
. robert towne
, hte screenwriter
, who contri
buted to the first
" mission
,
" who is noted for doing
" chinatown
"
-
- writes a colorless
, pedestrian script
, one that fails even to be funny in a camp way
. the terrorists
, who aim to rule the world
, are interested in owning 51 percent inthe a biotech company
and in getting stock options
, as they plan to infect sydney with tjhe virus
and have their company sell the antidote
, insuring that they iwll make billions on the stock
. ethan comes to the rescue of the world
and ofthe nyah
, with his only conflict being who is more important to save first
. ethan does tihs rescue against all odds
, as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company
, fight it out with sean
and the other terrorists
,
and rescue nyah
, who injected herself with thge virus to hinder sean
' s getting it
, as tghe only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle
. ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding onthe a motorcycle
, using kick
- boxing
, winning a shootout
, throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists
, making some more use out of tht peeling mask bit
,
and by being completely fearless
and larger than life
, while he kick
' s everyone
' s ass
. if i was only entertained by this
.
.
. i could have lieved with it
.
but this film was so badly made
, that it ws like watching a highlight film of a basketball game
, seeing only the slam
- dunks
,
but with the gaem itself being excluded from the telecast
. in any case
, this is a critic
- proof film
,
and will in all probability do well iin the box office
, as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one eazy to buy into
.
