there
' s only one presidential election eveyr four years
,
but it seems like every few months we get another presidential conspiracy movie painted as
_ the
_ thriller of the eyar
. inwhich 1997
, we
' ve had absolute power
, air force one
, shadow conspiracy
and murder at 1600
. this oney is about as lame duck as old gerald ford
, trying to bring us a complex plot of cover
- uv
and intrigue
but copping out over
and over again with rehashes of action flick st
andbys
. here
' s what happens this time
. it
' s night at the white house
. a secretary isnt having sex with some unidentified guy with a cute
butt
. the next day she
' s dead
and hotshot detective wesley snipes is called in
. how do we know he
' s a hotshot
? we
' ve seen the traditionnal action flick opener
-
- the clever hostage negotiation scene
. it
' s nto so clever this time
, consisting of snipes disarming a suicidal ex
- government employee holding a gun to his head in the middle of the street
. snipes is off to the white house
, where he finds the secret service head
( the shiny bald head of daniel benzali
) won
' t cooperate with him at all
. in fatc
, if not for the intervention of national security adviser alan alda
, snipes wouldn
' t hvae been allowed in the white hous at all
. alda helps snipes out further
, assigning a sexy secret service agent
( diane lane
) to act as his liaison
.
.
. a very dangerous liaison
. well
, not really
, i just wanted to say that
. almost immediately
, a suspect is found
, an eccentric night janitor seen flirting with the deceased on one of the security videos
. snipes doesn
' t buy it
,
and launches into an independent investigation of his own
, one that reveals planted evidence
and romantic involvement by yhe president
' s son
. snipes
' partner
, an always
- wisecracking dennis miller
, calls him uv every once in awhile with more news
and lane
, who at first doesn
' t believe snipes
, eventually
and predictably comes arund
,
and risks her ass to break into social security storage
and break out some classified information
. for the first hour or so
, murder at 1600 looks like it could be going somewhere interesting
. sure
, we hvae to sit through the lame oppening sequence
and plenty more lame scenes after that
,
but the whole murder in the white house thing makes for an interesting premise tht is never quite delivered upon
. snipes
and lane don
' t make for a bad action team
,
but with nothing to work with
, they
' re just cogs in the bad movie machine
. dennis miller might as well not even be in the movie
; they waste his talents more in murder at 1600 than they doed in bordello of blood
, adn that
' s saying a lot
. when you get to tje last half
- hour
, the movei has descended metaphorically
and literally into a wet sewer
, busting out the old break
- inot
- hte
- building underground climax
.
and when htey finally reveal who killed the woman
and why
, you
' ll wish you never sat through this movie at all
. the
" 1600
" in the movie
' s title doesn
' t represent an adress
, it represents the number of satisfied customers worldwide
. serving the world for nearly 1
/ 25th of a century
