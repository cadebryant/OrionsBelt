my first exposure to the nightmare onthe elm street series of films was not thsi one
,
but in fact teh third installment
( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release
)
. i didn ' t see the first film until much later
. so looking back
, the original didn ' t hold a lot of great memories for me
, since i didn ' t think too much of it when i initially saw it
. watching it now for a second time confirmed tht it ' s an overrated horror film thgat ultimately makes no sense whatsoever
. you all know the story by now
: child murderer freddy krueger
( robert englund
) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before
. this first installment does an adeqaute job with it ' s low budget
,
but there ' s soem absurd dialogue
and conceptual problems with tje story
. plus thte movie ' s endig
( understandably the result ofthe the studio wanting the end of the film to have a
" hook
" for a sequel
) renders the rest of the film pointless
.
annd does anyone understand whta happens to nancy ' s mother at the end of this film
? don ' t get me wrong
though
.
.
. it ' s nto as if a newyorker generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics
. most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is
. horror is a difficult genre tothe pull off credibly
,
and a nightmare onthe elm street jsut doesn ' t cut it
. a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video
. it is available both as a single disc
and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set
. the film is presented in both pan
and scan
and it ' s orignal theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 78
: 1
(
although on the disc that comes in the box set
, only a widescreen transfer is provided
)
. the film has been digitally remastered
adn includes two options for audio
: a mono mix
and a new dolby digital 5
. 1 mix
. aslo included on the dvd is a full
- length audio commentary track with writer
/ director wes craven
, stars john saxon
and heather langenkamp
,
and the film ' s director of photography
. other extras include tghe
" jump to a nightmare
" feature
( i ' m sure you can figure that one out
)
, the usual cast
and crew bios
( which are from the film ' s orginal press release kit
,
and notably leave outloud robert englund
and johnny depp
!
)
,
and the film ' s original theatrical trailer
. some dvd
- rom features are also included
,
but since i don ' t have dvd
- rom capabilities i cin ' t really get into that
. thge commentary track is entertaining
and informative
,
but nothing spectauclar
. the first thing of note is that it ' s the same commentary track that was on the spacial edition laserdisc from a few years ago
. i ' m not saying that ' s a negative thign
, just pointing it out
. everyone seems enthusiastic about being there
, with the possible exception of john saxon
, who just doesn ' t say much at all
. most ofthe the time you ' ll forget he ' s even there
. everyone else talks really quietly
though for smoe reason
, as if because they ' re commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible
. the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 mintues worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series
. also included is the original theatrical trailer
and two alternate endings to the film
.
.
.
however you can only access one easily
. thte other is hidden in what ' s called
" the labyrinth
"
, wich might possibly be tjhe most annoying feature of a dvd ever created
. basically
, it ' s an interactive game of sorts where ytou wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give yuo access to extra little snippets of footage
, interviews
, etc
. somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film
. finding it
though is both a chore
and a bore
.
