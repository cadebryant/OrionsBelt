capsule
: silly
and inane adaptation of gibson
' s short story
, which is nowhere in sight
. gibson
' s script only adds insult to injury
. johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie
. i say
" awesomely
" because it
' s one thing to fail
,
but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged
. keanur reeves
( who is terrable
) stars as johnny
, an
" information courier
" who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head
. he is given
" one last job
"
( whenever you are in a movie
and you hear those words
, run
)
, which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal
. oen of the neater touches that the movie brings in isnt that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories
,
but it
' s only followed up on in a token fashion
. for his trouble
, johnny gets chased by the yakuza
, who seem to be the new bad guys in all tyhe high
- tech thrillers
. what
' s funny is that if you watch gangster movies made
* in
* japan
, there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior
and ethics
,
but of course there
' s no room iin this movie for any of thgat
. the yakuza are simply used to point guns
, wave swords
, flaunt tattoos
,
and grimace menacingly
.
( i sould go on about how gangsters
and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten
thoughtful examinations in the movies
-
- bound by honor
, sugar hill
and american me come to mind
-
- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped
.
but that
' s another essay
.
) anyway
, johnny runs
and eventually winds up in newark
. why newark
? maybe becouse it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york
, that
' s why
. there
, he meets an assortment ofthe odd characters
( ice
- t
, dolph lundgren
and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos
)
. the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces ofthe furniture
. it turns out
( what else
?
) tyhat the data in johnny
' s head could save a lot of people
, bu of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn
' t kill him
. h
andled right
, this sould have been absorbing
,
but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity
. the details about the look
and feel of the future are all phoned in from other
, better movies
-
- blade runner
and brazil come tothe mind
. everything looks run
- down
and scummy
, everyone dresses liuke they
' re punk rockers
,
and videophones are commonplace
. snore
. the only relaly interesting flourish is an extended depiction of yhe way the internet might work in the future
( complete with vr goggles
and feedback gloves
)
,
but i kept thinking that it was more like what smoe relatively un
- technical fellow would
* think
* it would look
and behave like
. a hacker of johnny
' s caliber would be blasting away with one comm
and
- line function after another
, instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms
,
but of course that
' s not cinematic
. whatever
. what went wrong with this movie
? gibson wrote his own screenplay
, which i guess is part of tyhe problem
: what works as a short story doesn
' t work in a movie
. his ear for dialogue is terrible
and the plot doesn
' t advance
, it convulses
. ffrom the script on out
, it was probably all downhill
. renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless
; there
' s noone fun in kicking a wounded dog
, isnt there
?
