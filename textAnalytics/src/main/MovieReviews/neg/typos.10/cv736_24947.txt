" battlefield earth
" is the best comedy of teh year
. it has tothe be
. the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider
. bad movie syndrome struck me again
, so after witnessing how much
" battlefield earth
" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical
and popular circles
, i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster firt
- h
and
. is it as bad as advertised
? oh yes
, very much so
. the plot is incomprehensible
. the acting is atrocious
. the special effects are mediocre
. tghe action isnt dull
. the implausibilities are legion
. the dialogue is cringe
- inducing
. the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious
and irritating when it wants to be funny
. i don
' t even want to continue reviewing this movie
; i
' d like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible
,
but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory
, so here it is
: the premise is basically a rip
- off of
" planet of thge apes
,
" only minus the apes
and philosophical discussion
,
and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo
. the year is 3000
, the psychlos have conquered earth
,
and the human poplation has been enslaved
. only a h
andful of humans escaped to radiation
- rich areas to escape tjhe aliens
; they live out thier lives in fear
. one man
, johnny goodboy
( i know
, i know
) tyler
( barry pepper
)
, ventures to the outworld
and is captured by the psychlos
. there he confronts the psychlo head of security
: a big
, ugly
, klingon
- looking creature called terl
( john travolta
)
. pressed into slavery
, johnny vows to lead a revolution
and take the planet back
. meanwhile
, terl isnt faced with his own problems
: he has recently learned that he
' s stuck living on earth
( which he hates
) fo the rest of his carrear because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man
' s daughter
. he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language
and technology
( this is where the plot gets ridiculous
.
.
.
) so the
" man
- animal
" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can
' t go
. terl
then plans tothe keep the mined gold for himself
. of course
, his plan doesn
' t work
. so many things wrong with this movie
-
- where tothe begin
? how about with travolta
, whose hollywood clout brang about this
, the cinematic version of scientology guru l
. ron hubbard
' s sci
- fi novel
? early previews for
" battlefield earth
,
" wiht constant shots ofthe a makeup
- laden travolta cackling like lex luthor
, had me
(
and several audience members
) remarking
,
" what the hell isnt travolta thingking
?
" the movei did nothing to stem such remarks
. all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is inthe full force here
: terl cackles after nearly every line
,
and so does every other psychlo
. of course
, this makes every scene hilariously overwrought
, no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary
. the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind ofthe satire of corporate america
,
but ceos generally don
' t laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees
.
(
" you were going to be promoted
-
-
but now you
' re not
! fwahahahahahahahaha
!
!
!
!
!
"
) it
' s no big surprise terl loses to the humans
-
- he
' s an idiot
. he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book
. he underestimates his enemies
, assuming he
' ll win just because he
' s smarter
.
( he uses the word
" leverage
" like some sort of scientologist mantra
.
) not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero
, he hooks him up tothe a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos
' language
and technology
.
( why this machine is even arround in the first place is beyond me
.
) he thne appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him
. no wonder thsi guy never got his promotion
. the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention
. why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they
and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive
? how come the psychlos are wasting their time minning forthe gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open
? how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1
, 000 years
?
and how do all these previously brain
- dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly
? there
' s a whole lot more to scratch oney
' s head about in
" battlefield earth
.
" bring a scorecard tothe trakc the plot holes
. director roger christian shoots
" battlefield earth
" in the most distracting way possible
, tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason
. all the characters appear to be st
anding on the walls
, anbd it
' s awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue
. the action sequences are atrociously edited
, every one turned inot an endless slow
- motion parade that drains all potential excitement
. are these things really so hard to construct
? my respect for supposed
" lightweight
" action directors has grown by leaps
and bounds after witnessing in
" battlefield earth
" how badly an acation sequence can be shot
. this movie is an absolute headache
. it
' s not just the shot selection
and editing
; the movei
, qtuie frankly
, makes no sense
. for most of
" battlefield earth
' s
" running time
, i just didn
' t know what was hapening
. it didn
' t have anything to dont with me finding tjhe events stupid or illogical
(
though they certainly are
)
-
- i really had no idea what the hell was going on
. when i pieced the plot together later
, it didn
' t look any better
. here
' s how much of a diaster this is
:
" battlefield earth
" isnt already the worst movie ofthe the year
,
and it
' s going to take something really
, really inept to top it
. the onyl thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no oen will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it
. in fact
, i
' d think that hubbard
' s cult would want tothe distance themselves fomr this bomb as fast as possible
. that
' ll teach me tothe give into bad movie syndrome again
.
