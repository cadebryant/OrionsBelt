jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons
, an embarrassingly bl
and acation comedy of mistaken identities
. chan plays separated

.
.
. aw
, forget the plot description
, it
' s not even worth the space
.
but let
' s face it
. no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway
. the scenes where nothing happens in chan
' s films have always been little moreso than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together
. inaddition teh case of twin dragons
,
however
, the tiresome plot
- driving scenes fritter away so much ofthe teh movie that you almsot want to shout
( at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema
)
,
" get tothe the good part already
!
" most of hte film is devoted to showing the brothers
' efforts to hide the other
' s existence from their own acquaintances
. why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained
,
but neither are a lot of aspects ofthe the plot
. the twins
' love interests
, demure club
- singer barbara
( chan
- film regular maggie cheung
)
and lusty bride
- hopeful tammy
( nina li chi
)
, get disoriented in all the brouhaha
,
yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with
. the scenes describing the boys
' bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is suppossed to be in any given shot
( inwhich several shots
, in fact
, even the make
- up
and hair people seem tothe forget which brother is which
.
)
. even chan
' s so
- corny
- it
' s
- funny humor is off
- kilter in this outing
. some of the gags are so carefully innocuous they
' re annoying
. a case in point
: whenever anyone sees the brothers toghether
, they fall tothe the ground in a dead faint
. are we laughing
yet
? as usual
, the final showdown is the film
' s jewel
, a tour de force display of chan
' s agility
and grace
. never mind tht it
' s not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash
- testing facility
. it
' s all good fun
,
but too little too lite
. perhaps chan
' s next movie should just be a collecton of the last fight sequences of all of his movies
. they could call it jackie chan
' s tyhe final fight scenes
, adn everybody would go home hapyp
