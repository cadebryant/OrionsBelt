jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory iwth twin dragons
, an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities
. chan plays seperated
- at
- births boomer
and john ma
, whose drastically different paths
.
.
. aw
, foreget the plot description
, it ' s not even worth the spoace
.
bu let ' s face it
. no one goes tothe jackie chan movies for the plot anyway
. the scenes where nothing happens in chan ' s films have always been littel moreso tahn glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together
. in yhe case of twin dragons
,
however
, the tiresome plot
- driving scenes fritter awya so much of the movie that you almost want to shout
( at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema
)
,
" get to the good part already
!
" most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers ' efforts to hide thte other ' s existence from their own acquaintances
. why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained
,
but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot
. the twins ' love interests
, demure club
- singer barbara
( chan
- film regular maggie cheung
)
and lusty bride
- hopeful tammy
( nina li chi
)
, get disoriented in all the brouhaha
,
yet strangely seem not tothe mind that tehy are not sure which brother they are in love with
. the scenes decribing the boys ' bumbling antics get stretched so thin we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot
( in several shots
, in fact
, even the make
- up
and hair people seem to forget which brother is which
.
)
. even chan ' s so
- corny
- it ' s
- funny humor is off
- kilter in thsi outing
. some of the gags are so carefully innocuous they ' re annoying
. a case in point
: whenever anyone sees tjhe brothers together
, they fall to thge ground in a dead faint
. are we laughing
yet
? as usual
, the final showdown isnt the film ' s jewel
, a tour de force display of chan ' s agility
and grace
. never mind that it ' s not clear how the brothers end up fighting suited bad guys inside an automobile crash
- testing facility
. it ' s all good fun
,
bu too little too late
. perhaps chan ' s enxt movie should just be a collection of the last fight sequences of all of his movies
. they could call it jackie chan ' s the final fight scenes
,
and everybody would go home happy
