that
' s exactly how long the movie felt to me
. there weren
' t even nine laughs in nine months
. it
' s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man
, mr
. hugh grant
, a huge dork
. it
' s not the hwole oral
- sex
/ prostitution thing
( referring to grant
, not me
) that bugs me
, it
' s the fact that grant is annoying
. not just adam s
andler
- annoying
, we
' re talking jim carrey
- annoying
. since when do eye flutters
and nervous smiles pass for acting
?
but
, on the other h
and
, usance wehn do really bad slapstick
( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant
' s head inaddition joan cusack
' s lap
-
- a scene he paid
$ 60 tothe have included in the movie
)
and obscene double entendres
( robin williams
, the obstetrician
, tells grant
' s pregnant girlfriend she has
" a big pussy
,
" referring ofthe course to tjhe size ofthe the cat hairs on her coat
,
but nontheless
, grant paid
$ 60 to have the exchange included in the movie
) pass for comedy
? nine monthes is a predictable cookie
- cutter movie withthe no originality in humer or plot
. hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist
. why a child psychologist
? so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange
: kid
: my dad
' s an asshole
. grant
( flutters eyelashes
, offers a nervous smile
,
then responds in his annoying english accent
and i
- think
- i
- actually
- have
- talent attitude
)
: could you possably elaborate on that
? kid
: my dad
' s a
_ huge
_ asshole
. mroe like a hugh asshole
,
but that
' s beside the point
, which is
: nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience hwile everyone alse shakes his or her head in disbelief
. so
, anyway
, grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant
and does his usual reaction
( fluttered eyelashes
, nervous smiles
)
. this paves yhe way for every possible pregnacy
/ child birth gag in the book
, especially sicne grant
' s equally annoying friend
' s wife is also pregnant
. the annoying friend is played by tom arnold
, who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick
, none of which is funny
, such as a scene where arnold beats uv a costumed
" arnie the dinosaur
"
( ytou draw your own parallels on that one
) in a toy store
. the only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum
, who shouldnt have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway
, as an artist with a fear of
( annd simultaneous longing for
) commitment
. not even robin williams
, who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch fomr veterinary medicine to obstetrics
, has much humor
. his is a one
- joke character
-
- the ood foreign
- guy
- who
- mispronounces
- english stereotype
( did someone sday yakov smirnov
? tht
' s my favorite vodka
, by the way
)
, hence the line
" nowe it
' s timne to tkae a look at your volvo
,
" another nasty
but unamusing joke
, except this one goes right over the ten year olds
' heads
, while the adults simultaneously groan
. nine monthes is a complete failure
, low on laughs
and intelligence
and high on loud
, unfunny slapstick
, failed jokes
and other uninspired lunacy
. hugh grant
' s sunset boulevard arrest
( please
, no caught
- with
- his
- pants
- down jokes
) may bring more people into the theaters
,
but they certainly won
' t leave with a smile on their faces
, not after 90 minutes of grant
' s nervous smiles
. everything in the movie is so forced
, so unau
thentic that anyone with an i
. q
. over 80
( sorry
, hugh
) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire
. bu at least they didn
' t spend 60 bucks for it
.
