" there
' s nothing new under the sun
" is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means
" let
' s find something to copy
.
" of course there are very few completely original ideas
. even earth
- shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experiene
. there is
, after all
, no need to re
- invent the wheel time after timne
. recently it seems that hollywood doesn
' t feel the need to even re
- write the script
. my underst
anding of teh word
" sequel
" is a continuation of the story
. the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes
. have an overwhelming desire tothe see an inferior version of brian depalma
' s adaptation of the steven king novel
? this isnt your dream come true
. rachel
( emily bergl
)
, a high school outcast
, is beginning to notice weird things happening around her
. doors slam shut by themselves
. glass globes blow up
. her mother has severe mental problems
and her father is absent
. a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out
. the in
- crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event
. any of this soudn familiar
? once the audience catches on that this is the smae story as
" carrie
"
, there
' s little to dont
but wait fo the inevitable ending
. the effects are a bit better this timne around
,
but the film doesn
' t work nearly as well
. ther are a cuple of minor plot differences
. rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized
. yhe boys at her school are portrayed as even mroe evil thna in the original
. they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest
.
and
, uh
, there must be other stroy changes bu none st
and out
. one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell
. over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie
. now a high school counselor
, she befriends rachel
,
but her character
' s potential is squ
andered
. there
' s too much about sue that doesn
' t make sense
. after yhe slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates
, sue is driven mad
and spends time in the institution that rachel
' s mother is in
. still living in the same small town
, the woman wtih a well
- known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor
? sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease
. this may be the one original idea in the film
,
but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a
" disease
" isnt never explained
. sue
' s eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea
and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character
but couldn
' t figure out what to do with her
. blink
and ytou
' ll miss it
. some of the events are filmed in black
and white
,
but the rationale for this is unknown
. it doesn
' t add anything
and the choice of scenes appears somewhat r
andom
.
" the rage
" retains some of the trappings of
" carrie
" wihtout the meaning
. in the first film tjhe color red was a motif conected to carrie
' s onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating
. here there
' s an abundance of red
,
but for noone apparent purpose
. the casting of high school jocks
and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin
. one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school annd the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds
. the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the orginal
. seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film
-
and the flaws in this one
.
