the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political
and or moral sensibilities
. the best tales of the genre deal with mankind
' s struggle for survival or knowledge
. such popular
and noteworthy tomes as
" stranger in a strange l
and
" by robert heinlein
,
" childhood
' s end
" by arthur c
. clarke
and
" man in the high castle
"
and
" do
androids dream of electric sheep
" by philip k
. dick all deal with man
' s need for identity adn struggle for self worth
. hollywood has reguarly adapted the milieu
( if not the message
) of science fiction since it
' s beginnings
. most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more
thought that the escapism they acheived
. it really wasn
' t until producer george pal
, took charge of robert heinlein
' s novel
" rocketship galileo
"
and crafted the film
" destination moon
"
, that
' sci
- fi
'
( as it is commonly referred to
)
, came into it
' s own
. from there
, such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick
, hve seeked to express ideas through the medium of the genre
. with the release ofthe touchstone pictures
" mission to mars
"
, we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci
- fi film for those who read the national enquirer
and the globe
. tjhe film opens on a summer barbecue
, as phil ohlmyer
( jerry o
' connell
) woos a young female witht his tales of space glory
and the upcoming mission
. woody blake
( tim robbins
)
and his wife terri
( connie nielsen
) commit to his comming authority onthe the mission
,
and luc goddard
( don cheadle
) consoles his son
. entering the party is jim mcconnell
( gary sinise
)
, who gave up comm
and of tjhe mission due tothe the untimely death of his wife
, maggie
( kim delaney
)
. luc consoles jim with woody
' s assistance
. the three men are friends
and carry a fine bond of trust annd careing between them
.
but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet
. tjhe mission is iin earnest as luc anbd his team l
and in the cydonia region of mars
. they send out yhe rover to investigate the area
and discover waht seems to be water or ice under the surface
. going out to investingate
, luc
and his team approach the famed
' face on mars
'
. a strange noise emanates from the rock
. as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar
, a violent wind storm erupts
, creating a vortex that kills all members of the team
, save for luc
. back onthe the space station orbiting earth
, woody
and jim receive the information that teh mars l
anding team is missing
. luc
' s interfearance laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to tjhe red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team
. the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger
. meteorite showers
, explosions
,
and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet
' s surfce
. the big question is
, is there now or has there ever beeen intelligent life on mars
.
and if so
, what isnt its relationship with us
? nowe for the bad news
. the entire plot of
" mission to mars
" is based almost wholeheartedly onthe outdated anbd preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe
. thte famed
' face on mars
' becomes the centerpiece of the film
, revealing some ofthe the most harebrained sci
- fi pabulum the screen has witnessed
. borrowing ideas from such films as
" robinson crusoe on mars
"
( 1964
)
, quatermass
and the pit
( 1967
)
,
" 2001
: a space odyssey
"
,
and even mario bava
' s
" planet of the vampires
"
(
' terrore nello spazio
'
)
( 1965
)
,
" mission to mars
" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don
' t add up to a satisfying wohle
. while some sequences are wonderfully h
andled
and executed
, the film remains flat
and un
- involving
. so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film
,
but to no ogod use
. the performances are all workmen like
, with only don cheadle
( as luc
) carrying any sort of real chemistry
. gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation
.
and the mistaken idea of having jerry o
' connell
( as phil ohlmyer
) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse
. anbd teh less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better
. he
' s just having too much fun here to give a damn
. the script has a few lapses
, namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite showfer
, no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage
. this of course leads tothe our heoes having to ab
andon their rescue ship
. also
, when oney chracter sacrifices himself
, the character takes on a religious demenor thgat is completely at odds with thte situation
.
but tghe biggest offence in tghe film is the horrid
, intrusive score by ennio morricone
. subtlety is non
- existent here
. in fact in soem scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out
. the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower
. the pacing of the film isnt very leisurely
. after the opening introduction of tyhe characters
( which lasts a full 22 minutes
)
, we are finaly dropped onto the martian surface
.
then
, there isnt another long pause in the plot for more character development
, including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity
. the film could lose about 30 minutes
and actulaly gain some momentum
. there are so many scenes of tlaking heads
, discusting what we already know is going to happen
, that it drags the film to a dead stop
. the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at
. the vistas of the planet mars are majestic
and awe inspiring
. the design of the numerous spacecraft
and suits are all expertly drafted
, withthe a level ofthe realism that hasn
' t been seen since
" 2001
: a space odyssey
"
. the visual effects are just stunning
, from the space walk sequences
, to the visualization of evolution onthe earth
. hte only fault come with the martians themselves
, whcih look more like something out of a plastic modle kat than something from another world
. director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film
. the oppening sequence alone in a seemingly un
- interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes
( an homage
' to hitchcock
' s
" rope
"
)
, as we are introduced to all of the characters
. scenes in the rescue ship
, with its rotating centrifuge
, are just amazing in theri execution
.
but the nagging question
, is tje final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang
. sadly it is nto
. directer brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production
. the setted design
and visual effects are all arresting
.
but it
' s the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous
,
thought provoking science fiction
. a disappointing film
,
but one that might still entertain if you cin settle for the visuals
.
