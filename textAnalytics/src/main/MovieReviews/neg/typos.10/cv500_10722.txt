you always have to be careful iwth the first official studio release out ofthe the gate each year
. they
' re obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes
( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility
and the big box
- office holiday season
)
. combine that with howie long
' s first starring action role
,
and you
' ve got a doozy of a movie that
, while not as bad as it could have been
, isn
' t a very good film
. howie stars as an ace smokejumper
( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground
)
. iin the slightly contrived opening scenes
, we witness his heroism in action
, as he
,
and his mentor
( played by scott glenn
) attempt to rescue a small girl
and her dog from an oncoming forest fire
. william forsythe plays thge bad guy
, a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak
. he
(
and five convict cohorts
) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodl
and blaze just happens to ignite nearby
. his excape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards
,
but
( since there must be a movie
) luck is with him
. soon the now
- escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters
. why canadian
? who knows
, eh
? along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher
( suzy amis
) to be their hostage
. enter howie long
. he
' s called in to help fight teh blaze
,
and when he spots the group ofthe
" ground pounders
"
, apparently lost
, he parachutes infront to halp
. when he discovers their true identity
, he is the only thing st
anding between them
and escape
,
and the only hope of help for the hostage
. long
' s acting talents are above those of
, say
, steven seagal
,
but not by much
.
al
though his delivery is mostly flat
and wooden
, he
' s a likeable hero
,
and there are some hints here
and there that he may get better
. the script doesn
' t help him out any
,
however
. all too oftenly
, it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny
. the dialogue is strictly b
- movei material
,
and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences tothe be believable
. long
' s co
- stars are a mixed bag
. at least they
' re all confortable in their respective roles
. forsythe has the scenery
- chewing villain down cold
, down cold
,
and scott glenn is always enjoyable tothe watch
, even when he doesn
' t seem to be stretching his talents
( as is definitely tghe case here
)
. suzy amis plays peril pretty well
,
but isn
' t given much more to do
. some ofthe the nature
and wildfire shots are interesting
,
but many are rather bl
and
. you
' d think that the director
, dean semler
, a former cinematographer
, would at least produce a film with interesting visuals
. that
' s not the case
. there
' s a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences
.
.
. we
' ve seen thsi stuf befoer
. it
' s nto the most auspicious start to 1998
,
but it could have been worse
( jstu think bcak to 1996
' s de
but
, bio
- dome
)
.
however
, after a month of oscar
- caliber pictures
, a movie like firestorm at least gives yuo some perspective on how good thsoe movies really were
. in fact
, there
' s a good chance that soem of them are still playing near you
.
