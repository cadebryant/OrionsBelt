you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out ofthe the gate each year
. tehy ' re obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes
( having missed both the deadline fo academy award eligibility
and the big box
- office holiday season
)
. combine that with howie long ' s first starring action role
,
and you ' ve got a doozy of a movie thta
, while not as bad as it could have been
, isn ' t a veyr good film
. howie stars as an ace smokejumper
( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground
)
. in the slightly contrived opening scenes
, we wittness his heroism in action
, as he
,
and his mentor
( played by scott glenn
) attept to rescure a small girl
and her dog from an oncoming forest fire
. william forsythe plays the bad guy
, a mass murderer who hasnt several million dollars tucked awya to help fund his jailbreak
. he
(
and five convict cohorts
) manages to git selected for firefighting duty wehn a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby
. his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards
,
bu
( since there must be a movei
) luck is with him
. soon thte now
- escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters
. why canadian
? who knows
, eh
? along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher
( suzy amis
) to be their hostage
. enter howie long
. he ' s called in to help fight the blaze
,
and when he spots the group of
" ground pounders
"
, apparently lost
, he parachutes in tothe help
. when he discovers their true identity
, he is the onyl thing standing between them
and escape
,
and the only hope ofthe help for the hostage
. long ' s acting talents are above thsoe of
, say
, steven seagal
,
but not by much
.
although his delivery isnt mostly flat
and wooden
, he ' s a likeable hero
,
and there are some hints here
and there that he may get better
. the script doesn ' t help him out any
,
however
. all too often
, it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny
. thge dialogue is strictly b
- movie material
,
and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable
. long ' s co
- stars are a mixed bag
. at least they ' re all comfortable in theri respective roles
. forsythe has the scenery
- chewing villain down cold
, down cold
,
and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch
, even when he doesn ' t seem to be stretching his talents
( as is definitely the case here
)
. suzy amis plays peril preety well
,
but isn ' t given much more tothe do
. some of the nature
and wildfire shots are interesting
,
but many are rather bland
. you ' d think that the director
, dean semler
, a former cinematographer
, would at least produce a film with interesting visuals
. tyhat ' s not the case
. there ' s a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences
.
.
. we ' ve seen this stuff before
. it ' s not the most auspicious strat to 1998
,
but it could have been worse
( just think back to 1996 ' s debut
, bio
- dome
)
.
however
, after a month ofthe oscar
- caliber pictures
, a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies relaly weere
. in fact
, htere ' s a good chance that some of them are still playing near you
.
