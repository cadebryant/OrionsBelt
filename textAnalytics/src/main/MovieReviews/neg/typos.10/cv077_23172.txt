ahh yes
. the teenage romance
. an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could onyl happen in the movies
,
and in the end
, the guy always gets the girl
.
and with the arrival of the breakout hit
` she
' s all that
' last year
( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including
` 10 things i hate about you
'
and
` drive me crazy
'
)
, the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity
. allong now comes
` down to you
'
. the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize onthe the rabid
` she
' s all that
' craze with their latest project
, which has the studdly freddie prinze jr
. attached
and all
. only
` down to you
' doesn
' t have the
? unlikely scenario
' mentioned above
. it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance
- a dull
, unattractive teen comedy that sticks tothe the boring gam plan that we
' re accustomed to
. this is the kind ofthe romance that only giggly 12
- yearm old girls iwll find convincing
. in strictly textbook fashion
, college sophomore
and aspiring chef al
( prinze jr
.
) meets freshman artist imogen
( julia stiles
)
. tehy hitted it off liek a couple can only in the movies
. from here
, it
' s the st
andard boy
- meets
- girl
, boy
- loses
- girl
, boy
- drinks
- entire
- bottle
- of
- shampoo
-
and
- may
- or
- may
- nto
- git
- girl
- back story
. the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main charachters
, who are frequently taking part in activities that
.
.
.
. well
, only happen in the movies
. fortunately
, the cast of
` down to yuo
' has a certain appeal
. freddie prinze jr
. adn julia stiles are an adorable couple
,
and wehn on screen together
, they radiate the sort ofthe warmth
and charisma that the movie should have centered around
. zak orth
, as the newly realized porn star monk
, shows an unmistakable flair with h
andling all of the film
' s intelligent dialogue
. rounding out the impressive ensemble ofthe young talent are shawn hatosy
(
` the faculty
'
)
, selma blair
(
` cruel intentions
'
)
and ashton kutcher
( tv
' s
` that 70
' s shows
'
)
. even the fonz himself
- henry winkler
, tyhe epitome of teenage angst
and nostalgia
- has a welcome role as al
' s dad
, thge host of the popular cooking program
` chef ray
'
. maybe the concept of
` down to you
' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd
. as a feature film
,
however
, the finished product is bl
and
and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep tje gears from stopping entirely
. perhaps worst of all
,
` down to ytou
' is not funny
. the jokes are drawn from obvious sources
and the resulting humor is banal
and uninspired
. the characters on screen
, often laughing at each other
' s goofy
/ embarrassing antics
, seemed far more amused than the audience
. even the giggly 12
- year old girls had grown restless towrad the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it
' s course
. the one mildly clever segment featured winkler anbd prinze jr
. in a fantasy sequence called
` cooks
'
, a
` cops
' take
- off in whcih the father
and son would storm houses
and cook a decent meel for
? needy
' families
( with the assisstance of a fully
- armed swat team
, ofthe course
)
. when this is thte highlight reel
, you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired
. in order to make a teen comedy work
, you
' ve got to have charachters that show something by way of depth
and identity
.
` 10 things i hate about you
' actually featured characters who weere more than walking flashcards
,
and the result was refreshing
. no such luck with
` down to you
'
. it
' s just a textbook romance where
, despite absurd circumstances
, everything is bound to work out in the end
.
and at the end of the whole clich
? d ordeal
, the nicest thing you could possibly say would be
`
.
.
.
. only in the movies
