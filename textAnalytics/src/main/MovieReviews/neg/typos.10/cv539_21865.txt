well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task
. he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films
. in a domain that he owns
, it is very surprising thast this goliath of an action star cxan not tell a good action script from a bad oen
. eraser
, back in 1996
, was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense
. batman
and robin
, in 1997
, was the black sheep of tjhe batman series with ridiculous acting
, idiotic acation scenes
,
and painfully flashy costumes
. now in 1999
,
" end ofthe days
"
( not
" the end of days
"
) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold
. isnt this the end of a powerful action star
' s long
- lived career
? will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable clasic like thsoe in the past
(
" terminator
"
,
" terminator 2
: judgement day
"
,
" predator
"
)
? or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past
(
" comm
ando
"
,
" red sonja
"
,
" true lies
"
)
? it doesn
' t look that way
.
" end of days
" begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably
, due to the formation ofthe the stars onthe that nght
, will be the carrier of satan
' s baby the hour before new year
' s ofthe 2000
. fortunately for the movie
' s sake
, the girl grows up
and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers
, subway trains in dark tunnels
,
and a myriad of inept nypd officers
. it
' s an action film
' s dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up
. imagine if the girl had lived in anytown
, usa
, where the only thing tothe destory is a dairy queen
and a post office
. arnold schwarzenegger
( jericho cane
)
, in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church
, who is trying to hide the girl
( or infact some cases trying to kill her
)
,
and satan
( gabriel byrne
) who is trying to make her pregnant
. if tje devil is successful
, the world will no longer exist as we know it
. jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1
) he once had faith
but no longer does
and 2
) his wife
and daughter were killed
and he fiels responsibile for it
. jericho cane is your cliched
, by
- the
- numbers hero right up to his name
. arnold fittingly plays thte carachter as cliched as he can
. he shouts at everyone
, from cops to priests
, to hte devil
. in one truly hilarious scene
, which ws supposed to be tyhe ultimate dramatic high point
, jericho screams to hte devil
;
" you are a

" those twpo lines marked the high points ofthe this film
. a movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor
.
" end of dyas
" fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne
. byrne
, playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil
, seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie
. he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time
. the annoying thing about his character
,
however
, is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face
,
yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho
. i cxan not count tyhe number of times he could ahve killed jericho
and taken the girl from his custody
. the otehr actors in the film give very weak
and unconvincing performances
. kevin pollak
, who plays the partner
and close friend of jericho
, is the supposedly funny character infront the film
( every action movie has one
)
. the one problem is that pollak doens not deliver noe funny line
. robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan
' s baby with extreme nnoyance
. she gets no simapthy ffrom any of the characters in the film
, except arnold who pretends she is his wief
and daughter
, or any of the viewers in the audiance
. inwhich one unneccesary scene
, tunney walks out of her room
and takes her top off
. is this her job in the film
? the actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible
. you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what iwll happen minutes before it does
. this little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movei
. in a lastest attempt to make this movie good
, special effects are used to try to entertain the audience
.
but wihtout a memorable action scene in the whole film
, the director has not done his job successfully
. this film would have gotten a c
+ if arnold stood in front of a camera
and shouted
" you are a
