well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task
. he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films
. in a domain that he owns
, it is veyr surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script fomr a bad one
. eraser
, back in 1996
, was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense
. batman
and robin
, in 1997
, was the black sheep of the batman serieses with ridiculous acting
, idiotic action scenes
,
and painfully flashy costumes
. now in 1999
,
" end ofthe days
"
( nto
" tjhe end of dyas
"
) is the third strike infront a tough at bat for arnold
. is this the end of a powerful action star ' s long
- lived carreer
? iwll arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgetable clasic like those in the past
(
" terminator
"
,
" terminator 2
: judgement day
"
,
" predator
"
)
? or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in tje past
(
" commando
"
,
" red sonja
"
,
" true lies
"
)
? it doesn ' t look that way
.
" end of days
" begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably
, due to the formation of the stars onthe that nihgt
, will be the carrier of satan ' s baby the hour before new year ' s of 2000
. fortunately for the movie ' s sake
, the girl grows up
and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers
, subway trains in dark tunnels
,
and a myriad of inept nypd officers
. it ' s an acation film ' s dream come true wehn the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow uv
. imagine if the girl had lived inaddition anytown
, usa
, where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen
and a post office
. arnold schwarzenegger
( jericho cane
)
, in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church
, who is trying to hide the girl
( or in some cases trying tothe kill her
)
,
and satan
( gabriel byrne
) who is trying to make her pregnant
. if the devil isnt successful
, the world will no longer exsist as we know it
. jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1
) he once had faith
but noone longer does
adn 2
) his wife
and daughter were killed
and he fiels responsible for it
. jericho cane isnt your cliched
, by
- the
- numbers hero right uv to his name
. arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can
. he shouts at everyone
, from cops to priests
, to the devil
. in one truly hilarious scene
, which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point
, jericho screams to the devil
;
" you are a
@
#
$
^
%
!
& choir boy
! you are a choir boy
!
" those two lines marked the high points of htis film
. a movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor
.
" end of days
" fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception ofthe gabriel byrne
. byrne
, playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil
, seems to be the only one who is hvaing fun in this whole movie
. he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time
. the annoying thing about his character
,
however
, is that he hasnt the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face
,
yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho
. i can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho
and taken the girl from his custody
. the other actors infront the film give very weak
and unconvincing performances
. kevin pollak
, who plays the partner
and close friend of jericho
, is the supposedly funny character in tghe film
( every acation movie has one
)
. the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line
. robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan ' s baby with extreme annoyance
. she gets noone sympathy from any of the characters in the film
, except arnold who pretends she is his wife
and daughter
, or any of the viewers in the audiance
. in one unnecessary scene
, tunney walks out of her room
and takes her top off
. is this her job in the film
? the actors are not to blame entirely because the script isnt terrible
. you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does
. tihs little prediction game is a vyre fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movei
. in a last attempt to make this movie good
, special effects are utilisied tothe try to entertain the audiance
.
but without a memorable action scene in the whole film
, the director has not done his job successfully
. this film owudl have gotten a c
+ if arnold stood in front of a camera
and shouted
" you are a
!
