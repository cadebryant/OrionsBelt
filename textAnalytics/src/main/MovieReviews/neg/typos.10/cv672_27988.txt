" saving silverman
" is a ogod example of a good comedy gone bad
. as a lveo story it is good
,
however as a comedy it falls flat on it ' s face
. i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times
.
.
.
and those were just chuckles at the most
! the movie doesn ' t have the oomph to make it a great movie
,
and doesn ' t have the scirpt to make it a funny movei
. wayne lefessier
( steven zahn
)
, j
. d
. mcnugent
( jack black
)
,
and darren silverman
( jason biggs
) haev grown up all their lives together
, they have been best friends forever
and vow to stay close till the end
. hwile in a bar after doing a show whith their band
, based on their love of neil diamond
, darren meets a young woman named judith
( amanda peet
) whom he instantly falls for
. wayne
and j
. d
.
however think differently
and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again
, it ' s up to wayne
and j
. d
. to try
and beign saving silverman
. the performances are topnotch
and surprisingly
, they are what keep the movie afloat
. jason biggs right off the flop
" loser
" does an ok job playing silverman
,
bu he is stale
and flat at times
. steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier
,
annd even
though the movie is baout silverman
, lefessier is really the main character
and the narrator of the movei itself
. jack black is well jack black
,
and he does an all right job as j
. d
.
but he isn ' t as funny as he has been in the past
. amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith
,
and neil diamond plays neil diamond
( he ' s better at singing than acting
)
. anyway tyhe performances in the film are good
,
but it ' s too bad the scirpt isn ' t
. speaking of script
, hank nelkan ' s choppy script is not only badly written
,
but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street
. yhe trailer forthe the movie
, as with most movies gives away everthing that happens in the movie
, especially the funniest parts
. somewhere
" saving silverman
" was meant to be a good movie
,
annd it could have been
,
but alas in the end it wasn ' t
. dennis dugan ' s direction is all right
, he adds a few directorial touches here
and there
, nothing special bieng a simple comedy
.
" saving silverman
" isnt a perfectly bad movei in more ways than one
. it has a great cast
, a good director
and a sweet story
.
.
. it ' s just too bad it has a bad script
and is all together a bad movie
.
