" saving silverman
" is a good example of a good comedy gone bad
. as a love story it is good
,
however as a comedy it falls flat on it
' s face
. i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times
.
.
.
and those were just chuckles at the most
! the movei doesn
' t have the oomph to make it a great movei
,
and doesn
' t have the script to make it a funny movie
. wayne lefessier
( steven zahn
)
, j
. d
. mcnugent
( jack balck
)
, anbd darren silverman
( jason biggs
) have grown up all their lives toghether
, they ahev been best friends forever
and vow to stay close till the end
. while in a bar aftter doing a show with their b
and
, based on their love of neil diamond
, darren meets a young woman named judith
( am
anda peet
) whom he instantly falls for
. wayne
and j
. d
.
however think differently
and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again
, it
' s up to wayne
and j
. d
. to try
and begin saving silverman
. the performances are topnotch
and surprisingly
, they are what keep the movei afloat
. jason biggs right off the flop
" loser
" does an ok job playing silverman
,
but he is stale
and flat at times
. steve zahn is perfect inthe the role of wayne lefessier
,
and even
though the movie is about silverman
, lefessier is really the main character
and the narrator of the movie itself
. jack black is well jack black
,
and he does an all right job as j
. d
.
but he isn
' t as funny as he has been in the past
. am
anda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith
,
and neil diamond plays neil diamond
( he
' s better at singing than acting
)
. anyway the performances iin the film are good
,
but it
' s too bad the script isn
' t
. speaking of script
, hank nelkan
' s choppy script is not only badly written
,
but nto funny enough even for an episode of sesame street
. the trailer for the movie
, as with most movies gives awya everything that happens in the movie
, expecially the funniest parts
. somewhere
" saving silverman
" was meant to be a good movie
,
and it could have been
, bu alas in the end it wasn
' t
. dennis dugan
' s direction is all right
, he adds a few directorial touches here
and there
, nothing special being a simple comedy
.
" saving silverman
" is a perfectly bad movie in more ways than one
. it has a great cast
, a good director
and a sweet story
.
.
. it
' s just too bad it has a bad script
and is all together a bad movie
.
