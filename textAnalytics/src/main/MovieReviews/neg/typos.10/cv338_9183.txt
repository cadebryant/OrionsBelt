wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions
. over black
and white drawings
, we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange
, sending the remnants ofthe humanity through generations of radiation
- induced mutation
. the
" original
" inhabitants of the earth
, fairies
and elves
, return tothe populate the globe
, along with their evil
, mutant counterparts
. one day
(
and i say
" one day
" not to be trite
,
but because that
' s exactly how it happened
- no advance notice
)
, a fairy queen gives birth to twins
, noe good
and one evil
. the twins grow up to be powerful wizards
, tyhe good one embracing magic
,
and teh bad one utilizing technology to attempt to exp
and his evil empire
. we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur bewteen the forces of magic
and those of technology
. as unoriginal as the premise is
, i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out
. there
' s a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world
, after all
. i soon learned
,
however
, thyat the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film
. once the transition was made from still art tothe colour animation
, an entirely different feel takes precedence
. rather than the epic saga promised by the narration
, we get a goofy
- looking world of a saturday morning ctaroon
. not just the look
, mind you
,
but all yhe zany sounds like
> honk boing for years
, blackwolf hasnt lost his battles against the magical forces of good
, since his armies of ogres adn other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined
.
however
, blackwolf now hasnt a secret weppon
: nazis
. yup
, adolf hitler
, the luftwaffe
and the wehrmacht
. okay
, not the real thigns
,
but an archival film his minions dug up
. projected into the sky for all tothe see
, it inspires his pwn army hwile shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up
. before you know it
, there are dead elves everywhere
. this is just as well
. the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn
' t care about any of them
. they
' re either silly
, sappy
, or both
. the dialouge gets much of the credit fo this
. an example is when avatar nonchalantly says
,
" well
, looks like my brother
and i beign our final battle
.
" nto very formidable when he
' s also the guy who says
,
" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i
' ve ever been on
.
" my favorite line was ffrom a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why ogod can
' t fight back against teh nazi
- charged evil
. her response isnt
,
" they have weapons
and technology
. we just have love
.
" suffice to say
, the characters are strictly two
- dimensional
,
and we therefore don
' t expect anything more than the obvious to happen
. which it does
. the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out
, which is anticlimactic
and disappointing
. please note thast it is the action that is unexpected
. that it is disappointing is not
. the film couldn
' t settle on a particular mood
. it seems to move fomr dark to light with the cuts from scene tothe scene
and even angle to angle
. scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity
. thge dramatics
, which seem to occur at r
andom
, are overly staged
and overly acted
, detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned
. ralph bakshi
, the director
, makes an obvious attempt to get a message accros in this film
: hitler
and the nazis were bad
. so who doesn
' t know this already
? well
, maybe children
. okay
, so yuo might say that this is a movie for children
. it
' s not
. in the scenes where good fights evil
, there
' s a lot of violentce
and gore that children should nto be seeing if tehy
' re watching a cartoon
. so is the film for adults
? if so
, we probably don
' t need to be bashed over the head to get the point
. why not have the bad guys be symbolical of the nazis instead of using old propog
anda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we alread know
? wizards gives us a lot of footage ofthe nazi tanks
and airplanes
,
and hitler giving speeches
. howver
, we don
' t see any reason why they shoudl be considered bad
. we see no attrocities bieng committed
, not even any real battle footage
. there is absolutly no connection made between the armies of evil
and the third reich
,
and we
' re not even given a cursory explanation as tothe why this stuff is inspiring in the firt palce
. this needed to be
thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made
, since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment
. i
' d like to assume thyat bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere
, at any time
, anbd we must therefore be vigilant
.
however
, i
' m not sure if i want to give him that much credit
.
