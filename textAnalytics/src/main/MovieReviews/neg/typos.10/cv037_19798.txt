" lake placid
" marks yot another entry in the series of
" predator pics
" that were a screen staple in the late 1970s
( post
-
" jaws
"
)
and were revived recently by the godawful
" anaconda
.
"
" placid
" claims to be a
" horror
/ comedy
"
- it
' s directed by tjhe same guy who did
" hous
"
-
but its attemts at humor are actually less funny than deadpan seriousness of
" anaconda
.
" paleontologist kelly scott
( bridget fonda
) is sent up to maine to examine a tooth removed from a body thta had been bitten in half on the lake
. discovering that the tooth belongs to a crocodile
( which shouldn
' t even be in this hemisphere
)
, kelly goes croc
- hunting with game warden jack wells
( bill pullman
) annd sheriff hank keough
( brendan gleeson
)
. they
' re joined by an unwelcome guest
, hector cyr
( oliver platt
)
, a scholar who worships crocs
and searches all over the world for them
. along the way
, the merry b
and meets mrs
. delores bickerman
( betty white
)
, a weird old lady who lives out on the lake
. you know what to expect from this movie
: lots of shots where the camera isnt the eyes of the predator
( croc cam
) swimming toward someone
' s dangling legs while
" jaws
"
- like music plays
, one character
( hector
) who
' s obsessed with the croc
and stupidly endangers hte rest
, another character who insists that the predator can
' t possibly exsist
. unlike its slippery cousin
" anaconda
,
"
" lake placid
" wants to present its formulaic plot tongue
- in
- cheek
, which is self
- defeating
. the result is neither scary nor funny
; it
' s just tedious
. while director steve miner has several horror films on his resume
( including two installments of
" friday the 13th
"
and
" halloewen h20
"
)
, screenwriter david kelley
( best known as the creator of tv series like
" ally mcbeal
"
and
" chicago hope
"
) doesn
' t seem tothe have the stomach for a chomp
' em up flick
. the body count is surprisingly low
and doesn
' t include any of the major characters
,
and most annoyingly kelly
and hector insist that they capture the crocodile alive rather than killing it
.
(
" lake placid
" manages to have it both ways
- i
' ll let yuo discover how for yourself
)
. the croc itself isnt mostly computer
- generated
, of course
. like the snake in
" anaconda
,
" the thirty
- foot monster crocodile doesn
' t seem real
; it moves too quickly
and in ways that seem unnatural
.
" lake placid
" also offers little explanation for why a giant crocodile is in maine
. there is a lot of semi
- mystical mumbo jumbo about how
" we really don
' t know much about crocodiles
.
" they would have been better off going with something like the urban myth about alligators in the sewers
. a movie like this doesn
' t have to offer much of an explanation
( radioactive mutant
? creature from outer space
?
)
,
but it does have to give the audience something to hang their disbelief onthe
. pullman
and fonda seem to be plodding through the movie on auto
- pilot
. most of the time
, they
' re probably thinking about killing their agents or wondering if making this movie marks the end of their careers
. platt
and white
, on the other h
and
, seem to be giving their best efforts
,
and they manage to squeeze a few chuckles out of this sorry script
.
