the premise of thte new james wong film
, final destination
, is that alex browning
, the protagonist
, prevents six of his friends fomr boarding a doomed airplane
, thereby cheating fate
.
however
, fate is not so easily bested
,
and alex
' s friends soon begin dying in unusual circumstances
. essentially
, this premise is a clever
- way to make a slasher
- flick without the slasher
. unfortunately
, this is practically the onyl clever thing about the film
. as far as teen horror flicks go
, final destination is better than many
. htere isnt enough shocking death
, graphic gore
,
and requisite black humor to provide the essential
" roller coaster
" type thrill at the heart of the average horror flick
. unfortunately
, this film also suffers from the worst characteristics of this genre
. the relationships between the main characters are tenuous
and their motivations are meaningless except as excuse to set
- uv the next death
. the scene where twpo of the characters break into a funeral home to view teh body of their recently killed friend is suppose to be scary
and dramtic
but features smoe of the dumbest dialogue i have witnessed
. if you are looking for a saterday night thriller tothe scare your date
, this film might do the trick
. other than that
, wait until it goes into heavy
- rotation on cable
.
