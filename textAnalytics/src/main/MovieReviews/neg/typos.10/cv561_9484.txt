i looked at the
" internet movie database
"
' s awards section for this film
,
and found thta this was nominated for a golden globe forthe
" best picture
( drama
)
.
" anyone who
' s seen this film can back me up on this
: this is the worst of the
" great
" disaster films
,
and that
' s not really saying a lot for this film
.
" earthquake
" is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured
. on video
, it
' s a bl
and
and slow
- moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters
( the disaster film requisite
)
,
then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster
. while this worked in
, say
,
" the towering inferno
,
" it doesn
' t here for one single reason
: we don
' t care baout any of the characters
. the film gives us charlton heston
( in one of many crap 70s films he made
, including
" skyjacked
"
and that classic
,
" soylent green
"
) as a rich man married to ava gardner
, who is having a littel affair with a young single mom
( genieveve bujold
)
; a renegade police officer on suspension
( george kennedy
, inaddition his least humored performance
)
; in the second weirdest subplot
, a motorcycle stuntman
( richard roundtree
, right after his
" shaft
" thing
) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track thta goes upside down
( yea
, snore
)
;
and the weirdest subplot
: a military man
/ bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal
,
and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair
(
!
!
!
)
. in smaller subplots
, there
' s a pointless bit about people who are flying over l
. a
.
( the city in tje film
, by the way
)
, one who
' s playing cards
and married to a boring non
- acting husb
and
( you think this one can go nowhere
? guess again
. he gets interested in thge fianl frames
)
; htere
' s genieveve bujold
' s moron son
, who has a little adventure with wires
;
and for some much
- needed comedy
, there
' s walter matthau
( billed as walter mutha
.
.
.
.
- the only laugh in the film
)
, as a wild drunkard
, who
' s big moment is a dance he does at a critical time
. as for the actual
" earthquake
,
" it
' s rather a let
- down
. there
' s a full hour of character
- setups
, none of which is interesting
, thn about 10 minutes of shaking
, crumbling
,
and a bit where a house almsot falls on bujold
( narrowly missing
)
. this film needed that whole theatre
- shaking
: they needed to wake everybody uv because they were so bored
. there
' s little suspense following the quake
,
al
though this film tries for it
. htere
' s an adventure iin a crumbling high
- rise office building
, the wires with the kid
,
and the movement of people who are all injured
.
but none of these are all
- too suspenseful
. the finale with the heston
/ gardner
/ bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip
- of
- the
- coin bit
, which brings out a big let
- down
.
and there
' s no rela finale
. even
" volcano
" ended nicely
,
and that movie really sucked
. nto only isnt it hokey
,
but you don
' t care about any charcter
. who cares if heston dies
? who cares if he choses bujold or gardner
(
al
though i owudl have chosen gardner
, mainly on the basis that she can actually act
)
? who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid
" stunt
?
" who cares if that idiat kid falls to his death onthe some wires
?
and who cares about that whole plane spiel
? if anything
,
" earthquake
" is worth a viewing for the same reason
" glen or glenda
?
" is
. i mean
, i laughed at this more than i did at
" bio dome
.
"
but that
' s another story
(
and review
)
. in short
,
" earthquake
" gives disaster pics a bad name
.
