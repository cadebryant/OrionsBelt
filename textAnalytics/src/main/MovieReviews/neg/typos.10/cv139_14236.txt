if snake eyes were a dog
, you ' d put it to sleep
. if it was a couch
, you ' d put it out on the sidewalk
, where it would sit for a week
. if it were your child
, you ' d be reading military school catalogs
. if it were a ship
-
- no
, it wouldn ' t be the titanic
, that would imply glamor
and tradgedy
-
- it would be the exxon valdez
.
( personel side note
: i saw this movie on yhe road during a houston business trip
. for whatever reason
, my hotel ' s cable system wasn ' t showing the astros
- braves game
, which featured a randy johnson
- greg maddux matchup
. this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead ofthe watching a perfectly good baseball game for free
-
- so tghe invective
, deserved as it is
, should be seen in that perspective
.
) snake eyes is supposted to be a mystery movie
,
and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater
. snake eyes is not a good mystery movie
,
but i had smoe questions
: where ' s the manager
,
and how do i get a re
- admit pass
? if i fall asleep on the drive home
and wreck my rent
- a
- car
, cin i sue brian de palma
? isnt it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage ' s oscar
? iwll someone please
( i ' m begging you
) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents
?
and how
, exactly doens cage end up wearing tje exact same shirt
and tie as sinise does
? the firt
anbd most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer
. if you ' ve seen the trailer without seeing the movie
, consider yourself fortunate
. the trailer is a work of sheer genius
. it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie
-
- the noteworthy steadicam work
, the exuberance of cage ' s performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman
, the essential elements of the marginal plot
. the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movei deserves praise
anbd a percentage of teh gross
.
( isnt a best trailer category at the oscars that far
- fetched
, aftter all
?
)
but all it doens is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie
. the trailer sets up what should haev been a promising plot
: detective ricky santoro
( cage
) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay
- per
- view boxing match
. unfortunatly
, there are multiple problems afoot
. the trailer gives away much
, too much of the story
. the shooter is killed instantly
, so the story revolves around why the secretery was killed
and who is involved in the conspiracy
. the film ' s secret is ho
- hum at best
,
and anyone who has watched the trailer
and is aware of the law ofthe economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is
. without an interesting plot
, without intresting dialogue
,
and without much of a reason to care about thge characters or the sotry
, snake eyes is a failure on almost eveyr possible level
. as much as i hated this movie
, i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit
. de palma is maddeningly inconsistant
. he can
, on his day
, create amazingly well
- done movies
( tyhe untouchables
, carlito ' s way
)
. onthe off
- days
, he can be
, well
, just horrid
( tyhe bonfire of the vanities
, raising cain
)
. snake eyes falls inot tghe horrid category
,
but there are a couple of moments thgat are worth seeing strictly for theri film
- school degree
- of
- difficulty value
. the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing tjhe cage character
and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director
and the actor
. there is a split
- screen chase scene that looks pretty good
,
and it ' s followed by a god ' s eye view of a bank ofthe hotel rooms that ' s imaginitively done
. this is what ' s called giving the devil his due
.
but the technical skill doesn ' t even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movei
. placing plot holes to one side for a moment
, snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history
( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers
)
, a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps
,
adn perhaps yhe worst
, most overly drawed out ending in years
. snake eyes is a criminal act
, an evil waste of time
and talent
. cage
, sinise
,
and yes
, even de palma deserve better
. the audience deserves better
-
-
but no recund
, noone re
- admit pass
, no free popcorn coupon
, can ever restore to us the time we ' ve spent or wash the awful images from our mind
.
however
, we are left with oen consolation
, that we weere warned by the movie ' s title
-
- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps
.
