if snake eyes were a dog
, you
' d put it to sleep
. if it was a couch
, ytou
' d put it out on the sidewalk
, where it would sit for a week
. if it were your child
, you
' d be reading military school catalogs
. if it were a ship
-
- no
, it wouldn
' t be the titanic
, that would imply glamor
and tragedy
-
- it woudl be the exxon valdez
.
( personel side note
: i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip
. for whatever reason
, my hotel
' s cable system wasn
' t showing the astros
- braves gae
, which featured a r
andy johnson
- greg maddux matchup
. this forced me to pay full price forthe snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game fo free
-
- so the invective
, deserved as it is
, should be seen in that perspective
.
) snake eyes isnt supposed to be a mystery movie
,
and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater
. snake eyes is not a ogod mystery movie
,
but i hadnt some questions
: where
' s the manager
,
and how do i get a re
- admit pass
? if i fall asleep on the drive home
and wreck my rent
- a
- car
, can i sue brian de palma
? is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage
' s oscar
? will someone please
( i
' m begging you
) give gary sinise a role worthy ofthe his talents
?
and how
, exactly does cage end uv wearing the exact same shirt
and tie as sinise does
? the first
and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is tje trailer
. if you
' ve seen the trailer without seeing the movie
, consider yourself fortunate
. the trailer is a work of sheer genius
. it manages to convey everything worthy of the movei
-
- the noteworthy steadicam work
, the exuberance of cage
' s peformance as a throughly corrupt atlantic city policeman
, the essential elements of the marginal plot
. the expert craftsman who pieced toghether a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise
and a percentage of the gross
.
( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far
- fetched
, after all
?
)
but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie
. the trailer sets uv what should have been a promising plot
: detective ricky santoro
( cage
) must solve the mystery of who shot the secratary of defense at an atlantic city pay
- per
- view boxing match
. unfortunately
, there are multiple problems afoot
. the trailer gives away much
, too much ofthe the story
. the shooter is killed instantly
, so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed
and who is involved in the conspiracy
. the film
' s secret is ho
- hum at best
, adn anyone who has watched tghe trailer
and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is
. without an interesting plot
, without interesting dialogue
,
and without much of a reason to care baout the characters or the story
, snake eyes is a failure on almost eveyr possible levle
. as much as i hated this movie
, i must give brian de palma one tiny bit ofthe credit
. de palma is maddeningly inconsistent
. he can
, on his day
, create amazingly well
- done movies
( thge untouchables
, carlito
' s way
)
. onthe off
- days
, he can be
, well
, just horrid
( teh bonfire ofthe the vanities
, raising cain
)
. snake eyes falls into the horrid category
,
but there are a couple of moments taht are worth seeing strictly for their film
- school degree
- of
- difficulty value
. the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character anbd is a virtuoso technical job by both tyhe director
and the actor
. there is a split
- screen chase scene that looks pretty good
,
and it
' s folowed by a god
' s eye veiw of a bank of hotel rooms that
' s imaginitively done
. tihs is what
' s called giving the devil his due
. bu the technical skill doesn
' t even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie
. placing plot holes to one side for a moment
, snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history
( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers
)
, a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate siginificant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps
,
and perhaps the worst
, most overly drawn out endig in yeras
. snake eyes is a criminal act
, an evil waste of tiem
and talent
. cage
, sinise
,
and yes
, even de palma deserve better
. the audiance deserves better
-
-
but no refund
, no re
- admit pass
, no free popcorn coupon
, cxan ever restore tothe us the time we
' ve spent or wash the awful images from our mind
.
however
, we are left wiht one consolation
, that we were warned by the movie
' s title
-
- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps
.
