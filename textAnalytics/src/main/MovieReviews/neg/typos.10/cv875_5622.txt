everything in the phantom you have seen many times before anbd there is nothing new presented here
. wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence
. billy zane is wooden as the hero
. kristy swanson is given very little to do
,
and does very little with it
. treat williams
, looking like rhett
butler
but sounding like mickey mouse
, is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie
. onyl catherine zeta jones
, as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance
. she has energy
and spunk
, which the movie needed much more of
. oh yeah
, the phantom also has a secret idenity
but this is so poorly palyed out you won
' t even care
. about the only things i can reccommend are a good performance by jones
,
and some colorful scenery
.
however
, if youre looking for a fun family movei
, go watch the underrated flipper
. this is not a good movie
.
