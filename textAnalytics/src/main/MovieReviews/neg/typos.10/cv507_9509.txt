midway through
" anaconda
"
, documentary filmmaker terri flores
( jennifer lopez
) turns to a co
- worker
and says
" i
thought this movie woudl be my firt big break
. instead
, it
' s turned into a disaster
.
" truer words have never been spoken
.
" anaconda
" is a monster movie with a lousy monster
. it
' s a suspense film that is utterly predictable
. it
' s a mess the film does manage to drum up some scares
,
but only in the most elementary way
, like a jack
- in
- yhe
- box
. as you turn the crank
, you
' re totally aware that the damn clown is going to pop up
, bu somehow it
' s still mildly startling when it happens
. the main difference beween tyhe giant snake in
" anaconda
"
and the clown iin a jack
- in
- the
- box is that the clown is more realsitic
.
" anaconda
" boasts some of the worst special effects to appear onscreen in years
. animatronic shots of the snake look as phony as any of those cringe
- inducing robots you
' ve endured at disney world
.
but it
' s the computer animated scenes that truly exp
and the meaning of the owrd lame
. in one shot
, a character tries to flee ffrom the monster by diving from a tree near a waterfall
,
but the giant snake springs out
and loops around its hapless victim in mid air
. the scene
, if done well
, would have been a jaw
- dropper
. here
, the horribly bad digital effects look less convincing than a saturday morning cartoon
. what
' s really amazing is that thge filmmaker
' s were so proud of this dreadful shooted that they actually included it in the promotional trailers for the movie
.
but enough about the phony snakes
. now it
' s time tothe talk about the lousy story
. heroic anbd very pale anthropologist eric stoltz leads a documentary film crew down a brazilian river in search ofthe the shirishama indians
, a legendary tribe that supposedly lives in tghe boondocks of the rain forest
. stoltz tells his crew
" pray that you didn
' t forget your bug spray
.
" apparently the female crew members bathed in the stuff
, because they spend most of the film wearing skimpy tops
and short shorts with no ill effect
. along the way
, the group rescues a whacked
- out lapsed priest
( jon voight
) who claims to know how tothe find the shirishama
. within minutes
, they throw away all their plans annd follow voight down a tri
butary inot the l
and of creepiness
. from that point on
, the film is a hodgepodge of scenes
and shots ripped off from
" jaws
"
and
" dead calm
.
" one of the oddest structual points of the film is the h
andling of eric stoltz
. early in yhe story
, his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect
and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious
. so why doed they hire an actor of the calaber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance
? also
, why did stoltz
, who generally selects his roles with grat care
, agree to appear in this crap
? ah
, the mysteries of hollywood
. the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to appen
. jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate yhe documentary
,
but lopez
and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters
. lopez
, who starred in
" selena
,
" is an enormously appealing performer
, possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible
. ice cube has a special charisma
; an ability to look like a macho adult
and a frightened boy simultaneously
. there
' s also a special twinkle in his eyes
, as if he
' s gently mocking his own tough
- guy posturing
.
but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight
. obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas
, voight plays the villain in thick accent
, with a serieses of leers
and hisses
, spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of
" jonny quest
.
" at one point
, he looms over the crew
and says
" the anaconda is the perfect killing machine
. it strikes
, wraps around you
, holds you tighter than your true love
.
and you git the privilege ofthe hearing your bones break befor tje power of its embrace causes your veins to explode
.
" that moment isnt so high
- camp that it almost made the film tolerable
. allmost
. fans of the horror genre may be tempted to check out
" anaconda
.
" don
' t
. there are a lots of horror films scheduled for release this summer
, including another
" alien
" sequel
. wait for them
, rent
" jaws
" in teh meantime
,
and don
' t throw away your mney
and time onthe drivel like tihs
.
