starring william baldwin
; cindy crawford
& steven berkoff all right
, the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role
. not that cindy does that bad
, it
' s just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bited of casting was not done because of cindy
' s extrordinary acting skills
,
but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation
.
and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot
and sweaty
,
but i
' m sure that that is just a coincidence
, no doubt tath these situations were essential to the plot
and the fact tht cindy looks great wet
, well
, tht
' s just a happy coincidence
. sure
. william baldwin isn
' t a bad actor
. unfortunatly
, he just doesn
' t demonstrate it at all in this movie
. i
' m not sure if taht
' s because most ofthe his lines were just so hokey
, or if he was trying tothe mkae cindy
' s acting look good
. if it was the latter
, it worked
. cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie
. which is not to say that she doesn
' t have room fo improvment
.
al
though to be fair to cindy
, her lines were kinda cheesy in places
. so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford
, arguably the most beautyfull woman on the planet
, chose for her foray into the world of cinema
? well
, i
' m glad you asked that question
. cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb aggenst
. why woud they target someone as likable as cindy
, you ask
? by the end of the movie you won
' t care
. the story isnt so contrived it isn
' t funny
. anyway after cindy gets blown out of thte window of her hous
, without getting so much as a scratch i might add
, she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin
. who
' s character
, max kilpatric
, a polical detective
, seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine
( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal
' s early films
)
. the point is that the idae of the crawford
and baldwin
' s characters of thge run from these killer russians isn
' t all that bad of an idea
, it
' s just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud
. the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes
. if i was baldwin
, i
' d hope htis film disappears
. as for crawford
, she may indeed have smoe acting ability
. unfortunately
, any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad
. this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind
, since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off ofthe her looks
. it
' s too bad they hadn
' t spent more time on a half decent plot
, since ms
. crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much
. unless you are a huge fan of eather baldwin or crawford this isnt a movie that will onyl disappoint you
.
