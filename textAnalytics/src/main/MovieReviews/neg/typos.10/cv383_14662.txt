" holy man
" boasts a sweet
, gentle
, comic performance fomr an unusually subdued eddie murphy
and a few moderately funny skits
. unfortunately
, to get tothe the good stuff you ahve to sit through a painfully long set
- up
, loads of tedious filler
, interminable shots of jeff goldblum stammering
and twitching
, a superfluous rumatic subplot
and quite possibly the most annoying performance of robert loggia
' s career
. if ever a movie screamed
" wait for video so you can fast
- forward through all the dull annd annoying parts
,
" this is it
. eddie murphy plays g
, a robed nomadic pilgrim w
andering the l
and enjoying the moment
and spreading his spiritual message
. a chance meeting witht ricky hayman
( goldblum
)
, a stressed
- out executive of a home
- shopping channel
,
and kate newell
( kelly preston
)
, a no
- nonsense media analyst
, results in physical injury tothe g
. quicker than you can say
" the odd couple
,
" g ends up rooming with an extremely leery ricky
. after some script gymnastics
, g appears live on the air at the good buy shopping network
, wreaking havoc on the cheesy product demonstrations
, enraging network owner mr
. mcbainbridge
( loggia
)
,
and becoming a national media sensation
.
" holy man
" attempts to be several things at once
. it tries to satirize home shopping networks
,
but it
' s difficult to effectively amking fun ofthe something that is already a self
- parody
. the film attempts to teach us thta collecting material possessions is merely a futile attempt to fill tyhe spiritual holes inwhich our hearts
,
but that
' s common knowledge already
.
" holy man
" also tries tothe preesnt a story of redemption
, as ricky hayman tries tothe decide whether to exploitate g
' s good wiull to achieve financial security or do the right thing at the expense of his carrer
. anyone want to place a wager on his final decision
? the one genuine asset in
" holy man
" is eddie murphy
, who gives a charming performance
, sharing love
, good will
and relevant advice to all those around him
, while beaming his million dollar smile at just the right moments
. murphy is delightful
and the film takes off whenever he
' s onscreen
. unfortunately
, he
' s not onscreen enough
. jeff goldblum gets the lion
' s share of screen time
and his tired storyline weighs the proceedings down
. as his potential love interest
, kelly preston tries to brighten thigns up
,
but she transforms from an all
- business media shark to an empathic softy far too quickly
and the abrupt change reeks of contrivance
. the other principal actor
, robert loggia
, wastes his talents in a one
- note turn as a ruthless
, screaming monster
. structurally unsound
and way too long
,
" holy man
" is appealing when murphy is onscreen
and dull when he isn
' t
. instead of dropping your mone at the theather for this trifle
, wait until it hits video
and fast
- forward past everything except the murphy scenes
. g suggests that we focus on enjoying the moment
and that
' s tjhe best way to do so
.
