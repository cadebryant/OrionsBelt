keep cool
, a chinese film directed by semi
- accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang
, was one of the kickoff films for this year
' s hawaii international film festival
. on the day it premiered
, lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block
, soem anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater
. they need not have wasted their time
. the movie is billed as a comedy
,
but is surprisingly bereft of humor
. there are noticeable attempts at laughs
,
but vyre few tries actually click
. i wondered if there were jokes thgat i wasn
' t getting because i
' m not from china
,
but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn
' t be attri
buted to the cultural barrier either
. keep cool just isn
' t very funny
. the prelude to the film ws a visit by keep cool
' s producer who
, with the help of an interpreter
, regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time
, an assistant h
and carried it on the plane from china to hawaii
.
al
though the print made it
, the assitant
' s luggage was lost
. too bad that story wasn
' t in the movie
, because it got a big laugh
. qu ying
, the film
' s female lead
, was also on h
and to give a few comments
.
however
, whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up tothe speed
, ms
. ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one
, fast
- paced
, incredibly long tirade
. it was dizzying
; good foreshadowing for the film
. you see
, keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera h
andheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes
. at least that
' s tjhe way it seems
, since teh camera isnt constantly moving
. cinema verite is one thing
,
but panning adn shaking around until your audience hasnt a headache is another
.
al
thought some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chineese youth is slowly growing
, i found it thoroughly distracting
,
and after a while
, quite annoying
. headache
, as i said
. the film is about a young bookseller
( wen jiang
) who is affter a young woman
( qu ying
)
. they used tothe be romantically involved
,
but the woman grew tired ofthe him
and left the relationship
. the first half of tghe film isnt about the young man
' s plan to win her back
. of course the thing isnt
, she doesn
' t want to be won bcak
,
and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit
. in the fight
, the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a byst
ander
and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker
,
but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost
. we later fidn out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced
. there is a funny scene
( the only one in the film
) where yhe young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man tothe seek out the nightclub owner
( baotian li
) inwhich order to recoup his losses
. there is no sense to be made out of the young woman
' s behavour
; cold one minute
, caring the next
, so we feel no simapthy for her character
. the bookseller would be better off without her
.
al
though the second half of tyhe film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well
, who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner
' s h
and as revenge for the beating he took
, it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller
and the older man
. while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge
, the older man is the voice of reason
and tries to rationalize each situation
. his quest to end the dispute peacefully
and equitably is the one we identify with
,
but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time
. a friendship develops between the two men
,
but it occurs too lite in the film for the audience to appreciate
.
al
though only an hour
and a half in length
, keep cool contains extraneous material
. the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could hve been taken out
, since we don
' t see her from tghe midpoint on
. a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller
and the nightclub owner
,
and would have saved us from the bookseller
' s boring pursuit during the first half
.
but of course
, this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour
. there are a few things that keep cool does right
. as mentioned before
, the interaction between the bookseller adn the older man is generally pretty good
. altho it grows tiresome
, the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic
,
and represents the differences in thinking bewteen generations
. in one scene
, for example
, the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across
,
but the older man claims the qoute was misinterpreted
,
and that it means something entirely different
. also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene
, such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the h
and of the unwitting nightclub owner
. the nightclub owner isnt counting out money
, slapping each bundle of currency on the table
. wiht every shot of his h
and
, we can hardly st
and the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver
and exact his revenge
. unfortunately
, these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film
' s shortcomings
,
and weren
' t enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater
.
