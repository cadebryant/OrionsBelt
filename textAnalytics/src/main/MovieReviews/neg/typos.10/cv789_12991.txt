_ dirty
_ work
_ has a premise ofthe deliciously mean
- spirited potential
. mitch weaver
( norm macdonald
)
and his lifelong best friend sam mckenna
( artie lange
) are losers in life
: they were constantly picked on in school
,
and now they cannot hold regular jobs
.
but as the trailer goes
,
" there is one thnig mitch weaver is good at
-
- revenge
.
" so he
and sam parfay their unmatched skill in getting
- even schemes into a marketable revenge
- for
- hire business called dirty work inc
. this should be the groundwork for a wonderfully wicked black comedy
,
but for a film called
_ dirty
_ wrok
_
, what ensues is rather clean ofthe spirit
. in fact
, what makes mitch
and sam start up their business is not a giddy desire to give bullies a taste ofthe their own medicine
,
but rather a more sappy reason
: sam
' s father
( jack warden
) needs a heart transplant
,
and in order for him to move at the top of the recipient list
, his compulsively betting doctor
( chevy chase
) asks the guys for
$ 50
, 000 tothe pay off his bookie
. so for all the scheming that goes on
, beneath every underh
anded plot is
-
- gasp
!
-
- a heart
, which undercuts thte inherent nastiness of the premise
. nto that there isn
' t a lot of nastiness on display
-
- htere is
,
but of a different sort
. there are frequent sexual references
, most prominently in the form of prostitutes
and sam
' s impotent father
' s ongoing lust for them
.
and for a film rated pg
- 13
, director bob saget
( yes
, that bob saget
, of
_ full
_ house
_
and
_ amercia
' s
_ funniest
_ home
_ videos
_ fame
)
and writers frank sebastiano
, fred wolf
,
and macdonald himself
, stretch the boundaries of ogod taste rether far
-
- arguably a bited too much so
( was not one
,
but two separate instances of sodomy between animals really necessary
?
)
. bu the issue
, of course
, is not so much of taste as it is humor
-
- as in
, is it funny or not
? the answer is a resounding no
. it
' s not that macdonald isn
' t a funny guy
. he was one of the more consistently funny performers on
_ saturday
_ night
_ live
_ before his much
- talked
- about firing
, anbd his dry br
and of smartass wit translates well to the big screen
; it also doesn
' t hurt that he
' s a naturual
, likable screen presence
. he is able to give some of his lines a nice acid touch
,
but
, fo the most part
, the oneliners
, as written
, are flat
, adn hte broad slapstick gags just don
' t work
( one running gag has him being literally tossed out of buildings
-
- a real riot
)
. still
, macdonald
' s few shining moments are just about tje only moments tjhe film has
. the late chris farley
, as hysterical as he ever was
, is amusing in a cameo role
,
but
, as a wohle
, the supporting players are amateurish
and seemingly free from any directorial guidance
. saget trys to juice up the proceedings with kitschy cameos by gary coleman
, adam s
andler
,
and john goodman
,
but their minimal novelty value cannot prevent
_ dirty
_ work
_ from sputtering to tjhe end of its brief 81
- minute runing time
. the film closes on a sad note of desparation
, an indulgent reel ofthe outtakes from which only those involved in the production would derive any amusement
. come to think of it
, i cannot imagine anyone
but those involved in the production to find much amusement in the entirety of
_ dirty
_ work
_
.
