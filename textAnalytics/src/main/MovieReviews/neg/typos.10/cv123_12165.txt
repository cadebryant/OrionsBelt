you don
' t need to have seen the original
" species
" to appreciate how utterly lousy
" species ii
" is
. with few exceptions
, sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them
,
but the fatc that
" species ii
" is a follow
- up isn
' t the only reason it
' s so miserable
. it
' s yhe predictable storyline
, the cardboard cahracters
, the banal dialogue
, the failed attempts at humer
, the revolting special effects
, the gratuitous nudity
( all female
, of course
)
, the bad acting
,
and the bl
and direction
. the plot
, simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc
, involves three astronauts l
anding onthe mars
and inadvertantly bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle
. the slime
, well
, sort of jumps out at them anbd the screen turns black
. that should have been the end of the movie right there
. back onthe terra firma
, at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna
and
, as you
' ll remember if you saw tjhe first movie
, driven by a strong urge to procreate
. on a parallel track
, government scientists have cloned a version ofthe sil from the first film
( now called eve
, again
" played
" by natasha henstridge
)
and are keeping her around for some testing
. this
, apparently
, includes observing eve
' s reaction to
" the dukes of hazzard
" tv show
, which she appears to enjoy
. eve
' s bio
- rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk
" mates
,
" which we are forced to witness in gross
- out detail
,
but otherwise there doesn
' t appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film
, unless it was written into her contract
( let
' s hope it cited one sequel anbd oney sequel only
)
. eve finally breaks free of her confines
-
-
and her bra
-
- for the finale
,
but the effects are so messy ytou can
' t really see what
' s going on
. peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams
" i told
' em not to go
!
" at tje top of his lungs
, referring to the mars mission bu more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle
. michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox
( so that he cant enter high security areas
, flash a badge annd claim to be press
, maybe
?
)
, as does marg helgenberger as dr
. laura baker
, the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns
. they
' re both unbelievably wooden
. wqat
' s a talented filmmaker like peter medak
(
" the ruling class
,
"
" the krays
,
"
" let him have it
"
) doing directing this tripe
, i wonder
. it
' s an unfortunate trend
, this
: once
- talented directors throwing in the towel
and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks liuke
" species ii
.
" last year peter hyams gave us
" the relic
"
; no thanks necessary there
. anbd the first
" species
" was helmed by roger donaldson who
, altho certainly no genuis behind the camera
, had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects
. is it just that there are no better offers out there
?
" species ii
" is worthless
. worse than thast
, it
' s also exploitative
, offensive
, annd insulting tothe the inelligence at every turn
. it
' s nto that there isn
' t anything positive to say about the film
. there is
. after 92 minutes
, it ends
.
