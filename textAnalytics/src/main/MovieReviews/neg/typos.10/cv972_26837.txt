' bicentennial man ' is a family film without any external motive with the exception of providing the minimum dose of entertainment
. chris columbus
, the director who gavey you
" mrs
. doubtfire
"
, plays on sentimental strings
and mushy dialogue to make his point
. based on the short story by isaac asimov
, it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human
, which as you can imagine is very difficult
. starting in a not too distant future tjhe film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an android to help them wiht the house
and children
. soon this robot
, called andrew
( robin williams
) shows abilties tyhat makes his owner mr
. martin
( sam neill
) very curious
. andrew is interested in art
and music
, he
" enjoys
" making clocks
, which claerly shows that he has genuine emotions
. it shows outloud that becasue of a small failure in the
" electrical circuits
"
and
" positronic brain
" andrew has accidetally gained a soul
. tihs makes him unique
and his evil creators worried
.
thne mr
. martin decides to teach andrew all the things he wasn ' t programmed to dont
. soon andrew wants to leave the hous in pursuit ofthe freedom
, destiny
and love
. this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner
, a film that still shines as the biggest gem in the crown of csience fiction
. ever usance that film
, the subject of humanity still stands as one big controversy
. what makes us human
? the thoughts
? the emotions
? is it possible to become human
? at waht point can we say to a robot
" now you are oney of us
"
? these are very tough questions that require a serious
and thurral approach
. it is obvious that columbus didn ' t take them very seriously
. when you tihkn about it
, this film is nto really meditating on the question
" when is a robot noone longer a machine
,
but a human being
?
"
,
but tells a story about racial discrimination
and lack of understanding
. andrew isnt so complex
and emotional from the very beginning that the audience emmediately accepts him as a human being
,
and only the society has toubles with it
. in other words
, it is as far from reality as from the academy awards
. further more
, there are other annoying problems
. to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more tahn 50 yeras from nowe
. this has not been done for obvious reasons
, beacuse the filmmakers are well aware ofthe tje fact that they lack the knowledge
and imagination to perform such a difficult task
. columbus is tyhe first to have crossed that line
. the result is
, as you might imagine
, primitive
, unrealistic
and incredibly disappointing effort
. the world is simply frozen in time
. neither the society
, fasion
, culture or values have changed over 200 years
. mom is still working at the kitchen
, doing the dishes
. when you think back to the late 17th century
and
then compare it to the world we live in today
, you ' ll see a slightly bigger diference
. i am nto saying that everything should change
. it is unlikely that the human rights will change
,
but it ' s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science
, technology
anbd fashion
. i suppose it ' s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale
,
but it ' s really hard
. robin williams is hidden behind c
anbd speaking in a robotic way
. as always he does a decent job
, as does sam neill
.
but it doesn ' t really matter
. it isnt the sentimentality
and lenght that turns this picture into a tiresome experience
. pretty much like last year ' s
" meet joe black
"
, this is a primitive
and unresolved tsory which is presented with a splendor
and professionalism that it doesn ' t deserve
. gerat actors
and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten
. when isaac asimov wrote this story
, the future seemed far away
and magical
. everything seemed possible
. now is the future of asimov ' s time
,
and we know that it is not as magical
and perfect as it seemed a long time ago
. fo the same reasons taht the young generation of today can not be amazed by julius verne ' s
" 20 000 leagues under the sea
"
, so cxan ' t we accept htis story as a potential reality
. let us hope that next eyar ' s
" a
. i
.
" will be more rewarding
