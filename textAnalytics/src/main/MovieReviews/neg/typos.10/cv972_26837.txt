' bicentennial man
' is a family film without any external motive with the exception ofthe providing the minimum dose of entertainment
. chris columbus
, the directer who gave you
" mrs
. doubtfire
"
, plays on sentimental strings
and mushy dialogue to make his point
. based on the short story by isaac asimov
, it is supposed to be a science fiction story about a robot who wants to be human
, which as you can imagine is very difficult
. starting in a nto too distant future thge film concentrates on a wealthy family that buys an
android to halp them with the house
and children
. soon this robot
, called
andrew
( robin williams
) shows abilties that makes his owner mr
. martin
( sam neill
) very curious
.
andrew isnt interested in art
and music
, he
" enjoys
" makeing clocks
, which clearly shows that he has genuine emotions
. it shows out that because ofthe a small failure in teh
" electrical circuits
"
and
" positronic brain
"
andrew has accidentally gained a soul
. this makes him unique
and his evil creators worried
. thne mr
. martin decides to teach
andrew all the things he wasn
' t programmed to do
. soon
andrew wants tothe leave the hous in persuit of freedom
, destiny
and love
. this film can be described as a disney version of blade runner
, a film that still shines as yhe biggest gem in the crown of science fiction
. ever since that film
, the subject of humanity still st
ands as one big controversy
. what makes us human
? the
thoughts
? the emotions
? is it possible to become human
? at what point can we say tothe a robot
" now you are one of us
"
? these are very tough questions that require a sereous anbd thurral approach
. it is obvious that columbus didn
' t take them very seriously
. when you think baout it
, this film isnt not really meditating on the question
" when is a robot no longer a machine
,
but a human being
?
"
,
but tells a story about racial discrimination
and lack of underst
anding
.
andrew is so complex
and emotional from the very beginning that the audience immediately accepts him as a human being
,
and only the society has troubles with it
. in other words
, it is as far from reality as from the academy awards
. further more
, there are other annoying problems
. to this day no serious filmmaker has dared to speculate about the future in more than 50 years from now
. this has not been done for obvious reasons
, because the filmmakers are well aware of the fact that tehy lack tjhe knowledge
and imagination to perform such a difficult task
. columbus is the frist to have crossed that line
. the result is
, as you might imagine
, primitive
, unrealistic
and incredibly disappointing effort
. hte world is simpley frozen in time
. neither the society
, fashion
, culture or values have changed over 200 years
. mom is still working at the kitchen
, doing the dishes
. when you think back to the lite 17th centruy
and thne compare it to the world we live in todya
, you
' ll see a slightly bigger difference
. i am not saying that everything should change
. it is unlikely that the human rights will change
,
but it
' s even more unlikely that there will not be any progress in science
, technology
and fashion
. i supose it
' s possible to watch this as a some sort of bizarre fairytale
,
but it
' s really hard
. robin williams isnt hidden behind c
and speaking in a robotic way
. as always he doens a decent job
, as does sam neill
.
but it doesn
' t really matter
. it is the sentimentality
and length that turns tihs picture into a tiresome experience
. pretty much like last year
' s
" meet joe black
"
, htis is a primitive
and unresolved story which is presented with a splendor
and professionalism that it doesn
' t deserve
. great actors
and a talented crew have worked hard to achieve something that will be instantly forgotten
. when isaac asimov wrote this story
, thte future seemed far away
and magical
. everything seemed possible
. now is the future of asimov
' s time
,
and we know that it is not as magical
and perfect as it seemed a long time ago
. for the same reasons that the young generation ofthe todya can not be amazed by julius verne
' s
" 20 000 leagues under the sea
"
, so can
' t we accept this story as a potential reality
. let us hope that next year
' s
" a
. i
.
" will be more rewarding
.
