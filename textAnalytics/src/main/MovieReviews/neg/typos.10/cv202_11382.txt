jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today
. from time
- to
- time
, she blows away audiences with powerful
, intense performances
. on the otehr h
and
, this is the same woman who made her jaw
- droppingly awful feature de
but in dino delaurentiis
' king kong
.
and
, much as lange would propably prefer movie
- goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry onthe her resume
, every once in a while she does work that isnt reminiscent of it
, if only in quality
. hush is one such example
. lange isnt so bad here that she might have beeen fun to watch if the rest ofthe the film wasn
' t such a prime example of motion picture tedium
. the film opens
, as many so
- called
" psychological thrillers
" do
, by posing as a light drama
. we are introduced to jackson
( johnathon schaech
, last encounter in tom hanks
' that thing you dont
!
)
and helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, a picture perfect young cuple who are very much in loev
. jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother
, martha
( lange
)
. the moment i first saw martha
, i started looking for fangs
. soon
, the wicked witch of the east isnt plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant
( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm
)
. once that goal is accomplished
, she manipulates events so that the expecting cuple moves out of new york city to tyhe horse farm where she lives
. as long as she gets her way
, martha is a perfectly amicable person
,
but whn helen defies her
, it
' s a declaration of war
. hush has three very simple problems
: it
' s incredibly dumb
, it
' s incredibly boring
,
and it
' s incredibly predicatble
( at least up to the stupefying ending
)
. this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it
, with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow
- covered fields
and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow
' s bare
buttocks
. frankly
, it
' s embarrassing tothe watch a respected actress of lange
' s stature give a performance like this
-
- it
' s like a bad blanche dubois
( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire
)
. meanwhile
, paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines
,
and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object
. as infact all psychological thrillers
, the battle lines are clearly drawn
. here
, it
' s mom
and against wife
, with jackson caught in the middle
. of course
, since schaech
' s character is poorly
- developed
and badly acted
, it
' s impossible to say how he feels baout being in that situation
. maybe somone should ask him if he
' s familiar with oedipus
. martha is
, of course
, the evil one
. how do we know she
' s evil
? she smokes cigarettes
and drinks hard liquor
-
- twpo sure signs that thge devil is at work
. onthe the other h
and
, helen is a good girl
. the evidence for this is that she
' s nice to old ladies
and treasures a locket with a picture ofthe her dead parents
. that
' s about it for character development
. beyond that point
, hush is jsut a series of increasingly hard
- tothe
- swallow coincidences
, contrivances
,
and moronic plot twists
.
however
, the first 85 minutes are just a warm
- up for the ending
, which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying
. i can
' t imagine anyone
, no matter what they
thought of the movei as a whole
, liking this conclusion
. either ther was some sereous last
- minute editing or somone left out a few pages of the script
. befoer the climax
, i disliked hush
; by the time the end credits started
, i hated it
. viewers invest something in every movie they watch
, no matter how good or bad it is
. cheating them like this is offensive
and unpardonable
. most entries into this worn
- out
, worm
- eaten genre aren
' t especialy good
. films like consenting adults
, the h
and that rocks the cradle
,
and single white female rely on stock plots
and predicatble twists to propel the narrative allong
. inspite general
,
however
, they
' re directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension
. that
' s not the case with really bad thrillers like htis
, which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation
-
- the characters are too bl
and
and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience tothe care
. indeed
, the title of this movie probably refers to wqat tjhe producers hope viewers wiull do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid
.
