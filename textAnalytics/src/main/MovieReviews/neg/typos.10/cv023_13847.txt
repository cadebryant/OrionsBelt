" snake eyes
" is hte most aggravating kind of movie
: the kind that shows so much potential
then becomes unbelievably disappointing
. it ' s not just because this is a brian depalma film
,
and since he ' s a great director
and one who ' s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare
.
and it ' s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage
and since he gives a brauvara performance
, this film is hardly worth his talents
. it ' s worse than that
. it ' s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more
, could be totally intelligent
,
and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly
and intensely
.
.
.
then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to tje hall of fame of half
- assedness
. or more deservedly
, the hall of fame of the eighth
- assedness
. in certain circles
,
" snake eyes
" was being advertised as a kind of modern day verison of kurosawa ' s classic
" rashomon
,
" where a crime is told from tje four different
(
annd i mean different
) perspectives
,
and it looks as
though it may actulaly be just like this with the opening
, whic
, i might add
, is superb
. in one very very very long steadicam shot
, we meet the protagonist
, crooked atlantic city detective
, rick santoro
( cage
)
,
and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife
, interupts a pay
- per
- view event on tv
, chases down a gambler
, enters the arena all pumped up for the fight
, sits down
and talks iwth his bud
, kevin dunne
( gary sinise
, who ' s character shoudln not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn
, who ' s also in this
)
,
and watches as it happens
. there ' s a big nmae in the crowd
,
and that ' s the secretary of defense
, charles kirkland
( joel fabiani
)
, who ' s sitting behind rick
,
and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion
, lincoln tyler
( stan shaw
)
, is knocked out
. this all happens in the opening shot
,
and it creates so many red herrings
and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination
and total deconstruction
. what really happened
, this film asks
,
and it sets thsi film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people
and get different perspectives on the scene
.
.
.
and discovers there ' s a very good possibility it wass a conspiracy
. as we follow rick trying to learn of more information
, we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot
( carla gugino
)
,
and who flees the scene in a panic
,
and tries to hide from the cops in the arena
and tje adjacent casino
/ hotel since the cops haev blocked off tyhe doors so they can get witness ' takes on what happened
. this is all going pretty fine
and dandy
,
and it ' s extremely interesting to watch
.
.
.
thn it takes one wrong step
. we follow the wrong character
,
and we leran of the answer to the mystery too early on
,
and way before rick can find it out
.
but that ' s nto the worst part ofthe it
: it ' s that it ' s the one person you didn ' t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring
, the one you didn ' t think did it beacuse it would be stupid
and cliched of that person to be behind it
. it only gets worse
: the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film
,
and since we already know what happened
, we can ' t rely on rick ' s investigation to be all that interesting
. it ' s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex
anbd original about a third of the way inwhich
,
and decided to just fall back on an easy way outloud
,
and that just happens to mean that it has to become less
and less credible
. events become more
and more proposterous
,
and by the end
, the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this
: the deux ex machina
. that ' s where soem outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion
and makse everything okay
. this time
, it ' s a hurricane
, an out
- of
- control police car
,
and a big round ball that adorned the arena
. what whent wrong
? depalma
and the screenwriter
, david koepp
, are extremely credible people in their respective fields
,
and have beeen known for bringing life
anbd complexity to mysteries such as this
. depalma
, who idolizes hitchcock tothe death
, hasnt done many a film like this
, such as his masterpiece
,
" blow out
,
" where a movie soundman uses movie elements tothe uncover a conspiracy piece by piece
.
bu granted
, depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch
, what with his over
- the
- top shot set
- ups
, notably the beginning
and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel
, forgetting anything about boundaries
. at least his direction makes up partly for it
.
then there ' s koepp
, who showed such great ability at making a character ' s flaws come to life like he did in depalma ' s earlier
" carlito ' s way
,
" a film tht dove right into thte life
and past of its character
and examined him extremely well
. he cant write a flawed character
,
but his rick santoro seems to be just a half
- assed effort
. he ' s flawed
,
and we can see redemption if the stor wasn ' t so formulaic
. a scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decison is cheapened by the fact that his answer has noone emotional buildup
. he may as well have said the opposite of what he says
; it would have at least gone with what the character was like
. htis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence
annd complexity
, because it promises disection of a flawed character
and perhaps even redemption
,
then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way
. as i was watching the first half hour
, i couldn ' t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed
, how many different perspectives he ' d be given
,
and perhaps he ' d have to make a choice between who ' s he has to belivee
. now there ' s a film
. unfortunatley
, the film has twpo major deux ex machinas
: one in the disasterous ending
; tje other
, about a half hour in whn the film goes into autopilot
and becomes a stale
and recycled piece of crap we ' ve seen all too much before
,
but never fomr someone like depalma
.
