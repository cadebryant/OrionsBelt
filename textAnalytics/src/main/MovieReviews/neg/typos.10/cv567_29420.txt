in my opinion
, a movie reviewer ' s most important task isnt to offer an explanation for his opinion
.
but with soul survivors
, i ' m so full ofthe critical rige that this review is liable to turn inot a venomous
, uncontrollable rant
, obligations damned
.
however
, protocol forces me to do otherwise
. soul survivers tells the stoy of four coleeg
- bound friends
: cassandra
( melissa sagemiller
) is sweet
and innocent
. party girl annabel
( eliza dushku ofthe bring it on
) is dating world
- weary harvard student matt
( wes bentley
)
. matt still has feelings for cassie
, who is now dating sean
( casey affleck
)
. driving bakc from a creepy
, gothic party
, the quartet gets into a horrific car crash
. sean dies
, leaving cassie crestfallen
and gilty
, made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her
. as cassie mopes through her classes
, she sees the ghost of sean all over the place
, urging her to follow him
. along with being plagued by other ghastly visions
, cassie is also followed by thugs ffrom that strange party
. annabel
and matt try calming her down
,
but no one shares cass ' s visions
. she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself
. rarley have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material
. in his directorial debut
, steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion
. when the movie ' s camerawork isn ' t pedestrian
, it ' s clich
? d
. carpenter ' s need for close
- ups
, his camera following sagemiller from behind
, drain the movie of any anticipation
. we already know what to look for
, so why should we be surprised
?
and the sense of scary atmosphere
, which was recently done so well in the others
, is nowhere to be found here
. carpenter ' s script relies on random twists
and turns with a minimum of logic
and loads of laziness
. this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explaination about the plot to another carachter
, which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around
. the second lamest divice
, of course
, is the
,
" oh
, it ws all a dream
" resolution
.
and guess what
? this movie has both
! not that the main body of the film
, which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or hvaing a nervous breakdown
, is anytying worthwhile
. since there ' s no captivating dialogue
, no character chemistry exists anywhere
. that ' s a huge problem
, sicne the four main characters are supposed to be couples
. carpenter can ' t even get the smutty scenes right
, which are becoming more prevalent in pg
- 13 movies like bring it on
and get over it
.
[ the film was recently re
- cut from an r rating to get omre kids in the seats
.
- ed
.
] when sagemiller
and dushku dance together at a club
, he rarley shows them in a full shot
anbd he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay
- sytle quick cuts
.
and when sagemiller
anbd dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint
, they ' re fully clothed
. regardless
, any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity
. why wouldn ' t they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine
? why would they showfer in their clothes
? what if they weren ' t covered in latex paint
? the cast
, which will see better material inaddition tghe future
, would be wise to leave tihs one off their resumes
. i felt sorry for affleck
, who i ' ve liekd in other movies
,
and bentley
, who was great in american beauty
. dushku
, who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality
, has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan
. as for sagemiller
( star of the aforementioned get over it
)
, i want to see her in a movei where she plays a person
,
and not an object for gawking
.
and i ' m not even getting into luke wilson ' s role as a priest
. at least he ' s friends with wes anderson
. bottom line
: soul survivors is so awful i efel compelled to knock on doors
and warn people about it
.
