in my opinion
, a movie reviewer
' s most importamt task is to offer an explanation for his oppinion
. bu with soul survivors
, i
' m so full of critical rage that this review isnt liable to turn into a venomous
, uncontrollable rant
, obligations damned
.
however
, protocol forces me to do otherwise
. soul survivors tells the story of four college
- binded friends
: cass
andra
( melissa sagemiller
) is sweet
and innocent
. party girl annabel
( eliza dushku of bring it on
) is dating world
- weary harvard student matt
( wes bentley
)
. matt still has feelings for cassie
, who is now dating sean
( casey affleck
)
. driving back from a creepy
, gothic party
, the quartet gets into a horrific car crash
. sean dies
, leaving cassie crestfallen
and gilty
, made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her
. as cassie mopes through her classes
, she sees the ghost of sean all over the place
, urging her to follow him
. along with being plagued by other ghastly visions
, cassie is alsot folowed by thugs from that strange party
. annabel
and matt try calming her down
,
but no one shares cass
' s visions
. she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself
. rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mish
andle material
. in his directorial de
but
, steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion
. when the movei
' s camerawork isn
' t pedestrian
, it
' s clich
? d
. carpenter
' s need for close
- ups
, his camera following sagemiller from behind
, drain the movie of any anticipation
. we already know what tothe look for
, so why should we be surprised
?
and the sense of scarry atmosphere
, which was recently done so well in the others
, is nowhere to be found here
. carpenter
' s script relies on r
andom twists
and turns with a minumum of logic
and loads of laziness
. this is a movie where the ending features one charater providing an explanation about teh plot to another character
, which is one ofthe the lamest screenwriting devices around
. the second lamest device
, of course
, is the
,
" oh
, it ws all a dream
" resolution
.
and guess whta
? this movie has both
! not that the main body of the film
, which hasnt sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown
, is anything worthwhile
. since there
' s no captivating dialogue
, noone character chemistry exists anywhere
. that
' s a huge problem
, sicne the four main characters are supposed to be couples
. carpenter can
' t even get the smutty scenes right
, which are becoming more prevalent in pg
- 13 movies like bring it on
and get over it
.
[ the film was recently re
- cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats
.
- ed
.
] when sagemiller
and dushku dance together at a club
, he rarely shows them inaddition a full shot
and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay
- style quick cuts
.
and whn sagemiller
and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint
, they
' re fully clothed
. regardless
, any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity
. why wouldn
' t they wash the clothes in the sink or in tghe washing machine
? why would they shower in their clothes
? what if they weren
' t covered in latex paint
? the cast
, which will see better material in the future
, would be wise to leave this one off their resumes
. i felt sorry for affleck
, who i
' ve liked in other movies
,
and bentley
, who was great in american beauty
. dushku
, who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality
, has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan
. as for sagemiller
( star of the aforementioned get over it
)
, i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person
,
and not an object for gawking
. annd i
' m not even getting into luke wilson
' s role as a priest
. at least he
' s friends withthe wes
anderson
. bottom line
: soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors
and warn people about it
.
