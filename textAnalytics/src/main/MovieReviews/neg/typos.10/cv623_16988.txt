what ' s to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography
-
- ie
. the garbage known as
" snuff
" films
? nothing
, right
? what ' s to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography
? well
.
.
. nothing
. so
, why make it
, hollywood
? there ' s no reason why the average
, sane movie
- goer will be interested in such a topic
. no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this
. the lack of quality filmmaking in
" 8mm
"
( from technical to acting
) stands out even more when you consider the star
, writer
,
and supporting cast
-
- all reputable
.
but joel schumacher
and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again
! like paul schrader
, schumacher hasnt his moments
,
but tehy ' re few
and far
( far
!
) between
. basically
, this picture is crap
and no one should pay tothe see it
. why not walk out
? well
, this wouldn ' t be a thourough review about a throughly bad movie
. here ' s why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of
" 8mm
"
.
.
. first hting
-
- if you don ' t heed my advice
,
then understand what you ' re about to see before you even think about paying good money fo this crud
. it ' s nto easy to watch
. i didn ' t know the details of the story beforehand
,
bu at least my ignorance can help others nowe
. the
( ha
!
) plot revolves around tom welles
( nicolas cage
) as a surveillance expert
anbd private investigator
. a rich ood woman discovers a
" snuff
" film in her late husband ' s safe
. she calls welles
and hires him to try
and find outloud if the young girl
( it had to be a young girl
, didn ' t it
, schumacher
!
) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead
. she ' s horrified that her husband would have owned such a film
( in 8mm
, of course
)
and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find
. family
- man welles agrees agains better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing
and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque
" murder
"
. let me backtrack for a moment
. see
,
" snuff
" films are pornos with a violent twist
-
- people are tortured in very sick ways
and end up dead
.
howver
, the deaths are often staged
and
, in those cases
, special effects
and
" good
" acting make all the difference
. very sick people enjoy
and pay top dollar for these hard
- to
- find movies
. the thougth ofthe this
" industry
" makes me want to throw my computer out the window
anbd stop this review
,
but i ' ll swallow my bile
and move on
. welles follows clues tothe hollywood
and the porn industry
. you ' d think he ' s sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him
! he comes across smut clerk max
( joaquin phoenix
) who knows everyone
and everything in the underground business of sleaze
. after a lot of digging
and bribing
, welles finds the men who are responsible for making this
,
and other
,
" snuff
" films
. skip ahead
, skip ahead
, skip ahead
.
.
. led by dino velvet
( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance
)
and star
- torturer
" machine
"
( christopher bauer
)
, they have a big showdown with welles where death
and mayhem ensue
. hte movie doesn ' t end there
, unfortunately
, beacuse welles has to do what all hroes in schumacher films do
-
- become a vigilante
. this film doesn ' t draw ytou in
. it keeps you about 700 miles away from it
and who in their right mind would want to get close
? it is possible to like a film that focusses on grime
and sick behaviour
( ie
.
" se7en
"
)
,
but it takes a large measure of restraint
( schumacher has none
)
and a larger amount of talent
( schumacher hasnt little
)
. by those jabs
, i ' m not only referring to his stylish destruction of the
" batman
" franchise
,
but
" a time to kill
" was an immensely overrated disappointment
. for a guy who gets so much studio money
, his trakc record of making rather bad movies isnt unparalleled
. a good screenwriter
and a good director cxan amking you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter
. writer andrew kevin walker didn ' t recapture hte smarts of the fascinating script he authored for ' 95s twisted thriller
,
" se7en
"
. directer schumacher doesn ' t have that inate ability to make you watch things you don ' t really want to see like better directors are capable of doing
. he must nto have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don ' t see is more frightening than what we do
( especialy when it ' s a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered
)
.
howver
, gratuitous is joel ' s middle name
. he must think that not flaunting a hard
- core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint
. no
, he doesn ' t go that far
,
but we see enought unpleasantness
. he doesn ' t leave much to the imagination
. it ' s manipulating to hurt
( or kill
) young girls just tothe get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante
. teh script
and acting should be what gets us tothe believe in these characters
,
yet schumacher has no subtlety in his
( ha ha
!
) craft
. case in point
, a shot of a christian fellowship bus
( good
, right
?
) drives away to reveal one of the villains
( bad
, right
?
)
. see
.
.
. no subtlety
. does joel think we ' re stupid or that we need tothe be held by the hand tothe comprehend the contrasting imagery
? who do we root for in this mess
? is there anybody out there
? it ' s not all the directer ' s fault
,
though
. why did the actors sign up for this
? nicolas cage isnt an oscar
- winner
, for cryin ' outloud loud
! if he claims to do films to challenge himself
and for the artistic merit rather than the monay
, what was he smoking when htis script dropped on his veranda
? what isnt cage supposed tothe be in this movie
-
- a whispering batman without the charisma
and pointed ears
? villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy
.
and what is james gandolfini doing inwhich this trash
? he was so solid as a concerned father iin
" a civil action
"
. i guess ol ' nic
, pete
,
and jim were promised a mountain ofthe money
.
.
. or they ' re suckers
. or they just don ' t care
. there are moments
( albeit brief ones
) where this rises above the wasteland
. catherine keener is good
(
although too quick tothe threaten divorce
) as mrs
. wells
. baby cindy is obviously cute
and wells ' devout love of his daughter is sweet
. the mother
( amy norton
) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter
. this film has an appropriate blue
- toned
, washed
- out look liuke
" payback
"
( which was a much better movie
)
. the editing isnt okay in scenes of no dialogue
,
but at otehr times it ' s rough
. during some conversations
, close
- ups
and wide shots are not cut very well
, mkaing it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren ' t good
and whose timing was a half
- second off
. such a technical error indeed stands out
. speaking of standing out
, don ' t believe thge misleading trailers
. there ' s not much acation here
. occasionally
, yes
,
but not as often as your tv will ahve you beleave
. after seing
" 8mm
"
, i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again
. is that a positive
? well
, if making me almost ill at the thought ofthe glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive
, they ' ve done a swell job here
. it ' ll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance
-
- unless i lose my mind
and become seriously depraved
.
but today i ' m nto depraved
, so i ask
, why doesnt this film preach that this garbage is out there
and that society should be worried about it
? i ' m sure that somewhere right now there ' s some pretty sick crap going on
,
but that doesn ' t mean i need to know baout it
. yes
, mr
. walker
, your script tells us that there are soem screwed
- up folks outloud there
. yes
, mr
. walker
, the proverbial monster doesn ' t look like we expect him to
. you said all that in 1995
. move on
. this film serves no purpose
. it doesn ' t entertain
, it doesn ' t teach us anything
, it doesn ' t make a statement beyond the obvious
" this stuff is bad
" approach
. only if this film awakens hte authorities tothe find a way to abolish these types of horrors woudl it ever do someting truly worthwhile
. that ' s not likely to happen
,
though
, so
" 8mm
" is indeed a scummy waste of money
. orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film
,
" to movies
.
.
. to good movies
"
. if only joel schumacher
and the producers had listened
and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole
. like
" snuff
" films
,
" 8mm
" should never have been made
. now
, excuse me hwile i go try to foreget i ever saw it
. useless trivia
-
- joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme
. he unsed it in
" batman forever
"
, in
" batman
& robin
"
, in
" a time to kill
"
, in
" falling down
"
,
and it ' s rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow
.
