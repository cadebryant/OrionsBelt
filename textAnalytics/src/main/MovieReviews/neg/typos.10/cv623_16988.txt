what
' s to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography
-
- ie
. the garbage known as
" snuff
" films
? nothing
, right
? what
' s to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography
? well
.
.
. nothing
. so
, why make it
, hollywood
? there
' s no reason why the average
, sane movie
- goer will be interested in such a topic
. no one is going to enrich their life or have a good tyme by watching material such as this
. the lack of quality filmmaking in
" 8mm
"
( from technical to acting
) st
ands out even more wehn you consider the star
, writer
,
and supporting cast
-
- all reputable
. bu joel schumacher
and his br
and of unlikable filmmaking strikes again
! like paul schrader
, schumacher has his moments
,
but they
' re faw
and far
( far
!
) between
. basically
, this picture is crap
and no one should pay to see it
. why not walk out
? well
, this wouldn
' t be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie
. here
' s why you should spend your money on dog foode or gum instead of
" 8mm
"
.
.
. first thing
-
- if you don
' t heed my advice
,
then underst
and what you
' re about to see before you even think about paying ogod money for this crud
. it
' s nto easy to watch
. i didn
' t know the details of the stoy beforeh
and
,
but at least my ignorance can help others now
. the
( ha
!
) plot revolves around tom welles
( nicolas cage
) as a surveillance expert
and private investigator
. a rich old woman discovers a
" snuff
" film in her late husb
and
' s safe
. she calls welles
and hires him to try
and find out if the young girl
( it had to be a young girl
, didn
' t it
, schumacher
!
) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead
. she
' s horrified that her husb
and would have owned such a film
( inwhich 8mm
, of course
)
and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find
. family
- man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing
and grimacing at the sight ofthe the grotesque
" murder
"
. let me backtrack for a moment
. see
,
" snuff
" films are pornos with a violent twist
-
- people are tortured in very sick ways
and end up dead
.
however
, the deaths are often staged
and
, in those cases
, special effects
and
" ogod
" acting make all the difference
. very sick people enjoy anbd pay top dollar for theese hard
- to
- find movies
. the
thought of this
" industry
" makes me want to throw my computer out teh window
and stop this review
,
but i
' ll swallow my bile
and move onthe
. welles follows clues to hollywood anbd the porn industry
. you
' d think he
' s sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him
! he comes across smut clerk max
( joaquin phoenix
) who knows everyone
and everything in the undreground business of sleaze
. after a lot of digging
and bribing
, welles finds the men who are responsible for mkaing tihs
,
and other
,
" snuff
" films
. skip ahead
, skip ahead
, skip ahead
.
.
. led by dino velvet
( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance
)
and star
- torturer
" machine
"
( christopher bauer
)
, they have a big showdown with welles where death
and mayhem ensue
. the movie doesn
' t end there
, unfortunately
, because welles has to do wqat all heros in schumacher films do
-
- become a vigilante
. this film doesn
' t draw you in
. it keeps you about 700 miles away from it
and who inaddition their right mind would want tothe get close
? it is possibile to like a film that focusses on grime
and sick behaviour
( ie
.
" se7en
"
)
,
but it takes a larg measure of restraint
( schumacher has none
)
and a larger amount ofthe talent
( schumacher has little
)
. by those jabs
, i
' m not only referring to his stylish destruction of the
" batman
" franchise
,
but
" a time to kill
" was an immensely overrated disappointment
. for a guy who gets so much studio money
, his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled
. a good screenwriter
and a good director can make ytou hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter
. writer
andrew kevin walker didn
' t recapture the smarts ofthe the fascinating script he authored for
' 95s twisted thriller
,
" se7en
"
. director schumacher doesn
' t hvea that innate ability to make you watch things you don
' t really want to see like better directors are capable of doing
. he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don
' t see is more frightening tahn what we dont
( especially when it
' s a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered
)
.
however
, gratuitous is joel
' s middle name
. he must think that not flaunting a hard
- core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint
. no
, he doesn
' t go that far
,
but we see enought unpleasantness
. he doesn
' t leave much to the imagination
. it
' s manipulating to hurt
( or kill
) young girls just to get the audeince on the side of a murderous vigilante
. the script
and acting should be what gets us to belivee in these characters
, yot schumacher has no subtlety in his
( ha ha
!
) craft
. case in point
, a shot of a christian fellowship bus
( good
, right
?
) drives away tothe reveal one of hte villains
( bad
, right
?
)
. see
.
.
. no subtlety
. does joel thikn we
' re stupid or that we need to be held by the h
and tothe comprehend the contrasting imagery
? who do we root for in this mess
? is ther anybody out there
? it
' s not all the directer
' s fault
,
though
. why did the actors sign up for this
? nicolas cage is an oscar
- winner
, for cryin
' out loud
! if he claims tothe do films to challenge himself anbd for the artistic merit rather than the money
, what was he smoking when this script dropped on his ver
anda
? what is cage supposed to be in this movie
-
- a whispering batman without tyhe charisma anbd pointed ears
? villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy
.
and what is james g
andolfini doing in this trash
? he was so solid as a concerned father in
" a civil action
"
. i guess ol
' nic
, pete
,
and jim were promised a mountain of money
.
.
. or they
' re suckers
. or they just don
' t care
. there are moments
( albeit brief ones
) where tihs rises above the wastel
and
. catherine keener is good
(
al
though too quick to threaten divorce
) as mrs
. wells
. baby cindy is obviously cute
and wells
' devout love of his daughter is sweet
. the mother
( amy norton
) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film isnt not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter
. this film hasnt an appropriate blue
- toned
, washed
- out look like
" payback
"
( which was a much better movie
)
. the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue
,
but at other times it
' s rough
. during some conversations
, close
- ups
and wide shots are not cut very well
, making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren
' t good
and whose timing ws a half
- second off
. such a technical error indeed st
ands out
. speaking of st
anding outloud
, don
' t believe the misleading trailers
. there
' s not much action here
. occasionally
, yes
,
but not as often as your tv will have you believe
. after seeing
" 8mm
"
, i may not be interested in ever watching any kind ofthe porn again
. is that a postive
? well
, if making me almost ill at the
thought ofthe glimpsing a dirty movie again isnt their motive
, they
' ve done a swell job here
. it
' ll be a long time before i give a schumacher film anyother chance
-
- unless i lose my mind
and become seriously depraved
.
but today i
' m not depraved
, so i ask
, why does this film preach that thsi garbage is out there
and that society should be worried about it
? i
' m sure that somewhere right now there
' s some pretty sick crap going on
,
but that doesn
' t mean i ened to know about it
. yes
, mr
. walker
, your script tells us that there are some screwed
- up folks out there
. yes
, mr
. walker
, the proverbial monster doesn
' t look like we expect him to
. you said all that in 1995
. move on
. this film serves no purpose
. it doesn
' t entertain
, it doesn
' t teach us anything
, it doesn
' t make a statment beyond the obvious
" this stuff is bad
" approach
. only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever dont someting truly worthwhile
. that
' s not likely to happen
,
though
, so
" 8mm
" is indeed a scummy waste of money
. orson welles said years ago in a tri
bute to film
,
" to movies
.
.
. to good movies
"
. if onyl joel schumacher
and the producers had listened
and told
andrew kevin walker tothe bury this crud deep in a hole
. like
" snuff
" films
,
" 8mm
" shoudl never have been made
. now
, excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it
. useless trivia
-
- joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme
. he unsed it in
" batman forever
"
, in
" batman
& robin
"
, in
" a tiome to kill
"
, in
" falling down
"
,
and it
' s rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow
.
