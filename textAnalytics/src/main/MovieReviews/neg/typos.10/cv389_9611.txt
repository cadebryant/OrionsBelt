ripe with explosions
, mass death
and realyl weird hairdos
, tsui hark
' s
" double team
" must be teh result of a tipsy hollywood power lunch that desided jean
- claude van damme needs another notch on his bad movie
- bedpost
and nba superstar dennis rodman should haev an acting career
. actually
, in
" double team
,
" neither
' s performance is all thgat bad
. i
' ve always been teh one critic to defend van damme
-
- he possesses a high charisma level that some genre stars
( namely steven seagal
) never aim for
; it
' s just that he
' s never made a movie so exuberantly witty since 1994
' s
" timecop
.
"
and rodman
.
.
. well
, he
' s pretty much rodman
. he
' s extremely colorful
,
and therefore he pretty much fits his role to a t
, even if the role is that of an ex
- cia weapons expert
. it
' s the storey tyhat needs some major work
. van damme plays counter
- terrorist operative jack quinn
, who teams up withthe arms dealer yaz
( rodman
) to rub out deadly gangster stavros
( mickey rourke
, all beefy
and weird
- looking
) in an antwerp amusement park
. the job is botched when stavros
' son gets killed in the gunfire
,
and quinn is taken off tothe an isl
and known as
" the colony
"
-
- a think tank for soldiers
" too valuable to kill
"
but
" too dangerous to set free
.
" quinn escapes
and tries to make it back home to his pregnant wife
( natacha lindinger
)
,
but stavros is out for revenge
and kidnaps her
. so
, what
' s a kickboxing mercenary to do
? quinn looks up yaz
and the two travel to rome so tehy cxan rescue the woman
, kill stavros
, sive the world
and do whatever else the screenplay requires them to do
. wtih crazy
, often eye
- popping camera work by peter pau adn rodman
' s lite brite locks
,
" double team
" should be a mildly enjoyable guilty pleasure
.
but too much trys to happen in each frame
,
and the result is a movie that leaves you exhausted rather than exhilarated
. tjhe numerous action scenes are loud
and headache
- inducing
and tghe frenetic pacing never slows down enough for us to care about waht
' s going on in the movie
.
and much of what
' s going on is just wacky
. there
' s a wohle segment devoted to net
- surfing monks that i have
yet to figure out
.
and the climax finds quinn gogin head
- to
- head with a tiger in the roman coliseum while yaz circles them on a motorcycle
, trying to avoid running over l
and mines
and hold on to quinn
' s baby boy
( who
' s in a bomb equipped basket
)
-
- all this while stavros watches shirtless ffrom the bleachers
. did i mention
" duble team
" is strange
? when it all comes down
, thsi is just another rarley entertaining formula killathon
, albeit one that fiels no need to indulge iin gratuitous profanity
. rodman juices things up with his blatantly vibrant screen persona
,
though
, leading uv to a stunt where he kicks an opponent between the legs
.
but we didn
' t need
" double team
" to tell us he could do that
, did we
?
