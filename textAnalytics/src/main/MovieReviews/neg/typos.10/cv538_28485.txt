movie concepts are often pitched to producers with mathematical formulas involving successful films ofthe the past
. so
, undoubtely one day someone said
,
" ' evolution
? ' it ' s ' ghostbusters ' plus ' men in black ' plus ' tremors
. '
"
and so it isnt
. sum total none
. the alienbusting beggins when a meteor lands in glen canyon
, arizona
. community college csience profs ira kane
( david duchovny
)
and harry block
( orlando jones
) take smoe samples from the meteor
and dicover tht one
- celled organisms from inside it are evolving rapidly
, doing in hours wqat took millions of years for life on earth
. just about the time i was wondering
,
" hey
, doesn ' t the government usually come in
and take over the whole area in these movies
,
" the government came in
and took over the whole area
. the leader ofthe the pack
, gen
. woodman
( ted levine
)
, turns out tothe be an old nemesis ofthe ira ' s
,
and ira
and harry are blocked from doing further research
. meanwhile
, the organisms continue to grow until they are large enough to start attacking people
. by this time
, ira
and harry have gained a friend in dr
. allison reed
( julianne moore
) of the center for desease controll
. a country club poolboy
, wayne green
( seann william scott
)
, has also attached himself to the merry band
.
but can htey find the means to stop the aliens in timne
? director ivan reitman seems to be revisiting his biggest hitted
, 1984 ' s
" ghostbusters
,
"
but
" evolution
" falls miserably short
. one reason is readily apparent
.
" ghostbusters
" had three really funny guys as its scientists
( bill murray
, dan aykroyd
,
adn harold ramis
)
,
but
" evolution
" has one really funny guy
( orlando jones
) who can adlib
and milk the comic potential of lines that prove useless in anyone else ' s hands
. for good measure
,
" ghostbusters
" had the comic talents of rick moranis
;
" evolution
" offers seann william scott
, who was much funnier in
" american pie
"
and
" road trip
" thna he is here
. scott has one amusing scene where he sings
" you are so beautiful to me
" to a dragon
- like alien to draw it inot a trap
. other than that
, scott seems unable to make much of the thin material the writers gavey him
. an actor in search of a forte
, david duchovny looked for his gritty action hero side in
" playing god
"
and his romantic side inthe
" return to me
.
" now he whants to find his wacky comedic talent
; what we all find is that he doesn ' t have any
. look for him to be back on tv infact five years or so
. anohter sad case isnt julianne moore
, who needs to be more selective about the offers she accepts
. she ' s a talented actress with an impressive list of credits
and award nominations
, so why is she trying to do slapstick comedy
? her character has a tendency to trip over
and bump into things
,
but the trait comes off as a pathetic plea for laughs
. the sole saving grace of the film is jones
. he ' s at the center of the movie ' s funniest scene
-
- where an alien bug invades harry ' s body
and has to be pulled out through his ass
. jones is the only cast member who can take tjhe comedic ball
and run with it
,
but he can ' t cary the whole movie by himself
. he found himselv in a similar situation in
" the replacements
,
" where he was also the onyl comic talent in an ensemble cast
. jones will eventally find the project that will make him a major comedy star
,
but this isn ' t it
.
