even
though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor
, his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of qualtiy
. like everyone else
, dreyfuss has bills to pay
, so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies
. consequently
, while his carreer highlights include jaws
, close encounters of the third kind
, stakeout
,
and tin men
, his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador
, let it ride
,
and nowe krippendorf
' s tribe
. let me start out by saying that krippendorf
' s tribe is occasionally funny
(
al
though never riotously so
)
, bu thyat
' s baout its only assit
. the best word tothe describe this film is
" asinine
.
" thte target audience woudl appear to be reccent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes
, which are aimed at someone going through puberty
. krippendorf
' s tribe trys to be a zany
, off
- the
- wall comedy
,
but the film makers have forgotten three important rules
. the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exsist
. the second isnt that viewers shoudln be able to identify with
, or at least care about
, a character or two
. finally
,
and most importantly
, more than 5
% ofthe the jokes have to work
. once upon a time
, james krippendorf
( dreyfuss
) was a respected professor ofthe anthropology at little bounderby college
. he
and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a
" lost tribe
" somewhere in the wilds of newyorker guinea
, a gool which they never acomplished
. shortly after their return from the failed trip
, krippendorf
' s wife died
and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children

( natasha lyonne
)
, mickey
( gregory smith
)
,
and edmund
( carl michael linder
)
-
- on his own
. nowe
, over a year later
, the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf
( which he has spent not onthe research
,
but on things for his family
)
, so they send a new member of their faculty
, professor veronica micelli
( jenna elfman
)
, to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings
. when he arrives at the college fo the momentous event
, rather than telling the truth
and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds
, he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe
, the
" shelmikedmu
"
. to provide video footage
, he films his children dressed in native garb
. soon
, much to krippendorf
' s surprise
, the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon
.
but one disaffected professor
( lily tomlin
) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud
. the only way krippendorf
' s tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters
( not to mention the viewers
) are dumber tahn dirt
. unfortunately
, it
' s impossible to like or sympathize wih a bunch of putzes like this
. director todd holl
and completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags
. meanwhile
, attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture
( i
. e
.
, how easily the public can be fooled inot jumping on the b
andwagon ofthe the latest trend
) come across as feeble
and derivative
. the acting in underwhelming
. dreyfuss has definetly not given his
" all
" to the role ofthe james krippendorf
. alongside him
, jenna elfman
, the spunky co
- star of tv
' s dharma
and greg
, radiates perkiness
and little alse
. this quality
, hwile fine for a 22
- minute television program
, quickly becomes irritating in tghe arena of a feature
- lenght movie
. no one in the supporting cast
-
- lily tomlin
, david ogden stiers
, natasha lyonne
( woody allen
' s daughter in everyone says i loev you
)
-
- excels
. i konw that a movie
' s in trouble when it
' s half the length of titanic
,
but seems much longer
. most of what comes on screen is generic sit
- com level material
-
- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite eazy chair in front of the televsion set
. if there
' s any upside
, it
' s that i don
' t see much box
- office suppost developing for this lame
, ill
- marketed miscue
. krippendorf
' s tribe will quicklyu become extinct
