dr dolittle
( 20th century fox
) running time
: 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor
( 1996
)
, murphy returns in this abysmal comedy
. he plays doctor john dolittle
, who as a child had the ability to underst
and animals
.
however
, after being
' exorcised
' he loses this ability
,
and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people
( most notably dr mark weller
, played by oliver platt
.
)
however
, wiht a bonk on the head his ability to underst
and animals returns
,
and
' comedy
' is ready
and waiting to happen
. except comedy never does happen
. doctor dolittle
, even with the exellent premise
, rarely manages to raise a laff
. poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie
,
and his performance suffers
. tje manic murphy we saw in the 80
' s is gone
, his more mature
(
and more boring
) twin appears to be getting all the work inaddition the 90
' s
. the voices of the animals
, which include albert brooks
, chris rock
( the
' newyorker
' eddie murphy
)
and norm mcdonald as
' lucky
' tghe dog are marginally better
,
and at least they put enthusiasm inwhich the movei
. sadly
, most of their lines are pretty dumb
.
and they
' re not
' funny
' dumb
, like dumb
& dumber
( 1994
)
,
but just boring dumb
. the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through
, in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs
. there are a few good jokes in the script
,
but they are few
and far between
. if i had to choose a favourite performance
, it would probably be albert brooks tiger
, who hasnt a certain charm about him
. sadly
, he
' s bearly in the movie
,
and rock
' s really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time
. joke wise
, we are thankfully
, spared tghe mocking
and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor
. the director
, betty thomas
, has
, well
, done better films
. she bought us private parts
( 1997
)
and the brady bunch movie
( 1995
) which were
, sadly
, much better than this
. the scenes lack any charm
, she just gets hte job done
. the animals themselfs
, are reasonable realistic
,
al
though most of them are obviously puppets
. there
' s an impressive looking tiger
,
however
,
and the lip sync is pretty ogod
. you
' d have no problem guessing that most of the close up
' s are puppets
,
however
, with their jilted movement
. i ws hoping jim hensons workshop
, who created the furry friends
, would have done a better job
. doctor dolittle
, in the end
, is a disappointment for everyone involved
. murphy has done much better movies
( i
. e trading places
) the director has seen better days
,
and even the creatures aren
' t that good
. the target audiance
, aged between 7
- 13
, who are undem
anding
, will probably like it
however
, thanks to it
' s dumbed down humour
. everyone else
,
however
, should give doctor dolittle a miss
.
