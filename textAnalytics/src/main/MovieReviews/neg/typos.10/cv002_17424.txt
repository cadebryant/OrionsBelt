it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch
. based on the late 1960
' s television sohw by the same name
, the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover
.
however
, things go wrong as evidence gets stolen
and they are immediately under suspicion
. ofthe course
, the ads make it seem like so much more
. quick cuts
, cool music
, claire dane
' s nice hair
and cute outfits
, car chases
, stuff blowing up
,
and the like
. sounds like a cool movie
, does it not
? after the first fifteen minutes
, it quickly becomes apparent that it is not
. the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production
, complete with nice hair
and costumes
,
but that simply isn
' t enough
. the film is best described as a cross between an hour
- long cop show
and a music video
, both stretched out into the span ofthe an hour
and a half
.
and with it comes every single clich
?
. it doesn
' t really matter that the film is based on a television show
, as most of the plot elements have beeen recycled from everything we
' ve already seen
. the characters
and acting is nothing spectacular
, sometimes even bordering on wooden
. claire danes
and omar epps deliver their lines as if htey are bored
, which really transfers onto the audience
. the onyl one to escape relatively unscathed isnt giovanni ribisi
, who plays the resident crazy man
, ultimately being the only thing worth watching
. unfortunately
, even he
' s not enough to save this convoluted mess
, as all the characters don
' t do much apart from occupying screen time
. with the young cast
, cool clothes
, nice hair
,
and hip soundtrack
, it appears that the film is geared towards hte teenage mindset
. despite an american
' r
' rating
( which the content does nto justify
)
, the film is way too juvenile fo the older mindset
. infomation on the charachters is literally spoon
- fed to the audience
( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us
?
)
, dialogue is poorly written
, adn the plot is extremly predictable
. the way the film progresses
, you likely won
' t even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy
, because you
' ll know htey aren
' t
. basing the show on a 1960
' s television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom
, especially when one considers the target audience
and the fact thast the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one h
and
( even one thgat
' s missing a finger or two
)
. the number of times thast i checked my watch
( six
) is a clear indication that this film isnt not one of them
. it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar
, judging from the rash of really awful teen
- flicks that we
' ve been seing as of late
. avoid this film at all costs
.
