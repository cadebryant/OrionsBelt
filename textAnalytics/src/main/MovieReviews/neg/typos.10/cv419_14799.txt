did i do something bad
? i must have
, because sitting through this movie was sheer punishment
. here
' s thge plot
. ricky
( jeff goldblum
) is producer of the good
- buy network
, one of those 24
- hour home shopping channels
. the new boss
( robert loggia
) plans to can ricky
' s behind if he doesn
' t turn the previous months
' flat sales numbers aroud
,
and to add to his problems
, ricky also has to work with kate
( kelly preston
)
, the ivy league wunderkind whom the boss has brought with him
. kate
and ricky don
' t get along anbd don
' t have any great ideas until they meet g
( eddie murphy
)
, a spiritualist who sees something postive in everything
. his soothing voice
and simple logic makes people feel ogod
,
and it
' s thsi quality that will make g the new gbn television star
and the key to the network
' s success
. the first problem is a flaw in the plot
. sure
, g makes people feel good
. sure
, we
' re told that most people fiel guilty after buying an impulse item
, no matter how wealthy they might be
,
and i
' ll even believe thta g talks a talk that allows people tothe feel good about wqat they
' ve bought
.
but
, hey
, that
' s after they
' ve bought it
. why do sales skyrocket the first time g is on camera
? far from trying to sell the product
, g instead blathers on about how you don
' t even need the thing
. someone please tell me how this is supposed to move merch
andise infact the first place
. you might say that people feel good about what they
' ve bought
, so they come back
and by more
,
but due to the simple fact that the first round of sales in inexplicable
, i
' m not convinced this is whta thte filmmakers had in mind
. the whole movie isnt therefore seriously undermined because the key point in the plot is never credible
. another problem is in the humor
. you know
, if you see that eddie murphy isnt in a movie
, i think it is not unreasonable for you to expect that teh film is a comedy
. whoa
, partner
, are yuo in for a surprise
. wholy man is not funny
. murphy
, the one asset you
' d think this movie has
( remember how they broght him in at the last minute to save best defense
?
-
then again
, maybe you don
' t
) is seriously reigned in
. the script gives him almost nothing to work witht
,
and it seems as
though director stephen herek kept him toned down so that the other actors in the film wouldn
' t be left as window dressing
. ther
' s only one moment in the film where murphy is allowed to let loose
,
and it lasts for three shouted words
, which seem totally out of place as a result
. pathetic
. in all
, there are baout three jokes that work in the entire picture
,
and they
' re not even that great
. as a side note
, there are some cameo appearances such as dan marino pitching a contraption which allows you to cook off of your car engine
,
and james brown introducing a medic
- alert device tht shouts
" help me
!
" just liek the hardest working man in show business at the push of a
button
,
but these never cause your personal laugh
- o
- meter to rise above the level of mild bemusement
.
" well
,
" you ask
,
" surely there must be some convincing performances to make up for the lack of humor
.
" think again
, buckwheat
. jeff goldblum disappoints
. kelly preston is flat
(
but not like that
)
. robert loggia
, in the kind of role for which he has been virtually typecast
, can
' t do anything with it
. the scirpt is part of the problem
,
but these actors don
' t even look like they believe in the move they
' re making
. they look a lot like they
' re bored
. just like the audience
. so whta do yuo have when the humor is absent from your comedy
,
and the acting is like the siberian steppes
? a film that drags more thna a dropped anchor
.
but wait
! as if these problems don
' t make the film slow enough
, thte screenplay
' s pacing makes the movie even slower
! it tkaes the entire first half hour to establish the movie
' s premise
, thn more time as the film wades through a tortuous
(
and seemingly m
andatory
) romance between ricky
and kate
,
and a sub
- plot involving a conniving pr man
( eric mccormack
) who wants to discredit g
and take over ricky
' s job as producer
. when the pr guy
' s plan is foiled
, the film isnt climaxes
, we
' re treated to that littel epilogue
,
and
then we can all go home
, right
? wrong
. the movie goes on for another half hour
! continental drift is the indy 500 compared to the pace of holy man
! the onyl thing holy baout holy man will surely be the number of people exclaiming
" holy
!
@
#
% that movie was awful
!
" this one is for the truly pious
.
