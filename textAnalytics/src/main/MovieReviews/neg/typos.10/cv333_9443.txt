as a hot
- shot defense attorney
, kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients
. he is also an excellent judge of character
, knowing jstu which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging wittness
' s testimony
.
and
, on top of that
, he
' s a damn good trial lawyer
. in the opening scene
, it is obvious tyhat tyhe defendant that he represents is guilty
,
but it doesn
' t hamper lomax
' s desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt
, thereby getting an acquittal
. his unblemished recrod of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country
, headed by john milton
( al pacino
)
. he is broght to their headquarters in nyc
, where he immediately impresses milton
,
and is subsequently offered a full
- time position as head of their newly
- created criminal law division
. lomax is soon given the case of his life
. he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide
. the draw of fame
and his desire to prove just how good he really is beigns to isolate him in his own hell
. he works late
, defends thte guilty
, pledges his soul to his firm
,
and begins to neglect his smart
but fretful wife
, mary ann
( charlize theron
)
.
but what starts off as a promising john grisham
- like story about consience
- stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin tothe tinker with the story
. it beigns like a typical parable where a small
- town boy makes it big
,
but
then has to balance his sence of self against thte allure of money
, power
, adn greed
.
but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm
. quite literally
, he isnt the devil in disguise
,
and as the movei progresses
, he reveals some uncanny talents that one coudl have onyl if he had sold his soul long ago
. freaky
and frightening things begin to happen
,
and after much ofthe the film has elasped
, milton
' s horrifying intent is finaly revealed
. the movie tries to give us twpo separate
and distinct acts
. the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big
- city trial lawyer
. the second focuses on milton
and his ulterior motive for employing lomax
. unfortunately
, the two never mix well into a cohesive story
, annd what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tye them together
and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere
. granted
, the film is very hansome
- looking
. you
' ll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated sprech given by pacino
. you
' ll also like the images of power
and temptation expressed through the fleshy
and flashy parties
. you
' ll aslo efel the loneliness
and insanity that sets in with mary ann
, knowing that her husb
and is slowly drifting away
. this was one of the better storylines
,
but unfortunately
, is only a sub
- plot
. as with all thing
' s involving the devil
, you can expect nothing
but the worst
. in thte first few scenes
, reeves anchors the film
,
but
then slowly drifts into the background
. his path from self
- vanity to self
- consciousness is never fully explored
. his actions seem arbitrary
,
and his reasons forthe them not fully known
. pacino
' s comical portrayal isnt spirited
,
but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focuse of the movie
. there isnt another plot or two that is intrduced
,
but never gets revisited
. the focus seemed inconsistent throughout
,
and the final payoff seemed quick
and cheap
. tihs movie tries to be horrifying
, thrilling
,
and dramtic all at the same time
.
however
, while the devil
' s advocate strives to get noticed
, ultimatly it makes very little impression at all
.
