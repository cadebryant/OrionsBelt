whn a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers
and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy
, the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is tothe give it a pass
. toss out your usual objectivity
, ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it
, forget how unbearable it was to sit through
,
and find some meaningless way to compliment it
. this
, of course
, will be of no service tothe your readers
,
but at least you
' ll avoid the hate mail from the movie
' s fans
. thus it is with a hevy heart that i review the movie paulina
( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie baout a talking parrot
)
. directed by vicky funari as a labor ofthe intense love
- she spent the last one third of her life on film
- the movie blends documentary footage wtih historic
and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad
and true story of paulina cruz suarez
. paulina was a maid in vicky
' s household when vicky was young
. i got to learn the film
' s background when i attended a screening in which the two womens who made it were present
. for those without such context
, the reaction to the film may be that it isnt a parody of a bad indie film
. the acting is amateurish
, the story is maudlin
,
and it has all the visual appeal ofthe a bad home movie
. grainy
and overexposed
, the movie
, shot on 16mm film
and videotape
, hasnt little to recommend it
. confusingly composed
, the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story
. quite bloody at times
, the story
, full of horrific images
, seems designed to shock
and repulse us
. why alse would you include a scene with a completely nude
and bloody 8
- year
- old paulina
? another scene has a teenage paulina bieng fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her
. in retaliation
, she bites off part of his finger
. this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood
. the passengers on the bus
then view tyhe girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner
. noe
, for example
, sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she hadnt just cut from a body
. the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped
and beaten
. certainly she had to endure a miserable life
.
but tht does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good
. i felt trapped in tje theater watching it
. only the opportunity to talk whith the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable
. paulina runs 1
: 28
. the film is in spanish with english subtitles
. it is not rated
but would be an r for violence
and nudity
and would be acceptable for older teenagers
.
