salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days
and many find thsi to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets
. actors who demand such salaries might be greedy
,
but in some instances they are quite justified
, because many films would never be watched or even made wihtout thier participation
. proof for thta can be foudn even in the realm ofthe low
- budget movies
,
and one fine example is breakaway
, 1995 thriller directed by sean dash
annd starring
( in
) famous figure skater tonya harding
. face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie ' s poster
,
but the main star of tghe film is terri thompson who plays myra
, attractive woman who works as a courrier for ganster
. one day she decides to retire
,
but her employers are anything
but enthusiastic about that
. realising that her life suddenly became worthless
, myra starts running for her life
, followed by professional assassins
. terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater
.
although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities
, her acting leaves much to be desired
. on the other hand
, her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place iin thte film that lacks originality
, believable characters
and situations
and actualy represents anything that gave b
- films a bad name
. martin sheen ' s brother joe estevez
, whose character looks like he had entered from another movies ' set
, is the only bright spot of breakaway
. unfortunately
, he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding ' s silver screen debut proved to be her lastest film
.
