a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets
. the film managed to remove all the peotry from the poets
and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities
. the result is mearly an academic exercise
, leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn
' t build on to show them as the poets htey were
. onthe paper
, this shouldn
' t have beeen so terrible
-
- it had a talented director in agnieszka holl
and
(
" the secret garden
"
)
, a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton
( dangerous liaisons
)
,
and a capable casted
.
but the film was done in by its inept script
, the unappealing way the film was directed
,
and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud
. i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film
, with him acting more like a teenage brat thna a young genius
, spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade
. he
, especially
, looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that ws thrust apon him
and how thin a character he was forced to be
. bu when the two of them were together
, it looked like a mismatch
. leonardo
' s rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant
and crude
,
yet we know from rimbaud
' s peotry
, that he must have had something going for him because his poetry wass awe inspiring
. the film opens in post
- revolutionary france in 1871
, the 16
- year
- old rimbaud has sent the estalbished symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems
. he accepts verlaine
' s praises
and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home
,
and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville
. once there
, rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household
, has an immediate conflict with verlaine
' s busty 18
- year
- old wife mathilde
( romane
)
,
and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body
and thgat he lives off her family
' s money
, even
though he has nothing else in common with her
. when verlaine states
,
" poets cant learn ffrom one another
,
" rimbaud replies in a hauty tone
,
" only if they
' re bad poets
.
" he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relatiopnship
. verlaine proves to be weak
- willed
, beating his wife regularly
,
and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud
. when mathilde
' s father kicks rimbaud out of the house
, verlaine finds him in a rooming house
and the two become lovers
. it
' s a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets
, which leads them to traveling together
and mathilde asking for a divorce
. in brussels
, verlaine gets arrested for sodomy
and spends two years in jail
. while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world
and never writes another poem affter he becomes 19
. he instead goes to north africa
and becomes an adventurer
and a gun
- runner
,
and after ten years there
, comes home with a tumor on his knee
and dies a changed man at the age ofthe 37
. the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail
and that ws nto very satisfying
. the film ends on a whimper
.
.
. with verlaine talking with rimbaud
' s sister about her brother
and the peoms ofthe his he still possesses
, which the sister whants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published
. this film was especially annoying because rimbaud
' s poems are filled wih a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film
, as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets
and completely ignores the value of their poetry
. i have noone idae what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film
,
but whatever it was
, it just didn
' t work
. it certainly didn
' t bring any light into underst
anding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry
and why he earned the reputation as the so
- called father of modern poetry
.
