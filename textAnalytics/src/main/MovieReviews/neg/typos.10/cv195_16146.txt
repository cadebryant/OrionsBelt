one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek
, the star of the wb ' s runaway hit dawson ' s creek
. following in the foot steps of mtv ' s two other live action films
, joe ' s apartment
( 1996
)
and dead man on cumpus
( 1998
)
, varsity blues is a bad film
and is unlikely tothe cause much of a sensation in the marketplace
. set in west cannan
, texas
, the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john
" mox
" moxon
( van der beek
)
. we know he ' s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook
. coach bud kilmer
( jon voight
) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him
. the star quarterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, is a handsome
, blonde
, hero who has his own billboard in his front yard
and dates the sexy head cheerleader
, darcy
( ali larter
)
. also on the team are an enormous guy
( ron lester
) with some health problems
and the token african
- american team member
( eliel swinton
) whose only real dialogue scene deals direcly with the color of his skin
. when lance is seriously injured
, mox gets his chance to shine
and he runs with it
, undermining kilmer with his unusual palying strategies
. his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend
, jules
( amy smart
)
, is threatened
and there ' s a big gae at the end
. guess who wins
? nothing about varsity blues is inspired
and the whole film simply moves through the sort of convetional motions that coach kilmer would love
. there ' s a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions
but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow
. van der beek doens a decent job of carrying his first film
althought a silly accent trips him up sometimes
. also
, the role isn ' t very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character
. he ' s still a pseudo
- intellectual
, whiny
, nice guy
, except here he also happens to be a jock
. voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery
adn spits it out
. the other adults are all notabley awful while the younger performers don ' t fare much better
. on the positive side
, walker is a charismatic ator who isnt due for a breakout role following this
and his supporting turn iin pleasantville
( 1998
)
. scott
( son of james
) caan has some lively moments as tweeder
, tghe team ' s wild man
. larter
, as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas
, gets to sohw off the film ' s most interesting costumes
, including a very eye
- oppening
" whipped cream bikini
.
" it ' s interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r
- rating with a lot of harsh language
, alcohol abuse
and an unusually high amount of nudity
( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not vyer surprising surprise
)
. all this is likely to come as a shock tothe the young female fan base ofthe dawson ' s creek
, presumably the target audience for the picture
. director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger
( from nickelodeon films
, a sister company ofthe mtv
)
and changes directions here a bit
but still fails to make much of an impression
. the look of the movie isnt as bland as the town
and characters who populate it
. the football scenes are generally unexciting
and the entire film looks a bit washed out
. there ' s an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul
, foo fighters
, green day
anbd aaliyah
but it ' s not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film
.
