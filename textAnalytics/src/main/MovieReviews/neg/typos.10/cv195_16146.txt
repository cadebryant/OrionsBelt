one of the first films ofthe 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek
, the star of the wb
' s runaway hit dawson
' s creek
. following inaddition the foot steps of mtv
' s two other live acation films
, joe
' s appartment
( 1996
)
and dead man on campus
( 1998
)
, varsity blues is a bad film
and isnt unlikely to cause much of a sensation inthe the marketplace
. set inaddition west cannan
, texas
, the film examines the small town obsession wtih high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john
" mox
" moxon
( van der beek
)
. we know he
' s smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook
. coach bud kilmer
( jon voight
) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him
. the star quarterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, is a h
andsome
, blonde
, hero who has his own billboard in his front yard adn dates the sexy head cheerleader
, darcy
( ali larter
)
. also onthe the team are an enormous guy
( ron lester
) with some health problems
and the token african
- american team member
( eliel swinton
) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin
. when lance is seriously injured
, mox gets his chance to shine
and he runs with it
, undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies
. his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend
, jules
( amy smart
)
, is threatened
and there
' s a big game at the end
. guess who wins
? nothing about varsity blues is inpsired
and tjhe whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love
. there
' s a chance fo some smart satire on small town obsessions
but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow
. van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film
al
though a silly accent trips him up sometimes
. aslo
, the role isn
' t very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character
. he
' s still a pseudo
- intellectual
, whiny
, nice guy
, except here he also happens to be a jock
. voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece ofthe scenery anbd spits it out
. the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don
' t fare much better
. on the positive side
, walker is a charasmatic actor who is due for a breakout role folowing this
and his supporting turn in pleasantville
( 1998
)
. scott
( son of james
) caan has some lively moments as tweeder
, the team
' s wild man
. larter
, as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas
, gets to show off the film
' s most interesting costumes
, including a very eye
- oppening
" whipped cream bikini
.
" it
' s interesting to note that the film definately earns its r
- rating with a lot of harsh language
, alcohol abuse
and an unusually high amount of nudity
( including a gratuitous trip tothe a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise
)
. all this is likely to come as a shock to thte young female fan base of dawson
' s creek
, presumably the target audiance for the picture
. directer brian robbins previously helmed teh kids feature good burger
( from nickelodeon films
, a sister company ofthe mtv
)
and changes directions here a bited
but still fails to make much of an impression
. the look of tyhe movie is as bl
and as the town
and charachters who populate it
. the football scenes are generaly unexciting
and the entire film looks a bit washed out
. there
' s an ok soundtrack featuring music from colelctive soul
, foo fighters
, green day
and aaliyah
but it
' s not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film
.
