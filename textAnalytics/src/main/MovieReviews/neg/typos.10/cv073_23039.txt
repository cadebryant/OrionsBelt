late in down to ytou
, the lead female character
( julia stiles
) states her greatest fear is having an
" artificial conversation
" with her boyfriend
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
. the irony of this statment will not be lost on audiance members who haev not yot walked out
, fallen asleep
, or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy
. the film is a multi
- million dollar testament to everyting artifical
. filled with characters
, motivation
, plot
and dialogue tyhat ring fake
and shallow at eveyr step this is an unquestionable disaster
. prinze plays a coleeg student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles
' freshman co
- ed
. at first the movie seems to be an attempt to string along scenes with the sole purpose of out
- donig the previous in how
" cute
" it can be
. the happy couple
" psychoanalyze
" each other
; they pick outloud a song because
, as prinze
' s dj mother
( lucie arnez
) explains
, every couple needs a song
; he smells her shampoo
; she scratches his chest in the morning to let him know she wants to make love
.
then
, in st
andard romantic comedy style
, things fall apart
. why
? well
, because they have to
. otherwise thge couple can
' t make up
and live
( presumibly
) happily ever after
. down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic
. scenes do not connect to each other
and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism
,
but this isnt h
andled so poorly that everything comes off r
andom
and stupid instead
. a picnic scene involving the six key characters isnt just bizarre
, not onyl for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together
, or even knowing each other
,
but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat
. the supporting charactors are remarkably flat
,
and insultingly ridiculous as well
. stiles
' best friend
( rosario dawson
) is a pot head
, prinze
' s roommate
( shawn hatosy
) is a girl crazy fool who can
' t meet women
, adn
then there are the porn stars
( zak orth
and selma blair
)
. he is one of those famous porn stars who is frequently interviewed on television
, does the college lecture circuit
,
and stars inthe high budget costume epic porns that are shot on film
. you nkow
, the average porn star
. the costume epic idea gives him a reason to appear in a different ridiculous outfit everytime he
' s on screen
, the porn angle exists just so there can be a couple of stupid sex jokes
. she is a porn star mostly so we know she
' s slutty
, so her very existence will make stiles jealous
and prinze tempted
. attempts at drama
( which means julia is going to cry
) include a pregnancy scare
and the big break up
. these characters are so insipid only the most forgiving viewer would be manipulated by these weak scenes
. what happened here
? the cast is full ofthe likable
, promising
, young actors
( stiles especially seems to be oging places
)
. writer
/ director kris isacsson has simply given them material so weak not even seasoned pros could pull it off
. in fact the whole film feels like a reworking ofthe last year
' s extremely unplesant the story of us
, for teen audiences
. thge direction is film
- school
- grad obvious
. it
' s stylish in a hugely self conscious way which throws in splitted screen
, a pointless parody of
" cops
,
" characters walking inot the flashbacks of other characters
,
and a hilariously cheesy airport meeting between prinze
and stiles where all the extras move in fast motion while the couple moves inwhich extreme slow motion
. plus
, the whole story is told flashback style
, narrated by prinze
and stiles direcly addresing the camera
. this is the second film in a row
( following wing comm
ander
) starring freddie prinze jr
. which should have premiered on the aisles of the local blockbuster
but was likely saved from that fate due to the fluke success of she
' s all taht
. if he doesn
' t start making better choices fast his future films won
' t be so lucky
.
