there have been bad films in recent years
:
' mr
. magoo
' was by far the worst ever made
, the spectacularly bad
' blue in the face
'
, the horrible
' baby genuises
'
and now
' i woke up early the day i died
'
. it may not
however be the worst movie made
but it certainly ranks as one bad movie
. the film
' s acting
( if that
' s whta you want to call it
) is well mediocre to me
. loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save teh film a bit
, boy was i wrong
. after escaping from a mental institution
' the thief
' plyed by billy zane goes out in the real world
and finds that it is pretty harsh
and gritty
. he turns to burglary to survive
, robs a loan bakc
, kills the loan officer
and runs with thous
ands
. a country
- wide man hunt is on fo him to catch him
and bring him down
. he ends up inthe a cemetery where he puts his moey in a coffin to keep it for later
, comes back
and realizes that somone took it
and put it somwhere
. now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back
, ultimately leading to a finale that is less taht satisfying
. a film which was based on a
' long
- lost
' script by ed woud
, i have only one question
: no dialogue
, onyl music
and movement where exactlly is the point
? the film moves along at a rather slow pace
,
but does have noe advantage
: the soundtrack whlch is catchy
and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some
. it opens with a fun
, innovative opening credits sequence
and quickly goes downhill after that
. some of the low points are when
' the thief
' steals a woman
' s purse
,
and
then she faints
, s
andra bernhard as a dancer
and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom
' the thief
' kills to the music of
' psycho
'
. come on people get some new ideas already
! what
' s even worse is that teh film has no plot at all
. well to a certain extent it does
,
but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we
' re bored out of our mind
and ready for something fun
and exciting to happen
.
' i woke up early thte day i died
' is a perfectly bad film
. it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie
. even with the huge casted talent
, the film is a waste of my time
and certainly a waste ofthe yours
.
