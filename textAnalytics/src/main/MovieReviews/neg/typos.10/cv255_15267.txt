movies don
' t come much more ridiculously titled than
" i still know what you did last summer
,
"
but since the movie in question is best described as ridiculous
, the title sort ofthe works as a warning
. more than a silly
- sounding mouthful to blurt out to tyhe ticket vendor
, this horror sequel
' s moniker also contains a grievous oversight that anyone who saw the original will be able to spot
: what
" you
" doed
_ last
_ summer
" you
" actually doed the summer
_ before
_ last summer
,
and since
" i
" knew baout it
_ this
_ summer as well as
_ last
_ summer
, it
' s really illogical tothe say that
" i
"
_ still
_ know what
" you
" did
_ last
_ summer
. the filmmakers owudl have at least made sense with the shorter
" i still know
,
" yhe longer
" i still know whta you did two summers ago
" or teh appropriate
" stupid people getting hacked to bits
.
" thgat last suggestion is the preferable one since the characters in this film do things that are tje polar opposite of smart
. for example
, if your roommate is plagued by terrible nightmares as a result of being stalked
and nearly murdered not long ago
, owudl you sneak into her room late at night
and hide in the closet
, even if it was just to locate
and borrow a cute littel dress
? probably not
,
but that
' s precisely what college student karla
( pop diva br
andy
) does to best freind julie
( jennifer love hewitt
)
, resulting in the frist in a long line of phony frights
. julie
, you
' ll recall
, was oen of the sole survivors at tje end of 1997
' s surprise hit
" i know what you did last summer
,
" after a slasher with a grudge to bear
- it
' s a
_ long
_ story
- began trying to pick off her
, her buddies
and various others in their coastal carolina village
. inwhich tihs installment
, the plot picks up as karla wins a trip to the bahamas
,
and julie
, yot racked by guilt
, decides that maybe a tropical getaway will help ease her mind
. yeah
, right
. thier isl
and paradise has room
, of course
, for one more in the form of the still
- alive killer
( muse watson
) from the first film
. he sports the same gorton
' s fisherman get
- up
, a heavy hat
and rain slicker that mask his identity
,
but why he
' s still trying to stay anonymous is a mystery this movie never solves
.
.
.
though i suppose his hook
- h
and would look funny protruding from the sleeve of a leisre suit
. in a sense
, that
' s the movie
' s glaring flwa
- everybody knows who the bad guy is
, thus evaporating the level of paranoid tension nicely sustained by its prequel
. the murders
and attempted murders in that film were vivid
and scary
,
but trey callaway
' s derivative
" i still know
" screenplay makes the fisherman jstu as dumb as his preety potential victims
. when julie lays blissfully unaware in a tanning bed
, giving him a perfect chance to wreak vengeance once
and for all
, what does he do
? he twist
- ties the lid shut
and cranks uv the uv rays
- you
' d thiunk he
' d want her gutted now instead of a skin cancer victim later
. even prequel
" summer
" lovers might balk at how little there is here beyond sporadically amusing absurdity annd a few neat
- o shots of blood flowing from toned teenage flesh
. the innovative gallows humor that scribe
(
and
" scream
" wunderkind
) kevin williamson injected into
" i know
"
' s unfolding stopry is sorely missed
, replaced with the grating antics of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smokes weid anbd tosses off slang like
" yo
"
; you
' ll cheer
- not shriek
- when he ends up with a pair of hedgetrimmers firmly implanted in his chest
. if
" i know what ytou did lastest summer
,
"
however effective
, was just the kind of movie that those subversive
" scream
" flicks poked funn at
,
then thge deadly
" i still know what you did last summer
" deserves a full
- blown roasting on
" mystery science theatre 3000
.
