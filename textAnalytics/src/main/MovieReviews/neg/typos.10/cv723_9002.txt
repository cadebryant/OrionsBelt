chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from
-
- you either fidn his helium voice
, crazy eyes
and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying
. i think i fall into the former category
( i
' m one of the faw who
thought his turn in
" the fifth element
" as a prancing
, prince
- like deejay was complete inspired lunacy
and not the least bited aggravating
)
,
but his new veicle
" money talks
" just doesn
' t do him service
. tucker is good in the movie
-
-
and this is the kind ofthe film that
, if people see it
, could make him a big star
-
-
but he
' s also realyl the only thing good about the movie
. in fact
, if you see
" mony talks
,
" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of
" toy story
"
' s writers penned the sloppy script
. tucker
' s role here is thta of franklin hatchett
, a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative repertwar james russell
( charlie sheen
)
. after being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports
, franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail
and h
andcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard
( gerard ismael
)
.
but villard
' s thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader
( never mind that the explosion could have instade killed him
)
,
and beacuse he
and franklin are joined at the wrist
, franklin is allowed to escape as well
,
but not before overhearing some importan information regarding a diamond stash taht
-
- for some reason or another
-
- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting tothe be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo
. the local media mistakenly puts the prison break
- out blame on franklin
, which is where james comes back into the picture
. he makes a dael to protect franklin if
, in turn
, franklin gives him an exclusive interview
. this means james must present his newyorker
" freind
" in the stickiest of situations
-
- a formal dinner party for he
and fiancee grace
( heather locklear
)
, alsot attended by her uber
- rich parents
( veronica cartwright
and nicely game paul sorvino
)
.
and of course the bad guys trac franklin down adn try to knock him off
, all the hwile he spars
and forms an unlikely bond with james
.
" this ain
' t no buddy movie
,
" claim the print ads
. yeah
, right
. actually
, for the better part of
, oh
, 20 minutes
, it appears
" moey talks
" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground
, annd this is mostly due tothe the presence of spastic motormouth tucker
. this is tucker
' s first leading role
,
and if you imagin a slightly lankier
, african
- american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r
- rated raunch rather than pg
- 13 physical comedy
, you hvae a ogod idea of yhe conviction with which he assaults the role
.
but you realize all too quickly that tucker
' s overstated liveliness is the only thing
" money talks
" has going for it
.
and a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make
. it
' s all too easy to pick out everything wrong with
" money talks
.
" the plot is recycled buddy
- buddy comedy
- thriller tripe that seemed overused even when
" nothing to lose
" employed it last month
. everything is paint
- by
- numbers
, especially the los angeles coliseum finale
, which finds not one
, not two
,
but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers
. the villains
, as many as there are
, are dull
. certain story elements are too coincidental
.
and too much of the film
' s dramatic agenda is played too straight
. a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin
' s true idenity
(
" you brought a killer into my parents
' house
!
"
) is extremely silly
. you git the picture
. obviously
, i did not have a pleasant experience at
" money talks
.
"
but the people around me appeared to be having a rip
- roaring good time
( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health
)
.
but tucker
, at least for me
, is a pretty funny guy
,
and aces the movei
' s best scene
, where franklin passes himself off as vic damone
' s son at james
and grace
' s engagement bash
and toasts the cuple with barry white lyrics
. tucker
' s audience
-
- adn he does have one
-
- will probaly liuke
" money talks
.
" those who he irritates
,
however
, wiull have a more productive day staying home
and scraping the gook out from under their toenails
.
