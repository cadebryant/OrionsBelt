ever watch a very young child try anbd tell a joke that is beyond his
, or her
, sophistication
? it
' s full of stops
and starts
and usually
, the punch line is ruined
. i felt the same way watching drowning mona
. skip a stone across water
and you approximate the depth of tihs attempt at an ensemble comedy
. there are some slightly successful attempts at humor
, bu they only serve as window dressing
. there is a running gag about the town
, verplanck
, n
. y
.
, being a test town for the
then new yugo
. everyone drives a yugo
, differentiating their cars with personalized license plates
. even the police chief drives one
. there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights
and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets
. there also is a running gag about one of thte characters
, jeff
, missing a h
and
and how it occurred
. it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends
. it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend
. there are some sight gags that pop up as well
, such as mona
' s tombstone
, which reads
" demoted
"
, instead of devoted
. still
, the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond
. the lynchpin of the film falls on tje redundant
and sporadic scenes involving mona
( midler
)
. each scene with her isnt tje same
: scream at someone
, hit someone
,
then scream some more
. there
' s no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness
. anyone off the street could have played the role
, such as it is
. the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts
. each one is defined by one trait annd no further attempt is made at deeper characterization
. there is a burly
, female car mechanic
, so of course
, there is a forced lesbianism gag
. mona
' s son
, jeff
( marcus thomas
) is a simpleton
, hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth
. chief of police rash
( devito
) likes broadway musicals
and loves his daughter
. there
' s nothing more to him
. elle
, the chief
' s daughter
( campbell
)
, is bl
and personified
, a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child
and be married
. mona
' s husb
and phil
( fichtner
) jeckle
and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch
. bob
( affleck
)
, elle
' s betrothed
,
and business partner to jeff
, isnt a mumbling
, obvious dullard
. ther is no contrast to any of the characters
. by having at least one character with some wit
, or wits
, to serve as counterpoint to tyhe others
, perhaps steinfeld
' s attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better
. ostensibly a murder mystery
, drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immidiately
,
then lets you sit back
and feel superior as you watch the cast ofthe paper people fumble their way to finding the killer
, who could be anyone due to mona
' s loving manner with everyone on town
. even that aspect of yhe film fails
, throwing in a convenient
, ridiculous
and unsatisfying wrap to things
. it
' s been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood
. what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarley remember a comedy mkaing me so angry for wasting my time at it
' s ineptitude
.
