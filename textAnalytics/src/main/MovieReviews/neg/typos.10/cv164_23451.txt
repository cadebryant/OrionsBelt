ever watch a very young child try
and tell a joke that is beyond his
, or her
, sophistication
? it ' s full of stops
and starts
and usually
, the punch line is ruined
. i felt teh same way watching drowning mona
. skip a stone across water
and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy
. there are some slightly successful attempts at humor
,
but they only serve as window dressing
. there is a running gag about the twon
, verplanck
, n
. y
.
, being a test twon for the
then new yugo
. everyone drives a yugo
, differentiating their cars with personalized license plates
. even the polical chief drives one
. htere is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights
adn siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the twon streets
. there also is a running gag about one of the characters
, jeff
, missing a hand
annd how it occurred
. it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends
. it turns out the truth isnt mroe horrifying than any legend
. there are some sight gags that pop up as well
, such as mona ' s tombstone
, which reads
" demoted
"
, instead of devoted
. still
, the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond
. the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant
and sporadic scenes involving mona
( midler
)
. each scene with her is the same
: scream at someone
, hit someone
,
then scream some moreso
. there ' s no uniqueness or modulation tothe her or explanation for her meanness
. anyone off the street could have played the role
, such as it is
. the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts
. each one is defined by one trait
and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization
. there is a burly
, female car mechanic
, so of course
, there is a forced lesbianism gag
. mona ' s son
, jeff
( marcus thomas
) is a simpleton
, hence you can predict his dialogue befoer it even plods its way from his mouth
. chief of police rash
( devito
) likes broadway musicals
and loves his daughter
. there ' s nothing more to him
. elle
, the chief ' s daughter
( campbell
)
, is bland personified
, a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child
and be married
. mona ' s husband phil
( fichtner
) jeckle
adn hydes fomr shirking coward to reptilian letch
. bob
( affleck
)
, elle ' s betrothed
,
and business partner to jeff
, is a mumbling
, obvious dullard
. there is no contrast to any of the characters
. by having at least one character with some wit
, or wits
, to serve as counterpoint to the others
, perhaps steinfeld ' s attempt at satirizing a small town infested wtih ambitionless peple might have come off better
. ostensibly a murder mystery
, drowning mona gives yuo almost all the clues immediately
,
then lets you sit back
and feel superior as yuo watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding tjhe killer
, who could be anyone due to mona ' s loving manner with everyone on town
. even that aspect of the film fails
, throwing in a convenient
, ridiculous
and unsatisfying wrap tothe things
. it ' s been a while since i walked away from a movie theather in an angry mood
. what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it ' s ineptitude
.
