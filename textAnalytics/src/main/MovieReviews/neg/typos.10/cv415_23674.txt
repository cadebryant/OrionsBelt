it
' s been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci
- fi opus
` mission tothe mars
'
,
and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar
. why
? the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye c
andy
, stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera
, instead shooting for the ngle of a feel
- good science fiction drama more akin to
` 2001
: a space odyssey
'
. i got tyhe feeling that most of my fellow movie
- gonig patrons weere expecting anohter
` armageddon
'
.
but no
,
` mission to mars
' certainly isn
' t one large action sequence about colossal disaster
. this isnt a supposedly
thoughtful
, familiy
- friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance
and uplifting drivel
. you have been warned
. ofthe course
, crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible
( see
` apollo 13
' for an excellent example
)
,
but few directors possess the skill
and craftsmanship to pul it off without seriously scarring their reputation
. brian de palma has enough directorial expertise
and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off
. when he gets his h
ands on an intelligent
, systematically practical script like
` the untouchables
' or
` mission
: impossible
'
, the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement
( altho his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome mroe than occasionally
)
. of course
, htere
' s also the inexcusable string ofthe crap that has carried his name
( incuding
` snake eyes
'
and the notorious bomb
` the bonfire of the vanities
'
)
.
.
.
. all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood
. that term may be too harsh
, bu if i were judging him solely onthe the perpetual waste of talent that is
` mission to mars
'
, my choice of words would have beeen slightly less lenient
. if i were gary sinise
, i wouldn
' t touch de palma with a 10
- foot pole
. sinise is a wonderful
, wonderful actor
,
but after appearing in
` snake eyes
'
and this vomit
- inducing sham
, i
' m sure he wouldn
' t want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration
. the academy award
- winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell
, a man who recently lost his wife
( kim delaney
)
and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcomming space shuttle mission to mars
( oops
, forgot to mention the year
- 2020
)
. after a barbecue get
- together for the astronauts
, we cut to luc goddard
( don cheadle
)
and his team
, who are already tkaing measurements
and calculations onthe tghe red planet
. suddenly
, a towering formation of rocks
and soil
- probably best dubbed a
` s
and tornado
'
- appears
and creates a whirlwind of suction
. for smoe reason
, the astronauts just st
and there calmly to admire this
, as if it were a lovely piece of art
. the team is killed within seconds
, expect for luc
, who was able to send one final transmission
and may still be alive
. emmediately
, a second mission
- consisting of astronauts mcconnell
, husb
and
and wife woody
and terri blake
( tim robbins
and connie nielsen
)
and phil ohlmyer
( jerry o
' connell
)
- are dispatched to rescue luc
and discover the mysterious secert of planet mars
. let
' s put the
` secret
' on hold for now
,
and discuss the trip ther
. it is explained
, whether scientifically accurate or not
( probably not
)
, thta a trip to mars takes roughly six monthes
. i
' m not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind
` m2m
' didn
' t capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension
and claustrophobia
. instead
, we join the team during their final days aboard the ship
. what happened during the five months prior to this
? did they just play cards
and tell dirty jokes
? still
, there are faw nicely tense moments
( maeby the onyl in the movie
) during the time
- frame involving a fuel leak
. depalma
' s direction is quite good in these scenes
,
al
though the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent
( organ music in space
? c
' mon
)
. there
' s a few ogod
, imaginative ideas in the l
andslide of cheese
, a sad realization tht causes me to sigh out loud
. it
' s a colossal bummer that
` mission to mars
' is poorly assembled
and laughably written
, wtih a dubious
and supremely silly finale that iwll onyl satisfy dedicated optimists
. as mentioned before
, anyone looking for some disaster
- movei carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed
.
.
. maybe even cheated
. after thte unbelievably hokey final shooted
( with the words
? the end
' somehow adding insult to injury
)
, a faw audience members made the affort to boo
and hiss at the screen
. others muttered obscenities
, shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling
` jeez
, taht sucked
.
' okay
, it doed suck
. bu yuo have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy
.
.
. after all
, htey do pretty well
. sinise is sincere
and effective in many of his scenes
, robbins
and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple
,
and funnyman o
' connell
- well
, he has a couple lines are ctually amusing
(
and intentionally so
)
. the digital effects accompanying tjhe s
and tornado sequence are qutie impressive
. so
, by golly
, where did this
` mission
' go wrong
? looking back on the appalling experience
, i would say in practically every conduit adn crevasse it coudl hvea
. while watching
` mission to mars
'
, my suggestion would be to immediately abort
, or better
yet
, don
' t even strap yourself in for lift
- off
.
