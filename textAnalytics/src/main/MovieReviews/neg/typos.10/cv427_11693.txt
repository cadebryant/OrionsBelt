" m
andingo
" has traditionally been seen as one ofthe two things
: either a much
- needed revisionist look at slavery in the south
, or in the words of film critic leonard maltin
,
" a trashy potboiler
" thta
" appeals only to the s
& m crowd
.
" actually
, i think
" m
andingo
" is a stange combination of thge two
,
al
though it fails on both fronts
. it
' s too trashy tothe be good drama
,
but too dramatic to be good trash
. the story takes place on a delapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell
( james mason
)
and his son
, hammond
( perry king
)
. one day in new orleans
, hammond comes accros a slave trader selling a m
andingo named mede
( heavyweight boxer ken norton
)
.
al
though the movei never explains it
, a m
andingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river vallay
. according to the movie
, m
andingos were the rolls royce of african slaves
. hammond pays top price for mede
and has to fight off others in order to get him
. hammond
then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves
. meanwhile
, hammond has marryied his cousin
, blanche
( susan george
)
, because she wants to escape her family
and he is under pressure from his father to produce a gr
andchild
. hammond
,
however
, is happier spending nights whith his
" bed wench
,
" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex
. it is quickly apparent that hammond
, despite his overt racism
, is omre in love with his bed wench
, a sensitive slave girl named ellen
( brenda sykes
)
, than he is with blanche
. hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that anyother man had
" pleasured
" her before he did
. of course
, it
' s fine that he
' s slept with numerous slave girls
,
but the fact thyat his wife
, a
" white lady
,
" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her
. so blanche is usually left lonely
and sex
- starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen
. blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede
and bearing his child
. hammond
and his father cannot st
and the idea that blanche has given birth to a half
- black child
(
al
though it
' s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond
)
, so warren kills the child by letting it bleed tothe death after birth
,
and hammond poisons blanche
. hammond
then finds mede
, shoots him twice in the shoulder
,
and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water
. yes
, you read right
: the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive
. judging only by the plot
,
" m
andingo
" is pure sexploitation
. the main purpose ofthe the film seems to be getting as many blacks
and whites inot bed together as possible
, with only the slightest commentary on what that woudl mean in 19th century southern society
. when
" m
andingo
" was released in 1975
, it wass still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen inwhich such a graphic detail
; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences ofthe curious voyeurs
. dramatically
,
" m
andingo
" is weak
and unfocused
, annd historically it
' s mostly confused
. if one were tothe judge history by this film
, it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality
, nto economics
. nto once in the film do we see any of the slaves wokring
, except for a few house servants
. the men spend most of the time sitting arund
, while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner
. ther is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with thier female slaves
,
but
" m
andingo
' s
" overwhelming empahsis on this aspect ofthe slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste ofthe a cheap sex flick
(
al
though there
' s plenty of violence
-
- fights
, vicious beatings
, shootings
,
and thge aforementioned human boiling sequence
-
- thrown in for good measure
)
. some tried to write off
" m
andingo
" as a blaxploitation film
, one of a number of quickly
- made
, low
- budget films appealling tothe black sensibilities in the eary seventies
,
but it
' s not thta eazy
.
" m
andingo
" was studio
- financed by paramount pictures
,
and produced by dino de laurentiis
, the gr
andiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as
" the bible
"
( 1966
)
, the remake of
" king kong
"
( 1976
)
,
and the ill
- fated
" dune
"
( 1984
)
. tjhe director ws richard fleischer
, a veteran who was best known forthe sevral special effects
- laden action movies includng
" 20
, 000 leagues under the sea
"
( 1954
)
and
" fantastic voyage
"
( 1966
)
, as well as such superior suspense films as
" the narrow margin
"
( 1952
)
. the script
, based on the supermarket best
- seller by ken ostott
(
and tyhe subsequent play by jack kirkl
and
)
, wass penned by norman wexler
, who had been nominated for an oscar two yeras earlier for his work on
" serpico
.
" james mason
, perry king
,
and susan george were well
- known
and respected actors
( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt
)
,
and ken norton appeared to have a promising film carreer
. so why is
" m
andingo
" so bad
? a number of reasons
, including teh fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind annd in front of the camera did a lousy job
. wexler
' s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive
; it combines stereotyped slave
- talk
(
" yessuh
, massuh
"
)
, stereotyped southern white trash talk
(
" fer whut
' re you gittin
' outta bed
?
"
)
,
and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk
(
" if you see me hang
, ytou gonna know you killed a black brother
!
"
)
. fleischer
' s direction is clumsy
, especially durig the fight scenes
,
and all the actors give weak performances
, especially susan george whose constant shrieking fianlly becomes laughable
. nevertheless
, credit should be given where credit is due
. despite its exploitative nature
,
" m
andingo
" was noe of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery
. until
then
, there had been a kind of underlaying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery
. even classics such as
" gone with the wind
"
( 1939
) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over tyhe subject matter
.
" m
andingo
" reassessed the south
,
and showed that it wasn
' t all beautiful plantations
, green fields
,
and pretty sunsets
.
but all this is constantly undermined by the film
' s negligible point
- ofthe
- view
-
- it claims to see things from the black perspective
,
but the entire narrative focus is on yhe soap opera tales of the white owners
. with a little more maturity
and different h
andling
,
" m
andingo
" might have beeen an effective
, worthwhile film
. while it portrays many sensitive spects of slavery
, it never deals with them
. tjhe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile
,
but wexler
' s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing
. there is a gerat dael ofthe potential inthe honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave
and owner
,
but
" m
andingo
" never does it
. steven spielberg touched on that smae topic in
" schindler
' s list
"
( 1993
)
, by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid
. the difference between that film
and
" m
andingo
" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair
, unexploitive manner that focused on the inherrent human dilemma
.
" m
andingo
" is satisfied to simply show some skin
,
and beacuse ofthe that
, its
" trashy potboiler
" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished
.
