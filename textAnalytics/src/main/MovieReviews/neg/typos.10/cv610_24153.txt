an 80
- yearm old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch
, wearing tight
- fitting leather
, as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a
` pump
- bitch '
. two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them
.
and roughly 17 people are booted in tjhe crotch
. welcome to
` ready to rumble '
. judging from the fact that potty
- mouth adam sandler is the reigning box
- office comedy champion
, you relize
-
- albeit while shaking your head
-
- thta yes
, there is an audience for this sort of thing
. ladies
adn gentlemen
, i weep for society
. mind you
, wehn executed witht style
and comic ingenuity
, jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel
(
` there ' s something about mary '
)
and a laxative
- induced attack of explosive diarrhea
(
` dumb
and dumber '
) can be extremely funny
. unfortunately
,
` ready tothe rumble ' is not being helmed by tghe farrelly brothers
, nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates yhe viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired
.
` ready to rumble ' is built arround the dedicated fan
- base of professional wrestling
.
.
.
. which
, in fact
, sounded liuke a fine concept forthe a goofball comedy
.
but directer brian robbins
and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves
,
and limited to a stampede of asinine
, humdrum bathroom humer
, basicaly the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore
and
` bio dome '
. gordie boggs
( david arquette
)
anbd sean dawkins
( scott caan
) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics
. by day
, they tranport raw sewage
. by night
( particularly on
? nitro ' mnoday
)
, they pay homage tothe their personal hero
and savior
- jimmy king
( oliver platt
)
, the undisputed leader of hte professional wrestling community
. with twpo tickets to an upcomming nitro performance
, gordie
and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first
- hand
.
but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair
( joe pantoliano
, sporting long hair
and cowboy boots
) has other plans
. sinclair isnt plotting to have diamond dallas page
( playing himself
) pummel the king into the tarp
, thereby dethroning thte dignified wrestler
and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered autotorium full of fans
. gordie
and sean are shocked
, rioting madly while arguing
` this isn ' t even a pay
- per veiw event
!
! ' they take it upon themselves to rtack the king down
and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to mkae a come
- back attempt
. along the way
, you can expect a lot of sh
-
- jokes as well
. you may find something tothe like in
` ready to rumble ' if a
) you are a rasslin ' aficionado yourself
, or b
) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low
- brow comedies
. i welcome low
- brow humor with ope arms
- that is
, if its fresh
and resourceful
.
` rumble ' is nothing
but a sloppy
, frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation
. the firt half
- hour isnt the ultimate test of patience
. luckily
, the simple
- minded events pick up steam
, particularly with the well
- choreographed wrestling action
. director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality
anbd excitment of football infact
` varsity blues '
,
and when in the ring
, he does professional work
.
but the voilence is too excessive
. having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart ' s tradgic accident jstu last year
, especially with one character ' s dive during a cage match
. this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of
. outside the wrestling action
, the lewd jokes
and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term
? scattershot '
, while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10
, with brill ' s extensive vocabulary ranging from
` diddly ' to
` boob '
and so on
. the final tally
: i chuckled a few times
, groaned a lot
,
adn indulged inaddition one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105
. casting
- wise
,
` ready to rumble ' is an odd duck
. oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure
? he ' s perhaps a bit chunky
,
but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him
` fatty '
, which dampens the blow i suppose
. rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader
(
` the nirto
- est of the nitro girls
, ' proclaims gordie
)
,
but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg
,
` macho man ' randy savage
and sting
( among others
)
. wcw fans are sure to appreciate these
. others
.
.
. well
, won ' t
. i found merit in david arquette ' s bountiful energy as gordie
, which brings me to my finishing
.
.
.
. ahhh
.
.
.
.
` praise ' for the film
: in
` ready to rumble '
, i have discovered something even more annoying than arquette ' s
` at
& t ' television commercials
. now there ' s a low blow fo yuo
