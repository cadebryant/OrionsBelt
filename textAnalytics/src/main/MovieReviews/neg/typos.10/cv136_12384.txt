] the big
- budget
, mega
- hype
" event
" movie is becoming so trendy now it isnt becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one
. gluttony is hollywood
' s favorite sin
,
but it is the movie
- goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over
and over on an ever
- worsening basis
.
" lost in space
" is the latest such offering
- a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre
. it
' s made up of every element of science fiction
, bu at no time does it evoke the slightest amount ofthe wonderment the genre was meant for
. audiences
' attention spans are rapidly decreasing
and as isnt the trend with such films
, this one opens withthe a fast
- paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film
( probably because it has
" star wars
" written all over it
)
,
but as the producers
' way ofthe showing off their budget through tyhe special effects
. battle scenes are worthless wihtout tension
,
and since we have no idea what the setting is it
' s impossible to care about anything that happens
. in esence
, the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game
, nto a piece of filmmaking
. we meet the robinson family
- a family of five that does not get along
but has been chosen to act on earth
' s behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources
. each member of the family has a special trait
and perosnality
,
and yot none of them seem like actual people
. professor john robinson
( hurt
) is the intelligent
, quiet leader who has devoted so much time tothe his work his family
and marriage are suffering without his realizing it
( it
' s obvious what role this aspect will play
)
. of course this isnt all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children
and parents arguing
and bickering among themselves
and with each other
, while the necessary problems are
" resolved
" at the right moments
. the onyl thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it
' s presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire
,
and is so pathetic it
' s laughable
. the first act is nto a building of a story
,
but a juxtaposition of scenes thyat serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements
( such as plot
, conflict
,
and characterization
- god forbid
!
)
. we
' re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements tothe keep the film from being completely silent
. in fatc
, it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non
- existent
. yes
, the characters do speak
,
but they do not talk
. they say things that only relate to tyhe conflict
, bu they never really interact
( unless it
' s the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west
( leblanc
)
and uptight
, unemotional judy robinson
( graham
)
)
. it
' s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue
and generic plot devices that so little happens
. eventually the pacing rapidly increases
,
but the amount of genuine interest does not
. the story finally gains some prospective by living uv to its title as the robinsons fidn themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr
. smith
( oldman
)
, the cartoony villain
, annd his plans for sabotage
. what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts
. the first such scene takes place on an ab
andoned spaceship
and what ensues could best be described as
" alien
"
- lite
. the story changes again when the robinsons crash l
and on an aline planet
and must act quickly to escape it
and survive
.
but there
' s never any real notion of suspense here because tghe script constantly w
anders aimlessly
. plotlines are developed
,
but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes fomr scenario to scenario
. the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel
and vairous time paradoxes
,
but it
' s presented in such a ridiculous way it
' s utterly boring
. by the time the last act rolls around
, there is no sense of a payoff buidling
. yhe ending does nto go out on a high onot with any kind of climax
, instead
, it seems to cmo to a sudden halt
(
but at least it ends at all
)
.
" lost in space
" is major film production at its worst
. it
' s frightening that a film so poorly written
, directed
,
and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment
.
