movies based on video games
, such as street fighter or mario bros
.
, have never generated much interest at the box office
.
bu when the first mortal kombat movie cameback out in 1995
, it did suprisingly well
. with a simple stor
, a pulsating sountrack
,
and lots ofthe awesomely choreographed fight scenes
, the movei moved quickly
and displayed lots of energy
. it got my vote for ' hte movie where i expected the least
and got the most '
.
and
, if you haven ' t had the opportunity
, i would definitely recommend thgat you see it on video
. in the world of mortal kombat
, based on the popular arcade game
, dark forces from outworld try tothe infiltrate earth ' s realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest
and the desctruction of humanity
. the mortal kombat refers to a competition
, fought by human mortals against outworld ' s minions
, which if won
, will guarantee earth ' s safety for anohter generation
. mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition
. despite thier victory
,
however
, a gateway hasnt somehow opened
,
and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth
. outworld ' s warriors include an impressive collection of fighters
, including shao kahn
, mintoro
( a centaur
)
, sheeva
( a four
- armed ogre
)
,
annd sindel
. earth ' s mortal warriors
, under the leadership of the benevolent god
, lord rayden
, includes liu kang
, princess kitana
, sonya blade
and jax
, who must fight against outworld ' s forces
. it ' s an easy enough premise
,
but unfortunately
( very unfortunately
)
, the writers try to do too much with the movie
. it is only a video game
, after all
,
but the on
- screen version tries to go beyond it ' s comic book boundaries by adding depth
, a conceptualization of self
- worth
,
and worst of all
, a loev story
. this becomes very awkward
, because all of the players are fighters
and nothing more
. they are likable
and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts
and fighting skills
,
but look extremely awkward
adn uncomfortable when they are required to actually act
. this becomes embarrassingly apparent
, for example
, as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang
and princess kitana
. the original mk wass smart in letting the players dont what they do best
. they spoke little
,
but fought a lot
. thus
, the movie was easy to digest
.
however
, mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth
, an element that was lacking in the first movie
,
but the attempt here fails miserably
. this uneasy feeling is readily apparent
, fo example
, whenever you hear lord rayden speak
. not only does he talk inwhich riddles
and offer enigmatic
( e
. g
. useless
) advice
,
but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom
. try reading this half as fast
,
and you ' ll hear what i mean
.
but the movie is not a complete fatality
. fight scenes are well
- choreographed
, highlighted by terrific acrobatics
and agility
.
and players of the gameboy will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every charater from the video game
,
although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo
. even if you ' re not familiar with the video game
, each fighter hasnt their own costume
and unique weaponry tothe easily differentiate themselves
.
but it ' s just too little of whta movie
- goers
and especially fans of the game will expect
. oddly
, tyhe inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence
.
and the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival
.
( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom
)
. rent the first one
,
but the sequel is for kombat fans only
.
