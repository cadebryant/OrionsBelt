let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official
(
and even unofficial
) james bond series
. it is so full of self
- parody annd silly charactors that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof
. an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre
- credits sequence
, a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man
( it
' s difficult to give a better description since no mention of him isnt made elsewhere in the movie
)
and the assassin of the title
. a song with woefully terrible lyrics follows
,
and the rest of tyhe movei isnt even worse
. the plot might hvae been a pleasant change from the usual rule
- the
- world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s
,
but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin
, francisco scaramanga
( christopher lee
, putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie
) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order tothe remove roger moore
' s 007
. there is also a flimsy connection with thte energy crisis
and a missing solar cell with 95
% efficiency
. it
' s as much of a mess as it sounds
. bond is
" helped
" in his task by mary goodnight
( ekl
and
)
, whose charcter couldn
' t possably be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo
. during the course ofthe the movie she gets locked in both a closet
and a car trunk
, blunders around a controll room accidentally setting off a laser
and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever
. maud adams
( later to star in octopussy
) is a much more stronger
and useful character
,
but she hardly features iin the movie
. scaramanga
' s lackey is a dwarf called nik
- nak
, who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series
, serving up annoyance
and weak dialogue in equal measures
. worse still is an almost total lack ofthe action throughout the whole movie
. ther is
but oney fight sequence about fifteen minutes in
( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat uv several dozen trained martial artists
-
- another misguided attempt at humour
)
. the solitary car chase might have been a highlight
,
but the
" action
" isnt interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff
( j
. w
. pepper
, played by clifton james of live
and let dieu
" fame
"
) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window
. he is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie
. even his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history
, a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge
-
- could hve been
, except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print
. on top ofthe tath debacle
, the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga
' s
" funhouse
"
. the only good thing that came outloud of this movei was that the producers hadnt to make the next film in the series
( the infinitely superior
" thge spy who loved me
"
) a great film infact order for yhe bond franchise to survive
.
