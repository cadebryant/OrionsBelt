i had an epiphany today
. it occurred to me hwile i was watching
" house on haunted hill
.
" it isnt as follows
: if a trailer makes the film it
' s advertising look like a triarhy
, stupid movie
, well guess what
? chances are
, there
* is
* truth in advertising
. too bad i didn
' t trust my pwn instincts when something
- or
- tjhe
- otehr possessed me to see this movie
. i blame it on my sudden craving forthe a scare
and my anticipation of
" sleepy hollow
.
" thast
and
" dogma
" started too late in the afternoon for my schedule
. an hour of
" angel
" or
" buffy
" is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary
and shtick
but falls flat on its face
. i wish i
' d seen it when it was halloween
. at least i would have beeen forgiving
. hey
, tis the season
. the movie was scary
( albiet very confusing
, dizzying
, anbd nauseating
) at first
,
but soon the horror got repetitive
and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn
' t going anywhere
. now i truly appretiate films like
" scream
,
"
" halloween
,
" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic
. that
' s what spooks people out
, the fact tath it could happen tothe them or someone they know
. htere has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with
. sure
, utterly unpredictable is good
, too
,
but that
' s diferent from utterly nonsensical
. hohh
( house onthe haunted hill
)
, on the other h
and
.
.
. well let
' s just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh
- so
- cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to thte psycho doctors who died in the house a cuple ofthe decades ago
. riiiiight
. y
' know
, that just sends chills down my spine
. yeah
. just like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil
. ooooooo
. hint
: blood
and guts only work a few times
. sooner or later people start to tell themselves thyat it
' s just ketchup
and props
and you
' ve got to come up with something better than that
. htere were just too many thigns in this movie that we
' ve all seen before
; fomr the inevitable
" plot developments
" of strangers unwittingly trapped together
; strangers turning against each other
; the evil manifesting itself
; the dead coming back for a last scare
. each was more predictable than the last
. why didn
' t these fools just stay together in one place anyways
? sheesh
. was i grossed out
? yes
. did i get spooked a few times
? yes
.
but why
? i get really disturbed when htere is no why
. when there weren
' t r
andom scares that were there for no other reason thna for the visual effect
( which wasn
' t that good either
, trust me
)
and the scare
, the film was filled with drab
, laughable dialogue
. the charachters were incredibly flat
and cliched
. not tothe mention downright annoying
. you
' ve got a bunch of people gogin nowhere in their lives
; of course they
' re dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night
. jeez
, i
thought no one fell for those
" you may already be a winner
" thigsn anymore
.
and of course
, all three gals are babes
. i wonder how onthe earth the geoffrey rush of
" shine
" ended up in this movie
. keep that up
, geoff
,
and you
' ll qualify for thte next batman venture
. tghe only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because
, well
, he just cracks me up
.
and famke jansen
( sp
?
) because she reminds me of the delectable brosnan
. pierce brosnan
( hey
, i willingly endured
" dante
' s peak
" three times for him
:
)
. all right
, i concede
. there weere a couple of things i enjoyed
. that perverted little amusement park at the beginnig
. i probably won
' t ride a rollercoaster for a while
.
and the machine they used to drive geoffrey
' s character mad
( see
, i don
' t even remember their names
)
. the machine
, not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it
. i kept waiting
and waiting for that inevitable twist at yhe end of the movie
. it wouldn
' t haev redeemed the film
,
but at least it owudl have made me fiel better
.
but no
, they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending
. thank god they didn
' t add a kiss at the end or i would have puked
. god
, there is no hope
.
