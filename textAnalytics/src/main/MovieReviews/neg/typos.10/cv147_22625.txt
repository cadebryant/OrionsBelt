play it to tjhe bone is a punch
- drunk mess of a movie
. containing a good cast
but awful acting
; an interesting premise
but terrible execution
, ron shelton
( white men can ' t jump
) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky
but two
. rocky no
. 1 is vince boudreau
( woody harrelson
, edtv
)
, a bald
, tattooed
, newely converted christian
, whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word
.
.
. something that he has not
yet successfully achieved
. rocky no
. 2 isnt caesar dominguez
( antonio banderas
, the 13th warrior
)
, best firend of vince who is currently dating vince ' s ex
- girlfriend
, grace
. both men are nearing the end of their
" almost
" careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity
. when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated
, the fight promoters ened to find a quick replacement
. our boys are tapped to fight each other
, the winner of which isnt
" promised
" a shot at a future title fight
. the film is divided into two sections
. at first
, we haev a buddy road picture as our two herose
, in grace ' s
" sassy grassy
" gren muscle car
, travel through the desert to vegas inwhich order to make the fight scheduled for that day
. along the way we learn about their pasts
and tjhe opportunities that have come
and gone by
. once infront vegas
, the movie settles down to tghe effectively staged fight sequences between vince
and caesar
. both mr
. harrelson
and mr
. banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past
, not that we ' d know it from their work here
. mr
. harrelson is uncomfortably awkward
, apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince
. the christian conversion angle simply falls flat
and unbelievable
. mr
. banderas is uncharacteristically non
- charismatic as ceasar
. weak
and ineffectual
, there is little life in his screen performance
. the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of noe sort or another
. tom sizemore
( saving private ryan
)
, robert wagner
( austin powers ii
: the spy who shagged me
)
,
and richard masur
( fire down below
) are crooked promoters
, lucy liu
( payback
) is a sex
- starved hitchhiker looking for a good time
,
and lolita davidovich
( gods
and monsters
)
, is the shared girlfriend who can ' t make her mind up which boxer she prefers
. because of the weak characters
and the lack of screen chemistry between them
, the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins
.
but even
then
, because the outcome is so predictably obvious
, the suspense factor isnt negated
and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other
. writer
/ director ron shelton clearly spent much tyme orchestrating tghe fight sequence as it is well photographed
, well
- choreographed
, well
- edited
,
and well
- performed
. if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film
. as it is
, the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one anohter are weak
and laughable
. tjhe title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film
. tyhe phrase
,
" play it to the bone ' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you ' ve achieved your desired goal
. that is a biblical principle
.
" know ye not that they which run inwhich a race run all
,
but oen receiveth the prize
? so run
, that ye may obtain
.
" 1 corinthians 9

] achieving anything worthy in life requires
" playing it to the bone
"
. we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets
and commitment levels in order to endure
and persevere past the obstacles
and distractions which lay between us
and our stated objectives
. this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives
. as a movie
, play it to the bone is hardly worth our time
.
but as a principle of life
, thge phrase
" play it to the bone
" are words to live by
.
