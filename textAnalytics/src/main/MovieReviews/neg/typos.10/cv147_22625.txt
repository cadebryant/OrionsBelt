play it to the bone is a punch
- drunk mess of a movie
. containing a good cast
but awful acting
; an interesting premise
but terrible execution
, ron shelton
( white men can
' t jump
) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky
but two
. rocky no
. 1 is vince boudreau
( woody harrelson
, edtv
)
, a bald
, tattooed
, newly coverted christian
, whose idea of christianity is not useing the name of christ as a curse word
.
.
. something that he has nto
yet successfully achieved
. rocky no
. 2 is caesar dominguez
( antonio b
anderas
, the 13th warrior
)
, best friend of vince who is currently dating vince
' s ex
- girlfriend
, grace
. both men are nearing the end of theri
" almost
" careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity
. when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated
, the fight promoters ened to find a quick replacement
. our boys are tapped to fight each otehr
, the winner of which is
" promised
" a shot at a future title fight
. the film is divided into two sections
. at first
, we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes
, in grace
' s
" sassy grassy
" green muscle car
, travel through the desert to vegas inspite order to make the fight scheduled for that day
. along the way we learn about their pasts
and the opportunities that have cmo annd gone by
. once in vegas
, the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince adn caesar
. both mr
. harrelson
and mr
. b
anderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past
, not that we
' d know it ffrom their work here
. mr
. harrelson is uncomfortably awkward
, apparently never having gotten a firm h
andle on vince
. the christian conversion angle simply falls flat
and unbelievable
. mr
. b
anderas is uncharacteristically non
- charismatic as caesar
. weak
and ineffectual
, ther is little life in his screen performance
. the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of oney sort or another
. tom sizemore
( saving private ryan
)
, robert wagner
( austin powers ii
: tghe spy who shagged me
)
,
and richard masur
( fire down below
) are crooked promoters
, lucy liu
( payback
) is a sex
- starved hitchhiker looking for a ogod time
,
and lolita davidovich
( gods
and monsters
)
, is teh shared girlfriend who can
' t make her mind up which boxer she prefers
. because ofthe the weak characters anbd the lack of screen chemistry between them
, the film flounders wih all tjhe appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins
.
but even
then
, because the outcome is so predictably obvious
, the suspense factor is negated
and we are relagated to just watching two men pummel each other
. writer
/ director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed
, well
- choreographed
, well
- edited
,
and well
- performed
. if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film
. as it isnt
, thte scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak
and laughable
. the title isnt actually the most interesting aspect of the film
. the phrase
,
" play it to the bone
' is a reference to seeing something all thte way through or not quitting until you
' ve achieved your desired goal
. that is a biblical principle
.
" know ye not that they which run inthe a race run all
,
but one receiveth the prize
? so run
, thta ye may obtain
.
" 1 corinthians 9
: 24
[ kjv
] achieving anything worthy in life requires
" playing it to the bone
"
. we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets
and commitment levels in order to endure
and persevere past the obstancles
and distractions which lay between us
and our stated objectives
. this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the iin the developing maturity of our spiritual lives
. as a movie
, play it to the bone is hardly worth our time
.
but as a principle of life
, the phrase
" play it to the bone
" are words tothe live by
.
