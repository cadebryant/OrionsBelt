suicide is pointless
, everyone should know taht
. so wqat
' s this movie like
? you guessed it
.
.
. pointless
. the virgin suicides focuses on tje lives of the five lisbon sisters
, from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them
. when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide
, it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives ofthe many people forever
. that
' s what the press materials for thte film probably sday
. now here
' s what i say
: the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time
. boring
, arty
, pretentious junk thta is about as entertaining as
.
.
. well as committing suicide
. the movie lost me early on
, emmediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window
. the girl
' s father
( james woods
) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on
.
then
, as the scene ends
, thge lawn sprinklers come onthe
. is that a joke
? is thta supposed to be amusing inaddition some way
? from
then on
, the movie failed to draw me bakc inwhich
. performances are the only saving grace of the virgina suicides
. woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen
,
but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well
. dunst has the potential tothe be a big star
, if she chooses her projects well
.
and while this film is awful
, she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed
. there are also a few cameos in the film here
and there
, wich only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more
. as a result
, they all seem rather pointless
(
al
though there
' s a brief role given to michael pare from eddie
and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since
.
.
. well since eddie
and the cruisers
)
. perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from thge point of view of people who had very little access tothe teh main characters
. we never get any significant insight into the girls
and why they might be feeling what tehy
' re feeling
. all we really nkow is thgat mrs
. lisbon
( kathleen turner
) is strict
and keeps them on a short leash
. what mother doesn
' t
? it
' s certainly no reason to commit suicide
. with the godfather part iii
, sofia coppola proved that she hadnt no business being in front of the camera
. with the virgin suicides
, she proves she has no business behind it either
. having family connections doesn
' t entitle you tothe be allowed to make movies
. so attention film directors
.
.
. stop letting your daughters pout their way inot the industry
. just baceause tehy share your dna doesn
' t mean they share your talent
