sucide is pointless
, everyone should know that
. so what ' s this movie like
? you guessed it
.
.
. pointless
. the virgina suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters
, fomr the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them
. when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide
, it sets in motion a series of events that will chanage the lives of many people forever
. taht ' s what the press materials for the film propably say
. nowe here ' s waht i say
: the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time
. boring
, arty
, pretentious junk tyhat is about as entertaining as
.
.
. well as committing suicide
. the movie lost me early on
, immediately folowing the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window
. the girl ' s father
( james woods
) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on
.
then
, as the scene ends
, the lawn sprinklers come on
. is thast a joke
? is that supposed to be amusing in some way
? fomr
then on
, the movie failed to draw me back in
. performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides
. woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he cameback onscreen
,
but tyhe performance ofthe kirsten dunst as the next youngest daugter lux is worth mentioning as well
. dunst has thte potential to be a big star
, if she chooses her projects well
.
and while this film is awful
, she manages tothe come away ffrom it virtually unscathed
. there are also a few cameos in the film here
and there
, whlch only frustrate the audience as tehy leave you wanting more
. as a result
, they all seem rather pointless
(
although there ' s a brief role given to michael pare from eddie
and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since
.
.
. well since eddie
and the cruisers
)
. perhaps hte virgin suicides owudl hve worked had the story not been told from the point ofthe veiw of people who had very little access to the main characters
. we never get any significant insight into the girls
and why they might be feeling what they ' re feeling
. all we really know is that mrs
. lisbon
( kathleen turner
) is strict
and keeps them on a short leash
. what mother doesn ' t
? it ' s certainly no reason to commit suicide
. with the godfather part iii
, sofia coppola proved that she had no buisness being in front of tje camera
. with the virgin suicides
, she proves she has no busineses behind it either
. having family connections doesn ' t entitle you to be allowed to make movies
. so attention film directors
.
.
. stop letting your daughters pout their way into tghe industry
. just because they share your dna doesn ' t mean they share your talent
.
