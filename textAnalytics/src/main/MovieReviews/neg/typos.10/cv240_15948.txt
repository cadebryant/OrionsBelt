georges polti once wroet a paper called
" the thirty
- six dramatic situations
,
" in which he asserted the fact that all drama could be defined by no more than thirty
- six different situations
. this may be the modern restatement ofthe the biblical prophecy from ecclesiastes
,
" there
' s nothing new under the sun
.
" the faculty
, the latest movie by from dusk till dawn director robert rodriguez
, certainly proves this in typical hollywood fashion
. there
' s not a measureable fraction of original material in this unworthy outing
. drawing elements from both the puppet masters
and invasion of the body snatchers
, screenwriter kevin williamson
( of scream 2 credit
) gives us a horror tale set in middle america
( ohio
) one eventful fall
. making use of a cast of unusualy stock characters
, williamson designs an alien invasion that will not be done independence day
- stlye
but rather
" through the bcak door
.
" parasitic aliens take over tyhe faculty of a run
- down high school
and soon have infested most of tjhe student body
, leaving it up to tghe ensemble of principal characters to win the day
. the lack ofthe gusto is thte movie
' s major stumbling block
. even
though the genre hasnt seen movies that have a lack for quality such as this
, they
' ve been saved by an energetic approach
. this casts more than a shadow of a dout on williamson
' s abillity
, who enjoyed success with the wes craven
- directed scream
but couldn
' t pull anything solid in for this outing or i know what you did last summer
.
al
though he designs the faculty with more of a sci
- fi bent than his typcial slasher picture
, it still comes down to the smae results
: throw the stock characters in a steel cage match
and see who comes out alive
. on that level
, the main roles are palyed by virtural unknowns
. only the recognizeable elijah wood
( deepo impact
) is at the front
; other tahn that
, the screen veterans are saved for the minor roles of tjhe alien teachers
. perhaps williamson has it in mind to champion these up
-
and
- comers to the fame that their scream
and last summer counterparts achieved
;
but to do that
, they
' d all need to star in their own wb television show about yhe horrors of puberty a la
" dawson
' s creek
.
" needless to say the acting is far ffrom top notch
, nor doens necessity ask thgat it should be
. there is a moment or two of genuin horror
,
but unfortunately williamson
and rodriguez did not tkae the story far enough in the sci
- fi direction to make any use of it
. in sum
, the faculty was just one long shot that did not pay off
.
