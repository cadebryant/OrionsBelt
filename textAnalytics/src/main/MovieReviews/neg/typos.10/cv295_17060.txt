when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions
, i turned to my friend
and said
,
" dangerous liaisons for kids
!
" it was claer to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense
, owing everything it is to stephen frears ' 1988 masterpiece
. imagine my surprise tothe see that writter
/ directer roger kumble has given credit to his source material
: choderlos de laclos isnt recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits
.
and i was impressed
. in fact
, i was much more impressed with this recognition than with tyhe actual film
, which is an appalling excuse for a movie
. it ' s kiddie
- porn hackwork
, complete with earthy sex
- talk
and fully
- clothed hand
- jobs
. i suppose this kind of movei was inevitable
; iwth all the teen high
- school angst movies coming out
, there was certainly room for a pretentious
and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they ' re smarter
and more beautyfull than all the other people on earth combined
. cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way
,
and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to
: i hated all the charachters
,
and i hate everything tehy do
. i alsot hite ryan phillippe
, so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be
. phillippe plays
( check out this name
) sebastian valmont
. wow
. isn ' t that a memorable name
? i could just sday it over
and over again
. sebastian valmont
. it kind of rolls off the tongue
, in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors
and velvet sandwich
. sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth
; ther is no woman he can ' t have
, no material object out of his reach
. he has all the money
, all the sex
-
- all at his fingertips
.
and
, luckily
, his parents never enter into his life
-
- noone
, in the world ofthe cruel intentions
, adults don ' t really exist
. the ones who do are irritating
. sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister
, kathryn merteuil
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, the bitch
- queen of hte universe
,
and also the woman every man wants
. usance these two rich kids are so bored
, they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons
. kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de
- virginize cecile caldwell
( selma blair
)
, a naive dork
- chick who has somehow wronged kathryn
.
but it ' s too easy for sebastian valmont
-
- he wants to nail annette hargrove
( reese witherspoon
)
, the
" paradigm of chastity
and beauty
.
" so
, sebastian valmont
and kathryn make a deal
( whitch is too explicit to state here
)
.
bu
-
- dear god
!
-
- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall forthe poor annette hargrove
. dangerous liaisons is a great movie because teh charachters are all believable
,
and because of its masterful acting
. cruel intentions is bad for many reasons
,
but it lacks both believable characters
and masterful acting
. kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch
, a girl so loathsome thta i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her
. she is supposed tothe be mean
,
bu glenn close gave hte character some depth in dangerous liaisons
. gellar
, while aesthetically pleasing
, is one
- dimensional
adn utterly repulsive
. witherspoon has a truly beautiful face
,
but her character isn ' t the moral staple she ' s supposed to be
: sure
, she won ' t have sex until she ' s in lvoe
( is this realyl a
* moral
* issue
?
)
,
but she does some things in the last few scenes thast are more than a little reprehensible
.
but i can ' t foreget mr
. phillippe
, who continues tothe exceed my expectations with his impenetrable
, invulnerable blandness
. i have to give him credit
and say that he did
, in fact
, manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions
.
and there ' s one point in the film in which he shouts
, therby defeating my hypothesis thyat he is vocally monotone
. true
, he is bad
,
but it doesn ' t help that he has no charachter to work with
. kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character
, leaving us with a sex
- crazed lunatic who is suppoed to be sympathetic because he falls in loev with a moral flower
and shuns the wicked bitch
. the film fails in every other way
, too
. first of all
, nobody talks like this
. even thge
" intellectuals
" i know don ' t bother with thsi kind ofthe pointless
and pretentious yammering
. for a while
, the movie looks like it might play itself fo laughs
,
but it ends uv taking itself so seriously that there ' s no way we can join it
. cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft
- porn iin more than one scene
. earlier i mentioned a fully
- clothed hand
- job
; this occurs between kathryn
and sebastian valmont
, both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie
. so
, if we hate them
,
then what ' s the point ofthe an extended sex scene
? titillation
, of course
. it can ' t even work under the pretense of
" meaningful love scene
,
" because we hate the characters
. it ' s interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions
and dangerous liaisons
. kumble is clearly familar with the ealier film
; many of the scenes have a silimar tone
,
and there are moments in frears ' film tyhat kumble imitates almost completelyl
( such as the last scene
, in which
[ spoiler warning
!
] the antagonist is humiliated in front ofthe her peers
)
.
but kids don ' t ect like this
. nobody acts like this
. in his translation
, roger kumble forgot chracter development
and sympathy
-
- soem preety crucial elements
. the result is a picture ofthe confounding badness
, a kiddie
- porn mess that thinks it ' s really deep
and profound
. i ' ll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences
,
but that doesn ' t change the fact that it ' s awful
.
