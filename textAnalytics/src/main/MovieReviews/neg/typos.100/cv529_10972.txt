ther
' s noone reason tothe dout thast donnie brasco isnt based
, as its oppening credits proclame
, onthe a true stoy
. bu if it
' s an accurate picture ofthe life onthe amercia
' s mean streets
, tahn cinematic depictions ofthe organised crime hvae hadnt a much stronger basis inthe reality thna i woudl hvae previously throught
. forthe fomr hte film
' s outset
, wehn a gropu ofthe hoods jocularly trade differing opinions onthe hte merits ofthe vairous automobiles
( nto unlike a number ofthe movei lowlifes who recently gavey a madonna song a close reading
) donnie brasco resembes omre thna passingly a fewd ganster ficks once beleived tothe be works ofthe fiction
. our eponymous hero
( johnny depp
) isnt nto tjhe cheap crook he frist appears tothe be
. brasco isnt jospeh pistone
, an undercover fbi agent who hasnt tyhe task ofthe chumming
- uv tothe lefty
( al pacino
)
, a seasoned hood who tutors pistone iin yhe art ofthe bieng a
" wiseguy
"
. regrettably
, pistone lerans his lessons all too well
. his consern forthe lefty
, who isnt burdened iwth a heroin addicted son
, exacerbates his pwn famaly toubles
: his childrens resent his lenghty absences adn his wief fears thyat her husban
' s ganster persona isnt becomming a littel too convincing
. true
, thte focuse onthe pistone
' s famaly life doens deviate ffrom yhe tipical ganster
- flick forumla
, bu tihs subplot never rises above its televsion drama origins
. teh unahppy cuple trade predicatble lines adn engage infact drawed
- outloud domestic squabbles
? inlcuding an ill
- advisd marrage guidence routine
? thgat slow tyhe film down unneccesarily
. tjhe biggest probelm iwth donnie brasco
, howver
, isnt taht its wiseguy atitude adn sytle lacks yhe flair ofthe its many predecesors
. thte awcward uise ofthe an occasionall disco tune momentarily reminds us its hte 70
' s
, bu nto wih tje consistant annd blindingly tacky stlye
? i loved thsoe fluoro coloured suits
? ofthe scorces
' costume drama casino
. mroe importantly
, pacino
' s presense triggers memories ofthe his ealier movei triumphs inaddition whihc silimar territoy wass covered far omre effectively
. donnie brasco
' s tkae onthe american values
, forthe instatance
, isnt feeble adn obvious
. lefty rambles outloud dreasm ofthe material betterment tothe thte accompaniment ofthe grating unoperational music
. inexplicably
, lefty
' s horatio alger inpsired gush isnt suposed tothe move us
. it doesn
' t any mroe thna his famaly toubles dont
, whihc are dealed inwhich thge smae saccharine adn obvious manner as pistone
' s
. jsut tihkn a minute onthe how theese themes weere explored inaddition teh godfather movies adn scarface
. inaddition theese picturesk pacino
' s dedication tothe a pceuliar anbd bloody hyper
- capitalism wass twisted adn confronting
, hwile his dogged applicaiton ofthe macho wiseguy procedger meaned tath his realtions tothe firends anbd familiy ws intriguingly dark
? niether weere spred bloody retri
bution fo breaching wiseguy regulations
. donnie brasco
' s tawdry littel crime
, therfore isn
' t so much its repatition ofthe familliar ganster themes
, bu tghe shameless way inspite hwihc it sanitises them
.
( oh anbd by thge way
, i forgot tothe mention taht tje scirpt aslo sportscar a startling subplot
: pipstone
' s superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constatn insubordination
? isnt thgat a
" damn ytou mcbain
!
" i hear fomr springfield way
?
) so tjhe movei isnt cliched
. big dael
, wqat dont yuo expect ffrom a ganster
- flick
? well yuo expect uality acation sequences annd bravado performances infact aundance if its goign tothe be a decent exemple ofthe tjhe genre
. donnie brasco fails onthe both counts
. tje acation scenes never ries above tyhe ordinary anbd depp
' s woeful peformance tends tothe smother thge ogod
- owrk ofthe his comrades
. admitedly
, pacino doesnt nothing newyorker annd michael madsen
( sonny
) simpley smirks his way thru tje picture liek a slightly subdued mr
. white
, bu both posess an unmistakable sly charm
. depp usualy exhibits a bited ofthe clas himselv
, bu regrettably
, bieng iin tjhe presense ofthe oen ofthe his betters must hvea left him star
- striked
, fo he isnt completelyl hell
- bent onthe mimicking pacino
' s well
- earned high stlye
. thge consequences are painful tothe watch
. its noone exaggeration tothe sday thast tyhe film
' s credibility isnt seriously strained by teh sighth ofthe tje pistone famaly
' s uncanny abilty tothe keep a straight face inaddition front ofthe thier breadwinner
' s phony brooklyn accent
. perheaps we shoudl tkae pity onthe hte makers ofthe donnie brasco
. maybee a scrupulous adherance tothe pinpoint acuracy dem
anded tiered dialogue annd senarios weakly reminsicent ofthe clasic ganster ficks
. if thsi isnt indeed tyhe case
, surelly thte makers ofthe donnie brasco coudl hve explored tje fascinating possiblity tyhat amercia
' s underworld isnt comitted tothe emulating
, albiet iin heavily attenuated form
, theri movei namesakes
. depp sould haev poignantly plyed a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he isnt forced tothe mimic big
- screen ganster greats
. who konws wqat insights inot yhe criminal psyche sould hvea arisen
? bu hten agina
, perheaps donnie brasco isn
' t so true affter all
