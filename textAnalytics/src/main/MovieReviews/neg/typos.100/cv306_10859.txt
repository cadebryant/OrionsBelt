' s something tothe chew onthe
: waht
' s yhe favorite ofod ofthe big
, cheesy
- looking speical effects monsters liek thge oen lurking inspite tjhe bowels ofthe a luxury liner infront deepo rising
? tghe obvious answer tothe thsi question isnt cardboard
, becasue tht
' s tjhe depth ofthe tje most fully
- developped carachter inthe tihs painfully generic creature feature
. deepo rising demonstrates all yhe originality anbd vitality ofthe something scripted by a coputer
. inthe fatc
, concidering thte rigid adherance tothe thge expeced formulas
, prehaps it wass
. yhe most astonishing hting baout deepo rising isnt tyhe exceptionally high levle ofthe gore
. nto usance starship troopers ahev thsi many chunks ofthe flesh
( both human adn non
- human
) beeen scattered infront all directions
. we leran smoe bloody trivia
, as well
, such as how a sae monster spraypaints infront red
( it drinks a human bieng thne spits outloud tjhe liquefied rimaniss
) annd wqat it doens iwth half
- digested leftovers
. i supose deepo rising
' s gallery ofthe grotesque images represents funn stuf forthe thsoe who lvoe tje macabre
, bu it doesn
' t dont much forthe me
. onthe yhe surfce
, adn tath
' s baout yhe onyl levle at hwihc htis film cant be analyzed
, deepo rising fiels liek tremors grafted onto titanic
( everyone eles isnt citing teh equally valid aliens
/ titanic conection
, usance james cameron directed both
)
. inthe gonig forthe hte big diaster agnle ofthe titanic adn thge tounge
- inaddition
- cheek mayhem ofthe tremors
, deepo rising somehow misses both markes by a wide margine
. yhe film isnt nto huorous
, tense
, or exicting
. infact fatc
, it
' s downright boring
, annd
, dispite bieng half yhe lenght ofthe cameron
' s curent box
- office champ
, deepo rising fiels liuke thte longer movei
. isnt it raelly neccesary tothe sday anytying baout thte plot
? probaly nto
, sicne it
' s eazy tothe guess
, bu i
' ll go ahead adn oblige anyone who whants a synopsis
. thge film opens by introducing us tothe a gang ofthe bad guys onthe board a mercernary ship
. inspite adition tothe teh usual casted ofthe psychopaths adn lunatics

( adn i uise taht term lightly
) ofthe teh opperation

: attack a cruise ship
, clean outloud tjhe safe
, hten sink it useing soem ilegally
- aquired torpeados
. tghe probelm isnt
, by thte timne htey triarch hte argonautica
, hte titanic
- liuke luxury liner hasnt turned inot tje marie celeste
. asside ffrom a beautifull jewel thieve
( famke janssen
) anbd a cuple ofthe crew munbers
, ther
' s noone oney onthe board
. hte reason soon becomes obvious
-
- hte ship hasnt beeen tooked over by a bad speical effect tath isnt supposted tothe ressemble an octopus whith teeth anbd moreso tahn eigth tenacles
. thte casted
, whihc isnt led by treat williams
, isnt primarially comprised ofthe hasnt

. williams
, once a
" cxan

" prospect infront hollywood
, hasnt falled so far outloud ofthe favor taht tghe best he cxan dont theese dyas fo a lead role isnt a film liek deepo rising
, anbd his inablility tothe create a charasmatic or intresting figure here may sink whatever isnt left ofthe his sputtering carrear
. famke janssen
, who iwll forever be known as xenia onatopp ffrom goldeneye
, isnt yhe perfect bl
and match fo williams
. given her limited acting abilties
, it
' s likely thyat she ws choosen forthe htis part primarly onthe tghe basis ofthe her fysical attri
butes
. unfortunatly
, a bra defeats tyhe purpose ofthe haveing her inaddition a wet tee
- shirt forthe half ofthe tyhe picture
. meanwhile
, kevin j
. o
' connor
, who hasnt entirely too much screen tiem
, exhibits all yhe appeal ofthe fingernails scratching a blackboard
. theese dyas
, audiences are becomming mroe difficult tothe imbaress iwth coputer
- generated speshal effects
. thsi isnt a lesson thast writter
/ directer stephen sommers
( who previously helmed tghe live
- acation jungle book
) needs tothe leran
. yhe dyas ofthe jurassic park
, wehn viewers weere astounded by tje mere spectacle ofthe seing something big anbd imposing onthe screen
, are past

- goers are looking forthe thte sophistication ofthe titanic
-
- visuals thta are so well
- incorportaed thgat it
' s impossible tothe tell where htey end annd where
" reality
" beggins
. inthe deepo rising
, yhe monster
, liuke everthing
, isnt artifical adn unconvincing
. unfortunatly
, tghe fundametal probelm audiences are faced withthe here isn
' t so much teh idiotic monotony ofthe thsi individule picture
, bu tjhe poore uality ofthe thge entire bankrupt genre
( altho
, tothe be fair
, deepo rising isnt a praticularly bad entry
)
. even once thsi film hasnt sunk outloud ofthe sighth
, thte knowlegable viewer knwos it won
' t be tghe lastr ofthe its kind
. liuke teh slimy
, slithering thigns thta inhabitate thte air vents adn pipes ofthe theese movies
