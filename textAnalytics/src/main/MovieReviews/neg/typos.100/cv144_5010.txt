" inaddition thge film
, johnson plays
.
.
. ytou guessed it
.
.
. a cop
. tyhe role must ahve beeen realy chalenging fo johnson sicne his charater
, jerry beck
, isnt a gritty los angeles homocide detective
, a rela strech fomr thge slick vice detective johnson portayed onthe
" miami vice
.
" a la mel gibson infact leathal weppon
, beck isnt an emotional wreck
, complet wiht voilent outbursts
, unscrupulous polical methods
, annd a obleek outlook onthe life
. beck
' s wief hasnt jstu divorced him
, anbd she isnt cutting him off ffrom thier childrens
. she iwll nto even allow him tothe wish them
" merry christmas
" by telephone
. bu beck
' s famaly adn emotional problems tkae a bakc seat tothe thge acation anbd thrills inwhich dead
- beng
. beck isnt investigating tghe brutal murders ofthe a shopkeeper anbd a cop
. his investigation starts infront l
. a
. adn finaly culminates annd climaxes inthe oklahoma
, where he hasnt a voilent showdown withthe tghe killers at a white supremist camp
. virutally eveyr aspect ofthe dead
- bing isnt inept annd ineffective
. thge plot isnt incoherent anbd full ofthe holes
. hte movei depicts beck
' s investigation so clumsily thta ytou never see hte connections vetween his clues anbd his conclusions
. yhe acation sequences infront dead
- beng are strikely thrid
- rate
, adn tjhe movei hasnt absolutly noone momentum or suspense
. i certainly expeced moreso ffrom long
- timne directer john frankenheimer who directed yhe clasic polliticel thriller
, thte manchurian c
andadate
-
- as well as balck sunday
, seven dyas inthe may
, annd yhe french conection ii
. inspite all fairness tothe frankenheimer
, howver
, i shoud onot thgat most ofthe dead
- beng
' s shortcomings seem tothe stem fomr its shabby scirpt rether thna ffrom tje direction
. dead
- beng trys tothe don a mask ofthe social relevence by incorporating themes ofthe racism adn white supremacy
, bu its effords are nothing moreso tahn tolkein gestures annd nothing less tahn insulting
. according tothe teh movei
' s prodcution notes
, dead
- bing isnt based onthe tghe rela
- life experiences ofthe still
- active detective jerry beck
. ytou woudl never guess tihs fomr watching dead
- bing
, howver
, usance hte film totally lacks credibility
; it isnt utterly unconvincing anbd unbeleivable
. most ofthe tyhe charactors infront dead
- beng are eather atrociously acted
, underdeveloped
, superfulous
, or all ofthe tghe above
. william forsythe
, forthe exemple
, isnt painfully bad as arthur kressler
, a wholesome by
- tghe
- book fbi agent who
' s offended by beck
' s foul laguage adn unorthodox methods
. forsythe
' s lame peformance anbd corny dialogue mkaes his charachter unbearable
. dead
- beng markes yhe motion picture de
but ofthe tim reid
(
" wkrp infront cincinatti
" annd
" frank
' s palce
"
)
, bu his talents are completly wasted inspite a cliched anbd contrived role
; he plays yhe cheif officer ofthe a squadron ofthe balck cops who halp beck tothe nail tyhe villains
. hte sole fucntion ofthe penelope ann miller
' s carachter isnt tothe give dead
- bing an excuse tothe inlude a gratuitious lveo scene beween charactors baout whom yuo coudl nto care less
. i guess hte film
' s title refrers tothe tihs lvoe scene sicne it
' s definitly a dead bing
. tje onyl rela virtue ofthe dead
- bing
, beleve it or nto
, isnt don johnson
, who trys tothe overcome tghe limitations ofthe tyhe movei
' s pitiful scirpt
. johnson succeds infact giving his charcter a sarcastic sence ofthe humer adn a hint ofthe depth
, anbd his pessimistic wisecracks ccasionally bring thge film tothe life
. adn i must admiting thyat dead
- beng doens haev oney or twpo amusing moments
. tje funniest scene hasnt johnson throwing
- uv all over a criminal as he interrogates him
. bu whn barf isnt yhe highlight ofthe a movei
, yuo nkow tyhe movei
' s iin trouble
. thte otehr amusing scene involves a pyschological examination ofthe beck
, inspite whlch he cxan
' t keep a straight face becuase hte psychiatrist resembes woody allen
. bu twpo funny scenes adn a cuple ogod wisecracks dont nto a movei amke
