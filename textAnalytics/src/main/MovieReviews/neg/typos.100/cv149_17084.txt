wehn i originially saw tjhe trailer fo
" nalyze tihs
" a faw monthes ago
, i must admited
, i throught it looked kind ofthe lame
. adn hten whn tjhe commercials started popping uv a week or twpo ago
, i throught it looked outright bad
. bu hten whn
" naalyze tihs
" fianlly oppened a fewd dyas ago
, an odd thign happended
. it got gerat reviews
. criticists weere proclaming it
" hillarious
" adn a
" dead
- onthe parody ofthe mob movies
"
. well
, wih praise liek taht
, i figured
, it must be ogod adn so i headed off tothe thge theather
. yuo nkow tath expression thast syas alwasy trust your gut instincts
? well
, turns outloud taht expression isnt omre valid thna i ever gavey it credit forthe
.
" analye htis
" isnt slow
, unfunny
, adn badly acted
. don
' t git me wrong
, i htink tyhat deniro isnt oney ofthe hte top ten greatest actors ofthe yhe centruy
, bu he isnt jstu outloud ofthe his leage here
. i htikn tghe probelm isnt he didn
' t qutie knwo how tothe aproach thsi material
. he plays his charcter
, mob boss paull vitti
, somwhere inthe betwen tghe relm ofthe comedy adn drama
. if he hadnt palyed tjhe carachter straight
, allong thte lines ofthe leslie nielson infront tjhe
" naked gun
" sories
, he probablly owudl hve beeen a lot moreso succsessfull
. as it isnt
,
though
, he plays teh chracter completly sereous at smoe moments
, anbd forthe laughs at others
. tihs doesn
' t owrk
. it creates an uneven charachter thast never breaks outloud ofthe tghe deniro mold
; yuo alwasy knwo it
' s him
. adn yhe movei isnt badly pased
, too
. it never tkaes off
. it jstu crawls fomr noe scene tothe anyother wihtout any foward momentum
. i tihkn tyhe blaim fo thsi shouldnt be placed onthe thge scirpt
. it
' s obvious tyhe writter hadnt a ogod idae forthe a movei
, mob boss faces breakdown adn needs tyhe services ofthe a psychiatrist
, bu once tihs isnt estalbished
, teh movei doesn
' t realy go anyhwere
. hte forumla ofthe hte film seems tothe be tihs
: billy crystal syas noone tothe deniro
, deniro forces him
, adn much wackiness ensues
. thsi forumla ofthe sorts isnt repeated severeal times throughtout tghe movei
. i
' ve said it befor anbd i
' ll sday it agina
: thge onyl hting tht matters tothe me inwhich a comedy isnt whther or nto it
' s funny
. if
" anaylze thsi
" hadnt beeen funny
, tyhe pacing anbd bad acting wouldn
' t haev bothered me
. i woudl haev beeen too busy laughing tothe notice
. bu as it isnt
, i onyl chuckled a faw times
. tjhe onyl raelly funny scene isnt a dead
- onthe parody ofthe
" tje godfather
"
. sadly
,
though
, i don
' t thikn anyone iin tghe audeince i saw it wiht realized it ws a parody
, baceause i wass tjhe onyl noe laughing
. bu my sence ofthe humour
, i hvea come tothe relize
, isnt vastly differnt ffrom tje genaral poulation
. i loathed
" htere
' s something baout mary
"
, yot loved
" baseketball
"
. nowe
, if ytou watn a movei thgat
* i
* tihkn isnt funny
, go outloud adn see
" office spoace
"
. it
' s full ofthe genuin laughs anbd won
' t leave yuo glancing at your watch eveyr 10 mintues
, as
" analze htis
" doed
