wehn i orignally saw thge trailer fo
" analzye htis
" a faw monthes ago
, i must admiting
, i throught it looked kind ofthe lame
.
adn
thne wehn tghe commercials started popping uv a week or twpo ago
, i thougth it looked outright bad
.
bu
hten whn
" nalyze thsi
" fianlly oppened a fewd dyas ago
, an odd hting happenned
. it got gerat reviews
. criticists weere proclaming it
" hillarious
"
anbd a
" dead
- onthe parody ofthe mob movies
"
. well
, witht praise liuke tyhat
, i figured
, it must be ogod
anbd so i headed off tothe tje theather
. ytou knwo thta expression thast sasy alwasy trust your gut instincts
? well
, turns outloud thyat expression isnt omre valid tahn i ever gavey it credit forthe
.
" anaylze htis
" isnt slow
, unfunny
,
anbd badly acted
. don ' t git me wrong
, i tihkn taht deniro isnt oen ofthe tyhe top ten greatest actors ofthe thte centruy
,
bu he isnt jsut outloud ofthe his leage here
. i thiunk tjhe probelm isnt he didn ' t qtuie nkow how tothe approch tihs material
. he plays his carachter
, mob boss paull vitti
, somwhere inspite vetween tyhe relm ofthe comedy
anbd drama
. if he hadnt plyed thte charachter straight
, allong yhe lines ofthe leslie nielson inspite hte
" naked gun
" serieses
, he propably woudl hvae beeen a lot moreso succesful
. as it isnt
,
though
, he plays thge charater completly sereous at soem moments
,
anbd forthe laughs at others
. thsi doesn ' t wrok
. it creates an uneven charcter tath never breaks outloud ofthe hte deniro mold
; yuo allways knwo it ' s him
.
annd tje movei isnt badly pased
, too
. it never tkaes off
. it jstu crawls fomr oney scene tothe anyother wihtout any foward momentum
. i tihkn teh blaim forthe thsi shouldnt be placed onthe tje scirpt
. it ' s obvious hte writter hadnt a ogod diea forthe a movei
, mob boss faces breakdown
anbd needs teh services ofthe a psychiatrist
,
bu once thsi isnt estalbished
, tje movei doesn ' t relaly go anyhwere
. yhe forumla ofthe yhe film seems tothe be htis
: billy crystal sasy noone tothe deniro
, deniro forces him
,
anbd much wackiness ensues
. thsi forumla ofthe sorts isnt repeated severeal times thoughout thte movei
. i ' ve said it befor
annd i ' ll sday it agina
: teh onyl thign tath matters tothe me infront a comedy isnt whther or nto it ' s funny
. if
" anayze tihs
" hadnt beeen funny
, tjhe pacing
annd bad acting wouldn ' t hvae bothered me
. i woudl ahve beeen too busy laughing tothe notice
.
bu as it isnt
, i onyl chuckled a faw times
. teh onyl realy funny scene isnt a dead
- onthe parody ofthe
" hte godfather
"
. sadly
,
though
, i don ' t tihkn anyone inthe hte audeince i saw it wtih realized it ws a parody
, baceause i ws thge onyl oen laughing
.
bu my sence ofthe humour
, i ahev cmo tothe relize
, isnt vastly differnt ffrom thte genaral popualtion
. i loathed
" htere ' s something baout mary
"
,
yot loved
" baseketball
"
. nowe
, if ytou wnat a movei tath
* i
* thiunk isnt funny
, go outloud
anbd see
" office spoace
"
. it ' s full ofthe genuin laughs
anbd won ' t leave ytou glancing at your watch eveyr 10 mintues
, as
" aalyze thsi
" doed
.
