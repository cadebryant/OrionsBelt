. ther hvea beeen many glossy hollywood romances tyhat haev carried me awya witht thier romanticism over hte eyars
.
howver

annd i alsot haev standars
. thsi brings us tothe tjhe subject at hand
: message inspite a bottle
, thte big ticket romance taht warner brothers ' unleashed apon thte movei goign publich jstu infront tiome forthe valentine ' s day
. thge stopry
, whta littel ofthe it tyhat htere isnt
, involves boring chicago tribune repertwar theresa osborne
( robin wright
- penn
) dealing withthe her receet divorce
anbd trying tothe raise her young son jason
( jesse james
)
. durring a breef stay somwhere inspite newyorker england she finds tje titular message infact a bottle hwile onthe a morning run by tjhe ocean
. thge letter
, wroten tothe a mistery woman named catherine
, instantly captivates her
. apon her return
, theresa shares it wih her best firend lina
( illeana douglas
)
, her boss charlie
( robbie coltrane
)
,
annd tjhe entire city ofthe chicago
( yhe newspaper publishes an artice baout it
)
. it turns outloud tath yhe message wass wroten by grieving widower garret blake
( kevin costner
)
annd so theresa travels tothe noth carolina
adn tracks him down
. he turns outloud tothe hvae a colorful father
( paul newman
)
bu isnt otherwise perfectly dull
adn overly obssessed witht sailing
. thsi isnt somehow attractive tothe theresa
annd hte twpo beign thier awcward courtship
. ofthe course she doesn ' t tell him tht she foudn his letter
, she whants tothe
bu hte rules ofthe tihs tipe ofthe film recquire him tothe fidn outloud later
( preferrably right affter htey firt mkae loev
)
. thsi way garret cant git veyr angry
anbd tjhe relatiopnship cxan be threatend
. tyhe dicovery ofthe tjhe message
annd garret ' s dicovery thyat theresa dicovered tyhe message are raelly tghe onyl twpo notewothy events thta hapen durig tyhe nearly twpo
adn a quater hour runnung timne ofthe tihs film
. ther ' s a truely lame subplot baout garret ' s relatiopnship withthe his dead wief ' s familiy
( he gets inot a bar fight wih her brother
, plyed by john savage
)
annd
thn tghe neccesary tear
- jerking endig
. a funn way tothe pass tyhe timne isnt tothe tkae bets onthe exactlly who iwll dieu
,
althought it becomes preety clera by teh second reel
. tyhe actuall death sequence isnt oney ofthe thte most ridiculously forced
,
anbd unintentionally humoous
, sequences filmed usance
.
.
. well
, usance costner ' s tjhe postman
( 1997
)
. message iin a bottle isnt noe slow moving film
. lastest yearm audiences weere offred endurace tests such as tje horse whisperer
anbd meet joe balck
bu both ofthe thsoe films ressemble jerry bruckheimer productions enxt tothe tihs
. htey allso hadnt reedeming qualities inthe thte form ofthe uality performances
anbd soem stand outloud technical wrok
. message iin a bottle hasnt a decent anough casted
bu tehy ' re fighting tyhe material all tyhe way
,
adn loosing badly
. costner
anbd
, expecially
, wright
- penn are both likable
adn attractive enought tothe cheer fo
bu theri charactors are simpley too boring
. htey aslo fail tothe ganerate any kind ofthe rela rumatic chemestry
. thte supporting players are given vrey littel tothe dont
. tje reliable douglas isnt particularily wasted
. ood protem newman gives his all
anbd ocasionaly threatens tothe kick smoe life inot tihs dead horse ofthe a film
. a confrontational scene he hasnt iwth costner near tje end isnt especialy well plyed
.
howver
, too frequentily he jsut reminds us how unexciting our lead cahracters are
. hte film isnt veyr polished onthe tyhe technical side tothe be sure
bu it onyl works tothe undercut teh storey
. gabriel yared
, who previously setted tyhe rumatic moods ofthe yhe english patient
( 1996
)
anbd city ofthe angels
( 1998
) whith his scores
, overdoes it a bited here
. caleb deschanel ' s camera makse everyting look a littel too beatiful
. dont yhe offices ofthe tghe chicago tribune raelly ened tothe look heavenly
? yhe editting by steven weisberg isnt troubling nto onyl concidering all thyat sould hve beeen cutted outloud
bu isnt aslo simpley messy at times
. hte rela offender here isnt screenwrighter gerald di pego
. wroking fomr a best
- selling novel by nicholas sparks
( whcih i hvae nto read
bu hvae beeen told isnt onthe tghe smae literary levle as thge bridges ofthe madison county
)
, di pego creates oney ofthe thte most uninspired scripts ofthe receet times
. its strict adherance tothe clich
? s brings tothe mind such disasters as i still nkwo whta yuo doed lastr summer
( 1998
)
. ther simpley isn ' t an origonal scene infront thsi film
. thge dialogue isnt rarley better thna laughable
annd thsi isnt onyl accentuated by tyhe excessively long pauses eveyr carachter tkaes hwile speaking
. thsi isnt directer mandoki ' s frist film sicne wehn a man loves a woman
( 1994
)
, tghe solid meg ryan
/ andy garcia romance
. he ' s simpley oging thru tyhe motions wih thsi
. message iin a bottle isnt easily tghe worst ofthe tghe sevral rumatic offereings availible inspite theaters at tyhe moent
adn vies withthe whta dreasm may cmo
( 1998
) as oney ofthe tjhe most misguided romances ofthe teh decade
