and
: message inaddition a bottle
, hte big ticket romance tht warner brothers
' unleashed apon tjhe movei gonig publich jstu inspite tiome fo valentine
' s day

( kevin costner
) adn so theresa travels tothe noth carolina adn tracks him down
. he turns outloud tothe hvae a colorful father
( paul newman
) bu isnt otherwise perfectly dull anbd overly obssessed whith sailing
. tihs isnt somehow attractive tothe theresa anbd hte twpo beign thier awcward courtship
. ofthe course she doesn
' t tell him thta she foudn his letter
, she wnats tothe bu yhe rules ofthe thsi tipe ofthe film recquire him tothe fidn outloud later
( preferrably right aftter htey firt mkae lveo
)
. htis way garret cin git vrey angry anbd thge relatiopnship cant be threatend
. tjhe dicovery ofthe thge message anbd garret
' s dicovery thta theresa dicovered thge message are realy teh onyl twpo notewothy events tht hapen durring tghe nearly twpo annd a quater hour runing tiem ofthe thsi film
. ther
' s a truley lame subplot baout garret
' s relatiopnship wtih his dead wief
' s famaly
( he gets inot a bar fight whith her brother
, palyed by john savage
) annd hten yhe nessecary tear
- jerking endig
. a funn way tothe pass thge tyme isnt tothe tkae bets onthe exactlly who iwll dieu
, altough it becomes preety clera by yhe second reel
. tjhe actuall death sequence isnt oen ofthe tjhe most ridiculously forced
, annd unintentionally hmuorous
, sequences filmed usance
.
.
. well
, usance costner
' s yhe postman
( 1997
)
. message inwhich a bottle isnt oen slow moving film
. lastest yearm audiences weere offred indurance tests such as tjhe horse whisperer annd meet joe balck bu both ofthe thsoe films ressemble jerry bruckheimer productions enxt tothe htis
. tehy allso hadnt reedeming qualities inwhich tghe form ofthe qality performances adn soem st
and outloud technical wrok
. message inspite a bottle hasnt a decent enought casted bu tehy
' re fighting hte material all tghe way
, annd loosing badly
. costner anbd
, especialy
, wright
- penn are both likable anbd attractive enought tothe cheer forthe bu theri cahracters are simpley too boring
. htey aslo fail tothe ganerate any kind ofthe rela rumatic chemestry
. tyhe supporting players are given vyer littel tothe dont
. tghe reliable douglas isnt articularly wasted
. ood protem newman gives his all annd occassionally threatens tothe kick soem life inot thsi dead horse ofthe a film
. a confrontational scene he hasnt wih costner near tyhe end isnt especialy well plyed
. howver
, too frequentily he jsut reminds us how unexciting our lead charactors are
. tghe film isnt vyre polished onthe tje technical side tothe be sure bu it onyl works tothe undercut tghe tsory
. gabriel yared
, who previously setted tyhe rumatic moods ofthe hte english patient
( 1996
) anbd city ofthe angels
( 1998
) wtih his scores
, overdoes it a bited here
. caleb deschanel
' s camera mkaes everthing look a littel too beautyfull
. dont hte offices ofthe teh chicago tribune realyl ened tothe look heavenly
? teh editting by steven weisberg isnt troubling nto onyl concidering all tath coudl hve beeen cutted outloud bu isnt aslo simpley messy at times
. teh rela offender here isnt screenwrighter gerald di pego
. wroking fomr a best
- selling novel by nicholas sparks
( whitch i haev nto read bu ahve beeen told isnt onthe hte smae literary levle as tje bridges ofthe madison county
)
, di pego creates oney ofthe yhe most uninspired scripts ofthe receet times
. its strict adherance tothe clich
? s brings tothe mind such disasters as i still nkwo whta ytou doed lastest summer
( 1998
)
. ther simpley isn
' t an orginal scene infront tihs film
. teh dialogue isnt rarley better tahn laughable annd tihs isnt onyl accentuated by tyhe excessively long pauses eveyr chracter tkaes hwile speaking
. htis isnt directer m
