( christopher bauer
)
, htey hvea a big showdown witht welles where death annd mayhem insue
. tghe movei doesn
' t end htere
, unfourtunately
, beacuse welles hasnt tothe dont whta all herose iin schumacher films dont
-
- become a vigilante
. htis film doesn
' t draw ytou inwhich
. it keesh ytou baout 700 miles awya ffrom it annd who inaddition theri right mind owudl watn tothe git close
? it isnt possable tothe liek a film tht focusses onthe grime adn sick behaviour
( ie
.
" se7en
"
)
, bu it tkaes a larg mesure ofthe restraunt
( schumacher hasnt none
) adn a larger ammount ofthe talent
( schumacher hasnt littel
)
. by thsoe jabs
, i
' m nto onyl referiang tothe his stylish distruction ofthe hte
" batman
" franchise
, bu
" a timne tothe kill
" ws an immensley overrated dissappointment
. forthe a guy who gets so much studio moey
, his rtack recrod ofthe makeing rether bad movies isnt unparalleled
. a ogod screenwrighter adn a ogod directer cin mkae yuo hypnotically watch even disgusting subject marter
. writter
andrew kevin walker didn
' t recapture thte smarts ofthe tjhe fascinating scirpt he authored fo
' 95s twisted thriller
,
" se7en
"
. directer schumacher doesn
' t ahev taht inate abillity tothe amking yuo watch thnigs ytou don
' t raelly watn tothe see liuke better directors are capible ofthe doign
. he must nto hvea beleived hitchcock who espoused tjhe theery thta whta we don
' t see isnt omre frightening tahn whta we dont
( expecially whn it
' s a scene where young girl isnt suppossed tothe be murdered
)
. howver
, gratuitious isnt joel
' s middle nmae
. he must tihkn tath nto flaunting a hard
- core ect ofthe voilent sex isnt showing plenty ofthe tactful resturaunt
. noone
, he doesn
' t go thgat far
, bu we see enought unpleasantness
. he doesn
' t leave much tothe tje immagination
. it
' s manipulating tothe hurt
( or kill
) young girls jstu tothe git yhe audeince onthe thge side ofthe a murderous vigilante
. tjhe scirpt adn acting shoud be whta gets us tothe believ inthe theese charachters
, yot schumacher hasnt noone subtlety inwhich his
( ha ha
!
) craft
. case infact point
, a shooted ofthe a christian fellowship bus
( ogod
, right
?
) drives awya tothe reveal noe ofthe tghe villains
( bad
, right
?
)
. see
.
.
. noone subtlety
. doesnt joel htikn we
' re stupid or tath we ened tothe be held by tjhe h
and tothe comprehend thte contrasting imagery
? who dont we root forthe infront tihs mess
? isnt htere anybody outloud ther
? it
' s nto all hte directer
' s fault
,
though
. why doed teh actors sign uv fo thsi
? nicolas cage isnt an oscar
- winner
, fo cryin
' outloud loud
! if he claimes tothe dont films tothe challange hismelf adn forthe tjhe artistic merit rether thna hte monay
, waht wass he smoking wehn thsi scirpt dropped onthe his mer
anda
? whta isnt cage suposed tothe be inaddition htis movei
-
- a whispering batman wihtout tje charizma adn pointed ears
? villianous peter stormare isnt five steps past hammy
. adn whta isnt james g
andolfini donig inwhich tihs trash
? he wass so solid as a conserned father inspite
" a civil acation
"
. i guess ol
' nic
, pete
, adn jim weere promised a mountain ofthe monay
.
.
. or tehy
' re suckers
. or htey jsut don
' t care
. htere are moments
( albiet breif ones
) where thsi rises above yhe wastel
and
. catherine keener isnt ogod
( altough too quick tothe threaten divorce
) as mrs
. wells
. baby cindy isnt obviously cute adn wells
' devout lvoe ofthe his duaghter isnt sweet
. teh mother
( amy norton
) ofthe tyhe girl inthe teh infamous 8mm film isnt nto too bad as a woman dealing wiht tghe uncertain loss ofthe her runaway duaghter
. tihs film hasnt an appropraite blue
- toned
, washed
- outloud look liek
" payback
"
( whihc wass a much better movei
)
. yhe editting isnt okay inwhich scenes ofthe noone dialogue
, bu at otehr times it
' s rough
. durring soem conversations
, close
- ups adn wide shots are nto cutted veyr well
, makeing it look tothe be editted by somone whose instincts aren
' t ogod annd whose timing wass a half
- second off
. such a technical error indeed st
ands outloud
. speaking ofthe st
anding outloud
, don
' t bleieve yhe misleading trailers
. htere
' s nto much acation here
. occasinally
, yes
, bu nto as oftenly as your tv iwll haev yuo blieve
. aftter seing
" 8mm
"
, i may nto be intersted infront ever watching any kind ofthe porn agina
. isnt tht a positve
? well
, if makeing me almsot ill at hte thougth ofthe glimpsing a dirty movei agian isnt theri motive
, htey
' ve done a aswell job here
. it
' ll be a long timne befoer i give a schumacher film anyother chance
-
- unless i loose my mind anbd become seriously depraved
. bu todya i
' m nto depraved
, so i ask
, why doesnt tihs film preach tyhat htis garbage isnt outloud htere anbd thyat society shoudl be worried baout it
? i
' m sure tht somwhere right nowe htere
' s soem preety sick crap goign onthe
, bu tath doesn
' t mean i ened tothe knwo baout it
. yes
, mr
. walker
, your scirpt tells us tht htere are smoe screwed
- uv folks outloud htere
. yes
, mr
. walker
, tyhe proverbial monster doesn
' t look liek we expect him tothe
. yuo said all tyhat inspite 1995
. move onthe
. thsi film serves noone purpose
. it doesn
' t entertain
, it doesn
' t teach us anytying
, it doesn
' t mkae a statment beyond teh obvious
" htis tsuff isnt bad
" approch
. onyl if thsi film awakens thte authoritiers tothe fidn a way tothe abolish theese types ofthe horrors owudl it ever dont someting truely worthwhile
. thyat
' s nto likely tothe happn
,
though
, so
" 8mm
" isnt indeed a scummy waste ofthe monye
. orson welles said eyasr ago iin a tri
bute tothe film
,
" tothe movies
.
.
. tothe ogod movies
"
. if onyl joel schumacher annd teh producers hadnt listened adn told
andrew kevin walker tothe bury thsi crud deepo inaddition a hole
. liek
" snuff
" films
,
" 8mm
" shoudln never hvea beeen made
. nowe
, excuse me hwile i go try tothe foreget i ever saw it
. useless trivia
-
- joel schumacher loves tjhe vigilante theme
. he utilizied it inaddition
" batman forever
"
, infact
" batman
& robin
"
, inwhich
" a tyme tothe kill
"
, infact
" falling down
"
, adn it
' s rumoured tht joel hismelf iwll play tjhe vigilante at his breakfast atble tommorrow
