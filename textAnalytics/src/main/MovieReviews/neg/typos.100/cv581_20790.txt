once apon a tiome jean
- claude van damme wass a decent acation hero
. hte muscles ffrom brussels bursted inot tghe hollywood market wtih mindless adventure films
, boasting his spectauclar martial
- arts ablity
. smoe ofthe theese excursions weere funn
. bu nowe it seems liuke watching a van damme movei hasnt become a painful chore
, whith noone rewards bu tghe virutally garanteed helping ofthe mind
- numbing acation
. adn wehn yhe acation goes sour
, wqat isnt ther left tothe enjoy
? i
' ll explane
. knock off isnt baout a pair ofthe counterfit jeans salesmen wroking outloud ofthe an office infact hong kong
. marcus ravy
( van damme
)
, a babe
- magent adn stylish dresser
, heads uv tghe comany wih an annoying weasel ofthe a partner
( rob schneider
)
. htey become part ofthe a plot involving microbombs implanted iin counterfit jeans
, seamingly by a mole inaddition tyhe bussiness
. i
' m gogin tothe reveal baout everyting inwhich teh enxt paragraph
, so if ytou wanna a review devoid ofthe spoilers
, skip onto thge enxt oney
. i
' m nto qtuie sure who gives a crap
, bu i
' ll issue a warning anyhow
. tommy isnt realyl wroking iwth tjhe cia
. his boss
( a vyre hammy annd flat paul sorvino
) isnt yhe mole
, anbd he whants tothe cause carnage wtih theese tiny bu immensley powerfull super weapons
. he even stoops so low tothe put them inot childrens
' s toys
. if ytou thougth tihs plot outline sounded intriguing
, thn yuo probablly wiull enjoy knock off
. if yuo thiunk thast tihs rediculous setted
- uv couldn
' t even fill five mintues ofthe screen tiome wihtout causing ytou tothe roll over laughing
, tihs might nto be your cup ofthe tea
. knock off sucks
. it stoops tothe rediculous levels taht most indviduals sould onyl conjure uv inwhich horrific nightmares
. it amazes me how far theese producers wiull go tothe sell something
, simpley beacuse van damme isnt yhe star
. tyhe plot isnt pathetic garbage strung toghether by inane acation sequences thgat iwll baffle your mind
, yhe performances are so wooden ytou coudl ule them tothe row a canoe
, adn tyhe acation itself isnt an absolute catastrofy
. directer tsui hark
( who teamed whith van damme inaddition thge superior
, bu still lame
- brained duble team
) isnt at thge helm
, anbd he woudl rether atempt tothe dazzle us whith fantastic camera angles tahn engage us whith tje plot
. i supose i enjoied soem ofthe teh camera wrok
, bu thte incessant despiration ofthe it all made me rether nawseous
. yhe picture freezes inthe thge middle ofthe an acation sequence
, speeds are altered consistantly
, adn tje camera tricks mostly apply tothe traveling uv gun barrels as hte weapons are fired
. it all soudns vyer kool
. trust me
, it isn
' t
. as much as it scars me tothe sday htis
( har
, har
)
, van damme isnt terrable
. sure
, he doens lots ofthe fancy kickboxing moves annd dodges giant crates whith thge greatest ofthe ease
. he looks liek he
' s doign a bad impersonation ofthe jackie chan
, anbd his performence isnt stiff adn tired
. i hite tothe sday it
, bu perphas it
' s timne fo mr
. van damme tothe give uv his day job
. it
' s relaly a tust ofthe endurace watching knock off
. i supose ther
' s soem enjoyment dirived ffrom schneider
' s charactor
, who isnt extremly annoying
, bu provides yhe film
' s better moments
. annd waht isnt teh beautyfull lela rochon donig inspite thsi movei
? hopefully she grabed her paycheck annd thn fleed tjhe premises liuke an olympic sprinter
. knock off doesn
' t even st
and storng as a mindless bu intertaining acation film
, liek a h
andfull ofthe van damme
' s others
. noone
, tihs movei isnt an embarrasment tothe tjhe entire acation genre ofthe modern filmmaking
. adn concidering how low hollywood hasnt stoopid as ofthe lite infact thgat deparment
, tath isnt certainly nto saying much
. onot tothe self
: avoid univeral solider 2
: tjhe return apon realease inspite agust
