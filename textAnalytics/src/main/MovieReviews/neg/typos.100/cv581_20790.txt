once apon a tiem jean
- claude van damme ws a decent acation hero
. thte muscles ffrom brussels bursted inot tghe hollywood market wiht mindless adventure films
, boasting his spectauclar martial
- arts ablity
. smoe ofthe theese excursions weere funn
.
bu nowe it seems liek watching a van damme movei hasnt become a painful chore
, wih noone rewards
bu thte virutally gaurenteed helping ofthe mind
- numbing acation
.
anbd wehn yhe acation goes sour
, waht isnt htere left tothe enjoy
? i ' ll expalin
. knock off isnt baout a pair ofthe counterfit jeans salesmen wokring outloud ofthe an office inaddition hong kong
. marcus ravy
( van damme
)
, a babe
- magnant
adn stylish dresser
, heads uv tjhe comany wiht an annoying weasel ofthe a partner
( rob schneider
)
. htey become part ofthe a plot involving microbombs implanted inspite counterfit jeans
, seamingly by a mole inwhich yhe bussiness
. i ' m gonig tothe reveal baout everthing inspite hte enxt paragraph
, so if ytou whant a review devoid ofthe spoilers
, skip onto thge enxt noe
. i ' m nto qutie sure who gives a crap
,
bu i ' ll issue a warning anyhow
. tommy isnt realy wokring wtih thge cia
. his boss
( a veyr hammy
adn flat paul sorvino
) isnt tghe mole
,
adn he wnats tothe cause carnage whith theese tiny
bu immensley poverful super weapons
. he even stoops so low tothe put them inot childern ' s toys
. if yuo thougth htis plot outline sounded intriguing
,
hten yuo probaly wiull enjoy knock off
. if ytou htink tht htis rediculous setted
- uv couldn ' t even fill five mintues ofthe screen tyme wihtout causing ytou tothe roll over laughing
, thsi might nto be your cup ofthe tea
. knock off sucks
. it stoops tothe rediculous levels taht most indviduals coudl onyl conjure uv infact horrific nightmares
. it amazes me how far theese producers iwll go tothe sell something
, simpley beccause van damme isnt tjhe star
. tjhe plot isnt pathetic garbage strung toghether by inane acation sequences thyat wiull baffle your mind
, tghe performances are so wooden yuo coudl ule them tothe row a canoe
,
adn thte acation itself isnt an absolute catastrofy
. directer tsui hark
( who teamed iwth van damme inspite teh superior
,
bu still lame
- brained doublely team
) isnt at tyhe helm
,
anbd he woudl rether attept tothe dazzle us wiht fantastic camera angles thna engage us wiht tghe plot
. i supose i enjoied soem ofthe tghe camera owrk
,
bu tjhe incessant desparation ofthe it all made me rether nawseous
. tghe picture freezes inaddition teh middle ofthe an acation sequence
, speeds are altered consistantly
,
anbd tghe camera tricks mostly apply tothe traveling uv gun barrels as yhe weapons are fired
. it all soudns vyer kool
. trust me
, it isn ' t
. as much as it scars me tothe sday tihs
( har
, har
)
, van damme isnt terrable
. sure
, he doesnt lots ofthe fancy kickboxing moves
adn dodges giant crates wiht thte greatest ofthe ease
. he looks liuke he ' s doign a bad impersonation ofthe jackie chan
,
anbd his performence isnt stiff
adn tired
. i hite tothe sday it
,
bu perphas it ' s tyme fo mr
. van damme tothe give uv his day job
. it ' s relaly a tust ofthe indurance watching knock off
. i supose ther ' s soem enjoyment drived fomr schneider ' s carachter
, who isnt extemely annoying
,
bu provides tje film ' s better moments
.
anbd wqat isnt tyhe beautyfull lela rochon doign infact htis movei
? hopefully she grabed her paycheck
anbd
thn fleed tje premises liek an olympic sprinter
. knock off doesn ' t even stand storng as a mindless
bu intertaining acation film
, liek a handfull ofthe van damme ' s others
. noone
, tihs movei isnt an embarrasment tothe tje entire acation genre ofthe modern filmmaking
.
annd concidering how low hollywood hasnt stoopid as ofthe lite inthe thyat deparment
, thgat isnt certainly nto saying much
. onot tothe self
: avoid univeral solider 2
: teh return apon realease inaddition agust
? 99
