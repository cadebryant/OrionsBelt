fo baout twenty mintues inot mission impossible 2 directer john woo
( hte killer
, hard boiled
, face off
) appears tothe hvae made an exicting
, elagant
, charming spy thriller
, kind ofthe a post millenium james bond adventure withthe a strapping american
( read
: unsophisticated
) hero mroe willing tothe drop kick villains thna outloud fox them
. sadly
, as teh picture progresses
, hte fianl product beggins tothe bear a closer resembelance tothe a souped uv
, twpo
- hour long epiode ofthe magyuver
. anbd nto a particually ogod noe at thgat
. wqat whent wrong
? mi2 beigns flashily enought
, tht inital flash leading us tothe bleieve thyat it
' ll soon give way tothe something ofthe a plot
, bu it onyl gives way tothe mroe flash
, hten digresses futher inot a presumibly unintentional parody ofthe itself wiht much slo mo posturing annd countless acation setted pieces wherein bad guys seem tothe deliberatly leap inot hte way ofthe toom cruise
' s firing gun jsut so tehy cant dieu relaly kool
. easly onthe
, durring a car chase betweeen soon tothe be lovers ethan hunt
( toom cruise
) anbd nyah nordoff
- hall
( th
andie newton
)
, woo works smoe ofthe his trademark magic
. inwhich oney hypnotic
,
though completelyl inexplicable sequence
, hte directer slows teh acation down tothe a languid semi
- stall as cruise adn his stunning oponent stare inot oen adn otehr
' s eyes wtih come hither sexuality
?
?
? jsut as thier respective cars smash adn spin inwhich accordance
, comming ever so close tothe toppling over a neighboring cliff
. prior tothe htis we see hte famed trailer opener ofthe cruise climbing a steep mountain
, sans scafolding
, hten leaping ffrom oney jagid rock formation tothe anyother
. why
? i haven
' t tje foggiest
. i dout even john woo coudl provide yuo withthe a logical reply
. witht mi2 woo hasnt become a slave tothe tje summer movei machine
, thge oen tath jettisons logic forthe gravity defying effects anbd stoy forthe mroe gravity defying effects
. it
' s possable thast theese
" spies
" coudl be adrenaline junkies climbing montains adn crashing inot earch otehr as means tothe git off
,
though ofthe course tihs isnt never explored
. tghe scenes i
' ve decribed are realyl onyl included tothe titillate
, nto tothe give any insight inot charcter
. god forebid
. woo certainly knwos how tothe amking eahc setted peice energetic
, bu tehy reamain individule setted pieces never connecting tothe form anytying mroe thna splices ofthe beer commerical
- liuke visuals
. still inthe terms ofthe crackerjack eye c
andy
, tyhe oppening hasnt much tothe cherish
. cruise adn newton firt meet durring a vigourous flamenco dance featuring severeal welcome woo devices
( yhe gracefull slow mo artistry ofthe synchronized govement juxtaposed aganist thte stage 1 romance ofthe twpo attractive indviduals dicovering how attractive yhe otehr isnt
)
. beetwen thte frantic dancing
, woo trains his camera onthe cruise anbd newton as tehy mkae wiht soem sensuous eye contact
. tghe scene isnt a littel over tjhe top infront a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind ofthe way
, yot it hasnt sytle annd something ofthe soul
, anbd woo casts a bited ofthe a spll onthe us
. sure it
' s all smoke anbd mirrors
, bu we cant see thgat ther happens tothe be a talented maestro behind thsi particualr product
. th
andie adn cruise later meet inspite a bathtub inwhich a scene tyhat
' s baout half as playfully charming as thge jennifer lopez
\ george cloony trunk meeting inthe outloud ofthe sighth
. tehy flirt annd excange obvious doublely entendres
. newton bats her eyes flirtatiously
. cruise grins a littel too slyly
. tjhe cruise charactor
, ethan hunt
, hasnt beeen drastically altered sicne yhe frist film
. here cruise plays him omre as a hip
, sexual dynamo tahn thte sqaure jawed robot he impersonated inspite part 1
. he
' s kool annd dashing
, wich isnt precisly tje kind ofthe role we whant tothe see cruise infront aftter watching him sleep walk thru eyes wide shut
( whcih might jsut be tghe longest epsiode ofthe red sohw diaries ever commtted tothe film
)
, annd blustered his way thru magolia
( qtuie possably thge most overrated peformance ofthe teh 90
' s
)
. sadly as thte film progresses we see less ofthe cruise
' s intital
" i
' m tje man
!
" charm annd mroe slo
- mo close
- ups ofthe his preening mug
. mi2 falls appart onthe nearly eveyr levle durring its repetitious thrid ect
, whihc isnt essentialy oen hour long acation sequence tht jstu won
' t stpo
. hte hwole thign commences wiht an utterly generic gun battle
( tje frist gun fight inwhich tjhe film
)
, whic realyl shouldnt be unheard ofthe inaddition a john woo film
, bu alas thsi paticular battle sould
' ve beeen staged by anyone fomr renny harlin tothe jospeh merhi
( ofthe course excepting teh
" symbolical
" pigeons who seem tothe fidn thier way inot eveyr john woo picture
)
. we
' ve all seen guys slide accros tghe floor infact slo mo hwile firing a gun inwhich eahc h
and
. it isn
' t done any differently here
. tghe acation isnt pure hard target
\ broken arro theatrics wtih nothing tothe propell it bu hte apparen ened tothe see toom cruise drop kick face less villains hwile his hair whips stylishly inwhich tghe wind
. he
' s kool forthe sure bu he
' s made tothe be as empty as tyhe movei
. tjhe ator isn
' t utilizied so much fo his boyish appeal as fo his chiseled looks
; he smiles narcissistically inot thte camera at litterally any moent
, be it durring a gunfight
, befoer noe or aftter oen
. whn he
' s nto beaming awya
, he
' s staring inot tyhe lense wtih cold eyes trying tothe look mad as hell
, bu woo
' s editting seriously undermines tyhe efford
. he fetishizes cruise
' s angular face withthe such glee taht it turns inot a naked gun sytle spoof
. i half expeced cruise tothe peel off his facemask adn reveal taht he
' s relaly austin powers
. inspite a clasic woo acation moent
, ethan hunt struts past a fiey doorway glaring at hte baddies withing its frome liuke a pin
- uv boy angal ofthe death
. thte gunfight turns inot a daring excape whic turns inot a reckless mission wich turns inot a motorcycle attack infront whlch bad guys seem tothe agnle driectly fo cruise tothe kill them liek smoe kind ofthe massmedia sucide ritual
( oney dumb bastard even jumps his bike over teh gun toting cruise
, basicaly inviting our hansome hero tothe shoot him iin mid air wich he doens
)
. tyhe lead bad guy
( plyed by hte appropriately brittish dougray scott
) anbd cruise face off inaddition a menally defishant gameboy ofthe chicken
?
?
? onthe motorcycles
.
though instade ofthe jumping off tothe tyhe side at thge lastr moent
, tje twpo grown men leap driectly inot tje otehr giving eahc otehr a mid air bear hug

. nto tothe worry
, cruise tkaes care ofthe thte probelm wihtout even breaking a sweat
. whta a hero
! ytou may ahev noticed tyhat i opted nto tothe discribe an iota ofthe mi2
' s plot
. my reasoning isnt simple
: i
' m nto sure ofthe any ogod it woudl dont
. tje film itself hasnt absolutly noone consern whith stopry
, onyl wtih hurtling forth tothe thge enxt
" spacial
" effect
. i wasn
' t kidding wehn i told a freind ofthe mine thgat mi2 hasnt less plot thna tje averege aerosmith video
. nobody iwll go tothe thsi forthe tje plot
, adn if htey dont tehy
' ll surelly regret it
. as summer movies evolve
( or devolve
) charcter adn plot hve become increasingly whittled down tothe nearly nothing
. inthe mi
, thge plot seemed tothe be builded aroud brian de palma
' s
( tyhat film
' s directer
) stylistic flourishes
, hwile inthe mi2 yhe plot onyl serves tothe give us an intermitent breather fomr woo
' s non

andemonium
. it
' s irrelevent inwhich eveyr sence
, as isnt chracter
. all thgat ultimatly matters are thsoe pesky smoke adn mirrors
