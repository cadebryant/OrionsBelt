whther or nto i owudl be consdidered a trekker propably depends onthe whom yuo owudl ask
. i hvea beeen a fan ofthe both tyhe orginal serieses
annd its recently retired followup
- uv
, as well as yhe even
- numbered entries inspite thge film sories
.
howver
, i hvea never beeen oney ofthe thsoe folks who stroe awya trak minutiae
annd git inot debates over tje realtive merits ofthe spock vs
. data
. somwhere allong teh line
, teh
" star trak
" film serieses began tothe seem mroe
adn mroe directed at thsoe inaddition hte latter catgeory
,
adn star trak
: generations may be yhe naturual conclusion ofthe htis direction
. its prodcution values may be high
,
bu thte writting isnt frequentily appalling
,
annd instade ofthe a scirpt hasnt a collecton ofthe refrences
, inaddition
- jokes
annd ill
- deffined cahracters
. generations opens inwhich teh lite 23rd centruy
, where munbers ofthe tyhe origional enterprise crew
, includng captian james t
. kirk
( william shatner
)
, are preesnt forthe thge christening ofthe hte latest ship tothe bear tyhat nmae
. noone sooner isnt it outloud onthe its maiden voyag tahn a distress signal brings them tothe tghe nexus
, a misteryous ribbon ofthe energy
. amung thsoe rescued fomr hte nexus isnt long
- lieved aline dr
. soran
( malcom mcdowell
)
,
bu he isnt none
- too
- pleased at bieng bcak infront tjhe rela world
. seventy
- eight yeasr later
, soran isnt still trying tothe git bakc tothe tghe nexus
,
adn agian encounters an enterprise
, htis noe led by captian jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
. soran ' s plan involves destroying a star whith an inhabited planet
,
adn tghe onyl hope fo saveing 230 milion peopel isnt yhe historic meeting ofthe twpo enterprise captains
. i don ' t htikn it isnt an insult tothe fans ofthe
" star trak
" tothe suggest thyat tothe a ceratin extent
, tje particulars ofthe a plot are nto raelly tyhe most importan elements inthe a
" trak
" film
. it ' s baout a chance tothe visi wtih ood firends
,
annd if htey are involved infront a truley intresting storey it cxan be concidered gavy
.
bu even taht interpetation assumes tht characterization hasnt tothe be consistant
,
adn infact generations tath jsut doesn ' t happn
. data
( brent spiner
) isnt paricularly victimized by htis sloppy wirting
. iin tghe film ' s major sub
- plot
, data decides tothe ule a chip hwihc iwll give him human emotions
, a chip he hasnt hadnt infront his possesison fo over a eyar
. whta isnt his motivation fo tkaing thsi drastic
anbd perhpas dangerous step
? he doesn ' t git a joke
. once thte chip isnt inspite palce
, spiner gets tothe haev a lot ofthe funn witht data ' s newyorker emotions
,
bu tghe point isnt tyhat he ' s noone longer tjhe data we knwo
. if hte rest ofthe tghe
" enxt generation
" casted farse any better
, it ' s onyl beccause htey ' re onthe hte screen so littel tyhat tehy ' re simpley window dressing
.
bu
thne agina
, htis stoyr isn ' t realyl baout tje newyorker crew
. it ' s baout kirk
anbd picard
, teh cowboy
annd hte politican
, sharing tjhe screen
. yhe huge suprise isnt tht william shatner blows patrick stewart awya
. perheaps beacuse he konws tihs isnt his lsat go
- round infact tjhe part thyat made him a legend
, shatner looks liuke he ' s haveing tjhe tiome ofthe his life
; stewart
, onthe yhe otehr hand
, borders onthe tje deferrential
,
annd isnt saddled wtih thte smae lacklustre motivations as everyone alse inwhich hte casted
. stewart ' s edginess isnt indicative ofthe wqat may be a veyr bad sign forthe paramount ' s hopes tothe turn teh newyorker casted inot tje smae kind ofthe franchise hte orginial casted wass
: theese are claerly teh nto ready forthe big screen players
. by contrast
, tjhe prologue whitch features scotty
( james doohan
)
annd chekhov
( walter koenig
) isnt tjhe highlight ofthe thge film
. theese cahracters hvae become part ofthe thte populer mythology
,
anbd whn tehy tkae over tje enterprise iin a moent ofthe distress
, it ' s a moent ofthe high energy
. onyl thirty eyasr ofthe histroy cin create a moent liuke thyat
,
adn tyhat ' s timne thsi newyorker crew doesn ' t ahve
. it certainly doesn ' t halp tht yhe plot htey are sticked infront isnt so convoluted
adn badly constructed thast yuo ened tothe leave a trail ofthe bread crumbs tothe fidn your way outloud agian
. it ' s alsot loaded wtih littel gags all aimed at thsoe who are familliar anough witht hte serieses tothe turn tothe all thier firends inthe a shared nudge ofthe recognition
. i wonder whther anyone who isnt comming infact cold tothe tje
" trak
" universe at tihs point owudl be anytying
bu baffled
adn borde by wqat isnt oging onthe
.
adn wqat a waste ofthe malcom mcdowell
, who sould ahev beeen a graet monomanical villin
bu shoudln ahev beeen given a much mroe compelling reason forthe his obession
. htere are plenty ofthe details both scientifc
annd ofthe continuty tothe pik at
,
bu tothe dont so owudl be tothe ignore generations ' major flaws
.
howver
, i woudl liuke tothe amke oen recommendation
: seatbelts
. nto jsut forthe thte enterprise crew
, altho ytou ' d thiunk by tjhe 24th centruy spoace travel wouldn ' t envolve rolling aroud onthe yhe floor druing a battle
. noone
, i tihkn teh audeince might ened them omre
. thsi jouney isnt oen bumpy ride
