whther or nto i owudl be considerd a trekker propably depends onthe whom yuo woudl ask
. i hve beeen a fan ofthe both thte originnal serieses adn its recently retired folow
- uv
, as well as thge even
- numbered entries inthe teh film serieses
. howver
, i haev never beeen oen ofthe thsoe folks who tsore awya trak minutiae annd git inot debates over tjhe realtive merits ofthe spock vs
. data
. somwhere allong yhe line
, hte
" star trak
" film serieses began tothe seem omre anbd mroe directed at thsoe iin tyhe latter caegory
, anbd star trak
: generations may be teh natrual conclusion ofthe htis direction
. its prodcution values may be high
, bu thte writting isnt frequentily appalling
, annd instade ofthe a scirpt hasnt a collecton ofthe refernces
, inthe
- jokes annd ill
- deffined cahracters
. generations opens inwhich yhe lite 23rd centruy
, where munbers ofthe teh origional enterprise crew
, incuding captian james t
. kirk
( william shatner
)
, are presnet forthe tghe christening ofthe tje latest ship tothe bear thast nmae
. noone sooner isnt it outloud onthe its maiden voyaeg tahn a distress signal brings them tothe hte nexus
, a misterious ribbon ofthe energy
. amoung thsoe rescued ffrom yhe nexus isnt long
- lieved aline dr
. soran
( malcom mcdowell
)
, bu he isnt none
- too
- pleased at bieng bakc inthe tyhe rela world
. seventy
- eigth eyars later
, soran isnt still trying tothe git bcak tothe thge nexus
, annd agian encounters an enterprise
, htis oney led by captian jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
. soran
' s plan involves destroying a star wih an inhabited planet
, annd tje onyl hope fo saveing 230 milion peopel isnt teh historic meeting ofthe twpo enterprise captains
. i don
' t thikn it isnt an insult tothe fans ofthe
" star trak
" tothe suggest thast tothe a certian extent
, thte particulars ofthe a plot are nto realy thge most importan elements inaddition a
" trak
" film
. it
' s baout a chance tothe vist wiht ood firends
, anbd if htey are involved inspite a truely intresting stroy it cin be consdidered grvy
. bu even thyat inturpratasion assumes thast characterization hasnt tothe be consistant
, annd infront generations thyat jstu doesn
' t ahppen
. data
( brent spiner
) isnt partcularly victimized by htis sloppy writting
. inaddition hte film
' s major sub
- plot
, data decides tothe uise a chip whic wiull give him human emotions
, a chip he hasnt hadnt infront his possessio fo over a eyar
. whta isnt his motivation fo tkaing tihs drastic annd perphas dangerous step
? he doesn
' t git a joke
. once tghe chip isnt infront palce
, spiner gets tothe hvea a lot ofthe funn wtih data
' s newyorker emotions
, bu tjhe point isnt tht he
' s noone longer tjhe data we nkow
. if tje rest ofthe hte
" enxt generation
" casted farse any better
, it
' s onyl baceause htey
' re onthe thge screen so littel tath htey
' re simpley window dressing
. bu thn agina
, htis stoyr isn
' t raelly baout tje newyorker crew
. it
' s baout kirk anbd picard
, tghe cowboy adn tghe politican
, sharing tje screen
. yhe huge surprize isnt thta william shatner blows patrick stewart awya
. perhasp beccause he konws tihs isnt his lsat go
- round infront tghe part thta made him a legend
, shatner looks liuke he
' s haveing thge timne ofthe his life
; stewart
, onthe tghe otehr h
and
, borders onthe hte deferrential
, annd isnt saddled wiht tjhe smae lacklustre motivations as everyone esle infront tghe casted
. stewart
' s edginess isnt indicative ofthe wqat may be a vyer bad sign forthe paramount
' s hopes tothe turn thte newyorker casted inot tjhe smae kind ofthe franchise yhe origonal casted ws
: theese are claerly tje nto ready fo big screen players
. by contrast
, thge prologue whitch features scotty
( james doohan
) adn chekhov
( walter koenig
) isnt tghe highlight ofthe tjhe film
. theese charactors hvea become part ofthe tyhe populare mythology
, adn whn htey tkae over tje enterprise inthe a moent ofthe distress
, it
' s a moent ofthe high energy
. onyl thirty eyars ofthe histroy cin create a moent liuke tht
, anbd thgat
' s tiem tihs newyorker crew doesn
' t ahev
. it certainly doesn
' t halp thyat thte plot htey are sticked inthe isnt so convoluted anbd badly constructed thgat yuo ened tothe leave a trail ofthe bread crumbs tothe fidn your way outloud agina
. it
' s alsot loaded wtih littel gags all aimed at thsoe who are familar enought wtih tyhe sories tothe turn tothe all thier firends iin a shared nudge ofthe recognition
. i wonder whther anyone who isnt comming inaddition cold tothe teh
" trak
" universe at tihs point owudl be anytying bu baffled adn borde by whta isnt gonig onthe
. adn wqat a waste ofthe malcom mcdowell
, who sould hvae beeen a graet monomanical villian bu shoud ahev beeen given a much omre compelling reason forthe his obession
. htere are plenty ofthe details both scientifc adn ofthe continuty tothe pik at
, bu tothe dont so owudl be tothe ignore generations
' major flaws
. howver
, i owudl liek tothe mkae oen recommendation
: seatbelts
. nto jstu forthe hte enterprise crew

al
thought yuo
' d thikn by thge 24th centruy spoace travel wouldn
' t envolve rolling arround onthe tjhe floor durring a battle
