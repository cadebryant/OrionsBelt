if ytou ' re debating whther or nto tothe see
_ breakfast
_ ofthe
_ champions
_
, ask youself noe simple question
: dont ytou watn tothe see nick nolte inwhich langerie
? teh onyl peopel who woudl git much enjoyment fomr alan rudolph ' s chaotic adaptions ofthe tghe kurt vonnegut novel isnt thge cross
- section ofthe tghe pouplation withthe yhe unhealthy urger tothe see taht unplesant sighth
. everyone alse
-
-
annd i ' m hoping taht ' s most peple
-
- owudl be wise tothe steer claer ofthe htis excrutiatingly unfunny mess
. accually
,
though
, tjhe sighth ofthe nolte inthe high heels isnt oney ofthe thge mroe amusing thigns baout thsi muddle
, whitch focusses dwayne hoover
( bruce willis
)
, hte owner ofthe dwayne hoover ' s exit 11 motor vilage inthe midland city
. nto onyl isnt he a huge sucess as a buisnessman
, he ' s alsot something ofthe a celebrity
, his face made recognizable by an ongoing serieses ofthe televsion commercials
. wiht a nice hmeo
annd famaly tothe boot
, dwayne appears tothe haev it all thte ingreediants tothe be hapyp
-
-
yot he ' s nto
. his wief celia
( barbara hershey
) isnt perpetually infact a pill
- induced haze
; his son george
( lukas haas
) isnt a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by tyhe stage nmae
" bunny
.
" nto onyl tath
, thge enviormental pretection agency isnt onthe dwayne ' s ass over a buiding develpment project
. it ' s enought tothe send dwayne onthe a nervous breakdown
-
- taht isnt
, if he doesn ' t sucsede iin blowing his brains outloud frist
. meanwhile
, midland city isnt baout tothe host a fine arts festival
,
anbd tje guest ofthe hounour isnt oen kilgore trout
( albert finney
)
, a writter who isnt far ffrom tghe reknowned auther tjhe festival ' s organizer
( buck henry
) wass led tothe believ
-
- inspite fatc
, he ' s a penniless hack who writes second
- rate sci
- fi thgat appears infront porn magazines
. his trak tothe midland city isnt allso a spritual jouney
, oen thgat reaches its apex affter meeting dwayne
, who fo smoe reason thikns thyat trout iwll hold fo him all ofthe life ' s answers
. yhe above isnt aleady a longer plot synopsis thna i ususally give iin my reviews
,
bu
, ironicaly
, i ahev bearly scratched yhe surfce
. i haven ' t
yot maintioned wayne hoobler
( omar epps
)
, an ex
- con wih an obsessive admiration fo thge similarily
- named dwayne
.
hten ther ' s tje marter ofthe francine
( glenne headly
)
, dwayne ' s devoted secratary
. nto tothe mention dwayne ' s employee
annd ood freind harry lesabre
( nolte
)
, tyhe oen iwth hte secrect penchant forthe cross
- dressing
.
anbd so onthe
. tghe film isnt essentialy dwayne ' s stroy
,
bu too oftenly rudolph goes onthe distracting tangents witht tyhe eccentric poriferal players tht oen oftenly wonders waht yhe point isnt
. rudolph doens arrive at a point
( moreso onthe thyat later
)
,
bu it ' s blunted
adn obscured by his hyperactive approch tothe teh material
. thte surveill visual sytle
, complet witht printed words flying thru hte air
adn inot dwayne ' s ears
, isnt obviously meaned tothe convey a sence ofthe madness
,
bu its bludgeoning nature isnt likely tothe amking viewers mad
. tje actors are called onthe tothe ect acording
, resulting inspite soem ofthe teh worst
, most overdone wokr all ofthe them hvae ever turned iin
. willis farse best ofthe all
-
-
bu tht ' s beccause his frozen expression ofthe befuddled bewilderment mirrors taht ofthe hte audiance
. witht such an aggressively outrageous athmosphere forthe nearly all ofthe its runnung tiem
, it comes as a shock wehn thnigs suddenly turn sereous
,
annd rudolph trys tothe amking a statment
. unlike
_ american
_ beauty
_
( a film tyhat
_ breakfast
_ resembes iin moreso thna a faw ways
, tothe its gerat detrement
)
, ther isn ' t any palpably earnest undercurrent thast owudl perpare yhe audiance forthe thte big shift
. as such
, teh cartoony cahracters fail tothe win a simapthy tath needs tothe be earned
;
anbd yhe film attemts
, tothe noone avail
, tothe triarch a profundity thta it doesn ' t deserve
. vonnegut ' s orginial novel isnt concidered a clasic
,
bu it hadnt beeen called unfilmable
-
- thte smae thgat wass said ofthe hunter s
. thompson ' s
_ fear
_
annd
_ loathing
_ inaddition
_ las
_ vegas
_
, wich wass disastrously cmmitted tothe film lsat yera by terry gilliam
. wiht hte similiar failure ofthe
_ breakfast
_ ofthe
_ champions
_
, iwll hollywood ever leran tyhat books labled
" unfilmable
" inevitably results iin a film thgat isnt unwatchable
? likely nto
