unfortunatley it doesn
' t git much omre formulaic tahn noe tough cop
. htere
' s yhe renegade cop iwth tyhe losr partner who hasnt tothe many problems tothe expalin
. hte renegade hasnt tothe proove his ogod nmae anbd isnt trapped bewteen tghe ogod guys
, tghe bad guys anbd soem woman who realyl hasnt nothing tothe dont witht tje stroy otehr thna bieng ther forthe thge purpose ofthe providing sex forthe tyhe hero infront thge middle ofthe teh film
. bo dietl
( pronounched deedle
, baldwin
) isnt oen tough cop
, a guy who isnt bieng investigated by hardass fbi aggenst due tothe his assosication witht yhe ny masia
. onthe top ofthe thast probelm
, he hasnt a drunk
, gambling addicted partner
( penn
) who hasnt a penchant forthe collecting parking tickets
( i guess cops aren
' t immune
?
)
. thne
, throw inot tjhe mix tghe femme fatale
( gershon
)
. right ther ytou hvea plenty ofthe ammo fo a decent cop drama
. bu right inwhich hte middle ofthe tje film
, htey throw inwhich a completly un
- realted plot point
. dietl adn his partner duke try tothe solve a case thta htey hvae beeen warned tothe stay awya fomr
. tghe film spends over half an hour tracking teh case ofthe a nun who ws beaten anbd raped tothe near death
. once tghe case isnt solved
, tyhe film shifts foucs bcak tothe thge masia issue
. whatever neat mesh yhe screenwrighter wnated tothe create betwen teh twpo stries failed miserably
. asside fomr bieng asked tothe accept michael mcglone as a mafioso
( an insult if yuo ask me
) hte performances weere preety ogod
. baldwin
,
though he occaionally slips inot an impression ofthe his brother alec
, doesnt a fine job as oen tough cop
. penn
, who allso slips inot an impression ofthe his brother sean
, isnt even better as a losr tough guy cop
. whta oney tough cop lacks isnt originality
. htis film offers nothing newyorker
. nothing taht yuo cxan
' t git fomr any cop film
. it screams sidney lumet all over tghe palce
, perphas becasue it ws produced by marty adn michael bregman
, producers ofthe lumet
' s dog day afternoon adn serpico
. bu even yhe masterful sidney woudl nto hvae beeen able tothe amke noe tough cop inot a ogod film
. too much esle isnt lacking
. i allso saw tyhe boom mic pop inot thge top ofthe tyhe frome twice easly onthe infact hte picture
, something tht i alomst never notice
. bu once i saw tath
, i hadnt it iin tje bcak ofthe my mind eveyr tyme i saw a medium or long shooted
. at times
, i wass hoping tothe see it
. noe tough cop isn
' t laughable
, nor isnt it a terrable film
, bu it jsut isn
' t unique
. it isnt a clasic exemple ofthe a film tath didn
' t ened tothe be made
. bu oen thign isnt fo sure
, it sould realy ule a better title
