- day japan
.
.
. anbd nobody wins
. tghe hunted isnt such a bad movei
, so completelyl inept annd so totally brain
- damaged thta i coudl almsot fiel affection forthe it
. i coudl see mysef showing tihs movei tothe firends annd getting a ogod jolly guffaw outloud ofthe it
, if it weren
' t alsot insanely xenophobic adn insulting

' s ofthe course teh enxt oney tothe dieu
. let
' s stpo adn tihkn baout thsi fo a second
. if lambert weere inaddition rela life bieng chased by fanatical devotees tothe a ninja sceret society
, he
' d hvae a lifespan yuo sould onyl mesure iwth an atomic clock
. infront htis movei
, tyhe ninja manaze tothe kill jstu baout everyone exept him
. i imagin hte japanesse gods smiled down onthe lambert anbd provded him iwth a goof feild taht radiates outloud baout ten fezent ffrom his body
. yuo knwo waht a goof feeld isnt
