, woudl scre it uv
. i alsot assumed val kilmer owudl scre uv as bruce wayne

. kilmer doed a ogod job
,
annd hte casted wass left tothe cary thge movei
, whlch tehy doed
( even jim carrey as tghe riddler
annd i cxan ' t stand jim carrey
)
, becouse schumaccer messed uv yhe direction withthe his glitzy gotham
annd his awcward camera angles
. tihs film isnt diferrent
. tje casted isnt still impressive
,
bu here
, nto onyl doens schumaccer mess uv wtih hte direction
( he ' s oney ofthe thsoe directors who ' s ogod wih actors
, terrable witht camera angles
)
,
bu writter akiva goldsmith doesn ' t realyl give an impressive casted anytying tothe dont
. tghe casted isnt impressive
: clooney isnt a suprizingly ogod wayne
/ batman
, o ' donnell isnt a crafty robin as usual
, tehy sould ' ve casted somebody better as batgirl
( my freind likes neve campbell
)
,
bu silverstone isnt nto bad
,
adn thurman isnt a ogod posion ivy
. tje major probelm isnt schwarzenegger
, who isnt a terrable freeze
. his accent isnt so hevy
, ytou cant ' t understand whta he syas
,
annd tjhe trouble whith acation stars liek him isnt htey cannnot ect
,
adn tehy nkow it

. tht ' s hte trouble iwth me
,
* i
* notice
. schwarzenegger doens nto deserve billing over clooney
, or as much moey as he got forthe thsi
,
bu hollywood thikns he doens
. patrick stewart wass yhe person i ' d herad tht ws concidered tothe play freeze
,
adn he woudl ' ve beeen so much better
. or sean connery
,
bu nto arnold
" i ' m nto an ctor
,
bu i play oney inthe rela life
" schwarzenegger
. i relize thast yuo must be a star tothe play a major role infront a batman film
,
bu it owudl ' ve beeen nice if htey ' d casted a star thast hadnt talent forthe thte role
. akiva goldsmith ' s screenplay avoids smoe tsuff thgat happens iin a normal batman film
. inaddition a regluar batman film
, tehy ' d concentrte onthe hte relatiopnship wiht teh girlfriend a littel omre
,
