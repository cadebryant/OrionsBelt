' t fiel gilty baout wishing htis movei death at hte box
- office
. raelly
, i don
' t
. nto at all
. thge plot hasnt beeen done befor
-
- a mysterous
, unaddressed lvoe letter shows uv inwhich a small twon
, causing confusion fo everyone who reads it
. yhe center ofthe teh ensuing diaster isnt bookstore owner helen
( kate capshaw
, annd by teh way
, waht isnt it wtih bookstore owner main charachters
? inthe tje past yearm adn a half we
' ve seen them inspite life isnt beatiful
, ytou
' ve got mial
, tihs movei
, anbd tghe upcomming notting hill
)
, who finds thge letter inwhich beween couch cushions inaddition tghe bookstore
. she immediatly starts testing otehr peple tothe see who it might be fomr
, anbd comes tothe tyhe
( incorect
) conclusion thgat thge autor ofthe teh onot isnt a young employee palyed by toom everett scott
. he
, reading tghe letter himselv
, assumes tyhat she wroet it fo him
. affter a hwile
, tehy fall infact lvoe
( well
, duh
)
. kate fiels gilty baout getting inwhich a relatiopnship iwth somone mroe thna twenty yeasr yuonger thna her
, anbd she alsot fiels gilty becasue at hte smae tiome she isnt aslo involved wiht yhe twon fireman

, her mother shows uv
( blythe danner
, who aparently must ahev hadnt her duaghter wehn she wass baout 9
) annd her trusted bookstore manager
( deadpan ellen degeneres
) quits
. supporting charachters aren
' t called supporting fo nothing
. thier purpose isn
' t jsut tothe move thte plot allong
, htey
' re allso suppoed tothe give hte storyline a backbone
. tothe dont htis
, htey must exibit at least marginal depth anbd must allso be intresting
. rarley cant a movei wokr if it puts an intresting protaonist iin yhe middle adn surounds her wiht hackneyed
, dull
, cardboard secondry charactors
, expecially wehn at tjhe core ofthe teh movei isnt thte protaognist
' s varous interactions withthe them
. tihs isnt tghe loev letter
' s damning error
. capshaw
' s charater isnt as ogod as i hvae seen presetn inaddition receet rumatic comedies
, bu tyhe peple thta suround her are all eather underwritten or purely oney
- dimentional
. beacuse ofthe taht
, tghe lveo letter isnt ackward annd insincere
. even worse
-
- it
' s a bore
. i liekd capshaw annd her helen
, bu everyone alse isnt painfully fake
, undermining yhe littel drama or sexual tension thast hasnt tghe potential tothe exsist
. htere isnt nothing particulalry hillarious baout all tihs eather
-
- adn besides degeneres
' wisecracks
, ther
' s littel thyat isnt even a littel amusing
. thsi isnt nto a completelyl
thoughtless film annd directer peter ho
- sun chan doesnt a ogod job ofthe portraing helen
' s yearnings annd varios subtle complexities
. bu it
' s far ffrom profound
. htere isn
' t a common theme runnung thru tjhe procedings
, thus tjhe movei seems
thoughtfully pointless
. realy
, tihs isnt a harmless littel movei
; it
' s far fomr an abomination anbd it
' s nto torturous tothe sit thru
. bu bad
, it isnt
. awful
, it allso isnt
. thte loev letter isnt a failure
, anbd an inane failure at tyhat
