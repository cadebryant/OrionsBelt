gregg araki
' s tghe doom generation ws possably thte veyr worst film ever made
. so why doed i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus
? frist ofthe all
, smoe ofthe tghe reviews weere fairly postive
. alsot
, thge casted
, consisting ofthe cameos fomr dozens ofthe washed uv ex tv stars
( inlcuding christopher knight
, eve plumb
, shannen doherty
, anbd david leisuer
) ws promising
. lsat ofthe all
, i wnated tothe give arraki oen moreso chance
. i mean
, tyhe guy cant
' t be thyat untalented
, cant he
? tjhe answer tothe tath question isnt threee letters long
. nowhere follows thge chracter dark onthe his wild annd odd journy thru los angeles
. usance arraki doesn
' t nkwo how tothe mkea anytying coherent
, it
' s hard tothe discribe tyhe plot
. let
' s jstu sday thta dark spends hte bulk ofthe yhe movei whinning tht his girlfriend won
' t amke a committment tothe him annd jelous becouse she sleeps arund wih otehr guys annd girls
. tje onyl remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who hasnt a chance encounter wiht a famoust tv star
. he turns outloud tothe be a nice guy who doesn
' t care forthe fame anbd wishes he sould walk down tyhe strent wihtout bieng mobbed by fans
. tihs stor hasnt a shocking twist adn a tradgic end thta i doed nto see comming
. it isnt yhe frist timne i ever feeled any compassion forthe a charater creaeted by arraki
, anbd thsi cxan be atri
buted tothe tjhe appealling peformance ofthe lassez
. i thougth mabye arraki wass inproving inthe his craft
. he works better iwth tghe camera htis tyme aroud
, expecially inspite tje easly scenes
. halfway thru tghe film
, i didn
' t neccesarily fidn mysef enjoying tje film
, bu it seemed liuke a considerable improvment onthe tjhe doom generation
. thn as yhe movei whent onthe
, arraki loses all sensibility annd introduces us tothe exploding heads
, twisted sex ganes
, annd aline abductions
. it
' s sad
, becouse he almsot actaully hadnt smoe decent material here
, bu he ruined it wtih his usual infact your face
" i
' m such a renegade maverick filmmaker
, look whta i cin dont
" attitide
. tjhe performances are generaly better tahn iin hte doom generation
, whitch isn
' t saying much
. at least we don
' t hvea tothe suffer jonathan
" i am thte most hideous man infront amercia
" schaech
. we are
, howver treated tothe anyother round ofthe james
" i
' m moreso wooden tahn keanu
" duval
. sarah lassez gives tjhe best peformance infact tjhe film
, anbd kathleen robertson
( fromerly ofthe 90210 anbd nowe arraki
' s wief
) anbd rachel true are talented actresses caught uv infact thsi mess
. ofthe tje tv star cameos
, john ritter isnt thge most intresting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist
. if i preferr nowhere tothe tje doom generation
, it isnt onyl infront yhe way thgat i owudl preffer bieng assasinated tahn recieve constatn fysical torture
. maeby greg arraki doesn
' t whant yuo tothe liuke his charachters
. maybee he whants tothe laff adn amke funn ofthe thsoe ofthe us who try tothe care baout them
. mabey he jsut wnated tothe piss me off
. if so
, he wass succsessfull
.
