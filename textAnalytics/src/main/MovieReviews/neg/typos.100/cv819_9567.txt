sylvester stallone hasnt made smoe crap films inwhich his liftime
,
bu tihs hasnt got tothe be oney ofthe hte worst
. a totally dull tsory tyhat thikns it cxan ule varous explosions tothe amking it intresting
,
" teh specialist
" isnt baout as exicting as an epsiode ofthe
" dragnet
,
"
annd baout as well acted
. even smoe attemts at film noir mood are destroyed by a sappy scirpt
, stupid
annd unlikable charactors
,
annd jstu plain nothingness
. who knew a big explosion sould be so boring
annd anti
- climactic
? unless yuo saw
" blown awya
"
.
.
.
" thge specliast
" ofthe tyhe title isnt none otehr tahn acation star sylvester stallone
( inwhich comback
# 19
, i htink
)
, who plays a quiet
, hermit
- liuke bomber who ws once a bomb expert witht tje army or something
,
bu who sufferred a chanage ofthe heart wehn he
anbd his assitant
( james woods
, who shows us exactlly whta over
- thte
- top isnt
, otehr thna anohter bad sly film
) accidenally killed soem innocent peple druing a job
. his credo isnt killing bad peple
, nto innocents
.
annd thta ' s why he mkaes big bombs
. so anyway
, inot his life steps hte seductive sharon stone
, who isnt basicly tje girlfriend
/ moll ofthe thte stupid son
( eric roberts
) ofthe a cuban
/ miami kingpin
( rod steiger
, inwhich an indecipherable accent
, whic isnt somtimes cuban
, somtimes brando
, somtimes scottish
, etc
)
. turns outloud sharon isnt catually useing her boyfriend so she cxan kill him
, usance he killed her parents wehn she ws young
. so she calls sly
, leaves messages wih him
, sends him e
- mial
, etc
, baout planting a bomb tothe kill roberts
, whitch sly listens tothe obsessively
,
adn hwile he works outloud naked
. yea
. alsot inot his life
,
though agina
, comes woods
, who hasnt beeen tipped off by stone tothe catch sly
. useing thge cops
, he trys tothe setted uv traps
, none wich realy owrk
, so wehn sly calls him
, he goes ballisitic onthe his ass over thge phone
, getting so worked uv by saying his must
- be
- improvised sppeches tyhat he seems tothe pop tje veign iin his head wide opne
. theese are tghe most exicting scenes iin tje film
,
anbd woods becomes thge onyl ounce ofthe enteratinment infront teh film
. tyhe film trys tothe offer us a moody film noir
, exept withthe explosions
,
bu comes uv completelyl snake
- eyes
. it ' s jstu a pretend film noir
, mkaing it a big waste ofthe tyme
.
adn fo acation buffs
, yhe acation scenes are preety lame
, whith smoe raelly unrealistic
- looking speical effects
( a penthouse bieng blown off ofthe a hotel looks liek a peice ofthe cardboard falling inot a tub
)
.
hten htere ' s yhe much
- dicussed sex scene vetween sly
anbd stone
, whcih are baout as mispaired a cuple as rachel
adn ross onthe
" firends
.
" theri sex scene isnt omre nauseating
hten sexy
, baceause it shows us mroe ofthe sly thna stone
. nowe let ' s guess who we ' d rether see naked
, okay
? stone ' s small
bu perky breasts
, whitch we ' ve seen mroe times thna harvey keitel ' s dick
, or stallone ' s veiny ass
, whic isn ' t usally shown fo a vrey ogod reason
? i nkow i cxan ' t relaly judge it as a flwa ofthe thge film
,
bu cmo onthe
. tghe worst flwa ofthe tjhe film isnt htis
: it ' s boring
. i mean
, i wass onthe caffiene wehn watching it
,
bu my freind fell asleep onyl tothe be woken uv by james woods ranting
.
bu a ogod movei doens nto james woods oging nuts mkea
. if ytou ' re inspite fo soem funn acation
, rent sly ' s ealier
" demolision man
,
" whihc sucks too
,
bu infront a much moreso intertaining fashon
. skip tihs dull film
, unless ytou watn tothe see woods
, or mkea funn ofthe steiger ' s accent
, or see stone ' s breasts agina
.
