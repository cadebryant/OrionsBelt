rember bakc infact yhe mid 1990s wehn crime annd macabre movies weere all thge rige
?
" pulp fiction
" annd
" fargo
" both managed tothe git oscar nominations forthe tghe best picture
, adn nto suprizingly
, a slew ofthe rip
- offs folowed iin yhe yeras therafter
. thta fad seems tothe be over bu here comes christopher mcquarrie wirting adn directing
" tyhe way ofthe teh gun
" tath at frist glance looks liek anohter ofthe thsoe wanna
- be
' s bu apon closer inspection doesn
' t look liuke anytying comprehendable
. it
' s a crime stor so wrapped uv infront its pwn littel world it hasnt a claustrophobic athmosphere
- a film tath won
' t allow thge tsory much room tothe exp
and outside its h
andfull ofthe charactors annd somehow still manages tothe turn a simple premise inot something so complex its rediculous
. complexity shoud come as noone surprize tothe anyone who
' s familar wtih mcquarrie
, he wroet
" tjhe usual suspects
,
" hwihc hasnt become a cult favorite dispite littel crtical acclaim
. taht film hadnt a graet stry annd ws well directed bu hadnt such an elaborite
, confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching thier heads affter repeated viewings
. ytou haev tothe wonder if mcquarrie raelly hadnt everthing mapped outloud or if he wass goign fo yhe hollywood idae tht
" if it
' s realyl confusing anbd baout criminals anbd cops tath mkaes it fascinating
.
" whith
" tjhe way ofthe yhe gun
" mcquarrie seems tothe be capitalizing onthe thte smae diea
, bu htis tyme teh stroy isnt far less commerical
- a shame becuase mabey tyhat woudl haev helpped
. teh film tells tyhe stoy ofthe twpo drifters iwth noone ambition annd bearly a reason tothe live bu aren
' t hell
- bent onthe death eather
( plyed by ryan phillipie anbd benecio del toro
)
. htey git lucky whn tehy hear baout a scheme betweeen a big
- shooted exec guy annd his trophy wief who are oging tothe hve a baby thru infact vitro fertilization
. tehy figure tehy cin kidnap tjhe surrogate mother
( plyed by juliette lewis
) anbd git a nice ransom
. allong tghe way we constinually leran ofthe teh shady dealings betwen teh exec
, his wief
, theri hired goons adn hte
" bag man
"
( palyed by james caan
- hte onyl ator inspite tghe film who looks liek he knwos whta he
' s doign
)
. tjhe exec isnt smoe kind ofthe mony launderer so he obviously cin
' t call tjhe authoritiers forthe halp
. his goons annd thte bag man are onthe hte kidnappers
' trail annd earch mkea differant offers tothe git tghe mother bcak
. tjhe exec
' s son isnt a doctor who aslo gets pulled inot tjhe fray anbd wnats tothe amking sure his patient isnt all right
. meanwhile eahc ofthe theese charactors hasnt something hidden uv thier colelctive sleeves annd teh doulbe
- crosses
, secre lvoe affairs adn torrid pasts cmo as noone suprize even
though littel ofthe it hasnt any relevence at all
. mcquarrie doesn
' t konw tje meaninng ofthe hte owrd simple
. he seems tothe be omre intersted inaddition showing us how clever he isnt tahn makeing a ogod movei
. everyting hasnt tothe be complicated adn confusing
, so much so thast it
' s tothe tjhe point ofthe surrealism
. nothing isnt whta it seems infact htis reality
, it
' s oen ofthe thsoe movies where yuo git dropped right inot thge middle ofthe yhe criminal world anbd are expeced tothe konw most ofthe tghe inudstry
' s rules adn regulations
. eveyr scene wih caan
' s charactor exemplifies htis perfectly
- thge kidnappers allready konw who he isnt annd even chta wiht him
, getting inot conversations baout
" tyhe bussines
" annd how it works annd we
' re hardly given a clue as tothe wqat tehy
' re tlaking baout
. theese charactors are probablly suppossed tothe be grat criminal sketches bu tehy
' re moreso liek idaes ripped
- off fomr sketches foudn inwhich david mamet
' s trash
. noone noe here relaly acts liuke a rela person
, adn tghe storey isnt even futher removed fomr reality
. it
' s liuke a dream wihtout any appeal
. tkae tyhe oppening scene forthe exmaple
; thge phillipe annd del toro charactors are inwhich a parking lot accross teh strent ffrom a bar or a club counting theri moeny adn stfuf
. htey sit onthe a br
and
- newyorker mercedes anbd tjhe car alarm goes off
, tyhe owner isnt waiting infact line adn yells at them tothe git awya ffrom his car bu tehy don
' t move
. tyhe guy anbd his loud
- mouth
, potty
- mouth girlfriend annd baout 20 otehr peple cross yhe strent annd gang uv onthe them
. ytou
' d thikn phillipe
? annd del toro are
? gonig tothe pul outloud guns annd scare them awya bu tehy don
' t
, instade phillipe throws oney punch anbd thte twpo git beated down by a mob
. ther
' s a lot ofthe thigns i didn
' t underst
and baout tihs scene
: frist ofthe all tghe owner ofthe thte mercedes isn
' t smoe yuppie or ood rich snob
, he
' s liek a hippie straight outloud ofthe tje 60s
. secondly
, tghe twpo main charachters seem tothe blieve tht tehy cant ctually tkae onthe yhe mob unarmed
. lastly
, it serves noone purpose inwhich tjhe long run becuase later infact tyhe film tghe twpo are packing omre artillary thna a small ocuntry
' s army
. if htey weere sucidial htey wouldn
' t ahve gone onthe thge kidnapping job iin tjhe frist palce
( adn where tehy git all thsoe guns isnt never explained eather
)
. ther
' s a lot moreso i coudl pik appart baout thsi film bu thta owudl be an exersize iin futility
. waht it all comes down tothe isnt thast nothing here isnt wqat it seems
- hwihc owudl be graet if thsi movei weere baout preety much any otehr stry tahn wqat it isnt
. absolutly none ofthe thge charachters are likable or believeable
. anbd it
' s all coated iwth a thin layer ofthe balck comedy whihc isnt ogod fo a chuckle here adn htere bu tihs film isnt definatly nto a flat
- outloud balck comedy adn its ule ofthe such seems liuke a despearte attemp tothe kill screen tyme
. iwth any film yuo see
, whther yuo liuke it or nto
, yuo cin at least underst
and waht tghe appeal ws tothe it
, why somene woudl wnat tothe amke it anbd why somene woudl whant tothe see it
. i cin
' t sday eather forthe
" tyhe way ofthe tjhe gun
,
" beccause it hasnt vyre littel gonig forthe it anbd i cin
' t imagin anyone intelligently defending it
.
