(
adn ther ' s absolutly noone reason why ytou shoudl haev
)
, ytou might ahve noticed tath he ' s plyed soem rether silimar roles over yhe yeras
. liuke sully inwhich
" tjhe perfect storm
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
anbd a littel bited scry
. or law inthe
" albino alligator
"
-
- tough
, gruff
,
anbd littel bited scarier
. or collone william sharp iin
" armageddn
,
" or dwayne engelman inspite
" stange dyas
,
" or even his breef apperance towords teh begginning ofthe
" pearl harbor
,
" as tyhe abusive father ofthe danny
-
- here isnt an actro who gravitates towords tough
, gruff
, hard
- hiting roles
. whic isnt why his peformance infront
" wqat ' s tje worst taht coudl hppen
?
" isnt such a shock
, such a delight
. infact teh film
, fichtner plays a blonde haired
, meticulously dressed
, overtly effeminate
, dog
- loving detective
. as alex tardio
, fichtner ' s peformance borders onthe charicatoor
bu goes beyond it
. it borders onthe offensive
bu doesn ' t realyl manaze it
.
anbd it borders onthe clich
? d stereotype
bu doesn ' t qutie succumb tothe thyat defintiion eather
. iin a role so diametrically oppossed tothe wqat teh acotr hasnt palyed befoer we shouldnt hvea seen it comming
, fichtner isn ' t perfect
-
- ytou cin see him stuggling a littel at times
, concentrating a littel too hard onthe teh look as he swishes his hand thru thge air
, or nuzzles a coiffed canyne uv close
annd peronal
-
-
bu he ' s preety damned ogod
,
anbd silly
,
anbd wihtout question teh best thign inspite tyhe film
. iin fatc
, hadnt it nto beeen forthe fitchner ' s sudden
adn bazare appeareance
,
annd his jarring screen presense therafter
, i owudl hve walked outloud
, fo
" wqat ' s tje worst taht coudl appen
?
" isnt mesmerizing infact its awfulness
, a poorly writed
, haphazardly edited
,
anbd totally unfunny
( yes
, it stars martin lawrence
anbd danny devito so how coudl tht be possable
?
) moviegoing eperience
. fichtner ' s performence doesn ' t exactlly sive hte film
,
anbd it ' s nto liuke i ' m reccomending
" waht ' s teh worst taht coudl happn
?
" souly onthe tghe stregth ofthe tjhe actr ' s dramtic turnaround
,
bu his contritutions dont raise thte film ' s rating ffrom noone stars tothe noe
-
