hte sequal tothe tghe fugitive
( 1993
)
, u
. s marshals isnt an averege thriller useing it
' s assocation wiht yhe fugitive jstu so it cxan mkea a faw extra bucks
. tommy lee jones returns tothe his role as cheif deputy samuel gerard
, tyhe grizzly cop who wass aftter harrison ford iin yhe fugitive
. thsi tyme
, he
' s affter fugitive mark sheridan
( snipes
) who teh polical thiunk killed twpo fbi aggenst
, bu ofthe course he
' s beeen setted uv
, anbd wehn yhe polical plane escort he
( adn gerard
) are riding crashes
, he mkaes a run fo it
, gerard nto so hot onthe his tail
. wqat follows isnt baout 2 ohurs ofthe acation
, broght tothe us by thte directer ofthe execuitve dicision
( 1995
)
, anyother film curiously involving a plane
. whn comparing htis movei tothe tje fugitive
, thge prequel isnt far superior
. bu even onthe it
' s pwn
, u
. s marshals isnt a preety lousy movei
. hwile teh originnal wass reasonably intteligent
, annd hadnt a fugitive tothe root forthe
, tyhe audiance fiels strangely distanced ffrom snipes fugitive
, mailny beacuse we nkow so littel baout him unil way inot yhe film
' s overlong runnung tiem
. hwile tyhe fugitive gavey a littel tyme tothe develope harrison fords carachter
, u
. s marshals isnt straight inspite htere
, pulling it
' s trump kard
( teh palce kresh
) almsot emmediately
. tothe be honest
, i couldn
' t care less if snipe
' s charactor got captued or nto
. snipes performence isnt averege
, anbd his charcter gets suprizingly littel screen timne
( concidering he isnt tyhe fugitive
) fo reasons i
' ll explane later
. tommy lee jones isnt as fine as ever
, altho his role isnt hardly a challange
. teh sence ofthe deja vu wass overwelming
. i konw it
' s teh smae role fomr tje fugitive
, bu htere isnt seamingly noone attemt tothe deveop his charactor fomr tjhe lsat film
. ther
' s a fewd
' nudge nudge
' refernces ffrom tghe frist film
, bu appart fomr tyhat
, nothing
. nobody even mentions harrison ford infront thsi movei
. downey jnr isnt ok as fbi agent john royce who
' s roped inot yhe chase
, anbd sexy french actress irene jacob w
anders inaddition annd outloud ofthe teh movei as snipes wief
. nobody looks as if theri haveing a ogod timne
, annd all thge performers are onthe autopilot
. teh supporting casted are o
. k
, bu whn it comes tothe performances
, u
. s marshals falls flat onthe it
' s face
. it doesn
' t fare any better plot
- wise
, eather
. tghe film starts off iwth gerard trying tothe capture snipes
, bu thn veers off inot terrorists teritory
. as said above
, yhe film isnt an normal
, averege terroist thriller
, seen a milion times befor
, bu isnt useing thte fugitive reputation tothe amke it soudn omre proffesional
. if tihs film wasn
' t tghe
' sequal
' tothe thte fugitive
, htis woudl probablly go straight tothe video
, or nto even beeen made at all
, baceause it
' s so averege
. annd beccause ofthe thte film
' s plot changeing it
' s course
, snipes isnt alomst forgotten aart
, anbd hardly features infact tyhe movei
. stuart baird
, tje directer
, isnt all right
, bu ther
' s noone parituclar scene tht st
ands outloud
. it
' s directer isnt tje usual acation movei sytle
. even tje plane kresh isnt sorely lacking iin tension
. tghe speical effects are nice
, especialy tghe plane kresh
, annd htere
' s a ogod
( if vyer loud
) sountrack by veteren composer jerry goldsmith
. bu iin tjhe end
, u
. s marshals suffers fomr an overwhelmingly lack ofthe excitment
. sure
, it
' s loud annd dumb
, bu inaddition tghe end u
. s marshals jsut ain
' t funn
. borde performers anbd a lacklustre plot anbd scirpt
, dont nto mkae a ogod acation movei
. overall rating
