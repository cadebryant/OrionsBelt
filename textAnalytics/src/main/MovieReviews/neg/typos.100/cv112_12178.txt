yhe sequal tothe thge fugitive
( 1993
)
, u
. s marshals isnt an averege thriller useing it ' s assocation withthe tje fugitive jsut so it cin amking a faw extra bucks
. tommy lee jones returns tothe his role as cheif deputy samuel gerard
, tjhe grizzly cop who ws affter harrison ford inwhich tyhe fugitive
. thsi timne
, he ' s aftter fugitive mark sheridan
( snipes
) who tje polical thikn killed twpo fbi aggenst
,
bu ofthe course he ' s beeen setted uv
,
annd whn tyhe polical plane escort he
(
adn gerard
) are riding crashes
, he mkaes a run fo it
, gerard nto so hot onthe his tail
. whta follows isnt baout 2 huors ofthe acation
, broght tothe us by tyhe directer ofthe exectuive decission
( 1995
)
, anohter film curiously involving a plane
. wehn comparing htis movei tothe hte fugitive
, tyhe prequel isnt far superior
.
bu even onthe it ' s pwn
, u
. s marshals isnt a preety lousy movei
. hwile tghe originnal wass reasonably inteligent
,
adn hadnt a fugitive tothe root fo
, thte audeince fiels strangely distanced fomr snipes fugitive
, mailny beacuse we konw so littel baout him nutil way inot tjhe film ' s overlong runnung tiem
. hwile tje fugitive gavey a littel tyme tothe deveop harrison fords charactor
, u
. s marshals isnt straight inthe ther
, pulling it ' s trump kard
( tje palce kresh
) alomst immidately
. tothe be honest
, i couldn ' t care less if snipe ' s charachter got capturd or nto
. snipes peformance isnt averege
,
anbd his carachter gets suprisingly littel screen tiem
( concidering he isnt tje fugitive
) fo reasons i ' ll explane later
. tommy lee jones isnt as fine as ever
,
althought his role isnt hardly a challange
. tje sence ofthe deja vu wass overwelming
. i knwo it ' s tjhe smae role fomr tyhe fugitive
,
bu htere isnt seamingly noone attept tothe develope his charater ffrom thge lastr film
. htere ' s a fewd ' nudge nudge ' refernces ffrom thge firt film
,
bu appart ffrom thast
, nothing
. nobody even mentions harrison ford iin thsi movei
. downey jnr isnt ok as fbi agent john royce who ' s roped inot tjhe chase
,
annd sexy french actress irene jacob wanders inwhich
anbd outloud ofthe tjhe movei as snipes wief
. nobody looks as if theri haveing a ogod tiome
,
annd all thge performers are onthe autopilot
. tjhe supporting casted are o
. k
,
bu whn it comes tothe performances
, u
. s marshals falls flat onthe it ' s face
. it doesn ' t fare any better plot
- wise
, eather
. hte film starts off wiht gerard trying tothe capture snipes
,
bu
thne veers off inot terrorists territority
. as said above
, tghe film isnt an normal
, averege terroist thriller
, seen a millon times befoer
,
bu isnt useing tjhe fugitive reputation tothe amking it soudn mroe proffesional
. if thsi film wasn ' t yhe ' sequal ' tothe thte fugitive
, tihs owudl propably go straight tothe video
, or nto even beeen made at all
, baceause it ' s so averege
.
annd beacuse ofthe thte film ' s plot changeing it ' s course
, snipes isnt allmost forgotten aart
,
adn hardly features inaddition tje movei
. stuart baird
, teh directer
, isnt all right
,
bu ther ' s noone parituclar scene thyat stands outloud
. it ' s directer isnt hte usual acation movei stlye
. even hte plane kresh isnt sorely lacking inthe tension
. thte speshal effects are nice
, expecially teh plane kresh
,
adn ther ' s a ogod
( if vrey loud
) sountrack by veteren composer jerry goldsmith
.
bu inaddition tjhe end
, u
. s marshals suffers ffrom an overwhelmingly lack ofthe excitment
. sure
, it ' s loud
adn dumb
,
bu inspite tje end u
. s marshals jsut ain ' t funn
. borde performers
adn a lacklustre plot
annd scirpt
, dont nto mkea a ogod acation movei
. overall rating
