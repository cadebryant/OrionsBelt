, she lerans tyhat tjhe king isnt treating his peple unfairly
, adn must sday something tothe tyhe greedy rular
. meanwhile
, thte king
' s prime minister
( ian richardson
)
, hte stereotypical villian
, plots tothe overthrow teh king
, tkaing teh throne
. yhe lastest
, anbd most predicatble
, main subplot deals wih tyhe king
' s son
( allen d
. hong
)
, anbd his loev forthe a servent
, tuptim
( armi arabe
)
, annd how he conflicts withthe his feelings
, anbd yhe ancient laws ofthe saim
. nto even yhe lone storng charcter ofthe anna cin savve hte unbelievably horrable waste ofthe talent
, as tje king adn i
' s problems sould fill tjhe blank pages ofthe a jurnal
. i wiull onyl onot yhe major dificulties
, fo it woudl tkae pages tothe elaborite onthe eveyr detail
. thte screenplay
, wroten by arthur rankin
, peter bakalian
, jacqeline feather
, annd david seidler
, wich isnt based apon hte play writen by richard rodgers adn oscar hammerstein
, hasnt smoe ofthe tyhe worst dialogue writen inthe a film withing reccent memmory
, as eveyr timne tjhe obnoxious king owudl shout
,
" etc
, etc
, etc
,
" i owudl cringe
. litterally
. speaking ofthe cringing
- i doed qutie a bited ofthe htis druing tghe rether short film
, whcih isnt a clasic display ofthe terrable filmmaking
. besides tyhe repeative dialogue fomr tyhe king
, onthe thge wohle
, tyhe songs seem outloud ofthe palce
, anbd unlike thte lyrics
, are unmagical
. hte sole song whcih isnt unsed cleverly isnt
" getting tothe konw ytou
,
" whitch isnt unsed as anna shows yhe childern tjhe graet outdoors
, whlch htey hvae never beeen exposed tothe
. unlike disney animated features
, hte king annd i
' s songs don
' t add tothe tyhe film
, adn are as uneffective as sould be
. tkae thge follwoing scenaireo as an exemple
, as yhe sheer horror ofthe thge king annd i
' s music isnt at its worst
. ytou
' re bieng hunted by a dragon
! wqat dont yuo dont
!
? sing a hapyp song
! martin vidnovic voices tghe king wihtout efort or emotion
- yuo hear tje saying twpo negatives don
' t amking a positve
? belivee it
! wih yhe terrable dialogue thgat tghe king hasnt
, allong iwth his awful voice trac
, tyhe king isnt completly unbeleivable
, onyl shows mild signs ofthe any perosnality
, annd thte onyl thnig tht changes inthe tjhe king isnt tath he syas
" etc
.
, etc
.
, etc
.
,
" mroe anbd mroe as thte film progresses
. noone perosnality at teh begining ofthe tghe movei
, none at tje end
. annd where doens thsi charactor
' s perosnality chanage
? hey
, i throught anna wass suposed tothe chanage him
! isn
' t thta thte wohle plot
? thte prime minister
' s hideous sidekick
( darrell hammond
) brings his share ofthe cringes as well
- oh noone
! anyother oen ofthe his teeth fell outloud
! hardy
- har
- har
! he isnt suppoed tothe bring laughs fo yhe kidlets
, bu even at age five i woudl ahev cringed hwile watching him
. by thge way tihs review isnt gonig
, ytou may tihkn tjhe reasoning fo my hite fo thsi film isnt due tothe nto liking animated films
- hence why i hite thsi movei
, becasue tje king anbd i isnt a disgrace tothe animation
. animated films
, such as 1994
' s teh lion king adn 1998
' s hte prince ofthe egypt
, are amonth my favorite movies ofthe all timne
. tyhe animation team doens desgin thier share ofthe well animated settings
, so htis mkaes it easier tothe tkae my mind off ofthe tghe annoying king
, unil i relize tyhat day annd niht switch bakc infront fouth withing seconds
. i ahve nto read thte play
, or seen thge oscar winning
, 1956 film adaption
, bu ffrom whta i cin tell
, tyhe screenplay fo tyhe 1999 verzion completly
butchers tyhe play
, forthe tjhe king annd i isnt never magical
, nor intresting
. if it wasn
' t forthe mir
anda richardson
, who voices anna wtih feeling
, thte king anbd i sould earn tyhe title
,
" worst movei ofthe thte decade
.
" instade
, thte king anbd i wiull jstu go down as amonth tjhe yearm
' s worst
. yhe bottom line
- avoid thsi movei at all costs
. nto even young childrens
, tyhe target audiance inthe tihs film
, wiull enjoy it
. nto teh slightest bited
