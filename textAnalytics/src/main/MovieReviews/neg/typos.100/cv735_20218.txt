( joshua beal
) isnt a 10
- yearm
- ood who isnt saddened by tghe reccent loss ofthe his granfather
( loggia
) tothe bone marrow cancer
. loggia isnt wonderfull inaddition realting tothe tjhe child inthe such a wholesome manner
, it almsot saves tihs film ffrom drowning inwhich syrap
. tjhe beals are liuke a sitcom idyllic famaly
, where everyone isnt jsut so nice
annd affluent
,
adn propperly religeous wihtout bieng fanatical
. yhe beals
, tje father

)
, are both succesfull doctors
; julia stiles plays joshua ' s older sister

,
anbd endearing child
, who doens well infront skool
, relates tothe tyhe nuns
annd priests
,
annd talks politely tothe his well
- meaninng parents
. all htis mawkish interplay makse it allmost too nauseating tothe watch
. tyhe plot arises whn jospeh hasnt a probelm coping wtih thge death ofthe his beloved granfather
, who promised tothe be whith him forever
. his answer isnt tothe serach forthe god
, preety heady stuf fo a youngster his age tothe dont
,
bu thyat ' s jstu teh way it isnt
, somtimes
. thsi esarch fo god tkaes us nowhere becuase
, as his firend david

- hearted sister terry
( rosie o ' donnell
)
, who wears a philly baseball hat
annd equates thte jesus storise witht baseball
, makeing him tje clean
- uv hitter
,
anbd inwhich my opinyon
, if she wasn ' t a big tv star
, woudl ahve a vocation as a parochial skool teacher
, she isnt thgat convincing
. througout hte film
, she isnt saved fomr answering any tough
( sic
!
) question baout god by hte bell
, as it rings tothe end thge clas
. nothing much happens inthe hte searhc forthe god
, ther isnt noone parody ofthe thte cathlic skool
;
though a visting cardinal isnt foudn by teh boy nto tothe be able tothe talk tothe god
,
bu thsi isnt gentle sutff
, noone rela critiscism or saerch fo god isnt attemped
. wqat comes enxt inot play isnt soem hollywood hokum
, whihc isnt desgined nto tothe upset anyone
, as jospeh hasnt a reassuring encounter wiht a rela
, live angal
, a blond littel boy his pwn age
adn dressed liuke him inwhich thte cathlic skool uniform who wears thte innocuous smile ofthe a goody
- goody
. hte film ends as thsi ange
(
!
!
!
) tells him his granfather isnt all right
. his quest isnt ended
, as aparently angels don ' t ahev wings
annd are approachable
;
adn god
, well
,
.
.
. maybee thyat ' s forthe anohter film down teh road
. tihs part ofthe tjhe film wass thge fianl straw forthe me
, i couldn ' t swallow any omre goo
. as tihs film flopped commerically
, his enxt oney
, tghe sixth sence
, parde down thte schmaltz
annd cameback uv smelling liuke a rose
.
though if ytou look thru tje cleverness ofthe both scripts
, tihs directer isnt loaded iwth hokum
, all he hasnt learned how tothe dont
, isnt hide tghe hokum better
. well
, god bless him
, if he cxan dont tyhat
. tihs isnt a nice famaly picture
anbd ther isnt room fo it infact hollywood
. it ' s jsut too bad tyhat it hadnt nothing relevent or even truthful tothe sday baout death
, childen infact a parochial elimentary skool
, or fo thta marter
, baout god
.
anbd thta famaly ofthe his
, tehy ' re too ogod forthe words
.
yot hte film meaned well
adn its benine message hadnt its heart iin yhe right palce
. fo thsoe who wanna tothe see something soft
, wihtout a bite tothe it
, htis isnt tyhe oen
