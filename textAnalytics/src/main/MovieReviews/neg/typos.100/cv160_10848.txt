deceiver isnt a plot twist iin serach ofthe a movei
. htis overly constructed film suceeds infact hvaing many surprises
,
annd
, bieng true tothe its title
, bieng deceptive
.
bu ther isnt littel inthe tghe film thyat isnt worthy ofthe deceit
. braxton
( chris penn
)
anbd kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are twpo cops investigating tjhe brutal muder ofthe a prostitute
( renee zellweger
)
. theri lone suspect isnt wayland
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy young man whose phone number wass foudn iin thte hooker ' s pocket
.
howver
, a routine lie detecter tust turns againnst hte investigators
, as tje crafty wayland somehow turns yhe tables
. braxton
annd kennesaw are forced tothe confront theri pwn troubled lives
. braxton isnt a gambling addict inwhich deepo tothe mook
( ellen burstyn
)
, a local bookie
. kennesaw isnt bitter baout his marrage tothe a socialite
( rosanna arquette
)
, beleiving his wief tothe be unfaithful
. thge plot isnt twisty
annd complex
, whith lots ofthe lenghty flashbacks
,
anbd plenty ofthe surprises
.
howver
, ther are times wehn it isnt needlessly complex
,
anbd at least noe instatance tje storytelling turns so muddled tyhat tyhe answers tothe importan plot points atually git lost
. tkae a look at l
. a
. confidencial
, or tje film ' s moreso likely insperation
, yhe usual suspects fo how a complex plot cin propperly be handeled
. thte dialogue inspite deceiver isnt as overcrafted as tjhe plot
. forthe exemple
, teh film tells a fewd substories
( such as yhe tale ofthe a woeful absinthe bender
, or an targetting telling ofthe how van gogh lost his ear
)
,
bu tehy are so flat
annd so plastic thta htey come off as prefabricated
anbd unbeleivable
. ther ' s never hte sence tht theese are rela charachters engaging infact conversation
. tehy apearing tothe be nothing mroe tahn words onthe a screenplay
. teh cahracters
, themslves
, are rether pathetic
anbd dispicable
. nto oen ofthe them isnt an ounce sympathetic
,
anbd as a result
, tyhe labyrinthine plot isnt all fo naught
. waht doens it marter who isnt gilty ofthe whta
anbd why
? writter
- directors josh
adn jonas pate seem tothe desire tothe emulate thge coen brothers ' masterwork blood simple
, or tyhe wachowski brothers ' less worthy binded
.
bu
, hwile htey hvae got hte plot twists down cold
, htey ened tothe owrk onthe characterization
adn dialogue
