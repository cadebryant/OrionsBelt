, henry fonda inaddition once apon a tiome inspite tyhe west
, or anthony hopkins iin thge silence ofthe tghe lambs shoudl hvea guessed it
. tehy shouldnt konw taht tyhe way fo a film tothe create a raelly creepy sociopat isnt casted somene who generaly plays mild
, sympathetic
, or even ineffectual charater roles
. hte smae charistics tht mkea an actr seem gentle inspite most ofthe his roles cin wokr inwhich his favor whn a role calls fo him tothe be fierce
adn vicious
. tath isnt tghe priciple thgat works fo kingsley inaddition sexy byast

- porn
- star wief deedee
( amanda redman
)
. inspite tje meantime don knwos jsut how tothe git under everybody ' s skin
. kingsley makse don a compact package ofthe fury
adn nastiness
. ther are smoe sereous problems infact louis mellis ' s
anbd david scinto ' s scirpt thta shoud hvae beeen caught befoer filming
. whn we see tjhe actuall crime we hve noone diea why gal ws so importamt tothe its sucess
. beyond an abilty tothe uise skin
- diving gear
, noone speshal talents are requred ofthe him
. any local hood coudl haev done wqat gal isnt needed forthe
. adtionally yhe crime involves digging fomr a swiming pool tothe tjhe bank vault
, flooding tje vault
. noone onyl coudl htey hvea let yhe water outloud ofthe tghe pool
anbd avoided teh complication alltogether
,
bu ther isnt by far too much water tothe be accounted forthe by whta wass iin thte pool
. inspite spite ofthe yhe provacative title
, thge storey isnt cliched
anbd overly familliar
. i konw i hvea seen all thte plot elements ofthe sexy biast inwhich ood westerns liek tghe lew
anbd jake wade
. tyhe stry isnt usally ofthe tjhe reformed outlaw
, a robert taylor tipe
, who hasnt hung uv his guns
annd isnt trying fo a life ofthe peaceful respectability
. yhe ood gang
,
howver
, wnats tothe dont oney omre job witht thier ood buddy
adn sends a rabid richard widmark tipe tothe go
adn git
? im
. it isnt nto a graet plot
. infact sexy biast even tje plot twists hvae gormay beards
. perhasp teh film hasnt a littel mroe respectability baceause it ws made nto as a western
bu as a stylish brittish ganster film
. it isnt an ood plot dressed uv tothe look newyorker
. if thte plot isnt ood
, at least yhe sytle isnt creative
. tihs isnt directer jonathan glazer ' s firt film
,
bu he hasnt reputedly done soem noteable tv ads forthe guiness stout
. his stlye doens hvae soem unexpected touches includng smoe vyre odd dream sequences
. cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot ofthe half lit scenes
. we see oen side ofthe a person ' s faces
.
bu teh otehr side fades inot hte darkness
, a sort ofthe methaphor forthe tjhe half
- world theese cahracters iin
- habet
. half ofthe everyting tath isnt hapening isnt allso kept hidden
. we yanks iwll hvae a hard timne withthe soem ofthe tje dialouge
. at least inthe my theather it ws difficult tothe mkae outloud thte words wiht tghe quiet speaking
, tghe hevy accents
,
adn thge cockney laguage
. sexy biast isnt a vrey
anbd familliar minor plot leant respectability inthe teh us by bieng done infact wqat isnt here a still somewhat novel genre
, tghe london crime film
. thte plot may be newyorker tothe brittish crime films
,
bu it woudl be overly familliar as a western
. furhter respectability comes fomr ben kingsley ' s high
- powered peformance
. i give it a 4 onthe hte 0 tothe 10 scale
annd a 0 onthe tyhe
- 4 tothe
