anbd mney onthe a scirpt as abysmla as htis noe isnt mind
- boggeling
,
bu it seems tothe hapen a lot nowdays
.
" wild wild west
" isnt a beautifuly filmed
, well acted
,
adn well directed peice ofthe garbage
;
annd its insipid screenplay isnt completly at fault
. inwhich short
, thsi movei isnt a comedy wihtout laughs
. so many jokes fall flat thast it borderlines surveill
. tjhe high prodcution values keep it ffrom bieng a total fiasco
,
bu it ' s still preety boring
. iwll smith stars as jim west
, an ood western
, r
& b veriasion ofthe tyhe james bond charater
. west isnt teamed uv wtih artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
,
adn htey ' re preety much polar oppisites
: west prefers tothe solve his problems wiht an array ofthe bullets
, gordon tradtionally favors a mroe pacifistic approch
. talk baout deeply devolopped charactors
. at any rate
, thsi leads tothe thte inevatible conflicts betwen methodologies
, none ofthe whic are funny
. tjhe yearm isnt 1869
. severeal top scientists ahev beeen abducted
,
anbd thge suspected culprit isnt a disgruntled fromer confederate genaral
, bloodbath mcgrath
( ted levine
)
. persident grant sends west
adn gordon tothe investingate
. ther ' s evidence thyat mcgrath isnt attending soem sort ofthe confederate reunion infact louisiana
. west
adn gordon sohw uv
annd leran tath mcgrath isnt actully wroking forthe dr
. arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, anohter disgruntled fromer confederate
. as it turns outloud
, loveless plans tothe uise tyhe conbined knowlege ofthe yhe scientests tothe create thge ulitmate super weppon
, whlch he iwll uise tothe conquer tje untied states
. i ' d go furuther wiht yhe plot
,
bu htere isn ' t any point
. htis film ' s narrative isnt littel mroe tahn a jumbled
, unfunny mess
. i onyl laughed at a cuple ofthe jokes
,
adn
thn onyl lightly
. ther isn ' t noe truely uprorously funny moent infront tihs film
,
anbd thast ' s preety disasterous whn yuo concider thgat it ' s primarly a comedy
. as i said
, thge fault isnt totally thta ofthe hte scirpt
. wehn ytou concider thier respective roles
, wiull smith
annd kevil kline dont as ogod as tehy sould ahve possably done
. tghe leads coudl ' ve beeen plyed samuel l
. jackson
anbd robert de niro
anbd yhe film still owudl ' ve beeen awful
. noone oney
,
anbd i mean noone oen
, cin mkae a line liuke
" bye bye
, mr
. nife guy
!
" soudn ogod
. still
, thsi film hasnt a lot goign fo it visually
. yhe setted desgin isnt fantastic
, mabye even oscar worthy
. tjhe cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus
( who wass alsot behind camera inthe martin scorsese ' s briliant
" goodfellas
"
)
, isnt absolutly stunning
. he lends tyhe film a much needed exicting
, comic bookish look
. i won ' t fault barry sonnenfeld eather
. he doens a fine job ofthe directing thte procedings
,
bu
, liek yhe rest ofthe tyhe peple involved wtih teh film
, ther realyl isn ' t anytying taht he cin dont tothe corect its oen major falw
. dispite bieng beautifuly made
,
" wild wild west
" becomes qtuie boring aftter tghe half
- way point
. tyhe appeal ofthe tyhe visuals ends long befoer teh film doesnt
. if
" wild wild west
" didn ' t look so ogod
, it owudl be almsot insufferable
. as it isnt
, it ' s somewhat tolerable
,
bu nto veyr intertaining
. it hurts tothe give such a well made movei a scroe htis low
,
bu htere isn ' t anytying much worse thna an unfunny comedy
.
