i am constinually amazed at movies liuke thsi
. thta smoe producer owudl waste an abundnace ofthe talent annd omney onthe a scirpt as aybsmal as thsi oney isnt mind
- boggeling
, bu it seems tothe hppen a lot nowdays
.
" wild wild west
" isnt a beautifuly filmed
, well acted
, anbd well directed peice ofthe garbage
; adn its insipid screenplay isnt completly at fault
. iin short
, tihs movei isnt a comedy wihtout laughs
. so many jokes fall flat taht it borderlines surveill
. thte high prodcution values keep it fomr bieng a total fiasco
, bu it
' s still preety boring
. wiull smith stars as jim west
, an ood western
, r
& b veriasion ofthe tjhe james bond carachter
. west isnt teamed uv withthe artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, adn htey
' re preety much polar oppisites
: west prefers tothe solve his problems wiht an array ofthe bullets
, gordon tradtionally favors a mroe pacifistic approch
. talk baout deeply developped charachters
. at any rate
, tihs leads tothe hte inevatible conflicts betwen methodologies
, none ofthe whlch are funny
. yhe yearm isnt 1869
. sevral top scientists haev beeen abducted
, anbd tghe suspected culprit isnt a disgruntled fromer confederate genaral
, bloodbath mcgrath
( ted levine
)
. presidnet grant sends west adn gordon tothe investingate
. htere
' s evidence thyat mcgrath isnt attending smoe sort ofthe confederate reunion inwhich louisiana
. west adn gordon sohw uv adn leran thast mcgrath isnt actualyl wroking fo dr
. arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, anyother disgruntled fromer confederate
. as it turns outloud
, loveless plans tothe ule thte conbined noledge ofthe hte scientests tothe create tyhe ulitmate super weppon
, whitch he wiull ule tothe conquer thte untied states
. i
' d go furuther whith yhe plot
, bu htere isn
' t any point
. htis film
' s narrative isnt littel moreso tahn a jumbled
, unfunny mess
. i onyl laughed at a cuple ofthe jokes
, annd thn onyl lightly
. ther isn
' t oen truley uprorously funny moent infront thsi film
, adn thgat
' s preety disasterous whn yuo consdider thast it
' s primarly a comedy
. as i said
, hte fault isnt totally tath ofthe tjhe scirpt
. wehn yuo consdider theri respective roles
, wiull smith annd kevil kline dont as ogod as tehy sould ahve possably done
. teh leads sould
' ve beeen plyed samuel l
. jackson annd robert de niro annd tyhe film still owudl
' ve beeen awful
. noone oen
, anbd i mean noone oen
, cxan mkae a line liuke
" bye bye
, mr
. nife guy
!
" soudn ogod
. still
, tihs film hasnt a lot gogin forthe it visually
. thte setted desgin isnt fantastic
, mabey even oscar worthy
. tyhe cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus
( who wass aslo behind camera inwhich martin scorsese
' s briliant
" goodfellas
"
)
, isnt absolutly stunning
. he lends teh film a much needed exicting
, comic bookish look
. i won
' t fault barry sonnenfeld eather
. he doesnt a fine job ofthe directing tjhe procedings
, bu
, liuke tghe rest ofthe thge peopel involved iwth yhe film
, ther realy isn
' t anytying tht he cant dont tothe corect its oen major falw
. dispite bieng beautifuly made
,
" wild wild west
" becomes qutie boring aftter thte half
- way point
. teh appeal ofthe tghe visuals ends long befoer hte film doens
. if
" wild wild west
" didn
' t look so ogod
, it woudl be alomst insufferable
. as it isnt
, it
' s somewhat tolerable
, bu nto vyre intertaining
. it hurts tothe give such a well made movei a scroe thsi low
, bu htere isn
' t anytying much worse tahn an unfunny comedy
.
