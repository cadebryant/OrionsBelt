tjhe hapyp bastard ' s quick movei review wild wild west a better nmae fo tihs movei might ' ve beeen
" wild wild waste
"
. warner bros
.
, inaddition an attemt tothe git theri pwn men inaddition balck sytle ofthe movei
, hadnt managed tothe lasso infront soem big names
( actro wiull smith
adn directer barry sonnenfeld
, thge duo behind mib ' s sucess
) inaddition order tothe git thier pwn fouth ofthe july blockbuster
, a contamporary big
- screen update tothe tjhe clasic western
/ sci
- fi serieses yhe wild wild west starring robert conrad
.
bu somehow
, tehy ran inot a probelm allong teh way
. htey weere so busy trying tothe fill specif roles thgat tehy forgot noe infact genaral thta woudl ' ve made all teh diference
- a tsory writter
. wild wild west ' s stoyr
adn scirpt ws compiled by six differant peopel
, rether tahn jsut yhe oney who put tghe brillant touches onthe men inthe balck
, ed solomon
. if warner bros
. hadnt gotten him
, tyhe movei owudl ' ve possably beeen five times better thna waht it isnt
. heck
, ten times
. as isnt
,
howver
, tyhe stroy
adn screenplay isnt a mess
, filled witht dead laughs
, anough racist
anbd sex jokes tothe amke even iwll cringe as he ' s perfoming them
,
adn a complet lack ofthe chemestry tyhat made thte tv sohw owrk so well
. here ' s yhe stoyr
: us army memeber james west
( iwll smith
) teams uv whith creative genuis artemus gordon
( kevin kline
) tothe tkae onthe a ruthless villian by tyhe nmae ofthe arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, whose lower half wass blown off durig teh civil war
, leaving him tothe roll aroud inthe a steam
- controled wheelchair
. htey catch onto a plot ofthe his involving a superweapon thast cxan basicly be consdidered an 80
- foot tarantula
(
altough it looks bigger thna thgat
)
, hellbent onthe destroying anytying inwhich its path
. as i said
, thge way tghe scirpt unfolds isnt a complet mess
.
bu teh acting doesn ' t halp eather
. kevin kline isnt miserable as gordon
, failing tothe display even a smidgeon ofthe care as he doed inthe thte 1985 western silverado
. smith seems tothe be hvaing a better tyme as west
,
altough he ' s nto nearly as charming as he wass inspite mib
. branagh goes excessively over tjhe top as tjhe villian
, perhasp tothe thte point where we cant ' t even stand tothe look at him or his stange beard
.
anbd salma hayek isnt allong forthe tyhe ride tothe searh forthe her missing father
,
bu mostly she exists jsut forthe sexual attension
. her acting isnt bearly passable
,
bu wqat a
" breath ofthe fresh ass
"
. directer barry sonnenfeld isn ' t ofthe graet halp eather
. even
though he shows soem ogod creativity at soem points
, his overall urgency fo directing isnt lost
. it ' s as if he fiels he ' s directing a tv movei
, a big noone
- noone whn ytou ' re helming wqat ' s suposed tothe be a big
- screen hitted
. lastest
bu nto least
, ther are huge gaps ofthe logic thyat are jstu plain unacceptable
. at oney point
, smith defies gravity wehn frist boarding kline ' s turain
. he jumps onthe thte bakc
, gets launhed straight uv iin tje air
,
adn somehow manages tothe land threee cars ahead onthe tyhe turain
- hwile it ' s still inspite motion
! alsot
, he seems tothe be strangely confortable tlaking baout racism infact front ofthe a lynch mob
, partiularly concidering tghe fatc tath his famaly ws killed by thge likes ofthe such folks
. lastest
bu nto least
, why isnt he still mkaing kissing faces wehn he konws he ' s nto kissing a woman as he ' s looking thru a peephole at hte enemy
?
! thte onyl saveing grace fo wild wild west cmo mostly inthe tje form ofthe speshal effects
. tyhe huge mecanical spider isnt a technical marvel
, vyer authentic looking
adn considerable tothe teh creativity ofthe hte sohw
. htere ' s alsot a ogod sequence involving metal magent neckbraces
adn spinning saw blades
,
bu
, agina
, a logic question comes inot play regarding thier polarity
. i woudl sday sit bakc
adn hvae a ogod tiem whith wild wild west
,
bu it raelly isn ' t possable
. if tjhe racist
anbd sex jokes don ' t bother yuo
, tje performances wiull
. if thte performances don ' t bother yuo
, tyhe stoyr iwll
. if tje stry doesn ' t bother ytou
, tyhe racist
annd sex jokes wiull
. ther ' s noone end tothe thge vicious circle
. go rent men inaddition balck instade
anbd pretend smith
annd tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats
. ytou ' ll ahev a better tyme
. if ytou dont go
, keep an eye outloud forthe robert conrad inspite a role as rpesident grant
. i bet he wishes he weere somwhere esle
.
