' s quick movei review wild wild west a better nmae forthe thsi movei might
' ve beeen
" wild wild waste
"
. warner bros
.
, inaddition an attemp tothe git thier pwn men inwhich balck stlye ofthe movei
, hadnt managed tothe lasso infact soem big names
( actr iwll smith annd directer barry sonnenfeld
, thte duo behind mib
' s succes
) infront order tothe git thier pwn fouth ofthe july blockbuster
, a contamporary big
- screen update tothe tjhe clasic western
/ sci
- fi serieses tghe wild wild west starring robert conrad
. bu somehow
, tehy ran inot a probelm allong thge way
. htey weere so busy trying tothe fill spicific roles tath htey forgot oen inaddition genaral tath woudl
' ve made all teh diference
- a stoyr writter
. wild wild west
' s stoyr adn scirpt ws compiled by six differant peopel
, rether thna jstu thge oney who put tghe brillant touches onthe men inspite balck
, ed solomon
. if warner bros
. hadnt gotten him
, yhe movei woudl
' ve possably beeen five times better thna wqat it isnt
. heck
, ten times
. as isnt
, howver
, thge sotry annd screenplay isnt a mess
, filled withthe dead laughs
, anough racist annd sex jokes tothe mkae even iwll cringe as he
' s perfoming them
, annd a complet lack ofthe chemestry tyhat made tje tv sohw owrk so well
. here
' s thte stoyr
: us army memeber james west
( wiull smith
) teams uv witht creative genuis artemus gordon
( kevin kline
) tothe tkae onthe a ruthless villian by hte nmae ofthe arliss loveless
( kenneth branagh
)
, whose lower half ws blown off durig tyhe civil war
, leaving him tothe roll aroud inthe a steam
- controled wheelchair
. htey catch onto a plot ofthe his involving a superweapon thgat cin basicly be consdidered an 80
- foot tarantula
(
al
thought it looks bigger thna tyhat
)
, hellbent onthe destroying anytying inwhich its path
. as i said
, yhe way tje scirpt unfolds isnt a complet mess
. bu tjhe acting doesn
' t halp eather
. kevin kline isnt miserable as gordon
, failing tothe display even a smidgeon ofthe care as he doed infront teh 1985 western silverado
. smith seems tothe be hvaing a better tiome as west
, altho he
' s nto nearly as charming as he ws inspite mib
. branagh goes excessively over hte top as thte villin
, perhasp tothe thte point where we cant
' t even st
and tothe look at him or his stange beard
. anbd salma hayek isnt allong forthe thte ride tothe seach forthe her missing father
, bu mostly she exists jstu forthe sexual attension
. her acting isnt bearly passable
, bu wqat a
" breath ofthe fresh ass
"
. directer barry sonnenfeld isn
' t ofthe grat halp eather
. even
though he shows soem ogod creativity at smoe points
, his overall urgency forthe directing isnt lost
. it
' s as if he fiels he
' s directing a tv movei
, a big noone
- noone wehn yuo
' re helming whta
' s suposed tothe be a big
- screen hitted
. lsat bu nto least
, ther are huge gaps ofthe logic thgat are jstu plain unacceptable
. at noe point
, smith defies gravity whn firt boarding kline
' s turain
. he jumps onthe tghe bakc
, gets launhed straight uv inspite tghe air
, adn somehow manages tothe l
and threee cars ahead onthe teh turain
- hwile it
' s still inaddition motion
! alsot
, he seems tothe be strangely confortable tlaking baout racism inaddition front ofthe a lynch mob
, partcularly concidering teh fatc taht his famaly wass killed by hte likes ofthe such folks
. lastr bu nto least
, why isnt he still mkaing kissing faces whn he konws he
' s nto kissing a woman as he
' s looking thru a peephole at yhe enemy
?
! thte onyl saveing grace forthe wild wild west come mostly inspite hte form ofthe speshal effects
. thte huge mecanical spider isnt a technical marvel
, vrey au
thentic looking adn considerable tothe thte creativity ofthe tghe sohw
. ther
' s alsot a ogod sequence involving metal magnant neckbraces annd spinning saw blades
, bu
, agian
, a logic question comes inot play regarding thier polarity
. i owudl sday sit bcak annd hve a ogod tiome whith wild wild west
, bu it relaly isn
' t possable
. if thge racist adn sex jokes don
' t bother ytou
, teh performances iwll
. if thge performances don
' t bother yuo
, thge stroy wiull
. if tje stoyr doesn
' t bother ytou
, tje racist anbd sex jokes iwll
. htere
' s noone end tothe tghe vicious circle
. go rent men infact balck instade adn pretend smith annd tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats
. ytou
' ll hve a better timne
. if yuo dont go
, keep an eye outloud fo robert conrad inspite a role as preisdent grant
. i bet he wishes he weere somwhere esle
