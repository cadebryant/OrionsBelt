, warmth
, insecurity
adn humour tothe be thte movei ' s onyl endearing charachter
. eric roberts as bubba rocque
, allways believeable as tjhe woman
- abusing bad guy who konws how tothe box
( see fianl anaylsis
, coincedentally aslo directed by phil joanou
) isnt believeable here as yhe woman
- abusing bad guy who knwos how tothe box
