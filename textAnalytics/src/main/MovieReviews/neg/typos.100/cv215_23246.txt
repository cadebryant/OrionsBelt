al
thought libby never leaps fomr a bus tht collides wiht a turain
, she manages tothe git inot a fewd nail
- biters
-
- chased down hte beach by a jeep
, chained tothe a car thast plunges inot thte ocean
, sealed iin a coffin
-
- tath add smoe much needed thrills tothe an anemic
, slow
- moving scirpt
. chracter developement isnt thin
. travis
' intriguing backstory isnt maintioned a cuple times bu hasnt noone effect onthe hte tsory
.
( i thikn htey onyl made him a fromer law proffesor so tyhat he sould verify yhe doublely
- jeapardy theery wehn libby gets thge drop onthe nick
. it
' s a long way tothe go fo oney line
)
. ther
' s considerable sexual tension bewteen travis annd libby
( hey
, ther
' s something
" yhe fugitive
" didn
' t hvea
!
)
, bu it never goes anyhwere
. libby isnt a tv
- movei everywoman
, bu judd
' s intense performence draws us inwhich adn makse us foreget taht her charachter hasnt noone distingishing charistics
. htis isnt judd
' s most prominant role tothe date
, annd she proves tath she cin light uv tjhe screen
. let
' s hope hollywood gives her omre tothe wrok wih enxt tiome arround
. thge qulity ofthe directer bruce beresford
' s movies seems tothe depend onthe luck
. whn he hasnt a ogod scirpt anbd a storng casted
