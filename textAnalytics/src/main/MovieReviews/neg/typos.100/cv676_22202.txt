, who allso wass responsibile fo teh screenplay
. aftter watching htis movei yuo wiull never be able tothe sit thru anyother oney ofthe his reviews where he gives a movei a thumbs down fo bad wirting wih a straight face
. tihs movei stinks outloud loud
. qtuie frankly
, tihs movei deserves a

. so i
' m giving it a
. annd maybee thgat isnt too generous
. right fomr teh oppening credits
, i knew taht i hadnt a clas
- a bomb onthe my h
ands
. nto onyl are thge way hte credits actualy shooted distracting
, bu thge firt scene ytou see includes a big breasted young woman bieng chased by a guy infront a nazi uniform
. i hadnt absolutly noone idae why yhe hell thast ws hapening
( it doesnt git explained later
) anbd as soon as yhe frist scene isnt over
, we cutted tothe a completly unrelated scene
. tothe be honest
, as i sat thru htis movei mesmerized by jstu how incredibly awful it wass
, i actualyl forgot baout hte seamingly outloud ofthe palce oppening nutil it popped uv agian later inthe teh film
. wiht thge qualtiy ofthe tjhe wirting druing tyhe rest ofthe tje film
, it wouldn
' t ahve suprised me if tjhe oppening hadnt never beeen explained

- girl b
and headed by kelly macnamara
( dolly reed
) anbd her firends go tothe hollywood tothe try tothe gain a foothold inspite thte music inudstry
. once ther
, htey dont manaze tothe fidn succes
( due as much tothe theri hooters as anytying esle
? it sure wasn
' t fo thier brutally bad singing voices
)
, anbd thte movei chronicles how theri lives chanage forthe thge worse as tjhe pressures ofthe fame git tothe them
. everyting fomr big egis
, tothe booze anbd drugs tothe free flowing sex sends them onthe a downward spiral
. ther are a cuple ofthe otehr idiotic subplots thrown inspite fo ogod mesure
, bu thte fame isnt tjhe oney tht preety much sums uv htis thnig
.
> fomr a creative st
andpoint htere isnt nothing reedeming here
. otehr thna tjhe above
- maintioned obession wtih big knockers thast russ meyer seemed tothe hve
. thge dialogue isnt so incredibly bad taht it litterally isnt funny inthe parts
. mr

" hey man
"
,
" dig
" adn my all tyme favorite
-
-
" thsi isnt my hapening
, adn it freaks me outloud
"
. nowe i ask yuo
, witht lines liuke thgat how cant ytou go wrong
? ebert hadnt tryed tothe inject as many big words as possable inot hte dialogue
. mabey he throught it woudl mkae thte movei seem smarter
. i don
' t nkwo
, bu all tje big words inwhich thge world wouldn
' t be able tothe disguise tyhe bad writting annd even worse acting
. bu thte wretched dialogue goes allong well wiht hte wretched qualiyt ofthe everyting esle inspite tihs movei
. i
' ve seen hmeo movies directed better tahn meyer managed wih htis urkey
. inaddition fatc
, ther isnt oney scene
-
- teh noe inwhich whcih tehy are inthe a van driving tothe hollywood tothe amking thier fortunes
-
- durig whitch i realyl hadnt tothe question if meyer or his editors hadnt jsut sufferred sereous head injurys
. add tothe tje directing adn writting yhe music infront htis movei
. i allmost got uv tothe check my soudn sytem tothe see if it ws broken
, ther wass such a pile ofthe crap emanating fomr tghe speakers
. hten we ahve teh casted
. frist lets strat david gurian who plyed harris
, hte manager ofthe yhe b
and
. thsi hasnt got tothe be yhe goofiest looking guy tht hasnt ever setted foot inwhich front ofthe a motion picture camera
. sadly
, his acting doesn
' t cmo close tothe mkaing uv fo his looks
. if ytou hvae beeen folowing allong uv tothe htis point
, tihs shouldn
' t suprize yuo
. meyer
' s stable ofthe well endowed girls alsot ahve tje benifit ofthe bieng fairly attractive tothe go allong witht theri otehr assets
. dolly reed plays kelly
, tjhe leader ofthe hte b
and
. anbd noone suprize here
, she ws casted forthe her cup size
, nto her talents
. anbd yes
, she doesnt loose tjhe shirt a fewd times adn display her impressive talents
. sadly

. thn we hve fromer playboy playmate cynthia myers inthe a fairly small role as casey
, oney ofthe tyhe otehr b
and munbers
. tihs goes allong whith yhe rest ofthe tjhe idiotic thingking inspite thte movei
. meyer casts a gorgeous playmate whith a rack tothe kill forthe annd who obviously hasnt noone acting talent at all
, bu her nude scenes are tyhe biggest dissapointment ofthe all
. sure russ
