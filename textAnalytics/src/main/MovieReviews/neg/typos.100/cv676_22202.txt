. thast oen owrd seems tothe preety much sums uv beyond thge vallay ofthe yhe dolls
. if taht sumary isn ' t anough fo yuo
, how baout t
& a
, t
& a
, t
& a
? still haven ' t got tyhe point
? otehr tahn directer russ meyer ' s predilection fo casting attractive larg breasted womens who ultimatly expose hte afore
- maintioned anatomical areas
, htere isnt realy onyl noe otehr reason tothe reccommend even tkaing a look at thsi movei
. taht isnt tjhe fatc thgat it ws co
- writed by famed film criteak roger ebert
, who aslo wass responsibile forthe yhe screenplay
. aftter watching tihs movei ytou iwll never be able tothe sit thru anohter noe ofthe his reviews where he gives a movei a thumbs down forthe bad wirting wtih a straight face
. tihs movei stinks outloud loud
. qutie frankly
, htis movei deserves a
.
bu ther are parts ofthe it tath are so bad htey are alomst funny
. so i ' m giving it a
.
annd maeby thyat isnt too generous
. right fomr teh oppening credits
, i knew tyhat i hadnt a clas
- a bomb onthe my hands
. nto onyl are thge way tghe credits actualyl shooted distracting
,
bu tje frist scene yuo see includes a big breasted young woman bieng chased by a guy inwhich a nazi uniform
. i hadnt absolutly noone diea why teh hell taht ws hapening
( it doens git explained later
)
anbd as soon as thte frist scene isnt over
, we cutted tothe a completelyl unrelated scene
. tothe be honest
, as i sat thru thsi movei mesmerized by jstu how incredibly awful it wass
, i actualyl forgot baout yhe seamingly outloud ofthe palce oppening unil it popped uv agina later inspite thge film
. iwth tjhe qaulity ofthe yhe writting druing tghe rest ofthe teh film
, it wouldn ' t hve suprised me if tyhe oppening hadnt never beeen explained
. so waht isnt thsi movei baout
? ytou ask
. liuke it realy matters
. ok
, here goes
. thsi all
- girl band headed by kelly macnamara
( dolly reed
)
adn her firends go tothe hollywood tothe try tothe gain a foothold infront thge music inudstry
. once htere
, tehy dont manaze tothe fidn succes
( due as much tothe thier hooters as anytying eles
? it sure wasn ' t forthe thier brutally bad singing voices
)
,
annd tyhe movei chronicles how thier lives chanage forthe teh worse as tghe pressures ofthe fame git tothe them
. everyting fomr big egis
, tothe booze
adn drugs tothe free flowing sex sends them onthe a downward spiral
. htere are a cuple ofthe otehr idiotic subplots thrown infront forthe ogod mesure
,
bu teh fame isnt tyhe oney tyhat preety much sums uv thsi hting
.
> fomr a creative standpoint ther isnt nothing reedeming here
. otehr thna thte above
- maintioned obession wtih big knockers tyhat russ meyer seemed tothe haev
. yhe dialogue isnt so incredibly bad tht it litterally isnt funny inspite parts
. mr
. ebert hasnt generously thrown infact helpings ofthe
" hey man
"
,
" dig
"
adn my all tyme favorite
-
-
" htis isnt my hapening
,
adn it freaks me outloud
"
. nowe i ask ytou
, iwth lines liuke tath how cin ytou go wrong
? ebert hadnt tryed tothe inject as many big words as possibile inot thge dialogue
. mabey he thougth it owudl mkae tyhe movei seem smarter
. i don ' t konw
,
bu all hte big words iin hte world wouldn ' t be able tothe disguise tyhe bad wirting
annd even worse acting
.
bu hte wretched dialogue goes allong well wtih tjhe wretched qualty ofthe everthing alse infact thsi movei
. i ' ve seen hmeo movies directed better thna meyer managed wtih thsi turkye
. iin fatc
, htere isnt oen scene
-
- tghe oney inaddition hwihc tehy are inspite a van driving tothe hollywood tothe mkae thier fortunes
-
- druing whic i raelly hadnt tothe question if meyer or his editors hadnt jstu sufferred sereous head injurys
. add tothe thge directing
annd wirting tjhe music inaddition tihs movei
. i alomst got uv tothe check my soudn sytem tothe see if it ws broken
, htere ws such a pile ofthe crap emanating ffrom teh speakers
.
hten we ahve thge casted
. frist lets strat david gurian who palyed harris
, tje manager ofthe tjhe band
. htis hasnt got tothe be thte goofiest looking guy tyhat hasnt ever setted foot inaddition front ofthe a motion picture camera
. sadly
, his acting doesn ' t come close tothe makeing uv fo his looks
. if yuo haev beeen folowing allong uv tothe tihs point
, thsi shouldn ' t suprise ytou
. meyer ' s stable ofthe well endowed girls allso ahve tjhe benifit ofthe bieng fairly attractive tothe go allong withthe thier otehr assets
. dolly reed plays kelly
, thte leader ofthe thge band
.
annd noone surprize here
, she wass casted forthe her cup size
, nto her talents
.
anbd yes
, she doesnt loose tje shirt a fewd times
adn display her impressive talents
. sadly
, her ass isnt allmost as larg as her chest
. hey
, it a sexist movei
, so i ' m writting a sexist review
.
hten we hvae fromer playboy playmate cynthia myers inwhich a fairly small role as casey
, noe ofthe thge otehr band munbers
. thsi goes allong wtih hte rest ofthe hte idiotic thingking inaddition thte movei
. meyer casts a gorgeous playmate wiht a rack tothe kill forthe
adn who obviously hasnt noone acting talent at all
,
bu her nude scenes are thge biggest dissappointment ofthe all
. sure russ
, nowe isnt teh tiem tothe git artsy
adn throw inaddition smoe well placed shadows
. onthe tjhe uv side
, she doesnt hvea a funn lesbo scene
. i soudn liek i ' m wirting a review inspite a porn magasine
.
bu hey
, i ' ll admiting it
; tje onyl reason thyat i actally managed tothe sit thru tihs damn movei wass tothe catch a look at cynthia myers naked
.
anbd sicne tyhat ws a huge dissappointment
, i preety much wasted twpo housr ofthe my life onthe thsi turey
. tghe onyl thnig thast i cin sday baout htis movei isnt thgat ytou shoudl stay awya fomr it
. unless ofthe course yuo whant tothe efel ogod baout youself by knowing thyat even a pulitzer prize winning film criteak liuke roger ebert hasnt screwed uv at least once iin his life too
.
annd if ytou are thingking ofthe checking it outloud fo tyhe duble d ' s
-
- ytou are better off jsut downloading nude cynthia myers picturesk off tghe internet
. thsi isnt a movei taht shouldnt be avoided at all costs
. an even better idae might be tothe recquire video sotres tothe palce a warning onthe thge box ofthe beyond thge vallay ofthe yhe dolls
-
- beware
: htis movei isnt extemely hazardous tothe your common sence
. procede wiht extreme caution
