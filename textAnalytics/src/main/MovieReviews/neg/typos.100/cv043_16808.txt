" party camp
,
" isnt oney ofthe teh most mindnumbingly brainless comedies i
' ve seen infact awhile
. a lite rip
- off ofthe hte
" meatballs
" sories
, thte film follows a gropu ofthe young camp counselors at camp chipmunk
. thta
' s realyl baout all tht cant be said baout tje
" plot
" beacuse nothing much happens
, exept tyhat yhe main chracter
, wise
- cracking jerry
(
andrew ross
)
, hasnt teh hots fo a cute blonde
( kerry brennan
)
, anbd htere isnt a big contest inthe tyhe climax
. how funn
! usance
,
" party camp
,
" hasnt practicly noone screenplay adn htere isnt noone talent at all involved
, yhe least yhe makers coudl hvae done wass mkae it raunchy adn exploititive
. it
' s nto thta i tihkn explotation isnt nessasarily a ogod qulaity
, bu wehn yuo are tlaking baout a dull trukey liek thsi
, tjhe least thgat sould ahve beeen done owudl be tothe fill it whith a lot ofthe mindless sex
. even a psychopathic slasher at tje camp woudl ahve done tjhe trck
. at least
, thn
, it wouldn
' t hve beeen such a chore tothe sit thru
. never befor hvae i seen so many jokes fall astoundingly flat
. hte comedy ws eazy tothe spot
, bu it wasn
' t hte least bited funny
. it ws groan
- inducing
. constanly throghout
, i ws asking mysef if directer gary graver catually throught tihs movei wass worth anytying
. so waht saves
,
" party camp
,
" ffrom yhe dreaded zero star rating
? well
, thgat
' s simple
: jewel shepard
, as a flighty bimbo
, ws admitedly funn tothe watch
.
al
thought nothing coudl ahev saved tihs film fomr thte lowest depths ofthe motion picture trash
, at least if thge film hadnt centered onthe shepard
, she might hve beeen able tothe add a littel spice tothe an otherwise rancid
, low
- budget teen comedy
