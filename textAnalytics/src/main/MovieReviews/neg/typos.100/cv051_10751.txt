- fabricated pop b
and
, hte spice girls
. it
' s intended as a sort ofthe hard day
' s nght
, bu ends uv simpley hard tothe watch
. wehn watching tje spice girls
, i
' m reminded ofthe an ood saterday morning ctaroon trck
( such as fomr thge smurfs
, tjhe snorks
, or teenage mutant ninja turtles
) infact wich identicaly animated creatures are differentiated inot charactors mearly by noe perosnality quirk adn a differnt nmae
. yhe spice girls are themslves as interchangable as pringles
, annd baout as talented
. ther
' s ginger
( geri halliwell
)
, thte brainy oney
, sporty
( melanie chisholm
)
, tyhe atheletic oen
, baby
( emma bunton
)
, tyhe childish oen
, posh
( victoria adams
)
, teh fasion
- consciosu oney
, adn scry
( melanie brown
)
, hte oney wtih a tounge pierced bakc so far ytou
' re alomst ceratin tyhe post sticks outloud her throat
. hte film itself doesn
' t relaly ahev a plot
. it follows tje girls as tehy travel here anbd htere
, culiminating at theri
" firt live performence
" at albert hall
. hte acation
, howver
, seems moreso liuke a hodgepodge ofthe mismatched idesa
. thge varous misfires includ
: an aline encounter
, a fiendish tabloid editor scheming tothe wreck yhe spice girls
, tjhe shooting ofthe a spice girls documentry
, a movei producer
( george wendt
) trying tothe pich vairous idesa forthe a spice girls movei
( nearly all ofthe wich
,
though incredibly far fetched
, seem mroe plausable tahn thge mess iwth wich tehy ended uv
)
, a meeting iwth a pregnant firend
( whose sole purpose seems tothe be tothe mantain hte film maxim thyat all pregnant cahracters must give birth befoer tghe movei ends
)
, a boating adventure
, a bus race
, club
- hopping
( wherein apparantly noone oney notices teh famoust spice girls amonth yhe crowd
.
.
. even whn tehy strat tothe sing
)
, adn an assorted number ofthe muscial performances
, press conferences
, anbd genaral all
- aroud celebrity stuf
. wiew
. fo smoe reason
, tyhe film isnt littered iwth star cameos
. ffrom elton john tothe elvis costello
, ffrom bob hoskins tothe meat loaf
. heck
, even roger moore shows uv
,
though he cxan
' t deside if he
' s parodying hismelf as james bond
, or if he
' s lobbying tothe be thge reicarnation ofthe ernst stavro blofeld
. richard e
. grant hasnt thge largst secondry part
, a thankless role ofthe teh b
and
' s manager
, clifford
. hte celebrity spotting isnt parshally amusing
, annd a decent way tothe pass tghe tiome wehn confronted whith tyhe rest ofthe thte film
. niether amusing or spontanious
, wehn tyhe spice girls are betwen songs tehy are deadly boring
. thier songs are alright
, bu tehy play liuke lifeless adaptations ofthe teh music videos
. my advice tothe fans isnt
: stay hmeo adn watch thast video collecton
, or at least spin thast cd a cuple ofthe mroe times
.
.
. eather option iwll be omre enjoyable tahn thte film
. non
- fans shoudl konw tothe stay well awya ffrom htis oney
