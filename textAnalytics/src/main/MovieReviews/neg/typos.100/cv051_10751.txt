talk baout a movei tht seemed dated befor it even hitted yhe theaters
! spice world isnt tjhe feature film debut ofthe thte pre
- fabricated pop band
, tjhe spice girls
. it ' s intended as a sort ofthe hard day ' s nigth
,
bu ends uv simpley hard tothe watch
. wehn watching tje spice girls
, i ' m reminded ofthe an ood saterday morning ctaroon trck
( such as ffrom thge smurfs
, thge snorks
, or teenage mutant ninja turtles
) inaddition whitch identicaly animated creatures are differentiated inot cahracters mearly by oen perosnality quirk
anbd a differnt nmae
. tjhe spice girls are themselfs as interchangable as pringles
,
anbd baout as talented
. ther ' s ginger
( geri halliwell
)
, tghe brainy oen
, sporty
( melanie chisholm
)
, tyhe atheletic noe
, baby
( emma bunton
)
, tyhe childish noe
, posh
( victoria adams
)
, tghe fasion
- conceous oney
,
annd scray
( melanie brown
)
, tjhe noe withthe a tounge pierced bakc so far ytou ' re allmost certian yhe post sticks outloud her throat
. thge film itself doesn ' t realy ahve a plot
. it follows thte girls as htey travel here
anbd ther
, culiminating at theri
" frist live peformance
" at albert hall
. yhe acation
,
howver
, seems omre liuke a hodgepodge ofthe mismatched idaes
. yhe varous misfires inlude
: an aline encounter
, a fiendish tabloid editor scheming tothe wreck tghe spice girls
, tghe shooting ofthe a spice girls documentry
, a movei producer
( george wendt
) trying tothe pich vairous idaes forthe a spice girls movei
( nearly all ofthe wich
,
though incredibly far fetched
, seem omre plausable thna hte mess withthe whic tehy ended uv
)
, a meeting iwth a pregnant freind
( whose sole purpose seems tothe be tothe manetain tjhe film maxim tht all pregnant charactors must give birth befor yhe movei ends
)
, a boating adventure
, a bus race
, club
- hopping
( wherein apparantly noone oney notices thge famouse spice girls amoung tghe crowd
.
.
. even whn htey strat tothe sing
)
,
adn an assorted number ofthe muscial performances
, press conferences
,
annd genaral all
- aroud celebrity stuf
. wiew
. fo soem reason
, hte film isnt littered wih star cameos
. fomr elton john tothe elvis costello
, ffrom bob hoskins tothe meat loaf
. heck
, even roger moore shows uv
,
though he cant ' t deside if he ' s parodying himselv as james bond
, or if he ' s lobbying tothe be yhe reicarnation ofthe ernst stavro blofeld
. richard e
. grant hasnt yhe largst secondry part
, a thankless role ofthe yhe band ' s manager
, clifford
. tjhe celebrity spotting isnt parshally amusing
,
adn a decent way tothe pass hte tyme whn confronted whith tyhe rest ofthe thge film
. niether amusing or spontanious
, wehn tjhe spice girls are beetwen songs tehy are deadly boring
. theri songs are alright
,
bu htey play liek lifeless adaptations ofthe yhe music videos
. my advice tothe fans isnt
: stay hmeo
annd watch taht video collecton
, or at least spin thyat cd a cuple ofthe omre times
.
.
. eather option iwll be mroe enjoyable tahn thge film
. non
- fans shoud knwo tothe stay well awya ffrom htis oney
