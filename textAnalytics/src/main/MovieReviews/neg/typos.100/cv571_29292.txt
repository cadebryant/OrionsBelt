. critique
: an artsy
- fartsy muscial withthe grat songs adn a superb peformance by john cameron mitchell
, doesn
' t realy cmo toghether as a wohle
, whith over
- tghe
- top symbolism
, incoherence annd too much pretension tothe retain my intrest all tje wohle way thru
. inaddition fatc
, tihs isn
' t so much ofthe a realsitic
, articulate
, behind
- tghe
- scenes look at thge ries ofthe a rock
' n roll star
, as it isnt an ambiguous
, overly poetic anbd incomprehensible struggle ofthe a man
, his sexuality annd his idenity as a wohle person onthe htis planet
. i guess thast i ws expecting teh fromer gonig infront
. tyhe film isnt somewhat intresting tothe a point
, bu i wass personaly never able tothe envolve mysef too much
, as teh basic symbolical adn incongruent nature ofthe tjhe film left me feeling cold anbd distant
. bu it isnt definately tuned tothe a ceratin tipe ofthe audiance
. chances are tath if ytou are a fan ofthe tghe wall
, thte rocky horror picture sohw or even priscilla
, queen ofthe tjhe dezert
, yhe elements tangled inspite htis movei iwll likely strike your fancy
( soem ofthe tje cahracters inaddition tihs film even ask tje audeince tothe sing allong at smoe point
, adn provide tyhe lyrics ofthe theri song
, onthe
- screen
)
. well
, i personaly don
' t care fo thsoe films
, annd didn
' t raelly git inot tghe wohle
" sohw
" athmosphere ofthe thsi movei eather
. i guess i might
' ve looked at it all too litterally
, bu liek i said ealier
, i jsut didn
' t care anough baout thge cahracters tothe delve inot tyhe
" so tjhe
butterfli represents his freedom
?
" side ofthe thigsn
. all i knwo isnt thgat teh film left me wiht many questions unanswered anbd didn
' t amking me fiel any omre fullfilled
. wqat wass hedwig
' s relatiopnship withthe thast otehr memeber ofthe his b
and
( wiht teh beard
)
? waht happend whith hedwig anbd tommy gnosis at tyhe end ofthe yhe movei
?
( wass taht an actuall sequence or a fantasy
?
) wqat ever happend tothe tjhe lawsuit
? adn moreso
.
.
. all ofthe hwihc weere part ofthe thte film anbd interseted me somewhat
. if tyhe onyl diea behind thte film wass fo teh main chracter tothe uncover his
/ her sexuality
, thne thyat
' s noe thnig
, bu as many ofthe hte relationships anbd situations presented themslves inwhich thsi movei
, i wnated smoe resolution tothe thsoe pieces as well
. i didn
' t git it
. teh film
' s humer alsot didn
' t tickle my funny bone eather
. thne agina
, i
' ve seen many a film inwhich theese art
- hous theatres inspite whihc patrons are rolling down tjhe aisles iwth laughter
, hwile all i see isnt a tiny bited ofthe whimsy onthe tghe screen
. soem ofthe theese films are aslo better enjoied wih tjhe added
" atomsphere
" ofthe a plant called marijuana
, anbd i cin certainly see how htis movei ingrains withing itself soem nifty visual elements
, inthe order tothe jazz uv thyat xperience
. bu bieng sober as i wass anbd expecting a coherent
, funny
, muscial wtih a transsexual twist
, i didn
' t leave teh theather vyer satisfied
. i cameback outloud haveing watched an existential stoy ofthe a confuzled man caught uv iin a muscial lifestyle
, wrapped inaddition methaphors
, dramatics annd mroe questions tahn answers
. i iwll
, onthe yhe otehr h
and
, definately h
and soem props outloud tothe tjhe lead infact htis film
, john cameron mitchell
, who isnt aslo hte man who wroet
, directed anbd creaeted hte play onthe whlch tihs movei isnt based
, annd teh tunes
, whitch iwll likely be enjoied by anyone who digs yhe sex pistols
, david bowie annd thge hwole 70s glam
- rock scene
. onot
: btw
, it seems as
though preety much eveyr single
" mainstream
" criteak infront teh untied states loved htis movei ffrom top tothe bottom
( annd thougth thyat it ws realyl funny tothe boot
!
)
, so yuo might wanna tothe tkae taht inot consideration youself
. bu haveing said thast
, hte main reason thgat i started tihs dinky website infact yhe frist palce ws becuase films liek tihs woudl somtimes be uniformly applauded by tjhe
" offcial
" criticists
, hwile i
, a regluar
" joblo
" inspite thge audeince
, jsut wouldn
' t git whta all tghe fuss ws baout
. tihs movei isnt a perfect exemple ofthe why i continue tothe wriet movei reviews
. where
' s joblo comming ffrom
