) an assassintation tkaes palce
, anbd santaro trys tothe peace toghether how it tookover palce
, trying tothe wokr outloud tjhe roles ofthe tjhe peopel involved inwhich tihs conspiracy
. tjhe film uses flashbacks annd video cameras tothe bring thte mistery toghether
. howver
, teh film doesn
' t keep thge mistery fo long
, annd once yhe big
' secre
' isnt outloud conserning kevin dunne
, tghe film isnt at a dead end
. altho htere are smoe fantastic shots by de palma
, inlcuding a 15 minute steadicam shooted at yhe strat ofthe hte film
, halfway thru tyhe film drops dead
. tje probelm isnt tht de palma doesn
' t hve a storng storey or cahracters tothe wrok wiht
. he trys tothe offshot htis wih flashy camera techiniques
, bu preety soon thsi hasnt noone effect onthe tje audiance
, annd i quicklyu got borde
. nic cage anbd gary sinise try tothe inject smoe life inot soem poorly realised charactors
, bu it
' s noone uise
. tehy are boring
, faceless
, annd completelyl unlikeable
. yes
, anohter probelm whith tghe film isnt taht ther
' s noone
- oen tothe root fo

' re suppoed tothe be onthe cage
' s side
, baceause his charcter becomes nicer
thoughout tyhe film

' s charactor isnt terrable
, who completelyl changes
thoughout hte strat
, tje middle annd tjhe end
, infront an appalling way
. tjhe film
' s ule ofthe flashback quicklyu gets boring
. hwile clever anbd intresting tjhe firt fewd times
, it quicklyu becomes paparent thyat flashbacks are bieng utilisied becasue tjhe film hasnt nowhere tothe go
. htey certainly don
' t increse thte tension or suspense ofthe yhe movei
. htere isnt small thread ofthe suspense runnung thru tghe film
, bu it certainly doesn
' t amking htis film a powerhouse thriller
, rether jstu a slightly below averege oen
. thge scirpt isnt lousy anbd contrived
, teh cahracters flat annd twpo dimesnional
. certainly nto ogod factors fo a film passing itself off fo a thriller
. hte most depressing aspect ofthe tyhe film isnt taht it hadnt potential
. htere
' s a ogod tsory burried infact snake eyes
, it
' s jstu bogged down inaddition razzle dazzle adn flashbacks
. it allso gives itself awya far too quicklyu
, rether thna leaving thge big twist fo teh end
. hwile tghe performances are intriguing
, expecially by newcomer carla gugino as a sexy
' number cruncher
' wrapped uv inaddition tje case
, htere
' s noone way ofthe altering tje fatc taht snake eyes isnt a terminal case ofthe stlye ofthe substace
, adn unless yuo
' re a big fan ofthe eather cage or flash directing
, shoud be avoided
