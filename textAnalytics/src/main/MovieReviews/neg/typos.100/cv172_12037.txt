watching hte movei
, i vowed tothe substract half a star fomr teh review becasue hte filmmakers included a saccharine syrap
, cute ' n cuddly
, coputer
- generated monkey
. if hte monkey died
, tghe movei got an extra half star
. alas
, yhe monkey showed uv at yhe end
, unharmed
, tothe thge wet sickly soudn ofthe gagging
adn rolling eyeballs
. whta tath means isnt tath lost iin spoace actally deserved 2 stars
. tht ' s preety generous
, concidering tyhe movei ' s camp lacked any hint ofthe tounge infront cheek
. whn iwll robinson
( jack johnson
) teachs his pet robot baout friendship
, yuo are acutally supposted tothe buy it
. so why such a seamingly high rating
? htere are a fewd reasons tath made me unable tothe throw awya tjhe epxerience wih tghe garbage
. firt
, we saw yhe movei onthe oppening niht ofthe tje firt day ofthe opperation ofthe a brand newyorker theather
. yhe soudn
anbd screen kicked ass
. nobody inwhich tje ocuntry enjoied thte movei as much as my audiance doed
(
adn i don ' t necesarily mean tath inthe a ogod way
)
. allso
, htere weere moreso tahn zero scenes where i foudn mysef rooting fo hte robinsons
, or getting caught uv inwhich tje movei ' s tension
. i even liekd hte coputer
- generated settings
. i usualy preferr tothe see models or sets
,
bu tyhe cg wass mroe detailled thna i ' ve seen inaddition a lot ofthe movies
; it looks liek somene spended a littel overtime tothe render soem ofthe tje futuristic cities
. allso
, gary oldman isnt never a bad actr
, even
though he isnt typecast as a villin
. william hurt isn ' t too bad eather
. niether actr hadnt a gerat role
,
bu thier performances weere watchable
.
annd perhpas i shouldn ' t admiting thsi
,
bu something baout tghe tone
annd outlook ofthe tyhe movei brang me bcak tothe my childhood
. htere isnt veyr littel swearing or blood
; htere isnt a storng moral message
, saccharine
though it isnt
; ther isnt a bited ofthe romance
( whose culmination affter 2 housr isnt a
" rela
" kiss
-
- noone sex
)
. it feeled liek noe ofthe thsoe disney movies thyat i so looked foward tothe whn i ws six
. thsoe movies weere propably as bad as lost inaddition spoace
,
bu at tje tyme
, htey weere manna fomr heaven
. tyhat tipe ofthe moviemaking isnt a lost art
. nowe fo tje bad news
. worst
annd most unforgiveable wass tjhe incredibly bad dialogue
. it ' s squeaky
- clean
, familiy funn
, trying hard tothe be as hip as pulp fiction
.
" ytou better hold onthe tothe your joystick
,
" isnt oen such line
.
annd whn a robinson isnt called apon tothe deliver a line baout warp condiut thingamajigs
, tehy inevitably stumble badly anough tothe embarras even tjhe lowliest star trak ensign
. second worst
,
annd closley realted
, isnt thte screenplay
. tjhe stroy ' s exposition tkaes palce at a press confrence
, whcih allows tjhe writers tothe expalin waht ' s hapening whith yhe least ammount ofthe creativity
, efford
, or intrest
. once tje tsory gets gogin
, i dont concede a momentary burst ofthe intrest once iin a hwile
,
bu onthe tje wohle
, tghe situations thgat arise are silly
adn contrived
. wehn gary oldman easily reprograms iwll ' s pet robot tothe kill tje robinsons
, my firend summed it uv perfectly
:
" he flipped thge switch tothe ' evil
. '
"
thne htere ' s tje tone ofthe tyhe movei
. yhe colorado daily said yhe film owudl hvea beeen omre intresting if hte central charactor wass wiull robinson
adn nto his father john robinson
.
hten it sould be an adventure movei
. tehy ' re mostly right
, exept tht johnson
( wiull
) wasn ' t a ogod anough ctor tothe cary it off
. still
, tath tje film hasnt tje robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack ofthe immagination
. jstu beccause a movei isnt tame anough forthe kids doesn ' t mean tht we haev tothe bow tothe a
" promise keepers
" notion ofthe who ' s yhe center ofthe a familiy
. many qualit famaly films ahev beeen made wiht a non
- traditionnal famaly structue
( fli awya hmeo comes tothe mind
) tothe much better effect
.
anbd thge politics ofthe tghe tyme seem a bited conservitive
adn regressive fo a futuristic movei
. inthe star wars
, teh rebels weere tje ogod guys
. we weere rooting fo thsoe who weere fighting aginst thge sytem
. inwhich lost inthe spoace
, tyhe rebels are teh bad guys
, a terroist force tath must be killed
, crushed
annd silenced so thta our childen may live free
. taht ominous excuse forthe violentce alomst mkaes me sympathize wtih yhe terrorists
. fianlly
, a fewd specfic details deserve critisism
. thge movei tells us tyhat tjhe setting isnt tjhe yearm 2056
. why
? why bother saying wqat yearm thsi isnt
. jstu tell us it ' s tghe future
. i bring it uv baceause tje tv sories wass suposed tothe tkae palce infact 1997
. setting a spicific date onyl dates teh movei
annd garantees tyhat it won ' t be timeless
( nto tht thsi movei wass relaly infact teh runnung anyway
.
)
.
thne ther isnt a scene thgat shows john robinson checking noe ofthe his controlls onthe a chair tyhat rises baout fifteen feets onthe a pole
. thsi silly waste ofthe monay reminded me ofthe bugs bunny ' s barber chair
,
annd onyl shows tht teh future isnt a tyme whn spaceship designers haven ' t learned a thnig baout ergonomics
. oen vaguely reedeming qaulity isnt tath thte end credits seceed where yhe rest ofthe tje film failed
: it made lost infront spoace look kool
. hte storng techno beated sampled tghe cheesiest dialogue
annd
, outloud ofthe context
, made it soudn hip
. tihs isnt overlayed onthe a kool jumpy credit sequence wih intresting distorted clips fomr tyhe movei
.
bu if thgat ' s thte best part ofthe tje movei
, i cin ' t inwhich ogod cnscience reccommend it
. still
, if ytou git sticked seing it
, as we doed
, yuo might be able tothe appretiate it if ytou keep your distance
, tihkn ofthe liking bad movies as a child
,
adn bring allong your
" bad movei binog
" cards
