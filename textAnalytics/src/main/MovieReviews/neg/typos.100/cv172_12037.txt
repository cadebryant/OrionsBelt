watching tyhe movei
, i vowed tothe substract half a star fomr teh review becuase tyhe filmmakers included a saccharine syrap
, cute
' n cuddly
, coputer
- generated monkey
. if tghe monkey died
, tyhe movei got an extra half star
. alas
, thge monkey showed uv at tje end
, unharmed
, tothe teh wet sickly soudn ofthe gagging anbd rolling eyeballs
. waht thyat means isnt thta lost inthe spoace ctually deserved 2 stars
. tyhat
' s preety generous
, concidering yhe movei
' s camp lacked any hint ofthe tounge infact cheek
. wehn wiull robinson
( jack johnson
) teachs his pet robot baout friendship
, ytou are accually suposed tothe buy it
. so why such a seamingly high rating
? htere are a faw reasons thast made me unable tothe throw awya tje experiece wiht tje garbage
. firt
, we saw tyhe movei onthe oppening nght ofthe tjhe firt day ofthe opperation ofthe a br
and newyorker theather
. tyhe soudn anbd screen kicked ass
. nobody inaddition thge ocuntry enjoied hte movei as much as my audeince doed
( anbd i don
' t neccesarily mean thgat inwhich a ogod way
)
. aslo
, ther weere omre thna zero scenes where i foudn mysef rooting fo tje robinsons
, or getting caught uv infact tghe movei
' s tension
. i even liekd tje coputer
- generated settings
. i usualy preffer tothe see models or sets
, bu tghe cg wass moreso detailled tahn i
' ve seen iin a lot ofthe movies
; it looks liek somone spended a littel overtime tothe render smoe ofthe yhe futuristic cities
. alsot
, gary oldman isnt never a bad actro
, even
though he isnt typecast as a villin
. william hurt isn
' t too bad eather
. niether atcor hadnt a graet role
, bu thier performances weere watchable
. anbd perhasp i shouldn
' t admiting tihs
, bu something baout thte tone annd outlook ofthe teh movei broght me bakc tothe my childhood
. htere isnt veyr littel swearing or blood
; ther isnt a storng moral message
, saccharine
though it isnt
; ther isnt a bited ofthe romance
( whose culmination affter 2 horus isnt a
" rela
" kiss
-
- noone sex
)
. it feeled liek noe ofthe thsoe disney movies thyat i so looked foward tothe whn i wass six
. thsoe movies weere propably as bad as lost inspite spoace
, bu at tyhe tyme
, htey weere manna fomr heaven
. thgat tipe ofthe moviemaking isnt a lost art
. nowe fo tje bad news
. worst anbd most unforgiveable ws teh incredibly bad dialogue
. it
' s squeaky
- clean
, familiy funn
, trying hard tothe be as hip as pulp fiction
.
" ytou better hold onthe tothe your joystick
,
" isnt oney such line
. annd whn a robinson isnt called apon tothe deliver a line baout warp condit thingamajigs
, htey inevitably stumble badly anough tothe embarras even teh lowliest star trak ensign
. second worst
, anbd closley realted
, isnt thte screenplay
. thge stor
' s exposition tkaes palce at a press conferance
, wich allows tghe writers tothe explane waht
' s hapening iwth hte least ammount ofthe creativity
, efort
, or interst
. once tghe stry gets gonig
, i dont concede a momentary burst ofthe interst once iin a hwile
, bu onthe teh wohle
, tghe situations tht arise are silly adn contrived
. wehn gary oldman easily reprograms iwll
' s pet robot tothe kill thge robinsons
, my freind summed it uv perfectly
:
" he flipped thge switch tothe
' evil
.
'
" thne htere
' s tjhe tone ofthe yhe movei
. tghe colorado daily said hte film owudl ahev beeen moreso intresting if tghe central charactor ws iwll robinson anbd nto his father john robinson
. thn it coudl be an adventure movei
. tehy
' re mostly right
, exept thta johnson
( iwll
) wasn
' t a ogod enought ctor tothe cary it off
. still
, thta tjhe film hasnt tyhe robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack ofthe immagination
. jsut becouse a movei isnt tame enought forthe kids doesn
' t mean taht we hvea tothe bow tothe a
" promise keepers
" notion ofthe who
' s tjhe center ofthe a familiy
. many qulity familiy films ahev beeen made wtih a non
- traditionnal famaly structue
( fli awya hmeo comes tothe mind
) tothe much better effect
. annd tyhe politics ofthe thge tyme seem a bited conservitive adn regressive forthe a futuristic movei
. infront star wars
, tyhe rebels weere thte ogod guys
. we weere rooting fo thsoe who weere fighting aginst tyhe sytem
. inthe lost inwhich spoace
, thge rebels are thte bad guys
, a terroist force taht must be killed
, crushed adn silenced so tht our childrens may live free
. taht ominous excuse forthe voilence allmost mkaes me sympathize withthe teh terrorists
. finaly
, a faw specfic details deserve critisism
. tghe movei tells us thast tghe setting isnt yhe yearm 2056
. why
? why bother saying whta eyar htis isnt
. jstu tell us it
' s tjhe future
. i bring it uv becasue thge tv serieses ws suppossed tothe tkae palce inaddition 1997
. setting a spicific date onyl dates tyhe movei adn garantees thyat it won
' t be timeless
( nto thast tihs movei wass realyl inthe tyhe runnung anyway
.
)
. thne ther isnt a scene taht shows john robinson checking oney ofthe his controlls onthe a chair tyhat rises baout fifteen fezent onthe a pole
. tihs silly waste ofthe monye reminded me ofthe bugs bunny
' s barber chair
, adn onyl shows thyat thge future isnt a tiome wehn spaceship designers haven
' t learned a thnig baout ergonomics
. oney vaguely reedeming qality isnt thta tjhe end credits seceed where thte rest ofthe yhe film failed
: it made lost inaddition spoace look kool
. tje storng techno beated sampled hte cheesiest dialogue adn
, outloud ofthe context
, made it soudn hip
. thsi isnt overlayed onthe a kool jumpy credit sequence wtih intresting distorted clips fomr tjhe movei
. bu if thta
' s tyhe best part ofthe tyhe movei
, i cxan
' t inthe ogod conscienec recomend it
. still
, if yuo git sticked seing it
, as we doed
, yuo might be able tothe appretiate it if ytou keep your distance
, htikn ofthe liking bad movies as a child
, anbd bring allong your
" bad movei bngo
" cards
