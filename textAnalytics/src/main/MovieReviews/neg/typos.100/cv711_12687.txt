. unlike most movies thsi oney doens nto suffer fomr
" stupid bad guy
" syndrome

. nowe teh bad guy isnt
, liuke
, stoned
, man
, so he leaves his shotgun enxt tothe our hero
.
( term utilizied as loosley as possable
) survival instincts
adn a ogod dose ofthe common sence seems tothe suggest grabing tghe shotgun
, whitch our hero doens
,
bu onyl aftter contemplating it fo baout thirty seconds
. even wehn he doesnt grab it he seems unsure how tothe hold it
, goign so far as tothe actaully wonder if he shoud palce a finger near teh trigger
. mind yuo
, i ' ve never fired a shotgun inaddition my life
bu beleave ytou me thyat yhe bad guy owudl be missing most ofthe his vital organs
