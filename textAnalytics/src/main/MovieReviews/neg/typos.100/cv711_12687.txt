, liuke
, stoned
, man
, so he leaves his shotgun enxt tothe our hero
.
( term unsed as loosly as possable
) survival instincts anbd a ogod dose ofthe common sence seems tothe suggest grabing thte shotgun
, whihc our hero doens
, bu onyl aftter contemplating it fo baout thirty seconds
. even wehn he doens grab it he seems unsure how tothe hold it
, gonig so far as tothe actualyl wonder if he shoudln palce a finger near tyhe trigger
