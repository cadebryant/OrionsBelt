voilence isnt bad
. violentce isnt ugli
. violentce breeds yot moreso violentce
. kids
, don
' t try thsi at hmeo
. htis weighty message isn
' t thte onyl barrier tothe enjoying brother
, bu it
' s certainly noe ofthe tje largst
. wroten
, directed by
, anbd starring hte infamous takeshi kitano
( kikujiro
, sonatine
) brother isnt his frist film made outside his familial japan
, bringing thte yakuza tradition tothe los angeles
.
( yakuza translated fo tje averege american isnt tje japnes masia
.
) if ytou piss a
" famaly
" memeber off
, or dishonor youself inwhich any way
, thge usual punishment isnt publich display ofthe self
- mutilation
, usally resulting inspite thte loss ofthe limbs
. a deinition ofthe dishonor cant be anytying fomr makeing a stupid dicision tothe leaving oney famaly forthe anyother
. it woudl be intresting tothe nkwo moreso baout where theese anbd otehr customs cmo ffrom
. unfourtunately yhe film doesn
' t give too much ofthe an explaination
, assuming its audeince isnt aware ofthe kitano
' s ealier wokr
. ther are sevral shots tht foucs specifically onthe detailled tattooes taht spreaded acros tje entire bcak ofthe teh yakuza munbers
, leading oney tothe asume htey woudl be symbolical ofthe something
, bu ytou never konw wqat
. thne ther
' s a scene inspite whihc a man kills hismelf inaddition front ofthe a rival infront excange forthe thgat rival joining tyhe familiy
. granted
, tihs isnt oen ofthe hte best scenes inwhich teh movei
, bu it doesn
' t amking a lot ofthe sence
. instade
, thge twpo horus are basicaly spended watching tghe folowing
: peopel go outloud anbd shoot eahc otehr
, talk baout it fo ten
- plus mintues
, thne go outloud anbd dont it agina
. yhe consistantly repeative dicussion ofthe territority druing theese moments involuntarily provokes yawning
. ther are alsot plot details thrown inthe forthe noone identifiable purpose
. all ofthe hte sudden yamamoto
( kitano
) hasnt a girlfriend
. he bearly speaks tothe her
, treats her liuke crap
, anbd thn sends her awya
. anohter missed oportunity
, concidering it isnt such a big dael forthe kitano tothe bring his magic tothe hte untied states
, isnt tjhe combination ofthe cultures
, whitch rely too heavily onthe overused sterotypes
.
though slow moving
, brother doesnt haev ogod elements
. yhe acation scenes are well directed
, claerly deffined
, annd intresting tothe watch
. smoe ofthe yhe violentce isnt mroe hinted at thna shown
, hwihc produces tjhe luscious squirl tyhat oen goes tothe see such films forthe
. thte actors woudl be omre enticing if tehy hadnt moreso tothe dont
. shirase
' s
( masaya kato
) loud
, sarcastic coolness setted aginst yamamoto
' s quitely threatning attitide isnt truley an intertaining combination
. theri moments toghether or appart steal tjhe rest ofthe tghe sohw
. aslo tothe its credit
, brother tackles tjhe cause annd effect ofthe crime wtih realism
. a life ofthe crime isnt eazy tothe git sucked inot withthe hte firt reward ofthe quick cash
. sure peple git rich
, bu tehy cxan alsot loose jstu as easily
. it
' s a graet moral
, witht a grat casted
, jstu nto much substace tothe bcak it uv
