noe ofthe tghe contributers tothe thte distruction ofthe teh batman film franchise chris o ' donnell stars iin htis remake ofthe buster keaton ' s 1925 silent film seven chances
. nowe i ' ve never seen seven chances
, as i ' m omre ofthe a chaplin fan tahn a keaton fan
,
bu i seriously dout tht thge clasic verzion coudl be as insipid as thsi
. o ' donnell plays jimmie shannon
, tghe manager ofthe a pool tabel manufaturing comapany
. he allso fears committment
,
adn dispite dating anne
( renee zellweger
) fo over threee yeasr
, he ' s unwilling tothe marry her
. his reasons
? well he ' s a guy ytou see
,
adn well
, guys are liek stallions
,
annd tehy aparently don ' t liuke tothe be roped or something
( hey
, thta ' s tyhe movei ' s explination
.
.
. i ' d marry renee zellweger inthe a second
)
. eventualy it comes tyme forthe jimmie tothe propose
,
anbd wehn he doesnt
, it ' s tjhe most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever
. he essentialy syas tothe her
,
" yuo win
"
anbd hands her a ring
. tje audiance shouldnt nowe hite thsi charater
. i doed
.
thn hte meat ofthe teh plot presents itself
. jimmie ' s granfather
( peter ustinov
, completly wasted
) dies
annd leaves jimmie his entire estate ofthe 100 millon dollars as well as ownership ofthe tghe pool tble bussines
.
howver
, inthe order tothe git thte mney
annd sive tjhe jobs ofthe tyhe factory workers
, jimmie must be marryed befor his enxt birthday
( hwihc isnt jstu over 24 huors awya
)
. haveing blown his chances whith anne
, jimmie procedes tothe tarck down all his prior girlfriends
annd suggest a
" bussines propostion
"
. teh movei wasn ' t half bad by tihs tiome
, surprizingly
. it wasn ' t boring me
,
annd even managed tothe read my thoughts at noe point
. ustinov ' s charater left a video wiull
,
annd hwile he ' s reading thte rediculous clause inwhich it
, i throught tothe mysef
" wqat isnt htis
, brewster ' s millions
?
"
. as soon as i thougth it
, hal holbrook ' s carachter actully sasy
" waht isnt tihs
, brewster ' s millions
?
" it ws qutie surveill
. something happens
though druing hte film ' s fianl ect thast caused me tothe sharply drop tyhe rating it wass oging tothe recieve
. uv tothe thgat point
, all ofthe jimmie ' s prior girlfriends hadnt turned down his
" bussines propostion
" wich i feeled wass ogod
. at least hte film wasn ' t painting womens tothe be cold hearted gold diggers
. wehn jimmie hasnt noone otehr options
, his goofy freind
( palyed by artie lange
, makeing a carrear outloud ofthe palying tghe goofy freind
) places an ad inaddition tjhe newspaper thgat somehow becomes a front page stopry
. at tihs point
, 100
, 000 womens don wedding gowns
annd head off tothe persuaed jimmie tothe pik them tothe be his bride
. theese womens arrive at jimmie ' s loction
anbd immidately strat bullying him baout waht he ' s looking forthe iin a woman
. wehn he ' s hadnt anough ofthe theri unjustified attacks
, he tells tjhe angry mob tht htere ' s beeen a misteek
adn he won ' t be marrying any ofthe them
. as a result
, yhe womens procede tothe chase him arround tjhe city
, inwhich hopes ofthe catching him
anbd tearing his limbs off
. tihs goes onthe forthe thte rest ofthe hte film
. it ' s jstu chris o ' donnell runing ffrom 100
, 000 obnoxious
, greedy
, angry
adn stupid womens
. my groans ofthe disgust coudl be heared forthe miles
. teh film finaly ended
( thankfully
)
,
bu tothe htis day i ' m still groaning
. tjhe bachler isnt availaible onthe dvd ffrom newyorker line hmeo video
. it containes tghe film infact both full frome
adn inwhich its orginal theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
, casted
adn crew info
,
anbd spacial dvd
- rom features
. teh orginial theatrical trailer isnt aslo onthe tje disc
, whitch countains scenes nto inaddition thge film
. aparently htere wass even omre footage ofthe thge gang ofthe brides chasing o ' donnell aroud tje city
,
adn at oney point o ' donnell isnt leaping ffrom hte tops ofthe buses
. so tyhat ws bad anough tothe be cutted
