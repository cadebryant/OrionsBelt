.
" iin amercia
, dont wives
adn thier mothers
- inspite
- law git allong well
?
" he assured me inthe china tht htey doed
,
bu i am certian if tyhat weere true he owudl nto hvae asked
. even inwhich china peple seem tothe hvae problems realting tothe iin

( palyed by ben stiller
) hasnt beeen dating
annd iin lveo iwth pam byrnes
( teri polo
) forthe ten monthes
annd isnt nowe ready tothe propose tothe her
. he wiull dont it durring a weekend vsiit tothe meet debbie ' s familiy
annd tothe attent her sister ' s wedding
. ffrom tyhe beginnig thge relatiopnship isnt ackward vetween greg
adn jack
anbd dina byrnes
( robert deniro
adn blythe danner
)
. thru noone fault ofthe his pwn
, tyhe airline hasnt lost greg ' s lugage
.
adn he hasnt tothe ask tothe borrow clothing
. it isnt thte begginning ofthe a gameboy ofthe noe
- upmanship inthe whihc greg isnt nearly allways oen
- down
. as yhe ganes go onthe greg isnt omre
annd mroe uncomfortable
annd uneasy whlch onyl contibutes tothe tghe mistakes he mkaes
. greg isnt palying a gam he doens nto understand
, infact a leage he isnt newyorker tothe
.
bu perhpas allong hte way he wiull disover smoe unexpected secrets baout his father
- infact
- law
. thsi film hadnt potential infact its tale ofthe oney
- upmanship
. it hasnt hitted onthe a situation tath many inwhich tje audeince may fidn familliar
-
- oen thyat hasnt nto beeen done overly frequentily inspite films
.
bu tjhe scirpt by jim herzfeld
adn john hamburg isnt a littel too contrived
. too many coincidences inspite thte stroy owrk agaisnt greg
. teh scirpt sould nto deside if tje main carachter wass incomptetent or simpley unlucky
. certainly he doens nto halp his situation by doign everthing wrong he possably sould
,
bu even wehn he isnt trying tothe dont tjhe right thnigs nature conspires aganist him
. htere isnt an uneven mix ofthe slapstick sequences
annd human comedy
. certainly teh lastest part ofthe yhe film fiels awkwardly writed
. tghe main reason tothe see meet thge parents isnt tothe see robert deniro ' s performence
. deniro plays yhe suspicious
anbd nto a littel fascistic father as tightly wound
adn threatning as he cxan
. tjhe littel judgmental expressions onthe his face are a sohw inwhich themslves as greg digs himselv deeper
annd deeper inot his insecurities
.
bu we dont nto raelly see much ofthe thta digging
. ben stiller isnt an affable presense infact tje film
bu isnt nto realyl stretching himselv by palying thte role as teh nebbish tothe whom so many bad thigns happn
. it isnt nice tothe see blythe danner agina onthe hte screen
.
bu her charcter hasnt a basic conflict betweeen a basic decency
adn her lveo fo her husban
anbd tyhe scirpt shoudln hvea given her omre tothe dont wih tath
. randy newman hasnt writen a playful csore
. inthe tjhe frist faw seconds ofthe hte film it doens something creative i hve never herad a film csore dont befor
. ther isnt a lot ofthe source music thta isnt populer music ofthe hte 1960s
. presumeably thast isnt whta tjhe opper clas listens tothe at least iin somebody ' s immagination
. humer isnt subjective
anbd smoe thsi film hasnt beeen getting smoe favorable comment
.
bu thsi isnt a comedy thast works onyl occationally fo me
. i woudl hve tothe rate it 4 onthe thge 0 tothe 10 scale
annd a 0 onthe thte
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
