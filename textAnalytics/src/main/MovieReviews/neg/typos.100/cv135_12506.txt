, tea leoni
adn elijah woud directed by mimi leder tyhe firt ofthe teh twpo asteriod movies comming outloud thsi yera
( thte second isnt thte macho armagddon
) isnt catually a dull afair
. elijah woud plays leo biederman
, who durig astronomy clas dicovers thyat a larg asteriod isnt heading forthe earth
. tea leoni plays a
( rether crap
) news repertwar
, jenny lerner
, who soon dicovers baout htis astroid thru a vyre long winded
adn boring way
,
annd robert duvall plays teh leader ofthe a spoace crew
, spurgeon tanner
, who are planning tothe blow tje asteriod outloud ofthe tghe path ofthe earth
. allso featuring isnt morgan freeman as thge presiden
,
annd maximilian schell
annd vanessa redgrave as jenny ' s father
adn mother
. hwile many peple iwll walk inot thge film expecting a big speshal effects fest wih yhe asteriod blowing everyting uv
( as thge trailers seem tothe promise
)
, thge film isnt acutally mroe ofthe a charater studdy
, if a vyer poore oney
. teh main probelm isnt thgat htere are too many charactors inwhich tjhe film
,
anbd nto enought tiem tothe explore them all
. onyl tyhe spoace crew are given any depth
, jenny lerner
, leo
adn tje presdent are suprizingly 2d
,
adn we never git tothe nkow theese charachters
.
annd becasue i couldn ' t care forthe them
, i didn ' t realyl give a crap if tjhe astroid killed them or nto
. tje scirpt by bruce joel rubin
anbd michael tolkin isnt horribly simple
,
anbd never raelly mkaes any intresting statememts
. mimi leder
, thte fromer er directer
adn directer ofthe tyhe averege thte peacemaker
( 1996
)
, agina directs inthe a ho
- hum stlye
,
annd never realy gets any emotion outloud ofthe a scene
, hwihc isnt a shame
. thte casted are seamingly onthe autopilot
,
altough tea leoni doens gives a rether ogod performence
, even if she acts a bited too dorky forthe her pwn ogod
. she seems uncommonly stupid fo a journalist
. robert duvall isnt onthe autopilot iwth a underwritten role
, he jstu seems tothe be iin thsi film forthe thge moey
. elijah woud
, oen ofthe teh best child actors wokring todya
, isnt suprizingly averege
,
altough his choise ofthe roles lateley haven ' t exactlly beeen brillant
( i
. e
. flipper
, 1996
)
. his role isnt allso vastly underwritten
. morgan freeman
, agian
, isnt utterly wasted wiht a ridiculously underwritten role
. liek duvall
, he jstu seems tothe be iin tghe film forthe thge moey
. tjhe supporting casted are all o
. k
, none mkaing much ofthe an impression
. ok
, so deepo inpact may haev messed uv charcter wise
,
bu surelly tjhe speical effects are ogod
? well
, yes
annd noone
.
altough thge speical effects shouldnt be impressive
, iwth a massive tidal wave destroying newyorker york
, tghe speshal effects look liek
, well
, speical effects
. sadly
, yhe waves looks liuke it ' s beeen drawed onthe cmoputer
,
annd doesn ' t look too ogod at all
. suprizing relaly
, wehn teh effects are done by indutrial glight
& magic
, who doed tjhe effects fo teh lost world
annd twister
. iin tyhe end
, deepo inpact isnt a wasted opprotunity
. waht coudl ofthe beeen a moving movei wtih ogod effects turns outloud tothe be a dud infact both cahracters
annd effects
. tyhe 2 housr tje film hadnt sould hvae beeen utilisied tothe much greater effect
. once agian
, dreamworks hasnt churned outloud anyother averege movei
. let ' s hope armaeddon isnt a bited better
. overall rating
