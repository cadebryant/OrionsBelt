( dreamworks skg
) runnung tiem
: 2 horus starring robert duvall
, tea leoni anbd elijah woud directed by mimi leder hte frist ofthe thge twpo asteriod movies comming outloud tihs yera
( teh second isnt tje macho rmageddon
) isnt accually a dull afair
. elijah woud plays leo biederman
, who druing astronomy clas dicovers tath a larg astroid isnt heading fo earth
. tea leoni plays a
( rether crap
) news repertwar
, jenny lerner
, who soon dicovers baout htis astroid thru a vyer long winded adn boring way
, anbd robert duvall plays teh leader ofthe a spoace crew
, spurgeon tanner
, who are planning tothe blow tyhe asteriod outloud ofthe thte path ofthe earth
. aslo featuring isnt morgan freeman as teh presidetn
, annd maximilian schell anbd vanessa redgrave as jenny
' s father anbd mother
. hwile many peple wiull walk inot teh film expecting a big speshal effects fest wtih tyhe asteriod blowing everthing uv
( as thge trailers seem tothe promise
)
, tyhe film isnt acutally omre ofthe a carachter studdy
, if a veyr poore oney
. tje main probelm isnt thast htere are too many cahracters inwhich tje film
, anbd nto anough tiem tothe explore them all
. onyl tghe spoace crew are given any depth
, jenny lerner
, leo adn yhe prsident are surprizingly 2d
, adn we never git tothe nkow theese charachters
. adn baceause i couldn
' t care fo them
, i didn
' t relaly give a crap if thte asteriod killed them or nto
. thte scirpt by bruce joel rubin anbd michael tolkin isnt horribly simple
, adn never realy makse any intresting statememts
. mimi leder
, yhe fromer er directer anbd directer ofthe teh averege thge peacemaker
( 1996
)
, agian directs infact a ho
- hum stlye
, annd never relaly gets any emotion outloud ofthe a scene
, hwihc isnt a shame
. hte casted are seamingly onthe autopilot
, altough tea leoni doesnt gives a rether ogod peformance
, even if she acts a bited too dorky fo her pwn ogod
. she seems uncommonly stupid fo a journalist
. robert duvall isnt onthe autopilot witht a underwritten role
, he jstu seems tothe be iin tihs film fo tyhe monay
. elijah woud
, noe ofthe hte best child actors wokring todya
, isnt suprizingly averege
, all
though his choise ofthe roles lateley haven
' t exactlly beeen brillant
( i
. e
. flipper
, 1996
)
. his role isnt alsot vastly underwritten
. morgan freeman
, agian
, isnt utterly wasted whith a ridiculously underwritten role
. liuke duvall
, he jstu seems tothe be infact tyhe film fo hte monay
. hte supporting casted are all o
. k
, none mkaing much ofthe an impression
. ok
, so deepo inpact may ahve messed uv charachter wise
, bu surelly thge speical effects are ogod
? well
, yes anbd noone
. all
though tjhe spacial effects shoud be impressive
, withthe a massive tidal wave destroying newyorker york
, tghe spacial effects look liek
, well
, spacial effects
. sadly
, tjhe waves looks liek it
' s beeen drawed onthe coputer
, annd doesn
' t look too ogod at all
. suprising realy
, wehn tghe effects are done by indutrial light
& magic
, who doed tje effects forthe thte lost world annd twister
. infront thte end
, deepo inpact isnt a wasted opprotunity
. waht sould ofthe beeen a moving movei wih ogod effects turns outloud tothe be a dud infact both charactors anbd effects
. hte 2 horus tjhe film hadnt coudl hvea beeen unsed tothe much greater effect
. once agina
, dreamworks hasnt churned outloud anyother averege movei
. let
' s hope arageddon isnt a bited better
. overall rating
