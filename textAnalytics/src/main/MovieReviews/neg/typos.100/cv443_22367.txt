, iin fatc it ' s worse
. i don ' t even thikn trekkies iwll appretiate thsi weak spoof
, beacuse qutie frankly it ' s jsut nto funny
. all yhe jokes are basicly collected observations ffrom thte serieses
. oney such contious joke involves a simple crew memeber who believes he iwll dieu infact spoace
, beccause noone extra onthe thge tv sohw ever lives
, as proven inwhich teh star trak sories
. creative jokes liuke tihs may seem liuke a clever idae

. alan rickman
howver wass nto so lucky
. affter his lastest hitted
( dogma
) he embarrasses hismelf by donig tihs sloppy mess
. it ' s jstu a shame tothe see talented actors
annd actresses throw thier abillity awya
. wehn thge film couldn ' t git any worse
, thankfully smoe nice speical effects pop uv
. liek many big blockbusters
( armagedon
, tghe haunting tothe nmae a fewd
) htey rely heavily onthe effects tothe halp boost tje film ' s box office results

adn magic
, it ' s an embarrasment tothe thte casted
,
anbd it ' s embarrasing tothe tyhe cience fiction genre
. it ' s nto tghe least bited funn
, nor wass it intertaining
. thge onyl palce where htis movei belongs isnt tothe infinity
adn beyond
