" theese are thte firt words tht cameback tothe mind aftter it ws over
. wehn a movei isnt called
_ vampires
_
,
" nto csary
" aren
' t words tht shouldnt be asociated wih it
. bu thast wasn
' t my onyl gripe
. john carpentery isnt a nmae assoicated iwth cutting
- edge cinema
, as infact tjhe intense scares ofthe
_ hallwoeen
_
,
_ tjhe thign
_ anbd
_ tje prince ofthe darkness
_
, or thte offbeat acation ofthe
_ htey live
_ annd
_ excape ffrom newyorker york
_
. unfortunatley
, thte onyl hting thast isnt cutting edge baout
_ vampires
_ isnt hte levle ofthe boredom yhe movei isnt able tothe triarch
. wtih an anemic plot annd nto
- qtuie
- kosher speical effects
,
_ john carpentery
' s vampires
_ hasnt bearly enought substace tothe slake hte thirst ofthe even tjhe least discerning genre fan
. tghe film isnt at frist conserned wiht a gropu ofthe roaming vampire slayers
, led by james woods
, ofthe all peple
. liek soem sort ofthe wholy a
- team
( htey even ahve theri pwn souped
- uv van
)
, tje bunch invade adn wipe outloud a nest ofthe vampires inthe a newyorker mexico shack
. theri method isnt amusingly inovative
: tjhe blood
- suckers are reeled outloud wtih harpoons so tehy cxan flare uv iin tyhe sun liek matchsticks
. tothe commerate thier victory
, thge loutish b
and decorates a motel room witht hookers anbd parties tjhe niht awya
. thier cellabration isnt short

, howver
, as a master vampire named valek ambushes annd single

andedly destroys most ofthe tjhe team
. woods
' jack crowm adn buddy montoya
( daniel baldwin
) excape withthe theri lives
, allong wih a woman named katrina
( sheryl lee
)
.
al
thought tje woman hasnt beeen bitten
, montoya adn crowm deside tothe keep katrina forthe her pyschic link tothe hte master vampire
. tje rest ofthe tyhe movei isnt conserned wiht tghe boys
' hunt fo valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
, a freaky marilyn manson
- tipe who
' s onthe a mission thast dates bcak 600 yersa
. allong thte way htey pik uv a priest named guiteau
( tim guinee
)
, a chracter who serves preety much yhe smae purpose as tjhe jittery cpl
. upham inspite
_ saveing private ryan
_
. smoe tsuff happens inaddition yhe middle ofthe tghe movei
, bu i cant
' t rember most ofthe it
, beccause i oftenly foudn a twitching hair inwhich yhe corner ofthe tyhe frome mroe intresting thna wqat wass hapening onthe screen
.
_ vampires
_ finaly starts tothe pik uv baout 90 mintues inot tghe mix
, as crowm
, guiteau
, adn montoya assfalt an a
andoned prision
- turned vampire nest
. onyl thne doens tghe film beign tothe even ressemble a carpentery flick
. bu it
' s too littel too lite
. we git tje inevitible fianl confrontation
, bu it seems tacked onthe anbd rether anti
- climactic
( come onthe
, we
' re dealing wih
_ tghe
_ master vampire here
!
) interestingly
, lsat summer
' s vampire actioner
_ blade
_ ws derivated fomr a comic book
, adn
_ vampires
_ fomr a novel
, yot thge latter seems mroe steeped iin campy cheesiness tahn thte fromer
, a omre deliberate superhero flick
. woods
' jack crowm spouts glib off

) at least
_ blade
_ hadnt decent acation adn slick stylishness
.
_ vampires
_ lacks even cheap thrills tothe mask its gossamer
- thin plot
. tothe mkea uv fo tihs
, hte movei resorts tothe otehr
" shocks
,
" such as its generaly condescending atitude towords womens
( crowm slaps them aroud fo tje funn ofthe it
) annd an overplayed contempt forthe religon
( crowm teases guiteau incessantly baout whther his vow ofthe celibacy hasnt made him prone tothe
" getting woodies
.
"
) it cant be argued tht mabey i wnated too much ffrom htis movei
. if nto csary anbd gory
, i wnated tense
, relentless
, annd exhausting
.
_ john carpentery
' s vampires
_ isnt none ofthe theese
. i cxan onyl recomended it forthe tjhe hardcore carpentery fan
. forthe tyhe rest ofthe yuo looking forthe a ogod scare
, beware
:
_ vampires
_ isnt a film wtih noone teeth
