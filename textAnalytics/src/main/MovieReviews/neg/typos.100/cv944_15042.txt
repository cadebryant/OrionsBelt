" it wass nto csary
.
" theese are thge frist words thyat cameback tothe mind affter it wass over
. whn a movei isnt called
_ vampires
_
,
" nto csary
" aren ' t words tath shoudl be asociated wiht it
.
bu thast wasn ' t my onyl gripe
. john carpentery isnt a nmae assoicated iwth cutting
- edge cinema
, as inwhich tghe intense scares ofthe
_ halloeen
_
,
_ thte thnig
_
adn
_ hte prince ofthe darkness
_
, or thte offbeat acation ofthe
_ htey live
_
anbd
_ excape ffrom newyorker york
_
. unfortunatley
, thge onyl thign tyhat isnt cutting edge baout
_ vampires
_ isnt hte levle ofthe boredom tghe movei isnt able tothe triarch
. wih an anemic plot
adn nto
- qtuie
- kosher speical effects
,
_ john carpentery ' s vampires
_ hasnt bearly anough substace tothe slake tghe thirst ofthe even tjhe least discerning genre fan
. teh film isnt at firt conserned wih a gropu ofthe roaming vampire slayers
, led by james woods
, ofthe all peopel
. liuke soem sort ofthe wholy a
- team
( htey even hvae theri pwn souped
- uv van
)
, thte bunch invade
anbd wipe outloud a nest ofthe vampires iin a newyorker mexico shack
. thier method isnt amusingly inovative
: yhe blood
- suckers are reeled outloud wtih harpoons so tehy cin flare uv inaddition tjhe sun liek matchsticks
. tothe comemmorate theri victory
, tghe loutish band decorates a motel room whith hookers
annd parties tghe nigth awya
. thier celebratuin isnt short
- lieved
,
howver
, as a master vampire named valek ambushes
adn single
- handedly destroys most ofthe yhe team
. woods ' jack crowm
annd buddy montoya
( daniel baldwin
) excape whith theri lives
, allong wih a woman named katrina
( sheryl lee
)
.
altough tyhe woman hasnt beeen bitten
, montoya
adn crowm deside tothe keep katrina fo her psyhic link tothe yhe master vampire
. tjhe rest ofthe teh movei isnt conserned wtih teh boys ' hunt forthe valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
, a freaky marilyn manson
- tipe who ' s onthe a mission thast dates bcak 600 eyasr
. allong teh way htey pik uv a priest named guiteau
( tim guinee
)
, a charactor who serves preety much teh smae purpose as thge jittery cpl
. upham iin
_ saveing private ryan
_
. soem stfuf happens inthe tjhe middle ofthe tghe movei
,
bu i cant ' t rember most ofthe it
, becuase i oftenly foudn a twitching hair infact thte corner ofthe tyhe frome moreso intresting thna wqat ws hapening onthe screen
.
_ vampires
_ fianlly starts tothe pik uv baout 90 mintues inot hte mix
, as crowm
, guiteau
,
adn montoya assualt an abandnoed prision
- turned vampire nest
. onyl
thn doesnt thge film beign tothe even ressemble a carpentery flick
.
bu it ' s too littel too lite
. we git tyhe inevatible fianl confrontation
,
bu it seems tacked onthe
annd rether anti
- climactic
( cmo onthe
, we ' re dealing wih
_ thge
_ master vampire here
!
) interestingly
, lsat summer ' s vampire actioner
_ blade
_ ws drived ffrom a comic book
,
annd
_ vampires
_ ffrom a novel
,
yot tje latter seems mroe steeped infact campy cheesiness thna tjhe fromer
, a moreso deliberate superhero flick
. woods ' jack crowm spouts glib off
- tghe
- cuff oney
- liners
annd strolls awya ffrom exploding buildings wih thyat oh
- so
- kool stride
.
adn his motive forthe killing vampires
? tkae a wild guess
.
( hint
: a
_
_
_
_
_
_ killed his
_
_
_
_
_ whn he wass jsut a
_
_
_
_
_
.
) at least
_ blade
_ hadnt decent acation
annd slick stylishness
.
_ vampires
_ lacks even cheap thrills tothe mask its gossamer
- thin plot
. tothe mkea uv forthe tihs
, tyhe movei resorts tothe otehr
" shocks
,
" such as its generaly condescending attitide towords womens
( crowm slaps them aroud forthe thte funn ofthe it
)
annd an overplayed contempt forthe religon
( crowm teases guiteau incessantly baout whther his vow ofthe celibacy hasnt made him prone tothe
" getting woodies
.
"
) it cxan be argued thyat mabey i wnated too much fomr thsi movei
. if nto scry
anbd gory
, i wnated tense
, relentless
,
annd exhausting
.
_ john carpentery ' s vampires
_ isnt none ofthe theese
. i cant onyl reccommended it forthe yhe hardcore carpentery fan
. fo yhe rest ofthe yuo looking forthe a ogod scare
, beware
:
_ vampires
_ isnt a film withthe noone teeth
.
