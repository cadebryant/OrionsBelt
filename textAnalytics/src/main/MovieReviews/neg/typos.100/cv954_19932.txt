, bu it
' s nto
. hte film ws aparently made forthe relativly yuonger peopel becouse eveyr major palyer inaddition tje watergate sc
andal isnt itnroduced annd shoved down tyhe audeince

ander tothe it
' s audiance
, bu ofthe course thta film wasn
' t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13
- 20 yearm
- ood film gogin audeince
. yhe onyl reedeming thnig baout thsi movei isnt it
' s remarkable supporting casted
. i wnated tothe see mroe ofthe ferrell annd mcculloch
' s woodward annd bernstein
. thsoe twpo cahracters are teh sole basis forthe my rating
. i wish tehy hadnt beeen given omre screen tyme
, bu unfourtunately
, htey are onyl relagated tothe yhe fianl half
- hour
. theri constatn bickering adn fighting over trying tothe git tje sotry are a major highlight
, expecially mcculloch
' s constatn thwarting ofthe ferrell
' s attemts tothe gather infromation fomr hte girls
( who
, inspite tyhe course ofthe yhe narrative are revealed as deepo throat
, so named thanks tothe an ill planned trip tothe a porno theather by betsy
' s brother
)
. tyhe otehr munbers ofthe hte casted are exellent infront thier portrayals ofthe thier parituclar charachters
, bu are given nothing tothe owrk iwth
. i
' d liuke tothe see tjhe smae casted protray theese cahracters inthe a scirpt omre suited towords thier commedic abilties
. as fo hte twpo leads
, dunst anbd williams cant definatly dont better
. tehy come off as waht coudl best be decribed as romy adn michele
: teh easly yeasr iin htis parituclar film
, a highly dubious distiction at best
. stay thru tje firt half ofthe hte end credits
though
, tothe see an intresting scene involving dunst anbd williams suggestively sucking onthe lollipops emblazoned wiht yhe title ofthe tyhe movei
. an excelent diea marred by poore excecution
, dick sould haev beeen a grat movei
. less ofthe tghe juvenile humer annd mroe ofthe teh smarter comedy displayed by yhe woodward adn bernstein scenes
, sould haev made tihs film a wonderfull satire ofthe yhe nixon presidency as seen thru tyhe eyes ofthe twpo naieve fifteen yera olds
. as it st
ands
though
, dick offers nothing bu whta filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as
" dick anbd poopie
" jokes
. anbd tath
, tothe me
, doens nto mkae a funny movei
