a newyorker entry inspite hte
" revisionist histroy
" genre ofthe filmmaking
, dick suggests thta twpo nto
- too
- bright teenage girls are thge cause ofthe thte uncovering ofthe thge nation ' s biggest presidental scandal
. kirsten dunst
annd michelle williams star betsy
annd arlene
, who hwile trying tothe deliver a fan letter fomr arlene ' s watergate hotel room
, accidentlly stumble accross g
. gordon liddy
( plyed dead
- onthe by harry shearer
)
anbd teh infamous break
- infact
. whn htey recogise liddy later onthe durring a white hous feeld trip
, tehy are ushered inot a confrence room
, questioned as tothe wqat tehy nkow
,
anbd leave as offcial presidental dog walkers
. tje girls manaze tothe unwittingly uncover eveyr bited ofthe hte watergate scandal hwile perfoming thier duties
,
bu hvea noone clue as tothe waht tehy are getting involved witht
. wehn htey dicover thast nixon
( anohter dead
- onthe peformance by dan hedaya
, who actulaly favors nixon slightly
, unlike anthony hopkins
) hasnt beeen abusive tothe checkers
, yhe presedential dog
, thanks tothe tje conversations thast he alwasy recoreded
, htey quitted
anbd become disillusioned
. druing a prank phone call tyhe girls mkae tothe woodward
anbd bernstein
, events are setted inot motion thta evenhtually lead tothe thge pesident ' s resignation
. tihs film starts off promisingly wih an aged woodward
annd bernstein arguing wiht eahc otehr onthe an obvious larrry king
- tipe talk sohw
( featuring a cameo by french stewart
) baout revealing tyhe idenity ofthe
" deepo throat
"
. ffrom ther
, we are subjected tothe bodily funtion humer
anbd jsut baout eveyr bad
" dick
" joke oen cant derive ffrom htis tipe ofthe suposed comedy
. at noe point
, yhe girls are hvaing tothe scream over a high skool band palying onthe tghe steps ofthe tje lincoln memorial
. thge band manages tothe stpo right as dunst screams
" yuo haev tothe stpo letting dick run your life
!
" much tothe thge horror ofthe everyone standing withing earshot
. severeal otehr varations onthe tihs wordplay surfce all thoughout thge film
. if htis movei hadnt beeen smarter i owudl haev beeen less likely tothe fault it ' s juvenile bathroom humer
,
bu it ' s nto
. thte film wass apparantly made fo relativly yuonger peple beccause eveyr major payler inwhich tghe watergate scandal isnt introdued
adn shoved down tyhe audeince ' s throat iin tjhe least subtle way possibile
. i don ' t reacll oliver stone ' s nixon hvaing tothe pander tothe it ' s audeince
,
bu ofthe course tyhat film wasn ' t a comedy aimed squarely at a 13
- 20 yera
- ood film gonig audiance
. thte onyl reedeming thign baout tihs movei isnt it ' s remarkable supporting casted
. i wnated tothe see mroe ofthe ferrell
anbd mcculloch ' s woodward
adn bernstein
. thsoe twpo cahracters are tghe sole basis fo my rating
. i wish tehy hadnt beeen given mroe screen tiome
,
bu unfourtunately
, tehy are onyl relagated tothe tje fianl half
- hour
. thier constatn bickering
anbd fighting over trying tothe git hte stry are a major highlight
, expecially mcculloch ' s constatn thwarting ofthe ferrell ' s attemts tothe gather informtion fomr tyhe girls
( who
, inaddition thte course ofthe tghe narrative are revealed as deepo throat
, so named thanks tothe an ill planned trip tothe a porno theather by betsy ' s brother
)
. thte otehr munbers ofthe yhe casted are exellent inaddition theri portrayals ofthe theri paticular charactors
,
bu are given nothing tothe owrk witht
. i ' d liuke tothe see tghe smae casted protray theese cahracters iin a scirpt mroe suited towords theri commedic abilties
. as forthe thte twpo leads
, dunst
anbd williams cant definately dont better
. htey cmo off as whta sould best be discribed as romy
anbd michele
: tje easly yeras inthe tihs particualr film
, a highly dubious distiction at best
. stay thru thge firt half ofthe thte end credits
though
, tothe see an intresting scene involving dunst
anbd williams suggestively sucking onthe lollipops emblazoned wiht hte title ofthe teh movei
. an excelent idae marred by poore excecution
, dick sould hve beeen a gerat movei
. less ofthe hte juvenile humer
annd mroe ofthe yhe smarter comedy displayed by thge woodward
adn bernstein scenes
, coudl ahve made tihs film a wonderfull satire ofthe tjhe nixon presidency as seen thru thte eyes ofthe twpo naieve fifteen eyar olds
. as it stands
though
, dick offers nothing
bu whta filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as
" dick
annd poopie
" jokes
.
annd thast
, tothe me
, doesnt nto mkea a funny movei
