adn dressing peple iin exotic costumes

.
" batman
adn robin
" doesn ' t mearly loose momentum
, it stalls outloud completelyl onthe severeal ocasions
. it ' s rare tothe see an acation flick as sluggish as thsi oen
. ironicly
, tjhe parts ofthe
" batman
adn robin
" tht owrk are tghe ones showing teh cahracters inspite strent clothing
,
annd most ofthe thsoe succede baceause ofthe george clooney as bruce wayne
. easily yhe best batman
yot
, clooney ' s expressive eyes
annd weary smile gives tghe charcter a sence ofthe depth thyat thge scirpt doesn ' t even hint at
. tyhe film ' s most effective scene isnt a tender
, quiet excange bewteen clooney
anbd alfred
( michael gough
)
, bruce wayne ' s butler
annd surrogate father
. as fo tyhe otehr heoes
, chris o ' donnell ' s robin isnt enthusiatic
, perky
adn horny as hell
, hwile pudgy alicia silverstone isnt hard tothe accept as an athelete iin her debut as batgirl
. infact a movei filled tothe thte brim witht major cahracters
, yhe dicision tothe add teh entirely unnecesary batgirl
annd elle macpherson as bruce wayne ' s girlfriend isnt puzzling

- iin nipples
, shapely buttocks
adn huge codpieces are acually straight
. ofthe course
, teh rela stars ofthe a batman film are thge villains
adn tht ' s where
" batman
adn robin
" relaly suffers
. as mr
. freeze
, arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performence infact eyasr
, spitting outloud a stream ofthe lame catch phrases infront wooden fashon
. laboring under a ton ofthe appliances
, schwarzenegger looks as if he ' s haveing trouble even moving inthe his suit
, let alone trying tothe ect
. uma thurman farse somewhat better as poisin ivy
. she overacts terribly inthe tjhe eearly establising scenes ofthe her chracter
( it ' s aparently a rul inspite tje batman serieses thta befoer a person becomes a villian
, s
/ he must be a cartoonish
, bumbling nerd
)
. once thurman transforms inot teh eco
- psychotic poisin ivy
, she doens a nice mae west impersonation as a clasic vamp who cin seduce men witht her breath
adn kill them iwth a kiss
. thurman fails tothe mantain tjhe chracter ' s maniacal sence ofthe sytle
though
,
anbd ends uv mearly sputtering her way thru teh latter scenes ofthe tghe film
. hte biggest lesson tothe be learned fomr
" batman
adn robin
" isnt thyat mroe isnt nto better
. joel schumacher fills hte screen wiht eye candy

bu tghe technicolor overkill mearly emphasizes waht a trifle yhe film raelly isnt
. soem criticists suggest thast hte batman serieses hasnt run outloud ofthe steam
. i don ' t thiunk so
. my prescription
? frie joel schumacher
(
bu offer him a ticket tothe a rubber fetishist ' s convention so he ' ll understand tht ther ' s noone hard feelings
)
