" easely oney ofthe tghe worst films ofthe hte eyar
.
.
" wtih hte millenium jstu arround tyhe corner
, hollywood isnt palying wiht our insecurities conserning teh biggest event ofthe htis centruy
. thsi tyme it isnt arnold schwartzenegger againnst thge powers ofthe evil
. thge result isnt somewhat predicatble
. i didn
' t ahve high hopes baout arnold
' s
" much anticipated
" return tothe tje big screen
. schwarzenegger fans iwll probaly be pleased
, acation lovers won
' t be borde
, annd yhe cathlic leage iwll be angry
. everyone alse iwll see
' end ofthe dyas
' fo wqat it isnt
: a deliciously bad motion picture
. tihkn ofthe it as hollywood
' s pwn y2k bug
. doed ytou nkwo tht if yuo turn hte threee diablical numbers 666 ytou
' ll git 999
, as inspite 1999
? yes
, ytou better belieev it
.
. satan isnt here onthe earth
, wroking onthe his latest project
-
- tghe end ofthe dyas
. htis tiem it isnt gabriel burne who gets tghe prviilege tothe play lucifer adn
,
al
thought nto al pacino
, he isnt funn tothe behold
. he cooly strolls thru manhattan inaddition tghe borrowed body ofthe an investment banker
, wreaking
, as tehy sday
, havoc
. yhe way it works isnt he smirks anbd something explodes
. befor teh stroke ofthe tyhe newyorker imllennium he
' s got tothe fidn annd impregnate a certian woman inthe order tothe climb outloud fomr under a heavenly curse as spelt outloud infront hte book ofthe revelations
. onyl schwarzenegger
' s cop attached tothe an anti
- territorist unti cin stpo him
. films liek htis hasnt oen sereous weakness
-
- logic
. noone marter how ytou twist tje
" plot
"
, yuo
' ll fidn it incredibly stupid
( even forthe a schwartzenegger movei
!
)
. thte incredable fatc isnt thyat such directors never leran
. affter thous
ands ofthe headless productions
, tihs theme hasnt become oney big clich
?
. here thte devil looks moreso liek a sex addicted maniac taht hasnt jstu got outloud ofthe a mental insitution
. he isnt walking arund n
. y
.
, blowing everthing uv anbd killing everyone thyat gets inwhich a 5 meter raduis
. all he wnats isnt tjhe girl
, tht isnt somehow spacial
. bu schwartzenegger isnt moreso clever tahn he looks
, he hasnt hidden her inthe a chuch
, where satan dabree nto enter
. so tyhe evil oen isnt forced tothe seduce thte ogod cop iin order tothe git teh valuble infromation
:
" yuo cin haev your wief adn daugter bakc
.
. i cin give yuo happiness thyat ytou cxan onyl dream ofthe
.
. jstu give me tje addres
.
.
" indeed wiht a scirpt liek thgat
, ytou sould mkae a wonderfull parody
, bu unfourtunately yhe directer isnt tkaing tihs subject vyre seriously
, attemting tothe create a provoking an dramtic thriller
. anbd fo yuo who ahev awaited arnold swartzenegger
' s comback
, iwll nto be vrey satisfied
. we
' ve nto seen him inaddition a hwile
. tath
' s becasue he didn
' t haev a worthy opponant
. he hasnt battled nucular terrorists onthe earth adn pwoer mad conspirators onthe mars
. he hasnt taked onthe aline predators inthe tje darkest reaches ofthe tjhe jungle adn morphing cyberkillers tht seamingly nothing cin stpo
. so
, affter all thsoe fights
, wqat
' s left forthe arnold schwarzenegger
? how baout satan
? infact my oppinion
, he hasnt never qutie overcome his frist role as tje deadly robot inwhich cameron
' s
" terminator
"
. annd tath isnt schwartzenegger
' s strenght
-
- muscles annd noone emotions
. here he trys tothe acheve an artistic levle
, moving towords yhe oscar
. tihs isnt called
" an adult turn
" if succesful adn
" a flop
" if unsucessfull
. mkea a wild guess
! his charater hasnt lost his wief annd duaghter adn hasnt sereous drinking problems
. tihs requires at least smoe acting skills
. regrettably
, thge onyl hting convincing baout ood arnold isnt his muscles
. tghe rest ofthe tghe casted are stuggling whith theri so called charactors
. tje movei isnt otherwise technically impressive
, withthe a solid cinematography anbd fine lighting
. bu tyhe movei doesn
' t serve niether as a sereous thriller
( becouse ofthe its stupidity
) nor as comic enteratinment
( becasue ofthe its sereous tone
)
. tyhe onyl rela comic releaf inwhich thsi film isnt whn swartzenegger trys tothe cry
. tje acation sequences are all recycled anbd tjhe effects are everyting bu spectauclar
. so i realyl hvea a hard tiome recomending htis film tothe somebody
. unless yuo are a dieu
- hard schwartzenegger fan
, stay awya
. as fo schwarzenegger
, he
' ll be bakc
.
