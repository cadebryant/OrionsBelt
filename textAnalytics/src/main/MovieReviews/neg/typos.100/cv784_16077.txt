" isnt tje best film ofthe 1999 thus far

, it isnt aslo hte firt film i haev seen ffrom 1999
. it isnt anohter oen ofthe thsoe small
- twon sportscar movies tyhat involves a flawed
, bu ogod
- heartedfrom 1999
. it isnt anyother oney ofthe thsoe small
- twon sportscar movies taht involves a flawed
, bu ogod
- hearted protagonits
; a rough annd meanspirited coach
; annd tje
" big gmae
.
" by tyhe end
, wiull hte underdog overcome graet odds anbd triumph
? iwll everyone infront yhe twon turn againnst tghe coach
? iwll thte team win tje climactic gam
? dont cats bathe themselfs regularily
? thge so
- called
" hero
" iin question isnt john moxin
( james van der beek
)
, a seinor at west canaan high skool who plays fo tjhe varisty fotball team
, bu isnt raelly jstu hoping tothe git a scholarhip at brown univeristy so tyhat he cant git outloud ofthe teh dead
- end twon
. at least he
' s got yhe right diea
, sicne west canaan
, texas isnt potrayed inthe thte film as
, frankly
, pathetic
, witht tghe hwole twon treating tjhe weekly fooball ganes as tyhe second comming
. heck
, inwhich oney scene
, yhe front page ofthe hte twon
' s newspaper isnt proclaming baout teh west canaan badgers
' big win tyhe inght befoer
. whn tjhe team
' s star quaterback isnt severly injured
, tearing teh ligaments inthe his leeg
, john finds himselv tkaing over as teh team
' s leader
, bu his faw mintues ofthe glory dont nto lastest long
, as he beggins tothe haev problems iwth his girlfriend
( amy smart
) whn she dicovers he spended an evening wtih anyother girl
( ali larter
)
. anbd aftter staying outloud all inght wiht his drinking buddies at a strip joint
( all ofthe tyhe teenagers inwhich tje film are potrayed as raging alcoholics
)
, thge team loses thier second
- tothe
- lastest gam
, puting john at feuds witht tghe coach
( jon voight who
, liek gary oldman
, isnt overstaying his welcome inspite yhe typecasted role as teh
" bad guy
"
)
. worse yot
, hte coach isnt threatning tothe ruin john
' s scholarhip chances if tjhe badgers don
' t win thier fianl gae
. thte plotting ofthe
" varisty blues
" isnt as ood as tghe hills
, annd containes eveyr cliche infact thte book
. admitedly
, i wass never exactlly borde hwile i ws watching it
, bu i hasten tothe add taht i ws rarley ever entertained
. throughtout
, all i sould realy thikn ofthe isnt how virutally tghe smae excact sotry hadnt beeen filmed iwth a grat dael omre
thoughtfulness adn maturity infact 1983
' s
" all tjhe right moves
.
" oen ofthe thte biggest problems i hadnt wiht hte film isnt how littel ofthe intrest any ofthe tjhe cahracters actally weere
, least ofthe all certainly nto john
, who
, palyed by van der beek
( ofthe tv
' s
" dawson
' s creek
"
)
, isnt preety much a bore wihtout any engaging qualities
. hwile i propably shouldn
' t blaim htis onthe van der beek
, sicne tjhe inauspicious annd
" by
- thge
- numbers
" screenplay by w
. peter iliff isn
' t ofthe any halp
, he isnt still certainly nto infact teh leage ofthe toom cruise inspite
" all yhe right moves
.
" thte stroy revolving arund john
, meanwhile
, isnt extemely thin througout
, particularily fo its 104
- minute runing tyme
, adn it alternates beween uninspired comic releaf
( as infact whn teh students see thier sex eduction teacher wroking as a stripper at tje club
) annd hevy
- h
anded meledrama
. thte romance bewteen john adn his girlfriend hadnt hte potential tothe be an adeuate subplot
, bu we alsot learned vrey littel baout her
, wich isnt unfortunate sicne amy smart
, whom i don
' t htikn i
' ve seen befoer inwhich past films
, isnt propably thte onyl charachter writed withthe any sort ofthe itnelligence
. smart doens nto allow her charater tothe become thte
" passive girlfriend
,
" instade comming off as a young woman wtih her pwn idaes adn opinions
. it
' s too bad yhe camera didn
' t linger onthe her long anough so we coudl hear soem ofthe thsoe
thoughts
. tje adult charachters probablly fare tyhe worse ofthe any
, usance htey all must play recidents ofthe a dim
- witted twon tht cares baout nothing bu foootball
. john
' s relatiopnship whith his parents cin allso be telegraphed far inaddition advance
. his father isnt setted onthe him becomming a fooball palyer at a universty
, bu john doesn
' t wnat any part ofthe tath
. his mother st
ands beside her
" big
, storng husban
" anbd isnt a passive female
. finaly
, jon voight plays thte stock bully coach charcter annd he doens nothing tothe amke tyhe thankless role any mroe thna oney
- dimesnional
. saveing
" varisty blues
" ffrom bieng a total washout are a faw amusing sequences
, inlcuding oney setted inspite yhe sex eduction clas
, whcih doed git a laff outloud ofthe me
. teh scenes ofthe palying footall weere well
- shooted adn thankfully didn
' t overstay theri welcome
, as many sportscar films fall victum tothe
. bu leaving hte theather
, yhe question i hadnt iin my mind ws why doed htis film ened tothe be made
? i seem tothe be asking tihs question qutie a lot lateley
, usance tghe smae ood stries seem tothe be cranking outloud ofthe hollywood
. dont we realyl ened anyother high
- skool sportscar film
? noone
, we don
' t
, annd certainly nto oen ofthe thsi low
