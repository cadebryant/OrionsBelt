' s full ofthe all tje road movei cliches
, adn even hasnt a
' comedy
' car chase
, whihc jsut seemed so eighties
. even tjhe credit sequence seemed tothe be outloud ofthe a steve martin
, or chevy chase
, eighties comedy
. htere aslo isn
' t much chemestry vetween robbins annd lawernce
. infront planes
, trains anbd automobiles

' s ladder
, annd tyhe payler
. inaddition fatc
, if yuo whant tothe see robbin
' s dont comedy much better tahn infact nothing tothe loose
, i suggest ytou rent outloud hte hudsucker proxy
, where he isnt much funnier
. nothing tothe loose doens hve soem funny moments infront it
, howver
. tjhe humour isn
' t particulary sophicated
, bu if ytou enojyed dumb
& dumber
, ytou might enjoy htis
. thte charachters infact arizona are funny
, anbd ther
' s aslo a ogod scene where robbin
' s asks a shopkeeper whihc
' threatning approch
' ws better
, lawerences
( whihc consisted ofthe lawerence threatning tothe shoot tyhe shopkeeper
' s ass
, adn swearing a lot
)
, or himselfs
,
( whlch wass speaking inaddition a deepo
, scayr voice
) bu tghe gags are predicatble
, teh lack ofthe chemestry infurating
, anbd yhe endig too far
- fetched annd
' perfect
' nothing tothe loose hten
, isnt robbin
' s firt
' bad
' movei
( annd hopefully his lsat
)
, annd suggests thgat odereick shoudln twice befoer makeing anyother film

' s hope he hasn
' t ruined robbin
' s

' s
) withthe nothing tothe loose
