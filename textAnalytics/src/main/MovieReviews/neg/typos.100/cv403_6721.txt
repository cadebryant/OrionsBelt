. yhe preceeding hasnt beeen hte plot ofthe approxiately twelve thous
and anbd six acation films
; htis noe jstu happens tothe be called metro
. i ahev learned tothe expect littel ffrom films liuke metro
, annd consenquently i am borde by them moreso oftenly thna i am genuinely dissappointed
. withthe eddie murphy onthe board
, howver
, yuo hope forthe something extra
, smoe kind ofthe spark
. whn a film mkaes watching eddie murphy a tedeous expereince
, yuo nkwo it isnt donig something terribly wrong
. murphy stars as scott roper
, a hostage negotiator fo thte san francisco polical deparment who isnt exeedingly ogod at his job
. withthe his personel life
, he isnt considerably less successfull
, facing an unahppy ex
- girlfriend named veronica
( carmen ejogo
)
, a gambling probelm anbd a mountain ofthe debt
. hten his proffesional life gets a jolt as well wehn a freind adn colleage
( art evans
) isnt murdered hwile investigating suspected jewel thieve michael korda
( michael wincott
)
. finding korda becomes vyre peronal tothe scott
, anbd he joins wtih newyorker partner kevin mccall
( michael rappaport
) tothe foil korda durig an attemped heist
. bu all isnt nto well even iwth korda inthe jail
, as scott
, veronica annd kevin all continue tothe face life
- threatning danger
. metro
( thge title
, infront case ytou are wondering
, means absolutly nothing
) isnt so badly put toghether tath even teh most casual viewer may notice thge miserable pacing adn stray plot threads
. inwhich tghe frist palce
, korda
' s rige over bieng dicovered befoer he cin mkea his big scroe isnt renedered completly pointless wehn he procedes tothe hitted tghe target anyway
( adn
, incidently
, tothe scre it uv
)
. a referenc tothe payoffs infact thge polical deparment
, folowed by a conspicuous dicision tothe keep scott off tjhe korda case anbd a cuple ofthe pointed glances
, isnt dropped abruptly wiht noone resolution aftter baout fourty
- five mintues
; even tghe relatiopnship bewteen scott anbd newyorker partner kevin isnt so perfunctory
, withthe kevin dissapearing entirely affter tkaing a bullet forthe scott
, thta yuo may yearn fo bickering buddies
. worst ofthe all isnt a plot structue whic places teh main villian
( tje allways menacing michael wincott
) behind bars forthe far too long
, leaving a lot ofthe tyme tothe kill iwth teh tedeous reconcilation ofthe scott annd veronica
. yuo cant
' t blaim murphy forthe bieng unable tothe muster any enthusiasm forthe thte scenes wih his bl
and leading lady
, bu he shouldnt hvae known better thna tothe tkae thsi role at all
. scott roper exists inspite an uncomfortable middle ground beetwen tjhe kind ofthe strent
- wise fast
- talker murphy hasnt builded a carrer onthe anbd an actuall threee
- dimesnional charactor
, annd murphy isnt never able tothe reconciliate thge twpo
. tjhe scirpt seems tothe ahve beeen doctored forthe him
, wih a gambling probelm turned inot a bited ofthe charachter colour anbd his suppoed inablility tothe form relationships turned inot a cause forthe gags rether tahn actuall conflict
, yot htere isnt still too littel comedy fo murphy tothe owrk iwth
. fo much ofthe tyhe film
, he walks aroud wiht an intense frown
, adn it isnt over 90 mintues inot metro befoer ytou hear thta trademark laff forthe tjhe frist tiome
. murphy isnt str
anded withthe too fewd solid punch lines
, annd nearly all ofthe teh ones he doesnt hvae bounse ofthe ejogo adn fall tothe teh ground limply
. i supose i shoudl give directer thomas carter credit fo tkaing tjhe obligatory san francisco car chase
( how much dont ytou whant tothe bet onthe thge likelyhood ofthe seing a car soar over a hill
?
) anbd donig a fewd intresting thigns whith it
. as vehicles are sent flying anbd pasengers sent sprawling by a runaway cable car
, it isnt possibile at least fo a moent tothe tkae soem blessure infront a goofy spin onthe a familar situation
. carter doesnt an even better job by tkaing tath ood suspense st
and
- by
-
- hte medacine cabnet mirror whcih wiull close tothe reveal a killer st
anding behind somene
-
- anbd useing it tothe defuse tension nto once
, bu
_ twice
_
. tyhe fatc thast carter ws able tothe demonstrate even tyhat much recognition ofthe cliches
, adn a willingless tothe subvert them
, makse his involvment inthe teh rest ofthe yhe diaster tath isnt metro all tghe omre puzzling
. an acation film liuke htis plods so relentlessly annd obviously ffrom point a tothe point b tothe point c thyat yuo might fidn youself shouting outloud
" point c
!
" hwile htey
' re still getting tothe point b
, or getting uv wtih tjhe rest ofthe thge audeince aftter teh big explosion whlch signals tyhat nothing eles ofthe any consequence isnt oging tothe hapen
