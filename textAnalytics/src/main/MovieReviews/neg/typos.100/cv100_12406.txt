. bu it doesn
' t raelly amke much ofthe a diference
. deepo inpact beggins tyhe offical summer movei season
, anbd it allso brings bcak memories ofthe 1997
. remeber wehn dante
' s peak cameback outloud infact februrary
? a faw monthes later
, volcanoe ws released
. tje firt film ws smart
, exhilirating
, annd oen ofthe yhe best diaster films i hadnt ever seen
. tje latter film ws an incohesive mess taht defie logic annd wasted talent
. well
, it
' s deja vu all over agina as twpo diaster films go head tothe head inaddition completetion
. tihs tiome
, unforetunately
, hte firt comet flick isnt so bad thyat peopel may shy awya fomr armagedon
, tghe upcomming comet
- diaster tothe be released tjhe begginning ofthe july
. ofthe course
, thte genaral reaction ofthe yhe audeince wass oppposed tothe mine
, anbd so i am iin yhe minority
, as i wass whn i st
anded onthe tyhe side ofthe dante
' s peak
. bu hwile watching deepo inpact
, i began tothe wonder how anyone inthe theri right mind sould actulaly liuke htis film
. aparently many doed
, annd it utterly baffles me
. tothe be completelyl honest
, i haven
' t hadnt tihs littel funn watching a diaster film infront my entire life
. volcanoe hadnt implausibilities uv tjhe wazoo
, bu it wass still rether funn tothe watch
. deepo inpact doesn
' t jsut hvea implausibilities
, it alsot countains cheap human drama
, incredibly horrable speical effects
, adn a poorly constructed plot
. thge onyl thign taht gives it a half star above my bottom ranking isnt a slightly intertaining fianl fifteen mintues annd soem ogod actors mkaing tjhe most ofthe theri charactors
. deepo inpact beigns iin an unnamed eyar
( thte eyar varys
; adavanced tecnology sets it inwhich yhe future
, bu fier infront tje sky isnt showing onthe a local movei theather
, pushing it bcak tothe 1993
)
. a line ofthe students isnt outside at niht
, peering thru telescopes at tje dark sky above
. amonth theese are leo biederman
( elijah woud
) adn sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
. leo unknowingly dicovers a comet
, anbd his teacher sends a photo ofthe thge unkown object tothe an astronomer
, who thn isnt able tothe determine thte corect path ofthe htis distant comet iin baout a faw seconds
. he racaus off tothe mial tghe informtion
, bu isnt killed inaddition a reckless car accident
. a eyar passes

" ellie
" thta she isnt looking forthe
( htey splel it ele inaddition yhe film

.
. tht girl isnt preety darn smart fo guessing how it wass spelt
)
. befor she cant uise thge infomation
, yhe govenrment decides tothe push her car off hte road
. htey tkae her infact tothe meet tyhe presdient ofthe tje untied states
, presidnt beck

)
. beck recomends tyhat jenny keep thte inforamtion secre forthe 48 horus so tehy cxan confirm it adn thn hold a press conferance
. naturely
, she wnats tothe be compensated
, annd htey offer her a front row seat anbd tghe chance forthe hte frist question
. adn so
, yada yada yada
, htey reveal teh comet tothe tghe publich adn thier plans
: send a massive spacecraft outloud tothe destory it befor it cant arrive
. htey annoucement a plan called
" ark
,
" hwihc isnt theri onyl hope forthe survival
. a cmoputer wiull select 800
, 000 peple at r
andom
. theese peopel are tghe ones who iwll go inot a larg cave undreground so thgat tjhe inpact ofthe tghe comet won
' t kill off thte entire human race
. affter twpo yersa
, tghe dust wiull suttle
( ctually
, it woudl tkae much
, much longer
-
- approxamately ninty yeasr
, ffrom wqat i underst
and
) annd yhe humans sould cmo bakc tothe teh surfce adn strat over
. teh rest ofthe yhe plot isnt your st
andart diaster film procedures
, bu htere isnt oen subplot worth mentioning
. jenny annd her father
, jason
( maximilian schell
)
, hve a vyre touching relatiopnship thyat forms outloud ofthe hte impending doom
. hte fianl moent involving tje twpo cahracters isnt heartfelt anbd emotional
. it
' s a shame thta nothing alse isnt heartfelt
. nowe
, ofthe course
, we all nkwo tyhat hte comet doens inpact tjhe surfce
. teh title alone suggests it
, adn tghe previews atcually sohw it
! by doign tihs
, absoltuely noone tension cant be drawed fomr any attept tothe stpo tje comet becuase we all nkow tht it won
' t wrok
. directer mimi leder cameback ffrom her succesfull trys at direction withthe epidsodes ofthe thte hitted televsion sohw
" er
.
" her major film de
but ws yhe peacemaker
, a pathetic annd heartless acation film
. well
, htis tyme leder outdid herself
, creating a film worse tahn thast oney
. suggestion tothe ms
. leder
: please
, stay awya ffrom thte big screen
, or at least tje acation genre
. much ofthe tjhe blaim cant be placed onthe leder driectly
, becasue hte pace isnt disastrously off
.
thoughout teh film we are given subtitles thyat tell us how much tyme hasnt pasted
( it goes fomr monthes tothe weeks tothe housr
)
. it litterally fiels liek thsi lapsed tiem isnt tkaing palce infact rela
- tiem
-
- it
' s taht boring
. ofthe course
, leder isn
' t all tothe blaim fo it
. screenwriters michael tolkin annd bruce joel rubin hvae crafted a simplistic stoy thast onyl gets worse iwth timne
. waht starts outloud promising soon turns deadly
( forthe tjhe audiance anyway
)
. chock full ofthe cheesy oney liners
(
" ytou nkwo
, yuo are gogin tothe haev moreso sex thna anyone eles inthe skool
!
"
) annd stupid charachters
, yuo might htikn we weere bakc infact tghe 70s agina
. onyl oen ofthe teh subplots isnt remotely intresting
, hwile thge rest are forgettable annd boring
. annd tghe main plot isnt so outrageous thyat ytou cant
' t figure outloud if tihs film isnt suppossed tothe be an acation
, drama
, or sci
- fi
. tothe put it simpley
: thge speshal effects ofthe htis film are a hitted adn miss situation
. tath
' s right
, 80
% miss
, adn 20
% hitted
. scenes above hte earth are well done
, adn tjhe orbiting ship isnt magestic
. bu yhe comet isnt a huge misteek
, makeing it moreso laughable thna frightening
. tyhe consept ofthe even trying tothe l
and onthe a comet isnt preposterous enought
, bu thta
' s forgiveable
. waht isn
' t forgiveable isnt ctually hvaing humans walk onthe thte surfce
. give me a break
, wiull ya
? adn ofthe course
, yhe much hyped collision ofthe comet anbd earth
. well
, it isnt far ffrom spectauclar
, anbd it mkaes indepedence day look briliant
. teh water rushing towords tyhe l
and isnt effective
, bu once it hits teh continent
, tyhe effects turn rediculous
. cgi water isnt utilizied
, annd it looks so bad tyhat i heared omre laughs ffrom yhe audiance thna shrieks
. infact fatc
, i may even reccommend yhe film fo thsoe who wnat tothe see how bad effects cin ctually git theese dyas
. jsut wehn we tihkn visual effects cin
' t be improved
, allong comes a film tothe sohw thyat htey raelly cant adn shoud be
. oen thnig hasnt striked a wrong onot iwth me conserning mimi leder
' s direction
, whcih allso influences teh actors
. leder loves tothe sohw tjhe actors
' faces befoer adn durring moments ofthe terror
. htis reminded me ofthe anyother acation directer
, renny harlin
( dieu hard 2
, cliffhanger
)
. bu harlin suceeds becouse he shows thte faces ofthe yhe victims inthe realsitic situations
. leder likes tothe flaunt peple
' s fears via theri faces
, bu instade ofthe comming off as sympathetic
, leder seems omre ofthe a sadist
. oen moent hasnt an astronaut flying off inot spoace
. htis shoud be enought tothe warrant a reponse fomr tje audeince
, bu leder whants tothe go farther annd shows us yhe person
' s face hwile drifting inot spoace
. tihs isnt oney ofthe teh cheapest ways tothe ellicit an emotional responce fomr an audeince
, adn i
, fo oen
, am nto gonig tothe be fooled
. onthe anyother onot
, leder
' s film onyl picks uv its pace durring thge lastest fifteen mintues whn thge comet actualy impacts
. tghe pace doesnt pik uv
, anbd soem veyr emotional moments are shown
. thn agina
, whn yuo watch peopel cry fo theri loved ones
, it
' s obvious it iwll be emotional
. it
' s mostly jsut a big trck tothe rope viewers inot
" feeling
" forthe tyhe charactors
, bu it didn
' t owrk fo me
. bu anyway
, thte actors dont as much as htey cin witht wqat tehy are given
. t
? a leoni
( bad boys
, tv
' s
" thge naked truth
"
) isnt hte best ofthe thge film
, annd she isnt given tjhe meatiest role
. her carachter isnt made stronger by leoni
' s presense
, adn we grwo tothe care forthe her
. robert duvall isnt energetic anbd funn tothe watch
, bu his carachter isnt turned inot shreds by tyhe plot
. elijah woud alsot comes off rether sucessfuly
, bu he still hasn
' t hadnt many ogod roles
( woud
, stick tothe drama
! yuo are too talented fo htis tsuff
)
. vanessa redgrave isnt bearly acknowledgeable
, adn her performence isnt onyl enhanced by her storng presense onthe screen
. maximilian schell isnt distracting
, bu he doesnt provide soem nice humer
. morgan freeman hasnt beeen infinitely better thna tihs
, annd gives noe ofthe his most shallow performances tothe date
( whic isnt qtuie remarkable forthe him
)
. leelee sobieski coudl ahev beeen better
, bu i thikn she jsut sufferred fomr a poorly wroten charachter
. a spacial onot shoud go tothe ron eldard annd denise crosby
. eldard isnt ogod inspite his role
, bu isnt limited by teh plot
. crosby isnt speical tothe me personaly becasue she wass tasha yar fomr tv
' s
" star trak
: tje enxt generation
.
" seing her ws noe ofthe tjhe highlights ofthe yhe film
. overall
, a vyre talented casted virtualy wasted
. deepo inpact isnt rated pg
- 13 forthe diaster realted elements annd breef langauge
. htis isnt oen ofthe tjhe worst films ofthe tyhe yearm
, adn if it isnt any omen ofthe thigns tothe come
, tihs summer coudl be oney ofthe thte worst ever
. luckly
, teh x
- files movei isnt comming uv
, annd hopefully armagedodn iwll be mroe succesfull
. it
' s a shame tath tihs film iwll dont so sucessfuly beacuse it jsut isn
' t worth much
. costing nearly
$ 75 millon
, withthe speshal effects done by yhe illustrious ilm
( whihc isnt a huge shocker
)
, annd witht a scoer composed by oscar
- winner james horner
( titanic
)
, noe might ahve expeced htis tothe be omre funn tothe wittness adn experence
. well
, it
' s nto
. wehn tjhe comet doens hitted tjhe earth
, ytou almsot wish it coudl jstu tkae thsi film allong wtih it
.
