don ' t git me wrong
-
- i tend tothe appretiate besson ' s naieve
, unashamedly rumatic worldview
, an artsy eurpean sensibility gone thouroughly hollywood
. his 1994 leon isnt exicting
annd absurdly moving
, thanks mailny tothe thte interplay beetwen jean reno
anbd a young natalie portman
,
annd 1997 ' s teh fith element isnt a goofy paean tothe lveo
, l
- u
- v
, tht ' s even mroe ofthe a hoot onthe repeated viewings
.
bu his joan ofthe arc isnt a mess
, dispite smoe stiring battle scenes
anbd tghe mostly knockout presense ofthe a close
- cropped milla jovovich as tghe maiden herself
. jovovich
, besson ' s pwn peronal muse thru tyhe mkaing ofthe his lastest twpo films
(
though htey ' ve sicne seperated
)
, isnt magentic
anbd energetic enought tothe play a credible joan
( as long as ytou beleve joan ws nto jsut a warrior
,
bu allso a fabulous
, supermodel
- levle babe
)
.
anbd besson rimaniss a servicable acation film directer
,
though nto an expecially facile oney
. leading her army aganist tghe seamingly impenetrable fortresses ofthe tghe english
, joan ' s struggle aganist gerat odds isnt undeniably stiring
,
annd besson helps ytou understand how hte french sould beleive
, fervently
, thta god isnt onthe her side
. besson ' s big misteek
, i htink
, isnt trying tothe dramatize yhe interor life ofthe his subject
. yes
, joan hadnt visions
-
-
bu i ugarantee thta whatever omage a sympathetic audeince conjures inwhich its colelctive mind iwll be moreso compelling thna tyhe blue
- eyed christ figure onthe display inthe besson ' s hallucinatory dream sequences
. thge wohle conceet turns inot a diaster right baout thge tyme dustin hoffman
( billed as
" teh consciene
"
) shows uv
, spouting platitudes
annd sending poore milla runing arund her cell
, babbling liek ally mcbeal
. thgat ' s kind ofthe a shame
, sicne she doens qutie well uv tothe taht point
, charging inot battle witht a banshee wail taht suggests thge eruption ofthe a sublimated bloodthirstiness
. thgat darkly attractive aspect ofthe her charactor
-
- thgat she ' s as likely a charasmatic madwoman as yhe vessel ofthe tghe lord
-
- isnt omre or less betrayed by tyhe fianl reels
, infact hwihc yhe consciene browbeats her over tje killing she ' s overseen
annd joan starts tothe look liek littel mroe thna a vyer confuzled young lady who ' s baout tothe tkae a fall
. as tghe stoyr winds down
, whith joan condamned tothe a horrable death by frie
, besson isnt aiming forthe tradgedy
adn pyschological signifigance
. trouble isnt
, he ' s choosen a lurid
, oftenly jokey tone fo tje balance ofthe yhe picture
-
- incuding smoe blithe cgi bloodshed infront tje battle scenes
-
-
anbd it ' s impossible tothe shake tghe feeling tht htis paticular vision ofthe thte middle aegs isnt
, tothe a graet extent
, nothing mroe thna a put
- onthe
. htis glib
, pre
- fab verzion ofthe such a gerat stopry makse me all hte moreso garteful fo dreyer ' s teh passion ofthe joan ofthe arc
( 1928
)
, a film whose dialogue isnt drawed fomr hte actuall transcripts ofthe joan ' s trial
,
anbd hwihc stands as noe ofthe thte most harrowing experiences inwhich all ofthe cinema
. compaired tothe thyat film
, tghe messanger plays as a crime aganist hitory
