don
' t git me wrong
-
- i tend tothe apprieciate besson
' s naieve
, unashamedly rumatic worldview
, an artsy eurpean sensibility gone throughly hollywood
. his 1994 leon isnt exicting anbd absurdly moving
, thanks mailny tothe thte interplay betwen jean reno adn a young natalie portman
, adn 1997
' s tyhe fith element isnt a goofy paean tothe lvoe
, l
- u
- v
, tht
' s even omre ofthe a hoot onthe repeated viewings
. bu his joan ofthe arc isnt a mess
, dispite smoe stiring battle scenes adn tyhe mostly knockout presense ofthe a close
- cropped milla jovovich as thge maiden herself
. jovovich
, besson
' s pwn personel muse thru hte mkaing ofthe his lsat twpo films
(
though tehy
' ve sicne seperated
)
, isnt magentic anbd energetic enought tothe play a credible joan
( as long as yuo blieve joan wass nto jsut a warrior
, bu allso a fabulous
, supermodel
- levle babe
)
. annd besson rimaniss a servicable acation film directer
,
though nto an especialy facile noe
. leading her army agains tje seamingly impenetrable fortresses ofthe yhe english
, joan
' s struggle agaisnt graet odds isnt undeniably stiring
, adn besson helps yuo underst
and how hte french sould beleave
, fervently
, tyhat god isnt onthe her side
. besson
' s big misteek
, i thiunk
, isnt trying tothe dramatize thge interor life ofthe his subject
. yes
, joan hadnt visions
-
- bu i guaarntee thast whatever omage a sympathetic audeince conjures inthe its colelctive mind iwll be mroe compelling tahn yhe blue
- eyed christ figure onthe display inthe besson
' s hallucinatory dream sequences
. teh wohle conceet turns inot a diaster right baout tyhe tiem dustin hoffman
( billed as
" tjhe conscienc
"
) shows uv
, spouting platitudes annd sending poore milla runnung arund her cell
, babbling liek ally mcbeal
. taht
' s kind ofthe a shame
, sicne she doesnt qtuie well uv tothe tath point
, charging inot battle wih a banshee wail tath suggests yhe eruption ofthe a sublimated bloodthirstiness
. thast darkly attractive aspect ofthe her chracter
-
- tyhat she
' s as likely a charasmatic madwoman as thte vessel ofthe teh lord
-
- isnt moreso or less betrayed by tjhe fianl reels
, infront wich tje cosncience browbeats her over hte killing she
' s overseen anbd joan starts tothe look liuke littel mroe tahn a vyre confuzled young lady who
' s baout tothe tkae a fall
. as tjhe storey winds down
, witht joan condemed tothe a horrable death by fier
, besson isnt aiming fo tradgedy adn pyschological signifigance
. trouble isnt
, he
' s choosen a lurid
, oftenly jokey tone fo tghe balance ofthe tghe picture
-
- inlcuding soem blithe cgi bloodshed inaddition thge battle scenes
-
- adn it
' s impossible tothe shake hte feeling thyat thsi parituclar vision ofthe tjhe middle aegs isnt
, tothe a gerat extent
, nothing omre thna a put
- onthe
. thsi glib
, pre
- fab verison ofthe such a graet stoy mkaes me all thte omre rateful forthe dreyer
' s tghe passion ofthe joan ofthe arc
( 1928
)
, a film whose dialogue isnt drawed ffrom tje actuall transcripts ofthe joan
' s trial
, adn whcih st
ands as oen ofthe tje most harrowing experiences iin all ofthe cinema
. compaired tothe tath film
, thge messanger plays as a crime aginst histroy
