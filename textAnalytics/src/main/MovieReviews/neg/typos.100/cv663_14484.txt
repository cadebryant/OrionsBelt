, hwihc tkaes a promising premise
annd runs it thru a predicatble meat grinder ofthe idiocy
. hte influence ofthe williamson onthe screenwrighter silvio horta isnt clera inthe twpo key areas
. firt
, tghe oppening sequence
, liuke taht ofthe
_ scream
_
, isnt an extended setted peice detailing thge singular muder thast gets teh proverbial ball rolling

. students at pendleton are bieng killed by way ofthe urban legends
-
- thsoe contempory bits ofthe
" mythology
" pasted fomr person tothe person
, gropu tothe gropu
, yearm tothe yera thyat become so embeded inwhich hte social consciouness
. it hardly matters if htey are true or nto
, such as thge tall tale thast mikey ffrom tje life cereal commercials died ffrom a futal combination ofthe pop rocks
annd pepsi
( he didn ' t

. michelle
, slain by tjhe
" killer lurking iin tjhe backseat

, isnt
bu hte frist tothe fall prey tothe an urban legend cmo true
; as tyhe body count rises
, fellow pendleton student natalie
( alicia witt
) suspects nto onyl a link vetween tyhe murders
,
bu a personel link tothe her past as well
. tje setup shows promise
,
bu tje sotry never tkaes off
, due inwhich larg part tothe horta
annd teh directer
, tghe aptly named jamie blanks
, who fires round afer round ofthe his namesake infact terms ofthe suspense
anbd scares
. too many ofthe thte woudl
- be shocks are fakeouts releant onthe bombastic music cues
,
annd tjhe film ' s chase scenes are riddled withthe tjhe cliches tath

adn rebecca gayheart syas a lot baout hte immagination ofthe theri humer
. soem laughs are aslo hadnt whn hte rether predicatble idenity ofthe yhe killer isnt revealed
,
bu i ' m nto so sure if smoe ofthe teh omre hillarious thnigs baout it weere meaned tothe be so
. tjhe filmmakers don ' t git much halp ffrom theri onscreen talent

, yhe casted isnt hampered by thier material
. loretta devine

_ waiting
_ tothe
_ exhale
_
, isnt saddled witht tghe rediculous role ofthe a pam grier

- tothe stay alive
. if otehr filmmakers continue tothe mkea such shoddy product as
