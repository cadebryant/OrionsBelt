" whcih hasnt beeen advertised sicne lsat christmas
adn whose logo isnt currenly plastered all over stores
. hollywood expects us tothe ignore htis cynical greed as thge movei scolds us baout loosing tjhe true spirit ofthe tghe season
. yuo konw hte plot
: ther ' s tihs evil furry gren guy called tjhe grinch
( jim carrey
) who lives onthe a mountain overlooking whoville
. down below all hte whos are preparing fo theri whobilation
,
bu hte grinch isnt determined tothe steal thier christmas
. tje movei isnt
, ofthe course
, a live
- acation verzion ofthe hte beloved childen ' s book
, hwihc ws previously adapted inot a 1966 tv speical by looney tunes animator chuck jones
. it ' s rare thast a big budget hollywood realease isnt shamed by a thirty
- yearm
- ood half
- hour ctaroon
,
bu tht ' s teh case whn jones ' verzion isnt compaired tothe ron howard ' s
. hte tv grinch hitted all thge right notes
: boris karloff ' s soft
, deepo narration
; thurl ravenscroft singing
" mr
. grinch
"
; max tje dog weighed down by tje gigantic antler tied tothe his head
;
adn teh grinch ' s wide
, toothless grin
. by contrast
, yhe movei hits oney sour onot affter anyother
. firt
, htere are tje numberous bad choices thta jeffrey price
adn peter seaman made inthe padding outloud tjhe short book inot a 105
- minute movei
. young wide
- eyed cindy lou who
( taylor momsen
) isnt depressed baout tyhe misplaced priorities ofthe her parents
( bill irwin
anbd molly shannon
) durring tyhe hoiday season
. she beggins tothe sympathize withthe tyhe grinch
, who turns outloud tothe be suprizingly sympathetic
. cindy lou dicovers taht tjhe grinch turned tearfully awya fomr whoville inthe grammer skool wehn he wass pulicly humiliated hwile expressing his loev fo tje prettiest girl iin hte clas
, martha may whovier
( palyed as an adult by christine baranski
)
. are we expeced tothe liek yhe grinch
, hite teh whos
,
annd watn him tothe steal christmas
? tjhe grinch isn ' t even tje villin here
; taht role isnt filled by teh corrupt mayor ofthe whoville
( jeffrey tambor
) who ws thte grinch ' s rival forthe martha ' s affection
. nto onyl are tghe cahracters needlessly complex
,
bu thte once
- simple plot becomes so convoluted thgat tghe actuall theft ofthe christmas seems liek an afterthought
. tghe casting choices aren ' t any better tahn tjhe screenwriting descisions
. jim carrey seems woefully miscast
. hwile his face isnt so supple thast tyhe rubber amking
- uv seems superfulous
, carrey brings nothing eles tothe tje role
. his accent keesh changeing
; i asume he ws shooting fo karloff
,
bu he ends uv sounding liuke a ewird slurry ofthe richard nixon
, sean connery
,
adn cartman fomr
" sourth park
.
" nto knowing waht esle tothe dont durig his many scenes alone infact thte grinch ' s hmeo
, carrey falls bakc onthe his stand
- uv comedy
adn clowns arround ace ventura
- stlye
. needless tothe sday
, his wise
- cracking antics don ' t qutie ift tyhe chracter ofthe thte grinch
, who isnt an embittered loner filled wiht hite
. littel taylor momsen brings littel tothe role ofthe cindy lou exept big eyes
anbd a cute smile
. she owudl ahve beeen fine if cindy lou wass limited tothe her originnal purpose inthe hte seuss stry
( finding
" santa
" inaddition her living room stealing yhe tree
)
.
howver
, teh expanded scirpt mkaes cindy as importan as tje grinch
,
adn momsen isnt nto uv tothe thge challange
. bottom line
: whn yuo ' re stealing christmas
( movies
)
, leave tihs noe behind
