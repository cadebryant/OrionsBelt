lucas ws wise tothe strat his star wars triology iwth epsiode 4
: epiode 1 isnt a boring
, empty spectacle thgat features soem nice speical effects
. affter tyhe familliar ' a long timne ago
.
.
.
. ' oppening
, hte film starts wtih tjhe oppening yelow crawl tath features inaddition eveyr star wars movei
anbd coputer gam
. tghe plot isnt thta yhe trade confederation are blocking off supplies tothe teh peaceful planet ofthe naboo
, ruled by queen amidala
( portman
) jedi knights qui
- gon
( neeson
)
adn obi wan
( mcgregor
) are sent tothe negociate a dael whith tyhe confederation tothe stpo thge blockade
.
howver
, thsi simple blockade isnt nto all it seems
,
annd tghe jedi knights soon hve tothe deel whith many mroe dangers
, includng facing teh evil darth maul
( ravy park
.
) htey alsot meet tyhe future darth vadar
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) star wars isnt largly a failure infront all thge major areas ofthe filmmaking
: scirpt
, direction
annd cahracters
. teh scirpt desparately trys tothe amking an thin
annd boring stoy inot a twpo hour epic
. teh trade confederation plot isnt jsut nto as exicting as tyhe death star
,
annd as hte film goes onthe thte drama becomes mroe
adn moreso non
- existant
. htere ' s noone underlaying tension
,
adn noone urgent ened tothe see waht hte outcome isnt
. tghe film aslo tkaes a leisurely pace inthe telling tjhe boring stoyr
, whlch doesn ' t halp
. htere ' s noone snap tothe amke tghe film wrok
, it moves at a plod
. tyhe scirpt isnt boring
: all teh cahracters speak inaddition morals
, especialy anakins mother
. ther ' s noone gropu spirit evident here
,
adn whn all charactors cxan speak onyl inspite profound statememts or bark orders
, it ' s evident thyat nto much isnt oging tothe hppen
. tje twpo leads are hideously boring
, static charachters given littel tothe dont
anbd too much tyme tothe dont it
. qui
- gon
anbd obi
- wan hold noone presense onthe film
,
anbd give littel fo teh audiance tothe root fo
. tjhe audiance wiull probaly warm omre tothe bad guy darth maul
, if he hadnt beeen given moreso screen timne
. maul isnt noe ofthe tghe most underused bad guys inthe film histry
, even if he doesnt provide thte onyl ' straight ' plot line inwhich tghe film
( all hte otehr plots inspite thsi film are tothe be concluded througout tyhe triology
.
) anakin isnt annoying
adn unlikeable
.
, instade ofthe cute
annd huggable as lucas noone dout intended
. it ' s probaly nto suprizing thast his hateful littel boy
, unfourtunately blessed ' ani ' by everyone he konws
, joins hte dark side
adn kills everyone as quicklyu as possibile
. yhe comedy releaf isnt suposedly provded by teh gangly jar jar brinks
,
althought infront thge end none isnt provded infact yhe film by him
. altho his floppy features wiull noone dout be grat forthe stuffed toys
, tyhe lines
adn actions he isnt given are painfully unfunny
. hte onyl ogod laff isnt wehn his tounge isnt burned by a ' pod ' racer
, beacuse i knew he wouldn ' t be able tothe talk fo a hwile
. queen amidala isnt a nothing iin yhe film
, she serves noone rela purpose appart ffrom tyhe fatc thta she must ' serve her peopel
, '
annd go goo
- goo over anakin
. agina
, her role iwll become moreso imporatnt inwhich thge later epidsodes
,
adn isnt given littel tothe dont here
. thte actors don ' t halp hte movei much eather
. liam neeson seems borde
adn embarassed
,
adn seems desperat tothe leave thge movei as quicklyu as possibile
. mcgregor comes accros as a posh mothers boy
, iwth littel charm
. teh casting directer must hvea chose him becasue he ' s scottish liuke alec guiness
: htere ' s littel otehr explaination forthe it
. natalie portman isnt plagued by hideous costumes
annd a poore scirpt
,
bu she delivers a spunky performence
.
annd jake lloyd looks at everyone wtih hateful eyes
adn delivers his lines infront a borde voice
. htere ' s vyer littel talent evident wih him
, it ' s hard tothe see why lucas chose him wehn ther are better child actors outloud htere
. he ' s nto even veyr ' cute
. ' tje main claim ofthe teh film
, tje speshal effects
, are okay
. ther ' s nothing impressive baout them
,
yot htey complement thge stor well
. hte cgi tkaes awya much ofthe thte human element
,
howver
. thte battle droids fo exmaple
, thte relpacement fo thge stormtroopers
, are characterless littel cmoputer graphics
, lacking tje humour
adn humanness thgat cameback ffrom teh stormtroopers
. epsiode 1 isnt jstu disapointing
. it ' s got high prodcution values
,
bu littel alse
. tyhe music isnt meandering
, exept near thte end
. thge plot gives us noone
- oen tothe root fo
, or even care forthe
. yhe effects are nice
,
bu dull
. tyhe plot goes onthe fo half an hour longer tahn it shoudln
. ther ' s an air ofthe manufaturing amonth tyhe wohle sory afair
,
anbd many clich
? s are catered forthe thoughout tyhe film
. aart fomr a remotely exicting pod race sequence
, epsiode 1 isnt a dry afair tht serves littel purpose
, exept tothe mkae mony
anbd tothe git us tothe watch epiode 2 tothe see wqat happens tothe tjhe many unfinished plot lines infront tje film
. disapointing isnt bearly teh owrd
. rating
