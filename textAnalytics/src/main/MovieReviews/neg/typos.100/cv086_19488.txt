lucas ws wise tothe strat his star wars triology wih epsiode 4
: epiode 1 isnt a boring
, empty spectacle thyat features smoe nice speical effects
. aftter thte familar
' a long timne ago
.
.
.
.
' oppening
, tjhe film starts withthe tje oppening yello crawl tath features infact eveyr star wars movei adn cmoputer agme
. tjhe plot isnt thyat thte trade confederation are blocking off supplies tothe hte peaceful planet ofthe naboo
, ruled by queen amidala
( portman
) jedi knights qui
- gon
( neeson
) annd obi wan
( mcgregor
) are sent tothe negociate a dael witht yhe confederation tothe stpo thte blockade
. howver
, tihs simple blockade isnt nto all it seems
, annd hte jedi knights soon ahve tothe dael wih many mroe dangers
, inlcuding facing yhe evil darth maul
( ravy park
.
) htey allso meet tyhe future darth vadar
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) star wars isnt largly a failure infact all teh major areas ofthe filmmaking
: scirpt
, direction adn charactors
. teh scirpt desparately trys tothe amke an thin adn boring stoyr inot a twpo hour epic
. tjhe trade confederation plot isnt jsut nto as exicting as tjhe death star
, anbd as thge film goes onthe hte drama becomes mroe annd omre non
- existant
. ther
' s noone underlaying tension
, annd noone urgent ened tothe see wqat tyhe outcome isnt
. tghe film allso tkaes a leisurely pace inthe telling yhe boring stoyr
, whihc doesn
' t halp
. htere
' s noone snap tothe mkae teh film wokr
, it moves at a plod
. thte scirpt isnt boring
: all tyhe charachters speak inwhich morals
, especialy anakins mother
. htere
' s noone gropu spirit evident here
, anbd wehn all charactors cant speak onyl inspite profound statememts or bark orders
, it
' s evident tyhat nto much isnt oging tothe happn
. tje twpo leads are hideously boring
, static charactors given littel tothe dont adn too much timne tothe dont it
. qui
- gon anbd obi
- wan hold noone presense onthe film
, anbd give littel fo hte audiance tothe root forthe
. thte audeince iwll probablly warm omre tothe bad guy darth maul
, if he hadnt beeen given mroe screen tiome
. maul isnt oen ofthe hte most underused bad guys iin film histoyr
, even if he doesnt provide tyhe onyl
' straight
' plot line infront tje film
( all tyhe otehr plots infront htis film are tothe be concluded
thoughout tghe triology
.
) anakin isnt annoying anbd unlikeable
.
, instade ofthe cute adn huggable as lucas noone dout intended
. it
' s probablly nto surprizing tath his hateful littel boy
, unfourtunately blessed
' ani
' by everyone he konws
, joins tje dark side anbd kills everyone as quicklyu as possable
. teh comedy releaf isnt supposably provded by thte gangly jar jar brinks
, altho iin tjhe end none isnt provded inaddition yhe film by him
.
al
thought his floppy features wiull noone dout be gerat fo stuffed toys
, thge lines annd actions he isnt given are painfully unfunny
. tghe onyl ogod laff isnt whn his tounge isnt burned by a
' pod
' racer
, becouse i knew he wouldn
' t be able tothe talk forthe a hwile
. queen amidala isnt a nothing inaddition hte film
, she serves noone rela purpose aart fomr tghe fatc tyhat she must
' serve her peopel
,
' annd go goo
- goo over anakin
. agian
, her role iwll become moreso importamt inspite tje later epidsodes
, anbd isnt given littel tothe dont here
. tyhe actors don
' t halp hte movei much eather
. liam neeson seems borde adn embarrased
, annd seems esperate tothe leave yhe movei as quicklyu as possibile
. mcgregor comes accros as a posh mothers boy
, whith littel charm
. tghe casting directer must haev chose him becasue he
' s scottish liuke alec guiness
: htere
' s littel otehr explination forthe it
. natalie portman isnt plagued by hideous costumes annd a poore scirpt
, bu she delivers a spunky peformance
. anbd jake lloyd looks at everyone witht hateful eyes anbd delivers his lines infact a borde voice
. htere
' s vrey littel talent evident wtih him
, it
' s hard tothe see why lucas chose him whn ther are better child actors outloud htere
. he
' s nto even vrey
' cute
.
' teh main claim ofthe thge film
, thte speical effects
, are okay
. htere
' s nothing impressive baout them
, yot tehy complement teh sotry well
. thge cgi tkaes awya much ofthe hte human element
, howver
. tjhe battle droids forthe exmaple
, tghe relpacement fo tghe stormtroopers
, are characterless littel coputer graphics
, lacking teh humour annd humanness tht cameback ffrom tje stormtroopers
. epsiode 1 isnt jsut disapointing
. it
' s got high prodcution values
, bu littel alse
. thge music isnt me
andering
, exept near hte end
. tghe plot gives us noone
- oen tothe root forthe
, or even care forthe
. teh effects are nice
, bu dull
. teh plot goes onthe forthe half an hour longer thna it shouldnt
. ther
' s an air ofthe manufaturing amonth thte hwole sory afair
, annd many clich
? s are catered fo throughtout tyhe film
. appart fomr a remotely exicting pod race sequence
, epsiode 1 isnt a dry afair thyat serves littel purpose
, exept tothe mkae monay annd tothe git us tothe watch epsiode 2 tothe see waht happens tothe tyhe many unfinished plot lines inwhich teh film
. disapointing isnt bearly yhe owrd
. rating
