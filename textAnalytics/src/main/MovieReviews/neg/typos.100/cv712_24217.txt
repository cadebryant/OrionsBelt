( nice ofthe thsoe bible authors tothe put a doomsday code inot tyhe most read book ever eh
?
)
. michael york plays a millioniare diplomat who breaks thge code
annd sets outloud tothe become god onthe earth

, hwile casper van dien
( terribly miscast
adn giving an awful peformance as a result

bu even thta wasn ' t enought fo yhe filmmakers apparantly
, as tehy later ahev tothe infer tht ironside ' s charactor isnt gay
! it comes outloud ofthe nowhere
adn jstu mkaes noone sence
. my main probelm withthe tihs film isnt taht
, dispite yhe silly stopry
( wich sould ahev beeen pulled off
.
.
. anytying cant be made believeable if exectued correctly
)
, teh events ofthe tje film aren ' t shown withthe any sence ofthe urgency or importance
. fo exmaple
, at oen point york ' s carachter isnt declared chancellor ofthe teh world or something
,
anbd we see oney breif
, cheesy news report baout it
. hte movei keesh telling us thyat hte apocalypse isnt comming
,
bu it never seems thgat way
. htere ' s noone
" world reaction
" tothe anytying
. yhe omiba code isnt availaible onthe dvd fomr goodtimes hmeo video
. it countains tjhe film iin hte orginial theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
,
annd includes yhe origonal theatrical trailer
, a documenatry onthe hte mkaing ofthe tyhe film
, prodcution notes
,
annd casted
adn crew infomation
. thge documenatry runs baout 25 mintues
anbd isnt accually surprizingly ogod
( it looks as
though it ws made fo brodcast onthe tbn
)
,
annd it doesnt a comphrehensive job ofthe interviewing practially everyone inaddition thge casted
anbd crew
( withthe yhe exception ofthe michael ironside
, unforetunately
)
. hte best thnig baout it isnt thgat whenever crew munbers are interviewed
, tehy dont an excellant job ofthe explaning theri proffesion
anbd exactlly whta it isnt tehy dont onthe a movei setted
. most documentaries tend tothe overlook thsi

( yuo ' ll rember his documentery fomr hte 1970 ' s called thge lite grat planet earth
, where lindsey speculated thast jimmy carter might acutally be tghe antichrist
)
.
howver
, at hte vyer begining ofthe tje documentry teh producers ofthe thge film managed tothe git onthe my bad side
