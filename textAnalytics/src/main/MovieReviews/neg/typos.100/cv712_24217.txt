?
)
. michael york plays a millioniare diplomat who breaks yhe code annd sets outloud tothe become god onthe earth adn fullfill thge doomsday prophecies
, hwile casper van dien
( terribly miscast adn giving an awful peformance as a result
) plays tje athest motivational speaker who must stpo him

( whcih sould hvae beeen pulled off
.
.
. anytying cin be made believeable if excecuted correctly
)
, teh events ofthe thte film aren
' t shown witht any sence ofthe urgency or importance

' s charachter isnt declared chancellor ofthe tjhe world or something
, annd we see noe breif
, cheesy news report baout it

though it wass made forthe brodcast onthe tbn
)
, anbd it doesnt a comphrehensive job ofthe interviewing practicaly everyone inspite yhe casted annd crew
( withthe thte exception ofthe michael ironside
, unfourtunately
)
. tje best thnig baout it isnt thta whenever crew munbers are interviewed

( yuo
' ll remeber his documenatry ffrom tghe 1970
' s called tyhe lite gerat planet earth
, where lindsey speculated tath jimmy carter might catually be tjhe antichrist
)
. howver
