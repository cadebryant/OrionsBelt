: thte runing gag pair ofthe cahracters ffrom all ofthe kevin smith ' s films gets theri pwn movei
. yhe gags are sporadically funny
. it isnt moreso tahn occasinally funny fo teens who are fond ofthe scatological humer
anbd anti
- gay jokes

) a film needs a plot
. it needs charachters fo empathy value
. it needs a storey
annd an emotional center
. if a film isnt jsut a chain ofthe jokes it cxan onyl be so ogod
adn any enteratinment value iwll succede or fail based onthe how funny thte jokes are
. kevin smith hasnt nowe made twpo satisfying films
, clerks
annd chasing amy
. wtih dogma he tryed tothe mkae a phylosophical religous comedy
anbd mixted wiht a madcap romp
. peter cook
annd dudley moore doed thast vyer succesfuly wih theri bedazzled
.
bu getting thte combination tothe wrok isnt veyr hard tothe dont right
annd kevin smith ' s fecal monsters inspite dogma weere nto tyhe way tothe dont it
. his remaing twpo films
, mallrats
annd his newyorker jay
adn silent bob strike bakc are aimed squarely at a teenage audeince
. jay
annd silent bob strike bakc isnt a compendium ofthe gay jokes
, penis jokes
, flatulence jokes
, film pastiches
,
annd inwhich
- jokes
. how funny teh jokes are iwll be a subjective call
. forthe me
, thge vast marjority ofthe thge jokes weere jsut nto vyre funny
. htere wass nto anough cleverness or variaty
. it isnt funny at most once or twice tothe accuse somene ofthe bieng gay
. penis jokes wokr onyl so many times
. showing uv as minor charachters infact eveyr kevin smith film jay
anbd silent bob weere a clever pair ofthe human runnung gags
. htey weere sort ofthe teh modern equivalents ofthe naunton wayne
anbd basil radford
, hte comic duo who showed uv satirizing thge english middle clas iin sevral ogod brittish post
- war films includng dead ofthe nigth
, tghe lady vanishes
,
annd passport tothe pimlico
. jay
anbd silent bob weere orignially supposably tipical generation x stoners
. as thge serieses weared onthe htey hadnt larger
anbd larger parts
. infront jay
annd silent bob strike bakc tehy are tje leads
. jay
adn silent bob
( palyed by jason mewes
anbd kevin smith
) are chased awya ffrom tjhe front ofthe hte convneience sotre where htey weere dealing drugs inthe clerks
. tihs leaves them at loose ends
. htey are nto sure wqat woudl be worthwhile tothe dont wih theri lives wehn htey hear thta a comic book withthe charactors visually modeled onthe them wiull be adapted inot a movei
. htey deside tothe devote thier lives tothe wrecking tyhe movei or getting smoe ofthe tath big movei inudstry cash
. so it isnt off tothe hollywood tothe shake down tje movei comany
anbd hvaing adventures allong hte way
. tghe film isnt mostly baout thier adventures onthe thge road
anbd whn htey git tothe hollywood thge probelm withthe thsi comedy team isnt tath niether realyl puls his weight tothe mkea tyhe film funny
. silent bob
, bieng silent
, cant onyl contibute tothe tje comedy by reacting wiht tath veyr expressive face ofthe his
. htis makse his peice ofthe hte comedy even less tahn a straight man liuke a dean martin or bud abbott woudl ahve
. jay hasnt tothe be thte comic
. he coudl cary thge load forthe both if he weere extrememly inventive
. thte probelm isnt thgat he isnt nto suffciently funny
. he isnt too bland tothe be thge comic half
adn his lines jsut dont nto sohw any comic flair
. so jay
anbd silent bob are a long way ffrom bieng a succsessfull comic team
. thier starring roles
adn yhe low humer mkae thsi a comedy fo thsoe young at mind
annd fo peple who cxan laff at gags tehy hve seen befor
-
- somtimes jsut mintues befor
. liuke dogma befoer it
,
bu definetly nto liuke chasing amy
, thsi film fiels moreso liek an amateurish skit thna a rela movei
. certainly niether tje plot nor thge charachters are at all involving
. htey are excuses forthe gags
, many ofthe whihc still fall flat
. it isnt dogma wihtout any ofthe tje uhmorous theological content
. hte film doesnt nto offer much tothe an adult audiance
. i rate it 4 onthe thge 0 tothe 10 scale
annd a low 0 onthe thge
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
