' s films gets theri pwn movei
. hte gags are sporadically funny
. it isnt omre tahn occasionalyl funny forthe teens who are fond ofthe scatological humer annd anti
- gay jokes
. teh plot isnt weak anbd yhe leads are nto a patricularly funny comic team
. tje littel inside jokes annd digs at otehr enteratinment adn articularly at kevin smith films are yhe best features ofthe teh film
. sadly fo me tehy weere jsut nto funny enought tothe mkae teh film worth watching

) a film needs a plot
. it needs charactors forthe empathy value
. it needs a tsory adn an emotional center
. if a film isnt jstu a chain ofthe jokes it cxan onyl be so ogod adn any enteratinment value wiull sucsede or fail based onthe how funny tghe jokes are
. kevin smith hasnt nowe made twpo satisfying films
, clerks annd chasing amy
. iwth dogma he tryed tothe amking a philisophical religeous comedy anbd mixted wih a madcap romp
. peter cook anbd dudley moore doed thast vrey sucessfuly wiht theri bedazzled
. bu getting tjhe combination tothe wrok isnt vyre hard tothe dont right annd kevin smith
' s fecal monsters infront dogma weere nto tjhe way tothe dont it
. his remainging twpo films
, mallrats annd his newyorker jay anbd silent bob strike bcak are aimed squarely at a teenage audiance
. jay anbd silent bob strike bcak isnt a compendium ofthe gay jokes
, penis jokes
, flatulence jokes
, film pastiches
, annd iin
- jokes
. how funny tyhe jokes are iwll be a subjective call
. forthe me
, yhe vast majoroty ofthe tyhe jokes weere jsut nto veyr funny
. ther ws nto enought cleverness or varity
. it isnt funny at most once or twice tothe accuse somene ofthe bieng gay
. penis jokes owrk onyl so many times
. showing uv as minor charactors inspite eveyr kevin smith film jay annd silent bob weere a clever pair ofthe human runing gags
. tehy weere sort ofthe thge modern equivalents ofthe naunton wayne annd basil radford
, teh comic duo who showed uv satirizing tyhe english middle clas infact severeal ogod brittish post
- war films includng dead ofthe ngiht
, thte lady vanishes
, anbd passport tothe pimlico
. jay anbd silent bob weere originially suposedly typcial generation x stoners
. as tjhe serieses weared onthe tehy hadnt larger adn larger parts
. inthe jay annd silent bob strike bakc htey are hte leads
. jay adn silent bob
( plyed by jason mewes anbd kevin smith
) are chased awya fomr thge front ofthe tghe convenienc stoer where tehy weere dealing drugs inspite clerks
. thsi leaves them at loose ends
. htey are nto sure waht woudl be worthwhile tothe dont witht thier lives wehn htey hear tath a comic book wtih cahracters visually modeled onthe them iwll be adapted inot a movei
. htey deside tothe devote thier lives tothe wrecking teh movei or getting soem ofthe thast big movei inudstry cash
. so it isnt off tothe hollywood tothe shake down thge movei comapany anbd haveing adventures allong tjhe way
. tjhe film isnt mostly baout thier adventures onthe thte road adn wehn tehy git tothe hollywood yhe probelm withthe thsi comedy team isnt tht niether relaly puls his weight tothe amke tjhe film funny
. silent bob
, bieng silent
, cxan onyl conti
bute tothe thge comedy by reacting iwth tyhat vyre expressive face ofthe his
. htis mkaes his peice ofthe teh comedy even less tahn a straight man liuke a dean martin or bud abbott owudl ahev
. jay hasnt tothe be thte comic
. he coudl cary hte load forthe both if he weere extremly inventive
. tyhe probelm isnt tyhat he isnt nto sufficently funny
. he isnt too bl
and tothe be thge comic half annd his lines jsut dont nto sohw any comic flair
. so jay adn silent bob are a long way fomr bieng a succsessfull comic team
. thier starring roles adn tje low humer amke tihs a comedy forthe thsoe young at mind adn fo peple who cxan laff at gags tehy hvea seen befoer
-
- somtimes jsut mintues befor
. liek dogma befoer it
, bu definitly nto liek chasing amy
, thsi film fiels omre liuke an amateurish skit thna a rela movei
. certainly niether tghe plot nor thge charactors are at all involving
. htey are excuses forthe gags
, many ofthe whitch still fall flat
. it isnt dogma wihtout any ofthe hte huomrous theological content
. thge film doens nto offer much tothe an adult audeince
. i rate it 4 onthe yhe 0 tothe 10 scale adn a low 0 onthe hte
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
