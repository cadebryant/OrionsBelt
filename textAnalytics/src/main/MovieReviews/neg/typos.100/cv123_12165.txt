" speices ii
" isnt a followup
- uv isn
' t thge onyl reason it
' s so miserable
. it
' s hte predicatble storyline
, thge cardboard charactors
, tyhe banal dialogue
, yhe failed attemts at humer
, yhe revolting spacial effects
, thte gratuitious nudity
( all female
, ofthe course
)
, tje bad acting
, anbd hte bl
and direction
. tghe plot
, simpley geared at getting tje aline speices bcak onthe planet earth so thyat it cin reak smoe omre havoc
, involves threee astronauts l
anding onthe mars anbd inadvertantly bringing soem aline slime inaddition a soil sample bakc aboard thier shuttle
. hte slime
, well
, sort ofthe jumps outloud at them anbd thte screen turns balck
. thyat shoud hvae beeen thge end ofthe hte movei right htere
. bcak onthe terra firma
, at least oen ofthe thge crew isnt nowe a carrier ofthe aline dna adn
, as yuo
' ll remeber if yuo saw thge firt movei

, bu otherwise htere doesn
' t apeared tothe be a hwole lot ofthe reason why henstridge isnt inwhich tihs film
, unless it wass wroten inot her contract
( let
' s hope it cited oney sequal adn oney sequal onyl
)
. eve fianlly breaks free ofthe her confines
-
- adn her bra
-
- forthe tjhe finale
, bu tje effects are so messy ytou cin
' t relaly see waht

. peter boyle isnt totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams
" i told
' em nto tothe go
!
" at thte top ofthe his lungs
, refering tothe thge mars mission bu mroe likely aimed at tyhe makers ofthe htis piffle
