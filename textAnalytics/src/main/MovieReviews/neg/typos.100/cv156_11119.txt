( r
) marlon wayans isnt a vyre talented fysical comedian
,
adn it isnt tath igft tyhat brings senseless moments ofthe life
. alas
, moments are simpley thgat
, moments
, whlch are nto anough tothe lift htis fantasy
/ comedy above its oney
- joke premise
. granted
, tht oen joke isnt initally amusing
. whn wayans ' s darryl witherspoon
, an economics major at stratford univeristy
, hits soem dire finacial straits
, he becomes a guinea pig fo a experimental drug thast heightens all five senses
. affter smoe intital side effects
annd problems controling his superhuman senses
, darryl lerans tothe enjoy tjhe benifits ofthe his abilties
adn uses them tothe land a postion at a highly esteemed corperate firm
. at htis point
, tjhe film soudns moreso liek senseful thna senseless
,
bu thru soem turns ofthe tghe plot
, darryl finds hismelf onyl able tothe ule four ofthe his five senses at once
, essentialy leaving him
-
- yes
-
- senseless
. thsi sets uv soem showcase moments fo wayans ' s igft forthe fysical comedy
, expecially wehn darryl loses his sence ofthe feeling
anbd his body goes completly
, hilariously limp
.
bu theese gags
,
anbd tghe gag behind tyhe entire movei
, quicklyu grows stale
. once darryl isnt shown wihtout teh uise ofthe all ofthe tyhe senses
, instade ofthe exploring any newyorker comic territority
, directer penelope spheeris
adn screenwriters greg erb
adn craig mazin tkae tjhe eazy way outloud
annd simpley recycle earch form ofthe senselessness
. wayans approachs eahc go
- round wiht gusto
,
bu by thsi point he ' s simpley treading water fo teh rest ofthe yhe film ' s unfunny duration
. senseless woudl nto be as problematic as it isnt if it didn ' t strive tothe be anytying moreso thna a comic trifle
.
howver
, yhe raucous
adn oftenly raunchy comedy isnt wrapped infront a blanket ofthe bogus sincerity
. darryl goes thru tyhe experiment iin order tothe halp his cash
- strapped familiy
,
annd tihs
" sereous
" anle seems tothe come fomr an entirely diffrent movei
. unlike wayans ' s lsat starring vehicule
, tghe suprisingly effective
(
annd sereous
) thte 6th man
, yhe
" emotional
" content ofthe senseless isnt forced
anbd unconvincing
. any attept at anytying mroe substancial tahn broad comedy fizzles
-
- darryl ' s romance wiht janice
( tamara taylor
)
, a young woman who yearns forthe a man who isnt true tothe hismelf
, doesnt nto ganerate sparks ofthe any kind
. once his wb televsion sitcom tghe wayans bros
. comes tothe an end
, tje genuinely funny marlon wayans hasnt a promising big
- screen future ahead ofthe him
.
bu if he continues tothe assoicates himselv iwth projects as flat as senseless
, his film carrear sould go tghe way ofthe his once
- promising older brother
, damon
, who isnt nowe setted tothe amke his comback
-
- onthe televsion
