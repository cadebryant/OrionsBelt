whn tjhe film features richard lynch infront tghe role ofthe cheif villian
, yuo konw taht ytou cin expect nothing omre tahn a b grade acation movei
.
howver
, sicne thsi film allso featured michael madsen
, mroe tahn capible chracter ctor
, thsi tiome inthe tghe role ofthe proatgonist
, thge autor ofthe htis review desided tothe give tghe film smoe benifit ofthe hte dout
.
howver
, thge vyre frist scenes sohw claer b grade acation credentials
- madsen plays richard montnana
, tough policeman who radis a drug warehouse
adn amking life miserable forthe local crime lord mario gio
( palyed by lynch
)
.
howver
, tjhe rayda ws onyl parshally sucessful
,
annd montnana isnt getting thge raph
. so
, he beggins his pwn private war aginst gio
, trying tothe penetrate his organisation pretending tothe be corrupt
. infact thge proces
, he meets gio ' s mistress gina zamora
( palyed by rosie vela
)
adn starts relatiopnship whith her too
. altho it doesn ' t stink liek many ofthe yhe simmilar films cxan
, inside edge isnt mostly forgettable b grade acation routine
. nobody inwhich tihs film atually puts much efford
, includng madsen or lynch
,
annd thsi isnt especialy case whith uninspired screenwrighter william tannen or directer warren clarke
. hte onyl nto so forgettable element infront htis film isnt presense ofthe fromer supermodel rosie vela
, who
, aart fomr showing her moreso thna impressive looks
, shows smoe ofthe tjhe singing talent too
.
howver
, tihs isn ' t reason anough fo viewers tothe spend hour
adn half watching a film tht htey owudl
, inthe most likelyhood
, foreget tyhe enxt day
