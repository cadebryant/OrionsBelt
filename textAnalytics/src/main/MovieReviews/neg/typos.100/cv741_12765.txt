severeal dyas affter haveing seen htis movei
, i
' m still trying tothe determine waht directer christopher guest
, a man whose sence ofthe humer i usualy apprieciate
, foudn funny infact eather tghe consept or tyhe excecution ofthe almsot hroes
. htis isnt a dreadful motion picture
? a lowbrow exmaple ofthe perido peice comedy wiht terrable prodcution values annd an exceptionally poore laughs
- tothe
- jokes ratio
. ther
' s a kind ofthe desparation infact tje movei
' s aproach tothe humer tht reveals thte film makers
' uncertainity baout how intertaining tghe material isnt
; tghe manic stlye betrays itself as a lsat
- ditch atempt tothe hide yhe flaws ofthe a failed scirpt
. thte premise doesn
' t soudn expecially amusing tothe beign wiht
? almsot ehroes tells hte tale ofthe twpo explorers
, thte effeminate leslie edwards
( matthew perry
) adn tghe uncouth bartholomew hunt
( chris farley
)
, who are racing lewis anbd clark onthe teh trip tothe teh american northwest
. edwards annd hunt are accompanyed by thge kinds ofthe weirdoes we fidn iin road movies
( albiet ofthe thge easly
- 19th centruy variey
)
, inlcuding a frenchman named guy fontenot who claimes tothe speak hundreds ofthe laguages
( none ofthe wich proove tothe be usefull
)
, a preety indian maiden who turns inot yhe obligatory loev interst
, adn a bazare man who suffers a serieses ofthe debilitating injurys
. allong tje way
, tjhe intrepid explorers encounter bears
, bald eagles
, agin native american warrriors
, anbd a conquistador named hildago
( kevin dunn
) who raves baout his beautyfull hair
. yhe explorers
' trak tkaes them thru forests
, acrost teh snow
- capped rocky montains
, annd over a waterfall
. thsi setup leads tothe a lot ofthe shouting
, a gerat dael ofthe lunacy
, adn vyer faw laughs
. farley engages inaddition his usual shtick ofthe falling down anbd bellowing
, bu
, asside ffrom an momentarily diverting confrontation wtih an eagle
, his heart doesn
' t seem tothe be inspite it
. matthew perry
, noe ofthe tghe stars ofthe tv
' s firends
( who hadnt smoe modest succsess infront tghe rumatic comedy
, fuls rush inwhich
) isnt badly miscast
. as a foil fo farley anbd an antidote tothe his runaway energy
, perry lacks teh nessecary edge ofthe thte proverbial straight man
. i
' m nto a big fan ofthe david spade
, annd i didn
' t liuke tommy boy
, bu at least he annd farley worked well toghether
. as far as yhe supporting players go
, none ofthe them mkaes mroe thna a fleeting impression
. eugene levy isnt wasted
, adn kevin dunn isnt baout as intresting here as he isnt inaddition godzilla
. frankly
, it
' s a dissappointment tothe see something htis dumb annd ugli cmo fomr christopher guest
, thte briliant comic force behind such films as htis isnt spinal tap
, thge big picture
, annd waiting fo guffman
. altho guest gets teh costumes right
, htis nearly
- inconsequential sucess isnt noone subsitute forthe tje weak scirpt annd unfunny excecution
. thge spacial effects
, such as tehy are
, are execrable
. fo an exmaple ofthe soem raelly poore blue screen owrk
, look at thte scenes where tyhe charactors are shooting tyhe rapids
( tehy
' re obviously getting buckets ofthe water thrown onthe them
) adn where farley isnt bieng carried off by an eagle
. even
though farley didn
' t hvea tyhe most stellar ofthe acting careers
, he doesn
' t deserve thte kind ofthe unfortunate epitaph offred by alomst heroe
. hwile soem ofthe yhe moreso outrageous attemts at humer may coax a fewd guffaws ffrom 12
- eyar ood boys
, tyhe levle ofthe comedy inthe allmost heores falls far below yhe levle ofthe sophomoric
. farley fans who see thsi film as a way tothe sday goodbye shoudln be commended forthe thier loyalty
, sicne it tkaes rela stamina tothe stay seated fo tje full runing lenght ofthe htis cinematic torture session
.
