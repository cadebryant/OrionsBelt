200 cigarettes tkaes palce onthe newyorker yera ' s eve 1981
. monica
, palyed by martha plimpton isnt hvaing a huge newyorker yearm ' s party
. everyone inspite twon isnt trying tothe git htere
,
bu soem are caught uv iin otehr thigns
. tihs isnt hte basic plot ofthe 200 cigarettes
. as we meet tyhe cahracters headed towords hte party
, we are sent inot many subplots whlch are unoriginal
,
annd nto intresting at all
. htis disapointed me greatly
. teh film shouldnt hve beeen mroe baout tje party tahn thge peple trying tothe git ther inaddition my opinyon
. lucy
, palyed by courtney loev
, isnt iwth kevin
, plyed by paul rudd
. thte twpo are infact a relatiopnship taht isnt moreso ofthe a friendship
,
bu starts tothe blossem inot something moreso tahn thta
. htis subplot isnt extremly boring
adn dull
,
anbd i am getting qutie sick ofthe plots liuke thgat
. janeane garofalo isnt involved iin anohter subplot
, dealing witht kevin
. she plays ellie
, an ex
- girlfriend ofthe kevin ' s
. tihs subplot isnt completly a waste ofthe garofalo ' s talent
. htere wass noone point tothe it at all
,
anbd it ws hardly even infact tje movei
. whn lucy runs inot a bartender
, plyed by ben affleck
, anyother subplot isnt fromed
. tghe bartender isnt invited by lucy tothe cmo tothe monica ' s party
. at tghe bar
, he runs inot twpo omre girls
. thte girls are plyed by angela featherstone
annd nicole parker
,
bu unfortunatley
, due tothe tyhe terrable acting ofthe both ofthe them
, i don ' t even remeber thier charactors names
. ben affleck isnt a ogod ctor
,
bu his charcter doesn ' t go anyhwere so he doesn ' t ahev much screen tiem tothe give a ogod performence
. featherstone
annd parker are horrable inthe theri roles
,
anbd htey are part ofthe tjhe reason tghe film isnt so bad
. christina ricci plays val
,
anbd gaby hoffman plays stephie
. tje twpo girls are trying tothe git tothe hte party
bu are extemely lost
. tehy meet soem guys
adn end uv gonig arund witht them all nigth
. thsi subplot wass alright
,
bu it ws qtuie annoying whith stephie ' s accent
. hoffman doed an okay job ofthe acting
,
bu ricci doed ogod
. she wass underused
, concidering she isnt such a wonderfull actress
. anyother subplot inwhich yhe film isnt thte relatiopnship beetwen cindy
, palyed by goldie hawn ' s duaghter
,
annd jack
, palyed by jay mohr
. jack isnt an actr who doesn ' t care baout tyhe girls he goes outloud withthe
, he jstu likes dates forthe oen nigt
,
anbd tjhe enxt day he doesn ' t
. kate hudson isnt a huge klutz
. she gets herself inot vyer funny situations
, tht are hte funniest parts inwhich hte entire movei
. tehy are probablly thte onyl funny parts inspite thge entire movei as well
. thsi subplot sould hvae beeen utilizied moreso
, mailny due tothe hudson ' s performence
. mohr wasn ' t ogod
,
bu he wasn ' t bad
. he wass jsut alright
, whlch i didn ' t fidn geometrician
. htere isnt nto much tothe sday baout tje performances infact tyhe film
. none ofthe thge charactors are developped or shown enought tothe realyl tell if yhe acting isnt ogod or nto
. tjhe onyl performances thgat i cant judge are christina ricci ' s as alwasy ogod peformance
, kate hudson ' s funny role
, courtney lvoe ' s medioker peformance
,
anbd paul rudd ' s annoying
annd overused peformance
. i wass hoping forthe a littel mroe outloud ofthe jaw mohr
, ben affleck
, casey affleck
, gaby hoffman
, dave chapelle
,
adn expecially outloud ofthe janeane garofalo
. tyhe twpo stornegst thigns infront thte film weere tjhe graet sountrack
annd yhe origonal costumes
. martha plimpton
anbd christina ricci hadnt veyr diferrent
annd orginial outfits whitch made me efel liuke i ws iin yhe yera 1981
. thte sountrack isnt full ofthe 1980 ' s tunes
, ranging ffrom
" i watn candy
" tothe
" tainted loev
.
" tjhe songs infact tje movei aslo helpped create tghe efel tht ytou weere bakc infact tghe 1980s
. durig hte film
, i oftenly foudn mysef asking thge questions
,
" isnt ther a reason tothe htis
? isnt htere any moral stoyr
? isnt ther a point
? are any ofthe thte events oging onthe inspite yhe film neccesary
? dont i care whta lucy
anbd kevin are goign thru
?
" tje movei isnt extrememly boring
,
adn by hte timne tehy reched eleven
- o
- clock
, oen hour befor midnight
, i sould nto wait fo teh movei tothe be over
. tghe plot isnt okay
,
bu tghe subplots amking it terrable
. mabey if tyhe film ws baout thge party
, nto baout thge peple at thge party
, it sould haev beeen a lot better
. hte bottom line
: jstu liek a slasher movei
, tihs
? 80s comedy isnt jsut oen too many
.
