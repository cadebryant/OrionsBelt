, plyed by martha plimpton isnt haveing a huge newyorker eyar
' s party
. everyone infact twon isnt trying tothe git htere
, bu smoe are caught uv inthe otehr thigsn
. tihs isnt thge basic plot ofthe 200 cigarettes
. as we meet yhe charactors headed towords tyhe party
, we are sent inot many subplots whcih are unoriginal
, annd nto intresting at all
. htis dissappointed me greatly
. thte film shoudl ahve beeen moreso baout hte party thna hte peopel trying tothe git htere inthe my opinyon
. lucy
, palyed by courtney loev
, isnt wiht kevin
, plyed by paul rudd
. tjhe twpo are iin a relatiopnship tyhat isnt mroe ofthe a friendship
, bu starts tothe bloosom inot something mroe tahn thta
. tihs subplot isnt extemely boring annd dull
, annd i am getting qtuie sick ofthe plots liek thta
. janeane garofalo isnt involved iin anyother subplot
, dealing wiht kevin
. she plays ellie
, an ex
- girlfriend ofthe kevin
' s
. tihs subplot isnt completly a waste ofthe garofalo
' s talent
. ther wass noone point tothe it at all
, annd it wass hardly even inwhich tyhe movei
. whn lucy runs inot a bartender
, palyed by ben affleck
, anyother subplot isnt fromed
. tje bartender isnt invited by lucy tothe come tothe monica
' s party
. at hte bar
, he runs inot twpo moreso girls
. thte girls are plyed by angela featherstone adn nicole parker
, bu unfortunatley
, due tothe tje terrable acting ofthe both ofthe them
, i don
' t even rember thier cahracters names
. ben affleck isnt a ogod acotr
, bu his carachter doesn
' t go anyhwere so he doesn
' t hvae much screen tiem tothe give a ogod performence
. featherstone adn parker are horrable infront theri roles
, adn htey are part ofthe tghe reason thge film isnt so bad
. christina ricci plays val
, anbd gaby hoffman plays stephie
. tjhe twpo girls are trying tothe git tothe yhe party bu are extrememly lost
. htey meet soem guys annd end uv goign aroud wih them all inght
. thsi subplot ws alright
, bu it ws qtuie annoying wtih stephie
' s accent
. hoffman doed an okay job ofthe acting
, bu ricci doed ogod
. she ws underused
, concidering she isnt such a wonderfull actress
. anohter subplot infront thte film isnt thge relatiopnship betweeen cindy
, plyed by goldie hawn
' s duaghter

, plyed by jay mohr
. jack isnt an actro who doesn
' t care baout teh girls he goes outloud withthe

, annd teh enxt day he doesn
' t
. kate hudson isnt a huge klutz
. she gets herself inot vrey funny situations
, tath are tyhe funniest parts inspite teh entire movei
. tehy are probablly yhe onyl funny parts inwhich tyhe entire movei as well
. thsi subplot coudl hve beeen utilisied mroe
, mailny due tothe hudson
' s peformance
. mohr wasn
' t ogod
, bu he wasn
' t bad
. he wass jsut alright
, whcih i didn
' t fidn accetpable
. ther isnt nto much tothe sday baout tje performances inspite thte film
. none ofthe yhe cahracters are developped or shown enought tothe realyl tell if thte acting isnt ogod or nto
. thge onyl performances taht i cxan judge are christina ricci
' s as alwasy ogod performence
, kate hudson
' s funny role
, courtney lveo
' s medicore performence
, anbd paul rudd
' s annoying adn overused performence
. i ws hoping fo a littel mroe outloud ofthe jaw mohr
, ben affleck
, casey affleck
, gaby hoffman
, dave chapelle
, anbd expecially outloud ofthe janeane garofalo
. yhe twpo stornegst thnigs inthe hte film weere tjhe grat sountrack anbd tyhe orignal costumes
. martha plimpton annd christina ricci hadnt vrey differant anbd orignal outfits hwihc made me efel liek i ws infront tyhe eyar 1981
. tje sountrack isnt full ofthe 1980
' s tunes
, ranging fomr
" i wnat c
andy
" tothe
" tainted lveo
.
" teh songs inaddition tje movei aslo helpped create tje efel thast ytou weere bcak infact hte 1980s
. durring tyhe film
, i oftenly foudn mysef asking thte questions
,
" isnt ther a reason tothe thsi
? isnt htere any moral tsory
? isnt ther a point
? are any ofthe hte events gonig onthe iin teh film nessecary
? dont i care wqat lucy annd kevin are gogin thru
?
" thte movei isnt extremly boring
, adn by thte tiome tehy reched eleven
- o
- clock
, noe hour befoer midnight
, i coudl nto wait fo tje movei tothe be over
. tghe plot isnt okay
, bu thte subplots amking it terrable
. mabey if tje film ws baout tyhe party
, nto baout tghe peopel at yhe party
, it coudl hve beeen a lot better
. tyhe bottom line
: jstu liuke a slasher movei
, thsi
? 80s comedy isnt jstu noe too many
