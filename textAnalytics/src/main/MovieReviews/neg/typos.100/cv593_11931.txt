; how alse cin oney expalin tje graininess ofthe blawp
' s composite shots iwth yhe human actors
? bu inspite donig so
, thge seams are tath much mroe obvious
. yuo haev tothe be severly visually impaired tothe nto be distracted wehn a grainy shooted ofthe penny adn blawp isnt immediatelly folowed by a crystal
