, trys agina
, htis tiem pairing ood nick nolte withthe young julia roberts
. howver
, altough ther isnt soem chemestry beetwen hte twpo
, soon it stops tothe arouse any interst
. it probaly happens due tothe poorly exectued genre mix
, tath collides light
- hearted rumatic comedy wih rether uninteresting plot suitable tothe pure acation thrillers
. shyer as directer fails tothe amke tyhe propper transistion vetween tyhe twpo
