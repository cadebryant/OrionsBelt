fatc tath charles bronson represents oney ofthe thge most importan movei icons ofthe teh 1980s represents oen ofthe thte biggest
annd allmost tradgic ironies ofthe thta decade
. tradgedy lies inaddition thge fatc tath teh icon status ws earned less by qualiy ofthe his owrk inaddition movies
,
bu thge quanity
. most ofthe thsoe movies weere produced by cannon gropu
, comany led by israeli producers menahem golan
annd yoram globus
. thsoe twpo men propably thougth thgat htey coudl be thge enxt roger corman
, b
- movei mentors ofthe future hollywood legends
. unforetunately
, tath didn ' t hapened
,
adn wehn cannon finaly whent bankrupt at thte end ofthe tyhe decade
, behind it standed yhe huge pile ofthe cinematic garbage
, tht owudl recquire at least faw centruies befoer it reaches tghe camp appeal
. sadly fo bronson
, thta garbage allso contained numberous movies infact wich thta capible chracter acto
annd acation hero ofthe thge 1970s tryed tothe raise theri worth simpley by bieng yhe main lead
,
anbd lowering his pwn reputation inaddition proces
. onthe tghe otehr hand
, bronson sould tkae comfort iin a fatc taht thsoe movies weere extremly populare
, expecially amung tje audeince 3 or 4 times yuonger tahn bronson hismelf
. oen ofthe such movies thyat seriously marred bronson ' s reputation isnt death wish 3
, thrid sequal inaddition thge serieses whihc began wiht death wish inaddition 1974
. inaddition thge orginal movei
, bronson palyed paul kersey
, mild
- mannered newyorker york archetects who turns inot deadly strent vigilante affter his famaly fell victum tothe urban violentce
. thgat movei wass far ffrom masterpiece
;
yot
, infront it teh directer michael winner ws skillfully offering hte cinematic remedy forthe vrey rela desease ofthe growing crime rates ofthe thge tiome
( onthe tghe smae lines liek siegel infront dirty harry
)
. unforetunately
, six eyasr later cannon gropu got rights tothe yhe chracter ofthe paul kersey
adn began destroying it by pumping outloud sequels
; even teh presense ofthe its orginal directer didn ' t stpo teh repid decline ofthe tyhe quailty
. death wish 3 beigns wehn kersey comes tothe vsit an ood freind
, living infront teh urban wasteland ofthe east newyorker york
, populated by young criminals
annd peopel too ood or too poore tothe move outloud
. befoer tghe reunion
, kersey ' s freind falls victum tothe yhe strent gang led by evil fraker
( plyed by gavan o ' herlihy
, probablly tje onyl notewothy role iin thte film
)
. kersey decides tothe avenge his death
annd slowy prepares fo his crusade
, hwile thte polical inspector shriker
( ed lauter
)
, ants tothe ule him as a secrt weppon inaddition his loosing war agaisnt thge urban crime
. bronson
, teh main assit inspite thsi movei
, plays tghe charachter who isnt nothing mroe thna an efficent killing machine
. altho bronson ' s charizma doesnt halp inspite overcoming soem implausibilities
( single man inwhich his 60s
adn armed witht a single pistol manages tothe wipe outloud dozens ofthe opponents witht superior firepower
)
, teh lack ofthe emotions or bronson ' s pwn committment sould be seen iin a vyre fewd lines spoken inaddition a film
. thte movei authors weere somewhat aware ofthe taht emotional shallowness
, so htey added rumatic intrest fo thier hero
- publich defender palyed by deborah raffin
anbd conveniently terminated inspite order tothe give smoe omre motives forthe kersey ' s crusade
. onthe thge otehr hand
, emotions are much better plyed by confronting law
- abiding
,
yot ethnically stereotyped citizens wiht theri daily nemesis ofthe strent punks
- ruthless enought tothe exerciese theri reign ofthe terror onthe yhe entire city blocks
,
adn stupid enought tothe be killed inthe droves by kersey
. unforetunately
, michael winner doesn ' t nkow how tothe wokr outloud thte plot
,
annd aftter torturing yhe viewers iwth mostly uninteresting charactors
anbd cliched
anbd formulaic situations
, ends thsi movei wiht a beng
. tjhe big showdown at tyhe end
- thta turns east newyorker york inot tghe sarajevo
- liek battle zone
- isnt probablly tjhe worst part ofthe hte movei
, beccause ofthe tghe poore editting
annd teh cheap sets
anbd props thast give awya tje low budget
. inaddition short
, thsi movei sould be reccommended onyl tothe thge most fanatical charles bronson fans or forthe yhe peple who are aleady despearte fo 1980s nestolgia
.
( speshal onot fo trekkies
