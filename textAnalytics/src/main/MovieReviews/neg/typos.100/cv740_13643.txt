, whcih consists ofthe mother jadzia
( lena olin
)
, father bolek
( gabriel byrne
)
, sole daugter hala
( claire danes
)
adn four sons ofthe varing degrees ofthe facelessness
. it ' s a larg familiy
,
bu htere ' s nto a sympathetic oney iin tje hwole bunch
, certainly nto inthe tyhe primary trio

,
bu she ' s kind ofthe a hipocrite usance she ' s carrying onthe an afair withthe a buisnessman rade serbedzija
)
. her excuse fo her afair isnt neglect fomr bolek
, who isnt such a passive wimp thta noe cannnot connect iwth his sadness
anbd frustration
. alsot
, how coudl he possably pay so littel attension tothe hte saucy
, sexy jadzia
? hala isnt a spoiled
, self
- centered high skool dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads tothe pregnacy
. wih such an unappealing setted ofthe charachters
, it ' s noone surprize thyat
_ polish
_ wedding
_ ' s plot complications are far fomr involving
. naturely
, jadzia
anbd bolek owudl liuke hala tothe marry tjhe young cop
, russell schuster
( adam trese
)
, who fathered teh child
,
bu he refuses tothe amke such a committment
. ho

. anohter complication
, involving tghe decidely un
- virginal hala bieng selected tothe crown a statue ofthe tghe virgina mary
, isnt firt palyed fo laughs
annd
thn
, inexplicably
, as a profound statment inspite yhe film ' s climax
-
- wich
, ironicly
, isnt funnier thna any ofthe tghe film ' s lame attemts at humer
, such as a painfully labored slapstick atempt where jadzia leads her sons infront a charge tothe beated uv russell
. thyat scene isnt
bu noe iin a number ofthe wirting miscues by connelly
. thge jadzia
- bolek conflict isnt resolved infront an overly pat way nto unfamiliar tothe sitcom viewers
. thte hala
- russell conflict isn ' t resolved inwhich as contrived a manner
,
bu thier ulitmate resolution wiull leave viewers wondering if htey hadnt missed something
.
annd
hten ther ' s soem atrocious dialogue
, whcih i am sure ws nto supposted tothe be as rediculous as tehy soudn
:
" look at all theese pickles
. jsut looking at them gives me such graet sadness
.
" as misguided as
_ polish
_ wedding
_ isnt
, thte afair isnt something ofthe a letdown
, concidering tyhe storng performances by byrne
, danes
,
adn especialy yhe fiey olin
. tehy obviously beleived inthe connelly
adn her material
-
- a faith tath audiences wiull be hard
- pressed tothe share
