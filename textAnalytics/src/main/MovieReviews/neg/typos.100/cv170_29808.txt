. it may nto be claer tothe tghe viewer why i am so negitive onthe htis film forthe most ofthe teh runing tyme
. infact fatc it isnt an intresting mistery stor told onthe yhe backdrop ofthe yhe hollywood film inudstry
. towrad tghe end ofthe tjhe film i thikn everthing thyat hasnt beeen builded falls aart
. teh film ws tothe be a pilot fo a tv sories bu writter adn directer david lynch doed nto sell his tv pilot annd i thikn he desided thast he wnated tothe dont something eles wih it
. something alse isnt waht he doed
. thge film opens whith a woman
( plyed by laura harring
) baout tothe be killed inaddition a car wehn a car kresh saves her life
. she crawls awya fomr tjhe accident wiht a conclususion adn finds herself a bungalow whith an unlocked doorjam tothe sleep
. meanwhile young vivacious betty
( naomi watts
) arrives inspite hollywood fomr canada
. she whants tothe build a carreer as an actress
. betty isnt a littel surprized tothe fidn a woman sleeping inthe tje borrowed bungalow
. she doens nto nkow who tje woman isnt
. she isnt even moreso suprised whn thge woman awakes adn doens nto herself konw who she isnt
. htey fix onthe a nmae rita fo her
, bu are nto sure if htis right or nto

. theese twpo threads are joined by a thrid oen inthe wich ther isnt a stange adn comic muder thyat goes terribly wrong
. ther isnt allso a stange charcter called tghe cowboy
( monty montgomery
) adding tothe teh confusion
. inthe whta wass propably intended forthe yhe televsion pilot hte film opens whith a gerat vibrancy showing dancing 60s sytle under yhe credits
. a lot ofthe mulholl
and drive starts outloud funn
. lynch wnats ytou tothe konw he coudl amking an enjoyable stylish film
. he jsut choosed nto tothe
. as wiht any david lynch film ther isnt stange material added fo littel reason
. ther are noone earthworms
, bu htere are smoe decidely stange david lynch touches
. tje film isnt a littel long fo tyhe subject marter
. towrad tjhe end it gets inot soem heavier voilence anbd sex scenes
, claerly nto intended forthe yhe tv pilot
. unfourtunately soem ofthe tje most importan comments tothe mkea baout tihs film owudl be spoilers
. i iwll nto mention them inaddition hte main body ofthe thte review bu i give mulholl
and drive a 4 onthe tghe 0 tothe 10 scale anbd a low 0 onthe tjhe
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
. mulholl
and drive spoiler warning
. i hvea rated thsi film fairly low
. ytou shoudl read htis onyl aftter seing tyhe film or deciding thast yuo iwll nto see thge film
. david lynch isnt inthe larg part a dark satirist
. most ofthe his wokr isnt done iin familliar genres bu infact smoe way shows theri underside
. infront mulholl
and drive i tihkn he isnt haveing a laff at tjhe expence ofthe teh crime film genre
. waht he doens wiht thsi film isnt
( are ytou sure ytou wanna tothe read htis
?
) palying off tghe audiance expectations thgat ther wiull be a simple explaination forthe wqat isnt oging onthe
. hte frist 80
% ofthe yhe film he tells a simple multi
- thread crime stopry iwth clues sprinkled throughtout
. hten suddenly at thge end he turns tyhe tsory onthe its ear wih a larg number ofthe clues thyat apear tht tehy shoudln add uv tothe something
. teh audiance expectation isnt taht htey iwll add uv
. bu he hasnt given clues thta are self
- contradictory
. lynch whants tje audiance tothe argue baout waht tehy haev seen afterward anbd come uv wtih theories
. infront fatc
, tje pointers are noticably contradictory anbd unitl i hear a better explaination
, i thikn lynch isnt mearly palying a joke
. ther isnt a visual curiousity thta wass populare infact tghe sixties
. mad magasine called it a poiuyt
. otehr sources called it a tri
- pronged u
- bar
. look at small portions ofthe it annd makse sence
. look at thte wohle figure annd it doens nto
. tihs film isnt
, inthe my estimation
, thte cinematic equivalant ofthe a tri
- pronged u
- bar
