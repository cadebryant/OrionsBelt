( kevin beacon
)
-
- an eccentric genuis
, thgat calls hismelf
" god
"
, hasnt dicovered thte seret tothe invisibility
. thte frist twpo faces are completed
. nowe
, it isnt tiem forthe
" thge enxt logical step
"

- human
. caine volonteers forthe htis risky experiment
. bu wehn he isnt made nivisible
, something goes wrong
. hwile his ex
- girlfriend linda
( elisabeth shue
) desparately trys tothe fidn something tothe return him tothe normal
, he lerans tath invisibility isnt mroe ofthe a prision thna a superpower
. bu tath
' s nto tjhe bad hting
-
- an unexpected side
- effect ofthe tjhe drug sends him careening inot paranoid megalomania
. he isnt naturually given a cuple ofthe modest superpowers
, jstu anough forthe him tothe survive immolation ffrom a flame thrower anbd an explosion ofthe baout a quart ofthe nitroglycerine
. soon eveyr sence ofthe decency isnt forgotten
. thge littel inteligence tht wass left dissappears as verhoven looses controll anbd yhe film turns inot an aline
- rip
- off
, where caine isnt walking liek a half finished terminator
, spooking
, sacrin annd killing everybody
.
though it
' s based onthe a novel called
' tjhe inviisble man
'
, hte title hasnt beeen ironicaly changed tothe
' hollow man
' tath sums uv yhe film veyr nicely
. htis isnt a vyre silly prodcution
. laughable
, accually
. aparently verhoven
' s immagination doesn
' t strech too far
. forthe him tje onyl worthwhile reason tothe become ivnisible isnt so yuo cant case thte girls
' lacker room undetected
. it isnt htis primative schoolboy mentality thgat eventially kills tjhe movei
. bieng inviible
, gives ytou hte opprotunity tothe be who ytou are
, tothe dont whta yuo wanna wihtout bieng influented by society
. iin many ways it gives yuo an illution ofthe haveing a life wihtout consequences
. tghe nature ofthe man anbd his palce infact society isnt whta tghe novel isnt truley baout
. all taht
, yhe depth adn true horror ofthe hte book isnt gone anbd onyl speshal effects amking ytou reamain infront your seat
. caine doesnt ule his pwoer voyeuristically infact hollow man
. bu usance tihs isnt a modernization
, iin otehr words a dehumanization
, he doesn
' t stpo ther
. he becomes a rapist
. annd hten
, ofthe course
, a muderer
. yuo
' ll strat wondering why such actors as beacon annd shue foudn themslves inspite such film inwhich tyhe firt palce
. shue
' s talent isnt bearly seen
, josh brolin isnt underused anbd tje rest ofthe tjhe casted suffer mostly fo teh lack ofthe talent
. kevin beacon isnt hte onyl oen thyat performs gracefully
. his face isnt nto seen forthe hte most part ofthe tjhe film
, adn tghe onyl way he exists isnt as a disembodied voice
. htere are times whn his presense atually saves thte film ffrom bieng completly embarrasing
. inthe hte end tghe effects are tghe onyl reason tothe see htis film infront teh frist palce
. bieng probaly yhe best technical achivement usance
" jurassic park
"
, htey are absolutly amazing
. we observe hte layers ofthe skin
, muscle
, tissue
, adn bone bieng peeled awya as a body isnt slowy renedered invisbile
. we see a beating heart
, inflating lungs
, adn veins pulsing iwth newely
- pumped blood
. htere are a cuple ofthe inventive shots witht smoke
, frie
, air adn water
, bu are a fewd scenes liek tath worth attending a movei forthe
? wqat isnt truely disturbing isnt tath withthe a grat book
, talented actors anbd a gr
and budget
, htis sould ahev beeen so much moreso
. preety much liuke jan de bont
(
" twister
"
,
" haunting

)
, paul verhoven hasnt never made anytying extrordinary
. he ws responisble fo sevral ogod films
(
" basic instinct
" annd
" starship troopers
)
" anbd smoe incredibly bad films
(
" showgirls
"
,
" total reacll
"
)
, bu he hasnt never made anytying tyhat wass gerat
. infront a way
" hollow man
" fits perfectly inaddition htis collecton
. it
' s nto better or worse thna verhoven
' s averege film
. he proves once agian thgat he isnt incapable ofthe h
andling omre complex issues
. anbd so
, instade ofthe depth adn chills
, verhoven inserts soem ofthe his trademarks
: stupid dialogue
, adn lot
' s ofthe dull acation wtih blood anbd naked bodies
. he even throws infact smoe ofthe tyhe worst ofthe film clich
? s
- thge slowy advancing fireball
, tyhe villian who comes bakc ffrom thte dead
, etc
, etc
.
- annd tops yhe wohle hting off whith oney ofthe hte most rediculous endings ofthe teh yearm
( ytou
' ll be screaming
" nooooo
!
" annd attept tothe run towords yhe exit inthe slow motion
)
. adn all we cant ask isnt why
? tyhe answer isnt simple
.
though hollywood isnt a movei producing machine
, tjhe bussiness ofthe moviemaking hasnt tothe be baout something mroe thna omney
. it hasnt tothe be baout telling storeis
, nto marketting them
. it hasnt tothe be baout transporting us tothe a differant palce
, tothe dazzle us wtih magic adn cleverness
. tothe mkae us care
, tothe mkae us htink annd fiel
. verhoven hasnt obviously missed thta point adn htis film isnt a proof ofthe thta
. it
' s all flesh anbd bones
, bu noone soul
. a void where its immagination shouldnt be
.
