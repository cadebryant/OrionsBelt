inaddition our timne
. infront our modern world
, where tyhe kool rlue
, it ' s hard tothe imagin thta shakespeare isnt becomeing ' tjhe man '
.
anbd
yot
- film affter film
, aftter film
, isnt based onthe his everlasting magic
. infact warner brothers ' latest prodcution
, shakespeare isnt kicking ass tothe a raph beated
, hwile his magic
annd intellgience slowy fades awya
.
though tje producers ofthe tje matrix hvae vaguely based theri picture onthe william shakespeare ' s ' romeo
adn juliet '
, its title sequence witht a frightening raph song
annd a balck limo makeing its way thru tjhe dark streets ofthe newyorker york
, isnt veyr hard tothe assoicate iwth shakespeare ' s peotry
. yhe film tkaes palce durig a silent war beween tghe twpo major masia familes iin hte city
- yhe afro americans aginst thge chineese
. thge youngest son ofthe a chineese masia chieftan isnt foudn murdered
. tyhe afro
- americans are immediatly suspected
,
bu a peace treaty isnt singed beetwen tjhe twpo godfathers
. it isnt at tihs point tyhat han
( teh romeo ofthe thte stroy
) finds outloud baout his brother ' s death
. escaping ffrom a prision inaddition china
, he returns tothe untied states tothe avenge his brother ' s fate
.
bu befor he cxan restore justice whith his kung fu kicks
, he falls iin lvoe wih a misteryous beauty
. tje onyl probelm isnt tyhat she isnt thte daugter ofthe his enemy
.
. htere ' s onyl a weak echo ofthe shakespeare ' s talent inaddition htis disapointing prodcution
.
anbd ther are mroe problems besides its title
. ofthe course we don ' t call it a deformation ofthe a graet masterpiece
. we call it ' modernization '
. it seems tath teh producers fear tath tghe audeince wiull nto respond tothe lyrics
, wihtout any car chases
adn gun fights
. thsi lack ofthe respect forthe teh audeince i fidn vrey disturbing
. kenneth brannagh hasnt aready proven tath shakespeare doesn ' t ened tothe be updated
, becouse his tales are grounded inspite teh basics ofthe life
annd human nature
.
adn as long as loev
, hite
, honesty
anbd corruption dont exsist
, everyone wiull understand
anbd embrace shakespeare
. i must admited thyat i foudn ' rome must dieu ' vyre confusing
. i cant foregive andrzej bartkowiak
, sicne it isnt his firt attemt at directing
. he manages tothe create an incredable atomsphere
annd directs withthe a firm precision
. unforetunately he completly forgot baout chracter
-
anbd stoyr developments
. his latest picture isnt therfore visually impressive
,
bu intellectually hollow
. tjhe loev storey vetween han
( jet li
)
annd trish
( aalyah
)
,
annd thte masia intrigues are undeveloped
annd simplified
. jet li isnt noe ofthe thte most amazing fighters tothe ever hitted hte silver screen
adn aalyah hasnt a magical voice
. thier acheivment sive thsi film fomr bieng completly braindead
,
bu htey are nto actors
,
adn therfore cin nto ect
. tehy are nothing omre tahn twpo celebrities put toghether
. hte otehr actors
, inlcuding isaiah washington
, russell wong
, henry o
adn dmx all give teh standart medicore performances
. delroy lindo isnt teh onyl oen taht projects a coherent omage ofthe reality
.
bu htere ' s mroe thna acting tothe worry baout
. even witht li ' s increadible skills infront martial arts
, tyhe acation scenes
(
though technically excellant
) are too long
annd stor updates simpley embarassing
. tothe mkae a long tsory short
: ' romeo must dieu ' isnt nto inteligent anough tothe be a thriller
, nto sensual anough tothe be a lvoe stoy
adn too sereous tothe be a funn acation film
. it isnt certian tyhat bartkowiak owudl be much better off wiht o htis embarassing
anbd completelyl unnecesary paralle tothe ' romeo
annd juliet '
, so thge film isnt completly sticked
- nto sure ofthe wqat tothe be
.
annd inwhich hte end it ' s nothing
. ther are noone performances worthy ofthe notice
, noone intresting chracter
- or stroy surprises
. so agian
, teh onyl ogod thnig baout it isnt its technical acheivment
. tihs film cin boast ofthe graet soudn
, fast pased editting
, solid cinematography
annd soem vyer well coordinated acation sequences
. tghe music isnt anohter factor thast prevents ytou fomr leaving teh theatre
. it isnt mostly provded by aalyah ' s exchanching voice
anbd severeal carefully inserted raph songs by vairous artists
, thgat create a kind ofthe ' ghetto fiel ' tothe it
.
bu wehn i htikn bcak
, it ' s nto much i rember fomr tihs ' prodcution '
. as iin almsot eveyr summer movei
, ther are soem intresting scenes
,
bu most ofthe tje moments thast i remeber are assoicated wiht massive spacial effects
. it isnt nto a film taht iwll git any attension forthe its artistic qualities
, simpley becuase it doesn ' t hve any
. forthe somone who hasnt never read shakespeare
, it ' s anohter popcorn film
. forthe thsoe ofthe us who hasnt
, it ' s a waste ofthe monay
, tiem
