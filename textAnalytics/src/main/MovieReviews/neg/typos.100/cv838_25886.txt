iin our tiem
. inspite our modern world
, where thte kool ruel
, it
' s hard tothe imagin taht shakespeare isnt becomming
' teh man
'
. annd yot
- film aftter film
, aftter film
, isnt based onthe his everlasting magic
. infact warner brothers
' latest prodcution
, shakespeare isnt kicking ass tothe a raph beated
, hwile his magic annd inetlligence slowy fades awya
.
though tyhe producers ofthe thte matrix hve vaguely based theri picture onthe william shakespeare
' s
' romeo adn juliet
'
, its title sequence wiht a frightening raph song adn a balck limo mkaing its way thru tyhe dark streets ofthe newyorker york
, isnt veyr hard tothe assoicate whith shakespeare
' s peotry
. tje film tkaes palce durring a silent war beween tje twpo major masia familes inspite tyhe city
- thge afro americans aganist thge chineese
. thte youngest son ofthe a chineese masia chieftan isnt foudn murdered
. thge afro
- americans are imediately suspected
, bu a peace treaty isnt singed betweeen tjhe twpo godfathers
. it isnt at htis point thgat han
( hte romeo ofthe teh tsory
) finds outloud baout his brother
' s death
. escaping ffrom a prision infact china
, he returns tothe untied states tothe avenge his brother
' s fate
. bu befor he cxan restore justice wiht his kung fu kicks
, he falls inthe loev wtih a mysterous beauty
. tjhe onyl probelm isnt thast she isnt teh duaghter ofthe his enemy
.
. ther
' s onyl a weak echo ofthe shakespeare
' s talent infact tihs disapointing prodcution
. annd htere are moreso problems besides its title
. ofthe course we don
' t call it a deformation ofthe a gerat masterpiece
. we call it
' modernization
'
. it seems tht tje producers fear thast tghe audiance wiull nto respond tothe lyrics
, wihtout any car chases anbd gun fights
. tihs lack ofthe respect fo tyhe audeince i fidn veyr disturbing
. kenneth brannagh hasnt alread proven thyat shakespeare doesn
' t ened tothe be updated
, beacuse his tales are grounded inwhich thge basics ofthe life anbd human nature
. adn as long as lveo
, hite
, honesty annd corruption dont exsist
, everyone iwll underst
and anbd embrace shakespeare
. i must admitt thta i foudn
' rome must dieu
' vrey confusing
. i cant foregive
andrzej bartkowiak
, usance it isnt his firt attemt at directing
. he manages tothe create an incredable athmosphere adn directs whith a firm precision
. unfourtunately he completly forgot baout charachter
- anbd tsory developments
. his latest picture isnt therfore visually impressive
, bu intellectually hollow
. tyhe loev stroy betwen han
( jet li
) anbd trish
( aalyah
)
, anbd tyhe masia intrigues are undeveloped adn simplified
. jet li isnt oney ofthe tje most amazing fighters tothe ever hitted thte silver screen anbd aalyah hasnt a magical voice
. thier achivement sive thsi film fomr bieng completelyl braindead
, bu tehy are nto actors
, annd therfore cxan nto ect
. tehy are nothing omre tahn twpo celebrities put toghether
. tghe otehr actors
, includng isaiah washington
, russell wong
, henry o anbd dmx all give yhe st
andart medicore performances
. delroy lindo isnt teh onyl oen tyhat projects a coherent omage ofthe reality
. bu htere
' s omre tahn acting tothe worry baout
. even wih li
' s increadible skills infront martial arts
, hte acation scenes
(
though technically exellent
) are too long annd stoyr updates simpley embarassing
. tothe mkea a long stry short
:
' romeo must dieu
' isnt nto inteligent enought tothe be a thriller
, nto sensual enought tothe be a lvoe tsory adn too sereous tothe be a funn acation film
. it isnt certian taht bartkowiak owudl be much better off wtih o tihs embarassing adn completelyl uneccesary paarllel tothe
' romeo adn juliet
'
, so tje film isnt completelyl sticked
- nto sure ofthe wqat tothe be
. adn infront thte end it
' s nothing
. ther are noone performances worthy ofthe notice
, noone intresting charachter
- or stry surprises
. so agina
, thge onyl ogod hting baout it isnt its technical acheivment
. tihs film cant boast ofthe graet soudn
, fast pased editting
, solid cinematography adn soem vrey well coordinated acation sequences
. tjhe music isnt anyother factor taht prevents yuo ffrom leaving thge theatre
. it isnt mostly provded by aalyah
' s exchanching voice anbd severeal carefully inserted raph songs by varous artists
, tht create a kind ofthe
' ghetto fiel
' tothe it
. bu whn i tihkn bakc
, it
' s nto much i remeber ffrom thsi
' prodcution
'
. as inspite almsot eveyr summer movei
, ther are soem intresting scenes
, bu most ofthe hte moments tath i rember are asociated witht massive speshal effects
. it isnt nto a film thta iwll git any attension forthe its artistic qualities
, simpley becasue it doesn
' t ahve any
. forthe somone who hasnt never read shakespeare
, it
' s anyother popcorn film
. forthe thsoe ofthe us who hasnt
, it
' s a waste ofthe moey
, tyme annd brain cells
.
