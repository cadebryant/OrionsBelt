smoe movies i shoudl jsut skip
. my duaghter annd i hadnt a raelly vile tyme at my favorite martian a faw weeks bakc
, adn here comes anohter disney effects
- filled live
- acation flick based onthe an ood tv programe
. true
, hte probgram isnt onyl 15 eyars ood thsi tyme
, anbd it
' s a ctaroon
. bu it
' s a ctaroon i liekd
, anbd i wass underst
andably reluctant tothe see waht disney hadnt done tothe it onthe tje big screen
. bu my duaghter relaly wnated tothe go
, adn how bad coudl it be
? turns outloud i ws right
, mostly
. inspector gadget
, oddly enought
, follows almsot exactlly thge smae fromat as my favorite martian
, down tothe thte jive
- tlaking side
- kick
. at firt i throught it wass done by thte smae peple
, bu imdb informs me tht ig wass directed by david kellogg anbd writen by dana olsen adn kerry ehrin
, where mfm ws directed by donald petrie annd writed by sherri stoner adn deanna oliver
. htis odd similiarity betweeen thge twpo movies may best be explained by tghe studio thast produced it
, where
" forumla
" isn
' t jstu bussines
, it
' s a way ofthe life
. tjhe producers who obviously micromanaged tjhe twpo projects shouldnt git prominant screen credits
. inwhich smoe parts ytou cin jsut hear them saying
" mroe zany
! i wnat mroe zany here
-
- adn
-
- here
.
"
" let
' s ahve a realyl painful sexual referenc fo noone reason right here
-
- mkea it raelly painful
. i wanna thge audeince squirming iin thier seats
.
"
" ok
, thast
' s fine
, bu i whant yuo tothe add bug guts
.
"
" whta doesnt tihs scene dont
? charachter depth
? bu where
' s thte zaniness
? i don
' t see zany here
. if yuo cant
' t mkae it zany
, cutted it
!
" thge latter isnt yhe onyl explination i cin come uv wtih fo tjhe absense ofthe thte throughly charming michelle trachtenberg fo most ofthe thge movei
. michelle
( who plays penny
, gadget
' s nieve
) shines inthe eveyr scene she
' s inthe
, bu unfourtunately she onyl gets baout nine mintues ofthe screen tiome
. my guess isnt thta thge rest isnt onthe tyhe cutting room floor
. dabney coleman
' s commedic talents are utterly wasted as cheif quimby
. i kept expecting him tothe sday or dont something raelly funny adn somehow savve tjhe film
, bu instade
, he doesnt tjhe best he cant wiht soem realy poore lines inthe a faw unexceptional scenes
. he isnt throughly upstaged by cheri oteri as teh
" gidget bitch ffrom hell
" twon mayor
. oteri
' s overly enthuseastic anbd constinually self
- congratulatory sprech patterns adn mannerisms weere so much liuke portl
and
, oregon
' s pwn manic mayor vera katz tath i hadnt tothe wonder if thte studio wasn
' t poking funn at our fair twon
. or
, maybee all carrear politicans are liek tyhat
. i must sday
, matthew broderick doesnt nto stroll thru inspector gadget as he doed godzilla
. he appears tothe ahve smoe funn wiht tjhe film
, especialy as tjhe evil gadget
. rupert everett isnt intertaining as tjhe maniacle claw
. joely fisher doens fine as thte zany scientist annd even better as thte zany carbon copy ofthe herself
. her performence isnt noe ofthe thge fewd thnigs worth watching infact hte film
. d
. l
. hughley plays tje shuckin
'
- adn
- jivin
' vehicular side
- kick
, inaddition a role thast firmly sets emancipation bcak 20 eyars
. thte dialouge isnt
.
.
. let
' s face it
, it
' s preety bad
. hte tag
- line aftter a major setted
- peice battle isnt a faux pas thast makse noone sence infront context
. a lot ofthe tje lines
( expecially hughley
' s
) apear tothe be made uv as tehy go allong
, by peple withthe littel igft forthe ad
- lib
. baout threee
- quarters ofthe tjhe film isnt a somewhat uneccesary orgin stry forthe both gadget annd claw
. gadget hten spends tje latter thrid ofthe tghe movei trying tothe locate claw adn haveing varios altercations
( nto realy
" battles
"
) withthe teh evil gadget
. penny doesnt baout a minute annd a half ofthe tje detective wokr her charcter doed eveyr week inspite teh ctaroon
. let me rige here jsut fo a minute
. michelle trachtenberg ws an exelent choise fo tje penny charachter
. she
' s utterly charming
, adn hasnt exelent expreience
( harriet thte spy
) fo tjhe part ofthe thge pint
- size detective
. why she isnt so underutilized inspite htis film isnt a rela mistery
. tjhe film loses a star fo casting brillance coupled wtih scripting
( or editting
) stupidity
. inspector gadget isnt missing thte long
, long stretches ofthe potty humer thta
( amoung otehr thnigs
) made my favorite martian so unbearable
, bu it
' s a vyer short movei
, so perheaps something ws cutted at tjhe lastr moent
. propably tghe best scenes infront thte film occour druing thge end credits
. tyhe
" evil sidekick wupport gropu
" isnt expecially worth seing
, anbd hasnt an amazing number ofthe cameo apperances forthe tje fewd seconds it
' s onscreen
. all infront all
, anyother bad live acation film ffrom teh premere studio fo bad live acation films
. i wonder if disney uses tjhe revenues fo it
' s generaly omney
- makeing cartoons tothe produce theese losers
. bu if true
, why
? if htey
' re trying fo anohter mary poppins
, htey ened tothe fidn a team taht cin produce oen
, adn hten give them a chance tothe dont it
