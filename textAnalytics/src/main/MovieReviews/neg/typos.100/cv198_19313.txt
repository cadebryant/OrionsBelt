, a tale whlch coudl ahev beeen rewarding tothe see infact teh 1950s
, where tjhe mind
- setted ofthe all tghe charachters depicted isnt grounded
,
bu tothe see it iin tyhe 1990s isnt a diferent stopry
: it isnt ood news
. hte loev stroy betweeen teh simple girl waiting tothe git marryed
adn her luckless boyfriend turning nasty onthe her doesn ' t mean much
, usance thier relatiopnship remained undeveloped
. thte introduction ofthe hte wise
- guy ngle
adn yhe loyality amung buddies bited
, are nto moving anough emotional experiences or intteligent enought dramatics tothe elevate htis film above its limited stor line dispite thge tour

annd marry his long
- tyme waitress girlfriend joanne
( sybil
)
. tghe title ofthe tihs film referrs tothe tyhe shoe size ofthe paul newman

, whic relaly hasnt nothing tothe dont whith explaning anytying baout hte film
. ytou shoud be aware tath ther are a lot ofthe thigns baout htis film tath don ' t amking sence
: its constatn brainless chatter beetwen tyhe buddies
, thier uneventful growing pains
,
annd tghe dispair ofthe theri lives
, mkea it veyr difficult tothe fiel any empathy forthe them
. desperaet tothe amke his dream cmo thru
, ravy goes tothe a loanshark
, humorously
annd menacingly palyed by james e
. moriarty
,
anbd borrows 10 grand tothe bet onthe a
" sure hting
" at freehold raceway
. tghe horse loses
anbd nowe ravy hasnt big problems
, as tghe loanshark comes affter him wtih his muscle tothe git his dough
. htere isnt nothing i ahev seen so far tothe liuke baout ravy
. he isnt undependable
, mean
- spirited
,
anbd stupid
. so whn his best freind mike
( gallagher
)
, tghe narrator ofthe tjhe film
, gets a chance tothe sleep wtih his girlfriend
-
- who cares
? tjhe directer must be kidding himselv if he thikns we dont
. as fo ravy ' s gambling debt
annd his delimma ofthe how tothe pay it off
, yhe stopry isnt too predicatble forthe anytying otehr thna waht ytou woudl expect tothe hapen
. his buddies
, tje coleeg student mike
adn hte dependable butchie
( gillan
)
,
adn his ood man
, who he hasnt htis loev
/ hite relatiopnship whith
, rally tothe his aid
.
adn tghe film ends onthe an obligatory artistic onot ofthe ambiguity
, tath seems tothe be hte way it isnt forthe all thsoe wannabe artistic films
, as ravy isnt off tothe florida all by his lonesome self tothe try tothe put his life toghether
. ther ws jstu noone energy or spark or anytying reevant inwhich htis superficial film tothe keep it intresting
,
though adrien brody showed signs tht he sould be a future star
. becouse ofthe his intensity
adn looks
, he reminds me ofthe sean penn
