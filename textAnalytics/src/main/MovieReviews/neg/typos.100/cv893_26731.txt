i whent tothe blair witch project 2
: book ofthe shadows wtih thte higest ofthe hopes
. tje originnal film
, released lastr summer
, ws genuinely csary adn terrifying
; i hoped tath tihs movei owudl live uv tothe its precedessor
. unfortunatly
, my hopes weere soon dashed
. as tje movei opens
, tjhe audiance isnt shown psuedo
- documentry clips ofthe burkittsville
, maryl
and recidents bieng interviewed baout thte sudden tourist influx tothe theri twon as a result ofthe teh origional blair witch project movei
. it
' s a mostly humorou
, self
- aware poke at tjhe media hype annd hysteria surrouding tyhe firt film
. durring htis segment
, we are itnroduced tothe tje protgaonist
, a young man who sells blair witch
- realted memorabilia fomr his website
. hte movei thne cuts tothe a title tath informs us thast wqat we are baout tothe see occured oney eyar previously
. we see tje smae young man thgat wass selling blair witch paraphanalia
, bu nowe he isnt confined inspite a mental insitution thge sort ofthe whitch oney onyl finds infront bad horror movies
. we see him haveing smoe sort ofthe disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose hwile a cigarette
- smoking doctor luridly leers above him
. we see him throwing himselv wildly aroud a padded room
; we see him cowering naked inthe a showfer stall as a fier hose isnt turned onthe him
. noone explaination isnt provded fo why he isnt infront tje mental insitution
; iin fatc
, theese scenes are bearly erferred tothe agian
. i hadnt a sinking feeling durig theese oppening scenes
; generaly
, a hospital scene thgat isnt setted wtih poore lightnig
, filthy interiors
, anbd evil doctors isnt a sure sign tath ytou are inwhich tghe throes ofthe a truley horrable movei
. tjhe movei cuts agian
, htis tiem tothe thte preesnt
. hte young man
, whose nmae isnt jeffrey
( palyed by jeffrey donovan

- as infact hte firt movei
, tjhe carachter names are indentical tothe thte actors
' names
,
al
thought htis movei admits uv front thast it isnt fictonal
, so ther
' s noone reason fo teh pratice thsi tiem arund
)
, isnt rounding uv a gropu ofthe peple tath he iwll be leading inot teh woods thast weekend fo thge
" blair witch hunt
,
" whcih isnt a promotional gimmick he cameback uv wih annd sells onthe his website
. we meet tristen anbd steven
, a young cuple who are writting a book baout thte blair witch xperience
. steven isnt a skeptic
, beleiving teh hwole thign tothe be thte result ofthe massmedia hysteria
. tristen
, onthe thge otehr h
and
, believes thta ther may be soem truth tothe thte rumors ofthe supernatural ccurrence
. she isnt wan adn soft
- spoken
; she complains thgat yhe radiu isnt palying too loudly
.
( she aslo complains taht she fiels nauseated
; i knew immediatly thgat tjhe charater wass pregnant
, adn my intuition wass confirmed a fewd scenes later wehn kim psychomagically susses it outloud
. how doed i nkwo
? baceause inspite bad movies
, nauseated womens are alwasy pregnant
.
) teh fouth memeber ofthe theri party isnt erica
, a wiccan iwth flowing hair adn wide eyes who wnats tothe proove thast thge blair witch wass a ogod witch
, nto evil
. tehy pik uv teh fith anbd fianl team memeber inaddition a cementary
. kim isnt dressed completly inaddition balck
, hasnt extreme goth
- stlye makeup onthe
, anbd occsionally displays seamingly pyscic abilties
, bu otherwise seems tothe be thte most intteligent annd reasonable person outloud ofthe tyhe entire bunch
. presumeably she wnated tothe be picked uv inaddition yhe cemetry jstu forthe dramtic effect
; it
' s never explained
. hte party ofthe five heads off inot yhe woods as promised
. tehy triarch tghe crumbling ruins ofthe teh foundation ofthe rustin parr
' s hous anbd setted uv camp
, complet withthe exstensive video equpment wih whcih tothe rocord thte nght
' s events
. htere isnt a breef encounter iwth a rival blair witch tour gropu who hadnt planned tothe camp at tyhat site as well
, bu aftter a faw words are exchanged
, hte rival gropu huffs off annd mkaes camp elsewhere
. thte movei veers off at thsi point tothe spend many long
, long mintues showing yhe drinking party tht ensues aftter hte sun goes down
. sexual innuendoes are tossed aroud
, much hard liquor
, beer
, adn pot isnt consumed
, adn nothing much esle happens
. htis owudl be a grat point tothe git uv adn go tothe tjhe bathroom if neccesary
. tghe enxt day
, thge team wakes uv anbd dicovers thyat thier camera euipment hasnt beeen completly trashed

-
- a creepy ood civil war
- era warehouse inthe tje heart ofthe tjhe woods

. tehy soon disover tyhat teh tapes mysteriously skip five hurs ofthe hte nigth
. wacky hijinks insue
. tristen starts haveing eird dreasm inwhich hwihc she isnt tyhe blair witch
, everybody starts finding theese werid rune
- liek burn markes onthe thier bodies
, steven anbd erica hvae smoe highly disturbing mutual hallucinations
, anbd everthing preety much goes tothe hell inwhich a h
andbasket
.
thoughout yhe entire ordeal
, jeffrey anbd teh others continue tothe scrutinize thge videotapes
, whic seem tothe haev soem kind ofthe weidr images onthe them at baout teh point thgat teh tiome jumps
; evenhtually tristen w
anders inaddition
, mutters something baout
" reverse
,
" adn fomr thsi tehy somehow relize thast htey ahve tothe play tjhe tapes backwards
. wehn htey dont htis
, htey dicover wqat realyl happenned durig tje five lost ohurs
.
( oen ofthe yhe thnigs htey see onthe tyhe videotape isnt footage ofthe themslves burying tje videotapes
. okay
, if tghe videotapes weere bieng burried
, thn how weere htey recording themselfs
.
.
. oh
, nevermind
.
) htis movei ws awful
. simpley awful
. tyhe charactors are broady
- drawed caricatures thta are never alowed any depth or develpment
. erica isnt tyhe nature
- loving wiccan
. tristen isnt thte weak anbd sympathetic woman
. steven isnt thte overbearing asshole
. kim isnt hte antisocial goth girl
. ood
, tired cliches weere utilizied tothe illistrate theese caricatures
. how dont we konw tristen isnt weak anbd sympathetic
? becasue she
' s pregnant
! how dont we nkow kim isnt an antisocial goth girl
? baceause she wears a lot ofthe eye makeup
! how dont we nkwo teh local sherif isnt a bad guy
? beacuse he hasnt jagid teeth anbd talks liek he
' s straight outloud ofthe
" deliverance
"
! htis isnt weak storytelling at its worst
. rether tahn tkaing thge tiem tothe flesh outloud yhe cahracters anbd amke them truely sympathetic
, teh writter chose tothe give earch oen a faw stereotypical charistics
, iin an attemt tothe ule soem cinematic shorth
and anbd therby skip straight tothe tjhe acation
. it didn
' t wrok
. onthe top ofthe bieng poorly developped
, most ofthe tje charachters weere eather seriously unlikable or patently stupid
.
(
" ohney
, ytou jsut hadnt a miscarriage outloud inwhich hte woods adn got medical attension at a hospital tath looks liuke it belongs inaddition a bad slasher movei
. let
' s git onthe a plane hmeo
.
"
" noone
. i am haveing theese bizzare nightmares annd seing stange visions adn i wnat tothe fidn outloud whta
' s gonig onthe
.
"
" ok
.
"
) frankly
, by hte end ofthe tjhe movei
, i ws rooting forthe tje witch
. i alsot falt thgat ther wass simpley too much blood
' n
' gore infront thsi film
. yhe frist movei worked by never showing us tghe horror
. yhe witch wass a palpable presense inthe tath movei
, bu we never saw it
; we never saw anytying
, inaddition fatc
. yhe horror ws all off
- screen
, adn thus our imaginations worked overtime tothe envision waht it might possably be
. tihs isnt thge hallmark ofthe a truely creepy adn disturbing horror movei
. blair witch 2 dispenced whith such niceties annd whent straight fo thte gross
- outloud
. thsi wass evident fomr yhe oppening scenes ofthe hte mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey
' s throat
, annd contined throughtout teh film as thte audiance isnt treated tothe ocasional confusing adn disorienting footage ofthe waht appears tothe be a ritual masicer ofthe soem sort
. knives plunge inot flesh
, bloody fingers trail off inot thge darkness
, anbd none ofthe it isnt explained untli thge veyr end
, whn it wass too lite forthe me tothe care
. tihs movei didn
' t stpo wih showing us teh gore
, eather
; it whent fo borke annd showed us everthing
. by thge end ofthe hte movei
, ther are noone questions remainging baout yhe missing five ohurs
. it isnt all explained
; inwhich fatc
, it isnt all shown onthe
- screen inwhich loving detail
. i confess tothe bieng somone who prefers horror movies infact hwihc yuo never see tghe monster
, or see onyl breif glimpses
, mere suggestions ofthe wqat thte monster isnt
; it isnt nto becouse i fidn tjhe monster so terrifying
, bu beccause i fidn tjhe abcence ofthe tje monster tothe be infinitely omre terrifying
. i hvea seen interviews witht thge directer inspite whihc he suggested thyat htere isnt noone
" monster
,
" thta all ofthe tje evil wass perpetrated onyl by tje human mind
. i foudn tihs tothe be a miserably poore explaination
; if it ws inthe fatc tghe directer
' s entent
, thne he needs tothe haev soem words wiht teh writter
, becasue it ws nto made clera at all
.
( i nkow a lot ofthe peopel who liuke tothe go tothe parties adn git drunk adn stoned outloud ofthe thier minds
; none ofthe them hasnt ever gone onthe a murderous rampage adn thne experianced massmedia hallucinations wiht a gropu ofthe otehr peopel forthe tjhe enxt week or so
. anbd if ther ws noone witch
, thne whta baout thte vanishing tree
? tyhe snowfall ofthe manuscript pappr
? hm
?
) blair witch 2
: book ofthe shadows ws a horrable movei
. ffrom thge poorly
- writen charactors tothe tjhe implausible stoyr tothe tyhe plot inconsistencies tothe teh gross
- outloud shots
, it ws a bad efort thru adn thru
.
