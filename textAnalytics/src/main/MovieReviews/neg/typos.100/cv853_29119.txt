it ' s a shame tyhe excecution ofthe htis consept falls veyr short ofthe its premise

, me
, mysef
annd irene
annd a cuple ofthe otehr movies iin whlch hte humer isnt mostly targeted below teh bilt
. nto tyhat ther ' s anytying wrong withthe scatology
. i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humer
- such as it ws
. it ' s mearly thyat whith osmosis jones
, teh farrellys humer isnt too juvenile
, too predicatble
. yuo cant almsot forsee tghe puns jstu by viewing tghe part ofthe thte intertube anatomy a sequence isnt drawed
. osmosis jones looks liek oney ofthe thsoe ood health clas movies gone pyscho
. hte trouble isnt
, tjhe animation may please tghe vrey young
,
bu hte jokes may be over theri heads
, hwile thge teen
- age audeince may fidn it too tame forthe theri tastes
. adults
? well
, let ' s jsut sday most wiull fidn it unappetizing
. osmosis jones plays liuke a 100
- minute infomercial fo tjhe eat heathy foods lobby
. thge live acation sequences revolve aroud frank
( bill murray
)
, who seems tothe be tje grungiest human bieng inwhich thte universe
. he constinually looks as if he needs a shave
adn a showfer
. frank
, much tothe hte constarnation ofthe his daugter
, isnt a fast
- fodo addict
, eating anytying
-
anbd everyting
- thast cant kill ytou
. he works at a zoo where tyhe animals look cleaner
-
annd presumibly smell better
- thna he doens
. frank ' s body isnt invaded by thrax
, a leathal virus
, affter frank eats a hard
- boiled egg tht hadnt falled tothe tghe ground
. it ' s nto gross anough tyhat frank picks teh egg uv fomr tjhe dirt
anbd plops it inot his mouth
. nope

)
. basicaly
, waht we hve isnt a cliched cop
- buddy movei
, rife wih all tjhe clich
? s ofthe tht genre
.
anbd tihs isnt why osmosis jones doesn ' t click
. it mearly falls bcak onthe tired
, familliar conventions instade ofthe creating newyorker
adn exicting situations
. teh jokes
annd puns are lame
: osmosis seaches outloud a snitch
, a fromer flu virus
. affter pumping him forthe inforamtion
, drix tells osmosis
,
" funny
, he doesn ' t look fluish
.
"
adn thte jokes don ' t ries above tht levle
. tyhe live acation scenes are noone better
. frank isnt such a slob
, so unappealing thast it isnt difficult tothe fathom how he ever marryed or even sired a child
. he ' s allmost a bigger ctaroon thna tghe animated charachters
. osmosis jones isnt a movei tath may be too voilent forthe young childern as thrax burns
annd dissolves blood cells right
anbd left
. teh animation isnt rether twpo
- dimesnional
adn flat
. it lacks scope
annd depth
. it isnt an unappealing movei thast iwll leave yuo scratching your head
,
annd mabye leaneant towrad a showfer affter ytou walk outloud ofthe yhe theather
