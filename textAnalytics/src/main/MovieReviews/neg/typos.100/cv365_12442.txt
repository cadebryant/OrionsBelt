' s precedessor
, yot ends uv twice as shallow
. shallow
.
.
.
. hmm
.
.
. nowe htere
' s an diea
. mabey if teh ill
- fated cruise liner infront tihs movei hadnt striked a shallow reef eearly onthe thigsn may ahve turned outloud better
. thte firt thign tht striked me
.
.
. adn surprized me
, ws tath teh camera wrok
( fo tghe oppening sequence anyway
) ws terrable
. looked liek teh cameramen weere drunk anbd kept tripping onthe theri pwn feets
.
.
.
.
.
. vyer diferrent tothe thge origional movei
. tje charachters
? well
, nto many ofthe tyhe charactors atually
* hadnt
* charachters
, bu here
' s a rundown
. annie
, who wass tje highlight ofthe yhe tghe origonal
, must haev seriously banged her head inthe tyhe turain kresh at teh end ofthe thge firt movei
. why
? baceause something
' s got tothe account forthe her loseing thta many iq points
. even
though annie wasn
' t exactlly a rocket scientist inaddition speed
, here smoe ofthe her actions jsut amking ytou watn tothe beated your head aganist a wall
. forthe instatance
, affter successully useing a chainsaw tothe cutted a hole inwhich a doorjam so thta a gropu ofthe peopel cin excape noxious gases
- she st
ands infront tjhe middle ofthe yhe oppening fo baout five mintues till somone reminds her taht yhe peopel cin
' t git ut till she git
' s hte chainsaw outloud ofthe theri faces
.
.
.
. bing bing bing inspite point ofthe fatc s
andra
' s chracter isnt turned inot littel omre thna oney ofthe thsoe scantly dressed extras fomr hercules
, who constanly hasnt tothe be rescued
. jason patric
? all i cin sday isnt bring bcak keanu
. keanu reeves might hve tghe emotional range ofthe a tree stump
.
.
. bu thgat
' s noe mroe tree stump tahn jason hasnt
. i don
' t tihkn he changed facial expressions all movei
- jason

! nowe frown
!
.
.
. i said frown
.
.
.
. oh
.
.
. ytou are
.
.
. bing beng bing
.
. wooden jstu doesn
' t decribe htis guys performence
, bu it
' ll hvae tothe dont
. tghe bad guy
.
.
.
.
. ahh
.
.
. william dafoe
- htere
' s a bright move
. how cxan ytou go wrong whith yhe star ffrom taht acknowldeged clasic
, body ofthe evidence
?
( yes
, thast isnt sarcasm
)
. his wide eyed maniac ofthe a carachter doesn
' t strat outloud too bad
.
.
.
. bu goes steadily downhill as tjhe movei progresses
. infact thte end he degenerates tothe chasing annie aroud forthe a hostage
, even
though he alraedy hasnt tjhe omney annd cxan excape
.
.
.
. beng bing
.
though i
' d liuke tothe give htis movei a duble thumbs down
, htere weere soem nice sequences
. concidering hte movei cost over 100 milion dollars
- yuo
' d hope htere
' d be at least a cuple
. tghe rela eye
- popper forthe me
, even
though it ws given awya infact thge trailer
.
.
.
. bing bing
.
.
.
.
. ws tje sequence where hte cruise liner sideswipes thte oel tanker
. htis looks terific adn i ws veyr suprised tothe hear taht tje cruise liner infront it ws
.
.
.
. completly cmoputer generated
! wow
.
.
.
. i don
' t tihkn i
' ve ever seen a cg modle look so rela befoer
. thge sequence where jason patric infact trying tothe disable tjhe propellers fomr under yhe ship isnt aslo terific
, adn thge onyl tyme druing tghe entire movei where yuo git thyat feeling ofthe
.
.
.
. speed
. thsi lack
- ofthe
- speed probelm affects many sequences
. such as tje oel tanker part
.
.
.
.
. it wass
-
" oh noone
, we
' re goign tothe hitted thge oel tanker
!
"
, 20 mintues later
-
" oh noone
, we
' re gonig tothe hitted tghe oel tanker
!
" 20 min
.
.
.
. yuo git teh point
. tihs movei failed simpley beccause it didn
' t live uv tothe it
' s nmae
.
.
.
. htere ws veyr littel feeling ofthe speed
. inaddition thte origonal movei
, tghe lead cahracters hadnt tothe mkea splitted second descisions tothe survive
.
.
.
.
. inaddition tihs movei it feeled moreso liek
-
" well peple
, we
' re gonna run inot tht ther isl
and infront a faw hurs
- i htink i might stroll over tothe engineeering annd see if i cxan
' t turn off tyhe engines
.
.
. i
' m passing teh cafeteria onthe hte way
, cant i git anybody anytying
?
" thge endig ofthe thsi movei realyl isnt terrable
. even
though it features whta i
' ve sicne foudn outloud isnt oen ofthe tghe most expensive sequences ever inaddition a movei
- it jstu doesn
' t wokr at all
. thge part where tghe liner crashes thru tjhe twon looks vyre realsitic
, bu
.
.
.
. suprise surprize
- it jsut tkaes waaaaay too long
. it seemed tothe go fo 15 mintues befoer tjhe ship finaly stoped
. oney thign tht striked me as extemely poore scriptiing wass tath as yhe ship crashes thru teh harbour adn twon
, arround 25 peple are killed by tyhe ship
.
.
.
. adn ther
' s onyl 15 or so peopel left onthe tje ship
. so whn it stops safe adn soudn anbd hte charactors are all cheering
- tghe audiance isnt sitting bcak anbd thingking
-
" wait a sec
.
.
. tihs isnt a hapyp moent baceause
?
" bing beng thn htere wass teh dog
.
.
.
.
. i allmost fell outloud ofthe my seat wehn i saw tjhe bited witht hte dog dodging tghe falling debris
. puting a dog inspite peril hasnt become thte ulitmate hollywood cliche
.
.
.
.
.
. eveyr movei seems tothe ahve a
' dog
- inspite
- danger
' sequence
- volcanoe
, dante
' s peak
, independance day
, daylight
, twister
. lost world
.
.
.
.
.
. etc
, etc
. tihs movei isnt a perfect exemple ofthe how nto tothe mkea a sequal
. directer jan de bont shoud try watching hte orignal movei anbd tihs oney bcak
- tothe
- bcak annd see if he realises where he whent wrong
.
