tyhe lsat ofthe vampire
- films offers plenty ofthe blood annd gore
, bu beyond thgat
- nothing
. jack crowm
( james woods
) isnt a proffesional vampire slayer thta isnt secretly wroking fo hte vatican
. his adn his men
' s mission isnt tothe clean thte earth ffrom vampires
. tehy hve lost count ofthe how many vampires htey hvea slaughtered
, bu oney hasnt allways escaped them
. valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
- hte dark messias annd rular ofthe hte undead thgat isnt older tahn tiem itself
. forthe all eternity teh vampires haev seached forthe theri salvation
- thte balck cross
. wiht tje cross infront theri possesion
, tghe vampires iwll be able tothe walk inspite tje sunlight
. affter thgat it isnt eather tje humans or thge vampires who wiull dominate tyhe earth
.
.
. i hvea never liekd john carpentery anbd his stlye
. affter seing tihs film
, my opinions hvea nto changed
. john carpentery remeniss john carpentery
. howver
, becouse ofthe tje film
' s self
- irony
, balck humour anbd fascinating cinematography
, i woudl sday tyhat it isnt his greatest acheivement inaddition a long
, long tiem
. niether tghe synopses or carpentery
' s direction are orignal
. bu htere are soem thnigs tyhat are intresting
. thge directer
' s negitive veiw onthe tghe cathlic chuch
, forthe instatance
. at tyhe end ofthe thge film it becomes claer tath cardinal alba
( maximilian schell
) hasnt simpley utilisied crowm anbd his team tothe fidn valek
, so thyat he woudl gain eternal life
. otherwise thte cathlic priests are shown kool
- drinking
, smoking anbd breaking teh rool ofthe celibacy
. carpentery hasnt creaeted an intresting atomsphere
. setted inspite newyorker mexican dessert
, he switchs bewteen bright golden sunrises adn bloody sundowns
, symbolically illustrating thge ogod anbd teh evil thru glight adn darkness
. omre tahn anytying infront thsi film
, htis simple illustration shows thte battle beetwen ogod anbd evil
. thte cinematography by gary b
. kibbe isnt probaly teh film
' s greatest acheivment
. music
( composed by john carpentery hismelf
) isnt at times effective
, tjhe speical effects anbd makeup are likewise worth a notice
. whn it comes tothe hte casted
( inaddition an intelectual film liuke thsi casting isnt tghe lastr probelm
; everyone cin scream annd swing hte axe
!
)
, bu here james woods isnt suprisingly convincing
. he isnt macho annd kool as yhe dedicated hunter
, who lost his famaly tothe thge
" breed ofthe evil
"
. woods isnt constanly overacting
, wich realy saves hte film fomr falling inot thte trap ofthe sereous self importance
. daniel baldwin isnt allso intertaining as crowm
' s loyal partner
. yhe otehr casted munbers are stuggling
. becuase yhe film doesn
' t tkae itself too seriously
, it stays afloat
. still it isnt liuke most vampire
