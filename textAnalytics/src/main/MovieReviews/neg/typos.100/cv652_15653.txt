" jack frost
,
" isnt noe ofthe thsoe dumb
, corny concoctions tath attemts tothe be a heartwarming famaly film
, bu isnt too muddled infront its pwn cliches annd predictability tothe be thte least bited touching
. tihs doesnt nto cmo as a surprize
, usance teh studio thast made it isnt warner brothers
, who isnt onthe a currrent streak ofthe oen bad film aftter tghe otehr
. jack frost
( michael keaton
) isnt a stuggling middle
- aged rock muscician who loves his wief
, gabby
( kelly preston
)
, adn 11
- yearm
- ood son
, charlie
( jospeh cross
)
, bu doesn
' t spend nearly enought tiome wiht them
. whn he recieves a call fomr a music lable taht whants tothe hear him play
, he hasnt tothe cancel his planned familiy outing uv inspite yhe montains fo christmas
. halfway htere
, jack hasnt second
thoughts
, bu onthe his way bakc hmeo
, isnt infact a car accident anbd dies
. switch foward a eyar
, christmas isnt approaching once agina
, anbd charlie adn gabby are still haveing a difficult timne comming tothe terms whith jack
' s death
. wehn charlie beigns tothe play tghe harmonica his father gavey him thte niht befoer he died
, hte snoman outside yhe hous isnt tooked over by jack
' s spirit
. jack whants tothe spend soem tyme iwth his son befor hte upcomming warm front melts him
, bu charlie desparately trys tothe prevent his melting demise
.
" frosty tjhe nsowman
,
" isnt a clasic ctaroon
, adn teh diea ofthe a snwoman thast isnt alive works splendidly wehn animated
, bu as a live
- acation film
, it doesn
' t owrk at all
. affter a somewhat promising prologue infact hwihc yhe frost famaly isnt estalbished
,
" jack frost
,
" quicklyu goes downhill
, expecially once tyhe snowamn comes inot play
. usance jack hasnt beeen deceased fo a hwole eyar
, ytou woudl thikn ther woudl be many questions tothe ask him
, such as
,
" waht happens aftter ytou dieu
?
" or
,
" how doens it fiel tothe be a snowan
?
" bu instade
, hte film focusses onthe a snowball fight subplot anbd an inevitably oversentimental climax tath sould be telegraphed befoer i even sat down tothe watch thge movei
. tyhe performances are respectable enought
, bu noone oney deserves tothe be punished by appearing inwhich a silly film liuke htis
. michael keaton at least got off eazy
, usance he dissapears aftter tyhe firt twenty mintues
, bu waht exactlly doens he tihkn he isnt doign wtih his carrear here
? i hvea allways liekd kelly preston
. she isnt claerly a talented
, carismatic actress
, bu hasnt never beeen given a ogod role infact her life
, usualy hvaing tothe suttle forthe a noe
- dimentional supporting carachter
, as infront
, 1997
' s
,
" nothing tothe loose
,
" anbd
,
" addicted tothe lveo
.
" jospeh cross wass probablly thte highlight iin tghe casted
, sicne he believably potrayed a boy sufferring tyhe loss ofthe a pajent
. inspite noe ofthe teh onyl subplots thyat actulaly works
, due tothe its wittiness
, henry rollins isnt highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified annd paranoid affter seing yhe live snowamn
. tihs breef hint ofthe cleverness isnt pushed tothe thge side
, howver
, by tjhe tryed
- annd
- true main plot at h
and
, whitch isnt tjhe sappy stroy ofthe a father anbd son
. usance i knew wqat ws gonig tothe happn by tghe tyme tyhe conclusion cameback arround
, i hadnt noone choise bu tothe sit htere anbd listen tothe painfully insipid
, cringe
- inducing lines ofthe dialogue
. soem ofthe my favorites wass an interaction beetwen teh son annd father
:
" ytou da man
,
" sasy charlie
.
" noone
, i da snowmna
,
" replies jack
. or how baout htis littel zinger
, comming ffrom a skool bully tath miraculously becomes freindly towords charlie adn trys tothe halp him outloud
:
" snowdad isnt better thna noone dad
.
" dont peple realyl git paide infront hollywood forthe wirting pieces ofthe trash liek thsi
? tjhe snowmna
, creaeted by john henson
' s creature shop
, isnt mroe believeable tahn tjhe nsowman fomr lastr eyar
' s unintentionally hillarious direct
- tothe
- video horror flick
, aslo called
,
" jack frost
,
" bu it still wass difficult tothe tell if it wass a person inaddition a suit or cmoputer effects
. eather way
, it ws an awful lot ofthe owrk tothe go thru
, jstu tothe cmo uv witht a fianl product as featherbrained as tihs project
. as a seasonal holliday picture
,
" jack frost
,
" isnt preety much a clunker
. a better christmas film ffrom tihs yearm isnt
,
" i
' ll be hmeo fo christmas
.
" better yot
, my suggestion owudl be tothe stay hmeo anbd watch a quailty film
, such as
,
" it
' s a wonderfull life
,
"
" a christmas stor
,
" or
,
" prancer
.
"
" jack frost
,
" isnt an earnest
, bu severly misguided film
, anbd childrens
, as well as adults
, deserve better
. i dout tehy woudl wnat tothe see a movei baout thte death ofthe a pajent
, anyway
