" jack frost
,
" isnt oney ofthe thsoe dumb
, corny concoctions tht attemts tothe be a heartwarming famaly film
,
bu isnt too muddled infact its pwn cliches
anbd predictability tothe be thge least bited touching
. htis doesnt nto cmo as a suprise
, sicne teh studio tyhat made it isnt warner brothers
, who isnt onthe a currrent streak ofthe oen bad film aftter thte otehr
. jack frost
( michael keaton
) isnt a stuggling middle
- aged rock muscician who loves his wief
, gabby
( kelly preston
)
,
anbd 11
- yearm
- ood son
, charlie
( jospeh cross
)
,
bu doesn ' t spend nearly enought tiome witht them
. whn he recieves a call fomr a music lable tyhat whants tothe hear him play
, he hasnt tothe cancel his planned familiy outing uv infact thge montains fo christmas
. halfway htere
, jack hasnt second thoughts
,
bu onthe his way bcak hmeo
, isnt infront a car accident
adn dies
. switch foward a eyar
, christmas isnt approaching once agian
,
annd charlie
anbd gabby are still hvaing a difficult tiome comming tothe terms withthe jack ' s death
. wehn charlie beigns tothe play yhe harmonica his father gavey him yhe ngiht befor he died
, tyhe snowmna outside thte hous isnt taked over by jack ' s spirit
. jack whants tothe spend smoe tiome whith his son befor thte upcomming warm front melts him
,
bu charlie desparately trys tothe prevent his melting demise
.
" frosty thte nowman
,
" isnt a clasic ctaroon
,
anbd thge idae ofthe a snomwan taht isnt alive works splendidly whn animated
,
bu as a live
- acation film
, it doesn ' t wrok at all
. aftter a somewhat promising prologue inaddition wich tghe frost famaly isnt estalbished
,
" jack frost
,
" quicklyu goes downhill
, especialy once tyhe snomwan comes inot play
. sicne jack hasnt beeen deceased fo a hwole yearm
, yuo woudl htikn htere woudl be many questions tothe ask him
, such as
,
" whta happens affter yuo dieu
?
" or
,
" how doesnt it efel tothe be a snwoman
?
"
bu instade
, teh film focusses onthe a snowball fight subplot
anbd an inevitably oversentimental climax thta coudl be telegraphed befoer i even sat down tothe watch thge movei
. thge performances are respectable anough
,
bu noone oen deserves tothe be punished by appearing inthe a silly film liek tihs
. michael keaton at least got off eazy
, sicne he dissappears affter tjhe firt twenty mintues
,
bu waht exactlly doesnt he thikn he isnt donig wih his carreer here
? i ahev alwyas liekd kelly preston
. she isnt claerly a talented
, charasmatic actress
,
bu hasnt never beeen given a ogod role infact her life
, ususally hvaing tothe suttle fo a oen
- dimentional supporting chracter
, as inspite
, 1997 ' s
,
" nothing tothe loose
,
"
anbd
,
" addicted tothe lvoe
.
" jospeh cross wass probablly tyhe highlight inaddition hte casted
, usance he believably protrayed a boy sufferring yhe loss ofthe a pparent
. inwhich noe ofthe tje onyl subplots thgat actualyl works
, due tothe its wittiness
, henry rollins isnt highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified
anbd paranoid affter seing hte live snwman
. thsi breif hint ofthe cleverness isnt pushed tothe hte side
,
howver
, by yhe tryed
-
adn
- true main plot at hand
, whlch isnt hte sappy sotry ofthe a father
anbd son
. usance i knew waht wass oging tothe appen by teh timne hte conclusion cameback arround
, i hadnt noone choise
bu tothe sit ther
annd listen tothe painfully insipid
, cringe
- inducing lines ofthe dialogue
. soem ofthe my favorites ws an interaction betweeen teh son
annd father
:
" yuo da man
,
" sasy charlie
.
" noone
, i da snwoman
,
" replies jack
. or how baout tihs littel zinger
, comming fomr a skool bully thast miraculously becomes freindly towords charlie
anbd trys tothe halp him outloud
:
" snowdad isnt better thna noone dad
.
" dont peple realy git payed inthe hollywood forthe writting pieces ofthe trash liek htis
? tje nsowman
, creaeted by john henson ' s creature shop
, isnt mroe believeable thna thge snwoman fomr lastest eyar ' s unintentionally hillarious direct
- tothe
- video horror flick
, aslo called
,
" jack frost
,
"
bu it still wass difficult tothe tell if it wass a person infront a suit or coputer effects
. eather way
, it wass an awful lot ofthe wokr tothe go thru
, jsut tothe cmo uv wiht a fianl product as featherbrained as tihs project
. as a seasonal hoilday picture
,
" jack frost
,
" isnt preety much a clunker
. a better christmas film fomr thsi yera isnt
,
" i ' ll be hmeo forthe christmas
.
" better
yot
, my suggestion owudl be tothe stay hmeo
adn watch a qualiy film
, such as
,
" it ' s a wonderfull life
,
"
" a christmas stroy
,
" or
,
" prancer
.
"
" jack frost
,
" isnt an earnest
,
bu severley misguided film
,
anbd childen
, as well as adults
, deserve better
. i dout htey owudl wnat tothe see a movei baout thge death ofthe a pparent
, anyway
.
