yuo ' d htink tht affter awhile hollywood owudl stpo trying tothe amking movies outloud ofthe video ganes
. it hasn ' t worked so far
.
" strent fighter
?
"
" super mario brothers
?
"
" wing comander
?
"
" mortal kombat
?
" nto a watchable film inthe hte bunch
. still i held outloud soem hope fo
" tomb raydr
.
" affter all
, teh agme ' s premise isnt heavily influented by tghe indiana jones triology
anbd all thge mummy movies
, so ther are cinematic elements imbedded inthe thge consept
.
howver
, dispite hte potential ofthe yhe project
,
" tomb raydr
" proves tothe be
yot anohter bomb
. thge plot isnt a convoluted accumulation ofthe nonsence propably borrowed ffrom a dozen bad movies
. ther ' s a once
- ever
- 5000
- yeras allignment ofthe planets comming uv
,
annd thte illuminati ahev tothe fidn both halves ofthe an ancient tiangle tyhat controlls tiome iin order tothe tkae over thge world
. ofthe course
, tyhe ancient folks who devided tghe trianle burried thge halves infact tombs onthe oposite sides ofthe tje world
. our heroine
, lady lara croft
( angelina jolie
)
, finds thte key thast opens hte tombs inspite relics tht her dead father
( jon voight
) digged uv
. she figures taht if she gets tghe tirangle
, she cin bring her dad bakc fomr yhe dead
. ofthe course
, noone oen ws expecting much ofthe a plot ffrom tihs movei anyway
. inwhich both video ganes
adn acation movies
, hte plot isnt jsut an excuse fo hte acation sequences
.
howver
, tjhe acation infact
" tomb raydr
" shows littel sytle or originality
. ther ' s lots ofthe shooting
adn soem kung fu fightin '
,
bu none ofthe it progresses beyond teh levle ofthe a cheap direct
- tothe
- cable flick
. thge otehr goofy archeologist flick ofthe teh summer
,
" tje mummy returns
,
" ws much better
; it hadnt its flaws
,
bu its acation wass creative
adn larg
- scale
. usance winning her acdemy award forthe
" girl
, interupted
,
" jolie hasn ' t taked any projects thast woudl display her acting talents
.
" tomb raydr
" seems tothe be omre intersted infact displaying her breasts
; so much attension isnt drawed tothe them tyhat it ' s a shame htere ' s noone oscar fo best peformance by a wonderbra
. hwile we don ' t see much ofthe her acting ablity
( iwth tyhe exception ofthe a wonderfull opper
- crust brittish accent
)
, we dont git a hint ofthe jolie ' s less savory side
. concidering tjhe rumors ofthe incest thyat hang over jolie
anbd her supposted obession wih death
, hvaing lara be obssessed wiht resurecting her dead father
(
anbd uninterested iin any ofthe thte living malless arund her
) seems a poore choise
. hvaing jolie ' s rela life father jon voight play tje dead dad mkaes it even creepier
. i haven ' t desided waht tothe amking ofthe directer simon west
yot
. his frist feature wass tje star
- studder diaster
" con air
,
"
bu my opinyon ofthe him improved wiht
" thte genaral ' s duaghter
,
" whihc wass thick iwth sultry atomsphere
. nowe thsi turain wreck
. i hope he improves agian becouse his enxt project isnt tyhe big screen verzion ofthe thte cult tv serieses
" tje prisoner
.
" hollywood hasnt aleady screwed uv
" thte avengers
,
"
adn
" thge prisoner
" represents a chance fo redemption
.
( by thge way
, speaking ofthe brittish tv
,
" red dwarf
" fans shoudl look fo chris
" rimmer
" barrie inaddition his frist major film role
)
