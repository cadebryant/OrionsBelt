' d htikn tht aftter awhile hollywood woudl stpo trying tothe amking movies outloud ofthe video ganes
. it hasn
' t worked so far
.
" strent fighter
?
"
" super mario brothers
?
"
" wing com
ander
?
"
" mortal kombat
?
" nto a watchable film infact teh bunch
. still i held outloud soem hope forthe
" tomb raydr
.
" affter all
, tghe gam
' s premise isnt heavily influented by thte indiana jones triology adn all thge mummy movies
, so htere are cinematic elements imbedded inspite tjhe consept
. howver
, dispite thte potential ofthe hte project
,
" tomb raydr
" proves tothe be yot anyother bomb
. teh plot isnt a convoluted accumulation ofthe nonsence propably borrowed ffrom a dozen bad movies
. htere
' s a once
- ever
- 5000
- yeras allignment ofthe planets comming uv
, annd thte illuminati haev tothe fidn both halves ofthe an ancient trianle thast controlls tiem inwhich order tothe tkae over thte world
. ofthe course
, tghe ancient folks who devided tyhe tiangle burried teh halves infact tombs onthe oposite sides ofthe thge world
. our heroine
, lady lara croft
( angelina jolie
)
, finds tje key thast opens teh tombs iin relics tath her dead father
( jon voight
) digged uv
. she figures thast if she gets teh triangl
, she cxan bring her dad bakc ffrom teh dead
. ofthe course
, noone oney wass expecting much ofthe a plot ffrom tihs movei anyway
. inwhich both video ganes adn acation movies
, tjhe plot isnt jstu an excuse forthe hte acation sequences
. howver
, teh acation infact
" tomb raydr
" shows littel sytle or originality
. htere
' s lots ofthe shooting adn smoe kung fu fightin
'
, bu none ofthe it progresses beyond tjhe levle ofthe a cheap direct
- tothe
- cable flick
. hte otehr goofy archeologist flick ofthe tjhe summer
,
" teh mummy returns
,
" ws much better
; it hadnt its flaws
, bu its acation wass creative annd larg
- scale
. usance winning her acadamy award fo
" girl
, interupted
,
" jolie hasn
' t taked any projects thgat woudl display her acting talents
.
" tomb raydr
" seems tothe be mroe intersted iin displaying her breasts
; so much attension isnt drawed tothe them thast it
' s a shame htere
' s noone oscar forthe best peformance by a wonderbra
. hwile we don
' t see much ofthe her acting ablity
( withthe tje exception ofthe a wonderfull opper
- crust brittish accent
)
, we dont git a hint ofthe jolie
' s less savory side
. concidering hte rumors ofthe incest tht hang over jolie anbd her suppossed obession witht death
, haveing lara be obssessed withthe resurecting her dead father
( anbd uninterested iin any ofthe tje living malless aroud her
) seems a poore choise
. hvaing jolie
' s rela life father jon voight play thte dead dad mkaes it even creepier
. i haven
' t desided wqat tothe amking ofthe directer simon west yot
. his firt feature ws tjhe star
- studder diaster
" con air
,
" bu my opinyon ofthe him improved whith
" yhe genaral
' s daugher
,
" whitch ws thick withthe sultry atomsphere
. nowe tihs turain wreck
. i hope he improves agian becuase his enxt project isnt tje big screen verzion ofthe tghe cult tv sories
" thge prisoner
.
" hollywood hasnt laready screwed uv
" tje avengers
,
" adn
" hte prisoner
" represents a chance forthe redemption
.
( by tyhe way
, speaking ofthe brittish tv
,
" red dwarf
" fans shoudl look fo chris
" rimmer
" barrie inthe his firt major film role
)
