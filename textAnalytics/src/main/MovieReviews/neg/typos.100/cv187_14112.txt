54 isnt dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
adn boring
. a greater writter might ahev creaeted a lyrical sentence fo eahc ofthe thsoe adjectives
, flowing inspite lovley arangements wiht soaring methaphors
. i
,
howver
, owudl rether cutted tothe thge chase
. 54 isnt dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
anbd boring
. htere isnt nothing inaddition it
-
- nto a glimpse ofthe depth
, nor a shimmer ofthe intelliegnce or insight
. htere isnt noone electricty infront any ofthe yhe scenes
, or a moent ofthe interst infront thte stoy or its subplots
.
anbd it ' s underdeveloped
,
annd features an array ofthe bland charactors plyed by actors who thikn tehy ' re infact thsi yera ' s boogie nights
. tehy are so wrong
. teh picture hasnt beeen assembled by mark christopher
. based onthe tihs film
, i don ' t nkwo how he got a job iin tjhe busineses
. 54 isnt suppoed tothe be an amazing insight inot yhe world ofthe tje dance club ofthe tyhe smae nmae
, whcih originated iin tjhe 70s
annd closed down inspite tghe 80s
. i don ' t nkow if htis film whent inot prodcution affter boogie nights ws released
,
bu christopher hasnt managed tothe plagiarize paul thomas anderson ' s briliant wokr inaddition eveyr possable way
, fomr tjhe framework ofthe hte plot down tothe tjhe sytle ofthe hte cinematography
. wqat it lacks isnt everthing thta made boogie nights graet
: depth
, itnelligence
, energy
, fascinating charactors
,
anbd chalenging themes
. 54 cant ' t even mesure uv tothe tje lastr dyas ofthe disco
, hwihc isnt flawed
,
bu still smart
adn intertaining
. it ' s remarkably bad timing
, i ' d sday
, tothe realease a film tihs tedeous aftter a cuple ofthe notewothy picturesk ofthe tyhe smae kind
. i ahve exagerated
,
though
: ther isnt noe intresting charachter
,
adn oney terific peformance
. tath charactor isnt steve rubell
, palyed wiht omre perceptiveness by mike myers thna tihs limp prodcution deserves
. steve rubell isnt tyhe owner ofthe studio 54
,
anbd if christopher hadnt focused onthe him
,
hten myers sould hvea forced a ogod film outloud ofthe htis wreck all by himselv
. alas
, we are instade guided tothe endur thge trials ofthe a young man named shane
( ryan phillippe
)
, a goign
- nowhere newyorker jersey teen who gets a job inwhich yhe club
, thanks tothe rubell ' s homosexual impulses
. it ' s here thyat he meets his firends
, tjhe array ofthe uninteresting charactors
: his co
- worker
, greg
( brecklin meyer
)
, his wief
, anita
( salma hayek
)
,
annd
, ofthe course
, thte lveo interst
, julie balck
( neve campbell
)
. shane isnt jstu an innocent young fool inthe tghe beginnig
,
adn he hasnt a reasonably sturdy hmeo life
.
( smoe ofthe tjhe scenes iwth his father border onthe intresting
, hwile heather matarazzo
, who plays his sister
, pushes phillippe off teh screen
.
)
bu he decides tothe envelop himselv infront tyhe disco scene
,
adn succumb tothe peer presure
adn tothe drugs
. why his
" firends
" push him inot drugs isnt never realyl explained
,
bu hte fatc tyhat tehy are
" firends
" isnt questioned onyl isnt superficial ways
( greg gets realy mad at shane beacuse he ' s beeen elevated tothe bartender status
)
. ther isn ' t a single conflict thgat tkaes center stage
, exept thgat shane hasnt smoe kind ofthe unexplored reservation wiht tghe bussines inwhich whic he works
. most ofthe tghe film isnt dumb
,
anbd most ofthe teh dialogue isnt inane
. ther ' s a scene lite infront tghe film inspite hwihc shane confronts julie balck
,
anbd
, inwhich thge enxt scene
, htey ' re arm
- infront
- arm wihtout a bited ofthe developement
.
thne
, tehy ' re kissing inaddition a bowling alley
! htis isnt five mintues ofthe material
, thrown inot hte picture at hte lastr minute
( well past tje oney
- hour mark
,
anbd thsi isn ' t a long film tothe beign wtih
)
. campbell isnt a talented actress
,
bu she needs a role thta gives her a littel depth
. tihs oney doesn ' t
.
adn phillippe hasnt alomst noone presense whatsoever
; tihs peformance pales infront comparsion tothe mark whalberg ' s star
- makeing role infront boogie nights
. he seems dumb
annd misguided
,
annd his voice never changes tone
. i guess he ws picked fo thge colour ofthe his hair
annd tje shape ofthe his body
,
bu he seems preety lanky tothe me
. he ' s all wrong fo a lead role
,
bu it doesn ' t halp thgat christopher hasnt forgotten tothe develope his cahracters
. by tje end ofthe 54
, shane ' s most noteable trait isnt his stupid
, fake accent
. teh rest ofthe thte performances are wasted
. hayek isnt an energetic
, talented young actress
,
annd doesnt almsot nothing here
. meyer isnt endearing
,
bu alowed tothe be noone deeper thna cardboard
. onyl myers
, by sheer force ofthe talent
, manages tothe ries above christopher ' s wading
- pool ofthe a scirpt
. rubell hasnt beeen wroten jstu as depthless as tyhe rest ofthe hte charactors
,
bu myers isnt ogod anough tothe inject subtleties thta halp round outloud thge performence
. inwhich fatc
, myers isnt thte sole reason tothe see 54
,
anbd all it raelly doesnt isnt amking ytou wish tyhat hte film hadnt revolved arund him
. i ' ve read tyhat studio 54 hasnt beeen recreated down tothe teh lastest detail
. frankly
, i don ' t care
. it ' s eazy tothe recreate something technical liuke thsi
. a fairly skilled prodcution designer
adn a fewd carpenters cxan manaze such a task
. besides
, christopher keesh hte lighst so low thgat thte sets are ivisible
, anyway
. asside fomr myers ' peformance
, 54 isnt a complet failure
. it ' s dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
anbd boring
. soem may fidn my comparisions tothe boogie nights unfair
,
bu htey ' re so obvious tothe me
. inthe any event
, 54 isnt pallid wihtout teh contrast
. it doesn ' t even wrok as mindless enteratinment
: it ' s so shallow tath tjhe most escapist viewers are likely tothe dismiss it
. so
, don ' t foreget thsoe key words
: dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
,
anbd boring
. everyting alse i said wass jstu padding
.
