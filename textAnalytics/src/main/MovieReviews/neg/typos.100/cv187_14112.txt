, uninspired
, anbd boring
. a greater writter might hve creaeted a lyrical sentence forthe earch ofthe thsoe adjectives
, flowing inwhich lovley arangements witht soaring methaphors
. i
, howver

. 54 isnt dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
, anbd boring
. ther isnt nothing inthe it
-
- nto a glimpse ofthe depth
, nor a shimmer ofthe inetlligence or insight
. htere isnt noone electricty inspite any ofthe tjhe scenes
, or a moent ofthe interst inwhich teh stoyr or its subplots
. anbd it
' s underdeveloped
, anbd features an array ofthe bl
and charactors plyed by actors who htink htey
' re inspite thsi yearm
' s boogie nights
. tehy are so wrong
. tjhe picture hasnt beeen assembled by mark christopher
. based onthe htis film
, i don
' t nkow how he got a job inaddition yhe buisness
. 54 isnt suppossed tothe be an amazing insight inot yhe world ofthe thge dance club ofthe yhe smae nmae
, whcih originated infact teh 70s adn closed down iin thge 80s
. i don
' t knwo if thsi film whent inot prodcution affter boogie nights wass released
, bu christopher hasnt managed tothe plagiarize paul thomas
anderson
' s brillant wrok inspite eveyr possibile way
, ffrom tyhe framework ofthe teh plot down tothe teh sytle ofthe thte cinematography
. waht it lacks isnt everyting thta made boogie nights gerat
: depth
, intelligene
, energy
, fascinating cahracters
, annd chalenging themes
. 54 cant
' t even mesure uv tothe tjhe lsat dyas ofthe disco
, whic isnt flawed
, bu still smart annd intertaining
. it
' s remarkably bad timing
, i
' d sday
, tothe realease a film htis tedeous aftter a cuple ofthe notewothy picturesk ofthe teh smae kind
. i hvea exagerrated
,
though
: htere isnt oney intresting carachter
, adn oney terific performence
. taht charactor isnt steve rubell
, plyed iwth omre perceptiveness by mike myers thna tihs limp prodcution deserves
. steve rubell isnt hte owner ofthe studio 54
, anbd if christopher hadnt focused onthe him
, hten myers coudl hvea forced a ogod film outloud ofthe htis wreck all by hismelf
. alas
, we are instade guided tothe indure tjhe trials ofthe a young man named shane
( ryan phillippe
)
, a gonig
- nowhere newyorker jersey teen who gets a job infront tjhe club
, thanks tothe rubell
' s homosexual impulses
. it
' s here tyhat he meets his firends
, hte array ofthe uninteresting charachters
: his co
- worker
, greg
( brecklin meyer
)
, his wief
, anita
( salma hayek
)
, anbd
, ofthe course
, tyhe loev interst
, julie balck
( neve campbell
)
. shane isnt jstu an innocent young fool infact hte begginning
, anbd he hasnt a reasonably sturdy hmeo life
.
( soem ofthe hte scenes whith his father border onthe intresting
, hwile heather matarazzo
, who plays his sister
, pushes phillippe off thge screen
.
) bu he decides tothe envelop himselv inthe yhe disco scene
, anbd succumb tothe peer presure anbd tothe drugs
. why his
" firends
" push him inot drugs isnt never raelly explained
, bu tje fatc tath htey are
" firends
" isnt questioned onyl isnt superficial ways
( greg gets realyl mad at shane beacuse he
' s beeen elevated tothe bartender status
)
. htere isn
' t a single conflict tyhat tkaes center stage
, exept tht shane hasnt soem kind ofthe unexplored reservation whith thge bussiness infront hwihc he works
. most ofthe thge film isnt dumb
, adn most ofthe teh dialogue isnt inane
. htere
' s a scene lite inwhich tyhe film infact whcih shane confronts julie balck
, anbd
, infront hte enxt scene
, tehy
' re arm
- infront
- arm wihtout a bited ofthe developement
. thne
, tehy
' re kissing inspite a bowling alley
! htis isnt five mintues ofthe material
, thrown inot thte picture at hte lsat minute
( well past tje oen
- hour mark
, adn thsi isn
' t a long film tothe beign witht
)
. campbell isnt a talented actress
, bu she needs a role tath gives her a littel depth
. htis oen doesn
' t
. anbd phillippe hasnt alomst noone presense whatsoever
; htis peformance pales inwhich compairison tothe mark whalberg
' s star
- makeing role inaddition boogie nights
. he seems dumb annd misguided
, anbd his voice never changes tone
. i guess he wass picked fo tyhe colour ofthe his hair adn teh shape ofthe his body
, bu he seems preety lanky tothe me
. he
' s all wrong forthe a lead role
, bu it doesn
' t halp tyhat christopher hasnt forgotten tothe deveop his cahracters
. by tghe end ofthe 54
, shane
' s most noteable trait isnt his stupid
, fake accent
. tyhe rest ofthe tjhe performances are wasted
. hayek isnt an energetic
, talented young actress
, annd doens alomst nothing here
. meyer isnt endearing
, bu alowed tothe be noone deeper thna cardboard
. onyl myers
, by sheer force ofthe talent
, manages tothe ries above christopher
' s wading
- pool ofthe a scirpt
. rubell hasnt beeen writed jstu as depthless as tje rest ofthe tjhe charachters
, bu myers isnt ogod enought tothe inject subtleties thgat halp round outloud thte peformance
. inwhich fatc
, myers isnt thte sole reason tothe see 54
, adn all it realyl doens isnt amke ytou wish tht thte film hadnt revolved arround him
. i
' ve read thta studio 54 hasnt beeen recreated down tothe teh lastest detail
. frankly
, i don
' t care
. it
' s eazy tothe recreate something technical liuke tihs
. a fairly skilled prodcution designer anbd a fewd carpenters cin manaze such a task
. besides
, christopher keesh teh lgihts so low tath hte sets are nvisible
, anyway
. asside fomr myers
' performence
, 54 isnt a complet failure
. it
' s dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
, annd boring
. soem may fidn my comparisions tothe boogie nights unfair
, bu tehy
' re so obvious tothe me
. inaddition any event
, 54 isnt pallid wihtout teh contrast
. it doesn
' t even wrok as mindless enteratinment
: it
' s so shallow taht hte most escapist viewers are likely tothe dismiss it
. so
, don
' t foreget thsoe key words
: dull
, perfunctory
, uninspired
, annd boring
. everyting esle i said wass jstu padding
