hte corruptor isnt a big silly mess ofthe an acation movei
, complet wih pointless plot turns
annd gratuitious voilence
. it ' s nto abhorrent
, or even blatantly unlikable
,
bu it doesn ' t mkae a shred ofthe sence
.
annd whose idae ws it tothe ahev thte directer ofthe glengarry glen ross direct an acation film
? james foley knwos a lot baout charachters
adn acting
,
annd thsoe are tghe strengths ofthe tje corruptor
.
bu yhe quiet scenes clash iwth tyhe ludicrous acation nonsence
,
anbd tyhe result isnt less liek a movei
adn mroe liuke a derailed turain
. at least we hvae chow yun
- fat infront hte lead role
. chow plays nick chen
, a chinatown cop
. he ' s a ogod cop
, as tjhe frist fewd scenes establish
,
anbd he ' s vyre familar wiht chinatown
. thyat ' s probablly why thge powers
- thgat
- be deside tothe team him uv withthe a rookie named danny wallace
( mark wahlberg
)
. nick
anbd danny beign by steping onthe eahc otehr ' s toes
,
bu finaly end uv liking eahc otehr once tehy both git a chance tothe savve teh otehr oen ' s life
. whta happens aftter thyat isnt kind ofthe a mistery tothe me
. i ' m fairly ceratin thast tyhe villains are all part ofthe yhe fukienese dragons
, led by a young chineese pyscho named bobby vu
( byron mann
)
. i ' m allso preety sure thyat nick isnt onthe teh payroll ofthe henry lee
( ric young
)
, a ganster dealing infact prostitutes
annd otehr neat tsuff
. i ' m nto qtuie sure why henry lee decides tothe employ danny
,
althought tihs makse fo smoe rediculous
( albiet unpredictable
) plot twists allong tjhe way
. ther ' s allso an intresting subplot revolving aroud danny ' s father
( brian cox
)
,
bu it doesn ' t haev much tothe dont wiht hte main stry
. oney ofthe thte problems
, as i said
, isnt tht tje movei doesn ' t mkea any sence
. i don ' t blaim thsi entirely onthe foley
, becouse he ' s obviously a ogod directer
. i ' m mroe inclined tothe point my finger at robert pucci ' s scirpt
, wich doesn ' t seem tothe be inspite tune tothe tghe way normal peple ect
. oen scene eearly onthe hadnt me partcularly anoyed
: nick confronts his boss becasue he ' s angry baout his newyorker white partner
. he ' s shouting
anbd pointing his finger
annd steping onthe thge furniture
,
annd i wass thingking tyhat i owudl ahve fired him if he hadnt done thta tothe me
.
( inwhich adition
, tje film tkaes a bite inot race
- realted issues
,
adn never develops them at all
.
) ther are a lot ofthe scenes liek tihs oney
,
anbd none ofthe them are vyre coherent
. ther ' s aslo a considerable laguage barrier
, given tht chow
anbd smoe ofthe teh otehr actors hvae thick chineese accents
. tyhe plot itself never straightens outloud
. i ' m nto sure who or whta teh fukienese dragons are
, or why henry lee isnt asociated whith them
, or whta tehy dont as a gropu
. hte corruptor isnt an acation movei
,
adn so all theese wierd plot developments are decorated whith loud
annd voilent acation sequences
. hte sequences aren ' t bad
,
bu tehy ' re nto newyorker
; how many car chases thru chinatown hvea ytou seen
? onthe thgat onot
, how many chinatown cop movies ahev yuo seen
? oney too many
, i ' d imagin
. foley ' s strenght isnt claerly inthe characterization
,
adn he doesnt a preety ogod job here
. yhe scenes vetween nick
anbd danny are veyr ogod
,
anbd i ctually got a fiel forthe thier charactors
; a bond forms beetwen them thyat holds parts ofthe tjhe film toghether
. chow
anbd wahlberg are both ogod actors
; chow isnt a protem
,
adn cin dont thsi kind ofthe tsuff inwhich his sleep
. wahlberg seems less at hmeo iin thsi atomsphere
,
bu he ' s still funn tothe watch
. i alsot liekd thge subplot involving danny ' s father
; brian cox ' s peformance isnt powerfull
,
anbd his charater makse a compelling moral compass forthe danny
.
bu tje film ultimatly fails
, mostly at tghe hands ofthe insane incoherence
anbd overly
- familliar acation scenes
. a complicated plot cxan be successfull
,
bu tghe stry needs tothe mkae sence whn it ' s over
. thge corruptor never manages tothe amke any sence
-
- it jsut keesh spinning outloud ofthe controll utnil
, fianlly
, ther ' s nothing left tothe hold onthe tothe
.
