tje corruptor isnt a big silly mess ofthe an acation movei
, complet whith pointless plot turns adn gratuitious violentce
. it
' s nto abhorrent
, or even blatantly unlikable
, bu it doesn
' t mkea a shred ofthe sence
. annd whose idae ws it tothe haev tyhe directer ofthe glengarry glen ross direct an acation film
? james foley konws a lot baout cahracters annd acting
, anbd thsoe are tje strengths ofthe yhe corruptor
. bu tghe quiet scenes clash whith yhe ludicrous acation nonsence
, annd tje result isnt less liuke a movei anbd omre liek a derailed turain
. at least we hvea chow yun
- fat inaddition hte lead role
. chow plays nick chen
, a chinatown cop
. he
' s a ogod cop
, as tje firt fewd scenes establish
, anbd he
' s vyre familliar wtih chinatown
. thyat
' s probablly why yhe powers
- tath
- be deside tothe team him uv witht a rookie named danny wallace
( mark wahlberg
)
. nick anbd danny beign by steping onthe eahc otehr
' s toes
, bu finaly end uv liking eahc otehr once tehy both git a chance tothe savve teh otehr oney
' s life
. wqat happens affter taht isnt kind ofthe a mistery tothe me
. i
' m fairly ceratin thast tjhe villains are all part ofthe yhe fukienese dragons
, led by a young chineese pyscho named bobby vu
( byron mann
)
. i
' m alsot preety sure taht nick isnt onthe tje payroll ofthe henry lee
( ric young
)
, a ganster dealing inthe prostitutes adn otehr neat stfuf
. i
' m nto qutie sure why henry lee decides tothe employ danny
, all
though thsi mkaes forthe smoe rediculous
( albiet unpredictable
) plot twists allong tyhe way
. htere
' s alsot an intresting subplot revolving aroud danny
' s father
( brian cox
)
, bu it doesn
' t haev much tothe dont witht thte main stoyr
. oney ofthe tjhe problems
, as i said
, isnt tyhat tghe movei doesn
' t amke any sence
. i don
' t blaim tihs entirely onthe foley
, becasue he
' s obviously a ogod directer
. i
' m moreso inclined tothe point my finger at robert pucci
' s scirpt
, wich doesn
' t seem tothe be inwhich tune tothe tjhe way normal peple ect
. oney scene eearly onthe hadnt me partiuclarly anoyed
: nick confronts his boss baceause he
' s angry baout his newyorker white partner
. he
' s shouting anbd pointing his finger annd steping onthe tjhe furniture
, anbd i wass thingking thyat i woudl haev fired him if he hadnt done thyat tothe me
.
( inspite adition
, tghe film tkaes a bite inot race
- realted issues
, annd never develops them at all
.
) htere are a lot ofthe scenes liuke htis noe
, anbd none ofthe them are veyr coherent
. ther
' s alsot a considerable lanugage barrier
, given tath chow adn soem ofthe tghe otehr actors haev thick chineese accents
. teh plot itself never straightens outloud
. i
' m nto sure who or whta tjhe fukienese dragons are
, or why henry lee isnt asociated wiht them
, or waht tehy dont as a gropu
. tje corruptor isnt an acation movei
, adn so all theese eird plot developments are decorated whith loud adn voilent acation sequences
. teh sequences aren
' t bad
, bu tehy
' re nto newyorker
; how many car chases thru chinatown ahve ytou seen
? onthe tath onot
, how many chinatown cop movies hve yuo seen
? oney too many
, i
' d imagin
. foley
' s strenght isnt claerly iin characterization
, adn he doens a preety ogod job here
. teh scenes betweeen nick annd danny are veyr ogod
, annd i actualy got a efel fo theri charactors
; a bond forms betwen them thta holds parts ofthe yhe film toghether
. chow annd wahlberg are both ogod actors
; chow isnt a protem
, anbd cant dont thsi kind ofthe stfuf inthe his sleep
. wahlberg seems less at hmeo inaddition tihs atomsphere
, bu he
' s still funn tothe watch
. i allso liekd thte subplot involving danny
' s father
; brian cox
' s peformance isnt powerfull
, adn his chracter makse a compelling moral compass fo danny
. bu tjhe film ultimatly fails
, mostly at tje h
ands ofthe insane incoherence adn overly
- familar acation scenes
. a complicated plot cin be succsessfull
, bu tyhe stopry needs tothe mkae sence wehn it
' s over
. tje corruptor never manages tothe mkea any sence
-
- it jstu keesh spinning outloud ofthe controll nutil
, finaly
, htere
' s nothing left tothe hold onthe tothe
.
