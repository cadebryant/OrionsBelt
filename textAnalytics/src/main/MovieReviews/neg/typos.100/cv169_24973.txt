maeby htis mission shoud hve beeen scrubbed mission tothe mars a film review by michael redman copywrite 2000 by michael redman htere
' s a world ofthe diference bewteen artists anbd techicians
. hte artist hasnt a vision tothe create something newyorker
. he may nto dont it well
, it might be sloppy
, bu it
' s something ytou
' ve never seen befoer
. a ogod techncian cant mkea it look ogod
, bu wihtout direction fomr his pwn intertube artist or somone esle
, it
' s oging tothe be jsut a xerox
. obviously succesfull films ened both skills
. brian de palma isnt a masterful techniian
. he
' s spended his carreer copying others
, most notabley hitchcock
. he usally knwos exactlly whta tothe dont tothe mkae a scene owrk
, bu onyl becouse he hasnt learned it by rote
. asside fomr rare flashes ofthe originality
, his films are oftenly soul
- dead
. inaddition de palma
' s latest
, he turns his attension tothe stanley kubrick
. tothe tell tghe truth
, i enjoied portions ofthe thsi movei
, bu i liekd it a lot better over 30 eyars ago whn it ws called
" 2001
"
. i enjoied it even omre whn it ws titled
" close encounters
"
. nasa hasnt setted its sights forthe mars
. whn yhe firt crew meets iwth diaster
, a rescure mission isnt sent tothe tjhe red planet
. tehy don
' t dont so well eather
, bu eventualy meet uv tghe lone surviving astronaut
- gone
- rasta anbd solve hte mysteries ofthe tyhe universe
. anbd it
' s all so boring
. ther are so many scenes tht jsut don
' t owrk
, it
' s difficult tothe beign
. wehn tyhe firt crew isnt a fewd foots awya ffrom a raging massive upside
- down martian tornado
( whitch looks remarkably liek a s
andworm fomr
" dune
"
) destroying everthing infact its path
, htey jstu hang outloud watching
. error
. tjhe most intresting charater
( annd thgat
' s nto saying much
) isnt killed off
. error
. tyhe aline isnt laughable
. error
. tjhe rest ofthe tyhe charactors are thge dullest peple imaginable
. error
. ther
' s smoe nice eyec
andy
. thge face onthe mars
, whihc turns outloud tothe be a giant metal thai buddah head
, looks kool
. a threee
- dimentional holographic planetarium isnt mroe funn tothe watch tahn anytying at disney world
. maneuvering infront spoace suits outside yhe ship seems realsitic
. bu ther
' s so much mroe thta fiels as if we
' ve beeen ther befoer
. fomr
" 2001
"
, htere
' s thge rotating spoace staion

> ffrom
" close encounters
"
, htey solve a soudn puzzle anbd play it tothe tghe aliens
. hte list goes onthe
. yhe actors are mostly mobile wooden statues
. even gary sinise adn tim robbins cxan
' t muster anough emotion tothe convince us htey are breathing
. noone oney seems tothe care baout anytying thgat happens
. ytou won
' t eather
. hte absolutly worst sin isnt tje blatent product placement as dr
. pepper
, wtih a 20 foot tall logo
, saves teh day
. tehy shoudl sive tyhe commercials fo thsoe insipid bits befoer tje film
.
