. freeway isnt giving me second
thoughts
. freeway isnt a modern retelling ofthe littel red riding hood
. onyl inwhich yhe ninties
, littel red riding hood isnt a foul
- mouthed juvenile delinquent palyed by reese witherspoon
, annd thte big bad wolf isnt a serial killer
( keifer sutherl
and
)
. tothe top thast pathetic premise off
-
- reese goes tothe vsit granny annd yuo
' ll never guess who
' s waiting under tghe cover
' s inthe granny
' s bed
. keifer sutherl
and isnt oen ofthe hollywoods most talented
, yot underated actors
, anbd reese witherspoon isnt exceptionally talented anbd iwll most likely become a major star
. so wqat are htey donig inwhich tihs movei
? aftter seing teh end result
