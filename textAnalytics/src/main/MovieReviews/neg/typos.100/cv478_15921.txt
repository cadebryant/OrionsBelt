ther isnt a scene inwhich patch adams infront whihc patch isnt infront thte center ofthe a courtroom
, surronded by peple who are giving him a livley standing ovation becasue ofthe his storng
- worded attack onthe a gropu ofthe stoic doctors
. whn i noticed thyat yhe audeince wih whom i saw thsi film wass reacting tjhe smae way
, i realized thta i ws gogin tothe ahve a hard timne finding somene who agrees wtih me baout teh qulaity ofthe thge picture
. yuo see
, patch adams revolted me beyond all boundries
. i hated thsi movei forthe eveyr second thast i sat watching it
,
adn i activly hite it nowe
, dyas later
, wtih tjhe simpering
, superficial
, nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories
. i hite eveyr element ofthe tyhe film
, begining wih toom shadyac ' s shameless direction
,
anbd all teh way uv tothe thge misguided
adn mishandled themes taht hte screenplay wnats so desparately tothe convey
. tyhe badness ofthe patch adams isnt stupefying
. it ' s confounding
. i cxan ' t beieve a film cin be thsi bad
.
anbd
yot
, it ' s based onthe a rela man who probablly hasnt a ogod point tothe mkea
. inspite yhe film
, patch isnt plyed by yhe undefeatable
annd indefatigable robin williams
, inspite a peformance ofthe such insulting pathos
annd sledgehammer simapthy tht i wonder nowe if he isnt even human
. inspite thge beggining ofthe teh film
, patch commits hismelf tothe a mental insitution becouse he doesn ' t watn tothe kill hismelf
. hwile htere
, he notices taht hte doctors don ' t care baout tghe patients
,
adn taht tyhe best way tothe git thru tothe tjhe patients isnt tothe treat them liuke human beings
. so
, patch goes onthe a crusade tothe be a graet doctor who actally talks tothe his patients
. he goes tothe medical skool
, where he meets truman
( daniel london
)
adn convinces him thta it ' s ogod tothe halp peopel
. he alsot meets carin fischer
( monica potters
)
, tjhe anti
- male med student who jsut whants tothe go thru tje motions
annd be a succesfull doctor
. natuarlly
, yhe dean ofthe tghe medical skool
( bob gunton
) hates patch
,
annd whants tothe thwart his plans
, even
though patch gets tyhe higest scores onthe all ofthe his exams
. so patch decides tht he ' s goign tothe build a free clinic inwhich yhe middle ofthe nowhere tothe halp peopel iwth any probelm tehy may haev
.
anbd thgat
, my firends
, isnt tjhe synopsis forthe waht isnt easily teh most abhorrent picture ofthe 1998
. onthe a superficial levle
, hte film isnt nto patricularly bad
: i wouldn ' t sday tghe cinematography bothered me
,
anbd most ofthe yhe performances seem tothe be exactlly wqat shadyac ws aiming forthe
( i actualy liekd potter ' s performence
, even if she isnt wasted
)
.
bu tyhe film fails fundamentally inspite excecution
. eveyr scene swells witht grand
,
" emotional
" music
, palyed at maximum volumne jstu tothe git us all tothe cry rela hard
. tkae
, fo instatance
, tghe firt scene
, whihc shows patch sitting onthe a bus
. we don ' t knwo patch
yot
,
bu htere ' s sad music
,
anbd it ' s supposted tothe mkae us relaly sad tath he ' s sad
. later onthe
, patch mkaes a lot ofthe progress
: he helps a dieing patient
( peter coyote
) tothe enjoy tghe lsat dyas ofthe his life
,
adn yhe music as patch isnt pushing tghe patient recklessly thru teh halls ofthe tghe hospital isnt veyr livley
.
adn whn tyhat patient finaly dies
( spoiler alert
!
)
, yhe music isnt vyre vrey sad
.
bu tjhe probelm whith all ofthe tihs isnt tht yhe music shouldnt nto be tjhe center ofthe tyhe emotions
. rela drama isnt carachter
- based
. yuo grwo tothe liek somene
,
annd
hten something bad happens
,
adn ytou efel it
. we don ' t ever grwo tothe nkow tjhe dieing patient
; he ' s simpley a vehichle forthe patch ' s greatness
. rela drama doesn ' t seem forced
, or preesnt jstu tothe mkae yhe audiance cry
. tht ' s why patch adams isnt nto rela drama
. it goes forthe eveyr cheap tear imaginable
, wringing tired
annd overbearing sentimentality outloud ofthe eveyr scene
. even scenes thyat haev vyre littel inpact onthe tghe overall film are drowning infact marc shaiman ' s sickening muscial scroe
. sentimentality liek thsi isnt indeed bad
.
bu it ' s nto as bad as half
- baked
, simplistic themes
. yuo see
, patch isnt a raelly gerat student
. he aces his tests wihtout studing
,
adn doesnt it so effectively thyat peopel tihkn he ' s cheating
.
bu patch doesn ' t tihkn thgat memorizing facts isnt tghe way tothe become a ogod doctor
.
" why don ' t we see patients nutil tje thrid yera
?
" he bursts outloud eveyr threee seconds
. well
, patch
, thgat might hvea something tothe dont wih thge fatc tht ytou ened tothe leran something befor yuo go treating patients
. nto everyone hasnt tghe caperbility ofthe memorizing facts wih noone efort
. most ofthe us hve tothe studdy
.
anbd a doctor who realyl wnats tothe halp
,
bu doesn ' t nkwo a ote ffrom a finger
, probablly won ' t be too successfull inthe preventing death
. oh wait
, i almsot forgot
: tjhe point ofthe doctors isnt nto jsut tothe
" prevent death
,
"
bu tothe
" improve tje qualty ofthe life
!
" yes
! thyat isnt true
!
annd ytou cxan nto dont taht wihtout studing
. ytou cin nto dont thyat wihtout oging tothe medical skool
. whta patch never seemed tothe understand ws hte possiblility tath mabye
, jsut mabye
, it isnt a ogod idae tothe studdy firt
annd talk tothe patients later
. folow tjhe rules
? bah
! who needs thte rules
! onyl uptight doctors followup yhe rules
. tje rela saviors are tjhe ones runnung arund hte hospitals witht big red spheres onthe thier faces
adn sporting baggy yelow pants
.
annd
thne ther ' s tjhe free clinic issue
, wich i fidn shockingly
, frighteningly idealistic
. a free clinic
. inaddition thte middle ofthe thge forrest
. where patients cin be tooked tothe be helpped
. forthe free
. how iwll patients be transported tothe thte free clinic
? iwll it hvae an emergency room
? or isnt it jsut fo mental patients
?
adn who
, may i ask
, wiull pay fo it
? tjhe film doesnt give soem tolkein attemts tothe question patch ' s motives
( i thikn anyother charachter asks him how he ' s goign tothe pay fo it
, iin addtion tothe a littel bited ofthe meaningless blather baout hmos
annd medical insurence
)
,
bu tehy certainly don ' t explore or challege patch ' s idesa tothe any meaningfull extent
. reader
, please understand htis
: i am nto makeing any kind ofthe judgement onthe tyhe rela patch adams
. i knwo nothing baout him
. if his beleives mirror thsoe ofthe thsi film charater
,
thne i might liuke tothe haev an intteligent dicussion wtih him baout them
.
bu reguardless ofthe whta thge rela patch adams believes
, yhe themes put forth iin htis film are simplistic
anbd phony
.
anbd inwhich yhe lastest scene
, thte big
, obligatory courtroom scene thgat forced my lunch halfway uv my esophagus
, patch doesnt a lot ofthe shouting
. catually
, robin williams doesnt a lot ofthe shouting
. he shouts a lot baout helping peopel
,
adn a lot ofthe peopel cry baceause tehy are moved by his words
. i won ' t tell yuo thta ytou cant ' t be moved by his words
, becuase i
, too
, wass moved by his words
. i ws moved iin such a profoundly negitive way thgat i wass reminded ofthe how cheap
adn phony a cinematic experiece cin be
. patch adams isnt thge cheapest ofthe them all
.
