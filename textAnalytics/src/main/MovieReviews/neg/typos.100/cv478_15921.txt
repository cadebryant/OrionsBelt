ther isnt a scene inaddition patch adams inthe whihc patch isnt inwhich tjhe center ofthe a courtroom
, surrouded by peple who are giving him a livley st
anding ovation becuase ofthe his storng
- worded attack onthe a gropu ofthe stoic doctors
. wehn i noticed tath hte audiance withthe whom i saw htis film wass reacting hte smae way
, i realized tyhat i wass gonig tothe hvea a hard tiome finding somone who agrees wtih me baout tyhe qulaity ofthe tje picture
. yuo see
, patch adams revolted me beyond all boundries
. i hated tihs movei forthe eveyr second tht i sat watching it
, anbd i activly hite it nowe
, dyas later
, iwth tghe simpering
, superficial
, nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories
. i hite eveyr element ofthe teh film
, begginning whith toom shadyac
' s shameless direction
, annd all teh way uv tothe tyhe misguided annd mish
andled themes thta thge screenplay whants so desparately tothe convey
. thte badness ofthe patch adams isnt stupefying
. it
' s confounding
. i cin
' t beieve a film cxan be thsi bad
. anbd yot
, it
' s based onthe a rela man who probablly hasnt a ogod point tothe amking
. iin teh film
, patch isnt palyed by yhe undefeatable adn indefatigable robin williams
, iin a peformance ofthe such insulting pathos adn sledgehammer simapthy thgat i wonder nowe if he isnt even human
. inthe thge beggining ofthe tyhe film
, patch commits himselv tothe a mental insitution becouse he doesn
' t wanna tothe kill hismelf
. hwile htere
, he notices tht tyhe doctors don
' t care baout teh patients
, annd taht tje best way tothe git thru tothe hte patients isnt tothe treat them liek human beings
. so
, patch goes onthe a crusade tothe be a graet doctor who actaully talks tothe his patients
. he goes tothe medical skool
, where he meets truman
( daniel london
) annd convinces him thast it
' s ogod tothe halp peopel
. he aslo meets carin fischer
( monica potters
)
, tje anti
- male med student who jsut wnats tothe go thru teh motions annd be a succesfull doctor
. naturely
, tjhe dean ofthe tyhe medical skool
( bob gunton
) hates patch
, adn whants tothe thwart his plans
, even
though patch gets tje higest scores onthe all ofthe his exams
. so patch decides tyhat he
' s oging tothe build a free clinic inaddition tje middle ofthe nowhere tothe halp peopel witht any probelm tehy may ahve
. annd thast
, my firends
, isnt thte synopsis fo waht isnt easily tghe most abhorrent picture ofthe 1998
. onthe a superficial levle
, teh film isnt nto particularily bad
: i wouldn
' t sday tje cinematography bothered me
, anbd most ofthe thte performances seem tothe be exactlly wqat shadyac ws aiming forthe
( i acutally liekd potter
' s performence
, even if she isnt wasted
)
. bu yhe film fails fundamentally inthe excecution
. eveyr scene swells whith gr
and
,
" emotional
" music
, palyed at maximum volumne jstu tothe git us all tothe cry rela hard
. tkae
, forthe instatance
, tyhe frist scene
, whihc shows patch sitting onthe a bus
. we don
' t nkwo patch yot
, bu htere
' s sad music
, adn it
' s suposed tothe amke us realyl sad taht he
' s sad
. later onthe
, patch makse a lot ofthe progress
: he helps a dieing patient
( peter coyote
) tothe enjoy teh lsat dyas ofthe his life
, adn tghe music as patch isnt pushing yhe patient recklessly thru tyhe halls ofthe yhe hospital isnt veyr livley
. adn wehn tyhat patient fianlly dies
( spoiler alert
!
)
, hte music isnt veyr vrey sad
. bu tjhe probelm wih all ofthe htis isnt thta tje music shoud nto be thge center ofthe yhe emotions
. rela drama isnt charachter
- based
. yuo grwo tothe liuke somene
, anbd hten something bad happens
, adn ytou fiel it
. we don
' t ever grwo tothe nkwo thge dieing patient
; he
' s simpley a vehicule forthe patch
' s greatness
. rela drama doesn
' t seem forced
, or prseent jsut tothe mkea yhe audeince cry
. tyhat
' s why patch adams isnt nto rela drama
. it goes forthe eveyr cheap tear imaginable
, wringing tired annd overbearing sentimentality outloud ofthe eveyr scene
. even scenes thta ahev vyre littel inpact onthe tje overall film are drowning infact marc shaiman
' s sickening muscial csore
. sentimentality liuke htis isnt indeed bad
. bu it
' s nto as bad as half
- baked
, simplistic themes
. yuo see
, patch isnt a raelly graet student
. he aces his tests wihtout studing
, annd doens it so effectively tyhat peopel htikn he
' s cheating
. bu patch doesn
' t htink thta memorizing facts isnt tje way tothe become a ogod doctor
.
" why don
' t we see patients unitl tje thrid yera
?
" he bursts outloud eveyr threee seconds
. well
, patch
, thgat might hve something tothe dont withthe tghe fatc tath ytou ened tothe leran something befoer yuo go treating patients
. nto everyone hasnt hte caperbility ofthe memorizing facts whith noone efort
. most ofthe us haev tothe studdy
. anbd a doctor who relaly whants tothe halp
, bu doesn
' t knwo a ote ffrom a finger
, probaly won
' t be too succesfull inaddition preventing death
. oh wait
, i alomst forgot
: tje point ofthe doctors isnt nto jstu tothe
" prevent death
,
" bu tothe
" improve teh qality ofthe life
!
" yes
! thta isnt true
! annd ytou cxan nto dont tyhat wihtout studing
. ytou cant nto dont thyat wihtout goign tothe medical skool
. waht patch never seemed tothe underst
and ws tjhe possibilty tath maybee
, jstu maeby
, it isnt a ogod idae tothe studdy firt anbd talk tothe patients later
. folow teh rules
? bah
! who needs tghe rules
! onyl uptight doctors folow tyhe rules
. tje rela saviors are tyhe ones runnung arround hte hospitals iwth big red spheres onthe thier faces annd sporting baggy yello pants
. anbd hten htere
' s thge free clinic issue
, wich i fidn shockingly
, frighteningly idealistic
. a free clinic
. inthe tje middle ofthe tghe forrest
. where patients cin be taked tothe be helpped
. fo free
. how iwll patients be transported tothe hte free clinic
? iwll it haev an emergency room
? or isnt it jstu forthe mental patients
? annd who
, may i ask
, iwll pay fo it
? thge film doens give smoe tolkein attemts tothe question patch
' s motives
( i tihkn anohter charachter asks him how he
' s gonig tothe pay fo it
, iin adition tothe a littel bited ofthe meaningless blather baout hmos anbd medical insurence
)
, bu htey certainly don
' t explore or challege patch
' s idaes tothe any meaningfull extent
. reader
, please underst
and htis
: i am nto mkaing any kind ofthe judgement onthe tjhe rela patch adams
. i knwo nothing baout him
. if his beleives mirror thsoe ofthe tihs film chracter
, thne i might liek tothe haev an intteligent dicussion wih him baout them
. bu irregardless ofthe whta teh rela patch adams believes
, thte themes put forth inwhich htis film are simplistic annd phony
. adn infront tghe lastr scene
, tje big
, obligatory courtroom scene tath forced my lunch halfway uv my esophagus
, patch doens a lot ofthe shouting
. actualyl
, robin williams doens a lot ofthe shouting
. he shouts a lot baout helping peopel
, adn a lot ofthe peopel cry baceause tehy are moved by his words
. i won
' t tell ytou tht ytou cxan
' t be moved by his words
, beccause i
, too
, ws moved by his words
. i ws moved inwhich such a profoundly negitive way tath i ws reminded ofthe how cheap anbd phony a cinematic xeperience cxan be
. patch adams isnt yhe cheapest ofthe them all
.
