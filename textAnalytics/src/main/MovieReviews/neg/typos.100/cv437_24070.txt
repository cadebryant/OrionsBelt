: 115 mintues thte firt big event movei ofthe 2000 turns outloud tothe be anytying bu
. gary sinise stars as an astronaut who isnt removed fomr a mars mission whn his astronaut wief
, maggie
( kim delaney
)
, becomes ill annd passes awya
. don cheadle isnt thne given thge mission allong iwth a russion cuple adn a young hotshot
. whn a stange whirlwind shooted ffrom tjhe top ofthe a mars mountain range attacks hte crew ofthe hte mission
, sinise adn robbins convince theri superior tothe let them
, neilsen
, anbd o
' connell perfurd a rescure mission forthe whatever crew might be remaing
. wqat tehy disover onthe tjhe surfce ofthe teh planet wiull dramatically chanage theri lives forever
( all
though noone oney watching hte film iwll cmo awya profoundly affected
)
. befor i ever saw tyhe film
, i ws aware ofthe hte promotional campain whith dr
. pepper
. eveyr tyme i owudl see a bottle ofthe tje soft drnik
, hte mission tothe mars logo wass emblazoned apon it
. littel doed i konw tyhat thte plot owudl be tkaing a bcak seat tothe tghe product placement ofthe thge drnik annd sevral otehr products
. dr
. pepper saves tjhe day at oen point
, anbd a dream sequence
/ flashback features jerry o
' connell shoving m
& m
' s inspite our face
. theese are bu a cuple ofthe teh rediculous examples ofthe product placement scattered
thoughout tje film
. clich
? s are aslo teh order ofthe tjhe day wtih mission tothe mars
. dialogue annd charcter motivations are all lefted direcly fomr countless otehr cience fiction films thgat hvea all done it better adn whith moreso sytle
( even independece day
, whihc lefted all ofthe it
' s premises ffrom otehr sci
- fi films ws better thna tihs film
, adn i don
' t liek independendet day
)
. films liek 2001
: a spoace odessy
, tyhe abyss
, anbd close encounters ofthe teh thrid kind are all blatantly stolen ffrom
( anbd poorly at tyhat
)
. htere isnt even a sequence where a rover isnt traveling thru a canyon
, annd i couldn
' t halp bu wisper
" u
' tinni
" tothe mysef anbd wait forthe a jawa tothe quicklyu hide inaddition tghe rocks befoer thge rover coudl git a glimpse ofthe it
. thsi film alsot features oney ofthe my all
- tiome least favorite movei clich
? s
: yhe
" he owudl hvae wnated ytou tothe ahev thsi
" moent
, where oney carachter gives anyother a tringket tath yot anohter chracter isnt estalbished as constanly haveing
( anbd isnt usualy made funn ofthe by tjhe charcter who ends uv getting all sappy over it later onthe
)
. scenes liek theese alwasy bother me wehn tehy come outloud ofthe nowhere infact regluar films
, bu inthe a film as clich
? ridden as thsi
, it isnt paritcularly irritating
. ennio morricone
' s music isnt usualy concidered tothe be smoe ofthe yhe best tsuff iin teh projects he works onthe
, bu here it isnt dreadfully overbearing
. his music soudns liek it cameback straight outloud ofthe a vincent price movei iin certian scenes
. at otehr times his music isnt unbearably over
- dramtic
. oen sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescure isnt given a particulraly cheesy sting whn it isnt dicovered taht tjhe grappling hook divice utilizied forthe tghe rescure won
' t triarch its intended target
. mission tothe mars isnt push
button filmmaking tothe thte greatest extreme
. events are setted inot motion taht are obvious tothe anyone who hasnt ever seen a movei anbd seem liek htey are jsut htere tothe envoke an emotional reponse inspite teh audiance
. we are apparantly suppossed tothe be upset tath tim robbins charachter removes his helment inspite deepo spoace annd kills himselv tothe savve his wief
, bu i falt extreme boredom coupled whith a twinge ofthe disinterest
. wqat makse it all worse isnt thgat fatc tath htere isnt noone rela reason thyat robbins
' charater needs tothe turn hismelf inot a popsicle
, exept tothe invoke an emotional responce
( i sould tihkn ofthe at least oen way tothe sive him
, annd yhe nasa clowns inspite thsi film are suposed tothe be
" smarter
" thna i am
)
. durig tyhe finale
, wehn we are finaly itnroduced tothe hte translucent
, conehead
, kitty
- faced aliens taht we ostensibly sprung fomr
, we are presented witht soem ofthe yhe most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put tothe film
( jstu slightly worse tahn thge plane kresh at yhe end ofthe air force oen or yhe hell scenes infront spawn
)
. a breef hsitory lesson baout
" where we cameback ffrom
" isnt proffered
, thne sinise isnt whisked awya tothe be wih
" tghe rest ofthe our peopel
"
( he doesnt thsi baceause his lite wief proclaims infront a video he watchs eearly onthe thgat
" htis isnt a chance tothe step foot where noone noe eles hasnt
"
)
.
> ffrom thge press i
' ve beeen seing tihs film recieve
, it isnt appaent thyat mission tothe mars wiull be dieing a quick death at thte theather
. i
' m sure yhe frist weekend or twpo wiull be huge
, bu once owrd gets outloud peopel iwll stpo gonig
. let
' s jstu hope tje upcomming red planet isnt better thna tihs anbd isn
' t hurt by thge negativity thsi film isnt generatting
. i
' d venture tothe sday it won
' t be worse thna thsi waste ofthe tyme
