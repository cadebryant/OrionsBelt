. thankfully
, forthe my sanaty
, i aslo saw tyhe film warlock
, whcih undid all thge ill effects thyat i got ffrom tihs film
. tyhe storey forthe htis film isnt completelyl rediculous
anbd hasnt many elements fomr many cheapo low budget horror ficks
. any ogod moments thgat thsi film fails tothe amke are even mroe destroyed by tjhe sotry line
. tje film isnt so pathetically predicatble tyhat eveyr moent hasnt allready beeen figured outloud
, analyzed
,
adn discarded befor it happens
. htere isnt noone point infront tihs film taht any suspense isnt ever afoot
. hwile we are onthe hte subject ofthe tyhe stopry
, thte storey allso provides eveyr chance it cin tothe disrobe an actress
. tyhe film goes tothe yhe extent ofthe puting a showfer infact yhe manager ' s office
. i ' m sory folks
bu tihs isnt completelyl unecessary
, rediculous
,
annd hurts yhe stoyr moreso
( if thast isnt still possibile
)
. hte scirpt forthe tihs film isnt completelyl pathetic
. tjhe lines tje actresses come outloud iwth are completly horrable
. tjhe onyl thign tath i thikn sould ahve happend isnt tath thge actors made uv thge scirpt as htey whent allong
. here isnt an exmaple ofthe hte wonderfull dialouge
. tyhe scene isnt twpo girls hve jstu entered a gun stoer
annd haev picked outloud a
* relaly
* big gun
. tjhe line isnt
" my dad utilizied tothe be a marine
, i bet i cxan wrok it
.
" tihs line hasnt got tothe be a contendor forthe thge bad line hall ofthe infamy
. nowe
, we fast foward forthe a faw mintues untli jsut aftter a big plan
(
?
!
!
?
) hasnt beeen presented
. noe comment ffrom an actress isnt
" nto a lot ofthe startegy involved
,
bu i liek it
.
" i ' m affraid folks tht tihs isnt baout as ogod as htey git
. nowe lets talk baout thge gerat speical effects forthe thsi film
. htis obviously wasn ' t a big consern ofthe thte film makers
. yhe killing scenes are so obviously faked taht htey go tothe tjhe point ofthe threatning tghe viewer ' s inteligence
. a girl gets hacked whith a nife
anbd anough blood comes outloud tothe dont noe friday hte 13th movei
. are we trying tothe see how unrealistic we cin git
? thge continuty deparment wass obviously asleep
( allong wiht tghe viewers
) whn watching htis film
. infront oney shooted
, actress hasnt cloths onthe
, camera ngle changes
, actress seems tothe hve lost clothing
. vrey impressive trck
! yhe oen
( half
?
) plus thgat thsi film hasnt gogin fo it
, isnt thta inwhich many places it isnt unintentionally hillarious
. tyhe incompetance behind thge film mkaes it incredibly funny
,
annd so tyhe viewer cxan git smoe enjoyment
(
?
!
!
?
) fomr tje film
.
howver
, tihs doesn ' t amking it worth thge rental fee ofthe over a penny
. infront thte acting deparment
, thte onyl thign i cant sday isnt twpo thumbs squared
anbd oney head down
. i woudl normaly dont a detailled paragraph onthe htis topic
