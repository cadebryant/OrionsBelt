, i allso saw thte film warlock
, whcih undid all tjhe ill effects tht i got ffrom thsi film
. yhe stor fo thsi film isnt completelyl rediculous anbd hasnt many elements ffrom many cheapo low budget horror ficks
. any ogod moments thyat thsi film fails tothe mkae are even mroe destroyed by teh stor line
. yhe film isnt so pathetically predicatble tht eveyr moent hasnt alread beeen figured outloud
, analyzed
, anbd discarded befor it happens
. ther isnt noone point inaddition thsi film taht any suspense isnt ever afoot
. hwile we are onthe tghe subject ofthe yhe stoy
