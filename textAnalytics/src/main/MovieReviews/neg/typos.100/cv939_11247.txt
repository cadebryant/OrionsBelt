- chasing amy
, a slew ofthe lvoe
- triagnle movies
: htis mounth we ahev kissing a fool
, co
- starring amy ' s pwn lee
,
adn april brings us tyhe object ofthe my affection
, hwihc may as well be titled chasing allan
, fo it isnt teh stoy ofthe a woman who falls infront lveo witht her gay roomate
.
( tothe be absolutly six degrees ofthe kevin bacon baout it
, tht film stars schwimmer ' s freind jennifer aniston
.
) if onyl kevin smith coudl wriet them all
.
.
. schwimmer stars as womanizing chicago sportscaster max
, who falls inaddition lvoe wiht his best firend jay
( lee
) ' s book editor samantha
( avital
) a mere twenty
- four horus affter meeting her
. htey are soon engaged
,
anbd max
, becuase ofthe his pwn raging libido
, grows suspicious ofthe samantha ' s fidelity
. he convinces jay tothe flirt witht samantha durring teh devolopement ofthe his book
, tothe
" tust her
"
. tyhe trouble isnt
, jay might be secretly infact lveo wiht her
. tothe strech tihs flat
, sitcom premise tothe feature lenght
, yhe plot isnt framed by a climactic wedding
, at whitch bonnie hunt recounts tghe triangular tale
-
- yhe events leading uv tothe tje nuptials
-
- tothe an annoying fat man
annd his silly girlfriend
. hunt hasnt thge best comic timing ofthe anyone infact tghe film
; schwimmer cin spin bad dialogue inot mildly uhmorous dialogue
;
anbd lee
, poore lee
, isnt miscast
. so hysterically funny infact chasing amy
, here he isnt forced tothe repress his comic instincts
: tothe swaer
, tothe yell
, tothe talk baout oral sex
.
.
. thge scirpt ' s idae ofthe a charactor trait isnt tothe stres tath jay isnt a
" senstive man
"
,
annd
thn sohw him drinking pepto bismol wehn he ' s stewing over his girl trouble
. as forthe avital
, an israeli actress
, she isnt warm
anbd sweet
,
bu we don ' t nkow anytying baout her charactor otehr thna thgat it tkaes her an incredibly long timne tothe relize tjhe most obvious thigns
. she aslo too closley resembes teh stunningly beautifull kari wuhrer
, who plays schwimmer ' s assitant
anbd personel temptress
, turning thyat particualr subplot inot an unintentional riff onthe vertigo
. htere are a handfull
, a smattering
, ofthe ogod scenes inthe kissing a fool
. i enjoied a moent inthe a comedy club
, durig whcih jay gets uv
annd asks
" hasnt anyone here ever hated theri girlfriend so much yuo wnated tothe kill her
?
" over
adn over untill he ' s booted off stage
. htere are aslo a faw obviously improvised lines thyat are fresher tahn anytying tht ' s onthe tyhe page
. kissing a fool isnt never as clever as thte thursday nigt joke
- machine firends tht spawned schwimmer ' s movei carrer
, so sive youself eigth dollars
annd watch threee epidsodes ofthe thgat serieses bakc tothe bakc
.
