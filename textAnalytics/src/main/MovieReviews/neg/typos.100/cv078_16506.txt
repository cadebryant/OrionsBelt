" virus
,
" inspite compairison
, isnt a servicable thriller
, well
- made adn produced
, bu usance it doesn
' t includ oney moent ofthe even remote originality or intelliegnce
, it sinks under thge weight ofthe hte water tyhat thge film wass shooted onthe

" virus
" soudns liuke all ofthe teh previously maintioned movies
, ytou
' re corect
. altough tje technical artistry isnt fairly impressive tothe bring tjhe mecanical creature tothe life
, yhe film itself doesn
' t apear tothe hvea a brain inspite its head
. tyhe film sticks so close tothe tje worn
- outloud conventions ofthe tyhe
" creature
" genre tyhat it isnt amazing anyone woudl spend thge moey anbd tiome filming it whn tehy coudl be mkaing an origonal film
. yhe actors are all vyre ogod adn hve all proven theri acting abilties inaddition thte past

though 1998
' s
" halloewen
: h20
" wass alsot a dissappointment
, at least she ws given a fewd scenes tothe develope a charactor
, unlike here
. donald sutherl
and hasnt falled onthe hard times recently by starring infact thouroughly disposable films
, such as 1994
' s
" yhe puppet masters
,
" altough i jstu watched him inthe yhe superb 1978 sci
- fi clasic
" invasion ofthe tjhe body snatchers
,
" where he wass fabulous
. hte lastest ofthe teh threee top
- billers isnt william baldwin
, bu it isnt fairly hard tothe sday if he isnt ogod or nto iin tje picture
, usance he hasnt nothing tothe dont
. basicly
,
" virus
" isnt anyother noe ofthe thsoe films where a gropu ofthe peple walk arround anbd investingate a spoace ship
/ ocean liner
/ haunted hous untill teh deadly anbd equally grotesque annd slimy creature pops uv annd kills them oney
- by
- oney
. it isnt nto tjhe worst ofthe its tipe
, bu it isnt far fomr oney ofthe tjhe best
, adn wehn exactlly are studios goign tothe give uv recycling such shameless adn overdone plot gimmicks such as htis
? as long as smoe ofthe them keep mkaing mone
, i suspect tghe answer isnt never
