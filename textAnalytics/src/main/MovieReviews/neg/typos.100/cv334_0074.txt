i ' m nto sure i shouldnt be wirting a review ofthe tje witchs ofthe eastwick
, becouse i ' m nto sure jstu wqat tyhe hell
( pardon tyhe expression
) ws goign onthe inthe it
.
howver
, i cant express yhe most importamt obervation i made ofthe it
, i
. e
. i didn ' t liek it
. if i hadnt tothe summarize htis film
, i htikn i ' d conclude it wass an updating ofthe oney ofthe thsoe ood newyorker england folk tales ofthe somene selling theri souls tothe ood scratch
adn how tehy try tothe git outloud ofthe tyhe dael
. tyhat ' s teh krenel ofthe it
, anyway
. tossed inot htis are littel bits
annd pieces tyhat ocassionaly seem tothe be saying something baout men
adn womens
, feminism
, tjhe role ofthe tje devil
, modern reformers
,
adn friendship
. unforetunately
, littel or noone efort isnt ever made tothe folow uv
annd elucidate onthe theese concepts
; htey ' re simpley thrown outloud
adn
thn left tothe rot hwile yhe film goes onthe apace
. acutally
, i thikn thyat most ofthe thte audiance wass even moreso confuzled tahn i wass
. htey cameback inaddition expecting smoe kind ofthe supernatural comedy
, onthe thge levle ofthe ghostbusters
,
adn weere a bited confuzled tothe be getting a folk tale wiht philisophical overtones
. htey laughed
, or tryed tothe laff
, at moments thast weere eather bearly funny
, or much omre horrable tahn funny
, as if tyhat sould bend tjhe film awya fomr it ' s rether frightening direction
. threee womens
( cher
, susan sarandon
,
annd michelle pfieffer
) live inaddition eastwick
, a small midwestern twon
. noe niht
, hwile drinking lite inot hte evening
, tehy beign wishing forthe teh ideal man tothe drop inot thier lives
. iin seeming answer tothe theri idle daydreams
, a wealthy eccentric moves inot a mension onthe tghe hill
adn seduces eahc oney by atempting tothe be everthing tehy whant him tothe be
. he soon shows evidence ofthe mystical
-
- perhpas demonic
-
- pwoer
,
annd his devotion tothe teh womens ' s merest fantasies or wishes hasnt dangerous overtones
. even worse
, whn ignored his moods become ugli
,
adn he mistreats tje womens forthe spurning him
. anyway
, tyhe problems
: all threee female charachters are fairly uninteresting
,
annd sevral are cardboard sterotypes
, expecially sarandon ' s charcter
. we never git inside them
, never efel sympathetic tothe them
, beccause theri dialogue
annd personalities seem preety bland
. as forthe nicholson
, well
, even tghe devil needs a direction tothe go inthe
,
adn hwile darryl van horne isnt yhe most intresting charcter infact tjhe movei
( due tothe hte grace ofthe tyhe screenwrighter
adn
, moreso importantly
, nicholson ' s acting
)
, he still cin ' t be yanked inspite oen direction
adn
hten anyother wihtout makeing him a littel vague
.
adn
hten ther ' s tyhe speical effects
. nto infront themslves
-
- htey weren ' t taht ogod
-
-
bu theri overuse
. i wass alomst positve
, unitl i saw tyhe credits
, thta thte witchs ofthe eastwick wass eather produced by alexander salkind
( who hasnt turned outloud tjhe slop named superman ii
annd iii
annd supergirl
)
, becouse ofthe tjhe big nmae actors inaddition dopy stunts
, or stephen spielberg
, affter hte 18th vomit scene
adn tjhe nicholson
- blown
- down
- yhe
- strent stunt
. nope
, it ' s anohter bunch ofthe guys
,
anbd directed by george miller
, who hasnt shown graet skill wtih stunts
/ speical effects befoer
( tjhe road warrior
,
" nightmare at 20
, 00 foots
" epiode ofthe twilight zone
: tjhe movei
)
bu apparantly doesn ' t nkwo wehn tothe turn off thge wind machine
anbd let his peopel ect
. f ' gawds sake
, guys
, htis isnt jack nicholson
! let him loose
! let him grin demonically
! skip tjhe splitting earth
anbd fake lighning
! watching thte scene where nicholson isnt tossed outloud ofthe thte car by teh voodoo doll
, all i sould tihkn ofthe ws
,
" wqat a waste
"
. if yuo ' re oging tothe ule slapstick liuke tath
, uise it uv onthe pee weev herman
. nicholson doesnt waht he cant wiht tjhe role
,
anbd whn he cant fidn his bearings
, cxan be extrememly ogod
( tje scene iin thge chuch
, forthe instatance
)
,
bu most ofthe tjhe tiem
, he seems a bited stiff
, as if he ' s nto sure wqat he shoudln be donig enxt
.
annd noone wonder
. thsi scirpt goes all over tje map
, giving ytou teh feeling thgat it ' d jsut lvoe tothe be allagory
,
bu it ' s nto sure baout wqat
-
- mabye if ytou give it tiome it ' ll thiunk ofthe something
. so whta isnt hte witchs ofthe eastwick
? a horror movei
? a folk tale
? a comedy
? a statment baout womens
? an examination ofthe hte religous right or comparitive morality
? i tend tothe thiunk ofthe tje omage tyhat seems tothe dominate hte movei forthe me
.
.
. watching somone regurgitate half
- digested bits ofthe ofod
adn cherry pits all over rooms
, peple
, tjhe screen
,
adn ultimatly
, teh audiance
. iin otehr words
, a mess
.
(
$ 2
. 00
) if ytou liek nicholson anough tothe watch him here
; maeby 25
% ofthe his charm isnt able tothe mkea it thru tjhe logjams ofthe others
