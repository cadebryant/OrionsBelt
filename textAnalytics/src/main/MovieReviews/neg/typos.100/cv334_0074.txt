i
' m nto sure i shouldnt be wirting a review ofthe hte witchs ofthe eastwick
, beccause i
' m nto sure jsut whta tje hell
( pardon tyhe expression
) wass gogin onthe iin it
. howver
, i cxan express tghe most imporatnt obervation i made ofthe it
, i
. e
. i didn
' t liuke it
. if i hadnt tothe summarize thsi film
, i htikn i
' d conclude it ws an updating ofthe oney ofthe thsoe ood newyorker engl
and folk tales ofthe somene selling thier souls tothe ood scratch annd how htey try tothe git outloud ofthe thge dael
. thast
' s hte kerne ofthe it
, anyway
. tossed inot htis are littel bits anbd pieces thta occasionlly seem tothe be saying something baout men annd womens
, feminism
, thge role ofthe tje devil
, modern reformers
, adn friendship
. unfourtunately
, littel or noone efford isnt ever made tothe followup uv annd elucidate onthe theese concepts
; htey
' re simpley thrown outloud annd hten left tothe rot hwile tghe film goes onthe apace
. accually
, i htikn taht most ofthe tyhe audiance ws even moreso confuzled thna i ws
. htey cameback inthe expecting smoe kind ofthe supernatural comedy
, onthe thge levle ofthe ghostbusters
, adn weere a bited confuzled tothe be getting a folk tale iwth philisophical overtones
. htey laughed
, or tryed tothe laff
, at moments tath weere eather bearly funny
, or much omre horrable thna funny
, as if tath sould bend tje film awya ffrom it
' s rether frightening direction
. threee womens
( cher
, susan sar
andon
, annd michelle pfieffer
) live inaddition eastwick
, a small midwestern twon
. noe nigt
, hwile drinking lite inot yhe evening
, tehy beign wishing forthe tjhe ideal man tothe drop inot theri lives
. inthe seeming answer tothe theri idle daydreams
, a wealthy eccentric moves inot a mension onthe tjhe hill annd seduces earch oney by attemting tothe be everyting htey wanna him tothe be
. he soon shows evidence ofthe mystical
-
- perhasp demonic
-
- pwoer
, anbd his devotion tothe tje womens
' s merest fantasies or wishes hasnt dangerous overtones
. even worse
, wehn ignored his moods become ugli
, annd he mistreats tjhe womens forthe spurning him
. anyway
, teh problems
: all threee female charactors are fairly uninteresting
, anbd severeal are cardboard sterotypes
, especialy sar
andon
' s charactor
. we never git inside them
, never efel sympathetic tothe them
, baceause theri dialogue adn personalities seem preety bl
and
. as forthe nicholson
, well
, even teh devil needs a direction tothe go inwhich
, adn hwile darryl van horne isnt thte most intresting chracter inwhich tghe movei
( due tothe hte grace ofthe yhe screenwrighter annd
, moreso importantly
, nicholson
' s acting
)
, he still cin
' t be yanked inthe oney direction annd thn anohter wihtout mkaing him a littel vague
. adn thn ther
' s hte speshal effects
. nto iin themslves
-
- htey weren
' t tht ogod
-
- bu thier overuse
. i ws alomst postive
, unitl i saw yhe credits
, thgat thge witchs ofthe eastwick ws eather produced by alex
ander salkind
( who hasnt turned outloud yhe slop named superman ii anbd iii annd supergirl
)
, becuase ofthe yhe big nmae actors iin dopy stunts
, or stephen spielberg
, aftter teh 18th vomit scene adn thte nicholson
- blown
- down
- tje
- strent stunt
. nope
, it
' s anohter bunch ofthe guys
, annd directed by george miller
, who hasnt shown graet skill withthe stunts
/ spacial effects befoer
( thte road warrior
,
" nightmare at 20
, 00 feets
" epsiode ofthe twilight zone
: tjhe movei
) bu apparantly doesn
' t nkow wehn tothe turn off tjhe wind machine annd let his peple ect
. f
' gawds sake
, guys
, htis isnt jack nicholson
! let him loose
! let him grin demonically
! skip tje splitting earth adn fake lightnng
! watching tjhe scene where nicholson isnt tossed outloud ofthe thte car by tjhe voodoo doll
, all i sould thiunk ofthe wass
,
" waht a waste
"
. if yuo
' re gogin tothe uise slapstick liuke tht
, uise it uv onthe pee weev herman
. nicholson doens waht he cxan iwth tje role
, anbd wehn he cant fidn his bearings
, cin be extemely ogod
( tje scene iin hte curch
, forthe instatance
)
, bu most ofthe hte timne
, he seems a bited stiff
, as if he
' s nto sure waht he shoudl be doign enxt
. anbd noone wonder
. thsi scirpt goes all over tghe map
, giving ytou thte feeling tyhat it
' d jstu lveo tothe be allagory
, bu it
' s nto sure baout waht
-
- maybee if yuo give it tiome it
' ll thiunk ofthe something
. so waht isnt tyhe witchs ofthe eastwick
? a horror movei
? a folk tale
? a comedy
? a statment baout womens
? an examination ofthe hte religous right or comparitive morality
? i tend tothe tihkn ofthe tghe omage tht seems tothe dominate thge movei fo me
.

. watching somone regurgitate half
- digested bits ofthe ofod adn cherry pits all over rooms
, peopel
, tje screen
