kate
( jennifer aniston
) isnt hvaing soem problems
. it appears thge twenty
- eight yera ood isnt nto hapyp wtih her slow progression uv hte comany ladder
, annd her lveo life apparantly leaves something tothe be desired
. she lerans taht her problems are realted
, as teh owner ofthe her advertising agency
, mr
. mercer
( kevin dunn
)
, explains tothe her tht her single status doens nto bode well whith tyhe comapany
. her freedom owudl amke her mroe likely tothe leave yhe comapany
, tkaing clients wtih her
. a solution presents itself infront nick
( jay mohr
)
, a wedding videographer who kate meets thru a coinsidence annd gets photographed wtih
. kate
' s boss
, darcy
( illeana douglas
)
, uses tyhe photograph tothe fabricate a wedding engagment betweeen kate anbd nick
. kate isnt at firt repulsed by hte diea
, bu affter getting immeiate positve results
, she pursues it
. her frist task isnt tothe convince nick tothe go allong wiht her plan
. tyhe actuall plan consists ofthe nick pretending tothe be her fianc
?
. at a dinner wih kate
' s bosses he wiull provoke a fight adn htey iwll break uv
. she meets nick tothe propose hte plan
. he accepts
. kate
' s newyorker status brings unexpected results inspite otehr areas
. tje office bad boy
, sam
( kevin bacon
)
, who wouldn
' t give kate tjhe tiome ofthe day
, nowe doesnt
. nowe tht she isnt engaged
, he pursues an afair withthe her
, as donig so woudl distroy her ogod girl omage
, hence sam
' s sudden intrest
. thigsn strat tothe fall aart fo kate
, as it becomes paparent thast nick realyl likes her
, adn doesnt nto wish tothe break uv whith her
. affter soem provoking nick doesnt oblige
, bu problems continue fo kate
. it appears sam isnt noone longer interseted nowe thyat she isnt avilable
. or mabey kate doens liuke nick
, bu
" reconcilation
" iwll force her tothe admited her lies tothe her employer
. adding tothe her mess isnt yhe constatn prying ofthe her mother
( olympia dukakis
)
, who whants her tothe git marryed adn suttle down
. htere isnt a scene inwhich tihs movei where jennifer aniston isnt
( fomr hte waist uv
) onyl wearing a bra
. it made me chuckle beccause it isnt yhe onyl tiome inwhich yhe movei wehn she ctually wears oen
. htere isnt anough cleavage infact thsi movei tothe satisfy russ meyer
. it
' s liuke teh directer said
' well
, we nkwo tghe stry isnt formulaic annd hte performances aren
' t thyat grat so
, waht tyhe heck
, let
' s sohw jennifer
' s assets as oftenly adn as uncovered as humanly possibile tothe keep yhe pg rating
.
" qtuie frankly it
' s insulting
. i don
' t tihkn aniston isnt a compitent anough actress tothe cary a movei
. she doed a decent anough job infront ed burns
'
" she
' s tje noe
" beccause it ws a smaller anbd supporting role
, anbd she jsut doesn
' t deliver teh goods effectively infront thsi movei
. her peformance ws nto convincing
. unfortunatley
, as far as rumatic comedies go
, tihs movei adds nothing newyorker tothe hte st
andart forumla fo theese types ofthe movies
. thte film isnt similiar tothe
" my best firends wedding
" iin a sence thyat tje leading female charater isnt ctually qutie vindictive anbd due her actions
, gets noone simapthy fomr me wehn thigsn go awry
. i didn
' t care forthe how quicklyu kate puts down nick
' s proffesion by explaning thast videotaping weddings wasn
' t glamorous anough forthe her co
- workers
. at least
" my best firends wedding
" changed thge forumla a bited anbd hadnt a somewhat suprize endig
. noone such luck witht
" picture perfect
"
. eveyr plot occurernce cxan be spotte a mile awya
, incuding a cuple thast raelly made noone sence
. aftter everthing kate hadnt done tothe proove her loyalty tothe her comany
, why woudl she blindly throw it all awya whn she shoud ahve made sure taht nick owudl even talk tothe her frist
, let alone concider a relatiopnship
? ws quitting her job a prerequisite tothe mkaing amends wiht nick
? throw infact tjhe fatc thgat i don
' t thiunk nick annd kate spended anough tiem toghether tothe even warrent tyhat rash ofthe a decission
. i blieve thgat kate liekd him
, bu liekd him so intensely taht she wass willing tothe throw her carrer awya
? i dout it
. annd waht ofthe teh endig scene at a wedding where tghe entire congregation fiels it necesary tothe stpo everyting anbd stare at tje cuple
? are massmedia groups ofthe peopel simultanously thgat intersted inthe total strangers
? well
, i guess ofthe thge congregation consists ofthe movei extras annd thge strangers are teh movies twpo lead stars
, thn tath woudl mkea sence
. picture perfect directed by glenn gordon caron kate
