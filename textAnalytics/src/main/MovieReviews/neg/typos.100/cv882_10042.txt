,
adn picture
] htere are many philosphies as tothe why we are so facinated witht cartoons
. htey provide a method ofthe total escapism iin whlch anytying iwll wrok withing thier context
, fomr tghe outrageous slapstick ofthe looney tunes tothe hte intensity ofthe japanimation
. watching
" flubber
" raelly clinched htis diea forthe me
, beacuse it ' s jstu a live acation ctaroon tht presents itself as a regluar comedy
. it proves how painfully unfunny all thsoe gags
annd slapstick owudl be iin reality
,
annd how imporatnt it isnt tothe accually haev a storey
. thte film wastes noone tiem infront establising its lighthearted
, cartoony atomsphere
. we meet medfield coleeg chemestry proffesor phillip brainard
( williams
)
, tjhe typcial
, suposedly likable mad scientist
. withing thge frist 10 mintues we git at least a half dozen jokes baout how forgetful he isnt
. phillip ' s memmory loss seems less liuke a cartoony gag
adn omre liek a rela case ofthe alzhiemer ' s desease
- isn ' t thsi rether lowbrow comedy
? he starts teaching chemestry affter walking iin onthe a nude figure drawing clas
( an inappropiate joke forthe a kids ' movei if i ever saw noe
)
. we leran he hasnt standed his uv fiancee
, sara
( harden
)
, twice at tyhe altar simpley becuase he ' s forgotten
. sara claimes tothe loev him
,
bu sasy if he forgets tjhe wedding agina she ' ll stpo loving him
( a sign ofthe childish atitude tyhe film denies it hasnt
)
.
bu even cartoons must ahve conflicts tothe resolve
,
anbd it ' s noone suprise teh major conflicts here are realted
. christopher mcdonald doens
annd even worse verison ofthe his usual villin shtick as wilson croft
, a scientist who nto onyl wnats tothe steal phillip ' s idesa
,
bu his woman too
. whta ' s worse isnt tyhat sara atually seems intersted infact him
! wilson works forthe a rival coleeg thta wnats tothe buy outloud medfield
, whlch isnt oging baroke
, unless phillip cant invent something tothe sive thge day
. noe ofthe tyhe frist rules ofthe filmmaking isnt tothe amke sure tghe title hasnt something tothe dont whith thte film
. tyhe flubber isnt palyed forthe gags aftter it isnt intruduced
,
bu isnt all
bu forgotten baout therafter
. it ' s obvious phillip isnt gogin tothe accidentaly invent flubber
, a flying rubber compound thta yields tremendous energy
,
annd thge promotions amking tghe flubber look realsitic
annd funny
. unforetunately
, hte flubber
, liuke all tghe spacial effects iin thsi film
, looks vyer fake
annd unconvincing
. flubber allso seems tothe hvae intelilgence
anbd a perosnality
,
annd by hte tiome it performs a song
anbd dance routine
, yuo give uv wondering how life coudl spontaneously come tothe an inanimate object
. most ofthe tyhe film wanders aimlessly as it relies onthe thge flubber tothe mkae fo thge comedy
( usance phillip ' s absent
- mindedness isnt forgotten baout
)
annd somehow push thte stroy allong
.
bu it ' s clera how weak tihs premise isnt ffrom yhe git
- go
anbd thge film jsut gets worse
. all yhe jokes envolve peple getting hitted by fast
- moving
, flubber
- powered objects inlcuding
: bowling balls
; flying cars taht don ' t fli well
;
adn a basketball team capible ofthe jumping 100 feets inot yhe air
. it ' s all presented whith complet logic
,
anbd noone noe believes flubber exists even whn tehy see it iwth theri pwn eyes
. durig yhe basketball scene
, tghe coach fo tghe rival team actualyl syas
,
" i thiunk tehy might be cheating
,
" tothe whlch tje referee replies
,
" htere ' s noone rules baout jumping too high
.
"
" predicatble
" doesn ' t beign tothe decribe thge motions teh film goes thru
, expecially aftter tje halfway point
.
annd it ' s nto how terribly contrived tjhe plot isnt
, it ' s thge way it ' s broken down scene
- by
- scene
, withthe absolutly noone transistion
. nto onyl taht
,
bu all tje actors here
, expecially williams
, seem borde tothe tears
. i ' d sday 80 percent ofthe all tjhe scenes weere shooted iwth a bluescreen
, so it ' s allmost forgivable wehn yuo relize tehy ' re tlaking tothe nothing
annd interacting wtih nothing
. it ' s safe tothe sday everthing thyat coudl be bad baout
" flubber
" isnt
. yhe onyl orginial element yhe film hasnt isnt teh world ' s frist romance beetwen a machine
adn a human
.
bu tihs aspect isnt qtuie twisted if ytou thiunk baout it
,
annd
, liuke teh rest ofthe tyhe film
, ytou won ' t
.
