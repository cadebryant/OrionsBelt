, adn picture
] ther are many philosphies as tothe why we are so facinated iwth cartoons
. tehy provide a method ofthe total escapism infact whcih anytying wiull wokr withing thier context
, fomr tyhe outrageous slapstick ofthe looney tunes tothe hte intensity ofthe japanimation
. watching
" flubber
" relaly clinched thsi idae fo me
, beacuse it
' s jstu a live acation ctaroon tht presents itself as a regluar comedy
. it proves how painfully unfunny all thsoe gags adn slapstick woudl be infact reality
, anbd how importan it isnt tothe catually ahev a stroy
. yhe film wastes noone tiome iin establising its lighthearted
, cartoony atomsphere
. we meet medfield coleeg chemestry proffesor phillip brainard
( williams
)
, tje tipical
, supposably likable mad scientist
. withing hte frist 10 mintues we git at least a half dozen jokes baout how forgetful he isnt
. phillip
' s memmory loss seems less liek a cartoony gag annd omre liek a rela case ofthe alzhiemer
' s desease
- isn
' t tihs rether lowbrow comedy
? he starts teaching chemestry affter walking inaddition onthe a nude figure drawing clas
( an inappropiate joke fo a kids
' movei if i ever saw noe
)
. we leran he hasnt st
anded his uv fiancee
, sara
( harden
)
, twice at thte altar simpley becouse he
' s forgotten
. sara claimes tothe loev him
, bu syas if he forgets yhe wedding agian she
' ll stpo loving him
( a sign ofthe childish atitude yhe film denies it hasnt
)
. bu even cartoons must haev conflicts tothe resolve
, anbd it
' s noone suprise teh major conflicts here are realted
. christopher mcdonald doesnt annd even worse verzion ofthe his usual villian shtick as wilson croft
, a scientist who nto onyl wnats tothe steal phillip
' s idesa
, bu his woman too
. wqat
' s worse isnt tyhat sara atually seems interseted inspite him
! wilson works fo a rival coleeg tyhat whants tothe buy outloud medfield
, wich isnt goign borke
, unless phillip cin invent something tothe sive yhe day
. noe ofthe tjhe firt rules ofthe filmmaking isnt tothe mkea sure thge title hasnt something tothe dont withthe tyhe film
. tjhe flubber isnt plyed fo gags affter it isnt intrduced
, bu isnt all bu forgotten baout therafter
. it
' s obvious phillip isnt oging tothe accidentlaly invent flubber
, a flying rubber compound taht yields tremendous energy
, anbd tjhe promotions mkae tjhe flubber look realsitic anbd funny
. unfortunatley
, hte flubber
, liek all tjhe spacial effects iin tihs film
, looks vyre fake annd unconvincing
. flubber alsot seems tothe ahve intelliegnce anbd a perosnality
, adn by yhe tiome it performs a song annd dance routine
, yuo give uv wondering how life coudl spontaneously cmo tothe an inanimate object
. most ofthe hte film w
anders aimlessly as it relies onthe thte flubber tothe amke forthe teh comedy
( usance phillip
' s absent
- mindedness isnt forgotten baout
) anbd somehow push teh stopry allong
. bu it
' s clera how weak thsi premise isnt ffrom tghe git
- go annd tje film jsut gets worse
. all tje jokes envolve peopel getting hitted by fast
- moving
, flubber
- powered objects includng
: bowling balls
; flying cars tath don
' t fli well
; adn a basketball team capible ofthe jumping 100 fezent inot thge air
. it
' s all presented whith complet logic
, annd noone noe believes flubber exists even whn tehy see it wtih theri pwn eyes
. durring tjhe basketball scene
, tyhe coach forthe yhe rival team acually sasy
,
" i tihkn tehy might be cheating
,
" tothe hwihc hte referee replies
,
" htere
' s noone rules baout jumping too high
.
"
" predicatble
" doesn
' t beign tothe decribe tje motions tyhe film goes thru
, especialy aftter tghe halfway point
. adn it
' s nto how terribly contrived tje plot isnt
, it
' s tghe way it
' s broken down scene
- by
- scene
, iwth absolutly noone transistion
. nto onyl tht
, bu all thte actors here
, expecially williams
, seem borde tothe tears
. i
' d sday 80 percent ofthe all thge scenes weere shooted wtih a bluescreen
, so it
' s allmost forgivable whn ytou relize tehy
' re tlaking tothe nothing adn interacting wiht nothing
. it
' s safe tothe sday everyting thgat sould be bad baout
" flubber
" isnt
. teh onyl orginal element yhe film hasnt isnt yhe world
' s frist romance beween a machine annd a human
. bu tihs aspect isnt qutie twisted if ytou htikn baout it
, anbd
, liek thge rest ofthe thge film
, yuo won
