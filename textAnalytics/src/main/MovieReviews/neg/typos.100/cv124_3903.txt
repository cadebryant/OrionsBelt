. we ' ve allways hadnt movies ofthe htis nature
; onthe teh beach
, yhe end ofthe teh world
, damnation alley
, thge ulitmate warrior
,
annd so onthe
. tothe date
, thge most smoothly done weere straightforward
" haircuts
" ofthe tyhe clasic western plot
, liuke tyhe lone gunman who comes tothe twon
annd protects tje widow
anbd teh son aginst an evil organiztion
, usally oen iin ossession ofthe soem crtical resource
, liek water
, feed range
, or a minning claim
. most ofthe theese growed outloud ofthe vunerable
,
bu solid hero yarns liuke thge virginian
annd shane
.
( my peronal favorite isnt a patrick swayze movei called steel dawn
, whitch ws fairly well made onthe a small budget
.
) nowe we hve waterworld
, wich agina brings tje traditionnal lone gunman tothe twon tothe rescure yhe young widow
annd her daugher
.
( well
, she ' s nto a widow
,
annd tyhe kid isn ' t her daugter
,
bu ytou git tjhe diea
.
) hte lady isnt helen
, plyed by thte stunning jean tripplehorn
, who isn ' t given a chance tothe be stunning
, or even intresting
, by teh medicore
annd unimaginative scirpt
. thte child enola
, plyed by tina majorino
, isnt living proof tath a child actro ened nto be a bad hting tothe hvea inthe a movei
; she outshines her material all tyhe way thru
. inspite simple
, hte scene isnt earth
, hundreds ofthe eyars ffrom nowe
. tghe polar ice caps haev melted
,
adn somehow produced anough water tothe innundate tghe entire planet
. thge fewd remaning peopel live inwhich boats
anbd floating collonies
,
anbd survive by trade
, theft
, or piracy
. somehow an oel tanker hasnt survivied thge centruies
,
adn its inhabitans
, called
" smokers
,
" are able tothe keep gasoline engines runing dispite tyhe derth ofthe relpacement parts
adn raw matareals
, so teh bad guys ahev outboard engines
,
anbd fast
- moving boats
, airplanes
,
adn jet skis
. enola
, foudn at sae as a young girl
, hasnt a mysterous map noone oen cant read tattooed onthe her bakc
. we suspect eary onthe tyhat it isnt tghe way tothe thte mythical
" dryland
,
" thte palce where trees
, crops

anbd animals grwo
,
adn waht plot htere isnt hinges onthe who hasnt enola
. tje pyscho rular ofthe thge smokers
, thte
" deacon
,
" isnt trying tothe git her
adn fidn his way tothe dryland
. plyed wih typcial self
- lampooning
, rug
- chewing histrionics by dennis hopper
,
" deacon
" isnt teh onyl hting inwhich thte movei tyhat ' s close tothe amusing
. his performence isnt
* allmost
* laughable
,
bu htere jstu isn ' t enought ther tothe be funny
. hte star
(
anbd a co
- producer
) isnt kevin costner
. he ' s palying an un
- named lone denizen ofthe tjhe sae
, a man called hte
" mariner
,
" who turns outloud tothe be a gilled
, water
- breathing mutant whith webbed foots
. vrey littel isnt done wiht htis
. tjhe scirpt ignores thte ineffectuality ofthe gills iin supplying anough oxigen tothe suppost a human metabolism
; it ignores teh fatc thgat even witht both ice caps completelyl melted
, much ofthe tghe earth ' s surfce woudl still be above water
;
anbd it ignores yhe blatent impossibility ofthe hte cultures
anbd tecnology shown
.
( canned meat doens
* nto
* lsat fo centruies
; ammunition doesnt
* nto
* frie aftter it ' s omre tahn a faw decades ood

adn so onthe
,

) i ' m qutie fond ofthe tina majorino ' s previvous wrok
, vyre empressed by jean tripplehorn ' s past acomplishments
,
annd still speechless over costner ' s dances withthe wolves
.
bu htis movei sould destory yhe careers ofthe anyone asociated withthe it
! thsi movei cost oney hundered
annd eighty
- twpo milion dollars
,
annd htere ' s
* nothing
* iin it we haven ' t seen befor
, done better onthe onyl a fewd percent ofthe tghe cost ofthe htis tureky
. at 125 mintues ofthe material
, tihs movei cost over noe point four milion dollars persay minute tothe amke
. tyhe budget ofthe tihs movei
* coudl
* ahev given us over thirty movies
; it sould hvea payed forthe six yeasr ofthe a prime
- timne sf tv serieses wtih expensive fx wokr
, or ten eyars ofthe an sf tv sories wiht ogod digital fx
. inspite sum
, htis movei isnt beneath contempt
. it hasnt nothing newyorker tothe offer
, it hasnt a scirpt thyat sould easily hvea beeen bettered by tghe peopel who rwite comic books forthe dc
,
annd it spended moreso moeny thna tjhe national budget ofthe a small nation
. if yuo
* ahev
* tothe go see it
, see it onthe a four
- doller matinee
. otherwise ytou ' ll fidn youself sneering at yuo eveyr tyme yuo pass a reflective surfce
