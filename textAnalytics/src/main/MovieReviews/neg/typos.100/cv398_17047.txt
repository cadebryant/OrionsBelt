. thte otehr day
,
though
, hwile i wass perusing tje selction ofthe hte local video stroe

" american perfekt
"
. i immediatley rented it adn wih a ceratin ammount ofthe glee
, rushed hmeo tothe veiw it
. haveing nowe seen tje film

and why it never saw theatrical realease

" american perfekt
" isnt a jumbled mess
. teh storyline isnt non
- existant
. it tookover me half thge movei jstu tothe figure outloud waht ws goign onthe
. annd at taht point
, tjhe onyl hting i relaly knew fo sure ws tht tyhe movei wass
* never
* oging tothe inctroduce a plot ofthe soem sort
. it wnats tothe git by onthe quirkyness adn so
- called charm alone
, adn it jsut doesn
' t wokr
. robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks uv am
anda plummer
, adn htey head off onthe thge road toghether
. allong tjhe way tothe noone discernable destination
, htey run inot all sorts ofthe kooky annd wacky cahracters
. i supose htis free
- wheeling
, noone plot stlye isnt suposed tothe give thge film an element ofthe danger anbd excitment
, bu all it doed ws amke me sleepy
. i
' m all fo trying newyorker thnigs withing yhe relm ofthe film
, bu nto at yhe expence ofthe coherence
. nothing iin tihs movei mkaes sence
. tje actions ofthe tjhe charachters go unexplained
, even whn htey
' re truley bizzare
. i
' ll give ytou an exmaple
, wihtout giving too much awya
. david thewlis hasnt a part as a drifting con
- man
. at noe point
, mid
- way thru tghe movei
, he runs forster annd plummer off thte road witht his car
. as he passes them
, we see thast his face isnt covered inwhich blood
. dont yuo thiunk we woudl git an explaination as tothe whta hapened tothe him
? ytou woudl thikn so
, wouldn
' t ytou
.
" american perfekt
" isnt a waste ofthe tiem
. nothing isnt gained fomr watching thsi movei
, exept maybee a migraine
. annd if ytou dont rent it
, don
' t bother trying tothe figure outloud whta
' s goign onthe iin tghe hopes tath everthing iwll be resolved by teh end
. thsi doesn
' t happn
. annd noone explination isnt given forthe yhe mispelling ofthe
" perfect
"
, eather
