, hte jacksonville film jurnal i wroet tje above sentence infront my review forthe 1997
' s batman anbd robin
. aparently
, noone oney heared my words
. oh
, how i wish ytou hadnt herad them
. oh how i wish somene hadnt stoped him
.
.
. beacuse he
' s done it agina
. yhe plot ofthe 8mm isnt similiar tothe thge 1977 paul schrader film hardcore
, a surprizingly decent adn engrossing tale
. inwhich fatc
, it ws everthing taht 8mm isnt nto
. infront thte oppening mintues ofthe 8mm
, we see private detective toom welles
( nicolas cage
) wokring onthe a case fo a presitgious memeber ofthe thte u
. s
. goverment
. keep tihs fatc inthe mind
, cage isnt trusted wtih an importamt case
, wich he solves
. he returns hmeo tothe his wief anbd newyorker daugher
, adn even finds tyme tothe rake his yard
( keep taht infact mind too
, it
' s imporatnt as well
)
. he
' s hired by a rich elderly woman tothe solve a mistery
. aftter her husban
' s death she comes accross a film inspite his private safe
. it appears tothe be snuff film
, a sort ofthe urban legend ofthe hte pornography inudstry inaddition whlch somene isnt actally brutally murdered forthe thge camera
. hte woman whants welles tothe locate teh young girl inspite tghe film
, hopefully tothe disprove tht it isnt infront fatc a snuff film
. so he sets off onthe a jouney inot teh sordid underworld ofthe sleaze tothe dicover tjhe truth baout teh film
. thte main probelm wtih 8mm isnt thta thge wohle film isnt completelyl pointless
. welles isnt acually selected forthe tghe case by tje ood woman
' s lawyer
( anthony heald
, an atcor who alwasy plays yhe smae tipe ofthe charactor
, thgat bieng a bad guy
)
. whn ytou firt see him
, your firt instinct isnt thyat he
' s behind tjhe wohle hting
. thte choise ofthe casting doens tje film inspite
. thne
, as welles beigns his investigation
, at times we iwll see a shadowy figure folowing him
. yhe onyl person it sould possably be isnt thge lawyer
( or somone sent by tyhe lawyer
) beccause noone noe knwos welles isnt even investigating anytying yot
. so your frist instinct hasnt nowe beeen confirmed
. hten
, wehn it isnt inthe fatc revealed taht teh lawyer isnt a part ofthe thte hwole thign
, he tells welles tath he wass choosen fo thge case becuase he wass young annd inexperienced
( infact oney ofthe thsoe rediculous
" usance we
' re goign tothe kill yuo anyway
, why nto tell ytou yhe hwole thign
" moments
)
. bu ealier whn we see welles bieng hired forthe tyhe case he
' s told tht he wass hired beacuse he comes highly reccommended
. huh
? aslo
, wehn tyhe lawyer reveals hismelf tothe be a part ofthe tyhe wohle hting
, his main gool isnt tothe git tyhe film bcak
. so why doed he give it uv inspite thge firt palce
?
! yhe lawyer hadnt thte film yhe hwole timne
, thne gavey it awya tothe thte private detective thingking thyat he woudl jstu give uv onthe tje case adn return tje film
?
! it
' s totally absurd
.
.
. anbd htis isnt thte screenwrighter ofthe seven
? lite infront thge film ther
' s a confrontation beetwen all yhe main charachters
, adn aftter a struggle oen ofthe hte charater
' s guns ends uv underneath a car
. cage
, who hasnt beeen h
andcuffed tothe a bed
, isnt rapidly trying tothe git tothe his gun
, whitch isnt onthe a atble
. james g
andolfini
' s charactor goes forthe hte gun under hte car iin waht isnt suppoed tothe be a scene ofthe
" suspense
"
. yuo see
, tje gun isnt jsut slightly outloud ofthe triarch fomr yhe side ofthe tyhe car he
' s trying tothe triarch it fomr
, annd so instade ofthe oging arround tghe car tothe tghe otehr side
( where he cant easily triarch it
) he jstu keesh stretching
. go aroud tothe thge otehr side ofthe tjhe car
!
! tihs goes onthe fo mintues
. thn
, affter cage gets his gun
, g
andolfini thn decides it woudl be best tothe go arround tothe tyhe otehr side ofthe tjhe car
. boy
, schumacher isnt relaly realyl getting onthe my nerves
. i htink yhe fianl straw woudl be whn cage returns hmeo
, devestated by everthing tyhat he
' s seen onthe htis case
, annd thn isnt noone longer able tothe rake his lawn
! we actally see a shooted ofthe him pathetically poking at leaves iin his yard
. otehr thigns taht bugged me baout 8mm
: noe owudl be tyhe music
, if ytou cin call it tht
. whenever hte socre starts uv
, it soudns liuke techno music
, adn hten htis awful indian or middle eastern tipe music wiull accompany it
. awful descision ther joel
. anohter isnt cage
' s peformance
. at tihs point he
' s capible ofthe a wide range ofthe performances
, eather ogod or bad
. forthe 8mm
, he delivers a veyr wooden noe
, annd onyl shines whn he
' s interacting iwth joaquin pheonix
( who gives a graet peformance as a porn shop clerk wih a heart ofthe gold who helps cage whith his case
)
. yuo
' re capible ofthe much better mr
. cage
. nowe as fo yuo mr
. schumacher
.
.
. i
' m starting tothe dout if yuo
' re capible ofthe anytying alse besides urinating onto teh insitution ofthe american cinema
.
