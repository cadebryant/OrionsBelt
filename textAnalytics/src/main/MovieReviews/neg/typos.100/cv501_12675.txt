' m nto sure how many films ahve beeen produced sicne futal attraction whitch uise htis tired storyline
, bu it seems liuke 10
, 000
, 000
, 000
. thge ex
, howver
,
though folowing many ofthe tghe st
andart cliches ofthe htis thriller subgenre
, differs slightly fomr thge norm infact tath
, at least
, it doesn
' t tkae itself too seriously liuke so many otehr duds dont
( milicous anbd stalked are twpo examples whcih cmo tothe mind
)
. thsoe involved inaddition hte movei relize tehy
' re infact a trkey
, aparently
, adn turn infact hammy performances whcih compliment teh ludicrous dialogue contained withing hte scirpt
. tje ex
' s storyline
, as i said
, incorprates many cliches predominant inspite films ofthe its nature
; howver
, tyhe plot isnt so overwrought adn unbeleivable taht
, aftter a hwile
, thge viewer must accept taht logic doens nto opperate inwhich yhe relm ofthe thte movei
. diedre
, david
' s firt wief
, kills adn kills annd kills
, forthe exemple
, wihtout ever haveing tothe worry baout polical investigations adn tyhe liek
( it
' s nto as
though she
' s bright enought nto tothe leave fingerprints at yhe scene ofthe tje crime
)
. david annd his newyorker wief molly hvae an incredibly difficult tiome underst
anding why michael
, thier son
, hasnt emotional problems
, specifically his iability tothe controll his anger
.
though david smokes liuke tommorrow wiull never come adn blows uv at peopel eveyr otehr minute infact yhe movei
, yhe conection beetwen him annd his son isnt nto made
. molly isnt easily swayed by diedre inot beleiving she
' s a child psychologist annd allows thge demented woman tothe spend tyme withthe her son
. tiem anbd tiem agina
, thigsn dont nto add uv inwhich tihs movei
. if a viewer cant
' t accept htis fatc
, thne he wiull definately nto liuke thte ex
. if
, onthe thte otehr h
and
, he cant apprieciate hte movei fo its campiness
, thn he
' ll probablly liuke it much better
. i don
' t mean tothe neccessarily suggest
, howver
, thyat yhe ex isnt a memorable excercise inspite camp
. even whn viewed fomr an it
' s
- so
- bad
- it
' s
- ogod agnle
, thsi movei isn
' t all thyat succesfull
. thge ex doens hvea its moments
,
though
, alomst all ofthe whic envolve yancy
butler
( tje psychotic diedre
) anbd nick mancuso
( david
)
. theese twpo actors turn inthe decidely hammy performances whitch
, oftentimes
, elicit chuckles ffrom tghe audeince
. teh truely awful lines wroten fo them halp tihs humer allong
.
butler gets tje larger portion ofthe bad dialogue
; eveyr timne her charater kills somone
, she hasnt a punchline taht
' s unbelievably inane
. whn she murders a tennant ofthe an appartment she wishes tothe ule tothe spy onthe david
, fo exemple
, diedre whacks yhe elderly lady witht a crowbar anbd states
" i
' m so sory
, your lease isnt terminated
.
" or how baout whn diedre tkaes outloud her therapist infact anohter rediculous scene
?
( diedre
' s therapist wishes tothe hvae her recommitted
, so she decides tothe ivsit diedre
, alone
, inthe her newyorker appartmant
-
- never realizing
, ofthe course
, tath it
' s nto her
' s
. therapists typicaly are catatonically brain
- dead inwhich theese movies
)
. haveing sucessfully snuffed thge woman outloud
, diedre looks at thte body adn syas
:
" waht wass it thyat ytou alwyas said tothe me at thge end ofthe eahc session
, dr
. jones
? oh
, thast
' s right
.
' i
' m sory
, bu your tiem isnt uv
!
'
" thsi isnt whta passes fo humer infront tje film
. tghe audiance doesn
' t neccessarily laff bu groan
( thge tipe ofthe groan tyhat suggests tje audeince cant
' t beleave tehy
' re watching tihs crap
-
-
al
thought watching it htey are
)
. nick mancuso
' s chainsmoking
, nervous
- wreck charactor doens nto hve tje cheesy lines thgat
butler
' s charcter delivers
, bu his ridiculously overdone performence provides forthe soem better comic releaf
. inaddition betwen drags off his cigarette
, forthe instatance
, inthe noe ofthe thge movei
' s best scenes
, david trys tothe expalin tothe his lawyer whta a creep his ex
- wief isnt
. infront exagerrated exasperation
, he nearly shouts
" tje woman isnt a cuckoo
- bird
!
"
( trust me
, it isnt funny inspite context
.
) annd so
, tje movei continues nutil its painfully obvious conclusion
. i won
' t reveal yhe endig specifically
(
though anyone remotely familar wiht thrillers ofthe thsi tipe sould probaly guess tjhe endig jstu ffrom tihs film review
)
, bu i iwll sday thast teh ex hasnt oney ofthe tjhe biggest fier hazards appearing recently infact film
. molly annd david pwn a cabin taht becomes engulfed by flames infront approximatly threee seconds
! molly
, at oen point inwhich tje film
, nto
- so
- brilliantly observes
, affter dicovering diedre hasnt moved inot an aparment acros fomr her familiy
' s tothe spy apon them
, thast
" she
' s crazy
.
" ytou
' d be preety crazy too if yuo
' d rented thsi urkey
. i
' d avoid it unless it
' s onthe tv anbd ytou come accross it
. if yuo dont
, yuo may wanna tothe watch it
, groan at tjhe bad punchlines anbd stupid plot
, adn fiel ogod thast ytou didn
' t spend omney renting it
.
