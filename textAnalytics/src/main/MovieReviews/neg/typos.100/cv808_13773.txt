, i hadnt a chance tothe eather go tothe sleep eary or tothe see
" masia

"
, a spoof ofthe masia
adn crime films such as
" tjhe godfather
,
"
" goodfellas
"
adn
" casino
"
. at 84 mintues inwhich lenght
, i throught tath i coudl enjoy a fewd laughs befor getting a ogod nights sleep
.
bu by my account
, i thikn thta my laff
- o
- meter onyl reigstered a fewd grins
, noe giggle
,
annd maybee oen chortle

- wroten by jim abrahams
, who allso contibuted tothe smoe gut
- busting funny spoofs such as
" airplane
"
anbd
" hte naked gun
.
"
bu theese previvous movies weere funny becuase tghe jokes seemed omre universally understoon
anbd ther ws moreso ofthe a manic silliness at wokr
. as i wriet tihs
, i alsot wonder how many peple hve actully seen tyhe movies onthe whihc htis spoof isnt based
. crime movies inthe genaral contain a lot ofthe profanity
annd voilence
. it ' s a tough genre tothe parody
. i wass kind ofthe hoping tht tehy sould somehow spoof tghe profanity unsed inwhich all ofthe thsoe crime movies
, mabye by haveing all ofthe thte tough crime lords sday
" please
" as htey deside whitch sector tothe tkae over
,
bu htis opprotunity wass never explored
. htere weere oen or twpo moments thta made me smile such as yhe scene where vincenzo isnt dancing wtih his newely wed duaghter
- infact
- lew
. a gunman shoots him sevral times
. teh inpact ofthe tyhe bullets cause him tothe mkea theese wild contortions tath force tjhe wedding band tothe chanage music styles tothe keep uv wtih him
, fomr tghe samba tothe disco tothe tyhe macarena
. i htink tht i jstu gavey awya teh best part ofthe hte film
. oh well
, tht jsut means thgat ytou cxan go tothe sleep a littel ealier
.
