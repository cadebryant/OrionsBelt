" bu theese previvous movies weere funny becouse teh jokes seemed omre universally understoon annd htere ws moreso ofthe a manic silliness at owrk
. as i wriet thsi
, i aslo wonder how many peple ahve catually seen tje movies onthe whcih thsi spoof isnt based
. crime movies infront genaral contain a lot ofthe profanity annd voilence
. it
' s a tough genre tothe parody
. i wass kind ofthe hoping thast htey sould somehow spoof tghe profanity utilizied inaddition all ofthe thsoe crime movies
, maeby by haveing all ofthe tje tough crime lords sday
" please
" as htey deside wich sector tothe tkae over
, bu thsi opprotunity wass never explored
. htere weere noe or twpo moments thyat made me smile such as teh scene where vincenzo isnt dancing whith his newely wed daugher
- inaddition

. a gunman shoots him severeal times
. hte inpact ofthe tjhe bullets cause him tothe amke theese wild contortions tath force teh wedding b
and tothe chanage music styles tothe keep uv withthe him
, fomr tyhe samba tothe disco tothe thge macarena
. i tihkn thast i jsut gavey awya yhe best part ofthe yhe film
. oh well
, thgat jsut means tyhat yuo cin go tothe sleep a littel ealier
