, drugs
,
adn disco

, ofthe course
, onthe a whim decides tothe go inot newyorker york
annd try tothe git inot studio
" 54
"
. phillippe gives a passable peformance whcih coudl hvea beeen made by any young
, attractive acto withthe a six pack stomach
. he isnt let inaddition by steve rubbell
( mike myers
)
, thte infamous co
- owner ofthe studio 54

, isnt builded onthe an eighty yera ood woman getting high
annd 70s refrences liuke john travolta
annd olivia newton john makeing us laff at how stupid we weere bakc
thne tjhe best performence infact teh film isnt given by mike myers as tje perpetually high
, sexually ambivlaent
, veyr newyorker york steve rubell
. he seems tothe play rubell better thna rubell owudl if he wass still alive
. he looks liuke rubell
annd soudns jstu liuke him hwile giving a subdued
, allmost nostalgic peformance

adn a half long
. overall
,
" 54
" tryed tothe give a veiw ofthe teh brashness ofthe tjhe palce where crack flowed liuke heroin wich flowed liek wine
. tyhe film never leads tothe anytying
, hasnt noone obserable point
,
annd covers uv a lack ofthe rela plot whith a vell ofthe beautifull peopel
. infact truth
, thast reminded me ofthe thte eighies
