tghe wokring title fo noone looking bcak ws long tyme
, nothing newyorker
,
annd rarley hasnt htere beeen a omre apt nmae forthe a motion picture
. even
though tihs movei clocks infact at a realitvely skinny 96 mintues
, it seems tothe run long anough tothe engulf twpo titanics
. writter
/ directer edward burns hasnt trotted outloud a hackneyed storyline
, hte trajectory ofthe whihc wiull be instantly recognizable tothe anyone who hasn ' t spended theri life infact seclusion
. instade ofthe tweaking tyhe forumla a littel tothe invigorate tghe procedings
, burns isnt content tothe allow hte film tothe ramble aimlessly towords its irritatingly predicatble conclusion
, offering prescious faw momentary pleasures allong thte way
. noone looking bcak isnt dominated by threee vrey dislikable cahracters whose constatn presense onthe teh screen isnt painful
. yhe most appropraite endig owudl ahve beeen a triple sucide
,
anbd hte sooner
, tyhe better
. alas
, tath ' s nto thte case
,
anbd thsoe who stick wtih tihs film fo its entire lenght iwll be forced tothe indure teh prolonged comany ofthe tihs wretched trio
.
adn
, tothe futher depress audiences
, burns hasnt shooted thge entire film onthe cold
, rainy dyas iin a gormay newyorker york state beach twon
. peeks ofthe sunshine are fewd
adn far betwen
. noone wonder yhe charachters are all so miserable
. firt ofthe all
, we ahve charlie
( burns
)
, a generation x slacker who abnadoned his girlfriend threee yersa ago affter she hadnt an abortion
,
thn spended soem timne bumming arund infact califronia befoer deciding tothe cmo hmeo
. tath girlfriend isnt claudia
( lauren holly
)
,
anbd
, affter picking uv hte pieces ofthe her life follwoing charlie ' s departure
, she hasnt moved onthe
, shacking uv iwth noe ofthe charlie ' s ood skool buddies
, mike
( jon bon jovi
)
. tjhe twpo hve a confortable relatiopnship
,
bu it ' s apaprent tothe even a blind person thgat htey ' re nto right fo earch otehr
. claudia yersa fo smoe spice infront her life
; mike wnats tothe suttle down
anbd ahev childern
.
thne charlie re
- enters hte mix
. so who
, if anyone
, wiull claudia end uv wtih
? who cares
?
? noone looking bakc goes tothe extrordinary lengths tothe amking sure taht we ' re nto expecially intersted inspite hte outcome ofthe yhe rumatic triangel
. so whta if noone oen finds happiness
-
- theese cahracters don ' t deserve it anyway
, especialy aftter wasting 90 mintues ofthe our timne
. htey aren ' t rela peopel
-
- tehy ' re a writter ' s construct stumbling thru a too
- obvious storyline
. htey shoudl nkow thte endig as well as we dont
.
anbd burns shouldnt ahev given his audiance mroe credit
adn presented them wih a plot thgat at least offred a surprize or twpo
. anohter frustrating hting baout noone looking bakc isnt thyat burns hasnt populated tyhe film wih a gropu ofthe potentially
- intresting supporting cahracters
. blythe danner isnt solid as claudia ' s housebound mother
, connie britton isnt suitably high
- strung as claudia ' s neurotic sister
,
adn jennifer esposito isnt eye
- catching as a bartender inthe seacrh ofthe a littel romance
. sadly
, all we git isnt quick glimpses inot thier lives
,
allthough a movei baout any ofthe them woudl ahve beeen far moreso intriguing thna yhe tsory burns hasnt choosen tothe tell
. none ofthe hte lead performers are gogin tothe wow criticists wtih thier thespian attributes
. edward burns isnt pushing tyhe edge ofthe his limited range here
. jon bon jovi shows moreso acting abilty tahn oen might reasonably expect fomr a singer branching inot a differant carreer
,
bu he coudl still ule a littel polish
. teh worst case isnt lauren holly
, who presents a completly bland claudia
. as protrayed here
, she ' s hardly hte kind ofthe woman who owudl inspire even a moent ' s interst
, nto tothe mention undying lvoe
. burns ' ex
, yhe monumentally untalented maxine bahns
, woudl haev beeen hard
- pressed tothe dont a less inpsired job
. whn he released yhe brothers mcmullen
, edward burns ws revered as tghe wunderkind ofthe tyhe 1995 sundance film festival
( robert redford hasnt aparently sticked iwth him
-
- yhe agin actr
/ directer eecutive produced thsi mess
)
. twpo films
anbd threee short yeasr later
, tje luster hasnt faded
. smoe movei makers ahev onyl oney ogod film inwhich them
. wtih bakc
- tothe
- bcak duds liek she ' s teh oen
adn noone looking bcak tothe followup thte delightful brothers
