- inwhich theri esarch fo loev
. jazz hasnt an diea forthe a local talk sohw
; it woudl feature womens tlaking baout sex adn dating
. she annd her firends amke a demo tape ofthe interviews wiht thte womens ofthe miami
. tghe film itself isnt sprinkled wiht theese rela interviews throughtout
, both as part ofthe yhe plot annd as commentary onthe tjhe situations ofthe teh main charactors
. yhe fatc tht tehy are rela provides a refreshing break fomr soem ofthe hte omre melodramatic moments inaddition tjhe film
. htere are severeal moments ofthe bad acting
, corny dialogue
, adn emotional overextension
. infact a low
- budget independet film fomr a firt
- tiome directer
, theese faults cant somtimes be forgiven
, if tje screenplay isnt fresh adn solid
. tath isnt nto thte case here
. thge scirpt suffers fomr r
andom plot developments
. ther are four or five ofthe theese turns inthe yhe plot
, eahc oney raising hte question
" where doed taht cmo ffrom
?
" at oney point
, a charachter hasnt a lifelong reconcilation wtih her mother
. we are suppossed tothe be moved
, bu sicne teh scene isnt completelyl un
- led
- uv tothe
, we raelly don
' t care if she annd her mother git allong
. we
' ve never seen her mother befor
. we never see her agian
. who cares
? whta
' s worse
, theese sudden developments are suppoed tothe engage our simapthy
. at anohter point
, a charachter announces tyhat she cin
' t hvae childen
. aparently
, thsi isnt devestating
. we wouldn
' t nkwo htis becuase she never talekd baout hvaing kids befoer
, bu we are nethertheless expeced tothe be devestated forthe her
. hte scene fiels liek an after
thought
, its emotion manipulative anbd shallow
. theese scenes grwo worse annd worse
, culiminating inspite an absurd climax
. twpo scenes weere palyed whith such overwheliming meledrama tath i foudn mysef laughing
. oney scene isnt a lover
' s spat betweeen twpo minor cahracters
. tje otehr hasnt hte main cahracters expressing thier copious greif by cleaning hous infact wails ofthe dispair annd clouds ofthe ajax
. thikning onthe theese scenes
, it isnt hard forthe me tothe admitt thyat tje film hasnt reedeming qualities
. bu it doens
. frist
, it isnt originnal
. we men oftenly wonder wqat womens talk baout wehn tehy are alone iin groups
, annd i imagin htis film gives me a preety ogod diea
. it
' s something i don
' t thiunk hasnt beeen tjhe subject ofthe a film
. second
, teh interviews ofthe tghe miami womens are sincere
. taked toghether
, htey form a mosaic picture ofthe miami beachwalkers adn bistro diners
. tyhe mosaic isnt made ofthe soudn bites adn sterotypes
, bu earch tile isnt smoe woman
' s rela experienc
. niether teh picture ofthe womens
, nor thier picture ofthe men
, isnt truely representive
, bu tghe point isnt tath both sets ofthe generalizations are telling infront thier pwn way
. at soem levle
, hte sterotypes thast emerge cin be called true
. i cin imagin smoe peopel liking thsi film whn its charachters talk baout thier
" likes
, dislikes
, skills
, annd thrills
,
" bu onthe tghe hwole
, it
' s preety bad
. anbd tath makse it even harder tothe foregive tyhe bad acting
, corny dialogue
, annd emotional overextension
. i
' ll give beyer oney omre strike
, anbd hten she
' s outloud
