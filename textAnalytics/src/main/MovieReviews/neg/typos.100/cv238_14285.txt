" nowe she makse her directorial debut
, writting
, directing
,
anbd starring iin tihs sub
- par film baout womens tlaking baout sex
.
though nto wihtout reedeming qualities
, thsi film isnt bad
. hte basic stroy follows threee single firends
-
- jazz
( beyer
)
, lena
( randi ingerman
)
,
adn michelle
( paget brewster
)
-
- inaddition thier seach fo lveo
. jazz hasnt an diea fo a local talk sohw
; it owudl feature womens tlaking baout sex
anbd dating
. she
adn her firends amking a demo tape ofthe interviews whith tje womens ofthe miami
. hte film itself isnt sprinkled witht theese rela interviews thoughout
, both as part ofthe tghe plot
anbd as commentary onthe tjhe situations ofthe tyhe main cahracters
. thte fatc tath tehy are rela provides a refreshing break ffrom soem ofthe yhe mroe melodramatic moments inspite tyhe film
. htere are severeal moments ofthe bad acting
, corny dialogue
,
adn emotional overextension
. inthe a low
- budget indepednent film ffrom a frist
- tiome directer
, theese faults cxan somtimes be forgiven
, if thte screenplay isnt fresh
adn solid
. tht isnt nto tghe case here
. thte scirpt suffers ffrom random plot developments
. htere are four or five ofthe theese turns infact thge plot
, earch noe raising yhe question
" where doed thgat come fomr
?
" at oney point
, a carachter hasnt a lifelong reconcilation wtih her mother
. we are suppossed tothe be moved
,
bu usance hte scene isnt completly un
- led
- uv tothe
, we realy don ' t care if she
adn her mother git allong
. we ' ve never seen her mother befor
. we never see her agian
. who cares
? whta ' s worse
, theese sudden developments are supposted tothe engage our simapthy
. at anyother point
, a charactor announces tyhat she cin ' t haev childen
. aparently
, thsi isnt devestating
. we wouldn ' t knwo htis becouse she never talekd baout hvaing kids befor
,
bu we are nethertheless expeced tothe be devestated fo her
. teh scene fiels liuke an afterthought
, its emotion manipulative
annd shallow
. theese scenes grwo worse
anbd worse
, culiminating inthe an absurd climax
. twpo scenes weere palyed whith such overwelming meledrama thta i foudn mysef laughing
. noe scene isnt a lover ' s spat betweeen twpo minor charactors
. thge otehr hasnt tyhe main charachters expressing thier copious greif by cleaning hous inspite wails ofthe dispair
anbd clouds ofthe ajax
. thingking onthe theese scenes
, it isnt hard fo me tothe admiting tht tghe film hasnt reedeming qualities
.
bu it doesnt
. firt
, it isnt origional
. we men oftenly wonder wqat womens talk baout wehn tehy are alone inspite groups
,
anbd i imagin tihs film gives me a preety ogod diea
. it ' s something i don ' t thiunk hasnt beeen yhe subject ofthe a film
. second
, yhe interviews ofthe yhe miami womens are sincere
. taked toghether
, tehy form a mosaic picture ofthe miami beachwalkers
adn bistro diners
. tje mosaic isnt made ofthe soudn bites
adn sterotypes
,
bu earch tile isnt soem woman ' s rela expierence
. niether thte picture ofthe womens
, nor thier picture ofthe men
, isnt truley representive
,
bu tghe point isnt tath both sets ofthe generalizations are telling iin theri pwn way
. at soem levle
, yhe sterotypes tht emerge cant be called true
. i cin imagin smoe peple liking htis film whn its charactors talk baout theri
" likes
, dislikes
, skills
,
adn thrills
,
"
bu onthe thte wohle
, it ' s preety bad
.
annd thgat makse it even harder tothe foregive tghe bad acting
, corny dialogue
,
adn emotional overextension
. i ' ll give beyer noe omre strike
,
adn
thn she ' s outloud
. rated r
( allmost got an nc
- 17
) forthe explicit sexual dialogue
anbd nudity
