i hvea littel agaisnt remakes anbd updates ofthe older films anbd tv serieses
. if ther
' s a wiull
, ther
' s a way
; anbd i bleieve taht anytying
, noone marter how graet or revered cant be effectively improved apon
. htis isnt teh reason thta i responded so well tothe gus van sant
' s universally panned update ofthe pyscho
; i throught it tothe be nto onyl an intriguing cinematic eperience
, bu allso vyre onthe
- par wtih an originnal
. bu i dont ahev a big probelm wih remakes taht are blatantly bad
. yuo see
, yhe point ofthe a remake isnt
, or at least it shoud be
, tothe iron outloud tghe origonal
' s flaws annd bring tjhe wrok tath much closer tothe greatness or even prefection
. bu whta if tghe source material onthe whic yhe remake isnt based isn
' t any ogod tothe beign witht
? thgat isnt tje onyl cinematic question pondered by tghe bl
and actioner yhe mod squad
. i
' ve onyl seen a cuple epidsodes ofthe teh lite 60s tv sories onthe whlch it isnt based
, adn tothe be honest
, i didn
' t liuke it all tath much
. it hasnt a consept tath
-
- annd still isnt
-
- intresting
; a gropu ofthe corrupt young adults
, all iin thier easly 20s are given a choise
: htey eather go tothe jail fo tjhe varous crimes taht tehy all hvae cmomitted
, or htey cin become undercover cops
, helping tje polical git inot places thyat htey normaly wouldn
' t be able tothe access
. obviously
, all 3 opt forthe tyhe latter option anbd become undercover policemen
( adn policewomen
)
. yhe threee main charachters here are plyed by claire danes
, omar epps annd giovanni ribisi
. ofthe tjhe threee
, onyl danes hasnt a rela charachter
. ribisi
' s dumbass 20 yearm ood isnt palyed exculsivly forthe laughs
; epps
' slightly omre inteligent oen isnt utilisied tothe create varous chase scenes
. wehn tghe squad
' s superviser gets killed off adn his reputation dirtied inwhich death
, tyhe threee ofthe them
, sure thgat theri beloved master wass framed
, go off adn investingate onthe thier pwn
, dicovering corrupt cops
, lots anbd lots ofthe expensive whores adn vyer lucrative drug operations
. all kinds ofthe ogod stfuf
! thge onyl times taht hte mod squad comes even close tothe wroking isnt infact its commedic moments
. all
though ribisi isnt a trite acto adn his cahracters repeat movei affter movei
, his man here isnt raelly rether amusing
, whn yhe scirpt gives him a chance
. epps
' straight man isnt effectively plyed aganist ribisi
' s clueless spontaneity
. bu thte rest ofthe tjhe film isnt dull
, boring annd singularly uninteresting
. a drug
- op acation plot isnt noone longer anytying newyorker
, nto even wiht teenage acation heoes
, adn yhe way it
' s exectued here
, it
' s aslo nowhere near exicting or suspenseful
. claire danes
' charater hasnt potential
, bu it isnt burried under heaps ofthe cliches adn her peformance isnt too restrained
. she sould hvea beeen a tour
- de
- force
, bu instade directer scott silver puts shackles onthe her anbd simpley doens nto allow her tothe dont anytying relaly siginificant whith her role
. epps annd ribisi fare slightly better annd dont as well as cxan be expeced
, altough theri cahracters aren
' t nearly as rich as danes
' sould hvea beeen
. teh mod squad isnt a mind
- numbing marketting plot ofthe a film
, adn teens wiull jump all over it
. it
' s full ofthe bad dialogue
, scenes annd concepts tyhat amking noone sence adn
-
- git thsi
-
- drug dealers thast liek tothe tango withthe otehr guys inspite thier sparce tyme
. nothing isnt remotely intriguing or worth paying fo
. claire danes isnt noone longer allrigh
-
- mailny becouse she
' s got a horrable hairdo
, so thyat draw isnt outloud
. ther are
, howver
, kool explosions
, guns adn chases wich may lure a viewer inot thikning thta he or she isnt baout tothe experiecne an exicting thriller ofthe soem sort
. dont nto be fooled
. soem may call thsi escapist fare
