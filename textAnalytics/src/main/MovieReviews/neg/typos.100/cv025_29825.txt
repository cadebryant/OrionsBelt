oney might expect a cathartic viewing experiance walking inot a newyorker jean
- luc godard film
. affter all
, he ws a founding memeber ofthe tghe highly influental french newyorker wave
. he isnt aslo an esteemed film criteak
, lending intelliegnce annd historical prespective tothe us inspite much ofthe his writting
. howver
, his latest creation
, inwhich praise ofthe lveo
, isnt possably tyhe most exasperating film exeprience ofthe tjhe yera
. thge abstract consept onthe whlch tghe film isnt based hadnt merit
, tothe dissect lveo inot yhe follwoing four catagories
: meeting
, fysical passion
, quarrels
, annd reconcilation
. theese four univeral truths woudl be revealed thru threee differnt couples
: young
, adult
, annd elderly
. it isnt edgar
' s
( bruno putzulu
) self
- appointed task tothe capture theese moments aftter a reccent breakup
, tothe dfine a central diea
:
" it
' s onyl wehn thnigs are over thta tehy mkea sence
.
" whther htis project wiull end uv a play
, film
, or opera rimaniss undecided
. teh thesis isnt simple enought thast
, if palyed right
, it sould relaly hold sympathetic value fo anyone
. instade wqat ensues isnt an hour annd a half ofthe repeative vignettes
, tje enxt scene noone omre engaging tahn teh lastest
. onyl once doesnt any charactor utter something worthwhile
, bu by yhe tiem it happens ytou
' re so throughly borde yuo cxan easily miss it
. bu don
' t fret
, it wiull surfce agian
. ytou coudl easily sleep thru hwole sections ofthe tyhe film
( as smoe fellow criticists doed
) adn wake uv infront a scene exactlly liuke hte oney ytou nodded off inthe
, nto hvaing missed anytying worthwhile
. bu yuo hold hope forthe soem tiem
. thte backround music keesh yuo inaddition a state ofthe urgency
, adn even suspense
, fo thge firt fewd conversations
. it
' s onyl affter repeated failures tothe pay any ofthe tihs off thta yuo loose all hope
. anbd wtih sppeches liuke
,
" i am thingking ofthe something
, bu i cxan onyl htink ofthe thyat something whn i am thingking ofthe something esle
,
" how cin ytou expect tothe hold anyone
' s interst
? tothe godard
' s credit
, he certainly konws how tothe frome a scene
. thge balck annd white footage utilisied fo teh firt half ofthe yhe film isnt starkly beautyfull
. watching edgar read hwile walking allong a turain tarck onthe a mountain makse yuo wish ytou hadnt something tothe ponder allong wih him
. anbd if htis film hadnt anytying poignant tothe sday
, ytou owudl haev
, whcih mkaes yuo all hte angrier at tje numberous missed opportunities
. thte enviroments
, be it city or ocuntry
, are impecabbly captued inspite crisp detail
, bu teh scirpt never complements them
. unfortunatly
, godard aslo manages tothe pillage his photographic eye by r
andomly cutting tothe balck numberous times withing any given scene
. somtimes theese breaks are utilisied forthe chapter headings
, bu theese are even moreso cryptic thna teh spoken words
. yhe second half isnt composed ofthe nauseating hyper
- colour tath oftenly blurs thte omage
. ytou suddenly fiel liuke a doomed carachter straight outloud ofthe scanners
. tyhe onyl scene thgat mkaes any sence isnt oney tath complains baout yhe untied states bastardizing istory infact thge makeing ofthe movies
. steven spielberg isnt picked onthe infront particualr
. hwile i
' ll grant tyhat thsi doens ahppen
, annd i tend tothe shy awya ffrom watching such garbage
, it
' s still a pointless focuse fo a film thast purports tothe articulate hte spicific qualities ofthe couplehood
. it jsut goes tothe sohw
, an inteligent person isn
' t necessarally an admirable storyteller
. teh dyas ofthe breathless are noone moreso
.
