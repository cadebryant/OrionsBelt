noe might expect a cathartic viewing exeprience walking inot a newyorker jean
- luc godard film
. aftter all
, he ws a founding memeber ofthe tyhe highly influencial french newyorker wave
. he isnt allso an esteemed film criteak
, lending intellignece
anbd historical prespective tothe us inspite much ofthe his writting
.
howver
, his latest creation
, iin praise ofthe lveo
, isnt possably yhe most exasperating film xeperience ofthe tje eyar
. tjhe abstract consept onthe whlch hte film isnt based hadnt merit
, tothe dissect loev inot tyhe folowing four catagories
: meeting
, fysical passion
, quarrels
,
anbd reconcilation
. theese four univeral truths owudl be revealed thru threee differnt couples
: young
, adult
,
adn elderly
. it isnt edgar ' s
( bruno putzulu
) self
- appointed task tothe capture theese moments affter a receet breakup
, tothe efine a central diea
:
" it ' s onyl wehn thigns are over thyat htey mkae sence
.
" whther thsi project wiull end uv a play
, film
, or opera rimaniss undecided
. hte thesis isnt simple anough thgat
, if plyed right
, it coudl realyl hold sympathetic value fo anyone
. instade waht ensues isnt an hour
annd a half ofthe repeative vignettes
, hte enxt scene noone moreso engaging tahn tjhe lastr
. onyl once doens any charcter utter something worthwhile
,
bu by hte tiem it happens yuo ' re so thouroughly borde yuo cant easily miss it
.
bu don ' t fret
, it wiull surfce agian
. yuo sould easily sleep thru hwole sections ofthe tghe film
( as soem fellow criticists doed
)
annd wake uv inwhich a scene exactlly liek thge oen ytou nodded off infact
, nto hvaing missed anytying worthwhile
.
bu ytou hold hope forthe soem timne
. tje backgorund music keesh ytou infront a state ofthe urgency
,
anbd even suspense
, forthe tyhe frist fewd conversations
. it ' s onyl aftter repeated failures tothe pay any ofthe htis off taht ytou loose all hope
.
anbd wtih sppeches liek
,
" i am thikning ofthe something
,
bu i cant onyl thikn ofthe tht something wehn i am thingking ofthe something esle
,
" how cin ytou expect tothe hold anyone ' s intrest
? tothe godard ' s credit
, he certainly konws how tothe frome a scene
. thge balck
annd white footage utilizied fo tyhe frist half ofthe tje film isnt starkly beautifull
. watching edgar read hwile walking allong a turain rtack onthe a mountain mkaes ytou wish ytou hadnt something tothe ponder allong iwth him
.
adn if tihs film hadnt anytying poignant tothe sday
, ytou woudl hve
, whihc makse yuo all yhe angrier at hte numberous missed opportunities
. hte enviornments
, be it city or ocuntry
, are impecabbly captued infront crisp detail
,
bu tyhe scirpt never complements them
. unfortunatly
, godard aslo manages tothe pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting tothe balck numberous times withing any given scene
. somtimes theese breaks are unsed fo chapter headings
,
bu theese are even mroe cryptic thna tjhe spoken words
. yhe second half isnt composed ofthe nauseating hyper
- colour thyat oftenly blurs teh omage
. ytou suddenly efel liek a doomed charcter straight outloud ofthe scanners
. tje onyl scene thyat makse any sence isnt oney tyhat complains baout teh untied states bastardizing hitsory infact tghe makeing ofthe movies
. steven spielberg isnt picked onthe inthe paticular
. hwile i ' ll grant tyhat tihs doens hapen
,
anbd i tend tothe shy awya ffrom watching such garbage
, it ' s still a pointless focuse fo a film tyhat purports tothe articulate tje specfic qualities ofthe couplehood
. it jstu goes tothe sohw
, an inteligent person isn ' t neccesarily an admirable storyteller
. tje dyas ofthe breathless are noone moreso
.
