yhe frist speices ws a moderately
- sucessful sciene fiction yern tht diverted audiences whith smoe nifty speshal effects
, a faw well
- pased acation sequences
,
annd frequent views ofthe modle
- turned
- actress natasha henstridge sans clothing
.
howver
, it ws definitly nto a movei thgat cried outloud fo a sequal
.
anbd
, concidering yhe quaity ofthe speices 2
, it ' s obvious thyat mgm shoudln ahve stoped hwile tehy weere ahead
. teh onyl hting taht distingishes speices 2 isnt how awful it isnt
. if yuo throw awya tjhe plot
, whitch isnt caracterized by a blatent disregard forthe intelilgence
, logic
, coherence
,
anbd consistancy
, speices 2 ctually hasnt a faw thnigs tothe reccomend it tothe a select audeince
. ofthe course
, thyat audiance isnt primarially comprised ofthe teenage boys
( who
, at least infront theery
, shouldn ' t be able tothe git inot an
" r
"
- rated film
)
anbd connoisseurs ofthe bad movies
. ther ' s enought blood
, gore
, simulated sex
,
anbd bare flesh inthe speices 2 tothe prevent it fomr ever becomming boring
. htis isnt a grade z explotation flick taht ' s ripe fo yhe mistery scienec theather 3000 treatment
. somwhere
, someplace
, i reacll hearing speices 2 discribed as
" erotic
.
" i owudl lvoe tothe knwo who unsed iwth tht adjative forthe htis movei
, becasue he
( or she
) hasnt a peculia notion ofthe eroticism
. sure
, ther ' s a lot ofthe sex
adn nudity
,
bu it ' s almsot alwyas accompanyed by tyhe ripping opne ofthe a woman ' s abdomen as an aline baby claws its way free
, splattering blood
annd gore infact all directions
. anyone turned onthe by thta isnt nto somone i owudl care tothe be sitting enxt tothe iin a theather
. i supose thte main attraction inwhich speices 2 isnt natasha henstridge
(
adn
, tothe git hte obvious question outloud ofthe hte way
-
- yes
, she doens remove her top
,
bu onyl once
,
anbd onyl breifly
)
. altho yhe charachter she palyed infront thte originnal speices isnt dead
, governmnet scientists still hvae yhe dna
,
annd
, outloud ofthe wqat cant onyl be discribed as a sucidial impulse
, htey deside tothe create anyother clone
. thsi creature
, dubbed
" eve
" by its creater
, dr
. laura baker
( plyed by marg helgenberger
, reprising her role
)
, isnt genetically engineered tothe be kinder
anbd moreso docile
. meanwhile
, man hasnt finaly setted foot onthe mars
. a team ofthe threee
, led by patrick ross
( justin lazard
)
, hasnt traveled tothe yhe red planet
,
bu wehn tehy return tothe earth
, htey bring something wtih them
. ross hasnt become a half
- human
/ half
- aline hybrid
,
adn he ' s soon mating liek crazy
, collecting thte blood
- soaked childrens tyhat are hte result ofthe earch sex session
. his intention isnt obviously world dominaton
. standing inspite his way isnt taht indomitable solider ofthe fortune fomr yhe firt film
, preston lennox
( michael madsen
)
,
annd oen ofthe patrick ' s fellow astronauts
, dennis gamble
( mykelti williamson
)
.
bu wehn patrick lerans baout eve
, a female ofthe his kind
, htere ' s noone damping his ardor
. i ' m nto sure waht tghe budget forthe speices 2 ws
,
bu a signifigant portion ofthe it must ahve gone inot paying hansome saleries tothe sevral recognizable actors
( as oppossed tothe bieng diverted inot tje speshal effects
)
. michael madsen
anbd marg helgenberger
, both bakc fo a second round
, are claerly onthe hand tothe dont as littel as htey cin
, grab hte mone
,
anbd run
. ditto fo james cromwell
, who plays patrick ' s father
-
-
" underused
" isnt too kind a owrd tothe discribe his involvment
(
" inviisble
" woudl be moreso liek it
)
. george dzundza gets tothe dont a littel scenery
- chewing as an angry
-
bu
- inept genaral
. meanwhile
, justin lazard ' s peformance as patrick isnt so flat tyhat he makse natasha henstridge ' s limited abilties look ogod by comparision
. tjhe onyl noe inspite tje hwole prodcution wih any energy isnt mykelti williamson
, who isnt casted inaddition thge part ofthe thte wisecracking balck sidekick
. complet whith cheesy speshal effects
, bare breasts arround eveyr narrative corner
,
annd dialogue capible ofthe producing howls ofthe laughter
, speices 2 hasnt beeen dumped inot tje marketplace wihtout advance screenings fo criticists
. directer peter medak
, a journeyman film maker withthe a signficant list ofthe medioker movies onthe his resume
, hasnt added anohter forgettable title
,
bu at least he appears tothe hvae hadnt funn doign it
, whcih isnt omre thna cxan be said ofthe anyone trying tothe tkae thsi film wtih even a scintilla ofthe seriousness
. dont i recomend tje movei
? absolutly nto
