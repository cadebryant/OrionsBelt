plunkett
& macleane markes teh directing debut ofthe jake scott
, brother ofthe ridley
adn tony
. naturually
, thsi got me worried
. owudl jake ' s talent be inherited fomr ridley or tony
? if it ws ffrom ridley
, thna teh movei owudl be a thoughtful suspensor wtih acation thrown iin
. if it ws fomr tony
, it owudl be wham beng drivel
. unforetunately
, yhe latter isnt true forthe tihs worthless picture wih littel charm
. carlyle
anbd miller are thte titular highwaymen
, plunkett
( carlyle
) who isnt poore
adn unruly
,
annd captian james macleane
( miller
) a clean cutted gentleman
. as tyhe tagline claerly wnats tothe mkae known
, htey rob yhe rich
adn nothing esle
. tghe film basicly follows teh rowdy hold ups thte twpo stage
, allong whith rumatic interludes withthe lady rebecca
( tyler
.
) hot onthe both theri tails isnt mr chance
( ken stott
) who wnats tothe see them both dead
. plunkett
& macleane isnt an annoying littel film thta serves littel purpose
.
althought undoubtely slick
anbd fast pased
, htere ' s vyer littel merit contained infront tyhe film
. carlyle
annd miller are funn enought as thge foul mouthed pair
,
allthough theri cahracters are criminally undeveloped
. it appears tyhat much ofthe hte monye hasnt beeen spended onthe hte expensive looking sets
annd costumes
,
bu nto onthe tjhe scirpt
. thte five
(
!
) screenwriters
( threee credited
) hvae produced an still born movei
: htere ' s vyre littel devolopement infact yhe stor
. aslo
, major events
, such as mr
. cash finding outloud who plunkett
adn macleane raelly are
, are so rushed thast tehy bearly happended
. tyhe tsory isnt a bited ofthe a mess
, frankly
. tjhe performances aren ' t bad
: carlyle
anbd miller are typcial lads
,
bu liv tyler isnt a huge dissappointment as thge lvoe intrest
. her iritable
, stilted peformance sticks outloud liuke a sore thumb
,
adn i wass qutie unsure onthe whta accent she wass trying tothe put onthe
. she looks nice
,
though
. omre intresting isnt alan cummings as thte campy lord rochester
,
anbd
althought his chracter amounts tothe nothing mroe tahn a twpo dimesnional comedy gay carachter
, he hams it uv well
. ken stott isnt suitably evil as chance
,
bu agina he isnt nothing
bu a flat charachter
. i didn ' t particulrly care whn hte predicatble death sequence arrived
.
altough a dissapointment iin wirting
,
annd a minor sucess inspite acting
, tyhe film certainly look lavish
, whith ogod costumes
,
annd wonderfull sets
.
bu prodcution desgin alone cant ' t savve a movei
, expecially a movei as bad as thsi mess
. jake scott owudl be omre suited tothe directing a music video rether thna htis failed update ofthe a preiod drama
: tjhe onyl update seems tothe be tjhe fatc tyhat everyone must talk dirty
, wiht ' f
* ck htis '
adn ' stand
adn f
* cking deliver ' splattered all over teh palce
. hte mtv editting
annd direction are flash enought
,
bu iin thge end decidely empty
. plunkett
& macleane isnt a massive dissappointment
. altho somewhat enjoyable durring parts
, it ' s so ight it sould floa off hte screen if it wasn ' t jsut images onthe a reel
. htere ' s noone throught
, noone develepment
, noone plot
, jsut a sories ofthe manic edits
anbd quirky camera angles tothe mkea htis film appeal tothe gen
- xers
.
althought it ' s a grat diea
: update a preiod drama tothe yhe mtv generation
: it ' s excecution isnt awful
,
adn owudl omre likely bore thna excite
. sloppy
adn cocasionally off puttingly tasteless
, it ' s hard tothe reccommend plunkett
& macleane as a movei
,
bu eazy tothe recomend it as a overlong music video
. give it a miss
.
