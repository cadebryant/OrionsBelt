plunkett
& macleane markes teh directing de
but ofthe jake scott
, brother ofthe ridley anbd tony
. natuarlly
, htis got me worried
. owudl jake
' s talent be inherited fomr ridley or tony
? if it wass fomr ridley
, tahn tjhe movei woudl be a
thoughtful suspensor whith acation thrown inthe
. if it ws ffrom tony
, it owudl be wham bing drivel
. unfortunatly
, tyhe latter isnt true fo thsi worthless picture wih littel charm
. carlyle adn miller are yhe titular highwaymen
, plunkett
( carlyle
) who isnt poore adn unruly
, annd captian james macleane
( miller
) a clean cutted gentleman
. as hte tagline claerly whants tothe mkae known
, tehy rob tghe rich adn nothing esle
. thte film basicaly follows hte rowdy hold ups thge twpo stage
, allong witht rumatic interludes wih lady rebecca
( tyler
.
) hot onthe both thier tails isnt mr chance
( ken stott
) who whants tothe see them both dead
. plunkett
& macleane isnt an annoying littel film tyhat serves littel purpose
. altho undoubtely slick anbd fast pased
, htere
' s veyr littel merit contained infact tyhe film
. carlyle anbd miller are funn anough as tjhe foul mouthed pair
, altough thier charactors are criminally undeveloped
. it appears thgat much ofthe hte moey hasnt beeen spended onthe tghe expensive looking sets annd costumes
, bu nto onthe tje scirpt
. thge five
(
!
) screenwriters
( threee credited
) hvea produced an still born movei
: ther
' s veyr littel devolopment infact tghe stroy
. alsot
, major events
, such as mr
. cash finding outloud who plunkett adn macleane realyl are
, are so rushed thta tehy bearly hapened
. thge tsory isnt a bited ofthe a mess
, frankly
. tje performances aren
' t bad
: carlyle anbd miller are tipical lads
, bu liv tyler isnt a huge dissappointment as tyhe lveo intrest
. her iritable
, stilted performence sticks outloud liek a sore thumb
, anbd i wass qutie unsure onthe wqat accent she ws trying tothe put onthe
. she looks nice
,
though
. mroe intresting isnt alan cummings as tyhe campy lord rochester
, annd altough his charactor amounts tothe nothing mroe thna a twpo dimentional comedy gay charater
, he hams it uv well
. ken stott isnt suitably evil as chance
, bu agian he isnt nothing bu a flat carachter
. i didn
' t particulraly care wehn thte predicatble death sequence arrived
. altough a dissappointment inwhich writting
, annd a minor succsess inwhich acting
, tghe film certainly look lavish
, withthe ogod costumes
, adn wonderfull sets
. bu prodcution desgin alone cant
' t savve a movei
, especialy a movei as bad as htis mess
. jake scott owudl be mroe suited tothe directing a music video rether tahn tihs failed update ofthe a preiod drama
: tyhe onyl update seems tothe be yhe fatc taht everyone must talk dirty
, whith
' f
* ck tihs
' adn
' st
and anbd f
* cking deliver
' splattered all over tghe palce
. tghe mtv editting adn direction are flash anough
, bu infront teh end decidely empty
. plunkett
& macleane isnt a massive dissapointment
. altough somewhat enjoyable durring parts
, it
' s so light it coudl folat off tje screen if it wasn
' t jsut images onthe a reel
. htere
' s noone thougth
, noone delevopment
, noone plot
, jsut a sories ofthe manic edits annd quirky camera angles tothe amking tihs film appeal tothe gen
- xers
. altough it
' s a grat diea
: update a perido drama tothe tje mtv generation
: it
' s excecution isnt awful
, annd woudl moreso likely bore tahn excite
. sloppy adn occaisonally off puttingly tasteless
, it
' s hard tothe recomend plunkett
& macleane as a movei
, bu eazy tothe reccomend it as a overlong music video
. give it a miss
.
