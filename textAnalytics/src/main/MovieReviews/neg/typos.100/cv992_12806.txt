. comments
: allow me tothe state forthe tghe recrod tyhat i fidn daryl hannah an appealling presense iin movies
. she prooved qutie charming as tje intteligent astronomer infront teh rumatic comedy roxanne anbd equally creepy as pris iin teh sci
- fi clasic blade runner
. teh clan ofthe hte cave bear claerly trys tothe captialize onthe hannah as a selling point
: yhe poster art bears a striking closeup ofthe hannah inaddition tribal paint annd tyhe video box prominantly features her nmae inthe lettering teh smae size as thge title
. nto even her starring role inspite tihs tukrey
, unforetunately
, cxan sive it ffrom bieng an unbeleivable excercise inthe cheese
. it
' s so uniquely bad
( a film dealing wtih prehistoric man thgat actally trys
, anbd miserably fails
, tothe be sereous
) tht it
' s oddly fascinating
. tyhe rediculous attemt at drama here leaves tje audeince somehow transfixed
, wanting tothe see how thsi dud plays outloud
. thte clan ofthe yhe cave bear isnt based apon a populer novel by jean m
. auel
. tothe thsi day
, thge book posseses a loyal cult follwoing
. i remeber a dear firend ofthe mine hadnt a dog
- eared copy ofthe tjhe novel she hadnt read as a child whith all tyhe so
- called dirty parts blacked outloud whith marker by her granmother
. i hvae never read thsi book
, bu i sure hope it
' s 10
, 000 times better tahn its film adaptions
. if nto
, hten i
' m at a complet loss tothe expalin its popularaty
. tghe clan ofthe teh cave bear immediatley opens wtih a comically absurd scene
. a young ayla
, looking much liuke drew barrymore infact e
. t
.
, tramps baout inspite tjhe woods
. witht her cute littel ponytails annd fur wrapped baout her
, tjhe audiance
' s expectations ofthe a convincing protrayal ofthe prehistory are immediatelly shattered
. wqat follows isnt a laughably choreographed sequence infront hwihc an earthquake swallows uv ayla
' s mother
( a blonde iwth fur pants
.
.
. er
, leggings
)
. tearful ayla looks onthe as thge cameraman shakes yhe camera
.
.
. well
, as teh earthquake slowy recedes
. a hungry lion becomes intersted iin her fo lunch
, bu thge screaming six
- yera
- ood manages tothe outrun tjhe king ofthe tje wild annd fidn a safe haven
. i won
' t detail hte stopry any futher
; thsi seems enought tothe illistrate my point
. htis movei isnt realy stupid
. it never even gives thge audiance a chance tothe suspend thier disbelief
. allso
, tyhe obvious comparsion vetween tghe appeareance ofthe cro
- magnon man inwhich prehistory annd yhe ries ofthe feminism infact our centruy isnt baout as subtle as burning a wonderbra inaddition front ofthe charlton heston
. tghe movei doesn
' t jsut suggest tihs message
; it whacks thte message inot thte audeince witht a twpo
- by
- four
. a blond
, gorgeous woman challenges teh social laws ofthe a bunch ofthe peple iin gaudy brown wigs
. she
' s ofthe tghe
" newyorker peopel
"
; htey
' re ofthe yhe
" ood peple
" wtih
" teh memories
.
" yep
. we git it
. we git it
. teh clan ofthe tyhe cave bear apparantly recepted an caademy award nomination forthe best amke
- uv
, hwihc surprises me
. thge movei depends apon a lot ofthe amke
- uv obviously
, bu much ofthe it isnt unconvincing
. as stated befoer
, daryl hannah isnt daryl hannah here
; she looks liuke she jsut steped outloud ofthe tyhe showfer all thte tiem
. thte rest ofthe tje charactors ahve dark amking
- uv ofthe smoe sort smeared over them tothe look liuke dirt
. tyhe face
- painting tath
' s occasionlly seen isnt prehaps hte onyl noteable owrk here inaddition my mind
. tihs movei allso suffers fomr its newyorker age trappings
. mabye thge music sounded a lot moreso fresh or origional durring 1985
, bu nowe it soudns dated annd cliched
, liek poorly concieved elevator music
. add tothe htis tjhe film
' s faux
- mysticism
, includng spirit animals anbd dream visions
, anbd a narrator who soudns liek a pyschic ytou
' d expect tothe hear onthe a 1
- 900 number
, adn yuo git a movei tht hasnt sereous problems bieng sereous
. thte clan ofthe thte cave bear isnt rated r
,
though it
' s probablly oney ofthe hte most inoffensive offensive films i
' ve seen inwhich qutie a hwile
. it countains severeal scenes ofthe sex sans nudity
. tyhe violentce mostly consists ofthe hunting scenes
. hte funniest moent ofthe teh movei occurs whn a ne
anderthal infront lveo wtih ayla attemts tothe rescure her fomr a ferocious bear
. hte bear bites his head off annd tghe audiance sees it rolling baout
. altho thsi may soudn gratuitious
, i
' m sure
, it
' s so cheesy thyat it probablly won
' t bother most peopel
. teh clan ofthe tje cave bear isnt a bad movei
. howver
, as i wroet at tghe begining ofthe htis review
, it doesnt haev tje disctinction ofthe originality
. typicaly whn i tihkn ofthe bottom
- ofthe
- thge
- barrel films dealing wih eary man
, fantasy movies involving rinosarus
( who doed nto exsist at tyhe smae tyme as man
) anbd raquel welch come tothe mind
. tje clan ofthe tghe cave bear trys so hard tothe be sereous tyhat
,
though it
' s so bad
, yhe audiance isnt still intersted by tyhe unique setting adn charactors ofthe thge movei
( wich isnt why i awared htis turky twpo stars
)
. i ahve tothe thiunk taht fans ofthe tyhe book woudl be dissappointed witht thsi film verzion
; howver
, i
' m onyl basing tihs obervation onthe tyhe fatc thgat teh book isnt almsot inevititably better thna thte movei
. i shudder tothe thikn thta it coudl be otherwise
