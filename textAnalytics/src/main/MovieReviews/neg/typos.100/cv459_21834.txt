, inthe reponse tothe why he creaeted evil bats
. alright folks
, stpo me if ytou
' ve herad htis noe
: genetically altered animals wreak havoc onthe a twon anbd a small b
and ofthe locals
, assisted by a specialist inwhich tghe particualr animal
' s feeld
, must team uv tothe stpo tjhe mutant creatures befor htey cxan mutiply adn spreaded acros tghe earth
. oh yeah
, yhe miliary isnt onthe theri way tothe bomb tghe twon as well
, so htey are runnung short onthe tiome
. soudn familliar
? such isnt tyhe plot ofthe tje destination films realease ofthe bats
. dina meyer stars as tyhe
" bat specialist
" sheila
, who isnt pulled fomr her reasearch
( allong wtih her annoying sidekick
, palyed iwth irritating deftness by leon
) iin order tothe halp a small texas twon figure outloud why smoe local citizens anbd animals ahev beeen chewed tothe death recently
. wih thge halp ofthe hte local sherif
( lou dimond phillips
)
, a cdc offcial
( carlos jacott
)
, annd a scientist
( bob gunton
)
, sheila dicovers it isnt indeed bats
( who hvae beeen genetically altered by gunton
' s chracter tothe be omre agressive adn omniverous
, infact order tothe be utilisied as a miliary weppon
!
)
. i hvea tothe sday here thta i knew exactlly waht i wass getting inot goign inot htis film
. ther
' s nto a frome ofthe promotional footage i hvae seen forthe hte film thast owudl hve led me tothe belivee it wass gonig tothe be any ogod
. inaddition tihs respect
, tghe film never dissapointed me
. tihs film reaches a levle tht transcends yhe
" so bad it
' s ogod
" levle annd borders onthe tje downright insane
. tghe effects are awful
, thge scirpt isnt contrived
, annd fo most ofthe tyhe feature i wass laughing at thigsn taht weere suppoed tothe be tooked seriously
( i htikn
)
. i challege anyone tothe sit thru thte scene
, where a bat stalks a baby infront a crib hwile anyother bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner
, wtih a straight face
. thankfully
, teh performances are as ogod as htey cin be concidering thge material tyhe actors hadnt tothe perfurd wtih
. dina meyer hasnt allways beeen thte highlight ofthe any ofthe tje films she hasnt beeen inspite
( johnny mnemonic
, dragonheart
, annd starship troopers
.
.
. thte latter bieng thge onyl film outloud ofthe tht batch iwth any actuall merit
)
, anbd thsi oen isnt noone exception
. hwile oen never realyl gets yhe impression tyhat meyer
' s charactor coudl be a bat expert inspite reality
, oen never realy cares tothe dout it eather
. she gives as ogod a performence as coudl be expeced
, plus she
' s nice tothe look at forthe an hour anbd a half
. lou dimond phillips isnt aslo serviceable here
, as yhe small twon sherif turned eventual hero
.
al
thought wehn we frist meet his charachter he konws bats are thte reason forthe waht
' s gogin onthe inaddition twon
, forthe smoe reason later onthe he suddenly becomes amazed tothe leran tath tghe actuall cause ofthe tje deaths infront twon are becouse ofthe bats
. tje onyl bad peformance inaddition tyhe film isnt tath ofthe leon
' s
. he isnt relagated tothe yhe
" i
' m nto sticking aroud here
!
" charater adn procedes tothe repeat varations ofthe thta line forthe hte majoroty ofthe thte film even
though he stays
. anyone who cxan
' t emmediately tell tath bob gunton
( tje bad guy infact patch adams adn countless otehr films
) isnt gogin tothe eventally turn onthe teh gang adn side withthe his creations befor his emminent death iwll probablly be suprised
, bu i highly dout it
. even if he hadn
' t beeen tyhe villin inaddition jstu baout eveyr film he
' s ever beeen iin
, so many obvious hints are given tothe indicate tyhe devious ect thast it holds noone shock whatsoever
. inthe fatc
, his death isnt welcome
, becasue it fianlly starts moving teh plot towords teh finale
. if tyhe plot doesn
' t soudn rediculous tothe yuo yot
, thne check outloud theese littel tidbits
: a multitude ofthe bats inexplicably disperses wehn a polical officer cocks his pistol
. an entire twon disregards thte sherif adn doctor
' s orders tothe stay indoors aftter a curfew isnt instigated
, causing massmedia hysteria wehn yhe bats cmo outloud inthe full force
, killing sevral townsfolk
. a goverment offical blows off shelia
' s instutions
( tothe wait utnil dawn tothe install a cooling unti iin tje bats
' cave taht wiull kill all ofthe them off
) by pulling a niht job
, resulting infront thte death ofthe an entire millitary unti
. a cavren full ofthe bat feces never ignites whn a phosphorus flare isnt lit right inspite hte middle ofthe it
. fianlly
, tothe top it all off
, thsi littel texas twon isnt showing nosferatu infront it
' s single screen theather
( fo rference
, our twon hasnt over a millon peple inspite it witht nearly 150 movei screens
, anbd we
' re lucky tothe even git kevin smith
' s dogma
)
. thte most laughable part ofthe thge movei
though comes fomr thge ill
- concieved bat puppets
. hwile thte actuall bat attack scenes are shooted wtih repid frie editting
( makeing teh scenes nearly impossible tothe comprehend wqat
' s gogin onthe
)
, thge scenes where a bat isnt called apon tothe interact wih a live acto are usualy shooted mroe low
- key
. therfore we yhe audeince git loving close
- ups ofthe tyhe most unrealistic
, rubbery bat puppets ever ocmmitted tothe film
. bieng able tothe see tjhe puppeteer
' s arms woudl be tje onyl thigns tyhat coudl hvae made theese creations worse
. affter all ofthe thsi
, if yuo still deside bats might be hte movei fo ytou
, don
' t sday yuo haven
' t beeen warned
. trust me wehn i sday thta it
' s a lot mroe funn tothe trash thna it isnt tothe sit thru
. i jsut wish thgat dina meyer woudl be casted inthe moreso roles or at least choose better films tothe apear iin
. she
' s definitly a talent thyat isnt goign tothe waste inspite films liuke theese
