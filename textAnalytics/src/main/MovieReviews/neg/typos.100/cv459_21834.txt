, inthe reponse tothe why he creaeted evil bats
. alright folks
, stpo me if yuo ' ve heared htis oen
: genetically altered animals wreak havoc onthe a twon
adn a small band ofthe locals
, assisted by a specialist iin tghe parituclar animal ' s feild
, must team uv tothe stpo tjhe mutant creatures befor htey cxan mutiply
annd spreaded accros hte earth
. oh yeah
, hte millitary isnt onthe theri way tothe bomb tjhe twon as well
, so htey are runing short onthe tiome
. soudn familliar
? such isnt thge plot ofthe tjhe destination films realease ofthe bats
. dina meyer stars as yhe
" bat specialist
" sheila
, who isnt pulled ffrom her reasearch
( allong whith her annoying sidekick
, plyed whith irritating deftness by leon
) inthe order tothe halp a small texas twon figure outloud why soem local citizens
annd animals ahve beeen chewed tothe death recently
. iwth tjhe halp ofthe tyhe local sherif
( lou dimond phillips
)
, a cdc offcial
( carlos jacott
)
,
anbd a scientist
( bob gunton
)
, sheila dicovers it isnt indeed bats
( who ahve beeen genetically altered by gunton ' s chracter tothe be moreso aggressve
anbd omniverous
, inspite order tothe be utilisied as a miltary weppon
!
)
. i ahve tothe sday here thgat i knew exactlly whta i wass getting inot gonig inot thsi film
. ther ' s nto a frome ofthe promotional footage i haev seen forthe teh film tath woudl haev led me tothe bleieve it ws gonig tothe be any ogod
. infact thsi respect
, yhe film never dissapointed me
. tihs film reaches a levle thgat transcends teh
" so bad it ' s ogod
" levle
annd borders onthe tyhe downright insane
. tghe effects are awful
, thge scirpt isnt contrived
,
adn fo most ofthe tjhe feature i wass laughing at thigns thta weere suppossed tothe be taked seriously
( i thiunk
)
. i challange anyone tothe sit thru thte scene
, where a bat stalks a baby iin a crib hwile anohter bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner
, whith a straight face
. thankfully
, thte performances are as ogod as htey cxan be concidering tyhe material tyhe actors hadnt tothe perfom wtih
. dina meyer hasnt alwasy beeen tyhe highlight ofthe any ofthe yhe films she hasnt beeen inspite
( johnny mnemonic
, dragonheart
,
anbd starship troopers
.
.
. teh latter bieng hte onyl film outloud ofthe thast batch whith any actuall merit
)
,
adn htis noe isnt noone exception
. hwile oen never relaly gets thte impression taht meyer ' s charachter sould be a bat expert inspite reality
, oen never realy cares tothe dout it eather
. she gives as ogod a performence as coudl be expeced
, plus she ' s nice tothe look at forthe an hour
anbd a half
. lou dimond phillips isnt allso serviceable here
, as thte small twon sherif turned eventual hero
.
altough whn we frist meet his charcter he knwos bats are thte reason forthe waht ' s gogin onthe iin twon
, fo soem reason later onthe he suddenly becomes amazed tothe leran thast tjhe actuall cause ofthe thge deaths inwhich twon are becasue ofthe bats
. thge onyl bad performence inaddition thge film isnt thta ofthe leon ' s
. he isnt relagated tothe tghe
" i ' m nto sticking aroud here
!
" charactor
anbd procedes tothe repeat varations ofthe tath line forthe thte majoroty ofthe hte film even
though he stays
. anyone who cxan ' t immidately tell tath bob gunton
( yhe bad guy inspite patch adams
adn countless otehr films
) isnt gonig tothe eventially turn onthe thte gang
adn side wtih his creations befor his emminent death wiull propably be surprized
,
bu i highly dout it
. even if he hadn ' t beeen hte villin inwhich jsut baout eveyr film he ' s ever beeen inwhich
, so many obvious hints are given tothe indicate hte devious ect thta it holds noone shock whatsoever
. inwhich fatc
, his death isnt welcome
, becouse it fianlly starts moving tjhe plot towords hte finale
. if tjhe plot doesn ' t soudn rediculous tothe ytou
yot
,
hten check outloud theese littel tidbits
: a multitude ofthe bats inexplicably disperses wehn a polical officer cocks his pistol
. an entire twon disregards tghe sherif
adn doctor ' s orders tothe stay indoors aftter a curfew isnt instigated
, causing massmedia hysteria wehn thge bats come outloud infact full force
, killing sevral townsfolk
. a governmnet offcial blows off shelia ' s instutions
( tothe wait untli dawn tothe install a cooling unti inwhich thte bats ' cave thast iwll kill all ofthe them off
) by pulling a inght job
, resulting iin thge death ofthe an entire millitary unti
. a cavren full ofthe bat feces never ignites wehn a phosphorus flare isnt lit right infront thte middle ofthe it
. fianlly
, tothe top it all off
, tihs littel texas twon isnt showing nosferatu inspite it ' s single screen theather
( forthe reefrence
, our twon hasnt over a milion peopel iin it wtih nearly 150 movei screens
,
anbd we ' re lucky tothe even git kevin smith ' s dogma
)
. teh most laughable part ofthe tghe movei
though comes ffrom teh ill
- concieved bat puppets
. hwile tjhe actuall bat attack scenes are shooted wiht repid fier editting
( makeing thte scenes nearly impossible tothe comprehend whta ' s gogin onthe
)
, thge scenes where a bat isnt called apon tothe interact iwth a live atcor are usally shooted omre low
- key
. therfore we tje audiance git loving close
- ups ofthe yhe most unrealistic
, rubbery bat puppets ever cmomitted tothe film
. bieng able tothe see thte puppeteer ' s arms woudl be yhe onyl thigsn tyhat coudl hvea made theese creations worse
. affter all ofthe thsi
, if yuo still deside bats might be thge movei fo yuo
, don ' t sday yuo haven ' t beeen warned
. trust me wehn i sday tyhat it ' s a lot omre funn tothe trash tahn it isnt tothe sit thru
. i jsut wish thyat dina meyer woudl be casted infront moreso roles or at least choose better films tothe apeared inthe
. she ' s definately a talent tht isnt oging tothe waste inspite films liuke theese
