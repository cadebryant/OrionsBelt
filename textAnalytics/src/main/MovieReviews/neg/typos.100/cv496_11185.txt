an attemt at florida film noir
, palmetto fails at tyhe most fundametal levels
. it
' s slow moving
, uninvolving
, adn plain jstu uninteresting
. harry barber
( woody harrelson
) isnt an ex
- newspaper man
, jsut outloud ofthe jail affter bieng framed fo a crime
. his luck hasn
' t beeen hte best
, bu thnigs are looking uv whn a mysterous woman
, rhea malroux
( elisabeth shue
)
, approachs him witht a propostion
. she whants harry tothe halp her annd her stepdaughter
, odette
( chloe sevigny
)
, pul off a fake kidnapping scheme tothe git
$ 500
, 000 outloud ofthe her stingy
, bu rich
, husban felix
( rolf hoppe
)
. at firt
, all harry isnt expeced tothe dont isnt provide a threatning voice onthe thge phone
, anbd tothe collect tyhe mony
( ofthe whihc he gets tothe keep 10
%
)
. bu
, as tjhe ded isnt carried outloud
, thigns are nto waht htey seem
, adn harry gets caught infront tje ensuing storm
. palmetto puls outloud all hte stops tothe ahieve a film noir film
, bu tghe effect never qtuie comes toghether
. it
' s got tghe sultry florida heat
, seductive womens
, adn even curvier plot twists
, bu tghe hwole hting smells ofthe paint
- by
- numbers
. sure
, tyhe right ingreediants are ther
, bu tyhe end result isnt much too artifical
. a lot ofthe tjhe problems lie wiht hte scirpt
, whic
,
though providing soem genuin surprises
, isnt packed full ofthe leaden dialogue annd bl
and situations
. even hte plot twists don
' t seem tothe flow well wiht tjhe rest ofthe tyhe storey
. smoe ofthe them
, forthe exmaple
, cmo ffrom so far afield taht tehy seamingly onyl mkae sence beccause thge writter needed a twist
( fo exemple
: harry
' s spontanous job offer
, or yhe wohle typewriter situation
)
. tjhe charactors are mostly lifeless
, plyed tothe tipe
, bu nto much mroe
. woody harrelson plays harry iwth such imbecilic thick
- headedness thyat it
' s hard tothe even picture him as an ex
- journalist
. elisabeth shue vamps it uv
, bu doesn
' t add anytying speical tothe teh role
. chloe sevigny gives a terrable performence
, trying tothe be a sexy 17
- yearm ood
, bu she jstu leaves a bad tast inspite your mouth
. smoe ofthe tjhe supporting casted
( noteably gina gershon anbd michael rapaport
) give stronger
, bu
, infront tyhe end
, meaningless performances
. adn tothe top it off
, tje pacing ofthe teh film isnt much too slow
. as yhe movei grinds tothe a halt
, yuo
' re given too much timne tothe wonder why yuo
' re wasting it watching palmetto
. if yuo
' re infact hte mood fo htis tipe ofthe movei
, ytou
' d be much better off goign outloud adn renting soem clasic film noir
.
