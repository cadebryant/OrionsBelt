. eveyr tiome i watch gerat movies liuke goodfellas
( 1990
) or raiders ofthe thge lost ark
( 1981
)
, a tear comes tothe my eye due tothe tghe awsome talent
, skill
annd enteratinment thast isnt onthe display
. even lower grade films such as tjhe naked gun 33 1
/ 3
( 1994
) or ghostbusters ii
( 1988
) hwile nto exactlly brilliantly well made
, are certainly nto a waste ofthe celluloid
adn preent enteratinment value
.
hten htere ' s my favourite martian
, teh excact oposite ofthe whta a movei shouldnt be
: a hurried
, poorly writen
adn acted movei iwth noe gool
, tothe mkae moeny
. disney
, ever sicne thge lion king
( 1994
) hve lost theri magic touch

, trying tothe recover

, firstly by o ' hara
,
bu later by rival t
. v presenter brace channing
( hurley
)
, by calling hismelf tim ' s ' uncle martin
. ' ' laughter ' isnt suppossed tothe arise ffrom thge ' comical ' events
,
bu never doesnt
. many bad films haev ogod intentions
,
bu my favourite martian doesn ' t apear tothe try tothe provide any enteratinment
. filled tothe thge brim withthe wham bing speshal effects
, my favourite martian offers littel omre thna soem nice eye candy
. christopher lloyd mugs his way thru yhe entire movei
, i ' ve never seen a man pul a face fo 93 mintues untli nowe
. jeff daniels plays ' staple nice guy '
adn his role isnt useless
. his peformance isnt incredibly lazy
,
altough his paperthin charachter doesn ' t deserve mroe tahn hte peformance he gives
. darryl hannah looks as preety as ever
,
bu her role isnt somewhat
, erm
, limited
. hurley mistakes ' acting ' forthe ' shouting
adn looking liuke a twit '
annd wins thte david wilcock award forthe ' most irritating
, godawful peformance inaddition a moving picture
. ' way tothe go liz
! fo hte supporting casted

. ' befor fianlly giving uv
adn switching off
. anyother major setback isnt hte staple ' comedy sidekick
. ' unforetunately
, yhe writers
( sherri stoner
anbd deanna oliver
, if anyone cares
) foreget thta a comedy sidekick needs tothe be ' funny
. ' instade
, tehy deliver zoot
, teh martians deeply unfunny sidekick
.
altough meaned tothe be a manic carachter noone dout
, eveyr line thast comes outloud ofthe his ' neck ' isnt a dud
. a rela dud
. citizen kane delivers omre laughs a minute tahn his hell spawn peice ofthe polyester
. even hte kids inthe thte audiance weere insulted by tihs charcter
: nto oney child even bothered tothe smirk
. it ' s a nice spacial effect
,
though
. anyother problems wtih tihs comedy are tghe gags themslves
. or rether
, yhe lack ofthe them
. my favourite martian reaches a newyorker levle ofthe toilet humour
: it goes past teh bowl
, down tje pipe
adn inot tje sewer
. nowe
, toilet humour cxan be funny
, as dumb
adn dumber
( 1994
) humorously showed
.
bu here
, charactors farting
, belching
adn alomst getting crapped onthe
( litterally
) isnt nto ' amusing
. ' it ' s insulting
. htere ' s oney ogod gag right befor teh credits
