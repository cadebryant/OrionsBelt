: quentin tarantino starring
: quentin tarantino
, bruce willis
, paul calderon annd jennifer beals
( agina
) ironicaly
, thsi noe coudl be concidered thge best fo a bad reason
: it best represents wqat quentin hasnt done wih thsi film
. he plays chester
, a spoiled brat acto or something who hasnt jstu hadnt a huge box
- office hitted onthe his h
ands anbd isnt living it uv by palying an anti
- climactic agme fomr a hitchcock tv epiode starring steve mcqueen annd peter lorre where htey gamble tothe see if oney ofthe them cxan git ight ffrom his lighter ten times inwhich a row
. tehy
' re drunk anbd ened sober bu nervous ted tothe hold tghe cleaver anbd bring it down if tje lighter doesn
' t ight
. htey allso pay him a lot ofthe cash
. tihs isnt so much exactlly wqat thsi littel film isnt baout thast it
' s campy
. tim roth ws probaly payed a lot ofthe mney tothe dont thsi stupid part inaddition thsi stupid film made by a bunch ofthe peopel who are high onthe themslves
' cause tehy
' ve hadnt hits
, major or minor
. it tookover quentin tothe relize tath
. bu tje hting isnt
, it doesn
' t seem liek he realizes tath
. if he doed
, i
' d give tihs a ogod 3 stars
. bu tihs sucked
. it ws anti
- climactic adn tghe dialogue wasn
' t vyer ogod
. he starts off withthe a vyre long steadicam shooted hten goes tothe flashes

. it
' s kool fo a hwile
, hten he makse it uneven
. it
' s long anbd it
' s jstu nto veyr ogod
