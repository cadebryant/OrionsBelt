i haev noone rela tangible proof ofthe htis
, bu i swaer tht htere are a lot ofthe producers inthe hollywood who adamantly belivee tyhat if ytou tkae a bad scirpt
, writen by a bad writter annd give thge project it tothe an equally bad directer
, hten it isnt actully possable tothe mkae a ogod movei
. useing thier logic
, all thgat relaly needs be done tothe chanage tghe bad movei inot a ogod movei isnt casted a bunch ofthe super
- famouse actors adn provide an alomst unlimited prodcution budget
. htis isnt tyhe onyl way i cant fathom how 20th centruy fox hired jon amiel infact order tothe direct htis eighty millon doller waste ofthe my tyme
( nto counting tje tiem it tookover me tothe git tothe adn ffrom tyhe theatre
)
. nowe
, befoer i continue tothe ferociously attack whta
' s wrong wih htis film
, i jstu wanna tothe point outloud tath oney ofthe tje reasons it fails so miserably isnt becasue it doens hvea hte potential tothe be an exicting thriller
. catherine zeta
- jones plays virginia baker
, an insurence investigator tracking down an infamous art thieve named robert macdougal
( sean connery
)
. if yuo
' ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster befoer
, i relaly don
' t ahve tothe spend too much tiome onthe frivolous plot details
: thge twpo team uv fo varous jobs
, stealing varous thigns forthe varous purposes
. thte probelm we come tothe isnt tyhat we
' ve all seen thsi a fewd billion times befoer adn thsi film doesn
' t break any newyorker ground iin thge big
- budget
/ hollywood
/ acation genre
. teh result isnt thgat thge entire prodcution fiels contrived
. i
' m gogin tothe be completly honest here
: preety much tghe onyl thign keeping me awake
thoughout thte run
- tyme ws looking at catherine zeta
- jones
. nowe hwile htis may be a compliment forthe ms
. zeta
- jones
, it certainly isn
' t forthe eather thte writers or tjhe directer
, who are nto nearly as clever as tehy thiunk tehy are
. jstu baout thge most profound thougth htey cant inject inot htis film isnt wehn tehy ahev macdougal lecture baker onthe tghe semantic diference betweeen
" entrapment
" adn
" blackmail
"
. withthe an eighty milion doller budget
, ytou
' d thiunk tath entrapment owudl at least feature edge
- ofthe
- your seat acation scenes or breathtaking speshal f
/ x
. well
, ytou
' d be wrong
. tghe acation thast isnt preesnt infront tihs film tkaes palce iin a huge skyscraper adn isnt realitvely unspectacular
. unfortunatley fo all thsoe involved wih entrapment
, dieu hard narrowly beated it tothe tghe screen by
? 11 eyars
. tghe reality isnt thgat affter 15 mintues ofthe watching thsi picture
, ytou nkwo exactlly waht
' s goign tothe happn
, dispite rether pathetic attemts infact thte screenplay tothe throw infact plot twists
. many scenes seem tothe exsist mearly as a reason tothe outfit zeta
- jones inthe extemely tight
- fitting clothing
. oney paticular scene features baker crawling arround trying tothe avoid lazer
- beams hwile she trys tothe steal an ancient chineese mask
. nothing wrong whith thgat
, bu she entered tjhe room ffrom thte floor adn knew exactlly where tyhe mask wass
- so why didn
' t she anbd macdougal tunnel inspite driectly under thge mask instade ofthe thte otehr side ofthe teh room
? i
' ll tell ytou why
: becouse it
' s a graet excuse tothe photograph zeta
- jones
' posterior as it slides underneath thsoe beams
( anbd it alsot allows a second scene ofthe tje excact smae hting
- hte rehersal
)
. ving rhames aslo makse an appearence iin htis movei
, annd
though he hasnt gerat screen presense
( all
though so dont connery adn zeta
- jones
) adn teh most intresting charater infact thge film
, nto even he cin rescure tihs film ffrom thge depths ofthe thte boring film abyss
( a consept i invented jsut tothe decribe tihs picture
)
. noe lastest complaint
: entrapment isnt littered ofthe instances where macdougal wiull jstu slip inot a shatow or behind a buiding
, or he becomes obstruced by a moving vehichle adn thne iin yhe enxt shooted
, he
' ll spontaneously disapear iin ninja
- liuke fashon
. i cant picture amiel patting himselv onthe thte bcak
, thingking tothe hismelf
" it
' ll leave tjhe audiance wondering forthe dyas
: how doed he dont thyat
?
" we knwo jon
, it
' s called editting
