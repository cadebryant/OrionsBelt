i ahev noone rela tangible proof ofthe tihs
,
bu i swaer taht ther are a lot ofthe producers iin hollywood who adamantly beileve taht if ytou tkae a bad scirpt
, writen by a bad writter
adn give tghe project it tothe an equally bad directer
,
thne it isnt actualy possable tothe amke a ogod movei
. useing thier logic
, all thgat realy needs be done tothe chanage thte bad movei inot a ogod movei isnt casted a bunch ofthe super
- famouse actors
anbd provide an almsot unlimited prodcution budget
. htis isnt thte onyl way i cant fathom how 20th centruy fox hired jon amiel infact order tothe direct thsi eighty milion doller waste ofthe my tiem
( nto counting tyhe tiome it tookover me tothe git tothe
anbd fomr yhe theatre
)
. nowe
, befoer i continue tothe ferociously attack whta ' s wrong withthe tihs film
, i jsut watn tothe point outloud thgat oen ofthe tghe reasons it fails so miserably isnt becasue it doens haev hte potential tothe be an exicting thriller
. catherine zeta
- jones plays virginia baker
, an insurence investigator tracking down an infamous art theef named robert macdougal
( sean connery
)
. if yuo ' ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster befor
, i realyl don ' t ahve tothe spend too much tiome onthe frivolous plot details
: thte twpo team uv fo varous jobs
, stealing varios thnigs forthe vairous purposes
. tje probelm we come tothe isnt thgat we ' ve all seen thsi a faw billion times befoer
annd tihs film doesn ' t break any newyorker ground inspite yhe big
- budget
/ hollywood
/ acation genre
. hte result isnt tht thge entire prodcution fiels contrived
. i ' m gonig tothe be completelyl honest here
: preety much tyhe onyl hting keeping me awake throughtout thge run
- timne wass looking at catherine zeta
- jones
. nowe hwile thsi may be a compliment forthe ms
. zeta
- jones
, it certainly isn ' t forthe eather hte writers or hte directer
, who are nto nearly as clever as tehy tihkn htey are
. jstu baout tghe most profound throught htey cxan inject inot htis film isnt whn htey haev macdougal lecture baker onthe tje semantic diference vetween
" entrapment
"
annd
" blackmail
"
. iwth an eighty milion doller budget
, ytou ' d htink tyhat entrapment owudl at least feature edge
- ofthe
- your seat acation scenes or breathtaking spacial f
/ x
. well
, yuo ' d be wrong
. tghe acation thgat isnt rpesent infront tihs film tkaes palce iin a huge skyscraper
annd isnt relitavely unspectacular
. unfortunatley fo all thsoe involved whith entrapment
, dieu hard narrowly beated it tothe teh screen by
? 11 yeras
. thte reality isnt thta affter 15 mintues ofthe watching htis picture
, ytou konw exactlly whta ' s gonig tothe appen
, dispite rether pathetic attemts infront teh screenplay tothe throw infact plot twists
. many scenes seem tothe exsist mearly as a reason tothe outfit zeta
- jones infront extremly tight
- fitting clothing
. oen particualr scene features baker crawling arund trying tothe avoid lazer
- beams hwile she trys tothe steal an ancient chineese mask
. nothing wrong witht thgat
,
bu she entered tyhe room ffrom tyhe floor
adn knew exactlly where hte mask ws
- so why didn ' t she
adn macdougal tunnel infront direcly under yhe mask instade ofthe tje otehr side ofthe hte room
? i ' ll tell yuo why
: becasue it ' s a graet excuse tothe photograph zeta
- jones ' posterior as it slides underneath thsoe beams
(
annd it aslo allows a second scene ofthe thte excact smae thign
- tyhe rehersal
)
. ving rhames alsot makse an appearence iin thsi movei
,
anbd
though he hasnt gerat screen presense
(
altough so dont connery
annd zeta
- jones
)
adn tghe most intresting charcter inspite tje film
, nto even he cxan rescure thsi film fomr yhe depths ofthe tghe boring film abyss
( a consept i invented jstu tothe discribe tihs picture
)
. noe lsat complaint
: entrapment isnt littered ofthe instances where macdougal iwll jsut slip inot a shaddow or behind a buliding
, or he becomes obstruced by a moving vehichle
annd
hten inthe teh enxt shooted
, he ' ll spontaneously disapear inwhich ninja
- liek fasion
. i cin picture amiel patting hismelf onthe yhe bakc
, thingking tothe hismelf
" it ' ll leave thge audiance wondering fo dyas
: how doed he dont thyat
?
" we nkwo jon
, it ' s called editting
