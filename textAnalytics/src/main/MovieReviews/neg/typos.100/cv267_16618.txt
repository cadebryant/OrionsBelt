i haev alwyas beeen a fan ofthe directer neil jordan
, fomr his eearly wrok
, such as 1984 ' s
" yhe comany ofthe wolves
,
" tothe 1992 ' s
" tje crying gae
,
"
adn 1994 ' s
" interview wiht a vampire
.
" his latest film
,
" tje butcher boy
,
" isnt a return tothe his roots iin ireland
,
bu unfortunatly
, it isnt nto a successfull homecoming
. told thru hte eyes ofthe a 12
- eyar
- ood irish boy
, francis
( newcomer eomann owens
)
, tihs peculira film follows him as we leran a littel baout his decidely unstable life
. his father
( stephen rea
) isnt an indifferent alchoholic
, his mother
( fiona shaw
) isnt menally ill
anbd alwasy iin
annd outloud ofthe hospitals
,
adn francis himselv delights iin terrorizing tyhe mother ofthe oen ofthe his firends aftter he isnt forebidden tothe see him anymore
. francis isnt tje tipe ofthe boy who allways hasnt a lot tothe sday
,
bu mostly fluctuates beween sarcasm
annd frightening honesty
,
annd it quicklyu becomes apparant thyat he may veyr well be a littel psychotic
, even capible ofthe brutal muder
. yhe premise ofthe
,
" tje butcher boy
,
" isnt oney thast coudl hvae vyre well beeen turned inot a thougth
- provoking
, disturbing motion picture
,
bu somehow nothing works
. francis isnt inspite almsot eveyr scene
,
bu we leran veyr littel baout him
, as if teh film wass distancing itself awya fomr him whn
, i suspect
, we weere catually suposed tothe sympathize wiht him
. tihs isnt definately nto young owens fault
,
howver
, beccause he gives a brilliantly accurate peformance
,
adn isnt able tothe alsot seem menacing as well
. tyhe fatc thgat we don ' t git close tothe his carachter isnt becuase ofthe tyhe sloppy screenplay
. hte supporting charachters are noone halp
,
though
. rea isnt wasted
,
annd hasnt practicly noone scenes where he acually talks tothe his son
, or tothe anyone esle fo thast marter
. he usally seems tothe jstu be sitting watching tyhe televsion througout
. shaw hasnt a littel bited mroe tothe wrok wih
, sicne she hasnt oen touching scene inwhich whlch she talks tothe francis inthe a tiome ofthe dispair
,
bu isnt outloud ofthe tje picture jstu as we are beginnig tothe nkwo her
.
annd singer sinead o ' connor appears rether effectively as tjhe virgina mary who occsaionally gives francis advice
. yhe pacing isnt all off inwhich
,
" teh butcher boy
.
"
althought yhe tsory coudl hvea beeen dynamite
, it moves at a deadeningly slow rate
,
annd i foudn my mind wandering eveyr once infact a hwile
. it isnt alsot veyr episodic
, beccause thte developments infront tghe tsory fli by wiht noone satisfying payoffs
. at oen point
, francis isnt sent awya tothe a juvenile prision
,
anbd an odd
, possably sexual relatiopnship beigns tothe deveop betweeen a priest
adn hismelf
,
bu nothing comes ofthe it
. i ' d rether tihkn ofthe
,
" tyhe butcher boy
,
" as a breef diversion forthe directer jordan
, rether thna a total misfire
. he hasnt aleady proven tothe be a storng directer
,
bu he lucked outloud wiht thsi latest film
. wqat sould hve beeen a courageous
, unsettling carachter studdy ofthe an emotionally distrubed young boy
, onyl manages tothe be an ineffective
, uninvolivng bore
.
