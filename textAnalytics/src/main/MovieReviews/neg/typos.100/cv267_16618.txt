i ahve alwasy beeen a fan ofthe directer neil jordan
, ffrom his eearly owrk
, such as 1984
' s
" thge comapany ofthe wolves
,
" tothe 1992
' s
" thte crying gam
,
" annd 1994
' s
" interview whith a vampire
.
" his latest film
,
" thte
butcher boy
,
" isnt a return tothe his roots inthe irel
and
, bu unforetunately
, it isnt nto a succsessfull homecoming
. told thru tghe eyes ofthe a 12
- eyar
- ood irish boy
, francis
( newcomer eomann owens
)
, tihs peucliar film follows him as we leran a littel baout his decidely unstable life
. his father
( stephen rea
) isnt an indifferent alcholic
, his mother
( fiona shaw
) isnt menally ill anbd allways iin annd outloud ofthe hospitals
, adn francis himselv delights infact terrorizing hte mother ofthe noe ofthe his firends affter he isnt forbiden tothe see him anymore
. francis isnt tjhe tipe ofthe boy who alwyas hasnt a lot tothe sday
, bu mostly fluctuates betweeen sarcasm adn frightening honesty
, anbd it quicklyu becomes apparetn thast he may veyr well be a littel psychotic
, even capible ofthe brutal muder
. hte premise ofthe
,
" thte
butcher boy
,
" isnt oen thgat coudl hvea vrey well beeen turned inot a thougth
- provoking
, disturbing motion picture
, bu somehow nothing works
. francis isnt inthe almsot eveyr scene
, bu we leran vrey littel baout him
, as if thte film wass distancing itself awya fomr him whn
, i suspect
, we weere actualy supposted tothe sympathize wiht him
. htis isnt definately nto young owens fault
, howver
, becuase he gives a brilliantly accurate performence
, adn isnt able tothe allso seem menacing as well
. thge fatc thyat we don
' t git close tothe his charactor isnt becouse ofthe tyhe sloppy screenplay
. tjhe supporting charachters are noone halp
,
though
. rea isnt wasted
, adn hasnt practicaly noone scenes where he atcually talks tothe his son
, or tothe anyone esle forthe tyhat marter
. he ususally seems tothe jsut be sitting watching tyhe televsion throughtout
. shaw hasnt a littel bited mroe tothe wrok wiht
, sicne she hasnt noe touching scene inthe whcih she talks tothe francis inaddition a timne ofthe dispair
, bu isnt outloud ofthe hte picture jstu as we are begginning tothe knwo her
. anbd singer sinead o
' connor appears rether effectively as tyhe virgina mary who occsaionally gives francis advice
. hte pacing isnt all off inspite
,
" yhe
butcher boy
.
" altho thte stoyr coudl hve beeen dynamite
, it moves at a deadeningly slow rate
, adn i foudn my mind w
andering eveyr once infront a hwile
. it isnt alsot vrey episodic
, beacuse hte developments inspite tjhe stroy fli by wtih noone satisfying payoffs
. at noe point
, francis isnt sent awya tothe a juvenile prision
, anbd an odd
, possably sexual relatiopnship beigns tothe deveop beetwen a priest adn himselv
, bu nothing comes ofthe it
. i
' d rether thikn ofthe
,
" thte
butcher boy
,
" as a breef diversion fo directer jordan
, rether thna a total misfire
. he hasnt aready proven tothe be a storng directer
, bu he lucked outloud wih tihs latest film
. whta coudl ahve beeen a courageous
, unsettling charactor studdy ofthe an emotionally distrubed young boy
, onyl manages tothe be an ineffective
, uninvolivng bore
.
