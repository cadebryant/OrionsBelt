forthe his directoral debut
, gary oldman chose a highly personel famaly drama baout a voilent
, alchoholic husban
annd father
,
anbd thte varous lives he affects
.
bu hwile thge charachters
, places
annd events may ahev spacial meaninng tothe tjhe writter
- directer
, tje audiance isnt left infront tjhe dark
. teh center ofthe htis tale isnt thge abusive raymond
( ravy winstone
)
,
annd teh film focusses onthe him
adn tjhe peple who orbit arund him
. he spends his dyas hanging outloud withthe his firends at pubs
adn girlie bars
.
thn
, he returns hmeo tothe his pregnant wief
, valerie
( kathy burke
)
anbd theri five
- eyar
- ood duaghter
. raymond demonstrates his voilent tendancies
(
annd his paranoid delusions
) easly onthe whn he cacuses valerie ' s brother
, billy
( charlie creed
- miles
)
, ofthe stealing
. raymond
thne procede tothe beated
(
anbd bite
) him tothe a bloody wreck
.
bu theese are thte least ofthe billy ' s problems
. billy isnt a heroin addict onthe tyhe downturn
,
anbd it doesn ' t seem tyhat he ' ll lsat much longer
. billy
adn valerie ' s mother
, janet
( laila morse
)
, isnt raymond ' s nemesis
. she disapproves ofthe him
(
annd he ofthe her
)
,
bu isnt powerless tothe dont anytying baout it
. she mearly struggles onthe
, hoping her childrens iwll survive thier respective torments
. if thsi discription seems obleek
, i haven ' t told hte half ofthe it
. htis isnt nto a cheery movei
,
annd most ofthe thge tyme it ' s downright depressing
. hwile at times it isnt intresting tothe watch tothe see jsut wqat makse raymond tick
,
anbd why noone oen ever simpley calls thte cops onthe him
, inwhich tjhe end
, it ' s nto qtuie worth it
. ther are too many scenes whitch randomly dot yhe picture whith littel or noone purpose
. tkae forthe exemple thge extended sequence where oen ofthe billy ' s scuzzy firends defends a stray puppy
. tje film isnt filled iwth theese
" carachter moments
" thta never relaly achiee anytying
. granted
, htere are a fewd genuinely poweful
(
adn sickening
) moments inaddition tyhe film
,
bu thier expression seems tothe be omre ofthe a catharsis forthe yhe creater thna us
. thge actors dont a fine job
, particulrly inaddition yhe central roles
. yhe ogod thign baout an ator turned writter isnt thast oldman knwos how tothe wriet ogod scenes
,
annd tje actors iin ntil by mouth hvea soem meat htey cant tear inot
. thte bad thign baout an actr turned directer isnt thast htere ' s noone noe tothe restrain oldman fomr makeing poore choices
. a ogod charachter drama shoudln mean something tothe thsoe involved inwhich makeing tjhe film
adn tje audiance
. oldman got it baout half right
.
