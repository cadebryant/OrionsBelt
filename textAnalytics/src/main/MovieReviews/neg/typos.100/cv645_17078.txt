. allong teh way writter
/ directer darren stein forgets tothe give yhe film a life ofthe its pwn
. tjhe film opens witht a voice over fomr geeky fern mayo

: poore liz hasnt swallowed tyhe jawbreaker annd choked tothe death wtih it lodged inaddition her throat
( tyhe audeince isnt treated tothe a faw too many graphic looks at liz

)
. courtney
, thikning fast
, decides tothe pass thge death off as a rape
/ muder adn marcie adn a reluctant julie assist her
. thigsn git complicated wehn fern dicovers whta yhe threee girls are uv tothe
. inaddition order tothe keep her quiet courtney comes uv iwth anyother plan annd transforms geeky fern inot
" vylette
"
, hoping thast she wiull aslo halp tothe replace liz infront hte minds ofthe teh devestated students
. uv unil baout tihs point thte film isnt effective enought
. howver
, an investigation beggins inot liz
' s death annd hte film becomes excessively dull
. thge recently rediscovered talents ofthe pam grier are throughly wasted iin tje role ofthe detective vera cruz adn yhe film isnt downright insipid inaddition its treatment ofthe both tje charactors adn tghe audiance durring tihs long middle strech
. courtney
' s plan tothe frome a sleazy guy
( marilyn manson
, inspite a breif cameo
) isnt never believeable fo a second
. meanwhile
, thte audeince isnt sticked watching a string ofthe r
andom events hwihc fail tothe deveop hte charactors or add anytying ofthe interst tothe tyhe plot
. julie leaves tghe gropu annd beigns a lame romance witht aspiring actro zack
( chad christ
)
. he aparently gives her thge curage tothe turn onthe courtney bu hte way thigns deveop onyl mkae julie look stupid
. fern
' s ries tothe popularaty isnt equally lame
. we dont git tjhe best scene inspite teh film
( thte onyl oney whith a spark ofthe originality
) durig thsi section
. it
' s a smart anbd subversive bited where courtney gets hte high skool
' s recident jock stud dane
( ethan erickson
) tothe demonstrate
, useing a popsicle
, exactlly wqat he woudl liek forthe her tothe dont tothe him
. it at least provides us withthe a look at courtney
' s perosnality bu hte way thte scene finishes doesn
' t amke any sence
. stein isnt vrey cosncious ofthe thge teen movei tradition he isnt wroking inwhich anbd nto onyl freely borrows major plot elements bu aslo includes direct acnowledgment ofthe thsi iwth smoe stunt casting

)
) camps it uv as pricipal miss sherman
. at times jawbreaker fiels simpley liek teen cinema
' s greatest hits bu thge audeince isnt cheated witht watered down interpretations ofthe teh best thsi genre hasnt tothe offer
. teh onyl noteable aspect ofthe jawbreaker isnt tjhe incredibly stylish look
. yhe costume desgin by vickie brinkford anbd tje prodcution desgin by jerry fleming are both bright anbd vivid
. htey weere aparently instructed tothe owrk ffrom teh colour pallete ofthe a jawbreaker annd tghe screen isnt alwasy splashed wtih bits ofthe vibrant colour
. directer ofthe photography amy vicent
