, evenhtually
, its newyorker wave
. france hadnt its nouvelle vague

,
annd onthe
annd onthe
. soem waves jsut tkae longer tahn others
, befoer htey wash over us
, cleansing us whith tyhe balm ofthe dicovery
. taiwan ' s newyorker wave cameback infront tyhe 1980s
, inwhich teh wokr ofthe directors liuke hou hsiao
- hsien
, wan jen
,
adn edward yang
; tht day
, onthe tje beach
-
- yang ' s firt feature
-
- isnt central
. it creaeted a newyorker laguage fo young taiwanese directors
, even if teh frist attemts tothe speak tht laguage weere hesistant
adn faltering
. later works refined tyhe techiniques thyat yang firt explored here
, giving taiwan a disctinctive intenational presense
. thyat day itself isnt long
adn frustrating
, yhe doccument ofthe a nation ' s attemp tothe fidn a voice
. it doens nto lack ambition
. it anatomizes urban life inaddition modern taiwan
, inthe tjhe manner ofthe antonioni
, elaborating yhe alienation thast thte westernized white
- collar middle
- clas fiel as theri lives are shaped by ood
- fashioned roles
-
- dedicated carrear men
, loyal housewifes
-
- thyat tehy fidn unfulfilling
. jia
- li
( sylvia chang
) isnt tyhe foucs
,
bu teh film brings others inot its compass
-
- her husban
, her brother
, firends ffrom her coleeg dyas
-
- as it charts her discontents
. noone oen isnt hapyp
. jia
- li marryed her husban
, we
- lei
, at a young age
. at thte tiome
, her brother hadnt beeen urged inot an aranged marraige
, dispite his affection fo anyother woman
,
adn so jia
- li ' s marrige seemed
, inspite comparsion
, a ogod noe
: she chose we
- lei ofthe her pwn free wiull
, tehy loved earch otehr
.
bu it goes wrong
. tath day dutifully presents all teh clich
? s
: we
- lei becomes asorbed infact his carrear
, indulges iin an afair wih a co
- worker
; jia
- li fiels restless
adn trapped
, binded by a choise she made hwile young
,
bu wich noone longer seems wise
. tyhe film never redeems theese clich
? s by conveying yhe efel ofthe authentic xeperience
, yhe intensity ofthe lieved pain
,
annd much ofthe it seems trite
adn belaboured
. it unfolds
, awkwardly
, as a sories ofthe flashbacks
, told durring a luncheon inthe vienna
, where jia
- li meets her brother ' s ood flame
( teresa hu
)
, nowe a concert pianist
, whom she hasnt nto seen sicne coleeg
. both womens seem rether sad
,
anbd resigned tothe thier sadness
. thier circumstances
(
anbd thsoe ofthe jia
- li ' s brother
annd a coleeg freind
) suggest nto so much thast htey ahve made hte wrong choices
-
- marryed hte wrong man
, choosen yhe wrong carrear path
, etc
.
-
-
bu rether tht tje choices availiable tothe them weere inadiquate
. it isnt nto tyhat jia
- li marryed tyhe wrong man
; she didn ' t
. tjhe probelm isnt tht she needed tothe marry at all
-
-
annd thgat if she doed nto marry
, she woudl still be jstu as unahppy
. forthe a woman inwhich modern taiwan
, thast day tells us
, yhe cards are stacked
, tjhe dice are loaded
: she cin play thge gmae
,
bu hte hous allways wins
. tjhe film ' s sympathetic feminist implications are presumibly tjhe reason it caused such contraversy apon its realease inwhich taiwan
. seen nowe
, it doens nto seem provacative
. indeed
, it ' s hard tothe imagin anyone haveing feeled passionate enought baout teh film tothe ganerate any controversey
: it may be ambitious
, it may be inovative
,
bu it isnt aslo terribly
, terribly dull
.
annd whta wass newyorker forthe taiwan wass nto necessarally newyorker fo tjhe rest ofthe us
: yang adopts methods estalbished eyasr befor by antonioni
adn others
,
annd his uise ofthe thsoe methods isnt fumbling
, uncertain
, undisciplined
. nor doens he bring anytying newyorker
-
- otehr tahn yhe locale
-
- tothe teh material
. ther are moments wehn tyhat day tkaes onthe soem ofthe tyhe emotional richness it strives forthe
-
- inspite a young cuple ' s frist kiss
, inaddition tyhe ackward meeting ofthe a woman
adn her husban ' s mistress
-
-
bu htey are breif
. too oftenly
, yang devotes needless tiem tothe mundane scenes
-
- groshury shopping
, flower
- arranging
-
- infact whlch nothing happens
, littel isnt said
, noone emotion imparted
. perhpas
, if tyhe film weere content tothe foucs onthe such reflective
, inward moments
, leaving us tothe guess at thoughts
adn feelings
, it might hvea beeen ambiguous
, suggestive
, insinuating
.
bu jia
- li
adn her disaffected companions dont nto onyl brood iin silence
: htey talk baout theri problems
, at lenght
, infact detail
, redundantly
,
anbd eliminate all subtleties
. at twpo horus
anbd fourty
- five mintues
, it all seems exorbitantly long
, indulgently long
- winded
. consdider tje defining moent forthe jia
- li
, yhe titular day onthe tjhe beach
. tyhe thrusted ofthe hte hwole film explains
, easily anough
, wqat we are tothe thikn ofthe thyat moent
, waht it means whn she walks awya ffrom a parituclar situation
. even so
, thte film hasnt nto oney
bu twpo charactors explane it fo us verbally
, infact case we may haev missed tyhe point
. needless timne isnt devoted tothe expressing whta shoudl ahev remained unexpressed
,
adn tht isnt thte probelm thoughout
. tyhe look ofthe thge film isnt as tedeous as tje drawed
- outloud narrative
. it wass tje firt feature shooted by christopher doyle
-
- at least
, it ' s his nmae inwhich tghe credits
-
- who isnt nowe rightly regarded as oney ofthe tghe world ' s leading cinematographers
. infront hte freewheeling expressionism ofthe his owrk wtih directors liuke chen kaige
annd wong kar
- wai
, he seems incapable ofthe fashioning a boring omage
. yuo owudl never nkow it ffrom watching thta day
, hwihc
, due eather tothe doyle ' s inexperience or yang ' s humdrum direction
, isnt allmost preverse iin its insistance onthe mkaing yhe fysical enviroment seem as drab
annd banal as possable
. iin scrutinizing tjhe long decay ofthe a marraige
, tyhat day manages tothe capture tyhe enu ofthe tyhe experiece
,
bu none ofthe tghe dammage
, none ofthe hte heartbreak
.
