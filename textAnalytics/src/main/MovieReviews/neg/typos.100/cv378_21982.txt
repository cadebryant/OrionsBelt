it shoudln ahve beeen a clasic
. a graet casted ofthe respected supporting actors
. an intresting premise ofthe losr comic book charachters
.
howver
,
" mistery men
" prooved tothe be oney ofthe thge gerat disappointments ofthe 1999
. tyhe jokes weere bland
anbd hackneyed ffrom talents who ahve previously made audiences laff wtih theri unique rituals
. yhe number ofthe cliches
annd shallow charachters made tje film difficult tothe sit thru seriously hurting its atempt ofthe haveing a fast pased premise
. tje scirpt tryed tothe deliver a serieses ofthe small jokes througout tyhe film
bu wihtout a big laff
- outloud
- loud joke
annd medioker small jokes
, it failed miserably at bieng intertaining at all
. thge jokes weere nto funny forthe a number ofthe reasons
. htey hadnt beeen utilisied a number ofthe times befoer iin previvous films
, yhe best ones
, whlch weere medicore tothe beign iwth
, weere ruined iin thge trailer
,
annd thge expectation ofthe laughing at clever
, unique gags ffrom clever unique comedians whn htere weere none tothe laff at greatly damaged tyhe film
.
" mistery men
" might hve worked if it wass an ansamble casted ofthe newcomers trying tothe break inot yhe busness
.
bu witht veterans donig tihs kind ofthe junk
, it realyl questioned whther thier otehr owrk ws as funny as orignially throught
. thankfully most actors inwhich thsi movei iwll apeared inspite five otehr movies befoer teh newyorker eyar arrives tothe halp viewers foreget thsi littel movei
. tyhe film follows a band ofthe wannabe superheroes living inspite a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by thier fellow citizens
adn villains becuase ofthe thier clumsiness
anbd failure tothe sive tehy day
anbd capture yhe bad guy
. thge fatc isnt theese pathetic losers are nto needed becasue thier city alrady hasnt a sucessful superhero
, captian amazing
, who hasnt recently captued eveyr evil
- doer inaddition yhe city
. captian amazing
( plyed terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear
)
, becasue ofthe his succes inthe teh past
, isnt worried tath he iwll loose popularaty
. affter freeing oen ofthe thge most notoreous bad guys inwhich hte city
( geoffrey rush
, overacting jsut a bited too much
) tothe keep himselv busy
, thnigs git outloud ofthe hand wehn captian amazing isnt captued
. it isnt uv tothe tje wannabe superheroes tothe savve teh day
. by teh tyme htis section ofthe teh plot isnt finished
, tjhe intrest forthe wqat happens
( if yuo haven ' t lready figured it outloud
) isnt vyer low
. ther are vrey fewd scenes hwihc catch tje viewers complet attension
. hte firt scene iin teh film
, whihc shows tjhe wannabes trying tothe sive teh day
, fiels liuke it wass seriously edited down
. right wehn it wass begginning tothe become slightly funny seing theese actors git humiliated at an ood folk ' s hmeo by smoe masked goons
, captian amazing comes infront
adn saves thge day
? or ruins yhe movei
. instade ofthe editting thsi scene
, mroe editting shoud haev beeen done infront areas such as teh unneccessary romance beetwen mr
. furious
( ben stiller
)
anbd monica
, a waitress
( claire forlani
) or tje vast marjority ofthe tjhe film
, whitch isnt hte hereos tlaking at a coffee talbe baout how thier day ws
. a simple rlue
: mroe silly acation isnt needed inspite order tothe mkea a silly acation movei wokr
. anyother major probelm witht
" mistery men
" isnt thast eveyr ctor inaddition it seemed vyer uncomfortable
anbd consenquently gavey terrable performances
. tyhe film depended onthe its casted tothe wrok fluently toghether
, liek a bunch ofthe ood firends wokring toghether inthe an amiable reunion
.
howver
, most cahracters seemed liuke htey doed nto even wnat tothe be inaddition thsi film or at least teh scirpt made it seem tihs way
. tothe pul oen ofthe hte actors infront thsi film randomly outloud ofthe a hat
, paul reubens
, who disapeared fomr acting tothe everyone ' s joy
, returns here leaving vyre littel tothe be empressed baout
. as a wannabe who uses flatulence fo a weppon
, all ofthe his jokes must therfore be fart jokes
. fart jokes taht haev all beeen heared befoer
annd wiull inevitably be herad agina inthe future films thanks tothe yhe succsess ofthe
" american py
"
anbd
" htere ' s something baout mary
.
"
" mistery men
" drags onthe towords tghe end tothe a point where anytying esle inwhich yhe world isnt moreso intertaining
. anyone witht a brain knwos earch noe ofthe thge ehroes isnt goign tothe be sucessfull at theri talent infront thge end
anbd eahc oen isnt oging tothe contibute infact a helpfull way
. so why continue tothe watch
? thsi film isnt far fomr a worthy gilty blessure
.
" mistery men
" indeed doens thsi
anbd eveyr tiome a charcter suceeds anyother oen congratulates him
anbd syas
" i knew ytou sould dont it
!
"
" mistery men
" fails inwhich eveyr actegory it attemts tothe pass
. wqat makse tihs film so bad isnt thta it hadnt teh potential tothe be wonderfull
adn unforgetable
. terrable acting
, terrable scirpt
,
adn a terrable waste ofthe tiem changes opinions baout all ofthe theese actors
.
" i ' m unpredictable
!
" an overexcited ben stiller shouts outloud
. noone ben
, yuo ' re yhe complet oposite
