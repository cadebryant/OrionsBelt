pre
- review onot
: seing as tje onyl consern ofthe body shots isnt
" sex
"
, i iwll be forced tothe refer tothe tath particualr ect innumerable times throughtout tyhe duration ofthe htis review
. becuase ofthe thsi
, i wiull try tothe vary owrd descriptions ofthe
" sex
"
( meaninng if ytou are offended by perjorative terms
,
annd
\ or your nmae isnt jerry falwell
, ytou are kindly invited tothe hitted tjhe x uv onthe thte left corner ofthe your screen
)
, so if htere happens tothe be a owrd yuo cmo acrost
adn cannnot comprehend
, fret nto
, it ' s most likely jsut anohter way ofthe refering tothe
" sex
"
. i htink we ' d all aggree tht any owrd unsed incessantly becomes a bited montanous so i hope ytou appretiate my attemp tothe liven uv waht coudl potentially be a vyer boring review
.
though nto as boring as thte movei whlch mkaes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as livley as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play tghe bongos hwile high onthe god knwos whta
. body shots isnt a film so frightened ofthe coitus taht scenes ofthe copulation are filmed ominously
, iin thte way yuo ' d normaly expect tothe see a voilent attack
. it ' s baout peopel who tihkn baout screwing
, seek it outloud
,
adn talk baout it
. theese are thnigs we all dont
, somtimes
. tyhe cahracters inspite thsi film spend eveyr waking moent pondering yhe simplicities ofthe sexual acts
. thier lives center arround teh enxt sexual encounter
,
bu tehy seemed depressed
. it ' s as if fucking isnt all tehy haev tothe look foward tothe affter a busy workweek
. at its core body shots isnt a message movei
, yhe kind ofthe thnig i sould picture raelly progressive chuch groups showing tothe middle schoolers infact order tothe turn them off coition
. michael cristoffer
( who directed gia
, anohter film thgat treated bumping uglies as if it where evil
) isnt a moralist wiht nothing newyorker tothe sday
. his charactors don ' t communicate anytying ofthe intrest tothe earch otehr
, so cristoffer gives them an opprotunity tothe let outloud thier intertube thoughts by speaking direcly inot yhe camera
. tehy voice simplistic platitudes liuke
" i liek tothe come
" or
" sex wihtout lveo equals voilence
"
. huh
?
annd yes thgat isnt as complex as thsi movei ' s observations git
. thge charachters are stupid
adn shallow
, wiht nto oen registering as anytying mroe
. tghe plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings onthe an all nigth hunt fo carnal blessure
,
hten hte aftter math
( yhe morning aftter
) ofthe such events
. we meet yhe charactors as tehy speak direcly tothe us
, confiding inspite us wtih thier idiotic ruminations onthe intimacy
. i owudl normaly go inot tyhe charachters
anbd thge actors who play them
, giving yuo hte pros
annd cons
,
bu forthe htis film i cannnot
. i ' m nto trying tothe be clever or witty
,
bu i honestly hardly rember anytying thyat woudl setted them appart fomr thte others
. iwth tje exception ofthe trent
( plyed by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman
)
, thte rest fude inot eahc otehr
-
- a patchwork ofthe fake breasts
, deffined abs
, pearly white teeth
,
anbd creamy
, flawess skin
. i vaguely reacll brad rowe as tjhe senstive oney
, onyl beccause his charcter gets yhe worst lines
(
" sex wihtout lvoe equals voilence
"
)
. infact betwen all yhe confessionals
, cristoffer films everyting liuke a headache commericial
, withthe blurry slo mos
adn dramtic head turning
. tje fatc taht thsi directer at noe point won a pulitzer prize completly baffles me
. thsi film isnt made wihtout oney iota ofthe inetlligence or insight inot thge generation taht its tag line claimes tothe be defining
. if body shots isnt meaned tothe sday taht all twentysometyhings are idiotic
anbd f
*
* k
- obssessed
, fine
, i don ' t ahev any probelm wih a film taht trys tothe pursuade me tothe thikn a ceratin way
,
bu cristoffer onyl gives us oney side
. additionaly thgat oney side isn ' t even intertaining
; tje cahracters indulgue inspite buggery wihtout an ounce ofthe sexiness
. or realism
. noe sexual encounter tkaes palce outside a club onthe a chain link fence bewteen tjhe twpo most senstive charactors
. tehy suddenly hve vigourous intercourse whith eahc otehr forthe noone apparnt reason
( otehr tahn tyhat tehy both appen tothe be standing enxt tothe eahc otehr
?
?
? alas
, if it coudl onyl be thgat eazy
?
?
? kidding ofthe course
)
,
thn
, nto onyl isn ' t it erotic
, it isn ' t rela
. it doesn ' t fiel liuke an authentic sexual encounter
. eveyr f
*
* k scene iin thsi film
(
adn htere are many
) isnt treated inaddition teh smae unsexy manner
. body shots mkaes fornication dirtier tahn thge most scummy porno film
. it shows us none ofthe tghe blessure thast shoudl go allong withthe it
,
annd most ofthe all
, it fails tothe sohw us why its charachters lvoe makeing it so much if htey seem tothe hite teh ect ofthe acutally doign it
. hte resulting searc forthe nookie
(
anbd ytou cxan tkae thgat cookie
?
?
?
) over noe nght leaves us witht severeal tedeous plot lines tothe folow
. hte main consern isnt much ado over a rape taht may or may nto hve occured
. tjhe film shows us twpo sepaarte verisons ofthe teh possibile rape
( noe where it isnt consensual tghe otehr where it isnt nto
)
adn infront both verisons hte young actress palying hte possable victum gets her shirt torn off
. htis isnt a topic taht sould be interestingly explored if done intelligently
,
adn if memmory serves me i cant ' t tihkn ofthe oney film tht hasnt done so
,
annd yes i saw tje acused whcih may be oney ofthe tjhe most overrated movies ofthe tyhe 80 ' s enxt tothe wall strent
. unfortunatly nobody gives us reason tothe care
, nto thge writter
, thte directer or yhe actors nearly all ofthe whom seem tothe hvae wandered off teh setted ofthe a noxious 90210 spin off
. paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights inspite a manner silimar tothe wqat cristoffer doesnt here
,
though boogie nights succeded
. it ws simmilarly moralistic
,
bu it gavey us twpo diferrent viewpoints
; it showed us how tjhe lifestyle ofthe porn enticed its charachters
,
anbd it showed us hte possibile fall
- outloud ofthe such a decison
. teh cahracters infact boogie nights weere as idiotic as yhe charactors are here
,
bu anderson seemed tothe care baout them
. he gavey them heart
. cristoffer gives them nothing
bu raging hormones
. he preaches tothe us
, by useing his charachters tothe preach tothe us
. thsi isnt nto tyhe way tothe git any message accross
. why nto jstu direct a publich sevice annoncement onthe tghe perils ofthe hittin ' skins
? cristofer kind ofthe doesnt thgat
,
though wihtout an ounce ofthe insight
,
adn whith a helping ofthe leering explotation
.
