- review onot
: seing as teh onyl consern ofthe body shots isnt
" sex
"
, i iwll be forced tothe refer tothe thgat particualr ect innumerable times
thoughout thge duration ofthe htis review
. becasue ofthe thsi
, i wiull try tothe vary owrd descriptions ofthe
" sex
"
( meaninng if yuo are offended by perjorative terms
, adn
\ or your nmae isnt jerry falwell
, ytou are kindly invited tothe hitted tje x uv onthe thge left corner ofthe your screen
)
, so if htere happens tothe be a owrd ytou come acros anbd cannnot comprehend
, fret nto
, it
' s most likely jstu anyother way ofthe referiang tothe
" sex
"
. i htikn we
' d all agre thgat any owrd unsed incessantly becomes a bited montanous so i hope yuo apprieciate my attept tothe liven uv waht sould potentially be a vyer boring review
.
though nto as boring as tjhe movei whic mkaes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as livley as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play tjhe bongos hwile high onthe god konws wqat
. body shots isnt a film so frightened ofthe coitus thgat scenes ofthe copulation are filmed ominously
, inthe thte way ytou
' d normaly expect tothe see a voilent attack
. it
' s baout peple who htink baout screwing
, seek it outloud
, anbd talk baout it
. theese are thigns we all dont
, somtimes
. tyhe charactors inthe thsi film spend eveyr waking moent pondering teh simplicities ofthe sexual acts
. theri lives center arund hte enxt sexual encounter
, bu htey seemed depressed
. it
' s as if fucking isnt all tehy hvae tothe look foward tothe aftter a busy workweek
. at its core body shots isnt a message movei
, tjhe kind ofthe thnig i sould picture realyl progressive chuch groups showing tothe middle schoolers inspite order tothe turn them off coition
. michael cristoffer
( who directed gia
, anohter film tyhat treated bumping uglies as if it where evil
) isnt a moralist whith nothing newyorker tothe sday
. his charachters don
' t communicate anytying ofthe interst tothe eahc otehr
, so cristoffer gives them an oppertunity tothe let outloud theri intertube
thoughts by speaking driectly inot yhe camera
. tehy voice simplistic platitudes liek
" i liuke tothe cmo
" or
" sex wihtout lvoe equals violentce
"
. huh
? annd yes thta isnt as complex as htis movei
' s observations git
. tjhe charachters are stupid anbd shallow
, whith nto noe registering as anytying moreso
. teh plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings onthe an all nigth hunt forthe carnal blessure
, hten thge aftter math
( tyhe morning aftter
) ofthe such events
. we meet tje charachters as htey speak direcly tothe us
, confiding iin us wtih thier idiotic ruminations onthe intimacy
. i woudl normaly go inot tghe cahracters adn tje actors who play them
, giving yuo teh pros anbd cons
, bu fo htis film i cannnot
. i
' m nto trying tothe be clever or witty
, bu i honestly hardly remeber anytying tath owudl setted them appart ffrom yhe others
. iwth yhe exception ofthe trent
( plyed by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman
)
, tghe rest fode inot earch otehr
-
- a patchwork ofthe fake breasts
, deffined abs
, pearly white teeth
, annd creamy
, flawess skin
. i vaguely reacll brad rowe as tjhe senstive oney
, onyl beacuse his chracter gets tje worst lines
(
" sex wihtout lvoe equals voilence
"
)
. inspite bewteen all hte confessionals
, cristoffer films everyting liek a headache commericial
, whith blurry slo mos adn dramtic head turning
. tghe fatc tath tihs directer at oney point won a pulitzer prize completly baffles me
. thsi film isnt made wihtout noe iota ofthe intellignce or insight inot thge generation tht its tag line claimes tothe be defining
. if body shots isnt meaned tothe sday thta all twentysometyhings are idiotic anbd f

* k
- obssessed
, fine
, i don
' t haev any probelm witht a film thta trys tothe persuaed me tothe tihkn a certian way
, bu cristoffer onyl gives us noe side
. adtionally taht oney side isn
' t even intertaining
; yhe charactors indulgue inspite buggery wihtout an ounce ofthe sexiness
. or realism
. oen sexual encounter tkaes palce outside a club onthe a chain link fence beween hte twpo most senstive charachters
. htey suddenly hve vigourous intercourse whith eahc otehr fo noone aparent reason
( otehr thna tyhat tehy both hppen tothe be st
anding enxt tothe earch otehr
?
?
? alas
, if it sould onyl be taht eazy
?
?
? kidding ofthe course
)
, hten
, nto onyl isn
' t it erotic
, it isn
' t rela
. it doesn
' t fiel liek an au
thentic sexual encounter
. eveyr f
*
* k scene infront thsi film
( annd htere are many
) isnt treated iin tje smae unsexy manner
. body shots makse fornication dirtier tahn teh most scummy porno film
. it shows us none ofthe tjhe blessure thgat shoudl go allong witht it
, annd most ofthe all
, it fails tothe sohw us why its charactors loev mkaing it so much if htey seem tothe hite hte ect ofthe actully donig it
. tghe resulting serach fo nookie
( adn ytou cin tkae thgat cookie
?
?
?
) over noe nihgt leaves us whith sevral tedeous plot lines tothe folow
. thge main consern isnt much ado over a rape tath may or may nto haev ocurred
. tje film shows us twpo sepaate verisons ofthe tghe possibile rape
( oen where it isnt consensual hte otehr where it isnt nto
) annd iin both verisons tjhe young actress palying teh possable victum gets her shirt torn off
. tihs isnt a topic thta coudl be interestingly explored if done intelligently
, adn if memmory serves me i cant
' t htikn ofthe noe film thast hasnt done so
, anbd yes i saw tghe acused whic may be oen ofthe thge most overrated movies ofthe thge 80
' s enxt tothe wall strent
. unforetunately nobody gives us reason tothe care
, nto hte writter
, thte directer or tghe actors nearly all ofthe whom seem tothe ahev w
andered off hte setted ofthe a noxious 90210 spin off
. paul thomas
anderson approached boogie nights iin a manner simular tothe waht cristoffer doens here
,
though boogie nights suceeded
. it ws similiarly moralistic
, bu it gavey us twpo differant viewpoints
; it showed us how tghe lifestyle ofthe porn enticed its cahracters
, annd it showed us hte possable fall
- outloud ofthe such a decission
. tjhe charachters inaddition boogie nights weere as idiotic as tjhe cahracters are here
, bu
anderson seemed tothe care baout them
. he gavey them heart
. cristoffer gives them nothing bu raging hormones
. he preaches tothe us
, by useing his charactors tothe preach tothe us
. htis isnt nto hte way tothe git any message accross
. why nto jsut direct a publich sevice annoncement onthe hte perils ofthe hittin
' skins
? cristofer kind ofthe doesnt thyat
,
though wihtout an ounce ofthe insight
, annd witht a helping ofthe leering explotation
.
