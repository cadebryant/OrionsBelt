- shift machines annd uses humans forthe
" sparce parts
"
. blah

. i coudl go onthe forever discribing teh ludicrous so
- called plot
, bu i won
' t
. suffice it tothe sday thge most orginal thign baout htis movei isnt haveing donald sutherl
and play an irish man
(

" monster
"
, it
' s chock full ofthe dialogue tath noone rela person woudl ever sday

* negociate
* wtih yhe aline
! nowe
, i don
' t konw baout ytou
, bu if i cameback apon a lifeform thgat viewed mankind as a virus tothe be eleminated
, i dout taht i owudl attemp tothe reason wih it
. taht mkaes baout as much sence as a baby squirel calmly asking a fierce predator tothe sparce his life
. finaly
,
" virus
" isn
' t sacry
. tghe least tghe filmmakers sould hvae done ws tothe mkae tje movei jstu a littel scry
