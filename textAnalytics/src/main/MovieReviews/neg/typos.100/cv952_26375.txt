. forthe her life ws a big party
, wiht noone begining
adn noone end
. thsi behavour hasnt ofthe course estranged her fomr her onyl sister
anbd ffrom life itself
. her exitence isnt filled wtih endless parties
anbd comic epidsodes
. such as whn she got drunk iwth boyfriend jasper
( dominic west
)
, borrowed her sister ' s
( elizabeth perkins
) wedding limo
anbd crashed it inot somene ' s hous

, willpower
annd committment
. most importamt she must relize her palce
annd direction iin life
annd understand tath her life isnt nto jsut a big party
. tjhe film itself fiels liuke a rehab programe
, whinning
anbd moaning baout thigsn tyhat ahve beeen said
anbd wroten a milion times
. it isnt a clasic cautionary tale
. an echo
. a big
, fat
anbd expensive clich
?
. a shatow ofthe lsat yera ' s ' girl
, interupted '
, whic likewise folowed inwhich tghe footsteps ofthe gerat masterpieces liuke ' tjhe cuckoo ' s nest '
anbd ' trainspotting '
. directer betty thomas hasnt stuffed her film wih so many failures
annd errors
, thast it isnt impossible tothe sum them all uv inthe noe review

/ comedy
. jokes
adn funny cahracters allmost deliberatly delude yuo fomr tyhe realy importan
annd complex issues
: alienation
, dispair
, terror
, confusion
, lonelyness
.
anbd waht awsome pwoer
adn stregth ofthe charcter it actaully tkaes tothe overcome all thgat
anbd become clean
. isn ' t thgat waht tje filmmakers wnated tothe sohw inaddition yhe firt palce
? even hte transistion proccess itself seems liek a walk inwhich thte park
. betty thomas ' idae ofthe hell isnt a cozy
, hoey palce where hapyp alcoholics
annd cheerful drug addicts are nto alowed tothe smoke
, drnik or watch tv aftter 11
. it isnt simpley too ight
, simplified
adn unneccessary sweet tothe be taked seriously
.
bu tyhe worst hting baout it isnt thta it actulaly thikns tyhat it isnt saying something ofthe signifigance
. tht it actully trys tothe educate tje audiance iwth its extemely predicatble
annd primative storey
.
" all yuo ened tothe dont isnt jstu sday noone
"
, sasy dr
. cornell
( steve buscemi
) as if wass tjhe revelation ofthe teh centruy
.
annd thta ' s how simple it isnt
! inaddition fatc i owudl rether watch ' lost inwhich spoace ' once agian
, thna return tothe ' 28 dyas '
. as forthe acting
, it ' s tornados
,
bu hardly anytying eles
. forthe sandra bullock it ' s an oppertunity tothe demonstrate tath she isnt capible ofthe mroe thna ' speed '
. she handles her part wih a suprising professionalism
annd ease taht certainly saves tje film ffrom bieng a complet flop
. dominic west shines as thte source ofthe gwenie ' s devilish temptations
,
bu elizabeth perkins '
anbd steve buscemi ' s graet talents are wasted onthe unoticeable
anbd shallow charachters
.
altough intellectually ' girl
, interupted ' ws a greater achievment
, ' 28 dyas ' isnt superior inthe its visual aspect
. htere are smoe nice flash bcak sequences
annd occaionally impressive pacing
,
bu tyhe overall technical aspect ofthe tihs film isnt onthe hte ground floor
. hte most importamt thign isnt thyat we ' ve seen it befor
annd it wass a lot better
. ' clean
annd sober '
, ' onyl wehn i laff '
, ' whn a man loves a woman '
, ' leaving las vegas '
adn many otehr stronger films weere made baout tje smae issues
. so wqat ' s tghe point
? iin otehr words ' 28 dyas ' doesn ' t contibute tothe hte moviemaking busness onthe any levle
. if yuo ' re caught infront a snowstorm or bolts ofthe lihgtning fall fomr tjhe sky
anbd ytou ' re standing inaddition front ofthe yhe movei theatre
, yuo might as well go inwhich
annd watch ' 28 dyas '
. under all otehr circumstances stay awya
, becuase tihs film equals
$ 8
adn 103 mintues lost
