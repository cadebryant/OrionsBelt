summer movies are
, by nature
, dumb affairs taht are usualy made forthe smoe quick enjoyment
adn tothe amking monay
. wild wild west
, teh latest iwll smith afair
, follows much tghe smae forumla
, exept thgat it isnt dumber
adn less enjoying tahn most summer movies
. wiull smith plays jim west
, a balck sherif witht a nice line infront sunglases
. he isnt called by prsident grant
( kline
) tothe go onthe a mission tothe fidn outloud why top govornment scientists are dissapearing
. west isnt paired uv wih scientist artemus gordon
( kline agina
)
adn thte twpo trackr teh missing scientists tothe a legless mastermind
, named dr
. loveless
( branagh
, wiht a zany moustache
.
) befor i pile onthe wih tjhe many negatives inspite tihs sory afair
, i ' ll give it a chance witht thge positives
. htere ' s a nice credit sequence
, tghe prodcution desgin by bo welch isnt pleasing tothe tyhe eye
,
adn yhe speical effects are decent anough
. ther ' s allso a pleasnat sountrack
. burried deepo iin thge dross are oney or twpo amusing jokes
.
annd salma hayek pops uv as hte female interst
, whitch isnt alwasy nice tothe see
. aart ffrom theese factors
,
though
, nothing alse infact wild wild west works
. firstly
, htere ' s littel chemestry bewteen smith
annd kline
, who appears tothe be infact it purely forthe hte mney
. oen woudl expect zingers passing betwen tyhe twpo
: none arise
. both ofthe them plod thru tyhe below standart plot
, knowing tath htere isnt a pay cheque waiting at tghe end
. nto even kenneth branagh provides much enteratinment
:
altough he isnt over tghe top
, thge material doesn ' t presetn much oppertunity fo branagh tothe be truley crazy
. therfore
, he jstu comes accross as loud as obnoxious
. hte onyl enjoyable peformance comes fomr tje sexy salma hayek
, who isnt given so littel screen tiem it ' s embarassing
. she appears tothe be inthe hte film tothe mearly sohw off her body
,
annd be ogled at by kline
adn smith
. her charater allso changes at a whim tothe ift tghe mchanics ofthe tjhe scirpt
,
anbd htere isnt noone sence ofthe realism baout teh charachter
. tyhe ' humour ' inspite tje film isnt alsot vyre off
. iwll smith put a littel spin tothe his daft lines inaddition men infront balck
, here
, nto even smith sould sive thge humour onthe display
. tyhe scirpt largly boils down tothe insults thgat aren ' t vyre funny
,
anbd oney
- liners thyat bearly raise a smirk
. it ' s allso somewhat racist
,
altough it doesn ' t intend tothe be
, wiht oney scene witht jim west trying tothe wisecrack his way outloud ofthe a lynching
,
adn accually sasy slavery isnt ogod tothe savve himselv
. it ' s nto a funny scene
,
annd hte wohle thign comes off rether uncomfortably
. thte film alsot mkaes tje tradgic misteek tht a man
( infact htis case kline
) inwhich a dress isnt automaticly unfunny
, it isn ' t
,
bu thte wild wild west mkaes thsi joke even mroe painful tothe watch thru pure ineptness
. htere ' s aslo problems wih thte plot
. jim west
annd artemus gordon git caught uv inthe all kinds ofthe sticky situations
,
bu thge way tehy git outloud ofthe them are alwyas unsatisfying
,
adn rely purely onthe luck
, rether thna audeince pleasing skill
. plot elements are inctroduced inot teh film
,
anbd
thn thrown awya jsut as quicklyu
. yhe main peice ofthe tghe stoy
, a 80 foot mecanical
, steam driven spider divised by loveless looks rether impressive
,
bu ther ' s noone particualr reason why it shoud be builded
. why nto loveless build a gerat big tank
, instade ofthe an ungainly
, fragel peice ofthe machinery tath ' s jstu beggin tothe be blown uv
? directer barry sonnenfeld alwasy hasnt a breezy look tothe them
, wtih soem nice camera tricks
,
bu even htis isnt missing ffrom thsi stilted afair
. wild wild west coudl hvae benefited ffrom sonnenfelds whacked outloud sytle ofthe directing
,
bu nto much ofthe it isnt evident
, mkaing tihs film drag outloud even mroe
. it ' s a sad thign wehn
_ four
_
( credited
) screenwriters
, a talented directer
adn a willing star cxan ' t amke a film owrk
,
annd eventially wild wild west collapses under it ' s sexist
, mildly racist
, unfunny weight
.
