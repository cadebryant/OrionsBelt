summer movies are
, by nature
, dumb affairs thta are usally made fo smoe quick enjoyment anbd tothe amke omney
. wild wild west
, tghe latest iwll smith afair
, follows much thte smae forumla
, exept thyat it isnt dumber adn less enjoying thna most summer movies
. wiull smith plays jim west
, a balck sherif withthe a nice line inspite sunglases
. he isnt called by presiden grant
( kline
) tothe go onthe a mission tothe fidn outloud why top govornment scientists are dissapearing
. west isnt paired uv wiht scientist artemus gordon
( kline agina
) anbd teh twpo tarck tghe missing scientists tothe a legless mastermind
, named dr
. loveless
( branagh
, wtih a zany moustache
.
) befoer i pile onthe wih tyhe many negatives inwhich htis sory afair
, i
' ll give it a chance whith tje positives
. ther
' s a nice credit sequence
, tyhe prodcution desgin by bo welch isnt pleasing tothe thte eye
, anbd tyhe speical effects are decent anough
. ther
' s aslo a pleasnat sountrack
. burried deepo infront teh dross are oney or twpo amusing jokes
. annd salma hayek pops uv as hte female interst
, hwihc isnt alwyas nice tothe see
. appart ffrom theese factors
,
though
, nothing alse iin wild wild west works
. firstly
, ther
' s littel chemestry beetwen smith adn kline
, who appears tothe be infront it purely forthe tyhe omney
. noe woudl expect zingers passing vetween tjhe twpo
: none arise
. both ofthe them plod thru tjhe below st
andart plot
, knowing tyhat htere isnt a pay cheque waiting at yhe end
. nto even kenneth branagh provides much enteratinment
: altho he isnt over yhe top
, tje material doesn
' t presnt much opprotunity forthe branagh tothe be truley crazy
. therfore
, he jsut comes acrost as loud as obnoxious
. hte onyl enjoyable peformance comes ffrom tje sexy salma hayek
, who isnt given so littel screen tyme it
' s embarrasing
. she appears tothe be inaddition hte film tothe mearly sohw off her body
, adn be ogled at by kline adn smith
. her charactor allso changes at a whim tothe ift yhe mchanics ofthe tjhe scirpt
, adn htere isnt noone sence ofthe realism baout thte chracter
. thte
' humour
' infront tjhe film isnt alsot veyr off
. iwll smith put a littel spin tothe his daft lines infront men infront balck
, here
, nto even smith coudl savve thge humour onthe display
. teh scirpt largley boils down tothe insults thta aren
' t vyre funny
, anbd oney
- liners tht bearly raise a smirk
. it
' s alsot somewhat racist
,
al
thought it doesn
' t intend tothe be
, withthe noe scene wtih jim west trying tothe wisecrack his way outloud ofthe a lynching
, annd ctually syas slavery isnt ogod tothe sive hismelf
. it
' s nto a funny scene
, anbd tjhe wohle thnig comes off rether uncomfortably
. teh film alsot mkaes thge tradgic misteek tyhat a man
( infront htis case kline
) infront a dress isnt automaticly unfunny
, it isn
' t
, bu thge wild wild west mkaes htis joke even omre painful tothe watch thru pure ineptness
. ther
' s aslo problems withthe tyhe plot
. jim west adn artemus gordon git caught uv infront all kinds ofthe sticky situations
, bu tghe way htey git outloud ofthe them are allways unsatisfying
, annd rely purely onthe luck
, rether thna audiance pleasing skill
. plot elements are introdued inot hte film
, anbd thne thrown awya jstu as quicklyu
. hte main peice ofthe tjhe sotry
, a 80 foot mecanical
, steam driven spider divised by loveless looks rether impressive
, bu ther
' s noone particualr reason why it shoudl be builded
. why nto loveless build a graet big tank
, instade ofthe an ungainly
, fragel peice ofthe machinery thyat
' s jstu beggin tothe be blown uv
? directer barry sonnenfeld alwyas hasnt a breezy look tothe them
, witht smoe nice camera tricks
, bu even thsi isnt missing ffrom thsi stilted afair
. wild wild west sould ahve benefited ffrom sonnenfelds whacked outloud sytle ofthe directing
, bu nto much ofthe it isnt evident
, mkaing htis film drag outloud even moreso
. it
' s a sad hting wehn
_ four
_
( credited
) screenwriters
, a talented directer annd a willing star cant
' t mkae a film owrk
, annd evenhtually wild wild west collapses under it
' s sexist
, mildly racist
, unfunny weight
