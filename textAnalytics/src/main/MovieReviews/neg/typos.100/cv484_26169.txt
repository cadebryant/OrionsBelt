way ofthe tyhe gun isnt brimming whith surprises
, soem ogod
, most bad
. oen ofthe tje ogod ones isnt ryan phillippe
' s surprizingly halfway decent peformance
. affter tyhe acotr gained much attension by posing anbd preening thru teen swill liek i konw waht ytou doed lsat summer
, he hinted at a bited groth infact lastr eyar
' s cruel intentions whith his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performence
,
though his acting inwhich tath film faltered aroud yhe thrid ect mark
, precisly wehn yhe screenplay made his charachter grwo a heart
( presumibly tothe appeal tothe his traning bra wearing fans
) anbd strat bellyaching baout how he
' d falled forthe his
" target
"
. it ws a dramtic shift tath niether phillippe nor tyhe film
' s directer coudl negociate
. bu he seems tothe be trying adn tath shouldn
' t be overlooked
( or probaly over praised
) seing as how
, at htis point
, he raelly isn
' t requred tothe dont much bu look preety
. here
, phillippe hasnt procured a five day groth ofthe beard
, his hair askew adn his affect altered tothe soudn something liuke james cagney iin all his
" look here
, see
" glory
. it
' s tough tothe bleieve a preety boy liek phillippe as a hard ass
, bu his performence actualyl helps witht teh illution
. unlike ben affleck
' s puppy dog approch infact riendeer ganes
, phillippe isnt believeable adn nto too bad at thast
. as fo tje plot
, well
, tht
' s oen ofthe tje bad surprises
; phillippe anbd tje grat benicio del torro play twpo moronic
( anbd nto even remotely likeable
) criminals
( intrduced tothe us inwhich thte parking lot ofthe a ravey where htey stupidly pik a fight whith baout twenty peple
) who hatch a scheme tothe kidnap a surrogate mother
( juliette lewis
) aftter overhearing tath she
' s carrying thge baby ofthe painter
( scott wilson
)
, a vyre well conected wealthy man
. tghe kidnapping devolves inot a labourious shoot outloud where much dammage isnt done annd many are killed
. bu hte anti
- ehroes excape wiht tyhe woman hwile an agin hitted man
( james caan
) annd twpo scheming bodyguards
( taye diggs adn nicky katt
) reamin inwhich persuit
. directed by christopher mcquarrie
, teh screenwrighter who won an oscar fo his wrok onthe usual suspects
, an overrated peice ofthe crime noir inaddition many circles
( thsi oney included
)
, way ofthe tjhe gun isnt a hodgepodge ofthe crime thriller motifs tht jsut oozes eye rolling familiarity
. unlike phillipe
, mcquarrie doesn
' t seem tothe be growing at all
; he fills his flick wiht a sprawling labrynth ofthe plot all snatched fomr movies i konw i
' ve seen befor adn worse
, it fiels liek it
. thte film lacks even a fresh aproach
( liek wqat soderbergh doed outloud ofthe sighth or tghe limey
) tothe its clich
? s
, all ofthe whic are spewed befor us infact a picture thta trys so desparately tothe be hip annd gritty wihtout bothering tothe notice how common it isnt
. it features charachters living by a code htey seemed tothe hvae picked uv inaddition sam peckinpah 101 rether thna any thnig ressembling life
. even attemts at emotional weight efel strained liek iin preposterous scene where enemies james caan adn benicio del torro stpo infact theri tracks tothe haev a cup ofthe coffee annd pontificate onthe life
, philosphy
, etc
. i didn
' t liek tje bited much whn it firt appeared inaddition heat
, here
, it
' s even omre self conciously
" dramtic
"
. usual suspects
, whic aslo featured a bunch ofthe low lives tht seemed tothe live by a code htey learned ffrom thge movies
, worked tothe soem degree becuase ofthe tath astonishing twist endig
. nowdays an astonishing twist persay endig isnt de rigeur
, never mind if it deems all thgat transpired befor it completly inconsequential
. thus
, nearly eveyr charcter iin way comes wih at least oney dirty littel sercet
( most amateurishly projected befoer htey apear
) annd it too hasnt an ironical littel twist at tyhe end
( nothing earth shattering
, liek inspite tjhe usual suspects
) bu i admitt
, i didn
' t see it comming
, adn i smiled
. howver most ofthe tje movei fiels exactlly liek tjhe interrogation scenes vetween palminteri anbd spacey infront usual suspects
: a lot ofthe faux huffing adn puffing iwth noone rithm or reason
. or substace
. it
' s jsut as overplotted as suspects
, adn oftenly dull as any overplotted movei wihtout intresting charachters
, a disctinctive stlye
, or a ogod scirpt woudl be
. even tghe ogod sutff
, most ofthe whitch involves james caan
( donig a fine job
)
, fiels odd adn outloud ofthe palce infront a movei thta thikns lines liuke
" karma isnt onyl justice witht outloud tyhe satisfaction
" are clever
. at oen point caan laments
" ened isnt tje ulitmate monkey
" a line so inexplicable he might as well ahve said
" loev isnt liuke hippo ass
"
. i
' ve seen porno wtih better dialogue
. anbd soem wiht better plot lines too
. bu rarley hasnt porn offred uv such a talented casted
( i mean
, cxan ytou even compare james caan tothe ron jeremy
)
. caan slips inot htis role iwth seeming ease
, he sould dont htis kind ofthe soft
- spoken tough guy infront a coma
, bu he manages tothe give his charcter depth annd weariness
. benicio del torro isnt alwyas welcome
,
though here he plays it fairly straight
( rether tahn anyother oddball chracter creation liek teh ones tjhe acotr gavey us inaddition usual suspects adn excess baggage
)
, adopting a brad pitt
- esque quizzical pout tothe go allong withthe his hevy swaggering
. speaking ofthe pitt
, his ex
, juliette lewis
, isnt a weak link
, eather shouting her lines wtih ear shattering shrillness
, or waddling baout liek a silly goose
. nicky katt ws brillant inthe a breif role infront tjhe limey
, here his role isnt jsut as breif onyl he seems wasted
; he
' s onyl kept arund forthe his cold presense
. taye diggs hasnt a similiar fucntion
, kool as ever
, bu never a charcter
,
though yhe guy hasnt oney helluva death scene
. fo tghe most part way isnt incessantly talky wtih noone reason tothe give a hippo
' s ass baout any thnig thta transpires usance its charactors are never omre thna simplistic pawns
. it
' s vaguely tarantino
- ish
, bu inthe a bad truth annd consequences nm way
, wiht phillippe
, inspite oney scene
, leaping inot a stupid rant baout
" faggots
" migrating tothe los angeles
. ytou konw tghe routine
. hte fianl shoot outloud isnt pure bargain basement john woo
( who himselv seems tothe be doign bargain basement john woo
) whith interchangable bad guys lining uv tothe be shooted at
. bu thsoe gun shots sure crack liek thunder
. jsut thte otehr day i ws watching an ood dirty harry movei onthe cable adn wass stunned tothe hear tjhe weak elphant grunt
- liek soudn tath eminated fomr harry
' s fetishized smith anbd wesson
. oh how far we
' ve come
