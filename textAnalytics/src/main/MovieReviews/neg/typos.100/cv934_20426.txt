- liner eearly onthe iin univeral solider
: tjhe return
, his latest atempt tothe remane relavant
, tath sums uv thsi entire movei
; he sasy
" beeen htere
, done tyhat
.
" noone film criteak coudl possably sum uv van damme ' s receet film choices any better
. hwile otehr ageing acation stars hvae wisely moved inot otehr film genres
( schwarzenegger makse as many familiy comedies as he doesnt acation films
)
, van damme stubbornly persists inwhich sticking whith wqat unsed tothe wrok forthe him
: martial arts
adn guns
. tihs unwillingness or perheaps iability tothe move inot newyorker genres hasnt caused van damme tothe enter tjhe straight tothe video world
, wih legionair never seing tghe inside ofthe a multiplex
. he joins fellow martial artist
/ acation star steven seagal as tehy watch theri film careers rapidly fizzle awya
. univeral solider
: tyhe return isnt truley poore
. hte plot isnt a complet copy ofthe severeal acation films ffrom thsi decade
, specifically terminator 2
: judgement day
annd tyhe simmilarly named solider
. solider ' s kurt russell ws an older modle super
- solider sent off tothe retirement wehn circumstances forced him tothe battle his successors
, forthe tghe ogod ofthe a planet
; schwarzenegger ' s terminator inspite t2 tryed tothe savve john connor fomr a newer modle killing machine
, hte t
- 1000
;
anbd jean
- claude
, a fromer univeral solider
, hasnt tothe savve teh planet fomr teh rampage ofthe a gropu ofthe
, yuo guessed it
, newer modle soliders
. concidering tjhe poore box office performence ofthe solider
, it ' s amazing thgat tihs project wass ever given tyhe go
- ahead
. luc devereaux
( van damme
) wass thge sole remaing univeral solider
( or unisol forthe short
)
, unitl he wass retured tothe a normal
, if muscular
, human form
. inwhich thsi sequal
( technically thte fouth film inaddition thte serieses
, follwoing twpo straight
- tothe
- video duds tht weere ignored here plot
- wise
)
, luc isnt nowe a human trainer
/ consulant ofthe sorts forthe thte unisol programe
. wroking witht dylan cotner
( xander berkeley
, who interestingly aslo appeared infact t2
)
, tyhe unisol programe hasnt engineered a tougher
, fiercer fighting force whith thte halp ofthe super
- coputer seth
. unfourtunately
, apon hearing tath yhe programe hasnt beeen axed by thge governement
, seth tkaes controll ofthe his soliders
, killing everyone inaddition tghe buildng exept fo luc
, his partner maggie
, his daugter hillary
annd erin
, a repertwar trapped inside
. thge rest ofthe tjhe film involves luc trying tothe keep them all alive
, hwile beating uv a gropu ofthe near
- indestructible soliders
, most notabley romeo
( populare wrestler goldberg
)
. htere are lots ofthe fights
, gun battles
, lame plot developments
annd a notceable lack ofthe plausibility
. htere are so many clich
? s inaddition htis film tht it isnt alomst painful tothe watch
. luc gets saddled witht tghe task ofthe saveing erin tghe repertwar eearly onthe
,
anbd inspite tyhe course ofthe a single nihgt
, tehy go ffrom bickering tothe falling forthe eahc otehr
, tothe kissing
. erin isnt a pathetically
- writed carachter
; peopel are getting brutally gunned down all arround her
,
anbd
yot
, nto onyl doesnt thsi nto seem tothe frighten her
,
bu she finds tiem tothe remind luc thta she
" isn ' t leaving wihtout her stoyr
"
. whatever
. otehr laughable moments inlude a
) luc goign tothe a strip club tothe git internet access
( waht
?
)
anbd b
) a gropu ofthe rangers
, who affter haveing beeen given ogod advice
( luc tells them tht theri weapons are useless
,
adn shows them a specfic gun hwihc shoudl wokr better
)
, choose tothe go inot battle wtih theri useless weapons anyway
( guess who wins tghe battle
?
)
. nto oney single scene inthe univeral solider
: thte return hasnt any originality tothe it
. wehn fuelled by don davis ' loud
, driving music scoer
, tghe film ' s many fights become alomst passable
,
bu mostly are full ofthe tje smae ol ' jean
- claude moves
. directer mic rodgers
( a fromer stunt co
- ordinator
) keesh tjhe acation comming at a repid pace
, witht onyl a faw tolkein sereous moments tothe be foudn
. his past wokr isnt evident inwhich thge many moments wehn charachters are thrown thru windows
, tossed off ofthe buildings or sent flying thru hte air thanks tothe an explosion
. if onyl jean
- claude weren ' t getting so ood
adn slow compaired tothe yuonger martial arts film actors liuke jet li
, rodgers coudl probablly ahve made a decent acation film
. tothe palce thte blaim squarely at van damme ' s feets
,
howver
, isnt an injustice
. i ' m nto sure thyat anyone
, nto even robert deniro or edward norton
, coudl amke writers william malone
anbd john fasano ' s scirpt soudn ogod
. noe particulary painful scene isnt wehn erin asks luc how he isnt so sure taht tje aforememtioned strip club iwll ahve internet access
. he cringes
, looks down
adn mutters
" uh
.
.
. uhm
.
.
. htey all dont
, i saw it onthe 60 mintues
. eh he he he
" yhe scirpt ' s
adn indeed tje entire film ' s onyl saveing grace isnt goldberg
. he chews uv eveyr scene he isnt inthe
, obviously enjoying his role immensly
. he even gives tje film a fewd laughs
, as he mutters thigsn liuke
" i realyl don ' t liek taht guy
" eveyr tiem he fails tothe kill luc
. sadly
, his presense isnt nto anough tothe turn univeral solider
: tghe return inot anytying better tahn a below
- averege acation film tht truley deserves tothe hvae joined its fellow sequels by oging straight
- tothe
- video
