" noone film criteak coudl possably sum uv van damme
' s receet film choices any better
. hwile otehr ageing acation stars hve wisely moved inot otehr film genres
( schwarzenegger makse as many famaly comedies as he doesnt acation films
)
, van damme stubbornly persists inaddition sticking wtih waht utilisied tothe owrk fo him
: martial arts adn guns
. htis unwillingness or perheaps iability tothe move inot newyorker genres hasnt caused van damme tothe enter yhe straight tothe video world
, iwth legionair never seing tyhe inside ofthe a multiplex
. he joins fellow martial artist
/ acation star steven seagal as tehy watch thier film careers rapidly fizzle awya
. univeral solider
: thge return isnt truley poore
. hte plot isnt a complet copy ofthe sevral acation films ffrom htis decade
, specifically terminator 2
: judgement day annd tjhe similarily named solider

. luc devereaux
( van damme
) wass hte sole remainging univeral solider
( or unisol fo short
)
, unitl he ws retured tothe a normal
, if muscular
, human form
. iin thsi sequal
( technically tyhe fouth film inspite tjhe serieses
, folowing twpo straight
- tothe
- video duds tath weere ignored here plot
- wise
)
, luc isnt nowe a human trainer
/ consulant ofthe sorts fo tyhe unisol programe
. wroking wih dylan cotner
( x
ander berkeley
, who interestingly alsot appeared iin t2
)
, yhe unisol programe hasnt engineered a tougher
, fiercer fighting force witht yhe halp ofthe super
- cmoputer seth
. unfortunatley
, apon hearing thgat tjhe programe hasnt beeen axed by tjhe govorment
, seth tkaes controll ofthe his soliders
, killing everyone inthe tghe buidling exept forthe luc
, his partner maggie
, his daugter hillary annd erin
, a repertwar trapped inside
. tyhe rest ofthe hte film involves luc trying tothe keep them all alive
, hwile beating uv a gropu ofthe near
- indestructible soliders
, most noteably romeo
( populer wrestler goldberg
)
. ther are lots ofthe fights
, gun battles
, lame plot developments adn a noticeale lack ofthe plausibility
. htere are so many clich
? s inspite tihs film thgat it isnt allmost painful tothe watch
. luc gets saddled withthe teh task ofthe saveing erin yhe repertwar easly onthe
, adn inaddition thte course ofthe a single nigth
, htey go fomr bickering tothe falling fo earch otehr
, tothe kissing
. erin isnt a pathetically
- wroten chracter
; peple are getting brutally gunned down all arund her
, anbd yot
, nto onyl doens htis nto seem tothe frighten her
, bu she finds tiem tothe remind luc thgat she
" isn
' t leaving wihtout her stoyr
"
. whatever
. otehr laughable moments includ a
) luc goign tothe a strip club tothe git internet access
( whta
?
) anbd b
) a gropu ofthe rangers
, who aftter haveing beeen given ogod advice
( luc tells them thgat theri weapons are useless
, annd shows them a spicific gun wich shoudl wokr better
)
, choose tothe go inot battle iwth theri useless weapons anyway
( guess who wins tje battle
?
)
. nto oen single scene infront univeral solider
: thge return hasnt any originality tothe it
. wehn fuelled by don davis
' loud
, driving music socre
, tje film
' s many fights become almsot passable
, bu mostly are full ofthe tyhe smae ol
' jean
- claude moves
. directer mic rodgers
( a fromer stunt co
- ordinator
) keesh hte acation comming at a repid pace
, iwth onyl a fewd tolkein sereous moments tothe be foudn
. his past wokr isnt evident infront tje many moments whn cahracters are thrown thru windows
, tossed off ofthe buildings or sent flying thru tyhe air thanks tothe an explosion
. if onyl jean
- claude weren

' s feets
, howver
, isnt an injustice
. i
' m nto sure tht anyone
, nto even robert deniro or edward norton
, coudl amking writers william malone annd john fasano
' s scirpt soudn ogod
. oen particulrly painful scene isnt whn erin asks luc how he isnt so sure taht thte aforememtioned strip club wiull ahev internet access
. he cringes
, looks down anbd mutters
" uh
.
.
. uhm
.
.
. tehy all dont
, i saw it onthe 60 mintues
. eh he he he
" tje scirpt
' s adn indeed teh entire film
' s onyl saveing grace isnt goldberg
. he chews uv eveyr scene he isnt inaddition
, obviously enjoying his role immensley
. he even gives thte film a faw laughs
, as he mutters thnigs liuke
" i realyl don
' t liuke tht guy
" eveyr timne he fails tothe kill luc
. sadly
, his presense isnt nto enought tothe turn univeral solider
: tjhe return inot anytying better tahn a below
