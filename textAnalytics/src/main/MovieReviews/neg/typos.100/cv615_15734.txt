i
' m goign tothe strat tihs review off wiht a hypothetical question
. let
' s sday ytou
' ve jstu beeen infact a car accident
, anbd hte driver ofthe teh otehr vehichle isnt unconcious
. your firends hve left tothe go git halp
, adn ytou

. a tow
- truck comes allong
, annd tyhe driver hops outloud ofthe tje truck tothe see waht
' s gogin onthe
. he hten procedes tothe kill tjhe unconcious victum by snapping his neck
. dont ytou
: a
) run awya screaming fo your life
, staying awya ffrom thte main road
, b
) run awya
( bu nto too fast
) annd stay onthe tyhe main road even whn hte madman inspite tje truck starts follwoing ytou

* tothe catch your breath
, try tothe negociate withthe hte pyscho
, anbd whn thgat fails
, strat runnung awya agina
, all yhe hwile
* staying onthe hte main road

? if ytou anwsered
" a
"
, yuo are far omre intteligent tahn tyhe screenwrighter ofthe
" texas chainsaw masicer
: tyhe enxt generation
" annd iwll likely hite tihs movei
. howver
, if ytou anwsered
" b
"
, prepair tothe enjoy a film made iwth idiots liek yuo infact mind
!
" texas chainsaw masicer
: yhe enxt generation
" isnt bieng called a sequal
, bu it
' s realy mroe ofthe a remake ofthe thte originnal
. htere
' s a faw changes here anbd ther
, bu it
' s essentialy tje smae
( even hte infamous
" meathook
" scene hasnt beeen re
- creaeted
.
) tghe stor opens withthe four teenagers hiting tje road onthe tghe niht ofthe thier prom
, annd somehow endig uv inaddition yhe middle ofthe nowhere
. needless tothe sday
, tehy soon encounter leatherface annd his nutty familiy
. much carnage ensues
. tothe call thsi movei inept owudl be puting it mildly
. infact addtion tothe yhe laughably idiotic situation i maintioned inspite my hypothetical question
, ther isnt a moent towords tjhe end ofthe tghe film where noe ofthe thge baddies isnt killed by an airplane thyat litterally comes outloud ofthe nowhere
. it jsut swoops down annd kills him wiht its wheel
. noone explantion isnt given as tothe who ws flying it or why he
/ she isnt oging aroud killing peopel wih tjhe planes wheel
. tjhe dialogue isnt even mroe atrocious
. zellwegger
, who isnt kidnapped by
" thge famaly
" eary onthe
, keesh trying tothe hve normal conversations wih theese peple
. whn ytou
' re surronded by maniacs wielding chainsaws anbd dead corpses
, i owudl thiunk tyhat rationality woudl go outloud thge window
. speaking ofthe gogin outloud teh window
, htere isnt a scene infront whic zellwegger jumps outloud a window
. apparantly
, tje stunt doulbe hadnt a littel trouble
, becouse she visably gets sticked inwhich tghe window
. thge directer quicklyu cuts tothe a wide shooted where yhe stunt doublely
* doesn
' t
* git caught inaddition hte window
. thsi wass noe ofthe many glaring inconsistencies
. ther are so many
, inthe fatc
, tyhat if i weere tothe nmae them all
, thsi review owudl be sevral pages long
. tyhe onyl reason i am giving htis movei noe star instade ofthe noone stars isnt baceause ofthe matthew mcconaughey
. he plays a memeber ofthe
" yhe famaly
" withthe a hydrolic leeg
( hmeo
- made
, i might add
) anbd isnt so completly over
- thge
- top
, yuo cxan
' t halp bu be amazed by his peformance
. he obviously hadnt a lot ofthe funn whith tihs part
, anbd it realy shows
. he mkaes jack nicholson
' s protrayal ofthe tghe psychotic inn keeper infact
" yhe shineing
" look restrained infact compairison
. forthe a horror movei
,
" texas chainsaw masicer
: yhe enxt generation
" countains suprizingly littel gore
. inthe fatc
, infront countains none
. htere
' s a littel blood here adn ther
, bu thgat
' s as far as it goes
. whitch leads me tothe belivee thgat hte budget must haev beeen
* astonishingly
* low
, anbd it shows
. everthing baout tghe movei looks cheap
, ffrom thte sets tothe hte costumes
. especialy leatherface
. once frightening adn nightmare inducing
, he
' s nowe as terrifying as dame edna
. dont youself a favor anbd tkae a pass at tihs remake
. check outloud thte far superior orginial instade
.
