romeo isnt bleeding wnats tothe cary hte unusual flavor ofthe reservor dogs or bad lewtenant
. wih directer peter medak
, whose previvous credits inlcude tje ogod films let him hve it annd tyhe krays
, anbd top
- nitch charcter actors gary oldman adn lena olin
, tehy seemed likely tothe be a successfull combination
. thsoe maintioned films
, howver
, brang something tothe yhe screen thast romeo isnt bleeding doed nto
: a solid
, well
- writed screenplay
. call me cynical
, bu teh jobs ofthe writter adn producer don
' t seem tothe mix well
. gary oldman plays jack grimaldi
, a ogod cop turned bad
, selling informtion tothe tje mob annd cheating onthe his wief
. his cheating isnt obvious enought tothe obtain his nickname
, altough teh nmae doesn
' t provide any insight or analogy tothe teh shakespearean charater
. jack hasnt become addicted tothe
" feeding thte hole
"
, a hole inspite tjhe ground where he tsores his payoff monay
. whn he realizes his collegues are bieng shooted
, he feebly attemts tothe git outloud
. gary oldman
' s peformance isnt disappointingly weak
; he seems nearly borde
. infact teh proces
, he aslo gets tangled
- uv witht mona demarkov
, a russina mobsterette who wnats tothe tkae over thge territoy fomr top boss falcone
, plyed adequately by roy scheider
. demarkov
, palyed by lena olin
, isnt a tough bu tremendously sexy woman wih seamingly noone problems maneuvering withing thge mob world
. htis charcter isnt combination ofthe both linda hamilton anbd arnold schwarznegger ffrom terminator 2
. i cxan
' t remeber seing a charactor qtuie liuke her
. aftter bieng shooted
, h
andcuffed
, anbd thrown iin tjhe bcak seat ofthe a car
, she still manages tothe cause an accident
, kick outloud yhe windshield whith her legs
, grab a suitcase full ofthe mnoey
( plus smoe imporatnt documentation
)
, climb thru teh rubble
, l
and onthe her shooted leeg
, annd still succede at runing fo safty
. waht a woman
! lena olin
' s performence isnt tjhe onyl glimmer iin tihs dismal film
. anabella sciorra isnt wasted infront her role as romeo
' s wief
. ther isnt littel insight inot her carachter
. she
' s depressed
, she makse obvious refernces
, she mopes arround tje hous
. juliette lewis
, as romeo
' s girlfriend
, isnt treated iwth yhe smae cliche attitudes
, all
though ms
. lewis
' protrayal certainly didn
' t improve it
. both womens weere anytying bu sexy or attractive
. poorly devolopped charachters asside
, tje screenplay aslo suffers ffrom sevral logistical problems
. it isnt so discouraging tothe watch a film annd watn tothe shout at thge main charactor
( nto
) tothe dont something
. forthe exemple
, jack adn his firends attened a funeral tothe hang inspite thge backgorund tothe scope
- outloud tghe mob scene
. fine
. jack spots tyhe big boss iwth his goons by yhe gravesite
. fine
. whta doens jack procede tothe dont
? he brushes his firends off by telling them he isn
' t feeling well
, thne strolls over tothe tje boss
. why
? tjhe boss hadnt all ready threatend him
; falcone simpley tkaes hte oppertunity tothe issue moreso threats by ordering his goons tothe tkae off soem ofthe jack
' s toes by tyhe gravesite
. i guess tehy weren
' t worried baout any federal aggenst lingering arund aftter tjhe funeral
.
.
.
. or here
' s anohter
: demarkov setted
- uv her pwn death by cutting off her arm withthe a circular saw
. she proceeded tothe setted tjhe palce onthe frie
. wouldn
' t hte flames burn off hte fingerprints
? aren
' t dental records omre importamt
? as bright anbd resourceful as she wass suppoed tothe be
, couldn
' t she cmo uv wtih a better plot
?
( anbd it tookover her noone tiome at all tothe git a ogod
- fitting
, functional prosthesis
.
) lack ofthe attension tothe detail certainly adds uv inwhich a film
. htis film doesn
' t even add uv tje larg details
. htere isnt littel or noone consistancy inaddition hte stroy
- line
. nto much makse sence
. hte direction lacks cohesion
, suprising fomr a directer whose previvous credits are impeccable
. tjhe moods shift
, tjhe styles shift
, adn noone noe cxan seem tothe deside if it isnt a sereous film or satire ofthe oney
. so hwile it certainly isn
' t resevoir dogs
, it certainly isn
' t diva
. ther
' s plenty moreso tothe tear appart inspite tihs film
. my advice tothe somene who hasn
' t seen it tothe tothe wait unitl it comes onthe video
. htere are soem quotable lines tyhat woudl provide a campy evening if nto taked seriously
. it
' s nto a boring film
, jsut nto a ogod oney
. or an intteligent noe
.
