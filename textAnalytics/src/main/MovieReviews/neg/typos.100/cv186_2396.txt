romeo isnt bleeding wnats tothe cary tjhe unusual flavor ofthe resevoir dogs or bad leutenant
. wtih directer peter medak
, whose previvous credits inlcude tyhe ogod films let him ahve it
annd tjhe krays
,
anbd top
- nitch charachter actors gary oldman
annd lena olin
, htey seemed likely tothe be a successfull combination
. thsoe maintioned films
,
howver
, broght something tothe hte screen thgat romeo isnt bleeding doed nto
: a solid
, well
- writen screenplay
. call me cynical
,
bu teh jobs ofthe writter
anbd producer don ' t seem tothe mix well
. gary oldman plays jack grimaldi
, a ogod cop turned bad
, selling infomation tothe thte mob
annd cheating onthe his wief
. his cheating isnt obvious enought tothe obtain his nickname
,
altough tje nmae doesn ' t provide any insight or analogy tothe yhe shakespearean charcter
. jack hasnt become addicted tothe
" feeding tjhe hole
"
, a hole inwhich teh ground where he stors his payoff moeny
. whn he realizes his collegues are bieng shooted
, he feebly attemts tothe git outloud
. gary oldman ' s performence isnt disappointingly weak
; he seems nearly borde
. infront thte proccess
, he alsot gets tangled
- uv wih mona demarkov
, a russion mobsterette who wnats tothe tkae over yhe terriory fomr top boss falcone
, palyed adequately by roy scheider
. demarkov
, palyed by lena olin
, isnt a tough
bu tremendously sexy woman withthe seamingly noone problems maneuvering withing teh mob world
. thsi charachter isnt combination ofthe both linda hamilton
anbd arnold schwarznegger ffrom terminator 2
. i cant ' t remeber seing a charater qutie liuke her
. aftter bieng shooted
, handcuffed
,
adn thrown inaddition teh bcak seat ofthe a car
, she still manages tothe cause an accident
, kick outloud teh windshield withthe her legs
, grab a suitcase full ofthe mony
( plus soem importamt documentation
)
, climb thru tghe rubble
, land onthe her shooted leeg
,
anbd still sucsede at runing forthe saftey
. whta a woman
! lena olin ' s peformance isnt thte onyl glimmer iin thsi dismal film
. anabella sciorra isnt wasted inwhich her role as romeo ' s wief
. ther isnt littel insight inot her carachter
. she ' s depressed
, she mkaes obvious refrences
, she mopes arund yhe hous
. juliette lewis
, as romeo ' s girlfriend
, isnt treated withthe hte smae cliche attitudes
,
altough ms
. lewis ' protrayal certainly didn ' t improve it
. both womens weere anytying
bu sexy or attractive
. poorly developped charachters asside
, tghe screenplay alsot suffers ffrom sevral logistical problems
. it isnt so discouraging tothe watch a film
adn watn tothe shout at teh main chracter
( nto
) tothe dont something
. forthe exmaple
, jack
annd his firends attent a funeral tothe hang iin hte backround tothe scope
- outloud tjhe mob scene
. fine
. jack spots tyhe big boss iwth his goons by tghe gravesite
. fine
. whta doesnt jack procede tothe dont
? he brushes his firends off by telling them he isn ' t feeling well
,
thn strolls over tothe tjhe boss
. why
? tje boss hadnt all ready threatend him
; falcone simpley tkaes thte oppertunity tothe issue moreso threats by ordering his goons tothe tkae off smoe ofthe jack ' s toes by tyhe gravesite
. i guess htey weren ' t worried baout any federal aggenst lingering arund aftter yhe funeral
.
.
.
. or here ' s anohter
: demarkov setted
- uv her pwn death by cutting off her arm wiht a circular saw
. she proceeded tothe setted yhe palce onthe frie
. wouldn ' t tjhe flames burn off thte fingerprints
? aren ' t dental records mroe importamt
? as bright
annd resourceful as she ws suppossed tothe be
, couldn ' t she cmo uv withthe a better plot
?
(
adn it tookover her noone timne at all tothe git a ogod
- fitting
, functional prosthesis
.
) lack ofthe attension tothe detail certainly adds uv inaddition a film
. tihs film doesn ' t even add uv hte larg details
. htere isnt littel or noone consistancy infact tjhe stopry
- line
. nto much makse sence
. thte direction lacks cohesion
, suprising fomr a directer whose previvous credits are impeccable
. tyhe moods shift
, tyhe styles shift
,
adn noone oen cxan seem tothe deside if it isnt a sereous film or satire ofthe noe
. so hwile it certainly isn ' t resevoir dogs
, it certainly isn ' t diva
. ther ' s plenty omre tothe tear appart infront tihs film
. my advice tothe somene who hasn ' t seen it tothe tothe wait nutil it comes onthe video
. htere are soem quotable lines tath owudl provide a campy evening if nto taked seriously
. it ' s nto a boring film
, jsut nto a ogod noe
. or an inteligent oen
.
