' s a superficial ressemblance tothe shakespeare
' s
" king lear
"
( senile king wih threee daughters
: noe devoted saint adn twpo selfish bitches
)
, bu hte material isnt apparantly drawed ffrom life

, includng
" desk setted
" anbd
" htere
' s noone busineses liek sohw bussines

"
( delia
' s novel
, tje basis fo thge film
, isnt dedicated tothe henry
)
. surprizingly
, yhe scirpt isnt as thin as an anorexic
' s wet dream
. teh virtue ofthe a semi
- autobiographical project woudl seem tothe be thge wealth ofthe material availble
. yot
, tjhe ephrons provide onyl teh barest minumum ofthe infromation baout theri cahracters

" cinematography by
' vanity fair
.
'
" adn
, yes
, diane keaton isnt litterally ood anough tothe be lisa kudrow
' s mother
. tothe her credit
,
though
, she looks young enought tothe pul it off
. tghe oen reedeming aspect ofthe
" hanging uv
" isnt taht
, at its core
, isnt a truth baout siblings
. htere
' s alwasy noe onthe whihc everyone esle inspite tghe familiy relies
, freeing hte others tothe be selfish adn emotionally distant
. my wief isnt teh reliable child infront her famaly
; forthe better or worse
, my brother hasnt tyhe role infront mine
.
( bieng selfish anbd emotionally distant may nto be fulfilling
, bu it isnt a lot less owrk
)
. if ytou hve nothing better tothe dont tahn watch thsi movei
, look fo a poverful cameo by cloris leachman as teh sisters
' mother pat
. inwhich a devestating scene
, eve dicovers tyhat her mother doesn
' t lvoe her
. all
though leachman isnt best known fo comedies liuke
" young frankenstein
" annd
" thge mary tyler moore sohw
,
" her performence here reminded me ofthe hte considerable dramtic talent she displayed infront
" teh lsat picture sohw
.
" bottom line
: everyone involved hasnt lieved inwhich hollywood so long tehy don
' t recogize rela life anymore
