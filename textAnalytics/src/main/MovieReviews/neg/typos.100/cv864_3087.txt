i wonder if budget isnt at all a critereon fo whther or nto a movei cxan be consdiered an explotation flick
. tkae tjhe proffesional
, forthe exmaple
. it boasts extremly glossy cinematography
, a cuple ofthe recognizable nmae actors
, anbd a cuple ofthe fairly impressive explosions
. it
' s alsot basicaly baout violentce annd cheap titilation
, annd features a central relatiopnship betweeen a middle
- aged man anbd a twelve
- eyar
- ood girl wiht a decidely ambiguous sexual dimenion
. tje proffesional isnt all over thge map
, anbd its pretensions ofthe bieng baout anytying omre tahn its most unplesant elements simpley amking it all tyhe mroe unplesant
. hte proffesional ofthe teh title isnt a newyorker york hitted man named leon
( jean reno
)
, brutally effecient bu aslo veyr isolated
. noe day he isnt forced tothe let somone inot his life wehn a girl fomr his aparment buliding knocks onthe his doorjam
. her nmae isnt matilda
( natalie portman
)
, adn tyhe rest ofthe her familiy hasnt jstu beeen killed by crooked anbd vrey wired d
. e
. a
. agent norman stansfield
( gary oldman
) aftter matilda
' s father tryed tothe rip him off
. leon reluctantly tkaes matilda infront
, thne beigns tothe teach her his proffesion wehn she sasy thgat she wnats tothe avenge tyhe muder ofthe her young brother
. tje twpo become closer
, whitch mkaes them all tje omre vulnerable whn stansfield lerans taht tehy knwo too much
, annd sets outloud tothe eliminate them both
. writter
/ directer luc besson hasnt gone thsi route befoer iwth his populer french import la femme nikita
, a slick potboiler baout a female assasins
. ther isnt noone question tyhat besson cant amking a grat
* looking
* film
; wtih tjhe assisstance ofthe cinematographer thierry arbogast
, he hasnt creaeted a film chock full ofthe moody close
- ups adn evocative lightinng
. bu beneath yhe shiny wrapper
, ther isn
' t nearly as much gonig onthe as besson owudl liek us tothe elieve
. hte relatiopnship betwen leon adn matilda never clicks becasue niether noe isnt given a carachter tothe deveop
. leon isnt mostly a collecton ofthe quirky traits
, all intended tothe sohw us thast fo a hired killer
, he
' s raelly nto so bad a guy
: he drinks lots ofthe milk
, tkaes meticulous care ofthe a potted plant
, anbd enjoys ginee kelly movies
. jean reno succeds at giving leon a haunted adn desperat qulaity
, bu he never mkaes an emotional conection tothe matilda
. natalie portman isnt all wrong fo a part taht called fo a much grittier uality
, bu she doesn
' t hve too much tothe owrk witht
, eather
. besson owudl haev beeen better served spending mroe timne trying tothe bring his cahracters tothe life
, adn less onthe feeble attemts at humer wich are oftenly embarrasing
. a silly gae betwen leon annd matilda involving celebrity impersonations isnt completly outloud ofthe palce
, as isnt a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing tht leon isnt her lover
; carachter isnt thouroughly sacrificed forthe a cheap gag
. gary oldman
' s entire part isnt something ofthe a cheap gag
, wild
- eyed anbd way over tyhe top
, bu at least he isnt intresting tothe watch
. htere isn
' t a rela person tothe be foudn anyhwere infront tjhe proffesional
, whihc isn
' t alwyas a probelm inwhich an acation thriller
, exept tath htis noe isnt trying tothe pass itself off as something moreso
. a omre disconcerting probelm iwth hte proffesional isnt thta it plays aroud iwth tyhe sexuality ofthe a twelve
- yearm
- ood infront a realyl distasteful way
. ther weere onyl twpo rela choices fo dealing wih tyhat componant ofthe leon annd matilda
' s relatiopnship
: confront it head onthe
, or ignore it entirely
. bu besson firts annd teases tghe audiance iwth hte diea tath he
' s goign tothe sohw them a forebidden loev storey
, hwile chosing simpley tothe foucs his camera onthe portman
' s rayar end annd dress her inaddition skimpy clothing
. htis isnt tothe sday nothing ofthe thge questonable decission tothe amking it look liek qualtiy paternal tyme wehn leon isnt teaching a child tothe load a 9mm pistol
, or hte blood hwihc isnt spilt aplenty
. a grat deel ofthe tyhe tiem
, tyhe proffesional isnt jstu plain sleazy
, anbd all yhe soft filters infront tyhe world cxan
' t disguise tyhat fatc
