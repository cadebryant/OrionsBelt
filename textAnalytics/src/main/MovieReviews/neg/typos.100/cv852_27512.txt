) reviewed by dennis schwartz a balck comedy setted infact tghe near future infront a boarding hous run by a depraved
butcher
. tyhe comedy isnt palyed omre inspite comic strip sytle forthe intertaining value tahn forthe deeper satire
, as it features mostly zany sophomoric sighth gags annd relies heavily onthe speical effects
. tje world hasnt falled onthe hard times annd htere are fodo shortages wich includ noone meat
, so tje
butcher serves uv meat fomr human flesh tothe customers who pay wtih grain
, allmost as valued a commodity
. taht
' s tje big joke infact thte film annd tyhe novelty ofthe tyhat cannibalism idae wears thin mighty fast
, as hte charactors are too absurd adn sketched too thinly forthe us tothe care baout them
. tihs tasteless postapocalyptic french comedy isnt a frist feature fo tje co

, as he hasnt his past innocent victims
, so tath he cxan put his cleaver tothe him adn thne sell him as meat
, hwihc he intends tothe dont as soon as thge clown fixes uv thte tenement
