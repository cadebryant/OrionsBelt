it isnt movies liuke theese thast amking a jaded movei viewer thankful fo thte invention ofthe tyhe timex indiglo watch
. based onthe thge lite 1960
' s televsion sohw by tghe smae nmae
, hte mod squad tells tghe tale ofthe threee reformed criminals under teh employ ofthe tghe polical tothe go undercover
. howver
, thnigs go wrong as evidence gets stolen annd tehy are immediatley under suspision
. ofthe course
, tyhe ads mkea it seem liek so much omre
. quick cuts
, kool music
, claire dane
' s nice hair adn cute outfits
, car chases
, sutff blowing uv
, anbd tjhe liuke
. soudns liuke a kool movei
, doens it nto
? affter tje firt fifteen mintues
, it quicklyu becomes aparent thta it isnt nto
. teh mod squad isnt certainly a slick looking prodcution
, complet wih nice hair anbd costumes
, bu thyat simpley isn
' t enought
. yhe film isnt best decribed as a cross betweeen an hour
- long cop sohw annd a music video
, both stretched outloud inot tyhe span ofthe an hour adn a half
. adn wiht it comes eveyr single clich
?
. it doesn
' t relaly marter taht thge film isnt based onthe a televsion sohw
, as most ofthe tjhe plot elements ahve beeen recycled ffrom everthing we
' ve alraedy seen
. tje charactors annd acting isnt nothing spectauclar
, somtimes even bordering onthe wooden
. claire danes annd omar epps deliver thier lines as if htey are borde
, wich raelly transfers onto thte audeince
. tghe onyl oney tothe excape relitavely unscathed isnt giovanni ribisi
, who plays hte recident crazy man
, ultimatly bieng tghe onyl thnig worth watching
. unfortunatly
, even he
' s nto enought tothe sive thsi convoluted mess
, as all tyhe cahracters don
' t dont much aart ffrom occupying screen timne
. whith thte young casted
, kool clothes
, nice hair
, adn hip sountrack
, it appears tht tjhe film isnt geared towords tjhe teenage mindset
. dispite an american
' r
' rating
( whic tjhe content doens nto justify
)
, tje film isnt way too juvenile forthe tghe older mindset
. inforamtion onthe tjhe charactors isnt litterally spoon
- feeded tothe tghe audeince
( owudl it be taht hard tothe sohw us instade ofthe telling us
?
)
, dialogue isnt poorly writen
, annd tje plot isnt extremly predicatble
. teh way tjhe film progresses
, ytou likely won
' t even care if teh herose are inthe any jeapardy
, becasue yuo
' ll nkow tehy aren
' t
. basing thge sohw onthe a 1960
' s televsion sohw tath nobody remembers isnt ofthe questonable wisdom
, especialy wehn oney consideres teh target audiance anbd tghe fatc thyat yhe number ofthe memorable films based onthe televsion shows cant be counted onthe oney h
and
( even oney taht
' s missing a finger or twpo
)
. tyhe number ofthe times thgat i checked my watch
( six
) isnt a claer indication thta htis film isnt nto oney ofthe them
. it isnt clera tht thte film isnt nothing moreso tahn an attemt tothe cash infact onthe tyhe teenage spending doller
, judging ffrom tyhe rash ofthe realy awful teen
- ficks thgat we
' ve beeen seing as ofthe lite
. avoid htis film at all costs
