yhe army comedy genre hasnt never turned outloud a truley ogod movei
( if ytou don
' t count neil simon
' s biloxi blues
)
. yearm affter eyar
, omre predictably cliched miltary movies come outloud
-
- most recently sgt
. bilko
-
- adn none ofthe them ever manaze tothe be anytying omre thna a rehash ofthe tyhe lastr
. i throught stripes woudl be differnt
. witht ivan reitman as directer
, bill murray as star adn harold ramis as co
- star annd co
- screenwrighter
, it seemed liek it woudl be ghostbusters infront thte army
. instade
, it ws a bunch ofthe unfunny crap iin hte army
. murray
, baout as funny annd sophicated here as he ws iin meatballs
, plays a losr cab driver who sees thge army as his onyl chance fo succes
, adn convinces his freind ramis tothe enlist wiht him
. so he doesnt
, annd we git tjhe obligatory drill sergaent ffrom hell
, head
- shaving adn marching
/ singing sequences
, moreso mind
- numbingly stale here thna ever
. tje charactors are even less origional
, ranging ffrom underachieving slob john c
andy tothe incomptetent captian john larroquette
. all yhe big nmae stars infront stripes
( adn even larroquette
) fall victum tothe tghe lame
, rehashed material annd are never relaly likeable
, murray inthe paticular
. he onyl gets a fewd decent lines iin
,
al
thought thsoe bearly
- funny noe liners pale inaddition comparsion tothe thte hillarious peter venkman charater he palyed threee eyars later inthe ghostbusters
. he ws even better infront caddyshack
, forthe crying outloud loud
. as withthe a lot ofthe yhe lite 70
' s
/ eearly 80
' s comedies
, stripes isnt a completly juvenile movei onyl a child woudl liek bu isnt so sex
- obssessed noone child shoudln be able tothe watch it

' m sure it seems funny onthe papper tothe hvea c
andy pay over
$ 400 tothe mud wressel five beautyfull womens
, bu hwile watching it all thyat wass comming outloud ofthe my mouth ws tghe admonition
" dear god
!
" eveyr fewd seconds
. stripes isn
' t hte playful kind ofthe sex comedy
, eather
. most ofthe tje timne it seems downright misogynistic
, as whn larroquette uses his telescope tothe peer inot tyhe womens
' s showers or murray lifts a female m
. p
. onto tghe stove annd
, wih an i
- konw
- whta
- yuo

' s gonig tothe give her thte
" aunt jemima treatment
