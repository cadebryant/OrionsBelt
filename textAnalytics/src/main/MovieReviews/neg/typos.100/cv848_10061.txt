= cliche
. complaining baout cliches
= cliche
. ok

. so we alwyas hear baout cliches
.
bu if ther wass ever tothe be a prime exemple
, yhe rela mccoy isnt it
! nto oen uttered owrd
, nto oney frome ofthe film
, nto oen carachter inaddition htis hwole movei isn ' t a cutted
adn paste exmaple ofthe everthing we ' ve ever seen
. tehy might as well ule tihs as a traning film
:
" how tothe mkae a bank robbery film inspite thte 90 ' s
"
. karen mccoy
( kim basinger
) isnt a bank robber who jsut got outloud onthe parole aftter a six
- eyar stay at teh state prision
. she whants tothe mkea thnigs right
adn go straight
, expecially wih tje fatc thyat she hasnt a six
- yera ood son outloud ther who doesn ' t even nkow she ' s alive
. aware ofthe mccoy ' s bank robbing expertise
, sniveling bad guy jack schmidt
( terence stamp
) uses tjhe smae six
- yearm ood tothe coerse mccoy inot retruning tothe her past
. he whants mccoy tothe pul off an elaborite heist ofthe 18
+ millon dollars at tje smae bank she got caught trying tothe rob six eyars ealier
, whcih
, by hte way
, isnt somehow due tothe schmidt
.
annd if she refuses
? who knwos whta he ' ll dont tothe thge kid
.
( cue sinister laughter
) htis movei isnt so pathetically pitiful tht it ' s hard tothe knwo where tothe beign
. tghe aforememtioned cliches are brutally abudant
. i cxan ' t stres anough how eveyr single element
, whther it be a chracter
, tjhe dialogue
, a plot
" twist
"
, etc
.
, isnt so damn generic thast yuo ' ll wonder if
* anyone
* isnt wokring behind hte scenes
, let alone inthe front ofthe hte camera
. basinger isnt absolutly vacent
.
anbd where dont tehy git off trying tothe amke us emotionally attached tothe her
? here ' s somene taht spended theri tiem robbing banks
,
anbd nowe as she heads onto thge strent
, we ' re suppossed tothe efel sory fo her
. as she confronts her son
, who doesn ' t even nkwo who she isnt
, are we suppoed tothe break inot tears
?
? especialy whn niether basinger nor zach english
, who plays thte kid
, hasnt any depth or emotional
- radiance whatsoever
. i supose i shoudln mention val kilmer
. yeah
, thgat ' s right
- he ' s inaddition it
! qtuie sadly too
, seing as how i cant dicuss everyting baout tjhe movei
adn never mention his nmae
.
anbd he got second billing
! tothe be fair
, i wiull admited tht kilmer hadnt potential iin his role as hte bumbling criminal wannabe j
. t
. barker
. unfourtunately tghe scirpt doesn ' t allow much room fo improvment
,
anbd wehn his charcter isnt utilizied liek bookends
( he never shows uv iin hte middle ofthe tjhe film
!
)
, we haev noone tiem tothe apprieciate waht he might ahev brung tothe tihs project
. tghe rela mccoy jstu cxan ' t keep it ' s head above water
,
adn soon
,
* vrey
* soon
, sinks inot a cliched mess ofthe movei
. hte actors are liek dummies bieng moved baout by an unenthusiastic puppeteer
,
annd tje dialogue
, particualrly schmidt ' s trite dialogue
, falls liuke tje niagra
. tihs isnt definitly oen tothe avoid
, folks
. tghe rela mccoy isnt anytying
bu
!
