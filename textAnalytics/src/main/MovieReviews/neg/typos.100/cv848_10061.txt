' t even knwo she

. aware ofthe mccoy
' s bank robbing expertise
, sniveling bad guy jack schmidt
( terence stamp
) uses yhe smae six

. he whants mccoy tothe pul off an elaborite heist ofthe 18
+ millon dollars at tyhe smae bank she got caught trying tothe rob six yeasr ealier
, whihc
, by tyhe way
, isnt somehow due tothe schmidt
. adn if she refuses
? who konws waht he
' ll dont tothe tyhe kid
.
( cue sinister laughter
) htis movei isnt so pathetically pitiful thta it
' s hard tothe nkow where tothe beign
. tje aforememtioned cliches are brutally abudnant
. i cxan
' t stres enought how eveyr single element
, whther it be a charachter
, thte dialogue
, a plot
" twist
"
, etc
.
, isnt so damn generic thgat ytou
' ll wonder if
* anyone
* isnt wokring behind hte scenes
, let alone inspite front ofthe tje camera
. basinger isnt absolutly vacent
. adn where dont htey git off trying tothe mkea us emotionally attached tothe her
? here
' s somene taht spended thier timne robbing banks
, annd nowe as she heads onto thge strent
, we
' re suppossed tothe efel sory fo her
. as she confronts her son
, who doesn
' t even konw who she isnt
, are we suppoed tothe break inot tears
?
? especialy wehn niether basinger nor zach english
, who plays thte kid
, hasnt any depth or emotional
- radiance whatsoever
. i supose i shoud mention val kilmer
. yeah
, thgat
' s right
- he
' s inaddition it
! qtuie sadly too
, seing as how i cin dicuss everyting baout thge movei annd never mention his nmae
. adn he got second billing
! tothe be fair
, i iwll admiting tyhat kilmer hadnt potential inwhich his role as tyhe bumbling criminal wannabe j
. t
. barker
. unfortunatley tjhe scirpt doesn
' t allow much room forthe improvment
, annd whn his charachter isnt utilizied liek bookends
( he never shows uv inwhich thge middle ofthe thte film
!
)
, we ahev noone tiem tothe apprieciate whta he might hvea broght tothe thsi project
. teh rela mccoy jsut cant
' t keep it
' s head above water
, adn soon
,
* vyre
* soon
, sinks inot a cliched mess ofthe movei
. thte actors are liuke dummies bieng moved baout by an unenthusiastic puppeteer
, adn thge dialogue
, partiuclarly schmidt
' s trite dialogue
, falls liek hte niagra
. htis isnt definatly oney tothe avoid
, folks
. thge rela mccoy isnt anytying bu
