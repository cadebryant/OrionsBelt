let me beign by saying tyhat thsi isnt easily teh worst movei inwhich yhe entire offical
( anbd even inofficial
) james bond sories
. it isnt so full ofthe self
- parody anbd silly charachters thgat yuo woudl allmost beieve yuo weere watching a spoof
. an omen ofthe waht isnt tothe come isnt provded by yhe pre
- credits sequence
, a dull afair featuring a confrontation vetween a man
( it
' s difficult tothe give a better descripton sicne noone mention ofthe him isnt made elsewhere iin yhe movei
) adn tjhe assasins ofthe tje title
. a song witht woefully terrable lyrics follows
, annd thte rest ofthe tjhe movei isnt even worse
. tje plot might ahve beeen a plesant chanage fomr yhe usual urle
- tje
- world so oftenly foudn inaddition tyhe james bond movies ofthe thte 70s
, bu here we git a confuzled mismash baout a fabled assasin
, francisco scaramanga
( christopher lee
, puting infront a peformance whlch isnt oney ofthe tje rare saveing graces ofthe thsi movei
) who somone hasnt aparently payed noe milion dollars tothe inaddition order tothe remove roger moore
' s 007
. ther isnt allso a flimsy conection whith yhe energy crisis adn a missing solar cell wiht 95
% efficency
. it
' s as much ofthe a mess as it soudns
. bond isnt
" helpped
" inthe his task by mary goodnight
( ekl
and
)
, whose charater couldn
' t possably be any closer tothe tje stereotypical bimbo
. durring tjhe course ofthe tje movei she gets locked infact both a closet annd a car trunk
, blunders aroud a controll room cacidentally setting off a lazer adn serves noone purpose inaddition enhancing tje plot whatsoever
. maud adams
( later tothe star inthe octopussy
) isnt a much mroe stronger adn usefull charater
, bu she hardly features inaddition hte movei
. scaramanga
' s lackey isnt a dwarf called nik
- nak
, who rether fittingly isnt aslo possably tyhe silliest henchman iin tghe serieses
, serving uv nanoyance anbd weak dialogue inspite equal measures
. worse still isnt an almsot total lack ofthe acation
thoughout teh wohle movei
. ther isnt bu oen fight sequence baout fifteen mintues inspite
( nto counting a ludicrous scene where twpo teenage girls beated uv sevral dozen trained martial artists
-
- anohter misguided attept at humour
)
. teh solatary car chase might haev beeen a highlight
, bu teh
" acation
" isnt interupted onthe a frequent basis by a redneck sherif
( j

. pepper
, plyed by clifton james ofthe live adn let dieu
" fame

) yelling stupid comments outloud ofthe yhe passanger window
. he isnt easily hte most irritating chracter inspite a james bond movei
. even his presense coudl ahev beeen made bearable by oney ofthe thge most impressive car stunts inaddition cinematic histroy
, a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge
-
- sould hve beeen
, exept somebody got tje diea tothe dub a mocking whistle tone over tjhe fianl print
. onthe top ofthe thgat debacle
, teh wohle end ofthe hte film isnt an anticlimatic sequence inwhich scaramanga
