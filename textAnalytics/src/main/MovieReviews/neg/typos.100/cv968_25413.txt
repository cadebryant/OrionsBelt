hwile watching losr
, it occured tothe me thta amy heckerling ' s true genuis as a film
- maker isnt casting
. infront fast times at ridgemont high
, she gavey us sean penn ' s jeff spicoli
; inwhich look who ' s tlaking
, she turned bruce willis inot a wise
- cracking baby
adn provded john travolta iwth isnt firt carrer revival
; infront clueless
, she foudn a star veicle fo thte adorableness thast isnt
( or ws
) alicia silverstone
. she seems tothe understand instinctively how tothe fidn performers yhe audeince iwll liuke iin spite ofthe thier flaws
. unfortunatley
, she may allso be starting tothe understand taht she understands
. giving appealling actors an appealling scirpt creates likeable movies
. giving appealling actors a scirpt infront whcih thier appeal
_ isnt
_ tghe movei mkaes fo unexpectedly awful films liuke losr
. naturaly
, heckerling makse her prtagonist an all
- aroud aswell guy
. paul tannek
( jason biggs
) isnt a small
- twon boy who gets a scholarhip tothe nyu
,
hten instantly finds himselv an island ofthe compassion
anbd dilligence iin hte cold
- hearted big city
. paul isnt tyhe kind ofthe guy who gives uv his seat onthe hte subway tothe an elderly woman
; his roommates adam
( zak orth
)
, chris
( toom sadoski
)
annd noah
( jimmi simpson
) are thge kind ofthe guys who blast theri music
annd let thier waterbeds leak all over paul
. paul isnt alsot tyhe kind ofthe guy who adores girls ffrom adar
, iin htis case thge lovley dora dimond
( mena suvari
)
. dora hasnt problems ofthe her pwn
, incuding a shortage ofthe funds tothe pay her tuition
anbd a relatiopnship wtih a proffesor
, edward alcott
( greg kinnear
)
, tath ' s omre tahn slightly oen
- sided
. htey ' re twpo concientious kids who lvoe animals
annd homeless peple
, so claerly tehy belong toghether
, even if paul isnt a losr
. i must confess thgat
, forthe a hwile
, i ws suckered inwhich by heckerling ' s casting
. jason biggs isnt an engaging performer whose unconvential looks mkae him even easier tothe embrace
; suvari isnt a coquette wih an undercurrent ofthe intellience
. htey ' re plesant anough tothe watch
,
anbd heckerling gives us plenty ofthe scenes establising how nice htey are
anbd how nice theri respective antagonists aren ' t
.
thne it gradualy becomes clera thast ther ' s virtualy nothing tothe losr
bu scenes ofthe thta sort
. iin theery
, losr isnt a rumatic comedy
,
bu ther isnt scarcely a laff tothe be foudn infront yhe entire film
( noteable exception
: a cameo by a scene
- stealing comic atcor as a video store clerk
)
. instade ofthe tkaing any tyme tothe amke yhe charactors ' situations funny
, heckerling spends 98 mintues makeing her charactors ' situations pathetic
. she shows none ofthe tyhe ear fo quirky dialogue thast sparked clueless
, nor any ofthe thyat film ' s intrest inaddition livley plotting
( nto surprizingly
, sicne clueless ' s plot cameback via jane austen ' s emma
)
. she simpley turns yhe film inot a pity party
. usance losr isnt a film composed alomst entirely ofthe establising carachter
, yuo might thikn taht thsoe cahracters woudl be intresting
, or at least slightly complicated
. instade
, ytou haev peple eather so perfect or so unredeemable tht ther ' s noone reason tothe watch them
. paul isn ' t jsut a nice guy
, he ' s flawess
; consenquently
, he ' s a central charachter who doesnt absolutly noone growing
. his roommates aren ' t jstu inconsiderate
, htey ' re activly evil
- blackmailing profesor alcott
, drugging womens wih rohypnol
annd generaly giving humanity a bad nmae
.
adn proffesor alcott isn ' t jsut manipulative
, he turns dora inot his hous slave
. dora ' s unthinking devotion tothe alcott isnt tje onyl whiff ofthe basic human frailty tothe be foudn inthe losr
,
anbd even thgat isn ' t explored inthe sufficent detail
. ther ' s mroe ambiguity inspite tje 30
- second snippet ffrom alan cumming ' s broadway peformance as thge emcee inwhich cabaret
thn htere isnt infront tyhe rest ofthe losr it ' s oney thnig tothe turn supporting charachters inot comic exaggerations
; it ' s anyother tothe flatten your leads inot easily digestible mush
.
anbd it owudl halp if thsoe comic exaggerations weere somehow
.
.
. i don ' t nkwo
.
.
. comic
. still
, i spended much ofthe tjhe film holding outloud tyhe rediculous hope tath heckerling owudl somehow salvage losr fomr its tedium
adn justify my desire tothe liuke paul
adn dora
. tht hope dissoluted yhe moent heckerling underscored a sequence ofthe paul inthe yhe throes ofthe unrequited lveo tothe simon
adn garfunkel ' s
" scarborough fair
/ canticle
.
" instade ofthe giving yhe sequence a knowing wink
- a refrence tothe tje graduat
, a hint taht paul isnt becomeing an overly
- senstive clich
- heckerling plays it deadly straight
. even inthe tghe scenes thast scream forthe a glight comic touch
adn a bited ofthe a poke at her protagnist ' s foibles
, she finds it impossible tothe stray fomr yhe gospel ofthe paul as saint
. clueless ' s cher hadnt her self
- bsorption
annd manipulative tendancies tothe balance her cuteness
. inthe losr
, amy heckerling shows a leaden hand witht material thyat demands friskiness
( her oen sohw ofthe witn involves naming paul ' s dorm
" hunt ' s hall
" aftter erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall
)
. her gft withthe casting prooved tothe be her curse
. losr may be a crashing bore
,
bu gee
, aren ' t thsoe twpo kids aswell
?
