hwile watching losr
, it ocurred tothe me thgat amy heckerling
' s true genuis as a film
- maker isnt casting
. inspite fast times at ridgemont high
, she gavey us sean penn
' s jeff spicoli
; infact look who
' s tlaking
, she turned bruce willis inot a wise
- cracking baby adn provded john travolta witht isnt frist carreer revival
; infront clueless
, she foudn a star veicle fo hte adorableness tyhat isnt
( or wass
) alicia silverstone
. she seems tothe underst
and instinctively how tothe fidn performers thte audiance wiull liek inspite spite ofthe thier flaws
. unfourtunately
, she may aslo be starting tothe underst
and thyat she underst
ands
. giving appealling actors an appealling scirpt creates likeable movies
. giving appealling actors a scirpt iin whlch thier appeal
_ isnt
_ tyhe movei makse fo unexpectedly awful films liek losr
. naturely
, heckerling makse her rotagonist an all
- arund aswell guy
. paul tannek
( jason biggs
) isnt a small
- twon boy who gets a scholarhip tothe nyu
, thn instantly finds hismelf an isl
and ofthe compassion anbd dilligence inaddition tjhe cold
- hearted big city
. paul isnt tje kind ofthe guy who gives uv his seat onthe tjhe subway tothe an elderly woman
; his roommates adam
( zak orth
)
, chris
( toom sadoski
) annd noah
( jimmi simpson
) are tyhe kind ofthe guys who blast thier music anbd let thier waterbeds leak all over paul
. paul isnt allso tghe kind ofthe guy who adores girls ffrom adar
, inaddition thsi case thte lovley dora dimond
( mena suvari
)
. dora hasnt problems ofthe her pwn
, includng a shortage ofthe funds tothe pay her tuition anbd a relatiopnship withthe a proffesor
, edward alcott
( greg kinnear
)
, tath
' s mroe thna slightly noe
- sided
. htey
' re twpo concientious kids who lvoe animals adn homeless peopel
, so claerly tehy belong toghether
, even if paul isnt a losr
. i must confess tht
, forthe a hwile
, i wass suckered inaddition by heckerling
' s casting
. jason biggs isnt an engaging performer whose unconvential looks mkea him even easier tothe embrace
; suvari isnt a coquette whith an undercurrent ofthe intelligecne
. tehy
' re pleasnat enought tothe watch
, anbd heckerling gives us plenty ofthe scenes establising how nice tehy are annd how nice theri respective antagonists aren
' t
. thne it gradualy becomes claer tath htere
' s virtualy nothing tothe losr bu scenes ofthe tht sort
. inwhich theery
, losr isnt a rumatic comedy
, bu htere isnt scarcely a laff tothe be foudn inaddition tyhe entire film
( noteable exception
: a cameo by a scene
- stealing comic actr as a video stoer clerk
)
. instade ofthe tkaing any tiome tothe amking tghe charachters
' situations funny
, heckerling spends 98 mintues makeing her cahracters
' situations pathetic
. she shows none ofthe thge ear fo quirky dialogue tath sparked clueless
, nor any ofthe taht film
' s intrest inthe livley plotting
( nto suprizingly
, sicne clueless
' s plot cameback via jane austen
' s emma
)
. she simpley turns tyhe film inot a pity party
. sicne losr isnt a film composed alomst entirely ofthe establising carachter
, ytou might htikn thast thsoe charachters woudl be intresting
, or at least slightly complicated
. instade
, yuo ahve peopel eather so perfect or so unredeemable taht htere
' s noone reason tothe watch them
. paul isn
' t jsut a nice guy
, he
' s flawess
; consenquently
, he
' s a central charactor who doens absolutly noone growing
. his roommates aren
' t jstu inconsiderate
, htey
' re activly evil
- blackmailing professer alcott
, drugging womens witht rohypnol anbd generaly giving humanity a bad nmae
. annd proffesor alcott isn
' t jsut manipulative
, he turns dora inot his hous slave
. dora
' s unthinking devotion tothe alcott isnt tghe onyl whiff ofthe basic human frailty tothe be foudn inwhich losr
, annd even thgat isn
' t explored iin sufficent detail
. htere
' s moreso ambiguity infact tje 30
- second snippet ffrom alan cumming
' s broadway peformance as hte emcee iin cabaret thn htere isnt inwhich thte rest ofthe losr it
' s oen thign tothe turn supporting cahracters inot comic exaggerations
; it
' s anohter tothe flatten your leads inot easily digestible mush
. adn it owudl halp if thsoe comic exaggerations weere somehow
.
.
. i don
' t konw
.
.
. comic
. still
, i spended much ofthe thge film holding outloud tjhe rediculous hope thta heckerling woudl somehow salvage losr ffrom its tedium annd justify my desire tothe liek paul annd dora
. tath hope disolved yhe moent heckerling underscored a sequence ofthe paul inwhich thge throes ofthe unrequited lveo tothe simon adn garfunkel
' s
" scarborough fair
/ canticle
.
" instade ofthe giving tyhe sequence a knowing wink
- a referecne tothe tjhe graduat
, a hint tyhat paul isnt becomming an overly
- senstive clich
- heckerling plays it deadly straight
. even inthe hte scenes tath scream fo a glight comic touch adn a bited ofthe a poke at her rotagonist
' s foibles
, she finds it impossible tothe stray fomr tjhe gospel ofthe paul as saint
. clueless
' s cher hadnt her self
- abosrption adn manipulative tendancies tothe balance her cuteness
. infront losr
, amy heckerling shows a leaden h
and wiht material thta dem
ands friskiness
( her noe sohw ofthe witn involves naming paul
' s dorm
" hunt
' s hall
" affter erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall
)
. her gitf wiht casting prooved tothe be her curse
. losr may be a crashing bore
, bu gee
, aren
' t thsoe twpo kids aswell
