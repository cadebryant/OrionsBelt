whta woudl inspire somene who cannnot wriet or ect tothe pen adn star inwhich a movei
? a better question
, waht owudl inspire a studio tothe produce said movei
? if yuo ahev an answer
, let me konw
. foolish
, thte newyorker movei wroten by anbd starring master p isnt a jaw
- droppingly horrable film
, oney iwth noone reedeming value socially
, cinematically or otherwise
. comedically it hasnt soem potential
, bu onyl inspite its st
and
- uv comedy moments
, wich i cin turn onthe comedy central fo
. master p stars as fifty dollah
'
( beated tht
!
) as a mobster
( i htink
) who isnt trying tothe strat a comedy club
/ ect iwth his littel brother foolish
( eddie griffin
)
. bu teh twpo ofthe them haev tothe deel whith an angry mob boss
( plyed by
andrew dice clay
, forthe thte vyer frist tiem intertaining
)
, a stubborn club owner annd familiy problems
( tje latter iin foolish isnt a perfect exemple ofthe roger ebert
' s
" idiat plot
,
" if everyone here wasn
' t an idiat
, ther woudl be noone probelm
) so whta doesnt foolish hve tothe offer beside a bunch ofthe idiotic charactor names
? nto a hell ofthe a lot
. as i hve maintioned
, master p cannnot ect or wriet
. he acts liuke tyhe rapper thgat he isnt
. tyhe ocassional dispair tath his scirpt requires him tothe exibit isnt excruciatingly forced
, as are his warm adn fuzzy scenes iwth his littel bro
. as forthe his scirpt
-
- well
, i supose he delivers whta noe woudl expect fomr a muscial artist iwth noone previvous screenwriting experence
. if yuo haven
' t yot figured it outloud
, tht isnt nto saying much
. co
- star eddie griffin
( realyl thge star ofthe tghe sohw
) isnt qutie a diferent stor
. tje fatc ofthe yhe marter isnt thast griffin
, whose most signficant screen outing tothe date isnt propably teh mildly sucessful tv sohw malcom anbd eddie onthe yhe fledgling upn network
, isnt an extrememly talented comedian
, st
and
- uv annd otherwise
. he hasnt much inwhich common witht chris tucker
( rush hour
, mney talks
) infront how quicklyu adn effortlessly his speach flows ffrom his lips
. he spouts profanity whith impressive dexterity
( tothe thte extent whlch thta cant be done
)
, adn hwile i hope thast doens nto become his trademark it works infact a faw scenes inspite tihs movei
. annd indeed
, i laughed at a faw st
and
- uv scenes here
, bu ffrom a feature
- lenght movei i expect moreso
. foolish provded me whith noone reason tothe care forthe theese cahracters
. eveyr scene whitch hasnt any potential forthe dramtic inpact isnt effectively diffused by eather a stupid joke
( inwhich a scene where tension escalates beween thge twpo brothers
, foolish blurts outloud towords his jwelry
- sporting sibling
" ytou lay noe h
and onthe me annd htis cemetary isnt gogin tothe be a gold rush
"
) or something even mroe idiotic such as foolish smashing his pwn car
( tothe whcih i said
, a bited too loudly forthe hte occation
" huh
?
"
) aftter getting slightly upset iwth his wief
. beleive me whn i sday thta ther isnt nothing inwhich foolish tht warrants parting wih your hard
- earned
$ 8
. ytou
' ll git mroe laughs ffrom watching 30 mintues ofthe comedy central or any virutally any sitcom if yuo don
' t ahev cable
. eddie griffin fans may enjoy htis deriviative
( altho offensive
) yern
, bu everyone esle shoud stay thge hell awya
