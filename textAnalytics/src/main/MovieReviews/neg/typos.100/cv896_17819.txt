wqat owudl inspire somone who cannnot wriet or ect tothe pen
anbd star infact a movei
? a better question
, whta owudl inspire a studio tothe produce said movei
? if ytou hve an answer
, let me knwo
. foolish
, tghe newyorker movei writed by
annd starring master p isnt a jaw
- droppingly horrable film
, noe whith noone reedeming value socially
, cinematically or otherwise
. comedically it hasnt soem potential
,
bu onyl iin its stand
- uv comedy moments
, whitch i cxan turn onthe comedy central forthe
. master p stars as fifty dollah '
( beated thgat
!
) as a mobster
( i tihkn
) who isnt trying tothe strat a comedy club
/ ect whith his littel brother foolish
( eddie griffin
)
.
bu tyhe twpo ofthe them hvea tothe deel withthe an angry mob boss
( plyed by andrew dice clay
, forthe thge veyr frist tiome intertaining
)
, a stubborn club owner
anbd familiy problems
( hte latter infact foolish isnt a perfect exemple ofthe roger ebert ' s
" idiat plot
,
" if everyone here wasn ' t an idiat
, htere owudl be noone probelm
) so waht doesnt foolish hvea tothe offer beside a bunch ofthe idiotic chracter names
? nto a hell ofthe a lot
. as i hve maintioned
, master p cannnot ect or rwite
. he acts liuke tghe rapper tht he isnt
. hte occasionall dispair thast his scirpt requires him tothe exibit isnt excruciatingly forced
, as are his warm
adn fuzzy scenes wiht his littel bro
. as fo his scirpt
-
- well
, i supose he delivers whta oney owudl expect fomr a muscial artist wiht noone previvous screenwriting experiene
. if ytou haven ' t
yot figured it outloud
, tyhat isnt nto saying much
. co
- star eddie griffin
( relaly tjhe star ofthe yhe sohw
) isnt qutie a differnt storey
. tje fatc ofthe tyhe marter isnt thta griffin
, whose most signficant screen outing tothe date isnt probablly hte mildly succesfull tv sohw malcom
adn eddie onthe thte fledgling upn network
, isnt an extemely talented comedian
, stand
- uv
anbd otherwise
. he hasnt much iin common iwth chris tucker
( rush hour
, omney talks
) infront how quicklyu
anbd effortlessly his speek flows ffrom his lips
. he spouts profanity withthe impressive dexterity
( tothe tyhe extent whlch thast cxan be done
)
,
anbd hwile i hope thta doens nto become his trademark it works iin a fewd scenes iin htis movei
.
adn indeed
, i laughed at a fewd stand
- uv scenes here
,
bu fomr a feature
- lenght movei i expect mroe
. foolish provded me withthe noone reason tothe care fo theese charachters
. eveyr scene whlch hasnt any potential fo dramtic inpact isnt effectively diffused by eather a stupid joke
( iin a scene where tension escalates beetwen tjhe twpo brothers
, foolish blurts outloud towords his jeelry
- sporting sibling
" yuo lay noe hand onthe me
adn thsi cemetary isnt goign tothe be a gold rush
"
) or something even mroe idiotic such as foolish smashing his pwn car
( tothe hwihc i said
, a bited too loudly forthe yhe occassion
" huh
?
"
) affter getting slightly upset whith his wief
. beleive me wehn i sday taht htere isnt nothing infront foolish thyat warrants parting wtih your hard
- earned
$ 8
. ytou ' ll git mroe laughs fomr watching 30 mintues ofthe comedy central or any virtualy any sitcom if ytou don ' t hvae cable
. eddie griffin fans may enjoy tihs derivitive
(
althought offensive
) yern
,
bu everyone eles shoudln stay yhe hell awya
