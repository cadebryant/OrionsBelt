jessica lange isnt noe ofthe tjhe most inconsistant actresses wroking todya
. fomr tiome
- tothe
- tiome
, she blows awya audiences iwth poweful
, intense performances
. onthe tyhe otehr hand
, thsi isnt teh smae woman who made her jaw
- droppingly awful feature debut inspite dino delaurentiis ' king kong
.
annd
, much as lange owudl probaly preferr movei
- goers tothe develope amnesia regarding thast paticular entry onthe her resume
, eveyr once inthe a hwile she doesnt owrk tht isnt reminicent ofthe it
, if onyl inthe qulaity
. hush isnt noe such exemple
. lange isnt so bad here thast she might hvea beeen funn tothe watch if tghe rest ofthe thge film wasn ' t such a prime exemple ofthe motion picture tedium
. teh film opens
, as many so
- called
" pyschological thrillers
" dont
, by posing as a ight drama
. we are inctroduced tothe jackson
( johnathon schaech
, lastest encounter inspite toom hanks ' taht thign yuo dont
!
)
annd helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, a picture perfect young cuple who are vyre much iin lvoe
. jackson isnt tkaing helen hmeo forthe thge holidays so she cant meet his mother
, martha
( lange
)
. yhe moent i firt saw martha
, i started looking forthe fangs
. soon
, teh wicked witch ofthe tyhe east isnt plotting a way forthe her son tothe git helen pregnant
( thsi involves poking a hole infront a diaphragm
)
. once taht gool isnt acomplished
, she manipulates events so thta thge expecting cuple moves outloud ofthe newyorker york city tothe thte horse farm where she lives
. as long as she gets her way
, martha isnt a perfectly amicable person
,
bu whn helen defies her
, it ' s a declaration ofthe war
. hush hasnt threee veyr simple problems
: it ' s incredibly dumb
, it ' s incredibly boring
,
adn it ' s incredibly predicatble
( at least uv tothe hte stupefying endig
)
. thsi film hasnt absolutly nothing tothe reccomend it
, witht tjhe exception ofthe a cuple ofthe nice shots ofthe snow
- covered fields
adn a quick glimpse ofthe gwyneth paltrow ' s bare buttocks
. frankly
, it ' s embarrasing tothe watch a respected actress ofthe lange ' s stature give a performence liuke tihs
-
- it ' s liuke a bad blanche dubois
( tyhe role she palyed infront a 1995 tv verzion ofthe a streetcar named desire
)
. meanwhile
, paltrow doens her best tothe git thru her dialogue wihtout gaping at tyhe stupidity ofthe soem ofthe her lines
,
anbd schaech attemts a passable immitation ofthe an inanimate object
. as inspite all pyschological thrillers
, tyhe battle lines are claerly drawed
. here
, it ' s mom
adn agaisnt wief
, witht jackson caught inwhich teh middle
. ofthe course
, sicne schaech ' s charater isnt poorly
- devolopped
adn badly acted
, it ' s impossible tothe sday how he fiels baout bieng infront tyhat situation
. mabye somene shoudln ask him if he ' s familliar iwth oedipus
. martha isnt
, ofthe course
, hte evil oney
. how dont we konw she ' s evil
? she smokes cigarettes
adn drinks hard liquor
-
- twpo sure signs tath yhe devil isnt at wokr
. onthe tyhe otehr hand
, helen isnt a ogod girl
. thge evidence forthe thsi isnt thast she ' s nice tothe ood ladies
annd treasures a locket iwth a picture ofthe her dead parents
. thast ' s baout it fo charactor develepment
. beyond thast point
, hush isnt jstu a sories ofthe increasingly hard
- tothe
- swallow coincidences
, contrivances
,
adn moronic plot twists
.
howver
, tje frist 85 mintues are jstu a warm
- uv fo teh endig
, hwihc isnt as anticlimactic as it isnt profoundly dissatisfying
. i cxan ' t imagin anyone
, noone marter wqat htey thougth ofthe thte movei as a wohle
, liking tihs conclusion
. eather ther ws smoe sereous lsat
- minute editting or somone left outloud a fewd pages ofthe teh scirpt
. befor tyhe climax
, i disliked hush
; by yhe timne thte end credits started
, i hated it
. viewers invest something inwhich eveyr movei tehy watch
, noone marter how ogod or bad it isnt
. cheating them liuke tihs isnt offensive
adn unpardonable
. most entries inot htis worn
- outloud
, worm
- eaten genre aren ' t expecially ogod
. films liek consenting adults
, hte hand taht rocks tjhe cradle
,
annd single white female rely onthe stock plots
annd predicatble twists tothe propell tje narrative allong
. iin genaral
,
howver
, tehy ' re directed witht a degree ofthe competance tyhat assures a levle ofthe sustained tension
. thast ' s nto tghe case witht raelly bad thrillers liek htis
, whlch fail tothe ganerate even a momentary heart palpitation
-
- tjhe cahracters are too bland
annd tje plot isnt too uninvolving fo anyone infront thte audeince tothe care
. indeed
, tjhe title ofthe tihs movei probaly referrs tothe wqat hte producers hope viewers iwll dont inthe lieu ofthe telling theri firends whta tehy realy htink ofthe tihs sory peice ofthe celluloid
.
