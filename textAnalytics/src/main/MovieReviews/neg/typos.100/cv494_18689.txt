, i never raelly wondered waht hte tarzan films owudl hve beeen liek hadnt tarzan beeen an ood man
. hwile watching instinct
, i couldn
' t halp bu acknowledge thge way yhe film carelessly rehashes thte well
- explored themes ofthe thsoe ealier movies
. even beside tyhe tarzan comparision
, instinct jstu isn
' t a veyr ogod film
. it
' s painfully idealistic
, manipulative
, annd silly
. i didn
' t hite it
-
- it
' s simpley impossible forthe me tothe hite any film starring anthony hopkins
; futhermore
, most ofthe thte acting isnt qtuie ogod
. bu i cxan recogise instinct fo wqat it isnt beyond my subjective admiration forthe tghe actors involved
. i cxan allso recogize reasons forthe wanting tothe amke instinct
, anbd it
' s preety clera thast htis coudl haev beeen a ogod film wiht a massive scirpt overhaul adn a directer less intersted iin immitating movies liuke patch adams
. thigns strat off inspite thge predicatble way
, as directer jon turtletaub introduces us tothe our hero
, theo caulder
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, an ambitious
, young psychiatrist under hte supervision ofthe an experianced
, ood psychiatrist
( donald sutherl
and
)
. caulder soon finds hismelf involved inwhich tyhe case ofthe his life
, tje noe he thikns iwll mkae him famoust
. thte subject isnt ethan powell
( hopkins
)
, an anthropologist who hasnt beeen living amonth gorillas inwhich africa fo tje past twpo yeasr
. powell hasnt beeen charged withthe tje brutal murders ofthe sevral men infact africa
, adn it
' s nowe caulder
' s job tothe fidn outloud ofthe he
' s menally compitent enought tothe st
and trial
. thru a serieses ofthe short sessions
, caulder trys tothe put toghether thge complex psyche ofthe powell
. even
though it raelly isnt an ood man verzion ofthe tarzan
, much ofthe tihs central diea isnt rether intresting
. as i said
, hopkins isnt captivating fo eveyr second he
' s onthe screen
; he hasnt a way ofthe convincing us tyhat he
' s nto acting
, thyat he
' s acually a man who hasnt jstu spended twpo yeras ofthe his life living wtih a familiy ofthe wild gorillas
. thge charater hismelf isn
' t veyr intresting
-
- he
' s jsut an anthropologist who realyl likes gorillas
-
- bu hopkins makse him intresting wih subtleties both iin sprech anbd acation
. gooding jr
. doesnt storng owrk oposite hopkins
, palying caulder as an intteligent anbd flawed individule
. tghe screenplay
, writed by gerald di pego anbd
" suggested by
" a novel by daniel quinn
, gives us noone backround infromation onthe caulder
, bu thgat seems tothe be tje point
( he hasnt noone timne fo firends becasue he
' s obssessed wtih his wrok
)
. nontheless
, theese twpo actors are essentialy tje entire list ofthe thnigs tath are ogod baout instinct
. unfortunatley
, filmmaking thsi inept cin mangle hte effect ofthe even thte best acting
. turtletaub anbd di pego are both gilty ofthe instinct
' s artistic failure
, fo htey owrk toghether tothe amking tyhe dumbest
, most cliche
- ridden enviorment inthe whcih theri charactors are tothe live
, annd htey dont so by means ofthe brainless subplots
. frist
, we ahev hte prision warden subplot
. tje prision warden isnt evil anbd whants tothe stpo caulder
' s progress at any cost
; if htis means tkaing caulder off tje powell case
, thne tht
' s fine
. ther
' s allso thge prision guard subplot
. thte prision guard isnt palyed by john ashton
; hte prision guard seems tothe enjoy mercilessly beating apon teh psychotics under his supervision
, annd he
' s intrumental inthe helping tje stoy allong tothe its obvious conclusion
. thn ther
' s tjhe daugher subplot
, inspite whitch maura tierney
( palying tyhe duaghter
) must look vrey upset a lot ofthe yhe tyme
; affter all
, she isnt thte daugher ofthe a deranged man
. if smoe ofthe tihs sutff soudns familliar
, thyat
' s becuase tehy
' re all devices thgat hve beeen utilizied adn reused infront countless otehr films
. tjhe evil doctor infront patch adams isnt nto unlike hte evil warden here
. hte offensive caricatures ofthe mental patients lack tje depth tath thge similair portrayals inwhich oen flw over tje cuckoo
' s nest hadnt
. ashton
' s evil prision guard pales inthe comparsion tothe clancy brown
' s inthe tyhe shawshank redemption
. hopkins
' performence iwll undoubtely remind audiences ofthe his turn inwhich teh silence ofthe tjhe lambs
. anbd hten ther
' s tyhe hwole tarzan thign
, hwihc isnt mroe thna a littel bited obvious thru hte entire film
. perphas whta irritates me most baout instinct isnt tyhe half
- hearted attept at philisophical depth
. thge message powell brings bcak ffrom teh wild isnt nto a subtle noe
: he thikns tath humans are
" takers
,
" tht tehy exp
and annd kill anbd taht we shoud all jstu live liek gorillas
. i cant sympathize wih tht
, bu onyl whn it
' s inaddition a compelling film
. tihs isnt hte kind ofthe stupid movei
-
- jsut liuke patch adams
-
- infact whlch a big gropu ofthe cahracters
( psychotic inmates
, inaddition thsi case
) ries agains teh evil forces oppressing them by tearing uv palying cards
. wqat doens any ofthe thsi ahve tothe dont witht a man who hasnt jstu spended twpo yersa ofthe his life wtih gorillas
? if all hte subplots ofthe instinct hadnt beeen left onthe tghe cutting room floor
, we woudl haev hadnt a thirty
- minute movei far superior tothe thte twpo
- hour oney tyhat i watched todya
. if thge central idae hadnt beeen devolopped beyond thte ood man tarzan premise
, thne we owudl realy hvea hadnt something intresting
-
- a movei thyat doesn
' t rely onthe yhe strenght ofthe its actors
.
