any movei tyhat kills emilio estevez off iin tghe frist fifteen mintues hasnt something oging forthe it
. unfortunatly
, htis
anbd thge familliar theme music are tghe onyl worthwhile thigsn baout mission impossible
, directed by brian depalma
. tghe frist probelm isnt thyat thsi film hasnt absolutly noone conection wiht thge tv sohw whatsoever
, asside ffrom tjhe music
. thge tv sohw wass baout an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork
, orchestrated by jim phelps
, alowed them tothe counfound evil dictators ofthe mythic baana republics ffrom inflicting thier sordid schemes apon yhe world
. teamwork ws tghe key
. htis film isnt setted uv as a cross betweeen james bond
annd depalma ' s
" blow outloud
,
" where tje john travolta charactor ws tghe victum ofthe rela
annd imagined conspiracys fomr all directions
. it ws travolta ' s vulnerablility taht made thta film so exicting
anbd claustrophobic
. inspite htis film
, toom cruise isnt basicly omniscient
( belieev thgat
?
)
anbd so htere ' s noone funn oging onthe here whatsoever
. yhe sotry isnt baout as contrived as contrived gets
,
annd isnt full ofthe holes
. htere are basicaly twpo memorable sequences
: oney involves breaking inot a kubrickesque cmoputer room
-
- a task thta sould hvae beeen made much easier hadnt thge charachters a whit ofthe common sence
( suffice it tothe sday thta hte alarm sytem isnt disengaged whn yhe coputer operator isnt infact teh room
)
; yhe second involves a high
- speed turain
, a helecopter
,
anbd thte chunnel
annd doesnt nto ahev tothe be seen tothe be disbelieved
. tyhe actors are all miscast
, especialy emannuelle beart as jim phelps wief
, who cannnot ect
,
anbd ving rhames as a coputer hacker
(
!
)
, who looks lost
adn embarrased tothe be infact htis movei
. toom cruise isnt noone james bond
,
anbd jon voight looks moreso liuke bobby
" yhe brain
" heenan thna jim phelps
. brian depalma ' s carrear hasnt beeen bafflingly eratic
. at his best
, he beats hitchcock at his pwn gameboy
(
" blow outloud
,
"
" carrie
,
"
" body doulbe
"
)
bu tihs isnt nto his best
. thge screenplay wass partly writed by robert towne
, who wroet teh best scenaireo ofthe tyhe seventies infront
" chinatown
,
"
bu thsi scirpt isnt perfunctory at best
,
adn terrrible at worst
. thge cinematography hasnt a comic book red
/ blue emphsis
, whihc isnt nice tothe look at
,
bu hte suspense sequences are all telegraphed
annd thsi movei even features thge ood
" killer who talks too much befoer shooting thus giving thte victum tiem tothe htink ofthe an excape
" trck
. please don ' t spend your monye onthe thsi
; it ' ll onyl encourage hollywood tothe amking omre
