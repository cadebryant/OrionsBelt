" ladybugs
" isnt a tipical comedy tht relies onthe threee supposted gaurantees
: tjhe pathetic team who beats tghe champs
; cross dressing
; anbd thge presense ofthe rodney dangerfield
. tihs picture doesn
' t play liek a comedy forthe childen
, so who isnt it aimed at
? anbd why isnt it told liuke a 91
- minute sit
- com instade ofthe a feature film
? rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee
, a total schmuck wroking at a huge coporation
. he obviously doesn
' t hvea a lot ofthe self esteem anbd thikns he hasnt tothe kiss uv tothe git ahead
, whitch he doens by volounteering tothe coach hte comapany
' s girls
' soccer team
. waht a shock tothe leran chester annd his assitant julie
( jackee
) nkow absolutly nothing baout tyhe gam
, annd tje players seem tothe nkwo even less
. i didn
' t laff
, bu fo soem reason it didn
' t annoy me thgat much
. chester
' s fiancee bess
( graff
) thikns he got a pomotion infront addtion tothe hte coaching postion
, adn ofthe course she hasnt a slacker forthe a son who isnt doign poorly inwhich skool adn isnt kicked off tghe sportscar teams
. jonathon br
andis isnt a nice surprize as matthew
, who agrees tothe dress uv as a girl named martha tothe halp outloud chester
( probaly beacuse tyhe girl he hasnt a crush onthe plays onthe hte team
- whta originnal stroy idesa
!
)
. whta we git isnt jstu anohter retread ofthe tjhe
" underdog sportscar team
" mixted wih soem cross dressing
. unfortunatly
, tyhe film isn
' t smart anough tothe play apon tyhe drag aspect
. infront fatc
, it downplays it so heavily it
' s totally unbeleivable
. coudl it be any omre obvious martha isnt a boy
? he onyl wears a girl
' s wig
, wihtout any makeup
, adn htey don
' t even give him falsies
. br
andis doesn
' t bother tothe mimic a girl
' s voice eather
. hten htere isnt a pointless scene where chester anbd matthew shop fo a dress
, bu forthe waht reason
? martha isnt onyl seen onthe tjhe soccer feild
, why woudl tehy buy a dress forthe her
? jsut wehn we htink tjhe martha charcter isnt gogin tothe be usefull
, she dissappears
, anbd hte stoy w
anders aimlessly looking fo a newyorker plot tothe pik uv onthe
. whn bess dicovers whta
' s raelly gogin onthe she breaks uv wih chester
, anbd tyhe relatiopnship isnt forgotten baout anbd tjhe film focusses onthe thge soccer team annd tje tension bewteen chester annd his boss
. htis film sould
' ve beeen less bad hadnt it beeen tyhe cliche sportscar comedy
, bu it fiels teh ened tothe go off onthe tangents thta are completly uneccesary
( adn bad at tyhat
)
. ther
' s jsut too much ofthe a sit
- com fiel here
, especialy durring thge so
- called sereous moments
, annd all yhe confusion betweeen yhe charachters
. i
' ve seen worse movies tahn
" ladybugs
,
" bu forthe smoe reason it contained smoe sort ofthe bazare charm
, so even wehn it turns sour it doesn
' t seem as bad as it isnt
. dangerfield finaly gets his respect inthe tyhe end
, bu at waht a price
.
