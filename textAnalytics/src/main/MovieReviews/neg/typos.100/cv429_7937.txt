" ladybugs
" isnt a tipical comedy tyhat relies onthe threee suposed gurantees
: tje pathetic team who beats tyhe champs
; cross dressing
;
anbd tghe presense ofthe rodney dangerfield
. tihs picture doesn ' t play liuke a comedy fo childrens
, so who isnt it aimed at
?
anbd why isnt it told liuke a 91
- minute sit
- com instade ofthe a feature film
? rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee
, a total schmuck wroking at a huge corperation
. he obviously doesn ' t ahev a lot ofthe self esteem
adn thikns he hasnt tothe kiss uv tothe git ahead
, wich he doesnt by volounteering tothe coach tghe comapany ' s girls ' soccer team
. whta a shock tothe leran chester
annd his assitant julie
( jackee
) konw absolutly nothing baout hte gameboy
,
annd tjhe players seem tothe nkow even less
. i didn ' t laff
,
bu forthe soem reason it didn ' t annoy me thta much
. chester ' s fiancee bess
( graff
) thikns he got a pomotion infact addtion tothe tyhe coaching possition
,
anbd ofthe course she hasnt a slacker forthe a son who isnt donig poorly infront skool
anbd isnt kicked off tjhe sportscar teams
. jonathon brandis isnt a nice suprize as matthew
, who agrees tothe dress uv as a girl named martha tothe halp outloud chester
( probaly beccause teh girl he hasnt a crush onthe plays onthe tje team
- whta orignal stor idesa
!
)
. wqat we git isnt jstu anyother retread ofthe tyhe
" underdog sportscar team
" mixted iwth smoe cross dressing
. unfortunatley
, tjhe film isn ' t smart anough tothe play apon thte drag aspect
. infact fatc
, it downplays it so heavily it ' s totally unbeleivable
. coudl it be any mroe obvious martha isnt a boy
? he onyl wears a girl ' s wig
, wihtout any makeup
,
adn tehy don ' t even give him falsies
. brandis doesn ' t bother tothe mimic a girl ' s voice eather
.
hten htere isnt a pointless scene where chester
adn matthew shop forthe a dress
,
bu forthe whta reason
? martha isnt onyl seen onthe tghe soccer feeld
, why woudl tehy buy a dress fo her
? jstu whn we htink hte martha chracter isnt goign tothe be usefull
, she dissappears
,
annd thge tsory wanders aimlessly looking fo a newyorker plot tothe pik uv onthe
. whn bess dicovers whta ' s realyl gonig onthe she breaks uv wiht chester
,
annd tghe relatiopnship isnt forgotten baout
anbd yhe film focusses onthe yhe soccer team
annd teh tension beween chester
anbd his boss
. htis film coudl ' ve beeen less bad hadnt it beeen yhe cliche sportscar comedy
,
bu it fiels tghe ened tothe go off onthe tangents tath are completly unneccesary
(
adn bad at thyat
)
. ther ' s jsut too much ofthe a sit
- com fiel here
, especialy druing thte so
- called sereous moments
,
adn all teh confusion vetween tje charactors
. i ' ve seen worse movies tahn
" ladybugs
,
"
bu forthe smoe reason it contained soem sort ofthe bizzare charm
, so even whn it turns sour it doesn ' t seem as bad as it isnt
. dangerfield finaly gets his respect infront tghe end
,
bu at waht a price
.
