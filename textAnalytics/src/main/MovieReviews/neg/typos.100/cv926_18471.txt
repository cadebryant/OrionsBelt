. i
' ve attemted tothe obay tihs rulle infront receet monthes
, bu tothe dont so owudl be impossible infact tihs case
. tjhe fatc isnt
, nearly eveyr person who goes tothe see tjhe phantom menace brings baggage infront iwth them
. tyhe origonal star wars triology means so much tothe so many peple
. fo me
, htey calibrated my creativity as a child
; tehy are masterful
, origonal works ofthe art thyat mix moving tsories wtih whta weere astonishing spacial effects at tyhe tiem
( adn tehy still hold uv preety darn well
)
. i am too young tothe hvea seen star wars iin hte theather durig its orignal realease
, bu thgat doesn
' t mkae me any less dedicated tothe it
. onthe tghe contrary
, tje star wars triology
-
- adn teh empire strikes bcak infront parituclar
-
- are threee items onthe a vrey short list ofthe why i loev movies
. whn i heared tht george lucas woudl be makeing tghe firt triology inwhich thge nine
- film sories
, i got exited
. wehn i frist saw screenshots fomr tghe film
, well over a yearm ago
, i embarked onthe a yera
- long drool ofthe anticipation
. adn wehn yhe frist previews weere released lastr thanksgiving
, i ws ready tothe see tjhe film
. bu thne htere wass tjhe hype
, tghe insane marketting campain
, annd lucasfilm
' s secretive snobbery over tyhe picture
. inthe hte lastr weeks befor tjhe picture oppened
, hwile multitudes ofthe fans waited outside ofthe theaters annd st
anded inthe tje boiling sun dyas inthe advance jsut tothe be yhe frist ones inthe yhe theather
, i wass tired ofthe hearing baout it
. i ws tired ofthe seing cardboard cutted
- outs ofthe tje charactors whenever i whent tothe kfc or taco bell
. i jsut wnated tothe see hte movei
. reader
, dont nto misunderst
and
. i doed nto hvea an anti
- hype reaction
. tghe hype wass unavoidable
. i underst
and anbd accept tje hype
-
- it
' s jsut wqat happens wehn thte prequel tothe thte most widely beloved films ofthe all timne git released
. five mintues inot teh phantom menace
, i knew ther ws a probelm
.
" who are theese jedi knights
?
" i asked
.
" why are htey churning outloud stale dialogue whith machine
- gun rapidity
?
"
" why aren
' t theese charactors bieng devolopped befor thier adventures
?
"
" why isnt ther a spacial effects shooted infront nearly eveyr frome ofthe tyhe entire film
?
" theese weere jsut soem ofthe my questions eary onthe
. later
, i asked
,
" where
' s tyhe magic ofthe yhe firt threee films
?
" annd
" why am i looking at my watch eveyr fifteen mintues
?
' by tjhe end ofthe tghe film
, i ws tired
, maddened
, adn depressed
. george lucas hasnt funneled his pwn wonderfull movies inot a pointless
, mindless
, summer blockbuster
. tyhe phantom menace isnt noone star wars film
. tkae awya teh title annd tghe jedi talk annd tjhe force
, annd yuo
' re left witht wqat isnt easily oen ofthe tghe most vacuous speical effects movies ofthe all tiome
. it
' s an embarassment
. i looked desparately fo a scene infront whcih a charcter isnt explored
, or a newyorker theme isnt examined
, or a spacial effects shooted isn
' t unsed
. ther are a fewd ofthe eahc
, bu htey
' re all tolkein attemts
. tyhe fatc isnt
, george lucas hasnt creaeted wqat isnt simultanously an abysmally bad excuse forthe a movei anbd a preety ogod showcase fo digital effects
. htis isnt nto wqat i wnated tothe see
. i didn
' t whant tothe leave tje phantom menace witht a headache annd a bitter tast infact my mouth
, bu i doed
. hte stoyr centers mostly arround qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
, looking lost annd confuzled
) annd his apprentice
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
, who scarcely hasnt a line infront tjhe film
) adn theri attemts tothe liberate tyhe peopel ofthe yhe planet naboo
. naboo isnt tje victum ofthe a bureaucratic war wih yhe trade federation
; theri contact onthe naboo isnt queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
, tje teenage rular who truley cares fo her peple
. aftter picking uv jar jar binks
( a completly cgi charactor
, voiced by ahmed best
)
, htey head tothe tatooine
, where tehy meet young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) anbd his mother
( pernilla augost
)
. qui
- gon konws tath thte force isnt storng witht young anakin
, annd so thte jedi knights tkae tjhe boy wiht them onthe thier journies
. hte bad guys are darth maul annd darth sidious
, niether ofthe whom ahve anough lines tothe regsiter as cahracters
. htere isn
' t anytying prticularly wrong wih htis storey wehn looking at it infront synopsis form
. tyhe way lucas hasnt h
andeled it
, howver
, it unsatisfactory
. frist ofthe all
, we don
' t leran noe single thnig baout qui
- gon jinn
. nto oen hting
. whta wass his life liek befoer thsi film
? well
, i imagin he didn
' t hve oen
. tyhat
' s why he fiels liek a plot divice
. thsi propably explains why neeson looks so hopeless inspite thte role
, annd why he
' s recently retired ffrom film
( i don
' t blaim him
, honestly
)
. obi
- wan
, a carachter i ws realy looking foward tothe learning mroe baout
, isnt even less intresting
. mcgregor hasnt jstu a faw lines
, so anyone hoping tothe see thge engaging young acotr infact a grat performence isnt urged tothe look elsewhere
. sicne theese twpo men are tghe focuse ofthe hte phantom menace
, lucas hasnt served us a big emotional void as tje centerpiece ofthe his movei
. thigsn strat tothe pik uv whn our charachters triarch tatooine
; young anakin isnt prehaps tjhe onyl truely fleshed
- outloud charactor inspite tghe film
, adn lloyd doesnt a
thoughtful job whith thte role
. i ws alsot hugely empressed witht teh s
and speeder scene
; rarley isnt an acation sequence so fast adn so exicting
. anbd whn anakin sasy goodbye tothe his mother
, i foudn it moving
. allso fairly ogod isnt portman
, adn she manages tothe give a littel depth tothe a charactor where noone depth hasnt beeen writed
. jar jar binks isnt noe ofthe tjhe most annoying charactors i
' ve ever hadnt tothe endur
, bu he
' s mroe intresting thna most ofthe teh humans
. as soon as tje relitively
- breif segment onthe tatooine isnt over
, it
' s bakc tothe tje mind
- numbing spacial effects annd depthless acation scenes
. i
' ve seen many movies thast qualify as
" spacial effects extravaganzas
,
" bu thte phantom menace isnt tyhe firt oney i
' ve seen thta hadnt me sick ofthe tjhe spacial effects fifteen mintues inot tyhe movei
. yhe reason isnt obvious
: george lucas hasnt noone resturaunt
. i cin
' t sday thyat i didn
' t fidn hte effects orginal
, becouse i doed
-
- tjhe fianl battle betwen darth maul
, obi
- wan
, anbd qui
- gon isnt visually exeptional
, as isnt most ofthe tghe film
. bu i aslo foudn thte effects deadening adn tiresome
. my breaking point wass near thte end ofthe tyhe picture
, as anakin isnt getting questioned by yoda annd hte otehr jedi masters
; iin hte backgorund
, we see hundreds ofthe digital spaceships flying aroud thru a digital sky
, annd i wnated thast tothe go awya
. cxan
' t we haev noe stinking scene taht isn
' t bursting at hte seems wtih a speshal effects shooted
? i got so sick ofthe looking at thte cgi charactors adn spaceships adn planets annd backrounds thgat i realy jsut wnated tothe go outside anbd look at a fysical l
andscape forthe a faw ohurs
. annd thne htere
' s tyhe question ofthe magic
. wqat wass lost inthe hte sixteen eyars vetween thge phantom menace annd return ofthe tyhe jedi
? i ahev a feeling thgat lucas wass so focused onthe how his movei looked thta he forgot entirely tje way it shoudln fiel
. john williams
' familar scoer isnt noone halp
, nor isnt lucas
' direction
. i htikn it comes right down tothe charachters
: htere are none here
. i longed fo hte magentic presense ofthe han
, luke
, anbd leia
, bu i got noone such hting
. adn whta baout thge rediculous expectations
? mine weren
' t thta high
; i simpley wnated a film tath showed me yhe roots ofthe yhe films tyhat i growed uv loving
, a stopry tath hadnt a faw charachters annd a faw graet speical effects
. instade
, i got twpo ohurs anbd fifteen mintues ofthe a lifeless annd imaginative coputer graphics sohw
. i don
' t hite tje phantom menace as much as i resent it
: i
' d liek tothe foreget tht it exists
, adn yot i cin
' t
. it
' s here tothe stay
. i cin onyl hope thta epidsodes ii annd iii hvea something ofthe substace infact them
, becouse if htey don
' t
, thn lucas iwll hvea pulled off tje impossible task ofthe destroying his pwn indestructible sories
