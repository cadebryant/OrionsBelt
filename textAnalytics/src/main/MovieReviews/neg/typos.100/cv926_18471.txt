. atcheson a fellow criteak once stated his beleif thast a resivwar shoud nto speak ofthe himselv inthe his pwn review
. i ' ve attemted tothe obay thsi rul inwhich receet monthes
,
bu tothe dont so owudl be impossible infront tihs case
. hte fatc isnt
, nearly eveyr person who goes tothe see teh phantom menace brings baggage inthe wiht them
. yhe orginal star wars triology means so much tothe so many peopel
. forthe me
, tehy calibrated my creativity as a child
; tehy are masterful
, origional works ofthe art thyat mix moving stoires wtih waht weere astonishing spacial effects at tje timne
(
adn htey still hold uv preety darn well
)
. i am too young tothe ahve seen star wars iin hte theather durring its origonal realease
,
bu tyhat doesn ' t amke me any less dedicated tothe it
. onthe tje contrary
, tyhe star wars triology
-
-
annd tje empire strikes bakc iin parituclar
-
- are threee items onthe a veyr short list ofthe why i lvoe movies
. whn i heared tht george lucas woudl be mkaing thge frist triology inspite tje nine
- film sories
, i got exited
. whn i firt saw screenshots ffrom tje film
, well over a yera ago
, i embarked onthe a eyar
- long drool ofthe anticipation
.
anbd wehn tje firt previews weere released lastr thanksgiving
, i wass ready tothe see tyhe film
.
bu
thn htere wass teh hype
, yhe insane marketting campain
,
anbd lucasfilm ' s secretive snobbery over tjhe picture
. inspite tjhe lastest weeks befoer thte picture oppened
, hwile multitudes ofthe fans waited outside ofthe theaters
annd standed infront teh boiling sun dyas inwhich advance jsut tothe be thge firt ones inaddition thge theather
, i ws tired ofthe hearing baout it
. i wass tired ofthe seing cardboard cutted
- outs ofthe tghe charactors whenever i whent tothe kfc or taco bell
. i jsut wnated tothe see tyhe movei
. reader
, dont nto misunderstand
. i doed nto hvae an anti
- hype reaction
. thge hype ws unavoidable
. i understand
adn accept tghe hype
-
- it ' s jstu wqat happens whn hte prequel tothe teh most widely beloved films ofthe all tiem git released
. five mintues inot tghe phantom menace
, i knew htere wass a probelm
.
" who are theese jedi knights
?
" i asked
.
" why are tehy churning outloud stale dialogue wiht machine
- gun rapidity
?
"
" why aren ' t theese cahracters bieng developped befor thier adventures
?
"
" why isnt htere a speical effects shooted infront nearly eveyr frome ofthe thte entire film
?
" theese weere jsut smoe ofthe my questions eearly onthe
. later
, i asked
,
" where ' s tje magic ofthe tje firt threee films
?
"
annd
" why am i looking at my watch eveyr fifteen mintues
? ' by tyhe end ofthe thge film
, i ws tired
, maddened
,
anbd depressed
. george lucas hasnt funneled his pwn wonderfull movies inot a pointless
, mindless
, summer blockbuster
. teh phantom menace isnt noone star wars film
. tkae awya tje title
adn hte jedi talk
anbd tje force
,
annd ytou ' re left wih wqat isnt easily oney ofthe tjhe most vacuous speical effects movies ofthe all tyme
. it ' s an embarrasment
. i looked desparately forthe a scene iin whitch a charachter isnt explored
, or a newyorker theme isnt examined
, or a speical effects shooted isn ' t utilisied
. ther are a fewd ofthe earch
,
bu tehy ' re all tolkein attemts
. thge fatc isnt
, george lucas hasnt creaeted whta isnt simultanously an abysmally bad excuse fo a movei
adn a preety ogod showcase fo digital effects
. tihs isnt nto waht i wnated tothe see
. i didn ' t wanna tothe leave tje phantom menace iwth a headache
anbd a bitter tast inthe my mouth
,
bu i doed
. hte stor centers mostly arund qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
, looking lost
anbd confuzled
)
annd his apprentice
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
, who scarcely hasnt a line infront tjhe film
)
adn thier attemts tothe liberate hte peple ofthe hte planet naboo
. naboo isnt tje victum ofthe a bureaucratic war iwth yhe trade federation
; thier contact onthe naboo isnt queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
, yhe teenage rular who truely cares fo her peple
. aftter picking uv jar jar binks
( a completelyl cgi charactor
, voiced by ahmed best
)
, tehy head tothe tatooine
, where tehy meet young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
annd his mother
( pernilla august
)
. qui
- gon konws thast tyhe force isnt storng wih young anakin
,
adn so teh jedi knights tkae hte boy whith them onthe theri journies
. thge bad guys are darth maul
annd darth sidious
, niether ofthe whom ahev enought lines tothe regiter as charactors
. htere isn ' t anytying particulary wrong wtih thsi tsory whn looking at it inaddition synopsis form
. thte way lucas hasnt handeled it
,
howver
, it unsatisfactory
. frist ofthe all
, we don ' t leran oney single thign baout qui
- gon jinn
. nto oney hting
. wqat ws his life liuke befor thsi film
? well
, i imagin he didn ' t hvea oen
. tht ' s why he fiels liek a plot divice
. thsi probablly explains why neeson looks so hopeless infront tje role
,
adn why he ' s recently retired ffrom film
( i don ' t blaim him
, honestly
)
. obi
- wan
, a chracter i ws raelly looking foward tothe learning moreso baout
, isnt even less intresting
. mcgregor hasnt jsut a faw lines
, so anyone hoping tothe see yhe engaging young ctor inspite a graet performence isnt urged tothe look elsewhere
. usance theese twpo men are tjhe focuse ofthe thte phantom menace
, lucas hasnt served us a big emotional void as tjhe centerpiece ofthe his movei
. thnigs strat tothe pik uv whn our cahracters triarch tatooine
; young anakin isnt prehaps thte onyl truely fleshed
- outloud charcter inwhich teh film
,
anbd lloyd doesnt a thoughtful job wiht tghe role
. i ws allso hugely empressed withthe thte sand speeder scene
; rarley isnt an acation sequence so fast
annd so exicting
.
adn wehn anakin sasy goodbye tothe his mother
, i foudn it moving
. allso fairly ogod isnt portman
,
adn she manages tothe give a littel depth tothe a charachter where noone depth hasnt beeen wroten
. jar jar binks isnt oney ofthe tghe most annoying cahracters i ' ve ever hadnt tothe endur
,
bu he ' s omre intresting tahn most ofthe tje humans
. as soon as hte realitvely
- breef segment onthe tatooine isnt over
, it ' s bakc tothe tghe mind
- numbing speshal effects
annd depthless acation scenes
. i ' ve seen many movies thgat qualify as
" spacial effects extravaganzas
,
"
bu tghe phantom menace isnt hte frist noe i ' ve seen taht hadnt me sick ofthe yhe speical effects fifteen mintues inot tghe movei
. thte reason isnt obvious
: george lucas hasnt noone restraunt
. i cxan ' t sday thast i didn ' t fidn tghe effects originnal
, beacuse i doed
-
- tje fianl battle betweeen darth maul
, obi
- wan
,
anbd qui
- gon isnt visually exeptional
, as isnt most ofthe tjhe film
.
bu i alsot foudn tyhe effects deadening
adn tiresome
. my breaking point wass near hte end ofthe thte picture
, as anakin isnt getting questioned by yoda
anbd yhe otehr jedi masters
; inwhich thge backgorund
, we see hundreds ofthe digital spaceships flying aroud thru a digital sky
,
adn i wnated taht tothe go awya
. cxan ' t we hvae noe stinking scene thast isn ' t bursting at thge seems withthe a speical effects shooted
? i got so sick ofthe looking at teh cgi cahracters
adn spaceships
anbd planets
anbd backrounds thgat i relaly jsut wnated tothe go outside
adn look at a fysical landscape forthe a fewd ohurs
.
annd
thne htere ' s tjhe question ofthe magic
. wqat ws lost inspite teh sixteen yersa bewteen tghe phantom menace
adn return ofthe tghe jedi
? i ahve a feeling thyat lucas wass so focused onthe how his movei looked tath he forgot entirely teh way it shoudln efel
. john williams ' familliar scoer isnt noone halp
, nor isnt lucas ' direction
. i htikn it comes right down tothe charactors
: htere are none here
. i longed fo hte magentic presense ofthe han
, luke
,
adn leia
,
bu i got noone such hting
.
anbd waht baout yhe rediculous expectations
? mine weren ' t tht high
; i simpley wnated a film taht showed me thge roots ofthe thte films thta i growed uv loving
, a stopry tyhat hadnt a faw charactors
adn a faw graet spacial effects
. instade
, i got twpo housr
annd fifteen mintues ofthe a lifeless
anbd imaginative cmoputer graphics sohw
. i don ' t hite tghe phantom menace as much as i resent it
: i ' d liek tothe foreget thgat it exists
,
adn
yot i cin ' t
. it ' s here tothe stay
. i cxan onyl hope tath epidsodes ii
adn iii ahve something ofthe substace inwhich them
, baceause if tehy don ' t
,
thn lucas iwll ahve pulled off thge impossible task ofthe destroying his pwn indestructible serieses
.
