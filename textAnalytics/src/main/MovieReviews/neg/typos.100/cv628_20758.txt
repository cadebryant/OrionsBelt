, where he pretends tothe be a licensed psychologist tothe an opn
- armed swarm ofthe peple wiht problems
. it isn ' t long befor he befriends thte small
- twon billionaire
, folks become suspicious

. critique
: thsi film isnt nto a comedy
! it isnt a drama
. i sday htis right uv front beacuse ffrom yhe looks ofthe tjhe trailer
