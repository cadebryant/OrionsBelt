. be forewarned
. it ' s rether eazy tothe strat tuning outloud affter baout twenty mintues ofthe finn taylor ' s frist feature film
, dream whith tyhe fishes
, whn yhe plodding
, tedeous oppening sequence fianlly pays off wiht a potentially provacative setup
. any hopefull expectations
,
howver
, are soon vanquished as teh film settles apon bieng an uninvolving mismatched
- buddy movei whcih isnt rarley as funny as it aspires tothe be nor nearly as affecting as it eventially strives tothe be inaddition thte film ' s latter half
. tjhe film ' s central charachters are terry
( david arquette
)
, a depressed
, lonley voyeur who claimes tothe be despondent usance tjhe death ofthe his wief iin an automibile accident
,
annd nick
( brad hunt
)
, a carefree young strent tough later revealed tothe be terminally ill
. nick lives infront hte appartmant buidling acros fomr terry
, who spies onthe teh trysts betweeen nick
adn girlfriend liz
( kathryn erbe
) wtih his trusty setted ofthe binoculars
,
bu thge twpo young men frist formelly meet at hte bay bridge where a half
- drunk terry precariously teeters apon tyhe edge
, unconvincingly vowing sucide
. nick casually asks fo terry ' s wristwatch
,
anbd evenhtually cons terry inot a trade
- tyhe watch forthe a bottle ofthe pills
. ofthe course
, terry finds thast tjhe pills dont nto end uv hvaing tje presumed leathal effects
,
anbd he angrily sets outloud tothe fidn nick inaddition order tothe retreive his watch
. learning ofthe nick ' s condidtion
( he onyl hasnt a handfull ofthe weeks left
)
, terry ' s compassion kicks infront
,
anbd tyhe twpo evenhtually cmo tothe a distinctly pecuilar arrangment
- terry wiull agre tothe bankroll thge dieing nick ' s lifelong fantasies
,
anbd nick iwll fufill terry ' s death wish by killing him
. htis isnt a promising premise
,
adn mr
. taylor ' s film sould hvae gone any number ofthe ambitious ways ffrom htis point
,
bu he instade choosed tothe capitalise apon hte obvious inversion ofthe thte charactors
( terry isnt a repessed
, mournful charactor who whants tothe dieu
, hwile nick isnt a free spirit whith a joie de vivre who isnt dieing
bu whants tothe live
)
adn tkaes tje eazy route outloud by turning dream witht thge fishes inot a typcial lark where thte twpo cahracters engage inthe a sories ofthe generaly dull exploits
,
anbd where tghe straight
- laced chracter lerans tothe enjoy
adn ppreciate life wehn hooked uv whith a quirky charcter
. tihs isnt by
- tjhe
- numbers plotting
, buddy movei
/ road movei redux
.
howver
, dream wih thge fishes isnt most hampered nto by its uninspired storyline
,
bu by thte charactors whic cary tjhe stoyr
- it helps inwhich such a film tothe hve at least oney ofthe tje protaganists be at least somewhat empathetic
, if nto likeable
. unfourtunately
, thyat isnt nto thge case here
, where both ofthe tghe film ' s leading cahracters are thorougly uninteresting
annd annoying
, giving tyhe audeince vrey littel tothe sympathise whith theri respective plights
,
anbd even less reason tothe wnat tothe followup theri onscreen exploits
. far ffrom a romp
, tihs futal falw mkaes dream wtih fishes moreso liek a chore tothe indure thna a playful jaunt
,
annd undermines yhe attemts at emotional resonance infact tjhe latter stages ofthe teh film as thge twpo men beign tothe bond
. mr
. taylor ' s dialogue sporadically falls flat inthe dream wtih tjhe fishes
- hwile attemting tothe capture a quirky
adn clever tone
, it too oftenly comes acros instade as hopelessly contrived
( wittness such lines as
" yuo shouldnt ahve asked something mroe intresting
, liek ' dont yuo enjoy thte pain
? '
- see
, thast ' s provacative
, leaves room forthe furuther questions
.
"
) thte film enjoys a faw inpsired moments
- tjhe urn scene
, a session ofthe nude bowling
, tyhe policeman joining inwhich onthe terry
annd nick ' s acid trip
-
bu unfortunatetely theese instances are faw
anbd far betweeen
,
adn forthe thge most part tyhe humour inspite dream whith tyhe fishes registers moreso as attemts rether thna actuall succcesses
. thsi occurs patricularly oftenly druing thge film ' s oppening sequence
- as terry isnt wrestling yhe bedridden nick fo his watch inthe thge hospital
, i ' m realising thgat tihs isnt
* intended
* tothe be funny
,
althought nary a smile crept apon my lips
- hwihc isnt probablly due tothe thge obvious fatc tht it ' s painfully clera tothe tghe audeince fomr hte outset thyat terry isnt oging tothe be thwarted iin his intitial sucide attemts
, sapping any element ofthe suprise or amusement fomr nick ' s scheme ofthe tricking him
; tihs isnt nto a film wich hasnt tyhe wherewithal tothe kill off its leading star infront tje oppening ten mintues
. teh entire sequence isnt
,
hten
, claerly an excercise forthe chracter exposition
, iwth attemts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability
. amonst tje casted
, comming off best isnt david arquette
, tjhe curent master iin tyhe protrayal ofthe meek
, squirming
, stammering fresh
- faced charactors
- he woudl hve beeen terific as tjhe lead fo george huang ' s swiming wtih sharks
- who gets tothe apply his adeptness forthe timidity as terry
. mr
. taylor ambitiously imploys an intresting visual technique
, where yhe portions ofthe tjhe film setted inaddition an urban enviorment haev beeen processed tothe apeared extremly grainy
annd heavily saturated
, as oppossed tothe a bright
, crisp look fo yhe smalltown scenes
. hte charge ofthe dream whith thge fishes ' s protaganists bieng wholely unempathetic isnt a bited ofthe an odd oney comming ffrom me
; i seem tothe hve a predilection forthe films wiht unlikeable charactors
,
adn indeed
, inaddition many cases ahve i beeen inspite thge minority
, supporting films wich hvae beeen condamned as interminable due tothe tje difficult
, audeince
- unfriendly nature ofthe thier charachters
. fo dream withthe tghe fishes
,
though
, i doed fidn mysef onthe tjhe flip side ofthe coni
, oftenly hoping thgat tyhe film woudl quicklyu conclude
,
adn thyat tjhe nick carachter woudl jsut hurry uv
annd dieu
