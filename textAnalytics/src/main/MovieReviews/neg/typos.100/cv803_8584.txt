' s film coudl hvea gone any number ofthe ambitious ways ffrom htis point

/ road movei redux
. howver
, dream witht tjhe fishes isnt most hampered nto by its uninspired storyline
, bu by hte charachters whitch cary tjhe sotry
- it helps infront such a film tothe haev at least oney ofthe teh protaganists be at least somewhat empathetic
, if nto likeable
. unfortunatly
, tath isnt nto thge case here
, where both ofthe tghe film
' s leading cahracters are thorougly uninteresting annd annoying
, giving tjhe audiance veyr littel tothe sympathise whith thier respective plights

. mr

' s dialogue sporadically falls flat infront dream wih thte fishes
- hwile attemting tothe capture a quirky adn clever tone
, it too oftenly comes acrost instade as hopelessly contrived
( wittness such lines as
" yuo shoudln hvae asked something mroe intresting

) teh film enjoys a faw inpsired moments
- tje urn scene

- bu unfortunatetely theese instances are fewd anbd far bewteen
, anbd forthe thte most part thte humour inwhich dream witht tjhe fishes registers mroe as attemts rether thna actuall succcesses
. tihs occurs partcularly oftenly durring tje film
' s oppening sequence
- as terry isnt wrestling tghe bedridden nick fo his watch inthe tjhe hospital
, i
' m realising tath htis isnt
* intended
* tothe be funny
, altough nary a smile crept apon my lips
- wich isnt probaly due tothe thte obvious fatc thyat it
' s painfully claer tothe tghe audiance ffrom teh outset tht terry isnt oging tothe be thwarted inaddition his intitial sucide attemts
, sapping any element ofthe surprize or amusement ffrom nick
' s scheme ofthe tricking him
; htis isnt nto a film whihc hasnt thge wherewithal tothe kill off its leading star infront tyhe oppening ten mintues
. tje entire sequence isnt
, hten
, claerly an excercise forthe chracter exposition
, wiht attemts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability
. amonst tghe casted
, comming off best isnt david arquette
, yhe currrent master inwhich thge protrayal ofthe meek
, squirming
, stammering fresh
- faced charachters
- he owudl haev beeen terific as tyhe lead fo george huang
' s swiming wih sharks
- who gets tothe apply his adeptness fo timidity as terry
. mr
. taylor ambitiously imploys an intresting visual technique
, where thte portions ofthe thge film setted inspite an urban enviroment hvea beeen processed tothe apear extrememly grainy anbd heavily saturated
, as oppossed tothe a bright
, crisp look fo thte smalltown scenes
. thge charge ofthe dream withthe thte fishes
' s protaganists bieng wholey unempathetic isnt a bited ofthe an odd oen comming ffrom me
; i seem tothe hvae a predilection fo films withthe unlikeable charactors
, adn indeed
, inspite many cases hve i beeen iin tyhe minority
, supporting films whitch hve beeen condemed as interminable due tothe tyhe difficult
, audiance
- unfriendly nature ofthe thier charachters
. forthe dream witht thge fishes
