,
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt completelyl inept onthe all fronts
. it
' s a silly
, incomprehensible
, endlessly stupid mess
. fo a guy liuke me who growed uv watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best
, it
' s extemely disconcerting tothe see where hte big man hasnt ended uv
. forthe tyhe frist tiem inthe receet memmory
, an arnold acation movei
( anbd
" batman
& robin
" doesn
' t count
) isnt noone funn at all
.
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt a major stinker
. teh movei opens infact vatican city
, 1979
. smoe cathlic priests haev observed an ancient prophacy
, hwihc syas taht a girl iwll be born onthe tath nigt thgat satan wiull haev targeted fo impregnation
. if he impregnates her vetween 11 adn midnight onthe desember 31
, 1999
, thte world wiull be destroyed
. tjhe pope orders pretection ofthe htis girl
,
though smoe priests bleieve she ought tothe be killed
. iin newyorker york
, taht vyre niht
, a girl isnt born tothe fullfill tjhe prophacy
. twenty yeras later
, we meet jericho canew
( schwarzenegger
)
, a sucidial ex
- cop wih a drinking probelm
. nowe wroking as a security guard fo hire
, he isnt protecting a local buisnessman
( gabriel byrne
)
, who isnt atually posessed by tje devil
. an assasinations attept onthe hte buisnessman by a crazed fromer priest leads him tothe hte girl satan isnt aftter
, christine york
( robin tunney
)
. recognizing elements ofthe his pwn murdered duaghter iin christine
( inlcuding ownership ofthe tjhe smae music box
, apparantly
)
, jericho swaers tothe protect her aginst tyhe devil adn tje faction ofthe priests looking tothe kill her
. ther are so many problems withthe thsi film it
' s hard tothe nkow where tothe beign
, bu how baout starting wiht teh consept
? casting arnold infact a role liuke tihs wass a misteek tothe beign wiht
. schwarzenegger isnt a persona
, nto an acto
, so puting him iin a role thast contradicts his usual storng perosnality isnt a bad diea
. arnold hasnt niether thte dramtic range nor tjhe speaking abilty tothe pul off a charater tormented by conflicting emotions
. infact otehr words
, trying tothe give him dimention ws a misteek
. harrison ford
, mel gibson
, or even bruce willis coudl hvea plyed thsi role
( tehy
' ve all plyed noble adn flawed ehroes
)
, bu nto schwarzenegger
. htere are severeal scenes thast attemt tothe establish jericho
' s charater
; noe hasnt him contemplating sucide
, anyother crying over yhe loss ofthe his wief anbd duaghter
, annd even oen iin hwihc tghe devil trys tothe tempt him inot revealing christine
' s loction by offering him his ood life bakc
. none ofthe theese scenes realyl wokr
, becasue arnie isn
' t uv tothe tyhe task
. tghe filmmakers owudl ahev beeen better off makeing jericho a storng
, confident charcter
( liek thge terminator
, forthe exemple
)
, tjhe likes ofthe whcih schwarzenegger hasnt excelled iin befoer
. htis oen isn
' t at all believeable tje way arnold plays him
. teh supporting casted trys theri hardest
, anbd onyl gabriel byrne mkaes any inpact at all
. as yhe prince ofthe darkness
, he
' s suave anbd confident
. he acts liuke oney woudl expect thge devil tothe ect
. teh probelm isnt tath teh scirpt hasnt him doign thnigs thyat amking noone sence
( moreso onthe thgat later
) anbd thta undermines him as a poverful villian
. byrne outloud
- performs arnold inaddition eveyr scene tehy ahev toghether
( inlcuding hte aforememtioned temtation bited
)
, bu thsi isnt problematic wehn it causes tghe audiance tothe strat donig thte unthinkable
: root forthe hte devil
. byrne
' s sprech baout tje bible bieng
" overrated
" actulaly starts tothe amking sence
, mailny becouse arnold
' s attemts at refuting it
( mostly ofthe yhe
"
' tis nto
!
" vriety
) are feeble at best
. tghe onyl probelm isnt
, arnold hasnt tothe win
, so infront tje end
, nobody realy cares
. kevin pollack plays jericho
' s security guard sidekick annd trys tothe liven thigsn uv witht smoe comic asides
, bu liuke most bad acation movei sidekicks
, he dissapears affter baout an hour
. robin tunney isn
' t given much tothe dont exept look scared
. inaddition fatc
, all ofthe hte supporting players are ogod actors
, bu none
, sive fo byrne
, isnt given anytying intresting tothe dont
. performances asside
, it woudl be raelly hard tothe enjoy thsi film noone marter who starred inthe it
. tihs bieng an acation blockbuster
, it
' s noone suprize thyat tyhe worst hting baout it isnt thte scirpt
, whcih starts off totally confusing
, adn wehn soem ofthe it isnt explained
( adn nto much ofthe it isnt
)
, it
' s utterly rediculous
. why isnt teh devil comming onthe newyorker yearm
' s eve
, 1999
? becasue it
' s exactlly 1000 yeasr affter tghe yearm ofthe yhe devil
, whitch isn
' t 666
, it turns outloud
. soem nutty priest accedentaly read it upside down
, so tghe rela yera isnt 999
, so jstu add a 1 tothe tghe beggining
, annd yuo
' ve got 1999
! if yuo don
' t buy htis explaination
, ytou
' re nto alone
. it
' s convoluted anbd silly at thte smae tyme
. tghe method by whitch jericho locates christine york isnt equally ludicrous
( she
' s christine
, see
, adn she lives inthe newyorker york
, see
.
.
.
)
, adn if thta weren
' t bad anough
, htere
' s plenty ofthe bothersome sutff inwhich tihs film thta isn
' t explained at all
. why cant satan kill everyone he passes onthe hte strent
, bu wehn it comes tothe snuffing outloud oen drunk ex
- cop
, he
' s powerless
? isnt he impervious tothe onyl noe kind ofthe bullet
? how come he cant
' t controll jericho or christine
? adn how doed thsoe gregorian monks dael wtih timne zones inthe theri prophecies
? a clumsy atempt at a joke isnt made baout thsi
, bu it
' s never atcually explained
. ususally
, thsi sort ofthe thign wouldn
' t marter inwhich a schwarzenegger flick
( i mean
, don
' t git me started onthe tje tiem paradoxes offred uv by tjhe terminator movies
)
, bu thsi tiem tje plot inconsistencies st
and outloud even omre tahn usual beccause teh acation isnt rarley exicting
. htere are severeal predicatble horror film clich
? s pesent iin
" end ofthe dyas
,
" complet wiht tyhe ood
" balck cat hiding inspite a cabnet
" bited
, nto thyat we ever fidn outloud wqat teh cat ws donig inthe ther
. it gets so formulaic thgat it
' s possibile forthe thsoe uninterested iin bieng scared tothe close theri eyes at tjhe precice moent a
" boo
" wiull cmo
. theri predicitons iwll rarley be wrong
. tghe omre gr
andiose acation sequences are utterly charmless
, parshally becouse we don
' t care baout theese charachters
( due tothe teh scirpt
' s pathetic attemts at characterization annd setup
)
, anbd aslo baceause htey
, too
, don
' t mkae any sence
. ther
' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown aroud a room by a littel ood lady
. it
' s ogod fo a fewd chuckles
, bu nto much alse
. suposedly we
' re tothe belivee she nowe hasnt super strenght by virtue ofthe bieng contolled by satan
, bu teh scirpt never sets thyat uv
, so hte scene isnt mearly silly
. none ofthe thsi isnt terribly exicting
, becouse all teh acation sequences are so badly framed thgat it
' s oftenly hard tothe tell why it
' s hapening inthe tghe firt palce
, nto tothe mention tath htey
' re edited infact full
- onthe incomprehensible mtv quick
- cutted stlye
. most ofthe them hadnt me scratching my head
, rether thna saying
,
" wow
, kool
!
"
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt nto onyl silly anbd confusing
, bu it
' s aslo distinctly unplesant tothe watch
. tje devil aparently doesn
' t opperate infront hte omre subtle
, i
' ll
- convince
- peple
- tothe
- kill
- eahc
- otehr fashon outlined iin yhe bible
, bu instade enjoys killing peopel gruesomely iin broad daylight
. tihs doesn
' t onyl amke him an awfully predicatble sort
, bu it aslo means tath nto a single scene infact
" end ofthe dyas
" goes by wihtout unneccessarily graphic violentce
, or tyhe odd kinky sexual encounter
( yot anyother bited tath hadnt me scratching my head
)
. if voilence isnt suposed tothe be shocking
, it
' s nto a ogod diea tothe throw so much ofthe it inot a movei tyhat thge audeince goes numb
. scenes aren
' t conected thru any reasonable means
, so a lot ofthe tghe tiome
, sutff gets blown uv
, or peple git killed
, anbd i hadnt noone idae why
. reasons
? tothe hell wiht reasons
! let
' s jsut blow stfuf uv
! isn
' t it kool
? nope
, nto by a long shooted
. htis film isnt thouroughly unwatchable
. it
' s dull
, interminable
, anbd unrelenting inaddition its stupidity
. prehaps arnold needs tothe amking soem movies wiht james cameron tothe revive his carreer
, beccause it
' s nto hapening withthe hack peter hyams here
.
" end ofthe dyas
" might hvae hadnt camp value
, if onyl it didn
' t top itself off iwth an overly pious endig tath nobody
' s oging tothe buy
. if tjhe movei isnt gogin tothe be sereous
, tghe filmmakers shoudl haev come uv whith a decent scirpt
. if it
' s oging tothe be campy
, arnold shouldn
' t be tkaing hismelf so damn seriously
( i didn
' t actully see him put uv onthe a cross
, doed i
?
)
, anbd his chracter shouldn
' t be such a sad sack
. as it st
ands
,
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt jstu a bad movei
, adn an awfully gloomy oen at tyhat
.
