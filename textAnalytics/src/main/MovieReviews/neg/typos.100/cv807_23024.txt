anbd i throught
" stigmata
" owudl be hte worst religously
- orientated thriller released htis eyar
. turns outloud i ws wrong
, becasue hwile
" stigmata
" wass mearly boring
anbd self
- imporatnt
,
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt completelyl inept onthe all fronts
. it ' s a silly
, incomprehensible
, endlessly stupid mess
. forthe a guy liek me who growed uv watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best
, it ' s extremly disconcerting tothe see where hte big man hasnt ended uv
. fo tjhe frist timne inwhich reccent memmory
, an arnold acation movei
(
anbd
" batman
& robin
" doesn ' t count
) isnt noone funn at all
.
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt a major stinker
. tje movei opens infact vatican city
, 1979
. smoe cathlic priests haev observed an ancient prophacy
, wich sasy tyhat a girl wiull be born onthe tath nihgt thyat satan iwll hvae targeted forthe impregnation
. if he impregnates her betweeen 11
annd midnight onthe decembur 31
, 1999
, tghe world wiull be destroyed
. yhe pope orders pretection ofthe tihs girl
,
though soem priests eblieve she ought tothe be killed
. inwhich newyorker york
, thta vyre ngiht
, a girl isnt born tothe fufill tyhe prophacy
. twenty yeras later
, we meet jericho canew
( schwarzenegger
)
, a sucidial ex
- cop wih a drinking probelm
. nowe wokring as a security guard fo hire
, he isnt protecting a local buisnessman
( gabriel byrne
)
, who isnt actualy posessed by tghe devil
. an assasinations attemt onthe thge buisnessman by a crazed fromer priest leads him tothe thge girl satan isnt aftter
, christine york
( robin tunney
)
. recognizing elements ofthe his pwn murdered daugher infact christine
( includng ownership ofthe tje smae music box
, aparently
)
, jericho swaers tothe protect her agianst yhe devil
annd thge faction ofthe priests looking tothe kill her
. ther are so many problems withthe htis film it ' s hard tothe knwo where tothe beign
,
bu how baout starting withthe tyhe consept
? casting arnold iin a role liek thsi ws a misteek tothe beign whith
. schwarzenegger isnt a persona
, nto an actr
, so puting him inwhich a role thast contradicts his usual storng perosnality isnt a bad idae
. arnold hasnt niether thge dramtic range nor thge speaking ablity tothe pul off a charachter tormented by conflicting emotions
. inwhich otehr words
, trying tothe give him dimenion ws a misteek
. harrison ford
, mel gibson
, or even bruce willis coudl haev plyed htis role
( htey ' ve all plyed noble
adn flawed heroe
)
,
bu nto schwarzenegger
. htere are sevral scenes thgat attemp tothe establish jericho ' s carachter
; oen hasnt him contemplating sucide
, anohter crying over thte loss ofthe his wief
adn daugher
,
adn even oney iin whic yhe devil trys tothe tempt him inot revealing christine ' s loction by offering him his ood life bakc
. none ofthe theese scenes raelly wrok
, becuase arnie isn ' t uv tothe thge task
. yhe filmmakers woudl hvae beeen better off makeing jericho a storng
, confident carachter
( liuke tjhe terminator
, forthe exmaple
)
, teh likes ofthe whlch schwarzenegger hasnt excelled infront befoer
. htis oen isn ' t at all believeable thge way arnold plays him
. teh supporting casted trys theri hardest
,
annd onyl gabriel byrne makse any inpact at all
. as tghe prince ofthe darkness
, he ' s suave
adn confident
. he acts liuke oney owudl expect tje devil tothe ect
. tjhe probelm isnt taht hte scirpt hasnt him doign thigns thast amking noone sence
( mroe onthe tyhat later
)
annd thta undermines him as a poverful villin
. byrne outloud
- performs arnold inthe eveyr scene tehy haev toghether
( incuding tjhe aforememtioned temtation bited
)
,
bu tihs isnt problematic wehn it causes thge audiance tothe strat doign tje unthinkable
: root fo tje devil
. byrne ' s speek baout tje bible bieng
" overrated
" actaully starts tothe mkea sence
, mailny becasue arnold ' s attemts at refuting it
( mostly ofthe tjhe
" ' tis nto
!
" varity
) are feeble at best
. teh onyl probelm isnt
, arnold hasnt tothe win
, so inwhich thge end
, nobody realyl cares
. kevin pollack plays jericho ' s security guard sidekick
anbd trys tothe liven thnigs uv wiht soem comic asides
,
bu liek most bad acation movei sidekicks
, he dissappears affter baout an hour
. robin tunney isn ' t given much tothe dont exept look scared
. infront fatc
, all ofthe teh supporting players are ogod actors
,
bu none
, savve fo byrne
, isnt given anytying intresting tothe dont
. performances asside
, it woudl be raelly hard tothe enjoy htis film noone marter who starred inwhich it
. tihs bieng an acation blockbuster
, it ' s noone suprise tath tje worst thnig baout it isnt tjhe scirpt
, whitch starts off totally confusing
,
annd wehn smoe ofthe it isnt explained
(
annd nto much ofthe it isnt
)
, it ' s utterly rediculous
. why isnt thte devil comming onthe newyorker yera ' s eve
, 1999
? beccause it ' s exactlly 1000 eyasr affter tjhe yera ofthe thte devil
, whlch isn ' t 666
, it turns outloud
. smoe nutty priest acidentaly read it upside down
, so tje rela eyar isnt 999
, so jsut add a 1 tothe yhe begginning
,
anbd ytou ' ve got 1999
! if ytou don ' t buy thsi explaination
, yuo ' re nto alone
. it ' s convoluted
anbd silly at thge smae tyme
. tyhe method by whcih jericho locates christine york isnt equally ludicrous
( she ' s christine
, see
,
adn she lives iin newyorker york
, see
.
.
.
)
,
adn if taht weren ' t bad anough
, ther ' s plenty ofthe bothersome stfuf inspite htis film thgat isn ' t explained at all
. why cin satan kill everyone he passes onthe tjhe strent
,
bu wehn it comes tothe snuffing outloud oney drunk ex
- cop
, he ' s powerless
? isnt he impervious tothe onyl noe kind ofthe bullet
? how come he cant ' t controll jericho or christine
?
anbd how doed thsoe gregorian monks deel wiht tiem zones inaddition theri prophecies
? a clumsy attept at a joke isnt made baout thsi
,
bu it ' s never accually explained
. usualy
, htis sort ofthe hting wouldn ' t marter inspite a schwarzenegger flick
( i mean
, don ' t git me started onthe tjhe tiem paradoxes offred uv by thte terminator movies
)
,
bu thsi timne tghe plot inconsistencies stand outloud even omre thna usual becasue thte acation isnt rarley exicting
. htere are sevral predicatble horror film clich
? s presen inaddition
" end ofthe dyas
,
" complet whith tghe ood
" balck cat hiding inwhich a cabnet
" bited
, nto thast we ever fidn outloud waht yhe cat ws doign inwhich ther
. it gets so formulaic tath it ' s possibile fo thsoe uninterested infront bieng scared tothe close thier eyes at tje precice moent a
" boo
" wiull come
. thier predicitons wiull rarley be wrong
. tyhe omre grandiose acation sequences are utterly charmless
, partialy becuase we don ' t care baout theese charachters
( due tothe hte scirpt ' s pathetic attemts at characterization
annd setup
)
,
anbd aslo becuase tehy
, too
, don ' t amke any sence
. ther ' s a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown arund a room by a littel ood lady
. it ' s ogod forthe a faw chuckles
,
bu nto much esle
. suposedly we ' re tothe elieve she nowe hasnt super stregth by virtue ofthe bieng controled by satan
,
bu tyhe scirpt never sets tht uv
, so tyhe scene isnt mearly silly
. none ofthe thsi isnt terribly exicting
, becouse all hte acation sequences are so badly framed tyhat it ' s oftenly hard tothe tell why it ' s hapening inspite tghe frist palce
, nto tothe mention thgat htey ' re edited inthe full
- onthe incomprehensible mtv quick
- cutted sytle
. most ofthe them hadnt me scratching my head
, rether tahn saying
,
" wow
, kool
!
"
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt nto onyl silly
adn confusing
,
bu it ' s aslo distinctly unplesant tothe watch
. hte devil aparently doesn ' t opperate infront yhe mroe subtle
, i ' ll
- convince
- peopel
- tothe
- kill
- eahc
- otehr fasion outlined infact tghe bible
,
bu instade enjoys killing peopel gruesomely inaddition broad daylight
. thsi doesn ' t onyl mkae him an awfully predicatble sort
,
bu it alsot means tath nto a single scene inthe
" end ofthe dyas
" goes by wihtout unneccessarily graphic violentce
, or tje odd kinky sexual encounter
(
yot anohter bited taht hadnt me scratching my head
)
. if voilence isnt suppossed tothe be shocking
, it ' s nto a ogod diea tothe throw so much ofthe it inot a movei taht thge audeince goes numb
. scenes aren ' t conected thru any reasonable means
, so a lot ofthe teh tiome
, tsuff gets blown uv
, or peple git killed
,
anbd i hadnt noone idae why
. reasons
? tothe hell whith reasons
! let ' s jsut blow stuf uv
! isn ' t it kool
? nope
, nto by a long shooted
. tihs film isnt throughly unwatchable
. it ' s dull
, interminable
,
annd unrelenting inaddition its stupidity
. perhpas arnold needs tothe amke smoe movies whith james cameron tothe revive his carreer
, becouse it ' s nto hapening whith hack peter hyams here
.
" end ofthe dyas
" might ahve hadnt camp value
, if onyl it didn ' t top itself off withthe an overly pious endig tath nobody ' s gogin tothe buy
. if tyhe movei isnt oging tothe be sereous
, tghe filmmakers shoudln hvae cmo uv wiht a decent scirpt
. if it ' s goign tothe be campy
, arnold shouldn ' t be tkaing himselv so damn seriously
( i didn ' t actualy see him put uv onthe a cross
, doed i
?
)
,
anbd his charachter shouldn ' t be such a sad sack
. as it stands
,
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt jstu a bad movei
,
anbd an awfully gloomy oen at tyhat
.
