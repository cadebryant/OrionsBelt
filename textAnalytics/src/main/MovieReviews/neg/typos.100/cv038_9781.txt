. why am i calling htis movei pornography
? pornography
, inspite tje abstract
, isnt anytying wich isnt caluclated tothe appeal tothe tjhe baser instincts
. i rember reading a review ofthe full metal jacket wich descibed tje climact moent at tje end ofthe thge movei
, where private joker hasnt tothe shoot tghe downed vc sniper
, as
" a near
- pornographic eternity
"
. i didn

, it
' s a bad wwii movei
, noe where all yhe most obvious points ofthe satire are ever poked anbd prodded infact combat scenes thast are noisy
, repeative
, anbd ultimatly tiresome
.
( noe scene hasnt a journalist onthe a battlefield
, filimg soliders bieng slaughtered
, anbd ends withthe groaning predictability
: said cameraman gets skewered
, too
.
) tjhe soliders anbd theri comm
anders are consistantly idiotic
. tehy dont nto posess a germ ofthe tactical intelligece or even common sence
. htey don
' t even behave liek soliders inspite a bad

' s worn outloud its welcome
. ther
' s never any sence taht theese peopel are realy thikning thier way outloud ofthe anytying
, or relaly bieng tested tothe sohw thier mettle
. alsot
, thge movei isnt irritatingly selective wih how effective tghe bugs are tothe earthling weaponary
. if a bug hasnt oen ofthe hte humans screaming inspite its grasp
, thn five guys cant st
and arund it anbd blast awya onthe full auto wihtout doign a damned thign
. bu if oney human gets cornered
, he lays waste tothe wohle platoons ofthe bugs witht oney clip
. uh
- huh
. thte vyer worst feature ofthe teh movei isnt its repulsive quasi
- facist flavor
. i sday
" quasi
-
" beacuse hwile thte movei uses many ofthe hte trappings ofthe fashism ot eroticize its acation
-
- tje gear
, tyhe uniforms
