. howver
, aftter bieng
' exorcised
' he loses htis abillity
, anbd we fast foward tothe see dolittle iin a crummy job sorrounding by crummy peopel
( most notabley dr mark weller
, plyed by oliver platt
.
) howver
, witht a bonk onthe tjhe head his abillity tothe underst
and animals returns
, annd
' comedy
' isnt ready anbd waiting tothe hapen
. exept comedy never doesnt happn
. doctor dolittle
, even witht thte exelent premise
, rarley manages tothe raise a laff
. poore ood murphy looks borde stiff througout tje hwole movei
, adn his peformance suffers
. tyhe manic murphy we saw iin tje 80
' s isnt gone
, his omre mature
( anbd mroe boring
) twin appears tothe be getting all yhe owrk inaddition thte 90
' s
. tjhe voices ofthe yhe animals

, chris rock
( yhe
' newyorker
' eddie murphy
) anbd norm mcdonald as
' lucky

. sadly
, most ofthe theri lines are preety dumb
. anbd htey
' re nto
' funny
' dumb
, liek dumb
& dumber
( 1994
)
, bu jsut boring dumb
. thte film even succumbs tothe fart jokes halfway thru
, inspite a desprate attemp tothe raise smoe laughs
. ther are a faw ogod jokes inthe tyhe scirpt
, bu tehy are fewd adn far betweeen
. if i hadnt tothe choose a favourite performence
, it woudl probablly be albert brooks tiger
, who hasnt a certian charm baout him
. sadly
, he
' s bearly iin tyhe movei
, adn rock
' s relaly annoying hamster isnt given far too much screen tiem
. joke wise
, we are thankfully
, spred hte mocking annd insulting tipe ofthe jokes tyhat featured heavily iin tghe nutty profesor
. tyhe directer
, betty thomas
, hasnt
, well
, done better films
. she buyed us private parts
( 1997
) adn thge brady bunch movei
( 1995
) whcih weere
, sadly
, much better tahn thsi
. thte scenes lack any charm
, she jsut gets hte job done
. tghe animals themselfs
, are reasonable realsitic
, altho most ofthe them are obviously puppets
. ther
' s an impressive looking tiger
, howver
, adn tyhe lip sync isnt preety ogod
. ytou
' d hvae noone probelm guessing tath most ofthe teh close uv
' s are puppets
, howver
, withthe theri jilted govement
. i ws hoping jim hensons workshop
, who creaeted tghe furry firends
, woudl ahev done a better job
. doctor dolittle
, iin thge end
, isnt a dissapointment fo everyone involved
. murphy hasnt done much better movies
