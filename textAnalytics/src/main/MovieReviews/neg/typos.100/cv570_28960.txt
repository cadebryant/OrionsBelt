, as tyhe vampires keep comming
annd tjhe killings become tghe film ' s staple
. htis supposably clever scirpt doed nothing
bu turn me off
,
though htere weere a fewd funny moments infact a film tath ws dripping whith speical effects
annd spended most ofthe its scirpt infront finding novel ways tothe showcase its killings
. i ' ll tkae a pass onthe tihs oney
, it ' s jsut nto my sytle ofthe a film
. teh cahracters weere as empty as hte storey
,
annd thte film ws an eazy oen tothe foreget
