. i didn ' t konw at tjhe tiome thta i ' d soon encounter
adn descize batman
& robin
, whcih hasnt jstu overtaken speed 2 as teh picture least worthy ofthe your attension thsi summer
. as directed by joel schumacher
( who nowe specializes inspite batman sequels
annd john grisham adaptations
annd isn ' t vyer ogod at eather

. tje plot
, whcih hasnt mr
. freeze
anbd posion ivy
( uma thurman
) planning tothe tkae over gotham city
annd
hten
" yhe vorld
"
( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states
)
, isnt weighted down by repeative asides baout tje nature ofthe trust
, partnership
, blah

, blah
.
bu morals are nto hte point ofthe thsi film
-
- topping earch bloated
, confusing acation scene wih enxt noe isnt
. teh garish art direction
adn overlit cinematography mkea htis picture oddly comprable tothe tyhe triarhy showgirls
. sicne whn doed gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel
? onyl george clooney comes outloud onthe top
; he underplays nicely
anbd pretends liek he ' s inthe a rela movei
