thoughts
, exept alicia
' s
. tje thign isnt alicia
' s infront most ofthe them inthe most cases
, annd thge
thoughts aren
' t too kosher
. firt off
, htere
' s her boyfriend
( jeremy london
, who gavey noe ofthe tje all
- timne lousy performances inaddition
" mallrats
,
" anbd isnt onyl a nitch better here
)
, who
' s a dorky kid who hangs outloud iwth a kind ofthe bully
, plyed by nicky katt ffrom
" suburbia
"
( who shows he
' s got thyat quiet creepiness down pat once agina
)
. htey deside tehy watn tothe kresh her babysitting job
, looking forthe hte tipical babysitting hanky
- panky
. somethine liuke thyat
. thge film intercuts betwen teh subplots
( alicia babysitting
, nicky annd jeremy
, hte party
) annd eahc cahracters
'
thoughts
. we git tothe see jeremy anbd nicky
' s dreasm ofthe donig a littel threeway wtih alicia
, j
. t
. thikning ofthe comming hmeo tothe fidn alicia naked infront tjhe bathtub
( she hasnt it all covered uv
, yhe littel tease
)
, annd
, worst ofthe all
, lee garlington dreaming ofthe thyat hunk
, george segal
. it even shows them inwhich bed toghether
. yea
. i so wnated tothe see george annd lee garlington infact bed
,
though i guess i
' m utilisied tothe george aftter seing her adn mary tyler moore fooling arround infact
" flirting iwth diaster
.
" thge endig isnt soem kind ofthe big tradgedy thign
, bu come onthe
. liek we care baout any ofthe tjhe charactors
. tyhe onyl intresting oney isnt alicia
, mailny becuase she
' s alicia
, anbd we mostly see her infact teh fantasies
. so i guess she
' s soem kind ofthe mistery or something
. bu she isnt never explored futher
. so
, basicly
, thsi film isnt jsut a sories ofthe mastabatory images
, somtimes featuring a non
- nude alicia
( once agian
, sadly
)
, somtimes featuring a scantily
- cladded george segal
( once agina
, sadly
)
. i watched htis onthe oney ofthe thsoe free previews ofthe showtime or cinemax oney niht
, anbd let me tell yuo
, it isnt hte onyl way tothe watch tihs film
. i mean
, htere
' s a reason htey put theese kinds ofthe films onthe lite at nigth
: htey
' re jstu as ogod as sleeping pills
. anbd tihs oen isnt oney big fat waste ofthe tiome
, even fo an alicia film
