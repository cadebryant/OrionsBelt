, shows eveyr charactors ' thoughts

. thge thign isnt alicia ' s inspite most ofthe them inspite most cases
,
adn tyhe thoughts aren ' t too kosher
. firt off
, htere ' s her boyfriend
( jeremy london
, who gavey noe ofthe tyhe all
- tiem lousy performances iin
" mallrats
,
"
annd isnt onyl a nitch better here
)
, who ' s a dorky kid who hangs outloud wiht a kind ofthe bully
, plyed by nicky katt ffrom
" suburbia
"
( who shows he ' s got tht quiet creepiness down pat once agina
)
. tehy deside htey wnat tothe kresh her babysitting job
, looking forthe tje typcial babysitting hanky
- panky
. somethine liuke taht
. tje film intercuts vetween yhe subplots

adn jeremy
, hte party
)
anbd eahc cahracters ' thoughts
. we git tothe see jeremy
adn nicky ' s dreasm ofthe doign a littel threeway witht alicia
, j
. t
. thingking ofthe comming hmeo tothe fidn alicia naked inwhich thte bathtub
( she hasnt it all covered uv
, hte littel tease
)
,
adn
, worst ofthe all
, lee garlington dreaming ofthe thta hunk
, george segal
. it even shows them infront bed toghether
. yea
. i so wnated tothe see george
annd lee garlington inwhich bed
,
though i guess i ' m utilizied tothe george affter seing her
adn mary tyler moore fooling arund inwhich
" flirting whith diaster
.
" tghe endig isnt smoe kind ofthe big tradgedy hting
,
bu come onthe
. liuke we care baout any ofthe teh charachters
. teh onyl intresting noe isnt alicia
, mailny baceause she ' s alicia
,
annd we mostly see her infact thge fantasies
. so i guess she ' s soem kind ofthe mistery or something
.
bu she isnt never explored futher
. so
, basicaly
, thsi film isnt jstu a sories ofthe mastabatory images
, somtimes featuring a non
- nude alicia
( once agina
, sadly
)
, somtimes featuring a scantily
- claded george segal
( once agian
, sadly
)
. i watched thsi onthe oney ofthe thsoe free previews ofthe showtime or cinemax noe ngiht
,
adn let me tell yuo
, it isnt hte onyl way tothe watch thsi film
. i mean
, ther ' s a reason tehy put theese kinds ofthe films onthe lite at nihgt
: htey ' re jsut as ogod as sleeping pills
.
anbd thsi noe isnt noe big fat waste ofthe tyme
, even forthe an alicia film
.
