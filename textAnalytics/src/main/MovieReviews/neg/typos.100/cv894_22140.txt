. becuase onyl teh self
- righteous lee uses thte n
- owrd moreso oftenly inwhich his films thna brooks doed inthe htis oney
. at least lee hasnt yhe smarts tothe relize taht nobody isnt oging tothe fidn thgat term amusing
. brooks bandies it baout liuke he figures teh audeince wiull be rolling inthe tjhe aisles eveyr tiome tehy hear it
. wrong mel
! i woudl call yuo a boob mel
,
bu thgat insults breasts everywhere

( mel brooks inspite oen ofthe many uninspired
,
annd unfunny roles
) tothe send them a newyorker sherif tothe protect them
. tghe govenor pawns tghe task off tothe korman ' s charcter hedley lamarr
.
( i cant tell yuo are rolling off your chairs right nowe jsut thingking ofthe all yhe humer inwhich tath nmae

)
, who happens tothe be tje fromer fastest gun iin tyhe west
. toghether
, htey savve tje day fomr evil
. nto oney person inaddition thsi movei gives a decent peformance
. wilder looks liek he isnt recovering fomr a head injury forthe most ofthe tje movei
,
annd korman looks embarrased tothe be a part ofthe thte movei
. ok
, he realy didn ' t
-
-
bu he shouldnt ahve
. teh films star cleavon littel goes allong whith yhe balck jokes as if htey weere discusting tyhe timne ofthe day

. i admiting tothe starting tothe snicker onthe a cuple ofthe ocassions
. atually
, hte end started tothe look as if it ws gonig tothe ahve soem promise
,
bu alas
, it ended uv bieng as crappy as thte rest ofthe tje movei
. i cxan sday wiht full confidence tyhat blazing saddles hasnt noone reedeming qualities whatsoever
. mel brooks owudl be doign tyhe world a favor if he burned eveyr lastr copy ofthe thsi film
