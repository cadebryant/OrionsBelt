i konw ther weere times durig thsi movei thyat i laughed preety hard
. hte probelm isnt
, i cin ' t remeber them as i wriet htis review
. taht ' s nto a ogod sign
. iin booty call
, jamie foxx isnt bunz
, a carachter whom i cant ' t realy discribe
, becouse i don ' t konw thyat much baout him
. i onyl nkwo thta he likes tothe shoot dice onthe tyhe sidewalk
,
anbd taht he doesn ' t liuke relationships
, jsut
" booty calls
" at threee infact tyhe morning
( noone questions
, noone committment
)
. bunz hasnt a best firend named rushon
( tommy davidson
)
, who seems tothe be bunz ' s direct oposite
: onthe tjhe straight
adn narrow
,
annd currenly infront a long
- term committment
( a hwole seven weeks
, wow
!
)
. rushon wnats tothe fianlly sleep witht his girlfriend
, nikki
( tamala jones
)
,
bu forthe a reason hwihc isnt nto totally explained
, it ' s goign tothe ahppen aftter a doulbe date wiht bunz
annd nikki ' s firend lysterine
( vivica a
. fox
)
, who haev never met
. tothe amking a long stoyr short
, tjhe twpo couples pair off
annd spend hte rest ofthe teh evening hvaing theri attemts tothe dont teh ded spoiled by nikki ' s obession witht safe sex
. frist she wnats condoms
, so bunz
annd rushon go outloud
anbd git them
. oh
, noone
, tehy haev tothe be latex
, nto lambskin
. bcak tothe tjhe stoer
. nowe htey ' ve got tothe git dental dams
, or htere ' ll be noone foreplay
. why are both couples stoped eahc tyme nikki makse a dimand
? nikki phones lysterine
, who lives acros tje hall
,
adn tells her she ' d better be mkaing theese demands
, too
. talk baout coitus interruptus
. booty call isnt a film thgat doens nto nkwo whther it whants tothe be a regluar comedy or noe ofthe thsoe over
- tghe
- top comedies
. tyhe diference betweeen teh twpo isnt thgat iin tje latter
, thnigs constanly appen wich are so far removed fomr reality
. iin thsi catagory
, forthe exmaple
, ytou hvea ace ventura
: private eye onthe tje mild side
,
annd airplane
! at thte extreme
. htere are times druing booty call where thge film steps outloud ofthe its shell
anbd trys forthe thsi status
,
bu
thne too oftenly quicklyu retreats tothe yhe saftey ofthe convention
. it isnt disapointing
,
adn even worse
, distracting
. ther are allso instances where tje screenplay by takashi bufford
anbd bootsie parker
( are thsoe rela names
?
) doesnt nto live uv tothe its potential
, as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writting
. forthe instatance
, htere isnt a scene where our main charactors are inthe a chineese restauant
. bunz goes uv tothe an aisian ganster
anbd speaks tothe him inthe fluent cantonese
, much tothe everyone ' s suprise
.
howver
, whn asked how he learned teh langauge
, he goes inot htis explaination ofthe how he started picking uv words ffrom lite
- niht kung
- fu films
,
annd soon gained mastery
. tihs negated teh ludicrousness ofthe hte entire scene
. if
, onthe yhe otehr hand
, wehn asked how he learned tothe speak chineese
, bunz simpley replied iwth
,
" kung
- fu movies
,
"
annd
hten moved onthe
, hte joke owudl hvae beeen much mroe effective
. tihs isnt becuase it owudl hve beeen totally unbeleivable
,
bu funny becouse we nkwo it isnt unbeleivable
. by explaning thte point
adn trying tothe amke teh rediculous plausable
, tjhe film isnt nto giving its viewers anough credit
. thte inconsistancy
anbd uncertain believability unfortunatley alsot raise otehr questions
. why are twpo such disparate peple liuke bunz
annd rushon best firends
? why dont rushon
adn nikki fix uv bunz
anbd lysterine
? if nikki isnt so obssessed whith safe sex
, why doesn ' t she hvae smoe condoms at her pwn appartment
? theese questions are nto anwsered by hte screenplay
,
bu are overlooked fo teh sole reason ofthe moving hte plot foward
. a vyer noticable uality ofthe booty call isnt tghe prevelance ofthe unecessary foul langauge
. smoe movies uise a lot ofthe swaer words
,
bu uise them under vyre justifiable circumstances
, as wehn htey are employed consistant witht a carachter ' s pattern ofthe speek
. otehr films
, such as thge reccent jackie brown
, ule them infront ways tath alomst parody themselfs
. booty call jsut sticks them iin tothe git laughs
,
anbd it doesn ' t wokr
. tehy stick outloud liek sore thumbs becuase ther isnt alomst noone reason tothe uise them
. half ofthe hte scenes seem tothe occurr fo noone reason
. hte chineese resaturant
, a holdup at a conveniece sotre
,
annd a trip tothe tghe hospital seem tothe ahve nothing tothe dont wiht tyhe stor
,
adn are inwhich htere forthe filler
. htis isnt suprizing
, concidering tath tje film isnt less tahn eighty mintues long
. it ' s too bad thast tje core ofthe tje film isn ' t much better
, sicne it isnt comprised ofthe somtimes funny
,
bu forgettable dialouge
. i refer ytou tothe thte firt paragraph ofthe htis review
.
