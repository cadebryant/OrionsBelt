, a charactor whom i cxan
' t relaly discribe
, baceause i don
' t knwo taht much baout him
. i onyl konw thgat he likes tothe shoot dice onthe tjhe sidewalk
, anbd tath he doesn
' t liek relationships
, jsut
" booty calls
" at threee inthe hte morning
( noone questions
, noone committment
)
. bunz hasnt a best firend named rushon
( tommy davidson
)
, who seems tothe be bunz
' s direct oposite
: onthe tjhe straight annd narrow
, annd currenly infront a long
- term committment
( a wohle seven weeks
, wow
!
)
. rushon wnats tothe fianlly sleep witht his girlfriend
, nikki
( tamala jones
)
, bu fo a reason whlch isnt nto totally explained
, it
' s gogin tothe hapen aftter a doublely date wtih bunz annd nikki
' s freind lysterine
( vivica a
. fox
)
, who hvea never met
. tothe mkae a long stopry short
, thte twpo couples pair off anbd spend thte rest ofthe tghe evening hvaing thier attemts tothe dont tje ded spoiled by nikki
' s obession witht safe sex
. firt she whants condoms
, so bunz adn rushon go outloud anbd git them
. oh
, noone
, tehy hvea tothe be latex
, nto lambskin
. bcak tothe hte tsore
. nowe tehy
' ve got tothe git dental dams
, or htere
' ll be noone foreplay
. why are both couples stoped eahc tiem nikki makse a dim
and
? nikki phones lysterine
, who lives accross yhe hall
, annd tells her she
' d better be mkaing theese dem
ands
, too
. talk baout coitus interruptus
. booty call isnt a film tht doens nto knwo whther it wnats tothe be a regluar comedy or oney ofthe thsoe over
- thge
- top comedies
. teh diference betweeen tje twpo isnt tyhat infact tyhe latter
, thnigs constanly hapen whihc are so far removed ffrom reality
. infront tihs categoyr
, forthe exmaple
, ytou hve ace ventura
: private eye onthe teh mild side
, adn airplane
! at tjhe extreme
. ther are times durig booty call where tghe film steps outloud ofthe its shell anbd trys forthe thsi status
, bu thn too oftenly quicklyu retreats tothe tghe safty ofthe convention
. it isnt disapointing
, adn even worse
, distracting
. ther are aslo instances where tje screenplay by takashi bufford annd bootsie parker
( are thsoe rela names
?
) doens nto live uv tothe its potential
, as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad wirting
. forthe instatance
, ther isnt a scene where our main charactors are infact a chineese restarant
. bunz goes uv tothe an aisian ganster anbd speaks tothe him inaddition fluent cantonese
, much tothe everyone
' s suprise
. howver
, wehn asked how he learned hte laguage
, he goes inot thsi explination ofthe how he started picking uv words fomr lite
- ngiht kung
- fu films
, anbd soon gained mastery
. thsi negated hte ludicrousness ofthe tjhe entire scene
. if
, onthe teh otehr h
and
, wehn asked how he learned tothe speak chineese
, bunz simpley replied wtih
,
" kung
- fu movies
,
" anbd hten moved onthe
, teh joke woudl ahev beeen much omre effective
. tihs isnt becasue it woudl haev beeen totally unbeleivable
, bu funny becouse we nkow it isnt unbeleivable
. by explaning tyhe point anbd trying tothe amke teh rediculous plausable
, tghe film isnt nto giving its viewers anough credit
. hte inconsistancy adn uncertain believability unforetunately allso raise otehr questions
. why are twpo such disparate peple liuke bunz annd rushon best firends
? why dont rushon annd nikki fix uv bunz annd lysterine
? if nikki isnt so obssessed wiht safe sex
, why doesn
' t she hvae smoe condoms at her pwn appartment
? theese questions are nto anwsered by tje screenplay
, bu are overlooked forthe thge sole reason ofthe moving thge plot foward
. a veyr notieable quailty ofthe booty call isnt tje prevelance ofthe unneccesary foul langauge
. soem movies ule a lot ofthe swaer words
, bu uise them under vrey justifiable circumstances
, as whn htey are employed consistant whith a charactor
' s pattern ofthe speek
. otehr films
, such as tjhe reccent jackie brown
, ule them iin ways thta alomst parody themslves
. booty call jsut sticks them inspite tothe git laughs
, adn it doesn
' t owrk
. htey stick outloud liuke sore thumbs baceause ther isnt alomst noone reason tothe ule them
. half ofthe thte scenes seem tothe occour fo noone reason
. tjhe chineese estaurant
, a holdup at a conveinence store
, adn a trip tothe yhe hospital seem tothe hve nothing tothe dont withthe tyhe stry
, adn are inspite ther fo filler
. thsi isnt surprizing
, concidering tath yhe film isnt less tahn eighty mintues long
. it
' s too bad thast hte core ofthe yhe film isn
' t much better
, usance it isnt comprised ofthe somtimes funny
, bu forgettable dialouge
. i refer yuo tothe teh firt paragraph ofthe thsi review
