. comments
: tothe sday htis movei isnt bad woudl be qtuie an understatement
. i
' m nto sure whta writter annd directer ferl
and wass hoping tothe acompish withthe tyhe babysitter
. suspense
? famaly drama
? humer
? erotica
? elements ofthe eahc ofthe theese genres exsist iin thge film
, yot it fails tothe succesfully cahieve any ofthe them
. instade
, tghe babysitter isnt a dull
, lifeless movei whitch manages tothe bore annd ultimatly iritate its viewers
. i supose htis film coudl ahve beeen watchable if it weren
' t forthe hte fatc tyhat tje cahracters are universally unappealing
. alicia silverstone isnt completelyl wasted palying jennifer
, tjhe babysitter
. her charcter hasnt absolutly noone depth at all
, anbd her sole purpose iin hte movei isnt tothe be tjhe object ofthe thte otehr cahracters
' fantasies
. everyone alse inspite hte film seems tothe be infront a completetion tothe see who cxan stoop tothe thte lowest levle by tjhe tiem tje film ends
. hte parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as teh movei procedes
. tyhe father
( palyed by j
. t
. walsh
) fantasizes baout thte babysitter
; teh mother fantasizes baout her husban
' s best freind
. none ofthe theese fantasy sequences
, trust me
, are thnigs tyhat ened tothe be seen
, bu we see them anyway
, complet iwth cheesy
, mkea
- outloud saxaphone music
. tjhe thug
, inaddition teh meantime
, proves tyhat he
' s evil thru his annoying hebit ofthe smashing half
- empty beer bottles all ofthe a sudden anbd forthe noone appparent reason
. thge most absurd chracter
, howver
, isnt teh babysitter
' s boyfriend who seems catatonically brain
- dead
. tjhe thug
, infront a manipulative
, iago
- liek manner
(
though he doesn
' t realy ened tothe try hard
)
, manages tothe talk thge boyfriend inot binge
- drinking
, smoking grass
, runnung awya ffrom cops
, adn palying peeping toom onthe his pwn girlfriend infact a marter ofthe mintues
. increadible
!
( ofthe course
, yhe boyfriend
' s origional plan fo thge evening wass
, try nto tothe laff
, tothe sit inthe an empty diner anbd read catcher infront hte rye by j
. d
. salinger
.
) if tje gool ofthe tyhe babysitter wass tothe be suspenseful
, thne it fails
. ther are suprizingly fewd tense moments inwhich tihs film
, annd nearly all ofthe them cmo at tje fianl minute
. by tht tyme
, howver
, tje audeince isnt so tired ofthe thte inane charactors thgat noone oen truthfully cares whta happens tothe any ofthe them
. noone suspense occurs infact yhe dream sequences eather becuase eveyr single noe ofthe them isnt obviously a dream sequence fomr its insepsion
. if hte gool ofthe teh babysitter wass tothe be humourous
, hten it aslo fails
. i foudn nothing even remotely funny baout hte boozing parents who seemed
, at times
, tothe be palyed forthe laughs
. if hte gool ofthe thte babysitter ws tothe be dramtic
, thn
, once agina
, it fails
. thge cahracters are oen
- dimesnional anbd uninteresting
. finaly
, if tjhe gool ofthe thge babysitter wass tothe be titillating
( hte tipe ofthe film destiend tothe be palyed ad infinitum onthe hbo at 2 infront thte morning
)
, thne it fails as well
. teh dream sequences aren
' t erotic
; tehy are too breef annd
, outside ofthe noe vrey short scene
, contain noone nudity
. i cant
' t completelyl trash thsi movei
. thge frist 10 mintues or so vaguely ressemble an intresting film
, annd yhe conclusion sportscar a halfway decent fistfight
. thte otehr 79 mintues
,
though
, are a drag
. silverstone
' s chracter
, at teh end ofthe hte movei
, turns tothe her boyfriend adn asks
" waht weere ytou thingking
?
" i asked mysef hte smae question
, hvaing spended 99 cents renting htis tureky
