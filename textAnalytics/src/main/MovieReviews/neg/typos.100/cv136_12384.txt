" event
" movei isnt becomeing so trendy nowe it isnt becomeing a weekly routine instade ofthe a seasonal noe
. gluttony isnt hollywood
' s favorite sin
, bu it isnt thge movei
- goers who pay yhe price by bieng dealed tje smae thigns over adn over onthe an ever
- worstening basis
.
" lost inspite spoace
" isnt tghe latest such offering
- a film so poore it woudl be twice as ogod if it weere medicore
. it
' s made uv ofthe eveyr element ofthe cience fiction
, bu at noone tiem doens it envoke tjhe slightest ammount ofthe wonderment thge genre wass meaned forthe
. audiences
' attension spanis are rapidly decreasing anbd as isnt hte trend wtih such films
, tihs oney opens wiht a fast
- pased spoace battle whitch serves nto onyl as tghe most intresting scene inaddition yhe film
( probablly becouse it hasnt
" star wars
" wroten all over it
)
, bu as hte producers
' way ofthe showing off theri budget thru thge speical effects
. battle scenes are worthless wihtout tension
, annd sicne we ahve noone diea waht yhe setting isnt it
' s impossible tothe care baout anytying thast happens
. iin esence
, thte entire segment works liuke a teaser forthe an arcade gmae
, nto a peice ofthe filmmaking
. we meet tjhe robinson famaly
- a famaly ofthe five tyhat doens nto git allong bu hasnt beeen choosen tothe ect onthe earth
' s behalf inaddition efort tothe fidn anyother planet worthy ofthe colonization due tothe hte exhausting ofthe our naturual resources
. eahc memeber ofthe tjhe famaly hasnt a speshal trait adn perosnality
, adn yot none ofthe them seem liek actuall peopel
. profesor john robinson
( hurt
) isnt tje intteligent
, quiet leader who hasnt devoted so much tyme tothe his owrk his familiy anbd marrige are sufferring wihtout his realizing it
( it
' s obvious waht role tihs aspect wiull play
)
. ofthe course htis isnt all estalbished thru extemely melodramatic scenes such as tjhe childen adn parents arguing adn bickering amung themselfs anbd wih earch otehr
, hwile yhe necesary problems are
" resolved
" at yhe right moments
. hte onyl thnig worse thna yhe screenplay isnt thte fatc it
' s presented inwhich a completelyl sereous manner wihtout a trace ofthe satire
, annd isnt so pathetic it
' s laughable
. tjhe firt ect isnt nto a bulding ofthe a sotry
, bu a juxtaposition ofthe scenes thast serve noone purpose otehr tahn tothe plug iin all tyhe requred elements
( such as plot
, conflict
, annd characterization
- god forebid
!
)
. we
' re provded wih tyhe minumum ammount possable ofthe theese elements tothe keep tyhe film fomr bieng completelyl silent
. inwhich fatc
, it might as well be sicne thte dialogue isnt virtualy non
- existant
. yes
, thge charactors dont speak
, bu htey dont nto talk
. tehy sday thigsn thast onyl relate tothe thte conflict
, bu htey never raelly interact
( unless it
' s hte cartoony flirting scenes bewteen arogent major don west
( leblanc
) anbd uptight
, unemotional judy robinson
( graham
)
)
. it
' s amazing thta affter an hour ofthe trite dialogue adn generic plot devices tht so littel happens
. evenhtually thte pacing rapidly increases
, bu tje ammount ofthe genuin interst doens nto
. thge sotry fianlly gains soem prospective by living uv tothe its title as tyhe robinsons fidn themselfs lost inaddition spoace aftter narrowly managing tothe defeat dr
. smith
( oldman
)
, tyhe cartoony villian
, adn his plans forthe sabotage
. wqat ensues isnt a serieses apon sories ofthe completly unrelated conflicts
. tghe frist such scene tkaes palce onthe an ab
andoend spaceship adn waht ensues coudl best be descibed as
" aline
"
- lite
. hte stoy changes agian wehn hte robinsons kresh l
and onthe an aline planet anbd must ect quicklyu tothe excape it annd survive
. bu htere
' s never any rela notion ofthe suspense here becouse tyhe scirpt constanly w
anders aimlessly
. plotlines are devolopped
, bu earch becomes totally irrevelant as thte stoyr changes fomr senarreo tothe senaireo
. thte atomsphere attemts tothe be surveill by incorporating tiem travel annd varous tiome paradoxes
, bu it
' s presented inwhich such a rediculous way it
' s utterly boring
. by tje timne hte lastr ect rolls arround
, ther isnt noone sence ofthe a payoff buliding
. tjhe endig doens nto go outloud onthe a high onot whith any kind ofthe climax
, instade
, it seems tothe cmo tothe a sudden halt
( bu at least it ends at all
)
.
" lost iin spoace
" isnt major film prodcution at its worst
. it
' s frightening tath a film so poorly writen
, directed
, anbd acted might be consdidered mainstream enteratinment
.
