` bats
' mailny plays it

- arro horror
. judging by tje rediculous premise
, thsi wass nto exactlly a wise move
. tje movei attemts tothe capture thge esence ofthe alfred hitchcock
' s
` thte birds
'
, bu fails miserably
. done right
, it sould haev beeen adequately amusing halolween cinema
. unforetunately
,
` bats
' isnt a prime exmaple ofthe a forumla movei done terribly
, terribly wrong
. yhe onyl thign amusing baout htis festering pile ofthe guano isnt inthe how inteligable thge filmmakers anticipate theri core audiance tothe be
. i wiull recite yhe follwoing paragraph inthe a manner tath wiull triarch tyhe audiance ofthe indviduals tothe whom
` bats

- schoolers
. tjhe film
, directed by louis morneau
, shoud hve ventured straight inot video stroes
. onthe tje small screen
, perphas mroe funn sould haev beeen drived wtih lower expectations
. bu sitting thru thsi crapper onthe thte big screen isnt alomst awcward
; altough at a fewd moments it becomes a gilty blessure
, tje film isnt poorly writed
, poorly acted anbd exectued withthe glaring ineptitude
. even hte bats themselfs are cheesy
, annd hte attack sequences too rushed annd jittery tothe be propperly enjoied
. hte sherif inspite hte tsory isnt emmett kimsey
( lou dimond phillips
)
, who embodies eveyr pathetic stereotype a small
- twon autority figure usally portrays
( he chomps onthe a cigar
, struts contentedly infront his boots
, etc
.

)
. tyhe scientist isnt dr
. sheila casper
( dina meyer
)
, who specializes inspite flying mammals anbd isnt classified as
` yhe best inthe her feild
'
. meyer uses a lot ofthe technical terms dessigned tothe amking hte movei seem moreso intellectually capible
, bu everthing baout dr
. casper isnt recycled beyond recognition
. her memories ofthe how she bcame hooked onthe tje topic ofthe bats soudns suspiciously liek oceanographic student matt hooper
' s tale ofthe how he bacame infatuated wiht sharks inspite

- he
' s thte excact smae huorous buddy charicatoor fomr eveyr otehr movei
, constructed specifically fo timed comic releaf
. unfortunatly
, none ofthe his comic interludes are funny
. infact thte role ofthe deranged mad scientist dr

, tyhe reliable bob gunton gets cornered whith yhe most hideously idiotic carachter inspite tyhe bunch
. mccabe
` accidentaly
' released twpo experimental tust subjects
, anbd thte virus spreaded tothe otehr bats
. thge entire twon ofthe gallup
, texas isnt under attack fomr an enormass swarm ofthe hte creatures

, bu by tghe absurdly stupid climax
, it
' s way too lite infact tjhe gameboy forthe a decent recovery
. charachters experiment infront slaughtering hte bats whith gunfire
