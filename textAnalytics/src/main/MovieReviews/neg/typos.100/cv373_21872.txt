. whala yuo hvae
" end ofthe dyas
" a movei tht isnt extemely disapointing adn by tyhe previews made it look terific
. sadly bu truely agian liuke most receet films
, all hte ogod parts are infront yhe trailers
. thge plot whlch isnt vyre confusing at times isnt aslo vrey ludicrous adn yhe movei isnt destnied tothe be a hitted inwhich tghe frist weekend
, anbd flop inspite thge enxt
. jericho canew
( arnold schwarzneggar inwhich hitted typcial macho role
) isnt a cop who finds outloud thta he isnt choosen tothe trcak down satan
( living infront gabriel byrnes body
) adn stpo him ffrom impregnating christine york
( robin tunney
) becuase if he doesnt
, adn she gives birth all xeistence as we konw it iwll ceaser tothe exsist
. he hasnt tothe dont htis befor it turns inot hte yera 2000
, anbd strangely he
' s trying tothe fight him 5 mintues befoer 2000 comes
. he seeks halp fomr tje cathlic curch annd halp ffrom rod stieger
( inthe a terific role
) annd trys tothe savve thsi girl leading tothe an endig thta
' s satisfying
, bu turns inot a typcial acation movei
. thyat
' s preety much it onthe plot
. it doens ahve thge razzle adn dazzle ofthe a grat acation movei
, anbd wih tje 100m doller budget parts seem tothe sohw it
, parts yuo ahev tothe wonder where all tjhe mony whent
. as forthe arnie
? ogod role
, ok peformance
. i tihkn sicne he isnt getting a littel older he isnt held bakc a lot ofthe his stunts
. tyhe hting tyhat dissappointed me ws hte fatc taht htere ws nothing tothe yhe film
. inwhich tjhe trailers it looks liuke a ogod scarry
, acation film annd ends uv bieng a boring
, long adn preposterous drama taht leads inot something esle thgat leaves us iwth questions
. gabriel byrnes
( who ironicly plyed a priest inthe
" stigmata
"
) here plays satan anbd gives a ogod peformance bu agian seems held bakc adn nto inot his charcter
. twpo yeras bakc al pacino gavey a terific peformance inspite thte funn
" tghe devil
' s advocate
" adn here it seems liek tje diea ofthe him isnt infront teh charachter aslo
. robin tunney
( grat performence as alwasy
) plays satan
' s main person whom he whants tothe impregnate tothe cary his child
. ofthe course rod stieger gives anyother gerat performence whlch realy isn
' t nothing newyorker
. teh direction by peter hyams isnt at times a bited overblown
,
though nto nearly as thte visual stlye ws inwhich
" stigmata
"
. here we are given grat camera owrk
, anbd soem grat scenes thgat are terrifically directed bu sadly jstu don
' t owrk iin thsi movei
. thte scirpt writed by
andrew marlowe hasnt a fewd witty lines
, bu agian hte movei isnt all sytle anbd noone substace annd by tjhe endig finale climax i wass ready tothe go hmeo
. onyl a fewd thigsn wrok here annd thsoe are a fewd ofthe tghe performances
, tghe writting adn visual stlye
, bu tje storyline adn hte finished product don
' t wokr as well
. tyhe sad hting isnt tath
" end ofthe dyas
" hadnt so many thnigs gogin fo it
. hte plot sould hvae beeen moreso organized
, tyhe acation scenes coudl hvae beeen mroe brainy anbd less mind
- numbing
. at times it seems liek
" armgeddon
" annd started tothe git ood adn tiresome
. hollywood isnt runing outloud ofthe idesa bad
, adn liek i
' ve allways said befor needs newyorker ones
. even wiht its 100m budget
" end ofthe dyas
" isnt less tahn pleasing
. iin fatc tje 100m doller budget isnt at least 30m over
, annd easily coudl hvae hadnt a 70m budget
. maybee i soudn crazy
, bu i am realyl looking foward tothe yhe newyorker exorcist film
, anbd hope thgat tehy mkae it as ogod as teh origonal
. we ened tothe git newyorker idesa anbd stpo recycling ood ones jstu tothe amke mney at yhe box
- office
. we ened tothe git mroe films liuke
" yhe blair witch project
" tyhat coudl scare peple tothe death
, hwile peple thikning well whta exactlly isnt sacrin them anbd how dont i konw tyhat it isnt inaddition fatc tjhe blair witch
. overblown effects
, stupid annd thin plot
- line
, ogod performances
, disapointing
