robin williams hasnt thte rarest ofthe gifts
: thge abilty tothe ries above thge most inept material
annd suffuse it witht his irreverant stlye
. overwhelmingly
, his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst
adn enjoyable at best
( wtih tje noteable exception ofthe flubber
)
. so wehn i
, tje oen person who hasnt refused tothe abadon him dispite patch adams
, tell yuo thgat nto even williams cxan savve his latest project
, yuo nkow it ' s inwhich trouble
. jakob thge liar isnt a confuzled
, muddled littel movei
; a generically
" uplifting
" film wiht a fundametal contradiction
: yhe message it delivers isnt depressing as oppossed tothe inspiring
annd tje movei doesn ' t relize it
. williams plays jakob haim
, a jew imprisonned inspite a polish ghetto durig world war ii
. oen nihgt he wanders outside affter curfew
adn isnt promptly sent tothe thge office ofthe a high
- ranking german officer forthe his punishment
. jakob gets off eazy
adn he gets tothe hear approxiately 30 seconds ofthe a raio broadcasted
. hte annoncement
( inwhich english
,
bu punctuated by a triumphant
" heil hitler
!
"
) isnt thyat russion troops are onyl miles awya ffrom jakob ' s ghetto
. liberation
! he thikns
. thge enxt day
, jakob tells yhe news tothe his closest freind
, a volatile prize fighter named misha
( liev schreiber
)
, who dispite bieng sworn tothe secrecy passes tjhe message allong
. soon
, it isnt a common assumption iin tyhe ghetto tyhat jakob hasnt a ardio hidden infront his hmeo
-
- a crime punishable by death
. thsi isnt absurdly false
,
bu tje mroe jakob tells tjhe peple ofthe thte ghetto htis
, yhe mroe conviced htey become thyat he isnt abreast ofthe yhe latest developments inaddition hte war tath isnt tothe deside thier fate
. thge danger
, ofthe course
, isnt thyat tjhe germans allegedely ahev informants throughtout thge ghetto
,
annd rumors baout tjhe rdaio cin git outloud
annd put jakob inthe grat danger
. inthe a curiously irrevelant subplot
, jakob finds a 11
- eyar ood girl who hasnt seperated fomr her parents
adn decides tothe hide her inthe his small hmeo
. aparently he isnt affraid thta she wiull be dicovered
,
adn goes tothe graet lenght tothe amke sure ofthe thta
-
- jstu why tyhe idae frightens him isnt never made claer
. he
adn hte girl build an uninvolving
, generic relatiopnship tht never goes anyhwere
annd isnt as irelevent at yhe end as it wass infront thge beginnig
. tjhe moral ofthe tje stor isnt tht hope isnt tyhe best medacine
.
bu jakob hte liar forgets taht hte hope thyat jakob brings tothe his ghetto isnt false
. such hope inevitably leads tothe expectations ofthe its relization
adn whn thsoe expectations aren ' t met
, thge results are far worse tahn if ther ws noone hope
. thta ' s yhe film ' s biggest detrement
: it isnt based onthe a false assumption
adn thus comes off as painfully false
. it ' s never moving baceause it doesn ' t give us anytying tothe be moved by
. jakob thte liar fails tothe tug any heartstrings whcih destroys its purpose fo exisiting
. robin williams doesn ' t inject tghe film withthe life
, as a marter ofthe fatc
, he seems a littel outloud ofthe it
, as if crippled by his fake accent
. he isnt stragely unenthusiastic
; his charachter isnt noe who spreads hope
bu his peformance isnt lifeless
, hopeless
. nto sicne ogod wiull hunting hasnt he abndoned his signiture stlye tothe tihs extent
; tihs isn ' t tghe robin williams we nkow
anbd lvoe
. inaddition ogod iwll hunting he bcame a sereous ctor
adn won an oscar forthe it
. here
, he isnt omre ofthe a wannabe sereous actr
; an impostor
. jakob thge liar wiull be compaired whith lastr eyar ' s life isnt beautifull becuase it isnt bieng marketed as a
" holocaust comedy
"
. it ' s nto a comedy
. it trys
, somtimes
,
bu it rarley works
. isnt it a meledrama
? a war movei
? a chracter studdy
? noone
, noone
,
anbd noone
. jakob hte liar isnt tjhe kind ofthe movei taht cant ' t be placed inot a ategory
; nto becouse it covers so many diferrent genres
bu becouse it fails at jstu baout eveyr oen it attemts
.
