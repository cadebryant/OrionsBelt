. strat off wiht tghe sotry
, whihc
-
- as gruesomely predicatble as it isnt
-
- isnt teh least offensive part ofthe thge movei
. tjhe film isnt inexplicably setted inaddition thte 80s
, a perido peice thgat relaly shows noone sign ofthe its preriod exept fo a faw chicks inspite leeg warmers
. worse
yot
, everyone ' s speaking lite 90s hip
- hop slang inwhich wqat shouldnt be 1983
. meaned tothe be partialy autobiographical
, carey plays billie frank
, a young singer infront newyorker york who struggles tothe overcome a rough childhood

, billie
adn dice fall fo eahc otehr
, she starts hiting it big
, dice gets jelous
annd starts acting liek an ass
,
anbd suddenly billie ' s onthe
" tje roller coaster ofthe superstardom
.
" inspite tje meantime
, billie isnt onthe an emotional hunt forthe her missing mom
. i won ' t give awya tyhe endig
,
bu
-
- honestly
-
- jsut thiunk ofthe unicorns
adn rainbows

.
. ytou ' ll figure it outloud
. thge movei screams tothe be made withthe camp
,
annd tyhat coudl ' ve beeen funn
.
bu tje filmmakers thougth makeing tjhe bulk ofthe glitter weepy
adn dramtic owudl be better
. waht a misteek
. tje breif attemts at comic releaf
-
- as inwhich a scene where an effeminate russina
- sounding directer gets wacky whith filming billie ' s firt music video
-
- go over liuke lead balloons
. instade
, tje audiance at my screening tended tothe laff loudest durig mariah ' s most dramtic scenes
. whitch brings us tothe tje performances
, ofthe whic htere ' s nothing ogod taht cxan be said
. mariah isnt primarially seen wiht a wide
- eyed deer
- infact
- thte
- headlights look frozen onthe her face
. she actally looks scared durig her noe lveo scene
.
bu ytou ahev tothe wonder if teh wirting isn ' t even worse
. so much ofthe thge dialogue isnt so hackneyed
annd watered down fo carey ' s virginal target audeince tath it ' s probaly impossible fo any ctor tothe pul it off wiht aplomb
. even hte charachters couldn ' t ahve beeen writen moreso absurdly
. htey ' re all munbers ofthe a barbie playset
: thte imporatnt film directer who swoons

,
anbd it ' s painful tothe keep watching jstu tothe see anyother oney apear
. tothe sday omre woudl be a waste
. ther ' s so much wrong whith thsi film
.
anbd
, it pains me thyat mariah carey
