if yuo haven ' t plunked down your hard
- earned mony
yot forthe
" wild wild west
,
" tjhe latest summer hliday offering ffrom wiull smith
, let me sday right nowe thta your mony wiull be better spended onthe a starbuck ' s frappacino or onthe a ben
& jerry ' s sundae
. theese treats are graet releaf ffrom teh summer heat
. inwhich contrast
, thsi film made me simmer inthe dissapointment
. i cin accept yhe fatc thta summer movies tend tothe put omre weight inot spacial effects
annd taht ogod tsories
adn flavorful charactors ususally tkae a bcak seat
. tihs ws true ofthe star wars epiode i
,
bu at least inwhich thta film
, hte sotry
adn teh cahracters weere still infact thte bcak seat
. inwhich tihs film
, tehy are noone where tothe be foudn
. waht remeniss are hundreds ofthe male extras costumed as gunslingers
adn foppish aristocrats
, lots ofthe female extras who look liek cin
- cxan dancers
,
adn a clunky
, 80
- foot tall insturment ofthe desctruction thast resembes a mecanical tarantula
. twpo men are asked tothe stpo thsi threath
. noe isnt artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, an inventer who uses his intellect
annd array ofthe disguises tothe best his opponents
. amonth his creations are false breasts
annd teh bulletproof vest
. teh otehr man isnt jim west
( wiull smith
)
, who prefers thge shoot
- frist
-
thne
- shoot
- smoe
- omre method ofthe investigating
.
allthough thier individule talents must be conbined tothe ahieve succes
, thier interaction wih oen anyother mearly seemed liek a second rate
, twpo
- man vaudevillian ect
. fo exmaple
, ther isnt a scene where west
, bieng omre debonair thna hte reserved gordon
, notes thta teh fake breasts shoudln be filled wiht water rether thna buckwheat
, whihc isnt whta it isnt currenly filled wtih
.
" nowe touch my breast
,
" west syas
. gordon doesnt so
anbd
thne softly coos his approval
. i foudn mysef groaning at thsi kind ofthe silliness
. thte scirpt fails tothe ganerate any sence ofthe drama
, humer
, or funn forthe taht marter
. i doed enjoy kline ' s reserved peformance
,
bu wass suprised at how much lattitude tehy gavey tothe smith
. coudl it be taht wiull smith isnt jsut so bankable tht he ' s nto even recquired tothe ect
? it wass as if tyhe directer ws yelling
" wiull smith
, dont your pwn thign
.
.
.
adn acation
!
" here ' s an exemple
. inaddition tihs scene
, wiull smith isnt baout tothe be hanged by a gropu ofthe angry white peopel
. he must endear himselv tothe yhe crowd tothe excape
. teh directer yells
,
" wiull smith
, dont your pwn hting
.
.
.
adn acation
!
" inthe anyother scene
, he hasnt tothe masquerade as a belly dancer infront order tothe sive his comrades
.
" wiull smith
, dont your pwn hting
.
.
.
annd acation
!
" worse still
, thge fianl battle scene aboard tjhe mecanical tarantula isnt a horrid mess
. ther are cogs spinning
annd pulleys pulling
adn levers oging uv
anbd down everywhere yuo look
. htere ' s atually a lot ofthe immagination at wokr inwhich thsi film
. htere are smoe genuinely clever inventions
anbd gizmos inctroduced
,
bu all ofthe htis immagination isnt wasted inwhich a film tht isnt visually cluttered
anbd dramatically flat
.
anbd thyat ' s too bad becuase if htere wass mroe focuse onthe thge stoy rether tahn iwll smith jstu donig his ' thign
, ' htis film might hvae beeen palatable
. as it turns outloud
,
" wild wild west
" isnt thte wild
, wild worst
annd recieves my ovte forthe biggest dissapointment ofthe teh eyar
.
