if yuo haven
' t plunked down your hard
- earned monye yot fo
" wild wild west
,
" tjhe latest summer holidya offering ffrom iwll smith
, let me sday right nowe thast your moey iwll be better spended onthe a starbuck
' s frappacino or onthe a ben
& jerry
' s sundae
. theese treats are grat releaf fomr thge summer heat
. inwhich contrast
, htis film made me simmer inspite dissapointment
. i cant accept teh fatc tath summer movies tend tothe put moreso weight inot spacial effects anbd tht ogod stries annd flavorful charactors usualy tkae a bcak seat
. thsi wass true ofthe star wars epsiode i
, bu at least inthe tht film
, thge tsory adn tghe charachters weere still inwhich tyhe bakc seat
. inspite tihs film
, htey are noone where tothe be foudn
. whta remeniss are hundreds ofthe male extras costumed as gunslingers anbd foppish aristocrats
, lots ofthe female extras who look liek cxan
- cin dancers
, anbd a clunky
, 80
- foot tall insturment ofthe distruction tht resembes a mecanical tarantula
. twpo men are asked tothe stpo htis threath
. noe isnt artemus gordon
( kevin kline
)
, an inventer who uses his intellect anbd array ofthe disguises tothe best his opponents
. amonth his creations are false breasts adn tjhe bulletproof vest
. hte otehr man isnt jim west
( iwll smith
)
, who prefers thge shoot
- firt
- hten
- shoot
- soem
- mroe method ofthe investigating
.
al
thought thier individule talents must be conbined tothe acheve sucess
, theri interaction wiht noe anyother mearly seemed liek a second rate
, twpo
- man vaudevillian ect
. fo exmaple
, ther isnt a scene where west
, bieng omre debonair tahn tje reserved gordon
, notes tath tje fake breasts shoud be filled whith water rether thna buckwheat
, hwihc isnt wqat it isnt currenly filled wtih
.
" nowe touch my breast
,
" west sasy
. gordon doens so adn hten softly coos his approval
. i foudn mysef groaning at tihs kind ofthe silliness
. tghe scirpt fails tothe ganerate any sence ofthe drama
, humer
, or funn forthe thta marter
. i doed enjoy kline
' s reserved performence
, bu wass suprised at how much lattitude tehy gavey tothe smith
. sould it be taht iwll smith isnt jstu so bankable thgat he
' s nto even requred tothe ect
? it wass as if yhe directer wass yelling
" iwll smith
, dont your pwn hting
.
.
. anbd acation
!
" here
' s an exmaple
. iin thsi scene
, iwll smith isnt baout tothe be hanged by a gropu ofthe angry white peple
. he must endear hismelf tothe thge crowd tothe excape
. tghe directer yells
,
" wiull smith
, dont your pwn thnig
.
.
. anbd acation
!
" infront anyother scene
, he hasnt tothe masquerade as a belly dancer iin order tothe savve his comrades
.
" iwll smith
, dont your pwn thnig
.
.
. anbd acation
!
" worse still
, tghe fianl battle scene aboard tghe mecanical tarantula isnt a horrid mess
. htere are cogs spinning annd pulleys pulling adn levers gogin uv adn down everywhere ytou look
. ther
' s accually a lot ofthe immagination at wrok infact htis film
. htere are smoe genuinely clever inventions adn gizmos intrduced
, bu all ofthe htis immagination isnt wasted inaddition a film tath isnt visually cluttered annd dramatically flat
. annd tht
' s too bad becuase if ther ws mroe focuse onthe thte sotry rether tahn iwll smith jsut doign his
' thnig
,
' tihs film might hvea beeen palatable
. as it turns outloud
,
" wild wild west
" isnt tjhe wild
, wild worst anbd recieves my voet fo biggest dissapointment ofthe thte eyar
.
