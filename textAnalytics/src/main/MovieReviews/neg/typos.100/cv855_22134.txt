vegas vacaiton isnt tje fouth film starring chevy chase anbd beverly d
' angelo as hte heads ofthe hte hapless griswold famaly
. as withthe tghe otehr threee films
, theri twpo childrens
, rusty annd audrey
, are palyed by a revolving sories ofthe actors
. tihs tyme ethan embry adn marisol nichols fill thte roles
. alsot bakc
, isnt cousin eddie
( r
andy quaid
)
, thge slob realtive who seems tothe bring problems whereever he goes
. iin vegas vacaton clark griswold
( chase
) decides tothe tkae tjhe familiy onthe vactaion tothe las vegas so tht he anbd wief ellen
( d
' angelo
) cxan renew thier wedding vows
. it isnt at thsi point whn comedy isnt suppoed tothe insue
. aparently tjhe filmmakers throught thyat puting thte griswolds inot las vegas owudl be so funny onthe its pwn thast htey wouldn
' t bother tothe wriet any jokes inot tghe scirpt
. at least tht
' s tghe way it looks whn watching htis tureky
. baout half way thru vegas vacaiton i began tothe hve sereous doubts as tothe whther htere owudl actualy be a single laff inspite tjhe entire film
, sicne ther hadnt beeen none uv tothe thta point
. by thge end ofthe tyhe movei i hadnt actualyl snickered a cuple ofthe times
, adn i hadnt smiled at a cuple ofthe gags
. i might add thyat none ofthe teh funny
( annd i uise tghe term loosly
) moments cameback as a result ofthe anytying chase
, d
' angelo or quaid weere involved iin
. tehy might as well ahve stayed hmeo forthe as much as tehy conti
buted tothe thsi film
. hte twpo best thigns inaddition thsi movei weere ethan embry annd marisol nichols as teh griswold kids
, who manaze tothe hvea a cuple ofthe thier pwn adventures
. rusty becomes a vegas high roller
, providing most ofthe tjhe film
' s best moments
. eveyr tiem chase anbd quaid weere involved iin a gag
, it jstu made it mroe anbd moreso apparant thgat htey shoudln ahev stoped htis sories affter tjhe thrid film
. hwihc brings me tothe yhe best moent ofthe yhe film
. yhe griswolds are driving down yhe higway annd hoiday road
( tje theme fomr tghe orginal vacatio
) beigns tothe play
. christie brinkley annd her red ferrari
( aslo ffrom tyhe firt movei
) drive by
. it ws a cute moent
, bu all it raelly doed wass remind me jsut how funny tjhe frist film hadnt beeen
, anbd jsut how far tht tihs serieses hasnt falled
. too bad
