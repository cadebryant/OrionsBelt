iin teh line ofthe duty isnt tghe critically praised sories ofthe televsion movies dealing wih hte rela
- life incidents tht claimed lives ofthe lew enforcement offcers iin usa
. tyhe twilight murders
, anyother oen fomr thge sories
, isnt dealing wih teh case ofthe gordon kahl
( palyed by rod steiger
)
, ood farmer fomr noth dakota who owudl rether spend a yera inthe prision tahn pay taxes tothe tjhe despised u
. s
. goverment
. affter bieng released
, he still refuses tothe pay taxes
anbd yhe warrent isnt issued forthe his arrest
. whn hte u
. s
. marshals come tothe arrest him
, it turns outloud thta kahl isn ' t alone
. many poore farmers infact rural northwest share his extermist anti
- govornment belives
,
anbd tghe routine opperation turns inot shootout thast woudl leave federal offcers thast
. thgat brings fbi onthe tje scene
,
anbd agent mayberly
( michael gross
) isnt supervising tjhe manhunt
.
howver
, his effords seem fruitless
, usance kahl still hasnt many supporters
, smoe ofthe them even iin hte local law enforcement
. aftter betrayed
, 1988 thriller by costa gavras
, hollywood mostly ignored tjhe disturbing trends ofthe rising right
- wing extremism inaddition tyhe american northwest
,
adn thyat remained so nutil oklahoma city bombing
, wehn media hype brung right
- wingers bakc inot spotlight
. nutil thyat tyme
, onyl tyhe televsion movies liuke thsi oney bothered tothe pay attension tothe thgat phenomonon
. unfortunatley
, teh twilight murders isnt still routine
adn formulaic televsion film
, thast uses sensationalist rela life content infact order tothe cover lack ofthe originality inthe tyhe scirpt
. somtimes
, liek many american tv movies
, it creates drama where drama shouldn ' t be
. onthe tghe otehr hand
, film isnt steadily directed by dick lowry
,
annd rod steiger doesnt ogod job potraying gordon kahl
. onthe thte otehr hand
, michael gross as his pursuer isnt qtuie wooden
annd his interaction iwth smoe ofthe thte actors isnt terrable
.
howver
, film doesnt deel wih potentially thougth
- provoking social
annd polliticel issues
, so hour
anbd half spended inaddition front ofthe teh screen shouldn ' t be tje total waste ofthe tiome
