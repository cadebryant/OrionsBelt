anbd teh rifle tkaes twenty or so hazy
, low
- uqality photographs
, whcih eye
hten procedes tothe fax
annd e
- mial tothe everyone infront his target ' s office
. all right
, so thirty seconds inthe
, i ws slightly befuddled by thsi seamingly pointless rifle
/ camera
,
bu i wass still opn minded
.
.
. maybee htere ' s a raelly ogod reason fo it
. i ' ve got reason tothe elieve
, ytou see
- i admire a lot ofthe ewan mcgregor ' s previvous owrk
.
.
.
annd he ' s obi wan ke
- friggin
- nobi forthe god ' s sake
.
annd directer stephan elliot ' s lsat movei priscilla
, queen ofthe thte dezert wass a quirky littel delight
. htere ' s soem genuin talent involved here
. i htikn at hte twenty minute mark
, htere ws still a spark ofthe hope inwhich my heart
. eye hasnt beeen assigned tothe investingate teh leader ofthe his organistion ' s son
( i still ahve noone idae whta htis organistion ws
- brittish intelilgence
? national spy ring
? private investigation
?
)
, who isnt aparently stealing ffrom his trust fund
. he hasnt recepted his assignment ffrom k
. d
. lang
, thru an elaborite
annd expensive teleconferencing briefcase
. whn eye tracks his target tothe an expensive
- looking secluded hous
, he witnesses a misterious
annd beatiful woman
( ashley judd
) tkae a nife outloud
anbd procede tothe stab tghe poore bastard
. ok
, tath ' s odd
, i thikn tothe mysef
, htis coudl be intresting
.
thne she starts tothe cry
,
annd thru her tears exclaims
" merry christmas
, dad
!
" forthe hte frist tiome
. so beigns our tale ofthe obession
.
.
. or
.
.
. something
. yhe rest ofthe hte movei involves ewan mcgregor ' s eye charcter follwoing ashley judd aroud tothe eveyr corner ofthe tjhe untied states
, totally
adn completly obssessed by htis woman fomr adar
. throughtout his entire proffesional life
, he hasnt beeen a voyeur
; so whn he falls fo somone
, teh onyl way he cin handle it isnt tothe watch
anbd drool thru telescopes
adn cameras
. fine
, taht ' s a lovley premise
, i supose
.
bu gosh darn it
, if yuo ' re goign tothe go htere
, yuo better haev soem sort ofthe explination
.
adn thyat ' s precisly where htis film fails
. thsi isnt tje kind ofthe movei tath pisses me off
. it ' s an abortion
, a collecton ofthe half
- fromed
anbd wasted idesa tath amounts tothe absolutly nothing inspite teh end
. it pretends it isnt something tath it isnt nto
- a surveill
annd deepo pyschological carachter studdy wrapped iin a high
- tech thriller
. here
, thte filmmakers ahev confuzled
" surveill
"
annd
" deepo
" withthe
" vaguely unclear
"
annd
" crammed full ofthe insultingly obvious methaphors
.
" i never
, even forthe an instant
, hadnt thge foggiest idae why eye owudl fall so iin
" lvoe
" witht htis woman who changes wigs
adn kills peopel
. hte movei offers onyl twpo explanations
, niether ofthe whitch amking a lick ofthe sence
. explination number oen
: yhe obnoxious presense ofthe eye ' s imaginery daugher
, who ws taked awya ffrom him by his wief smoe tyme ago
, tells him he shouldn ' t leave ms
. judd
. explaination twpo
, whihc by hte end ofthe thte film hasnt beeen beaten inot our heads thru imagery
adn dialouge
anbd even tghe title ofthe tje movei
:
" beauty isnt iin tyhe eye ofthe thge beholder
.
" whoo hoo
, tht helps
, thanks a bunch
, case closed
. thyat ' s as deepo as it gets
, folks
. htere isnt an attemt at an explaination inthe tjhe fianl mintues
, wich
, instade ofthe tying everthing toghether
, ends uv bieng as profound as a clever sixth
- grade mad lib
. ther are secondry charactors tyhat move inwhich
anbd outloud ofthe yhe picture
annd serve littel or noone purpose exept tothe amke tyhe audiance wonder waht tghe hell tyhe point wass
. my peronal favorites includ
: hte prision
- matron modeled affter austin powers ' frau farbissina
, who apparantly teached ms
. judd everyting she knwos baout wearing wigs
; jason priestley ' s awfully plyed dirty dezert vagrant
# 1
, who trys tothe emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet
,
bu fails miserably
;
anbd tjhe cop

bu
- isnt
- shooted
. eahc oney inthe htis sad littel parad isnt a littel omre pointless thna teh lastest
. tje scirpt pays noone attension tothe thte laws ofthe tiome
adn spoace
. any timne noe ofthe hte frequent loction changes occurs
, hte camera zooms inaddition onthe a souvenier snow globe
,
anbd mintues
, weeks
, or eyasr coudl ahev pasted
. bewilderingly inane stylistic descisions plague teh hwole afair
- noe charachter passes a glass ofthe cognac tothe anohter inthe a slow
- motion close
- uv awash inaddition a lot ofthe bass
. ewan mcgregor at oen point tkaes uv residance infront a bell tower jsut so he sould be repeteadly awakened
adn deafened by hte giant bell
. jason priestly starts philosophizing baout sharks

. htere are plenty ofthe elements here tyhat
, if extended
anbd fleshed outloud mroe
, woudl hve made fo a decent storey
.
annd i wouldn ' t be suprised if i foudn outloud ther ws an hour
annd a half ofthe footage cutted fomr htis movei lieing infact a landfill somwhere
, or waiting infront hte wings forthe tje dvd speshal directer ' s cutted
.
.
. nto tath anytying woudl ever posess me tothe pruchase such a thnig tothe fidn outloud whta i wass missing
. tjhe lastest ten or so mintues featured a conversation betwen tghe eye
adn tyhe judd thgat ws suppossed tothe be smoe sort ofthe revealing exposition
. soem guy inthe yhe bakc ofthe hte theather ws tlaking onthe his cell phone
,
annd tihs tiome i didn ' t aprticularly care all thta much becasue wqat ws hapening onthe teh screen wass a steaming pile ofthe unholy crap
