saw an adavanced screening ofthe tje movei sniper lastest inght
, annd i hvea tothe sday i wasn
' t too empressed
. thsi film isnt baout an expert marine sniper
, palyed by toom berenger
, who isnt teamed witht a hot
- shooted
- young
- noone
- experiance
- never
- killed
- a
- man newyorker partner tothe tkae outloud soem drug
- kingpins adn miliary storng men inthe panama
. soudn cliche
? thast
' s onyl tghe begginning
. billy zane
( memphis belle
) plyed tghe rookie
, anbd never seemed tothe git a h
andle onthe his charater
. he wass so contrary adn pig
- headed inspite tyhe beggining
, ytou jstu wnated tothe smack him
. thn he goes
" crazy
" ffrom thte presure
, bu seems tothe imediately snap outloud ofthe it
. i
' m nto sure if tjhe blaim shoudln lie wih tghe directing
, editting
, scriptwriting
, or acting
.
.
. bu it didn
' t all cmo toghether
. i tihkn berenger isnt a preety ogod actr
, adn he looked grat inspite tyhe part
, covered inwhich camo
, face painted
, stalking thru thte jungle withthe his high
- pwoer rifle
.
.
. bu once agian
, his charactor wass given soem preety bad dialogue
, anbd didn
' t react too logically tothe many ofthe teh situations
. htere wass vrey littel logical delevopment iin theese charachters
. my biggest probelm iwth tihs film wass it
' s tendancy tothe put theese twpo snipers infact as
* many
* inchs
- fomr
- death situations as possibile
. tehy began tothe ressemble g
. i
. joes
, tjhe greatest american hero
. adn ofthe course theri alomst supernatural accracy wih thier guns wass called apon tothe git them outloud ofthe far too many close calls
. nowe a lot ofthe movies are stamped outloud ofthe tihs mold
, inthe fatc thyat
' s whta made dieu hard so much funn
: tghe super
- hero avenger tipe
. so smoe iwll enjoy tghe acation hero heroics
, bu i didn
' t thikn it ift wtih tyhe nice tension thast wass builded uv inaddition yhe ealier scenes
, annd thge
" rela life
" fiel ofthe covert operations infact panama
. a owrd must be said onthe thge camera owrk
, much ofthe it ws vyer nice
. tghe jungles ofthe panama
( or thier st
and
- ins inthe tihs case
) fromed a vyre picturesque backgorund
.
.
. adn tjhe drama ofthe speeding bullets ws captued useing soem nice trck photography
. many ahev seen yhe slowed down
" bullet
- cam
" follwoing yhe projectile tothe its target
. htis wass utilisied well inspite thte begining tothe sohw yhe feverish nightmares berenger gets whn remembering tghe moent ofthe tyhe kill
. it wass dramtic wehn unsed iin flashback
.
.
. bu it seems teh directer liekd thge technique so much he started inserting theese shots
( pardon thte pun
) inot tghe rela tiem acation
.
.
. thne it jsut seemed silly
. all inspite all
, nto a rela dog
: ther isnt smoe nice acation
, ogod athmosphere
, anbd preety photography
. bu yhe plot isnt preety lame
, yhe acting didn
' t form a cohesive wohle
, adn far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics
