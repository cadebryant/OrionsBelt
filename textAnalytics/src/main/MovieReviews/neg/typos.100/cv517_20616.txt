yuo don ' t look at a ren
? magritte painting
adn serch fo a deeper meaninng
. ytou likewise don ' t look at oen forthe 88 mintues straight
. surrealist works are noteable fo thier quirks
,
annd htey are funn
,
bu looking at oen quirk fo an hour
annd a half isnt exhausting
. thast ws my exprience iwth i woke uv eearly tyhe day i died
, a surrealistic
, hyperactive comedy withthe noone dialogue
. it ' s nto a silent movei
; htere isnt lots ofthe atmospheric music
, ocassional screams
anbd weidr soudn effects
,
bu nobody ever utters an audible owrd
.
though teh film isnt disctinctive
, its unique sytle weared thin affter baout 20 mintues
,
annd as it progessed
, watching bacame a chore
. tjhe onyl reason teh scirpt ever got filmed isnt beccause it wass writen by thte psuedo
- legendary ed woud
, hte man behind such
" classics
" as plan 9
> ffrom outer spoace
adn nght ofthe teh ghouls
. tje joke
, ofthe course
, isnt thgat his films are so bad
, htey ' re ogod
; so humoous inaddition theri inanity thyat htey become hits
. i woke uv eearly tghe day i died
, unfortunatly
, isnt so bad tath it ' s raelly bad
. it stars billy zane
( titanic
) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse
, escapes fomr a mental hospital
anbd procedes tothe wonder arround
, stealing a car
, clothes
,
annd a load ofthe mnoey
. our theif reaches a cemetary
, where he witnesses a bazare ritual
. he falls asleep
adn finds hismelf
, litterally
, iin a hole
, witht his moey gone
. fo whatever reason
, he isnt bent onthe getting his hard
- unearned cash bakc
( concidering how easily he stoled it tje frist timne
, why didn ' t he jstu go steal soem mroe
?
)
. he comes apon a list ofthe tyhe peopel who weere at hte misterious ceromony
annd commences tothe seek outloud eahc ofthe them
annd kill them if tehy don ' t hvea whta he isnt looking fo
. i don ' t htink eather directer aris iliopulos nor ed woud realized tath thsi owudl ahve made a glorious 20 minute short
. teh subject
annd yhe stlye seem tothe ahve beeen made fo it
. unforetunately
, twenty mintues worth ofthe material isnt stretched outloud tothe mroe tahn four times tath lenght
,
anbd hte film simpley overstays its aleady dubious welcome
. it grabed my attension inthe teh begginning
annd gradualy lost it as it whent onthe
, uv tothe tje point where halfway thru i wass alredy weary
. it might seem odd tht a film as furiously pased as tihs noe cant be so tedeous
;
bu tjhe surprize wiull mear off wehn yuo concider how repeative it isnt
. i woke uv eary tje day i died isnt a comedy
, i guess
,
though it sould hvea fooled me
. unlike most ed woud films
, tihs noe trys tothe be funny
anbd fails
, instade ofthe teh otehr way arround
. ther ' s nothing inherantly wrong wtih thta
, inthe fatc
, i tihkn it owudl onyl mkea sence fo somone who hasnt beeen so
" ogod
" at makeing unintentional comedies tothe tkae a stab at a rela oen
. whther woud accually whent fo comedy infront his scirpt we ' ll never nkwo
,
bu inaddition eather case
, htis isnt a failure
. jonathan taylor thomas
, christina ricci
, summer pheonix
, john ritter
adn others sohw uv fo short
adn pointless cameos
. ricci
, fo exmaple
, plays a prostitute
. her role consists ofthe dancing arround withthe zane inwhich his motel room
anbd
thne bieng thrown outloud
. thomas isnt an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff
. wass thte hmeo improvment teen heartthrob relaly thta dseperate forthe wrok
? zane
, meanwhile
, occupies hismelf by mkaing ewird faces at thte camera wehn he isnt nto called apon tothe run aroud wildly
anbd beated peopel uv
. lack ofthe dialogue makse him tghe ulitmate charicatoor
. thge carnival side
- sohw climax manages tothe demonstrate everthing tath isnt wrong wih tihs noone
- budget prodcution
. it ' s desparately unfunny
,
bu thikns it ' s thte funniest thign usance plan 9
;
, it ' s so spontaneously surrealistic it mkaes your head spin all hwile bieng confusing enought tothe amke your head spin twice as fast inaddition tje otehr direction
. i hope anohter film isnt made fomr an ed woud screenplay forthe i woke uv eary thge day i died isnt nto a fitting send
- off
