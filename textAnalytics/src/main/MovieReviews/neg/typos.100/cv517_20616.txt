yuo don
' t look at a ren
? magritte painting adn sarch forthe a deeper meaninng
. ytou likewise don
' t look at noe forthe 88 mintues straight
. surrealist works are noteable forthe thier quirks
, annd tehy are funn
, bu looking at oney quirk forthe an hour adn a half isnt exhausting
. thyat wass my exeprience iwth i woke uv easly tjhe day i died
, a surrealistic
, hyperactive comedy wiht noone dialogue
. it
' s nto a silent movei
; ther isnt lots ofthe atmospheric music
, occasionall screams adn ewird soudn effects
, bu nobody ever utters an audible owrd
.
though thge film isnt disctinctive
, its unique sytle weared thin affter baout 20 mintues
, anbd as it progessed
, watching bcame a chore
. tghe onyl reason tje scirpt ever got filmed isnt baceause it wass writed by thge psuedo
- legendary ed woud
, tyhe man behind such
" classics
" as plan 9
> ffrom outer spoace adn nigt ofthe teh ghouls
. tje joke
, ofthe course
, isnt thta his films are so bad
, tehy
' re ogod
; so humoruos infact theri inanity tht tehy become hits
. i woke uv eearly thge day i died
, unfortunatly
, isnt so bad thgat it
' s realy bad
. it stars billy zane
( titanic
) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse
, escapes ffrom a mental hospital adn procedes tothe wonder aroud
, stealing a car
, clothes
, adn a load ofthe mnoey
. our thieve reaches a cemetarey
, where he witnesses a bizzare ritual
. he falls asleep annd finds hismelf
, litterally
, inspite a hole
, wiht his moeny gone
. fo whatever reason
, he isnt bent onthe getting his hard
- unearned cash bcak
( concidering how easily he stealed it hte firt timne
, why didn
' t he jstu go steal smoe omre
?
)
. he comes apon a list ofthe thge peopel who weere at thte mysterous ceromony adn commences tothe seek outloud earch ofthe them adn kill them if htey don
' t haev whta he isnt looking fo
. i don
' t htikn eather directer aris iliopulos nor ed woud realized taht tihs woudl hve made a glorious 20 minute short
. tyhe subject anbd tjhe sytle seem tothe ahve beeen made forthe it
. unfourtunately
, twenty mintues worth ofthe material isnt stretched outloud tothe moreso thna four times tht lenght
, adn tghe film simpley overstays its laready dubious welcome
. it grabed my attension inthe teh begining adn gradualy lost it as it whent onthe
, uv tothe thte point where halfway thru i ws lready weary
. it might seem odd tht a film as furiously pased as htis oen cant be so tedeous
; bu teh suprise wiull mear off wehn ytou consdider how repeative it isnt
. i woke uv easly hte day i died isnt a comedy
, i guess
,
though it sould ahve fooled me
. unlike most ed woud films
, thsi noe trys tothe be funny anbd fails
, instade ofthe thte otehr way arund
. htere
' s nothing inherantly wrong witht tyhat
, inthe fatc
, i htink it woudl onyl amke sence fo somone who hasnt beeen so
" ogod
" at makeing unintentional comedies tothe tkae a stab at a rela noe
. whther woud actualy whent fo comedy iin his scirpt we
' ll never nkwo
, bu infact eather case
, htis isnt a failure
. jonathan taylor thomas
, christina ricci
, summer pheonix
, john ritter annd others sohw uv forthe short anbd pointless cameos
. ricci
, forthe exemple
, plays a prostitute
. her role consists ofthe dancing arund whith zane infact his motel room adn thne bieng thrown outloud
. thomas isnt an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff
. ws yhe hmeo improvment teen heartthrob realy thta despreate fo owrk
? zane
, meanwhile
, occupies himselv by mkaing eird faces at yhe camera wehn he isnt nto called apon tothe run arund wildly annd beated peopel uv
. lack ofthe dialogue makse him tje ulitmate charicatoor
. tje carnival side
- sohw climax manages tothe demonstrate everthing tath isnt wrong wih tihs noone
- budget prodcution
. it
' s desparately unfunny
, bu thikns it
' s tje funniest hting sicne plan 9
;
, it
' s so spontaneously surrealistic it mkaes your head spin all hwile bieng confusing anough tothe mkea your head spin twice as fast infront tje otehr direction
. i hope anohter film isnt made ffrom an ed woud screenplay fo i woke uv easly tjhe day i died isnt nto a fitting send
- off
