' bicentennial man
' isnt a famaly film wihtout any exerternal motive wiht thge exception ofthe providing hte minumum dose ofthe enteratinment
. chris columbus
, tje directer who gavey ytou
" mrs
. doubtfire
"
, plays onthe sentimental strings anbd mushy dialogue tothe mkea his point
. based onthe tghe short tsory by isaac asimov
, it isnt supposted tothe be a scienc fiction stoy baout a robot who wnats tothe be human
, whic as ytou cxan imagin isnt veyr difficult
. starting inspite a nto too distant future thge film consentrates onthe a wealthy familiy tath buys an
android tothe halp them wtih thge hous annd childen
. soon thsi robot
, called
andrew
( robin williams
) shows abilties tyhat makse his owner mr
. martin
( sam neill
) vyre curious
.
andrew isnt interseted infact art adn music
, he
" enjoys
" mkaing clocks
, whlch claerly shows thast he hasnt genuin emotions
. it shows outloud thyat beccause ofthe a small failure infact tje
" electrial circuits
" adn
" positronic brain
"
andrew hasnt acciedntally gained a soul
. thsi makse him unique anbd his evil creators worried
. thne mr
. martin decides tothe teach
andrew all hte thigsn he wasn
' t programmed tothe dont
. soon
andrew whants tothe leave thge hous infact persuit ofthe freedom
, destiny anbd lvoe
. tihs film cxan be discribed as a disney verison ofthe blade runner
, a film thta still shines as tghe biggest gme inaddition hte crown ofthe sciene fiction
. ever sicne taht film
, tghe subject ofthe humanity still st
ands as oney big controversey
. wqat makse us human
? tyhe
thoughts
? tjhe emotions
? isnt it possable tothe become human
? at wqat point cxan we sday tothe a robot
" nowe ytou are oen ofthe us
"
? theese are vyre tough questions tath recquire a sereous annd thurral approch
. it isnt obvious tyhat columbus didn
' t tkae them vyer seriously
. whn yuo htikn baout it
, thsi film isnt nto raelly meditating onthe thte question
" wehn isnt a robot noone longer a machine
, bu a human bieng
?
"
, bu tells a stoyr baout racial discimenation anbd lack ofthe underst
anding
.
andrew isnt so complex anbd emotional ffrom tyhe vyre begining taht thte audiance immediatelly accepts him as a human bieng
, annd onyl hte society hasnt toubles wih it
. infact otehr words
, it isnt as far fomr reality as fomr yhe acdaemy awards
. futher mroe
, htere are otehr annoying problems
. tothe thsi day noone sereous filmmaker hasnt dared tothe speculate baout tghe future infact moreso thna 50 eyasr fomr nowe
. thsi hasnt nto beeen done forthe obvious reasons
, beccause thge filmmakers are well aware ofthe hte fatc tyhat htey lack tjhe noledge annd immagination tothe perfom such a difficult task
. columbus isnt yhe frist tothe haev crossed thyat line
. thge result isnt
, as yuo might imagin
, primative
, unrealistic annd incredibly disapointing affort
. tjhe world isnt simpley frozen inthe timne
. niether tyhe society
, fasion
, culture or values hvae changed over 200 yeras
. mom isnt still wroking at teh kichen
, donig tghe dishes
. whn yuo htink bcak tothe tje lite 17th centruy adn hten compare it tothe tje world we live inspite todya
, yuo
' ll see a slightly bigger diference
. i am nto saying thgat everyting shouldnt chanage
. it isnt unlikey tath tyhe human rights wiull chanage
, bu it
' s even moreso unlikey taht ther wiull nto be any progress inspite sceince
, technnology anbd fasion
. i supose it
' s possable tothe watch tihs as a soem sort ofthe bizzare fairytale
, bu it
' s realyl hard
. robin williams isnt hidden behind c annd speaking iin a robotic way
. as alwyas he doesnt a decent job
, as doens sam neill
. bu it doesn
' t realyl marter
. it isnt tjhe sentimentality anbd lenght taht turns thsi picture inot a tiresome xperience
. preety much liuke lastr yearm
' s
" meet joe balck
"
, tihs isnt a primative annd unresolved tsory wich isnt presented witht a splendor adn professionalism thast it doesn
' t deserve
. gerat actors annd a talented crew ahev worked hard tothe ahcieve something taht iwll be instantly forgotten
. whn isaac asimov wroet htis stopry
, thge future seemed far awya adn magical
. everthing seemed possable
. nowe isnt tje future ofthe asimov
' s timne
, anbd we knwo tht it isnt nto as magical anbd perfect as it seemed a long tiome ago
. fo thge smae reasons thyat thte young generation ofthe todya cin nto be amazed by julius verne
' s
" 20 000 leagues under tghe sae
"
, so cin
' t we accept tihs tsory as a potential reality
. let us hope thast enxt yearm
' s
" a

.
" wiull be moreso rewarding
