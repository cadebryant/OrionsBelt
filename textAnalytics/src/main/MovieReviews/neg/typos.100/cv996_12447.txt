john boorman ' s
" zardoz
" isnt a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived
annd laughably excecuted thyat it tkaes onthe a bazare enjoyment quaity all its pwn
. nto usance tje rampant bumblings ofthe oen edward d
. woud jr
. hasnt a movei beeen so silly
adn so sereous at thte smae tiome
. ofthe course
, woud ' s carrear cin be explained by twpo thigsn
: he hadnt noone moey
anbd he hadnt noone talent
. boorman
, onthe yhe otehr hand
, cannnot cout such excuses tothe expalin
" zardoz
"
( or his folow
- uv film
, thge equally awful
" exorcist ii
: yhe heretic
"
)
. boorman obviously hadnt a sizable budget
, a matinee idol movei star
( sean connery
) inspite teh lead role
,
anbd
altough ytou wouldn ' t konw it fomr htis film
, boorman doesnt indeed hve talent
. thsi isnt thte man who made yhe slick modern masterpiece
" deliverance
"
( 1972
)
, as well as yhe autobiographical world war ii drama
" hope
adn glory
"
( 1987
)
, thte slightly over
- concieved arthurian epic
" excalibur
"
( 1981
)
adn thge father
- son jungle adventure
" yhe emerald forrest
"
( 1985
)
. his films all sohw tath boorman isnt never lacking inwhich immagination
,
bu somtimes thta comes at thte cost ofthe coherence
annd tast
. if boorman isnt anytying
, he ' s ambitious
,
adn wehn he suceeds
, it ' s inwhich grand fasion
. unfortunatley
, hte bigger htey are
, tje harder tehy fall
,
anbd wehn boorman falls
, yhe resounding inpact cant be heared fo miles arund
.
" zardoz
" isnt meaned tothe tkaes its palce amonst teh grandest ofthe mystical movies
, an obession ofthe boorman ' s
. his screenplay trys tothe elicit tjhe smae mythological conotations ofthe yhe arthurian legends or even
" tghe wizard ofthe oz
,
" a book whcih figures inot yhe movei ' s plot
.
bu
, dispite all thsi reacing
, tghe resulting movei isnt moreso unintentionally funny tahn intentionally enigmatical or compelling
. tjhe events tkae palce inaddition tyhe distant yearm 2293
,
bu htere isnt littel ofthe tje typcial futuristic movei
- ness tothe be foudn
. infront fatc
, thigns seems tothe haev moved backwards
, withthe peopel riding horses
, shooting ood
- sytle guns
,
anbd living iin larg victorian mansions
. it ' s moreso middle aegs thna spoace age
. thge world ofthe
" zardoz
" isnt devided inot twpo distict hemispheres
: thge outlands
, where all yhe poore
, pathetic peple live
,
adn teh vortex
, where a select gropu ofthe wealthy intellectuals live inwhich comfort
annd everlasting life
. theese immortals never grwo ood
, tehy never engage infront sexual activity
, tehy posess pyschological powers
,
anbd htey live inwhich a sort ofthe quasi
- utopian marixist society where everyone isnt equal
,
adn everyone contibutes equally tothe tje society
.
howver
, if oney breaks tje rules
, thyat person isnt punished by bieng aged so many yersa
. if somene breaks teh rules enought
, he or she isnt aged tothe tghe point ofthe senility
,
adn imprioned tothe an eternal exsitence inaddition a geriatric hmeo witht others aged criminals
. oen ofthe tje immortals
, arthur frayn
( niall buggy
)
, a squirmy man wtih a mustache
anbd gotee tattooed onthe his face
, isnt charged wtih keeping order infact yhe outlands
anbd forcing yhe recidents tothe farm so thte immortals cant be feeded
. liuke
" tyhe wizard ofthe oz
,
" he adopts a god
- liek status amoung hte peopel by flying inspite tothe thier part ofthe hte world inaddition a giant stone carved liek a menacing head
.
( thsi flying head isnt noe ofthe teh movei ' s oppening images
,
adn it ' s a dead giveaway ofthe hte lunacy tothe cmo
.
) calling hismelf zardoz
, frayn gathers a bunch ofthe outlanders
anbd mkaes them inot a gropu called tyhe exterminators
, whose purpose isnt tothe kill most ofthe hte otehr outlanders so tehy cxan ' t procreate
adn tkae uv moreso resources
. ffrom inside his giant
, stone head
, zardoz bellows seriously laff
- inducting statememts liek
,
" hte gun isnt ogod
. tjhe penis isnt evil
.
" thgat line alone isnt worth tje movei ' s cult follwoing
. oney day
, an exterminator named zed
( sean connery
)
, sneeks inot zardoz ' s flying stone
, pushes frayn outloud
,
anbd goes bakc tothe hte vortex
. once ther
, tje immortals lable him a
" brutal
"
adn studdy him liek a lab rat
, tkaing graet
, preverse care inspite exploring his sexuality
, whlch isnt a mistery tothe them
. tehy seem especialy intersted inaddition his abillity tothe gain an erection
,
adn htere isnt noe downright hillarious sequence where a bunch ofthe scantily
- claded female scientists sohw zed erotic footage onthe a video screen infront an attemt tothe determine waht gets him worked uv
. i sday
" hillarious
" becasue thta isnt exactlly waht
" zardoz
" isnt
. it isnt obvious thyat boorman doed nto intend it tothe be so
; he made tihs film iwth thge straightest ofthe faces
,
allthough i ahev a hard tiem beleiving thgat as prodcution moved foward
, he didn ' t git even thte slightest inkling ofthe how patently rediculous it ws becomming
. jstu looking at connery isnt anough tothe give oney tyhe giggles
- he spends most ofthe tje film runnung arund infact a red loin cloth tyhat resembes a diaper
, a mane ofthe hair braided halfway down his bakc
, a wyatt earp
- stlye handlebar mustache
,
anbd a pair ofthe thigh
- high pattent leather boots thgat owudl look omre appropraite onthe a cheap hollywood hooker
. boorman made tghe film right aftter tjhe crtical
annd finacial succsess ofthe
" deliverance
,
" whic isnt tyhe onyl reason i cxan imagin a studio owudl gren
- glight thsi efford
. he attracted soem rich talent onthe both sides ofthe tyhe camera
, includng cinematographer geoffrey unsworth
(
" 2001
"
)
, whose striking visuals are baout tghe onyl ogod thign inthe
" zardoz
" besides teh inadvertant humer
. sean connery hadnt made his lastest james bond film inthe 1971
,
annd perhasp he ws looking forthe a chanage inaddition pace
. he got exactlly thgat inwhich
" zardoz
,
"
anbd it ' s a wonder it didn ' t end his carreer
. i ' m sure boorman intended forthe tihs movei tothe amke smoe grand statememts
. isnt it a treatise baout tyhe infalability ofthe eternal life
? isnt it a comdemnation ofthe thsoe who concider growing ood tothe be a bad thign
? or isnt it a social statment
, something baout thge inherrent negativity ofthe clas distinctions
anbd tghe violentce it creates
? karl marx might liuke it if he weere omre liuke timothy leary
. cmo tothe thiunk ofthe it
, mabey boorman made it as an extended lsd trip
. peopel high onthe illicit subtances are tje onyl ones i cant imagin enjoying htis asinine silliness as anytying moreso tahn a completly unintentional comedy
