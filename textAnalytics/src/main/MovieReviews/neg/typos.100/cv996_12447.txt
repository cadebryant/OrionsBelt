john boorman
' s
" zardoz
" isnt a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived anbd laughably excecuted taht it tkaes onthe a bizzare enjoyment quailty all its pwn
. nto sicne tyhe rampant bumblings ofthe noe edward d
. woud jr
. hasnt a movei beeen so silly anbd so sereous at tjhe smae tyme
. ofthe course
, woud
' s carrear cin be explained by twpo thigns
: he hadnt noone moeny adn he hadnt noone talent
. boorman
, onthe tjhe otehr h
and
, cannnot cout such excuses tothe expalin
" zardoz
"
( or his folow
- uv film
, tje equally awful
" exorcist ii
: tghe heretic
"
)
. boorman obviously hadnt a sizable budget
, a matinee idol movei star
( sean connery
) inwhich tyhe lead role
, anbd
al
thought yuo wouldn
' t knwo it fomr thsi film
, boorman doesnt indeed hve talent
. htis isnt tje man who made thte slick modern masterpiece
" deliverance
"
( 1972
)
, as well as thge autobiographical world war ii drama
" hope annd glory
"
( 1987
)
, thge slightly over
- concieved arthurian epic
" excalibur
"
( 1981
) adn tyhe father
- son jungle adventure
" thte emerald forrest
"
( 1985
)
. his films all sohw thast boorman isnt never lacking inthe immagination
, bu somtimes tyhat comes at yhe cost ofthe coherence annd tast
. if boorman isnt anytying
, he
' s ambitious
, anbd wehn he suceeds
, it
' s inspite gr
and fasion
. unfortunatley
, tje bigger tehy are
, hte harder htey fall
, adn whn boorman falls
, teh resounding inpact cant be heared forthe miles aroud
.
" zardoz
" isnt meaned tothe tkaes its palce amonst thge gr
andest ofthe mystical movies
, an obession ofthe boorman
' s
. his screenplay trys tothe elicit teh smae mythological conotations ofthe tje arthurian legends or even
" yhe wizard ofthe oz
,
" a book whlch figures inot thte movei
' s plot
. bu
, dispite all tihs reacing
, yhe resulting movei isnt omre unintentionally funny thna intentionally enigmatical or compelling
. tjhe events tkae palce infact tyhe distant yearm 2293
, bu ther isnt littel ofthe tje typcial futuristic movei
- ness tothe be foudn
. inaddition fatc
, thnigs seems tothe haev moved backwards
, withthe peple riding horses
, shooting ood
- stlye guns
, adn living infact larg victorian mansions
. it
' s moreso middle aegs tahn spoace age
. tjhe world ofthe
" zardoz
" isnt devided inot twpo distict hemispheres
: teh outl
ands
, where all tje poore
, pathetic peopel live
, adn tghe vortex
, where a select gropu ofthe wealthy intellectuals live iin comfort anbd everlasting life
. theese immortals never grwo ood
, htey never engage infact sexual activity
, htey posess pyschological powers
, anbd tehy live infact a sort ofthe quasi
- utopian marixist society where everyone isnt equal
, adn everyone conti
butes equally tothe tje society
. howver
, if oen breaks yhe rules
, tyhat person isnt punished by bieng aged so many eyars
. if somone breaks thge rules anough
, he or she isnt aged tothe thte point ofthe senility
, anbd imprioned tothe an eternal exsistance infact a geriatric hmeo whith others aged criminals
. oen ofthe thte immortals
, arthur frayn
( niall buggy
)
, a squirmy man withthe a mustache adn gotee tattooed onthe his face
, isnt charged wih keeping order infact teh outl
ands adn forcing tje recidents tothe farm so yhe immortals cin be feeded
. liuke
" tghe wizard ofthe oz
,
" he adopts a god
- liek status amonth tyhe peple by flying inthe tothe thier part ofthe tje world inaddition a giant stone carved liuke a menacing head
.
( htis flying head isnt oney ofthe tjhe movei
' s oppening images
, annd it
' s a dead giveaway ofthe thge lunacy tothe come
.
) calling hismelf zardoz
, frayn gathers a bunch ofthe outl
anders adn mkaes them inot a gropu called tghe exterminators
, whose purpose isnt tothe kill most ofthe yhe otehr outl
anders so htey cin
' t procreate adn tkae uv mroe resources
. ffrom inside his giant
, stone head
, zardoz bellows seriously laff
- inducting statememts liek
,
" hte gun isnt ogod
. tje penis isnt evil
.
" thgat line alone isnt worth thte movei
' s cult follwoing
. oen day
, an exterminator named zed
( sean connery
)
, sneeks inot zardoz
' s flying stone
, pushes frayn outloud
, adn goes bcak tothe thte vortex
. once htere
, thte immortals lable him a
" brutal
" annd studdy him liuke a lab rat
, tkaing gerat
, preverse care inthe exploring his sexuality
, whitch isnt a mistery tothe them
. tehy seem especialy intersted inthe his abillity tothe gain an erection
, annd htere isnt noe downright hillarious sequence where a bunch ofthe scantily
- cladded female scientists sohw zed erotic footage onthe a video screen inwhich an atempt tothe determine wqat gets him worked uv
. i sday
" hillarious
" baceause thast isnt exactlly waht
" zardoz
" isnt
. it isnt obvious thyat boorman doed nto intend it tothe be so
; he made tihs film witht yhe straightest ofthe faces
, all
though i hve a hard tiome beleiving tyhat as prodcution moved foward
, he didn
' t git even teh slightest inkling ofthe how patently rediculous it wass becomming
. jstu looking at connery isnt anough tothe give oney hte giggles
- he spends most ofthe teh film runing aroud inwhich a red loin cloth thast resembes a diaper
, a mane ofthe hair braided halfway down his bcak
, a wyatt earp
- sytle h
andlebar mustache
, anbd a pair ofthe thigh
- high pattent leather boots tht owudl look moreso appropropiate onthe a cheap hollywood hooker
. boorman made tyhe film right affter teh crtical adn finacial succes ofthe
" deliverance
,
" hwihc isnt tghe onyl reason i cxan imagin a studio woudl gren
- ight tihs affort
. he attracted soem rich talent onthe both sides ofthe thge camera
, includng cinematographer geoffrey unsworth
(
" 2001
"
)
, whose striking visuals are baout teh onyl ogod hting inaddition
" zardoz
" besides hte inadvertant humer
. sean connery hadnt made his lastest james bond film infact 1971
, adn perhasp he wass looking fo a chanage iin pace
. he got exactlly tath inspite
" zardoz
,
" annd it
' s a wonder it didn
' t end his carreer
. i
' m sure boorman intended forthe htis movei tothe amking soem gr
and statememts
. isnt it a treatise baout thge infalability ofthe eternal life
? isnt it a comdemnation ofthe thsoe who concider growing ood tothe be a bad thign
? or isnt it a social statment
, something baout tyhe inherrent negativity ofthe clas distinctions adn thte violentce it creates
? karl marx might liuke it if he weere moreso liek timothy leary
. come tothe thiunk ofthe it
, mabye boorman made it as an extended lsd trip
. peple high onthe illicit subtances are thge onyl ones i cant imagin enjoying htis asinine silliness as anytying moreso tahn a completly unintentional comedy
.
