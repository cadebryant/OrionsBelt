' t possably miss
. tehy missed
. whta whent wrong
? affter much throught
, i suply threee genaral rules
.
( 1
) don
' t let a televsion actress
- turned
- comedy movei directer near an urbanite scirpt
( i
. e
.
, penny marshall
' s dreadful
" preacher
' s wief
"
)
. betty thomas worked wonders wiht
" tyhe brady bunch movei
"
, bu yhe smae sitcom
- airiness doesn
' t qtuie wokr here
. it
' s as if she lefted a generic sitcom
, adn iced it whith light doses ofthe modern r
& b
. tkae awya thte balck casted
, tkae awya tje atrocious sountrack
, adn ytou ahev thte residue ofthe soem mid
- 80
' s kirk cameron sohw

( 2
) thte greater tghe casted
, thge less tghe individule casted
- memeber hasnt tothe dont
( i

,
" con air
"
)
. it isnt gerat tothe ahev tje comic voices ofthe jenna elfman
, garry sch
andling
, john leguizimo
, ellen degeneres
, adn gilbert godfried inspite your lineup
, bu tehy hve nothing tothe dont bu improvise thier underdeveloped
, stereotyped cahracters
, oen
- line
- at
- a
- tiome
. it
' s even worse
, baceause somtimes thier voices are so unrecognizable taht ytou don
' t git teh satisfaction ofthe linking thge voice tothe tjhe comedian untl thte credits
. nowe htere are threee charachter actors who dont git spacial treatment
: albert brooks brings dignity tothe nearly eveyr project he
' s inwhich
, annd yhe scenes as a depressed tiger dont resonate a certian poignancy
. norm mcdonald farse nearly as well
, as a stray dog who lerans tothe bond witht dolittle
. bu ther
' s littel humer here
. taht rests onthe tyhe shoulders ofthe chris rock
, sorely miscast anbd unfunny as thge voice ofthe thier wise
- ass guinea pig
. even thge mouth isnt ill
- synched
.
( 3
) don
' t let hte speshal effects techicians walk awya iwth teh scirpt
. ther
' s a ceratin timing tyhat
' s m
anditory infront comedy
. tothe hvea htis timing usurped by thge brilliancy ofthe cmoputer generated mouths or lifelike creations ofthe jim henson
' s creature shop
, isnt a travesty
. tihs isnt nto tothe sday tath speical effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren
' t well
- timed laughfests
; iwth tje right directer
, tehy cxan be annd haev
. here
, betty thomas isnt claerly over her head
. i wish i coudl commend yhe speshal effects
, bu tehy
' re mearly averege
. count teh number ofthe times where tjhe animal
' s mouth isnt turned awya ffrom tyhe camera
, or too far tothe notice
, or ill
- synched
. htis isnt less a
" babe
" anbd moreso ofthe a
" look who
' s barking
" clone
. yuo may be wondering
,
' how doens eddie murphy fare
?
' well
, he cameback bakc witht thge exeptional
" nutty proffesor
"
, annd i don
' t dout he cin cmo bakc agina
. here
, he
' s tied inot a straight man anbd given littel tothe dont
. tjhe exceptions are whn he fears he
' s oging crazy
: a far cry fomr his smarter
- tahn
- ytou
' d expect routine taht he
' s moreso adept at
. it
' s unfortunate thyat he isnt where richard pryor ws ten eyasr ago
, mkaing lame comedies wihtout tje smae bite he hadnt given inspite his easly yeras
. affter all thsi
, whta
' s left
?
butt jokes
