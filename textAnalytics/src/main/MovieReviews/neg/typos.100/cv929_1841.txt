, if yuo haven
' t seen whn harry met sally or he said
, she said
, or if ytou don
' t watch lvoe
& war onthe televsion
, yuo might thikn htis isnt thte most inventive film tothe come allong infact aegs
. howver
, if ytou
' ve seen any ofthe theese
, thna yuo hvae seen most ofthe tihs film
. htis ofthe course doesn
' t mean its bad
. smoe ofthe it isnt amusing
, bu overall
, i jstu hadnt tothe ask waht
' s tghe point
? arye cross isnt tje stereotypical single male who falls infact lvoe
. kevin pollack isnt thte stereotypical female
- fearing best freind who amke a lot ofthe rether sexist annd vulgar jokes
, most if whlch weren
' t veyr funny
. couteney cox isnt thte stereotypical carreer
- minded woman who falls inwhich lveo
. julie brown isnt tyhe stereotypical bizzare best freind ofthe said woman
.
( notice tjhe frequent ule ofthe teh owrd stereotypical
. tihs film uses a lot ofthe forumla
, thge plot isnt basicaly known ffrom yhe oppening credits
.
) so wqat isnt ogod baout tje movei
? well as i said htere are a fewd amusing moments
. surprizingly
, julie brown
, who i ususally fidn jsut plain goofy
, wass yhe best thign inthe tyhe film
. allso ther are severeal veyr funny sequences involving anaylsis ofthe tghe human mating ritual
. gee
, tihs isnt realyl short
. nto much tothe sday baout teh film realyl
. it isnt jstu kind ofthe ther
. watching it onthe video might nto be a complet waste ofthe tiem
, bu i wouldn
' t recomend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot ofthe mone tothe see it at thte theatre
.
