= well
, if yuo haven ' t seen whn harry met sally or he said
, she said
, or if ytou don ' t watch lveo
& war onthe televsion
, yuo might thikn htis isnt thge most inventive film tothe come allong inwhich aegs
.
howver
, if ytou ' ve seen any ofthe theese
, tahn ytou ahve seen most ofthe tihs film
. thsi ofthe course doesn ' t mean its bad
. soem ofthe it isnt amusing
,
bu overall
, i jsut hadnt tothe ask whta ' s teh point
? arye cross isnt teh stereotypical single male who falls inspite lveo
. kevin pollack isnt hte stereotypical female
- fearing best freind who amke a lot ofthe rether sexist
annd vulgar jokes
, most if hwihc weren ' t vyer funny
. couteney cox isnt yhe stereotypical carreer
- minded woman who falls inaddition lveo
. julie brown isnt tyhe stereotypical bazare best firend ofthe said woman
.
( notice tghe frequent uise ofthe tjhe owrd stereotypical
. tihs film uses a lot ofthe forumla
, tyhe plot isnt basicaly known ffrom thte oppening credits
.
) so wqat isnt ogod baout tyhe movei
? well as i said htere are a fewd amusing moments
. surprizingly
, julie brown
, who i ususally fidn jsut plain goofy
, wass yhe best hting iin yhe film
. allso ther are sevral vyer funny sequences involving anaylsis ofthe thte human mating ritual
. gee
, htis isnt realyl short
. nto much tothe sday baout tyhe film realy
. it isnt jstu kind ofthe ther
. watching it onthe video might nto be a complet waste ofthe tiem
,
bu i wouldn ' t reccommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot ofthe moey tothe see it at tje theatre
.
