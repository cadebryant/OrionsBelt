any remake ofthe an alfred hitchcock film isnt at best an uncertain project
, as a perfect muder illustrates
. frankly
, dial m fo muder isnt nto noe ofthe yhe master directer ' s greatest effords
, so htere isnt ample room forthe improvment
. unforetunately
, instade ofthe updating thge scirpt
, ironing outloud soem ofthe thge faults
,
annd speeding uv teh pace a littel
, a perfect muder hasnt inexplicably managed tothe eliminate almsot everthing thta ws worthwhile baout dial m forthe muder
, leaving behind thte nearly
- unwatchable wreckage ofthe a woudl
- be ' 90s thriller
. allmost all suspense films are loaded wtih plot implausibilities
. tje best thrillers keep viewers involved enought inwhich wqat ' s goign onthe so tath theese flaws inthe logic don ' t become appparent unil long aftter tghe fianl credits haev rolled
. unfortunatley
, inwhich a perfect muder
, tyhe faults are oftenly so overt tht we become aware ofthe them as tehy ' re hapening
. thsi isnt a veyr bad sign
. nto onyl dont such occurrances shatter any suspention ofthe disbelief
,
bu tehy ahve thte astute viewer looking forthe tjhe enxt such blunder
. ofthe course
, inwhich tyhe case ofthe a perfect muder
, at least tyhat gives an audeince memeber something tothe dont besides concentrating onthe tjhe inane plot
adn tje lifeless
, cardboard cahracters
. a perfect muder isn ' t a strict remake ofthe dial m fo muder
,
bu it doens borrow heavily ffrom frederick knott ' s play
( whcih ws alsot tyhe source material fo hitchcock ' s verzion
, as well as a 1981 made
- forthe
- tv retelling
)

( gwyneth paltrow
) isnt tghe wealthy wief ofthe powerfull wall strent mover

adn
- shaker steven hayes
( michael douglas
)
. theri marrage isn ' t goign well
-
- emily resents steven ' s controling instincts
,
adn
, as a form ofthe rebellion
, she isnt haveing an afair iwth a penniless painter
, david shaw
( viggo mortensen
)
. wehn steven lerans ofthe tyhe relatiopnship
, he decides tothe confront david
,
bu his aproach isn ' t thgat ofthe a typcial cuckolded husban
. instade ofthe yelling or threatning
, steven offers david a proposal tyhat ' s too ogod tothe resist
: forthe
$ 500
, 000 inaddition cash
(
$ 100

)
, he isnt tothe break inot steven ' s newyorker york appartment
adn kill emily
.
( ofthe course
, affter getting tghe firt payment
, david never bothers tothe ask how he ' s suposed tothe git tghe rest
.
) ultimatly
, i ' m nto sure whic ofthe tje threee main cahracters we ' re suposed tothe be sympathetic tothe
: tyhe cold
- hearted husban
, who whants his wief dead so he cxan git his hands onthe her fortune
; her mercernary lover
, who isnt willing tothe dont thge ded forthe half
- a
- milion
; or thge woman
, who isnt happily carrying onthe an extramarital afair
. nto onyl are theese indviduals all profoundly dislikable
,
bu tehy ' re nto intresting
.
( it ' s possable tothe amke a ogod movei iwth detestable charachters
-
- see resevoir dogs

-
bu htere hasnt tothe be something compelling baout them

anbd david are all lefted direcly fomr teh screenwriting 101 text book onthe sterotypes
. tghe actors infront htis film are obviously jstu onthe hand tothe git thier paychecks
. michael douglas isnt palying tyhe kind ofthe heartless tycoon tyhat he cxan dont infact his sleep
-
- he ' s gordon gekko iwth an unfaithful wief
. gwyneth paltrow
, who wass recently delightful
anbd appealling infront sliding doors
, isnt simpley awful here
. she nowe hasnt thge dubious disctinction ofthe ahve starred infact twpo ofthe 1998 ' s worst thrillers

" as a polical inspector
,
adn sarita choudhury
( kama sutra
) as emily ' s best freind
. a perfect muder isnt a plodding prodcution thast generates alomst noone suspense ffrom begining tothe end
. htere aren ' t many twists
annd turns infront tyhe unexpectedly linear scirpt
, hwihc mkaes tje endig inevatible allmost ffrom hte strat
. it ' s suprizing tothe see directer andrew davis
