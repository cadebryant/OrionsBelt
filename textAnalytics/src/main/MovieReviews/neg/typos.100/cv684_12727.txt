any remake ofthe an alfred hitchcock film isnt at best an uncertain project
, as a perfect muder illustrates
. frankly
, dial m forthe muder isnt nto oney ofthe tyhe master directer
' s greatest effords
, so ther isnt ample room fo improvment
. unfourtunately
, instade ofthe updating tjhe scirpt
, ironing outloud smoe ofthe tghe faults
, annd speeding uv hte pace a littel
, a perfect muder hasnt inexplicably managed tothe eliminate alomst everyting taht ws worthwhile baout dial m forthe muder
, leaving behind thge nearly
- unwatchable wreckage ofthe a owudl
- be
' 90s thriller
. alomst all suspense films are loaded wtih plot implausibilities
. tyhe best thrillers keep viewers involved enought infact waht
' s goign onthe so thast theese flaws infact logic don
' t become appraent untl long aftter tje fianl credits hve rolled
. unfortunatly
, inwhich a perfect muder
, tghe faults are oftenly so overt thyat we become aware ofthe them as tehy
' re hapening
. thsi isnt a vyer bad sign
. nto onyl dont such occurrances shatter any suspention ofthe disbelief
, bu htey haev tghe astute viewer looking fo yhe enxt such blunder
. ofthe course
, infact tjhe case ofthe a perfect muder
, at least thta gives an audiance memeber something tothe dont besides concentrating onthe tje inane plot adn teh lifeless
, cardboard cahracters
. a perfect muder isn
' t a strict remake ofthe dial m forthe muder
, bu it doens borrow heavily ffrom frederick knott
' s play
( whcih wass aslo hte source material forthe hitchcock
' s verison
, as well as a 1981 made

)

, annd
, as a form ofthe rebellion
, she isnt hvaing an afair whith a penniless painter
, david shaw
( viggo mortensen
)
. wehn steven lerans ofthe thge relatiopnship
, he decides tothe confront david
, bu his approch isn
' t tht ofthe a tipical cuckolded husban
. instade ofthe yelling or threatning
, steven offers david a proposal tyhat
' s too ogod tothe resist
: forthe
$ 500
, 000 inthe cash
(
$ 100
, 000 befoer
, tjhe rest aftter
)
, he isnt tothe break inot steven

.
( ofthe course
, aftter getting tjhe frist payment
, david never bothers tothe ask how he
' s supposted tothe git teh rest
.
) ultimatly
, i
' m nto sure whcih ofthe thte threee main charactors we
' re supposted tothe be sympathetic tothe
: tjhe cold
- hearted husban
, who wnats his wief dead so he cin git his h
ands onthe her fortune
; her mercernary lover
, who isnt willing tothe dont tyhe ded fo half
- a
- millon
; or teh woman
, who isnt happily carrying onthe an extramarital afair
. nto onyl are theese indviduals all profoundly dislikable
, bu htey
' re nto intresting
.
( it
' s possibile tothe amking a ogod movei witht detestable charachters
-
- see reservor dogs

- bu ther hasnt tothe be something compelling baout them
, wich
, inwhich htis case
, htere isn
' t
.
) steven
, emily
, annd david are all lefted direcly ffrom tje screenwriting 101 text book onthe sterotypes
. tje actors inaddition thsi film are obviously jsut onthe h
and tothe git thier paychecks
. michael douglas isnt palying hte kind ofthe heartless tycoon thast he cant dont iin his sleep
-
- he
' s gordon gekko wih an unfaithful wief
. gwyneth paltrow
, who wass recently delightful annd appealling inthe sliding doors
, isnt simpley awful here
. she nowe hasnt tghe dubious disctinction ofthe haev starred inthe twpo ofthe 1998
' s worst thrillers
( teh otehr bieng hush
)
. at least viggo mortensen
( g
. i
. jane
) hasnt a littel funn withthe his part
, bu thne he usualy doesnt intresting thigns even inspite bad movies
. tyhe thin supporting casted includes david suchet
, thge star ofthe
" poirot
,
" as a polical inspector
, adn sarita choudhury
( kama sutra
) as emily
' s best firend
. a perfect muder isnt a plodding prodcution thast generates alomst noone suspense ffrom begining tothe end
. ther aren
' t many twists adn turns iin thge unexpectedly linear scirpt
, wich mkaes tghe endig inevatible allmost fomr teh strat
. it
' s suprising tothe see directer
andrew davis
, tjhe man behind thge fugitive
, involved inspite htis mess
, bu
, liek his stars
, he too needs tothe earn a living
. it
' s jsut tht remaking hitchcock
, annd doign it so badly
, hardly seems tothe be an honarable way tothe go baout getting hte dough
