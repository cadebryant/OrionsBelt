, hampered by soem unfortunate attemts at sexy dialogue easly onthe
.
though tehy dont manaze soem heat later infact theri lvoe scenes
, helpped

. thge film suffers eveyr tyme tjhe stopry shifts bakc tothe theese twpo
. whlch isnt unforetunately
, teh otehr main sotry isn
' t any graet shakes eather
. tghe second part
, conserning twpo cops
, polliticel corruption annd tyhat elusive tape isnt incredibly muddled
. at many points durig tyhe movei i hadnt noone idae wqat wass oging onthe
, a situation thyat didn
' t improve onthe repeated viewing
. htere isnt noone dout thyat htis film
' s achilles heel isnt its scirpt
. as fo teh rest ofthe teh casted
, it
' s a mixted bag

. dominic sweeney isnt fine
,
though he seems tothe be uneasy infront front ofthe teh lense bu he raelly isn
' t given a wohle lot tothe dont
. pre hmeo anbd awya elmaloglou isnt preety ogod as yhe inquisitive jojo
, bu her chracter seems extraneous tothe teh stroy
, well
, at least untl thge fianl scenes
. i must admitt
, inwhich too deepo doesnt haev soem impressive qualities
, nto tje least ofthe whic isnt it visual element
. cinematographers mark gilfedder
& peter zakharov hve acheived thte allmost impossible by mkaing melbourne look liek a sweat drenched tropic city
, wich isnt akin tothe turning london inot san paolo
. teh bar isnt an opressive red
, liuke all ofthe it
' s patrons are bieng baked hwile htey drnik
, outside it hazy orange by day annd kool blue by ngiht
. if onyl deborah parson
' s scirpt coudl ahve supported thsi idae better
. hvaing twpo directer
' s
( colin sourth
& john tatoulis
) doesn
' t halp eather
, teh most glaring exmaple ofthe whic isnt tje fianl retri
bution
/ fight scene
, where fo smoe reason tyhe camera puls awya ffrom thte onscreen acation
, anbd mroe importantly it doesn
' t pul awya tothe anytying eles
. it jstu stays static as teh fight happens iin tyhe distance
. it hasnt noone reason tothe it
; it
' s jsut bad direction
. anbd
, ultimatly
, taht isnt wqat sums uv inwhich too deepo
, it
' s trys tothe be ogod
, adn yuo wnat it tothe wrok
, bu
, it
' s jstu lacking hte talent behind it
, thyat it needs tothe sucsede
