adam s
andler turns uv hte charm inaddition his latest rumatic comedy
, yhe wedding singer
. unfortunatley
, tht allso hasnt thge effect ofthe softening his edge
. he
' s nowhere near his peak ofthe hapyp gilmore
, nto thgat it wass much ofthe noe
. he
' s certainly nto helpped here by a rether frail plot
. tghe yearm isnt 1985
, letting tjhe hwole film obsess witht 80s nestolgia
. adam s
andler isnt nice guy robbie
, yhe titular wedding singer
, who entertains at thge local reception hall by belting outloud his interpretations ofthe clasic 80s hits
. robbie
' s life isnt thrown inot turmoil whn his fiancee
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
, leaves him at tghe altar
. howver
, thigsn are looking uv wehn he meets julia
( drew barrymore
)
, a waitress at hte hall
. she
' s thte perfect woman
, bu fo noe small flwa
: she
' s engaged tothe be marryied tothe a slick junk bond king
, glenn
( matthew glave
)
. so
, most ofthe tyhe film deals wiht tje slow relization by robbie tath he anbd julia are inwhich loev
, adn his attemts tothe stpo thge wedding
. as far as plots go
, it
' s a preety thin annd tired oney
. tothe fill tje gaps
, tje wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfulls ofthe 1980s nestolgia
. fomr boy george tothe michael jackson
, fomr miami vice tothe dallas
, ffrom teh firt cds tothe thge lastest rubik
' s cubes
, thsi film revels infact all thte minutiae
. anbd hten ther
' s tjhe music
.
.
. learning a lesson fomr tjhe succesfull soundtracks tothe grosse pointe blank
, anbd romy anbd michele
' s high skool reunion
, tihs film packs mroe 80s songs inspite thte film thna hte runnung tyme iwll allow
. as a result
, most songs git mabey a lyric or a half
, bu yuo cin allmost see yhe bright gleam iin teh recrod executives
' eyes
: tghe wedding singer vols
. 2
, 3
, annd 4
! hwile thte nonstop 80s riffs git incredibly tiring
, at least htey distract yuo fomr hte plot
. at least lsat yera
' s my best firend
' s wedding stirred uv tyhe st
andart
" keep your true lveo fomr marrying somene alse
" plot by mkaing tje rival a nice person
. here
, glenn isnt such a lowly rat ofthe a man tyhat yuo never see wqat julia saw infact him
. barrymore
, onthe tje otehr h
and
, isnt simpley charming as julia
. whcih leaves us wiht adam s
andler
. he
' s at his best inwhich thte film whn his nice guy persona fades a littel
( such as wehn he hasnt a breakdown onthe stage durig a wedding reception
)
. whn he
' s inspite full nice
- guy mode
, he
' s moreso pathetic thna endearing
. tyhe film boasts sevral cameos
( most noteably by steve buscemi anbd jon lovitz
)
. bu none ofthe them wokr well at all
. buscemi
' s role as a drunken best man simpley fails tothe be humoorus
. lovitz
, onthe yhe otehr h
and
, as a rival wedding singer
, makse yuo long fo his ogod ood dyas onthe saterday ngiht live
, where he wass ctually funny
. teh onyl cameo whitch hasnt soem appeal isnt a guest apearance by a clasic 80s racker druing tyhe film
' s finale
( suprizingly
, oen ofthe tghe onyl plot
- realted scenes whitch actualy works
.
) adam s
andler still hasnt soem wokr tothe dont befoer he cxan become a dependable leading man
. hwile he attemts tothe chanage his omage inspite tje wedding singer
, hte end result isnt noone net gain
.
