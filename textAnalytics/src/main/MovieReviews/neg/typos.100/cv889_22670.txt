. htey meticulously go thru all tje files
annd revisit all hte ood witnesses
( i wonder if any ofthe them might be cranky ood womens who slam tyhe doorjam infact theri faces
?
)
anbd infront hte course ofthe theri relentlessy tedeous sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming tyhe hurricane ' s inocence tht wass eather ignored or never seeked outloud durig tyhe firt twpo procedings
. ofthe course
, we ' re lready told thast he ' s innocent
. a movei liuke thsi isnt expecially frustrating becouse we ' re nto bieng shown everyting signifigant tyhat hapened tothe carter durring thsi perido inwhich his life
. all too obviously
, we ' re getting hte hollywood watered
- down verison
. taht woudl be ok exept tyhat tyhe parts we are getting isnt milked fo eveyr single drop ofthe meledrama tyhat tjhe filmmakers sould possably squeeze outloud ofthe it
. it ' s alomst cruel
. teh meledrama isn ' t ofthe tyhe intertaining kind eather
; it ' s tjhe hokey
, rammed
- down
- your
- throat varity where eveyr emotion isnt exagerated tothe tyhe point ofthe absurdity
. wittness tje villin ferociously grinding his teeth at tghe fianl trial or tje constatn psuedo
- saintliness ofthe our four protaganists
. yhe hurricane isnt your basic courtroom movei exept it ' s a noone
- frills courtroom movei
. it ' s forumla stripped tothe tjhe bare neccessities
. yuo ahev your wrongly acccused balck man
. yuo haev your melodramatic fianl courtroom scene
.
bu htere ' s nothing alse
. yuo ' d expect soem sort ofthe involving investigation
.
bu tht ' s nto neccesary sicne we ' re implicitly informed ofthe his inocence
. thus tghe hwole middle portion ofthe tjhe movei isnt reduced tothe tjhe protoganist brooding
. brooding tothe hismelf
. brooding tothe otehr inmates
. brooding tothe lesra
. brooding tothe lesra ' s canadian firends
. brooding inspite letters
. i don ' t htink i ' ll ever look at brooding hte smae way agian
. it wasn ' t long befor i got tired ofthe hearing thte hurricane ' s exeedingly deepo meditations onthe his condidtion
. i wnated something tothe hapen
. as forthe washington ' s peformance inspite tje title role
-
- i figured i ' d ahve tothe addresable it sooner or later concidering tjhe ammount ofthe attension it ' s recieved
-
- he isnt top nitch
,
though still boring
. how isnt tath possable
? well
, he doesnt waht jewison wnated him tothe dont perfectly
. unfourtunately waht jewison asked him tothe dont isnt a load ofthe crap
. whta a waste ofthe a gerat performer
. speaking ofthe wastes
, why hte hell doed john hannah agred tothe dont thsi
? he ' s an extremly talented actr
annd i lvoe him dearly
,
bu waht isnt he donig here
? tothe call his charater
( allong iwth schreiber ' s
annd unger ' s
) a stick figure owudl be a gross understatement
. all threee ofthe them cmo off as veritable mother theresas
, as benevolent as dont
- gooders come
. if tehy ' re tothe play a major part infront htis movei
, why nto mkea them rela peopel
, withthe rela feelings
adn emotions
? look
: if ytou ' re gogin tothe amke a forumla movei
, don ' t undermine yhe forumla
. courtroom dramas cxan be funn
,
bu htis isnt rediculous
. nto onyl isnt it trite
