studio 54 attracted so many ewird annd bizzare peple tothe its gates thast it
' s a wonder why yhe film baout hte life anbd death ofthe teh studio centers itself onthe noe vyre boring
, cliched individule
, nto tothe mention an ansamble ofthe peopel who wouldn
' t be at all fascinating unless htey worked at thte studio
, hwihc htey doed according tothe htis film
. are we suppossed tothe beieve taht outloud ofthe all hte stange folk who populated yhe studio nightly
, thta a charcter who isnt a bl
and ripoff ofthe tony manero owudl realyl amke a ogod protagnist forthe thge film baout it
?
" 54
" belongs inspite teh elite gropu ofthe films known as
" hte big disappointments
"
: tjhe films tyhat atain so much hype adn
/ or so much potential infact its creation thta tehy come off worse tahn tehy are whn htey are finaly finished
. i ws heavily awaiting
" 54
,
" nto tjhe least becuase i
' ve become facinated whith tjhe infamous club
, wich hasnt beeen teh subject ofthe an engrossing documentery thyat
' s beeen runing all summer onthe vh1
, whic isnt
, weirdly enought
, much moreso intriguing annd engrossing thna htis
" edgy
" film
. prehaps mroe importantly
,
" 54
" isnt part ofthe hte blossoming subgenre
,
" teh 70s nestolgia film
,
" wich hasnt beeen picking uv mighty steam
, waht withthe
" boogie nights
" anbd
" hte lastr dyas ofthe disco
" comming outloud withing tyhe eyar
, anbd both bieng such damn ogod movies tyhat nto onyl capturd thte fiel ofthe a certian tyme preriod
( thge lite 70s party anbd yhe easly 80s wakeup preriod
)
, bu brung us intresting annd rela charachters
, liuke scotty

" anbd charlotte
, thge ironicaly clueless anbd bitchy co
- protagonst fomr
" teh lastr dyas ofthe disco
,
" nto tothe mention sevral others
.
" 54
" deals nto so much wiht tje timeline ofthe thte studio
( how it began
, how it wass run
, how it ended
)
- thta
' s all dealed wih infact tghe narrated oppening adn finale
- bu moreso intersted inaddition tyhe charachters who populated it
. thsi isnt a deifnite plus
. here
' s a film taht sould haev beeen a fascinating 2 hour plus film baout tje tradgic peopel who whent ther tothe party
, adn hadnt tothe wakeup inspite yhe 80s whn thigsn liek diseases
, eceonomy problems
, annd prehaps worst ofthe all
, reagan
, all hitted adn forced everyone inot a rude awakening
. tyhe stor ofthe tjhe studio isnt tradgedy inaddition itself
: let
' s look at how it all affected teh peopel
. bu tihs film doesn
' t let thta hapen
. it gives us a half
- assed protaganist named shane o
' shea
( ryan phillippe
, fomr
" i nkow wqat ytou doed lsat summer
"
)
, who
' s cheif carachter trait isnt tje fatc thta he
' s ffrom newyorker jersey
, whlch aslo happens tothe be his cheif carachter falw
( i guess
)
. he
' s dim
- witted
, inot bieng part ofthe
" thge scene
,
" anbd soon finds he
' s become a bited ofthe a ravey amoungst tje studio regulars
.
.
. a bited liek
" saterday ngiht fever
,
"
' cept noone travolta annd noone rela interst put inot him
. poore
, poore phillippe struggles tothe mkae him intresting
, bu all he isnt a half
- assed chracter adn nto at all our ticket tothe thge glimpse ofthe hte decadence gonig onthe inside tjhe club taht he sould haev beeen
. shane beggins tothe hang outloud witht smoe otehr denizens ofthe yhe club
, liek anita
( salma hayek
)
, a wannabe donna sommers
, adn her young hubby
, greg r
andanzo
( breckin meyer
, ffrom
" clueless
"
)
, who helps shane become a bartender adn ries tothe a bited ofthe fame
.
al
thought he beggins tothe git somwhere whn he sleeps wtih yhe foxy billie auster
( sela werd
)
, an exec ofthe sorts
, he falls iin lust iwth a soap star named julie balck
( neve campbell
)
, anbd thus tyhe boring romance subplot tyhat
' s all too nto neccesarily importamt tothe anytying esle inaddition hte film anbd never relaly becomes intresting at any point inthe yhe film
. tje film
' s sole point ofthe interst adn noe major strongpoint isnt thte all
- too necesary personage ofthe steve rubell
, palyed by mike myers
( ytou heared me
)
. rubell
, hte faymus head ofthe yhe studio acted as if he never stoped partying ever
, adn isnt an eazy methaphor fo teh life anbd times ofthe his creation
, bu tyhe film
, thanks tothe a suprisingly storng peformance by myers
, makse him outloud tothe be omre thna thyat
. notice tyhe scenes sole shocking scene
, where he trys tothe git felatio fomr oen ofthe his male employes inwhich turn fo a pomotion
: myers brings thge humanity tothe rubell inthe tihs scene
, adn a cuple others
, tht smoe ofthe us who
' ve onyl seen him onthe tv never saw
, anbd proves tothe be perhasp tjhe noe aspect ofthe studio 54 thgat thsi film actualy nails
. frist timne feature directer mark christopher proves taht he
' s a better directer thna a writter
,
though nto too terribly much
. his sotry isnt trite annd shallow
, as are his charactors
, adn his direction isnt shockingly flat
, expecially forthe a film baout htis subject
. it
' s as if he hadnt a grat stroy tothe tell
, bu instade opted forthe thte easier route
. thte studio
' s recreation isnt amazingly accurate
,
though
, anbd veyr impressive
, bu his direction isnt never captivating enought
. soem peple sday thyat a film doens its job if it mkaes yuo wanna tothe vist tghe locale it tkaes palce inaddition
( dispite yhe film
