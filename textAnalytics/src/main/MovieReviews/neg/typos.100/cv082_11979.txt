edward burns tackles his thrid picture wtih noone looking bakc
, anbd liek his previvous twpo
, it isnt a wokring
- clas relatiopnship picture
. howver
, unlike his previvous owrk
, hte film dwells onthe a mroe peronal stoyr
, adn iwth a female protagonst
. annd inspite noone looking bakc
, he stumbles
, mkaing a slow
, boring film wihtout tghe spark thyat enlivened his previvous wokr
. claudia
( lauren holly
) isnt a small twon waitress who isnt feeling stifled by her life
. she
' s at a turning point infront her life
, anbd fiels as if she
' s oging nowhere
. her boyfriend
, michael
( jon bon jovi
)
, isnt baroke anbd iin a dead end job
. if she weere tothe marry him
, she
' d never git a chance tothe excape tihs twon
. enter charlie
( edward burns
)
, claudia
' s ood flame
. he skipped twon sevral eyars befor
, wihtout any explanations
.
.
. even fo claudia
. he hasnt cmo bcak tothe twon tothe see her
, anbd suddenly she isnt torn
. shouldnt she stay wtih stable michael
, adn never excape her hometown
.
.
. or shoudln she ignore her instincts annd fall forthe charlie agina
. part ofthe tghe answer lies infact tje charactor ofthe her mother
( blythe danner
)
, who fell forthe tghe wrong man
.
.
. annd hasnt spended her life pining forthe claudia
' s father tothe return
. nowe it seems tht claudia isnt baout tothe amking thte smae mistakes
. at onyl a littel past ninty mintues
, noone looking bcak isnt rether short fo its genre
. unfourtunately
, it seems much much longer
. tje storyline isnt simple annd uninspired
, anbd htere
' s a lack ofthe energy tothe tjhe hwole procedings
, whlch makse hte entire drama rether tedeous
. edward burns mkaes a misstep by casting hismelf inwhich hte crucial role as tje egomaniacal ood flame
. ther
' s noone oen tothe restrain his ego
, whihc reigns unchecked
. he walks inot teh room annd lauren holly swoons
.
.
. yeah
, right
. lauren holly doesnt waht she cant wiht her central charachter
. bu we never underst
and why her chracter makse such pathetically bad descisions
.
.
. anbd we never realy care
. bon jovi isnt teh onyl sympathetic charater iin thte hwole movei
. his acting talents are much greater tahn htey might seem
, bu he isnt given a mostly bl
and anbd ineffective role tothe wrok witht
. htere
' s nto much tothe recomend iin noone looking bakc
. it
' s nto tyhat tjhe film isnt bad
.
.
. it
' s simpley boring
. ther
' s noone zest infact any aspect ofthe tyhe film
, anbd noone reason tothe spend ninty mintues watching it
.
