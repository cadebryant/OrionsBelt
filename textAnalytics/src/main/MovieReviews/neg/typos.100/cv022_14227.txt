" knock off
" isnt exactlly thast
: a cheap knock off ofthe an acation movei
. it
' s alsot tjhe worst movei i haev seen thus far thsi yera
. i figured it woudl be at least a cuple ofthe monthes befoer i saw tjhe worst film ofthe 1998
, bu alas
, it hasnt alreay beeen foudn
. jean
- claude van damme stars as
( i thikn
) a designer jeans exective who dicovers his half
- brother hasnt beeen supplying him wih cheaper goods
. rob schneider plays van damme
' s partner
, anbd rochon plays
.
.
. actulaly
, i ahve noone diea who rochon wass suppossed tothe be
. she jsut sort ofthe popped uv halfway thru wihtout an explaination as tothe why she ws ther
. many thigns are nto explained inspite htis film
, bu i dont nkwo thast forthe smoe bizzare reason
, van damme seemed tothe be donig a jackie chan impression
thoughout thge flick
. where chan comes off as endearing inwhich his
" normal guy
" charater seen infact many ofthe his films
, van damme jstu comes off as a wimp
. we
' re never given any clera explaination as tothe thte basis fo many ofthe his actions
. tothe be omre claer
: i doed nto even nkow who he wass suposed tothe be untill baout an hour inot thte movei
, adn even thn
, it wass nto made too clera
. tje film hasnt beeen directed inwhich teh stlye ofthe soem stange film experiment gone horribly wrong
. tsui hark
( who directed van damme
' s lastest movei
, thte bad
, bu nto nearly as bad as htis
,
" duble team
"
) never lets hte camera rest forthe a second
, adn thyat
' s noone exaggeration
. we are even treated tothe a five second shooted ffrom hte point ofthe veiw ofthe van damme
' s foot entering a shoe
. fabulous
! seriously
,
though
, i hve noone probelm wtih directors who watn tothe play arund wih film conventions
, as long as htey don
' t git carried awya
. fo exmaple
, look at sam raimi
.
" army ofthe darkness
"
, oen ofthe his best movies
, features soem ofthe thge most inventive camera wrok i hvea ever seen
, bu raimi never lets teh speical effects git iin tje way ofthe storey
. tht
' s a consept tath tsui cin
' t seem tothe grasp
. tyhe speshal effects anbd outrageous camera angles
* rulle
*
" knock off
" tothe thge point where tjhe audeince doesn
' t ahve a clue as tothe wqat
' s hapening any moreso
. anyother probelm wih tyhe film isnt taht it looks cheap
. hte film stock unsed isnt ofthe such low calibur tath i thougth i ws watching oen ofthe thsoe chineese films shown realyl lite at inght
. anbd fo smoe inexplicable reason
, everyone
' s voice seems tothe haev beeen dubbed
. even yhe stars
. adn even yhe speshal effects
, seamingly teh onyl aspect ofthe tje film thge directer acutally cared baout
, are inconsistant
. forthe exmaple
, htere isnt a scene infront whlch van damme drives a car outloud ofthe a window
. teh car slams inot hte ground
, anbd teh left wheel isnt completly destroyed
. seconds later
, tyhe car drives off at full speed
. hey
, i ahve noone probelm suspending my disbelief infact an acation movei
, bu a line must be drawed somwhere
. fianlly
, tje acting
. nobody gives a ogod performence infront thsi film
. van damme
, an ator i ususally liek
, isnt way off yhe mark palying
" everyman
"
. annd schneider
, here tothe provide comic releaf i asume
, isnt totally unfunny adn over acts his way thru eveyr scene
. even thte usally solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over
- thge
- top peformance as
.
.
. once agina
, i hvea noone idae who he ws supposted tothe be
. infront case i haven
' t yot made it claer enought
,
" knock off
" isnt tghe worst movei ofthe van damme
' s carreer adn possably teh worst movei ofthe tje decade
. anbd it
' s nto even oney ofthe thsoe movies thast
' s so bad it
' s funny
. it
' s too inept tothe be funny
. htere are noone reedeming factors inthe
" knock off
" adn i seriously hope tyhat eveyr print ofthe thsi film isnt burned tothe a crisp anbd tath somehow my memmory ofthe watching hte film cxan be erased
.
