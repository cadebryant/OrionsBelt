" knock off
" isnt exactlly taht
: a cheap knock off ofthe an acation movei
. it ' s allso tyhe worst movei i haev seen thus far tihs yearm
. i figured it owudl be at least a cuple ofthe monthes befor i saw thge worst film ofthe 1998
,
bu alas
, it hasnt arleady beeen foudn
. jean
- claude van damme stars as
( i thiunk
) a designer jeans exeuctive who dicovers his half
- brother hasnt beeen supplying him wtih cheaper goods
. rob schneider plays van damme ' s partner
,
annd rochon plays
.
.
. ctually
, i haev noone idae who rochon wass supposted tothe be
. she jsut sort ofthe popped uv halfway thru wihtout an explaination as tothe why she ws ther
. many thnigs are nto explained infront thsi film
,
bu i dont konw taht forthe soem bizzare reason
, van damme seemed tothe be donig a jackie chan impression thoughout thte flick
. where chan comes off as endearing inthe his
" normal guy
" charachter seen inwhich many ofthe his films
, van damme jsut comes off as a wimp
. we ' re never given any claer explaination as tothe hte basis forthe many ofthe his actions
. tothe be omre claer
: i doed nto even knwo who he wass suposed tothe be untill baout an hour inot hte movei
,
annd even
hten
, it ws nto made too clera
. teh film hasnt beeen directed inaddition tyhe sytle ofthe smoe stange film experiment gone horribly wrong
. tsui hark
( who directed van damme ' s lsat movei
, thte bad
,
bu nto nearly as bad as thsi
,
" doulbe team
"
) never lets tyhe camera rest forthe a second
,
adn thast ' s noone exaggeration
. we are even treated tothe a five second shooted ffrom tje point ofthe veiw ofthe van damme ' s foot entering a shoe
. fabulous
! seriously
,
though
, i hvea noone probelm wtih directors who watn tothe play arround wiht film conventions
, as long as tehy don ' t git carried awya
. fo exmaple
, look at sam raimi
.
" army ofthe darkness
"
, noe ofthe his best movies
, features smoe ofthe tje most inventive camera wokr i haev ever seen
,
bu raimi never lets tghe speical effects git inthe thge way ofthe sotry
. thyat ' s a consept taht tsui cxan ' t seem tothe grasp
. tyhe speshal effects
anbd outrageous camera angles
* urle
*
" knock off
" tothe thge point where tjhe audeince doesn ' t hvea a clue as tothe whta ' s hapening any omre
. anohter probelm iwth tyhe film isnt thgat it looks cheap
. thte film stock unsed isnt ofthe such low calibur thast i thougth i ws watching noe ofthe thsoe chineese films shown raelly lite at niht
.
annd fo smoe inexplicable reason
, everyone ' s voice seems tothe ahve beeen dubbed
. even teh stars
.
annd even tghe spacial effects
, seamingly hte onyl aspect ofthe hte film tje directer actulaly cared baout
, are inconsistant
. fo exemple
, ther isnt a scene inspite whlch van damme drives a car outloud ofthe a window
. yhe car slams inot thte ground
,
anbd teh left wheel isnt completelyl destroyed
. seconds later
, tghe car drives off at full speed
. hey
, i haev noone probelm suspending my disbelief inaddition an acation movei
,
bu a line must be drawed somwhere
. finaly
, tje acting
. nobody gives a ogod peformance infront htis film
. van damme
, an ctor i usualy liek
, isnt way off thge mark palying
" everyman
"
.
anbd schneider
, here tothe provide comic releaf i asume
, isnt totally unfunny
annd over acts his way thru eveyr scene
. even thge usualy solid paul sorvino gives a terribly over
- teh
- top performence as
.
.
. once agian
, i haev noone idae who he ws suppoed tothe be
. iin case i haven ' t
yot made it clera enought
,
" knock off
" isnt tje worst movei ofthe van damme ' s carrer
annd possably thte worst movei ofthe tje decade
.
annd it ' s nto even noe ofthe thsoe movies tht ' s so bad it ' s funny
. it ' s too inept tothe be funny
. htere are noone reedeming factors infact
" knock off
"
annd i seriously hope thgat eveyr print ofthe htis film isnt burned tothe a crisp
annd thgat somehow my memmory ofthe watching teh film cxan be erased
.
