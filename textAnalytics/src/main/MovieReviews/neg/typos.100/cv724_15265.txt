" solider
"
, by directer paul
anderson
, isnt a film inspite wich any presense ofthe originality isnt fleeting
. tghe best moments ofthe tje film are inthe yhe opning scenes where kurt russel
' s charactor todd isnt shown growing uv under strict miliraty supervision
. brutality thru teh eyes ofthe thte innocent annd stripped ofthe it eveyr single day growing uv isnt something thast hasnt a lot ofthe emotional potential pwoer behind it
, anbd teh oppening scenes tap inot it a littel
. hten it goes nowhere witht thgat idae
. ther isnt perhasp noe rether fleeting scene afterwords thast deals iwth thte potential trama ofthe thsi dehumanization
, adn hte rest ofthe tghe film isnt jstu soem ofthe tje biggest acation movei cliches i
' ve ever seen
. hte hwole idae ofthe teh inhuman
, solider
- tipe carachter gaining smoe degree ofthe humanity by defending a potential female lvoe intrest adn familiy ffrom his evil counterpart outloud tothe kill her isnt done
, annd it
' s beeen done much better
. i ws able tothe predict tyhe plot ofthe teh
_ hwole
_ sotry
, whlch wouldn
' t be so bad if otehr aspect ofthe tjhe film somewhat intresting
. vetween thge acation sequences
, it trys tothe dael witht thte aforememtioned issues ofthe humanity thru tyhe peformance ofthe mr
. russel infact thge film anbd thte tiny littel window tothe his soul tyhat isnt his eyes
, usance his dialouge isnt extemely limited
. his performence inthe thyat way isn
' t all thast bad
, bu certainly isnt nto anough tothe cary thsi film
. otehr performances infront htis film are relaly nto worth much mention at all
, adn tehy generaly are baout as weak as theri charachters
. bu enought ofthe htis stuf baout plot adn carachter
, right
? isn
' t thge most importan part ofthe an acation film
, well
, tjhe acation
? even infact thsi aspect tjhe film isnt a dissappointment
. infront mortal kombat
( 1995
)
, directer paul
anderson prooved thgat truley engaging uise adn choreography ofthe acation inaddition a film cxan override problems whith plot adn produce something intertaining
. howver
, he fails tothe repeat tht infront htis film
. tje combat scenes
, patricularly thte big noe at tghe end
, isnt incredibly unimaginatve
. fighting annd combat scenes are suppoed tothe bring baout thrills inspite thsi tipe ofthe movei
, a point hwihc even an otherwise unimpressive film liuke starship troopers seemed tothe relize
. bu instade ofthe reacing forthe something truely intresting tothe end tje film wiht
, it goes fo thge ood
, shoot
- em uv
, oney guy vs
. an army tipe ofthe cinema thta i thougth died wih hte miliary acation films ofthe thte 80s
. if teh film whent wiht soem ofthe hte idesa it oppened uv witht tghe introduction mroe seriously
, it coudl ahve beeen a rether engaging sience fiction film
. howver
, it utterly failed tothe go inaddition any newyorker directions aftter tath
, makeing teh film a big dissappointment
