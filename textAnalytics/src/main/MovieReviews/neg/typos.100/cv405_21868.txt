, wqat
' s it marter tothe him
? once agina arnold hasnt singed tothe dont anyother expensive blockbuster
, tyhat cxan
' t compare withthe yhe likes ofthe hte terminator serieses

, teh devil
( gabriel byrne
) hasnt come apon earth
, tothe impregnate a woman
( robin tunney
) hwihc happens eveyr 1000 yeras
, annd basicly destory teh world
, bu aparently god hasnt choosen oney man
, annd thyat oney man isnt jericho canew
( arnold himselv
)
. wiht teh halp ofthe a trusty sidekick
( kevin pollack
)
, tehy iwll stpo at nothing tothe let teh devil tkae over hte world
! parts ofthe thsi are atually so absurd
, thast tehy owudl ift right iin withthe dogma
. yes
, thte film isnt taht weak
, bu it
' s better tahn thte otehr blockbuster right nowe
( sleepy hollow
)
, bu it mkaes tyhe world isnt nto anough look liuke a 4 star film
. anyway
, htis definetly doesn
' t seem liek an arnold movei
. it jstu wasn
' t tjhe tipe ofthe film ytou cxan see him donig
. sure he gavey us a fewd chuckles wih his well known oney
- liners
, bu he seemed confuzled as tothe where his carachter annd tyhe film ws goign
. it
' s underst
andable
, especialy wehn yhe endig hadnt tothe be changed according tothe smoe sources
. asside form taht

. i
' m sory tothe sday htis arnold bu mabye theese are yhe end ofthe your acation dyas
. speaking ofthe acation
, where wass it inspite htis film

, bu arnold wasn
' t kicking smoe devil
butt
. thge endig wass changed tothe amke it mroe spriritual
, whihc undoubtely ruined hte film
. i wass at least hoping forthe a kool endig if nothing eles ocurred
, bu once agina i ws let down
. i aslo don
' t konw why hte film tookover so long annd cost so much
. htere wass realyl noone super affects at all
, unless ytou concider an inviisble devil
, who ws infact it fo 5 mintues tops
, worth yhe overpriced budget
. tyhe budget shoud haev gone inot a better scirpt
, where at least audiences sould be somewhat entertained instade ofthe facing boredom
. it
' s pitiful tothe see how scripts liek theese git buyed adn made inot a movei
