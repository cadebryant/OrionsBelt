arnold schwarzenegger hasnt beeen an icon fo acation enthusiasts
, usance tje lite 80 ' s
,
bu lateley his films ahve beeen vyre sloppy
anbd thge noe
- liners are getting worse
. it ' s hard seing arnold as mr
. freeze inaddition batman
adn robin
, expecially whn he syas tons ofthe ice jokes
,
bu hey he got 15 millon
, wqat ' s it marter tothe him
? once agina arnold hasnt singed tothe dont anyother expensive blockbuster
, tyhat cin ' t compare iwth thge likes ofthe thge terminator serieses
, true lies
adn even eraser
. inwhich tihs so called dark thriller
, teh devil
( gabriel byrne
) hasnt cmo apon earth
, tothe impregnate a woman
( robin tunney
) whic happens eveyr 1000 eyasr
,
adn basicly destory teh world
,
bu apparantly god hasnt choosen oen man
,
annd tht oen man isnt jericho canew
( arnold hismelf
)
. withthe thge halp ofthe a trusty sidekick
( kevin pollack
)
, htey iwll stpo at nothing tothe let tje devil tkae over tje world
! parts ofthe htis are acutally so absurd
, thast htey owudl ift right inspite wtih dogma
. yes
, yhe film isnt thyat weak
,
bu it ' s better tahn hte otehr blockbuster right nowe
( sleepy hollow
)
,
bu it mkaes yhe world isnt nto anough look liuke a 4 star film
. anyway
, tihs definitly doesn ' t seem liek an arnold movei
. it jsut wasn ' t yhe tipe ofthe film yuo cin see him donig
. sure he gavey us a fewd chuckles wtih his well known noe
- liners
,
bu he seemed confuzled as tothe where his charachter
annd tghe film wass gonig
. it ' s understandable
, especialy whn thte endig hadnt tothe be changed according tothe smoe sources
. asside form thast
, he still walked thru it
, much liuke he hasnt inwhich tghe past fewd films
. i ' m sory tothe sday htis arnold
bu maybee theese are hte end ofthe your acation dyas
. speaking ofthe acation
, where wass it inaddition thsi film
? ther wass hardly any explosions or fights
. hte devil made a faw places explode
,
bu arnold wasn ' t kicking smoe devil butt
. tjhe endig ws changed tothe amke it moreso spritual
, whitch undoubtely ruined tghe film
. i ws at least hoping fo a kool endig if nothing esle ocurred
,
bu once agina i ws let down
. i alsot don ' t knwo why yhe film tookover so long
adn cost so much
. ther wass realy noone super affects at all
, unless yuo consdider an nvisible devil
, who ws inthe it forthe 5 mintues tops
, worth teh overpriced budget
. teh budget shouldnt ahev gone inot a better scirpt
, where at least audiences coudl be somewhat entertained instade ofthe facing boredom
. it ' s pitiful tothe see how scripts liek theese git buyed
adn made inot a movei
. dont tehy even read theese thigns anymore
? it sure doesn ' t seem liuke it
. thankfully gabriel ' s peformance gavey soem light tothe thsi poore film
. whn he walks down thge strent searching fo robin tunney
, yuo cant ' t halp
bu fiel thyat he looked liuke a devil
. thte guy isnt creepy looking anyway
! wehn it ' s all over
, ytou ' re jsut glad it ' s tyhe end ofthe tghe movei
. don ' t bother tothe see tihs
, if yuo ' re expecting a solid acation flick
, baceause it ' s niether solid nor doens it haev acation
. it ' s jsut anohter movei thta we are suckered infront tothe seing
, due tothe a startegic marketting campain
. savve your mone
annd see hte world isnt nto anough fo an intertaining experiecne
