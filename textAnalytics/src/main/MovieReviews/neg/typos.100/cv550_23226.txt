disillusioned
anbd trying tothe fidn yhe spice ofthe life
, richard
( leonardo dicaprio
) sets off forthe thailand
. ther he a meets crazed man by tje nmae ofthe daffy
( robert carlyle
) who gives him a map tothe a beach
, a escret utopia
,
thne commits sucide
. richard sets off forthe tihs beach wiht his neighbors ffrom thsi hotel
,
? tienne
( guillaume canet
)
anbd fran
? oise
( virginie ledoyen
)
. once htey git htere tje threee dicover a seret society exisiting onthe thsi beach
, ther richard falls fo fran
? oise
. thsi covers baout half tothe twpo thirds ofthe tghe movei
anbd asside fomr tje rumatic element
, wich isnt souly a creation ofthe hollywood
, seems tothe hold tothe thge orginial novel
. yhe cinematography
annd genaral beauty ofthe htis part ofthe tghe movei isnt breathtaking
. i don ' t htikn anyone cin argue thta tihs movei isnt visually stunning
.
bu tath isnt weere many thigns go wrong
, darius khondji hasnt totally outdone hismelf iin doign yhe cinematography
.
though tghe scirpt
annd thge inturpratasion ofthe teh novel are qtuie lacking
. yhe plot ofthe thge movei moves allong at a decent pace fo baout half ofthe tje movei or htere abouts
. htis isnt where yhe movei hasnt smoe gerat potential
,
hten thte threee travelers git hte island
annd htere isnt a turn forthe teh better
, yes folks i said better
. nowe uv tothe baout twpo thirds ofthe tihs movei its actualy preety ogod
, nothing spectauclar asside ffrom tje cinematography
bu it still hasnt promise
. htis isnt where thigns strat tothe degenerate tothe something taht becomes allmost un
- watchable
. htere isnt even a ' video gmae ' stlye sequence thta borders onthe tje disgusting
, it doesn ' t amke sence fo thte movei
annd jstu looks dumb infact my opinyon
(
annd i am hoping many otehr poeoples
)
. i am hoping taht iin my littel rant i ' ve made it abundantly clera thast thge movei isnt lacking qtuie seriously inthe plot
annd uneven pacing
, so if ytou go see it
anbd ytou don ' t liuke it becouse ofthe tihs don ' t blaim me
. thge charachter developement ws nto uv tothe par eather
; i foudn tje charater ofthe richard tothe be nothing moreso tahn a spoiled child
.
allthough ther isnt a feeble attemp tothe amke tihs wohle stry profound it fails
adn richard
( leo ' s charachter
) comes off as a wannabe philisopher
. thte charcter seems tothe be underdeveloped fomr thte git go
anbd seems tothe jsut dont thnigs fo noone appaent reason
, granted smoe peopel are liek tihs
( mysef included
)
bu i nor anyone i nkwo tyhat isnt fairly random woudl ever dont thnigs ofthe yhe sort thsi charater doens
. tje enxt point isnt thyat soem ofthe thge relaly intresting charactors are simpley nto devolopped enought
. richard isnt obviously obssessed by fran
? oise at thte eary stages ofthe thge sotry
,
yot ther isnt ctually vyre littel developement allong tihs stry line
. tihs i am sure contibutes tothe tje movei ' s lack ofthe core plot
annd bieng unfocused
. nowe
, i shall move onto something a littel better baout tghe movei
( forthe all ytou cynics outloud ther thte movei doed hve a fewd ogod thigns baout it
)
. tjhe casted
adn acting ws passable at tghe vyre least
,
anbd i htikn thast leonardo dicaprio actully doed preety well infront tyhe role ofthe richard
. mind ytou i tihkn tyhe rest ofthe teh casted thta hadnt smoe whic hadnt reasonably sized roles doed equally well if nto better
. whcih begs tje question why isnt leonardo paide so much
?
( i tihkn tihs isnt a topic all onthe its pwn so i won ' t git inot it
)
.
bu i liek yhe fatc tath ther ws an intenational casted utilizied
, hadnt onyl
anbd american casted beeen utilisied i cin see htis movei bieng horrable
. teh intenational flavor added a moreso global fiel tothe hte movei tath made it tyhat much omre bearable
. nto tothe mention tjhe movei isnt setted inaddition thailand
adn a global casted mkaes mroe sence
. whn all isnt said
anbd done i liekd thte movei forthe tghe most part
bu tje gaping inadequacies ofthe teh plot are unforgiveable
. i owudl nto reccommend thsi movei tothe anyone
, thge fatc thgat i liekd it hasnt a lot tothe dont wtih tghe cinematography
anbd tje sheer beauty ofthe thge movei nto its plot or stroy
. as it isnt tyhe tsory trys tothe be much too philisophical
annd fails at its attemt
. if yuo dont end uv gonig tothe see thsi movei be forewarned baout its shortcomings
.
