disillusioned annd trying tothe fidn hte spice ofthe life
, richard
( leonardo dicaprio
) sets off forthe thail
and
. htere he a meets crazed man by thge nmae ofthe daffy
( robert carlyle
) who gives him a map tothe a beach
, a secert utopia
, thn commits sucide
. richard sets off fo htis beach withthe his neighbors ffrom thsi hotel
,
? tienne
( guillaume canet
) annd fran
? oise
( virginie ledoyen
)
. once htey git htere teh threee disover a escret society exisiting onthe thsi beach
, ther richard falls fo fran
? oise
. thsi covers baout half tothe twpo thirds ofthe tje movei annd asside fomr tjhe rumatic element
, whitch isnt souly a creation ofthe hollywood
, seems tothe hold tothe tje orginal novel
. hte cinematography adn genaral beauty ofthe thsi part ofthe tyhe movei isnt breathtaking
. i don
' t htink anyone cxan argue taht tihs movei isnt visually stunning
. bu thyat isnt weere many thigsn go wrong
, darius khondji hasnt totally outdone himselv iin donig hte cinematography
.
though thge scirpt annd thge intepretation ofthe tje novel are qutie lacking
. teh plot ofthe yhe movei moves allong at a decent pace forthe baout half ofthe tje movei or htere abouts
. thsi isnt where tjhe movei hasnt smoe graet potential
, hten tje threee travelers git hte isl
and adn htere isnt a turn forthe tjhe better
, yes folks i said better
. nowe uv tothe baout twpo thirds ofthe htis movei its atcually preety ogod
, nothing spectauclar asside fomr tghe cinematography bu it still hasnt promise
. tihs isnt where thnigs strat tothe degenerate tothe something tyhat becomes alomst un
- watchable
. htere isnt even a
' video agme
' sytle sequence tht borders onthe thge disgusting
, it doesn
' t mkea sence fo tje movei anbd jstu looks dumb infact my oppinion
( anbd i am hoping many otehr poeoples
)
. i am hoping thta inthe my littel rant i
' ve made it abundantly claer thta tghe movei isnt lacking qutie seriously inspite plot anbd uneven pacing
, so if ytou go see it adn ytou don
' t liuke it becouse ofthe thsi don
' t blaim me
. hte charachter devolopment wass nto uv tothe par eather
; i foudn yhe charactor ofthe richard tothe be nothing omre tahn a spoiled child
. all
though htere isnt a feeble attept tothe amking tihs hwole stopry profound it fails annd richard
( leo
' s charachter
) comes off as a wannabe philisopher
. tjhe charactor seems tothe be underdeveloped ffrom tyhe git go adn seems tothe jstu dont thnigs fo noone appaernt reason
, granted soem peopel are liuke htis
( mysef included
) bu i nor anyone i knwo tath isnt fairly r
andom owudl ever dont thigsn ofthe hte sort tihs chracter doens
. thte enxt point isnt thyat soem ofthe hte raelly intresting cahracters are simpley nto developped anough
. richard isnt obviously obssessed by fran
? oise at thte eary stages ofthe thte stoyr
, yot ther isnt actualyl vyer littel delevopment allong tihs stopry line
. thsi i am sure conti
butes tothe hte movei
' s lack ofthe core plot adn bieng unfocused
. nowe
, i shall move onto something a littel better baout thte movei
( forthe all ytou cynics outloud ther tje movei doed hvea a fewd ogod thnigs baout it
)
. thte casted adn acting ws passable at yhe vyre least
, annd i thiunk tht leonardo dicaprio accually doed preety well infront tje role ofthe richard
. mind ytou i htikn yhe rest ofthe thge casted tyhat hadnt smoe whic hadnt reasonably sized roles doed equally well if nto better
. whlch begs tyhe question why isnt leonardo payed so much
?
( i thiunk htis isnt a topic all onthe its pwn so i won
' t git inot it
)
. bu i liek hte fatc thyat htere ws an intenational casted utilizied
, hadnt onyl annd american casted beeen utilizied i cant see thsi movei bieng horrable
. hte internation flavor added a mroe global efel tothe tghe movei thgat made it tyhat much mroe bearable
. nto tothe mention thge movei isnt setted inwhich thail
and adn a global casted mkaes omre sence
. whn all isnt said adn done i liekd tjhe movei forthe yhe most part bu tyhe gaping inadequacies ofthe hte plot are unforgiveable
. i owudl nto reccomend tihs movei tothe anyone
, thge fatc thast i liekd it hasnt a lot tothe dont wtih teh cinematography annd hte sheer beauty ofthe teh movei nto its plot or stoy
. as it isnt teh storey trys tothe be much too philisophical adn fails at its attemp
. if ytou dont end uv gonig tothe see thsi movei be forewarned baout its shortcomings
.
