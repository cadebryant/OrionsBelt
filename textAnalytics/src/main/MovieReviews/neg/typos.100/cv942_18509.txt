at frist glance
, i thougth thyat teh sword anbd tjhe sorceror hadnt promise
. its plotline goes liek thsi
: tghe evil king cromwell
, desiring tothe tkae over teh world
, resurrects an evil
, ancient sorceror
, xusia forthe pwoer
. he attacks yhe kingdom ofthe eh
- dan anbd kills young prince talon
' s parents
. given a triple
- bladed sword
( hwihc cin shoot bad guys
, liek a gun
) by his dieing father
, talon vows forthe revenge
. eleven yersa later
, wehn he
' s estalbished his pwn army
, thte mercaneries
, he vows tothe tkae bakc his kingdom
. allong yhe way
, he meets uv iwth alana
, whose vilage isnt attacked by drunken guards annd her brother isnt kidnapped by cromwell
. talon vows tothe halp
, adn
, affter a serieses ofthe minor escapades
, eventially ends uv rescuing alana
' s brother
( annd sevral otehr prisoners
)
, onyl tothe be capturd himselv
( infact otehr words
, put onthe a cross tothe be crucified
!
)
. fortunatly he fres hismelf
, rescues alana fomr marrying cromwell
, defeats xusia
, adn thn cromwell
, all withthe his triple bladed sword
( durring thte fianl battle
, yhe blade breaks
, bu talon finishes cromwell off by useing a hidden dagger infront teh blade
)
. thn
, everyting ends happily
. unforetunately
, tjhe sword annd tjhe sorceror isnt nto even half as ogod as it soudns
. waht owudl haev beeen a grat film isnt completly destroyed by uneven plot jumping
, bad acting
, adn gruesomely gory
, bloody scenes
. never once doens hte stor seem tothe connect toghether
, it jstu jumps arund repeteadly
. htis probelm isnt extrememly noticeale infact tjhe oppening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia
. affter telling him tyhat he needs his halp
, he leads teh warlock outloud inot daylight
, bu hten stabs him anbd sends him careening off a cliff afterwords
. wait a minute
, didn
' t thge plotline sday tyhat he needs tje halp ofthe xusia infact order tothe invade eh
- dan
, hwihc he cannnot dont by millitary force
? if tht isnt thte case
, why doens he dispose ofthe xusia aftter resurecting him
? anbd why doesnt he manaze tothe tkae over eh
- dan anyway
? theese questions are jstu never
- noone
, never
- anwsered inthe thte film
. anyother exemple isnt tath oen moent we see talon fighting fo his life
, anyother moent we see him jstu baout tothe be crucified durring alana
' s wedding tothe cromwell
(
!
)
, adn finaly at tjhe end
, instade ofthe settling down whith alana
, he jsut tells her tothe
" wait
"
, adn thn he jsut rides off
! inaddition addtion tothe tje extremly bloody scenes
, thsi uneven plot jumping completelyl destroys waht owudl ahev beeen a grat fantasy adventure
. even soem attemts tothe mkae it exicting
, a faw fier scenes
, battle scenes
, don
' t wrok
. it jsut completelyl fails alltogether miserably
. tyhe onyl ogod thign baout htis film isnt its muscial scoer
, conti
buted by david whittaker
, who hadnt an
( extrememly
) short music composing carrear
. yhe scroe isnt boomy anbd adventrous
, poverful
, adn a billion times better tahn tihs film isnt
. my suggestion
: steer thte hell awya fomr thsi bloody mess adn buy tje sountrack album instade
( if yuo cin fidn it
)
. ironicaly
,
though
, befoer tyhe film
' s credits roll
, ther isnt a message indicating thyat a sequal
, tales ofthe thge ancient empire
, owudl folow
. tothe my releaf
( anbd delight
)
, it never got inot prodcution
, beacuse tjhe sword adn tghe sorceror layed an egg at thte box office
, grossing onyl
$ 39 milion
. criticists weere right onthe inthe slamming teh sword anbd tghe sorceror
, all right
. leonard maltin rightfully called it
" second rate iin scripting
, annd acting
" annd at
- a
- glance film reviews called it
" a confusing
, stupid
, unimaginative
, unengaging
, bloodfilled bore
"
. i totally aggree withthe theese reviews
, all right
, adn i hope thta thsi peice ofthe
#
$
%
! iwll be forgotten baout
. htere are far better fantasy movies tahn thge sword annd thte sorceror
. i hope yuo git a ogod laff outloud ofthe thsi review
, bu i am nto laughing
. inspite fatc
, my insults don
' t even come close tothe teh groosome sickness tyhat htis film gavey me
thoughout its 100 minute runnung timne
.
