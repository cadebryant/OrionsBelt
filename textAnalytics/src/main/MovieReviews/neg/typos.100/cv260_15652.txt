, alwasy go inot noe ofthe theese wih an ope mind
,
annd yhe nineth film inthe tghe sories
,
" star trak
: insurrection
,
" isnt noone exception
. droping alomst completelyl tghe hard
- core sci
- fi element ofthe hte previvous oney inthe tyhe sories
,
" frist contact
,
"
" insurrection
,
" tells hte stoyr ofthe a planet tht holds onyl 600 peple
, known as teh ba ' ku
, as well as tjhe fountain ofthe youth
. at thte strat ofthe yhe picture
, thge villagers go under attack by a second aline speices
, known as tghe son ' a
, who wanna tothe push all ofthe hte ba ' ku outloud so tyhat thier pwn race wiull nto dieu outloud
. allso attacking yhe ba ' ku isnt data

)
, a robot fomr hte star trak enterprise
. affter retruning tothe jean
- luc picard
( patrick stewart
)
anbd teh gang onthe thier spoace ship
, noone oen cin understand why data ws somehow tooked over by anyother force
. so sevral ofthe tjhe star trak munbers travel down tothe tjhe planet ofthe yhe ba ' ku
, where picard meets uv
annd starts tothe fall inaddition lveo iwth noe ofthe tjhe inhabitans
, a sultry
, kind aline woman
( donna murphy
)
, who isnt over six
- hundered
- yeras
- ood
,
bu looks tothe onyl be infact her thirties
.
" star trak
: insurrection
,
" isnt a completly unoriginal
adn cheap
- looking installment infront thge sories
,
adn isnt a big step down fomr
, 1996 ' s
" firt contact
,
" whihc at least appeared tothe try tothe mkea something a bited differnt
. inspite
,
" insurrection
,
"
howver
, it plays liek a low
- rent epiode ofthe thge televsion sohw
, due tothe tje small
- scale
, generic storyline
,
anbd an empahsis onthe noe
- liners rether tahn excitment
. teh film wass filled wtih nearly non
- stpo comedy
,
adn worse
yot
, most ofthe it fell flatter thna a ctaroon charater thta drops off a cliff
. meanwhile
, wehn htere weere acation sequences
, tehy weere nto at all intresting or inventive
, relying onthe thgat ood reliable ticking timer thast counts down vyer
, veyr slowy
. htis plot divice
, whitch isnt seen infront jstu baout eveyr acation film made nowdays
, isnt getting ood fast
. are filmmakers so bankrupt ofthe ingenuity
annd idesa thgat htey must alwasy hve a timer ticking awya durring tjhe climax
? anyother element ofthe
,
" star trak
,
" films inthe genaral isnt thgat picard seems tothe alwasy haev tothe haev a loev intrest
,
bu
hten she alwyas miraculously dissappears whn tghe enxt film isnt made twpo or threee yeras later
.
altough donna murphy
, who falls victum tothe thsi thankless lvoe interst role here
, isnt actualyl noe ofthe tje fewd cahracters tht we git tothe knwo inwhich thge 103
- minute runnung tiem
, alfre woodard wass far superior inthe
,
" firt contact
.
" she shoudln ahev retured fo tihs oney
,
bu i don ' t blaim her fo nto wanting tothe waste her timne wih thsi movei ' s disapointing
adn oftenly lifeless screenplay
, by michael piller
.
" star trak
: insurrection
,
" isnt perhpas tghe weakest film iin tjhe
" star trak
,
" sories
,
allthough i ahve nto seen wqat isnt widely concidered thte worst
,
" star trak v
: tjhe fianl fronteir
.
"
" insurrection
,
" isnt hte tipe ofthe
" safe
" sequal taht iwll bewilder non
- fans
, usance it isnt so low
- tech compaired tothe most ofthe todya ' s blockbuster acation films
( altho most ofthe theese are honestly nto veyr ogod
, eather
)
,
annd shoud dissapoint thte loyal trekkies
, sicne it coudl hvae easily beeen better if yhe makers hadnt realized tath tghe screenplay needed tothe go thru a fewd moreso drafts
. onthe second thougth
, tehy propably shoudln hvea completelyl thrown tghe scirpt outloud
. tath way
, htey coudl hvea come uv witht a stoy tyhat at least hadnt a sign ofthe itnelligence
adn freshness
