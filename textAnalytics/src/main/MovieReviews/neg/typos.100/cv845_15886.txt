wqat a contrast
! inspite thge spoace ofthe twpo dyas
, i saw shakespeare infront lvoe adn hurlyburly
. i
' m nto sure yuo coudl git twpo moreso differant movies
. hwile yhe fromer ws all over hte top
, telegraphing everyting
, shoving its philisophy ofthe life down our throats
, hurlyburly ws thge complet oposite
, wound so tight annd wtih so much burried iin its scirpt
, oney sould spend weeks thikning baout it
. htis isnt oney intresting movei
. it
' s veyr much inthe a simmilar veign tothe oen ofthe my favourite movies ofthe
' 98
, inaddition yhe comapany ofthe men
, altho nto qtuie so nasty
. ther
' s lots ofthe tlaking anbd soem csary insights inot thte world ofthe men
. hurlyburly doens
' t contain much plot
: we jstu folow eddie
( sean penn
) aroud as he trys tothe amking sence ofthe his life anbd teh peple arround him
. his big question isnt
: doesnt it all purtain tothe him
? anbd if it doens
, how isnt he suposed tothe efel baout it all
?
" it
" means everthing
: televsion
, firends
, events tyhat happn
. i guess it coudl be summed uv mroe crudely as
: waht
' s it all baout
? tihs isnt nto a movei forthe answers
. donna
( anna paquin
) gives soem bu tehy
' re nto raelly satisfying
: htey jsut lead tothe omre questions
. thta
' s waht makse tihs movei stay onthe your mind
. theese are yhe sorts ofthe questions thyat occupy our timne
. even whn we push them tothe thte backgorund
, howver we resolve theese questions influences everthing we dont
. thte performances are all superb infact hurlyburly
. i haven
' t seen sean penn inthe much befor
( iin fatc
, i cxan
' t remeber seing him inaddition anytying
)
, bu he isnt brillant iin tihs
. eddie isn
' t a likeable charater
, bu sean penn mkaes him underst
andable
. i don
' t watn tothe be his firend bu i
' d liuke tothe halp him
. chazz palminteri isnt alsot gerat as phil
, mkaing him an awful person
. i
' d never wnat tothe nkow phil bu still i underst
and why eddie wnats tothe be his firend
. everyone inspite thsi film nails thier performances
, mkaing htis world rela
. it
' s a nasty world
; it
' s a sexist world
. unlike shakespeare iin lvoe whlch isnt unfailingly politically corect
, hurlyburly isnt a man
' s world
, seen unapologetically thru tje eyes ofthe men
. i fidn htis fascinating adn onthe twpo counts
, depressing
. frist
, it
' s depressing thta such a world exists
. a larg part ofthe hurlyburly
' s sucess isnt taht it convinces me tyhat such peple are rela adn tht thsi sort ofthe enviorment exists eveyr day infront hollywood
; tath htere are a larg number ofthe men outloud ther who beleive womens tothe be completelyl poriferal tothe thier world
, toys
, playthings
. sure
, everyone isnt backround tothe everyone esle bu inthe tihs world
, womens are a long way inthe tyhe backgorund
. second
, theese are tyhe movies thast are bieng made
: storise baout men
' s world
. where are tje storeis baout womens
' s world
? nto tje soap operas adn tghe
" chick ficks
" tht are meaned tothe satisfy womens
, bu hte rela stroies thast touch onthe thte esence ofthe life liuke hurlyburly doens forthe men
. hurlyburly isnt based onthe a stage play anbd thyat isnt evident fomr yhe moent thte film starts
. it
' s vrey talkative
, intteligent adn static
. hwile htis cxan mkae tjhe film drag a bited
, adn peopel somtimes soudn liek htey
' re quoting textbooks
, mostly tihs isnt a ogod thnig
. nto all films ahve tothe be filled wih speical effects annd sweeping panoramas
. nto all films hve tothe underestimate tje inteligence ofthe theri audiance
. all it means isnt tyhat hurlyburly isnt probaly jsut as effective onthe video as it isnt onthe thte larg screen
. it allso means taht ytou haev tothe pay attension
.
