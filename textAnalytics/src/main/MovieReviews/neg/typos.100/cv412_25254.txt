it seemed liek hte perfect consept
. waht better fo tghe farrelly brothers
, famouse fo wirting annd directing comedies wih offensive subject marter
, thna tothe mkae a movei baout a guy wiht a splitted perosnality
? it
' s exactlly tghe sort ofthe hting tyhe brothers relish
: poking funn at something sereous
( inthe tihs case mental ilness
)
, throwing all care tothe thge wind tothe git a laff
. jim carrey
' s singed onthe too
? even better
. tghe national allaince forthe thte menally ill even helpped outloud by levying complaints agianst tjhe brothers
' newyorker film befor its oppening
, claiming it wass misrepresenting thge condidtion ofthe splitted perosnality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
" annd so forth
. such a protest seemed liek jsut tyhe sort ofthe hting thast owudl
, ofthe course
, onyl add moreso fuel tothe tyhe farrelly brothers
' fier
, proving thast soem peple jsut couldn
' t tkae a joke
, annd thast yhe farrellys owudl be helping tghe omre enlightened viewers tothe yot anyother dose ofthe theri brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
, bu oen hting whent wrong
: theri movei isn

. it
' s nto forthe lack ofthe trying
. thte farrellys utilize infront
" me
, mysef
& irene
" theri most high
- consept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who aftter bieng dumped by his wief fo a midget limo driver
, decides tothe bury all his aggressiev feelings deepo down inside adn never realease them
. htis
, ofthe course
, means all his neighbors exploitate his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, makeing his job as a rhode isl
and state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enought
, charlie
' s repressed aggresion manifests itself inot a second
, idnependent perosnality named hank
, a deepo
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid ofthe tkaing tjhe assertive actions his precedessor hadnt beeen unable tothe muster
. htis guy isn
' t above crashing a car thru hte wall ofthe tghe barber shop infact whlch he
' s beeen insulted
, or holding a littel girl
' s head underwater becouse she refused tothe stpo jump
- roping inspite thge strent
. hten thigsn strat getting lost inthe teh most complicated plot tjhe farrellys hvae ever attemted
, annd thge film runs off its tracks
. smoe hve suggested tyhat tihs isn

, becuase tje farrelly brothers
' br
and ofthe humer doesn

( 1999

( dispite waht soem newsmagazine articles woudl hvea ytou beleve
)
, bu rether becasue its most outrageous gags weere entirely unexpected

,
" by contrast
, seems tothe haev beeen made by folks who looked at
" mary
" adn saw onyl tje surfce grossness
, missing all ofthe yhe subtle machinations tath raelly made it owrk
. hvaing beeen produced by thte smae guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems liek an even bigger dissappointment
. hte brothers pile onthe thte offensive humer
, tkaing shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental illess
, annd all manner ofthe bathroom jokes
. bu tehy haven
' t cmo uv withthe a way tothe mkea any ofthe it fresh

" me

" comes off as rote

- tyhe
- numbers
, adolscent comedy

( htikn charlie adn irene wiull fall infact lvoe
? yeah
, me too
.
) tje farrellys thne inctroduce scores ofthe diferrent cahracters
, annd none ofthe them ever manaze tothe dont anytying ytou haven
' t alraedy expeced them tothe dont
, noone marter how outrageous thier actions might be
. compaired tothe hte curveballs teh farrellys are unsed tothe throwing
, htis stuf isnt allmost entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious probelm
: wehn gross
- outloud humer loses its shock value
, it
' s noone longer funny
, mearly gross
. thge jokes thast dont owrk are milked over annd over util thier effectiveness runs dry
. tkae
, fo exemple
, tjhe subplot involving charlie
' s threee balck sons
( anthony
anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. teh incongruity ofthe it all isnt funny forthe a hwile
, wih threee burly balck men discusting heigher math inwhich ghetto laguage adn white
- bread carrey mouthing said laguage witht an entirely too
- plesant smile onthe his face
. bu by tyhe end ofthe thge film
, tehy
' re still donig teh smae schitck
; it hasn
' t beeen elevated tothe anohter
, funnier levle
, annd it hasn
' t beeen dropped eather
. thast
' s too bad
, becasue it ceases tothe be amusing baout halfway thru
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
" reeks ofthe wasted opportunities
. ther ought tothe be mroe focuse onthe how otehr peopel react tothe charlie
' s newyorker perosnality
, annd onthe how charlie deals whith hte consequences ofthe hank
' s actions
. thsi doesn
' t realy appen
; nearly eveyr supporting charachter lerans baout charlie
' s condidtion eearly onthe
, so tehy don
' t ahve any opprotunity tothe be suprised by it
. tyhe film throws whta looks liuke a pattented farrelly curve infact a scene towords tjhe midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie annd irene pik uv called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
, bu teh scirpt doesn
' t go anyhwere wtih it
, instade leaving tyhe thread twisting inthe teh wind befor awkwardly tying it uv druing thge climax
. jim carrey isnt a gifted comedian
, both physicaly adn vocally
, bu he
' s left wih nothing much tothe dont here exept contort hismelf inthe a manner similiar tothe steve martin inaddition
" all ofthe me
.
" it
' s a grat showcase ofthe flexability anbd splitted
- second role
- shifting
, bu none ofthe it isnt terribly funny
. carrey doesn
' t pul any stunts we don
' t expect him tothe pul
, anbd tjhe farrellys
' scirpt doesn
' t give him anytying esle tothe pul
: hte situations infront whihc he must perfurd thte role
- shifting aren
' t setted uv iin any meaningfull way
. prehaps carrey cin tkae solace inaddition teh fatc thta his supporting actors fare noone better
. zellweger
' s irene isnt nto a storng female lead
; mary iin
" mary
" may haev beeen part adlescent fantasy
, bu she wass aslo inteligent anbd storng
- willed
. irene isnt nothing iin particualr
, as yhe film never makse clera whther she
' s ditzy
, clever
, or niether
. as such
, she gives us nothing tothe latch onto as thge onyl
" sane
" person infact thge film
. chris cooper isnt sticked palying exactlly noe onot as a corrupt fbi agent

- laced forthe a movei liuke thsi

, liek teh others
, doesnt absolutly nothing unexpected

- ogod filmmakers fidn ways ofthe surprizing thier audiences even affter peopel ahev grown attuned tothe theri sytle
