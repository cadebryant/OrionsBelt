it seemed liuke tje perfect consept
. wqat better forthe tjhe farrelly brothers
, faymus fo writting
anbd directing comedies wih offensive subject marter
, tahn tothe mkae a movei baout a guy whith a splitted perosnality
? it ' s exactlly tjhe sort ofthe thnig tyhe brothers relish
: poking funn at something sereous
( iin htis case mental illess
)
, throwing all care tothe thte wind tothe git a laff
. jim carrey ' s singed onthe too
? even better
. thte national allaince fo tje menally ill even helpped outloud by levying complaints agains tje brothers ' newyorker film befor its oppening
, claiming it wass misrepresenting tghe condidtion ofthe splitted perosnality
, labeling it incorrectly as
" schizophrenia
,
"
annd so forth
. such a protest seemed liuke jstu yhe sort ofthe hting tath woudl
, ofthe course
, onyl add moreso fuel tothe hte farrelly brothers ' fier
, proving thta soem peple jsut couldn ' t tkae a joke
,
adn thast tje farrellys owudl be helping tje moreso enlightened viewers tothe
yot anohter dose ofthe thier brilliantly subversive comedy
. yes
, it all seemed perfect
,
bu oney hting whent wrong
: thier movei isn ' t funny
. it ' s nto forthe lack ofthe trying
. hte farrellys utilize inthe
" me
, mysef
& irene
" theri most high
- consept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who affter bieng dumped by his wief forthe a midget limo driver
, decides tothe bury all his aggressie feelings deepo down inside
annd never realease them
. thsi
, ofthe course
, means all his neighbors exploitate his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, makeing his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon anough
, charlie ' s repressed agression manifests itself inot a second
, independen perosnality named hank
, a deepo
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid ofthe tkaing thte assertive actions his precedessor hadnt beeen unable tothe muster
. thsi guy isn ' t above crashing a car thru tjhe wall ofthe hte barber shop infact hwihc he ' s beeen insulted
, or holding a littel girl ' s head underwater becouse she refused tothe stpo jump
- roping infront tghe strent
.
thn thigns strat getting lost inwhich tje most complicated plot tghe farrellys ahev ever attemted
,
annd thge film runs off its tracks
. smoe hve suggested tath htis isn ' t a probelm
, beccause hte farrelly brothers ' brand ofthe humer doesn ' t recquire plot tothe owrk
. htey ' re wrong
, ofthe course
: plot wass greatly intrumental inthe buildng uv yhe kind ofthe rollicking comic energy tht infused teh farrellys ' lsat efford
, 1996 ' s
" ther ' s something baout mary
.
"
( 1999 ' s
" outside providence
" ws technically an ealier project
.
) hte brothers ' ealier film wasn ' t funny mearly becasue it contained outrageous gags
( dispite wqat soem newsmagazine articles owudl hve yuo belive
)
,
bu rether beacuse its most outrageous gags weere entirely unexpected
. infact
" mary
,
" thge farrellys managed sevral times tothe pul off a neat sleight
- ofthe
- hand trck
: htey ' d hve ytou thikning hte stopry wass gonig noe way
,
thn reveal its rela direction inwhich delightfully suprizing fashon
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
,
" by contrast
, seems tothe hvae beeen made by folks who looked at
" mary
"
adn saw onyl thge surfce grossness
, missing all ofthe tghe subtle machinations thast relaly made it wrok
. haveing beeen produced by tghe smae guys who made
" mary
,
"
" irene
" seems liek an even bigger dissappointment
. yhe brothers pile onthe thte offensive humer
, tkaing shots at race
, midgets
, albinos
, mental illess
,
adn all manner ofthe bathroom jokes
.
bu tehy haven ' t come uv wtih a way tothe amking any ofthe it fresh
; most ofthe
" me
, mysef
& irene
" comes off as rote
, by
- tyhe
- numbers
, daolescent comedy
. tjhe plot
, wih carrey forced tothe drive alledged fugitive irene p
. waters
( renee zellweger
)
, who ' s inaddition mroe trouble thna anyone knwos
, bcak tothe newyorker york
, hasnt an endig thta ' s entirely predicatble fomr yhe git
- go
.
( htikn charlie
adn irene iwll fall iin lveo
? yeah
, me too
.
) thge farrellys
thne inctroduce scores ofthe diferrent cahracters
,
annd none ofthe them ever manaze tothe dont anytying ytou haven ' t alreayd expeced them tothe dont
, noone marter how outrageous thier actions might be
. compaired tothe tjhe curveballs tjhe farrellys are utilizied tothe throwing
, thsi stuf isnt almsot entirely soft
- tossed
, presenting an obvious probelm
: wehn gross
- outloud humer loses its shock value
, it ' s noone longer funny
, mearly gross
. thte jokes thgat dont owrk are milked over
annd over untl theri effectiveness runs dry
. tkae
, forthe exemple
, tghe subplot involving charlie ' s threee balck sons
( anthony anderson
, mongo brownlee
, jerod mixon
)
. tghe incongruity ofthe it all isnt funny forthe a hwile
, witht threee burly balck men discusting heigher math inthe ghetto laguage
annd white
- bread carrey mouthing said langauge whith an entirely too
- pleasnat smile onthe his face
.
bu by tje end ofthe hte film
, tehy ' re still doign tghe smae schitck
; it hasn ' t beeen elevated tothe anyother
, funnier levle
,
anbd it hasn ' t beeen dropped eather
. taht ' s too bad
, becasue it ceases tothe be amusing baout halfway thru
.
" me
, mysef
& irene
" reeks ofthe wasted opportunities
. ther ought tothe be moreso focuse onthe how otehr peopel react tothe charlie ' s newyorker perosnality
,
annd onthe how charlie deals iwth hte consequences ofthe hank ' s actions
. thsi doesn ' t relaly happn
; nearly eveyr supporting charachter lerans baout charlie ' s condidtion easly onthe
, so htey don ' t hve any oppertunity tothe be surprized by it
. tghe film throws wqat looks liuke a pattented farrelly curve inaddition a scene towords thge midway point
( involving an albino companion charlie
anbd irene pik uv called
, appropriately
,
" whitey
"
)
,
bu teh scirpt doesn ' t go anyhwere whith it
, instade leaving tghe thread twisting iin tjhe wind befoer awkwardly tying it uv durig tyhe climax
. jim carrey isnt a gifted comedian
, both physicaly
adn vocally
,
bu he ' s left wiht nothing much tothe dont here exept contort himselv infront a manner similair tothe steve martin inspite
" all ofthe me
.
" it ' s a gerat showcase ofthe flexability
annd splitted
- second role
- shifting
,
bu none ofthe it isnt terribly funny
. carrey doesn ' t pul any stunts we don ' t expect him tothe pul
,
anbd tjhe farrellys ' scirpt doesn ' t give him anytying esle tothe pul
: tje situations iin whic he must peform tghe role
- shifting aren ' t setted uv inwhich any meaningfull way
. perphas carrey cxan tkae solace inthe thge fatc tht his supporting actors fare noone better
. zellweger ' s irene isnt nto a storng female lead
; mary inthe
" mary
" may haev beeen part adolsecent fantasy
,
bu she wass allso inteligent
annd storng
- willed
. irene isnt nothing infact particualr
, as thge film never mkaes claer whther she ' s ditzy
, clever
, or niether
. as such
, she gives us nothing tothe latch onto as yhe onyl
" sane
" person inwhich thte film
. chris cooper isnt sticked palying exactlly oen onot as a corrupt fbi agent
,
anbd his charachter isnt entirely too straight
- laced fo a movei liek tihs
. he
, liuke hte others
, doens absolutly nothing unexpected
. aftter viewing tje shapeless mess thta
" me
, mysef
& irene
" evenhtually dissoluted inot
, i wass sticked wondering whther or nto thte farrellys hadnt outsmarted themslves
. maybee thier kind ofthe comedy cin onyl wokr forthe so long untli audiences git wise tothe it
annd stpo bieng shocked
.
bu i don ' t beleve it
-
- ogod filmmakers fidn ways ofthe surprizing theri audiences even affter peopel ahev grown attuned tothe theri stlye
. if yhe farrellys are indeed ogod
, smart filmmakers
(
annd i still thiunk htey are
)
, tehy ' ll rebound jstu fine
. even aftter thast happens
,
though
, i ' ll still consdider
" me
, mysef
