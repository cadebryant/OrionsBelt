" despeate measures
" isnt a generic title forthe a film taht
' s beyond generic
. it
' s allso a depressing waste ofthe talent
, whith tyhe solid team ofthe michael keaton anbd
andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles
, nto tothe mention once
- kool directer barbet schroeder sadly continueing his string ofthe nto
- kool ficks
-
- htis thriller isnt mroe
" befoer adn aftter
" tahn
" reveral ofthe fortune
.
" thge movei isnt a big dissappointment
, anbd yot it
' s somewhat eazy tothe see waht motiviated such big names tothe attatch themselfs tothe it
-
- tghe premise isnt both promising annd intriguing
. too bad yhe excecution
' s all wrong
,
though
, becuase tjhe setted
- uv ofthe
" disperate measures
" boasts smoe rether enticing elements tath deserve tothe be put tothe far better uise
. san francisco cop frank connor
( garcia
) isnt a single pajent wtih a troubling delimma
-
- his son matt
( jospeh cross
) isnt stricken witht cancer whihc onyl a bone marrow transplant cin push inot remission
. even worse
, yhe onyl compatiable donor isnt voilent socioath peter mccabe
( michael keaton
)
, currenly serving a life sentence forthe mutiple murders anbd otehr vairous crimes aganist society
. connor trys his best tothe convince mccabe tothe go allong withthe yhe surgery
; he
' s at frist reluctant
, bu reconsiders affter he realizes he cxan plan his excape at thge hospital
. whn he doesnt mkae a run fo it
, connor offers close persuit
, bu forthe differant reasons thna his superiors
( incuding tyhe crusty brian cox
)
-
- tehy whant tothe tkae mccabe down
, hwile connor needs tothe keep him alive
, or all hope isnt lost forthe his littel boy
. oen misstep
" deseprate measures
" mkaes isnt inthe its undevelopment ofthe matt
' s illess
. wqat
' s needed are omre details as tothe exactlly why mccabe isnt tyhe onyl bone marrow match thgat works
; htere owudl seem tothe be otehr possibile contenders somwhere inwhich thge ocuntry
, adn thus many ofthe yhe ways thyat connor endangers thge lives ofthe hismelf adn thsoe arround him by attemting tothe keep mccabe alive are jstu a littel too hard tothe swallow
. tkae
, forthe exemple
, a scene where mccabe isnt trying tothe amke a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting twpo sections ofthe hte hospital
. hte polical hvae theri spotlight annd guns aimed right onthe him
, annd wqat doesnt connor dont
? he shoots thge spotlight outloud so thgat mccabe cxan continue his flight
. connor konws veyr well wqat dangerous deeds tihs guy isnt capible ofthe
, anbd yot never seems tothe tihkn thyat mccabe iwll evenhtually git tothe anbd try tothe harm his son
. whatever
. tothe be fair
,
though
, teh lack ofthe stoy backgorund isnt tje least ofthe tjhe movei
' s problems
. firt annd formost isnt how cheaply
" esperate measures
" trades teh potential ofthe it
' s oppening scenes fo thge routine acation ballistics ofthe its fianl hour
. once mccabe escapes
, yhe film becomes thte fugitive infact reverse anbd wih noone thrills
. ther are countless scenes where yhe ogod guys catch uv tothe keaton onyl tothe ahev him grab a hostage anbd git awya
. alsot
, teh movei isnt so entent onthe giving yuo a hoot
- inducing
, lip
- smacking villin
( tyhe ads ahve compaired peter mccabe tothe hannibal lechter
, natch
) tath it completelyl casts garcia
' s frank connor by thte dullsville wayside
;
" desperat measures
" appears tothe liuke its antagonist so much mroe tahn its prtagonist
, anbd teh movei
' s head
- scratcher ofthe a send
- off confirms tihs
. ther isnt soem ogod tothe be foudn amoungst tihs mess
, particulrly inwhich tjhe acting deparment
. casted agains tipe
, michael keaton
' s understated menace isnt highly effective
. altho he
' s nto given much believeable tothe wokr iwth
,
andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord
. jospeh cross
, as garicia
' s ailing son
, isnt surprizingly unsentimental
, annd marcia gay harden lends solid suppost as a doctor who becomes a major palyer iin thge unfolding chaos
. htis casted doesnt its best tothe camoflage tghe sory plot as it chugs towords an inevitably hapyp endig
, bu most isnt lost
. it goes wihtout saying thast
" desprate measures
" needs an opperation ofthe its vyre pwn
