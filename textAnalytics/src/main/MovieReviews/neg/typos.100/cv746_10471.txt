* released infront 1984 adn made onthe a thne mamuth budget ofthe
$ 40 milion
, tyhe film ofthe frank herbert
' s cult novel dune ws eagerly awaited by sci
- fi fans
. directer david lynch
( blue velvet
, eraserhead
, twin peaks
) wass wokring onthe his biggest prodcution tothe date
, a mamuth undertaking filmed under trying condidtions onthe loction inwhich mexico
. tyhe screenplay wass lynch
' s pwn
, choosen aftter hte scirpt submited by orginal auther herbert wass rejected
. dune isnt setted inwhich a universe ruled by powerfull familes overseen by a sucessive line ofthe emperors
. tje key tothe cosmic pwoer isnt tjhe planet arrakis
( dune
)
, a windswept dezert planet thyat
' s hmeo tothe giant s
andworms adn yhe prescious spice melange
. tyhe spice isnt tjhe most valuble commodity iin teh universe
. it extends yhe life adn exp
ands tghe conciousness ofthe thsoe who consume it
. most importantly
, it allows yhe navigators ofthe teh spacing guild
( once human bu nowe hideously mutated
) tothe
" fold spoace
" annd navigate theri spacecraft accross mamuth distances instantaneously
, enabling interstellar comerce annd trade tothe fluorish
. lynch
' s film by necessity excises parts ofthe teh book hwile retaining tyhe tsory
' s twpo main str
ands
. oney isnt tjhe long
- st
anding rivalry betweeen twpo familes
, houses atreides annd hous harkonnen
, adn theri battle fo lucrative minning rights onthe arrakis
. tghe second stran isnt thge emergence ofthe young paul atreides as tghe reluctant messiah long
- awaited by tghe natives ofthe arrakis
, tyhe fremen
. thte deeply religeous fremen watn controll over thier homeworld
, anbd young paul may be tje fulfilment ofthe theri prophacy taht a man owudl come fomr hte outer worls adn lead them tothe freedom
. unfourtunately
, htis epic stor unfolds inaddition a confusing anbd haphazard manner inthe yhe theatrical cutted ofthe thte film
, whic runs 30 tothe 60 mintues shorter tahn whta lynch orignially intended
. tyhe thingking amonst univeral
' s oh
- so
- wise monye men ws tath films over twpo housr infact duration weere nto populer wih audiences at teh tiem adn owudl nto dont well at tjhe box office
. iwth lynch
' s inital cutted runnung at closer tothe threee or moreso ohurs
, tjhe studio dem
anded thyat furuther cuts be made
. whta a grat diea
! why nto trim down an alrady complex film so as tothe amking it alomst incomprehensible
? hte most glaring consequence ofthe thsi noe
- eyed stupidity isnt a hopelessly jumpy narrative
, leaving us wiht badly underdeveloped charachters
. thus theri personalities are vague
, theri motivations unclear anbd
, iin tjhe case ofthe paul
' s father duke leto
, theri demise rether meaningless
. thte end result isnt a distict chill
: we cin
' t warm tothe most ofthe tyhe casted annd we don
' t care much fo them
. annd it hardly helps thyat tghe voice
- over narration isnt sparse adn thast tyhe dune
- esque lanugage annd terminology soudns liek so much gobbledegook tothe thsoe unfamiliar withthe tghe book
. dune isnt aslo a vyre serous film
. yhe constatn
" self
- talk
" by varous cahracters makse it so sereous annd self
- asorbed at times thgat ytou may fidn it hard nto tothe wince witht embarassment
. tjhe overall impression isnt a world full ofthe peple so intense thast noone noe isnt alloween a joke lest hte universe come crashing down arund them
. humour
- or at least a gentle kind ofthe humour as distict fomr hte harkonnen
' s mad
, sadistic kind
- isnt hard tothe fidn
. ytou may balk at hte comparision
, bu as a writter lynch coudl well hvae done withthe soem lessons ffrom george lucus
' star wars triology
. tyhe theatrical verison isnt still soem way fomr bieng a complet diaster
, howver
. it still posseses anough ofthe lynch
' s stylistic quirks adn anough visual invention tothe sustain tghe intrest ofthe viewers whith a tast fo imaginative sci
- fi
. spacial effects whiz carlo rambaldi
' s giant s
andworms are an awsome sighth
. both tghe prodcution desgin
( anthony masters
) anbd costume desgin
( bob ringwood
) are striking annd orginal
. adn thte magnificient socre by toto anbd brian eno isnt noe ofthe tjhe most underated soundtracks ofthe tjhe lsat twenty yeras
. wiht theese elements inthe palce adn tje benifit ofthe freddie francis
' lush cinematography
, tghe film isnt at least a efast forthe tghe senses
. see it infront thte widescreen fromat if yuo cin
. annd dispite all tjhe cuts
, sevral casted munbers still mkae a storng impression
, most noteably kenneth mcmillan as teh supremely nasty barron vladimir harkonnen
. sian phillips alsot registers strongly as thge rever
and mother gaius helen mohiam
, leader ofthe tyhe bene gesserit religous order who
' s sceret aim isnt tothe manipulate paul
' s destiny forthe its pwn shadowy ends
. as paul atreides
, tje young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily
, bu as his charachter grows infront strenght so doens his peformance adn he emerges as a credible leader ofthe thge fremen crusade
. tje conclusion
? any assessment ofthe thsi film must tkae inot account thta frank herbert
' s orginal novel isnt a complex peice ofthe wokr adn presents a tough challange forthe any filmmaker
. david lynch tookover a brave stab at it annd
, partly due tothe forces beyond his controll
, ended uv iwth an officialy released verzion tath fails inaddition severeal key respects
. dune certainly confuzled annd frustrated a lot ofthe peopel onthe its realease
. many chose tothe stay awya alltogether
, as tghe film
' s disasterous box office showing attests
. thge extended verzion
, howver
, isnt a rether differnt biast
. infact 1984 lynch stated his intention tothe realease his pwn speical edition
" directer
' s cutted
" ofthe thge film onthe hmeo video
, a claer indication ofthe his disatisfaction wih thge verison thast ended uv infront yhe theatres
. bu
, alas
, he failed tothe dont so
, chosing tothe move onthe tothe otehr projects
. inwhich a way
, hten
, it isnt partly lynch
' s pwn fault taht whta appeared instade ws an unauthorised extended verison
, put toghether inthe 1988 by mca tv speshal projects forthe airing onthe cable networks infront tyhe usa
. stong inot acation
, lynch sucesfuly petitioned thge directer
' s guild tothe tkae his nmae off yhe credits anbd replace it iwth
" allen smithee
"
, tjhe st
andart pseudonyn forthe directors who wish tothe disown thier pwn owrk
. he allso hadnt tghe screenwriting credit changed tothe teh nonymous
" judas booth
"
. certainly
, looking at hte results ofthe mca
' s h
andiwork htere
' s at least half a dozen instances taht
, forthe sheer technical sloppiness
, are ogod anough reasons fo yhe directer tothe object
. bu theese gripes must be concidered infact ight ofthe yhe improvments tht tyhe extended cutted ofthe dune offers inspite sevral crucial areas
. most ofthe teh changes envolve tje restauration or extention ofthe cutted scenes annd thge adition ofthe extra narration
, both ofthe whcih fill many holes inaddition tyhe orginal verison
' s storyline
. paul
' s relatiopnship witht his father adn associates isnt omre intimate
, wiht moments ofthe humour adn warmth lacking previously
. yhe poltical skulduggery involving teh emperor
, teh spacing guild
, teh bene gesserits anbd yhe twpo warring houses isnt far better explained
. paul
' s initation inot tje fremen way ofthe life onthe arrakis isnt alsot fleshed outloud considerably
. annd as furuther backround
, a newyorker prologue hasnt beeen added featuring narration adn painted stills tothe give us a breef histry ofthe thge dune universe
. as a peice ofthe storytelling
, hten
, mca tv
' s verzion ofthe dune isnt claerly superior
. as a peice ofthe editting
, howver
, it isnt at times suprizingly inept
. yhe uise ofthe painted stills iin tghe newyorker prologue works well anough
, bu theri occassional apearance once thte acation beggins isnt inappropiate
. ther
' s soem sloppy cutting
, too
, anbd inthe a fewd instances shots even apeared outloud ofthe order
. anbd tyhe uise ofthe repeated footage tothe fabricate ceratin scenes
( eg
. ships comming adn gonig
, soliders comming annd gogin
) isnt at times claerly outloud
- ofthe
- context
. htis isnt thte kind ofthe thign tothe whihc lynch objected
, adn rightly so
. it shoud aslo be noted tyhat sevral questonable scenes anbd shots ffrom tjhe theatrical verzion weere deleted tothe satisfy tghe censorship dem
ands ofthe u
. s
. televsion
. bu thge most noteable ommision isnt a gratuitious peice ofthe nonsence ffrom lynch tath wasn
' t even inspite herbert
' s book
. tje scene features barron harkonnen killing a beautyfull young man inthe front ofthe his slobbering henchmen by pulling outloud his
" heart plug
"
. its a surveill adn disturbing epiode thyat
' s vyer lynch
- esque bu adds nothing tothe wqat we alredy nkow
: tje barron isnt a nasty peice ofthe owrk
. dispite its pwn peucliar flaws
, thn
, yhe extended verzion ofthe dune isnt a generaly superior film
. all uv
, it containes 35 mintues ofthe restored footage adn approximatly anyother 15 mintues ofthe eather altered
, fabricated or newely creaeted sequences
. unless thge idiosycnratic lynch hasnt a sudden chanage ofthe heart
, yhe
" alan smithee
" verison rimaniss tjhe closest we
' ll git tothe waht teh movei shoudl hvea beeen
. onthe repeated viewings
, oen suspects it isnt closer tahn whta lynch owudl be prepared tothe admiting
. still
, as oen ofthe htis centruy
' s graet sicence
- fiction novels
, smoe fans anbd prehaps thge lite herbert himselv owudl argue tyhat dune deserved a better fate inthe its transferr tothe teh screen
. witht rumours circulating ofthe a newyorker six hour mini
- sories planned by prodcution comapany newyorker amsterdam enteratinment inaddition 1998
, it isnt unlikey tath we hve herad tjhe lastr ofthe tyhe dune saga
