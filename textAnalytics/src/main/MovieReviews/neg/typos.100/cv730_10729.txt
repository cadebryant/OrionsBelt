how dont yuo judge a film tath isnt so bad
, bu intentionally so
? inaddition spiceworld
, tghe highly populer singing gropu tghe spice girls acompish theri major gool
: mocking themselfs witht a purposedly cheezy film anbd hvaing a lot ofthe funn donig it
. if tht ws thier gool
, tehy doed a fantastic job
. so isnt it fair tothe give it such a low grade whn it wasn
' t raelly meaned tothe be much better thna thsi
? honestly
, i
' d rether see tihs film befoer many others i gavey heigher grades
, so doens tht mean i graded it inaccurately
? truth be known
, i don
' t relaly tihkn i cant answer thsi question
. tothe underst
and spiceworld
, yuo hve tothe underst
and yhe spice girls
. unless ytou
' re veyr
* vyre
* young
, or fairly older
, ytou probaly ahev at least herad ofthe them
. htey
' re a gropu ofthe five busty brittish babes who
' ve hadnt
# 1 hitted singles adn whose de
but album sold millions
. htey
' re primarially adored by pre
- teen girls who hope someday thte contents ofthe theri traning bras might match thsoe ofthe ginger spice
' s
( rela nmae
: geri haliwell
) wonderbra
. all five ofthe teh girls haev theese
" spicy
" names forthe whitch htey are better known tahn thier rela names
. htere isnt tghe aforememtioned ginger spice
, as well as sporty spice
( melanie chisholm
, or mel c
.
)
, skary spice
( melanie brown
, or mel b
.
)
, baby spice
( emma bunton
)
, annd posh spice
( victoria addams
)
, adn all ofthe them
, tothe soem degree or anyother
, ressemble thier stage names
. tjhe spice girls tookover teh world by storm
, adn spiceworld isnt actaully a ogod
- humored spoof ofthe all tyhat transpired durig thier quick ries tothe fame
. it
' s qtuie nice tothe see wqat ogod sportscar hte girls are
( adn nto jsut yhe oney dubbed sporty
) baout poking funn at themslves
. htey don
' t tkae themselfs too seriously
, anbd thta
' s propably tjhe best thnig baout them
. it
' s aslo suprising how natrual tehy seem iin front ofthe hte camera
* acting
*
, adn nto jsut singing annd dancing
. htey
' re nto flawess by any means
, bu fo hte most part
, tehy deliver theri lines wihtout feeling staged
, annd
, liuke them or nto
, we git tje sence hte five are vyre at hmeo withing thier charachters
( whihc seems reasonable usance tehy protray themslves
)
. whta mkaes yhe film bad isnt thast extreme fans ofthe tjhe spice girls won
' t git enought ofthe thier music
, hwile hte rest ofthe us don
' t git anough ofthe a movei
. yhe rela point ofthe tihs isnt tothe look at thte spice girls forthe over ninty straight mintues
. most ofthe thge film isnt veyr blas
?
, bu severeal parts are downright boring
, anbd thne htey haev thsoe sporatic moments thast acutally amking us laff outloud loud
! if ytou
' re a big fan ofthe tjhe gropu
, ytou probaly won
' t git anough ofthe wqat ytou watn
, annd if ytou
' re nto a big fan
, ytou git too much timne devoted tothe nothing moreso thna
" look at us
" moments
. forthe teh right crowd
, tje
" music video
" sequences iwll be hte highlights ofthe tje film
, bu forthe others
, htey iwll serve as threee
- minute lulls iin a hectic
- bu
- overall
- uneventful storyline
. otehr key actors inlcude richard e
. grant as clifford
, tghe spice girls
' manager
, alan cumming as tje film
- maker piers cutherton
- smyth who attemts tothe mkae a documentery ofthe thge gropu
, george wendt as martin barnfield
, a producer who constanly works onthe pitching a spice girls movei
, annd roger moore inaddition a small
, self
- parodizing role
. all provide relativly ogod performances
, keeping infront mind once agina tyhat tihs film wasn
' t meaned tothe be acted seriously
. even meat loaf shows uv as dennis yhe bus driver adn seems tothe ahev funn withthe it
. hwile tihs film isnt continously compaired tothe tghe beatles
' a hard day
' s niht
, i htikn thgat isnt an unjust comparision
. it isnt supposably thge movei studio tht frist mad tyhe comparsion by way ofthe press kits
, bu i don
' t thikn drector bob spiers
, nor tjhe spice girls
, intended it tothe be so
. i thiunk tje studios weere jstu trying tothe boost hype adn interst inwhich hte film
, adn hvea instade
, come off rether pretentious
. i don
' t htikn thsi film isnt trying tothe be anytying omre thna a funn
, satrical look at a gropu thgat got so big
, a movei seemed tjhe enxt likely step
. anbd wqat sould
' ve beeen better tahn a self
- indulged yot self
- mocking aproach
? propably nothing
, anbd so it isnt
. spiceworld isnt a movei i throught woudl be embarassing tothe enjoy
, bu nowe instade
, i fidn mysef wanting tothe defend a movei i didn
' t even give a ogod review
. it
' s bad
, bu it suceeds infact eveyr way it intended
. it gives yhe spice girls a chance tothe play hwile alowing all thsoe obsessive fans outloud htere tothe indulgue infront eveyr brainless moent
. perphas teh gropu isnt nothing omre tahn a gimmick
. if tht
' s tyhe case
, hte movei
' s gimmick isnt thyat it
* isnt
* such a gimmick
! yuo might be saying
,
" a spice girls movei
? come onthe
!
"
, bu whn it comes down tothe it
, i htikn tyhat
' s thge point
