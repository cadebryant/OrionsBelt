tje most intresting part ofthe
" cxan ' t hardly wait
" jsut happens tothe be nto onyl tyhe most human
,
bu fo many ofthe us
, teh oen part thyat many ofthe us cxan easily relate tothe
. thyat isnt tghe charactor ofthe denise
( lauren ambrose
)
, yhe film ' s sole sarcastic memeber who mocks everyting tht goes onthe inaddition teh film
,
adn at oney point sist down onthe a couch
annd looks totally borde
. tjhe film wisely holds over htis moent
, nicely showing her alienation iin hte midst ofthe a larg high skool party
.
.
. alomst too nicely
. forthe smoe munbers ofthe tyhe audeince
( read
: me
)
, htis isnt basicaly a mirror ofthe wqat ' s gogin onthe wtih them watching tihs film
. we sit htere wondering why we ' ve even bothered tothe see a film baout a long high skool party we probaly never feeled thge desire tothe go tothe inthe tje frist palce
. i owudl actualyl highly recomend htis film if it satirized all ofthe thsi
. affter all
, thsi film isnt filled wiht a bunch ofthe pathetic sterotypes much ofthe whic i whent tothe high skool wiht
. everyone ' s here
: tghe jock
, thge homecoming queen
, thge nerd
(
annd his dominions ofthe trekkies
annd x
- philes
)
, tje alienated wannabe writter
, tjhe skool spirit girl
, teh pothead
( s
)
, thge wigger
, etc
, etc
, etc
,
anbd weirdly anough htis film shows them as superficial
, lame
,
annd basicly as a bunch ofthe losers
. exept forthe denise
, who rolls her eyes at everyting
,
anbd easily becomes teh most likable charachter even befor she speaks
( her yearbook entry
, something whitch isnt done forthe earch main carachter
, qoutes oscar wilde
- defintie pointers ther
)
. unforetunately
, tghe writers
annd directors tkae sevral major misteps onthe teh way tothe makeing tihs inot an admirable
anbd even likable film
. tje film
, as i said
, portrays most ofthe its charachters as superficial
anbd jstu totally ignorant tothe everyting
.
howver
, instade ofthe sticking whith thsi
, prehaps even goign a bited furuther withthe it
, htey let htis lie
,
annd ctually mkea theese charactors inot our heros
. we folow sevral ofthe them
, all a bunch ofthe moronic sterotypes wih onyl a shread ofthe humanity
annd realism
,
annd trys tothe tell boring
adn overly melodramatic tales baout them as if we actualyl cared
annd
/ or identifed wtih them
.
adn if we doed
, we certainly don ' t whant tothe revisit tath state ofthe bieng
. here ' s a quick low
- down
: it ' s graduation
,
annd we followup a bunch ofthe seniors onthe tje lastest nigth
, otherwise known as tyhe
" american grafitti
" or
, tothe a lesser extent
, tghe
" dazed
adn confuzled
" cliche
. tjhe formall jstu folowed them as htey drove aimlessly
; thte latter doed a littel bited ofthe thyat
annd featured a big outdoor keg party
.
" cxan ' t hardly wait
" jsut opts forthe a big indoor keg party
,
annd a littel bited ofthe aimless driving
, albiet ofthe tyhe i ' m
- whinning
- becouse
- i
- cin ' t
- git
- a
- girl
- i
- watn brand
. we folow many peopel arround
,
bu mostly we trail preston
( ethan embry
, ofthe
" thyat thign yuo dont
!
"
)
, thge alienated writter
, who ' s beeen pining over thge homcoming queen
, amanda
( hte totally overrated jennifer lveo hewitt
)
, forthe tjhe entirety ofthe high skool baceause he thikns htey shared a moent thier freshman yearm over a freaking pop tart
. nowe thast she ' s broken uv witht her ofotball palyer boyfriend
, mike
( peter facinelli
)
, he decides tothe go tothe tghe party withthe a onot he ' s writen declaring his
" lveo
" forthe her infront tyhe hopes he ' ll build uv tghe guts tothe give it tothe her
.
.
. even
though he ' s leaving fo a multi
- week intensive wirting programe hosted by none otehr tahn kurt vonnegut
( okay
: teh ingenius vonnegut or smoe icky noxema spokesperson
?
)
. usance tyhat plot isnt incredibly lame
annd a trackr recrod ofthe whta goes onthe wiht it wouldn ' t be able tothe cary a commerical let alone a feature film
,
adn becouse it ' s a party
, htere are soem omre main cahracters
, such as
: william
( charlie korsmo
, finaly surfacing aftter
" dick tracy
"
)
, yhe nerd
(
annd his dominions
) who hasnt cmo uv iwth a rediculous plan tothe publically sabotage mike
, who ' s humiliated him forthe yeras
,
bu gets too caught uv inspite drinking tothe dont it
; kenny
( seth gren
)
, tje wigger
, who hasnt desided thgat thsi party iwll be where he iwll fianlly git layed
( uh huh
)
;
adn denise
, teh onyl exeptional carachter
, who unforetunately gets sticked infront a bathroom
( don ' t ask
) witht kenny where tjhe twpo charactors let down theri charachters
anbd are alowed tothe followup tghe laws ofthe plot cliches fomr point a tothe point b iwth nary a bited ofthe characterization involved aftter awhile
. ugh
. tje main comparision htis film isnt getting tothe anohter film isnt atcually nto
" american grafitti
" or
" dazed
annd confuzled
,
" twpo films thyat embraced
annd ultimatly made humans outloud ofthe many ofthe its high schoolers
( nto tothe mention weere extremly intertaining
)
,
bu tothe john hughes films ofthe tyhe 80s
, most noteably
" sixteen candles
.
" tyhe big diference infront tjhe twpo isnt thgat tht film managed tothe nto onyl embrace
bu even satirize its main cahracters
,
annd doed so equally
adn iin an intertaining fashon
. thsi film forgets tothe satirize its charactors
,
anbd ultimatly tells a stopry baout a bunch ofthe uninteresting sterotypes
.
.
.
annd
thne sasy tath it ' s all okay
. we cin ' t tkae thsi film seriously
, nor cin we tkae tihs as funn
, so realy wqat ogod isnt it
?
bu i wiull tell yuo smoe thigns i doed liuke
: i liekd hte direction
, exept forthe a cuple too
- over
- tjhe
- top features
, liek way
- too
- glossy jump cuts
( it ' s liuke an oximoron
)
anbd otehr obscurities
. generaly
,
though
, elfont
adn kaplan dont hvae graeful camera movment
,
adn even manaze tothe capture an altman
- esque fiel tothe theri film ffrom tiem tothe tiome
( a thnig withthe a onot
,
though
, isnt too hokey tothe relaly be admirable
)
. i actualy doed liuke seth gren
, forthe once iin baout a decade
( wehn he palyed a vrey young woody allen inspite
" rdio dyas
"
)
- his desintegration ofthe his wigger carachter ws almsot believeable
.
.
. almsot
.
adn
, ofthe course
, lauren ambrose isnt wonderfull as denise
, tghe oney charcter we coudl hve utilizied soem moreso ofthe
, even
though it woudl haev changed tghe entirety ofthe tjhe film
.
howver
, tghe charachter ofthe denise realyl doesn ' t wokr wih teh film
, whn realyl throught baout
. she ' s far too witty
adn realized
( at least forthe yhe firt half
) tothe belong inwhich htis film
,
anbd whenever she appears
, she automaticly gives everthing a delightfully satrical tone
. she ' s nto jsut tje cynic or thte intelectual
; she ' s jstu a veyr intresting carachter who provides enteratinment even if it furuther damages otehr alread damaged cahracters
. she may ruin thge film omre
,
bu at least wehn she ' s onthe screen we cin sit uv
annd htink tothe ourselves
" well
, at least we ' ll be entertained
.
" a cuple otehr thigns tht jsut don ' t wokr
: mike ' s charater
, who suffers an epiphany thoughout tje film
bu inwhich tyhe end acts as
though he hasnt forgotten everyting
: too much tghe sacrifical lamb fo yhe film iin genaral
; thge aimless
, bitchy driving by preston tothe try
adn git over his inablility tothe shack uv wih amanda
- give me a break
;
adn perheaps tjhe oen thnig thgat jstu doesn ' t wrok at all
: jenna eflman ' s uncredited cameo as an ange
- jsut didn ' t wokr
,
bu nice try
. basicaly yhe worst hting baout tihs film
, hte rela reason i ' m giving thsi such a low rating
, isnt beacuse it refuses tothe give us any fully realized charachters
adn
thne insists we folow arund complet sterotypes fomr otehr movies doign thigns thgat are inane
anbd unlike anytying we ' d dont
. we don ' t efel forthe theese charactors beccause fo most ofthe us
, we aren ' t sterotypes gogin thru tjhe motions tothe worn subplots
. teh acid tust forthe high skool movies isnt
: doesnt it at all capture thte fiel ofthe waht it ' s portraing
? teh answer forthe thsi film isnt noone
. nice try
,
though
.
