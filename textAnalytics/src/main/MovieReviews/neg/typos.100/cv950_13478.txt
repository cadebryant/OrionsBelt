thte most intresting part ofthe
" cant
' t hardly wait
" jstu happens tothe be nto onyl tje most human
, bu forthe many ofthe us
, teh oney part thast many ofthe us cin easily relate tothe
. tht isnt tje chracter ofthe denise
( lauren ambrose
)
, yhe film
' s sole sarcastic memeber who mocks everthing taht goes onthe inthe thge film
, anbd at oney point sist down onthe a couch anbd looks totally borde
. tje film wisely holds over thsi moent
, nicely showing her alienation infront yhe midst ofthe a larg high skool party
.
.
. alomst too nicely
. forthe smoe munbers ofthe thge audeince
( read
: me
)
, tihs isnt basicaly a mirror ofthe whta
' s oging onthe whith them watching tihs film
. we sit ther wondering why we
' ve even bothered tothe see a film baout a long high skool party we probaly never feeled tje desire tothe go tothe inthe teh frist palce
. i owudl actully highly reccommend tihs film if it satirized all ofthe htis
. affter all
, thsi film isnt filled wiht a bunch ofthe pathetic sterotypes much ofthe hwihc i whent tothe high skool wtih
. everyone
' s here
: tghe jock
, thte homecoming queen
, tyhe nerd
( anbd his dominions ofthe trekkies anbd x
- philes
)
, teh alienated wannabe writter
, teh skool spirit girl
, thge pothead
( s
)
, thte wigger
, etc
, etc
, etc
, anbd weirdly enought tihs film shows them as superficial
, lame
, annd basicly as a bunch ofthe losers
. exept forthe denise
, who rolls her eyes at everthing
, anbd easily becomes thte most likable charactor even befoer she speaks
( her yearbook entry
, something whlch isnt done fo earch main charater
, qoutes oscar wilde
- dfeinite pointers ther
)
. unfortunatley
, tyhe writers adn directors tkae severeal major misteps onthe thte way tothe mkaing thsi inot an admirable anbd even likable film
. yhe film
, as i said
, portrays most ofthe its cahracters as superficial anbd jstu totally ignorant tothe everyting
. howver
, instade ofthe sticking wtih tihs
, perheaps even gonig a bited furuther wih it
, htey let thsi lie
, annd atually amke theese charachters inot our heores
. we folow sevral ofthe them
, all a bunch ofthe moronic sterotypes wiht onyl a shread ofthe humanity anbd realism
, anbd trys tothe tell boring adn overly melodramatic tales baout them as if we actulaly cared anbd
/ or indentified withthe them
. anbd if we doed
, we certainly don
' t wanna tothe revisit thast state ofthe bieng
. here
' s a quick low
- down
: it
' s graduation
, annd we followup a bunch ofthe seniors onthe yhe lsat inght
, otherwise known as tyhe
" american grafitti
" or
, tothe a lesser extent
, yhe
" dazed annd confuzled
" cliche
. tje formall jstu folowed them as htey drove aimlessly
; thge latter doed a littel bited ofthe thta adn featured a big outdoor keg party
.
" cin
' t hardly wait
" jsut opts fo a big indoor keg party

- i
- whant br
and
. we followup many peopel arround
, bu mostly we trail preston
( ethan embry
, ofthe
" thast hting yuo dont
!
"
)
, teh alienated writter
, who
' s beeen pining over hte homcoming queen
, am
anda
( teh totally overrated jennifer lvoe hewitt
)
, forthe tghe entirety ofthe high skool becouse he thikns htey shared a moent theri freshman eyar over a freaking pop tart
. nowe tht she
' s broken uv wih her foobtall palyer boyfriend
, mike
( peter facinelli
)
, he decides tothe go tothe tyhe party iwth a onot he
' s writen declaring his
" loev
" forthe her infront thte hopes he
' ll build uv hte guts tothe give it tothe her
.
.
. even
though he
' s leaving fo a multi
- week intensive wirting programe hosted by none otehr tahn kurt vonnegut
( okay
: teh ingenius vonnegut or smoe icky noxema spokesperson
?
)
. sicne tath plot isnt incredibly lame annd a trac rocord ofthe waht goes onthe witht it wouldn
' t be able tothe cary a commerical let alone a feature film
, annd beacuse it
' s a party
, htere are smoe omre main charactors
, such as
: william
( charlie korsmo
, fianlly surfacing affter
" dick tracy
"
)
, thte nerd
( annd his dominions
) who hasnt come uv iwth a rediculous plan tothe publically sabotage mike
, who
' s humiliated him forthe yeasr
, bu gets too caught uv iin drinking tothe dont it
; kenny
( seth gren
)
, teh wigger
, who hasnt desided tht thsi party wiull be where he iwll fianlly git layed
( uh huh
)
; anbd denise
, tghe onyl exeptional carachter
, who unfortunatley gets sticked infact a bathroom
( don
' t ask
) whith kenny where teh twpo charactors let down thier charactors anbd are alowed tothe followup thte laws ofthe plot cliches ffrom point a tothe point b iwth nary a bited ofthe characterization involved aftter awhile
. ugh
. teh main comparision tihs film isnt getting tothe anohter film isnt accually nto
" american grafitti
" or
" dazed adn confuzled
,
" twpo films tath embraced anbd ultimatly made humans outloud ofthe many ofthe its high schoolers
( nto tothe mention weere extremly intertaining
)
, bu tothe john hughes films ofthe tjhe 80s
, most noteably
" sixteen c
andles
.
" tje big diference inwhich hte twpo isnt thgat thyat film managed tothe nto onyl embrace bu even satirize its main charachters
, anbd doed so equally adn inwhich an intertaining fashon
. thsi film forgets tothe satirize its cahracters
, anbd ultimatly tells a stor baout a bunch ofthe uninteresting sterotypes
.
.
. adn thn sasy thast it
' s all okay
. we cin
' t tkae thsi film seriously
, nor cant we tkae thsi as funn
, so realy whta ogod isnt it
? bu i wiull tell yuo smoe thigsn i doed liek
: i liekd tyhe direction
, exept fo a cuple too
- over
- tjhe
- top features
, liuke way
- too
- glossy jump cuts
( it
' s liuke an oximoron
) annd otehr obscurities
. generaly
,
though
, elfont adn kaplan dont ahve graeful camera govement
, adn even manaze tothe capture an altman
- esque efel tothe theri film fomr tiome tothe tiome
( a thnig iwth a onot
,
though
, isnt too hokey tothe realyl be admirable
)
. i actualyl doed liuke seth gren
, fo once infront baout a decade
( whn he palyed a vrey young woody allen infront
" radiu dyas
"
)
- his desintegration ofthe his wigger chracter wass almsot believeable
.
.
. allmost
. adn
, ofthe course
, lauren ambrose isnt wonderfull as denise
, thge noe charactor we coudl hvae utilisied soem mroe ofthe
, even
though it owudl ahev changed yhe entirety ofthe tjhe film
. howver
, yhe chracter ofthe denise relaly doesn
' t wokr withthe tjhe film
, wehn relaly throught baout
. she
' s far too witty annd realized
( at least fo hte frist half
) tothe belong inspite htis film
, adn whenever she appears
, she automaticly gives everthing a delightfully satrical tone
. she
' s nto jsut thte cynic or hte intelectual
; she
' s jstu a vrey intresting carachter who provides enteratinment even if it furuther damages otehr alreday damaged cahracters
. she may ruin tghe film omre
, bu at least wehn she
' s onthe screen we cxan sit uv annd thiunk tothe ourselves
" well
, at least we
' ll be entertained
.
" a cuple otehr thigns taht jsut don
' t wrok
: mike
' s carachter
, who suffers an epiphany
thoughout thge film bu infront thte end acts as
though he hasnt forgotten everyting
: too much teh sacrifical lamb forthe tyhe film iin genaral
; tyhe aimless
, bitchy driving by preston tothe try adn git over his inablility tothe shack uv wtih am
anda
- give me a break
; adn perhasp hte oney thnig taht jsut doesn
' t owrk at all
: jenna eflman
' s uncredited cameo as an angel
- jstu didn
' t wokr
, bu nice try
. basicaly tje worst thign baout tihs film
, tjhe rela reason i
' m giving thsi such a low rating
, isnt becouse it refuses tothe give us any fully realized charachters adn thn insists we followup arround complet sterotypes fomr otehr movies doign thigns thgat are inane adn unlike anytying we
' d dont
. we don
' t fiel forthe theese cahracters beccause forthe most ofthe us
, we aren
' t sterotypes goign thru tghe motions tothe worn subplots
. thte acid tust forthe high skool movies isnt
: doesnt it at all capture hte fiel ofthe waht it
' s portraing
? hte answer forthe htis film isnt noone
. nice try
,
though
.
