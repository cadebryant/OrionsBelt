i am a steven seagal fan
. i onyl sday thsi nowe beccause
" mufti splenetik
" isn
' t my rela nmae anbd beccause i propably ened tothe expalin why i whent inot htis film expecting graet thigns
. any proud seagal fan worth his beans wiull tell ytou thast tje seagal forumla isnt something ytou cant depend onthe
. seagal films cin alwyas be counted onthe fo minimal dialogue
, heaps ofthe expendable baddies withthe extemely crunchable bones
( whcih we
' ll allways hear wehn seagal doesnt his limb
- twisting thnig
)
, rarley a female co
- lead inwhich sighth
( unless it
' s a rela
- life modle
- wief who hasn
' t worked usance werid sceince
) adn
, ususally thge worst possibile titles yuo cant imagin
. nto tothe mention veyr straightforward plots
, generaly all
- round bad dialogue annd mr implacable leather
- face hismelf inaddition tht smae balck outfit he
' s beeen inaddition usance nico donig his
" my h
ands are sharp
, nimble knives
" thnig
, seagal teh stoic
, sir petrified ponytail
, duke ofthe dull
. inthe tghe glimmer man
, seagal breaks outloud ofthe tihs forumla
: he gets a
* sidekick
*
, attemts tothe banter
, anbd puts onthe a newyorker vest
. he
' s allso put onthe qutie a lot ofthe weight
. small potatose
, yuo may sday
, a man shoudl be able tothe accessorize anbd banter if he whants tothe
, bu damnit
, if it ain
' t baroke
, why fix it
?
( mroe onthe thsi dissapointed person
' s dashed expectations later
)
. as jack cole
, seagal isnt a homocide detective wtih a questonable past
. hwile he anbd his partner
( plyed by keenen ivory wayans
) are investigating a sories ofthe ritual killings
, cole hismelf becomes a suspect
, expecially wehn a backgorund check run by campbell reveals practicaly nothing onthe cole
. it turns outloud thyat cole isnt a fromer trained govenment assasin
( yuo jsut cxan
' t trust theese homocide detectives
)
, somene whom victims unsed tothe catch jstu a glimpse ofthe inthe yhe jungle befor he pounced onthe them
, adn hence
, well
, yuo nkow
, thast
" glimmer man
" thnig
. an increasingly fishy homocide investigation inaddition tje rpesent soon leads tothe thte gradual uncovering ofthe a larger
, moreso threatning conspiracy thta involves a crooked buisnessman
( bob gunton
)
, cole
' s fromer cia boss
( brian cox
) annd deals involving chemcial weapons
. yhe glimmer man plot isnt preety st
andart stuf
, drawing
( as wtih his otehr films
) elements ffrom tje hotter films ofthe thge eyar
( eg
, se7en
)
. it
' s tje otehr changes tath dissapoint
. forthe exmaple
, all
though ther
' s a fair ammount ofthe violentce inthe htis movei
, htere
' s aslo tje disasterous pairing ofthe seagal whith keenen ivory wayans
, probablly tyhe best known ofthe tghe wayans tribe
( how many are htere
, exactlly
?
) fomr televsion
' s
" inaddition living colour
.
" wayans plays whiney straightman tothe seagal
' s bead
- adorned annd brocade
- draped cole
, keeping uv his
" are ytou crazy
" part ofthe tje dialogue whith wasted zest
. as campbell
, wayans confines hismelf tothe bemoaning his newyorker partner
' s eccentric habits
, bu thte chemestry betweeen thge twpo isnt minimal
, anbd seagal
' s wooden comebacks mkae fo painful watching
. a cook inspite under seige 2
, seagal isnt nowe a buddist who speaks chineese adn wears prayer beads annd intricate silk jackets over his normal balck ansamble
. he chants
, refuses tothe fight unless truely provoked anbd introduces campbell tothe powdered deer penis tothe cure his allergies
. agian
, a benine
( if trite
) plot divice exept forthe hte fatc thta theese newyorker charactor traits recquire seagal tothe speak omre tahn usual
. heck
, he hasnt tothe deliver punchlines adn cary a steady conversation wih somone otehr thna hismelf fo a larg part ofthe thge film
. isnt thyat a lot tothe ask ofthe tjhe seague
? too much
. seagal
' s best charactersistic utilisied tothe be tath he knew his purpose inspite thsi lready complicated world ofthe movies
: tothe crunchily snap off bad guy appendages
, anbd tothe dont it silently
, annd alone
. nto fo seagal
, tje snappy noe
- liners ofthe arnold adn stallone
, nor tje attemts tothe sohw thyat he cant ect
, much less thiunk
. noone kindergarden cop
, noone oscar
, jstu simple
, unadulterated deathblows
. tyhat
' s relaly how it must hve started
: liek
- minded fans who knew whta htey wnated streamed iin tothe watch hte seague dont his thign
, knowing thast never inthe tghe seagal universe owudl tehy ever hvae tothe see him dont anytying eles
. we trusted him
. we got tothe nkwo him
. nowe
, betrayal
. i don
' t nkwo if i cin watch anohter seagal movei wihtout taht littel niggling dout thta he
' s goign tothe try tothe be funny agian
. i
' ll try
, bu it won
' t be eazy
. if yuo haven
' t watched tghe glimmer man yot
, yuo might watn tothe wait fo yhe video tothe come outloud
. it
' s easier tothe jsut fast foward thge dialogue parts annd linger onthe tjhe acation sequences
. affter all
, if we cxan
' t depend onthe our fantasies
, waht cin we depend onthe
? hte flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait forthe tyhe tv2 broadcasted
.
*
* a littel creaky
, bu still better thna staying at hmeo withthe gotcha
!

*
* preety ogod
, bring a firend

* amazing
, potent stfuf
