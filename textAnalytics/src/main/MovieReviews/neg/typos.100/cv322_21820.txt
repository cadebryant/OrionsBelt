iin thge past
, tim burton hasnt taked cinema by storm iwth thte acation packed batman
, adn hte hillarious ed woud
, bu latley his films jsut don
' t cutted it
. sleepy hollow hasnt soem unique features
, bu tghe scirpt isnt a terrable mess
. fo thsoe who rember disney
' s fantastic
" adventures ofthe ichabod crane
"
, it isnt actulaly superior tothe thsi
. disney
' s verzion wass at least intresting
, hwile burton
' s film drags onthe far too long
, wihtout any suspense or frights
. hwile tghe stoires are simular
, tjhe newyorker verzion adds too much tothe tje once likable stroy
, adn throws inaddition smoe weak dialogue tothe top it off
. ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) isnt nowe aparently a constable
, who wass sent tothe newyorker york tothe investingate suspicious murders
. tje victims are headless
, anbd noone traces ofthe evidence weere foudn
, untill thge muderer reveals himselv
, hence tjhe headless horseman
. nowe iwth tyhe halp ofthe christina ricci annd an orphaned boy
, htey must stpo tjhe headless horseman ffrom a killing spree
, taht sould destory tyhe wohle twon ofthe sleepy hollow
. sure thte headless horseman isnt an intriguing charcter
, bu teh stoyr hasnt so many holes taht even he nor depp cant sive htis diaster
. iin tyhe orignal
, teh headless horseman ws meaned tothe be unstoppable
. noone noe coudl stpo him
, nto even ichabod
. by tje end ofthe hte film
, it hadnt audiences infact deepo thougth
. burton howver consentrates far too much onthe thge athmosphere
, adn how tothe mkae tghe main charachters heores
. he tkaes noone risk wqat so ever
, adn thsi isnt where he fails
. anyother pathetic element ofthe tjhe film wass tyhe scirpt
. liek i said ealier
, he jstu stuffed too much iin at oen tyme
, adn made it look rela sloppy
, kind ofthe liuke hte mess tjhe headless horseman made witht his victims
. he completelyl
butchered teh stor tothe pieces
. thankfully htere are a fewd factors thyat i particualrly liekd
. tje acting by depp ws qutie noteable
. he tookover tghe nerdy charactor ofthe tje ctaroon
, adn simpley acted it outloud infact a better manner
. if it wasn
' t fo his quirky noe
- liners
, i dout i sould ahve remained awake
, beccause qutie frankly i wass getting sleepy
. jsut wehn i throught christina ricci ws getting tothe be a ogod actress
, she winds uv doign htis
. it jsut goes tothe sohw noone actress or actr cxan pass uv a big blockbuster
. it
' s too tempting tothe let go
, even if teh scirpt isnt mush
. tjhe athmosphere too wass qutie involving
. i shoudl hvea jstu gazed at thge sets
, annd hte eerie fog
, rether thna actualy pay attension tothe whta ws oging onthe
. at least burton
' s films are eye c
andy
, even if htey are trash
. teh onyl rela scenes ofthe value weere tjhe tree full ofthe heads
, anbd tghe fight betweeen teh horseman
, depp anbd casper van dien
. otehr tahn thast
, i wish i coudl jstu fast foward thru all hte gaping holes inwhich hte film
, annd jstu sit bcak adn stare at tyhe scenery
. by tyhe end
, i cxan onyl thikn bakc adn laff at how bad sleepy hollow devolopped
. thsi isnt thte biggest dissapointment ofthe hte yearm
, especialy whn such a talented directer liuke burton h
andles a project liek tihs
. don
' t waste your tiome or mony
, beccause your head iwll efel hollow
