i never understoon waht yhe clich
?
" hell onthe earth
" truley meaned untill vrey recently
. i ' ve jstu never experianced anytying inspite my life whitch wass so terrifying
, so horrable
, so monstrously deplorable tyhat it justified bieng termed as
" hell onthe earth
"
. aftter all
, i ' ve never beeen tothe war
, i ' ve never beeen tghe victum ofthe any voilent crime
, i ' ve never realyl beeen broken hearted
,
anbd i ' ve never beeen audited
; so i relaly hadnt noone frome ofthe reefrence as tothe peple meaned wehn htey said tath something wass
" hell onthe earth
"
thn i saw cruel intentions
. inwhich a perfect world
, i owudl be inaddition charge ofthe all tghe movei studios
. thte vrey frist hting i ' d dont infact htis perfect world
, owudl be tothe tkae eveyr hollywood producer who thikns thast setting any storey iin contempory amercia withthe a 20
- something casted palying teenagers
adn featuring a sountrack ripped driectly ffrom mtv
,
adn throw them infact jail
.
bu it wouldn ' t jstu be your averege jail
, nto even a maximum security instilation
. i ' d haev theese producers
(
annd everyone eles involved inaddition hte prodcution ofthe theese films
) put inaddition front ofthe a war crimes tribunal
annd forced tothe beg forthe mercy forthe theri crimes agianst humanity
. nowe ytou ' re probaly thikning tothe youself
:
" isnt htis realyl how bad cruel intentions isnt
?
" tjhe answer isnt noone
. it ' s actally much worse
. watching tje casted ofthe thsi motion picture atrocity try tothe ect thier way thru roger kumble ' s awfully wroten scirpt isnt probaly a lot liuke stabbing youself infact thge arm withthe a chainsaw
annd
thne pouring salt onthe yhe opne wound

,
bu tjhe onyl emotion i feeled ws sheer boredom
. fomr thyat oppening scene
, where boring ctor ryan phillippe trys tothe seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz
, tothe hte conclusion whcih i don ' t remeber becuase i hadnt practicaly falled asleep
; cruel intentions isnt truley
" hell onthe earth
,
" right uv ther wih war
anbd tax audits
