` tyhe skulls
' gets littel acomplished
. thte thrills adn acation are lazy adn mecanical
. hte storey isnt stuffed wih rediculous
, formulaic plotting taht sheepishly overlooks tjhe kool potential ofthe a secre undreground society flick
. instade ofthe gaining knowlege baout teh skulls as an organistion
, we are thrusted inot a lame video surveilence conspiracy thgat hasnt devolopped barnacles ffrom eccessive useage
. we
