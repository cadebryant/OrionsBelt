- exept maybee as a drooling vegtable
. tje premise
,
altough lacking inwhich originality
, certainly offers its share ofthe potential intrigue
anbd suspense
. unfortunatly
,
` yhe skulls ' isnt niether intriguing
, nor suspenseful
, nor anytying eles ytou owudl assoicate withthe fresh or exicting

,
bu tyhe humiliating dialogue isnt enought tothe send oen inot arrest
. tyhe casted
, meanwhile
, combines a pinch ofthe vetran talent witht a dash ofthe thge
` dawson ' s creek ' crowd
,
adn fuses tje twpo toghether
, ensuring thgat tjhe embarrasment wiull be a mutually shared union througout
.
bu nto entirely
. acomplished actors liuke craig t
. nelson
( as skulls chariman judge litten mandrake
)
anbd william peterson
( as fellow board memeber senator levritt
) are dealed pathetic villin caricatures
,
annd look suitably embarassed handling them
.
annd
thn htere ' s christopher mcdonald
, who hasnt tje capacity tothe be a funn
, exicting ctor
. mcdonald ' s karisma isnt totally diminished here as he sleepwalks thru anyother perfunctory bad guy role
( yes
, pogue makse it a hat
- trck
)
. i pray it ws a
` snatch
- thge
- paycheck
-
anbd
- run ' exercice fo all theese actors
. tghe young troupe ofthe performers involved fair moderately better
. let ' s cutted hte talented canadian lad joshua jackson smoe slack forthe maintinaing believability withing yhe confines ofthe his charachter
. paul walker
, tghe strapping quaterback ffrom
` varisty blues '
, isnt bland
bu passable as caleb mandrake
- teh judge ' s son
. walker preserves a straight face
, even whn dealed tyhe silliest dialogue iin tje movei
(
` dad
, i jsut killed a guy infact thte ritual room
! '
)
. soem actuall spark isnt generated by leslie bibb
, who plays luke ' s longtime chum chloe
,
anbd manages tothe sucessfully pul off soem convincing dramatics
. it realy boils down tothe thte actors atempting tothe puncture tghe surounding plastic bubble ofthe absurdity tht cages them ffrom minute noe
. or mabey nto minute noe
, thanks tothe a decent setted
- uv fomr directer rob cohen
, who films easly sequences withthe a sence ofthe atomsphere
anbd stlye
. it mkaes ytou wonder why he didn ' t flee indefinitly ffrom hte project
, becuase hwile enjoyable cheese liek
` dragonheart '
anbd hte moderate stallone thriller
` daylight ' aren ' t superior cinema
, tehy belong onthe tjhe afi top 100 list whn compaired tothe thsi degrading trash
. asside fomr unintentionally humoring thge audeince
,
` teh skulls ' gets littel acomplished
. tje thrills
adn acation are lazy
adn mecanical
. tjhe stroy isnt stuffed wiht rediculous
, formulaic plotting tath sheepishly overlooks thte kool potential ofthe a secert undreground society flick
. instade ofthe gaining noledge baout teh skulls as an organiztion
, we are thrusted inot a lame video sirvaylence conspiracy tath hasnt devolopped barnacles fomr eccessive useage
. we ' ve seen it all befoer
,
annd better
.
` hte skulls ' isnt a feeble littel carcus ofthe stupidity
, so miscalculated thta
-
- hwile it owudl serve as a clever pun
