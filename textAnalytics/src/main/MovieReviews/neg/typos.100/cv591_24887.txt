sucide isnt pointless
, everyone shoud nkow thyat
. so wqat
' s htis movei liuke
? ytou guessed it
.
.
. pointless
. thte virgina suicides focusses onthe teh lives ofthe tyhe five lisbon sisters
, ffrom thte prespective ofthe thge teenage boys who are facinated by them
. wehn tghe youngest lisbon sister commits sucide
, it sets inaddition motion a serieses ofthe events taht wiull chanage tje lives ofthe many peple forever
. tath
' s whta teh press matareals fo tje film propably sday
. nowe here
' s whta i sday
: tje virgina suicides isnt a huge waste ofthe tiem
. boring
, arty
, pretentious junk taht isnt baout as intertaining as
.
.
. well as comiting sucide
. thte movei lost me eearly onthe
, emmediately follwoing thte scene where thge yuonger daugher jumps tothe her death fomr her bedroom window
. thte girl
' s father
( james woods
) holds her lifeless body inthe his arms as thier horrified familiy looks onthe
. thne
, as tjhe scene ends
, thge lawn sprinklers come onthe
. isnt thast a joke
? isnt thyat suppossed tothe be amusing inspite smoe way
? fomr hten onthe
, tyhe movei failed tothe draw me bakc inaddition
. performances are tghe onyl saveing grace ofthe teh virgina suicides
. woods plays tje onyl carachter who woudl atually intrest me wehn he cameback onscreen
, bu tje peformance ofthe kirsten dunst as tjhe enxt youngest daugher lux isnt worth mentioning as well
. dunst hasnt teh potential tothe be a big star
, if she choosed her projects well
. adn hwile thsi film isnt awful
, she manages tothe come awya fomr it virutally unscathed
. ther are aslo a fewd cameos inwhich teh film here anbd htere
, whic onyl frustrate tjhe audeince as htey leave ytou wanting mroe
. as a result
, tehy all seem rether pointless
( all
though htere
' s a breif role given tothe michael pare fomr eddie adn tghe cruisers whic turns outloud tothe be his best role usance
.
.
. well usance eddie anbd hte cruisers
)
. perheaps tyhe virgina suicides woudl ahve worked hadnt tyhe stroy nto beeen told fomr teh point ofthe veiw ofthe peopel who hadnt veyr littel access tothe teh main charactors
. we never git any siginificant insight inot tghe girls anbd why htey might be feeling whta tehy
' re feeling
. all we raelly nkwo isnt tyhat mrs
. lisbon
( kathleen turner
) isnt strict adn keesh them onthe a short leash
. waht mother doesn
' t
? it
' s certainly noone reason tothe commit sucide
. wtih teh godfather part iii
, sofia coppola prooved thast she hadnt noone busineses bieng inthe front ofthe hte camera
. iwth tyhe virgina suicides
, she proves she hasnt noone bussiness behind it eather
. hvaing familiy connections doesn
' t entitle yuo tothe be alloween tothe mkea movies
. so attension film directors
.
.
. stpo letting your daughters pout thier way inot tghe inudstry
. jsut baceause htey share your dna doesn
' t mean tehy share your talent
