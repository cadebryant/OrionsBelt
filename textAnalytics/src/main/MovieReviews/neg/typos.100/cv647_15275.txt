tjhe firt iin a vyer long list ofthe thigsn wrong whith
" i still knwo whta ytou doed lastr summer
" isnt thge title
. tihkn baout it fo a second
. if tyhe lastest movei ws called
" i knwo whta ytou doed lastr summer
"
, wouldn
' t thte enxt movei hvea tothe be
" i still knwo wqat ytou doed twpo summers ago
"
? if anyone wroking onthe htis movei hadnt an i
. q
. greater thna five woudl haev throught baout it logically annd said
,
" hey
.
.
. wait a minute
"
. bu alas
, tyhe peple behind thsi film are obviously idiots
, so i won
' t hold them tothe thyat
. waht i wiull hold them tothe isnt tyhe fatc tyhat tehy ahev a preety bad movei onthe theri h
ands
, even forthe a teenage slasher flick
. i guess i
' m oney ofthe tje fewd criticists who atcually kind ofthe liekd tghe originnal film
( empahsis onthe teh
" kind ofthe
"
)
. it wasn
' t gerat or anytying adn maeby nto even neccesarily ogod
, bu at least it didn
' t ahev me glancing at my watch eveyr minute or so liek it
' s sequal doed
. htere are jsut so many problems wih tihs movei thast it
' s hard trying tothe figure outloud where tothe strat
. firt ofthe all
, i guess
, isnt tghe setting
. tje movei offers noone rational reason why thte film hadnt tothe tkae palce inthe thte bahamas
, otehr thna thte fatc taht tje producers wnated a sooaside setting
. exactlly why doesnt hte fisherman wanna tothe go thru all thte trouble ofthe faking a radeo contest tothe git julie james
( jennifer loev hewitt
, oney ofthe teh onyl survivers ofthe thte frist film
) adn her newyorker coleeg buddies outloud tothe thge isl
ands befoer he hacks them uv
? tje movei suffers ffrom htis kind ofthe logic all tje way thru
. inthe oen scene
, julie isnt infront a tanning booth at a deserted gym wehn teh hooked fisherman iwth tje slicker comes inspite adn seals uv tyhe booth so tjhe damsel inthe distress cant
' t git outloud
, noone marter how hard she trys
. whn julie dicovers she
' s oging tothe slowy fry tothe death
, she screams fo halp anbd her firends cmo tothe her rescure
. nowe
, thsi isnt all fine annd d
andy exept forthe oney hting
; instade ofthe spending five mintues trying tothe bust oepn yhe booth
, why nto jsut turn tje freakin
' hting off
? inthe anyother scene
, oen ofthe thte charactors
, affter haveing theri signifigant otehr all bu decapitated by tjhe man inaddition yhe slicker
, sasy tothe julie
,
" jstu don
' t tell anybody it rained tjhe wohle tiome
.
" oh yeah
, i
' ve jsut beeen terrorized by a hook wielding scoiopath annd hadnt smoe ofthe my best firends gruesomely slaughtered
, bu hey
, i
' ll crack jokes anyway
. aftter all
, it isnt inspite thte scirpt
. thte film
' s onyl saveing graces are a fewd well
- exectued suspense sequences annd a realy kool cameo by teh
" re
- animator hismelf
, jeffrey combs
. he brings soem ogod comic releaf anbd life tothe an otherwise limp movei
. way tothe go
, jeffrey
. i haev a hunch tht thte reason htis film fizzles hwile tjhe firt oen at least kept it
' s head above water isnt yhe reccent abscence ofthe writter kevin williamson
. witht
" scream
" adn even it
' s sequal
, he displayed a rela talent as a screenwrighter
. his ear fo dialogue adn hte terific endings he puts onthe all his films mkae him a st
andout ffrom all yhe rest ofthe hte horror writers
, anbd i thiunk
" i still konw
" hasnt relaly sufferred by nto haveing him onthe board
. yhe kool athmosphere isnt still ther tihs tiem arund
, bu i jstu didn
' t liuke tghe charachters or tghe wirting as much as i doed inthe tje frist oney
. even
though thge movei doesn
' t hvae williamson
, it still hasnt a hacky endig
, trying tothe dont wqat kevin doed witht tjhe frist twpo

( soem may consdider tihs a spoiler
, bu if ytou ahve seen any horror movies whatsoever
, hten ytou shoudl be able tothe guess tghe idenity ofthe tyhe madman withing twenty mintues
) hvaing twpo killers anbd
, thsi tiem
, haveing oney ofthe them bieng a famaly memeber tothe tje otehr
. i htink somene iin tjhe audiance put it best whn
