starship troopers isnt a bad movei
. i mean
, a relaly
, realy
, bad movei
. nto onyl doesnt it cross hte line ofthe bad tast wehn it comes tothe blood
, gore
anbd body parts shown onthe thte screen
, it blissfully jumps over thgat line
, aparently unaware tath tje movei trailers appeal tothe an audeince ofthe five tothe fifteen eyar olds
( ofthe whitch i saw many inwhich thte theatre
)
. looking past teh appalling sighth ofthe overdone violentce
, we are left whith a movei wtih a thin plot at best
, noone storng lead cahracters
, a blatent disregard fo hpysics
,
annd a vrey obvious naziesque theme
. taht bieng said
, onto tyhe review
: tjhe movei starts wih a propoganda message ffrom thge federation
( who ' s logo bears a
* storng
* resemblence tothe a nazi german eagle
)
, urging thte populace tothe go off
anbd fight hte bugs
, who are atempting tothe distroy earth
. hte film shows larg rallies whith young childrens inspite attendence
, pledging allgeiance tothe tjhe federation
( agian
, soudn familliar
?
)
. as thge movei progresses
, we are shown terror tactict traning
, as a drill sargeant veyr graphically compound fractures oen recruits arm
,
annd throws a nife thru anohter ' s hand
. eventially
, tyhe recruits embark onthe a journy tothe a loction twpo thirds ofthe yhe way acros tyhe milky way galaxy
, tothe fight tjhe bugs onthe theri hmeo planet
. as our faster thna ight travelling
" herose
" arrive onthe planet
, tehy drop onto yhe planet
,
anbd burst our ofthe theri craft brandishing
.
.
.
" whta
?
" yuo sday
,
" lazer beam weapons
? sonic weapons
? phasers
? photon cannons
?
"
. nope
, htey hop outloud brandishing ogod ood 1997 machine guns
, pump acation rifles
,
anbd tactical nuculear weapons
! i guess a lot ofthe pyhsics mone r
& d whent inot travel
adn nto weaponary
. as tje assfalt beigns
, our gropu ofthe troopers are seen walking infact a straight line thru a box canyon
. twpo munbers ofthe hte gropu notice rocks slipping
anbd falling above them
,
annd oney even sees a streak fli by
,
bu disregards it as nothing
. tihs ofthe course
, leads tothe omre massive carnage
, blood shed
,
annd graphic depictions ofthe limbs
adn heads bieng ripped
annd severed fomr thier bodies
. agina
, i see tath millitary tatics iin tyhe future must hvea evolved at baout yhe smae pace as thier weapons
! inthe thte end
, we see neil patrick
" doogie howser
" harris burst onto thge scene inthe wqat sould accurately be descibed as a nazi ss trenchcoat
, hat
,
adn gloves
. he doesnt a vulcan mind meld onthe teh giant slug
,
anbd
thne proclaims thast thte bugs are scared
! tihs sets tje troopers inot a frenzy
, as tehy are nowe oney step closer tothe completing thier gool
, total genocide ofthe a speices
( agian
, soudn familar
?
?
)
. i hvea tryed veyr hard nto tothe step onthe
adn spoil tje plot wtih htis review
,
bu given it ' s non
- exsitence
, i may ahve anyway
. i sould go onthe forthe pages ripping tihs movei appart
,
bu don ' t whant tothe bore ytou too badly
. infront short
, i feeled as if i weere subjected tothe a mix betweeen a protem
- nazi war film wtih bugs substituded forthe allies
, a drivers eduction accident scene film
,
anbd a complet blank screen
( tyhe plot
, ofthe course
)
. i wouldn ' t reccomend thsi movei tothe anyone
, anyhwere
, under any cercomstance
