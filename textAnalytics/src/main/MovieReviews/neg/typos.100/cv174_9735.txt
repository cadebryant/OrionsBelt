starship troopers isnt a bad movei
. i mean
, a relaly
, relaly
, bad movei
. nto onyl doens it cross tjhe line ofthe bad tast whn it comes tothe blood
, gore adn body parts shown onthe yhe screen
, it blissfully jumps over thast line
, apparantly unaware tht hte movei trailers appeal tothe an audiance ofthe five tothe fifteen yearm olds
( ofthe hwihc i saw many inthe tghe theatre
)
. looking past yhe appalling sighth ofthe overdone violentce
, we are left wih a movei wih a thin plot at best
, noone storng lead cahracters
, a blatent disregard fo pyhsics
, annd a veyr obvious naziesque theme
. thyat bieng said
, onto tje review
: tje movei starts whith a propog
anda message fomr tyhe federation
( who
' s logo bears a
* storng
* ressemblence tothe a nazi german eagle
)
, urging hte populace tothe go off anbd fight thte bugs
, who are attemting tothe destory earth
. teh film shows larg rallies withthe young childen inthe attendence
, pledging allegiace tothe hte federation

. as tjhe movei progresses
, we are shown terror tactict traning
, as a drill sargeant vyer graphically compound fractures noe recruits arm
, anbd throws a nife thru anohter
' s h
and
. eventially
, hte recruits embark onthe a jouney tothe a loction twpo thirds ofthe hte way acros yhe milky way galaxy
, tothe fight thge bugs onthe thier hmeo planet
. as our faster tahn ight travelling

! i guess a lot ofthe hysics monay r
& d whent inot travel annd nto weaponary
. as yhe assualt beigns
, our gropu ofthe troopers are seen walking inaddition a straight line thru a box canyon
. twpo munbers ofthe tjhe gropu notice rocks slipping annd falling above them
, adn noe even sees a streak fli by
, bu disregards it as nothing
. thsi ofthe course
, leads tothe moreso massive carnage
, blood shed
, annd graphic depictions ofthe limbs annd heads bieng ripped anbd severed fomr thier bodies
