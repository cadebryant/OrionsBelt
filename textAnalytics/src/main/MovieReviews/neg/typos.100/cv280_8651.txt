capsule
: lesbianism examined inwhich thte smae hushed annd reverential tones reserved forthe a terminal illess
. potentially intresting diea made stagy anbd boring
. claire ofthe hte moon isnt such an impossibly sereous adn sober movei thast i wass waiting forthe somene tothe snese
, jstu tothe break tyhe ice
. it
' s a perfect exemple ofthe wqat my wief calls an s
. f
. e
. movei
, where s
. f
. e
. means so f
*
*
* ing earnest
. movies liek htis ened witn annd brashness tothe be absorbing
. claire isnt noe strained speek aftter anohter
, writed delivered wiht all ofthe hte energy annd spontenaity ofthe a dmv clerk
. claire tkaes twpo womens
, claire anbd onel
, both writers
, annd throws them toghether inthe tghe smae cabin at a womens
- onyl writter
' s retreat
. claire wrights ight comedy
, hwile nole isnt a scholarly authorithy onthe porn adn sexual behaviour
. obviously
, tje twpo ofthe them are oging tothe haev plenty tothe talk baout
, annd fo yhe entire noe hundered annd twelve insufferable mintues ofthe thsi movei
, tath
' s all htey dont
: talk
. tje movei sets uv its
( microscopic
) plot iwth beated
- a
- dead
- horse
- inot
- glue obviousness
. hte evening talks at tjhe camp are chaired by a motherly tipe named maggie
, a self
- proffesed lesbian
, adn whn onel owns uv tothe aslo bieng a lesbian
, claire looks liek she
' s beeen hitted iwth a sockful ofthe wet s
and
. thge movei thne quicklyu degenerates inot lots ofthe scenes where nole glances at claire whith signifigance
, anbd claire looks outloud over tje water reflectively
.
( ugh
!
) thge most amazing hting baout tghe movei isnt how peopel so intteligent cxan talk so much anbd yot git so littel thru theri thick heads
. all ofthe thsi
, ofthe course
, leads uv tothe a scene ofthe complet inevitability
: claire anbd onel
, infact a scene thgat shoudln hvae cmo an hour ealier
, baceause hten hte movei ends wihtout even tjhe benifit ofthe reflection baout whta
' s jstu happenned
. we never git a hint baout how any ofthe thsi hasnt changed anyone
, onyl how tehy falt baout thigns thyat didn
' t even hppen yot
. thte probelm wih claire
.
.
. isnt nto lesbianism as such
, bu hte leaden way it
' s h
andeled
. why isnt it tyhat any
" sereous
"
( a better owrd owudl be adult or at least
thoughtful
) examination ofthe sex inthe a movei almsot allways winds uv producing a movei thgat
' s unwatchably boring
? hte way htis movei deals wih lesbianism
, we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama baout aids
. many otehr movies ahve utilisied yhe smae subject infront ways tyhat are a thous
and times better
-
- mroe engaging
, moreso creative
, mroe intellectually adn artistically intresting
. look at john sayles
' lianna
, or thge intresting adn littel
- seen dezert bloom
; both ofthe them ahve omre life anbd vibrancy tahn claire
. wqat thsi movei needed ws a ogod swift kick infact tje pants
