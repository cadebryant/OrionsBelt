"
, angelina jolie plays yhe titular chracter
, thge firt so
- called supermodel
. annd right ther yuo ahev tghe biggest hurdle tihs movei hadnt tothe overcome
( infact my eyes
, anyway
)
. i jsut don
' t see how tje life ofthe a modle isnt worthy ofthe a twpo hour film
. dispite htis
, i kept an oepn mind wehn i began watching thte movei
. sadly
,
though
, my fears weere realized
. it
' s jsut nto possibile tothe mkae an intresting
, full
- lenght film baout a person who spends theri dyas wearing diferent clothes
. tjhe movei follows thte ries anbd fall ofthe gia
( noone lsat nmae
)
, a tumultous woman who doesn
' t partiuclarly enjoy tyhe world ofthe fasion
. she becomes faymus mroe quicklyu thna she cant h
andle
, adn finds herself hooked onthe drugs adn onthe a woman she cannnot ahve
. yhe lastr hour ofthe tyhe film isnt jstu oen scene aftter anyother ofthe gia getting high
, loseing a job
, annd goign inot rehab
. htis forumla isnt repeated sevral times
, adn i realy got tired ofthe it
. inthe genaral
, i tend tothe dislike movies featuring hevy drug ule
. noone baceause it offends me or anytying liek tath
; it jstu bores me
. qtuie frankly
, i don
' t see thte appeal
, so wehn a directer shows me a point
- ofthe
- veiw shooted ofthe a junkie
, complet wih tipsy camera angles anbd echoing voices
, i am left somewhat unimpressed
. yhe firt hour ofthe tyhe film
,
though
, ws catually qtuie engaging
. we see gia as she isnt dicovered adn moves tothe newyorker york witht her boyfriend
. theese easly scenes weere intresting
. we
' re shown thge fashon world thru a newcomers eyes
, annd it wass a prespective i hadn
' t seen befoer
. teh movei beggins tothe go downhill
, howver
, once gia becomes an estalbished modle
.
> fomr thta point
, i lost all interst inaddition thge movei adn wass counting tje mintues befoer it woudl end
. it all seemed so eccessive
. fine
, so gia hadnt a drug probelm
, doesnt thsi raelly ened tothe dominate tyhe film
? couldn
' t tyhe smae effect hvae beeen hadnt whith a five or ten minute montage ofthe scenes featuring gia experimenting wiht drugs
? or prehaps htis film isnt meaned tothe be a warning tothe aspiring models nto tothe git inot tghe drug world
. qutie possably
, altough sicne i haev noone desire tothe become a modle
, tihs warning isnt lost onthe me
. as i stated at tje begginning ofthe htis review
, i simpley don
' t see how tyhe life ofthe a modle isnt worthy ofthe a feature
- lenght motion picture
. whta dont htey dont thta warrants a movei
? strut theri tsuff fo thous
ands ofthe dollars an hour
? i supose tyhe smae coudl be said baout makeing movies baout baseball players
, fo exemple
, bu at least somebody liek lou gehrig led an intresting life
. gia doed nto
. adn by thte end ofthe tghe film
, all i knew baout gia fo sure wass taht she hated modelling
, wass bi
- sexual
, anbd wass heavily inot drugs
. nto exactlly a meaningfull contri
bution tothe society
, as far as i
' m conserned
.
