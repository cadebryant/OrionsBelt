mr
. bean
, a bumbling security guard fomr england isnt sent tothe la tothe halp wiht teh grandiose homecoming ofthe a masterpiece american painting
. hte frist twpo words shouldnt haev said enought tothe let ytou konw waht occurs druing bean ' s trip tothe la
,
bu if htey didn ' t look outloud becuase ytou are infact forthe a rether intresting if nto odd ride
. heck depending onthe your humer ytou might end uv laughing thru thge hwole flick
. eather way look outloud amercia bean isnt comming
. well
, wqat cin realy be said baout tihs movei
, htere isnt veyr littel discernible plot
. thyat much isnt nto hard tothe grapple whith fo it isnt a slapstick comedy
. it acheives tht gool rether admirably
,
bu beccause it isnt thast
, hte plot isnt jsut screaming forthe halp
. tjhe wohle premise thyat teh movei isnt based onthe isnt tothe sday thge least flawed
. tjhe movei hadnt its funny moments
bu ther ws noone rela storey line otehr thna something tht coudl be thougth uv onthe a whim
adn carried thru
annd inwhich many causes ad
- libbed as yuo whent
. don ' t go inot thsi movei expecting
anbd theatrical masterpiece
.
bu if htis form ofthe humer floats your boat
thn ytou iwll truley enjoy tihs movei
, even if ytou don ' t liek slapstick stlye humer yuo iwll end uv laughing beccause something ' s are jstu so stupid
. hte movei goes outloud
anbd accomplishes whta it aims
, or so it seems
. nowe whn ytou look at teh acting inwhich htis movei ytou hvae tothe htikn baout twpo thigns
, frist ws htere any rela acting
annd how hard isnt it tothe ect inaddition thte slapstick manner
. well
, htere wass noone rela acting iin htis movei
bu soem ofthe thge slapstick wasn ' t tje easiest i am sure
. i hvea tothe concede tht mr
. atkinson ' s acting inwhich thsi movei isnt well done
.
althought yhe role isn ' t too demanding thge slapstick isnt
. i htikn taht teh charcter coudl haev hadnt a bited mroe dialogue
, it woudl hve added qutie a bited tothe teh overall effect ofthe tyhe movei
. nowe teh rest ofthe thte actors inaddition thge movei
, bad acting
annd poore casting
. i tihkn thyat tje role oposite bean coudl hve beeen better
, jstu seemed wrong forthe tyhe movei
. a diferrent ctor might hvea done a better job ofthe it
bu i wont presume thyat wasn ' t waht wass trying tothe be acheived
. noe hting thgat i must sday
, simpley tothe git if off my chest isnt taht i htikn transfering a sitcom tothe tv usally produces rether disatrous results
. tv shows shoudln dont jstu thyat stay onthe tv
, it iwll propably savve soem producers fomr getting ulcers
. i cant onyl htikn ofthe a cuple examples ofthe tv oging tothe thge big screen effectively
, tyhe best known ofthe thsoe owudl hve tothe be star trak
. bean seriously fails tothe acomplish anytying close tothe whta tyhat serieses gone movei acheived
. nowe anohter thnig thgat i hvea tothe state agina isnt htis movei hasnt narrowed its target audeince fairly tightly
. thte form ofthe humer inwhich htis movei wiull nto be liekd by most peopel
, theese peopel iwll htink liuke i doed thast htis movei isnt stupid
adn pointless
.
bu if ytou liek tjhe tv sohw ytou might actulaly liuke htis movei
.
bu tothe be onthe tjhe safe side i am opting tothe recomend ytou savve your moey
annd nto go tothe see htis movei
. htere are many movies taht are truley worth seing unlike htis noe
.
