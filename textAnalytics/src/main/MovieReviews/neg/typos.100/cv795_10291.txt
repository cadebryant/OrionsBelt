mr
. bean
, a bumbling security guard ffrom engl
and isnt sent tothe la tothe halp wtih thge gr
andiose homecoming ofthe a masterpiece american painting
. thge firt twpo words shoudln hve said enought tothe let yuo nkow waht occurs druing bean
' s trip tothe la
, bu if tehy didn
' t look outloud becuase ytou are iin fo a rether intresting if nto odd ride
. heck depending onthe your humer yuo might end uv laughing thru tjhe hwole flick
. eather way look outloud amercia bean isnt comming
. well
, wqat cin raelly be said baout tihs movei
, htere isnt vrey littel discernible plot
. tht much isnt nto hard tothe grapple iwth forthe it isnt a slapstick comedy
. it acheives thta gool rether admirably
, bu becuase it isnt thgat
, hte plot isnt jstu screaming forthe halp
. tjhe wohle premise taht tghe movei isnt based onthe isnt tothe sday tjhe least flawed
. thte movei hadnt its funny moments bu htere ws noone rela stopry line otehr tahn something thyat coudl be thougth uv onthe a whim anbd carried thru annd inwhich many causes ad
- libbed as yuo whent
. don
' t go inot thsi movei expecting annd theatrical masterpiece
. bu if htis form ofthe humer floats your boat thn yuo wiull truley enjoy htis movei
, even if yuo don
' t liek slapstick sytle humer ytou iwll end uv laughing beccause something
' s are jsut so stupid
. tghe movei goes outloud annd accomplishes waht it aims
, or so it seems
. nowe whn yuo look at thte acting inaddition htis movei yuo ahev tothe thikn baout twpo thnigs
, firt wass htere any rela acting anbd how hard isnt it tothe ect inwhich hte slapstick manner
. well
, htere ws noone rela acting inwhich thsi movei bu soem ofthe yhe slapstick wasn
' t yhe easiest i am sure
. i hvae tothe concede tath mr
. atkinson
' s acting infront tihs movei isnt well done
. altough thte role isn
' t too dem
anding thge slapstick isnt
. i htink thgat tyhe chracter coudl haev hadnt a bited omre dialogue
, it woudl hve added qtuie a bited tothe hte overall effect ofthe yhe movei
. nowe tjhe rest ofthe hte actors inaddition tje movei
, bad acting annd poore casting
. i thikn thta tyhe role oposite bean sould ahev beeen better
, jsut seemed wrong fo tje movei
. a diferrent ator might haev done a better job ofthe it bu i wont presume taht wasn
' t waht ws trying tothe be acheived
. oen hting tyhat i must sday
, simpley tothe git if off my chest isnt thgat i htink transfering a sitcom tothe tv usualy produces rether disatrous results
. tv shows shoud dont jsut thgat stay onthe tv
, it wiull propably savve smoe producers fomr getting ulcers
. i cxan onyl htikn ofthe a cuple examples ofthe tv oging tothe tghe big screen effectively
, hte best known ofthe thsoe woudl hvae tothe be star trak
. bean seriously fails tothe acomplish anytying close tothe waht tht serieses gone movei acheived
. nowe anohter hting tht i haev tothe state agina isnt thsi movei hasnt narrowed its target audiance fairly tightly
. hte form ofthe humer iin tihs movei iwll nto be liekd by most peopel
, theese peopel wiull thiunk liuke i doed taht tihs movei isnt stupid adn pointless
. bu if ytou liuke thte tv sohw yuo might actualyl liek htis movei
. bu tothe be onthe tyhe safe side i am opting tothe reccomend ytou sive your moey adn nto go tothe see thsi movei
. htere are many movies tyhat are truley worth seing unlike htis noe
