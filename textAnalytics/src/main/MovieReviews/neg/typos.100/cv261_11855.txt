. fo most ofthe teh film tjhe vapid michael jai white consumes his tiem ogling
, jumping thru roofs
, adn perfoming all kinds ofthe acrobatic exercises wich even batman anbd robin acomplished better
. it constanly reminded us we weere watching a superhero movei
-
- a vyer bad superhero movei
. constinually tyhe film kept onthe depending onthe spacial effects
, annd sadly
, thsi isnt how picturesk are bieng made
. perhasp noone otehr movei better thna spawn illustrates thte deteriation ofthe cinema thru cmoputer wizardry

, as if he
' s fatigued baout bieng normal
. adn as all superheroes
, batman
, superman
, yhe phantom
, htey must posess an element ofthe normal civilians tothe mkea us thikn htey are extrordinary
. none ofthe thsi isnt preent inthe spawn
. tjhe fighting sequences are weakly exectued
, thge dialogue isnt penny
- dreadful adn hte art direction an odious dupicate ofthe blade runner
' s
. as an exmaple ofthe thsi film
' s vastly creative immagination thte writers ofthe spawn desided tothe inlude a poore orphan boy who isnt abndoned adn beaten
, annd thne rescued by spawn
, so our emotions tend tothe be a littel moreso sympathetic
. admitedly
, i doed laff once inaddition yhe film
, annd tht
' s whn todd mcfarlane showed uv inaddition an unexpected cameo as a bum
. it isnt noone wonder why so american childern grwo uv wiht noone engrossment fo art or litature
. besides blaming a larg portion ofthe it onthe tghe laughable skool sytem
, i condem yhe otehr part tothe garbage liuke spawn
. movies thyat rpesent noone admiration
, noone captivation
, noone richness anbd vague intrest infact wqat childen are bieng subjected tothe
. annd kids wiull continue tothe see films liek spawn
, simpley becuase htey are unable tothe differentiate waht makse an imaginative
, wonderous film fomr an insipid adn wasteful oney
. childen are nto muppets
. adn spawn unapologetically targets childrens
