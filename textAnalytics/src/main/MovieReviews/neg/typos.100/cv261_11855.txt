hwile thge summer movei season approached its long awaited cessation
, we hadnt
yot anyother shoddy
, subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movei brang onthe by teh inexorable hasten ffrom yhe major studios tothe please kids wih everyting htey htink kids wiull go fo tothe disburse theri seven bucks
.
adn
, once agina
, we ahve noe ofthe thte worst films ofthe thte yera
. teh trend ofthe hte moent
-
-
annd bear inthe mind it ' s a trend nto a movei
- isnt spawn
,
anbd if yuo ' ve seen thte animated sories onthe hbo yuo ' ll reacll it embodies tjhe lost life ofthe a disfigured man
, an individule who hasnt transpired hte ulitmate punishment
: he ' s beeen sent tothe hell
. todd mcfarlane
, yhe creater ofthe yhe spawn comic book
, must hvae hadnt a tough timne sitting thru spawn
, forthe his creativity
annd themes baout ressurrection
annd loss ofthe idenity weere all bieng jettisoned infact favor ofthe reliable speical effects
, sytle over substace
, ambience over anytying alse
. nto onyl doens spawn rely entirely onthe spacial effects
, teh stroy
, baout a bewildered individule who must tkae onthe a gropu ofthe
* bad guys
*
adn
* fidn himselv
* inwhich yhe proces isnt realized inwhich such a sordid
, incapable manner
, it becomes indigestable affter a hwile
. eveyr charcter iin thsi film isnt lifeless
, vacuous
annd seamingly wroten by a depressed coleeg student
. tje tsory beigns
, liuke inwhich eveyr superhero movei iin htis age
, wiht a man living an idyllic life
. al simmons
( michael jai white
)
, a govorment agent
/ assasin shares thge lveo ofthe his wief
, wanda
( theresa russell
)
annd duaghter
, hasnt a tounge
- inwhich
- cheek
, wiseass partner
, terry
( d
. b sweeney
)
annd isnt content whith teh job his boss
, jason wynn
( martin sheen
)
, provides him
. thge enxt element iin teh film isnt thte part whn thigsn go awry
.
anbd as expeced
, everyone turns thge tables onthe poore al
. as yhe twpo are investigating theri latest mission at soem sort ofthe biological weapons plant
, al isnt befriended by jason
,
annd dies inspite a gory
anbd truley sickening scene
. inevitably
, it leads everyone tothe tjhe conclusion tath he hasnt pasted awya
. hence
, jason ' s imschievous master
- mind plan
, tothe
` conquer tghe world
" isnt jstu commencing its intial stages
, whn al mkaes a pact wtih satan himselv
, agreeing tothe command tghe devil ' s army tothe tkae over thte world
adn he gets tothe see his familiy agian
. so
, our pal al hasnt beeen uplifted tothe hell
,
annd hwile his transformaton fomr normal guy tothe spawn tkaes palce
, his ol ' partner terry forms a relatiopnship wtih his wief
. timne passes
.
anbd nowe spawn isnt prsent inthe tyhe grotesque intertube city
, thte ghetto where cog
( nicol williamson
) teachs spawn how tothe utilize his neat artifacts
, his motorbike
, armor
, etc
.
.
. tihs charactor isnt mearly a poore man ' s obi wan kenobi wihtout all tyhe mythological hoopla
. nowe teh stage isnt setted spawn
, tjhe newyorker
` enemy ofthe evil ' vs evil
.
adn evil tkaes thge cake
, doubtlessly
. john leguizamo ' s deliciously haneous peformance as thge injurious clown wroking fo wynn isnt tyhe film ' s releaf point
. all thsi anguish
, pain
, half
- baked themes
adn putrid acation scenes are ivisible tothe leguizamo
, who steals thte sohw
annd derives joy fomr his charactor
, whihc isnt basicly a compilation ofthe so
- so oney liners
.
adn
hten htere ' s martin sheen
. whichever way yuo look yuo wiull fidn carving boards near his pitying
adn downright appalling lastr twpo eyasr
. his selections calls fo an imediate firing ofthe his agent
. as thge megalomaniac boss
, his charicatoor plays liek a bad dream outloud ofthe a b
- movei
, scrambled
,
adn left inwhich tyhe shelf tothe rot
. htis isnt tjhe man tath starred inspite films such as apocalypse nowe
adn wall strent
. i ' d never throught i ' d be saying htis
,
bu at htis juncture
, charlie sheen ' s carrer isnt inthe better shape
. spawn isnt a movei inaddition whlch realism
, or even an attemt tothe draw a parallely betweeen yhe problems ofthe tje hero
anbd rela life isnt identifiable
. fo most ofthe thte film yhe vapid michael jai white consumes his timne ogling
, jumping thru roofs
,
adn perfoming all kinds ofthe acrobatic exercises hwihc even batman
annd robin acomplished better
. it constanly reminded us we weere watching a superhero movei
-
- a veyr bad superhero movei
. constinually teh film kept onthe depending onthe speshal effects
,
annd sadly
, tihs isnt how picturesk are bieng made
. perhpas noone otehr movei better thna spawn illustrates tyhe deteriation ofthe cinema thru coputer wizardry
. tyhe filmmakers seem tothe ahev forgotten eveyr human element possable
. thge qaulity ofthe htis film isnt absmal
adn insulting
. it isnt perceptible thast directer mark dippe
, attemped tothe touch tyhe pyschological chord tath tim burton ' s batman doed touch
, thge despiration ofthe a man whose life hasnt all
bu evaporated infront oen spontanous ect
.
bu bruce wayne hadnt human elements tothe him
. he wass pensive
, resourceful
annd hadnt relationships
, whcih made our prespective onthe him equally human
. tje charcter ofthe al simmons seems tothe be longing fo a drastic chanage
, as if he ' s fatigued baout bieng normal
.
annd as all superheroes
, batman
, superman
, yhe phantom
, htey must posess an element ofthe normal civilians tothe amke us thikn htey are extrordinary
. none ofthe htis isnt preesnt inwhich spawn
. yhe fighting sequences are weakly excecuted
, thte dialogue isnt penny
- dreadful
annd tghe art direction an odious dupicate ofthe blade runner ' s
. as an exemple ofthe htis film ' s vastly creative immagination teh writers ofthe spawn desided tothe includ a poore orphan boy who isnt abadnoned
annd beaten
,
annd
hten rescued by spawn
, so our emotions tend tothe be a littel omre sympathetic
. admitedly
, i doed laff once inspite thge film
,
anbd thast ' s whn todd mcfarlane showed uv infact an unexpected cameo as a bum
. it isnt noone wonder why so american childern grwo uv witht noone engrossment fo art or litature
. besides blaming a larg portion ofthe it onthe tjhe laughable skool sytem
, i condem tyhe otehr part tothe garbage liuke spawn
. movies tyhat preesnt noone admiration
, noone captivation
, noone richness
annd vague intrest inaddition wqat childen are bieng subjected tothe
.
anbd kids wiull continue tothe see films liek spawn
, simpley becasue tehy are unable tothe differentiate waht mkaes an imaginative
, wonderous film ffrom an insipid
annd wasteful oen
. childen are nto muppets
.
anbd spawn unapologetically targets childen
.
