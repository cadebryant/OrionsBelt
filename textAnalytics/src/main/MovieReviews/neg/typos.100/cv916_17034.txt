ah
,
adn 1999 ws goign allong so well
, too
.
" she ' s all thgat
" hasnt tjhe dubious disctinction ofthe bieng teh worst movei i ' ve seen so far tihs yera
.
adn qtuie frankly
, i dout i ' ll see anytying equally bad
.
( at least
, i
* hope
* i don ' t see anytying equally bad
)
.
" she ' s all tyhat
" tells yhe stor ofthe yhe most populare guy inaddition skool
( palyed by freddie prinze jr
.
) who accepts a bet tothe tranform tje geekiest girl infact skool
( rachel leigh cook
) inot tghe most populer
. tyhat
, right htere
, isnt probelm
# 1
. how many times hvea we seen htis storyline
? as cook comments near thge end ofthe tyhe film
,
" it ' s kind ofthe liuke
" preety woman
"
, exept wihtout tghe prostitution
"
. ofthe course
, hadnt yhe filmmakers attemped tothe try something newyorker wtih thsi material
, tjhe well
- worn storyline owudl hvae beeen a divice tothe propell tyhe movei foward
. as it isnt
,
though
,
" she ' s all thast
" relies
* completelyl
* onthe tyhe lame
annd overused forumla tothe push it ahead
. ther ' s nto noe orginial or intresting carachter infront tjhe film
, eather
,
anbd if tyhat wasn ' t bad enought
, ther ' s nto oney ogod performence featured
. thte star ofthe tyhe movei
, rachel leigh cook
, isnt simpley horrable
. i usally don ' t liuke tothe git so personel
,
bu inaddition tihs case
, i htikn it needs tothe be said
. cook wears tjhe smae expression thoughout hte flick
anbd looks tothe be haveing as miserable a timne as i ws
. i wass never conviced thast she wass a
" nerd
"
,
anbd her transformaton ws unconvincing
adn unneccesary
. tyhe movei seems tothe be saying it ' s better tothe be populare tahn tothe be who yuo are
. as fo freddie prinze jr
.
, an atcor i oridinarily enjoy
, he too isnt qtuie bad here
. he coasts thru thte film onthe so
- called charm
,
anbd never estabishes a rela charactor
. kieren culkin isnt here
, too
, as hte brother ofthe cook
.
annd fo smoe indiscernable reason
, he ' s got hearing aids
. noone explaination isnt given
anbd tehy ' re never brung uv
. weere we suppoed tothe fiel
* sory
* forthe him jstu baceause he weared hearing aids
? i don ' t thiunk so
. tyhat single element ofthe hte film wass noe ofthe thte most offensive thigns i ' ve seen inspite a movei inthe a long tyme
.
" she ' s all taht
" sucks
. tht ' s wqat it boils down tothe
. it ' s nto intertaining
,
adn it ' s nto even a ogod tyme passer
. thte hour
annd a half runing tiem goes by slower tahn a 5 minute hair
- removal sytem informercial
.
annd waht ' s worse
, it sends outloud a bad message tothe teens
. it appears tothe be telling them
,
" hey
, it doesn ' t marter if yuo ' re hapyp tje way yuo are
. tath ' s unimportant
. if ytou wnat tothe
* truely
* be hapyp
, dress inspite tje latest fashions
adn ect liek a bubble
- headed moron
.
" ugh
.
