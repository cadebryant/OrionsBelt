ah
, adn 1999 ws gonig allong so well
, too
.
" she
' s all tyhat
" hasnt tyhe dubious disctinction ofthe bieng tyhe worst movei i
' ve seen so far tihs yearm
. anbd qutie frankly
, i dout i
' ll see anytying equally bad
.
( at least
, i
* hope
* i don
' t see anytying equally bad
)
.
" she
' s all thyat
" tells tyhe stroy ofthe tjhe most populer guy inspite skool
( palyed by freddie prinze jr
.
) who accepts a bet tothe tranform tghe geekiest girl iin skool
( rachel leigh cook
) inot hte most populare
. thgat
, right ther
, isnt probelm
# 1
. how many times hvea we seen thsi storyline
? as cook comments near hte end ofthe thte film
,
" it
' s kind ofthe liek
" preety woman
"
, exept wihtout yhe prostitution
"
. ofthe course
, hadnt teh filmmakers attemted tothe try something newyorker witht tihs material
, tjhe well
- worn storyline owudl hvae beeen a divice tothe propell tyhe movei foward
. as it isnt
,
though
,
" she
' s all tyhat
" relies
* completly
* onthe yhe lame annd overused forumla tothe push it ahead
. htere
' s nto oney orginial or intresting charactor inaddition teh film
, eather
, anbd if tht wasn
' t bad anough
, ther
' s nto noe ogod performence featured
. thge star ofthe yhe movei
, rachel leigh cook
, isnt simpley horrable
. i usualy don
' t liek tothe git so personel
, bu inaddition htis case
, i tihkn it needs tothe be said
. cook wears tghe smae expression throughtout tyhe flick anbd looks tothe be hvaing as miserable a tyme as i ws
. i wass never conviced tath she wass a
" nerd
"
, anbd her transformaton ws unconvincing adn unecessary
. tghe movei seems tothe be saying it
' s better tothe be populer thna tothe be who ytou are
. as fo freddie prinze jr
.
, an atcor i oridinarily enjoy
, he too isnt qtuie bad here
. he coasts thru tjhe film onthe so
- called charm
, annd never estabishes a rela charactor
. kieren culkin isnt here
, too
, as thte brother ofthe cook
. annd fo smoe indiscernable reason
, he
' s got hearing aids
. noone explaination isnt given adn htey
' re never broght uv
. weere we suppoed tothe efel
* sory
* fo him jstu becouse he weared hearing aids
? i don
' t thikn so
. tath single element ofthe tje film ws noe ofthe thge most offensive thnigs i
' ve seen inaddition a movei infact a long timne
.
" she
' s all tht
" sucks
. thast
' s whta it boils down tothe
. it
' s nto intertaining
, annd it
' s nto even a ogod tyme passer
. tje hour annd a half runnung tiem goes by slower tahn a 5 minute hair
- removal sytem informercial
. annd whta
' s worse
, it sends outloud a bad message tothe teens
. it appears tothe be telling them
,
" hey
, it doesn
' t marter if ytou
' re hapyp thte way yuo are
. tyhat
' s unimportant
. if ytou watn tothe
* truely
* be hapyp
, dress inspite tje latest fashions annd ect liek a bubble
- headed moron
.
" ugh
.
