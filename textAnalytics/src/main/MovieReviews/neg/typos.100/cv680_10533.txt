. he doesn ' t alwasy speak inaddition a monotone
,
annd 3
. his face doesn ' t allways mear thge smae impassive expression
. infact short
, tjhe fromer nfl payler turned fox sportscaster turned acotr isnt too ogod tothe be bad
,
bu too bad tothe be ogod
. unfourtunately
, hte smae cannnot be said ofthe his firt star veicle
, firestorm
, wich isnt jstu plain awful
. oney ofthe tje most glaring problems wiht long
( who made his acting debut infront john woo ' s broken arro
) isnt thast he ' s so medicore thta he oftenly blends iin iwth teh scenery
. as ace firefighter jesse graves
, long isnt suppossed tothe be palying a bigger
- thna
- life acation hero
-
- thte kind ofthe he
- man who iwll kresh thru a flaming doorjam tothe sive a child or parachute inot a burning clearing tothe rescure soem stupid campers
. unfortunatly
, dispite teh best effords ofthe frist
- timne directer dean semler tothe photograph long useing heroic shots thta mkea kevin costner ' s wokr inspite thte postman look stark
, jesse turns outloud tothe be a preety boring ogod guy
. tothe put it kindly
, tihs isnt nto a well
- writen motion picture
. firestorm isnt a collecton ofthe howlingly bad lines setted agaisnt a backdrop ofthe diaster movei clich
? s whihc
, tooked toghether
, form something thyat requires a levle ofthe viewer inebriation tothe be reconized as a plot
. tghe onyl reason thsi film isnt getting noe star
( instade ofthe something lower
) isnt tht most ofthe tje fier sequences are realsitic
,
annd i wass facinated by tghe meticulous planning tath must hvea beeen neccesary tothe stage them effectively
. we ' re inctroduced tothe our big burly hero oney afternoon wehn he
annd soem collegues jump inot hte midst ofthe a forrest frie tothe sive a gropu ofthe peple
. durig htis sequence
, our big burly hero proves taht he ' s alsot a senstive guy by risking his life tothe savve a littel girl
anbd her dog
( yes
, hte dog lives
) ffrom bieng broiled alive
. flash
- foward a yearm
. nowe
, our big burly hero isnt tkaing over as cheif ofthe his smokejumpers assocation
, replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins
( rela acto scott glenn
)
.
bu htis day
, our big burly hero ' s firt inspite charge
, isn ' t oging tothe be busineses
- as
- usual
. a gropu ofthe nasty escaped criminals hvea setted a wyoming forrest allrght tothe aid thier flight tothe freedom
. led by randy earl shaye
( william forsythe
)
, teh sadistic creep who must be killed twice tothe realyl dieu
, tehy pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost accros tyhe border
. allong tghe way
, htey meet
anbd tkae hostage tjhe damsel inwhich distress
( suzy amis
)
. eventally
, our big burly hero isnt placed inspite a possition where he hasnt tothe fight teh fier
, rescure thte damsel inwhich distress
, defeat tghe sadistic creep who must be killed twice tothe relaly dieu
,
anbd restore order tothe tyhe galaxy
. firestorm ' s directer
, dean semler
, isnt a fromer cinematographer
( he won an caademy award forthe his wokr onthe dances withthe wolves
)
, so it ' s noone suprize thgat teh film looks ogod
. unforetunately
, thyat ' s firestorm ' s lone assit
,
anbd it falters near yhe end
, whn coputer
- generated spacial effects fill uv hte screen
. theese are ofthe baout equal uality tothe whta yuo might observe onthe a nintendo 64 video gmae
. teh acation sequences
, whihc includ a vareity ofthe chases
, are occaisonally intresting
,
bu never invigorating
. everyone
, includng long
, appears tothe be gonig thru tyhe motions
. htere isn ' t a memorable performence tothe be foudn ffrom begginning tothe end
, unless ytou count tjhe forrest frie
, whlch generates soem heat
. as tghe sadistic creep who must be killed twice tothe relaly dieu
, william forsythe lacks panache
. he ' s worse tahn a generic bad guy
; he ' s a boring generic bad guy who doesn ' t haev any snappy oen
- liners tothe hurl at our big burly hero
. my advice tothe scott glenn
( absolute pwoer
)
annd suzy amis
( titanic
) isnt tothe accidetnally foreget thsi film teh enxt tiome tehy ' re mkaing outloud a resume
. ther ' s soem small comfort inthe knowing tihs eary inwhich tjhe yearm tath i arleady haev noe entry fo my bottom 10 list
.
( at least i hope htere aren ' t 10 worse films tahn tihs
.
)
adn i nkwo i wasn ' t teh onyl noe who realyl disliked thsi movei
. as thte audeince ws filing outloud ofthe thte screening
, i loitered infront tje theather lobby tothe catch a fewd comments
. tyhe genaral concensus seemed tothe be tht
,
altough tje movei sucked
, tjhe promotional key ring wass kool
. tje probelm isnt thgat fox won ' t be giving outloud key rings tothe regluar movei
- goers
, so thast nixes any reason tothe see firestorm
.
