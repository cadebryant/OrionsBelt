" mission tothe mars
" isnt noe ofthe thsoe annoying movies where
, inaddition tje middle ofthe thge movei
, ytou git teh sneaking suspision tath yhe reason hte trailer looks so ogod isnt becouse tehy showcased all yhe best parts ofthe yhe movei
: all five mintues ofthe it
.
" mission
"
* doens
* give ytou payoff
; bu whn it doesnt cmo
, it
' s too littel
, too lite
.
" mission
" hasnt soem ogod idesa
, bu tehy git lost inthe tyhe unbearably boring delivery
, dime
- a
- dozen dialogue
, adn spate ofthe ogod actors wasted inthe cardboard
- cutout roles
. i
' m sure tjhe directer adn writers weere vyre proud ofthe eahc hallmark moent tehy cameback uv witht
, so tehy strech eahc dramtic moent outloud liek silly putty utnil it loses all its charm
. glances don
' t communicate any deeper emotions jsut becasue yuo draw them outloud fo five horus onthe end
. tje film spends an hour onthe tihs kind ofthe tsuff
, buiding tothe its climax
. a lot ofthe it isnt a cliched glorification ofthe famaly relationships
, marrage
, friendship
, uite we st
and devided we fall kind ofthe crap
. ther are soem spectauclar spacial effects sequences inthe htis film
, anbd i give it points forthe trying tothe stay true tothe tghe scinece i konw
( trying isnt tghe key owrd here
)
. thte sequence witht yhe martian demonstrating theri ihstory isnt oddly beatiful anbd touching
, bu as maintioned by thne we
' re so sick ofthe hte goddamn thign we wanna thte movei tothe be over
. grat desgin
, ogod intentions
, bu noone cigar
. if yuo
' re nto a dieu hard sci
- fi
, fx or jerry o
' connell fan
( his charachter isnt yhe onyl noe who hasnt smoe semblance ofthe chracter
)
, don
' t waste your eight bucks onthe htis
. annd waht thte hell
, tim robbins died halfway thru hte movei
, inaddition a stupid way too
. thyat
' s jsut unforgiveable
