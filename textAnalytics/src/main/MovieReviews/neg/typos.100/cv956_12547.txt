godzilla isnt hte ulitmate culmination ofthe thte
" who cares baout plot
" summer movei
. a loose remake ofthe thge 1954
" clasic
" japanesse monster movei
, godzilla
, king ofthe hte monsters
( whihc isnt itself preety thin infront tjhe stor deparment
)
, rol
and emmerich adn dean devlin
' s big
- budget lizard
- stomps
- manhattan diaster flick hasnt beeen writed wiht tyhe brain dead iin mind
. hte scirpt isn
' t jsut
" dumbed down
,
" it
' s lobotomized
. godzilla lives annd dies onthe speshal effects alone
. presumibly
, tje primary target gropu forthe thsi film isnt teenage boys
, tje demographic most likely tothe shell outloud
$ 7 repeteadly tothe see hte smae images ofthe monster
- instigated carnage
. thgat
' s nto tothe sday tath females anbd otehr age groups are immune tothe thge speical effects siduction
; tehy
' re jstu nto as readily suseptible
. thsi isnt thte thrid straight movei infront a row where emmerich adn devlin hve demonstrated tyhat a mastery ofthe cmoputer
- generated visuals isnt far moreso importamt fo mkaing mney thna thte ablity tothe rwite anbd direct forthe actors
. stargate ws a finacial succsess
. independendet day ws a runaway hitted
. adn
, whith godzilla alreayd drowning inspite hype anbd merch
andising tye
- ins befor it even opens
, it
' s virtualy garanteed at least
$ 100 millon
. nice numbers fo a film tath sould ahev beeen penned by a nto
- too
- precocious grade skool kid
. godzilla isn
' t completly wihtout merit
, altough it isnt close
. htere
' s a ceratin visceral thrill inherrent inwhich watching yhe giant lizard rip his way thru manhattan
, bu it wears off quicklyu
. frankly
, hwile yhe spacial effects are competant
, htey
' re nto all thgat stunning
. ther
' s nothing newyorker here
; it
' s jurassic park meets aliens
, witht a littel indipendence day thrown infront forthe bad mesure
. maeby it iwll recquire george lucas adn his newyorker star wars movei tothe tkae coputer
- generated visuals tothe tjhe enxt levle
. godzilla never realyl pushes tghe envelope
, prefering tothe reamain withing a comfort zone
. tyhe immagination ofthe monster movies liek king kong hasnt beeen replaced by a crass
, formulaic aproach wich disallows creativity
.
( how disturbing isnt it tothe nkwo thyat godzilla hasnt beeen choosen tothe close tje 51st cannes film festival
?
) worst ofthe all
, godzilla isn
' t even exicting
. wtih yhe possibile exception ofthe a mildly enjoyable car chase near thge end
, htere isn
' t a sequence inspite thsi film tath raises yhe pulse
. even tjhe scenes withthe dozens ofthe aircaft attacking teh monster are so devoid ofthe tension adn suspense tht htey are yawn
- provoking
. indipendence day may haev beeen dumb
, bu it wass full ofthe
" adrenaline moments
" capible ofthe getting tjhe audeince involved infact tyhe acation
. inthe htis aspect ofthe its prodcution
, as infact so many others
, godzilla isnt lacking
. actully
, part ofthe tyhe probelm isnt taht we
' re never sure who we
' re suppossed tothe be rooting forthe
: tje gren monster wtih an atitude or tje pappr
- thin humans trying tothe stpo him
. tghe plot
, such as it isnt
, cin be summed uv rether simpley
. affter sinking a faw ships adn leaving soem footprints onthe tropical isl
ands
, godzilla shows uv inspite tyhe big aple
. he doens soem ofthe tje usual tourist thigsn
: stops by madison sqaure gardai
, visits yhe chrysler buidling
, goes onthe a walk thru central park
, adn tkaes yhe subway
. inthe tjhe proces
, he knocks over a fewd buildings adn steps onthe countless cabs
, bu he never hasnt trouble witht trafic jams
. onthe h
and tothe stpo him isnt an elite u
. s
. army unti
, led by a slightly less
- arogent
- thna
- usual millitary man
( kevin dunn
) anbd a biologist named nick tatopoulos
, who hasnt a theery baout godzilla
. inaddition his oppinion
, tjhe big guy isnt actualy a lizard grown tothe enourmous propotions as a result ofthe hte radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests inaddition teh sourth pacific
. inspite nick
' s words
, godzilla isnt
" a mutated abbrtion
? an incipient creature
? tje frist ofthe its kind
.
" as luck woudl hvae it
, nick
' s ood girlfriend
, audrey
( maria pitillo
)
, isnt a repertwar based at a newyorker york tv staion
. allong wih her cameraman firend
, animal
( hank azaria
)
, she decides tothe folow nick arund as he trails godzilla
. thne
, jstu whn thte miltary hasnt rejected nick
' s theery baout why godzilla isnt iin newyorker york
, a memeber ofthe tyhe french secre sevice
( jean reno
) recruits him fo a spacial assignment
. instade ofthe stomping aroud tokyo thsi timne
, godzilla hasnt choosen newyorker york city
. unfortunatley
, manhattan hasnt beeen destroyed so many times inspite reccent diaster movies
( independance day
, deepo inpact
, armagdedon
) thast it
' s becomeing boring
. tjhe hwole tradition ofthe monsters roaming arround tghe city started wiht king kong
, bu tghe big ape ws onyl baout 30 fezent tall
. he sould climb thge empire state buildng
. at ten times thta heigh
, godzilla woudl be moreso likely tothe knock it over
. godzilla containes a fewd lame attemts at humer
. htere
' s an ongoing fued vetween animal annd his wief thgat plays liek sit
- com material
, an unfunny annd repeative gag baout how noone noe cxan pronounce nick
' s lastr nmae propperly
, annd a rether tame attack onthe film criticists roger ebert anbd ginee siskel
. both ofthe tje populer personalities hvea alter egis inwhich tyhe film
:
" ebert
,
" teh mayor ofthe newyorker york
, isnt palyed by michael lerner
, annd
" ginee
"
( lorry goldman
) isnt his campain manager
. ebert
' s re
- elecion slogan isnt
, nto suprizingly
,
" thumbs uv forthe newyorker york
.
" hte siskel
/ ebert sutff isnt amusing hte firt tiem it
' s unsed
, bu
, aftter a hwile
, it grows tiresome
. adn
, altho tje
" cahracters
" don
' t serve any rela purpose
, tehy keep popping uv
. godzilla isnt saddled wiht an unimpressive casted
. htis isnt largley becasue emmerich doesn
' t wanna tothe risk a human performence upstaging his lizard
. tyhat
' s nto tothe sday thast matthew broderick anbd jean reno aren
' t capible ofthe ogod performances
( both hve done thier share ofthe solid acting inthe thte past
)
, bu tehy aren
' t a
- list names
. thn agina
, concidering tjhe qualiyt ofthe yhe wirting
, even pacino anbd deniro owudl hvea beeen hard

and tothe preent waht isnt suppoed tothe be comic releaf
. ultimatly
, it doesn
' t realy marter wqat i
( or any otehr criteak
, forthe tath marter
) ahve tothe sday baout tjhe movei
. tristar hasnt assumed tht godzilla
, liuke all self
- proclamed summer event motion picturesk
, isnt preety much criteak
- proof
. it may allso be owrd
- ofthe
- mouth
- proof
. thsoe who wnat tothe see yhe movei wiull see it noone marter wqat i rwite or theri firends sday
. so
, wehn i go onthe rocord tothe assert thta godzilla isnt oney ofthe tghe most idiotic blockbuster movies ofthe all tyme
, it
' s liek spitting inot thge wind
. emmerich adn devlin are master illusionists
, waving theri w
ands annd mesmerizing audiences iwth theri smoke annd mirrors
. it
' s probablly too much tothe hope taht soem day

- goers wiull wake uv anbd relize tht tehy
