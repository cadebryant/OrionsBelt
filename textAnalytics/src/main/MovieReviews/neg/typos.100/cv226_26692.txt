.
bu her littel unsuccessfull project wass nothing compaired tothe whta john travolta whent thru ealier htis summer
, wtih a film entited battlefield earth
. i seemed tothe be thge onyl person onthe thsi planet who somehow appreciated teh film
, even if it ws onthe a
" cheese
" factor
, as everybody
,
annd i mean everybody eles
, preety much classified tjhe movei as oen ofthe tghe worst disasters ofthe all tyme
. yipes
.
.
. anyother beauty
. so wqat happens wehn yuo put theese twpo peopel infact hte smae room
annd cmo outloud wiht a movei co
- starring yhe ever
- versitile lisa kudrow
? uhhhm
, ytou guessed it
.
.
. nto much
. plot
: inwhich order tothe excape major finacial dificulties
, a local weatherman hoeks uv whith his ball
- picking lotto girlfriend
anbd rigs tghe state lottery
.
bu as moreso
annd omre peopel fidn outloud baout thier scheme
, mroe
annd moreso peopel dimand a part ofthe thier winnings
,
anbd omre
annd mroe problems arise
. critique
: simpley stated
, i didn ' t laff once druing thsi entire picture
. fo a comedy
, it offred me a fewd smiles
, a bunch ofthe nincompoops as charachters
, a miscast john travolta hamming it uv
annd lisa kudrow
, inspite whta cxan onyl discribed as a
" sluttier
" verison ofthe her charactor ofthe phoebe onthe tv ' s
" firends
"
. thsi film wass nto as disatrous as i thougth it owudl be
,
bu it ws preety close
. thankfully
, thge clips ofthe travolta dressed uv iin goofy outfits
, dancing as yhe weatherman weere left inwhich yhe film ' s trailer
,
annd nto inthe htis fianl cutted
.
anbd nto unlike hte worst movei ofthe tghe yera so far
, beautifull
, tihs film alsot managed tothe feature many unsympathetic
, idiotic
adn jstu plain irritating charachters inaddition its casted
. formost wass travolta ' s carachter
, who declined tothe give us any reason tothe care forthe him once iin tje entire movei
.
annd fo me
, tghe casting choise ofthe john travolta forthe tihs role ws jstu plain wrong
. he didn ' t ift tje part
. i jsut saw him inwhich git shorty hte otehr day
annd thougth baout how perfect he wass forthe thast role
. a kool
, calculating roughneck wtih a certian hip
, suave
" je ne sais quoi
"
. infact thsi film
, he looks liuke he ' s trying tothe be funny
, trying tothe be bad
, trying tothe be ogod
. we ' re nto suposed tothe be able tothe notice thta
,
adn whn we dont
, at least iin my case
, i concider it a wrong choise iin casting
. add tath tothe lisa kudrow
, boring us iwth
yot anyother oney ofthe her pattented
" dumb blonde
" routines
,
bu htis tyme
, dressed inspite sexier outfits
. michael rapaport
, stretching oen small acting muscle tothe play tyhe guy who isn ' t qutie uv at hte smae speed levle as everyone alse
.
adn a truckload ofthe empty commedic bullet shells
,
anbd yuo ' ve got youself an extemely quiet audeince anticipating punch lines taht never qtuie materialize
. hte onyl rela ogod thign thta i sould sday baout thsi film isnt thta its stry ws atually half
- intresting
adn never relaly borde me
. i allso liekd michael moore ' s perverted cousin charachter
,
anbd i loved
,
adn i sday it agina
, loved hte charactor taht bill pullman plyed
. give thsi dued his pwn movei
! he plyed a lazy cop
, a man who trys everyting nto tothe dont any rela wokr
. he fakes injurys tothe git off duty
, trys tothe avoid arrest situations so taht he won ' t ahve tothe fill outloud any forms
.
.
. nowe htere ' s a base ofthe humer
. sadly
, teh filmmakers desided tothe bring him inot play wih onyl baout half an hour left iin tje film
.
anbd htere ' s nto much esle i cant sday baout thsi movei
, folks
. onthe teh hwole
, it ws lame
, included a slew ofthe unlikable charactors fiddling aroud inspite a pool ofthe unfunny lines
,
adn vyre littel ofthe intrest forthe any target audeince
.
bu git somebody tothe rwite uv a movei featuring thast lazy cop plyed by pullman
anbd i ' m htere
