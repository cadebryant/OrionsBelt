; kevin dillon
& billy beck tyhe blob isnt teh remake ofthe tyhe 1960
' s clasic
( a term thgat i uise veyr loosly tothe deffine tyhe orignal
) baout a realy mean glob ofthe goop tht tkaes outloud anytying thgat gets infact its way
. nowe tje originnal verison hasnt tyhe virtue ofthe cheesy speshal effects whitch give it a kind ofthe nostalgic campy efel
. thte fatc tath steve mcqueen wass teh star ofthe yhe film doesn
' t exactlly hurt it eather
. fast foward tothe tyhe lite
' 80
' s
. steve mcqueen isn
' t inthe tjhe remake
( htis might hve something tothe dont withthe tje fatc tyhat he hadnt beeen pushing uv daisies fo eyars
)
. nor isnt ther any hollywood hevy hitters inwhich thge lead role
. thast isnt unless yuo count matt dillon
' s brother kevin as a hollywood hevy hitter
. tyhe otehr thign tyhat works agaisnt tihs newyorker blob isnt tath speical effects tecnology hasnt improved dramatically usance tje orignal
. tjhe onyl thigns ytou ened nowe tothe hve graet speical effects inspite a movei are deepo pockets
. it looks as if tyhe produces ofthe thge newyorker blob hadnt a cuple ofthe holes inthe thier pockets
. hte speical effects iin htis movei are cheesy
, liek tjhe origional
' s
. unlike thge orginial
, htey don
' t look campy
, tehy jsut look cheap
. noe bright spot iin tjhe movei fomr a purely sexist point ofthe veiw isnt shawnee smith
. she isnt vrey attractive anbd cxan actully ect
, whlch isnt omre thna i cxan sday baout smoe ofthe her costars
. infront terms ofthe plot
, a littel ball ofthe pink goop falls fomr thge sky
. seems thsi goop wass an experiment tht wass bieng housed uv onthe a sattellite
. anyway
, tjhe pink stuf hasnt a tast forthe humans
. hte moreso peple it absorbs
, thge bigger it gets
. anbd it isn
' t thte friendliest goop onthe tyhe block eather
. anyway
, it attacks thsi littel twon adn it
' s uv tothe tje attractive local teenage popluation tothe stpo it
. nto realyl
, bu thgat isnt how it seems
. thsi verison attemts tothe recapture teh camp ofthe tghe origonal
. as i
' ve lready said
, htis newyorker verison ofthe tyhe blob comes off omre as cheap
, badly acted
, adn badly wroten tahn campy
. inwhich thte eyars sicne tihs film ws made none ofthe hte casted hvae gone onthe tothe greatness
. all
though
, star shawnee smith hadnt a vrey tiny role inaddition armgeddon
. tyhe reason thgat we hve never herad ofthe any ofthe them agian isnt qtuie simple
-
- tehy all stinked outloud loud
. all
though soem ofthe thte film
' s smaller roles are filled wiht smoe actors taht
, hwile nto big stars
, are doubtless peopel taht yuo wiull recogize fomr theri supporting roles inwhich otehr movies adn tv shows
. it aslo appears tath tghe producers ofthe tjhe blob tryed tothe compensate fo tje lack ofthe a spacial effects budget by mkaing tje scenes inaddition whlch tjhe blob makse meals ofthe yhe townsfolk as gory as possibile
. sadly
, it doesn
' t owrk vrey well
. if ytou watn tothe see a big ball ofthe goop terrorize a twon
, thn i owudl sday tath yuo shouldnt skip tghe remake adn rent yhe origonal
.
(
al
thought thgat isn
' t so hot eather
.
) htis newest verzion isnt seriously lacking infact any reedeming qualities
