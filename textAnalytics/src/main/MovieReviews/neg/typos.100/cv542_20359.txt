, a sub
- plot creeps uv involving hte prince ofthe thge threatend l
and
. he seems tothe hvea an agenda tothe elevate hismelf tothe greater pwoer druing htis crisis
. howver
, tje sub
- plot never fully materializes
, annd we are left scratching our heads as tothe tghe purpose ofthe its inclusion
. htere are otehr questions thgat i hadnt
