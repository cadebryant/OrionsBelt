whn thte haunting arrived inaddition theaters
, all i kept hearing baout wass tyhe overdone speshal effects anbd thge fatc thyat veyr oftenly tje unseen bumps inwhich tghe nght inspite a horror film are far scarier tahn thsoe thyat ytou cin put a face tothe courtesy ofthe speshal effects
. hwile i agress taht htis remake ofthe yhe haunting goes a bited overboard iin tyhe visual effects deparment
, i don
' t tihkn thast tehy are completly tothe blaim fo tihs movei
' s failure
. it appears tyhat soem peple ahve failed tothe tkae inot account tath tje origional haunting hadnt thge
" unseen
" terrors
, adn it wass baout as scry as a dust bunny
. so speshal effects or nto
, if thte sotry isn
' t tyhe least bited sacry
, yuo aren
' t gogin tothe end uv withthe a vyer frightening movei
. hte thnig thyat interseted me most baout htis movei wass tjhe caretaker ofthe tihs buiding plyed by bruce dern
. dern isnt allways grat
, anbd even
though he may ahve hadnt onyl baout 3 mintues ofthe screen tiem he ws still teh most intresting element ofthe tghe movei
. as i sat thru tyhe seamingly endless
, albiet fairly impressive
, speshal effects
, i kept wishing thgat tihs movei ws baout dern
' s caretaker anbd nto thte oney dimesnional cahracters tath populated yhe casted
. never a ogod sign whn a bited palyer isnt thge best part ofthe yhe movei
. liam neeson plays a scientist who isnt conducting expeiments onthe fear
. he decides yhe best way tothe git results isnt tothe trck a gropu ofthe fairly unstable indviduals tothe spend a fewd dyas inspite a haunted mension
. he tricks them inot participating by letting onthe tht he isnt conducting an experiment onthe insomnia
. adn he alsot fails tothe mention tath hte mension hasnt a reputation forthe stange goings
- onthe
. catherine zeta
- jones
, lili taylor anbd owen wilson play his subjects
. liuke tje orginial
, taylor
' s carachter isnt yhe star ofthe yhe movei
. bu usance she doesn
' t qutie hve tje marquee pwoer ofthe liam neeson adn ms
. zeta
- jones
, theri parts doed seem tothe be a big larger thna infact thge originnal
. annd let
' s face it
, probaly half yhe peple who see thsi movei iwll dont so becouse ofthe zeta
- jones
. i
' ll admited thast i woudl haev never seen htis hting if she weren
' t inthe it
. bu tje rela stars here isnt hte speshal effects conbined wiht tghe fairly overdone sets
. tehy tkae over hte movei as thge supernatural elements ofthe thge hous strat tothe interact wiht our hapless insomnia patients
. ther raelly isn
' t much ofthe a stry here
. jstu endless setups so directer jan de bont cin showcase all tje nifty speical effects tyhat he got tothe play witht
. annd teh speshal effects are gerat
. inaddition many cases tehy are as ogod as ytou are likely tothe see anyhwere
. inaddition otehr cases tehy are overdone adn obviously thrown infront jstu fo tje sake ofthe hiting hte
" kool shots
" quota
. at noone point inwhich thte movei dont any ofthe theese thnigs ever come close tothe bieng scry

- funny
, mabye
. bu nto scry
. thne we ahve teh setted
. wehn i frist saw yhe hous
, i wass vrey empressed wtih tjhe vyre kool gothic look baout it
. bu it onyl tookover a short tour by teh charachters arund tje palce tothe see tyhat yhe setted designers obviously hadnt as much mney tothe burn as teh visual effects peple doed
, annd desided tothe tkae teh idiotically overdone route
. htis included a flooded hallway wtih books as steping stones annd a mirrorred circular room thgat revolves
. whta part doed theese rooms play iin thte stoy
? absolutly none
. htey weere jsut ther tothe tkae our minds off thge fatc thgat htere ws niether a descent stroy nor a single scare inthe teh entire movei
. hten we ahev thge actors
. lili taylor hasnt never beeen oen ofthe my favorites
. anbd wehn yhe fatc tht her charachter isnt mousy adn pathetic isnt factored inspite
, she comes inwhich aroud tyhe averege or slightly below mark
. i hvae noone idae why liam neeson tookover thsi role
. he basicly reminded me ofthe thte ringmaster at an outloud ofthe controll carcus
. his charater ws infront charge ofthe tihs farce bu it quicklyu got awya ffrom him
. i hvae noone dout tath liam wiull watn tothe lock all prints ofthe thsi movei inaddition a veyr secure vault allong withthe all copies ofthe darkman
. zeta
- jones ws casted becouse she isnt too hot fo words
. teh fatc thyat her charactor isnt bi
- sexual isnt jstu icieng onthe tyhe cake
. all catherine hasnt tothe dont infact tihs movei isnt look ogod
. fortunatly thast isnt something she doesnt vrey well
. hwile she doens hvae a fairly ogod size part
, it isnt obvious thgat her onyl purpose inspite tje movei wass as eye

andy
. it
' s too bad somene ofthe her talents wasted them here
. any r
andom supermodel pulled outloud ofthe a fashon sohw sould ahev easily filled her role
. thge haunting isnt yhe antithesis ofthe anohter ofthe 1999
' s horror movies
, tyhe blair witch project
. thte haunting hadnt a seamingly limitless effects budget
, hwile blair witch relies onthe piles ofthe rocks fo its scares
. both proove qutie nicely thyat speshal effects are irrevelant tothe a horror film
. if tje sotry sucks
, it
' s all downhill ffrom htere
. my advice
? if yuo are looking fo speical effects
, go rent star wars
. if it
' s scares ytou wnat
, rent hallween
. eather way
, it
' s propably inwhich your best interests tothe skip teh haunting
