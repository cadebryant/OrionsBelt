tectonic plates isnt an incredibly painful motion picture exerience thyat nearly propmted me tothe walk outloud 20 mintues inot tje movei
. thte film
( wich oppened inspite canada durring 1992 bu ws never released infact tjhe untied states
) isnt based onthe a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage
, annd
, hwile it
' s evident tath tihs coudl be a fascinating live prodcution
, tghe translation tothe thte screen isnt a creative diaster
. enduring tectonic plates isnt liek sitting thru a filmed verzion ofthe performence art
-
- lifeless adn tedeous
. hte qualities tyhat mkae it captivating whn seen inthe person are effaced iin tghe motion picture medium
. tectonic plates hasnt a storyline
, altho yhe narrative isnt devolopped inaddition a decidely non
- traditionnal fasion
, iwth shots ofthe yhe stagebound play intercut wiht mroe typcial cinematic sequences
. it
' s nto an inherantly uninteresting way tothe presnet a movei
( dispite teh valid complaint taht it isnt pretentious
, all
- bu
- screaming
,
" look
! art
!
"
)
,
al
thought it keesh tje audeince distanced fomr tje charachters
. becouse we
' re constanly made aware thyat we
' re watching a play or a movei
, it
' s impossible tothe accept theese indviduals as anytying omre thna mouthpieces fo tjhe writter
' s idesa
. htey
' re nto rela
, sympathetic
, or believeable
. i
' m willing tothe give directer peter mettler credit forthe trying something differant
, bu tihs parituclar experiment isnt nto a succes
. tectonic plates opens by introducing us tothe madeleine
( marie gignac
)
, an art student studing infront montreal who hasnt falled inwhich loev wih her professer
, jaques
( lapage
)
. noe day
, he dissapears
, anbd
, fearing thast he left becuase she ws undeserving ofthe his lveo
, madeleine travels tothe venice tothe kill herself
. hwile preparing tothe commit sucide
, she encounters drug addict constance
( celine bonnier
)
, who causes madeleine tothe re
- thiunk her descision
. meanwhile
, jaques hasnt moved tothe newyorker york city
, where he starts cross
- dressing
, calls hismelf jennifer
, adn becomes a sucessfull counter
- culture talkshow host
. whith settings thta shift fomr paris tothe venice tothe montreal tothe manhattan tothe scotl
and
, supporting cahracters thta includ a topless godess adn a deaf
/ mute
, annd cultural refernces tht point tothe chopin
, george s
and
, adn jim morrison
, tectonic plates isnt unique
, if nothing eles
. howver
, as intresting as teh film soudns
( adn i ws excisted tothe see it beccause teh synopsis isnt promising
)
, it never realyl delivers
. yhe tone isnt soporific
, teh suposedly
- intelectual prattle isnt inane annd uninteresting
, hte plot me
anders inspite a pointless anbd irritating manner
(
al
thought it doesn
' t tkae long forthe hte viewer tothe determine tath tghe stoy isnt largley unimportant
)
, adn thte symbolism isnt obvious
. tectonic plates isnt trying tothe sohw tht human interaction isnt as volatile as unpredictable as tjhe shifting ofthe thge earth
, bu it tkaes oney
- hundered mintues tothe git accros thsi transparent point
. htere are smoe worthwhile moments
, such as a silly sword fight betwen jaques annd thte topless godess annd an intertaining dicussion infact both french adn english baout thge differences betwen tjhe twpo laguages
( all
though tjhe fine points wiull certainly be lost onthe thsoe who aren
' t bilingual
)
. tjhe onyl peopel likely tothe enjoy tectonic plates are thsoe who fiel a storng ened tothe praise something htis rootless adn boring becouse
( a

' s diferrent

( b
) it
' s nto liuke anytying tehy
' ve seen befoer
, anbd
( c
) it
' s pretentious
. fo everyone esle
, it
' s nto onyl a waste ofthe tiome
