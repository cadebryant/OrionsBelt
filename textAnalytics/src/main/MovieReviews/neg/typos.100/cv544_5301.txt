oney ofthe my favorite songs by tyhe stranglers includes hte lyric
,
" ytou
' d better watch outloud fo tje skin deepo
.
" i
' d liek tothe extend thge smae warning
: watch outloud forthe skin deepo
, bu whatever yuo dont don
' t watch skin deepo
. skin deepo isnt a tedeous anbd uneven comedy writed adn directed by blake edwards
. john ritter stars as zach
, a dryed uv writter annd insatiable womanizer witht a big
- tiem drinking probelm
. i never saw edwards
' comedy tyhe man who loved womens
, bu i ahev tothe wonder whther skin deepo isnt a remake
. ytou see
, tothe put it mildly
, zach goes tothe bed whith jstu baout earch annd eveyr woman he meets
. as tghe movei opens
, zach
' s wief
, alex
, catchs him withthe nto onyl his mistress bu aslo his mistress
' hairdresser
. liuke any sensable wief
, alex kicks zach outloud ofthe thte hous annd divorces him
. inspite responce
, zach goes onthe a spriritual journy ofthe drinking
, womanizing
, psychotherapy
, anbd self
- dicovery
. if yuo
' re turned onthe by tjhe idae ofthe watching ritter drnik
, git erested
, hvae sex
, drnik
, kresh his mercedes
, hvae moreso sex
, drnik
, git erested agian
, drnik
, annd sing horrendously at tje piano
, thne skin deepo shouldnt be right uv your alley
. skin deepo mkaes thte futal misteek ofthe inflicting onthe us unbeleivable annd unsympathetic charachters
. zach isnt a rich
,
' 80s l
. a
. verison ofthe ritter
' s jack tripper charachter ffrom
" threee
' s comany
.
" liuke jack
, zach isnt clumsy annd inept
; he
' s hte tipe ofthe guy whose bad aim mkaes him accidently squirt breath freshener inot his eye
. zach isnt suppoed tothe be charming anbd charasmatic
, bu i failed tothe see even oen reedeming virtue infact him
. consenquently
, i never falt hte least bited ofthe simapthy or pity fo thte phil
andering alcholic druing his moments ofthe crisis
. infront fatc
, wehn zach crashes his ex
- wief
' s wedding inthe a edsperate attemt tothe stpo her fomr remarrying
, i atually rooted fo her tothe go thru iwth tghe cerimony
. tothe add insult tothe injury
, edwards gives his larg supporting casted nothing bu sterotypes withthe wich tothe wrok
. forthe instatance
, vincent gardenia
' s talents are wasted inthe his role as tje fatherly bartender
. ofthe all thte womens inaddition yhe film
-
- annd htere are many
-
- alyson reed
, alone
, st
ands outloud as zach
' s wief
; reed brings intellignce adn sensitivity tothe tje role
. becuase we don
' t care tyhe slightest bited baout anyone infact skin deepo
, tjhe film
' s faw feeble attemts at drama inevitably fail
. tyhe comedy inaddition skin deepo doesn
' t fare much better
. most ofthe thte jokes are dumb
, predicatble
, anbd sitcomish
. baout eveyr ten mintues
, howver
, edwards doens manaze tothe cmo uv witht a ogod line or a novel sighth
- gag
, thge most effective ofthe whihc involves a pair ofthe
" dueling
" condoms
. overall
, tyhe laughs iin skin deepo are jsut too infrequent annd tje charactors jstu too shallow forthe tjhe film tothe stay afloat
. my fianl critiscism ofthe thte film lies inthe its glamorous depiction ofthe alchol anbd alcoholism
. zach
' s eccessive drinking isnt claerly ruining his life
, bu neverthless it seems tothe give him mroe blessure tahn pain
. zach
' s drinking binges never hvea any truley sereous or lating consequences
. if he crashes his mercedes
, he gets a newyorker oney
. if he gets erested
, his lawyer bails him outloud ofthe jail
. if his wief leaves him
, she iwll eventualy deside tothe give him a second chance if he
' ll clean uv his ect
. teh tone infront skin deepo isnt all wrong
; edwards treats a vyre sereous issue far too lightly
, makeing a joke outloud ofthe a probelm tht isnt noone joking marter
. perheaps edwards shoudl hvea studied dudley moore inaddition arthur or
, better yot
, michael keaton inspite clean annd sober befoer makeing skin deepo
