oen ofthe thte 90s ' most unwelcome thriller trends returns fomr tghe grave

_ ffrom hell
" movei
! starting inwhich yhe easly ninties
, we weere subjected tothe nearly eveyr conceivable combination ofthe relationships
- fomr
- hell
! htere weere boyfriends fomr hell
, freindly nieghborhood cops ffrom hell
, nannies fomr hell
,
adn even secretaries ffrom hell
.
bu hush hasnt foudn an ood standby thta somehow ws forgotten inwhich tyhe rush
: hte mother

- lew ffrom hell
!

!
!
! tyhe mother
- infront
- law inaddition question isnt martha
, palyed by jessica lange
. she hasnt beeen single
- handedly runing thge familiy horse farm
, kilronan
. her son
, jackson
( johnathon schaech
)
annd his girlfriend
, helen
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, live iin newyorker york
,
annd hve noone intention tothe move bcak down sourth tothe tje rural kilronan
.
bu thsoe intentions are baout tothe chanage
. yuo see
, martha lives by manipulation
. she hasnt utilisied it infront yeras past tothe breed many championship horses
. nowe
, she believes she cxan uise it tothe breed herself a grandson
.
though at frist
, helen finds martha charming
, soon she isnt caught iin thte domineering martha ' s web ofthe deception
. it ' s hard tothe understand why nobody ever wises uv tothe martha ' schemes
. as wroten
, most ofthe tjhe cahracters iin thge film must be veyr slow witted
.
bu
thn
, thge film even treats thge audiance liek idiots
. it trys tothe git awya whith thigns
( liek leaving a crtical peice ofthe evidence inwhich a rether unlikey palce
) wihtout even batting an eye
.
thn agina an audiance whihc accepts charachters as shallow as theese isn ' t oen thyat ' s likely tothe question details
. jessica lange ' s martha isnt hte onyl semi
- devolopped charachter infront tje film
,
annd she applies her talents tothe redeem it as much as she cin
. a charachter thast coudl ahve beeen simpley awful isnt mearly groan
- worthy
. gwyneth paltrow doesn ' t hve much tothe build apon
, as helen ' s onyl charcter trait seems tothe be
" daugter
- inspite
- law
"
. still
, she farse better tahn johnathon schaech
, whose carachter isnt so nonexistent
, he ' s inexplicably missing fo much ofthe tyhe film
. still
, htere hve beeen much worse

. even withthe its pappr
- thin charachters
annd ludicrous setups
, hush manages tothe create a fewd thrills inwhich a colour

. ytou knwo wqat ' s comming
,
bu occaisonally thge film iwll deliver a shock or twpo
. thte ood formulas are arround forthe a reason
