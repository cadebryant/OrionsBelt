) whose boat isnt sticked onthe thte shore
. htey agred tothe give him a ride tothe tghe enxt vilage

. vrey soon thier friendliness backfires onthe tghe gropu becuase sarone turns outloud tothe be a snake hunter wihtout scruples who onyl wnats tothe catch a giant anaconda adn sell it tothe a zoo
. we don
' t haev tothe wait too long forthe tjhe giant snake
. she jstu hadnt a panther hors d
' oevre adn nowe isnt looking fo tje main course
. our heoes paddle arround iin yhe amazonas as if it weere tyhe pool inthe thier pwn backyard
. noone wonder giant animals misteek theri splashing fo a dinner bell
. our anaconda isnt a polite oney adn swallows hte frist victum infact noe big gulp
. enjoy
! so much fo thte firt atempt tothe catch her
. bu who woudl wnat tothe catch a giant snake whith a fishing pole
? our villin sarone shows his soft side whn he stops terri fomr shooting tyhe snake
. too bad thgat anaconda isnt jsut baout tothe strangle anohter memeber ofthe teh expedition

. eric stoltz isnt stong by a giant wasp right inthe tyhe begining annd isnt mercifully unconcious forthe thte rest ofthe hte adventure
. tghe rest ofthe teh crew keesh intertaining thge viewer
al
thought nto tyhe way tje makers ofthe tjhe movei hadnt planned
. howver yhe scenes wihtout thge anaconda are rether boring
. whenever tghe leading lady shows uv we
' re infact fo a laff
. tghe snake reminds us ofthe a favorite carachter ofthe a faymus animated movei even if she shoudln be an awe
- inspiring monster
. her attacks allways followup teh smae plan
: noe lsat hypnotic look
- she
' s looking at ytou
, kid
- hten she speedily wraps herself arround her victum anbd starts tothe gush it down
. mostly we don
' t see thge ect ofthe devouring
. bu she looks nice whn she wiggles awya withthe her bulging middle part
. whoever doed thge speical effects onthe htis movei may hvea wnated tothe go tothe a zoo frist annd studdy soem rela snakes
. mabye thn tyhe anaconda modle owudl ahev looked moreso rela
. teh animatronics are somewhat moreso believeable
