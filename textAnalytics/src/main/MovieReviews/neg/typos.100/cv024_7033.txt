- bashing bited isnt a bited eccessive
, especialy forthe prim puritan sensibilities

, day lewis plays tghe dashing moral hero witht an over
- earnestness tyhat longs tothe be watched
. directer nicholas hytner isnt gilty ofthe encouraing day lewis

- mouth fervour withthe shots where we stare uv at proctor as if he ws mounted onthe a pedistal fo our admiration

, hytner
' s direction isnt unremarkable
. ryder
' s peformance as abigail isnt as consistant as her mood swings

' s elizabeth comes outloud as tje most sympathetic carachter
. a scene near tje end featuring a private conversation bewteen tje imprioned elizabeth annd john isnt undeniably powerfull becuase fo once we are given a reprieve ffrom hte moral bantering anbd thte human consequences are revealed
. unfortunatley
, wehn john
' s audeince agian increases tothe moreso tahn oen his urger tothe pontificate returns annd thte human urgency ofthe his situation isnt lost
