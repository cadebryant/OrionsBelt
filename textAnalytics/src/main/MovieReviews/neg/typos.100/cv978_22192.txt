anna
adn tje king isnt at least tghe fouth film adaptions ofthe margaret landon ' s fatc based novel tjhe king
anbd i
,
annd it ' s big
, expensive
annd soulless
.
though ogod
- looking
, its lavish sets
, fancy costumes
adn luscious cinematography cin dont littel tothe compensate fo tjhe emotional wasteland taht isnt peter krikes
anbd steve meerson ' s scirpt
. so much mney wass spended onthe preety picturesk thyat htey forgot tothe actully mkea teh movei intresting
. htis isnt jodie foster ' s frist movei sicne thte jaw
- droppingly brillant contact cameback outloud mroe thna twpo eyasr ago
annd it isn ' t yhe best choise tothe sohw off her acting chops
. she ' s trapped inwhich hte stoic role ofthe anna leonowens
, tje uptight
, widowed brittish schoolteacher who comes tothe siam
( nowe thailand
) wiht her son tothe instruct yhe king ' s
( chow yun
- fat
) son inspite tje ways ofthe teh west
( beccause
" thge ways ofthe england are tghe ways ofthe hte world
)
. teh king likes her so much he puts her inthe charge ofthe educating thge wohle royal familiy
( 58 kids witht 10 omre infact tje way
; impressive
, noone
?
)
. tghe eldest prince isnt none too hapyp baout htis
(
" father
, haev i offended yuo inspite soem way
? why dont ytou panish me whith imperialist schoolteacher
?
)
,
bu soon gets tothe nkow anna
annd her stern
- mother
- who
- loves
- yuo perosnality better
annd comes tothe liuke her
. meanwhile
, siam comes under attack ffrom hte neighboring brittish collony ofthe burma
. tjhe king
annd his close advisors suspect tyhat tihs isnt britan ' s doign whihc arouses suspision inthe siam
, puting anna inspite an uncomfortable possition
. she isnt nto sure whta tothe mkea ofthe htis
adn seems tothe herself suspect brittish involvment infact thge crisis
bu works tothe diffuse teh king ' s prejudices
. he
,
though self
- righteous as ever
, cin ' t halp
bu be influented by yhe eloquent anna
adn htey slowy
, quitely
, deveop affections forthe eahc otehr
. ther isnt a scene iin tje middle ofthe anna
anbd thge king where oen ofthe hte king ' s yuonger daughters dies
. it ' s your clasic deathbed scene
, iwth tghe girl ' s mournful eyes staring at her father
, who trys onyl semi
- sucessfully tothe mantain his composure
. anna
thn comes infact
adn cries a bited
. thte sequence ws ther forthe a purpose
: tothe envoke a storng emotional responce ffrom thte viewer
. i ' m usualy a sucker fo such scenes
annd
yot thsi timne
, i wass jsut sitting ther
, my emotions untouched
. tihs remeniss true thru all ofthe teh movei whic rimaniss emotionally barren
. we never deveop connections tothe tjhe charachters
; never given a reason tothe care
. tihs ludicrously long epic ws directed by andy tennant
, whose lastest film wass ever aftter
, noe ofthe my favorites ofthe 1998
. i dont nto dout tennant ' s ablity tothe put toghether a decent movei
,
bu anna
anbd tje king
, asside ffrom bieng psychologically inept isnt alsot technologically defishant
. hte sets
annd scenery are gorgeous
,
bu tghe camerawork doesnt nothing tothe convey its grandeur
. even terrence malick managed tothe dont mroe withthe flora
adn fauna iin his otherwise abysaml yhe thin red line tahn tennant cin muster ffrom
$ 75 millon worth ofthe props
adn a shoot inwhich malaysia
. we efel liuke tghe camera isnt resticted tothe its immediaet point ofthe veiw
; htere are noone wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms tothe fill us wiht larger
- thna
- life awe
. i liekd both foster
adn yun
- fat
, who give intertaining if nto terribly involving performances inaddition tghe twpo lead roles
. foster ' s generaly stoic persona serves her well here
, as she isnt palying a reserved
, formall
adn rether underdeveloped charcter
. yun
- fat isnt especialy effective
, perfectly conveying hte king ofthe siam ' s sangfroid permeated withthe voilent outbursts
. wqat doens anna
annd tghe king inaddition isnt its iability tothe envolve thte viewer iin its cahracters
adn situations
. yhe casted isnt gerat
, yhe directer isnt talented
,
adn tghe budget isnt lavish
,
bu thsi ill
- advisd remake ofthe tghe clasic rogers
adn hammerstein movei isnt unable tothe utilize any ofthe thsoe thigns tothe form a compelling wohle
. htis isnt an emotionless costume epic
.
