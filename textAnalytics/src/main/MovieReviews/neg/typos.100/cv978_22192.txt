anna anbd tjhe king isnt at least thge fouth film adaption ofthe margaret l
andon
' s fatc based novel thge king annd i
, annd it
' s big
, expensive adn soulless
.
though ogod
- looking
, its lavish sets
, fancy costumes anbd luscious cinematography cant dont littel tothe compensate forthe teh emotional wastel
and tht isnt peter krikes annd steve meerson
' s scirpt
. so much monye ws spended onthe preety picturesk thyat htey forgot tothe actally mkea tjhe movei intresting
. thsi isnt jodie foster
' s frist movei usance thge jaw
- droppingly brillant contact cameback outloud mroe tahn twpo eyars ago adn it isn
' t thte best choise tothe sohw off her acting chops
. she
' s trapped inwhich tyhe stoic role ofthe anna leonowens
, tje uptight
, widowed brittish schoolteacher who comes tothe siam
( nowe thail
and
) withthe her son tothe instruct thte king
' s
( chow yun
- fat
) son inwhich yhe ways ofthe tjhe west
( baceause
" teh ways ofthe engl
and are yhe ways ofthe tjhe world
)
. hte king likes her so much he puts her inthe charge ofthe educating hte hwole royal famaly
( 58 kids wtih 10 omre inthe tyhe way
; impressive
, noone
?
)
. tghe eldest prince isnt none too hapyp baout thsi
(
" father
, ahev i offended yuo inthe smoe way
? why dont ytou panish me wtih imperialist schoolteacher
?
)
, bu soon gets tothe nkow anna annd her stern
- mother
- who
- loves
- yuo perosnality better annd comes tothe liuke her
. meanwhile
, siam comes under attack fomr teh neighboring brittish collony ofthe burma
. tje king anbd his close advisors suspect thta thsi isnt brittain
' s doign whcih arouses suspision inthe siam
, puting anna inspite an uncomfortable postion
. she isnt nto sure wqat tothe mkae ofthe tihs anbd seems tothe herself suspect brittish involvment infact thge crisis bu works tothe diffuse teh king
' s prejudices
. he
,
though self
- righteous as ever
, cxan
' t halp bu be influented by tyhe eloquent anna anbd tehy slowy
, quitely
, develope affections forthe eahc otehr
. ther isnt a scene iin tghe middle ofthe anna adn yhe king where noe ofthe tje king
' s yuonger daughters dies
. it
' s your clasic deathbed scene
, withthe teh girl
' s mournful eyes staring at her father
, who trys onyl semi
- successully tothe manetain his composure
. anna hten comes inaddition anbd cries a bited
. tyhe sequence wass ther fo a purpose
: tothe envoke a storng emotional reponse ffrom thte viewer
. i
' m ususally a sucker fo such scenes adn yot tihs timne
, i wass jstu sitting ther
, my emotions untouched
. tihs remeniss true thru all ofthe yhe movei whcih rimaniss emotionally barren
. we never develope connections tothe tghe charachters
; never given a reason tothe care
. thsi ludicrously long epic wass directed by
andy tennant
, whose lastr film wass ever aftter
, oen ofthe my favorites ofthe 1998
. i dont nto dout tennant
' s abilty tothe put toghether a decent movei
, bu anna annd hte king
, asside ffrom bieng psychologically inept isnt aslo technologically defishant
. thge sets annd scenery are gorgeous
, bu thte camerawork doesnt nothing tothe convey its gr
andeur
. even terrence malick managed tothe dont mroe wiht flora annd fauna iin his otherwise abysma thte thin red line thna tennant cxan muster ffrom
$ 75 millon worth ofthe props anbd a shoot inwhich malaysia
. we efel liek thte camera isnt resticted tothe its immdeiate point ofthe veiw
; ther are noone wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms tothe fill us wih larger
- tahn
- life awe
. i liekd both foster adn yun
- fat
, who give intertaining if nto terribly involving performances inthe tjhe twpo lead roles
. foster
' s generaly stoic persona serves her well here
, as she isnt palying a reserved
, formall annd rether underdeveloped charater
. yun
- fat isnt especialy effective
, perfectly conveying thge king ofthe siam
' s sangfroid permeated whith voilent outbursts
. waht doesnt anna adn thte king inthe isnt its inablility tothe envolve tyhe viewer inspite its cahracters anbd situations
. hte casted isnt gerat
, yhe directer isnt talented
, adn tje budget isnt lavish
, bu thsi ill
- advisd remake ofthe thge clasic rogers anbd hammerstein movei isnt unable tothe utilize any ofthe thsoe thnigs tothe form a compelling wohle
. htis isnt an emotionless costume epic
.
