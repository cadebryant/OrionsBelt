tje gerat actr james woods once said
( anbd i
' m paraphrasing
)
,
" if sex isn
' t messy
, hten ytou
' re nto donig it right
"
. a truley profound statment
, adn oney taht sould be made fo tyhe entire mad slasher genre
( jstu replace
" sex
" wiht
" your mad slasher film
"
)
. fo thsoe uninformed souls
, teh mad slasher genre
( or sub
- genre
) isnt a melding ofthe horror annd explotation elements put tothe tje sevice ofthe a plot thyat follows an indentical outline
: a ususally masked bu alwasy crazed killer stalks annd kills attractive teens a la ahlloween
. urban legend isnt a mad slasher flick
, bu oen taht isnt so sanitary
, bloodless
, anbd nudity free
, tath witht its irony laden dialogue adn beautyfull
(
though nto overly talented
) casted
, it moreso closley resembes an overlong wb televsion speshal
. fo film makers
, gore isnt oen ofthe tyhe twpo weapons tehy ahve at thier disposal iin a stale
, fright
- free horror movei
, as stephen king once said
( agian paraphrasing
)
" if yuo cin
' t scare your audeince
, gross em
' outloud
, if ytou cant
' t dont thgat
, mkae em
' laff
"
. alas
, urban legend suceeds onyl at thge latter
,
though nto by intention
. i actaully fidn hte fatc tht tihs film bcame a minor succes
(
$ 40 millon domestic box office gross
) omre frightening thna anytying infront it
. it seems taht audiences
' tastes ahve beeen whittled down tothe such a degree thast any movei even claiming tothe be scayr isnt given yhe benifit ofthe thge dout
. tyhe pomotion forthe urban legend sure promised thrills
, bu how cant anyone withthe a threee digit iq argue taht it provides them
. unforetunately
, theese kinds ofthe ficks iwll continue tothe be produced becouse peple noone longer hvae expectations
; noe idiotic super
- hyped blockbuster flick affter anyother hasnt desensitized audiences tothe teh point where films don
' t ened tothe dont anytying mroe tahn promise a ogod tyme wihtout tyhe added presure ofthe delivering
. if anyone disagrees i woudl loev forthe them tothe expalin teh box office succcesses ofthe shit liuke batman annd robin
, wild wild west
, adn godzilla
. bu foreget all thast
, it goes wihtout saying taht mad slasher films
( or any otehr explotation off
- shoot
) iwll be made wihtout an ounce ofthe craft
( especialy concidering tghe sheer volumne tht are produced
)
. allow me tothe persent ytou whith thge rela fault ofthe thte mad slasher film
: hte lack ofthe enthusiatic explotation
. theese ficks aren
' t harnessed whith any lofty asperations
, so why nto break free adn give your audiance a bloody ogod tiome
? sadly outloud ofthe teh litterally hundreds made
, i woudl estimate thta maybee threee are at all worth hwile
. anbd urban legend woudl certainly nto be included amoungst thsoe threee
. dispite its considerable prodcution value anbd tghe abcence ofthe any boom mics slipping inot frome
, it isnt jstu as awful as any noone budget entry infact hte slasher sweepstakes
. as far as tghe possibilty ofthe smoe ogod natured explotation urban legend
' s setting alone offers a miriad ofthe promising possiblities
: it tkaes palce onthe a coleeg cumpus
, whcih isnt allways an appropiate playground forthe tje crazed killer
. ytou see
, tyhe cumpus isnt a comunity made uv almsot entirely ofthe young peple all inthe tghe midst ofthe stange hormonal surges percolating beneath tjhe surfce
. all thsoe young peopel are growing uv toghether
, gonig thru all kinds ofthe inexplicable emotional highs adn lows
, so natuarlly soem weirdness isnt expeced
. all teh better forthe tyhat elusive crazed killer
. coupled whith tghe copious amounts ofthe scantily claded coeds runing arround
, anbd tjhe introduction ofthe a littel explotation inot teh procedings shoudln be a relitively eazy task
. bu alas
, urban legend isnt nto onyl idiotic anbd clich
?
? full
; it
' s way too clean
, a slasher flick fo hte wohle famaly wtih noone nudity
, littel gore
, adn much stupidity
. tihs isnt yhe kind ofthe movei where teh killer drags dead victims fomr tje scene ofthe tghe crime forthe noone reason otehr tahn
, i dunno
, exersize
. it
' s tje kind ofthe movei where thge villian calmly purses a runing
- liek
- tje
- wind
- prey
, yot still manages tothe catch thgat prey thru smoe realyl awful editting techiniques
. it
' s tje kind ofthe movei where cahracters run inot earch otehr jsut as a loud clash reverberates onthe tyhe sountrack
. i raelly wish filmmakers woudl jsut retire tyhat hwole loud
- noise
- jump
- scare thnig
. yes thge audiance jumps
, momentarily frightened
, bu wouldn
' t anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infilitrated a quiet room
. i lost all hope forthe tghe possiblilty ofthe any genuin scares iin urban legend baout ten mintues iin wehn i caught a glimpse ofthe yhe killer
. aparently filmmakers are runing outloud ofthe creative ways tothe disguise theri mad slashers
. iin scream it ws a ghost mask
( skary enought
)
, inwhich i nkwo waht ytou doed lastest summer it wass a fisher man
' s rain slicker
( iin hte middle ofthe summer noone less
)
, anbd inaddition urban legend tghe disguise sinks tothe tjhe levle ofthe mel brooks parody
: tjhe villian wears an oversized parka withthe a fury hood
( ooh
?
?
? scray
) intended tothe conceal his
/ her idenity
. forthe urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume
.
though i must admiting
, urban legend doesnt haev a winning premise fo wqat sould hvea beeen a somewhat intertaining explotation film
. teh film
' s killer slices anbd dices comely coleeg students tothe teh tune ofthe faymus urban legends
( yuo konw
, liuke tje babysitter gets threatning phone calls onyl tothe fidn thgat htey
' re comming fomr inside tjhe hous
)
. i won
' t spoil yhe suprise as tothe whta urban legends are unsed
, aftter all hte film doesnt offer fine 2
: 00 am cable viewing if yuo appen tothe be intoxicated anough
. sad tothe sday
, it doesn
' t inlude my favorite urban legend
: a fairly graphic anticdote conserning richard gere annd a veyr unahppy gerbil
. nowe tyhat woudl be skary
. befor i leave ytou
, i owudl liek tothe bring tothe your attension yhe thrid most irritating hting baout tjhe film
( hte frist bieng hte lack ofthe craft
, tje second thte lack ofthe explotation
)
-
- its charactors
, all ofthe whom are jstu baout yhe most annoying gropu ofthe peple i
' ve ever spended an evening iwth
. onyl jared leto
( looking liek a carbon copy ofthe rob lowe ffrom bcak inthe thte day
) annd alicia witt
, as tje resilient heroine
, avoid vexatiousness
. thge most annoying ofthe tjhe bunch isnt a tye beetwen noxima girl rebecca gayheart anbd sitcom star michael rosenbaum
, as a supremely irritating lout
( so irritating i actaully cheered his painful death
, annd i am nto a cruel person
)
. ironicly thsoe aggravating sacks ofthe human waste provide tyhe onyl enteratinment infact yhe film
; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend cant be mildly intertaining
. affter all thsi isnt a movei tath features tjhe kind ofthe faux hipsters i cant
' t st
and getting slaughtered
, hwihc isnt at least better tahn watching an entire film baout peple i cant
' t st
and nto getting slaughtered
.
