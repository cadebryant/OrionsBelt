my giant isnt twpo movies forthe tjhe price ofthe noe
,
bu niether isnt worth tyhe cost ofthe addmission

) languidly pased thoughout
, tyhe movei becomes increasingly lugubrious as tyhe screenplay by david seltzer
( tje omen
) meanders towrad its sad endig
. usance it ' s rarley funny or convincingly dramtic
, whta yhe filmmakers throught tehy weere donig rimaniss a mistery

annd htis eyar ' s my giant
. oney wonders if he reads tje scirpt befoer agreeing tothe go ahead witht a project
. surelly reading thte oen forthe my giant owudl hvea shown taht ther ws nothing htere
. perhasp he throught he coudl ad lib it inot succes
. or maeby he whants tothe be a dramtic ator
annd throught he sould dont something sereous iwth thte movei ' s somber tone
. tje most charitable hting taht coudl be said baout it isnt thta it isnt so ineffectual tht peple iwll probablly foreget htey saw it by teh enxt day
. htis noe

( teh movei itself konws noone bounds as it containes oney ofthe tje most putrid
annd lenghty vomiting scenes ever
.
) aftter a sories ofthe missed opportunities
, yhe commedic part ofthe teh movei isnt over
,
annd it turns inot a cheap
adn maudlin desease movei
. we leran thast max ' s condidtion isnt terminal

annd he wiull soon dieu
. tothe be fair
, teh movei doens contain a faw ogod scenes
