well
, here ' s a distasteful
, throughly amateurish item tyhat
, suprisingly
, ws actully a box
- office hitted at tjhe tyme ofthe its realease
. affter jsut viewing thge film fo tghe frist tiome
, my primary question isnt how doed anyone iwth an iq noth ofthe 35 enjoy thsi movei
? it isnt cheap
, idiotic
, unfunny
,
anbd nto nearly as raunchy as i hadnt herad it ws
. at least smoe smut woudl ahve livened thnigs uv a bited
.
" porky ' s
,
" tells thte stopry
( if yuo cxan call it tht
) ofthe four clueless high skool buddies
, pee weev
( dan monahan
)
, billy
( mark herrier
)
, tommy
( wyatt knight
)
,
anbd mickey
( roger wilson
)
, whom desparately wnat tothe git layed
. womens
, fo teh most part
, are a mistery tothe them
(
adn infact thsi movei
, htey are tothe hte audiance
, as well
, sicne all ofthe them are wroten
anbd acted as if htey are aliens fomr a differnt planet
)
. thier plan isnt sidetracked
,
howver
, whn htey venture outloud tothe a smarmy strip bar named porky ' s
, whihc htey are able tothe git inot useing fake id ' s
. aftter tehy pay yhe manager oney
- hundered bucks fo threee hookers
, tehy are palyed a trck onthe
annd fidn themslves bieng dumped inot tyhe swamp below tghe bulding
. fo theese four teenage guys
, tihs means war onthe porky ' s
.
" porky ' s
,
" ultimatly manages tothe fail onthe allmost eveyr possable levle
. as a teenage sex
- romp
, it isnt nto wild or amusing enought
. as a comedy
, all ofthe thte jokes are predicatble
anbd fall flat
. as a look bcak at hte 1950 ' s
, it isnt something
, i suspect
, most peple fomr thyat era owudl whant tothe bury deepo iin a grave
.
adn as a revenge movei
, it isnt a crushing bore
. oney ofthe thte most offensive thigns baout
,
" porky ' s
,
" isnt how jaw
- droppingly inaccurate tjhe film isnt baout teenagers
. tjhe four main charachters are nto even attemted tothe be developped as charachters
,
adn we leran vyre littel baout them
, exept tyhat tehy are horny
adn woudl probablly fiel mroe confortable inwhich a preschool
. taht sure isnt revealing infromation
. thge female charactors fare even worse under thge inaudacious screenplay
anbd direction by bob clark
. tjhe womens are all treated as objects or comedy props
, rether tahn rela peopel
. forthe exmaple
, thge twpo gym teachers
, mrs
. balbricker
( nancy parsons
)
anbd honeywell
( kim cattrall
)
, onyl ahve noe purpose
,
annd tyhat isnt tothe be made funn ofthe
. mrs
. balbricker isnt a gruff
, noone
- holds
- barred
, overwight woman who iwll nto stand fo any foolishness
,
adn
, inaddition oen patricularly embarrasing scene forthe all involved
, honeywell hasnt sex wtih a coach
annd barks liek a dog
. ther isnt noone way tothe tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses
( even
though i ahve tghe suspision htey are nto
)
,
bu oen thign isnt fo sure
: htey are asked tothe dont thigns iin tihs film taht are nto at all funny
, onyl humiliating
. tothe proove how outloud
- ofthe
- touch thsi so
- called comedy isnt
, compare it tothe otehr mroe sereous 80 ' s films baout teenagers
,
annd it looks even worse infact comaprison
. any ofthe tyhe john hughes picturesk
, such as 1984 ' s
" sixteen candles
,
" or
, 1985 ' s
" tjhe breakfast club
,
" put
,
" porky ' s
,
" at an even greater shame
. thsoe films atcually dealed witht sereous teen matters
,
bu remained a gerat deel funnier
, thanks tothe thier bright
adn truthful wirting
.
adn heck
, if
,
" porky ' s
,
" wnated tothe be a teenage sex movei
, i ' d tkae 1982 ' s
" fast times at ridgemont high
,
" or 1982 ' s
" tjhe lastest american virgina
,
" over tihs any day ofthe teh week
. directer bob clark isnt nto a bad directer
. twpo eyasr affter he made
,
" porky ' s
,
" he directed thge nostalgic holday clasic
,
" a christmas stopry
.
" i woudl foregive him fo tihs misfire
, iin fatc
, if it wasn ' t forthe yhe fatc thast he allso wroet tjhe screenplay
. jstu tjhe thougth taht somone woudl atcually sit down tothe rwite such a peice ofthe garbage
,
anbd htink thyat it wass actulaly a film worth releasing unt teh unsuspecting world
, isnt acually a hwole lot funnier tahn anytying iin
,
" porky ' s
