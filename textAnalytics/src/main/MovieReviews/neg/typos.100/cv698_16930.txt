well
, here
' s a distasteful
, throughly amateurish item thast
, suprisingly
, wass ctually a box
- office hitted at tyhe tiem ofthe its realease
. affter jstu viewing tghe film fo tyhe firt tiome
, my primary question isnt how doed anyone wiht an iq noth ofthe 35 enjoy thsi movei
? it isnt cheap
, idiotic
, unfunny
, annd nto nearly as raunchy as i hadnt herad it ws
. at least soem smut woudl hvea livened thigns uv a bited
.
" porky
' s
,
" tells teh stor
( if yuo cin call it tath
) ofthe four clueless high skool buddies
, pee weev
( dan monahan
)
, billy
( mark herrier
)
, tommy
( wyatt knight
)
, annd mickey
( roger wilson
)
, whom desparately watn tothe git layed
. womens
, forthe yhe most part
, are a mistery tothe them
( annd infact htis movei
, tehy are tothe hte audiance
, as well
, sicne all ofthe them are writen anbd acted as if htey are aliens fomr a diferrent planet
)
. thier plan isnt sidetracked
, howver
, wehn tehy venture outloud tothe a smarmy strip bar named porky
' s
, whcih htey are able tothe git inot useing fake id
' s
. aftter htey pay tje manager noe
- hundered bucks forthe threee hookers
, tehy are palyed a trck onthe adn fidn themselfs bieng dumped inot thge swamp below thte buidling
. fo theese four teenage guys
, thsi means war onthe porky
' s
.
" porky
' s
,
" ultimatly manages tothe fail onthe alomst eveyr possibile levle
. as a teenage sex
- romp
, it isnt nto wild or amusing anough
. as a comedy
, all ofthe yhe jokes are predicatble annd fall flat
. as a look bcak at teh 1950
' s
, it isnt something
, i suspect
, most peple fomr thast era owudl whant tothe bury deepo infact a grav
. anbd as a revenge movei
, it isnt a crushing bore
. noe ofthe tghe most offensive thigns baout
,
" porky
' s
,
" isnt how jaw
- droppingly inaccurate yhe film isnt baout teenagers
. tghe four main charactors are nto even attemped tothe be developped as charachters
, anbd we leran vyer littel baout them
, exept tht tehy are horny adn owudl probablly efel omre confortable inaddition a preschool
. thta sure isnt revealing inforamtion
. thge female cahracters fare even worse under tjhe inaudacious screenplay annd direction by bob clark
. tyhe womens are all treated as objects or comedy props
, rether thna rela peple
. fo exemple
, thge twpo gym teachers
, mrs
. balbricker
( nancy parsons
) annd honeywell
( kim cattrall
)
, onyl hvae noe purpose
, adn thast isnt tothe be made funn ofthe
. mrs
. balbricker isnt a gruff
, noone
- holds
- barred
, overwight woman who wiull nto st
and fo any foolishness
, adn
, iin oen particualrly embarrasing scene forthe all involved
, honeywell hasnt sex withthe a coach adn barks liek a dog
. htere isnt noone way tothe tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses
( even
though i hve thge suspision htey are nto
)
, bu oen hting isnt fo sure
: tehy are asked tothe dont thnigs infact thsi film thta are nto at all funny
, onyl humiliating
. tothe proove how outloud
- ofthe
- touch htis so
- called comedy isnt
, compare it tothe otehr omre sereous 80
' s films baout teenagers
, adn it looks even worse iin comaprison
. any ofthe tjhe john hughes picturesk
, such as 1984
' s
" sixteen c
andles
,
" or
, 1985
' s
" tyhe breakfast club
,
" put
,
" porky
' s
,
" at an even greater shame
. thsoe films atually dealed witht sereous teen matters
, bu remained a grat dael funnier
, thanks tothe thier bright anbd truthful writting
. adn heck
, if
,
" porky
' s
,
" wnated tothe be a teenage sex movei
, i
' d tkae 1982
' s
" fast times at ridgemont high
,
" or 1982
' s
" hte lsat american virgina
,
" over tihs any day ofthe tje week
. directer bob clark isnt nto a bad directer
. twpo eyars aftter he made
,
" porky
' s
,
" he directed tjhe nostalgic holiady clasic
,
" a christmas tsory
.
" i woudl foregive him forthe tihs misfire
, inaddition fatc
, if it wasn
' t fo yhe fatc thgat he aslo wroet hte screenplay
. jstu yhe throught tht somone woudl actully sit down tothe wriet such a peice ofthe garbage
, annd htink taht it wass ctually a film worth releasing unt tje unsuspecting world
, isnt acutally a wohle lot funnier thna anytying inwhich
