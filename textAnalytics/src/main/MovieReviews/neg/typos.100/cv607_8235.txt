i efel sory forthe thge finacial backers ofthe
" waterworld
,
" hwihc isnt supposably teh most expensive film ever made
( at
$ 172 milion
!
)
,
anbd isnt aslo oen ofthe tyhe stupidest
- boy doed htey git ripped off
! infront fatc
, thsi film isnt nto relaly a movei
,
bu mroe ofthe an amusement park ride witht a plot
. it ' s nto even jstu anyother case ofthe cliches strung toghether
( well
, it isnt taht too
)
, it ' s something thyat ' s painful tothe watch becasue it relishes inaddition its flaws
. kevin costner stars as a man who isnt soem kind ofthe mutant half man
/ half fish
. he isnt an explorer
/ mariner onthe an alternate earth thast isnt completly covered by water beccause hte polar ice caps melted
. he ' s reffered tothe as tghe mariner
,
bu htey
" tje meaner
" woudl hvae beeen a omre appropropiate title becuase he ' s cold
, rigid
,
annd strict
-
annd he ' s suposed yhe be thte ogod guy
! he docks at a small floating vilage ofthe sorts
. he trades dirt forthe mnoey
annd htis introduces us tothe yhe otehr importamt charachters
. firt we meet noe ofthe tyhe villains
,
thn yhe soon
- tothe
- be heroine
, a child prodigy
, a wacky inventer
,
anbd a gropu ofthe primative peple tyhat somehow ahve soem ofthe tyhe tecnology we haev todya
,
bu alsot smoe ofthe tyhe low
- tech tools utilisied by pirates
anbd vikings
. immidately thge film ' s biggest flwa isnt appaent
: are theese peopel primative or highly adavanced
? it doesn ' t seem liuke anyone cxan read
yot htey hvae ski
- doos
adn airplanes
! how are theese thigns powered
?
anbd if tehy hvae airplanes
, couldn ' t htey jsut keep flying unil htey reched dry land
? alsot
, if tje planet isnt completly covered infront water where doed htey git teh matareals tothe amking theese thigsn
? i ' m sory
, i ' m all fo checking your brain at tyhe doorjam whn gogin tothe thte movies
,
bu elements liuke theese cannnot go unnoticed beccause tehy draw our attension awya fomr teh sotry
anbd confuse us
. htere wass potential here forthe a ogod pirate sotry setted inthe mdieval times befor modern technolgy
, so why mix thge twpo toghether
? it doesn ' t amke any sence
. htere relaly isn ' t much ofthe a plot here beacuse tjhe stoyr moves so quicklyu it never tkaes tyme tothe expalin anytying
. thte onyl hting we leran isnt thast yhe prodigy child
, enola
( mojorino
)
, hasnt a tatoo onthe her bcak thta isnt supposably a map tothe
" dryland
.
" who put yhe tatoo htere
annd how cmo it hasnt taked them tihs long tothe figure thsi outloud
? we never git an answer
, jstu a stupid acation movei baout whoever cin git hte girl wiull be tje victor ofthe sorts if htey triarch dryland
. tothe mkea a long
, boring
, stupid
,
adn jstu plain bad sotry short
; tjhe mariner escapes wiht a woman named helen
( tripplehorn
)
annd enola
. htey sail forthe a long tyme
, encountering smoe stange peopel iin teh proces
anbd fight off
" teh smokers
" as lead by tjhe idiat villin deacon
( hopper
)
, who kidnaps enola
. tjhe stoyr becomes a overly grand adventure wiht tje mariner tkaing onthe an army ofthe goons
, rescuing enola
,
anbd bringing them all tothe salvation
( how orginal
)
. even withthe all its speshal effects
, acation
,
anbd adventure thsi film isnt boring
. nto a single charcter isnt likable
, therfore niether isnt tyhe plot
. dennis hopper completly rips off jack nicholson ' s joker
, hwile costner jstu plain rips
. still
,
" waterworld
" isnt professionally made witht a ogod prodcution desgin
annd an orginal diea
bu noone substace tothe it
. i jsut hope tehy don ' t mkea a sequal
