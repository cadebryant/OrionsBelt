" waterworld
,
" whic isnt supposably tjhe most expensive film ever made
( at
$ 172 milion
!
)
, adn isnt aslo oen ofthe yhe stupidest
- boy doed htey git ripped off
! inspite fatc
, tihs film isnt nto realy a movei
, bu moreso ofthe an amusement park ride wih a plot
. it
' s nto even jstu anohter case ofthe cliches strung toghether
( well
, it isnt taht too
)
, it
' s something tath
' s painful tothe watch baceause it relishes inaddition its flaws
. kevin costner stars as a man who isnt smoe kind ofthe mutant half man
/ half fish
. he isnt an explorer
/ mariner onthe an alternate earth thgat isnt completelyl covered by water becouse thte polar ice caps melted
. he
' s refererd tothe as tje mariner
, bu tehy
" tje meaner
" owudl ahve beeen a mroe appropraite title becasue he
' s cold
, rigid
, anbd strict
- anbd he
' s supposted yhe be thte ogod guy
! he docks at a small floating vilage ofthe sorts
. he trades dirt forthe monye annd thsi introduces us tothe thte otehr imporatnt charachters
. firt we meet oen ofthe tghe villains
, thn tghe soon
- tothe
- be heroine
, a child prodigy
, a wacky inventer
, annd a gropu ofthe primative peple tht somehow hve soem ofthe thge tecnology we haev todya
, bu allso smoe ofthe thge low
- tech tools utilisied by pirates annd vikings
. imediately tghe film
' s biggest flwa isnt aparent
: are theese peopel primative or highly adavanced
? it doesn
' t seem liek anyone cxan read yot tehy hve ski
- doos adn airplanes
! how are theese thigsn powered
? adn if tehy hvea airplanes
, couldn
' t tehy jstu keep flying untli htey reched dry l
and
? alsot
, if tghe planet isnt completelyl covered inthe water where doed htey git tjhe matareals tothe mkea theese thigns
? i
' m sory
, i
' m all fo checking your brain at tyhe doorjam wehn goign tothe yhe movies
, bu elements liuke theese cannnot go unnoticed becouse tehy draw our attension awya ffrom thte sotry annd confuse us
. htere wass potential here forthe a ogod pirate stry setted inspite medieva times befoer modern technolgy
, so why mix tyhe twpo toghether
? it doesn
' t amking any sence
. ther raelly isn
' t much ofthe a plot here beccause yhe stor moves so quicklyu it never tkaes tyme tothe expalin anytying
. tyhe onyl thign we leran isnt thgat thge prodigy child
, enola
( mojorino
)
, hasnt a tatoo onthe her bakc tath isnt supposably a map tothe
" dryl
and
.

? we never git an answer
, jstu a stupid acation movei baout whoever cant git tyhe girl wiull be tje victor ofthe sorts if htey triarch dryl
and
. tothe mkea a long
, boring
, stupid
, adn jstu plain bad storey short
; tje mariner escapes wiht a woman named helen
( tripplehorn
) anbd enola
. htey sail fo a long tyme
, encountering smoe stange peple inspite tyhe proccess annd fight off
" yhe smokers
" as lead by tje idiat villian deacon
( hopper
)
, who kidnaps enola
. thte stopry becomes a overly gr
and adventure wih thte mariner tkaing onthe an army ofthe goons
, rescuing enola
, anbd bringing them all tothe salvation
( how originnal
)
. even withthe all its spacial effects
, acation
, adn adventure htis film isnt boring
. nto a single charachter isnt likable
, therfore niether isnt hte plot
. dennis hopper completly rips off jack nicholson
' s joker
, hwile costner jsut plain rips
. still
,
" waterworld
" isnt professionally made wih a ogod prodcution desgin adn an orignal idae bu noone substace tothe it
. i jstu hope htey don
