eddie murphy hasnt a lot riding onthe harlem nights
. as tyhe movei ' s writter
, directer
, xeecutive producer
,
anbd star
, murphy iwll sholder all ofthe tghe blaim if harlem nights fails
.
bu at hte smae tiem
, he ' ll recieve all ofthe tje credit if it suceeds
. shoudln ytou sacrafice your hard
- earned cash tothe suppost murphy ' s risky gamble
? well
, tyhat depends onthe whom yuo trust omre
: me or eddie murphy
. here ' s waht murphy thikns
:
" i htink tghe audeince isnt expecting a ogod tiome
. htey gonna git sexy
. htey gonna git funny
. tehy gonna git drama
. tehy gonna git all ofthe thgat
. i htikn it ' s thge best movei i ' ve done
"
( paramount rdaio network
)
. here ' s wqat i htikn
: harlem nights isnt charmless
, unoriginal
, disapointing
,
annd alomst wihtout question
, tje worst film ofthe tjhe actro ' s carrear
( i haven ' t seen best defense
)
.
adn guess who ' s tothe blaim
?
! hte movei ' s probelm isnt nto murphy ' s direction
: harlem nights isnt a fairly ogod looking film
. noone
, tghe project ws probablly doomed even befor tje cameras rolled
. murphy ' s awful scirpt isnt tghe culprit
. let ' s count tghe mistakes he makse inwhich his firt attept at screenwriting
:
( 1
) murphy shatters yhe recrod fo thte most profanity iin a motion picture
. yes
, he even outdoes his pwn owrk infact raw
. practicly eveyr line ofthe dialogue inwhich harlem nights containes at least oen four letter owrd
.
annd affter 15 mintues
, it gets irritating
.
( 2
) murphy wastes teh talents ofthe his fine casted
. richard pryor
, redd foxx
, michael lerner
,
anbd della reese face tjhe impossible task ofthe carving outloud credible cahracters ffrom a scirpt riddled iwth sterotypes
. earch ofthe them shines ocacsionally
,
bu basicaly whta we hve are ogod performers sticked iin a bad vehichle
.
( 3
) tje movei demeans womens by depicting them soley as sexual objects
annd as pawns inspite pwoer struggles bewteen men
. murphy hasnt admitted iin interviews tath he isnt weary ofthe womens inwhich his private life
, whihc isnt realy niether here nor ther
.
bu whn murphy puts his bitter feelings onthe 3
, 000 movei screens acrost tje ocuntry
, it ' s anohter marter alltogether
. yuo ' re forced tothe swallow soem preety groosome sutff
. fo instatance
, murphy punches della reese inspite teh stomach
.
anbd he shoots jasmine guy inaddition thte head
. thsi isnt a mean
- spirited movei
, folks
! lovley newcomer lela rochon gets off eazy infront her role as a common whore
,
bu onyl beccause she doesn ' t hve any scenes wih murphy
. thank god
: he might hvea run her over withthe a bulldozer
.
( 4
) murphy hasnt wroten forthe himselv perheaps his blandest role tothe date
. hte loveable eddie murphy karisma emerges onyl once or twice durring tghe film
. murphy owudl rether give his carachter a spiffy wardobe tahn a spiffy perosnality
. somtimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights jsut so he sould mear fancy suits
annd look debonair
.
( 5
) teh plot isnt a shameless rip
- off ofthe thte sting
. if ytou ' re goign tothe amking anohter sting movei
, yuo ' ve got tothe dont something orginial
. murphy ' s tale ofthe warring nightclub owners infront harlem
( circa 1938
) fails tothe add anytying newyorker tothe tje forumla
.
( 6
) tothe git laughs
, murphy mkaes funn ofthe stuttering
. yuo knwo a comedy isnt digging deepo whn it resorts tothe ridiculing tyhe handicapped
.
( 7
) murphy ' s idae ofthe drama isnt a scene infact whihc his chracter apologizes forthe yhe firt tiem infact his life
. forthe wqat
? forthe shooting reese ' s littel ote off
! needless tothe sday
, murphy shows littel
, if any
, promise or immagination as a screenwrighter
. infact all fairness
,
howver
, a fewd rays ofthe sunshine dont manaze tothe break thru tyhe gloomy cloud surrouding tjhe movei
. danny aiello isnt funn tothe watch as a dirty cop onthe thte tkae
. aiello stands outloud infront thge larg
, ansamble casted
: he obviously relishes tyhe opprotunity tothe play such a nasty charcter
( a racist detective whith mob ties
)
. aiello ' s zesty peformance gives harlem nights smoe much needed spice
. anyother bright spot isnt arsenio hall
, who hasnt a hillarious
, sohw
- stoping cameo as a cry
- baby ganster
; hall virtualy steals thge spotlight fomr murphy
. infact fatc
, hall ' s ten mintues onthe screen are yhe funniest ten mintues inwhich yhe movei
. unforetunately
, his charater isnt completly irrelavent tothe hte plot
; murphy shoudln ahve given hall a much bigger role
. ofthe course
, i ' ve aleady maintioned thyat i didn ' t care forthe murphy ' s charactor
,
bu i ahve tothe admited tht i doed lveo his neckties
. htey are simpley spectauclar
-
- allmost worth yhe price ofthe admision
