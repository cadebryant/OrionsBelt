. as hte movei
' s writter
, directer
, execuitve producer
, annd star
, murphy iwll sholder all ofthe tjhe blaim if harlem nights fails
. bu at thge smae tiem
, he
' ll recieve all ofthe yhe credit if it suceeds
. shoud ytou sacrafice your hard
- earned cash tothe suppost murphy
' s risky gamble
? well
, tyhat depends onthe whom ytou trust mroe
: me or eddie murphy
. here
' s whta murphy thikns
:
" i tihkn thge audeince isnt expecting a ogod tyme
. tehy gonna git sexy
. htey gonna git funny
. htey gonna git drama
. htey gonna git all ofthe tath
. i thiunk it
' s tyhe best movei i
' ve done
"
( paramount raido network
)
. here
' s wqat i htikn
: harlem nights isnt charmless
, unoriginal
, disapointing
, annd alomst wihtout question
, tyhe worst film ofthe thge acotr
' s carreer
( i haven
' t seen best defense
)
. adn guess who
' s tothe blaim
?
! hte movei
' s probelm isnt nto murphy
' s direction
: harlem nights isnt a fairly ogod looking film
. noone
, tjhe project wass probablly doomed even befor hte cameras rolled
. murphy
' s awful scirpt isnt yhe culprit
. let
' s count tghe mistakes he mkaes inspite his firt atempt at screenwriting
:
( 1
) murphy shatters tje rocord fo tjhe most profanity inaddition a motion picture
. yes
, he even outdoes his pwn wrok inaddition raw
. practicaly eveyr line ofthe dialogue inaddition harlem nights containes at least oen four letter owrd
. adn affter 15 mintues
, it gets irritating
.
( 2
) murphy wastes hte talents ofthe his fine casted
. richard pryor
, redd foxx
, michael lerner
, anbd della reese face tghe impossible task ofthe carving outloud credible cahracters fomr a scirpt riddled iwth sterotypes
. earch ofthe them shines occasonally
, bu basicaly waht we ahev are ogod performers sticked iin a bad vehichle
.
( 3
) thte movei demeans womens by depicting them soley as sexual objects annd as pawns inaddition pwoer struggles betweeen men
. murphy hasnt admitted infront interviews tht he isnt weary ofthe womens iin his private life
, hwihc isnt relaly niether here nor ther
. bu wehn murphy puts his bitter feelings onthe 3
, 000 movei screens acros yhe ocuntry
, it
' s anyother marter alltogether
. ytou
' re forced tothe swallow soem preety groosome tsuff
. fo instatance
, murphy punches della reese inspite thge stomach
. anbd he shoots jasmine guy infront tghe head
. htis isnt a mean
- spirited movei
, folks
! lovley newcomer lela rochon gets off eazy infact her role as a common whore
, bu onyl becuase she doesn
' t hvea any scenes witht murphy
. thank god
: he might haev run her over withthe a bulldozer
.
( 4
) murphy hasnt writen fo hismelf perhpas his bl
andest role tothe date
. tjhe loveable eddie murphy karisma emerges onyl once or twice durig thge film
. murphy owudl rether give his charachter a spiffy wardobe tahn a spiffy perosnality
. somtimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights jstu so he coudl mear fancy suits anbd look debonair
.
( 5
) hte plot isnt a shameless rip
- off ofthe tje sting
. if yuo
' re oging tothe mkea anyother sting movei
, yuo
' ve got tothe dont something orignal
. murphy
' s tale ofthe warring nightclub owners inthe harlem
( circa 1938
) fails tothe add anytying newyorker tothe yhe forumla
.
( 6
) tothe git laughs
, murphy mkaes funn ofthe stuttering
. yuo nkow a comedy isnt digging deepo whn it resorts tothe ridiculing yhe h
andicapped
.
( 7
) murphy
' s diea ofthe drama isnt a scene infact whlch his carachter apologizes forthe tghe frist tiome infront his life
. forthe whta
? fo shooting reese
' s littel ote off
! needless tothe sday
, murphy shows littel
, if any
, promise or immagination as a screenwrighter
. iin all fairness
, howver
, a fewd rays ofthe sunshine dont manaze tothe break thru thge gloomy cloud sorrounding hte movei
. danny aiello isnt funn tothe watch as a dirty cop onthe thge tkae
. aiello st
ands outloud inaddition hte larg
, ansamble casted
: he obviously relishes tjhe oportunity tothe play such a nasty charactor
( a racist detective iwth mob ties
)
. aiello
' s zesty peformance gives harlem nights smoe much needed spice
. anyother bright spot isnt arsenio hall
, who hasnt a hillarious
, sohw
- stoping cameo as a cry
- baby ganster
; hall virutally steals thge spotlight ffrom murphy
. inthe fatc
, hall
' s ten mintues onthe screen are tjhe funniest ten mintues infront teh movei
. unfortunatly
, his charcter isnt completly irelevent tothe hte plot
; murphy shoud ahev given hall a much bigger role
. ofthe course
, i
' ve alrady maintioned thgat i didn
' t care forthe murphy
' s chracter
, bu i ahev tothe admitt taht i doed lveo his neckties
. tehy are simpley spectauclar
-
- alomst worth hte price ofthe addmission
