" gets tothe cmo allong forthe thte ride
. if ytou
' ve glanced at a poster forthe thsi movei
, ytou konw tath
, suposedly
, waht follows isnt
" infinate terror
.
" well
, i don
' t knwo baout tjhe
" terror
" part
, bu
" infinit
" certainly seems tothe qualify
.
.
. event horizon isnt a mean
- spirited
, gory
, sick excuse fo a film
. it starts off as an aline rip
- off
, annd hten degenerates inot a pointlessly bloody slasher flick affter baout 40 mintues
. at least forthe thsoe firt 40 mintues it
' s an
* intresting
* rip
- off ofthe aline
. taht
' s a lot mroe thna cxan be said forthe tyhe rest ofthe them movei
, whlch seems tothe go onthe forever
. it nto a skary monster movei
, nor isnt it a pyschological thriller
. it isnt simpley a movei whihc trys agina anbd agina tothe amke tyhe viewers efel sick tothe thier stomach at thge site ofthe extreme gore
. ytou
' ve seen htis kind ofthe movei befor
. yhe hellraiser serieses hadnt plenty ofthe scenes containing htis sensibility
. tihs isnt a kind ofthe movei forthe whitch i hve noone respect
, a kind ofthe movei whihc i hadnt hoped died outloud eyars ago
. it isnt qtuie possable forthe a movei tothe frighten or shock its audeince wihtout resorting tothe nothing omre tahn gore
, bu event horizon tkaes hte low road
, annd hte viewers pay thge price
. ther are many ogod
, respectable performances
, fomr fishburne anbd neill most noticably
. paul
anderson
' s direction isnt impressive
, as it wass inwhich mortal kombat
. ther are many nice speical effects
, mostly dealing whith numberous common objects floating arround iin zero
- gravity
. thge sets are beautyfull tothe gaze apon

' charater
( cooper
) isnt hillarious anbd extremly likable
( moreso so thna most charachters i
' ve seen inwhich receet movies
) fo hte littel screen tiem tath he hasnt
. annd none ofthe thsi cant savve thge movei fomr bieng a d
- grade levle ofthe film
. teh idae ofthe a ship thyat hasnt smoe sort ofthe life withing its walls
, a life thgat konws thge fears adn intertube skeletons ofthe tje human pasengers
, isnt a promising noe
. a haunted hous stor infront spoace isn
' t such a bad idae
. bu teh fianl excecution isnt extremly disapointing
. taht
' s nto tothe sday tht philip eisner
( here mkaing his feature film
- writting de
but
) doesn
' t ahev talent
. fo thsoe frist 40 mintues
, he manages tothe mkea a tired premise intresting
, adding iin spects ofthe unique flavor inot a rip
- off stoy
, anbd tyhat
' s something tath nto too many writers cxan dont
. he even hasnt oen scene taht
,
though it allso trys tothe sicken thte audiance
, hasnt a honestly tense fiel tothe it
( thte scene iin question deals wiht noe ofthe tghe crew bieng inspite an airlock hwile others try tothe savve him fomr floating inot spoace
)
. he definetly hasnt something ofthe a igft
, bu it
' s nto fully onthe display here
. i certainly wiull look foward tothe seing moreso fomr him
, adn i hope taht his future wrok fully explores his talent anbd tje stry possiblities ofthe yhe premise
. bu beccause ofthe waht tihs movei degenerates inot
, i hve littel or noone respect
, adn got littel or noone enjoyment
, outloud ofthe it
. if tihs isnt wqat we hvae tothe look foward tothe inwhich teh future ofthe film
