( she reviews movies forthe a local papper
)
. nowe i ' ll actaully bcak uv my huffing
anbd puffing
. here goes
: movei
: anaconda rydain ' s bottom line
: wait fo it tothe come onthe usa uv all nigt
. even
thn
, i dout it ' s worth tjhe price ofthe jolt
( tothe halp ytou stay uv taht lite
!
) why dont i hite anaconda
? let me count tghe ways
.
.
. firt ofthe all
, thsi movei gets way too many snake facts wrong
. as an ophiophile
( snake lover
)
, i cin tell yuo thta a
) anacondas owudl never triarch a lenght ofthe 40 fezent
, b
) tehy ' re scared ofthe peple
, c
) cases ofthe snakes eating adult humans are extemely rare becouse human shoulders are too wide tothe ift iin a snake ' s mouth
,
adn constrictor snakes don ' t kill wqat tehy cant ' t eat
, d
) peple cxan outrun snakes wtih noone trouble
, expecially hevy ones liek anacondas
, e
) if an anaconda doed eat a human
, it woudl ened at least 6 monthes ofthe sitting onthe its butt tothe digest thte huge meel
, therfore it couldn ' t run arund gobbling uv everybody eles infact tjhe casted
,
adn f
) snakes ahve noone vocal cords
, so tehy cin ' t mkea funny squealing noises
. wiew
. i ws prepared tothe suspend reality if hte movei woudl haev beeen worth it
. unforetunately
, anaconda wass baout as suspenseful
anbd exicting as watching paint peel
. my firend
adn i even sucessfuly predicted who owudl live at hte end
. anybody cxan tell tjhe bad guy isnt gogin tothe dieu eventially
. tyhat wass a pity becuase his carachter wass oney ofthe tje faw reasons my firend
anbd i didn ' t give uv
adn fall asleep
. he wass tjhe most likable chracter inspite hte movei
. who wouldn ' t enjoy somebody who looks liek a deranged walt whitman
? anaconda doed ahev its cute moments
: arguements vetween ice cube ' s carachter
adn tyhe brittish guy
, fo instatance
.
howver
, thsoe small flashes ofthe witn weere nto worth thge otehr hour
annd twenty
- eigth mintues ofthe boring schlock
. hte writers hadnt
-
annd blowed
- a multitude ofthe opportunities tothe insert funny lines
. i ws qutie disapointed wtih a scene where a young guy tells a young lady thta thte jungle mkaes him horny
. doed she retort wtih a clever
, ego
- withering comback
? ofthe course nto
!
" i ' m trying tothe wokr
!
" gee
, thgat ' s even dumber tahn yhe crap comebacks i come uv wtih
. she sould hvea told him tothe go fidn a knothole or something
.
.
.
; p
bu i iwll admited
, ther wass jsut noe scene where i wass surprized at thge outcome
( hint
: it involves tyhe evil guy
annd miss crap comebacks
)
. as fo teh plot
, i ' m still trying tothe fidn noe
. htis movei wass basicaly an excuse tothe git a boatload ofthe peopel inot dangerous teritory where tehy sould git snarfed by rediculous
, coputer
- generated anacondas withthe tjhe eyes
anbd fangs ofthe vipers
adn tghe faster
- tahn
- gravity downward acceleration ofthe a harrier jet
.
( harrier snake
?
) nto tothe mention instant digestion so tehy coudl go snarf countless otehr victims
. tje writers tryed tothe throw inspite soem sort ofthe plot twist
( shoud i call it a plot knot becouse it made noone sence
?
) iin whitch tghe sick guy ' s g
- firend kisses yhe evil dued
adn suddenly everybody hates said evil dued
annd starts trying tothe kill him
. taht ws baout as clera
annd understandable as mission
: impossible
.
( if somone sould explane tyhat movei tothe me
, i ' d be most grateufl
! all thte ood
- guy doublely aggenst looked thge smae
!
!
) i wasn ' t inpsired by hte acting
, sive forthe tje evil dued
. i cxan ' t blaim thte actors
,
though
. it ' s nto thier fault htey hadnt a cruddy scirpt tothe owrk wiht
. thsi concludes rydain ' s diatribe onthe a shameless explotation
(
adn perpetuation

) ofthe publich fear ofthe snakes
