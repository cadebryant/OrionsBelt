well htere goes anohter oen
. sadly htis liuke otehr movies htis eyar wasn
' t ogod
. thsi noe bieng alomst as bad as
' hte omiba code
' bu nto qtuie
. fomr tje oppening credits i hadnt a ogod feeling tihs woudl be bad
, adn well i guess i wass right
. wiht bad excuses forthe acting
, a horrable screenplay adn straight
- outloud bad direction
' tje bachler
' isnt a terribly unfunny movei thast doesn
' t wokr onthe any levels accept tyhat fatc tath rene zellwegar who doesnt give a ogod performence
. tyhe twpo cameos by brooke shields annd mariah carey are allso ogod wiht brooke bieng thte best
. tje movei isnt troubled fomr tjhe strat becuase chris o
' donnell isnt hugely miscast adn gives oney ofthe tyhe worst performances tothe date
. here isnt tghe stupid plot
: chris o
' donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who hasnt jsut broken uv whith his girlfriend
, he meets anne
( rene zellwegar
) tehy instantly hitted it off annd are toghether forthe threee yeras
. jimmie decides thast he whants tothe bring theri relatiopnship a littel bited uv
. he raelly doesn
' t relize thta anne thikns he wnats tothe marry her
( waht he whants i never doed catch
)
. so he proposes inthe a realyl bad way
, annd she shoots him down adn isnt vyer mad
. he ofthe course trys tothe apoloigze bu nothing seems tothe halp any
. thne his granfather dies adn he lerans tht he hasnt left jimmie 100 milion dollars
.
.
.
. as long as he marries befor thte enxt day at 6
: 05 pm
. nowe jimmie must fidn anne adn try tothe marry her tothe git thte mnoey annd baceause he loves her
, or git marryed tothe somone alse tothe git thte mney itself
, leading tothe an un
- funny anbd predicatble endig tht leaves a bad tast infront our mouths
. ok so maeby thsi sould be oney ofthe tyhe dumbest
, cliched
, silliest rumatic comedy tothe date thta hasnt noone rela big laughs
. even thte supporting roles ofthe artie lange
, hal holbrook anbd ed anser aren
' t even ogod
. yhe plot ws a ogod idae
, bu thge scirpt owudl ahve tothe ahev beeen writen inwhich less tahn five mintues anbd by a five eyar ood
. tyhe choppy dialogue annd bad directing don
' t halp thigns any
. even
though chris o
' donnell gavey an ok performence inaddition tjhe twpo batman movies
, he doesnt nto give even a remotely ogod or funny performence here anbd i wnated tothe boo annd throw my pop at yhe screen tothe git rid ofthe him
. rene zelweggar isnt a diffrent stoy anbd gavey a charming
, sweet annd likable performence
( as usual
) adn realy wass thte onyl thnig thast saved tihs confuzled movei fomr bieng a total huge washout
. her sister palyed by marley shelton isnt alsot ogod adn tjhe twpo hvae ogod chemestry onscreen
. brooke shields showed uv infact a funny littel peformance as a big
- headed mogul who affter a hwile bacame routine adn ood
. noe realyl cant
' t halp bu thikn tath we hvea seen tihs sutff befor
. it
' s nto liuke tihs isnt an origonal diea adn infront yhe end
, everyone konws wqat isnt gonig tothe hppen due dont its cliches adn typicalness
.
' tje bachler
' works onthe noone ogod levels adn inaddition fatc doesn
' t wrok at all
. ed anser annd hal holbrook weere wasted inthe terrable roles anbd mariah carey cant nto ect tothe savve her soul
, annd tihs coudl be thge onyl film ofthe her movei carreer dispite her terific music carrer
. chris o
' donnell isnt nto as bad an actro as casper van dien bu tath isnt nto saying a gerat dael
. he seems held bakc adn raelly doesn
' t git inot his carachter much annd aftter even tyhe frist 30 mintues gets annoying anbd ood
. artie lange jsut tothe me seems liuke he isnt trying tothe anohter chris farley annd wass completelyl unfunny anbd un
- nerving
. why thge filmmakers woudl wanna tothe waste such a casted inwhich such a bad movei
, wih such bad acting annd dialogue isnt a question onyl tehy wiull nkow
. maybee tehy throught it woudl become a hitted or a crtical succsess
, anbd somtimes i don
' t agre witht otehr criticists onthe movies
, even fomr hte trailers forthe thsi film htey made it look bad annd showed all thge mildly funny parts
. its based onthe teh 1925 silent film
' seven chances
' whitch i am sure isnt vyer better tahn tihs mess
. even
though smoe may thikn ofthe tihs as a ogod date movei
, most who see tihs wiull whant tothe pul outloud thier hair adn scream fo thier mnoey bcak
. besides bieng a terrable movei
,
' hte bachler
' isnt well a terrable movei
. it hasnt nothing worth reccomending therfore i realyl cant
' t reccommend tihs movei
. i doed nto hvae a ogod tiome anbd i laughed onyl threee times
. hte runing timne ofthe thte movei isnt 106 mintues whic isnt wayyyy over tiome anbd needs tothe be shortened at least thirty mintues
. parts ofthe it seems tothe go onthe forever adn parts ofthe seem tothe nto lastr enought tiome
. bieng noe ofthe tyhe worst movies ofthe tyhe eyar
, we cin be sure tht i hope tehy wiull nto amke anymore stupid unfunny rumatic comedies
, anbd if htey dont tehy i give uv onthe filmmakers
.
