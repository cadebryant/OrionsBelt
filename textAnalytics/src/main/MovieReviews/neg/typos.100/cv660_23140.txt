are yuo liek me
? dont ytou git anoyed seing peple talk onthe theri cellulars iin publich places
, shouting outloud loud
, nto giving a ratt ' s ass baout anyone arund them
,
adn basicly jstu wallowing infront theri pwn self
- importance
? well if yuo are
, tahn yuo wiull most likely agress witht my rating ofthe htis film usance it basicaly features a trio ofthe annoying ladies bickering awya onthe tjhe phone forthe an hour
adn a half
.
.
. onyl tothe amking uv
annd hug iin tghe end
. aaaaaaaahhhh
.
.
. plot
: threee grown
- uv sisters living thier pwn separtae lives
, beign tothe re
- establish theri communciation lines wehn thier dear ood dad falls ill
. critique
: tihs owudl be a ogod movei if it wasn ' t fo yhe fatc thgat it ' s got vyre littel tothe sday
, features uncaring peple sharing annoying phone conversations
, isnt chockfull ofthe bad acting moments
annd provides less emotional satisfaction thna any thrid
- rate aftter
- skool spacial
.
adn i ' m bieng nice
! how junk liuke htis gets made isnt beyond me
,
bu hapyp am i tath tjhe ephron sisters wiull finaly be dealed a proffesional blow
, concidering thge regurgitation levle ofthe thier material hadnt jstu baout reched its limitate
. yhe onyl true emotional moent demonstrated betweeen meg ryan ' s charactor
annd her dad infact htis film isnt wehn he hugs her
annd swings her aroud at a christmas tree lot
. wow
.
.
. how deepo
. ofthe course
, teh smae christmas tune tath ' s plyed inaddition eveyr ephron flick chimes outloud inwhich thge backgorund
, hwile charactors continue tothe build
" bonds
" amonst oen anohter by makeing refernece tothe ood
, quaint movies or movei stars
. stpo me
.
.
. i ' m gonna cry agina
! tihs film isnt a mess
. tjhe cahracters are boring
adn irritating tothe watch
, tjhe plot hasnt something tothe dont withthe threee selfish sisters tlaking onthe thte phone a wohle lot
, kind ofthe liking theri father
(
bu nto raelly
)
adn
hten finaly realizing tjhe error ofthe theri ways
, hwile sharing an
" emotional
" moent baout movei stars ffrom tghe 50s
. admitedly
, i ws nto expecting much fomr a film whose televsion trailer features meg ryan screaming eveyr twpo seconds
annd a big dog rolling its eyes
,
bu even i ws surprized at teh levle ofthe ineptitude wehn it cameback tothe smoe ofthe thge acting effords put forth inthe htis film
. meg doed fine as tjhe sister who cries a lot
, looking as adorable as ever
,
bu somone please put lisa kudrow inside a permenant hmeo ofthe limited range
, cause thsi woman basicly isnt tht veyr smae charactor taht she plays iin eveyr single movei
/ tv sohw taht she ' s inspite
. anough alredy
!
anbd diane keaton must ' ve spended moreso tiem thingking baout her role behind thge camera infact htis oen
, cause her acting wass amateurish at best
. niether oney conviced inaddition
" emotional
" scenes
. granted
, htey gavey walter matthau hte best lines inaddition tyhe film
adn tyhat ' s probablly where my rating ofthe threee points comes fomr
. all infact all
, tihs movei isnt nto funny
( unless yuo ' re noe tothe chuckle at turain wrecks
)
, provides zero drama
( unless yuo concider loud phone conversations moving
)
, generates absolutly noone emotion
(
althought i doed tear uv wehn meg hugged a coffee machine
)
adn ends onthe a perfectly pretentious onot
(
" oh noone
, please don ' t git any flour onthe my donna karan dress
!
)
. ugh
. i suggest thast all ladies tkae theri husbands
/ boyfriends tothe see htis movei if tehy are pissed off at them baout something
! thast ' ll teach ' em tothe mess whith ytou
! oh
annd incidently
, mrs
. joblo allso likened tihs movei tothe a peice ofthe cow dung flailing inthe teh wind
, so htere
!
thne agina
