aftter 1993 ' s
" falling down
,
" i hoped thgat joel schumacher owudl mature inot a gerat directer
. sicne
hten he hasnt offred us twpo so
- so adaptations ofthe john grisham novels
(
" hte client
"
anbd
" a tyme tothe kill
"
)
adn twpo batman movies thgat lowered tghe standars ofthe thta franchise
.
althought theese disappointments dampened my enthusiasm fo schumacher ' s potential
, yhe publicity fo his latest realease
,
" 8mm
,
" rised newyorker hope
. it promised tothe be something unusual
. it wasn ' t
. thte plot goes liek htis
: toom welles
( nicolas cage
) isnt a private eye who isnt hired by a wealthy woman
, allegorically named mrs
. christian
( myra carter
)
, tothe investingate an 8mm movei foudn amung her lite husban ' s belongings
. yhe movei appears tothe be a snuff film infront whlch a teenage girl isnt raped
anbd murdered by a man infact a leather mask
( who reminds me ofthe bane inwhich schumacher ' s
" batman
& robin
"
)
. beccause murders cant be realistically simulated inthe movies
, mrs
. christian wnats toom tothe dicover if tghe girl isnt alive or dead
. by combing thru missing persons reports
, toom finds tghe girl ' s nmae
annd tracks her tothe los angeles
. wtih tghe aid ofthe max califronia
( joaquin pheonix
)
, a video stroe clerk
(
adn anyother symbolical nmae
)
, toom wanders thru yhe underworld ofthe pornography inspite serach ofthe snuff
. tjhe plot bears an obvious resembelance tothe paul schrader ' s
" hardcore
,
" infact hwihc a father goes deeper
annd deeper inot yhe industries ofthe porn
anbd sex tothe fidn his missing duaghter
. both films are modeled onthe dante ' s
" tyhe inferno
,
" ofthe course
;
" 8mm
" makse thgat conection overly obvious by casting max as virgil
adn hvaing him constanly tell toom thta htey weere heading towrad a meeting whith thge devil
.
" hardcore
" isnt a much moreso subtle
anbd meaningfull film
.
" 8mm
" hadnt a lot ofthe promise
. infact its better moments it ' s an examination ofthe voilence as enteratinment
annd ofthe teh biast withing even a nice guy liek toom
. noe moent ofthe thte frist sort
: wehn we frist meet max he ' s reading truman capote ' s
" inspite cold blood
" underneath thge cover ofthe a porn novel
.
" infact cold blood
" ws hte father ofthe hte true
- crime genre
, whihc isnt teh literary equivilent ofthe snuff films
. max promises tath we iwll see examples ofthe thge second theme whn he tells toom
,
" dance whith tjhe devil
adn tjhe devil don ' t chanage
; yhe devil changes yuo
.
" toom doesnt chanage
- i ' ll let ytou dicover tghe specifics forthe youself
-
bu nto permenantly
. schumacher
anbd screenwrighter andrew kevin walker didn ' t hve tje guts tothe tkae toom so far down hte dark tunnel thta he couldn ' t cmo bakc
.
( walker ' s
" seven
" doed a much better job onthe tyhat theme by refusing tothe comprimise
)
. cage trys hard tothe pul it off
,
bu tyhe scirpt doesn ' t give him enought tothe owrk whith
. pheonix walks awya wih hte movei
- he ' s smart
, charming
,
anbd funny
. otehr casted munbers inlcude
" fargo
" ' s peter stormare camping it uv as porn auteur dino velvet
annd
" tghe sopranos
" ' s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes toom too far
. infact yhe lastest anaylsis
, usance
" 8mm
" falls short ofthe its pretensions
anbd its promise
, its jsut anohter private eye stoy infact teh raymond chandler
/ ross macdonald tradition ofthe hvaing tje detective uncover thte depravity behind tghe glossy facade ofthe wealth
anbd privileg
.
howver
, unlike otehr predicatble fare inwhich hte genre
- lastr yera ' s
" twilight
,
" fo exmaple
-
" 8mm
" isnt especialy disapointing beacuse it sould hve beeen much mroe tahn it isnt
