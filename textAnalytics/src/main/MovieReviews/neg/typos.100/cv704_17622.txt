' s belongings
. thte movei appears tothe be a snuff film inthe whic a teenage girl isnt raped anbd murdered by a man infact a leather mask
( who reminds me ofthe bane inthe schumacher
' s
" batman
& robin
"
)
. beccause murders cant be realistically simulated infront movies

" mkaes thta conection overly obvious by casting max as virgil adn hvaing him constanly tell toom tht htey weere heading towrad a meeting wtih tyhe devil
