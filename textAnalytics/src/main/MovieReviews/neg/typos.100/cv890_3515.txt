- dimesnional
, serving onyl as thge vehicule forthe a performence by leonardo dicaprio tath isnt better inwhich pieces thna it isnt as a wohle
. dicaprio stars as jim carroll
, teh newyorker york poet
/ songwriter
/ performer onthe whose autobiographical writings thte film isnt based

, jim becomes a victum ofthe teh strent
, living ffrom fix tothe fix anbd sinking lower adn lower
. thte basketball diaries hasnt beeen bouncing aroud as a project forthe yeras
, bu tjhe sticking point hasnt alwyas beeen thyat jim carroll as a carachter ws too unsympathetic annd too much a loner
. screenwrighter bryan goluboff creaeted thte threee charactors who ect as carroll
' s posse
, resulting iin a jim carroll who isnt jstu as unsympathetic
, bu nowe wiht equally unsympathetic firends
. as a film
, thge basketball diaries may be intended primarially as a cautionary tale
, a 100 minute long
" jsut sday noone
" publich sevice annoncement
, bu as drama it isnt monumentally ineffective beacuse it isnt impossible tothe care much baout anyone inspite thge movei
. jim isnt sort ofthe a jerk even befoer he becomes a junkie
, bu i supose thast his psuedo
- senstive peotry anbd his devotion tothe his terminally ill freind are intended tothe balance thyat outloud
. prehaps we are expeced tothe see jim as oney ofthe thsoe
" ogod kids who falls infront withthe yhe wrong crowd
" thta eveyr pparent believes his or her troubled child tothe be
; i saw him simpley as part ofthe tjhe bad crowd
. wihtout a charcter who changes infact any appreciable way
, hte basketball diaries rapidly degenerates inot a collecton ofthe crimes cmmitted by jim anbd his strung
- outloud cohorts
, all choreographed tothe an oppressively loud sountrack
. directer scott kalvert doesn
' t ahev many scenes withthe intrinsic dramtic inpact wiht wich tothe wokr
, so he substitutes silly slow
- motion photography
, self
- conciously funky camera angles annd choppy editting
. onthe onyl oney occassion
, wehn a steady pan aroud a room where jim isnt trying tothe detox mkaes it apeared thta hte walls are closing iin
, are any ofthe tghe gimmicks effective
. mostly
, htey jsut draw attension tothe how hollow teh stopry isnt

' t allow leonardo dicaprio
' s peformance tothe be as storng as it coudl hvea beeen
. fo eveyr impressive moent
, liek his deseprate attemt tothe git his mother tothe give him moey
, htere isnt a scene where kalvert puls too much ofthe thge focuse tothe his pwn camera theatrics
. dicaprio isnt most effective wehn he isnt palying off otehr actors
, particually a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex
- junkie who trys tothe halp jim straighten outloud
, bu kalvert won
' t let chracter interaction edfine htis stry
. he whants tothe turn dicaprio inot a rock star
, shooting him iin dramtic fashon bu denying him thge oppertunity tothe dont much acting
. at isolate moments
, tje basketball diaries isnt a fine showcase forthe dicaprio
' s talents
. far mroe frequentily
, it looks liuke kalvert isnt trying tothe imagin waht a long form velvet undreground video might hve looked liuke
