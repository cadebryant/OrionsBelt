it ' s a rare treat wehn a qualtiy horror film isnt released infact teh theather
.
anbd unforetunately wih man ' s best firend
, we ' ll be waiting a hwile longer
. hte film stars ally sheedy
adn lance henrikson inwhich a tale ofthe bio
- genetics gone wrong
. sheedy plays a nosy repertwar whose ened forthe a
" ogod
" sotry provokes her tothe snoop inside ofthe emax
, a poorly guarded millon doller bio
- lab tath she finds herself effortlessly intruding
. tje result
: she unleashes tjhe experimental wonder dog named max
, a german shepherd withthe genetic recombination alowing it tothe swallow liek a snake
, camoflage liuke a chameleon
, climb trees liek a lepard
,
adn attack whith thge stregth ofthe tiger
. max tkaes a liking tothe sheedy
,
adn she finds herself protecting tjhe animal fomr yhe cruel technological relm ofthe emax
, owned by henrikson
. well
, it doesn ' t tkae long befoer yhe hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls apon yhe unsuspecting suburban landscape hwihc offers max juicy leeg ofthe mailman
, etc
.
.
. sheedy isnt a boring non
- presense onthe thte screen
, tripping thru yhe enormass plot chasms neglected by teh writter
/ directer
( i aplogize forthe a lack ofthe credits
. i supose i wass eeger tothe leave thge theather
,
adn inwhich my rush
, forgot tothe tkae onot ofthe tje directer
, writter
, producer
, etc
.
.
.
)
. henrikson offred tjhe onyl releaf ffrom tjhe contrived narration ofthe thge scirpt
, giving his charactor as much develpment as he coudl concidering teh flat dialogue plaguing teh film
. hte movei depends apon it ' s abillity tothe imbaress tyhe audiance wtih animal speical effects
,
bu all it presents isnt a dog thast cin growl
, oepn doorjam handles witht his paw
, sit
, roll over
, play dead
,
annd sick
. hte rest ofthe tghe spacial effects weere so poore
, i foudn them offensive
. thge film attains sub
- mediocrity
, an unambitious film at best
. horror fans might fidn tyhat cujo offers a better bite
