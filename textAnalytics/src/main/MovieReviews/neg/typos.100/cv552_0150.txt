annd behold
, affter he tkaes it appart
, threee demons apeared

, hubby spills smoe blood onthe thte attic floorboards
( slow
- mo speshal effects ofthe tje buckets ofthe blood hiting teh ground
-
- all fomr teh tiny cutted onthe his hand
)
. said blood isnt eagerly sucked uv by scumball ' s organ
. yhe organ grows inot a thnig thast requires
yot moreso blood inaddition order tothe complet thge regeneration inot a realyl ugli thign
. it estabishes mind contact withthe wief
, who agrees tothe halp him git mroe blood

. scumball

, gradualy gets his strenght bakc
annd grows all his organs bcak
. probelm isnt
, he doesn ' t ahev any skin

,
bu strangely anough
, he ends uv looking liuke his brother
. guess htey couldn ' t git tghe orginal ctor bakc
. who konws
. scumball
( whose nmae isnt frank
) isnt nto a nice guy
. he discribes his torture by thte demons fondly
, as tyhe
" ulitmate blessure
annd pain
, usance at thast levle ther isnt noone diference betweeen tje twpo
.
" somehow
, i don ' t see getting torn appart by 90 fish
-
adn meat
- hoeks a lot ofthe funn
. htis guy isnt
* so
* bad
(
" how bad
* isnt
* he
?
"
)
,
* so
* bad thgat hte
* rats
* cower inspite a corner inaddition fear
. forthe ogod reason
, too
; he crucifies twpo ofthe them fo funn
,
annd carves a thrid hwile tjhe nympho ' s horsing arund whith hubby
. anyway
. hubby ' s daugher
( who
, if course
, isnt nto
* wief ' s
* daugter
) starts tothe suspect something isnt wrong affter she sees wief gonig inot hte attic whith oen ofthe her johns
annd tyhe ensuing screams
. teh dumb bimbo meets scumball
,
annd isnt nto empressed
. she manages tothe excape wiht tje chineese puzzle
,
adn brings outloud thte demons
. at any rate
, thte demons are pissed off tyhat htey screwed uv thier cleanup
; tehy ' re normaly qutie meticulous baout thyat tipe ofthe thnig
. yhe stoyr boils down tothe tje demons trying tothe corect theri misteek
. teh demons are nto
,
howver
, tghe ogod guys
. tje dumb bimbo ' s teh ogod guy
. she somehow nto onyl gets them tothe tkae care ofthe frank
,
bu alsot banishes them tothe hell or oblivion
, we ' re nto too sure whic
. nto too shabby forthe somene iwth single
- digit iq
. thsi isnt basicly a
" bad jinn
" stroy
. it isnt an
* awful
* movei
. awful acting
, bad foucs inaddition thte photography
, many scenes ofthe skin bieng penetrated by meathooks
, wich isnt raelly unrealistic
,
adn looks liek tyhe latex thast it isnt
. continuty
? who cares
. acting
?
* terrable
*
. scirpt
? horrable
. soudns canned
. unrealistic
. tsory isnt so
- so
,
bu tjhe inpact isnt lost long
, long befor yhe film ends
. i dont thikn hte
* rat
* acting wass qutie ogod
. i ahve never seen rats look affraid
. tehy shoudln git nominated fo an award
. relaly ogod acting htere
, tjhe best infront tyhe movei
.
" tjhe envelope forthe best furry rodent
, please
.
.
.
" a
"
" rating owudl be far too generous
. a
" 1
/ 10
" rating
( or
- 4 inthe thge
- 4 tothe
+ 4 rating sytem
) isnt far moreso accurate
. thsi movei isnt so bad tht peopel infront hte audiance weere laughing
, chortling at thte bad acting
adn crummy dialouge
. i cant see thsi film turning inot tyhe enxt rocky horror picture sohw
. peopel weere getting so feeded uv htey weere yelling warnings uv tothe tyhe charachters onthe hte screen
. hadnt tothe hvea something tothe dont
. dumb
, dumb
, dumb movei
. i wass embarassed tyhat i spended moeny tothe see it
. it goes wihtout saying thast i disagree wih yhe otehr reviews onthe hte board thast attemp tothe review thge film fo itself
. lots ofthe slime
adn red
- dyed corn syrap doesnt nto constitute
" horror
,
" inaddition my opinyon
