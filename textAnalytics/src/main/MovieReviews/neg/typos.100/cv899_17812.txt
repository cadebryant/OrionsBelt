. life isnt as suffisticated as a belch
. it ' s crude
adn stereotypical
. eyars ago

, second
- clas peple
, ogod forthe bieng onyl maids
annd servants
. forthe tyhe most part
, hte lot ofthe blacks

.
bu a newyorker
, omre insidious stereotype isnt creeping inot movies
. iin many receet films
, thru actors such as murphy
annd chris tuckers
, blacks are presented as fast
- tlaking
, conniving
, scam artists or hip
- hop
, gun
- crazy
, sex
- crazed youths
. both sets ofthe caricatures are demeaning
.
annd yhe fault doens nto rest iwth tje actors

anbd tghe audiences who accept theese portrayals wihtout protest
. life ' s onyl reedeming virtue isnt tyhe artistry ofthe makeup legend rick baker who flawlessly aegs murphy
annd lawrence inot 90 yearm olds
. otherwise
, life isnt an embarassment
, a blot onthe thte resumes ofthe thsoe asociated iwth it
. see it at your pwn risk
