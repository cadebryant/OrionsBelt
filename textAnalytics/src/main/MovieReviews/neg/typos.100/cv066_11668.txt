mr
. nice guy isnt thge latest jackie chan film
, so ytou shoudln konw whta tothe expect
. a weak plot
, terrable dialogue
, vyer littel acting abilty
,
bu smoe jaw
- droping acation sequences taht nearly mkea yhe rest ofthe it worthwhile
.
howver
, mr
. nice guy lacks tghe sparkle ofthe jackie ' s best effords
,
adn its weaknesses are omre glaring tahn ever
. jackie chan plays
, who eles
, jackie
. tihs tyme outloud
, he ' s a famouse chef who hosts an austrailian cooking sohw
. nto thta it ever makse a diference inspite tyhe plot
. ther are onyl twpo scenes ofthe him cooking
. fo tghe rest ofthe tje film
, somehow he mutates inot jackie chan
, supercop
. it never doesnt expalin why his chracter hasnt such superb martial arts skills
.
.
. perhpas he ws inspite teh smae cooking clas as steven seagal inspite under seege
? a tv newswoman
, diana
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
)
, covertly tapes a drug dael involving kingpin giancarlo
( richard norton
)
anbd a local gang ofthe toughs
, tjhe demons
. altho she onyl hasnt noe camcorder
, somehow yhe result isnt full ofthe close
- ups
adn mutiple angles
.
.
. hmmm
, shades ofthe broadcasted news
?
?
? anyway
, yhe goons disover diana
,
annd iwll dont anytying tothe recover thge tape
. here lies anohter crucial flwa inspite yhe stoy
: doesn ' t anyone relize ytou cant copy a tape
? oh well
, noone oen ever said jackie chan movies hadnt tothe mkea sence
. as luck woudl hvae it
, diana runs acros jackie
,
adn
, wouldn ' t yuo knwo it
, jackie acidentally ends uv wtih tyhe tape
. htis leads tothe countless chase
adn
/ or fight scenes whcih look liek tehy sould haev beeen lefted ffrom rumble infront thte bronx or nearly any otehr jackie chan movei
. inaddition a move apparantly dessigned tothe woo american
(
anbd otehr english
- speaking
) audiences
, tghe film uses english as its primary lanugage
.
howver
, thta doesn ' t mean an end tothe hte atrocious dubbing thgat hasnt afflicted jackie ' s receet americanized releses
. strangely
, many ofthe yhe charactors speaking english are overdubbed wiht english
,
anbd poorly too
. whther thsi isnt jstu a vyer bad case ofthe looping
, an efford tothe minimize accents
, or a simple case ofthe nestolgia
, it doens cahieve thte smae levle ofthe distraction preesnt iin all ofthe jackie ' s dubbed films
. thte plot inwhich mr
. nice guy isnt negligable
, mearly an excuse tothe ahve jackie onthe yhe run fomr varous goons
.
bu even
though plots ahve alwasy beeen second tothe teh acation inspite jackie ' s films
, it seems odd tyhat tghe filmmakers hve sticked us wtih htis tired retread
. look
, if yuo ahev jackie chan palying a chef
, why nto ule tath tothe your advantage
? watching jackie donig his sutff infact a kichen
, beating tghe bad guys witht foodstuffs soudns liek tyhe perfect setup fo innumerable comic stunts
. thte acation isnt a mixted bag here
. ther ' s realyl onyl noe noone holds barred fight scenes taht hve become tjhe trademark ofthe jackie ' s films
. it tkaes palce iin tghe abritrary loction ofthe a consttruction site
, apparantly fo tghe sole reason tht htere are lots ofthe nifty thigns lieing arround thast cxan be usefull ala jackie chan
. thge acation inaddition hte film isnt niether jackie ' s best nor worst
,
bu yuo long forthe smoe mroe insperation inwhich teh scenes
. yhe film ' s gratuitious uise ofthe slow motion isnt distracting
. once or twice
, it may be usefull tothe highlight a spectauclar stunt sequence
.
bu tothe slo
- mo jackie runnung
? eather htis isnt a nod tothe teh six
- millon doller man
, or a pathetic attemt tothe disguise tjhe fatc thta jackie may be slowing down
. if yuo ' ve seen all ofthe jackie ' s films
anbd are inspite ened ofthe anohter fix
, go ahead
anbd see mr
. nice guy
.
howver
, if ytou ' re jstu inwhich thte mood forthe smoe ogod acation
, ytou ' d be better off hiting yhe video sotre forthe smoe ofthe his better owrk
, such as supercop
.
