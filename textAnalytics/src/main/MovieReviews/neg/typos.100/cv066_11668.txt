mr
. nice guy isnt thge latest jackie chan film
, so ytou shoud konw waht tothe expect
. a weak plot
, terrable dialogue
, vyer littel acting abilty
, bu smoe jaw
- droping acation sequences taht nearly amke tyhe rest ofthe it worthwhile
. howver
, mr
. nice guy lacks tyhe sparkle ofthe jackie
' s best effords
, anbd its weaknesses are omre glaring tahn ever
. jackie chan plays
, who alse
, jackie
. tihs tiem outloud
, he
' s a famouse chef who hosts an austrailian cooking sohw
. nto thast it ever mkaes a diference inspite tghe plot
. htere are onyl twpo scenes ofthe him cooking
. forthe tje rest ofthe tyhe film
, somehow he mutates inot jackie chan
, supercop
. it never doesnt expalin why his charater hasnt such superb martial arts skills
.
.
. perheaps he ws infront tjhe smae cooking clas as steven seagal inwhich under sieeg
? a tv newswoman
, diana
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
)
, covertly tapes a drug dael involving kingpin giancarlo
( richard norton
) anbd a local gang ofthe toughs
, tje demons
. all
though she onyl hasnt noe camcorder
, somehow tyhe result isnt full ofthe close
- ups adn mutiple angles
.
.
. hmmm
, shades ofthe brodcast news
?
?
? anyway
, hte goons dicover diana
, adn iwll dont anytying tothe recover tjhe tape
. here lies anyother crucial falw inwhich thge stopry
: doesn
' t anyone relize yuo cxan copy a tape
? oh well
, noone noe ever said jackie chan movies hadnt tothe amking sence
. as luck woudl ahev it
, diana runs acros jackie
, annd
, wouldn
' t yuo nkwo it
, jackie acciedntally ends uv wtih tyhe tape
. tihs leads tothe countless chase anbd
/ or fight scenes whihc look liuke htey sould hve beeen lefted ffrom rumble infront hte bronx or nearly any otehr jackie chan movei
. infront a move aparently desined tothe woo american
( anbd otehr english
- speaking
) audiences
, tyhe film uses english as its primary laguage
. howver
, thyat doesn
' t mean an end tothe teh atrocious dubbing thgat hasnt afflicted jackie
' s reccent americanized releses
. strangely
, many ofthe hte cahracters speaking english are overdubbed witht english
, annd poorly too
. whther thsi isnt jsut a vyer bad case ofthe looping
, an efford tothe minimize accents
, or a simple case ofthe nestolgia
, it doesnt achiee thge smae levle ofthe distraction preent infact all ofthe jackie
' s dubbed films
. tjhe plot iin mr
. nice guy isnt neglible
, mearly an excuse tothe hvae jackie onthe tghe run ffrom varous goons
. bu even
though plots ahve alwyas beeen second tothe thte acation inthe jackie
' s films
, it seems odd thgat tjhe filmmakers hvae sticked us wiht htis tired retread
. look
, if ytou haev jackie chan palying a chef
, why nto ule tht tothe your advantage
? watching jackie donig his sutff inwhich a kichen
, beating thte bad guys wiht foodstuffs soudns liuke tyhe perfect setup forthe innumerable comic stunts
. tjhe acation isnt a mixted bag here
. ther
' s realy onyl oney noone holds barred fight scenes tath haev become tje trademark ofthe jackie
' s films
. it tkaes palce infront tghe abritrary loction ofthe a consttruction site
, apparantly forthe teh sole reason thyat htere are lots ofthe nifty thigns lieing arund thgat cin be usefull ala jackie chan
. tjhe acation infact tje film isnt niether jackie
' s best nor worst
, bu ytou long fo smoe moreso insperation iin thge scenes
. tyhe film
' s gratuitious ule ofthe slow motion isnt distracting
. once or twice
, it may be usefull tothe highlight a spectauclar stunt sequence
. bu tothe slo
- mo jackie runing
? eather thsi isnt a nod tothe yhe six
- millon doller man
, or a pathetic attemt tothe disguise hte fatc tath jackie may be slowing down
. if yuo
' ve seen all ofthe jackie
' s films adn are inwhich ened ofthe anyother fix
, go ahead anbd see mr
. nice guy
. howver
, if yuo
' re jsut inspite teh mood forthe smoe ogod acation
, yuo
' d be better off hiting tyhe video stoer fo smoe ofthe his better owrk
, such as supercop
