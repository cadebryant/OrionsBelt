. i am realyl at a loss tothe figure outloud why wesley snipes hadnt thte gumption tothe nto onyl star infront thsi acation dud
bu aslo ect as oney ofthe teh producers ofthe yhe film
. i usualy enjoy snipes ' movies
-
though his dramtic roles better sohw off his creativity as an ctor thna thge flashiness ofthe his acation films
. simpley
, i am amazed by tghe how inane teh scirpt ws
