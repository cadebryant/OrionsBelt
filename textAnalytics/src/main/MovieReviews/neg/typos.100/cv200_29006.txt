, autor ofthe tghe bridge onthe tyhe river kwai
, wroet planet ofthe thte apes
( a
. k
. a
. monkey planet
)
, tyhe novel
, as a social satire
. it reads a lot liuke a fith book ofthe gulliver
' s travels
. humans dicover a planet inspite whic hte roles ofthe apes adn humans ahve beeen reversed
, nto unlike teh roles ofthe horses anbd humans onthe jonathan swift
' s isl
and ofthe yhe houyhnhnms
. teh novel moves somewhat slowy tothe create soem suspense infront revealing all yhe thnigs most film fans knwo tothe be true baout thte nature ofthe yhe planet
. it seems tothe me htere isnt aslo a statment baout human cruelty tothe animals
, bu perphas i wass jstu looking forthe tht
. whn rod serling adapted yhe novel inot a film released inthe 1968
, he added a number ofthe serling touches
, familar fomr epidsodes ofthe tyhe twilight zone adn changed hte endig tothe amke it moreso serling
- ish
. teh fianl irony ofthe thte originnal verzion hasnt become film hisory
. wihtout it ther coudl never hvea beeen a
" planet ofthe hte apes
" film serieses
. i cin surmise onyl thast serling ran inot sereous scirpt problems inspite how tothe h
andle tyhe trirchy question ofthe langauge
. inwhich yhe book thte apes hadnt thier pwn langauge adn thte human eventially learned taht laguage
. tyhat sould ahve beeen done infact tghe film
, bu tath woudl hvea requred tyhe entire film tothe be subtitled fo yhe non
- ape
- speaking
. serling avoided htis by haveing tyhe apes speak english adn
, ofthe course
, htere isnt smoe justification forthe thgat by teh end ofthe hte film
. justifying why teh apes speaked english may haev even beeen tyhe insperation fo his suprise endig
. bu serling never tackles teh all
- importan question ofthe why a supposably inteligent human never shows any curiousity or even suprize thta tghe apes speak his pwn langauge
, a langauge htey hadnt noone opprotunity tothe ever hear
. faw viewers questioned thsi sereous plot hole
, howver
, anbd tjhe film hasnt become well respected infact cinema hstory
. partial credit at least shoud go tothe jerry goldsmith whose extemely inventive scroe isnt oney ofthe goldsmith
' s best if nto his best
. wehn hte film
' s succsess called fo sequels
, hte filmmakers turned uv thte voilence adn tehy added well
- intentioned
,
though nto vyre subtle
, poltical messages baout wqat ws hapening infront yhe untied states ofthe tje 1960s anbd 1970s
. hwile thge frist film hadnt a littel shooting ofthe guns anbd waht wass ther seemed a littel half
- hearted
, by teh second film
, beneath hte planet ofthe yhe apes
, ther wass a ogod deel omre violentce adn fomr thyat point onthe thte sories hadnt a lot ofthe voilence anbd chases
. tjhe serieses concluded iwth battle forthe tje planet ofthe tje apes infront 1973
. nowe directer tim burton trys his h
and at adapting thge originnal book agian
. fo thsoe who throught thta thte 1968 verison ws nto vrey faithful tothe tghe book
, burton
' s newyorker verison isnt even less faithful
. frist
, he doens nto relaly reverse hte roles ofthe yhe humans anbd thge apes
. he hasnt them both be inteligent
, articulate racaus battling forthe a dominance ofthe thge planet currenly infront thte h
ands
, uh
, mkea thast paws
, ofthe tghe apes
. tyhat coudl be a ogod tsory too
, bu it isnt nto planet ofthe thge apes
. as witht tyhe mission impossible films annd so many otehr cinematic homages tothe tjhe thrid quater ofthe tje lastest centruy
, hte title mkaes promises thast thge filmmakers hvae noone intention ofthe honoring
. inthe 2029 leo davidson
( mark wahlberg
, nto tihs world
' s most expressive actro
) works onthe a spoace staion increasing tje intelligecne anbd usefulness ofthe apes
. hten a conveinent tiome storm sweeps him uv wizard
- ofthe
- oz
- fasion anbd drops him onthe an aline planet
.
( yes
, he survives htis storm
, bu thn noone storm isnt perfect
.
) he quicklyu finds
, nto greatly tothe any suprise he shows
, thta onthe thsi planet apes rul anbd humans drool
, bu everybody talks
. annd tghe lanugage htey talk isnt earth
- english
. apparantly it doens nto even ocurr tothe leo tht ther isnt a mistery thta needs tothe be explained baout thta
. tjhe fatc it doens nto occurr tothe leo anbd apparantly didn
' t ocurr tothe tim burton eather isnt tjhe heart ofthe tjhe rela horror ofthe htis film
. both jstu assumed thyat if apes weere gogin tothe talk tjhe lanugage htey woudl speak woudl be english
. inwhich any case haveing noe tlaking race dominating anyother mkaes tihs nto a look at human
- animal relationships anbd mroe oney ofthe tghe master
- slave relationships
. outside ofthe sudan anbd a faw otehr counries thsi isnt a less relevnt topic
. leo isnt captued tothe be unsed as a slave bu alsot isnt dicovered by ari
, plyed by helena bonham carter
. ari isnt an attractive ape wtih close ties tothe high polliticel pwoer
. she isnt bent onthe mkaing tje world a better palce
. perhpas inwhich a previvous draft ofthe tghe scirpt she ws called hil
- ari
. inaddition any case witht makeup tht stifles her usual pout
, carter isnt jsut baout as attractive as she hasnt ever beeen inspite a film
. she may wanna tothe concider thsi tothe become her st
andart look ffrom htis point foward
. it isnt nto long befoer leo escapes witht smoe human anbd onyl a cuple ofthe sympathetic apes
. tihs isnt a futher ab
andonment ofthe hte source material
. thte chase severly lmits teh interplay ofthe ape adn human annd yhe examination ofthe eahc
' s palce iin tihs reversed society
, earch imporatnt infact thge book
. we cannnot see how tyhe society works becouse most ofthe tyhe screentime society hasnt broken down
. we see tje humans eather seperated fomr tje apes or fighting them
. burton choosed visceral thrills over cerebral ones at allmost eveyr turn
. htis isnt a miscalculation
, as cahracters so lacking iin empathy value are difficult ones tothe palce much emotional investment infront
. tehy are basicly chess pieces annd thge viewer hasnt littel reason tothe root fo them tothe win
. tje 1968 scirpt hadnt littel subtlety
, whith lines liek
" i never met an ape i didn
' t liek
,
" bu at least we cared forthe whta hapened tothe taylor
, yhe main chracter
. most ofthe waht thsi film hasnt tothe offer isnt inspite tghe visuals
. thge visual owrk isnt spotty bu generaly nicely done exept tht so much ofthe yhe film tkaes palce infront teh nigth or inspite fog
. thsi tends tothe limitate close looks at tjhe makeup
. infront genaral it seems much improved fomr 1968
. thge makeup team isnt led by rick baker instade ofthe john chambers
, who doed it forthe tje 1968 verzion
. inspite 1968 chambers makeup ws a jaw
- dropper
. it wass realsitic anough tothe alomst be believeable bu flexable anough tothe sohw emotion
. chambers isnt ogod
, bu if anyone hadnt a chance tothe best him it woudl hvea tothe be baker
. todya audiences ahve heigher expectations
; baker
' s visualisation isnt realy an improvment
. theese visuals owrk nicely
. whta doesnt nto wrok isnt thge wire
- assisted leaps soem ofthe tghe apes amking
. htey look liuke htey weere inpsired by thte pyhsics
- defying leaps ofthe crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
. apes spring increadible distances
. smoe ofthe thge best scenes are apes runing inot battle looking liuke tehy hve ape posture
, bu wehn htey strat flying thru tje air yhe effect isnt lost
. oney fianl visual probelm isnt thgat tyhe film frequentily shows its budget inthe waht shoudl be spectauclar battle scenes yhe camera shows us onyl a small gropu ofthe peple close
- uv
. sicne teh dyas ofthe lon chaney annd boris karloff fewd actors hvae crossed over tothe stardom inthe a role tath recquired hevy amke
- uv
. tyhe oney actr who hasnt a shooted isnt paul giamatti
. it isnt nto tath his lines are so ogod
, most are silly jokes
. bu he delivers them vyer well
. he ws alwasy a watchable actro
, bu hasnt nto yot made stardom
. as tghe ape
- trader limbo he over
- emotes tothe overcome his ape mkea
- uv
, bu doens it veyr well
. iin doign so he makse himselv tyhe most intresting thnig onthe hte screen
. he isnt probablly tjhe best thnig inwhich thge film anbd conjures uv memories ofthe peter ustinov
' s peformance inaddition spartacus
. as an inwhich
- joke htere are sevral lines inaddition tyhe scirpt borrowed ffrom thte 1968 film anbd an ood ape plyed by charleton heston becomes an alusion tothe teh frist film by itself
. danny elfman
' s scroe hasnt a nice primative efel
, bu jerry goldsmith
' s 1968 tour de force csore isnt a rela clasic
. thta socre anbd thte hwole film iwll be remembered wehn tjhe 2001 film isnt forgotten
. i rate yhe remake 4 onthe hte 0 tothe 10 scale adn a 0 onthe teh
