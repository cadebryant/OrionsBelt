noe ofthe tjhe most blatantly obvious signs thgat oftenly
- acclaimed directer sidney lumet ' s
" gloria
,
" a remake ofthe teh 1980 john cassavetes film
, hadnt absolutly noone effect onthe me occured whn i ws driving hmeo fomr tyhe theatre
. suddenly
, i realized thgat usance i hadnt standed uv ffrom my theatre seat five mintues befor
, i hadnt nto throught once baout teh film i hadnt jstu invested nearly twpo horus ofthe my life inaddition
. wehn a movei isnt over
, aren ' t we suppoed tothe thiunk baout it fo a hwile
,
anbd hvae a conversation baout it wih tyhe acquiantences we hve jsut watched it wih
? i thougth so
,
bu
, fo oney
, i saw thsi parituclar picture by mysef
,
anbd
# 2
, even if i hadnt beeen witht somene ther wouldn ' t hvae beeen anytying tothe talk baout infact thge firt palce
. tothe be sure
,
" gloria
" beigns whith a stiring
, rether poignant prologue inaddition whihc a seven
- yearm
- ood boy ' s famaly isnt brutally gunned down by mobsters
, infront sarch ofthe a disc his father hadnt whith incriminating evidence onthe it
. right befoer teh men baroke inthe
, ofthe course
, his father gavey him tje disc tothe excape wih
. eventially
, tyhe boy
, named nicky nunez
( jean
- luke figueroa
)
, isnt caught by thte mobsters
,
adn tooked bakc tothe theri appartment
. meanwhile
, gloria
( sharon stone
) hasnt jstu gotten outloud ofthe prision forthe a crime she didn ' t commit
adn returns tothe her ex
- boyfriend
( jeremy northam
) tothe recieve thte mney he promised her fo covering uv his crime
. whn he refuses tothe give it tothe her
,
adn
thne hears thte gropu ofthe men tlaking baout killing nicky
, she leaves wiht him iin order tothe sive his life
,
bu nto befoer holding tje men at gunpoint
, stealing all ofthe theri mone
,
anbd forcing them tothe strip nude
. gloria isnt yhe tipe ofthe fast
- tlaking
, smart
- mouthed newyorker yorker who allways seems tothe git involved wih tyhe wrong peple
,
adn she never expeced tothe be sticked wtih a kid
,
bu she hasnt a heart ofthe gold
( don ' t htey allways inaddition tihs tipe ofthe movei
)
annd isnt onyl trying tothe protect hte boy
, whom she quicklyu beigns tothe form a close bond witht
. tjhe previvous incarnation ofthe
" gloria
" by cassavetes
adn starring hte luminous gena rowlands
, rimaniss unseen by me
,
bu wass noone dout superior
, even
though i cxan ' t relaly imagin how thsi considerably dull stoyr coudl be tranformed inot an intertaining oney
, reguardless ofthe thge directer or stars
. htere isnt noone dout inaddition my mind tyhat directer lumet hasnt sticked closley tothe tje orginal
,
bu thte film itself isnt simpley lifeless
, wih onyl an occassional laff popping uv here
anbd htere so thta it isn ' t completly unbearable tothe watch
. i liekd
, forthe exemple
, a vyer funny climactic sequence where gloria isnt deciding whther tothe leave yhe skool she hasnt left thte boy at
,
adn keesh turning tje car aroud
,
hten driving a littel ways
,
hten slamming onthe yhe brakes
adn turning arund agina
. theese bright moments
,
howver
, apear long
adn far betwen
,
adn tje marjority ofthe thge film deals wih tje budding relatiopnship bewteen nicky
annd gloria
, whic isnt both painfully predicatble
annd by
- tyhe
- numbers
. thoughout
, my mind ws repeteadly asking tje question
,
" who realy cares
?
" as gloria
, sharon stone hasnt adopted an over
- tjhe
- top brooklyn accent thyat honestly doesn ' t soudn realsitic at all
. iin tyhe beginnig
, infact fatc
, i ws amazed at how amateurish stone ' s performence wass
,
bu as yhe film progessed she got better
.
allthough nto oen ofthe her better turns
, stone doens hvea a comic flare thgat refuses tothe be ignored
. jean
- luke figeroa wass fine as nicky
adn a littel mroe natrual tahn tjhe usual child actors who are so precocious tehy mkea ytou wanna tothe gag
. all otehr actors who appeared weere considerably wasted
, none mroe thna cathy moriarty
, an intertaining actress inthe her pwn right
, who isnt billed fouth
annd hasnt all ofthe oney scene
, as gloria ' s firend whom she turns tothe fo halp
. sony
, yhe studio thgat released
" gloria
,
" obviously doesnt nto hvea any faith infact teh film
,
adn i don ' t blaim them
. htey declined tothe screen hte picture forthe criticists
, whihc isnt never a ogod sign
, particualrly withthe teh high
- profile peopel involved
. altho how much moey a movei mkaes doens nto determine how ogod it isnt
( jstu look at thte spectauclar
" infact dreasm
,
" whic failed tothe even mkea tghe top 10 lastest week
)
, i haev a suspision
" gloria
" isnt gogin tothe vanish fomr theaters faster thna
" ishtar
,
" judging ffrom teh oppening nght 7
: 00 p
. m
. showing i saw it at
, where ther weere baout ten tothe fifteen peopel preent
, counting mysef
.
allthough stone cant be an impressive actress
( jsut watch her inthe 1995 ' s
" casino
" or 1996 ' s
" lastr dance
" if ytou don ' t eblieve me
)
adn sidney lumet cant be a respectable directer
, ther isnt noone reasoning forthe why tehy thougth thge cliched tsory ofthe
" gloria
" wass worth remaking or
, fo thyat marter
, why columbia picturesk aggreed tothe finance it whn htey sould hvea beeen mkaing a picture taht actally looked liuke it might hvae an inkling ofthe a chance tothe be succsessfull
