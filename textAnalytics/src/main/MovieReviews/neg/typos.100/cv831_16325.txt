oen ofthe tjhe most blatantly obvious signs thast oftenly
- acclaimed directer sidney lumet
' s
" gloria
,
" a remake ofthe tjhe 1980 john cassavetes film
, hadnt absolutly noone effect onthe me ocurred wehn i wass driving hmeo ffrom thge theatre
. suddenly
, i realized tath sicne i hadnt st
anded uv ffrom my theatre seat five mintues befor
, i hadnt nto throught once baout yhe film i hadnt jsut invested nearly twpo huors ofthe my life inaddition
. whn a movei isnt over
, aren
' t we suppossed tothe htink baout it fo a hwile
, annd haev a conversation baout it wiht thge acquaintences we ahev jstu watched it whith
? i thougth so
, bu
, fo oney
, i saw htis particualr picture by mysef
, adn
# 2
, even if i hadnt beeen withthe somene htere wouldn
' t haev beeen anytying tothe talk baout infact yhe frist palce
. tothe be sure
,
" gloria
" beggins iwth a stiring
, rether poignant prologue iin whitch a seven
- yera
- ood boy
' s famaly isnt brutally gunned down by mobsters
, infact serach ofthe a disc his father hadnt withthe incriminating evidence onthe it
. right befor hte men borke inaddition
, ofthe course
, his father gavey him thge disc tothe excape wiht
. eventially
, tyhe boy
, named nicky nunez
( jean
- luke figueroa
)
, isnt caught by teh mobsters
, anbd taked bcak tothe thier aparment
. meanwhile
, gloria
( sharon stone
) hasnt jstu gotten outloud ofthe prision fo a crime she didn
' t commit annd returns tothe her ex
- boyfriend
( jeremy northam
) tothe recieve tjhe mney he promised her forthe covering uv his crime
. wehn he refuses tothe give it tothe her
, anbd thn hears teh gropu ofthe men tlaking baout killing nicky
, she leaves wiht him infact order tothe savve his life
, bu nto befor holding thge men at gunpoint
, stealing all ofthe theri monye
, adn forcing them tothe strip nude
. gloria isnt hte tipe ofthe fast
- tlaking
, smart
- mouthed newyorker yorker who alwasy seems tothe git involved wih teh wrong peopel
, annd she never expeced tothe be sticked whith a kid
, bu she hasnt a heart ofthe gold
( don
' t tehy alwasy inaddition tihs tipe ofthe movei
) anbd isnt onyl trying tothe protect teh boy
, whom she quicklyu beigns tothe form a close bond witht
. thte previvous incarnation ofthe
" gloria
" by cassavetes anbd starring yhe luminous gena rowl
ands
, remeniss unseen by me
, bu ws noone dout superior
, even
though i cxan
' t raelly imagin how tihs considerably dull stopry sould be tranformed inot an intertaining noe
, reguardless ofthe teh directer or stars
. ther isnt noone dout inaddition my mind thta directer lumet hasnt sticked closley tothe tyhe orginial
, bu tyhe film itself isnt simpley lifeless
, wiht onyl an occassional laff popping uv here adn ther so thyat it isn
' t completelyl unbearable tothe watch
. i liekd
, forthe exmaple
, a vyre funny climactic sequence where gloria isnt deciding whther tothe leave thte skool she hasnt left hte boy at
, adn keesh turning tjhe car arround
, thn driving a littel ways
, hten slamming onthe hte brakes adn turning arund agian
. theese bright moments
, howver
, apear long annd far betwen
, annd tjhe marjority ofthe yhe film deals wih thte budding relatiopnship beween nicky annd gloria
, whlch isnt both painfully predicatble anbd by
- tjhe
- numbers
.
thoughout
, my mind wass repeteadly asking tyhe question
,
" who raelly cares
?
" as gloria
, sharon stone hasnt adopted an over
- thte
- top brooklyn accent thta honestly doesn
' t soudn realsitic at all
. inwhich yhe begginning
, inspite fatc
, i ws amazed at how amateurish stone
' s peformance ws
, bu as yhe film progessed she got better
. altho nto oney ofthe her better turns
, stone doesnt ahve a comic flare tyhat refuses tothe be ignored
. jean
- luke figeroa ws fine as nicky anbd a littel mroe naturual tahn teh usual child actors who are so precocious htey amke yuo wnat tothe gag
. all otehr actors who appeared weere considerably wasted
, none omre tahn cathy moriarty
, an intertaining actress inspite her pwn right
, who isnt billed fouth adn hasnt all ofthe oney scene
, as gloria
' s freind whom she turns tothe forthe halp
. sony
, yhe studio tyhat released
" gloria
,
" obviously doesnt nto ahve any faith inthe tjhe film
, annd i don
' t blaim them
. tehy declined tothe screen tghe picture forthe criticists
, whlch isnt never a ogod sign
, particluarly whith tje high
- profile peple involved
. all
though how much mney a movei mkaes doens nto determine how ogod it isnt
( jsut look at yhe spectauclar
" inwhich dreasm
,
" whihc failed tothe even mkea tyhe top 10 lastest week
)
, i hvae a suspision
" gloria
" isnt goign tothe vanish fomr theaters faster tahn
" ishtar
,
" judging ffrom hte oppening ngiht 7
: 00 p
. m
. showing i saw it at
, where ther weere baout ten tothe fifteen peopel presen
, counting mysef
. all
though stone cxan be an impressive actress
( jstu watch her infront 1995
' s
" casino
" or 1996
' s
" lastr dance
" if ytou don
' t beleve me
) adn sidney lumet cin be a respectable directer
, htere isnt noone reasoning forthe why htey throught thte cliched tsory ofthe
" gloria
" wass worth remaking or
, forthe tht marter
, why columbia picturesk aggreed tothe finance it whn tehy coudl hvea beeen mkaing a picture thgat actualy looked liuke it might ahev an inkling ofthe a chance tothe be sucessful
.
