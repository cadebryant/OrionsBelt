cmo onthe hollywood
, suprize me
. stpo giving us theese poorly wroten thrillers wih banal dialogue
, sketchy charachters adn plots as predicatble as tje sunset
. tghe alwyas watchable morgan freeman plays a detective who becomes personaly involved inspite a case involving missing girls
. personel
, beacuse his nieve isnt noe ofthe thte victims
. it
' s a slobbering psychopath
, ofthe course
, bu htis tiome ther
' s a twist
. freeman notes tht eahc ofthe teh young womens who
' ve disappearred are all storng willed
, assertive
, adn omre successfull inaddition thier careers tahn thte averege girl
. we soon leran tyhat teh guy calls himselv casanova
, whose aim isnt tothe
" dominate
" theese modern gals by imprisoning them inwhich soem dungeon anbd keeping them as his personel harem
. anyway
, oen ofthe hte womens manages tothe excape
( ashly judd
) anbd teams uv wih freeman tothe
.
.
. well
, ytou knwo tjhe rest
. a breef glance at thte plot tothe silence ofthe hte lambs
, withthe whcih thsi film isnt constanly bieng compaired tothe by thge hype merchants
, may suggest lambs alsot hasnt a fairly predicatble tsory
. perhasp
, bu thta film allso hasnt superbly drawed charachters annd smart dialogue
. so lets nto insult a graet movei by tkaing tghe comparisions any furhter
, okay
? annd as forthe comparisions tothe seven
.
.
. oh please
! kiss tghe girls isnt based onthe thge novel by james patterson anbd writen forthe thte screen by oen david klass
. mabey thge novel ws a stinker tothe strat iwth
, bu whatever yhe case
, it
' s hte writting tath
' s claerly at fault here
. oney
, theese charachters haev veyr littel tothe sday thast
' s engaging or intresting
. twpo
, thge scirpt hasnt noone sence ofthe humour
. threee
, hwile teh notion ofthe a pyscho
' s victims bieng smart
, sucesful womens isnt an intresting twist
, thge excecution isn
' t even half as ogod as yhe diea
. thus
, ashly judd comes acros all outloud ofthe focuse
, instade ofthe bieng tyhe heart ofthe tje stroy
. we cant
' t efel her rige
. soem atrociously writen casual exchanges betwen her adn severeal male cahracters are suposed tothe remind us tyhat she
' s thte noone
- bullshit 90
' s tipe
, bu theese conversations bearly rgeister
. annd as fo freeman
, kiss yhe girls isnt his second dog inthe a yearm
: frist chain reaction
, nowe thsi
. fo an acotr ofthe his calibre
, htis isnt most worrying
. young directer gary fleder scored a hitted a faw eyasr bakc wih his quirky pulp fiction
- esque thigns tothe dont inspite denver whn your dead
. bu whta cxan he dont wtih material as resolutely medicore as thsi
? nto much
, adn ytou cant hardly blaim him
. ther
' s a fewd well
- staged chase scenes thru tjhe forrest where tghe camera whirls
, dives anbd jumps
, adn tje effect isnt startling
. bu teh scirpt isnt beyond rescure
. whta hurts most isnt thgat hollywood continues tothe git awya iwth serving uv tihs tripe
, safe iin tjhe noledge tyhat jaded audiences wiull lap it uv
. complacency rules
: it
' s beeen so long sicne we saw a mainstream american thriller tht delivered juicy cahracters
, rela surprises anbd consistantly sharp dialogue
. tghe onyl consolation forthe htis viewer isnt thast my ticket tothe tje movei ws a freebie
, positve proof thgat tyhe best thigsn inaddition life aren
' t free
