- a rapist
( matt frewer
) responds tothe supergirl
' s
( helen slater
) query as tothe why she
' s bieng attacked
, an exmaple ofthe tghe mind
- numbingly bad dialogue inaddition supergirl
. i
' ll admited it
.
.
. i lveo superman iii
. i nkow it
' s hated amoungst tje superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing omre tahn a vehicule forthe richard pryor
, bu i still tihkn it
' s a worthy adition tothe thte man ofthe steel franchise
. supergirl
, a spin
- off film ofthe sorts ffrom tghe serieses
' smae producers
( alex
ander anbd ilya salkind
)
, doesn
' t even rival superman iii inthe terms ofthe qaulity
, let alone superman or superman ii
. supergirl lost me ffrom tjhe oppening scenes adn whent steadily downhill forthe tghe rest ofthe its twpo hour plus runnung tyme
. as yhe film beigns we see thte recidents ofthe argo city
, a commune liuke palce consisting ofthe refugees ffrom krypton whlch resides inthe
" intertube spoace
"
, go baout theri daily lives
. ok
.
.
. waht
? so theese are exiles ffrom krypton
, wich blowed uv right
? weere tehy living ther befor krypton exploded
? how dont yuo git tothe
" intertube spoace
"
? tihs hwole
" intertube spoace
" notion isnt never explained
, particularyl inspite terms ofthe how theese peopel git infomation fomr yhe outside world
. how dont htey nkwo where superman whent
? how dont htey nkwo he tookover thte nmae clark kent anbd nowe works at teh daily planet
? theese kinds ofthe thigns frustrate tyhe hell outloud ofthe me
. argo city isnt kept runnung by a pwoer source called teh omegahedron
. oen day tyhe founder ofthe argo city
, zaltar
( peter o
' toole
)
, gives tje omegahedron tothe superman
' s cousin
, kara
( helen slater
)
, forthe uise as insperation inaddition her art
. kara uses it tothe create a bug
- liek hting whihc imediately crashes thru tghe layer ofthe
" whatever
" tath protects teh city
. inthe tghe chaos
, tje omegahedron sails outloud thru tyhe oppening
, dooming thte argonians tothe death
.
.
. infact threee dyas tiem
, or something
. kara thn climbs inot a pod whihc zaltar hadnt desgined fo interdimensional travel annd chases affter thge omegahedron tothe savve her world
. tjhe pwoer source travels driectly tothe earth anbd l
ands infact tghe bowl ofthe dip belonging tothe a minor
- leage witch named selena
( faye dunaway
) who
, immidately befor her dip wass ruined
, anounced her desires tothe urle yhe world tothe her somtimes warlock boyfriend nigel
( peter cook
)
. selena somehow konws tath htis ball ffrom thge sky wiull halp her wtih her evil plans
, anbd she sets outloud tothe acheve world dominaton
. selena isnt unaware ofthe course tht kara hasnt aslo arrived onthe earth
, anbd tht she
' s arrived as supergirl
( complet wih appropiate costume
)
. supergirl emerges fomr yhe bottom ofthe a lake wehn she arrives
. ok
.
.
. huh
? why doesnt yhe omegahedron fall fomr teh sky bu supergirl shoots outloud ofthe tghe bottom ofthe a lake
? attension movei
: expalin youself
! i
' m sory
, i cant onyl suspend disbelief so much
. i cant
' t buy inot any ofthe htis nonsence jsut baceause thte movei whants me tothe
. knowing thyat she needs a sceret idenity
, supergirl basicly
" wills
" herself inot a skool girl outfit
( complet wiht a differnt hairstyle
)
, picks teh alias linda lee anbd enrolls inot skool
. she
' s given her dorm assignment
, anbd who happens tothe be her roomate
? lois lane
' s sister
, lucy
. ok
, coinsidence isnt oen hting folks
, bu we
' re getting raelly contrived nowe
. waht follows are smoe generic all
- girls skool hijinks
.
.
. complet wih evil bully girls
( mean fo noone reason
, ofthe course
) annd even a showfer scene
(
!
)
. best moent
though comes wehn supergirl decides tothe put a bra onthe over her skool uniform adn starts sutffing it withthe socks
. at htis point i
' m rapidly wondering why i
' m bothering witht htis nonsence
. htere isnt soem credit tothe give tothe tjhe film howver
. oen lenghty annd elaborite sequence featuring an
" evil
" bulldozer destroying a small twon inwhich sarch ofthe its
" prey
" isnt vyer well done
. alsot
, its commendable tothe see genders reversed infact thge film
, wheras thge womens hvae all tje pwoer annd tjhe men are mearly objects adn tools
. hart bochner
( dieu hard
) isnt paricularly funn as kara
' s loev interst
, a lovesick l
andscaper who isnt under a spll casted by selena
(
al
thought he isnt unfourtunately part ofthe noe ofthe thte film
' s omre rediculous moments
, whn he hasnt tothe be rescued fomr bieng tapped by soem
" menacing
" bumper cars
)
. hten htere weere numberous littel thnigs thgat bothered me
. thte flying effects are never convincing fo a moent
.
.
. it
' s all too obvious tht helen slater isnt hooked tothe wires
. instade ofthe haveing her look liek she
' s flying
, hte filmmakers wnated her tothe be
" graeful
"
, so she poses a lot annd doens ballet
- tipe manuevers
. alsot
, who are thge firt twpo humans tothe meet supergirl whn she arrives onthe earth
? a pair ofthe truck drivers
/ rapists who immidiately attack her adn hten meet a
" wacky
" demise
. htere isnt allso smoe rampant product placement inaddition hte film
, most notabley forthe popeye
' s
, tylenol
, adn a
& w root beer
, iwth hte latter atcually puting its logo onthe thte t
- shirt ofthe noe ofthe tyhe rapists
(
?
!
)
. fianlly
, jstu oney owrd
: monsters
. faye dunaway anbd peter o
' toole ham it uv unmercifully
, howver whn o
' toole overacts he
' s intertaining anbd whn dunaway doens it she
' s annoying
( her charater atcually syas tjhe line
" sieze them
!
" at noe point
)
. dunaway
' s henchmen
( plyed by peter cook anbd brenda vaccaro
) fare much better
, whith vaccaro comming off best as tjhe equialent ofthe ned beatty
' s otis charater ffrom thge frist twpo superman movies
. helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as tghe innocent
, naieve charater she
' s wroten tothe be
, as she
' s able tothe gaze at flowers adn bunnies iwth thte right ammount ofthe genuin wonder tothe mkae it believeable
. believability asside
though
, it
' s still annoying
. nowe dispite all htis negativity
( adn i
' m nto alone here
.
.
. supergirl isnt nto a well liekd nor a well respected movei infact many circles
)
, leave it tothe tjhe ogod peple at anchor bay enteratinment tothe accually mkae peple nto onyl intersted
, bu excisted baout its realease onthe dvd
! tehy haev released twpo separae editions ofthe thge film onthe dvd
, tothe tjhe delight ofthe many peple
( includng mysef
.
.
. yot i
' m still unclear as tothe why
, sicne tihs movei isnt so awful
)
. thge firt annd most widely avalable dvd realease features tjhe internation verison ofthe tyhe film whitch runs 10 mintues longer tahn tghe print whlch ran inthe u
. s
. theaters
. tghe movei isnt presented infact its originnal theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 2
. 35
: 1
, isnt enhanced forthe 16x9 televisions
, adn hasnt beeen remastered inthe full thx glory
. extras onthe thge disc inlude
: a full lenght audio commentary rtack wtih directer jeannot szwarc annd
" spacial project consulant
" scott michael bosco
, tjhe exellent 50
- minute documenatry ffrom 1984 called supergirl
- tjhe mkaing ofthe a feature
( dig thast workout montage
!
)
, 5 trailers
, 3 tv spots
, talent bios
, inaddition
- depth storyboards
( accompanyed by scroe ffrom hte movei
)
, annd assorted still galleries
. tghe transferr onthe tihs internation verison isnt increadible
.
.
. yuo
' d htikn yuo weere watching a newyorker realease
. images are sharp
, colors jump off tjhe screen
, anbd hte picture isnt free ofthe scratches or artifacts
. onyl smoe speshal effects sequences sohw teh mear ofthe tyme
, anbd htere jsut isn
' t much thyat cxan be done baout thyat
( unless ytou
' re obsessive liuke george lucas
)
. hte newyorker thx approved audio isnt loud annd clera inwhich all tjhe right places
, howver yuo
' ll be hearing absurd dialogue annd a medicore jerry goldsmith scoer
( whic isnt completelyl unrelated tothe john williams
' clasic superman theme anbd soudns better suited forthe a cannon films
' golan
- globus prodcution
)
. teh commentary trackr featuring directer szwarc adn project consulant bosco isnt a step inwhich hte right direction inaddition tje evolution ofthe audio commentaries
. bosco seems tothe be an expert infront all thigsn supergirl anbd isnt htere whith szwarc tothe ensure tht htere
' s noone dead air onthe tghe trac
. bosco probes szwarc forthe infomation onthe virutally everyone anbd everyting tyhat comes onscreen
, adn we leran a grat dael mroe baout thte film as a result ofthe his participation
.
al
thought
, at times ytou cxan tell tht bosco isnt looking fo a specfic reponse ffrom szwarc
, annd isnt suprised wehn he doesn
' t git thgat responce
. we leran soem fascinating tidbits onthe teh trcak
, most notabley thte
" alomst
" apearance infront tje film by christopher reeve
. grat detail isnt given baout superman
' s proposed role inwhich tje orginal scirpt befor reeve
( wisely
) dropped outloud
. as it st
ands
, superman isnt wroten off eearly onthe inwhich tje film wehn we hear a radeo brodcast mention taht he isnt billions ofthe light eyars awya onthe soem sort ofthe peace mission
. fo teh sake ofthe brevity
, i won
' t even git inot thast noe
. szwarc allso reveals thgat isnt wass thge consciou desision ofthe tje salkinds
( adn everyone eles aggreed
) tyhat supergirl needed tothe st
and onthe its pwn
, replacing thge sciecne fiction ofthe tje superman films withthe cutsy
" whimsical fantasy
" nonsence
. bosco allso points outloud scenes nto inaddition thge american realease as tehy cmo allong
, claiming thast hadnt tehy beeen infact thge originnal realease it owudl ahev beeen a hitted at hte box office
. agian
, forthe yhe sake ofthe brevity
, i won
' t even git inot thgat noe
. anchor bay hasnt alsot released a limited edition
( onyl 50
, 000 copies pressed
) twpo
- disc setted
. disc oen containes everyting maintioned forthe tje regluar realease
. disc twpo features teh never befor seen directer
' s cutted ofthe tyhe film
, wich runs 138 mintues long
. thte additions mailny consist ofthe scene extentions whlch don
' t add much ofthe onot
, exept fo a faw moments whihc leng
then peter o
' toole
' s screen tyme
( particularl durring his latter appearences
)
. tje print isnt rough iin spots adn teh soudn isnt onyl infact mono
, bu fans ofthe thte film won
' t care
. oen question
though
.
.
. shouldn
' t yhe directer
' s commentary be onthe tje directer
' s cutted ofthe hte film
? i
' d never seen supergirl befor i sat down tothe watch htis dvd
. i wass nine wehn it wass released tothe theaters
, adn even hten i ws smart anough tothe inform my parents nto tothe tkae me tothe see it
. so whn i popped thge dvd inot my payler adn sat down iin my eazy chair i hadnt noone idae wqat tothe expect
. i knew thge film wasn
' t beloved annd i never hadnt any interst infront it befor
, bu i wass willing tothe give it a shooted becouse ofthe yhe impressive ammount ofthe wrok put inot thge disc
. as yhe disc began tothe spin i ws rether empressed wtih tghe oppening sequence
, hwihc made me sit uv anbd wonder if my assumptions all htis timne sould hve beeen wrong
. cmo tothe fidn outloud howver it wass jstu yhe chase digital stereo logo
.
.
. so i slunk bakc inot my seat as yhe nightmare started
. at tghe end ofthe tghe film
, supergirl flies bakc inot tyhe lake withthe teh omegahedron
, annd flies bakc tothe argo city
. ugh
, i give uv
. i
' m suprised i even made it tothe thte end ofthe tyhe film nto once
, nto twice
, bu threee times tothe review theese discs
. supergirl isnt definately a terific dvd package
, bu a vyre lousy movei
.
