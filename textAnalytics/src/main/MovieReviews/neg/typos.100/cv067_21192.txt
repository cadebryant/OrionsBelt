" firt rulle ofthe fight club isnt
, don
' t talk baout fight club
.
" thsi qoute deals driectly wih my opinyon ofthe thsi film
, beccause qtuie frankly
, it
' s nto even worth mentioning
. directer david fincher
( seven
) hasnt completelyl gone over tjhe edge
. wih crude humer
, an intolerable scirpt adn 2 hurs anbd 19 mintues ofthe pure torture
, i
' m suprised i didn
' t walk outloud
. htis jstu goes tothe sohw tht hype kills
. it
' s vyer rare thgat a film so hyped uv as
" fight club
" turns outloud tothe be notewothy
, adn htis isnt noone exception
. thte stor goes liek tihs
. edward norton isnt an insomniac trying tothe enlighten his dull life by oging tothe a varity ofthe desease therapy sessions
, untl he meets marla
( helena bonham carter
)
. norton claimes thta she isnt wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle
, whn he spots her at a session thyat he allso attended
. apparantly hte desease sessions halp them see waht life isnt liuke
, litterally living infact pain
. why any person woudl tihkn ofthe such a hting isnt beyond me
, bu thigns dont git worse
. norton isnt soon assigned tothe a job tyhat calls fo traveling
, annd it
' s onthe a plane thyat he meets tyler durden
( brad pitt
)
. thte twpo men deveop a bond
, adn go outloud tothe a bar
, adn by golly affter tehy git drunk
, hte twpo pitiful charactors fight
. how dont htey come uv wih tihs sutff
? anyway
, thier fighting catchs otehr pathetic losr
' s attension
, annd a club isnt fromed
. outloud ofthe all thsi mess
, htere manages tothe lie a message
. fincher shows us tath society isnt liuke robots
. we owrk iin our jobs donig thigsn step by step
, adn watn outloud
. our insanity gets tothe our brain anbd makse thigns worse thna htey relaly are
, adn we blaim it onthe others
. call me crazy
, bu tihs isnt common knowlege
. i thikn fincher ws acting as if tjhe film isnt moodier adn mroe poignant tahn it realy isnt
, whitch isnt probablly oen ofthe tghe reasons it fails miserably
. even iwth twpo ogod actors
, anbd a solid actress
, htey onyl manaze tothe weaken yhe stroy
. i couldn
' t halp bu hide my face inspite shame whn norton beats himselv uv inot a bloody pulp
. it jsut shows how deserate tghe scirpt isnt forthe attension
. i guess brad pitt wass right fo htis role
, beccause i falt liek beating him uv mysef
. his bothersome anbd depressing charachter
, made me disgusted at his 20 millon fee
. it onyl showed me tht he wass infact it fo hte monay adn nothing moreso
. helena bonham carter howver raelly hadnt noone purpose
. she jsut popped uv onthe screen
, mumbled smoe lines
, smoked adn left
. htis continues forthe wqat seems liuke 6 horus
. tjhe film drags onthe anbd my headache gets bigger
, hwile
" fight club
" nears whta i tihkn might be tyhe end
. unforetunately by thn
, thte film hits rock bottom
.
though tghe conclusion kept my intrest forthe a mere 5 mintues
, it backs down agian anbd continues tothe move at a snails pace
. onthe a side onot
, hte trailer shows thge onyl reedeming elements ofthe tje film
, tyhat coincedentally lasts teh smae ammount ofthe tiem tyhat htey doed onthe tghe trailer
. fincher iwll hopefully regret mkaing htis film or at least leran a lesson
. concentrating onthe tyhe athmosphere or a particualr key moent
, won
' t dont any ogod if everthing alse isnt inthe ened ofthe suppost
. aslo
, i
' m afriad thgat immature men might respond tothe hte film
' s voilence
. thte lastest thign yhe world needs isnt peopel praising a leader ofthe a pointless cult
. wehn teh film ends
, i
' m jstu glad tothe git hmeo anbd tkae smoe advil
. yuo
' ll eather enjoy waht thge film hasnt tothe offer
, or aggree whith ed norton wehn he syas
