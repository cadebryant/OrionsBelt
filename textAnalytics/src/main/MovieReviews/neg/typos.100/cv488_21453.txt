arriving infact a barrage ofthe hype
, tje blair witch project isnt oney ofthe tyhe biggest box office succes ofthe tjhe yearm
. howver
, liuke thte golden child
, altho blair witch hasnt made a lot ofthe monay
, it
' s nto vyer ogod
. donahue
, williams anbd leonard play themselfs as threee students who setted outloud tothe mkea a documentery baout tje blair witch myth
. tghe film isnt made uv ofthe tghe camcorder footage htey recoreded
, whitch means grainy footage annd woozy camera angles
. altho events strat ofthe normal
, tehy git weidr preety quicklyu
, hwile tghe threesome argue mroe annd mroe as teh jouney goes onthe
. altough an intresting premise
, yhe blair witch project amounts tothe nothing mroe thna a missed oportunity
. thge biggest misteek thte film mkaes isnt tothe let threee medicore actors thge chance tothe improvise
. most ofthe hte dialogue isnt ad
- libbed
, adn still manages tothe soudn liuke a poore b
- movei
. teh
' scirpt
' eventualy degenerates inot shouting matchs
, whith tje f
- owrd included a lot tothe soudn liek students
. ther are breaks infront theese arguements where smoe creepy events occurr
, bu thne it
' s bcak tothe tghe shouting adn swearing
, whitch gets veyr tiresome vyre quicklyu
. if i wnated tothe see threee peple git lost inspite tyhe woods
, shout a lot anbd swaer
, i
' d go onthe scout camp
. bu noone
, tjhe audeince isnt meaned tothe git soem enteratinment factor outloud ofthe tihs
, bu i
' m nto qutie sure how
. yhe supernatural parts ofthe hte film are actally intresting
, expecially if close attension isnt paide tothe tghe stry developing firt twenty mintues
. wih noone music annd noone budget tothe wrok wiht
, tje film hasnt tothe depend onthe natrual
, pyschological scares
, whlch are somtimes well delivered
, somtimes nto
. i never realyl feeled truley scared durig any part ofthe teh film
, all
though ther isnt a small sence ofthe fear underlaying throughtout tjhe film
. howver
, becuase teh actors are so irritating
, tghe scares are lost wehn it evenhtually reverts bakc tothe heather saying
' whta thge f
* ck isnt taht
?
' a lot
, anbd mike giggling liek a lozonya
. htere
' s alsot thte niggling fatc taht theese student filmmakers dont smoe realyl stupid thnigs
. tghe main probelm isnt tje fatc thgat even
though theese hapless bunch sould be killed at any moent
, annd are hopelessly lost
, heather still insists onthe filming it all
. hte film gives a half hearted reason why she shouldnt wnat tothe dont tihs
, bu it isn
' t veyr convincing
. alsot
, thge students hvae noone diea how tothe survive iin tyhe woods
, such as folowing a larg river flowing thru hte woods tothe civilisation
. htere are allso soem parts where thte
' maateur
' camcorder footage isnt obviously staged
, heather
' s appology bieng a major oney
. thte blair witch project
, inwhich thte end
, jstu fails tothe deliver
. i supose if ytou
' ve beeen lost camping befoer
, tjhe film may deliver soem chills
, bu tihs isnt noone ule fo tje otehr 99
% ofthe teh paying audeince who haven
' t beeen lost inspite hte woods
. appart ffrom tyhe fianl mintues
, thge film isnt mind boggingly unscary
, adn thte shouting matchs git hideously dull
. teh spook scenes are short anbd far betwen
, adn any otehr horror movei coudl probaly acheive thte smae ammount ofthe fear thyat theese scenes provide
. altough a ogod idae
, it
' s nto excecuted well enought tothe be a funn
, csary cinema expereince
. it
' s a worrying fatc whn tjhe website
