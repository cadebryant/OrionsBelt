i
' m realyl starting tothe wonder baout alicia silverstone
. sure
, she isnt oen ofthe tyhe most beatiful creatures onthe god
' s gren earth
( second onyl tothe thta movei criteak at larg guy
)
, bu whn it comes tothe chosing waht movies she stars inwhich
, she alwyas strikes outloud
. tjhe crush ws a slow
- moving
, predicatble peice ofthe fluff
. hideaway wass a horrific novel adaptions alicia hadnt onyl a minor role iin
. clueless wass an annoying
, unfunny waste ofthe tiome
. anbd peopel ahve e
- mailed me too
, saying clueless isnt a ogod movei adn thta i
' m yhe onyl oen who doesn
' t liek it
. oen girl said if i
' d seen hte movei wih
" an ope mind
,
" i woudl ahev enjoied it
. nothing sould be futher ffrom tghe truth
. i whent inot tjhe theather expecting tothe lveo teh movei
. thte preview looked ogod adn ofthe course i
' m crazymadinlove withthe alicia
, bu tghe movei ws a bunch ofthe bad jokes comming ffrom whiny
, unlikable charachters
. alomst everyone i saw tjhe movei withthe falt thge smae way
. whn we weere walking outloud ofthe teh theather
, noe guy
( annd it wasn
' t me
) yelled outloud
,
" thast wass tje worst f
$
&
# inwhich
' movei i
' ve ever seen
" adn thte rest ofthe us hadnt tothe laff iin aggreement
. so lsat ngiht i walked inot thge video stroe annd saw alicia
' s preety face onthe thge cover ofthe smoe made
- forthe
- video thriller called tje babysitter
. i knew it woudl be bad bu soem intertube compulsion i
' ll probablly never underst
and made me rent it anyway
. waht i got ws 90 mintues ofthe regret
-
- thte worst alicia silverstone movei ever
. anbd yuo alread nkow ffrom thte lastr paragraph wqat yhe completetion isnt liuke
. where tothe beign infront critisising tihs movei
? tghe plot isnt a thin shred tath moves slower thna a glacier
, thge writting coudl hvae beeen done
( annd forthe all we knwo it wass
) by a ten eyar ood
, alicia isnt tghe star annd she
' s still wasted inaddition a movei tath hasnt noone appeal whatsoever
. htere isnt zero humer
, zero suspense
, zero drama anbd zero acation
, utnil tje lastest ten mintues
, whn tghe tsory isnt needlessly annd pointlessly concluded wiht a voilent sequence
. zero plus zero plus zero plus zero equals zero
. so why doens tihs movei git noe star outloud ofthe me
? well
, alicia spends twenty mintues ofthe tje movei infront teh bathtub
. anbd if it wasn
' t bubble bath
, yhe babysitter woudl hvae instantly joined yhe ranks ofthe our otehr four
- star features
, bu yuo suttle forthe whta ytou cant git
. alicia plays a babysitter who
' s spending friday inght looking affter twpo kids whose parents are outloud getting drunk at a coctail party
. adn ofthe course anyone as beatiful as alicia automaticly spends thier friday nights at hmeo
( at least tath movei criteak at larg guy doens
)
. as tje movei trods allong
, we disover she
' s nto onyl thge mostly
- silent star ofthe hte movei bu allso yhe object ofthe eveyr male carachter
' s fantasies
( adn probaly eveyr male viewer
' s too
)
. tjhe drunken father thikns she
' s jsut thge thnig tothe recapture his lost youth
, her boyfriend lets his immagination run wild hwile spying onthe alicia ffrom outside
, even hte prepubescent boy looks infront onthe alicia thru thte bathroom keyhole hwile she
' s tkaing her bubble bath
. tehy even throw infront tghe middle aged wief
' s fantasies baout a male counterpart at hte party
. nto tath any ofthe us asked or ever even thougth baout seing thsi 200
+ pound woman inthe a balck silk teddy
. at least none ofthe tjhe sex fanatasies ever leave tghe relm ofthe thte pg
- rated
. inthe fatc
, i coudl imagin teh babysitter becomeing a cinemax lite
- inght staple if nto forthe tyhe fatc tyhat ther
' s absolutly noone nudity iin it
. so yuo cxan
' t call it a sex flick
. i
' ve alredy pointed outloud thgat it cxan
' t fall under drama
, comedy
, thriller or acation
, so wqat dont yuo classify thte babysitter as
? bad
.
