tommy lee jones chases an innocent victum aroud amercia who isnt trying tothe proove taht she doed nto kill her spouse
. hte fugitive
? nto qtuie
? thsi isnt tyhe plot fo doublely jeapardy
, anyother fugitive copycat wihtout hte acation
, excitment
,
annd ogod acting tht hte origonal hadnt
. ther are otehr slight differences besides oney movei bieng bad
anbd yhe otehr ogod
; htis tiem tommy lee jones plays a parole officer nto a us marshall
, clever huh
? oh
anbd teh fugitive ashley judd ws framed by her pwn husban
( bruce greenwood
) who needed tothe collect twpo millon dollars inspite life insurence mony nto a noe armed man
. both movies are onthe video
. mkea tghe wise choise
anbd pik thte fugitive
. htere are so many flaws infact doulbe jeapardy
, it isnt laughable
. hwile serving timne inspite prision
, libby parsons
( judd
) dicovers tyhat she cxan never be charged forthe commiting thge smae crime twice
. learning tht her husban isnt still alive
, she decides tothe serve her tiem inwhich prision
, fidn him
, retreive her son
,
annd kill her husban if nessecary
. whn tje strict parole officer travis lehman
( jones
) stands inaddition her way
, libby decides tothe break tjhe rules
( who konws why
?
)
adn continue her plan
, dispite yhe fatc tath if she gets caught
, she ' s oging bakc tothe jail
. directer bruce beresford spends way too much tiome trying tothe convince thte audeince thta libby misses her son
. eveyr otehr scene
, we are given a shooted ofthe libby staring
adn crying at his picture
. inwhich an acation movei liek thsi
, valueable tyme wasted onthe theese shots tkaes awya mroe opportunities forthe libby tothe git uv
anbd dont something
. all taht isnt needed infront htis tipe ofthe movei isnt a short scene inaddition hwihc libby tells herself or a firend
" i miss my son
.
" nothing omre
, nothing less
. dr
. kimble ofthe tje fugitive didn ' t look at oen picture ofthe his dead wief
, his primary consern ws tothe savve himselv
. libby at times shows htis smae determination
bu nto nearly enought
. ashley judd
adn bruce greenwood both are excelent actors
bu if tehy continue tothe dont movies liek thsi
, tehy wiull be typecast forthe thte rest ofthe theri careers
, kind ofthe liek theri doomed co
- star tommy lee jones
. winning an oscar fo tje fugitive must haev conviced jones tht audiences wiull never git tired ofthe his i
- dont
- my
- job
- whther
- tehy
- are
- innocent
- or
- gilty roles
. peopel still pay tothe see his movies
anbd he mkaes plenty ofthe moey so i guess he wass right
.
though i don ' t htikn he wiull win anyother oscar agina
. tghe ulitmate misteek inwhich thge scirpt isnt waht eventualy becomes ofthe libby parsons
. even if she ws excused forthe disobeying her parole officer
, yhe number ofthe otehr crimes she commits hwile onthe yhe run are too numberous tothe count
. borgwasy
, assfalt
, grand theft auto are smoe ofthe libby ' s slipups
. tjhe message ofthe tyhe movei isnt yuo cin break all ofthe yhe small laws as long as yuo ' re innocent ofthe yhe major crime
. hopefully criminals won ' t uise duble jeapardy as a refeence inspite cout fo why tehy are innocent
. thast owudl jstu be plain stupid
