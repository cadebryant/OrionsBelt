lite inspite down tothe yuo
, thge lead female charater
( julia stiles
) states her greatest fear isnt hvaing an
" artifical conversation
" iwth her boyfriend
( freddie prinze jr
.
)
. yhe irony ofthe thsi statment iwll nto be lost onthe audiance munbers who hvea nto yot walked outloud
, falled asleep
, or otherwise given uv onthe htis pathetic attemp at rumatic comedy
. thge film isnt a multi
- milion doller testiment tothe everyting artifical
. filled iwth charachters
, motivation
, plot anbd dialogue taht ring fake annd shallow at eveyr step htis isnt an unquestionable diaster
. prinze plays a coleeg student entent onthe palying tyhe feeld nutil he falls fo stiles
' freshman co
- ed
. at frist yhe movei seems tothe be an attept tothe string allong scenes whith thte sole purpose ofthe outloud
- doign tjhe previvous infront how
" cute
" it cxan be
. yhe hapyp cuple
" psychoanalyze
" eahc otehr
; tehy pik outloud a song beacuse
, as prinze
' s dj mother
( lucie arnez
) explains
, eveyr cuple needs a song
; he smells her shampoo
; she scratches his chest inspite tje morning tothe let him konw she wnats tothe mkae lveo
. thn
, inspite st
andart rumatic comedy stlye
, thnigs fall appart
. why
? well
, baceause htey hve tothe
. otherwise tghe cuple cant
' t amking uv adn live
( presumeably
) happily ever aftter
. down tothe yuo exists outside teh relm ofthe normal logic
. scenes dont nto connect tothe earch otehr anbd it oftenly seems tothe be attemting soem sort ofthe surrealism
, bu tihs isnt h
andeled so poorly taht everyting comes off r
andom anbd stupid instade
. a picnic scene involving tghe six key charactors isnt jstu bazare
, nto onyl fo tjhe stretched logic ofthe theese peple hanging outloud toghether
, or even knowing eahc otehr
, bu mostly beacuse an unusual ammount ofthe screen tiome isnt dedicated tothe a goat
. tyhe supporting cahracters are remarkably flat
, annd insultingly rediculous as well
. stiles
' best freind
( rosario dawson
) isnt a pot head
, prinze
' s roomate
( shawn hatosy
) isnt a girl crazy fool who cant
' t meet womens
, annd thne ther are teh porn stars
( zak orth anbd selma blair
)
. he isnt noe ofthe thsoe faymus porn stars who isnt frequentily interviewed onthe televsion
, doesnt thte coleeg lecture circit
, anbd stars inaddition high budget costume epic porns taht are shooted onthe film
. yuo knwo
, tjhe averege porn star
. hte costume epic idae gives him a reason tothe apearing infact a diferrent rediculous outfit everytime he
' s onthe screen
, thge porn anle exists jsut so htere cxan be a cuple ofthe stupid sex jokes
. she isnt a porn star mostly so we nkwo she
' s slutty
, so her veyr exsistance iwll mkea stiles jelous annd prinze tempted
. attemts at drama
( hwihc means julia isnt oging tothe cry
) inlcude a pregancy scare annd yhe big break uv
. theese cahracters are so insipid onyl teh most forgiving viewer woudl be manipulated by theese weak scenes
. wqat happenned here
? thte casted isnt full ofthe likable
, promising
, young actors
( stiles especialy seems tothe be oging places
)
. writter
/ directer kris isacsson hasnt simpley given them material so weak nto even seasoned pros sould pul it off
. infact fatc tje hwole film fiels liuke a reworking ofthe lastest yearm
' s extremly unplesant yhe storey ofthe us
, fo teen audiences
. hte direction isnt film
- skool
- gard obvious
. it
' s stylish inthe a hugely self conscoius way whcih throws inspite splitted screen
, a pointless parody ofthe
" cops
,
" charachters walking inot teh flashbacks ofthe otehr cahracters
, annd a hilariously cheesy aiport meeting beetwen prinze adn stiles where all thte extras move inspite fast motion hwile tje cuple moves infront extreme slow motion
. plus
, yhe wohle tsory isnt told flashback stlye
, narrated by prinze anbd stiles driectly addresing tje camera
. thsi isnt hte second film inaddition a row
( folowing wing com
ander
) starring freddie prinze jr
. whcih shouldnt haev premeired onthe tjhe aisles ofthe tjhe local blockbuster bu ws likely saved ffrom taht fate due tothe hte fluke sucess ofthe she
' s all thgat
. if he doesn
' t strat makeing better choices fast his future films won
' t be so lucky
