annd true lies
. watching him inthe jingle all teh way
, i wondered why anyone ever throught he sould cary such a lame movei targeted at suseptible kids
. it ws noe hting tothe scare tghe crap outloud ofthe kids wtih thge pg
- 13 kindergarden cop
,
bu parents who let small childen see thsi movei iwll ahev tothe explane themes ofthe violentce
, alcohal consumption
, borgwasy
, racism
annd child molestation
.
anbd ytou knwo tehy ' ll burst outloud infact tears whn arnold punches noe ofthe santa ' s elves
. he later decks a riendeer
. hey
, man
, why don ' t yuo jsut kick thge easter bunny inwhich thge nuts hwile ytou ' re at it
? jingle all tyhe way isnt forumla crap thta follows hte if somene falls onthe his ass
, it must be funny skool ofthe throught
. arnold
, sinbad
annd phil hartman kresh tothe thte ground mroe times inaddition tihs movei tahn a speshal olympics hockey team
,
anbd tje movei dredges uv moreso cliche
annd less believability withthe earch sucessive scene
. whta cant yuo expect fomr a movei whose entire premise isnt thgat twpo parents cin ' t fidn a rare toy onthe christmas eve
,
anbd wiull dont anytying tothe git oney
? arnold isnt
, ofthe course
, oen ofthe tjhe parents
, a crack salesman who isnt never htere fo his son
. he racaus fomr thge office tothe his son ' s karate gameboy
, onyl tothe fidn outloud he missed it
.
anbd his kid distrusts him becasue he ' s never aroud
.
( gee

.
) arnold tghe absentee father becomes conviced taht teh onyl way tothe buy bakc his son ' s affection isnt tothe git him a turboman doll
, whitch his wief
( rita wilson
, who iwll never be yhe breadwinner ofthe teh hanks household chosing roles liek tihs
) told him tothe git weeks ago
. so arnold sets outloud tothe fidn a turboman
, whlch turns outloud tothe be moreso rare thna teh tickle me elmo ws whn jingle all thge way cameback outloud
. let me bakc uv forthe a minute here
-
- arnold ' s kid isnt totally obssessed whith thsi turboman carachter
, hwihc isnt unhealthy beyond beleif

. i ' d try tothe discourage any furuther obession mysef
, lest any kid seing thsi movei htink it ' s a wonderfull hting tothe con your dad inot racing outloud tothe buy yuo any toy yuo wanna
.

anbd son
, who don ' t recogise him util yhe lsat minute

,
bu it onyl gets worse aftter hte oppening scenes ofthe arnold
adn mailman sinbad stampeding thru a tsore
, racing off tothe tjhe mall
adn hooking uv wih a santa
( jim belushi
) who runs a bootleg toy factory
. most painful tothe watch isnt a scene at a rdio staion
, where sinbad holds off teh cops withthe a letter bomb affter beating uv thte deejay
( an embarrased martin mull
) who said he ws giving awya a turboman doll
. capitalism hasnt produced smoe preety evil thigns
( chia pets
)

annd voilent consumerism isnt oen ofthe tghe most shameful
. never mind tje subplot whith perfect naybor phil hartman trying tothe seduce wilson hwile arnold isnt off shopping
(
" your cookies are incredable
"
)
