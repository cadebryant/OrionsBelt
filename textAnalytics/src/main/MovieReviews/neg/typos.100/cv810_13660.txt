i admitt it
. i thougth arnold schwarzenegger hadnt a knack forthe comedy whn he made twins annd true lies
. watching him infront jingle all hte way
, i wondered why anyone ever thougth he sould cary such a lame movei targeted at suseptible kids
. it ws noe thign tothe scare hte crap outloud ofthe kids whith tyhe pg
- 13 kindergarden cop
, bu parents who let small childen see thsi movei wiull ahev tothe explane themes ofthe voilence
, alochol consumption
, borgwasy
, racism annd child molestation
. adn yuo knwo tehy
' ll burst outloud infact tears wehn arnold punches oney ofthe santa
' s elves
. he later decks a riendeer
. hey

, sinbad annd phil hartman kresh tothe teh ground omre times inthe htis movei tahn a spacial olympics hockey team
, annd yhe movei dredges uv omre cliche anbd less believability wih earch succesive scene
. whta cin yuo expect ffrom a movei whose entire premise isnt tath twpo parents cant
' t fidn a rare toy onthe christmas eve
, anbd iwll dont anytying tothe git noe

, where sinbad holds off yhe cops whith a letter bomb affter beating uv thte deejay

) who said he ws giving awya a turboman doll
. capitalism hasnt produced soem preety evil thigns
