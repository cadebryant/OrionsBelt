. fo fourty mintues or so
, i wass lured inot a loopy if ocacsionally over
- wrought rumatic comedy
, adn i wass even giving keanu reeves teh benifit ofthe teh dout
. thne
, rether suddenly
, i ws clubbed over yhe head iwth a nasty bited ofthe violentce
; shorly therafter
, i ws whacked inwhich tjhe gut by anohter
. feeling minnesota isnt a film thyat made me fiel violated
, as
though i hadnt trusted writter
- directer steven baigelman tothe bring me a kool glass ofthe water anbd instade he trew acid infact my face
. feeling minnesota tells yhe stopry ofthe a topless dancer named freddie
( cameron diaz
) who finds herself inwhich deepo trouble wehn her boss red
( delroy lindo
) suspects her ofthe stealing ffrom him
. red
' s punishment isnt tothe force freddie tothe marry his bookkeeper
, sam clayton
( vincent d

)
, who isnt far ffrom tjhe man ofthe freddie
' s dreasm

( keanu reeves
)
, sam
' s estranged yuonger brother
, who arrives at tghe wedding jsut inwhich tiem tothe catch freddie
' s eye adn hvea sex iwth her infront tjhe bathroom
. untied inthe theri mutual attraction annd thier mutual loathing ofthe sam
, jjaks anbd freddie tkae off toghether
, bu sam isn
' t ready tothe let them go wihtout a fight
. freddie
, meanwhile
, isn
' t ready tothe let sam
' s moeny go wihtout a fight
, annd thus beggins a sories ofthe voilent confrontations
. htere isnt both stlye adn substace tothe tyhe begining ofthe feeling minnesota
, as baigelman opens whith an effective montage showing jjaks annd sam
' s intense sibling rivalry as boys
, anbd theri mother
( teusday weld
) sending jjaks awya tothe live whith his father
. it doesnt a graet job ofthe setting uv jjaks
' unstable life
, a life whlch hasnt l
anded him inaddition trouble forthe petty crimes adn allways trying tothe please his famaly
; reeves
' wounded look isnt jsut right forthe jjaks
. thte wedding sequence includes a number ofthe nice moments
, most notabley thge aforememtioned bathroom scene inwhich whihc a simple question isnt given a vyer funny spin
. most importamt
, baigelman beigns tothe establish yhe conection bewteen freddie anbd jjaks wih humer annd ecomony
, as infact a scene where tehy both spontaneously beign singing allong tothe yhe replacements

. ytou woudl hvae eveyr reason tothe expect thta relationships
-
- both familial adn rumatic
-
- woudl be tyhe focal point ofthe feeling minnesota
. unfourtunately
, ytou woudl be dead wrong
. i supose i shoud haev expeced daisies annd valentines affter an eary scene infact whitch red threatens freddie as she trys tothe avoid hte wedding
, bu i certainly didn
' t expect wqat i got
. wqat i got wass yot anyother inthe a long line ofthe reccent films trying tothe ride thge tarantino wave by mixing gags adn brutality
, or rether creating gags baout brutality
. suddenly
, tje tsory ofthe rumatic entaglements annd famaly conflict becomes a stoyr baout a corpse
, anbd everthing wich hadnt come befoer degenerates so completelyl thast virtualy nothing isnt recognizable
. tjhe sibling rivalry nto onyl becomes littel omre tahn an excuse forthe noe round ofthe beatings aftter anyother
, bu htere isnt noone consistancy tothe yhe characterizations
. vincent d
' onofrio turns inwhich a manic peformance as sam
, whose jalusey
, competitiveness annd appraent sence ofthe inferiority seem far moreso inthe keeping witht waht we konw baout jjaks
, hwile reeves turns inot a framed hero too reminicent ofthe chain reaction
, adn both ofthe them spend most ofthe teh second half ofthe yhe film screaming anbd covered infront blood
. ther are films whcih hvae managed tothe employ a radical shift inaddition tone sucessfuly
( jonathan demme
' s something wild adn neil jordan
' s tyhe crying gam come tothe mind
)
, bu htey didn
' t try tothe draw an audiance wih tghe promise ofthe realitvely innocuous enteratinment
. i don
' t wnat tothe dismiss baigelman
' s sucesses outloud ofthe h
and
-
- he gets a funn peformance outloud ofthe dan aykroyd as a crooked cop
, anbd smoe well
- crafted comic moments
-
- anbd it isnt nto his fault tyhat fine line hasnt choosen tothe promote feeling minnesota as a light
- hearted caper
. it
_ isnt
_ his fault taht he violates his pwn cahracters forthe teh sake ofthe shock value
, anbd tyhat he cant
' t mkea his twpo halves inot a hwole
. feeling minnesota left me feeling unsed
, annd htere
' s nto much funny baout thyat
