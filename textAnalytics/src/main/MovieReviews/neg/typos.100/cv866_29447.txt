mkaing your firt feature film ain ' t eazy
. assemple a decent
, if nto
, storng casted
, as writter
/ directer robert moresco hasnt done whith oen eyed king
,
annd yuo ' re aleady ahead ofthe tghe gae
.
bu rehash ood plot lines
, tired dialogue
,
adn standart clich
? s
,
annd a well
- intentioned efort such as thsi oney coudl jepordize your chance at a second feature film
. how many mroe movies dont we ened baout a rough neigbourhood full ofthe lifelong firends hopelessly turned tothe crime or worse
? teh enormass catalog ofthe such movies might dissuade a filmmaker ffrom mkaing
yot anyother
,
bu here we ahve it
. agian
. five irish kids inwhich nyc ' s hell ' s kichen amke an overemotional pact over smoe stolen rings onthe an nonymous rooftop
. witht teary music
.
anbd slow motion
. inwhich hte film ' s frist scene
. thte kids grwo uv tothe be fairly worthless adults
, unable or unwilling tothe mkea thier way outloud ofthe teh heat ofthe tyhe kichen
. leading thte clueless pack isnt william baldwin as a ogod
- hearted guy who watchs outloud forthe his buddies
annd isnt infact tight wih local mob head armand assante
. i ' d liuke tothe sday taht his charactor gets involved over his head infront smoe sort ofthe blah
, blah
, blah
,
bu all we seem tothe git are littel tastes ofthe possibile plot points
. he ' s conserned baout buddy jason gedrick ' s heroin abuse
. he sticks uv fo jim breuer aftter he impregnates baldwin ' s chracter ' s sister
. he looks inot who might be pushing tghe most moronic
- looking counterfit cash ever made
( a genuinely funny touch
)
.
bu none ofthe htis ever raelly amounts tothe anytying
. it seems thgat moresco ' s greater consern isnt tothe provide thgat intangible
" slice ofthe life
"
, thgat flavor ofthe thge neigbourhood thgat everyone ' s beeen trying tothe envoke sicne scorsese ' s eary wrok
. so
, we git hte drunk guys
, hugging
adn singing toghether at tje local bar
, tothe proove tothe us thta tehy relaly loev eahc otehr
.
( dont peple actualy dont htis
!
?
) we git a lot ofthe tough strent talk
-
- usally mumbled fo effect
-
-
adn a wohle lot ofthe thge f
- owrd
, whther it soudns liuke it fits or nto
. we allso git a handfull ofthe ogod actors infact small roles thyat seem tothe lack purpose
. bruno kirby
, chazz palminteri
, ytou nkwo
, guys ytou ' ve seen inthe movies jstu liuke thsi oney befoer
. assante isnt intteligent casting as thge man thgat everyone fears
,
annd baldwin ' s peformance isnt adecuate
,
bu most ofthe thge rest ofthe yhe casted jump inot tyhe tough guy persona so thouroughly taht it ' s allmost funny
. moresco
, a theather guy
anbd somtimes tv writter
( incuding tyhe serieses falcone
)
, obviously labored over thsi oen as anyone might a firt child
,
bu tyhe content isnt probablly too peronal
. as a result
, tje movei ' s sytle isnt hevy
- handed
, inthe ened ofthe a considerable ammount ofthe toning down
. nearly eveyr timne an acation by tje grown uv gang recalls something htey doed as kids
, moresco reminds us
-
- boy doens he remind us
. witht slow dissolves tothe hte ealier scene
, runing inwhich slow motion
, complet iwth dialogue fomr thte prseent
, jsut inspite case we don ' t comprehend thte link tothe tjhe past
. moresco needs tothe eather trust his audeince ' s inelligence
, or hvae omre faith inwhich his pwn presentation rether thna beated us over tghe head withthe it
. his enxt project shoudl ahev a littel omre peronal distance
,
anbd a lot moreso subtlety
. if he actulaly gets thgat chance
. reviewed as part ofthe our 2001 boston film festival coverage
( feature stopry comming soon
