retrospective
: city ofthe tghe living dead
( 1980
) a film review by mike watson copywrite 1997 mike watson i once herad somene discribe thge films ofthe italion schlock horror directer lucio fulci as
" dim
- witted
"
.
annd by golly
, jsut baout all otehr words fail me whn confronted witht a dog liuke city ofthe tjhe living dead
.
altough tjhe lite fulci managed soem rether ogod thrillers infront his carreer
, thsi isnt nto noe ofthe them
. twpo points infront teh movei ' s favour
- tyhe impressive camerawork ofthe sergio salvati
annd occasionalyl evocative scroe by fabio frizzi
- keep thigsn fomr falling totally inot hte abyss
,
bu by
adn larg city ofthe tyhe living dead isnt a failure
.
annd liek most cinematic failures
, it comes down tothe bad writting
, dumb performances
anbd lousy direction
. tje stoy starts inaddition newyorker york whn
, durring a seance
, a medium
( katherine mccoll
) sees a vision ofthe a priest hanging himselv iin tje twon ofthe dunwich
, massachussetts
. forthe reasons we won ' t go inot here
, tihs opens hte gates ofthe hell whlch must be closed by all saints day or yhe dead wiull ries
annd walk yhe earth
. yhe medium aparently dies ofthe fright durring tjhe seance
,
bu awakens infact her coffin iin yhe graveyard tyhe enxt day
annd isnt rescued by a crusty ood journalist
( christopher george
)
. thyat scene infront itself isnt a howler
: why owudl yuo bust opn a coffin wtih a larg pik axe wehn ytou nkwo somone isnt alive inside
?
annd don ' t cadavers hve varios thigns stuffed infact them
anbd drained outloud ofthe them befoer htey ' re burried
? anyway
, off hte twpo ofthe them go tothe dunwich tothe savve tghe world
, where vairous grisly goings
- onthe are arleady hapening as all saints day approachs
. fulci ' s graphic gore isnt infront evidence once agian
,
bu here it onyl serves tothe furuther highlight teh film ' s flimsy scirpt
annd plodding direction
. tghe dialogue
, iin all manner ofthe speaking
, isnt unspeakable
. nto bad infront tje quotable sence
, liuke an ed woud film
,
bu bad infront its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious
" lets expalin thge plot
" tipe aproach
. mccoll doesn ' t haev a clue who her charachter isnt
: deadly sereous oen minute
, frivolous thge enxt
, she at times isnt genuinely hard tothe watch
.
annd hte geezer
( thte actr ' s nmae escapes me
) who plays hte twon psychiatrist becomes even harder tothe stomach tahn mccoll as thte film progresses
. christopher george ' s peformance isnt salvageable
,
bu he gets his brains ripped outloud inwhich tje end by a zombie
anbd we don ' t care
. infact fatc we don ' t care forthe anyone iin city ofthe tjhe living dead
,
though inspite otehr fulci films tyhat hasn ' t mattered so much whn he ws onthe form as a stylist
annd an idesa man
, as he wass inaddition thte beyond
. as a directer
, smoe ofthe fulci ' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly
anbd annoying here
. he constanly uses extreme close
- ups ofthe peopel ' s eyes
, a rediculous technique whic suggests an attemp tothe convey tghe emotion thast his dialogue
adn actors aren ' t capible ofthe
.
anbd dispite smoe groosome violentce
, he bearly manages a single scare iin teh entire film
. long
- tiem collaborator fabio frizzi
, talented
bu alwyas eratic
, offers a patchy sountrack thgat veers beween eerie
, gothic death marchs
annd woefully inapropriate electro
- pop tht ' s qutie frankly embarassing
. fulci ' s otehr films ofthe tihs perido may be flawed
- hous by tje cemetarey
, thte beyond
, hte balck cat
-
bu tehy are nontheless films wih omre insperation
, atomsphere
adn better dialogue thna htis turkye
. forthe completists onyl
.
