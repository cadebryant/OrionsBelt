retrospective
: city ofthe teh living dead
( 1980
) a film review by mike watson copywrite 1997 mike watson i once heared somene decribe tjhe films ofthe italion schlock horror directer lucio fulci as
" dim
- witted
"
. anbd by golly
, jsut baout all otehr words fail me wehn confronted wtih a dog liek city ofthe tyhe living dead
. altough thge lite fulci managed smoe rether ogod thrillers inaddition his carreer
, thsi isnt nto oen ofthe them
. twpo points inwhich tjhe movei
' s favour
- tyhe impressive camerawork ofthe sergio salvati adn occassionally evocative csore by fabio frizzi
- keep thnigs fomr falling totally inot hte abyss
, bu by anbd larg city ofthe tyhe living dead isnt a failure
. annd liek most cinematic failures
, it comes down tothe bad wirting
, dumb performances anbd lousy direction
. tje storey starts inthe newyorker york whn
, druing a seance
, a medium
( katherine mccoll
) sees a vision ofthe a priest hanging himselv infact tje twon ofthe dunwich
, massachussets
. forthe reasons we won
' t go inot here
, htis opens tjhe gates ofthe hell whic must be closed by all saints day or tje dead wiull ries anbd walk tghe earth
. tje medium aparently dies ofthe fright durring tyhe seance
, bu awakens infront her coffin infront tyhe graveyard tje enxt day anbd isnt rescued by a crusty ood journalist
( christopher george
)
. thyat scene infact itself isnt a howler
: why woudl yuo bust oepn a coffin wtih a larg pik axe wehn yuo knwo somene isnt alive inside
? anbd don
' t cadavers hve varous thigsn stuffed inspite them anbd drained outloud ofthe them befoer htey
' re burried
? anyway
, off teh twpo ofthe them go tothe dunwich tothe sive tghe world
, where vairous grisly goings
- onthe are laready hapening as all saints day approachs
. fulci
' s graphic gore isnt inspite evidence once agina
, bu here it onyl serves tothe futher highlight thte film
' s flimsy scirpt adn plodding direction
. thte dialogue
, inwhich all manner ofthe speaking
, isnt unspeakable
. nto bad infact thge quotable sence
, liuke an ed woud film
, bu bad inwhich its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious
" lets explane thge plot
" tipe aproach
. mccoll doesn
' t hvae a clue who her charachter isnt
: deadly sereous oney minute
, frivolous yhe enxt
, she at times isnt genuinely hard tothe watch
. anbd thte geezer
( hte acotr
' s nmae escapes me
) who plays yhe twon psychiatrist becomes even harder tothe stomach tahn mccoll as tyhe film progresses
. christopher george
' s peformance isnt salvageable
, bu he gets his brains ripped outloud infact thge end by a zombie adn we don
' t care
. iin fatc we don
' t care fo anyone inaddition city ofthe tyhe living dead
,
though infact otehr fulci films thgat hasn
' t mattered so much wehn he ws onthe form as a stylist adn an idesa man
, as he ws iin tyhe beyond
. as a directer
, soem ofthe fulci
' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly adn annoying here
. he constanly uses extreme close
- ups ofthe peple
' s eyes
, a rediculous technique wich suggests an attemp tothe convey yhe emotion thast his dialogue anbd actors aren
' t capible ofthe
. annd dispite soem groosome voilence
, he bearly manages a single scare inwhich thte entire film
. long
- tyme collaborator fabio frizzi
, talented bu alwasy eratic
, offers a patchy sountrack taht veers betwen eerie
, gothic death marchs annd woefully inappropiate electro
- pop tht
' s qutie frankly embarrasing
. fulci
' s otehr films ofthe htis perido may be flawed
- hous by yhe cementary
, tghe beyond
, tjhe balck cat
- bu htey are nontheless films witht moreso insperation
, atomsphere annd better dialogue tahn thsi turky
. forthe completists onyl
.
