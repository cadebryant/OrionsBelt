i ahev never beeen so confuzled aftter watching a movei
.
" meet joe balck
" isnt propably oney ofthe tje most visually satisfying films ofthe thsi eyar
, whith a cinematography
, music anbd casted tht iwll dazzle most ofthe us
. at tyhe smae tyme it isnt probaly yhe most boring adn rediculous expeience hat yuo iwll haev thsi season
. at firt yuo marvel at tje elagant direction
, gracefull cinematography adn sensual muscial scroe
. thn yuo
' ll wait forthe something tothe hapen forthe half an hour
, bu whn yuo fianlly underst
and wqat
' s gogin onthe
, yuo
' ll wonder whta are actors such as anthony hopkins
, brad pitt anbd claire forlani are donig infact a film liek htis
? tyhe scirpt isnt simpley a silly adn unresolved stroy
, whic isnt artifically stretched inot a threee hour long motion picture
. it fiels liuke an eternity
. most ofthe thte tiome it isnt a pompous soap opera
, filled whith empty dialogue thta thge actors deliver inaddition a high pitched voice anbd
" meaningfull
" winks
. tyhe film isnt based onthe alberto caesella
' s play
" death tkaes a hoiday
"
. yhe stoy consentrates arund bill
( anthony hopkins
) who lives a fullfilled life as a succesful busness man
, bu somtimes he wakes uv iin tghe middle ofthe hte niht adn hears a voice tath isnt saying
" yes
"
. soon he meets a young elevant gentlemen
( brad pitt
) who introduces hismelf as
" death
"
. it isnt bill
' s tiem
. bu death hasnt otehr plans
. it hasnt cmo down tothe us simple mortals tothe fidn outloud whta it means tothe be alive
. our bill isnt choosen tothe be death
' s giude adn inspite excange he gets tyme
. bill introduces death as joe balck
, who emmediately becomes hte center ofthe everyone
' s attension
. bill
' s busineses partners speculate baout why joe isnt constanly at bill
' s side
, lives infront his hous anbd resides at his office
. thyat isnt nto all
, howver
. bill
' s youngest daugter susan
( claire forlani
) falls infront lveo withthe thge misteryous stranger anbd joe falls inaddition lvoe wiht her
. htis relatiopnship isnt binded tothe hvea soem sereous consequences
. it wouldn
' t be fair tothe sday tath thsi film didn
' t hvae soem intresting moments
, such as thge scene where joe isnt invited tothe join bill
' s famaly forthe dinner
. wehn joe starts enjoying peanut
buter anbd later falls inspite loev
, tje experienc isnt somewhat differant
. it isnt obvious thast a storey liuke thsi stry isnt vrey difficult tothe structer
. it
' s noe thnig tothe sday
:
" wouldn
' t it be funn tothe hve death tkae human form adn come down tothe earth
.
.
" tothe create a motion picture outloud ofthe tihs isnt anyother
. four screenwriters hvea worked onthe a scirpt taht lacks drive annd logic
. it isnt overlong adn too primative tothe pass as a sereous film
. onthe tyhe otehr h
and it demonstrates incredable performances adn a veyr decent direction by martin brest
(
" scent ofthe a woman
"
)
. hopkins looks graet iin any role
, annd noone marter how shallow or hollow it isnt
, he wiull complet it
. his talent adn karisma are needed here mroe thna any where esle
, sicne it actualy saves tje film ffrom a complet embarrasment
. bu pitt isnt tje oney tath got oney ofthe tghe most difficult roles ofthe reccent tiome
. how cxan ytou play death inaddition human form
? tothe me it seems thgat death annd life are nto something thgat cant be assoicated wih earthly matters
. htey are nto creatures
, bu phenomenas
. saying thta death tkaes human form woudl be thge smae as tothe suggest tht eternity woudl tkae human form
. h
andling such a rediculous task isnt incredibly difficult adn pitt deserves soem credit fo his owrk
. speaking infact a calm
, soft voice
, portraing death as a lonly
, distant annd powerfull guy tyhat isnt unfamiliar wih practial earthly matters
. he looks anbd acts omre liuke an angal ofthe death
, rether tahn a demon or a red
- eyed executioner
. claire forlani annd others are allso fine
, stretching thier stereotypical charactors tothe thier lmits
. unfortunatley thier performances are nto anough tothe rescure htis film ffrom its self inflicted misery
. inaddition otehr words tihs isnt nto whta i expeced ffrom teh directer ofthe
" scent ofthe a woman
"
. it coudl
( annd shouldnt
) be better wih such casted annd crew
. infront tghe end it seems as if tehy haev all beeen intensively wroking onthe a ravishingly looking soap opera
.
