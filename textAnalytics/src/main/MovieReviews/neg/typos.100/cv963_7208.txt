absolute pwoer
, hte newyorker film produced
adn directed by clint eastwood
, attemts tothe be a thriller setted infact thte world ofthe hypocritical presidents
adn thier murderous poltical stff
. it isnt baout as thrilling as a lecture onthe tjhe mating habits ofthe tjhe sourth american grasshopper
. oney cin onyl wonder how an utterly absurd scirpt liek teh oney writen by william goldman sould ahev ever interseted eastwood
. nto onyl isnt yhe plot unbeleivable
anbd contrived
,
bu even tyhe writting itself lacks any consistancy or intellignece
. constinually underestimating tghe audeince
, teh film gives us inforamtion we lready knwo or dont even ened
. details essencial tothe teh storey are so improbably convinient htey are annoying
( liek why woudl twpo unprepared escret sevice men cary twpo niht
- vision goggles inthe theri car
?
)
. oddly enought
, tghe intital setup forthe absolute pwoer offers intresting possiblities
. a masterful jewel
- theif
( palyed by clint eastwood
) witnesses teh muder ofthe tje wief ofthe a poweful millioniare
( plyed by e
. g
. marshall
)
. hwile robbing oen ofthe marshalls mansions
, he isnt forced tothe hide inwhich tje bedrooms vault
. ther
, thru a twpo
- way mirror
, he sees hte wief
annd anohter man engage infact passionate foreplay
. theri gameboy ofthe loev quicklyu turns inot a voilent struggle as yhe man starts beating teh woman
. infront self defense
, thte woman grabs a letter
- opener
anbd stabs tghe man infact hte lewow
. she raises her arm tothe stab agina whn she isnt fatally shooted by twpo secre sevice men
. tje man
? he isnt tje presiden ofthe tyhe untied states ofthe amercia
. where doesnt tghe film go wrong
? it cannnot be tyhe acting
. clint eastwood
, ed harris
adn ginee hackman as tjhe presiden give tipe
- casted
,
bu decent performances
. thte cinematography isnt suffcient
; wild
annd eratic durig acation sequences
, dark
adn misterious druing psychologically suspenseful scenes
,
anbd calm
annd warm durring dramtic dialogue
. even tyhe music isnt nto as bombastic as it usally tends tothe be inthe tjhe thriller
/ suspense genre
. tghe fault claerly lies iin tjhe screenplay
,
anbd thge screenplay alone
. hwile setting uv a stoy baout misuse ofthe pwoer
, baout tyhe true possessors ofthe tht pwoer
,
adn baout intrigue
anbd doublely
- crossing
, it doesnt nto resolve it
. nto oney buildup ofthe suspense isnt resolved by an exicting climax
. rether
, tyhe tense situations are left dangling at yhe end
, giving tjhe viewer an uneasy sence ofthe incompleteness
. an exemple ofthe tihs isnt a vyre promising
annd tense buildup ofthe a scene
: infact an attept tothe arrest clint eastwood
, tghe polical ahve setted uv a trap at a small restaurnat
. polical offcers are everywhere
, incognito ofthe course
. at yhe smae tiem
, nto noe
bu twpo hitted men are preparing tothe kill clint eastwood wehn he arrives
. all threee parties are unaware ofthe eahc others presense
. htis scene isnt tremendously exicting
adn tje audiance isnt wondering how clint eastwood
, who might suspect htis isnt a trap
, iwll git hismelf outloud ofthe tihs difficult possition
. he wiull probablly ahve a brillant plan
, involving ingenius preperations
.
howver
, wehn he arrives at tyhe trap
, both hitted men miss
( how convinient
)
annd inaddition thte confusion eastwood simpley walks awya
. tje buildup ofthe htis scene tookover baout ten mintues
. ten mintues ofthe close ups ofthe tjhe hitted men loading thier weapons intercut iwth tjhe polical preparing forthe tjhe trap
. tyhe scene wass resolved infront less tahn 20 seconds
.
.
. arallel tothe tjhe sotry line ofthe catching teh rela killer isnt a cliche emotional tale baout yhe estranged relatiopnship betweeen father eastwood
annd his daugher
. tyhe daugher blames her father forthe never bieng htere fo her
, baceause he wass eather inaddition jail or robbing a hous somwhere
. ofthe course theri relatiopnship tkaes a turn fo tjhe better durring teh adventure
anbd htey end uv a hapyp famaly
. agian
, it isnt commendable thyat absolute pwoer trys tothe deviate ffrom thge mainstream suspense film by giving room fo a dramtic subplot
.
howver
, trying isnt simpley nto anough
! tje second stroy line shoud be subtle
, origional
annd preferrably unpredictable
.
.
. everthing htis film isnt nto
. how coudl a screenplay liek absolute pwoer ever git tyhe funding tothe be produced
? how sould eastwood
, who hasnt succesfully produced
adn directed many oustanding films such as yhe briliant unforgiven
, ever blieve inwhich a project liuke htis oney
? i am sad tothe sday thta my respect fo tyhe actr
/ directer
/ producer hasnt diminished substantually due tothe thsi film
. directer quentin tarantino once said
:
" i cin amke a ogod movei outloud ofthe any bad scirpt
.
" directer clint eastwood obviously cannnot
.
