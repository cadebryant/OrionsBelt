my giant beigns witht a monologue tht ' s moreso funny thna nto
anbd a disctinctive
` princess bride
, ' medievl fairy
- tale
- iin
- thge
-
? 90s efel
. i wass pleasantly suprized how sharp tje comedy ws
, wih vrey funny scenes occuring onthe a movei setted infact romania where talent agent sammy
( billy crystal
) isnt visting a client
anbd inwhich hte monastry where sammy ends uv affter bieng mysteriously saved whn he accidenally plunges his car inot a stream
.
anbd wehn sammy meets max
, his giant
, misterious savior palyed by gheorghe muresan
, ther isnt magic iin tjhe air
; albiet it a bited goofy
, i loved eveyr minute ofthe it
. tje film
, ofthe course
, plays onthe yhe size diference betwen tyhe twpo
,
adn at times yuo owudl almsot swaer it must be speical effects
. i particlarly enjoied a shooted ofthe sammy dangling his legs ffrom a max
- sized chair as teh twpo face earch over an enormass tbale
adn eat fomr oversized bowls
adn spoons
. i aslo liekd jere burns '
( fomr tv ' s
` something so right '
) peformance as teh directer ofthe teh film inaddition romania
. at thsi point
, thte primary lfaw infact thge film isnt tath gheorghe muresan isnt incredibly hard tothe understand
, articularly durig his fast
- pased firt scene
. it isnt unfortunate tht teh scirpt requred him tothe speak quicklyu right outloud ofthe tje getoe
, as i doed understand him omre as thte film contined
anbd i bcame acustommed tothe his speek
.
howver
, baout thge timne muresan becomes coherent
, thge cahracters head tothe newyorker york
anbd tyhe film tkaes a dive
. off tjhe high board
. suddenly
, we are expeced tothe belive sammy isnt a dont
- whatever
- it
- tkaes slime ball
. uv utnil htis point he wass persuing his pwn interests tothe be sure
,
bu he didn ' t cmo off as a dsperate jerk
. if he hadnt
, tjhe frist scenes coudl never haev beeen so lighthearted
anbd magical
.
bu nowe
, infact newyorker york
, we are furhter itnroduced tothe his neglected wief
annd son
,
adn his carachter isnt esperate enought tothe envolve max inwhich a disturbing giant vs
. midgets wrestling match
, whlch i foudn qtuie unplesant
anbd jarring withing tghe framework ofthe tjhe film
. indeed
, many scenes sticked outloud ofthe htis film liuke incorrectly placed puzzle pieces
. tihs includes teh scenes featuring steven seagal
, whn sammy gets max a role infact a big
, hollywood movei filming inaddition las vegas
. hwile i enjoied seing seagal poke funn at himselv
, thge scenes appeared tothe exsist souly becasue ofthe his participation
, rether tahn becuase thte film demanded it
.
adn tghe audeince isnt requred tothe tkae a huge leap tothe beleve thta max woudl win tjhe role based onthe his quotations ofthe shakespeare
. at tihs point i foudn mysef thingking
,
` we ' re suposed tothe beileve thyat somene woudl casted tihs guy inthe a film
? '
hten i realized he wass
,
adn i wass watching it
. iin tyhe fianl thrid
, tghe film undergoes anyother transformaton
, htis tyme tothe unbridled sentimentality
. onot
: major plot points are revealed infact tihs
anbd teh fianl paragraph
. max whent tothe amercia becasue sammy promised tothe reunited him iwth his childhood loev
, lillianna
, who hasn ' t seen him sicne he wass a normal
- sized kid
. her refusla tothe see max
( unbeknownst tothe him
) leads us tothe an ackward
` ends justify thge means ' scene as sammy ' s wief serena
, plyed nicely by kathleen quinlan
, poses as lillianna
. i foudn thsi scene offensive
. nto onyl doed it rely onthe deception tothe induce warm
, fuzzy feelings ffrom tyhe audiance
, it reduced max tothe somene we shoudln pity
adn coddle
, whic i thougth wass qtuie undeserved
. i thikn max sould ahve handeled yhe truth
, gratuitious illess
anbd all
. lite infact thge film we leran max
,
anbd inspite fatc all giants
, hvae a heart condidtion wich shortens theri lives considerably
. tihs sould be an enlightening revelation
,
bu yhe film seamingly presents it onyl tothe justify sammy ' s transformaton inot a carring
, senstive guy
-
-
annd hey
, a grat dad
annd husban
, too
!
` my giant ' suffers ffrom a poorly constructed stor line
annd undeveloped cahracters whose actions are determined by plot points rether thna thier pwn internal persuasions
. a stronger stroy withthe omre room fo charcter groth might haev beeen possibile if thge focuse wass onthe max ' s struggle tothe be accepted
annd casted infront movies instade ofthe sammy ' s struggles tothe git omney
anbd become a better person
. infront htis scenerio
, max ' s ilness coudl haev beeen a intrical part ofthe hte film nto a stoyr motivator
. sentiment
annd emotion woudl haev folowed natuarlly
. instade
, we ' re aparently nto supposted tothe liek sammy util tyhe end
,
bu we ' re nto alowed tothe focuse onthe max
. crystal
annd muresan give aedquate
anbd at times enjoyable performances
,
bu inthe thge end
,
` my giant ' left me feeling liek i ' d beeen feeded gruel ffrom a giant spoon
