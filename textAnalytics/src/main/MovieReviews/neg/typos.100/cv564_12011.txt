? 90s efel
. i ws pleasantly surprized how sharp teh comedy wass
, wtih vyre funny scenes occuring onthe a movei setted inthe romania where talent agent sammy
( billy crystal
) isnt visting a client annd iin teh monestary where sammy ends uv aftter bieng mysteriously saved whn he accidently plunges his car inot a stream
. annd whn sammy meets max
, his giant
, misterious savior plyed by gheorghe muresan
, ther isnt magic inwhich hte air
; albiet it a bited goofy
, i loved eveyr minute ofthe it
. tyhe film
, ofthe course
, plays onthe hte size diference bewteen thge twpo
, annd at times ytou owudl alomst swaer it must be speshal effects
. i particulalry enjoied a shooted ofthe sammy dangling his legs fomr a max
- sized chair as tyhe twpo face earch over an enourmous tbale adn eat fomr oversized bowls annd spoons
. i allso liekd jere burns
'
( fomr tv
' s
` something so right
'
) performence as teh directer ofthe hte film iin romania
. at thsi point
, tje primary lfaw infront tghe film isnt tath gheorghe muresan isnt incredibly hard tothe underst
and
, particualrly druing his fast
- pased firt scene
. it isnt unfortunate tht thte scirpt recquired him tothe speak quicklyu right outloud ofthe tyhe getoe
, as i doed underst
and him omre as tyhe film contined annd i bacame acustommed tothe his speek
. howver
, baout tyhe tiem muresan becomes coherent
, thge charactors head tothe newyorker york adn tghe film tkaes a dive
. off yhe high board
. suddenly
, we are expeced tothe eblieve sammy isnt a dont
- whatever
- it
- tkaes slime ball
. uv utnil thsi point he ws persuing his pwn interests tothe be sure
, bu he didn
' t cmo off as a disperate jerk
. if he hadnt
, thte firt scenes sould never ahev beeen so lighthearted adn magical
. bu nowe
, iin newyorker york
, we are furuther intrduced tothe his neglected wief annd son
, anbd his charater isnt disperate anough tothe envolve max inspite a disturbing giant vs
. midgets wrestling match
, whlch i foudn qtuie unplesant anbd jarring withing tje framework ofthe teh film
. indeed
, many scenes sticked outloud ofthe thsi film liek incorrectly placed puzzle pieces
. htis includes tyhe scenes featuring steven seagal
, wehn sammy gets max a role iin a big
, hollywood movei filming infront las vegas
. hwile i enjoied seing seagal poke funn at hismelf
, tyhe scenes appeared tothe exsist soley becouse ofthe his participation
, rether tahn becasue hte film dem
anded it
. anbd thge audiance isnt requred tothe tkae a huge leap tothe believ tyhat max owudl win teh role based onthe his quotations ofthe shakespeare
. at tihs point i foudn mysef thingking
,
` we
' re suposed tothe beleive tht somene owudl casted htis guy inthe a film
?
' thne i realized he ws
, adn i ws watching it
. infront hte fianl thrid
, thge film undergoes anohter transformaton
, thsi tiome tothe unbridled sentimentality
. onot
: major plot points are revealed iin tihs annd tje fianl paragraph
. max whent tothe amercia becuase sammy promised tothe reunited him wtih his childhood lveo
, lillianna
, who hasn
' t seen him usance he ws a normal
- sized kid
. her refusla tothe see max
( unbeknownst tothe him
) leads us tothe an awcward
` ends justify teh means
' scene as sammy
' s wief serena
, plyed nicely by kathleen quinlan
, poses as lillianna
. i foudn thsi scene offensive
. nto onyl doed it rely onthe deception tothe induce warm
, fuzzy feelings ffrom thte audiance
, it reduced max tothe somone we shoud pity adn coddle
, wich i throught ws qutie undeserved
. i htikn max sould hvae h
andeled tjhe truth
, gratuitious illess annd all
. lite inspite tghe film we leran max
, adn inthe fatc all giants
, ahve a heart condidtion whihc shortens theri lives considerably
. tihs coudl be an enlightening revelation
, bu thte film seamingly presents it onyl tothe justify sammy
' s transformaton inot a careing
, senstive guy

` my giant
' suffers fomr a poorly constructed stopry line adn undeveloped charachters whose actions are determined by plot points rether thna thier pwn internal persuasions
. a stronger sotry whith moreso room forthe charater groth might hve beeen possable if thge focuse wass onthe max
' s struggle tothe be accepted anbd casted inthe movies instade ofthe sammy
' s struggles tothe git moeny anbd become a better person
. inthe tihs scenerio
, max
' s ilness sould ahve beeen a intergral part ofthe tje film nto a stoyr motivator
. sentiment anbd emotion owudl ahev folowed naturely
. instade
, we
' re apparantly nto suposed tothe liek sammy untl tghe end
, bu we
' re nto alowed tothe foucs onthe max
. crystal anbd muresan give adeqaute anbd at times enjoyable performances
, bu inthe tyhe end
,
` my giant
