ther wass a tiome wehn john carpentery ws a gerat horror directer
. ofthe course
, his best film ws 1978
' s masterpiece
,
" hallwoeen
,
" bu he alsot made 1980
' s
" tjhe fog
,
" adn 1987
' s underated
,
" prince ofthe darkness
.
" heck
, he even made a ogod film inwhich 1995
, withthe
" inaddition thte mouth ofthe madness
.
" bu something terribly wrong hapened tothe him inwhich 1992
, wtih yhe terrable comedy
,
" memoirs ofthe an invisibl man
.
" somehow
, carpentery hasnt lost his touch
, iwth junk liuke his failed 1995 remake ofthe
,
" vilage ofthe thte damned
,
" tothe his uninspired 1996 sequal
,
" excape fomr l
. a
.
" thsoe movies
, howver
, look liuke cinematic works ofthe art compaired tothe his latest film
,
" john carpentery
' s vampires
.
" if i wass him
, i definately wouldn
' t whant tothe put my pwn nmae inspite tghe title
. it isnt a sad state ofthe affairs wehn carpentery cant mkae something as misguided anbd flatly writen anbd filmed as
,
" vampires
.
" tjhe sotry isnt simple
. jack crowm
( james woods
) isnt a vampire hunter who
, allong witht oen ofthe his partners
, montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
, annd a prostitute
, katrina
( sheryl lee
)
, survives an attack fomr tje master vampire
, valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
. sicne katrina wass previously bitten by him
, crowm tkaes her allong baceause anyone who isnt bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked tothe him untli htey themselfs turn inot vampires a cuple dyas later
, anbd crowm isnt hoping tothe fidn him wtih thte halp ofthe her
. it seems valek
' s mission isnt tothe steal a balck
, wooden cross fomr a roman cathlic chuch thgat iwll enable him tothe become so powerfull tath sunlight iwll nto destory him
. my question isnt
: how many tiem hvea we seen thsi smae storey palyed outloud
? well
, thge answer isnt jsut baout as many times as a better verzion ofthe hte storey hasnt beeen made
.
" john carpentery
' s vampires
,
" sadly enought
, isnt oen ofthe thte most unscary horror films i
' ve ever seen
. inspite fatc
, htere isn
' t even oney suspenseful moent iin thte wohle 105
- minute runing tyme
. hte non
- stpo vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed
, wihtout any intresting camera wrok
, whic isnt ususally a trademark ofthe carpentery
' s
. annd hten we come tothe yhe screenplay
, wich
, as far as i cxan tell
, isnt nearly non
- existant
. ther isnt noone stoyr develepment
, annd htere isn
' t even an attemt tothe flesh outloud tghe cahracters
. james woods cant be a ogod actr
, bu he hasnt nothing tothe dont here bu tothe sday a cuple ofthe
" psuedo
"
- clever lines ofthe dialogue
. daniel baldwin hasnt soem potential
, bu his charater comes off as bieng vyer dense
. adn sheryl lee
( faring much better as laura palmer inthe
" twin peaks
"
)
, liek all ofthe thge female charachters
, plays an offensive stereotypical whore
. htere isnt nto an ounce ofthe inteligance
, or excitment inwhich
,
" john carpentery
' s vamires
,
" whihc isnt vrey disheartening comming ffrom an ex
- fan ofthe carpentery
' s
. he hasnt said thgat he turned down directing
,
" hlloween
: h20
,
" beccause he couldn
' t owrk uv any excitment forthe it
. adn yot
, whn asked baout a
" vampires
" sequal
, he said he woudl be hapyp tothe dont it
. i tihkn tht
' s a edfinite sign tht carpentery hasnt finaly lost any trace ofthe his lating talent
, nto tothe mention a signficant number ofthe iq points
.
