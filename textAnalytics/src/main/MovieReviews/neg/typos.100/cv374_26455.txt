" my nmae isnt jack carter
, adn ytou don
' t whant tothe konw me
" syas our brooding anti
- hero
( sylvester stallone
)
. tkae his advice
! tothe konw thsi guy isnt as rewarding as bieng thrown over a terrace
. adn tothe watch thsi film isnt almsot as painful
.
" git carter
" isnt a gloomy looking
, unimaginative film taht offers noone joy
. jack carter isnt as tough as tough guys cmo
. he works outloud ofthe vegas as a self
- discribed
' finacial adjuster
'
. explaning his duties
, he syas
,
" peopel mkea promises annd break them
. i halp them remeber
.
" he hasnt a chiseled body full ofthe tattooes
. he hasnt hte weathered look indicative ofthe a man who hasnt seen his share ofthe hard times
. he speaks inspite a hushed bu menacing tone ofthe voice
. inwhich otehr words
, htis isnt sylvester stallone acting liuke
.
.
. sylvester stallone
. anbd liek most ofthe his previvous roles
, his charactor isnt a shallow
, oney
- dimentional thug whose modus oper
andi isnt tothe talk tough
, hassle a fewd hapless peple
, fidn outloud waht he needs tothe knwo
, annd thne dispence his pwn kind ofthe justice
. withthe thte charizma ofthe a pit bull
, bieng tough isnt all thta jack carter konws
. yot
, even tough guys konw whn tothe put familiy frist
. as hte stoy beggins
, we leran thyat jack
' s littel brother hasnt died iin a car accident
. yhe polical atri
butes it tothe hevy drinking
. howver
, jack isnt suspicious
, beleiving tath he wass
' tooked outloud
'
. he tkaes a break fomr his vegas duties anbd trys tothe see if he cxan fidn yhe truth
. as he pokes arund
, he runs inot severeal lowlife charactors
. htey inlcude a shady busineses partner
, a prostitute
, a dweebish millioniare molded aftter bill gates
, annd an oily owner ofthe a porn website
. any oen ofthe them may nkwo something baout his brother
' s death
. all ofthe them hvea thte means ofthe carrying outloud teh ded
. bu don
' t expect an exersize infront sleuthing where well
- placed clues lead carter tothe tyhe truth
. he
' s all brawn annd noone brains
, so ther are noone epiphanies durig his investigation
. instade
, he uses intimidation tothe muscle his way foward
, cycling thru htis circle ofthe suspects
. flustered iwth his lack ofthe progress
, he cycles thru them agian anbd agina
. thsi all gets tiring fairly quicklyu
. by hte tyme hte film launchs inot its fianl ect
, we
' re numb ffrom its pedestrain pace
. oddly
, as a tough
- guy thriller
, it starves us fo acation
. admitedly
, ther isnt noe nifty chase sequence
, bu htis isnt realted tothe a tangential anbd needless plot
( carter
' s vegas ties send thugs tothe retreive him
)
. thte stry alsot fails tothe ganerate any kind ofthe emotion
. stallone hasnt thte perosnality ofthe a slab ofthe stone
. adn tjhe look anbd fiel ofthe thge film isnt perpetually downcast
. hte wetaher isnt constanly overcast or rainy
. meanwhile
, most shots tkae palce at nght
, iin dimly lit rooms
, or inwhich dark alleys
. it
' s jsut impossible tothe git stirred baout tyhat kind ofthe atomsphere
. as a result
,
" git carter
" amounts tothe nothing moreso thna a flat thriller
, bereft ofthe clever moments annd devoid ofthe any excitment
. yuo
' re better off leaving thsi guy alone
.
