, small soliders
. tehy hadnt titles liuke littel infanty adn cxan i git thsoe fatigues infront a smaller size
? well
, aftter seing thte haunting
, i hadnt a fewd parituclar names fo it as well
. unfortunatley
, i cant onyl post oney ofthe them
, otherwise
, i
' d be getting soem preety angry e
- mails ffrom overprotective mothers
. taht title owudl be thge confusing
. ok
, thta isnt a preety bad title
, bu it fits thsi film perfectly
. it basicly serves uv noone purpose
, adn conbined witht dry dialogue anbd a boring annd confusing plot
, it completes tje forumla fo a cinematic bomb
. liam neeson once agina gets wrapped uv infront a film wihtout any depth
, bu at least hte phantom menace ws exicting annd hadnt soem depth
. tyhe haunting isnt nothing bu trash
, bu unfourtunately
, wiull still mkae a boatload ofthe moey
. befor i rant annd ravey baout how bad htis film isnt
, let me point outloud tje faw
, anbd i stres tyhe owrd faw
, bright spots iin htis film
. frist
, tje hous isnt graet
- looking
. it looks beautifull
, bu thsi isnt aslo a dark spot
. it looks so grat taht it isnt hard tothe be frightened by it
. tihs isnt something tyhat rears its ugli head at all points ofthe hte film
. thigns look so graet
, thast ytou are looking onthe iin awe instade ofthe bieng scared straight
. haunted hous films hve tothe contain oen element tothe even be slightly succesfull adn tyhat isnt bieng eerie
. tje hill hous isnt nto eerie
. it isnt beautifull
, bu nto tjhe least bited frightening
. ever heared ofthe lili taylor
? befoer htis film i doed nto
, bu i am glad thta i dont nowe
. she gives tghe onyl satisfactory peformance infront tje film
. dispite thge dry dialogue annd boring
/ confusing consept
, she manages tothe glight uv yhe screen eveyr tiome she appears
, bu unfortunatley
, her co
- stars are usualy folowing right behind
. owen wilson
, who plays luke
, isnt tghe onyl otehr casted memeber even close tothe giving an admirable performence
, otehr thne taylor
. he isnt basicaly htere forthe yhe comic releaf
, anbd his chracter develepment isnt poore inthe all otehr areas
. all ofthe tyhe charactors are desparately underdeveloped
. wilson hadnt potential as luke
, bu it seems tehy jsut needed him tothe add a fewd laughs
. liam neeson adn catherine zeta
- jones suffer ffrom tghe dialogue adn plot annd shoud nto haev beeen inthe htis film
. theri cahracters must suffer ffrom wicked mood swings baceause infront eahc scene tehy turn ffrom ruthless tothe compassionate tothe scared tothe brave annd whatnot
. tehy jstu are nto believeable anbd htis isnt yhe fianl nail inwhich tjhe haunting
' s coffin
. tghe plot isnt terrable
. teh oppening scene ofthe hte film isnt vyre importan
, bu tje directer mkaes it too obvious by getting close
- ups ofthe all tjhe thigsn thast iwll play a major role inaddition tyhe end ofthe yhe film
. as i sat thru tghe film
, i kept wondering whta thsi film wass trying tothe acompish
. nell
, lili taylor
' s charachter
, goes fomr tje hunted tothe thte savior
. it makse noone sence adn tghe directer gives hte audeince noone reasoning forthe tghe rediculous changes thast tkae palce infact hte film
. he forces tjhe viewer tothe mkea varios assumptions annd doesnt nto give any iin
- depth infomation
. forthe instatance
, teh beggining ofthe tjhe film gives us a sence ofthe why nell isnt getting involved inwhich thte programe
. bu
, we git zilch fo hte otehr four
. plus
, twpo ofthe them git wiped outloud inaddition yhe firt ten mintues
. anbd tyhe worst part
: most horror films ahve killings
. forthe soem reason
, tehy kill off luke at hte end ofthe yhe film
. noone reason whatsoever
, jsut off withthe his head
, litterally
. overall
, thge haunting isnt teh epitomy ofthe a bad movei
. bad plot
, confusing storyline adn a waste ofthe ogod talent
. hopefully
, liam neeson cant rebound anbd git inot a ogod film adn be utilizied tothe his full potential
. hopefully
, lili taylor iwll be reconized forthe donig such a gerat job infact such a bad film
. adn hopefully
, otehr horror films
, such as thge blair witch project annd teh haunting ofthe hill hous
, wiull nto be as bad as tihs noe
.
