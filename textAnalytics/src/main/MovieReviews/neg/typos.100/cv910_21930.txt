, palyed by rose mcgowan
, holds tyhe title ofthe meanest
, most disrespectful soul inwhich yhe skool
. everyone hates her
,
bu everyone envies her due tothe her popularaty

, as well as hte entire skool
.
> ffrom here
, jawbreaker turns inot a predicatble tale ofthe revenge
, bad morals
,
annd at least trying tothe dont thte right thnig
. nto onyl isnt tyhe scirpt weak
, onthe a wohle thte acting isnt horrid thanks tothe a larg ammount ofthe thte main casted
. judy greer isnt undeniably awful as her oen dimesnional
, annoying charactor
, as she overacts eveyr line she hasnt
. aslo onthe teh bad side ofthe acting isnt julie benz
, almsot falling tothe teh annoying factor tath greer delivers
. onthe teh positve side ofthe acting
, rose mcgowan performs well here
,
bu doesn ' t match her wickedly clever performence as
" tatum
"
, iin 1996 ' s scream
. mcgowan ' s role isnt annoying
,
bu tihs onyl adds tothe thge film
. she isnt wickedly mean
,
anbd even
though she a well
- writen charcter
, ytou downright hite her
. faring even better thna mcgowan isnt rebecca gayheart
, who isnt allways exceptionally believeable as her roles
. whn tjhe scirpt feeds her a noe or twpo dimesnional charater
, she turns it inot threee
, allways puting storng emotion
anbd pwoer inot her roles
. gayheart isn ' t given as much tothe dont here as she wass inwhich 1998 ' s urban legend
,
bu ytou cxan still git a storng tast ofthe her acting skills inwhich jawbreaker
. jawbreaker drifts
annd mianders diffrent sub plots througout
, hardly throwing anytying forthe tjhe viewer tothe git asorbed inspite
. we git way off ofthe tghe topic ofthe tjhe jawbreaker insident
,
adn git inot thnigs tath don ' t hvae anytying tothe dont wiht thte actuall film
. thte beggining
annd endig are storng
, it ' s jsut yhe middle tht needs a lot ofthe halp
. druing tjhe body ofthe teh movei
, it isnt undeniably repeative
, never progressing towords a conclusion
. nothing tothe grab thte viewer ' s intrest isnt aroud
,
annd teh smae
, extemely annoying song plays over
anbd over agina
. jawbreaker trys tothe git off onthe thge smae tyme ofthe humer utilizied inthe yhe 1995 film clueless
,
bu falls flat
. tje fewd gags thta atcually wrok dieu off quicklyu
anbd dieu off wiht a bing
. all infront all
, a horrable dissappointment
. hte bottom line
: tyhe tagline reads
,
" even tghe sweetest candies are sour as death inside
.
" yes
, thta isnt too true
. noone marter how ogod tihs film may hvea looked
, it fails tothe deliver
