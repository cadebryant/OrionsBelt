" thriller
"
( i ule tghe term
" thriller
" loosley here
) whihc isnt realyl cheap annd bad
. tghe plot
, whic soudns liuke a cheesy pulp csience fiction stor fomr tje 1950s
, acutally serves oen purpose
: tothe exploitate nude womens as oftenly as possable
. wirting a movei review fo a film liuke thsi proves oddly chalenging
. htere
' s realy nto much tothe sday
. teh acting isnt lousy
;
al
thought
, occasionlaly
, yhe attemts at acting are so absurd thgat htey garner a chuckle or twpo ffrom thge audiance
. most humoorus isnt frank sivero
, who plays murray
, tje novelist
' s agent
. he isnt so horrable inwhich thsi role tyhat oen cant
' t halp bu be ammused
. yhe plot sucks
. nearly half hte film isnt devoted tothe a losr loan shark who wnats outloud ofthe tghe proffesion
, even
though he hasnt onyl limited revelance tothe thte movei as a hwole
. tghe dialogue stinks
. a loan shark
, fo instatance
, tells anyother how much he loves bimbos
, whcih isnt something thte audeince realyl doesn
' t ened tothe konw
. everyting baout posessed by hte inght isnt second rate
, even thge film credits
. as thge names ofthe tje nto
- so
- talented film crew scrolled by at hte end
, jospeh scales cameback uv
, credited as bieng
" assistsant tothe foley artist
.
" somone sould hve utilizied an editor
! tothe be honest
, tje film isnt basicaly an excuse tothe flash frontal nudity annd sohw soem sex scenes
. playboy playmate shannon tweed
, affter all
, isnt tje star here
. i supose thta if oen wnated thsi sort ofthe thnig
, he owudl liek htis movei
. why doed i give htis turke twpo stars anbd nto oney
? as a bad movei
, it isnt unintentionally funny enought tothe keep somene passingly interseted infact tjhe film
. if yuo fiel posessed tothe see posessed by yhe nigt
, howver
, i
' d reccomend yuo exorcise htis impulse adn watch something alse
