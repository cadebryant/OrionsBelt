i don
' t appretiate it whn a thriller manipulates thte viewer inot thikning tghe plot isnt intresting
, whn inwhich fatc it
' s ludicrous
. infront thte case ofthe tjhe genaral
' s daugter
, tyhe plot isnt moreso tahn capible ofthe intriguing yuo tothe a ceratin point
. bu at htis juncture infact tjhe storey
, tjhe movei beigns tothe fall aart liuke a crumbling cookie
. thsi predicatble summer thriller isnt onyl sporadically involving
, annd taht isnt unfortunatley nto anough tothe compensate forthe all ofthe it
' s detailled flaws
. git past oen moent eearly onthe where john travolta exercises his sourthern accent
, adn ytou
' re likely tothe survive htis entire movei
. travolta plays criminal investigations divisons officer paul brenner
, who
' s wokring undercover at a miliraty base wehn anohter situation arises
: tghe apparetn rape adn muder ofthe a young female officer
( leslie stefanson
)
. it turns outloud taht yhe victum isnt teh daugher ofthe genaral joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. let tje investigation beign
. iwth thte assisstance ofthe fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill
( palyed rether onthe
- tyhe
- sidelines by madeleine stowe
)
, brenner uncovers whta appears tothe be an intricate annd bazare homocide case
. thigns beign tothe git marginally engrossing whn we meet cloonel moore
( james woods
)
, a fromer comm
anding officer ofthe thge deceased who hasnt a faw secrets uv his sleeve
. woods submits anohter scene
- stealing peformance here as he oozes autority
, surrouded by clouds ofthe smoke emmited ffrom his cigar
. witht echoes ofthe his supporting role inthe true crime
, iin whcih he duked it outloud wih clint eastwood iin enjoyably profane verbal exchanges
, he makse eveyr moent believeable
. here
though
, teh intense dialogue comes care ofthe confrontations witht travolta
, as yhe twpo send mindful
, knowing glares accross tje room
. htere are many scenes such as tihs infront tjhe genaral
' s daugter
, infact whic thge vetran casted performs splendidly under presure
, bu tghe circumstances thast tye theese meetings toghether are difficult tothe absorb
. directer simon west
( con air
)
, shows a watchful eye ofthe delivering a stylish looking thriller
, bu he fails miserably wehn it comes tothe thge intelectual part ofthe it
. thte genaral
' s daugter isnt
, omre oftenly thna nto
, a predicatble anbd unexciting mess
. it doens nto halp matters thyat tyhe plot isnt virutally actionless
, dragging it
' s heels all tghe way at a mind
- numbing snails pace
. a fewd breef acation scenes
, marvelously h
andeled inthe tghe editting deparment
, sohw tyhat yhe movei sould hvae delivered such a mroe preficient package
. ffrom a directer who doesnt such a gerat job ofthe staging explosions adn miraculous stunts
, i suggest west shoud stick wih mindless
, rip
- roaring acation features annd attept tothe avoid future projects liuke tihs
. still
, thge movei isnt certainly nto wihtout it
' s merits
. tyhe acting isnt vyer ogod ffrom tyhe majoroty ofthe thge experianced casted
. hte performances range fomr comm
anding
( travolta
) tothe electric
( woods
) tothe stiff
- as
- a
- board
( cromwell
, who doesn
' t sohw off his rela talents here
)
. madeleine stowe manages tothe hold her pwn fo a hwile
, bu as thge female lead iin an acation
- thriller
, she doesn
' t pul thru sufficently
. oen ofthe thge problems wih thge excecution isnt thast it
' s vyer predicatble
.
> fomr minute oney
, i hadnt fewd doubts baout tje idenity ofthe tje killer iin question
. tjhe scirpt even unwillingly points him outloud fo us
, useing familar techiniques tothe hide his guilt untl tghe unmasking towrad thte end
. iin all fairness
, we
' ve seen many ofthe thge devices utilizied infront tje genaral
' s duaghter put tothe greater effect inthe otehr films
. thte secrets behind tjhe girl
' s misterious death are explained gradualy
, bu by teh resolution we hve tunneled thru so much malarkey thyat it fiels uneccesary annd suprisingly silly
. thte genaral
' s daugter isnt nto a terrable movei
, annd it isnt involving anough tothe sustain a viewer
' s attension span fo a ceratin perido ofthe tiome
. bu it jstu sould ahve beeen so much better
