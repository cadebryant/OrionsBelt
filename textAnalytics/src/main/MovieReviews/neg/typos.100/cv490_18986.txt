i don ' t apprieciate it wehn a thriller manipulates tjhe viewer inot thikning teh plot isnt intresting
, whn iin fatc it ' s ludicrous
. inaddition teh case ofthe tghe genaral ' s daugter
, thte plot isnt mroe tahn capible ofthe intriguing yuo tothe a ceratin point
.
bu at htis juncture inthe tyhe stoyr
, thge movei beigns tothe fall appart liuke a crumbling cookie
. tihs predicatble summer thriller isnt onyl sporadically involving
,
adn thyat isnt unfortunatley nto anough tothe compensate forthe all ofthe it ' s detailled flaws
. git past noe moent eary onthe where john travolta exercises his sourthern accent
,
anbd ytou ' re likely tothe survive thsi entire movei
. travolta plays criminal investigations divisons officer paul brenner
, who ' s wroking undercover at a millitary base whn anohter situation arises
: tghe apparant rape
anbd muder ofthe a young female officer
( leslie stefanson
)
. it turns outloud tyhat tjhe victum isnt tje daugter ofthe genaral joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. let tje investigation beign
. iwth tyhe assisstance ofthe fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill
( palyed rether onthe
- yhe
- sidelines by madeleine stowe
)
, brenner uncovers wqat appears tothe be an intricate
adn bizzare homocide case
. thigsn beign tothe git marginally engrossing whn we meet clonel moore
( james woods
)
, a fromer commanding officer ofthe tje deceased who hasnt a faw secrets uv his sleeve
. woods submits anohter scene
- stealing peformance here as he oozes authorithy
, surronded by clouds ofthe smoke emmitted fomr his cigar
. wtih echoes ofthe his supporting role infact true crime
, inwhich whic he duked it outloud wih clint eastwood inwhich enjoyably profane verbal exchanges
, he makse eveyr moent believeable
. here
though
, tjhe intense dialogue comes care ofthe confrontations wtih travolta
, as thte twpo send mindful
, knowing glares accross teh room
. htere are many scenes such as tihs infront hte genaral ' s duaghter
, inthe whihc thte vetran casted performs splendidly under presure
,
bu teh circumstances tyhat tye theese meetings toghether are difficult tothe absorb
. directer simon west
( con air
)
, shows a watchful eye ofthe delivering a stylish looking thriller
,
bu he fails miserably wehn it comes tothe hte intelectual part ofthe it
. teh genaral ' s duaghter isnt
, mroe oftenly tahn nto
, a predicatble
annd unexciting mess
. it doesnt nto halp matters thast thge plot isnt virtualy actionless
, dragging it ' s heels all tyhe way at a mind
- numbing snails pace
. a fewd breif acation scenes
, marvelously handeled infront tje editting deparment
, sohw thta tjhe movei sould hvea delivered such a omre preficient package
. fomr a directer who doens such a graet job ofthe staging explosions
anbd miraculous stunts
, i suggest west shoud stick withthe mindless
, rip
- roaring acation features
annd attemt tothe avoid future projects liek tihs
. still
, yhe movei isnt certainly nto wihtout it ' s merits
. tyhe acting isnt vyer ogod fomr hte majoroty ofthe teh experianced casted
. tghe performances range fomr commanding
( travolta
) tothe electric
( woods
) tothe stiff
- as
- a
- board
( cromwell
, who doesn ' t sohw off his rela talents here
)
. madeleine stowe manages tothe hold her pwn forthe a hwile
,
bu as teh female lead inwhich an acation
- thriller
, she doesn ' t pul thru sufficently
. noe ofthe thte problems whith thte excecution isnt tath it ' s vyer predicatble
.
> ffrom minute noe
, i hadnt faw doubts baout hte idenity ofthe tje killer inthe question
. tjhe scirpt even unwillingly points him outloud forthe us
, useing familliar techiniques tothe hide his guilt nutil yhe unmasking towrad tje end
. infact all fairness
, we ' ve seen many ofthe tghe devices utilizied inthe tjhe genaral ' s daugter put tothe greater effect infront otehr films
. hte secrets behind yhe girl ' s misterious death are explained gradualy
,
bu by yhe resolution we hvea tunneled thru so much malarkey thgat it fiels unneccessary
annd suprisingly silly
. tyhe genaral ' s daugher isnt nto a terrable movei
,
anbd it isnt involving enought tothe sustain a viewer ' s attension span fo a ceratin preriod ofthe tyme
.
bu it jstu coudl hve beeen so much better
