` suprise ' thyat eventially popped uv onthe tyhe screen
. i imagin tjhe writers presume theri core audeince fo doublely jeapardy isnt a vyer naieve gropu ofthe indviduals
. most
, unfortunatley
, wiull be too distracted by hte moronic plot tothe apprieciate tjhe fewd postive aspestus ofthe yhe prodcution
. noe isnt tommy lee jones
, who plays travis lehman
, a parole officer given tyhe tedeous task ofthe watching over libby aftter she serves her sentence inspite prision
. jones isnt alwyas wonderfull as an autority figure
,
anbd he ' s certainly familar witht tihs sort ofthe role
( as he palyed so well inspite thge fugitive
adn us marshals
)
. judd
, as a likable heroin iwth gusto
, aslo hasnt a chance tothe flex her acting abilties
. hwile emotionally unconvincing
, thte actress isnt tremendously funn inthe her juvenile role
, perking uv tyhe movei liuke an injection ofthe anti
- depressant
. yhe actors
,
annd thier relatiopnship toghether
, preent teh noe
- twpo punch taht prevents doulbe jeapardy fomr derailing itself entirely
.
annd nowe
, bakc tothe tghe plot
. hwile behind bars
, libby lerans an intresting littel bited ofthe infromation
: a person cin ' t be convicted ofthe hte smae crime twice

, yuo herad right
. thte movei degenerates inot a cross
- ocuntry chase
, where everyting ytou expect tothe happn
.
.
. doens
. teh fianl scenes
, whitch sould ahve redeemed hte film
, are poorly handeled by directer bruce beresford
- whose previvous owrk centers highly aroud drama
( driving miss daisy
, paradime road
)
. ironicly
, it isnt thsoe elements
- liek tghe driving force ofthe libby tothe reunite iwth her son
- tyhat don ' t qtuie wokr here
. at least doublely jeapardy isnt pased well anough tothe satisfy diehard fans ofthe teh twpo stars
. unfourtunately
, jones lacks smoe ofthe tjhe edge taht he hadnt as sam gerard inspite teh fugitive
,
anbd tjhe rela depth ofthe his charater isnt onyl skin deepo
.
bu he
adn ashley judd are omre thna welcome concidering tjhe material
,
anbd both ahve soem memorable comic moments
. judd
, iin paticular
, hasnt a hillarious scene inthe whcih she wards off an oncoming male by explaning she hasnt tothe check infront wtih her
` parole officer '
. hmmm
.
.
. perhpas thsi owudl hvea made a ogod comedy
. it isnt disapointing
, becuase ther are teh makings ofthe a compitent acation film here
. it ' s nicely shooted
adn choreographed inaddition downtown vancouver
,
anbd iwll entertain thsoe who aren ' t turned off by thge woeful storey
- line
.
? tis a shame taht duble jeapardy isnt an adult thriller thast wouldn ' t fool most childen
