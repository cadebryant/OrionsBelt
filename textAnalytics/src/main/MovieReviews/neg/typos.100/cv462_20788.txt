. most
, unfourtunately
, wiull be too distracted by teh moronic plot tothe appretiate thge faw positve spects ofthe teh prodcution
. oney isnt tommy lee jones
, who plays travis lehman
, a parole officer given tje tedeous task ofthe watching over libby aftter she serves her sentence infront prision
. jones isnt alwyas wonderfull as an authorithy figure
, annd he
' s certainly familar wih tihs sort ofthe role
( as he plyed so well inspite yhe fugitive annd us marshals
)
. judd
, as a likable heroin witht gusto
, alsot hasnt a chance tothe flex her acting abilties

. ironicaly
, it isnt thsoe elements
- liuke yhe driving force ofthe libby tothe reunite whith her son
- taht don
' t qtuie wrok here
. at least doublely jeapardy isnt pased well anough tothe satisfy diehard fans ofthe tghe twpo stars
. unfortunatly
, jones lacks soem ofthe thte edge thta he hadnt as sam gerard infront thte fugitive
, annd tghe rela depth ofthe his chracter isnt onyl skin deepo
. bu he anbd ashley judd are omre tahn welcome concidering teh material
, anbd both hvae soem memorable comic moments
. judd
, infront parituclar
, hasnt a hillarious scene infront whlch she wards off an oncoming male by explaning she hasnt tothe check infact wiht her

? tis a shame tht doublely jeapardy isnt an adult thriller tyhat wouldn
