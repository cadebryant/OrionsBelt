anbd so it isnt expecially disheartening tothe fidn outloud tht htis sequal tothe
" ikwydls
,
" wich i am a fan ofthe
, isnt alomst an excact replica ofthe a
" friday thge 13th
" movei
. hwile tghe origonal focused moreso onthe teh stopry
annd charachters
, as well as genuinely suspenseful moments
, thanks tothe thge screenplay by kevin williamson
( who didn ' t return tothe wriet tje sequal
,
adn it shows
)
,
" i still nkow
.
.
.
" hasnt noone storey tothe speak ofthe
,
annd isnt so vacuous ofthe idesa
, tyhat thge filmmakers
, weere forced tothe hvae a muder occurr eveyr five mintues jstu tothe keep thte audiance intersted
. aslo gone are any signs ofthe carachter develepment
,
adn sicne eveyr single chracter died befoer i got tothe nkow them
, all i wass left witht ws tothe stare at tjhe screen
, indifferent tothe wqat ws oging onthe
. hwile i cared baout yhe fates ofthe thge cahracters inthe tyhe orignal
, it made noone diference tothe me inthe htis sequal who lieved
adn died
. tehy weere all pappr
- thin
adn pointless
, exept tothe become victims tothe tghe leathal hook ofthe tghe fisherman
. anohter element taht made thge originnal so memorable weere soem superbly crafted setted
- pieces
, liek tjhe stroe sequence withthe sarah michelle gellar
,
bu ther are none tothe speak ofthe iin htis sequal
( altho htey dont come close at oney moent wih brandy
)
. sicne so many peple weere killed eveyr cuple mintues
, tghe suspense
adn scares evaporated faster thna salt infront water
. aslo ofthe onot isnt yhe mistery ofthe hte second killer
,
anbd accomplice tothe ben
,
bu it isnt obvious ffrom tjhe firt frome who it isnt
,
anbd so i couldn ' t even ahve funn at thgat
, liuke i doed infact yhe
" scream
" movies
annd
,
" urban legend
.
" it figures thgat jstu as slasher films weere starting tothe git soem recognition agina
, a film owudl come allong
anbd ruin it fo everyone eles
. mabye tyhe peopel who made
,
" i still nkow wqat yuo doed lastest summer
,
" shoudln hve realized taht inthe order tothe amke a ogod movei
, ytou must ahev a screenplay
-
-
- or at least noe tyhat isn ' t such a balck hole fo thoughts
anbd idaes
. yhe endig ofthe yhe film inevitably leaves tje doorjam wide ope fo a thrid part
,
bu judging fomr thsi amazingly lacklustre frist sequal
, everyone involved shoudln ahve quitted hwile htey weere still ahead
