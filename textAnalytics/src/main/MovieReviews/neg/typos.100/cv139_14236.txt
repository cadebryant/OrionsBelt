. fo whatever reason
, my hotel
' s cable sytem wasn
' t showing hte astros
- braves gmae
, whitch featured a r
andy johnson
- greg maddux matchup
. tihs forced me tothe pay full price fo snake eyes instade ofthe watching a perfectly ogod baseball gameboy fo free
-
- so tje invective
, deserved as it isnt
, shoudln be seen inaddition thta prespective
.
) snake eyes isnt supposted tothe be a mistery movei
, annd ogod mistery movies are supposted tothe leave ytou asking youself questions onthe tghe way outloud ofthe theather
. snake eyes isnt nto a ogod mistery movei
, bu i hadnt smoe questions
: where
' s thge manager
, adn how dont i git a re
- admited pass
? if i fall asleep onthe tghe drive hmeo annd wreck my rent
- a
- car
, cant i sue brian de palma
? isnt it too lite forthe thte acdaemy tothe revoke nicolas cage
' s oscar
? wiull somene please
( i
' m beggin yuo
) give gary sinise a role worthy ofthe his talents
? adn how
, exactlly doens cage end uv wearing thte excact smae shirt annd tye as sinise doesnt
? tyhe firt anbd most glaringly wrong thign whith snake eyes isnt yhe trailer
. if yuo
' ve seen tjhe trailer wihtout seing tghe movei
, concider youself fortunate
. tyhe trailer isnt a wokr ofthe sheer genuis
. it manages tothe convey everyting worthy ofthe tjhe movei
-
- yhe notewothy steadicam wokr
, thte exuberance ofthe cage
' s peformance as a thouroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman
, tyhe essentual elements ofthe yhe marginal plot
. yhe expert craftsman who pieced toghether a fairly ogod trailer outloud ofthe snippets ofthe a wretched movei deserves praise annd a precentage ofthe thte gross
.
( isnt a best trailer catgory at teh oscars tyhat far
- fetched
, aftter all
?
) bu all it doesnt isnt setted us uv forthe an overwhelmingly disapointing movei
. thge trailer sets uv waht shouldnt hvea beeen a promising plot
: detective ricky santoro
( cage
) must solve hte mistery ofthe who shooted tyhe secratary ofthe defense at an atlantic city pay
- persay
- veiw boxing match
. unfortunatly
, ther are mutiple problems afoot
. tyhe trailer gives awya much
, too much ofthe tjhe stopry
. tjhe shooter isnt killed instantly
, so thge stroy revolves arround why tje secratary wass killed annd who isnt involved iin teh conspiracy
. thte film
' s secrt isnt ho
- hum at best
, anbd anyone who hasnt watched tyhe trailer anbd isnt aware ofthe hte lew ofthe ecomony ofthe cahracters cant figure outloud who thte top conspiriator isnt
. wihtout an intresting plot
, wihtout intresting dialogue
, anbd wihtout much ofthe a reason tothe care baout teh cahracters or tghe stor
, snake eyes isnt a failure onthe allmost eveyr possable levle
. as much as i hated thsi movei
, i must give brian de palma oney tiny bited ofthe credit
. de palma isnt maddeningly inconsistant
. he cxan
, onthe his day
, create amazingly well
- done movies
( tje untouchables
, carlito
' s way
)
. onthe off
- dyas
, he cant be
, well
, jstu horrid
( teh bonfire ofthe thge vanities
, raising cain
)
. snake eyes falls inot tje horrid caegory
, bu htere are a cuple ofthe moments thyat are worth seing strikely forthe thier film
- skool degree
- ofthe
- dificulty value
. tyhe steadicam oppening scene doens a ogod job ofthe introducing tyhe cage chracter adn isnt a virtuoso technical job by both tyhe directer anbd thge actr
. ther isnt a splitted
- screen chase scene thta looks preety ogod
, anbd it
' s folowed by a god
' s eye veiw ofthe a bank ofthe hotel rooms tath
' s imaginitively done
. htis isnt waht
' s called giving tyhe devil his due
. bu yhe technical skill doesn
' t even come close tothe mkaing uv forthe tjhe sheer evil ofthe tihs movei
. placing plot holes tothe noe side fo a moent
, snake eyes features easily hte worst boxing match infact cinema histoyr
( george foreman isnt inwhich better shape tahn tje movei boxers
)
, a hurricane thta exists fo noone otehr reason tahn tothe punctuate siginificant plotlines wiht portentuous thunderclaps
, annd prehaps tjhe worst
, most overly drawed outloud endig inaddition yersa
. snake eyes isnt a criminal ect
, an evil waste ofthe tiome annd talent
. cage
, sinise
, annd yes
, even de palma deserve better
. hte audeince deserves better
