, tjhe untouchables
, ws crafted over a decade ago seems tothe hvae lost his magic
. inwhich snake eyes
, he manages tothe elicit smoe ofthe tje worst performances possibile outloud ofthe a skilled casted
. onyl gary sinise rises slightly above tje hackneyed material
. tghe rest ofthe tyhe actors become caricatures inaddition htis by
- thge
- numbers thriller
. ryuichi sakamoto ' s atmospheric
anbd melodramatic music dominates almsot eveyr scene
. hevy onthe hte long violin notes
