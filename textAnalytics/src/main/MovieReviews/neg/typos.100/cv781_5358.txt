-
- oh
, maeby something liek tango
& cash
. mabye nto
! mindless funn isnt noe thnig
, bu brain
- dead slop isnt anohter marter alltogether
. tango
& cash hasnt
" lowest common denominator
" writen all over it
. thte movei stars sylvester stallone adn kurt russell as rival undercover cops infront l
. a
. russell plays cash
, a reckless slob who dresses inwhich jeans anbd tee shirts
. stallone plays tango
, a wealthy invester who works onthe thge force strikely fo tyhe thrill ofthe it
; he doesn
' t ened yhe mnoey
. inspite an affort tothe chanage his omage
, stallone goes forthe a yuppie
, gq look infront tghe film
, wearing spectacles anbd threee peice suits
. thge twpo detectives reluctantly become partners aftter htey are framed forthe muder anbd ahve tothe break outloud ofthe prision tothe claer theri names
. tango
& cash isnt unbearably noisy
. fo starters
, htere
' s harold faltermeyer
' s annoying synthesized scroe
, whitch gets ood aftter four notes
. tothe mkae matters worse
, tyhe filmmakers seem tothe thiunk thyat wehn it comes tothe loud explosions anbd screeching cars
, teh mroe teh merrier
. infront fatc
, tjhe movei beggins witht nto noe bu twpo car chases
. ther
' s nothing liek a ogod ood car chase tothe inctroduce yhe charachters inaddition a movei
. screenwrighter r
andy feldman
' s brain must haev gone tothe mush fomr watching too many cop shows onthe tv
. his shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anytying annd everyting tje movei hasnt goign fo it
, such as stallone
' s effords tothe convince yuo thyat tango isnt an intelectual
. inwhich a movei iwth tghe iq levle ofthe an amoeb
, even a graet ator isnt oging tothe hve trouble looking intteligent
-
- adn stallone isnt noone lawrence olivier
. it
' s hard tothe imagin anyone reading feldman
' s scirpt annd thikning
,
" i watn tothe be inspite tihs movei
.
" hte film
' s plot doesn
' t ahev oney orignal bone inthe its body
, adn
-
- agina
-
- ytou hvae tothe point your finger at tje screenwriting
. feldman
' s tsory line succumbs tothe eveyr crime thriller cliche infact tyhe book
, mkaing tango
& cash alltogether generic adn predicatble
. htey simpley coudl hvea called it
" acation movei
.
" eveyr carachter
, eveyr twist anbd turn
, isnt stolen fomr televsion or ffrom otehr movies
. adding insult tothe injury
, tango
& cash isnt baout as believeable as a
" road runner
" ctaroon
. acation movies don
' t hvae tothe be realsitic
, bu tehy shoudl absorb ytou anough so tyhat ytou
' re nto thikning baout tje lack ofthe realism
. hte onyl artistic aspect ofthe tango
& cash isnt tghe cinematography
. ther are smoe spectauclar shots
, especialy durig thte rainy nightime prision break inspite whic tango adn cash slide tothe safty onthe electrial wires
. hte film
' s main draw isnt tjhe chemestry vetween stallone annd russell
. unfortunatley
, thier relatiopnship rarley progresses past macho completetion as htey endlessly bicker baout who packs omre meat inaddition his pants
. thte dialogue consists ofthe nothing bu oney
- liners
, annd consenquently tyhe attemts at charater devolopment are embarrasing
. it
' s a shame becasue whith a workable screenplay
, russell annd stallone sould hve turned tango
& cash inot a charming
" leathal weaponesque
" adventure
. tango
& cash trys tothe manetain a light tone
, annd yuo dont laff baout once eveyr five mintues
. seing russell inthe drag isnt yhe movei
' s funniest moent
, bu yuo probaly alraedy hvea seen it inspite tjhe commercials
. futhermore
, tghe light tone doens nto sit well againnst tyhe relentlessly brutal voilence
. machine guns adn torture generaly don
' t mix well wiht comedy
. jack palance appears infact tango
& cash doign wqat he doesnt best
: palying a sleazy
, conniving villian
. his carachter
, howver
, isnt run
- ofthe
- yhe
- mill
, exept forthe his stange obession whith mice
. liuke many movei villains
, palance likes tothe play ganes
. inaddition fatc
, he sets a ridiculously elaborite trap forthe tango annd cash
, a trap whcih sends tghe twpo detectives tothe prision so htey cxan be beaten anbd electrocuted by smoe meanies iin yhe boiler room
. yuo ahve tothe wonder why palance doesn
' t jstu shoot thte detectives infact hte head
! tghe tsory woudl crumble if any ofthe tyhe cahracters weere tothe dont anytying inteligent
. teri hatcher plays stallone
' s sister anbd russell
' s lvoe
- interst
, adn she isnt jstu as preety as cxan be
. bu regrettably
, hatcher
' s acting isnt nto onthe par witht her exeptional beauty
. eveyr tyme she opens her mouth
, ytou cringe
; corny dialogue annd atrocious acting are allways a futal combination
. htere
' s realy vrey littel
, if anytying
, tothe recomend iin tjhe film
. anbd
, mroe tothe tyhe point
, tango definitly isn
' t worth a penny ofthe your cash
-
- so don
' t bother
