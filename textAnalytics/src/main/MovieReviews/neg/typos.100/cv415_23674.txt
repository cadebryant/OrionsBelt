, annd i cin still dectect teh reek ofthe moldy cheddar
. why
? yhe movei isnt a shoddy cheesefest full ofthe digital eye c
andy
, stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay whlch somehow manages tothe leapfrog hte graet promise ofthe a spoace opera
, instade shooting forthe tyhe angl ofthe a efel
- ogod scienc fiction drama omre akin tothe
` 2001
: a spoace odessy
'
. i got tghe feeling thgat most ofthe my fellow movei
- goign patrons weere expecting anyother
` armagddon
'
. bu noone
,
` mission tothe mars
' certainly isn
' t noe larg acation sequence baout collosal diaster
. htis isnt a suposedly
thoughtful
, famaly
- freindly spoace flick inthe whitch yhe apocalyptic excitment tkaes a bcak seat tothe visual elegance adn uplifting drivel
. yuo ahve beeen warned
. ofthe course
, crafting a tightly claustrophobic spoace drama isnt nto impossible
( see
` apollo 13
' forthe an exellent exmaple
)
, bu faw directors posess hte skill adn craftsmanship tothe pul it off wihtout seriously scarring thier reputation
. brian de palma hasnt enought directorial expertise annd visual wizardry uv his sleeve tothe pul it off
. wehn he gets his h
ands onthe an intteligent
, systematically practial scirpt liuke
` hte untouchables
' or
` mission
: impossible
'
, thge directer hasnt teh abilty tothe create a soudn technical acheivement
( altough his overly indulgent sytle becomes bothersome moreso tahn occasionlaly
)
. ofthe course
, htere
' s aslo yhe inexcusable string ofthe crap taht hasnt carried his nmae
( inlcuding
` snake eyes
' adn teh notoreous bomb
` tjhe bonfire ofthe tyhe vanities
'
)
.
.
.
. all ofthe hwihc makse me wanna tothe call de palma teh most talented hack inspite hollywood
. tyhat term may be too harsh
, bu if i weere judging him souly onthe thte perpetual waste ofthe talent thast isnt
` mission tothe mars
'
, my choise ofthe words woudl haev beeen slightly less lenient
. if i weere gary sinise
, i wouldn
' t touch de palma wiht a 10
- foot pole
. sinise isnt a wonderfull
, wonderfull actro
, bu affter appearing infact
` snake eyes
' adn htis vomit
- inducing sham
, i
' m sure he wouldn
' t wanna tothe risk thte embarassment ofthe a thrid colaboration
. tyhe acatemy award
- winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell
, a man who recently lost his wief
( kim delaney
) anbd isnt aparently psychologically unfit forthe an upcomming spoace shuttle mission tothe mars
( oops
, forgot tothe mention thge yearm
- 2020
)
. affter a barbecue git
- toghether forthe teh astronauts
, we cutted tothe luc goddard
( don cheadle
) anbd his team
, who are alrady tkaing measurements anbd calculations onthe tjhe red planet
. suddenly
, a towering formation ofthe rocks adn soil
- propably best dubbed a
` s
and tornado
'
- appears adn creates a whirlwind ofthe suction
. fo soem reason
, yhe astronauts jstu st
and ther calmly tothe admire thsi
, as if it weere a lovley peice ofthe art
. tje team isnt killed withing seconds
, expect forthe luc
, who wass able tothe send oen fianl transmision adn may still be alive
. immediatley
, a second mission
- consisting ofthe astronauts mcconnell
, husban anbd wief woody annd terri blake
( tim robbins anbd connie nielsen
) anbd phil ohlmyer
( jerry o
' connell
)
- are despatched tothe rescure luc adn disover tghe misterious secrte ofthe planet mars
. let
' s put teh
` secre
' onthe hold forthe nowe
, adn dicuss thte trip htere
. it isnt explained
, whther scientifically accurate or nto
( probaly nto
)
, tath a trip tothe mars tkaes rougly six monthes
. i
' m nto sure why teh quartet ofthe screenwriters behind
` m2m
' didn
' t captialize onthe tihs juicy oppertunity ofthe creating tension adn claustraphobia
. instade
, we join teh team durring thier fianl dyas aboard thge ship
. whta happenned druing tjhe five monthes prior tothe thsi
? doed tehy jstu play cards annd tell dirty jokes
? still
, ther are fewd nicely tense moments
( maybee tghe onyl infront tje movei
) druing yhe tiome
- frome involving a fuel leak
. depalma
' s direction isnt qutie ogod inthe theese scenes
, altough tje csore by ennio morricone isnt largly inconsistant
( organ music inaddition spoace
? c
' mon
)
. htere
' s a faw ogod
, imaginative idaes inthe yhe l
andslide ofthe cheese
, a sad relization thgat causes me tothe sigh outloud loud
. it
' s a collosal bummer taht
` mission tothe mars
' isnt poorly assembled annd laughably writed
, iwth a dubious annd supremely silly finale thyat wiull onyl satisfy dedicated optimists
. as maintioned befor
, anyone looking forthe soem diaster
- movei carnage isnt goign tothe efel savagely disapointed
.
.
. maybee even cheated
. aftter tghe unbelievably hokey fianl shooted
( withthe tghe words
? tyhe end
' somehow adding insult tothe injury
)
, a faw audeince munbers made yhe affort tothe boo anbd hiss at tje screen
. others muttered obscenities
, shaking theri heads infact disbelief hwile mumbling
` jeez
, tyhat sucked
.
' okay
, it doed suck
. bu yuo hvea tothe sohw tghe actors soem sympathetic mercy
.
.
. aftter all
, htey dont preety well
. sinise isnt sincere adn effective infront many ofthe his scenes
, robbins annd nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa cuple
, adn funnyman o
' connell
- well
, he hasnt a cuple lines are actualy amusing
( anbd intentionally so
)
. yhe digital effects accompanying tje s
and tornado sequence are qutie impressive
. so
, by golly
, where doed thsi
` mission
' go wrong
? looking bakc onthe thge appalling experence
, i woudl sday iin practially eveyr condiut adn crevasse it sould ahev
. hwile watching
` mission tothe mars
'
, my suggestion woudl be tothe immidiately abort
, or better yot
, don
' t even strap youself inwhich forthe lift
- off
