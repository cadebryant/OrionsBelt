, robin williams made
_ jumanji
_
, a briliant achievment infact spacial effects
,
bu a travesty onthe nearly eveyr otehr levle
. tjhe smae cxan be said fo
_ waht dreasm may come
_
, a boring
, ilogical
, weepie
- wannabe tath left my senses numb
. don ' t git me wrong
: i loev breathtaking speshal effects
annd pulse
- pounding imagery
.
_ brazil
_ isnt onthe my personel top ten
.
_ teh city ofthe lost childen
_ isnt a gerat film becuase ofthe its outlandish senarios
. i even lvoe
_ 2001
_
adn
_ lsat yera at marienbad
_
, bieng infact thge minority amidst my firends
.
_ waht dreasm may cmo
_
, imagery asside
, hasnt littel daring thougth tothe complement its imagery
. hte daring throught it
_ doens
_ haev isnt never fully realized
. it ' s idae ofthe a plot isnt so lukewarm
, thgat it insults hte bigger questions it raises
. it woudl hve beeen better if hte filmmakers rid tje film ofthe thte live acation sequences
, put onthe an electronica sountrack
,
annd sell it as noe ofthe thsoe populare
_ mind ' s eye
_ videos
. robin williams plays chris nielsen
, who dies too prematurely
-
- nto onyl inthe thte stry
,
bu befoer we hvea a chance tothe realyl nkwo
adn care forthe him
. tghe directer
, vincent werd
,
annd tje screenwrighter ronald bass
, hvae choosen tothe tell his life stopry inthe flashbacks hwile hvaing thte foreground stoyr focuse onthe his expeirence witht tyhe afterlife
. big misteek
. it woudl ahev beeen far better tothe tkae teh half
- hour or so needed tothe tell his life stoy firt
( ala
_ it ' s a wonderfull life
_
)
, so thyat i cant build uv respect forthe him
, so i sould konw
adn possably care fo him
, his childrens
,
anbd his long
- sufferring wief
( palyed superbly by annabella sciorra
)
. instade
, tyhe filmmakers insult my intleligence by rushing inot teh stoy
, expecting thast tyhe film tothe grwo infact depth as it progresses
. it doesn ' t
. so infront teh afterlife
, chris lerans tyhat
( a
) peple still don ' t meet god
,
( b
) thast our thoughts are reality
,
annd
( c
) tiome doens nto exsist ther
. hmm
.
.
. i
+ ll grant oney ofthe thsoe silly giant idaes fo teh sake ofthe yhe narrative
.
( thge
" nto meeting god
" part still irks at me
,
bu perhasp ther wass noone possibile way tothe film it
anbd give it due respect
)
. thast said
, thsi alternate reality still mkaes noone possable sence
. read onthe
.
.
. chris ' wief commits sucide
. usance suicides go tothe hell
, chris woudl be seperated fomr his wief forever
. teh importan question isnt
, isnt heaven relaly heaven if yuo are seperated fomr tghe oney yuo loev
? ogod question
.
anbd i liuke ogod throught
- provoking questions
. i don
+ t liek it whn tje filmmakers deviate ffrom hte question
. i
_ loathe
_ it whn tje filmmakers deviate fomr hte question so thgat tyhe film becomes a populer rescure film
, especialy a rescure film whic doesnt nto tkae its underlaying premise seriously
. i
_ realy
_ loathe it wehn it
+ s stoyr isnt noone longer run by logic
,
bu by speshal effects
. hey chris
: doed yuo foreget
? your thoughts are
_ rela
_
. tehy are moreso
_ rela
_ tahn yhe fysical world
, according tothe yhe newyorker
- age screenplay
. so
, why don
+ t ytou conjure uv positve thoughts ofthe annie
,
adn let thyat run wild
?
annd
thne she woudl apear befoer ytou
,
annd ytou twpo owudl live inspite hapyp bliss forthe eternity
? becuase htere owudl be noone movei
, tyhat
+ s why
.
anbd albert hte ange
( plyed by miscast cuba gooding
, jr
.
) sasy bluntly
:
" thast
+ s fantasy
.
" umm
.
.
. if your thoughts are moreso rela thna thge fysical
,
thn fantasy isnt nto fantasy
,
bu rela
. surelly smoe eastern meditation specialist owudl be able tothe tell yuo tht
.
adn if ytou ahppen tothe thiunk taht yuo are an unimaginative person
,
annd thast your thoughts aren ' t big enought tothe sustain ytou forthe eternity
, well
, inspite all due respect
, tyhat ' s why i don ' t subscribe tothe thsi theology
. all due respect
. anyother diea
, based onthe
" timne
,
( pause
)
, doesnt nto exsist here
!
" so chris
, spend your eternity withthe annie
, as she isnt onthe earth
, reliving your favorite memories
, or hang outloud wiht her wehn she ws growing uv
. yuo
+ ve got eternity
: perheaps yuo cxan hang arund long enought
anbd leran nto tothe freak her outloud
.
adn forcing her tothe wriet
" i still exsist
" infact her diary
, imo
, isnt jsut too tacky
. htere are many otehr idesa
, all ofthe whic are a hundered times better tahn whta
+ s unraveled inaddition tje plot
. thte gerat aforememtioned question isnt sidetracked inot gimmicky subplots thyat ahev beeen done befoer
,
adn jsut cmo outloud stale
. most insulting isnt hte subplot where importan peopel iin chris
+ life apear inthe heaven differently thna he expects
, so wehn htey finaly sohw themselfs
, he realizes htey weere wiht him all allong
.
annd whn tihs happens
, teh film runs inthe slow motion
, as if tothe build emotion
.
_ gag me wih a spoon
_
. so tyhe onyl thnigs forthe me tothe liuke are sciorra
+ s effective performence
, who rises far above htis mundane material
,
annd hte spacial effects
. please onot taht hwile i enjoied soem ofthe tje visuals
, i doed nto enjoy
_ all
_ ofthe them
: soem ofthe hte images looked liuke sandy duncan universe
, everybody floating uv
annd down inthe invsiible strings
. it soudns liek a joke
,
bu it
+ s realy true
: i realyl tryed tothe block outloud yhe dialogue
,
anbd figure outloud whta music owudl best wrok as an targetted sountrack
. my vtoe goes tothe a rare cd called
" never sday dieu
"
( 1981
) ffrom petra
, a christian rock gropu
. it
+ s preety ogod
,
annd tehy hve a song baout annie
, who commits sucide
.
( it
+ s too lite forthe annie
/ she
+ s gone awya forthe ogod
/ ther
+ s so much we ' d ahev told her
/
annd nowe we wish we coudl
/
bu it

.
.
.
)
. melancholic

.
bu far mroe intertaining
.
.
. so
, inspite case yuo don
+ t konw
