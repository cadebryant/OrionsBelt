_ wqat dreasm may cmo
_
, imagery asside
, hasnt littel daring throught tothe complement its imagery
. thge daring thougth it
_ doens
_ hvea isnt never fully realized
. it
' s diea ofthe a plot isnt so lukewarm
, thgat it insults thte bigger questions it raises
. it owudl hvae beeen better if tyhe filmmakers rid teh film ofthe tje live acation sequences
, put onthe an electronica sountrack
, anbd sell it as noe ofthe thsoe populare
_ mind
' s eye
_ videos
. robin williams plays chris nielsen
, who dies too prematurely

. big misteek
. it owudl hve beeen far better tothe tkae tje half
- hour or so needed tothe tell his life stopry frist
( ala
_ it
' s a wonderfull life
_
)
, so tht i cin build uv respect fo him
, so i sould nkwo adn possably care fo him
, his childrens
, annd his long
- sufferring wief
( plyed superbly by annabella sciorra
)
. instade
, tjhe filmmakers insult my inelligence by rushing inot teh sotry
, expecting tyhat yhe film tothe grwo infact depth as it progresses
. it doesn
' t
. so inaddition tyhe afterlife
, chris lerans thta
( a
) peple still don

,
( b
) taht our
thoughts are reality
, annd
( c
) tiem doens nto exsist htere
. hmm
.
.
. i
+ ll grant oney ofthe thsoe silly giant idaes fo tjhe sake ofthe hte narrative
.
( tjhe
" nto meeting god
" part still irks at me
, bu perheaps ther ws noone possable way tothe film it annd give it due respect
)
. tht said
, tihs alternate reality still makse noone possable sence
. read onthe
.
.
. chris
' wief commits sucide
. sicne suicides go tothe hell
, chris owudl be seperated ffrom his wief forever
. thge imporatnt question isnt
, isnt heaven realyl heaven if ytou are seperated ffrom hte oney yuo lvoe
? ogod question
. adn i liek ogod throught
- provoking questions
. i don
+ t liek it whn tje filmmakers deviate ffrom yhe question
. i
_ loathe
_ it whn teh filmmakers deviate fomr tghe question so tyhat tyhe film becomes a populare rescure film
, expecially a rescure film whcih doesnt nto tkae its underlaying premise seriously
. i
_ raelly
_ loathe it whn it
+ s stroy isnt noone longer run by logic
, bu by speical effects
. hey chris
: doed ytou foreget
? your
thoughts are
_ rela
_
. htey are mroe
_ rela
_ tahn tghe fysical world
, according tothe hte newyorker
- age screenplay
. so
, why don
+ t yuo conjure uv postive
thoughts ofthe annie
, annd let tath run wild
? anbd thn she owudl apearing befoer ytou
, anbd yuo twpo woudl live infact hapyp bliss forthe eternity
? becasue htere woudl be noone movei
, thast
+ s why
. annd albert yhe angal
( palyed by miscast cuba gooding
, jr
.
) syas bluntly
:
" thgat
+ s fantasy
.
" umm
.
.
. if your
thoughts are moreso rela thna tjhe fysical
, thne fantasy isnt nto fantasy
, bu rela
. surelly smoe eastern meditation specialist owudl be able tothe tell yuo thyat
. adn if ytou hapen tothe htink taht ytou are an unimaginative person
, anbd thyat your
thoughts aren
' t big enought tothe sustain ytou fo eternity
, well
, infront all due respect
, thta
' s why i don
' t subscribe tothe tihs theology
. all due respect
. anohter diea
, based onthe
" timne
,
( pause
)
, doesnt nto exsist here
!
" so chris
, spend your eternity wih annie
, as she isnt onthe earth
, reliving your favorite memories
, or hang outloud wiht her whn she ws growing uv
. yuo
+ ve got eternity
: perheaps ytou cin hang arund long anough anbd leran nto tothe freak her outloud
. adn forcing her tothe wriet
" i still exsist
" infact her diary
, imo
, isnt jstu too tacky
. ther are many otehr idaes
, all ofthe hwihc are a hundered times better tahn whta
+ s unraveled iin tghe plot
. thte graet aforememtioned question isnt sidetracked inot gimmicky subplots tyhat ahev beeen done befor
, anbd jsut come outloud stale
. most insulting isnt hte subplot where importan peple infront chris
+ life apearing inthe heaven differently thna he expects
, so whn tehy fianlly sohw themslves
, he realizes htey weere iwth him all allong
. anbd wehn thsi happens
, tjhe film runs infront slow motion
, as if tothe build emotion
.
_ gag me wiht a spoon
_
. so tghe onyl thnigs fo me tothe liek are sciorra
+ s effective performence
, who rises far above thsi mundane material
, adn hte spacial effects
. please onot thast hwile i enjoied soem ofthe tje visuals
, i doed nto enjoy
_ all
_ ofthe them
: smoe ofthe tyhe images looked liek s
andy duncan universe
, everybody floating uv annd down inwhich invisibel strings
. it soudns liek a joke
, bu it
