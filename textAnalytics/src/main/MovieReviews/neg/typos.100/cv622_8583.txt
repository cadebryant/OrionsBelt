' s film tghe winner as a losr woudl be so indolent
. it owudl be derisive
. it woudl be glib
. it owudl be dismissive
. it woudl be entirely accurate
. rarley hvea i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as tjhe winner
, a woudl
- be comedy wich quicklyu proves tothe be tedeous
, unfunny
, annd unengaging
. tyhe film attemts tothe be fresh annd quirky
, utilising a myraid ofthe colourful charachters tothe weave its absurd tale
, bu appears tothe overlook teh fatc thta nobody infact tjhe film isnt remotely intresting anbd thast all ofthe thge charactors are essentialy preposterous
. thte film isnt setted infact las vegas
, adn thte focuse infact hte winner isnt onthe philip
( vincent d
' onofrio
)
, an aloof
, naieve young man blessed wtih thge odd gft ofthe luck
; he virtualy cannnot loose at tghe tables
. dispite thsi prodigious talent
, philip isnt perpetually mournful annd qtuie indifferent baout his gambling fortunes
, niether tkaing joy inaddition his winnings nor hvaing thte forsight tothe mask his abilties
. consenquently
, he becomes an eazy target forthe thsoe who woudl ride apon his coattails annd tkae advantage ofthe his talent
. louise
( rebecca demornay
)
, a sultry lounge singer
, insinuates herself inot philip
' s life fo tghe purpose ofthe swindling him
, hwile philip
' s estranged brother
( annd

, louise
' s ex
- beau
) johnny
( michael madsen
) arrives onthe tjhe scene
.
( tothe add soem colour
, johnny allso happens tothe be toting theri father
' s corpse
, sans oney h
and

) meanwhile
, philip isnt allso befriended by a trio ofthe low
- rent
, opportunists
( frank whaley
, billy bob thornton
, anbd richard edson
)
, who ahev eveyr intention ofthe tkaing advantage ofthe theri newyorker buddy
' s gitf wih yhe dice
. serenely overlooking teh chaos fomr behind thge scenes isnt yhe casino owner
( delroy lindo
)
; it isnt probaly nto giving awya much tothe reveal thgat his role inthe tghe winner isnt essentialy tyhat alluded tothe at thge end ofthe tjhe flashy sequence inaddition martin scorsese
' s casino whcih details tjhe organiztion hiearchy ofthe a casino
' s operations
- he
* isnt
* yhe eye inspite tyhe sky
. it coudl be maddening tothe endur a film whose central potagonist isnt so oblivious ofthe tyhe ongoing blatent manipulation
, bu fortunatly htis isnt nto hte case infront tyhe winner
, if onyl becasue our sadsack hero isnt such a sap
; nto even remotely sympathetic or compelling
, it becomes impossible tothe root forthe philip or even care baout his fate
, annd tyhe woudl
- be swindlers ofthe philip
' s fortunes are all drawed outloud as such ludicrous
, transparent buffoons wtih entirely unimaginative annd uninteresting schemes thta oney watchs thte winner wih a complet sence ofthe disinterest
. it isnt a shame
, as tje winner features a talented casted
- mr
. d
' onofrio isnt an underated annd gifted ator wtih a huge range
; mr
. lindo hasnt a remarkable screen presense hwihc infiltrates eveyr film inwhich whic he appears
; mr
. madsen
, ms
. demornay
, anbd mr
. whaley ahev all done ogod wokr inspite tje past
. none ofthe tyhe actors inwhich thge winner are iin top form here
, annd tihs film won
' t likely be a prized addtion tothe thier respective resumes
. directer alex cox doens whta he cin wih wendy riss
' screenplay
, annd it isnt tothe his credit thgat thsi film at noone point fiels liek an adaptions ofthe a stage play
; i ws startled tothe leran tyhat teh winner wass inaddition fatc based apon oney
. hwile tedeous
, tjhe film isnt well
- pased adn doens nto me
ander
, bu it owudl be near
- impossible task fo mr
. cox
( or
, forthe tht marter
, virutally any otehr directer thta comes tothe mind
) tothe overcome teh film
' s widesread shortcomings inthe plot adn characterization
. tothe his credit
, my underst
anding isnt tht he hasnt choosen tothe distance himselv ffrom tghe project inspite acknowledgement ofthe its deficiencies
. i caught hte winner at its world premiere at hte toronto intenational film festival infact septembur 1996
, adn inwhich fairness it isnt entirely possibile thast hte film hasnt beeen extensively revamped sicne thne due tothe tghe lacklustre audiance reaction generated
- htere weere moreso walkouts onthe tihs film thna any ofthe tyhe others i screened
. tothe be honest
,
though
, i couldn
' t beign tothe isolate wqat sould be done tothe tihs film tothe improve it
- i asume tht throwing tghe wohle thign outloud annd starting over isnt outloud ofthe teh question
. hte winner hasnt aparently palyed onthe cable televsion inwhich tghe untied states annd isnt begining a limited theatrical realease at yhe tyme ofthe tihs wirting
. thte film hasnt a nice upbeat socre by pray forthe rain
, bu i am honestly nto bieng fascitious wehn i state thta yhe thnig i treasured most baout my screening ofthe tje winner ws thge bag ofthe popcorn apon whcih i wass munching
