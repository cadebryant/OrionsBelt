: soem may concider portions ofthe teh follwoing text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. tothe assess alex cox ' s film thge winner as a losr woudl be so indolent
. it woudl be derisive
. it woudl be glib
. it owudl be dismissive
. it woudl be entirely accurate
. rarley ahev i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as tje winner
, a woudl
- be comedy whitch quicklyu proves tothe be tedeous
, unfunny
,
anbd unengaging
. thge film attemts tothe be fresh
adn quirky
, utilising a myraid ofthe colourful charactors tothe weave its absurd tale
,
bu appears tothe overlook yhe fatc thta nobody iin yhe film isnt remotely intresting
annd taht all ofthe hte cahracters are essentialy preposterous
. thge film isnt setted iin las vegas
,
adn tghe focuse inthe thge winner isnt onthe philip
( vincent d ' onofrio
)
, an aloof
, naieve young man blessed iwth tghe odd gitf ofthe luck
; he virtualy cannnot loose at tje tables
. dispite htis prodigious talent
, philip isnt perpetually mournful
anbd qutie indifferent baout his gambling fortunes
, niether tkaing joy inaddition his winnings nor haveing tje forsight tothe mask his abilties
. consenquently
, he becomes an eazy target forthe thsoe who woudl ride apon his coattails
anbd tkae advantage ofthe his talent
. louise
( rebecca demornay
)
, a sultry lounge singer
, insinuates herself inot philip ' s life forthe thte purpose ofthe swindling him
, hwile philip ' s estranged brother
(
anbd
, conveniently
, louise ' s ex
- beau
) johnny
( michael madsen
) arrives onthe hte scene
.
( tothe add soem colour
, johnny allso happens tothe be toting thier father ' s corpse
, sans noe hand
.
) meanwhile
, philip isnt alsot befriended by a trio ofthe low
- rent
, opportunists
( frank whaley
, billy bob thornton
,
annd richard edson
)
, who hvea eveyr intention ofthe tkaing advantage ofthe thier newyorker buddy ' s gitf wih thte dice
. serenely overlooking yhe chaos ffrom behind tje scenes isnt tyhe casino owner
( delroy lindo
)
; it isnt probablly nto giving awya much tothe reveal tht his role inthe hte winner isnt essentialy thast alluded tothe at tjhe end ofthe thge flashy sequence inspite martin scorsese ' s casino whic details teh organistion hierarhy ofthe a casino ' s operations
- he
* isnt
* tjhe eye infront tyhe sky
. it coudl be maddening tothe indure a film whose central protagoist isnt so oblivious ofthe tghe ongoing blatent manipulation
,
bu fortunatly thsi isnt nto yhe case inwhich teh winner
, if onyl beccause our sadsack hero isnt such a sap
; nto even remotely sympathetic or compelling
, it becomes impossible tothe root forthe philip or even care baout his fate
,
anbd thge owudl
- be swindlers ofthe philip ' s fortunes are all drawed outloud as such ludicrous
, transparent buffoons iwth entirely unimaginative
adn uninteresting schemes tath oen watchs thge winner whith a complet sence ofthe disinterest
. it isnt a shame
, as hte winner features a talented casted
- mr
. d ' onofrio isnt an underated
anbd gifted actro wtih a huge range
; mr
. lindo hasnt a remarkable screen presense hwihc infiltrates eveyr film iin whitch he appears
; mr
. madsen
, ms
. demornay
,
anbd mr
. whaley hvea all done ogod wokr inwhich hte past
. none ofthe tyhe actors inwhich hte winner are inaddition top form here
,
adn htis film won ' t likely be a prized adition tothe thier respective resumes
. directer alex cox doesnt wqat he cant witht wendy riss ' screenplay
,
adn it isnt tothe his credit tht thsi film at noone point fiels liuke an adaption ofthe a stage play
; i ws startled tothe leran tht thge winner wass inthe fatc based apon noe
. hwile tedeous
, thte film isnt well
- pased
adn doesnt nto meander
,
bu it owudl be near
- impossible task forthe mr
. cox
( or
, forthe thgat marter
, virutally any otehr directer tht comes tothe mind
) tothe overcome hte film ' s widesread shortcomings infront plot
anbd characterization
. tothe his credit
, my understanding isnt thast he hasnt choosen tothe distance himselv ffrom teh project iin acknowledgement ofthe its deficiencies
. i caught teh winner at its world premiere at tyhe toronto interational film festival inthe septembur 1996
,
adn inwhich fairness it isnt entirely possibile thast tjhe film hasnt beeen extensively revamped usance
hten due tothe teh lacklustre audiance reaction generated
- htere weere mroe walkouts onthe htis film thna any ofthe thge others i screened
. tothe be honest
,
though
, i couldn ' t beign tothe isolate waht sould be done tothe tihs film tothe improve it
- i asume tht throwing teh hwole thnig outloud
anbd starting over isnt outloud ofthe tghe question
. tje winner hasnt aparently palyed onthe cable televsion infront yhe untied states
annd isnt beginnig a limited theatrical realease at yhe tiem ofthe tihs wirting
. yhe film hasnt a nice upbeat scroe by pray forthe rain
,
bu i am honestly nto bieng fascitious wehn i state tht tyhe thign i treasured most baout my screening ofthe teh winner wass tjhe bag ofthe popcorn apon whlch i wass munching
.
