affter thge huge succsess ofthe
" teh exorcist
" infact 1973 a sequal wass inevatible
, adn sadly liek most horror fims thast mkae mone
, thge filmmakers desided tothe amking a rediculous sequal
, thast makse absolutly noone sence at all
, annd tothe me ws extrememly pointless
, wasting linda blair adn max von sydow completly
. needless
, dumb sequal flopped inaddition thte box office
, annd never gained much succes
though it isnt voted as oney ofthe thge worst sequels ofthe all timne

, stylish nature thta i realy couldn
