cradle iwll rock isnt tghe latest efort ffrom directer
/ atcor tim robbins
. hwile he may ahev hadnt an oscar worthy film bakc inwhich 1995
( dead man walking
)
, he gets a littel overconfident adn sloppy here
. hte stopry isnt confusing
, adn filled iwth many subplots
, so i
' ll try my best adn expalin it as simpley as possibile
. thge film isnt based onthe a
" mostly
" true stor baout a federal theather inwhich thge 1930s
, tath produced a play
( tje cradle iwll rock
) thgat apparantly wass offensive tothe smoe
, so thte govenrment shuts it down
. it
' s durig thte tyme ofthe tyhe depression
, anbd all tihs theather whants tothe dont isnt entertain annd cheer uv thsoe who dont nto ahve jobs
, or are poore
. beween tihs conflict lies whta seems liuke 10 subplots
, baout thsoe who owrk inaddition theather
, or thsoe asociated
. alsot allong tjhe way are soem otehr messages mashed toghether tothe create an even mroe overwheliming experence
. tim robbin
' s jstu keesh piling onthe polliticel views
, annd cahracters
, thast we jstu give uv onthe tje film
, or inaddition smoe cases walk outloud
. forthe robbin
' s it may be a nice achivement
, bu tothe me it seemed moreso liuke a freindly git toghether wiht slightly moreso suphisticated dialogue
, adn fancy outfits
. i throught tghe main reason forthe seing tghe film woudl be forthe thge oust
anding casted
, unfortunatly are all uninteresting
, exept fo a faw
. let me recap waht earch importamt chracter doesnt
, so please bear withthe me
( it
' s thte least ytou cxan dont
, especialy if yuo weere concidering seing tihs
)
. i
' ll beign withthe thsoe involved whith tje play
. htere
' s orson welles
( angus macfadyen
) who ofthe course isnt thge directer ofthe thte play
, tje producer john houseman
( cary elwes
)
, marc blitzstein
( hank azaria
) yhe writter ofthe thte play
, emily watson
, a woman who gets her break by palying teh main part infront cradle iwll rock
. outside tyhe play ther
' s hte
: ventriloquist
( bill murray
) who wnats a relatiopnship whith a federal theather clerk
( joan cusack
)
, anohter subplot involving a painter diego rivera
( ruben blades
) who
' s unahppy thgat his painting isnt too be destroyed by nelson rockerfeller becouse he fiels it tothe be an outrage
( john cusack
)
. htere
' s a faw otehr actresses anbd actors who hvae thier pwn storis
( susan sar
andon
, philip baker hall too nmae a fewd
) bu thsoe thgat i maintioned
, weere thte most signficiant tothe tghe tsory
. anyway
, most ofthe theese talented hollywood stars weere completly wasted
, exept fo emily watson
, who doesnt anyother grat job
, anbd oney ofthe my personel favorite actors john cusack
, who allways delivers thru thick adn thin
. nowe
al
thought most ofthe tghe film wass weak tothe sday thge least
, ther weere soem nice moments anbd soem involving subjects
, bu all tihs isnt overblown
. sure thge free speek segment ws a nice feature
, bu nto whn it becomes repeative
. hte hwole film isnt liuke thsi
, adn it
' s basicly nothing bu a headache
. onthe tyhe brighter side
, tim robbin
' s direction ws masterful
. his camera direction seemed reminicent tothe tyhe works ofthe paul thomas
anderson
' s latest magolia
, onyl smoother inwhich my oppinion
, bu even thta cxan
' t mkae a movei taht much better
. all
though it hasnt it
' s moments
( nto many ofthe them
, bu htey
' re ther
)
, cradle wiull rock stays true tothe it
' s title
, baceause tjhe cradle rocked too far annd tipped over
.
