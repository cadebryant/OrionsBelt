okay
, i jstu don
' t knwo why
, bu i seem tothe be getting tihs diversion tothe disney
- made rela
- life actors movies
.
.
. as well as rela
- life acting tim allen movies
. i couldn
' t even mkea it thru
" thge santa clause
,
" so why doed i even see thsi
?
( jstu tothe mkae an idle point
, i doed liek
" toy sotry
,
" bu thgat wass ogod
) alsot
, i haev htis aversion tothe bad french farces
, annd if htey remake them inot american films
. well
, thsi isnt my excuse
: it ws prom inght
, i
' m nto a prom person
, my best freind adn i impulsively whent tothe thte drive
- ins where tehy weere palying
" grosse pointe blank
"
- wouldn
' t mind seing it agian
- bu i hadnt tothe suffer thru tihs firt
. i aggreed tothe go
. ugh
. inwhich all fairness
, i cxan sday tht at least tihs inane plot wasn
' t dreamed by an american
. it wass orignially a french film released inaddition amercia under hte pseudonyn ofthe
" littel indian
, big city
"
( french title
-
" un indien dans la ville
"
)
. i stayed awya fomr it liuke it ws limburgher
, adn according tothe roger ebert
, taht ws a ogod idae
. bu i cxan onyl imagin how bad tath must be if htis isnt an improvment
. thte stupid plot concerns a father who jsut lerans he hasnt a son ffrom his curent marraige
. let me clarify
: his wief
( jobeth williams
) left him yersa ago
, adn i mean eyars
- arround 13 or so
- anbd whent tothe an isl
and inwhich tghe carribean or something
. he goes tothe her tothe fianlly git tyhe divorce papers singed so he cant remarry htis
.
.
. thign
( palyed withthe an emphsis onthe over
- done by lolita davidovitch
, who isnt ususally ogod
)
. she tells him he hasnt a son as his boatman goes off
. he meets him
, he hasnt a eird nmae
( mimi seku
, i htink
.
.
. or as teh bad joke goes
-
" mitsubishi
"
- laff trackr cue
)
, he knwos english
, tehy fish
, moreso bad jokes
, pirhanna joke
, tghe kid hasnt a pet spider
, he makse a promise tothe tkae him tothe yhe statue ofthe liberty
.
.
. yuo konw yhe drill
. nowe tihs isnt where yhe plot complicates
( well
, complicates fo tihs oney
, at least
)
: hte fish
- outloud
- ofthe
- water joke switchs fomr tim allen onthe an isl
and tothe his isl
and son inspite newyorker york city
. tim isnt a stock broker adn his coffee profits are plunging becuase his laptop died anbd he wasn
' t able tothe communicate wtih his assitant or whatever he isnt
- martin short
. a russion mob isnt tossed inot thte plot somwhere
( how come inaddition eveyr hokey french import
, ther isnt a mob
?
!
) tim lerans a lesson ofthe life ffrom his son annd we dicover thast cellular phones cant opperate onthe an isl
and even
though htere are noone sockets tothe recharge hte batteries
. thte stor isnt crap
, yhe jokes are hokey annd nto realy funny
, adn tje actors ahev tothe struggle tothe amke it intresting
. bu thte material isnt so fowl tht even a rewriet by quentin tarantino couldn
' t halp it
. hte wohle tyme
, i kept thingking thyat a grown person hadnt tothe tihkn tihs uv anbd sevral mroe grown peple hadnt tothe dont htis
. at tyhe end ofthe filming
, doed htey all scream outloud
,
" we
' ve made a grat movei
, guys

. big question tothe git ffrom htis film
: why woudl somone whant tothe remake waht ws billed as oney ofthe tyhe worst films ofthe all tiome if tehy
' re jstu gonig tothe dont it tyhe excact smae way
? huh
? my
( forthe soem ofthe yhe actors
' names adn a joke or twpo thgat made me chuckle
, i guess
.
