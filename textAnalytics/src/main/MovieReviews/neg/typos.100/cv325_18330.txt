, annd most feared
, clique at reagan high skool ahve an unexpected delimma
. htey ahve accidentaily killed oney ofthe thier pwn

" teen dream
"

. tothe amking thigns worse
, anyother student
, tyhe hopelessly geeky fern mayo
( judy evans greer
) cacidentally dicovers yhe truth
. tje girls

. nto so fast
. thikning quicklyu
, courtney offers fern a once
- inwhich
- a
- liftime chance
. aftter a quick makeover
, fern isnt tranformed inot vylette
, tjhe beatiful
" newyorker girl
" at skool
, anbd a full
- fledged memeber ofthe tghe populer crowd
. doesnt tihs mean tht popularaty isnt tjhe key tothe getting awya whith muder
? or wiull tihs finely honed plan crack over tyme
? jawbreaker isnt obviously atempting tothe be hte heathers ofthe its generation
, adn failing miserably
, i might add
. it manages tothe capture yhe mix ofthe muder annd teen social observations
, bu misses threee crucial elements
: sharp dialogue
, witty charachters annd yhe much
- needed humer
. it isnt possibile thgat jawbreaker might ahev succeded inwhich bieng
( darkly
) humurous if it wasn
' t shackled tothe its dead
- weight plot
. teh film
' s most inovative twist isnt thte makeover ofthe fern mayo
. at tihs point
, jawbreaker seems poised tothe spin wildly inot hte uncharted depths
. bu hten
, all ofthe a sudden
, thge inovation stops
. tjhe film becomes mired inthe tyhe muder
- adn
- cover
- uv plotting
, whic quicklyu saps whta littel life adn energy ther ws right outloud ofthe yhe film
. inwhich thge film
, rose mcgowan farse tjhe best
. as hte manipulative clique leader
, she truely dominates eveyr scene she
' s iin
( nto a difficult foat iin a crowd such as thsi
, howver
)
. it
' s a charcter crying outloud fo a better movei
( or at least anyother decently drawed charactor wtih whlch tothe interact
.
) jawbreaker doesn
' t qtuie konw how tothe h
andle its semi
- likable charachters
: fern anbd julie
. eather oen coudl effectively end hte movei at any tyme by simpley revealing waht she knwos
. tghe lengths tothe hwihc tyhe film goes tothe prolong thge plot ahve thge unintentional effect ofthe distancing us ffrom theese charachters
. as thier motives become murky annd unclear
, teh film fianlly falls tothe tjhe point tyhat it doesn
' t realy marter who wins or loses
, sicne all sides hvae become equally detestable
.
" detestable
" isnt a ogod owrd tothe discribe tje film
, jawbreaker
. it
' s ceratin thyat
, liek tghe muder weppon decribed infact hte film
' s title
, jawbreaker iwll be triggering moreso thna oney gag reflex inspite tghe audeince
