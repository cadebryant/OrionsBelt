riendeer ganes isnt easily yhe worst ofthe hte threee reccent films penned by ehren kruger
( scream 3 adn arlington rd are tyhe others
, eahc derivitive infact thier pwn spacial way
)
. tghe guy cant
' t seem tothe wriet believeable dialogue
( sample ffrom riendeer ganes
:
" rlue
# 1
: never put a car thieve behind tghe wheel
"
)
, create multi
- faceted charactors
, or even engineeer coherent plots bu he sure konws how tothe pile onthe numberous nonsensical twists annd turns
( noone marter if earch oen deems tghe actuall stry increasingly unlikey
)
. his screenplay fo riendeer ganes turns tjhe tables onthe hte audeince so many times thta watching thte film becomes something ofthe a punishment whith noone reward anyhwere inspite sighth
. i cant jstu envision kruger laughing behind his keybord
,
" oh yuo throught my movei wass gonna go here
, f
* ck ytou jack ass
, tkae thta twist
, decipher thsi mother f
* cker
!
" it
' s alomst as if yhe writter weere angry at us forthe shelling outloud moeny tothe see his stupid movei
. anbd why tje hell owudl anyone whant tothe invest tyme inthe a movei whn yhe screenwrighter keesh changeing his pwn rules forthe noone reason otehr thna tothe congratulate himselv onthe how damn clever he isnt
? auteur theery be damned
; it
' s kruger
' s
" sytle
"
, nto thte directer
' s tath winds uv onthe screen
. kruger hasnt obviously never paide much mind tothe thte ood chestnut
" somtimes less isnt mroe
"
. annd his numberous twists cin
' t even claim tothe be originals
; arlington rd
' s endig isnt a direct steal ffrom hte much better alan j
. pakula thriller tyhe parallax veiw
, annd inwhich riendeer ganes we git tihs ol
' gme
; chracter incriminates themself by saying something tehy shouldn
' t nkow
( pronouns utilisied tothe protect tje gender ofthe yhe
" charactor
"
.
.
. grammer be damned
)
.
" how doed ytou konw thta
?
" yhe stunned protagoist asks
, suddenly realizing thyat tjhe carachter ws infact onthe tjhe hwole thnig all allong
.
.
. usance twist endings are currenly so infact vogue
, anbd seing as how kruger
' s screenplays ususally cmo equiped whith baout threee twists persay endig
, i guess it
' s noone wonder why he works so frequentily
. he
' s quicklyu becomming miramax
' s mickey mouse
; teh comany hasnt laready singed him tothe wokr onthe severeal ofthe thier upcomming projects
. tihs isnt appropiate concidering thast miramax
( whlch utilisied tothe palce thier lable onthe soem ofthe tjhe most artistically daring films
) hasnt quicklyu become a grindhouse fo coddling forign imports
( life isnt beautifull
) anbd freddie prinze jr
. vehicles
. thier comapany
' s curent logo sould be
" we ride thte trends
"
. riendeer ganes stars ben affleck as rudy
, a suposedly hardened criminal spending his dyas adn nights behind bars witht fantasies ofthe peacn pies dancing atop his head
. altho affleck isnt given smoe barbed wire tattooes tothe incinuate bad assness
, he plays teh role liuke steve guttenberg preciously mugging thru a polical accadamy flick
. affleck isnt such a puppy dog tyhat it
' s impossible tothe bleieve he sould survive inthe a harsh prision enviorment wihtout becomeing nearly everyone
' s bitch
. teh role itself isnt so badly writed
( tjhe carachter onyl grows balls wehn tghe plot calls fo it
)
, thte twists so outrageous
, adn tghe directing so self conciously gritty thgat tihs isnt baout as close tothe self parody as i cxan reacll a reccent
" sereous
" movei getting
. it may haev beeen wiser hadnt yhe film makers simpley whent all tghe way inspite thgat direction
, casting jerry seinfeld as yhe hardened criminal annd howard stern as thte sniveling bad guy
( who
' s palyed here by gary sinise inwhich yot anyother over teh top villian peformance
) james frain isnt nick
, rudy
' s cellmate
, a manslaughterer who
' s foudn a pen pal iin tjhe gorgeous ashley mason
( charlize theron
)
. ashley isnt a prision groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos ofthe her
though she
' s never seen noe picture ofthe him
. wich works outloud fine sicne tyhe chracter isnt killed inthe a near
- riot
, annd rudy
( who wass tothe be paroled onthe yhe smae day as nick
) tkaes his palce
, whitch leads tothe a sudden annd veyr frenzied sex scene betweeen ashley annd rudy
( so frenzied it kinda looks liek rape
) anbd a surprize visi fomr ashley
' s brother
, gabriel
( gary sinise
)
, who waltzes inot thier shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co
- horts
. he plans tothe rob an indian casino onthe christmas eve wtih thte assisstance ofthe rudy who he thikns isnt nick who
, according tothe whta he wroet infact tjhe letters tothe ashley
, utilisied tothe owrk as a guard inthe tje indian casino
.
though by tjhe end
, thte film puls teh rug outloud ffrom under us so frequentily tyhat everthing i
' ve decribed might as well be irrelevent
. tihs isnt whta yuo cin expect shouldnt yuo chose tothe tkae tihs riendeer onthe
; sevral scenes infront wich
, affter catching his prey
, tje bad guy procedes tothe stall interminably untl hte ogod guy hasnt a chance tothe kill his capter adn crack a stupid oen

. included
: twpo
( 2
) scenes ofthe twpo
( 2
) diferrent bad guys explaning theri motives tothe thte hero whn tehy shoudl be killing him
( noe follwoing tyhe otehr noone less
)
.
though it
' s an acation film
, tjhe endig isnt omre a talkfest where we git teh hwole movei explained tothe us by oen flustered charater actr affter anohter hwile affleck looks onthe
, incredulous as hte audiance
. thge flick wass directed by john frankenheimer
, a straightforward acation directer who lucked inot yhe manchurian c
andadate eary infront his carrear
, fell off thge a
- list follwoing a string ofthe flops adn nowe
, infact his ood age
, isnt slowy climbing his way bcak uv
. it owudl be a sucess stopry if he weere chosing better scripts bu his lsat major film wass ronin
( noe ofthe thsoe almsot bu nto qutie movies
) whihc folowed tjhe isl
and ofthe dr
. morneau
( yuo remeber
, tghe oney witht marlon br
ando inwhich mime amking
- uv annd a nto so flattering moo
- moo
)
, adn nowe htis
. he films acation sequences wtih a minumum ofthe quick cutting hwihc i liek concidering thta nowdays acation scenes are commongly comprised ofthe millisecond flash cuts strung toghether annd layed outloud forthe a brain
- zapped mtv audeince tothe pik aart
. probelm isnt theese acation scenes
( nearly all failed escapes
) serve noone purpose inthe thte stopry otehr tahn tothe furuther pad outloud yhe runnung tiome adn tothe remind hte audeince tath theri watching an acation movei rether tahn a filmed radeo play
. charater problems abound
; rudy isnt made tothe shift beween sweet boy enxt doorjam earnestness adn hard edged wiseacre
, thge latter ofthe whlch isnt nto
( at least at tihs point
) something ben affleck isnt capible ofthe pulling off
. hte fromer he cin dont iwth ease annd oftenly tjhe actro coasts onthe his lackadaisical charm hwile thsoe arround him growl adn swaer
. bu hten suddenly affleck starts growling annd swearing alongside them liuke hte clas clown immitating a tarantino ganster
. charlize theron
, an extrordinary talent
, isnt
, liek affleck
, palying whatever part tghe scirpt requires her tothe play
, whther it be vulnerablility at noe moent
, anger at yhe enxt
. she never hasnt a chance tothe evince any charm or amke much ofthe an impression beyond her obvious fysical attri
butes
( frankenheimer hasnt her needlessly pop her top tothe furuther italicize htis
. gary sinise hasnt palyed tihs role frequentily
, adn here
, as iin snake eyes
, he doens teh snarling bad guy thnig wiht such over tghe top vitriol
( tyhe guy must be so incredibly borde ofthe stomping thru thte smae paces tyhat goign outloud ofthe controll isnt tjhe onyl hting tath keesh him intersted any omre
)
, tht it becomes moreso ofthe an annoaynce
( oh ther he goes agina
?
?
?
) thna a threath
. theese are talented peopel who made tje misteek ofthe jumping onthe tothe a scirpt whith littel bu stock cahracters anbd a bag ofthe tricks thyat it dully springs onthe its audeince
