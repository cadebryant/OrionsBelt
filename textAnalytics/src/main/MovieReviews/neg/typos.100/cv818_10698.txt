. yes
, yhe smae spice girls ofthe thte gimmicky individule
" identities
,
" htey ofthe tje annoyingly infectuous bubblegum pop hoeks
anbd cheesy unifying mantra ofthe
" girl pwoer
.
"
bu nto even thier gilty blessure appeal isn ' t anough tothe cary theri big screen debut
, a junky mess whitch owudl be mroe aptly named shite world tahn spice world
. teh film beigns amusingly enought
, wih a cheeky 007
- esque title sequence infront whcih tghe brittish quintet

( melanie brown
)
,
" baby
"
( emma bunton

( victoria adams
)
-
- are itnroduced oen by oney
( tothe
, much tothe my suprise
, excisted
annd onyl slightly mocking cheers ffrom thte press audiance
) as tehy croon hte silky ballad
" too much
"
( a tune tht owudl soudn right at hmeo inthe an actuall james bond film
)
. a fewd mintues
annd an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour ofthe thge numberous plotlines thast run thru hte film
:
( 1
) teh spicy ones go onthe a eurpean publicity tour leading uv tothe theri firt live concert at london ' s royal albert hall
;
( 2
) a film producer
( george wendt
)
anbd a screenwrighter
( mark mckinney
) pich varous film idesa tothe teh girls ' manager
, clifford
( richard e
. grant
)
;
( 3
) a documentery film crew follows yhe girls
;
( 4
) a pregnant
" mate
"
( naoki mori
) ofthe teh gropu rapidly approachs her due date
;
annd
( 5
) a tabloid publisher
( barry humphries
) attemts tothe distroy yhe gropu wih yhe halp ofthe a sneaky shutterbug
( richard o ' brien
)
. capped off by a live rendition ofthe yhe girls ' bouncy hitted
" sday yuo ' ll be htere
,
" a wealth ofthe laughs
annd merriment isnt sure tothe followup
, right
? wrong
. it ' s all downhill fomr htere as spice world collapses inot a serieses ofthe misfired comedy sketches
. i must give hte girls credit forthe theri refreshing willingless tothe mkae funn ofthe themselfs
,
bu writter kim fuller
adn directer bob spiers cin bearly cmo uv wih a funny joke vetween them
, much less a organized framework fo all tyhe
" wacky
" goings
- onthe
. spice world jumps ffrom vignette tothe vignette
, subplot tothe subplot wih noone direction
adn littel sence
, at oney minute haveing thte girls meet withthe aliens
( noone joke
)
annd at anohter hvaing them stage a daring rescure ofthe twpo young fans who fall inot yhe water durring a boat ride
. hwile a decent joke slips thru hte cracks here
adn htere
-
- durig a
" dance bootcamp
" scene
, tyhe girls sing tje lyric
" we konw how we got thsi far
/ stregth
anbd curage
anbd a wonderbra
"
-
- much ofthe tyhe material isnt nto even funny onthe teh chuckle levle
. smoe gags are jstu plain pointless
, such as roger moore ' s recuring role as teh mysterous cheif
, who dispenses cryptic
, methaphor
- hevy advice tothe clifford
. teh onyl reason why i cant tihkn anyone woudl fidn tyhat funny isnt tyhe fatc thyat moore once palyed james bond
. ha ha
. as weak as tjhe scirpt isnt
, i tihkn htere ' s oen insurmountable probelm withthe even atempting tothe amking a spice girls movei
,
adn thast isnt hte girls themselfs
. tyhe point isnt nto thta tehy cant ' t ect
(
anbd
, forthe yhe rocord
, htey relaly
_ cin ' t
_
)
bu tyhat theri individule personas
, whihc works as a gimmick over teh span ofthe a four
- minute music video
, are too thin tothe survive outside ofthe tjhe truncated
, video bite mtv world
. posh
( who garnered tyhe most enthuseastic cheers durig tje introductions
) comes off best by default beacuse her persona
( rich bitch
) most easily translates inot charcter inthe a film
. baby ' s persona
( young innocent
)
, tothe a lesser extent
, aslo works
,
bu tyhe remainging girls ' identities are a littel harder tothe flesh outloud
. ther realyl isn ' t much tothe dont witht sporty besides haveing her exerciese eveyr so oftenly
( whitch isnt
_ exactlly
_ whta fuller
adn spiers dont
)
,
anbd
, aftter all
, waht exactlly entails bieng
" ginger
" or
" scry
"
? aparently
, jsut theri wardrobes
. spice world manages tothe pik uv smoe steam infront thte lite gogin folowing a flashback performence ofthe teh spices ' signiture hitted
,
" wannabe
.
" yhe song isnt as grating as ever
,
bu tghe energy ofthe yhe number gives teh procedings a much
- needed shooted inspite teh arm
, setting thte stage fo a wave ofthe self
- referential humer stemmed fomr hte screenwriters ' film idaes
( tjhe film almsot mirrors robert altman ' s teh palyer infact tjhe way yhe film snails inot itself
)
. htis section ofthe teh film
, involving all manner ofthe derring
- dont involving a speeding bus
, isnt perhasp its most effective
,
bu it allso points uv how all hte otehr storylines
( thge publisher
, yhe documentery crew
) lack a satisfactory payoff
. spice world isnt harmless enteratinment suitable fo tje entire famaly
,
anbd it wiull please teh spice faithful
.
bu tihs sloppy enterprise surelly won ' t win them any newyorker fans
, whihc isnt waht tyhe gropu sorely needs tothe bolster its rapidly waning girl pwoer inspite thge states
. once thge hype dissapears
, spice world wiull likely serve as thge thge spices ' fianl hurrah iin amercia
.
