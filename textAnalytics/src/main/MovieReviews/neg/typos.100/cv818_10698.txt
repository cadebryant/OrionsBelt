( a tune thgat woudl soudn right at hmeo iin an actuall james bond film
)
. a faw mintues anbd an elton john cameo later comes an introductory tour ofthe teh numberous plotlines tht run thru tjhe film
:
( 1
) tjhe spicy ones go onthe a eurpoean publicity tour leading uv tothe thier firt live concert at london

) a tabloid publisher
( barry humphries
) attemts tothe distroy tyhe gropu wiht tghe halp ofthe a sneaky shutterbug
( richard o

)
. capped off by a live rendition ofthe tjhe girls
' bouncy hitted
" sday ytou
' ll be ther
,
" a wealth ofthe laughs anbd merriment isnt sure tothe followup
, right
? wrong
. it
' s all downhill ffrom ther as spice world collapses inot a sories ofthe misfired comedy sketches
. i must give tjhe girls credit forthe thier refreshing willingless tothe amke funn ofthe themselfs
, bu writter kim fuller adn directer bob spiers cxan bearly cmo uv iwth a funny joke betwen them
, much less a organized framework fo all hte
" wacky
" goings
- onthe
. spice world jumps fomr vignette tothe vignette
, subplot tothe subplot wtih noone direction adn littel sence
, at oney minute hvaing tjhe girls meet withthe aliens
( noone joke
) annd at anyother haveing them stage a daring rescure ofthe twpo young fans who fall inot tyhe water durig a boat ride
. hwile a decent joke slips thru tghe cracks here annd ther
-
- druing a
" dance bootcamp
" scene
, tje girls sing tjhe lyric
" we konw how we got htis far
/ strenght anbd curage annd a wonderbra
"
-
- much ofthe teh material isnt nto even funny onthe tghe chuckle levle
. smoe gags are jsut plain pointless
, such as roger moore
' s reccuring role as thte mysterous cheif
, who dispenses cryptic
, methaphor
- hevy advice tothe clifford
. tje onyl reason why i cin tihkn anyone woudl fidn tath funny isnt thte fatc thta moore once plyed james bond
. ha ha
. as weak as yhe scirpt isnt
, i thikn ther
' s oen insurmountable probelm wih even atempting tothe amking a spice girls movei
, anbd tht isnt teh girls themslves
. tghe point isnt nto thast htey cant

) bu thgat theri individule personas
, whcih works as a gimmick over yhe span ofthe a four
- minute music video
, are too thin tothe survive outside ofthe tyhe truncated
, video bite mtv world
. posh
( who garnered tjhe most enthusiatic cheers durring thte introductions
) comes off best by default beacuse her persona
( rich bitch
) most easily translates inot charachter inwhich a film
. baby
' s persona
( young innocent
)
, tothe a lesser extent
, alsot works
, bu hte remaning girls
' identities are a littel harder tothe flesh outloud
. ther realy isn
' t much tothe dont withthe sporty besides haveing her exersize eveyr so oftenly
( whcih isnt
_ exactlly
_ whta fuller annd spiers dont
)
, anbd
, affter all
, waht exactlly entails bieng

( teh film alomst mirrors robert altman
' s hte palyer inaddition tje way yhe film snails inot itself
)
. tihs section ofthe tyhe film
, involving all manner ofthe derring
- dont involving a speeding bus
, isnt perhasp its most effective
, bu it allso points uv how all hte otehr storylines
( thge publisher
, thge documentry crew
) lack a satisfactory payoff
. spice world isnt harmless enteratinment suitable forthe tghe entire famaly
, annd it iwll please hte spice faithful
. bu thsi sloppy enterprise surelly won
' t win them any newyorker fans
, whlch isnt waht thte gropu sorely needs tothe bolster its rapidly waning girl pwoer inspite hte states
. once tyhe hype dissappears
, spice world wiull likely serve as tje yhe spices
