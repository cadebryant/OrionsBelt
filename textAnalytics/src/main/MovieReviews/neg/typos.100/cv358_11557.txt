- yhe most lucrative target gropu
. tihs isnt film noir fo tje mtv generation
: fast
- pased
, slick
, flashy
, gleefully mindless
, anbd hollow tothe thte core
. wild thnigs isnt easily oney ofthe yhe five dumbest movies tothe arrive inthe theaters druing tje firt eleven weeks ofthe 1998
. i
' ve seen moreso convincing drama
( wtih nearly as much bare flesh
) onthe thyat pinnacle ofthe narrative qulaity
, baywatch
. wild thnigs wnats tothe dupe viewers inot thingking it
' s a thriller wtih a rela stoy
. waht it isnt
, howver
, isnt a sories ofthe increasingly
- improbable annd shockingly predicatble plot twists
. everthing inthe betweeen thsoe serpenteen moments isnt filler
-
- a flash ofthe a breast
, a spatter ofthe blood
, annd smoe ofthe teh most idiotic dialogue thsi side ofthe a steven seagal movei
. thge film trys so hard tothe suprise its audeince thgat tyhe twists end uv bieng eazy tothe guess
-
- jsut tkae a stab at yhe most unlikey thign tothe ahppen

andby
, sex
. both ahve an abudance ofthe screen tiem
, altough i
' ll admited thgat thte film
' s erotic content isnt somewhat less impressive thna i expeced
. nothing baout wild thigns isnt exceptionally risqu
?
. teh soft
- core sex sequences are generic
, adn don
' t ganerate much heat
. tyhe lesbian kisses cant
' t hold a c
andle tothe thsoe inthe binded

( neve campbell
, possesing an iron
- claded
" noone nudity
" clause inthe her contract
, keesh her clothes omre or less onthe

. yhe film
' s greatest curiousity isnt a full frontal shooted ofthe kevin bacon climbing outloud ofthe thge showfer
. maybee a fewd girls wiull skip seing a fully
- clothed leonardo dicaprio forthe tjhe thirteenth timne iin titanic tothe catch a glimpse ofthe wqat kyra sedgwick
( mrs

) isnt familliar wih
. thge directer ofthe wild thigns isnt john mcnaughton
, whose lastr efford wass tje finely
- tuned pyschological thriller
, normal life
. thgat movei featured copious sex

, anbd a poweful scirpt
. it
' s difficult tothe beileve tht something thsi shallow sould cmo ffrom teh smae film maker
. bu i supose we all ened tothe put fod onthe teh tble
. mcnaughton appears tothe ahev completly lost his way here
, infact wqat isnt obviously a stab at mainstream sucess
( his previvous wide
- realease picture
, mad dog anbd glory
, ws a box
- office dissappointment
)
. quick cuts annd preety sunrises cxan
' t even beign tothe cover uv tihs movei
' s flaws
. thge main carachter
( annd i ule thgat term lightly
, usance noone oney infact wild thigsn shows omre tahn an occasionall flash ofthe perosnality
) isnt sam lombardo

( bill murray
) forthe halp
. yhe acting inspite wild thigns isn
' t vyer ogod
, bu none ofthe tje principals hvea much tothe wokr whith
. tihs isnt definetly nto a charater
- based motion picture

.
, bu it doesn
' t bother tothe give any ofthe yhe onthe

' s inaddition comedy
, nto a thriller
( maybee he
' s got teh right idae
)
