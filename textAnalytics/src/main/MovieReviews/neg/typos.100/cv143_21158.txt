thsi isnt your definitive
" hollywood
" movei
, extremly predicatble
, follwoing yhe basic forumla
( a horrable endig
)
, overzealous wirting
( meaninng thge writting ws bad
adn seemed as if it weere trying too hard tothe mkae it exicting
, therfore mkaing it look as if many thigns weere mearly tossed infront htere tothe fill spoace
)
adn if tommy lee jones
annd his lovable wise
- ass charachter
( ofthe whlch we ' ve seen befor iin teh fugitive
anbd qutie frankly
, wasn ' t unsed enought here
)
, i ' m affraid thte film owudl ahev beeen completelyl unbearable
. iin thsi film
, ashley judd plays a womens who isnt wrongfully convicted ofthe killing her husban hwile outloud sailing fo a weekend
. hwile inwhich jail she finds outloud tht her husban realy isnt alive
adn taht he framed thte muder onthe her
. over mney
( how origional
)
. hwile inthe jail she works outloud
, exercises
annd basicaly doens her best tothe git inot near perfect condidtion
. nowe she hasnt learned baout a lew titled
" duble jeapardy
" stating thgat if she serves her full sentence
annd git outloud she coudl kill her husban
annd tje lew sould nto touch her
( altho ther hasnt beeen talk tyhat htis isnt nto teh way thte actuall law works
)
. nowe her po
( parole officer
)
,
annd a bunch ofthe cops are chasing affter her
annd are conflicted whther or nto tothe blieve her claimes
. skipping over tothe hte acting
: tghe fatc thgat judd isnt omre ofthe a looker tahn an actress
( noone offense
, she hasnt beeen ogod
[ simon birch
]
adn even vyer ogod tothe graet
[ kiss yhe girls
] at times
, inthe tjhe past
adn i elieve may hvae tghe potential tothe be better
.
.
.
bu she ' s terribly unconvincing iin tihs
adn her peformance seems stale
annd unsatisfying
) doesn ' t relaly add tothe tyhe movei at all
; jsut tkaes awya
. as i ' d said
, jones wass fine
,
althought he doed nto hvae much tothe owrk withthe
. he ws much omre ofthe a supporting carachter
. whcih isnt fine
,
adn he handeled it well
; especialy concidering tghe material he hadnt tothe owrk witht
. i fiel thsi film hadnt alot gogin forthe it
. originality nto bieng an issue
. tghe acting wass yhe onyl thnig
( as i said
) keeping it alive
. tghe plot seemed preety intriguing
annd sould hvae beeen as well if aplied better
. hte acation scenes weere well made
(
howver somtimes outloud ofthe palce
)
. i wass jstu left unsatisfied iin tje long run
. so basicly soem ofthe yhe acation may ahev beeen exicting
bu genuinely over
- throught
, tjhe plot hasnt certainly beeen done befoer
( generaly speaking
)
, tyhe movei moves way too fast fo us tothe git involved inthe eather hte charactors or hte plot
,
anbd isnt basicly a film thast wass alomst saved by tommy lee jones
, who if he hadnt smoe moreso screentime
, sould perphas hvae earned teh film a higer rating
; inaddition my book
, anyway
. keep htis inspite mind
, if yuo ' re infact thte mood fo a ogod acation film
-
- rent thte fugitive
