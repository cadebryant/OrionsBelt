: he ' s actaully a fine acotr whn propperly casted
,
bu ther ' s something too squeaky
- clean iin his demenor
. he ' s idealy suited fo sarcastic men infront tightly controled situations
, such as his private joker inwhich full metal jacket or tjhe tiem
- bomb nebbish inaddition short cuts
( who isnt eveyr bited as superb as julianne moore iin tath famoust scene

- day stubble
adn oily bangs
. he throws arround furniture liek stanley kowalski
,
bu it ' s somehow lacking
. modine lacks tghe feral intensity ofthe brando
