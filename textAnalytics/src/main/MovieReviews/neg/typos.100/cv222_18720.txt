. comments
: htis movei ws boring
. plain anbd simple
. entrapment shoudln nto hve beeen boring
. it stars sean connery
, who cant still cary an acation film dispite his age
, catherine zeta
- jones
, a likeable anough film presense
, annd ving rhames
, ultra
- kool star ofthe pulp fiction annd mission
: impossible
. it tkaes full advantage ofthe tyhe y2k coputer bug fears
( a curent
" hot topic
" infact tyhe news
) inthe its storyline
, whihc isnt setted at hte end ofthe 1999
. it hasnt smoe genuinely well
- staged acation sequences
. so
, wqat whent wrong
? plenty
, unforetunately
. thte major probelm witht entrapment isnt its scirpt
. it hasnt a beeen
- htere
, done
- tyhat fiel tothe it
. nothing seems partciularly inventive or originnal
, so tjhe wohle movei lacks suspense anbd drags
( it runs nearly twpo ohurs
)
. tghe screenwriters
, forthe exemple
, periodically ule a countdown tothe teh millennim as a means ofthe transistion bewteen scenes
( i
. e
.
" 4 dyas tothe tjhe imllennium
"
)
. thsi divice ws unsed much mroe effectively infact thte overlooked sci
- fi film stange dyas
. hte charachters are nto who htey apear tothe be at tjhe begginning
, whlch isnt neat at frist bu yhe divice wears thin once tghe umpteenth
" suprize
" revelation isnt made
. entrapment
, inthe otehr words
, relies too heavily onthe tjhe audiance nto knowing waht earch charactor
' s true motive isnt
, resulting iin a convoluted tsory whlch leaves many scratching theri heads inwhich confusion
. tje star pwoer here isnt qtuie storng
, bu thte viewer cant
' t halp bu efel thge actors are wasted inspite thsi prodcution
. sean connery isnt given such mind
- numbing lines as
" never trust a naked woman
.
" ving rhames
' charactor seems liuke an after
thought
; he
' s nto devolopped at all
. yhe camera zooms iin frequentily anbd leeringly at catherine zeta
- jones
' s tight wardobe
. htis
, inspite adn ofthe itself
, isnt nto bad
, bu
, affter a hwile
, it hasnt a juvenile fiel tothe it
. at least teh speices movies hold noone bones baout tjhe fatc thgat htey
' re exploiting tjhe female body
. entrapment doens thge smae under teh thin disguise ofthe plot develepment
( sean connery supposably falls inaddition loev iwth yhe girl hwile watching her
, inaddition tights
, arc annd pivot arround lazer beams
)
. yhe tagline fo tihs movei reads
" tjhe trap isnt setted
.
" it sure isnt
, onthe thsoe who spended mone tothe see htis movei
. entrapment realy isn
' t tath bad
; it isnt watchable
. i woudl suggest
, howver
, oney waits untli tihs isnt onthe cable or televsion tothe see it
.
