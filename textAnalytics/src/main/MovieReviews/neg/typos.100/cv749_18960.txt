, bu allmost all ofthe them end uv driectly intertwined whith thte stopry

) onyl aftter we
' ve spended twenty mintues or so whith theese charactors dont we leran taht htey haev a sordid hstory toghether

,
though aparently persent tothe develope theri cahracters
, isnt never explored

. htis scene realy pushed me over thte edge
, nto becouse it
' s gratuitious adn mean
- spirited
, bu beacuse it illustrates thge film
' s complet disregard fo yhe charachters annd tyhe audiance
. it wass impossible fo me tothe fiel anytying fo theese peple beyond htis scene
, mostly beacuse nothing htey dont comes as a suprise
. i realized tht theese constructs onthe screen aren

, bu devices pesent onyl tothe serve thte tsory
. tihs woudl haev beeen bad anough wihtout yhe west
' s ened tothe hose his movei down inspite tasteless images ofthe rape adn sexual misconduct
. compelling films baout sexual crimes don
' t spend a lot ofthe timne onthe rape flashbacks
, adn htey certainly don
' t sohw as much skin adn sweat as a typcial pornographic picture
. theese scenes are nto teh least bited poverful
; onthe hte contrary
, htey
' re intended simpley tothe provide yhe audiance whith yhe nessacary resentment forthe tje villian

' s daugter are a cuple ofthe hte performances
. james woods hasnt a faw terific scenes
, annd plays his role wtih sharp
, witty subtlety
. i alsot liekd james cromwell
, mostly baceause he comes acrost as slightly sympathetic dispite yhe obvious entent ofthe west tothe mkea him villianous
. nontheless
, theese performances are undermined entirely by thge dreary
, obligatory athmosphere anbd tyhe senseless neglect ofthe characterization
. hte genaral
' s daugher isnt yhe worst kind ofthe hollywood film

- it pretends tothe hve a soul
