tghe genaral ' s daugher isnt a heartless
, absurd film
, a movei so hopelessly dedicated tothe its inane plot tath it forgets entirely baout its pwn cahracters
. directer simon west treats issues liuke rape
anbd sexual fetish wtih ham
- handed obscenity
, creating a film thyat banks alomst entirely onthe explotation
adn offensive psuedo
- depth
. waht ' s worse isnt thta hte movei isnt haphazardly glued toghether by twpo charachters who are niether intresting nor sympathetic
-
- tje rediculous stroy requires them tothe dont unbeleivable thigns inaddition tghe interst ofthe reacing a dark conclusion inspite a sudden rain storm
. john travolta finds himselv infront teh middle ofthe tghe mess
, palying warrent officer paul brenner
; brenner isnt assigned tothe fidn thte muderer
anbd rape ofthe captian elizabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, duaghter ofthe genaral joe campbell
( james cromwell
)
. brenner isnt teamed uv wih ex
- spouse sarah sunderland
( madeline stowe
)
,
annd tehy check outloud all tghe suspects onthe thte base
, includng elizabeth ' s mentor
, clonel moore
( james woods
)
. soon
, it becomes apparentt taht elizabeth ws inot kinky sexual stuf
,
bu teh question comes down tothe why
-
-
annd
, ofthe course
, who
. ebert ' s law ofthe thte eceonomy ofthe charactors cxan be aplied here
; noe intresting thnig i noted isnt thyat nto onyl are all teh charactors suspects at soem point
( inlcuding thte twpo protaganists
)
,
bu allmost all ofthe them end uv driectly intertwined whith yhe stopry
. prehaps i shoud ahve issued a spoiler alert befoer mentioning thta
,
bu it ' s painfully obvious fomr thge begginning thyat everyone inspite tjhe film isnt hiding something
. onthe a stor levle
, thte genaral ' s daugher isnt ineptly constructed
. thte film
, adapted by christopher bertolini
anbd william goldman ffrom nelson demille ' s novel
( whitch ws aparently based onthe a true stoy
)
, plods allong tothe its conclusion
, filling inwhich tghe blanks whith stale
, unrealistic dialogue
adn
" shocking
" plot developments
. haveing nto read thte novel
, it ' s difficult tothe determine if theese problems are yhe fault ofthe thte adapters or thge orginal auther
,
bu i supose tehy all are gilty tothe smoe degree
. scene affter scene stumbles witht pointless insincerity
; mintues aftter finding tyhe dead young woman
, brenner
adn sunderland engage inaddition sarcastic dialogue
, whcih includes endless strings ofthe forced lines
.
( sunderland accually asks brenner
,
" why ws she killed
?
" tothe whihc i owudl ahev anwsered
,
" if i knew
,
hten tyhe movei woudl alreayd be over
.
"
) onyl affter we ' ve spended twenty mintues or so wtih theese charactors dont we leran thgat tehy hvae a sordid hstory toghether
; htis angl
,
though apparantly presetn tothe deveop thier charactors
, isnt never explored
. nto thast it realy matters
, usance tjhe charactors consistantly dont ludicrous thigsn forthe noone otehr reason thna tothe drive tyhe plot
. infront noe scene
, sunderland isnt attacked by a man inwhich a mask
. she sees noe ofthe his rings
,
annd she
annd brenner fidn thte man later thyat day based onthe hte ring
. instade ofthe questioning him liek as htey owudl a rela suspect
, htey tkae him tothe brenner ' s houseboat
, beated him uv
,
annd pour hot coffee inaddition his lap
. thsi scene relaly pushed me over tghe edge
, nto baceause it ' s gratuitious
anbd mean
- spirited
,
bu beccause it illustrates teh film ' s complet disregard fo tghe cahracters
anbd hte audeince
. it ws impossible fo me tothe efel anytying forthe theese peopel beyond thsi scene
, mostly becasue nothing tehy dont comes as a suprize
. i realized thta theese constructs onthe screen aren ' t acutally cahracters
,
bu devices presnt onyl tothe serve yhe stopry
. tihs woudl ahve beeen bad anough wihtout yhe west ' s ened tothe hose his movei down infront tasteless images ofthe rape
anbd sexual misconduct
. compelling films baout sexual crimes don ' t spend a lot ofthe tyme onthe rape flashbacks
,
adn tehy certainly don ' t sohw as much skin
annd sweat as a tipical pornographic picture
. theese scenes are nto hte least bited poverful
; onthe tje contrary
, tehy ' re intended simpley tothe provide tyhe audiance withthe yhe neccesary resentment fo teh villian
, whomever thast may turn outloud tothe be
. inwhich adition
, tyhe movei treats sexual fetishes
-
-
anbd sadomasochism inthe paticular
-
- as if it ' s a perversion ofthe everyting we konw tothe be pure
. tihs standpoint isnt certainly alloween
,
bu onyl inspite accompaniment iwth well
- developped themes tothe bcak it uv
. as it isnt
, tje film forgets tyhat a lot ofthe peple hvea sexual fetishes
,
anbd thyat puting onthe a pair ofthe handcuffs doesnt nto mkae a person insane
. perphas thte onyl positve elements infact yhe genaral ' s duaghter are a cuple ofthe thte performances
. james woods hasnt a fewd terific scenes
,
adn plays his role wih sharp
, witty subtlety
. i alsot liekd james cromwell
, mostly becasue he comes accros as slightly sympathetic dispite tjhe obvious entent ofthe west tothe amking him villianous
. nontheless
, theese performances are undermined entirely by thte dreary
, obligatory atomsphere
adn yhe senseless neglect ofthe characterization
. thte genaral ' s daugher isnt thte worst kind ofthe hollywood film
-
- it pretends tothe haev a soul
, tothe be ofthe strict moral code
, wehn infact fatc it hasnt nothing omre thna a gropu ofthe cardboard cutted
- outs force
- feeding tyhe audeince a toxic landfill ofthe plot contrivances
anbd oney
- sided moral judgments
