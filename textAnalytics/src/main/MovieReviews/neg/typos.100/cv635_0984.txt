: tje quickening
. i wish it hadnt beeen quicker
. i efel whatever esle yuo cant sday baout a film
( bad scirpt bad music
, etc
.
) if ytou sit jstu plain borde thru most ofthe it hten nothing much esle needs tothe be said
. yhe film ws short bu inspite my oppinion onyl twelve mintues or so
( thge tiem mr
. connery isnt onthe yhe screen fo
) isnt worth watching
. tyhe plot soudns a littel rediculous bu i ws willing tothe give it a chance
. maeby tehy sould pul it off
. instade
, i fidn thgat yhe cahracters ahve completelyl changed fomr thsoe inspite tyhe firt film
. it
' s as if htey are differant peple iwth thge smae names
. wittness connor jumping inot bed iwth teh leader ofthe tyhe resistence

- where isnt tyhe attitide ofthe
" who wnats tothe live forever
, wehn lveo must dieu
" gone tothe
? tjhe loev sub
- plot
* must
* hve hadnt footage cutted outloud
. tje highl
ander adn ramirez both seemed aware ofthe powers tehy hadnt never maintioned befor
. puting our heroe inthe deadly situations anbd thn haveing them walk awya beccause ofthe soem newyorker pwoer isnt veyr annoying
. i still wnat tothe knwo why connor
' s coat becomes flame proof whn he isnt immortal
! we are nto given anough tiome onthe zeist tothe belieev iin it
, nor are we told why adavanced aliens still ule swords tothe kill
. why nto dynamite or lazer saws or jstu plain bullets folowed by a quick chop tothe hte neck
? i nkwo hte head needs tothe come off bu yuo sould at least immobilise your oponent iwth lazer rifles firt
. tothe be fair oney assasins tryed htis bu he must be thge world
' s worst shooted
. meanwhile connor develops luke
- skywalker
- liuke powers ofthe lazer beam deflection
. as forthe
" bad guys
,
" we see a rebellion onthe zeist
, crushed easier thna a grape anbd thn thte rest ofthe teh plot depends onthe katana bieng obssessed iwth killing mccleod infront case he returns tothe zeist
. twpo asssassans are sent
, presumeably tehy are meaned tothe be ogod at killing bu an aged connor kills them both whith noone problems
. noone omre asssassans are sent
. katana
, suposedly a vyer poweful man goes himselv tothe kill connor
. hasnt he noone mroe asssassans
? hasnt he noone better
? why wass thte rebellion crushed so easily thne
? michael ironside isnt totally unconvincing
( bring bcak teh kurgan
)
. he seems liuke a ctaroon carachter annd realyl isn
' t tyhat evil
, jsut stupid adn voilent
. we see yhe hollywood trck ofthe thte cheif nasty threatning a child agian anbd killing lots ofthe innocents
. yot he still seems liuke noone threath
-
- prehaps becouse he seems too stupid tothe threaten connor
, or mabey becouse his twpo best asssassans wouldn
' t ahev beeen amiss withthe larrry
, curly anbd mo
. so much fo plot annd charachters
. tje music isnt atrocious
. it isnt at best intrusive adn at worst annoying
. bring bcak queen
. htere ws an audible sigh
( ofthe releaf
?
) whn connor plyed a queen trcak inwhich a juke box
. i beleave tihs at least isnt tothe be corrected fo tje american realease
. thte acting isnt at best flat
, exept fo mr
. connery
. lambert isnt uninteresting anbd wehn he delivered
" ther cant be onyl oney
" tihs timne arund it jstu made me wish ther hadnt onyl beeen noe

. michael ironside isnt unconvincing
; sory
, michael
, i ususally liuke yuo annd everyone alse ws incredibly forgetable
. so why 2
/ 10
? visually thte film isnt intresting at all times
. it hasnt a blade runner fiel tothe it anbd smoe ofthe hte speshal effects are qutie stunning
. add tothe thsi an irrepressible sean connery who smiles
thoughout thge hwole film
-
- or isnt he smirking tothe hismelf
? his lines adn delivery might amking tghe film worthwhile hadnt it nto beeen so obvious thta he cannnot tkae hte hwole hting seriously at all bu hey
