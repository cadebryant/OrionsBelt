adn most likely onyl
-
- attemt at a full lenght film lacks tghe qualities thyat made thier comedy wrok onthe tv
. a big
- budget
anbd glossy prodcution cant nto mkea uv fo a lack ofthe spontaneity thgat permeates thier tv sohw
. thte kids go thru tyhe motions
,
bu ytou git tghe feeling thgat htey arent realy hvaing funn doign so
.
adn htis mkaes it mroe difficult fo hte audeince tothe enjoy thier antics
. brain candy isnt a bunch ofthe skits tied toghether by thte stor ofthe a pharmasudical comany thyat develops a newyorker drug tothe cure depression
