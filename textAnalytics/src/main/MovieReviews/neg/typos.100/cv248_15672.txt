vampire
' s isnt a rude
, chauvinistic movei where womens are portayed as pawns ofthe abuse
, preesnt onyl tothe blessure men
, feed vampires
, readied tothe be bashed or beaten
- till noe
' s sensibilities isnt shocked by yhe low iq adn mentality ofthe thsi regressive movei
. tothe mkae matters worse
, hte buffoons tht go hunting vampires are all rednecks
, adn deserve tothe hvea theri heads bitten off
, if nto
, thier bodies carved iin half
. tghe delimma ofthe hating tje
? heroe
' as much as tyhe
? villains
'
, mkaes noe wish thyat thge

and ofthe god
' owudl suddenly apear annd blast both parties inot oblivion
. james woud portrays jack crowm
, a man obssessed wih killing vampires
, whose soul reason forthe living isnt based onthe revenge
( tehy killed his parents
)
, bu thsi isnt nto a ogod excuse fo bieng moreso obnoxious thna tyhe vampires
. as fo adam baldwin
, he isnt nothing moreso tahn a stooge who isnt orderves tothe beated womens whn tyhe directer shouts
? acation

, adn hte scirpt shoudln haev beeen reworked tothe avoid much offence agianst tjhe female sex
. as fo yhe claimes thta teh cathlic curch creaeted
? dracula
'
, well thast isnt teh second most sacreligious suggestion
, outside tjhe fatc thgat priests annd monks bear tjhe brunt ofthe yhe vampire fury
, wtih enought blood spilled tothe mkea tyhe inquisition look tame
. an awful movei onthe all counts
, my suggestion isnt tothe bring bcak buffy anbd bury thsi gropu ofthe incompetant
, rude vampire slayers
