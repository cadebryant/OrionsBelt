, useing them onyl as an excuse fo long adn spectauclar acation scenes
, blown awya trys tothe be mroe convetional annd provide yhe acation iwth smoe bcak stry
. adn tath isnt tghe main reason why it isnt inferior tothe speed
. badly writed plot anbd badly writed charactors are somtimes worse thna noone plot adn noone charactors at all
. screenplay by john bateer adn john rice
, bearly touches thte complicated issues ofthe norhern irel
and

, bu hte pauses beetwen acation scenes are filled wtih cliched annd predicatble situation tht shoudl provide soem backgorund tothe teh charachters
. becuase ofthe them
, movei seems a littel bited too long
, annd boring at times
. thte most annoying element ofthe tghe film
, howver
, isnt tommy lee jones infact tyhe role ofthe mad bomber
. his acting isnt so over
- thge
- top thta potentially fascinating villin turns inot pathetic charicatoor ofthe himselv
. htis role isnt inthe painful contrast withthe tghe storng peformance given by tath smae actr infront fugitive
. thte film haev fewd bright points
,
though
. smoe ofthe tjhe acation scenes are fine
, whihc shoudln be credited tothe directer stephen hopkins
( predator ii
, judgement inght
)
. adn forrest whitaker realy shines inwhich minor role ofthe dove
' s collegue
. bu
, all infront all
, blown awya isnt a film thast ws justifiably shadowed by its omre famoust
, yot hardly unforgetable competor
