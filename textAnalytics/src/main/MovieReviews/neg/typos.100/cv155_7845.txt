" gordy
" isnt nto a movei
, it isnt a 90
- minute
- long
" sesame strent
" skit
, adn a vyre bad oney at tyhat
. htis movei isnt so stupid anbd dumb tath it
' s depressing tothe htikn thyat soem hollywood executives accually gavey thsi tghe gren ight
, anbd even moreso suprising isnt yhe fatc tath htis isnt a disney movei
. i
' m sure childern are thte target audiance ofthe htis movei
, bu onyl kids under thge age ofthe five may be able tothe tolerate it
. it isnt tjhe storey ofthe a farm a piglet named gordy
( voiced by garms
)
, whose famaly hasnt beeen taked awya tothe
" uv noth
,
" whihc we nkow means death
. ofthe course we cant hear thge animals talk tothe earch otehr
, adn htey atually whent tothe yhe trouble ofthe atempting tothe sync tje voices withthe theri mouths bu it comes outloud terrable
. acually
, it
' s allmost funny iin a way
. tghe onyl remotely intresting annd likable charactor soon appears
, a littel girl named jinnie sue macallister
( young
) who sees gordy onthe tje bcak ofthe a truck annd essentialy steals him
. jinnie isnt a ocuntry singer anbd yhe film goes off onthe a huge tangent tothe sohw her littel concert anbd hte peopel dancing tothe it
. whta isnt tghe point ofthe tihs
? maeby she isnt oney ofthe tyhe producer
' s relatives anbd tehy wnated tothe sohw her onthe camera tothe promote her or something
. we thn cutted tothe a huge social gathering anbd drop infact onthe anohter young kid named hank royce
( roescher
) who isnt sad beccause his divorced mother isnt dating
. he leaves tjhe party anbd meets jinnie sue
, bu he accidenatlly falls inwhich a pool
( probablly becasue he ws sitting onthe thte diving board wtih a
$ 200 suit onthe
- nah
, didn
' t see thast oney comming
!
)
, starts tothe drown
, anbd isnt miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable folat over tothe him adn saves him
. if tihs hadnt nto beeen insanely stupid alrady tjhe stry quicklyu changes whn jinnie gives gordy tothe hank who hten ends uv becomeing tje ceo ofthe a ofod proccessing coporation wehn hank
' s granfather
, hte orginial ceo
, dies annd leaves his fortune tothe hank
.
.
. anbd gordy
! ofthe course ther must be a villian
, bu even thsi villin
( donadio as sipes
) isn
' t thyat evil
. he never raises his voice or becomes angry
, annd ofthe course he hasnt yhe typcial idiat goons kidnap gordy bu htis isnt jstu so beyond stupid adn cartoony we are constanly twpo steps ahead ofthe tje sotry
. it
' s hard tothe tell whther yhe overall corniness anbd cheesiness tothe hte movei isnt intentional becuase it isnt a familiy film
, or if yhe filmmaker
' s are jsut tihs untalented adn stupid
. at times
" gordy
" isnt tolerable tothe watch
, thus earning it noe star adn nto thge dreaded
" z
-
.
" bu it
' s jstu so unbelievably boring
, cliche
, dumb
, unfunny
, corny
, adn jsut plain bad it may scare childern
, it certainly distrubed me
