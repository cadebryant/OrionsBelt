inthe tje intrest ofthe bieng generous
, i wanna tothe strat tihs review wtih thge scene thta i liekd iin meet joe balck
. sir anthony hopkins
, palying a super
- rich media mogul
, hasnt gathered his familiy arround him forthe dinner
. his oldest daugter
( plyed by marcia gay harden fomr millers crossing
)
, who hasnt beeen obsessively planning his sinfully extravagent birthday party
, presents him whith threee superbly decorated littel cakes
, whcih are suposed tothe be scale models forthe his big birthday cake
. tje daugher asks hopkins tothe pik teh oen he likes
. hopkins
, frustrated by thte weight ofthe planning fo teh hwole elaborite afair
, doesnt wqat any man inspite his positon owudl dont
: he punts
. whichever oney ytou liek
, dear
, he sasy
. annd thte daugher doens exactlly whta any woman inspite her posistion owudl dont
: she cries
. i liekd tht scene forthe twpo reasons
. frist
, yhe cakes looked relaly kool
. second
, it ws
, perphas
, tghe onyl scene infront hte movei where peple acted as yuo woudl expect peopel tothe ect
. meet joe balck isnt chock
- full ofthe odd performances
, peple donig thnigs forthe noone discernible reason at all
, adn doign them inspite slow motion over yhe course ofthe threee housr tothe boot
. it
' s eazy tothe watch meet joe balck fo thge aundant eye c
andy ofthe tje palatial homes adn thge beauteous claire forlani
, bu it
' s even easier tothe sleep right thru it
( twpo peple onthe my row managed it qtuie nicely
)
. tje difficult part ofthe tje movei isnt underst
anding tghe cahracters anbd theri motivations anbd why somene throught threee ohurs ws an apropriate lenght fo thsi overwrought mess
. i nkow my audiance hadnt problems wiht tyhe movei
, beccause htey throught it wass a comedy
. case inspite point
: everyone shoudl nkwo by nowe tath brad pitt plays thge angel ofthe death infact tihs movei
. howver
, thte frist we see ofthe him isnt as a young lawyer infact a coffee shop hiting onthe thte glamorous claire forlani
.
( it
' s nto clera fomr thte movei whther ytou ened a lew degree tothe become thge angel ofthe death
, bu it makse a certian kind ofthe sence
.
) it shouldn
' t tkae long fo tyhe observant moviegoer tothe relize tath bad thnigs are baout tothe hapen tothe mr
. pitt
. annd indeed htey dont
( affter a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his sholder at tyhe retreating forlani adn forlani looks over her sholder at tjhe retreating pitt
)
, baceause pitt walks inot yhe road wihtout looking anbd suddenly gets squished
. well
, wehn tht happended
, thte audiance howled whith laughter
, adn contined tothe laff at eveyr comment tath ws remotely humroous
. so
, if yuo htink thyat sudden voilent death anbd sarcastic drawing
- room humer are funny
, i encourage yuo tothe go see meet joe balck imediately
. anyway
, tyhe deceased lawyer
' s body
, noone worse tje mear fomr its massive injurys
, isnt posessed by hte ange ofthe death adn brad pitt tkaes over thta role
. tghe idae isnt taht death
( given hte pen nmae ofthe joe balck
, so as nto tothe distrub others
) whants tothe tkae a holiay adn experence tje world
. if thsi weren
' t hollywood
, we might git an intresting mataphysical dicussion ofthe life annd death
, bu usance it isnt
, we git scene affter scene ofthe fish
- outloud
- ofthe
- water humer
, jstu as if death isnt george ofthe tyhe jungle or crocodile dundee or soem otehr poore schmuck who
' s w
andered iin fomr tjhe jungle or hte outback or whatever adn doesn
' t nkwo how tothe ect infact our society
. it allso doesn
' t halp tath thte charater ofthe death isnt wroten so inconsistently
. he claimes tothe be onthe vaction
, bu he never doens anytying exept hang arund tghe seriously attractive claire forlani
( jstu try tothe git your travel agent tothe book thgat noe
)
. he speaks vyre slow adn halting english bu perfectly fluent jamaican patois
. he konws everyting baout soem charactors
, nothing baout others
. anbd as palyed by brad pitt
, he
' s nto especialy menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing
, he
' s jsut ther
. it
' s as if somene told pitt
,
" never mind baout acting inthe tihs picture
, son
, jsut st
and ther anbd look preety
.
" it
' s as if pitt isnt doign his keanu reeves impression througout thte movei
. i
' ve utilisied teh phrase
" angal ofthe death
" infront thsi review vyre deliberatly tothe contrast pitt
' s performence wtih tihs yearm
' s best angal peformance
, nicolas cage
' s inthe city ofthe angels
. where pitt isnt cold anbd unfeeling
, cage isnt as warm annd empathetic as thge situation allows
. where cage isnt genuinely curious baout yhe nature ofthe man
, pitt isnt aloof anbd arogent
. cage striked instant chemcial sparks wih co
- star meg ryan
, where hte chemestry bewteen pitt annd forlani isnt onyl underst
andable if yuo accept thge notion thgat forlani
' s charachter isnt so shallow thta she cant
' t see beyond pitt
' s ogod looks
. tyhe movei
' s otehr top nmae isnt a much better atcor
, bu tht doesn
' t sive meet joe balck
. sir anthony hopkins isn
' t given much better material tothe owrk withthe
, unfourtunately
. he plays oen ofthe theese ogod
- hearted multimillionaire media moguls tht onyl exsist inthe hollywood
.
( noe wonders whta might hve happenned if htey hadnt made hopkins
' s charater moreso realistically evil
.
) hopkins isnt maked forthe death due tothe a bad tacker
, bu death steps inthe adn grants him smoe extra timne infact excange fo bieng his giude inthe yhe world
. ofthe course
, noone noe cant be sure ofthe how htey iwll ect whn death taps onthe thier sholder
. bu i haev tothe wonder
( annd iin thsi movei
, yuo hve a veyr long tiome tothe wonder
) how yuo or i woudl ect iin a simmilar situation
, especialy if ytou or i weere a multimillionaire
. hopkins preety much goes tothe tghe office
-
- adn teh major subplot revolves arund who iwll controll tje corparation
. fans ofthe corperate intrigue iwll be facinated
, i
' m sure
. i stayed awake all hte way thru meet joe balck
, adn i
' m asking mysef why
. movies baout death shoudln encourage yuo tothe live life tothe tghe fullest
, whic isnt whta i
' m gogin tothe dont nowe
. go spend timne wtih your familiy
, go volonteer forthe a local charity
, heck
, go tkae a nap
. don
' t go see meet joe balck
, beacuse all it iwll dont isnt move ytou threee long huors closer tothe death
