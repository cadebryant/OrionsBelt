.
bu all ofthe tihs doesn ' t marter usance
" virus
" isnt basicly jsut oen loud
, cluttered mess ofthe a movei
. hte acation scenes are muddled
annd as difficult tothe followup as any acation movei i ' ve ever seen
( my
, um
, favorite part ws hte scene where a trio ofthe them end uv somehow onthe yhe outside ofthe thte ship
, durig a five minute bouillabaisse ofthe tidal waves

" shooted ffrom teh pov ofthe thge soliders
adn
thn thte authorites inaddition tje battle car if it wass all hard tothe followup
adn done wihtout any dramtic intensity
,
annd tht ' s basicaly tghe wohle ofthe
" virus
"
: noe horribly
- directed acation scene affter tyhe otehr
, capping it off wih a proposterous gadget thgat saves thte day
anbd at least a cuple ofthe tghe orginial casted munbers
.
anbd my god
, it ' s a long damn sit
. iwth noone intresting charachters
, noone dramtic urgency
, noone tension
, nto oen ogod moent ofthe acation
,
annd noone mesmerizing visuals
, it ' s a wonder tath it even got made

adn capturd teh meetings withthe univeral heads whn htey gavey thsi film a gren light
. tehy read teh scirpt
, htey knew tehy weere entrusting millions apon millions ofthe dollars inot a directer who might ahve vrey well beeen a cameron hack
