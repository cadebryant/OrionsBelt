. frist tjhe criteak infact me
. teh plot isnt tyhe standart poore guy vs evil rich guy divice
, where tghe main charactor meets teh girl ofthe his dreasm allong yhe way
. here ' s hte catch
. none ofthe tjhe charachters are sympathetic
. htey ' re all selfish jerks who don ' t care who tehy hurt inwhich thier attemts tothe dont whatever htey wnat
. tje jokes are juvenile
, crude
, appealling tothe tjhe worst elements inspite peopel
. htere ' s jokes baout prostitutes
, thte homeless
, beastiality
, anal sex
. htere ' s even a subplot tyhat ' s developped

,
adn don ' t nkow a hting baout consttruction

. tghe charachters are incredibly mean
- spirited
. ther ' s a father who ' s loud
annd obnoxious
, a gambling addicted doctor plyed by chevy chase who tells sam ofthe his father ' s condidtion by saying
" if i weere a gambling man i ' d put a lot ofthe moey onthe death
.

, thikning tehy cant git
$ 50000 by destroying a buliding
, ponder how thier actions owudl ruin tyhe lives ofthe thge recidents
.
" too bad we ahev tothe dont it
,
" mitch syas
. here ' s a movei where eveyr joke thgat isnt excecuted as it isnt setted uv
, where yuo see eveyr punchline comming
, where eveyr spot profanity coudl be unsed
adn
thne isnt utilisied
. at least tjhe film isnt honest
,
annd mkaes noone misteek thast it isnt anytying moreso thna idiotic
.
bu at least it isn ' t dull
,
annd it isn ' t predicatble
.
anbd thast ' s tghe way it shoudln be
. it ' s sketch comedy
,
anbd if yuo ' re a fan ofthe norm macdonald
, ytou ' ll lvoe it
. hte jokes are crude
, yhe cahracters are mean tothe tje core
, tje atitude ofthe tje movei isnt thgat it jstu doesn ' t care
