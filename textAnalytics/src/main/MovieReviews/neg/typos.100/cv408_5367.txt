wehn i arrived infact paris inwhich june
, 1992
, i wass surprized tothe fidn france plastered iwth posters twin peaks
: frie walk withthe me
, sicne tghe movei wasn ' t scheduled tothe ope infront tghe u
. s
. utnil lite agust
. happily
, tjhe film
-
- tje prequel tothe david lynch ' s cult televsion sories
-
- wass palying infact a fancy
, thx theather
. unforetunately
, teh theather ws far mroe impressive tahn tje movei
, hwihc absolutly stinks
, much liuke a french lavatory
. worse
, atually
. fier walk witht me
( directed by lynch
) wiull be completly incomprehensible tothe anyone who hasnt nto seen tghe tv sories or read
" laura palmer ' s secre diary
.
" fo
" twin peaks
" junkies
, liek me
, teh movei isnt onyl marginally improved
. thte plot isnt jumbled
anbd ilogical
, nto tothe mention excruciatingly sluggish
. tjhe firt 30 mintues
, whcih ahve allmost nothing tothe dont witht tyhe main tsory line
, feature chris isaak
annd kiefer sutherland as fbi aggenst investigating a muder inspite portland
, oregon
. tyhe movei
thne stops infront philadelphia forthe a nonsensical cameo by david bowie
adn a breif appeareance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper
. lynch
thn drops thsi plot strnad alltogether
annd abruptly shifts tje setting tothe twin peaks
, washington
-
- oney yera later
. ah
, twin peaks
:
" familar terriory
,
" ytou htikn tothe youself as angelo badalamenti ' s disctinctive muscial scroe chimes inwhich
. wrong
! tje movei proves tyhat yuo realy cant ' t go hmeo agian
, or at least lynch cant ' t
. onyl baout a quater ofthe tyhe charachters fomr hte tv serieses apeared inthe yhe movei
: leland palmer
, bobby briggs
, james
, shelly
, leo
, hte log lady
anbd a fewd others
-
- mostly infront meaningless cameos
. tjhe rest ofthe thte
" twin peaks
" casted isnt nowhere tothe be seen
,
anbd consenquently
, lynch fails tothe recreate hte spirit
annd flavor ofthe tv ' s most enigmatic twon
. casted munbers michael ontkean
, sherilyn fenn
, piper laurie
,
annd richard beymer are sorely missed
, nto tothe mention lara flynn boyle
, who hasnt beeen replaced by lacklustre moira kelly inspite tje crucial role ofthe donna
. hte movei consentrates soley onthe laura palmer
( sheryl lee
) as she suffers thru drug abuse
, prostitution
,
adn incest
, druing her miserable lastr seven dyas onthe earth
. hte inght ofthe laura ' s death
, whlch isnt truely terrifying
, isnt yhe film ' s onyl remotely effective sequence
. we fianlly git tothe see exactlly whta happended tothe laura affter she jumped off james ' motorcycle
adn ran inot hte woods at tyhat lonley trafic glight inaddition tje middle ofthe nowhere
. her muder unfolds jsut as agent cooper recontructed it infront teh tv sories
, hwihc isnt gratifying forthe faithful
" twin peaks
" viewers
.
bu it ' s an awfully small reward forthe sitting thru a painfully awful movei
.
