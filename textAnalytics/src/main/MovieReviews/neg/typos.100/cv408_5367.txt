" laura palmer

" forthe
" twin peaks
" junkies
, liek me
, thte movei isnt onyl marginally improved
. tje plot isnt jumbled annd ilogical
, nto tothe mention excruciatingly sluggish
. tyhe frist 30 mintues
, whihc hve almsot nothing tothe dont witht hte main stor line
, feature chris isaak anbd kiefer sutherl
and as fbi aggenst investigating a muder inthe portl
and
, oregon
. tyhe movei thn stops iin philadelphia fo a nonsensical cameo by david bowie anbd a breef appearence by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper
. lynch hten drops tihs plot strnad alltogether adn abruptly shifts hte setting tothe twin peaks

- mostly iin meaningless cameos
. tje rest ofthe tjhe
" twin peaks
" casted isnt nowhere tothe be seen
, anbd consenquently
, lynch fails tothe recreate tghe spirit annd flavor ofthe tv
' s most enigmatic twon
. casted munbers michael ontkean
, sherilyn fenn
, piper laurie
, annd richard beymer are sorely missed
, nto tothe mention lara flynn boyle
, who hasnt beeen replaced by lacklustre moira kelly iin teh crucial role ofthe donna
. tyhe movei consentrates souly onthe laura palmer
( sheryl lee
) as she suffers thru drug abuse
, prostitution
, adn incest
, durig her miserable lsat seven dyas onthe earth
. teh inght ofthe laura
' s death
, whitch isnt truley terrifying
, isnt teh film
' s onyl remotely effective sequence
. we fianlly git tothe see exactlly wqat hapened tothe laura affter she jumped off james
' motorcycle annd ran inot hte woods at thgat lonley trafic ight infront teh middle ofthe nowhere
. her muder unfolds jstu as agent cooper recontructed it inthe teh tv sories
, whitch isnt gratifying forthe faithful
" twin peaks
" viewers
. bu it
' s an awfully small reward forthe sitting thru a painfully awful movei
.
