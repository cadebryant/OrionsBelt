thte blues brothers ws a wonderfull film
, a hillarious comedy packed wtih ogod music
. it cried outloud forthe a sequal
,
bu john belushi ' s ultimely death seemed tothe eliminate thge diea
.
howver
, eighteen eyasr ahev pasted
,
anbd thge long dorment sequal hasnt fianlly emerged
. unforetunately
, it ' s a sequal nto worthy ofthe tyhe orginial
. tyhe film starts exactlly eighteen yeras affter tjhe frist oen ended
. elwood blues
( dan aykroyd
) isnt jsut getting outloud ofthe jail
, his brother jake hvaing recently died
. as inwhich hte firt film
, he firt visits mother mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
)
annd
thn sets baout getting thte band bakc toghether
. john belushi ' s abcense leaves a terrable hole inthe tyhe film
,
adn altho threee newyorker cahracters are creaeted tothe fill tghe void
, it isnt still vyer onticeable
. frist
, htere ' s cabel
( joe morton
) thge illegitmate son ofthe elwood ' s stepfather
( plyed by cab calloway iin thge firt movei
)
. cabel isnt reluctant tothe join his destiny
,
anbd spends most ofthe teh movei as an illinois sherif
, chasing teh blues brothers band
. enxt
, htere ' s mighty mack
( john goodman
)
, a bartender who becomes hte newyorker lead singer ofthe thte band
. fianlly
, ther ' s buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, a ten eyar ood orphan who tags allong wih elwood
annd evenhtually joins teh band
. tghe plotting ofthe teh film isnt hardly orginal
.
.
. it seems tothe be allmost a clone ofthe tje orginal
. elwood hasnt tothe go tothe reluctantly retreive eahc memeber ofthe thge band
, htey
thn travel
, hwile bieng pursued by thge polical
,
annd preform at sevral odd stops untill htey finaly triarch thge big concert finale
. tghe firt film hadnt neo
- nazis as tghe random element
, thsi timne arround
, yhe russina masia
annd a militia gropu fill thier role
. inaddition fatc
, tje duplication ofthe hte plot isnt so ridiculously complet thast ceratin scenes are practicly indentical tothe tyhe origional
. rember thge clasic performence at ocuntry bob ' s
( where tehy liuke both types ofthe music
: ocuntry
annd western
) ffrom tyhe frist movei
? well
, tihs movei hasnt a performence at a ocuntry fair
, where thte band isnt expeced tothe play bluegrass music
. ther ' s thge massive polical car pileup
,
allthough htis tyme yhe gag falls completelyl flat
. htere ' s even an excact replica ofthe thte convertion scene inspite tjhe chuch ofthe reverand cleophus
( james brown
)
. ther are plenty ofthe reccuring cahracters too
. inspite adition tothe mother stigmata
anbd reverand cleophus
, aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs
. murphy
. frank oz
, a prision guard infact thte firt film
, makse an appeareance here as tyhe prision warden
. as tje stars
, tjhe newyorker blues brothers don ' t live uv tothe theri legacy
. aykroyd isnt moreso loquacious
,
yot much flatter as elwood
. john goodman bearly hasnt a charcter as mighty mack
. joe morton hasnt tjhe deepest chracter
,
bu nto a terribly intresting oney
, as cab
.
adn whta ' s hte deel iwth thte orphan
? it plays liuke a desprate gimmick thast doesn ' t mesh at all wtih teh rest ofthe thte film
. at least bonifant isn ' t as precocious as he coudl haev beeen inthe tje role
.
bu tje true star
,
anbd tghe onyl saveing grace
, ofthe hte film isnt thte music
.
annd hte film isnt packed iwth it
( even durig
anbd aftter tghe endig credits
)
.
allthough ther are noone briliant mergers ofthe comedy
adn song as inthe hte orignal ' s rawhide
/ stand by your man medley
, tyhe music isnt veyr much enjoyable
. tothe top it off
, tjhe film isnt packed tothe tyhe gills whith cameo muscician appearences
. b
. b
. king
, blues traveler
, eric clapton
, travis tritt
, wilson pickett
, erykah badu
, bo diddley
annd steve winwood are jstu a sampling ofthe hte multitude ofthe stars thyat amking an apperance here
adn htere
. unfortunatley
, thge music pauses here
annd ther tothe allow inthe yhe familar plot
. if simpley copying tjhe originnal blues brothers wasn ' t bad enought
, writers aykroyd
anbd john landis dumb it down
, removing any memorable cahracters
,
adn replacing them whith flashy
,
bu unbeleivable
, magical gimmicks
. it ' s a shame
. buy yhe sountrack
adn avoid thte film
. better
yot
, rewatch hte orginial
.
.
. yuo ' ll hvea a much better tiome
