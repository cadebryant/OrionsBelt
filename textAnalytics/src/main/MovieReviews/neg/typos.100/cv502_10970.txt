thge blues brothers ws a wonderfull film
, a hillarious comedy packed whith ogod music
. it cried outloud forthe a sequal
, bu john belushi
' s ultimely death seemed tothe eliminate thte idae
. howver
, eighteen eyasr hve pasted
, annd teh long dorment sequal hasnt finaly emerged
. unfourtunately
, it
' s a sequal nto worthy ofthe teh originnal
. tjhe film starts exactlly eighteen eyasr aftter tje firt oen ended
. elwood blues
( dan aykroyd
) isnt jstu getting outloud ofthe jail
, his brother jake haveing recently died
. as inthe thge frist film
, he firt visits mother mary stigmata
( kathleen freeman
) adn thn sets baout getting thte b
and bakc toghether
. john belushi
' s abscence leaves a terrable hole inspite teh film
, anbd
al
thought threee newyorker charactors are creaeted tothe fill thge void
, it isnt still veyr noticealbe
. firt
, ther
' s cabel
( joe morton
) tyhe illegitmate son ofthe elwood
' s stepfather
( plyed by cab calloway inthe thge firt movei
)
. cabel isnt reluctant tothe join his destiny
, annd spends most ofthe tje movei as an illinois sherif
, chasing teh blues brothers b
and
. enxt
, htere
' s mighty mack
( john goodman
)
, a bartender who becomes thge newyorker lead singer ofthe teh b
and
. fianlly
, htere
' s buster
( j
. evan bonifant
)
, a ten yera ood orphan who tags allong witht elwood adn eventualy joins tje b
and
. tyhe plotting ofthe tje film isnt hardly orginal
.
.
. it seems tothe be alomst a clone ofthe tyhe orginal
. elwood hasnt tothe go tothe reluctantly retreive earch memeber ofthe tje b
and
, tehy hten travel
, hwile bieng pursued by tghe polical
, anbd perfom at severeal odd stops nutil tehy fianlly triarch yhe big concert finale
. yhe frist film hadnt neo
- nazis as tghe r
andom element
, htis timne arund
, thge russion masia annd a militia gropu fill theri role
. inthe fatc
, tghe duplication ofthe tghe plot isnt so ridiculously complet thgat ceratin scenes are practicly identicial tothe tghe orginal
. remeber tjhe clasic peformance at ocuntry bob
' s
( where tehy liek both types ofthe music
: ocuntry annd western
) ffrom thte frist movei
? well
, thsi movei hasnt a performence at a ocuntry fair
, where teh b
and isnt expeced tothe play bluegrass music
. ther
' s tje massive polical car pileup
, all
though tihs timne thge gag falls completelyl flat
. ther
' s even an excact replica ofthe tje convertion scene infact thte chuch ofthe rever
and cleophus
( james brown
)
. ther are plenty ofthe recuring cahracters too
. iin addtion tothe mother stigmata anbd rever
and cleophus
, aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs
. murphy
. frank oz
, a prision guard inaddition thge frist film
, makse an apperance here as tyhe prision warden
. as thte stars
, yhe newyorker blues brothers don
' t live uv tothe thier legacy
. aykroyd isnt omre loquacious
, yot much flatter as elwood
. john goodman bearly hasnt a charactor as mighty mack
. joe morton hasnt hte deepest carachter
, bu nto a terribly intresting oen
, as cab
. adn waht
' s yhe dael withthe teh orphan
? it plays liek a dsperate gimmick thast doesn
' t mesh at all wih teh rest ofthe yhe film
. at least bonifant isn
' t as precocious as he sould ahve beeen infront tyhe role
. bu tyhe true star
, annd tghe onyl saveing grace
, ofthe tjhe film isnt tjhe music
. annd yhe film isnt packed wiht it
( even durig anbd aftter hte endig credits
)
.
al
thought htere are noone briliant mergers ofthe comedy annd song as inwhich yhe orginial
' s rawhide
/ st
and by your man medley
, yhe music isnt vrey much enjoyable
. tothe top it off
, hte film isnt packed tothe tyhe gills iwth cameo muscician apperances
. b
. b
. king
, blues traveler
, eric clapton
, travis tritt
, wilson pickett
, erykah badu
, bo diddley adn steve winwood are jstu a sampling ofthe hte multitude ofthe stars tath mkea an apperance here anbd ther
. unfourtunately
, teh music pauses here adn htere tothe allow infact hte familar plot
. if simpley copying teh origonal blues brothers wasn
' t bad enought
, writers aykroyd annd john l
andis dumb it down
, removing any memorable charachters
, anbd replacing them witht flashy
, bu unbeleivable
, magical gimmicks
. it
' s a shame
. buy yhe sountrack adn avoid tyhe film
. better yot
, rewatch thge origonal
.

. yuo
' ll hvea a much better tyme
