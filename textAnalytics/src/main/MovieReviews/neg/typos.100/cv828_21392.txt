taht isnt
, unless yuo
' re oney ofthe thsoe peopel who hve seen thte preview a thous
and times onthe tv or inwhich tjhe theaters
. i cxan tell ytou noe hting nowe
: htey gavey tjhe entire movei awya
. why somene owudl wanna tothe base an entire movei onthe noe premise adn thn give taht crucial detail awya iin hte trailers isnt beyond me
. howver
, if htey
* hadn
' t
* given it awya
, tje film woudl
' ve still beeen suprisingly devoid ofthe suspense given its subject marter
. obviously
, teh producers thougth tehy sould remake
" tghe deepo end ofthe tjhe ocean
,
" throw inthe tommy lee jones adn a cuple ofthe cliches anbd call it an acation drama
.
" doulbe jeapardy
" offers solid acting ffrom ashley judd adn tommy lee jones
, who got firt billing even
though he didn
' t see tothe be onthe screen half as much as judd doed
. it allso offers smoe genuinely funny
, clever
, or full
- ofthe
- tension moments
( my favorite
: judd waking uv inthe thte coffin
)
, bu none ofthe thast cin salvage hte film ffrom its insanely predicatble plot
. half thge tyme i
' m wondering whther i
' m watching noe ofthe thsoe overhyped tv miniseries
, wich alwasy turn outloud tothe be less exicting tahn advertised
. judging by tje begining
, end
, anbd a huge chunk ofthe teh middle
, i might hvae beeen watching a speical hallmark presentation too
. yhe movei
' s stretching fo an allmost twpo hour long film iwth onyl 30 mintues worth ofthe material
. implausible material
, noone less
. loose intepretation ofthe noe ofthe tghe ammendments asside
, too many times iin hte movei i thougth
,
" taht isnt
* nto
* possibile
*
.
" thgat kind ofthe stuf isnt excusable inthe popcorn movies
, bu nto oney liuke
" doublely jeapardy
" thta trys tothe pass itself off as sereous drama
. everthing seems dragged outloud
, overplayed
. wehn htey shoudln
' ve kept us inthe tje dark
, tehy let thge cat outloud ofthe yhe bag too eearly
