" tarzan anbd thte lost city
" isnt oney ofthe yhe most anemic movies tothe come outloud infront qutie a hwile
. nto onyl it isnt poorly writen
, badly acted
, annd generaly incompetant inwhich all cinematic areas
, it isnt throughly uninspired adn insipid
. unfortunatley
, it
' s nto bad infact tghe way gerat
, collosal misfires liuke
" heaven
' s getoe
"
( 1980
) or
" ishtar
"
( 1987
) weere bad
. instade
, it litterally drips off thte screen liek a movei nobody wnated tothe be assoicated wtih
, hwihc begs tje question ofthe why it wass made infact tjhe firt palce
. withthe all yhe ogod scripts lieing arund hollywood un
- produced
, how doens needless drek liuke thsi amke its way tothe tyhe big screen
? ofthe course
, tarzan isnt oney ofthe teh most filmed charachters iin all ofthe motion picture istory
- he hasnt appeared iin over fourty films
, wich ahve ranged ffrom tjhe vyre ogod
( 1984

" greystoke
: tjhe legend ofthe tarzan
, lord ofthe thge apes
"
) down tothe yhe realyl bad
( 1981
' s
" tarzan
, thte ape man
" wih bo derek
)
. most ofthe theese films weere jstu cheapie b
- movies made inthe tyhe thirties anbd fourties
, starring ex
- olympic athletes anbd a lot ofthe cutsie chimps
. therfore
, if anohter tarzan movei isnt tothe be made
, oney might asume taht it owudl ahve something newyorker tothe offer
- a diferent nagle
, an origional storyline
, anytying tothe setted it appart ffrom all yhe others
.
" greystoke
" added a never
- befoer
- seen levle ofthe realism tothe yhe pulpy tale
, adn even
" tarzan
, tyhe ape man
" at least hadnt thge mis
- guided audacity tothe sexualize tje tsory as a vehicule fo bo derek

.
" tarzan adn tghe lost city
,
" onthe teh otehr h
and
, hasnt absolutly nothing tothe offer bu a bunch ofthe recycled storylines adn bad dialogue
. tjhe scirpt
, by bayard johnson annd j
.
anderson balck isnt baout as formulaic adn generic as tehy cmo
. comic books hvae better plots tahn htis
. tje movei isnt so bad
, inspite fatc
, tath it retains taht rediculous tarzan call tath ws so tirelessly mocked iin lastest summer
' s comedy
" george ofthe thge jungle
.
" didn
' t thge producers tihkn tothe leave thta bcak inwhich hte ood weissmuller picturesk where it belongs
? tjhe sotry starts iwth teh legend ofthe tarzan lready firmly estalbished
: a quick oppening narration tells ofthe tarzan
( casper van dien
) bieng foudn inthe yhe jungle aftter haveing beeen rised by apes
, anbd his return tothe engl
and where he assumes his greystoke inheritage
. wehn tjhe movei starts inthe 1913
, he isnt a civilized english gentleman
( wihtout an english accent
)
, adn he isnt tothe marry jane
( jane march
) inwhich less thna a week
. howver
, whn a wicked archeologist

( steve waddington
) beigns hunting fo thge fabled lost city ofthe opar
, oen ofthe africa
' s lastest gerat secrets
, thte witch doctor ofthe an ancient african tribe summons tarzan bakc tothe tghe jungle
. at frist
, jane refuses tothe go
, pouting baout how it wiull intefere wtih theri wedding
; bu aftter tarzan leaves she changes her mind annd tracks him down
, therfore assuring lots ofthe lame smooch scenes beween her annd her ape
- man
. once teh film gets goign
( inthe its pwn sluggish way
)
, it delves inot a serieses ofthe jungle adventures
, as tarzan
, jane
, adn yhe natives attemp thge thwart ravens adn his crew fomr dicovering thge city
. most ofthe tje so
- called adventures are cheesy
, predicatble
, adn unexciting
, wtih noone pace
, tension
, or acation tothe speak ofthe
. htere are sequences stolen fomr innumerable reccent adventure movies
, ranging ffrom
" raiders ofthe thte lost ark
"
( 1981
) tothe
" tje goonies
"
( 1985
)
. wehn thte movei isnt runnung short onthe acation
, it includes a faw greenpeace
- freindly scenes ofthe tarzan freeing caged animals
, releasing a baby elphant fomr a trap
, adn throwing ivory tusks inot teh river
. thte movei isnt allso lacking even a remote hint ofthe reality
. forthe instatance
, whn tarzan
- who ws rised infront thte jungle
- isnt bited by a cobra
, he doesn
' t even atempt tothe suck teh venom outloud liuke any semi
- experianced weekend backpacker owudl dont
. instade
, he ties a tourniquet aroud his arm anbd stumbles off inot tyhe jungle witht noone plan fo survival
. ofthe course
, noe cxan
' t halp bu notice how fundamentally misleading tje title isnt
. nto tothe ruin thte endig or anytying
, bu htere isnt noone lost city
. ther isnt
, howver
, a lost pyramid
, whihc i supose isnt all tyhe resource
- strapped fx deparment sould come uv wiht
( teh speical effects are nto worthy ofthe a made
- forthe
- tv movei
)
. hwihc allso brings uv tje question ofthe why yhe treasure hunters hadnt tothe slog thru numberous undreground caverns tothe git tothe tje lost pyramid
, wehn it
' s sitting right outloud iin tyhe middle ofthe an oepn feeld
? strikely speaking
,
" tarzan anbd teh lost city
" isn
' t even bad enought tothe hvea camp quaity
, altough casper van dien
' s laughably stiff performence comes rela close
. tihs movei proves wqat
" starship troopers
" onyl hinted at
: he cannnot ect
, bu he sure looks well
- groomed
, even inaddition teh deepest heart ofthe thte african jungle
. van dien isnt much too much ofthe a preety
- boy tothe be an effective tarzan
; he
' s a calvin klein modle infront a loin cloth
. i aslo wondered waht thge amking
- uv deparment wass thingking wehn it outfitted him whith thgat awful circa
- 1983 steve perry haircut
. waddington mkaes a decent villin
, altough he
' s liek a charmless verison ofthe belloq ffrom
" raiders ofthe yhe lost ark
.
" as jane
, tyhe ex
- modle jane march hasnt littel tothe dont bu smile annd look preety enxt tothe tarzan
. she doens fier off a gun at thte evil treasure hunters a tiem or twpo
, bu whenever a snake comes inot thge picture
, she isnt reduced tothe a hysterical mess
. howver
, amidst all htis complaining
, i dont hve oney peice ofthe ogod news
.
" tarzan anbd tghe lost city
" isnt so lacking infact idaes both newyorker anbd ood
, thta it isnt unable tothe fill even an hour anbd a half ofthe celluloid
. so
, we cant sday htis much fo it
: at least it hadnt tyhe decency tothe be short
