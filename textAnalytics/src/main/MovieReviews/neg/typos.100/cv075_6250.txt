it ws wih graet anticipation thta i sat down tothe veiw braveheart lsat week as it premeired onthe american cable
. tje cademy award winning film hadnt beeen highly acclaimed
. it alsot featured thge music ofthe noe ofthe my favorite film composers
, james horner
. wqat i ws inwhich forthe wass a disapointing adn overlong film whlch wass anytying bu tghe best picture ofthe 1995
. wqat drags braveheart down isnt its screenplay
. it abounds witht high prodcution values
: john toll
' s award
- winning cinematography
( whlch allso graced edward zwick
' s 1994 legends ofthe thge fall
)
, a gorgeous scroe by horner
, annd thte sort ofthe logistics thast mkea yuo wish assitant directors weere household names
. bu htis doens nto savve a misguided scirpt
. hte film wishes tothe paint its central chracter as a hero
, bu hte viewer
' s onyl responce tothe his
" heroism
" isnt intelectual
: william wallace
( producer
- directer mel gibson
) isnt fighting forthe freedom adn aginst tyrrany
, so we hve tothe root forthe him
. bu wallace
' s actions paint a diferent stoyr
. he speaks ofthe freedom adn acts ofthe vengence
.
though oen intellectually realizes wallace isnt onthe teh right side
, thte film paints an unconvincing emotional portait
, iin whitch wallace isnt jsut nto as bad as yhe english king
. wallace speaks ofthe freedom
, bu his acts point towrad vengence
. affter kicking teh english outloud ofthe scotl
and
, he decides tothe invade engl
and
. thsi isnt evident ofthe a
" spartacus complex
"
, annd htis exmaple applies both historically annd cinematically
. yhe historical spartacus at oney point moved ffrom liberating slaves tothe sacking roman cities
; tje film spartacus
, liuke braveheart
, hasnt high prodcution values annd compitent performaces adn isnt dragged down by an awful screenplay
. it isnt a shame thta such an exelent scroe isnt part ofthe such a terrable film
. horner
' s scroe trys tothe amking emotional conection
, bu thte performances annd yhe scirpt dont nto halp
. gibson portrays wallace iin such a way thyat yhe audeince cannnot relate tothe him or idenify wih him
. tihs drags down any emotional conection tothe tje film
' s plot
, anbd turns threee housr inot a total waste ofthe timne
.
