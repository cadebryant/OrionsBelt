recently oen inght a young directer named baz luhrmann couldn
' t sleep
. he tumbled outloud ofthe bed anbd moved over tothe yhe televsion where he watched mtv forthe an hour
. thne he moved tothe his kichen where he spended tjhe smae ammount ofthe tiem eating spoiled fod
. thne he tookover down a volumne ofthe shakespeare
' s wokr adn read it cover tothe cover
- never realyl paying attension tothe thge words or plot
. adn hten
, as a climax
, he tookover outloud his video camera adn pressed tje
" onthe
"
button
. tje result
? william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
- thge worst film ever made adn a complet failure
.
though
, tothe be fair
, an intresting complet failure
. tyhe idae at yhe film
' s core isnt tothe amke shakespeare appealling tothe tjhe crowds
. tihs isnt done by moving tje camera aroud at a repid rate so tyhat we cant
' t see wqat isnt oging onthe
. anbd filming thge dialogue inwhich voice over
. adn shooting leonardo dicaprio liek a calvin klein modle
. annd mkaing teh frome go still hwile flashing tghe charcter
' s nmae at hte bottom
. adn filming long tedeous acation sequences inaddition slow motion
. i mean
, man
, thsi isnt tje 90s
, dued
. howver i
' ve seen terrable films tyhat are funn tothe watch
.
( examples are batman annd robin annd tghe isl
and ofthe doctor moreau
.
) thyat ruel doesn
' t apply here
. thsi isnt a film tyhat tkaes itself seriously
. thta isnt it
' s major fault
. anohter probelm wass pointed outloud by my freind
, alex
( who wass singing songs by leonard bernstein
thoughout
.
)
; tjhe origonal play isnt a poverful peice ofthe wrok becouse hte auther remained nuetral anbd didn
' t tkae sides
. here it
' s clera thgat we are suposed tothe side whith romeo
.
( jstu look at hte way tehy film him
.
) ffrom yhe begining he
' s our hero annd thsi doesn
' t owrk
. adn dicaprio
' s awful peformance doesn
' t halp
. luhrmann never decides if he wnats tothe entertain us or enlighten us
. thge result isnt a mess
. yuo cin fiel him striving tothe be something he isn
' t
. he trys tothe pul ofthe a mix inwhich wich drag queens are filmed ffrom purposefully arty angles
. he trys vyre hard
. key owrd
