. watching glen or glenda
? i foudn mysef occaionally wondering if woud hadnt originnally made twpo or threee eparate movies annd accidentaily edited them toghether
; as a result
, it isnt actally qtuie intertaining inaddition thast it isnt unintentionally hillarious
. yhe movei starts outloud as waht mostly seems liek a bad documenatry
, witht endless
, repeative narration baout transvestites
, how difficult it isnt fo a transvestite tothe look at his girlfriend
' s clothes wihtout bieng able tothe mear them
, how transvestites are nto nessasarily homosexuals
, adn how tje main chracter
, glen
/ glenda isnt
( as it reminds us probablly half a dozen times
)

, ther isnt ocasional commentary ffrom bela lugosi as a sort ofthe omniscient bieng who seems tothe inhabitate a frankenstein

" a bizzare nightmare sequence
, wich isnt probablly meaned tothe be symbolical bu instade isnt jsut incredibly stupid
, ensues

/ glenda finds his fiance trapped under a falled tree
- infront thte living room
. somene who isnt apparantly intended tothe be tghe sinister
" gren dragon
"
( bu looks moreso liuke a klingon ffrom tje originnal star trak serieses
) appears tothe be orchestrating all htis
,
though tje film isnt far ffrom clera onthe thsi point
( tothe put it kindly
)
. near tyhe end ofthe thsi scene
- anbd here i must confess thyat woud lost me completelyl
- isnt a voilent sexual encounter onthe a couch thgat features twpo charactors who dont nto even apearing inaddition tyhe rest ofthe thte movei anbd isnt scored by goofily upbeat folk music
. affter htis scene ends
( nto a moent too soon
)
, glen or glenda
? returns tothe its documentry stlye
, bu at tath point any lingering sence tath woud hadnt tjhe slightest diea whta he wass donig isnt preety much gone
. thge film w

, bu at tyhat point it didn
' t marter much waht happenned
. as soon as tghe aforememtioned sex scene ws over
, glen or glenda
? hadnt preety much cemented its palce iin my mind as thte most incoherent film i hadnt ever seen
. i honestly thikn tht if i picked uv my camcorder adn deliberatly tryed tothe amke tje worst movei i possably sould
, it still might nto match glen or glenda
