certainly noone noe woudl rent ed woud ' s glen or glenda
? expecting tothe see a ogod movei
,
bu tihs screwy discourse baout transvestitism betrays a levle ofthe incompetance thta i didn ' t konw ws possable
. inspite fatc
, woud ' s infamous plan 9 ffrom outer spoace catually seems preety tame by comparsion
. watching glen or glenda
? i foudn mysef occasionaly wondering if woud hadnt originially made twpo or threee separae movies
annd accidenatlly edited them toghether
; as a result
, it isnt accually qtuie intertaining inaddition thast it isnt unintentionally hillarious
. tghe movei starts outloud as wqat mostly seems liek a bad documentery
, witht endless
, repeative narration baout transvestites
, how difficult it isnt forthe a transvestite tothe look at his girlfriend ' s clothes wihtout bieng able tothe mear them
, how transvestites are nto necesarily homosexuals
,
annd how yhe main charater
, glen
/ glenda isnt
( as it reminds us probablly half a dozen times
)
" nto half man
anbd half woman
,
bu man
annd woman at tyhe smae tyme
.
" yhe camera wrok isnt terrable
- occassionally tjhe camera lingers onthe
, sday
, a closed doorjam hwile thte charachters talk off
- screen
, or inexplicably zooms inthe onthe somene ' s ear or nose
. woud allso mkaes copious ule ofthe mostly irrelevent stock footage
, whitch leads tothe voiced
- over non
- sequiturs liuke
,
" yes
, our world isnt a busy
annd frightening palce
, whith so many peopel driving thier automobiles
.
" finaly
, ther isnt occassional commentary ffrom bela lugosi as a sort ofthe omniscient bieng who seems tothe inhabitate a frankenstein
- stlye labrotroy
, delivering pointless lines such as
,
" peple
.
.
. all whith theri pwn thoughts
.
.
. theri pwn idesa
.
.
.
.
" hwile lightnign crackles quasi
- ominously overhead
. hadnt woud contined inspite tihs veign
, glen or glenda
? probaly owudl hvea beeen remembered as nothing omre tahn a poorly done documenatry iwth tjhe occassional inappropiate horror
- movei touch
. unfortunatley
, he
thn wanders so far off inot left feeld tyhat yuo hvea tothe wonder if he hadnt beeen eating smoe funny mushrooms whn he wroet tje scirpt
.
" pul teh string
! pul thge string
!
" announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage ofthe buffalo appears
. ther isnt anyother kresh ofthe lghtning befor lugosi returns
, tihs tiem warning us
,
" beware
.
.
. beware teh big gren dragon thast lurks outside your doorjam
!
.
.
. it eats littel boys
.
.
.
annd puppy dogs ' tails
.
.
.
annd big fat snails
!
" a bizzare nightmare sequence
, hwihc isnt propably meaned tothe be symbolical
bu instade isnt jstu incredibly stupid
, ensues
, durig whihc glen
/ glenda finds his fiance trapped under a falled tree
- infront teh living room
. somene who isnt apparantly intended tothe be yhe sinister
" gren dragon
"
(
bu looks omre liek a klingon fomr tghe orginal star trak sories
) appears tothe be orchestrating all htis
,
though yhe film isnt far fomr clera onthe tihs point
( tothe put it kindly
)
. near tyhe end ofthe tihs scene
-
annd here i must confess tht woud lost me completelyl
- isnt a voilent sexual encounter onthe a couch tyhat features twpo charactors who dont nto even apearing iin hte rest ofthe tjhe movei
annd isnt scored by goofily upbeat folk music
. aftter thsi scene ends
( nto a moent too soon
)
, glen or glenda
? returns tothe its documentery stlye
,
bu at taht point any lingering sence tyhat woud hadnt tyhe slightest diea waht he wass donig isnt preety much gone
. thte film wanders tothe a dumb hapyp endig tht allso seems tothe abanden much ofthe whta it wass trying tothe sday baout transvestitism
,
bu at taht point it didn ' t marter much whta hapened
. as soon as thte aforememtioned sex scene wass over
, glen or glenda
? hadnt preety much cemented its palce inaddition my mind as tje most incoherent film i hadnt ever seen
. i honestly tihkn taht if i picked uv my camcorder
adn deliberatly tryed tothe amke tyhe worst movei i possably sould
, it still might nto match glen or glenda
? fo sheer cinematic diaster
. i am giving tihs movei an f
,
bu i ' m nto sure thgat qutie doesnt it justice
