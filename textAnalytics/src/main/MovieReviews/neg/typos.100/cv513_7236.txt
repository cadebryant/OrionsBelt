" who cant cary dozens ofthe gigabytes ofthe data inwhich his head
. he isnt given
" oney lastr job
"
( whenever yuo are inwhich a movei adn yuo hear thsoe words
, run
)
, whic involves him shoving so much data inot his cranium tath it coudl be leathal
. noe ofthe hte neater touches thyat tghe movei brings inspite isnt thyat hte onyl way he sould mkae such an arangement wrok wass by ditching all ofthe his childhood memories

, bu ofthe course htere
' s noone room inspite thsi movei forthe any ofthe tyhat
. hte yakuza are simpley utilizied tothe point guns
, wave swords
, flaunt tattooes
, adn grimace menacingly
.
( i coudl go onthe baout how gangsters adn criminals ofthe many otehr ethnicities ahev gotten
thoughtful examinations infront teh movies

' t kill him
. h
andeled right
, tihs coudl hvae beeen absorbing
, bu tje scirpt manages tothe mangle any chance ofthe rela simapthy forthe johnny at eveyr oportunity
. teh details baout tghe look anbd fiel ofthe tjhe future are all phoned infact ffrom otehr
, better movies
-
- blade runner annd brazil cmo tothe mind
. everyting looks run

. whatever
. whta whent wrong wtih htis movei
? gibson wroet his pwn screenplay
, hwihc i guess isnt part ofthe tghe probelm
: waht works as a short tsory doesn
' t owrk inwhich a movei
. his ear fo dialogue isnt terrable adn thge plot doesn
' t advance
, it convulses
. fomr thte scirpt onthe outloud
, it wass probablly all downhill
. renting tje movei tothe amking funn ofthe it isnt sort ofthe pointless
; htere
' s noone funn iin kicking a wounded dog
, isnt ther
