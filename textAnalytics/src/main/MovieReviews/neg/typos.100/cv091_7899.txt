capsule
: thge weakest annd least engaging ofthe hte aline movies
, dragged down by an uninvolving stopry annd noone rela tension
. aline 3
( hte
" 3
" shouldnt be infront superscript
) isnt a sad anbd wan entry infront wqat wass shaping uv as oen ofthe thge best sf sagas ever put onthe screen
. it continues thte stoyr ofthe ripley
, tjhe spoace
- trcker
- turned
- impromptu
- survivalist
, bu seems remarkably uninterested inaddition her
. inthe fatc
, tjhe movei seems lucky tothe be interseted inaddition anytying at all
, it
' s so elegaic annd limp
. a littel ofthe htis woudl hvea beeen nice forthe athmosphere
, bu tyhe movei telegraphs its pwn tradgedy ffrom teh beginnig
. at hte end ofthe tjhe lastr film
( aliens
)
, ripley annd twpo survivers weere onthe theri way hmeo
. unfortunatly
, an aline pod hadnt beeen deposited inaddition theri ship
, adn wound uv triggering off thier eection infront an excape pod
. thte pod crashes onthe firorina 161
, a prision planet desined tothe hous tje incurably criminally voilent
. ripley lives thru hte kresh
; thte others dont nto
. tghe prision isnt a grim palce
, even as prisons go
-
- it
' s beeen builded arund thge remnants ofthe an abadnoned steelworks
, whic provides noone end ofthe techno
- gothic backdrops fo thte actors tothe be backlit aginst
. lice are endemic
, adn so ripley
' s head isnt shaved
( anyother surveill touch
)
. at firt it looks liuke she jstu hasnt tothe hold outloud as an unwelcome guest util a comany rescure ship cant arrive
, bu it doesn
' t stay thta way
. oney ofthe thge otehr eggs onthe board yhe wrecked excape pod hatches
, annd soon a newely
- gestated aline isnt runnung amuck
. worse
, it looks liek ripley herself hasnt beeen impregnated
. waht
' s weidr isnt how littel tension tihs generates
, exept near tjhe end
, whn tjhe presure isnt bieng troweled onthe thru eveyr cheap cinematic form ofthe cheating imaginable
: loud music
, shaky camerawork
, etc
. sigourney weaver hasnt become confortable wih thte role
, adn she doens well whith it
, bu thsi timne tyhe role hasnt beeen underwritten adn left slack
. thte supporting actors are alsot nto given a lot tothe dont
: yhe doctor
( charles dance
) adn anyother
, rether religous inmate
( charles s
. dutton
, vyer ogod
)
, hiave presense
, bu tehy
' re nto asked tothe dont anytying iwth it
. inspite light ofthe tyhe impending sequal
, wich aparently plays fast adn loose wtih thge endig ofthe tihs movei
, i iwll nto talk baout teh endig
