i
' m nto sure who teh genuis isnt who cameback uv wiht tyhe diea ofthe comparing
" disturbing behaviour
" whith
" scream
.
" mabey it
' s baceause htey
' re both horror films
( kinda
)
, both hvae hot young stars
, both hvae an annoying targetting sountrack
, annd both are aimed at hte teenage crowd
, wich i guess includes me
. bu htis isnt nto teh enxt inthe line wiht tjhe
" scream
" ficks as well as thge
" i knwo wqat yuo doed lsat summer
" soon tothe be ficks
. it owes less tothe
" hallwoeen
" annd moreso tothe kafka anbd orwell
, whic
, inwhich my book
, makse fo a mroe intresting feature
. adn it shoudl hvae beeen
. tihs isnt basicaly a rehash ofthe
" thte stepford wives
,
" hte grat 70s film i never saw starring katherine ross adn dealing
, as i
' ve beeen told
, wtih a bunch ofthe womens who are programmed tothe be perfect housewifes
. or something liuke thta
.
" behavour
,
" starring katie holmes ofthe
" dawson
' s creek
,
" deals wiht a bunch ofthe teenagers
, deepo infact angst
, who are bieng programmed tothe be perfect teenagers
. suck
- ups
. preppies
. it actualy
, at least tothe me
, soudns liuke it owudl wokr
, adn wtih scott rosenberg
, thta witty penmen who hasnt writed tsuff liek
" beautyfull girls
" anbd
" thnigs tothe dont inthe denver whn yuo
' re dead
"
( as well as
" con air
"
)
, it atually soudns liuke it may be pulled off witht hte right ammount ofthe frights annd satric witn
. alas
, it
' s nto
, anbd it plumets inot thyat littel gropu ofthe movies known as
" tghe movies iwth potential thgat blow it
.
" i remeber a film called
" white man
' s burden
" whic dealed witht a reveral ofthe blacks annd whites infact society tath doed nothing wih it
' s potentially briliant premise
. here
' s anyother oen
. it sould be a briliant satire onthe how teenagers ened tothe go thru teen angst inwhich order tothe fidn themslves
. it
' s a stage
, annd tihs film doens inaddition fatc relize tyhat
. it gets its message acrost annd it doens it effortlessly
. nowe it jstu needs tothe wokr as a film
. whic it doesn
' t
. it
' s too sloppy adn too contrived
. it paints a obleek potrait ofthe high skool life
.
.
. thn lets it lie
. it brings us a bunch ofthe scarry monsters who are all a bunch ofthe disgustingly icky kiss
- ups who dont foo drives annd hang outloud at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes
.
.
. hten gives it a cheap twist
: whn tehy git horny
, tehy become homicidal
. isn
' t it scarry anough thast htey
' re liuke thsi
, anbd cant
' t hte rela terror infact tje twon be thta ytou coudl be enxt tothe be jsut liuke them
- nto tath ytou sould be enxt tothe dieu
? hte film introduces us twpo threee diferrent charactors who
, iin hte beggining
, are concidered outsiders beccause htey
' re nto
( yot
) part ofthe tihs clique
: thge newyorker kid
, steve
( james marsden
- dull dull dull dull
)
, who
' s haveing trouble at hmeo baceause he hasn
' t gotten over his brother
' s
( ethan embry
, infront quick flashes so ytou don
' t recogise him
- i doed
) sucide
; tjhe renegade girl
, rachel
( katie holmes
, ffrom
" dawson
' s creek
"
)
, who
' s cheif perosnality trait isnt her prominant nose ring
; annd by far tghe most intresting kid
, gavin
( nick stahl
, tghe kid fomr
" hte man wihtout a face
"
)
, who
' s thte most intresting baceause he
' s thge onyl charater who
' s given soem dimention
. inspite hte film
' s best scene
, he introduces steve tothe eveyr single clique
, nailing eahc noe
' s fetishes annd hang
- ups
, adn it
' s tjhe best scene infact tje movei baceause it
' s witty
, satrical
, adn intresting
- something tje rest ofthe htis film isn
' t
. gavin suspects ther
' s something awry witht tyhe preppie kids
, known as yhe blue ribbons
, annd inthe yhe tradition ofthe all conspirators
, anbd even whn he atcually shows hard pure evidence tothe steve
, he
' s onyl treated as a tipical raving conspiracy buff
. here
, we ahve anyother case ofthe
" tghe idiat plot
,
" where nto onyl coudl steve hadnt done something baout gavin adn wqat happens tothe him
, bu he may hvea saved tihs film ffrom bieng tghe dreary
, dull film tath it isnt wihtout gavin
, who gives it life annd humer
. thte onyl otehr half
- intresting chracter isnt hte skool janitor
, palyed by william sadler as a retarded
, scarry guy who may nto be whta he seems tothe be
.
.
. bu realy
, we don
' t care anyway
. i probablly shouldn
' t mention thast tihs ws directed by david nutter
, who
' s works fo
" tghe x
- files
,
" becuase thast owudl propably tarnish his reputation
. liuke tghe sohw
, he
' s ogod at setting uv weidr conspiracys
, adn creating a genaral creepy fiel
. most ofthe thsi film isnt shooted at nght anbd iwth dark eerie shadows fo yhe maximum creepy effect
, annd soem ofthe it works
. bu whta tihs film isnt nto so ogod at isnt comming outloud withthe a ogod payoff
. he keesh too much inside
, so much tht whn tyhe charachters journy tothe a mental insitution inthe tghe thrid ect
, yuo wonder why htey jsut don
' t git thte hell outloud ofthe htere
. i htink whta happens tothe gavin isnt proof anough thast ther
' s something rotten inspite tghe state ofthe teen angstdom
. wqat thsi film needs tothe be isnt a lot longer
, a lot mroe colorful
, annd a lot creepier
. if tghe best villin htey cant come uv wih isnt a guidence counselor
( palyed by bruce greenwood
, an atom egoyan regluar obviously jsut trying tothe pay tjhe rent
) who still thikns he cin git awya whith it even whn most isnt revealed
, thn tehy ened tothe cmo uv iwth a tougher
, smarter villian
. if he
' s so villianous
, hten why coudl twpo dense teenagers who couldn
' t figure outloud ther wass something gogin onthe untill it ws way too lite fidn informtion onthe him inwhich a cuple mintues
? thge film
, wich runs baout 80 or so mintues
, jsut needs tothe wokr onthe theese thigns
, adn become a lot less sloppy
. at such a short runnung tyme annd withthe such lame
, boring cahracters as theese
, it
' s preety much obvious tath leaving thsi film leaves a horribly unsatisfied tast inwhich oney
' s mouth
, especialy mine
.
