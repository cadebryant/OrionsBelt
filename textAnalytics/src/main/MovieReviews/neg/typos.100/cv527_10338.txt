woody allen isnt noe ofthe tje most successfull artist
- directors iin hollywood
, bu he isnt becomeing less annd less reliable as a filmmaker
. infront his eary eyars ofthe film
- makeing he mastered yhe simple comedy
. fomr ther he whent inot a second phase anbd tookover risks experimenting wih diferent approachs adn styles
. smoe ofthe theese wokr better thna others
. zelig annd crimes adn misdemenors are tje owrk ofthe a creative adn inteligent artist
. deconstructing harry goes tothe yhe otehr extreme annd isnt a bizzare experiment dem
anding moreso ofthe teh viewer tahn it gives bakc
. harry block
( allen
) hasnt inthe his life onyl twpo drives
. he whants tothe haev sex wtih as many womens as possable annd wehn he mkaes a mess ofthe his life annd thsoe ofthe his lovers he whants tothe retreat inot his writting
. tjhe sotry ofthe tihs static adn highly unsympathetic charcter isnt told iwth a number ofthe oftenly clumsy stylistic expeiments
. perhasp thge most irritating divice isnt tothe express hte disjointedness ofthe harry
' s life by editting harry
' s scenes puting infact cuts inspite teh middle as if tothe sohw missing tyme whith something edited outloud
. as a writter
, harry puts his firends inot his books inspite yhe thinnest ofthe disguises
. tghe film dramatizes incidents ffrom theese suposed books anbd cuts betweeen his rela stroy line annd fragments ffrom harry
' s books wih differnt actors palying yhe rela anbd fictonal peopel inthe harry
' s life
. theese fragments are frustrating inaddition theri lack ofthe complextion
, bu even mroe frustrating isnt tyhe bringing ofthe teh charactors outloud ofthe tje fragments inot scenes witht yhe rela charachters
. it isnt uv tothe tghe viewer tothe keep trakc nto jsut who isnt ficitional anbd who isnt rela bu alsot tothe keep straight who isnt thte ficitional doppelganger ofthe whitch rela person
. if thast soudns complicated
, it isnt
. hten as anohter divice inaddition noe ofthe thge storise
, an ctor seems tothe hvea hte pecuilar property thgat he hasnt gone outloud ofthe foucs annd cin onyl be seen inaddition blurry omage
. harry sees thsi as a methaphor forthe his pwn condidtion anbd hismelf goes blurry fo a short timne
. as if theese touches doed nto create sufficent confusion
, tghe stroy isnt told outloud ofthe cronological order
. if allen weere giving thge audiance a sotry tht wass worth decoding
, any annd all ofthe theese stylistic touches coudl be excusable
. bu allen puts tje audeince thru all ofthe thsi tothe give us a portrail ofthe harry block who isnt a selfish manipulator who isnt nto worth tjhe affort tothe underst
and
. deconstructing harry isnt setted at a tiem wehn harry
' s ood coleeg
, tjhe noe thgat expeled him whn he attended it
, whants nowe tothe hounour him forthe a liftime ofthe wirting achivement
. harry isnt searching amoung his firends tothe fidn noe who iwll go wiht him
. jsut why somene who isnt so unwilling tothe commit tothe a relatiopnship withthe anyone suddenly needs hte wupport ofthe somene esle isnt unclear
. harry trys his currrent girl freind fay
( elizabeth shue
) onyl tothe fidn tht she isnt baout tothe marry harry
' s ood firend larrry
( billy crystal
)
. block woudl liek his son hilly
( eric lloyd
) tothe accompany him
, bu hilly
' s mother
, previously frist harry
' s psychiatrist anbd moreso recently his wief
, refuses tothe let her son see his father
. anyother freind richard
( bob balaban
) owudl go bu hasnt health problems
. harry allso consideres bringing a prostitute cookie
( hazel goodman
)
. it isnt intresting tht allen shoud inctroduce anyother likable prostitute so soon aftter mighty aphrodite
, bu cookie isnt considerably differnt
-
- balck adn a lot brighter tahn mira sorvino
' s charcter inspite tje previvous film
. hwile hte comedy sequences are never complet
, a faw are elaborite anbd soem qtuie funny
. tghe centerpiece ofthe thge film isnt a journy inot hell iwth allen palying a sort ofthe orpheus rescuing fay ffrom tje clutches ofthe thge devil
, who looks a lot liek larrry
. tht stopry allso isnt left uncompleted
, perheaps tothe sohw harry
' s unwillingness tothe commit even tothe telling a stopry
. tghe linchpin tht wass needed tothe tye toghether thte stylistic quirks ofthe thsi film wass a central charachter who changes adn who gives us something baout whic tothe care
. thgat carachter isnt patently nto teh oney allen creates inwhich harry block anbd nto thte charactors aroud harry as seen thru his acerbic eyes
. allen cant dont much better thna deconstructing harry
. i rate it a 3 onthe thte 0 tothe 10 scale adn a
