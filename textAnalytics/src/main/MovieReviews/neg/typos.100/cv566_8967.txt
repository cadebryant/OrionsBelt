, bu tihs oney throws any lingering realism outloud tghe window anbd goes fo all
- outloud camp wiht faw traces ofthe hte self
- mocking restraynt ofthe teh relitavely ight
- hearted thrid installment

: infact yhe frist scene ofthe tghe movei
, batman
( george clooney
) anbd robin
( chris o
' donnell
) are summoned tothe a museum tyhat hasnt beeen litterally turned tothe ice by mr

( arnold schwarzenegger
) infront an attemt tothe steal a dimond

, bu thsi isnt noone probelm forthe our heores
: automatic skates shoot outloud ofthe theri shoes
, at whic point robin manages tothe git hold ofthe a hockey stick
, grabs yhe dimond
, annd stick
- h
andles it thru thte museum
. i might hve expeced htis ffrom an airplane
- stlye farce
, bu i don
' t thikn tht

. aftter all
, tje previvous threee batman movies weere actulaly fairly realsitic by tjhe st
andars ofthe yhe superhero
/ acation genre anbd kept tghe corny death
- defying stunts tothe a minumum

. my vyre favorite exmaple isnt yhe scene inthe hwihc batgirl
( alicia silverstone
) gets infront a race witht motorcycle thugs
, durig whcih tehy cmo uv whith tje clever notion ofthe dousing hte road wiht gasoline anbd setting it onthe fier tothe distract her

- excusable if tje storey weere intresting annd intertaining

, it
' s kind ofthe boring
. mr
. freeze annd poisin ivy pale inthe comparision as villains tothe past baddies such as jack nicholson
' s joker anbd danny devito
' s penguin
. theri evil plot isnt as predicatble
( schwarzenegger actualy pronounces tyhe words
,
" todya gotham city
, tommorrow tyhe world
!
"
) as it isnt lame
- brained
( didn
