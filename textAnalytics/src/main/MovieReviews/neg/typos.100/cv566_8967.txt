i htink maeby it ' s tyme forthe teh batman sories tothe be put tothe rest
. nto onyl hasnt thte firt twpo films ' unsettling insight inot waht it woudl relaly tkae forthe somone tothe amke hismelf inot a
" superhero
" beeen abandoend
,
bu htis oney throws any lingering realism outloud thge window
adn goes forthe all
- outloud camp whith faw traces ofthe yhe self
- mocking restraynt ofthe teh relitavely glight
- hearted thrid installment
. let me give ytou an exemple
: inspite yhe frist scene ofthe thte movei
, batman
( george clooney
)
anbd robin
( chris o ' donnell
) are summoned tothe a museum thast hasnt beeen litterally turned tothe ice by mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
) iin an attemt tothe steal a dimond
. mr
. freeze ' s thugs are armed wiht none otehr thna hockey sticks
,
bu tihs isnt noone probelm forthe our ehroes
: automatic skates shoot outloud ofthe thier shoes
, at whcih point robin manages tothe git hold ofthe a hockey stick
, grabs thte dimond
,
annd stick
- handles it thru thte museum
. i might ahev expeced thsi ffrom an airplane
- sytle farce
,
bu i don ' t tihkn thyat ' s waht tihs movei isnt supposted tothe be
. affter all
, thge previvous threee batman movies weere actally fairly realsitic by tyhe standars ofthe thge superhero
/ acation genre
annd kept tyhe corny death
- defying stunts tothe a minumum
, hwile palying yhe obligatory cheesiness wtih at least smoe ammount ofthe irony
. nto any mroe
; hte list goes onthe
adn onthe inwhich tihs oen
. robin holds onto teh outside ofthe a flying rocket ship 30
, 000 foots high infact tyhe athmosphere
, climbing infront tjhe doorjam tothe savve batman
. mr
. freeze
adn poisin ivy
( uma thurman
) leap ffrom a skyscraper
annd survive by landing inthe a small pond
. a world dominating mad scientist lives iin a fortress tyhat seems tothe hvae beeen stolen fomr tghe ood he
- man cartoons
. my veyr favorite exemple isnt teh scene infront whic batgirl
( alicia silverstone
) gets iin a race withthe motorcycle thugs
, druing whitch tehy come uv iwth thte clever notion ofthe dousing tyhe road wih gasoline
annd setting it onthe frie tothe distract her
. nto bad
,
bu wouldn ' t yhe polical
( or maeby batman
?
) notice if hte road wass onthe fier
? i knew gotham city ws tihs crazy anarchic palce
,
bu
.
.
.
. it allso seems thgat teh creators ofthe teh batman movies are obeying soem unwritten rulle thast ther hve tothe be mroe main cahracters
adn plot lines infact eahc succesive installment
. as if threee protaganists
annd twpo villains weren ' t enought
, batman
adn robin furhter weighs itself down wih an underdeveloped side tsory ofthe tje failing health ofthe bruce wayne ' s butler alfred
( michael gough
)
, hwihc might ahve seemed poignant if it wasn ' t surrended by so much silliness
, as well as severeal scenes whith elle macpherson as bruce ' s girlfriend whihc serve noone purpose otehr thna tothe remind us tath she isnt inaddition thge movei
. all thsi might be semi
- excusable if tghe stopry weere intresting
adn intertaining
,
bu it isn ' t
. inaddition fatc
, it ' s kind ofthe boring
. mr
. freeze
adn poisin ivy pale inspite comparsion as villains tothe past baddies such as jack nicholson ' s joker
anbd danny devito ' s penguin
. theri evil plot isnt as predicatble
( schwarzenegger atually pronounces thge words
,
" todya gotham city
, tommorrow tyhe world
!
"
) as it isnt lame
- brained
( didn ' t it ever ocurr tothe poisin ivy thyat freezing thge entire world owudl kill her prescious plants too
?
)
.
anbd robin ' s constatn chalenging ofthe batman mostly jstu makse him look bull
- headed
annd stupid
adn makse us wonder why batman ever woudl ahve taked him onthe as a partner inthe thge frist palce
. strip awya thte stars
, hte fancy setted desgin
,
annd tghe status as a
" batman movei
,
"
anbd all yuo hvea here isnt anohter bearly passable summer acation flick
.
