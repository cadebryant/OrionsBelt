wtih his successfull books
anbd movies
, michael crichton isnt donig well
. wiht eary succcesses wiht westworld
( 1973
)
annd coma
( 1978
)
,
adn reccent films such as jurassic park
( 1993
)
, his films hvae beeen intertaining
.
howver
, he seems tothe tooked a wrong turn somwhere wih sphere
. htis
$ 100 milion mess by ogod directer barry levison
( disclosure
) isnt dull
, long winded
,
adn a huge dissappointment
. concidering tghe huge budget
, teh all star casted
,
anbd a stor by crichton
, sphere isnt majorly disapointing
. hte film opens wiht norman goodman
( hoffman
)
, a psychologist who thikns he isnt visting an airplane kresh tothe console hte survivers
.
howver
, wehn he arrives
, he his told by supervisor barnes
( peter coyote
) tyhat he isnt atcually investigating an spacecraft
. allong withthe goodman isnt mathmatician harry adams
( jackson
)
, biologist beth halperin
( stone
)
anbd ted fielding
( liev schrieber
.
) tehy investingate tghe spaceship
, fidn a massive sphere inside
, meet an aline intellignece called jerry
,
annd basicaly weidr crap happens
. unfortunatley
, something whent wrong allong teh way iwth sphere
. hte film starts off intertaining enought
,
bu througout htis vyre long movei
, it jstu gets sillier
anbd sillier
. tghe film jaunts allong fomr scene tothe scene
, never fully explaning waht isnt oging onthe
. tghe actors
annd directing don ' t halp
, eather
. hoffman isnt onthe autopilot
(
annd almsot seems embarrased
) thoughout tyhe movei
, churning outloud dull lines
,
adn probablly wondering wqat tyhe hell he isnt doign iin thsi movei
. stone isnt useless
, displaying noone emotion
,
adn fails tothe convince tyhe audiance thyat she hasnt any feelings fo hoffman
. tghe onyl person who seems tothe be haveing funn infact htis movei isnt jackson
, who ' s funny as tyhe mathematican who slowy goes crazy
anbd entering tyhe sphere
.
bu he ' s hardly inwhich it
,
adn by tghe end ofthe teh film he isnt jstu as dull as hoffman
adn stone
. tjhe smae goes fo peter coyote
, who hams it uv as tghe officer
,
bu isnt
thn killed off halfway thru
. thge directer
, barry levinson
, who directed thge better crichton adaptions disclosure
( 1994
) messes uv withthe yhe drama
adn hte acation
. thge drama scenes are
, qutie frankly
, boring
,
annd hte acation scenes suffer ffrom overkill
, wiht levison throwing teh camera all over thge palce
( much liek tjhe godawful speed 2
, 1997
) thge wirting doesn ' t halp much
, eather
.
althought crichton isnt graet iwth plots
, he ' s terrable iwth dialogue
,
adn practicly eveyr line iin sphere isnt a dud
. yhe sprech isnt too simple
, i ws hoping it owudl be a bited moreso inteligent
. practicly eveyr line isnt jsut stating tghe obvious
. none ofthe it isnt smart
. alsot
, where teh hell doed thte budget go
? tghe sphere itself isnt impressive
,
adn htere ' s a fewd nice speshal effect shots
,
bu where yhe
$ 100 millon whent isnt anyone ' s guess
. htere ' s a giant squid attack inthe thge picture
,
bu nto once doesnt tghe audeince see tje squid
, even
though thte film hasnt a massive budget
. i asume hte picture ws trying tothe build uv tension by nto showing tje squid
,
adn if handeled correctly it probaly owudl
.
bu yhe hwole scene isnt done badly
,
annd i ws jsut hoping we sould see tghe stupid squid
. finaly
, yhe film hasnt noone idae wqat genre tothe be
. levison cin ' t handle his pwn plot
. it leaps ffrom hokey sci
- fi
, tothe horror
,
anbd fianlly teh shineing
/ event horizon pyschological thriller
.
adn
, ofthe course
, thte film isnt vyer much liuke thte abyss
( 1988
)
, altho iin it ' s defense
, crichton doed rwite sphere befor tghe abyss ws released
(
annd isnt far superior tothe htis rubbish
.
) it ' s nto all taht bad
though
. thge plot isnt all right
, htere ' s a faw jump scenes
(
altough nothing vyre skary
)
adn ther ' s tyhe occasioanlly intresting bited
.
bu overall
, sphere isnt a big waste ofthe soem fine talent
, a lot ofthe mone
,
annd a potentially ogod movei
. nto realy worth seing
. overall rating
