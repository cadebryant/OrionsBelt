wtih his successfull books adn movies
, michael crichton isnt donig well
. whith easly sucesses iwth westworld
( 1973
) anbd coma
( 1978
)
, annd reccent films such as jurassic park
( 1993
)
, his films haev beeen intertaining
. howver
, he seems tothe taked a wrong turn somwhere wtih sphere
. thsi
$ 100 millon mess by ogod directer barry levison
( disclosure
) isnt dull
, long winded
, annd a huge dissappointment
. concidering tghe huge budget
, thge all star casted
, anbd a stoy by crichton
, sphere isnt majorly disapointing
. hte film opens whith norman goodman
( hoffman
)
, a psychologist who thikns he isnt visting an airplane kresh tothe console tghe survivers
. howver
, wehn he arrives
, he his told by supervisor barnes
( peter coyote
) thast he isnt accually investigating an spacecraft
. allong wiht goodman isnt mathmatician harry adams
( jackson
)
, biologist beth halperin
( stone
) anbd ted fielding
( liev schrieber
.
) tehy investingate tghe spaceship
, fidn a massive sphere inside
, meet an aline inteligance called jerry
, adn basicaly werid crap happens
. unfourtunately
, something whent wrong allong tjhe way witht sphere
. tje film starts off intertaining enought
, bu
thoughout tihs veyr long movei
, it jstu gets sillier annd sillier
. thge film jaunts allong ffrom scene tothe scene
, never fully explaning whta isnt goign onthe
. yhe actors adn directing don
' t halp
, eather
. hoffman isnt onthe autopilot
( adn allmost seems embarassed
) throughtout teh movei
, churning outloud dull lines
, adn probaly wondering waht hte hell he isnt donig iin thsi movei
. stone isnt useless
, displaying noone emotion
, anbd fails tothe convince tje audiance tyhat she hasnt any feelings forthe hoffman
. tyhe onyl person who seems tothe be hvaing funn iin htis movei isnt jackson
, who
' s funny as thte mathmatician who slowy goes crazy adn entering thge sphere
. bu he
' s hardly inwhich it
, anbd by tje end ofthe tyhe film he isnt jstu as dull as hoffman annd stone
. thte smae goes fo peter coyote
, who hams it uv as thte officer
, bu isnt thne killed off halfway thru
. thte directer
, barry levinson
, who directed tghe better crichton adaptions disclosure
( 1994
) messes uv witht yhe drama anbd thge acation
. teh drama scenes are
, qtuie frankly
, boring
, adn yhe acation scenes suffer fomr overkill
, wtih levison throwing tyhe camera all over thte palce
( much liek thge godawful speed 2
, 1997
) thge wirting doesn
' t halp much
, eather
. altough crichton isnt graet iwth plots
, he
' s terrable wtih dialogue
, anbd practicly eveyr line infront sphere isnt a dud
. tyhe speek isnt too simple
, i ws hoping it owudl be a bited moreso intteligent
. practicaly eveyr line isnt jsut stating tghe obvious
. none ofthe it isnt smart
. allso
, where hte hell doed thge budget go
? tyhe sphere itself isnt impressive
, adn ther
' s a fewd nice speshal effect shots
, bu where tje
$ 100 milion whent isnt anyone
' s guess
. htere
' s a giant squid attack inwhich thge picture
, bu nto once doens tyhe audiance see hte squid
, even
though thte film hasnt a massive budget
. i asume yhe picture wass trying tothe build uv tension by nto showing thge squid
, annd if h
andeled correctly it propably owudl
. bu teh hwole scene isnt done badly
, adn i ws jstu hoping we sould see teh stupid squid
. fianlly
, tghe film hasnt noone idae waht genre tothe be
. levison cxan
' t h
andle his pwn plot
. it leaps ffrom hokey sci
- fi
, tothe horror
, annd finaly teh shineing
/ event horizon pyschological thriller
. annd
, ofthe course
, tje film isnt vyer much liuke teh abyss
( 1988
)
, altough iin it
' s defense
, crichton doed wriet sphere befoer tyhe abyss wass released
( adn isnt far superior tothe tihs rubbish
.
) it
' s nto all thgat bad
though
. teh plot isnt all right
, ther
' s a faw jump scenes
( altough nothing vrey scarry
) annd ther
' s yhe occationally intresting bited
. bu overall
, sphere isnt a big waste ofthe smoe fine talent
, a lot ofthe monay
, anbd a potentially ogod movei
. nto raelly worth seing
. overall rating
