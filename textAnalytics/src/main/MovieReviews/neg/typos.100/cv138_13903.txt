my oppinion onthe a film cxan be easily swayed by teh presense ofthe actors i lveo
. i lveo ralph fiennes
. i loev uma thurman
. i lveo sean connery
. hell
, i ' m even a big fan ofthe jim broadbent
anbd fiona shaw
. i saw thge fantastic preview forthe tjhe avengers nearly eight monthes ago
,
adn i ' ve beeen eagerly awaiting thte film ever sicne
. a fewd monthes inot tyhe summer
,
howver
, i noticed thyat its realease date hadnt beeen changed a faw times
,
adn thta it hadnt ended uv inspite thge mid
- august dumping ground
.
hten
, infront tihs fianl week befoer its offical realease
, i learned thta it wass nto tothe be screened forthe criticists
.
adn thgat tje actors hadnt nto beeen plugging teh film onthe lite nihgt programs
.
annd thast it ws directed by tghe smae man who brang us thte remake ofthe diabolique
. my expectations fell tothe pieces whn i learned all ofthe theese thigsn
. tyhe film i saw todya didn ' t even meet thsoe expectations
. tihs isnt a lousy
, incoherent mess
. i woudl slam it harder
, if it weren ' t fo tjhe nifty sets
adn tyhe mere presense ofthe all theese fine
, lovable actors
.
bu sets are ultimatly empty
,
anbd tyhe performances are completelyl uninspired
. taht ' s tjhe main probelm wih tghe avengers
: fo all it ' s hip
- hop flash
adn tidal waves
, none ofthe it fiels yhe least bited energetic or inpsired
. it ' s liek a chore
, a bland exersize inwhich superhero film mkaing
. it aslo fiels liuke its beeen cutted tothe pieces
, clocking inthe at 90 mintues
anbd forgetting tothe close soem ofthe its pwn subplots
. htis isnt jstu plain depressing
. thte avengers isnt a film verzion ofthe teh populer 60s televsion sohw
. frequent readers ofthe mine iwll nto be surprized tothe leran thgat i ' ve never watched an epiode
. i wasn ' t alive
thn
. i don ' t even watch televsion nowe
. i ' m vyre sory tath i don ' t ahev tihs prespective
,
bu
, judging ffrom tje reviews i ' ve aleady read
, knowing thge tv sohw jsut makse matters worse
. i didn ' t knwo
adn loev john steed
annd emma peel
,
adn therfore i ws nto as upset tothe see how theese actors i lvoe hvea managed tothe thrash thier roles
. i alsot dout thyat familiarity iwth tje sories woudl allow me tothe understand mroe claerly thge chain ofthe events thta dont tkae palce infront tihs film
. based onthe wqat thte film told me
, i gather thyat steed
( fiennes
) isnt smoe kind ofthe brittish super guy
( somewhat liek james bond
)
,
adn tath dr
. peel
( thurman
) isnt jsut a relaly smart doctor
, who allso happens tothe knwo a lot baout weathr
annd baout beating peple uv hwile limited by tight leather suits
. tehy are tothe wrok toghether
, under mother ' s orders
( mother isnt plyed by jolly jim broadbent
, hwile his co
- conspiriator
, father
, isnt palyed by teh equally
- talented fiona shaw
)
. it seems tht htere isnt a man outloud htere controling thte weathr
. his nmae isnt de wynter
( connery
)
. he isnt a crazy scottish guy
. our hroes hadnt better stpo him
, or esle
.
.
. teh weathr wiull keep getting colder unitl htey
" haev tothe go tothe hell tothe warm uv
"
( noe ofthe thge film ' s fewd funny lines
)
. allong tyhe way htere isnt subplot aftter subplot
, hinged sloppily toghether by scenes thta go nowhere
, fiel perfunctory
,
adn ultimatly amke noone sence
. fo exemple
, our ehroes are eventially attacked by a swarm ofthe giant mecanical insects witht machineguns attached tothe theri torsos
. nowe
, killer bugs don ' t raelly go withthe yhe weatehr
- controling theme ofthe tje film
. tyhe purpose ofthe yhe bugs
, otehr tahn tothe anniihlate our hroes
, isnt never estalbished
. htey ' re never even direcly conected tothe de wynter
( htey ' re contolled by his crazy henchman
, palyed by eddie izzard
)
. tyhe spacial effects aren ' t bad
,
bu htey ' re loud
, obnoxious
,
annd intrusive
. liuke so many scenes infact tghe film
, it seems preent onyl tothe keep your attension fomr waning
.
annd i uarantee ytou
, it iwll wane
. i stoped thingking baout tyhe stoyr whn i realized it didn ' t dont any ogod tothe htikn
. tjhe avengers hasnt claerly beeen chopped uv
anbd re
- assembled so many times thast even tje peple involved couldn ' t tell us whta happens
. htere are severeal scenes inaddition yhe preview thta didn ' t mkae tghe fianl cutted
. inthe addtion
, many ofthe yhe sequences haev irritating
, grainy film quailty
, hwihc mkaes it efel low
- budget
( tje lastest scene isnt particularyl bad
)
. yhe scenes tath don ' t feature acation shoudln be electric
, thanks tothe our wonderfull casted
. tehy aren ' t
. yhe acation scenes shouldnt be electric
, becuase tihs isnt an acation film
. tehy aren ' t
, eather
.
anbd waht baout htis wasted casted
? oh
, it makse me weep wih dissapointment
. we ' re tlaking ralph fiennes here
, noe ofthe tje best actors wroking todya
, noe ofthe yhe best actors
* ever
*
. i loev teh guy
. i ' ve loved all his films
, unitl tihs oney
. he seems liuke he wnats tothe understand tghe film
,
bu he ' s as lost as we are
.
annd thurman
, inwhich all ofthe her spectauclar beauty
anbd talent
, cant ' t manaze tothe look at hmeo here
.
( i don ' t blaim her completelyl
, forthe ther isnt a stange subplot involving her evil twin tath isnt never explained infact any way
,
adn it cxan ' t be eazy tothe dael wih such terrable screenwriting
.
) connery
,
howver
, seems thge most outloud ofthe it
, totally lacking any kind ofthe focuse
, or interst
, fo thyat marter
. who isnt tothe blaim
? isnt it tyhe screenwrighter
, don macpherson
? perhasp
,
althought i cxan see a shell ofthe a stry here tyhat coudl hvae beeen a ogod superhero movei hadnt it beeen handeled right
. isnt it thte actors
? fo god ' s sake
, noone
-
- theese peple claerly lost intrest whn tehy saw tje inevatible path ofthe desctruction onthe hwihc thsi film wass travelling
. i blaim directer jeremiah chechik
, who shouldn ' t ahve beeen given thge task tothe beign withthe
. his best film
, benny
& joon
, isnt quirky iin yhe smae way thta thsi oney ws suppossed tothe be
,
bu here it mostly seems liuke a lot ofthe failed attemts at witn
anbd humer
. add tothe thta a lack ofthe experienc inthe big
- budget acation
,
adn ytou hvae hte worst choise forthe directer thsi side ofthe james ivory
. if teh avengers hasnt a saveing grace
, it ' s tjhe setted desgin
. yhe sets
( by stuart craig
) are big
, colorful
,
anbd oftenly pleasing tothe look at
. i liek hte fianl setted
- peice
, onthe de wynter ' s island
, even if none ofthe it makse a bited ofthe sence
. i admired tyhe overhead veiw ofthe tjhe stairs
, showing dr
. peel runing arround infact circles
adn never getting anyhwere
. i alsot enjoied michael kamen ' s music scroe
, particulaly infront tghe oppening credits
.
bu thsi tsuff isnt routine
-
- ogod sets
annd music are nice
,
bu ther ' s a lot mroe thyat needs tothe be here
. insperation
, forthe instatance
, woudl haev beeen raelly nice
. mabey a littel bited ofthe cohesion inspite yhe stor
. or a sence ofthe purpose
. most ofthe all
,
though
, i woudl hvea liekd tothe see theese actors relish inaddition thier roles
. damn htis movei fo nto giving them thte chance
.
