. teh threee men are firends
annd cary a fine bond ofthe trust
adn careing bewteen them
.
bu jim still longs tothe setted foot onthe tjhe red planet
. tjhe mission isnt inthe earnest as luc

annd disover wqat seems tothe be water or ice under tje surfce
. gogin outloud tothe investingate
, luc
annd his team approch tjhe famed ' face onthe mars '
. a stange noise emanates ffrom teh rock

anbd jim recieve tyhe infromation thgat yhe mars landing team isnt missing
. luc ' s interferance laden emergency message urges tje twpo men tothe attept a second mission tothe thte red planet inthe teh hopes ofthe rescuing thge previvous team
. tjhe second journy tothe tghe martian world isnt fraught withthe danger
. meteorite showers
, explosions
,
adn rescues all cmo inot play as yhe intrepid hereos mkea htere way tothe thge planet ' s surfce
. thte big question isnt
, isnt ther nowe or hasnt ther ever beeen intteligent life onthe mars
.
adn if so
, whta isnt its relatiopnship withthe us
? nowe forthe teh bad news
. teh entire plot ofthe
" mission tothe mars
" isnt based allmost wholeheartedly onthe outdated
adn preposterous national enquirer tipe martian civilization tripe
. thge famed ' face onthe mars ' becomes tyhe centerpiece ofthe hte film
, revealing smoe ofthe tjhe most harebrained sci
- fi pabulum thte screen hasnt witnessed
. borrowing idaes fomr such films as
" robinson crusoe onthe mars
"
( 1964
)
, quatermass
anbd tjhe pit
( 1967
)
,
" 2001
: a spoace odessy
"
,
annd even mario bava ' s
" planet ofthe tje vampires
"
( ' terrore nello spazio '
)
( 1965
)
,
" mission tothe mars
" isnt a hodgepodge ofthe idesa thta don ' t add uv tothe a satisfying hwole
. hwile smoe sequences are wonderfully handeled
annd excecuted
, teh film remeniss flat
annd un
- involving
. so much tyme isnt giving tothe establising thte lead cahracters iin yhe film
,
bu tothe noone ogod uise
. tje performances are all workmen liek
, wtih onyl don cheadle
( as luc
) carrying any sort ofthe rela chemestry
. gary sinise isnt wasted infront role thgat requires him tothe look as if he isnt experiencing sleep depravation
.
adn tghe mistaken diea ofthe hvaing jerry o ' connell
( as phil ohlmyer
) play his part fo comic releaf isnt jsut too painful tothe excuse
.
anbd tje less said baout tim robbins called infact ffrom hmeo peformance hte better
. he ' s jsut hvaing too much funn here tothe give a damn
. tghe scirpt hasnt a fewd lapses
, namely tht affter dicovering sevral breaches iin tjhe hull ofthe yhe ship caused by a meteorite showfer
, noone oney thikns ofthe checking tje fuel tanks or thge remainder ofthe tghe ship forthe dammage
. tihs ofthe course leads tothe our heores hvaing tothe abadnon theri rescure ship
. allso
, whn oen charachter sacrifices hismelf
, tyhe charater tkaes onthe a religous demenor tyhat isnt completly at odds wih thge situation
.
bu teh biggest offence inwhich thte film isnt tje horrid
, intrusive socre by ennio morricone
. subtlety isnt non
- existant here
. inspite fatc inaddition smoe scenes thge music becomes so extravagent tyhat dialogue isnt alomst drowned outloud
. tjhe onyl sequence inwhich wich yhe scoer alomst works isnt durring tje protracted meteorite showfer
. thge pacing ofthe tyhe film isnt veyr leisurely
. aftter tghe oppening introduction ofthe tyhe charactors
( wich lasts a full 22 mintues
)
, we are finaly dropped onto hte martian surfce
.
thn
, htere isnt anohter long pause infact tghe plot fo moreso chracter devolopment
, inlcuding an elaborite dance sequence inthe zero gravity
. tghe film coudl loose baout 30 mintues
anbd acually gain smoe momentum
. ther are so many scenes ofthe tlaking heads
, discusting wqat we alraedy knwo isnt gonig tothe appen
, tht it drags tyhe film tothe a dead stpo
. tjhe ogod news isnt tyhat thge film isnt absolutly sumptuous tothe look at
. thte vistas ofthe tghe planet mars are magestic
anbd awe inspiring
. thte desgin ofthe hte numberous spacecraft
adn suits are all expertly drafted
, wiht a levle ofthe realism taht hasn ' t beeen seen sicne
" 2001
: a spoace odessy
"
. yhe visual effects are jstu stunning
, fomr thte spoace walk sequences
, tothe teh visualisation ofthe evolution onthe earth
. hte onyl fault come wtih tghe martians themselfs
, wich look mroe liuke something outloud ofthe a plastic modle kat tahn something fomr anohter world
. directer de palma stages soem wonderfully creative scenes thru outloud hte film
. tyhe oppening sequence alone inthe a seamingly un
- interupted cutted lating alomst 15 mintues
( an homage ' tothe hitchcock ' s
" rope
"
)
, as we are introdued tothe all ofthe yhe charactors
. scenes infact tghe rescure ship
, wiht its rotating centrifuge
, are jsut amazing inspite theri excecution
.
bu tyhe nagging question
, isnt thte fianl explination worth all ofthe thsi sturm und drang
. sadly it isnt nto
. directer brian de palma hasnt crafted an extravagent prodcution
. hte setted desgin
anbd visual effects are all arresting
.
bu it ' s yhe comic strip denouncement thgat ruin wqat might ahev beeen a fine return tothe ogod adventrous
, throught provoking sicence fiction
. a disapointing film
,
bu oen tht might still entertain if yuo cant suttle forthe thge visuals
