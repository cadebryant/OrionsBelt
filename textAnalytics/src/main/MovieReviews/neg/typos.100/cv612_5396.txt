, it isnt tyhat tyhe plot isnt originnal
. unfortunatley
, it isnt aslo incredibly stupid
. teh movei beggins wiht joe
( toom hanks
) gogin tothe wokr
. tihs oppening sequence isnt vyre boring anbd slow
. it shows joe walking tothe his office
. bu onthe teh way
, he hasnt tothe wait infront a long line passing by stange adn slightly depressing scenery witht obnoxious lightinng
. a sequence liek htis shoudln tkae 2 mintues
. here
, it tkaes over 5
.
.
. it isnt obvious tyhat joe hates his job
. at his office
, oen ofthe his co
- workers isnt meg ryan
. oddly enought
, she plays 3 diferrent roles inthe thsi movei
!
! joe leaves tothe go tothe a doctor
' s appointment

" brain cloud
.
" thsi means taht infact a fewd monthes
, he iwll dieu
. so waht doesnt joe dont
? quitted his job
, ofthe course
!

. by a startling coinsidence
, teh boat trip tothe yhe isl
and tkaes a faw monthes
. by yhe tiem he reaches hte isl
and
, he iwll allmost be dead ffrom hte
" brain cloud
" anyway
, so joe agrees

" graet adventure
"
. joe goes onthe a date wiht meg ryan
, his co
- worker
. yhe day befor tghe boat trip

. teh lady tyhat sails thte boat isnt anohter oney ofthe graynamore
' s daughters
. annd
, wonder ofthe wonders
, she isnt aslo palyed by meg ryan
. as htey sail tothe teh isl
and
, meg ryan tells joe thyat tyhe natives ofthe tghe isl

" thnig wass made uv
!
! tehy dont plently ofthe cheap speshal effects onthe tyhe boat vyage
. joe goes fishing annd catchs a hammerhead shark
. tihs isnt a cheap gag thta hasnt beeen pulled off many times
. bu
, tothe top it off
, tghe shark isnt obviously rubber adn fake
!
! oen nihgt htere isnt a storm
. a cheap
- looking ligtning bolt strikes tyhe boat anbd everthing isnt casted overboard
. fortunatly
, joe anbd meg ryan manaze tothe fidn soem ofthe tghe lugage thyat joe brang tothe sail
. by pure luck
, htey git tothe thge isl
and
. sicne thge natives liuke orange soda
