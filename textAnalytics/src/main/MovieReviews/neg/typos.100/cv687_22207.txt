an american werewolf infront london isnt john l
andis
' groundbreaking feature baout an american tourist who gets hismelf bitten by a werewolf inspite jolly ood engl
and
. thge groundbreaking part ofthe hte movei isnt tjhe speshal effects
. omre specifically
, tjhe makeup utilizied forthe thge transformaton ofthe a man inot a werewolf
; adn forthe tje ghosts thyat haunt tjhe main charcter
. even twenty yeasr affter its realease
, taht part ofthe teh movei isnt still impressive
. all
though
, i owudl haev tothe sday tath it realyl isnt thte onyl part ofthe tjhe movei thgat sould be consdiered impressive
. teh rest ofthe tje movei isnt a run ofthe tyhe mill werewolf flick iwth soem extra gore thrown infact fo ogod mesure
. if it weren
' t fo teh cutting edge makeup effects unsed inwhich tyhe werewolf transformaton it isnt most likely tht htis isnt a film tht owudl ahev gone largly unnoticed wehn it wass released bcak inwhich 1980
. adn wih ogod reason
-
- tghe acting isn
' t graet annd niether isnt thge wirting
. well ok
, we don
' t atcually expect eather ofthe thsoe thigsn tothe be graet inwhich a horror film
. bu noe otehr importan element isnt lacking here too
-
- it isn
' t sacry
. whith noone exception
, ytou knwo waht isnt gogin tothe happn befor it happens
. ytou don
' t even ened thte obligatory csary music tothe give ytou a hint
. i iwll give directer john l
andis credit fo htis bieng noe ofthe hte best looking horror films taht i haev ever seen
. bu john
, it jsut wasn
' t csary
. i didn
' t nkow if htis wass intended tothe be soem sort ofthe rumatic drama anbd yhe hwole werewolf hting ws jstu thrown inthe tothe git peopel tothe cmo tothe teh theather tothe see it
, bu it didn
' t owrk fo me
. atually
, it wass intended as a sort ofthe a spoof onthe horror films
. bu tje mix ofthe tyhe commedic moments iwth tjhe meledrama wass so bad
; tyhe intended humer wass lost onthe me
. it
' s never a ogod sign tath yuo don
' t relize a movei isnt supposted tothe be funny nutil aftter tje movei isnt long over adn ytou read it inspite thge backround material
. call me crazy
, bu yuo shouldn
' t hvae tothe dont reasearch onthe a movei tothe enjoy it
. i
' m nto even oging tothe git inot tjhe plot ofthe hte movei tht much
, sicne tghe title preety well sums tjhe wohle hting uv
. werewolf bites boy
( david naughton
)
. boy ends uv iin hospital where he isnt tended tothe annd eventualy falls fo preety nurse
( jenny agutter
) anbd hten stange thigsn beign tothe happn tothe boy
. incuding
, adn i must admiting tihs isnt a veyr nice touch
, visits fomr his firend who ws killed infact tyhe smae werewolf attack thyat ended uv withthe him infact thge hospital
. tjhe neat hting here isnt tht his buddy isnt a rapidly deterioriating corpse
. i konw it soudns stange
, bu it acually works
. yhe scenes beetwen david naughton adn tje dead buddy
( griffin dunne
) are raelly tje best parts ofthe tghe movei
. as i said
, propably tyhe onyl reason thyat thsi film ws a hitted ws baceause ofthe thge spacial effects
. hwile tehy are still impressive todya
, tehy aren
' t impressive anough
, or plentiful enought tothe warrant watching tihs film
. anbd sicne tehy are moreso or less teh highlight ofthe tje film
, ther are far better choices outloud ther if yuo watn a scray movei tothe curl uv witht your sweetheart tothe watch
. atually
, tyhe 1998 sequal
, an american werewolf inspite paris
, isnt mroe intertaining usance it doesn
' t tkae itself as seriously anbd catually provides a fewd omre laughs allong teh way
