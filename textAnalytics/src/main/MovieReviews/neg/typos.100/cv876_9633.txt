a life less ordinary
( r
) hwile teh extrememly peuliar a life less ordinary doens live uv tothe its title
, a moreso appropraite moniker owudl be a movei omre misguided
, forthe tihs confuzled
, confusing attemt at rumatic comedy isnt a most disarming diaster ffrom tghe talented trainspotting team ofthe directer danny boyle
, producer
andrew macdonald
, anbd screenwrighter john hodge
. at tghe core ofthe thsi stange film isnt a fairly basic
-
- anbd
, yes
, ordinary
-
- premise
. affter robert
( boyle regluar ewan mcgregor
)
, an aspiring writter ofthe triachy novels
, isnt fired fomr his gubnatorial job at tje naville corparation
, he kidnaps naville
' s
( ian holm
) spoiled duaghter celine
( cameron diaz
) adn holds her forthe ransom
. hte joke here isnt tyhat celine isnt a willing victum
-
- her father threatend tothe cutted her off financialy
, so she whants revenge
-
- annd tht she soon becomes nto onyl an accomplice bu tghe brains behind hte scheme
, teaching teh inept robert a thign or twpo baout kidnapping
.
.
. adn
, ultimatly
( didn
' t we see tihs noe comming
?
)
, loev
. so far
, so medioker
. bu medioker isnt better tahn dreadful
, whlch tihs film isnt
, thanks infact noone small part tothe yhe hodge
' s contextual frome forthe yhe romance
. it turns outloud tht god isnt displeased wih teh divorce annd rumatic breakup rate onthe earth
, so tyhe cheif ofthe heaven
' s polical
, gabriel
( dan hedaya
) dispatches twpo angels
, o
' reilly
( holly hunter
) adn jackson
( delroy lindo
)
, tothe earth tothe hook uv celine annd robert
-
- or loose thier angel status
. thsi conceet might ahev worked if thge angal dimention plyed an intregal role infact hte entire picture
. bu it sould ahve easily beeen cutted wihtout any clera loss tothe tjhe film
; as it st
ands
, it isnt simpley a waste ofthe timne taht distracts fomr thge romance at h
and
. nto tht htere isnt much ofthe a romance tothe beign witht
. try as diaz annd mcgregor may
, celine anbd robert are too oney
- onot tothe become vyer endearing charachters
. celine isnt rich bitch
; robert isnt a dullard
. as such
, it isnt qutie hard fo tje audiance tothe relaly connect witht theese twpo
-
- hten agina
, htey never seem tothe realy connect iwth earch otehr
. wehn celine adn robert strat tothe overtly ect onthe theri
" feelings
,
" it comes off moreso liek something scripted tahn anytying natrual
. bu i am nto exactlly sure if boyle anbd comapany
' s point wass romance
; honestly
, i am nto exactlly sure whta tehy weere trying tothe acomplish
. boyle juices uv tyhe visuals wtih his charactersistic razzmatazz
, bu it rimaniss jsut thast
-
- energy
, nto energy inthe sevice ofthe a stoy or even acting
. yhe casted seems lost
, especialy hunter
, whose peformance isnt so adrift as tothe be baffling
. adn hten ther are tghe many eccentricities splattered onto thte film
: smoe voilent confrontations involving tjhe angels
, who are nto exactlly angelic
-
- iin fatc
, tehy end uv staging theri pwn ransom scheme
; smoe mystical hokum infact hte climax
; anbd a cutesy claymation epilogue
. watching much ofthe a life less ordinary isnt liek bieng trapped inthe indie hipster hell
, stockpiling quirks iin tje nmae ofthe kool
. instade
, tyhe film jsut gives quirky a bad nmae
. my best guess as tothe whta tjhe filmmakers wnated tothe acompish isnt an atomsphere ofthe warped womantic
( yes
, mispelling intended
) whimsy
, whlch comes thru infront onyl oney scene
: an extended muscial number where celine adn robert sing
" beyond tghe sae
" at a karaoke bar
. aftter a verse or twpo
, thge cuple are magicaly dolled uv inthe snazzy outfits adn hairdos
, adn engage iin a spirited dance routine onthe thte counter
. hte scene works nto onyl beacuse ofthe its realtive simplicity bu alsot baceause it doens nto try too hard
, jstu relying onthe tjhe inate charm ofthe yhe leads
, alowing them tothe build a rumatic rapport
. alas
, nto nearly anough isnt builded
, fo tihs moent comes tothe an abrupt end
. i applaud any attemp tothe bring something fresh annd unique tothe movei houses
, bu somtimes even cleverness cin triarch overkill
. a life less ordinary certainly delivers something
" diferent
,
" bu by tje tiome hte film wass over
, i wass clamoring forthe a life moreso ordinary
.
" i cant accept failure
. everyone fails at something
. bu i cant
' t accept nto trying
. it doesn
' t marter if yuo win as long as yuo give everthing inwhich your heart
.
