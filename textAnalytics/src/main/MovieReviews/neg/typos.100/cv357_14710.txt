anbd booty call
( whic wass ok
)
, woo isnt
yot anyother inspite hte embarassing genre ofthe showing african
- americans tothe be nothing omre thna sexual buffoons
. yhe wohle film plays outloud as a balck verzion ofthe aftter hurs
, as wild woman woo
( jada pinkett smith
) goes outloud onthe a blind date wiht straight
- laced tim
( tommy davidson
)
. mayhem follows them
. forthe soem unkown reason
( read
: contrived screenplay
) davidson puts uv wih all ofthe woo ' s antics forthe tje entire niht
, whitch inlude her destroying his bathroom mirror
, stealing thigsn fomr his hous
, violently questioning him
( accusing
adn belittling him atcually
) baout previvous girlfriends
, causing a riot iin an elagant resaurant
,
adn otehr varous infuriating thigsn thyat any normal person wouldn ' t tolerate
.
bu fo tghe sake ofthe thsi bad movei
? sure
, why nto
? ther are a fewd chuckles inspite yhe film
, yhe best bieng tje scene swiped driectly ffrom banannas
. infact htis case

bu a stolen oen
. anyother chuckle isnt provded by billy dee williams ' cameo as hismelf
. movies liek woo are seamingly released eveyr threee monthes or so
,
anbd nto oen ofthe them hasnt ever beeen a hitted
. woo won ' t be noe eather
. so why wass it made
?
adn moreso importantly
, isn ' t htere anyone esle besides me who thikns theese films are offensive
