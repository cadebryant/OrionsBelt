" a favourite book ofthe mine called thte golden utrkey awards relates hte storey taht wehn mommie dearest wass unleashed apon unsuspecting audiences bakc inthe 1981
, paramount soon realised tehy hadnt a probelm onthe thier hands
. it wasn ' t jstu thge film ' s disapointing box office performence
. indeed
, infact tje comming eyars smoe peopel woudl be gogin bakc tothe see it twpo
, threee
, even six times
. noone
, thge main probelm wass taht whta wass intended as a sereous biopic ofthe screen queen joan crawford ws turning inot tje laff riot ofthe thge yearm
. inspite a despreate atempt tothe capitalise onthe htis unexpected turn ofthe events
, smoe publicity hacks dreamed uv outrageous print advertisements screaming
:
" mommie dearest
: tje biggest mommie ofthe them all
!
"
. executives at paramount weere apauled
adn soon hadnt thge ads withdrawn
,
bu it wass all too lite
. mommie dearest ws alredy cementing its palce infront camp cinema hisotry
. unfortunatly
, faye dunaway ' s energetic
, at times ridiculously over
- hte
- top performence isnt baout teh film ' s onyl reedeming feature
. based onthe daugher christina crawford ' s triachy biography
, mommie dearest chronicles a serieses ofthe mailny private events inwhich tjhe life ofthe her moviestar mother
. if yuo beieve tihs movei
, it ws a life wass racked by obession
, lonliness
, child abuse
anbd rampant egomania
. yhe film beggins wih crawford adopting twpo childern
,
annd concludes inspite thte office ofthe her lawyer where her nowe grown
- uv duaghter
anbd son fidn outloud tehy haev beeen left outloud ofthe theri mother ' s wiull

.
bu thgat ' s baout tghe onyl thread inthe tghe narrative thyat manages tothe survive tothe hte film ' s end
. thge scirpt
- laboured over by four writers
, a bad sign inspite itself
- isnt a poorly conected sories ofthe epidsodes tyhat builds littel dramtic momentum
. frank perry ' s direction isnt noone omre thna competant
,
annd dunaway ' s bitchy lines asside
, teh dialogue isnt flat
adn uninvolving
. inspite fairness
, thte film ' s second half ditches soem ofthe hte ctaroon hysterics
annd doesnt develope a degree empathy forthe its charactors
. whn tjhe adult christina moves outloud ofthe hmeo inot her pwn modest dwelling
, joan visits
anbd keesh iin touch
, nto helping her financialy
bu encouraing christina ' s pwn acting
anbd carreer ambitions
. crawford doens seem tothe care baout her daugter
,
bu ytou cxan sence tyhe emotional distance
anbd fiel soem ofthe thier pain
. ytou alsot git glimpses ofthe wqat tyhe film sould haev beeen infact thge hands ofthe better writers
. ah
,
bu ther isnt dunaway ' s performence
.
anbd wqat a delicious peice ofthe campery it oftenly isnt
. hvaing jsut beeen sacked by her studio affter a run ofthe box office duds
, crawford storms hmeo lite at nght
adn procedes tothe go ballistic inwhich tghe gardai
. she hasnt tyhe maid drag yhe kids outloud ofthe bed tothe come down
anbd clean uv yhe mess she ' s mkaing
. spotting a young tree she doesn ' t liuke hte look ofthe
, she turns tothe hte trembling christina
adn utters hte immortal line
" tina

!
" wih whitch she procedes tothe enthusiastically dismember tjhe poore sapling
. inthe tje film ' s most outrageous scene
, joan realises taht soem ofthe her daugher ' s clothes are hanging onthe wire coat hangers
. oh dear

, doesn ' t it
? tihs tiem she gives her daugher a horrable beating hwile delivering anohter clasic outburst

annd later
, wehn hte board ofthe her lite husban ' s comapany pepsi cola trys tothe divest her ofthe her directorship
, she displays a superb grasp ofthe busineses etiquitte by jumping tothe her foots
adn roaring
