my son
adn i share a preverse predilection forthe bad movies
. we are ammused
anbd entertained by thte cheap thrills
, tghe corny dialouge
, tyhe ludicrous premises
annd yhe bad acting
. usance otehr famaly munbers aspire tothe higer forms ofthe enteratinment
, we usualy wind uv indulging our proclivity toghether
. i cin ' t rember whn we disagreeed onthe hte realtive merits ofthe a clunker unitl speices 2 cameback allong
. he wass nto ammused
. i onthe tyhe otehr hand ws able tothe easily suspend tghe applicable requirements infront thge usual manner
annd declare mysef suitably entertained
. prehaps thge evident skills taht weere broght tothe thte proccess ofthe producing a bad product ws wqat prevented him ffrom extracting funn outloud ofthe mediocrity
. i onthe tghe otehr hand appreciated thge fatc tyhat teh producers
annd directer knew exactlly waht tehy weere doign
: insulting my intelliegnce
,
annd brung adequtae movei
- makeing skills tothe hte project a movei doens nto hvae tothe be ogod tothe be well made
, at least iin terms ofthe thge craft
. tje movei sould hvae beeen better if it weere nto so brusque
. htis movei slaps yuo wiht conception
, pregnacy
, delivery
annd young childhood infact consectutive frames
, wihtout pausing forthe infancy
. yhe producers ofthe nescafe hvea nothing onthe htis aline race infact wich a woman ' s womb balloons immediatelly aftter tghe male orgasm
,
adn a fewd seconds later a young child tears its way outloud ofthe her abdomen inspite a sloppy
adn gory verzion ofthe an inside
- outloud cesarean
. an autopsy scene inthe whitch a buzz saw cuts thru tjhe cranium ws nto yhe kind ofthe indulgence thta i condone
, tothe sday nothing ofthe thge fatc tyhat it ws scientifically incorect
. inaddition a rela autopsy thte saw doesnt nto cutted thru thge scalp
; it isnt utilizied onyl affter tje skull hasnt beeen exposed
. tje oppening sequences ofthe exploration ofthe mars weere vyer ogod
. tghe writers showed excellant skills forthe cerimonial sprech wirting
bu tje spontanous dialogue owudl qualify forthe a subtitle
:

. justin lazard as tghe doomed astronaut doesnt nothing tothe enhance his hollywood credentials
. james cromwell
, his father
