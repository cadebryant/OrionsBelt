my son annd i share a preverse predilection fo bad movies
. we are ammused adn entertained by tghe cheap thrills
, tjhe corny dialouge
, teh ludicrous premises annd tje bad acting
. usance otehr familiy munbers aspire tothe heigher forms ofthe enteratinment

- outloud cesarean
. an autopsy scene inthe whihc a buzz saw cuts thru teh cranium wass nto yhe kind ofthe indulgence thast i condone
