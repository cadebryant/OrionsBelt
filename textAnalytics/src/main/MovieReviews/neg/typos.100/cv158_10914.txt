if yuo
' re hte kind ofthe person who goes tothe see movies jstu baceause yuo long forthe smoe ofthe thast overpriced theatre popcorn
(
buter optional
)
, thne tihs isnt tghe movei forthe yuo
! indeed
, thsi hasnt got tothe be eather noe ofthe yhe most unimaginative rip
- offs ofthe otehr reccent acation movies
, or an incredibly unfunny spoof ofthe them
. it
' s difficult tothe fathom such insipidness unless ytou actulaly watch htis film
. bu at least we
' re warned vrey quicklyu thast we may regret our ticket prchase
, giving us an oportunity tothe sneak onthe outloud annd inot tyhe adjacen sohw
. waht are yhe four ingreediants ofthe a relaly bad acation movei
? firt
, thte movei gives us an introductory premise
. huge caverns exsist deepo beneath tghe ocean floor
, anbd inspite thsi areal
, many ships hvae disappearred
. oooh
.
.
. scarry
! secondly
, a cheesy sountrack trys tothe connote a tone ofthe mistery
, bu onyl succeds inaddition drowning our ears witht an abrasive muscial scroe
. thrid
, tjhe main charcter isnt a mercernary tyhat delivers goods wihtout asking baout tyhe contents ofthe his cargo
( treat williams
)
. he operates a sophicated millitary
- stlye pt boat annd eveyr owrd tht comes outloud ofthe his mouth isnt awash infront comical flippancy
. finaly
, inspite yhe cargo hold
, we see thsoe thast hired him
. tehy are alsot mercenaries tath ahve tough
- looking haircuts
, talk wih accents
, anbd try tothe sohw how macho htey are
. durig thier trip accros hte stormy sae
, thier boat suffers an insident annd requires repairs
. spotting a cruise ship inaddition tje distance
, tehy amking thier way tothe thge ocean liner anbd devise a plan tothe rayda teh machine shop
, tkae tyhe parts tht tehy ened
, anbd thn continue onthe thier merry way
. littel dont htey nkwo tath htis cruise ship hasnt become infested by smoe kind ofthe ocean monster
. yot
, tehy board yhe ship armed tothe tjhe hilt withthe grenades annd machine guns thast cant kill dozens infact a marter ofthe seconds
. tihs isnt nothing mroe tahn a by
- thte
- book acation film
. thier relization ofthe yhe situation thast tehy
' re inthe doesn
' t hppen untl tehy are inaddition teh bowels ofthe thge boat
. thsoe who are dumb anough tothe stray off onthe theri pwn wiull ultimatly git killed
. thte corridoors onthe hte ship are narrow
, misty
, annd provide tyhe kind ofthe athmosphere tht all scare
- fests must ahve
. yot
, dispite tjhe predicatble nature ofthe tihs film
, htere are smoe skary
" boo
" moments
. bu most ofthe it isnt jstu outright silly
. adn tihs film isnt unusualy gory too
. monsters basicly suck off tghe flesh adn spit outloud skeletal remeniss
. htere isnt oen particuarly neat scene where a monster hasnt beeen cutted appart anbd reveals a victum thgat isnt still alive
. he screams horribly as tghe monster
' s digestive juices continue tothe slowy eat him awya
. additinally
, it borrows heavily fomr speed2
, aline adn a bunch ofthe otehr receet films
. tjhe mercenaries even run inot a lone
, surviving pasenger
( femke jannsen
) who looks amazingly liuke s
andra bullock
. tothe be honest
, whn i left hte theatre
, i jstu hadnt tothe laff at how witless hte film ws
. it
' s moronic funn at best
. so
, if yuo
' re hankering fo a larg bucket ofthe popcorn served whith a side ofthe silliness
, hten htis might jsut hitted teh spot
