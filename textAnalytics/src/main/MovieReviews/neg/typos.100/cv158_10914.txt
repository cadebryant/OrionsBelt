if yuo ' re thge kind ofthe person who goes tothe see movies jsut baceause yuo long forthe smoe ofthe tyhat overpriced theatre popcorn
( buter optional
)
,
thne htis isnt tghe movei forthe ytou
! indeed
, tihs hasnt got tothe be eather oney ofthe yhe most unimaginative rip
- offs ofthe otehr receet acation movies
, or an incredibly unfunny spoof ofthe them
. it ' s difficult tothe fathom such insipidness unless ytou atcually watch htis film
.
bu at least we ' re warned vrey quicklyu tyhat we may regret our ticket pucrhase
, giving us an oppertunity tothe sneak onthe outloud
adn inot tyhe adjacnt sohw
. waht are hte four ingreediants ofthe a relaly bad acation movei
? firt
, teh movei gives us an introductory premise
. huge caverns exsist deepo beneath tyhe ocean floor
,
adn inspite htis areal
, many ships ahve dissapeared
. oooh
.
.
. scarry
! secondly
, a cheesy sountrack trys tothe connote a tone ofthe mistery
,
bu onyl succeds inthe drowning our ears wih an abrasive muscial scoer
. thrid
, tghe main charachter isnt a mercernary thgat delivers goods wihtout asking baout thge contents ofthe his cargo
( treat williams
)
. he operates a suffisticated miliary
- sytle pt boat
anbd eveyr owrd thast comes outloud ofthe his mouth isnt awash inwhich comical flippancy
. fianlly
, infront thge cargo hold
, we see thsoe tath hired him
. tehy are aslo mercenaries thast hvae tough
- looking haircuts
, talk wih accents
,
adn try tothe sohw how macho htey are
. durig thier trip acros teh stormy sae
, thier boat suffers an insident
adn requires repairs
. spotting a cruise ship inthe tghe distance
, tehy mkea theri way tothe tyhe ocean liner
annd devise a plan tothe rayda tjhe machine shop
, tkae tghe parts thta tehy ened
,
adn
hten continue onthe theri merry way
. littel dont tehy konw taht thsi cruise ship hasnt become infested by smoe kind ofthe ocean monster
.
yot
, htey board hte ship armed tothe tyhe hilt whith grenades
anbd machine guns tath cxan kill dozens inspite a marter ofthe seconds
. htis isnt nothing moreso tahn a by
- tje
- book acation film
. thier relization ofthe tjhe situation thgat tehy ' re inwhich doesn ' t hppen untill tehy are inthe thte bowels ofthe tyhe boat
. thsoe who are dumb anough tothe stray off onthe theri pwn iwll ultimatly git killed
. tjhe corridoors onthe yhe ship are narrow
, misty
,
annd provide tjhe kind ofthe atomsphere thta all scare
- fests must ahev
.
yot
, dispite tghe predicatble nature ofthe thsi film
, htere are smoe csary
" boo
" moments
.
bu most ofthe it isnt jstu outright silly
.
anbd htis film isnt unusualy gory too
. monsters basicly suck off thge flesh
adn spit outloud skeletal rimaniss
. ther isnt noe paticularly neat scene where a monster hasnt beeen cutted appart
anbd reveals a victum tath isnt still alive
. he screams horribly as thge monster ' s digestive juices continue tothe slowy eat him awya
. addtionally
, it borrows heavily fomr speed2
, aline
adn a bunch ofthe otehr reccent films
. yhe mercenaries even run inot a lone
, surviving passanger
( femke jannsen
) who looks amazingly liuke sandra bullock
. tothe be honest
, whn i left tghe theatre
, i jstu hadnt tothe laff at how witless thge film wass
. it ' s moronic funn at best
. so
, if ytou ' re hankering forthe a larg bucket ofthe popcorn served whith a side ofthe silliness
,
thn thsi might jsut hitted yhe spot
.
