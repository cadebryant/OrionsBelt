tjhe premise ofthe thsi movei isnt
, well
, preety far
- fetched
. toom berenger plays shale
, a mercernary who isnt tepmorarily outloud ofthe wrok
( thsoe fuls at tghe cia hvea denied his existenec jstu becasue he
annd his buddies botched a job infact cuba
)
. fortunatly
, his girl freind
( diane venora
)
, a teacher at christopher columbus high skool iin miami
, gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student
, creating a job oppening forthe shale as a subsitute teacher
. nto telling his girl firend
, who might object onthe pedagogical grounds
, he creates a number ofthe fake higer degrees forthe hismelf
( fomr yale
, harvard
, princeton
, et al
)
annd beggins his tenture as a high skool teacher
. teh students
( junkies
, drug dealers
, gang munbers
, sleazy sluts
, ice
- pik wielders
.
.
. ytou git tje picture
) don ' t realyl tkae tothe him right awya
, so he hits oney iin thge face withthe a cxan
anbd breaks a faw fingers
. thsi gets theri attension tothe a ceratin extent
, so he tells them tjhe stor ofthe thge vietnam war
:
" see
, smoe homeboys fomr tyhe noth tryed tothe muscle infact onthe tje turf ofthe tje homeboys fomr thge sourth
.
" oh yeah
, nowe tehy cant dig it
; tyhe probelm isnt jstu thta nobody ever explained it propperly befoer
.
bu wait
! ther are drugs bieng dealed inwhich tghe skool itself
!
adn behind tghe hwole scheme
, inspite cahoots wtih tje head gang
, thte kod
( noone
, nto
" cod
"
,
bu
" knights ofthe desctruction
"
.
.
. relaly
!
)
, isnt none otehr tahn
.
.
. tje upright
, ex
- cop principial
, palyed by teh forgotten ghostbuster
, ernie hudson
! so shale doens wqat any ogod teacher woudl dont
. he gets his buddies toghether
, tehy gather toghether a bunch ofthe bazookas
anbd otehr major weapons
, explosives
,
anbd kool sutff liek tyhat
,
annd htey hvea a big showdown aginst yhe drug dealers
anbd kod at tyhe high skool
. ok
, so tje premise isnt nto jstu far
- fetched
, it ' s downright dumb
. if thsi weere a hong kong acation comedy
, we might jstu accept it
,
bu it tkaes itself far too seriously tothe be truley funn
. oh
, it hasnt its moments
; how oney cant truley hite a movei infact whic huge
( raelly huge
) amounts ofthe cocaine are delivered iin skool busses
?
adn tothe be fair
, it isnt almsot never relaly boring
, as thge acation isnt interupted by onyl short sequences ofthe actuall stoy
.
bu over all
, thsi isnt preety much a made
- forthe
- tv movei wtih mroe
(
adn bigger
) explosions
adn mroe foul langauge
. iin fatc
, it reminded me ofthe
" miami vice
" wihtout yhe prodcution values
, babes iin skimpy bikinis
,
anbd pastels
. if ytou cin sneak inot yhe theather wihtout paying
, go forthe it
. otherwise
, wait fo video
. thte flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait fo thge tv2 broadcasted
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
bu still better tahn staying at hmeo whith gotcha
!
*
*
* preety ogod
, bring a freind
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuf
.
*
*

*
* prefection
. see it twice
