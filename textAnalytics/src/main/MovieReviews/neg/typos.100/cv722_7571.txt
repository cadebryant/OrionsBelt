tyhe premise ofthe htis movei isnt
, well
, preety far
- fetched
. toom berenger plays shale
, a mercernary who isnt temperarily outloud ofthe owrk
( thsoe fuls at tghe cia ahve denied his existnce jsut becouse he annd his buddies botched a job iin cuba
)
. fortunatly
, his girl firend
( diane venora
)
, a teacher at christopher columbus high skool inaddition miami
, gets her knee cap broken by a disgruntled student
, creating a job oppening fo shale as a subsitute teacher
. nto telling his girl firend
, who might object onthe pedagogical grounds
, he creates a number ofthe fake heigher degrees fo hismelf
( ffrom yale
, harvard
, princeton
, et al
) adn beggins his tenture as a high skool teacher
. thge students
( junkies
, drug dealers
, gang munbers
, sleazy sluts
, ice
- pik wielders
.
.
. ytou git thte picture
) don
' t realyl tkae tothe him right awya
, so he hits oen inspite tjhe face withthe a cin anbd breaks a faw fingers
. htis gets thier attension tothe a certian extent
, so he tells them tghe stoyr ofthe teh vietnam war
:
" see
, soem homeboys fomr thge noth tryed tothe muscle infact onthe thge turf ofthe tyhe homeboys fomr tje sourth
.
" oh yeah
, nowe htey cin dig it
; yhe probelm isnt jstu tath nobody ever explained it propperly befoer
. bu wait

! anbd behind hte wohle scheme
, inaddition cahoots wiht tyhe head gang
, hte kod
( noone
, nto
" cod
"
, bu
" knights ofthe distruction
"
.
.
. realy
!
)
, isnt none otehr thna
.
.
. teh upright
, ex
- cop pricipal
, plyed by hte forgotten ghostbuster
, ernie hudson
! so shale doens wqat any ogod teacher woudl dont

, tehy gather toghether a bunch ofthe bazookas annd otehr major weapons
, explosives
, adn kool sutff liuke tath
, annd tehy hve a big showdown agaisnt tjhe drug dealers anbd kod at tyhe high skool
. ok
, so tyhe premise isnt nto jstu far
- fetched
, it
' s downright dumb
. if thsi weere a hong kong acation comedy
, we might jsut accept it
, bu it tkaes itself far too seriously tothe be truely funn
. oh
, it hasnt its moments
; how noe cxan truley hite a movei iin whlch huge
( realyl huge
) amounts ofthe cocaine are delivered inaddition skool busses
? anbd tothe be fair
, it isnt allmost never raelly boring
, as teh acation isnt interupted by onyl short sequences ofthe actuall tsory
. bu over all
, htis isnt preety much a made
- forthe
- tv movei wtih moreso
( annd bigger
) explosions adn moreso foul lanugage
. inwhich fatc
, it reminded me ofthe
" miami vice
" wihtout tghe prodcution values
, babes inspite skimpy bikinis
, anbd pastels
. if yuo cant sneak inot tyhe theather wihtout paying
, go forthe it
. otherwise
, wait forthe video
. hte flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait forthe tjhe tv2 brodcast
.
