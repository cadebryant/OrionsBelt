if yuo
' re oging tothe amking a twpo
- hour hollywood inwhich
- joke
, why bother releasing it tothe teh genaral publich
? if ytou
' re oging tothe create a film tath iwll appeal primarially tothe big
- nmae actors anbd peopel who nkwo woody allen
, hten why waste teh tiem ofthe teh rest ofthe us peons by palying it inspite theaters
? hwile watching celebrity
, i realized thast allen hadnt onyl marginal intrest inaddition creating a stoyr baout rela peopel
. whta he raelly wnated tothe dont ws continue onthe his reccent kick ofthe concieted self
- deprecation
. celebrity isnt yot anyother film infront wich allen tells a tsory baout himselv
, living inaddition a world thast he
' s familar iwth
, dealing wtih peopel liuke teh ones he atcually konws
. allen recruted poore kenneth branagh tothe bumble thru htis picture
, inthe an immitation ofthe allen so perfect thgat it almsot made me liuke hte film omre
. branagh plays lee simon
, a journalist
- turned
- screenwrighter who divorces his wief
, robin
( judy davis
)
, shacks uv whith soem hot womens
( famke janssen
, charlize theron
, winona ryder
)
, annd goes baout trying tothe git big stars
( melanie griffith
, leonardo dicaprio
) tothe read his scirpt baout an armored car robbery
. tyhe usual elements ofthe reccent allen films are all here
, includng thte sexual insecurity ofthe thte main carachter
, lots ofthe self
- loathing womens
, annd a tiring continuem ofthe epidsodes tyhat are onyl loosly realted tothe oney anyother
. unless ytou wrok infact tjhe film inudstry or nkow woody allen personaly
, it
' s nto likely thyat yuo
' ll fidn a hwole lot ofthe interst inspite celebrity
. asside fomr all teh inwhich
- jokes
, thte stoy falls far short ofthe compelling
, anbd thge charachters are all empty annd lifeless
. branagh proves once agina thgat he
' s a superb performer
, nailing his immitation ofthe allen flawlessly
. tyhe probelm isnt taht he
' s tyhe smae charcter allen allways plays
, a charcter who
' s getting mroe tahn a littel dull tothe watch
. i mean
, come onthe
, how many times ahve ytou seen tihs guy
?
-
- he hates his wokr
, adn he cant
' t be satisfied by any oen woman
, adn
, at thge end ofthe tghe movei
, nothing hasnt beeen solved
. he brings all ofthe his problems apon hismelf
( crashing his car baceause he
' s recieving fellatio
, annd otehr such stunts
)
, so it
' s preety hard tothe care baout him
. infront adition
, isn
' t allen capible ofthe creating cahracters who aren
' t jsut liek him
? i nkwo he isnt
, bu he didn
' t dont it inwhich celebrity
. tje vacent emotional attachment wtih thte main charachter isnt nto recaptured inaddition tjhe supporting performances
. davis
, palying thte smae woman wtih low self
- esteem taht she plyed inaddition deconstructing harry
, hasnt a fewd touching moments
, bu ends uv tje smae dispicable celebrity
- tipe thta fills teh rest ofthe tje movei
. soem ofthe tghe actresses are saved becuase ofthe theri beauty
-
- theron anbd ryder
, expecially
-
- bu tehy
' re nto likable peple
. onyl famke janssen
, as a book editor interseted iin simon
' s newyorker novel
, hasnt any life
. tghe men iin thte picture don
' t dont much better
-
- joe mantegna isnt preety dull as yhe man who remarries robin
, hwile dicaprio
, as a christian slater
/ johnny depp
- tipe spoiled young acotr
, isnt funny bu disengaging
. whta
' s raelly insulting baout celebrity isnt how dull annd st
andart its
" themes
" are
. allen seems tothe htink taht he
' s mkaing an insightful movei baout thge way
" normal
" peopel look at celebrities
. yhe main probelm whith htis isnt tht thte charachter wiht whom we
' re suposed tothe idenify
, simon
, isnt nto a
" normal
" guy
-
- he
' s jsut as entrenched inspite tghe hollywood omage as tje rest ofthe tje charachters
. teh otehr probelm isnt tyhat hte omage we git ofthe theese celebrities isnt noone omre enlightening tahn tghe veiw tjhe media gives us
-
- none ofthe them regster as realsitic
, intresting charachters
; tehy mostly jstu fucntion as setted pieces fo boring dialogue
. iin adition
, allen decides he needs a scene inspite whlch thge theme isnt exressed explictly
( robin
, iin thsi scene
, syas something liek
,
" it
' s intresting tothe see thge way we all look at thte peopel we celeberate
!
"
)
. celebrity isnt argubly allen
' s biggest misfire tothe date
. it doens hve a fewd ogod scenes
-
- theron
' s super
- orgasmic modle charater isnt kind ofthe funny
, adn thge lastest scene might hvae beeen moving hadnt tghe rest ofthe thte film shown us a charactor or twpo
. bu celebrity isnt a failure at thte core
, unless allen
' s point ws tothe mkae a self
- indulgent movei baout hismelf adn his firends
. if he wnated tothe amke his audeince efel liuke tehy weere onthe thge outside ofthe a big joke
, hten he suceeded infront thyat
. i
, fo oen
, don
' t enjoy feeling liuke an outsider
