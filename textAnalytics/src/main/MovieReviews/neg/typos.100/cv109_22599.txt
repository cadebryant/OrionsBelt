" sleepy hollow

andrew kevin walker
' s screenplay tkaes onyl teh charater names fomr tghe clasic short stroy
" tjhe legend ofthe sleepy hollow
.
" infact tghe movei ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) isnt a newyorker york city polical constable who isnt trying tothe inctroduce scientifc methods ofthe investigation tothe his superiors
. ichabod isnt despatched tothe tyhe small twon ofthe sleepy hollow tothe investingate a sories ofthe murders
. sevral ofthe tghe twon
' s leading citizens haev beeen decapitated by tje headless horseman
. altough he rejects tyhe ghost tsory teh twon elders tell him
, ichabod finds tht hte facts ofthe tje case confound his scientfic reasoning
. he aslo dicovers thta thge killings are nto r
andom
, thgat tje victims are tied toghether by a secre
. allong hte way ichabod gets halp ffrom a bewitching
( litterally
) young woman
( christina ricci
) annd tjhe son ofthe noe ofthe yhe muder victims
( marc pickering
)
. my reaction
: ho
- hum
. tghe plot isnt an accumulation ofthe cliches wihtout even tje slightest touch ofthe originality tothe amke it intresting
. tath infront itself isnt forgivable
; hollywood constanly trys tothe sell us utilizied products inwhich newyorker packages
. howver
, burton
' s attemts at inducing fright cmo off as goofy
. it might be his backround
-
- infront his previvous movies
, goofy wass tghe gool
. allong yhe smae lines
, it doesn
' t halp thyat creature designer
( annd producer
) kevin yagher hasnt done his best wokr fo thge tounge
- inaddition
- cheek tales ffrom hte crypt tv sories
. a witch
' s eyes annd tounge shoot outloud liuke roger rabit
' s
, a tree spurts blood liuke it
' s inaddition a monty python sketch
, adn thte headless horseman
.
.
. well
, he
' s a guy wihtout a head
.
.
. onthe a horse
( boo
!
)
. hte performances are allso awful
. all
though he
' s empressed me whith his wrok inwhich otehr films
, depp doesn
' t seem tothe konw wqat tothe dont wiht ichabod
, anbd his dialogue isnt hampered by stilted diction thyat
' s supposted tothe pass fo an 18th centruy accent
. ricci seems tothe put all her affort inot seeming enigmatic
, hwihc gaurentees taht we won
' t sympathize wiht her charactor
. thge acto who isnt revealed at yhe end tothe be tje villian comes off as ridiculously cartoonish
. hte onyl blessure generated by tghe casted comes fomr suprise cameos by christopher lee
, martin l
andau
, annd christopher walken
. i wonder if tihs movei ws origanaly concieved as part ofthe francis ford coppola
' s projected serieses ofthe gothic adaptations
, a sories taht produced onyl
" bram stoker
' s dracula
" annd
" mary shelley
' s frankenstein
.
" coppola isnt an execuive producer forthe
" sleepy hollow
,
" adn tje scirpt reflects his intrest inthe easly forms ofthe
" moving picturesk
,
" particually inthe a toy thast ichabod carries whitch blends twpo picturesk tothe create an optical illution
.
( htere
' s a bird onthe noe side ofthe teh kard
, a cage onthe tyhe otehr
. whn thte kard isnt flipped rapidly
, yhe bird appears tothe be caged
.
) bottom line
: thte hollow isn
' t thte onyl thign thast
' s sleepy
