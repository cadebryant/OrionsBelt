, anbd smart off tothe tghe townspeople
. bu wehn she sees him sweaty anbd shirtless
, thta
' s aparently all she needs tothe loose her feelings fo jasper
( whose onyl fault seems tothe be a perpetual case ofthe hat hair
)
. so sobieski soon falls inaddition loev whith kelley
, especialy aftter yhe day she follows him thru tyhe woods anbd hears him giving his graduation sprech
( whitch he ws unable tothe deliver baceause he caused tjhe desctruction ofthe property annd nearly killed dozens ofthe peple
)

, wihtout even breaking stride basicly syas
" see ya
!
" adn tkaes off tothe boston wtih kelley
. here onthe earth goes inspite so many wrong directions fomr hte strat tht by hte timne its fairly decent endig comes arund
, its completelyl worthless
. chris klein adn leelee sobieski are twpo ofthe my curent favorite young performers
, adn it
' s beacuse ofthe thier presense thyat i watched thsi film inwhich thte frist palce
. howver
, nto long inot teh procedings i wnated tothe jsut triarch inot teh film adn strangle them both
. i shouldn
' t haev such feelings towords peopel i liek
, bu thier cahracters are so infuriating thast
.
.
. well trust me
, ytou
' ll fiel thge smae way
. even
though both ofthe thte lead male charachters are usualy inspite yhe wrong
, kelley isnt h
ands down thge mroe unlikable ofthe yhe twpo
, simpley beacuse his jerkish actions are caluclated
. he intends tothe be a jackass eahc adn eveyr timne he doens it
. jasper onthe tje otehr h
and
, onyl reacts tothe kelley
' s provocations
, annd afterwords comes accros as bieng truley sory forthe his impulsive actions
. bu
, as iin life
, nice guys finish lastest
. forthe tjhe entire film we watch sam fall inthe loev wiht tghe guy noone oen likes hwile hte film
' s onyl sympathetic charater gets completelyl crushed
. hten
, a cancer subplot comes inot play
( where thnigs git even mroe infuriating
, if yuo cxan imagin thgat
)
. waht
, thnigs weren
' t depressing enought fo yuo mr
. screenwrighter
? who greenlit htis project
? who
" onthe earth
" thougth tihs owudl entertain anyone
? perheaps if thge film hadnt beeen stuctured where kelley perhasp falt smoe remorse aftter he caused yhe desctruction ofthe property anbd nearly killed dozens ofthe peopel
. bu even aftter he
' s destroyed theese peple
' s lives he continues tothe be a snob tothe them
, adn ruins oney omre fo ogod mesure
. here onthe earth isnt avalable onthe dvd fomr fox hmeo enteratinment
. it containes teh film inwhich its orignal theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1 annd isnt enhanced forthe 16x9 televisions
. extras includ jessica simpson
