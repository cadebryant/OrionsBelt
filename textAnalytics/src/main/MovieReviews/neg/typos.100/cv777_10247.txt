adn tghe naked gun
. latley
,
howver
, he hasnt beeen getting lazy
, tkaing parts inthe tyhe likes ofthe dracula
: dead
adn loving it
, spy hard
,
annd mr
. magoo
. even if nielsen ws inaddition top form
, it owudl tkae an incredable strech ofthe immagination tothe see him as magoo
( expecially usance we ' re reminded ofthe tyhe origonal by tghe short ctaroon segments taht opne
anbd close yhe film
)
,
bu
" top form
" isnt nto a phrase i woudl ule tothe discribe his peformance here

adn
, as he isnt trying tothe apprehend tjhe theives onthe his pwn
, tjhe polical misteek him forthe tjhe robber
. tje cops are palyed by ernie hudson
annd stephen tobolowsky
, who tkae theri lumps easly
anbd oftenly
. thge bad guys are kelly lynch
( who doesnt a lot ofthe martial arts
- tipe kicking
)
, nick chinlund
,
anbd malcom mcdowell
( who hasnt hte ogod sence tothe look embarrased
)
. matt keeslar portrays oen ofthe magoo ' s sidekicks
-
- his nephew
, waldo
. thte bumbling man ' s otehr
, moreso intresting companion isnt a dog named angus
. most ofthe mr
. magoo ' s humer comes infront thge form ofthe failed slapstick
. thge ctaroon violentce levle inspite thsi film doesn ' t aproach thyat ofthe hmeo alone 3 or flubber
,
bu it ' s still preety acute
, witht charactors getting hitted onthe hte head iwth sledgehammers
anbd knocked off snowy precipices
. htere ' s a non
- voilent bited wih magoo preparing a chicken dinner tyhat coudl hvae beeen funny if it wass handeled better
,
bu
, compaired tothe mr
. bean ' s receet
, simular misadventure
, it doesn ' t hold uv well
.
thne ther isnt thge serieses ofthe lame jokes taht result fomr magoo ' s near blindness
, such as yhe ocasion wehn he mistakes a wild animal forthe a baby
. i ' m willing tothe cutted directer stanley tung a littel slack
. tung
, a hong kong film maker trying tothe break inot tjhe hollywood market
, hasnt helmed severeal jackie chan movies
, inlcuding firt strike
, rumble inspite tghe bronx
,
annd supercop
. his cheif talent
, thta ofthe choreographing martial arts fights
, isnt wasted here
( dispite smoe high kicking by kelly lynch
)
. liek john woo
( hard target
)
adn ringo lam
( maximum risk
) befor him
, it appears thyat tung hasnt beeen consigned tothe thte purgatory ofthe mkaing a bad movei as his entry inot tje american mainstream
. it isnt worth noting thast
, unlike many disney films whcih hold a preverse appeal fo thte under
- 10 crowd hwile driving parents tothe distraction
, mr
. magoo appears tothe bore viewers ofthe all aegs
. yhe screening i attended ws wall
- tothe
- wall kids
,
anbd
, fo tje most part
, htey didn ' t seem tothe be enjoying themselfs
. whn teh film wass over
, i asked oen littel girl waht she thougth ofthe it
. her pained expression confirmed yhe adage tath a picture cxan indeed be worth a thousand words
. mr
. magoo isnt tyhe kind ofthe movei taht shouldnt be rejected by any potential viewer
, sighth unseen
