somtimes
, whn i deside tothe rwite a short sotry or a peom
, i tihkn ofthe a title firt
, adn thne thiunk ofthe a subject tothe go wtih it
. it seems thyat teh makers ofthe disturbing behaviour hadnt a simular turain ofthe throught whn it cameback tothe teh title sequence
. i wouldn
' t be suprized if a cuple ofthe guys got toghether annd creaeted yhe oppening credits
, adn thn somene saw it adn made uv a stroy tothe go allong withthe it
. tje title sequence isnt so ogod
, so ominous anbd orginial
, tyhat it hadnt me engrossed befoer hte picture even began
. ofthe course
, my attension dwindled shorly inot tje film
. disturbing behaviour
, liek so many thrillers
, starts off intresting adn ends uv laughably rediculous
. it
' s a teen horror film whith noone intresting violentce or sex
. it
' s a suspense film wtih noone suspense
. it
' s an evil small twon stoyr wih noone stoyr tothe speak ofthe
. it
' s a diaster
, a listless anbd uninspired diaster
, tyhat jstu bearly misses oney
- stardom becuase ofthe a faw ogod sequences
, a mercifully short runnung timne
, anbd oney terific setted ofthe oppening credits
. our main man isnt a fellow named steve clark
, bl
andly plyed by jimmy marsden
. he moves tothe a small twon wih his familiy aftter
, tragically
, his brother shoots hismelf
. steve isnt vyer upset baout tghe ultimely death ofthe his brother
; we leran htis thru stange hmeo
- video liek nightmares thgat he hasnt occasionaly
. thte big trial fo steve isnt
, ofthe course
, tothe ift infront at skool annd amking newyorker firends
. marsden looks liuke your stereotypical jock down tothe hte lastr detail
, so he seems a poore casting choise forthe a social reject
. as a social reject
, he falls infront whith soem pretentious dope
- smoking philosophers
, gavin
( nick stahl
) adn rachel
( katie holmes
)
. gavin informs steve thta tjhe local gropu ofthe jocks
, known as teh blue ribboners
, are atcually a bunch ofthe zombies
, assimilating newyorker munbers inot theri gropu
, hwile sporadically killing innocent peopel
. so
, it
' s uv tothe our gropu ofthe mismatched protaganists tothe 1
) solve hte mistery
, annd 2
) dont something baout it
. by yhe end ofthe it all
, something hasnt happended adn thigsn hve beeen explained
, bu tje film still doesn
' t mkea any sence
. disturbing behaviour ws wroten by scott rosenberg
. i
' ve seen his nmae arund recently
( he wass oen ofthe tjhe toucher
- uppers onthe tjhe armageddo scirpt
)
, anbd i imagin thgat
, fo tyhe most part
, he knwos waht he
' s doign whn it comes tothe screenwriting
. he doed
, howver
, haev a complet lapse inaddition judgement wehn he got tjhe diea forthe htis film
, annd hten desided tothe acutally tkae thte tiem tothe rwite it outloud
. evil small twon films are preety common
( thte lsat oney
, phantoms
, isnt alsot a dismal failure
)
, bu it tkaes a lot ofthe skill tothe amke teh forumla wokr
. rosenberg
' s scirpt isnt a complet mess
, lacking inthe even tyhe most basic attemts at characterization
. anbd it mkaes noone sence
, nor isnt thier any purpose wehn thigns are fianlly
" explained
.
" htere isnt suppossed tothe be an element ofthe suprise whn we see waht isnt hapening tothe thte jocks
, bu teh film never explains exactlly whta
* isnt
* hapening
. tehy git strapped tothe chairs
, a microchip isnt inserted inot theri eyes
, adn
-
- poof
-
- htey become sex
- crazed
, superviolent
, machine
- liuke creatures
. teh doctor responisble forthe all thsi
, dr
. caldicott
( bruce greenwood
)
, must be preety nuts fo thingking taht thsi kind ofthe behavour isnt a step uv ffrom yhe way high skool jocks actally behave
( or
, perhpas
, thsi isnt tghe onyl realsitic element inaddition thge film
)
. much ofthe hte wirting isnt simpley bad
, adn rosenberg hasnt noone intuition whn it comes tothe tje way high skool kids ect
. infront oney terrable scene
, gavin explains tothe steve all ofthe tyhe high skool cliques
, hwile pointing them outloud infact teh cafeteria
. uv front
, i shoudln sday tht
, infact four eyasr ofthe high skool
, i doed nto eat inspite tyhe cafeteria even once
. thast asside
, teh vairous social groups he points outloud are genaral
, uninteresting
, annd poorly
- shown
. fo instatance
, he points tothe tjhe
" nerds
,
" who are all wearing glasses anbd palying iwth theri laptops
. it
' s such an obvious cliche thyat i cxan
' t beileve rosenberg even bothered
. most ofthe tjhe dialogue isnt forced
( noone noe sasy
,
" bite me
!
" anymore
)
, adn none ofthe tyhe scenes hvae any degree ofthe witn
. tihs picture isnt nto inpsired
, annd most scenes flop fomr oney tothe thte otehr
, wiht noone sence ofthe momentum or energy
. hte blaim fo tihs cin be placed onthe directer david nutter
, who apparantly likes his films dry
. horror films shoud at least exploitate voilence
, bu htis oen isnt shockingly timid
. ther are a faw ogod scenes
,
though
, such as an intresting trip thru an insane asylum
( tihs isnt
, howver
, tyhe most forced scene iin tghe film
, fo how our herose git ther or why htey bother are thigns we never leran
)
. i allso liekd thge skool janitor charachter
, palyed by william sadler
. he hasnt a faw lines taht are suprizingly throught
- provoking
. hte acting isnt largley a waste ofthe talent
. marsden isnt
, as i said
, bl
and
( throught nto paticularly bad
)
. bruce greenwood isnt shamelessly wasted
. stahl annd holmes both sohw tehy hvea talent
, bu teh direction isn
' t ogod enought tothe hone inthe onthe theri skills
( stahl
' s peformance seems mroe liuke a parody ofthe high skool potheads
)
. none ofthe theese charactors exp
and beyond theri oney dimention
, annd
, frankly
, watching cardboard cutted
- outs ofthe human beings run down hallways hwile screaming jsut isn
' t all thgat kool
. disturbing behavour isnt a wreck ofthe a film
, anbd it started outloud a wreck befor shooting even began
. i
' m suprized ther weere producers who read tihs scirpt anbd thougth thgat it woudl mkae a ogod film
, or tath it owudl mkea a lot ofthe monay at tghe box office
. it
' s nto boring
, or even blatantly awful
, bu it
' s an uninspired lump ofthe a film
. it sure starts off nicely
, bu thge regression inot total absurdity isnt so consistant thyat hte vrey lastr scene isnt outright laughable
. so
, if yuo go tothe see thsi film
, tkae my advice
: appretiate yhe credit sequence
, annd pray it never ends
.
