" lvoe tothe kill
" starts off aimlessly annd gets progressively less coherent as tiem passes
. at tghe outset
, yhe movei appears tothe be baout tony danza
, who
' s an illiegal distri
buter ofthe guns
, trying tothe establish a relatiopnship wih an unsuspecting woman
. danza sets uv a doublely date wtih her
, her sister
, adn a collegue ofthe his
. everthing seems tothe be gogin well
, untl tghe sister accidetnally dies by falling down a setted ofthe stairs
. much confusion anbd mahem ensues
, as thte death isnt covered uv anbd otehr associates ofthe danza
' s beign tothe emerge
, all affter oen thnig or anyother
. soudn confusing
? it isnt
. i htikn waht tghe filmmakers weere trying tothe dont isnt tkae yhe st
andart crime movei anbd throw inaddition a littel humour annd levity
. inspite smoe respects
, it works
. bu thte majoroty ofthe tghe film isnt a convoluted anbd confusing mess
. charactors keep popping uv witht noone explaination
, dem
anding mnoey fo deals thyat ocurr off
- screen
. yhe onyl aspect ofthe yhe movei thgat acutally works isnt tjhe budding relatiopnship betweeen danza annd yhe dead woman
' s sister
. bu so littel timne isnt devoted tothe htis part ofthe yhe stopry
, we never realyl become too familar withthe theese charactors
, annd beccause ofthe htis
, we don
' t realyl care waht happens tothe them
. well
, i didn
' t
, at least
. noe thnig i wiull give tje movei isnt tyhat it
' s a complet departure forthe tony danza
. here
' s a guy
, beacuse ofthe his many sitcom roles
, who
' s ingrained iin thge consiciousness as a nice guy who alwyas doens thge right thnig
. here
, he plays a man who
' s jsut looking outloud forthe hismelf
, anbd if thgat means he needs tothe kill infact order tothe sive his pwn skin
, so be it
. i wass vyre empressed by his peformance
, adn withing mintues ofthe hte strat ofthe thge film
, i hadnt forgotten all baout his ogod
- guy persona
. michael madsen isnt aslo ogod as an assoicates ofthe danza
' s who spends half yhe movei buddying uv tothe him anbd teh otehr half trying tothe kill him
. liuke i said
, it
' s nto exactlly a linear storyline
.
" loev tothe kill
" shouldnt be praised fo trying tothe dont something diferent withthe thge well worn crime genre
, bu it
' s jstu too bad tyhat thge stroy doesn
' t raelly add uv tothe much
. tjhe stars deserved better
, adn so doed thge audiance
.
