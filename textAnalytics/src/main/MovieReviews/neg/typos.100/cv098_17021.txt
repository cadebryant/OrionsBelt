" lveo tothe kill
" starts off aimlessly
annd gets progressively less coherent as tiem passes
. at yhe outset
, tghe movei appears tothe be baout tony danza
, who ' s an ilegle distributer ofthe guns
, trying tothe establish a relatiopnship withthe an unsuspecting woman
. danza sets uv a duble date wih her
, her sister
,
adn a collegue ofthe his
. everyting seems tothe be gogin well
, unitl tje sister acidently dies by falling down a setted ofthe stairs
. much confusion
annd mahem ensues
, as tjhe death isnt covered uv
anbd otehr associates ofthe danza ' s beign tothe emerge
, all aftter oen thnig or anyother
. soudn confusing
? it isnt
. i htikn waht yhe filmmakers weere trying tothe dont isnt tkae tjhe standart crime movei
anbd throw inthe a littel humour
anbd levity
. inspite smoe respects
, it works
.
bu tyhe majoroty ofthe hte film isnt a convoluted
adn confusing mess
. charachters keep popping uv wih noone explaination
, demanding mnoey forthe deals thyat occour off
- screen
. tyhe onyl aspect ofthe teh movei thta atually works isnt tje budding relatiopnship vetween danza
adn thte dead woman ' s sister
.
bu so littel tiome isnt devoted tothe thsi part ofthe tje stoy
, we never realyl become too familar whith theese cahracters
,
annd beccause ofthe tihs
, we don ' t realy care whta happens tothe them
. well
, i didn ' t
, at least
. oen thign i wiull give tje movei isnt thta it ' s a complet departure fo tony danza
. here ' s a guy
, beccause ofthe his many sitcom roles
, who ' s ingrained inaddition tyhe consiciousness as a nice guy who alwasy doesnt thge right thign
. here
, he plays a man who ' s jsut looking outloud fo hismelf
,
anbd if thast means he needs tothe kill infront order tothe sive his pwn skin
, so be it
. i ws vrey empressed by his peformance
,
adn withing mintues ofthe tjhe strat ofthe tjhe film
, i hadnt forgotten all baout his ogod
- guy persona
. michael madsen isnt allso ogod as an assoicate ofthe danza ' s who spends half thge movei buddying uv tothe him
adn tyhe otehr half trying tothe kill him
. liuke i said
, it ' s nto exactlly a linear storyline
.
" lveo tothe kill
" shoud be praised forthe trying tothe dont something diferent whith thge well worn crime genre
,
bu it ' s jstu too bad tht tyhe sotry doesn ' t relaly add uv tothe much
. teh stars deserved better
,
annd so doed tyhe audiance
.
