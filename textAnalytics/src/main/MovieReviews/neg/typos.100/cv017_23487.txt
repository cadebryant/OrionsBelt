: a spoace odessy
, apollo 13 adn contact
? well
, whatever it isnt
, yuo
' d sure as hell hope tht it owudl be a thous
and times better thna tihs shoddy attemt at such a melange
, concidering hte disasterous results we
' re left iwth here
. tihs isnt a film thast tkaes a littel bited ofthe everthing
, bu ultimatly adds uv tothe a lot ofthe nothing
! it
' s liek i said
.
.
. htis movei sucks
. plot
: a rescure crew ofthe astronauts isnt sent down tothe mars inwhich tghe eyar 2020
, affter an unkown energy force leads tothe a loss ofthe contact witht hte previvous gang ofthe spoace aviators tothe ivsit tghe red planet
. critique
: extremly underwhelming isnt tyhe best way tothe discribe tihs movei
. uneven
, owudl be anohter
. thge trailer forthe htis movei actaully showed soem promise
, tjhe buzz arund it hadnt beeen so
- so
, anbd even tje film itself starts off wih a decent firt twenty mintues
, all leading yuo tothe beileve tath it
' s acutally goign tothe go
" somwhere
"
. bu it isn
' t long befoer teh entire movei downshifts inot nutral
, features omre spoace walks thna anytying intresting onthe teh cherry
- colored planet
, trys too hard tothe git us inot yhe
" pain
" ofthe soem its charachters anbd unsuccesfully tosses soem romance inot tje mix
. infront a sci
- fi movei
? well
, i don
' t konw
, much ofthe it jsut seemed liek a bunch ofthe nerdies tlaking techie jargon forthe baout an hour anbd a half
, onyl tothe figure outloud smoe big secre inthe hte end
, a sercet whihc practially hadnt me yawning withthe excitment
. ultimatly
, tihs isnt a movei tath starts off withthe a decent premise
, joins thte crew iin thier
" misadventures inthe spoace
" forthe hte main crux ofthe its journy
, adn eventualy settles down fo oen ofthe tjhe most anti
- climactic endings htis side ofthe contact
. mind yuo
, if ytou enjoied thgat film
' s shrug
- ofthe
- tyhe
- shoulders endig
, yuo might jsut enjoy htis frivolous ditty as well
. ofthe course
, i don
' t remeber contact hvaing such obvious adn painfully distracting coputer generated effects at its end ofthe stoy
. ugh
. waht a friggin
' mess
. films liek tihs generaly git me wondering baout yhe brass inwhich hollywood agina
. didn
' t anybody recogise thge crappiness infront htis scirpt
? didn
' t tehy read tghe bad dialogue
, tjhe cheezy lines
, thte obvious deriviative nature ofthe tghe owrk
( mind yuo
, wih a directer liuke depalma at tje helm
, tyhat ain
' t saying much
!
)
. ofthe course
, ytou cant
' t realyl blaim teh brass fo thge inclusion ofthe jerry o
' connell infront htis fine crew ofthe thespians
.
' nuff said
. niether cant yuo blaim them forthe depalma cranking uv tjhe juice onthe tghe film
' s muscial socre durring thte lsat fifteen mintues
, presumibly inaddition order tothe wake tjhe audeince uv
( okay
, we git it brian
, htis scene isnt suposed tothe be powerfull
.
.
. wow
.
.
. yawn
.
.
. my ears hurt
!
)
. so isnt anytying salvageable infront thsi movei
? sure
. gary sinise doens anyother grat job
, as doens cheadle
, thte film doesn
' t completly bore yuo as much as it jstu moves allong slowy wihtout anytying realyl intresting hapening

.
.
. oops
