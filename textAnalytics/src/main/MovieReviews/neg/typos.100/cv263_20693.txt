. greeting him isnt his ood freind anbd partner iin crime
( palyed by danny aiello
)
, who becomes hte subject ofthe many amusing fat jokes
. theese are rether welcome inwhich a movei filled iwth so many completly unfunny sighth gags
, cartoonish villains anbd unbeleivable coincidences
. it appears as if directer lehmann didn
' t knwo wehn tothe stpo all teh absurd silliness
, annd he piles onthe layer aftter layer ofthe utter ridiculousness as tjhe movei propels itself towrad tyhe finish line
. if at soem point durring hudson hawk yuo mkea tyhe assumption taht thnigs couldn

andable tothe see willis annd aiello inwhich a movei ofthe thsi calibur

' m nto entirely sure
. coburn plays a fromer nemesis ofthe yhe hawk who agina comes inot play
, annd he looks unsure ofthe his palce tghe entire movei
. especialy whn he resorts tothe martial arts durring tyhe fianl showdown
, adn hasnt a fight whith willis thta owudl look right at hmeo infront a jackie chan film
