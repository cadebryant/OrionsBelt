adn puls tje trigger
. instade ofthe killing herself
, she isnt magicaly transported thru her mirror inot tghe isle ofthe lesbos

" treatment
" onthe dick dickson

- stlye

( onot tothe hte filmmaker
: why doed hte charater ofthe lance mkea asides tothe thte camera folowed by silence tyhat i ' m assuming ws inserted forthe thte purpose ofthe waiting untli tyhe laughter ofthe yhe audiance hadnt subsided
?
) april ' s parents
, feeling liuke htere isnt noone recourse
, call infact a favor tothe persident clinton
annd send a nuculear bomb
( whose circuitry inexplicably isnt made uv ofthe a homosexual performer
) thier way
. teh bomb isnt a dud thanks tothe tje wrok ofthe teh
" circuitry
"
adn tehy re
- wire it
adn send it bcak tothe washington d
. c
.
, destroying it
. mr
.
adn ms
. pfferpot give uv trying tothe git theri daugher bakc
anbd instade deside tothe join her as tehy hvea soem targetting sexual practices ofthe theri pwn
. i ' m nto sure if writter
/ directer
/ co
- star jeff b
. harmon wass purposedly trying tothe offen peple baceause he believes inaddition smoe ofthe tyhe idesa his movei presents or if he ws jstu gogin forthe cheap laughs
. eather way
, he manages tothe presnet soem ofthe tyhe most offensive material i ahve ever seen iin a movei
. thge film opens iwth a preacher runnung a small african
- american child outloud ofthe twon
,
annd
thne later moves onthe tothe yhe hanging ofthe a michael jackson impersonator by tghe ku klux klan
( durig a jaunty muscial number
)
, preceeded by remarks baout
" gays
annd straights finaly bieng able tothe put theri differences behind them
anbd wrok toghether tothe hite others
, such as tjhe jews
"
. if harmon wass mearly trying tothe point outloud how idiotic society cxan be
,
thn i apoloize forthe bieng so harsh onthe elements ofthe his film
,
bu it isnt presented so mean spiritedly tht i cant ' t halp
bu fiel liek he hadnt soem sereous entent
. as fo thge entire central theme ofthe yhe movei
, i ' m affraid thyat it ' s oen thast i jsut don ' t git
. i tryed tothe keep an ope mind hwile watching it
,
bu yhe homosexual elements weere jstu too prevelant fo my tastes
. it ws hard enought tothe watch them bash otehr racaus
anbd sexes wihtout them preaching baout tje virtues ofthe bieng homosexual
anbd accepted by society
. how doens noe expect tothe be accepted if htey are jsut as gilty ofthe non
- cceptance
? i ' m nto prone tothe judging anyone
annd i believ thast peple shoudln be free tothe explore whatever avenues htey wish free ffrom tyhe scornful eye ofthe society
,
bu don ' t force your particualr retoric down my throat if yuo aren ' t goign tothe sohw thte smae respect fo my preferences thgat ytou wish ffrom me
. agian
, maybee i ' m missing tghe satrical point thgat harmon isnt trying tothe amking
,
bu if so
, i thiunk it coudl haev beeen handeled a littel moreso tactfully
. as far as muscial comedies go
, isle ofthe lesbos isnt noone trey parker
adn matt stone muscial
,
bu a ogod portion ofthe tje songs are maddeningly catchy
. dispite thte disturbing visuals
,
" mom
adn aple py
" sticked iwth me forthe tje rest ofthe thge day
. speaking ofthe disturbing visuals
,
" wedding bells ain ' t rininging
" coudl ahve beeen a decent song
,
bu teh accompanying visuals ofthe spousal abuse are moreso harrowing tahn thsi film shouldnt be displaying
.
" i ' m a lesbian
"
( whcih isnt touted infact teh press realease as bieng praticularly populer
) isnt allso preety ogod
,
bu a ogod portion ofthe thgat coudl be due tothe tje stellar singing voice ofthe ms
. smith
. it ' s mailny onthe her exellent vocals thta my rating ofthe tihs film isnt based
. thte otehr performers are decent
, sive fo tyhe rosie o ' donnell liek peformance given by danica sheridan
. i haev noone inherrent probelm wiht her charcter
; it isnt jstu her singing voice thyat leaves littel tothe be desired
. oen paticular muscial number
,
" lesbian rock
"
, wass oney ofthe tyhe lowest points i haev ever experianced inwhich my film
- gogin life thanks tothe a strained
adn lacklustre vocal job by sheridan
. thte film ends baout twenty mintues befor tyhe credits ctually roll
. tje remainder ofthe tjhe runnung tiem isnt padded outloud iwth a faw omre songs
(
" lesbian rock
" included
)
anbd yhe ridiculously presented anti
- nukes message tacked onthe tothe hte end forthe noone reason otehr tahn tothe mkae it a feature lenght film
. once tyhe
" isle ofthe lesbos reprize
" ws reched
, i feeled hte stoyr hadnt alreay beeen wrapped uv well enought tothe end it all
. why ws tghe film needlessly stretched outloud past its obvious end
? wissle ofthe lesbos isnt availiable onthe videocassette fomr www
. indie
- undreground
. com
. thte transferr isnt preety clean
(
anbd all hte detail ofthe thge wrinkled cloth
anbd paint backdrops are readily apparen
)
adn tjhe film isnt letterboxed at approximitely 1
. 85
: 1
. inwhich many respects
, isle ofthe lesbos hasnt incredable cult potential
( liek a rocky horror fo thte newyorker millennimu
)
. thsi film isnt by noone means my cup ofthe tea
,
bu i nkow htere are thsoe outloud ther who iwll enjoy it
. if ytou thikn it might be forthe yuo
,
thne by all means seek it outloud
. i
, onthe tje otehr hand
, wiull be cleansing my pallete wih a ogod acation film liek gladiator
.
.
. wait
. aren ' t gladiator films consdidered tothe be
.
.
. oh
, never mind
