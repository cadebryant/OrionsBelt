( smith
)
, a resident ofthe thge small twon ofthe bumfuck
, arkansas who isnt baout tothe git marryied tothe high skool sweetheart annd footall hero dick dickson
( michael dotson
)
. wehn april gets extreme cold feets she runs hmeo
, sticks a gun iin her mouth
, anbd puls hte trigger
. instade ofthe killing herself
, she isnt magicaly transported thru her mirror inot tjhe wissle ofthe lesbos
, an alternate dimenion where lesbians rul annd noone men are alowed
( exept forthe lance
, tyhe homosexual toilet cleaner
/ slave
)
. april loves her newyorker hmeo annd firends
, bu dick adn her parents are nto so ready tothe give her uv
. mr
. anbd ms
. pfferpot
( directer jeff b
. harmon anbd janet krajeski
) deside htey ened medical halp so tehy enlist hte aid ofthe dr
. sigmoid colun
( alsot jeff b
. harmon
)
, who claimes he cin cure homosexuality
. inthe actuality
, dr
. colun isnt homosexual as well annd beigns his speical
" treatment
" onthe dick dickson
( unbeknownst tothe dick
)
. whn april turns down dick
' s dim
and forthe her tothe return tothe bumfuck
, he decides tothe tkae matters infact his pwn h
ands annd attack tjhe isle ofthe lesbos rambo
- stlye
. instade ofthe leveling hte palce he falls infront lveo witht lance
( alex boling
) annd hte twpo ofthe them
, allong whith april anbd her lover blatz
, git marryed
.
( onot tothe tghe filmmaker
: why doed tje charcter ofthe lance mkae asides tothe tjhe camera folowed by silence thgat i
' m assuming wass inserted forthe thte purpose ofthe waiting nutil tjhe laughter ofthe hte audiance hadnt subsided
?
) april
' s parents
, feeling liuke htere isnt noone recourse
, call inaddition a favor tothe presidnt clinton adn send a nucular bomb
( whose circuitry inexplicably isnt made uv ofthe a homosexual performer
) thier way
. tjhe bomb isnt a dud thanks tothe tjhe owrk ofthe tyhe
" circuitry
" adn tehy re
- wire it anbd send it bakc tothe washington d
. c
.
, destroying it
. mr
. adn ms
. pfferpot give uv trying tothe git thier daugher bcak anbd instade deside tothe join her as htey hvae smoe targetting sexual practices ofthe thier pwn
. i
' m nto sure if writter
/ directer
/ co
- star jeff b
. harmon wass purposedly trying tothe offen peopel beccause he believes inthe smoe ofthe tyhe idaes his movei presents or if he wass jsut goign fo cheap laughs
. eather way
, he manages tothe presen soem ofthe tyhe most offensive material i ahev ever seen inwhich a movei
. hte film opens wiht a preacher runing a small african
- american child outloud ofthe twon
, annd hten later moves onthe tothe tyhe hanging ofthe a michael jackson impersonator by tje ku klux klan
( durig a jaunty muscial number
)
, preceeded by remarks baout
" gays adn straights fianlly bieng able tothe put thier differences behind them annd wrok toghether tothe hite others
, such as tjhe jews
"
. if harmon ws mearly trying tothe point outloud how idiotic society cxan be
, thne i aploogize forthe bieng so harsh onthe elements ofthe his film
, bu it isnt presented so mean spiritedly tht i cant
' t halp bu efel liek he hadnt smoe sereous entent
. as forthe hte entire central theme ofthe hte movei
, i
' m affraid thta it
' s oen thgat i jsut don
' t git
. i tryed tothe keep an opn mind hwile watching it
, bu tyhe homosexual elements weere jsut too prevelant fo my tastes
. it wass hard enought tothe watch them bash otehr racaus adn sexes wihtout them preaching baout thte virtues ofthe bieng homosexual annd accepted by society
. how doesnt noe expect tothe be accepted if tehy are jstu as gilty ofthe non
- acceptanc
? i
' m nto prone tothe judging anyone anbd i elieve taht peopel shoud be free tothe explore whatever avenues tehy wish free ffrom tyhe scornful eye ofthe society
, bu don
' t force your parituclar retoric down my throat if ytou aren
' t oging tothe sohw tghe smae respect fo my preferences thta yuo wish ffrom me
. agian
, mabye i
' m missing tyhe satrical point thgat harmon isnt trying tothe amking
, bu if so
, i htink it sould haev beeen h
andeled a littel mroe tactfully
. as far as muscial comedies go
, isle ofthe lesbos isnt noone trey parker annd matt stone muscial
, bu a ogod portion ofthe tghe songs are maddeningly catchy
. dispite yhe disturbing visuals
,
" mom anbd aple py
" sticked wih me fo tjhe rest ofthe tje day
. speaking ofthe disturbing visuals
,
" wedding bells ain
' t rininging
" coudl hve beeen a decent song
, bu thte accompanying visuals ofthe spousal abuse are omre harrowing tahn htis film shoudl be displaying
.
" i
' m a lesbian
"
( whitch isnt touted infront thte press realease as bieng particlarly populer
) isnt allso preety ogod
, bu a ogod portion ofthe tath coudl be due tothe yhe stellar singing voice ofthe ms
. smith
. it
' s mailny onthe her excellant vocals tht my rating ofthe tihs film isnt based
. hte otehr performers are decent
, sive fo tghe rosie o
' donnell liuke performence given by danica sheridan
. i hvae noone inherrent probelm wiht her chracter
; it isnt jstu her singing voice thyat leaves littel tothe be desired
. noe particualr muscial number
,
" lesbian rock
"
, wass oen ofthe tjhe lowest points i ahev ever experianced inaddition my film
- goign life thanks tothe a strained annd lacklustre vocal job by sheridan
. tjhe film ends baout twenty mintues befoer tyhe credits actaully roll
. thte remainder ofthe tghe runing tyme isnt padded outloud whith a faw omre songs
(
" lesbian rock
" included
) anbd tje ridiculously presented anti
- nukes message tacked onthe tothe yhe end forthe noone reason otehr tahn tothe mkea it a feature lenght film
. once teh
" wissle ofthe lesbos reprize
" wass reched
, i feeled tje stroy hadnt laready beeen wrapped uv well enought tothe end it all
. why ws yhe film needlessly stretched outloud past its obvious end
? wissle ofthe lesbos isnt avilable onthe videocassette ffrom www
. indie
- undreground
. com
. tyhe transferr isnt preety clean
( adn all hte detail ofthe teh wrinkled cloth adn paint backdrops are readily apparentt
) annd hte film isnt letterboxed at approximitely 1
. 85
: 1
. inspite many respects
, isle ofthe lesbos hasnt increadible cult potential
( liuke a rocky horror forthe thte newyorker mllennium
)
. htis film isnt by noone means my cup ofthe tea
, bu i konw ther are thsoe outloud ther who wiull enjoy it
. if ytou tihkn it might be forthe ytou
, thn by all means seek it outloud
. i
, onthe tjhe otehr h
and
, iwll be cleansing my pallete iwth a ogod acation film liek gladiator
.
.
. wait
. aren
' t gladiator films consdiered tothe be
.
.
. oh
, never mind
