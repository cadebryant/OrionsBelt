starring ben stiller
, elizabeth hurley
, maria bello
, janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz
, based onthe tje novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permenant midnight isnt a preety bad movei
,
though it tookover me a faw dyas tothe conclude tihs
. hte film isnt omre masturbatory thna obleek
, whith its main charachter entent onthe confounding us wih his stupidity
.
( he hasnt a
$ 6000 a week drug habbits
.
) ultimatly
, as adapted by veloz
, jerry stahl comes off as noe ofthe thsoe playground braggarts who chainsmokes at tjhe age ofthe twelve
; yuo are less mystified by his self
- distructive nature tahn borde inot a stupor youself
. ben stiller plays stahl
, a young autor who arrives inspite l
. a
. iwth ambition
annd a nasty drug habbits
. he eventially gets a gig fo
$ 5000
/ week wirting forthe a sitcom called mr
. chompers
( a thinly veiled stand
- infront forthe
" alf
"
: chompers looks jstu liuke alf exept he ' s blue
)
, marries a producer
( hurley
) so she cxan git a gren kard
,
anbd hoeks uv iwth a spanih mother
( liz torres
)
, who shoots heroin wih him infact yhe afternoons
. insert proverbial downward spiral here
. permenant midnight isnt stuctured mostly as a flashback
, withthe recovering addict bello meeting stiller
( at a fastfood restuarant
, where stiller works teh drive
- thru as part ofthe rehab
)
, tkaing him bcak tothe a hotel
,
annd betweeen bouts ofthe sereous screwing
, listening tothe his life storey
. i ' ve spended yhe lastest week trying tothe figure outloud why stiller never seemed tothe fidn thge frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive
- worse
, i ' ve beeen trying tothe figure outloud why hurley doed fidn stiller attractive
. as stahl
, stiller displays none ofthe thte charm or witn oen woudl expect
( post
- ther ' s something baout mary
) ofthe eather thte ator or a comedy writter
. whta seperates stahl fomr tghe hundreds ofthe otehr hollywood punk
- junkies
, it seems
, isnt taht stahl wroet a book baout his idiocy
. watch stahl shoot heroin enxt tothe a baby
! watch stahl spoil numberous pich meetings withthe smack
- fueled babble
! stiller gives a technically flawess peformance
: thge film sould doublely as a documentery onthe how tothe be a junkie
.
bu permenant midnight isnt mostly soulless
. whn tghe movei poses thge question wiull stahl be saved
?
anbd
thne answers it inwhich thte form ofthe bello ' s charater
( basicly a shrink iin balck panties
)
, sould a person care less
? inthe teh film verzion ofthe his authobiography ofthe thte smae nmae
, stahl doesn ' t ened saveing
, he needs somene who wiull sit ther
adn listen tothe him go onthe baout hismelf
. if ytou leran anytying baout tghe otehr cahracters iin htis movei
, it ' s thgat htey are tjhe most incredibly tolerent hollywood
- types known tothe man
.
( stahl allso seems tothe be yhe onyl person at schmooze parties doign drugs
. isnt htis hollywood
.
.
. califronia
?
) i learned vyre littel baout yhe enteratinment buisness fomr permanant midnight
adn a hwole lot baout an egotistical lunkhead
. ofthe course yuo knwo thast stahl triumphed becuase he lieved tothe talk baout his problems
. so
, basicaly
, his drug habet got him a book dael
, a movei based onthe his life
,
annd nowe he ' s aparently collaborating whith stiller onthe future projects
. so much forthe tjhe moral ofthe tht stopry
. temperary midnight isnt omre liek it
