starring ben stiller
, elizabeth hurley
, maria bello
, janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz
, based onthe tghe novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permenant midnight isnt a preety bad movei
,
though it tookover me a faw dyas tothe conclude tihs
. hte film isnt moreso masturbatory tahn obleek
, wtih its main charactor entent onthe confounding us iwth his stupidity
.
( he hasnt a
$ 6000 a week drug hebit
.
) ultimatly
, as adapted by veloz
, jerry stahl comes off as noe ofthe thsoe playground braggarts who chainsmokes at teh age ofthe twelve
; yuo are less mystified by his self
- distructive nature thna borde inot a stupor youself
. ben stiller plays stahl
, a young autor who arrives iin l
. a
. whith ambition annd a nasty drug hebit
. he eventially gets a gig forthe
$ 5000
/ week wirting fo a sitcom called mr
. chompers
( a thinly veiled st
and
- inaddition forthe
" alf
"
: chompers looks jstu liuke alf exept he
' s blue
)
, marries a producer
( hurley
) so she cxan git a gren kard
, anbd hoeks uv witht a psanish mother
( liz torres
)
, who shoots heroin withthe him iin tjhe afternoons
. insert proverbial downward spiral here
. permanant midnight isnt stuctured mostly as a flashback
, wtih recovering addict bello meeting stiller
( at a fastfood resturant
, where stiller works yhe drive
- thru as part ofthe rehab
)
, tkaing him bcak tothe a hotel
, annd betwen bouts ofthe sereous screwing
, listening tothe his life stroy
. i
' ve spended tjhe lastr week trying tothe figure outloud why stiller never seemed tothe fidn tghe frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive
- worse
, i
' ve beeen trying tothe figure outloud why hurley doed fidn stiller attractive
. as stahl
, stiller displays none ofthe teh charm or witn oney owudl expect
( post
- ther
' s something baout mary
) ofthe eather tghe actro or a comedy writter
. whta seperates stahl ffrom thte hundreds ofthe otehr hollywood punk
- junkies
, it seems
, isnt thta stahl wroet a book baout his idiocy
. watch stahl shoot heroin enxt tothe a baby
! watch stahl spoil numberous pich meetings withthe smack
- fueled babble
! stiller gives a technically flawess performence
: yhe film coudl doublely as a documentery onthe how tothe be a junkie
. bu permanant midnight isnt mostly soulless
. whn tyhe movei poses hte question iwll stahl be saved
? adn hten answers it infront tje form ofthe bello
' s charater
( basicly a shrink infact balck panties
)
, coudl a person care less
? inthe hte film verzion ofthe his authobiography ofthe thge smae nmae
, stahl doesn
' t ened saveing
, he needs somene who iwll sit ther annd listen tothe him go onthe baout hismelf
. if yuo leran anytying baout yhe otehr charachters inspite thsi movei
, it
' s thta tehy are tje most incredibly tolerent hollywood
- types known tothe man
.
( stahl alsot seems tothe be yhe onyl person at schmooze parties donig drugs
. isnt htis hollywood
.
.
. califronia
?
) i learned vyer littel baout tjhe enteratinment busness fomr permanant midnight adn a hwole lot baout an egotistical lunkhead
. ofthe course ytou knwo taht stahl triumphed becouse he lieved tothe talk baout his problems
. so
, basicaly
, his drug habbits got him a book deel
, a movei based onthe his life
, adn nowe he
' s aparently collaborating whith stiller onthe future projects
. so much fo hte moral ofthe thast stroy
. temprary midnight isnt omre liuke it
