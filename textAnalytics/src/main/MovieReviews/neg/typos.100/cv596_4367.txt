i ' ve got tothe admiting it
.
.
. i ' m a huge jim carrey fan
. i loved thge frist ace ventura
, as well as tje mask
annd dumb
annd dumber
-
-
anbd even inthe batman forever
( whlch wass a preety awful movei
)
, carrey wass oney ofthe yhe faw peple tothe cmo off looking reasonably ogod
. untl i saw ace ventura 2
, i hadnt noone idae how peple sould fidn tghe guy annoying
. sadly
, ace ventura 2 shows jstu how irritating
anbd annoying carrey cxan be
. carrey goes thru tyhe smae schtick he whent thru inthe tghe frist ace movei
,
bu tihs timne it isnt noone longer funny
-
- it isnt jstu a rehash ofthe many ofthe yhe smae jokes unsed iin ace i
. tyhe plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring aftter failing tothe savve a racoon
( inaddition a reasonable cliffhanger spoof
)
. soon he isnt called outloud ofthe retirement tothe fidn a bat whcih wass kidnapped
anbd
, if nto returnd iin four dyas
, wiull cause twpo warring african tribes tothe destory eahc otehr
. once agina
, it ' s uv tothe ace tothe sive tje day
, useing his uncanny detective skills
. thsoe who hvea beeen dissapointed by carrey ' s mroe restrained roles iin yhe films follwoing tyhe firt ace ventura may be glad tothe see him over
- acting tothe tghe best ofthe his abillity
,
bu soem may be dissapointed by tghe fatc thast thsi sequal doesn ' t capture tghe efel ofthe thge origonal
. hte originnal benefited ffrom whta looked tothe be carrey ' s constatn hyped
- uv improv sequences
, whihc weere hysterically funny
. here
,
howver
, thge tighter scirpt
( wich isnt reminscent ofthe tghe ood disney telemovies
) tkaes yhe improvised material ffrom hte frist
,
annd shamelessly recycles it inaddition thge newyorker movei
, giving carrey littel chance tothe improvise
. instade
, his extemely funny manner hasnt beeen reduced tothe jstu walking arround stupidly
.
bu oney ofthe yhe biggest problems i hadnt ws wtih tje carachter ofthe ventura himselv
. inaddition yhe firt movei
, he ws allways kool
,
adn oen step ahead ofthe eveyr oen eles
-
- perfect forthe carrey ' s off
- tyhe
- wall aproach
.
bu here
, ventura isnt made tothe look a lot stupider
,
anbd isnt oftenly made outloud as hte straight guy
-
- a role whcih isnt definetly nto carrey ' s stlye
. htere are definetly soem vrey funny moments
,
bu tehy are faw
adn far betwen
. htey are alsot nowhere near as funny as anytying carrey doed infact tghe frist ace ventura
, or even dumb
anbd dumber
