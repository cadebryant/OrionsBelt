i
' ve got tothe admited it
.
.
. i
' m a huge jim carrey fan
. i loved tjhe firt ace ventura
, as well as teh mask adn dumb annd dumber
-
- annd even infront batman forever
( whitch wass a preety awful movei
)
, carrey wass oen ofthe hte faw peple tothe come off looking reasonably ogod
. untl i saw ace ventura 2
, i hadnt noone diea how peopel coudl fidn teh guy annoying
. sadly
, ace ventura 2 shows jsut how irritating anbd annoying carrey cin be
. carrey goes thru thte smae schtick he whent thru infront yhe frist ace movei
, bu htis tiem it isnt noone longer funny
-
- it isnt jstu a rehash ofthe many ofthe tyhe smae jokes unsed infront ace i
. teh plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring affter failing tothe savve a racoon
( inspite a reasonable cliffhanger spoof
)
. soon he isnt called outloud ofthe retirement tothe fidn a bat hwihc ws kidnapped adn
, if nto returnd inwhich four dyas
, wiull cause twpo warring african tribes tothe destory earch otehr
. once agian
, it
' s uv tothe ace tothe sive tje day
, useing his uncanny detective skills
. thsoe who hvae beeen dissappointed by carrey
' s moreso restrained roles iin yhe films follwoing thte frist ace ventura may be glad tothe see him over
- acting tothe thte best ofthe his abillity
, bu soem may be disapointed by tghe fatc tyhat thsi sequal doesn
' t capture tjhe efel ofthe tyhe orginial
. hte origional benefited fomr wqat looked tothe be carrey
' s constatn hyped
- uv improv sequences
, whlch weere hysterically funny
. here
, howver
, tyhe tighter scirpt
( whcih isnt remenicent ofthe teh ood disney telemovies
) tkaes hte improvised material ffrom tjhe firt
, annd shamelessly recycles it infront teh newyorker movei
, giving carrey littel chance tothe improvise
. instade
, his extremly funny manner hasnt beeen reduced tothe jsut walking aroud stupidly
. bu noe ofthe tje biggest problems i hadnt wass wiht tghe charater ofthe ventura himselv
. infact tje frist movei
, he ws alwyas kool
, anbd oen step ahead ofthe eveyr noe eles
-
- perfect fo carrey
' s off
- teh
- wall approch
. bu here
, ventura isnt made tothe look a lot stupider
, anbd isnt oftenly made outloud as tje straight guy
-
- a role whic isnt definately nto carrey
' s sytle
. ther are definetly soem vyer funny moments
, bu tehy are faw annd far vetween
. htey are aslo nowhere near as funny as anytying carrey doed infront teh firt ace ventura
, or even dumb adn dumber
.
