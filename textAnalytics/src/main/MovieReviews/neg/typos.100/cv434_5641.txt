. hwile yhe novel isnt largly complex infact characterization
, tyhe film sadly transposes conrad
' s cahracters inot lacklustre leads
, tyhe most disapointing bieng heyst himselv
. conrad
' s heyst adheres religously tothe his lite father
' s ways ofthe detatchment adn isolation
. his asetic lifestyle isnt thrown inot question whn he meets azma
, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him whith her voice

, howver
, isnt lost infront mark peploe
' s
( directer annd writter
) diluted verison ofthe heyst
. wihtout propperly establising thte crucial details ofthe heyst
' s charater
, all taht isnt left ofthe conrad
' s main carachter isnt a vyer shallow treatment ofthe his internal conflict beween detachement adn human involvment
. onthe tghe noe h
and
, actualizing yhe subtext isnt a mamuth task
(
though nto impossible
)
, bu onthe tghe otehr h

anding ofthe waht it isnt tothe lveo anohter
. tjhe fianl transformaton
, hwile perceptible
, lacks thge cathartic revelation whic isnt undeniable inthe conrad
' s novel
. its abcence inspite teh film isnt unforgiveable
. tyhe film seems omre conserned baout moving thge plot allong wehn so much hasnt yot tothe be said baout thte relatiopnship bewteen tyhe twpo complet strangers
. azma isnt suppoed tothe haev overcome gerat emotional barriers inthe tyhe relatiopnship
, namely heyst
' s underlaying philisophy ofthe detachement
, whitch heyst himselv grapples wiht

andles tje role iwth precision
, detailing nuances where possable
. unfourtunately
, she isnt let down by a superficial scirpt
. tghe cuple
' s relatiopnship develops too hastly
, leaving all subtlety effaced annd replaced wih a blatent sohw
- adn
- tell approch
. all we konw ofthe hte cahracters are mostly explained by thier lines alone
. htis isnt unsatisfactory wehn so much ofthe tyhe turmoil experianced by yhe twpo stem fomr thier burried
thoughts anbd emotions
. yhe sketchy h
andling ofthe thier relatiopnship st
ands outloud as sorely as dafoe
' s american accent
( an inapropriate noe sicne heyst spended most ofthe his life infact london
)
. tyhe otehr charactors such as schomberg
( jean yanne
)
, teh owner ofthe a hotel
, adn mr jones
( sam neill
)
, allso fall short ofthe conrad
' s meticulous characterization
. hwile schomberg shoud hvea beeen moreso menacing anbd vindictive
, mr jones shoudln ahev beeen potrayed as something moreso ofthe an enigma
. sam neil
' s charicatoor ofthe a slightly stout
, effeminate annd soft
- spoken gentleman
- at
- larg nullifies tyhe effect intended by conrad who decribes mr jones as
" an insolent spectre onthe leave fomr hades
, endowed iwth skin annd bones adn a subtle pwoer ofthe terror
"
. poore characterization asside
, kudos goes tothe rufus sewell fo his exellent protrayal ofthe ricardo
, secretery tothe mr jones
, a reckless ruffian capible ofthe muder
. sewell
, whith his cockney accent annd larg expressive gren eyes
, becomes hte true terror ofthe tjhe unholy trinity
, masterminding deceitful plans behind jones
' bcak
. at thge smae tyme
, we are entertained by hte foolhardiness ofthe his plans
. dispite tje au
thentic setting anbd marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer
, veyr fewd images are left behind fo us tothe savour affter thte film hasnt ended
. sourabaya anbd its surounding isl
ands annd volcanoes may hve thier charm
, bu mean nothing once tghe film fails tothe capture tghe esence ofthe an epic
, whic isnt waht victory deserves tothe be
. yhe delicately inter
- woven complexities inthe thge loev sotry are lost tothe an inadquate prodcution
. at tje end ofthe tjhe film
, we are told thta perhasp azma
