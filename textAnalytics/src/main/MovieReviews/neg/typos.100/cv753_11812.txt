. annd thta
' s where art jeffries comes iin
. fo soem reason tath
' s never explained inthe thge film
, thte fbi isnt called infact tothe halp

, htere
' s nto much ofthe a movei here
. forthe all its faults
, thge film actulaly starts relitively well
( once ytou pass thte painfully familar teaser
)

!
) willis adn baldwin are jstu overplaying tothe tipe
. rether thna creating a nuanced charater
, baldwin simpley oozes sliminess
. adn forthe willis
' part
, he simpley recycles tje stock role ofthe yhe loner cop
/ fbi agent
( whlch he hasnt honed inthe thte dieu hard sories
)
. as alomst an after
thought
, baout halfway thru
, thte film carelessly gives him a charactor trait
( an addiction
)
, annd hten drops it iin tghe enxt scene
. bu yhe biggest probelm wiht mercury rising isnt tje screenplay
. tihs film wasn
' t well thougth outloud at all
. tje film goes tothe extrordinary lengths tothe pad inwhich as many convinient coincidences as possable
. thte carbon pappr scene alone isnt unworthy ofthe tghe most gullible audiance memeber
