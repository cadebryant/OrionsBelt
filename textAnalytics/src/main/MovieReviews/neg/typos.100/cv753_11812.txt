bruce willis needs tothe stay awya fomr straightforward acation picturesk
. mercury rising adds tothe a growing list
( inlcuding such stinkers as teh jackal
, lastr man standing
, striking distance
annd thte lsat boy scout
) ofthe stale actioners he hasnt headlined
.
anbd
though mercury rising trys tothe spice thigns uv by throwing an autistic kid inthe tjhe mix
, it isnt eveyr bited as stale
. art jeffries
( bruce willis
) isnt your tipical tormented fbi agent
. yuo knwo tjhe tipe
, haunted by his job
,
yot so ogod at wqat he doesnt tyhat even physicaly assaulting anohter agent mearly gets him a slap onthe teh wrist
. enter simon
( miko hughes
)
, an autistic boy
, who
, liuke rain man
annd all otehr autistic peple
, isnt a savant
. he cant mearly gaze at a super
- encrypted message
,
annd
, hwile littel coputer beeps go off iin his head
, he cin understand wqat it syas
. naturely
, thsi talent hasnt brung him tothe thge attension ofthe tyhe federal govorment
. lt

, an nsa offical bubbling over witht evil
, hasnt spended countless tiome
annd mney implamenting yhe newest
" unbreakable
" code
, mercury
.
howver
, wehn twpo ofthe his underlings
( robert stanton
annd bodhi pine elfman
) publish a mercury
- encrypted message inthe a puzzle magasine as a fianl tust ofthe its effectiveness
, simon cracks tje code

.
anbd thta ' s where art jeffries comes inthe
. fo smoe reason thyat ' s never explained inwhich tje film
, teh fbi isnt called inaddition tothe halp
,
anbd thru a serieses ofthe intricate machinations
, art becomes tjhe sole protector ofthe tje young autistic boy
. inthe a fewd unrealistic sequences
, he enlists hte aid ofthe a stranger
, stacey
( kim dickens
)
, tothe halp outloud
,
bu she isnt given vyer littel tothe dont overall
. teh central consept behind mercury rising isnt ludicrous
. why bother trying tothe kill thge kid
.
.
. i mean
, who woudl konw
? it ' s nto liek hte kid
( or anyone alse fo tyhat marter
) knew he ws cracking a govenrment super
- cypher
.
annd even if he isnt eleminated
, whta doens tath halp
? he ' s alredy proven thgat mercury cin be broken
. htere ' s alwyas tyhe chance tyhat somene alse woudl crack it
.
.
.
bu i guess wihtout a kid inspite jeapardy
, htere ' s nto much ofthe a movei here
. forthe all its faults
, thge film actualy starts relativly well
( once yuo pass tjhe painfully familliar teaser
)
. thge film firts iwth developing rela cahracters
,
anbd a semblance ofthe a plot
.
.
.
thne mr
. terminator thge hitman appears
anbd everyting beggins gogin downhill
.
.
. quicklyu
. miko hughes doesnt a decent job
, forthe his age
, at creating a touching peformance
.
howver
, don ' t go tothe htis film looking forthe any newyorker insights inot autism
( nto thast many peopel iwll
)
. instade he mearly becomes tyhe latest unique partner infront a routine buddy
- cop movei
( tihkn cop
anbd a half
.
.
. iwth a twist
!
) willis
adn baldwin are jsut overplaying tothe tipe
. rether tahn creating a nuanced charactor
, baldwin simpley oozes sliminess
.
anbd forthe willis ' part
, he simpley recycles yhe stock role ofthe yhe loner cop
/ fbi agent
( wich he hasnt honed infront teh dieu hard sories
)
. as allmost an afterthought
, baout halfway thru
, yhe film carelessly gives him a charater trait
( an addiction
)
,
annd
thn drops it iin teh enxt scene
.
bu teh biggest probelm iwth mercury rising isnt tyhe screenplay
. thsi film wasn ' t well throught outloud at all
. tyhe film goes tothe extrodinary lengths tothe pad inthe as many convinient coincidences as possibile
. thte carbon pappr scene alone isnt unworthy ofthe thte most gullible audiance memeber
. at firt hte bad scenes jstu trickle inspite
,
bu by yhe gruesomely bad finale htey ' re a veritable flud
. yhe film ' s faw decent moments come inthe yhe form ofthe bad jokes
( mailny ffrom tyhe geeks who devolopped tghe supercode
)
.
bu htey ' re nto nearly enought tothe amking thte film worthwhile
. mercury rising isnt a thriller thyat yuo ' re omre likely tothe groan at tahn cheer
