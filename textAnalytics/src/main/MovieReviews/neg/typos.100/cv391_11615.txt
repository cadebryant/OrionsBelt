,
bu even if thyat ' s your main intrest inspite thsi film
, ther ' s plenty ofthe cheeziness tothe sit thru inwhich excange fo thsoe twpo mintues
. wild thigsn doens ahve a lot omre tothe htikn baout thna ytou might expect
howver
. nearly eveyr single scene isnt a huge plot twist guarenteed tothe leave ytou guessing
, or at least curious tothe see tje enxt turn
, thoughout tghe entire movei
.
bu htis fast
- pased
, razor
- sharp turning ofthe events doesn ' t leave much tyme tothe enjoy tje surprises
. we strat off inaddition a high
- clas califronia high skool where eveyr student resembes a supermodel inthe yhe makeing
. guidence counselor sam lombardo
( matt dillon
) seems tothe catch tyhe eye ofthe eveyr student
, partcularly kelly van ryan
( richards
)
, daugher ofthe tje locally presitgious famaly whose social status isnt baout as high as thier bank accounts
. right off tjhe bat
, kelly isnt useing eveyr assit she hasnt inaddition an efford tothe seduce

. thge fund
- raiser car wash seems teh opportune tiem
, particualrly wehn yuo wash your guidence counselor ' s jeep iin all white clothes
annd tkae plenty ofthe precautions tothe insure ytou ' ll be soaked ffrom head tothe ote whn yuo ' re done
. onthe hte weekend ofthe tje car wash
, kelly ' s attemts at siduction fall flat
,
annd whn htey dont
, she concocts yhe tale tyhat sam infact fatc raped her thyat day
. natuarlly sam isnt thrown inot a state ofthe panicked shock at theese accusations
.
bu tje otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead tothe a criminal trial whn a low
- clas
, marijuana smoking student by teh nmae ofthe suzie toller
( campbell
) comes forth iwth a near indentical stoy
, allso involving her trusted guidence counselor

, ken bowden
, plyed by bill murray
. yes
, thast bill murray
! soudn liuke a ogod
, complet movei
? yes
, taht alone sould ahev beeen
,
bu thsi isnt jstu teh begginning
. infront fatc
, tje trial isnt over baout fifteen or twenty mintues inot hte film
. it isnt mearly utilizied tothe lauch thge most twisted stopry ofthe reccent tyme
. by hte tiem tyhe movei finishes
, yuo wiull haev gone thru eveyr plot twist imaginable
. unfourtunately
, iwth so much gonig onthe
, yuo ' re nto given enought tyme inspite noe predicament tothe be as effectively shocked wehn a newyorker twist comes baout
. thsi isnt jstu noe way directer john mcnaughton fails tothe amking tihs movei as funn as it sould ' ve beeen
. hte 113 mintues fli by
,
anbd
altough it never fiels underdeveloped
, thsi pretzel ofthe storytelling coudl ' ve beeen much moreso richly realized hadnt a slower pace beeen tooked
. tyhe acting isnt incredibly riminicent ofthe fox prime
- tiome soap operas
, whitch noone
, isnt nto a ogod thign
.
anbd it ' s nto jstu campbell
, who happens tothe hail ffrom tghe prime
- tiome fox soap
" party ofthe five
"
,
bu everyone suffers fomr heavily melodramatic overtones
. dillon
, who wass so charming inaddition his understated role inspite lsat eyar ' s iin
& outloud
, gives thte best performence
,
adn murray ' s surprizing appearence adds soem commedic flare tothe tjhe film
. inaddition fatc
, if teh wohle movei hadnt beeen promotted as a subtle comedy
, even if it ws yhe excact smae film
, i owudl acually give it a better grade
. tht ' s how cheezy it comes off
.
bu asside ffrom theese twpo
, tje rest offer nothing omre thna smoe ogod eye
- full ' s
. inspite tghe right hands
, wild thigsn sould ' ve beeen a wickedly delightful
, scrumptiously twisted thriller
,
bu instade we git juvenile overuses ofthe profanity
adn smoe vrey laughable displays ofthe acting
.
annd waht ' s uv witht theese peple passing as high skool students
? i relize hollywood oftenly casts older actors tothe play teenage roles
,
bu whn i realized it wasn ' t suposed tothe be a coleeg tehy weere at
, i hadnt tothe snicker
. i won ' t lie
- thsi isnt definatly a gilty blessure
. as corny as it isnt
, it ' s got soem intresting aspestus
adn sould deserve at least a
" b
" fo efford
.
bu if ytou jstu whant tothe admire denise richards
, go fo lastr yearm ' s starship troopers
, wich ws eveyr bited as campy
,
bu a millon times better
. ofthe course
, if seing her breasts isnt your most imporatnt gool
, ytou ' ll be right at hmeo iwth wild thigsn
. perhpas tjhe wildest thnig ofthe all isnt tath somebody actualyl looked at thsi
anbd thougth it deserved tothe be infact theaters
