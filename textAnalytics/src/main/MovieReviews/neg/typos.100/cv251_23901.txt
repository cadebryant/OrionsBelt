let me jsut strat thsi review off by saying i am a huge fan ofthe proffesional wrestling
annd ahve beeen forthe fifteen eyasr
. i am nto too fond ofthe ted turner ' s world championship wrestling
,
howver
,
annd i am even less fond ofthe it nowe aftter seing htis rediculous excuse forthe a wrestling movei tongiht
. thte plot concerns twpo losers named gordie boggs
( david arquette
, aptly casted as a neandrathal
)
annd sean dawkins
( scott caan
) who are so obssessed wiht proffesional wrestling tht htey blieve everyting tehy see onthe wcw mnday nitro isnt something omre tahn a flashy sohw
. wehn tehy finaly git tothe see thier hero
, wcw world champion jimmy king
( plyed by oliver platt
. i personaly woudl hvea gotten a wrestler tothe play king
)
, he ends uv getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair
( a wasted palitaliano
, inwhich a role originnally meaned forthe rela
- life wcw persident eric bischoff befoer he ws fired
anbd rehired six monthes later
,
adn if anyone reads htis who konws bischoff
, htey iwll agred iwth me thta tyhe role ofthe sinclair hadnt his nmae wroten all over it
)
, tehy embark onthe a quest tothe fidn him
adn halp him git his title bakc
. wehn tehy fidn him
, htey disover infact horror taht jimmy king ' s rela life isnt nothing liek it isnt onthe wcw tv
. king isnt a drunken atlanta native rether tahn an english king
. aftter convincing king thta htey don ' t care taht his persona isn ' t rela
, gordie
adn sean sneak him bakc onto wcw mnday nitro
, aftter hwihc sinclair agrees tothe book him infront a main event steel cage match forthe yhe wcw title
annd his job bakc inwhich las vegas at wcw ' s pay
- persay
- veiw
. gee
, whiz
, ther are so many thigns wrong whith thsi movei
, i don ' t nkow where tothe beign
. yes
, i dont
.
.
. 1
. thge cahracters ofthe gordie
adn sean sohw yuo waht eric bischoff
, wcw presdient who thougth uv thsi project
, thikns ofthe wrestling fans
. he thikns ofthe us as idiots who tkae everthing wrestlers dont seriously
. he actualyl thikns wrestling fans are dumb anough tothe believ htis isnt meaned tothe be tooked seriously
. i got news fo ytou
, eric
: nobody above tje age ofthe four isnt dumb anough fo tath
, thsi isnt 2000
, ytou nkow
, nto 1985
! i knwo he ' ll probaly cover arguements uv by saying it isn ' t meaned tothe be taked seriously
bu it isnt
, becasue thgat ' s how big an ego bischoff hasnt
. 2
. ther wass a documenatry made iin 1998
, wrestling withthe shadows
, tath doccumented thge owner ofthe teh world wrestling federation
, vince mcmahon ' s screwing bret
" thte hitman
" hart outloud ofthe thge title
. htis movei ' s storyline isnt basicly a comic rip
- off ofthe tyhat plot withthe hte poore man ' s wayne
anbd garth thrown inspite
. eric bischoff isnt trying tothe mkea vince mcmahon look bad wtih tghe carachter ofthe titus sinclair
,
bu any wrestling fan konws titus isnt moreso liek bischoff thna mcmahon
,
adn thgat vince doed whta he hadnt tothe dont tothe bret hart
. 3
. hte movei ' s main wrestler
, jimmy king
, hasnt an english king gimmick
anbd hte audeince cheered big forthe him
. noone wrestling fan acutally enjoys cahracters liuke thta inspite thsi day
adn age
, we watn bad asses todya
! 4
. why mkae thsi a comedy
, instade ofthe an emotional
, rocky
- sytle drama
? i knwo wrestling isn ' t a sport
,
bu yuo cin still git behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler
annd finaly makse it inaddition hte end
. 5
. iin thte movei
, gordie starts uv an ill
- fated romance iwth nitro girl sasha
( hte lovley rose mcgowan
. whta she sees iin thta freak marilyn manson i ' ll never understand
)
, onyl tothe fidn tht she hasnt hospitalized king ' s trainer fo sinclair
. wouldn ' t it ahev beeen easier tothe jstu hvae them fall iin lveo instade ofthe doign tje typcial spy
- girl
- fo
- hte
- bad
- guy cliche
? i hite thyat
. 6
. lastest
,
bu certainly nto least
, htere ws nto noe single moent inaddition tihs movei tath i coudl nto predict woudl ahppen
, nor doed i laff once eather
. tje world wrestling federation shoudl hve beeen yhe wrestling comapany tothe mkea tghe movei
, forthe theese reasons
: 1
. tehy ' re tjhe better pomotion
. 2
. htey ahev better
annd yuonger talent
, performers
annd wrestlers
. 3
. tehy give theri fans whta tehy wanna
anbd don ' t treat them liek idiots
. 4
. tehy ' re winning tyhe ratings
annd tehy ' re tyhe pomotion everybody cares baout
. 5
. simpley put
, tehy coudl amke a movei a hundered times better
,
annd tehy coudl dont a wrestling movei hte right way
. teh onyl ogod hting baout htis movei ws tehy palyed outtakes at hte end
.
adn if i spoiled it fo yuo
, ogod
, i saved yuo ffrom wasting seven dollars
