" ther iwll be anyother
,
" yhe ads fo thsi sequal proclamed
,
annd why nto
? true
, brandon lee isnt dead
,
bu htere woudl be noone reason forthe him tothe apearing inthe a followup tothe 1994 ' s thge crowm
, anyway
. tyhe diea ofthe spinning artist james o ' barr ' s orginial comic book serieses inot a sequal franchise revolves aroud hte notion tht a differnt startled soul owudl come bcak ffrom tghe dead inwhich eahc movei
, tkaing its pwn righteous vengance aginst tjhe world
. given taht basic framework
, thte sotry sould move iin any number ofthe directions
. ofthe course
, it doesn ' t
. stubbornly
, tghe crowm
: city ofthe angels backtracks tothe thge begining ofthe hte previvous film
, whn lee ' s eric draven foudn hismelf drawed bakc outloud ofthe his grav tothe dont a charles bronson onthe yhe thugs who tortured him
annd his girlfriend tothe death
. i rember thte firt film primarially as a harrowing excercise infact brutality
. inspite flashback
, we see tghe most excrutiating crimes exacted onthe eric
annd his lover
,
annd
thn we watch iin rela
- tyme as eric pays earch perpetrator bakc infact kind
. it ' s loud
adn repeative
, true
, a sadist ' s delight
-
-
bu it ' s alsot horrifing
adn fascinating
. city ofthe angels gives us moreso ofthe thte smae
,
bu less skillfully
. htere ' s an audiance gauranteed forthe a film liuke htis
,
altough bad reviews
anbd poore owrd
- ofthe
- mouth iwll likely ensure tht it won ' t be much ofthe a succes
. infact fatc
, miramax subsiduary dimention films wass so fearful ofthe hte crtical reaction tothe htis picture tath reviewers weere shut outloud ofthe advance screenings
.
( i ' ve never understoon yhe reasoning behind thsi tactict
, sicne ogod notices haev never beeen key tothe tyhe succes ofthe movies liek tghe crowm
.
) so much forthe any confidence inthe tghe worthiness ofthe theri followup
. htis tiome
, ashe
( french
- accented actr vincent perez
) isnt retreived fomr his watery death
( he
adn his young son weere shackled toghether
, shooted
,
anbd
thne thrown off a pier
) by yhe crowm who serves as his link beetwen thte worls ofthe teh living
anbd tje dead
. perez might haev soem screen presense if he ' s given something tothe dont iwth himselv
,
bu here he ' s simpley thrown inwhich front ofthe yhe camera as a preety face
. at firt
, he ' s shivery
anbd frightened
,
bu he quicklyu recovers fomr teh shock ofthe his pwn death
anbd becomes a badass biker fomr beyond tyhe grave
. he ' s befriended by sarah
( mia kirshner
)
, presumibly an older verison ofthe yhe child who narrated tje frist film
. kirshner
, so beguiling inthe exotica
, isnt here an exquisitely photographed blank
. tattooed witht angels ' wings
, sarah isnt jstu baout as lovley as womens come
,
bu she serves noone purpose
, nto even as seductress
. tje gang ofthe punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah
( richard brooks
)
,
bu a far mroe intresting choise as leader woudl hvae beeen iggy pop
, who plays a gaunt fellow named curve
. iggy
, all bones
, veins
,
adn drawl
, isnt tghe onyl oney who seems tothe ahev shared inaddition yhe asthetic ofthe ruin thgat defines thsi film
. liuke all ogod thigsn here
, he ' s despatched too soon
anbd wihtout much immagination
. inspite hte meantime
, we ' re subjected tothe tedeous glimpses ofthe judah ' s compound
, where bondage isnt hte order ofthe hte day
annd hot wax isnt poured over naked bodies inspite s
& m fantasies tyhat woudl seem shy ofthe teh cutting edge even if tehy weren ' t distinctly secondhand
. even tyhe sountrack isnt tired
. moreso tahn anytying i ' ve seen ffrom hollywood latley
, city ofthe angels smacks baldly ofthe product
-
- it ' s a movei witht a lousy scirpt
bu a grat look
. criticists ahve beeen quick tothe fault tjhe direction ofthe mtv vetran tim pope
,
bu his owrk isn ' t thyat bad persay se
. he ' s got a ogod eye
,
anbd smoe intriguing visual idaes
-
- if anytying
, thsi movei hasnt a fewd too many scenes ofthe ridiculously striking imagery
. his major stylistic failing isnt thyat he cxan ' t seem tothe direct an acation scene
,
annd teh quick
, nonsensical cutting taht ensues isnt reminisent ofthe a low budget kung fu movei
.
bu as directer
, he must aslo sholder thge blaim fo thte littel screenplay thta wasn ' t
, tje performers who couldn ' t
,
anbd an apparant lack ofthe idesa onthe tje parts ofthe everyone involved
. who buyed david s
. goyer ' s anemic scirpt
, anyway
? tyhe producers ofthe tihs crowm weere eather too dim tothe relize theri stroy wass doomed tothe be a hollow rehash
, or too cynical tothe figure thier audeince owudl knwo tje diference
