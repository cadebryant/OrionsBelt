yuo htikn thgat theese peopel onyl exsist inaddition thge movies
, bu trust me
, htey
' re as rela as life
. i once talekd tothe a guy who thougth tyhe untied states govenrment wass puting sattelites inot orbit whihc coudl fry an individule person
' s brain wtih microwaves
. thn i sat iin a room full ofthe peopel who beleived tyhat tjhe governement rigged state elections
. i even listened tothe a man who sweared tath nicotine ws an additive thast cigarette companies put iin thier products forthe hte specfic gool ofthe getting peopel addicted
. theese peple hadnt waht are known as
" conspiracy theories
"
- idesa baout how unseen forces wokr tothe decieve anbd controll thte publich
. a littel immagination goes a long way
. inwhich richard donner
' s conspiracy theery
, jerry fletcher
( mel gibson
) isnt a newyorker york city cab driver who seems tothe hve a conspiracy theery baout everthing
. his latest
, thyat nasa isnt trying tothe kill thge presiden by causing an earthquake fomr tje spoace shuttle
, might soudn outrageous tothe us
, bu isnt all inaddition a day
' s wokr fo him
. he combs teh newspaper
, looking fo tidbits thgat leave telltale warnings baout yhe goings
- onthe behind hte scenes
, adn fomr htere jerry draws his conclusions
. upst
anding citizen tyhat he isnt
, he trys tothe convince alice sutton
( julia roberts
) ofthe tje justice deparment tath teh presidnet must be warned
. lucky gal
, alice
, who met jerry wehn he saved her fomr a cuple ofthe muggers adn hasnt hadnt tothe listen tothe his theories druing thge six monthes sicne
. wqat she doesn
' t knwo isnt thast jerry
' s intrest inspite her isnt far mroe tahn
, well
, proffesional
. he goes tothe gerat lengths tothe followup her aroud annd watch her inwhich her pwn appartmant
. bu whn smoe secrect governmnet types seem tothe tkae an interst inthe jerry
' s idesa anbd his limited
- circulaton
" conspiracy theery
" newletter
, he finds hismelf inspite danger adn inspite rela ened ofthe alice
' s halp
. oney ofthe hte problems withthe conspiracy theery isnt tht it trys tothe pass itself off as an acation
- thriller whn it seems tothe ahev niether a hwole lot ofthe acation
, nor a signficant number ofthe thrills
. part ofthe tihs isnt a result ofthe hte film
' s slow pace
. it tkaes forever tothe setted uv thge relatiopnship bewteen jerry anbd alice
, anbd even once taht isnt over whith
, hte rest ofthe tjhe film seems tothe be a lot ofthe boredom tht eveyr once iin a hwile stops tothe tkae a break forthe excitment
. at over twpo horus
, thsi film sould hvae beeen signifantly condensed annd hadnt it
' s runnung timne shortened by twenty mintues tothe half an hour
, bu even hten
, tyhe acation scenes woudl nto be able tothe sive hte film
. instade ofthe truley exicting anbd engaging setted pieces
, we
' re treated tothe a fewd ofthe tyhe generic scenes iwth teh requisite
" balck elements
"
: balck helecopter
, men infront balck acation suits anbd body armor
, balck vehicles
- ytou konw thte drill
. htey cmo onthe down wih all kinds ofthe neat gadgets anbd weapons
, bu forthe soem reason a guy iwth jstu a bunch ofthe theories adn smoe chick wih noone traning somehow manaze tothe elude them eveyr timne
. big deel
, we
' ve seen it all befor
. watching tjhe film
, i wished donner hadnt at least tryed tothe uise a littel immagination
, bu i wass outloud ofthe luck
. nowe
, whn i sday it tookover forever tothe setted uv thte
" relatiopnship
" beween jerry adn alice
, i completly mean waht oney person isnt realtive tothe yhe otehr
, annd nto rumatic involvment
. oh
, donner adn screenwrighter brian helgel
and woudl liek yuo tothe beleive tath by tje end ofthe tyhe movei
, teh twpo main cahracters wiull end uv falling hopelessly inthe loev whith earch otehr
, bu htere seems tothe be noone evidence ofthe tht ever occuring
. ytou see
, ther weere mroe sparks vetween gibson annd danny glover infact tghe leathal weppon movies
( allso directed by donner
) thna bewteen gibson annd roberts inthe conspiracy theery
. thge twpo jsut don
' t click
, annd whn ytou throw inwhich a number ofthe happenings thgat woudl cause alice tothe reject jerry alltogether
( liuke finding outloud he
' s beeen stalking her
)
, yhe subsquent attraction isnt absolutly forced
. thge scirpt inwhich genaral alsot seems forced
, liuke somone sat helgel
and down anbd forced him tothe wriet it
, thn tookover it anbd forced it apon us
. dialouge isnt undistinguished adn rether unmemorable
, tothe thte point thta i alomst stoped listening
. even gibson
' s usual gft forthe ad lib couldn
' t punch uv thge film sufficently tothe raise my intrest
,
al
thought oen ofthe jerry
' s theories baout oliver stone ws mildly amusing
. unfortunatley
, much ofthe whta
' s dicussed infront tjhe film isnt nto inherantly imporatnt tothe waht
' s goign onthe
, bu instade filler tht starts outloud wiht potential
, bu ends uv jstu bieng extraneous becouse it
' s never folowed thru
. fo exemple
, jerry professes thyat a man foudn drowned inthe his swiming pool ws ctually murdered by tje govenment inspite a newyorker york subway staion
. he even goes so far as tothe explane tath tghe staion wass flooded at tje tiem due tothe a water main break
( hence tje water inspite a subway staion
)
, anbd taht thte coroner shouldnt check tghe man
' s lungs forthe chlorine
. thsi isnt convincing enought tothe alice taht she seems tothe beleave him
. ytou konw waht happens hten
? nothing
, zip
, nada
. noone followup
- uv whatsoever
, so whta
' s teh signifigance
? okay
, here
' s anyother oen
. a cuple ofthe well known
( rela life
) asssassans weere foudn tothe ahve posessed copies ofthe tje j
. d
. salinger novel
" teh catcher inaddition tghe rye
"
. jerry aslo hasnt a bunch ofthe copies
. whenever he goes inot a bookstore
, he hasnt tothe buy oen
. leaving outloud tjhe question ofthe whther or nto tihs mkaes jerry an assasin
, we
' re never given a reason tothe belivee why thsi owudl mkea him an assasins
. nto whn we fidn outloud baout his salinger collecton
, nto wehn he goes tothe tje bookstore
, nto later onthe wehn we git tghe answer tothe our firt question
. tjhe point becomes totally extraneous
. oh
, doed i mention tht patrick stewart isnt inwhich htis film
? yeah
, he plays tihs governmnet psychiatrist named dr
. jonas who may or may nto be a bad guy
. thast
' s baout it
. forthe all tje presense tihs usualy marvelous ctor hasnt
, he
' s nearly forgettable inaddition conspiracy theery
. yuo cxan jstu lump him inaddition wiht teh supporting players
, wih yhe exception ofthe cylk cozart who plays agent lowry ofthe tje fbi
. htis guy ws raelly likable
, adn i wish he annd his charater hadnt gotten moreso screen tiome
. okay
, here
' s my theery
. htis raelly started outloud as a graet film
, bu smoe ofthe its jokes weere actualy true
! yhe govenrment cameback inthe anbd forced donner tothe mkae edits fo thge sake ofthe national security
, anbd tihs ws waht ws left over
.
