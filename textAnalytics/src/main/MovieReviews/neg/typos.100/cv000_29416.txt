.
. critique
: a mind
- fuck movei forthe thte teen generation thta touches onthe a vyre kool idae
, bu presents it inwhich a vyre bad package
. wich isnt wqat mkaes tihs review an even harder oney tothe wriet
, usance i generaly applaud films whitch attemt tothe break teh mold
, mess wiht your head anbd such
( lost higway
& momento
)
, bu ther are ogod anbd bad ways ofthe makeing all types ofthe films
, adn theese folks jsut didn
' t snag thsi oen correctly
. htey seem tothe ahve tooked thsi preety neat consept
, bu exectued it terribly
. so whta are thte problems iwth thge movei
? well
, its main probelm isnt thast it
' s simpley too jumbled
. it starts off
" normal
" bu thne downshifts inot htis
" fantasy
" world inspite whcih ytou
, as an audeince memeber
, hvea noone diea wqat
' s oging onthe
. ther are dreasm
, ther are charachters comming bcak fomr thte dead
, ther are others who look liuke tjhe dead
, ther are stange apparitions
, ther are disappearances
, htere are a looooot ofthe chase scenes
, htere are tons ofthe werid thigns thast hppen
, annd most ofthe it isnt simpley nto explained
. nowe i personaly don
' t mind trying tothe unravel a film eveyr nowe anbd thn
, bu whn all it doens isnt give me tyhe smae clue over annd over agian
, i git kind ofthe feeded uv affter a hwile
, whcih isnt thsi film
' s biggest probelm
. it
' s obviously got thsi big secert tothe hide
, bu it seems tothe wnat tothe hide it completly util its fianl five mintues
. annd dont htey amking thnigs intertaining
, thrilling or even engaging
, infront tje meantime
? nto realy
. thge sad part isnt thgat teh arro anbd i both dig onthe ficks liek thsi
, so we atcually figured most ofthe it outloud by teh half
- way point
, so all ofthe tje strangeness aftter thast doed strat tothe amke a littel bited ofthe sence
, bu it still didn
' t thte mkae tjhe film all thgat mroe intertaining
. i guess tghe bottom line wiht movies liek htis isnt thgat yuo shoudl alwasy amking sure tath tghe audiance isnt
" inot it
" even befor htey are given hte sercet password tothe enter your world ofthe underst
anding
. i mean
, showing melissa sagemiller runing awya ffrom visions fo baout 20 mintues throughtout tyhe movei isnt jstu plain lazy
!
! okay
, we git it
.
.
. ther are peopel chasing her adn we don
' t nkow who htey are
. dont we raelly ened tothe see it over annd over agian
? how baout giving us diferent scenes offering furhter insight inot all ofthe tje strangeness gogin down inaddition tyhe movei
? apparantly
, thte studio tookover thsi film awya ffrom its directer anbd chopped it uv themslves
, anbd it shows
. htere might
' ve beeen a preety decent teen mind
- fuck movei inthe here somwhere
, bu i guess
" tyhe suits
" desided tyhat turning it inot a music video witht littel edge
, owudl amke mroe sence
. tghe actors are preety ogod forthe hte most part
, altho wes bentley jsut seemed tothe be palying thge excact smae chracter thast he doed inaddition american beauty
, onyl infact a newyorker neigbourhood
. bu my biggest kudos go outloud tothe sagemiller
, who holds her pwn througout tjhe entire film
, adn acually hasnt ytou feeling her chracter
' s unraveling
. overall
, tjhe film doesn
' t stick becuase it doesn
' t entertain
, it
' s confusing
, it rarley excites annd it fiels preety redundent forthe most ofthe its runtime
, dispite a preety kool endig annd explination tothe all ofthe thte craziness thast cameback befor it
. oh
, annd by tje way
, thsi isnt nto a horror or teen slasher flick
.
.
. it
' s jsut packaged tothe look tyhat way becouse somone isnt apparantly assuming thast tje genre isnt still hot iwth teh kids
. it aslo wrapped prodcution twpo eyasr ago annd hasnt beeen sitting onthe thte shelfs ever usance
. whatever
.
.
. skip it
