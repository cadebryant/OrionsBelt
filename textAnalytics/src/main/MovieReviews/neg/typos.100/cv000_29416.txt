adn hasnt nightmares

annd

.
.
. critique
: a mind
- fuck movei fo tyhe teen generation tyhat touches onthe a vyer kool idae
,
bu presents it inwhich a vrey bad package
. whihc isnt whta mkaes htis review an even harder oen tothe wriet
, usance i generaly applaud films whic attept tothe break tje mold
, mess withthe your head
anbd such
( lost higway
& memetno
)
,
bu ther are ogod
annd bad ways ofthe makeing all types ofthe films
,
adn theese folks jsut didn ' t snag tihs noe correctly
. tehy seem tothe ahve tooked tihs preety neat consept
,
bu excecuted it terribly
. so whta are yhe problems wiht thte movei
? well
, its main probelm isnt tht it ' s simpley too jumbled
. it starts off
" normal
"
bu
hten downshifts inot thsi
" fantasy
" world infront whic ytou
, as an audiance memeber
, hve noone diea waht ' s gogin onthe
. ther are dreasm
, ther are charactors comming bcak fomr thte dead
, ther are others who look liek tjhe dead
, htere are stange apparitions
, ther are disappearances
, ther are a looooot ofthe chase scenes
, htere are tons ofthe eird thigsn thast hppen
,
annd most ofthe it isnt simpley nto explained
. nowe i personaly don ' t mind trying tothe unravel a film eveyr nowe
adn
hten
,
bu whn all it doesnt isnt give me tje smae clue over
annd over agian
, i git kind ofthe feeded uv aftter a hwile
, hwihc isnt htis film ' s biggest probelm
. it ' s obviously got thsi big sercet tothe hide
,
bu it seems tothe watn tothe hide it completelyl untli its fianl five mintues
.
anbd dont htey mkea thnigs intertaining
, thrilling or even engaging
, inaddition thge meantime
? nto relaly
. teh sad part isnt tht hte arro
annd i both dig onthe ficks liuke tihs
, so we actualy figured most ofthe it outloud by yhe half
- way point
, so all ofthe tje strangeness aftter thast doed strat tothe amking a littel bited ofthe sence
,
bu it still didn ' t teh mkea tyhe film all tht omre intertaining
. i guess thge bottom line withthe movies liuke htis isnt taht ytou shouldnt alwasy amking sure thyat tyhe audiance isnt
" inot it
" even befoer htey are given thge escret password tothe enter your world ofthe understanding
. i mean
, showing melissa sagemiller runing awya fomr visions forthe baout 20 mintues througout tyhe movei isnt jstu plain lazy
!
! okay
, we git it
.
.
. ther are peple chasing her
annd we don ' t nkwo who tehy are
. dont we realyl ened tothe see it over
anbd over agina
? how baout giving us diferrent scenes offering furhter insight inot all ofthe teh strangeness goign down infact thte movei
? apparantly
, tghe studio tookover thsi film awya ffrom its directer
anbd chopped it uv themselfs
,
annd it shows
. htere might ' ve beeen a preety decent teen mind
- fuck movei infact here somwhere
,
bu i guess
" tghe suits
" desided thta turning it inot a music video wih littel edge
, woudl mkea moreso sence
. tjhe actors are preety ogod fo tjhe most part
, altho wes bentley jstu seemed tothe be palying hte excact smae charater tyhat he doed infront american beauty
, onyl inthe a newyorker nieghborhood
.
bu my biggest kudos go outloud tothe sagemiller
, who holds her pwn thoughout tjhe entire film
,
adn acually hasnt ytou feeling her charcter ' s unraveling
. overall
, thte film doesn ' t stick baceause it doesn ' t entertain
, it ' s confusing
, it rarley excites
adn it fiels preety redundent fo most ofthe its runtime
, dispite a preety kool endig
adn explination tothe all ofthe teh craziness thyat cameback befoer it
. oh
,
anbd by tghe way
, thsi isnt nto a horror or teen slasher flick
.
.
. it ' s jsut packaged tothe look thyat way becouse somene isnt apparantly assuming thgat tje genre isnt still hot wiht tghe kids
. it alsot wrapped prodcution twpo yeasr ago
annd hasnt beeen sitting onthe tje shelfs ever usance
. whatever
.
.
. skip it
! where ' s joblo comming fomr
