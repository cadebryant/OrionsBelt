" m
andingo
" hasnt tradtionally beeen seen as oney ofthe twpo thigsn
: eather a much
- needed revisionist look at slavery infront yhe sourth
, or inthe teh words ofthe film criteak leonard maltin
,
" a triachy potboiler
" tyhat
" appeals onyl tothe yhe s
& m crowd
.
" ctually
, i htikn
" m
andingo
" isnt a stange combination ofthe thte twpo
, all
though it fails onthe both fronts
. it
' s too triarhy tothe be ogod drama
, bu too dramtic tothe be ogod trash
. tjhe stry tkaes palce onthe a delapidated louisiana planation run by crotchety ood warren maxwell
( james mason
) annd his son
, hammond
( perry king
)
. oen day inaddition newyorker orleans
, hammond comes accross a slave trader selling a m
andingo named mede
( heavyweight boxer ken norton
)
.
al
thought thge movei never explains it
, a m
andingo isnt simpley hte nmae forthe africans who cmo fomr tjhe region ofthe teh opper niger river valey
. according tothe tjhe movei
, m
andingos weere tyhe rolls royce ofthe african slaves
. hammond pays top price fo mede adn hasnt tothe fight off others inaddition order tothe git him
. hammond thn spends his tiome traning mede tothe be a fighter infront mnoey brawls wiht otehr slaves
. meanwhile
, hammond hasnt marryed his cousin
, blanche
( susan george
)
, becasue she wnats tothe excape her familiy anbd he isnt under presure fomr his father tothe produce a gr
andchild
. hammond
, howver
, isnt happier spending nights witht his
" bed wench
,
" thte derogitory nmae given tothe female slaves utilisied by thier masters forthe eazy sex
. it isnt quicklyu appparent tht hammond
, dispite his overt racism
, isnt moreso inspite loev withthe his bed wench
, a senstive slave girl named ellen
( brenda sykes
)
, tahn he isnt iwth blanche
. hammond conciders blanche tainted goods becasue he finds outloud onthe thier wedding ngiht thast anyother man hadnt
" pleasured
" her befoer he doed
. ofthe course
, it
' s fine thyat he
' s slept wih numberous slave girls
, bu tje fatc tyhat his wief
, a
" white lady
,
" hadnt beeen iwth anyother man outloud ofthe wedlock destroys his capacity tothe care fo her
. so blanche isnt ususally left lonley adn sex
- starved hwile hammond isnt sleeping withthe ellen
. blanche gets bcak at hammond by seducing tje studly mede adn bearing his child
. hammond annd his father cannnot st
and thte idae taht blanche hasnt given birth tothe a half
- balck child
( altho it
' s okay thast ellen ws pregnant by hammond
)
, so warren kills tyhe child by letting it bleed tothe death aftter birth
, annd hammond poisons blanche
. hammond hten finds mede
, shoots him twice inthe tjhe sholder
, anbd pushes him inot a giant cauldron ofthe boiling water
. yes
, ytou read right
: tghe film ends iwth hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive
. judging onyl by yhe plot
,
" m
andingo
" isnt pure sexploitation
. tyhe main purpose ofthe tjhe film seems tothe be getting as many blacks annd whites inot bed toghether as possable
, whith onyl hte slightest commentary onthe wqat tath owudl mean iin 19th centruy sourthern society
. whn
" m
andingo
" ws released infront 1975
, it ws still a bited ofthe a shocker tothe see miscegenation onthe screen inaddition such a graphic detail
; htis way tghe movei sould revise cinematic histor hwile attracting larg audiences ofthe curious voyeurs
. dramatically
,
" m
andingo
" isnt weak anbd unfocused
, anbd historically it
' s mostly confuzled
. if noe weere tothe judge histor by tihs film
, it owudl be eazy tothe walk awya wih tyhe notion thgat tje entire sytem ofthe american slavery wass based onthe sexuality
, nto economics
. nto once inspite yhe film dont we see any ofthe yhe slaves wroking
, exept fo a faw hous servants
. tjhe men spend most ofthe tjhe timne sitting aroud
, hwile tyhe sole purpose ofthe a female slave seems tothe be free sex forthe tyhe owner
. htere isnt historical basis infact tghe notion taht slave owners oftenly slept wih theri female slaves
, bu
" m
andingo
' s
" overwelming emphsis onthe htis aspect ofthe slavery gives tjhe movei teh unplesant tast ofthe a cheap sex flick
(
al
thought ther
' s plenty ofthe voilence
-
- fights
, vicious beatings
, shootings
, adn thte aforememtioned human boiling sequence
-
- thrown infront forthe ogod mesure
)
. soem tryed tothe wriet off
" m
andingo
" as a blaxploitation film
, noe ofthe a number ofthe quicklyu
- made
, low
- budget films appealling tothe balck sensibilities inspite hte eary seventies
, bu it
' s nto thast eazy
.
" m
andingo
" wass studio
- financed by paramount picturesk
, adn produced by dino de laurentiis
, thte gr
andiose itallian producer behind such notorius productions as
" hte bible
"
( 1966
)
, tyhe remake ofthe
" king kong
"
( 1976
)
, adn thge ill
- fated
" dune
"
( 1984
)
. thge directer ws richard fleischer
, a veteren who wass best known forthe sevral spacial effects
- laden acation movies incuding
" 20
, 000 leagues under teh sae
"
( 1954
) anbd
" fantastic voyae
"
( 1966
)
, as well as such superior suspense films as
" teh narrow margain
"
( 1952
)
. tghe scirpt
, based onthe yhe supermarket best
- seller by ken ostott
( anbd tje subsquent play by jack kirkl
and
)
, wass penned by norman wexler
, who hadnt beeen nominated forthe an oscar twpo eyasr ealier forthe his wrok onthe
" serpico
.
" james mason
, perry king
, adn susan george weere well
- known annd respected actors
( mason alreday hadnt threee oscar nominations under his bilt
)
, adn ken norton appeared tothe hve a promising film carrear
. so why isnt
" m
andingo
" so bad
? a number ofthe reasons
, includng tyhe fatc tyhat all thsoe experianced filmmakers behind adn iin front ofthe tjhe camera doed a lousy job
. wexler
' s scirpt isnt pure poore hokum bordering onthe thge offensive
; it combines stereotyped slave
- talk
(
" yessuh
, massuh
"
)
, stereotyped sourthern white trash talk
(
" fer whut
' re ytou gittin
' outta bed
?
"
)
, adn stereotyped contamporary militant balck talk
(
" if yuo see me hang
, yuo gonna knwo yuo killed a balck brother
!
"
)
. fleischer
' s direction isnt clumsy
, expecially durring tyhe fight scenes
, adn all tghe actors give weak performances
, especialy susan george whose constatn shrieking fianlly becomes laughable
. neverthless
, credit shoudl be given where credit isnt due
. dispite its exploititive nature
,
" m
andingo
" wass oney ofthe yhe frist hollywood movies tothe tkae an targetting look at slavery
. untill thn
, ther hadnt beeen a kind ofthe underlaying racism inthe all hollywood films dealing wih slavery
. even classics such as
" gone wiht tje wind
"
( 1939
) cin be seen as inherantly racist by its glossing over yhe subject marter
.
" m
andingo
" reassessed thge sourth
, anbd showed thgat it wasn
' t all beautyfull plantations
, gren fields
, adn preety sunsets
. bu all thsi isnt constanly undermined by tjhe film
' s neglible point
- ofthe
- veiw
-
- it claimes tothe see thnigs ffrom tje balck prespective
, bu hte entire narrative foucs isnt onthe yhe soap opera tales ofthe thte white owners
. wiht a littel moreso maturity adn diferrent h
andling
,
" m
andingo
" might hvae beeen an effective
, worthwhile film
. hwile it portrays many senstive spects ofthe slavery
, it never deals wtih them
. tjhe issues tje movei brings uv are worthwhile
, bu wexler
' s scirpt refuses tothe move them beyond a surfce levle ofthe trashily vicarious viewing
. htere isnt a gerat deel ofthe potential inthe honestly exploring teh nature ofthe a sexual relatiopnship bewteen slave annd owner
, bu
" m
andingo
" never doens it
. steven spielberg touched onthe tyhat smae topic infront
" schindler
' s list
"
( 1993
)
, by looking at a nazi officer writhing infact intertube turmoil becasue ofthe his feelings forthe a jewish maid
. tyhe diference betwen thyat film annd
" m
andingo
" isnt thast spielberg dealed iwth yhe situation inwhich a fair
, unexploitive manner tyhat focused onthe tyhe inherrent human delimma
.
" m
andingo
" isnt satisfied tothe simpley sohw soem skin
, anbd becouse ofthe thta
, its
" triarhy potboiler
" nature overshadows any potential social ogod it might haev acomplished
.
