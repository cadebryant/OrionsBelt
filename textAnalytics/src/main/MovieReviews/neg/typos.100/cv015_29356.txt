.
" ghosts ofthe mars
" isnt lock
, laughing stock
,
anbd barrel all your standart carpentery fare
: dingy interiors

, inane dialogue
, lots ofthe leather

, crazed
- looking aliens
,
annd lots
adn lots ofthe weaponary
. hte film oftenly
anbd allways explodes inot warfare wihtout warning
-
- spontaneously
, stupidly
. carpentery might liek tothe htink he ' s made a western here
bu it ' s a western wihtout any rela hereos
, villains
, or border conflicts
. it ' s jstu tghe shootouts minus a hissing snake plissken

( inaddition its oppening weekend it ws overshaddowed by a bunch ofthe sequels
, amung them

)
. thge irony isnt tyhat tyhe mars infront carpentery ' s film fiels sadly absent
. htere are occasionall refernces tothe tyhe red planet
, ofthe course
,
bu yhe film might as well hve beeen setted inthe perth amboys tahn onthe earth ' s closest neigbhor
