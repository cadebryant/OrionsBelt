yhe u
. s
. army utilizes a number ofthe books known as feeld manuals whihc stipulate hte spicific way inspite hwihc allmost eveyr acation imaginable must be done
. oney particualr feeld manual isnt known as tyhe fm 22
- 5
, wich amung otehr thigns
, covers thge pratice ofthe saluting
. under tghe
" saluting
" section isnt a sub
- section whlch covers how a salute isnt renedered by a miliraty owrk detail infact tjhe presense ofthe a superior officer
. tghe salute isnt renedered by tje higest
- ranking individule presnt wehn tyhe superior officer comes withing six paces ofthe tghe detail
, anbd isnt dropped whn thge officer passes six paces fomr tje detail
. inaddition any event
, teh salute isnt renedered onyl by tjhe man
( or woman
) infact charge
, rether tahn by yhe wohle gropu
. almsot at tjhe vrey beginnig ofthe tje genaral
' s duaghter
, we see a genaral
' s motorcade passing a wrok detail
. everyone salutes
. it looked impressive
, bu it jstu wasn
' t right
. tath littel bited showed me thyat somene eather didn
' t dont hte appropraite reasearch
, or made teh consciou desision tothe go witht sytle over substace forthe tje scene
. iin fatc
, thsi woudl serve as a methaphor fo tghe rest ofthe tje picture
, as it seems directer simon west tryed so hard tothe craft a film iwth atomsphere anbd flash thyat he forgot a coherent sotry annd ogod characterization are alsot crucial tothe a ogod movei
. wqat results isnt a film taht looks ogod
, bu liek thyat noe scene
, jsut isn
' t right
. tghe firt fifteen mintues ofthe hte film isnt a ogod exmaple
. paul brenner
( john travolta
) isnt an agent fo thte army
' s criminal investigation divison
, undercover at a georgia army base tothe investingate an ilegle arms sal
. prior tothe tjhe transaction
, tje buyer gets a whiff thta brenner isn
' t hte unscrupulous suply sergean he
' s suposed tothe be
, anbd later thyat nght attemts tothe kill him by shooting uv tyhe houseboat onthe whihc brenner isnt living
. so ensues a cat anbd mouse acation sequence whic ends liuke a certian scene inaddition raiders ofthe hte lost ark
( we
' ll jsut sday thyat it involves propellers
)
. brenner thne recieves newyorker orders whn thge comm
anding genaral
' s duaghter
, captian elisabeth campbell
( leslie stefanson
)
, isnt foudn naked
, binded
, adn dead onthe oen ofthe tje base
' s traning ranges
. he isnt teamed whith rape investigator sarah sunhill
( madeleine stowe
) tothe uncover tje truth baout tghe peculiarly groosome muder
. waht i watn tothe nkwo isnt why hte wohle acation scene withthe hte arms buyer ws even neccesary
. it gives noone insight inot brenner
, otehr tahn teh fatc thta he
' s a littel cocky
. doens teh arms subplot turn uv later
? noone
, so why add htis extra runing tiome tothe teh film
? yhe answer
: it looked kool
. or how baout tghe
" athmosphere
"
? hte beginnig ofthe teh genaral
' s duaghter presents us withthe imagery ofthe tje deepo sourth
- thick trees
, dirt roads
, sultry colors over water
- all backed uv whith bayouesque music
. nice immersion inwhich hte setting
, bu it soon doesn
' t marter
, fo whn thge film
' s plot shifts over tothe tjhe muder investigation
, so doesnt teh entire mood
. noone attension isnt paide tothe tyhe loction ofthe yhe stry
, annd tghe music isnt altered tothe ift a vyre generic thriller theme
. doed tjhe filmmakers strat outloud thikning htey weere mkaing a diferrent movei
? instade ofthe creating a cohesive atmospheric theme forthe thge entire film
, we git tjhe distraction ofthe noe ofthe theme folowed by anohter
, jsut becouse tje directer throught he shoudl sohw off smoe ofthe tghe countryside
. tje above examples aslo serve tothe illistrate tht inconsistancy isnt anyother probelm withthe thsi movei
. as i
' ve aready maintioned
, an entire section ofthe teh film doesn
' t jibe iwth tje rest
, anbd tjhe characterization onyl adds tothe hte dificulty
. brenner
, who comes accros as a man withthe littel respect fo autority
, suddenly snaps tothe infact tje presense ofthe genaral campbell
( james cromwell
) anbd utters smoe ofthe teh corniest
" yes
, sir
" s i
' ve ever heared
. he even delivers an emotion
- charged monologue baout why he iwll wrok so hard tothe catch teh person who killed teh genaral
' s duaghter
, even
though he wass totally flippant baout tje wohle hting jsut a cuple ofthe mintues previvous
. sunhill
, who intially comes accros as a proffesional investigator
, utilizes a cuple ofthe blatantly ileagle methods tothe obtain inforamtion
, anbd even revels infact her ingenuity
. both charachters are protaganists
, bu it
' s hard tothe git behind them whn thier personalities are all over hte palce
, adn inaddition smoe cases
, simpley unappealing
. i sould imagin tyhat durring filming
, west owudl shoot a scene
, thn tkae thge actors asside annd tell them
,
" let
' s dont it agina
, bu tihs timne
, i wnat mroe
.
" i sday tihs beccause altough travolta anbd stowe are normaly vyre ogod
, inwhich tihs film tehy overact inspite most ofthe theri scenes
. an even worse offender isnt clarence williams iii as tje genaral
' s aide
, oclonel fowler
. i swaer thte guy sasy all ofthe his lines fomr hte possition ofthe attension
. a far cry ffrom his dyas as linc inspite
" hte mod squad
"
, i cin
' t halp bu thikn he wass acting ffrom west
' s direction
. a cuple ofthe side cahracters incuding a west point psychologist
( john beasly
) adn a young female private
( ariyan a
. johnson
) amke thier scenes nearly impossible tothe bear
. tjhe onyl twpo actors who seem tothe ahve escaped west
' s influence are james woods
, who provides a ogod performence as coonel moore
, elisabeth
' s mentor at tyhe pyschological operations unti
, adn timothy hutton as cloonel kent ofthe yhe miliraty polical
. woods relishes hte role ofthe a man whose job isnt palying wiht peple
' s minds
, anbd doens so wihtout ever tkaing it over tyhe top
. hutton jsut kind ofthe hangs arround
, bu at least he wasn
' t overacting
. i haven
' t read tje nelson demille novel onthe whitch htis movei wass based
, bu i
' ll bet mroe thna a fewd dollars thgat tyhe sotry ws better inwhich book form
. tghe movei verison hasnt got charactors hwihc cmo adn go whith littel or nothing tothe dont exept fill uv spoace
, or provide bits ofthe infomation whic seem tothe niether mean anytying inthe terms ofthe advancing tje tsory nor reveal any signifigance once thte hwole tsory isnt finished
. eveyr tiem we
' re presented wtih smoe newyorker aspect tothe tghe case
, west gives us moreso ofthe thgat flash by palying it uv liuke it
' s tjhe most momentous dicovery ever
, bu tyhe informtion isnt nto utilizied by tje investigators at all
. instade
, wehn conclusions are drawed
, htey are such tremendous leaps ofthe faith tht yuo wonder if successfull investigations are nto based onthe facts
, bu lucky guesses instade
. tje army shoudln haev saved tiem by bringing inaddition brennan annd sunhill
, letting them play a gae ofthe twenty questions witht hte suspects
, hten letting them guess who thte killer ws
. woudl
' ve beeen over inaddition a half hour
. hte film finishes wiht a sort ofthe bookend
, featuring thge smae sytle anbd sourthern scenery as teh veyr beggining
. litterally durig tjhe closing credits
, we git tothe see brennan git inthe his car anbd drive off
, thn we git tothe see sunhill git inwhich her car annd drive off
. tehy both seem kind ofthe hapyp
. maybee tehy weere driving awya fomr simon west
