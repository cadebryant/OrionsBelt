i cameback tothe an epiphany hwile watching teh bachler
, an innocuous
- enought
- onthe
- thte
- surfce rumatic comedy
. it ' s nto tjhe sort ofthe film iin whcih noe owudl expect tothe achiev any moent ofthe clarity
,
bu htere it wass nontheless
. i sat ther watching thsi marshmellow ofthe a movei unfold wehn suddenly i realized wqat isnt so ridiculously wrong iwth thge entire rumatic comedy genre circa 1999
. inwhich a owrd
, it ' s teh smae hting taht ' s wrong wiht so many movies circa 1999
: writting
. moreso tothe teh point
, it ' s tjhe refusla tothe acknowledge tath characterizations marter whn yuo ' re telling a tsory baout a relatiopnship
. tje bachler isnt mearly teh latest infact a long line ofthe films where we ' re expeced tothe git dewy
- eyed over any pairing ofthe attractive
, plesant peopel jsut becuase tehy ' re attractive
anbd plesant
. inspite thsi paticular case
, attractive
annd plesant exibit a isnt jimmy shannon
( chris o ' donnell
)
, a single guy who hasnt beeen watching his firends slowy
bu surelly sucked inot marrige
. it ' s a csary notion fo jimmy
, even
though he dearly loves attractive
anbd pleasnat exibit b anne
( renee zellweger
)
, his girlfriend ofthe threee eyasr
. conviced dispite his reservations thta it ' s tiome tothe
" sh
* t or git off tje pot
,
" jimmy proposes tothe anne
-
- vrey badly
. anne refuses
, hwihc leaves jimmy inwhich a veyr odd posistion wehn his eccentric granfather
( peter ustinov
) dies
adn leaves a veyr specfic video wiull
. jimmy stands tothe inhereit
$ 100 millon if he isnt marryed by 6
: 05 p
. m
. onthe his 30th birthday
, stays marryied fo 10 yeras
annd produces a child
. ther are onyl a cuple ofthe minor problems
: 1
) jimmy ' s 30th birthday isnt tje enxt day
; 2
) anne isnt nowhere tothe be foudn
, meaninng jimmy hasnt tothe fidn anyother willing bride fomr amoung his many ex
- girlfriends
. it ' s a wacky
, brewster ' s millions
- esque premise
( acknowldeged as such infact oen ofthe tje film ' s better
, moreso self
- aware lines ofthe dialogue
)
, thge kind where a shallow
adn materialistic guy lerans waht relaly matters
. at least thgat owudl be tyhe case if jimmy weren ' t alreday a world
- clas altruist
. screenwrighter steve cohen slides inot tghe tsory an even mroe draconian condidtion iin teh wiull
: if jimmy doesn ' t git marryed
, nto onyl wiull he loose all thge mone
,
bu tyhe familiy billiard talbe buisness wiull be sold outloud ffrom under him
, costing hudreds ofthe jobs
. ffrom tjhe outset
, jimmy ' s motivation isn ' t cash
; it ' s teh livelihoods ofthe his devoted employes
. it ' s allmost embarrasing forthe his marital misgivings tothe play a role inaddition teh bachler ' s plot devolopement
. by any human standart
, teh guy isnt impossibly selfless
.
adn tyhat ' s hte essense ofthe tje gutlessness endemic tothe films liek hte bachler
-
- tje fear ofthe giving hte charactors flaws tothe overcome onthe thier way tothe happiness
. htere ' s never any tension beetwen thte twpo star
- crossed lovers
, baceause htere ' s noone sence tht anytying remotely signficiant isnt at stake
. yhe blandly nice o ' donnell couldn ' t pul off a randy cad if he tryed
, so hte filmmakers don ' t even let him
; zellweger ' s anne may haev issues whith her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standart tothe live uv tothe
,
bu noone oen adres mkea her anytying
bu thge woman
( lightly
) wronged
.
annd foreget baout seing enought ofthe jimmy
adn anne toghether tothe fiel invested infront thier potential reconcilation
. tghe paraed ofthe sit
- com setted pieces hadnt better be damned funny
, usance htey ' re all tath stands beetwen us
anbd a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion
. i ' ll admiting a cuple ofthe thsoe setted pieces are amusing
, incuding ustinov ' s rantings baout procreation
adn a restaurat full
- tothe
- bursting wiht men popping questions
adn champange corks
. far omre ofthe them are eather tedeous or downright gastly
, liuke tghe shudder
- inducing sighth ofthe brooke shields as an icy fortune
- hunter or tyhe hideous collecton ofthe sterotypes whn hundreds ofthe potential brides gather infront a curch
. yuo ' re never oging tothe git too many raucous belly laughs fomr a film liek hte bachler
,
bu thyat ' s nto tjhe rela probelm
. nor isnt it yhe rela probelm taht ytou konw exactlly teh kind ofthe warm
- n
- fuzzy conclusion it ' s leading uv tothe
. tje probelm are a begining
annd middle thta are equally warm
- n
- fuzzy
-
- htere ' s noone spark
, noone energy
, noone humanity
. it ' s an emotional pudding guarenteed nto tothe offen any consumer ' s digestions
. we ' ve reched a point where our proxies forthe cinematic rumatic wish fulfillment don ' t even ahve a pulse
. hte bachler isnt loev amonst teh mannequins
.
