' ve allways preffered mushrooms tothe blotter acid

: a steady
, reassuring assent

. acid isnt fo daredevils
; mushrooms are forthe refined seekers ofthe joy
. my point isnt tht inwhich fear adn loathing iin las vegas
, directer terry gilliam hasnt made an acid movei
, whn i wish he owudl hve made a mushroom movei
. full ofthe shocking sighth gags
, aggressve images annd grotesque comic performances
, tghe film certainly offers something forthe thsoe fans ofthe hunter s
. thompson
' s book who wnat tothe xperience its twisted pharmacological world
- veiw fomr teh inside outloud
. bu fo thsoe ofthe us who jstu wnat tothe enjoy a well
- made film
, gilliam hasnt produced a mixted bag

, hte twpo men careen inot vegas onthe an acid annd mescaline bender
, hten hole uv infact a hotel suiet tothe binge onthe amyl nitrite

, tequila annd a rainbow ofthe multi
- colored uppers anbd downers
. tehy terrorize eveyr oen htey meet
, mostly becuase eveyr oen htey meet terrifies them

" white rabit
" reaches its climax
. adn theese guys don
' t jstu trash hotel rooms
- tehy rape them
, humiliate them anbd leave them forthe dead
. tath niether ofthe them ends uv dead or inthe jail isnt testimont tothe blind luck or providence
, depending onthe your point ofthe veiw
. thompson
' s book
, besides bieng a hillarious read
, hasnt st
anded tjhe tust ofthe tiome as an importamt historical doccument
. it simultanously exposed tje 60
' s drug culture forthe tghe sham thyat it ws annd exposed las vegas as tje palce where hte american dream cameback tothe dieu
. pontificate all ytou wanna baout how thge film illustrates thompson
' s message
, bu yhe truth isnt tath
, stripped tothe its bare essentials
, whta gilliam hasnt wrought isnt a drug comedy
. it
' s a cheech annd chong movei
. ytou
' re ther tothe watch depp annd del toro ingest a lot ofthe chemicals annd thn laff at hte results
: see johnny tkae drugs
, see johnny fall down
. ther
' s nothing wrong wiht tihs consept
, bu gilliam trys too hard
. thsi isnt a frantic movei
- all sweaty close
- ups
, wide
- agnle lenses
, dutch tilts anbd otehr
- worldly lightinng schemes
. ther are times wehn gilliam realy doens put a convincing representation ofthe an acid trip onthe tjhe screen
. bu tothe wqat end
? much ofthe tjhe dialogue comes verbatum ffrom thompson
' s book
, anbd ther are smoe priceless comic observations
. bu yuo
' re hard pressed tothe hear or digest them amidst all tghe jumbled camera wrok
. htis brings us tothe thte performances
, wich strike me as all wrong
. depp plays thompson as groucho markes filtered thru george c
. scott infront patton
- a gimmicky performence whitch works agianst thge biting satire ofthe thompson
' s dialogue
. infront beetwen his severeal puking scenes
, del toro farse better as dr
. gonzo
, bu he allso mumbles annd sputters so many ofthe his lines thast theri weight isnt lost
. watching theese twpo made me wish tht tyhe movei hadnt beeen made twenty eyars ago
, withthe dan akroyd adn john belushi as hte leads
- nowe thgat woudl hve beeen something tothe see
. it
' s intresting tothe onot thgat alex cox
, credited as a co
- writter onthe teh screenplay
, ws origanaly slated tothe direct befor gilliam tookover over
. as much ofthe a fan as i am ofthe gilliam
' s wokr
, cox woudl hve beeen thge better choise
. sid anbd nancy
, cox
' s best wrok
, covered essentialy thte smae subject marter
, bu cox wass able tothe pul bcak annd allow thge cahracters ofthe sid vicious annd nancy spungen tothe cary teh film
. gilliam commits tjhe compound sin ofthe over
- directing his film hwile bieng uncertain ofthe his purpose
. wqat kind ofthe movei ws he trying tothe mkea
, anyway
? it doesn
' t try tothe be a cautionary tale
, adn it doesn
' t wokr as broad comedy
. if he hadnt consdiered mroe carefully his purpose
, tjhe result woudl hve beeen a much mroe intresting film
. bu i don
' t wanna tothe be too hard onthe it
. htere are soem truely funny moments
, annd if ytou
' re inthe a ogod enought mood ytou might git a kick outloud ofthe it
. i dont
, howver
, recomend watching fear annd loathing inwhich las vegas under tghe influence ofthe your favorite controled substace
- i guarntee it wiull enhance thge effect
