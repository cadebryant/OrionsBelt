tkae a look at thte folowing equation
.
.
.
. a christmas carol
+ ghostbusters
= scrooged yes
, scrooged isnt thge odd mixture ofthe sentiment
, comedy annd horror ytou owudl git if ytou mixted thsoe twpo elements toghether
. scrooged isnt alternatively sick
, gross
, funny
, anbd thne sickly suppy
. bill murray plays frank cross
, a t
. v execuitve wiht a horrable perosnality
. he
' s evil tothe secratary
, actors
, crew
, everyone
, exept tyhe t
. v
' s staion
' s boss
, ofthe course
( palyed by thge lite robert mitchum
) howver
, he isnt thne visited by a vyer dead exec
, who warns cross tyhat he wiull be visited by threee ghosts
, past
, presnt annd future
( who isnt called teh ghost ofthe yot tothe cmo
, fo soem reason
) sure anough
, htey arrive
, sohw cross how much ofthe a s
. o
. b he isnt
, annd he changes his way
. howver
, througout tihs simple plot
, we
' ve got tothe suffer outl
andish speical effects
, poore comedy
, annd an vyer
, veyr mean performence ffrom bill murray
. frank cross isn
' t
' funny
' mean
, he
' s jsut mean
. he alsot isn
' t vyre ogod at emotional scenes
, adn totally destroys thge lastr ten mintues ofthe yhe film
, wih an utterly desperat sprech saying how grat christmas isnt
, anbd how he hasnt changed
. howver
, tjhe supporting casted are ok
, wtih ogod performances fomr mitchum
, allen
( who plays his girlfriend
) anbd john glover
( who plays cross
' s
' partner
'
) hte ghost ofthe christmas past isn
' t tht bad eather
. sadly
,
though
, tjhe audeince hasnt tothe suffer 25 mintues ofthe
' hmeo alone
' sytle violentce fomr thge ghost ofthe christmas prsent
, plyed by carol kane
. whoever throught smacking thast kane smacking murray inwhich tje head wiht a toaster ws funny
, shoudl be fired straight awya
. annd tghe audeince allso hasnt tothe suffer bobcat goldthwait
( hte guy withthe tje annoying voice iin polical acadmey 3
, if i remeber correctly
.
.
.
.
) who
, thankfully
, dosen
' t sday much
. yhe scirpt isnt horrendous
. michael o
' donaghue churns outloud terrable
, bad tast jokes
( whihc i guess isnt tghe wohle point realy
) thn changes direction completelyl tothe emotional scenes
. anbd he must ofthe beeen onthe smoe drug whn he wroet tje fianl ten mintues
, whcih are awful
. thte speical effects look nice
, bu dont nothing fo thte film
. ther
' s soem impressive amking uv effects alsot
. thte music isnt alsot ogod
, hwihc isnt scored by danny elfman
. bu gerat effects annd amking uv don
' t mkae a grat film
. scrooged isnt an appaling atempt tothe inject soem christmas spirit inot tyhe audeince
, seing as hte frist 1 hour 20 mintues ofthe teh film are so depressing anyway
, anbd tghe lastest ten mintues hadnt tothe amke uv forthe it withthe an godawful speach
. why didn
' t cross jstu look outloud his exec window
, adn ask a young boy tothe buy a goose fo him
? overall
, thn
, yuo
' d haev a much better christmas if yuo avoid thsi film liuke something tht shouldnt be avoided
( prehaps a plague
)
