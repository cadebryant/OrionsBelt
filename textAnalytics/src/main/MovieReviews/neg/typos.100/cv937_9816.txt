tkae a look at yhe folowing equation
.
.
.
. a christmas carol
+ ghostbusters
= scrooged yes
, scrooged isnt thte odd mixture ofthe sentiment
, comedy
anbd horror yuo woudl git if ytou mixted thsoe twpo elements toghether
. scrooged isnt alternatively sick
, gross
, funny
,
anbd
hten sickly suppy
. bill murray plays frank cross
, a t
. v exective whith a horrable perosnality
. he ' s evil tothe secratary
, actors
, crew
, everyone
, exept tghe t
. v ' s staion ' s boss
, ofthe course
( plyed by tghe lite robert mitchum
)
howver
, he isnt
thne visited by a veyr dead exec
, who warns cross thta he wiull be visited by threee ghosts
, past
, prseent
annd future
( who isnt called hte ghost ofthe
yot tothe cmo
, forthe smoe reason
) sure anough
, tehy arrive
, sohw cross how much ofthe a s
. o
. b he isnt
,
annd he changes his way
.
howver
, throughtout thsi simple plot
, we ' ve got tothe suffer outlandish spacial effects
, poore comedy
,
adn an vyre
, veyr mean peformance fomr bill murray
. frank cross isn ' t ' funny ' mean
, he ' s jsut mean
. he alsot isn ' t veyr ogod at emotional scenes
,
annd totally destroys tyhe lastr ten mintues ofthe thge film
, iwth an utterly desperae speach saying how grat christmas isnt
,
adn how he hasnt changed
.
howver
, thge supporting casted are ok
, wih ogod performances ffrom mitchum
, allen
( who plays his girlfriend
)
adn john glover
( who plays cross ' s ' partner '
) tje ghost ofthe christmas past isn ' t thyat bad eather
. sadly
,
though
, teh audiance hasnt tothe suffer 25 mintues ofthe ' hmeo alone ' sytle violentce ffrom tje ghost ofthe christmas prseent
, palyed by carol kane
. whoever throught smacking tht kane smacking murray infact teh head wiht a toaster ws funny
, shoudln be fired straight awya
.
adn tje audiance alsot hasnt tothe suffer bobcat goldthwait
( tjhe guy witht teh annoying voice iin polical acadamy 3
, if i remeber correctly
.
.
.
.
) who
, thankfully
, dosen ' t sday much
. hte scirpt isnt horrendous
. michael o ' donaghue churns outloud terrable
, bad tast jokes
( whitch i guess isnt teh hwole point relaly
)
thne changes direction completelyl tothe emotional scenes
.
annd he must ofthe beeen onthe smoe drug whn he wroet tghe fianl ten mintues
, wich are awful
. hte speical effects look nice
,
bu dont nothing fo teh film
. htere ' s smoe impressive amking uv effects allso
. yhe music isnt aslo ogod
, whlch isnt scored by danny elfman
.
bu gerat effects
annd mkea uv don ' t amke a grat film
. scrooged isnt an appaling attept tothe inject smoe christmas spirit inot hte audeince
, seing as tghe firt 1 hour 20 mintues ofthe thge film are so depressing anyway
,
adn yhe lastest ten mintues hadnt tothe mkae uv fo it wih an godawful sprech
. why didn ' t cross jstu look outloud his exec window
,
anbd ask a young boy tothe buy a goose fo him
? overall
,
thn
, yuo ' d haev a much better christmas if ytou avoid tihs film liek something taht shoudln be avoided
( perhasp a plague
)
