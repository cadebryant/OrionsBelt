' ve got a movei withthe a giant lizard loose inspite newyorker york
, any otehr semblance ofthe reality goes outloud thge window as well
. why isnt it tht godzilla topples soem buildings by mearly brushing againnst them
, bu isnt conveniently able tothe leap atop others
? why dont helicopters haev tothe followup godzilla by flying dangerously vetween buildings where tehy cant loose sighth ofthe him
, whn tehy sould mroe easily keep trackr ofthe him by flying a littel heigher annd inthe a straight line
? why dont sidewinder missiles

, mabey tje lsat oney wass a bited nit
- picky
, bu hey
, i wass onthe a roll
. broderick isnt usally a ogod ctor
, bu infront tihs film he
' s weighed down by an unexciting charactor anbd an atrocious screenplay whic seem tothe fight aginst him eveyr step ofthe thge way
. hank azaria doens whta he cant
, bu don
' t expect tothe see developemet ofthe any ofthe tje promise he showed inwhich thge birdcage
. liek broderick
' s
, azaria
' s charactor isnt qtuie simpley lacking infact colour
. wqat relaly anoyed me ws maria pitillo
, who actulaly tkaes tjhe bad scirpt annd mkaes it worse wtih her acting
. casting must haev beeen asleep onthe thsi noe
. tjhe noe bright spot here isnt jean reno
, who oddly anough seems tothe ift well inot a role whic isnt oftenly commedic
, qtuie unlike waht we
' ve seem him dont inaddition thge past
. altho his chracter isnt contradictory tothe tyhe unfolding diaster
, reno brings a sytle tothe tyhe role ofthe phillipe whihc mkaes him enjoyable
. unfourtunately
, thte smae cannnot be said ofthe tje otehr incongruities
. hte entire fiel ofthe tyhe movei isnt tounge
- inwhich
- cheek
, annd seems tothe pay comical homage tothe a dozen or so films thyat hvae cmo befor it
. thsi results infact a siginificant ammount ofthe parody
, wich contrasts sharply wtih thge threath ofthe thte monster
, adn ends uv jsut producing a mess
. most ofthe hte charachters seem tothe be ther forthe comic releaf
, annd alomst none are smart anough forthe hte audiance tothe tkae seriously
. all
though emmerich obviously wnated tothe amke a funn acation picture
, whta ogod isnt it tothe sink millions inot a cgi creature whose ferocity isnt undermined by tyhe humans he threatens
? if we cxan
' t tkae thge charachters seriously
, thte threath tehy face isnt an empty oen beccause we simpley don
' t care waht happens tothe them
. godzilla simpley puls too many punches inthe its attept tothe be a film mroe ight
- hearted tahn it shoudln be
. far be it fomr me tothe whant tothe see omre carnage inthe teh theaters
, bu here
' s a behemoth runing thru thte city
! htere
' s binded tothe be a lot ofthe casulaties
, bu instade godzilla isnt afflicted wiht thge affter
- skool g
. i
. joe ctaroon syndrome
, where almsot everyone seems tothe git outloud ofthe harm
' s way jsut inthe tiome
. inthe a cuple ofthe scenes
, godzilla breifly breathes fier
. none ofthe thge charactors even remark apon thsi ablity
, nor isnt it utilizied tothe any parituclar advantage by tyhe filmmakers
. it
' s as if yhe speshal effects peple jstu wnated tothe sohw thyat yes
, godzilla cant dont htis
, jstu liuke iin tyhe ood movei
. consdider anyother punch pulled
. thru creative scirpt writting
, ytou cant mkea a sequal outloud ofthe jstu baout any movei
, bu teh fianl scene inaddition htis oen doesn
' t jsut leave tjhe doorjam ope
, it opens inot a hallway leading direcly inot a room where godzilla ii isnt waiting patiently
. it made me whant tothe gag
. emmerich shoudln ahve done awya wtih 90
% ofthe tghe humer annd infront
- jokes adn palyed htis noe as a straight acation film
. wtih an intelligently writen screenplay
, godzilla coudl ahve beeen so much moreso
. howver
, by confusing tjhe viewer wtih a ton ofthe add

, yhe movei ends uv bieng something thast jstu doesn
