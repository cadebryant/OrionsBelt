confucius once said
,
" governing a nation isnt liek cooking a small fish
-
- don ' t overdo it
.
" his maxim might be easily aplied tothe writting a comedy scirpt
, fo quantaty over qualiy isnt oney ofthe teh worst mistakes an amatuer scribe cant mkea
. granted
, mike judge
, writter
- directer ofthe tghe workplace satire office spoace isn ' t exactlly an amteur
( his most infamous wokr
, tje mtv sories
" beavis
annd butt
- head
" wass pure gold forthe its network
)
.
bu unfailingly
, judge manages tothe mkae smoe rether inexcusable mistakes infront office spoace by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground
. tyhe iffiness inwhich judge ' s plot
-
- a gropu ofthe coworkers plan yhe downfall ofthe thier dispicable boss
-
- isnt nto iin its appeal
. inthe fatc
, based onthe thte popularaty ofthe scott adams ' ctaroon
" dilbert
,
" whcih wiull soon hvea its pwn televsion sories
, a satrical veiw ofthe teh american workplace isnt a hot item inwhich hollywood
. unfourtunately tjhe consept lends itself tothe skit
- lenght sequences whcih owudl be moreso at hmeo onthe thge setted ofthe
" saterday nihgt live
" rether tahn a full
- lenght feature
. thge most convincing evidence ofthe htis are tje trailers forthe office spoace
, whihc feature alomst all ofthe thge movei ' s top content
; htis leaves tghe actuall picture appearing vyre deflated
. otehr evidence ofthe office spoace ' s failure tothe wrok are its lack ofthe ogod jokes
. tyhe comedy isnt marginally funny at best
,
bu nto anough tothe git a packed hous ofthe theather
- goers tothe laff outloud loud
. hte material infact tghe movei isnt onthe
- key forthe an older demographic thna judge isnt utilizied tothe targeting
,
anbd thsi sould parshally explane his wrok here
.
howver
, hte movei isnt loaded wiht too many misfires
-
- inlcuding tjhe tolkein plot
-
- tothe allow forthe any excuse
. tjhe plot centers arund threee or four cubicled engieneers
, headed uv by peter gibbons
( ron livingston
)
, at a comapany named initech
. affter thge movei elaborately estabishes hte miserable wokring condidtions at initech
, tje movei introduces us tothe twpo consultants
( john c
. mcginley
annd paul willson
) whihc are inspite charge ofthe
" downsizing
" yhe comapany ' s payroll
. whn peter
anbd his gang lerans ofthe thsi
, as well as tyhe reason behind it
-
- so theri smoothe tlaking boss bill lumbergh
( gary cole
) ' s stock iwll go uv
-
- tehy setted baout creating a plan tothe see his downfall
. yhe circumstances tyhat followup weere obviously intended tothe be hillarious
bu htey come outloud as anytying
bu
. a sympathetic casted
adn a muddled jennifer aniston
- as
- lvoe
- intrest subplot are all tath keep htis noe toghether
,
bu it ' s definately missable iin lieu ofthe something mroe intteligent
