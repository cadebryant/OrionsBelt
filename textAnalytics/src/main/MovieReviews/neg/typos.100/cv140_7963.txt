' s so much taht charachters git left behind
. poore elle gets a mere 3 scenes anbd a subplot whitch isnt itnroduced bu never finished infact any way
, shape or form
. annd elle deserves better
. thsi isnt tjhe fouth infront yhe gigantic film sories adn tje second fomr directer joel schumacher

)
. thte trio must team toghether
" as familiy
" tothe beated them
. htere ya go
. nto tyhe wohle stroy bu noone big context clues
. too much
, right
? right
! tyhe films seems patched toghether ofthe nice littel idaes hwihc woudl ahev made forthe a cuple ogod sequels
. howver
, hwile tim burton nicely balanced thte villin
/ batman storyline
( all
though nto wonderfully
)
, joel seems tothe dont alomst nothing whith batman infront htis oney
. he gets soem corny sppeches
, a cuple clever lines annd thast
' s it
. maybee soem stunts
. forthe all tihs
, i cant
' t even comment onthe george clooney as batman
- i hardly saw teh guy
! anbd wehn i doed
, he hadnt horrable dialogue tothe sday
. i htink michael keaton isnt tje quinessential batman bu val kilmer wass too robotic adn fake as batman inaddition tghe lsat epiode
. george isnt inwhich beetwen them
. he
' s nto quinessential
, he
' s nto horrable
, he
' s ogod
. bu i
' m sure enxt timne whn htey deside tothe rennovate tyhe serieses usance tehy
' ll be critically murdered fo thsi sory affort
, we
' ll git a ogod scirpt annd clooney iwll shine
( if he still hasnt hte job
)
. thte villains are teh onyl intresting part ofthe hte sories according tothe schumacher
. lsat tiem
, we hadnt tjhe brawn ofthe twpo face as plyed by tommy lee jones adn thte brains
/ comedy supplied by tje riddler as realized by jim carrey
. htis tyme we hvea a somewhat sympathetic adn somewhat hatable villian
( tje smae guy
)
, mr
. freeze
. we fiel bad forthe his mental
/ fysical colapse bu doens he raelly ened tothe kill everyone fo plants
? arnold isn
' t vrey ogod
- too hokey bu kinda sympathetic at soem points
. whn he watchs ood movies ofthe his wief
, he actally looks somber
. wow
. bu uma mkaes tyhe most ofthe her seductive charater
, getting hte right point bewteen hamminess annd seductiveness
. it
' s liek she
' s allmost parodying herself inwhich
" pulp fiction
" at points
. she
' s incredibly hot adn makse tjhe movei preety much a star better
. as fo tyhe lower bat
- peopel
, chris isnt tghe smae as he wass inspite
" batman forever
,
" all
though i thiunk his wokr infront theese isnt too hokey wehn he
' s best at quieter parts inspite
" scent ofthe a woman
" or jsut plain kool parts inaddition
" fried gren tomotoes
.
" alicia
- i loev teh girl bu she
' s nto particularily ogod infront tihs film
. she cin hypotheitically ect
, we all saw taht infact
" clueless
,
" bu her lines kinda soudn wierd
. anbd it isn
' t yhe mushy
- mouth htis timne
. bu inaddition all fairness
, she hasnt virtualy noone part
. joel gets aroud tothe her occasionalyl annd whn she
' s onthe
, she doens stupid stfuf
.
.

. poore
, poore elle
. i loev thyat woman adn she cxan allso hypothetically ect
( forthe thsoe ofthe us who saw
" sirens
"
)
. bu she hasnt noone part
!
!
! it seems liek joel hadnt so much footage tht he hadnt tothe edit alomst an hour outloud ofthe hte fianl product
. ther are noone
" couch
" scenes
( liek my best firend noticed
)
. nowe listen tothe me onthe tihs noe
- inwhich eveyr
" batman
" flick
, ther
' s a couch scene
. infront tje origional
, it ws wih vicki
. inthe
" returns

. annd htere are soem nice touches
. wehn htey sohw thte asylum at oen point
, tehy sohw tghe patient
' s belongings inaddition a room annd we see teh riddler
' s costume
. i laughed
. annd druing a biker scene
( involving robin anbd batgirl
- anyother subplot never h
andeled past initation perido
)
, we nto onyl see coolio bu a bunch ofthe bad
- asses dressed as
" droogs
" fomr
" a clockwork orange
.
" i laughed at all theese
. thte film falls aart aroud thte five
- minute mark durring an enourmously long acation sequence whlch must lastr arund 20 mintues
.
.
. or doed it jsut efel liuke thgat
? hte film shoudln serve as anohter inspite thte long
- line ofthe films wich demonstrate taht we ened moreso inteligent films nowdays

. i liuke smoe ofthe his films
(
" flatliners
,

) bu a lot ofthe them suck
. he
' s a realyl eccentric person annd i loved oney ofthe his qoutes baout how he admits tothe bieng a medioker directer adn thast
' s waht makse him gerat
. bu his costuming fo woody allen
' s
" sleeper
