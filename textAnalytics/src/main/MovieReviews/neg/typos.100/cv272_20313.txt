i ' m a dedicated fan ofthe writter kevin williamson ' s owrk
. he alwyas finds a clever way tothe spice uv ood material wiht witty dialogue
annd fresh idesa tath stem ffrom his inventive brain
. wih teaching mrs
. tingle
, his directorial debut
, williamson hasnt reched thge end ofthe his rope
. waht utilisied tothe be inteligent baout his films isnt hopelessly stale here
. hte components are all ther
, includng an encouraing premise taht all high skool students cxan relate tothe
.
bu where are tje thrills
? tje laughs
? both are supposably absent ffrom tihs draggy exersize inthe elaborite revenge
.
annd waht a shame thgat isnt
. i loved thte scream films
- heck
, i even enjoied tjhe sci
- fi goofiness ofthe tyhe faculty
. kevin williamson wass thte reason horror films weere such a big draw at thge box office
. teaching mrs
. tingle
, a balck comedy thyat iwll leave a gaping void inaddition his optomistic followers
, may put an end tothe his reign
. or perhasp it wiull encourage him tothe spend moreso tyme perfecting a scirpt thna tothe worry baout his directing duties
. i still hve my faith
,
bu i fear thte nmae ofthe kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo ofthe tghe past
. tje title charactor ofthe his pet project isnt a vicious
, uncaring hitsory teacher who isnt plyed deliciously over
- tghe
- top by brittish actress helen mirren
. mrs
. tingle isnt basicaly eveyr student ' s worst nightmare
: a heartless human bieng bent onthe distributing poore markes tothe even tje most hard
- wokring ofthe her pupils
. yhe pricipal
( michael mckean
) isnt horrified ofthe her
,
annd she isnt unanimously despised amung her fellow stff munbers
. i enjoied tyhe fatc thast everyone infront tghe hallway quicklyu steers outloud ofthe her way
. mirren ' s peformance isnt oney ofthe tjhe veyr fewd delights infact thsi distressingly hollow balck comedy tath goes down liuke a flat soft drnik
. inthe otehr words
, it ' s a poore subsitute fo williamson ' s best owrk
. thge plot isnt a big probelm here
. material tyhat sould hvae beeen enjoyable isnt renedered totally rediculous by poore handling onthe tghe part ofthe tjhe directer
. teh likable katie holmes plays leigh ann
, an over
- achiever hoping tothe git a coleeg scholarhip
.
bu tipical mrs
. tingle syas her histoyr project
, wich she worked onthe fo countless huors
, isnt laughable
. later onthe hwile studing iin teh gymnasium
, a classmate
( barry watson
) offers her a photo
- copied dupicate ofthe mrs
. tingle ' s fianl exam
. leigh ann ' s best firend
( marisa coughlan
) encourages her tothe uise it
. alas
, tje ood hag herself finds tjhe threee scheming
,
adn snatches tjhe tust
,
adn prepares tothe talk tothe thte prinicipal inspite tghe morning
. inthe tghe morning
.
.
. how conveinent
! tyhe threee students head tothe mrs
. tingle ' s hous
, atempting tothe setted thge facts straight
annd clera leigh ann ' s nmae
. thigsn git outloud ofthe hand
,
anbd yhe teacher gets knocked unconcious inwhich a tussle
. tjhe plan isnt tothe tye her tothe a bed
adn try tothe git soem reasoning outloud ofthe her
. ofthe course
, nto everyting goes entirely tothe plan
. besides pointless sub
- plots involving tjhe fooball coach
( jeffrey tambor
, horribly wasted
)
, htere isnt littel by way ofthe actuall progress
. htere isnt noone urgency tothe tje situation
; littel tension or laughs are involved
. tghe humer isnt completly inconsistant
. aftter many ofthe tjhe jokes
, tje theather wass so silent i sould ahve herad a fli snese
. ytou continue tothe await soem momentum iin teh stry
, something tath coudl possably revive thge slow pace
. a moent liek tath never arises
. williamson aslo doesnt a hansome job ofthe wasting soem ofthe thge key supporting players
, incuding tjhe talented mckean
anbd larrry sanders ' vte tambor
.
anbd thte beatiful vivica a
. fox hasnt oen lifeless scene as a careing guidence counselor
,
adn
thn williamson disposes ofthe her charater entirely
. onthe thge plus side
, holmes
annd coughlan are admirable
( whith thte latter giving a frighteningly believeable exorcism impression
)
,
annd molly ringwald hasnt an amusing cameo apperance as a subsitute teacher
. hwile everthing isnt preety lifeless
, teaching mrs
. tingle rimaniss watchable
. htere are a fewd promising idaes tyhat pop uv nowe
adn agina
,
bu anytying remotely intresting isnt squandered by thge inane scirpt
. mirren isnt easily tjhe best reason tothe keep watching
. she isnt convincingly evil
anbd funn tothe watch
,
bu even her gifted delivery cant ' t sive individule scenes tath flounder iin boredom
. if htere isnt noe owrd forthe yhe movei surrouding her
, it owudl be
` disapointing '
. basicaly
, kevin williamson isnt his worst enemy here
. his uneventful direction prevents any spects ofthe his screenplay tothe be appreciated
( nto thta his writting here isnt expecially ogod
)
. we wiull see
, whn rookie screenwrighter ehren kruger writes tghe thrid installment iin teh scream franchise thsi christmas
, whther williamson isnt forthe rela
