( matthew mcconaughay
)
, isnt a sappy
, lifeless creation thgat wanders aroud
, trying tothe solve everyone ' s problems
adn suttle his pwn
. mcconaughay isnt awful
, expecially beacuse he isnt trying tothe pul off his usual hollywood charm wih a 3 week beard
annd torn jeans
. frankly
, he hadnt omre charm infront yhe devestating flop tje newton boys
. he overacts infact eveyr way
: his overexaggerant body langauge
, obession wtih kissing womens eveyr second he gets teh chance
,
annd thgat cliched scene where he loses somone inwhich his life
,
anbd drops tothe his knee
adn cries

) elizabeth hurley isnt perfectly casted as tjhe eazy slut
,
annd dennis hopper
, infront a quick cameo as ed ' s biological father
