, especialy becouse he isnt trying tothe pul off his usual hollywood charm iwth a 3 week beard anbd torn jeans
. frankly
, he hadnt mroe charm infact thte devestating flop tyhe newton boys
. he overacts inwhich eveyr way
: his overexaggerant body laguage
, obession withthe kissing womens eveyr second he gets teh chance
, adn taht cliched scene where he loses somone infact his life
, annd drops tothe his knee adn cries

anded outloud as teh executiev who
, aftter awhile
, decides tghe sohw must nto go onthe much tothe tghe oposite ofthe teh head exec
