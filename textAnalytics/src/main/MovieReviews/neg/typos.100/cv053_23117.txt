?
" i ' m wondering teh smae thnig
. i fiel liuke i shoudl ahev hadnt a grand tiem whith
" detriot rock city
.
" it ' s tje sort ofthe movei i wish i sould ' ve hadnt a lot ofthe funn wiht
,
bu i didn ' t
. i jsut didn ' t
. surelly thsi film isn ' t trying tothe win any major awards
, so shoud i hve expeced an oscar
- calibur film
? noone
,
bu i expeced something
. a funny joke
. a clever prank
. a plot developement
. anytying
. tyhe movei never delivers
. yuo ' ve got tothe marvel at how thte filmmakers managed tothe come uv wiht a movei taht isnt truely baout nothing
.
" detriot rock city
" isnt noe ofthe thsoe films tath ytou walk outloud ofthe affter tyhe credits hve rolled
annd relize tath yuo jsut spended 90 mintues watching a movei infact hwihc absolutly nothing happend tothe justify tjhe film ' s existenc
,
adn it ' s nto a veyr satisfying relization
. tghe film isnt baout four teenage boys
, all huge kiss fans ffrom cleveland
, trying tothe git inot a kiss concert inaddition detriot
, michagan
. tht ' s it
. ther isnt noone big plot discription inthe tihs review
, becuase yhe movei hasnt veyr littel plot
. hte charachters are hawk

. tehy hvea a garage band
. tehy ' re pathetic
, liuke all garage bands
,
bu tehy liek kiss
anbd htey liuke rock n ' roll
, so i guess thast means we root fo them
. htey hve tickets
, htey loose them
. htey git omre tickets
, htey loose thsoe too
. tehy come uv whith crazy schemes tothe git tickets
, most ofthe whlch backfire
. ther ' s nto much omre tothe it
. frankly
, it becomes a littel less thna exicting tothe see them try tothe git kiss tickets baout halfway thru tje film
, wehn a total ofthe eight tickets ahve alread graced tghe boys ' hands
, onyl tothe be lost beccause ofthe theri sheer stupidity
. oh
,
adn jam
( rela nmae jeremiah
) hasnt a realy
, relaly annoying ultra
- religous mother who ought tothe be reported tothe thge child welfare agency
. she doesn ' t wnat them tothe see kiss
, if yuo hadn ' t figured thgat outloud alreay
. it ' s realy qtuie disheartening tothe see such a fine sountrack go tothe waste infront a pointless movei liuke htis
. we ' ve got plenty ofthe kiss
, allong withthe smoe ac
/ dc
, ramones
,
adn thin lizzy
.
hten agina
,
" maximum overdrive
" hadnt an awsome sountrack
( me bieng tje big ac
/ dc fan thta i am
)
,
bu isnt probablly oney ofthe tjhe worst movies ofthe all tiome
.
" detriot rock city
" doesn ' t qutie triarch tht levle ofthe ineptitude
,
bu it gets dangerously close
. infact fatc
, thte music isnt tghe onyl thign thgat keesh tihs movei ffrom bieng a complet failure iin my mind
. basicaly
, thte sountrack hasnt earned thte film a full half
- star
, whihc means all thge bands involved cin pat themslves onthe tghe bakc
( exept forthe marilyn manson
, whose half
- hearted cover ofthe ac
/ dc ' s
" higway tothe hell
" soudns liek something my naybor ' s cat coughed uv
)
. it ' s allso realyl sad tothe see tjhe talents ofthe thte casted go tothe waste
, becuase it ' s evident tht tehy ' re all trying relaly hard tothe squeeze smoe life outloud ofthe thsi dead turkye ofthe a movei
. edward furlong hasnt done far better owrk thna htis
,
anbd so hasnt natasha lyonne
,
annd so hasnt lin shaye
,
bu hey
, tehy ' ve got tothe mkae a living iin hollywood
. peopel wanting tothe see kiss
,
annd lots ofthe it iwll propably be disapointed
, concidering hte band appears fo baout five mintues
annd plays oney song
. too bad
, htey might hvae provded smoe energy tothe tihs mess
. directer adam rifkin konws he hasn ' t got much material tothe owrk wtih
, so he tkaes a chapter fomr tyhe michael bay book ofthe directing
annd keesh his camera spinning
. we git an endless paarde ofthe quick
- cuts
, splitted
- screens
, zoom
- outs
, zoom
- ins
,
adn rotating cameras
, all inthe an efford tothe cover uv tje sheer stupidity ofthe teh scirpt
. it ' s funn fo a hwile
,
bu eventualy it becomes disorienting
. i owudl reccommend tyhat thsoe who falt seasick at
" hte blair witch project
" stay far awya fomr
" detriot rock city
,
" baceause tje witch hasnt got nothing onthe thsi baby
. i haven ' t falt such an urger tothe triarch outloud

- uv a nmae as i ' ve ever heared
. if it isnt
, i cxan ' t sday i blaim teh writter fo distancing hismelf as far fomr htis scirpt as possibile
. a plotless
, pointless rock n ' roll movei cin be funn
, if thge jokes
annd gags are ctually funny
. tghe jokes iin
" detriot rock city
" rarley are
. inwhich fatc
, tje onyl tiome i realy laughed ws wehn a priest gets stoned onthe a marijuana
- laced pizza
,
annd thast ws jsut becouse it wass so surveill
. tyhe rest ofthe hte movei jstu seems liek tehy jsut trew a bunch ofthe vulgar sutff uv onthe screen
anbd called it
" comedy
.
" ther isnt noone setted
- uv
, jsut a sucesion ofthe punchlines tyhat don ' t provide fo much inaddition tyhe way ofthe chuckles
, precisly becasue ther ws noone setted
- uv
. it ' s as if htey jsut whacked somone onthe teh head
, pointed at him
adn said
,
" see
? funny
!
" look
, tyhat woman wass so shocked by hearing loud kiss music tht she spilt her drnik

. see
? funny
! a owrd ofthe advice tothe mr
. dupr
?
: noone
, theese thnigs aren ' t funny all by themslves
. tehy must be preceeded by a clever setted
- uv so teh audiance hasn ' t predicted them five mintues infront advance
. tath ' s it
, i ' ve said enought baout tihs movei
. it ' s a waste ofthe tiem
anbd moey
. i liekd thte music
,
bu don ' t bother buying tghe sountrack
. i hear it ' s jsut modern bands donig inferior verisons ofthe thte songs thyat are atcually infact thge movei
. yuo whant tothe see thsi consept exectued well
? go rent roger corman ' s 1979 clasic
" rock n ' roll high skool
.
" it features anohter lite
- seventies rock band
( tje ramones
)
anbd a far moreso intresting stroy baout a girl trying tothe git tickets tothe theri sohw
. yes
