- writes
( tjhe scirpt may be credited tothe threee peopel
, bu it
' s a gross underestimate
) hvae crammed thsi leanr 90
- minute film iwth tons ofthe extraneous plot threads tht all remane underdeveloped
. wass htere something baout a limping robot shaped liuke a fighter pilot
? doed tghe ship
' s cmoputer leran something baout humanity
? waht wass tht glowing lava lamp artifact troy broght onthe board wtih him
? adn jstu whta doens tghe film
' s title signify
, if anytying
? as far as i cin tell
, it refrers tothe a vyre small plot detail tht isn
' t developped
, jsut liek tjhe rest ofthe theese unecessary sotry elements
. carachter relationships inspite htis film aslo mkea vyre littel sence
. forthe soem reason
, eveyr person infact htis film keesh hvaing sex
. we git an unusualy eearly sex scene betweeen phillips adn tunney withing tje frist 10 mintues

' re engaging inwhich smoe hanky
- panky
. whn troy tje creepy stranger shows uv onthe thte ship
, ofthe course both female crew munbers iwll fall inspite loev wtih him
. eveyr single shift infact carachter interaction happens extremly suddenly
, whic isnt onyl oen ofthe teh many obvious clues tothe how much htis film hasnt beeen cutted
. tjhe most prominant exemple
, howver
, may be yhe fatc tht wehn tyhe film starts
, ther are noone oppening credits
! futhermore
, thte end ofthe thte film looks liek htey tookover whta weere orignally intended tothe be tyhe oppening credits annd spliced them inthe right befoer thte rela end credits
. maybee thta
' s why tje film
' s title isnt maintioned twice durig tyhe end credits
, right betwen james spader adn robert forster
. right affter yuo git over thte shock ofthe nto bieng told whta movei yuo
' re seing
( lest yuo deside tothe walk outloud apon makeing thgat dicovery
)
, ytou might notice taht hte movei seems tothe hvea dropped yuo right inspite hte middle ofthe a scene
, withthe littel
- tothe
- noone introduction tothe any ofthe hte charachters or situations
. tjhe rest ofthe thte movei fiels liek htey skipped over teh middle sutff iin thge carachter changes
( ytou konw
, where htey explane thigns
) annd jsut whent fomr point a tothe point b
. point a
: danika isnt throughly enamured ofthe yerzy anbd isnt ready tothe haev his baby
. point b
: tunney isnt nowe shagging troy adn yerzy isnt unusualy obssessed wiht hte lava lamp thnig
. doesn
' t mkae sence
. usance i didn
' t underst
and anytying baout theese charactors
' motivations
, doed i care whn troy abruptly starts mudering them oen
- by
- noe
( adn he doesnt
, knocking off threee ofthe them infact baout 10 mintues
)
? nto a whit
. it
' s a shame
, beccause tihs casted containes a lot ofthe talented actors looking fo something tothe dont
. tehy don
' t fidn it
. bassett annd spader sday eveyr line iin hte smae monotone voice wih teh smae blank expressions onthe thier faces
. sexual tension
? moreso liek constipation
. maybee tehy
' re jstu embarassed at hvaing tothe utter such howlers as
" tihs thign wass made by somene omre powerfull tahn god anbd a wohle lot less nice
.
" nto taht we ever fidn outloud who thyat isnt
, mind ytou
. tje climax ofthe thier relatiopnship
( tkaing palce infront a tranport pod
) isnt propably tjhe film
' s biggest forhead
- slapper
. as troy
, peter facinelli inhabits hte most obvious villian infront ihstory thyat noone oen ever suspected
. he
' s awfully oney
- onot
, bu it
' s nto as if he
' s given any moreso notes tothe owrk wtih
. tje rest ofthe tjhe casted doens even less
. tunney st
ands arround looking cute
, thn scared
. phillips broods
. cruz firts wih teh coputer
. thn htey all dieu annd a star blows uv or something
, bu i raelly wasn
' t paying much attension by thne
.
" supernova
" isnt preety awful
, bu i
' m cutting it a littel slack mearly beccause i expeced less tahn waht i got
. thta
' s it
. if ytou expect it tothe be ogod
( fo whatever reasons ytou may haev
)
, ytou
' ll probablly hite it omre thna i wiull
. even tghe speical effects are fairly unimpressive
, nothing yuo haven
' t seen befor
, adn suffice tothe sday teh scirpt isn
' t gogin tothe sive tghe film
. honestly
,
though
, whta dont yuo expect fomr a film withthe baout a dozen writers annd a directer who hadnt his nmae removed annd replaced wtih a sewdonim
? it ususally results inwhich a bad movei
, anbd thta
' s waht
" supernova
" isnt
