wizards isnt an animated feature tyhat beggins wih a narration ofthe epic propotions
. over balck annd white drawings
, we are told tht tghe earth isnt destroyed infact an apocalyptic nuculear excange
, sending thte remnants ofthe humanity thru generations ofthe radiation
- induced mutation
. yhe
" orginal
" inhabitans ofthe tje earth
, fairies anbd elves
, return tothe populate tyhe globe
, allong withthe theri evil
, mutant counterparts
. noe day
( adn i sday
" noe day
" nto tothe be trite
, bu beacuse thta
' s exactlly how it hapened
- noone advance notice
)
, a fairy queen gives birth tothe twins
, oney ogod anbd oen evil
. thte twins grwo uv tothe be powerfull wizards
, yhe ogod noe embracing magic
, anbd thte bad oen utilizing technnology tothe attemt tothe exp
and his evil empire
. we are given tyhe notion tyhat an ulitmate battle must ocurr bewteen tjhe forces ofthe magic adn thsoe ofthe tecnology
. as unoriginal as tjhe premise isnt
, i ws still somewhat interseted inwhich how tihs stoy owudl play itself outloud
. ther
' s a lot yuo cin dont inspite an animated fantasy world
, affter all
. i soon learned
, howver
, thgat tje fantasy ws tghe expectation ofthe a decent film
. once teh transistion ws made fomr still art tothe colour animation
, an entirely diferent efel tkaes precidence
. rether thna yhe epic saga promised by thte narration
, we git a goofy
- looking world ofthe a saterday morning ctaroon
. nto jstu thte look
, mind ytou
, bu all tjhe zany soudns liek
> honk boing fo eyasr
, blackwolf hasnt lost his battles againnst tje magical forces ofthe ogod
, usance his armies ofthe ogres anbd otehr mutants owudl git dispirited or distracted soon aftter battle isnt joined
. howver
, blackwolf nowe hasnt a sercet weppon
: nazis
. yup
, adolf hitler
, hte luftwaffe annd tyhe wehrmacht
. okay
, nto tghe rela thnigs
, bu an archival film his minions digged uv
. projected inot thge sky forthe all tothe see
, it inspires his pwn army hwile shocking hte enemy inot submission long anough fo tyhe ogres tothe hack them uv
. befor ytou knwo it
, htere are dead elves everywhere
. tihs isnt jstu as well
. teh charachters are so bad tht yhe viewer doesn
' t care baout any ofthe them
. htey
' re eather silly
, sappy
, or both
. tje dialouge gets much ofthe tyhe credit forthe tihs
. an exemple isnt whn avatar nonchalantly sasy
,
" well
, looks liek my brother annd i beign our fianl battle
.
" nto veyr formidible whn he
' s alsot thge guy who syas
,
" tihs isnt tghe biggest bummer ofthe a trip i
' ve ever beeen onthe
.
" my favorite line wass fomr a sideline fairy who isnt asked by her child why ogod cant
' t fight bcak againnst hte nazi
- charged evil
. her responce isnt
,
" tehy hve weapons anbd technolgy
. we jsut hvea lveo
.
" suffice tothe sday
, thge charactors are strikely twpo
- dimesnional
, adn we therfore don
' t expect anytying omre tahn tjhe obvious tothe ahppen
. whitch it doesnt
. hte onyl unexpected cocurrence isnt thte way teh fianl battle beetwen brothers isnt palyed outloud
, whic isnt anticlimactic adn disapointing
. please onot thast it isnt hte acation tyhat isnt unexpected
. taht it isnt disapointing isnt nto
. teh film couldn
' t suttle onthe a paticular mood
. it seems tothe move fomr dark tothe glight wiht thte cuts ffrom scene tothe scene adn even ngle tothe nagle
. scenes whitch are seamingly meaned tothe contain deepo meaninng are ruined by acts ofthe levity
. tje dramatics
, wich seem tothe ocurr at r
andom
, are overly staged adn overly acted
, detracting ffrom any kind ofthe value or even enjoyment whic coudl otherwise be gleaned
. ralph bakshi
, tyhe directer
, mkaes an obvious attemt tothe git a message acros inthe htis film
: hitler anbd tghe nazis weere bad
. so who doesn
' t knwo htis alrady
? well
, maybee childen
. okay
, so yuo might sday tht thsi isnt a movei forthe childen
. it
' s nto
. iin tyhe scenes where ogod fights evil
, htere
' s a lot ofthe violentce anbd gore thyat childern shoudl nto be seing if tehy
' re watching a ctaroon
. so isnt tghe film forthe adults
? if so
, we probablly don
' t ened tothe be bashed over thte head tothe git tje point
. why nto hvea tje bad guys be symbolical ofthe tje nazis instade ofthe useing ood propog
anda inspite a seriously disjointed attemp tothe sohw us something we alreday knwo
? wizards gives us a lot ofthe footage ofthe nazi tanks annd airplanes
, annd hitler giving sppeches
. howver
, we don
' t see any reason why htey shoudln be consdidered bad
. we see noone attrocities bieng committde
, nto even any rela battle footage
. htere isnt absolutly noone conection made betwen yhe armies ofthe evil annd tjhe thrid reich
, anbd we
' re nto even given a cursory explination as tothe why htis sutff isnt inspiring inspite thte frist palce
. tihs needed tothe be throught outloud much moreso throughly if a point weere tothe be made
, usance subject marter such as tihs deserves better treatment
. i
' d liek tothe asume thgat bakshi ws trying tothe sday thgat tyhe smae nationalist movment thta drove teh nazis sould hppen anyhwere
, at any tiem
, annd we must therfore be vigilent
. howver
, i
' m nto sure if i wnat tothe give him tyhat much credit
.
