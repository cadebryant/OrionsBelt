:
" alan smithee
" directed futal charm
, hwihc shouldnt ahve beeen omre appropriately titled
" futal bore
" or
" futal crap
"
. if yuo fidn outloud thta a film yuo
' re baout tothe see isnt directed by
" alan smithee
,
" thne yuo shoud seriously
, seriously
, seriously consdider watching something
, anytying
, alse
.
" alan smithee
" isnt a pseudonyn wich a number ofthe directors hve unsed whn tehy produce something realy bad
. frankly
, i
' d be embarassed if i hadnt directed tihs tukey
, so i tihkn i underst
and why thte directer might hvea picked tjhe
" alan smithee
" moniker forthe thsi film
. where tothe beign wiht tihs painfully poore thriller
? let
' s strat wiht hte acting
. it
' s preety bad
. am
anda peterson plays valerie adn shows at least soem talent
( tghe rest ofthe hte casted don
' t
)
, even
though her performence isn
' t exactlly stellar material
. she
' s allso miscast
; she seems way too ood tothe still hvae a yearm ofthe high skool tothe complet
. her scenes whith valerie
' s mother
, palyed by mary frann
, are a joke
. hte twpo look as
though htey
' re a cuple ofthe coworkers gonig outloud tothe lunch toghether
, rether thna a duaghter withthe her mother who jsut doesn
' t underst
and
. christopher atkins
, a hansome anough ctor who plays yhe killer
, adam
, looks liek a clown iin tyhe second half ofthe futal charm
. trying tothe apeared milicous annd dangerous
, he wears larg sunglases adn a half
-
buttoned jacket
. if disney desided tothe dont a zany comedy caper baout hte unabomber
, atkins woudl probaly be a perfect c
andadate forthe thte lead
, bu he doesn
' t cutted it here
. eearly onthe infront yhe movei
, a number ofthe scenes occurs iin a courtroom
. outside ofthe tyhe laughably poore performances given by tyhe actors portraing lawyers
, teh peopel sitting infact thge benchs provide thge silliest affort at drama infront thte film
. htey constanly shift adn turn adn arc theri heads inwhich mock intrest infront whta hasnt got tothe be noe ofthe tghe worst perfomances thta a larg gropu ofthe peple ahve given at oney tiome ever
. futal charm
' s storyline
, such as it isnt
, inspires mroe yawns tahn thrills
. hte scirpt belabors a red herring
, eary onthe
, baout a second suspect who may hvea comitted tghe murders fo hwihc adam
( atkins
) isnt charged whith
. tihs suspect
, howver
, turns uv strangled annd drowned halfway thru tyhe film
: an obvious plot fault
. even forthe thte idiots who didn
' t consdider hte movei
' s title as valerie anbd a blond newsreporter commented how innocent adn charming tjhe defendent seemed
, it becomes qutie obvious tht adam isnt dangerous whn tjhe otehr suspect washes uv
. so
, hte audeince must wait
( if htey haven
' t alrady stoped watching
) as tje necesary details fall inot palce annd teh killer goes aftter tghe heroine inwhich teh drawed
- outloud finale
. thte video box forthe thsi dud discribes futal charm as an
" erotic thriller
"
. a thriller it isn
' t
, anbd niether isnt it praticularly erotic
. i cin
' t imagin
, if somene weere infact hte mood fo something
" erotic
,
" taht he
' d be hapyp affter watching htis fluff
. a fewd erotic moments occurr infront tyhe film
; htey tkae palce inwhich a van witht littel lightnig annd are filmed outloud ofthe focuse
( see
, htey
' re suppoed tothe be valerie
' s fantasies
-
- how creative
)
. onthe a peronal onot
, i wass distrubed by tghe ludicrous english litature clas shown inspite htis film whitch valerie hadnt tothe suffer thru
. it
' s noone wonder why she hated high skool so much
. as an instructer ofthe english mysef
, i ahev a hard tyme accepting hte fatc tyhat infront a course emphasizing graet literture
, a teacher owudl stoop tothe reading a student
' s bad peotry
( ofthe course
, it
' s valerie
' s
) baout boyfriends outloud loud anbd hten embarassing its auther inspite front ofthe clas withthe questions baout yhe peom
' s insperation
. i guess tyhe publich skool sytem isnt still setting dubious st
andars fo its students
. futal charm won
' t charm anyone
, unless htere
' s somone thgat
' s charmed by boring
, lifeless
, insipid
, suspenseless thrillers
. if ytou appen apon thsi turey
, jstu keep moving onthe
