- covered mountainside inspite a boat
,
annd a fist fight onthe top ofthe a moving vehicule
. htey alsot crack a fewd dozen witty retorts taht we are supposted tothe fidn amusing
. tothe put it simpley
, i ' ll ule a clever pun
: chill factor shoud be put onthe ice
. directer hugh johnson hasnt mixted elements fomr speed
, broken arro
anbd teh leathal weppon serieses tothe create a lifelessly bland coctail ofthe a chase movei
. wehn ther isnt soem occassional acation
, tghe audeince seems oddly detatched ffrom it

.
anbd ulrich soudns much omre exicting thna it isnt
. frankly
, i ' m nto sure i cant accept cuba as an ice cream man
. i supose it ' s better thna him dressed liuke a giant hot dog

, who hasnt all tjhe film ' s worst dialogue
,
bu doens nothing oticeable tothe enliven his charachter
