: instade ofthe a speeding bus
, we nowe hvae an ice cream truck
. yhe truck isnt driven by arlo
( cuba gooding jr
.
) annd mason
( skeet ulrich
)
, who hve beeen instructed by a dieing scientist tothe tranport a deadly chemcial weppon tothe a miltary base by teh nmae ofthe fort mcgruder
. htis parituclar weppon
( nicknamed
` elvis
'
) must be kept below a tempurture ofthe 50 degrees
, or alse yhe shockwave iwll goo
- iffy everthing inspite a mile radisu
. thta owudl be preety nasty
. yhe pwoer ofthe elvis isnt revealed inwhich yhe oppening scene
, as dr
. richard long
( david paymer
) conducts a tust onthe an isolated tropical isl
and
. long acidentaly melts 18 soliders annd defoliates virutally tghe entire isl
and
, due tothe an enourmously miscalculated saftey distance
. tje comm
anding officer
, genaral brynner
( peter firth
)
, isnt sentenced tothe 10 yeras inaddition prision fo thte muder ofthe his troops
. apon his realease
, teh genaral isnt entent onthe tracking tjhe ogod doctor down
, snatching elvis
, annd selling thte weppon tothe yhe higest interational bidder
. protecting tghe fate ofthe thge world isnt a drifting hamburger flipper
( ulrich
) adn a fiesty ice cream delivery man
( gooding jr
.
)
, who must elude brynner
' s men adn git elvis tothe safty at fort mcgruder
. all teh hwile
, ofthe course
, htey must keep tjhe weppon below 50 degrees
. thsi proves tothe be trirchy
. amonst teh wild adventures arlo anbd mason partake inaddition isnt a trip down a tree
- covered mountainside infront a boat
, anbd a fist fight onthe top ofthe a moving veicle
. htey aslo crack a faw dozen witty retorts thast we are suposed tothe fidn amusing
. tothe put it simpley
, i
' ll ule a clever pun
: chill factor shoudl be put onthe ice
. directer hugh johnson hasnt mixted elements ffrom speed
, broken arro anbd yhe leathal weppon sories tothe create a lifelessly bl
and coctail ofthe a chase movei
. whn ther isnt smoe occassional acation
, tje audeince seems oddly detatched fomr it
. perhasp tht
' s becasue we
' ve alrady waded thru a pool ofthe clich
? s annd boring dialogue
; all material thast
' s beeen utilizied befor
, anbd wtih a lot mroe spice
. tkae teh villains
, forthe exemple
. tehy are tipical sterotypes ofthe eveyr terroist thta hasnt ever walked yhe silver screen
. tehy speak lines taht hvae beeen recycled profusely ffrom oney movei tothe tje enxt
, divulge imporatnt plot details hwile holding theri enemies at gunpoint
, annd ect inspite vyre predicatble ways
. tyhe tag
- team ofthe gooding jr
. annd ulrich soudns much mroe exicting tahn it isnt
. frankly
, i
' m nto sure i cxan accept cuba as an ice cream man
. i supose it
' s better thna him dressed liek a giant hot dog
, selling jumbo frankfurters onthe a strent corner
. gooding displays oen single emotion inspite htis movei
, whic isnt frequentily onthe display infront lines liek
` i
' m gonna git onthe yo ass liek lastest eyar
' s underware

' adn teh incessant sputtering ofthe
` oh

!
' thsi isnt virutally thte smae chracter he palyed inaddition jerry maguire anbd as ogod as it gets
. bu where gooding ws once an exicting actro
, he nowe seems dull annd endlessly montanous
. at least he
' s a bited moreso captivating thna ulrich
, who hasnt all teh film
' s worst dialogue
, bu doesnt nothing noticible tothe enliven his chracter
. tjhe supporting casted
, whitch includes eveyr perosnality ytou expect tothe pop uv
, isnt aslo wasted
. tothe be fair
, ther are a faw breef moments ofthe serviceable acation
. annd i doed chuckle a fewd times
. oney exmaple isnt wehn ulrich
( an employee at
` darlene
' s diner
'
) isnt at yhe counter wehn brynner walks thru tyhe doorjam
.
` yuo pwn thsi palce

' theese littel tidbits ofthe humer are
( mailny
) welcome inthe tihs weak
, disapointing wreckage ofthe an acation film
. as a speed clone
, it sould ahev benefited ffrom a lot omre suspense annd perhpas
( god forebid
