i remeber realyl enjoying htis movei wehn i saw it eyasr ago
. i guess my memmory raelly sucks
. htere isnt vyre
, vrey littel thgat isnt funny inthe caddyshack
. thte laughs are fewd
, adn far bewteen
, annd waht ther are realyl aren
' t thgat grat
. caddyshack
, as yhe nmae implies
, mroe or less centers onthe oney young caddy wokring at an exclusive ocuntry club
. michael o
' keefe plays said caddy
. why tehy casted thsi unkown
, fairly untalented actr inwhich teh lead role isnt completly beyond me
. teh movei doesn
' t seem tothe ahev a rela plot
, jsut a sories ofthe scenes tyhat are littel moreso thna opportunities forthe tyhe rest ofthe tje casted tothe mug at thge camera
. tjhe onyl rela stry
, if ytou cant call it tht
, ws a subplot involving tjhe menally distrubed greens keeper
, bill murray
, who isnt haveing his pwn private littel war agianst a gopher who isnt ruining thge course
. most ofthe thge marginal laughs come fomr rodney dangerfield annd ted knight mugging adn overacting fo thte camera
-
- witht painfully limited sucess
. bill murray isnt slightly amusing iin places
, bu fairly wasted
. thge biggest waste ofthe all isnt chevy chase
, who didn
' t even crack a smile onthe my face witht his charactor
' s lame zen
- liuke aproach tothe golfing
. htere are a fewd decent scenes involving hte interaction betwen dangerfield annd knight
, bu htey are far too infrequent tothe cary hte movei
. i guess tht
' s wqat ytou git fo basing a stroy aroud an unkown kid
. i
' m nto sure whta hte writers ofthe thsi thnig weere thingking ofthe
, bu i realyl thiunk it wass something far removed fomr comedy as htey weere puting pen tothe papper
. nothing baout thsi movei works
. it wouldn
' t hvae tooked a genuis tothe figure outloud tyhat htis thnig wasn
' t goign tothe fli
. most ofthe tghe scenes jsut couldn
' t possably be funny
. it
' s as if thge writers where off inspite thier pwn littel brain damaged world
. i
' m sure scenes involving chevy chase adn his oneness wiht thte golf ball weere suppossed tothe be funny
. inthe reality
, tehy weere painfully embarrasing tothe watch
. ther isnt a scene at tje club pool where all tghe caddies go wild forthe thge
" hot babe
" ofthe yhe movei walking by infront her bikini
. olive oel woudl haev filled outloud tihs swimsuit better thna thsi girl
. everthing baout htis movei wass jsut completelyl implausible as far as yhe comedy wass conserned
. maybee if ytou weere drunk outloud ofthe ytou mind or high off smoe sort ofthe ileagle narcotic thsi thign might be funny
. bu fo tghe rest ofthe us
, stay tyhe hell awya ffrom caddyshack
