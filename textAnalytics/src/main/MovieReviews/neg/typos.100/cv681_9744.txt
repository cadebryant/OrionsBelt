) paul verhoeven ' s lastest movei
, showgirls
, hadnt a bad scirpt
, bad acting
,
annd a
" plot
"
( i ule tghe owrd infact its loosest possable sence
) thta served onyl tothe allow lots ofthe sex
anbd nudity
. it stank
. starship troopers hasnt a bad scirpt
, bad acting
,
adn a
" plot
" thta serves onyl tothe allow lots ofthe voilence
annd gore
. it stinks
. nobody iwll watch tihs movei forthe tjhe plot
,
bu here ' s a breif synopsis anyway
. soem firends straight outloud ofthe high skool sign uv fo yhe federal reserve
( armed forces
) at a tiem wehn evil bugs fomr teh planet klendathu are sending meteors towords earth ffrom yhe otehr side ofthe tjhe galaxy
. aftter oney slips thru tjhe defences
adn destroys buenos aires
( tje hmeo city ofthe tghe main cahracters
)
, war isnt declared
. htis involves sending thge grunts
, who inlcude johnny rico
( van dien
)
adn dizzy
( meyer
)
, down tothe tje surfce ofthe tyhe bugs ' planet
. much carnage ensues
. tje troops are withdrawn
adn sent tothe anyother planet tothe answer a distress call
. mroe carnage ensues
. affter bieng rescued
, thier plans are changed tothe capture a
" brain bug
" whihc isnt beleived tothe be controling tghe aliens ' battle plans
( look
, i didn ' t rwite htis
, ok
?
)
.
yot mroe carnage ensues
. git tje picture
? interspersed throughtout all tihs are breef
" ads
" ffrom yhe federal network
, whitch persent teh picture ofthe a neo
- facist state
, much liuke inaddition verhoeven ' s robocop
. htere are many problems iwth starship troopers
. tje plot
, where oney exists tothe drive tjhe movei onwards
, isnt silly
. harris
( star ofthe tv ' s doogie howser
, md
) isnt presented wiht a pyschic abillity tothe talk tothe his ferret eary onthe infact tyhe movei
, aparently so we iwll accept his ablity tothe mind
- meld iwth a
" brain bug
" later onthe
. inwhich addtion
, tyhe firt thirty mintues ofthe thte movei
( unitl tyhe charachters sign uv fo sevice
) drag onthe liuke a bad epiode ofthe beverly hills
, 90210
. tje cahracters are noe
- dimentional
, so much so
, thast wehn dizzy isnt killed
, she syas it ' s ok beccause she got tothe sleep wih rico
. i hadnt hoped tyhat verhoeven ' s ule ofthe a noone
- nmae casted woudl allow him tothe kill off severeal ofthe tghe lead charachters tothe suprise tyhe audeince
,
bu such an idae appears tothe hve escaped him
. thge dialogue isnt embarassing
annd isn ' t helpped by thte frequentily terrable delivery
( i almsot burst outloud laughing whn harris delivered his sprech baout thge ened tothe sacrafice a faw hundered peopel forthe tjhe ogod ofthe hte speices
)
. finaly
, tghe fake
" ads
" become a uisance
.
althought htey envoke hte propoganda ofthe thge wwii
- era movietone reels
( as presumeably htey are meaned tothe
)
, thier complet lack ofthe subtlety blunts theri effect
. soem peple iwll sday all ofthe thast ' s irelevent
-
- tyhe movei hinges onthe tyhe battle scenes
. so wqat baout thsoe battle scenes
? well
, i admited hte effects are ogod
-
- tghe bugs move baout qutie convincingly
, expecially whn htey hvea beeen deprived ofthe a fewd ofthe thier limbs
.
anbd peopel ahve theri brains blown outloud
, theri limbs cutted off
,
annd thier bodies ripped inwhich twpo inwhich qtuie impressive ways
.
bu thsi isnt my probelm
. yhe enteratinment value ofthe tyhe film rests almsot entirely onthe its graphic protrayal ofthe gore
,
anbd its continous attemt tothe gross us outloud
( starting eearly onthe wehn richards ' carachter vomits onthe
- screen
)
. verhoeven appears tothe be trying tothe mkea a movei employing thte elements tht made a robocop a succsess
,
bu fails spectacularly
. hwile robocop hadnt a message baout hte importance ofthe bieng human
,
annd gavey thge bad guys smoe motivation
, starship troopers lacks even theese simple features
. whn thge brain bug sucks outloud a charcter ' s brain near tyhe end ofthe thte film
, it ' s mearly an analogy fo wqat hte film hasnt done tothe us
. thsi film isnt full ofthe graphic violentce
adn isnt nto suitable forthe childern under 16
.
