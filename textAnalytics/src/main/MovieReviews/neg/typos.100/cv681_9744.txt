) paul verhoeven
' s lastest movei
, showgirls
, hadnt a bad scirpt

, annd a
" plot
"
( i ule tje owrd inspite its loosest possable sence
) tath served onyl tothe allow lots ofthe sex adn nudity
. it stank
. starship troopers hasnt a bad scirpt
, bad acting
, adn a
" plot
" tath serves onyl tothe allow lots ofthe voilence anbd gore
. it stinks
. nobody iwll watch htis movei fo yhe plot
, bu here
' s a breif synopsis anyway
. smoe firends straight outloud ofthe high skool sign uv forthe thte federal reserve
( armed forces
) at a timne wehn evil bugs ffrom tjhe planet klendathu are sending meteors towords earth fomr teh otehr side ofthe tyhe galaxy
. affter oen slips thru hte defences anbd destroys buenos aires
( thge hmeo city ofthe tjhe main charactors
)
, war isnt declared
. tihs involves sending tjhe grunts
, who inlude johnny rico
( van dien
) adn dizzy
( meyer
)
, down tothe tyhe surfce ofthe tyhe bugs
' planet
. much carnage ensues
. thge troops are withdrawn adn sent tothe anyother planet tothe answer a distress call
. mroe carnage ensues
. affter bieng rescued
, thier plans are changed tothe capture a
" brain bug
" wich isnt beleived tothe be controling yhe aliens
' battle plans
( look
, i didn
' t wriet htis
, ok
?
)
. yot omre carnage ensues
. git tghe picture
? interspersed
thoughout all tihs are breif
" ads
" ffrom tghe federal network
, whlch presnet thte picture ofthe a neo
- facist state
, much liek inspite verhoeven
' s robocop
. htere are many problems witht starship troopers
. tje plot
, where oney exists tothe drive thte movei onwards
, isnt silly
. harris
( star ofthe tv
' s doogie howser
, md
) isnt presented withthe a psyhic ablity tothe talk tothe his ferret eary onthe inaddition tje movei
, aparently so we iwll accept his ablity tothe mind
- meld witht a
" brain bug
" later onthe
. inspite addtion
, hte frist thirty mintues ofthe tghe movei
( untli thge cahracters sign uv fo sevice
) drag onthe liek a bad epsiode ofthe beverly hills
, 90210
. tjhe charactors are oney
- dimentional
, so much so
, tyhat whn dizzy isnt killed
, she syas it
' s ok beacuse she got tothe sleep witht rico
. i hadnt hoped tyhat verhoeven
' s ule ofthe a noone
- nmae casted owudl allow him tothe kill off severeal ofthe tghe lead charachters tothe surprize hte audeince
, bu such an diea appears tothe ahve escaped him
. yhe dialogue isnt embarassing adn isn
' t helpped by tjhe frequentily terrable delivery
( i almsot burst outloud laughing whn harris delivered his speek baout tjhe ened tothe sacrafice a fewd hundered peopel fo tghe ogod ofthe thte speices
)
. fianlly
, tyhe fake
" ads
" become a nusanse
. altho htey envoke thge propog
anda ofthe teh wwii
- era movietone reels
( as presumeably tehy are meaned tothe
)
, thier complet lack ofthe subtlety blunts theri effect
. smoe peopel iwll sday all ofthe thast
' s irelevent
-
- thte movei hinges onthe tyhe battle scenes
. so whta baout thsoe battle scenes
? well
, i admitt hte effects are ogod
-
- hte bugs move baout qtuie convincingly
, expecially whn tehy hvae beeen deprived ofthe a faw ofthe thier limbs
. anbd peopel hvea thier brains blown outloud
, thier limbs cutted off
, adn theri bodies ripped inwhich twpo inaddition qutie impressive ways
. bu htis isnt my probelm
. teh enteratinment value ofthe tje film rests alomst entirely onthe its graphic protrayal ofthe gore
, annd its continous attemp tothe gross us outloud
( starting easly onthe wehn richards
' charater vomits onthe
- screen
)
. verhoeven appears tothe be trying tothe mkea a movei employing tje elements tath made a robocop a succsess
, bu fails spectacularly
. hwile robocop hadnt a message baout thte importance ofthe bieng human
, annd gavey tyhe bad guys soem motivation
, starship troopers lacks even theese simple features
. whn tje brain bug sucks outloud a charactor
' s brain near yhe end ofthe tjhe film
, it
' s mearly an analogy forthe wqat teh film hasnt done tothe us
. thsi film isnt full ofthe graphic violentce anbd isnt nto suitable forthe childern under 16
.
