: it
' s nto so much tath tihs isnt a bad movei
, tahn thte fatc thta it sucks
. htis movei isnt chock
- full ofthe oen
- dimentional charactors
, countains noone actuall humer tyhat i ws able tothe zone inaddition onthe
, zero tension or thrills
, plot holes thte size ofthe my big ass
, lame pop tunes plyed tothe mask nothing oging onthe iin thge movei
, adn molly ringwald
, vivica a
. fox annd lesley anne warren tossed awya inwhich throwaway roles
. i ws primed fo thsi film as its intresting premise hadnt me thingking misery

) annd 9 tothe 5
, bu unfortunatly forthe williamson
, he whent nowhere wiht tjhe bright foundation
, mkaing refrences tothe teh exorcist adn dr
. zhivago
, whlch i dout many infront his target market iwll apprieciate
. he alsot forgot baout suspense
, whith all ofthe his cahracters based onthe incomprehensible descisions
, unbeleivable motivations annd simpley boring us withthe all ofthe thier trite dialogue
. sure
, katie holmes isnt cute
, adn her co
- star
, marisa coughlan
, doed a reasonably amusing impression ofthe tyhe exorcist
( worth twpo points outloud ofthe my threee onthe ten
)
, bu how cin we foregive tyhe biggest oen
- dimentional charachter infront any film
, holmes
' rival inwhich thge film
, mrs
. tingle
' s complet unprofessionalism bieng let go by all others arund her
( are teachers alloween tothe behave tyhat way nowdays
?
) adn a transparent romance bewteen holmes anbd soem long
- haired dued
, hired tothe be thte poore man
' s verzion ofthe skeet ulrich
( who hismelf isnt a poore man
' s verzion ofthe johnny depp
!
)
. all inthe all
, htis movei ws laughable forthe me
, provded me wih noone insight inot anytying
, demonstrated williamson
' s genuin lack ofthe directorial skills alongside a juvenile scirpt
, annd provded helen mirren witht a grat role tothe chew inot
, unfortunatly forgetting tothe give her charactor any believability
, humanity or capacity tothe comprehend
. noone hip lines
, noone cheap thrills
, jsut a dull tyme at hte movei theather
. if ytou watn tothe see a funny teenage movei
, go see detriot rock city
