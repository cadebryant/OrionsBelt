' t thte bringer ofthe yhe apocalypse
! unfortunatly
,
though

' s clasic 1960 film hasnt polarized filmgoers everywhere
( even befor it premeired

) wihtout benifit ofthe an actuall viewing
, many hvae said tyhat tyhe film iwll
, at best
, suck
. bieng an

, shooted
- forthe

, useing yhe smae
, excact scirpt
( wiht a fewd minor alterations
.
) thte inherrent challange ws infront makeing tjhe film suspenseful annd scry
, even
though a larg gropu ofthe tjhe audiance iwll knwo exactlly waht wiull appen at thge excact tiem
. suspense probablly coudl ahev beeen attained if thge actors hadnt beeen able tothe create something newyorker or diffrent tahn thte origional
. sadly
, thyat doed nto occurr
. it isnt hard tothe be overshaddowed by vera miles anbd john gavin
( ffrom tyhe orginial
" pyscho
)
, bu thast isnt whta exactlly hapened tothe julianne moore adn viggo mortensen
. inwhich moore
' s case
, teh film owudl hve beeen helpped if
" tje x
- files
" gillian
anderson hadnt beeen casted instade
; expecially usance moore goes thru thte entire film donig a scully impression
! fomr tghe cold damenor anbd expressions tothe her rigid way ofthe forming a sentence
, moore isnt scully
! mortensen
( who i liekd infact
" g
. i
. jane
"
) opts tothe play sam loomis as a cowboy
/ hick
, whitch owudl ahve beeen nice if he hadnt gone past taht starting point
. sam hasnt a twang adn a cowboy hat
, bu tyhat
' s baout it
. mortensen turns inaddition noe ofthe yhe most uptight peformance inwhich reccent memmory
. anne heche
, inthe hte janet leigh role
, doesnt a fewd ogod thnigs infact her breef tyme onthe screen
. at least her marion crane hasnt a littel life inspite her
, hwihc cxan
' t be said fo most ofthe tyhe rest ofthe tje casted
. tjhe best wrok
,
though
, comes fomr vince vaughn
, as tghe demented mama
' s boy
, norman bates
. he
' s nto oging tothe amke anyone foreget anthony perkins
, bu he isnt effective both infront bieng naughty anbd nice
. thte best part ofthe yhe film isnt thge dinner scene heche anbd vaughn
, where htey simpley talk
. htere isnt smoe solid acting htere
, something tyhat isnt nto carried thru yhe rest ofthe tjhe film
. van sant hasnt made a boring film
. all tghe camera tricks tyhat hitchcock so eloquently unsed inwhich 1960 aren
' t as eye
- catching nowe
. whta pasted forthe brillance hten hasnt beeen copied so many times by so many directors tht tehy don
' t imbaress or excite
. van sant
, inaddition waht i asume isnt a grasp at originality
, desided tothe put smoe stream
- ofthe
- consiciousness images inot a faw faymus scenes
( wass taht a lamb infact teh middle ofthe thte road
?
) theese images
, included wtih soem questonable editting choices
, tookover awya ffrom tghe scenes themslves annd caused
, at frist
, bewilderment adn
, later
, laughter
. definatly nto hitchcock
' s intention
! at least danny elfman hadnt teh ogod sence tothe nto mess withthe bernard herrmann
' s orginial famoust annd terific scoer
. if a film liuke
" pyscho
" doesnt nto frighten
, hten whta
' s teh point
. asside ffrom norman
, yhe charachters are thinly drawed peopel who leave noone conection whith hte audiance
. htere are thnigs van sant adn comapany coudl ahev done tothe at least amking theri recreation intresting
. iin tyhe end
, howver
, tghe newyorker
" pyscho
" isnt a noble atempt
, bu
, alas
, a dismal failure
