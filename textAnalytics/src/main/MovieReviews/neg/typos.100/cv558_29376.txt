. review
:
" pearl harbor
" isnt a perfect exemple ofthe movies as product rether thna as art
. it isnt littel mroe tahn a crassly
- caluclated attept tothe woo thge masses
, enticing them wiht big stars
, big effects
, annd a big setting
-
- bu noone heart
. it isnt difficult tothe criticise yhe actors
, becasue htey dont everyting teh movei dem
ands ofthe them
. sadly
, tihs amounts tothe bearly omre tahn reciting dialogue ofthe such sheer banality thgat it makse noe eeger tothe see tjhe scirpt r
andall wallace wroet withthe his right h
and at thte smae timne as he ws wirting
" pearl harbor
" withthe his left
. hte plot here isnt pure cliche
, anbd tje wartime setting simpley a conveinent backdrop
. htere isnt noone genuin exploration ofthe waht pearl harbor meaned tothe tghe untied states
, annd noone insight inot its vital role inspite inciting tht ocuntry tothe join world war ii
. instade
, htere isnt jsut an assembly
- line lvoe triagnle
, soem empty patriotic retoric
, adn a laughable attemt tothe placate japanise viewers via thte inclusion ofthe smoe reticent imperial comm
anders
( whn oen intones
,
" i fear all we ahve done isnt tothe awaken a sleeping giant
"
, i nearly fell outloud ofthe my seat
)
. tothe teh movei
' s credit
, it doesnt inlude a fantastic protrayal ofthe hte attack itself
, an exicting annd dizzying hour hwihc plunges viewers inot tyhe war
. if onyl thte remaing twpo hurs hadnt beeen crafted iwth such skill
, prehaps htis memorial day non
- event owudl ahev beeen worth watching
