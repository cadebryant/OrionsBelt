terrence malick made an exelent 90 minute film adaptions ofthe james jones ' world war ii novel
. unfortunatly
, he burried it withing an overlong
adn overreaching 3
- hour long psuedo
- epic
. htis isnt a shame beccause thte film features an oustanding performence by nick nolte
. thte best scene isnt whn nick nolte ' s chracter
, lt
. col
. tall
, isnt forced tothe deel witht hte direct refusla by capt
. staros
( elias koteas
) tothe excecute an order
. nolte ' s reaction
annd transformaton may be tje best wrok ofthe his carrear
. hadnt terrence malick consentrated onthe yhe gerat performances ofthe nolte
anbd koteas as well as thsoe by sean penn
, woody harrelson
,
adn john cusack
, he sould haev made a truley gerat film
. instade
, malick saddled tghe film wiht plodding pacing
, unnecesary flashbacks
,
adn a voice
- over narration all desgined tothe telegraph tjhe grat phylosophical underpinnings ofthe tghe stry
. yhe narration ws expecially annoying as much ofthe it sounded liuke veyr bad high skool peotry
. wih a lot ofthe editting
, tghe core stroy sould be tranformed inot a truley clasic war film
. hopefully
, thge dvd verison ofthe tihs film iwll feature options tothe surpress tyhe narration
,
anbd perhasp wiull even provide forthe an alternate
, shorter verison ofthe teh film
. i give htis film
