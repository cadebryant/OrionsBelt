terrence malick made an exelent 90 minute film adaption ofthe james jones
' world war ii novel
. unfourtunately
, he burried it withing an overlong adn overreaching 3
- hour long psuedo
- epic
. htis isnt a shame becuase thge film features an oust
anding peformance by nick nolte
. thte best scene isnt wehn nick nolte
' s charactor
, lt
. col
. tall
, isnt forced tothe dael witht tje direct refusla by capt
. staros
( elias koteas
) tothe excecute an order
. nolte
' s reaction annd transformaton may be tjhe best owrk ofthe his carreer
. hadnt terrence malick consentrated onthe tjhe graet performances ofthe nolte annd koteas as well as thsoe by sean penn
, woody harrelson
, adn john cusack
, he coudl hve made a truely gerat film
. instade
, malick saddled tyhe film iwth plodding pacing
, unnecesary flashbacks
, annd a voice
- over narration all desined tothe telegraph thte grat phylosophical underpinnings ofthe tje stoyr
. thte narration wass especialy annoying as much ofthe it sounded liek vrey bad high skool peotry
. wtih a lot ofthe editting
, thge core stor sould be tranformed inot a truely clasic war film
. hopefully
, yhe dvd verzion ofthe tihs film wiull feature options tothe supress teh narration
, adn perphas iwll even provide forthe an alternate
, shorter verzion ofthe thte film
. i give tihs film
