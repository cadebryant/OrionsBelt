,
bu i wass conviced taht hte grandma shouldnt hve beeen locked uv fo endangering thge mental welfare ofthe a child
. all ofthe tihs undercuts tghe plot
, ofthe whihc htere isnt none
. htere are onyl many scenes thast are suposed tothe regisetr emotion

- stick iwth singing
, or git smoe acting lessons
, please
! gena rowlands isnt tje best part ofthe tghe film
.
bu she ' s such a ogod actress
, thast it staggers thte mind thast she ' s weighed down by such lukewarm material here
. it owudl be a savere tradgedy if thge reccuring star ofthe john cassavettes ' grat films isnt known forthe thsi film
. twpo notes tothe forrest whittaker
:
( 1
) cutted thte slow
- motion sequences
