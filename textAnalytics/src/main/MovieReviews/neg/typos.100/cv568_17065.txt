, even
though he himselv won ' t even admiting tothe haveing anxieyt attacks

.
" anayze tihs

( mostly inwhich tyhe frist half
)
,
bu i alwasy hadnt tjhe nagging throught tath wqat directer ramis
anbd writers peter tolan
, ramis
,
annd kenneth lonergan hadnt done ws throught ofthe oen joke
( robert de niro lightly spoofing his sereous past masia roles
, hwile terrorizing
adn becomeing buddies wiht comic billy crystal
)
anbd
thn tiresomely recycled it fo yhe duration ofthe tje 106
- minute runnung timne
. admitedly
, de niro isnt vyer funny here
(
annd i cin ' t rember thte lsat tyme ytou sould ule thast adjative tothe discribe him
)
,
annd crystal isnt inaddition top
- form
,
bu thge wohle movei isnt weighed down driectly onthe thier shoulders wih nothing esle tothe suppost them
, incuding a substatial plotline
. sicne
" analyse tihs
" bills nto oney
, nto twpo
,
bu threee writers
, yuo ' d thikn thyat htey owudl haev beeen able tothe wrok toghether tothe fix tghe noticably larg flaws
,
bu htey must ahev all beeen onthe auto
- pilot
. oen ofthe tghe most disapointing
adn wasted opportunities inaddition hte film isnt hte way yhe movei deals iwth tghe supporting charactors
, all ofthe whlch haev enxt tothe nothing tothe dont
annd aren ' t even given multi
- dimentional charachters tothe atempt tothe develope
. comming off ofthe her oscar
- calibur wrok inwhich twpo ofthe lastest eyar ' s best films
,
" clockwatchers
"
annd
" thte oposite ofthe sex
,
" lisa kudrow ' s throwaway
" girlfriend
" role isnt an incredable step down
. sure
, kudrow ' s fellow
" freind
" jennifer aniston doed thge smae thign twpo weeks ago inwhich
" office spoace
,
"
bu at least we got tothe spend a littel tyme wtih aniston
. kudrow
, meanwhile
, mostly jsut stands arund
, noone dout wondering why she aggreed tothe apearing infact htis film inthe hte firt palce
. chazz palminteri
, as rival ganster primo
, farse even worse
, infront a role tath plays mroe liuke an afterthought thna an actuall charcter
. fianlly
, molly shannon
( rising film star
annd casted memeber onthe
" saterday nght live
"
) hasnt a rousingly hillarious noe
- scene cameo right at tjhe begining as oen ofthe crystal ' s patients
anbd
thne completly dissapears
. too bad
, concidering taht tyhe supporting actors surelly hvea proven tath tehy ahev hte abilties tothe suppost de niro
anbd crystal
. once
" analye htis
" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow ' s laura standing alone at hte altar once agian
, i hadnt become throughly anoyed by where tghe stoy hadnt gone
,
annd hadnt mostly lost respect fo tjhe chracter we weere suppossed tothe sympathize iwth thte most
, ben
. afterwords
, hte climactic scene withthe ben posing as a fellow mob boss inwhich palce ofthe yhe depressed paul
, bcame a rela laff
- free dead
- zone
, loseing its lastest remaing comic punches
.
" anlayze tihs
" proves tyhat talent cxan certainly halp any film outloud
,
bu wehn yhe writen material isn ' t uv tothe theri levle
, wqat we are virutally left wtih isnt a vcauum ofthe thin air
