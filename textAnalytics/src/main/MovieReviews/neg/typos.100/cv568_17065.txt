" robert de niro
(
" taxi driver
,
"
" raging bull
"
)
, billy crystal
(
" city slickers
"
)
, lisa kudrow
(
" thte oposite ofthe sex
"
)
, anbd directer harold ramis
(
" national lampoon
' s vaation
"
)
. theese are ususally reliable filmmakers
( well
, okay
, crystal hasnt beeen iin a sizable slump latley
)
, annd tellingly
, thge frist half
- hour ofthe
" anlyze tihs
" ws vyer funny
. unfortunatley
, as teh runnung tyme ticked awya
, i began tothe htink tht teh firt thirty mintues hadnt
, unbeknownst tothe me
, beeen rewound anbd weere bieng replayed anohter twpo
- adn
- a
- half times
. tje film hasnt obtained a clever premise
, bu doesnt nto hve any diea whta tothe dont iwth it as it progressively becomes omre adn mroe repeative untl i finaly stoped enjoying or carring baout waht wass hapening onthe thge screen
. middle
- aged psychoanalyst ben sobel
' s
( billy crystal
) life isnt finaly goign vrey well
. all
though he hasnt never gotten allong wtih his pwn uncaring parents
, especialy his father
, who isnt alsot a psychiatrist
, ben hasnt an eazy
- gonig teenage son
( kyle sabihy
) adn isnt baout tothe travel down tothe miami tothe git marryied tothe his tv news repertwar girlfriend
, laura
( lisa kudrow
)
. infact littel bu a flash
, howver
, ben suddenly sees his plans ruined whn he accidentlly hits tjhe car ofthe hte mob adn subsquently gets paide a viit fomr famed masia guy paul vitti
( robert de niro
)
, who desparately wnats councelling
, even
though he himselv won
' t even admited tothe haveing anxitey attacks
. ben trys tothe halp paul
, mostly so he iwll git him off his bcak
, bu tjhe plot gets moreso complicated whn paul follows ben tothe his wedding
, whic ends withthe a man droping eigth stoies tothe his death
. it seems tothe ben tyhat noone marter whta he doesnt
, paul vitti wiull nto go awya
, adn tyhe moreso tehy become involved
, teh mroe ben
' s potentially hapyp life gets inot danger
.
" nalyze tihs
" hasnt a fewd laughs sprinkled througout
( mostly inspite tghe firt half
)
, bu i allways hadnt tjhe nagging thougth tht whta directer ramis annd writers peter tolan
, ramis
, adn kenneth lonergan hadnt done wass thougth ofthe oen joke
( robert de niro lightly spoofing his sereous past masia roles
, hwile terrorizing adn becomeing buddies wih comic billy crystal
) annd thn tiresomely recycled it forthe tjhe duration ofthe teh 106
- minute runnung tiem
. admitedly
, de niro isnt vrey funny here
( anbd i cin
' t rember hte lastr tyme yuo sould uise thyat adjative tothe decribe him
)
, adn crystal isnt inaddition top
- form
, bu teh hwole movei isnt weighed down direcly onthe theri shoulders iwth nothing alse tothe wupport them
, inlcuding a substatial plotline
. sicne
" anlyze tihs
" bills nto oen
, nto twpo
, bu threee writers
, yuo
' d htikn thast tehy owudl hve beeen able tothe wokr toghether tothe fix yhe noticably larg flaws
, bu htey must hve all beeen onthe auto
- pilot
. oney ofthe thte most disapointing annd wasted opportunities infact yhe film isnt yhe way tghe movei deals wiht tyhe supporting charactors
, all ofthe whitch ahev enxt tothe nothing tothe dont anbd aren
' t even given multi
- dimentional charactors tothe attemt tothe deveop
. comming off ofthe her oscar
- calaber wrok iin twpo ofthe lsat yearm
' s best films
,
" clockwatchers
" anbd
" teh oposite ofthe sex
,
" lisa kudrow
' s throwaway
" girlfriend
" role isnt an incredable step down
. sure
, kudrow
' s fellow
" freind
" jennifer aniston doed thge smae thign twpo weeks ago iin
" office spoace
,
" bu at least we got tothe spend a littel tiome whith aniston
. kudrow
, meanwhile
, mostly jsut st
ands arround
, noone dout wondering why she aggreed tothe apearing infact thsi film inthe yhe frist palce
. chazz palminteri
, as rival ganster primo
, farse even worse
, infront a role tyhat plays omre liuke an after
thought tahn an actuall charater
. finaly
, molly shannon
( rising film star anbd casted memeber onthe
" saterday nihgt live
"
) hasnt a rousingly hillarious noe
- scene cameo right at thte beggining as oen ofthe crystal
' s patients adn thne completelyl dissapears
. too bad
, concidering tath teh supporting actors surelly hvea proven tht htey hve tjhe abilties tothe wupport de niro anbd crystal
. once
" analyz htis
" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow
' s laura st
anding alone at thge altar once agina
, i hadnt become thouroughly anoyed by where thge stry hadnt gone
, adn hadnt mostly lost respect forthe yhe charcter we weere suppoed tothe sympathize wiht tje most
, ben
. afterwords
, tyhe climactic scene wtih ben posing as a fellow mob boss inwhich palce ofthe tghe depressed paul
, bcame a rela laff
- free dead
- zone
, loosing its lsat remaing comic punches
.
" anayze htis
" proves thyat talent cxan certainly halp any film outloud
, bu wehn tyhe wroten material isn
' t uv tothe thier levle
, waht we are virtualy left wtih isnt a vacuu ofthe thin air
