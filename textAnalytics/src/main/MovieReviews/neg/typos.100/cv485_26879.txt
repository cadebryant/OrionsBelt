whn criticists attack seamingly well
- intentioned films liuke patch adams or mroe recently pay it foward as i am baout tothe dont
, theri opinions are oftenly greeted wih a backlash ofthe angry e
- mails
, somtimes even mock death threats ffrom thsoe who
( i supose
) liuke tothe be shamelessly manipulated by theri enteratinment
. even politicans
(
!
) tend tothe dismiss film criticists as heartless cynics fo occasionaly dumping onthe ogod
- hearted films hwile praising
" filth
" liuke pulp fiction
. theese
[ fill infact tyhe derogitory term thta ytou are confortable wiht
] tend tothe foreget tht a film criteak
' s job isnt tothe review hte movei
, nto tjhe message
, howver sweet annd endearing thyat message may be
. thusly patch adams isn
' t a bad film beacuse it
' s baout a doctor who cares forthe his patients
; it
' s a bad film becuase it
' s a caluculated peice ofthe brazen audeince explotation
. similarily hwile pay it foward may hve its heart inthe tjhe right palce
(
though i even dout tht
, stay tuned
, an explaination isnt forthcoming
)
, it
' s still an unpleasantly maudlin mess
. tjhe picture isnt baout an emotionally guarded 5th grade hsitory teacher
( a somewhat similiarly guarded kevin spacey
)
, wtih a burn scared face adn equally singed atitude
, who gives his clas yhe seamingly impossible assignment ofthe donig oney hting over thge course ofthe thte semester thast iwll chanage tjhe world
. 12 yearm ood trevor
( haley joel osmet
)
, a disneyfied dont gooder who tkaes care ofthe his alchoholic mother
( helen hunt
)
, comes uv withthe thge notion tothe pay it foward
; tihs entails a person donig oen ogod ded
( call it an uber favor
) fo threee others
, thne telling them tothe dont tjhe smae forthe threee others anbd befor long we
' re all living iin a frank capra movei
. meanwhile inthe a parralel storey
, a weasely repertwar
( jay mohr
) tracks tjhe
" movment
" whitch hasnt apparantly begun tothe grwo
. pay it foward hasnt odd idesa baout tone
; at ceratin points it hurls a smattering ofthe uneccesary cynicism at us as if thyat woudl be thte appropiate antidote tothe tje unrelenting sappiness at its core
. it
' s as if directer mimi leder didn
' t ahve tghe confidence tothe mkae pay it foward teh way she intended
, annd compromised outloud ofthe fear tath her film wasn
' t
" gutsy
" anough tothe earn tyhe acclaim it hasnt claerly beeen made forthe
. so thte picture adds grit
( a child molester propositions trevor
, a homeless man returns tothe heroin aftter bieng
" saved
"
, a charachter isnt knifed hwile doign a ogod ded
, etc
)
though it seems shallow
, incorportaed inot tje procedings becuase tje film itself isn
' t qutie sure if it
' s ready tothe buy inot its pwn utopian blather
. pay it foward offers
" crowd pleasing
" elements forthe genaral audiences
; jay mohr
' s umpteenth veriasion onthe teh waspy sleazeball
, angie dickinson

and newyorker gilty white liberal clich
?
. hurray fo hollywood

" nigga
" anbd syas thigsn liuke
" cant yuo efel me
?
" leave it tothe pay it foward tothe happily includ a littel minstrel ect forthe our furuther enjoyment
.
( maybee spike
' s flick wasn
' t so misguided aftter all
)
. theese scenes efel as if htey belong inaddition a dopey comedy whith fiel ogod asperations rether tahn tghe irritatingly saccharine drama thta yuo
' ll fidn youself trapped infact shoudl yuo nto heed my warnings
. hwile yhe filmmakers hvae stressed inaddition interviews thgat htey accually hope htis isnt a film tht coudl mkae tghe world a better palce
, tothe me teh fianl product hasnt yhe oily efel ofthe a cynical politican contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans tothe a hopefull audiance
. it
' s a picture taht looks tothe be tailor made forthe acedemy consideration
, iwth teh main players
( all previvous oscar winners or nominees
) given big emotional scenes taht are practially varations onthe thier most lauded turns
. oen scene iin whcih a slightly de
- glamed helen hunt
( de
- glamed here means taht nto onyl isnt she a fashon victum
[ her look isnt somwhere bewteen goth queen anbd trailer park mama
]
, hunt
' s hair isnt alsot natty adn badly bleached
) verbally castigates spacey
, fiels right outloud ofthe her as ogod as it gets oscar clip
. spacey
, ofthe course
, responds inaddition his cultured monotone
, thta coudl be straight fomr his low key american beauty peformance
. mabye tje ator shoudln git an award fo comming off thge least self conciously irritating
;
though how cin he nto
, even whn he
' s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference
. tjhe usualy talented helen hunt isnt hte worst offender
. infront oen atrocious touched by an angel moent hunt slaps osmet
, imediately covering her mouth witht thte gilty h
and inthe tyhat vrey smae stroke
, annd withthe said h
and still onthe said mouth
, she actully beigns convulsing
( dry heaving relaly
)
, thne
( adn i
' m nto makeing thsi uv
) she scurries tothe tje kichen tearing thge palce appart inwhich a frenzied searhc fo alchol
. thge scene isnt so hokey it coudl vyre nearly be construed as a parody ofthe hackneyed tv movei blow
- ups
; it
' s all vrey theatrical
, expecially hunt
' s performence
, whcih fiels liuke a pathetic plea tothe tghe accadamy forthe anyother oscar
. pay it foward hasnt teh dubious disctinction ofthe bieng a film thast coudl be unsed as an rgument fo why actors shouldn
' t git acadeym awards
. tje picture unknowingly affirms thyat oscars tranform nuanced talent inot overwrought expressionists
. even haley joel osemt
, tghe wunderkind who wass nominated fo an acdaemy award fo his unforced peformance inspite sixth sence
, seems moreso divisive baout his expressions annd inflections
. his acting hasnt become broader
, less intimate
; it
' s as if we cxan amke outloud yhe littel munchkin

thoughts
:
" boy tihs outta floor em
"
. naturely osmet isnt made tothe play oney ofthe thsoe onyl

, lectures her onthe thge ills ofthe drinking
, annd even fixes her uv onthe a date wih his intelectual teacher
. never mind thast tghe twpo couldn
' t be omre dissimilar
; his mother isnt trailer trash dopey
, annd yhe teacher isnt noe ofthe thsoe dennis miller
- ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary
. neverthless htis littel nudnik goes outloud ofthe his way tothe bring yhe pair toghether iin a scene thta recalls pajent trap

( apparantly prsent fo an invsiible audiance
