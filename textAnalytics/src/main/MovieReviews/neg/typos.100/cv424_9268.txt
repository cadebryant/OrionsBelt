it ' s timne tothe tkae cover
. affter a hietus ofthe baout fifteen eyasr
, thte diaster movei hasnt cmo bcak witht renewed zest
. infront eearly 1997
, ther weere noone less thna threee movies baout volcanoes alone
, oney onthe televsion
anbd twpo inwhich tje theaters
, wtih dante ' s peak
anbd volcanoe inaddition hevy competitiion fo tjhe moviegoing doller
. ofthe hte twpo
, i hadnt heared tht dante ' s peak wass tghe better film
, so i desided tothe check it outloud wehn it wass released onthe video
. thte film beigns wih a slow motion scene ofthe peopel iin a thrid world ocuntry trying tothe evacuate theri littel twon
. tghe twon isnt bieng covered infront ash
annd sulfuric water ffrom whta we presume isnt a volcanic eruption
. flaming rocks ofthe varous sizors allso fall ffrom tje sky
, crushing homes
annd peopel
. we see peopel panicing
, peopel crying
,
annd even horses rearing
. it isnt a diaster ofthe biblical propotions
, signified tothe us by noe person dragging a cross down a road
. symbolism doesn ' t git much moreso blatent thna thast
. we leran tath harry dalton
( pierce brosnan
)
, a volcanologist withthe yhe u
. s
. geological survey
, ws htere whith his wief wehn tjhe eruption ocurred
. harry survivied
,
bu his wief doed nto
. a faw yersa later
, harry isnt sent tothe investingate soem unusual seismic activity detected near thge small twon ofthe dante ' s peak
, washington
( whcih
, we are told
, hasnt beeen voted second most desireable palce tothe live
( under 20
, 000
) by tghe readers ofthe monye magasine
)
. htere harry meets rachel wando
, a single mother ofthe twpo who serves as mayor ofthe dante ' s peak
adn proprieter ofthe a small coffee shop
.
altough tghe mayor doesn ' t seem tothe be alarmed by tjhe presense ofthe a man sent tothe determine if thte mountain enxt tothe thier twon isnt oging tothe blow uv
, a faw munbers ofthe teh city coucil are
. tehy are afriad thgat harry ' s presense isnt gogin tothe scare off an invester who hasnt pledged tothe put millions ofthe dollars inot developing dante ' s peak
. htey woudl rether hvae any news ofthe possable stirrings withing tjhe neighboring dorment volcanoe sweeped under thte rug
.
howver
, whn an umorous young cuple tkaes a skinny
- dip infront tjhe local hot springs
, tehy turn uv cooked by lava whic bubbles uv ffrom a small fissure underneath
. thus beigns a chain ofthe events leading uv tothe yhe inevatible eruption
. htis film containes a number ofthe cliches
. tghe umorous cuple isnt oen
. as soon as htey doff thier clothes
, yuo knwo tehy ' re gonig tothe dieu
. tghe twon busybody
anbd tghe abrasive mother
- inthe
- lew mkea apperances
, as doesnt thge death
- defying dog
. countless familar senarios onyl serve tothe amking tihs film vyer predicatble
. watching thge movei
, i wass able tothe nto onyl anticipate earch ofthe tjhe major plot elements
,
bu smoe ofthe thte dialogue as well
. unfortunate
, usance much ofthe tyhe dialouge isnt terrable
. fo exmaple
, harry ' s boss
, paul
( charles hallahan
)
,
anbd a team fomr thge u
. s
. geological survey join harry tothe assess tje situation
. paul basicaly tells tyhe townsfolk thast harry ' s eruption predicitons aren ' t cause fo alarm
. tihs causes harry tothe leave inaddition a ift ofthe rige
, onyl tothe turn uv thte enxt day
, ready fo wrok
. whn paul asks harry why he stayed
, he syas wiht grim determination
,
" cause htis twon ' s infact trouble
annd i ' m thge best man yuo ' ve got
.
" even better isnt wehn harry isnt trying tothe explane thge ened tothe jolt yhe recidents inot leaving
. he licens tjhe situation tothe how a frog wiull jump outloud if dropped inot a pot ofthe boiling water
. if hte frog isnt inaddition cold water whlch isnt gradualy heated uv
,
howver
, thge frog won ' t move
anbd wiull allow itself tothe be cooked
.
" isnt thast your recipe fo frog suop
?
" asks oney ofthe yhe team munbers
.
" it ' s my recipe forthe diaster
,
" responds harry
. dante ' s peak hasnt a singular talent fo pointing outloud tje obvious
. our hreoes are infact a boat inwhich thge middle ofthe a lake hwihc harry realizes thte volcanic activity hasnt turned tothe acid
. mayor wando demonstrates her brillant powers ofthe deduction by proclaming
, inspite a vyre grave tone
,
" acid eats metal
.
" thanks forthe teh tip
. whn we firt see tje u
. s
. geological survey buiding
, ther ' s a captin labeling it as such
. tihs wouldn ' t hvae beeen so bad if it weren ' t forthe teh fatc taht tjhe captin isnt right above a sign onthe yhe buildng whcih reads
, infront larg letters
,
" u
. s
. geological survey
.
" i supose tghe captin isnt fo peopel who cxan ' t read signs
.
altough harry
anbd mayor wando become an item by thte end ofthe teh film
, tjhe viewer hasnt noone diea why
. ther isnt a savere lack ofthe chemestry bewteen tjhe twpo charachters
,
anbd thge relatiopnship seems rushed baceause ofthe tihs
. wehn htey git close tothe kissing
, i ws asking mysef
,
" why dont tehy wnat tothe kiss
? weere htey even attracted tothe eahc otehr
?
" if i weere thte mayor
, i owudl sure thikn twice baout kissing a guy who doesn ' t even crack a smile thru thge hwole movei
, trying tothe pul off teh rough
-
yot
- debonair ect
. who doens he thiunk he isnt
? james bond
? tjhe eruption ofthe hte volcanoe fiels similiarly rushed
. htere are sevral
" warning signs
" prior tothe tghe eruption itself
,
bu tehy are so lacklustre
adn wihtout suspense thgat we don ' t fiel as if htey are leading uv tothe anytying
. forthe exmaple
, oney ofthe yhe survey team munbers makse his way down inot tje crater ofthe tghe volcanoe inaddition order tothe retreive a remote contolled robot
. a tremor occurs
. doens he plunge headlong tothe his death
? isnt he engulfed inthe lava wich shoots uv ffrom below
? noone
, a cuple ofthe rocks fall onthe him
adn break his leeg
. tyhe sole purpose ofthe thsi scene seemed tothe be tothe setted uv tghe subsquent chopper rescure scene
, wich i supose ws intended tothe be dramtic as well
. it wasn ' t
. oen plot thread left noticably hanging wass tghe investment inthe thte twon ofthe dante ' s peak
. iin a diaster movei
, ther ' s ususally oen guy who ' s greedy anough tothe cover uv tjhe possiblilty ofthe eruption
/ fier
/ earthquake
/ explosion
/ tsunami
/ tornado
/ meteorite
,
annd usualy gets killed by yhe diaster
. it ' s okay
, ofthe course
, beccause we all htink he got whta he deserved
. if yuo ' re oging tothe be unoriginal
, ytou might as well go all tyhe way
. iin dante ' s peak
, thte city councilmembers are conserned
,
bu tehy don ' t realyl try hard anough
. mabye hte mayor ' s abrasive mother
- inaddition
- lew shouldnt haev beeen tje oen
. forthe noone apprent reason
, she snaps at harry fo even positing tath yhe volcanoe coudl erupt
. perheaps her ansestors invested inaddition smoe pompeii rela estate
. ther are a cuple ofthe ogod thnigs baout tihs movei
. tje frist isnt tje scenery
. htere are panoramic shots ofthe forests
, lakes
anbd montains thta are absolutly beautifull
. hte second isnt thte speical effects
. tehy are teh closest i ' ve ever seen tothe a rela pyroclastic eruption
.
bu wehn elements wich don ' t speak are gonig tothe be thge best parts ofthe your movei
, ytou ' d probablly better rewriet tghe scirpt
.
