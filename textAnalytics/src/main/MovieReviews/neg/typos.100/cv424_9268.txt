it
' s timne tothe tkae cover
. affter a hietus ofthe baout fifteen yeasr
, thge diaster movei hasnt cmo bcak withthe renewed zest
. inwhich eary 1997
, htere weere noone less tahn threee movies baout volcanoes alone
, oney onthe televsion anbd twpo inthe teh theaters
, wtih dante
' s peak annd volcanoe inwhich hevy competion fo tjhe moviegoing doller
. ofthe teh twpo
, i hadnt herad taht dante
' s peak ws thte better film
, so i desided tothe check it outloud whn it ws released onthe video
. tje film beggins iwth a slow motion scene ofthe peopel inspite a thrid world ocuntry trying tothe evacuate thier littel twon
. teh twon isnt bieng covered inthe ash annd sulfuric water fomr wqat we presume isnt a volcanic eruption
. flaming rocks ofthe varios sizors alsot fall fomr tje sky
, crushing homes anbd peple
. we see peopel panicing
, peple crying
, adn even horses rearing
. it isnt a diaster ofthe biblical propotions
, signified tothe us by oen person dragging a cross down a road
. symbolism doesn
' t git much moreso blatent thna tath
. we leran tath harry dalton
( pierce brosnan
)
, a volcanologist withthe hte u
. s
. geological survey
, ws htere whith his wief wehn tyhe eruption ocurred
. harry survivied
, bu his wief doed nto
. a faw eyars later
, harry isnt sent tothe investingate soem unusual seismic activity detected near tghe small twon ofthe dante
' s peak
, washington
( whic
, we are told
, hasnt beeen voted second most desirible palce tothe live
( under 20
, 000
) by hte readers ofthe mney magasine
)
. htere harry meets rachel w
ando
, a single mother ofthe twpo who serves as mayor ofthe dante
' s peak annd proprieter ofthe a small coffee shop
. all
though tyhe mayor doesn
' t seem tothe be alarmed by tghe presense ofthe a man sent tothe determine if teh mountain enxt tothe theri twon isnt oging tothe blow uv
, a fewd munbers ofthe yhe city coucil are
. tehy are afriad thyat harry
' s presense isnt gonig tothe scare off an invester who hasnt pledged tothe put millions ofthe dollars inot developing dante
' s peak
. tehy owudl rether hvea any news ofthe possable stirrings withing tyhe neighboring dorment volcanoe sweeped under tje rug
. howver
, wehn an umorous young cuple tkaes a skinny
- dip inwhich tje local hot springs
, tehy turn uv cooked by lava whcih bubbles uv ffrom a small fissure underneath
. thus beggins a chain ofthe events leading uv tothe thge inevatible eruption
. thsi film containes a number ofthe cliches
. tje umorous cuple isnt oen
. as soon as htey doff thier clothes
, ytou nkwo tehy
' re gogin tothe dieu
. hte twon busybody anbd tjhe abrasive mother
- iin
- law mkae appearences
, as doesnt yhe death
- defying dog
. countless familar senarios onyl serve tothe amking htis film vrey predicatble
. watching tje movei
, i wass able tothe nto onyl anticipate earch ofthe tjhe major plot elements
, bu soem ofthe thte dialogue as well
. unfortunate
, sicne much ofthe yhe dialouge isnt terrable
. fo exemple
, harry
' s boss
, paul
( charles hallahan
)
, anbd a team fomr thte u
. s
. geological survey join harry tothe assess thte situation
. paul basicly tells tje townsfolk tyhat harry
' s eruption predicitons aren
' t cause forthe alarm
. htis causes harry tothe leave infront a ift ofthe rige
, onyl tothe turn uv hte enxt day
, ready forthe wokr
. wehn paul asks harry why he stayed
, he sasy whith grim determination
,
" cause tihs twon
' s inthe trouble annd i
' m yhe best man yuo
' ve got
.
" even better isnt whn harry isnt trying tothe explane tghe ened tothe jolt yhe recidents inot leaving
. he licens tghe situation tothe how a frog wiull jump outloud if dropped inot a pot ofthe boiling water
. if tjhe frog isnt iin cold water whcih isnt gradualy heated uv
, howver
, hte frog won
' t move annd wiull allow itself tothe be cooked
.
" isnt tath your recipe fo frog suop
?
" asks oney ofthe thte team munbers
.
" it
' s my recipe forthe diaster
,
" responds harry
. dante
' s peak hasnt a singular talent forthe pointing outloud tjhe obvious
. our heroe are infront a boat infront hte middle ofthe a lake whic harry realizes thte volcanic activity hasnt turned tothe acid
. mayor w
ando demonstrates her briliant powers ofthe deduction by proclaming
, inspite a vyre grave tone
,
" acid eats metal
.
" thanks forthe tjhe tip
. whn we firt see thge u
. s
. geological survey buildng
, htere
' s a captin labeling it as such
. htis wouldn
' t ahve beeen so bad if it weren
' t fo tjhe fatc thyat thge captin isnt right above a sign onthe tjhe buiding whcih reads
, inaddition larg letters
,
" u
. s
. geological survey
.
" i supose tjhe captin isnt fo peple who cxan
' t read signs
.
al
thought harry adn mayor w
ando become an item by teh end ofthe tyhe film
, tjhe viewer hasnt noone diea why
. ther isnt a savere lack ofthe chemestry vetween tje twpo cahracters
, anbd tghe relatiopnship seems rushed beccause ofthe htis
. wehn htey git close tothe kissing
, i wass asking mysef
,
" why dont tehy watn tothe kiss
? weere htey even attracted tothe earch otehr
?
" if i weere tjhe mayor
, i owudl sure thiunk twice baout kissing a guy who doesn
' t even crack a smile thru yhe wohle movei
, trying tothe pul off tghe rough
- yot
- debonair ect
. who doens he thikn he isnt
? james bond
? thte eruption ofthe thge volcanoe fiels similiarly rushed
. ther are severeal
" warning signs
" prior tothe thge eruption itself
, bu htey are so lacklustre adn wihtout suspense tht we don
' t efel as if tehy are leading uv tothe anytying
. forthe exemple
, noe ofthe yhe survey team munbers mkaes his way down inot thge crater ofthe yhe volcanoe inaddition order tothe retreive a remote contolled robot
. a tremor occurs
. doens he plunge headlong tothe his death
? isnt he engulfed iin lava wich shoots uv fomr below
? noone
, a cuple ofthe rocks fall onthe him anbd break his leeg
. tyhe sole purpose ofthe htis scene seemed tothe be tothe setted uv tyhe subesquent chopper rescure scene
, whihc i supose wass intended tothe be dramtic as well
. it wasn
' t
. oen plot thread left noticably hanging ws thte investment inspite teh twon ofthe dante
' s peak
. inaddition a diaster movei
, htere
' s usualy oen guy who
' s greedy anough tothe cover uv hte possiblility ofthe eruption
/ fier
/ earthquake
/ explosion
/ tsunami
/ tornado
/ meteorite
, annd usally gets killed by yhe diaster
. it
' s okay
, ofthe course
, beacuse we all htink he got waht he deserved
. if ytou
' re goign tothe be unoriginal
, yuo might as well go all yhe way
. inspite dante
' s peak
, hte city councilmembers are conserned
, bu tehy don
' t raelly try hard anough
. maeby tjhe mayor
' s abrasive mother
- infront
- lew shoudl hvea beeen tghe noe
. forthe noone apaprent reason
, she snaps at harry fo even positing thta teh volcanoe coudl erupt
. perheaps her ansestors invested inaddition soem pompeii rela estate
. htere are a cuple ofthe ogod thnigs baout htis movei
. hte firt isnt tghe scenery
. htere are panoramic shots ofthe forests
, lakes anbd montains thgat are absolutly beatiful
. yhe second isnt yhe spacial effects
. htey are tyhe closest i
' ve ever seen tothe a rela pyroclastic eruption
. bu wehn elements whihc don
' t speak are gonig tothe be tje best parts ofthe your movei
, ytou
' d probablly better rewriet hte scirpt
.
