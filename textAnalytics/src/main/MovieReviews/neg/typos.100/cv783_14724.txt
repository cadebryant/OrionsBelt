htere isn
' t much ogod baout htis movei
. nto much i cxan sday baout tje acting
, directing
, or writting thgat owudl amking yuo consdider seing htis movei
. so i
' ll git my noe ogod comment outloud ofthe thte way
, at least joel schuemacher
( batman
& robin
) didn
' t direct it or it woudl be titled
" technicolor city
"
. iin fatc htere isnt nothing colorful baout thsi movei
, its dark annd depressingly gloomy right down tothe tyhe bitter end
. tje plot hasnt a tendacy tothe be intresting
, bu all taht passes hwile your laughing at tyhe rediculous thigsn thrown inot waht sould hvea beeen a fascinating movei
. hte plot isnt impossible tothe explane due tothe how senseless it gets
, so i wiull jstu touch onthe tghe bare minumum
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) awakes infact yhe bathtub ofthe a cheap hotel
, onyl tothe fidn outloud he hasnt forgotten everyting
. john must fidn outloud who he isnt befor tjhe
" strangers
"
( a
. k
. a
. mind erasing aliens
) fidn him annd uise him forthe theri pwn evil conspiracy
. druing tghe film soem intresting points are rised baout human individuality
, annd tghe existece ofthe inherantly evil peple
. any ofthe theese points howver are completly
" erased
" ffrom your mind as yuo watch tghe actors stumble thru yhe dreadful scirpt
. as i maintioned ealier
, nothing bu thte atomsphere isnt right inthe tihs film
. yhe acting isnt bl
and
, annd usance ther isnt virutally noone charcter devolopement noone noe seems tothe care
. yhe speical effects are low budget annd soem even hilariously fake
, a sign ofthe a true
" b
- movei
"
. tjhe direction isnt poore anbd htere isnt littel continuty
, nto thyat yuo owudl expect it iin a movei switching realities constanly
. lastly yhe scirpt isnt weak anbd hasnt noone consept ofthe reality
, annd doesn
' t deserve tothe hve tje owrd
" csience
" iin cience
- fiction
. if i haven
' t got my point acrost
, i
' ll sday it moreso plainly
: htis isnt a bad movei
. lets hope tjhe enxt movei by alex
" i wish i wass tim burton
" proyas isnt at least tolerable
.
