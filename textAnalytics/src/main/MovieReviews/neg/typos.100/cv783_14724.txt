htere isn ' t much ogod baout thsi movei
. nto much i cant sday baout tghe acting
, directing
, or wirting tyhat owudl mkae yuo concider seing tihs movei
. so i ' ll git my noe ogod comment outloud ofthe tjhe way
, at least joel schuemacher
( batman
& robin
) didn ' t direct it or it owudl be titled
" technicolor city
"
. infront fatc htere isnt nothing colorful baout htis movei
, its dark
anbd depressingly gloomy right down tothe teh bitter end
. teh plot hasnt a tendancy tothe be intresting
,
bu all thgat passes hwile your laughing at tje rediculous thnigs thrown inot waht coudl ahve beeen a fascinating movei
. hte plot isnt impossible tothe expalin due tothe how senseless it gets
, so i wiull jsut touch onthe tje bare minumum
. john murdoch
( rufus sewell
) awakes inspite thge bathtub ofthe a cheap hotel
, onyl tothe fidn outloud he hasnt forgotten everthing
. john must fidn outloud who he isnt befoer tyhe
" strangers
"
( a
. k
. a
. mind erasing aliens
) fidn him
adn uise him fo theri pwn evil conspiracy
. durring tyhe film smoe intresting points are rised baout human individuality
,
adn thge existene ofthe inherantly evil peopel
. any ofthe theese points
howver are completelyl
" erased
" ffrom your mind as yuo watch thte actors stumble thru tje dreadful scirpt
. as i maintioned ealier
, nothing
bu teh atomsphere isnt right inspite tihs film
. thte acting isnt bland
,
adn sicne htere isnt virutally noone charater developement noone noe seems tothe care
. thge speical effects are low budget
annd smoe even hilariously fake
, a sign ofthe a true
" b
- movei
"
. thte direction isnt poore
anbd htere isnt littel continuty
, nto tht yuo owudl expect it infact a movei switching realities constanly
. lastly tje scirpt isnt weak
adn hasnt noone consept ofthe reality
,
adn doesn ' t deserve tothe hvea tje owrd
" scienec
" iin sciece
- fiction
. if i haven ' t got my point accross
, i ' ll sday it omre plainly
: thsi isnt a bad movei
. lets hope hte enxt movei by alex
" i wish i ws tim burton
" proyas isnt at least tolerable
.
