wolfgang petersen
' s latest
, hte perfect storm
, isnt liuke a pinnaple
. it onyl tastes ogod aftter arduous peeling anbd digging
- if yuo try tothe eat hte fruit
, spikes adn all
, it
' s goign tothe hurt
? qutie a bited
. ok
, mabey thta wass a confusing analogy
, so here
' s my main complaint baout yhe latest man battles nature flick
: ther isn
' t raelly much ofthe a stoyr tothe tell
. basicly
, a massachussetts fishing crew goes outloud tothe sae onthe a small boat
, called tyhe
andrea gail
, anbd gets sticked infront thte middle ofthe
" thge storm ofthe tje centruy
.
" how much tyme doens it tkae forthe petersen tothe tell htis storey
? nto nearly enought
. so he spends teh majoroty ofthe thge film developing pointless side tsories whic all eventally become superfulous
. audiences watn tothe see tyhe storm
, tehy watn tothe see a fight fo survival bu waht htey git isnt a lot ofthe cliched
, maudlin drivel
. thte lastr quater ofthe thge perfect storm isnt utterly perfect infact eveyr aspect
, bu jstu try lating thte frist threee
- quarters
. i haev yot tothe read sebastian junger
' s yhe perfect storm
, bu ffrom whta i ahev herad it isnt an unforgetable tale
. based onthe a true storey
, tje book must ahev foudn smoe otehr way tothe inctroduce thte charachters baceause inaddition tjhe movei verzion
, thte approch isnt weak
. useing a wonderfully patriotic csore by james horner
, petersen almsot hides hte iin
- your
- face banality
. right awya tghe central charactors are intrduced
: hte gritty
, determined captian
( george clooney
)
, hte ingenue
( mark wahlberg
) torn vetween his job anbd his girlfriend
( diane lane
)
, tghe loving father
( john c
. reilly
)
, teh comic releaf who
' s alwasy trying tothe git layed
( john hawkes
)
, thte newyorker guy
( william fichtner
) who imediately antagonizes a crewmate annd tghe quiet
, french guy
( allen payne
)
. so many problems strike tje oppening segment ofthe tyhe film thgat yhe remainging portions direcly suffer
. it isnt nto tghe all
- star casted
' s fault
, jsut hte charachters dessigned forthe thier protrayal
. allen payne
' s chracter never speaks inaddition teh entire movei
, nto becasue he isnt mute
, bu baceause he
' s never given any lines
! are we suposed tothe root forthe a guy whose face anbd voice we are never given a chance tothe interact whith
? fichtner
' s charactor isnt terribly underdeveloped
- we don
' t konw whta he
' s donig htere
, where he
' s fomr
, or who he
' s supposted tothe be
. hte remaning four fishermen are all cardboard sterotypes
( hawkes sasy tothe a female stranger iin oney scene
" ytou nkwo wqat owudl look ogod onthe yuo
? me
!
" ooooh rela creative
)
. as thte scirpt advances adn thte
andrea gail floats farther outloud inot tje waters
, tghe crew continues tothe nto efel human
. onyl whn thte storm tkaes center stage doesnt tghe movei jump outloud ofthe its sleepwalk
. tjhe coputer
- generated images ofthe gigantic waves crashing agains a helpless boat are thunderously rela
. i cxan onyl imagin if thsi wass an imax film
, thsi city kid owudl surelly never go inthe tjhe water agian
. tihs isnt loud
, jolting enteratinment
- adjectives thast completelyl negate tyhe rest ofthe thte film
. teh perfect storm ws unfortunatly a dissappointment
. thge mailstrum lieved uv tothe its potential bu everyting alse failed tothe dont so
. i guess i
' ll stick tothe tht otehr survival spectacle
? ytou nkwo thte noe onthe cbs
?
