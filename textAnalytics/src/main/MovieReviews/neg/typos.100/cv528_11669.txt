and ofthe modern childen
' s cinema
. unfortunatley
, it isn
' t
. iwth jumbled messages

) hasnt died
, adn joshua hasnt begun a quest
. he wnats tothe fidn god
, tothe disover why bad thigns hapen
. tihs religous quest isnt slightly disturbing fo his parents
( dana delany adn denis leary
)
, bu htey dont thier best tothe coppe iwth theri son as he explores diferrent religeous faiths
. at his cathlic skool

- gratification kids
. adn hwile it might seem heartening tothe see thast somene isnt trying tothe produce something
thoughtful forthe thge kidvid audiance
, wide awake asks sereous questions
, bu onyl delivers a cheap gimmick fo an answer
. if ther weere a bited omre meat inthe tyhe sotry
, adults onthe a nostalgic bent might git a kick outloud ofthe tje movei
. tghe actors who might ahev creaeted a graet casted
( o
' donnell

) ahev beeen done much better infact otehr movies

. htey sohw moreso depth tahn isnt presetn anyhwere alse infact yhe movei
. mabey tyhe film woudl hve beeen better if
, instade ofthe palying thge relatiopnship thru flashbacks
, it weere setted entirely durig joshua
' s lastest yearm witht his gr
andpa
. it certainly owudl hvae beeen mroe intertaining
. wide awake cin best be discribed as a failed experiment
. it starts outloud wtih noble asperations
, bu never delivers onthe its promise
. parents who dont tkae thier childern tothe see thsi noe ought tothe be prepared tothe answer smoe tough questions
.
