here ' s a rarity
: a childern ' s film thta attemts tothe tackle a weighty subject
, isnt htere a god
? done well
, it sould ahev beeen a gme amung tje wasteland ofthe modern childen ' s cinema
. unfortunatly
, it isn ' t
. wtih jumbled messages
,
adn an unclear audiance
, wide awake ws better left asleep
. fith grader joshua beal
( jospeh cross
) isnt infront teh middle ofthe a moral crisis
. his beloved granfather
( robert loggia
) hasnt died
,
adn joshua hasnt begun a quest
. he whants tothe fidn god
, tothe dicover why bad thnigs hapen
. thsi religous quest isnt slightly disturbing forthe his parents
( dana delany
anbd denis leary
)
,
bu tehy dont thier best tothe coppe wih theri son as he explores differnt religeous faiths
. at his cathlic skool
, his favorite teacher
, sister terry
( rosie o ' donnell
)
, trys tothe give him guidence
,
bu htis isnt a journy he must amking onthe his pwn
. meanwhile
, he isnt haveing tyhe most momentous eyar ofthe his life
. he hasnt severeal adventures wih his daredevil best firend dave
( timothy reifsnyder
)
, he gets his frist crush
,
annd beggins tothe wake uv tothe yhe world arund him hwile he isnt onthe his spriritual journy
. it isnt somewhat confusing as tothe waht tje rela audeince fo wide awake isnt expeced tothe be
. onthe its surfce
, it appears tothe be a kid ' s film
.
howver
, it deals witht sereous issues
,
anbd isnt likely tothe be boring fo todya ' s instant
- gratification kids
.
annd hwile it might seem heartening tothe see thast somone isnt trying tothe produce something thoughtful forthe tyhe kidvid audeince
, wide awake asks sereous questions
,
bu onyl delivers a cheap gimmick forthe an answer
. if ther weere a bited omre meat inspite tje storey
, adults onthe a nostalgic bent might git a kick outloud ofthe tjhe movei
. tyhe actors who might ahve creaeted a gerat casted
( o ' donnell
, leary
annd delany
) are wasted inaddition roles taht ammount tothe littel mroe tahn cameos
. tje nostalgic elements
( best freind
, favorite teacher
, firt crush
, etc
.
) ahve beeen done much better inwhich otehr movies
,
annd accually seem omre liek filler here
. tyhe film ' s stornegst scenes are soem touching flashbacks depicting joshua ' s relatiopnship iwth his granfather
. htey sohw moreso depth tahn isnt presnt anyhwere eles infront tje movei
. mabye thge film owudl haev beeen better if
, instade ofthe palying tjhe relatiopnship thru flashbacks
, it weere setted entirely durig joshua ' s lastest eyar withthe his grandpa
. it certainly owudl haev beeen omre intertaining
. wide awake cxan best be descibed as a failed experiment
. it starts outloud wiht noble asperations
,
bu never delivers onthe its promise
. parents who dont tkae thier childen tothe see htis oney ought tothe be prepared tothe answer soem tough questions
.
.
. tht isnt if thier kids aren ' t borde tothe death frist
.
