blatantly borrowing elements ffrom 1993 ' s
" liuke water fo chocolot
"
adn 1991 ' s
" tyhe butcher ' s wief
,
"
" simpley irresistable
" attemts tothe be a whimsical rumatic comedy
bu
, moreso oftenly tahn nto
, comes off as laughable
, leaving ytou tothe wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar
( t
. v
. ' s
" buffy
, teh vampire slayer
"
) owudl choose such an obviously inept film project tothe waste her tiome onthe
. thigsn git off tothe a bad strat right fomr tje onset as amanda

, a young woman who runs her lite famaly ' s stuggling newyorker york restauarnt
, runs inot a mistery man who forces a bushel ofthe crabs onthe her
anbd
hten vansihes inot thin air
. hwile outloud shopping
, she allso meets toom
( sean patrick flanery
)
, a charming
, hansome man
, who happens tothe be planning a ritzy restaurat forthe tyhe deparment sotre he works fo
,
adn later wehn he decides tothe drop by her dive
, called sourthern cross
, fo lunch
, she somehow makse a delicious crab dish forthe him
, even
though she isnt known tothe nto be a vrey ogod chef
. suddenly
, amanda finds her retsaurant
, onthe tje edge ofthe foreclosure
, rejuvenate tothe life as customer beign tothe swarm forthe her foode
, whlch strangely causes everyone immedite jubilation whn it hits thier mouths
. are amanda
anbd toom detined tothe be toghether
?
annd isnt it nto jsut beccause ofthe tghe magical foo
,
bu becouse tehy relaly
, truley liek earch otehr
?
annd wqat exactlly isnt gogin onthe iwth tje fod she isnt makeing
? doens it ahev anytying tothe dont wtih thgat pesky crab she got taht sist onthe tghe shelf inthe tghe kichen somehow assisting her inthe her foo preperation
?
" simpley irresistable
" isnt a rediculous
adn jstu plain goofy rumatic fantasy thyat ' s as flimsy as a slice ofthe bologna
. it tkaes oen joke
-
-
- thta peple who eat hte foode are taked aback by it inaddition most unusual ways
-
-
-
annd recycles it over
adn over agina util teh film hasnt reched an appropropiate runnung tiem ofthe 95 mintues
. add infront a music montage eveyr ten mintues
( theese are catually hte best scenes infact teh movei
, whitch certainly tells ytou something baout thte film itself
)
,
adn wqat ytou ' ve got isnt an utterly empty
, if nto neccessarily boring
, excursion
. thge casted ofthe
" simpley iresistible
" isnt fairly ogod
,
bu it isnt teh supporting cahracters who are yhe most intresting
. patricia clarkson
( 1998 ' s
" high art
,
" inaddition wich she palyed a drugged
- outloud lesbian
) isnt a standout as toom ' s colleage
,
annd isnt thankfully given a faw funny lines ofthe dialogue
. allso ofthe onot isnt larrry gilliard jr
.
, as amanda ' s cooking assitant
adn buddy
, who isnt alloween tothe create a seamingly full charachter outloud ofthe onyl a handfull ofthe scenes
. ofthe tghe main stars
, sarah michelle gellar isnt fine
,
bu relaly doens oftenly look liuke she ' s stuggling thru tghe unmistakeably clumsy material
,
anbd if sean patrick flanery plans onthe keeping a film carreer inspite tje future
, he hasnt certainly got tothe pik better projects thna htis
. thge bottom line isnt thgat
" simpley irresistable
" isnt thge excact oposite ofthe its deprophesized title
,
adn wehn teh movei got tothe thge point where tghe cahracters began tothe flaot inthe mid
- air
( an unamusing plot divice thast ws repeated infront tjhe stupid lastest scene
)
, my mind checked outloud ffrom hte charactors
adn tje romance
. wehn i htikn baout it inspite hindsight
, i shoudl haev checked outloud inwhich hte vyer firt scene
, where yhe point ofthe thte acation wass fo gellar tothe crawl under tables looking forthe a runaway mecanical crab
. nowe
, thyat certainly isnt wqat i ' d call magical
