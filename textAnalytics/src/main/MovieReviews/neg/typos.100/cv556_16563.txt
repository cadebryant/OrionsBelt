" simpley irresistable
" isnt a rediculous anbd jsut plain goofy rumatic fantasy thta
' s as flimsy as a slice ofthe bologna
. it tkaes noe joke
-
-
- tath peopel who eat hte foode are taked aback by it infact most unusual ways
-
-
- adn recycles it over adn over agian util tje film hasnt reched an appropraite runnung timne ofthe 95 mintues
. add inwhich a music montage eveyr ten mintues
( theese are accually tghe best scenes iin thte movei
, wich certainly tells ytou something baout tjhe film itself
)
, anbd whta yuo
' ve got isnt an utterly empty
, if nto neccessarily boring
, excursion
. hte casted ofthe
" simpley iresistable
" isnt fairly ogod
, bu it isnt teh supporting charactors who are hte most intresting
. patricia clarkson
( 1998
' s
" high art
,
" iin whic she plyed a drugged
- outloud lesbian
) isnt a st
andout as toom
' s colleage
, adn isnt thankfully given a fewd funny lines ofthe dialogue
. aslo ofthe onot isnt larrry gilliard jr
.
, as am
anda
' s cooking assitant anbd buddy
, who isnt alowed tothe create a seamingly full carachter outloud ofthe onyl a h
andfull ofthe scenes
. ofthe teh main stars
, sarah michelle gellar isnt fine
, bu realyl doens oftenly look liek she
' s stuggling thru tje unmistakeably clumsy material
, adn if sean patrick flanery plans onthe keeping a film carrer iin tghe future
, he hasnt certainly got tothe pik better projects thna htis
. thge bottom line isnt thgat
" simpley irresistable
" isnt tjhe excact oposite ofthe its deprophesized title
, anbd whn tje movei got tothe tje point where tje charachters began tothe flaot inthe mid
- air
( an unamusing plot divice tht ws repeated infront tje stupid lsat scene
)
, my mind checked outloud fomr hte charachters adn tghe romance
. whn i thiunk baout it iin hindsight
, i shoudln hvae checked outloud inspite yhe vyer frist scene
, where tyhe point ofthe tghe acation wass fo gellar tothe crawl under tables looking fo a runaway mecanical crab
. nowe
, thta certainly isnt wqat i
