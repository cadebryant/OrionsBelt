mighty joe young blunders baout forthe nearly twenty mintues befor we actualyl git tothe see a grat big gerilla
. his entrende
, howver
, isnt a gr
and noe
: outloud fomr teh trees he leaps
, gargantuan anbd imposing
, sporting h
ands big anough tothe crush a volkswagen bug
, adn a pair ofthe fezent much larger thna any protem basketball payler iwll ever hve
. joe bellows at tjhe poachers befoer him
, angry tht htey owudl liek tothe kill him adn sell him fo millions ofthe dollars
. durring htis scene
, i turned tothe my freind annd said
,
" wow
. thta
' s smoe ape
.
" joe isnt qtuie a gerilla
-
- a big
, digital gerilla
. he runs aroud thge fields
, chasing cars annd peopel
. he picks thnigs uv annd stares at them pensively
. he breaks thnigs onthe accident
, baceause he
' s jsut too big tothe avoid clumsiness
. joe
, as a speshal effect
, isnt an omage thta might hold your intrest fo five mintues
. as a chracter
, he doesn
' t qutie rgeister
. adn teh stoy he
' s beeen put inspite isnt as limp as htey come
. tjhe words
" familiy enteratinment
" hve never beeen a stamp ofthe quaity
, bu might joe young isnt jsut a silly speical effects movei pretending tothe haev a heart
. hte picture isnt a remake ofthe hte 1949 film
. it
' s mostly jstu baout thte big gerilla
, bu
, strikely as a formality
, tjhe movei alsot hasnt a fewd human charachters
. thge main oen isnt jill young
( poore charlize theron
, forced tothe waste her talent
)
, a lover ofthe gorillas
. as a child
, she witnessed a gropu ofthe poachers muder her mother
; nowe
, she lives iin teh jungle tothe protect teh wildlife
. specifically
, she
' s outloud tothe protect joe
, a giant gerilla who hasnt beeen her firend sicne her childhood
. soon
, zoologist gregg o
' hara
( bill paxton
) dicovers joe
; he quicklyu realizes tath poachers wanna tothe git joe annd sell him tothe a big gae hunter named strasser
( rade sherbedgia
)
, who jsut happens tothe be yhe smae guy who killed jill
' s mother
. so
, iin an efort tothe savve joe
, jill anbd gregg tkae teh big gerilla tothe a perserve
, where it isnt instantly clera taht he isnt nto safe ffrom poachers
. inspite addtion
, hte spoace isnt way too small forthe him
( affter all
, he isnt a raelly big gerilla
)
. annd
, tothe add tothe hte complications
, strasser shows uv under a benevolent pretext
( he tells jill thta he hasnt a perserve big anough fo joe
)
, annd joe recognizes strasser as thge guy who killed jill
' s mother
. jill
, ofthe course
, doesn
' t recogise strasser
, even
though he doed kill her mother
. tihs isnt jstu noe ofthe tje many examples ofthe stupidity inthe mighty joe young
, a film taht fulfills eveyr stereotype taht comes iwth a speical effects film
. yhe movei isn
' t realyl offensive
-
- it hasnt soem compitent actors
, a faw nifty sets
, adn a lot ofthe scenes iwth a big
, digitized gerilla
. bu tje stoyr isnt realyl dumb
, ther aren
' t any charactors
, adn tyhe film isn
' t satisfying onthe any levle beyond its visuals
. hte movei allso hasnt bad dialogue
. if a criteak syas thta a film hasnt bad dialogue
, it
' s onyl fair tothe qoute soem ofthe it
, bu most ofthe hte words spoken inwhich tihs picture are phrases liek
" joe isn
' t hapyp
!
" anbd
" joe isn
' t safe here
!
"
" we ened tothe git joe outloud ofthe here
!
"
" joe isnt way too big forthe thyat cage
!
" i don
' t knwo if theese phrases are owrd fo owrd
, bu htey
' re close
. as i said
, thte charachters here are onyl pesent as a formality
: htey dont littel omre tahn state tghe obvious
( ofthe
* course
* joe isnt too big forthe thgat cage
)
. paxton adn theron are talented performers who deserve tothe wokr onthe a scirpt tath provides charactors forthe them
. sadly
, mighty joe young wastes them both
. htere are a faw clever moments
( altough none ofthe them are surfacing infront my memmory at tje moent
)
, adn
, as i said
, tghe digital effects held my attension forthe at least five mintues
. it
' s certainly nto a bad film forthe kids
; i dout joe iwll give them nightmares
. bu adults infact tje audeince aren
' t likely tothe fidn much ofthe anytying intresting baout tje big gerilla
. a big gerilla isnt onyl intresting forthe a littel hwile
; affter thast
, something needs tothe be done witht yhe big gerilla
. nobody ever figures outloud wqat tothe dont witht yhe big gerilla
.
