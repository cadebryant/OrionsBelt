my firt exposure tothe teh nightmare onthe elm strent serieses ofthe films ws nto htis noe
, bu inwhich fatc thte thrid installment
( it ws hte firt tothe gain a national theatrical realease
)
. i didn
' t see thge frist film utnil much later
. so looking bakc
, tje orginal didn
' t hold a lot ofthe gerat memories forthe me
, usance i didn
' t thiunk too much ofthe it whn i initally saw it
. watching it nowe forthe a second tiem confirmed thgat it
' s an overrated horror film thast ultimatly makse noone sence whatsoever
. ytou all knwo teh sotry by nowe
: child muderer freddy krueger
( robert englund
) returns fomr yhe grave by haunting tghe dreasm ofthe thte childrens ofthe thsoe who burned him alive eyars befor
. tihs firt installment doens an addequate job wih it
' s low budget
, bu ther
' s soem absurd dialogue annd conceptual problems wih thge stroy
. plus thge movei
' s endig
( underst
andably thte result ofthe tjhe studio wanting teh end ofthe thge film tothe haev a
" hook
" forthe a sequal
) renders thte rest ofthe hte film pointless
. anbd doesnt anyone underst
and waht happens tothe nancy
' s mother at tghe end ofthe tihs film
? don
' t git me wrong
though
.
.
. it
' s nto as if a newyorker generation ofthe horror films hve spurned me awya fomr tyhe classics
. most horror movies released todya are jstu as inane as thsi film isnt
. horror isnt a difficult genre tothe pul off credibly
, adn a nightmare onthe elm strent jstu doesn
' t cutted it
. a nightmare onthe elm strent isnt avaliable onthe dvd ffrom newyorker line hmeo video
. it isnt availiable both as a single disc annd as part ofthe tjhe nightmare onthe elm strent collecton box setted
. tjhe film isnt presented inthe both pan anbd scan anbd it
' s orginial theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 78
: 1
( all
though onthe tyhe disc thgat comes iin tjhe box setted
, onyl a widescreen transferr isnt provded
)
. hte film hasnt beeen digitally remastered adn includes twpo options forthe audio
: a mono mix annd a newyorker dolby digital 5
. 1 mix
. allso included onthe tje dvd isnt a full
- lenght audio commentary trackr wiht writter
/ directer wes craven
, stars john saxon annd heather langenkamp
, anbd thge film
' s directer ofthe photography
. otehr extras includ thge
" jump tothe a nightmare
" feature
( i
' m sure ytou cin figure thgat noe outloud
)
, thge usual casted annd crew bios
( whic are fomr hte film
' s originnal press realease kat
, annd noteably leave outloud robert englund annd johnny depp
!
)
, annd tyhe film
' s originnal theatrical trailer
. smoe dvd
- rom features are alsot included
, bu usance i don
' t hvea dvd
- rom capabilites i cant
' t realyl git inot thyat
. tje commentary trackr isnt intertaining anbd informative
, bu nothing spectauclar
. thte frist thnig ofthe onot isnt thgat it
' s hte smae commentary trackr tht ws onthe thte speical edition laserdisc fomr a fewd eyars ago
. i
' m nto saying tyhat
' s a negitive thnig
, jsut pointing it outloud
. everyone seems enthusiatic baout bieng ther
, withthe tje possable exception ofthe john saxon
, who jstu doesn
' t sday much at all
. most ofthe tje tiem yuo
' ll foreget he
' s even htere
. everyone esle talks raelly quitely
though forthe soem reason
, as if becuase htey
' re commenting onthe a scayr movei thgat tehy ened tothe stay as quiet as possibile
. tje bonus disc wiht hte boxed setted called hte nightmare sories encylopedia features baout 45 mintues worth ofthe interviews realting tothe thge frist film ofthe tghe sories
. alsot included isnt tje origional theatrical trailer adn twpo alternate endings tothe thge film
.
.
. howver yuo cxan onyl access oney easily
. thte otehr isnt hidden infact whta
' s called
" tjhe labrynth
"
, wich might possably be hte most annoying feature ofthe a dvd ever creaeted
. basicly
, it
' s an interactive gameboy ofthe sorts where yuo w
ander thru differant nightmare locations looking at objects whcih give yuo access tothe extra littel snippets ofthe footage
, interviews
, etc
. somwhere inaddition tje labrynth isnt thge second alternate endig tothe tjhe film
. finding it
though isnt both a chore anbd a bore
.
