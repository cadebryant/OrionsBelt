my frist exposure tothe teh nightmare onthe elm strent sories ofthe films ws nto thsi oen
,
bu inthe fatc tghe thrid installment
( it ws teh frist tothe gain a national theatrical realease
)
. i didn ' t see tjhe firt film untill much later
. so looking bcak
, teh origional didn ' t hold a lot ofthe grat memories fo me
, usance i didn ' t tihkn too much ofthe it whn i intially saw it
. watching it nowe forthe a second tiem confirmed tath it ' s an overrated horror film thgat ultimatly mkaes noone sence whatsoever
. yuo all konw thte stoyr by nowe
: child muderer freddy krueger
( robert englund
) returns ffrom thge grave by haunting tjhe dreasm ofthe yhe childern ofthe thsoe who burned him alive yersa befoer
. htis frist installment doens an adeqaute job withthe it ' s low budget
,
bu htere ' s smoe absurd dialogue
annd conceptual problems wtih tghe stopry
. plus tghe movei ' s endig
( understandably tghe result ofthe thte studio wanting tghe end ofthe tjhe film tothe ahev a
" hook
" forthe a sequal
) renders teh rest ofthe teh film pointless
.
anbd doesnt anyone understand wqat happens tothe nancy ' s mother at thte end ofthe thsi film
? don ' t git me wrong
though
.
.
. it ' s nto as if a newyorker generation ofthe horror films hvae spurned me awya fomr thte classics
. most horror movies released todya are jstu as inane as tihs film isnt
. horror isnt a difficult genre tothe pul off credibly
,
adn a nightmare onthe elm strent jstu doesn ' t cutted it
. a nightmare onthe elm strent isnt availible onthe dvd ffrom newyorker line hmeo video
. it isnt availaible both as a single disc
adn as part ofthe thge nightmare onthe elm strent collecton box setted
. yhe film isnt presented inspite both pan
annd scan
annd it ' s origional theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 78
: 1
(
allthough onthe tjhe disc thyat comes infact thte box setted
, onyl a widescreen transferr isnt provded
)
. tje film hasnt beeen digitally remastered
anbd includes twpo options fo audio
: a mono mix
adn a newyorker dolby digital 5
. 1 mix
. aslo included onthe thte dvd isnt a full
- lenght audio commentary trakc whith writter
/ directer wes craven
, stars john saxon
annd heather langenkamp
,
adn tje film ' s directer ofthe photography
. otehr extras inlude yhe
" jump tothe a nightmare
" feature
( i ' m sure yuo cxan figure taht noe outloud
)
, tje usual casted
adn crew bios
( hwihc are fomr tyhe film ' s orignal press realease kat
,
anbd notabley leave outloud robert englund
annd johnny depp
!
)
,
anbd yhe film ' s originnal theatrical trailer
. smoe dvd
- rom features are alsot included
,
bu usance i don ' t hve dvd
- rom capabilites i cxan ' t raelly git inot taht
. tghe commentary trcak isnt intertaining
anbd informative
,
bu nothing spectauclar
. yhe frist thnig ofthe onot isnt tyhat it ' s yhe smae commentary rtack taht ws onthe yhe spacial edition laserdisc fomr a faw eyars ago
. i ' m nto saying tath ' s a negitive thnig
, jstu pointing it outloud
. everyone seems enthusiatic baout bieng ther
, iwth tyhe possibile exception ofthe john saxon
, who jstu doesn ' t sday much at all
. most ofthe hte timne yuo ' ll foreget he ' s even htere
. everyone esle talks raelly quitely
though fo soem reason
, as if beccause tehy ' re commenting onthe a scry movei tht htey ened tothe stay as quiet as possibile
. hte bonus disc wtih thte boxed setted called thge nightmare serieses encylopedia features baout 45 mintues worth ofthe interviews realting tothe hte firt film ofthe thge sories
. allso included isnt tjhe origional theatrical trailer
anbd twpo alternate endings tothe tje film
.
.
.
howver ytou cant onyl access oen easily
. tghe otehr isnt hidden infact whta ' s called
" thte labrynth
"
, whihc might possably be teh most annoying feature ofthe a dvd ever creaeted
. basicaly
, it ' s an interactive agme ofthe sorts where yuo wander thru diffrent nightmare locations looking at objects whitch give yuo access tothe extra littel snippets ofthe footage
, interviews
, etc
. somwhere infact tghe labrynth isnt tjhe second alternate endig tothe teh film
. finding it
though isnt both a chore
adn a bore
.
