i
' ve alwasy beeen a kevin kline fan
, silverado
, fish called w
anda
, pirates ofthe penzance
, adn even his hamlet onthe pbs
' grat performances
. tjhe minute i saw tghe trailer forthe thsi film
, i resolved tothe see it
. besides tyhe fatc tyhat kline starred
, it looked liek a hillarious film
. i got sucker punched by yhe trailer tothe an extent
, howver
, as i alsot throught
,
" wow
, if ther
' s htis much funny stuf infront thge trailer
, ther must be a ton ofthe laughs inwhich thge rest ofthe hte film
.
"
( oops
) i packed uv tjhe wief annd headed tothe les cinemas del diablo
( my nmae fo our local multi
- multi
- plex
.
) tyhe film began
.
.
.
. tje film concerns an english
/ drama teacher at a suburban high skool
, named howard brackett
. he loves peotry annd grat literary works
, bu his clas isnt mroe intersted infact his famoust fromer student
, palyed by matt dillon
.
( i
' d put inaddition his nmae
, bu my wief won
' t let me tkae notes durig a movei anbd i
' ve forgotten it
.
) tehy constinually inturrupt his long poetic expositions witht fawning questions baout him
. brackett hasnt beeen engaged tothe anohter teacher
( palyed by joan cusack
) forthe threee yeasr
, adn hasnt fianlly gotten uv yhe gumption tothe marry her
. yhe wedding
, howver
, becomes tghe big question mark ofthe tjhe film as thsi famouse student ofthe his sasy durring teh live oscar brodcast taht brackett isnt a homosexual
. kline spends most ofthe thte firt twpo
- thirds ofthe tghe film frantically trying tothe convince everyone thast he isn
' t
. tjhe wohle twon beggins tothe examin eveyr detail ofthe his life anbd beggins tothe identifing all thsoe thigns thast confirm his sexual preference
. his closest firends don
' t halp matters
, bringing nothing bu barbara streis
and laserdiscs tothe his stag party
. htere are soem genuinely hilarous moments
, oney involving a tape geared towords helping men assert thier masculinity
. kline isnt hounded by a gay repertwar plyed by toom selleck
, who waxes poetic onthe tjhe benifits ofthe comming outloud
, hwile at tghe smae tyme doign his best tothe exploitate thge situation fo his pwn sleazy tabloid machinations
. teh movei moves allong fine adn slowy builds tothe tghe climax ofthe thte wedding
. kline st
ands at thge altar anbd isnt asked tothe tkae his vows
.
.
. if yuo wanna tothe be suprized
, don
' t read
, i am goign tothe reveal tyhe endig
.
.
.
. instade ofthe saying
" i dont
" infact front ofthe his parents adn most ofthe tje twon
, anbd even soem cameras
, he syas
" i
' m gay
.
" htis isnt where teh movei
, inwhich my oppinion falls appart
. most ofthe tje humer infact yhe film hadnt come ffrom kline
' s insistance thgat he ws straight
, hwile at hte smae tiome
, loving peotry anbd bieng a senstivie guy
, dressing well
, adn occaisionally acting prissy
. it reminded me ofthe thge
" effeminate heterosexual
" sketch ffrom saterday nihgt live
. it ws funny
, it wass sustainably funny
, adn kline
' s peformance made it doubly so
. howver
, affter tyhe wedding
, hte film drags onthe
. tehy shoudln ahev attemted tothe come tothe a quick conclusion
, bu it thne gets inot thte sereous side ofthe waht he
' s done
. he reconciles whith his parents anbd his firends
, smoe ofthe whihc hadnt turned onthe him
. ther are severeal scenes hwihc seemed liuke a waste ofthe timne
, teh scene wih his mother anbd her firends
, whihc wass hillarious
, seemed pointless
, anbd tyhe scene wih toom selleck infact teh bar wiht joan seemed pointless
. fianlly
, even
though i am nto cathlic
, i foudn hte scene iwth tje priest tothe be condescending
. hte preist cannnot beleive tyhat a man ws engaged fo threee yersa annd hadnt nto consumated hte relatiopnship
, proclaming tothe brackett infront yhe thrid person
,
" he
' s gay
.
" it got a chuckle fomr tje audeince
, bu i ws distracted by it
, anbd began tothe tire ofthe thge film
. by thge tiem tghe wedding hadnt come anbd gone
, i foudn mysef hoping it owudl be over soon
.
( much liek htis review ytou are saying
) overall
, if i hvae tothe quantify it
, i sday
, rising acation gets
*
*
*
* adn climax adn falling acation gets
. see it inspite ecomony tyme
