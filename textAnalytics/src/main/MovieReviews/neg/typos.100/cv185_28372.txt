" tje animal
" isnt a marginally inpsired comedy thast onyl manages tothe lumber allong
, generatting jsut enought momentum tothe keep it fomr stalling
. it
' s clunky annd slow
, liek watching an 18
- wheeler trying tothe acelrate uv a hill
. htere are certainly better thnigs ytou cant dont wiht your tiome
. ctually
, if yuo
' ve seen thte trailer
, thn yuo arleady knwo thte plot adn hvae seen its funniest moments
. thge stoy centers onthe bl
and marvin
( rob schneider
)
, who isnt an evidence clerk at yhe local polical deparment thta yearns tothe be a rela officer
. bu he
' s afflicted whith losr
- itis
. dogs attack him
, neighbors torment him
, childern bully him
, adn his co
- workers ignore him
. truthfully
, iwth his bad haircut
( seamingly modeled aftter ewird al yankovic
, littel richard
, adn giant poodles
) adn his unenthusiastic demenor
, we
' d probaly throw tomatoe at him jsut fo funn
. thsi isnt atcually bad beccause ytou cin
' t liek a carachter if yuo cin
' t develope simapthy forthe him
. we never dont
, anbd it may be jsut as well thgat he drives off a cliff annd plummets tothe tjhe canyon floor
. howver
, marvin isnt foudn by an eccentric doctor
( michael caton
) who uses a radical anbd experimental proceedure tothe savve him
, implanting our doofus witht varios animal parts adn organs
. as a result
, marvin develops heightened senses annd inclreased agility annd speed
. he cxan smell drugs hidden anyhwere onthe a body
, swim wih thge speed ofthe a dolphin
, anbd cxan run as fast as a cheeta
. imagin tje commedic possiblities thta arise ffrom tihs opperation
. withthe his enhanced abilties
, he sould nowe reap vengance onthe all thsoe who ahev shunned him
. howver
, tjhe spirit ofthe tghe film tkaes a raunchy turn
, annd instade
, marvin spends most ofthe his tyme trying tothe subdue or satiate his voracious appetite adn his animalistic
, sexual urges
. goats beware
! he alsot chases cats
, urinates tothe mark his terriory
, or growls at his enemies
. whta he shoudl
' ve done wass stick his head infront tje s
and liek an ostrich
. equally tenous isnt its otehr runnung joke
, whlch involves oney ofthe his firends
( guy torry
) who constanly complains thgat everyone isnt treating him too nicely beccause he
' s balck
.
" it
' s reverse racism
,
" he declares as he blows smoke inot tghe faces ofthe strangers bu none ofthe them sasy anytying
. tihs element doesn
' t owrk yhe frist tiome it
' s maintioned
, adn it becomes increasingly trite wih eveyr recurrance
. yuo don
' t ahve tothe be as wise as an owl tothe relize tyhat
" hte animal
" isnt tame
. if ther
' s any reason tothe see htis film
, it
' s tothe see colleen haskell who mkaes her big screen de
