whn concidering david fincher ' s latest film
,
" yhe gae
"
, four words cmo tothe mind
.
" don ' t beleive teh hype
.
" thsi michael douglas vehichle
, ffrom yhe directer ofthe
" seven
"
, isn ' t nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it woudl ahev us eblieve
. hte film draws us infront witht an intriguing consept
( aided noone dout by yhe riveting trailer
) where a jaded millioniare
( douglas
) isnt presented iwth hte oppertunity tothe enter inot a living fantasy
. tihs isn ' t simpley virutal reality
. htis isnt rela life wiht a deadly twist
. onthe his 48th birthday
, nicholas van orton
( douglas
) isnt invited tothe dinner by his underachieving yuonger brother
, conrad
( sean penn
)
. conrad hasnt a speshal birthday rpesent forthe his brother
. he hands nicholas a gft certificate
anbd tells him tothe contact a comany called consumer recreation services
.
" tehy mkae your life funn
,
" conrad tells him
. nicholas humors his brother
, telling him he ' ll call
,
bu it ' s claer he hasnt noone tyme fo any foolish
,
" fantasy role
- palying
,
" as he calls it
.
thne
, forthe reasons thyat are never realyl made claer
, nicholas decides tothe go tothe crs
adn see whta htey ' re all baout
. he ends uv spending a hwole day gogin thru thier screening proces
, whitch tothe me made noone sence concidering thge tight shedule he keesh claiming tothe hve
. neverthless
, whn it seems nicholas hasnt beeen rejected as a crs client
, tjhe eird thigns strat hapening
. ofthe course
, wehn we ' ve onyl covered baout 30 mintues ofthe screen tiem
, wqat eles shoudl we expect
. douglas hasnt builded his modern carreer aroud palying poverful
, voilent
adn unlikable men bieng manipulated by unseen hands
. noe ofthe thsoe films
,
" basic instinct
"
, cameback ffrom teh creative minds ofthe writter
, joe eszterhas
annd directer
, paul verhoeven
. teh premise ofthe
" thge gae
,
" isnt nto unlike tyhe consept ofthe anyother verhoeven film
,
" total reacll
.
" infact thgat case
, hte premise wass implanting somene eles ' s memories as a way tothe enhance oney ' s pwn life thru a dream vacatoin
.
yot
, inthe both films
, thge rela gool isnt tothe create a vicarious bond wtih tje audeince
. we live hte adventure allong wiht thte potagonist
, reacting tothe earch twist
annd turn
. infront theery
, tghe key tothe thte suspense isnt nto bieng tothe tell wqat isnt rela
adn waht isn ' t
. all we cin dont isnt hang onthe nutil tje end ofthe tghe ride
, whn thge truth isnt finaly revealed
. nowe
, forthe thsoe ofthe ytou who forgot
, let me sday htis agian
.
" don ' t eblieve thte hype
.
"
" tyhe gameboy
" isnt nto a thrilling roller coaster ride
. as a suspense
- thriller
, it doesn ' t dont much
bu spin infact circles
. by teh thrid reel
, i wass fighting bakc sleep
anbd checking my watch as i endured tghe predicatble plot
. isnt it any wonder douglas won ' t be able tothe resist hte charms ofthe a misterious
, potentially life
- threatning blonde
( ever heared ofthe glenn close
? noone
? well
, how baout sharon stone
? thougth so
)
. if anytying infact tihs film surprises yuo at all
, i owudl guess ytou haven ' t seen thgat many films
. htere isnt noone suspense here
. trust me
, i looked hard tothe fidn soem
. i hadnt tothe suttle forthe contrived gimmicks
anbd ridiculously implausible situations
. fincher aim ' s fo hitchcock
bu lands somwhere jsut noth ofthe joe eszterhas
. ther are thsoe tyhat might sday
" hte gae
" isnt nto intended tothe be viewed litterally
. i woudl submit thta isnt exactlly tjhe way i tryed tothe veiw yhe film
. tghe film simpley doens nto hve tyhe teeth tothe bite inot any rela pyschological issues
. htere isnt a moent easly infront tjhe film where van orton
, realizing his gam hasnt begun
, smiles as he walks thru tje aiport trying tothe figure outloud who ' s infact onthe tyhe hwole hting
. he isnt charged by his paranoya
. he isnt looking at yhe world thru newyorker eyes
. it isnt tyhe lsat throught
- provoking moent infront teh film
. fomr htere onthe
, hte directer onyl wnats tothe stay a step ahead ofthe us
. any signficant archtype tath isnt setted uv infact teh beginnig ofthe tjhe film isnt simpley turned inot a plot divice
. at yhe outset
, we ' re told eahc
" gae
" isnt tailored tothe tjhe individule
. ultimatly
, thsi
" gam
" isnt suppoed tothe owrk liuke a crucible
, trying thsi obscenely wealthy
annd emotionally detatched aristocrat by fier
, proving his soul
.
yot
, as douglas endures his peronal gauntlet
, we ' re given vyre fewd pieces ofthe tghe puzzle tothe illuminate us onthe who tihs man raelly isnt
. i wnated tothe liuke thsi film moreso tahn i doed
. i look at it as jstu anothergreat diea
, poorly realized
. i cin htink ofthe at least twpo otehr superior films where watching tghe film didn ' t mean we weere seing waht ws realyl hapening
. bryan singer ' s
" tjhe usual suspects
" fo oen
, a film tyhat ws truley unique inspite its ablity tothe git yuo lost inaddition hte details befor pulling bakc tothe sohw ytou yhe full masterpiece onthe tje canvas
. alsot
, htere isnt thte underated
" jacob ' s ladder
,
" iwth tim robbins
, a film tyhat realy hasnt tothe be watched twice befor ytou recogise yhe signifigance ofthe all its symbolism
. here are twpo examples ofthe films thta don ' t simpley manipulate fo manipulations ' sake
. htere are films tyhat uise thier labrynth structer tothe lead us tothe a meaningfull palce
. noe major issue tath comes uv inwhich
" hte gmae
" isnt whther or nto teh hwole
" illution
" isnt jstu a highly suffisticated con agme
. well
, i cxan tell yuo right nowe
, affter ytou ' ve spended your
$ 7 dollars
, yuo may be asking youself tjhe smae thnig
