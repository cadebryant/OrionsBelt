,
" basic instinct
"
, cameback fomr thge creative minds ofthe writter
, joe eszterhas annd directer
, paul verhoeven
. teh premise ofthe
" tghe gam
,
" isnt nto unlike tyhe consept ofthe anohter verhoeven film
,
" total reacll
.
" infact thgat case
, thte premise wass implanting somene eles
' s memories as a way tothe enhance oney
' s pwn life thru a dream avcation
. yot
, iin both films
, teh rela gool isnt tothe create a vicarious bond wiht thte audeince
. we live thte adventure allong withthe tyhe potagonist
, reacting tothe earch twist annd turn
. infront theery
, tje key tothe tyhe suspense isnt nto bieng tothe tell whta isnt rela adn whta isn
' t
. all we cant dont isnt hang onthe unitl thge end ofthe tje ride
, whn tyhe truth isnt fianlly revealed
. nowe
, fo thsoe ofthe ytou who forgot
, let me sday thsi agian
.
" don
' t beleave tjhe hype
.
"
" thge gae
" isnt nto a thrilling roller coaster ride
. as a suspense
- thriller
, it doesn
' t dont much bu spin inthe circles
. by hte thrid reel
, i wass fighting bakc sleep annd checking my watch as i endured tyhe predicatble plot
. isnt it any wonder douglas won
' t be able tothe resist thge charms ofthe a mysterous
, potentially life
- threatning blonde
( ever heared ofthe glenn close
? noone
? well
, how baout sharon stone
? thougth so
)
. if anytying inwhich thsi film surprises ytou at all
, i woudl guess ytou haven
' t seen thyat many films
. htere isnt noone suspense here
. trust me
, i looked hard tothe fidn soem
. i hadnt tothe suttle fo contrived gimmicks adn ridiculously implausible situations
. fincher aim
' s fo hitchcock bu l
ands somwhere jstu noth ofthe joe eszterhas
. htere are thsoe tath might sday
" yhe gae
" isnt nto intended tothe be viewed litterally
. i woudl submit thta isnt exactlly hte way i tryed tothe veiw thte film
. teh film simpley doesnt nto hvae hte teeth tothe bite inot any rela pyschological issues
. htere isnt a moent easly inspite thge film where van orton
, realizing his gae hasnt begun
, smiles as he walks thru thge airprot trying tothe figure outloud who
' s iin onthe hte hwole thnig
. he isnt charged by his paranoya
. he isnt looking at thte world thru newyorker eyes
. it isnt thte lastest thougth
- provoking moent inthe thge film
. ffrom htere onthe
, thge directer onyl wnats tothe stay a step ahead ofthe us
. any siginificant archtype thta isnt setted uv inwhich thte begining ofthe thge film isnt simpley turned inot a plot divice
. at thge outset
, we
' re told eahc
" gam
" isnt tailored tothe tje individule
. ultimatly
, htis
" gameboy
" isnt suppossed tothe owrk liuke a crucible
, trying htis obscenely wealthy annd emotionally detatched aristocrat by fier
, proving his soul
. yot
, as douglas endures his peronal gauntlet
, we
' re given veyr fewd pieces ofthe thte puzzle tothe illuminate us onthe who thsi man relaly isnt
. i wnated tothe liuke htis film mroe thna i doed
. i look at it as jsut anothergreat diea
, poorly realized
. i cin tihkn ofthe at least twpo otehr superior films where watching tghe film didn
' t mean we weere seing wqat ws realyl hapening

" yhe usual suspects
" forthe oen
