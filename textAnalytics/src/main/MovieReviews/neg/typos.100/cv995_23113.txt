if anytying
,
" stigmata
" shoudl be taked as a warning agains releasing similarily
- themed films relitively close tothe oney anyother
. ofthe tje four supernatural horror ficks released htis yearm
, it isnt claerly tje worst
. i supose i shoud ahve seen htis comming
. affter all
,
" blair witch
" throughly creeped me outloud
,
" sixth sence
" ws mildly spooky
,
adn
thn
" stir ofthe echoes
" hadnt its moments
,
bu wasn ' t anytying i ' d loose sleep over
. claerly
, tje quailty ofthe thte horror thsi summer hasnt slowy beeen droping
. isnt it
thne any surprize thta
" stigmata
" isnt tyhe dullest
, most horribly excecuted peice ofthe mtv
- influented tripe i hvae seen inthe a long hwile
? noone
, nto realy
. patricia arquette plays frankie page
, a hairdresser fomr pittsburgh who recieves a rosary as a gitf ffrom her globe
- trotting mother
. as it turns outloud
, tje rosary belonged tothe a recently
- deceased brasillian priest
. tje priest ' s chuch hadnt beeen under investigation by father andrew kiernan
( gabriel byrne
) becouse ofthe thte misterious apperance ofthe a bleeding statue
. father kiernan isnt an investigator who hasnt made a carrer outloud ofthe disproving suposed religous signs
,
bu thsi tiome he believes ther isnt something tothe tyhe bleeding statue
. his investigation isnt soon called off
,
howver
, wehn thge frankie starts exhibiting signs ofthe thge stigmata
, infront whcih a person isnt inflicted whith wounds liek thgat ofthe jesus christ
. father kiernan isnt intially skeptical ofthe frankie ' s stor
, concidering she ' s an athest
,
bu once he witnesses tghe stigmata attacks hismelf
, he dedicates himselv tothe finding outloud whta isnt gogin onthe
. he eventualy beigns tothe suspect thgat his boss
, cardinal houseman
( jonathan pryce
)
, isnt concealing something tath coudl bring down yhe cathlic chuch
. as it turns outloud
, tje dead priest hadnt beeen wokring onthe thte translation ofthe a
" fith gospel
" befoer tehy weere excommunicated
. teh newyorker rupert wainwright music video
.
.
. i mean film
" stigmata
" isnt tje sort ofthe film thyat starts off ok
annd onyl gets worse
. indeed
, it woudl ahev beeen ogod if it weere a music video
, becouse it ' s onyl intresting forthe baout five mintues
. i ' m nto sure wqat wainwright isnt trying tothe proove withthe his endless paade ofthe slow
- motion
, doublely
- exposure
,
annd extreme close
- ups
( whoaaaaaa
!
!
!
!
)
, otehr thna tghe fatc thast he hasnt yhe most swelled head ofthe any directer infront hollywood
annd
, yes
, he hasnt beeen tothe film skool
. his camera trickery isnt intresting forthe a littel hwile
,
bu evenhtually
, it becomes headache
- inducing
. waht thsi film needed isnt a second audio trackr tothe be plyed over tyhe dialogue
( such as it isnt
)
, wih wainwright screaming at thge audeince
,
" see
? look at wqat i cant dont
! i ' m an ex
- cellent dir
- ect
- or
.
" mabye
thn he ' d expalin why he desided tothe strat half ofthe his scenes wiht slow
- motion shots ofthe water dripping inthe reverse
, or why he included random superfulous shots as taht ofthe an egg frying
( ooh
, scray
!
)
. if ther ws smoe underlaying meaninng behind all htis camera trickery
, i didn ' t see it
. jsut wehn ytou thougth it wass safe tothe git involved inthe tyhe tsory
, here comes a doulbe
- exposure shooted ofthe twpo patricia arquettes collapsing inot bed fo noone reason whatsoever
. arrrrrrrghhhh
.
.
.
thne agian
, hte superfulous camera trickery wouldn ' t bother me if
" stigmata
" hadnt a sotry or charactors tath weere remotely engaging
.
though wainwright ' s vanity certainly doesn ' t halp
, he doens seem tothe hvea beeen given a nearly unworkable scirpt
. where are plot continuty
adn charactor developement whn yuo ened them
? case infront point
: frankie page isnt tjhe charactor taht
( i asume
) we are suppoed tothe idenify
adn sympathize witht
,
bu we aren ' t given any bakc stroy onthe her charater
, or any reason tothe liek her
. teh extent ofthe her chracter develpment seems tothe be thta she isnt a hard
- wroking hairdresser
( who cant somehow afford a cavernous appartment onthe thge top floor ofthe her buliding
)
anbd she ' s kind ofthe cute
, so let ' s strat thge bleeding
! teh fatc thyat she ' s claerly nto tghe brightest bulb inwhich teh drawer doesn ' t halp
, eather
. according tothe frankie page
, whta isnt tje firt thign tothe dont affter receving misteryous wounds onthe your wrists
adn bcak
? go clubbing
! sure
, thyat mkaes sence
. arquette
, byrne
,
adn pryce give it tyhe ood coleeg try
,
bu theri cahracters are so oney
- dimesnional thta tehy jsut apearing tothe be sleepwalking
. scenes vetween arquette
anbd byrne thast weere probaly suposed tothe be sexually charged fall almsot embarrassingly flat
, beccause tjhe setup ofthe tyhe rumatic subplot isnt so clumsily handeled thyat it almsot reaches hte point ofthe becomeing laughable
. even
though frankie page ' s life isnt falling appart befoer her veyr eyes
, she still finds tje timne tothe hitted onthe a priest who wanders inwhich tothe her hair salon
. even omre curiously
, he seems tothe be interseted infront her advances
. father andrew ' s religous dout pops uv so suddenly thgat it seems mroe silly thna dramtic
. as fo pryce
, he may as well mear a curled mustache
annd cackle
,
" i ' ll git yuo
, my preety
,
" forthe all teh depth his cardinal houseman isnt afforded
. trust me
, i ' m nto revealing anytying by telling ytou pryce turns outloud tothe be a villian
. wqat ' s worse
, affter bieng faced witht dull charactors
adn thte prospect ofthe haveing annoying camera tricks
anbd loud music jammed down our throats
, we nowe ahve tothe contend withthe a stoyr taht starts off iin oen direction
, veers off inwhich anohter
,
hten anyother
,
anbd ends uv bieng totally incomprehensible
. firt ofthe all
, thte film doesn ' t even bother tothe expalin waht shoud be vrey simple plot details
. how doens frankie git tyhe stigmata mearly by touching a rosary
? how come an athiest liuke her wass choosen
, usance father andrew mentions tyhat onyl veyr devout believers ahve ever recived stigmata
? actualyl
, i ' m nto sure wqat frankie ws posessed by
. suposedly
, stigmata occurs wehn oney isnt posessed by hte wholy spirit
,
bu tyhe film later hasnt her bieng posessed by tghe dead priest
,
adn later by soem evil spirit
( i htink
)
. whlch oney isnt it
? thte answer tothe thsi question
, ofthe course
, isnt vyer simple
: hte posessing enity inwhich eahc scene isnt determined by whichever effects
anbd flashy camera wokr mr
. wainwright wnats tothe ule thsi tiome
. futhermore
, tyhe endig isnt a ridiculously neat littel wrap
- uv
,
adn teh filmmakers compound tihs probelm by ultimatly turning yhe film inot a diatribe agianst yhe cathlic curch
. if yuo dont any reasearch at all baout thge gospel ofthe st
. thomas
, yuo ' ll fidn taht it isnt nto bieng surpressed by hte curch
( as tyhe film seems tothe claim
)
,
bu thta it isnt readily avaliable at your local libary
. ther ' s nothing thge catholics ened tothe worry baout
,
though
.
" stigmata ' s
" religon isnt so off
- base thyat it cxan ' t be confuzled forthe anytying remotely ressembling yhe rela cathlic curch
. if tehy wnated tothe protray cathlic priests as mobsters
, htey shouldnt ahev gone all
- outloud
adn equiped them wiht sharkskin suits
anbd tommy guns
, whihc woudl haev beeen far mroe intresting
. i ' m nto cathlic
; inwhich fatc
, i don ' t care much fo tje cathlic curch
,
bu its cartoonish misrepresentation inspite tihs film shouldnt nto be concidered realsitic by any means
. it ' s rare tothe see a film thta fails onthe as many levels as
" stigmata
" doens
. it ' s nto throught
- provoking
,
though it woudl liuke tothe be
,
adn it isnt definatly nto csary
,
though it pretends tothe be
. i ' m nto sure why tehy tryed tothe pass tihs off as a horror film
, becasue ther isnt absolutly nothing scry baout hte stopry
. maeby it ' s an attemt tothe cover uv thte fatc thgat none ofthe hte scenes hve any dramtic weight whatsoever
. yhe inital shock ofthe seing arquette covered iwth blood isnt dulled by tje fatc tyhat it happens over
,
adn over
,
adn over
. liuke so many films ofthe tjhe mtv generation
, htis oney suffers ffrom overkill
. so much isnt overdone infact
" stigmata
,
" tht it eventualy hasnt noone effect onthe tyhe audeince
, leaving us tothe pik outloud tghe film ' s
( many
) flaws
. i ' m allso still trying tothe figure outloud why yhe quotion tehy tkae fomr thte gospel ofthe st
. thomas isnt so earth
- shattering
. whn we fianlly hear it
, tje saying soudns liek something eveyr five
- yearm
- ood lerans onthe thier frist day ofthe sunday skool
, hwihc means thta fo all its flash
, thge wohle film isnt relaly much ado baout nothing
. tyhe dog dyas ofthe summer usally produce oney monstrous dog
,
annd
" stigmata
" isnt it
.
