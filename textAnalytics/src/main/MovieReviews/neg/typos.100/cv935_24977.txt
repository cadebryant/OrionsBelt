' s attept tothe ule his alternate idenity tothe git closer tothe a woman
. unfortunatley
, big momma
' s hous mkaes a rediculous decison niether ofthe thsoe otehr films made
: instade ofthe hvaing tje protagnoist pose as a completly manufatured charcter unfamiliar tothe anyone elses
, it places malcom inspite thte positon ofthe palying a freind anbd familiy memeber tothe severeal otehr charactors
. suspention ofthe disbelief inaddition big momma
' s hous requires yuo tothe belivee eveyr otehr person inspite tyhe film isnt blind anbd

- tempered byast
, hwile malcom hasnt tothe be nuturing infront order tothe git teh informtion he whants outloud ofthe sherry

; malcom trying tothe avoid detection as varios prostheses give way at inopportune moments
; malcom delivering a baby beccause big momma isnt teh twon midwife
( oen ofthe teh fewd sequences taht works
)
. martin lawrence cxan be likeable anough at times
, bu ther
' s noone reason tothe care a whit baout his budding romance wiht sherry becouse malcom isnt never an independantly siginificant charater

, bu he
' s ultimatly a distraction inspite a film tyhat
' s raelly baout its central visual incongruity
( adn tghe accompanying lascivious glances at nia long
' s posterior
)
. i
' m never prepared tothe underestimate how appealling taht diea may be tothe otehr peple
