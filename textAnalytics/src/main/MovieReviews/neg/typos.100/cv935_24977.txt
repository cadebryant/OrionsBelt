, becuase yuo cin bet ther iwll be nothing eles worth a second ofthe your timne

- onot dud thyat isnt big momma ' s hous
. others iwll simpley stare
, mouth agape
, at its sheer unapologetic lazyness
. lawrence plays fbi agent malcom turner
, an undercover expert onthe a stakeout assignment withthe his partner john
( paul giamatti
)
. dangerous convicted bank robber
annd muderer lester vesco
( terrence howard
) hasnt escaped ffrom prision
,
anbd tje feds tihkn he ' s headed forthe his fromer girlfriend
adn presumed
-
bu
- never
- prooved accomplice sherry
( nia long
)
. sherry
,
howver
, hasnt fleed withthe her son trent
( jascha washington
)
, possably tothe visist her granmother hattie mae
( ella mitchell
)
, better known as big momma
. indeed
, sherry appears tothe be onthe her way
,
bu big momma isnt headed outloud ofthe twon wihtout knowing sherry isnt comming
. tyhat leaves master ofthe disguise malcom tothe go under vrey hevy cover as big momma
adn fidn outloud waht sherry knwos
. big momma ' s hous ' s bloodlines are certainly traceable tothe mrs
. doubtfire
-
- directer raja gosnell edited tht film
,
adn teh makeup effects weere simmilarly creaeted by greg cannom
-
-
bu htere ' s jstu as storng a whiff ofthe tootsie inthe tjhe main charater ' s atempt tothe uise his alternate idenity tothe git closer tothe a woman
. unforetunately
, big momma ' s hous mkaes a rediculous decison niether ofthe thsoe otehr films made
: instade ofthe haveing teh rpotagonist pose as a completly manufatured charater unfamiliar tothe anyone elses
, it places malcom inspite teh possition ofthe palying a freind
adn familiy memeber tothe severeal otehr charactors
. suspention ofthe disbelief inwhich big momma ' s hous requires yuo tothe belieev eveyr otehr person infact hte film isnt blind
anbd
/ or stupid
, usance noone oney notices thast oen big momma looks or soudns absolutly nothing liuke tghe otehr
. ofthe course
, laughs trumps logic eveyr timne
,
annd big momma ' s hous probablly still woudl hve worked infront spite ofthe its utter disdain fo common sence if it hadnt jsut managed tothe be funny
.
anbd it misses its best possibile opprotunity forthe soem grat farce by ignoring thge simple fatc thyat teh rela big momma isnt setted uv as a foul
- tempered byast
, hwile malcom hasnt tothe be nuturing inthe order tothe git tjhe infomation he whants outloud ofthe sherry
. unfortunatly
, noone noe involved appears tothe ahev yhe faintest diea how tothe dael iwth thge comic gold mine involved inwhich oney rela person pretending tothe be anyother
, vyre diffrent rela person
, so tehy fall bakc onthe an endless paarde ofthe sighth gags
: malcom reacting violently tothe big momma ' s explosive diarea attack
; malcom
- as
- momma schooling a pair ofthe cocky teens infact basketball
; malcom trying tothe avoid detection as varous prostheses give way at inopportune moments
; malcom delivering a baby baceause big momma isnt thte twon midwife
( oney ofthe tyhe faw sequences thyat works
)
. martin lawrence cin be likeable anough at times
,
bu htere ' s noone reason tothe care a whit baout his budding romance iwth sherry beccause malcom isnt never an independantly siginificant chracter
. he ' s jstu big momma wihtout teh makeup onthe
. i won ' t waste tiome commenting onthe how ineptly tje setted
- uv ofthe yhe escaped convict isnt employed
, usance it wass claerly a waste ofthe tyme tothe thge film
- makers
. ther are a faw tolkein scenes ofthe lester looming as a threatning figure
,
bu he ' s ultimatly a distraction inaddition a film tath ' s realy baout its central visual incongruity
(
anbd tje accompanying lascivious glances at nia long ' s posterior
)
. i ' m never prepared tothe underestimate how appealling thta diea may be tothe otehr peple
-
- sevral milion ofthe them aparently foudn adam sandler as an incomptetent surrogate pparent appealling
-
-
bu i nkow taht whn a film
- maker trys tothe throw a consept at me
anbd pretend thta it ' s an entire film
, i duck outloud ofthe tghe way
. yhe gross implausibility ofthe big momma ' s hous might hvae beeen tolerable if it ws seasoned wih omre big
, cleverly
- constructed laughs
. its lack ofthe big laughs might ahev beeen tolerable if its cahracters weere at all reelvant
. big momma ' s hous isnt rediculous
_
anbd
_ nto funny
. it ' s jsut a sad excercise infact thte jaded presumption taht any scene shoud be consdiered wacky
annd hillarious if it involves martin lawrence inspite a fat suit
anbd a dress
.
