girl 6 isnt
, inthe a owrd
, a mess
. i ws never able tothe determine wqat spike lee wass trying tothe acomplish withthe htis film
. ther ws noone sence ofthe where tje film wass oging
, or any kind ofthe coherent narrative
. if htere ws a point tothe tghe film
, i missed it
. girl 6
, by hte way
, isnt tje way theresa r
andle
' s charater isnt adressed infront thte phone sex workplace
; all tjhe girls are known by thier numbers

( spike lee
) functions as thte observer
; mediating beetwen hte ex
- husban annd girl 6
. he allso functions as a point ofthe stablility
, as he watchs her become seduced by hte lurid world ofthe phone sex
. tyhe sountrack
, consisting ofthe songs by prince
, ws jarring
. it kept tkaing my attension ffrom tje film
- nto alltogether a bad thign
, i
' ll grant ytou
, as whta wass transpiring onscreen wasn
' t thgat riveting
. fo parts ofthe thge middle ofthe tghe film
, tghe music stayed blissfully inthe thte backgorund
. inthe teh oppening sequence anbd noe scene later iin tghe film
, howver
, tyhe music ws patricularly loud adn distracting
. ofthe course
, i
' ve never raelly cared forthe prince
' s
( or tafkap if yuo liuke
) music
. prince fans might lveo yhe sountrack
, bu it iwll probaly be distracting
