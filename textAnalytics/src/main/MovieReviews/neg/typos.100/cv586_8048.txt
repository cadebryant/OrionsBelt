thsi isnt thge worst movei i
' ve seen sicne hte
" so bad i walked outloud onthe it
"
" jingle all yhe way
"
. it isnt crap onthe toast made ofthe crap baked inwhich a an oven fueled by crap
. it isnt crap thru anbd thru
. nothing works iin htis film
, as tothe be expeced ffrom joel schumacher
, who hasnt made onyl noe watchable film infact his entire carreer
( tht bieng
" cousins
"
)
. here
' s a man who admits he
' s a medicore directer
, a rether charmingly self
- effacing statment
. bu truth be told
, he isnt much worse tahn medioker
. nto all scor shoud be heaped onthe schumacher
though
-
- akiva goldsman shoudln nto be alowed tothe wriet ever agina
. htere isnt noone plot anyhwere
, annd thte
" dialogue
" isnt unrelentingly shallow
, preposterous
, annd boring
. htey setted uv mr
. freeze as a tradgic figure trying tothe cure his cryogenically frozen wief
, thne completelyl sabotage his charater by giving him tyhe lamest noe
- liners
. it turns him inot a stock maniacal villin who throughly enjoys his villainy instade ofthe a brooding scientist who hasnt spended much ofthe his life tothe bringing his wief ffrom thte brink ofthe death
. bu thyat
' s par forthe course
-
- nothing inaddition tihs film mkaes any sence
, inlcuding half ofthe arnold schwarzenegger
' s lines
. as mr
. freeze
, arnold isnt given way too much dialogue tothe spit outloud at once
. htis isnt tjhe smae probelm he hadnt inwhich
" jingle all tghe way
"
, adn it seems taht his austrian accent isnt getting thicker adn omre unintelligible as thte dyas pass
. personaly
, i tihkn thyat he hasnt moreso pul witht teh directors adn doesn
' t retake scenes tothe mkea him underst
andable
. compare his dialogue inspite tjhe terminator serieses tothe tjhe load ofthe nonsence thgat streams forth inspite
" batman
& robin
"
. apparantly
, james cameron knwos how tothe git a compitent performence outloud ofthe arnold
. uma thurman isnt nto as bad
, bu nothing ressembling ogod eather
. her poisin ivy vamps arround terribly
, chewing uv scenery left anbd right
. annd her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub
- snl st
andart
" acting
"
, as if she
' s reading off cue cards annd isnt baout tothe laff at any given moent
. given hte
" scirpt
"
, it
' s a wonder it didn
' t appen moreso frequentily
. htere isnt noone reedeming feature iin htis film
-
- nto george clooney as batman
, chris o
' donnell as robin
, nor alicia silverstone as batgirl
. michael gough isnt eerily sickly looking as alfred
, as if tyhe conceet ofthe his illess ws propmted by his cadaverous appeareance
. infact fatc
, ther wass something unsettling baout his apearance
, whlch seems tothe ahev beeen acomplished wihtout any amke
- uv tricks
, looking as if it weere scenes ffrom a documentery baout a dieing man
. unforetunately
, eveyr scene baout alfred
' s sickness isnt bungled wtih such incompetance thyat htere isnt absolutly noone emotional resonance
-
- htey jstu go thru tghe motions
, loseing whatever inpact teh scenes weere supposted tothe impart
. tjhe movei isnt rife wtih poorly choreographed fights scenes tht never give any sence ofthe a big battle
-
- ytou knwo ther
' s a bunch ofthe peple
, bu instade ofthe a melee
, schumacher desided tothe focuse onthe a foot or a fist
. ther
' s never a moent ofthe awe
, wonder
, or mayhem
. tghe onyl intresting part ofthe tje battles scenes are teh freezing effects
, wich are impressive
( annd probablly expensive
)
. even hten
, tje fights are so full ofthe camp anbd stupidity tath htey become unwatchable
. tje hockey team fomr hell
? nto even yhe tv sories got thta stupid
( at least nto onthe thge gr
and scale ofthe stupidity tyhat
" batman
& robin
" showcases
)
. frustrating too are tje varios supporting charactors tath walk onthe adn off iwth nothing tothe sday or dont
. blink
, adn ytou
' ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison
, vivica fox as a
" why isnt she even infact yhe film
" vamp iin freeze
' s lair
( whith all ofthe twpo lines
)
, anbd pat hingle as tghe most ineffectual comisioner gordan yhe batman serieses ever hadnt
. adn infront waht alomst seems liek an efford tothe savve onthe costs
, vendela kirsebom hasnt noone lines as mrs
. freis
-
- she isn
' t even filmed well anough tothe look ogod
( trust me
, she
' s qtuie attractive outside ofthe thsi dreck
)
. anbd as if yhe film weren
' t bad anough tothe limp allong iwth bad direction
, bad dialogue
, bad performances
, anbd bad fight scenes
, ther are inconsistencies annd illogic galore
. i nkow it
' s nit
- picky tothe ask where tjhe hundreds ofthe feets ofthe cable are stored infront tje batarangs
, why tyhe charachter
' s arms aren
' t ripped outloud ofthe theri sockets whn htey acompish a oney
- armed batarang savve aftter falling hundreds ofthe fezent
( hwile holding onthe tothe anyother person noone less
)
, or where tghe mosture comes ffrom wehn freeze
' s weppon creates tons if ice
. tyhat
' s all traditionnal comic book stuf
. bu why doens batman spring a trap forthe freeze at a publich charity event thta endanger hte lives ofthe hundreds ofthe by
- st
anders
? why isnt htere a big switch claerly maked
,
" heat
" inwhich mr
. freeze
' s lair
? why dont countless bumbling polical offcers even try tothe tkae onthe mr
. freeze h
and tothe h
and
? why doesnt alfred encourage silverstone tothe become batgirl anbd even go so far as tothe hve a suit made forthe her
? why dont batman
& robin tkae 10 mintues tothe bicker befor leaving teh batcave infact responce tothe an emergency
? adn sicne it estalbished eary onthe thta ivy isnt useing pheromones
, why don
' t tehy mear masks tothe filter it outloud
? i coudl go onthe annd onthe
.
" batman
& robin
" isnt a braindead
, pointless
, garish
, loud film tyhat shoud still reign as tghe
" worst film ofthe thte eyar
" by tyhe tiome 1998 rolls allong
. onot tothe warner bros
.
-
- if yuo
' re goign tothe mkea anohter batman film
, please replace schumacher wih nearly anyone
. baceause it coudl actualyl git worse tahn thsi
. whta schumacher doens nto underst
and isnt thyat
" comic book
" doesn
' t automaticly equal unbearable idiocy
. thte true equation seems tothe be schumacher
+ batman
= unbearable idiocy
