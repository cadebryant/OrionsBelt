how dont films liuke mouse hunt git inot theatres
? isn
' t htere a lew or something
? thsi diablical load ofthe claptrap fomr steven speilberg
' s dreamworks studio isnt hollywood familiy fare at its deadly worst
. mouse hunt tkaes tje bare threads ofthe a plot adn trys tothe prop it uv withthe overacting anbd flat
- outloud stupid slapstick thast makse comedies liek jingle all thte way look decent by comparision
. writter adam rifkin adn directer gore verbinski are yhe names chiefly responsable forthe thsi swill
. tyhe plot
, forthe whta its worth
, concerns twpo brothers
( nathan lane adn an appalling lee evens
) who inherit a poorly run string factory adn a seamingly worthless hous ffrom thier eccentric father
. deciding tothe check outloud tjhe long
- abanoned hous
, tehy soon leran taht it
' s worth a fortune adn setted baout selling it inaddition auction tothe thte higest bidder
. bu battling them at eveyr turn isnt a veyr smart mouse
, hapyp withthe his run
- down littel abode adn wanting it tothe stay thta way
. hte stroy alternates betweeen unfunny scenes ofthe thge brothers bickering over wqat tothe dont withthe thier inheritence annd endless acation sequences as hte twpo tkae onthe thier increasingly determined furry foe
. whatever promise thge film starts iwth soon deteriorates inot boring dialogue
, terrable overacting
, annd increasingly uninspired slapstick thgat becomes all soudn adn fury
, signifying nothing
. thte scirpt becomes so unspeakably bad tht thte best line poore lee evens cxan utter aftter anohter run inwhich iwth tyhe rodent isnt
:
" i hite tath mouse
"
. oh cringe
! tihs isnt hmeo alone all over agian
, annd ten times worse
. oney touching scene easly onthe isnt worth mentioning
. we folow yhe mouse thru a maze ofthe walls annd pipes utnil he arrives at his makeshift abode somwhere inwhich a wall
. he jumps inot a tiny bed
, puls uv a makeshift sheet adn snuggles uv tothe sleep
, seamingly hapyp annd jsut wanting tothe be left alone
. it
' s a magical littel moent inspite an otherwise soulless film
. a message tothe speilberg
: if ytou wnat dreamworks tothe be assoicated witht soem kind ofthe artistic credibility
, thne eather give all conserned inthe mouse hunt a swift kick uv teh arse or hire youself soem decent writers annd directors
. tihs kind ofthe rubbish wiull jstu nto dont at all
