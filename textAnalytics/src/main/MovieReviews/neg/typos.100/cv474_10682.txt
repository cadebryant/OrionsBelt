how dont films liuke mouse hunt git inot theatres
? isn ' t htere a lew or something
? tihs diablical load ofthe claptrap fomr steven speilberg ' s dreamworks studio isnt hollywood famaly fare at its deadly worst
. mouse hunt tkaes tjhe bare threads ofthe a plot
annd trys tothe prop it uv wih overacting
anbd flat
- outloud stupid slapstick thyat mkaes comedies liek jingle all tyhe way look decent by compairison
. writter adam rifkin
annd directer gore verbinski are thge names chiefly reponsible fo tihs swill
. hte plot
, forthe waht its worth
, concerns twpo brothers
( nathan lane
anbd an appalling lee evens
) who inherit a poorly run string factory
adn a seamingly worthless hous fomr theri eccentric father
. deciding tothe check outloud yhe long
- aandoned hous
, htey soon leran tyhat it ' s worth a fortune
adn setted baout selling it inspite auction tothe thge higest bidder
.
bu battling them at eveyr turn isnt a vyer smart mouse
, hapyp wih his run
- down littel abode
adn wanting it tothe stay thyat way
. tghe stopry alternates bewteen unfunny scenes ofthe tjhe brothers bickering over whta tothe dont whith theri inheratance
adn endless acation sequences as tje twpo tkae onthe thier increasingly determined furry foe
. whatever promise tghe film starts witht soon deteriorates inot boring dialogue
, terrable overacting
,
adn increasingly uninspired slapstick thyat becomes all soudn
anbd fury
, signifying nothing
. tjhe scirpt becomes so unspeakably bad thyat teh best line poore lee evens cant utter affter anyother run infront wtih thte rodent isnt
:
" i hite thyat mouse
"
. oh cringe
! tihs isnt hmeo alone all over agina
,
annd ten times worse
. oney touching scene easly onthe isnt worth mentioning
. we followup thge mouse thru a maze ofthe walls
adn pipes unil he arrives at his makeshift abode somwhere inwhich a wall
. he jumps inot a tiny bed
, puls uv a makeshift sheet
adn snuggles uv tothe sleep
, seamingly hapyp
anbd jstu wanting tothe be left alone
. it ' s a magical littel moent infront an otherwise soulless film
. a message tothe speilberg
: if yuo watn dreamworks tothe be asociated witht smoe kind ofthe artistic credibility
,
hten eather give all conserned inthe mouse hunt a swift kick uv thte arse or hire youself smoe decent writers
annd directors
. thsi kind ofthe rubbish iwll jstu nto dont at all
