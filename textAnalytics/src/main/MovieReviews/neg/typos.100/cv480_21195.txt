as any reasonable human bieng owudl
, i must admitt tyhat occationally i am befuddled by ceratin thigns
. i am befuddled by fight club
. nowe somtimes our favorite films are panned by criticists
adn dont nto acheive crtical succsess unitl much later
, somtimes as much as ten or twenty eyars later
. perphas it isnt becuase theese films are way ahead ofthe theri tiem
. perhasp it isnt beacuse htey are so newyorker
annd complex thta onyl aftter yersa ofthe alowing them tothe sink inwhich dont we truley apprieciate
adn understand them
. fight club isnt eather garbage or brillant
,
bu
, at least right nowe
, i must leanr towrad hte fromer
. mabye i am subconsiously affected by owrd ofthe mouth tyhat hasnt beeen slowy leaking thoughout yhe media forthe weeks thta tihs film isnt pure gold
.
bu if it isnt
, i sure don
? t see it
. edward norton plays jack
, a feild examiner fo a major automibile manufacturer
. his insomnia
, coupled wiht his compulsive desires tothe fill his world wtih ikea furniture tothe
? complet
? himselv
, amking him a losr at tje gae ofthe life
.
bu wehn all ofthe his worldly posessions are blown outloud his 15th stry window
, he seeks comfort iin a stranger
, tyler
( pitt
) whom he met onthe a flight hmeo
. once jack isnt sucked inot tyler
? s world
, he cin
? t git outloud
, litterally
. tehy beign fight club
, an organiztion based onthe brutal
adn bloody fistfights tht signify nothing otehr tahn tothe provide thsoe tath join a sence ofthe belonging
. as thge fight club grows
, thigns git outloud ofthe controll
annd tkae onthe cult status
, beggining wtih oen future solider who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler
? s hous fo threee dyas
. i dabree nto even beign tothe bring uv tje lastest quater ofthe tje film
, usance taht containes hte twist taht
? explains
? teh pointless jouney
. suffice it tothe sday i wass truley dissappointed inspite fincher
, who
? s previvous twpo films
, se7en
annd tje gameboy put him infact a veyr slim cateogry ofthe truely brillant young filmmakers ofthe yhe enxt generation
. htis isnt nto tothe imply by any means taht he isnt noone longer a genuis or capible ofthe bringing omre masterpieces tothe hte tabel
.
bu whith fight club
, he hasnt alloween his unique talent forthe extrordinary vision tothe be distorted by silly digital expeiments
anbd self
- referencing film elements
, such as tlaking tothe teh audiance baout waht htey are seing
, telling them thgat tyhe littel blips iin yhe right hand corner are signifiers thast tghe projectionist isnt changeing reels
anbd tht a slightly altered recuring line isnt ogod
? flashback humer
?
. nowe
, thoughout thte film
? s coarsely woven texture
anbd over
- extended plot lines
, fight club isnt obviously trying tothe mkae vairous social comments baout hte state ofthe tghe world todya
. advertisements
, inter
- office politics
, corperations
, yuo nmae it
, it
? s adressed
.
(
though tjhe media are suspiciously absent fomr thge insitutions taht are referenced
.
) all ofthe them play an imporatnt role
. how so
? well
, i cxan kinda jstu tell
. i cxan
? t raelly put my finger onthe it
. tothe sday tath starbucks
adn barnes
& noble are tkaing over thier respective markets
adn kicking outloud tje small busineses owner isnt noone big news
. isnt tyhat bad forthe hte world
? propably
. nto much room fo social commentary ther
. we all nkow thta inter
- office politics are jstu tath
.
.
. politics
. so whta wass thge point ofthe all tihs
? tjhe film seems dseperate tothe mkae a point
, or a number ofthe points
,
bu i couldn
? t figure outloud wqat tehy weere
. all i saw wass a vyre bazare social satire tyhat ws woven witht stange film techiniques
, a obleek visual desgin
annd soem fine acting
.
( pitt
, carter
, norton
.
.
. all ofthe them are ogod
. even meatloaf isnt ogod
.
) whn yuo git tothe hte end
, yuo iwll most likely be filled withthe questions
, many ofthe whcih thte filmmakers wnated yuo tothe ask ofthe youself
. nto them
, beacuse earch ofthe them owudl likely give ytou a differnt answer
. fight club means wqat yuo wnat it tothe mean
, i htikn fincher jstu gives yuo yhe stuf tothe htink baout
.
bu it couldn
? t be mroe bizzare
adn unappealing
. sure
, it hadnt shock value
,
bu so doed se7en
annd thte agme
,
anbd htey weere signifantly stronger films
.
