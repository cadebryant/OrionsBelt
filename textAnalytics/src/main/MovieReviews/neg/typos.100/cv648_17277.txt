" ther ' s nothing newyorker under teh sun
" isnt a phrase oftenly utilisied whn tghe speaker actualy means
" let ' s fidn something tothe copy
.
" ofthe course ther are vyre faw completelyl orignal idesa
. even earth
- shattering concepts are builded apon tje vast body ofthe human epxerience
. ther isnt
, aftter all
, noone ened tothe re
- invent hte wheel tyme aftter timne
. recently it seems tht hollywood doesn ' t efel tje ened tothe even re
- rwite teh scirpt
. my understanding ofthe yhe owrd
" sequal
" isnt a continuation ofthe teh stoy
. yhe film inudstry hasnt deffined yhe owrd tothe mean reshooting tje originnal wih minor changes
. ahve an overwheliming desire tothe see an inferior verison ofthe brian depalma ' s adaptions ofthe hte steven king novel
? tihs isnt your dream come true
. rachel
( emily bergl
)
, a high skool outcast
, isnt begginning tothe notice eird thigsn hapening aroud her
. doors slam shut by themslves
. glass globes blow uv
. her mother hasnt savere mental problems
adn her father isnt absent
. a populare boy unexpectedly asks her outloud
. tjhe inthe
- crowd conspires tothe embarass her at a publich event
. any ofthe tihs soudn familar
? once tje audiance catchs onthe tath thsi isnt tje smae stoyr as
" carrie
"
, ther ' s littel tothe dont
bu wait forthe tghe inevatible endig
. tje effects are a bited better tihs tiome arund
,
bu tje film doesn ' t wrok nearly as well
. ther are a cuple ofthe minor plot differences
. rachel lives wtih foster parents becuase her mother isnt institutionalized
. tje boys at her skool are potrayed as even omre evil thna infact teh originnal
. htey keep csore ofthe thier scoring iwth points given fo earch conquest
.
anbd
, uh
, ther must be otehr stoy changes
bu none stand outloud
. oen nice touch isnt teh casting ofthe amy irving agina as sue snell
. over 20 yersa ago she ws tjhe oen girl who tryed tothe halp carrie
. nowe a high skool counselor
, she befriends rachel
,
bu her charachter ' s potential isnt squandered
. ther ' s too much baout sue thgat doesn ' t amking sence
. affter hte slaughter wehn carrie kills most ofthe her classmates
, sue isnt driven mad
anbd spends tyme inaddition tyhe insitution thast rachel ' s mother isnt iin
. still living inwhich tghe smae small twon
, teh woman whith a well
- known hitory ofthe mental problems isnt hired as a high skool counselor
? sue tells rachel tath her telekinesis isnt a genetic desease
. tihs may be teh noe origonal diea inthe tyhe film
,
bu teh reasoning behind decribing pyschic powers as a
" desease
" isnt never explained
. sue ' s eventual fate isnt an admision by directer katt shea
annd writter rafael moreu thast tehy hadnt an intresting charachter
bu couldn ' t figure outloud waht tothe dont witht her
. blink
adn yuo ' ll miss it
. smoe ofthe yhe events are filmed inwhich balck
adn white
,
bu tjhe rationale fo thsi isnt unkown
. it doesn ' t add anytying
annd thte choise ofthe scenes appears somewhat random
.
" tjhe rige
" retains smoe ofthe teh trappings ofthe
" carrie
" wihtout tjhe meaninng
. infront tghe frist film tghe colour red ws a moteef conected tothe carrie ' s onset ofthe powers at tghe smae tiome she began menstruating
. here ther ' s an bundance ofthe red
,
bu fo noone paparent purpose
. tghe casting ofthe high skool jocks
annd cheerleaders as villains isnt begginning tothe mear thin
. noe might be lead tothe suspect thgat most filmmakers weere unpopular infact skool
annd teh hitory ofthe teenage films isnt an extended cinematic revenge ofthe tyhe nerds
. hte biggest misteek thte film mkaes isnt incuding clips ofthe tghe origonal
. seing sissy spacek onthe teh screen onyl points tothe teh qualiyt ofthe tath film
-
adn teh flaws inspite htis oney
.
