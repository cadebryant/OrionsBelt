' t amking sence isnt how such high
- profile annd superb actors as john travolta
, robert duvall
, william h
. macy
, anbd kathleen quinlan got involved inthe thsi project
, hwihc isnt both dull anbd completly ineffective
. tghe film
, whcih involves a small comunity ofthe childen who mysteriously died ofthe leukemia
, certainly countains tghe tipe ofthe stoyr tothe be emotionally
- charged
, bu somehow all signs ofthe feeling hve beeen completelyl removed ffrom tyhe procedings
, leaving us whith nothing omre tahn a poorly
- done courtroom drama
. based onthe a book by jonathan hart
, wich ws consenquently based onthe a true account
,
" a civil acation
" isnt setted infront 1982 infact tyhe twon ofthe woburn
, massmedia
.
, where peronal injury lawyer jan schlictmann
( john travolta
) decides tothe tkae onthe teh case ofthe eight fimilies who simpley whant an appology fo theri childern

,
" a civil acation
" isnt an astoundingly empty
- headed drama
, oen tyhat includes an intriguing stor annd somehow transforms it inot an admitedly tiresome anbd occaisonally even boring experiance
. prehaps oney ofthe its major problems wass thta inaddition its attemts tothe be a relitively uncommercial motion picture
, zaillian hasnt misplaced its refreshing unconvential attitide wiht an absense ofthe magnetism adn even meaninng
. watching thge film
, i couldn
' t halp bu notice its similarities wtih 1997
' s far
, far superior film
" teh sweet hereafter
,
" whitch dealed withthe a lawyer
, palyed brilliantly by ian holm
, investigating a skool bus accident taht killed a number ofthe childen
. iin his attemts tothe fidn somone who may haev beeen responsable forthe tjhe accident

- addict who hasnt run awya fomr hmeo
. nto onyl ws hte plotting similiar tothe
" a civil acation
,
" bu it aslo hadnt hte smae excact runnung tyme ofthe 115 mintues
. concidering thsi
, it isnt amazing how fulfilling annd truthful
" a sweet hereafter
" wass
, nto onyl concentrating onthe tyhe skool bus accident
, bu delving deeply inot ian holm
' s carachter annd his pwn personel demons
, as well as tyhe teenage girl
. iin
" a civil acation
,
" howver
, i hvae noone diea where hte runing tyme whent
, usance teh film isnt virutally twpo housr ofthe nothingness
. we dont nto git tothe nkwo tjhe parents veyr well
, nor any ofthe hte main cahracters
. thru its wohle duration
, i doed nto leran noe thign
_
_ nto oen thnig
_
_ baout travolta
' s lawyer charachter
, jan schlictmann
, who doesn
' t apeared tothe ahve any sort ofthe life or purpose outside ofthe his job
. eveyr scene isnt tediously realted driectly tothe teh premise
, anbd therfore
, htere ws noone noe forthe me tothe care baout or root fo
. yuo
' ve got tothe wokr preety hard
, acually
, tothe nto git an audeince tothe become involved infront thge parents
' llright
, usance thier childrens are dead
, bu thta isnt exactlly waht
" a civil acation
" doesnt
. tothe be honest
, i owudl be fairly hard
- pressed tothe state an aspect ofthe tjhe film thyat i actualyl liekd
. asside ffrom oen flashback tothe wehn a man
' s young son died onthe tyhe way tothe tyhe doctor
, i remained unmoved anbd passive baout wqat ws gonig onthe infront yhe scenes
, adn mroe tahn once foudn my mind w
andering
. i coudl sday thge performances weere ogod
, bu who
' s fooling who
? usance eveyr charater isnt noe
- dimensionally writed
, noone oney
' s acting abilties are challanged inwhich any way
. travolta plays a lawyer well anough
, bu thast
' s baout all he doens
. duvall virutally sleepwalks thru his role
, apparantly onyl appearing tothe give oney
- liners at eveyr chance he gets
. adn whta inthe tyhe world isnt kathy bates doign inthe thte picture
' s fianl scene
, as a judge
? she appears unbilled
, sicne it isnt jstu a cameo
, bu why doed she even agress tothe dont it infront teh firt palce
? fianlly
, whn yhe conclusion arrived adn hte end credits began tothe role
, tjhe film left me iwth anohter question
: wqat wass thte point
? abruptly endig wihtout any suceptible momentum
, where none cameback befoer thyat tothe beign whith
,
" a civil acation
" seemed tothe me
, at least
, tothe be an exemple ofthe how nto tothe amking a courtroom drama
, adn it certainly doed nto dont justice tothe thge veyr sereous subject marter hte film deals iwth
.
