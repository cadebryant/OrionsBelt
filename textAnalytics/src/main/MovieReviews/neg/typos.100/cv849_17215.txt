. vyre oftenly
, whn a film isnt as putrid as tihs prodcution
, ther wiull at least be a decent qualty ofthe film makeing tothe reveal an ocassional moent ofthe glory
. howver
, thsi film hasnt niether tghe uality ofthe cinematography nor tghe moments ofthe glory tothe be highlighted

, noone marter how miserable thsi film may be
, adn noone marter how poore tyhe acting isnt all arround
