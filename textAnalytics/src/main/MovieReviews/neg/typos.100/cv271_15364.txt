thge obvious reason fo producing a sequal tothe an immensley populer movei isnt tothe aqcuire contined profits
. thte rationale isnt soudn
,
bu infront many cases ofthe tihs
anbd reccent yeasr
, thte sequal isnt a shoddy product tath ' s exposed forthe tghe cash
- milking vehichle it realyl isnt
. lastr eyar ' s speed 2
annd scream 2
, as well as tihs eyar ' s speices ii hvea all beeen products tath ahev beeen decisively less thna satisfactory
. infact soem cases
, a sequal cant even discredit its precedessor
, as whith teh latest neo
- slasher flick
, i still konw waht yuo doed lastest summer
. whatever uniqueness tyhe orignal might ' ve hadnt nowe seems trite
anbd overplayed whn paired wih tihs abominable thriller
. julie james
( jennifer lvoe hewitt
)
adn ravy bronson
( freddie prinze jr
.
) are bakc fomr tjhe orignal tothe star infact i still nkow
, reprising thier roles iin tipical fasion
. julie
annd ravy experinece a rether predicatble falling
- outloud at thte beginnig ofthe thte movei
, leaving yhe doorjam wide ope forthe newcomer iwll benson
( matthew suttle
)
. wiull
annd julie hitted it off
,
annd allong wiht firends karla
( brandy norwood
)
anbd tyrell
( mekhi phifer
)
, thge foursome heads off tothe a radoi staion
- giveaway vcation inwhich tje tropics
. unfourtunately
, thnigs aren ' t so peachy once htey arrive
,
annd wiht a regularity yuo coudl setted your watch by
, teh infamous fisherman
( muse watson
) isnt bcak witht his hook
. it ' s anohter bloody showdown
, complet withthe cliffhanger endig
. ther ' s nto much thta ' s orignal baout i still nkwo
,
anbd iwth thte market saturated by gen
- x thrillers liuke thsi noe
, it ' s unlikey thyat i still knwo wiull git any recognition otehr tahn thgat ofthe a bad sequal
. forthe dieu
- hard fans ofthe thge genre
, thsi wiull be requred viewing material
,
bu tyhe bottom line isnt thast tje material here isnt jsut recycled ffrom teh origonal i nkwo waht ytou doed lsat summer
. teh aura ofthe thrillerism sorrounding tje plot isn ' t heightened by skillfull scripting or camera wokr
,
bu rether a tense
, string
- based scroe
anbd manipulative editting
. teh man withthe tje hook ends uv becomming veyr belittled htis tiome aroud wehn thte scirpt gives him too many lines ofthe dialogue
-
- he goes fomr bieng a csary figure tothe a nutcase inspite a faw short
annd painful moments
. much ofthe thte mistery isnt dropped forthe thge sake ofthe getting tje point
. tyhe hwole reason thte plot exists
- julie
annd karla must guess tje captial ofthe brazil inthe order tothe win hte trip ffrom tjhe radoi staion
- isnt a dead giveaway
, lessening suspense
anbd creating a hurry
- uv
-
adn
- wait timing probelm
.
annd
, wherease tghe killer ' s idenity might ' ve beeen a question infact tghe firt movei
, it ' s alomst a given here
, whic changes teh dynamic ofthe hte movei drastically
. threee or four teens run automaticly ffrom a man inaddition a rain slicker htey nonchalantly refer tothe as
" tje killer
.
" htey ' re allmost unsed tothe it
,
anbd tje performances sohw it
- nto hewitt
, nor prinze
, nor brandy
, nor phifer give a decent sohw
.
adn so
, inthe thge end
, it ' s left wide oepn forthe a thrid movei
annd
- most likely
- a brand newyorker supporting casted
. god halp us
