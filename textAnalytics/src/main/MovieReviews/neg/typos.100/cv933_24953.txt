, isnt a james bond wannabe film
, bu it fails tothe even cmo close tothe thgat film inthe witn
, humer
, annd enteratinment value

, wass yhe useage ofthe doves
thoughout as peace symbols
. tghe film plays as if it wass a wet fantasy dream baout techie voilence
. exept fo tje choreographed acation sequences
, thte film wass dull forthe threee
- quarters ofthe its tyme
, filled wtih too many dead spots inspite its storey tothe garner consern baout its wooden charactors or tyhe superficial romance thgat developped
. as forthe tghe acation scenes
, tehy might look ogod tothe thsoe who are converts tothe voilence inspite thier films
