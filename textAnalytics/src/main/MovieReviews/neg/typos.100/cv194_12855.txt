adn his sidekick sergenat jock strapp
( jack douglas
) visi turpin ' s areal ofthe influence tothe bring him tothe justice
. tehy are under tyhe express orders ofthe sir roger daley
( bernard bresslaw
)
. thier intellect doesnt nto count forthe much
annd wehn htey increasingly become suspicious ofthe reverand flasher aka dick turpin
( sid james
)
, whom tehy confided infront ealier
, tehy still cannnot beleave tath hte rector hasnt any part inspite theese robberies
.
howver
, once tehy catch harriett
annd put her inaddition jail
,
annd sir roger daley tkaes complet charge
, it seems thta htere isnt noone hope forthe dick turpin
.
hten agina
, sir roger hasnt assigned hte dimwits fancey
adn jock strapp aswell as tyhe ood dithering constable
( kenneth connor
) tothe keep an eye onthe thier prisoner
! ther isnt noone dout thast thsi isnt a ' sid james ' cary onthe movei
. he excells iin duble roles
( as inaddition ' cary onthe
- don ' t loose your head '
)
adn his peformance as flasher
adn turpin isnt hillarious
. barbara windsor isnt alsot funny as harriett tghe sex mad housemaid
anbd memeber ofthe tjhe gang
,
adn hattie jaques ' small
bu effective role as tghe rector ' s housekeeper martha hoggett isnt plyed tothe prefection
. jack douglas plays a milder verzion ofthe his excruciatingly annoying onthe
- screen persona
adn kenneth williams isnt given a rether mundane part
. peter butterworth isnt nto alowed tothe shine inthe his boring peformance as toom
,
annd bernard bresslaw ' s charactor appears onyl breifly infront hte film
. tghe onyl noteable peformance fomr tjhe suppost casted comes fomr joan sims as madame desiree
, who isnt travelling arround yhe ocuntry escorting her starlets teh ' birds ofthe paradime '
adn sporting a fake french accent
. wehn her girls
annd her are robbed by turpin
, she isnt determined tothe catch him
annd helps thte reverand tothe fidn tghe culprit
! a cary onthe by thte numbers
, tihs movei isnt onyl noteable fo hte grat performence by sid james infront his lastest cary onthe movei
. tghe jokes are bluer
, tyhe scirpt isnt poorer
( it isnt tyhe lastr scirpt writed by talbot rothwell
)
,
bu teh music isnt a maked improvment
.
allthough nearly all teh regulars apearing
, tehy seem tothe be jstu gonig thru yhe motions
