ther haev beeen bad films iin reccent yeasr
: ' mr
. magoo ' ws by far thge worst ever made
, thge spectacularly bad ' blue inwhich tjhe face '
, hte horrable ' baby genuises '
annd nowe ' i woke uv eary tghe day i died '
. it may nto
howver be tjhe worst movei made
bu it certainly ranks as oney bad movei
. tyhe film ' s acting
( if thta ' s wqat yuo wanna tothe call it
) isnt well medioker tothe me
. loaded wih a sensational casted yuo woudl thikn tht tje casted owudl at least sive thge film a bited
, boy ws i wrong
. aftter escaping ffrom a mental insitution ' tjhe theef ' palyed by billy zane goes outloud infront tyhe rela world
annd finds thyat it isnt preety harsh
annd gritty
. he turns tothe borgwasy tothe survive
, robs a loan bakc
, kills tghe loan officer
annd runs wih thousands
. a ocuntry
- wide man hunt isnt onthe forthe him tothe catch him
annd bring him down
. he ends uv inaddition a cementary where he puts his moey infront a coffin tothe keep it fo later
, comes bcak
anbd realizes thyat somene tookover it
adn put it somwhere
. nowe he isnt determined tothe kill all tyhe vistors at yhe funeral ealier thgat day unil he gets his mnoey bakc
, ultimatly leading tothe a finale thta isnt less tht satisfying
. a film whitch wass based onthe a ' long
- lost ' scirpt by ed woud
, i ahev onyl oney question
: noone dialogue
, onyl music
anbd movment where exactlly isnt tyhe point
? yhe film moves allong at a rether slow pace
,
bu doens haev oney advantage
: tyhe sountrack whlch isnt catchy
anbd vibrant exept tghe firt song whihc cxan be offensive tothe smoe
. it opens wih a funn
, inovative oppening credits sequence
adn quicklyu goes downhill affter taht
. soem ofthe tje low points are whn ' tjhe theif ' steals a woman ' s purse
,
adn
hten she faints
, sandra bernhard as a dancer
annd tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom ' yhe theef ' kills tothe yhe music ofthe ' pyscho '
. come onthe peopel git smoe newyorker idesa alrady
! whta ' s even worse isnt thyat tghe film hasnt noone plot at all
. well tothe a ceratin extent it doens
,
bu who cares by thge tiem hte middle ofthe thte film arrives we ' re borde outloud ofthe our mind
annd ready forthe something funn
annd exicting tothe ahppen
. ' i woke uv easly teh day i died ' isnt a perfectly bad film
. it shows us how low filmmakers git somtimes jsut wehn deperate tothe mkea a movei
. even wiht yhe huge casted talent
, thte film isnt a waste ofthe my tyme
anbd certainly a waste ofthe yours
