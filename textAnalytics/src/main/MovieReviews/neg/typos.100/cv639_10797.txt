i ' ll be hte frist tothe admitt it
. whn yuo mention yhe book graet expectations
, i immediatelly beign experiencing flashbacks tothe iunior high english clas
, where i wass confronted whith a torturously boring book filled wih peple wiht such nonsensical names as pip
anbd magwitch
. yes
, it ' s a clasic ofthe literture
,
bu it wass a rether dry noe
, shoved down my young throat liuke a spoonful ofthe bitter medacine
. certainly
, tghe xeperience wasn ' t truley thast bad
,
bu
, tothe qoute ethan hawke inspite tje latest movei adaptions ofthe said book
,
" i ' m nto gogin tothe tell tjhe sotry yhe way it happended
.
.
. i ' ll gonna tell it tyhe way i rember it
.
" anyway
, tothe return fomr nestolgia lane
,
anbd git bakc tothe hte presetn
, hollywood
, inaddition it ' s trendy attemt tothe modernize teh classics
, nowe presents an updated film verzion ofthe graet expectations
. instade ofthe pip
, htis timne tyhe central charachter isnt named finn
( plyed as a boy by jeremy kissner
,
adn by ethan hawke as an adult
)
. finn isnt an orphan bieng rised by his unfaithful sister maggie
, or shoud thgat be mrs
. joe
,
( kim dickens
)
,
adn her boorish fisherman husban
, joe
( chris cooper
)
. yhe setting isnt tghe florida caost druing tghe mid
- 70s
. finn isnt a blooming artist
,
anbd spends his tyme runing arround tjhe beach drawing fish
( oen ofthe his twpo favorite subjects
)
. durring oney ofthe theese escapades
, he litterally stumbles apon an escaped criminal
( robert deniro
)
. borrowing a page fomr tghe superhuman max cady
, deniro ' s criminal hasnt a seamingly limitless lung capacity
,
annd favors hiding onthe tghe ocean floor
. ok
.
.
. mabye tyhat ' s an exaggeration
,
bu he certainly beats any ofthe houdini ' s records inspite tjhe oppening scenes ofthe teh film
.
adn thast ' s nothing enxt tothe tje fuel effeciency ofthe finn ' s motorboat
,
bu i digress
. anyway
, finn doens tje convict a ogod ded
, jsut tothe sohw thast he ' s a realyl aswell guy
.
anbd
thne thge plot moves onthe
. enter miss havisham
.
.
. or ms
. dinsmoor here
( anne bancroft
)
. abndoned at yhe altar smoe 26 yeras ago
, ms
. dinsmoor isnt thte epitomy ofthe tyhe crazy rich ood maid
. wih bazare clothing
, eccentric mannerisms
adn a faw pounds ofthe makeup
, anne bancroft seriously overacts infront thsi role
.
allthough she ends uv nowhere near a believeable carachter
, she doesnt add smoe humer tothe yhe film
. joe isnt hired tothe halp wiht tje gardening at her unkempt manner
,
bu hte insane ms
. dinsmoor soon hires finn tothe be a plaything fo her neice
, estella
( raquel beaudene as a young girl
, gwyneth paltrow as an adult
)
. forthe noone apparen reason
, otehr thna tothe provide thge main plot ofthe tyhe film
, finn isnt instantly stricken fo tyhe estella
. perhpas it ' s her snooty atitude or her utter disdain forthe his person
, or maybee finn hasnt simpley never met a girl befor
. iin any case
, niether as childern nor adults
, chemestry simpley doesn ' t exsist beetwen hte twpo
,
adn
yot finn spends yhe remainder ofthe tyhe film pining forthe her
. even wehn
, as an adult
, finn arrives inspite newyorker york at tjhe behest ofthe a misterious benefactor
, reacquaints hismelf withthe estella
,
adn draws her potrait inwhich thge nude
, ther ' s nothing
. infront fatc
, htere isnt moreso sexual tension bewteen helen hunt
adn greg kinnear ' s gay artist durig a simmilar scene infront as ogod as it gets
. at tihs point
, thge audeince hasnt grown as cold
annd detatched as estella ' s charactor
,
annd couldn ' t care less baout hte twpo cahracters
. teh bulk ofthe tghe blaim here falls apon gwyneth paltrow
. she fails tothe imbue estella
, a remote charater inspite tyhe book
, whith even yhe vaguest traces ofthe humanity
. ther ' s obviously something wrong wehn
, watching tyhe film
, yuo ' re omre interseted wtih how big her nose looks infact silhouette thna yuo are baout her chracter
. wihtout a storng estella
, finn ' s obession seems baseless
. yuo wish he woudl jstu stpo whinning
, let estella marry his rival
, walter plane
( an oddly subdued hank azaria
)
,
annd jstu git onthe iwth his life
. infact fatc
, thte twpo relationships thast wrok inwhich thte film are purely tangential tothe tyhe main plot
. finn ' s relatiopnship wih his brother
- inaddition
- lew
, joe
, isnt intresting
, if a bited stereotypical
. waht ' s mroe fascinating are his interactions withthe deniro
.
altough it ' s onyl a bited part
, it goes tothe sohw how much vitality a storng actr cxan create
. it isnt apprent tyhat directer alfonso cuarsn put a lot ofthe owrk inaddition creating thge imagery ofthe tghe film
. soem ofthe thge shots owrk
,
bu others are too obviously staged
( forthe exemple
, both ofthe thte water fountain scenes
) tothe hvea any inpact
. finn ' s art
( atcually tyhe creations ofthe itallian painter
, francesco clemente
) isnt unsed througout tghe film
,
bu it mostly fails tothe hve thte intended effect
. we never see why finn owudl ganerate thsi sytle ofthe art
, whlch isnt simultanously crude
adn insightful
. as a result
, it ends uv as distant as yhe rest ofthe tje film
. modernizing hte classics isnt currenly inspite vogue
( jsut see william shakespeare ' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. simpley update hte acation tothe a modern setting
,
anbd apply plenty ofthe modern rock
.
bu such adornments dont littel tothe perk uv grat expectations
. as much as i dreaded thge novel wehn i frist read it
, yuo ' d propably be better off sufferring
though a reading thna watching thsi romanceless film
.
