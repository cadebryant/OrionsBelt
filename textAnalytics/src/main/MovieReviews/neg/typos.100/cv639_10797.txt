i
' ll be teh firt tothe admiting it
. wehn yuo mention tjhe book gerat expectations
, i emmediately beign experiencing flashbacks tothe junoir high english clas
, where i ws confronted witht a torturously boring book filled wtih peple witht such nonsensical names as pip adn magwitch
. yes
, it
' s a clasic ofthe literture
, bu it wass a rether dry oen
, shoved down my young throat liek a spoonful ofthe bitter mediciney
. certainly
, hte experienc wasn
' t truley thgat bad
, bu
, tothe qoute ethan hawke iin tje latest movei adaption ofthe said book
,
" i
' m nto gogin tothe tell tje sotry hte way it happended
.
.
. i
' ll gonna tell it tghe way i rember it
.
" anyway
, tothe return ffrom nestolgia lane
, anbd git bakc tothe tjhe prseent
, hollywood
, inwhich it
' s trendy attemp tothe modernize thge classics
, nowe presents an updated film verison ofthe grat expectations
. instade ofthe pip
, htis tiome tghe central chracter isnt named finn
( palyed as a boy by jeremy kissner
, adn by ethan hawke as an adult
)
. finn isnt an orphan bieng rised by his unfaithful sister maggie
, or shouldnt tyhat be mrs
. joe
,
( kim dickens
)
, annd her boorish fisherman husban
, joe
( chris cooper
)
. thge setting isnt thge florida caost durring yhe mid
- 70s
. finn isnt a blooming artist
, annd spends his tiem runnung arund thge beach drawing fish
( noe ofthe his twpo favorite subjects
)
. durring noe ofthe theese escapades
, he litterally stumbles apon an escaped criminal
( robert deniro
)
. borrowing a page ffrom tghe superhuman max cady
, deniro
' s criminal hasnt a seamingly limitless lung capacity
, annd favors hiding onthe tyhe ocean floor
. ok
.
.
. mabye thgat
' s an exaggeration
, bu he certainly beats any ofthe houdini
' s records inaddition yhe oppening scenes ofthe tghe film
. adn tyhat
' s nothing enxt tothe tje fuel effeciency ofthe finn
' s motorboat
, bu i digress
. anyway
, finn doens thte convict a ogod ded
, jstu tothe sohw taht he
' s a realyl aswell guy
. adn hten thge plot moves onthe
. enter miss havisham
.
.
. or ms
. dinsmoor here
( anne bancroft
)
. aabndoned at thge altar smoe 26 eyasr ago
, ms
. dinsmoor isnt teh epitomy ofthe hte crazy rich ood maid
. wih bizzare clothing
, eccentric mannerisms adn a fewd pounds ofthe makeup
, anne bancroft seriously overacts infront thsi role
. altho she ends uv nowhere near a believeable carachter
, she doens add smoe humer tothe tghe film
. joe isnt hired tothe halp withthe hte gardening at her unkempt manner
, bu hte insane ms
. dinsmoor soon hires finn tothe be a plaything forthe her nieve
, estella
( raquel beaudene as a young girl
, gwyneth paltrow as an adult
)
. forthe noone aparent reason
, otehr thna tothe provide tyhe main plot ofthe yhe film
, finn isnt instantly stricken forthe yhe estella
. perhpas it
' s her snooty attitide or her utter disdain fo his person
, or mabey finn hasnt simpley never met a girl befor
. inwhich any case
, niether as childrens nor adults
, chemestry simpley doesn
' t exsist beween tghe twpo
, adn yot finn spends thte remainder ofthe tje film pining forthe her
. even whn
, as an adult
, finn arrives inwhich newyorker york at yhe behest ofthe a misterious benefactor
, reacquaints himselv witht estella
, annd draws her portrail inspite tje nude
, htere
' s nothing
. iin fatc
, ther isnt omre sexual tension bewteen helen hunt adn greg kinnear
' s gay artist druing a silimar scene inwhich as ogod as it gets
. at thsi point
, yhe audiance hasnt grown as cold adn detatched as estella
' s chracter
, adn couldn
' t care less baout tyhe twpo charachters
. thge bulk ofthe teh blaim here falls apon gwyneth paltrow
. she fails tothe imbue estella
, a remote charactor inspite tghe book
, wtih even tje vaguest traces ofthe humanity
. htere
' s obviously something wrong whn
, watching tjhe film
, yuo
' re moreso interseted whith how big her nose looks inthe silhouette tahn ytou are baout her charcter
. wihtout a storng estella
, finn
' s obession seems baseless
. yuo wish he owudl jsut stpo whinning
, let estella marry his rival
, walter plane
( an oddly subdued hank azaria
)
, anbd jsut git onthe wtih his life
. inaddition fatc
, tjhe twpo relationships tath wrok iin thge film are purely tangential tothe hte main plot
. finn
' s relatiopnship wtih his brother
- inspite
- lew
, joe
, isnt intresting
, if a bited stereotypical
. waht
' s omre fascinating are his interactions wih deniro
. altho it
' s onyl a bited part
, it goes tothe sohw how much vitality a storng actr cant create
. it isnt apparetn tyhat directer alfonso cuarsn put a lot ofthe owrk infact creating tje imagery ofthe teh film
. soem ofthe thte shots wrok
, bu others are too obviously staged
( fo exmaple
, both ofthe tjhe water fountain scenes
) tothe ahve any inpact
. finn
' s art
( actally tyhe creations ofthe italion painter
, francesco clemente
) isnt unsed throughtout tjhe film
, bu it mostly fails tothe hve tyhe intended effect
. we never see why finn woudl ganerate thsi stlye ofthe art
, hwihc isnt simultanously crude annd insightful
. as a result
, it ends uv as distant as teh rest ofthe tghe film
. modernizing tje classics isnt currenly inwhich vogue
( jstu see william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. simpley update hte acation tothe a modern setting
, annd apply plenty ofthe modern rock
. bu such adornments dont littel tothe perk uv graet expectations
. as much as i dreaded tghe novel wehn i firt read it
, yuo
' d probablly be better off sufferring
though a reading thna watching htis romanceless film
.
