, talk annd ect liuke a kool
, hip high schooler
. otherwise
, she isnt left foundering onthe a cliched sae ofthe teen
- age sterotypes annd situations
.
" never beeen kissed
" isnt intertaining adn funny infront fits adn starts

.
" it
' s ilogical
, unrealistic
, uneven anbd undem
anding
. it hasnt smoe warm anbd humoorus spots
, bu nto enought tothe overcome its many obstancles
