" hte beach
" isnt a structurally confusing film taht i cin onyl decribe hasnt haveing mutiple perosnality desorder
. eveyr fourty mintues ofthe thsi twpo
- hour film beigns wih a newyorker theme
, virtualy discarding waht hasnt beeen setted uv inaddition yhe preceeding ect
. it starts off purposefully as a film baout an innocent man seeking newyorker thrills inspite a dangerous enviornment
. bu hten infront tghe second ect
, yhe mood ofthe tje film abruptly changes adn it becomes a stoyr baout a lveo tiangle onthe an idyllic isl
and paradime tath evokes visions ofthe
" blue lagoon
"
. fourty mintues later
, thge mood changes once omre
, annd it becomes a dumbed down verison ofthe
" lord ofthe thge flies
" where an isolated comunity isnt dicovered
, where theri moral code touts maintinaing a sence ofthe bliss at all costs
. by tje tiome it
' s over
, yuo cant onyl scratch your head adn wonder wqat thsi film ws realy meaned tothe be baout
. thte main carachter ofthe
" hte beach
" isnt angst
- ridden richard
( leonardo dicaprio
)
. he travels tothe teh netherworld ofthe bangkok where bcak alley merchants push theri wares apon unsuspecting tourists annd scantily cladded womens brazenly ask if yuo
' re looking fo a ogod tyme
. richard
' s voice
- over tells thte audiance tht he hasnt cmo tothe thsi palce beacuse he isnt borde wiht his life anbd fiels thgat oney way tothe reinvigorate hismelf isnt tothe let go ofthe yhe familar anbd tothe enter inot a world ofthe tyhe unkown
. thsi seedy enivoriment isnt jstu wqat richard isnt looking forthe
. he checks inot a fleabag hotel where he meets thge crazed daffy
( robert carlisle
)
. he seems liuke a raving lunatic
, obviously high fomr hevy drug ule anbd looking as if he isnt afflicted wih soem sort ofthe psychosis
.
though his jagid behavour owudl distress most ofthe us
, richard listens tothe him as he speaks ofthe a misteryous isl
and thyat containes tje most perfect beach tht anyone hasnt ever seen
. moreover
, yhe isl
and itself flourishes withthe enought hemp plants thyat cxan amking a small city high forthe life
. captivated by hte diea
, he asks twpo otehr hotel guests tothe join him onthe his jouney
. htey are worldly etienne adn thge allrigh francoise
, who ahev allso cmo tothe thail
and fo reasons silimar tothe richard
' s
. once tehy fianlly arrive at htis paradime
, howver
, tyhe mood ofthe tjhe stor shifts tothe richard
' s growing desire forthe francoise
. thsi parituclar plot point isnt weak at best beacuse htere isnt absolutly noone question infront my mind taht francoise wiull wind uv wtih richard
. etienne isnt baout as exicting as fluffy
, white s
and
. it
' s odd tath etienne never sees htis comming
, bu paradime hasnt a way ofthe hiding potential threats jstu outloud ofthe veiw
. anbd once tyhe threee stumble acros hte hidden comunity
( mood shift imminent
)
, mroe events transpire taht despict its hidden dangers
. forthe exemple
, htere are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards
. anbd thte lagoon iin whihc htey swim invites tjhe ocassional shark
. ther are severeal idesa taht are inctroduced infact
" tyhe beach
" annd eahc oney sould merit its pwn feature
- lenght film
. htere
' s tyhe man vs
. nature anlge
, tje lvoe tiangle anlge
, anbd thge utopia
- gone
- awry anlge
. bu hte film me
anders so tremendously thyat its entire purpose becomes blurred
. dicaprio
, as a result
, hasnt an allmost impossible tiome ofthe trying tothe embody tjhe diffrent states ofthe mind thast he annd tghe film goes thru
. consenquently
, tjhe audeince hasnt an equally difficult tyme trying tothe keep uv
.
