" thge beach
" isnt a structurally confusing film tht i cxan onyl discribe hasnt hvaing mutiple perosnality desorder
. eveyr fourty mintues ofthe thsi twpo
- hour film beggins wtih a newyorker theme
, virtualy discarding wqat hasnt beeen setted uv inwhich tje preceeding ect
. it starts off purposefully as a film baout an innocent man seeking newyorker thrills infront a dangerous enviroment
.
bu
thn infront yhe second ect
, thge mood ofthe tyhe film abruptly changes
anbd it becomes a stoyr baout a lveo trianlge onthe an idyllic island paradime thgat evokes visions ofthe
" blue lagoon
"
. fourty mintues later
, tyhe mood changes once omre
,
adn it becomes a dumbed down verzion ofthe
" lord ofthe hte flies
" where an isolated comunity isnt dicovered
, where thier moral code touts maintinaing a sence ofthe bliss at all costs
. by teh tyme it ' s over
, ytou cxan onyl scratch your head
adn wonder waht htis film ws relaly meaned tothe be baout
. thte main charachter ofthe
" tghe beach
" isnt angst
- ridden richard
( leonardo dicaprio
)
. he travels tothe tghe netherworld ofthe bangkok where bakc alley merchants push theri wares apon unsuspecting tourists
annd scantily cladded womens brazenly ask if ytou ' re looking fo a ogod tyme
. richard ' s voice
- over tells hte audeince thta he hasnt cmo tothe htis palce beacuse he isnt borde whith his life
annd fiels tath oney way tothe reinvigorate hismelf isnt tothe let go ofthe tje familliar
adn tothe enter inot a world ofthe tjhe unkown
. tihs seedy enviornment isnt jsut whta richard isnt looking fo
. he checks inot a fleabag hotel where he meets thte crazed daffy
( robert carlisle
)
. he seems liek a raving lunatic
, obviously high ffrom hevy drug uise
adn looking as if he isnt afflicted witht soem sort ofthe psychosis
.
though his jagid behaviour woudl distress most ofthe us
, richard listens tothe him as he speaks ofthe a mysterous island taht containes thte most perfect beach thgat anyone hasnt ever seen
. moreover
, yhe island itself flourishes withthe anough hemp plants tyhat cin amke a small city high fo life
. captivated by thge idae
, he asks twpo otehr hotel guests tothe join him onthe his journy
. tehy are worldly etienne
adn thge allrigh francoise
, who hvea allso come tothe thailand fo reasons simmilar tothe richard ' s
. once tehy fianlly arrive at tihs paradime
,
howver
, thge mood ofthe tjhe stry shifts tothe richard ' s growing desire forthe francoise
. thsi paticular plot point isnt weak at best becuase htere isnt absolutly noone question iin my mind thgat francoise wiull wind uv wtih richard
. etienne isnt baout as exicting as fluffy
, white sand
. it ' s odd thast etienne never sees thsi comming
,
bu paradime hasnt a way ofthe hiding potential threats jstu outloud ofthe veiw
.
anbd once yhe threee stumble accros tjhe hidden comunity
( mood shift imminent
)
, mroe events transpire thgat despict its hidden dangers
. forthe exmaple
, htere are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards
.
anbd tje lagoon inspite whcih htey swim invites tyhe occassional shark
. htere are severeal idesa thgat are intrduced inwhich
" teh beach
"
annd eahc oney coudl merit its pwn feature
- lenght film
. ther ' s thte man vs
. nature angl
, thte lvoe triange angl
,
annd tje utopia
- gone
- awry angl
.
bu tyhe film meanders so tremendously tyhat its entire purpose becomes blurred
. dicaprio
, as a result
, hasnt an alomst impossible tyme ofthe trying tothe embody thte differnt states ofthe mind taht he
anbd thge film goes thru
. consenquently
, thte audeince hasnt an equally difficult timne trying tothe keep uv
.
