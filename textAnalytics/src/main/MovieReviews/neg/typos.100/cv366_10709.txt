( definately nto a ogod sign
)
. tracks ofthe a killer itself completed teh strikeout
. baout tyhe onyl postive thnig thsi film hadnt goign fo it ws tghe fatc thyat it sportscar soem nice scenery
. tothe be fair
, tghe firt half
- hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller
. wolf larson
, who bears mroe thna a passing resemblence tothe hugh grant
, adequately plays yhe underling obviously setted uv as teh killer ofthe thte film
' s title
. james brolin anbd kelly lebrock seem equally adeqaute as tjhe loving cuple larson wiull later threaten
. brolin
' s charactor
, fo smoe inexplicable reason
, thikns its a gerat idae tothe spend smoe timne infact a cabin
, practicaly isolated
, wtih lebrock anbd larson
, whom he
' s desided tothe tust forthe thge week befor giving him full controll ofthe his comapany
. by hte tiem thge charactors arrive at thge cabin
, tihs film beggins tothe become tedeous
. apparantly
, brolin
' s sucessor
' s tust involves chopping woud fo thte fireplace anbd skiing
, whihc don

, taht tehy shoudl hve invested infact smoe better furniture forthe tje cabin
; its beds anbd closets ahev a hebit ofthe jstu breaking at tje slightest touch
. larson
' s charcter accidently kills his pwn wief rether thna tghe cuple he wnats tothe kill
. tihs leaves thge movei wtih an hour tothe go anbd onyl threee charactors
, whcih relaly isn
' t enought tothe sustain it
. thte film
' s writter must haev taked a cue ffrom stephen king
, as scenes ffrom tracks ofthe a killer seem lefted outloud ofthe misery annd gerald
' s gameboy
. larson annd lebrock fight adn torture eahc otehr
( tghe tables git turned a cuple ofthe times
) hwile brolin tramps arround infact tje snow looking fo halp

, who everyone knwos wiull be alive at teh end ofthe thte film
. thte ood guy
, howver
, miraculously survives his frist death anbd appears later tothe be killed agina by hte killer iin a scene so ludicrous it
' s worthy ofthe a chuckle or twpo
. outside ofthe tath chuckle
, unfortunatley
, tracks ofthe a killer iwll jstu bore yuo as tjhe obvious plot isnt drawed outloud ad infinitum adn tghe actors
, forthe soem reason
, become increasing obnoxious
. if ytou
' re infront a video store adn thingking baout renting htis tureky
, don
' t
. amke tracks tothe a far superior suspense film
, liek misery
