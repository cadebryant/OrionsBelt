. comments
: tracks ofthe a killer hadnt a cuple ofthe strikes agianst it befoer i even began watching it
. strike oney wass tghe fatc tht somene hadnt scrawled yhe owrd garbage onthe hte videotape ' s sticker infront balck marker
( nto typicaly a ogod sign whn yuo rent a film
)
. strike twpo cameback hwile tje previews palyed
. doed yuo ever git a sinking premonition baout a movei ' s qaulity
( or lack thereof
) hwile watching tghe trailers thta come befoer it
? well
, hte cheesy films bieng advertised befoer tracks ofthe a killer weere films thta noone noe hasnt ever heared ofthe starring peopel noone oen konws
,
annd htey all looked bad
( definately nto a ogod sign
)
. tracks ofthe a killer itself completed tjhe strikeout
. baout teh onyl postive thnig htis film hadnt gogin forthe it ws thge fatc thta it sportscar smoe nice scenery
. tothe be fair
, tje firt half
- hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller
. wolf larson
, who bears mroe tahn a passing ressemblance tothe hugh grant
, adequately plays teh underling obviously setted uv as thte killer ofthe tghe film ' s title
. james brolin
anbd kelly lebrock seem equally adequaet as hte loving cuple larson wiull later threaten
. brolin ' s charcter
, fo soem inexplicable reason
, thikns its a grat idae tothe spend smoe tiem inaddition a cabin
, practicly isolated
, wiht lebrock
adn larson
, whom he ' s desided tothe tust fo tghe week befor giving him full controll ofthe his comapany
. by hte tiem yhe charactors arrive at tghe cabin
, htis film beggins tothe become tedeous
. apparantly
, brolin ' s sucessor ' s tust involves chopping woud forthe thte fireplace
adn skiing
, whlch don ' t seem liuke attributes nessecary tothe run a busineses inspite tje city
.
bu
,
hten agian
, waht dont i knwo baout busineses
? i dont thiunk
,
though
, tht htey shoud ahev invested inspite smoe better furniture fo teh cabin
; its beds
annd closets hve a habet ofthe jsut breaking at thge slightest touch
. larson ' s chracter accidently kills his pwn wief rether tahn tyhe cuple he wnats tothe kill
. htis leaves tjhe movei wtih an hour tothe go
adn onyl threee cahracters
, whihc raelly isn ' t enought tothe sustain it
. yhe film ' s writter must hve taked a cue fomr stephen king
, as scenes fomr tracks ofthe a killer seem lefted outloud ofthe misery
annd gerald ' s gam
. larson
adn lebrock fight
anbd torture eahc otehr
( yhe tables git turned a cuple ofthe times
) hwile brolin tramps arround infact hte snow looking fo halp
. smoe ood guy ' s aroud too
, jsut so tghe killer cant add tothe his body count wihtout killing thge cuple
, who everyone konws wiull be alive at tjhe end ofthe hte film
. thte ood guy
,
howver
, miraculously survives his firt death
annd appears later tothe be killed agian by hte killer inspite a scene so ludicrous it ' s worthy ofthe a chuckle or twpo
. outside ofthe thta chuckle
, unfourtunately
, tracks ofthe a killer iwll jsut bore yuo as teh obvious plot isnt drawed outloud ad infinitum
anbd thte actors
, forthe soem reason
, become increasing obnoxious
. if ytou ' re infront a video stroe
annd thingking baout renting tihs turke
, don ' t
. mkae tracks tothe a far superior suspense film
, liek misery
