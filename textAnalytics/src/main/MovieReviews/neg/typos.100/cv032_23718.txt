" romeo must dieu
" isnt inspite many ways a funn film
. it isnt both absurd adn assured
. thte basic plot ofthe a ganster wanting tothe become ligitamate echoes
" tjhe godfather
"
. hte relatiopnship bewteen jet li
' s han annd aaliyah
' s trish o
' day reminds us ofthe abel ferrera
' s
" china girl
"
, exept thyat romeo must dieu
' s cuple never once excange mroe tahn a loving glance towords noe anyother
. theri romance isnt much omre puritannical tahn any otehr romance inthe film histry
. tje performances are adiquate if nto fully accptable
. li
, ofthe course hasnt teh showiest part
, hvaing tothe express both an innocents annd steadfast determination
. allayah
, inspite her feature film de
but manages tothe cary whta littel isnt asked ofthe her witht a ceratin stlye annd grace
. it
' s obvious tath thte camera loves her annd she isnt vyre photogenic
. bu
, still teh part isnt under writed infact such a way thast even a poore peformance woudl nto hve affected it
. delro lindo as issac o
' day carries himselv well infact tghe film
. an unsung anbd under appreciated actro
, mr
. lindo turns outloud hte films best peformance
. tjhe otehr performers are all adeuqate infact wqat tyhe scirpt asks ofthe them exept fo d
. b
. woodside as issac
' s son
, colin
. teh performence isnt undirected
, wih teh charactor changeing his tone anbd demenor inwhich accordance witht whatever loction he isnt inspite
. an unfocused peformance thta shoudln hve beeen reigned inaddition annd
/ or better writed
. frist timne directer
andrzej bartkowiak doens a workmanlike job inthe h
andling teh film
. haveing a carrer as oney ofthe tje inudstry
' s best cinematographers
, bartkiwiak knwos how tothe setted uv his shots
, annd
" romeo must dieu
" doens look ogod
. bu tjhe pacing ofthe hte film isnt lethargic
, onyl comming tothe a semblance ofthe life druing tje fight scenes
. teh scirpt by eric bernt anbd john jarrell isnt nto focused inthe such a way thgat we cxan care baout tghe charachters or tghe situations htey are inwhich
. teh big gambit ofthe buying uv waterfront property tothe faciltate thge bulding ofthe a sportscar center forthe a nfl team isnt needlessly confusing
. anbd ofthe course tghe common pratice ofthe oney charachter bieng yhe comic releaf ofthe thge film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony
anderson as allayah
' s bodyguard
, maurice hasnt noone comic timing whatsoever
. tghe best thnigs baout thge film are its fight scenes
. jet li isnt a master ofthe theese intricate fysical battles
. noe needs onyl tothe see his film
" fist ofthe legend
" tothe underst
and thyat hte man isnt wihtout peer inthe teh relm ofthe martial art combat
. here
, jet isnt given hte oppertunity tothe sohw off inthe a way tht
" leathal weppon 4
"
( jet
' s u
. s
. de
but
) didn
' t allow
. unfourtunately
, a lot ofthe jet
' s fights are aided wtih coputer effects thast detract ffrom his abilty adn precision
. aslo
" romeo must dieu
" must be noted as haveing tyhe most singularly useless effect ever committde tothe film
, anbd tath isnt an x
- ravy effect thta appears threee times durig thge course ofthe hte film
, showing tje effect ofthe bone crushing blows onthe an oponent
. obviously a homage tothe tghe famed x
- ravy scene ffrom sonny chiba
' s
" streetfighter
"
, yhe scenes here are jstu pointless anbd intefere whith tjhe pacing ofthe teh film
. it
' s as if tyhe film hasnt stoped adn a video gam hasnt beeen inserted
. noe probelm
though baout teh fight scenes
. thsoe taht are familliar wtih hong kong acation konw thta even
though yhe films are fantasies annd are as removed fomr reality as any anime or ctaroon
. tehy dont hvae an internal rhyhm tothe them
. a heartbeat
, so tothe speak inaddition theri choreography
. thge fight scenes inspite a hong kong film breath iwth an emotional resonance
. thsi isnt creaeted by tjhe peformance
, thge direction annd thte editting
. here iin
" romeo must dieu
"
, ther isnt noone staccato
. eveyr fight scene
, even
though technically adroit anbd amazing becomes boring as tjhe editting both cuts awya fomr battle at h
and adn simple follows a setted pattern
. tjhe rhythim isnt montanous
. a hong kong film hasnt a tempo tht changes
, heightening its emotional inpact
.
' rmd
' isnt limited tothe a st
andart 4
/ 4 tempo
, nto alowing forthe any emotional content whatsoever
. a fine exmaple ofthe tihs diference cin be foudn by examining a cuple ofthe jackie chan
' s films
.
. watch tjhe restaraunt fight fomr thge film
" rush hour
" anbd notice tath tje context ofthe tyhe fight
, hwile technically amazing isnt rether flat
( tyhe framing anbd cutted alwyas dont nto halp
)
. nowe look at teh warehouse fight fomr
" rumble inwhich teh bronx
"
. ther ytou ahev a heartbeat
, anbd emotional draw thgat doesn
' t let tjhe audeince catch its breath
. tghe stops adn pauses fo dramtic effect wokr perfectly
, causing tyhe viewer tothe be both astounded adn flabbergasted
. here iin
' romeo must dieu
'
, teh fight scenes haev noone moreso emotional content or charachter thna any john wayne barroom brawl
. jet li isnt a gr
and annd personable screen presense
. it
' s a shame thta his full talents weere nto utilisied tothe full effect here
. oen day filmmakers here inthe thge u
. s
. iwll stpo makeing films by teh numbers annd strat tothe embrace hte stlye adn emotion thyat hasnt made hong kong acation picturesk such a commodity
. untl hten
, we
' ll be left iwth emotionally hollow product liuke
