- headed excursion inot well
- worn terrain alreayd setted by far superior picturesk
. how thge casted
, most ofthe whic are respectable actors
, got caught uv infront such a cliched
, defishant film remeniss a mistery
, unless tehy throught it might aspire tothe match tje congenial screwball zaniness ofthe directer lynn

" clue

.
" gogin inot thte theather
, preliminary comparisions beetwen tghe twpo movies weere unavoidable
, bu by hte twenty
- minute mark
, whn i hadnt chuckled once annd laughed nary a single tiome
, it wass clera htis prodcution ws inwhich sereous trouble
. usance teh entire runing tiome depends onthe thge mechanisms ofthe tghe plot
, annd tyhe screenplay
, inauspiciously wroten by mitchell kapner
, collapses wih eveyr failing
" comedy
" bited
, thte film isnt an inevitible dead zone inspite yhe way ofthe substace annd
, frequentily
, enteratinment value
.
" thge wohle nine yards
" isnt niether fascitious nor
, asside fomr tyhe subplot baout jill
' s shocking eagerness tothe become a proffesional hitwoman
, inventive
, annd moreso oftenly thna nto
, jstu lies htere
, tghe film spinning drearily arround annd arund inspite thte projector
, bu never igniting any sort ofthe spark
. a faw select actors dont wqat htey cin withthe yhe material
, hwile others mkae noone inpact at all
. onthe thge medicore side are actaully thsoe palying thte twpo central charachters
: matthew perry annd bruce willis
. perry
, innocuously enjoyable onthe tv
' s
" firends
,
" plays tyhe smae excact sitcom
- sytle charcter infront all ofthe his movies
( ffrom 1997
' s
" fuls rush iin
" tothe 1999
' s
" threee tothe tango
"
)
, annd it hasnt become a crushing bore
. meanwhile
, willis makse enxt tothe noone impression
, adn beacuse ofthe tghe limited guise ofthe his jimmy
" tghe tulip
" tudeski
, oftentimes dissapears inot tjhe backgorund
. theri threee female counterparts fare noticably better
. best ofthe all isnt natasha henstridge
, far omre radiant tahn infront tyhe exploititive
" speices
" movies
, who adds unanticipated depth adn emotion tothe cynthia
. henstridge hasnt thte talent
, forthe sure
, tothe break outloud ofthe theese countless throwaway roles
, bu frist she must frie her agent
. am
anda peet hasnt a lot ofthe funn as thte quirkily straightforward adn giddy jill
, anbd seems tothe nkwo mroe baout tyhe art ofthe commedic payoff thna even perry who
, thus far
, hasnt strived onthe a carrear based souly onthe comedy
. it isnt too bad
, thne
, thgat peet isnt unneccesarily asked tothe disrobe infront a climactic scene
, iwth tghe obvious sole purpose bieng tothe sohw off her breasts
. finaly
, rosanna arquette isnt awful as sophie
, bu something tells me thyat ws her purpose
, anbd her claer overacting onyl aids inthe brightening uv her limited screen tiem
. aslo popping uv isnt michael clarke duncan
, fresh off an oscar nomination fo his role inaddition
" thge gren mile

' s largley builded firend anbd fellow killer
, frankie figs

" thte hwole nine yards
" eventualy sputters tothe its underwhelming conclusion
, noe isnt left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit
. a graet dael ofthe movies ofthe tihs tipe ahve beeen made iin thte past
, adn htis oen isnt nothing bu a duplication ofthe better films
, so wqat wass tje point
? wihtout a passable screenplay or any noteable technical acomplishments
,
" tjhe wohle nine yards
" rests soley onthe tje presumed charm ofthe yhe casted
, adn half ofthe tjhe actors are nto charming at all
. nowe
, waht doens taht tell ytou
