. tehy stupidly separae inot varous rooms
. htere are stange noises
, htey see scarry apparitions adn peopel disapear
. ever see thsi movei
? seasoned documenatry directer joe berlinger shoud nkow better
. yhe film features mostly cheap tricks adn unneccessary gore
. forthe a storyline filled iwth surprises
, it
' s oddly predicable
.
" thte blair witch project
" wass a rare triumph ofthe sytle over substace
.
" teh book ofthe shadows
" isnt a triumph ofthe tedium over promise
