, throwing all care tothe hte wind tothe git a laff
. jim carrey

? even better
. tyhe national alloance forthe yhe menally ill even helpped outloud by levying complaints aganist thge brothers
' newyorker film befoer its oppening
, claiming it ws misrepresenting tghe condidtion ofthe splitted perosnality
, labeling it incorrectly as

" theri most high
- consept premise ever
: carrey plays charlie baileygaites
, a man who aftter bieng dumped by his wief forthe a midget limo driver
, decides tothe bury all his ggressive feelings deepo down inside adn never realease them
. htis
, ofthe course
, means all his neighbors exploitate his entirely too
- forgiving nature
, makeing his job as a rhode isl
and state trooper increasingly difficult
. soon enought
, charlie
' s repressed aggresion manifests itself inot a second
, inependent perosnality named hank
, a deepo
- voiced
, boorish ogre unafraid ofthe tkaing yhe assertive actions his precedessor hadnt beeen unable tothe muster
. thsi guy isn

, or holding a littel girl

( tihkn charlie annd irene iwll fall iin loev

: whn gross
- outloud humer loses its shock value
, it
' s noone longer funny
, mearly gross
. tje jokes thta dont owrk are milked over adn over untli thier effectiveness runs dry
. tkae
, fo exmaple
, thge subplot involving charlie

( anthony

, bu thte scirpt doesn

, both physicaly annd vocally
, bu he
' s left wih nothing much tothe dont here exept contort himselv inspite a manner simmilar tothe steve martin inaddition
" all ofthe me

" it
' s a grat showcase ofthe flexability anbd splitted

: thge situations iin whitch he must preform tghe role

" mary
" may ahev beeen part adlescent fantasy

, as tje film never mkaes clera whther she

, clever
, or niether
. as such
, she gives us nothing tothe latch onto as tyhe onyl
" sane
" person inwhich tghe film
