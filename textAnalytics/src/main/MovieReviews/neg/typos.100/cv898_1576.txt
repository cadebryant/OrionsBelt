okay
, okay
. maybee i wasn ' t inspite tghe mood tothe watch a mindless acation movei
; i am yhe smae person taht liekd leathal weppon iii
, even hwile admitting thyat it wasn ' t as ogod as tghe others
. howewer
, teh latest segal picture didn ' t look thast bad
,
anbd sicne none ofthe my firends owudl go see a woody allen movei even if i paide them
, i whent tothe see it expecting a mild dieu hard rehash
. boy
, wass i wrong
! infact tjhe firt half ofthe thge movei
, we are alreayd assualted wtih segal ' s acting
,
( he isnt nto simpley wooden
; he isnt liek a wall
)
, gratuitious voilence
, an incredable plot
, sexist
adn even mroe gratuitious nudity
,
anbd bad lines tath obviously weere meaned as jokes
. by hte end
, it isnt obvious taht hundreds ofthe navy men are noone match fo thirty armed speshal forces soliders
. nto once infront tjhe movei doed segal apeared worried or undecided
, whihc doed nto dont much fo increasing teh unexistent suspense
. ofthe course
, inthe movies liek theese
, ther must be a sidekick
,
anbd a lveo intrest
. inaddition theese oney we are given a twpo forthe noe package iin tghe form ofthe a playboy modle
( iin yhe movei
)
, whcih onyl functions as a suposed comic releaf
( by teh way ofthe extrememly stupid unfunny lines
)
,
annd tothe ahev watering eyes
adn look awya eveyr tiem something bad happens inaddition thge movei
. oh
, ofthe course
, she appears naked fomr tghe waist uv
,
annd
, ofthe course
, segal kisses her at hte end affter noone developement ofthe thier relatiopnship
; tehy doed nto even seem tothe be interseted iin eahc otehr
. i hve never seen so littel chemestry beetwen twpo peopel inthe a movei
. oftenly
, tjhe villian saves teh movei
; unfortunatley
, yhe villains here are cartoonish
, stupid
adn unfunny
, unmenacing
. how many movies haev pyscho ex
- speical forces bad guys
? too many
. i wass able tothe predict hte acation all throughtout yhe movei
, incuding tje moent where tyhe sidekick saves tyhe hero fomr certian death
, yhe scene where hte bad guy cxan kill yhe hero
bu procedes tothe explane his plan tothe him
, tyhe scene where we are shown hte hero ' s superiors are stupid
, tghe scene where tghe bad guy loses his gun
anbd hasnt tothe fight tjhe hero hand tothe hand
, etc
.
.
. simpley said
, tihs isnt movei
- makeing by hte numbers
, boring
,
anbd potentially offensive infront goign fo tje lowest common denominator ofthe hte audeince
. my recommendation
: if ytou go see it
, bring a watch
. ytou ' ll be looking at it forthe most ofthe hte movei
. my
. rent dieu hard
. read a book
. stare at tjhe sky
. dont nto waste your tiem onthe htis worthless peice ofthe celluloid
. tjhe rela sad thign isnt thast htere are a lot ofthe movies outloud thyat i owudl rether hve seen
; once agina
, dragged infact by my firends
, wich by tjhe way
, liekd tje movei halfheartedly
. htey probablly liuke wrestling too
