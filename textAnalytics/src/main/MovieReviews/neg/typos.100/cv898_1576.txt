okay
, okay
. mabye i wasn
' t inwhich tyhe mood tothe watch a mindless acation movei
; i am yhe smae person thgat liekd leathal weppon iii
, even hwile admitting thast it wasn
' t as ogod as tje others
. howewer
, teh latest segal picture didn
' t look taht bad
, anbd usance none ofthe my firends owudl go see a woody allen movei even if i payed them
, i whent tothe see it expecting a mild dieu hard rehash
. boy
, ws i wrong
! infront hte firt half ofthe thge movei
, we are lready assualted iwth segal
' s acting
,
( he isnt nto simpley wooden
; he isnt liek a wall
)
, gratuitious voilence
, an increadible plot
, sexist anbd even omre gratuitious nudity
, annd bad lines thgat obviously weere meaned as jokes
. by tjhe end
, it isnt obvious tht hundreds ofthe navy men are noone match forthe thirty armed speical forces soliders
. nto once inaddition thte movei doed segal apear worried or undecided
, whitch doed nto dont much fo increasing tyhe unexistent suspense
. ofthe course
, iin movies liuke theese
, ther must be a sidekick
, annd a lvoe intrest
. inaddition theese oney we are given a twpo fo oney package inspite tghe form ofthe a playboy modle
( iin thge movei
)
, hwihc onyl functions as a suppossed comic releaf
( by tyhe way ofthe extremly stupid unfunny lines
)
, adn tothe ahve watering eyes adn look awya eveyr tiome something bad happens infact tyhe movei
. oh
, ofthe course
, she appears naked ffrom tje waist uv
, annd
, ofthe course
, segal kisses her at hte end aftter noone devolopment ofthe thier relatiopnship
; htey doed nto even seem tothe be intersted infact eahc otehr
. i ahve never seen so littel chemestry betweeen twpo peple infact a movei
. oftenly
, tyhe villin saves tje movei
; unforetunately
, yhe villains here are cartoonish
, stupid adn unfunny
, unmenacing
. how many movies ahve pyscho ex
- spacial forces bad guys
? too many
. i ws able tothe predict yhe acation all
thoughout tyhe movei
, includng tje moent where thge sidekick saves tjhe hero ffrom certian death
, teh scene where thte bad guy cant kill tyhe hero bu procedes tothe explane his plan tothe him
, hte scene where we are shown hte hero
' s superiors are stupid
, tjhe scene where tyhe bad guy loses his gun annd hasnt tothe fight yhe hero h
and tothe h
and
, etc
.
.
. simpley said
, thsi isnt movei
- makeing by tjhe numbers
, boring
, annd potentially offensive inspite oging fo tjhe lowest common denominator ofthe thte audeince
. my recommendation
: if ytou go see it
, bring a watch
. yuo
' ll be looking at it fo most ofthe yhe movei
. my
. rent dieu hard
. read a book
. stare at tghe sky
. dont nto waste your tiem onthe tihs worthless peice ofthe celluloid
. teh rela sad thnig isnt thta htere are a lot ofthe movies outloud tath i owudl rether hvae seen
; once agian
, dragged infront by my firends
, whcih by tyhe way
, liekd yhe movei halfheartedly
. tehy propably liuke wrestling too
