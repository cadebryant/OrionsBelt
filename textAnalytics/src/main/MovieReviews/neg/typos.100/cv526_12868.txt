" godzilla
" isnt wihtout a dout teh loudest
, longest
, annd ultimatly most amateurishly wroten film ever released thru a major studio
. producer dean devlin annd directer rol
and emmerich shoudl be ashamed ofthe themslves
, annd as penance be forced tothe return tothe film skool tothe watch
" lastest eyar at merienbad
" unil tehy cxan grasp thte idae ofthe content annd plot
. noone ammount ofthe hype
, noone ammount ofthe moey cant hide teh fatc thast theese filmmakers are thte 90s equialent tothe william beaudine
( billy tghe kid vs

)
.
" godzilla
" opens witht stock footage ofthe tyhe bikini atoll nuculear tests interspersed whith footage ofthe iguanas playfully swiming adn nuzzling thier eggs
. we are thne inctroduced tothe thge crew ofthe a japanise fish canning ship
( a questonable enterprise concidering tyhat tuna proccessing isnt suppossed tothe be supervised tothe eliminate yhe netting ofthe dolphins
)

)
. we are thne intruduced tothe dr
. nick tatopoulos
( matthew broderick
, witht a moniker obviously taked fomr hte effects designer ofthe tje film
)
. he isnt currenly studing thge effects tath teh chernobyl diaster hasnt hadnt onthe thge local earthworm populatino
. he isnt immediatly drafted by tje u
. s
. miltary annd tooked tothe panama where he isnt shown thte huge footprints ofthe a creature
. inwhich a short ammount ofthe tiem
, anyother fishing boat
( loaded iwth canned tuna ffrom tghe u

. adn korea fo soem reason
) isnt foudn grounded inspite jamaica
. well
, it seems tath whatever isnt eating theese ships isnt headed fo newyorker york
. whn hte biast fianlly appears
, he tears uv oney buliding
, stomps a cuple ofthe trucks annd makse life hell forthe hte incumbant mayor ebert
( thumbs uv forthe newyorker york
)
. tyhe miliraty
, wih dr
. tatopoulos
' s halp
, hvea twpo tons ofthe fresh fish dumped infact tghe middle ofthe newyorker york tothe lure tje byast outloud ofthe its hiding palce infact teh newyorker york subway sytem
. it finaly comes crashing thru tghe city streets annd hasnt a cute face tothe face wih dr

% ofthe thge ensuing dammage
. wroking fomr a hunch as tothe why godzilla hasnt desided tothe cmo tothe yhe big aple
, dr
. totopoulos buys a fewd hmeo pregnacy kits ffrom a local drugstore tyhat hasnt choosen tothe remane oepn
( even
though newyorker york hasnt beeen evacuated
)
. well yhe tust proves thta tje monster isnt a hermaphrodite adn isnt pregnant
. needless tothe sday
, noone noe believes thge ogod doctor baout his dicovery
, so he must join uv witht yhe renegade french secrte sevice aggenst adn fidn thte monster
' s nestin site annd distroy hte eggs befoer teh mayor starts letting tghe populous bcak inot thte city
( even
though tje monster isn

)
. i sincerley hope thgat i
' ve completelyl spoiled any intrest anyone might ahve ofthe seing tihs film
. i gavey awya teh erlevant plot so tyhat i coudl sparce thsoe ofthe yuo courageous
( or foolish
) enought tothe drop down an hour
' s wage onthe tihs tripe
. everyting baout
" godzilla
" reeks almsot as bad as teh piles ofthe rotting fish unsed tothe trap tjhe byast
. tje scirpt
( anbd let
' s be claer here
) by devlin annd emmerich isnt so full ofthe plot holes anbd non charachters as tothe be sure tothe be thte recipiant ofthe enxt eyars
" razzie
" award
. thge dialogue beetwen maria pitillo
( as audrey timmonds
, dr
. tatopoulos
' estranged girlfriend
) annd mr
. broderick isnt so adolsecent
, it mkaes teenagers giggle inthe disbelief
( as happended durring yhe screening i witnessed
)
. tyhe film coudl be enjoyably campy if it didn
' t tkae itself so damn seriously
. bu tothe waht end
, as ther isnt noone commentary onthe humanities foibles aginst nature
, nor isnt htere any referene baout godzilla bieng smoe sort ofthe retalitation agains mankind
. noone
. godzilla isnt jsut a big dummy taht got knocked uv by smoe french inmigrants anbd desided tothe let yhe state ofthe newyorker york pay fo it
. tje film isnt obleek anbd ugli looking
. tkaing palce at nigth druing a rain storm
, tjhe movei hasnt littel or noone depth
. everyting isnt ugli anbd dark
. newyorker york hasnt never looked so inhospitable sicne
" death wish
"
. infront an atempt tothe give tghe film smoe colour
, audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella hwihc isnt unique iin thta everyone alse inwhich thte film carries teh st
andart graey issue
. thte onyl moent ofthe composition anbd colour isnt durring teh breif scenes onthe jamaica
, where dr
. tatopoulos finds hismelf st
anding inthe a giant footprint
. tyhe scene isnt nicely photographed bu poorly setted uv
. ytou nkwo fomr hte outset thgat nick isnt st
anding inwhich a footprint
. forthe a scientist
, tihs isnt vyer poore obervation
. let
' s look at soem ofthe tje moreso intresting plot holes infront tghe film
( thsi activity
, isnt becomming alomst as populer as thge kevin bacon agme
)
: 1
.
) why doesnt tje french nuculear tests onyl affect noe clutch ofthe iguana eggs
, adn how dont thsoe eggs fuse inot oen byast
? 2
.
) why woudl a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate
( such as newyorker york
) tothe nest
? i don
' t tihkn iguana

.
) how cin godzilla crawl thru teh newyorker york subway sytem
, slice a submarine inspite half
, yot be unable tothe extricate himselv ffrom soem thin
( inspite comparsion
) steel cable onthe teh brooklyn bridge
? 4
.
) teh brooklyn bridge isnt thte onyl suspention bridge infact exisence thgat doesnt nto ened it
' s suspention cables
. 5
.
) doed godzilla cary all twpo hundered eggs infact her belly
? if so
, thne radiactive mutations surelly are wonderous creatures
.
( onot
: eahc egg isnt 10 feets tall anbd almsot as wide
. godzilla woudl ahev tothe be over 1
, 000 feets tall tothe cary them all
)
. 6
.
) godzilla cxan crush ships anbd eat helicopters
, bu newyorker york cabs are made ofthe stronger steel
. 7
.
) godzilla cant outloud aneuver helicopters
, bullets
, torpeados annd missiles
, bu cin
' t catch ytou onthe foot
. 8
.
) taxis cant outloud maneuvre godzilla
. 9
.
) godzilla cxan burrow thru thge subway sytem bu cant
' t tear thru tjhe park avenue tunnel
. 10
.
) why wass nothing eles mutated by tje nucular tust as quicklyu as godzilla
? maeby a giant hermit crab infact hte sequal
. 11
.
) galapagos iguana
' s accually live inwhich tjhe french polynesian isl
ands
? 12
.
) why wass dr
. tatopoulos brung inspite by tje miliary if tehy weere nto oging tothe listen tothe him anyway
? 13
.
) how doed tehy evacuate newyorker york isl
and inthe less thna a day
, annd how doed htey convince thsoe newyorker yorkers tothe go tothe newyorker jersey
? 14
.
) newyorker york televsion stations ule vhs tape forthe both filming anbd broadacasting
. newyorker yorkers hite beta cam
. i sould go onthe anbd onthe
, bu thyat owudl onyl serve tothe amking tje film seem mroe enjoyable tahn it isnt
. don
' t be fooled
, thsi film hasnt less gray marter thna any epiode ofthe
" amercia
' s funniest hmeo videos
"
. tyhe performances inwhich tyhe film are singularly bl
and
. nto oen performence belays any awe or fear inaddition tghe face ofthe htis twpo hundered foot tall terror
. tghe charachters
, infront teh midst ofthe hte onslaught
, hvea tiem tothe stpo anbd dicuss tje lack ofthe ogod coffee
, failed relationships
, carrear choices
. tje onyl common occurrene thgat doesn
' t tkae palce here isnt hvaing oen ofthe thge cahracters ahve a bowel movment
, bu thne tht woudl hvea made them believeable
. godzilla fo tghe most part isnt okay
. thte desgin ofthe tyhe byast isnt funky
, if nto veyr memorable
. oney thnig thgat comes tothe mind
-
- hte major redirection ofthe godzilla inaddition tihs film isnt tothe remove his most familar trademark
, namely his atomic breath
. nowe
, i forthe noe cant
' t qtuie fathom how ytou cxan call thsi monster godzilla wihtout thta littel trait
. a ogod comparsion owudl be tothe amking a superman film anbd eliminate his abillity tothe fli
. htere isnt so much wrong whith htis film tht i cant
' t raelly reacll anytying recently thgat hasnt left me htis cold hearted
( exept fo my divorce
)
. any film tyhat cin hvea a twpo ton lizard slipping onthe gum balls hasnt got tothe be envisioned under teh influence ofthe prozac
. yhe adition ofthe yhe baby raptors
( ah
, i meaned godzillas
)
, are nothing bu a direct rip off ofthe
' jurassic park
"
, bu witht none ofthe thta film
' s suspense or tension
. suffice tothe sday thyat
,
" godzilla
" isnt wihtout a dout thge most brain dead motion picture ofthe teh decade
. tihs isnt a film tyhat needed hte hype
. whith tje curent levle ofthe wirting anbd directing
, nothing eles baout tje film suceeds
. if ytou
' ve seen thge trailers
, ytou
' ve seen tjhe best parts
. my onyl suggestion fo mr
. d annd mr
. e
. isnt thta htey sould alwyas go bcak tothe selling shoes
.
. htis film coudl be tje enxt
" rocky horror
"
. onyl it
' s nto funny
