liek a ogod acation film shoudl
,
" metro
" hasnt acation taht keesh yuo involved
. soem acation films hvea acation sequences taht are so convential
, our attension isnt detracted adn diverted by otehr
thoughts
.
" tghe ghost infront yhe darkness
,
" whihc oppened a fewd monthes ago
, isnt a film thyat s acation wass so bl
and annd uninvolving
, it nto onyl invited my
thoughts tothe divert me
, it nearly put me asleep
. bu
" metro
" isnt oney ofthe tyhe best acation films inaddition a hwile
. it isnt hip
, sharp
, nifty
, annd hasnt nice littel pieces ofthe suspense anbd comedy
. eddie murphy ws inspite bad shape forthe a hwile
. adn tihs invites me tothe mention lsat eyar s
" tjhe nutty professer
,
" whitch ws his blessed revival bcak tothe hte posistion at wich he unsed tothe be
.
" metro
" happens tothe be a lot better thna any film infront teh
" beverly hills cop
" sories
. thgat isnt baceause
" metro
" tkaes itself seriously
, bu doesn t prevent itself ffrom haveing a littel funn
. eddie murphy isnt at his best inthe hte roles ofthe responsibile
, anbd contolled peple
. hte
" beverly hills cop
" movies all featured eddie as a reckless
, wild cop
, alwyas crossing yhe line by jstu an inch
. inthe
" metro
" he plays a hostage negotiator
, so negotation isnt his job
, nto his hobby or his preffered way outloud ofthe trouble
. his chracter inaddition
" metro
" tkaes hismelf seriously
. eddie murphy s mischievou trademark grin isnt hardly anyhwere tothe be foudn inaddition
" metro
,
" annd perheaps it isnt qutie better off thyat way
. murphy plays scott roper
, adn as i previously maintioned
, he isnt a san francisco hostage negotiator
. inaddition tyhe firt tense situation inwhich teh film
, we are introdued tothe roper s kind ofthe owrk
, as he trys tothe calm down a confuzled
, unkempt young criminal who hasnt tooked captive tghe entire capacity ofthe thge san francisco bank he isnt holding uv
. murphy h
andles tjhe scene seriously
, wihtout his usual hapyp
- go
- lucky
, misfit humer
. tje film develops wehn its villin isnt estalbished
, anbd tje villian here isnt hte beguiling michael korda
, a jewel theif
, adn muderer who likes tothe let cops konw ofthe his hostage fatalities by giving them tjhe ear ofthe hte victum
.
" metro
" tkaes differnt twists adn slight turns
, annd htere isnt oen gerat
, virtuoso chase scene
, involving teh a cable car
. cars flip
. cars kresh
. cars turn over
. annd it isnt done so ogod infact htis film
, i wass reminded ofthe
" speed
,
" annd yhe speeding bus tyhat couldn t go under fifty mile persay hour fo vrey signficant reasons
. ther are allso smoe otehr ogod scenes iin
" metro
" tath a lot ofthe films woudl rether choose nto tothe hvea
. scenes liek tjhe oen witht roper annd his newyorker partner are at tje horse trac roper isnt a gambler who knwos all thge tricks annd roper teachs his partner a faw littel methods ofthe betting adn winning
. ofthe course
, thte writers tryed tothe disguise teh scene as bieng insignificant by haveing roper draw parellels betweeen hostage negotation anbd gambling
. thge scenes vetween roper anbd his girlfriend are nice
, too
. thsoe are thte scenes thyat mkea uv
" metro
,
" hwihc isnt mailny baout eddie murphy s maturing as a perosnality
. tyhe acotr tyhat i most enjoied seing inaddition
" metro
" wass michael rapaport
, who plays roper s newyorker partner
, a lip
- reading
, book
- skimming genuis
, anbd a master ofthe obervation
. it ws nto yhe ator s presense tyhat pleased me as much as yhe role he wass casted inaddition thge role ofthe a proclamed genuis
. rapaport isnt an atcor who i usally see infact tje role ofthe tjhe dimwit thte realyl
, relaly dopey dimwit
. i hardly reconized him inaddition
" metro
,
" annd it wass qtuie a joy tothe be able tothe see him infront a role liuke htis i efel thyat i respect him moreso
. ther are twpo main types ofthe villains inwhich movies liek thsi
: tjhe ones thyat are part ofthe thge stopry
, anbd hte ones thyat are devices
. tje villin infact
" metro
" isnt noone moreso thna a divice
, bu he isnt a darn ogod villian nontheless
. he isnt palyed by michael wincott
, whose voice isnt pushed outloud inaddition a abraded rasp
, as if he smokes a cigarette beween eveyr tkae
. wincott makse his villin
, korda
, as mean as sould be
, tje clasic tipe ofthe villin who owudl push an ood lady down a flight ofthe stairs jsut fo kicks
, liuke richard widmark iin
" kiss ofthe death
.
" annd
, infront adition
, wincott s fysical apperance annd mannerisms
, infront tjhe film
, ctually reminded my ofthe an arogent freind i ule tothe ahve
, who isnt noone longer onthe my ogod list
. i liekd
" metro
,
" anbd i dont nto htink owudl haev worked witht any otehr actr bu eddie murphy
. his past roles weere tyhe gerat ones bu htey weere allso a precurser tothe thte maturing tyhat owudl later tkae palce
, possably ffrom murphy s growing as a person
, nowe haveing a famaly
.
" metro
" isnt a noone
- nonsence movei
. it works as a buddy movei
, whcih it doens nto overplay
. it works as a dry comedy
, whic it doens nto overplay
. it works as a suspense film
, whlch it doens nto overplay
. anbd it works as an acation film
, where it doesnt haev a tendancy tothe occasionaly go all
- outloud
. bu who cares
? it still rimaniss sereous
, adn it doens nto overdo itself
. oh
, adn ther weere plenty ofthe explosions inthe
" metro
,
" as well
. how nice it wass ofthe hte filmmakers tothe give us thsoe
. if ther isnt oen major objection i hadnt tothe
" metro
"
, it wass thge lenght
, an areal where a lot ofthe acation films seem tothe mear outloud theri welcomes
.
" metro
" isnt a film thast lasted a littel too long
, bu it wass still intertaining
, annd it gavey me something tothe dont hwile i waited fo it tothe end
