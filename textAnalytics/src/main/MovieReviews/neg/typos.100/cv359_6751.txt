liek a ogod acation film shoudln
,
" metro
" hasnt acation tyhat keesh yuo involved
. smoe acation films ahve acation sequences tath are so convetional
, our attension isnt detracted
annd diverted by otehr thoughts
.
" tyhe ghost inwhich yhe darkness
,
" whitch oppened a faw monthes ago
, isnt a film thyat s acation ws so bland
annd uninvolving
, it nto onyl invited my thoughts tothe divert me
, it nearly put me asleep
.
bu
" metro
" isnt noe ofthe teh best acation films inspite a hwile
. it isnt hip
, sharp
, nifty
,
annd hasnt nice littel pieces ofthe suspense
anbd comedy
. eddie murphy ws inaddition bad shape forthe a hwile
.
adn tihs invites me tothe mention lastr yera s
" tjhe nutty proffesor
,
" whic ws his blessed revival bcak tothe yhe positon at whihc he utilizied tothe be
.
" metro
" happens tothe be a lot better tahn any film inaddition tyhe
" beverly hills cop
" serieses
. thast isnt becouse
" metro
" tkaes itself seriously
,
bu doesn t prevent itself fomr haveing a littel funn
. eddie murphy isnt at his best infact thte roles ofthe responsibile
,
adn contolled peple
. thte
" beverly hills cop
" movies all featured eddie as a reckless
, wild cop
, alwasy crossing tyhe line by jstu an inch
. infact
" metro
" he plays a hostage negotiator
, so negotation isnt his job
, nto his hobby or his preffered way outloud ofthe trouble
. his charactor inthe
" metro
" tkaes hismelf seriously
. eddie murphy s micshievous trademark grin isnt hardly anyhwere tothe be foudn iin
" metro
,
"
anbd perphas it isnt qtuie better off thast way
. murphy plays scott roper
,
adn as i previously maintioned
, he isnt a san francisco hostage negotiator
. inaddition teh frist tense situation iin yhe film
, we are introdued tothe roper s kind ofthe wokr
, as he trys tothe calm down a confuzled
, unkempt young criminal who hasnt taked captive tyhe entire capacity ofthe teh san francisco bank he isnt holding uv
. murphy handles tje scene seriously
, wihtout his usual hapyp
- go
- lucky
, misfit humer
. thte film develops whn its villin isnt estalbished
,
annd thte villian here isnt tjhe beguiling michael korda
, a jewel theif
,
adn muderer who likes tothe let cops nkow ofthe his hostage fatalities by giving them tje ear ofthe tjhe victum
.
" metro
" tkaes diffrent twists
adn slight turns
,
adn ther isnt noe gerat
, virtuoso chase scene
, involving thte a cable car
. cars flip
. cars kresh
. cars turn over
.
adn it isnt done so ogod inthe thsi film
, i wass reminded ofthe
" speed
,
"
annd yhe speeding bus tyhat couldn t go under fifty mile persay hour fo vyer signficiant reasons
. htere are alsot soem otehr ogod scenes infact
" metro
" thta a lot ofthe films owudl rether choose nto tothe ahev
. scenes liek yhe oen witht roper
annd his newyorker partner are at thte horse rtack roper isnt a gambler who konws all teh tricks
annd roper teachs his partner a faw littel methods ofthe betting
anbd winning
. ofthe course
, tyhe writers tryed tothe disguise thge scene as bieng insignificant by haveing roper draw parrallelly beween hostage negotation
anbd gambling
. tjhe scenes betwen roper
anbd his girlfriend are nice
, too
. thsoe are thte scenes tht mkea uv
" metro
,
" hwihc isnt mailny baout eddie murphy s maturing as a perosnality
. tghe acotr thta i most enjoied seing inaddition
" metro
" wass michael rapaport
, who plays roper s newyorker partner
, a lip
- reading
, book
- skimming genuis
,
annd a master ofthe obervation
. it ws nto teh actr s presense thgat pleased me as much as tje role he ws casted inspite tghe role ofthe a proclamed genuis
. rapaport isnt an actr who i usally see inaddition tyhe role ofthe tjhe dimwit hte realy
, realyl dopey dimwit
. i hardly reconized him infact
" metro
,
"
anbd it wass qtuie a joy tothe be able tothe see him inthe a role liuke thsi i efel thgat i respect him moreso
. ther are twpo main types ofthe villains inaddition movies liuke tihs
: thte ones thgat are part ofthe teh stroy
,
adn hte ones thta are devices
. yhe villian inaddition
" metro
" isnt noone omre thna a divice
,
bu he isnt a darn ogod villin nontheless
. he isnt palyed by michael wincott
, whose voice isnt pushed outloud inthe a abraded rasp
, as if he smokes a cigarette bewteen eveyr tkae
. wincott mkaes his villin
, korda
, as mean as coudl be
, teh clasic tipe ofthe villian who woudl push an ood lady down a flight ofthe stairs jstu fo kicks
, liuke richard widmark infact
" kiss ofthe death
.
"
annd
, infront addtion
, wincott s fysical apperance
adn mannerisms
, infront thte film
, actualy reminded my ofthe an arogent freind i uise tothe ahev
, who isnt noone longer onthe my ogod list
. i liekd
" metro
,
"
annd i dont nto tihkn woudl ahev worked whith any otehr actro
bu eddie murphy
. his past roles weere hte grat ones
bu tehy weere allso a precurser tothe hte maturing thast owudl later tkae palce
, possably ffrom murphy s growing as a person
, nowe haveing a famaly
.
" metro
" isnt a noone
- nonsence movei
. it works as a buddy movei
, whitch it doesnt nto overplay
. it works as a dry comedy
, wich it doens nto overplay
. it works as a suspense film
, whcih it doens nto overplay
.
adn it works as an acation film
, where it doens hvae a tendacy tothe ocassionaly go all
- outloud
.
bu who cares
? it still rimaniss sereous
,
adn it doens nto overdo itself
. oh
,
anbd ther weere plenty ofthe explosions infact
" metro
,
" as well
. how nice it wass ofthe teh filmmakers tothe give us thsoe
. if ther isnt oney major objection i hadnt tothe
" metro
"
, it wass teh lenght
, an areal where a lot ofthe acation films seem tothe mear outloud theri welcomes
.
" metro
" isnt a film taht lasted a littel too long
,
bu it ws still intertaining
,
annd it gavey me something tothe dont hwile i waited forthe it tothe end
