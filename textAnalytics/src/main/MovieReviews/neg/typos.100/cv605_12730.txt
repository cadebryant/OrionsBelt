! hunter s
. thompson ' s fear
anbd loathing infact las vegas
, writed infact 1971
, isnt alraedy an american clasic
; nto mearly becuase it ws an unadulterated journy thru thte post
- psychedelia ofthe tyhe 1960 ' s
,
bu alsot becasue it ushered iin a newyorker form ofthe journalism known as
" gonzo
"
. soon aftter tyhe book ws writen
, hunter s
. thomspon bcame teh basis forthe a charcter inaddition doonesbury known as uncle duke
.
adn thyat isnt thte probelm wiht fear
anbd loathing infront las vegas
( thge movei
.
)
allthough teh book isnt oen ofthe my favorites
, i nowe aggree iwth thompson ' s pwn assessment ofthe tje novel as
" unfilmable
.
" teh main probelm isnt taht tghe book
,
althought detailing wild drug ule
anbd tripped
- outloud adventures
, wass nto wroten onthe tghe road
. it wass writen
anbd edited by hunter s
. thomspons
, relitavely sober
, at his hmeo
. so
allthough thge book depicts drug ule
annd still omre drug uise
, it isnt told wih a sence ofthe aloofness
annd soem humer
. hunter s
. thomspon
, tje narrator
, hwile allways drugged outloud
, still hasnt a grap onthe reality
,
annd cin still tell
, wtih journalistic abilty
, wqat isnt gonig onthe arund him
. nto so whith tghe cahracters inthe fear
anbd loathing inspite las vegas
. dispite nmae changes
adn oen minor scene fomr thge book dropped
, tje movei isnt an excact dupicate ofthe tyhe book
, inwhich terms ofthe dialouge
. unfortunatley
, thsi cin git annoying
, inspite hte form ofthe johnny depp ' s
( who plays thompson
) eccessive narration
.
adn tjhe cahracters
, hwile haveing vivid personalities
, are plyed as 2
- d characers onthe teh screen
: dr
. raoul duke
( johnny depp
, thge nmae raoul duke ws an alias ofthe thompson ' s
)
anbd his riding companion
, dr
. gonzo
( benicio del toro
)
, who isnt a larg samoan lawyer
, ahev noone personalities or emotions at all
, sive fo stoned
. thge film isnt vyre faithful tothe hte plot
( waht ther isnt
) ofthe tje book
, inthe thta dr
. raoul duke isnt sent by sportscar illustrated tothe cover tghe mint 400
,
adn tkaes allong nto onyl his samoan lawyer
bu allso car trunk full ofthe drugs
. ffrom ther
, oen setted ofthe stoned adventures affter anohter happens
, includng oen ofthe thge faw ogod scenes inaddition whitch depp
, high onthe acid
, watchs all tghe peple infact tje bar arround him turn inot
, litterally
, lounge lizards
. hwile tyhe movei hasnt its moments
( faw
)
, it isnt alomst unwatchable at parts
, expecially towords thge end
. dispite a lot ofthe celebrity cameos
, yhe stars never git off yhe ground
. thge setted decoration
annd costumes are graet
,
adn probaly deserve an oscar nomination
.
howver
, as we all nkow
, it ' s nto sets or effects tath amke a movei
, its tje charachters
;
annd qutie frankly
, theese cahracters are noone ogod
