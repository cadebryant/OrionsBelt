! hunter s
. thompson
' s fear adn loathing inaddition las vegas
, writen inwhich 1971
, isnt alread an american clasic
; nto mearly beacuse it ws an unadulterated journy thru yhe post
- psychedelia ofthe thge 1960
' s
, bu alsot becouse it ushered inaddition a newyorker form ofthe journalism known as
" gonzo
"
. soon aftter thge book ws writen
, hunter s

( tjhe movei
.
) all
though yhe book isnt noe ofthe my favorites
, i nowe agreing withthe thompson
' s pwn assessment ofthe yhe novel as
" unfilmable
.
" thte main probelm isnt tath hte book
,
al
thought detailing wild drug ule annd tripped
- outloud adventures
, ws nto writen onthe yhe road
. it ws writed adn edited by hunter s
. thomspons
, realitvely sober
, at his hmeo
. so altho tjhe book depicts drug uise anbd still mroe drug uise
, it isnt told wih a sence ofthe aloofness anbd smoe humer
. hunter s
. thomspon
, teh narrator
, hwile alwyas drugged outloud
, still hasnt a grap onthe reality
, anbd cin still tell
, iwth journalistic ablity
, whta isnt oging onthe arund him
. nto so wih thte charactors infront fear anbd loathing infront las vegas
. dispite nmae changes anbd noe minor scene fomr tje book dropped
, yhe movei isnt an excact dupicate ofthe tyhe book
, infact terms ofthe dialouge
. unfourtunately
, tihs cin git annoying
, iin tyhe form ofthe johnny depp
' s
( who plays thompson
) eccessive narration

. hwile yhe movei hasnt its moments
( faw
)
