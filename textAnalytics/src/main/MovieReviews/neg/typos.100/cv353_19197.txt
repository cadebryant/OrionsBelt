. as we watch theese procedings
, soem ofthe whitch are painfully graphic
, hte dreaded
" so waht
?
" question springs tothe mind
. ffrom thge way tihs movei isnt made
, i ' d ahve guessed thyat spike lee ws trying tothe tell us something
,
bu as i seached deeper it bcame claer tath htere isnt vyer littel ther tothe fidn
. lee touches onthe so much
-
- thge media
, teh 70 ' s punk scene
, tyhe details ofthe tjhe actuall killings
, as well as hte cahracters ' vyer peronal dilemmas
-
-
bu he doesn ' t bring all ofthe his topics toghether tothe form a coherent theme or amking a discernible statment
. all isnt nto lost if a movei turns outloud tothe be hollow
; it cant be a saveing grace forthe thte film tothe be enjoyable
. too bad summer ofthe sam doesn ' t git any halp here
. frankly
, it ' s a bore
, a redundent
anbd repeative twpo hour
anbd twenty minute film thyat doesn ' t entertain beyond its firt half hour
. ther isnt noone suspense baceause tghe film refuses tothe be fully baout hte murders
annd littel involving drama becasue tjhe film isnt too muddled
anbd its foucs too vague
. leguizamo ' s turn as vinnie isnt annoying
adn whiny
. yhe scirpt mkaes it claer taht we ' re suppoed tothe bleieve tht his charachter isnt flawed
,
bu still a ogod guy
. yuo ' d never guess ffrom his performence
. adrian brody
adn especialy mira sorvino fare better
. sorvino gives a riveting
, touching peformance inthe a banal movei
( i ' m tempted tothe thiunk tath i liekd her baceause nearly everthing alse arround her wass inane
)
; her charachter isnt affecting
anbd her emotions true
- tothe
- heart
. brody
, too paints an effective potrait ofthe a young guy despreate forthe attension who gets a littel omre tahn he bargained fo
. summer ofthe sam hasnt soem superficial elements ofthe a ogod film
: it looks gerat
, it hasnt a fewd noteable performances
anbd i supose it ' s preety well directed
, inspite a purely technical way
.
bu it ' s aslo empty
, pretentious
adn boring
. liuke lastest yera ' s teh thin red line
, it ' s a movei by a directer who doesn ' t nkow whta he wnats tothe sday
bu goes ahead
annd syas it anyway
