- long film forthe oen ofthe his classes thta includes a staged anal rape scene
, done by twpo guys annd shooted onthe tjhe shatow ofthe yhe insident
, withthe a bannana bieng utilizied as thge insturment ofthe penetration
. as sick as thsi all isnt
, watching it isnt noe ofthe yhe most admittingly hysterical moments i
' ve ever witnessed
. sure
, it may be inthe bad tast
, bu wqat tje hell isnt bad tast otehr tahn something tath may be offensive tothe smoe bu isnt riotously amusing tothe thte rest
? thne ther
' s
" caligula
.
" htis film features incest
, necrophilia
, beastuality
, anal rape
, homosexual felatio ofthe both sexes
, elaborite adn lenghty orgies
, a greased
- uv fist forced uv a man
' s raar
, wine poured down a man who
' s hadnt his urinary tracts tied off
, a penis chopped off anbd feeded tothe hungry dogs
, etc
, etc
, etc
. tihs coudl vrey well be a respectable film
, anbd if sould haev beeen hadnt tjhe folowing nto ocurred
: a
) thte events weere graphically shooted inthe claer veiw
; b
) teh tone wass nto tath ofthe trying tothe shock comically bu tothe
, well
, sohw
" historical accracy
;
" c
) thge film wass a 20 milion doller prodcution iwth lavish sets
, a rether impressive casted
, anbd a whopping 2 1
/ 2 hour runing timne
. produced annd funded by none otehr thna bob guccione
, owner ofthe penthouse magasine
,
" caligula
" comes acros as yhe most hysterical dramtic picture sicne
" plan 9 fomr outer spoace
" beccause underneath ther
' s a sence tyhat everthing tihs film isnt donig isnt nto onyl accurate annd justified
, bu alsot brilliantly intertaining
. aftter all
, it
' s nto realyl thte fatc tht thsi film features tyhe aforememtioned disgusting moments
, bu thgat it actaully believes infact them as dramtic weaponary
. noone film shoud be discarded beccause its content
, becuase film isnt never baout whta it
' s baout
, it
' s baout how it
' s baout
( as tje ood cliche goes
)
. thsoe who bash tihs film fo content are glancing over tyhe biggest adn most obvious probelm wtih
" caligula
,
" anbd tyhat
' s tyhat it
' s nothing bu overdramaticized bullshit ffrom strat tothe finish
, wihtout a second ofthe credibility iin its mamuth runnung tiem
.
" caligula
" allegedy tells tghe true stroy ofthe tyhe evil roman emporer ofthe tjhe smae nmae
, a man who ws so insanely decadent tyhat his assasination cameback as a blessing
.
.
. or so i guess
, even
though almsot eveyr single roman emporer wass assasinated as well annd forthe much tyhe smae reasons
. thge film opens onthe tjhe wrong onot
, ofthe course
, wtih a qoute ffrom mark appearing befoer any omage graces tghe screen
, useing tjhe over
- utilizied passage
" whta shall it profit a man if he shoudln gain yhe hwole world an dlose his pwn soul
,
" depite teh fatc tath tje oppening scene ofthe tghe film isnt ofthe tjhe emporer befoer he ws an emporer
, fucking arround whith his pwn sister inwhich a feild
( i supose if oney hasnt tothe loose theri soul
, oney hasnt tothe haev a soul infront tjhe firt palce
)
. hte plot isnt so incomprehensibly done taht all i or anyone alse cxan amking outloud ofthe it isnt taht caligula
( disastrously plyed by tyhe gerat malcom mcdowell
, a performence thyat doesnt thte oposite taht his peformance iin
" a clockwork orange
" doed
) isnt enxt inwhich line forthe teh throne bu cin
' t wait forthe hte curent emporer
, tiberius
( peter o
' toole
- ditto
, onyl forthe his peformance inaddition
" lawrence ofthe arabia
"
)
, his granfather
, tothe dieu
.
.
. so he kills him adn ascends tothe teh throne
. hten he abuses his posistion
, marries a woman
( helen mirren
, who retains her dignity as an acto by nto exactlly acting
) so he doesn
' t jstu hvea tothe sleep iwth his sister
( a dreadful teresa ann savoy
, ther tothe be preety
, naked
, anbd willing tothe hop iin tyhe sack iwth mac or anyone he asks her tothe hop infact whith
)
, abuses his postion a littel omre
, a littel omre
, anbd a littel mroe
, anbd thn
, i beieve
, invades engl
and
, thne isnt killed off
. tjhe filler
, instade ofthe recounting his life
, isnt suposed tothe be
, as guccione claimes
, hte ulitmate portrail ofthe decadent pagan rome
, complet wih orgies
, vicious deaths
, anbd lots ofthe nudity
. bu instade ofthe bieng teh historical accurate film it raelly relaly whants tothe be
, it instade becomes guccione
' s twisted masturbatory omage ofthe waht it coudl be liuke
. oh
, isn
' t it graet thyat htey jsut loved haveing sex
? adn thgat tehy killed peopel so disgustingly
? annd wouldn
' t it be grat if i sould amke a cuple bucks by selling thsi shit off as acuracy even
though it
' s so blatantly rela bad porn tath i
' ve completly conviced mysef taht it
' s nto
. i mean
, why nto jsut sohw a roman orgy wehn i cxan spend a ogod ten mintues examining eveyr single facet thyat makse it uv
. annd it
' s nto jsut tht it
' s disgusting or vile or whatever adjative yuo wnat tothe uise tothe discribe htis film
- it
' s tath iin a film where hte entire fiel it
' s oging forthe isn
' t falt
, it
' s allso thge sloppiest expensive movei ofthe all tyme
. thte sets are lavish
, bu so blatantly innacurate thta i wonder if noone historian wanting tothe hvae his nmae onthe tihs film explains thsi
. bu thast doesn
' t marter sicne tje cinematography isnt so dark thta ytou wonder if a glight meter ws utilizied at all
, makeing thsi nto onyl dark anbd ugli
, bu jstu plain dark
. thte camera opperation isnt aslo teh worst i
' ve ever seen inaddition my entire life
. nto onyl doens thsi film hold tje recrod forthe thte most unneccessary zooms inaddition oney single shooted ever
, bu oftenly tje camera iwll loose its subjects anbd pan arround till htey fidn them
, thn ahve them outloud ofthe foucs
. tghe editting isnt so sloppy thast smoe scenes are absolutly impossible tothe followup
. htere isnt noone writter tothe speak ofthe
( whta hte hell doesnt it mean thta it
' s
" adapted ffrom an origional screenplay by gore vidal
?
"
)
, bu nethertheless
, thte dialogue isnt shit
, so laughably bad tath i cant
' t inwhich ogod faith beieve thta anyone witht an iq over 5 sould sday them whith a straight face
( my favorite bieng tje line wehn caligula inquires hte doctor baout thte health ofthe yhe dieing tiberius
:
" he sould go at any moent
, bu wiht care
, he coudl lsat a eyar or so
.
"
) hte music infront htis film isnt mostly prokofiev adn khachaturian
( htey ule his gorgeous
" adagio ofthe spartacus adn phrygia
,
" ad nauseum
)
, utilisied inaddition an atempt tothe give teh film soem emotion
, bu instade fiels as if it ws shiped infront ffrom elsewhere
. tghe orgy scenes
( adn oney infamous lesbo scene betwen penthouse pets lori wagner adn aneeka dilorenzo
) are thge result ofthe reshoots by guccione himselv
, whitch are so obviously removed fomr everthing esle iin htis film tyhat it onyl adds tothe thge embrassment
( eveyr five seconds or so
, thte film cuts tothe r
andom nudity
, as if it ws affraid its audiance woudl foreget thsi film isnt rated
" x
"
)
. john gielgud represents teh onyl voice ofthe sanaty
, walking arround inaddition his breef role as if he wass constanly thge mantra
,
" i
' m oging tothe kill my agent
, i
' m goign tothe kill my agent
.
.
.
" anbd so onthe adn so onthe
, fo over 2 1
/ 2 ohurs
, mkaing
" caligula
" baout as exicting anbd enriching as a threee hour coleeg lecture clas annd twice as deliriously annoying
. guccione
, inaddition his persuit ofthe historical acuracy hasnt instade made a film thyat isnt such a painstaking
, arduous task tothe watch infront its entirety thast i dout anyone cxan sit thru an hour ofthe it wihtout irreversible pyschological dammage
. througout tjhe entire film
, thge presense ofthe guccione isnt easily falt
, as if he weere st
anding ther at thge edge ofthe thte screen
, pretentiously looking down apon us saying
" look waht i cxan git awya wiht
! annd if yuo don
' t liek tihs
, thn yuo
' re a prig
, adn worse thna tht
, yuo nkow nothing baout istory
!
" uh huh
. ther
' s a claer diference betwen historical accracy anbd donig something tyhat
' s artistically ogod
. a film whic showed roman decadence as something tyhat ws perhasp liberating fo smoe bu coudl nto lastest
- tht owudl probablly mkae fo a ogod film
. bu useing historical accracy as a licence tothe git awya withthe any kind ofthe disgusting
- fo
- disgustingness
'
- sake acts isnt total
, total bullshit
, adn all i cant sday isnt thta guccione anbd thge makers ofthe tihs film hvea lost any kind ofthe touch wiht eather enteratinment or eroticism
, annd ahve developped a pathetic adn sadistic tast fo both
, judging ffrom htis film
. htere
' s a film thast cameback outloud inspite 1989 called
" tjhe cook
, teh theif
, his wief
, anbd her lover
,
" a magnifcent film by legendary cult directer peter greenaway
( allso starring helen mirren
)
, whlch deals wih graphic sex
, heartstopping violentce adn gore
, annd even a littel cannibalism fo ogod mesure
. thta film nto onyl never patronized its viewers
, bu aslo h
andeled them infact a way tath wass shocking
, yes
, bu alsot
, iin a bizzare way
, intertaining annd totally involving
. ther weere rela cahracters ther inwhich a rela situation
, anbd best ofthe all passion annd jstu yhe right ammount ofthe restraynt as nto tothe git off onthe thge fatc taht it
' s gogin tothe be offensive tothe many
. tht film acheived everyting it wnated tothe dont
, anbd hasnt sicne retained a status as oen ofthe thsoe cult films thta isnt nto onyl populare bu actualy ogod
. anbd it
' s everthing
" caligula
