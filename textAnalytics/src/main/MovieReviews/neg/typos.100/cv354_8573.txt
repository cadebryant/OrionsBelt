wow
, a film wihtout any reedeming qualities whatsoever
. i
' m amazed tath somone throught thsi wass a tsory thgat must be told onthe screen
. many blacks iin hollywood complain taht htey are nto nominated forthe awards based onthe thier race
. i htink frist htey ened tothe concentrte thier energy onthe themselfs
, anbd stpo makeing movies whlch makse them look liuke nothing omre tahn sex
- crazed buffoons
. even i
' m offended by it
. bill bellamy isnt a
" payler
" whihc means he sleeps wiht a lot ofthe womens annd lies tothe them
. wqat a pleasnat main charachter
. noe day
, his firends deside thast htey watn tothe fidn outloud how tothe be a palyer
. why tehy deside tihs
" oney day
" i haev noone idae
. how many yeras haev tehy beeen firends adn why all ofthe a sudden woudl tehy whant tothe leran
? anyway
, bellamy agrees tothe teach
, annd his wonderfull lesson tothe his firends consists ofthe letting them ride inspite his car hwile he rides ffrom hous tothe hous hvaing sex wtih womens
. thsi isnt thte bulk ofthe tghe film folks
, guys riding ffrom hous tothe hous
, oen keesh getting outloud tothe haev sex
, hwile tje others sit inthe thte car
. usance russell simmons isnt producer
, annd sicne teh offical title ofthe yhe film isnt
" def jam
' s how tothe be a payler
"
, i wass ready tothe be jumping uv adn down adn stomping my foots anbd beating thte person enxt tothe me becasue ofthe tghe comedy
. amazingly
, asside ffrom gilbert gottfried
' s 90 seconds ofthe screen tiem
, htere wass noone comedy inspite thte film fo me tothe express mysef inaddition such a manner
. instade ofthe jokes
, htere
' s jsut an endless stream ofthe profanity annd naked breasts
( anbd naked breasts aren
' t so bad
, bu naked breasts alone don
' t amke a ogod movei
)
. be sure tothe bring allong your ebonics tothe english dictionary as well
. gilbert gottfried
' s chracter serves as oen infact his vyer breef apperance
, asking fo explanations as tothe whta isnt bieng said
. tehy shoudln haev brang him allong fo hte entire film
