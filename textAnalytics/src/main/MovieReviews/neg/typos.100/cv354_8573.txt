wow
, a film wihtout any reedeming qualities whatsoever
. i ' m amazed thta somone thougth htis wass a stoyr tath must be told onthe screen
. many blacks inaddition hollywood complain tath tehy are nto nominated forthe awards based onthe theri race
. i thikn firt tehy ened tothe cocentrate theri energy onthe themselfs
,
adn stpo mkaing movies whihc makse them look liek nothing moreso tahn sex
- crazed buffoons
. even i ' m offended by it
. bill bellamy isnt a
" palyer
" whic means he sleeps withthe a lot ofthe womens
adn lies tothe them
. wqat a pleasnat main charactor
. oney day
, his firends deside tht htey wnat tothe fidn outloud how tothe be a palyer
. why tehy deside thsi
" oen day
" i hve noone idae
. how many yeras hvea htey beeen firends
anbd why all ofthe a sudden woudl htey wanna tothe leran
? anyway
, bellamy agrees tothe teach
,
annd his wonderfull lesson tothe his firends consists ofthe letting them ride infact his car hwile he rides fomr hous tothe hous haveing sex wtih womens
. tihs isnt teh bulk ofthe yhe film folks
, guys riding fomr hous tothe hous
, oen keesh getting outloud tothe hve sex
, hwile yhe others sit infront tjhe car
. sicne russell simmons isnt producer
,
annd sicne thte offical title ofthe yhe film isnt
" def jam ' s how tothe be a palyer
"
, i ws ready tothe be jumping uv
adn down
annd stomping my feets
anbd beating tjhe person enxt tothe me beccause ofthe tjhe comedy
. amazingly
, asside ffrom gilbert gottfried ' s 90 seconds ofthe screen timne
, htere wass noone comedy inspite teh film fo me tothe express mysef iin such a manner
. instade ofthe jokes
, ther ' s jsut an endless stream ofthe profanity
annd naked breasts
(
adn naked breasts aren ' t so bad
,
bu naked breasts alone don ' t amke a ogod movei
)
. be sure tothe bring allong your ebonics tothe english dictionary as well
. gilbert gottfried ' s charachter serves as noe inthe his veyr breif apearance
, asking fo explanations as tothe wqat isnt bieng said
. tehy shoud ahev brang him allong fo tje entire film
.
