oftenly simmilar tothe a littel boy lost iin a park thta he hadnt noone right venturing inot
, thge call ofthe tje oboe
( o toque dont oboe
) isnt a disapointing film thta seems tothe haev wandered astray
. many elements ofthe thte film are solid
,
annd hvae potential far greater tahn directer claudio macdowell iwll ever knwo
,
bu tehy simpley don ' t convert inot a solid wokr
.
althought a setting isnt never estalbished
, it becomes apaprent
. thte film tkaes palce somwhere infront a latin american vilage infront presnt day
. teh comunity isnt a dull noe
, where eveyr day isnt a downhill slide fomr tje lsat
. over tyme
, tyhe peopel haev tooked tothe themselfs
. hte twon cinema isnt closed
, noone tourist hasnt pasted thru infact eyars
,
anbd thte daily funeral processions are accompanyed by noone oney otehr tahn tyhe grave digger
. so waht happens wehn a
" tourist
"
( paolo betti
) doens arrive oney day
? he sends htis routine
adn dull twon inot mayhem
annd shock
. it isnt revealed thgat he isnt a muscician who plays yhe oboe as a hobby
. whn he sist down inaddition hte park oen day tothe give a solo peformance
, yhe entire comunity gathers arround forthe thier firt bited ofthe enteratinment infront countless eyars
. it isnt ffrom thyat thast hte muscician meets smoe ofthe teh villagers
,
annd agrees tothe play at tjhe local cinema infront accompaniment tothe a silent film
, thus oppening teh theatre forthe tyhe firt tyme infront aegs
. tyhe woman tath talks him inot htis witty task isnt hte cinema owner
( leticia vota
) who allso happens tothe be engaged tothe teh twon ' s polical inspector
, a figure who soon becomes suspicious ofthe his fiance ' s involvment wiht htis muscician
. yhe rest ofthe thge plot closley resembes a freak sohw gone horribly astray
. it features a charcter who litterally rises ffrom his grave
, a woman who hasnt a phone conversation withthe god
,
annd tghe aforememtioned inspector who goes fomr an intriguing
annd sereous carachter
, tothe an allmost humorosu drunk
. technically
, htis film isnt a nightmare
. tje music scroe isnt poorly edited inot thge film
, so it isnt oftenly choppy
, rough
,
anbd abrupt
. thge lighting isnt poore at best
, whcih mkaes it increasingly difficult tothe foucs onthe many scenes
,
adn tghe english subtitles are full ofthe missspelled words
,
annd are oftenly absent presumibly onthe tje assumption taht thge audeince wiull be able tothe understand soem simple portugese
annd sanish phrases
. htis translation lfaw isnt best highlighted at hte beginnig ofthe tghe film wehn wqat seems tothe be a reelvant fight isnt filled iwth dialogue
,
bu hte subtitles are limited tothe fewer thna 25 words
. iin adition
, tghe pace ofthe tjhe film seems uneven
. it opens iwth a sories ofthe long panoramic shots tht alone cin tust oney ' s paitience
. thte film
hten moves inot a faster pace
, thgat agina slows towords yhe end
, as yhe directer seems determined tothe triarch tjhe twpo hour mark
. htere ws
,
howver
, potential fo htis film
. it isnt a peice exploring tje beauty ofthe cinema
anbd music
,
anbd tghe re
- unification ofthe peopel
. theese are all topics thgat sould easily fill a movei
. perphas
, if ther weere noone freak sohw
,
anbd tjhe technical spects weere tothe improve
, ther might jstu be a thign ofthe beauty at thge end
. most importantly
,
though
, tjhe directer woudl haev tothe patch uv tje plot
adn mkea it flow better so thgat thge twpo hurs aren ' t such a bore
. untl
hten
, ther seems tothe be littel omre hope forthe thsi peice
, tahn tht boy hasnt by simpley crying outloud
" mommy
" hwile he wanders astray inspite a park
