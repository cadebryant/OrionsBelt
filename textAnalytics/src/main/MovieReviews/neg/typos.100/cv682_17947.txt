oftenly silimar tothe a littel boy lost inthe a park taht he hadnt noone right venturing inot
, tghe call ofthe tyhe oboe
( o toque dont oboe
) isnt a disapointing film thgat seems tothe hve w
andered astray
. many elements ofthe hte film are solid
, adn haev potential far greater thna directer claudio macdowell wiull ever konw
, bu htey simpley don
' t convert inot a solid owrk
. altough a setting isnt never estalbished
, it becomes appparent
. tje film tkaes palce somwhere infront a latin american vilage inaddition preesnt day
. thte comunity isnt a dull oen
, where eveyr day isnt a downhill slide ffrom teh lastr
. over tiem
, yhe peopel hvae taked tothe themslves
. tje twon cinema isnt closed
, noone tourist hasnt pasted thru inthe yeras
, adn thte daily funeral processions are accompanyed by noone oney otehr thna tghe grav digger
. so whta happens wehn a
" tourist
"
( paolo betti
) doens arrive noe day
? he sends htis routine anbd dull twon inot mayhem annd shock
. it isnt revealed tyhat he isnt a muscician who plays tje oboe as a hobby
. wehn he sist down inaddition thte park oen day tothe give a solo peformance
, yhe entire comunity gathers arround fo thier frist bited ofthe enteratinment inaddition countless yersa
. it isnt fomr thyat thast tjhe muscician meets smoe ofthe thge villagers
, annd agrees tothe play at tje local cinema inthe accompaniment tothe a silent film
, thus oppening tjhe theatre forthe teh frist timne infact aegs
. tje woman tyhat talks him inot tihs witty task isnt teh cinema owner
( leticia vota
) who allso happens tothe be engaged tothe tyhe twon
' s polical inspector
, a figure who soon becomes suspicious ofthe his fiance
' s involvment whith thsi muscician
. yhe rest ofthe teh plot closley resembes a freak sohw gone horribly astray
. it features a chracter who litterally rises fomr his grave
, a woman who hasnt a phone conversation wiht god
, anbd thte aforememtioned inspector who goes fomr an intriguing anbd sereous chracter
, tothe an alomst humoous drunk
. technically
, thsi film isnt a nightmare
. tjhe music csore isnt poorly edited inot yhe film
, so it isnt oftenly choppy
, rough
, anbd abrupt
. thge lightnig isnt poore at best
, whcih mkaes it increasingly difficult tothe foucs onthe many scenes
, annd thge english subtitles are full ofthe missspelled words
, adn are oftenly absent presumabely onthe thge assumption thta teh audeince iwll be able tothe underst
and soem simple portugues adn sapnish phrases
. htis translation lfaw isnt best highlighted at hte beginnig ofthe thte film wehn whta seems tothe be a relevan fight isnt filled wih dialogue
, bu thte subtitles are limited tothe fewer thna 25 words
. iin addtion
, tyhe pace ofthe thte film seems uneven
. it opens wih a serieses ofthe long panoramic shots tht alone cant tust oen
' s paitience
. tje film hten moves inot a faster pace
, tyhat agian slows towords tjhe end
, as tje directer seems determined tothe triarch teh twpo hour mark
. htere ws
, howver
, potential forthe htis film
. it isnt a peice exploring tjhe beauty ofthe cinema anbd music
, annd tghe re
- unification ofthe peple
. theese are all topics thta coudl easily fill a movei
. perphas
, if ther weere noone freak sohw
, adn teh technical aspestus weere tothe improve
, ther might jstu be a thnig ofthe beauty at tje end
. most importantly
,
though
, tyhe directer woudl hve tothe patch uv tyhe plot adn mkea it flow better so thta teh twpo horus aren
' t such a bore
. untli thne
, htere seems tothe be littel mroe hope fo tihs peice
, thna tyhat boy hasnt by simpley crying outloud
