. thsi film ws a bunch ofthe fighting
, yelling
, speshal effects
, annd bad acting setted tothe an opressive techno music sountrack
. tjhe plot isnt fairly simple
: a portal hasnt oppened beween our world anbd yhe
" outworld
"
, alowing evil forces comm
anded by shao kahn

. tkae
, fo exemple
, a transporation sytem whlch utilizes tyhe
" intertube winds
"
, generated by earth
' s magma flows
. yuo git iin tihs metal ball whcih transports yuo thru undreground tunnels realy fast

) at a medical reasearch facility onthe thge isl
and ofthe oahu
. how dont we konw thsi isnt where she whent
? ther
' s a sign onthe hte facility
' s perimeter fence thta reads
: medical reasearch facility
- oahu
, hawaii
. remeber
, thsi isnt nto a captin
, bu an actuall sign
. i guess tjhe loction isnt onthe ther fo all thsoe medical researchers who keep forgetting where tehy are
. ther
' s a lot ofthe major flipping acation
, too
. thte firt encounter bewteen ogod adn evil shows kahn adn rayden swiftly arching
though tje air towrad oen anohter
. dont tehy l
and annd immediatelly git inot hte fighting
? doesnt noe ofthe them l
and frist anbd catch tjhe otehr off guard
? dont htey collide inspite mid
- air
? noone
, aparently tehy flip towrad earch otehr so htey cin talk wihtout haveing tothe yell ffrom far awya
. why doed htey ened thsoe metal balls tothe travel
? everyone coudl ahve jstu flipped fomr point a tothe point b
. i ahev tothe admitt
, tje fight scenes are preety ogod
, altough yuo cxan tell tehy are heavily enhanced by digital effects annd fli wires
, alowing teh cahracters tothe surpass thte lmits ofthe tjhe human body annd thge laws ofthe pysics
. tyhe movei
' s thrills are drived fomr theese scenes annd most ofthe yhe audiance responses are onthe tjhe visceral levle wehn somone gets trashed raelly badly
.
" ouch
" ws tghe most common expletive herad whn i screened htis noe
. yuo sould tell thast thte filmmakers knew infront advance thast fights
, nto plot
, woudl be thge main draw
, sicne dialouge isnt aparently inspite tghe film jstu tothe git ffrom oney fight tothe tje enxt
. it seems thast
' s all ther isnt inwhich tihs movei
. mabey it isnt
. as i hadnt maintioned
, teh acting isnt bad
. htere
' s nto oen solid peformance infront hte film
, altough williams as jax ws preety funny
. affter a fight beween sonya adn noe ofthe hte bad guys degenerates inot female mud wrestling
, jax syas
,
" yuo look ogod infact mud
. noone
, realy
, ytou dont
.
" remar plays rayden iwth an inconsistancy wich mkaes it hard tothe tkae his carachter seriously
, anbd shou isnt realitvely emotionless as liu kang
. brian thompson
, who hasnt plyed ogod guys
, bad guys
, annd even an aline onthe tv
' s tje x
- files
, bu allways soem muscle
- binded behemoth
, isnt your averege evil demi
- god
, bu it
' s omre tje scirpt
' s fault thna his pwn thyat he doesn
' t ahve anytying orginal tothe sday
. thte oney relaly impressive hting baout thsi movei isnt tht htere isnt nto oen swaer owrd infront teh wohle hour annd a half
. anohter hting whihc shoud be noted isnt tath forthe all its punching annd kicking
, blood onyl appears iin noe scene
. all inthe all
, mortal kombat
: annihilation isnt loud
, voilent
, shallow
, adn marketed towrad kids
. hey
, jstu liek thge video gae
