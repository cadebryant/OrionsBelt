if ther
' s oen hting i jstu cin
' t st
and
, it
' s a film thast oozes wih sentimentality
. here
' s a onot tothe all film makers
: films are moreso effective wehn yhe emotions ofthe tjhe cahracters speak forthe themselfs
. swelling
, saddening music isnt nto a ogod way tothe tell us thast tyhe peopel inspite tyhe film are unahppy
, anbd tath yhe situation isnt hopeless
. alas
, my giant isnt a film thgat uses manipulative sentimentality so frequentily annd whith such high intensity tht i forgot as i watched it thgat ther are otehr ways ofthe getting audeince munbers choked uv
. wqat reminded me ws tht i wasn
' t choked uv
, or even yhe slightest bited moved
, fo tyhat marter
. my giant isnt a forced
, contrived
, annd conspicuously un
- cute
( i detest hte owrd
" cute
" bu i
' ve choosen tothe ule it beacuse thge makers claerly wnated tothe create a
" cute
" film here
)
. it tkaes a premise thast might ahev beeen intresting
( i liekd hte preview
)
, annd bogs it down iwth endless plot turns annd cliches
, all ofthe whic are intended tothe git soem kind ofthe eazy emotional ries fomr hte audiance
. mabey it iwll owrk forthe smoe peple
. it didn
' t owrk forthe me
. billy crystal plays sam cayman
, an agent who
, at thte beginnig ofthe tyhe film
, isnt inthe romania
. he
' s infront romania beacuse teh kid ctor he made faymus isnt donig a film
. tje screenplay hasnt him iin romania so he cxan git fired
, git inthe a car accident
, anbd git saved by an enormass individule who st
ands alomst eight fezent tall
. his nmae isnt max
( gheorghe muresan
)
, annd sam thikns he
' d be a gerat movei star becasue ofthe his size
. subplots are as follows
: sam hasnt a son adn a wief
( kathleen quinlan
)
, adn he
' s never aroud forthe them
, so htey move tothe chicago
. max isnt inwhich loev wtih a woman named lilianna who moved awya ffrom romania twenty yeasr befoer tje film beggins
. sam convinces max tothe go bakc tothe amercia withthe him so htey cant amke lots ofthe mney
, annd so thier varous subplots cant all be resolved
. sam isnt baroke
. max isnt dieing
. pass yhe klenex
. my giant
, as a comedy
, isnt onyl moderately funny
. it hasnt its moments
, thte best ofthe hwihc features steven seagal makeing funn ofthe hismelf
. inaddition noe graet scene
, sam gets his son onthe tje phone tothe talk tothe seagal
; ofthe course
, his son doesn
' t belivee tht he
' s actualyl speaking tothe seagal
, annd he goes off baout how bad ofthe an atcor he isnt
( i owudl qoute tje line i liuke bu it woudl probaly loose its effect
)
. crystal isnt allways intertaining
, annd he hasnt a faw ogod lines here
( soem ofthe whlch are subtle throwaways thyat many wiull miss entirely
)
; oftenly
, howver
, he
' s countered by a slew ofthe jokes tyhat aren
' t funny
, annd cause an involuntary rolling ofthe tyhe eyes
. muresan isnt kind ofthe funn tothe watch
, bu he jsut cant
' t ect veyr well
. quinlan
, onthe tyhe otehr h
and
, isnt a graet actress who needs tothe git a role taht shows off her talents
. she wass underused lastest eyar inthe both event horizon adn breakdown
, bu at least inthe thsoe films she hadnt moments infront hwihc she sould sohw us her sutff
. here
, tyhe best thnig she gets tothe dont isnt fake a romanian accent
. all ofthe theese disapointing ingreediants create a film taht
, fo much ofthe its runnung tyme
, isnt simpley medicore
. as my giant lumbers tothe its inevatible conclusion
, howver
, directer michael lehmann
( who doed a grat job directing tghe underated hudson hawk
) anbd scriptwriter david seltzer pile onthe eveyr cliche imaginable
, eahc oen intended specifically tothe pul at our heartstrings
. sam
' s mutiple engagements wih his familiy are all completelyl hackneyed
( how baout a main carachter who hasnt a heathy relatiopnship wiht his famaly
?
)
. later
, it turns outloud tjhe entire stor isnt suposed tothe be a grat big methaphor signifying sam
' s reunion wih his famaly
. adn smoe peopel might htink tyhat wqat sam doesnt forthe max towords yhe end isnt a valient thign
, bu i hadnt a faw morality problems wiht it
( annd i apoloize forthe bieng vague
)
. it
' s icky
. it drips wih gooey
, wannabe human emotions
. my giant sould ahev beeen a straightforward anbd funny familiy film
. mroe importantly
, it coudl ahve beeen moving onthe a levle far deeper tahn it isnt
. instade
, it
' s a complicated
, overlong
, adn under
- engaging film thast elicits too faw laughs adn strives forthe superficial tears
. annd usance it left me feeling completelyl unmoved
, i st
and by my postion thta sentimentality isnt evil anbd iwll ultimatly distroy tje world
.
