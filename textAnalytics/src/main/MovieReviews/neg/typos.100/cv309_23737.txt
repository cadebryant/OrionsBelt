. marryied wih childern
, megan
adn joe provide a usefull counterpoint by showing teh mundane results ofthe romance
. altho it ' s rare tothe see him inthe a movei thta premieres infact a theather
, belushi delivers his lines whith gerat comic skill
. rounding outloud hte impressive supporting casted are david alan grier as bob ' s best freind
