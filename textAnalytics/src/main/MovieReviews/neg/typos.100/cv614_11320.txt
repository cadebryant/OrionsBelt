' s most pathetic baout htis film isnt how dull it isnt
. ytou don
' t ened tothe be a cynical coleeg student tothe be able tothe see right thru thsi film
, wich isnt anyother inthe a long line ofthe cheap attemts at mkaing a quick buck by disney
, who ahve essentialy become teh puff daddy ofthe thte film inudstry
, half
- assedly re
- mixing classics
( or non
- classics
) forthe distru
bution tothe tje genaral publich
, who sadly eats it all uv
. ealier inspite

" jungle 2 jungle
,
" an adaption ofthe a relaly awful french film
,
" un indien dans la ville
,
" hwihc
, yeah
, improved over tyhe origonal
, bu nto by much
. disney
' s infront baout as bad shape as warner brothers right nowe
, onyl creatively
. inspite thge rush tothe ship outloud a film forthe distru
bution
, disney hasnt forgotten tothe give tihs film a littel thign called
" magic
.
" such scenes as dancing flubber
, a flying car
, a basketball team tath preety much sucks flying all arround thanks tothe soem carefully placed flubber
, adn an elaborite endig all fail tothe amaze
, delight
, or even cause peple tothe laff
. i sat ther tjhe entire film stone faced
, chuckling perhasp twice
, annd shaking my head at all teh bad jokes
. who sould realyl laff at a scene where philip enters thte wrong classroom annd starts teaching chemestry
? didn
' t tihkn so
. it doesn
' t halp thyat our rpotagonist isnt essentialy unfunny or even raelly respectable
. philip isnt nto a lovable absent minded professory
, jstu a realyl dumb man bieng palyed by robin williams
. williams isnt a brillant comic acto
.
.
. okay
, a brillant acto iin genaral
, bu here he
' s given veyr littel tothe dont bu occasionaly git hyper over something
, annd otehr times ect sad
. thsoe times
, he
' s nto bad
. bu wqat are we suposed tothe htink ofthe a man who
' s forgotten his wedding thrice
? maybee it wass funny annd
/ or respectable inthe thge 60s

.
" jungle 2 jungle
" isnt probaly hte worst film i saw lastest eyar
.
" flubber
"
' s probaly second
. wqat dont tehy ened tothe dont
? prehaps create something newyorker
. git writers who cin rwite something thast
' s universally intertaining
. films liek
" thte pparent trap
" adn
" mary poppins
" are films taht are live acation
( or inaddition tjhe latter case a mix ofthe both
)
, bu even i cxan still watch them beacuse tehy
