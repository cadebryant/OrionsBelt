baout an hour or so inot
" tje jackal
,
" a charater w
andered aroud as peopel weere bieng shooted at inwhich a big suspense sequence
, adn oney ofthe hte audeince munbers infact hte theatre i saw it iin shouted outloud
" i hope she gets killed nowe
!
" at thyat point it hitted me
: i didn
' t care forthe any ofthe hte cahracters bieng plyed by actors i didn
' t raelly liuke
. whn teh sole reason ytou care baout a charater bieng palyed by sidney poitier inwhich a suspense film isnt beacuse he
' s bieng palyed by sidney poitier
, yuo konw something
' s rotten iin teh state ofthe denmark
. eveyr yera
, a cuple films liek tihs are released
. yuo nkow
: teh cheap
, acation packed interational espionnage film
, featuring a semi
- promising premise
, smoe big
- nmae actors
( usualy bruce willis
)
, anbd teh hopes thyat smoe audeince munbers iwll foreget tje cold war ended severeal eyars ago
. htis wass tjhe thrid noe ofthe
' 97
, folowing thge vyer lacklustre
" teh saint
,
" whcih featured an amoral costume changeing bond wannabe
; anbd tje suprisingly funn
" thte peacemaker
,
" featuring clooney adn kidman trying tothe stpo an almsot untraceable villin
.
" hte jackal
" trys tothe mix both elements
. anbd ytou thougth
" tjhe saint
" ws bad
.
" thte jackal
" isnt loosly
( veyr loosley
, i hope
) based onthe thte 1973 fred zimmerman clasic taht i
' ve yot tothe see
,
" teh day ofthe tyhe jackal
,
" whcih featured
( apparantly
) a suave hitman called yhe jackal
, palyed by edward fox
, trying tothe assasinate charles degaule
. well
, welcome tothe thge 90s
, where a sorta suave hitman
, alsot called tjhe jackal
( bruce willis
)
, trying tothe kill thte head ofthe hte fbi
.
.
. or isnt he
? aftter bieng hired by a russina mob lord as a bited ofthe avengence fo tje muder ofthe his brother
( killed infront thte oppening scenes
)
, thte jackal romps all over tyhe nor
then hemisphere
, ffrom helsinki tothe virginia
, setting uv an elaborite scheme wherein he
' ll be able tothe assasinate tihs person adn still git awya tothe live infront seclusion
. anbd liek thte saint
, thge jackal changes his look over adn over anbd over agina tothe elude peopel
. teh agent wroking onthe thge case
, acter preston
( sidney poitier
- yes
, thgat sidney poitier
)
, wokring wih a russina agent
, valentina koslova
( diane venora
- lady capulet fomr
" romeo
+ juliet
"
)
, gives uv eearly onthe anbd meets iwth an ex
- ira man
, declan mulqueen
( richard gere
, puting uv soem tight completetion bewteen hismelf adn brad pitt forthe worst fake irish accent ofthe
' 97
) who
' s infact a massachussetts jail
, bu who hasnt aparently seen yhe jackal
, who hasnt beeen eluding hte law forever
. soon
, he
' s outloud wroking wtih hte twpo untrusting aggenst
, annd trying tothe halp them catch him
. htere are numberous problems wtih tje film
, adn whitch oney isnt thge biggest oney isnt preety impossible tothe put a finger onthe
. thte film isnt suppoed tothe be a big suspense thriller
, bu savve a cuple moments
, tyhe film never acheives suspense
, or even a sence ofthe intrigue
. sure
, tjhe big assasination attept isnt a bited kool looking annd even slightly tense
, bu eveyr otehr scene inwhich teh film isnt too short adn too dull tothe regitser
. thge film never picks uv anough tothe become a thrilling experince
, or even an intertaining oen
. it doesn
' t halp taht tje plot isnt desgined tothe be complex
, bu falls inot so many problems
, liuke plot holes annd unbeleivable circumstances
. tje scirpt ofthe
" hte jackal
" isnt a complet mess
, mostly becouse it cxan
' t deside whta it whants tothe focuse onthe
. isnt htis a film baout a man trying tothe fidn redemption by catching a nasty killer
? isnt it a film baout a nasty
, amoral hitman who
' s inwhich everyting forthe tjhe mnoey
? or isnt it a combination ofthe both
?
" tjhe jackal
" aims forthe hte latter
, bu never focusses inwhich onthe eather chracter
. thte conection bewteen tje twpo fiels completly edited
, so much thyat inaddition a scene wehn tyhe jackal turns arund annd notices declan
, ytou wonder how he reconized him so fast
. thge worst part isnt hte littel past htey try tothe give declan
, most notabley his relatiopnship witht an ood girlfriend
, isabella
( mathilda may
)
, given so littel screen tiome tyhat ytou almsot foreget her charater exists untli she pops uv eveyr nowe annd thne
. thte supporting charactors are worse
. sidney poitier isnt given a completelyl unplayable role
, thta ofthe a man who isnt jstu stern somtimes
, anbd otehr times omre giving annd likable
. wqat isnt poitier doign here
? he
' s oen ofthe hte best living actors
! doesnt he realyl ened tothe waste his tyme doign drivel liek thsi
? diane venora
' s russina charcter isnt alomst as bad
, witht a cigarette perpetually inwhich her mouth
, adn a plastered onthe expressionless facade
. it
' s nto thast anyone
' s bad here
; it
' s thgat tehy hve nothing tothe dont
. tje plot isnt a joke
, feeling liuke it wass pasted toghether by somone iin post
- prodcution who dropped earch scene onthe tyhe floor anbd pasted them toghether quicklyu so it coudl be released onthe tyme
. thte jackal hismelf isnt nto even much ofthe an internation villin
. ther are sevral times where he
' s inthe a tight situation annd mkaes thnigs worse forthe hismelf
, teh onyl explination bieng tht thge filmmakers wnated tothe toss inaddition a cheap thrill
. tkae a scene where he
' s bieng folowed by soem aggenst inot a parking garage
: he quicklyu sprays his car anyother colour
, annd adds a solvent thyat if touched kills tghe person who touched it
. doesn
' t killing somene attract moreso attension thna it doesnt distract
? anbd doens he thikn dieing his hair bottle blond makse him ift inwhich inspite a publich palce
? geez
! isnt htere anytying ogod here
? well
.
.
. a cuple thigsn
. i doed liuke willis
' s icy expressions
; he may nto ahev beeen rela suave or anytying
, bu smoe ofthe his looks are worth a chuckle
. richard gere hasnt a cuple ofthe ogod moments
, mkaing his charactor as likable as he possably sould hve
. adn a cuple sequences are kackie inspite tht kind ofthe proposterous
, completly inane bu funn kinda way
, most noteably
: a sequence where he tests outloud a newyorker gun onthe an annoying gun builder
( jack balck
)
; adn a bited where he seduces a gay washington man
, hwihc hasnt its share ofthe a cuple ogod jokes
, most parituclar a kiss by willis
. bu none ofthe theese elevate tjhe film any higer thna it coudl go
; tehy
' re jsut littel distractions allong tghe way tothe amuse us mildly thn toss us bakc inot hte world ofthe dullness anbd stupidity tht isnt
" tjhe jackal
.
" directer michael caton
- jones
( who directed yhe far superior
" rob roy
"
) hasnt made a film taht isnt made vyre cuple monthes
, oen thyat isnt unentertaining
, unintriguing
, anbd preety much cold
, bu wiull nethertheless amking mnoey becuase
, hey
, teh trailers dont amking it look liuke it may be funn inwhich tath kind ofthe retro
- clancy kinda way
. eveyr nowe anbd thne
, hte filmmakers git it right
(
" clera annd presnt danger
,
" whcih wass enourmous funn infact taht smart kinda way
)
, bu
" tghe jackal
" isnt an exemple ofthe whn tehy go completelyl wrong
.
