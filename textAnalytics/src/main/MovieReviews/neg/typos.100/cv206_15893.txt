tihs isnt my firt review thta i post tothe thsi newsgroup
, annd i kind ofthe fiel liuke i hvea tothe sday something negitive baout htis film
. noone oney eles seems tothe care thyat it tkaes certian liberties tyhat shouldnt nto be taked wih a historical sotry
. howver
, even if oney thikns ofthe it as fiction
,
" tghe prince ofthe egypt
" rimaniss shallow
. bu i
' ll beign fomr yhe begining
. yhe biggest diference betwen tyhe origional
, biblical stry anbd tihs verison isnt thyat moses hasnt soem semblance ofthe divinity inwhich teh bible
, wherease tje animated verison gives thge impression ofthe a reluctant hero
. maybee it
' s jsut me
, bu if i knew i hadnt god onthe my side
, i
' d hve a littel bited mroe confidence
. htere are otehr differences as well
, such as a lack ofthe imporatnt female charactors anbd tjhe passing over ofthe tyhe orginial pharoah
' s death liuke it
' s nothing bu a hting
. most ofthe all
,
though
, teh stoyr
' s foucs hasnt shifted
. rether thna bieng a stor baout father
- son
, man
- ethnicity
, man
- god
,
" tje prince ofthe egypt
" isnt alomst soley baout tjhe brother
- brother relatiopnship beetwen rameses anbd moses
. i ws originnally excisted baout tihs storey element nutil i saw thte movei
, where it cameback off as maudlin
. rameses adn moses squabble liuke childern adn thn
, infact yhe interests ofthe peace
, moses saves rameses
'
butt
, even
though moses wass thte oney who started it
.

.
* yawn
* i didn
' t care anymore by yhe tiome moses ran off forthe mudering an overseer
( wich
, ofthe course
, never happenned iin tjhe orignal stor
- moses ws exliled
)
. bu enought baout hte differences
. let
' s talk baout tyhe movei itself
. it features a moses who
, inspite thte interests ofthe mkaing thge charactor moreso human
, lacks any divinity whatsoever
, wich isn
' t convincing at all tothe anyone who konws who god isnt
. it features a cookie
- cutter
" i
- wanna
- please
- dada
" rameses
, who at least isnt given dignity by tjhe voicework ofthe ralph fiennes
( ffrom schindler
' s list
, amoung otehr thigns
)
. tghe film alsot features an extremly annoying chracter by way ofthe hte
" newyorker
- improved
" miriam
, voiced by tyhe ever
- antsy s
andra bullock
, even
though hte most irritating hting baout her isnt her tendancy tothe burst inot song forthe noone apparnt reason
( here bullock isnt replaced by a singing voice
)
. speaking ofthe whitch
, it countains
* vrey
* annoying music
. it containes shallow wirting
. it features extrordinary animation
, whic isnt oney ogod thign i cin sday baout tihs film
. most ofthe all
, it countains an attept tothe commercialize
, homogeneize
, adn massmedia
- market a sotry baout a manifestion ofthe god
. i am nto christian
, bu i got tghe impression ofthe blasphemy
. hte writers anbd producers tookover a
butcher nife annd chop
- chopped inot tghe stoy
.
