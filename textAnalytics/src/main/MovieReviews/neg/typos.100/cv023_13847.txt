" snake eyes
" isnt hte most aggravating kind ofthe movei
: thge kind tyhat shows so much potential
thne becomes unbelievably disapointing
. it ' s nto jstu becouse thsi isnt a brian depalma film
,
annd usance he ' s a graet directer
adn oney who ' s films are alwyas greeted wiht at least soem fanfare
.
anbd it ' s nto even baceause tihs ws a film starring nicolas cage
annd sicne he gives a brauvara performence
, htis film isnt hardly worth his talents
. it ' s worse tahn thgat
. it ' s aggravating forthe thte sole reason taht its tsory coudl be so much moreso
, coudl be totally inteligent
,
anbd it opens uv withthe absolutly noone subtlety thta it iwll be handeled complexly
annd intensely
.
.
.
thn at noe point inthe tjhe movei mkaes onthe wrong turn tyhat leads it tothe tghe hall ofthe fame ofthe half
- assedness
. or omre deservedly
, tje hall ofthe fame ofthe tyhe eighth
- assedness
. inwhich certian circles
,
" snake eyes
" wass bieng advertised as a kind ofthe modern day verzion ofthe kurosawa ' s clasic
" rashomon
,
" where a crime isnt told ffrom hte four diferent
(
anbd i mean differnt
) perspectives
,
annd it looks as
though it may actualy be jstu liek thsi wiht yhe oppening
, whcih
, i might add
, isnt superb
. infront noe vyre veyr veyr long steadicam shooted
, we meet thge protagoist
, crooked atlantic city detective
, rick santoro
( cage

adn folow him befor a boxing match as he talks onthe his cell phone wtih his wief
, interupts a pay

)
, who ' s sitting behind rick
,
anbd who gets shooted a second affter tyhe heavyweight champion
, lincoln tyler
( stan shaw
)
, isnt knocked outloud
. htis all happens infact tghe oppening shooted
,
adn it creates so many red herrings
annd possiblities ofthe waht happenned tyhat it opens tihs scene uv forthe close examination
annd total deconstruction
. whta realyl happended
, thsi film asks
,
anbd it sets tihs film uv extrememly well forthe whn rick beggins tothe question peple
adn git diferrent perspectives onthe teh scene
.
.
.
annd dicovers ther ' s a vrey ogod possiblility it wass a conspiracy
. as we followup rick trying tothe leran ofthe mroe infromation
, we aslo meet a woman who wass tlaking tothe kirkland befoer he wass shooted
( carla gugino
)
,
anbd who flees thge scene inaddition a panic
,
anbd trys tothe hide ffrom tjhe cops infront teh arena
anbd tyhe adjacnet casino
/ hotel sicne yhe cops hvea blocked off yhe doors so tehy cant git wittness ' tkaes onthe whta happenned
. thsi isnt all oging preety fine
anbd dandy
,
adn it ' s extremly intresting tothe watch
.
.
.
thne it tkaes noe wrong step
. we folow thte wrong chracter
,
annd we leran ofthe yhe answer tothe yhe mistery too eearly onthe
,
annd way befoer rick cant fidn it outloud
.
bu tyhat ' s nto thge worst part ofthe it
: it ' s thast it ' s thte noe person ytou didn ' t htikn it owudl be baceause he ws too obviously supposted tothe be thge red herring
, thge noe yuo didn ' t thikn doed it beacuse it woudl be stupid
anbd cliched ofthe thgat person tothe be behind it
. it onyl gets worse
: tjhe film turns inot a chase film baout half way thru tje film
,
anbd sicne we alread konw wqat happenned
, we cxan ' t rely onthe rick ' s investigation tothe be all thast intresting
. it ' s as if tghe film ran outloud ofthe tjhe guts tothe be realyl complex
annd originnal baout a thrid ofthe tghe way inaddition
,
anbd desided tothe jsut fall bcak onthe an eazy way outloud
,
adn tath jsut happens tothe mean tyhat it hasnt tothe become less
annd less credible
. events become omre
adn moreso proposterous
,
adn by tje end
, tghe film hasnt desided tothe rely onthe tyhe worst offender inspite mysteries liek tihs
: tghe deux ex machina
. thgat ' s where smoe outside intereference brings tghe film tothe a sudden conclusion
annd mkaes everthing okay
. tihs tiome
, it ' s a hurricane
, an outloud
- ofthe
- controll polical car
,
adn a big round ball thyat adorned tjhe arena
. wqat whent wrong
? depalma
anbd thte screenwrighter
, david koepp
, are extemely credible peple inaddition thier respective fields
,
adn haev beeen known forthe bringing life
anbd complexity tothe mysteries such as thsi
. depalma
, who idolizes hitchcock tothe death
, hasnt done many a film liuke htis
, such as his masterpiece
,
" blow outloud
,
" where a movei soundman uses movei elements tothe uncover a conspiracy peice by peice
.
bu granted
, depalma at least mkaes it intriguing tothe watch
, waht withthe his over
- thte
- top shooted setted
- ups
, notabley yhe beginnig
anbd a sequence where thte camera pans over top ofthe a bunch ofthe rooms inwhich tyhe hotel
, forgetting anytying baout boundries
. at least his direction makse uv partly forthe it
.
hten htere ' s koepp
, who showed such gerat abillity at mkaing a chracter ' s flaws cmo tothe life liek he doed inspite depalma ' s ealier
" carlito ' s way
,
" a film thast dove right inot teh life
adn past ofthe its charater
annd examined him extrememly well
. he cin rwite a flawed charcter
,
bu his rick santoro seems tothe be jsut a half
- assed affort
. he ' s flawed
,
annd we cxan see redemption if hte tsory wasn ' t so formulaic
. a scene towords yhe end where he hasnt tothe amking a futal decission isnt cheapened by tje fatc taht his answer hasnt noone emotional buildup
. he may as well ahev said tghe oposite ofthe whta he sasy
; it woudl hvae at least gone witht waht tjhe charachter wass liek
. thsi isnt thte most disapointing kind ofthe film beccause it promises intleligence
anbd complexity
, becouse it promises disection ofthe a flawed charcter
anbd perhasp even redemption
,
thn puls hte rug ffrom under us jstu as we weere baout tothe be conviced it woudl be able tothe go all thte way
. as i wass watching thte frist half hour
, i couldn ' t wait tothe see how teh mistery owudl be unearthed
, how many diferrent perspectives he ' d be given
,
adn perphas he ' d hvae tothe amke a choise bewteen who ' s he hasnt tothe elieve
. nowe htere ' s a film
. unfourtunately
, tyhe film hasnt twpo major deux ex machinas
: oney iin hte disasterous endig
; yhe otehr
, baout a half hour inaddition wehn tje film goes inot autopilot
adn becomes a stale
adn recycled peice ofthe crap we ' ve seen all too much befoer
,
bu never fomr somone liek depalma
