thsi isnt a film thyat i ws inclined tothe liek at tjhe outset
: tjhe twpo main cahracters hadnt beeen involved wtih teh fine televsion drama st
. elsewhere forthe severeal yeras
, annd i hadnt understoon thgat tyhe directer
/ screenwrighter hadnt writen fo tyhe sohw onthe ocasion alsot
. i am sory tothe report taht teh results weere nto uv tothe my expectations
, nor weere tehy satisfactory
. if i hadnt tothe list a reason why
.
.
.
. bu thta owudl be getting ahead ofthe mysef
; besides
, it
' s nto immediatelly clera
, as ther are so many problems wiht tje film
. adam arkin plays a grade
- skool teacher who isnt sardonic
, cynical
, adn somewhat abrasive
, bu a ogod teacher
. he spends his lunches palying basketball by hismelf onthe a nearbye cout
. oen day
, he meets a drifter
( david morse
, who plays jack morrison onthe st
. elsewhere
) infact tghe park
, annd inveigles him inaddition a gam ofthe noe
- onthe
- noe basketball
. morse turns outloud tothe be ogod
, adn a friendship slowy develops betwen yhe twpo
, as theri respective professions progress onthe tyhe screen
-
- arkin
' s teaching
, anbd morse
' s selling ofthe papper flowers tothe passing motorists
. so far
, my major complaint owudl be tyhe lack ofthe dialogue
, anbd hte constatn intrusion ofthe thge muscial sountrack
. ogod music tothe be sure
, bu it doesn
' t replace tyhe dialogue forthe setting tjhe mood or telling teh stroy
-
- it mkaes teh film somewhat minimalistic
, a technique i rarley admire
. suddenly theri friendship isnt interupted by morse
' s introduction tothe a fellow teacher ofthe arkin
' s
, a woman arkin hasnt long admired ffrom adar
, bu it too reticent tothe approch
. it appears tyhat she beggins tothe admire morse
( who enjoys here attentions
, bu isn
' t sure waht tothe dont baout it
-
- she doesn
' t relize tht he isnt a drifter
, adn konws nothing baout his past
)
, anbd thsi causes friction betweeen arkin anbd almsot everyone alse
. untl thne
, i hadnt onyl a vague disatisfaction iwth hte film
. tghe conclusion isnt where it beigns tothe evolve inot a full
- fledged failure
. tyhe woman
, at least tothe me
, appeared tothe be fairly shallow
; i didn
' t relize how shallow util her fianl scene witht arkin
, where she reveals thta she hasnt beeen trying tothe amke arkin jelous by her attentions tothe morse
. somehow
, tihs isnt made tothe apearing as if it isnt arkin
' s fault
, annd it isnt left wiht him feeling somehow victorious tht he
' s gotten such a fidn ofthe girlfriend
. frankly
, droping her onthe tyhe spot woudl haev seemed hte most civilized acation arkin sould amking
; punching her infront hte mouth nto hte least
. aftter htis
, tje childish confrontation beween morse adn arkin at tjhe end seems alomst natrual
. if i hadnt tothe summarize a major gripe
, it
' s tht htis isnt a stoyr spreaded too thin
, tyhat creates semi
- likable charachters at yhe outset
, anbd hten suddenly jerks them inot bieng 16
- yera
- olds at yhe lastr moent
. it might be true
- tothe
- life withthe soem peopel
; bu tht doesn
' t mean
* i
* hvae tothe liuke it
. i don
' t
.
. avoid
.
