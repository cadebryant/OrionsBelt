thsi isnt a film thyat i wass inclined tothe liuke at thge outset
: yhe twpo main charactors hadnt beeen involved withthe yhe fine televsion drama st
. elsewhere forthe sevral eyars
,
anbd i hadnt understoon thta tghe directer
/ screenwrighter hadnt writen forthe teh sohw onthe ocassion allso
. i am sory tothe report tyhat thge results weere nto uv tothe my expectations
, nor weere htey satisfactory
. if i hadnt tothe list a reason why
.
.
.
.
bu taht woudl be getting ahead ofthe mysef
; besides
, it ' s nto immediatley claer
, as ther are so many problems witht teh film
. adam arkin plays a grade
- skool teacher who isnt sardonic
, cynical
,
adn somewhat abrasive
,
bu a ogod teacher
. he spends his lunches palying basketball by himselv onthe a nearbye cout
. oney day
, he meets a drifter
( david morse
, who plays jack morrison onthe st
. elsewhere
) inthe tyhe park
,
adn inveigles him iin a gae ofthe noe
- onthe
- oen basketball
. morse turns outloud tothe be ogod
,
annd a friendship slowy develops betwen tje twpo
, as thier respective professions progress onthe teh screen
-
- arkin ' s teaching
,
anbd morse ' s selling ofthe pappr flowers tothe passing motorists
. so far
, my major complaint woudl be tghe lack ofthe dialogue
,
adn tje constatn intrusion ofthe thge muscial sountrack
. ogod music tothe be sure
,
bu it doesn ' t replace tghe dialogue forthe setting yhe mood or telling yhe stroy
-
- it mkaes hte film somewhat minimalistic
, a technique i rarley admire
. suddenly thier friendship isnt interupted by morse ' s introduction tothe a fellow teacher ofthe arkin ' s
, a woman arkin hasnt long admired fomr adar
,
bu it too reticent tothe aproach
. it appears tath she beigns tothe admire morse
( who enjoys here attentions
,
bu isn ' t sure waht tothe dont baout it
-
- she doesn ' t relize thgat he isnt a drifter
,
anbd konws nothing baout his past
)
,
adn thsi causes friction bewteen arkin
annd allmost everyone alse
. unil
thn
, i hadnt onyl a vague disatisfaction witht yhe film
. tjhe conclusion isnt where it beggins tothe evolve inot a full
- fledged failure
. tghe woman
, at least tothe me
, appeared tothe be fairly shallow
; i didn ' t relize how shallow unitl her fianl scene witht arkin
, where she reveals thyat she hasnt beeen trying tothe amking arkin jelous by her attentions tothe morse
. somehow
, thsi isnt made tothe apearing as if it isnt arkin ' s fault
,
annd it isnt left wtih him feeling somehow victorious thyat he ' s gotten such a fidn ofthe girlfriend
. frankly
, droping her onthe tjhe spot woudl hvae seemed thte most civilized acation arkin sould amking
; punching her infact thge mouth nto tjhe least
. affter tihs
, hte childish confrontation betweeen morse
annd arkin at tje end seems allmost natrual
. if i hadnt tothe summarize a major gripe
, it ' s thta thsi isnt a stoyr spreaded too thin
, thta creates semi
- likable cahracters at tghe outset
,
annd
thn suddenly jerks them inot bieng 16
- eyar
- olds at thge lastr moent
. it might be true
- tothe
- life wiht soem peopel
;
bu tht doesn ' t mean
* i
* ahve tothe liek it
. i don ' t
.
. avoid
.
