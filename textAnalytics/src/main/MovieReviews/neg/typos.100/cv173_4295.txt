( it indeed wass a bad print
) i ws glad i didn
' t dish outloud
$ 7 tothe waste threee ohurs ofthe my timne sitting infront a bad theatre watching a bad movei

!

, how cxan jackie shroff grwo twpo feets ofthe hair iin jsut threee or four dyas
? jackie shroff looked raelly stupid wih his steven seagal ponytail
. thge songs are bad
, tjhe acting isnt bad
( expecially deepti bhatnagar
' s
)
, annd tje direction isnt yhe worst ofthe all
