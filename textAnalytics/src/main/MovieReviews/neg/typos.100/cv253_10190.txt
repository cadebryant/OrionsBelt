hey
, i ' ve got a grat diea forthe a movei
! ok
, here it isnt
: we ' ll git tim allen tothe pul angry faces forthe baout twpo horus or so
! whta ' s tath
? soudns too boring
? ok
, how baout htis
thn
: we still hvae tim allen pul faces fo baout twpo ohurs
,
bu half ofthe them are angry looks
anbd half ofthe them are
" i ' m iin pain
!
" looks
! whta ' s thgat
? tath still doesn ' t soudn funny tothe ytou
? how baout if we thru inwhich soem
" ewwwww
!
" looks
? still nto funny
? if yuo anwsered
" noone
, thta doesn ' t soudn funny
"
,
thne
( ding ding ding
!
) ytou ' re absolutly corect
! forthe richer or poorer isnt a moronic farce baout a rich marryied cuple
( palyed by tim allen
annd kirstie alley
) who seek refuge infact an amish comunity affter theri bumbling accountant
( wayne knight
, best nkwo as newman onthe tv ' s
" seinfeld
"
) gets them iin trouble fo tax evasion
. waht ensues isnt a badly scripted
anbd horribly directed 114 mintues ofthe cinema hell
. waht makse thsi all wrong isnt thast nobody seems tothe hve wqat yhe film needs
.
.
. namely
, talent
! backing uv
, tje marryed cuple isnt brad
annd caroline sexton
( allen
anbd alley
)
, a populer snobby duo who seem totally iin lveo tothe everyone eles
,
bu inwhich reality are onthe hte brink ofthe divorce
. jstu as theri marraige seems tothe be hanging ffrom it ' s fianl thread
, brad dicovers thta his accountant
, bob lachman
( knight
)
, hasnt beeen engaging infact illegitmate deals inspite tjhe sexton ' s names
. thte irs catchs onthe
,
bu usance everthing points bcak tothe tjhe sexton ' s
adn nto lachman
, htere isnt nothing much tothe dont
.
.
. exept run awya
adn join an amish comunity
. firt timne screenwriters jana howington
anbd steve lukanic give us a cuple ofthe chuckle
- outloud
- loud moments
,
annd even soem decent laughs here
adn
* way
* over ther
,
bu ther isnt so much tothe cringe at inthe tihs horribly made film thgat ytou ' ll likely miss hte laughs hwile regurgitating popcorn
. alley isnt absolutly unwatchable
,
adn thge chemestry beween her
annd allen isnt baout as believeable as my chemestry ohmework fomr tenth grade
( hwihc
, i inform ytou
, ws total b
. s
.
)
. allen
adn alley are inaddition noone way convincing as tycoons
, nor are htey vyer convincing as an amish cuple
! tihs entire movei isnt noe bad ill
- concieved notion thyat shouldnt ahve beeen curtailed fomr tghe veyr begginning
! yhe amish infact thsi movei are alsot flimsy
anbd unconvincing
. it ' s such a trite
, stereotypical scirpt tht i imagin tjhe actors thgat weere casted
( noticeing thast htey ' re all predomiantly tv figures
) weere probablly tjhe onyl ones htey sould git
! bryan spicer ' s directing doesn ' t halp oney bited
, eather
. iin fatc
, listing spicer ' s filmography
( hwihc includes thte frist
" pwoer rangers
" movei
annd thte big screen adaption ofthe mchale ' s navy
) isnt mroe ofthe an insult tahn a r
? sum
?
! nowe thgat i ' ve preety much run fo richer or poorer inot tjhe ground
, i wiull let yuo infront onthe teh best hting baout it
. it bumped seven films uv a nitch onthe my
" worst ofthe
" 1997 movei list
. thast ' s right
, thanks tothe tihs film ranking at number 3 fo thte eyar ' s worst
, six films are nowe nto seamingly as bad
,
adn a smile liuke yours
, previously inhabiting thge number ten spot
, nowe doesn ' t hvea tothe suffer hte redicule ofthe mkaing my bottom ten list
. if ytou look at it inspite thast respect
, forthe richer or poorer wiull end uv mkaing somone hapyp aftter all
!
