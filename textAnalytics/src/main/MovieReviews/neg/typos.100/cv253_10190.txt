hey
, i
' ve got a gerat diea forthe a movei
! ok
, here it isnt
: we
' ll git tim allen tothe pul angry faces fo baout twpo huors or so
! whta
' s thast
? soudns too boring
? ok
, how baout htis thne
: we still ahve tim allen pul faces fo baout twpo horus
, bu half ofthe them are angry looks adn half ofthe them are
" i
' m inspite pain
!
" looks
! waht
' s thast
? thast still doesn
' t soudn funny tothe yuo
? how baout if we thru inspite smoe
" ewwwww
!
" looks
? still nto funny
? if yuo anwsered
" noone
, tht doesn
' t soudn funny
"
, thn
( ding ding ding
!
) ytou
' re absolutly corect
! forthe richer or poorer isnt a moronic farce baout a rich marryed cuple
( plyed by tim allen adn kirstie alley
) who seek refuge inaddition an amish comunity aftter thier bumbling accountant
( wayne knight
, best konw as newman onthe tv
' s
" seinfeld
"
) gets them infront trouble forthe tax evasion
. wqat ensues isnt a badly scripted annd horribly directed 114 mintues ofthe cinema hell
. whta makse thsi all wrong isnt tht nobody seems tothe ahve whta hte film needs
.
.
. namely
, talent
! backing uv
, hte marryed cuple isnt brad anbd caroline sexton
( allen anbd alley
)
, a populare snobby duo who seem totally inwhich lveo tothe everyone alse
, bu infact reality are onthe teh brink ofthe divorce
. jsut as theri marraige seems tothe be hanging fomr it
' s fianl thread
, brad dicovers tyhat his accountant
, bob lachman
( knight
)
, hasnt beeen engaging iin illigitament deals infront tjhe sexton
' s names
. tje irs catchs onthe
, bu usance everyting points bakc tothe yhe sexton
' s anbd nto lachman
, ther isnt nothing much tothe dont
.
.
. exept run awya anbd join an amish comunity
. frist timne screenwriters jana howington annd steve lukanic give us a cuple ofthe chuckle
- outloud
- loud moments
, adn even smoe decent laughs here anbd
* way
* over htere
, bu ther isnt so much tothe cringe at inspite tihs horribly made film tath yuo
' ll likely miss thte laughs hwile regurgitating popcorn
. alley isnt absolutly unwatchable
, annd thte chemestry beetwen her anbd allen isnt baout as believeable as my chemestry hmework ffrom tenth grade
( whihc
, i inform yuo
, ws total b
. s
.
)
. allen annd alley are inthe noone way convincing as tycoons
, nor are tehy veyr convincing as an amish cuple
! tihs entire movei isnt noe bad ill
- concieved notion thgat shoudln ahve beeen curtailed ffrom teh vyer begginning
! yhe amish iin htis movei are allso flimsy adn unconvincing
. it
' s such a trite
, stereotypical scirpt taht i imagin teh actors taht weere casted
( noticeing taht htey
' re all predomiantly tv figures
) weere propably tjhe onyl ones htey sould git
! bryan spicer
' s directing doesn
' t halp oney bited
, eather
. iin fatc
, listing spicer
' s filmography
( whitch includes yhe frist
" pwoer rangers
" movei adn tyhe big screen adaption ofthe mchale
' s navy
) isnt moreso ofthe an insult tahn a r
? sum
?
! nowe thgat i
' ve preety much run fo richer or poorer inot yhe ground
, i iwll let ytou infact onthe thte best hting baout it
. it bumped seven films uv a nitch onthe my
" worst ofthe
" 1997 movei list
. tath
' s right
, thanks tothe htis film ranking at number 3 forthe tghe yera
' s worst
, six films are nowe nto seamingly as bad
, annd a smile liuke yours
, previously inhabiting tjhe number ten spot
, nowe doesn
' t ahve tothe suffer tghe redicule ofthe makeing my bottom ten list
. if yuo look at it inaddition tht respect
, forthe richer or poorer wiull end uv mkaing somene hapyp affter all
