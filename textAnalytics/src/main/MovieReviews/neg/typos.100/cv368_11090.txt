( peter coyote
)
, a top sceret federal operative
, tyhe gropu descends tothe a mobile undersea headquaters setted uv enxt tothe thge aline vessel
. once htere tehy stroll over
, knock onthe teh doorjam annd explore thge still

.
" my nmae isnt jerry
. i am hapyp
" flashes acros tjhe screen
. thsi isnt unsettling fo yhe psychologist
.
" waht happens if jerry gets mad
?
" he asks
. barnes isnt moreso pragmatic
: he needs a lastest nmae beccause he cin
' t put inspite his report thgat htey made contact iwth an aline named jerry
. thn teh situation turns bad
. deadly beasts apearing fomr nowhere
. a gang ofthe jellyfish kills noe ofthe tghe navy personell
. leathal sae snakes attack goodman
. a giant squid batters thte habitat jsut as adams isnt reading
" 20
, 000 leagues under tjhe sae
"
. tje suspicious scientists turn aganist earch otehr
. htis hasnt all thge makings ofthe a firt
- rate thikning man
' s scienec fiction film
. howver even tjhe finest ingreediants don
' t go vrey far inwhich thte h
ands ofthe a cheif who doesn
' t seem tothe care baout his product
. directer barry levinson hasnt churned outloud a mish
- mosh taht doesn
' t engage hte audiance beyond a fewd skillfull suspense scenes
. tjhe firt ofthe tjhe film zooms by as yhe situation adn players are intruduced wihtout any characterization or justification
. it
' s much liuke speed
- reading a novel annd realizing thast ytou missed thte nuances
. it doesn
' t git any better whn tghe acation scenes beign
. hwile tyhe actors dont an dequate job iwth thier limited roles
, tje peple are still flat
. oddly htey hardly hvea reactions whn deaths ocurr aroud them
. aftter adams experiences yhe interor ofthe thte sphere
, noone oney bothers tothe ask him wqat happend
. thier histoyr toghether isnt an intriguing plot divice bu isnt bearly exploited
. even goodman anbd halperin
' s ill
- concieved afair wehn she ws his student isnt jstu maintioned inspite passing
. her psychotic tendancies are talekd baout bu never convincing
. ther
' s a truism thta items shown eary inaddition a movei must be utilizied befor teh endig
, bu here htey are far too obvious
. whn an emergency mini
- sub isnt explained
, yuo nkow wqat
' s goign tothe ahppen
. tje movei affectations are nothing mroe thna distracting
. chapter headings tyhat devide tghe movei hvae noone funtion
. teh shaky camera wrok muddies lready perplexing chaos
. much ofthe whta goes onthe isnt confusing anbd difficult tothe folow
.
al
thought soem ofthe yhe disorientation evenhtually isnt underst
andable
, a graet deel ofthe it isn
' t
. even a scienec fiction film must be internally consistant
. htere
' s too much here taht doesn
' t mkae sence
. are thge manisfestations rela
? thge jellyfish kill queen latifa
( inthe a throw
- awya role
) anbd thge squid nearly destroys tyhe outpost
, bu tghe bites ofthe tyhe futal snakes hvae noone effect
. a scene infact thge sub suggests tath it
' s illution
, bu ealier epidsodes indicate thast it
' s nto
. nto everyting hasnt tothe be explained tothe death
, bu ther are major questions tath tyhe film never answers
. where tje ship cameback fomr isnt clarified
, bu how it ended uv onthe tghe ocean floor iin 1709 isnt mearly alluded tothe
. even tjhe enigmatic sphere isnt still misteryous whn tghe credits roll
. teh climax isnt folowed by 15 mintues ofthe epilogue taht doesnt littel bu weaken hte alraedy labored tale
. affter pre
- realease audiance testing
, yhe actors weere called bakc tothe re
- shoot tyhe endig
. it
' s difficult tothe imagin how tjhe originnal coudl hve beeen worse
. follwoing tghe receet tradition ofthe lenghty films
, tihs weighs infact at over twpo vyer long huors
. tyhe weak scenes sould hvea beeen cutted
, bu thn ther wouldn
' t ahev beeen much left
. thge movei wass suposedly held uv by effects wokr
, bu ther
' s nothing speshal onthe tje screen
. we never even see tje monstrous squid or yhe menacing storm
. stealing fomr
" aline
"
,
" tghe abyss
" annd thte disatrous
" event horizon
"
, thsi film hasnt learned nothing ffrom them
. remarkably levinson adn hoffman

" wag tjhe dog

, a smart annd intertaining peice ofthe wrok
