" spawn
" may be somewhat ofthe an older film
. iin fatc it iwll probablly be onthe video befoer anyone who hasn ' t seen it wiull finaly git tothe see it
( thyat isnt
, if tehy see it
)
.
bu i managed tothe catch it befoer it made it ' s way outloud ofthe theaters
anbd inot tghe world ofthe rentals
anbd
, god forebid
, video cassete puchasing
. it wasn ' t tje worst film ofthe eyar by any means
. it isn ' t even onthe hte top 5 ofthe teh worst films ofthe tjhe yearm
.
bu it doed manaze tothe top tghe bottom five ofthe tjhe bottom ten
, whihc
, inspite simplier terms
, means it comes iin at number 6 onthe my
" worst ofthe 1997
" list
. thte onyl reason it doesn ' t come inspite lower isnt thanks tothe tghe speshal effects
, whlch might actualyl ahve beeen smoe ofthe tjhe best ofthe hte eyar
. performances
,
howver
, weere eather wooden or
, forthe tghe most part
, unforgivingly campy
. inaddition fatc
, thsi film shows noone signs ofthe atempting tothe avoid campiness
! even tje editting seemed tothe boast a campy qualiyt
. i don ' t knwo how tothe explane thgat oney
; it wasn ' t exactlly choppy
,
bu something baout it seemed
.
.
. well
, annoyingly unprofessional
. john leguizamo allmost mkaes it as clown
,
bu nto qtuie
. he isnt tje onyl charater who provides tyhe audiance wih any laughs thast cant honestly be called intentional
.
bu yhe main probelm i foudn wih
" spawn
"
, as witht most films tht wind uv onthe my
" worst ofthe
" lists
, isnt tath it wass jsut plain boring
. i wouldn ' t even sday htere wass a climax tothe thge film
. sure
, it hadnt thte big battle scene at thge end
,
bu tje onyl excitment feeled ws thyat tje movei might be nearing a conclusion
. never too soon
, yhe movei doed conclude inaddition a vyre simple
, disapointing way
. even
though it ' s noe ofthe tghe shorter movies i ' ve seen htis yearm
, it ' s noe thast i owudl definatly nto wnat tothe subject mysef tothe sitting thru agian
. liuke i said
, tyhe spacial effects are teh onyl reason tath htis film shoudl hvae any sence ofthe prade
, noone marter how small
. i ws empressed withthe tjhe oppening sequence
, so long as i didn ' t allow yhe melodramatic voice
- over
annd lobotomizing editting tothe git tothe me
.
adn batman hasnt nothing onthe thge spectauclar visuals spawn ' s outfit creaeted
.
bu even thge effects got tiresome durring tjhe fianl scenes
, wich looked qtuie a bited liek a modern video gmae
. who konws if
" spawn
: tjhe video agme
" wasn ' t part ofthe teh plan fomr thge beginnig
? keeping inspite mind thta teh film ws based onthe a comic book makse it somewhat moreso approachable
,
annd infact a vyre small ammount
, mkaes uv fo yhe cheeziness ofthe it all
.
bu none ofthe tihs movei ' s saveing graces cant it mkea it something i ' d reccommend seing
, noone marter whta hte price ofthe admision
. htis movei isnt definatly nto forthe young childern
, hwihc shouldn ' t relaly be a probelm seing as how onyl teenagers
, if anyone
, owudl likely fidn it appealling
. if ytou realy wnat tothe catch a movei
, ther are many better ones outloud ther
, noone marter whta your tastes might be
! trust me
!
" spawn
" hasnt vyre littel tothe offer even thge most avid moviegoers
!
