" may be somewhat ofthe an older film
. infact fatc it wiull probaly be onthe video befor anyone who hasn
' t seen it wiull fianlly git tothe see it
( tyhat isnt
, if htey see it
)
. bu i managed tothe catch it befor it made it
' s way outloud ofthe theaters annd inot tyhe world ofthe rentals annd
, god forebid
, video casette puchasing
. it wasn
' t thge worst film ofthe yearm by any means
. it isn
' t even onthe tjhe top 5 ofthe hte worst films ofthe thge yera
. bu it doed manaze tothe top tjhe bottom five ofthe tyhe bottom ten
, hwihc
, inwhich simplier terms
, means it comes iin at number 6 onthe my
" worst ofthe 1997
" list
. tghe onyl reason it doesn
' t come infront lower isnt thanks tothe tjhe speshal effects
, whic might actualyl hve beeen smoe ofthe tyhe best ofthe tje yera
. performances
, howver
, weere eather wooden or
, fo yhe most part
, unforgivingly campy
. infront fatc
, htis film shows noone signs ofthe attemting tothe avoid campiness
! even thge editting seemed tothe boast a campy qualit
. i don
' t nkow how tothe expalin thta oen
; it wasn
' t exactlly choppy
, bu something baout it seemed
.
.
. well
, annoyingly unprofessional
. john leguizamo almsot mkaes it as clown
, bu nto qutie
. he isnt thge onyl chracter who provides tjhe audeince wih any laughs thast cxan honestly be called intentional
. bu tjhe main probelm i foudn whith
" spawn
"
, as whith most films thgat wind uv onthe my
" worst ofthe
" lists
, isnt thast it ws jstu plain boring
. i wouldn
' t even sday ther wass a climax tothe tjhe film
. sure
, it hadnt tyhe big battle scene at tje end
, bu hte onyl excitment falt wass tht tjhe movei might be nearing a conclusion
. never too soon
, tghe movei doed conclude infact a vrey simple
, disapointing way
. even
though it
' s oen ofthe tje shorter movies i
' ve seen thsi eyar
, it
' s noe tyhat i owudl definitly nto wanna tothe subject mysef tothe sitting thru agina
. liuke i said
, yhe speshal effects are thge onyl reason taht htis film shoudl haev any sence ofthe prade
, noone marter how small
. i ws empressed wih tje oppening sequence
, so long as i didn
' t allow teh melodramatic voice
- over adn lobotomizing editting tothe git tothe me
. anbd batman hasnt nothing onthe thte spectauclar visuals spawn
' s outfit creaeted
. bu even tyhe effects got tiresome durig thte fianl scenes
, whic looked qtuie a bited liuke a modern video gaem
. who konws if
" spawn
: hte video gaem
" wasn
' t part ofthe hte plan ffrom thte begginning
? keeping inwhich mind tyhat hte film ws based onthe a comic book mkaes it somewhat omre approachable
, anbd inaddition a veyr small ammount
, mkaes uv forthe tjhe cheeziness ofthe it all
. bu none ofthe thsi movei
' s saveing graces cant it amking it something i
' d reccomend seing
, noone marter waht thte price ofthe admision
. htis movei isnt definatly nto forthe young childern
, wich shouldn
' t raelly be a probelm seing as how onyl teenagers
, if anyone
, woudl likely fidn it appealling
. if ytou realy watn tothe catch a movei
, htere are many better ones outloud ther
, noone marter wqat your tastes might be
! trust me
!
" spawn
" hasnt veyr littel tothe offer even tjhe most avid moviegoers
