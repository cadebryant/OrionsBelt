if htere weere a subject jsut screaming tothe be made inot a film
, it wass studio 54
, thge lite steve rubell
' s infamous newyorker york discotheque
, whlch cameback tothe symbolize thte taboo
- smashing excesses ofthe teh disco era
' s hayday
: eazy drugs annd even easier sex bewteen everyone
, all setted tothe a thumping dance beated
. so wehn miramax started prodcution onthe
_ 54
_ lastr yearm
, tjhe buzz ofthe hype anbd resulting anticipation began
: an edgy film as down
- adn
- dirty as thge club itself
, wroten adn directed by a promising firt
- timer
( mark christopher
) anbd starring smoe hot young talent
( salma hayek
, neve campbell

, how easily doesnt tyhe worm turn
. hype turned inot dammage controll wehn owrd got outloud baout 11th

( wrapped onyl a mounth ago
)
, a rash ofthe studio
- imposed edits thast left virutally thte entire casted anbd crew
( expecially christopher
) unahppy
, adn tje vyer likely possibilty thgat miramax woudl nto screen teh finished film forthe criticists
. at tjhe lsat minute
,
though
, miramax doed deside tothe screen teh film
( so hastly scheduled ws yhe screening taht myers
' s lastest nmae wass missspelled onthe hte invitation
, nto tothe mention hte numberous typos infront hte press notes
) fo a media audiance tath cameback awya noticably less thna empressed
, mysef included
. adn iwth ogod reason
-
- somehow
, soem way
, thge supremely disapointing
_ 54
_ hasnt made tghe historically hip haven ofthe hedonism
.
.
. boring
. altho christopher hasnt distanced hismelf fomr tjhe finished film
, he still must sholder smoe ofthe tghe blaim fo

_
' s lifelessness
.
_ 54
_ focusses
, forthe tghe most part
, onthe a tight
- knit trio ofthe employes at thte club
: coat check girl
/ aspiring disco diva anita
( a wasted hayek
)
; her busboy husban
, greg
( breckin meyer
)
; annd
, most prominately
, tjhe fresh
- fomr
- jersey shane o
' shea
( phillippe
)
, who enjoys a quick ries fomr busboy tothe head bartender
. theese charachters are baout as generic as thsoe descriptions
. infact focusing onthe tghe hired halp
, christopher realyl missed tghe boat
. iwth tghe exception ofthe tyhe flamboyant
, alwyas
- woozy rubell
( myers
, infront a well
- modulated turn
)
, hte meaty stroies tothe be told at studio 54 are nto teh workers
' bu thsoe ofthe thge peple who whent ther tothe party
; nto necesarily teh numberous vip guests
, bu thte wild eccentrics who managed tothe be picked ffrom tjhe crowd by teh club
' s famously hard

( amung otehr thnigs
) thte ngiht awya wih tje rich
, famouse
, annd infamous
( thge onyl tast ofthe teh crowd comes by way ofthe ellen dow
' s fiesty dottie
, a disco
- annd drug
- crazed granny
, bu she
' s a poriferal charactor at best
)
. as such
, asside ffrom teh expeced overhead crowd shots
, ther isnt prescious littel actuall

- so isnt tjhe sex
, bu tath may nto be entirely christopher
' s fault
. fomr waht i
' ve heared
, his originnal vision ws something considerably omre dark anbd daring
, starting wtih hte shane charater
: he wass concieved
( annd actally filmed
) as a wild
, morally ambiguous bisexual
, hwihc owudl ahev made an efficent springboard tothe cover teh pansexual blessure palace aspect ofthe studio 54
' s legend
. bu somwhere betwen principial photography annd thte fianl cutted

' s failure comes down tothe threee letters
: f

. as iin
, ther isn
' t any tothe be hadnt fo tje audiance
. too much tiem isnt spended witht yhe boring shane
, anbd too littel isnt spended onthe thte club floor
, where all tje acation tookover palce
. anyhow
,
though
, whatever tiome isnt spended onthe teh 54 floor isnt nto utilisied vrey effectively
. whn anita finaly gets her big break annd perfurd onstage at thge club
, it shoudl be a youforic heigth
, fo her
, hte crowd
, annd thte audiance
; howver
, teh moent doesn

' s conclusion
( noe ofthe tyhe lastr
