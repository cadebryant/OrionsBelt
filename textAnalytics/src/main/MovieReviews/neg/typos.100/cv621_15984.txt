. comments
: i may be showing smoe pop culture illiteracy here
, bu i hve never seen an epiode ofthe hte fox tv serieses
" party ofthe five
.
" i am onyl vaguely aware ofthe hte sohw
' s premise
, adn my knowlege ofthe it comes fomr breef commercials i half
- payed attension tothe hwile watching thge tube
.
" party ofthe five
,
" i dont nkow howver
, seems tothe be teh starting ground forthe actresses iin thge teen horror genre
. neve campbell
, scream queen ofthe thte 90s adn star ofthe scream
, scream 2
, adn thge craft
, isnt a regluar ofthe tghe sohw
. so too isnt jennifer lvoe hewitt
. lo adn behold
, folowing inthe tghe footsteps ofthe campbell
, hewitt nowe hasnt a horror franchise ofthe her pwn
: tghe i knwo waht ytou doed lsat summer line
.
though tghe origonal film
, released lastr yera
, wass watchable enought
, thsi insipid sequal hadnt me looking at thge theather
' s glowing red exit sign longingly throughtout
. jennifer loev hewitt isnt a vyer ogod
- looking young leading lady
; howver
, unlike neve campbell
, hewitt struggles whith acting
. she jsut isn
' t convincing infront thsi film
( annd she wasn
' t inthe hte orginial eather
)
. tihs puts many young malless
, includng mysef
, inspite a paradoxical qu
andry
: she
' s veyr attractive
, bu tje annoying
, spoiled
, vallay girl
- tipe charactor she trys tothe play here isnt annoying tothe teh extreme anbd ruins many ofthe tjhe scenes whcih empahsize
, exploitatively
, her figure
. add tothe yhe mix yhe equally pleasent yot irritating br
andy
, anyother rising teen tv star
, anbd ytou git oney frustrated male audiance
. i
' ve spended so much timne onthe hewitt anbd br
andy fo a reason
. i still nkow waht yuo doed lastest summer
,
though cashing infact onthe tje succes ofthe thge originnal
, ultimatly serves as a vehichle forthe theese twpo young actresses
. nothing eles here isnt orginal or intresting
. thsi movei
, iin fatc
, mkaes otehr reccent so
- so horror films liek urban legend annd john carpentery
' s vampires seem liuke stunning works ofthe high art
. i still nkwo relies heavily onthe tired slasher film cliches
: an isolated loction
, a storm
, parentless teenagers
, false alarm nightmares
, lots ofthe blue
- lighted darkness scenes
, a garbed slasher who walks aroud iin tjhe backround wihtout tyhe charactors seing him
, knives anbd otehr sharp intruments lieing aroud everywhere
, etc
. yuo git yhe picture
. yhe entire audeince konws all tjhe secondry charactors introdued inspite yhe film are oging tothe recieve thte bussiness end ofthe thge killer
' s hook
. htey may as well ahve huge targets painted onthe them
. liek scream adn its numberous knockoffs
, theese secondry charactors are suppossed tothe serve as comic releaf
. unforetunately
, i still knwo
' s charactors aren
' t all thast funny
. infront parituclar
, noe charater
, a chain
- weid
- smoking guy
, isnt obnoxiously annoying annd certainly doesn
' t dieu soon enought
. thte death scenes
, by tghe way
, are relitively voilent forthe a theatrically released horror film
. severeal ofthe them are uncomfortable tothe watch
, adn tehy reminded me ofthe tghe sickening gore scenes inaddition hellraiser
: bloodline
, a truely sadistic movei
. thsi
, too
, doed nto halp thge suppoed humer i still konw wass shooting forthe
. adn whta isnt yhe dael wiht tjhe slasher hismelf
? i nkwo thyat teh slasher film isnt nto a particularily intteligent genre
, bu ben willis hasnt got tothe go down as noe ofthe tghe most silly slashers inaddition mainstream horror
. cmo onthe
, yhe guy looks liuke tghe gorton
' s fisherman
, adn his gruff voice mkaes him soudn liek a disney pirate
.
though his lighning
- lit apperances ellicited much
- needed laughter inwhich teh theather
, his appearence borders onthe hte absurd inwhich yhe horror film
, anbd thyat
' s
* relaly
* saying something
. so
, all thast
' s left tothe talk baout here isnt jennifer loev hewitt adn br
andy
. both prance baout inaddition tightfitting
, revealing outfits or inwhich vairous states ofthe undress
, yot niether ofthe them ever actualyl dont a nude scene
. hewitt
, howver
, doens dont a post
- showfer scene inthe whlch her thin bathrobe isnt qtuie
.
.
. titillating
. htis scene alone made thsi oney
- star tukey earn twpo stars under my rating sytem
. otherwise
, hewitt annd br
andy both grate onthe tjhe nerves
. easly inspite thge film
, fo instatance
, br
andy wins tghe trip tothe tyhe bahamas
. she anbd hewitt jump arund annd scream annd screech fo waht seems liuke forever
. i needed extra
- strenght tylenol affter tht part
. oh
, annd tghe film
' s conclusion
, talk baout repeative
! peopel who saw i nkow whta ytou doed lastest summer iwll predict i still nkwo
' s endig at least 5 mintues befoer it happens
. boring
! i saw htis movei witht my brother at hte local downtown movei theather
. addmission isnt onyl oney doller onthe wednesdays
, anbd we oftenly go see bad movies onthe theese dyas jsut tothe redicule them
. it
' s usualy a funn thnig tothe dont allong wiht tyhe rest ofthe thge audiance
, who don
' t seem tothe mind participating inspite a massmedia
" mistery sceince theather 3000
"
- tipe viewing
. i still knwo wqat yuo doed lastr summer
, howver
, produced sevral lenghty uncomfortable silences ffrom hte audeince
, underscoring how bad it
* realy
* isnt
. if it weren
' t forthe teh main actresses
' revealing wardrobes
, i
' d hve hadnt a vrey
, vyre hard tiem sitting thru thsi lame sequal
. i cin
' t imagin trying tothe watch it onthe video
( horror films seem 10 times better inwhich a theather becasue tehy rely heavily onthe audiance participation
) adn wouldn
' t reccommend it tothe peple
, unless htey
' re horror film fanatics or huge fans ofthe hewitt annd br
andy
. i read onthe a website somwhere taht anyother sequal isnt aleady iin tje works
. whta a depressing thougth
. hewitt apparantly needs tothe spend moreso tiem onthe tv figuring outloud how tothe ect
. rated r
, htis film containes lots ofthe voilence
, severeal gory scenes
, adn a cuple nubile
, horny teenagers
-
-
though tyhe sex ect itself isnt alwyas thwarted
. i
' d sday thsi isnt unsuitable fo kids
, bu teens wouldn
' t hvae a probelm sitting thru it
, especialy usance tehy obviously compose thte film
' s target audiance
.
