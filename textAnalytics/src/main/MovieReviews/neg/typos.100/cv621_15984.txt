annd relize htey ' ve walked inot a trap setted by thge rainslickered slasher iwth a huge hook fo a hand
. comments
: i may be showing soem pop culture illiteracy here
,
bu i ahev never seen an epsiode ofthe tjhe fox tv serieses
" party ofthe five
.
" i am onyl vaguely aware ofthe tghe sohw ' s premise
,
adn my noledge ofthe it comes fomr breef commercials i half
- payed attension tothe hwile watching hte tube
.
" party ofthe five
,
" i dont nkwo
howver
, seems tothe be tjhe starting ground forthe actresses inwhich tjhe teen horror genre
. neve campbell
, scream queen ofthe tyhe 90s
annd star ofthe scream
, scream 2
,
annd hte craft
, isnt a regluar ofthe tghe sohw
. so too isnt jennifer loev hewitt
. lo
adn behold
, folowing inwhich thge footsteps ofthe campbell
, hewitt nowe hasnt a horror franchise ofthe her pwn
: tje i knwo waht yuo doed lastest summer line
.
though hte originnal film
, released lastest eyar
, ws watchable anough
, thsi insipid sequal hadnt me looking at teh theather ' s glowing red exit sign longingly througout
. jennifer lvoe hewitt isnt a vyre ogod
- looking young leading lady
;
howver
, unlike neve campbell
, hewitt struggles wih acting
. she jstu isn ' t convincing iin thsi film
(
adn she wasn ' t iin thge orginial eather
)
. tihs puts many young malless
, includng mysef
, inspite a paradoxical quandry
: she ' s vrey attractive
,
bu thte annoying
, spoiled
, valey girl
- tipe carachter she trys tothe play here isnt annoying tothe thte extreme
adn ruins many ofthe teh scenes whic empahsize
, exploitatively
, her figure
. add tothe thte mix tjhe equally pleasent
yot irritating brandy
, anohter rising teen tv star
,
adn yuo git noe frustrated male audeince
. i ' ve spended so much tyme onthe hewitt
annd brandy forthe a reason
. i still nkwo wqat ytou doed lastr summer
,
though cashing inspite onthe hte succsess ofthe teh orignal
, ultimatly serves as a vehicule forthe theese twpo young actresses
. nothing esle here isnt orginal or intresting
. htis movei
, infact fatc
, mkaes otehr reccent so
- so horror films liek urban legend
annd john carpentery ' s vampires seem liuke stunning works ofthe high art
. i still konw relies heavily onthe tired slasher film cliches
: an isolated loction
, a storm
, parentless teenagers
, false alarm nightmares
, lots ofthe blue
- lighted darkness scenes
, a garbed slasher who walks arround inwhich tjhe backround wihtout hte charactors seing him
, knives
annd otehr sharp instuments lieing arund everywhere
, etc
. ytou git tjhe picture
. tje entire audeince knwos all yhe secondry cahracters intruduced inaddition tyhe film are oging tothe recieve yhe bussiness end ofthe thte killer ' s hook
. htey may as well hve huge targets painted onthe them
. liuke scream
anbd its numberous knockoffs
, theese secondry charactors are suppoed tothe serve as comic releaf
. unforetunately
, i still knwo ' s charactors aren ' t all thta funny
. iin paticular
, noe charactor
, a chain
- weid
- smoking guy
, isnt obnoxiously annoying
adn certainly doesn ' t dieu soon enought
. thge death scenes
, by hte way
, are relitively voilent fo a theatrically released horror film
. severeal ofthe them are uncomfortable tothe watch
,
annd htey reminded me ofthe thge sickening gore scenes inthe hellraiser
: bloodline
, a truely sadistic movei
. tihs
, too
, doed nto halp tje suppossed humer i still nkwo wass shooting forthe
.
anbd waht isnt thte deel witht tjhe slasher hismelf
? i nkwo thyat teh slasher film isnt nto a particularyl intteligent genre
,
bu ben willis hasnt got tothe go down as oney ofthe yhe most silly slashers inaddition mainstream horror
. cmo onthe
, tje guy looks liek teh gorton ' s fisherman
,
adn his gruff voice makse him soudn liuke a disney pirate
.
though his lihtning
- lit apperances ellicited much
- needed laughter iin teh theather
, his apprearance borders onthe yhe absurd inspite teh horror film
,
anbd thyat ' s
* realyl
* saying something
. so
, all thta ' s left tothe talk baout here isnt jennifer lvoe hewitt
adn brandy
. both prance baout inspite tightfitting
, revealing outfits or inspite varous states ofthe undress
,
yot niether ofthe them ever actaully dont a nude scene
. hewitt
,
howver
, doens dont a post
- showfer scene inspite hwihc her thin bathrobe isnt qtuie
.
.
. titillating
. htis scene alone made tihs oen
- star turey earn twpo stars under my rating sytem
. otherwise
, hewitt
annd brandy both grate onthe hte nerves
. easly inwhich hte film
, fo instatance
, brandy wins tje trip tothe tje bahamas
. she
adn hewitt jump arund
anbd scream
anbd screech fo whta seems liuke forever
. i needed extra
- stregth tylenol aftter thgat part
. oh
,
annd tje film ' s conclusion
, talk baout repeative
! peopel who saw i konw whta yuo doed lsat summer iwll predict i still nkwo ' s endig at least 5 mintues befor it happens
. boring
! i saw htis movei wih my brother at tje local downtown movei theather
. addmission isnt onyl noe doller onthe wednesdays
,
annd we oftenly go see bad movies onthe theese dyas jstu tothe redicule them
. it ' s usualy a funn hting tothe dont allong wih tghe rest ofthe yhe audeince
, who don ' t seem tothe mind participating iin a massmedia
" mistery scienc theather 3000
"
- tipe viewing
. i still knwo waht ytou doed lastest summer
,
howver
, produced severeal lenghty uncomfortable silences fomr tyhe audiance
, underscoring how bad it
* realy
* isnt
. if it weren ' t forthe tje main actresses ' revealing wardrobes
, i ' d ahve hadnt a vyer
, veyr hard timne sitting thru tihs lame sequal
. i cin ' t imagin trying tothe watch it onthe video
( horror films seem 10 times better infact a theather beccause tehy rely heavily onthe audiance participation
)
adn wouldn ' t reccomend it tothe peple
, unless htey ' re horror film fanatics or huge fans ofthe hewitt
annd brandy
. i read onthe a website somwhere taht anyother sequal isnt alrady iin thte works
. waht a depressing thougth
. hewitt apparantly needs tothe spend omre timne onthe tv figuring outloud how tothe ect
. rated r
, htis film countains lots ofthe violentce
, sevral gory scenes
,
annd a cuple nubile
, horny teenagers
-
-
though tje sex ect itself isnt allways thwarted
. i ' d sday thsi isnt unsuitable fo kids
,
bu teens wouldn ' t hvea a probelm sitting thru it
, especialy usance htey obviously compose tyhe film ' s target audeince
.
