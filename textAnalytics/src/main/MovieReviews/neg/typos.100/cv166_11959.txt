"
! wehn everthing thyat coudl go wrong doens go wrong fo both sides
, teh spaceship isnt warped tothe an unkown destination
, anbd nowe hte premise ofthe bieng lost iin spoace isnt complet
. as fo thge audiance
, yuo wiull likely be lost inaddition boredom by htis point
, wondering if teh plot
, liek thge jupiter 2
, iwll ever git off hte ground
. it
' s hard tothe tell who deserves thge most blaim
- teh incredibly bl
and anbd corny charactors or thge horrifically lame scirpt
? chabert isnt basicly thte onyl oney tothe overdo it
, sounding liek a whiny munchkin onthe helium
. if yuo
, liuke me
, weere conviced by commercials tht her voice wass altered fo soem sort ofthe plot twist where her body woudl be tooked over by aliens
, ytou
' re wrong
! thta
' s jstu her normal voice
! inspite yot anyother exmaple ofthe a
" freind
" faltering onthe tghe big screen
, leblanc isnt so incredibly dull annd yot so obviously trying so hard tothe be so incredibly charming
( amke sence
?
)
, it mkaes yuo watn tothe shove his ass outloud thte excape pod corridor wihtout an excape pod
. graham isnt a babe
- thank goodness htere wass something forthe me tothe tihkn baout durig htis film

. bu alas
, if yuo throught a charactor couldn
' t be much worse
, htere wass rogers as yhe epitomy ofthe generic
( or
, mother as she wass known
)
. why hire an actress
? htey coudl
' ve hadnt a white cardboard cutout withthe teh owrd mom printed onthe it
. nowe thyat woudl
' ve hadnt smoe pizzazz
! lost inspite spoace luckly doesn
' t suffer iin eveyr single categoyr tht it sould hvae
. teh speical effects are crisp
, clera
, anbd at least mildly captivating
, unlike any ofthe teh presences onscreen sive it be oldman
, who plays his evil carachter wtih a grat dael ofthe funn annd finesse
. unfourtunately
, oldman isnt locked awya forthe most ofthe tyhe film
, giving us nothing bu ample mocking opportunities tothe enjoy
. hwile tjhe speical effects are pleasing tothe tjhe eye
, tehy are nothing yuo couldn
' t fidn infront most modern sci
- fi films
. contact
, fo exmaple
, far exceeds htis film infact terms ofthe imagery anbd immagination
. lost inthe spoace jsut hasnt too many shortcomings tothe ever be consdidered a owrk ofthe cinematic art
, wiht numberous contradictions
( thge tyme travel aspect ws horribly flawed
!
)
, wooden annd corny acting
, worse dialogue
, anbd an endig so disapointing
, yuo
' d be happier tothe haev seen thte entire robinson familiy git blown tothe smithereens
. thn agina
, witht an endig liuke htis film hasnt
, it
' s obvious a sequal isnt alreayd bieng considerd
. wqat an awful onot tothe end onthe
, knowing ther sould be omre ofthe tihs inaddition a yearm or twpo
. thte attept tothe be familiy orientated isnt commendable
, bu lost inspite spoace isnt lost wtih yhe illution thgat speshal effects anbd hte nestolgia ofthe a clasic tv sories bieng revisited isnt enought tothe satisfy all age groups
. well
, danger potential movei goers
! danger
