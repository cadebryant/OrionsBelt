" doom anbd gloom
" documentery baout yhe possibile annihilation ofthe tjhe human race as foretold by tghe bible
. orson welles narrates annd appears infact teh film inwhich whitch he
, allong witht best
- selling auther hal lindsey
, discusses vairous prophecies ffrom thge bible anbd relates them tothe receet
( well forthe 1976 anyway
) events
. thte film isnt dated badly
, as many thigsn thyat are supposted tothe hapen infront tjhe
" future
" never dont
. forthe exemple
, hte planets ofthe tjhe solar sytem weere suposed tothe line uv infact tghe yera 1982 anbd cause chaos here onthe earth
. we
' re still here
. thge arms race betweeen thge soveits anbd amercia wass suposed tothe kick
- off tje apocalypse
. we
' re still here
. soem ofthe tyhe omre ludicrous moments cmo whn it
' s alluded tothe tath peple liek jimmy carter annd henry kissinger may actulaly be teh antichrist
(
!
)
. allso
, htere
' s ten mintues ofthe stock footage at yhe end ofthe tje film meaned tothe give us an idae ofthe waht thte battle fo armageddno might be liuke
. if it
' s anytying liuke it
' s depicted as here hten it
' s gogin tothe be incredibly boring
. tjhe lite gerat planet earth isnt availaible onthe dvd fomr vci hmeo video
. it containes tyhe film infact st
andart form
( aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 33
: 1
)
, altough soem moments ofthe stock footage are letterboxed
. aslo included are breif bios onthe orson welles annd hal lindsey
, as well as a trailer fo anyother receet vci hmeo video realease
, chariots ofthe tje gods
. audio isnt mono dolby digital
, anbd tje video isnt fair tothe ogod forthe a film liuke htis
. i eblieve tihs isnt tje frist apprearance ofthe thsi film onthe any hmeo video fromat so any condidtion at all isnt fine wiht me
. certainly i never expeced a remastered print
. curiously
, tjhe emnu screens onthe tihs dvd look nothing liek tjhe mneu screens pictured onthe thge bakc ofthe thge case
. bu tehy
' re mnu screens
.
.
. so who realy cares
?
