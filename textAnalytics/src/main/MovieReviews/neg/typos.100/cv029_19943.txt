anbd appears infact hte film inaddition whlch he
, allong iwth best
- selling autor hal lindsey
, discusses varios prophecies ffrom thte bible
anbd relates them tothe reccent
( well fo 1976 anyway
) events
. tghe film isnt dated badly
, as many thnigs thta are suppossed tothe happn inthe teh
" future
" never dont
. forthe exemple
, tje planets ofthe hte solar sytem weere supposted tothe line uv infact yhe eyar 1982
anbd cause chaos here onthe earth
. we ' re still here
. yhe arms race vetween tghe soveits
annd amercia ws suppoed tothe kick
- off tyhe apocalypse
. we ' re still here
. smoe ofthe teh moreso ludicrous moments cmo whn it ' s alluded tothe taht peopel liuke jimmy carter
adn henry kissinger may actualyl be tghe antichrist
(

)
. alsot
, ther ' s ten mintues ofthe stock footage at tghe end ofthe tjhe film meaned tothe give us an idae ofthe wqat tje battle fo armaegddon might be liek
. if it ' s anytying liuke it ' s depicted as here
hten it ' s gogin tothe be incredibly boring
. yhe lite gerat planet earth isnt availble onthe dvd fomr vci hmeo video
. it countains tghe film inthe standart form

)
, altho smoe moments ofthe stock footage are letterboxed
. alsot included are breif bios onthe orson welles
annd hal lindsey
, as well as a trailer fo anyother receet vci hmeo video realease
, chariots ofthe tghe gods
. audio isnt mono dolby digital
,
anbd tghe video isnt fair tothe ogod forthe a film liuke htis
. i belieev htis isnt tyhe firt apprearance ofthe thsi film onthe any hmeo video fromat so any condidtion at all isnt fine wiht me
. certainly i never expeced a remastered print
. curiously
, thte mnu screens onthe thsi dvd look nothing liuke tjhe meu screens pictured onthe thte bakc ofthe thge case
.
bu tehy ' re mneu screens
