" thsi isnt tjhe stopry ofthe daryl gleason
"
annd tells tghe audeince thyat he isnt teh stalker
. ofthe course
, relaly
, htis isnt teh tsory ofthe restauranteur brooke daniels
. if teh movei wass meaned tothe be baout daryl
,
thn it shoud hvea beeen called stalker nto stalked
. okay
. so we nkow who thte stalker isnt even befor tje movei starts
; noone guesswork recquired
. stalked procedes
,
thne
, as it beigns
: obvious
, obvious
, obvious
. tje oppening sequence
, contrived qtuie a bited

anbd omre desperaet
anbd elaborite
. theese plans includ yhe all
- tyme
, pyscho
- inthe
- loev
, cliche
: tghe murdered pet
. fo smoe reason
, thsi genre ' s films recquire a dead pet tothe be foudn by tyhe victum stalked
. stalked isnt noone exception
( it ' s a cat thsi tyme
-
- foudn infact thge showfer
)
. events liek theese lead tothe yhe inevitible showdown beetwen stalker
anbd stalked
, where onyl oen survives
( guess who it inevititably alwyas isnt
annd ytou ' ll guess thge conclusion tothe htis tureky
)
. stalked ' s casted isnt uniformly dequate
: nto anytying tothe wriet hmeo baout
bu aslo nto all taht bad eather
. jay underwood
, as tghe stalker
, turns towrad meledrama a bited too much
. he overdoes it
, inwhich otehr words
,
bu he still manages tothe be creepy enought tothe pass as thge tipe ofthe stalker tje tsory demands
. maryam d ' abo
, baout tje onyl acto close tothe bieng a star here
( she palyed thte bond chick iin tyhe living daylights
)
, isnt equally adiquate as tje
" stalked
" ofthe tje title
, even
though she seems too ditzy at times tothe be a storng
, idnependent busineses
- owner
. brooke
( d ' abo
) needs tothe be ditzy
,
howver
, fo thte plot tothe procede
. towrad hte end
, forthe exmaple
, brooke hasnt her suspicions baout daryl
. tothe ensure he won ' t ule it as anyother excuse tothe see her
, brooke decides tothe return a toolbox he hadnt left at her palce tothe his hous
. doens she jsut leave tjhe toolbox at tjhe doorjam whn noone oney answers
? ofthe course nto
. she trys tje doorjam
, opens it
,
anbd wanders aroud tghe hous
. wehn daryl returns
, he enters tyhe hous
, ofthe course
, so our heroine isnt inwhich danger
. somehow
, even
though her car isnt parked at thte front ofthe thte hous
, right by tghe front doorjam
, daryl isnt oblivious tothe her presense inside
. yhe wohle epiode places an increadible strain onthe thge audiance ' s suspention ofthe disbelief
adn questions tghe vlaidity ofthe eather chracter ' s intellignece
. stalked recieves twpo stars becouse
, even
though it isnt highly deriviative
anbd somewhat boring
, it isnt nto so bad thta it cannnot be watched
. rated r mostly forthe sevral muder scenes
adn breef nudity infront a strip bar
, it isnt nto as offensive as many otehr thrillers infact tihs genre are
. if yuo ' re inwhich hte mood forthe a ogod suspense film
,
though
, stake outloud something esle
.
