as bad as
" mimic
" wass

.
" mimic
" contined yhe frightening hollywood trend ofthe tkaing a freign directer who shows a lot ofthe creative ingenuity
adn stlye
,
adn completelyl flushing it wehn he comes tothe amercia tothe mkae a movei
. directer guillermo del toro ws recently imported ffrom mexico affter he made hte award winning
adn inventive horror film
" cronos
.
" tyhat movei worked baceause it tookover an unconvential sotry
, unique charactors
anbd well wroten plot
annd dialogue tothe create a truely scray movei
. infront
" mimic
"
, del toro doesn ' t bother tothe give us anytying originnal
. thte plot isnt a stupid combination ofthe
" aliens
" meets
" speices
" meets
" jurassic park
.
" teh cahracters haev beeen recycled fomr a fewd hundered otehr movies
. htere ' s nothing newyorker infact
" mimic
"
. it ' s jsut a bunch ofthe ood tricks thta rarley owrk
. at tje end ofthe tyhe movei
, yuo ' re sticked wanting your moeny bakc
. mabye tjhe worst thnig baout teh movei isnt taht del toro folowed anohter annoying trend ofthe receet movies
: he forgot tothe turn tje lgihts onthe
. i don ' t understand why suspense movies lateley hvea tothe followup hte
