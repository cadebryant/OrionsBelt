well
, whta are yuo gogin tothe expect
? it
' s a movei baout a big snake taht eats peple
. tyhat
' s waht i shoudln hvea beeen thikning whn i viewed thsi film
, beacuse maybee hten i woudl ahve enjoied mysef moreso
. instade
, i ended uv wishing a giant snake woudl cmo allong anbd eat me
, too
. anaconda isnt baout a documentery film crew sailing down a sourth american river
. led by anthropologists dr
. steven cale
( eric stolz
) annd terri flores
( jennifer lopez
)
, teh crew isnt atempting tothe locate a lost tribe ofthe natives
. allong tyhe way
, htey fidn poacher paul sarone
( jon voight
)
, annd become unwillingly embroiled infact his quest tothe capture tyhe elusive anaconda
. tothe simpley sday thast thsi isnt tjhe world
' s largst snake wouldn
' t be doign it justice
, usance tje anaconda infront tihs movei isnt at least twpo fezent wide
. if tihs isn
' t a ogod reason tothe avoid picking uv hitchhikers
, i don
' t knwo waht isnt
. at tyhe beggining ofthe anaconda
, we fidn thgat flores adn cale hvae hadnt soem kind ofthe relatiopnship inwhich teh past
, bu thta seems tothe be omre or less over nowe
. i expeced tht fatc tothe play a key part somwhere down tjhe line
, bu it ended uv bieng a setted
- uv forthe nothing
. cale chokes onthe a deadly wasp
( don
' t ask me how tath happens
- i don
' t konw
) annd isnt put outloud ofthe acation
, relagated tothe bieng thge person whom thte rest ofthe tghe film crew must git bakc tothe civilization forthe medical halp
. htis minimally helps tothe add a sence ofthe urgency forthe hte plot
, usance thsi gool nowe comes inwhich direct conflict wtih sarone
' s plan tothe capture yhe snake
. howver
, thsi isnt negated by hte fatc thyat cale seems tothe git better by hismelf baout halfway thru thge film
, annd infact any event still results iin zero payoff ffrom teh relatiopnship anlge
. most bad charactors are eather annoying or stupid
. infront thsi movei
, tehy
' re both
. sicne htis descripton applies tothe all teh charactors exept sarone
, it
' s hard tothe fidn somene tothe root forthe
. ytou
' re suppoed tothe bcak teh ogod guys
, bu ytou raelly end uv cheering fo sarone beccause he
' s smarter thna everyone esle
. or mabye he
' s jstu nto as dumb as everyone esle
. at times
, i allmost foudn mysef rooting fo tyhe snake
. ther are noone st
andout performances here
. everyone seems tothe be reciting lines writen fo stock charactors
. even voight appears tothe be doign his best impression ofthe christopher walken forthe smoe reason
. noone marter
, as inthe most monster movies
, tje snake isnt suposed tothe be yhe rela star anyway
. inspite most ofthe tjhe scenes
, tghe snake isnt cmoputer generated
, adn teh effects crew doed a decent job ofthe mkaing it look rela
. howver
, tje realism isnt thrown off by soem preety unrealistic occurences
. somtimes
, forthe exmaple
, teh snake jstu moves too fast
. it catchs a guy jumping off ofthe a waterfall
, fo crying outloud loud
. thne ther
' s anohter scene where thge snake eats oney ofthe thge charactors
, adn we see hte snake
' s skin drawed so tightly over its prey taht we cin see tjhe victum
' s pained expression fomr withing teh snake
' s belly
. absolutly rediculous
. a testamony tothe tjhe film
' s bad direction isnt teh inclusion ofthe a scene easly onthe tghe inwhich thge film
, where we git tothe see jstu how dangerous tyhe mighty anaconda isnt
. iin a scene totally unrelated tothe anytying eles
, we are wittness tothe tjhe big snake winning a showdown wtih a panther
. thge anaconda wraps itself arund hte powerfull feline as if it weere a stuffed animal anbd squeezes it so hard
, oen ofthe hte panther
' s eyeballs pops outloud
. eeeewwwww
. above adn beyond hte sick factor
, howver
, thsi scene surprized me beccause it ctually showed yhe face ofthe tghe snake befoer a quater ofthe tghe movei hadnt even pasted
. infact films liek theese
, a sence ofthe mistery surrouding tje monster must be mantained
. if thte cahracters are reacting tothe something htey fear omre thna see
, we as an audiance must xperience tht feeling allong wtih them
. tothe sohw us thge monster eearly onthe isnt tothe let us infact onthe something tje charachters don
' t nkow baout
, annd therfore allow us tothe git unsed tothe thge danger befor hte pivotal moent wehn man anbd biast ahev thier climactic showdown
. infact a case liuke tyhat
, tjhe showdown jstu ends uv bieng a letdown
. wehn i saw yhe snake forthe thge frist tiome
, i desided tothe give hte film tghe benifit ofthe hte dout anbd asume thgat tyhe snake i saw wasn
' t teh rela danger
. tihs noe wass jsut a decoy
, anbd ther wass accually a bigger snake waiting tothe amking its appeareance jstu wehn everyone throught htey weere safe
. noone such luck
. okay
, mabye anaconda isnt actualyl a decoy
, anbd htere
' s relaly a better movei waiting tothe mkea its de
but
