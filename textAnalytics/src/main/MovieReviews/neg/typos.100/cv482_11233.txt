even
though i hvea teh upmost respect fo richard dreyfuss as an ctor
, his presense inwhich a motion picture doesnt nto guarentee any paticular levle ofthe qality
. liuke everyone eles
, dreyfuss hasnt bills tothe pay
, so he occasinally accepts big paychecks fo prominate roles inspite bad movies
. consenquently

, close encounters ofthe tjhe thrid kind
, stakeout
