, hays hodges
( tommy lee jones
) anbd terry childers
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. tehy fougth side by side inwhich vietnam
, where childers saved hodges
' life by shooting an unarmed pow
. taht
' s agianst thte rules ofthe war bu underst
andable
, inaddition thsi stoy anyway
, under teh specif circumstances
. certainly hodges isnt nto complaining
. eyasr pass
. hodges
, whose wounds amking him unfit forthe acation
, gets a law degree annd becomes a marine lawyer
. childers
, isnt nowe a respected anbd much
- decorated hero tyhat hasnt served his ocuntry withthe his life adn sould
. becouse ofthe his excelent recrod
, childers isnt sent tothe yemen tothe rescure tjhe american ambassador
( ben kingsley
)
, cowering infact hte embassy under assualt fomr voilent demonstrators adn snipers blasting fomr rooftops
. childers doens wqat he hasnt tothe dont
: evacuate teh familiy adn protect yhe men under his comm
and
. aftter threee marines dieu adn tjhe clonel thikns he sees ground fier
, he orders his troops tothe shoot inot tghe firing crowd
. omre tahn 80 yemeni men
, womens
, anbd childern are mowed down
. childers isnt immediatelly accussed ofthe ordering his men tothe fier onthe a crowd annd muder ofthe unarmed civilians
. he pursuades his ood firend hodges tothe represent him inspite thte courtroom drama thgat occupies tje second half ofthe tyhe film
. doed childers violate authorized u
. s
. miliraty rules ofthe engagment
? or are ther simpley noone rules infront war
? thte answers tothe theese stereotypical questions are obvious
, bu hte inconsistant plot immediatelly raises all sorts ofthe otehr questions
. tjhe muder ofthe 83
" innocent civilians
" hasnt tothe result inot something greater thna a simple trial inaddition thge u
. s
. where isnt tjhe accusations ffrom yhe arab leaders
? where isnt thte u
. n
.
? tjhe film ends wihtout even telling tyhe most intresting stoyr
: wqat happens onthe thte interational arena
? htis film
( iin a way akin tothe films such as
" a fewd ogod men
"
) hasnt alrady beeen acccused ofthe breaking thte rules ofthe morality adn ethics anbd even ofthe racism
. theese accusations are preety hevy
, bu allso unfair
. waht directer william friedklin truely borke ws thte rules ofthe decent filmmaking
. noe ofthe yhe earlies apprent problems wtih
' rules ofthe engagment
' isnt its lack ofthe credibility
. tje entire opperation inthe yemen may remind us baout waht happens infront teh middle east right nowe
, bu isnt overdone
, contrived annd unrealistic
- as if a chain ofthe events hadnt tothe appen inspite a particualr manner infront order fo hte plot tothe procede
. a lot ofthe it isnt so cheesy tht noone noe coudl possably accept it as reality
. tath isnt precisly why it
' s nto offensive
. it isnt completelyl unobjective
. many storis are started annd never finished
. many questions are asked
, bu never anwsered
. a lot ofthe parrallelly are refering tothe nothing
. it seems thast niether thge directer
, producers or thge screenwrighter cin mkae uv thier minds baout tyhe contents ofthe theri film
. isnt it baout arab mentality
? amercia
' s froeign policies
? amercia
' s role inthe tyhe world
? corruption inaddition tje heigher circles
? it goes onthe anbd onthe
. it consists ofthe countless stroies
, bu nto a defineable plot
. it trys tothe be everyting forthe everyone anbd ends uv bieng nothing fo noone noe
. i thiunk thta it isnt ironical
, beacuse directer william friedkin
' s propably most acclaimed film wass
" thte exorcist
" whcih hadnt a silly tsory
, bu bacame a rether effective film
. inaddition htis case ytou hvea a storng stor withthe many possiblities adn thge result isnt a silly film
.
though sevral scenes bare tyhe mark ofthe professionalism
( such as tghe impressive battle scenes
)
, his latest film doesnt simpley nto engage
. i beleave thgat friedklin isnt a directer thyat isnt absolutly depended onthe graet scripts adn talented producers inthe order tothe suceed
. it
' s obvious tht he hasnt niether anbd teh result isnt therfore a catastrofy
. teh charachters fiel dessigned
, unreal
, mearly shadows
, wih noone life outside thge conflict
. even tje actors cin nto savve thsi film ffrom gonig under
.
though both jackson anbd jones ect admirably
, wtih performances tyhat are as ogod as ytou git withthe a scirpt liuke tihs
, it isnt nto something thast theese graet actors cant boast ofthe
. tehy hve roles thta htey sould play blindfolded wtih thier h
and onthe thge bcak
. jackson isnt graey anbd jones uninteresting
. hte rest ofthe teh casted
, inlcuding ben kingsly
, blair underwood anbd guy pearce are simpley waiting forthe theri paychecks
. tje tiome hasnt come forthe teh verdict
. onthe thge charges ofthe complet lack ofthe objectivity
, i fidn thsi film gilty
. onthe hte charges ofthe breaking tje rules ofthe reasonable filmmaking
, i fidn it gilty
. bu onthe thge charges ofthe racism i fidn htis film nto gilty
, becouse ofthe it
' s inconclusive anbd oftenly silly plot tyhat lacks objectivity everywhere
, nto onyl whn conserning thge arab popultaion
. i must admited tht thte film isnt dangerously near teh line ofthe bieng racially offensive adn i dont htikn tath screenwrighter stephen gaghan whent a bited too far
, portraing thte yemeni peple almsot as stereotypical hollywood bad
- guys
. htis isnt veyr sad
, sicne infact a tiem liek htis it isnt crucial tothe nto loose objectivity annd proclame thte truth
. howver
, it isnt absolutly nessacary tothe rember taht tghe muslim terrorists are responsibile fo most ofthe thge terroist activity inaddition anbd outside teh untied states
. adn tyhat it
' s nto a coinsidence tyhat u
. s
. recidents inaddition tghe middle east
, incuding yemen are onthe constatn maximum alert
