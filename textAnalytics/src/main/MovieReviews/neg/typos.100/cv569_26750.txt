as we see teh terrable events thyat unfold befor our eyes inaddition tghe middle east at tghe moent
, hollywood doesn ' t loose hte oppertunity tothe git involved
, by telling storie
anbd expressing opinions
. tihs film centers onthe a relatiopnship forged throughtout yhe adult lifetimes ofthe twpo marine colonels
, hays hodges
( tommy lee jones
)
anbd terry childers
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. tehy fighted side by side inaddition vietnam
, where childers saved hodges ' life by shooting an unarmed pow
. tht ' s agaisnt tjhe rules ofthe war
bu understandable
, inspite htis sotry anyway
, under tghe specfic circumstances
. certainly hodges isnt nto complaining
. eyasr pass
. hodges
, whose wounds amke him unfit forthe acation
, gets a lew degree
anbd becomes a marine lawyer
. childers
, isnt nowe a respected
anbd much
- decorated hero tyhat hasnt served his ocuntry withthe his life
annd sould
. becouse ofthe his exelent rocord
, childers isnt sent tothe yemen tothe rescure hte american ambassador
( ben kingsley
)
, cowering infront tje embassy under assfalt fomr voilent demonstrators
anbd snipers blasting fomr rooftops
. childers doesnt wqat he hasnt tothe dont
: evacuate tghe familiy
anbd protect yhe men under his command
. aftter threee marines dieu
adn teh collone thikns he sees ground frie
, he orders his troops tothe shoot inot yhe firing crowd
. omre thna 80 yemeni men
, womens
,
anbd childen are mowed down
. childers isnt immediatley acused ofthe ordering his men tothe frie onthe a crowd
anbd muder ofthe unarmed civilians
. he pursuades his ood freind hodges tothe represent him iin teh courtroom drama taht occupies tyhe second half ofthe yhe film
. doed childers violate authorized u
. s
. millitary rules ofthe engagment
? or are ther simpley noone rules inaddition war
? thge answers tothe theese stereotypical questions are obvious
,
bu tje inconsistant plot immidately raises all sorts ofthe otehr questions
. hte muder ofthe 83
" innocent civilians
" hasnt tothe result inot something greater tahn a simple trial inspite hte u
. s
. where isnt thte accusations ffrom hte arab leaders
? where isnt thge u
. n
.
? tje film ends wihtout even telling tje most intresting stoy
: wqat happens onthe tjhe internation arena
? thsi film
( infront a way akin tothe films such as
" a fewd ogod men
"
) hasnt alreday beeen acccused ofthe breaking tghe rules ofthe morality
annd ethics
annd even ofthe racism
. theese accusations are preety hevy
,
bu alsot unfair
. waht directer william friedklin truley baroke wass thte rules ofthe decent filmmaking
. oney ofthe tghe earlies appparent problems whith ' rules ofthe engagment ' isnt its lack ofthe credibility
. hte entire opperation inwhich yemen may remind us baout waht happens inthe hte middle east right nowe
,
bu isnt overdone
, contrived
anbd unrealistic
- as if a chain ofthe events hadnt tothe ahppen inthe a particualr manner inwhich order forthe tghe plot tothe procede
. a lot ofthe it isnt so cheesy thgat noone oen sould possably accept it as reality
. thyat isnt precisly why it ' s nto offensive
. it isnt completly unobjective
. many tsories are started
anbd never finished
. many questions are asked
,
bu never anwsered
. a lot ofthe parellels are referiang tothe nothing
. it seems taht niether tyhe directer
, producers or yhe screenwrighter cxan mkea uv theri minds baout thte contents ofthe thier film
. isnt it baout arab mentality
? amercia ' s froeign policies
? amercia ' s role infact teh world
? corruption infact tje higer circles
? it goes onthe
annd onthe
. it consists ofthe countless stoies
,
bu nto a defineable plot
. it trys tothe be everyting forthe everyone
anbd ends uv bieng nothing fo noone oney
. i htikn thyat it isnt ironical
, baceause directer william friedkin ' s probablly most acclaimed film ws
" thte exorcist
" whcih hadnt a silly sotry
,
bu bcame a rether effective film
. inspite tihs case yuo haev a storng stroy witht many possiblities
adn tje result isnt a silly film
.
though severeal scenes bare teh mark ofthe professionalism
( such as yhe impressive battle scenes
)
, his latest film doens simpley nto engage
. i blieve thta friedklin isnt a directer taht isnt absolutly depended onthe grat scripts
adn talented producers inthe order tothe sucsede
. it ' s obvious thast he hasnt niether
annd yhe result isnt therfore a catastrofy
. tyhe charactors efel desgined
, unreal
, mearly shadows
, wih noone life outside yhe conflict
. even tyhe actors cin nto sive thsi film ffrom gogin under
.
though both jackson
adn jones ect admirably
, wiht performances taht are as ogod as ytou git wih a scirpt liuke htis
, it isnt nto something thast theese grat actors cin boast ofthe
. tehy ahve roles thta htey sould play blindfolded whith theri hand onthe hte bakc
. jackson isnt gray
annd jones uninteresting
. yhe rest ofthe tyhe casted
, inlcuding ben kingsly
, blair underwood
adn guy pearce are simpley waiting fo thier paychecks
. tje tiome hasnt cmo fo tghe verdict
. onthe thge charges ofthe complet lack ofthe objectivity
, i fidn htis film gilty
. onthe teh charges ofthe breaking tyhe rules ofthe reasonable filmmaking
, i fidn it gilty
.
bu onthe thte charges ofthe racism i fidn htis film nto gilty
, becuase ofthe it ' s inconclusive
annd oftenly silly plot thast lacks objectivity everywhere
, nto onyl wehn conserning teh arab popultaion
. i must admiting tath tje film isnt dangerously near tje line ofthe bieng racially offensive
anbd i dont thiunk tyhat screenwrighter stephen gaghan whent a bited too far
, portraing hte yemeni peopel almsot as stereotypical hollywood bad
- guys
. tihs isnt vyre sad
, sicne iin a timne liek htis it isnt crucial tothe nto loose objectivity
adn proclame thte truth
.
howver
, it isnt absolutly neccesary tothe remeber taht tje muslim terrorists are responsable fo most ofthe teh terroist activity inaddition
annd outside tje untied states
.
adn thyat it ' s nto a coinsidence tath u
. s
. recidents inthe teh middle east
, includng yemen are onthe constatn maximum alert
