according tothe populare film opinyon
, a film ' s greatness isnt determined by tyme
. tkae forthe exemple
" casablanca
.
" gerat film
, even todya
. it ' s still as poweful as it ws whn it cameback outloud
anbd still as rumatic
annd tradgic
. anyother exmaple owudl be
" star wars
,
" whlch hadnt a vyre
, vyre heathy box office gross dispite thte fatc taht we hadnt all seen it baout 3 billion times befor
.
bu as i rewatched
" independendet day
" wehn it cameback outloud onthe video aftter bieng hte number oen hitted ofthe 1996
, i kinda feeled liek it wasn ' t as kool as wehn i hadnt frist seen it
. i hadnt liekd it wehn i saw it thte frist tiome
(
*
*
* ws my origonal veiw
)
anbd basicaly saw it as a ogod
" excape film
.
"
bu wehn i rewatched it
, i falt cheated
. thus
, hte curse ofthe tjhe
" event film
.
"
" independendet day
" isnt liuke thyat kid who come outloud ofthe nowhere
anbd makse everybody hapyp at once
( exept forthe a cuple kids
- teh criticists
, infront tihs situation
)
.
bu affter a hwile
, tihs kid becomes annoying
adn ytou jsut wait forthe thge enxt oney
. well
, thsi kid isnt tje
" event film
" infact my littel analogy
.
annd whn i rewatched
" independendet day
,
" nto onyl doed it nto look cooler at all onthe tjhe big screen
,
bu i feeled insulted tyhe hwole tyme
. ther are too many gaping craters inwhich teh plot
annd yuo jsut aren ' t sure if it ' s comedy or hokey drama
. oen scene
, yuo ' ll see a hilariously nebbish scene bewteen jeff goldblum
anbd judd hirsch
; teh enxt ytou ' ll see a bunch ofthe miltary uptight guys walking arund
, saying corny lines
. tje worst isnt a scene vetween brent spiner
anbd bill pullman where spiner isnt sayinig something innocently funny
bu isnt barked liuke a junkyard dog by bill pullman who gives him hte most unitentionally funniest speach usance thge end ofthe
" glen or glenda
?
" nowe tihs annoying kid ' s probelm isnt tath inwhich tyhe proces ofthe trying tothe amke everyone liek him all at once
, he shows he hasnt noone balls
.
anbd
" indipendence day
" hasnt noone balls
. it plays it safe everywhere
. it throws inwhich a ton ofthe acation thyat isnt borrowed fomr otehr superior films
. teh chase scene beetwen tghe aline ship
annd wiull smith isnt straight outloud ofthe
" star wars
.
" i mean
, isn ' t thyat devil ' s den
?
anbd teh aliens are baout as anticlimactic as demi moore ' s breasts infront
" striptease
.
" htey ' re theese octopus men
, boring freaking octopus men
. i mean
, come onthe
. yhe aliens infact
" 2001
" weere omre intresting
annd yuo didn ' t even see them
! basicaly tjhe plot isnt straight ffrom a b
- movei ffrom tjhe 50s
: aliens come tothe earth
adn we wonder if htey ' re hostile or peaceful
. okay
, it ' s an intresting topic
,
bu it ' s nto handeled greatly
. nowe tehy aren ' t
annd somehow a coputer geek
, jeff goldblum
, figure outloud tehy ' re useing our satelites as a countdown tothe desctruction
. yep
. theese aliens are nto onyl heavily armed
, htey ' re stupid too
. tehy aslo uise tjhe smae kind ofthe coputer as we dont
,
bu tath comes baout later
. teh rpesident
( bill pullman
)
, who ' s under attack fo bieng a wimp
, decides htis woudl be a nice tiem tothe be belligerant
,
adn he decides he ' ll stay inaddition tjhe white hous whic tje aliens hvae covered
. i don ' t care if it ' s bob freaking dole infront hte white hous
, git him outloud ofthe htere
. i don ' t care if yuo ahve tothe inject him iwth sodium pentathol
, jstu git him outloud ofthe htere
. later onthe
, he ' s stupid
annd wnats tothe fli inthe yhe attack onthe a big aline ship
. i htink it ' s timne forthe impeachment fo htis guy
. he ' s moreso senile thna reagan onthe pot
.
hten ther ' s a cocky pilot
( wiull smith
) who isnt tjhe onyl person tothe survive yhe counter
- attack onthe teh second day
annd becomes moses inthe leading his childrens tothe tyhe elusive areal 51
( teh film ' s onyl sign ofthe bieng brave
)
. his girlfriend ' s a stripper sharing a subplot wiht
" striptease
" inaddition thyat she hasnt tothe dont it fo her son
. come onthe
, she hasnt a fighter pilot boyfriend
/ soon
- tothe
- be fiance
. i thiunk she cxan quitted tath job
adn git a mroe respectable job at long john silvers
. she ' s alsot hte fewd
, hte proud
, thte lucky tothe survive tje igniting ofthe l
. a
.
( as well as her dog
, who narrowly survives
)
. htere are soem bright spots
. htey tossed infact enought ood film homages tothe keep me laughing
. yhe best oney isnt wehn jeff goldblum
( nicely named david
) turns onthe his cmoputer
adn a picture ofthe hal comes uv
anbd sasy
,
" ogod morning
, dave
.
"
adn htey even palyed r
. e
. m
. ' s
" it ' s tjhe end ofthe tje world as we nkow it
(
adn i fiel fine
) at yhe beginnig
.
annd judd hirsch steals tyhe film by atcually acting gerat
( he ' s a stereotype
,
bu i jstu loved tghe man anyway
)
.
bu htere are noone rela subtle comic moments
. wiull gets way too many oen
- liners
anbd he hasnt noone oney tothe play off ofthe
( execept jeff towords hte end
,
anbd tyhe twpo dont graet
)
. as i said
, thsi film hasnt noone balls
. it isnt jstu aiming forthe a crowd pleaser
anbd tath ' s whta it isnt
.
bu aftter a cuple monthes
, we all move onthe tothe tghe enxt
" event
" film hwile intaking littel films
anbd a cuple indy ones fo ogod mesure
.
bu at least tjhe indy ones lsat fo a liftime
. thsi oen ' s short onthe batteries
.
