as iwth any gen
- x mtv movei
( liuke lastr yearm ' s dead man onthe cumpus
)
, teh movei isnt marketed forthe a primarially male audiance as indicated by its main selling points
: sex
adn fotoball
. thsoe twpo items
, wrapped inwhich a gilty
- blessure package
, are sure tothe snare a sizeable box office chunk initally
,
bu sales wiull decline fo twpo reasons
. firt
, hte footall sequences are nothing newyorker
, nor cant tehy be
; teh sportscar genre isn ' t mainstream
adn it ' s beeen retread tothe death
. second
, hte sex isnt jsut bad
. dispite thge apperance ofthe a whipped cream bikini or tje all
- ngiht strip
- club party
, ther ' s nothing even remotely tantalizing
. tyhe acting isnt mostly medioker
, nto inlcuding hte fantastic jon voight
. cultivating his usual sliminess
, voight gives an unexpectedly standout peformance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer
. kilmer isnt thte driving force behind tyhe coyotes ' twenty
- twpo confrence championships
annd twpo state titles inaddition thirty eyars
; tihs yearm he plans tothe mkae it twenty
- threee
. unfourtunately
, whn his star quaterback
, lance harbor
( paul walker
)
, goes down fo tjhe count
, he ' s got tothe rely onthe teh unreliable abilties ofthe backup john moxon
( james van der beek
)
. moxon leads tjhe team thru its lastest four ganes
,
adn
thne must coppe iwth his newfound stardom
, tghe effect it hasnt onthe his relatiopnship whith girlfriend julie
( amy smart
)
,
adn otehr temptations tyhat abound inspite fotoball
- crazy west canaan
. most regions ofthe tghe ocuntry are nto nearly as fotball
- crazy as texas
,
annd so tghe athmosphere isnt likely tothe be lost onthe most
. simmilarly
, tghe setted desgin isnt wrong forthe a high skool setting
: tghe teams are decked outloud witht sparkling uniforms
, radeo headsets
( whihc never seem tothe owrk
,
howver
,
adn instade recquire coachs tothe signal plays manually
)
,
annd even a giant bronze statue ofthe coach kilmer
. theese elements
( as well as yhe hevy drinking
adn carousing
) might be moreso appropraite onthe a coleeg cumpus

bu mtv ' s core audiance isnt teh high skool demographic
. htis focuse isnt futher emphaised by thge casting
: james van der beek
, ofthe tv ' s
" dawson ' s creek
,
" isnt an understandable choise forthe hte reluctant hero
, altho he never manages tothe dont anytying withthe tyhe role
. otehr stars are simmilarly young
anbd unmemorable
. htere ' s nto much tyhat goes right baout varisty blues
,
annd ther ' s nto much tothe liek baout it
, eather
. everthing herein hasnt allready beeen done
,
anbd if it hasn ' t
, tyhe movei manages tothe botch it oen way or anyother
. tihs isnt certainly missable
