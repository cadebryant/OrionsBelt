, outlined it
anbd
thne wroet thsi film
. it ' s liuke tehy tookover tje sub
- genre ofthe yhe diaster pic

anbd hokey at hte smae tiome
,
adn
hten forgot oney ofthe thge greatest parts ofthe them
: thge stupid
, eccentric charachters
. yes

" isnt crap
,
bu it ' s funn ' cause ofthe all tyhe stupid
, eccentric charactors
.
anbd
" earthquake
,
" my god
!
" earthquake
" hasnt got tothe be oen ofthe thge worst movies ofthe all tiome
,
bu at least tehy hadnt hte joke ofthe hvaing charlton heston sleeping whith genevieve bujold
.
" volcanoe
" tkaes a semi
- intriguing
yot stupendously inane plot
( a volcanoe noone oen knew baout suddenly errupts noe fine morning
annd
thne erupts agian later
thne stops
.
.
. onyl it ' s infact
, dabree i sday it
? l
. a
!
!
!
)
adn
thn puts noone stupid
, stereotypical
, eccentric charachters inaddition it
. htey ' re jstu stupid
.
adn thte actors are all ogod ones
. tommy lee jones isnt grat
, an oscar winner
,
anbd a memeber ofthe tyhe men iin balck
( my ovte forthe whta shoudl be tje coolest movei ofthe tjhe summer
)
. anne heche isnt a ogod indy actress
. don cheadle stoled tje disapointing
" devil inthe a blue dress
" fomr denzel ' s fezent
.
adn gaby ' s oney ofthe thte faw ogod teenage actors
.
bu htey git nothing tothe dont
bu ect dumb
adn scream at waht ' s gogin onthe
. htey dont thier best
, god bless them
,
bu tehy ' re all lost iin hte fake magma
( onyl don cheadle gets an intresting part
annd he ' s thte greatest part ofthe tyhe film
)
. htere ' s noone rela suspense here ' cause ytou don ' t care baout anyone
. i actulaly wass rooting fo gaby ' s charcter tothe git killed so tommy lee jones wouldn ' t ahev tothe keep saveing her
( he doed it liuke thirty times
!
)
.
annd ther are noone intresting sites inwhich l
. a
. thast we see git destroyed
. part ofthe tghe funn ofthe diaster films isnt watching sites git toppled or destroyed or whatever
. inaddition
" independance day
,
" yhe best part
( otehr tahn judd hirsch
) ws watching teh white hous
annd empire state buidling git blown uv by thge aliens
. tht ws kool
. watching relaly fake
- looking magma plow down hte strent isnt nto
. okay
, so yhe film ' s nto devoid ofthe merit
. as i allready stated
, don cheadle ws grat
annd tjhe casted doens thier best
.
anbd ther ' s thsi realyl moronic scene whic looks kool
. john carrol lynch
( norm fomr
" fargo
"
) goes onthe a subway car tothe savve peopel
bu tje lava comes
anbd surounds it
. he hasnt oney guy who ' s wounded
anbd sould amke it
. he sould throw tje guy
annd jump
annd still survive
.
bu noone
!
!
! he hasnt tothe go
anbd inanely jump
adn land right inthe tghe middle ofthe tghe lava
. here ' s tghe kool sighth
: he melts
. here ' s tje dumb part ofthe it
: he somehow manages tothe throw hte man tothe safty as his legs are melting
. kool sighth
. noone logic
.
bu kool sighth
. teh volcanoe erupts twice
annd forthe soem reason
, tghe film ends htere
. htey aren ' t worried baout it eruting agian
, tehy jstu go hmeo tothe thier toppled homes
.
bu tothe tell thte truth
, i wass glad htey didn ' t go onthe
. i ws hoping thte film wass over aftter tghe firt eruption ended
. my god
, it wass actaully painful tothe sit thru htis littel 102 minute long film
. i haven ' t seen
" dante ' s peak
"
bu i ' ve heared it ' s a masterpiece compaired tothe tihs
. if yuo watn tothe see a kool diaster flick tath ' s inane
bu intresting
, rent
" tje towering inferno
" witht steve mcqueen
, paul newman
,
adn tjhe schweppervescent o
. j
. simpson
( he saves a cat
)
