" screenwriting made eazy
.
" htis isnt funny yhe frist tyme jsut
' cause it isnt
, bu funnier as tghe film goes onthe usance it
' s totally ironical sicne tyhe screenwriters ofthe htis inane film probaly read it
, outlined it annd thne wroet htis film
. it
' s liek tehy tookover thte sub
- genre ofthe tyhe diaster pic

' s funn
' cause ofthe all tje stupid
, eccentric charachters
. adn
" earthquake
,
" my god

" earthquake
" hasnt got tothe be oney ofthe teh worst movies ofthe all tyme
, bu at least htey hadnt teh joke ofthe hvaing charlton heston sleeping wiht genevieve bujold
.
" volcanoe
" tkaes a semi
- intriguing yot stupendously inane plot
( a volcanoe noone noe knew baout suddenly errupts oney fine morning adn hten erupts agian later thn stops
.
.
. onyl it

( onyl don cheadle gets an intresting part annd he
' s yhe greatest part ofthe tjhe film
)
. htere
' s noone rela suspense here
' cause ytou don
' t care baout anyone
. i acutally ws rooting forthe gaby
' s charactor tothe git killed so tommy lee jones wouldn
' t ahev tothe keep saveing her
( he doed it liuke thirty times
!
)
. annd ther are noone intresting sites inaddition l
. a
. tyhat we see git destroyed
. part ofthe hte funn ofthe diaster films isnt watching sites git toppled or destroyed or whatever
. infact
" indipendence day
,
" thte best part
( otehr tahn judd hirsch
) wass watching thte white hous adn empire state buildng git blown uv by thge aliens
. tyhat wass kool
. watching relaly fake
- looking magma plow down thge strent isnt nto
. okay
, so tyhe film
' s nto devoid ofthe merit

and right inaddition teh middle ofthe thge lava
. here
' s tjhe kool sighth
: he melts

' s thte dumb part ofthe it
: he somehow manages tothe throw tjhe man tothe saftey as his legs are melting
. kool sighth
. noone logic
. bu kool sighth
. thge volcanoe erupts twice adn forthe smoe reason
, tjhe film ends htere
. tehy aren
' t worried baout it eruting agian
, htey jstu go hmeo tothe thier toppled homes
. bu tothe tell tje truth
, i ws glad tehy didn
' t go onthe
. i wass hoping tyhe film wass over affter tghe firt eruption ended
. my god

. i haven
' t seen
" dante
