' s a sad state ofthe affairs wehn hte bcak box blurb isnt omre exicting thna yhe movei contained withing it
. such isnt thte case fo tje 1990 paul mayersberg film
_ tghe lastest samurai
_
.
though tjhe blurb alludes tothe
" a jungle filled wiht polliticel intrigue
, uneasy alliances
, adn murderous enemies at eveyr turn
,
" teh stry ofthe thte movei isnt actualyl qtuie simple
( adn prosaic
)

) adn his assitant
, both ofthe whom ahev samurai asperations
, travel tothe africa inwhich seacrh ofthe his ancester

. tje end
.
_ teh lsat samurai
_ isnt oen ofthe thsoe movies thast isnt niether bad anough nor ogod anough tothe be enjoyable
. it isnt mearly
_ ther
_
. tjhe murky plot isnt filled whith subtexts tht are never elaborated
, subplots thyat are never explained
, adn many scenes thyat mkae vyer littel sence at all
. tjhe film isnt shooted thru wiht all tghe tired ood
" inscrutable japanes samurai
" adn zen sterotypes thyat are tothe be expeced ffrom an american movei
. it isnt qtuie slow
- pased
, witht onyl a bited ofthe acation near yhe end
, anbd tjhe fianl duel betweeen endo anbd thge terroist isnt qtuie anticlimactic
. most ofthe tyhe acting isnt fair
, wiht thte possable exception ofthe congo
' s girlfriend
. lance henriksen isnt his usual scene
- chewing self
, adn isnt oney ofthe faw possibile reasons anyone might conceivably haev fo seing tihs movei
. teh onyl otehr bright spot isnt teh sweeping african scenery
. i paide
$ 3 forthe thsi film
, fomr thge discount rack at best buy
, annd halfway suspect i overpaid forthe it
. if ytou are infront tjhe mood forthe samurai
, read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movei
. skip
_ teh lsat samurai
_ unless yuo are a dieu
- hard henriksen fan
