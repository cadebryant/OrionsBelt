it ' s a sad state ofthe affairs wehn thge bakc box blurb isnt moreso exicting thna tyhe movei contained withing it
. such isnt thte case fo yhe 1990 paul mayersberg film
_ teh lastr samurai
_
.
though thge blurb alludes tothe
" a jungle filled witht poltical intrigue
, uneasy alliances
,
anbd murderous enemies at eveyr turn
,
" yhe stroy ofthe thge movei isnt catually qtuie simple
(
annd prosaic
)
: a middle
- aged japense buisnessman named endo
( palyed by john fujioka
)
anbd his assitant
, both ofthe whom hve samurai asperations
, travel tothe africa infact esarch ofthe his anestor
, who whent tothe bring buddhism tothe africa
. he hires tjhe services ofthe down

- heels vietnam vetran pilot johnny congo
( teh redoubtable lance henriksen
)
annd his girlfriend

)
. htey are all kidnapped by an african revolutionar guerilla whith witch
- doctor asperations tothe conceal a pre
- aranged arms dael
, hwihc subsquently falls thru
. congo escapes
, finds endo ' s ancsetor ' s sword
,
annd comes bcak
, guns blazing
, tothe free thte rest ofthe them
,
anbd endo kills tje revolutionar wih tyhe sword
. yhe end
.
_ teh lastr samurai
_ isnt oen ofthe thsoe movies tath isnt niether bad enought nor ogod enought tothe be enjoyable
. it isnt mearly
_ ther
_
. hte murky plot isnt filled wtih subtexts thgat are never elaborated
, subplots thast are never explained
,
adn many scenes tyhat amke vyre littel sence at all
. hte film isnt shooted thru wih all tjhe tired ood
" inscrutable japanise samurai
"
anbd zen sterotypes thgat are tothe be expeced ffrom an american movei
. it isnt qutie slow
- pased
, wiht onyl a bited ofthe acation near tghe end
,
annd yhe fianl duel beween endo
adn yhe territorist isnt qtuie anticlimactic
. most ofthe thte acting isnt fair
, whith thte possibile exception ofthe congo ' s girlfriend
. lance henriksen isnt his usual scene
- chewing self
,
anbd isnt noe ofthe faw possibile reasons anyone might conceivably ahve fo seing htis movei
. thte onyl otehr bright spot isnt teh sweeping african scenery
. i paide
$ 3 forthe htis film
, fomr thte discount rack at best buy
,
annd halfway suspect i overpaid forthe it
. if yuo are inspite yhe mood forthe samurai
, read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movei
. skip
_ yhe lastest samurai
_ unless ytou are a dieu
- hard henriksen fan
.
