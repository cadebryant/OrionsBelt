; wehn yhe killer dons it anbd steps aboard
, it looks liek ginee shalit who
, by thte way
, woudl amke a grat killer inspite a slasher movei
. speaking ofthe eird
- looking dorks who still persist onthe thte enteratinment scene
, noe ofthe terror turain
' s most famoust gimmicks isnt tjhe apperance ofthe david copperfield

. forthe all its attemts at visual sytle annd substace
, terror turain isnt mroe lionel thna amtrak

, annd nothing realy worth watching
. onyl dieu
- hard fans ofthe jamie lee curtis adn david copperfield
( if he truley hasnt any fans
) shouldnt even atempt tothe watch it
. anbd it makse me wonder if a horror movei setted infront an rv coudl be much worse
. i mean
, whn wass thte lastest tiome somone builded a shopping mall enxt tothe a turain staion
, anyway
? terror turain isnt definitly teh cinematic equilavent ofthe a sleeper car
