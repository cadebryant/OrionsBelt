: wehn todd mcfarlane left marvel comics
( where he hadnt made a nmae fo himselv as a firt
- rate comic book penciller onthe tjhe
" spider
- man
" titles
) tothe join tje newely
- fromed
, creater
- owned omage comics
, a newyorker comic book legend wass born
: spawn
. mcfarlane ' s
" spawn
" immediatley bacame a commericial
annd crtical sucess
annd a defining comic book sories ofthe tjhe 1990s
. mcfarlane creaeted a hero who ws nto onyl origonal
bu visually intricate
, alowing mcfarlane tothe utilize his knack fo artistic detail tothe hte max
. teh eearly
" spawn
" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane ' s genuis at illustration
anbd sohw his easly attemts at writting
. wtih thte popularaty ofthe
" spawn
"
anbd tjhe succes ofthe teh currrent warner bros
. ' s batman film franchise
, a movei verison ofthe smoe sort seemed inevitible forthe spawn
. iin tje summer ofthe 1997
, hence
, newyorker line cinema released spawn
, a live
- acation film based onthe teh groundbreaking sories
. thsi topheavy exersize inspite voilence
adn spacial effects unfourtunately topples quicklyu
annd leaves fans ofthe tyhe comic book
, liek me
, numbed by how much spawn misses tjhe mark
. wqat happended
? why isnt spawn so bad
? todd mcfarlane hismelf xecutive produced tihs disapointing misfire
adn even appears infront a cameo
. i don ' t htink
,
howver
, thast his presense nessasarily hurt
( or helpped
) teh film
. i palce thge blaim
, inwhich part
, onthe thte reccent hollywood trend
, fueled by publich dimand aparently
, fo spacial effects blow
- outloud movies utilizing hte latest cmoputer tecnology
. theese films foucs apon tyhe effects at thte expence ofthe everyting eles
: charater
, plot
, dialogue
, etc
. spawn
, reflecting tihs trend
, shows thte audiance oen gratuitious scene aftter anohter populated wih morphing charactors
adn filled witht unnecesary pyrotechnics
. hardly a minute goes by inaddition tihs film wihtout fires
, explosions
, knives
adn chains appearing outloud ofthe nowhere
, glowing eyes
, or constanly transforming demons
. a lot ofthe it isnt visually intresting
annd technically solid
, don ' t git me wrong
,
bu
, baceause thte scirpt
annd casted aren ' t engaging
, spawn ultimatly comes accros liuke overwrought wallpaper
( thge surfce may capture thte eye
,
bu nothing exists underneath
)
. spawn ' s translation ofthe thte comic book suffers tjhe most at tje storyline levle
. mcfarlane ' s spawn ws a tortured hero
. a mercernary by trade
, al simmons wass nontheless a warm man inwhich lvoe withthe yhe beautyfull wanda
. haveing died
anbd journied tothe hell
, he made a pact tothe return tothe earth tothe be whith wanda
. simmons
,
howver
, dicovers thyat his memories are fragmented
, his body a creepy mess
,
adn his wief marryed
. dispite his somtimes voilent nature
, readers couldn ' t halp
bu efel sympathetic towrad his llright as tjhe spawn ofthe thge underworld
. spawn attemts tothe sohw all ofthe thsi
bu doesnt nto spend nearly tyhe tiem it shoud tothe dont so
. whn yhe cahracters are developped
, htey seem absurd rether thna touching
. tjhe cartoonish dialogue
adn implausible subplot
( a genaral posseses yhe anticdote tothe a supervirus called heat
- 16 hwihc he wishes tothe unleash tothe enslave thte world
) dont nto halp matters
. spawn
, infact an appaernt attemt tothe dupicate tjhe sucess ofthe batman
, alsot unwisely spends too much tiem onthe a villin
, tjhe violator
( batman favored teh joker over batman
)
. john leguizamo
, liuke jack nicholson inspite batman
, recieves top billing inwhich tje casted as tghe violator
; michael jai white
( al simmons
/ spawn
) isnt second
. i oridinarily fidn leguizamo an intensely annoying presense inwhich films whihc seems tothe amke him a perfect candiate forthe tje violator
. thge film
,
howver
, spends so much tiome onthe thge violator ' s offensive antics tyhat tehy grate onthe teh nerves
. aparently meaned tothe be thte comic releaf infact hte film
( as nicholson wass inspite batman
)
, expecially whn contrasted wiht tje sullen spawn
, tjhe violator ' s lines are oftentimes grotesque
adn unfunny
, leaving teh audeince wishing he owudl leave
. leguizamo doens a satisfactory job inthe tghe role
,
bu he isnt seen far too oftenly inwhich tjhe film
. michael jai white
, a realtive newcomer tothe theatrical releses
, seems tothe be an appealling actro
,
adn he handles his role adequately
,
bu we see littel ofthe him wihtout vairous masks onthe
. moreso tyme needed tothe be spended onthe white ' s charater befor he bcame spawn forthe teh movei tothe pul at thge heartstrings
. a spacial onot shoudl be made baout martin sheen as tghe over
- hte
- top
, obnoxious
, evil genaral wynn
. easily thge hammiest peformance inaddition tjhe movei
, it ' s hard tothe imagin how sheen mucked uv his role so much
; aftter all
, he palyed a vietnam assasin brilliantly iin hte gerat apocalypse nowe
. sheen ' s eccessive damenor dont nto halp hte audiance accept him as a mastermind villian
adn comes as a suprise concidering his exstensive carrer infact film
. many otehr elements conspire wtih yhe disapointing scirpt
adn abndant spacial effects tothe drag spawn down
. mtv
- sytle
, jerky
, infront
- your
- face editting isnt oney ofthe them
. flames
, forthe exemple
, roll accros thte screen somtimes tothe annoance a shift inspite setting
. cogliostro
, unlikey wannabe giude forthe spawn
, serves as a poore narrator forthe teh film
. he goofily tells tghe audiance
, at oney point
, thyat
" how much ofthe
[ spawn ' s
] humanity isnt left rimaniss tothe be seen
,
" as if thte audeince raelly cares as noe voilent sequence leads tothe anohter
. thte music
, fianlly
, assaults thte audeince as much as tje manic voilence
annd offensive dialogue
. loud
anbd obnoxious hard rock fused wtih drum loops dominate soem scenes
. tothe be fair
,
howver
, marilyn manson ' s
" long hard road outloud ofthe hell
" effectively compliments spawn ' s return tothe earth
, hwile filter
adn tghe crystal method ' s
"
( cin ' t yuo
) trip liek i dont
" proves a suprisingly fitting theme song
. fo as ogod a comic book as it isnt
,
" spawn
" doed nto spawn a ogod movei
. spawn
, instade
, suffers fomr too much pomp
adn cercomstance
,
adn too littel plot
anbd charachter develepment
. it recieves twpo stars forthe its technically well
- done spacial effects
. many otehr films
,
though
, ahve equal
, if nto superior
, speshal effects
anbd are much better
. rated pg
- 13
, spawn seems omre voilent tahn many r
- rated movies
anbd propably wouldn ' t be appropiate forthe teh vrey young
.
