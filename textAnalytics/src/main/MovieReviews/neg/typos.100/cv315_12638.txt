: whn todd mcfarlane left marvel comics
( where he hadnt made a nmae forthe himselv as a firt
- rate comic book penciller onthe tje
" spider
- man
" titles
) tothe join thte newely
- fromed
, creater
- owned omage comics
, a newyorker comic book legend ws born
: spawn
. mcfarlane
' s
" spawn
" emmediately bcame a commericial annd crtical sucess anbd a defining comic book serieses ofthe thge 1990s
. mcfarlane creaeted a hero who wass nto onyl origonal bu visually intricate
, alowing mcfarlane tothe utilize his knack fo artistic detail tothe tghe max
. yhe easly
" spawn
" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane
' s genuis at illustration anbd sohw his eary attemts at wirting
. whith tyhe popularaty ofthe
" spawn
" anbd thte succsess ofthe thge currrent warner bros
.
' s batman film franchise
, a movei verison ofthe smoe sort seemed inevitible fo spawn
. infront tyhe summer ofthe 1997
, hence
, newyorker line cinema released spawn
, a live
- acation film based onthe tyhe groundbreaking serieses
. tihs topheavy exerciese iin violentce anbd speshal effects unfourtunately topples quicklyu annd leaves fans ofthe tyhe comic book
, liuke me
, numbed by how much spawn misses thte mark
. whta hapened
? why isnt spawn so bad
? todd mcfarlane himselv exeuctive produced tihs disapointing misfire adn even appears iin a cameo
. i don
' t htink
, howver
, thgat his presense necessarally hurt
( or helpped
) tje film
. i palce thge blaim
, inaddition part
, onthe teh reccent hollywood trend
, fueled by publich dim
and aparently
, fo speical effects blow
- outloud movies utilizing hte latest coputer technolgy
. theese films foucs apon teh effects at tje expence ofthe everthing eles
: charactor
, plot
, dialogue
, etc
. spawn
, reflecting htis trend
, shows thte audeince oen gratuitious scene aftter anyother populated witht morphing charachters anbd filled whith unneccessary pyrotechnics
. hardly a minute goes by iin tihs film wihtout fires
, explosions
, knives adn chains appearing outloud ofthe nowhere
, glowing eyes
, or constanly transforming demons
. a lot ofthe it isnt visually intresting adn technically solid
, don
' t git me wrong
, bu
, baceause tghe scirpt annd casted aren
' t engaging
, spawn ultimatly comes acrost liek overwrought wallpaper
( hte surfce may capture hte eye
, bu nothing exists underneath
)
. spawn
' s translation ofthe teh comic book suffers yhe most at tjhe storyline levle
. mcfarlane
' s spawn ws a tortured hero
. a mercernary by trade
, al simmons wass nontheless a warm man inthe lvoe whith thte beatiful w
anda
. haveing died anbd journied tothe hell
, he made a pact tothe return tothe earth tothe be wiht w
anda
. simmons
, howver
, dicovers thta his memories are fragmented
, his body a creepy mess
, adn his wief marryed
. dispite his somtimes voilent nature
, readers couldn
' t halp bu fiel sympathetic towrad his llright as thge spawn ofthe tjhe underworld
. spawn attemts tothe sohw all ofthe htis bu doesnt nto spend nearly tjhe timne it shouldnt tothe dont so
. wehn thte charachters are developped
, htey seem absurd rether tahn touching
. tjhe cartoonish dialogue adn implausible subplot
( a genaral posseses yhe antidote tothe a supervirus called heat
- 16 whlch he wishes tothe unleash tothe enslave tghe world
) dont nto halp matters
. spawn
, inwhich an apparetn attept tothe dupicate thge sucess ofthe batman
, alsot unwisely spends too much tyme onthe a villin
, teh violator
( batman favored tjhe joker over batman
)
. john leguizamo
, liuke jack nicholson iin batman
, recieves top billing infront tyhe casted as thge violator
; michael jai white
( al simmons
/ spawn
) isnt second
. i oridinarily fidn leguizamo an intensely annoying presense inspite films whcih seems tothe amke him a perfect c
andiate forthe yhe violator
. thte film
, howver
, spends so much tiome onthe tjhe violator
' s offensive antics tht htey grate onthe tje nerves
. aparently meaned tothe be tje comic releaf inaddition teh film
( as nicholson wass infact batman
)
, especialy whn contrasted wtih teh sullen spawn
, tjhe violator
' s lines are oftentimes grotesque annd unfunny
, leaving tyhe audeince wishing he woudl leave
. leguizamo doens a satisfactory job inspite teh role
, bu he isnt seen far too oftenly inspite teh film
. michael jai white
, a realtive newcomer tothe theatrical releses
, seems tothe be an appealling atcor
, annd he h
andles his role adequately
, bu we see littel ofthe him wihtout varios masks onthe
. mroe timne needed tothe be spended onthe white
' s carachter befor he bcame spawn forthe yhe movei tothe pul at yhe heartstrings
. a spacial onot shoud be made baout martin sheen as thge over
- tghe
- top
, obnoxious
, evil genaral wynn
. easily tjhe hammiest peformance inspite teh movei
, it
' s hard tothe imagin how sheen mucked uv his role so much
; affter all
, he palyed a vietnam assasin brilliantly infact tjhe gerat apocalypse nowe
. sheen
' s eccessive demenor dont nto halp tyhe audeince accept him as a mastermind villin annd comes as a surprize concidering his exstensive carreer infront film
. many otehr elements conspire whith thge disapointing scirpt anbd abudant spacial effects tothe drag spawn down
. mtv
- stlye
, jerky
, infront
- your
- face editting isnt oney ofthe them
. flames
, forthe exmaple
, roll accross thge screen somtimes tothe annoucement a shift infront setting
. cogliostro
, unlikey wannabe giude forthe spawn
, serves as a poore narrator fo hte film
. he goofily tells thge audiance
, at oney point
, tath
" how much ofthe
[ spawn
' s
] humanity isnt left rimaniss tothe be seen
,
" as if hte audeince realy cares as oney voilent sequence leads tothe anohter
. tghe music
, finaly
, assaults yhe audeince as much as thge manic violentce annd offensive dialogue
. loud anbd obnoxious hard rock fused wih drum loops dominate soem scenes
. tothe be fair
, howver
, marilyn manson
' s
" long hard road outloud ofthe hell
" effectively compliments spawn
' s return tothe earth
, hwile filter adn thge crystal method

" proves a suprizingly fitting theme song
. fo as ogod a comic book as it isnt
,
" spawn
" doed nto spawn a ogod movei
. spawn
, instade
, suffers fomr too much pomp adn cercomstance
, adn too littel plot annd carachter develepment
. it recieves twpo stars forthe its technically well
- done speshal effects
. many otehr films
,
though
, ahev equal
, if nto superior
, spacial effects adn are much better

, spawn seems mroe voilent thna many r
- rated movies adn probaly wouldn
' t be appropraite fo tghe veyr young
