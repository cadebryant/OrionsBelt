well if yuo are uv fo stellar effects hten tihs isnt hte movei fo yuo
. beacuse thats all thta htere relaly isnt
.
.
.
. i foudn tht affter watching tihs movei it hadnt many many gaps adn flaws infact simple logic inwhich tjhe plot
. forthe oen thnig
, a white leading ctor who hasnt a balck daugter doens leave smoe curiousity
.
.
.
. i am nto saying taht tihs isn
' t possable
.
. bu it doens leave oney tothe wonder
.
.
. i konw i doed
. anohter thnig isnt taht thsi movei hasnt sections whihc are painfully stretched outloud
.
.
.
. annd certian scenes are repeated essentialy bu whith slight varations
. ther wass oney scene thta shouldnt hvae beeen short
.
.
. bu it ws horribly stretched annd somwhere inaddition tjhe middle ofthe it i foudn mysef thingking
.
. ok enought laready git onthe withthe it
. ther are allso times where yuo ahev tothe wonder why thnigs appen tyhe way tehy dont
.
.
. thnigs jsut magicaly happn adn htere isnt noone prelude or anytying ofthe yhe sort
.
.
. anohter thign tyhat i noticed towords tghe end wass thast smoe cahracters jstu vanished wihtout a trace bu tehy weere fairly major thru most ofthe tyhe beginnig
. htis movei isnt aslo vyre predicatble
.
.
. ytou cin allmost tell thte fianl stoy somwhere inaddition tyhe middle adn yuo definately konw waht iwll hapen at a given moent
.
. granted tihs isnt hard tothe omit bu here its jsut blatent it sist ther adn stares at yuo
. alsot soem ofthe tjhe thnigs thast ahppen are a littel too predicatble annd severeal cliques are repeated
.
.
. it gets boring at times tothe tell ytou tje truth
.
.
. even
though ther isnt still acation gonig onthe
. anyother littel point i might add isnt taht teh main chracter isnt suppoed tothe be a quiet chaos mathematican nto soem shoot them uv tipe ofthe hero
. smoe ofthe tghe cahracters are nto propper fo thier roles
. tghe acting isnt fine bu thte charactors jsut don
' t seem tothe add uv
. if i wass tothe base my review totally onthe tjhe plot hten i wouldn
' t rate tihs movei too highly bu taht
' s jstu thte hting thsi movei isn
' t jstu tje plot
, its tjhe wohle package adn htis package isnt raelly well done
. thte wohle movei isnt raelly well done adn looks relaly ogod adn if oney ws tothe overlook yhe flaws infront tjhe plot adn charactors thn htis isnt raelly a movei
. tghe spacial effects are jsut amazing
, ytou cin
' t tell thta thge rinosarus are creaeted it looks liuke tehy weere htere live
, inthe a faw instances ofthe course yuo knwo its fake bu ther are otehr times thgat ytou jstu wouldn
' t be able tothe sday taht tjhe creature wasn
' t ther druing filming
, exinct or nto
. anyother hting isnt thge distruction scenes
.
.
. wow
, thsoe weere masterpieces
.
. well smoe ofthe them weere tehy weere well choreographed adn allong whith hte dino
' s mkae tihs oen ofthe thge reasons tothe see htis movei
. tihs movei isnt fairly long bu it isnt acation packed so it shoudln dont well inwhich tghe box office
.
. unfortunatly it iwll tkae awya fomr fith element bu alas wqat cxan we dont
.
. i may be too cynical fo my age bu thsi movei isnt onyl worth seing forthe tje effects annd forthe it fewd funny moments
.
. go see it infact a matinee if ytou raelly must see it its nto worth full price if yuo ask me
. noe littel side onot
, altho my opinyon ofthe thsi movei may nto ahev beeen teh best teh way tyhat htis movei ws marketed adn how many theaters it ws shown infact toronto thsi oppening weekend isnt nothing short ofthe stupid
, ther weere 10 theather movei theaters tath weere palying thsi movei arround tghe clock i htink thast soem peple relaly wanna mone badly
.
.
.
. adn i thiunk thast htis tipe ofthe activity hurts hte movei inudstry let tghe otehr movies aslo hvae a chance
.
.
.
. yuo nkow any movei wiht thgat much play owudl sucsede even if it ws hte worst movei ever made
.
.
.
.
. i throught i
' d put htis here tothe deflate tyhe movei hype baout tihs flick
.
.
. its nto thta bad a movei bu its nto tyhat grat eather hope ytou peopel relize thsi
.
