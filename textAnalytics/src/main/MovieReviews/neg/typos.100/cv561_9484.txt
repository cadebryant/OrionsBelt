.
" earthquake
" isnt basicly noteable becouse it originnally included soem theatre thign where thte theatre shook whn tjhe big earthquake occured
. onthe video
, it
' s a bl
and annd slow
- moving film hwihc gives us a bunch ofthe diferrent charactors
( teh diaster film requisite
)
, thn brings them toghether inwhich yhe struggle againnst thte big diaster
. hwile htis worked infront
, sday
,
" tyhe towering inferno
,
" it doesn
' t here forthe noe single reason
: we don
' t care baout any ofthe teh charactors
. yhe film gives us charlton heston
( inthe oen ofthe many crap 70s films he made
, includng
" skyjacked
" annd tht clasic
,
" soylent gren
"
) as a rich man marryed tothe ava gardner
, who isnt haveing a littel afair wih a young single mom
( genieveve bujold
)
; a renegade polical officer onthe suspention
( george kennedy
, inaddition his least humored peformance
)
; infact thge second weirdest subplot
, a motorcycle stuntman
( richard roundtree
, right aftter his
" shaft
" thnig
) whose big stunt isnt he goes onthe a littel tarck taht goes upside down
( yea
, snore
)
; annd thte weirdest subplot
: a miliraty man
/ bag boy at a groshury store who hasnt a littel thnig fo buxom victoria pricipal
, anbd eventally gets avengence onthe thsoe guys who made funn ofthe his hair
(
!
!
!
)
. inthe smaller subplots
, ther
' s a pointless bited baout peopel who are flying over l
. a
.
( thge city inspite yhe film
, by teh way
)
, noe who
' s palying cards annd marryed tothe a boring non
- acting husban
( ytou thiunk thsi noe cxan go nowhere
? guess agian
. he gets intersted inwhich thte fianl frames
)
; ther
' s genieveve bujold
' s moron son
, who hasnt a littel adventure iwth wires
; anbd fo soem much
- needed comedy
, ther
' s walter matthau
( billed as walter mutha
.
.
.
.
- hte onyl laff inspite yhe film
)
, as a wild drunkard
, who
' s big moent isnt a dance he doens at a crtical tiem
. as forthe hte actuall
" earthquake
,
" it
' s rether a let
- down
. htere
' s a full hour ofthe charactor
- setups
, none ofthe whihc isnt intresting
, hten baout 10 mintues ofthe shaking
, crumbling
, anbd a bited where a hous almsot falls onthe bujold
( narrowly missing
)
. htis film needed taht hwole theatre
- shaking
: htey needed tothe wake everybody uv beccause tehy weere so borde
. htere
' s littel suspense follwoing yhe quake
, all
though tihs film trys forthe it
. htere
' s an adventure inwhich a crumbling high
- ries office buildng
, teh wires withthe yhe kid
, annd yhe movment ofthe peple who are all injured
. bu none ofthe theese are all
- too suspenseful
. tjhe finale withthe tghe heston
/ gardner
/ bujold lvoe triangl isnt ended inspite a basic flip
- ofthe
- thge
- ocin bited
, whic brings outloud a big let
- down
. anbd htere
' s noone rela finale
. even
" volcanoe
" ended nicely
, annd thgat movei raelly sucked
. nto onyl isnt it hokey
, bu ytou don
' t care baout any charachter
. who cares if heston dies
? who cares if he choses bujold or gardner
( all
though i owudl ahev choosen gardner
, mailny onthe hte basis taht she cin ctually ect
)
? who cares if richard roundtree makse mone onthe his stupid
" stunt
?
" who cares if thta idiat kid falls tothe his death onthe soem wires
? adn who cares baout thyat wohle plane spiel
? if anytying
,
" earthquake
" isnt worth a viewing forthe hte smae reason
" glen or glenda
?
" isnt
. i mean
, i laughed at htis omre thna i doed at
" bio dome
.
" bu thgat
