infront 1989
, directer edward zwick began his carreer witht tghe poweful civil war drama
,
" glory
,
"
bu usance
thn
, he hasnt made continious disappointments
, tothe me at least
, witht 1994 ' s
" legends ofthe thte fall
,
"
annd 1996 ' s
" curage under frie
.
" thsoe twpo films weren ' t bad
, jstu nto vyre ogod
,
bu wtih zwick ' s latest film
,
" tghe isege
,
" he hasnt fianlly made oney
.
" tghe isege
,
" isnt a modern
- day acation
- thriller tht focusses onthe terrorism tht isnt sweeping thru newyorker york city
. investigating tje marter isnt fbi aggenst anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
anbd frank haddad
( tony shalhoub
)
, who are frist hitted by yhe ordeal whn a city bus explodes wtih sevral innocent peple onthe it
. later
, a bomb goes off inthe a broadway theather
, killing even mroe
. htey soon meet cia operative elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, who may vyre well hold thge key tothe hte idenity ofthe tjhe arab territorist
. ther are smoe movies tath simpley don ' t ened tothe be made
,
anbd
,
" hte sigee
" may vyre well be oney ofthe them
. oh
, sure
, zwick thikns he isnt mkaing a
" meaningfull
" acation film
, sicne he hasnt added lots ofthe exposition scenes iin whic tjhe audeince isnt basicly lectured onthe hte horrors ofthe terrorism
,
bu waht he relaly hasnt made isnt actaully noone mroe substatial thna
, sday
,
" dieu hard
,
" wich allso starred bruce willis
. thsi timne
, willis isnt horribly wasted as a genaral ofthe tghe u
. s
. army
, who puts a state ofthe martial law over nyc durring tyhe climax
. whatever points
,
" tyhe sigee
,
" earnestly tryed tothe mkae
, weere obviously lost inaddition thge translation fomr page tothe screen
, or mabye
, zwick never raelly hadnt anytying sereous tothe sday inspite yhe frist palce
. hte role ofthe tjhe arab comunity isnt offensively stereotypical
, jsut as womens weere inthe teh reccent
,
" john caprenter ' s vampires
,
" by placing them all inspite thte categroy ofthe
" bad guys
.
"
" yhe isege
,
" containes threee fine actors
-
-
- washington
, bening
,
anbd shalhoub
-
-
-
bu washington isnt sticked witht a charactor tyhat countains nto an ounce ofthe even remote develepment
. bening hasnt slightly moreso tothe dont
,
adn hasnt an intriguing charater tothe owrk witht
, hwile shalhoub preety much steals tghe sohw
, even
though
, agina
, he hasnt noone rela charactor
. by tyhe climax ofthe
,
" thte isege
,
" wiht washington giving a sergon tothe willis onthe tje so
- called
" message
" ofthe thte stry
, i feeled liek i hadnt wandered inot a sequal tothe
,
" onthe deadly ground
,
" inaddition whlch steven seagal gavey a 10
- minute speach at tje end baout preserving thge enviornment
.
" tjhe sigee
" isnt constanly hevy
- handed
, nto intertaining or insightful
,
annd jsut goes tothe proove thgat nto even thte best actors cin savve a film thta lacks a satisfactory screenplay
.
