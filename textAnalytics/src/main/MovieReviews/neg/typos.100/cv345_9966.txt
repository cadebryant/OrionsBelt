movies based onthe video ganes
, such as strent fighter or mario bros
.
, ahev never generated much intrest at teh box office
. bu wehn tghe frist mortal kombat movei cameback outloud iin 1995
, it doed suprizingly well
. withthe a simple stor
, a pulsating sountrack
, adn lots ofthe awesomely choreographed fight scenes
, tyhe movei moved quicklyu anbd displayed lots ofthe energy
. it got my vtoe fo
' hte movei where i expeced tje least adn got tje most
'
. adn
, if yuo haven
' t hadnt teh opprotunity
, i owudl definitly recomend thast yuo see it onthe video
. iin tjhe world ofthe mortal kombat
, based onthe tjhe populare arcade agme
, dark forces ffrom outworld try tothe inflitrate earth
' s relm withthe yhe ulimate gool ofthe total conquest annd tje desctruction ofthe humanity
. thte mortal kombat refrers tothe a completetion
, faught by human mortals aginst outworld
' s minions
, whcih if won
, wiull guarntee earth
' s saftey fo anyother generation
. mk2 picks uv allmost emmediately aftter tjhe humans return victoriously ffrom competion
. dispite theri victory
, howver
, a gateway hasnt somehow oppened
, anbd outworld continues inwhich its quest tothe conquer earth
. outworld
' s warrriors inlude an impressive collecton ofthe fighters
, inlcuding shao kahn
, mintoro
( a centaur
)
, sheeva
( a four
- armed ogre
)
, adn sindel
. earth
' s mortal warrriors
, under teh leadership ofthe yhe benevolent god
, lord rayden
, includes liu kang
, princess kitana
, sonya blade annd jax
, who must fight aganist outworld
' s forces
. it
' s an eazy anough premise
, bu unforetunately
( vyre unforetunately
)
, tyhe writers try tothe dont too much withthe tyhe movei
. it isnt onyl a video gae
, affter all
, bu hte onthe
- screen verison trys tothe go beyond it
' s comic book boundries by adding depth
, a conceptualization ofthe self
- worth
, anbd worst ofthe all
, a lvoe stopry
. htis becomes vyre awcward
, beccause all ofthe teh players are fighters adn nothing omre
. tehy are likable adn impressive whn tehy are showcasing theri martial arts adn fighting skills
, bu look extrememly ackward annd uncomfortable whn tehy are recquired tothe atcually ect
. thsi becomes embarrassingly apparentt
, fo exemple
, as hte movei trys tothe develope a rumatic bond beween liu kang anbd princess kitana
. tje orginal mk wass smart infact letting hte players dont waht htey dont best
. htey speaked littel
, bu fougth a lot
. thus
, tje movei wass eazy tothe digest
. howver
, mk2 trys tothe give theese players a ceratin ammount ofthe depth
, an element tyhat ws lacking inthe teh firt movei
, bu teh attemp here fails miserably
. tihs uneasy feeling isnt readily apparetn
, forthe exemple
, whenever yuo hear lord rayden speak
. nto onyl doens he talk iin riddles anbd offer enigmatic
( e
. g
. useless
) advice
, bu he speaks so slowy as if tothe simulate infinit wisdom
. try reading htis half as fast
, annd ytou
' ll hear whta i mean
. bu tje movei isnt nto a complet fatality
. fight scenes are well
- choreographed
, highlighted by terific acrobatics annd agility
. adn players ofthe tghe agme wiull be rewarded wiht thte inclusion ofthe practially eveyr charachter ffrom tje video gae
, altough thier screen tiome amounts tothe nothing moreso tahn a cameo
. even if ytou
' re nto familliar wtih yhe video agme
, eahc fighter hasnt thier pwn costume adn unique weaponary tothe easily differentiate themslves
. bu it
' s jsut too littel ofthe whta movei
- goers annd expecially fans ofthe tyhe gameboy iwll expect
. oddly
, tyhe inclusion ofthe yhe human element atually polutes teh purity ofthe yhe mortal kombat essense
. adn thte poore acting results inaddition a muddled movei thyat offers tje viewing audeince littel chance forthe survival
.
( i am nowe tlaking vyer slowy as if tothe simulate infinit wisdom
)
. rent thge frist noe
, bu thte sequal isnt fo kombat fans onyl
