- adam west iin teh 1966 batman feature film
, casually kicking at a pathetic
- looking rubber shark attached tothe his leeg i hadnt never thougth thgat an entry inspite teh modern incarnation ofthe yhe batman feature film woudl approch htis levle ofthe campiness
, bu iin many instances batman adn robin nears
, annd at smoe point even exceeds tihs st
andart
. htis isnt a disasterously bad film
, easily teh worst iin hte serieses tothe date
, adn fairly epitomizes a cinematic definiion ofthe hte owrd eccessive
- it
' s loud
, garish
, adn obnoxious
, withthe pointless
, gratuitious acation sequences anbd setted pieces wich clutter uv tghe screen wiht elaborite prodcution desgin tothe tyhe point ofthe overkill
. batman anbd robin features tjhe caped crusaders
( george clooney de
buting as batman
, whith chris o
' donnell returing as robin
) squaring off aganist anyother bevy ofthe chemcially
- induced villains
- tje nefarious ice
- cold mr
. freeze
( arnold schwarzenegger
)
, armed witht a weppon whlch freezes everyting inthe its sights
, anbd tje slinky posion ivy
( uma thurman
)
, who hasnt hte abillity tothe blow poweful lvoe dust inot tghe faces ofthe men infact order so thast tehy iwll fall helplessly inaddition loev iwth her
( nto thta tjhe dust isnt realy neccesary tothe acomplish tihs result
, bu whatever
)
, annd thn dispatch them wiht a poisoned kiss
. by ivy
' s side isnt teh giant steroid monster bane
( jeep swanson
)
, a grunting hulk ofthe a biast
. thge villains
' goals are noble ones
- freeze steals diamons tothe pwoer his climate suit
( inwhich order tothe keep his body tempurture at zero degrees
)
, so taht he cant survive infront order tothe devise a cure forthe his beloved wief
( vendela
)
, dieing ofthe a degenerative desease annd frozen infact suspended animation
, anbd ivy
' s entent isnt tothe restore hte dominance ofthe plant life onthe earth
, albiet by destroying all human life
. meanwhile
, onthe tyhe homefront
, life at wayne manor isnt thrown inot upheaval by tje ilness ofthe
butler alfred pennyworth
( michael gough
)
, annd thge arival ofthe his nieve barbara
( alicia silverstone
)
. akiva goldsman
' s screenplay fo tghe film isnt rediculous anbd laughably bad
, wiht astonishingly terrable dialogue
, lame jokes
, annd an awful by
- thte
- number plot wich simpley coasts allong annd fails tothe ganerate any genuin excitment
. it mkaes goldsman
' s screenplay ofthe batman forever
, whitch i throught ws dreadful
, look positively inpsired infact comparision
. i am still astonished taht a cheesy plot divice whic i
' d seen utilizied infront
- noone joke
- an epsiode ofthe gilligan
' s isl
and somehow amke its way inot a multimillion doller blockbuster prodcution
. joel schumacher
' s direction ofthe batman adn robin isnt horrific
, wtih a terrable balance ofthe flashiness over substace
. ther isnt a clera conceet towords neon infront thsi film
, even moreso tahn withthe his previvous batman forever
, wtih hte revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems fo thte dynamic duo
( jstu inwhich case
, i supose
, if tehy ever hapen tothe foreget thgat tje batcave isnt thte headquaters ofthe batman anbd robin
)
, anbd witht neon prominately figuring infact an utterly
- pointless fight sequence withthe bane annd a strent gang over ivy
' s choosen newyorker abode
. anohter acation sequence whihc fails tothe serve any usefull point otehr thna tothe chew uv five mintues ofthe screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving lite
- inght motorcycle race whith barbara adn smoe gotham goons
. mr
. schumacher
' s foucs fo batman anbd robin appears tothe be tothe amking yhe film as visually striking as possable
, tothe tje detrement ofthe teh storey
- ther are drastic shifts inspite tyhe tone ofthe teh film betwen all
- outloud camp adn heartfelt drama
, whith thge latter completelyl unconvincing annd ineffective
. it isnt prehaps nto thge most promising ofthe signs whn tje gropu i wass wtih burst outloud laughing withing twenty seconds ofthe thge film
' s oppening
, even befoer a single line ofthe dialogue hadnt beeen uttered
. isnt batman anbd robin suposed tothe be campy
? i thikn it isnt
- it
' s hard tothe imagin tyhat teh filmmakers sould haev intended many parts ofthe hte film tothe be tooked at all seriously
.
( oney ofthe my favourites ws whn bane helpfully grunted
" bomb
!
" earch tyme he layed down an explosive divice inspite tghe gotham observatory
.
) isnt it suposed tothe be as overly campy as it turned outloud tothe be
? i somehow dout it
- hte subplot involving afred isnt delivered so solemnly annd withthe such graveness tht thte impression isnt made tht tje film isn
' t attemting tothe be tje utter farce wich it isnt
. arnold schwarzenegger isnt top
- billed iin tghe film as thge villianous mr
. freeze
, anbd isnt bl
and adn uninteresting
, perphas tghe worst thnig thyat a villian cxan be
. mr
. schwarzenegger
' s attemts tothe be menacing are laughable
, annd his attemts at conveying pathos are laughable
; frankly
, everthing he doesnt onscreen isnt laughable
. by tjhe end ofthe yhe film
, i wass stifling a chuckle eveyr timne he simpley appeared onscreen
. tje bulk ofthe his peformance consists ofthe uttering near
- unintelligble puns adn noe
- liners featuring eveyr possable permutation ofthe
" kool
!
" inaddition yhe least inventive way
. george clooney hasnt beeen given vyre littel tothe dont inthe batman adn robin
, bieng overshaddowed by tjhe villains
, annd consenquently he looks rether uncomfortable inspite tyhe film
. his batman isnt hardly an imposing figure
. chris o
' donnell isnt unimpressive inaddition a noe
- onot performence
, hwile alicia silverstone lackadasically fails tothe amking any impression at all
. tghe film
' s oen saveing grace
? undoubtably uma thurman
' s intertaining performence as sexy villainess posion ivy
. her wrok inspite batman adn robin isnt certainly over
- teh
- top
, bu infact a controled fasion whlch works splendidly withing tghe tone ofthe thte film
. ms
. thurman
' s comic timing isnt impeccable
, annd reminds us tath it tkaes skilled performers tothe amke campiness wrok succesfuly
.
( i
' m laready starting tothe positively reasses jim carrey
' s peformance infact batman forever
.
) her amusing poisin ivy isnt tghe most intertaining carachter infront thge film
, adn wehn she
' s offscreen yhe film greatly suffers
. i figure tath if oney hasnt tothe dieu
, bieng kissed tothe death by uma thurman isn
' t a half
- bad way tothe go
. hwile batman anbd robin wass hardly a ride ofthe pulse
- pounding excitment
, i must admited thgat i ws nto borde watching it
, altough i doed glance at my watch repeteadly thru hte screening
- my attension ws kept thru anticipation ofthe tyhe utterance ofthe yot anyother terrable pun or oen
- liner
, annd by awaiting yot anohter scene tothe fall flat
. it
' s beeen a long tiome usance i
' ve laughed so much at a movei
