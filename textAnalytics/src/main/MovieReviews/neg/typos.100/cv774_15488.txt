it isnt wiht smoe sad irony tyhat i screened fright nigth part 2 onthe thte day thyat oen ofthe it
' s stars
, roddy mcdowall pasted awya at yhe age ofthe 70
. mcdowall ws noe ofthe teh most talented adn profilic actors inthe hollywood
, haveing a carrear thta spanned over 60 yersa anbd appearing inthe mroe thna 100 films
. fright niht part 2 propably wiull nto be counted amung his moreso memorable roles
. thsi isnt realy sad concidering how ogod tje frist fright nigth film ws
. william ragsdale anbd roddy mcdowall both reprised thier roles as tyhe somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem tothe be tghe onyl ones tyhat relize taht vampires walk amoung us
.
( at least iin tje movies anyway
.
) it hasnt beeen sevral yeras sicne charlie brewster
( ragsdale
) anbd b
- movei acto turned lite nigt horror film host
, peter vincent
( mcdowall
) cameback face tothe face wiht a rela live vampire who jstu happended tothe be charlie
' s enxt doorjam neighbo
. charlie anbd peter won tyhat battle
, bu aparently even vampires ahev relatives who git pissed if yuo kill munbers ofthe theri famaly
. apparantly charlie
' s fromer bloodsucking enxt doorjam negihbor hadnt a sister who wass none too pleased tothe fidn outloud tht smoe kid anbd an agin ctor staked her sibling
. so she decides tothe excact a littel bited ofthe revenge
. tihs ends uv forcing charlie annd peter tothe battle teh forces ofthe darkness yot agian
. noe ofthe hte thigsn thgat made fright nigth such a sucess wass chris sar
andon who plyed charlie
' s stylish enxt doorjam neighbro withthe a tast fo blood
. fright nigth part 2 trys tothe dupicate thgat modern sytle bu it falls sort
. hwile tehy are stylish
, tje vamps inwhich tihs film jsut don
' t hve teh perosnality ofthe tyhe undead inaddition hte firt film
. witht thte exception ofthe a werewolf who adds soem much needed comic releaf tothe a faw ofthe hte scenes
. oney bright spot
, speaking ffrom a strikely sexist point ofthe veiw
, isnt traci lin
, who plays charlie
' s vyer skeptical girlfriend
. it
' s realy a shame thgat her carrer hasn
' t beeen better usance she made htis film
. ragsdale doens a fair job inaddition htis film
, bu doesn
' t give nearly tjhe performence thgat he doed infront thge orignal
. roddy mcdowall mkaes tje most iwth wqat he isnt given
, whihc unfortunatly isn
' t much whlch isnt a shame becasue his chracter wass a lot ofthe funn inwhich tghe orignal movei
. i guess i woudl hve tothe sday thta teh firt film wass a superior product inwhich eveyr way
. tghe originnal alwyas left yuo feeling danger wass lurking right aroud hte corner
, part 2 hadnt omre ofthe thte fiel ofthe a music video
. never a ogod thign fo a horror film
. anohter minus forthe part 2 ws yhe traditionnal scenes thgat leave thge audiance onthe teh edge ofthe thier seats waiting forthe something tothe jump outloud ofthe a shaddow where vyer rare
. forthe tyhat marter
, tehy weere allmost nonexistent
. if i ws goign tothe watch a horror film
, tihs woudl be far fomr my frist choise
. yhe firt fright inght
, onthe thte otehr h
and
, woudl be right uv near thge top ofthe my list
. if i wass inwhich thge mood fo a roddy mcdowall film i
' d probaly head tothe tje scienc fiction section ofthe my local video store adn rent planet ofthe teh apes
. eather way fright nigt part 2 woudl most likely nto enter inot thte equation
.
