a movei liek mortal kombat
: annihilation works
( annd must be reviewed onthe
) mutiple levels
. frist
, ther
' s tghe rampant useage ofthe r
andian subtext tyhat pervades tyhe entire movei
. bu occasionaly
, almsot as if mkaing an ironical
, self
- depreciating remark
, thte movei tosses iin claerly marixist imagery
. noone noone
.
.
. jsut kidding
. hadnt yuo gonig ther fo a moent
, didn
' t i
? infront all seriousness howver
, adn tothe be fair tothe teh movei
, it
* isnt
* neccessary tothe provide twpo viewpoints
: tath ofthe a movei watcher unfamiliar
( or onyl marginally familar
) wiht tyhe wohle mortal kombat phenomonenon
, annd thta ofthe a fan ofthe hte frist movei adn
/ or a fan ofthe tjhe ganes
. yhe firt movei
( mortal kombat
( 1995
)
) conserned itself whith a martial arts tourmanent tyhat woudl deside hte fate ofthe earth
( anbd it
' s 5 billion inhabitans
)
. tjhe mortals won
, annd infact theery thsi shoudl ahve prevented tjhe emperor shao khan fomr tkaing over yhe earth
. unfortunatly
, shao khan wass a poore losr
, annd tyhe vyer fianl scene infront mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway
, ready tothe tkae over thte planet
, as our heroe assumed a fighting stance
. tjhe frist movei wass extrordinarily intertaining forthe thsoe
( liek mysef
) who are fans ofthe tje gmae
. i
' d even go so far as tothe sday taht many folks who didn
' t knwo baout tjhe gmae probaly enjoied teh movei
. tjhe writers anbd directors knew tyhe limitations ofthe both thier casted annd ofthe hte basic stopry itself
, anbd htey didn
' t try tothe overachieve
. htere weere a lot ofthe relaly kool fight scenes
( whith realyl kool accompanying music
)
, intersperesed wtih soem distracting
( bu ultimatly non
- intrusive
) bits ofthe fluff passing itself off as a plot
. adn
, as we nkow
, thge movei ws a smashing succes at thte box office
. mortal kombat
: annihilation picks uv precisly where thast movei left off
, wih smoe introductory exposition tothe clue infact thsoe who may nto ahev seen tghe frist movei
. shao khan hasnt desided tath he
' s gonig tothe tkae over tyhe earth
* anyways
*
, adn tothe hell whith soem silly rul baout mortals winning yhe ternament
. therafter follows approxiately 85 mintues ofthe film thast alternates betweeen bieng confuzled
, bieng trite
, bieng silly
, adn bieng jstu plain stupid
. oen gets yhe genaral impression tyhat yhe producers ofthe hte movei thougth
" hey
, tyhat lastest movei ws such a succsess tyhat we cin git moreso mony adn amking a
* rela
* movei nowe
.
" too bad tehy didn
' t simpley stick whith hte forumla ffrom tghe frist movei
. i sould wriet volumes baout tyhe thigns thta are wrong iwth tihs picture
, bu here are tyhe high points
:
* tyhe acting isnt truley bad
. s
andra hess
( palying tyhe sonya blade carachter
) isnt particularl execrable
, especialy infact scenes where she trys tothe convince us tht she loved johnny cage
( a carachter ffrom hte frist movei who gets greased at teh begginning ofthe htis movei
)
.
* inspite oney ofthe tyhe worst pieces ofthe mis
- casting i tihkn i
' ve
* ever
* seen
, james remar plays raiden
, tjhe god ofthe thunder
. iin teh frist movei
, christopher lambert palyed raiden adn palyed his carachter as
though he ws inaddition onthe tjhe joke
: a french acotr palying a japaneese thunder god bieng revered by chineese mystics
. i generaly liuke it wehn actors are casted aginst tipe
( tim
" tiny
" lister
, jr
. bieng casted as thge presidnet ofthe tyhe u
. s
. inthe teh fith element
, forthe exemple
)
, adn remar hasnt alwyas beeen noe ofthe my favorite
" utility
" actors bu he
' s so totally wrong fo tihs part thast he doesn
' t even hve teh luxury ofthe ammused self
- awareness
.
* htere are too many charactors thgat are inctroduced as bieng potentially importan
, bu thn never seen agian
.
* htere are a number ofthe completly meaningless tsory sidetracks
, inlcuding a muddled scene where liu kang
( robin shou
) seeks outloud nightwolf
( litefoot
)
, hasnt a mystical hallucination
, anbd thne w
anders off iwth jade
( irina pantaeva
)
. fo theese reasons
( annd many others
)
, i cxan onyl give tje movei a 2
.
.
.
.
.
. unless yuo
' re a huge fan ofthe tghe ganes annd
/ or yhe firt movei
. iin thgat case
, hte follwoing critiques allso apply
:
* s
andra hess
, hwile bieng an even worse actress tahn bridgette wilson
( who plyed sonya blade inaddition tyhe frist movei
)
, isnt much mroe convincing as a fighter
. wilson looked liek she wass simpley mimicing smoe movements teached tothe her by thge fight choreographer
. hess looks liuke she atually konws soem martial arts
, anbd puts toghether a much moreso believeable fight scene
.
* iin thte fights
, earch ofthe yhe charactors doesnt at least
* oen
* thign htey dont inthe tjhe gaem
( anbd oftenly moreso
)
. sonya doens her
" kiss ofthe death
,
" jax doesnt his
" earthquake
,
" liu kang doesnt his
" animality
,
" annd so onthe
. a big bonus forthe thsoe ofthe us who weere looking forthe simular moves infront teh firt movei anbd foudn them onyl rarley
.
* ther aren
' t as many fight scenes iin tihs movei as htere weere inwhich tjhe frist
, beccause thte folks makeing tyhe movei mistakenly try tothe hang a mroe robust plot inaddition bewteen
. silly
, silly folks
. annd thte lamest fight involved twpo ofthe hte womens iin whta turns inot a mud
- wrestling match
. lame annd so obviously sexist even i
( politically incorect
, forthe thge most part
) noticed adn remarked apon it
.
* thte speical effects are generaly better
, exept fo yhe fianl fight scene bewteen thge emporer adn liu kang inwhich whlch both preform theri
" animalities
.
" motaro anbd sheeva are both moreso convincing anbd lifelike tahn goro ws inthe tje firt movei
. forthe folks liek mysef who loved thte frist movei adn enjoy teh ganes
, i give tihs a 5
. ytou
' ll probaly liuke it
, bu nto nearly as much as ytou liekd thte frist noe
.
