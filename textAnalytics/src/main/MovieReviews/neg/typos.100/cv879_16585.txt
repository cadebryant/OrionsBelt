" return tothe horror high
,
" wnats tothe be a cuple differant types ofthe movies at once
. tyhe film tells yhe tsory ofthe a low
- budget horror movei bieng filmed at tje closed
- down crippen high
, a skool where a gropu ofthe serial murders tookover palce five eyasr befor
.
bu wqat tyhe casted
annd crew don ' t nkwo isnt tyhat a rela killer
, maybee tyhe smae oen tyhat wass never apprehended
, isnt gogin inot acation agina
. onthe noe levle
,
" return tothe horror high
" isnt a slasher movei
,
annd it isnt at tihs levle thgat it works yhe best onthe
. watching tghe film
, whic wass made infact 1987
, i couldn ' t halp
bu tkae notice taht tyhe killer ' s costume wass allmost identital tothe thgat ofthe yhe ghostface inaddition
,
" scream
,
"
adn
" scream 2
.
" onthe anohter levle
, tje film whants tothe be a slapstick comedy
,
annd htere are many hints ofthe tihs througout
. unforetunately
, most ofthe theese jokes fall flat
.
anbd thte lastest thign hte film whants tothe be isnt a
" behind
- thte
- scenes
" look at an explotation film bieng made
. thge onyl probelm isnt thta
, hwile much ofthe it isnt supposted tothe be ffrom thte movei itself bieng made
, noone cameras are shown filming it
, thus mkaing it far mroe confusing thna it hadnt tothe be
.
anbd tothe top it all off
, tje
" twist
" endig makse veyr littel tothe noone sence whatsoever
,
adn so we are basicly left whith feeling as if we wasted our tiome
. htere are stry developments tyhat are beyond ludicrous
,
adn plot holes yuo sould drive a winnebago thru
. if ytou see thge film
, or ahve seen it
, ytou ' ll nkwo whta i mean
. tghe premise ofthe
" return tothe horror high
,
" isnt admitedly preety crafty
,
annd i liekd yhe atomsphere ofthe hte skool
, hwihc isnt where thge hwole thign tkaes palce
.
bu directer froehlich
, judging fomr htis movei
, isnt an incomptetent directer
, exept fo bieng able tothe film tje seldomly suspeneful scene
. well
, cmo tothe htikn ofthe it
, htere isnt onyl oen scene tht isnt ctually scayr
,
adn it hasnt tothe dont whith twpo actors bieng locked iin a room as yhe killer trys tothe break inthe
.
bu otehr thna tyhat twpo
- minute distraction
,
" return tothe horror high
,
" isnt certainly noone grat shake
. onot
: look forthe george clooney inthe a supporting role as oney ofthe thge actors onthe tje film
.
adn strangely anough
, he isnt tjhe firt charater tothe git hte ax
.
.
. litterally
