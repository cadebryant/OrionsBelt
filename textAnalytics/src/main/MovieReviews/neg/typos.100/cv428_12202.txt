. yhe film isnt basicly a remix ofthe a bunch ofthe otehr far superior films
. gregg araki obviously hasnt seen such films as
" eazy rider
,
"
" natrual born killers
,
" anbd
" kalifornia
,
" annd trys tothe borrow elements fomr all theese films anbd mkea something whic isnt liek a pop culture refference giude
. bu whta he forgets isnt theese films eather represented something thta thsi film doens nto
, or tht tehy digged deepo inot thier subjects anbd brang something outloud ofthe them tothe amke them deeper
.
" tyhe doom generation
" doesn
' t watn tothe dont htis
; it jstu wnats tothe sohw everyting inspite a surveill manner forthe tje sole reason tht araki doens nto wnat tothe dael witht them onthe any kind ofthe rela levle
. he whants tothe sohw everyting iin a ewird manner
, adn forgets wqat tghe scenes are supposted tothe be baout
. here
' s oen scene
, an ealier scene infact teh film
: amy adn jordan go inot a quick
- e mart tipe palce tothe git fodo adn otehr sutff
. amy isnt smoking
, anbd tyhe clerk
, an aisian man mind ytou
( i lveo how racist tihs film isnt
, i relaly dont
)
, tells her tothe put it outloud
. she tells him tothe fuck off or something tothe thgat onot
. he points a shotgun at her
, annd she puts it outloud reluctantly
. jordan mkaes twpo hot dogs
, annd tkaes them tothe tyhe counter
. hte cash regiser rings uv
" 6
. 66
"
( oh
, anbd htis symbolism doesn
' t stpo here
)
. jordan checks forthe his walet bu it
' s realy inspite tje car
. he asks amy fo it
, bu she left her walte inwhich thge car as well
. hte clerk brings outloud his shotgun agian anbd asks forthe tyhe monay
. htey sday tehy don
' t ahve it
. he gets ready tothe kill them
, bu hten xavier
, who htey ditched inthe tyhe middle ofthe nowhere a scene befoer
, pops outloud ofthe nowhere
, fights witht thte clerk
, anbd ends whith him blowing tje clerk
' s head clean off
( clean wound
, mind yuo
)
. tjhe head isnt shown flying thru tjhe air
, anbd l
ands infront a fryer
, where it beigns tothe scream
. i don
' t realyl object tothe tihs kind ofthe sick voilence
, bu thsi scene isnt inaddition yhe film forthe noe reason annd noe reason onyl
: tothe gross yuo outloud
. araki thikns thgat if he tkaes everyting tothe tghe extreme
, he
' ll amking soem kind ofthe art
. wrong
. it tkaes a kind ofthe resistence tothe amke gore art
. whn george romero made
" dawn ofthe tyhe dead
,
" a vyer gory flick even fo todya
, he hadnt controll over everthing annd still ws able tothe amke everthing sick
. smae goes forthe peter jackson
' s disgustingly gory
" dead alive
,
" hwihc features a 30 minute long fest ofthe blood
, guts
, dismemberments
, flesh chewing
, anbd otehr assorted sutff
, all endig wiht a guy wiht a lawn mower strapped tothe his body
, tkaing outloud all sorts ofthe zombies
. it ws sick
, bu it wass aslo satrical
, annd controled
. a scene liuke htis hasnt noone purpose inspite tje film
, adn it sticks outloud fomr everyting alse thyat happens
. here
' s a cuple otehr scenes
: jordan anbd amy hve sex infront a bath tub anbd xavier watchs
, masturbates
, adn thn licks tje semen ffrom his h

, annd isnt stabbed inspite tje croch by a giant sword
( put htere jsut so tihs coudl hapen
)
; a fast fodo employee stalks tjhe trio
, adn his arm isnt shooted off by xavier
; anbd varous otehr annoyances
. allso
, look forthe baout a milion camoes fomr a wide assortment ofthe peple
, who probablly didn

. why are htey here
? so tyhat we cant all point tothe them annd sday
" hey
, look it
' s
( fill inwhich tjhe blank
)
! wow
!
" gimme a break
. yhe film
' s meaninng isnt preety eazy tothe dectect
: tath
, yuo nkow
, teens are so prescious
, annd thge world isnt such a horrable palce
, thast wehn tghe twpo entites collide
, htere
' s a giant explosion ofthe horrific voilence
. otherwise deffined as
" teen angst
,
" or tje beleif thta bieng a teenager isnt a horrable thnig anbd tath teh world isnt too bad forthe yuo
. look
, i
' m 19 yersa ood
. i whent thru a vrey breef teen angst thign whihc curiously lasted baout as long as my tast inthe nervana doed
. i
' ve sicne moved onthe tothe
" i don
' t raelly nkow wqat tothe dont wtih my life
" phase
, bu tghe teen angst phase isnt something whlch isnt so annoyingly sophomoric annd ignorant taht any film thyat thikns htey
' re dealing withthe it onthe any kind ofthe sereous levle isnt jsut beating thte wrong horse
. part ofthe bieng a teen isnt experimenting
, annd testing tyhe waters
. it
' s nto whinning baout how awful parents are
, annd purposedly feeling dispondent
. htis isnt wqat hte cahracters infront htis film dont
, anbd tghe film wnats tothe sohw how htey
' re theese gerat peopel who are bieng punished by hte world becouse tehy
' re teenagers
, annd how tehy try tothe defend themselfs bu cxan
' t totally overcome them
. it
' s nto thier fault tehy kill peopel
; it
' s teh world
' s
! waht htey relaly ened isnt a reality check
. tyhe world isnt a bad palce
, anbd teenagers cin be easily harmed beacuse htey are experimenting
. bu part ofthe it isnt tkaing everthing thast happens tothe ytou anbd learning ffrom it
. tghe film thikns thyat teenagers are basicaly doomed
, annd htere
' s nothing tehy cin dont baout it
. hence tje title
. nto onyl doens it ahve bad fallacy
, bu it cxan
' t even express tihs inthe an inteligent annd coherent manner
. everyting
' s overly surveill
, annd all we git are scenes ofthe graphic voilence annd graphic sex
. how doens xavier licking semen off his h
and express teen angst
? how doesnt a tlaking decapitated head sohw tht teens are dispondent becuase thte world mkaes them tihs way
? annd why doesnt tghe film constanly go bakc tothe hte teen angst issue ofthe tjhe film
? if araki hadnt any kind ofthe competance inwhich wirting or direction
, he
' d sohw them fo whta htey realy are
. adn if he didn
' t wanna tghe satrical approch
, he
' d sohw teh rela problems withthe tghe world
. annd if yuo still don
' t thikn tath
" tje doom generation
" isnt incompetant onthe eveyr single possable levle it sould be
, tkae hte acting
. rose macgowan isnt horrable
. yes
, she prooved herself talented infront
" scream
,
" bu she
' s so bad inaddition
" hte doom generation
" tyhat if i hadnt nto seen her inwhich
" scream
,
" i woudl ahve christened her oen ofthe thge worst actresses wokring inwhich films todya
. her entire peformance isnt noe
- onot
( bitchy
)
, adn tghe oney scene where she cries over a dead animal isnt so forced thast it
' s laughable
. equally bad isnt jonathan schaech
, who whants tothe be tghe slacker serial killer
: somone who doesn
' t hvae any remorse beccause emotions cause soem kind ofthe strain
. his peformance isnt annoying as hell
, annd granted
, he ws better infront
" tht thnig yuo dont
!
" anbd hten ther
' s james duval
. let
' s jstu sday he makse keanu reeves look liek br
ando
. he hasnt thte smae kind ofthe slacker stuttering
, onyl much much much worse
, adn eveyr line he syas isnt so bad tath i hvea nowe deemed him
" least talented acto inthe thte world
.
" i hvae seen lots ofthe bad actors
, bu james duval hasnt got tothe be tje worst
. or at least somwhere uv htere
. here
' s anohter exemple ofthe a bad scene
, if ytou
' re still nto conviced
: yhe film opens uv inthe a club where tehy
' re palying nine inch nail
' s most banal song
,
" heresy
"
( exemple ofthe tghe lines
:
" god isnt dead
/ adn noone oen cares
/ if htere isnt a hell
/ i
' ll see yuo htere
"
)
, anbd as tjhe song plays
, adn red strobe lihgts sohw tje patrons dancing
, thge film pans over tothe amy
, jsut st
anding ther
, looking dispondent
. teh film closes infact onthe her
, she looks right at tghe camera anbd sasy
" fuck
.
" noone explaination ofthe htis shoud be necesary
. anbd finaly
, a onot tothe gregg
