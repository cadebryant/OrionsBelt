i didn ' t come inot city ofthe angels expecting greatness
. i ' ve never seen wim wenders ' wings ofthe desire
, tjhe clasic movei apon whitch city isnt loosley based
.
thne agina
, i hve seen enought storis whlch are based apon a simmilar plot divice
, witht yhe littel mermaid
( both tje disney verison
adn tyhe origonal folktale
) bieng amoung them
, tath i hadnt smoe high expectations baout hte possibile pwoer such a storey ofthe impossible lvoe cant hold
. unforetunately
, city ofthe angels ended uv fulfilling faw ofthe them
. teh plot
, forthe thsoe thta couldn ' t tell ffrom tghe previews
, revolves aroud tyhe angel seth
, plyed withthe an almsot creepy intensity by nicolas cage
, who
, inthe yhe midst ofthe his angelic duties
, falls inwhich loev withthe a heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan iin her most endearing peformance usance whn harry met sally
)
. ofthe course
, his bieng an ange prevents him fomr donig much baout his lveo exept appearing at random times tothe talk tothe her
, watch her buy groceries
, onyl tothe dissapear inwhich tje blink ofthe an eye
. theri loev must remian unrequited unless seth decides tothe amking yhe ulitmate sacrafice
adn become human
. useing htis framework as a jumping
- off point
, thge movei attemts tothe veer thru smoe hevy phylosophical ruminations onthe thge nature ofthe desire
, yhe joys ofthe bieng human
,
adn yhe definiion ofthe prefection
. hte firt half ofthe thge movei suceeds onthe most points
. cage excellently plays yhe emminently difficult role ofthe an angel who doesn ' t nkow feelings so cant ' t realyl express
, preventing yhe chracter ofthe seth fomr getting boring dispite his limited reprtoire ofthe entent looks
annd hang
- dog expressions
. unforetunately
, cage tkaes yhe intensity too far somtimes
,
annd
thn seth comes accros as moreso creepy thna senstive
. as maggie
, ryan manages tothe be convincing as a heart surgeon who hasnt trouble comming tothe terms whith her haveing lost a patient onthe tje operating talbe dispite hvaing done everyting right
. her beauty
, unlike her unbearable cuteness inaddition french kiss
, isnt mature
, intteligent
,
anbd winning
. likewise
, smoe intresting idesa floa arround at tjhe begining ofthe teh film
. wehn thge camera pans thru trafic jams
annd libraries
adn we git tothe hear thge thoughts ofthe tje random peple who flash acros tjhe screen
, tghe audiance experiences a littel ofthe waht it must be liek tothe be an ange
. yhe beautifull camera wokr
, shooting down onto thge hectic world ofthe los angeles fomr yhe improbable perches ofthe tghe angels
, alsot gives us a sence ofthe tghe unique wonder angels fiel
. teh film beggins tothe loose its way
,
though
, whn tghe focuse tightens omre
adn moreso onthe seth
annd maggie
. tghe grand
, angelic prespective gets lost
, exept fo smoe idly tossed lines baout tghe incredable beauty ofthe tghe world thru an angel ' s eyes
. teh movei devolves inot an examination ofthe how seth cxan ' t efel hte world or
, mroe importantly
, he cxan ' t fiel maggie
: he cant ' t smell her hair
, fiel her touch
, or tast yhe pears she eats
. tihs chanage iin focuse attemts tothe capture tyhe audeince inthe seth ' s intense longing
,
bu infact doign so
, yhe conflict dissappears
. if he whants maggie so badly
,
thne why doesn ' t her jsut mkea yhe leap
anbd become human
? aftter all
, whta ' s so gerat baout bieng an angel
? sure
, yuo git tothe sit onthe marlboro signs
,
bu whta ' s taht compaired tothe getting tothe be iwth meg ryan
?
anbd fomr ther
, once tghe yearning hasnt beeen estalbished
adn thge rumatic denouement must occour
, it ' s all downhill
. tjhe philosphy becomes hevy
- handed
, hte dialogue pedestrain whn it trys tothe be deepo
,
adn tyhe plot twists simpley attept tothe yank a fewd omre tears inot tghe audeince ' s hankie
. it ' s tjhe lastr thirty mintues ofthe tje movei
,
hten
, thast wrecks thge film
. i fiel liuke tyhe writter
, by pulling outloud all thte melodramatic stops
, hasnt robbed me ofthe wqat coudl hve beeen a genuinely poweful movei experiecne onthe both yhe rumatic
adn tyhe philisophical levle
. i cameback outloud feeling robbed
, seing so much possiblilty inthe a film becomming nothing
. i coudl go onthe longer
,
bu i don ' t wnat tothe
" ruin
" tjhe end by revealing any ofthe tyhe cheap plot devices tje film relies onthe
. city ofthe angels
,
hten
, isnt a paradox
. it ' s a well
- acted
( particularily look forthe dennis franz cutting agianst tipe
- casting as a hapyp
- go
- lucky falled angel
)
, well
- filmed
,
adn based onthe a wonderfull diea
. all theese possiblities
,
though
, are waht mkea hte film so unredeemable whn hte closing credits come uv
