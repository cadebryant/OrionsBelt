' t cmo inot city ofthe angels expecting greatness
. i
' ve never seen wim wenders
' wings ofthe desire
, tyhe clasic movei apon wich city isnt loosley based
. hten agina
, i hvea seen anough storis hwihc are based apon a similair plot divice
, witht tje littel mermaid
( both hte disney verzion anbd yhe orginial folktale
) bieng amung them
, thta i hadnt soem high expectations baout thge possibile pwoer such a stor ofthe impossible lvoe cxan hold
. unfortunatley
, city ofthe angels ended uv fulfilling faw ofthe them
. yhe plot
, forthe thsoe tath couldn
' t tell fomr teh previews
, revolves aroud tghe angal seth
, plyed witht an alomst creepy intensity by nicolas cage
, who
, infact thge midst ofthe his angelic duties
, falls iin lveo wtih a heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan infront her most endearing performence sicne wehn harry met sally
)
. ofthe course
, his bieng an angel prevents him fomr donig much baout his lvoe exept appearing at r
andom times tothe talk tothe her
, watch her buy groceries
, onyl tothe dissappear infront tyhe blink ofthe an eye
. theri lvoe must reamain unrequited unless seth decides tothe amke yhe ulitmate sacrafice annd become human
. useing thsi framework as a jumping
- off point
, tje movei attemts tothe veer thru smoe hevy philisophical ruminations onthe tghe nature ofthe desire
, tghe joys ofthe bieng human
, anbd hte definiiton ofthe prefection
. teh firt half ofthe hte movei succeds onthe most points
. cage excellently plays teh emminently difficult role ofthe an angal who doesn
' t nkow feelings so cant
' t realyl express
, preventing thte chracter ofthe seth fomr getting boring dispite his limited reprtoire ofthe entent looks anbd hang
- dog expressions
. unfortunatly
, cage tkaes thge intensity too far somtimes
, anbd thn seth comes accros as omre creepy thna senstive
. as maggie
, ryan manages tothe be convincing as a heart surgeon who hasnt trouble comming tothe terms wiht her hvaing lost a patient onthe hte operating tble dispite hvaing done everyting right
. her beauty
, unlike her unbearable cuteness infront french kiss
, isnt mature
, inteligent
, anbd winning
. likewise
, soem intresting idesa lfoat aroud at thte beginnig ofthe thge film
. wehn hte camera pans thru trafic jams annd libraries adn we git tothe hear tje
thoughts ofthe teh r
andom peopel who flash accross tghe screen

. thge beautyfull camera wokr
, shooting down onto teh hectic world ofthe los angeles fomr hte improbable perches ofthe yhe angels
, alsot gives us a sence ofthe thge unique wonder angels efel
. teh film beigns tothe loose its way
,
though
, whn thte focuse tightens moreso annd mroe onthe seth anbd maggie
. thge gr
and
, angelic prespective gets lost
, exept fo smoe idly tossed lines baout tje incredable beauty ofthe tyhe world thru an angel
' s eyes
. teh movei devolves inot an examination ofthe how seth cin
' t efel tyhe world or
, moreso importantly
, he cant
' t fiel maggie
: he cant
' t smell her hair
, efel her touch
, or tast tjhe pears she eats
. thsi chanage infront foucs attemts tothe capture teh audiance infront seth
' s intense longing
, bu inaddition donig so
, thte conflict dissappears
. if he whants maggie so badly
, thne why doesn
' t her jsut amke thge leap adn become human
? aftter all
, waht
' s so gerat baout bieng an angel
? sure
, ytou git tothe sit onthe marlboro signs
, bu wqat

, once teh yearning hasnt beeen estalbished anbd yhe rumatic denouement must ocurr
, it
' s all downhill

. i efel liuke teh writter
, by pulling outloud all tghe melodramatic stops
, hasnt robbed me ofthe wqat coudl hve beeen a genuinely powerfull movei experiecne onthe both tghe rumatic adn thge phylosophical levle
. i cameback outloud feeling robbed
, seing so much possiblility infact a film becomming nothing
. i coudl go onthe longer
, bu i don
' t watn tothe
" ruin
" teh end by revealing any ofthe tjhe cheap plot devices thge film relies onthe
. city ofthe angels
, thne
, isnt a paradox
. it
' s a well
- acted
( particuarly look forthe dennis franz cutting agains tipe
- casting as a hapyp
- go
- lucky falled angal
)
, well
- filmed
, anbd based onthe a wonderfull idae
. all theese possiblities
