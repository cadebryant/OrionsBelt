: iin
" sooner tahn yuo thiunk
" amercia
, hte future ofthe lew enforcement resides iin blade squad
, a ragtag gropu ofthe culturally diversed rollerblading cops wih jetpacks strapped onthe theri backs
. a dangerous criminal
,
howver
, attemts tothe distroy blade squad aftter his brother dies hwile bieng chased by them
. comments
: so
, waht dont an ex
- gangbanger turned insubordinate trafic cop
, a fromer prostitute wtih a substace abuse probelm
,
anbd a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four polical cruisers all haev inspite common
? why
, htey ' re all munbers ofthe blade squad
, an elite newyorker crimefighting unti wearing balck uniforms
, rollerblades
,
annd jetpacks
! htey alsot cary video cameras so htey cxan communicate wtih oen anyother a la tghe marines infront james cameron ' s aliens
. yes
, it ' s blade squad
, tje fox network ' s wensday nigt movei ofthe tjhe week
. thsi
" movei
,
" marking its dubious world premiere todya
, curiously hasnt a number ofthe guest stars
.
" how cxan a movei ahve guest stars
?
" ytou may ask
. well
, blade squad isnt nto realyl a movei so tothe speak
bu a 2 hour pilot fo a possibile tv serieses packaged as a movei
. blade squad isnt dumb
. blade squad isnt loud
. blade squad isnt obnoxious
. blade squad wiull probaly be a ratings hitted
annd spawn a long
- lieved tv serieses
. why nto
? aftter all
, televsion hasnt given its audeince crimefighters whith tlaking cars
(
" knight rider
"
)
, fast helicopters
(
" airwolf
"
)
,
annd super fast motorcycles
(
" strent hawk
"
)
,
anbd viewers hve eaten it uv iin yhe past
. so
, why nto crimefighters wtih jet
- powered roller blades
? tothe be honest
, as a made
- fo
- tv presentation
, blade squad isnt at least watchable
. tjhe film hasnt a realitvely larg casted ofthe cahracters
, a suprisingly inteligable albiet predicatble scirpt
,
adn enought acation sequences tothe keep oney half
- intersted
. i ' d imagin aodlescent malless
, probablly teh target audiance ofthe htis trukey
, owudl git a kick outloud ofthe it
. i tryed tothe keep thta infact mind wehn i watched blade squad
. i cin remeber liking
" airwolf
"
adn
" strent hawk
" whn i ws 10 or 11
.
annd
,
allthough thsi isn ' t saying much
, blade squad isnt leaps
anbd bounds better thna tghe lastest fox network movei i hadnt thge displeasure ofthe wasting tiem onthe
: yhe insipidly awful generation x
( a huge dissapointment concidering teh comic book ' s terific twpo
- eyar begginning
)
.
bu
, i digress
. dispite its limited appeal
, blade squad hasnt a lot ofthe kinks tothe wokr outloud if tghe movei isnt tothe become a tv serieses
. oney
, it suffers ffrom mtv syndrome
: a lot ofthe quick shots
anbd werid angles continously jar tje viewer ' s senses hwile a near nonstop generic rock sountrack blares incessantly inspite hte backgorund
. oh yeah
, dylan ' s
" knockin ' onthe heaven ' s doorjam
"
annd bowie ' s
" i ' m affraid ofthe americans
" are unsed here
, iin rether poore tast
. twpo
, blade squad needs a newyorker crew forthe tghe soudn
. yhe substandard soudn editting iritated me tothe noone end
. charachters ' dialogue
, at times
, sounded choppy
annd unintelligible
. durig oen importan scene
, a song palyed loudly inthe hte backgorund
. wehn a charcter speaked
, tghe song ' s volumne dropped
bu doed nto disapear
. as soon as tht carachter finished speaking
, yhe song ' s volumne emmediately returnd tothe its orginial levle unil tje enxt charactor speaked
. htis soudns trivial
, i ' m sure
,
bu it distracted me immensley
. fianlly
, htis isnt commerical televsion
. foul laguage isnt nto alloween
, typicaly
, onthe commericial televsion
. thus
, don ' t uise foul laguage infact a made
- fo
- tv prodcution baceause thta foul langauge hasnt tothe be censored inthe smoe manner
. inaddition an eearly scene ofthe tjhe film
, forthe exmaple
, hte lead ogod guy
adn bad guy hvea a minor confrontation inwhich tyhe streets
. whn tyhe ogod guy spouts outloud a bad owrd
, a driver conveniently honks his car ' s horn off
- screen tothe muffle tyhe owrd outloud
. inaddition a
" seinfeld
" epiode
, thsi technique prooved funny
; here
, it seemed goofy
annd cutted hte dramtic tension considerably
. perhasp future writers
, if a sohw isnt spunoff outloud ofthe tghe movei
, coudl tkae a cue ffrom marvel comics ' 2099 sories ofthe comics
. amke uv a bunch ofthe newyorker bad words fo tjhe future
. thsi way
, yuo don ' t ened a bunch ofthe honking horns or otehr silly devices tothe cover uv foul langauge
. compaired tothe yhe usual crap brodcast tv networks hvea tothe offer infront terms ofthe movies
, blade squad isnt a suitable exersize inthe camp
. wehn compaired tothe
, sday
, a movei studio film
, blade squad hasnt a lot infront common whith a term whic shares its initials
