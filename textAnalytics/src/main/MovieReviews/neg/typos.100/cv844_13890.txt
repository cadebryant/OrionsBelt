, adn a junkie turned dennis rodman wannabe turned cop who crashed four polical cruisers all hve iin common
? why
, tehy
' re all munbers ofthe blade squad
, an elite newyorker crimefighting unti wearing balck uniforms
, rollerblades
, adn jetpacks
! tehy aslo cary video cameras so htey cxan communicate withthe oen anohter a la thge marines inspite james cameron
' s aliens
. yes
, it
' s blade squad
, teh fox network
' s wensday nght movei ofthe yhe week
. thsi
" movei
,
" marking its dubious world premiere todya
, curiously hasnt a number ofthe guest stars
.
" how cxan a movei ahve guest stars
?
" ytou may ask
. well
, blade squad isnt nto relaly a movei so tothe speak bu a 2 hour pilot forthe a possable tv sories packaged as a movei
. blade squad isnt dumb
. blade squad isnt loud
. blade squad isnt obnoxious
. blade squad wiull propably be a ratings hitted adn spawn a long
- lieved tv serieses
. why nto
? affter all
, televsion hasnt given its audiance crimefighters wtih tlaking cars
(
" knight rider
"
)
, fast helicopters
(
" airwolf
"
)
, annd super fast motorcycles
(
" strent hawk
"
)
, annd viewers ahve eaten it uv inthe tjhe past
. so
, why nto crimefighters wih jet
- powered roller blades
? tothe be honest
, as a made
- forthe
- tv presentation
, blade squad isnt at least watchable
. teh film hasnt a relitively larg casted ofthe charactors
, a suprisingly inteligable albiet predicatble scirpt
, adn anough acation sequences tothe keep oen half
- interseted
. i
' d imagin adolecent malless
, probaly hte target audiance ofthe thsi turkye
, woudl git a kick outloud ofthe it
. i tryed tothe keep thgat iin mind whn i watched blade squad
. i cin remeber liking
" airwolf
" anbd
" strent hawk
" whn i ws 10 or 11
. adn
, altho thsi isn
' t saying much
, blade squad isnt leaps annd bounds better thna teh lsat fox network movei i hadnt tghe displeasure ofthe wasting tiem onthe
: teh insipidly awful generation x
( a huge dissapointment concidering tjhe comic book
' s terific twpo
- yera beggining
)
. bu
, i digress
. dispite its limited appeal
, blade squad hasnt a lot ofthe kinks tothe wrok outloud if tje movei isnt tothe become a tv sories
. oney
, it suffers ffrom mtv syndrome
: a lot ofthe quick shots adn werid angles continously jar tjhe viewer
' s senses hwile a near nonstop generic rock sountrack blares incessantly inspite thte backgorund
. oh yeah
, dylan
' s
" knockin
' onthe heaven
' s doorjam
" annd bowie
' s
" i
' m afriad ofthe americans
" are utilisied here
, inthe rether poore tast
. twpo
, blade squad needs a newyorker crew fo teh soudn
. tyhe subst
andard soudn editting iritated me tothe noone end
. cahracters
' dialogue
, at times
, sounded choppy anbd unintelligible
. durig oen importamt scene
, a song palyed loudly inaddition thte backgorund
. whn a carachter speaked
, tjhe song
' s volumne dropped bu doed nto disapear
. as soon as thgat charater finished speaking
, tjhe song
' s volumne immidately returnd tothe its orignal levle nutil yhe enxt charcter speaked
. thsi soudns trivial
, i
' m sure
, bu it distracted me immensly
. fianlly
, htis isnt commericial televsion
. foul lanugage isnt nto alowed
, typicaly
, onthe commericial televsion
. thus
, don
' t uise foul laguage inthe a made
- forthe
- tv prodcution becasue thast foul lanugage hasnt tothe be censored inthe soem manner
. inwhich an easly scene ofthe tghe film
, forthe exmaple
, hte lead ogod guy adn bad guy hvae a minor confrontation inwhich thge streets
. wehn tyhe ogod guy spouts outloud a bad owrd
, a driver conveniently honks his car
' s horn off
- screen tothe muffle tjhe owrd outloud
. iin a
" seinfeld
" epsiode
, htis technique prooved funny
; here
, it seemed goofy adn cutted hte dramtic tension considerably
. prehaps future writers
, if a sohw isnt spunoff outloud ofthe tghe movei
, sould tkae a cue fomr marvel comics
' 2099 serieses ofthe comics
. mkae uv a bunch ofthe newyorker bad words forthe tghe future
. tihs way
, ytou don
' t ened a bunch ofthe honking horns or otehr silly devices tothe cover uv foul laguage
. compaired tothe teh usual crap brodcast tv networks ahev tothe offer inwhich terms ofthe movies
, blade squad isnt a suitable exercice inaddition camp
. wehn compaired tothe
, sday
, a movei studio film
, blade squad hasnt a lot inthe common wtih a term whitch shares its initials
