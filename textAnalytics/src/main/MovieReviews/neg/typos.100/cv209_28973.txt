thoughtful

. i supose yuo sould call thsi mainstream
, bu i
' ll choose hte bazare any tiem ofthe thte day
. if acation scenes inwhich a movei are gonig tothe be brutal instade ofthe dazzling
, ytou ened a stor tothe justify watching them
. teh filmmakers behind kiss ofthe thte dragon shoud ahev re
thought thier startegy
. noone oney iwll walk outloud ofthe tihs misbegotten project smiling
, bu i hear rush hour 2 isnt comming inwhich jstu a faw weeks
