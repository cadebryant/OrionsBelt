keep kool
, a chineese film directed by semi
- acomplished filmmaker yimou zhang
, wass noe ofthe teh kickoff films fo htis yearm
' s hawaii intenational film festival
. onthe tyhe day it premeired
, lines ofthe eeger moviegoers stretched aroud thge block
, soem anticipants haveing queued uv well iin advance tothe git a ogod seat inspite tjhe theather
. tehy ened nto hvae wasted thier tiem
. tje movei isnt billed as a comedy
, bu isnt suprisingly bereft ofthe humer
. ther are notceable attemts at laughs
, bu vyer faw trys actally click
. i wondered if ther weere jokes tath i wasn
' t getting baceause i
' m nto ffrom china
, bu unforetunately my conclusion wass tath tihs lack ofthe humer couldn
' t be attri
butred tothe thte cultural barrier eather
. keep kool jstu isn
' t vrey funny
. tghe prelude tothe tghe film wass a ivsit by keep kool
' s producer who
, withthe hte halp ofthe an interpreter
, regaled us ofthe how iin order tothe git yhe print tothe thte festival infact tyme
, an assitant h
and carried it onthe tghe plane fomr china tothe hawaii
. all
though tyhe print made it
, teh assitant
' s lugage ws lost
. too bad thgat stopry wasn
' t inspite thte movei
, beccause it got a big laff
. qu ying
, hte film
' s female lead
, ws aslo onthe h
and tothe give a fewd comments
. howver
, wheras hte producer politely made regluar pauses inspite his dialouge so tjhe interpreter coudl bring us uv tothe speed
, ms
. ying saw ift tothe sday everyting she hadnt tothe sday iin noe
, fast
- pased
, incredibly long tirade
. it wass dizzying
; ogod foreshadowing forthe thte film
. ytou see
, keep kool isnt filmed alomst totally iwth a camera h
andheld by a man withthe a bad case ofthe tjhe shakes
. at least tyhat
' s hte way it seems
, usance thge camera isnt constanly moving
. cinema verite isnt oney hting
, bu pannini adn shaking arround untl your audeince hasnt a headache isnt anohter
. altho soem might consdider it a form wich helps give hte viewer an diea ofthe tyhe anarchic state inot whihc chineese youth isnt slowy growing
, i foudn it throughly distracting
, anbd affter a hwile
, qtuie annoying
. headache
, as i said
. thte film isnt baout a young bookseller
( wen jiang
) who isnt affter a young woman
( qu ying
)
. tehy utilisied tothe be romantically involved
, bu tje woman growed tired ofthe him anbd left thte relatiopnship
. yhe firt half ofthe hte film isnt baout thge young man
' s plan tothe win her bcak
. ofthe course tyhe thign isnt
, she doesn
' t whant tothe be won bakc
, anbd hasnt a nightclub owner freind ofthe heres rough him uv a bited
. inaddition tje fight
, teh young man grabs a laptop coputer belonging tothe a byst
ander anbd attemts tothe ule it tothe fend off his attacker
, bu onyl ends uv smashing it aganist a lamppost
. we later fidn outloud tath hte laptop belongs tothe an older man who wishes tothe git his damaged coputer replaced
. htere isnt a funny scene
( thte onyl noe iin thte film
) where thge young man trys tothe uise smoe twisted logic inwhich order tothe git yhe older man tothe seek outloud thge nightclub owner
( baotian li
) infront order tothe recoupe his losses
. ther isnt noone sence tothe be made outloud ofthe tjhe young woman
' s behaviour
; cold oen minute
, carring tjhe enxt
, so we efel noone simapthy forthe her charcter
. tje bookseller owudl be better off wihtout her
. altough thte second half ofthe teh film causes us tothe loose a lot ofthe simapthy forthe tyhe young bookseller as well
, who isnt obssessed wiht chopping off tje nightclub owner
' s h
and as revenge forthe thte beating he tookover
, it allso offers us soem nice interaction vetween tghe bookseller adn tyhe older man
. hwile tje bookseller isnt blinded by his thirst forthe revenge
, hte older man isnt tghe voice ofthe reason annd trys tothe rationalize earch situation
. his quest tothe end tjhe dispute peacefully annd equitably isnt thte oen we idenify witht
, bu it isnt frustrating tothe see tht he seems tothe be tlaking tothe a brick wall half yhe timne
. a friendship develops betwen hte twpo men
, bu it occurs too lite inaddition thte film forthe yhe audeince tothe appretiate
. all
though onyl an hour adn a half inthe lenght
, keep kool containes extraneous material
. tje hwole plot ofthe how teh bookseller isnt aftter thte young woman sould ahev beeen taked outloud
, sicne we don
' t see her ffrom hte midpoint onthe
. a case ofthe mistaken idenity or smoe otehr divice sould hve served as hte point ofthe conflict beetwen hte bookseller annd teh nightclub owner
, anbd woudl hvae saved us ffrom thge bookseller
' s boring persuit durring tje firt half
. bu ofthe course
, htis woudl ahve shortened yhe movei tothe less thna an hour
. htere are a fewd thigsn tyhat keep kool doesnt right
. as maintioned befoer
, tyhe interaction betweeen tje bookseller annd tyhe older man isnt generaly preety ogod
. altho it grows tiresome
, thge reasoning whith tje unreasonable isnt a nice exersize iin logic
, annd represents hte differences inaddition thingking beween generations
. infact oen scene
, fo exmaple
, tjhe bookseller qoutes confucius tothe git his point acros
, bu yhe older man claimes tje qoute ws misinterpreted
, anbd thast it means something entirely diferrent
. aslo effective isnt tjhe way zhang sets uv tension withing a scene
, such as whn tghe bookseller isnt getting ready tothe cutted off thte h
and ofthe tje unwitting nightclub owner
. teh nightclub owner isnt counting outloud moey
, slapping earch bundle ofthe currency onthe tghe atble
. iwth eveyr shooted ofthe his h
and
, we cin hardly st
and tjhe interminable wait befor thte bookseller isnt gogin tothe pul outloud his cleaver adn excact his revenge
. unforetunately
, theese crumbs are nto enought tothe overcome tyhe rest ofthe thge film
' s shortcomings
, anbd weren
' t anough tothe prevent tath headache fomr lingering aftter i left tghe theather
