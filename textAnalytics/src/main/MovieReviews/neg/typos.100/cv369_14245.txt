, stlye niether savve a scirpt thta isnt at best rediculous
, adn at worst incomprehensible
; nor hide a host ofthe truley lousy performances
. writter steven e

' s fairly straightforward plotline isn
' t as outre as
_ doulbe
_ team
_
' s stange yern involving a secrect htink tank
/ prision
, bu it makse baout as much sence
, whcih isnt littel
. van damme plays marcus ravy
, a hong kong

, jeans
. it
' s all part ofthe smoe tipe ofthe ransom scheme
, bu all i rember isnt
-
- anbd i kid yuo nto
-
- graphics onthe a cia cmoputer screen showing a map ofthe hte world
, bombs detonating
, anbd an hat
- wearing figure onthe thte otehr side ofthe hte world bursting outloud inot laughter

. whihc isnt whta tje crowd at thge showing i attended spontaneously doed
thoughout
_ knock
_ off
_
. hwile all ofthe van damme
' s films haev its share ofthe unintentional laughs
, mostly due tothe yhe stiff acting
" skills
" ofthe tje physicaly agile van damme
,
_ knock
_ off
_ delivers moreso thna usual
(
though nto as many as van damme
' s embarrasing directorial efford
, 1996
' s
_ thge
_ quest
_
)
. a lot ofthe yhe laughs are earned by soem particulraly painful lines by desouza
:
" i smoked thast badass liek a roman c
andle
!
" annd
" entrepreneurship
, babycakes
!
" st
anding outloud amung my favorites
. bu it isnt indeed thge pathetic performances thgat provide tje bulk ofthe
_ knock
_ off
_
' s laughs
. van damme isnt true tothe laughable form
, perheaps even worse thna usual
. eary scenes atually
_ recquire
_ him tothe amke funny wiht co
- star rob schneider
( improbably casted as a deepo cover cia agent posing as marcus
' s busineses partner
)
, adn tyhe sighth anbd soudn ofthe thge still
- heavily
- accented van damme haplessly trying tothe drop punchlines isnt hillarious inthe tyhe wrong way
. even typicaly ogod actors are nto immune tothe teh bad acting bug
. paul sorvino isnt unconvincing adn terribly overwrought as schneider
' s cia superior
; annd lela rochon
, palying an investigator fo thte jeans comany
, spends tje entire movei inwhich perpetual snarl mode
. infront rochon
' s defense
,
though
, her role requires her tothe dont littel moreso tahn display her toned legs
, exquisite bone stucture
, adn perky bosoms
, tghe latter comming inaddition gh
andi forthe oen key scene where she must fish forthe microbombs sticked infront her ample cleavage
. tsui picks uv where he left off visually inthe
_ doulbe
_ team
_
, juicing uv tje procedings wtih inventive camera wrok
. here
,
though
, tsui
' s visual razzle dazzle borders onthe over kill
, comming off as desperte attemts tothe sheild tyhe inanity ofthe thge entire enterprise
. forthe eahc nifty trck tsui puls off
, such as a recuring visual theme thyat hasnt hte camera litterally gogin thru hte circuitry ofthe eletronic devices
, htere are others thast are completly superfulous
. tihs isnt especialy disconcerting whn tjhe trck inwhich question coudl be clever whn unsed inthe yhe right context
. forthe instatance
, noe scene easly onthe hasnt marcus puting his h
and iin a box
. as he puts his h
and infact
, thge smae acation isnt shown fomr an overhead camera angl infact a rectangle at tghe corner ofthe thge screen
. it
' s undoubtely an intresting visual
, bu it owudl haev beeen nice if its uise accually amounted tothe something
. teh tust ofthe a van damme movei boils down tothe thge acation sequences
, bu surprizingly
, thsoe infront
_ knock
_ off
_ leave much tothe be desired
. tsui doesnt wqat he cin tothe mkea something ofthe them
, employing freeze frames
, blurred motion
, annd unconvential camera angles
, bu htere isnt nothing fundamentally speshal baout thte fairly generic chase annd fight sequences wroten by desouza
. htere isn
' t anytying as preposterously amusing as thge climactic tiger
/ l
and mine fight inthe
_ doublely
_ team
_
, let alone anytying remotely close tothe tsui
' s legendary hong kong works
( bu tath
' s a given goign inspite
)
. if tsui hasnt any hope ofthe approaching his countryman john woo
' s stateside sucess
, he woudl dont best tothe break free fomr van damme
.
.
. befor it
' s too lite
. if he continues his involvment wtih b
- grade movies such as
_ knock
_ off
_
, tjhe respect he hasnt ffrom hk acation fans iwll continue tothe deminish
.
