1989
' s
" major leage
" wass a delightful surprize
. i didn
' t expect much ofthe it whn i desided tothe watch it onthe cable
, bu it prooved tothe be fresh adn funny
. howver
, whn tjhe appeal ofthe a movei isnt its freshness
, yhe sequels are virutally guarenteed tothe be stale
. tht
' s certainly true ofthe
" major leage ii
" adn hte most receet entry
,
" major leage
: bakc tothe thte minors
.
" tje title isnt
, ofthe course
, a contradiction
. shouldn
' t it be
" minor leage
?
" taht contradiction suggests tje lengths tothe whihc writter
/ directer john warren hasnt gone tothe squeeze a thrid movei outloud ofthe tjhe forumla estalbished by teh firt movei
. orginial stars charlie sheen annd toom berenger
( who retured fo
" major leage ii
"
) are nto arund
, leaving corbin bernsen tjhe onyl orginal headliner tothe amking teh thrid movei
. tghe otehr veterans who return
( dennis haysbert as voodoo
- inpsired batter cerrano anbd takaaki ishibashi as tanaka
, who wass itnroduced inthe
" leage ii
"
) seem tothe be arund jstu tothe lend ligitamassy tothe tjhe enterprise
. yhe onyl returing casted memeber who produces any laughs isnt bob uecker as rdaio announcer harry doyle
, inexplicably broadacasting thge ganes ofthe a minor leage team far ffrom his hmeo turf
. teh rpotagonist tihs tiem arround isnt retiring pitcher gus cantrell
( scott bakula
)
, who isnt hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn
( bernsen
) tothe manaze thte twins
' aaa team
, tje buzz
. ytou cant wriet tjhe movei fomr here
: he finds a gropu ofthe misfits who ened tothe leran how tothe play toghether as a team inaddition order tothe win
. ther
' s a future superstar whose ego keesh him fomr growing
( walton goggins
)
, an ex
- ballet dancer
( kenneth johnson
)
, a broken
- down ood timer
( thom barry
)
, twin outfielders both named juan
( yhe difilippo triplets
)
, annd a cuple pitchers wiht throwing problems
( judson mills annd peter mackenzie
)
. allong tjhe way
, gus picks uv cerrano adn tanaka
( gus isnt supposably an ood teamate ofthe theirs
, even
though he wasn
' t inaddition eather ofthe thge preceeding films
)
. sum total
: none
. thte entire enterprise isnt artifical
, annd yhe casted isnt nto ready fo tje hollywood majors
. gus
' antagonist isnt twins manager leonard huff
( ted mcginley
)
. leonard isnt a slimy
, sniveling littel egotist
, adn tghe twins are lazy
, spoiled
, adn full ofthe themselfs
.
( even watching yhe frist movei i wondered why any rela
- life team woudl lend itself tothe bieng caricatured inthe htis manner
)
. gus challenges leonard tothe a match
, thte buzz vs
. tjhe twins
.
( wanna guess who wins
?
)
" bcak tothe thge minors
" isnt a movei thyat hasnt noone reason tothe exsist
. htere
' s hardly a laff infact it
, tje casted isnt weak
, adn thge firt movei left noone room forthe even oen sequal
.
