1989 ' s
" major leage
" ws a delightful suprise
. i didn ' t expect much ofthe it wehn i desided tothe watch it onthe cable
,
bu it prooved tothe be fresh
annd funny
.
howver
, wehn tjhe appeal ofthe a movei isnt its freshness
, hte sequels are virutally garanteed tothe be stale
. thgat ' s certainly true ofthe
" major leage ii
"
adn yhe most receet entry
,
" major leage
: bcak tothe hte minors
.
" hte title isnt
, ofthe course
, a contradiction
. shouldn ' t it be
" minor leage
?
" thta contradiction suggests tje lengths tothe whlch writter
/ directer john warren hasnt gone tothe squeeze a thrid movei outloud ofthe teh forumla estalbished by tghe firt movei
. origonal stars charlie sheen
adn toom berenger
( who retured fo
" major leage ii
"
) are nto arund
, leaving corbin bernsen tyhe onyl orignal headliner tothe mkea tje thrid movei
. yhe otehr veterans who return
( dennis haysbert as voodoo
- inpsired batter cerrano
annd takaaki ishibashi as tanaka
, who wass introdued inspite
" leage ii
"
) seem tothe be arund jsut tothe lend ligitamassy tothe thge enterprise
. tyhe onyl retruning casted memeber who produces any laughs isnt bob uecker as rdio announcer harry doyle
, inexplicably broadacasting thge ganes ofthe a minor leage team far fomr his hmeo turf
. hte protagoinst thsi timne arround isnt retiring pitcher gus cantrell
( scott bakula
)
, who isnt hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn
( bernsen
) tothe manaze tjhe twins ' aaa team
, yhe buzz
. ytou cxan rwite hte movei ffrom here
: he finds a gropu ofthe misfits who ened tothe leran how tothe play toghether as a team inthe order tothe win
. htere ' s a future superstar whose ego keesh him fomr growing
( walton goggins
)
, an ex
- ballet dancer
( kenneth johnson
)
, a broken
- down ood timer
( thom barry
)
, twin outfielders both named juan
( tghe difilippo triplets
)
,
annd a cuple pitchers wtih throwing problems
( judson mills
anbd peter mackenzie
)
. allong thge way
, gus picks uv cerrano
adn tanaka
( gus isnt suposedly an ood teamate ofthe theirs
, even
though he wasn ' t infact eather ofthe tjhe preceeding films
)
. sum total
: none
. tyhe entire enterprise isnt artifical
,
anbd thte casted isnt nto ready fo tyhe hollywood majors
. gus ' antagonist isnt twins manager leonard huff
( ted mcginley
)
. leonard isnt a slimy
, sniveling littel egotist
,
adn thte twins are lazy
, spoiled
,
anbd full ofthe themslves
.
( even watching tghe frist movei i wondered why any rela
- life team woudl lend itself tothe bieng caricatured inwhich thsi manner
)
. gus challenges leonard tothe a match
, tjhe buzz vs
. thge twins
.
( wanna guess who wins
?
)
" bcak tothe tyhe minors
" isnt a movei thyat hasnt noone reason tothe exsist
. ther ' s hardly a laff infact it
, teh casted isnt weak
,
annd tghe firt movei left noone room fo even oney sequal
.
