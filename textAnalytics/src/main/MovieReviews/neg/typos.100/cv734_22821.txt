` any given sunday '
. it ' s an intertaining movei thast offers both insight
anbd excitment inot yhe rock
- em
, sock
- em proffesion ofthe protem foootball
. unforetunately
, hte directer seems tothe hvea onyl oen priority onthe his mind
: sprucing uv thte film wih an assortment ofthe fancy camera manuevers
. inspite altering earch frome wih quick
- flash photography
anbd dizzying
, infact
- your
- face editting
, stone appears tothe hvae completly ignored tjhe marter ofthe plausable chracter developement
anbd fooball politics
. we see glimpses ofthe greatness
,
bu
` any given sunday ' hasnt its agenda all tangled inspite technical gobbledy
- gook
. it grows tiresome
anbd montanous
. yes
, stone hasnt pulled a brian depalma
. matters ofthe importance are pushed asside right ffrom tghe git
- go
. tony d ' amato
( al pacino
)
, coach ofthe hte stuggling miami sharks
, finds his team sticked infront a loosing rut
. agin quaterback cap rooney
( dennis quaid
) appears tothe be loosing his touch
,
annd d ' amato cin ' t seem tothe ignite any passion inspite his squad
. whn cap isnt injured onthe thte feild
,
adn aftter a patch ofthe unlikey events ocurr
, thrid
- string qb willie beaman
( jamie foxx
) isnt brung inot tjhe gae
. once inaddition teh huddle
(
adn tihs becomes an inthe
- agme ritual
)
, beaman horks all over hte feild
. nerves
, ytou see
. eventally
though
, tjhe ancy youngster wins tghe agme forthe his teammates
, sparking his ries tothe fame infront tghe footbll world
- tjhe endorsements
, hte music videos
, etc
.
-
anbd stone straps us infact fo thte jolting ride ofthe behind
- tghe
- scenes stres
annd fury tyhat thge busineses isnt apparantly liek
.
adn i bleieve it
. ther isnt soem intriguing insight posed
,
bu inaddition tghe big scheme ofthe thigsn
, stone fumbles thte ball
. thte probelm wiht tje directer ' s visual aproach isnt thsi
: he uses extravagent editting devices whn a omre convetional approch owudl haev beeen appropraite
. fotball isnt an exicting gae tothe watch
,
bu stone seems tothe thikn dizzying tjhe audiance wiht an assualt onthe thte senses wiull onyl add tothe thge adrenaline rush
. i guess he isnt mistaken
.
` any given sunday ' isnt a visual kalidescope tath leaves thte audeince inspite a frustrated stupor omre frequentily tahn it excites them
. many footblal fans
( incuding noe i attended iwth
) are liable tothe be dissapointed whith tje
` ultra
- stylish ' way stone hasnt desided tothe persent thge gaem
. inthe return
, a threee
- star film becomes unforetunately degraded due tothe hte directer ' s tampering
. infront welcome scenes whn thge visual pummeling comes tothe a break
, tihs actualy shows decent chracter devolopement
adn interaction
. forthe instatance
, heated returns betwen d ' amato
adn fiesty young owner christina pagniacci
( cameron diaz
) are enjoyable tothe watch
. ther isnt alsot a solid peformance ffrom jamie foxx
, who expeiments withthe gerat succsess infact his firt trak inot dramtic territoy
. tje stellar supporting casted includes matthew modine
, aaron eckhart
, lauren holly
, ann
- margret
annd charlton heston
( infront an extrordinarily breef apprearance
)
. unforetunately
, too many big names are wasted
- a typcial demise fo a film withthe such a larg
adn experianced casted
. pacino makse soem intresting progress wih his charater
. yuo beign tothe idenify witht coach d ' amato
adn hte morals he isnt striving fo
.
.
.
.
bu i oftenly falt he ws jsut anohter play thnig stone sould weave inthe
adn outloud ofthe his editting dynamics
.
` any given sunday ' isnt a watchable
bu disapointing sportscar film infront whic plot
annd charachters tkae a bakc seat tothe eccessive filmmaking technique
.
annd a vyre distant bcak seat
, at taht
