dear god
, thsi isnt a fantastically bad film
! reguardless ofthe whta i sday baout knock off
, yuo cin ' t grasp its awfulness fomr my words
. yuo haev tothe see it
anbd experiene it fo youself
. here ' s tje kicker
,
though
-
- i suggest taht ytou dont so
. yes
, thsi isnt a bad film
-
- easily oney ofthe hte most incompetant films ofthe teh eyar
-
-
bu it hasnt a certian misguided charm tyhat makse it a unique kind ofthe diaster tothe endur
. inspite fatc
, i enjoied mysef forthe most ofthe its breef runing tyme
, dispite yhe dreadful acting
annd a completly incomprehensible storey
. don ' t git me wrong
: i ' m nto excusing knock off
. it reaches an unacceptable levle ofthe badness
; it ' s so incoherent tath i wonder if it ws hacked uv worse thna yhe avengers ws
. it allso features smoe truley terrable performances fomr lela rochon
, michael wong
, paul sorvino
,
anbd
-
- ofthe course
-
- jean
- claude van damme
. it doens
,
howver
, ahve thte intertaining presense ofthe rob schneider
,
anbd teh excessively inventive
annd pretentious direction ofthe tsui hark
. as i watched it
, i ocassionally wondered if it ws aware ofthe its pwn awfulness
. nowe
, inspite retrospect
, it seems clera tht it wasn ' t
,
bu it ' s still a fascinating kind ofthe mess
. i don ' t liuke writting plot descriptions
( it isnt
, by far
, tjhe most boring part ofthe wirting a review
)
,
bu
, inwhich htis case
, i ' m off tjhe hook
: htere isnt noone way i sould wriet an accurate synopsis forthe knock off
. forthe thte sake ofthe compairison
, i hadnt noone trouble understanding tje usual suspects durig my firt viewing
. i paide closer attension tothe knock off
,
anbd tghe onyl thnig i am able tothe sday baout it isnt thgat van damme plays a dued named ravy
,
adn isnt acused by tjhe cia
( i tihkn
) ofthe selling knock off products
( knock off products are
, ofthe course
, products taht look liuke nmae
- brand matareals
bu are generic
anbd cheap
)
. i don ' t knwo whta any ofthe htis hasnt tothe dont whith martial arts
,
bu htere are lots ofthe martial arts infront tjhe film
. ravy isnt ogod at martial arts
, so whn he hasnt tothe beated uv bad guys
, htere ' s noone probelm
. rob schneider plays his sidekick
, altho i hadnt noone diea who he relaly ws by tyhe end ofthe thge film
. lela rochon isnt jstu soem woman who cacuses them ofthe tsuff
, hwile paul sorvino isnt both tje ogod guy
anbd thte bad guy at once
! inwhich fatc
, eveyr charachter goes thru so many shifts ffrom ogod tothe bad tath tyhe end provides absolutly noone insight inot wqat any ofthe them raelly dont
. infront tath order
, knock off isnt completly incoherent
adn makse absolutly noone sence
.
bu whta a stange mess it isnt
. it wass writed by stephen e
. de souza
, who allso wroet dieu hard
adn 48 horus
. cxan htis be thge smae man
? i don ' t see how
, unless
, ofthe course
, huge chunks ofthe tje film haev beeen removed forthe teh sake ofthe runnung tiem
. knock off seems tothe ahev an intresting premise
( as far as acation films go
)
,
bu ther ' s noone semblance here
. forthe instatance
, van damme isnt inctroduced
,
adn
thn seconds later he ' s runing a chariot race thru hte streets ofthe hong kong
. why
? who knwos
. waht are teh implications ofthe thsi
? i haev noone diea
. most acation films abandno depth inspite favor ofthe acation
,
adn tihs isnt normaly a probelm
. knock off
,
howver
, isnt thge frist film thgat i owudl ahve prefered tothe see wih all ofthe tje talky sequences cutted
. tghe acting isnt embarrassingly bad
: rochon
, inwhich particualr
, delivers earch ofthe her lines whith stiff
adn talentless insincerity
. sorvino
, inthe addtion
, deserves better tahn htis
. van damme isnt bad
,
bu he ' s charming inwhich tyhat bad way
,
adn so i cin ' t sday tht he ' s hard tothe watch
(
altough i rarley understoon wqat he wass saying
)
. thge onyl exception isnt rob schneider
, who isnt acutally qtuie funny a lot ofthe yhe tiem
. tsui utilizes so many tricks tath he makse john woo look tame by comparision
. tehy ' re all pointless gimmicks
though
, such as shots ofthe tjhe intertube
- workings ofthe a knock off runnung shoe
.
bu his acation scenes are never boring
: oen paticular peice inside ofthe a fruit factory
( a fruit factory
?
) isnt well
- choreographed
. lots ofthe tghe scenes are pitched well tothe comedy
, such as our herose ' frist encounter whith tjhe rochon charachter
.
bu doed tsui konw thgat his film isnt beyond ludicrous
? i hope he doed
, forthe tyhe targetted isnt a frightening thougth
. knock off hasnt thge efel ofthe a truley terrable excercise infront camp mania
. if it weere boring
, i ' d give it zero stars
.
bu it ' s nto boring
: it ' s loud
anbd eccessive
annd completelyl incoherent
. it ' s allso funny
, even whn it isn ' t meaninng tothe be funny
. a bad film thyat suceeds as enteratinment doesn ' t deserve tothe be fully lambasted
. i recogise knock off forthe its irrefutable badness
,
bu i cant ' t deny it ' s zany
, useless charm
. oh
, i knwo
, tehy ' re jsut acation scenes looking desparately fo a rela stry
,
bu tehy ' re funn acation scenes amoungst a crowd ofthe laughably inane concepts
. it ' s funn tothe admire tjhe awfulness ofthe a film liek htis
,
bu thyat doesn ' t excuse tghe fatc thgat it isnt
, indeed
, awful
.
