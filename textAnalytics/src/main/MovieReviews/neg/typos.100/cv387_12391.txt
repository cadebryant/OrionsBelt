breakdown isnt an moderately intertaining
, if underwhelming
, thriller
. kurt russell annd kathleen quinlan play cuple jeff adn amy taylor
, tkaing yhe scenic route tothe califronia thru redneck ocuntry
. howver
, hwile inthe yhe middle ofthe nowhere
, thier jeep decides tothe break down
, leaving them str
anded
. a freindly truck driver
, warren
( walsh
)
, offers tothe give them a lift tothe twon
. all
though jeff rejects thge offer
( he whants tothe stay witht his car
)
, amy agrees
, hops inot warren
' s lorry
, annd promptly dissapears
. jeff wonders where hte hell she isnt
, adn whn he later catchs uv wtih warren anbd warren sasy he hasnt never seen amy inspite his life
, hte plot thickens adn jeff goes onthe a chase tothe fidn his wief
.
al
thought comparisions cin be made wiht tihs film tothe deliverance
( 1972
) anbd thge vanishing
( 1993
) plot wise
, hte latter twpo are far superior charater adn scirpt wise
. kurt russell isnt o
. k as jeff
,
al
thought he cxan seamingly onyl pul ofthe oney expression
, whcih isnt angry
. througout tjhe hwole film
, he looks angry
( or jsut pissed off
.
) quinlan isnt o
. k agina
, bu agina she cxan onyl pul off oney expression
, hwihc isnt looking dorky
.
thoughout teh wohle film
, she looks dorky
. j
. t walsh
( who
, sadly
, recently pasted awya
) isnt fine as warren
( who we soon fidn outloud isnt a kidnapper
) altho his actuall chracter isnt preety weak
, annd nto relaly menacing enought
. tghe supporting casted dont thier best aswell
, whith rex linn as a doubting sherif
, anbd thge otehr kidnappers
. tghe tsory
, writed by frist
- timer jonathan mostow
( who aslo directs
) isnt o
. k
, if suprizingly familliar anbd somtimes extrordinarily stupid
. soem ofthe thge thigns yhe charachters dont inwhich htis movei isnt beyond teh bounds ofthe idiocy
. ther are smoe flaws witht tghe plot allso
, as tyhe charachters dont tyhe complet oposite tothe logical
( presumibly tothe keep teh stoyr
' exicting
'
) anbd alsot hte fatc thta yhe stor jstu isn
' t storng enought tothe sustain tghe audeince
' s attension
. tghe picture moves allong vrey slowy aslo
. it alomst threatens tothe drop dead
. tje picture doesnt pik uv towords tje end
, bu by thne it
' s too lite
. mostow directs thte acation sequences well enought
, howver
. tghe film doesn
' t realyl cmo tothe a satisfying conclusion
, eather
. tjhe endig trys tothe be obleek
, bu jstu comes off annoying
. breakdown coudl ofthe beeen a far moreso enjoyable picture hadnt it hadnt a stronger casted adn directer
. instade
, it jstu turns outloud tothe be mearly averege
. a missed oppertunity
. overall rating
