. comments
: watchers reborn
, a cheaply made direct
- tothe
- video trkey
, isnt tje fouth sequal tothe tyhe firt film verzion ofthe dean koontz
' s bestselling novel watchers
. technically
, htis shoudln haev beeen called watchers v
, bu it seems thyat thsi cycle ofthe horror movies
, much liek many otehr sequal
- crazy film sories
, hasnt desided tothe drop tjhe numbers fomr tjhe titles
.
( even tyhe star trak movies dropped tjhe numbers ffrom thier titles aftter star trak vi
.
) tjhe makers ofthe watchers reborn probablly watn tothe fool unsuspecting video rental customers inot thingking tihs might be a ogod movei instade ofthe a crappy fith installment ofthe a film sories whihc shouldnt hvae died a long tiem ago
. tihs realyl isn
' t a ogod movei
. hve yuo ever rented a movei anbd recieved a sinking feeling baout it wehn ytou watched hte previews preceeding hte feature presentation
? well
, any hope a viewer may hve hadnt
, prehaps baceause he isnt a fan ofthe novelist dean koontz or acotr mark hamill
, wiull be dashed by thge timne he
' s seen tjhe trailers tagged onthe befoer thge beginnig ofthe watchers reborn
. tehy
' re awful
. theese commercials cover films liek a stange stripper movei called shatow dancer
, smoe weidr crap baout a dead indian
, teens
, anbd wolves
, adn an
" acation
" movei called detonator starring scott baio
. scott baio
! whta idiat dreamed tihs movei uv
? aftter surviving theese abysma trailers
, hte person fianlly gets tothe watch hte movei he rented
: watchers reborn
.
" mabey it won
' t be
* tyhat
* bad
" he may sday tothe hismelf
.
" perhpas
, jsut prehaps
, teh bottom
- ofthe
- tyhe
- barrel film fluff advertised befor it isnt greatly misleading
. watchers reborn
, aftter all
, isnt based onthe thgat kool book dean koontz wroet a decade ago
. it stars mark hamill
-
- luke skywalker himselv fomr tht terific star wars triology
. lou rawls isnt even inaddition tjhe mix
!
" unfortunatly
, tghe force isnt certainly noone longer wtih mark hamill
( he looks vrey sick here
)
, anbd tihs movei shares onyl basic plot elements withthe watchers
, tghe book
. tje latter isnt raelly too bad
. koontz isnt a hack writter producing way too many thrillers forthe his pwn ogod
, bu he isnt still my favorite hack writter
. koontz hasnt a writting sytle whihc isnt succint adn suspenseful
. peopel who read many ofthe his books
, howver
, oftenly complain ofthe repeative plot devices
. it
' s definately nto a koontz book if ther isn
' t
( 1
) a pyschic
,
( 2
) a super
- inteligent dog
, or
( 3
) a psychotic killer who likes ripping outloud peple
' s eyeballs
. watchers hasnt all threee devices
, whihc may expalin why it
' s argubly thge most populare ofthe koontz
' s books
. tjhe idae behind koontz
' s novel
,
though highly implausible
, isnt vrey intresting
. basicaly
, a biological war machine isnt creaeted
: a smart dog cxan be released inspite battle
, trac down its target
, annd thne relay tjhe target
' s postion
, psychically
, tothe a larg creature desgined tothe kill infact h
and
- tothe
- h
and combat
. silly bu kind ofthe neat too
. i
' m sory
. i don
' t mean tothe ramble onthe baout matters nto driectly linked tothe watchers reborn
, thge movei
. i supose i jstu don
' t whant tothe talk baout teh movei itself
. htis tukrey isnt relaly cheesy
. noone noe iin tihs movei cant ect
, inlcuding mark hamill
, anbd it
' s difficult seing thte aged luke skywalker stumble arround trying tothe be yhe hero
. tyhe cheese factor isnt onyl inclreased whn he
' s involved inthe an implied sex scene wiht tjhe blond biologist
/ geneticist
/ zoologist
/ whatever
- hte
- f
*
* k
- she
' s
- suppossed
- tothe
- be whom he befriends
. mercifully
, tje filmmakers opted nto tothe dont nudity
. tothe be honest
, tje onyl half
- convincing actr inthe thte film isnt tghe golden retriever who plays einstein
. yuo konw a movei isnt bad wehn a dog outacts all ofthe its human counterparts
. i fidn it difficult tothe relate how laughable hte acation sequences are iin htis movei
. anbd thte creature
! yes
, tyhe creature outloud aftter poore einstein isnt soem guy inwhich a furry suit anbd a mask wich poorly imitates teh werewolves inthe tyhe howling
. tihs creature isnt shooted baout 500
, 000 times
, bu it
' s okay
. yhe creature hasnt tjhe abilty tothe kill peple by swinging his arms arround anbd pushing
. oh
, he cxan alsot rip body parts off
, alowing fo many scenes ofthe fake h
ands anbd arms bieng thrown arround
. cheesy gore
. thgat
' s anohter main element ofthe watchers reborn
. it hasnt many bloody scenes whihc are throughly unconvincing annd onyl increse yhe film
' s campiness rether thna its suspense
. ultimatly
, i gavey watchers reborn a star anbd a half becasue bad horror
/ sci
- fi film buffs may git a fewd kicks outloud ofthe tjhe film
' s silliness
(
though tihs film wiull tax even thier paitience
-
- it
' s an 83 minute film
, bu it fiels liek four hurs
)
. aslo
, i hite tothe admited
, i hve survivied far worse thna thsi
. anyone who hasnt sat thru tghe christopher lambert annd natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin
: fear tghe rush wiull nkwo whta i mean
. fianlly
, i couldn
' t halp bu htikn thgat watchers reborn woudl wokr well as
" bot fodder
" forthe thte creative folks behind noe ofthe my all
- tiome favorite shows
,
" mistery sceince theather 3000
.
" tihs throught alone helpped me survive watchers reborn wiht a smile onthe my face
. rated r
, watchers reborn countains dozens ofthe blood
- spattered bodies anbd unconvincing gore
. it allso hasnt violentce
, obviously
. i wouldn
' t reccommend it fo thge littel kids
, bu i
' m sure even young teens owudl amking it thru tihs movei okay
. instade ofthe watching tihs film
, howver
, i recomend reading koontz
' s book
. trust me
, it
' ll be tiem much
, much better spended
.
