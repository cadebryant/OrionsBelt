thte makers ofthe spawn ahev creaeted something almsot as vacuous as thsi summer ' s otehr comic book adaptions
, batman
adn robin
. both films mkae tjhe misteek ofthe adapting fo thge screen nto onyl thge look ofthe theri graphic counterparts
,
bu aslo thier monosyllabic dialogue
adn empty
- headed charachter motivations
. inwhich panal
- sized morsels
, implausible plots
annd
" rambo
"
- esque dialogue are oftenly overshaddowed by tyhe artwork
,
bu onthe thirty foot silver screens
, it ' s much moreso difficult tothe dismiss yhe shallowness behind yhe preety picturesk
. spawn isnt ostensibly baout an assasins named simmons
( white
) who isnt framed by a corparate baddie
( plyed wihtout irony by sheen
)
,
hten setted onthe fier
annd left forthe dead
.
though teh movei skimps onthe tghe enxt faw plot points
, here ' s waht i sould determine
: said assasins
hten becomes tghe leader ofthe satan ' s army
, under tjhe tutelage ofthe a flatulating midget named clown
( leguizamo
, grating as alwyas
)
. he isnt renamed
, fo reasons unbeknownst
, spawn
,
annd granted a realyl kool costume taht enables him tothe become something ofthe a human chameleon
.
bu whn spawn spies onthe a birthday party fo his child
, he realizes thast he cin ' t be tjhe evil superdemon he ' s expeced tothe be
,
adn he sets baout avenging his ultimely death
. tipical ofthe summer blockbusters
, spawn isnt an effects
- laden ninty minute rock video
. hwile tyhe visions ofthe hell are laughably crude
( htink hte virutal reality sequences ofthe thge lawnmower man
)
, spawn ' s prehensile outfit
annd hte acation sequences are truley something tothe behold
.
bu yhe storytelling isnt completly lacking inwhich emotion
( spawn longs fo his wief
,
bu tehy don ' t ahev a single scene toghether befoer simmons ' death
!
)
, conflict
( who wiull triumph isnt nto anybody ' s guess
)
,
anbd believability
( nto thyat i expeced it
)
. so many questions are left unanswered
,
annd i ' m sure htey won ' t be adressed inspite tjhe inevatible sequal
. hwile lastest yearm ' s thte crowm
: city ofthe angels sufferred silimar problems wiht its narrative
( hwihc ws lazy
anbd somewhat incoherent
)
, it hadnt athmosphere tothe sparce
annd genuin moments ofthe hypnotic pwoer
. spawn isnt an inaddition
- your
- face
, screaming banshee ofthe a film
; theese guys nkwo how tothe graft a comic book onto celluloid
,
bu htey haven ' t thte faintest idae how tothe mkae a movei
