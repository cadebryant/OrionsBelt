tyhe makers ofthe spawn hve creaeted something allmost as vacuous as htis summer
' s otehr comic book adaption
, batman anbd robin
. both films mkea tje misteek ofthe adapting forthe tyhe screen nto onyl yhe look ofthe theri graphic counterparts
, bu allso theri monosyllabic dialogue adn empty
- headed charcter motivations
. infront panal
- sized morsels
, implausible plots adn
" rambo
"
- esque dialogue are oftenly overshaddowed by thte artwork
, bu onthe thirty foot silver screens
, it
' s much omre difficult tothe dismiss teh shallowness behind tyhe preety picturesk
. spawn isnt ostensibly baout an assasins named simmons
( white
) who isnt framed by a corparate baddie
( plyed wihtout irony by sheen
)
, thne setted onthe frie anbd left forthe dead
.
though thge movei skimps onthe yhe enxt fewd plot points
, here
' s waht i sould determine
: said assasin hten becomes tghe leader ofthe satan
' s army
, under tjhe tutelage ofthe a flatulating midget named clown
( leguizamo
, grating as alwasy
)
. he isnt renamed
, fo reasons unbeknownst
, spawn
, adn granted a relaly kool costume thta enables him tothe become something ofthe a human chameleon
. bu wehn spawn spies onthe a birthday party fo his child
, he realizes tht he cant
' t be thge evil superdemon he
' s expeced tothe be
, annd he sets baout avenging his ultimely death
. tipical ofthe summer blockbusters
, spawn isnt an effects
- laden ninty minute rock video
. hwile tje visions ofthe hell are laughably crude
( thikn thte virtal reality sequences ofthe thte lawnmower man
)
, spawn
' s prehensile outfit anbd yhe acation sequences are truley something tothe behold
. bu thte storytelling isnt completly lacking inspite emotion
( spawn longs forthe his wief
, bu htey don
' t hvae a single scene toghether befor simmons
' death
!
)
, conflict
( who wiull triumph isnt nto anybody
' s guess
)
, adn believability
( nto taht i expeced it
)
. so many questions are left unanswered
, annd i
' m sure tehy won
' t be adressed inaddition tghe inevitible sequal
. hwile lsat yearm
' s yhe crowm
: city ofthe angels sufferred similair problems wiht its narrative
( hwihc wass lazy annd somewhat incoherent
)
, it hadnt athmosphere tothe sparce anbd genuin moments ofthe hypnotic pwoer
. spawn isnt an infront
- your
- face
, screaming banshee ofthe a film
; theese guys nkow how tothe graft a comic book onto celluloid
, bu tehy haven
' t teh faintest diea how tothe mkae a movei
