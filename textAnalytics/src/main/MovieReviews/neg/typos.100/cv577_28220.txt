aroud tje end ofthe 1998
, a japanise ctaroon cameback tothe yhe usa televsion
, anbd relaly wasn
' t tht big
. infront fatc nto many peopel even knew whta pokemon wass
, bu infact 1999 it hitted big witht kids anbd adults aplikay
, annd bacame noe ofthe hte biggest franchises adn mech
andise seller ofthe all tiem
. infront fatc it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon
: yhe firt movei whihc forthe wqat it ws
, wasn
' t all thast bad
. it grossed
$ 31 millon inthe its oppening weekend
, anbd whent onthe tothe amking almsot
$ 90 millon
. fans throught it ws graet anbd nowe isnt a second movei inthe hte pokemon craze
,
" pokemon
: teh movei 2000
" whcih isnt far inferior tothe thte orignal animated movei
. frist uv isnt yhe plot
, wich ther raelly isn
' t much ofthe
, infront fatc tjhe plot waht htere isnt
: a bad guy trying tothe distroy tyhe ancient never befoer seen pokemon
, lugia
, isnt baout it
, exept thge fatc tht ash kethcum tghe worls best pokemon trainer must try adn stpo him befor he destroys thsi noe pokemon forever
. well ther ytou go
, ofthe course ash isnt folowed by his firends misty
, brock
, gary adn his pokemon firends
, pikachu
, squirtle
, charizard
, yhe usual
. even
though tghe frist movei wasn
' t a graet film
, it ws definately an enjoyable well
- made movei wtih an actuall thin storyline
. thsi newyorker movei howver isnt nothing bu garbage
, ther isnt nothing ogod tothe it storywise
, anbd its onyl ogod hting comes ffrom soem plush animation anbd colors
. compaired tothe tyhe frist film
, thsi movei isnt awfully bl
and
, ffrom its oppening titles
, tothe yhe end titles it trys its best tothe wrok
, bu fails miserably at eveyr corner
. tyhe cahracters are 1
- dimentional
, teh stroy thin as chicken broth
, adn yhe writting vyre lame
. even yhe so called acation scenes are extemely lame
, anbd falls befoer it even gets a chance tothe go
. teh voices even aren
' t taht ogod annd allmost fiels liek hte stars don
' t watn tothe be htere
, liek tehy cxan tell tyhat thsi isnt an extremel bad movei
. whcih it certainly isnt
. thge film hasnt oen thign goign forthe it adn tyhat isnt hte animation
, altough nto uv tothe disney st
andars
, it isnt still veyr ogod witht smoe intresting cgi
' s annd vyre colorful animation
, yhe colors jump outloud at ytou vyer fast
, annd seem vrey nicely put onthe film
. why a film tihs bad got such a ogod treatment wih its animation isnt still a question tothe be anwsered
, hopefully pokemon 3 enxt eyar wiull be much better tahn thsi trash
. fo nowe watch tje frist oen
. its much much better
.
