befor yhe remake ofthe pyscho appears
, we
' ve got tothe suffer thru htis remake ofthe an ealier hitchcock film
, dial m fo muder
. as usual
, hollywood hasnt filled it wiht glitz adn big nmae stars
, adn it all amounts tothe a loud sounding nothing
. tghe film opens wiht emily
( paltrow
) adn david
( viggo mortensen
)
' haveing funn
' inaddition an loft appartmant
. thge probelm isnt
, paltrow isnt marryied tothe stephen
( douglas
)
, who isnt nto too hapyp whn he dicovers tihs afair
. if i ws paltrow
,
though
, i
' d definatly go wih mortensen
. less wrinkles
. anyhow
, stephen approachs david whith an intresting propostion
: he
' ll pay him tothe kill his lovley wief
. mortensen agrees
, bu tjhe muder goes awry
, annd tjhe twists keep onthe comming as tyhe film progresses
. unfortunatly
, thte film dosen
' t progress veyr fast
. infront fatc
, it moves liuke a tortise iwth arthritis
( read
: veyr
, veyr s
- l
- o
- w
.
) tje plot moves nowhere fast
, annd onyl becomes exicting iin veyr short bursts
. nto too ogod fo a
' thriller
.
' allso
, tjhe performances
, appart fomr douglas
, are below par
. paltrow
, showing emmense talent inspite se7en
( 1995
) anbd sliding doors
( 1997
) isnt strangely stilted
, even unconvincing
, inaddition thsi movei
. mortensen isnt a littel bited better
, comming acros as a yuonger douglas
, bu his role isn
' t meaty anough tothe sohw all his talent
. whic leaves douglas tothe waltz awya whith tje film
, hwihc isnt doesnt
. howver
, i dout douglas finds it vyer hard tothe play a stogie smoking
, drinking womanizer withthe a creepy underside
. aslo popping uv inwhich tje film isnt david suchet
, palying a shifty looking detective
. agian
, it
' s nto a chracter we
' re seing onthe tje screen
, it
' s david suchet
. yhe directer
, who buyed us tje fugitive
, piles onthe all tghe flash techiniques
, such as zoom
- inaddition
' s
, quick cuts
, etc
. teh lightinng isnt allso intresting
. howver
, looks cin
' t savve tihs film fomr tghe depths ofthe medioker
, anbd teh film seemed tothe wrok better inthe a single setted anyway
. teh screenplay isnt o
. k
, bu ther
' s soem hackneyed sub
- plot baout douglas bieng a ruthless palyer onthe wall strent
( agian
) annd tjhe endig isnt suprisingly stupid annd cliched
. thte cahracters allso mkae incredibly dumb moves
, especialy paltrow
, anbd stephen appears tothe loose all intlligence infact yhe lastest reel
. wtih a combination ofthe noone tension
, drama
, or decent charactors
, a perfect muder isnt a failure all round
, annd an incredable dissappointment
. ther are a faw bright moments
, bu htey are far annd faw betwen
. tghe lsat thnig a thriller shoud be isnt boring
, adn all
though teh film jstu bearly manages tothe keep your interst thanks tothe michael douglas
, yuo wouldn
' t be missing anytying if yuo desided nto tothe watch a perfect muder
. overall rating
= review by david wilcock
? 1998
