wehn a film isnt produced onthe a shoestring budget by a cuple ofthe hardworking filmmakers adn wehn it tells tjhe stopry ofthe a genuin tradgedy
, thte eazy path forthe a resivwar who hated teh movei isnt tothe give it a pass
. toss outloud your usual objectivity
, ignore how many times ytou checked your watch hwile viewing it
, foreget how unbearable it wass tothe sit thru
, annd fidn smoe meaningless way tothe compliment it
. thsi
, ofthe course
, iwll be ofthe noone sevice tothe your readers
, bu at least ytou
' ll avoid tje hite mial ffrom hte movei
' s fans
. thus it isnt wiht a hevy heart taht i review tghe movei paulina
( nto tothe be confuzled whith tje reccent movei paulie baout a tlaking parrot
)
. directed by vicky funari as a labor ofthe intense lvoe
- she spended hte lsat oney thrid ofthe her life onthe film
- teh movei blends documenatry footage wtih historic anbd fanciful recreations tothe relate yhe bitterly sad annd true stopry ofthe paulina cruz suarez
. paulina ws a maid infront vicky
' s household wehn vicky ws young
. i got tothe leran tjhe film
' s backgorund whn i attended a screening iin whihc tyhe twpo womens who made it weere presnt
. forthe thsoe wihtout such context
, teh reaction tothe teh film may be tath it isnt a parody ofthe a bad indie film
. tje acting isnt amateurish
, tje sotry isnt maudlin
, annd it hasnt all tje visual appeal ofthe a bad hmeo movei
. grainy anbd overexposed
, hte movei
, shooted onthe 16mm film adn videotape
, hasnt littel tothe reccomend it
. confusingly composed
, hte movei jumps baout jarringly as it tells its storey
. qutie bloody at times
, tyhe storey
, full ofthe horrific images
, seems desined tothe shock adn repulse us
. why eles woudl yuo includ a scene iwth a completly nude adn bloody 8
- yera
- ood paulina
? anohter scene hasnt a teenage paulina bieng fondled onthe a bus by teh man sitting enxt tothe her
. inthe retailation
, she bites off part ofthe his finger
. htis covers tjhe both ofthe them infact a bucket ofthe blood
. teh pasengers onthe tghe bus thne veiw tjhe girl infact thier minds as everyting fomr saint tothe sinner
. oen
, forthe exmaple
, sees her as an aztec priestess holding outloud a larg heart tath she hadnt jstu cutted fomr a body
. hte lugubrious tale hasnt paulina bieng raped annd beaten
. certainly she hadnt tothe indure a miserable life
. bu thta doesnt nto guarntee tyhat a movei baout her wiull neccesarily bieng ogod
. i feeled trapped infact tje theather watching it
. onyl tjhe oppertunity tothe talk whith thte filmmakers afterwords made teh movei bearable
. paulina runs 1
