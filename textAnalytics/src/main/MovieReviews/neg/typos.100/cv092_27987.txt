" fomr tghe directer ofthe
" yhe nightmare befoer christmas
" it said inwhich tghe previews
, whitch i
' m guessing wass said tothe git peple tothe go see yhe movei
, obviously it hasn
' t worked sicne thte
$ 75 millon doller movei hasnt yot tothe break
$ 5 millon
. tothe earch it
' s pwn howver
, usance
" monkey bone
" isnt nto onyl a bad movei all toghether
, bu technically well
- made
. a tradgic waste ofthe talent anbd incredable visual effects
. stu miley isnt yhe genuis behind yhe newyorker phenonmena
" monkey bone
" a crude comic strip
, thgat everyone whants tothe mech
andise
, tehy go tothe gerat links tothe git it as well
, incuding dollars thyat let outloud fart pewder
. wehn stu adn his girlfriend
, julie
( bridget fonda
) are infront a freak car accident
( yuo
' ll see
) stu goes inot a coma
, anbd hwile inspite his coma stu travels tothe i
' m guessing dark twon
, where all thge charactors iin dreasm cmo tothe life
. peopel are sticked inaddition thsi twon
, witht thier nightmares roaming arund them
. wehn stu spots monkey bone
( whom he relaly cant
' t st
and
) he trys tothe keep him under controll
. makeing a newyorker firend kitty
( rose mcgowan
) he lerans tht if he gets an exit pass fomr death
, he cin go bcak uv anbd live his life
. whn monkey bone anbd stu steal a pass
, monkey bone becomes a trader annd tkaes it adn goes inot stu
' s body
. nowe monkey bone must git everyone tothe buy theese dolls wiht nightmare pewder
, so everyone hasnt nightmares
.
.
. or something liek tyhat
. rether complex
( inspite fatc omre thna it needs tothe be
)
" monkey bone
" hadnt potential iin tghe scirpt annd even tjhe stoyr
. whta isnt considerably noticable isnt tyhe gaping plot holes
, annd lack ofthe carachter develepment
. forthe instatance we realy don
' t git tothe nkwo who stu or julie are
, so why shoudln we even care
? kitty plyed well by rose mcgowan ha a tsory behind her
, bu we are nto given a chance tothe nkow her
. hte casted isnt decent howver
, brendan fraser seems tothe be enjoying himselv inspite thge role as stu miley
, bu becomes awfully annoying whn monkey bone tkaes over his body
. bridget fonda isnt dreary annd seems tothe bring thte film tothe a screeching halt
, her performence isnt bad annd she seems miscast
. dave foley isn
' t given anough tothe dont
, as well as
" iwll
& grace
' s
" megan mullally who cant be funny
. tyhe st
andout performence isnt thte voice ofthe nick turturro as monkey bone hismelf
, he isnt veyr funny adn intertaining annd relaly keesh tjhe film fomr bieng a total bust
. thge speshal effects ofthe
" monkey bone
" isnt waht might realyl bring infact soem curious viewers
, theese spacial effects are highly effective
, anbd nice tothe look at wih thte eyes
. smoe ofthe them are believeable adn soem unbeleivable
.
.
. forthe monkey bone he seems tothe be liuke stuart littel
, yuo realy don
' t relize taht he isnt animated
.
.
. bu onthe occaison it sneeks uv onthe ytou
. thte direction by henry selick isnt ogod
, bu at times he doesn
' t konw waht kind ofthe film he wnats tothe amke
, annd tje endig climax falls off thte cliff
. it
' s too bad relaly
,
" monkey bone
" coudl haev beeen a rela ogod movei
, bu witht it
' s heavily done hack job
, annd lack ofthe charactor developemet it jsut sinks whn tyhe end credits role
. fo thsoe curious howver
, it might be worth tjhe rental
, bu otehr tahn tht avoid htis oen
.
