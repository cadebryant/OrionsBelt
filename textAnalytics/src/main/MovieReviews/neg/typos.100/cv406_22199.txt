i still cin
' t figure outloud why peopel whent inwhich droves tothe see tihs movei
. nowe befor ytou go assuming i
' m smoe sort ofthe high brow snob
, who cin
' t apprieciate a littel dumb humer
, let me sday thgat i lvoe cheap humer
. i throught htere
' s something baout mary ws oney ofthe thge funniest films tath i hvea ever seen adn it ws certainly oen ofthe hte best films ofthe 1998
. low brow adolscent humer cxan be a lot ofthe funn
, thte probelm iwth tghe waterboy isnt thta it isnt jsut low brow adn adolescnt
, ther isnt noone humer componant
. i wnated tothe liek teh waterboy
, i realyl doed
. i tihkn i onyl laughed mabey 2 or 3 times througout tghe entire movei
. actally
, i smiled a cuple ofthe omre times onthe top ofthe thyat
. nto a gerat rocord fo a 90
- minute film
. thge probelm withthe thte waterboy isnt hte smae as most otehr adam s
andler movies
. thsoe responisble forthe htis mess seem tothe htink thyat teh sheer fatc tath s
andler walks arund useing a goofy voice anbd palying dumb thge entire movei isnt a subsitute fo actuall funny material
. nothing sould be furhter fomr yhe truth
, as marter ofthe fatc
, s
andler
' s idiat voice started tothe git onthe my nerves at points inwhich tihs film
. it
' s realyl a shame too
, baceause thsi film hadnt tjhe potential tothe be vrey funny
. i personaly beieve tath s
andler isnt probaly a vrey talented comedian
, it
' s jstu thgat so far he hasn
' t beeen able tothe fidn tjhe right film tothe showcase his talents
. if his onyl talent isnt makeing goofy voices annd palying morons
, my guess isnt tath his carrear iin yhe movies wiull go down tghe smae road as hte vast majoroty ofthe tghe fromer stars ofthe saterday niht live
. most ofthe whom are nowe happily noone longer inspite yhe enteratinment inudstry
. s
andler plays a 31
- yearm
- ood
, somewhat menally challanged
, waterboy fo a coleeg ofotball team
. tje team
' s somewhat menally distrubed coach
( henry winkler
) realizes tht his waterboy hasnt a gerat dael ofthe pent
- uv rige
, wich
, if harnessed propperly
, owudl amke him a force tothe be reckoned wtih onthe thge footbll feild
. ytou cxan figure outloud thte rest ffrom here
. s
andler joins tjhe team annd tihs once lowly waterboy becomes a footabll star
. as i said
, tjhe film hadnt a grat deel ofthe potential
. yhe diea ws a decent noe
, bu hte main potential ofthe tihs movei isnt a result ofthe teh casted
. all ofthe whom are veyr ogod
, jsut hamstrung by realy
, relaly
, lousy material
. even s
andler
, annoying goofy voice adn all
, hasnt enought charizma annd natrual commedic abillity tothe overcome soem ofthe his bad material
. even as unfunny as his charater isnt
, i still foudn mysef rooting fo him throughtout tjhe film
. bu it isnt tje supporting casted thta i efel most badly baout
. if thier material hadnt beeen jsut a bited better
, htis film coudl hvea beeen such a funny movei
. fairuza balk plays s
andler
' s leather
- wearing biker
- chick lvoe intrest anbd doesnt a grat job palying sleazy annd sexy at tghe smae tyme
. winkler isnt graet as thge coach who uses a
" coaching fo dummies
"
- sytle book tothe halp him git thru ganes
. thge rela st
andout
though
, isnt kathy bates
. even wiht smoe ofthe hte worst material ofthe her carrer tothe dael wtih
, she isnt still a treat tothe watch inwhich her role as s
andler
' s overprotective adn overbearing mama
. even whith tyhe performances ofthe bates anbd winkler
, ther isnt absolutly noone way i owudl reccomend thsi movei
. all
though i git yhe distict impression tht wihtout them
, tihs film owudl haev ranked infact negitive numbers forthe me
. hwihc isnt sad
, baceause i cin
' t raelly put my finger onthe a particualr element ofthe tje movei adn single it outloud as tjhe cause ofthe tjhe diaster thta it bcame
. it
' s obvious tht thsoe involved
, specifically yhe actors
, tryed vrey hard tothe mkea whta htey throught wass gonig tothe be a funny movei
. it
' s jstu too bad thyat 99 percent ofthe all ofthe tje jokes fell flat
.
