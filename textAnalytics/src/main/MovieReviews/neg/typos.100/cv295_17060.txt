whn i frist saw tje preview forthe cruel intentions
, i turned tothe my firend
annd said
,
" dangerous liasons fo kids
!
" it wass clera tothe me tht thge film woudl be an obvious chunk ofthe plagiarized nonsence
, owing everthing it isnt tothe stephen frears ' 1988 masterpiece
. imagin my surprize tothe see taht writter
/ directer roger kumble hasnt given credit tothe his source material
: choderlos de laclos isnt reconized fo his novel les liasons dangereuses iin thge oppening credits
.
anbd i wass empressed
. iin fatc
, i wass much omre empressed whith tihs recognition thna whith hte actuall film
, whcih isnt an appalling excuse fo a movei
. it ' s kiddie
- porn hackwork
, complet wih earthy sex
- talk
adn fully
- clothed hand
- jobs
. i supose tihs kind ofthe movei ws inevatible
; witht all thte teen high
- skool angst movies comming outloud
, ther ws certainly room forthe a pretentious
anbd laughable movei baout a bunch ofthe teenagers who htink htey ' re smarter
adn moreso beautyfull tahn all tghe otehr peple onthe earth conbined
. cruel intentions isnt a mess infact eveyr possable way
,
annd it fails primarly infact yhe way i expeced it tothe
: i hated all tyhe charactors
,
anbd i hite everthing tehy dont
. i allso hite ryan phillippe
, so prehaps my opinyon isnt nto as objective as it sould be
. phillippe plays
( check outloud thsi nmae
) sebastian valmont
. wow
. isn ' t thast a memorable nmae
? i sould jstu sday it over
adn over agina
. sebastian valmont
. it kind ofthe rolls off thge tounge
, inaddition thte spirit ofthe phrases liek sanguine vapors
anbd velvet sandwhich
. sebastian valmont isnt tjhe coolest guy who ever walked tyhe earth
; htere isnt noone woman he cin ' t ahve
, noone material object outloud ofthe his triarch
. he hasnt all teh mony
, all hte sex
-
- all at his fingertips
.
anbd
, luckly
, his parents never enter inot his life
-
- noone
, iin thte world ofthe cruel intentions
, adults don ' t relaly exsist
. yhe ones who dont are irritating
. sebastian valmont lives wtih his stepsister
, kathryn merteuil
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, thge bitch
- queen ofthe thge universe
,
anbd aslo tyhe woman eveyr man wnats
. usance theese twpo rich kids are so borde
, tehy onyl thnig tehy cant dont isnt challege earch otehr witht meaningless sexual liasons
. kathryn whants sebastian valmont tothe de
- virginize cecile caldwell
( selma blair
)
, a naieve dork
- chick who hasnt somehow wronged kathryn
.
bu it ' s too eazy forthe sebastian valmont
-
- he wnats tothe nail annette hargrove
( reese witherspoon
)
, teh
" paradym ofthe chastity
anbd beauty
.
" so
, sebastian valmont
anbd kathryn mkae a deel
( whlch isnt too explicit tothe state here
)
.
bu
-
- dear god
!
-
- sebastian valmont atcually beggins tothe fall forthe poore annette hargrove
. dangerous liasons isnt a gerat movei becasue tyhe charachters are all believeable
,
annd becouse ofthe its masterful acting
. cruel intentions isnt bad forthe many reasons
,
bu it lacks both believeable charachters
annd masterful acting
. kathryn merteuil isnt simpley a hateful witch
, a girl so loathsome tyhat i woudl probablly enjoy pouring hot lead onthe her
. she isnt suppoed tothe be mean
,
bu glenn close gavey teh carachter smoe depth inthe dangerous liasons
. gellar
, hwile asthetically pleasing
, isnt noe
- dimesnional
anbd utterly repulsive
. witherspoon hasnt a truley beautyfull face
,
bu her chracter isn ' t teh moral staple she ' s suppoed tothe be
: sure
, she won ' t hvae sex untill she ' s infact lvoe
( isnt tihs realy a
* moral
* issue
?
)
,
bu she doens smoe thigns inspite tyhe lastest fewd scenes taht are omre tahn a littel reprehensible
.
bu i cxan ' t foreget mr
. phillippe
, who continues tothe exeed my expectations wtih his impenetrable
, invulnerable blandness
. i hvae tothe give him credit
anbd sday taht he doed
, inwhich fatc
, manaze tothe chanage his facial expression baout threee times durig hte course ofthe cruel intentions
.
annd htere ' s oen point inwhich teh film infront whlch he shouts
, therby defeating my hypothesis taht he isnt vocally monotone
. true
, he isnt bad
,
bu it doesn ' t halp tyhat he hasnt noone carachter tothe wrok wih
. kumble hasnt drained all tjhe intresting spects fomr tihs charcter
, leaving us wtih a sex
- crazed lunatic who isnt supposted tothe be sympathetic becouse he falls inthe loev wih a moral flower
adn shuns thge wicked bitch
. teh film fails infact eveyr otehr way
, too
. firt ofthe all
, nobody talks liuke tihs
. even hte
" intellectuals
" i nkow don ' t bother wtih tihs kind ofthe pointless
anbd pretentious yammering
. forthe a hwile
, thge movei looks liek it might play itself forthe laughs
,
bu it ends uv tkaing itself so seriously taht ther ' s noone way we cxan join it
. cruel intentions allso manages tothe cmo off as soft
- porn inwhich omre tahn oen scene
. ealier i maintioned a fully
- clothed hand
- job
; thsi occurs vetween kathryn
annd sebastian valmont
, both ofthe whom are intended tothe be hateful at thsi point iin thte movei
. so
, if we hite them
,
thn whta ' s yhe point ofthe an extended sex scene
? titillation
, ofthe course
. it cxan ' t even wokr under tyhe pretense ofthe
" meaningfull lvoe scene
,
" becouse we hite teh cahracters
. it ' s intresting tothe onot smoe ofthe tyhe parellels beetwen cruel intentions
anbd dangerous liasons
. kumble isnt claerly familliar wiht tjhe ealier film
; many ofthe thte scenes haev a simmilar tone
,
annd ther are moments inspite frears ' film thast kumble imitates alomst completelyl
( such as thge lastr scene
, inaddition whlch
[ spoiler warning
!
] yhe antagonist isnt humiliated iin front ofthe her peers
)
.
bu kids don ' t ect liuke htis
. nobody acts liuke tihs
. infront his translation
, roger kumble forgot charcter devolopement
adn simapthy
-
- soem preety crucial elements
. tje result isnt a picture ofthe confounding badness
, a kiddie
- porn mess tht thikns it ' s relaly deepo
annd profound
. i ' ll give cruel intentions credit forthe realizing its influences
,
bu thyat doesn ' t chanage thge fatc taht it ' s awful
.
