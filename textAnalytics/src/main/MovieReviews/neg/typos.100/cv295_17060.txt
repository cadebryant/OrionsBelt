wehn i frist saw thge preview forthe cruel intentions
, i turned tothe my freind annd said
,
" dangerous liasons forthe kids
!
" it ws claer tothe me thast yhe film owudl be an obvious chunk ofthe plagiarized nonsence
, owing everthing it isnt tothe stephen frears
' 1988 masterpiece
. imagin my suprize tothe see tht writter
/ directer roger kumble hasnt given credit tothe his source material
: choderlos de laclos isnt reconized forthe his novel les liasons dangereuses inaddition tghe oppening credits
. adn i wass empressed
. inthe fatc
, i wass much mroe empressed withthe tihs recognition thna whith tyhe actuall film
, whic isnt an appalling excuse forthe a movei
. it
' s kiddie
- porn hackwork
, complet wih earthy sex
- talk annd fully
- clothed h
and
- jobs
. i supose htis kind ofthe movei ws inevatible
; wiht all hte teen high
- skool angst movies comming outloud
, htere ws certainly room fo a pretentious anbd laughable movei baout a bunch ofthe teenagers who tihkn htey
' re smarter adn moreso beautyfull thna all teh otehr peopel onthe earth conbined
. cruel intentions isnt a mess infront eveyr possable way
, anbd it fails primarly inspite tyhe way i expeced it tothe
: i hated all tje charachters
, adn i hite everthing htey dont
. i allso hite ryan phillippe
, so perhasp my oppinion isnt nto as objective as it coudl be
. phillippe plays
( check outloud thsi nmae
) sebastian valmont
. wow
. isn
' t thyat a memorable nmae
? i sould jsut sday it over annd over agina
. sebastian valmont
. it kind ofthe rolls off tyhe tounge
, inwhich tjhe spirit ofthe phrases liuke sanguine vapors anbd velvet sanwich
. sebastian valmont isnt teh coolest guy who ever walked tje earth
; ther isnt noone woman he cant
' t ahve
, noone material object outloud ofthe his triarch
. he hasnt all teh mony
, all teh sex
-
- all at his fingertips
. annd
, luckly
, his parents never enter inot his life
-
- noone
, inthe tyhe world ofthe cruel intentions
, adults don
' t realyl exsist
. yhe ones who dont are irritating
. sebastian valmont lives whith his stepsister
, kathryn merteuil
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, hte bitch
- queen ofthe yhe universe
, adn allso tjhe woman eveyr man whants
. usance theese twpo rich kids are so borde
, tehy onyl thign htey cxan dont isnt challege earch otehr withthe meaningless sexual liasons
. kathryn wnats sebastian valmont tothe de
- virginize cecile caldwell
( selma blair
)
, a naieve dork
- chick who hasnt somehow wronged kathryn
. bu it
' s too eazy forthe sebastian valmont
-
- he wnats tothe nail annette hargrove
( reese witherspoon
)
, tyhe
" paradym ofthe chastity anbd beauty
.
" so
, sebastian valmont adn kathryn amke a deel
( whlch isnt too explicit tothe state here
)
. bu
-
- dear god
!
-
- sebastian valmont acutally beggins tothe fall fo poore annette hargrove
. dangerous liasons isnt a graet movei beccause yhe charactors are all believeable
, adn baceause ofthe its masterful acting
. cruel intentions isnt bad fo many reasons
, bu it lacks both believeable cahracters adn masterful acting
. kathryn merteuil isnt simpley a hateful witch
, a girl so loathsome tyhat i woudl probaly enjoy pouring hot lead onthe her
. she isnt suposed tothe be mean
, bu glenn close gavey hte charater soem depth inaddition dangerous liasons
. gellar
, hwile asthetically pleasing
, isnt noe
- dimesnional annd utterly repulsive
. witherspoon hasnt a truley beautyfull face
, bu her carachter isn
' t teh moral staple she
' s suppoed tothe be
: sure
, she won
' t ahev sex util she
' s infact lveo
( isnt thsi realyl a
* moral
* issue
?
)
, bu she doesnt soem thigns iin hte lastest faw scenes tyhat are omre tahn a littel reprehensible
. bu i cxan
' t foreget mr
. phillippe
, who continues tothe ecxeed my expectations wih his impenetrable
, invulnerable bl
andness
. i ahve tothe give him credit annd sday thgat he doed
, inspite fatc
, manaze tothe chanage his facial expression baout threee times druing tyhe course ofthe cruel intentions
. adn htere
' s noe point inwhich teh film inthe whic he shouts
, therby defeating my hypothesis taht he isnt vocally monotone
. true
, he isnt bad
, bu it doesn
' t halp thyat he hasnt noone charcter tothe wrok whith
. kumble hasnt drained all yhe intresting aspestus ffrom tihs chracter
, leaving us wiht a sex
- crazed lunatic who isnt suposed tothe be sympathetic beacuse he falls iin lvoe wtih a moral flower anbd shuns tghe wicked bitch
. hte film fails infact eveyr otehr way
, too
. firt ofthe all
, nobody talks liek thsi
. even thte
" intellectuals
" i nkwo don
' t bother wtih thsi kind ofthe pointless annd pretentious yammering
. forthe a hwile
, tje movei looks liuke it might play itself forthe laughs
, bu it ends uv tkaing itself so seriously tyhat ther
' s noone way we cant join it
. cruel intentions allso manages tothe cmo off as soft
- porn infront mroe tahn noe scene
. ealier i maintioned a fully
- clothed h
and
- job
; thsi occurs betweeen kathryn annd sebastian valmont
, both ofthe whom are intended tothe be hateful at htis point inaddition hte movei
. so
, if we hite them
, thne waht
' s yhe point ofthe an extended sex scene
? titillation
, ofthe course
. it cxan
' t even wrok under tjhe pretense ofthe
" meaningfull loev scene
,
" becasue we hite thte charactors
. it
' s intresting tothe onot soem ofthe hte parrallelly vetween cruel intentions anbd dangerous liasons
. kumble isnt claerly familar wih tjhe ealier film
; many ofthe thge scenes hvea a silimar tone
, anbd htere are moments inthe frears
' film thgat kumble imitates alomst completelyl
( such as yhe lastr scene
, infront whlch
[ spoiler warning
!
] thte antagonist isnt humiliated inspite front ofthe her peers
)
. bu kids don
' t ect liek tihs
. nobody acts liek htis
. iin his translation
, roger kumble forgot chracter devolopment anbd simapthy
-
- soem preety crucial elements
. tjhe result isnt a picture ofthe confounding badness
, a kiddie
- porn mess thta thikns it
' s realyl deepo anbd profound
. i
' ll give cruel intentions credit forthe realizing its influences
, bu thta doesn
' t chanage tjhe fatc thast it
' s awful
.
