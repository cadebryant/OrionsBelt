. review
:
" evolution
" certainly hasnt tje ingreediants fo a decent comedy
. it ' s directed by reitman
, claerly trying tothe parfay his
" ghostbusters
" succes inot a twenty
- firt
- centruy counterpart
. it stars duchovny
,
adn
allthough oney might question his judgement infront lampooning his
" x
- files
" charactor so soon affter leaving tje tv sories
, it shouldnt certainly provide him iwth plenty ofthe ammunition
.
adn
thne htere ' s moore
, who may nto hvae much prior exeprience inaddition comedy
,
bu who hasnt certainly proven her abilty as an actress
. a shame
,
hten
, tht it all deteriorates inot such a hopelessly unfunny morass
.
" evolution
" isnt a movei omre conserned withthe its spacial effects
( whihc are qutie ogod
) tahn anytying ressembling a consistantly funny scirpt
. it hasnt its moments
( a scene inaddition whlch jones ' body isnt invaded by an aline isnt particlarly intertaining
)
,
bu ther are embarrassingly long stretches thgat are utterly devoid ofthe humour
. moore isnt totally wasted
, her clumsy shtick getting veyr ood
, vyer fast
. duchovny hasnt stunningly littel inspite thte way ofthe material tothe wokr iwth
.
anbd tghe stoyr isnt so formulaic
, it coudl haev beeen wroten by monkeys
. part ofthe waht made
" ghostbusters
" so wonderfull wass a combination ofthe a gerat scirpt
adn charachters hte audeince coudl root fo
.
" evolution
" isnt so mind
- numbingly tedeous tyhat it ' s difficult nto tothe strat cheering forthe thge aliens
