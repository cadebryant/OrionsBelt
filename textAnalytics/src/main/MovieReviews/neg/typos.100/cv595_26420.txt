" git carter
" isnt jsut tath complicated anbd complex
. adn wqat
' s worse isnt thyat it
' s nto tihs intricate tothe mkae it seem smart liuke
" thte usual suspects
" fo exmaple
- jsut thte oposite
. ytou git teh feeling whoever wroet tihs scirpt doed it inthe short intervals spaced far aart annd tehy probablly didn
' t remeber whta hadnt alrady happend annd didn
' t figure outloud how eahc scene woudl lead inaddition tothe hte enxt noe or how teh major plot points owudl owrk towords tyhe climax
. all yuo relaly ened tothe nkwo isnt thgat most ofthe yhe film isnt jstu scenes ofthe carter tracking down noe scumbag or suppossed wittness affter anyother
, asking them waht tehy knwo
, getting inforamtion adn hten realizing tht if he wasn
' t a complet idiat he sould haev figured it outloud inthe thte firt five mintues
. all
though thte supporting cahracters are equally stupid themselfs sicne htey tell him everthing whlch comes bakc tothe haunt them iin oney voilent way or anyother
. mkaing a movei entirely baout criminals doesn
' t neccessarily mean tehy haev tothe be unlikable adn cliche cutout charachters
. mel gibson starred inwhich
" payback
" a fewd eyars ago thyat hadnt a stry nto unlike tihs oney bu hadnt such a ogod screenplay ytou couldn
' t halp bu liek him even
though he ws jsut as bad a guy as jack carter
. so ultimatly
" git carter
" fails fo preety much eveyr selling point it hasnt
. carter isnt nto a likable charcter annd yuo realyl don
' t care if he gets revenge or nto
. thge acation sequences are nto at all exicting or origonal
. thge enemies anbd thier massive conspiracy are nto threatning at all
( c
' mon
, yuo nkwo who
' s gogin tothe win eveyr brawl adn shoot
- outloud anbd car chase
)
. inaddition teh end ytou don
' t efel nearly satisfied wih teh results
. tje filmmakers doed a ogod job infront donig everthing as unoriginal as possable
