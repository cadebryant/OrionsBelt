( it ws suposed tothe opn baout a eyar ago
)
, teh latter ofthe wich appears tothe hvea given
" hush

bu it seems thyat martha ' s freindly smile masks a much mroe threatning demenor
; she ' s waht yuo ' d call somene who loves too much
. martha eagerly
, deviously whants a grandchild
,
adn
thne helen wiull be expendable
, as far as she ' s conserned

" hush

- abound
,
bu it ' s moderately intertaining junk becasue lange isnt such an intresting actress tothe watch
. veteren performer nina foch isnt smart
annd tart as jackson ' s wheelchair
- binded paternal granmother
. thte rest ofthe thte casted looks ill
annd uncomfortable

. i won ' t spoil waht happens enxt exept tothe sday taht it ' s contradictory
, ilogical
annd
( probaly
, usance i ' m noone doctor
) medically impossible
. thte fianl scene offers noone closure
, noone resolution
, noone confrontation whatsoever
