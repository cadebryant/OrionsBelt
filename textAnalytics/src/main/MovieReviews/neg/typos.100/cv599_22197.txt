tghe onyl twpo realyl ogod thigsn thyat i cant sday baout tarzan adn hte lost city are as follows
: jane march wass veyr cute as jane
, adn tje movei wass thankfully under 90 mintues inaddition lenght
. if yuo haven
' t alreday figured it outloud
, i didn
' t liek thsi movei veyr much
. tghe plot wass boring annd contrived tothe thte extreme
. tarzan
( casper van dien
) hasnt nowe left thge jungle annd living infront civilized society
. he isnt jsut dyas awya fomr his impending marrige tothe jane
, palyed by thge aptly named jane march
. bcak infact his fromer hmeo ofthe africa
, a gropu ofthe looters hasnt foudn tje key tothe locating a lost city
.
( mind yuo i never realy figured outloud why htey atcually wnated tothe fidn htis city
.
) anyway
, tarzan
' s ood jungle freind appears tothe him inthe a vision
. tarzan realizes tyhat he must return tothe africa tothe halp stpo thte bad guys ffrom finding teh lost city
. he leaves jane
( his frist misteek
, inspite my oppinion
) annd travels tothe africa
. ofthe course
, jane isnt hot onthe her ape man
' s heals
. yhe twpo ofthe them are reunited inaddition africa where htey dont battle wih tghe bad guys
. soudn liek a dumb explaination ofthe hte plot
? it
' s accually an improvment over yhe rela hting
. tyhe acting isnt jstu plain awful
. i
' m nto qutie sure wqat casper van dien wass doign inspite tihs film
, bu it wasn
' t acting
. jane march wasn
' t a heck ofthe a lot better
, bu at least she isnt eazy onthe tje eyes
. compounding hte bad acting ws thge fatc thast infront many places thge dialogue hadnt obviously beeen re
- recoreded
, anbd i
' ve seen better dubbing inthe soem ood bruce lee movies
. added tothe tghe soudn problems ws tghe cinematography
. htis film ws filled witht beatiful african scenery
. bu yhe panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed tothe me
. qutie frankly
, i htikn yuo coudl probablly dont a better job capturing tyhe beauty ofthe africa whith a camcorder tahn thsi bunch doed wtih proffesional film equiment
. thn we hve tje speical effects
.
" speical effects iin a tarzan movei
?
" ytou are noone dout asking youself
? yes firends
, yhe writers injected smoe vrey outloud ofthe palce supernatural elements inot thte stoyr
. propably fo tjhe sake ofthe useing cgi
, usance it doed nothing bu hurt teh sotry
. inaddition most parts
, htey weren
' t bad
, jsut nothing speshal
. bu
, tehy weere mroe tahn a littel onthe tyhe hokey side
. exept ofthe course
, wehn we got tothe tjhe rediculous climax ofthe tihs movei
. hte gr
and finale
' s spacial effects whent right inot teh toilet at thyat point
. it alomst looked liuke tehy hadnt run outloud ofthe monye
. theese effects weere ofthe noticably lower qualiy thna thsoe inwhich teh rest ofthe thge film annd looked liuke something inthe an aamteur video prodcution
. i tookover oney lesson awya ffrom watching tarzan anbd yhe lost city
-
- ape men anbd bones tath morph inot skeletal warrriors don
' t mix
. stay far awya ffrom htis verzion ofthe tarzan
