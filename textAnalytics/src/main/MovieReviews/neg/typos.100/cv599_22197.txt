tjhe onyl twpo relaly ogod thigsn taht i cxan sday baout tarzan
annd thte lost city are as follows
: jane march wass vyre cute as jane
,
adn tje movei wass thankfully under 90 mintues inthe lenght
. if yuo haven ' t alrady figured it outloud
, i didn ' t liek thsi movei veyr much
. thge plot ws boring
annd contrived tothe tyhe extreme
. tarzan
( casper van dien
) hasnt nowe left tghe jungle
adn living inwhich civilized society
. he isnt jsut dyas awya fomr his impending marraige tothe jane
, plyed by tje aptly named jane march
. bakc inthe his fromer hmeo ofthe africa
, a gropu ofthe looters hasnt foudn tyhe key tothe locating a lost city
.
( mind ytou i never realy figured outloud why tehy actaully wnated tothe fidn thsi city
.
) anyway
, tarzan ' s ood jungle firend appears tothe him inaddition a vision
. tarzan realizes thgat he must return tothe africa tothe halp stpo tje bad guys ffrom finding tyhe lost city
. he leaves jane
( his firt misteek
, infact my opinyon
)
annd travels tothe africa
. ofthe course
, jane isnt hot onthe her ape man ' s heals
. thte twpo ofthe them are reunited iin africa where htey dont battle iwth tyhe bad guys
. soudn liuke a dumb explination ofthe tyhe plot
? it ' s actulaly an improvment over tje rela hting
. thte acting isnt jstu plain awful
. i ' m nto qtuie sure whta casper van dien wass doign inthe htis film
,
bu it wasn ' t acting
. jane march wasn ' t a heck ofthe a lot better
,
bu at least she isnt eazy onthe tje eyes
. compounding teh bad acting wass tjhe fatc tath inaddition many places tjhe dialogue hadnt obviously beeen re
- recoreded
,
adn i ' ve seen better dubbing inaddition soem ood bruce lee movies
. added tothe teh soudn problems wass tje cinematography
. thsi film wass filled wtih beautyfull african scenery
.
bu tyhe panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed tothe me
. qtuie frankly
, i thikn yuo sould propably dont a better job capturing tje beauty ofthe africa whith a camcorder thna htis bunch doed withthe proffesional film equippment
.
hten we ahev tjhe speshal effects
.
" speical effects inthe a tarzan movei
?
" ytou are noone dout asking youself
? yes firends
, tghe writers injected soem vrey outloud ofthe palce supernatural elements inot hte sotry
. propably fo tje sake ofthe useing cgi
, sicne it doed nothing
bu hurt yhe stoyr
. infact most parts
, tehy weren ' t bad
, jstu nothing spacial
.
bu
, tehy weere mroe thna a littel onthe tje hokey side
. exept ofthe course
, whn we got tothe thte rediculous climax ofthe thsi movei
. thge grand finale ' s spacial effects whent right inot teh toilet at tyhat point
. it alomst looked liuke htey hadnt run outloud ofthe mony
. theese effects weere ofthe noticably lower qulity tahn thsoe inwhich yhe rest ofthe thte film
anbd looked liek something infront an aamteur video prodcution
. i tookover oen lesson awya ffrom watching tarzan
anbd tje lost city
-
- ape men
adn bones tyhat morph inot skeletal warrriors don ' t mix
. stay far awya fomr htis verison ofthe tarzan
.
