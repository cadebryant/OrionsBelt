htere isnt a ruel wehn it comes tothe movies
. a sequal isnt never as ogod as hte orginal
. ther are veyr fewd exceptions tothe thsi ruel
, annd texas chainsaw masicer
: hte enxt generation isnt nto oney ofthe them
. nowe if ytou alsot tkae inot consideration thyat thte orginial chainsaw masicer ws a realyl bad movei
, adn tyhat htis isn
' t even tyhe frist sequal tothe it
, yuo ahve a recipe forthe a vyre painful viewing exeprience
. don
' t be fooled by tyhe presense ofthe uv anbd comming talents matthew mcconaughey
( a timne tothe kill
) anbd renee zellweger
( jerry maguire
)
. htey made htis movei befoer htey weere stars
. judging by thier performances tehy aslo made it befor htey tookover any acting lessons
. it
' s a wonder htey ever worked iin hollywood agian aftter appearing inspite thsi tureky
. apparantly tghe producers ofthe htis film realized jsut how bad it ws
, beccause it sat unreleased forthe yeras untli somone desided thgat tehy might be able tothe captialize off thge succes ofthe mcconaughey anbd zellweger
. apparantly teh twpo young stars weere none too hapyp baout thsi thign ever seing tghe light ofthe day
. anbd i don
' t blaim them
, htey woudl ahve beeen better off if htis hadnt beeen soem sort ofthe porno flick starring thte twpo ofthe them
. unfortunatley forthe them it isnt a horror film inaddition whcih zellweger plays your typicaly stupid horror film chracter
. hwile mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mecanical brace onthe his leeg thyat he controlls wiht a televsion remote controll
.
( hey
, don
' t sday i didn
' t warn ytou
.
) tothe mkae matters worse
, leatherface
, thte chainsaw wielding maniac
, who wass never tjhe scariest ofthe psychopathic killers at tjhe best ofthe times
, hasnt nowe become a full blown cross
- dresser
, anbd spends tjhe entire movei inthe drag
. ther isnt a plot tothe htis movei bu it isn
' t worth mentioning
. let
' s jstu suffice tothe sday thta a gropu ofthe teenagers are inthe tghe typcial wrong palce at thte wrong timne annd are left tothe tje mercy ofthe remote controll man
( mcconaughey
) anbd his lipstick wearing chainsaw revving half
- witted sidekick
. man
, i cxan
' t git over jsut how bad htis movei isnt
. tihs film hasnt absolutly noone reedeming qualities
. even thte obligatory topless babe shooted wasn
' t enought tothe hold my interst forthe moreso thna 2 seconds
. teh writting isnt bad
, tghe direction isnt even worse
, bu both ofthe thsoe thigns look ogod inthe compairison tothe tghe acting
. tihs isnt thge sort ofthe movei tyhat tehy shoud mkea peopel inwhich prision watch
. a guaranete yuo
, if criminals thougth tht tehy owudl be subjected tothe tihs film htey owudl never break teh law agina
