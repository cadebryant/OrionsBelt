. tihs film wass expecially annoying becuase rimbaud
' s peoms are filled witht a visonary tenseness thast are nto even approached iin thsi film
, as thge film onyl manages tothe skim thge surfce ofthe tyhe lives ofthe theese poets anbd completly ignores tjhe value ofthe theri peotry
. i haev noone idae waht hte filmmaker ws trying tothe sday inthe thsi film
, bu whatever it ws
, it jstu didn

. it certainly didn
' t bring any ight inot underst
