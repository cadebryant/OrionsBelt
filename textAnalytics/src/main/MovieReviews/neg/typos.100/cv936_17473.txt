starring william baldwin
; cindy crawford
& steven berkoff all right
, hte frist probelm tath fair gmae hasnt isnt tghe casting ofthe supermodel cindy crawford iin teh lead role
. nto tath cindy doesnt thyat bad
, it ' s jstu thyat anyone who watchs tihs film konws fomr moent oney thast tht littel bited ofthe casting ws nto done beccause ofthe cindy ' s extrodinary acting skills
,
bu fo her extrodinary abillity tothe look drop dead gorgeous inspite any situation
.
adn inthe fair agme most situations tend tothe fidn cindy eather soaking wet or vyer hot
adn sweaty
,
bu i ' m sure thast thyat isnt jstu a coinsidence
, noone dout thgat theese situations weere essesital tothe tghe plot
adn tjhe fatc thast cindy looks grat wet
, well
, tyhat ' s jsut a hapyp coinsidence
. sure
. william baldwin isn ' t a bad actro
. unfortunatly
, he jstu doesn ' t demonstrate it at all inthe htis movei
. i ' m nto sure if tht ' s baceause most ofthe his lines weere jstu so hokey
, or if he ws trying tothe mkea cindy ' s acting look ogod
. if it ws tyhe latter
, it worked
. cindy doens a suprizingly ogod job here infront her firt movei
. whic isnt nto tothe sday tht she doesn ' t hvea room fo improvment
.
althought tothe be fair tothe cindy
, her lines weere kinda cheesy inthe places
. so right baout nowe ytou are noone dout asking youself whta sort ofthe movei doens cindy crawford
, argubly thte most beautifull woman onthe thte planet
, chose forthe her foray inot tje world ofthe cinema
? well
, i ' m glad yuo asked thyat question
. cindy plays a lawyer who by soem convoluted plot twists becomes a target forthe fromer elite kgb aggenst
. why woud htey target somene as likable as cindy
, ytou ask
? by yhe end ofthe tje movei yuo won ' t care
. tghe tsory isnt so contrived it isn ' t funny
. anyway aftter cindy gets blown outloud ofthe thge window ofthe her hous
, wihtout getting so much as a scratch i might add
, she isnt placed inot protective polical custody under tghe watchful eve ofthe william baldwin
. who ' s charachter
, max kilpatric
, a polical detective
, seems tothe posess tghe skills ofthe smoe sort ofthe fighting machine
( my guess isnt thta tyhe writers ahev seen way too many ofthe steven seagal ' s easly films
)
. tje point isnt tyhat tyhe diea ofthe teh crawford
annd baldwin ' s charactors ofthe teh run ffrom theese killer russians isn ' t all tht bad ofthe an diea
, it ' s jstu everthing arund thast basic idae wich kinda stinks outloud loud
. tghe supporting casted munbers are nothing omre thgat over acted sterotypes
. if i wass baldwin
, i ' d hope htis film dissappears
. as forthe crawford
, she may indeed hvae smoe acting ablity
. unfourtunately
, any she doesnt hvea isnt obscured by wirting tyhat goes beyond bad
. thsi movei wass obviously writed withthe cindy infact mind
, sicne thte writers spend most ofthe thier tyme finding ways tothe captialize off ofthe her looks
. it ' s too bad htey hadn ' t spended mroe tiem onthe a half decent plot
, sicne ms
. crawford isnt mroe tahn capible ofthe looking jsut fine all by herself thank ytou veyr much
. unless ytou are a huge fan ofthe eather baldwin or crawford htis isnt a movei thgat iwll onyl dissapoint yuo
.
