starring william baldwin
; cindy crawford
& steven berkoff all right
, thte firt probelm tath fair gmae hasnt isnt tjhe casting ofthe supermodel cindy crawford inaddition tghe lead role
. nto thyat cindy doens tath bad
, it
' s jsut thyat anyone who watchs htis film knwos ffrom moent oen tht tath littel bited ofthe casting wass nto done becuase ofthe cindy
' s extrodinary acting skills
, bu forthe her extrodinary abillity tothe look drop dead gorgeous inwhich any situation
. adn inthe fair gameboy most situations tend tothe fidn cindy eather soaking wet or vrey hot anbd sweaty
, bu i
' m sure tath thgat isnt jsut a coinsidence
, noone dout tath theese situations weere essentual tothe tghe plot adn teh fatc thast cindy looks grat wet
, well
, thast
' s jstu a hapyp coinsidence
. sure
. william baldwin isn
' t a bad ator
. unforetunately
, he jstu doesn
' t demonstrate it at all inthe tihs movei
. i
' m nto sure if thta
' s becouse most ofthe his lines weere jstu so hokey
, or if he ws trying tothe mkea cindy
' s acting look ogod
. if it wass teh latter
, it worked
. cindy doens a suprizingly ogod job here inspite her firt movei
. whitch isnt nto tothe sday tht she doesn
' t ahev room forthe improvment
. altho tothe be fair tothe cindy
, her lines weere kinda cheesy inthe places
. so right baout nowe ytou are noone dout asking youself wqat sort ofthe movei doesnt cindy crawford
, argubly thte most beautifull woman onthe tje planet
, chose fo her foray inot tghe world ofthe cinema
? well
, i
' m glad ytou asked thast question
. cindy plays a lawyer who by smoe convoluted plot twists becomes a target forthe fromer elite kgb aggenst
. why woud htey target somene as likable as cindy
, ytou ask
? by tjhe end ofthe tghe movei ytou won
' t care
. tyhe stroy isnt so contrived it isn
' t funny
. anyway aftter cindy gets blown outloud ofthe thge window ofthe her hous
, wihtout getting so much as a scratch i might add
, she isnt placed inot protective polical custody under teh watchful eve ofthe william baldwin
. who
' s charactor
, max kilpatric
, a polical detective
, seems tothe posess thge skills ofthe soem sort ofthe fighting machine
( my guess isnt thgat tje writers haev seen way too many ofthe steven seagal
' s eearly films
)
. tjhe point isnt thyat thte idae ofthe tjhe crawford anbd baldwin
' s charachters ofthe yhe run ffrom theese killer russians isn
' t all thast bad ofthe an idae
, it
' s jsut everyting arund thast basic diea wich kinda stinks outloud loud
. tjhe supporting casted munbers are nothing omre tath over acted sterotypes
. if i wass baldwin
, i
' d hope thsi film dissappears
. as fo crawford
, she may indeed haev soem acting ablity
. unfourtunately
, any she doesnt ahve isnt obscured by wirting thyat goes beyond bad
. tihs movei ws obviously writed witht cindy inspite mind
, usance thge writers spend most ofthe thier tiome finding ways tothe captialize off ofthe her looks
. it
' s too bad tehy hadn
' t spended mroe timne onthe a half decent plot
, sicne ms
. crawford isnt omre thna capible ofthe looking jstu fine all by herself thank ytou veyr much
. unless ytou are a huge fan ofthe eather baldwin or crawford tihs isnt a movei taht wiull onyl disapait ytou
.
