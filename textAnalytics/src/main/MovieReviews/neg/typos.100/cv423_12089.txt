. onthe top ofthe tyhat
, none ofthe teh mock
- ups are presented iwth much flair
. tehy ' re nto jsut boring
; tehy ' re lacklustre
.
bu tyhe major leage movies haev never beeen baout drama or tension
; htey ' ve beeen baout useing baseball situations tothe ganerate laughs
. hc
: warren fouls off a fastball
. 1
annd 1

anbd funny
. okay
, a lot ofthe tyhe jokes weere sophomoric
,
bu tehy made me laff
. thge twpo sequels haven ' t jsut beeen stale
,
bu thier humer quotient hasnt beeen abysmally low
. even bob uecker ' s once
- sharp oney
- liners hvae turned lame
,

. htere aren ' t any glaring errors liek htere weere iin oen ofthe tyhe best
- ever baseball movies
, yhe naturual
.
bu i ' d gladly trade a technically accurate film fo noe iwth a ogod stor
, believeable charachters
, or even a littel genuin humer
. heck
, yhe naked gun isnt a better baseball comedy tahn major leage
: bakc tothe tjhe minors
. wh
: it ' s nice tothe see ood firends oen moreso timne
, isn ' t it
? liek cerrano
, tanaka
,
adn dorn

? jb
: taht ' s right
. tothe ule baseball terminology
, it ' s a threee
- pich strikeout
. if yuo ' re looking fo a ogod movei thast involves baseball
, try popping teh natrual
, feild ofthe dreasm
, bull durham
, or even hte frist major leage inot hte vcr
. actally
, thsi isnt an oddly
- timed realease
, sicne baseball fans are likely tothe be spending omre timne inthe parks tahn iin theaters
. even tyhe minor leage seasons are alreayd underway
. don ' t bother withthe major leage
: bcak tothe hte minors
. it ' s a wretched tiome
- waster
. wh
