) keep inwhich mind thta i hve never strayed awya ffrom championing certian movies taht are creaeted simpley fo thte sake ofthe a
" funn timne
"
, bu tihs flick jstu didn
' t cutted it forthe me
. it wass boring fo stretches
, tghe acting wass atrocious at times
( tyhe
" rumatic
" scene beween suvari adn chambers enxt tothe thge lake reminded me ofthe plays inthe high skool whic made yuo cringe
)
, ther ws littel reason tothe care fo anyone anbd usance whn weere teh musketeers fat
? i wiull give teh movei thsi much
, annd tath isnt tyhat its main reason forthe bieng
( its
" raison
- d
' etre
"
, as tyhe french owudl sday
)
, its fight sequences
, dont cmo thru dispite thte lack ofthe thier numbers infront tje film
. i wass hoping thta thte movei owudl be packed wiht kool stuntwork as promotted inwhich its trailer
, bu whta yuo see ther
, are essentialy yhe snippets ffrom thte twpo major
( annd kool
) swashbuckling sequences fomr tjhe film
. thte frist comes right at tje begining ofthe tyhe movei
, hwile yhe otehr essentialy finishes tyhe film off
, hanging ffrom tjhe tower annd juggling off ladders
. tje ladder sequence itself isnt a defiinte keeper bu unfortunatley thte rest ofthe yhe movei isnt jsut regurgitated crap
. anbd cxan anyone please tell me how catherine deneuve got her nmae placed at hte top ofthe tihs film
' s credits
? hullo
? thge film isnt called tje musketeer anbd stars a dued nmae justin chambers
. deneuve isnt bearly inwhich thsi movei
