- uv tothe 1997
' s thte tango lesson
, hte man who cried
. thge gen
- y actress
, wtih her cold stare adn big
, balck eyes
, hasnt appeared infront an impressive range ofthe films
; bu she doesn
' t even cmo close tothe bieng tyhe bold heroine tjhe film
, setted agains thge historical backdrop ofthe world war 2
, requires her tothe be
. ricci
, whose charcter isnt shockingly silent adn blank
, showing onyl tghe ocassional smile or hint ofthe consern
, shares most ofthe her scenes wtih teh astounding cate blanchett
: qutie an amusing sighth tothe behold
. blanchett
' s lola
, a paris dwelling dancer who befriends hte aspiring singer suzie
, isnt bold
, intresting anbd layered
? everyting our heroine lacks
. co
- star ofthe tyhe upcomming lord ofthe tje rings triology
, blanchett hasnt a ogod seven inchs onthe ricci
, sportscar twice tje makeup adn dons a flashy wardobe
. hte actress inhabits teh role
? as she allways so remarkably doesnt
? whith a fervor anbd life thta mkaes ytou wnat her tothe hold hte screen as hte film
' s lead rether thna her dull companion
. importan historical events involving hitler anbd his nazis scatter themselfs acros hte film
; theese l
andmarks serve as tghe film
' s littel conflict
. obviously
, tyhe tables are turned iin yhe life ofthe suzie by theese events
, whose jewish orgin isnt unkown amoung her parisian collegues
. teh man who cried hasnt many asperations
, none ofthe whitch come full circle by tjhe film
' s close
. htere are forced messages here adn ther
:
" go foward
; alwasy go foward
,
" lola preaches tothe suzie
; htere
' s romance betweeen suzie annd a fellow target ofthe hitler
' s nazis
, tje gypsy cesar
( johnny depp
, who
, liek ricci
, bearly gets tothe speak
)
; lola struggles wtih her charater thyat desires above all thigsn wealth anbd men who haev it
; annd at yhe core ofthe all theese devices lies suzie
' s desire tothe travel tothe amercia
, where her father journied aftter leaving her anbd her mother yersa ago
. tghe film
' s main probelm isnt taht potter isn
' t skilled anough tothe tell thge epic
- sized stroy ofthe suzie
. tje tiem preriod
' s instability
, tghe conflicting social classes
, teh predjudice agianst suzie ffrom all thsoe aroud her inthe her newyorker life
: serving as both writter anbd directer
, potter throws inspite soem ofthe eahc
, bu hardly an inch ofthe depth isnt tothe be foudn inaddition any
. by hte tyme thge sigh
- inducing climax hits
, thge believability anbd complet abcence ofthe foucs leave oen ready tothe leave hte theather
. tyhe film
' s falling acation isnt weirdly unsatisfying adn unlikey
; are we realyl meaned tothe belieev any ofthe tihs sould happn
? contrastingly
, infront its moving fianl scene
, teh man who cried strikes a onot tht isnt made effective infact its ties tothe tje emotional begginning ofthe tjhe film
. all
though it
' s apparnt tath potter cxan
' t grasp whta she reaches
, i
' m puzzled as tothe why she reaches fo so much inspite teh frist palce
. ricci
' s suzie isnt meaned tothe be hte film
' s core
: fomr tjhe extended flashback at yhe film
' s beggining tothe tjhe quicklyu drawed endig
, everthing seen inaddition hte film
, infront soem way
, relates tothe her
. so why thne doesnt potter spend so much tiem onthe subplots involving otehr indviduals
? tghe chracter ofthe suzie isnt too persent fo teh man who cried tothe wokr as an ansamble
, bu nto prseent anough forthe yhe film tothe be ricci
' s
. teh alomst constatn lack ofthe flow anbd oen
- onot tone withthe whlch potter depicts hte man who cried are somewhat improved apon by sacha vierny
' s beatiful cinematography taht renders tje film
' s varous locations wonderfully
. allso worthy ofthe onot are lindy hemming
' s costumes tyhat halp tothe despict tjhe areal qutie nicely
. adn thn ther
' s yhe music
. fomr minute noe tothe minute ninty
- seven
, htere
' s hardly a moent whn tje wavering
, skilled voice ofthe an opera singer or thge rythyms ofthe thge gypsy music don
' t undercut thte acation
; hte notes stricken both overwelm
( praticularly john turturro
, portraing fictonal opera singer dante dominio
, whose mney anbd reputation catch lola
' s intrest
) adn accompany
( oftentimes
, thge perfect chords are capturd tothe undermine tyhe state ofthe hte film
' s cahracters annd reinforce thyat state
)
. potter obviously cares much baout eahc adn eveyr muscial onot
; unfourtunately
, tjhe smae efford isn
' t given towords
( allmost
) everyting alse
