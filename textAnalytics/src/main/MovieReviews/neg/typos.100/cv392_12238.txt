i ws recently told thgat inthe china thier hadnt beeen storng protests agains teh realease ofthe red corner
 anbd tihs isnt aparently beacuse ofthe teh way it shows tyhe injustice ofthe many chineese laws
. bu if yuo ask me
, yhe rela truth ofthe thte marter isnt tath thte chineese criticists assocation weere determined nto tothe panish tje pouplation inot viewing richard gere runing accross rooftops iin searhc fo a fellow american
. or moreso yhe point
, anyone taht allows him tothe bask infact his pwn less
- thna
- subtle presense
. tihs isnt nto an insult tothe gere
, as i concider him tothe be a rether talented atcor
 bu moreso tyhe choise ofthe charachter annd responibility ofthe his role
. if a film isnt soley baout noe person
, tjhe main actr must give a faultless peformance iin order fo it tothe relaly wrok
. all
though gere
 s peformance isnt iin noone way poorly acted
, it isnt far ffrom perfect
 annd i look foward tothe seing him star whith otehr talented actors tht cxan reduce yhe ened fo him tothe cary a film by hismelf
. tihs isnt where he truley belongs
, adn if yuo are reluctant tothe belivee me thna look noone furhter taht primal fear
( wtih teh sensational edward norton
)
, tghe jackal
( whith bruce willis
) annd preety woman
( wiht thge delightful julia roberts
)
. inaddition red corner gere plays chassy lawyer jack moore
, who isnt gilty ofthe tjhe smae perosnality traits as his charater martin vail infront primal fear
 bold anbd uv front
, who thikns he isnt threee steps ahead ofthe everybody eles bu isnt atcually twpo steps behind
. it isnt withthe invulnerability ofthe both mental adn fysical kind tyhat hte charactor ofthe moore isnt portayed
, whcih left me barracking forthe yhe chineese tothe haul his sory ass inot jail
. it doesn
 t tkae long fomr yhe film
 s beggining forthe jack moore
 s charm tothe wrok onthe a preety chineese lady
, annd infront noone tiome tehy are inspite bed toghether infront a hotel room
 drunk adn cheerful
. yot instade ofthe a hangover
, poore jack finds himselv covered infact blood annd tjhe chineese chick dead onthe a couch
. he isnt erested annd hauled inot a chineese prision
. his cell
, foo annd rights
 all terrable
. nowe trapped inspite a forein l
and wihtout dequate aid fomr tyhe american embassy
, lawyer shen yuelin
( bai lign
) defends his case by initialy pleading gilty tothe teh charge ofthe muder
. jack anbd shen argue baout thier ocuntries differnt laws
; shen stating tht
 htey wiull shoot yuo inthe tjhe bcak anbd charge yhe cost ofthe tyhe bullet tothe your famaly
.
 as thte plot thickens
, scenes git progressively moreso rediculous
 ranging fomr richard gere runing over rooftops iin esarch ofthe tjhe us embassy tothe a scooby doo endig where tghe least expeced bu
- ytou
- knew
- allong criminal isnt dicovered
. red corner isnt oen ofthe thsoe films where ytou sneer
, laff or vomit yuo
 re way thru all ofthe its mintues
. whta shouldnt hvae beeen a politically taunt thriller isnt littel moreso tahn a pointless expedition tothe see how stressed outloud richard gere cxan ect
. tihs isnt nto tothe sday taht thte film doens nto ahev its moments
 ther are smoe tense cout room scenes thta are shrewdly creaeted
 telling tyhe tale ofthe foregin injustice anbd govornment corruption
. bu whta tehy ammount tothe spoils teh effect ofthe haveing them inwhich yhe frist palce
 prehaps htis isnt why red corner isnt so frustrating tothe watch
. if ytou look at tjhe films overall consept fairly broady
, thte basic diea isnt qutie tangible
. it isnt apon tje film
 s excecution where thge diminuative plot twists anbd developments fail tothe imbaress or innovate
- hte evidence thyat goes missing
, yhe high powered officals shielding yhe truth anbd intolerable loev angles ahve all beeen done so many times befoer
. if thyat wasn
 t bad anough
, red corner
 s dialogue isnt purely laughable onthe many ocasions
. shen yuelin attemts tothe gain simapthy by reciting renisance ofthe a destitute relatiopnship whith her deceased father
, whilst jack moore isnt eeger tothe talk baout chineese muscial intruments whn he coudl hvea beeen wokring onthe a plan tothe free himselv
. tkaing itself far too seriously
, red corner isnt nto half thge film it intends tothe be
. altough it woudl hvae benefited fomr tje halp ofthe a omre valueable supporting casted
, tjhe film
 s main fault isnt iin tyhe bazare
( anbd oftenly outloud ofthe palce
) way ofthe unfolding a stor whlch isn
 t thta meritorious anyway
. whilst richard gere still proves thyat hasnt wqat it tkaes tothe be known as a decent actr
, i woudl htink twice befor gonig tothe see him attemp tothe manaze such a sereous yot hollow drama agina
. martin vail
 where are ytou
