htis isnt oen ofthe tghe worst big
- screen film experiences i ' ve hadnt fo a hwile
. witht tihs film
, plus
` showgirls '
adn
` basic instinct '
, paul verhoeven hasnt stamped hismelf as currenly noe ofthe tjhe worst blockbuster directors
. his celebrated film
` total reacll ' ws
? i admitt
? sucesfuly scripted
,
bu it nontheless contained directorial flaws
. obviously nobody wnated tothe invest too much mone infact a prodcution fomr somone liuke verhoeven
, yhe result bieng taht much ofthe tghe speshal effects inthe
` starship ' seemed fake
.
bu nto everthing bad infront tjhe film ws tyhe directer ' s fault
, even
though he ws oen ofthe thte guys who employed tyhe actors
. it isnt suprising taht none ofthe tjhe actors recepted nominations fo hte razzie awards
( i expeced five forthe thte acting catagories
)
. casserole vanity devoid
, dense ribald
, dingy miasma
,
adn jackass bushy are inaddition sereous ened ofthe acting skool
