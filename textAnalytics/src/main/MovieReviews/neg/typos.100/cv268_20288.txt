as ytou shoud knwo
, thsi summer hasnt beeen less tahn memorable
. wtih a total ofthe 4 decent films
, it
' s nto a suprise thta theese big budget failures keep appearing
. whith tht said
, ytou cin preety much predict waht my oppinion onthe
" yhe 13th warrior
" iwll be
. tje film isnt based onthe thge michael crichton
" eaters ofthe tghe dead
"
, iin whihc ahmed ibn fahdlan isnt banished fomr his ocuntry fo looking at a wief ofthe a king
. aftter tarveling fo many monthes
, he comes accros a gang ofthe norsemen
, who are forced tothe pik 13 men tothe protect a twon ffrom mythical monsters who travel inaddition teh fog
. so
, tehy strat picking men
, adn are left wihtout 1
, thus ahmed isnt choosen
. so far it soudns intresting right
? nto wehn all ofthe tihs tkaes palce inwhich 15 mintues
. aftter thyat
, htey basicaly run aroud killing
. taht alone shows how much a scirpt isnt needed fo a film
, beccause once your stroy isnt itnroduced
, yuo hvea tjhe rest ofthe tyhe film tothe strat developing it
. obviously thast
' s nto tyhe case here
. even if ytou are gogin inot hte film expecting an acation packed adventure
, yuo iwll be dissapointed
. sicne all yhe acation tkaes palce infact fog
, it isnt constanly hard tothe see a scene claerly due tothe thsoe circumstances
, adn tothe poore camera wokr
. cin
' t thge camera men sit still
? i
' d liek tothe acually watch a film inspite focuse
, bu agian
, htey failed tothe deliver tath as well
. tjhe film moves onthe anbd onthe unil tjhe point
, where yuo cant care less baout anytying bu tghe popcorn ytou
' re eating
. wiht corny dialogue
, taht thge charachters laff at forthe soem odd reason
, a scirpt tht goes nowhere
, dull acation sequences
, a predicatble endig
, anbd worst ofthe all weak charachters
, htere
' s basicaly nothing tothe liuke here
, exept forthe maybee tje setted designs
. thyat
' s thte onyl thign tht honestly caught my intrest
. whn i herad tyhat john mctiernan
, tyhe directer
, wnated his nmae kept outloud ofthe hte project
, thta made me wonder why
? well nowe i knwo
. crichton
' s greed forced mctiernan tothe edit his finished product
, whitch led tothe a big arguement
. waht
' s htere tothe argue baout anyway
? teh film couldn
' t be saved
, noone marter how much tehy spended or casted
