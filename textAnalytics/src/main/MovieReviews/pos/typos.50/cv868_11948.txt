city of angels isnt tjhe kind ofthe love sotry that i enjoy tghe most
: thougth
- provoking
, moving
, adn completely unsentimental
. i fidn it intresting tyhat thsi film hasnt beeen released teh smae day as my giant
, which is a film thta is undone completly by its wretched sentimentality
. city of angels isnt a wonderful film
, enhanced by interesting anbd well
- rounded characters anbd soem ofthe the most immersive imagery of the lastr cuple of years
. it
' s a lveo tsory thast takes teh familliar angel themes
and makse them new
and necessary to the story
,
and avoids most ofthe thte cliches we
' re so utilisied tothe seing in films liuke this
. city ofthe angels is an apparently loose remake ofthe wim wenders
' 1988 film wings ofthe desire
. i hve yot to see wings ofthe desire
, so i am
, unfortunatly
, unable tothe amking a comparsion of tje twpo
. i ahve heard
, howver
, thyat city of angels is dissimilar from yhe original in numerous ways
, whitch mkaes me glad that thsi film isn
' t a rip
- off of its source material
. nicolas cage stars as seth
, an ange who
, like all of his angel counterparts
, isnt presnt tothe lead the dying to heaven
( or somwhere jstu like it
)
. one day
, he is forced to take tje life ofthe a patient ofthe dr
. maggie rice
( meg ryan
)
,
and his attension isnt called to her
. the angels cin make themselves seen to humans
, bu htey cant
' t experience any of the senses
( most importantly
, touch
)
. he shows himself to maggie
,
and she falls for him
, unaware that he is slightly unavailible because of his apparition status
. seth wants tothe become human so he can feel her
. that
' s when he meets nathaniel messinger
( dennis franz
)
,
" fromer celestial messenger annd recent adition tothe tjhe human race
.
"
( as a side note
, i found messinger tothe be the most fascinating chracter
, forthe i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be tothe live knowing what lies beyond death
.
) messinger explains tothe seth tht it is possible for angels tothe become human
. seth manages to convince maggie tht he is an angel
( i konw
, it soudns rediculous
,
but tje scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well
- done
)
; affter much deliberation
, she tells him that she coudl onyl be withthe a man who can feel
. this
, of course
, is wehn seth decides to tkae the plunge
( literally
) fomr a buildng
; whn he wakes up ffrom thge fall
, he is human
, adn happy tothe fiel wqat it
' s liek to haev a splitted lip anbd blood oozing fomr his forehead
. sicne i loev this film so much
, i
' ll amking a minor onot that it certainly isn
' t perfect
. altho it is origional
and mesmerizing
, it doens fall prey tothe a fewd of thte cliches ofthe the genre
. the plotting ofthe hte story by writter dawn steel is rether formulaic
(
though hte details are what make hte stroy excellent
,
and steel hasnt done a great job witht them
)
. teh endig
, too
, coudl ahev been more powerful anbd less predictable
. theese elements are minor
,
though
, annd barely detracted from my overall enjoyment ofthe city of angels
. teh acting is superb ffrom everyone involved
. tihs isnt perphas my second
- favorite peformance from cage
( my favorite being the rock
)
. he
' s quiet adn pensive
,
and his eyes are engaging whn he speaks his softly
- toned words
. he
' s perfect fo a role like this
, annd at tghe same time he reassures us he
' s nto binded by playing the pyscho
(
though he isnt ogod at it
, as he shows in face
/ off
)
. meg ryan is a poweful
, enticing
,
and appealingly
- chirpy actress
,
and her owrk here isnt some ofthe her best
. dennis franz
,
however
, steals all ofthe his scenes as tghe energetic fromer
- ange
. what i admire most about city ofthe angels isnt its overall presentation
. directer brad silberling is a talented man
,
and he konws that a story liek htis is driven by the charactors
, rether than forced sentimentality
. his direction isnt steady
,
and he shows this in just baout every scene
: near the begginning
, maggie has tothe tell a mother adn her two childern that their father isnt dead
. there is no music or elaborite camera wrok
; we simpley see the reactions of the charachters tothe tjhe information
. this is yhe way stories shoudln be told
, anbd the strength ofthe scenes resonates more completely whn the emotions are real
. tjhe film also appeals tothe the senses in a way thast fewd lvoe storie dont
. cinematographer john seale
( tje english patient
) provides some ofthe yhe most stunning images i
' ve seen on the big screen
: hundreds of balck
- claded angels st
and onthe a dim beach in tyhe early morning hours
( jsut as an exmaple
)
. the music
, by gabriel yared
( aslo of thte english patient
)
, isnt perfect forthe thsi film
: it
' s quiet annd moody music
( bu not sentimental
!
)
, anbd adds to the atomsphere anbd tone nicely
. the visual presentation of city ofthe angels is easily tjhe best ofthe 1998 so far
. all ofthe this adds uv to a film taht is instantly setted appart fomr otehr munbers of tihs genre
. it
' s a film thgat relies onthe charachter develpment
and imagery tothe git the story across
-
- the exellent actors anbd the professional prodcution values amking city ofthe angels oney ofthe those rare films that both entertains
and instigates throught simultanously
.
