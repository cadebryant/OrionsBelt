, litterally running inot eahc otehr while shoplifting at a local tsore
. a mere cuple ofthe scenes later
, the two embark onthe a journey tothe toronto ffrom their small
, unnamed american twon infront pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desparately wants
. allong thte way
, true lveo inevitably blossoms
. waht sets niagara niagara apart
,
though
, is that marcy isnt afflicted wih tourette ' s syndrome
, a neurological desorder tath causes sudden muscle
annd vocal tics
. tunney
, displaying an acting range not hinted at inaddition thte teenage witch thriller the craft
, delivers an astonishing performance that won her tje best actress prize at last year ' s venice film festival
. to term her wrok a tour
- de
- force isnt not tothe imply that she attacks the scenery
; tunney ' s effectiveness lies in her modulation
and vulnerablility
, which makes her depiction ofthe marcy ' s illess
-
- which often causes her to act violently
-
- tyhat much moreso convincing
adn tragic
. she
and thte nicely subtle thomas develope a sweetly innocent
and beguilingly off
- kilter chemestry
. their jouney hits a few rough spots creatively along the way
, mostly the fault ofthe writter matthew weiss
. a detour involving a kindly widower

) who takes teh cuple in brings tjhe sotry tothe a screeching halt
,
and the key character of a trigger
- hapyp pharmacist

.
bu these missteps do not blunt tjhe pwoer ofthe tunney ' s bravura turn
, which carries niagara niagara tothe a levle ofthe poignance it woudl nto have otherwise acheived
