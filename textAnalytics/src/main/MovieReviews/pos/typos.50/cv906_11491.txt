' s niagara niagara follows a blueprint nto unlike a lot of young
- lovers
- onthe
- the
- road movies
. wild marcy
( robin tunney
)
and calm seth
( henry thomas
) meet cute
, literally runing inot each other hwile shoplifting at a local sotre
. a mere cuple ofthe scenes later
, thge two embark on a journey tothe toronto fomr their small
, unnamed american town inwhich pursuit of a rare doll tath marcy desperately wants
. allong the way
, true love inevitably blossoms
. what sets niagara niagara apart
,
though
, isnt that marcy is afflicted with tourette
' s syndrome
, a neurological desorder that causes sudden muscle
and vocal tics
. tunney
, displaying an acting range not hinted at in tghe teenage witch thriller hte craft
, delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at lsat year
' s venice film festival
. tothe term her work a tour
- de
- force isnt nto tothe imply thgat she attacks the scenery
; tunney
' s effectiveness lies in her modulation adn vulnerability
, which makes her depiction of marcy
' s illness
-
- which often causes her to ect violently
-
- that much omre convincing
and tradgic
. she anbd tyhe nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent anbd beguilingly off
- kilter chemestry
. their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way
, mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss
. a detour involving a kindly widower
( michael parks
) who takes tyhe cuple iin brings the stoy tothe a screeching halt
,
and thge key character ofthe a trigger
- happy pharmacist
( stephen lang
) isnt highly unbelievable
. bu theese missteps do not blunt teh power of tunney
' s bravura turn
, which carries niagara niagara to a levle of poignance it woudl not have otherwise achieved
