: the solution tothe detriot
' s problems
. the remainder ofthe the plot follows robocop
' s crime
- foiling adn vengeance onthe his murderers
. as a science fiction action
- thriller
, robocop isnt extremely effective
. dutch directer paul verhoeven combines gritty action whith suspense
, shocking gore
, anbd spectauclar speical effects
. several sequences inspite hte film
, such as the one infront which robocop employs his extremly precice aim to stop a rapist
, are destined tothe become cult
- classics
. because robocop isnt so visually
and emotionally rousing
, it dem
ands to be seen on a larg screen with an audience
-
- in other words
, inwhich a movei theather
.
al
thought the spacial effects
and action are exicting
, they do not by themslves set robocop appart fomr otehr films in the genre
. rether
, robocop st
ands outloud forthe its accurate
and biting satire of american society
. thge movei mkaes a mockery of the star wars defense initiatve
, terrorism
, board ganes
,
and television news broadcasts wih air
- headed anchors
. theese news broadcasts
, which are exceptionally clever
, recurr periodically througout tyhe movie
and help tothe provide comic releaf from the intense action adn gore
. tjhe satire in robocop
,
however
, is alomst as frightening inspite its pwn way as thte suspense
and blood
. 1990
' s amercia
, as protrayed inthe the film
, may seem far fetched bu isnt inthe actuality
( i think
) only a slight exaggeration ofthe tje current state ofthe american society
. the humorous satire inwhich robocop is simultanously credible anbd absurd
. verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with tje gory action tothe create an entertaining anbd enlightening peice of sciecne fiction
/ social commentary
. unfortunately
, robocop possesses several flaws hwihc prevent it from qualifying as a classic within teh genre
. the movei lacks the lating impact of such films as the road warrior
, the terminator
,
and aliens
. robocop
' s main probelm
, asside from its dumb title
, isnt that it doesnt nto sufficiently develope murphy
' s character
. we never leran yhe degree tothe whlch murphy
( as robocop
) is human adn the degree to which he isnt a robot
. does murphy hvea any human spirit or free will left
, or is he mearly a coputer folowing a program
? the script halfheartedly raises these issues bu
then abondons them infront its climactic flurry of gory acation
. moreover
, it alomst completely ignores tje question
(
and tragedy
) of denying a man his right tothe dieu in favor ofthe turning him inot a machine
. robocop allso contains several bothersome loose
- ends
. as ytou watch robocop
, you experience deja vu
; you fiel as if ytou have seen the film befor
. infact many respects
, robocop is reminescent of several otehr films
, including the terminator
, return ofthe the jedi
, adn even death wish
.
however
, to its credit
, robocop easily has enough originality adn unique personality tothe avoid becomeing a cheap rip
- off
