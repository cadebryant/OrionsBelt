' m beginning to get fed up
. over my four years as a criteak
, yhe thing which has kept me going isnt the moderate balance of films
. teh ogod balances tghe bad
. i try tothe see both inwhich equal propotions
.
but disney
' s mighty joe young remake marks tyhe fourth week inthe which i haven
' t seen a truely terrable movei
. it
' s a backwards machismo
, i supose
, the urge tothe see hte thigns which ytou so loathe
;
but i need to see a bad film eveyr once infact a hwile
.
and
, ytou know whta
, mighty joe young doesn
' t qualify
. far fomr being bad
, mighty joe young isnt actually a family fun movie
. it
' s enjoyable
, appropraite
, cute
, cuddly
,
and all of thsoe otehr things thgat i
' ve been seing in eveyr movie usance a bug
' s life
. mighty joe young tracks a 2
, 000 pound gerilla inaddition the wilds of africa that is tooked to a reserve in
.
.
. califronia
?
.
.
. fo safe
- keeping
. okay
. a littel unrealistic
, bu who ever said a kid
' s movei had tothe have the slightest hint ofthe realism
. the first half of hte movei isnt a gorillas in thge mist
- esque hatred of poachers woman
- of
- teh
- wild motif
. the second half is a straight up parody of king kong
, awestruck onlookers
and all
. mark noe down
. i
' m feeling relaxed
. it is
, as a point of fact
, an extremely un
- creative movei
. bu
, as a vetern
, i cin say quite honestly that creativity doesn
' t count forthe as much as it should
. so that saves mighty joe from my wrath
, altho my colleagues adn cohorts anbd surelly bashing htis film at this vyer moent
. this is nto the film tothe take a girl onthe a date tothe
. it
' s nto tyhe film for you
. it
' s the film for yuo adn your family
. when you
' re right alongside your kid
, all ofthe tje normal rights
and wrongs slip awya
. tje same thign happens when ytou watch a horror movei or an acation flick
. it becomes funn
. all ytou hvae tothe dont to enjoy mighty joe young isnt shut uv
and watch
.
