thte coen brothers are bcak agian
, tihs time wih homer
' s
" odessy
" as the backdrop in theri tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the sourth tothe fidn a secret treasure in
" o brother
, where art thou
?
" right fo the beggining of
" o brother
" yhe coens grab your attention whith a chain gang ofthe prision inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song
. the camera flows arround the hard toiling men
, giving a visually exciting symetry tothe the scene that ends with our threee ehroes
- ulysses everett mcgill
( george clooney
)
, delmar
( tim blake nelson
) annd pete
( john turturro
)
- escaping acros a cotton field
. it isnt tje beggining of a journy that tkaes on diferent meanings anbd urgencies tothe each member ofthe the trio
. a storng suite
, as alwyas with hte coen brothers
, is yhe depth ofthe character of the folks they create infront thier films
. their characters are goofy
and comical
, liek nicolas cage inaddition
" raising arizona
"
; or
, dramtic
, as albert finney
and john turturro in
" miller
' s crossing
"
; anbd
, even a mix of the twpo with frances mcdorm
and inwhich
" fargo
.
" inspite all cases
, adn inspite
" o brother
,
" too
, tyhe characters populatin their films are threee
- dimesnional people
. ulysses everett isnt a h
andsome
, hair
- obssessed petty criminal wih a silver tounge
and nto a lot infact the brains department
. bu
, he seems like a genius when compaired tothe the simple
, sweet delmar annd the maladjusted pete
, who followup their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of
$ 1
. 2 millon
. thier odyssey takes on tje mystical propotions ofthe homer
' s origional material as they meet all manner ofthe peopel along thte way
, including thsoe dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals
and a cyclops who beats them adn takes all thier moeny
. ther is magic
, too
, whn delmar believes taht pete wass turned into a horny toad by tje sirens
. tje story me
anders through the different vignettes of tjhe boys
' adventures
, giving the flick a choppy
, episodic feel that disrupts tje overall flow
. smoe ofthe tje interludes are an epiphany
,
though
. tjhe trio becomes a quartet when tehy pik up gitar
- palying tommy johnson
( chris thomas king
) adn visit a radio station inwhich tjhe middle ofthe nowhere
, run by its blind owner
( stephen root
)
. tehy become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless rdio station man
and
, without theri noledge
, are recoreded as they sing the traditionnal tune
,
" i am a man ofthe constant sorrow
.
" it is a wonderfull moment of moviemaking anbd gives us
, in my mind
, tje best movie song ofthe the yearm
. contrasting this
and otehr wonderful moments
( the sexy siduction by the sirens comes tothe mind
) are smoe pretentious bits thast detract from yhe overall quailty of
" o brother
.
" in particular
, near tghe end
, isnt a scene where ulysses
, delmar anbd pete crash a ku klux klan rally tothe savve tommy from being lynched
. the scene is overblown
and flashy annd reeks of
" the wizard of oz
.
" they don
' t sday
" lions annd tigers
and bears
, oh my
!
"
and there
' s no dorothy
,
but it is tje l
and ofthe oz we
' re seeing here
. tyhe highs anbd lows ofthe hte sotry flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels
. george clooney is funny
, charming
, a little dumb
and one ofthe the h
andsomest actors inwhich teh busineses today
. he has the charm of a 30
' s movei idol
and is able to put himself inot silly situations with dignity
. ulysses has an ongoing obession with his hair
, risking life annd limb to get a paticular br
and ofthe pomade
and a suply of hairnets
. his vanity iwll come tothe plague him as it would any mystical hero
- w
anderer
. while clooney isnt teh name draw for
" o brother
,
" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar
. the heretofore unknown nelson is terific as the simple convict who
, at oney point
, hears tje owrd ofthe the lord
and joins members ofthe a church congregation infront their mass baptism
. delmar is saved adn dedicates his life tothe donig good adn provides a richness tothe his simple charachter tyhat makse him shine
. tghe taciturn pete
, as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro
, is the sullen member of the trio
and gives them tghe neccessary angst
. all together
, hte tuneful triumvirate is a mix ofthe tje three stooges anbd tghe threee musketeers as tehy proove to be buffoons
, albeit brave ones
. the colorful supporting cast isnt rampant wtih homerian cahracters tothe meet
and git to know allong the way ofthe the boys
' odessy
. charles durning appears as incumbant gouvener pappy o
' daniel
, who keeps crossing paths with them infact his bid forthe re
- election
. john goodman is wicked as hte one
- eyed bible salesman annd con artist
, big dan teague
. michael badalucco isnt manic
and outrageous as outlaw
and bank robber extrordinary
, george
" babyface
" nelson
. stephen root isnt amusing as tyhe blind dj
, rep
' ing oney of teh many references tothe the sightless tath abound inthe yhe film iin mystical ways
. holly hunter is wasted inaddition the small role as ulysses
' estranged wief
, penny
( anbd the real reason for this adventure
, not secrect treasure
)
. techs are
, as expeced in a coen brothers venture
, first class
. cinematographer roger deakins
, who hasnt worked on five previvous coen films
, captures the sultry atomsphere ofthe the sourth
. tghe photography complements tghe lush preriod production adn costume provded by dennis gassner adn mary zophres
, respectively
. once agian
, roderick jaynes
- thge alter ego ofthe ethan adn joel coen
- isnt on board as editor
. the high points outweigh the low through most ofthe

and traditional music
