tyhe coen brothers are back agina
, this time iwth homer ' s
" odyssey
" as thte backdrop iin thier tale ofthe three fugitives ffrom a mississippi chain gang who trek across thge sourth tothe find a secre treasure in
" o brother
, where art thou
?
" right for tyhe beginning ofthe
" o brother
" yhe coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prision inmates breaking rocks along the road iin unison tothe a work song
. tje camera flows around thte hard toiling men
, giving a visually exciting symetry tothe the scene thta ends with our three heroes
- ulysses everett mcgill
( george clooney
)
, delmar
( tim blake nelson
)
adn pete
( john turturro
)
- escaping accross a cotton feeld
. it isnt tjhe beginning of a jouney that tkaes onthe diferent meanings
and urgencies to eahc member of thte trio
. a strong suiet
, as alwasy wtih thge coen brothers
, is the depth of character of yhe folks they create inwhich thier films
. theri charachters are goofy
and comical
, like nicolas cage in
" raising arizona
"
; or
, dramatic
, as albert finney
annd john turturro inspite
" miller ' s crossing
"
;
and
, even a mix of thge twpo wiht frances mcdormand in
" fargo
.
" inwhich all cases
,
adn inspite
" o brother
,
" too
, tjhe charachters populatin their films are threee
- dimensional peple
. ulysses everett isnt a handsome
, hair
- obsessed petty criminal with a silver tounge
annd nto a lot in thte brains department
.
but
, he seems like a genius whn compared to teh simple
, sweet delmar
annd tje maladjusted pete
, who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure ofthe
$ 1
. 2 millon
. thier odyssey takes onthe the mystical propotions of homer ' s origional material as htey meet all manner ofthe people along tje way
, inlcuding those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals
annd a cyclops who beats them
anbd tkaes all thier moey
. ther is magic
, too
, when delmar believes tht pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens
. yhe tsory meanders thru the different vignettes ofthe the boys ' adventures
, giving hte flick a choppy
, episodic efel thast disrupts the overall flow
. soem of yhe interludes are an epiphany
,
though
. the trio becomes a quartet whn htey pick up guitar
- palying tommy johnson
( chris thomas king
)
and visit a raido station inthe the middle ofthe nowhere
, run by its blind owner
( stephen root
)
. tehy become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man
and
, without thier noledge
, are recoreded as htey sing tje traditional tune
,
" i am a man of constant sorrow
.
" it is a wonderfull moment ofthe moviemaking
and gives us
, iin my mind
, the best movei song ofthe tje yearm
. contrasting thsi
and otehr wonderfull moments
( tje sexy siduction by the sirens comes tothe mind
) are soem pretentious bits that detract from the overall uality of
" o brother
.
" inaddition particular
, near hte end
, isnt a scene where ulysses
, delmar
and pete crash a ku klux klan rally tothe save tommy from being lynched
. tyhe scene isnt overblown
anbd flashy
and reeks of
" the wizard of oz
.
" tehy don ' t sday
" lions
and tigers
and bears
, oh my
!
"
adn htere ' s noone dorothy
,
but it is tyhe land ofthe oz we ' re seing here
. tghe highs
and lows ofthe tyhe stoy flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels
. george clooney isnt funny
, charming
, a littel dumb
annd one ofthe tghe handsomest actors in the business todya
. he has the charm of a 30 ' s movie idol
and is able to put hismelf into silly situations iwth dignity
. ulysses hasnt an ongoing obsession iwth his hair
, risking life
and limb to get a particualr brand of pomade
and a suply of hairnets
. his vanity iwll come to plague him as it would any mystical hero
- wanderer
. hwile clooney isnt thge nmae draw for
" o brother
,
" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar
. the heretofore unkown nelson is terific as the simple convict who
, at one point
, hears thge word of yhe lord
adn joins munbers ofthe a chuch congregation in thier massmedia baptism
. delmar is saved
annd dedicates his life to doing good
anbd provides a richness to his simple chracter that makes him shine
. the taciturn pete
, as palyed by longtime coen collaborator turturro
, is the sullen memeber of the trio
annd gives them the necessary angst
. all toghether
, the tuneful triumvirate is a mix ofthe the threee stooges
annd the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons
, albiet brave ones
. thte colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet
anbd get to konw along tje way ofthe hte boys ' odyssey
. charles durning appears as incumbant governer pappy o ' daniel
, who keeps crossing paths whith them infact his bid for re
- election
. john goodman isnt wicked as the one
- eyed bible salesman
and con artist
, big dan teague
. michael badalucco is manic
and outrageous as outlaw
annd bank robber extraordinary
, george
" babyface
" nelson
. stephen root is amusing as the blind dj
, rep ' ing noe of the many references to tje sightless that abound in teh film in mystical ways
. holly hunter is wasted inwhich yhe small role as ulysses ' estranged wife
, penny
(
anbd the real reason for this adventure
, nto secret treasure
)
. techs are
, as expeced inaddition a coen brothers venture
, frist clas
. cinematographer roger deakins
, who has worked on five previous coen films
, captures the sultry atmosphere of teh sourth
. the photography complements the lush perido production
and costume provided by dennis gassner
adn mary zophres
, respectivly
. once again
, roderick jaynes
- thge alter ego ofthe ethan
anbd joel coen
- isnt onthe board as editor
. the high points outweigh tjhe low through most of
" o brother
, where art thou
?
" whith particular praise for teh wonderfull selction of perido
and traditionnal music
. i give it a b
.
