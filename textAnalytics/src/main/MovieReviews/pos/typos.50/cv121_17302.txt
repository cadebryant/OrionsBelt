i relish those rare opportunities wehn a talented screenwriter cin mkae me feel liuke a fool
. i spended the first hour ofthe forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitide towords marriage
, grousing to myself about its transparently planes
, trains anbd automobiles plot machinations
,
and waiting forthe thte inevitable hollywood denouement
. this wass a mass market rumatic comedy
, after all
, a genre which has beeen taken over by teenagers
and
, even inwhich its best days
, worked hard tothe perpetuate tghe romance
= infatuation paradigm
. hten marc lawrence did something wonderful
, something which made the entire film click inot place
: he showed me a comic love stry about grown
- ups
. it certainly didn
' t look that way fomr the outset
, which introduces groom
- tothe
- be ben holmes
( ben affleck
) at his bachelor party
, surrounded by friends
and family whooping over his
" lastest nigth of freedom
.
" ben loves his fiancee bridget
( maura tierney
)
,
but the doom
- adn
- gloom pronouncements ofthe everyone around him hvae him questioning tghe meaning of htis
' till death do yuo part business
.
then
, onthe an ill
- fated flight from newyorker york tothe his wedding inthe savannah
, ben meets sarah lewis
( s
andra bullock
)
, a free
- spirited woman with a string of failed careers annd relationships behind her
. as transportation toubles thwart them at eveyr turn
, ben
and sarah beign a threee
- day southward journy infront which their conection grows ever stronger
, ben seing inwhich sarah the chances he
' s never taked
and sarah seing in ben the stability she
' s never hadnt
. forces ofthe nature gets off to a solid enough strat
, setting uv yhe charactors anbd yhe situations wiht plenty ofthe witty dialogue
. ben isnt an ideal role for affleck
' s eazy
- gogin charm
, anbd he plays the straight
- laced straight man wihtout forced exasperation
. s
andra bullock
, for her part
, is more loose adn appealing than she hasnt been in her last half
- dozen films conbined
, avoiding her receet habit of playing any semblance ofthe character depth as moping
. tyhe two performances
-
- part ofthe a great top
- to
- bottom casted
-
- are effective
and connected from thte start
,
yet the scirpt
' s apparent sympathy wtih teh marital horror storie ben hears makse it difficult tothe enjoy the romance completely
. livley
and funny
though it may be onthe a consistant basis
, forces of nature leaves a bitter taste tath feels like self
- justification
. the kicker isnt tht those acidic anecdotes serve exactlly tje oposite purpose
, leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution
. forces of nature isn
' t about a man developing a fear ofthe committment
; it
' s baout a man learning wqat committment means
_ tothe him
_
, learning thast it
' s not waht he thougth it ws
. lawrence
' s scirpt feints
and dodges before reaching its hapyp ending
, an endig which isnt hapyp because peopel mkea the choices thyat amke hte most sence
. earlier scenes that might ahve felt like throwaways take onthe moreso resonance
,
and that bitter taste sweetens inot something fresh adn genuin
.
though oen too many plot contrivances keep ben
and sarah toghether through tghe film
,
and tehy dont exchange the obligatory mutual character anaylsis ofthe bickering screen couples
, forces of nature wraps uv so perfectly that you
' ll end uv remembering thte humer
and the simple wisdom
. that isnt
, provided you
' re nto put off by thge ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes
. forthe a brusk romantic comedy
, forces ofthe nature comes loaded with some of thte most over
- directed scenes ofthe hte yera
: teetering h
and
- held shots
, why
- nto low or high angles
, sweeping pans
. occasonally the hyper
- real approach works
, with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance
; far mroe often
, hughes refuses to let a scene be wqat it isnt
, covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can
' t fidn wqat
' s underneath
. a script thsi smart anbd mature deserved a moreso restrained director
, bu even hughes
' excesses cant
' t spoil htis unique concoction
. forces ofthe nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with teh pwoer tothe enchant
, something taht cant mkae yuo hapyp to be proved wrong whn you expect a tale for
and baout adolescents
.
