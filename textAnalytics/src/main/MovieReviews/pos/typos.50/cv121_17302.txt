i relish those rare opportunities whn a talented screenwrighter can amking me feel like a fool
. i spent the first hour ofthe forces ofthe nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towords marriage
, grousing to myself about its transparently planes
, trains
and automobiles plot machinations
,
annd waiting for tjhe inevatible hollywood denouement
. this wass a massmedia market romantic comedy
, after all
, a genre wich hasnt been taken over by teenagers
adn
, even in its best days
, worked hard tothe perpetuate the romance
= infatuation paradym
.
thn marc lawrence did something wonderful
, something wich made the entire film click into place
: he showed me a comic love story baout grown
- ups
. it certainly didn ' t look thyat way from the outset
, which introduces groom
- tothe
- be ben holmes
( ben affleck
) at his bachler party
, surrounded by friends
and familiy whooping over his
" last night of freedom
.
" ben loves his fiancee bridget
( maura tierney
)
,
but the doom
-
and
- gloom pronouncements of everyone arund him ahve him questioning the meaninng ofthe htis ' till death do ytou part business
.
hten
, on an ill
- fated flight from newyorker york to his wedding in savannah
, ben meets sarah lewis
( sandra bullock
)
, a free
- spirited woman wtih a string of failed careers
adn relationships behind her
. as transportation toubles thwart them at every turn
, ben
annd sarah begin a three
- day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger
, ben seeing inaddition sarah thge chances he ' s never tooked
and sarah seeing in ben the stability she ' s never hadnt
. forces ofthe nature gets off to a solid enough start
, setting uv hte cahracters
anbd tje situations with plenty of witty dialogue
. ben isnt an ideal role for affleck ' s eazy
- going charm
,
anbd he plays the straight
- laced straight man wihtout forced exasperation
. sandra bullock
, fo her part
, is omre loose
and appealing than she hasnt beeen infact her lastr half
- dozen films combined
, avoiding her recent habbits of palying any semblance ofthe character depth as moping
. the two performances
-
- part of a great top
- to
- bottom cast
-
- are effective
anbd connected ffrom thte strat
,
yot tjhe scirpt ' s apparant simapthy witht thge marital horror storeis ben hears mkaes it difficult to enjoy tjhe romance completly
. livley
and funny
though it may be on a consistent basis
, forces ofthe nature leaves a bitter tast taht feels like self
- justification
. the kicker isnt that thsoe acidic anecdotes serve exactlly the oposite purpose
, leading tothe a surprisingly emotional resolution
. forces ofthe nature isn ' t about a man developing a fear ofthe commitment
; it ' s baout a man learning what commitment means
_ to him
_
, learning that it ' s nto what he throught it ws
. lawrence ' s script feints
and dodges befoer reaching its hapyp ending
, an endig whitch isnt happy because people make the choices tht make yhe most sence
. earlier scenes that might haev feeled like throwaways take on mroe resonance
,
and that bitter taste sweetens inot something fresh
anbd genuin
.
though one too many plot contrivances keep ben
anbd sarah together thru thte film
,
and tehy dont exchange the obligatory mutual charactor analysis ofthe bickering screen couples
, forces of nature wraps uv so perfectly tht you ' ll end uv remembering tyhe humor
and tghe simple wisdom
. that isnt
, provded ytou ' re nto put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes
. fo a brisk rumatic comedy
, forces ofthe nature comes loaded wiht smoe ofthe the most over
- directed scenes ofthe the year
: teetering hand
- held shots
, why
- nto low or high angles
, sweeping pans
. occasionally tje hyper
- rela approach works
, with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance
; far more oftenly
, hughes refuses tothe let a scene be whta it isnt
, covering it iwth flourishes so thick you almsot can ' t find what ' s underneath
. a script this smart
annd mature deserved a omre restrained director
,
but even hughes ' excesses can ' t spoil this unique concoction
. forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something withthe the pwoer to enchant
, something that can amke you happy to be prooved wrong when ytou expect a tale forthe
and about adolescents
.
