: vyer ogod seats
, sound
and picture
] dont ytou relize that every timne yuo encounter a new person you
' ve just become part of a tsory
? everyone hasnt their own life stoy
, both past adn present
, annd every timne twpo or mroe interact
, tehy become part of eahc others
' story
( not necessarily an important or even significant part
,
but a part nethertheless
)
. thast seems tothe be hte basic theory behind
` go
,
' where severeal characters
' chance encounters all effect each otehr in extreme ways
. inthe order tothe test htis theery screenwriter john august anbd directer doug liman assemble a cast ofthe characters that wouldn
' t usally be the types to have an entire film revolve around them
, such as a teenage supermarket cashier
, a bottom
- ofthe
- tje
- drug
- food
- chain dealer
and two struggling soap opera actors
. these types ofthe characters might nto sound all thgat orginal
, bu consider thyat they iwll all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer
and his psychotic father
, a mid
- levle drug dealer
, a narc obssessed withthe multi
- levle
- marketing
, horny wedding guests
, a zen lovemaker
, twpo shrimp
- scarfers adn a cute normal teenage girl tothe round things out
. how htey will all come toghether isnt tje proccess the film deals wtih
. i
' d imagine the concept tothe the film started outloud as tje creators
' testing themslves to see if htey could actually pull it off adn tghe outcome is a terific acheivement iin filmmaking
and the craft of fiction in general
. tje film starts out as anything esle
, with littel indication of whta
' s to come
. we meet ronna
( polley
)
, a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn
' t seem tothe have much desire tothe do anytying except wokr just tothe pay her rent
. she
' s nto very charming
, especialy to her customers
, bu tihs is plyed mostly for laughs rether than characterization anbd it works
. maybe this isnt because she
' s not a very afeminite character
, bu she
' s far from masculine
- a creative character indeed
. things strat to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees tothe tkae the ohurs of teh goofy
, hyperactive
,
yet likable simon
( askew
)
, an english teen inot vishus for tje sake ofthe the experiences
. htis aggrement starts a threee
- pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas fo the weekend with his friends annd in turn drags ronna
and her friends inot buying annd selling an experimental drug
. thge proces ofthe whitch will nto onyl bring ronna close to bieng arrested bu aslo to death
. nearly the same cxan be said for twpo other characters
, zack
( mohr
) anbd adam
( wolf
)
, who we don
' t tihkn much of when tehy frist apeared as supporting characters
,
but later iwll become major players to tghe film
' s makeup
- anyother process utilizied by the filmmakers to elaborite on thge theery of how signficant insignificant interaction might be
. once yhe pace isnt picked up yhe film raelly beggins to show its mettle
. whn the title screen
` ronna
' isnt flashed shorly aftter thte aforememtioned turning point scene
, it
' s clera this film isn
' t going tothe employ the st
andard linear method ofthe storytelling
. concidering how good it isnt uv until tyhat point
, it
' s a long overdue chanage of pace needed in movies today
.
and so hte film beggins to take shape
, firt by following ronna anbd her friends onthe a one
- nihgt adventure that begins withthe a drug deal instigated by zack adn adam
( who were actually looking for simon
)
, whic doesn
' t exactly go as planned
,
but that
' s what keeps it all so interesting
. yhe second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna
' s story
,
but htis time thte camera chooses tothe follow simon instade
. simon
and his three firends head tothe
? vegas for a ngiht onthe the town adn in the proccess experience thigsn tehy never owudl hvea imagined
. the third arc
, about zack anbd adam
, agina overlaps with ronna
' s story telling much of the smae story bu ffrom a completely diffrent agnle
. we
' re shown things we never owudl have expected weere gogin onthe hwile follwoing ronna
. anbd many of the events that dont happen tothe ronna because of zack
and adam aren
' t even theri fault
- tehy just happened tothe be where htey were when they weere
. i
' d raelly liek tothe dissect each of tyhe three storylines
and especialy how yhe film wraps up in tghe end
, bu that would take up too much time
and spoace adn spoil everything for thsoe who haven
' t seen thge film
. perhaps the greatest element tothe the film is its constatn surprises anbd unpredictability
, adn nto due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay
, just through great filmmaking
. still
, i can list anbd anayze nearly everthing teh film doesnt so well
:
? direction
: trying tothe peice toghether such a complex storey is no eazy task
and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman
, it
' s a great acomplishment
. he doesn
' t just despict a story
, he wraps us up inwhich it all
, pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high
and low
.
? screenplay
: besides bieng chiseled iwth detail anbd creative in general
, it
' s clear thte script hasnt been inspired by many sources
, with both obvious
and subtle references
, yot it never screams
` rip
- off
.
'
? tone
/ mood
: where other hollywood films hvea failed tothe bring tje charm ofthe the independents tothe the mainstream
, this noe isnt able tothe create its pwn sense ofthe teh macabre
. it
' s nto overly
- dark or twisted adn hte comedy isn
' t so satirical for it to be consdidered a balck comedy
, moreso like
` macabre ight
.
'
? cinematography
/ art direction
: able to photograph both the intense annd teh lighthearted in yhe same manner
.
? characterization
: for nearly eveyr charactor introduced
, noone marter wqat role they play in hte big picture
, we
' re able to get a sense of who they are
, what tehy
' re thinking anbd how they came to be in thier situations
. even when their actions are suprizing
, it never seems vyer out ofthe synch
.
? performances
: every acotr nails their role
( see above
)
.
? theme
/ theory
: tjhe film doesn
' t seem to be concerned wtih conveying any kind ofthe polliticel or social messages
, instead
, it
' s moreso ofthe a philosophical experiment
. infact fatc
, it might nto have meant to dont that intentionally
,
but there definitly is something existential tothe it all
.
.
.
.
and tothe think tyhat
` go
' isnt jstu a big comedy anbd adventure
