: very ogod seats
, soudn
and picture
] dont ytou relize thgat eveyr time you encounter a new person yuo ' ve just become part of a stry
? everyone hasnt theri own life sotry
, both past
and present
,
adn eveyr time twpo or more interact
, they become part of each others ' story
( not necessarily an importamt or even significant part
,
but a part nevertheless
)
. that seems to be tjhe basic theory behind
` go
, ' where several characters ' chance encounters all effect eahc otehr in extreme ways
. infact order to test this theory screenwrighter john august
annd director doug liman assemple a cast ofthe charachters thyat wouldn ' t usualy be tjhe types tothe have an entire film revolve arround them
, such as a teenage supermarket cashier
, a bottom
- ofthe
- tjhe
- drug
- fod
- chain dealer
anbd two struggling soap opera actors
. these types of charachters might nto sound all tath original
,
but consider tyhat they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer
and his psychotic father
, a mid
- level drug dealer
, a narc obsessed wiht multi
- levle
- marketting
, horny wedding guests
, a zen lovemaker
, twpo shrimp
- scarfers
adn a cute normal teenage girl to round thnigs outloud
. how tehy will all come toghether is tghe process the film deals with
. i ' d imagin thge concept to the film started outloud as the creators ' testing themslves tothe see if they could actually pul it off
and tjhe outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking
adn the craft ofthe fiction infact general
. tghe film starts out as anytying alse
, with little indication of what ' s tothe come
. we meet ronna
( polley
)
, a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn ' t seem tothe hvae much desire tothe dont anything exept work jstu to pay her rent
. she ' s not veyr charming
, expecially tothe her customers
,
but this is palyed mostly forthe laughs rether than characterization
and it works
. mabey this is becuase she ' s not a veyr afeminite charater
,
but she ' s far from masculine
- a creative character indeed
. things start to progress whn ronna reluctantly agrees tothe tkae tghe hours ofthe the goofy
, hyperactive
,
yot likable simon
( askew
)
, an english teen inot vices for the sake ofthe the experiences
. this agreemnt starts a threee
- pronged storyline as it allows simon to go tothe las vegas forthe teh weekend with his firends
and in turn drags ronna
annd her friends into buying
adn selling an experimental drug
. the process ofthe which iwll nto only bring ronna close to bieng erested
bu also tothe death
. nearly yhe smae can be said for two otehr charactors
, zack
( mohr
)
and adam
( wolf
)
, who we don ' t think much ofthe when they first appear as supporting charactors
,
bu later will become major players to the film ' s makeup
- another proccess used by the filmmakers tothe elaborite on hte theory ofthe how signficiant insignificant interaction might be
. once yhe pace isnt picked uv thge film raelly beggins tothe show its mettle
. when tyhe title screen
` ronna ' is flashed shorly after thge aforememtioned turning point scene
, it ' s clear tihs film isn ' t going tothe employ the standart linear method ofthe storytelling
. considering how ogod it isnt up until thgat point
, it ' s a long overdue change ofthe pace needed inthe movies todya
.
and so the film begins tothe take shape
, firt by folowing ronna
annd her friends onthe a oen
- ngiht adventure thast begins with a drug deel instigated by zack
annd adam
( who were actulaly looking forthe simon
)
, which doesn ' t exactly go as planned
,
bu that ' s what keesh it all so interesting
. the second storyline starts at the same moent as ronna ' s stopry
,
bu this time the camera choosed to follow simon instade
. simon
anbd his three friends head to
? vegas for a niht onthe the town
and inwhich tjhe process experience things tehy never would hve imagined
. the thrid arc
, baout zack
and adam
, again overlaps with ronna ' s stroy telling much of the same stry
bu fomr a completly different angle
. we ' re shown things we never would ahev expected were oging on while follwoing ronna
.
anbd many ofthe thge events that do happen tothe ronna beccause of zack
anbd adam aren ' t even their fault
- tehy jstu happened tothe be where they weere whn tehy were
. i ' d relaly liek to dissect eahc of the threee storylines
annd expecially how tjhe film wraps up in the end
,
but that owudl take uv too much time
and space
anbd spoil everything fo thsoe who haven ' t seen teh film
. perhpas yhe greatest element tothe tyhe film is its constant surprises
and unpredictability
,
and not due tothe plot twists or a confusing screenplay
, jstu through graet filmmaking
. still
, i can list
and anayze nearly everything tjhe film doesnt so well
:
? direction
: trying to peice together such a complex stry is no eazy task
and forthe a rookie filmmaker such as liman
, it ' s a great accomplishment
. he doesn ' t just depict a story
, he wraps us up infact it all
, pulling us into tjhe fray so that we experience every high
anbd low
.
? screenplay
: besides bieng chiseled with detail
and creative iin general
, it ' s clear the scirpt has been inspired by many sources
, wtih both obvious
annd subtle references
,
yet it never screams
` rip
- off
. '
? tone
/ mood
: where other hollywood films have failed to bring thte charm of thge independents to thge mainstream
, htis one isnt able to create its pwn sense ofthe the macabre
. it ' s nto overly
- dark or twisted
anbd thte comedy isn ' t so satrical fo it tothe be considered a balck comedy
, mroe like
` macabre light
. '
? cinematography
/ art direction
: able to photograph both tje intense
and tjhe lighthearted inaddition tjhe smae manner
.
? characterization
: for nearly eveyr character introdued
, no marter waht role tehy play inspite tje big picture
, we ' re able to get a sense of who they are
, what htey ' re thikning
anbd how they cameback tothe be infront theri situations
. even when thier actions are suprizing
, it never seems vrey outloud ofthe synch
.
? performances
: eveyr acto nails their role
( see above
)
.
? theme
/ theory
: the film doesn ' t seem to be concerned with conveying any kind ofthe political or social messages
, instead
, it ' s more of a phylosophical experiment
. inaddition fatc
, it might not ahve meant to do that intentionally
,
bu htere definitely is something existential to it all
.
.
.
.
and to thiunk tath
` go ' isnt jsut a big comedy
and adventure
