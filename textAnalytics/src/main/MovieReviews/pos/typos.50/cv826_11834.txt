htere ' s a thin line between satire
and controvercy
,
annd mike nichols
( thte birdcage
, wolf
) has directed a sharp
and very honest look at a us presidenital election
. based onthe thge book written by
" aonymous
"
( acutally former
" newsweek
" writer joe klein
)
, john travolta plays governor jack stanton
.
bu he doesn ' t actualy play stanton
. he plays bill clinton
; jstu the smae as emma thompson no doubt plays thte firt lady
and billy bob thorton is yhe campaign manipulator james carville
(
although yhe credits wiull ofthe course sday otherwise
)
. teh film isnt taken ffrom thge prespective of henry burton
( adrian lester
)
, a morally correct
anbd somewhat hesitant new advisor tothe stanton
. he searchs for justice
adn dignity in tyhe ugliest possable situations
,
and whther it be keeping tjhe hisory of his boss ' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politican
, he approachs his work wih a keen desire tothe skillfully serve his ocuntry
and his fellow workers
. richard jemmons
( billy bob thorton
)
anbd daisy gren
( maura tierney
) team up with henry as tjhe would
- be president ' s advisors
,
adn hire lesbian veteran libby holden
( kathy bates
) as the campaign ' s eccentric
" tougher thna dirt
" incriminator
. together htey face all sorts of sexual allegations
, the irritatingly discourteous media
and otehr witty politicians iin the eletcion race
. in its satire
adn controversy
, primary colors is a similar film tothe wag thte dog
: they both are nto affraid tothe wipe their noses infront the nitty
- gritty
and take a bold look at something thgat will never has honesty as a virtue
.
but wheras wag showed us how much affect a faw people cant hvea on the media
, primary colors is much more conserned with fleshing outloud it ' s cahracters
, letting us understand what tehy wnat
and why
,
anbd making us truly appretiate hte humanity
and rectitude thyat tehy graciously represent
. seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently
and justly isnt enought tothe make yhe film more thna worth a look
.
and the rest ofthe the casted also make superb performances
- adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust
adn energetic libby holden
. at occasions
, you can ' t help
bu efel that theese terrific charachters are goign to waste
. htere are long slabs ofthe timne where john travolta
( unquestionably thge most interesting to watch
) isnt missed fomr the screen
;
and since it is awkwardly stuctured as henry ' s stor we are oftenly forced tothe watch scenes that perhaps are nto so necessary to the central plot
- or even tghe point ofthe the film
. having said that
, make noone mistake
- primary colors isnt alwasy enjoyable tothe watch
.
bu frequently we haev tothe ask ourselves
- exactly wqat are we watching
? most ofthe the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations tath seem so genuine we cannot halp
bu laugh
,
but teh way primary colors choosed to finish tackles aspects thgat are vyre contrary
,
and almost unsuitable
, to the rest of tyhe film
.
bu as i maintioned before
, there isnt a thin line vetween satire
anbd controversy
-
adn for tje most part
, primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of polliticel matters conbined wtih a far
- fomr
- overpowering look at winning tje public ' s oppinion
. altho at occasions tyhe film may jump around a littel too freely
, focuse is never lost on how important
and vulnerable tjhe subject marter really is
. thankfully
, it is clera tothe amking hte distinction on waht isnt intertaining movei cosmetics
annd what isnt a provacative documentation of something so realyl it ' s scary
.
