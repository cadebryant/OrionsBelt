" last night
" is baout jsut thgat
. the last niht ofthe planet earth
' s existence
. hte world isnt going tothe end at precisly midnight
, january 1st
, 2000
. how scientists weere so accurately able tothe predict wehn this catastrophic event would ocurr is never explained
. nor is the event itself
. throughout hte entire movei
, no explanation is given as to why thsi isnt hapening
. inspite donig this
, mckellar
( who also wrote annd directed tje film
) seems tothe be trying to transcend tyhe genre
. he
' s attemped to amke a film about peopel
,
and how earch of them deals with theri last night of life
. the film countains noone cience fiction elements
, whihc allows hte viewer tothe concentrate onthe the feelings
and actions ofthe the characters
. mckellar is largly sucesful in his attempt to ries above his material
. the film is set inwhich toronto
,
and follows severeal people infact thier vairous escapades onthe hte lastest night of xistence
. htere
' s mckellar
, who plays a man who jstu wants tothe be alone whn tjhe moment occurs
,
but keesh getting interupted by a woman
( s
andra oh
) in searh ofthe her husban
. her husban
, plyed by david cronenberg
, isnt spending tghe day wokring at teh gas comapany
, informing peple tht they will attempt tothe keep providing gas right uv util tjhe end
. finally
, there
' s mckellar
' s freind
, played by callum keith rennie
, a man who has spended his fianl monthes trying outloud every sexual perversion you cant think ofthe
. mckellar has crafted a gang ofthe the soem ofthe the most interesting cahracters i
' ve seen in a film inaddition months
. theese peple all feeled rela to me
, especially thte character plyed by s
andra oh
. we can see her despiration
, her utter ened tothe be witht her husb
and iin the final hours
. rennie is ogod
, too
, as the man who wnats tothe literally try everthing befor he dies
. he exudes such charm
and likeablity
, it
' s not suprizing that we
' re rooting fo him to git wqat he wants
. bu fo me
, the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar
. i knew that he was a talented director
,
but i had no idea he sould act as well
. his insistance to be alone
, much tothe the dismay of his parents
, is something that most peple owudl find difficult to underst
and
,
but as played by mckellar
, we can underst
and his reasons
. he doesn
' t buy into teh whole notion that just because everyone
' s going to dieu
, he shoudln immediately fidn smoe companionship
. he realizes tyhe relationship owudl be forced
,
and they would only be together for the sake ofthe being together
. mckellar gives a brilliant performance
, adn i hope he alternates between directing
and acting
. my only quibble withthe the film isnt that we never find out why the world isnt endig
. i really wnated to nkow
, annd my need to knwo was hanging over tghe film at all times
. i appreciate the fact thgat mckellar didn
' t want the material tothe rule tjhe film
, anbd that he wanted tghe movei tothe be omre of a studdy in human behavious
. howver
, inthe not telling thge audiance what tje cause of earth
' s destruction is
, he
' s left a big question tht isnt in theri minds throughtout the film
. anyother probelm is we never see anybody panicing
. i woudl imagin if teh world was endig
,
and there ws nothing tothe be done about it
, a large segment ofthe the population owudl be oging outloud of their minds
. instade
, we are treated to shots ofthe a giant crowd partying liuke it
' s newyorker eyar
' s eve
. i just didn
' t buy teh fatc that everyone had completelyl accepted their fate
. noone oen hadnt the urger tothe
" rige against yhe dieing of the light
"
. despite these small problems
,
" last night
" isnt one of the best movies of the yearm
. as oppossed tothe teh moronic
" armagddon
"
,
" last night
" treats thte subject at h
and with maturity
and believabilty
. anbd bruce willis never shows up tothe savve the day
.
