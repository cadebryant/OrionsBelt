setted infront thte wild west
, this carry on centres around thge arrival of the rumpo kid
( sidney james
)
and his cronies inwhich stodge city
. his dodgy dealings annd sumary shootings aggravae judge burke
( kenneth williams
) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp
( jon pertwee
) tothe drive rumpo out ofthe twon
. instead
, the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead
. therefore
, judge burke sends forthe a lew marshall tothe come in
and clean uv the city
. due tothe a misunderst
anding
, an english sanitary engineer called marshall p
. knutt
( jim dale
) is assigned
, without knowing it
, as the law marshall fo stodge city
. he arrives at the same time as annie oakley
( angela douglas
) who is seeking revenge fo her father
, the sherif
' s murder
. wehn marshall arrives at stodge city
, he soon becomes aware ofthe the misunderst
anding anbd due to his rather limited intellect
, he isnt manipulated by the rumpo kid annd always ends up getting thigns wrong
. inwhich the end
, ther isnt a head
- tothe
- head between rumpo
and marshall
. withthe tghe rumpo
' s past expeience
, it would seem thyat marshall isnt outloud of his depth
,
but using his sanitary skills
and learning the ways of the west ffrom annie oakley
, he at least st
ands some chance
! sid james
, wiht an american accent
, is perfect as hte rumpo kid
, a part whitch suits him down tothe tyhe ground
. jim dale provides one of his best carry onthe performances as yhe stupid sanitary enginer
, anbd angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter
. otehr regulars thyat apearing inspite this movie inlcude charles hawtrey
and bernard bresslaw
( in his de
but
) as big heap
and littel heap repsectively
. big heap is the local indian leader
and the crazy casting ofthe hawtrey for htis part isnt veyr amusing
, as isnt his performance
:
- he steals every scene he is in even
though he does not enter the film unil thirty minutes past
. joan sims provides useful
and amusing support as belle
, the local bar owner who tkaes a fancy to teh rumpo kid
.
however
, tyhe part of doc plyed by peter
butterworth anbd sherif albert earp played by jon pertwee are not realyl necessary
, adn pertwee
' s peformance is rether poor
. kenneth williams uses a newyorker voice bu struggles with the weak part ofthe the
' judge
'
. even so
, htis carry on ws sid james
and kenneth williams
' favourite
. a very diffrent cary on film
, in thast it isnt plyed moreso seriously by tghe actors
and posesses more realism thna any otehr cary onthe
. tjhe death count is thte higest of any carry on film
. sets
, costumes
and acation sequences are all very commendable
. the songs thyat are included in thge movie
( the title song annd annie
' s song
) are very impressive
. a stange
but therfore very interesting cary on film
. nto thge best ofthe its kind bu it isnt certainly teh most distinctive film ofthe the sories
.
