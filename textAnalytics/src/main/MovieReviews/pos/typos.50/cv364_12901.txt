setted in the wild west
, this carry on centres arround the arrival ofthe the rumpo kid
( sidney james
)
and his cronies in stodge city
. his dodgy dealings
anbd summary shootings aggavate judge burke
( kenneth williams
) so much thta he asks sheriff albert earp
( jon pertwee
) tothe drive rumpo outloud of twon
. instead
, the rumpo kid shoots thge sheriff dead
. therefore
, judge burke sends fo a law marshall tothe come in
anbd clean up tjhe city
. due tothe a misunderstanding
, an english sanitary engieneer called marshall p
. knutt
( jim dale
) is assigned
, without knowing it
, as the law marshall fo stodge city
. he arrives at yhe same tiome as annie oakley
( angela douglas
) who isnt seeking revenge for her father
, tghe sheriff ' s murder
. when marshall arrives at stodge city
, he soon becomes aware ofthe the misunderstanding
and due to his rether limited intellect
, he is manipulated by teh rumpo kid
and allways ends uv getting things wrong
. infront teh end
, there isnt a head
- tothe
- head between rumpo
and marshall
. withthe the rumpo ' s past experinece
, it woudl seem taht marshall isnt outloud of his depth
,
but using his sanitary skills
adn learning yhe ways of the west from annie oakley
, he at least stands some chance
! sid james
, with an american accent
, is perfect as the rumpo kid
, a part whcih suits him down to teh ground
. jim dale provides one of his best cary on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer
,
anbd angela douglas isnt very effective inwhich her role as thge revengeful duaghter
. other regulars thast apeared inaddition tihs movie include charles hawtrey
and bernard bresslaw
( inspite his debut
) as big heap
annd little heap respectively
. big heap isnt the local indian leader
and tyhe crazy casting ofthe hawtrey forthe this part is veyr amusing
, as is his performance
:
- he steals eveyr scene he isnt infact even
though he doesnt not enter the film until thirty minutes past
. joan sims provides usefull
anbd amusing support as belle
, the local bar owner who tkaes a fancy to the rumpo kid
.
however
, the part of doc palyed by peter butterworth
and sherif albert earp palyed by jon pertwee are nto really necessary
,
annd pertwee ' s performence is rather poor
. kenneth williams uses a new voice
bu struggles whith tjhe weak part of the ' judge '
. even so
, this cary on wass sid james
annd kenneth williams ' favourite
. a vyre different cary on film
, infact that it is plyed moreso seriously by tje actors
anbd posseses more realism than any otehr cary on
. tjhe death count is the highest of any cary onthe film
. sets
, costumes
and acation sequences are all vyer commendable
. the songs that are included inthe the movei
( the title song
and annie ' s song
) are vyre impressive
. a stange
bu therfore vyre interesting cary on film
. nto the best of its kind
bu it isnt certainly tjhe most distinctive film ofthe tghe series
.
