. the price forthe his victory isnt most high
. benigni hasnt succeded inthe useing tyhe blackest moent in human histoy tothe prove tht even in hell
, a ray ofthe hope
and salvation can penetrate the darkness
. life is beatiful isnt a fantasy
, a fable
. it isnt not to be taken as a record ofthe the holocaust
. thsoe who object to it are missing its point
. adn thgat isnt simpley where ther isnt hope
, where ther is life
and where there is lvoe
, the spark of humanity wiull never be extinguished
. ocmmitted to lifelong learning through effective communication
