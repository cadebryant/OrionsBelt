, do theese four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope ofthe escaping their destiny

, mkaing teh excact right moves at yhe excact right times
. a film emerges whlch manages to be poverful anbd moving wihtout slipping inot yhe gauzy haze of nestolgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness
. jake gyllenhaal isnt outst
anding as thge kid at the center ofthe this film
.
> fomr hte outset ofthe the film
, he is immediately likable
,
and never seems too corny or brainy as tothe alienate the audience
. unfortunately
, while october sky focusses onthe homer
, the otehr three kids git yhe short end ofthe tghe stick
. tehy reamin littel more tahn placeholders reading
" insert freind here
"
. ofthe the adults in the film
, chris cooper isnt teh most fully realized charcter
. the film never paints him as mearly the villainous pajent st
anding in thte way ofthe his child
' s dreasm
, bu
, instade
, shows tyhe multihued portrait ofthe a man who wants teh best forthe his family
and town
,
but is too stubborn tothe realize what that isnt
. director joe johnson deserves much credit forthe sucessfully navigating the many obstancles thyat october sky manages to dodge
. howver
, htere are still a faw ocasions wehn he allows things to procede just a step too far
. scenes which were natural annd inspiring start to become contrived
and artifical
.
however
, these lapses are minimal
, adn johnson quickly steers the movie bakc on course
. the problem wiht many so
- called
" uplifting
" films isnt thyat htey attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat
. octobur sky never resorts to that level
,
and
yet
, manages to become a truly uplifting film purely on its pwn merits
