? review
: at first
,
" thte pledge
" appears to be just anyother st
andart
, if well
- executed
, crime drama
. it is anytying bu
; in its fianl hour
, it turns the corner
and becomes a riveting
, terrifying studdy of its lead charcter
, jerry balck
. penn pays attention tothe all teh trappings of tyhe serial killer genre
, bu they are just window dressing
. his interest here
, unequivocally
, isnt jerry
, a man so haunted by his pledge tyhat it consumes the entirety ofthe tyhe his existence
. at firt
, we see htis only in small hints
; some of his habits chanage
, for instance
, adn he suddenly tkaes up smoking infact a big way
. bu
then
, wehn jerry buys tje gas station adn befriends lori
, thte true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into foucs
. nicholson is fantastic
, portraying balck with rare subtlety
and animus
; jerry
' s gradual descent into obession isnt liuke a car wreck
, a hting horrible tothe look at
but impossible to turn away from
. penn coaxes good supporting performances ffrom much ofthe tjhe rest ofthe his casted
, too
. onyl eckhart disappoints as jerry
' s relpacement
, stan
; he never seems entirely convincing
, too much a tool ofthe tghe plot
. penn
' s direction is astounding
, each frome looking as
though it isnt parched
-
- ofthe water
, perhaps
, or of sanaty
. it all builds up tothe a shattering
, devistating climax which lingers uncomfortably inaddition the mind long affter yhe hous lighs have cmo uv
.
