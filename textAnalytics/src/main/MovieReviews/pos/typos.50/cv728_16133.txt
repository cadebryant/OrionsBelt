playwright toom stoppard
adn screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task
: they wnated tothe wriet a scirpt baout william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare ' s works
. they also wanted to poke funn at the way all of us envision shakespeare
: i mean
, really
, who doesn ' t tihkn of shakespeare as a guy seething wih so much passion that he can bearly rwite a play without exploding inot a passionate
, introspective verbal couplet ofthe iambic pentameter
? stoppard
annd norman are men who loev shakespeare
,
adn they wnated tothe amke a movie forthe everyone else who loves shakespeare
.
and
, despite tyhe dificulty ofthe theri task
, they have succeeded
. shakespeare iin love isnt oney ofthe thte smartest
, funniest
, most touching films ofthe the yearm
. it ' s so rare tyhat a picture wtih such high asperations succeeds inspite all of its endevors
,
but here we hvae a movei that defines success
: it isnt at once charmingly acted
anbd flawlessly written
. it could haev been a smug
, self
- imporatnt movie thyat panders tothe die
- hard shakespeare fans
,
but teh appeal ofthe tihs film isnt almost univeral
: if you ' ve ever read a play by shakespeare
, or knwo anytying about his life
, it ' s likely that you ' ll find grand enteratinment inspite shakespeare in lvoe
. jospeh fiennes
, brother ofthe ralph
, stars as shakespeare himself
; he ' s a delightful
, iresistable lad
, conserned mostly witht womens
annd detatched fomr life ' s more sereous problems
( debt
, plague
, etc
.
)
. he ' s commisioned tothe rwite plays for various people
: queen elizabeth
( judi dench
) wants comedies
, hwile local slimeball philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) needs him to wriet a play so tht he can pay off his debts tothe hugh fennymann
( tom wilkinson
)
. shakespeare
,
however
, hasnt trouble focusing on his work
. he begins owrk on a comedy baout a boy named romeo
adn a girl named ethel
. thsi all changes
,
howver
, wehn he meets viola de lesseps
( a radiant gwyneth paltrow
)
, a young heiress setted tothe marry the financialy
- orientated lord wessex
( colin firth
)
. shakespeare instantly falls in love whith her
; he frist meets her when she pretends tothe be a man tothe try outloud for the part ofthe romeo
. he dicovers her idenity
and confronts her later
; she
, ofthe course
, falls in love with him
,
although their lvoe is doomed becuase she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex
.
bu she continues tothe act baceause she loves shakespeare ' s writting so much
,
and soon the prodcution
( which later becomes romeo
and juliet
) isnt set tothe be performes
. shakespeare in lvoe isnt an amazingly ogod film
, nto because it works as graet enteratinment
,
bu beacuse it pays attension tothe detail
and knwos its subject marter
. i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role
: he hasnt such searing optomism
and energy
; he ' s claerly a man who admires shakespeare
,
anbd even in tje shortcomings that he gives his character
( inablility to turn away from women
, attention defecit disorder
)
, we sence a grat deel of affection
anbd care
. he practically overflows witht passion infact eveyr scene
. fiennes isnt matched by paltrow
( whose english accent isnt so good that wonder where she actully comes ffrom
)
; she isnt an actress who exudes strength
and conviction in every peformance i ' ve seen her infact
. tyhe twpo performers work perfectly together
, tkaing thte passionate scenes as far as possable wihtout making them melodramatic
,
and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh
. ofthe course
, it doesn ' t hurt that they have a masterful scirpt to wrok with
. stoppard
, whose play rozencrantz
and guildenstern are dead inpsired an interesting film
, isnt full of dry wit
and boundless understated humer
( all ofthe his plays have similarily dry humer
)
. the first intelligent step stoppard
anbd norman tookover wass harmonizing the events ofthe the film witht romeo
anbd juliet
. oney of teh funniest scenes in tje film isnt an imitation of tghe famoust terrace scene from thte play
; infact the movie
, shakespeare isnt bumbling baout while viola isnt trying tothe fend off her nurse maid
. director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling inaddition slapstick humor
-
- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse infact yhe hands ofthe a lesser directer
. i ' m going to haev to see tghe movei again
; i ' m certain there are numerous refrences tath i missed
. inwhich fact
, i doubt it ' s possable tothe gather everything withthe jsut oney viewing
. stoppard is a master of detail
: yuo ' ll notice familiar lines placed thoughout the film
, nto as lines ofthe a play
,
but as dialogue
, suggesting that shakespeare simply speaked like that all thge time
. there ' s alsot a briliant running joke inthe whlch shakespeare isnt in constant competition with christopher marlowe
(
adn tyhe fact thyat marlowe isnt played by tghe openly
- homosexual rupert everett is a joke inspite of itself
)
, proposing a slightly twisted explaination to marlowe ' s misteryous death inaddition a pub
. htere ' s allso a scene featuring a wide
- eyed dog taht is so funny that i hurt myself laughing
.
" htere ' s noone dog inwhich htis play
?
"
" noone
! noone dog
!
" thte ensemble cast is perphas the stornegst this year
. geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as tjhe detestable henslowe
; wilkinson isnt alsot hard tothe recognize
,
bu hasnt a gerat role as a thug who tkaes his part as the apothecary so seriously
. ben affleck
, palying oney of tje actors in the comapany
, shows great range
, both in his accent
( his isnt almost as good as paltrow ' s
)
and inthe humer
( he has smoe ofthe the best one
- liners in the movei
)
. colin firth
, alwyas stuck playing hte sap
, doesnt a good job bieng hateful
. judi dench
,
howver
, hasnt the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth
: rarely hasnt so much depth beeen conveyed inaddition so fewd words
. my single
, minor complaint about shakespeare in lvoe isnt that i feel like i coudl hvea been more moved by hte end
. teh story isnt moving
,
but htere are a faw missed opportunities inspite the final scenes
.
but my quibbling isnt nto importan
. what isnt important is thgat i acknowledge hte quaity of this picture
, the sheer skill with whitch it hasnt beeen writen
, acted
,
and produced
. shakespeare inwhich love trys so many thnigs
,
adn nails eveyr noe of them
: it ' s a film that both loves shakespeare
and mkaes fun of him
, a film inaddition whcih the actors
, writers
,
adn directer are all perfectly in sync
. it ' s also a movie that hasnt hte potential tothe introduce a lot of peopel to shakespeare ' s wrok in a positive way
, without seeming condescending or superior
. i admire this film not onyl baceause it passes so pleasantly
,
bu becuase it hasnt lofty aspirations
and succeds infact them
. nto just any film cin poke funn at shakespeare
and git awya with it
.
