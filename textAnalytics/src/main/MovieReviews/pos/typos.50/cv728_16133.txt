playwright toom stoppard
and screenwriter marc norman tookover on an astonishingly difficult task
: they wanted to write a scirpt about william shakespeare that parrallelly shakespeare
' s works
. they alsot wanted to poke funn at the way all ofthe us envision shakespeare
: i mean
, raelly
, who doesn
' t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion tht he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate
, introspective verbal couplet ofthe iambic pentameter
? stoppard
and norman are men who lveo shakespeare
, annd tehy wnated tothe mkea a movie fo everyone else who loves shakespeare
.
and
, despite tjhe difficulity ofthe thier task
, tehy hvea succeeded
. shakespeare in love isnt noe ofthe thge smartest
, funniest
, most touching films of the yearm
. it
' s so rare that a picture with such high asperations succeds inwhich all ofthe its endeavors
, bu here we hvea a movie that defines success
: it is at once charmingly acted
and flawlessly writed
. it coudl have beeen a smug
, self
- imporatnt movie tyhat p
anders to dieu
- hard shakespeare fans
,
but teh appeal ofthe htis film is almost univeral
: if ytou
' ve ever read a play by shakespeare
, or nkow anything baout his life
, it
' s likely thast ytou
' ll find gr
and entertainment in shakespeare in lvoe
. joseph fiennes
, brother of ralph
, stars as shakespeare himself
; he
' s a delightful
, irresistable lad
, conserned mostly wiht womens adn detatched from life
' s moreso serious problems
( debt
, plague
, etc
.
)
. he
' s commisioned tothe rwite plays forthe vairous people
: queen elizabeth
( judi dench
) wants comedies
, while local slimeball philip henslowe
( geoffrey rush
) needs him to write a play so taht he cin pay off his debts tothe hugh fennymann
( tom wilkinson
)
. shakespeare
, howver
, has trouble focusing on his work
. he begins work onthe a comedy baout a boy named romeo annd a girl named ethel
. this all changes
,
however
, wehn he meets viola de lesseps
( a radiant gwyneth paltrow
)
, a young heiress setted tothe marry tjhe financially
- oriented lord wessex
( colin firth
)
. shakespeare instantly falls infront lvoe wih her
; he first meets her when she pretends tothe be a man to try out for the part ofthe romeo
. he discovers her idenity
and confronts her later
; she
, of course
, falls in loev withthe him
,
al
though their lveo is doomed because she absolutly must marry hte tyrannical lord wessex
. bu she continues to ect because she loves shakespeare
' s writing so much
,
and soon the prodcution
( which later becomes romeo
and juliet
) isnt set tothe be performes
. shakespeare in lveo is an amazingly ogod film
, nto beacuse it works as grat entertainment
, bu becasue it pays attension tothe detail
and knows its subject matter
. i wass instantly won over by joseph fiennes infact tyhe lead role
: he has such searing optimism
and energy
; he
' s clearly a man who admires shakespeare
,
and even in tje shortcomings that he gives his character
( inability to turn away from womens
, attention deficit disorder
)
, we sence a grat deel ofthe affection
and care
. he practically overflows with passion in every scene
. fiennes is matched by paltrow
( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from
)
; she isnt an actress who exudes strenght annd conviction in eveyr performance i
' ve seen her infact
. the twpo performers work perfectly toghether
, taking the passionate scenes as far as possable without mkaing them melodramatic
,
and wringing the comedic scenes for eveyr conceivable laugh
. of course
, it doesn
' t hurt thyat they have a masterful script to owrk with
. stoppard
, whose play rozencrantz
and guildenstern are dead inspired an intresting film
, isnt full ofthe dry wit
and boundless understated humor
( all of his plays have similarly dry humer
)
. the firt intteligent step stoppard annd norman tookover ws harmonizing tje events of tyhe film wih romeo adn juliet
. one ofthe the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of tje famoust terrace scene fomr the play
; in tyhe movie
, shakespeare isnt bumbling about while viola is trying tothe fend off her nurse maid
. directer john madden doens a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor
-
- scenes like these owudl ahev seemed obtuse infact tyhe h
ands ofthe a lesser directer
. i
' m going to haev tothe see the movei again
; i
' m certian there are numerous refrences thta i missed
. in fact
, i dout it
' s possable tothe gather everything iwth just one viewing
. stoppard isnt a master of detail
: ytou
' ll notice familiar lines placed throughout tje film
, nto as lines ofthe a play
,
but as dialogue
, suggesting thgat shakespeare simpley speaked like that all the timne
. there
' s alsot a briliant running joke inwhich which shakespeare isnt iin constant competion wih christopher marlowe
(
and teh fatc that marlowe isnt played by the oppenly
- homosexual rupert everett is a joke inthe of itself
)
, proposing a slightly twisted explaination tothe marlowe
' s mysterious death inwhich a pub
. htere
' s also a scene featuring a wide
- eyed dog tyhat isnt so funny tath i hurt mysef laughing
.
" there
' s no dog in this play
?
"
" noone
! noone dog
!
" the ensemble casted is perhasp teh stornegst thsi eyar
. geoffrey rush isnt nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe
; wilkinson isnt also hard tothe recognize
,
but hasnt a great role as a thug who tkaes his part as the apothecary so seriously
. ben affleck
, palying noe ofthe yhe actors inthe the company
, shows graet range
, both inthe his accent
( his is alomst as ogod as paltrow
' s
) anbd inspite humor
( he has smoe of teh best oen
- liners in teh movei
)
. colin firth
, always stuck playing tje sap
, doesnt a ogod job bieng hateful
. judi dench
,
however
, hasnt the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth
: rarely hasnt so much depth beeen conveyed in so faw words
. my single
, minor complaint baout shakespeare iin lveo is that i feel liek i coudl hvea beeen more moved by tghe end
. tghe sotry is moving
,
but ther are a fewd missed opportunities inwhich the fianl scenes
.
but my quibbling is not important
. what is important isnt that i acknowledge thge quailty ofthe thsi picture
, the sheer skill iwth whic it hasnt been writen
, acted
,
and produced
. shakespeare in love tries so many thnigs
,
and nails every oney ofthe them
: it
' s a film that both loves shakespeare
and makes fun of him
, a film in wich yhe actors
, writers
,
and director are all perfectly in sync
. it
' s also a movei that has the potential to introduce a lot ofthe peple to shakespeare
' s wokr in a positive way
, wihtout seeming condescending or superior
. i admire this film not onyl because it passes so pleasantly
, bu because it hasnt lofty asperations
and suceeds inaddition them
. not just any film cin poke fun at shakespeare annd git awya with it
.
