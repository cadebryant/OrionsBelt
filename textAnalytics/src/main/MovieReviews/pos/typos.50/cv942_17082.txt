it is allways refreshing tothe see a superstar acotr who gets payed moreso thna enough to foreget baout wroking fo a living tothe whant tothe take a chance anbd play a less
- thna
- savoury character as mel gibson doesnt in payback
. of course
, if i ws being paid
$ 25 million for one month
' s owrk
, i
' d probably be willing tothe take risks as well
, bu that
' s niether here nor there
. payback is based onthe a novel by richard stark
( apparently actually donald e
. westlake
, autor of teh grifters
, itself a fine crime film
) whcih wass allso filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring oen ofthe the toughest ofthe tough guys
, lee marvin
. the film opens wiht gibson haveing recovered fomr bieng shooted sevral times in the back
, by whom we don
' t nkwo
yet
. all we knwo is thgat gibson
, as porter
, isn
' t a happy chappy
and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him bcak
, annd getting even in hte proccess
, no marter whta tjhe consequences
. it turns out that tjhe man he
' s aftter is val
( gregg henry
)
, his sometime partner with whom he stoled a briefcase full ofthe cash ffrom a gang of chinese mobsters
. obviously nto hvaing much ofthe a crisis of the soul
, val figures porter isnt dead
and goes about useing his share ofthe tjhe monay to pay off a debt to his employers
. porter
, howver
, isnt the sort ofthe man who holds a grudge annd once onthe his feets
, goes about exacting revenge onthe the doublely
- crossing val
. gibson gives a terific performance infact thte sort of role which he wass born tothe play
, that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn
' t mind beating uv or shooting people to git waht he whants
. ytou probablly wouldn
' t see other actors in his salery range take such an offbeat
, outloud
- ofthe
- character role such as porter
( jim carrey won
' t be doing anything like this in a hurry after wqat happened the last timne he tried
- teh cable guy
, anyone
?
)
. harrison ford
' s idea ofthe palying an unsympathetic carachter is presumed innocent
; the last time schwarzenegger plyed a villian was batman
and robin
, which we won
' t mention futher
;
and has stallone ever realy played a villian at all
? thsi isnt not tothe say tyhat porter is a villin
, per se
. while he isn
' t thte sort of carachter yuo wouldn
' t want to get on the wrong side ofthe
, he
' s nothing compared tothe smoe ofthe the ones we are forced to watch inthe countless bad thrillers adn action films where they kill innocent peple infront yhe blink of an eye or excecute thier right
- h
and men just tothe prove how mean they are
. porter isnt only trying to get back what is nto
- so
- rightfully his
, which in a way isnt almost underst
andable
. payback isnt an enjoyable dramatic black comedy
- thriller hwihc won
' t be remembered as bieng among gibson
' s most important wokr
,
but isnt still one ofthe the finer films he
' s done
. the onyl rela probelm wtih it isnt tath
, while everything seems tothe work out in tje end
, i was left feeling something wass lacking
; ws thgat all
? the ending looks as if it wass tacked on at tyhe lastr minute
, anbd tje final voice
- over doesn
' t ring true
, even
though it wass utilizied to ogod effect elsewhere infront the film
- noir stlye the rest ofthe the film embodies
. the film jstu ends far too suddenly
, after a huge build
- uv in the penultimate scenes
. a fine film
, even
though it needs just a little something more tothe be the kind ofthe a film that cant be reccommended without hesitation
. jsut be ready forthe a possable letdown ofthe an endig
.
