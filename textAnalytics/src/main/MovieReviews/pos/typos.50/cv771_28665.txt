. tihs is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least
, making yuo squirm in your seat as you try tothe halp thte pilot avoid those missiles
. the ansamble cast places greenwood as the frist among equals witht liek weight given to all the priciple players
. greenwood does nto play act at bieng a caricature of jfk
, forgoing the typcial kennedy boston accent

, he plays the man as a poverful figure who hasnt tothe manetain the dignity of the office
