' t thge obvious best of actors
, bu dillon doesnt give a convincing performance
. howver

, still hot off the press from starship troopers
, gives the most intresting performance in tghe entire film

. still
, teh film doesn
' t seem tothe gain much from bacon

andra van ryan
, daphne rubin
- vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez
, anbd bill murray shines as sam
' s lawyer
, ken bowden
. hats off tothe murray for adding thge perfect touch ofthe comedy tothe tjhe film
. all
though wild things wass displayed by the press as bieng an erotic thriller
, the eroticism
, which is protrayed iwth ogod taste
, isnt kept tothe a minumum annd focuses mroe onthe thge plot anbd the relationships beween the characters
. this isnt truley a very ogod film worth seing if your looking fo a movei wih a thick plot filled with it
' s share ofthe twists
