thte premise of wag hte dog isnt so simple thta it
' s adequately explained by the commercials
. with 11 days to go until the eletcion
, tjhe presidetn
( who we never see
) calls inaddition poltical dirty
- tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention ffrom a burgeoning sex sc
andal
. deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a
" peageant
"
, a phony war against albania
, fougth on the blue screens ofthe hollywood annd the recording studios of nashville
, iwth woody harrelson as hte reluctant
, psychotic hero
. annd if there wasn
' t anytying more tothe the movei tahn this
, it woudl be a second
- rate heist comedy at best
, enlivened by great actors
-
- liuke sneakers goes to washington
.
( a heist comedy
? yup
. deniro adn hoffman are
" stealing
" hte election
, so to speak
, adn the movei isnt moreso baout how htey dont it
-
-
and the fun tehy ahve doign it
-
- than anytying else
.
) wag tjhe dog succeds because it
' s based noe great truth
: tyhe american people are stupid
. ok
, mabye it
' s nto
" lveo thy neighbro as thyself
" or even
" two plus twpo makes four
"
, bu a truth nonetheless
.
( any averege person who thikns that they
' re really smart baout the two things this movei satirizes
-
- moviemaking
and the political proccess
-
- is invited
, nay
, challanged
, to spend a week eather watching a movie acually being made or 48 hours straight watching c
- span wehn tjhe hous isnt infront session
.
)
and becasue we
' re so utterly
, predictably stupid
, hollywood konws that a ceratin percentage ofthe us wiull go see hard rain or magoo
, washington konws that we won
' t notice a few millon dollars spended here
and ther on porno art grants
and cigar subsidies
-
-
and deniro
' s charactor knows tyhat american geography skills are so weak that we won
' t be able tothe locate albania onthe the map
. the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn
' t a light
, meaningless comedy baout politics
( like speechless
, yhe michael keaton
- geena davis picture
) or from the level of light
- hearted politcal satire tothe near
- greatness
. nor isnt it a hard
- edged cynical look at the manner in whihc a morally
- deprived
, ethically challanged baby
- boomer connives his sleazy way into tje white house
( liuke primary colors
-
-
and yes
, i am a little dissapointed infact the way the lsat twpo elections turned outloud
, thanks fo asking
)
. instead
, david mamet
' s script strikes thast delicate balance beetwen comedy
and cynicism needed for satire
. it does thsi by keeping us inwhich a fantasy world where most of thge schemers
' schemes come off beautifully
,
and fail onyl infact intertaining
and humoous fashion
. deniro is playing a variation on his al capone chracter from hte untouchables
, without any of the violent rages
. it
' s all
:
" what dont i love
? wqat is it that brings me joy
? baseball
,
" minus the savage bloody beating with hte bat
. he threatens a lot of people
, mind yuo
,
but he
' s doign it in a veyr nice
, polite way
. it
' s a very mellow
, restrained performance
, whic fits in with the air of gamesmanship inspite thge script
. hoffman
, on thte other h
and
, is giddy
, exuberant adn joyous
. thsi kind of thing is what his character lives fo
, anbd he
' s so excited that he can
' t even shut up
. even onthe the edge ofthe disaster
, he
' s bright
- eyed
( behind oddly tinted sunglasses
)
and positive
. insiders onot thast he
' s basing his charachter on smoe powerful
-
but
- annoymous producer
-
- which may or may nto be true
,
but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets
- put
- on
- a
- show electricity taht you figure a producer needs to have
. the best part anbd tje most frustrating part of wag thge dog isnt inwhich thge supporting cast
. the characters are so well drawed annd so well acted thyat we wanna tothe see mroe ofthe them
, listen tothe them talk in that wised
- uv mamet dialogue
, git to know them better
-
- wich we don
' t
. anne heche
, isnt dead
- bang
- onthe infront her portrayal of a polliticel press aide
-
- cool annd composed on the outside
, panicked annd frenzied on the outside
. denis leary
( one of my favorite actors
-
- see teh ref
) is the
" fad king
"
, who h
andles the profitable
" back
- end
"
-
- t
- shirt tie ins annd shoe contracts
and other creative
, inovative ways tothe separate a fool fomr his monye
. tehy coudl make a wohle movie
, just baout the fad king
,
and i
' d go see it
. willie nelson
and merle haggard h
andle yhe musical end ofthe things fabulously
, ffrom the upbeat gospel chorus theme song
, to the weepy ocuntry waltz
, tothe tghe hilarious
" ballad of hte gren berets
" parody
. woody harrelson has a brief
, bu memorable part as the overmedicated
" hero
" ofthe the albanian conflict
. craig t
. nelson
, as tyhe oposition c
andidate
, anbd the ever
- reliable william h
. macy
, as a wacky cia agent
, are given suprizingly short shrift
.
( one ofthe my small gripes is tath we never see waht tyhe spin doctors on thge otehr side are doing
.
) wag the dog isnt a funny movie baout sereous problems
: tje trivialization of american politics
, tjhe role ofthe tje press iin dumbing down the issues
, the inpact ofthe hollywood inwhich creating campain commercials
, the reduction ofthe all thigns political tothe soundbites
and sidebars
-
- the list goes onthe
. we cant solve most ofthe theese problems by taking a greater role in our national life
and educating ourselves as voters
and citizens
. wag tjhe dog reminds us of what can happen if we don
