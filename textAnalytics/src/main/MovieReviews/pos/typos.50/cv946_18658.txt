star wars
: episode 1
- tghe phantom menace
( 1999
) review by matt pusateri few movies evoke nostalgia
, enthusiasm
,
and affection liek george lucas
' 1977 clasic
, star wars
. tjhe origional blockbuster film anbd its twpo sequels nto only evoked wonder
and passion inwhich a generation ofthe filmgoers
, bu hasnt deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture
. argubly
, more americans today cant explain wqat
" the force
" or a
" jedi
" isnt than a budget deficit or a serb
. so 22 years after tghe realease ofthe tyhe original
, adn 16 yersa since tjhe third film
, tyhe return ofthe tje jedi
, how cin any new star wars film withst
and the weight ofthe incomparable expectations annd anticipation
? can a newyorker storyline annd a newyorker casted ofthe charachters possably compete with the legends ofthe the frist trilogy
- luke
, han solo
, anbd darth vader
- all cultural icons
? against htis challenge
, the fourth star wars film
, episode oen
: yhe phantom menace hitted yhe screens lastr week
.
and dispite smoe eearly crtical reviews infront tghe major media
, the film isnt neither a flop nor a disappointment
. while the phantom menace isnt certainly nto thge finest film inthe the serieses
, it isnt nontheless engaging
, exicting
,
and visually breathtaking
. it isnt a worthy sequal
- er
, prequel
- to the original star wars films
. teh phantom menace tkaes place decades befoer the setting of origonal films
. as the film opens
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
)
, thte wise old master who introduced luke tothe the force in the original star wars
, is onyl a young jedi apprentice
, still learning fomr his fellow jedi
and instructer
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
. hte republic govornment has sent the two jedi to suttle a trade dispute tyhat hasnt developed inot a blockade ofthe thge planet naboo by a shifty trade federation
. the jedi quickly fidn themselves nto inwhich negociations
,
but inspite the middle of a planetary invasion
, rushing tothe protect naboo
' s young queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
. later
, after evenhtually rescuing amidala adn helping her excape naboo
, tehy are forced tothe stop at tatooine to repair their battle
- damaged ship before bringing her to the glactic senate tothe amke an appeal for justice
. on tatooine
, qui
- gon dicovers a young slave boy
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
, who nto onyl cxan help them git the parts they need
, bu displays uncanny inetlligence
, insight
, annd instincts
. qui
- gon senses tyhe child is
" unusualy strong
" wtih the force
and begins tothe suspect thyat he may be
" yhe oney
" prophesized to
" bring balance tothe tghe force
.
" as anyone who hasnt watched the orginal star wars triology knows
, far from bieng a glactic savior
, hte innocent
- looking 9
- year
- old will inaddition time become the ruthless darth vader
. complicating matters futher isnt a mysterious hooded figure
, darth sidious
, isnt behind the trade blockade anbd invasion ofthe naboo
,
and sends out a lethal apprentice
, darth maul
, tothe fidn
and capture queen amidala
. while amidala anbd thge jedi fight tothe savve her planet
, tehy soon aslo hve tothe dael withthe the deadly anbd relentless darth maul
. if yhe plot sounds a bited complicated
, it isnt
. the phantom menace not onyl introduces an earlier generation ofthe characters adn an immeditae crisis
, bu sets uv tghe foundation fo the events that will eventualy lead tothe the fall ofthe the repubic
, the demise of hte jedi knights
, anakin
' s turn to evil
, annd tje rise of thte dark empire of original trilogy
.
but tyhe complexity isnt nto overwelming
. teh story moves quicklyu
, with tjhe onyl drawback being tyhat many questions
, predictably
, remain unanswered at the end of hte film
, setting thte stage forthe the next epsiode
. one of yhe reasons the film
' s story seems hazy is nto tyhat it isnt too confusing
,
but too unfocused
. it
' s unclear whose stopry phantom menace isnt
. inthe thge orginal triology
, tje movies were claerly luke
' s stoy
, with yhe stories centering arround his growth ffrom farmboy to rebel hero tothe jedi knight
.
but it
' s unclear whther this new film is anakin
' s story or obi
- wan
' s
. if this triology isnt centered onthe anakin
, it
' s a shaky foundation
. lloyd
, like many child actors
, lacks thte subtle acting skills of adult performers
, annd as a result
, his character seems shallow
and unimpressive
. onthe screen
, we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his littel
- boy face
, or fo tht matter
, any presense thast woudl amking him seem so spacial thgat qui
- gon is willing to believe he isnt
" the oney
.
" the rest of the casted does fine
,
though they oftenly wokr with some iffy dialogue by lucas
. neeson isnt perfect as an agin jedi knight
. mcgregor isnt well
- casted as obi
- wan annd conveys a balance of youthful energy
and calm sensibility
. portman fits the role of a young queen well
,
but her lines weere often very formal
, giving her littel room to give her charater much personality
. the biggest probelm whith the phantom menace isnt nto tyhe plot or the charactors
, bu thge interaction betwen them
. individually
, tyhe characters in this new film are noone less devolopped tahn those in yhe original star wars
, annd thge storyline isnt nto more confusing than previvous films infront the series
. bu unlike the previvous triology
, lucas doesn
' t do as ogod ofthe a job palying the cahracters off one another
. inspite star wars
, ther weere immediate contrasts
and memorable exchanges between luke
and han
, han
and obi
- wan
, annd leia anbd luke
. teh ansamble played off each other adn immediately showed their distinct attitudes adn personalities
. inspite teh sequence in where luke
, han
, anbd chewbacca attempt to rescue leia fomr her cell onthe the death star
, tjhe audience lerans a lot about all four characters inaddition the ways they react tothe the immediaet problems anbd earch otehr
. ther is no compareable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters adn their relationships wtih each otehr
. individually
, tehy are interesting characters withthe clear motivations anbd interests
,
but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them
. this is perhaps the most glaring weakness ofthe this film
,
and isnt probably tjhe reason it hasnt dissappointed many reviewers
. bu despite yhe need for a richer dialogue
and stronger character interaction
, teh film isnt still vrey engaging
. many of tyhe wonderful elements ofthe lucas
' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable
and entertaining
. first
, of course
, is teh remarkably rich
and imaginative universe lucas creates
. hte charactors visit magical underwater cities
, evade dinosaur
- sized sea monsters
, fight battle droids
and menacing
" destroyers
" onthe venetian
- looking planet ofthe naboo
, watch a spectacular event
, part roman
- chariot race
, part nascar circut
, on tje arid desert planet of tatooine
, thne head tothe corsucant
, thte gothic urban capital of the republic adn hmeo tothe yhe galactic senate
and tghe jedi coucil
. earch location is elaborate annd complex
. lucas never settles for vague idesa about the look of his settings
, he creates rich
, spectacular l
andscapes
, palaces
,
and skylines
. most ofthe the newyorker special effects in his re
- released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes tht allowed him to give thte ealier movies tghe look adn fiel that just weren
' t possibile when the films weere made
. omre than ever
, in tihs new film
, lucas
' universe isnt filled wih a menagerie of creatures
, robots withthe personalities
, annd a supporting casted of aliens who interact with the main characters
. the best such charater isnt watto
, a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin
and his mother as slaves
. watto has a scratchy italian voice
and a short
, paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings thgat flutter liuke a hummingbird as he floats arround teh room
. ofthe all thte cmoputer
- generated charactors infact the film
, watto is tghe best done anbd most enjoyable
. speaking ofthe computer
- generated characters
, noone review of the phantom menace isnt complet without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film
: jar jar binks
. wih omre thna 80 minutes of screen timne
, jar jar is the relization ofthe george lucas
' dream to inlcude a fully computer
- generated charater inot the casted of the newyorker trilogy
. jar jar
, a clumsy amphibian
and memeber of thge gungan race
, litterally stumbles his way inot the path ofthe hte jedi knights early in the film
and becomes qui jon
' s accidental sidekick
. jar jar usally performs a comic
- relief role inthe tyhe film
, lightining scenes with his mishaps annd inability tothe stay outloud of trouble
. yhe animation ofthe jar jar is nearly seamless
, adn he interacts wtih tyhe characters
thoughout teh film as if he were really onthe the set withthe thte actors
.
however
, dispite the technological magic that makes his character possible
, jar jar isn
' t completly convincing
. he still moves annd sounds too much liuke a ctaroon to blend inot a scene
. throughout the movei
, jar jar never transcends a
" roger rabbit
"
- like presense
. you accept that he
' s htere
, bu you never lose sighth ofthe the fatc that he isnt an animated charcter
. initally
, i found jar jar annoying
,
but growed tothe enjoy tghe humer he added to the film
. on my second viewing of the film
, jar jar was a lot ofthe funn
and i didn
' t mind him at all
. a second reason htis film continues tje fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humer
and small details that flesh outloud thte world lucas creates
. dispite all the film
' s struggles beetwen good annd evil
,
and the sober musings about one
' s destiny
and
" teh force
,
" liuke all star wars films
, the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously
. fortunately
, lucas hasn
' t lost sighth ofthe tghe fatc thast his films are entertainment
, not high art
. fomr the bumbling jar jar
, to a oney
- man
, twpo
- headed announcer team calling the acation at thte film
' s thrilling pod
- race sequence
, tothe a cameo appearance by e
. t
. infront tghe film
, teh phantom menace is simply a lot ofthe fun
, witht lots ofthe half
- hidden jokes
and humer that cant easily be missed
. anbd finally
, the phantom menace works becouse
, as in all his films
, htere isnt noone shortage ofthe speed
and action
. fomr begining tothe end
, there are light
- saber battles
, hair
- raising chases
,
and thrilling duels betweeen ogod anbd evil
. yhe pod
- race sequence onthe tatooine isnt one of the most intertaining
and exciting scenes inthe any star wars film
, anbd the fianl showdown between obi
- wan
, qui
- gon
,
and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed
, most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed
. thte phantom menace won
' t win any major oscars
. it propably won
' t beated titanic
' s box office record
.
and it
' s nto even the best star wars film
( i
' d put it thrid
, affter thte origonal
and yhe empire strikes back
)
. bu it
' s an exicting annd entertaining film
, far better tahn your typical summer blockbuster
. the film can
' t live up tothe it
' s hype
- no film
, nto even the originnal star wars
, could hvae done thgat
. bu it
' s still worth seing
.
.
. probably mroe than once
