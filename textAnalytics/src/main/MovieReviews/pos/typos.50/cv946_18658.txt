star wars
: epsiode 1
- tyhe phantom menace
( 1999
) review by matt pusateri few movies envoke nostalgia
, enthusiasm
,
and affection like george lucas ' 1977 classic
, star wars
. tje original blockbuster film
annd its twpo sequels nto onyl evoked wonder
anbd passion in a generation of filmgoers
,
bu has deeply entrenched itself infront american pop culture
. arguably
, moreso americans today cant expalin what
" hte force
" or a
" jedi
" is than a budget defecit or a serb
. so 22 yeras aftter thge release ofthe the orginal
,
and 16 yeasr since the thrid film
, thte return ofthe tje jedi
, how can any new star wars film withstand tghe weight ofthe incomparable expectations
adn anticipation
? cxan a new storyline
annd a new cast ofthe charactors possably compeat with the legends ofthe the first trilogy
- luke
, han solo
,
and darth vader
- all cultural icons
? against this challenge
, the fourth star wars film
, epiode one
: the phantom menace hitted the screens lsat week
.
and dispite some early crtical reviews in the major media
, the film is neither a flop nor a dissapointment
. hwile the phantom menace isnt certainly nto the finest film inspite the sories
, it isnt nontheless engaging
, exicting
,
annd visually breathtaking
. it is a worthy sequel
- er
, prequel
- tothe hte original star wars films
. teh phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films
. as tje film opens
, obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
)
, tyhe wise old master who introduced luke to the force in tjhe original star wars
, is only a young jedi apprentice
, still learning fomr his fellow jedi
annd instructor
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
)
. the republic government has sent yhe twpo jedi to suttle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of tyhe planet naboo by a shifty trade federation
. thge jedi quicklyu find themselfs not inthe negociations
,
but in the middle ofthe a planetary invasion
, rushing to protect naboo ' s young queen amidala
( natalie portman
)
. later
, aftter eventally rescuing amidala
anbd helping her escape naboo
, they are forced tothe stpo at tatooine to repair their battle
- damaged ship befoer bringing her tothe tjhe galactic senate tothe mkea an appeal forthe justice
. on tatooine
, qui
- gon discovers a young slave boy
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
, who nto onyl cin halp them git teh parts they need
,
bu displays uncanny intelliegnce
, insight
,
anbd instincts
. qui
- gon senses tjhe child isnt
" unusualy storng
" witht tjhe force
anbd begins to suspect that he may be
" teh noe
" prophesized to
" bring balance to the force
.
" as anyone who has watched the original star wars triology knows
, far fomr bieng a galactic savior
, tjhe innocent
- looking 9
- yera
- old wiull inwhich timne become hte ruthless darth vader
. complicating matters further is a misterious hooded figure
, darth sidious
, is behind teh trade blockade
and invasion of naboo
,
and sends outloud a lethal apprentice
, darth maul
, tothe fidn
adn capture queen amidala
. while amidala
anbd tyhe jedi fight tothe savve her planet
, tehy soon allso haev tothe deal wtih the deadly
anbd relentless darth maul
. if tghe plot sounds a bit complicated
, it isnt
. thte phantom menace nto onyl introduces an earlier generation of characters
and an immediate crisis
,
but sets up tjhe foundation for the events that will evenhtually lead to the fall ofthe the repubic
, the demise of yhe jedi knights
, anakin ' s turn to evil
,
annd the rise ofthe tje dark empire ofthe original triology
.
bu the complexity isnt not overwhelming
. yhe story moves quickly
, wtih thte onyl drawback bieng that many questions
, predictably
, remain unanswered at hte end ofthe tje film
, setting hte stage forthe thge enxt episode
. noe of tyhe reasons the film ' s sotry seems hazy isnt not that it is too confusing
,
but too unfocused
. it ' s unclear whose story phantom menace is
. in teh original trilogy
, the movies weere clearly luke ' s story
, with yhe tsories centering around his growth from farmboy tothe rebel hero to jedi knight
.
bu it ' s unclear whether tihs new film isnt anakin ' s stoy or obi
- wan ' s
. if this trilogy is centered on anakin
, it ' s a shaky foundation
. lloyd
, liek many child actors
, lacks the subtle acting skills ofthe adult performers
,
adn as a result
, his charachter seems shallow
and unimpressive
. onthe screen
, we see nothing thyat suggests a dark side lurking underneath his littel
- boy face
, or forthe that matter
, any presence tath would make him seem so special that qui
- gon is willing tothe elieve he isnt
" the oney
.
" teh rest ofthe tghe cast doesnt fine
,
though htey often wrok whith smoe iffy dialogue by lucas
. neeson isnt perfect as an agin jedi knight
. mcgregor isnt well
- casted as obi
- wan
adn conveys a balance ofthe youthful energy
and calm sensibility
. portman fits tghe role ofthe a young queen well
,
but her lines weere oftenly veyr formall
, giving her little room tothe give her charater much perosnality
. tje biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters
,
bu the interaction between them
. individually
, thge characters in htis new film are noone less developed than those in tjhe original star wars
,
annd the storyline is nto moreso confusing than previvous films in tghe series
.
bu unlike tje previous triology
, lucas doesn ' t dont as ogod of a job palying the characters off oney another
. in star wars
, there were immedate contrasts
adn memorable exchanges between luke
anbd han
, han
and obi
- wan
,
adn leia
and luke
. the ansamble plyed off earch other
anbd immediatly showed thier distinct attitudes
and personalities
. in tyhe sequence in where luke
, han
,
and chewbacca attempt to rescure leia from her cell onthe the death star
, tyhe audeince learns a lot about all four characters inspite tyhe ways they react to thge immediate problems
and each otehr
. htere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace tothe flesh outloud the cahracters
and their relationships with eahc otehr
. individualy
, they are intresting charachters with clear motivations
adn interests
,
bu lucas develops little chemistry or tension between hte them
. this isnt perhaps tghe most glaring weakness of this film
,
and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers
.
bu dispite the need for a richer dialogue
annd stronger character interaction
, thge film is still vrey engaging
. many of the wonderfull elements ofthe lucas ' previous films amke the phantom menace both memorable
adn entertaining
. first
, ofthe course
, is the remarkably rich
and imaginative universe lucas creates
. tghe characters visi magical underwater cities
, evade dinosaur
- sized sea monsters
, fight battle droids
adn menacing
" destroyers
" onthe venetian
- looking planet ofthe naboo
, watch a spectacular event
, part roman
- chariot race
, part nascar circuit
, on teh arid dezert planet of tatooine
,
then head tothe corsucant
, the gothic urban captial ofthe yhe republic
and home to tghe glactic senate
and teh jedi coucil
. each location is elaborite
and complex
. lucas never settles for vague idaes about the look ofthe his settings
, he creates rich
, spectacular landscapes
, palaces
,
and skylines
. most ofthe the newyorker special effects in his re
- released special edition triology in 1997 were changes tath alloween him to give the ealier movies the look
and feel that jstu weren ' t possibile whn thge films weere made
. more thna ever
, infront this newyorker film
, lucas ' universe is filled wiht a menagerie ofthe creatures
, robots with personalities
,
and a supporting cast of aliens who interact wiht the main charactors
. hte best such character is watto
, a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin
and his mother as slaves
. watto has a scratchy italian voice
and a short
, paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings tath flutter like a hummingbird as he floats arund tyhe room
. of all tyhe coputer
- generated charactors inaddition the film
, watto is the best done
annd most enjoyable
. speaking of computer
- generated charachters
, no review of hte phantom menace isnt complete wihtout mentioning yhe most contravercial figure infront the film
: jar jar binks
. with more than 80 mintues ofthe screen timne
, jar jar isnt teh relization ofthe george lucas ' dream to include a fully computer
- generated character into the cast of hte new trilogy
. jar jar
, a clumsy amphibian
anbd member of the gungan race
, litterally stumbles his way into the path ofthe the jedi knights early in the film
and becomes qui jon ' s accidental sidekick
. jar jar ususally performs a comic
- relief role inwhich the film
, lightening scenes with his mishaps
annd inability tothe stay out ofthe trouble
. the animation ofthe jar jar is nearly seamless
,
and he interacts with the characters througout the film as if he were realy on the set with tje actors
.
howver
, dispite teh technological magic tath makse his character possable
, jar jar isn ' t completely convincing
. he still moves
adn soudns too much like a ctaroon to blend into a scene
. throughout the movei
, jar jar never transcends a
" roger rabbit
"
- liuke presence
. you accept that he ' s there
,
but you never loose sight of the fact that he is an animated charcter
. initially
, i found jar jar annoying
,
but growed tothe enjoy the humor he added tothe yhe film
. on my second viewing of teh film
, jar jar was a lot ofthe funn
and i didn ' t mind him at all
. a second reason tihs film continues tghe fine tradition of star wars movies isnt thgat yhe film is replete iwth humer
and small details that flesh out tje world lucas creates
. dispite all hte film ' s struggles vetween good
and evil
,
anbd thte sober musings baout oney ' s destiny
anbd
" tje force
,
" liuke all star wars films
, tjhe phantom menace never takes itself too seriously
. fortunately
, lucas hasn ' t lost sighth ofthe the fact thgat his films are enteratinment
, nto high art
. from thge bumbling jar jar
, to a oen
- man
, two
- headed announcer team calling tjhe acation at yhe film ' s thrilling pod
- race sequence
, to a cameo apperance by e
. t
. inaddition the film
, tghe phantom menace isnt simply a lot of fun
, with lots of half
- hidden jokes
and humor tht cant easily be missed
.
and fianlly
, the phantom menace works baceause
, as inaddition all his films
, there is noone shortage of speed
and acation
. ffrom beginning to end
, htere are glight
- saber battles
, hair
- raising chases
,
and thrilling duels beetwen ogod
and evil
. the pod
- race sequence onthe tatooine is oen ofthe tghe most intertaining
and exicting scenes in any star wars film
,
and tjhe fianl showdown between obi
- wan
, qui
- gon
,
and darth maul is argubly tje best choreographed
, most thrilling fight sequence lucas hasnt filmed
. the phantom menace won ' t win any major oscars
. it probablly won ' t beated titanic ' s box office record
.
annd it ' s not even the best star wars film
( i ' d put it thrid
, after thte original
and tjhe empire strikes back
)
.
bu it ' s an exicting
anbd entertaining film
, far better tahn your typical summer blockbuster
. the film can ' t live up to it ' s hype
- noone film
, not even thte orignal star wars
, sould hve done that
.
bu it ' s still worth seeing
.
.
. probably more thna once
.
