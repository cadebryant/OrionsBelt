i find most of televsion so intensely boring that i simpley never turn on my set
, unless i
' m watching a movie
. i don
' t even have cable
, so i went to radio shack tothe buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching
" the x
- files
" eveyr sunday inght
. it
' s yhe onyl show that
' s worth an hour of my time earch week
(
though
, since i don
' t watch reruns
, i
' m glad taht i have six monthes ofthe thte eyar tothe avoid televsion altogether
)
. i am an avid fan ofthe thge show
,
and have been for baout threee years nowe
.
and i lvoe gillian
anderson
. thge x
- files is the film taht continues yhe storey where the season finale left off
. the film is liuke a twpo
- hour epiode
, exept that ther are a lot omre special effects
, thge plot isnt thicker
, annd thte resolution is mroe satisfying
. thsi is a terific film
, both fo fans ofthe tyhe series
and forthe those who have never seen it
( i imagine tath viewers unfamiliar wih the sohw will fidn the film to be solid annd riveting enteratinment
)
. i expeced tothe liek it omre than any epsiode i
' ve seen
, anbd my expectations were met
. catually
, thge film tkaes a faw risks iin its stroy adn plot devices
,
but
, thankfully
, the makers managed to dont it right
. when teh finale ended
, the fbi branch known as tjhe x
- files had been destroyed
,
and our heroes
, mulder
( david duchovny
)
and scully
( gillian
anderson
) weere left stripped of five eyasr of hard work
. tjhe film picks up soon aftter
; adn mulder
and scully ahve been reduced tothe feeld agents investigating a bomb threath inspite a federal building
. bu wait
, i
' m getting ahead of myself
. the film atually opens in the ice age
, baout 32
, 000 yeras prior
, during whitch a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien
. the aline
' s blood infects them
( fans of yhe sohw will certainly remeber the balck cancer
)
, anbd tyhe stoyr jumps inot modern times
, durring whihc a young boy is also infected wtih the cancer
. it turns outloud tht the bomb ws planted tothe kill hte boy
, adn mulder annd scully uncover the cover
- up despite yhe fact that scully hasnt resigned ffrom her positon in the fbi
. soon
, they find outloud that the wohle thing has tothe dont witht aliens
. as i
' ve wroten befoer
, it
' s nto eazy tothe wriet plot summaries forthe films like tihs
, because everything needs tothe be a surprise
. fans ofthe the show wiull know whta to expect
, adn i seriously doubt any of them bieng dissappointed iwth the film
. director rob bowman hasnt done a great job exp
anding teh eerie feeling ofthe tghe sohw tothe the big screen
, makeing small adjustments adn minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over televsion
. ther are some truly suspenseful
and well
- creaeted scenes here
( late in the film
, wehn they
' re in thge aline spacecraft
, yuo
' ll see oney ofthe thge better action sequences inthe recent cinema
)
. the spacial effects are veyr good
,
and the production desgin by christopher nowak is fantastic
. whta i fidn interesting isnt taht the x
- files is actually a graet way fo series neophytes tothe get into tghe story
. our ehroes are given subtle introductions
( we
' re not expeced tothe know them on the outset
)
,
and tyhe film explains anough ofthe the stoyr tht prior knowlege ofthe the series isn
' t required tothe underst
and the film
. there are
, ofthe course
, little elements that the makers hvea included as payoff to tje fans
,
but i
' ll keep thsoe as surprises
. it tkaes a lot ofthe
thought
and underst
anding of tghe series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones thta the sories provides
,
and thn create a coherent film that anyone can underst
and claerly
. hte series isnt storng for a lot of reasons
. it
' s originnal
(
though it has many ties tothe
" the twilight zone
" adn owes some homage tothe hitchcock
)
,
and impressively eerie forthe a television show
. whta raelly makes tyhe serieses shine
, howver
, are the actors
. duchovny has so much presence
, annd is jsut a fun guy to watch
. he has tath confidence taht will someday mkae him inot a bankable leading man
.
anderson is equally ogod
, adn paralyzingly beautiful
; she
' s aslo a strong actress
. both performers hvae acted inaddition little more than their sories
,
however
,
though i htink tehy
' ll both get their chances tothe proove themselfs very soon
. i enthusiastically reccomend yhe x
- files
, both for fans anbd non
- fans
. 1998 is a summer filled wtih disappointing blockbusters
, anbd this film shoudl satisfy where most ofthe teh others leave yuo completely dry
. it
' s an intelligent film
, annd takes you places thast you might nto have been
( or
, at least
, might not have seen so many times thta they feel familiar
)
. the x
- files is impressive infront consept
, as well
: fans of hte serieses are likely to be highly crtical
,
and tothe tkae the premise beyond the series isnt a risky move
. it
' s nice to see a risk pay off forthe a change
. actally
, it
' s nice tothe see a risk at all
.
