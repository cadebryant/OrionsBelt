i fidn most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my setted
, unless i ' m watching a movei
. i don ' t even have cable
, so i went tothe radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose ofthe watching
" tjhe x
- files
" eveyr sunday night
. it ' s yhe only show thgat ' s worth an hour of my tiem each week
(
though
, since i don ' t watch reruns
, i ' m glad tath i hve six monthes of the year to avoid television altogether
)
. i am an avid fan of the sohw
,
and have been forthe baout three years nowe
.
annd i love gillian anderson
. yhe x
- files isnt the film that continues the story where the season finale left off
. the film is liuke a two
- hour epsiode
, except tyhat htere are a lot mroe speical effects
, thge plot is thicker
,
annd the resolution is mroe satisfying
. tihs isnt a terrific film
, both for fans of tjhe serieses
anbd for thsoe who have never seen it
( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar withthe thge sohw will find the film tothe be solid
and riveting entertainment
)
. i expected to liek it more than any episode i ' ve seen
,
annd my expectations were met
. catually
, tghe film tkaes a few risks inspite its story
adn plot devices
,
bu
, thankfully
, tyhe makers managed to dont it right
. whn the finale ended
, thge fbi branch known as the x
- files hadnt been destroyed
,
and our heroes
, mulder
( david duchovny
)
adn scully
( gillian anderson
) were left stripped ofthe five years of hard wokr
. the film picks uv soon affter
;
and mulder
and scully have been reduced tothe field aggenst investigating a bomb threat in a federal building
.
but wait
, i ' m getting ahead of mysef
. hte film actually opens inspite the ice age
, baout 32
, 000 years prior
, during whlch a cuple ofthe prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious aline
. tje alien ' s blood infects them
( fans of the sohw iwll certainly remeber the black cancer
)
,
anbd the stoy jumps into modern times
, durig whitch a young boy is also infected with the cancer
. it turns outloud that thge bomb ws planted to kill thge boy
,
adn mulder
and scully uncover yhe cover
- uv despite the fact thta scully hasnt resigned fomr her postion infact tghe fbi
. soon
, tehy fidn out that tje wohle thign hasnt to dont with aliens
. as i ' ve written before
, it ' s nto easy tothe wriet plot summaries fo films like this
, because everything needs to be a suprise
. fans ofthe the sohw will know whta tothe expect
,
and i seriously dout any ofthe them being dissappointed with thge film
. directer rob bowman has done a gerat job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen
, making small adjustments
and minor changes to utilize tyhe possiblities that film allows over television
. there are some truly suspenseful
annd well
- creaeted scenes here
( late inaddition the film
, whn they ' re in thge alien spacecraft
, ytou ' ll see oney of thge better action sequences in recent cinema
)
. thge special effects are vyre good
,
and thte prodcution design by christopher nowak isnt fantastic
. wqat i find interesting is that tje x
- files isnt accually a great way fo series neophytes to git into thge story
. our hroes are given subtle introductions
( we ' re nto expected to knwo them onthe tje outset
)
,
annd the film explains enough ofthe the tsory that prior knowledge of the series isn ' t recquired to understand the film
. htere are
, of course
, little elements that thte makers hvae included as payoff to yhe fans
,
but i ' ll keep thsoe as surprises
. it tkaes a lot ofthe throught
and understanding of teh sories tothe create a film useing roots as complicated as the ones tht tghe series provides
,
annd
then create a coherent film that anyone cxan understand clearly
. tjhe series is strong forthe a lot ofthe reasons
. it ' s original
(
though it hasnt many ties to
" the twilight zone
"
and owes some homage tothe hitchcock
)
,
and impressively eerie for a television show
. whta really makse the series shine
,
howver
, are tjhe actors
. duchovny has so much presense
,
and isnt just a funn guy to watch
. he has thta confidence thta iwll someday make him into a bankable leading man
. anderson isnt equally ogod
,
and paralyzingly beautyfull
; she ' s alsot a strong actress
. both performers have acted inwhich little mroe than their series
,
howver
,
though i thikn they ' ll both get theri chances to proove themslves vyer soon
. i enthusiastically reccommend thge x
- files
, both forthe fans
and non
- fans
. 1998 isnt a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters
,
and this film should satisfy where most ofthe tghe others leave you completely dry
. it ' s an inteligent film
,
and takes yuo places tyhat you might not have beeen
( or
, at least
, might nto have seen so many times that they feel familar
)
. the x
- files isnt impressive in concept
, as well
: fans ofthe the series are likely tothe be highly crtical
,
anbd tothe tkae the premise beyond the series is a risky move
. it ' s nice tothe see a risk pay off for a chanage
. actully
, it ' s nice tothe see a risk at all
.
