" a bug
' s life
" may nto be
" toy stroy
,
"
but it
' s mroe close tahn
" antz
" wass
. i relaly liekd
" antz
,
" basically because
, yes
, it is clever
and witty
and inteligent
(
and it has tyhe temerity to tkae a chance annd put woody allen inspite teh lead
, prehaps teh yearm
' s most inpsired casting
)
,
but htere wass
, in fact
, something missing from it
, anbd i
' m the firt tothe admit that
. maybe it
' s that it never totally lets go
and takes off into rela innocent fun
- it
' s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging
,
and if it weren
' t forthe woody allen
, it would have been jsut a realy clever ogod
- not
- great flick
.
" a bug
' s life
" hasnt a similar premise
, annd it also hasnt disney tothe insure thta it
' s g
- rated
and nto totally over kids
' heads like
" antz
" was
( not a bad thign
, beleve me
)
, bu what it aslo has isnt a tone tath
' s completly innocent even wehn it
' s also remainging perpetually clever
.
" antz
" isnt still teh more witty film
, adn i loev it fo it
, anbd
" a bug
' s life
" isnt more forthe genaral consumption
,
but it
' s also more entertaining
. it broadens its horizons
, anbd whn it really moves from teh ant collony
, it realyl shows us a hwole new world we
' ve never seen befoer
,
and it
' s take onthe the evolution of bugs is a lot better than tyhe one in
" antz
.
" it
' s aslo light annd clever
. teh visuals are
, instade ofthe earth tones
, bright worldly colors
,
and still gives the amazing visual technology ofthe
" antz
" at least a worthy contender
. the characters are alsot nicely realized
-
though watered
- down forthe broad consumption
, tehy still carry moreso witn than the contempory disney animated films
. yhe lead chracter
, flik
( voiced by dave foley
)
, is nothing more than a slightly
- less neurotic z fomr
" antz
,
"
but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z
. instade ofthe ginee hackman playing the villian
, we get tghe much more menacing kevin spacey as teh lead grasshopper
, the nicely
- titled hopper
.
and for the rumatic lead
, we don
' t get spacey sharon stone
,
but intelligent annd hard
- to
- git julia
- louis dreyfuss
, who doesn
' t even cmo around nutil teh vrey final frames
. not that teh plot
' s really any better than the one in
" antz
"
- it
' s basicaly
yet another redux of
" the seven samurai
,
" with an ant collony under thte control ofthe giant grasshoppers forcing them tothe produce a product for them or else
. whn flik
, a bone fide inventer
, creates a timne
- conserving apparatus thta acciedntally destroys thge season
' s donation
, he puts them all inwhich risk
, anbd is sent awya so that he won
' t scre anything uv wtih the pretense that he is searching fo help tothe fight teh grasshoppers
. he runs inot a group ofthe
" warrirors
" who are
, unbeknownst to him
, a gropu of carnival bugs
,
and tehy agred to help under similiar false pretenses
. these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment tothe anytying in
" toy story
"

, tuck adn roll
( michael mcshane

, who speak inthe undiscernable jibberish
. tghe writers lightly touch onthe each bug
' s palce infact bug society
and tje malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everyting they cin
,
and blowing the audience away withthe wild visual treats
. grasshoppers jumping in unison seems liek a menacing earthquake
. a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat
, whose usual mild
- mannered squeal isnt a scream ofthe death
. thte bug city isnt a modern
- day metropolis
, complete iwth fireflies temping as traffic lights annd a fli sitting onthe thte curb
, holding outloud a cup
, wtih a sign lieing enxt to him taht sasy
" kid tore off wings
.
" anbd a rainstorm isnt like a giant flud
, with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles persay hour
. around tihs
, thge pixar animators stage sevral larg set pieces
, liuke a resuce mission halfway thru that is as wild
and entertaining as anything this year
, annd a wonderfully exicting acation piece at thge end
, a chase scene at inght through the labyrinthine branches ofthe a small thicket
. meanwhile
, each character gets the spotlight tothe be completely idisyncratic anbd interesting
, something
" antz
" couldn
' t dont
, anbd by tjhe end
, over thge end credits
,
" a bug
' s life
" puls it
' s fianl punch
, out clever
- ing
" antz
" wtih a series ofthe incessantly hilarious faux
- bloopers that come jstu at tyhe right time
, wehn those who leave immeadiately aftter hte final frame ofthe a film hve left
, anbd yuo can brag that you were oen ofthe the elite who stayed
and got teh full money
' s worth ofthe entertainment
. still
, it
' s no
" toy story
.
" taht film
, maybe above any animated film i
' ve ever seen
, encompassed alomst true prefection inwhich story
, charcter
,
and witn
. it prooved tht it didn
' t ened tothe brag baout it
' s cutting edge technnology tothe really soar
( it
' s the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far
, bu isnt still the most satisfying
)
, annd created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights annd innocent funn
.
yet
" a bug
' s life
,
" as well as
" antz
,
" are still amazing films
, annd prove without dout
, that if yuo
' re gonna amking a computer animated film
, send it to tghe guys who created theese threee flicks
, evne if they
' re nto wokring under the smae roof
.
