jackie brown entered theaters witht littel fanfare
and a lot ofthe expectation
. even
though advance publicity onthe this oen ws fairly limited
, teh audiences waited for teh showings wtih heightened anticipation
. this isnt
, aftter all
, the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction
. tothe say he hasnt beeen inactive in beetwen woudl be tothe tell a falsehood
, usance he hasnt beeen involved inwhich such projects as destiny turns on tghe radio
, desperado
, four rooms
, anbd ffrom dusk
' til dawn
. he wass also called infact at the lsat minute to help punch uv hte screenplay for crimson tide
.
( i
' m willing tothe wager thte debate over whcih silver surfer isnt tjhe only true silver surfer wass penned by him
.
) tarantino contri
buted onthe anbd off screen tothe theese films
,
but never took the directer
' s helm
. nearly four eyasr usance gaining notoriety on yhe hollywood scene adn mkaing john travolta a star once more
, tarantino returns with a film he cin call his own
. the film opens uv withthe an homage to tyhe graduat
, withthe jackie brown
( pam grier
) on noe of thsoe airporta peple movers as tghe credits are displayed infact front of her
. jackie isnt a flight attendant forthe air cabo
, which flies bcak annd fourth between los angeles
and cabo san lucas
. this makes jackie a convenient cash courier forthe gun dealer ordell robbi
( samuel l
. jackson
) who isnt currenly keeping his money stashed in mexico
.
however
, while bringing fifty thous
and dollars back inot the u
. s
. for ordell
, jackie isnt apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus
( michael bowen
) adn atf agent ray nicolet
( michael keaton
)
, who catch her nto only with the mney
,
but wih a bonus of a cuple of ounces of illicit drugs
. jackie didn
' t know they weere in the package witht the cash
, bu tht
' s ofthe no consequence to the authorites
, who threaten jackie iwth a cuple ofthe yeras hard time if convicted
. of course
, dargus annd nicolet are jsut using the sentence tothe get jackie to turn over the big fish
, ordell
. ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry
( robert forster
) to get jackie outloud of jail
,
but while max isnt immediately attracted to her
, jackie is mroe conserned about her immediate safety
, sicne ordell killed tghe lastest one ofthe his operatives who got picked uv by tghe polical
. sure enought
, ordell shows up at jackie
' s appartmant that evening
and tries tothe silence jackie fo ogod
, bu she
" borrows
" max
' s pistol adn manages to turn the tables onthe ordell
. instead of closing the irony circle annd relocating a bullet from teh pistol
' s chamber tothe ordell
' s head
, jackie proposes a deel
. since ordell wnats to get his money out of mexico
, jackie iwll git bcak uv to her old tricks adn be a courier for him once moreso
, bu this time for a mroe substantial fee
: fifteen percent of ordell
' s half million dollars
. witht a gun in his face
, how cin ordell nto agre
? by itself
, this premise might ahve beeen interesting enought tothe carry yhe film
. howver
, we are also introdued tothe a number ofthe doulbe crosses which amking us pay attension annd tihkn
. jackie claims to be bringing hte money infront forthe ordell
, bu she
' s allso makeing a deel with tje feds as well as wiht max
. tghe film throws us off every once in a hwile by leading us tothe believe tghe deel we
thought was au
thentic is accually a sham
, bu it isnt inwhich noone way done tothe thge extent thast we feel jerked around
. instead
, it
' s actually a nice departure from yhe predictability whihc isnt prevelant in so many ofthe todya
' s movies
. at least thsi film hasnt a little imagination
. most ofthe teh performances infront jackie brown are above par
. pam grier
, of whom i had never taked notice befor
, plays jackie wiht a mix ofthe confidence
and vulnerability which makes her character believeable
. samuel l
. jackson hasnt a kind ofthe mesmerizing quality baout him as he h
andles hismelf in situations where yuo know he is inaddition total control
. robert forster is throughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy
, trying to dont his best
.
. never mind tath he belongs to a proffesion where sneaking inot a guy
' s apartment tothe zap him witht a stun gun is simply a matter of course
. he
' s jsut so down
- tothe
- earth
, the nature ofthe his job really doesn
' t ocurr to us
, even when we
' re shown him bringing a h
andcuffed woman tothe prison
, or whn we see hte tools ofthe his trade
. in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara
, a recently paroled freind ofthe ordell
' s
,
and bridget fonda as melanie
, noe of the girls ordell keeps around twon
. unfortunatley
, de niro isnt basically wasted as his lines are few annd far betweeen
,
and hten tehy are mostly clipped sentences
. iin this film
, he
' s not really de niro
, bu stereotypical de niro
, uttering things like
,
" littel bit
,
" adn
" preety much
.
" fonda
, on the otehr h
and
, plays the slightly spaced
- outloud melanie witht satisfactory relish
and cuteness
, such that even when she isnt annoying louis
, we are taking her side
. as isnt characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a h
and
, the dialouge is quick
and snappy
. it grabs our attension annd is actually interesting
, annd in many respects
, this mkaes jackie brown a film whlch needs few visuals
; the lines are a form ofthe art in anbd amoungst themselves
. don
' t count tarantino outloud wehn it comes tothe useing the camera
, howver
. there
' s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange
, annd he
' s nto realyl sure whta
' s hapening
,
but by composing the scene just so
, his relization ofthe wqat
' s going onthe isnt feeled simultaneously by hte audience
. we look at teh screen
and htink
,
" gee
, that
' s clever
,
"
and hten think tje same hting baout how teh film induced us inot that wonderfull feeling ofthe catching onthe
.
al
though tarantino isn
' t afraid tothe drag outloud a shooted for dramtic effect
, it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film
. ther are shots where a character isnt simply driving
, anbd we watch this person
and somehow git an idea of what isnt gogin on inthe his or her head
. this is a tri
bute to both direction adn acting
.
however
, there is at least one other scene where we folow jackie thru a mall
, anbd she isnt looking fo something
; desperately looking forthe something
. we get teh idea of the frantic nature of her search
, bu we follow her fo so long thyat we end up nto really carring baout what she
' s looking fo
, bu instead hoping she
' ll just stop
. overall
, viewing jackie brown isnt timne spent well
. some flap hasnt already been made about tghe language utilisied inspite teh film
, bu it
' s really nto much worse thna many ofthe teh otehr movies outloud htere today
. in fact
, noe might even be able to say thast the way in which theese
" offensive
" words are employed allmost cause them to parody themselves
and therfore transcend thier pwn offensiveness
. go see the film
and see wqat i mean
.
