based on hte boris karloff ' s classic by hte smae name
, the mummy starts off with the high
- priest ofthe osiris
, imhotep
, who murders the pharoah for his mistress
and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifing way possible
-
- bandaged uv
, having his tounge removed
,
and being covered in flesh
- eating scarab beetles
,
then entombed
.
.
. all hwile still alive
. recap a faw thousand years later
, where a soldier named rick
( played by brandan fraser
) aids a young historian named evelyn
( palyed by rachel wiesz
)
adn her brother
, jonathan
( plyed by john hannah
) infront finding tyhe book ofthe amon ra
, in yhe process inadvertantly freeing thge mummy
. problem is thast the mummy whants tothe revive his mistress
, using evelyn as a sacrafice
.
.
. walking inaddition with relativly low expectations
, i thought this movie wass actually pretty ogod
. teh visuals
and cgi are astounding
,
adn obviously not cheaply done at all
. tehy pack a ton ofthe detail into tjhe images
, expecially during scenes involving mummies renedered completely by cgi
. the coputer spacial effects makes for some brillant scenes
, such as unnerving moments involving flesh
- eating scarab beetles
and moments where tjhe mummy goes affter the peopel who freed him
( after all
, thsoe who tookover his artifacts are cursed
)
. unfortunatley
, the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of timne
, becomeing a tug of war fo controll vetween genres
. on oney hand
, it is a fast paced action film
. onthe the otehr
, it ' s a frightening horror film
.
and on thte side
, it ' s a hilarious comedy
. idealy
, fo it to be successfull
, tghe film woudl haev to focus on noe teh omre acation oriented aspect
, with noe character serving as the comic relief
( that would be johnson
)
. the problem wtih this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic releaf
, wtih rick occasionally delivering his witty one
- liner
. if tehy weere trying to make a horror
- action
- comedy
, it owudl hvea helped if it were established early onthe in the film
,
but unfortunately
, with hte backstory ofthe imhotep ' s entombment
, that woudl be impossible
.
adn
then there ' s tyhe slapstick fight scene vetween a sword
- wielding rick
annd an army of mummies
. while really well done
, it hadnt tyhe efel ofthe slapstick comedy
. replace the sword withthe a chainsaw
and ytou ' d effectively have ash fighting zombies inthe army ofthe darkness
. hwile intertaining
adn funny
, it feels really out of palce
.
bu at least it ' s a break from the naieve hereos thgat brendan fraser has been playing a lot of
. on tyhe whole
, the movei is pure popcorn fare from beginning tothe end
, entertaining the audience
.
bu i must end my review iwth a plea to movei theatre owners
.
.
. turn the sound down
! while a lot ofthe theatres have ogod soudn systems
, my ears weere almost rininging as i walked out ofthe the theatre
( the sound is particularly irritating
and wiull amke ytou crap your pants if ytou ' re not careful
)
. when tehy were showing yhe trailer for the upcomming schwarzenegger film
,
" end ofthe dyas
"
, it wass so loud i couldn ' t mkea anytying out
.
