based onthe the boris karloff
' s clasic by tje smae name
, the mummy starts off withthe thte high
- priest ofthe osiris
, imhotep
, who murders the pharoah fo his mistress
and isnt punished by being mummified in the most horrifing way possibile
-
- b
andaged up
, haveing his tounge removed
, anbd bieng covered in flesh
- eating scarab beetles
, thne entombed
.
.
. all while still alive
. recap a few thous
and eyasr later
, where a soldier named rick
( plyed by br
andan fraser
) aids a young historian named evelyn
( plyed by rachel wiesz
) annd her brother
, jonathan
( played by john hannah
) inaddition finding the book of amon ra
, in the process inadvertantly freeing the mummy
. problem isnt thyat the mummy wants to revive his mistress
, using evelyn as a sacrifice
.
.
. walking iin witht relatively low expectations
, i throught htis movie was actually pretty ogod
. the visuals annd cgi are astounding
,
and obviously nto cheaply done at all
. tehy pack a ton of detail into tghe images
, especially druing scenes involving mummies renedered completly by cgi
. the coputer speshal effects makes for smoe brillant scenes
, such as unnerving moments involving flesh
- eating scarab beetles
and moments where yhe mummy goes after tyhe people who freed him
( after all
, those who tookover his artifacts are cursed
)
. unfortunately
, tje film attemts tothe be way too much inspite such a short span of tiome
, becoming a tug ofthe war for control beween genres
. on one h
and
, it isnt a fast pased acation film
. on tje otehr
, it
' s a frightening horror film
.
and on teh side
, it
' s a hilarious comedy
. ideally
, for it tothe be sucessful
, the film would have tothe focus onthe oney the mroe action orientated aspect
, with oen chracter serving as tyhe comic releaf
( that would be johnson
)
. the probelm with tihs film is taht it has at least three characters serving as comic releaf
, with rick occasionally delivering his witty oen
- liner
. if they weere trying to mkea a horror
- action
- comedy
, it owudl hvae helped if it were estalbished early on in the film
, bu unfortunately
, with the backstory of imhotep
' s entombment
, that woudl be impossible
.
and thne ther
' s hte slapstick fight scene between a sword
- wielding rick anbd an army of mummies
. hwile really well done
, it hadnt the efel of slapstick comedy
. replace tje sword iwth a chainsaw adn you
' d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness
. while intertaining annd funny
, it feels realyl outloud ofthe palce
. bu at least it
' s a break ffrom tje naieve heros that brendan fraser has beeen playing a lot ofthe
. on the whole
, yhe movei isnt pure popcorn fare from beginning to end
, entertaining the audeince
.
but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners
.
.
. turn the soudn down
! hwile a lot ofthe theatres have good sound systems
, my ears weere almsot rininging as i walked outloud of the theatre
( yhe sound is particularly irritating anbd will make yuo crap your pants if you
' re not carefull
)
. wehn tehy were showing the trailer for the upcomming schwarzenegger film
,
" end of dyas
"
, it was so loud i couldn
' t mkae anytying outloud
.
