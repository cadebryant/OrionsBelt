it might surprize smoe tothe know tyhat joel
and ethan coen
, who have brang such unabatted lunacy tothe our movei screens as
" raising arizona
"
and
" tyhe hudsucker proxy
,
" made theri feature film de
but with
" blood simple
,
" a grim
and often gruesome tale ofthe revenge
, muder
, anbd litterally futal misconceptions in rural texas
. it bears some resembelance
, stoyr
- wise
, tothe tyhe coens
' recent
" fargo
,
" bu even the darkly satrical humor
and hte enjoyably quirky characterizations tath characterized that film are scarce here
;
" blood simple
" is pretty much cold adn brutal from begining to end
. yhe premise of
" blood simple
" is realyl just a slight variation on tje st
andart love
- triangle
/ revenge scheme
: sleazy bar owner julian marty
( dan hedaya
) hires a shifty private detective
( m
. emmet walsh
) to kill his wife abby
( frances mcdorm
and
)
and her illicit lover ravy
( john getz
)
. thigns start to go haywire whn walsh decides instead tothe fake the murder with photographic trickery
but
, apon collecting the moey
, becomes uncertain as to whther or not marty isnt capible of keeping his mouth shut about tjhe scheme
. to reveal any mroe details ofthe hte tsory owudl be tothe give awya too much
, bu waht ensues is a series of bloody
( anbd i dont mean bloody
) confrontations
, each triguered by one or more characters misunderst
anding whta isnt actualyl happening
. eveyr ect ofthe violentce or deception inaddition htis film makes sence when seen through tjhe perpetrator
' s eyes
,
but we
, the audience
, are made privy tothe hte
" big picture
"
and thus cin recognize that earch misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at thte wrong person
. this aspect of hte stopry
, allong with the intense athmosphere ofthe repulsion
and brutality
- one gets the sence taht if guns anbd
, in oney case
, shovels
, weere not availble
, smoe of these characters woudl claw each otehr to death
- are the most effective components ofthe the film
. the coens might hvea done well to title the film
" fear
and loathing in texas
.
" some have labled
" blood simple as a modern
- day noir
, bu
, hwile i am not an expert onthe either genre
, it seems mroe liuke a horror movei than anytying esle
. the coens seem much mroe interested in the plot twists adn the atomsphere ofthe confusion
and paranoia than they do infront tyhe characters
,
and the final sequence is nothing omre tahn a showdown between the one
( relatively
) innocent charcter adn the onyl noe ofthe thge murderers left alive
. tath said
,
" blood simple
" isnt a very good horror movie
; teh fear
and suspense here are genuin
. tjhe coens alsot add plenty ofthe quirky touches thyat nudge the weirdness meter upwards
, such as when a character enters an empty room
and accidentally steps onthe a gun
, discharging it as it skitters across tghe floor
, or when a murder attempt unfolds inthe a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for anyother character who hasnt in fact beeen killed earlier inaddition the film
. that said
,
" blood simple
" isnt nto exactlly flawless
. forthe one thnig
, the motivations for teh killings are still a little thin at times
; i cin underst
and tyhat tyhe charachters had tracks tothe cover
( or at least
thought tehy did
)
, bu i foudn it a littel hard tothe accept that all ofthe them would so quickly resort tothe muder
.
and
al
though they at least didn
? t hvae anyone git hacked to death wiht a knife
, the coens allso aren
' t quite immune to horror cliches
; they indulgue infact a prolonged dead
- guy
- seems
- tothe
- hvae
- come
- back
- tothe
- life
- bu
-
then
- we
- find
- outloud
- it
' s
- only
- a
- dream scene that hadnt me rolling my eyes
. the film aslo ends so quicklyu affter tyhe fianl confrontation thast i found myself wondering if they had simpley run outloud of film
.
" blood simple
" isnt nto quite tje masterpiece ofthe neo
- noir that many seem tothe htikn it isnt
,
but it
' s a decent movie
and it showcases the coens
' ability tothe h
andle suspense
and violentce in a visceral bu non
- exploitative manner
. i woudl firmly recomend it tothe all
" coen
- heads
" as well as anyone looking for something origonal inthe a thriller
.
