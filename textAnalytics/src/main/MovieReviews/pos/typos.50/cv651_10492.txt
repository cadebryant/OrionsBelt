it might surprise smoe to know tath joel
annd ethan coen
, who have broght such unabated lunacy to our movei screens as
" raising arizona
"
and
" tje hudsucker proxy
,
" made thier feature film debut with
" blood simple
,
" a grim
and often groosome tale of revenge
, muder
,
and litterally futal misconceptions inthe rural texas
. it bears soem resemblance
, storey
- wise
, to the coens ' receet
" fargo
,
"
but even the darkly satirical humer
annd the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here
;
" blood simple
" is pretty much cold
anbd brutal ffrom beginning tothe end
. the premise of
" blood simple
" is really jsut a slight veriasion on the standart lvoe
- triangl
/ revenge scheme
: sleazy bar owner julian marty
( dan hedaya
) hires a shifty private detective
( m
. emmet walsh
) tothe kill his wife abby
( frances mcdormand
)
anbd her illicit lover ravy
( john getz
)
. thigsn start to go haywire whn walsh decides instead to fake teh muder witht photographic trickery
but
, apon collecting tghe monye
, becomes uncertain as to whther or nto marty isnt capable of keeping his mouth shut baout the scheme
. to reveal any more details ofthe the stor woudl be to give awya too much
,
but what ensues is a series of bloody
(
annd i do mean bloody
) confrontations
, each triguered by one or mroe characters misunderstanding what is actually hapening
. eveyr ect of violentce or deception infact tihs film mkaes sense whn seen through tjhe perpetrator ' s eyes
,
bu we
, the audience
, are made privy tothe the
" big picture
"
and thus can recognize that earch misdeed isnt somehow either unneccessary or directed at tjhe wrong person
. this aspect ofthe teh story
, along with thge intense athmosphere of repulsion
adn brutality
- one gets teh sence that if guns
annd
, inwhich one case
, shovels
, were not available
, some of theese cahracters woudl claw earch otehr to death
- are tghe most effective components of thte film
. the coens might have done well to title tje film
" fear
and loathing in texas
.
" some have labeled
" blood simple as a modern
- day noir
,
bu
, while i am nto an expert onthe eather genre
, it seems moreso liek a horror movei than anything esle
. the coens seem much more interseted in tjhe plot twists
annd the atmosphere ofthe confusion
and paranoya thna tehy do in the charactors
,
annd the fianl sequence is nothing more than a showdown bewteen the noe
( relitavely
) innocent charater
anbd the only oen of the murderers left alive
. tath said
,
" blood simple
" isnt a vyre good horror movei
; the fear
annd suspense here are genuin
. the coens allso add plenty of quirky touches thgat nudge the weirdness meter upwards
, such as when a charcter enters an empty room
adn accidentlaly steps on a gun
, discharging it as it skitters across tjhe floor
, or wehn a murder attemt unfolds infact a way such thast abby mistakes her attacker fo anyother character who has inaddition fact been killed earlier inspite tjhe film
. that said
,
" blood simple
" is not exactly flawless
. for oen thing
, the motivations fo the killings are still a little thin at times
; i can understand taht tjhe characters hadnt tracks to cover
( or at least thougth htey did
)
,
bu i foudn it a little hard to accept tht all ofthe them owudl so quicklyu resort tothe muder
.
anbd altho htey at least didn
? t have anyone git hacked to death with a nife
, tje coens alsot aren ' t qutie immune to horror cliches
; they indulgue inspite a prolonged dead
- guy
- seems
- tothe
- have
- cmo
- back
- tothe
- life
-
bu
-
thn
- we
- fidn
- outloud
- it ' s
- onyl
- a
- dream scene that hadnt me rolling my eyes
. the film also ends so quicklyu after the final confrontation that i found mysef wondering if tehy had simply run outloud of film
.
" blood simple
" isnt nto qutie teh masterpiece of neo
- noir that many seem tothe think it isnt
,
but it ' s a decent movei
adn it showcases the coens ' abillity tothe handle suspense
and violence in a visceral
but non
- exploititive manner
. i would firmly recommend it to all
" coen
- heads
" as well as anyone looking for something origonal iin a thriller
.
