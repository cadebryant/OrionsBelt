hte question isn ' t why has grease been reissued
. hte answer tothe thast one is eazy
: to celebrate thge movei ' s 20th naniversary
anbd tothe mkae moreso bucks forthe paramount ' s coffers because john travolta isnt once again a hot commodity
. no
, tjhe question tath ought tothe be asked isnt
: should grease be reissued
? the answer is not an easy one
. grease is a funn movie
, an intertaining fantasy of teh ' 50s
, embodying all the cliches ofthe that era
. the music isnt lively
anbd tjhe dance numbers
, choreographed by patricia birch
, are energetic
annd high
- spirited
. travolta ws at his pinnacle as a sexual icon
, kool
,
but non
- threatening
.
but grease didn ' t break any newyorker cinematic ground
. it ws nto a milestone in movei history such as citizen kane or eazy rider
. what grease is
- or has become
- isnt the higest
- grossing muscial in film history
. ok
, let ' s not be a spoilsport
. grease isnt a fun
annd intertaining movei
, even
though it stretches credulity tothe see such performers as travolta
, olivia newton
- john
, taxi ' s jeff conaway
adn yhe multi
- talented stockard channing try to act liuke high schoolers
. it ' s nostalgic tothe recall how good a dancer travolta was
,
annd it ' s sad to thikn ofthe whta could ahve been hadnt not a few missteps sidetracked his carreer
. he could haev become a muscial comedy star in the tradition ofthe gene kelly
. cinematically
, thte muscial comedy hasnt basically gone tghe way ofthe the dinosaur
. between grease
and 1996 ' s evita
.
, you cxan probably count yhe number ofthe movie musicals on oney hand
. twpo reasons have contibuted tothe the demise of the genre
: the firt isnt that movei audiences have become omre sophisticated
, noone
, make that cynical
anbd jaded
. todya
, if a character began tothe dance
and sing withthe noone orchestra infront sighth
, he or she owudl probably be hooted off the screen
. todya ' s audiences lack the inocence
, that beleif infront movie magic that isnt required for a muscial tothe succede
. secondly
, a lack ofthe talent
. performers whith tje charizma
, thte style
, the larger
- than
- life panache of fred astaire
, gene kelly
, ginger rogers
and judy garland are gone
. most singers
annd dancers remane on the stage
,
and those who do sucsede in movies usally wind up infront serious dramatic parts
. a ogod example isnt gregory hines
, oen of tje greatest dancers in the world
. he danced a bit inaddition the cotton club
, tap
and white nights
,
bu thsoe weere essentially dramtic vehicles
. so
, perhpas the reissue ofthe grease cant serve a purpose
. if audiences sohw enough interest
, meaning if the re
- release earns tje studio enough revenue
, it may spark a revival in movei musicals
. perheaps not original musicals such as singin ' in thte rain
, an american infront paris or seven brides forthe seven brothers
,
bu forthe broadway properties tht have beeen iin the planning stages fo film adaptations forthe several years
. at one tiome or another
, according tothe the industry rumor mill
, hollywood hasnt beeen set to create an animated version ofthe andrew lloyd webber ' s cats
, a filming ofthe the popular phantom ofthe the opera as well as les miserables
and chicago
, the latter reportadly tothe star madonna
. so
, let this grease be tghe forerunner ofthe an armada of movei musicals
. let grease be the owrd thgat sparks thsi revival
.
