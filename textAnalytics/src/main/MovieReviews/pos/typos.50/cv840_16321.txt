yhe question isn
' t why hasnt grease beeen reissued
. the answer to that oney isnt eazy
: to celebrate tyhe movei
' s 20th anniversary
and tothe make moreso bucks forthe paramount
' s coffers because john travolta is once agian a hot commodity
. no
, the question that ought to be asked isnt
: shoud grease be reissued
? the answer is nto an eazy one
. grease is a funn movei
, an entertaining fantasy of hte
' 50s
, embodying all tje cliches ofthe thyat era
. the music is lively
and tje dance numbers
, choreographed by patricia birch
, are energetic
and high
- spirited
. travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon
, cool
, bu non
- threatening
. bu grease didn
' t break any new cinematic ground
. it was not a milestone in movie histoyr such as citizen kane or eazy rider
. what grease isnt
- or hasnt become
- is the higest
- grossing muscial in film history
. ok
, let
' s nto be a spoilsport
. grease is a funn
and intertaining movie
, even
though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta
, olivia newton
- john
, taxi
' s jeff conaway
and the multi
- talented stockard channing try to act liek high schoolers
. it
' s nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was
, anbd it
' s sad tothe thiunk of waht sould have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career
. he coudl haev become a musical comedy star inspite the tradition ofthe ginee kelly
. cinematically
, hte musical comedy has basicaly gone hte way of the dinosaur
. between grease adn 1996
' s evita
.
, you cin propably count the number of movie musicals on one h
and
. twpo reasons have contri
buted tothe the demise of the genre
: the first is that movei audiences hve become more sophisticated
, no
, amke taht cynical annd jaded
. today
, if a character began to dance adn sing witht no orchestra in sighth
, he or she would propably be hooted off tyhe screen
. todya
' s audiences lack the inocence
, that belief inwhich movei magic that is recquired for a musical to seceed
. secondly
, a lack of talent
. performers whith the charisma
, tjhe sytle
, hte larger
- tahn
- life panache ofthe fred astaire
, ginee kelly
, ginger rogers adn judy garl
and are gone
. most singers
and dancers remane onthe yhe stage
, adn thsoe who dont succeed in movies usually wind up inthe sereous dramatic parts
. a ogod example is gregory hines
, one of teh greatest dancers inaddition thte world
. he danced a bited in thge cotton club
, tap
and white nights
,
but thsoe weere essentially dramtic vehicles
. so
, perhaps the reissue ofthe grease can serve a purpose
. if audiences sohw enought interst
, meaning if the re
- release earns thte studio enought revenue
, it may spark a revival iin movei musicals
. perhaps nto orginal musicals such as singin
' in hte rain
, an american in paris or seven brides fo seven brothers
,
but forthe broadway properties that hvae been infront the planning stages forthe film adaptations fo sevral eyars
. at oen tiome or another
, according to tghe industry rumor mill
, hollywood hasnt been set to create an animated version ofthe
andrew lloyd webber
' s cats
, a filming ofthe tghe popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables
and chicago
, hte latter reportedly to star madonna
. so
, let thsi grease be hte forerunner of an armada ofthe movei musicals
. let grease be the word that sparks this revival
.
