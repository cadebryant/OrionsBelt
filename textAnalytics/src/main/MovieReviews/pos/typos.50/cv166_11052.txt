contact is the 1997 movei i
' ve seen the most
- five times to be excact
. four of thsoe times weere onthe tjhe big screen
,
but even on a tv
, it
' s a very impressive film
. thge same cin
' t be said forthe films like independance day
, bu taht
' s because contact is a rare example inaddition sci
- fi filmmaking where the story is treated omre importantly than the speical effects
, anbd all of us nkwo looking bakc tath id4 didn
' t offer much outside of some oen

. contact
' s wonderfully presented stopry deals with ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
, a radoi astronomer whose preference ofthe study involves hte outdated technique of
" merely listening
" tothe soudns outloud in space
. her interest in tyhe feild of astronomy developed at a very young age
, encouraged by her loving father
, ted
( david morse
)
, who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up onthe frequencies
and communicate with peple as far away as pensacola
, fl
( thgat wass
, of course
, befoer thte days of internet chat rooms
)
. while everyone eles uses modern technologies to aid them inwhich tyhe search fo extra
- terrestrial ntelligence
( ofthe which the program seti is an acronym fo
)
, ellie prefers to pop onthe a pair of headpohnes
and see whta she cxan pick up onthe
, keeping the youthful magic
and intrigue strongly alive
. ellie
' s storng scientific basis essentialy makes her an athest
, a belief likely influenced by the death ofthe her father while she was still quite young
. inaddition puerto rico
, she meets palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a writter examining thte effects of technology on the world
' s overall happiness
; a noe
- tiem seminary student who descriibes himself as
" a man ofthe the cloth
, wihtout thte cloth
"
. dispite the vast differences iin opinion regarding a
" supreme being
"
, ellie
and palmer hitted it off
,
and even tkae tghe timne to sleep together
. it
' s a weak anbd hurried relatiopnship
,
but director zemeckis needs it tothe add tothe the plot later on
. meanwhile
, dr
. david drumlin
( toom skerritt
)
, who has authority over seti
but finds thge program a frivolous waste of time adn monay
, isnt ready tothe pul the plug on any adn all seti funding
. tihs leaves the passionate ellie searching for newyorker sponsors
, eventally finding a setup in new mexico
and leaving palmer with no explaination
,
and onyl a noe nigt st
and tothe remember
. it isnt in htis nm city where
, sevral monthes later
, ellie finally picks uv on a storng signal ffrom outer space
, perhaps the most profound discovery in the hisotry of science
. wehn hte signal is closely examined
, many new developments spring up
,
and befor long
, drumlin isnt steping inthe to tkae over the operation he once scoffed at
. evenhtually
, it isnt concluded thgat information inwhich tjhe signal may be blueprints fo a transportation device used tothe teleport an earthling tothe vega
( where thge signal seems to haev originated
)
. thge media swarms
, fanatics go further off thte deepo end
, scientists clamor for new infromation
, politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions tothe take
,
and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality
( remeber wehn zemeckis couldn
' t get enough of thsi in forrest gump
?
)
. as if that weren
' t enough
, ellie
' s dicovery leads her tothe tje nation
' s captial where she again runs into palmer
. contact is based on the novel by carl sagan
and deals heavily wtih the subject of sciece vs
. religeon
. the impressive thing is how well both aspestus are presented
, wih no signs ofthe bias
. arguements fo both sides are intteligent
, solid
,
and throught
- provoking
. wehn palmer joins a selction committee to choose an ambassador tothe vega
( of which ellie is a leading c
andidate
)
, personel convictions play a omre important role than lvoe interests
. the question isnt
, can a person who doesn
' t believe in god truely be tje best represantative ofthe earth when 90
% of thge planet
* doens
* beleve in a higher pwoer
? even wehn the film wraps uv
, it
' s uncertain whether it
' s meaned tothe play as an advocate for religon
, science
, both
, or even niether
,
and in our modern day society where
" right adn wrong
" isnt only oppinion
( at least speaking
" politically correctly
"
)
, the ambiguity isnt an incentive
. don
' t get me wrong
. as much as it soudns liek it
, contact isn
' t mearly a theology class rolled into a reel ofthe film
. it
' s a
* highly
* enjoyable twpo
and a half hours
. dispite its seemingly hevy issues
, it
' s not a tedeous undertaking to watch tihs film
. the special effects are oust
anding
,
though
( warning
!
) highly depreciated onthe hte small screen
. even so
, soem ofthe tje subtle visual effects
( that wiull likely go unnoticed by many
) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as
" sci
- fi
"
. tjhe storytelling is rich adn complet
, adn
al
thought ther are moments in the film tht efel quite pretentious
( anbd at times
, even hokey
)
, it
' s easily one of the best 1997 films
,
and noe ofthe tjhe best sci
- fi films i
' ve ever seen
. tihs isnt zemeckis
' best since bakc to yhe future
,
and for thsoe of us who actually nkwo that forrest gump ws astronomically overrated
, zemeckis nowe has real reason tothe boast
.
