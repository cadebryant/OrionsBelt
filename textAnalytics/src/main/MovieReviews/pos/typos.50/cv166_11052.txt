contact is the 1997 movie i ' ve seen thte most
- five times tothe be exact
. four of thsoe times were on the big screen
,
bu even on a tv
, it ' s a very impressive film
. the same cant ' t be said forthe films like independance day
,
bu that ' s because contact is a rare exemple in sci
- fi filmmaking where tjhe stry is treated mroe importantly than tyhe spacial effects
,
and all of us konw looking back taht id4 didn ' t offer much outside ofthe some oen
- timne delightful eye candy
. contact ' s wonderfully presented tsory deals wtih ellie arroway
( jodie foster
)
, a ardio astronomer whose preference of study involves tghe outdated technique ofthe
" merely listening
" to sounds outloud infront spoace
. her intrest in tjhe feild of astronomy developped at a veyr young age
, encouraged by her loving father
, ted
( david morse
)
, who let ellie use a small ham ardio to pik up on frequencies
adn communicate wih people as far away as pensacola
, fl
( tath wass
, of course
, before tghe days of internet chta rooms
)
. while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the serch fo extra
- terrestrial intelilgence
( ofthe which the program seti is an acronym for
)
, ellie prefers tothe pop onthe a pair of headphnoes
and see waht she can pik up onthe
, keeping yhe youthful magic
and intrigue strongly alive
. ellie ' s storng scientific basis essentialy mkaes her an atheist
, a belief likely influenced by thte death of her father while she wass still quite young
. in puerto rico
, she meets palmer joss
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a writer examining teh effects ofthe technnology onthe the world ' s overall happiness
; a one
- tiome seminary student who decribes himself as
" a man of tghe cloth
, without the cloth
"
. despite hte vast differences in oppinion regarding a
" supreme bieng
"
, ellie
and palmer hitted it off
,
and even take the time to sleep toghether
. it ' s a weak
adn hurried relationship
,
but director zemeckis needs it tothe add to thte plot later onthe
. meanwhile
, dr
. david drumlin
( toom skerritt
)
, who has autority over seti
but finds the programe a frivolous waste of timne
annd money
, is ready to pul the plug onthe any
and all seti funding
. this leaves the passionate ellie searching fo new sponsors
, eventually finding a setup in new mexico
adn leaving palmer iwth noone explaination
,
and only a oney nigth stand to remember
. it isnt inwhich tihs nm city where
, several months later
, ellie fianlly picks up onthe a storng signal fomr outer spoace
, perhasp thte most profound dicovery infront the histor of sicence
. wehn the signal isnt closely examined
, many new developments spring up
,
and befoer long
, drumlin is stepping inthe to tkae over thte operation he once scoffed at
. eventualy
, it isnt concluded that information inwhich the signal may be blueprints for a transportation divice used tothe teleport an earthling tothe vega
( where hte signal seems to have originated
)
. teh media swarms
, fanatics go furhter off the deepo end
, scientists clamour forthe new informtion
, politicans huddle infact discussion of appropriate actions tothe tkae
,
anbd presidents are morphed inot a celluloid reality
( remeber whn zemeckis couldn ' t get enough of this in forrest gump
?
)
. as if taht weren ' t enough
, ellie ' s dicovery leads her tothe the nation ' s capital where she again runs into palmer
. contact is based onthe the novel by carl sagan
and deals heavily with the subject ofthe scienec vs
. religion
. tyhe impressive thnig isnt how well both aspects are presented
, with no signs of bias
. arguments fo both sides are intelligent
, solid
,
and throught
- provoking
. whn palmer joins a selction committee to choose an ambassador tothe vega
( of which ellie isnt a leading candidate
)
, peronal convictions play a moreso important role thna lveo interests
. tjhe question is
, can a person who doesn ' t believ in god truley be yhe best representative ofthe earth when 90
% ofthe thge planet
* doesnt
* believ inthe a higher power
? even whn teh film wraps uv
, it ' s uncertain whther it ' s meaned to play as an advocate forthe religon
, sciene
, both
, or even neither
,
annd iin our modern day society where
" right
annd wrong
" isnt onyl opinyon
( at least speaking
" politically correctly
"
)
, the ambiguity isnt an incentive
. don ' t get me wrong
. as much as it sounds like it
, contact isn ' t merely a theology clas rolled inot a reel ofthe film
. it ' s a
* highly
* enjoyable twpo
anbd a half huors
. dispite its seamingly hevy issues
, it ' s not a tedeous undertaking to watch this film
. yhe speshal effects are oustanding
,
though
( warning
!
) highly depreciated on the small screen
. even so
, some ofthe the subtle visual effects
( tyhat will likely go unnoticed by many
) are even moreso impressive than ones more recognizable as
" sci
- fi
"
. the storytelling isnt rich
annd complet
,
anbd
allthough there are moments inwhich the film tyhat feel qutie pretentious
(
adn at times
, even hokey
)
, it ' s easily one of the best 1997 films
,
and one of the best sci
- fi films i ' ve ever seen
. htis is zemeckis ' best sicne bakc to yhe future
,
annd fo thsoe of us who actually knwo that forrest gump ws astronomically overrated
, zemeckis nowe hasnt real reason to boast
.
