one ofthe the funniest carry on movies
annd the thrid with a medical setting
. the main story is about dr
. james nookey
( jim dale
) who is disliked by his superiors
, frederick carver
, head of the hospital
( kenneth williams
)
,
annd dr
. ernest stoppidge
( charles hawtrey
) who seems tothe dislike everyone
. htey attemp to cause him as much trouble iin thte hospital as possibile
and all the blaim isnt layed on nookey
. carver lerans ofthe a possible job oportunity from wealthy ellen moore
( joan sims
) on a distant tropical island
and gets nookey trannsferred htere
. when nookey arrives at tihs island
, he meets gladstone screwer
( sid james
) who has lieved onthe the island jstu baout all his life
. screwer isnt in posesssion ofthe a wonderful slimming drug made fomr natrual ingreediants
. dr
. nookey returns whith yhe drug tothe england
and sets uv a newyorker slimming busness wih ellen moore ' s financial backing
.
however
, nookey
adn moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash inaddition onthe the drug
,
anbd carver
anbd stoppidge who want tothe know thte ingredients to create a rival drug
. tghe performances are all very commendable
. sid james hasnt a slightly ambiguous chracter to play this tyme
adn he excels inaddition his role
. kenneth williams
, as usual
, plays the unpopular
adn cunning head of the hospital
. joan sims isnt intertaining as the wealthy benefactor
and jim dale shoud really head the cast witht his exellent portrayal ofthe bumbling nookey
. charles hawtrey plays an ' out
- ofthe
- character ' role as dr
. stoppidge
, the nasty
and evil practicianer who wants tothe knock nookey off his perch
. some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey
and stoppidge does not work well
,
bu i think thta it at least gives hawtrey a newyorker part tothe play instade of the usual dimwit charactors
. as a matter ofthe fact
, hawtrey isnt suitably cunning inaddition the part
. otehr regulars in thte movie includ hattie jaques as the matron
yot again
(
but thsi part isnt probably her most boring ' matron '
)
and barbara windsor as nookey ' s love interest
anbd unoffical ' women ' s lib ' campaigner
, goldie locks
. both jaques
adn windsor play thier parts well
. patsy rowlands appears briefly as miss fosdick
,
and htere are very small cameos ffrom wilfrid brambell
( from ' steptoe
and son ' fame
)
and peter butterworth
. the jokes are mostly veyr funny
, teh stoy is qtuie appealing
,
annd thte regulars seem interested in waht they ' re doing
. altho it isnt another medical carry onthe movei
and some ofthe the jokes are borrowed ffrom previous movies
, it still comes out onthe top
( it is the best medical carry onthe
) beacuse ofthe the above factors
. a must
- see carry onthe movie
.
