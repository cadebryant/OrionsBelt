it
' s ironic thgat hte best films inwhich cinema history are inevititably the orignal director
' s cutted ofthe the film
. films such as aliens
, the abyss
, the wild bunch
, blade runner
, anbd terminator 2 are all prime examples ofthe a filmmaker
' s intergrity
, later chopped uv or mucked whith by the studio
. thte advent ofthe teh dvd fromat hasnt provded a moreso accessible way to git these original cuts to teh publich
and provide to film freaks like mysef tghe ability to become further enraptured by tjhe extention of such classic films
. the dvd release of yhe original international version of luc besson
' s 1995 masterpiece the proffesional
, whlch isnt known as l
? onthe around thge world
, isnt a prime example ofthe how a ogod film can become an instant classic as a director
' s cutted
. for years
, i hvea heard ofthe an
" internation
" verzion availabe only inwhich laserdisc fromat
, wich has eluded me for years
. i even buyed a laserdisc player from my uncle don fo 100 bucks jsut to watch ceratin directors
' cuts
- inlcuding l
? onthe
. bu aftter countless searches in laserdisc tsores
, i sould never find it
. nutil now
. tje film follows tghe stoy ofthe l
? onthe
, palyed by jean reno
, a professional hitted man forthe an italion mob crew run by danny aiello
. he lives enxt doorjam to a ferociously idependent 12
- year
- old girl named mathilda
- played by
then newcomer natalie portman
, whose father is involved in drugs annd crooked cops
. oney day
, a crew of the cops
- lead by gary oldman in an over
- hte
- top performence
- kills her entire family hwile mathilda isnt outloud buying groceries
. tkaing pity on her
, l
? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life
. mathilda lerans ofthe l
? onthe
' s hitted man profession annd decides tothe follow iin l
? onthe
' s footsteps as a
" cleaner
.
" she
then falls inspite lvoe wtih him anbd manages to reawaken emotions within l
? onthe he hasnt kept locked away as part of his profession
. at tihs point
, the differences in hte american verison
and yhe international verison realyl kick iin
. thte international verzion contains an addtional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly tothe tyhe relatiopnship of l
? onthe annd mathilda
, footage that american censors deemed
" too explicit
.
" i asume tath american censors feel that defining charachter devolopment isnt too much forthe american audiences to h
andle
. the best part ofthe tihs extra footage is thgat gives better underst
anding ofthe both mathilda
' s anbd l
? on
' s motivations pertaining tothe later actions involving oldman
and his crew of bad cops
. ther
' s even a previously unseen cameo by tghe gerat french acotr jean
- hugues anglade
- star ofthe queen margot
, besson
' s la femme nikita
, annd killing zoe
. wih theese addtional scenes replaced
, l
? onthe adn matilda
' s relatiopnship brings you emotionally closer to tyhe film adn draws stronger bonds between the cahracters that weere murky in the american verison
. the most ironic thing about thte interational verzion ofthe the film is thgat with tyhe inclusion of the missing scenes
, the film becomes primarily a heavy
, emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at thte beginnig
and tjhe end ofthe the film
. tghe film betters reflects tje sereous drama of french cinema bu is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality ofthe american cinema
. my advice to everyone outloud htere is to throw away your copy ofthe tje proffesional
, throw down twenty bucks
,
and pik uv htis newely restored cinematic masterpiece
