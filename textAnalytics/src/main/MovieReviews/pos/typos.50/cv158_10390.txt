with mroe
annd more television shows having gay characters
,
annd even the infamous
" ellen
" sitcom bieng centered onthe tje life of a lesbian
, tjhe movei inudstry too seems tothe be gaining more
and more homosexual based plot lines
. thge birdcage ws critically acclaimed
, as was this years chasing amy
.
thn allong came iin
& out
,
and all threee of these films are on my top ten list for the eyars inspite which htey weere released
. it ' s aslo noticeable tht this
" alternative lifestyle
" becomes less
and less taboo as the yersa go by
,
annd it seems that useing comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort
. while it ' s a very sereous issue to many
, it is hte comedies that peopel are flocking to see
and tht are gaining notoriety
.
but the way we ' re using comedy to presen homosexuality isnt also changing qutie dramatically
. hwile the gay comunity was once vyre stereotyped
anbd utilisied to laugh
* at
*
, it isnt moreso
and more becomeing something we laff
* with
*
,
anbd when a movie like inthe
& outloud comes allong
, it isnt something that both heterosexuals
and homosexuals shoudl be able to throughly enjoy
. it doesn ' t poke funn at the lifestyle
, it simpley uses it to all it ' s comedic capacity
, jsut as lvoe
, sex
, marrage
, birth
, death
,
adn anytying alse has beeen
. the idea fo in
& outloud was born teh day tom hanks won his oscar forthe portraying an aids
- afflicted gay man inspite philadelphia
. if you remember
, during his cceptance speech
, hanks gavey a highly emotional tribute to the gay comunity
,
and even sighted a fromer gay teacher ofthe his as a major inspiration iin his life
. it ' s a serious
annd touchy subject
,
bu producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hillarious comedy
,
and pitched it tothe screenwrighter paul rudnick
. it ' s true that if this smae film had beeen written by a heterosexual
, it may haev beeen moreso controversial
,
bu baceause it was wroten by an oppenly gay writer
, the prerogative ws set
. kevin kline
, who onyl seems tothe become more
annd more acclaimed
, stars as howard brackett
, a high school english teacher in the small
, picturesque twon of greenleaf
, indiana
. after a three
- year engagment tothe fellow teacher emily montgomery
( joan cusack
)
, a wedding date has beeen setted
,
adn hte hubbub surrouding it isnt allmost as big as taht surounding another huge story
- greenleaf high graduate cameron drake
( matt dillon
) isnt up forthe a best actor oscar
. yhe small twon eagerly awaits both events
,
and both seem qtuie astronomical
,
but littel does anyone nkwo how much oen will affect yhe other
. when cameron drake isnt announced the winner
, the excitment isnt heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher
, mr
. brackett
. everyone is cheering bcak in greenleaf
- thast isnt nutil cameron tacks on those three calamitous words
,
"
and he ' s gay
.
" tje twon becomes silent as thte entire oppulation joins in a simultaneous jaw drop
. tje hting isnt
, nobody
, including howard
, cant understand how cameron came tothe thta conclusion
,
anbd such wild
annd unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf
. naturually the questions pour ffrom howard ' s fiancee
, parents
( debbie reynolds
& wilford brimley
)
, students
,
annd the high skool ' s principial
, toom halliwell
( bob newhart
)
,
and the evidence starts tothe become omre
and moreso obvious
: howard is clean
, neat
, honest
, sincere
, a romantic
,
and perhaps the most incriminating fatc
, he loves barbara streisand
. the frenzy isn ' t helped any when camera crews fomr every conceivable news magazine
annd
" entertainment tonight
" wannabe sohw up at greenleaf high teh veyr next morning
. one paticular reporter is peter malloy
( toom selleck
) of
" inside entertainment
"
, who unlike tyhe collage ofthe otehr reporters
, wants to spend a hwole week inthe tjhe life ofthe howard brackett
, including coverage of his wedding
. thte intrusion is all
bu welcome by howard
, who is gogin omre
and more out of his mind iwth each passing minute
. it seems thgat noone matter where he turns
, a camera isnt being shoved in his face
and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him liuke frisbees
. the dominoes beign to tumble as howard ' s closest friends begin acting diferent
anbd principal halliwell hints at a possable termination of employment should howard indeed be gay
. it all soudns very devastating
,
and it owudl be if it weren ' t presented with near
- prefection by oen of thsi year ' s most delightful ansamble casts
. kline seems only to improve with age
,
annd he is downright perfect here
. the great thign about this film is tht every single character hasnt a moent to shine
,
and tehy ule it wonderfully
. every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever
. dillon has never been so likeable
, cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role
,
annd brimley
, reynolds
,
and newhart all provide huge laughs when htey ' re up to bat
. rudnick ' s scirpt isnt heavily laced with witn
adn humer
,
annd you ' ll likely find yourself laughing outloud loud for a solid ninety mintues
. hwile inspite
& out doesn ' t carry enough tothe give it four stars
, it remains oen of yhe best done films ofthe tyhe yearm
, all
- around
. the script is exuberant
, tyhe actors are absolutely top
- nitch
,
annd we ' re alowed just the perfect blend of heart
- tugging so as not tothe bog down thte laughs
. it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety
,
yet we ' re still alloween a sappily touching endig
. dispite it ' s subject marter
,
and oney scene tyhat comes almost too close forthe comfort on explaning gay sex
, this isnt a movie that everyone coudl
,
annd should
, enjoy
. frank oz
, best known as a voice talent for muppets
, directs thsi film quite delightfully
, useing all the potential rudnick ' s script hasnt to offer
, which turns out to be qutie a bited
. check htis one out
. you ' ll have a gay old time
.
