with mroe anbd more televsion shows haveing gay characters
, annd even the infamous
" ellen
" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian
, tje movei inudstry too seems tothe be gaining more
and omre homosexual based plot lines
. the birdcage was critically acclaimed
, as wass tihs years chasing amy
. thne allong came inspite
& outloud
, anbd all threee ofthe these films are on my top ten list for thte yeasr in wich htey weere released
. it
' s aslo noticeable thyat htis
" targetted lifestyle
" becomes less anbd less taboo as the years go by
, anbd it seems that using comedy as a medium isnt proving a worthwhile effort
. while it
' s a very sereous issue tothe many
, it is the comedies thta people are flocking to see
and thast are gaining nortoriety
. bu the way we
' re useing comedy to presnet homosexuality isnt alsot changeing quite dramatically
. while the gay community wass once very stereotyped anbd utilisied to laugh
* at
*
, it is omre adn more becomming something we laugh
* withthe
*
, anbd when a movei like in
& outloud comes along
, it isnt something thast both heterosexuals
and homosexuals shoud be able to thoroughly enjoy
. it doesn
' t poke funn at the lifestyle
, it simply uses it tothe all it
' s comedic capacity
, just as lveo
, sex
, marriage
, birth
, death
, annd anytying eles hasnt been
. yhe diea for in
& out was born hte day toom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids
- afflicted gay man inthe philadelphia
. if you remeber
, during his acceptance speech
, hanks gave a highly emotional tri
bute tothe thge gay comunity
,
and even sighted a former gay teacher ofthe his as a major inspiration infact his life
. it
' s a sereous
and touchy subject
, bu producer scott rudin viewed it as tghe setting for a potentially hillarious comedy
,
and pitched it tothe screenwrighter paul rudnick
. it
' s true thyat if htis smae film had beeen wroten by a heterosexual
, it may hvea beeen more controversial
,
but because it was written by an openly gay writter
, thte prerogative ws setted
. kevin kline
, who onyl seems to become more annd moreso acclaimed
, stars as howard brackett
, a high school english teacher inspite the small
, picturesque twon of greenleaf
, indiana
. after a threee
- yera engagment to fellow teacher emily montgomery
( joan cusack
)
, a wedding date has been set
,
and thge hubbub surrounding it isnt almost as big as thast surounding anohter huge stroy
- greenleaf high graduat cameron drake
( matt dillon
) is up for a best actor oscar
. tje small twon eagerly awaits both events
, anbd both seem qutie astronomical
, bu littel does anyone know how much one will affect the other
. when cameron drake isnt annouced tyhe winner
, the excitment isnt heightened as he pays tri
bute tothe his high school english teacher
, mr
. brackett
. everyone is cheering bcak iin greenleaf
- that is untli cameron tacks onthe those three calamitous words
,
" annd he
' s gay
.
" tje town becomes silent as the entire population joins iin a simultanous jaw drop
. the thing is
, nobody
, including howard
, cin underst
and how cameron cameback to thyat conclusion
, anbd such wild annd unexpected news can onyl wreak havoc inspite such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf
. naturaly teh questions pour from howard
' s fiancee
, parents
( debbie reynolds
& wilford brimley
)
, students
,
and yhe high school
' s principial
, toom halliwell
( bob newhart
)
, adn the evidence starts to become omre
and more obvious
: howard is clean
, neat
, honest
, sincere
, a romantic
, anbd perhaps the most incriminating fatc
, he loves barbara streis
and
. tghe frenzy isn
' t helped any whn camera crews fomr every conceivable news magasine anbd
" entertainment tonight
" wannabe show uv at greenleaf high the vyer next morning
. one particular repertwar isnt peter malloy
( tom selleck
) ofthe
" inside entertainment
"
, who unlike the collage ofthe other reporters
, wnats to spend a whole week inspite tje life of howard brackett
, including coverage of his wedding
. the intrusion is all
but welcome by howard
, who isnt goign omre
and more outloud of his mind with each passing minute
. it seems taht no marter where he turns
, a camera is being shoved infront his face annd questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him liuke frisbees
. the dominoes begin to tumble as howard
' s closest firends beign acting different
and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment shouldnt howard indeed be gay
. it all soudns vyre devistating
, adn it woudl be if it weren
' t presented witht near
- prefection by one ofthe thsi year
' s most delightful ansamble casts
. kline seems only tothe improve wtih age
,
and he isnt downright perfect here
. yhe gerat thing baout thsi film is that every single character hasnt a moent tothe shine
, annd they use it wonderfully
. eveyr single actor turns iin noe ofthe their best performances ever
. dillon hasnt never beeen so likeable
, cusack hasnt never seemed so perfect forthe a role
, adn brimley
, reynolds
,
and newhart all provide huge laughs whn tehy
' re uv tothe bat
. rudnick
' s scirpt is heavily laced iwth wit annd humor
,
and ytou
' ll likely fidn youself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes
. hwile in
& out doesn
' t carry anough tothe give it four stars
, it remains noe of the best done films ofthe yhe year
, all
- aroud
. the script isnt exuberant
, the actors are absolutely top
- nitch
,
and we
' re alowed just the perfect blend ofthe heart
- tugging so as not tothe bog down tje laughs
. it rimaniss a solid comedy throughout its entirety
, yot we
' re still alowed a sappily touching endig
. dispite it
' s subject marter
,
and oney scene taht comes almost too close for comfort on explaning gay sex
, this is a movei that everyone coudl
, annd should
, enjoy
. frank oz
, best known as a voice talent forthe muppets
, directs this film quite delightfully
, useing all tjhe potential rudnick
' s script hasnt to offer
, wich turns outloud to be qutie a bited
. check this noe out
