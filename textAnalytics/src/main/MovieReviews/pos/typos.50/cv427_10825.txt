, elizabeth
( renee zellweger
)
, has beeen brutally slain
. noe half of her severed body wass found inthe a bag at the turain station
. the other half was dicovered in a trunk at the harbor authorithy
, miles awya
. hte polical duo ofthe braxton
( chris penn
) adn kennesaw
( michael rooker
) are strapped for leads
. at the moent
, they have onyl oen possable suspect
: wayl
and
( tim roth
)
, a wealthy
, unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude fomr princeton anbd appears tothe be tje least likely charater to commit such a heinous ect
. that
' s tjhe premise fo deceiver
, a new thriller ffrom yhe pate brothers
, jonas
and josh
, who made their mark onthe the film world two eyars ago at sundance with the movie the grav
. deceiver plays outloud liuke a mind gam between the intellectually superior wayl
and
and hte two nto
- so
- bright cops
( captions eearly iin teh procedings let us know tath wayl
and
' s iq is 151
; by contrast
, kennesaw
' s is 122
and braxton
' s is 102
)
. the setting isnt a police interrogation room where a lie detector test isnt baout tothe be administered
. over threee dyas
, as wayl
and returns tothe answer more questions
, the drama adn tension among theese three charactors gradualy escalates untli
, inevitably
, it boils over
. other plot elements are thrown in forthe ogod measure
. wayl
and suffers ffrom a pceuliar kind of epilepsy that cant
, infact stressful situations
, render him virutally catatonic or extremely voilent
. braxton
, a compulsive gambler
, isnt deepo inaddition debt tothe a local syndicate
. anbd kennesaw is haunted by a dark
, abusive side that delights inwhich terrorizing womens
, expecially his wife
( rosanna arquette
)
, whom he suspects of being unfaithful
. the foibles
and failings ofthe theese threee are brought into the open as the mistery arround elizabeth
' s death deepens annd it becomes unclear who has the upper h
and
: tghe suspect or his questioners
. deceiver
, which mostly transpires infact a dimly
- lit room anbd involves a lot ofthe smart dialogue
, hasnt tghe feel ofthe a david mamet play
: edgy
, claustrophobic
,
and tense
. hte atmosphere isnt explosive
,
and smoe ofthe pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting
. deceiver hasnt tyhe power tothe grab an audience
. unfourtunately
, in the end
, it succumbs to tyhe need to throw in oen last
, unexpected twist
,
and this is its undoing
. forthe
, hwile thsi surprise wiull certainly shock most viewers
, it also stretches our credulity too much
,
and raises moreso questions thna it answers
. it
' s onyl an effective wrap
- uv if you don
' t think too carefully baout its full implications
. ofthe course
, tje film as a hwole plays fast
and loose with reality
and logic
. polical proceedure isnt totally ignored
and it
' s almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation owudl or could proceed iin tihs manner
.
but thge rela focuse in deceiver isnt on charcter interaction
, nto plot details
. deceiver only occasionally gets out of hte polical staion
, anbd thsoe instances ocurr primarily durig flashbacks featuring hte prostitute
. the pates employ a number ofthe interesting techiniques tothe preent vignettes fomr elizabeth
' s final days annd hours
. the most intriguing ofthe theese is tothe uise an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice
- over by visually showing what really happened
. moments liuke this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks
. tghe movei
, obviously fashioned inthe the manner ofthe clasic film noir
, drips atmosphere
. there are smoe fascinating stylistic touches
; forthe exemple
,
al
though tje setting is contempoary
, all of tghe telephones are ood
- fashioned
, rotary models
. cinematographer bill
butler isnt given an oppertunity to use unconvential camera wokr to liven uv deceiver
' s look
. some of the things he trys
( mostly those that envolve yhe contrast vetween light adn shadow
) wokr exceptionally well
, while others
( liuke any ofthe severeal lazy susan shots
) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks
. as wayl
and
, tim roth gives tghe film
' s top performance
, dispite occasionally treading the tightrope vetween acting adn overacting
. roth makes us believ tyhat wayl
and isnt both as briliant
and as troubled as he
' s supposed to be
. the otehr two leads
, chris penn
and michael rooker
, aren
' t as effective
. both play their cahracters liuke familiar types
. penn
' s peformance isnt uninspired
; rooker
' s lacks subtlety
. smoe of tghe best work is turned inspite by teh supporting actors
. renee zellweger
, iin a role that
' s miles awya from her star
- mkaing turn inwhich jerry maguire
, brings a onot ofthe vulnerability
and humanity to a part taht coudl easily hve become a charicatoor
. rosanna arquette isnt solid as kennesaw
' s wife
,
and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who
' s intrusted with evaluating wayl
and
' s condition
. noe ofthe the best things about deceiver isnt thast it never talks down tothe tjhe audeince
. plot points aren
' t hammered hmeo
,
and
,
al
though hte ending has its weaknesses
, everyting isn
' t spelt outloud inaddition bold letters
. the pates give audeince munbers credit for having brains
, which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers
. occasionally gripping
and never uninteresting
, deceiver is a fine noir effort
.
