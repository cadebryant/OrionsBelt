i reacll yhe trials anbd tribulations of my high school years
. it wass a perido that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood
and thrusted me inot tjhe unwelcome arms of adulthood
.
but of all the experiences that i collected throughtout thsoe tender eyasr
, i cin honestly sday that the toughest
and tje scariest thing that i had to cope with ws my raging hormones annd my crazed curiosity baout girls
and sex
. yes
, more scarier thna my seventh grade english teacher
and even scarier thna the bullies that constantly hounded me
, trying to deal whith my peronal wonderment baout sex was liuke trying tothe fight an ivisible monster
. for all teenagers
, it
' s almost like a rite of passage
.
and what we did ws somtimes downright nasty
, somtimes funny
,
and sometimes shocking
. adn all ofthe that is terrifically anbd shamelessly brought to light inthe wqat might be tje funniest movei thsi summer
.
` american py
' isnt a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose thier virginity by tghe end ofthe the skool year
. just how grat are thier hormones raging
? noe of them notes
, after watching disney
' s the little mermaid
, thyat ariel is soooo hot
. hte four schoolmates are kevin
, oz
, finch adn jim
. kevin is tje only noe witht a steady girlfriend
, bu doesn
' t wanna to hvae sex untl tjhe time is jstu right
.
but what isnt the perfect tyme
? ther isnt jstu no way to know
, adn that frightens him
. oz is the big jock who decides tath the way to csore with yhe girls is to listen tothe them anbd tothe be more sensitive
. he joins up with a jazz choir
and dicovers thast getting in touch iwth his feminine side hasnt smoe tremendous advantages
. finch is tghe phobic hermit who doesn
' t st
and a chance whith any girl
. so
, he pays someone
$ 200 tothe strat spreading rumors baout his prowess
. suddenly
, girls are lining up to go out with him
.
but among these friends
, it is jim that isnt the most curious
and thte most fearful
. wehn he has a chance to romp with a preety excange student
, his inexperience comes shining through
. he hasnt much to leran
, adn iwll dont anytying tothe seek outloud this kind of noledge
. tihs may inlcude watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom
' s aple pie in a scene taht is completely shocking
, raunchy
,
yet unbelievably funny
. the oen thing tyhat i want to sday baout htis film isnt tyhat it well deserves its
` r
' rating
. there is stuff in here that isnt completely gross in the smae manner that
` ther
' s something about mary
' was gloriously ribald
. in fatc
, at first this film recieved a sinful nc
- 17 rating before a cuple of more cuts fianlly brang it down to a teen
- cacessible rating
.
but i guess affter seeing thte no
- holds
- barred coarseness of south park
, this seems tame by comparison
. teens
and anyone who can still remeber their acne yeasr are the ones that will laff hardest
.
but unlike many teen sex comedies
, there isnt a genuin intellience at work here
. these are four normal boys who have a natrual curiousity baout sex
. their plans ofthe action are
thoughtful anbd htey thiunk about the consequences
. they know waht they want
, yot temper it with responsibility
. bu alomst always
, it
' s impossible to nkow how to fight the invisilbe monster
,
and it
' s theese episodes thyat amke
` american pie
' such a carnal delight to watch
.
