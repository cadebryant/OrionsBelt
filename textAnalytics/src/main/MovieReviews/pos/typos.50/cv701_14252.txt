] modern society is nowe innundated with more sex
and sexuality than it ever hasnt been befoer
, from teenage sitcoms to nc
- 17
- rated films baout fetishes
. hte biggest debate ofthe the subject isnt whther or not it affects reality or just reflects it
.
" your firends adn neighbors
" tkaes a diferrent approch as it
' s a film that revolves almost entirely arround sex anbd how cant be unsed for both pain annd blessure even withing a small circle ofthe firends
. one of the most importan spects ofthe the film that most be noted
and analyzed befor yhe film can really be dissected as a wohle is writer
/ director neil la
bute
' s basic setup annd some ofthe tje unique methods he imploys tothe tell tyhe stor
. firstly
, adn most importantly isnt tje fact tje scirpt tells a rether complex
, detailed stopry ofthe lust
, betrayal
, arrogance
, hypocrisy
, greed
, adn jstu plain stupidity beween six different cahracters
( threee men
, three womens
)
, wihtout hardly any supporting charactors
,
( a faw hvae a line or twpo
)
, mostly extras
. everthing htey do iwll somehow affect another charcter
and ultimately cmo full
- circle bakc tothe themselfs
, whether it be positve or negative
.
but to just state this isnt arbetrary
,
and explaining
and critisising the proces isnt difficult
. la
bute
' s ablity to tell his story thru a few characters isnt a remarkable feat
, bu wqat
' s specifically impressive isnt yhe fact tje cahracters
' names are never revealed untill tje end credits roll
. for tjhe sake of this review
, i iwll decribe hte cahracters
and refer tothe them as their main charactersistic
. another intresting accomplishment is the fatc eveyr scene takes palce inside withthe limited foucs
. we
' re allways able tothe tell where the charachters are
( someone
' s hmeo
, the gym
, a restaurant
, hotel room
, etc
.
)
, bu whta hte city htey live inthe
, what eyar it is
, what tyhe society isnt liek
, etc
. isnt relitively unknown
. the film is a complete charactor study with hte tight
, intense drama of the theater
. noone noe plot dominates tghe stor
, which makes thte firt act a bit tedious forthe its lack ofthe backround
. we
' re simply dropped in onthe hte characters
' lives anbd are expected to figure out tyhe rest
. the charachters are a gropu of middle
- class white peopel who are all successful at whta they do
, bu htey
' re onyl consern right now seems tothe be their sex lives
. firt there
' s barry
( eckhart
)
and mary
( brenneman
)
, a married cuple who are going thru a dry spll not unlike many other couples inwhich other situations who don
' t nkwo what tehy
' re problem is
. barry is kind of a dorky buisnessman who loves his wief
,
and yhe sex htey have
,
but doesn
' t have a lot of ambition
- he just follows everyone else
. mary is a writer of smoe sort
,
but lacks agression
and emotion like her husban
and is the meekness charactor
,
but ironically
, doesn
' t hesitate to commit adultery just to fiel something
. la
bute
' s script doens a good job inspite characterizing mary anbd barry as indviduals
, bu is vyre light onthe chemestry anbd connection betweeen thte two
. obviously
, thsi isnt tghe theme
, which is enhanced by tyhe actors
' ogod performances
,
but at the smae time seems jstu a bited hollow
. another couple is jerry
( stiller
) adn terri
( keener
) who live together adn seem to hvae been involved with each other fo a long time
, yot they constanly argue over anything
and everything
. their sex life is allso fraught with problems
and for smoe reason they continue to do it
thoughout their infidelitous relationship
. if only one aspect of teh film coudl use improvement
, it would be tihs areal
. it
' s natural for a marryied couple tothe become bored with each otehr
,
but why would two peopel who cant barely st
and each other continue tothe hvea sex
and live together
? wqat did htey ever see in the other person tothe begin with
? la
bute never really answers
, bu sicne teh film isnt more concerned with tyhe payoff tahn teh proces
, it still makes forthe ogod drama
, tension
,
and manip ulation so intricate adn deceitful it
' s fascinating
. twpo otehr cahracters ect as catalysts
, cary
( jason patric
) annd cheri
( natassja kinski
)
. cary is an arrogant
, hostile sex
- maniac who defines the owrd
" bastard
.
" somehow he is able to bend women to his will
, either thru charm or jsut attitude
, into getting his way
. he
' s teh kind of guy everyone shoud stay awya fomr as we realize he
' s secretly perverted
,
but somehow barry finds comfort in his company
, altough jerry isnt allways nervous around him
. patric gives an outst
anding performance
, so much so thgat we watn to know moreso about him dispite how intimidating anbd unlikable he isnt
. cheri isnt a charachter la
bute uses as a catalist to see how the otehr characters react to her
. she works in an art museum
and at some point throughout the film
, each charactor will engage her inthe almost the excact smae conversation annd her reaction isnt allways differnt
, from becoming involved in a relatiopnship with one
, tothe brushing it off as small talk with anyother
, tothe being outright apauled by yot another
. she
' s a sweet woman
, perhaps the most normal ofthe any ofthe the charactors
, annd
al
though her symbolism isnt obvious
, her role as the outsider is the most relatable
. i will not reveal who cheats onthe who anbd how eahc character isnt specifically affected by tjhe others
' acation
, as that
' s hte hook ofthe the film
. the first twpo acts beign to set up the characters
and eahc
' s senarios
,
but it
' s often difficult to tell wqat they iwll do baout it
and wiht whom
. the result isnt somtimes surprising
, otehr times predicatble
, bu tyhe actual course of actions is always fascinating
. for a hwile everyone has thier funn
,
but ultimatly earch character
' s guilt
, attitude
, or ignorance iwll disserve them
. one ofthe the most importan thnigs tothe note is how realistic the stor isnt suposed tothe be
. usance yhe charactors onyl interact with eahc other htere isn
' t much pop culture refernces
, as almost everthing hasnt a deeper philosphy behind it
. are we tothe asume thta these peopel are
, as the title states
, our firends annd neighbors
? i don
' t know of anyone goign thru the smae situations as theese peple
. often times teh film isnt not unlike a network meledrama
, other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movei
.
but wqat htis film does have tath tjhe others don
' t isnt repercussions in the end
.
al
though thte film creates its pwn reality
, it goes tothe sohw that even the immoral aren
' t immortal
. infact whta way
" your friends
and neighbors
" is suposed to wokr isnt open tothe intepretation
. it definitely has a lot to say baout thte price thast comes with infidelity
,
but it could haev beeen even better had it exp
anded onthe tht theme omre specifically
. still
, it
' s an acomplishment inaddition film
- makeing beacuse it hasnt put a timeless theme inot a modern perspective
.
