] modern society is nowe inundated whith more sex
annd sexuality than it ever hasnt beeen befoer
, from teenage sitcoms to nc
- 17
- rated films about fetishes
. tjhe biggest debate ofthe the subject is whther or nto it affects reality or jsut reflects it
.
" your firends
adn neighbors
" tkaes a differnt aproach as it ' s a film taht revolves allmost entirely arround sex
anbd how can be utilizied fo both pain
and pleasure even within a small circle of friends
. one ofthe tyhe most important aspects ofthe thte film thta most be noted
adn analyzed before the film cant realyl be dissected as a hwole isnt writer
/ director neil labute ' s basic setup
adn soem of teh unique methods he imploys tothe tell hte stry
. firstly
,
and most importantly is the fatc the scirpt tells a rether complex
, detailed sotry of lust
, betrayal
, arrogance
, hypocrisy
, greed
,
adn just plain stupidity vetween six diffrent characters
( threee men
, threee women
)
, without hardly any supporting cahracters
,
( a few have a line or twpo
)
, mostly extras
. everything they do will somehow affect anohter charcter
and ultimately come full
- circle back tothe themselves
, whther it be positve or negitive
.
but tothe just state htis is arbitrary
,
and explaining
and criticizing tghe process isnt difficult
. labute ' s ability to tell his stroy thru a few charachters isnt a remarkable feat
,
but wqat ' s specifically impressive isnt tghe fact tjhe characters ' names are never revealed unil the end credits roll
. for hte sake ofthe this review
, i wiull discribe tghe cahracters
adn refer tothe them as theri main characteristic
. another intresting acomplishment is thte fact every scene tkaes place inside with limited focus
. we ' re alwyas able to tell where the charactors are
( somone ' s home
, the gym
, a restaurant
, hotel room
, etc
.
)
,
bu what tje city tehy live iin
, what eyar it is
, what the society is liek
, etc
. isnt relativly unknown
. hte film is a complet character studdy wtih tjhe tight
, intense drama ofthe thte theather
. no oney plot dominates tghe tsory
, which makes teh firt ect a bited tedeous for its lack of backround
. we ' re simply dropped in on the charachters ' lives
and are expeced tothe figure out yhe rest
. thte characters are a group ofthe middle
- clas white peopel who are all successful at what tehy dont
,
bu htey ' re onyl concern right nowe seems tothe be thier sex lives
. first there ' s barry
( eckhart
)
adn mary
( brenneman
)
, a marryied cuple who are going thru a dry sepll not unlike many other couples inthe otehr situations who don ' t know whta htey ' re problem is
. barry is kind of a dorky buisnessman who loves his wife
,
annd the sex they hve
,
but doesn ' t haev a lot ofthe ambition
- he just follows everyone else
. mary isnt a writter ofthe some sort
,
but lacks agression
anbd emotion like her husband
and is the meekness character
,
bu ironicaly
, doesn ' t hesitate tothe commit adultery just to feel something
. labute ' s script doens a ogod job in characterizing mary
annd barry as individuals
,
bu is very light onthe chemistry
annd connection between the two
. obviously
, tihs is the theme
, whic is enhanced by thge actors ' ogod performances
,
bu at thte same time seems jsut a bited hollow
. anyother couple isnt jerry
( stiller
)
annd terri
( keener
) who live toghether
and seem tothe hvea beeen involved with earch otehr forthe a long time
,
yot they constanly argue over anytying
and everthing
. thier sex life is also fraught with problems
adn fo some reason tehy continue tothe dont it throughout their infidelitous relationship
. if only oney aspect of the film coudl use improvment
, it would be tihs areal
. it ' s natural for a marryied couple to become bored with each other
,
but why owudl two people who cant bearly stand each otehr continue tothe haev sex
anbd live toghether
? whta doed htey ever see in the other person tothe beign with
? labute never really answers
,
bu sicne yhe film is more conserned wiht tyhe payoff tahn the process
, it still makes forthe good drama
, tension
,
anbd manip ulation so intricate
and deceitful it ' s fascinating
. two other characters ect as catalysts
, cary
( jason patric
)
annd cheri
( natassja kinski
)
. cary isnt an arrogant
, hostile sex
- maniac who defines tyhe owrd
" bastard
.
" somehow he isnt able tothe bend womens to his wiull
, eather through charm or jsut atitude
, into getting his way
. he ' s the kind of guy everyone should stay awya ffrom as we realize he ' s secretly perverted
,
bu somehow barry finds comfort infact his comany
, altho jerry is alwasy nervous arund him
. patric gives an oustanding performence
, so much so that we whant to know more baout him despite how intimidating
and unlikable he isnt
. cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst tothe see how yhe otehr charachters react to her
. she works inaddition an art museum
and at some point throughtout the film
, each character will engage her inwhich almost tjhe exact same conversation
anbd her reaction is always different
, fomr becoming involved in a relatiopnship iwth oen
, tothe brushing it off as small talk with anohter
, to being outright apauled by
yet another
. she ' s a sweet woman
, perhasp tyhe most normal ofthe any of tghe cahracters
,
annd
altough her symbolism isnt obvious
, her role as tghe outsider is tje most relatable
. i will not reveal who cheats onthe who
anbd how eahc chracter isnt specifically affected by the others ' action
, as that ' s the hook ofthe the film
. the first twpo acts beign to setted up yhe characters
adn each ' s senarios
,
but it ' s oftenly difficult tothe tell what tehy will dont baout it
and witht whom
. hte result isnt somtimes suprizing
, other times predicatble
,
but the actuall course ofthe actions isnt alwyas fascinating
. for a hwile everyone hasnt their funn
,
but ultimately earch charachter ' s guilt
, attitude
, or ignorance wiull disserve them
. oen of the most importamt things tothe onot isnt how realistic thte stroy is supposted to be
. since tje characters onyl interact with each otehr htere isn ' t much pop culture refernces
, as allmost everything hasnt a deeper philisophy behind it
. are we to asume tyhat theese people are
, as thte title states
, our firends
and neighbors
? i don ' t know of anyone going through the same situations as theese people
. often times thte film isnt not unlike a network meledrama
, other times situations are liuke thsoe nto seen outside a porno movie
.
bu whta this film doesnt have that tyhe others don ' t isnt repercussions in the end
.
althought the film creates its own reality
, it goes to sohw thta even the immoral aren ' t immortal
. in waht way
" your firends
and neighbors
" isnt supposed tothe work is ope to intepretation
. it definitely has a lot to say baout the price that comes with infidelity
,
but it sould ahve beeen even better had it expanded onthe that theme mroe specifically
. still
, it ' s an accomplishment in film
- making becasue it hasnt put a timeless theme inot a modern prespective
.
