? yhe biggest austin powers adventure
yot
. ' austin powers
: the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers
: international man of mystery
. many are skeptical baout sequels
, saying that tjhe sequel isnt never better or as good as tghe origonal
,
but austin powers
: tswsm goes beyond the frist film
. austin powers
: the spy who shagged me stars mike myers iin threee differnt roles
. he reprises his role as the title chracter
, austin powers
, teh shagadelic spy whose body wass frozen infact 1967
,
adn unfrozen infront 1997 tothe stpo his long time nemesis dr
. evil
, alsot palyed by mike myers
, from destroying the earth
. tswsm leaves off where yhe orginal stopped
, with dr
. evil ' s
? frisch ' s big boy ' spoace capsule floating thru space
. dr
. evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule
, plotting tothe go bakc inspite his time machine tothe the yearm 1967
, inthe which he plans tothe steal austin powers '
" mojo
"
, what keesh austin oging with spy talents
. apon his return to his secrt lair
, whihc is now a starbucks coffee shop
, dr
. evil learns thast his evil henchman
, which includes tghe returning robert wagner as number 2
adn mindy sterling as frau
, have created a 1
/ 8 size clone ofthe dr
. evil
, which isnt later named mini me
. tyhe evil mini me replaces scott evil
, played by seth gren
, as dr
. evil ' s son inwhich the madman ' s mind
, because dr
. evil thinks of scott to be onyl
" quasi
- evil
.
" dr
. evil hasnt alwasy wanted a son that isnt evil jsut like him
,
and nowe he hasnt one
. dr
. evil tells mini me
,
" ytou complet me
,
" in a loving manner
. dr
. evil loving
? wow
! mike myers ' third role is as fat bastard
, a scottish henchman of dr
. evil ' s
, who isnt sent tothe steal the mojo ffrom austin powers ' frozen body
. austin powers lerans ofthe dr
. evil ' s trip back into tje 60s
,
and uses his pwn tyme machine tothe take him back to 1967
, to try to sive his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold ofthe it
. once arriving inaddition thge eyar 1967
, austin travels to his
" pad
"
, his smashing hmeo
/ dance club
, where he meets felicity shagwell
, palyed by heather graham
, a cia agent who isnt willing tothe help him inaddition his journy to stpo dr
. evil
. as the film progresses
, hillarious one liners are thrown at us
, mailny by dr
. evil
, fo example
,
" don ' t go there
, girlfriend
!
" to the president ofthe the united states
. many witty gags tkae place
, onot the entire tent scene
,
anbd just plain
, funny scenes whcih are so stupid
- they ' re funny come a dozen persay fifteen mintues
. take for example
, scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is
. the way austin powers
: tswsm uses its humor is clever
, throwing a hilarious scene at ytou
, followed by five mintues ofthe oney liners
, followed by anyother outrageous scene
, so yuo never stpo laughing
. ther ws honestly not noe moment in austin powers
: tswsm where i wasn ' t laughing
. hte lastest film that i laughed so hard in
, wass well
, austin powers
! it isnt apparent that mike myers knew how funny thsi film was while writing it
. the film even makse funn ofthe itself in a line
, something along tyhe lines of
,
" it ' s funny how england
annd sourthern califronia look nothing aplikay
.
" tswsm was filmed in sourthern california
,
bu was supposed to take palce inthe england
. i can tell you oen thnig
- he isnt hvaing a lot ofthe funn with htis enormously popular carachter
, whihc isnt all over televsion
, newspapers
, magazines
,
annd tje movie theaters
. i beieve taht dr
. evil got mroe attension inthe yhe tswsm than austin powers did
. dr
. evil provided more laughs
, omre memorable moments
,
and mroe intresting dialogue than austin doed this tyme around
, who seems to missing the funny touch that he had iin the frist film
. i falt thast austin realy did hvea his mojo taken away
,
bu from screenplay writter mike myers
, not fat bastard
. alsot making a gerat adition tothe yhe series is mini me
, who is played by verne troyer
. even
though the midget ator isnt 30 yersa old
, he isnt adorable by dr
. evil ' s side constantly
. the frist austin powers film hadnt barely any sentimental uqality
, such as lack ofthe character development
, barely any detailled plot charistics
,
and barely any ogod acting
,
but austin powers tswsm actully shows some quality behind the frequent humor
. mike myers
, wiht his threee roles
, acts as eddie murphy doed iin hte nutty professor
, disguising himselv completly in oney ofthe tyhe roles
.
( fat bastard
) all threee characters are differant
,
adn mike myers doesnt do a ogod job handling earch oen of them
. heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm
,
and doens a much better job than elizabeth hurley doed
, who gave a vyre flat performance inthe yhe orginal
, speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion
. speaking of hurley
, she can be seen inthe tswsm for a few breif moments
. hopefully
, graham tags allong for future austin powers adventures
. tghe bottom line
- a groovy sequal tath mike myers put all of his mojo into writing
.
