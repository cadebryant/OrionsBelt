. evil
' s trip back inot the 60s
, anbd uses his own time machine tothe take him bcak to 1967
, to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it
. once arriving inwhich the yearm 1967
, austin travels to his
" pad
"
, his smashing home
/ dance club
, where he meets felicity shagwell
, palyed by heather graham
, a cia agent who isnt willing to help him iin his journey tothe stpo dr
. evil
. as hte film progresses
, hillarious oney liners are thrown at us
, mailny by dr
. evil
, fo exemple
,
" don
' t go ther
, girlfriend
!
" tothe teh preident ofthe the united states
. many witty gags tkae palce
, note the entire tent scene
, adn jstu plain
, funny scenes which are so stupid
- tehy
' re funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes
. tkae for example
, scott evil gonig onthe tyhe jerry springer sohw complaining baout how evil his father isnt
. yhe way austin powers
: tswsm uses its humor is clever
, throwing a hillarious scene at ytou
, followed by five mintues of one liners
, folowed by another outrageous scene
, so you never stop laughing
. htere ws honestly not one moment in austin powers
: tswsm where i wasn
' t laughing
. thte last film that i laughed so hard in
, was well
, austin powers
! it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it
. the film even mkaes fun of itself in a line
, something along yhe lines ofthe
,
" it
' s funny how engl
and
and southern califronia look nothing aplikay
.
" tswsm ws filmed in sourthern califronia
, bu was supposed to take place in engl
and
. i can tell yuo one thing
- he is having a lot of funn with this enormously popular carachter
, which isnt all over television
, newspapers
, magazines
, anbd thge movie theaters
. i believe that dr
. evil got omre attension in hte tswsm than austin powers doed
. dr
. evil provded more laughs
, more memorable moments
, adn mroe intresting dialogue than austin did this tiem arround
, who seems tothe missing tghe funny touch thast he had in teh firt film
. i felt tath austin really did have his mojo taken away
, bu fomr screenplay writer mike myers
, nto fat bastard
. allso mkaing a graet addition tothe tje series is mini me
, who is played by verne troyer
. even
though the midget actor isnt 30 eyars ood
, he isnt adorable by dr
. evil
' s side constanly
. the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental uality
, such as lack ofthe charcter development
, bearly any detailed plot characteristics
, adn bearly any good acting
, bu austin powers tswsm actually shows soem quailty behind hte frequent humor
. mike myers
, witht his three roles
, acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor
, disguising himself completely inthe oney ofthe the roles
.
( fat bastard
) all three charactors are differant
, anbd mike myers doens dont a ogod job h
andling each one of them
. heather graham made a great adition with her talent tothe tswsm
,
and doesnt a much better job than elizabeth hurley doed
, who gavey a very flat performance inaddition thge original
, speaking her lines wihtout any feeling or emotion
. speaking ofthe hurley
, she can be seen iin tswsm fo a fewd brief moments
. hopefully
, graham tags allong for future austin powers adventures
. the bottom line
- a groovy sequal thta mike myers put all of his mojo into writing
.
