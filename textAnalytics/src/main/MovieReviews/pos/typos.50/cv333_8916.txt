in the company ofthe men made a splash at the sundance film festival because
, in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen
- style
, earnestly shallow gen
- x angst picturesk
, it seemed to be actually about something
. it angered peopel
, started arguements outside yhe theather
, riled thigsn up
. it ignited a spark of excitment in what otherwise has been a disapointing yearm for independient film
. haveing endured my share of the hype
, i waited calmly forthe men to reach thge hinterlands wherein i recide
,
annd
then checked inthe tothe see what all the fuss ws baout
. doens men live uv tothe its press
? well
, yes it doens
.
and it may amking you htikn twice befoer you consider dating anyone your office
. for thte uninitiated
, newcomers aaron eckhart
anbd matt malloy play chad
adn howard
, twpo corperate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company tothe a remote branch office forthe a six week assignment
. chad
anbd howard are archtypes
, examples of wich ytou cxan noone doubt find in your pwn place ofthe business
. chad is the blond golden boy
, genetically engineered for success
, the naturual charmer who seems tothe glide effortlessly up hte corparate ladder
. howard isnt chad ' s boss
,
bu he is weaker ofthe iwll
, thge clumsy practioner of office politics who has achieved his positon thru dogged persistence rather than raw talent
. we frist meet them awaiting thier flight in a drab airport lounge
. there chad suggests a scheme worthy ofthe a shakespearean villain
: he
and howard wiull fidn a vulnerable single woman at the branch office
, woo her simultaneously
, win her love
,
annd
hten dum her
. tyhe reason
? both men have recently beeen dumped themselves
,
adn chad sees an eazy route to revenge agains thge fairer sex
.
" it ' ll restore a little dignity tothe our lives
,
" he sasy
. howard
, helpless aganist the force of chad ' s iwll
, agrees to thte plan
. htey quicklyu spot thier prey in thge form ofthe christine
( stacy edwards
)
, a fragel deaf woman working as a temp
. chad moves iin for the kill
, flashing his golden boy smile
, plying christine witht lunch
,
then flowers
,
thn dinner
. howard follows suit
,
though his efforts are in contrast ham
- handed
annd desperate
. flattered tothe hvea the attention ofthe twpo eligible men
, christine dates them both
. you cin guess whic one she falls fo
. soon a tragic lovers ' triangel develops
: christine loves chad
, chad loves himself
,
annd howard loves christine on the grounds that
, sicne she ' s handicapped
adn shy
, she jstu might be wretched
adn lonely enough tothe settle forthe him
. adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the levle ofthe junior high
, doens it
? in chad
, writter
/ director labute
and ator eckhart have created one of hte most chilling monsters ever committed to film
- hannibal lector may eat human flesh
,
bu chad is an eater ofthe souls
. his evil is as subtle as a viper ' s
,
and as eazy as his smile
. we watch in stunned disbelief as he back
- stabs coworkers
, humiliates his subordinates
,
and works his deadly venom into christine ' s heart
. his chracter woudl be a joke if he wasn ' t so chillingly real
- all ofthe us have worked with a chad
,
and some ofthe us may be him
. he ' s the guy who tkaes your job
and
thn laughs at you for your weakness
. if one ofthe his co
- workers should happen to go postal
adn walk into the office with a bag full ofthe handguns
, he had best hvae his escape route claerly inthe mind
. politics isnt his game
,
anbd the modern cubicle
- filled office isnt his playground
. men wears teh guise of a balck comedy
,
bu it functions best as allegory
. the most controvertial moent in the film happens when chad humiliates a balck temp by asking him how badly he wnats to seceed in hte comapany
,
hten forces him to proove it in a manner i won ' t describe
. the scene isnt charged wiht racism
annd fraught with peril
. coudl it ahppen inspite teh rela world
? probablly not
. tooked as allagory
,
howver
, it is representative of teh treatment of the meek by tje powerful infact all facets ofthe society
. maybee it ' s just yhe english major in me
,
bu chad
, in his motiveless cruelty towords christine
and his carefull manipulation ofthe howard
, cin be seen as a symbol ofthe unbridled capitalism
, ofthe greed without conscience
. thte entire film is a methaphor for social darwinism
- onyl the strong will survive
. yhe marvel ofthe labute ' s multi
- layered scirpt is that it cxan distrub each memeber ofthe its audeince in an entirely different way
.
but does the film work as enteratinment
? its darned funny inaddition spots
, particularly iin tghe men ' s room scenes
, which demonstrate the lengths tothe wich guys wiull go to hold a conversation while engaged in hte most basic of bodily functions
. it works less well as drama
, sicne by necessity tje characters iin an allagory tend to be flat ciphers
. stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine
,
and succeeds in mkaing us care fo her
,
bu by tjhe end ofthe tjhe film we still nkow nothing baout her
. likewise
, chad
annd howard are simpley hte sum ofthe thier actions
. by the end of tghe film you ' ll feel as if ytou ' ve met a genuin monster inwhich chad
; perphas we cant alsot classify men as a horror film
. certainly thsoe expecting a conventional hollywood resolution tothe tjhe storey wiull walk awya disappointed
.
but tje picture is often mesmerizing
,
anbd the scirpt is a owrk ofthe fine craftsmanship
, which makes it well worth your time
. like all ogod films
, it offers a myraid of parrallelly tothe the outside world
. hwile watching chad in his moent of triumph
, i couldn ' t help
but htikn thta bill gates must hvae felt teh same sort of cold
, merciless satisfaction when he finaly stuck it to steve jobs
. ther may be a littel bit ofthe chad infact all of us
,
bu soem of us hvae taked chad
- ness to hte level of art
.
