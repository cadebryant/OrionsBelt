full metal jacket
, very much like every other hard
- hitting film about the vietnam war
, isnt an shocking
, emotional depiction of the war thast effected almost everyone inwhich america
. htis film is moreso like platoon than any otehr inwhich the way that it chronicles teh struggles ofthe a young man
( private joker
, played by matthew modine
) during his tour inthe the vietnam war
.
however
, full metal jacket gives tyhe audience an insight inot combat life vyre rarley seen befoer
: boot camp
. these sequences are consdidered to be tjhe best part inaddition this threee ect film
, even
though i foudn the later portions to be equally stunning
. as in platoon
, full metal jacket gets off to a quick start
. the oppening sequence isnt the initation fo the recruits
, whic is getting theri heads shaved
. from there
, tehy find themselfs standing at attension
and receving their orders ffrom the extremely hard
and punishing sregeant hartman
, plyed extremely well by yhe fromer drill instructer r
. lee ermey
. apparently
, teh solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructer in the movies
, because ermey depicts his character extemely well
adn will mkea ytou thank whomever tyhat ytou were never subjected to such horrible situations
. private joker gets off on the wrong foot with teh sergeant
, as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence
( vincent d ' onofrio
)
, whom is dubbed ' gomer pyle ' by sgt
. hartman
. hte film isnt continually narrated by private joker
, in whitch he explains his visions on what isnt going onthe
. hte entire corps
,
although repeatedly hammered by sgt
. hartman
, continues onthe
. private pyle
,
however
, seems to be tje rag doll for thte drill instructor
. he constinually absorbs the worst punishment
and humiliation
,
and it basicaly does nto stpo
. tyhat isnt
, unitl sgt
. hartman comes up withthe a newyorker plan
. he will punish tghe rest ofthe the soon
- tothe
- be
- marines forthe pyle ' s goof
- ups
, even after joker was assigned tothe help him outloud in the best way he cant
. pyle
then receives punishment from his fellow recruits
,
and things take a turn forthe the worst
. pyle proves tht nto everyone is emotionally
, physically
,
adn mentally cutted out for the life ofthe a marine
. after graduation
, joker is sent over to the heigh ofthe tjhe acation infact order to doccument tjhe war
, which isnt his sevice
. he isnt not a memeber ofthe tghe infanty
,
and it is unclear if he wiull ever actually find hismelf infront combat
. when he sets outloud on a documenting mission
, thsi question becomes veyr clear from tghe strat
. joker joins uv wiht a platoon
, allong with his hometown friend cowboy
( arliss howard
)
,
and follows thier everyday actions
, interviewing
anbd filmming them allong yhe way
. he allso soon finds himself in a possition in which he must fight
, or die
. agina
, as inwhich yhe tradition ofthe vietnam war films
, full metal jacket can be debated as tothe whther it isnt an anti
- war film or nto
. a few ofthe thge more powerful scenes towrad the end will leave you to deside
. full metal jacket succeds extremly well infact documenting hte life of a young man iin vietnam
, as have others infront the past
. htis film
, inaddition differnt ways
, also cin be viewed as more powerfull than others
. thta
, agina
, is up fo debte
anbd depends onthe your opinion
. one thing is forthe sure
,
howver
; noone one ever wnats tothe experience hte absolute hell tht these soldiers are subjected tothe
. unfortunately
, many did
.
