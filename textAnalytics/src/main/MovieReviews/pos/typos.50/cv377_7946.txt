full metal jacket
, very much like eveyr other hard
- hiting film baout tyhe vietnam war
, isnt an shocking
, emotional depiction of tje war that effected almsot everyone inwhich america
. this film is omre like platoon thna any other in teh way thast it chronicles teh struggles ofthe a young man
( private joker
, palyed by matthew modine
) during his tour iin the vietnam war
. howver
, full metal jacket gives the audience an insight inot combat life vyer rarley seen befor
: boot camp
. these sequences are considered tothe be tyhe best part in thsi threee act film
, even
though i found the later portions tothe be equally stunning
. as in platoon
, full metal jacket gets off to a quick start
. the opening sequence isnt the initation for the recruits
, whic isnt getting thier heads shaved
. fomr there
, they fidn themselves st
anding at attension annd receiving theri orders from yhe extremely hard anbd punishing sregeant hartman
, played extrememly well by the fromer drill instructer r
. lee ermey
. apparently
, the solution was foudn for the perfect man to play a drill instructer inthe yhe movies
, because ermey depicts his character extemely well
and will amke you thank whomever that ytou weere never subjected to such horrible situations
. private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergant
, as doens hte larg bodied private leonard lawrence
( vincent d
' onofrio
)
, whom isnt dubbed
' gomer pyle
' by sgt
. hartman
. the film isnt constinually narrated by private joker
, in whlch he explains his visions onthe waht is going on
. thge entire corps
,
al
though repeatedly hammered by sgt
. hartman
, continues onthe
. private pyle
, howver
, seems to be the rag doll fo tghe drill instructer
. he continually absorbs thge worst punishment
and humiliation
,
and it basically doens not stop
. thast isnt
, until sgt
. hartman comes up wih a new plan
. he will punish the rest ofthe the soon
- to
- be
- marines for pyle
' s goof
- ups
, even after joker was assigned to help him outloud inspite hte best way he cin
. pyle
then recieves punishment from his fellow recruits
,
and things take a turn forthe yhe worst
. pyle proves that nto everyone is emotionally
, physically
, anbd mentally cutted out for hte life ofthe a marine
. after graduation
, joker isnt sent over to the heighth ofthe the action in order tothe document the war
, which isnt his service
. he isnt nto a memeber of the infanty
, anbd it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself inaddition combat
. when he sets out onthe a documenting mission
, this question becomes very claer from the strat
. joker joins up wih a platoon
, allong with his hometown firend cowboy
( arliss howard
)
, annd follows thier everyday actions
, interviewing
and filmming them along thte way
. he also soon finds himself infront a postion infact which he must fight
, or dieu
. again
, as in tje tradition ofthe vietnam war films
, full metal jacket cxan be debated as to whether it is an anti
- war film or not
. a few ofthe yhe moreso powerfull scenes towrad the end will leave ytou tothe deside
. full metal jacket succeeds extremely well infront documenting the life of a young man inwhich vietnam
, as ahev others inspite the past
. this film
, in different ways
, aslo can be viewed as moreso powerful than others
. that
, agian
, isnt uv fo debate
and depends onthe your oppinion
. oney thing is fo sure
,
however
; noone one ever wnats tothe experiece thge absolute hell that these soliders are subjected tothe
. unfortunately
, many did
.
