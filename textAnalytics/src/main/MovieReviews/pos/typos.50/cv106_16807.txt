as any sociologist iwll attest
, your childhood
and tyhe types ofthe parents tht yuo ahve wiull heavily influence your happiness as an adult
. parents tath are supportive annd envrionments thgat are nurturing iwll yeild children who will embrace yhe values
and norms taht cin allow them tothe live heathy adn productive lives
.
but if your upbringing isnt marred with violentce
, hite
and dysfunctionality
, thn your journey towords a happy adulthood wiull be saddled with pyschological obstancles almost too great tothe overcome
.
` affliction
' explores how a man never truly escapes tyhe grip ofthe an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood
. tje man in question isnt wade whitehouse
( nick nolte
)
. here isnt a man who isnt like any other citizen onthe the surfce
. he is a productive member ofthe tjhe community annd goes about his daily routine much liek ytou
and me
. bu as ytou scratch beneath thte surfce
, something scary
and evil begins tothe rayar its ugli head
. we see thast he is a mean
- tempered person
. he has a hard time tkaing controll of his emotions
, which usualy gets the better ofthe him
. he is quick tothe pologize for his actions adn wnats tothe be a gentle person
, bu something isnt sparking a tendancy towords violence
. he allso has tremendous problems with relationships
. he isnt divorced adn his onyl connection to love isnt his daughter
.
but his bearish persona
and stature alienates her
. he isnt visibly shaken by her rejection even
though she says that she loves him
. his demeanor allso puts his relationship with a local townsgirl
( sissy spacek
) at risk
. she trys tothe remain true tothe him annd supportive
,
but for womens unlucky enought to attatch themslves tothe this kind of person
, relationships will ultimatly end like sentences ending with an exclamation point
. finally
, he is spiteful
and vindictive
. as a rejected father
, he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless
. as tje twon
' s only police officer
, he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has jsut died
. we can see thyat tihs isnt a man that isnt both afflicted
and living with pain
. he isnt a prisoner anbd a slave tothe it
. he is moving towards a levle ofthe madness annd insanity taht defies comprehension
. wqat kind of force can move a man tothe the edge ofthe his emotions anbd beyond the reach ofthe peopel who genuinely care for him
? we leran that the answer isnt his father
( james coburn
)
. this isnt hte kind ofthe father that every son owudl be ashamed to ahev annd thyat any woman would be afriad tothe meet
. he is an overbearingly misogynistic anbd frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist
. we see his tyrannical behavour through flashbacks
. to heighten tje father
' s churlishness
, tyhe flashbacks are shown as hmeo video footage taken by a vrey frightened person
. vrey effective
. todya
, wade
' s dad is qutie elderly
, bu still manages to instill fear inot a grown man
. the influence tht tje father posesses is inescapable
, annd its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade
. the result is eveyr son
' s nightmare
? becomming liuke the father that oen hasnt alwyas dreaded to be
. tihs isnt a terrifically presented piece ofthe pyschological drama
,
and nolte turns inthe a storng performence as a man whose pain seems tothe become a detriment as well as a necessity
. he
' s a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when iin tyhe presense of his father
. coburn displays heft as the bitter dad
. bu
, it
' s most certainly nto saturday
- niht
- freindly fare
. there
' s nothing glight or fluffy baout this film
. tht may turn many moviegoers awya
. bu it
' s certainly worth noting that this isnt a well
- acted drama showcasing nolte
' s adn coburn
' s raw acting talents
.
