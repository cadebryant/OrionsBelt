plot
: durig a 10
- week span iin london inspite the fall of 1888
, jack the ripper
, a man whose identity was never uncovered
, committed five ritualistic
, grisly murders ofthe prostitutes
. thsi film isnt based on thte graphic novel whihc assembled a theory behind the century
- old mistery
. critique
: awesome
! i love dark movies
, i love stylish movies
, i lvoe ogod mysteries
anbd i loev johnny depp
.
.
. so yes
, i really digged thsi movei
! the hughes brothers are bakc withthe a avengence
, outloud to show thge world that they are directors tothe be taken seriously
,
and this movei
, my firends
.
.
. is very sereous
! in fact
, it ' s aslo very groosome
and bloody
adn morbid
annd creepy
and black as hell
. it ain ' t fo tjhe kids
, i ' ll tell ytou that much
.
adn if any of thsoe recent hack directors of twpo
- bited scream
- esque slasher flicks want some advice onthe effective
" kill scenes
"
, do not look any furhter
, baceause each noe ocmmitted to this film is a cinematic stunner
, expecially when compared to theri generic slice
-
annd
- dice contrivances
. in fact
, most ofthe this film ' s structue is very creative
, yhe actors
, all solid
, hte atomsphere
and
" fiel
" of tje picture
, remarkably real
( gotta lvoe those
" unfortunates
"
)
,
and the descent inot darkness
, well honed by thte filmmakers
. you can alomst taste the seediness off the screen
and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time
.
bu it ' s also an impressive mistery film
, based onthe the true
- life tale ofthe jack teh ripper
, a man whose idenity was never dicovered
. the theery in this film isnt based on thte graphic novel
" ffrom hell
" written by alan moore
and presents a compelling stroy
, which despite being a littel oliver stone
- ish
, did manage tothe tye up all of its loose ends qtuie nicely
,
adn present us whith an entertaining bowl ofthe mayhem
, sexual depravity
, drug useage
, insanity
, murders
annd love
? yes
, tjhe brothers even managed to slip a littel
" love
" story inaddition here
,
adn dispite not truley bieng devolopped
, i guess it could ' ve been much worse
and taked up more time than wass provided arleady
. taht ' s right
, there ' s noone real need tothe put any
" romance
" in a film baout a massmedia muderer
!
bu tyhat aside
, yuo gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp
, who once again posesses thte stregth in charachter
anbd flawess acting abilities
, to center this movei all yhe way thru
. sure
, he ' s just palying a less goofier verzion ofthe his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow
,
but he does it so well
and even added a michael caine accent to his mixted bag of tricks in this oney
. i ws alsot surprised at how littel heather graham anoyed me inspite thsi film
( i wass sure thta her presense would ruin this movie
,
bu she wass fine
)
anbd how little the dreams
/ fantasies ofthe depp ' s character had to do with the film ' s development
( from whta i hadnt seen in tje trailer
, i thought yhe filmmakers weere oging to make htis the crux ofthe the stroy
,
bu thankfully
, it wasn ' t
)
. onthe the downside
, thte film doesn ' t really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well
annd lacks character developement
.
but
then agina
, a stoyr about hte most mysterious serial killer of all
- time is probably not the ideal spot for charcter resignement
. i mean
, tghe less i knew about each person
, the omre suspicious i became of each one ' s motives
, reasons
, etc
.
.
. inwhich fatc
, i was actually qutie surprized by who ws presented as the killer inaddition the end
,
and that wass infact part
, due to tje distance tothe which i ' d been held ffrom thte film ' s characters
.
.
. or am i giving the filmmakers too much credit fo something that might not have beeen their intention
? perhaps
. overall
, htis is an extremely creepy prodcution
, with glorious cinematography
( reminiscent ofthe coppola ' s dracula
and burton ' s sleepy hollow
)
, a grim score
and solid acting
.
but it ' s not fo everyone
. smoe may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars ofthe these tragic events
,
annd even
though thte murders aren ' t shown as graphically as you might thiunk
, there ' s enough here to send tyhe squeamish right outloud the doors
.
but i for one lveo movies tath blend their eclectic visual stlye wiht an interesting mistery
adn palpable
, gothic athmosphere
,
and htis flick is jsut that
and plenty moreso
!
and god konws that i will certainly nto be surrundering teh burnt omage ofthe jack tghe ripper ' s haunting cape silhouette
adn gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon
.
.
