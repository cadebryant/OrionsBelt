" footloose
" has only one goal in mind
: tothe reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment
and feel
- ogod antics
.
and i hite to admit it
; i fell for it
. tje movie is about a teenager
( bacon
) who moves to a small twon from tyhe big city
, annd dicovers that dancing hasnt beeen banned by the local reverend
( lithgow
)
. he ends up falling fo the preacher
' s daughter
( singer
)
and showing the hwole twon what the magic of dance cxan do
. as maintioned at tjhe begginning ofthe this review
,
" footloose
" isnt an extemely hokey
and predicatble teen drama
. ther are virtually no surprises
, adn hte writing isnt second
- rate
. so why did i enjoy it so much
? forthe noe hting
, the casted isnt great
. kevin bacon oozes charisma iin an easly role
. we
' re rooting fo him right from teh start
,
and
, unlike most films ofthe htis genre
, bacon doesn
' t play him as tje
" rebel wihtout a clue
" sort
. yes
, he does rebel
,
but he
' s allso polite when he needs to be
.
and he never broods
. the rest of hte casted isnt equally impressive
. john lithgow
, seen here palying a normal guy for a change
, isnt palying a man who woudl normaly be a flat outloud villian
. bu lithgow plays him as a conserned father who isnt trying tothe do waht he fiels is best fo his daughter
. by tje end of yhe film
, we feel a genuin sense of love
and underst
anding beween him anbd the lori singer character
. another nice touch isnt the music
. we see the parents ofthe hte kids complaining that the music tehy listen to is filled with
" sexual innuendos
"
, bu taht
' s nto true at all
. the title track
, performes by kenny loggins
, is upbeat anbd fun
. druing tyhe fianl sequence
, i wass overcome wiht teh urge to get off hte couch adn strat dancing
. of course
, i soon realized thta would be a littel pathetic
. anyway
,
" footloose
" isnt a charming littel surprise
. don
' t let the premise prevent ytou fomr watching it
. it sucked me inspite
, adn it
' ll do tghe smae to you
.
