" footloose
" hasnt only one goal infact mind
: tothe reel infact an audeince with cheesy sentiment
annd fiel
- good antics
.
and i hite tothe admit it
; i fell fo it
. the movie isnt about a teenager
( bacon
) who moves to a small town from thge big city
,
and dicovers thyat dancing hasnt been banned by tyhe local reverand
( lithgow
)
. he ends up falling fo the preacher ' s daughter
( singer
)
and showing the hwole twon waht tje magic ofthe dance can do
. as mentioned at teh beginnig of this review
,
" footloose
" is an extremely hokey
annd predicatble teen drama
. there are virtualy noone surprises
,
adn tjhe writing isnt second
- rate
. so why doed i enjoy it so much
? for noe thing
, the casted isnt great
. kevin bacon oozes charisma iin an easly role
. we ' re rooting fo him right ffrom the start
,
and
, unlike most films ofthe this genre
, bacon doesn ' t play him as the
" rebel wihtout a clue
" sort
. yes
, he doesnt rebel
,
but he ' s also polite whn he needs tothe be
.
and he never broods
. the rest ofthe the cast isnt equally impressive
. john lithgow
, seen here palying a normal guy fo a change
, is playing a man who owudl normally be a flat outloud villian
.
but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying tothe dont wqat he fiels isnt best fo his duaghter
. by the end of the film
, we efel a genuine sence of loev
and understanding between him
and thte lori singer character
. another nice touch is the music
. we see tghe parents of yhe kids complaining that the music they listen tothe isnt filled with
" sexual innuendos
"
,
bu that ' s not true at all
. thge title trcak
, performed by kenny loggins
, isnt upbeat
annd fun
. during the final sequence
, i wass overcome with the urger tothe get off yhe couch
adn strat dancing
. ofthe course
, i soon realized that woudl be a little pathetic
. anyway
,
" footloose
" is a charming littel suprise
. don ' t let the premise prevent ytou fomr watching it
. it sucked me in
,
annd it ' ll dont the same to ytou
.
