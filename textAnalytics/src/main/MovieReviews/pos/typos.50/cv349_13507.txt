martin scorsese
' s kundun
, which chronicles roughly the frist twenty yeasr of teh life ofthe hte currenly exliled dalai lama
, has been criticized fo its lack of narrative structure
. personaly
, i don
' t think it needs one
: it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddist culture adn how communist china
. scorsese views the dalai lama tjhe way many tibetans probaly do
, as a larger
- than
- life symbol ofthe buddist spirituality annd polliticel leadership
: the onyl glimpses into his head cmo fomr severeal interesting
yet oblique dream sequences
, bu his portrayal isnt appropriate fo a film taht consentrates on tghe polliticel
and spritual rether than yhe personel
. yhe setted design anbd cinematography are oust
anding
, anbd hwile scorsese occasionally seems tothe git carried away with hte spectacle
, it helps to augment yhe cultural contrast whn the dalai lama travels tothe china tothe meet chairman mao
. poltical art sometimes succumbs tothe tje temptation to start shouting slogans
, kundun does not
: it succeeds inthe delivering its message inthe an artistically interesting way
and without being overly manipulative
.
