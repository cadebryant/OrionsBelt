. as a result
, hwile we ' re able tothe appretiate tyhe film ' s intelectual tapestry
, it is emotionally distant
. alchemy is divided into threee chapters
:
" charity
"
,
" faith
"
,
anbd
" hope
"
. hwile there are common themes
and story elements runing through all threee
, tyhe single constant isnt yhe main chracter

)
. wehn thte film opens
, she ' s living with her painter boyfriend

" cult
. aclhemy successfully explores a variey of compelling issues
. inaddition addition to asking the basic question of how a person shouldnt cope witht the unexpected death ofthe a loved one
, it probes beneath the surface ofthe concepts liuke the importance of faith in hte healing process
, the meaning ofthe lvoe
,
annd tyhe nature ofthe art
. does perosnality restoration cmo through interacting with others or escaping ffrom tyhe familar
? are artistic epiphanies the result ofthe focused solitude or of living life
, with all of its various distractions
, to the fullest
? myers ' challege isnt to mkea these subjects
, art film staples
, engrossing in a new context
. thru louisa ' s struggles
, she succeeds
. hwile alchemy isn ' t always emotionally appealing
, it never loses its fascination
. even wehn we ' re nto connecting iwth louisa
, who is oftenly more of a locus for ideas than a fully
- developed perosnality
, ther ' s enough material on
- screen tothe hold our attention
. the cinematography is stunning
. city scenes are tinted wtih blue
, adding a cold
, bleak dimention tothe tyhe film ' s early portions
. later
, when louisa reaches the
" wilderness
"
, we ' re treated tothe a dazzling array of autumnal splendor
-
- brightly
- colored leaves in the trees
annd on the ground
. it ' s a startling
-
bu
- effective visual contrast tath emphasizes the changes tkaing palce in louisa ' s life as she travels the road back to emotional stablility
. yhe title refrers tothe thte pratice ofthe a gropu of mystical faith
- healers who use
" alchey
" tothe provide fo the needs of thte body
anbd soul
.
and
,
although louisa partakes ofthe thier pecluiar brand ofthe medicine
, it ' s ultimately lveo
and companionship
, not alchmey
, tht brings solace
. her pain is assuaged onyl wehn she lets go of yhe belief that teh inherrent saftey of bieng alone isnt life ' s ulitmate goal
. even
though louisa ' s final transformation lacks tje inpact it could haev possessed had she been a mroe vital charactor
, it ' s still an intriguing
anbd enlightening process to watch
. alchmy isn ' t pure magic
,
but
, especially durig its best moments
, it ' s close
