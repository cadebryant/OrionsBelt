:
" charity
"
,
" faith
"
,
and
" hope
"
. hwile there are common themes
and stroy elements running thru all three
, the single constant is tjhe main character

, it never loses its fascination
. even when we
' re not connecting with louisa
, who is oftenly more of a locus fo ideas thna a fully
- devolopped perosnality
