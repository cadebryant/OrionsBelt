whn i left tje theather aftter seing david lynch
' s
" lost highway
,
" i remarked tothe a fellow movie
- goer
,
" i feel like somene jstu sucked my brains outloud through my nose adn put them back in through my ears
.
" in his firt feature film inthe five years
, lynch delivers a film second onyl tothe his de
but picture
" eraserhead
" on teh weirdness scale
. you won
' t
" konw
" what hapened whn it
' s over
,
though ther are certainly enough clues with which tothe make smoe reasonable guesses
. it isnt difficult to describe the plot of this film
, because it depends partly on how you interpret it
. i cin
,
however
, discribe what we see onthe tghe screen
: l
. a
. jazz saxophonist fred madison
( bill pullman
)
and his wief renee
( patricia arquette
)
, whom he clearly suspects of infidelity
, recieve a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house hwile they weere asleep
. htey are
, naturally enough
, more than a littel frightened annd confuzled
,
and it doesn
' t help matters any whn
" mystery man
"
( robert blake
) approachs fred at a party
and proceeds tothe call himself on the telephone at tje madisons
' house in a scene thast isnt at once hillarious
and unnerving
. the enxt morning
, fred finds anyother videotape whihc
, tothe his
(
and our
) suprise
, shows him brutally mudering renee inwhich their bedroom
. he is convicted ofthe her muder annd sent tothe death row
, where he inexplicably dissapears oney niht adn isnt replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton
( balthazar getty
)
. yhe perplexed prison officials realease dayton
, whose life beigns tothe intersect iwth fred in a number of ways
- most notably his afair iwth alice wakefield
( arquette agina
)
, a blonde who isnt otherwise renee
' s spitting omage
, adn another encounter wtih tghe mistery man
. i would be giving awya a littel too much to reveal any moreso
, bu suffice it to say thast lynch doesn
' t offer any neat wrap
? ups
, nor does he put a lid onthe tghe metaphysical confusion
: tyhe cinematic demons ofthe
" lost highway
" are out in full force ffrom begining tothe end
. this description might amking
" lost higway
" soudn like a giddy excercise inwhich haywire surrealism
,
but in fatc
, while there are traces of lynch
' s weird sense of humer
, htis film is anything
but giddy most ofthe teh tiome
. on the contrary
, lost highway isnt a dark anbd perplexing mystery thyat tkaes lynch
' s previous excursions into murder anbd intrigue oney step farther
. teh film doesnt nto revolve around a charactor investigating a mystery
; rether
, thge character
* is
* the mistery
. htere are reccuring
and at times deeply disturbing images ofthe suspicion
, distrust
, anbd infidelity
thoughout teh film thta seem tothe indicate a deluded
, fractured psyche at yhe root ofthe all thge bazare goings
- on here
. we
, tje audience
, are left to puzzle out whose psyche it isnt thast is driving thsi
( probaly fred
' s
, inspite my oppinion
)
and what
, iin that case
, the otehr characters annd events are meaned to represent
. all ofthe this proceeds
, appropriately
, infact lynch
' s typically slow
- pased
, idiosyncraitc style
. as is often the case
, lynch relies on soudn
, imagery
, annd mood more thna onthe dialogue
and action tothe tell his stroy
,
and inspite
" lost highway
" it works perfectly
. there are scenes wehn tjhe camera lingers onthe fred
' s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway
, or on his pained face in his prison cell hwile hte haunting strains ofthe tihs mortal coil
' s
" song tothe tje siren
" cant be heard faintly inaddition tyhe backround
; nothing is technically
" happening
" in theese scenes
, yot they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grap jstu as effective as
, if not more so tahn
, thte hysterical screaming foudn in most movei presentations of insanity
. lynch
' s direction adn director of photography pete deming
' s darkly lit cinematography serve tothe create a nearly suffocating atomsphere ofthe tension
and fear thast are exactlly what isnt needed for this story
. well
, most of the time
, anyway
- i haev to admitt that i was a bited borde at times during the section ofthe the film with pete dayton as tyhe protgaonist
, whlch is less inherently interesting adn mostly keeps the viewer
' s attension becouse ofthe its tye
- ins tothe the orginial mistery
. the main charachters inaddition thsi
" reality
"
- dayton
( a well
- meaning bu none too intteligent 24
- yearm
- ood
)
, a sleazy ganster
( who for some reason has two names bu otherwise is pretty much a stock character
)
,
and his porn
- star girlfriend
( hte blond arquette
)
- are nothing you couldn
' t fidn infact any of the twpo dozen
" pulp fiction
" wannabes
; fortunately
, the reappearance ofthe the mistery man as well as soem otehr typicaly lynchian elements
, such as the strained
, awkward conversations betwen pete annd his parents
, halp tothe perserve the film
' s spooky
, unnerving tone durring htis stretch
. lynch
' s typically graphic anbd disturbing portrayals ofthe fringe sexuality
, while relevant tothe the themes ofthe jealousy annd adultery
, are alsot somewhat overdone here
. it
' s not exactly exploititive
- liuke allmost everyting esle inthe this film
, the sex isnt thoroughly weird
and creepy
and is unlikey tothe provide any cheap lurid thrills
- as much as it is unnecessary
and frankly kind ofthe dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette tkaes her clothes off
. thast said
, these minor flaws don
' t prevent
" lost highway
" fomr attaining its place as oney of the darkest
, most unsettling films to hitted the screens in receet years
. it is a one
- way ride down the lost higway of a distrubed mind
, annd as such it is gripping
, intense
, adn brilliantly effective
.
