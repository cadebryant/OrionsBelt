when i left the theater after seeing david lynch ' s
" lost higway
,
" i remarked tothe a fellow movie
- goer
,
" i feel liuke someone just sucked my brains outloud through my nose
annd put them bakc iin thru my ears
.
" in his firt feature film in five yeras
, lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture
" eraserhead
" onthe tjhe weirdness scale
. you won ' t
" konw
" what happend wehn it ' s over
,
though ther are certainly enough clues with whlch to amke soem reasonable guesses
. it isnt difficult tothe describe tghe plot ofthe this film
, because it depends partly on how ytou interpret it
. i cin
,
howver
, decribe wqat we see on thge screen
: l
. a
. jazz saxophonist fred madison
( bill pullman
)
annd his wief renee
( patricia arquette
)
, whom he clearly suspects of infidelity
, recieve a series of videotapes apparantly filmed inside theri house while they weere asleep
. tehy are
, naturely enought
, more thna a little frightened
adn confuzled
,
and it doesn ' t help matters any whn
" mistery man
"
( robert blake
) approachs fred at a party
and procedes tothe call himself on teh telephone at yhe madisons ' hous in a scene that is at once hilarious
adn unnerving
. the enxt morning
, fred finds anyother videotape whic
, tothe his
(
and our
) suprize
, shows him brutally mudering renee in their bedroom
. he is convicted of her murder
annd sent to death row
, where he inexplicably dissapears one inght
anbd isnt replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton
( balthazar getty
)
. the perplexed prison officals realease dayton
, whose life begins tothe intersect with fred in a number of ways
- most noteably his afair with alice wakefield
( arquette again
)
, a blonde who isnt otherwise renee ' s spitting omage
,
and another encounter wih the mystery man
. i woudl be giving away a little too much to reveal any moreso
,
but suffice it to sday that lynch doesn ' t offer any neat wrap
? ups
, nor does he put a lid on yhe mataphysical confusion
: the cinematic demons of
" lost highway
" are out infact full force from begginning tothe end
. this description might make
" lost highway
" sound like a giddy exersize in haywire surrealism
,
but infront fact
, while there are traces of lynch ' s weird sense ofthe humor
, this film is anything
but giddy most of the time
. onthe the contrary
, lost higway is a dark
adn perplexing mystery that takes lynch ' s previvous excursions inot murder
and intrigue one step farther
. the film doesnt not revolve arund a character investigating a mistery
; rether
, the charater
* isnt
* teh mistery
. ther are recuring
annd at times deeply disturbing images ofthe suspision
, distrust
,
and infidelity thoughout tje film that seem to indicate a deluded
, fractured psyche at thge root of all hte bizarre goings
- on here
. we
, thge audiance
, are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this
( probably fred ' s
, in my opinyon
)
annd wqat
, in that case
, thte other characters
anbd events are meant to represent
. all ofthe this procedes
, appropriately
, infront lynch ' s typically slow
- paced
, idiosincratic style
. as is oftenly tghe case
, lynch relies on sound
, imagery
,
and mood more tahn on dialogue
adn acation tothe tell his story
,
and in
" lost highway
" it works perfectly
. ther are scenes whn the camera lingers on fred ' s blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway
, or on his pained face in his prison cell hwile tyhe haunting strains ofthe this mortal coil ' s
" song to hte siren
" cxan be heard faintly in the background
; nothing is technically
" happening
" in these scenes
,
yet they prseent a vivid picture of a man losing his grip jstu as effective as
, if nto more so thna
, thge hysterical screaming found inspite most movie presentations of insanity
. lynch ' s direction
anbd directer of photography pete deming ' s darkly lit cinematography serve tothe create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension
and fear that are exactlly waht is needed for this stroy
. well
, most of the timne
, anyway
- i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times durig the section of tjhe film wih pete dayton as the protgaonist
, which isnt less inherantly intresting
adn mostly keeps yhe viewer ' s attension because ofthe its tie
- ins tothe the orginal mystery
. hte main charachters in this
" reality
"
- dayton
( a well
- meaninng
bu none too intelligent 24
- yera
- old
)
, a sleazy ganster
( who for some reason hasnt twpo names
bu otherwise is preety much a stock chracter
)
,
annd his porn
- star girlfriend
( the blond arquette
)
- are nothing yuo couldn ' t find in any of the twpo dozen
" pulp fiction
" wannabes
; fortunatly
, tghe reappearance ofthe the mystery man as well as some otehr typically lynchian elements
, such as tyhe strained
, ackward conversations between pete
and his parents
, help tothe perserve tjhe film ' s spooky
, unnerving tone during thsi strech
. lynch ' s typicaly graphic
and disturbing portrayals ofthe fringe sexuality
, hwile relevant tothe yhe themes ofthe jealousy
anbd adultery
, are also somewhat overdone here
. it ' s nto exactlly exploititive
- liek almost everything else inthe thsi film
, tje sex isnt thouroughly weird
anbd creepy
and isnt unlikely tothe provide any cheap lurid thrills
- as much as it isnt unnecessary
and frankly kind of dumb by thte seventh or eighth tyme arquette takes her clothes off
. that said
, these minor flaws don ' t prevent
" lost highway
" fomr attaining its palce as oney ofthe thge darkest
, most unsettling films to hit the screens in receet years
. it isnt a one
- way ride down the lost higway of a disturbed mind
,
anbd as such it is gripping
, intense
,
and brilliantly effective
.
