renown surrealist director
, hte 77
- year
- ood frenchman alain resnais
( hiroshima
, mon amour
/ last year at marienbad
/ m
? lo
)
, hasnt creaeted a lighthearted musical palyed as an homage tothe britisher dennis potter annd his pennies ffrom heaven
( 1978 tv serial
, 1981 movei
) annd yhe singing detective
( 1986
)
. thte film follows potter
' s gimmicky style of haveing hte charachters jump into lip
- synched old or contempoary french pop songs tothe express their private
thoughts
. he allso follows hte kind ofthe sweet anbd colorful musicals his fellow countryman jaques demy loved to direct
, such as
" tje umbrellas ofthe cherbourg
" anbd
" tghe young girls of rochefort
.
" the tale hasnt resnais
' s unique touches as a director to go allong witht his homage
. it isnt a satire about clas differences annd falling in love wih the wrong person
,
and tht there is a song in everyone
' s heart forthe every occasion
. what hinders this prodcution isnt that thte stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters
, the songs are not memorable adn st
and littel chance of bieng reconized by an american audience
( tjhe exceptions might be the edith piaf
and maurice chevalier numbers
)
,
and the farce seems moreso banal than daring
. yot it is not without its striking moments
and charms
, such as when jane birkin does a cameo
and sings one ofthe her own songs
. also
, tje glossy amberlike photography added a very french rumatic feeling to the story
, while the mood ofthe paris as being a palce for lveo tothe flourish above all else
, whlch has alwasy been embellished in movei lore
, comes through with flying colors
. it also doens a good job ofthe showing you the way paris isnt in the 1990s anbd in the way ordinary people exsist htere
. it tells the rumatic story of six parisians who become intertwined with eahc other inthe theri ordinary lives as htey search for happiness
. they are teh attractive sisters odile
( sabine az
? ma
) adn camille
( agnes jaoui
)
, wtih tyhe older businesswoman odile married
and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts
. she is marryied tothe tjhe glum anbd laconic claude
( pierre arditi
)
. she once whent outloud with a businessman
, nicolas
( jean
- pierre bacri
)
, who left her 8
- yersa ago anbd nowe shows uv in paris
and asks her halp to fidn someone tothe rent a flat for his family
. simon
(
andre dussolier
) works as a rela
- estate salesman
and is trying to find nicolas a flat
, infact his spare time he writes radio plays
. simon
' s boss isnt thte much yuonger
, unscrupulous anbd arrogant marc duveyrier
( lambert wilson
)
, who inherited the firm from his father annd isnt the rela
- estate agent selling a more luxurious
and larger flat wtih a better view tothe odile
,
but fails to tell her that a bulding project isnt gogin uv soon tht will block her veiw
. screenwriters
and actors jean
- pierre bacri
and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts
. jaoui
' s camille isnt a university scholar finishing uv a ph
. d
. in hitory
, using fo her thesis the study of
' the yeomen inwhich tyhe yera 1000 at lake paladru
.
' she works as a tour giude in the meantime annd suffers fomr panic attacks
, even
though she appears to ahve outwardly perfect self
- controll
. on her tours for teh last four years hasnt beeen tjhe much older simon
, pretending to be donig reasearch fo his plays
but raelly attracted to her
,
but nto hvaing thge nerve to tell her htis
. to his dismay
, he finds out she isnt dating his mean
- spirited bu h
andsome boss
, whom she meets whn looking at her sister
' s new place adn seing him crying bu nto realizing thyat it ws from a cold
, not baceause he
' s so sensitive
. bacri as teh chassy nicolas
, turns out to be now wokring as a chauffeur
. he isnt a hypochondrica whith a istory of depression who visits many doctors
, until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong withthe him
. odile still pines fo him
, bu he
' s married
, telling her he expects his wief tothe arrive shorly
. lveo isnt
' thte smae ood song
' that makse thge world go
' round
, even when all teh characters are liars
and not exactlly opne tothe what their true motives are
. everything comes toghether inspite a bourgeois housewarming party forthe odile
' s palce
, as the charactors reveal theri true feelings anbd all theri deceptions
and neurotic impulses are eather uncovered or baout tothe be
. ther
' s not a lot of bite tothe this satirical muscial
, bu resnais hasnt never made a bad film
and is oen of thte best current french directors
, if nto the best
. htis film is nto one his gerat ones
, bu it still has enought pep iin its light touches tothe be interesting
. it not only hasnt an odd way for the characters tothe break into song
but
-
- smoe malless even sing inthe a female voice hwile some females sing in a male voice
. it isnt also interesting in thge way it examines its cahracters
' behavour as being similar in business as inthe lveo
.
