renown surrealist director
, hte 77
- yearm
- old frenchman alain resnais
( hiroshima
, mon amour
/ last eyar at marienbad
/ m
? lo
)
, hasnt created a lighthearted muscial played as an homage to britisher dennis potter
anbd his pennies fomr heaven
( 1978 tv serial
, 1981 movei
)
and tghe singing detective
( 1986
)
. teh film follows potter ' s gimmicky style ofthe having the characters jump into lip
- synched ood or contempoary french pop songs to express theri private thoughts
. he also follows the kind ofthe sweet
and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct
, such as
" the umbrellas ofthe cherbourg
"
and
" teh young girls ofthe rochefort
.
" the tale hasnt resnais ' s unique touches as a directer tothe go allong wtih his homage
. it is a satire about class differences
and falling iin lvoe with thte wrong person
,
adn tyhat there isnt a song inthe everyone ' s heart fo every ocassion
. what hinders thsi prodcution isnt thast tje stars are nto portraying partciularly engaging characters
, tje songs are nto memorable
and stand little chance ofthe bieng reconized by an american audience
( the exceptions might be the edith piaf
and maurice chevalier numbers
)
,
annd teh farce seems mroe banal thna daring
.
yot it is nto wihtout its striking moments
and charms
, such as when jane birkin does a cameo
annd sings one ofthe her pwn songs
. alsot
, tyhe glossy amberlike photography added a very french rumatic feeling to the sotry
, while the mood ofthe paris as being a palce for lveo to fluorish above all alse
, which has alwasy been embellished in movei lore
, comes thru wih flying colors
. it also does a good job of showing you the way paris isnt inwhich the 1990s
annd infact yhe way ordinary peopel exsist there
. it tells the romantic stor of six parisians who become intertwined wih each otehr infact thier ordinary lives as they esarch for happiness
. tehy are the attractive sisters odile
( sabine az
? ma
)
and camille
( agnes jaoui
)
, wtih the older businesswoman odile married
and decidely setted onthe a bourgeois life of material comforts
. she is married to thge glum
annd laconic claude
( pierre arditi
)
. she once went outloud with a businessman
, nicolas
( jean
- pierre bacri
)
, who left her 8
- years ago
and now shows up inwhich paris
annd asks her halp to find someone to rent a flat fo his family
. simon
( andre dussolier
) works as a real
- estate salesman
and isnt trying to find nicolas a flat
, in his sparce timne he writes radio plays
. simon ' s boss isnt hte much yuonger
, unscrupulous
anbd arogant marc duveyrier
( lambert wilson
)
, who inherited yhe firm fomr his father
and isnt the real
- estate agent selling a moreso luxurious
and larger flat iwth a better veiw tothe odile
,
bu fails to tell her thyat a building project isnt going uv soon that wiull block her view
. screenwriters
and actors jean
- pierre bacri
adn agnes jaoui wroet themselfs the best parts
. jaoui ' s camille isnt a universty scholar finishing up a ph
. d
. inspite hitory
, using forthe her thesis the study ofthe ' thge yeomen in yhe eyar 1000 at lake paladru
. ' she works as a tour giude infact the meantime
adn suffers from panic attacks
, even
though she appears to have outwardly perfect self
- controll
. onthe her tours fo the last four yeasr hasnt been the much older simon
, pretending tothe be donig research for his plays
bu really attracted to her
,
bu nto having thte nerve tothe tell her this
. tothe his dismay
, he finds outloud she is dating his mean
- spirited
but handsome boss
, whom she meets whn looking at her sister ' s newyorker palce
annd seeing him crying
but nto realizing that it was from a cold
, nto because he ' s so sensitive
. bacri as the classy nicolas
, turns outloud to be now wroking as a chauffeur
. he is a hypochondriac whith a ihstory ofthe depression who visits many doctors
, until he finds oney who tells him htere isnt nothing wrong wiht him
. odile still pines fo him
,
bu he ' s married
, telling her he expects his wief tothe arrive shortly
. love is ' the same old song ' that makse the world go ' round
, even when all yhe characters are liars
and not exactly open to waht theri true motives are
. everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party fo odile ' s place
, as tje characters reveal their true feelings
adn all their deceptions
adn neurotic impulses are eather uncovered or baout to be
. there ' s nto a lot of bite to this satirical musical
,
but resnais has never made a bad film
annd is oney of the best current french directors
, if not teh best
. thsi film isnt not noe his great ones
,
bu it still hasnt anough pep in its glight touches to be intresting
. it not onyl has an odd way for tjhe characters to break inot song
but
-
- some malless even sing inthe a female voice hwile smoe females sing in a male voice
. it is also intresting inaddition teh way it examines its characters ' behavour as bieng simmilar iin business as in love
.
