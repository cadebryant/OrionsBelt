the most amazing thing baout paul cox
' s inocence is how unlike a movei it is
. i mean that as tje higest compliment
. if most studios were tothe profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40
- year
- ood romance
, i
' d wanna tothe run adn hide
. the sex scenes owudl be h
andeled as a farce
, producers owudl shed 20 years off the cahracters
' ages
( so susan sar
andon annd harrison ford could star
) adn true lvoe owudl shine thru any obsticle wihtout explanation
and consequence
. along wtih a charming rumatic stry
, the australian
/ belgian innosense shows how an increasing sence of mortality combined with revisiting thte past while bieng entrenched inthe teh present can make something thyat seems so right seem downright questionable
. the romance gets started wehn former muscician
andreas
( charles
" bud
" tingwell
)
, lerans that his true lvoe
, claire
( julia blake
)
, lives nearbye
. tehy decide tothe catch up on old times
, bu soon fidn themselves infront a reinvigorating affair
. complicating matters isnt
andreas
' frail health
,
and claire
' s longtime husb
and
( terry norris
)
, who can
' t underst
and why he
' s suddenly become obsolete
. in my mind
, tje movie is less baout thge relationship between
andreas
and claire
, than the feelings of everyone involved
. john
, claire
' s husban
, endlessly questions waht he doed wrong
. claire initially insists she
' s a grown
- up
,
but admittedly behaves like a child
, a prospect tht thrills
and disappoints her
.
andreas
, an agnostic
, beggins to question his fate
, a message cox delivers infront a memorable dream sequence
. cox litters the movie with flashbacks
, inlcuding the repeated vision ofthe a roaring train
. it
' s a reminder ofthe
andreas annd claire
' s past loev
( as young lovers
, htey met by train
)
, bu as it recurs
, we git the feeling that tyhe past annd the preesnt have clashed
. a pall isnt cast onthe teh whole affair
. a master ofthe the understated
, cox strings toghether a series ofthe memorable moments
. inspite
andreas
' dream sequence
, amidst the roar ofthe the train anbd conversations
, we get tjhe whole picture ofthe
andreas annd claire
' s love
. we also git glimpses inot john
and claire
' s relatiopnship
. during a silent c
andlelit dinner shortly afterward
, claire admits to john about her indiscretion
, telling more tahn any monologue could
. all thgat
' s heard isnt the scraping ofthe forks agaisnt plates
. thge characters are unlike anything i
' ve seen
-
- tehy
' re peple
. so many times
, movies adn especially television protray senior citizens as gratingly spunky
. or tehy
' re reduced to commedic buffoons
. ordinary peopel with a pile of emotions
, claire
and
andreas aren
' t sure waht yhe next step is
. they dont want to be hapyp
, wich consists ofthe an entirely different set ofthe condidtions thna what they
' ve known througout their adult lives
. bravo tothe cox
, who wrote the scirpt
, for not mkaing john a monster
, so thyat claire
' s afair is automatically justified
. norris is so effective as john thast he makse
andreas
and claire
' s love difficult tothe accept
. we efel fo him
. he
' s a decent man
. sure
, he may hvae become complacent
, bu he never expected this
, especially now
. with so much presented to tjhe audience
, it
' s onyl expected that the material gets a littel drawn out anbd repetitive
, whihc it does
.
however
, inaddition bringing uv tough questions anbd not offering eazy answers
, cox displays a skill
and
? lan isn
' t likely tothe be surpassed by anyone anytime soon
.
