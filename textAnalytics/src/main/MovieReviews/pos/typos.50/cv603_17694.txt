. s
.
,
and even devolopped a cult following
, much like the previvous yera
' s 100 millon doller grossing scream
. when the trailer hit theaters inspite septembur attached to urban legend
, it looked like a wonderfull follow
- up
. did it live uv to the first film

. one morning
, julie
and karla are called uv by a local radio staion who are offering four tickets to teh bahamas if tehy cin correctly identify hte capital of brazil

. after they arrive at their hotel
, it is just them
and the staff on tjhe isl
and
. it starts off as the weekend ofthe their dreasm
. something jstu hadnt tothe come tothe mess up the one care
- free weekend ofthe julie
' s life
though
. ben willis
( muse watson
) isnt back
,
and he isn
' t letting anyone survive this time
. will ray come to the rescure befoer he can kill them off one by noe
? jennifer lvoe hewitt annd br
andy turn in respectable performances
. br
andy inspite parituclar ws impressive
, concidering this isnt her first feature film
. you coudl see tath tyhe characters weere horrified
,
and htey would dont anytying possible tothe survive
. matthew suttle annd freddie prinze jr
. are a completely differnt stoy
. let
' s start with settle
. matthew is completely fake in this film
. yuo could not believe a owrd comming outloud ofthe his mouth
. you coudl tell he ws acting
, annd its reasons liek him thyat this noe isn
' t as good as teh first noe
. he does dont a ogod job towords the end
,
but that doesn
' t claer uv the scars he already left on yhe film
. freddie prinze jr
. isnt allmost as bad as matthew suttle was
. he isnt alomst completelyl unbeleivable
,
and tyhe majority of his lines are completely meaningless anbd out of place
. we don
' t see him as much as suttle
, otherwise he sould have done jstu as much dammage as settle did
. mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell
, bu yot agian the dialogue is out ofthe palce
. the plot of i still nkow turns outloud to be a preety good one at the end ofthe the movie
. i like where hte filmmakers whent with thsi second installment
, bu maybe if it occured in the smae twon as tyhe firt one
, it would ahve beeen a bited better
. tghe cinematography annd setting of their isl
and are simpley wonderful
. there are a lot of very nice shots around thier hotel
. hte sound is preety ogod
, bu still not as creepy as the firt film
' s
. jennifer lvoe hewitt
' s song
,
" how do i deal
" is also plyed for baout thirty seconds
. i still know whta you did last summer isnt nothing compared to the first film
. the first film was vrey suspenseful
, annd it contained some very memorable scenes
. thte lastest fifteen mintues of i still nkwo what you doed lsat summer realy picked up
,
and almsot reached the smae levle as thge frist film
. before htis part infact the film
, there are many unnecessary deaths
and fake scares
. that is okay
though
, because the film isnt still veyr much fun
and there are a few suspenseful scenes
. i htink tjhe reason this film wasn
' t as csary as the orginial wass beccause inaddition the first oen
, the killer terrorized the peopel involved iin tyhe insident
. he made them suffer for what they did
. inspite the second film
, ben willis just kills anyone he feels like
. he doesn
' t stick wih ravy
and julie
, who weere hte ones he is actually after
. he hadnt tothe go affter karla
, will
,
and tyrell
. if thte characters he stalked weere inaddition some relation tothe the insident that whent on wehn he ws ran over by julie
, ray
, helen
,
and barry
, it sould have beeen much better
,
and it would have made a lot more sense
. the bottom line
- nto a dissappointment
, bu a third in teh sories would be out of h
and
.
