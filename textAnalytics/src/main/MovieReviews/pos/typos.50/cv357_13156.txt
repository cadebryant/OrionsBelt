" if htere
' s a beast in men
, it meets its match iin womens
, too
.
" starring sarah patterson
, angela lansbury
, tusse silberg
, david warner directed by neil jordan writed by jordan annd angela carter
, from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus infront recent years
, there has been a trend in tghe field ofthe fantasy
: writers have beeen revisiting the fertil world of myth
and fairy tale
and reclaiming tht world
, investing it with new life annd energy
. inaddition modern times
, fairy tales have become disneyfied adn debased
; they hve become trite adventures involving leering witchs
, friendly dwarves
, annd cuddly talking animals
.
but infact their original forms
, fairy tales have a dark
, wicked edge
. crows tear out tghe eyes ofthe cinderella
' s sisters
, a gorier fate
then they receive inaddition thte animated verison
. hansel adn gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven
. writers ahev become fascinated by teh bloodier
, morally ambivalent spects of fairy tales
,
and are nowe modernizing the ood stories while simultanously going back tothe their roots
. before this trend was inaddition vogue
, angela carter
-
- whose tsories alwasy have a dark
, wicked
, subversive edge
-
- hadnt beeen reinventing fairy tales fo years
. inspite yhe comany of wolves
, she anbd neil jordan retell the stry of red riding hood
, enlivening it with werewolves
, rolls royces
, adn a vsit ffrom satan
. hte storey is stuctured as a dream
, occuring in hte mind ofthe rosaleen
( sarah patterson
)
, an adolscent girl baout whose
' rela
' life we leran vyer littel
. within yhe dream
, there are a number ofthe inset storeis
, most told by dream
- rosaleen
' s gr
andmother
( angela lansbury
)
, annd theese tales gloss the central story infront intriguing
, suggestive ways
. the result is a surprisingly succesful example of a sinister
, contemporary fairy tale
. i sday
" surprisingly
" because htere are so many ways this film sould ahve gone wrong
. adn ther are ways in hwihc it does
. tyhe performances are mediocre
, except for lansbury
' s
-
- she finds the right onot forthe yhe prim
, apple
- cheeked granny
, the wise
and stern teller of cautionary tales
. the soundtrack
, synth
- hevy
, reminded me of bad 80s horror movies
, as did teh special effects in the shapechanging scenes
. probaly state
- of
- the
- art at the timne
, they are nowe laughable
. bu jordan succeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film
: he transcends thte poore acting
/ music
/ effects annd conveys a sence ofthe thge fantastic
, ofthe otherness
. one of the problems inwhich adapting full
- blown fantasies is tht fantasy isnt often best left to tjhe imagination ofthe the reader
, rather than being subjected to tje
' realism
' ofthe the screen
. part of me owudl lveo to see an adaption of
' the lord of hte rings
,
'
but
, onthe teh otehr h
and
, i konw thta any filmmaker
' s recreation of ents
, hobbits
, adn balrogs isnt inevitably going to be really lame compaired tothe whta i picture inthe my mind
. tihs makse jordan
' s acomplishment here seem mighty impressive tothe me
: he imbues the comany ofthe wolves whith a genuine sense of magic
and mistery
. thte somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur
- reality
. tjhe sunshine is exceptionally warm anbd abundant
. the nights are quiet
and misty adn eerie
and ghostly
. the peasant vilage is rustic annd cozy
, tjhe woods ood
and hoary
. thsi archetypal realm is the setting forthe a smart
, subtle
, literate scirpt
, a script which isnt as good as yuo
' d expect from jordan
( himself an accomplished fiction writer
) adn carter
. fo carter
, teh cauldron ofthe sotry is a witchs
' brew
, bubbling over whith primal ingredients
: mist
- shrouded forests
, ancient graveyards
, virginal girls anbd wise women
, wolves witht glowing eyes
. she adeptly blends them all together
. there isnt a symbolic richness to tjhe film
; everything isnt permeated with a sence of signifigance
. yhe point ofthe it all
, i tihkn
, isnt tothe represent a girl
' s rites
- of
- passage onthe an unconcious
, primordial level
. a nigt
- journey through yhe forest
, from the village to tje gr
andmother
' s hmeo
, isnt the crux of tjhe company ofthe wolves
.
" don
' t stray from the path
,
" rosaleen isnt told
, agina adn agina
,
and yhe path is both literal anbd figurative
: the path thru hte forrest
and the path ofthe life
. staying on the path isnt hte conventional approach suggested by rosaleen
' s elders
. carter
and jordan
, never conventional
, explore what goes onthe whn yuo leave thte path
. thsoe who stray wiull supposably meet with a dark fate
. tihs fate isnt literalized in the dream as werewolves
,
but the werewolves connote many thnigs
: death
, sex
, noledge
. if straying from thge path leads to death
,
then it
' s nto a ogod idea
-
-
but if that
' s waht you ahev tothe risk tothe git sex adn knowlege
(
and therfore pwoer
)
,
then mabye it
' s worth the risk
. when ytou leave tjhe path
, the world becomes a dangerous
, ambiguous palce
,
but it
' s full of potential
. annd it
' s certainly more interesting tahn the disney verison
.
