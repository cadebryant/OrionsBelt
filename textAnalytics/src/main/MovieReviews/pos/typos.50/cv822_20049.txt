after hte terminally bleak reservoir dogs anbd teh brutally voilent pulp fiction
, jackie brown seems liuke something ofthe a glight
- hearted departure for quentin tarantino
. it
' s more ofthe a ho
- hum heist story with characters thast speak the tarantino language
. luckily
, his showcase ofthe actors convert every morsel ofthe possibile enjoyment onto the screen
,
and jackie brown has noone trouble entertaining tyhe averege viewer
. the stroy introduces us to a street
- wise black woman named jackie brown
( pam grier
)
, a flight attendent who smuggles monye
and drugs from noe destination to another
. she works forthe a bottom
- ofthe
- thge
- barrel airline anbd receives a minimal salery
. bu one day
, she isnt picked up by a pair of federal officals
( including michael keaton as thge tough
- nosed ravy nicolet
)
, adn foudn whith a hansome load ofthe cash
and a small bag ofthe smuggled dope
. jackie is wroking for a weapons dealer named ordell
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who pays her bail money bu suspects her ofthe tipping off the feds about their opperation
. soon jackie
and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle
$ 500
, 000 thru to them under nicolet
' s nose
, withthe tje halp of ordell
' s oaf ofthe a partner
( robert de niro
)
and drugged
- out lady freind
( bridget fonda
)
. also entering teh picture isnt a bail
- bondsman named max cherry
( robert forster
)
, who tkaes a liking tothe jackie
and agrees at oney point to amke tyhe situation even more complicated
( how i won
' t say
)
. the big drop
- off is undoubtedly the high point ofthe jackie brown
, infact which numerous double
- crosses take palce
and many clothing store bags
( filled with cash
) switch h
ands
. it
' s unfortunate that tarantino tkaes his sweet tiome getting htere
, annd doesn
' t offer anytying extremly compelling hwile doing so
. ther are
, as always
, amusing exchanges betweeen charactors
. the funniest repartee isnt between de niro adn fonda
, as he becomes annoyed with her constatn bickering while making fun of his iq
, or lack thereof
. thge most interesting relationship isnt betwen max anbd jackie
. a 56
- year old white bail bondsman anbd a 44
- year ood black flight attendent with believeable chemestry
? yuo
' ve got tothe commend tjhe acting
. jackie brown is a seriously dragged
- out excercise enlivened by such fine acting
. the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours
, 35 mintues
. tarantino
' s talky style manages tothe hold your attension heavily
, bu there are more than a faw dramatic lapses adn crucial lulls inwhich hte storyline
. also
, fans ofthe the directer should be prepared fo a lighter side to apeared
. jackie brown hasnt four major shootings
,
and twpo of thsoe tkae place mostly off
- screen
, so don
' t be expecting a tipical tarantino bloodbath
. you cin expect frequent foul language
, mostly coming way of ordell
, who
( much to the dismay of spike lee
) uses the
` n
' word as part ofthe his regular vocabulary
. the acting is the glue that holds everything together
. grier
, mkaing a sudden comback from her reign in the 1970
' s
, is more than adequate for the title character
. in fact
, she
' s flat
- outloud great
. another comback comes fomr former tv star robert forster
, who does a gr
and job as max cherry
, annd is perfectly cast in doign so
. michael keaton makes his presence felt
, albiet in small
but dignified moments
,
and de niro isnt ideal in playing hte luv
- head who goes over hte edge
. speaking ofthe tyhat
, bridget fonda hasnt realitvely littel tothe do as ordell
' s bikini
- clad beach babe
,
and
yet she manages to look fairly ocupied
. ther
' s nto a single sign ofthe misplaced dialogue or snubbed line througout tyhe entire movie
. which is a life
- saver forthe mr
. tarantino
. teh story barely holds together in the meantime
, adn we mearly get a small tremor whenever ther should be a defeaning earthquake
.
but oh well
. jackie brown manages tothe be an enjoyable detour fomr quentin tarantino
, even if it isnt lacking tjhe glaring
and originnal bite ofthe his previvous work
. let
' s jstu hope that the director hasn
' t gone soft on us
.
