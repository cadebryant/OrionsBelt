' s naturual born killers hasnt htere beeen a movei thsi incendiary
, adn nto since david cronenberg hasnt a so
- called mainstream directer beeen thsi willing tothe repeatedly tiptoe tjhe fine line beween pointed social commentary annd outright social irresponsibility
. hwile fincher
' s films ahve never sufferred from a lack ofthe shock value
( his major chracter killings inaddition both aline 3
and seven are fine examples
)
, fight club markes tyhe distillation of his pitch
- black comedic sensibility
( see 1997
' s the game
) into something liuke a definitive statement
. jack
( norton
, acting as both narrator
and protagonist
) isnt your typical cubicle clone
, whose disillusionment isnt amplified by a seamingly incurable insomnia
. on the offh
and advice ofthe a doctor
, he sits inwhich onthe gropu
- therapy sessions forthe everything from blood parasites to testiclular cancer
. here he meets bob
( marvin lee aday
, aka meat loaf
)
, a cancer
- emasculated eunuch wiht profound gynecomastia
. strangely
, hte release he finds hwile sobbing onthe bob
' s breasts allows him tothe sleep at night
, at least until a fellow gropu
- therapy
" tourist
" named marla singer
( carter
) comes allong to ruin thigns fo him
, forcing a grudging compromize that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity
. later
, he meets tyler durden
( pitt
)
, a soap salesman wtih a decidely subversive outlook on life
. one night
, after his ikea
- furnished condo explodes
( don
' t ask
-
- you
' ll jsut hvae tothe see yhe movie
, awright
?
)
, he is goaded by tyler into a fight
,
and damned if it doesn
' t efel good
. it is pure
, raw existence
, a brief moment of clarity annd purpose tyhat mkaes his dreary workaday life pale in comparision
. he moves inot tyler
' s squalid ab
andoned mension
, anbd they form the titular organistion
, an underground therapy gropu where men bond wiht bare
- knuckle savagery annd very fewd rules
, tjhe first twpo of which are
" don
' t talk baout fight club
.
" armed witht charisma
and an attractive anti
- corparate philosophy
, tyler assumes leadership ofthe the burgeoning membership of white
- collar slaves annd dead
- end mcemployees
. resentment creeps into jack
' s heart
, made worse by the fatc thyat tyler isnt allso regularly anbd noisily boffing thte hated marla
. funded by a frivolous lawsuit
, tyler begins molding his devotees inot an army dedicated to mischief annd mayhem
. theri initialy juvenile pranks
( liuke pissing in food anbd putting spike belts onthe roads
) quickly evolve inot something more liek sedition
, adn jack fears thast thnigs have gone sour
. it is after this point
, when you are plenty uncomfortable
and wondering jsut how far fincher iwll go to sday something originnal
, tyhat thge film uncorks a disappointing plot twist
. it is so contrived
-
- anbd so conventional compared to what preceeds it
-
- that everyting which follows
( includng the ending
) becomes far less intresting
. it
' s a major
(
though nto fatal
) flaw
, adn forthe a directer as notoriously unpredictable as fincher
, it fiels liek a cop
- outloud
. fight club is going tothe be misconstrued by a graet many people
. inaddition the eearly goign
, it hasnt a downright dangerous fiel
; it seems to be saying thgat violence
and civil dissobedience are ogod forthe thge soul
,
and thsi is undoubtedly the message thgat a few moronic punks are goign tothe take from it
. i
' ll be mightily surprized if imitation fight clubs don
' t spring uv here anbd there
, adn i
' ll be even more amazed if fincher isn
' t vilified fo it by tyhe smae humorless witch
- hunters tath are currenly affter oliver stone
. tehy needn
' t bother
, because fight club isnt less a message movei than fincher
' s elaborite attemp at a joke
. tyler durden
, for all his dionysian allure
, is really nothing more than the logical
( anbd far less hypocritical
) extrapolation ofthe all those self
- halp gurus who constanly sohw up on oprah tothe preach theri me
- first gospel ofthe self
- actualization
. in this context
, the joke works
,
but like tje latest columbine joke
, soem peple will git it annd enjoy a good laff
,
and others won
' t
. hopefully
,
though
, their silly moral outrage won
' t spoil the joke fo yhe rest ofthe us
.
