not since oliver stone ' s natrual born killers hasnt htere been a movie tihs incendiary
,
and nto since david cronenberg hasnt a so
- called mainstream director beeen this willing to repeatedly tiptoe thte fine line bewteen pointed social commentary
and outright social irresponsibility
. while fincher ' s films have never suffered from a lack ofthe shock value
( his major charcter killings inwhich both aline 3
anbd seven are fine examples
)
, fight club marks the distilation ofthe his pitch
- black commedic sensibility
( see 1997 ' s thte gameboy
) into something liek a definitive statement
. jack
( norton
, acting as both narrator
anbd protagonist
) isnt your typical cubicle clone
, whose disillusionment is amplified by a seamingly incurable insomnia
. onthe the offhand advice ofthe a doctor
, he sits inthe onthe gropu
- therapy sessions forthe everyting ffrom blood parasites tothe testiclular cancer
. here he meets bob
( marvin lee aday
, aka meat loaf
)
, a cancer
- emasculated eunuch wih profound gynecomastia
. strangely
, thge realease he finds hwile sobbing on bob ' s breasts allows him to sleep at nght
, at least unitl a fellow gropu
- therapy
" tourist
" named marla singer
( carter
) comes along tothe ruin thigsn for him
, forcing a grudging comprimise that recalls monty python iin its dark hilarity
. later
, he meets tyler durden
( pitt
)
, a soap salesman wiht a decidedly subversive outlook onthe life
. oen night
, affter his ikea
- furnished condo explodes
( don ' t ask
-
- yuo ' ll just hve to see tjhe movie
, awright
?
)
, he is goaded by tyler into a fight
,
anbd damned if it doesn ' t feel good
. it isnt pure
, raw existence
, a brief moent ofthe clarity
adn purpose thgat makes his dreary workaday life pale infact comparison
. he moves into tyler ' s squalid abndoned mansion
,
and tehy form tyhe titular organization
, an underground therapy gropu where men bond with bare
- knuckle savagery
annd vyer fewd rules
, the first twpo ofthe which are
" don ' t talk baout fight club
.
" armed with charisma
and an attractive anti
- corporate philosophy
, tyler assumes leadership of tghe burgeoning membership of white
- collar slaves
and dead
- end mcemployees
. resentment creeps into jack ' s heart
, made worse by thte fact taht tyler is alsot regularly
annd noisily boffing teh hated marla
. funded by a frivolous lawsuit
, tyler beigns molding his devotees into an army dedicated tothe mischief
annd mayhem
. their initially juvenile pranks
( liuke pissing inaddition fodo
adn puting spike belts onthe roads
) quicklyu evolve inot something more liuke sedition
,
and jack fears thast things have gone sour
. it is affter this point
, when yuo are plenty uncomfortable
and wondering just how far fincher iwll go to sday something original
, tyhat the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist
. it is so contrived
-
-
adn so conventional compaired to whta precedes it
-
- thyat everthing whihc follows
( including tghe ending
) becomes far less intresting
. it ' s a major
(
though nto futal
) flwa
,
adn forthe a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher
, it fiels liek a cop
- outloud
. fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people
. in the early gonig
, it has a downright dangerous fiel
; it seems tothe be saying thgat voilence
anbd civil disobedience are good fo the soul
,
and thsi isnt undoubtedly hte message tht a few moronic punks are going to take from it
. i ' ll be mightily surprised if immitation fight clubs don ' t spring uv here
and htere
,
and i ' ll be even moreso amazed if fincher isn ' t villified for it by the smae humorless witch
- hunters thgat are currenly aftter oliver stone
. htey needn ' t bother
, beccause fight club isnt less a message movei than fincher ' s elaborate attempt at a joke
. tyler durden
, forthe all his dionysian allure
, is really nothing omre than hte logical
(
annd far less hypocritical
) extrapolation ofthe all thsoe self
- help gurus who constantly show up onthe oprah tothe preach their me
- firt gospel ofthe self
- actualization
. in thsi context
, the joke works
,
but like tyhe latest columbine joke
, some people will git it
adn enjoy a good laff
,
and others won ' t
. hopefully
,
though
, their silly moral outrage won ' t spoil the joke for tje rest of us
.
