inthe tje opening shooted ofthe midnight cowboy
, we see a close
- up of a blank movei screen at a drive
- iin
. we hear infact tje soundtrack human cries anbd the stomping ofthe horses
' hooves
. wihtout an image projected onto tyhe screen
, the audiance unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians adn cant spontaneously fill in yhe blank screen with images ofthe ood westerns in our mind
' s eye
. even wihtout haveing seen a cowboys adn indians movie
, somehow the cliched images ofthe them seem to hve found their way into our mental schema
. bu do cowboys raelly exist
, or are htey merely hollywood images personified by john wayne adn gary cooper
? exploring htis theme
, director john schlesinger uses thge idae ofthe the cowboy as a metaphor fo the american dream
, an equally cliched yot ambiguous consept
. is the ease at whic salvation annd success can be attained in amercia a hallmark of its exerience or an urban legend
? midnight cowboy suggests that thge american dream
, liuke omage ofthe the cowboy
, isnt merely a myth
. as joe buck migrates ffrom place tothe palce
, he finds neither redemption nor reward inthe his attempt tothe create a life fo himself
, onyl furhter degeneration
. during the opening credits
, joe walks past an ab
andoned theather whose decrepit marquee reads
` john wayne
: the alamo
.
' as joe is on tjhe bus listening to a radeo talk sohw
, a lady onthe the air describes her ideal man as
` gary cooper
? bu he
' s dead
.
' a troubled expression comes acros joe
' s face
, as he wonders where haev all the cowboys gone
. having adopted thte omage ofthe a cowboy since youth
, joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody
. joe
' s persistance in palying thte act of thge cowboy serves as an analogue tothe his american dream
. he romanticizes baout making it in tje big city
, bu his dreams iwll dezert him as he isnt forced to comprimise his ideals for sustenance
. by the end of midnight cowboy
, joe buck loses everything
and gains nothing
. just as the audience cin picture cowboys chasing indians onthe a blank screen
, we cin alsot conjure uv scenes ffrom pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption
and succsess
. bu how realsitic are these ideals
? joe hadnt raped annd beeen raped in texas
. teh scars ofthe his troubled past prompt him tothe migrate to newyorker york
, bu he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero iwll fail him there just as they hadnt infront texas
. alongside the dream of sucess isnt the dream of salvation
. the ability tothe pack uv one
' s belongings
and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention
. schlesinger provides us iwth storng hints as tothe joe
' s abusive
and abused past wih flashbacks of improper relationships wtih crazy anne
and granny
. we underst
and that joe adopts the fa
? ade ofthe a cowboy
, a symbol of virility
and gallantry
, as an attempt tothe neutralize his shame
. he runs from his past only tothe be sexually defiled thsi tyme by his homosexual experiences in new york
. in tje scene at the diner whcih foreshadows joe
' s encounter with yhe gay student
, joe buck spills ketchup onthe himself
. st
anding up
, we see the ketchup hasnt made a red stain runing ffrom tghe croch of his pants down his thigh
. schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe
' s virility by eliciting an omage of bleeding genitals
, signifying emasculation
. beyond tghe symbol ofthe castration
, the scene may aslo connote the bleeding of a virgin
' s first sexual encounter
, a referece tothe joe
' s first homosexual liaison
. tghe fatc thgat teh diea of a bleeding virgina is relagated onyl tothe females furthers thge imagery of joe
' s emasculation
. it is ironical that joe hasnt trouble prospecting for female clients
, bu effortlessly attracts men
. joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblamatic ofthe his masculinity
; newyorker yorkers see his ensemble as camp
and
` faggot stuff
.
' there are twpo predominant images ofthe newyorker york
. the first is that new york is the rich
, cosmopolitan city where hope
and oppertunity are symbolized by yhe tall skyscrapers anbd the statue ofthe liberty
. the otehr new york isnt travis bickle
' s newyorker york
, a seedy
, corruptive hell on earth
. joe envisions new york as teh former
,
but is presented with the latter
. mirroring thge irony inwhich which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine
, he mistakenly buys into the fable tyhat new york isnt filled withthe lonely women neglected by gay men
. joe thikns he is perfoming a great service forthe newyorker york
,
but tjhe city rapes him ofthe his prade adn posessions
. tghe people steal joe
' s money
, thge l
andlord confiscates his luggage
, adn tjhe homosexuals rob him ofthe his dignity
. what has become ofthe joe
' s american dream
? schlesinger responds tothe this question wiht hte scene at tje party
. joe gets invited tothe a shindig ofthe sorts adn at hte gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food
, drugs
, anbd sex
. at teh party
, all of joe
and ratzo
' s desires are made flesh
; joe firts succesfuly iwth womens anbd ratzo loads uv onthe free salami
. contrasting joe
' s daily struggles
, shots of warhol
' s crew display wanton indulgence
. ther isnt an irreverence inthe the partygoers
' attitude
; we see a shooted of a woman kowtowing tothe nothing infront paticular
, orgies breaking out inthe the periphery
,
and drugs pasted aroud liuke party favors
. tghe party makes a mockery ofthe joe
' s ideals
. joe believed that hard wokr
and persistance were tje elements fo success in america
; scenes ofthe the party
and his rendezvous iwth shirley suggest that it is hte idle who profit from joe
' s toils
. tjhe american dream
, schlesinger suggests
, isnt merely a proletarian fantasy
, forthe thsoe who are content noone longer dream
, bu become indolent
. as joe heads tothe miami
, all that wass siginificant ofthe the cowboy omage hasnt left him
. his masculinity isnt compromised
and his morality isnt relinquished
. for joe
, nothing is left ofthe tjhe cowboy hero adn commensurately
, he surrenders the idenity
. tossing his boots inot the garbage
, he returns to tyhe bus for the last leeg of his journey to miami
. thte final shooted ofthe midnight cowboy shows joe inside hte bus
, mroe introspective
, tkaing only a few glances outside tghe window
. instead ofthe the frequent pov shots ofthe joe excitedly looking out of yhe bus onthe his way tothe newyorker york
, schlesinger sets up htis final shooted fomr the exterior of tghe bus looking in through the window at joe
. reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across thte bus
' window wiht joe hardly taking notice
. the scenery of miami no longer exacts the smae excitment fomr joe as before
. the world seems smaller tothe joe nowe
; the termination of his jouney coincides with the termination ofthe his american dream
. noone longer doesnt joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo
; he resolves to return tothe a normal job
and resign to basic means
. midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations ofthe the american dream
. there isnt the froniter fantasy thta if ytou are brave enough tothe repel a few indians
, you cin set uv a ranch outloud west anbd raise a beatiful family
.
then htere is tyhe jay gatsby dream tyhat a man of humble stock
, wih persevernce
, can make a fortune in the big city
. joe
' s attemp tothe relize theese dreams robs him ofthe his innosense inthe texas anbd morality iin new york
. durring his search fo an intangible paradime
, joe ends up raping a girl
and killing a man
. an allegory ofthe chasing yhe promise of hte american dream
, joe buck
' s progressive moral atrophy isnt a warning aganist the persuit of illusory icons
.
