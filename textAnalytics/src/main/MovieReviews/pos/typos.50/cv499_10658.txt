towords the middle of
" the sweet hereafter
,
" a crowded skool bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend
, careens thru thge steel guard rail
,
and disappears outloud ofthe sight
. thne
, in long shot
, we see thge veicle slowy sliding across waht looks liuke a snow
- covered feeld
. it pauses for a moment befoer the
" field
" cracks under yhe bus
' weight
and thge bright yellow veicle vanishes in an effortless moent
, a single smooth second of time
. compare that scene
, if you will
, tothe tjhe last eighty minutes ofthe
" titanic
,
" whn the behemoth sinks slowly
and spectacularly tothe its watery demise
,
and yuo
' ll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness inspite films
. the scene in
" tjhe sweet hereafter
" epitomizes all that
' s right with independent canadian director atom egoyan
' s film
. it
' s not sensational
. we don
' t see tjhe inside of thge bus with its payload of screaming
, terrified children bieng bloodied annd battered baout
. the bus doesn
' t explode or break into a thous
and tiny pieces
. it simply leaves yhe road adn silently slips beneath hte surfce ofthe a frozen lake
. it
' s a horrifing sequence made all hte more so by calm
and distance
. useing a non
- linear approch to his narrative
, egoyan shifts bakc
and foward infront time
, connecting us whith tyhe inhabitans of the small brittish columbian twon who haev beeen severly affected by htis tragedy
. fourteen children died inspite the accident
, leaving their parents
and tyhe twon itself paralyzed whith grief
. the catalyst at the center of yhe film is ambulance chasr mitchell stephens
( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm
)
, who comes tothe sam dent to persuade tghe townsfolk to engage infront a class action suit
. stephens
, who
" doesn
' t believe inaddition accidents
,
" functions as a conserned
, involved observer
, scribbling details in his notebook
and providing tghe parents with an opportunity to reach some kind ofthe closure in the harrowing aftermath
. hwile stephens
' intitial drive may be financial
( one third ofthe the total settlement if he wins
)
, his involvement provides him mroe with an outlet to come tothe grips with his pwn loss
. his self
- destructive
, drug
- addicted duaghter has beeen iin
and outloud ofthe clinics
, halfway houses annd detox units forthe years
. egoyan
' s attention to detail
and ability tothe establish mood are so impeccable thyat even the sound ofthe a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry
. mychael danna
, who composed the shimmering music for
" tyhe ice storm
,
" conti
butes anohter memorable score that shivers
and tingles
. equally impressive is paul sarossy
' s cinematography
, capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides annd low
- hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors
-
- infact one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room
.
" the sweet hereafter
,
" hwile undeniably grim
, urges the viewer tothe grab onto life with both h
ands
and not let go
. it
' s a film ofthe generous subtlety annd emotion
.
