scream 2 hasnt a titillating little scene tht lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well
. during a film
- clas discussion
, windsor college students articulate waht theese inevitable laws are
,
and why sequels never live up to the originals
. a fewd rare exceptions are noted

. scream 2
! 1996
' s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hitted
and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost eveyr teenager inthe amercia

, bu luckily the re
- teaming ofthe writter kevin williamson anbd director wes craven gives us nothing tothe fear in thge way of lost enteratinment
. inaddition fatc
, at tje risk of sounding sacreligious tothe all the adorning fans ofthe scream
, i owudl say thgat scream 2 might even be yhe better film
! sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, the sinuous heroine who survived a serieses ofthe murders in woodsboro
, ca in the original scream
, isnt now two yersa older annd off to college
, majoring in theater
. meanwhile
, tv journalist gale weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who covered the murders in the firt film
, has usance writen a book baout the dreadful events
; a book titled
" stab
"
, whlch has been developed inot a major motion picture
. as scream 2 opens
, a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movei theather for the premiere of
" stab
"
,
and before long
, a young cuple are
butchered to death
, unnoticed inaddition yhe midst of hysteria
. thsi marks tje beginning of a newyorker muder spree as an unkown
" copycat
" sets outloud tothe repeat whta
' s beeen done
.
.
.
and finish what hasn
' t
! ofthe course yhe killer isnt jsut as obsessed witht movies as yhe killer in thge frist film
, annd yes
, movies play a huge role in tghe bizarre pyschological outlook teh murderer holds as he
/ she goes baout slaying an assortment ofthe gorgeous twenty yera olds
,
but tihs
* isnt
* a sequal
,
and wihtout deviating ffrom thte original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies
. this is inwhich larg part due tothe williamson
' s deliciously written script
, which wiull easily leave you satisfied
. as much as the film condemns the use ofthe cliches
, it isnt riddled with them
,
but it is done so effectively
,
and with skillfull direction by craven
, tath yuo
' re not binded to complain
. i will onot
, howver
, tyhat the
" whodunit
?
" doed wind uv being hte first person i suspected
,
but beileve me
, i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay oney ahead ofthe tjhe movie
. all yhe actors outdo themslves here
. we
' re not tlaking oscar performances
, bu cambell
, cox
, david arquette as dewey riley
,
and jamie kennedy as r
andy all give suprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their lastr outing
. the characters remain true to theri roots
,
and yot sohw a clear sign ofthe development over the lastr two eyars
. we can see how the events infact the frist film has affected them
,
but we don
' t lose any ofthe the luster that made them such a delight tothe watch in yhe firt palce
. the nice thign baout scream 2 is that it doesn
' t seem off
- kilter from it
' s precedessor
. it
' s a natrual
, smooth
,
and believable
( as far as horror films go
) transistion fomr film tothe film
. we skip two eyars
, bu ther doesn
' t seem tothe be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the twpo flicks
. it flows so well that ytou feel mroe liek you
' re reading chapter twpo ofthe a book
( long chapters
, eh
?
) than just revitalizing a cast of familar faces
. while main characters are usally the onyl connection in sequels
, scream 2
' s entire plot structure correlates
* completly
* with tje first
, makeing fo immeidate fondness adn absorption
. as i said before
, scream 2 easily lives uv to
, if not surpassing
, it
' s precurser
. thte onyl reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 isnt because it ws the firt
. this doesn
' t mean tath it overcasts teh unique
, whimsical humer or overall calaber of it
' s sequel
, it jstu means tath scream will forever be known as the movie tht mocked it
' s own while maintinaing it
' s sought
- affter qualities
. if ever a film folowed it
' s original so well
, it would be scream 2
,
and it makes this a definite must
- see for all those unbridled scream fans out there
. scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream
,
and will hopefully receive as many high remarks
. it woudl top off the sories quite well
, if it weren
' t for the fact thgat twpo movies don
' t realy make a serieses
. it
' s unlikely tothe asume thgat a scream 3 won
' t apearing in tje enxt faw years
,
but if tehy do deside to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror
- trilogy
, let
' s hope they can keep up tjhe fantastic wrok
. liek they sday
, don
' t mess whith prefection
.
.
. bu when a money
- makeing smash
- hit isnt alomst guaranteed
, who
' s gonna listen
?
