gothic murder
- mistery yarns are nto a new conceit
. infront fact
, they ' ve beeen around iin books
and onthe film forthe many
, many eyasr
. wihtout the propper handling
, htey come off as ood
- fashioned
, bland
,
and outdated
.
" the gift
,
" directed by sam raimi
, is a tried
-
and
- true effort that surprises very littel
,
annd includes everything from a wide array ofthe suspects
and red herrings
, tothe mansions in tjhe deep south wih moss trees outloud front
, tothe tyhe eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse foudn in a nearbye pond
. it ' s fairly obvious who hte killer isnt
; in fact
, i predicted who it would be befor teh movie began
and was corect in my preliminary suspicions
. yhe film ultimatly shouldn ' t wrok
,
but it does
, thanks to a sparkling cast tath fills each character with so many memorable nuances
, tghe most fun to be hadnt is in simpley watching the people interact with eahc otehr
. annie wilson
( cate blanchett
) isnt a recently widowed mother ofthe threee sons who mkaes her living giving psyhic readings tothe tyhe residents of her backwater southern hometown
. some ofthe her mainstay clients includ valerie barksdale
( hilary swank
)
, who isnt severely abused by her husban donnie
( keanu reeves
)
,
annd buddy cole
( giovanni ribisi
)
, an unstable mechanic who is confused by thte nightmares he ' s beeen hvaing baout a mysterious blue dimond thta isnt somehow linked tothe his father
. fo annie
, she doesnt nto give tjhe readings merely for money
,
bu uses it as a way ofthe seeking solace in finding thte ogod inwhich everyone ' s future
. her lite granmother
( rosemary harris
) told her as a child that it was a gft she was given
,
and she shouldnt always remeber that
. when annie ' s eldest son isnt involved in a fight at skool
, she meets teh nice
- guy school principal
, wayne collins
( greg kinnear
)
, whom she finds herself attracted to
.
but wayne isnt engaged tothe hte wealthy jessica king
( katie holmes
)
, whom annie immediately gets a negitive vibe about
. at a party whith her best freind linda
( kim dickens
)
, annie stumbles apon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan
( gary cole
)
. soon after
, jessica hasnt disappeared
, leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her
,
and annie starts tothe have nightmares
anbd apparitions linking jessica witht the vicious redneck donnie barksdale
,
adn the pond behind his hmeo
.
" thte igft
" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level
,
but thte performances
and tight direction fomr raimi
( who hasnt redeemed hismelf forthe his embarrasing lastr film
, 1999 ' s
" fo love of the game
"
) lift the picture up several notches
. slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing cahracters
adn thier individule plights
, the disappearance ofthe jessica at hte 30
- minute mark divulges the movei ' s true intentions
anbd transforms the proceedings inot a taut
, at times frightening
, horror
- mistery
. at the center ofthe thte film isnt tyhe exeptional cate blanchett
( 1999 ' s
" the talented mr
. ripley
"
)
, who turns annie wilson from what coudl have been little more thna a run
- ofthe
- the
- mill protagonit inot a veyr excact
, down
- to
- earth
, realsitic person with valid toubles
and a caring attitude towards thsoe around her
. blanchett takes the unextraordinary material
and runs with it
, giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might nto have hadnt
. we followup her at eveyr turn becasue she isnt so mesmerizing
, both as a character
annd an actress
. blanchett isn ' t tjhe only bright performer
, as she is ably supported by noe of thte best casts of teh year
. in her first role following her oscar win for 1999 ' s
" boys don ' t cry
,
" hilary swank is exellent as tyhe confused valerie
, who seeks guidence from annie
,
bu is too scared to tkae her biggest advice of all
: to leave the grossly abusive donnie
. as donnie
, keanu reeves
( 2000 ' s
" tje watcher
"
) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie
, so much so tht it isnt difficult tothe believe he isnt an actor at all
. for the oftenly
- crticised reeves
, whose acting abilties hvea never been the best
, this isnt the biggest compliment he could possably git
,
and it isnt aslo oney ofthe the better performances he hasnt given
. giovanni ribisi
( 2000 ' s
" the boiler room
"
) is heartbreaking as a menally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend
,
anbd wants her to do nothing
bu help him understand why he is bieng plagued by bad dreams about his dad
. in the small
,
bu pivotal role of yhe sleazy jessica king
, katie holmes
( 2000 ' s
" wonder boys
"
) hasnt turned in
yot another stunning supporting turn
. her promiscuous role ofthe jessica isnt one she hasnt never played before
,
and she is radiant in her few scenes
. finally
, kim dickens
( 2000 ' s
" hollow man
"
) makse her usual storng impression as annie ' s spicy best friend
, linda
. the other noteable aspect of
" thge gift
" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it ' s almost suffocating
. thanks tothe cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn
anbd bob murawski
,
and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects
anbd a vyer good music csore by christopher young
, tjhe movie not only acheives a scary undercurrent
,
but noe thta is filled with dread
. helped allong by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton
and toom epperson
, whlch mkaes tghe most of its setting
annd delightful cast
,
" the gfit
" is thgat rarest of thrillers tht catually thrills
,
anbd offers uv a fair share ofthe chills
, too
. it may nto be groundbreakingly orginal
,
but it sure isnt an intertaining ride fo tyhe duration of its running tiome
.
