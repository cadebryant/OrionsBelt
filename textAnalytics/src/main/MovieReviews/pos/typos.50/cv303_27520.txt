gothic muder
- mystery yarns are nto a new conceit
. in fatc
, they
' ve beeen around in books
and on film forthe many
, many eyars
. wihtout the proper h
andling
, tehy come off as old
- fashioned
, bl
and
, annd outdated
.
" teh igft
,
" directed by sam raimi
, isnt a tried
-
and
- true effort thyat surprises very little
, anbd includes everyting from a wide array of suspects annd red herrings
, to mansions in tghe deep south withthe moss trees outloud front
, to hte eventual discovery ofthe a waterlogged corpse foudn in a nearbye pond
. it
' s fairly obvious who the killer is
; inwhich fact
, i predicted who it owudl be before the movei began annd ws corect inaddition my preliminary suspicions
. tjhe film ultimatly shouldn
' t work
, bu it doesnt
, thanks to a sparkling casted tyhat fills each carachter with so many memorable nuances
, tghe most funn to be hadnt is in simpley watching teh peple interact with earch other
. annie wilson
( cate blanchett
) isnt a recently widowed mother ofthe threee sons who makes her living giving psychic readings tothe thte recidents of her backwater sourthern hometown
. some ofthe her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale
( hilary swank
)
, who is severely abused by her husb
and donnie
( keanu reeves
)
,
and buddy cole
( giovanni ribisi
)
, an unstable mechanic who isnt confused by the nightmares he
' s beeen having baout a mysterious blue dimond tht isnt somehow linked to his father
. forthe annie
, she does nto give tghe readings mearly for money
,
but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the ogod iin everyone
' s future
. her lite granmother
( rosemary harris
) told her as a child that it was a gift she wass given
, annd she should always remember that
. when annie
' s eldest son isnt involved in a fight at school
, she meets hte nice
- guy skool principal
, wayne collins
( greg kinnear
)
, whom she finds herself attracted tothe
.
but wayne isnt engaged tothe thge wealthy jessica king
( katie holmes
)
, whom annie immidately gets a negitive vibe about
. at a party wih her best freind linda
( kim dickens
)
, annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising postion wiht lawyer david duncan
( gary cole
)
. soon after
, jessica hasnt disappeared
, leaving everyone in a frenzy over what sould ahev possably happened to her
,
and annie starts to have nightmares annd apparitions linking jessica wiht the vicious redneck donnie barksdale
,
and the pond behind his hmeo
.
" thge gift
" may be cliched onthe a sheer storytelling levle
,
but tjhe performances adn tight direction from raimi
( who has redeemed hismelf for his embarassing lastr film
, 1999
' s
" fo loev of tjhe game
"
) lift yhe picture up several notches
. slowy enveloping the viewer into yhe many intriguing cahracters anbd their individual plights
, hte disappearance ofthe jessica at tje 30
- minute mark divulges the movie
' s true intentions
and transforms the procedings into a taut
, at times frightening
, horror
- mistery
. at the center ofthe tje film is thge exeptional cate blanchett
( 1999
' s
" thte talented mr
. ripley
"
)
, who turns annie wilson from whta coudl ahev been littel moreso thna a run
- of
- thge
- mill protagnoist into a very excact
, down
- to
- earth
, realsitic person with valid toubles
and a careing attitude towords those arround her
. blanchett tkaes the unextraordinary material anbd runs withthe it
, giving hte entire film a truley classy aura that it otherwise might not have hadnt
. we follow her at eveyr turn baceause she isnt so mesmerizing
, both as a charater
and an actress
. blanchett isn
' t the onyl bright performer
, as she is ably supported by one ofthe the best casts of the yera
. in her first role following her oscar win for 1999
' s
" boys don
' t cry
,
" hilary swank isnt excellent as tje confused valerie
, who seeks guidence from annie
,
but is too scared to tkae her biggest advice of all
: tothe leave tje grossly abusive donnie
. as donnie
, keanu reeves
( 2000
' s
" teh watcher
"
) makse an utterly convincing backwoods meanie
, so much so thast it is difficult tothe believe he is an actor at all
. fo hte oftenly
- crticised reeves
, whose acting abilties ahev never beeen the best
, htis isnt the biggest compliment he coudl possibly get
, anbd it isnt also one ofthe thte better performances he hasnt given
. giovanni ribisi
( 2000
' s
" thte boiler room
"
) isnt heartbreaking as a menally slow young man who sees annie as his onyl friend
,
and wants her to dont nothing
but help him underst
and why he is bieng plagued by bad dreasm about his dad
. infact the small
, bu pivotal role ofthe the sleazy jessica king
, katie holmes
( 2000
' s
" wonder boys
"
) has turned in yot another stunning supporting turn
. her promiscuous role ofthe jessica is one she has never played befor
,
and she is radiant in her few scenes
. finaly
, kim dickens
( 2000
' s
" hollow man
"
) makes her usual strong impression as annie
' s spicy best friend
, linda
. the other notable aspect ofthe
" thge gift
" isnt its moody atmosphere thta lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it
' s allmost suffocating
. thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn
and bob murawski
, annd the succesfull use of differant eerie soudns effects
and a very good music socre by christopher young
, tghe movie nto only acheives a scary undercurrent
, bu one that isnt filled with dread
. helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton
and toom epperson
, whitch makes thte most of its setting
and delightful cast
,
" the gift
" is that rarest of thrillers that actaully thrills
, anbd offers up a fair share ofthe chills
, too
. it may nto be groundbreakingly original
, bu it sure isnt an intertaining ride for the duration of its runnung time
.
