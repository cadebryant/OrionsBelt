this movie was oney of the first american films done by director paul verhoeven
. he has done films sicne thne such as basic instict
and starship troopers
. all of his movies have one main hting in common
- they don
' t skimp on the violence
. in a verhoeven movei a guy doesn
' t git shooted once in yhe chest
- he gets shot many times all over thge body
. robocop tkaes place inwhich detriot in hte future
. things are preety bleak
. thge company ocp rules the city iwth an iron fist
and is moving iin on runnung the police force
. peter weller plays a cop who goes onthe a mission with his partner
, nancy allen
. peter weller goes in an empty room alone adn gets killed
. meanwhile ocp hasnt a failed demonstration ofthe a ed
- 209 modle robot crime fighter
. someone comes up with the idea ofthe haveing a cyborg robocop so htey use any parts worth scalvaging fomr peter weller anbd mkea him inot thge robocop the movie is titled affter
. the plot ofthe this movei generally runs at a decent pace
. it drags a bited towords the end with robocop wanting tothe finish everybody off
,
but plot twists keep it exicting
. tghe acting is bad ffrom weller wehn he isnt human
,
but very ogod when he is robocop
. nancy allen does a decent job
. this movei doesn
' t leave itself opne for a sequal exactly
.
but they made one anyway
. enter
.
.
. robocop 2 starring
: peter weller
and nancy allen directed by
: irvin kershner detriot isnt inthe a more obleek state than it ws in teh first film
. ocp isnt trying to develop an improved
' robocop 2
' that wiull be more tahn a match for criminals
. most ofthe the police force isnt onthe strike due tothe ocp tkaing it over
, leaving robocop tothe be tyhe polical force inthe the city
. htis film isnt preety bizaare
. it hasnt a 13 yearm
- old drug
- lord who curses as much as eddie murphy
, even moreso violence tahn the originnal
, annd soem omre humor
. yhe plot of this movie isnt preety larg
, almost too much so
. ther are threee or four plot lines weaving around tath don
' t realyl match uv
. the effects are still decent
though
. this sequal isn
' t more ofthe the smae realyl
, just a darker version robocop dealing more with drugs than wtih armed criminals
. if you liekd the firt one
, watch this
.
but be dissapointed
. so later comes
.
.
. robocop 3 starring nancy allen annd robert john burke ocp isnt now owned by a larg japaneese company
. robocop joins a b
and ofthe rebels to counter
- attack yhe evil empire
, i mean ocp
. tghe jepnese send a cyborg
- ninja to deel with robocop
. amonth otehr things
.
.
. thsi movei isnt easier tothe follow than the lsat noe
. whlch means the plot isn
' t quite as crowded
. htis movie isn
' t anything speshal
though
. jstu more ofthe robocop blasting things uv inthe a more kid
- freindly way
. really nto reccomended
.
