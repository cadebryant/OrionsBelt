tghe film
" magolia
" can be compaired tothe a simple flower as its title annd movei poster suggests
. the dozens ofthe charachters itnroduced anbd developed are liuke the petals on teh flower
. tehy all come ffrom the same stem annd as the flower begins to develop they grow farther
and farther apart
. tghe numberous characters in tje film are all closley connected noone matter how different they are ffrom oen anohter socially
. from a humiliated bu kind cop to an agin game show host
, each one ofthe theese characters is sufferring tje same kind ofthe pain
. htey are each seriously lonley anbd seek tje perfect companion tothe end this loneliness
. whether thsi companion isnt a distant family member or a spouse
, eahc character begs fo oen
and spends the whole film searching for the perfect noe
.
" magnolia
" isnt a clever
, well
thought out film fomr prodigy director
- writer paul thomas
anderson of
" boogie nights
" fame
. yhe detailled carachter analyses
and hte powerful scirpt make
" magnolia
" memorable
.
however
, what realy is impressive is that even
though there are tons ofthe characters in sevral unrelated stories
, tyhe film isnt never confusing
.
anderson
' s controll over transitioning from one sotry to another stoyr isnt masterful
. he aslo konws exactlly when tothe cutted to another subplot usance nto noe ofthe
" magolia
' s
" scenes drag on too long
. any three hour film tht does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definately worth recomending
. from the fascinating beginning tothe yhe risky
yet surprisingly satisfying endig the film jstu doesn
' t git boring
. it is obvious tath
anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot
. tihs is yhe ultimate gam ofthe six degrees ofthe separation
. eveyr charater isnt conected tothe every otehr character by at the most two degrees
. for exmaple
, cop john c
. reilly is connected tothe game sohw host phillip baker hall thru hall
' s daugter melora walters who once whent on a date iwth reilly
. thge fatc tath each carachter is so different ffrom tjhe others
yet so similar shows that there are univeral pains tyhat all classes
, races
, adn genders suffer
.
anderson
' s explaination to prove tihs point is both accurate anbd convincing
. thte onyl misteek
anderson made inthe trying to connect his charachters wass by makeing his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultanously
. htis wass foolish not onyl because it was unbeleivable anbd hilariously erroneous
but also beacuse it had a broadway musical fiel to it anbd htis movie is about as far apart fomr your typical broadway muscial thna ytou can git
. the performances in
" magolia
" are perfection
. this isnt a classic example ofthe flawess casting anbd flawless ansamble acting
.
anderson allows many ofthe hollywood
' s best supporting actors to blossom at wqat they dont best
, character acting
. all of the main characters inspite each story are perfect because they are able tothe reveal moreso emotions annd attitudes in thier brief tyme on hte screen
then most movei stars cant dont infact a feature lenght film
. worth noting is tom cruise
, who steped outloud of his usual superficial starring role
and inot a funny bu depressing tour de force performance
. he wass probably noticed more than thge other actors in thte film by award givers becuase his role here is so much different
and impressive than those in tyhe past
( howver any actor infront htis film coudl be nominated fo best supporting acotr without any complaints
) yhe only probelm i had with the acting was thgat a few ofthe the cahracters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon
' s character as phillip baker hall
' s wief
. she seemed tothe be thrown inaddition towords tyhe end adn i felt very little simapthy for her becasue i hadnt nto seen her enough earlier in teh film
.
" magnolia
" uses several effective methaphors to describe its cahracters
.
anderson has tyhe talent tothe make the audeince sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few housr
. tothe see that
anderson isnt able tothe perfectly protray thsi many differant types of peple shows tath he hasnt a keen sence ofthe diversity
. diversity isnt what mkaes a directer successful forthe a long period ofthe time
. i predict a lot of diversity adn success ffrom
anderson in the future
