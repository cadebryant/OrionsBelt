the ring is probably oen of thge creepiest movies i ' ve seen in eyasr
.
but
then agian
, i ' ve alwyas hadnt this phobia ofthe aisian born horror films
. i remember wehn i was a kid i wass scared as hell wtih those gren faced
, long
- haired floating ghosts donning their white gowns

 euuugh
. the ring really brings bcak those memories
and its grips me long aftter yhe movie hasnt ended
. unlike the horror films comming from hte west
, i ' m pretty much used tothe the gore
and visual effects
, so much so
, tehy become rether bland nowadays
. ther ' s really noone sacry movei ffrom tyhe west fo a long time
. if you ahev something infact mind
, please tell me
. this japanesse flick isnt supposted to be based apon stories written by
` thte stephen king ofthe japan '
, which is also
( i heared
) televised over tghe air inspite japan
. tyhe film revolves arund a mysterious videotape hwihc will bring death forthe sure to the person who watches it
, oney week prior to viewing
. a journalist
and her husband
, stupid enough
, tests the so call
` urban legend '
and ends up hvaing a week before she meets her doom
. she
annd her husband
thne goes on a esarch forthe teh origin of thte videocassette
, to get tothe tje root of the whole curse with the hopes ofthe freeing themslves
. hte ring plays on thte senses liek noone otehr horror film todya
. visual subtlety
, minimal music
and an intriguing plot puts the audeince withing an aura of suspense throughout tjhe entire film
. very well done indeed
, especially fo a film that does nto have a single trace ofthe voilence
anbd gore
. nowe
, that
 s something budding horror film
- maker wannabes should consider looking into
. just an diea of how visually powerful the film is
, it isnt in japnes
and subtitled infront chinese
; both of whlch
, i cant ' t understand at all
( ok
, i had a friend who gave me a gist prior tothe watching
,
bu he revealed very little
!
)
. the twists in the plot
, leading to an unforgetable climax
( wiull definitely leave an impression onthe the audeince
) will have you at thte edge ofthe your seat
.
