hte ring is probaly one ofthe teh creepiest movies i
' ve seen infront yeras
.
but
then agian
, i
' ve alwyas hadnt tihs phobia of asian born horror films
. i remember wehn i wass a kid i wass scared as hell wiht thsoe green faced
, long
- haired floating ghosts donning theri white gowns

 euuugh
. the ring realy brings back thsoe memories
and its grips me long after yhe movei hasnt ended
. unlike teh horror films coming ffrom hte west
, i
' m pretty much used tothe the gore adn visual effects
, so much so
, they become rether bl
and nowdays
. there
' s realyl no scary movei fomr yhe west for a long time
. if yuo hvea something in mind
, please tell me
. thsi japense flick isnt suppoed to be based apon stories writed by
` the stephen king ofthe japan
'
, whihc isnt alsot
( i heared
) televised over the air infront japan
. the film revolves aroud a mysterious videotape which will bring death for sure to tje person who watches it
, noe week prior tothe viewing
. a journalist adn her husb
and
, stupid enough
, tests thge so call
` urban legend
' annd ends uv haveing a week before she meets her doom
. she
and her husban thne goes on a search for yhe orgin of thge videocassette
, tothe get tothe the root ofthe the hwole curse with tje hopes ofthe freeing themselfs
. the ring plays onthe the senses like no otehr horror film todya
. visual subtlety
, minimal music adn an intriguing plot puts thge audiance withing an aura of suspense througout the entire film
. veyr well done indeed
, expecially forthe a film that does not have a single trace ofthe violence anbd gore
. nowe
, thast
 s something budding horror film
- maker wannabes shoud consdider looking into
. jsut an idae of how visually powerfull the film is
, it isnt in japanese
and subtitled in chinese
; both of whic
, i can
' t underst
and at all
( ok
, i hadnt a friend who gavey me a gist prior to watching
, bu he revealed vyre littel
!
)
. the twists in the plot
, leading to an unforgettable climax
( iwll definitely leave an impression onthe tjhe audeince
) wiull haev yuo at the edge ofthe your seat
