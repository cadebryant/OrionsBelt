ultra low budget bu extremly inventive horror film baout a gropu ofthe firends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force infact the woods via the necronomicon
, hte book of teh dead
. bruce campbell stars as ash
, who eventially becomes the sole survivor
and hasnt to battle both the demons fomr the woods
, anbd his friends who have become demons
( including his pwn girlfriend
)
. the results shown on screen are amazing concidering the film
' s tiny budget
, constatn loction changes
, anbd a filming schedule that ws sporatic over twpo years
. followed by two sequels
: evil dead ii
( 1987
)
and army of darkness
( 1993
)
. thte dvd release of tihs film from elite entertainment contains hte film in it
' s original aspect ratio of 1
. 33
: 1
. thte disc containes two versions ofthe the film
' s audio
: a stereo 2
. 0 track
and a newely remastered dolby digital 5
. 1
. included are twpo separate runing commentary tracks
: the frist features writer
/ directer sam raimi anbd producer rob tapert
and yhe second track features the film
' s star
, bruce campbell
. campbell
' s commentary isnt informative
and extremely witty
, as he has a stoyr tothe tell fo virtually eveyr scene in tghe film
. such informative tidbits inlude
: thge origional title ofthe tyhe film wass gogin tothe be book ofthe the dead
(
and inaddition fact whn the film premeired in 1981 that wass it
' s title
)
and wehn they were asked tothe change the title to the evil dead
, everyone throught it wass the worst title they hadnt ever heared
. alsot
, ther
' s a scene easly onthe inspite the film where thte group sist around
and listens tothe a tape recorder which tehy
' ve foudn thta
' s explaining baout thte demonic forces inthe the woods
. forthe tyhat scene
, it was written fo the charachters tothe be smoking marijuana
, so bieng tje wacky kids thast htey were at the time
, they decided tothe actualy smoke marijuana for the scene
. almsot all of thast footage bacame unusable because many ofthe the actor
' s hadnt never smoked before
, anbd as a result htey bacame
" confuzled
" annd weere unable to peform the scene
. i wish tjhe entertainment factor was as high for tje sam raimi
/ rob tapert audio track
. the twpo people you
' d think woudl be omre enthuseastic in tlaking baout thsi film instade barely have much tothe say at all
. don
' t git me wrong here
, whn tehy dont speak it
' s intertaining to hear
,
but htere are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time
. sometimes aftter oen of those long silences rob will ask
" have anytying to say sam
?
" tothe me
, tath
' s nto a good sign
. aslo
, it seems like sam raimi doesn
' t remember much baout teh film adn it
' s production
.
.
. well
, compaired tothe rob anbd bruce anyway
. also included on yhe disc isnt a photo gallery
( which includes pictures from the film
' s
" gala
" premiere
) anbd about twenty minutes ofthe raw footage fomr the film
. this raw footage really shows yuo how much a film cin be improved upon useing simple audio techniques
. overall
, tje evil dead is a good low budget horror film
, superior tothe many films infact it
' s genre
. adn tyhe collector
' s edition dvd release isnt well worth your timne if ytou
' re eather a fan of hte film or just a fan of the filmmaking proces
. all special edition dvds should be this throrough anbd intertaining
.
