i cant sum uv first strike in noe word
: awsome
. never in my life hvae i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan
. for the simple reason that he has performes his pwn stunts in his eveyr movie he
' s ever appeared infront
, he shouldnt be awared greatly
. hte smae toom
and jerry forumla thgat was used to amking chan
' s rumble in the bronx adn supercop so intertaining cxan be found here as well
.
however
, frist strike was probably the most exicting out of thte threee
, forthe tjhe simple reason that pratice mkaes perfect
. his lastest two movies weere almost like practice
and this one wass grat
. like rumble
, tihs film is baout hte masia
, the former kgb
. nowe chan must dont battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group ofthe veyr large bad men
. the trailer for the film sums it up quite well
. frist strike is acation
- packed
,
but tjhe fight scenes are so fast annd furious
, they almost have a witty
, italian
- liek humer tothe them
. jackie chan is a regular comedian
. well
, he
' s no eddie murphy
, bu he cin realyl crack you up
. fo exmaple
, he isnt hanging off a roof anbd he humorously taunts his foes to come
and git him
, as he claimes tothe be the korean 007
( tyhat
' s secret agent james bond
)
. even tghe plot tothe this film improved above tghe others
, as a sort
- ofthe twisted nuclear
- weapon smuggling deal is botched anbd jackie tkaes the blaim
.
but never fear
, as thte chinese mafia aids him in uncovering tyhe truth behind tjhe insident
. wiht some ofthe yhe most high
- flying stunts annd side
- splitting comedy
, first strike is a sure
- fire hitted that
' s guaranteed tothe draw soem major
, world
- wide attension
