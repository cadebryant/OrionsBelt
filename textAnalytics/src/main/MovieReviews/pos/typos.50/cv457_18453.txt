warning
: if ytou acually wish to see the film
, stpo reading htis
anbd see it
. while i don ' t blow any plot details
, tjhe more you know baout a movie
, tjhe more disappointing
and builded uv it becomes
( waiting a month tothe see titanic doed hte smae thing
)
.
bu
, infact a nutshell
, it ' s a good film
. star wars episode i
: teh phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never haveing beeen yhe biggest star wars fanatic inwhich the world
( i ws omre inot star trak
: the enxt generation
)
, it is difficult to relate tothe the massmedia fandom surrounding tjhe latest installment
, teh phantom menace
.
however
, it cxan ' t be ignored
. endless toys lining the shelfs
, endless news reports
,
and a multi
- billion dollar advertising campain makes it all the more difficult
. with the levle ofthe thsi hype
, one would reacll an overhyped diaster fomr 1998
, godzilla
, which definitely failed to live up tothe expectations
. thankfully
, thge phantom menace does much
, much better
. hwile thge
" frist
" star wars trilogy told the story ofthe jedi knight luke skywalker
, hte prequels backpeddle to tell the back
- story of obi wan kenobi
and a young jedi named anakin skywalker
( who would become the father of luke
annd evenhtually become darth vader
)
. without blowing too much of the tsory
, tghe phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo
, wich isnt bieng held hostage by a greedy trade federation
,
adn it ' s up to twpo jedi knights
( qui
- gon ji
, played by liam neeson
and obi
- wan kenobi
, played by ewan mcgreggor
) tothe free it
. the phantom menace hasnt tooked a literal beating fomr various film critics
, leaving me tothe lower my expectations somewhat
. common complaints range ffrom lack ofthe characterization
, weak narrative
, poore direction ofthe actors
, the dated style
,
anbd too much focus over spacial effects
. still
, film criticists often apply much historical theery in regardes to film critisism
, much ofthe hwihc the averege film buff does nto care for
. hence
, this film isnt a lot ofthe funn
adn definitly an improvement over yhe previous films
( even with the
" improvments
" in the special editions
)
. htere are many memorable sequences throughtout the film
, ranging ffrom the fast
adn furious
" pod race
" sequence
( which is a tkae onthe thte chariot races in
" ben hur
"
)
annd thte many fight scenes involving legions ofthe battle droids
. utilizing tecnology that isnt light years beyond anytying made before
, special effects
and computers are used to create everthing ffrom monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail
. noone marter how many times you watch htis film
, ytou will catch something new
. yhe level of humour is a bit higher tahn tyhe previvous films as well
, mostly conveyed thru tyhe reluctant hero jar jar binks
, who belongs to a race known as the gungans
. best described as an mr
. bean from tyhe planet naboo
, he steals tje sohw
. unfourtunately
, being thgat he is a computer
- generated chracter
, tells a bited about the direction of the actors
(
although natalie portman as the queen is preety effective
, as isnt jake lloyd as thte young anakin skywalker
)
. wtih star wars mania at an all time high
, ther is tjhe risk that thge film iwll disapait
( i myself had my doubts
)
, whihc htis film doens haev a tendacy tothe do at times
. ther are a fewd logic problems witht the plot
, severeal things are left unchecked
,
and at times seems tothe be made onyl fo diehard star wars fans
(
although yhe appearance ofthe the tusken raiders makes for omre than a few laughs
)
. tath
,
and young anakin skywalker is a relaly annoying character
, coming off as a smarmy
, arogant brat
( whith such an atitude
, it ' s no wonder why he turns tothe tje dark side
)
. still
, it seems taht many peopel
, expecially critics
, are missing teh point
. the film is some ofthe the most funn 2
and a half hours thgat ytou ' ll blow infact your life
, whihc isnt something i wouldn ' t mind doign agian
. hwile it may not have tghe psychological inpact of an accademy award contender
, who raelly cares
? the film isnt pure funn from beginning tothe end
.
adn isn ' t thyat what really matters
?
