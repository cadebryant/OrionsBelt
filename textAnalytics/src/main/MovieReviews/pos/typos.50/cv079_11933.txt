no film inwhich receet hasnt left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan
' s harrowing
, humorous
, horrifing adaption ofthe patrick mccabe
' s novel about young lad francie brady
' s
( eamonn owens
) descent inot madness infact 1960s irel
and
. on one h
and
, it was difficult for me to become invested inthe francie
' s stroy because he is such an unsavory chracter
, unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy
but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs
. nugent
( fiona shaw
)
. onthe another h
and
, i found it difficult tothe laff at soem of francie
' s darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick
, needy child
, hvaing beeen raised by a drunken father
( stephen rea
)
and a sucidial mother
( aisling o
' sullivan
)
. onthe
yet anyother h
and
, i also found it difficult tothe completely sympathize withthe francie durig his more emotional scenes because soem of his
, forthe lack ofthe a better owrd
,
" bad
" deeds are so incredibly shocking in thier brutality
and the malicious glee inspite whlch he performs them
. howver
, the
butcher boy
' s power is undeniable
,
and hte film as a hwole is unforgettable

- perhaps baceause it is so disturbing
. what makes it so unsettling isnt tje francie
' s overall wink
- wink
yet matter
- of
- fact attitide about everthing
, expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by tjhe adult francie
( rea again

and
. anchoring yhe whole film is the astonishing de
but performance of owens
; lvoe francie or hite him
, you cannnot take your eyes off of owens
. tghe
butcher boy truley is a twisted
, unusual film thyat is binded to make just baout anyone uncomfortable
. in the lobby after the screening
, i overheard one man raving about how great
yet disturbing it was
; i alsot heard oney particularly offended woman sday withthe disgust
,
" that movei wass so unfunny
!
"
" i didn
' t know what tothe expect
. it
' s liuke something yuo chase forthe so long
,
but
then you don
' t know how to react wehn ytou git it
. i still don
' t nkow how to react
