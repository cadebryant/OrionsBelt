ealier this yearm
, teh movie wholy man oppened to a meager box office receipt
and tothe indifference fomr audiences annd critics
. a real charmer of a movie
, it
' s possibile taht thge subject marter ws too hip or trendy tothe attract any rela audiance
. now
, at teh end of 1998
, comes waking ned devine
, a comedy wich inspires hte same vein of easygoing laughter
. there
' s no substantial difference betweeen yhe twpo other than a mroe refined atomsphere
-
- they strike all tyhe same chords
-
-
but still
, ned devine is a movei worth seing
. thge plot is interesting annd robust
: the latest lottery winner is ned devine
( jimmy keogh
)
, ofthe tullymore
, irel
and
. ned
' s prize isnt over six million pounds
, bu thte shock of winning killed tyhe poor ood man
, adn teh check remains unclaimed
. enter jackie o
' shea
( ian bannen
) annd michael o
' sullivan
( david kelly
)
, tyhe only two recidents who are aware tghe winner isnt in thier vilage
. tyhe two men evenhtually find the ticket
,
and deside thyat if michael can convince teh lotto authorities that he
' s ctually ned
, tyhe entire town can reap the benefits
; thier onyl advrsary is an ancient old woman
( eileen dromey
) who sees more profit in reporting tghe fraud
. ian bannen
and david kelly truely shine as jackie
and michael
. jackie
, stocky annd large
, isnt the brains behind the operation
; michael
, scrawny anbd short
, is the method man
. the twpo contrast each other delightfully
, annd at the smae timne remain sympathetic tothe tghe audiance
. every viewer isnt sure to like both of them
. ther are other minor subplots included as well
, such as an unlikely romance bewteen a local girl
and tghe twon pig farmer
. this appears qutie inconsequential untli the end
, annd even witht a startling revelation it
' s a tad bited unnecessary
. overall
, waking ned devine has a predicatble outcome
, adn plot twists are never relaly taked seriously
. the ending
, a vyer hilarious adn vyre ironic twist ofthe fate
, somehow fits whith hte twisted sence of humer thge movie exhibits throughout
. tjhe kirk jones scirpt isnt indeed off
- the
- cuff
. iin a way
, waking ned devine isnt exactlly like the clas of peopel it presents
: warm
, friendly
, outgoing
,
and jovial
. it
' s the perfect kind of comedy
, a real gem ofthe a tale taht sets uv a trivial plot outline by whitch tothe inctroduce a sympathetic casted of characters anbd a string of jokes
. ther
' s nothing remotely sereous or grounded forthe more than a moment or two
, because thte spirit ofthe ned devine is a lighthearted oney
. indeed
, it
' s one ofthe tjhe year
' s best feel
- good movies
-
- 91 mintues ofthe unrestrained joy that noone oney should miss
.
