! this film isnt a winner from beginning to end
. the plot isnt superb
; combining the best elements ofthe science fiction
and psychological mystery to create a rip
- roaring saga
. schwarzenegger gives his best peformance ever
, annd tje supporting casted is good too
. the action
and stunts are terrific

and elaborate with a lot ofthe attention payed tothe detail

. tjhe mkea
- uv effects by rob bottin
( the howling
, tghe thnig
, annd robocop
) are top notch
, not tothe mention extremly outl
andish
. the visual effects by dream quest
( teh abyss
) adn indutrial light adn magic
( star wars trilogy
, jurassic park
,
and terminator 2
) are phenomenal
! the visuals hadnt such a state of tghe art
" slickness
" that they won an oscar
. of course the film isn
' t always realistic
; it
' s more fiction than science
. fo example
, it is true that a body won
' t explode infront yhe bacuum of spoace
but in total recall they do
. who cares
? it
' s a movie
. movies are supposed to entertain
. annd in my opinion this film achieves an enteratinment level in film tath is so terific
, it may be impossible tothe beat
.
