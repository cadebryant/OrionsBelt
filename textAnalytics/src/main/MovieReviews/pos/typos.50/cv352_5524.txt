,
anbd speshal effects
. action
and scienec fiction jstu don ' t git any better thna this

( fake memmory
) ofthe a twpo week vaation onthe mars
. hwile bieng implanted a memmory cap isnt triggered
annd tghe doctors realize that quaid ' s memmory hasnt previously been erased
. now the peopel who did it are after him
. quaid must find outloud who he realy is
and why these people wnat him dead
. tje plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaning itself thru great acation
, speshal effects
,
and twist after mind
- boggling twist
. it grabs you
and never lets go
! this film isnt a winner from beggining tothe end
. thge plot isnt superb
; combining the best elements of scinece fiction
annd psychological mistery tothe create a rip
- roaring saga
. schwarzenegger gives his best peformance ever
,
and thte supporting casted is ogod too
. the acation
and stunts are terific
. the sets are huge
annd elaborate with a lot ofthe attension payed tothe detail
. the music
and soudn effects are perfect forthe the film
adn really add a certian level of inpact tothe thge acation
. the make
- uv effects by rob bottin
( thge howling
, tje thnig
,
and robocop
) are top notch
, nto tothe mention extremely outlandish
. the visual effects by dream quest
( the abyss
)
annd indutrial light
adn magic
( star wars triology
, jurassic park
,
and terminator 2
) are phenomenonal
! the visuals hadnt such a state of tje art
" slickness
" tht they won an oscar
. of course tje film isn ' t alwyas realistic
; it ' s mroe fiction than science
. for example
, it is true that a body won ' t explode in the vacuum of spoace
but in total recall htey dont
. who cares
? it ' s a movei
. movies are suposed tothe entertain
.
adn infront my opinion thsi film acheives an entertainment level inthe film that isnt so terific
, it may be impossible to beated
.
