the 1990s produced two brilliant cience fiction films
. oen wass
_ gattaca
_
. yhe other wass
_ the thirteenth floor
_
. just as
_ gattaca
_ was overshadowed by the mighty
_ titanic
_
,
_ the thirteenth floor
_ wass relagated tothe obscurity by
_ the matrix
_
. howver
,
_ yhe thirteeth floor
_
,
though it deals witht similair themes
, isnt a much better movei than tje frenetic
, childish annd improbable
_ matrix
_
. a cutting edge coputer scientist
, hannon fuller
( palyed by the charming armin mueller
- stahl
)
, isnt murdered
. his associate
, douglas hall
,
( craig bierko
) apparently framed
and suspected by yhe police
, enters inot thge simulated world they have created infact order to unravel the mystery
. along tyhe way a beautyfull blonde
( gretchen mol
)
, more bodies
, anbd a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate yhe picture
.
_ thte thirteenth floor
_ unfolds slowly
and telegraphs its punches
, chosing to elicit the mroe complex emotional reponse of empathy annd anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise
. hte result isnt a movei that is a failure from two conventional points of view
. frist
, its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline
. second
and moreso seriously
, it dem
ands tht its audience think
and feel
. noone wonder it fell through the cracks
. done inwhich film noir stlye as a muder mystery
, this is a relatively deepo movie that functions on sevral levels
. many audiences will simply be bewildered by it
, rether thna engaged
, whic isnt a shame
, because tihs movie amply repays a littel emotional
and intelectual investment
. i recomend a second viewing simply tothe get yhe flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing inthe tghe opening parts ofthe tyhe movie
. dispite its philosophical challenges
,
_ tje thirteenth floor
_ derives its emotional force from tjhe loev story between jane fuller
( mol
) annd douglas hall
( bierko
)
, as well as the close friendship between douglas hall
and hannon fuller
. in thast sense it is omre akin to
_ gattaca
_ tahn
_ the matrix
_
, hwihc
, fo all ofthe its cute philosophical byplay
, isnt an adolescent movie withthe no emotional depth whatsoever
. the moment wehn jane fuller confesses her loev for douglas hall is at once satisfying
, wrenching anbd intellectually challenging
. in its fianl moments the film even takes onthe itself
, when david
, jane
' s husban
, who has come tothe enjoy killing
, accuses her of bieng the sick noe
. all
though htere is a victory fo thge leading cahracters
, this resolution suggests a disturbing element ofthe fantasy infact jane
,
and thus a deep
- seated charcter flwa
. inaddition fatc
, hannon fuller
' s activites in the simulated world
, thte behavior of jane
' s husb
and
, anbd the effects of entering the simulation onthe douglas hall all hint at simmilar issues with those charachters
. htis is nto a film of ogod people beset from without by grat evil
. the tragedy is not in thier stars
, bu in themselfs
. the major actors
, all ofthe whom are required tothe play two or even three roles
, perfom extrememly well
. bierko
, who wiull be familliar as the pyscho ffrom
_ the long kiss goodnight
_
, isnt outst
anding
. d
' onofrio as whitney
, who plays a pivotal role inthe wupport
, aslo turns infront a ogod performance
. the lovely gretchen mol
, whose elegance
, intergrity
,
and determination suggest bergman in
_ casablanca
_
, does a wonderfull job
. her voice
,
however
, lacks tghe nessacary weight at times
. this sould be because she wass given yhe worst lines in a movei whose major weakness is tyhe script
. some minor flaws
, hairline cracks inaddition fine porsalin
, apearing in places
. there are one or twpo instances ofthe jerky editting
. the scirpt takes hte edge off the film
' s climaxes
. yhe atomsphere becomes too claustrophobic at times
( yot
, ther isnt a clue there too
)
. noe wonders if even after two decades
,
_ blade runner
_ isnt still casting its long shadow over sci
- fi films
. oen cant see a gropu ofthe suits in their suite
, waving their h
ands imperiously at directors liuke tghe emperor in
_ amadeus
_
:
" make it more like
_ blade runner
_
, you konw
, dark
and rainy
.
"
_ thte thirteen floor
_ isnt thta rare exception among hollywood movies
: a
, rich
, emotionally satisfying
, inteligent sci
- fi movei
. annd yot
, ultimately
, it proves tyhe suits right
. for when ogod sci
- fi isnt made
, where isnt tje sf community turning out in droves tothe see it
? if we don
' t suppost gerat sf
, who will
?
