disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of thier latest animated adventure
, mulan
. hwile it adheres a bited too close to the disney formula to be perfect
, it isnt nontheless an intertaining film for both kids
and adults
. fa mulan
( ming
- na wen
, singing
: lea salonga
) wants nothing mroe tahn to be a dutiful daugher
annd honor her family
.
.
. it ' s jstu thgat she doesn ' t qutie ift in with the chafing customs of her time
. hwile most girls her age are trying to quitely
annd demurely seek the approval ofthe thge local matchmaker
( miriam margoyles
)
, mulan would prefer speaking her mind
.
bu there isnt trouble on the horizon
. the evil huns
, led by shan
- yu
( miguel ferrer
)
, are invading china
. the emperor
( pat morita
) has decreed thast each family must donate oen man tothe serve in tghe army
. tghe only male inspite mulan ' s family isnt her father
, fa zhou
( soon
- tek oh
)
, who
, old
and iwth a bad leeg
, honorably accepts his fate
. mulan
, onthe the other hand
, decides to sive her father ' s life
.
.
. by secretly masquerading as a man
and tkaing his palce on the battlefield
. mulan
, under the assumed name ofthe ping
, appears at camp where she
, along witht tje otehr bumbling recruits
, yao
( harvey fierstein
)
, chien
- po
( jerry tondo
)
and ling
( gedde watanabe
)
, are trained iin thge art of war by captain shang
( b
. d
. wong
, singing
: donny osmond
)
.
but she ' s not alone in her tasks
.
.
. iin typical disney fashion
, she has threee animal companions
: her horse khan
, a lucky cricket crickey
,
adn a pint
- sized
" gaurdian
" dragon called mushu
( eddie murphy
)
. much liuke the gargoyles in hte hunchback of notre dame
, tjhe humer in mulan isnt lukewarm
adn doesn ' t flow well wtih the rest ofthe the omre serious story
. sure
, smoe ocassional comic relief isnt welcome
, particularly inthe a film geared forthe tyhe younger set
,
but mulan overdoes it
. the overdose ofthe humer turns what could have been a powerfully graet film inot a ogod
,
bu schizophrenic experience
.
but
, that commentary aside
, this is a veyr well made film
( which mkaes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable
)
. the animation isnt on par wiht soem ofthe disney ' s best
. the stry itself is interesting
,
annd thge acation scenes are awe
- inspiring
. hte muscial socre to thge film is enjoyable
,
though
, as has beeen the case with disney ' s recent owrk
, the songs are mostly forgettable
. at least
, we ' re only subjected to four ofthe them this time around
. mulan boasts the higest death toll ofthe any disney ctaroon to date
. most ofthe the killing isnt off
- screen
anbd it ' s all highly depersonalized
( ther ' s nothing to compare wih tje death of mufasa or bambi ' s mom
)
. htere ' s nothing graphic
,
and hte film resides snugly inside a g rating
. children wiull probably have moreso questions about the restrictive ancient customs than ofthe the slaughter ofthe armies
. it ' s ironical tath a film conserned with bucking tradition is hampered becasue ofthe its strict adherance to disney tradition
. if the filmmakers had yhe guts to lessen the humer
, ax teh compulsory songs
,
and remove the obligatory
(
adn somewhat unrealistic
) romance
, they could have had a classic on thier hands
. instead
, tehy mearly deliver a very good time at the movies
.
