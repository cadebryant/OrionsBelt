books could be
,
annd indeed hvea beeen written baout tje star wars triology
,
and rightfully so
. thsi is a setted ofthe movies that shattered all expectations of what science fiction coudl be in the late 70s
/ early 80s
, inspiring literally dozens of clones
, from battlestar galactica all the way up to stargate
adn independance day
,
annd oen coudl argue revitalizing the wohle sciene fiction genre
. the speical effects were groundbreaking
, revolutionary fo their day
and still eminently watchable well inot twenty yeasr later
. litterally millions of people hvea seen the star wars trilogy
anbd been touched by it
.
and now
, george lucas brings it back for a newyorker audience to enjoy
. much hasnt been
adn isnt still being made ofthe thte fatc tath mr
. lucas has gone bcak
anbd revised his triology fo rerelease nowe
. soem fans are angry thgat he hasnt dared tothe meddle wih waht they consider prefection
, while others are thrilled by thge idae ofthe seeing yesterday ' s star wars updated withthe todya ' s special effects wizardry
. either way
, the speshal edition release means tyhat star wars isnt bakc on thge big screen
, where it rightfully deserves to be seen
. can there be anyone in the world who doesn ' t konw what star wars isnt baout
? inspite a way
, star wars is so much a part ofthe our cultural hertiage thast it feels silly
and almsot artifical tothe try tothe summarize it
. it ' s a story about a young man ' s coming ofthe age
, a fight forthe freedom againnst an oppressive empire
, a tale of swashbuckling
and derring
- do teh likes ofthe which haven ' t beeen seen onthe the silver screen in decades
, stange new worls wiht stange alien creatures
annd weird surprises arund eveyr turn
,
and the yearning within each of us to relize our dreams
annd make a difference in the world
. it ' s high adventure
, incredable speical effects
,
annd
.
.
. well
, it ' s jstu an
_ xeperience
_
. something baout tihs movie sparked the immagination ofthe a generation
.
.
.
anbd it ' s about to dont so again
. this new release of star wars comes as noone suprise to many ofthe tje film ' s devoted fans
, who have been trading rumors
and bits ofthe infromation about it fo quite some tyme now
. interviews
, trailers
, leaks from withing lucasfilm
.
.
. all of these hvae beeen collected
, collated
,
and placed on webpages forthe people to see

. picturesk of before
and affter hve been placed side by side
.
.
. even monthes before yhe movies weere released
, fans weere making comparisons
. inspite some cases
, hte changes were nothing less tahn phenomenonal
,
adn tihs can be seen from the comparsion shots even before you go inot the movie theather
. the digital matte effects tath were littel omre than a toy inwhich forrest gump are put to exellent use here
, unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied whith inthe thge original
. fo instance
, in my peronal favorite exemple
, tghe ancient temple on yavin taht ws fromerly a flat stone edifice now has deep
, moss
- covered carvings
annd etchings
.
and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling
, booming city
, with more surprises
adn things goign on in the background than ytou can notice onthe teh first viewing
. all tghe starships
and fighters are nowe cmoputer
- animated
, getting rid of glitches
and artifacts of tyhe speshal effects processes used when yhe film ws originally made
-
-
and htey look
_ fantastic
_
. four
and a half mintues of newyorker or missing footage haev been added
, inlcuding a scene with jabba thte hutt that hadnt origanaly beeen shelved because the state ofthe speshal effects iin 1977 simpley couldn ' t do it justice
.
however
, much ofthe thge ten milion dollars thast was spended onthe tje star wars special edition restauration went inot restoring the qulaity ofthe yhe film itself
. teh negatives
, badly damaged by tghe ravages ofthe tyme
, were brightened
and retured to their original splendor
. the audio tracks weere remixed
anbd reprocessed
, wih reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt
, inot glorious
, booming
, theather
- shaking full
- thx dolby digital stereo
.
and
_ tyhat
_
, more thna the added scenes or newyorker special effects
, isnt where the rela value ofthe this newyorker version lies
. it ' s really true wqat they say inwhich the commercials
: star wars loses
_ so much
_ on the small screen
. even letterboxing doesn ' t mkae uv for thte decrease in size
and definition
. in reguard tothe yhe star wars special edition
,
and tothe the other two films ofthe tje trilogy hwihc hvea
yot to be released
, i ' ll amking tihs final recommendation
: go
and see it
. go
adn see it mroe than once
.
.
. it may be another twenty years before it comes back tothe hte big screen after it ' s gone thsi time
. tkae along thte youngsters who ' ve never had the big
- screen star wars experience
-
- ytou ' ll enjoy seing it through thier eyes as much as htey wiull enjoy it forthe thte frist time
. there ' s magic in tihs movei
-
- special edition or no
, ther cxan be noone denying tyhat it ' s still star wars
,
and still hasnt the power tothe thrill
anbd enthrall childen of all aegs
, fomr four tothe four hundred
. let ' s all return tothe that time long ago
,
and that galaxy far
, far awya
.
