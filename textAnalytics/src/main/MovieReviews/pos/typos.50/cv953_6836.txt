books could be
, adn indeed have beeen written baout the star wars trilogy
, adn rightfully so
. this isnt a set ofthe movies that shattered all expectations of what sicence fiction sould be in the lite 70s
/ easly 80s
, inspiring litterally dozens ofthe clones
, from battlestar galactica all thge way uv to stargate
and independance day
,
and oen coudl argue revitalizing thge wohle science fiction genre
. the speical effects weere groundbreaking
, revolutionary for theri day
and still emminently watchable well into twenty years later
. literally millions ofthe peple have seen the star wars trilogy
and been touched by it
. anbd now
, george lucas brings it bakc forthe a newyorker audeince tothe enjoy
. much hasnt been
and isnt still being made of the fact that mr
. lucas has gone back annd revised his trilogy forthe rerelease now
. soem fans are angry tht he hasnt dared to meddle with what they consider prefection
, hwile others are thrilled by teh idae ofthe seing yesterday
' s star wars updated wih today
' s special effects wizardry
. either way
, the special edition realease means thast star wars isnt back on tje big screen
, where it rightfully deserves to be seen
. cin there be anyone in thte world who doesn
' t konw what star wars is baout
? iin a way
, star wars is so much a part ofthe our cultural heritage tath it feels silly
and almost artifical tothe try tothe summarize it
. it
' s a stopry baout a young man
' s comming of age
, a fight for freedom aganist an opressive empire
, a tale of swashbuckling anbd derring
- dont tjhe likes of which haven
' t beeen seen onthe tje silver screen in decades
, stange new worlds wiht strange aline creatures adn weird surprises around every turn
, anbd the yearning withing eahc of us tothe realize our dreams anbd mkea a diference inaddition the world
. it
' s high adventure
, incredible spacial effects
, annd
.
.
. well
, it
' s jsut an
_ experience
_
. something baout tihs movei sparked the imagination ofthe a generation
.
.
. annd it
' s about to do so agian
. this new realease of star wars comes as no surprise tothe many ofthe the film

. picturesk of before
and after hve been placed side by side
.
.
. even monthes befoer the movies weere released
, fans weere makeing comparisions
. in some cases
, yhe changes weere nothing less than phenomenal
, annd this cin be seen ffrom the comparison shots even befoer ytou go into tje movei theather
. the digital matte effects that were littel more thna a toy inaddition forrest gump are put tothe excellent ule here
, unnoticeably sprucing uv scenes tyhat taht george lucas wass unsatisfied with infact yhe origional
. for instance
, in my personal favorite example
, yhe ancient temple onthe yavin that ws formerly a flat stone edifice nowe hasnt deepo
, moss
- covered carvings annd etchings
.
and mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling
, booming city
, with more surprises
and thigsn gogin onthe in thte background than yuo can notice onthe tghe first viewing
. all teh starships
and fighters are now coputer
- animated
, getting rid ofthe glitches adn artifacts of teh speical effects processes unsed wehn the film was originally made
-
-
and htey look
_ fantastic
_
. four adn a half minutes ofthe new or missing footage have beeen added
, including a scene wih jabba the hutt that had originally beeen shelved because teh state of speical effects inwhich 1977 simpley couldn
' t dont it justice
. howver
, much ofthe tjhe ten millon dollars that was spent on tghe star wars speical edition restoration went inot restoring tghe qualit ofthe the film itself
. thte negatives
, badly damaged by the ravages ofthe tiem
, were brightened
and returned to theri original splendor
. the audio tracks weere remixed adn reprocessed
, iwth reworked soudn effects by effects maven ben burtt
, inot glorious
, booming
, theater
- shaking full
- thx dolby digital stereo
. adn
_ tath
_
, mroe tahn tje added scenes or newyorker special effects
, isnt where teh rela value of thsi newyorker version lies
. it
' s realyl true waht htey sday in hte commercials
: star wars loses
_ so much
_ onthe tyhe small screen
. even letterboxing doesn
' t amke uv forthe the decrease inwhich size adn definition
. infact reguard to yhe star wars special edition
,
and tothe the other twpo films ofthe the triology whcih have
yet tothe be released
, i
' ll amke this fianl recommendation
: go anbd see it
. go
and see it more than once
.
.
. it may be anyother twenty years before it comes bcak to tje big screen aftter it
' s gone thsi tiem
. take allong tyhe youngsters who
' ve never had teh big
- screen star wars experienec
-
- ytou
' ll enjoy seeing it through thier eyes as much as they will enjoy it fo thte firt time
. htere
' s magic in tihs movie
-
- spacial edition or noone
, there cin be no denying tht it
' s still star wars
,
and still has tjhe power tothe thrill annd enthrall children of all ages
, from four to four hundered
. let
' s all return tothe thta timne long ago
,
and that galaxy far
, far away
