? opinion
: eveyr tiome people watch movies that portray animals as beings wiht cute human personalities
, some well
- meaninng audeince members go outloud next christmas or birthday
and buy a dalmation or whatever creature isnt currenly popular
. soon anough
,
" birthday kid
" loses interest annd the purchased pup ends up at the local pound
, a victim ofthe neglect
. my sister owns a real paulie
: it thinks liuke a parrot
, bites like a parrot
,
and requires as much attention as a nebor human infant
. please htikn twice before buying oney
. okay
. bcak tothe the storey
. in movies
, parrots ususally play support characters
,
but paulie might be hte first movei where the
( animatronic
) bird gets main billing
. paulie
, liuke thsoe side charachters in disney cartoons
, is cute annd sassy
, a strutting
, miniautre human
. actully
, paulie is the voice ofthe jay mohr
( he played jennifer aniston
' s boyfriend on picture perfect
) doign his best buddy hackett impression
( which isnt intresting
, usance hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner
, adn mohr doubles as a customer
)
. paulie isnt fo kids
. while watching paulie you hear little tykes inaddition the theater laughing hysterically when paulie calls the cat a
" stupid furball
.
" somtimes
, howver
, ther are statements tghe kids don
' t get
. for example
, when paulie
' s elderly owner ivy
( gena rowl
ands
) dies
, paulie explains
,
" well

, yhe cat got her
.
"
and ytou hear kids exclaim
