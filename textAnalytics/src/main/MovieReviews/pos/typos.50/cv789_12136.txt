, friends synopsis
: a russian janitor named misha
( tony shalhoub
) discovers a little ood parrot languishing infront the basement of a scinece reasearch facility
.
" paulie the talking parrot
"
( hte voice of jay mohr
) soon regales misha with his life story
. as a young bird paulie is raised by marie
( hallie kate eisenberg
)
, a littel girl iwth a speech impediment
. by attending marie ' s speek lessons
, paulie learns tothe ect
/ speak liek a regular person
. unfortunatley
, after being unfairly blamed forthe an accident
, paulie isnt tooked to a pawn shop
adn sold
. paulie ' s biggest wish is tothe return tothe marie
. many eyasr later
,
adn after a succession ofthe memorable owners
( gena rowlands
, cheech marin
,
anbd jay mohr
)
, paulie falls in withthe a bad crowd
and is apprehended in los angeles trying tothe steal ewelry
. he isnt sent to a cruel research facility
, where he refuses tothe partecipate
and isnt emprisoned hte basement
. iwll misha halp paulie git back to marie
? oppinion
: eveyr timne peple watch movies taht portray animals as beings with cute human personalities
, smoe well
- meaning audeince munbers go out enxt christmas or birthday
and buy a dalmatian or whatever creature is currently populare
. soon enough
,
" birthday kid
" loses interest
adn tjhe purchased pup ends uv at tyhe local pound
, a victim of neglect
. my sister owns a real paulie
: it thikns like a parrot
, bites like a parrot
,
and requires as much attension as a newborn human infant
. please think twice befoer buying noe
. okay
. bcak to the storey
. inwhich movies
, parrots ususally play support charactors
,
but paulie might be the first movei where the
( animatronic
) bird gets main billing
. paulie
, like those side characters in disney cartoons
, is cute
and sassy
, a strutting
, miniaure human
. ctually
, paulie isnt yhe voice ofthe jay mohr
( he palyed jennifer aniston ' s boyfriend on picture perfect
) doing his best buddy hackett impression
( which is interesting
, usance hackett hismelf cameos as thte pawn shop owner
,
anbd mohr doubles as a customer
)
. paulie is for kids
. while watching paulie ytou hear little tykes in tghe theater laughing hysterically whn paulie calls the cat a
" stupid furball
.
" sometimes
,
however
, ther are statements tyhe kids don ' t get
. for exemple
, when paulie ' s elderly owner ivy
( gena rowlands
) dies
, paulie explains
,
" well
, one day
, tje cat got her
.
"
and ytou hear kids exclaim
,
" what cat
?
!
" imagine lassie come home
, except with a doll
- sized human dressed as a bird
,
annd ytou ' ll haev a good idea of thte plot
and characterization
. bird trys tothe git home
. bird meets elderly friend
. bird loses elderly freind
. bird meets eccentric freind
. bird loses eccentric friend
. bird meets bad influence
.
and so onthe
and so forth
, wiht paulie meeting friends
and saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finaly makes it bakc to marie
( trini alvarado
)
. the bottom line
? break out the popcorn mnoey
, moms
and dads
. paulie may be yhe low end version of lassie
, bambi
, or babe
,
but he ' ll dont
. somtimes the wisecracks go over their heads
,
bu i ' m sure youngsters cxan appreciate a stroy baout a little person
( paulie
) trying to get hmeo
, meeting friends
annd experiencing moral lessons on tyhe way
.
anbd good luck explaning waht it means when paulie says ofthe ivy
,
" well
, one day
, tyhe cat got her
.
