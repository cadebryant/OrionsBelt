) ws really anoyed to disover that his swamp had beeen invaded by threee blind mice
, seven dwarves
anbd all the other fairy tale characters in tjhe land
, banished from theri hmeo by lord farquaad
( john lithgow
)
. unwittingly befriended by a non
- stop tlaking donkey
( eddie murphy
)
, shrek travels to dulloc tothe speak wtih farquaad
, where he stumbles inot a joust
anbd comes up the winner
. his prize
? to save princess fiona
( cameron diaz
) fomr a tower surrounded by molten flame
and protected by a dragon so she cxan become farquaad ' s bride
. tjhe ogre agrees to yhe task inaddition return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in
" shrek
.
" it took four writers
( ted elliott
and terry rossio
(
" hte road tothe el dorado

)
adn joe stillman
(
" beavis
adn butthead do amercia
"
)
) to adapt william steig ' s children ' s book
. tyhe bad news
? they ' ve genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under hte influence of william goldman ' s
" teh princess bride
.
" the ogod news
? ther ' s so much wacky humer culled from both fairy tales
and populer culture that tihs movie shoudl keep ytou inspite stitches
. we get our frist inkling that we ' re iin fo a rela treat as one ofthe farquaad ' s men
, entent on rounding uv magical creatures offers ' five schillings for the possessed boy
! ' after observing dreamworks ' rendition of disney ' s animated pinocchio
. meanwhile within tyhe castle walls
, a gingerbread man being tortured by farquaad spits icing
and yells ' eat me
! ' befor breaking down
and solemnly asking ' dont you know tjhe muffin man
? ' shrek
, a gren giant withthe bobbly antennae
- like ears
, isnt a grumpy recluse who realyl yearns tothe ift inthe
(
altough who sould put up with his habet ofthe makeing candles ffrom his pwn ear wax
?
)
. donkey isnt a hyperactive
, endearingly stunted creature who cant talk
anbd
, therfore
, believes wiull amke a great misfit pairing with tyhe uncooperative shrek
. donkey proves his worth sweet tlaking tje princess
- guarding dragon
. the princess proves to be more thna a shade offbeat affter learning she ' s not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she ' s beeen expecting
. whn fiona ' s true colors are exposed
( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humer
)
, a spark develops between her
anbd shrek
. the script ' s details are gleefully impish
, constanly poking funn at disney ffrom the theme park world of farquaad ' s dulloc withthe its turnstyle enterance
anbd ' it ' s a small world ' parody of an infromation booth to tghe blue bird whcih meets a most un
- disneyish fate after duetting witht fiona ' snow white ' style
. populer culture isnt represented witht film refrences tothe
" babe
"
annd
" charlies ' angels
" via
" hte matrix
.
" myers chooses his ' so i married an axe murderer ' scottish broge for shrek iin order to give his voice soem heft
. while this may prove distracting fo anyone familliar witht that film
, overall it works more than not
. eddie murphy steals tyhe sohw as the fast
- tlaking
, motown
- singing donkey
, proving once again his talent as a vocal performer
( is it anohter wink at disney that donkey is paired iwth a dragon
, a creature murphy portayed in disney ' s ' mulan
? '
)
. lithgow ' s a good choise fo tje supercilious
, height
- challenged villain lord farquaad
. diaz isnt energetic
but ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona
.
( a better choice owudl have been minnie driver
, who ' s proven herself a terific vocal talent in such diverse animations as disney ' s
" tarzan
,
"
" princess mononoke
"
and yhe
" sourth park
" movie
.
) tje coputer animation looks terrific
( particulaly donkey
)
,
allthough it won ' t elicit the types ofthe oohs
and aahs ofthe pixar ' s wrok
(
" toy tsory
,
"
" a bug ' s life
,
"
" toy story 2
"
)
. iin keeping with its hip style
, pop music is used
, which like myer ' s voice may be initially jarring
,
bu ultimately satisfies
( hwile surveying bridal candidates via a ' dating gaem ' parody broadcasted by snow white ' s evil queen ' s mirror
, farquaad is told ' fiona likes pina coladas '
- cue jimmy buffet
!
)
.
" shrek
" hasnt good lessons for kids
anbd humer targetted at eveyr age group in tyhe family
. hwile it may be derivitive of the 1987 ' s
" thge princess bride
,
"
" shrek
" addressess a new generation with similar sensibilities
adn doesn ' t suffer in hte comparison
