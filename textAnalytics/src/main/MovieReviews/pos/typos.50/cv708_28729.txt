al
though who could put up witht his habit of making c

)
. donkey isnt a hyperactive
, endearingly stunted creature who can talk
and
, therfore
, believes iwll make a great misfit pairing withthe teh uncooperative shrek
. donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess
- guarding dragon
. the princess proves tothe be more tahn a shade offbeat affter learning she
' s not getting tyhe fairy tale issue rescure she
' s been expecting
. whn fiona
' s true colors are exposed
( including opportunies forthe soem tomboyish gross out humer
)
, a spark develops between her adn shrek
. the scirpt
' s details are gleefully impish
, constantly poking fun at disney ffrom thte theme park world ofthe farquaad

" myers choosed his
' so i married an axe murderer
' scottish brogue forthe shrek in order to give his voice some heft
. hwile htis may prove distracting fo anyone familliar wtih that film
, overall it works moreso tahn nto
. eddie murphy steals the sohw as tyhe fast
- tlaking
, motown
- singing donkey
, proving once agian his talent as a vocal performer
( is it anohter wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon
, a creature murphy portrayed infront disney

' mulan
?
'
)
. lithgow
' s a good choice fo the supercilious
, height
- challenged villain lord farquaad
. diaz is energetic bu ultimatly nondescript voicing princess fiona
.
( a better choise would haev been minnie driver
, who
' s proven herself a terific vocal talent in such diversed animations as disney
' s
" tarzan
,
"
" princess mononoke
"
and tjhe
" south park
" movei
.
) the cmoputer animation looks terific
( particularly donkey
)
, altho it won
' t elicit tje types ofthe oohs annd aahs ofthe pixar

(
" toy story
,
"
" a bug

,
"
" toy sotry 2
"
)
. inspite keeping wiht its hip stlye
, pop music is used
, whitch liuke myer
' s voice may be initally jarring
,
but ultimatly satisfies
( while surveying bridal c
andidates via a
' dating game
' parody broadcast by snow white
' s evil queen

, farquaad is told
' fiona likes pina coladas
