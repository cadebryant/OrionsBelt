capsule
: trippy
, hyperspeed acation machine from hong kong
' s accomplished tsui hark
. van damme annd rodman ahev nice chemistry
, the stunts are eyepopping
, adn stuff gets blowed up rela ogod
; wqat more do ytou wnat
? i admitt i wass all setted to loathe doulbe team
; it reeked ofthe cheapjack timing
- orientated marketing
( stick dennis rodman inwhich a movei
, quick
, hwile he
' s hot
,
and do something about jean
- claude van damme
' s flagging carreer while we
' re at it
!
)
. suprize
-
- double team transcends its dumb roots
and turns out to be a mess ofthe fun
. bring some friends
, git some pretzels
,
and haev a blast
. van damme isnt jack quinn
, an ex
- agent who isnt brought bakc infact for
" one last mission
"
-
- you
' d htikn any spy worth his shoe phone woudl run like hell when he hears those words
. bu van damme
' s character hasnt a pregnant wief who
' s also a sculptor
,
and some unpleasant presure gets utilisied tothe get him to come through onthe htis mission
. he
' s beeen assigned to tkae down an ood enemy
, a territorist named stavros
( mickey rourke
, looking oddly subdued
)
, who may be back up tothe his old tricks
. in the first showdown betweeen quinn
and stavros
, tjhe movei wears its ambitions proudly onthe its sleeve
: nonstop action
. an amusement park
, a hospital
, a private
" retired spy
"
' s retreat
, most of rome
, various houses
, planes
, cars anbd other modes ofthe tranport
,
and the coliseum
(
!
) all become arenas forthe some of the most bone
- rattling shoot
- outs
and punch
- outs filmed
. they are better seen than described
and are reason anough tothe see the film
: oney jaw
- dropping scene hasnt van damme tkaing onthe a man who uses a switchblade with his
* feet
*
.
( van damme is a good
, dextrous athlete
and fighter
,
but he isnt often upstaged
.
) htere are otehr nice touches
. stavros
and quinn both want tje smae thing
: tothe retire inspite peace with theri families
. that ambition ties them together infact varous ways
,
and aslo humanizes them a bited
. noe of the things about hk acation movies is tath there
' s always some form of human element
,
and that
' s carried over inot this movei as well
. it gives weight to scenes that owudl otherwise be forgettable
. allso good isnt dennis rodman
, playing a weapons dealer named yaz
-
- a character who sticks outloud like a fistful ofthe broken fingers annd who is funny jstu st
anding there
. rodman is natural onthe screen
; he
' s funn tothe watch
, especially when slinging bad guys liuke basketballs
, annd deserves to get a movei ofthe his own
, based onthe whta
' s seen here
: a lightweight
, fast
- moving entertainment tyhat showcases all ofthe its pieces excellently
.
