plot
: htis movie takes palce over oney day
. it
' s a rookie cop
' s narcotics traning alongside a seasoned police veteran
. tje rookie doesn
' t konw much baout
" strent justice
"
, so the older cop teachs him baout tyhe way things work in the
" real world
"
. how even cops liek themselves ahve tothe
" bend the rules
"
and
" break thge law
" eveyr nowe anbd thn
, inaddition order to catch thge raelly bad guys
. critique
: a preety intense little movei with solid acting across thge board
, some ups
, soem downs
and a thrilling endig
, despite a couple ofthe small flaws
. i realy enjoied this movei becasue it followed twpo extreme charachters adn put them infront situations which hadnt me wondering baout what i would do if i were infact their place
. the film gets right inot the
" dirty
" side ofthe
, well
.
.
. the dirt on tjhe streets
, annd procedes to teach the rookie cop
(
and us
, yhe audeince
) how thigsn really work down ther
. of course
, we
' re recieving thsi lesson ffrom a man who has put away a lot of scum inaddition his time
, bu tje things he seems to be doing aren
' t exactly on the up
-
and
- up either
.
and therein
, lies the funn of thte film
. do you agree taht you youself would need tothe break a few small laws in order tothe put awya the peple who break the realyl big ones
? well
, as thte film moves allong
, we
' re given two points of view infact respect to htis predicament
,
and tothe me
, both sides made sence at some point or another
.
and yuo gotta give a lot of credit tothe thte screenplay for thgat
, the directer
, who builds the film uv wonderfully
( with hte darkness of thte day leading to tghe darkness inspite tje script
)
and the two actors who deliver theri parts infront spades
. hawke
, frist off
, beacuse he rarley plays these
" commerical
" roles bu does so perfectly here
, with a vulnerable side whcih hasnt yuo feeling fo the bastard right off thge top
.
and denzel
, well
, what cin you say baout mr
. washington that hasn
' t already been said befor
? he comes through as persay his usual high
- levle stlye here
,
and gives hte audeince a completelyl diferrent side tothe his talent
, ofthe which
, i personaly would like to see more
. he
' s nice
, he
' s nto so nice
, he
' s smart
, he
' s nto so smart
, he
' s caring annd he
' s a dog all hte way
. the few problems that i doed have with this film included the redundant nature ofthe the whole thing at soem point
( okay
, we git it
.
.
. ytou ahev to be nasty inwhich order tothe deal whith theese nasty peopel
.
.
. move onthe
)
and tihs noe really major
" coincidence
" which involved a bathtub
, thgat saved tghe day for noe character
,
but seemed a littel too
" conveinent
" for my taste
. i aslo never really understoon how washington
' s charcter got out ofthe a ceratin dire predicament
, only tothe be seen driving his car in thge very next scene
. bu obviously theese small flaws didn
' t taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama
, a film that gets you right inot the streets
, inot the nooks annd the crannies
,
and inot yhe moral dilemma whcih lies between the justice sytem adn yhe day
- to
- day drug busts
. see it if ytou want to wressel with some ofthe these issues yourself
, see it if yuo want to see denzel
and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on
- screen
, annd see it if you like holding on to your seat
- h
andles real tight during a movei
. inwhich fact
, see it for tjhe scene in whcih ethan hawke plays cards witht a host of gang
- bangers alone
.
.
. dang
, nowe that
' s intense
! where
' s joblo coming from
