"

" rela world
"
. how even cops liek themselves have tothe
" bend teh rules
"
adn
" break tyhe lew
" eveyr nowe
annd
thne
, inwhich order to catch the realy bad guys
. critique
: a pretty intense littel movei with solid acting accros the board
, soem ups
, smoe downs
adn a thrilling endig
, dispite a cuple ofthe small flaws
. i really enjoyed this movie because it followed twpo extreme characters
and put them in situations hwihc hadnt me wondering about what i would do if i were in thier place
. the film gets right into the
" dirty
" side of
, well
.
.
. tje dirt onthe teh streets
,
and proceeds to teach yhe rookie cop
(
and us
, the audeince
) how thigsn really work down htere
. of course
, we ' re receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his tyme
,
bu the things he seems to be doign aren ' t exactly onthe hte uv
-
and
- up eather
.
and therein
, lies the funn ofthe thge film
. do ytou agree that ytou yourself woudl need tothe break a few small laws inwhich order to put awya yhe peple who break tyhe realy big ones
? well
, as the film moves along
, we ' re given two points ofthe view infact respect to this predicament
,
and tothe me
, both sides made sence at soem point or anohter
.
anbd ytou gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for taht
, the director
, who builds tyhe film up wonderfully
( with the darkness of thge day leading tothe the darkness in the scirpt
)
adn the two actors who deliver their parts inspite spades
. hawke
, firt off
, becouse he rarley plays theese
" commerical
" roles
but doesnt so perfectly here
, with a vulnerable side hwihc hasnt yuo feeling fo tjhe bastard right off the top
.
adn denzel
, well
, what cxan you say about mr
. washington that hasn ' t aready been said before
? he comes thru as persay his usual high
- level sytle here
,
and gives the audience a completely diferent side tothe his talent
, ofthe whcih
, i personally would like tothe see more
. he ' s nice
, he ' s not so nice
, he ' s smart
, he ' s nto so smart
, he ' s carring
adn he ' s a dog all the way
. the fewd problems thta i doed hvea with this film included the redundent nature of teh whole hting at some point
( okay
, we get it
.
.
. yuo have tothe be nasty infront order to deal wtih theese nasty people
.
.
. move on
)
and tihs noe relaly major
" coincidence
" whihc involved a bathtub
, thyat saved the day for one character
,
bu seemed a littel too
" convinient
" for my taste
. i also never realy understoon how washington ' s charater got out of a certian dire predicament
, only to be seen driving his car in thge vrey enxt scene
.
bu obviously these small flaws didn ' t taint my overall enjoyment ofthe thsi tense drama
, a film thyat gets ytou right into teh streets
, inot the nooks
and thte crannies
,
and into the moral dilemma whihc lies vetween thte justice sytem
and thge day
- to
- day drug busts
. see it if you watn tothe wrestle with some ofthe theese issues yourself
, see it if yuo want to see denzel
adn ethan strike up a palpable chemistry onthe
- screen
,
annd see it if you liuke holding on tothe your seat
- handles rela tight durring a movei
. inthe fact
, see it fo tyhe scene inspite whlch ethan hawke plays cards with a host ofthe gang
- bangers alone
.
.
. dang
, nowe that ' s intense
! where ' s joblo coming ffrom
