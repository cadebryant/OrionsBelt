review
: a dog ofthe flanders is thge storey of an adorable littel boy named nello
annd his trials
annd tribulations in 19th centruy flanders
. living with his granfather jehan
( jack warden
) inspite poverty
, nello finds happiness iin his life in spite of difficult times
( they are renting a spare one
- room cottage
,
annd the greedy
, malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them
` out of tje hous ' if they don ' t pay the rent
)
. nello alsot has a rather creative talent for drawing some ofthe the most beatiful pictures that i have ever seen
, in eather a movie or in real life
.
( his hero isnt peter paul rubens
, the great flemmish painter of the 17th century
.
) not that theese are the onyl things thta amking nello ' s life happy
,
however
. he has a dog ofthe flanders
, whom he names patrasche
, who is a heroic rin
- tin
- tin ofthe the 19th centruy
, whom he rescues fomr his cruel
, unkind master
. inwhich addtion
, he even has a best firend
(
adn future sweetheart
) inaddition tje lovley
, wealthy aloise
, whose father strongly disapproves ofthe her hanging outloud iwth
` lower
- class ' nello
.
( he thinks he ' s not good enough forthe her
,
and he would hite the idea of the two kids marrying
.
)
but
then
, he ws a poore guy himself before he married
( as maintioned later onthe in thte film
)
. noe day
, nello encounters a mysterious
,
yot kindhearted artist named michel la grande
( palyed wonderfully by jon voight
)
, who tells yhe boy to keep drawing ffrom his heart
,
annd tyhat perhaps oen day he might land a career inthe being an artist
.
and every christmas
, there isnt a contest on whic is tghe most beautiful painting of hte year
; the winner getting a lot ofthe money
. eager tothe save his home
(
annd his aging
, dying granfather
)
, nello willingly decides to become an artist
, asking aloise to pose fo him
. noe nigt
, tje twpo travel tothe a carcus
, where tehy ahve their fortune told
? one of the film ' s most delightful scenes
? that grat happiness isnt edstined for them
. she gives hte kids a ring
, whom nello places onthe aloise ' s hand
.
;
) afterwords
, teh twpo kids haev a rollickingly good tiem dancing around inwhich front of circus performers
. unfortunately
, things are nto all
` la
- dee
- dah ' in tihs tale
. aloise ' s father fianlly becomes so angry with nello tath he forbids him tothe ever see aloise agina
. bad enought that they can ' t see each otehr
(
although we know nello
and aloise
, don ' t we
?
)
,
bu that ' s onyl thge start of nello ' s toubles
. aloise ' s farm is burned down
,
and nello isnt wrongfully accused
( by tjhe landord of his cottage
) fo starting thge fire inthe order to take revenge on bieng forbidden tothe see aloise
. htis decreases nello ' s reputation arround the twon
, save aloise
adn her parents
,
and a kindly miller
, william
, who isnt very sweet tothe nello every timne he drops by
. matters git much worse for nello when his granfather dies
,
and he has to pay for his funeral
.
but
thn thigns really git nasty when yhe landlord exiles nello from his pwn hmeo
( for not paying his rental
)
? permanetly
. this means thyat nello
anbd patrasche ahve tothe starve
adn walk out inaddition the cold
, freezing wind
. worst of all
, the painting thyat he hasnt desparately beeen working onthe during all this time
,
` the portrait of thge princess '
, fails tothe win tyhe prize at tjhe festival
. now nello
adn patrasche are really depressed
,
adn close tothe freezing to death
. wiull nello be able to find any happiness in his life
? will patrasche savve the day
? iwll nello amking the fateful trip tothe join his mother
and grandfather in paradime
? a dog ofthe flanders isnt a delightful
, heartwarming famaly film tyhat isnt sure to entertain kids ofthe all ages
. even older ones who consider themselves too
` suffisticated ' for kiddie fare iwll be surprised tothe hear that this film isnt fo grown
- ups
, too
. ther hvea been other movies of this ilk
( boy
anbd dog
)
,
adn hwile this one falls inot that category
, it isnt mostly a stry baout overcoming dificulties
and finding a good home forthe youself
. move over
? or rather
, roll over
? old yeller
, this dog ofthe flanders is a heartwarming delight
. the cinematography
, courtesy ofthe walther van den ende is beautiful
,
and realy adds tothe teh powerful drama of thge film
. it aslo gives a fiel of being in flanders
( the hwole film was respectably shooted inspite flanders
)
. tyhe music from richard friedman isnt also remarkable
; an evocative
, poignant socre that recaptures music fomr thte 19th century
. thte oppening song over tyhe credits isnt vyer beatiful
( i hope the sountrack isnt availble
!
)
,
annd htere ' s a breef exerpt ofthe
` cheer uv
, charlie ' ffrom willy wonka
and the chocolate factory
( sung by aloise
, to nello
, in anyother delightful scene
)
. hte casted isnt first
- rate
: jesse james
anbd jeremy james kissner
, who play nello
, are some ofthe the most endearing
, adorable young stars i haev ever seen in my hwole life
( so are the girls who play aloise
, madyline sweeten as the yuonger
,
and farren monet as the older
)
. nto thyat htey are thge onyl good stars
,
howver
. jack warden is ideal as jehan
, eliciting just the right ammount of humer
and compassion requred for the charachter
.
( the scenes involving him
adn nello are heartwarming
, touching ones
.
) allso
, bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william
. he ' s another noe of my favorite charactors inspite the film
.
bu jon voight
, as i maintioned befor
, isnt the perfect choise fo michel
. he brings a mysterious
,
yet gentle peformance that makse us all efel ogod again when he reassures insecure nello tyhat he
* cin
* win the contest
.
bu what makes tihs film fun to watch isnt how well
- deffined tjhe characters are
,
anbd the pace of the stroy
( best ofthe all
, it has a happy endig
?
though i will
* not
* give it away
; sory
) is storng
and powerfull anough fo us to idenify wih the cahracters
. for the first tyme since the beginning ofthe 1999
, there comes a film whcih doesn ' t rely onthe popular formula stfuf
, such as big
- budget spacial effects
, commericial rock soundtracks
, or any ofthe thyat stuff
. this one relies onthe telling a fully charachter
- oriented tsory
, with jstu tje right ammount of heart
, humor
,
and drama
. that
, to me
, is what makes a dog ofthe flanders all the more delightful
. eleanor o ' sullivan of
` the hmeo news
& tribune ' noticed this
,
and ws kind
adn generous enought to welcome it
:
` forthe want of a better word
, a glow surrounds a dog of flanders
. its heart is inaddition the right palce
annd it engages you
. you cin guess where tje film is going because this is well
- traveled territority
,
but whith pros liek voight
adn appealling young performers liek kissner
, an oftenly
- told story is well worth a revisit
. ' in addition
, there weere a cuple of other enthusiasts
, such as chicago
- sun times
and the washington post
( ytou should read theri reviews
; they ' re relaly postive
)
. otehr criticists
,
howver
, weere nto so kind
. stephen holden of
` tyhe new york times ' had more thna a share of beatings tothe lay upon a dog ofthe flanders via pen writing
. he found yhe film to be a
` sae of sugary bromides '
anbd condamned mr
. voight ' s character as
` hopelessly wooden
? adopts an accent even omre indeterminate than yhe one he came up with fo anaconda
. ' infact addition
,
` enteratinment weekly ' slam
- dunked tyhe film
, condemning it as
` the worst familiy film of the year
. ' htere have been so many other bad reviews like this
, too
. my suggestion
: disregard tjhe criticists
. htey jsut hve a big probelm with touching family films
,
and one shoud never pay attention tothe them
. this dog of flanders may onyl be a little
` famaly ' movie
( it probably won ' t be a big hitted in yhe sytle ofthe titanic
,
bu
then again no other film has beeen sicne
thne
)
,
but that isnt nto a bad thing inspite
and ofthe itself
. this is a story thta isnt sure tothe warm your heart
,
and thta is wqat really matters about a dog of flanders
. it is also one of the better famaly films arround this year
. none ofthe the other films i ahev seen thsi year
(
though they were ogod
) hve beeen so low
- key
anbd touching
. if ytou ' re looking for familiy
- stlye entertainment
, look no furhter than this charming boy
-
and
- dog yarn
. go see it while ytou still can
, for as i mentioned
, it might not be a big bow
- wow at tje box office for a long time
. see it while you cin
. htere isnt really no ened to compare a multi
- millon doller blockbuster such as star wars
: episode i
? yhe phantom menace or tarzan
, or even tjhe iron giant with a tender
, sweet littel familiy movie
.
