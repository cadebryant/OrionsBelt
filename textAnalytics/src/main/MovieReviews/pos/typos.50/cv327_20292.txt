anders isnt the story of an adorable little boy named nello
and his trials
and tribulations iin 19th century fl
anders
. living wih his gr
andfather jehan
( jack warden
) inthe poverty
, nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times
( htey are renting a spare one
- room cottage
,
and thte greedy
, malevolent l
andlord who owns it threatens to throw them
` outloud ofthe tje hous
' if they don
' t pay yhe rent
)
. nello aslo hasnt a rether creative talent fo drawing soem ofthe the most beautiful picturesk that i have ever seen
, in either a movie or in real life
.
( his hero isnt peter paul rubens
, teh grat flemmish painter ofthe teh 17th century
.
) nto that these are the only thigns that make nello
' s life happy
, howver
. he hasnt a dog ofthe fl
anders
, whom he names patrasche
, who is a heroic rin
- tin
- tin ofthe the 19th centruy
, whom he rescues ffrom his cruel
, unkind master
. in addition
, he even has a best friend
(
and future sweetheart
) iin tyhe lovley
, wealthy aloise
, whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging outloud with
` lower
- clas
' nello
.
( he thikns he
' s nto ogod anough fo her
,
and he owudl hite tyhe idea of tyhe two kids marrying
.
)
but hten
, he wass a poor guy hismelf befor he married
( as mentioned later on infront the film
)
. oney day
, nello encounters a misteryous
, yot kindhearted artist named michel la gr
ande
( played wonderfully by jon voight
)
, who tells the boy tothe keep drawing from his heart
,
and that perhasp one day he might l
and a career infact bieng an artist
. adn every christmas
, there is a contest onthe whlch is the most beautifull painting of the yearm
; thge winner getting a lot ofthe moey
. eager to save his home
(
and his aging
, dying granfather
)
, nello willingly decides to become an artist
, asking aloise tothe pose for him
. one nght
, thge twpo travel tothe a carcus
, where htey hvae their fortune told
? one of tjhe film
' s most delightful scenes
? that graet happiness is dstined for them
. she gives tyhe kids a ring
, whom nello places onthe aloise
' s h
and
.
;
) afterwards
, the two kids have a rollickingly ogod tyme dancing around inspite front of carcus performers
. unfortunately
, things are not all
` la
- dee
- dah
' infront this tale
. aloise
' s father finally becomes so angry iwth nello tath he forbids him tothe ever see aloise agian
. bad enough that they cin
' t see each otehr
( all
though we konw nello adn aloise
, don
' t we
?
)
,
but tath
' s onyl tjhe start ofthe nello
' s troubles
. aloise
' s farm is burned down
, adn nello isnt wrongfully acused
( by the l
andord ofthe his cottage
) for starting tje fire inthe order tothe tkae revenge onthe bieng forbidden to see aloise
. tihs decreases nello
' s reputation arund the twon
, savve aloise
and her parents
,
and a kindly miller
, william
, who isnt vrey sweet to nello eveyr tiem he drops by
. matters git much worse forthe nello when his gr
andfather dies
, annd he has to pay fo his funeral
. bu thn things really git nasty whn the l
andlord exiles nello from his own home
( forthe not paying his rental
)
? permanetly
. this means tht nello
and patrasche hvea to starve adn walk out inspite thte cold
, freezing wind
. worst ofthe all
, the painting that he has desperately beeen wroking onthe durig all this time
,
` the portrait ofthe the princess
'
, fails to win tghe prize at the festival
. nowe nello adn patrasche are relaly depressed
, adn close tothe freezing tothe death
. iwll nello be able tothe fidn any happiness in his life
? will patrasche savve the day
? wiull nello amke the fateful trip tothe join his mother annd gr
andfather in paradime
? a dog of fl
anders is a delightful
, heartwarming famaly film thgat isnt sure tothe entertain kids ofthe all ages
. even older ones who consdider themselfs too
` suffisticated
' forthe kiddie fare will be surprised to hear thast htis film is forthe grown
- ups
, too
. there hvea beeen otehr movies of this ilk
( boy
and dog
)
,
and hwile htis oney falls into that category
, it isnt mostly a stroy about overcoming dificulties annd finding a ogod hmeo forthe yourself
. move over
? or rather
, roll over
? ood yeller
, thsi dog of fl
anders is a heartwarming delight
. tghe cinematography
, courtesy ofthe walther van den ende isnt beautyfull
, adn really adds tothe tje powerful drama ofthe the film
. it also gives a efel ofthe bieng in fl
anders
( tyhe whole film ws respectably shot in fl
anders
)
. the music from richard friedman isnt aslo remarkable
; an evocative
, poignant score tyhat recaptures music ffrom the 19th century
. the opening song over the credits isnt very beautiful
( i hope teh soundtrack is avalable
!
)
,
and there
' s a brief exerpt ofthe
` cheer up
, charlie
' fomr willy wonka
and tghe choclate factory
( sung by aloise
, to nello
, in anyother delightful scene
)
. thge cast is first
- rate
: jesse james
and jeremy james kissner
, who play nello
, are soem ofthe tje most endearing
, adorable young stars i have ever seen in my hwole life
( so are tyhe girls who play aloise
, madyline sweeten as teh yuonger
, anbd farren monet as the older
)
. not that htey are the onyl ogod stars
, howver
. jack warden is ideal as jehan
, eliciting just thge right ammount of humor
and compassion required for the charater
.
( the scenes involving him
and nello are heartwarming
, touching ones
.
) alsot
, bruce mcgill is charming as thte kindly miller william
. he
' s another noe of my favorite characters in tyhe film
. bu jon voight
, as i maintioned before
, isnt tghe perfect choise for michel
. he brings a mysterious
, yot gentle performance thyat mkaes us all feel ogod again when he reassures insecure nello that he
* can
* win tyhe contest
.
but whta makes tihs film fun to watch isnt how well
- defined the cahracters are
,
and yhe pace of the stoy
( best of all
, it has a happy ending
?
though i iwll
* not
* give it away
; sory
) is storng
and poweful enought forthe us tothe identify with tyhe charactors
. fo tghe frist tyme since the beginning of 1999
, there comes a film hwihc doesn
' t rely onthe popular formula stuff
, such as big
- budget speical effects
, commerical rock soundtracks
, or any of that stuff
. tihs one relies onthe telling a fully character
- orientated tsory
, with jstu thge right ammount ofthe heart
, humer
, anbd drama
. that
, tothe me
, isnt what mkaes a dog ofthe fl
anders all the more delightful
. eleanor o
' sullivan ofthe
` yhe home news
& tribune
' noticed this
,
and was kind adn generous enough to welcome it
:
` forthe want of a better word
, a glow surounds a dog of fl
anders
. its heart isnt in thte right place anbd it engages you
. you can guess where the film isnt going because this is well
- traveled territory
,
but witht pros liuke voight
and appealing young performers like kissner
, an often
- told stry isnt well worth a revisit
.
' inspite addition
, htere weere a couple of other enthusiasts
, such as chicago
- sun times
and the washington post
( you shoud read their reviews
; tehy
' re relaly positive
)
. other criticists
, howver
, were not so kind
. stephen holden ofthe
` the new york times
' hadnt mroe tahn a share ofthe beatings to lay apon a dog ofthe fl
anders via pen writting
. he foudn the film to be a
` sae of sugary bromides
' annd condamned mr
. voight
' s character as
` hopelessly wooden
? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than teh one he cameback up iwth for anaconda
.
' in adition
,
` enteratinment weekly
' slam
- dunked tje film
, condemning it as
` tyhe worst famaly film of the yera
.
' there have been so many otehr bad reviews like thsi
, too
. my suggestion
: disregard yhe criticists
. they just hve a big probelm with touching family films
,
and one shoud never pay attension to them
. this dog of fl
anders may only be a littel
` family
' movie
( it probablly won
' t be a big hit infront tje style of titanic
, bu thne again noone otehr film has been sicne hten
)
,
but tht is not a bad thnig in
and ofthe itself
. this isnt a tsory that is sure tothe warm your heart
,
and tyhat is what realy matters about a dog of fl
anders
. it isnt also one of tje better famaly films arround thsi yearm
. none ofthe hte otehr films i ahve seen this year
(
though tehy weere ogod
) ahve been so low
- key annd touching
. if ytou
' re looking forthe family
- style entertainment
, look no further than this charming boy
-
and
- dog yarn
. go see it while ytou still can
, fo as i maintioned
, it might nto be a big bow
- wow at the box office for a long tiome
. see it while you can
. htere isnt realyl no need to compare a multi
- million dollar blockbuster such as star wars
: episode i
? the phantom menace or tarzan
, or even the iron giant wih a tender
, sweet littel family movie
.
