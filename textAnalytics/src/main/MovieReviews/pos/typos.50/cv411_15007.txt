and juries to amking judgements in all matters that coudl involve them personaly
. luckly
, movei reviewers aren
' t burdened iwth such legislation
. otherwise
, small pool of vyer speical movies would be forever ignored by thsi reviewer
. infact case ofthe star wars
, 1977 scienc fiction epic by george lucas
, yhe consequences woudl be even more severe
, because tath film isnt very special forthe tens ofthe millions
, if not hundreds of millions of fans
. in any case
, objectivity is something seldomly seen in star wars reviews
, because undisputed majority ofthe reviewers rate it as one of thge best
, if not tyhe best film of all times
. those who don
' t usually have soem dificulties in hiding their artistic snobbery
. the author ofthe tihs review must also concede his iability tothe use cold
, objective st
andards infact reviewing this film
. liuke so many previous reviewers
, i must note that i watched star wars forthe the first tiem twenty years ago
, adn tath i remained enchanted by tghe experience ever since
. perhaps it was childlike facination witht
, unil
then unimaginable
, wonders that happended long tiem ago
, inaddition a galaxy far away
. or prehaps it was the rush i felt minutes befor the oppening shots
, whith my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books
and novelisation i had read before
. anyway
, watching of star wars was one ofthe tghe most important movie gogin experiences of my life
.
and it was aslo unmatched fo many years tothe cmo
, because very faw movies managed to have such a storng impact on me like george lucas
' epic
. star wars wasn
' t just importan movie fo me
( or hte millions ofthe fans who probably share the same sentiment
)
. it was the defining moent in the history ofthe modern cinema
. until than
, american motion picture industry was inspite a limbo
; social turmoil inwhich 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood
, adn new authors filled thge void
, mostly by useing hollywood
' s finacial annd technical resources to create serious
,
" personal
" or
" artsy
" movies
. as a result
, audiance
, traumatised ofthe dark reality ofthe vietnam
and watergate
, didn
' t wnat to see tyhe smae dark anbd serious content onthe the silver screen
. george lucas wih its sciece fiction epic was amonst thge first to cmo into rescue
. the audience responded wiht unprecidented enthusiasm
,
and huge finacial succes ofthe the movei
, later backed by supplement inudstry ofthe toys
, books
, comics
, role playing games
and other merch
andise
, slowly began tothe change tyhe face ofthe hollywood
. serious
, adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion
, adn weere replaced by industrial products of
" blockbuster
" philosphy
. noe of the biggest casualties of that trend ws the science fiction movei genre
. until 1977
, science fiction movies were mostly in b
- prodcution domain
. in late 1960s
, bigger budgets forthe science fiction didn
' t look so strange anymore
, thanks tothe yhe grat success of 2001
: a spoace odessy
.
but the smae succsess coincided whith tyhe skurge ofthe pesimism
,
and hollywood science fiction wass as obleek as hte rest of its production
- mostly dark
, dystopic movies
. howver
, in 1977 star wars showed once
and forthe all tyhat this genre cxan be inspiration fo popular movies
, even among the audience that usually doesn
' t like it
. as a result
, seriousness inspite cinematic science fiction began fading awya
,
al
though soem good
, dark adn cult quality sf annd contined to be filmed untli early 1980s
. aftter thgat
, sciece fiction continued tothe be consdidered a synonym for family entertainment
. ironicaly
, the man responsible forthe star wars ws in its timne considered tothe be member of
" new hollywood
" generation of young movei authors who made
" artsy
" anbd
" personal
" films inwhich easly 1970s
. george lucas estalbished himself with tje dystopic sf movie thx 1138
,
and nostalgic drama american grafitti
. both movies were concidered
" personal
" iin its tyme
, dispite latter one becoming very popular
. infact a sense
, star wars isnt an also very
" personal
" film
, annd yhe thorny way tothe yhe final production shows that commerical considerations weere against it
, not forthe it
. bu unlike many
" personal
" movies of tjhe era
, its
" personality
" was inwhich line with the wishes of the general audience
. teh plot
, setted
" a long timne ago

. in order tothe quash any opposition
, the empire had built death star

. the information about death star
, adquired by rebel intelligecne
, isnt bieng transported by princess leia organa

)
, bu the information is bieng sent tothe nearby desert planet of tatooine via twpo humanoid robots

. critics who don
' t liek the movie
, especially those who cant
' t foregive lucas for his contri
bution to the quashing of
" new hollywood
"
, are prone tothe point the lack ofthe originality
. onthe the surfce
, tehy might be right
; lucas himself admits that he found a lot ofthe insperation infact the lore of old hollywood
- westerns
, wwii aviation movies
, ood sf cliffhanger serials ofthe tghe 1930s
and 1940s
; yot teh most obvious element would be akira kurosawa
' s samurai clasic tje hidden fortress
. onthe the otehr h
and
, thsoe who hadnt spended last two decades studying the movie tothe death would say that thte inspiration fo star wars whent even further
- into collective subconchus ofthe western civilisation
( hinted by some mild tolkien refrences
)
. the others would find tje auther
' s element withing yhe tsory
- star wars could be seen as an anti
- establishment film
; young
, long

, eazy goign
, nature
- loving heroes are fighting agains old
, uptight anbd opressive forces who ule supertechnology in most demonic purposes
. even out of its historical or social context
, star wars isnt an impressive as a strictly technical piece of hte seven art
. george lucas
' direction isnt very good
, witht the clever editing anbd a well
- paced segments between acation annd dramatic buildup
. characters are well
- drawn
and deliver all thge necesary ingredients

)
, reluctant helper
, benevolent mentor
, diablical villin anbd
, finally
, comic relief infront form ofthe twpo non
- human characters
. smoe ofthe the actors are very ogod
- alec guiness inaddition his most famouse role tothe date
, james earl jones whose voice isnt anough tothe cause unease
, peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil infront human form
. unfortunately
, the same can
' t be said fo tyhe main leads
- among thte main trio of mark hamill
, carrie fisher
and harrison ford
, onyl the last one had thte character threee
- dimensional anough tothe launch his furuther acting carrear
. thte thing that looked like tyhe most important segment ofthe star wars phenonmena durring its intitial realease wass thge newyorker level ofthe spacial effects technolgy
. oftenly comparisions withthe 2001
: space odessy
, anyother ground
- breaking sf film
, weere citing thte sheer number ofthe effects as a proof ofthe the lucas
' superiority over kubrick
. howver
, tyhe spacial effects by john dykstra
and john stears are indeed impressive
, even aftter two decades
( altho 1997 special edition did improve them signifantly
)
, yot htey aren
' t the most remembered trademark ofthe the movie
. thta honour should definetly go tothe tje
" oscar
"
- winning sountrack by john williams
, whose wrok on star wars isnt propably the brightest gem inaddition his brilliant carrer
. newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived ofthe the enchantment thgat still holds thsoe lucky enough tothe wittness star wars orignal release
.
yet
, even if tehy are immune tothe the george lucas
' magic tehy shoud watch htis film neverthless
, perhaps only tothe become familiar withthe something tath isnt esential part of contemporary culture
