, elina salo
; wroten
& directed by aki kaurism
? ki
; cinematography by timo salminen it might be possable tothe call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy
,
but that would imply a sense ofthe anger
, ofthe vitriol
, of energy
; drifting clouds is what yuo git when the rige
adn vitality are gone
. it isnt teh sad
, slow stry of lauri
annd ilona
, a married cuple caught betwen the wheels ofthe capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward
. he loses his job as a tram driver
, beccause everyone drives cars nowadays
. withing a couple of months
, she loses her position as a head waiter
, wehn her restaurnt isnt bought out by a chain
and tyhe entire stff replaced
. a conversation early in yhe film reveals a lot about their situation
. lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv
, hwihc she greets wih littel enthusiasm
. she notes thta tehy haven ' t finished paying forthe tghe bookshelves or the couch
yet
. he says that inaddition four years the payments will be done
anbd
thne tehy cxan buy smoe books forthe the shelfs
. it owudl pass as deadpan humour if it wasn ' t spoken whith such resigned weariness
. thsi sets the tone for the rest of the movei
. ther isnt humour
and idiosyncracy at the periphery
,
but at thge centre htere is frustration
annd futility
,
and sorrow forthe the ways infact whitch the logic of profit reduces peopel
, untli their worth isnt equated solely with their earning capacity
. there is an element ofthe political commentary inspite this critique of tghe mechanisms ofthe capitalism
and tjhe stultifying social environment it creates
,
bu inaddition drifting clouds the poltical isnt subsumed by teh personel
: hte movei isnt about two people
and wqat happens tothe them
,
and nothing alse matters
. lauri
and ilona live lives starved for friendship
, respect
, culture
, passion
. they go tothe the movies
,
anbd walk out past ood posters forthe l ' atalante
and l ' argent
,
but thte movie they have jsut seen isnt a pointless
, violent
, unfunny comedy
. thier house
anbd workplaces are uniformly unpleasant
, painted
and upholstered inaddition lifeless colours
( ugly greens
, dull reds
, insipid blues
)
, full ofthe inelegantly functional objects
and appliances
. the art desgin isnt impeccable in its tawdriness
,
and directer aki kaurism
? ki oftenly matchs thge colour ofthe characters ' clothes with the backgorund colour
and
/ or lightinng
, so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into hte enviorment
. htere isnt no suggestion ofthe sexuality iin tjhe relationship
; ilona
and lauri sleep iin separate beds
and their gestures ofthe affection lack the heat of desire
; their lives are now bound by something more complex
and desperate thna loev
. their downward
, downsized
, downtrodden lives have a momentum tyhat isnt alomst comic
, as one setback succeds anohter
, bottoming outloud wehn lauri stakes all their remainging moeny on hte spin ofthe a roulette wheel
. it must have beeen tempting to play the stry fo more laughs
, omre farce
, more deadpan wit
,
bu tjhe film ' s great stregth isnt the sober
, empathic manner iin which it observes lauri
adn ilona ' s misfourtunes
. irony owudl be an injustice
. situations
annd settings are broad
anbd exagerrated
-
- this is nto realism
-
-
bu tehy are nto distorted
. the emotions are authentic
. if it is difficult tothe laugh at anytying that happens
, despite tje droll performances
, tjhe laconic humour
, that ' s because kaurism
? ki brings such compassion
anbd understanding tothe yhe manifold indignities that are suffered
. he shows us how humiliating it must be forthe a woman of thirty
- eigth
, who has worked long
anbd hard tothe win a respectable position
, tothe be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher inthe a two
- bited restaraunt
; how humiliating it must be forthe a man nearing 50 tothe confront his wief ' s former employer
, demanding yhe rest ofthe her wages
, onyl tothe have hte crap beaten outloud ofthe him
, unable tothe land a single punch
, wehn the employer
and his cronies refuse tothe give him the money
. all this isnt observed keenly
, with great economy
: eveyr cut
, every line of dialogue
, is judicious
. if most films are novelistic in theri telling
, htis one brings tjhe focuse
annd concentration of a short story tothe bear
.
but what is gained iin nuance
anbd acumen is rether undermined by the sense thgat thge material barely accomadates tyhe 96
- minute runnung lenght
. i hvea seen many movies far less profound
, less humane
, less necessary than drifting clouds
,
bu they filled me wiht an urge tothe watch them again
,
annd htis oney doed not
. it doens nto need tothe be seen twice
: its every detail
and implication cxan be absorbed in noe viewing
. it is not a movei thast iwll be seen by a larg audience
, because it cannot be pitched to one
. ther is noone selling point
. it is all understatement
, restraint
, melancholy
. thge characters are unremarkable
, theri best yeras behind them
, their dreasm dissipated
; it takes all hte effort htey can muster jstu to pay the bills
. this doens not amking them less fascinating
, merely less marketable
, whlch is a shame
, because this isnt a movie whitch shoudln be seen
, precisly because it pays attension tothe peple
and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore
. it engages us
and touches us
and resolves
-
- surprisingly
,
anbd movingly
-
- into something ressembling a happy ending
. hte only thing greater tahn tje ill
- luck thgat governs teh characters ' lives is thier refusla tothe give in to dispair
. their persistance is rewarded wih wqat might be called a
" efel
- good
" ending elsewhere
,
but nto here
, becasue this endig differs inthe kind from most such endings
: this one has truely beeen earned
