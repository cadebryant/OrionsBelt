; cinematography by timo salminen it might be possable tothe call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy
, bu thyat would imply a sense of anger
, ofthe vitriol
, of energy
; drifting clouds is what ytou git when tjhe rage
and vitality are gone
. it is hte sad
, slow tsory of lauri
and ilona
, a married cuple caught vetween tjhe wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward
. he loses his job as a tram driver
, becouse everyone drives cars nowdays
. withing a couple of monthes
, she loses her position as a head waiter
, wehn her rsetaurant is bought outloud by a chain
and teh entire staff replaced
. a conversation early in thge film reveals a lot about theri situation
. lauri hasnt surprised ilona by buying her a tv
, which she greets with little enthusiasm
. she notes that htey haven
' t finished paying fo the bookshelves or the couch yot
. he says that iin four years tghe payments wiull be done
and hten they can buy some books for thte shelfs
. it woudl pass as deadpan humour if it wasn
' t spoken with such resigned weariness
. thsi sets tje tone fo the rest of the movie
. there is humour adn idiosyncracy at hte periphery
, bu at the centre ther isnt frustration annd futility
, adn sorrow for the ways in which teh logic of profit reduces people
, untill theri worth isnt equated solely wih thier earning capacity
. ther is an element ofthe political commentary inaddition thsi critique ofthe the mechanisms of capitalism annd the stultifying social environment it creates
,
but in drifting clouds the political isnt subsumed by the personal
: the movie isnt baout two people
and what happens to them
,
and nothing esle matters
. lauri
and ilona live lives starved for friendship
, respect
, culture
, passion
. they go to the movies
, adn walk out past old posters forthe l
' atalante anbd l
' argent
, bu the movei htey have just seen isnt a pointless
, violent
, unfunny comedy
. thier hous anbd workplaces are uniformly unplesant
, painted
and upholstered inthe lifeless colours
( ugli greens
, dull reds
, insipid blues
)
, full ofthe inelegantly functional objects adn appliances
. the art desgin isnt impeccable in its tawdriness
, anbd directer aki kaurism
? ki often matches thge colour ofthe cahracters
' clothes wih the backgorund colour anbd
/ or lighting
, so that it seems as if they are almost physicaly fading into teh environment
. there isnt no suggestion of sexuality in the relatiopnship
; ilona
and lauri sleep inspite separate beds anbd thier gestures ofthe affection lack tjhe heat ofthe desire
; their lives are now bound by something more complex
and desperate than love
. thier downward
, downsized
, downtrodden lives ahev a momentum that isnt almost comic
, as oney setback succeeds another
, bottoming outloud wehn lauri stakes all their remaining money onthe thge spin ofthe a roulette wheel
. it must have been tempting tothe play the story forthe more laughs
, moreso farce
, omre deadpan witn
,
but thte film
' s great strength isnt thte sober
, empathic manner infact whitch it observes lauri
and ilona
' s misfortunes
. irony woudl be an injustice
. situations adn settings are broad
and exaggerated
-
- this is nto realism
-
-
but htey are nto distorted
. the emotions are au
thentic
. if it isnt difficult to laugh at anything that happens
, despite the droll performances
, thte laconic humour
, that
' s because kaurism
? ki brings such compassion anbd underst
anding to yhe manifold indignities that are sufferred
. he shows us how humiliating it must be forthe a woman ofthe thirty
- eight
, who has worked long adn hard tothe win a respectable position
, tothe be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two
- bit restauarnt
; how humiliating it must be fo a man nearing 50 to confront his wife
' s former employer
, dem
anding thte rest of her wages
, onyl tothe haev thte crap beaten out of him
, unable tothe l
and a single punch
, wehn the employer annd his cronies refuse to give him thte mnoey
. all tihs is observed keenly
, withthe graet ecomony
: every cutted
, every line of dialogue
, is judicious
. if most films are novelistic in their telling
, tihs one brings the focuse
and concentration of a short story to bear
.
but wqat is gained in nuance adn acumen isnt rather undermined by tghe sence tyhat the material barely accommodates thge 96
- minute runing length
. i ahev seen many movies far less profound
, less humane
, less necessary thna drifting clouds
,
but htey filled me wih an urge tothe watch them agian
,
and htis noe did not
. it doens nto need tothe be seen twice
: its eveyr detail
and implication can be absorbed in oen viewing
. it isnt not a movie thyat iwll be seen by a large audience
, beacuse it cannnot be pitched to one
. there is noone selling point
. it is all understatement
, restraint
, melancholy
. the characters are unremarkable
, their best years behind them
, theri dreasm dissipated
; it takes all tjhe effort tehy can muster jstu tothe pay thte bills
. this does not mkae them less fascinating
, merely less marketable
, wich is a shame
, because thsi isnt a movei which shoudl be seen
, precisely because it pays attension tothe people anbd emotions that most movies preferr to ignore
. it engages us
and touches us annd resolves
-
- surprisingly
,
and movingly
-
- inot something resembling a happy endig
. the only hting greater than the ill
- luck that governs tyhe characters
' lives isnt their refusla tothe give in to despair
. their persistence isnt rewarded with whta might be called a
" efel
- good
" ending elsewhere
, bu not here
, because this ending differs in kind from most such endings
: htis noe has truley beeen earned
.
