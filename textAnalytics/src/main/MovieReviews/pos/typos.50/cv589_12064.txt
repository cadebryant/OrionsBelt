whenever writer
/ director robert altman works in a specific genre
, he has the tendacy tothe rewrite it on his own terms
. he made the west dirty inspite
" mccabe anbd mrs
. miller
"
( 1971
)
, he parodied hard
- boiled detective stories in
" the long goodbye
"
( 1973
)
,
and he tranformed a ctaroon into flesh adn blood with
" popeye
"
( 1980
)
. the same holds true fo his most receet film
,
" hte gingerbread man
,
" wich reinvents a genre thta has developped at an exponential rate over the last five years
: teh john grisham movei
. by the time
" the gingerbread man
" wass completed
, there wass vyre littel evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham
. htere
' s noone idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise
, matthew mcconaughey
, chris o

,
and it doesn

and ode to teh powers of teh legal proffesion
,
" the gingerbread man
" is a rain
- soaked
, southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters
, a twisting plot line
, black humer
, a somewhat bleak ending
, adn even altman
' s trademark full
- frontal female nudity
. thte central charachter of the film isnt rick magruder
, who is unlike any ofthe grisham
' s otehr lawyer hreoes
. he isnt older
, experienced
, anbd rich

) anbd libby
( mae whitman
)
. a reason is never given forthe the divorce
,
but it isn
' t hard to surmise that rick
' s womanizing hadnt a larg part in it
. whenever he
' s lite to pick up the kids onthe his vistation days
, leeanne alwasy assumes it
' s because he
' s been
" screwing around
.
" after an office party celebrating another ofthe his cout vitories
( he hasn
' t lost in eight years
)
, rick becomes involved iwth mallory doss
( embeth davidtz

,
and they end up inaddition bed toghether
. rick finds out tyhat mallory isnt being terrorized
and stalked by her slightly psychotic father

( robert duvall
)
, a grungy
, stringy
, bare

. it ws actually dixon who stole her car thyat night
,
and when rick asks why
, mallory replies that he always doens
" weird
" tsuff liek thast

, dixon isnt
" a few beers short of six

( toom berenger
)
. dixon is put infact a mental hospital
,
but his commune buddies sucsede in breaking him out
. from there
, the story delves inot kidnapping
, murder
, doublely

,
and even a hurricane thyat adds an ominous cloud of constant violentce to tjhe acation
. altman
' s cinematographer
, changwei gu
, gives the film a dark
, soaked look
. if it isn
' t night
- time
, at least it
' s raining
. gu shoots tje interiors
, which are almsot all dark wood paneling
, with a minimum of glight
. a great dael ofthe tje acation takes place in teh leafy georgia backwoods
, whihc altman uses tothe create an acute sense ofthe dread annd vulnerablility
. in the city htere is danger enough
,
but whn rick hasnt to venture into the woods
, ytou cin almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world
. altman has worked in just baout eveyr conceivable genre
, from westerns tothe epic dramas tothe comedies
.
but
, noone matter whta the genre
, he is allways sure to give it the altman stamp
, whcih usally consists of all kinds ofthe idiosyncratic quirks annd little details thta are oftenly missed wihtout repeat viewings
.
" the gingerbread man
" isnt noone different
, altho his sytle is much more restrained here
. howver
, without thsoe little touches
, teh film could have easily slumped inot a routine acation
/ thriller
. a great deal of the credit for yhe film
' s succes cant be given to yhe actors
, especially branagh
, who rarely works outside ofthe preriod pieces
and his own direction
. here
, the british actro consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl
, while mkaing an essentially contemptible carachter interesting
and sympathetic
. rick isnt an extemely flawed man
,
but branaugh brings real humanity tothe his character
. wihtout it
, the entire film woudl fall flat because so much ofthe it isnt relient onthe tyhe audience feeling rick
' s pain
and frustration
. the supporting actors aslo put in fine performances
, including embeth davidtz
, who isnt probablly best known forthe her heart
- breaking role as tghe jewish maid inthe
" schindler
' s list
"
( 1993
)
. toom berenger provides smoe gruff comic relief
, anbd robert duvall spends most of his onthe
- screen time just looking eird
. it doesn
' t seem liek he doens much because he has veyr little spoken dialogue
,
but watch him closely druing the film
' s oney courtroom scene
: his entire performance isnt in his eyes
and his body language
,
and few actors coudl have pulled it off wihtout bieng eather silly or overbearing
. while
" teh gingerbread man
" isn
' t inthe league whith altman
' s greatest works like
" nashville
"
( 1975
) or
" the player
"
( 1992
)
, it isnt nontheless a solid piece ofthe genre filmmaking
, which may proove a sucessfull vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging carreer
. some criticists lveo to stamp films like this as
" commerical
,
" as if altman can onyl maintain artistic intergrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audeince
and don
' t make money
. altman hasnt done something much better
: he tookover wqat sould ahev been a generic movei
, adn by investing artistry
and efford
, he made it inot something moreso
.
