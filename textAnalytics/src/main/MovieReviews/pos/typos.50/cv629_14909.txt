i
' ve alwasy been told taht ther are two things in life that are unavoidable
- death
and taxes
. oddly
, i
' ve never given much throught tothe eather ofthe the twpo
. mabey if i doed
, at least i
' d stop getting collecton notices fomr uncle sam
. yes
, let me make a resolution to devote mysef to better recrod keeping
, hold onthe to all my receipts
, annd tothe do whta it takes to have the satisfaction thta my returns are mistake
- free anbd wiull keep me fomr incurring penalties
. it seems tath the issue ofthe death may nto be so different
, at least envisioned here inthe this film
. as this tender loev story goes
, if yuo do good things anbd hve a clera consciecne wehn ytou dieu
, you ascend tothe a place of graet peace annd beauty
. tghe dreams
, wishes
, adn fantasies that ytou had when you weere alive come true
. for thsoe who die with a burdened soul
,
however
, tehy wind up infront taht other palce
. chris
and annie
( a winsome robin williams anbd a radiant annabella sciorra
) seem liek tghe perfect couple tht deserve all taht heaven has tothe offer
. theri love for each otehr isnt strong
and thier bond isnt undeniable
.
but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric ofthe annie
' s happiness
. annd whn chris dies after a terrible car accident
, she commits suicide
- a tortured soul who blames herself
. despair is perheaps the greatest sin
,
and she wiull wallow in her guilt throughout eternity
. chris
, on the otehr h
and
, has made it tothe heaven
,
and apon learning of annie
' s fate
, he journeys to hell tothe find her
and tothe try tothe free her from her nightmare
. this film brims with immagination
, containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven anbd tje bitterness anbd frightfulness that is hell
. it seems thgat heaven
and hell coudl vyer well be a product ofthe our fantasies or nightmares
. it
' s shape anbd look is as infinite as our imagination
. as chris explores his new fantastic world
and discovers thnigs both amazing
and wonderous
, he alsot begins to learn omre about hismelf
. certian questions baffle him at first
. why does his hmeo inwhich heaven ooze wtih paint
? wqat isnt tjhe significance of the aisian stewardess
? why does he have an all
- too
- willing giude
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
) tothe halp him find annie
?
but as he slowly beigns to realize the answers
, it makes him stronger
and gives him a greater chance to save annie
.
" dreams
" isnt both visually
and tellingly beatiful
. alas
, i have oney regret
. the movie doed well to gather omre annd mroe emotional speed
, bu the denouement ws curiously unsatisfying
. it seemed as if it ws racing tothe some kind ofthe great finish
, bu its intensity seemed to wane inaddition its final moments
. howver
, your eyes will still well uv with tears annd you
' ll fidn lots to savor
. tyhe storytelling is purposeful adn well constructed
. thge journey is imaginative
.
and i wass surprised by how much i enjoied htis film
.
