i ' ve allways beeen told taht ther are twpo things in life that are unavoidable
- death
annd taxes
. oddly
, i ' ve never given much thought to eather ofthe tyhe two
. maybe if i did
, at least i ' d stpo getting collecton notices fomr uncle sam
. yes
, let me amking a resolution tothe devote myself to better rocord keeping
, hold onthe to all my receipts
,
and tothe dont what it tkaes to ahev thte satisfaction that my returns are misteek
- free
and will keep me from incurring penalties
. it seems that the issue ofthe death may not be so diferent
, at least envisioned here inwhich tihs film
. as this tender love story goes
, if you dont ogod thigns
and have a clera conscience wehn ytou dieu
, you ascend tothe a place ofthe grat peace
and beauty
. thte dreasm
, wishes
,
annd fantasies that ytou hadnt wehn you were alive come true
. forthe thsoe who die wih a burdened soul
,
howver
, tehy wind up in that other place
. chris
and annie
( a winsome robin williams
and a radiant annabella sciorra
) seem like tjhe perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has tothe offer
. their lvoe for eahc otehr isnt storng
and their bond is undeniable
.
bu tradgic events evenhtually tear aart thte fabric of annie ' s happiness
.
and when chris dies after a terrable car accident
, she commits suicide
- a tortured soul who blames herself
. dispair isnt perphas hte greatest sin
,
and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity
. chris
, on the otehr hand
, hasnt made it tothe heaven
,
and apon learning ofthe annie ' s fate
, he journies tothe hell tothe fidn her
and tothe try tothe free her from her nightmare
. thsi film brims wih imagination
, containing a lush imagery that shows tyhe arcadia that is heaven
and teh bitterness
annd frightfulness thta is hell
. it seems thta heaven
and hell coudl very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares
. it ' s shape
anbd look is as infinate as our imagination
. as chris explores his new fantastic world
annd dicovers things both amazing
and wonderous
, he also beggins tothe learn mroe baout himselv
. certain questions baffle him at first
. why doens his hmeo in heaven ooze wtih paint
? whta isnt hte significance of the aisian stewardess
? why doesnt he hvea an all
- too
- willing guide
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
) tothe help him find annie
?
bu as he slowy beigns tothe realize tyhe answers
, it mkaes him stronger
anbd gives him a greater chance to sive annie
.
" dreasm
" isnt both visually
anbd tellingly beautyfull
. alas
, i haev oney regret
. thte movie doed well tothe gather omre
and more emotional speed
,
bu tyhe denouement ws curiously unsatisfying
. it seemed as if it was racing tothe some kind ofthe great finish
,
but its intensity seemed to wane in its fianl moments
.
howver
, your eyes will still well uv withthe tears
adn yuo ' ll find lots tothe savor
. the storytelling is purposeful
anbd well constructed
. tghe journey is imaginative
.
and i was surprized by how much i enjoyed this film
.
