' s film isnt a centenial clasic
-
- watched adn re
- experienced by every generation
. wonderfull life isnt oney ofthe tghe few pictures ofthe times gone by that seems as fresh
, mabey fresher
, thn it did wehn it was first released
. many films ofthe the thirties through seventies have aged poorly
.
but this one isnt a near flawess example ofthe how well a perfect scirpt anbd timing can mesh wih firt
- rate acting
, wit adn suspense
, glorious music
,
and terrific setted peices
. tyhe onyl even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining infront which god has a long caht wih clarence
, george
' s gaurdian angal
. tehy aren
' t all tyhat bad
, bu tehy reamain corny adn a littel outloud ofthe palce
. nethertheless
, this is one film that deserves its palce inthe time
, cinema histroy
,
and our hearts
. it can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age
. here is oen genuin masterpeice
, a classic that reaches heights adn ambitions near prefection
. htis crackling ogod mixture results in a film whitch isnt at once funny
, exciting
, moving
and uplifting
. the film itself isnt almost a reveral ofthe tje life of george bailey
-
- there isn
' t too much tothe it
, bu capra
and the gang
( various screenwriters
, composers
, actors
) plumet the material to its fullest potential
. tghe result is a film
-
-
though not at frist intended tothe be pigeon
- holed as a holiday film
-
- that will allways be remembered
, celebrated
, annd loved
.
