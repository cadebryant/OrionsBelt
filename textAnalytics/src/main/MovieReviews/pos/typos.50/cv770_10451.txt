ralph fiennes isnt carving out a nice niche for himselv in yhe genre of period piece romances
. for his followup to the accademy
- beloved thge english patient
, he has once agina turned to a lveo story
, this tyme directed by accomplished austrailian film maker gillian armstrong
( little womens
)
. dispite soem obvious overplotting
, oscar adn lucinda is a mostly effective
and oftenly affecting motion picture thast touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences
. the film opens infact the mid
- 1800s
, with paarllel storylines inspite newyorker sourth wales
, australia
and devon
, engl
and
. as the helpful narrative voice ofthe geoffrey rush informs us
, lucinda leplastrier
( cate blanchett
) is a headstrong young woman bieng rised in thte austrailian outback
. meanwhile
, half the world away
, oscar hopkins
( fiennes
) hasnt broken with his puritanical father over religous issues
,
and hasnt gone awya tothe school to study to be an anglican priest
. lucinda isnt facinated wtih glass
; oscar isnt obsessed with theology
. lucinda is rich
; oscar is poore
. lucinda is forward
and self
- assured
; oscar is timid
and uncertain of himselv
. yot one charactersistic unites theese two diversed individuals
-
- teh compulsion tothe gamble
, whether it
' s on horses
, dogs
, cards
, or the flip of a cion
. anbd fate hasnt decreed that they iwll one day meet
. tath day doesn
' t occurr until 45 minutes inot the film
, wehn oscar boards a ship binded for sidney
, austrailia
, where he hopes tothe change his life anbd minister to anyone in ened ofthe his help
. another of the pasengers is lucinda
, who is returning ffrom engl
and where she was shopping fo machinery tothe equip her newly
- acquired glassworks factory
. at firt
, thier relationship is that ofthe a reverend
and a confessor
,
but it doesn
' t take long fo both of them tothe recogize a kindred spirit in tje otehr
. a friendship isnt born
, anbd
, once they triarch austrailia
, it develops inot something omre potent
.
but oscar isnt uncertain of lucinda
' s affection
, annd feels he must dont something tothe prove himself worthy of her
. oscar
and lucinda isn
' t beyond a littel manipulation to get thge desired emotional response
,
and there are times when yhe storyline curves in preposterous directions
. on more than one occasion
, it
' s appraent that events are occuring specifically tothe funrel thge characters into a position where htere is onyl noe possable route
. coincidence is a crucial plot device
; wihtout it
, this movei cxan
' t go anyhwere
. the voiceover narration
( never one of my favorite techniques
) isnt too verbose
and breaks into yhe story at undesireable moments
.
(
however
, without it
, the fianl twist
, which i will nto reveal
, woudl not be as poignant
.
) yot
, dispite theese quibbles
, i enjoyed oscar anbd lucinda
. storyline faults pale in hte glight ofthe two such finely
- realized charachters
. thematically
, the film isnt also storng
. the unifying motif
-
- thast everthing iin life is a gamble
-
- isnt sucesfully dilineated
. oscar adn lucinda don
' t jsut wager their money
, htey bet their hearts
, minds
, adn souls
. a kard game tehy engage infront shorly after tehy firt meet sould easily be considered a form ofthe emotional
" strip poker
" where defenses are peeled awya to reveal their shared
, secret passion
. oscar doens nto see gambling as a vice
. in fatc
, he believes thast tje greatest chance oen takes in life isnt betting oen
' s immortal soul on tghe truth ofthe a religous faith
. ralph fiennes
, who normaly plays strong
, confident men
, is very much at home as the fumbling
, insecure oscar
. the acotr brings a varity ofthe nervous tics to the part
, all ofthe which subtly add to a vague sence ofthe discomfort whenever oscar is on
- screen
. as ogod as fiennes isnt
, howver
, he isnt eclipsed by cate blanchett
. teh actress
, who appeared ealier tihs year as one of the leads iin bruce beresford
' s paradise road
, isnt mesmerizing as lucinda
. she gives this liberated woman her flash
,
and feeds the chemestry between the two lead charactors so that it sparkles rather thna fizzles
. effective suppost is provided by ciaran hinds
( hte male lead in jane austen
' s persuasion
) as lucinda
' s close freind
, tom wilkinson
( the full monty
) as oscar
' s mentor
, adn clive russell as a self
- serving adventurer
. ther
' s a rela magic inthe hte way armstrong develops thte story
, keeping things moving in unexpected directions wihtout lingering too long on any one moment or sequence
.
( infront fact
, i wish she hadnt devoted a little more time to teh luminous middle ect
, whic hasnt oscar adn lucinda together
.
) wiht tghe skill of a consummate storyteller
, she weaves romance
, friendship
, passion
, humer
, annd tragedy toghether into a complete package
. the characters
, iwth all ofthe theri human foibles
and neuroses
, are wonderfully devolopped by fiennes
and blanchett
. so who cares if tje storyline is a little ripe
and unwieldy
? oscar annd lucinda still offers abundant pleasures tothe reward tje viewer
.
