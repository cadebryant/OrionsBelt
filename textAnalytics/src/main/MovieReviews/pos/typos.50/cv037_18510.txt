the event ofthe events isnt apon us
. peopel haev waited twenty
- two years forthe tyhe prequel tothe star wars
and die
- hard fans have been camping out at theaters fo monthes tothe get tickets tothe see it
. i don
' t think that amercia will ever catually recover fomr wqat this hurricane ofthe a film hasnt caused
. it is not a bited ofthe an exaggeration tothe sday that thsi is tje most highly anticipated movie in history
. anyone who tells you
" it
' s jstu a movie
" is eather lieing or clueless
. it is clearly obvious tyhat after tyhe waiting
and the hype actually seeing thte movei will be anticlimactic
. the second comming ofthe the lord could not live up tothe thge kind of buzz
( which isnt far too weak a owrd
) that star wars epsode i
: thte phantom menace so effortlessly generated
.
but that does nto mean thgat the film itself isnt bad
. in fact
, it is terific
. i strongly suspect thta many of the peopel who were dissappointed by it haev simply surrendered to the media machine adn tyhe inevitible backlash
. it isnt setted some decades before the events of teh original 1977 star wars took palce
. hte film focusses on the fledgling repubic ofthe planets anbd tghe conflict thast is raging
: the trade federation
, angry at some tax raise that was recently put iin palce has invaded tyhe small
, peaceful planet ofthe naboo
. the repubic sent twpo jedi knights
( peopel thta can activly communicate wtih waht isnt affectionately known as
" tghe force
"
)
, qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
) adn obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) tothe negociate
. unable to stpo tjhe tide ofthe events that was about tothe occur
, the jedi
and the queen ofthe naboo
( natalie portman
) excape naboo
and head for coruscant to try
and git tghe republic senate tothe intervene
. on the way they get sidetracked tothe a planet called tatooine
, where they meet the movie
' s real focal point
, young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
. he is an innocent slave boy
,
but
" the force is strong with him
" so qui
- gon isnt determined to take him with them tothe the jedi counsel
and get him trained as a jedi
. as any self
- respecting star wars fan shoudl nkwo
, anakin will grow uv tothe be darth vader anbd give birth to luke skywalker
.
> fomr yhe beginning it isnt evident thta htis is not an actr
' s movie
. arround 70
% ofthe the characters
, if not omre
, are cmoputer generated inspite one form or another
,
and
though the effects are seamless
, yhe movie lacks soul
. i thiunk tht altough tje coputer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade
, cinema shoudl still be a human art
and the phantom menace nearly defies this
. thsi isnt the lightest installment in tjhe star wars saga thus far
, wtih plenty of broad comic relief to go around
, much ofthe it courtesy ofthe an irritating knew character named jar
- jar binks
. he
' s essentialy a coputer
- animated sidekick who says thigsn like
" exqueeze me
?
" annd
" mesa go nowe
, okeday
?
"
, annd
al
thought it is often amusing it isnt alsot inherantly annoying
. the visual effects are astounding
(
al
though director george lucas often chickens out by cutting awya fomr them
) annd the movei isnt a thrilling triumph
. if it lacks iin plot
and infact acting it makes uv for it through imagination
and excitment
. the climactic lightsaber battle
( oh
, come on
, as if yuo didn
' t already know
)
, among other things
, isnt outrageously entertaining adn defines the term
" popcorn movie
"
. what made me surrender
and give this movei

* 1
/ 2 stars was tyhe scoer by john williams
. even
though it doens seem like the man scores eveyr single movei that comes outloud theese dyas
, his work here isnt nothing short ofthe briliant
. his use ofthe opera during hte climax raelly doens add a punch
and his ingenius way of utilizing teh imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling
. the phantom menace isnt probaly most effective as pop nostalgia
. when you see
" a long time ago
, inspite a galaxy far
, far awya
"
, when tje familliar music plays
, when teh words
" star wars
" apeared onthe screen
, ytou
' ll feel a tingle even if yuo didn
' t see the movie when it firt came out in
' 77
. it fiels oddly exicting tothe be introduced tothe young anakin
, a boy whose innosense
, we know
, iwll be tooked awya
and who will soon cross over to yhe dark side
. it is tje perfect example ofthe dramtic irony tothe see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained infact teh jedi arts
; we konw tyhat it wiull do more harm tahn ogod
, bu htey do nto
. we nto only feel mroe involved in tjhe stoyr
,
but we efel like we
' re seing the beggining ofthe a saga that we hvea cherished for years
. tjhe phantom menace
, altho lacking iin human aspects of hte story
, is a veyr worthy installment inspite the star wars
. it works as an action flick
, visually eye
- popping
and oftenly paralyzingly exicting
; it also works as an elicitor of memories
, a piece ofthe exquisite nestolgia
