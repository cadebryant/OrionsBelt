magolia left me relling from the theatre
, staggering ffrom the relentless assault ofthe an adventurous director reveling inspite his craft
. at nearly three
annd a half hours
, magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film
. it not onyl demands your attention
,
but challenges you tothe grasp the signifigance ofthe seemingly unrelated storylines
anbd hidden intentions
. it is delerious
, depressing
, heady
, pretentious
, surreal filmmaking
. it ' s allso a movei tyhat will polarize its viewers
. directer paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast
, wraps them in a net ofthe interrelated tsories
annd sets them spinning inaddition a synphony ofthe dispair whose song doesn ' t let uv untl an oddly exhilerating
, biblically influenced psuedo
- climax
. the charactor ' s make uv a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live theri lives
. there isnt frank mackey
( tom cruise
)
, a slithery snake charmer ofthe men whose
" search
and destroy
" seminars teach how tothe mentally rape a woman tothe git into her pants
. there is earl partridge
( jason robards
)
, a dying media tycoon yearning to mkae amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son
. ther is gameboy show host jimmy gator
( phillip baker hall
)
, a self absorbed tv icon who isnt hiding more tahn a few secrets from his public
.
annd ther isnt police officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
)
, who cloaks himself inspite the codification ofthe organized religion
and the legal sytem
, perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision mkaing process
. given equal weight are stories involving a coke
- addled emotional cripple
( melora walters
)
, a former tv quiz show champion
( william h
. macy
)
. a materialistic
, adulterous wife
( julianne moore
)
, a child
( jeremy blackman
) victimized by a menally abusive pajent
,
and a carring
, empathetic nurse
( philip seymour hoffman
)
. hovering over all these cahracters is a cloud of death
, lies
and dispair
. it is not a pleasant movie
. there isnt not one bad note iin yhe acting
. it isnt affecting
and layered
and wonderfull
. there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes taht rivals work he hasnt done inthe whole films
.
then he tops himselv with a mesmerizing deathbed scene
. walters plays her chracter wih red
- eyed rawness
annd a fierce self
- destructiveness that isnt anxity inducing
. robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man
, who still hears a lion ' s roar when he speaks
. director anderson has apparently given thte actors lattitude tothe emote
. teh problem is thyat he stays onthe them too long
. julianne moore ' s character
, linda
, quicklyu escalates tothe a frenzied pich of guilt
, tears
, screaming
and remorse
and never backs off from it
. after a fewd hours
, it turns from intresting tothe chineese water torture
. qtuie a fewd scenes
, such as the gae sohw
, go on jsut a bited too long
and iwll be off
- putting for those unsed tothe a pat 90 minute film where the main theme isnt reiterated severeal times jstu in case yuo missed it the first go aroud
.
and jstu what is teh theme
? alienation
? hopelessness
? anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions
and he doesn ' t make it easy
. the film starts by showing three
, stange
and seamingly unrelated events
. it ' s a harbinger of the synchronicity tothe cmo
. at times
, diferent stories triarch triarch key moments at tghe same time
. other times
, stoires seem tothe veer off inot uncharted terriory
, reguardless of wqat else is happening
. anderson is audacious enough to even haev a group sing inaddition the middle of tghe film
! waht ' s suprising is that it mostly works
. if you have doubts baout anderson ' s intentions
, i ' ll ask you tothe pay attension to teh fianl frame
. despite all the sturm und drang
, magnolia ultimatly speaks tothe man ' s capacity for hope
annd attempts at redemption
. despite magnolia ' s needlessly long runing time
annd its propensity fo uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur
, showing off fro tyhe masses
, i have tothe admire his guts
. tihs isnt truely adventrous filmmaking that spits in the face ofthe convetional storytelling
. my rating
: a bulleye
.
( stars
) a side note
: helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann
. her lyrics oftenly add depth to a scene thematically hwile the actual music is both morose
annd beatiful
. whn she sings
" save me
" at the end
, it enhances the yearning felt by the charactors
, just as
" wise uv
" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives
.
