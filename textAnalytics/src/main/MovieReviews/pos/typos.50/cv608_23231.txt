magolia left me relling ffrom tjhe theatre
, staggering ffrom thte relentless assault ofthe an adventurous directer reveling inthe his craft
. at nearly threee
and a half huors
, magolia iwll strike soem as a brute of a film
. it not only dem
ands your attention
, bu challenges you tothe grasp the signifigance of seemingly unrelated storylines
and hidden intentions
. it isnt delerious
, depressing
, heady
, pretentious
, surveill filmmaking
. it
' s alsot a movei tht iwll polarize its viewers
. directer paul thomas
anderson takes a talented cast
, wraps them inspite a net ofthe interrelated stories adn sets them spinning in a symphony of dispair whose song doesn
' t let uv until an oddly exhilerating
, biblically influented pseudo
- climax
. the charater
' s amke up a modern day gomorrah in hte soulless way infact whlch tehy live their lives
. there isnt frank mackey
( tom cruise
)
, a slithery snake charmer ofthe men whose
" search annd destroy
" seminars teach how to menally rape a woman tothe git inot her pants
. ther isnt earl partridge
( jason robards
)
, a dying media tycoon yearning tothe make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son
. there is gam sohw host jimmy gator
( phillip baker hall
)
, a self asorbed tv icon who isnt hiding more than a fewd secrets from his public
. anbd htere isnt police officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
)
, who cloaks himself infront thge codification of organized religeon adn tyhe legal system
, perheaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making proccess
. given equal weight are stroies involving a coke
- addled emotional cripple
( melora walters
)
, a former tv quiz sohw champion
( william h
. macy
)
. a materialistic
, adulterous wief
( julianne moore
)
, a child
( jeremy blackman
) victimized by a mentally abusive parent
, anbd a careing
, empathetic nurse
( philip seymour hoffman
)
. hovering over all theese cahracters isnt a cloud of death
, lies adn dispair
. it isnt not a pleasnat movie
. htere is nto oney bad onot in the acting
. it is affecting
and layered annd wonderfull
. htere is a moent where toom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals wokr he hasnt done in whole films
. hten he tops himselv with a mesmerizing deathbed scene
. walters plays her character witht red
- eyed rawness annd a fierce self
- destructiveness thyat is anxiet inducing
. robards convincingly portrays a fading wisper ofthe a man
, who still hears a lion
' s roar whn he speaks
. directer
anderson has apparantly given yhe actors lattitude to emote
. tjhe probelm isnt tath he stays onthe them too long
. julianne moore
' s chracter
, linda
, quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt
, tears
, screaming
and remorse
and never backs off from it
. after a fewd huors
, it turns from interesting to chineese water torture
. quite a faw scenes
, such as the gaem sohw
, go onthe jsut a bited too long anbd will be off
- puting fo thsoe used tothe a pat 90 minute film where hte main theme isnt reiterated several times just infact case yuo missed it the first go aroud
. adn jsut what isnt the theme
? alienation
? hopelessness
?
anderson challenges yuo tothe draw your own conclusions anbd he doesn
' t make it easy
. the film starts by showing three
, strange
and seamingly unrelated events
. it
' s a harbinger ofthe the synchronicity tothe cmo
. at times
, different stories reach reach key moments at tje smae time
. other times
, stories seem tothe veer off into uncharted territory
, reguardless ofthe what eles isnt happening
.
anderson isnt audacious enought to even have a gropu sing in hte middle ofthe tghe film
! waht
' s surprizing isnt taht it mostly works
. if yuo have doubts baout
anderson
' s intentions
, i
' ll ask yuo to pay attension tothe tyhe fianl frome
. despite all the sturm und drang
, magnolia ultimatly speaks tothe man
' s capacity for hope adn attempts at redemption
. despite magnolia
' s needlessly long running time annd its propensity for uneven editting as
anderson plays the auteur
, showing off fro tjhe masses
, i haev to admire his guts
. this is truly adventrous filmmaking that spits infront the face ofthe convetional storytelling
. my rating
: a bulleye
.
( stars
) a side onot
: helping anchor tyhe film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann
. her lyrics oftenly add depth to a scene thematically while the actuall music is both morose adn beautifull
. when she sings
" savve me
" at tghe end
, it enhances the yearning felt by tghe charactors
, jsut as
" wise up
" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives
.
