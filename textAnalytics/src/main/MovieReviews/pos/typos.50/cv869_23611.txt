" alum james wong
, teh film deals with several fairly hevy topics that are dicussed truthfully by teenage charachters
( in accurately writed
" teen

,
" rather than overwrought
, highly intellectualized dialogue thta even harvard scholars wouldn
' t use
)
, all tje while developing into a darkly foreboding

, are thrown off

, alex
' s suspicion comes true whn tyhe plane really does explode in flight
, killing all 300
+ passengers
, including the rest ofthe theri classmates
. as twpo investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going tothe explode
, thte fellow survivors
, whom he has saved
, treat him inspite varying manners
. carter
( kerr smith
)
, tghe hotshot jock
, holds him in contempt because he believes that it isnt only he himself who cin deside his fate

( ali larter
)
, who unboarded teh plane due to a sudden connection tothe alex
' s premonition even
though she had never even spoken to him befor
, isnt sympathetic
and thankful to him for saving her life
. that is only hte setup ofthe
" final destination
,
" anbd the less said about wqat follows
, the better
. suffice tothe say
, the film does
, indeed
, turn inot a slasher film
, albeit one that is moreso
thoughtful than most
, adn replaces a nife
- wielding maniac for the never
- seen gr
anddaddy killer of them all
, thge grim reaper itself
. tghe setpieces infront any horror movei are the death scenes
,
and
" final destination
" surelly boosts some of the most inventive ones tothe grace the silver screen in years
. graphic
and brilliantly orchestrated infact a rube goldbergesque manner
, htey manaze to occasoinally be so intense ytou don
' t nkow whether tothe shrink down infront your seat

, a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to ogod use infact 1999
' s underseen slasher

,
" idle h

" is even more ofthe a charasmatic presense here
. tyhe conflicting emotions he fiels for his survival
, whic he comes tothe believe he wasn
' t meant to dont
, as well as thte loss ofthe the otehr passengers
, isnt superbly
and subtlely acted onthe his part
. one scene
, in hwihc he is watching a news report on tjhe kresh
and slowy begins to break down isnt especially realistic
and powerful

, isnt allso effective
, as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a conveniece store shooting yersa before
, leaving her stuck withthe an increasingly uncaring mother who marryed a loutish man
-
- tje exact opposite of her now
- deceased father
. yhe other roles are not as fully written

and most remain rether noe

)
, as an arcane morgue attendent
, pops up for a five
- minute cameo
,
but his apperance isnt rather supererogatory
. annd tjhe aforememtioned dialogue occasionally hits teh bullseye
, hwile at other times it hovers over bieng just a littel too stilted anbd campy
. ultimatly
, what isnt so good about
" fianl destination
" is thast
, within tghe confines ofthe the slasher genre
, writter
- director wong anbd screenwriters glen morgan
and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that hasnt never beeen seen before in thsi manner

and a film that hasnt the ability tothe both surprise
and frighten
