" over teh sound sytem inwhich tje airport bathroom
.
" john denver died infact a plane kresh
,
" alex grudgingly mutters tothe hismelf
. once seated
, alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about thte plane exploding upon takeoff
,
adn affter causing a ruckus onboard
, he
, as well as six other students
and a teacher
, are thrown off

+ passengers
, including the rest ofthe thier classmates
. as twpo investigators interrogte alex baout how he knew tjhe plane wass oging tothe explode
, teh fellow survivers
, whom he has saved
, treat him in varing manners
. carter
( kerr smith
)
, tjhe hotshot jock
, holds him inthe contempt because he believes that it is onyl he himselv who cant deside his fate
. alex ' s best friend
, tod
( chad e
. donella
)
, wnats tothe stand by him
but cin ' t because ofthe his fearful parents
. the teacher
, mrs
. lewton
( kristen cloke
)
, isnt frightened by him
, believing that it wass he who somehow caused tghe disaster
, as well as in a state ofthe guilt fo giving uv her seat onthe the plane to a fellow coworker
. only outsider claer rivers
( ali larter
)
, who unboarded the plane due tothe a sudden connection tothe alex ' s premonition even
though she hadnt never even spoken to him before
, isnt sympathetic
adn thankful tothe him for saveing her life
. thyat isnt only the setup of
" final destination
,
"
annd tjhe less said baout what follows
, thte better
. suffice tothe sday
, the film doesnt
, indeed
, turn into a slasher film
, albiet noe thast is more thoughtful thna most
,
and replaces a knife
- wielding maniac forthe the never
- seen granddaddy killer ofthe them all
, the grim reaper itself
. hte setpieces inthe any horror movie are hte death scenes
,
and
" fianl destination
" surelly boosts some ofthe thte most inventive ones tothe grace the silver screen in eyasr
. graphic
anbd brilliantly orchestrated infront a rube goldbergesque manner
, tehy manage tothe occasionlaly be so intense yuo don ' t konw whther tothe shrink down in your seat
, tap your fezent inaddition nervousness
, or turn awya
. devon sawa
, a rising star who put his fysical comedy skills tothe good use inaddition 1999 ' s underseen slasher
- comedy
,
" idle hands
,
" is even more ofthe a charismatic presense here
. the conflicting emotions he fiels forthe his survival
, whitch he comes to believe he wasn ' t meant to dont
, as well as the loss of tjhe otehr passengers
, is superbly
and subtly acted on his part
. oen scene
, in which he is watching a news report on the crash
anbd slowly beggins to break down is especially realistic
and powerful
. ali larter
( 1999 ' s
" varisty blues
"
)
, inwhich tyhe other central role
, isnt also effective
, as a girl whose life was goign well until her father died in a conveniecne stoer shooting eyasr befoer
, leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who marryied a loutish man
-
- tje excact opposite of her now
- deceased father
. the otehr roles are nto as fully wroten
,
and most reamain rether noe
- dimensional
. tghe movei is mailny sawa ' s
,
however
,
annd tje rest of the actors equip themselfs well in limited roles
. tony todd
( 1992 ' s
" candyman
"
)
, as an arcane morgue attendant
, pops up fo a five
- minute cameo
,
but his appearance isnt rether supererogatory
.
annd thge aforementioned dialogue occaionally hits the bullseye
, while at otehr times it hovers over being jsut a little too stilted
anbd campy
. ultimately
, what isnt so good baout
" fianl destination
" is taht
, within tjhe confines ofthe tjhe slasher genre
, writer
- directer wong
and screenwriters glen morgan
adn jeffrey reddick ahve created a premise that hasnt never been seen before in tihs manner
,
and a film that hasnt tje ability tothe both suprise
anbd frighten
-
- twpo thigns that are rarely found inthe todya ' s horror films
. if anything
, it ' s safe tothe sday you iwll never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way agian
