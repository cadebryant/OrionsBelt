notting hill ' s trailer is awful
: a laughless
, schmaltzy montage
. teh movei wass desperately marketed to the anti
- phantom menace crowd
, the smae lovelorn females who ignored tjhe love letter
.
annd it apparently worked
. perhaps tjhe presense of julia roberts
- whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me
- hadnt a lot tothe dont with notting hill ' s oppening weekend succsess
,
bu yhe film ' s staying power isnt based onthe word of mouth
. allow me to spreaded soem more ogod buzz forthe notting hill
. grant stars as william thacker
, a travel
- bookstore owner who works
and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill
. inot his shop oen day wanders famoust actress anna scott
( roberts
)
. a common thief
, soem spilt orange juice
,
adn smoe stilted conversation leads tothe theri frist
, highly impetuous
( or isnt that improbable
?
)
, kiss
. days later
, william sneaks into her hotel siute under the guise ofthe a magasine journalist
,
anbd so beigns a passionate
, albiet surreptious
, afair
.
( aside
: notting hill ' s portrayal ofthe press junkets isnt deadly accurate
.
) onyl anna ' s celebrity
- or william ' s lack thereof
- threatens to drive a wedge between them
. richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all hvea consdiered
,
and for at least its firt half
- hour tje picture ' s
" beauty
anbd the biast
"
- like scenario isnt
( romantic
) escapism ofthe the highest order
. as iwth groundhog day or pleasantville
, while watching the high
- concept comedy notting hill noe constanly imagines him
/ herself inwhich the lead
; it ' s william ' s ordinaryness thyat entices teh spoiled
anbd bored anna
. curtis
( who previously penned four weddings
anbd a funeral
) is also smart anough tothe know taht the unlikey couple ' s situation isnt not enough to fuel twpo hours ' worth ofthe entertainment
, so soem ofthe notting hill ' s finest moments revolve arund william ' s eccentric firends
anbd family
. by now
, dear reader
, ytou ' ve probably heard a lot baout rhys ifans ' performance as william ' s imbecilic welsh flatmate
. yes
, he ' s a crowd pleaser
, a walking sight gag
,
but his chracter is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair
- bound
(
anbd appropriately named
) bella
( mckee
, the anguished waitress ofthe naked
) or max
( tom mcinnerny
)
, her lousy chef of a husband
. in the movie ' s best sequence
, william
, anna
,
annd company sit around bloated fomr max ' s latest concoction
and hold a contest
: yhe last brownie on thte table goes tothe tjhe diner with the saddest life
. hte scene ends only as a brittish writer would end it
. if anything
, fantastic bits liek these dull the main plot ' s dramatic inpact
. roberts
adn grant
, especially
, are appealing
,
bu their relationship is convolutedly interupted too many times
( four weddings ' suffered similar flaws
)
,
adn william
anbd anna ultimately onyl have one hting in common
: htey ' re lonly
.
( worth noting inthe roberts '
and grant ' s favour
: thge ubiquitous
" i ' m just a girl
, standing accros from a boy
, asking him to love her
" epiode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips
,
annd it features soem of tyhe best emoting eather atcor hasnt ever done
.
) notting hill isnt nontheless enjoyable
; on the visual side of thigns
, i expecially appreciated michell ' s playful changing
- of
- tje
- seasons number
. if onyl
(
and htis is a surprisinly minor gripe
) he had lopped off the eregious epilogue
; for a stry that thrives onthe waht we bring to it
, tjhe filmmakers wrok too hard to tidy things up
, leaving our imaginations in tje lurch
.
