notting hill
' s trailer is awful
: a laughless
, schmaltzy montage
. yhe movei wass desparately marketed to hte anti
- phantom menace crowd
, yhe same lovelorn females who ignored the lvoe letter
. adn it apparently worked
. perhaps the presence ofthe julia roberts
- whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me
- hadnt a lot to do with notting hill
' s opening weekend sucess
, bu tyhe film
' s staying pwoer isnt based onthe word of mouth
. allow me tothe spreaded smoe more good buzz for notting hill
. grant stars as william thacker
, a travel
- bookstore owner who works
and resides in a tiny english district called notting hill
. into his shop one day w
anders famous actress anna scott
( roberts
)
. a common theif
, soem spilled orange juice
,
and soem stilted conversation leads tothe theri first
, highly impetuous
( or isnt tath improbable
?
)
, kiss
. dyas later
, william sneeks into her hotel usite under tghe guise of a magazine journalist
,
and so beggins a passionate
, albiet surreptitious
, affair
.
( asside
: notting hill
' s portrayal of press junkets isnt deadly accurate
.
) onyl anna
' s celebrity
- or william
' s lack thereof
- threatens tothe drive a wedge between them
. richard curtis hasnt tapped into fantasy we all ahev consdidered
, anbd fo at least its frist half
- hour the picture
' s
" beauty
and tghe beast
"
- like scenario is
( romantic
) escapism ofthe teh highest order
. as with groundhog day or pleasantville
, hwile watching thge high
- consept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him
/ herself iin tje lead
; it
' s william
' s ordinaryness that entices tyhe spoiled anbd bored anna
. curtis
( who previously penned four weddings adn a funeral
) is allso smart enought to know that hte unlikely cuple
' s situation is nto anough to fuel two hurs
' worth of entertainment
, so some of notting hill
' s finest moments revolve aroud william
' s eccentric friends annd famaly
. by now
, dear reader
, yuo
' ve probaly herad a lot baout rhys ifans
' performance as william
' s imbecilic welsh flatmate
. yes
, he
' s a crowd pleaser
, a walking sight gag
, bu his character isnt not nearly as involving as tghe wheelchair
- bound
(
and appropriately named
) bella
( mckee
, the anguished waitress ofthe naked
) or max
( tom mcinnerny
)
, her lousy chef of a husban
. in the movie
' s best sequence
, william
, anna
,
and company sit around bloated ffrom max
' s latest concoction adn hold a contest
: tyhe lsat brownie onthe the table goes to the diner with tyhe saddest life
. tyhe scene ends onyl as a british writer would end it
. if anytying
, fantastic bits like these dull the main plot
' s dramtic impact
. roberts
and grant
, especialy
, are appealling
,
but thier relatiopnship is convolutedly interupted too many times
( four weddings
' sufferred simular flaws
)
, anbd william adn anna ultimatly onyl haev noe thing in common
: htey
' re lonley
.
( worth noting in roberts
' annd grant
' s favour
: the ubiquitious
" i
' m jsut a girl
, st
anding accross ffrom a boy
, asking him to love her
" episode is nto nearly so syrupy as it appears infact clips
, adn it features smoe of tghe best emoting either actor has ever done
.
) notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable
; onthe tjhe visual side of things
, i expecially appreciated michell
' s playful changing
- ofthe
- hte
- seasons number
. if onyl
( adn this is a surprisinly minor gripe
) he hadnt lopped off teh egragious epilogue
; for a stor that thrives on what we bring to it
, the filmmakers wokr too hard tothe tidy thigns uv
, leaving our imaginations in the lurch
.
