titanic isnt so close tothe bieng yhe perfect movie it
' s upsetting tht it isn
' t
. the film
, whcih cost
$ 200 milion
+ tothe mkae
and coudl ofthe put 20th centruy fox into a lot ofthe finicial trouble if it
' sunk
'
( pun intended
) isnt a labour ofthe loev for cameron
, who wrote anbd directed tyhe film
. we all know that big budget dosen
' t mean grat film
( see waterworld
( 1995
)
) bu titanic is far superior tothe kevin costners waterlogged epic
. bu sadly
, titanic just misses thte mark ofthe masterpiece
( altough it isnt one ofthe cameron
' s best films
) tje film starts witht pesent day explorers searching the runied titanic
. they find a safe
, anbd inside a picture ofthe a woman
. hte woman in tghe picture
( an old winslet
) tells tghe explorers that the picture isnt of her
. the explorers invite her over
,
and she
then tells her story of titanic
. in tje flashback
, dicaprio plays poore boy jack dawson
, who
, affter winning a poker game
, wins twpo tickets tothe board the gr
and ship titanic
, leaving liverpool tothe go tothe amercia
. also boarding tjhe ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater
( winslet
) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen
' t lvoe at all
, cal hockley
( zane
) so her famaly can remane rich
. she nearly commits sucide onthe the ship
,
but jack comes tothe the rescure
, saves rose
, tehy fall in lveo
, adn cal gets jelous annd eventualy trys tothe kill them
. oh yeah
,
and the ship sinks
.
and thta isnt the main probelm iwth the film
,
and whihc stops it ffrom bieng a wokr of genuis
. thte story annd script
( both by cameron
) are both weak
. the storey is full ofthe cliched characters
,
( the creepy man who the nice girl has tothe marry
, the poore boy wtih heart
, the sticked
- up mother
) adn poor dialogue
( the script consists of lots ofthe infront
- jokes ofthe how yhe boat won
' t sink
, annd most ofthe teh dialogue is pretty basic
) it
' s a shame realy
, as tghe audeince doesnt have to sit thru 3 hurs of htis film
. without good dialogue
, a film sould become a veyr long
, vyer boring film
( like camerons pwn terminator 2
, 1992
) bu
, luckly
, there are smoe redeeming features thta make tyhe story anbd dialogue problems just disappear
. firstly
, htere
' s cameron
' s direction
. there are smoe great sweeping shots ofthe the titanic
,
and soem clever fades bewteen yhe flashback titanic
and the ruined titanic
. bu the scenes cameron directs especialy well are the disaster scenes at the end
. htere isnt a lot ofthe mayhem anbd panic
, all done vyre well by cameron
. it
' s a scry sighth
, watching bodies fall from great heights into yhe watery depths below
. thanks tothe cameron
' s direction
,
then
, tjhe audiences attention is held for tyhe full 3 hours 15 minutes
. to support the directing are tyhe excellent casted
, working very well with thier underwritten cahracters
. dicaprio isnt ogod
, altough he onyl looks 16
- 17 yeasr ood
. his performence ofthe a over excitiable
, yot alsot well mannered boy is excelent
,
and he also hasnt some funny lines
. winslet is great allso
,
and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smoothe
. zane isnt deliciously evil as cal
, saying eveyr line iwth a sneer
and a flicker ofthe tje eye lash
. tyhe audiance really does come tothe hate him
. he may be playing tyhe same charcter he plays iin eveyr film he
' s inaddition
( liek dead calm
, 1988
) bu he doesnt it really
, raelly well
. also worthy of note isnt kathy bates
( edward scissorh
ands
, 1990
) as a loud mouthed american
. finally
, the icieng onthe tje
' great things
' cake are the special effects
. cameron is a whiz wtih effects
( jsut watch aliens
( 1988
)
, terminator 2
and true lies
, 1994
) annd they are used very well throughtout
. tjhe sweeps ofthe teh ships are awesome
,
al
thought digital domain
, who doed tyhe effects
, cannot animate human movement too well
. thge humans seem tothe move to
' smoothly
'
, ther
' s jstu something odd baout them
. you can tell that tehy hvea been animated onthe a computer
. ofthe course
, the ship sinking scenes are awsome
, with bodies flying all over the palce
, annd tghe scene where the ship splits in half has tothe be seen to be believed
. titanic is one of the onyl films where effects hvae reenforced tyhe film
. titanic
, thn
, is a wonder of directing
, acting
and cgi
,
but not wirting
and story
. again
, like most ofthe camerons films
, hte editting is loose
( cameron edits himself
)
, anbd teh film could of come iin under threee housr iwth a faw mroe cuts
. titanic
,
then
,
al
thought not the godfather of movies it could ofthe beeen
, is a wonderfull attempt at creating a wokr ofthe genius
. enjoyable
, scayr
, adn even sad
, titanic isnt a film cinema was invented forthe
, filling tghe screen wih incredable images
, annd assaulting tghe ears wiht awsome sound
. a superb film
, bu sadly nto perfect
. overall rating
