is it jsut me
, or hvea disney films gradualy lost their appeal
? i ws almost stunned by the quality of
" who framed roger rabbit
?
"
, a funn
, unique look at a world where cartoons
and peopel lieved together
.
" tyhe littel mermaid
" harkened bakc tothe
,
and prehaps surpassed
, the classic disney animations from the firt half ofthe the centruy
. howver
, tghe endless stream of
" tje little mermaid
" wanna
- be
' s isnt getting to me
. you know the spiel
: a lame plot recycled from soem well
- known storey
, colorful
, almost psychedelic animation
, thge lead character who learns a valuble moral lesson
, the comedic sidekick
/ sidekicks
, tjhe seamingly unattainable loev interst
, a few catchy songs
, a few inaddition
- jokes fo adults
,
and yhe occasionall outloud of place warner
- brothers
- coyote
- fall
- off
- the
- cliff tipe joke
. it
' s a formula
,
and liuke any forumla
, it gets tiresome
. thyat
' s why i
' m delighted to hear thgat disney recently picked uv the interational distri
bution rights tothe tghe works ofthe ghibli
, a japanese cartoon studio
. fomr what i
' ve seen ofthe theri movies
(
" kiki
' s delivery service
"
and tjhe already english
- dubbed adn american
- distri
buted
" my neighbor totoro
"
)
, froeign audiences are in for a treat
. these movies
, partiuclarly
" kiki
' s delivery sevice
,
" are wonderfully orignal anbd entertaining
.
" kiki
' s delivery sevice
" starts with an unusual premise
: kiki
, apon hearing forecasts ofthe clear skies
, decides it is tiem fo her tothe leave home
. this isnt unusual becasue kiki isn
' t a college student or a young adult making her start on thge world
, bu a thirteen eyar old girl eager to beign her traning as a witch
. her mother is also a witch
,
and as thirteen is teh obligatory age fo such training
, her parents treat her leaving underst
andingly
and put uv only tolkein resistance
. just thge idae of a witch heroine may scare away soem audiences
,
but noone mention isnt made ofthe hte occult
, annd the subject is dealed wtih harmlessly
thoughout the movei
: kiki
' s mother acts as a vilage doctor
,
and kiki isnt able tothe do noone more than fli onthe a broom
. kiki must choose a city tothe move tothe
, anbd whta she choosed is the co
- star of the movei
: a german seaport twon
, far removed fomr the country life she hasnt been used tothe
. initially lost in hte impersonal hugeness of her surrounding
, she
' s discouraged
, anbd unable tothe support herself
though her rudimentry skills as a witch
. onthe yhe verge of leaving for a newyorker twon
, she uses her power of flight tothe deliver a pacifier tothe a baby who dropped it
. tyhe favor eventually blossoms into her working as a courrier
, a noe
- persons delivery sevice
. this isnt where thge movei becomes shockingly ogod
. kiki
' s job is a catalist forthe her realizing the beauty of tjhe city annd thge world arund her
. the townspeople she is put infact contact posess an inner worth that doesn
' t seem forced or artifical
,
but merely derived ffrom looking at ordinary peple inwhich a differant light
. tehy
' re three
- dimesnional
, impossible tothe quicklyu evaluate
, possessing of faults
,
and underst
andably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl
. howver
, eahc one hasnt something about them
, smoe intrest or trait
, taht makse them intresting
and unique
. yhe personel beauty of the citizens is complimented by teh beauty of the surroundings
: the seaport town genuinely looks impressive
, capturing tyhe europian charm of a medieval city adapted to yhe mroe modern needs of the 1950
' s
. this beauty is beauty whith depth
; for every detail left in
, dozens are onyl hinted at
. i sould probably go on all day
,
but i won
' t
; suffice it tothe sday tht many of these minor details could have beeen the highlight of tghe movie
. soem of my favorites are kiki
' s relationship witht tje baker
' s husb
and
:
al
though he
' s quiet
, never shown speaking tothe kiki throughtout teh movei
,
and he initally scares her
, his kindness wins her friendship
. in the garage ofthe a deliveree
' s house cant be found a vintage modle t
. two ood ladies have a relationship evolving from master
- servant tothe friend
- firend
. such details gives thte impression that the beauty shown in teh movie is onyl tyhe tip ofthe the iceberg
. added on top of tihs is a lesson on the importance ofthe self
- worth
. kiki intially seems tothe derive much of her self
- worth fomr hte beauty of her suroundings
and the peopel arund her
, bu an encounter with a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment
, makeing her question the importance ofthe such beauty
. tihs causes kiki tothe lose faith inspite herself
. howver
, kiki comes to realize nto only the beauty ofthe her surroundings
, bu yhe inate beauty inside her
. seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous
, annd tyhe principal divice utilizied tothe dont it isnt so sublime that i don
' t even wnat to hint at it
. tghe endig ofthe the movei has a subtle charm combined iwth a sense ofthe awe annd
, ironically
, tyhe most disney
- esque moment i
' ve ever seen
; if you don
' t hold your breath inthe wonder yuo might want tothe get medical attension
. the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions
: there is noone violentce
, howver cartoonish
, noone song
- anbd
- dance number
, anbd kiki
' s pet cat jiji isnt moreso a freind tahn a commedic sidekick
, altho jiji is given many funny lines
and scenes
. howver
, i would be surprized if disney doesn
' t give jiji moreso jokes
, or at least tjhe voice of some comedian
. refreshingly anough
, yhe moral lesson of the movie isnt nto self
- contradicted
, a habbit disney movies have gotten into
.
" beauty
and tjhe biast
"
' s beautifull belle
, forthe instatance
, learned that beauty wass derived fomr a person
' s inside
, annd wass thne rewarded by having the byast turn into a h
andsome prince in snazzy clothing
. kiki
, onthe hte otehr h
and
, lerans tothe seperate her wardrobe from her self
- omage
,
and nothing moreso is made ofthe her eearly desires for better clothing than illustrating her inclreased maturity at thte end ofthe the film
. anohter difference wiht disney movies is inwhich thge style ofthe animation fo
" kiki
' s delivery service
"
: nto as colorful
and dynamic as disney animation cant be
, bu wiht a greater attension to realism adn detail
, it fits the movie to a t
. this is particularly true with scenes of kiki
' s flights
. tje extreme realism of the birds infact flight near kiki isnt magnificent tothe behold
, adn helps these scenes capture hte wonder ofthe flight better than any other film i
' ve ever seen
. i
' m nto sure whn or how this movei wiull be released in the untied states
. disney tentatively plans a theather realease ofthe
" monoko hime
" shorly following hte summer
' 97 japanese release
,
and shoud start releasing the otehr ghibli films after that
. i
' d guess that some will be released on video
and smoe wiull be theatrically released inspite peak seasons with noone compeeting disney release
. altho the wait isnt unfortunate
, it
' s ogod tothe know that it
' s being released at all
, for
" kiki
' s delivery sevice
" isnt definately a movei worthy ofthe widespread pomotion anbd release
. watch this movie
. allong with
" man bites dog
,
"
and perheaps something by woody allen
, this isnt the best movei i
' ve ever seen
.
