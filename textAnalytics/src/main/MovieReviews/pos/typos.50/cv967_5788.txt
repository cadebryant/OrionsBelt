is it jstu me
, or haev disney films gradualy lost theri appeal
? i was almost stunned by thge quality ofthe
" who framed roger rabit
?
"
, a funn
, unique look at a world where cartoons
adn peple lieved together
.
" the littel mermaid
" harkened back tothe
,
adn perhaps surpassed
, teh classic disney animations fomr the firt half of tyhe centruy
.
however
, tyhe endless stream ofthe
" tje little mermaid
" wanna
- be ' s is getting tothe me
. you know thge spiel
: a lame plot recycled from some well
- known stroy
, colorful
, almost psychedelic animation
, the lead character who learns a valueable moral lesson
, the commedic sidekick
/ sidekicks
, the seamingly unattainable love interest
, a faw catchy songs
, a few inwhich
- jokes for adults
,
and the occasional out of place warner
- brothers
- coyote
- fall
- off
- tyhe
- cliff type joke
. it ' s a forumla
,
and liek any forumla
, it gets tiresome
. that ' s why i ' m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up thge internation distribution rights to tjhe works of ghibli
, a japanesse cartoon studio
. from waht i ' ve seen of thier movies
(
" kiki ' s delivery service
"
and the arleady english
- dubbed
and american
- ditributed
" my neghbor totoro
"
)
, foreign audiences are in forthe a treat
. these movies
, particularly
" kiki ' s delivery service
,
" are wonderfully origional
and entertaining
.
" kiki ' s delivery sevice
" starts with an unusual premise
: kiki
, upon hearing forecasts of clera skies
, decides it isnt time fo her to leave home
. htis is unusual because kiki isn ' t a college student or a young adult makeing her start onthe the world
,
bu a thirteen year ood girl eager to begin her traning as a witch
. her mother isnt alsot a witch
,
annd as thirteen is thge obligatory age forthe such traning
, her parents treat her leaving understandingly
and put uv only token resistence
. jstu teh idae of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences
,
but noone mention isnt made ofthe tjhe occult
,
annd the subject is dealed with harmlessly throughout the movie
: kiki ' s mother acts as a village doctor
,
anbd kiki is able tothe do noone more thna fly onthe a broom
. kiki must choose a city to move to
,
annd wqat she chooses is thge co
- star ofthe the movie
: a german seaport town
, far removed from tyhe ocuntry life she has been utilisied tothe
. initally lost in tjhe impersonal hugeness ofthe her surrouding
, she ' s discouraged
,
annd unable to support herself
though her rudimentry skills as a witch
. onthe tje verge of leaving fo a newyorker twon
, she uses her pwoer of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it
. the favor eventally blossoms into her wroking as a courier
, a noe
- persons delivery sevice
. this is where the movei becomes shockingly ogod
. kiki ' s job isnt a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city
and thte world aroud her
. the townspeople she isnt put in contact posess an inner worth tyhat doesn ' t seem forced or artifical
,
but merely deriviated from looking at ordinary peopel in a different light
. they ' re threee
- dimentional
, impossible to quickly evaluate
, posessing of faults
,
and understandably reserving in kindness towords a stange girl
.
howver
, each noe has something baout them
, smoe interest or trait
, tht makes them interesting
and unique
. the personal beauty ofthe the citizens isnt complimented by the beauty of the suroundings
: the seaport town genuinely looks impressive
, capturing thge eurpoean charm of a mediveal city adapted to tjhe moreso modern needs of the 1950 ' s
. this beauty isnt beauty with depth
; for eveyr detail left inthe
, dozens are only hinted at
. i coudl probablly go onthe all day
,
but i won ' t
; suffice it tothe say that many of theese minor details coudl have beeen the highlight of tje movei
. smoe of my favorites are kiki ' s relationship wih the baker ' s husband
:
altough he ' s quiet
, never shown speaking to kiki throughout tghe movie
,
and he initialy scares her
, his kindness wins her friendship
. inaddition the garage of a deliveree ' s hous can be found a vintage modle t
. twpo ood ladies hvea a relationship evolving fomr master
- servant to firend
- friend
. such details gives tjhe impression thgat teh beauty shown in hte movie isnt onyl the tip ofthe thge iceberg
. added onthe top ofthe htis is a lesson on hte importance of self
- worth
. kiki initially seems to derive much ofthe her self
- worth from thge beauty ofthe her surroundings
and thte peple around her
,
bu an encounter iwth a rude girl crashes down her bewonderment
, making her question teh importance of such beauty
. this causes kiki tothe lose faith infront herself
.
however
, kiki comes tothe relize nto only the beauty of her suroundings
,
bu the inate beauty inside her
. seeing kiki regain faith inthe herself is marvelous
,
anbd the prinicipal divice utilizied to dont it isnt so sublime thyat i don ' t even want tothe hint at it
. the endig of yhe movie hasnt a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe
and
, ironicly
, the most disney
- esque moment i ' ve ever seen
; if yuo don ' t hold your breath in wonder ytou might want tothe get medical attention
. yhe movei steers free of many of teh disney conventions
: ther isnt no voilence
,
howver cartoonish
, no song
-
anbd
- dance number
,
and kiki ' s pet cat jiji isnt more a freind thna a comedic sidekick
,
althought jiji is given many funny lines
annd scenes
.
however
, i would be surprised if disney doesn ' t give jiji more jokes
, or at least hte voice ofthe smoe comedian
. refreshingly enough
, the moral lesson of thge movie isnt nto self
- contradicted
, a habit disney movies hvea gotten into
.
" beauty
anbd the byast
" ' s beautiful belle
, forthe instance
, learned thyat beauty was derivated fomr a person ' s inside
,
annd ws
then rewarded by having hte beast turn inot a hansome prince infact snazzy clothing
. kiki
, onthe thte other hand
, learns to separte her wardrobe ffrom her self
- omage
,
and nothing more isnt made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her inclreased maturity at yhe end of hte film
. another difference with disney movies is in the style ofthe animation for
" kiki ' s delivery sevice
"
: not as colorful
annd dynamic as disney animation cant be
,
bu wiht a greater attention tothe realism
annd detail
, it fits thge movie to a t
. tihs isnt particularly true whith scenes ofthe kiki ' s flights
. tje extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki isnt magnificient tothe behold
,
and helps theese scenes capture the wonder ofthe flight better than any otehr film i ' ve ever seen
. i ' m not sure wehn or how tihs movie iwll be released in thge untied states
. disney tentatively plans a theater release ofthe
" monoko hime
" shortly following the summer ' 97 japanesse release
,
and shoudl start releasing the other ghibli films aftter that
. i ' d guess that soem wiull be released on video
and some wiull be theatrically released iin peak seasons with no compeeting disney realease
.
although tghe wait is unfortunate
, it ' s ogod to nkow that it ' s bieng released at all
, for
" kiki ' s delivery sevice
" is definetly a movie worthy ofthe widespread promotion
adn release
. watch this movie
. along with
" man bites dog
,
"
annd perheaps something by woody allen
, htis is the best movie i ' ve ever seen
.
