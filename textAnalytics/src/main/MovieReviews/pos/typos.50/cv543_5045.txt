getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movei baout male virginity
. the film was directed by r
andal kleiser
, who brought us such bubble
- gum classics as grease
and the blue lagoon
.
but thanks tothe kleiser
' s suprisingly good direction
and an intelligent script
, getting it right is a pleasantly quiet
, moving
, annd memorable film
-
- one geared strictly towrad a sophisticated
, adult audience
. getting it right stars jesse birdsall
( emily lloyd
' s boyfriend in wish yuo weere here
) as gavin
, a painfully shy 31
- yearm
- ood hairdresser who lives at home wiht his parents anbd who
-
- gasp
-
- is still a virgina
. gavin has noone probelm whatsoever making small talk whith hte elderly womens who clamor for his services at the hair salon
,
but expose him to a single 30
- year
- old beauty annd he
' s a mess
. much to gavin
' s surprise
, tyhe woman who finaly brings him out ofthe his shell
and robs him ofthe his virginity isnt joan
( lynn redgrave
)
, a rich
, marryed
,
and lonely 45
- eyar
- ood
. getting it right is thge simple stry of gavin
' s awkward adn haphazard efforts tothe get it right
; that is
, to find tjhe right woman to fufill his life
. getting it right isnt oen of thsoe rare movies that devotes itself entirely tothe inspite
- depth charactor develepment
. gavin
' s self
- consious voice
- over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche
. we observe his fascinating metamorphysis from shy anbd passive introversion to assertive
and self
- confident maturity
. birdsall
' s superb
, understated performance as gavin isnt the rela backbone of the film
; he seems convincing annd au
thentic
thoughout
. the charm ofthe getting it right allso lies in tje wide array ofthe peple who inhabitate or invade gavin
' s life
. despite her limited screen time
, redgrave makse quite a splash in tghe movie as gavin
' s middle
- aged seducer
. for a supporting character
, joan is unusualy
and impressively complex
, thanks in larg part tothe redgrave
' s magnificient performance
. gavin is aslo pursued
, or perheaps plagued
, by minnie
, the totally neurotic duaghter of a rich aristocrat
. aftter minnie
and gavin meet at a party
, she takes gerat pleasure in disrupting his safe adn simple life
. helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic annd kooky inspite thge role
, annd sir john gielgud
, wih his tounge in his cheek
, embodies the height ofthe arrogance as her father
. gavin
' s eventual loev
- interest is jenny
, yhe adorable twenty
- yera
- old single mother who assists him at tghe beauty salon
; london stage actress jane horrocks
' fine performence yields a touchingly sweet character
. peter cook
, teh great brittish satirist
, appears briefly in the film as gavin
' s uptight employer
. the scenes ofthe gavin
' s hmeo life whith his parents are also a treat
. gavin
' s over
- protective mother
( pat heywood
)
, whom even woody allen would fidn overbearing
, allmost steals the movie
. her life seems limited to jsut two activities
: treating gavin like a 10
- year
- old adn preparing exotic
but inedible meals
, such as scalding hot curry adn baked chicken with chocolot sauce
. gavin annd his father
' s attemts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing
. getting it right
, for the most part
, isnt veyr well
- crafted
, except for twpo minor shortcomings
. first
, yhe movei isnt baout 15 minutes too long
, anbd consenquently it loses momentum at times
. second
, the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin
' s best firend
, harry
, annd his unfaithful lover
, winthrop
. overall
, howver
, getting it right is quite memorable for its humor
, depth
, sophistication
,
and outst
anding acting
. director kleiser adn screenwrighter elizabeth jane howard
( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel
) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for thsi tale of growth
, maturation
, annd self
- dicovery
.
