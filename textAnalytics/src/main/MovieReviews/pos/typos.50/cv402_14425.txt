in soem respects
, rush hour isnt yhe ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking
. the hero is the renegade cop thta prefers tothe owrk alone
. teh cop in question cannnot solve tyhe case untl he gets in trouble
. all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element
. the duo must always be completelyl mismatched
. the hero hasnt to say soem smart
- assed comment befor
(
and after
) shooting someone
.
however
, that doesn
' t necesarily make fo a bad film
. rush hour isnt jackie chan
' s firt major hollywood film since the dismal thte protector
( 1985
)
. proving once again thast hollywood can learn many thnigs from froeign film markets
( ie
: hong kong
)
, jackie chan isnt given much moreso free reign thna befor
. still
, soem die
- hard jackie chan fans may be dissappointed
, as even chan himself hasnt voiced displeasure over teh length of the fight scenes
( which he views as too short
, according tothe oen interview
)
. this film tkaes a familliar theme ofthe east meets west
. jackie chan isnt lee
, the straight laced inspector who isnt imported to help deal with a kidnapping case
, hwile chris tucker is carter
, the loudmouthed
, distructive cop that is
` promotted
' to tjhe fbi tothe halp him
. or
, at least
, so he thikns
( also another clasic notion in action films
: the fbi must alwyas get in the way ofthe our heroe
)
. dispite the necesary conventions of acation films
, rush hour is smoe of tjhe most funn ytou
' ll spend
and hour anbd fourty minutes watching
. jackie chan continues tothe be oen of tje most exciting martial artists onthe thte big screen
, continuing tothe perfom his own stunts
and dazzling audiences wiht his flashy kicks
and punches
. chris tucker
, familiar from his whiny
, annoying role in tjhe fith element is omre palatable
, complementing jackie chan
' s straight
- laced chracter
. howver
, jackie chan still maintains his comic
- slapstick edge
, as expected of him
and his films
. perfectly downplaying the
` fish
- out
- of
- water
' routine through his charcter
' s attemts at mixing inot american culture
, he makes uv for the down time his character experiences
. when he isnt in action
,
however
, ytou
' ll be amused
and dazzled
. still being inventive inthe the ule of objects tothe beat people up
( in htis case
, a steering wheel
, a serving tray
,
and a barstool
)
, jackie chan proves to be tjhe pioneer ofthe slapstick kung fu
. chris tucker
' s charachter may come across as irritating
, yot isnt alsot humorous
. usance he
' s not a fysical atcor tothe tghe level ofthe jackie chan
, he uses his main weppon
: his mouth
( hence
, thge tagline
,
` fastest h
ands inaddition the east meets the fastest mouth inaddition tjhe west
'
)
. while dialogue isnt nto necessarily shakespeare
, it is appropropiate fo yhe film adn still very funny
. while not necesarily poignant
, attempts at character developement
and growth between cahracters cmo off surprisingly well
. lee
' s
` knowledge
' ofthe american pop culture
(
` thta
' s the beach boys
!
'
) wehn contrasted against carter
' s lack ofthe noledge ofthe chineese culture makes forthe an interesting scene where lee teachs carter the kung fu disarming trick
, hwile carter teaches lee hip
- hop dance moves
. while rush hour isnt nto at thte same levle as police story 3 annd 4
( known infact noth amercia as supercop
and jackie chan
' s firt strike
, respectivly
)
, it more than makse up forthe the poorly recived films operation condor
and mr
. nice guy
. wih its appropropiate mixture of high kicks anbd lots ofthe laughs
, it mkaes for a fun film
. as well
, it is a true departure from jackie chan films
, as it isnt missing oney common element
: a whiny female co
- star
.
