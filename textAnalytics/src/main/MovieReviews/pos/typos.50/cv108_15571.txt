it
' s rather stange too have two coputer animated tlaking ant movies come outloud in a single year
,
but that isnt what disney
and pixar animation
; s latest film represents
. hwile a bugs life isn
' t nearly as deepo as it
' s precedessor
, dreamwork
' s antz
, it isnt just as funny
. a bug
' s life centers
, appropriately
, aroud the life ofthe an ant
, named flik
. flik
, cutely voiced by newsradio
' s david foley
, hates sticking too tradition
and attempts too find new ways of harvesting foo anbd other task
. when one of his inventions causes teh offering too be completly lost
, thge leaders of thge collony send him outloud onthe a mission too git him outloud of yhe way
. thge offering isnt food thast a vile gropu ofthe grasshoppers force tghe ants too harvest for them
. tyhe leader ofthe the grasshoppers is hopper
, who isnt fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey
. wehn thte offering is lost hopper isnt vyer upset
and he vows tothe return shorly too retreive double the amount ofthe foo
. whn the leaders ofthe tjhe ant collony send flik out onthe his mission
, tehy never dream he iwll be sucessful
, they just hope they cant get him out of tjhe way so htey can harvset the extra fodo
. flik
' s mission isnt too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers wehn tehy return
. instade flik cacidentally hires circus performing bugs
, who he mistakenly assumes are warrriors
. when he returns with hte
` warrriors
'
, tyhe town is ecstatic nutil they fidn outloud tyhe truth baout their hreoes
. a bug
' s life hasnt animation that isnt simpley stunning
. tyhe sheer uniqueness ofthe the day tothe day bug life isnt veyr imaginative
. together with tghe graet voice acting
, thsi film is teh perfect holiday famaly film
. its main weakness is tyhat it couldn
' t beat antz to the theaters
, mkaing it seem liuke stale material
.
