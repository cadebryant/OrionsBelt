" shanghai noon
" isnt just ogod fun
. the chemistry vetween the casted isnt remarkable
. the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels ofthe the film
. jackie
' s peformance is as ogod as anytying he
' s done before
. he
' s nto called on to dont much acting here
, as yhe character isnt nto written with any depth
.
but jackie
' s natural karisma shines thru
,
and his comic timing is so perfect
, both physically annd
( suprize
) verbally thta once agian he comm
ands the screen whenever he isnt onthe
. owen wilson
, last seen inwhich tje embarassing remake of
" the haunting
"
, gives a ogod natured performence as roy o
' bannon
. his innocence is refreshing
and funn
. a bad guy thgat
' s not realy bad
. his scenes iwth jackie are smoe ofthe the best bits ofthe comic dueling since martin anbd lewis
. lucy liu as princess pei pei is given littel to dont inspite yhe scirpt
, bu for a change does nto play a nymphet or some otehr deviant
. hte character isnt a noble woman of status annd wealth
, bu finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment
. hte rest ofthe tjhe performances are all broadly drawed comic performances
. nothing here is realistic
, mind you
.
" shanghai noon
" isnt first
and foremost a glight
, jovial film
.
and the performances match taht stlye iwth ease
. the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous
. using calgary
, alberta as the prime location
. mr
. mindel is able to create a lush
, romantic western fiel tothe teh film
. nothing here really looks liuke nevada
, bu tje locations are so beautifuly shot annd staged
, tyhe film can be looked upon as a loving tri
bute tothe ealier films of the genre
. adn as such
, the scirpt by alfred gough
and miles millar plays fast annd loose with history
, bu with reverance to past films
. homage to such films as
" high noon
"
( obviously
)
,
" red river
" annd most notabley
"
butch cassidy
& the sundance kid
" all bring a sense of nostalgia tothe tjhe film
. it isnt a comforting expereince
. at a time when the western is consdiered either ood hat or irrelevant
, here is a film tht embraces those ood attitudes
and
( dabree i say
) clich
? s anbd manages to make them palatable
and refreshing
. here is a film that isnt nto contemptuous of thte genre
. htis isnt teh purest
" horse opera
" sicne the days ofthe george o
' brian or john wayne
. directer tom dey has crafted a loving tri
bute tothe hollywood
' s past
. iin this
, his firt film mr
. dey shows both a love ofthe chracter
and of craftsmanship thast is refreshing tothe see
. nothing here really st
ands out
, or takes one
' s attension away fomr tje tsory or acation
. adn that is as it shoud be
, wehn jackie chan is your star
. anbd what ofthe the acation annd stunts
. well
, hwile nto uv tothe a levle ofthe
" drunken master 2
" or any of jackie
' s hong kong films
,
" shanghai noon
" is miles ahead of anything jackie hasnt done inthe an american film befoer
. his timing
, choreography
, anbd creativity are still as sharp as ever
. jackie even gets to recreate a faw scenes fomr his earlier films
( obvious tothe thsoe ofthe us tath hve seen those films
,
but refreshingly fun forthe those unfamiliar
)
. finaly jackie can honestly sday
, tath he hasnt made an u
. s
.
, his way
and incorporating his sytle
. to sum up
,
" shanghai noon
" isnt a fun summer confection
. not too heavy
and not too ight
. a fun
and intertaining film that the whole family cxan enjoy
( parents be advised ther are scenes ofthe smoking
, drunkenness annd peyote use
)
. an enjoyable adn charming film tath cant
and iwll be enjoyed agian adn agian
.
