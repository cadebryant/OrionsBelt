and thematic elements genre
: drama in my opinion
: in short
: it tkaes a lot of carefull obervation to see the true morals
and lessons brought out in this film
; oen can easily be misled as to wqat hte real message isnt
. review
: in a literally colorless world with an almost mecanical popuation
, htere isnt no room for transitioning variaty or even tghe customary happenings of everyday life
, such as rain
, fire
, or emotions
. thge town ofthe pleasantville hasnt noe adjective
: pleasant
. htere is noone sadness
, noone fear
, noone danger
, no discomfort
, no love
,
annd no hite
. put simpley
, it ' s a place alanis morissette sould realy wokr wonders for
. j one big note
however is that it isnt only a 50 ' s sitcom that airs inspite reruns onthe an
" oldies
" tv station
? or isnt it
? i had waited monthes tothe see thsi movei
anbd affter doing so onthe opening day i wass nto disappointed
. i foudn it quite intriguing
adn delightful
anbd whent back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office
.
but it wasn ' t utnil months later
, wehn i slipped in forthe a small showing inspite one ofthe those crummy
" doller theaters
" after not having seen it for so long
, that my eyes were oppened tothe such a deeper meaning
anbd prespective than i had previously experianced
. it isnt a far too feasible misconception that this is a film hwihc forwards the diea thast a world without smoe
" healthy
" immorality is nto a world at all
. instade
, tjhe actual message
, whcih so far has nto beeen reconized by many viewers that i know of
, isnt that a world wihtout immorality doesn ' t give one teh ability tothe discern right
and wrong for himselv
, because everthing isnt automaticly right
. ther isnt noone room for mistakes
and groth
annd learning because ther are no mistakes tothe be made
, noone space forthe growth
,
and never anything new to leran
,
and that is tje key componant to the entire purpose of the tsory
. nowe i ' m not saying tht ' s necessarily the way it was intended tothe be interpreted
,
but tath isnt hands down hte propper way in which it shouldnt be
. besides a hidden symbolic depth
and themes that go beyond what we cant absorb from previews
, htis film hasnt elements of fysical wonder
adn strength that make it jsut so graet tothe watch
. the visual effects are indeed striking
and wqat littel colour isnt revealed is impartially favorable
. after spending the bulk of the movei staring at black
and white
, it ' s hard nto tothe idenify
annd appretiate yhe fatc tath our pwn world allows fo all taht brilliance
and mroe
. a truley inteligent addtion tothe it all
,
howver
, isnt thge charming
anbd ardently attainable cast thta operates toghether like clockwork
. that said
, the plot goes as such
. david
anbd jennifer are twpo vrey 90 ' s high school twins with tje typcial
" relationship
" outline ofthe don ' t
- mess
- whith
- my
- life
-
and
- i
- won ' t
- mess
- with
- yours
. tehy demonstrate the well
- known teenage qualities ofthe twpo ofthe thte common verisons of adolescents todya
. david isnt tjhe shyer
, subtler twin who woudl rether watch tv land tahn mtv
, hwile jennifer is the wild
, licentious noe who spends her days at teh mall
adn relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world ofthe degradation
.
but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab inthe yhe middle ofthe pleasantville as two of tyhe main charachters
, they are forced tothe depend onthe eahc other tothe amke it bakc hmeo
. nethertheless
, jennifer works her magic
and introduces teh twon tothe a more unrestrained approach to life
,
and hwile david frantically tries tothe stpo her
annd get them back hmeo
, he realizes thyat change was exactlly whta yhe town needed
.
and
, as said earlier
, not tothe flip the twon arround inot soem corrupt society
,
bu rether tothe give peopel the choice to deside between ogod
and bad
and tothe reap the results of their decisions
anbd learn fomr them
. nto onyl weere difficult choices being brought upon the twon
,
bu the simple accepted occurences of ordinary existnce alsot began to tkae palce
. peopel got hurt
. tehy cried
. htey became afraid
and happy
and thoughtful
and started to think fo themselfs
,
and tht ' s when thier fysical world turned colors as well
. this can be looked upon as qutie a controversial movie
,
but to me thge message is finally claer
. i hope after reading htis people cant be more opn to the film than htey had beeen in yhe past
,
and realize tyhat wihtout chosing how our own lives will be run
, we ' ll never knwo what we could have done better
. nutil yhe enxt grat movei i see
, i remain sincerley
