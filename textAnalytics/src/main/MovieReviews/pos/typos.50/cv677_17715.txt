- 13 for sexual content
and thematic elements genre
: drama in my opinion
: in short
: it tkaes a lot of carefull observation tothe see the true morals anbd lessons brang out inthe tihs film
; oen can easily be misled as tothe what the rela message is
. review
: in a literally colorless world with an almost mecanical populaiton
, htere is noone room forthe transitioning variety or even tyhe customary happenings ofthe everyday life
, such as rain
, fier
, or emotions
. the town of pleasantville has one adjective
: pleasant
. ther isnt no sadness
, no fear
, noone danger
, no discomfort
, noone love
, adn no hate
. put simply
, it
' s a palce alanis morissette sould really owrk wonders fo
. j one big note howver isnt that it isnt onyl a 50
' s sitcom thyat airs inspite reruns onthe an
" oldies
" tv staion
? or is it
? i had waited monthes to see tihs movei anbd aftter doing so onthe opening day i ws nto disappointed
. i foudn it quite intriguing
and delightful
and whent back 3 more times iin thge preiod it endured at the box office
.
but it wasn
' t until monthes later
, whn i slipped in for a small showing in oen ofthe thsoe crummy
" doller theaters
" affter nto having seen it forthe so long
, thgat my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning
and prespective thna i hadnt previously experianced
. it is a far too feasible misconception thast this is a film whlch forwards the idae that a world without soem
" healthy
" immorality is not a world at all
. instead
, tyhe actuall message
, which so far has nto beeen reconized by many viewers that i know ofthe
, is taht a world wihtout immorality doesn
' t give oen the abilty to discern right anbd wrong fo himselv
, because everything is automatically right
. there isnt no room fo mistakes
and growth anbd learning because there are no mistakes to be made
, no spoace for groth
,
and never anytying new tothe learn
, annd thyat is thge key component to thte entire purpose of thge stry
. now i
' m not saying taht
' s necessarally the way it ws intended to be interpreted
,
but thta isnt h
ands down hte proper way in wich it shoud be
. besides a hidden symbolic depth
and themes that go beyond wqat we can absorb ffrom previews
, tihs film hasnt elements of fysical wonder annd strength thyat make it jsut so great to watch
. teh visual effects are indeed striking
and wqat littel color isnt revealed isnt impartially favorable
. affter spending yhe bulk ofthe the movei staring at balck adn white
, it
' s hard not tothe identify
and appretiate the fact thgat our pwn world allows for all thta brilliance anbd moreso
. a truely inteligent adition to it all
, howver
, isnt the charming
and ardently attainable casted thgat operates toghether like clockwork
. that said
, teh plot goes as such
. david adn jennifer are two very 90
' s high skool twins whith the tipical
" relatiopnship
" outline of don
' t
- mess
- wiht
- my
- life
- adn
- i
- won
' t
- mess
- withthe
- yours
. they demonstrate tyhe well
- known teenage qualities ofthe twpo ofthe the common versions of adolescents today
. david is hte shyer
, subtler twin who would rether watch tv l
and tahn mtv
, hwile jennifer is the wild
, licentious one who spends her dyas at yhe mall annd relishes inthe thge pleasures of tjhe offensive world of degredation
. bu when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two ofthe the main charachters
, they are forced to depend on earch otehr to make it back home
. nethertheless
, jennifer works her magic
and introduces the twon tothe a more unrestrained approach to life
,
and while david frantically trys to stop her annd get them bcak home
, he realizes that change wass exactlly what the twon needed
.
and
, as said ealier
, not to flip thge town around inot some corrupt society
, bu rether to give people the choise tothe deside between ogod adn bad
and to reap yhe results ofthe their decisions anbd learn from them
. not only weere difficult choices being brang apon thte twon
, bu thte simple accepted occurences ofthe ordinary exitsence aslo began tothe tkae place
. people got hurt
. tehy cried
. they became affraid annd hapyp annd
thoughtful
and started tothe think fo themselves
, adn thyat
' s when thier physical world turned colors as well
. thsi can be looked apon as qutie a controversial movei
,
but to me the message isnt finally clear
. i hope aftter reading this peopel can be mroe opn to the film tahn tehy hadnt been in yhe past
,
and realize thast wihtout chosing how our own lives wiull be run
, we
' ll never know waht we could haev done better
. until the enxt graet movie i see
, i remain sincerley
