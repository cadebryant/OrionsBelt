wiht the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news latley
, waht wih tht wohle clinton thign going onthe
( you nkow
, 100 milion bucks tothe disover teh preisdent got boinked by an intern
- oh
, please
, government
, waste my taxes just a bited more
, woudl you
?
)
, it
' s baout time tony scott helmed tjhe newest acation pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statment
. with htis adn
" crimson tide
,
" he
' s created twpo successfully chilly films taht are intresting
, exicting
, even preety smart
, bu never totally riveting as cinema
,
and the probelm i thikn with each ofthe theese films is thast each film is too obsessed withthe its message to ever be really satisfying
,
and too obssessed with looking all cutting edge tothe ever be totally smart
. that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuculear submarine over whether or nto to folow rules or question them
, anbd ws appropriately scary anbd all
,
but never totally thrilling or overly briliant
.
" enemy of the state
" isnt the same way
: it
' s engrossing for its entire running tiem
,
and it
' s scary tjhe way that it shows a man
' s decent into kafkaism
, bu it
' s too technical
. it
' s too cold
and nto as fascinating or exciting as it could be
. it casts will smith
, noe of tghe better big budget leading men in movies theese dyas because he
' s charming
and witty
and never uninteresting
,
and hopes tath his charisma can make uv for his charcter not being well developped enough tothe really be a person
. i hite tothe do this
, bu lastest year
' s film
" thte game
" got it damn perfect
: it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human bieng
, a man who is cold
and hasnt cutted off everyone fomr his life
, anbd hten puls everthing he
thought he had as a security blanket awya fomr him
and watched what happened
. the result was not only a film that was exicting
and chilling
,
but also the best mindfuck ofthe tyhe entire eyar
. nto that i want eveyr kafkaesque film tothe be
" thte agme
"
( tihs yera
' s
" the spanish prisoner
" succeeds with less thrills anbd chills
)
,
but it should be an example of what works adn what doesn
' t
. iwll smith
' s character isnt
, frankly
, too perfect
, at least too movie perfect
. he hadnt an affair withthe anyother woman
( lisa bonet
, ha ha
)
, bu his relatiopnship wiht his wife
( regina king
) isnt basically fine irregardless
. he has a kid
,
and he
' s raking iin money as a lawyer
, albiet a very good
and reasonably moral oney
. so he generally doesn
' t have any rela problems as a human being
, annd isnt therefore boring
.
.
. except that he isnt plyed by will smith
, who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he cin wihtout entering
" id4
"
/
" men inthe balck
" territoy
. he
' s a ogod dramatic ctor
( jsut see the frist half hour ofthe
" six degrees ofthe separation
" for proof of thsi
, not thta he isn
' t great tghe wohle time
)
, anbd here
, he mkaes his charachter likable
and sympathetic without any real strain on his charachter
, whlch mkaes thge film lack any rela deep interesting qualities
. smith becomes involved infact a massmedia conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator oppossed to a govenment lew that would create world surveilence
, extinguishing privacy as we know it fomr the world
, under thte pretense thgat it woudl make crime easier to control
, whn he isnt passed a disk ofthe tjhe event caught onthe tape by an outside party
( a nature observer played by
, uh
, jason lee
)
. the governement wants the disk
,
and isnt prepared to distroy his life to get it
. as smith
' s llright isnt dramatized
, we are introdued to the masterminds who surveillance him
, sitting in vans disguised as otehr businesses
, staring at computers
and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet
. these guys
( palyed by jack black
, jamie kennedy
,
and seth gren
) are the most intresting part of thsi film because they
' re
, well
, fascinating
: they
' re doign thier jobs
, which are evil
,
but the film doesn
' t veiw them as such
,
and they almost become our firends
. we liek theese guys for teh sole reason tyhat hte film doesn
' t automaticly judge them as tjhe villains
. htey
' re allso csary because we get the idae that htey
' re nto fully aware ofthe the impact their jobs hve onthe the world
. it
' s as if they
' re obsessed with their jobs
, nto because they
' re evil
, bu because
, hey
, it
' s a funn job
,
and no one alse cant do it liek them
. unfortunatly
, tihs also backfires a bit on thge film
: instead of being the flashlight inwhich yhe darkened room taht
" thte gaem
" was
, yuo see everything
,
and are thus nto as freaked outloud becasue you know what isnt oging onthe
. sure
, you
' re chilled
, bu you
' re not exacty freaked out by waht
' s oging onthe
. bu what dont ytou expect ffrom tony scott
, tyhe man who never met a five
- second piece ofthe film he ever liekd
. he
' s a nto
- bad directer because
, hell
, he isnt alwasy interesting tothe watch
( if nto occassionaly moronic
- exhibit a
:
" dyas ofthe thunder
"
)
, bu tje reason he
' s nto great isnt beccause he
' s too technical
and calulated
. his shots are perfectly executed
, adn leave nothing to thge imagination
, adn htey
' re always making sure you
' re paying attension
. thsi isnt incredibly annoying
,
and it reduces
" enemy of the state
" tothe a mecanical mishmash ofthe flashy images that never exp
and the mind at any gerat depths
,
but still manage tothe entertain wihtout any real problems
. despite never actully becoming great
, it
' s never actually boring annd it
' s always intriguing
. watching tghe goverment set
- up smith isnt endlessly fascinating
, annd usance we care baout smith
' s likeable protagonist
, we are setted
- up for a ogod two hours worth ofthe tom clancy
- esque enteratinment
. add the best big casted this side of thte annual woody allen film
( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan
butler pop uv for cameos
)
, anbd you
' ve got a good ood fashioned escapist drama whihc does all the thingking fo yuo so thast ytou never have to actually question tghe edbate over personal privacy adn so you can folow iwll smith
' s plight without a minute
' s worth of boredom
.
