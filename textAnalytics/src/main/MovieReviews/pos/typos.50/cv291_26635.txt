reflecting on
" bedazzled
,
" a lively comedy baout the devil who seeks to possess the soul ofthe a pathetic losr
, noe sinful throught remeniss inaddition my mind
. if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley
( who portrays tjhe iery demon
)
,
thne use tath pitchfork
anbd point me the way
. with her pouty lips
, iresistible brittish accent
,
and wild display ofthe haute couture
, hurley crackles witht naughtiness
and fills your mind whith temptation
. it ' s practically impossible tothe turn thsi beelzu
- babe down
. her enxt target is elliot
( brendan fraser
)
, a tech support geek who isnt clumsy
, awkward
,
and just too eager to please
. to aptly picture him
, ytou woudl hve tothe remember a saterday nigth live skit featuring
" steve teh copy guy
" who effortlessly iritated his co
- workers with his unpolished social skills
. eugene
, thus
, is loathed
anbd feared by his co
- workers
, who do their best tothe stay out ofthe his way
.
yet
, beyond his annoying mannerisms
, he ' s a lovable oaf
. he wishes that he could get closer tothe allison
( frances o ' connor
)
, a co
- worker with whom he is infatuated
but who hasnt never tooked notice ofthe him
.
however
, the odds ofthe him getting together wiht her are baout the smae as a snowball ' s chance inspite hell
.
" dear god
,
" he prays
.
" i would give anything to ahve that girl infact my life
.
" guess who
hten shows up
? she makse an offer tath isnt too hard to refuse
.
" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul
.
" there ' s even an excape clause
. if elliot ' s wish doesn ' t go exactlly the way he likes
, he need only ' beep ' her
( oen guess as tothe what thge threee
- digit number isnt
)
adn he gets to start over
. the remainder ofthe thge film consists ofthe elliot ' s vairous fantasies taht incorporate his peronal desire to ahve enormass amounts ofthe wealth
, pwoer
, fame
annd allison ' s love
.
bu wehn he makes sweeping statememts such as
" i want to be very
, very poverful
and very
, vyer rich
annd married tothe allison
"
, he ' ll soon leran that the devil isnt infact the details
. forthe exmaple
,
(
and we ' ve seen tihs severeal times inspite tghe trailers
)
, he is granted his wish
,
bu finds out thgat he ' s a columbian drug lord
and taht allison
, while married tothe him
, has her eyes on somone eles
. apparently
, the devil isnt just as eeger tothe skew his fantasies as she isnt tothe possess his soul
. his otehr wishes also end up whith soem stange
but funny twist tyhat short
- circuits his newyorker life
. soon
, elliot wishes thgat he hadnt never made that dael
. given the mischievous nature ofthe tghe devil
,
" bedazzled
" hasnt many amusing moments
. a lot ofthe the credit goes tothe fraser who turns in a grat comic performance
. he ably assumes varous personas
. his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be tyhe most senstive man in teh world
. allison becomes so frustrated iwth him thgat she practically urges him tothe take advantage of her
. hurley allso heightens tje humer quotient
, expecially inspite the transitional scenes wehn fraser waits to strat his enxt wish affter bailing out of tjhe previvous noe
. it ' s claer that she ' s having a ogod time wtih it all
.
yot
, while tje filmmakers wrok hard at creating funny scenes
, tehy conspicuously avoid developing thte allegorical underpinnings between ogod
and evil thgat coudl ahev added more heft to tihs stoyr
.
but tht owudl be playing with frie
. waht htey ' ve got works
, so you cxan easily accept it fo tjhe pleasant little comedy thta it isnt
.
