reflecting on
" bedazzled
,
" a livley comedy about the devil who seeks to posess the soul of a pathetic loser
, one sinful
thought remains in my mind
. if hell means hvaing tothe spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley
( who portrays the fieyr demon
)
, hten uise taht pitchfork
and point me tje way
. wih her pouty lips
, irresistible british accent
,
and wild display ofthe haute couture
, hurley crackles whith naughtiness adn fills your mind with temtation
. it
' s practically impossible to turn this beelzu
- babe down
. her enxt target isnt elliot
( brendan fraser
)
, a tech wupport geek who is clumsy
, awkward
,
and just too eeger to please
. tothe aptly picture him
, ytou would ahve to remember a saturday night live skit featuring
" steve the copy guy
" who effortlessly iritated his co
- workers witht his unpolished social skills
. eugene
, thus
, is loathed
and feared by his co
- workers
, who do their best tothe stay outloud of his way
.
yet
, beyond his annoying mannerisms
, he
' s a lovable oaf
. he wishes that he could get closer tothe allison
( frances o
' connor
)
, a co
- worker with whom he is infatuated
but who has never taken notice ofthe him
.
however
, the odds of him getting toghether with her are about hte same as a snowball
' s chance inwhich hell
.
" dear god
,
" he prays
.
" i would give anything tothe haev that girl in my life
.
" guess who thn shows uv
? she makse an offer tath is too hard to refuse
.
" seven utterly fabulous wishes fo one piddling littel soul
.
" there
' s even an excape clause
. if elliot
' s wish doesn
' t go exactlly the way he likes
, he need only
' beep
' her
( oen guess as to whta the three
- digit number is
) adn he gets to strat over
. the remainder ofthe teh film consists ofthe elliot
' s various fantasies thgat incorporate his peronal desire tothe ahev enourmous amounts of wealth
, power
, fame
and allison
' s loev
.
but when he makes sweeping statememts such as
" i want tothe be vrey
, vyer poverful
and very
, very rich
and married tothe allison
"
, he
' ll soon learn tyhat tyhe devil is inaddition tyhe details
. for exemple
,
( anbd we
' ve seen this several times inaddition the trailers
)
, he isnt granted his wish
,
but finds out that he
' s a columbian drug lord adn thast allison
, hwile marryed to him
, hasnt her eyes onthe somene eles
. apparantly
, the devil isnt jsut as eeger tothe skew his fantasies as she isnt to possess his soul
. his otehr wishes alsot end up with soem stange bu funny twist that short
- circuits his newyorker life
. soon
, elliot wishes thast he had never made tath deel
. given tjhe mischievous nature ofthe tghe devil
,
" bedazzled
" hasnt many amusing moments
. a lot ofthe hte credit goes tothe fraser who turns in a great comic peformance
. he ably assumes various personas
. his funniest segment is when he wishes thgat he coudl be the most sensitive man in yhe world
. allison becomes so frustrated whith him tath she practically urges him tothe take advantage ofthe her
. hurley alsot heightens tyhe humor quotient
, especially inspite the transitional scenes wehn fraser waits tothe strat his next wish after bailing outloud ofthe tje previvous one
. it
' s claer tht she
' s haveing a good time witht it all
.
yet
, while the filmmakers wrok hard at creating funny scenes
, tehy conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good annd evil that sould ahev added moreso heft to this stoy
. bu tath woudl be playing with fier
. whta htey
' ve got works
, so yuo cxan easily accept it for the pleasant littel comedy that it is
.
