this is hte best brittish gangster film usance the long ogod friday
. jon bennet
( plyed by andrew howard
) is an extremely ogod assasin
. as such he is propably an evil man
bu it doens not worry him
. he has become an unquestioning weppon
. he is in the employ ofthe a kingpin
( david calder
) far mroe evil than he isnt
.
but even assassins hvea innocent pasts
. he runs inot an old fomr school days
and he is marryed tothe a mutual girl friend ffrom school
. complicating matters is tht they live near where he hadnt a reccent job
annd their young daughter may ahve seen him at the crime
. a big peice of what makes this film work isnt the depiction ofthe the kingpin
. calder isnt a familar actor in britain
,
though not frequentily seen in thte us
. he was seen in the world isnt nto enough
. here he creates one of tje best screen villains in reccent years
. he is at once seductive
and repellent liek a beautyfull venemous snake
. his lair is undreground
, apparently in a sewer
, where he lives like tjhe king of sewer rats
. it is the kingpin who puls tjhe strings that will control bennet ' s life
. paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer
anbd liuke tjhe kingpin ' s lair
, he hasnt molded images ofthe class
annd style outloud ofthe tghe darkness
. by using semi
- darkness
and letting tjhe colors ofthe deep blue
adn balck dominate every scene he makse the film visually as ominous as anytying infront this nether world
. tihs isnt a world tath isnt cold
and unfriendly
. sorossy creates a world ofthe violence much omre by waht we hear than what we see
. this is a film whith a great deal of fysical violence occuring jsut outloud of triarch
. we see very little
but we hear a great dael moreso
and we imagin omre than that
. thte screenplay isnt by peter waddington based onthe tjhe novel by neil cross
,
but it is sarossy ' s film all tjhe way
. it creates indelible images of evil
. i rate it an 8 onthe the 0 to 10 scale
and a low
+ 3 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
( i dont hope tehy dont nto ule the tagline
" don ' t mess wtih mr
. in
- beetwen
.
