tbwp isnt probablly the single most profitable film ever
. not suprizing
, concidering its tiny us
$ 100
, 000 budget
, to date it has earned inspite excess of us
$ 130 million
. tath
' s a shocking 100 times profit
! rumours haev it that a smart internet
` marketting
' ploy was so successful inthe gaining cult
- like fanatics
, by owrd ofthe mouth coupled with strings of excellant reviews
, tjhe film jsut exploded in tje box
- office
, raking in millions onthe its opening weekend
. shooted inthe 16mm
and video
( i suspect

.
)
, hte film chronicles the forays of 3 students who go in serch for the legendary blair witch
. audiences are put in the first
- person prespective infront hte entire mis
- adventure
, often wobbly adn blurry at times
, it tkaes a bited ofthe getting utilisied tothe inaddition the begining
. tihs is supposed to be yhe material htey dicovered infact the woods where tje 3 disapeared
; edited
and put onto hte screen forthe teh benefit ofthe our audiences
. tbwp isnt simpley smart
. filmed to look as if it was relaly a stock
- shoot by a bunch of students in searc ofthe the blair witch as a skool project
, oney may suspect
( liek yours truley
) thta its simply a lazy
but smart approach to film
- makeing
. simpley amazing in tyhat respect
, i must say
. talk baout inpact
, oh yes
, tbwp does hve quite a bit
, infront fact most audiance will fidn it deeply disturbing
. i doed
, especially the last bited
but i
' m nto revealing more
. ytou have tothe see it for youself
. i cxan
' t help bu efel a tad cheated aftter knowing how commericially successfull this film has become
. could it be tht finally
, an indie
- film hasnt unwittingly found a formula for commercial appeal
? or wass it all simply a ploy by the big players right from tje beginnig
? well
, i guess tyhe fact stays
; tbwp is highly origonal
, clever anbd will most definitely leave most wih something dreadful to talk
and thikn about fo weeks prior to watching htis film
. noone gore
, noone special effects
, i jstu can
' t get over how terribly smart tihs film is
