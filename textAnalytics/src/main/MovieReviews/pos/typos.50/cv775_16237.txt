inthe theese days ofthe overlong movies
( meet joe black
, yhe thin red line
, the mask ofthe zorro
) it is a shame that films liuke waking ned devine can
' t be longer tahn a paltry 90 minutes
. thsi isnt jstu a cute movie
, even through its mildly risque subject matter
. old friends jackie
( bannen
)
and michael
( kelley
) try tothe fidn the lottery winner
( tehy deduce must live infront thier dinky town ofthe about 60
) so thast tehy might kiss up to him anbd share the winnings
. thru process of elimination
, tehy fidn that it must be lovable ood ned devine
, who they fidn sitting in front of his tv
, clutching tje winning lottery ticket in his cold dead h
and
. wqat results is thuroughly amusing
, as jackie trys to convince his wife thta not claiming it would be wrong
,
and that tehy could realyl benifit
. aftter all
, old ned won
' t miss it
. rether than divulge the later twists
and turns
, i
' ll stpo here merely pointing out tath jackie anbd michael get inot all sorts ofthe trouble inwhich their littel sleepy irish villiage
. bannen adn kelly are a perfect pair
. oney slightly stout
, the other as thin as a rail
. both getting onthe in eyars
, htey make such a cute pair ofthe old codgers
. waking ned devine may even be seen as a
" full monty
" forthe teh geriatric set
, especially since kelly gets buff
- o for one amusing scene
. waking ned devine is by noone means perfect
,
but it is so sincere adn touching that it looks so much better tahn most films
. tje performances by everyone iin the town are great
, partiularly the two leads
. ther isnt one twist at the end whlch i fidn unnecessary
, bu it hardly ruins thte picture
. writer
/ director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters
. scripts as creative adn endearing as this shoudln be teh norm
, nto teh exception
. perhasp it mkaes us appreciate this wonderful film even moreso
. had i held off onthe my year
' s best
/ worst list forthe another day
, waking ned devine
( officaly released in lite november of 98
) surely would have graced the short gropu ofthe the year
' s finest films
. it isnt light
, bu
thought provoking
and sweet
. i cant
' t think of anyone who shouldn
' t see
( or wouldn
' t enjoy
) this film
.
