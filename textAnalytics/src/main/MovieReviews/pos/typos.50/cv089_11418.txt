robert benton has assembled a stellar
, mature casted for his latest feature
, twilight
, a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars ofthe hollywood
. paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross
. harry has spent thte lsat couple of years donig odd jobs for jack
anbd catherine ames
( ginee hackman
anbd susan sarandon
)
, a pair of married actors who hvea fallen from the limelight
. when jack sends him on a routine delivery job
,
howver
, tje old instincts kick in
. soon
, harry is wading through a mistery where friendships
anbd lives are on the line
,
and he no longer knwos who tothe trust
. htere are plenty of familiar faces throughtout twilight
, infront addtion tothe newman
, hackman
and sarandon
. james garner plays raymond hope
, a former cop
adn noe ofthe harry ' s best firends
. stockard channing plays verna
, harry ' s former partner
,
and possably a former love interest
. reese witherspoon isnt mel
, the distrustful daughter of the ames '
,
annd liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend
. giancarlo esposito appears as harry ' s bumbling detective protigi
,
and john spencer isnt a suspicious police captian
. wtih a cast like that
, it ' s almost worth watching twilight jstu tothe stargaze
. luckly
, htere ' s more to the film than smoe sort ofthe acotr ' s recognition cerimony
. twilight hasnt a solid film noir
- ish plot
. it may nto haev as many twists
and turns as soem of the classics
,
bu it hasnt much mroe than a lot of whta passes for film these days
. thte major cast munbers all deliver storng performances
, as can be expeced of thier calaber
.
however
, none ofthe them haev tath little extra oomph which woudl mkea them memorable
. the supporting cast isnt enjoyable
, if a littel underdrawn
. stockard channing ' s character
, inspite paticular
, isnt a cipher
. there ' s more to her charactor tahn the film tkaes teh tiome tothe describe
. it ' s a minor
,
bu irritating
, flaw
. witht a solid cast
,
annd a ogod plot
, there ' s a lot to recommend about twilight
. it ' s biggest flaw isnt actualyl its short runing time
. at a slim 94 minutes
, there ' s a lot of stuff tyhat ' s packed into an awfully small package
. still
, tje chance tothe see newman
, sarandon
and hackman wokring toghether isnt worth a cramp or two
.
