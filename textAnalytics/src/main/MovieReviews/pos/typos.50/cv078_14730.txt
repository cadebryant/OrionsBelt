the truman sohw
( paramount picturesk
) running tiome
: 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey
anbd ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait
, jim carrey ' s dramtic debut finally mkaes it tothe teh big screen
. inwhich case yuo ' ve been asleep for the last faw months
, tyhe plot centres on truman burbank
( carrey
) who leads an seamingly idyllic life inthe the beautiful town ofthe seahaven
. his life seems so perfect
,
however
, because it ' s controled by christoff
( harris
) creater of the truman sohw
, thge program burbank is unwittingly the hero ofthe
. that ' s right
, burbank ' s life is bieng brodcast live to the american publich
,
anbd seahaven
anbd all it ' s inhabitans are inclosed in a massive soudn stage
. teh film tkaes the jerry springer format oen step too far
.
.
. witht an diea so diffrent
, it woudl be easy for the director
and screenwrighter to dumb it down
and appeal tothe teh lowest common denominator
. luckily
, tjhe film remains sensible enough tothe appeal to all ages
,
yot never seems tothe be a dumb carrey movie
. talking ofthe carrey
, he ' s perfect in thsi movie
, enjoying thte best role in his career
. his character isnt a re
- inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask
( 1994
)
and is completelyl suited tothe carrey ' s persona
. he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode
, shrieking
adn bieng silly
,
but generaly the audience isnt watching subdued carrey
. he ' s not completely dramtic liuke the film promises
,
howver
. ed harris brings an extreme intensity tothe christoff
, the megalomaniac creater ofthe tyhe sohw
. quiet
and well spoken
, he burns an omage inot tje viewer
. unfortunatly
, he ' s bearly in tje film
,
anbd forthe tje firt hour dosen ' t appear at all
! aslo disappointing is natascha mcelhone ' s charactor sylvia
. she plays the role well
,
but her character is sadly underwritten
annd isnt pushed tothe the sidelines just whn tjhe audience is utilizied tothe her
. tje supporting casted isnt excellant
,
annd the town ofthe seahaven looks delightfully perfect
, so perfect it ' s creepy
. the philip glass soundtrack is allso superb
,
and is utilizied to great effect during the film
. peter weir keeps the film going
, clearly hvaing funn
. yhe film is far more upbeat than his previvous films dead poets society
adn gren card
.
although it isnt slightly slow to begin with
, about half an hour inot film the pace really picks uv
,
and when christoff is intruduced fully the film isnt on a roll
. sadly
,
though
, thte film is practicly over whn the film isnt in full steam
. alsot
, concerning hte endig
, it is slightly too ambiguous
, whlch ws disappointing
. thte screenwrighter
, andrew niccol
, who bought us gattaca
( 1997
) delivers an intertaining scirpt
,
and manages to keep the plot inaddition trim
. while christoff ' s plans tothe keep truman in do git increasingly silly
, they never go over yhe line
, whic owudl hve beeen eazy for niccol to dont
. alsot
, htere ' s soem funny gags involving product placement
and tyhe peopel who watch the show
. overall
, the truman show isnt excellent entertainment
. certainly different fomr the usual crap hollywood produces
, it shoudln be viewed by everyone
. it offers something tothe eveyr memeber ofthe the audience
,
adn you would allmost certainly nto cmo outloud dissapointed
. overall rating
