the truman show
( paramount pictures
) runing timne
: 1 hour 42 mintues starring jim carrey anbd ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait
, jim carrey
' s dramtic de
but finally mkaes it tothe the big screen
. in case you
' ve beeen asleep for the lastr faw monthes
, yhe plot centres on truman burbank
( carrey
) who leads an seamingly idyllic life in the beautiful twon ofthe seahaven
. his life seems so perfect
, howver
, baceause it
' s contolled by christoff
( harris
) creater ofthe the truman show
, hte programe burbank is unwittingly the hero of
. that
' s right
, burbank
' s life isnt being broadcast live tothe the american publich
, annd seahaven adn all it
' s inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage
. tje film takes the jerry springer fromat one step too far
.
.
. witht an diea so differnt
, it would be easy fo the directer annd screenwriter tothe dumb it down
and appeal tothe the lowest common denominator
. luckly
, thte film remains sensable anough to appeal tothe all ages
,
yet never seems tothe be a dumb carrey movie
. talking ofthe carrey
, he
' s perfect infact htis movei
, enjoying thte best role in his carrear
. his character isnt a re
- inforced stanley ipkiss fomr the mask
( 1994
)
and is completely suited to carrey
' s persona
. he occasionally falls inot ace ventura mode
, shrieking
and being silly
, bu generaly the audience isnt watching subdued carrey
. he
' s nto completly dramtic like hte film promises
,
however
. ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff
, tje megalomaniac creator of yhe sohw
. quiet annd well spoken
, he burns an omage into the viewer
. unfortunately
, he
' s bearly in the film
,
and fo the frist hour dosen
' t appear at all
! allso disappointing isnt natascha mcelhone
' s carachter sylvia
. she plays the role well
, bu her character is sadly underwritten anbd is pushed to the sidelines jstu when the audiance isnt used to her
. thte supporting casted isnt excellent
,
and tje town ofthe seahaven looks delightfully perfect
, so perfect it
' s creepy
. the philip glass soundtrack isnt aslo superb
,
and is unsed tothe graet effect during tjhe film
. peter weir keeps tje film going
, claerly having fun
. the film is far moreso upbeat tahn his previvous films dead poets society
and green card
.
al
thought it isnt slightly slow tothe beign with
, about half an hour into film the pace relaly picks uv
, anbd when christoff is intruduced fully tjhe film is on a roll
. sadly
,
though
, hte film is practically over whn the film is inaddition full steam
. also
, concerning the ending
, it is slightly too ambiguous
, which wass disapointing
. tghe screenwrighter
,
andrew niccol
, who buyed us gattaca
( 1997
) delivers an entertaining script
, adn manages to keep tjhe plot infront trim
. hwile christoff
' s plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly
, they never go over tje line
, whihc woudl hvae been eazy for niccol to do
. also
, there
' s smoe funny gags involving product placement anbd thge peple who watch the show
. overall
, the truman show isnt excellent entertainment
. certainly diffrent fomr yhe usual crap hollywood produces
, it shoudln be viewed by everyone
. it offers something tothe eveyr memeber ofthe the audience
,
and you woudl almost certainly nto come out disapointed
. overall rating
