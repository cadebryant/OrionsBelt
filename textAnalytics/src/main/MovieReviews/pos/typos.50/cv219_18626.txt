it must be tough to be a mob boss
. just ask paul vitti
( robert deniro
)
, a man who finds his job as masia head to be rether stress inducing
. i cant bleieve it
, too
- noe cant ' t even beign tothe fathom the turmoil he must go thru whn he ' s forced tothe choose betweeen an ice pik
, baseball bat or sledgehammer tothe torture victims with
. sufferring ffrom reaccurring panic attacks
, paul decides he needs tothe consult soem professional help
.
and who better thna billy crystal
. after appearing infront bottom
- ofthe
- the
- barrel flops
, father ' s day
and my giant
, crystal fianlly finds a reliable costar
annd some veyr promising material here
. palying vitti ' s private shrink
, the twpo vyer different stars strike an unorthodox
,
but interesting relatiopnship taht carries tihs enjoyable comedy on a steady wave ofthe laughs fomr start to finish
. casting robert deniro as paul vitti isnt something of an infront
- joke
, i think
. placed inwhich this mobster ' s shoes
, deniro gets to spoof charactors he hismelf palyed in films like the godfather
, part ii
and casino
. it ' s obvious he ' s haveing a lot of fun doign so
. the man behind tje camera is harold ramis
, whose credits inlcude ghostbusters
( as writter
and star
)
,
and his best directing affort
, the bill murray vehicule
, groundhog day
. ramis hasnt a knack for drawing laughs because he simply konws waht ' s funny
,
and here he manages tothe accentuate the strengths of nearly all tjhe actors
. the only charcter who weakens the payoff is crystal ' s bride
- to
- be
( lisa kudrow
)
. playing the smae dumbed
- down role as she doesnt in friends
, kudrow is amusing
,
but doesn ' t fit inot this comedy mold as well as the directer may have hoped
. tjhe supporting cast sparkles
. joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly
, vitti ' s pea brained right
- hand man
,
adn chazz palminteri is a sohw stopper playing a fellow mobster who ' s inaddition deseprate need ofthe tjhe definition ofthe
` closure '
. yhe movei manages tothe mantain consistant chuckles througout
, puting tjhe emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs thyat will have audiences grasping thier sides
. the situation is jsut too cute tothe resist
. it ' s unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand
.
but hey
, if you ' re in the mafia
, useing obscenities probably comes natuarlly
.
annd near tghe end
, seeing billy crystal attempt to walk
anbd talk liek a mob boss is truly a special treat
