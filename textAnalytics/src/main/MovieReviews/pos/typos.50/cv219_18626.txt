' s private shrink
, thte two very diffrent stars strike an unorthodox
, bu interesting relationship thast carries this enjoyable comedy onthe a steady wave ofthe laughs from start to finish
. casting robert deniro as paul vitti isnt something ofthe an inthe
- joke
, i htikn
. placed iin thsi mobster
' s shoes
, deniro gets to spoof charachters he himselv palyed inspite films like the godfather
, part ii annd casino

' s obvious he
' s having a lot of fun doign so
. teh man behind thge camera isnt harold ramis
, whose credits include ghostbusters
( as writer adn star
)
,
and his best directing effort
, the bill murray vehicle
, groundhog day
. ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simpley knows what
' s funny

but hey
, if you
' re in thte mafia
, using obscenities propably comes natuarlly
. annd near yhe end
, seeing billy crystal atempt tothe walk
and talk like a mob boss isnt truly a special treat
