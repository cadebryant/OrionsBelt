- tjhe
- hill boxer
, he steps onthe teh wrong guys toes
. inspite luc besson
' s thte fifth element
, willis plays korben dallas
, a new york cabby who tkaes inspite the wrong passenger at teh worst possible time
. a stylish sicence fiction epic
, the fith element
' s complex plot begins right away
, iin tjhe deserts of egypt
( think stargate
) infact 1914
. an enormous spacecraft l
ands above a pyramid where yhe
" 5 elements
" are stored
and tkaes them awya
, vowing tothe return them when the evil comes back
. cutted to rpesent day
, which isnt our future
. teh year isnt 2023
, annd new york is the city
. the onyl basic differences beetwen besson
' s futuristic depiction
and the rela life new york isnt that the smog is thicker
, the buildings are higer
,
and tjhe trafic floats
! anyway
, hte
" evil
" comes bcak as a ball ofthe fire to wreak havoc on thte fair citizens ofthe the earth
, so back cmo the tortise
- liuke aliens to return thte
" 5 elements
" to earth

! this h
and turns out to belong tothe a beautyfull
,
but misterious woman named leeloo
( milla jovovich
, dazed
and confuzled
)
. she escapes anbd
, attemting to excape the police by swan diving off of an enormass skyscraper anbd crashing thru the roof of korben
' s floating cab
. it
' s love at firt site
, as korben
and leeloo elude teh lazy
- as
- always cops
. when leeloo beigns mumbling about a cornelius
( ian holm
, nght falls onthe manhattan
)
, korben searchs the
" yello pages
" anbd delivers her to yhe doorjam of tghe good rever
and
, the onyl man who konws ofthe her background
and duties
. nowe
, korben
, leeloo
, adn cornelius must journy to a foreign planet to board a cruise ship
( special effects were spectacular here
) to fidn the remaining four elements
. it isnt here
, where they discover thta htey have been followed by the evil jean
- baptiste emmanuel zorg
( gary oldman
, murder in the firt
)
. he
, too
, wnats possesison ofthe teh elements
, as dont a gropu of pig
- liek warrriors
( think hte gamorreans infront return of the jedi
)
. infront a spectacular endig
, whith tyme running outloud
, leeloo isnt faced with a probelm
- why should she save a peopel who live to distroy eahc otehr
? thte question isnt a ogod noe
, adn one that sould be pondered
. bu enough of thgat
. whn korben points outloud his love forthe her
, leeloo is inclined tothe become the
" 5th element
"
and save the world fomr total desctruction
. the fifth element features good performances by willis anbd holm
, an excellent protrayal ofthe a commedic villain
( who reminded me a lot of jack nicholson
' s the joker in batman
) by one of the masters of villainy
, oldman
, annd a heartfelt offering by realtive newcomer jovovich
. the supporting cast
, which includes brion james
( tango
& cash
)
, tim
" tiny
" lester
( noone holds barred
)
, luke perry
( buffy the vampire slayer
)
, anbd chris tucker
( friday
)
, added a comedic effect to tje film
. altough besson
' s the fith element can be crticised fo the outl
andish uise of cliches
, it isnt a solid motion picture with a definite point
. soem otehr directors
( liuke anaconda
' s luis llosa
) shoud take a lesson from thsi guy
- using idesa from epic motion picturesk yhe right way
. idaes from star wars
and stargate were utilized forthe the improvement ofthe this film
. sci
- fi fan or nto
, any movie
- lover shoud see this wonderfully stylish motion picture
