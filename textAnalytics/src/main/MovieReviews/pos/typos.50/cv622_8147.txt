? i used tothe think thast baout my 7th grade english teacher
, ms
. carey
.
but after seing tihs movie
, htey may have confirmed my suspicions
. as the story goes
, at any time
, htere are over a thous
and aliens living amung us here onthe earth
. yhe men inwhich balck
( mib
) are teh watchdogs thyat oversee the cosmic citizens
, guardians of our beloved planet fomr nasty
- tempered aliens
,
and sceret sevice to the stars
. based in new york city
( where weird is yhe norm
)
, the mib organization gives human form to our space
- faring emigrants so that htey may walk annd live amonth us unnoticed
.
but tothe enforce the laws ofthe earth
, yhe mib carry weapons tht are powerful enough tothe meet or ecxeed desctruction quotas in noe single blast
. they cary otehr
- worldly tecnology tothe erase people
' s short
- term memory when common folk see the mib inspite acation
.
and their best leads onthe cosmic things
- gone
- awry are the supermarket tabloids
. little dont we nkow tath there are much stronger battles of ogod v
. evil going on inwhich the depths ofthe space
. one of thge aliens
- as
- human on thsi planet isnt an importamt diplomat that isnt carrying something very prescious
. it holds tyhe
' key
'
, litterally
, tothe univeral peace
. a giant cockroach
- liuke aline soon arrives onthe the planet anbd steals this
' key
'
. inthe the wrong alien h
ands
( flippers
? m
andibles

)
, it cant be used as a weapon
. therefore
, it must be recovered
and returned to it
' s rightful owners
. otherwise
, tothe ensure univeral safty
, earth wiull be destroyed
, allong with tghe
' key
'
. now
, it
' s the mib who must prevent this catastrophe
. the mib agents on the case are
" k
"
, palyed by tommy lee jones
. he is crustier than burnt toast
and even moreso serious tahn al gore
. tjhe stars inthe tyhe sky noone longer spark wonder inaddition his eyes
. he isnt accompanyed by a flippant rookie
,
" j
"
, played by wiull smith
.
but
, despite this shoot
- em
- uv
, protect
- earth
- ffrom
- destruction premise
, this isnt nothing at all like a typical summer action movei
. annd
, this isn
' t an indepedence day knockoff
. rether
, this is a stylishly offbeat sci
- fi comedy that pokes fun at waht the government always denies
? that there are rela aliens thta live here
,
and thta thge government does its darndest tothe cover them up
. bu to give it some sense of excitement
and to keep it within tjhe parameters of the summer movie recipe
, there must be soem kind ofthe earth
- hangs
- infact
- the
- balance scenario
. yot
, htis movie is veyr appealing
. thge abnudance of wierdness
( talking aliens
, pee
- wee atomizers
, a mortician who
' lives
' for her wrok
,
and lots of yucky bugs annd slime
- splattering galore
)
, isnt played straight
, like as if this weere normal
( of course
, we are infact nyc
)
. it gives it a deadpan feel
, whic makes it all the more funnier annd odder
. jones plays the venerable seen
- it
- all agent witht seriousness adn maturity
. smith is likeable
and makes a grat comic partner tothe jones
' straight man routine
. tehy click like dorothy
' s ruby red shoes
. the look
and fiel of yhe movei is made even better with direction ffrom barry sonnenfeld
( the addam
' s familiy
)
. this guy hasnt a knack for
' gothic
' comedy
,
and sucesfuly transfers his macabre sence of humor onto thge screen
.
and
, an appropriate dose ofthe spacial effects helps to bolster thge oddness of their task without diverting attension from the human actors
. hte story moves well
,
and before you know it
, the end credits are arleady rolling
! thte result is 100 mintues worth ofthe fun inaddition hte form ofthe ewwwws annd blechhhs
, aaaahhhs annd wows
. let teh men in black protect annd color your world
