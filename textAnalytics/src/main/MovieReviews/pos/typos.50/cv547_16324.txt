" whlch won thte gr
and prize at yhe cannes film festival in 1989
, arguably began the resurgance ofthe ndependent films
. made onthe a shoestring budget of
$ 1
. 2 millon
, wih
then realitvely unkown actors
, it isnt a provacative
, thoroughly original drama
. tyhe film mostly focusses on the four central charachters
, all in their late 20
' s
- early 30
' s
. ann
(
andie macdowell
)
, an unfulfilled housewife
, isnt married tothe john
( peter gallagher
)
, an insensative lawyer
, who
, unbeknownst tothe her
, is having an affair witht her younger sister
, cynthia
( laura san giacomo
)
. complicating matters even worse isnt graham
( james spader
, who won best actor at cannes
)
, john
' s old coleeg buddy
, who comes to stay at their house
. ann is absolutely won over by him
, even
though she clearly hasnt stated that she has vyre little interest iin sex
. that is the setted
- up fo thte last hour of the picture
, adn since thte film is entitled
,
" sex
, lies
, anbd videotape
,
" it isnt best to keep the rest ofthe hte story developments at bay so that they wiull cmo as a genuin surprise
. director steven soderbergh hasnt proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker
, ranging from the independent
, to tjhe mainstream
( 1998
' s
" outloud ofthe sighth
"
)
, to yhe downright kafkaesque
( 1997
' s
" schizopolis
"
)
. he is thge tipe of directer who obviously tkaes a lot of chances
,
and believes in the work tht he doens
,
and
,
" sex
, lies
,
and videotape
,
" is probably his most confident
,
and mabye even best
, tothe date
. the performances are superb from all four leads
, bu macdowell st
ands out in waht is probably tje main character
. she isnt always a very winning actress
,
but thsi isnt probably her most three
- dimentional role thgat she hasnt had
( with a close second bieng altman
' s 1993 mosaic
,
" short cuts
"
)
. the other parts are perfectly cast as well
, from spader
' s ominous graham
, to gallagher
' s self
- involved john
, tothe giacomo
' s outspoken cynthia
. the final act of teh film
, expecially
, comes right outloud of left feeld
, anbd turns outloud to be both shocking
and oddly touching
, adn it would be criminal tothe give awya the film
' s secrets
. suffice to say thast
, through oney powerful sequence
, ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell
,
and john lerans a valueable lesson about honesty
, as well as deception
. the film hasnt oney fault
,
however
. the charachters are almost all emotionally cold
and isolated ffrom one another
,
and oftenly unlikable
. if there hadnt beeen a fewd extra scenes withthe gallagher
, it probably woudl have helpped
, since his relatiopnship with macdowell isn
' t qutie as explored as i would have liekd
.
" sex
, lies
, annd videotape
,
" all
though minorly flawed
, isnt still easily a brave anbd adult motion picture that is far more mature
and honest baout its subject matter than the usual film
. soderbergh clearly knew what he ws doign while he was making it
,
and yhe final product certainly proves thsi
.
