: weaknesses lie infront the writing
and in thge performence
. at frist it seems liek tjhe film isnt tothe be an invasion story
,
but thne phantom takes an hour
- long detour tothe cover oney chariot race befor retruning to the invasion theme
. this dilutes tje central tsory

, as if tehy were added omre to fill us in on extraneous backround information for otehr movies rether tahn form an integral part of thge presen movei
. vetran actors liam neeson anbd ewan mcgregor noticably outperform the other acting leads

. we are binded to be completly inundated by star wars publicity
, music annd tye
