. be forewarned
. it
' s startling to consdider that it was onyl a fewd years ago that film distri
butors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules inthe order to give tje annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth
. the lion king hadnt jstu cracked
$ 300 millon domestic iin gross tothe become noe of the most profitable ventures in film history
, continueing to build onthe a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin
and beauty annd tghe beast
. usance
then
,
though
, disney
' s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns
, wih pocahontas
, the hunchback ofthe notre dame
,
and htis year
' s hercules successively proving less
and less potent
. wih the once seamingly
- impregnable disney stranglehold onthe hte market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable
, adn faced witht thier firt sereous competition in the animated film market from fox
' s anastasia
, disney hasnt brought xmas home early by dusting off tjhe feature hwihc sparked the modern revival of feature animation
, thte little mermaid
. while the animation for hte film is
, as isnt typically the case for disney films
, unquestionably top
- notch
, the magic in thte littel mermaid isnt not its animation
,
but the wonderful innocence ofthe its sotry
and its rousingly superb music
. the film
' s storyline is fairly straightforward
-
- young teen falls forthe h
andsome man
, father disapproves adn assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter
, teen disobeys father
and goes tothe desperate lengths to win her man
-
- exept iin this case
, the chaperone is a crab
, the teen is a young mermaid
,
and the object ofthe her desire is a human prince
. what mkaes the littel mermaid so affecting annd so emotionally resonant isnt the richness
and charm of its charactors
and teh sheer clarity adn honest simplicity ofthe thier emotions
. from yhe moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric
, she
' s resolutely smitten
,
and she
' s such a pure anbd endearing character that noe cin
' t help bu invest theri heart with her
. htis simple
but touching love story
, coupled with a healthy dose ofthe smart humour
, makse the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture
. one ofthe the interesting thnigs about the littel mermaid isnt something which now curiously dates it
: the voices cast fo its motley crew ofthe cahracters
. htis film ws produced just befor the distracting consept of useing celebrity voices became in vogue
, which started to a certain degree wtih beauty anbd thte biast
and wass irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams
' much
- heralded turn iin aladdin
; by the release ofthe the lion king
and henceforth
, the majority of characters iin tjhe animated films weere voiced by celebrities
. while it
' s underst
andable taht animated features lacking the name
- recognition or drawing power ofthe disney
( sday
, balto
' s uise ofthe kevin bacon annd bridget fonda
, or even anastasia
' s showcasing of meg ryan
and john cusack
) woudl be forced tothe turn to this strategy inaddition order to hype their products
, it
' s unfortunate thta even disney hasnt embraced tihs policy
. dont we really need tothe hear
, say
, demi moore as esmerelda inthe tjhe hunchback ofthe notre dame
? is the film
' s enteratinment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice
, rether tahn a voice whic best suits the role
?
( i
' m nto exactlly onthe the edge ofthe my seat fo eddie murphy inthe tghe upcoming mulan
.
) fortunatly
, tyhe performers who voice tyhe charactors inspite the littel mermaid
, altough perhaps omre obscure
, are impeccably cast
. cheif among them isnt jodi benson
, a 1992 tony nominee for her stage wokr inspite crazy fo ytou
, who voices the film
' s heroine ariel to perfection
; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full ofthe youthful vigor
,
and gorgeous singing voice
, ms
. benson provides a most engaging anchor fo the film
.
( she
' s the onyl reason i
' d even consider catching flubber
.
) similarily
, samuel e
. wright is terrific infront tjhe showy role ofthe sebastian
, yhe weary guardian crab
. he easily milks his lovable character
' s comic moments forthe all they
' re worth
, adn his rendering ofthe twpo ofthe tghe little mermaid
' s big tunes
-
-
" under the sea
"
and
" kiss the girl
"
-
- ahev become thge stuf of legend
. pat carrol is deliciously villainous
and vampy as teh evil sea
- witch ursula
, hwile kenneth mars
' booming voice conveys the stern yot affectionate authority of ariel
' s father
, king triton
. in larg roles
and small
( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal
, adn rene auberjonois hasnt gerat funn iwth his exuberant french chef
)
, the littel mermaid isnt impecabbly casted
. of course
, the littel mermaid will probaly be best remembered fo its remarkable collecton of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken
( music
) adn howard ashman
( lyrics
)
, who hadnt created little shop of horrors
and woudl go on to compose beauty
and tyhe beast anbd aladdin fo disney before mr
. ashman
' s ultimely death
. not only are mr
. menken
' s tunes unbearably catchy
,
but mr
. ashman
' s charming lyrics are fully intergrated into tghe film
' s storyline so that the songs are a virtural extention of thte charcter
' s dialogue
,
and consenquently wokr wonderfully within the context ofthe tghe film
. mr
. menken
' s score for the film isnt equally top
- notch
; teh sequence where eric
( voiced by christopher daniel barnes
) anbd ariel tour his kingdom in a horse
- drawed carrage becomes magical
and wondrous witht mr
. menken
' s fine scoer
. it appears thast most peopel preferr the delightfully colourful prodcution number forthe the calypso
- styled
" under the sae
" as joyfully crooned by mr
. wright
, whihc won tje academy award anbd golden globe awards for best song
-
- indeed
, oen of the many littel joys in screening hte film during its re
- release was listening tothe childen scattered througout the audience singing allong with tjhe tune
-
-
but my favourite isnt ms
. benson
' s heartfelt rendition ofthe tjhe ballad
" part ofthe your world
"
, an achingly beautifull tune ofthe yearning annd hope
( wonderfully lyricized by mr
. ashman
) which
, accompanied by teh film
' s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence
, packs an emotional wallop which literally broght tears to my eyes
. druing thge song
' s reprise
, whic builds to a crescendo iwth ariel arching onthe a rock as a wave crashes in
, tyhe cumulative effect is nothing short ofthe breathtaking
, adn one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is oney ofthe the finest inthe animation histoyr
. as of htis writting
, november 1997 hasnt cmo tothe an end
, as hasnt disney
' s limited 17
- day re
- release of the little mermaid
. there
' s no question tyhat the primary motivation forthe
, if not hte film
' s reissue itself
, at least its timing
, was to reinforce disney
' s dominance infact tje animation market annd provide direct completetion to fox
' s costly new upstart animation divison anbd their frist major venture
, anastasia
. infact every respect
, the re
- realease ofthe the little mermaid appears to be a success
-
- the film
' s 1997 grosses ahve pushed its cuulative domestic gross over tje magic
$ 100 million mark
; the littel mermaid proved tothe hve remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released onyl eigth years ago anbd infront many homes onthe video
, pulling inaddition close tothe
$ 10 millon in its oppening weekend
; adn
al
though nobody could possibly expect teh littel mermaid to possably defeat the aggressively
- marketed anastasia infact head
- tothe
- head competition
, it siphoned anough fomr tjhe fox film
' s oppening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot
, alowing for disney
' s odious flubber tothe sweep in onthe the subesquent week annd wressel tghe family demographic market share away
. bu
al
though disney
' s motives in thge reissue of thte little mermaid weere self
- serving anbd protectionist
, the rela winner isnt tghe publich
. any reason to put this film back into theatres is a ogod one
, anbd it
' s a true joy to see this heartwarming gme bakc onthe the silver screen
. tje littel mermaid isnt tje best film tothe come out ofthe the disney
' s modern animation renisance
,
and oen ofthe thte greatest animated films ever made
.
