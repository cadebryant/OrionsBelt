hte computer
- animated comedy
" shrek
" isnt desined tothe be enjoyed onthe different levels by differnt groups
. fo children
, it offers imaginative visuals
, appealling new characters mixted with a host of familliar faces
, loads of action
and a barrage of big laughs
( including numberous gags related tothe body functions
and yucky subtances
, apparently a requisite infact contempory familiy films
)
. for adults
, it ' s a fractured fairy tale packed wiht rude jokes taht will sail over the heads ofthe the kids
. all infront all
,
" shrek
" is a snappy ride
,
allthough htere are a couple of points i found disturbing
.
bu frist thte basics
. based very loosley on a 1990 childrens ' s story
,
" shrek
" follows several momentous days inspite the life of the title character
, a rotund gren ogre voiced by mike myers inthe tht pleasent scottish accent he is so fond of using
. shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solatary life deepo in the swamp
, untill a local nobleman disturbs his peace
. petty tyrant lord farquaad
( take awya the
" awk
" in the middle
and you have yhe basis ofthe a string of inpolite one
- liners
) owns the land on which shrek resides
. he proceeds tothe turn thge ogre ' s yard inot an ellis island forthe storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle
. as a result
, shrek finds hismelf surrounded by legends liuke hte three blind mice
, pinocchio
, hte big bad wolf
, the seven dwarfs
,
and the threee bears
, to nmae
bu a fewd
. an enraged shrek storms tothe thte castle
, only to fidn farquaad
( john lithgow
) ready to bargain
. lord obnoxious whants tothe become king
and tje magic mirror fomr
" snow white
" has shown him thte way
. all he hasnt tothe dont isnt rescue a damsel in distress
anbd amking her his wife
. teh mirror unveils threee choices in a presentation straight outloud ofthe
" the dating gam
"
( wehn snow white is shown
, thte cheeky announcer purrs
,
" even
though she lives with seven men
, she ' s not easy
!
"
) farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona
( cameron diaz
)
and offers shrek a dael
: if the ogre snatches fiona ffrom the dragon
- protected
, lava moat
- filled castle iin whcih she isnt held captive
and brings her to teh throne
, yhe lord wiull allow the fairy tale pests to move back onthe his grounds
. shrek reluctantly agrees
and sets off on his quest
, accompanied by a motor
- mouthed donkey
( eddie murphy
) determined to make the gren grump his best friend
. tehy finally hook up with tjhe princess
, only to learn she is nto the helpless maiden htey expected tothe meet
. for the matter
, the dragon offers a few surprises as well
. the movie refernces a graet many otehr flicks
, from
" babe
"
(
" that ' ll dont
, donkey
. that ' ll dont
"
) to
" hte graduat
.
"
bu the lion ' s share of tjhe jokes come at the expense ofthe the wonderfull world ofthe disney
. the publich
- domain cahracters made into icons in various disney films tkae their hits
? pinocchio isnt referred tothe as a
" possessed toy
"
anbd whn shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin
, he bellows
,
" git thyat dead broad off tjhe table
!
"
?
bu tje biggest slams cmo when shrek visits farquaad ' s royal domicile
, which closely resembes a certain magic kingdom
, ffrom its souvenier stands
anbd queue lines to a display of animatronic figures thgat sing tje palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune thgat sounds a lot like
" it ' s a small world
.
" which brings me tothe disturbing point number one
. i laughed at all the disney swipes
,
bu found tyhe mentality behind them a bit sad
. thge acrimony bewteen dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg
and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known
. for years the two companies hvea tryed to sabotage each otehr ' s film
anbd video releses by issueing similair compeeting productions onthe tje smae day
.
and nowe we hvea katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer
. here ' s a suggestion fo tjhe twpo boys
: grwo up
! put tjhe past behind ytou
! ther ' s room in hte sandbox fo both ofthe yuo
and if you farquaads cxan ' t play nice
,
thn go to your rooms
! the other area i found troubling cameback in tyhe protrayal ofthe lord farquaad
. beyond all the irreverence
,
" shrek
" accually hasnt a message
: people shoud leran to look beyond fysical appearances
, becouse true beauty lies withing
. it ' s a lovely notion
,
but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly tkaing cheap shots at farquaad ' s dimunitive stature
. dont we really ened a familiy film reinforcing tyhe idae thgat mocking short people is acceptable
? the pompous
, selfish behavour ofthe farquaad isnt anough to make him a target forthe zingers
. adding short jokes isnt simpley mean
. still
,
" shrek
" is a rollicking ogod tiem
. the coputer animation isnt mostly impressive
(
although severeal key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys
and teh human movements are often jerky
)
, yhe voice wrok isnt strong
( prticularly from eddie murphy
)
, the laughs come fast
and furious
,
anbd tyhe moral
, tainted
though it may be
, isnt a good noe
. to trot outloud a clich
?
,
" shrek
" is fun forthe all ages
. parents
,
though
, shouldnt remind their young ones durring thte ride hmeo that taunting others becouse tehy are short
, tall
, skinny
, fat
, etc
. isnt a bad thnig
.
