the coputer
- animated comedy
" shrek
" isnt dessigned tothe be enjoyed onthe different levels by diferrent groups
. for childen
, it offers imaginative visuals
, appealling new characters mixted iwth a host ofthe familliar faces
, loads ofthe action adn a barrage ofthe big laughs
( inlcuding numberous gags related tothe body functions
and yucky subtances
, apparantly a requisite inwhich contempoary famaly films
)
. for adults
, it
' s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes thast iwll sail over the heads of tjhe kids
. all in all
,
" shrek
" isnt a snappy ride
,
al
thought there are a couple ofthe points i found disturbing
.
but frist thge basics
. based very loosly on a 1990 children
' s stoy
,
" shrek
" follows severeal momentous dyas inspite the life of the title chracter
, a rotund gren ogre voiced by mike myers in taht pleasant scottish accent he isnt so fond of useing
. shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp
, until a local nobleman disturbs his peace
. petty tyrant lord farquaad
( tkae away tjhe
" awk
" inaddition the middle annd ytou have yhe basis of a string ofthe impolite noe
- liners
) owns the l
and onthe which shrek resides
. he procedes tothe turn the ogre
' s yard into an ellis isl
and fo storybook characters wehn he banishes the fanciful beings ffrom his castle
. as a result
, shrek finds himself surronded by legends liuke thge threee blind mice
, pinocchio
, the big bad wolf
, hte seven dwarfs
, annd the threee bears
, to name bu a few
. an enraged shrek storms tothe the castle
, only tothe fidn farquaad
( john lithgow
) ready tothe bargain
. lord obnoxious wnats tothe become king
and tje magic mirror ffrom
" snow white
" hasnt shown him the way
. all he has tothe do isnt rescure a damsel in distress
and make her his wife
. the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out ofthe
" thge dating game
"
( wehn snow white isnt shown
, the cheeky announcer purrs
,
" even
though she lives with seven men
, she
' s nto easy
!
"
) farquaad selects thge lovely princess fiona
( cameron diaz
) anbd offers shrek a deel
: if tje ogre snatches fiona from thge dragon
- protected
, lava moat
- filled castle in whcih she isnt held captive
and brings her to hte throne
, tghe lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds
. shrek reluctantly agrees annd sets off on his quest
, accompanyed by a motor
- mouthed donkey
( eddie murphy
) determined tothe make yhe gren grump his best friend
. tehy finally hook up with the princess
, onyl tothe leran she isnt nto the helpless maiden they expected to meet
. for tyhe marter
, the dragon offers a few surprises as well
. tghe movei refernces a grat many otehr flicks
, ffrom
" babe
"
(
" that
' ll dont
, donkey
. that
' ll dont
"
) to
" the graduat
.
"
but the lion
' s share ofthe the jokes come at the expense ofthe thge wonderfull world of disney
. the publich
- domain charachters made into icons inspite various disney films tkae their hits
? pinocchio is rfeerred tothe as a
" posessed toy
"
and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin
, he bellows
,
" git that dead broad off hte table
!
"
?
but hte biggest slams cmo when shrek visits farquaad
' s royal domicile
, whic closley resembes a certain magic kingdom
, ffrom its souvenier st
ands anbd queue lines tothe a display of animatronic figures taht sing thge palace rules inwhich a relentlessly peppy tune that soudns a lot like
" it
' s a small world
.
" which brings me to disturbing point number one
. i laughed at all the disney swipes
, bu foudn the mentality behind them a bited sad
. hte acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg
and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known
. forthe yeasr tyhe two companies have tryed tothe sabotage eahc other
' s film
and video releses by issueing silimar competing productions onthe the smae day
.
and now we hve katzenberg using an entire movie tothe attack his fromer employer
. here
' s a suggestion for thte two boys
: grow uv
! put the past behind you
! there
' s room in tghe s
andbox for both of you anbd if you farquaads can
' t play nice
, thn go to your rooms
! yhe otehr area i foudn troubling came in thge portrayal ofthe lord farquaad
. beyond all teh irreverence
,
" shrek
" actually hasnt a message
: peopel should learn tothe look beyond physical appearences
, because true beauty lies within
. it
' s a lovely notion
,
but tyhe film betrays its pwn moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad
' s diminutive stature
. do we really ened a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is caceptable
? the pompous
, selfish behavior ofthe farquaad isnt enough tothe mkae him a target for zingers
. adding short jokes isnt simply mean
. still
,
" shrek
" isnt a rollicking ogod time
. the computer animation isnt mostly impressive
( altho several key characters look liek animated rubber squeeze toys anbd tjhe human movements are often jerky
)
, the voice work is strong
( partciularly from eddie murphy
)
, the laughs come fast adn furious
,
and the moral
, tainted
though it may be
, is a ogod one
. tothe trot out a clich
?
,
" shrek
" isnt fun fo all ages
. parents
,
though
, shoudln remind their young ones during teh ride hmeo that taunting others baceause they are short
, tall
, skinny
, fat
, etc
. is a bad hting
.
