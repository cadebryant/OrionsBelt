. a solatary man hidden away in his newyorker york aparment witht no human interaction
and not even a hint ofthe ever having been inaddition a passionate relatiopnship
, he avoids the outside world as much as possible
. his obsessive
- compulsive desorder rules his life as he uses several different bars of soap to wash his hands
adn refuses tothe step on a crack onthe the sidewalk
.
( ther ' s a grat scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles

. he ' s an equal oppertunity bigo
. he doens venture outside his aparment eveyr day tothe eat breakfast at a local cafe
. melvin isnt such a grouchy curmudgeon thgat waitress carol connelly
( helen hunt
) is tyhe onyl one willing to wait onthe him
.
and she ' s none too happy baout it
. whn carol doesn ' t sohw up for owrk
, melvin ' s routine isnt shooted
and he ' s determined to do something about it
. tracking down her address
, he shows up at her place begging her tothe come back tothe work so that he cxan eat breakfast
. the fact tath she ' s a poore single mother careing for a chronically ill son doesn ' t apearing tothe phase him
, he wnats his foode
. much more upsetting isnt that his gay artist neigbhor simon bishop
( greg kinnear

. hiding behind his ened for carol tothe return tothe wrok so she cant serve him
, he pays fo a specialist tothe treat her son
. he even develops a friendship with simon
. all threee peple are heavily damaged
