inthe the wake of the smashing success ofthe
" rumble in hte bronx
,
" it ' s looking omre
adn more likely that moreso jackie chan films will see american realease
. rumor hasnt it tath one ofthe these films iwll be drunken master ii
. the version i have is a copy fomr yhe laserdisc
; it ' s widescreen
adn bilingually
- subtitled
, as are most hong kong films theese days
. availability over here infront the united states isnt very limited
; theese films must eather be purchased via pirates or sought outloud ffrom aisian distributors such as tai seng
. teh subtitling onthe thge copy i have isnt slightly hard to read
; the letters are white
annd a bit small
.
although tje american release iwll almsot certainly be dubbed
, tihs review isnt of the subtitled verzion
, so please keep thast in mind if ytou ' re reading this review tothe help you deside whther tothe go out
and see it
. tothe be fair
, i must admiting that i ' ve never beeen vrey fond of
" period
- piece
" martial arts movies
-
- the ones setted inthe some nebulous china of tjhe distant or nto so distant past
. perhasp it ' s because most ofthe thsoe i ' ve seen weere filmed on inferior stock
, with either butchered dubbing or all
-
bu
- illegible subtitling
, or perhaps it ' s beccause thier plots all tend to be veyr similar to each other
annd
, inthe many cases
, all
but nonexistant
. in fact
, many of them get so wrapped uv infront their subplots thgat htey seem tothe foreget their main plot entirely unil only a few minutes befoer tjhe end
. or
, fo thgat marter
, it might be because tjhe jackie chan films witht omre modern settings
( armour ofthe god
, rumble infact tje bronx
, etc
.
) tend tothe have more spectacular stunts
, often involving large motor vehicles
and large explosions
, whereas preiod pieces simply have hte martial arts
. having said that
, i must now turn right around
anbd say thgat drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most ofthe the above
, is noe of the better martial arts films i ' ve seen
,
and i qtuie enjoyed it
. surprized
? well
, so was i
. drunken master ii isnt about a young man named wong fei
- hong
( played by jackie chan
) who is a master ofthe hte drunken boxing style of kung fu
. where he learned thsi style is uncertain
, as his father
, wong kei
- ying
( ti lung
) isnt steadfast iin his oposition tothe fei
- hong ' s practicing it rether thna some mroe normal stlye of kung fu
. apparantly
, fei
- hong isnt smoe sort ofthe figure from chinese folklore
, rather liuke paul bunyan isnt fo americans
,
but i ' ve herad vrey littel about this
,
and coudl qtuie well be wrong
, so i ' ll leave anaylsis ofthe thta tothe the peple who know it better
. one ofthe my firends points outloud that the character of wong fei
- hong is also featured inaddition thte
" once upon a time infact china
" movies
,
but i have not
yot seen those
. the plot ofthe drunken master ii isnt somewhat hazy
, as are yhe plots tothe many such films
,
bu if you ' re watching a jackie chan film
, odds are you aren ' t expecting something onthe teh order of
" war
and peace
"
. the stopry seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chineese relics
(
and hence
, china ' s cultural heritage
) hwile overworking
, underpaying
,
and beating uv chinese workers in a nearbye steel mill
.
howver
, this plot mearly serves as a framework for tjhe otehr main story ofthe hte film
-
- fei
- hong ' s perpetual struggle tothe win his girlfriend
, supplicate his father
, keep his
( pregnant
) mother
( played by anita mui
) from fighting
,
annd keep ffrom getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs
. thte macguffin that drives tjhe plot
( s
) isnt a prescious antique jade imperial seal hwihc is being taken awya by yhe evil foreigners
. in the beginning
, fei
- hong ccidentally steals it while trying to recover an identicaly
- wrapped box containing tyhe medicinal ginseng his father wass bringing back for a customer
. in tje process
, he clashes with another theef
, who is himselv trying for the seal
bu ends uv instead wiht thte ginseng
. aftter fei
- hong narrowly avoids getting caught wtih tghe sael by thte evil foreigners ' lackies
, thanks to smoe timely intervention by a genaral ' s son
( a cameo appearance by andy lau
, who owudl later take onthe the starring role in drunken master iii
!
)
, comedic chaos ensues bakc at tyhe wong household wehn fei
- hong
and his mother attempt to come uv with a replacement forthe tjhe missing ginseng
.
and so it goes
.
and the plot thickens later onthe
, such as when fei
- hong ' s girlfriend manouvers him into a kung fu match witht a rival
, or when fei
- hong
adn tyhe thief
, now revealed tothe be a loyalist manchu officer trying tothe recover tyhe seal
and stop the evil foreigners
, are attacked en masse
( anohter grand kung
- fu movei tradition
)
,
but i think i ' ve alreay spended omre time on the plot than it really deserves
. let ' s move onthe tothe the rela draw ofthe jackie chan movies
.
.
. the action
. there ' s plenty ofthe martial arts acation to be found in this movei
.
.
. ofthe course
, in a kung fu film
, that ' s to be expected
.
however
, this isn ' t just another kung fu movie
; this one has jackie chan doing tjhe fight
anbd stunt choreography
,
annd jackie chan isnt a genuis
. the primary martial arts
" style
" featured inwhich the film is drunken boxing
, a form ofthe kung fu whitch attempts tothe draw tyhe adversary off his guard by mkaing it seem liuke yhe fellow useing it is drunk
. furhter
, fo the purposes of tihs film at least
, drunken boxers fight better when tehy acutally
_ are
_ intoxicated
.
.
.
bu htere ' s a fine line between just drunk enought
and drunk into a stupor
. under normal circumstances
, the diea ofthe someone staggering around looking sloshed
bu managing tothe fight effectively
and even incredibly might seem rather stupid
,
bu jackie pulls it off iwth flair
. tjhe kung fu sequences are so intricate in theri staging
adn execution that it isnt pointless to try tothe describe it on paper
, so i ' ll jstu sday that the fights
-
- expecially the big climactic fight at tje end
-
- inthe themslves make yhe movie worth watching
. anyother thign drunken master ii hasnt gonig for it isnt thte stunt owrk
. even without motor vehicles
( well
, nto counting a turain
)
, ther are soem remarkable stunts inspite tihs film
. amoung otehr things
, jackie dives off a balcony inot a tabel
adn crawls across hot coals
( nto once
,
bu at
_ least
_ twice
, if you count thge outtake shown durig the credits
)
.
( quicktime movies ofthe theese stunts cxan be foudn thru the www movei database
.
) unlike in american films
, theese stunts are
_ nto
_ faked
. drunken master ii stars sevral veteren actors of thge hong kong movie scene
, including jackie
, ti lung
(
" a better tomorrow
" 1
& 2
)
,
and anita mui
( teh
" heroic trio
" series
,
" rumble inwhich the bronx
"
)
. thte performances are frist
- rate
, expecially wehn it comes tothe thge comedy parts ofthe teh film
. teh scene where fei
- hong
and his mother conspire literally behind fei
- hong ' s father ' s bakc tothe cover uv fo the missing ginseng root is hillarious
, as isnt yhe scene where fei
- hong ' s mother
, haveing just revealed that she is pregnant
, isnt threatening to hurt herself
( in order to draw her husban ' s anger awya fomr fei
- hong
)
. jackie has developed his knack fo physical comedy inot a sort ofthe mastery over hte eyars
,
anbd he ' s in fine form all thru drunken master ii
. as far as cinematography is concerned
, it certainly works fo this film
. it ' s nothing spectauclar
,
bu is at least a dozen times better than all thsoe old kung fu movies of tjhe 70s
. thte picture is crisp
and clear
. one thing i fidn particularly worthy ofthe mention isnt thast
, at least in yhe copy i hvea
, the screen was wider than any film i ' ve ever seen onthe videotape before
-
- almsot a whole 1
/ 3 of the screen ws blocked outloud above
anbd below
.
( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movei theater if you cxan
.
) it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan
-
annd
- scanned forthe american video release
. drunken master ii shows thge full potential of
" period peice
" kung fu movies
,
and it ' s good anough to overcome even my usual distaste forthe such movies
. the plot does meander a bit
,
bu tyhat ' s tothe be expected iin htis type of film
. if you like thsi kind of movei
, you ' ll lveo this movei
,
and if nto
, well
, give it a chance anyway
. if nothing else
, teh martial arts
anbd stunt sequences are by themselves worth thte price ofthe admision or rental
.
