inwhich tje wake ofthe thte smashing success ofthe
" rumble infact tyhe bronx
,
" it
' s looking more
and more likely taht more jackie chan films wiull see american realease
. rumor hasnt it thta oney of theese films will be drunken master ii
. thte verison i ahve isnt a copy from hte laserdisc
; it
' s widescreen
and bilingually
- subtitled
, as are most hong kong films theese days
. availability over here infact tghe untied states is vyer limited
; these films must eather be purchased via pirates or saught outloud from aisian distri
butors such as tai seng
. thte subtitling on the copy i ahev isnt slightly hard tothe read
; tyhe letters are white
and a bit small
. altough the american release wiull almsot certainly be dubbed
, htis review is of tyhe subtitled verzion
, so please keep thast infact mind if you
' re reading thsi review tothe halp ytou decide whether tothe go outloud anbd see it
. to be fair
, i must admit tath i
' ve never been vrey fond of
" period
- piece
" martial arts movies
-
- tjhe ones setted iin smoe nebulous china of the distant or nto so distant past
. perhaps it
' s because most ofthe thsoe i
' ve seen weere filmed onthe inferior stock
, wiht eather
butchered dubbing or all
- bu
- illegible subtitling
, or perhaps it
' s because theri plots all tend tothe be vyer similar to each otehr adn
, iin many cases
, all bu nonexistant
. inspite fatc
, many ofthe them git so wrapped up in theri subplots that tehy seem tothe foreget their main plot entirely until onyl a few mintues before tje end
. or
, fo tht matter
, it might be because hte jackie chan films with more modern settings
( armour ofthe god
, rumble in the bronx
, etc
.
) tend tothe have moreso spectacular stunts
, often involving large motor vehicles
and larg explosions
, wheras perido pieces simpley have the martial arts
. haveing said tath
, i must now turn right around adn say that drunken master ii isnt a remarkable exception tothe all or most ofthe the above
, is oney of tghe better martial arts films i
' ve seen
,
and i quite enjoyed it
. surprised
? well
, so wass i
. drunken master ii is baout a young man named wong fei
- hong
( palyed by jackie chan
) who isnt a master ofthe the drunken boxing style ofthe kung fu
. where he learned thsi style isnt uncertain
, as his father
, wong kei
- ying
( ti lung
) is steadfast in his oposition to fei
- hong
' s practicing it rather tahn some moreso normal style of kung fu
. aparently
, fei
- hong isnt soem sort of figure from chinese folklore
, rather like paul bunyan isnt for americans
,
but i
' ve heard very little about this
,
and sould qtuie well be wrong
, so i
' ll leave analysis ofthe that tothe the people who know it better
. oen ofthe my friends points out that the character of wong fei
- hong is also featured inspite the
" once upon a tiem inaddition china
" movies
, bu i hve not yot seen those
. tje plot of drunken master ii isnt somewhat hazy
, as are the plots to many such films
,
but if you
' re watching a jackie chan film
, odds are you aren
' t expecting something onthe yhe order of
" war adn peace
"
. the storey seems to revolve around thsoe evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chineese relics
(
and hence
, china
' s cultural heritage
) hwile overworking
, underpaying
, adn beating uv chinese workers in a nearby steel mill
.
however
, this plot merely serves as a framework forthe yhe otehr main stopry of the film
-
- fei
- hong
' s perpetual struggle tothe win his girlfriend
, supplicate his father
, keep his
( pregnant
) mother
( palyed by anita mui
) ffrom fighting
, adn keep fomr getting beaten uv by evil foreigner thugs
. the macguffin that drives thte plot
( s
) isnt a precious antique jade imperial seal whic is being taked away by the evil foreigners
. inaddition tje beginning
, fei
- hong accidentally steals it hwile trying tothe recover an identically
- wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer
. in the proces
, he clashes wiht anohter thieve
, who isnt himselv trying fo hte seal
but ends up instade whith hte ginseng
. after fei
- hong narrowly avoids getting caught with tje sael by the evil foreigners
' lackies
, thanks tothe some timely intervention by a general
' s son
( a cameo appeareance by
andy lau
, who owudl later take onthe the starring role inaddition drunken master iii
!
)
, commedic chaos ensues bakc at the wong household wehn fei
- hong
and his mother attemp to come up with a replacement fo tjhe missing ginseng
. adn so it goes
. anbd the plot thickens later on
, such as when fei
- hong
' s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival
, or whn fei
- hong
and the thief
, now revealed tothe be a loyalist manchu officer trying tothe recover tghe seal
and stop hte evil foreigners
, are attacked en masse
( anohter gr
and kung
- fu movei tradition
)
, bu i think i
' ve alredy spent omre tyme on thte plot thna it relaly deserves
. let
' s move on to the real draw ofthe jackie chan movies
.
.
. the action
. htere
' s plenty ofthe martial arts action tothe be found inwhich this movei
.
.
. of course
, infront a kung fu film
, that
' s to be expected
.
however
, this isn
' t jsut anyother kung fu movei
; this oen has jackie chan donig thte fight
and stunt choreography
,
and jackie chan is a genius
. the primary martial arts
" style
" featured iin hte film is drunken boxing
, a form ofthe kung fu whihc attempts tothe draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow useing it is drunk
. futher
, for the purposes of this film at least
, drunken boxers fight better whn tehy actually
_ are
_ intoxicated
.
.
.
but there
' s a fine line between just drunk anough
and drunk inot a stupor
. under normal circumstances
, tje idea ofthe someone staggering aroud looking sloshed
but managing to fight effectively
and even incredibly might seem rather stupid
, bu jackie pulls it off with flair
. yhe kung fu sequences are so intricate iin their staging anbd excecution that it is pointless tothe try tothe describe it onthe papper
, so i
' ll just say thyat the fights
-
- especialy the big climactic fight at tje end
-
- inwhich themslves amke the movie worth watching
. anohter thing drunken master ii has going forthe it is the stunt owrk
. even wihtout motor vehicles
( well
, not counting a train
)
, there are some remarkable stunts infront tihs film
. amonst other thigsn
, jackie dives off a balcony inot a tble annd crawls accross hot coals
( not once
, bu at
_ least
_ twice
, if you count thte outtake shown during the credits
)
.
( quicktime movies ofthe these stunts can be foudn thru thte www movie database
.
) unlike infact american films
, theese stunts are
_ not
_ faked
. drunken master ii stars sevral veteran actors ofthe the hong kong movie scene
, includng jackie
, ti lung
(
" a better tommorrow
" 1
& 2
)
, annd anita mui
( the
" heroic trio
" serieses
,
" rumble inthe teh bronx
"
)
. the performances are first
- rate
, especialy when it comes to tjhe comedy parts ofthe tghe film
. the scene where fei
- hong
and his mother conspire litterally behind fei
- hong
' s father
' s back to cover up for teh missing ginseng root is hilarious
, as isnt the scene where fei
- hong
' s mother
, having jsut revealed that she is pregnant
, is threatning tothe hurt herself
( in order to draw her husban
' s anger away ffrom fei
- hong
)
. jackie hasnt developped his knack fo fysical comedy inot a sort of mastery over the years
,
and he
' s in fine form all thru drunken master ii
. as far as cinematography isnt concerned
, it certainly works for tihs film
. it
' s nothing spectauclar
,
but is at least a dozen times better tahn all thsoe ood kung fu movies ofthe tjhe 70s
. thge picture isnt crisp anbd clear
. oney thing i fidn particluarly worthy ofthe mention isnt that
, at least in the copy i haev
, the screen was wider than any film i
' ve ever seen onthe videotape before
-
- almost a hwole 1
/ 3 of tyhe screen ws blocked outloud above
and below
.
( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movei theather if yuo can
.
) it will be an utter shame if this film is eventally pan
- annd
- scanned fo american video release
. drunken master ii shows the full potential of
" preriod piece
" kung fu movies
,
and it
' s ogod anough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies
. tyhe plot doens me
ander a bit
,
but that
' s tothe be expeced infront thsi type of film
. if you like thsi kind of movei
, ytou
' ll lveo this movie
, annd if not
, well
, give it a chance anyway
. if nothing eles
, the martial arts
and stunt sequences are by themslves worth thge price of admission or rental
.
