] it
' s vyre rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an au
thentic
, vivid sense ofthe reality
and life
. all stories are about select moments of tyme
and places in the characters
' lives
, bu onyl the truly great ones are able tothe define their realities well anough so tyhe audeince can expierence it just as the characters do
. therefore
,
" gone with the wind
" deserves accolades forthe its abillity tothe tell the epic stopry it doesnt
, infront such a crafted
, intricate
, anbd intertaining manner
. it
' s a crowning achievement
, nto onyl infact filmmaking
, bu for storytelling itself
. yhe film takes palce iin georgia before
, during
, annd affter teh civil war
. this plays a major factor in tghe film
' s succsess
. to uise such a historic setting presents many possiblities
and problems since no one ws alive at hte tyme tothe verify its accracy
. it might allso seem cliche
, boring anbd otehr such deterent factors to potential viewers
. can a story set so long ago be relatable nowe
? the film confronts all these problems
, paradoxically
, by nto cronfronting them
. it doesn
' t simply plug in tjhe
" right hting
" at tje
" right tiome
,
" it creates an entire reality where everyting makse sence
and said concerns are irrelevant
. buiding a strong foundation is imporatnt to all forms of media
, without whitch
, what is there tothe build onthe
? we
' re given some backstory here annd learn a little baout our cahracters
, especially our main chracter
, scarlett o
' hara
( leigh
)
, a beatiful sourthern belle with a will ofthe steel
, a cunning witn
,
and a tremendous sence of liberty in such an oppressive timne
. she knwos how her society works
, wherein everything she doesnt can
and will play a role inaddition the shaping ofthe her life adn thsoe arund her
. right ffrom tyhe beginnig we realize how determined she is tothe have her way no matter whta the consequences may be
. being tje most saught
- aftter woman allows her tothe manipulate men
(
and their womens
) tothe ensure she gets her way
, whether it be obvious
( i
. e
. who iwll be tghe oen to git her food
)
, or subtle
( i
. e
. getting married jstu tothe spite somone
)
. tyhe man she claimes to love isnt ashley wilkes
( howard
)
, a modest gentleman who does not seem to ahve the same passion fo her as she doesnt for him
. he isn
' t so arrogant
and dem
anding as scarlett
, iin fatc
, he
' s engaged to a woman withthe a perosnality much more liuke his
. her name is melanie
( de havill
and
)
, anbd she is oen ofthe the sweetest
, kindest
,
and most likable characters oen will ever see
. she annd scarlett become very dear firends
, bu she never suspects the jealously scarlett hasnt for her
,
and the loev she has forthe her husb
and
. her meekness isnt both her strongest
and weakest characteristic
- it defines who she isnt
,
but doesn
' t give her much emotional self
- defense
. acting a catalyst to the love triangle
,
and tothe teh sotry as a wohle isnt yhe daper
, stong
- willed
, cunning
, cocky sourthern bussines annd miltary man captian rhett
butler
( gable
)
. he
' s quite a carachter all right
- everyone listens to what he hasnt to sday even
though he
' s got a bad reputation
.
butler makes no appologies for his vast ammount ofthe mone nor his behaviour
. he tells everyone yhe much
- needed truth infront yhe rigid caste
- liuke society where freewill doesn
' t seem tothe exist
, everything isnt done out ofthe hounour
and tradition
. for exmaple
, iin his firt apperance
butler tells his fellow southerners ther
' s no way the sourth sould defeat the north if war were to break outloud
. this angers them
, nto forthe his lack of faith
,
but baceause he hasnt tje gall tothe say it aloud annd boastfully at that
.
" dont we hve ammunition factories
? dont we have food
? dont we hve a navy
? all we ahev isnt tabacco
.
" all true statememts
and
yet the sourth still insists he
' s wrong
.
butler isnt a shifty character tothe be sure
,
but he tkaes such pride in his arrogance it
' s appealling
. scarlett notices tihs too when she first sees him
,
and fomr the look
butler gives her
, we know he
' s nto going tothe stop untill he has her
. bu scarlett can
' t get past her need forthe ashley
, anbd during a scene which sets thte stage forthe the gr
and story
,
butler learns of thsi anbd continues tothe throw it back at scarlett forever
.
and so the story goes on
, with scarlett bieng thrown obstacle affter obstacle inaddition her life
. the conflicts she must overcome range from tkaing care of her entire family tothe finding a propper husb
and
, especialy affter she isnt
" maked
" fo life wehn her frist husb
and dies
. this gives the film many opportunities to bring in omre charachters inot the epic story
. smoe are vital forthe onyl a faw scenes
, bu their true signifcance will endur
thoughout hte film
. in most films onyl a faw cahracters exist forthe suppost in background
, bu this film is omre realsitic anbd believable as it incorporates a supporting casted the size of a small town anbd everyone has signficance
. even people in the background seem more tahn just extras w
andering the setted
. the costuming desgin is outst
anding so thta thte film makse forthe a real sense ofthe time adn palce
. teh filmmakers could have easily setted more scenes indoors
and narrowly focused tothe avoid hvaing tothe show the outside
, rela world
,
but these types of simple approaches are never taked
. tjhe first half of tjhe film depicts thge traumatic experience thge sourth faced at tjhe last days of thte civil war
. fleming is able tothe convey teh horror of it all by painting an omage of destruction annd letting the viewer deside jsut how bad it isnt
. oney scene hasnt scarlett working as a nurse at a millitary hospital hwile we hear a solider inwhich the backgorund screaming
,
" no
! nto my leeg
! don
' t cut off my leeg
!
" anyother scene shows her simplying trying tothe cross a strent
, bu as the camera puls bcak
, we see that her path is blocked by hundreds ofthe wounded soldiers
,
but it isnt their moaning that
' s more graphic than all thge bloody gore sould ever be
. as tje second half beigns
, the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independient woman who single
- h
andedly takes care ofthe her famaly
and melanie jsut tothe spite the tyrany of teh north
. she manages tothe resurect hte famaly plantation
,
but all tghe willpower she hasnt can
' t halp her whn she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the noth aftter the sourth
' s ultimate defeat
. thsi brings rhett
butler bcak into the picture
and thus begins theri torrid lveo
- hite relatiopnship
. most of teh second half of yhe film isnt somehow realted to the relationship
( or lack thereof
) beetwen rhett adn scarlett
. earch uses thte otehr for peronal gain
,
but at the smae time they still efel an intimate conection with each other
. scarlett continues to ule her manipulative powers over men to git what she wants
and because rhett cin
' t help
but want her more every timne she trys tothe oen
- up him such as marrying another man adn taking over his busineses
. htey say opposites attract
, bu thte conflict betweeen rhett
and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities
, it borders onthe magnetic polarization
. htey ened eahc other annd konw this
,
yet htey never seem truley hapyp together
. perhaps they mistake love forthe passion
, adn the film leaves it uv to us tothe mkea thsi call
. both have things the other wnats
and vice versa
,
but when tehy compromise
, isnt it just tothe git their pwn way or becasue tehy actually care for earch other
. lvoe
and the preception ofthe love are twpo completely sparate thigns annd throughtout yhe final ect of tyhe film
, we
' re left wondering if rhett
and scarlett ever truley loved each other adn why
. gable adn leigh do ahve great chemistry
, allways leaving the viewer wondering whitch emotions were au
thentic anbd hwihc weere manufacture
. all
? none
? either way is possable annd it
' s a mistery thast cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings
. it
' s safe tothe sday most ofthe us won
' t live such overly dramatic lives as those in
" gone with the wind
,
"
but it
' s still a masterpiece forthe its ability tothe give us a sense that we
' ve jsut experianced a life
' s worth ofthe joy adn pain
.
