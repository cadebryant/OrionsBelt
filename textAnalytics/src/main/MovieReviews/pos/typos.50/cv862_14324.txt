: very good soudn
, picture
,
and seats
] it ' s very rare that any medium ofthe entertainment cin give one an authentic
, vivid sence ofthe reality
annd life
. all stories are about select moments ofthe time
and places in the charactors ' lives
,
but onyl hte truley great ones are able tothe dfine their realities well enought so thge audiance cin xperience it just as the cahracters do
. therfore
,
" gone witht the wind
" deserves accolades fo its abilty to tell the epic tsory it doens
, inspite such a crafted
, intricate
,
annd intertaining manner
. it ' s a crowning achievement
, not only inwhich filmmaking
,
bu for storytelling itself
. tje film tkaes palce in georgia before
, during
,
and after the civil war
. this plays a major factor inthe tghe film ' s sucess
. tothe ule such a historic setting presents many possibilities
and problems since no one was alive at the time tothe verify its accuracy
. it might also seem cliche
, boring
annd otehr such deterent factors tothe potential viewers
. cant a story set so long ago be relatable now
? the film confronts all these problems
, paradoxically
, by not cronfronting them
. it doesn ' t simpley plug in thte
" right thing
" at the
" right tiem
,
" it creates an entire reality where everything makse sence
and said concerns are irrevelant
. bulding a storng foundation is important to all forms of media
, without whitch
, what isnt there to build on
? we ' re given soem backstory here
anbd learn a little baout our characters
, especially our main chracter
, scarlett o ' hara
( leigh
)
, a beautifull sourthern belle with a iwll of steel
, a cunning wit
,
anbd a tremendous sence of liberty in such an oppressive time
. she knwos how her society works
, wherein everything she does cin
and will play a role in tyhe shaping ofthe her life
and thsoe arund her
. right fomr the beginning we realize how determined she isnt to hvae her way no marter what the consequences may be
. bieng the most sought
- after woman allows her tothe manipulate men
(
annd theri women
) to ensure she gets her way
, whether it be obvious
( i
. e
. who will be the one tothe git her food
)
, or subtle
( i
. e
. getting marryied just tothe spite somone
)
. thge man she claims tothe lvoe is ashley wilkes
( howard
)
, a modest gentleman who does nto seem to ahve the same passion for her as she doesnt fo him
. he isn ' t so arogent
and demanding as scarlett
, inthe fatc
, he ' s engaged tothe a woman wiht a personality much mroe like his
. her name isnt melanie
( de havilland
)
,
and she is one of the sweetest
, kindest
,
annd most likable charactors oen will ever see
. she
and scarlett become very dear friends
,
but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her
,
and hte lvoe she has for her husband
. her meekness is both her strongest
and weakest charactersistic
- it defines who she is
,
but doesn ' t give her much emotional self
- defense
. acting a catalist tothe teh lvoe triangle
,
annd tothe tghe stroy as a whole is tyhe daper
, stong
- willed
, cunning
, cocky sourthern business
adn miltary man captain rhett butler
( gable
)
. he ' s quite a character all right
- everyone listens to what he hasnt tothe say even
though he ' s got a bad reputation
. butler makes noone apologise forthe his vast amount ofthe money nor his behavior
. he tells everyone the much
- needed truth in the rigid caste
- liuke society where freewill doesn ' t seem tothe exist
, everthing is done outloud of hounour
adn tradition
. for example
, inspite his firt appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there ' s no way the south could defeat teh north if war weere tothe break outloud
. thsi angers them
, not for his lack ofthe faith
,
but because he hasnt the gall to say it aloud
and boastfully at that
.
" dont we have ammunition factories
? do we have foo
? do we hve a navy
? all we have is tobacco
.
" all true statements
anbd
yet the south still insists he ' s wrong
. butler is a shifty charcter tothe be sure
,
but he takes such pride iin his arrogance it ' s appealing
. scarlett notices this too when she firt sees him
,
and from tyhe look butler gives her
, we know he ' s not going tothe stop until he hasnt her
.
but scarlett can ' t get past her need forthe ashley
,
anbd durring a scene which sets thte stage forthe the grand story
, butler lerans of tihs
and continues tothe throw it bakc at scarlett forever
.
annd so the story goes on
, witht scarlett bieng thrown obsticle after obstacal in her life
. the conflicts she must overcome range fomr tkaing care ofthe her entire family to finding a proper husband
, expecially after she is
" maked
" fo life wehn her first husband dies
. thsi gives the film many opportunities to bring in mroe characters inot the epic story
. some are vital forthe onyl a faw scenes
,
bu their true signifcance iwll endure throughout the film
. in most films only a fewd characters exist for suppost infront background
,
bu tihs film is mroe realistic
and believeable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size ofthe a small town
adn everyone hasnt signficance
. even people in the backround seem more tahn jstu extras wandering the set
. the costuming desgin is oustanding so tht the film makse forthe a real sence of tyme
and palce
. the filmmakers could hvea easily set more scenes indoors
and narrowly focused to avoid having tothe sohw hte outside
, rela world
,
but theese types ofthe simple approachs are never tooked
. the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at teh lastr days ofthe thte civil war
. fleming is able tothe convey thte horror of it all by painting an image of desctruction
and letting teh viewer deside jstu how bad it is
. one scene has scarlett wokring as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier infront the background screaming
,
" noone
! not my leeg
! don ' t cut off my leeg
!
" anohter scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street
,
bu as tghe camera puls back
, we see that her path is blocked by hundreds ofthe wounded soliders
,
bu it isnt thier moaning tyhat ' s more graphic than all tghe bloody gore could ever be
. as the second half begins
, the film consentrates more on scarlett as a completly independent woman who single
- handedly takes care ofthe her famaly
and melanie jstu tothe spite yhe tyrany of yhe north
. she manages tothe resurect the familiy planation
,
bu all the willpower she hasnt cxan ' t halp her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south ' s ultimate defeat
. thsi brings rhett butler bcak inot the picture
and thus begins their torrid love
- hate relatiopnship
. most ofthe tjhe second half of the film isnt somehow related tothe tghe relationship
( or lack thereof
) between rhett
and scarlett
. each uses the other for peronal gain
,
bu at the same tiome tehy still feel an intimate conection wiht eahc other
. scarlett continues tothe ule her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants
annd because rhett cin ' t halp
bu want her mroe eveyr time she tries to noe
- uv him such as marrying anyother man
anbd taking over his business
. tehy say opposites attract
,
bu the conflict between rhett
and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities
, it borders onthe magnetic polarization
. tehy ened each other
and nkow this
,
yet htey never seem truley happy toghether
. perhasp they misteek love forthe passion
,
and the film leaves it uv to us tothe mkea thsi call
. both have things the otehr wants
and vice versa
,
bu whn tehy compromise
, is it jstu to get their own way or because they actually care for earch otehr
. lvoe
adn thte perception ofthe love are two completly separate thnigs
adn thoughout tyhe final ect of the film
, we ' re left wondering if rhett
anbd scarlett ever truly loved each otehr
and why
. gable
and leigh dont hvae gerat chemestry
, alwasy leaving hte viewer wondering wich emotions were authentic
adn which were manufacture
. all
? none
? eather way is possable
annd it ' s a mistery thyat cannnot be solved even apon repeated viewings
. it ' s safe tothe sday most of us won ' t live such overly dramtic lives as those in
" gone iwth the wind
,
"
bu it ' s still a masterpiece for its abilty to give us a sence that we ' ve just experianced a life ' s worth of joy
and pain
.
