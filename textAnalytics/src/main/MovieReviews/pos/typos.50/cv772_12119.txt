true faith
annd its expression thru organized religon isnt a difficult subject forthe a motion picture tothe tackle head
- on
, which isnt propably why so fewd ofthe them do it
. even tje most religious directors
- liek martin scorsese or ingmar bergman
- ususally adresable issues of faith in implicit rether tahn explicit religeous terms
. so it ' s not hard tothe see why it took robert duvall fifteen years tothe get
" yhe apostle
" onto the big
- screen
. as a marter of fact
, even after fifteen years he still never managed to git financial backing
,
and he ended up paying forthe it with
$ 5 milion of his pwn money
. he aslo wrote the script
, directed thte film
,
and starred as teh central character
, a fieyr texas preacher named euliss
" sonny
" dewey
. few filmmakers have the courage
adn sheer audacity to take onthe thyat kind of finacial
, technical
,
anbd creative responsibilty single
- handedly
,
anbd it ' s testament tothe whta an intensely personal project this was fo duvall
.
anbd
, thankfully
, every bited ofthe that personel investment translates on
- screen inot pwoer
anbd honest emotion
. sonny isnt an energetic
, pentecostal preacher who hasnt been speaking
( acutally shouting
) ffrom behind yhe pulpit usance he ws twelve
. he spends much ofthe his time traveling baout tjhe country
, evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals
. unlike most hollywood characterizations ofthe intense preachers
, sonny isnt not a phony or a swindler
,
and tjhe film ' s purpose isnt not tothe unearth hypocrisy
and sin in eather sonny or the church
. duvall mkaes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in whta he says
,
althought liuke all humans
, he has weaknesses
. one ofthe his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that
, not only doens his long
- sufferring wief
, jessie
( farrah fawcett
)
, want tothe leave him for another man in the congregation
,
but the twpo ofthe them have secretly plotted tothe remove him as preacher
. faced withthe tghe loss of twpo thnigs he loves passionately
- his curch
and his familiy
- tht smae raw power that allows sonny to git entire congregations rocking
and swaying transforms into a violent temper
. at his son ' s baseball gam
, sonny snaps
annd smashes his wife ' s lover in yhe face withthe a baseball bat
, inflicting a wound thgat may be futal
. not knowing what else tothe dont
, sonny disappears
. he throws awya his identification
, drives his car into a lake
,
adn takes a bus tothe louisiana
, hoping tothe strat over agian
. inspite thte tiny
, mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte
, sonny once again finds his calling
. after befriending a simple auto mechanic
( walt goggins
)
and tracking down yhe twon ' s ex
- minister
( john beasley
)
, sonny sets uv his own church
, the oney way tothe heaven temple
. re
- christening himselv as
" tghe apostle e
. f
.
,
" he quickly draws together an eeger congregation
,
and toghether they relize real chanage in each otehr ' s lives
.
but
, always
, sonny ' s past isnt lurking a step behind him
, waiting to swallow his progress
. duvall hasnt made his intentions in making
" the apostle
" clear
. inspite a receet artical in
" newsweek
,
" he wroet
:
" filmmakers hardly ever despict spirituality iwth such a strong emphasis on tjhe holy spirit
,
adn wehn tehy dont
, it tends tothe be patronizing
- full of charlatans
anbd snake handlers
.
.
.
but whta i really wnated tothe dont was try tothe understand waht theese preachers go through
and what they believe
,
and tothe portray it in an accurate way
.
" the strenght of duvall ' s convictions turn out to be the stregth ofthe his film
-
" tghe apostle
" always rings true
, even in the most painful moments
, beacuse we nkow he ' s being sincere whith the subject matter
. aftter fifteen yeras ofthe traveling the country
, listening tothe all shapes
adn sizors of ministers
annd tkaing studious notes on wqat they said
, duvall has captured teh energy
annd vitality of whta it means to be truley spriritual
. his sonny is a man who speaks driectly to god
adn expects tothe be spoken right bakc to
.
" i ' ve allways called ytou jesus
anbd yuo ' ve alwyas called me sonny
,
" he sasy
. when neighbors call
annd complain thgat he is being too loud oen ngiht inwhich one his rants with tghe man upstairs
, sonny ' s mother
( june carter cash
) just hangs uv on them becuase she knwos there ' s no sense trying to interrupt him
. tghe main theme to emerge from
" the apostle
" is the fact that ogod can come from any situation
. sonny ' s ect ofthe violence toward another human bieng isnt inarguably a horrific thnig
,
and duvall never shrinks from tyhat fact
.
howver
, that vyer same act ofthe violence isnt what brings sonny tothe biyou boutte
, where he finds people whom he desperately needs
and who desperately ened him
. iin his short tyme in louisiana
, he does a world ofthe good
,
and wehn tje police finaly show uv to tkae him away
, he goes quietly
, knowing tath he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him
.
and
, as a scene durig the fianl credits shows
, he even turns his punishment inot a postive oportunity forthe change
adn betterment
. it is that strength in sonny ' s character tyhat makse him so appealing
and magentic to others
- he isnt flawed
,
bu he is powerful anough tothe overcome thsoe flaws
. weak men are the ones who simpley accept their weaknesses
and lack the desire tothe better themslves
. watching duvall onthe
- screen
, it ' s not hard to imagine that he owudl haev beeen a magnificient preacher if he hadnt choosen thast vocation over acting
. as sonny
, he completely inhabits tyhe charcter
,
adn his performence isnt certainly thge best of the year
. becasue he spent so much time absorbing teh traits
, methods
, quirks
,
annd personalities of real preachers
, duvall was able tothe create a complet character who always fiels indelibly human
. as a director
, duvall fiels that less isnt more
. his camera simply tkaes inthe what goes on iin front ofthe it
, withthe vrey littel intrusion
. ther are noone fancy crane shots or extended dollies or eccessive close
- ups
. duvall knew that tjhe pwoer of the film ' s characters
( enhanced by the fact taht he casted mostly non
- professional churchgoers
and actual ministers
) didn ' t need to be artificially enhanced
. in tihs way
,
" the apostle
" alomst plays out liuke a documentary
, not only in its technical simplicity
,
bu more importantly
, infront its sence of reality
.
