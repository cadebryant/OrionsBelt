true faith anbd its expression through organized religon isnt a difficult subject forthe a motion picture to tackle head
- onthe
, whihc is probablly why so few ofthe them do it
. even the most religious directors
- like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman
- usually addres issues of faith inaddition implicit rether than explicit religious terms
. so it
' s not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen yeasr to get
" teh apostle
" onto tjhe big
- screen
. as a marter of fact
, even affter fifteen yeras he still never managed tothe get finacial backing
, annd he ended uv paying fo it with
$ 5 milion of his own money
. he aslo wroet the scirpt
, directed yhe film
, annd starred as thte central character
, a fiery texas preacher named euliss
" sonny
" dewey
. few filmmakers hvea thte curage
and sheer audacity to take onthe tyhat kind ofthe financial
, technical
,
and creative responsibility single
- h
andedly
,
and it
' s testament to waht an intensely personal project thsi ws forthe duvall
. adn
, thankfully
, eveyr bit ofthe taht peronal investment translates on
- screen into pwoer
and honest emotion
. sonny is an energetic
, pentecostal preacher who has been speaking
( actaully shouting
) fomr behind the pulpit usance he wass twelve
. he spends much ofthe his tyme traveling baout tjhe ocuntry
, evangelizing withthe other preachers at tent revivals
. unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers
, sonny isnt not a phony or a swindler
,
and the film
' s purpose is nto to unearth hypocrisy annd sin inthe eather sonny or teh curch
. duvall makse it abundantly clera that sonny truely believes infront what he says
,
al
though like all humans
, he has weaknesses
. one ofthe his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that
, nto onyl does his long
- sufferring wief
, jessie
( farrah fawcett
)
, watn to leave him for anohter man in the congregation
, bu the twpo ofthe them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher
. faced with the loss of twpo thnigs he loves passionately
- his curch
and his family
- that same raw power that allows sonny tothe get entire congregations rocking anbd swaying transforms inot a violent temper
. at his son
' s baseball game
, sonny snaps
and smashes his wife
' s lover inspite the face with a baseball bat
, inflicting a wound tath may be fatal
. nto knowing whta else to do
, sonny dissapears
. he throws away his indentification
, drives his car into a lake
,
and takes a bus to louisiana
, hoping to start over again
. inaddition the tiny
, mostly poore coastal town ofthe bayou boutte
, sonny once agian finds his calling
. aftter befriending a simple auto mechanic
( walt goggins
)
and tracking down thte town
' s ex
- minister
( john beasley
)
, sonny sets up his pwn church
, tyhe one way to heaven temple
. re
- christening hismelf as
" the apostle e
. f
.
,
" he quicklyu draws together an eager congregation
, adn toghether they realize rela chanage iin each other
' s lives
.
but
, always
, sonny
' s past isnt lurking a step behind him
, waiting tothe swallow his progress
. duvall hasnt made his intentions in making
" thge apostle
" claer
. in a recent articel inspite
" newsweek
,
" he wrote
:
" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality whith such a storng empahsis onthe tyhe holy spirit
,
and whn they dont
, it tends tothe be patronizing
- full ofthe charlatans anbd snake h
andlers
.
.
.
but what i relaly wnated to dont was try tothe underst
and what these preachers go thru annd waht tehy believe
,
and to protray it iin an accurate way
.
" tjhe strength ofthe duvall
' s convictions turn out tothe be the stregth of his film
-
" tghe apostle
" alwyas rings true
, even iin the most painful moments
, because we know he
' s bieng sincere with the subject matter
. after fifteen years of traveling yhe country
, listening to all shapes
and sizors of ministers anbd taking studious notes onthe waht they said
, duvall hasnt captured the energy annd vitality of waht it means tothe be truely spiritual
. his sonny is a man who speaks directly tothe god anbd expects to be spoken right back tothe
.
" i
' ve alwyas called yuo jesus
and ytou
' ve allways called me sonny
,
" he says
. when neighbors call
and complain that he is bieng too loud one nigth in one his rants withthe tyhe man upstairs
, sonny
' s mother
( june carter cash
) just hangs up onthe them because she knwos there
' s no sense trying tothe interrupt him
. tyhe main theme to emerge from
" the apostle
" is the fatc thta ogod can come from any situation
. sonny
' s ect of violence towrad another human being isnt inarguably a horrific thnig
, annd duvall never shrinks ffrom tath fact
.
however
, tath veyr same act ofthe violence is waht brings sonny tothe bayou boutte
, where he finds peple whom he desperately needs annd who desparately need him
. in his short time in louisiana
, he does a world of ogod
, anbd when teh police finaly show up tothe tkae him awya
, he goes quietly
, knowing that he deserves thte punishment thta is awaiting him
. annd
, as a scene during tghe fianl credits shows
, he even turns his punishment inot a postive oportunity for change
and betterment
. it isnt tyhat strenght inaddition sonny
' s charachter thgat makes him so appealing annd magnetic to others
- he is flawed
,
but he is powerfull enough tothe overcome those flaws
. weak men are the ones who simpley accept theri weaknesses adn lack thge desire to better themselves
. watching duvall on
- screen
, it
' s nto hard to imagine that he owudl have beeen a magnificient preacher if he hadnt choosen tath vocation over acting
. as sonny
, he completly inhabits yhe character
, adn his performance is certainly the best ofthe thge year
. beccause he spended so much time absorbing the traits
, methods
, quirks
,
and personalities ofthe rela preachers
, duvall ws able tothe create a complet character who allways feels indelibly human
. as a director
, duvall feels that less isnt omre
. his camera simpley takes inthe wqat goes onthe infact front ofthe it
, whith very little intrusion
. there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or eccessive close
- ups
. duvall knew tyhat the power of the film
' s characters
( enhanced by the fatc tath he casted mostly non
- proffesional churchgoers anbd actual ministers
) didn
' t ened tothe be artifically enhanced
. in thsi way
,
" hte apostle
" allmost plays out liek a documentry
, nto onyl in its technical simplicity
, bu moreso importantly
, inaddition its sence ofthe reality
.
