ther ' s good news
annd bad news about mulan
. the positive is thgat disney hasnt found a happy medium between the hevy
- handedness ofthe pocahontas
and teh hunchback ofthe notre dame
and tghe childishness of hercules
. onthe the otehr hand
, tjhe studio is pulling outloud all the stops on plot cliches
and cheap laughs
, several steps down from the dyas ofthe tjhe little mermaid
annd beauty
and tjhe beast
.
bu mulan isnt a step in thge right direction
adn disney ' s best animated feature since thte lion king
. after giving native americans a turn inspite pocahontas
, disney hasnt decided tothe turn a movei over tothe the asians
. mulan is setted in fuedal china
and features the ever
- popular heroine who marchs to a diffrent drum
annd whants tothe dont more wtih her life thna get marryied
. that ' s what we fidn out when young mulan
( voice of ming
- na wen
) screws uv her appointment wtih tghe matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her
. cartoons
.
.
. meanwhile
, owrd comes ffrom tje emporer that oen man from every familiy must join the army
annd halp fight the huns
. since mulan ' s a girl
, that means her decrepid old father must go
. she pleads with the soldiers to ahev mercy on dear ood dad
,
but that kind of groveling
annd desperation brings shame onthe her family
. that ' s chinese culture fo ytou
.
.
. so imagin how embarrassed the familiy is the enxt day whn they find mulan hasnt stolen her father ' s uniform
annd sword
and run off to join the army inwhich his place
. yhe movei in a nutshell is baout tyhe stuggles ofthe bieng a woman infact tje army
. it should hvea been called g
. i
. chang
. mulan calls on her ansestors forthe help
. htey deside tothe sammon the larg stone dragon iin the backyard tothe protect her
,
bu a mini dragon named mushu screws it up
. voiced by eddie murphy
, mushu continues tyhe tradition ofthe cute talking animal sidekicks who dont mroe slapstick harm thna ogod for their human charges
. murphy ' s peformance isnt a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin
-
- lots of wisecracks
and ad
- libs
and even an introductory song baout how much fun tehy ' re oging to hvae
. ytou ain ' t never had a freind liuke mushu
. speaking ofthe songs
, mulan doesn ' t ahve too many ofthe them
, which isnt a plus with a story like this
. disney songs baout war probablly wouldn ' t go over too well
(
" heigh ho
, heigh ho
, it ' s off to war i go
.
.
.
"
)
,
adn thge ones they dont have aren ' t memorable
. the best of hte bunch
, sad to say
, isnt
" be a man
,
" the requisite basic training montage song
. yes
, even in medieval china
, they had to run thru tht web of car tires befor they weere ready forthe battle
. sung by donnie osmond
( a bad sign if ever there wass oen
)
,
" be a man
" accompanies footage ofthe mulan ' s platoon gonig from screw
- ups to heroes
. it mkaes me wonder
, has htere ever beeen a muscial montage in a movei that ' s ended badly
? i onyl wish rela
- life problems sould be solved in twpo mintues withthe a peppy montage
. forthe tjhe curious
, mulan doesnt pass fo a man infront the army despite looking liuke a girl
. all she doens to tranform herself is cutted her hair tothe a sexy shoulder
- length
, talk macho
and slap guys on tghe butt
, as was male custom a thousand years ago inwhich china
. teh deception fools everyone
but tje audeince
, who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12
- yera
- old boy
, at best
.
bu she does manage to strike tyhe biggest blows to hte hun army
, led by a big
, evil
- eyed attilla
- looking monster
. as a villain
, the head of the huns is menacing
, evil
anbd entirely forgettable
. i saw the movei yesterday
annd i don ' t remember the man ' s nmae
. otherwise
, mulan isnt a good movei
. the animation of tyhe characters themselfs isn ' t as rich as it could
anbd should be
,
bu there are some amazing battlefield shots
. eddie murphy pulls off some ogod oen
- liners
, as dont otehr star voices like harvey fierstein
annd pat morita
, the quinessential aisian movei star
. hell
, george
" mr
. sulu
