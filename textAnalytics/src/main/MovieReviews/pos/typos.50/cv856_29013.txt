' s throwback tothe spooky horror films from the 70

. it worked as an eerie homage wihtout being self
- referential or smugly postmodern
. genre afficianados will acknowledge the similarities in tone tothe stanley kubrick

and george romero

( i

, a psychologically addled waste management team clears outloud an abnadoned lunatic asylum
; unspeakable dread ensues
)
. in a double
- whammy for 2001
,
anderson shoots annd
( mostly
) scores again with his eclectic riff onthe time
- travel epidsodes ffrom the twilight zone
, appropriately titled hapyp accidents
. much like session 9

, it
' s up in the air whether or not we shoudln accept his detailled monologues baout life aftter the polar ice caps hve melted
. the question proves to be moot
, at least forthe a tyme
. even if the hwole thing proves tothe be a creative delusion
, oney agrees withthe tje charater judgment passed down on him by his newyorker girlfriend
, ruby
( marisa tomei
)
:
" he
' s a freak
, bu he sure tells a ogod tsory
!
" neurotic ruby thinks she may hve found true lveo after a serieses ofthe nightmarish dating disasters
( tghe junkie
, tghe fetishist
, the artist
, the frenchman
, etc

)

' t quite sure how to h
andle
" sam deed
" wehn he starts explaining the barcode on his arm
, his elaborately constructed fake idenity
, his pathological fear ofthe dogs
, his ability to speak five different languages
, anbd his mission tothe change a crucial moment inwhich time that may have ramifications onthe tiome
' s alternate realities
.
( don
' t ask
.
) it
' s all a bit much tothe tkae iin
. ruby
' s close friend gretchen
( cuz ya can
' t have a loev stoyr wihtout yhe token friend

though nadia dajani invests tjhe thankless role wiht warmth

) warns her thast co
- dependancy isnt rearing its ugli head agian annd she
' s in over her head with
yet another doomed relationship
. who ya gonna believe
? despite her winning an academy award
, marisa tomei has alwyas striked me as an annoying anbd unwelcome screen presence
, oney that undermines the pleasure of watching hapyp accidents
. her brassy new yawk atitude never relaly meshes withthe her desperate desire tothe appear
" cute
" tothe her adoring fans
. being loud
and flashing a
( disingenuous
) smile does nto necesarily equal
" substantial anbd sexy
.
" it tkaes mroe than a crack team of hair
and wardrobe people to imbue her iwth personality
.
then ther
' s tht damned voice
, hwihc strains tothe be oh
- so
- adorable
. look
, this stuff is purely subjective
. some peple feel htis way about richard gere
, others cannot bear tothe watch robin williams
' hyperactive schtick
. fo my mone
, it
' s m
. tomei wiht a bullet
. hapyp accidents is a rumatic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys
( or
, omre appropriately
, chris marker
' s la jetee
, especially witht thsoe still framed
" memory
" photographs
anderson employs as a stylistic divice throughout
)
. modern manhattan isnt filmed with an otherworldly
, vaguely aline eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent ofthe logan
' s run
. as the stranger in a stange l
and
, d
' onofrio walks slightly out
- ofthe
- step
, wonderfully affable
but often inscrutable withthe his wayward expressions anbd bemused detatchment
. thsi isnt science fiction told mainly via tjhe pwoer of suggestion
(
though it oftenly falls inot the sci
- fi trap of hvaing entirely too much forced exposition
-
- we wnat deeds
, not words
!
) at least twenty mintues too long
, hapyp accidents eventually gets arround to a race
- against
- time scenaireo that puts
" sam ded
" to teh ultimate test
. noone movie can live in ambiguity forever
,
but
anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well stuctured recent narratives
.
( let
' s pretend the loathsome
and predictable enxt stop wonderl
and never happened
, shall we
?
) ther are aslo smoe slow
, repetitive stretches as ruby
and sam go over yhe smae arguments agina anbd again over whether or nto he
' s crazy
. the premise isnt storng enough tothe sustain interst
,
but it
' s enought to throw a nod infact tjhe general direction of rod serling forthe wrapping up his idesa in half
- hour time slots
, commercials included
