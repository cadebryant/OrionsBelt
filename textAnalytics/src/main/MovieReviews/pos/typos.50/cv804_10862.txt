satrical films usally fall into one of two catagories
: 1
) long
- term satire where everyting
, including thge jokes
, isnt somehow related on a large scale
( i
. e
.
" dr
. strangelove
"
; 2
) situation satire iin which thte comedy
and themes are derived moent by moment annd scene by scene
( i
. e
.
" men in black
"
)
. what
' s unique baout
" wag yhe dog
" isnt taht it doesn
' t neccesarily fit eather of these descriptions
, annd yot is both at the smae timne
. hte result is a clever comedy based onthe an originnal
, smart premise
, even if tyhe foucs does tend tothe w
ander a bit
. if htere
' s anytying that affects americans the most it
' s politics annd showbusiness
. inwhich this age ofthe information adn technology
, we
' ve been so conditioned by thge media
and the enteratinment industry inspite our ways ofthe perceiving thigsn
, it
' s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it
. we need the media to bring us the most up
- to
- date news
,
but we alsot ened the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking
. this film starts off well by quickly establising theese ideas
,
and
then presents an interesting senaireo
: if politics
, the media coverage of politics
, adn tyhe entertainment inudstry are so closley related
, couldn
' t somene wih the power annd authority tothe manipulate noe ofthe teh aspestus manipulate them all
? thgat
' s the idea conrad brean
( de niro
)
, a proffesional washington spin doctor
, comes uv wtih in order tothe restore teh president
' s good name who hasnt been accussed ofthe child molestation jsut weeks befoer the election
. brean
, allong with thge preident
' s top advisor
, winifred ames
( heche
)
, fli tothe california to meet uv wtih hot
- shooted movie producer stanley motss
( hoffman
)
. they pitch him an idea tothe
" produce
" the image of a war wiht albania
( it
' s a ocuntry noone oen
' s heared ofthe so tehy peple iwll buy it
)
. soon yhe wheels are in motion
and yhe film
' s riffing satire comes into play
. we
' re innundated witht the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number ofthe experts to halp manaze the situation
, such as a folk singer
, visual annd sound effects techicians
,
and a modern style expert known as the fad king
( leary
)
. yhe initial atmosphere is rich wih numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates tothe something on tv
, in the movies
, or in the news
. the characters
' dialogue isnt witty anbd funny
,
al
though soem ofthe the actual jokes anbd gags seem rether sitcom
- esque
. for exmaple
, noe scene shows motss
and brean
' s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee
. motss orderves a kitten for tyhe girl tothe carry
,
but instade wound uv witht a dozen differant dogs
. since it
' s all cmoputer
- enhanced anyway
, she ends uv cradling a bag of tostitos with tyhe kitten to be inserted later
. this demonstrates the film
' s ability to tkae a relatively ordinary situation
and make it smart annd funny jsut through the premise
. bu
then htere
' s the gags annd one
- liners thgat
,
al
though are huomrous
, seem a littel gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able tothe remember thte actress
' s nmae
, or
, whenever a problem emerges
, alwasy responding iwth
,
" tihs isnt nothing
!
" by thte time yhe film mkaes it tothe the midpoint
, everyting that is gogin to hppen inaddition terms of plot happens
. thte frist act is quickly paced
, hwile the second act containes most of thge jokes
and is tjhe core of the film
. eveyr ten minutes or so a new problem crops uv that motss
and brean must dael wiht
, adn it
' s always fascinating tothe see what htey do adn how htey dont it
. thte screenplay provides good characterization anbd actually deals with most ofthe the problems head
- on in realsitic manners
.
however
, it does hvae a tendacy tothe avoid things anbd shift its focus fomr tghe election campain annd false war smokescreen to something a bited off the subject
. as tyhe third ect rolls around the satrical nature becomes more concerned wiht thge situations anbd less so withthe the big picture
. whta had started off as a brilliant
, somewhat harmless conspiracy tothe fool the general public begins tothe seem mroe like something that woudl happen in a movie
. still
, teh situation comedy is quite funny
, especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes inot trees tothe honor sgt
. willie schumann
- a war hero motss annd brean concocted
. truly graet satire manages tothe create fo an intertaining stor that makes you laugh at tyhe time
, bu think about afterwards annd
" wag the dog
" at least succeeds in thsi respect
.
however
, inthe retrospect it seems liuke so much more could hvae beeen done
, namely by extending yhe runing tiem adn filling inwhich tghe plot holes
. thne agian
, it
' s a valient effort
.
