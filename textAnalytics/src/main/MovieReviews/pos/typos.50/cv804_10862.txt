satrical films usally fall inot noe of two categories
: 1
) long
- term satire where everthing
, including thge jokes
, isnt somehow related on a large scale
( i
. e
.
" dr
. strangelove
"
; 2
) situation satire in which the comedy
and themes are drived moent by moent
anbd scene by scene
( i
. e
.
" men inwhich balck
"
)
. wqat ' s unique about
" wag the dog
" is that it doesn ' t necessarily ift eather of these descriptions
,
annd
yot is both at the same time
. the result is a clever comedy based on an orginal
, smart premise
, even if the foucs does tend tothe wander a bit
. if there ' s anything thast affects americans tjhe most it ' s politics
and showbusiness
. in this age of information
and technology
, we ' ve beeen so conditioned by thte media
annd the entertainment industry inwhich our ways ofthe perceiving thigns
, it ' s gotten tothe the point that we are practically controlled by it
. we need hte media tothe bring us the most uv
- to
- date news
,
bu we allso ened the escapism of hollywood to counter all taht thinking
. tihs film starts off well by quicklyu establising theese ideas
,
and
thne presents an interesting scenario
: if politics
, thge media coverage of politics
,
anbd the entertainment industry are so closely realted
, couldn ' t someone wtih teh power
and authority to manipulate noe ofthe tje aspestus manipulate them all
? that ' s the idea conrad brean
( de niro
)
, a proffesional washington spin doctor
, comes up with infront order to restore the president ' s good name who has beeen accused of child molestation just weeks befor the elction
. brean
, along with tje preident ' s top advisor
, winifred ames
( heche
)
, fli to califronia to meet up wih hot
- shooted movie producer stanley motss
( hoffman
)
. they pitch him an idea tothe
" produce
" thge image of a war with albania
( it ' s a ocuntry no oen ' s heard of so tehy peopel will buy it
)
. soon the wheels are inthe motion
and the film ' s riffing satire comes into play
. we ' re innundated wiht the hollywood mind setted as motss brings infact a number of experts tothe halp manaze thge situation
, such as a folk singer
, visual
adn sound effects techicians
,
adn a modern style expert known as thte fad king
( leary
)
. tghe initial atomsphere is rich wiht numberous pop culture refernces where everyting somehow relates tothe something on tv
, inwhich yhe movies
, or in yhe news
. thge cahracters ' dialogue isnt witty
annd funny
, altho some of tjhe actuall jokes
adn gags seem rether sitcom
- esque
. fo exemple
, oen scene shows motss
and brean ' s prodcution crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee
. motss orderves a kitten forthe tghe girl to cary
,
bu instead wound up wtih a dozen diffrent dogs
. usance it ' s all cmoputer
- enhanced anyway
, she ends up cradling a bag ofthe tostitos wtih the kitten to be inserted later
. htis demonstrates tghe film ' s abilty tothe tkae a relativly ordinary situation
annd mkae it smart
adn funny jsut through the premise
.
but
thn there ' s the gags
and oen
- liners thast
,
altough are humorou
, seem a littel gratuitious in yhe long run such as motss nto being able to rember the actress ' s name
, or
, whenever a probelm emerges
, always responding withthe
,
" this is nothing
!
" by the time the film makes it tothe the midpoint
, everthing thast is oging to hapen inthe terms ofthe plot happens
. tghe firt act isnt quicklyu paced
, while the second ect contains most of the jokes
and isnt the core ofthe tyhe film
. eveyr ten minutes or so a new probelm crops uv tath motss
and brean must deal with
,
anbd it ' s alwasy fascinating to see what tehy dont
and how they do it
. yhe screenplay provides good characterization
annd actually deals with most ofthe the problems head
- onthe inaddition realsitic manners
.
however
, it does have a tendacy tothe avoid thnigs
and shift its focus from thte election campaign
and false war smokescreen tothe something a bit off thge subject
. as hte third act rolls arround the satirical nature becomes mroe concerned wtih yhe situations
and less so witht the big picture
. wqat had started off as a brilliant
, somewhat harmless conspiracy tothe fool the general public beggins to seem more liuke something that would happn inspite a movie
. still
, the situation comedy is qtuie funny
, especially a montage showing the entire ocuntry flinging old shoes inot trees tothe honor sgt
. willie schumann
- a war hero motss
and brean concocted
. truly great satire manages tothe create fo an entertaining story tyhat makes yuo laugh at the timne
,
but htink about afterwords
annd
" wag the dog
" at least succeeds inthe this respect
.
however
, in retrospect it seems like so much more could have beeen done
, namely by extending tghe runnung time
annd filling in teh plot holes
.
hten agina
, it ' s a valient affort
.
