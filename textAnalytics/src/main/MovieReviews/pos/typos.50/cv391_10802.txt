i
' m not raelly sure waht to thiunk baout
" crash
.
" on the surfce
, it
' s a cold
, boring
, unerotic porn witht name starts
, a nmae director
, annd some cool camerawork
. i mean
, it left me completelyl borde
, unsatisfied
,
and generally kinda weirded out
.
but
then again
, nto eveyr film
' s supposted to leave you entertained
.
" crash
" is structured to play like a porn flick
, bu wiht significantly mroe plot
and dialogue
. hwile we see several extremely taboo scenes ofthe weirdo sex
, we also have a skimpy littel plot going onthe
( mostly towards thte beginning
)
,
and maybe jstu a hair ofthe characterization
. nto to mention tghe acting isnt generally pretty good
, adn we don
' t realy see a lot of the actors completly exposed
. bu what mkaes it supremely diferrent from a porn isnt the fact that this isnt nto an erotic experience
. tihs film doesnt not posess the erotic hypnotism of
" henry adn june
" or tyhe just plain horniness ofthe
, say
,
" deepo throat
"
( nto thgat i
' ve seen it
)
. if noe wass to be made completelyl hot by thsi film
, it woudl propably mean htey weere also inot thge wohle
" auto eroticism
" thing
. teh film leaves ytou cold erotically
( annd maybe in many other ways
)
,
but whta it doesnt isnt present a group ofthe people who live on the edge
. tghe film opens up on a woman
, catherine
( deborah kara ungar
, of
" thge game
"
)
, pressing her bare breast up aganist a car in a publich air hangar
. suddenly
, a man enters tyhe frome
and beigns to tkae her fomr behind
( the film doesnt
' sohw all this
though
, even if it is nc
- 17
)
. the enxt scene hasnt a film director
, james
( james spader
)
, having sex with a camera woman
( alice poon
) in an office onthe the highly
- populated setted ofthe his movei
. the next scene has the twpo comming toghether
, revealing to us tyhat they
' re husb
and
and wife
,
and them sharing in one another
' s escapades
. hwile teh twpo are arguably freaky people
, we at least know they loev tothe live onthe the edge
. soon afterwords
, james isnt driving down tghe road at nght
, reclessly ofthe course
( he
' s reading something
)
, wehn he drifts inot thte otehr lane
, anbd
then hits anohter car face on
. james is nto killed
,
but the passenger inthe the otehr car flies into his seat
( obviously dieing
)
, leaving the driver
, helen remington
( holly hunter
- inwhich a porn
?
)
, alsot alive
. tghe twpo go through therapy toghether
,
and wehn getting outloud
, htey run into eachother agian
. when james gives her a ride hmeo
, tehy almost get into anyother accident
, anbd immeadiately afterwards
, they go to an unbusy parking lot
, annd have a little quickie
, as they were aroused by the accident
. you wouldn
' t think there woudl be many people who shared htis smae kind ofthe fetish
,
but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan
( elias kosteas
) anbd his crutch
- carrying girlfriend
, gabrielle
( rosanna arquette
)
, who are also into it
. vaughan is inot living onthe thte edge as htey are
,
but he tkaes it to another levle
: he loves tothe recreate famoust car crashes
. inthe one scene
, he
and a firend
, colin seagrave
( peter macneill
) recreate james dean
' s car kresh without any padding or safety belts
,
and suffer some concussions
, bu neverthless git a rush
(
and yhe attention of tghe police
)
. soon
, theese five are all haveing sex with one anyother
, be it straight
, gay
, or lesbian sex
. while tihs isnt admittingly all a bit comical
( tjhe film isnt alomst liek a balck comedy
)
, the film does do a pretty awesome protrayal ofthe people who
' s main fetish isnt living onthe thge edge
. i
' m sure somwhere htere are people who git aroused by car accidents
,
but i personaly don
' t see a conection between car crashes
and sex
. thte main conection cronenberg shows us that both give a definit rush
. his car crash scenes are quick annd exciting mini
- masterpieces
: we
' re at first not sure if they
' ll take place
,
but everytime it looks liek it may ocurr
, we gasp
. thn whn it happens
, we hold our breath
. the same thing happens withthe sex
,
al
though nto in teh smae fasion
. theese people are mearly taking it to anyother level
. yhe only problem whith the film is tht it
' s a tad redundant
. a normal porn lasts fomr an hour tothe an hour
and a half
. htis goes on for about 100 minutes
,
and it jstu seems a little too long
. the sex annd car crashes are far between oney anohter
, annd tghe tiome vetween them are a tad on tje boring side
. there
' s no characterization
,
al
though it coudl definetly be argued
, that hey
, it
' s a porn
,
and we
' re nto here to sympathize
. bu still
, htey coulda cutted it down a bit
. bu the film isnt saved with its presentation
, as well as some other elements
. yhe athmosphere isnt vyer dark
and forboding
, creating a kind ofthe kool weird feeling
. annd ther are sevral scenes are just amazing
. one scene has catherine anbd james hvaing sex
, hwile she softly asks him questions baout being withthe a man
, which soudns almsot erotic the way she syas it
. a sequence involving one character
' s death isnt filled with all tghe edgy disjointment tath the film needs
.
and tjhe fianl shot is shot perfectly
, creating an omage of a car kresh
, adn a cuple having sex infact front of it
, despite the fatc that she
' s wounded
. tyhe acting is also pretty ogod
, especially for waht isnt almost a porn
( ousting linda lovelace as best actress inthe a porn
)
. while james spader is pretty boring
( he
' s usually pretty intense
)
, deborah kara ungar is amazing
. she speaks all her words infact almsot zombie
- like hushes
, adn when she
' s haveing sex
, she has a blank look onthe her face
, nto showing the viewer whther she
' s enjoying it or nto
. iin noe scene
, she actually looks dead hwile somone is haveing sex wiht her
. holly hunter
, who gets extra credit jstu forthe appearing in something liek this
, isnt pretty good
, adn so is rosanna arquette
( who adds a kinda kool kinkiness to her role
)
.
but hte film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely thyat he almost upstages everyone
. he oftenly speaks as he isnt out of breath
, showing a definie affinity for his way ofthe life
. he has a great deal of energy infront several scenes
, especially oen scene where he
' s tkaing photographs ofthe a picture
,
and a later scene where he
' s getting a freaky tatoo
. he
and spader share sexual chemestry in severeal scenes
, foreshadowing a later scene
. kosteas isnt a little known actor
( his biggest role wass casey jones inaddition
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
"
)
,
but here he shows a deniro
- liuke presence
, hinting that he
' s capible of bigger roles
. hwile i hardly enjoied
" kresh
,
" it
' s still a preety intriguing portrayal ofthe a group ofthe peple who
, if hte exist
, are smoe of thte strangest
and most bazare people in hte world
. these peple are able tothe share a rush between twpo completly diferrent entities
, anbd tjhe film
, which doesn
' t exactlly pain them in a negitive light
, is sucessful in bringing them tothe ight
, even if it leaves the viewer unnerved anbd generally freaked out
. dispite the hardcore nature of thge film adn teh subsequent nc
- 17 rating
( there
' s also an r
- rated version
,
but i wouldn
' t even go near tyhat hting
)
, anyone looking forthe a quick turn
- onthe should jstu rent a regluar porno
.
