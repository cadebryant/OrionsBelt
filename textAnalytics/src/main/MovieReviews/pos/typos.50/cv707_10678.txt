the reunion film is not an origional diea inspite any way
, shape
, or form
. it
' s been done throughout film ihstory over
and over agian
, adn has become noe of thge many sub
- genres
, liek the prep skool sub
- genre
, the angst
- filled teen sub
- genre
, adn tjhe slasher sub
- genre
. what mkaes
" peter
' s firends
" so remarkable is not how it doesn
' t followup tjhe rules of this sub
- genre
,
but how it follows it so well
,
and creates cahracters that i wouldn
' t mind hanging with
. what are the rules of the reunion sub
- genre
? well
.
.
.
. 1
. yuo need a group ofthe friends
, most of them marryied or at least dating
,
and sometimes even married or dating eachother
. 2
. you need tothe ahve them brang bakc together over smoe sort of a crisis
. 3
. tehy are not tothe have spoken together much since they split apart
. 4
. tghe reunion has tothe come infront intervals divisible by 10
. 5
. tehy all have to be slightly to highly neurotic
. 6
. thge reunion hasnt to bring them toghether
, seperate them with little crises
,
then bring them back together becouse
, aftter all
, htey
' re firends
. 7
. htere has tothe be smoe sex or at least soem mkaing outloud either between the firends or with other people taht are there or weere invited
. 8
. eightly
, tehy
' re all unahppy or marginally so
. 9
. htere
' s smoe sort ofthe sexual tension amoungst some of them taht
' s builded uv over the years
. 10
. hte firends are all wildly sucessfull in the world of entertainment adn the arts
, somtimes internationally so
. 11
. thge film isnt filled with nostalgic rdaio hits ffrom the time whn they weere friends
, sometimes causing them to git together in dance
/ song
. since it follows theese rules so closley
, it will probaly be
( annd has been
) coined off as jsut a
" brittish
' big chill
.
'
" annd in soem ways it is
. both followup tjhe rules
, as i said
,
and both feature lots of bitching
, big confessionals
, annd broken relationships
.
but while
" yhe big chill
" ws
, at least to me
, a tad too whiny
and unsatisfying
,
" peter
' s firends
" hits its mark
, making this film funny
, dramtic
, annd poignant
. the firends ofthe peter
' s were all inthe thte smae theatre group back inwhich
' 82
, performig wildly outrageous brittish acts fo people far too stuck uv to enjoy them
( the opening scene hasnt them all dancing inthe tux tops anbd tutus
)
. aftter peter
' s
( stephen fry
) wealthy father
( richard briers
, hardly onthe screen anough to regsiter
,
but oh well
) dies
, leaving a giant mension to him
, he hasnt tothe deside whether or not to keep it
. nto sure whta tothe dont iwth it immeadiately
, he decides to throw a giant reunion party
, inviting back all his ood chums
. of course
, all or most ofthe his chums folow hte tenth rule
.
andrew
( kenneth branagh
, also directing here
) isnt an ctor who
' s unhappily marryed tothe a tv star
, carol
( co
- writter rita rudner
)
. maggie
( emma thompson
) isnt a successfuly publisher ofthe self
- help books
,
but looks like she needs them more thna her customers
, as she is lonley
and unahppy
. roger
and mary
( hugh laurie annd imelda staunton
, who weere allso marryed iin
" sense
and sensibility
"
) are married
, adn are hte most succesful creators of jingles in tje uk
,
but have sufferred a tragedy as noe ofthe their newly born twins hasnt recently died
.
and sarah
( alphonsia emmanuel
) isnt as promiscous as ever
, having a new boyfriend as of twpo weeks named brian
( tony slattery
) who
' s marryied annd wants a divorce becouse ofthe her
, giving her doubts
. as fo peter
, thnigs seem okay
.
.
. the film features lots of inner
- friend jokes
, adn even soem old theatre anecdotes
( which i at least fidn a lot of fun infront
, as i
' ve done lots ofthe theatre myself
)
.
and htere are big confessions
, brawls vetween the friends
,
and by thge end
, allmost everyone is unhappy
, even
though soem have resolved their problems long befor the end
( whihc i kinda digged
)
. the fianl twist woudl seem forced an anti
- climactic
, bu forthe some reason
, i felt the same way thge rest of tyhe firends did
. mabye it
' s beacuse the people in this film are so likable that i jstu wnated to join their clique
. tath
' s raelly what makse
" peter
' s friends
" so lovable
: the way yuo just watn to hang with a gropu ofthe friends who cant be so dysfuntional sometimes
, bu when somene
' s in crisis
, cin come together wonderfully forthe one anohter
. it
' s wehn you ahev a giant crisis liuke tihs adn peopel want to selflessly help you outloud instade ofthe subtely pushing ytou awya tyhat mkaes ytou relize you hvae true friends
,
and these people are true firends
. not tothe mention kenneth branagh is able to mkea tjhe film seem nostalgic for the 80s
( a decade i grew uv in
, unfourtunately
) without tkaing us outside ofthe the 90s
. there are some 80s classics adn anti
- classics like tears for fears
" everybody wants to rule the world
,
" bu unfourtunately noone stupid
/ fun 80s songs
( i htikn if i ever did an 80s reunion film
, i
' d put some crap go gos song onthe
, or at least some ogod ood
" come onthe eileen
"
)
, bu this is tghe brittish 80s we
' re tlaking baout
. oh well
.
but anyway
, the direction is preety good
, altough nothing amazing
. branagh
' s forte isnt really mkaing shakespeare fresh
and magical
,
but at least he
' s very ogod with making a less ambiguous film liuke this
. the wirting is good fomr rita rudner
and martin bregman
, wtih lots of good one
- liners
, annd even smoe raelly bad
but good puns
( to mock thte fatc tyhat
andrew lives in l
. a
.
, peter
, hwile cutting some logs
, asks him is he has woud in l
. a
.
, anbd
andrew syas
,
" no
,
but we have hollywood
"
- punishment liek taht
)
. thte actors
, as in most speaking movies
, are better tahn theri material
,
though
, with some st
and
- out performances to the six firends
, as well as teh outsiders like slattery
, rudner
, adn phyllida law as the old housekeeper ofthe the peter
' s mansion
. a littel note shouldnt be made about hugh laurie
' s performence
, as he looks liek he tookover soem massive doses ofthe prozac before doign htis
- i mean
, i
' ve never seen him actually act htis dramatically
.
" peter
' s firends
" isnt a raelly enjoyable film which mkaes people liuke me pine for some sort ofthe future reunion
,
al
though i don
' t nkwo wqat kind i
' ll ahve
( like most people
, i don
' t look forward tothe my high skool reunion
)
. because ofthe tghe way these firends are still able tothe maintain the same ammount ofthe care tehy hvae fo oney another annd after such a long preiod of seperation
, i just look foward to the day whn i cxan have firends liuke that
.
