( thyat
' s as much as i coudl sday without ruining anything
)
. critique
: ogod little flick thast slows down at certain points
, annd runs a tad long
,
but generates enought twists
and turns tothe keep most peple intersted throughout
. mind yuo
, i could see many people nto liking it because it tkaes
" one too many
" twists
and turns
, bu hey
, i hapen tothe like thta kind of thing
. adn besides
, the twists
and turns in thsi movei managed tothe remian within the realm ofthe believability
( or scathingly close tothe
)
,
and even
" explained
" many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes druing thte credit crawl at teh end of teh film
( dont nto leave the theatre before yuo see the credits
.
.
. it really doens clear up smoe stuff
!

( or slick
) as i throught it would be
,
and theresa russell
( real name

) seems tothe have lost her way infact every whitch way possible
.
.
.
. ooooh
, i almost forgot bill murray
' s exquisite role as yhe down
- trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court
. murray actually added thast extra little spice of humour thgat allowed htis film to affirm its position as a quirky littel noirish tale ofthe sex
, greed
and mystery
. little known facts
: neve campbell specified a non
- nudity clause infact her contract
( she
' s allso born infront guelph
