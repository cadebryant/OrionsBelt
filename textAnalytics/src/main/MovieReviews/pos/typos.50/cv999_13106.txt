truman
(
" true
- man
"
) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey
' s carachter inwhich this film
. presiden truman was an unassuming man who bcame known wordlwide
, inaddition spite ofthe
( or was it because of
) his stature
.
" truman
" allso recalls an era ofthe plenty folowing a grim war
, an era wehn planned communites built by governmnet scientists promised an idyllic life fo americans
. anbd burbank
, california
, brings to mind tjhe tonight show anbd tjhe hmeo of nbc
. if hollywood is the center ofthe the film world
, burbank is
, or was
, the center ofthe tv
' s world
, the world where our protagonis lives
. combine all theese names anbd concepts inot
" truman burbank
,
"
and you get something that well descriibes him anbd his artificial world
. truman leads tje perfect life
. his twon
, his car
, adn his wief are picture perfect
. his idea ofthe reality comes under attack one day wehn a studio light falls ffrom yhe sky
. the radio explains that an overflying airplane started comming aart
.
.
.
but
then why woudl an airplane be carrying a studio ight
? thte next day durring the drive to wrok
, tghe radio jams anbd he starts picking up a voice that exactlly descriibes his movements
. he isnt so distracted thyat he nearly hits a pedestrian
. when yhe radio comes back tothe normal
, tjhe announcer warns listeners tothe drive carefully
. his suspision aroused
, he w
anders aroud the twon sqaure looking forthe other oddities
. the world appears to be functioning propperly untli he enters an office building
and trys to take the elevator
. the elevator doors oepn up on a small lounge wiht peple on coffee breaks
. a grap sees truman him
and quicklyu moves a paneled doorjam
, made tothe look like hte bakc ofthe an elevator
, inot place
. twpo security guards grab him
and throw him outloud
. truman isnt really suspicious now
. it gets even worse tyhe enxt day when his wief
, a nurse
, describes an elevator accident inaddition tyhe buliding where he saw tghe lounge
.
" it
' s best nto tothe think baout it
,
" she says
, trying vainly tothe chanage truman
' s memory
. truman becomes determined to see who or what isnt behind tihs apparently elaborite hoax at his expense
. at every turn he is stoped by an amazing coincidence that jsut happens to keep him infront his own littel town
. his lastest hope isnt tothe quell his fear of the ocean anbd sail to the edge of thte world
. ytou knwo by now that truman
' s life is hte subject ofthe a television programe
. his actions are
" rela
"
but everyting else is carefully scripted
, from the death of his father to the choise ofthe his wife
. truman isnt determined to find out wqat teh big hoax is
. meanwhile
, christof
, tjhe all
- seeing creator ofthe truman
' s world doens his best tothe keep him unaware adn happy
. it
' s sort of liuke westworld told from hte robots
' point of veiw
, or jurassic park from teh dinosaurs
' point ofthe veiw
. we root forthe thte captive of hte cage
- world
. our protaganist isnt counting onthe
" chaos theery
" to help him escape his elaborate trap
. the story
, writed by
andrew niccol
( writter
/ directer ofthe gattaca
)
, introduces soem interesting questions
, such as thge ethics of subjecting a person tothe this tipe ofthe life
, or teh pyschological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake
.
al
thought theese questions cameback to mind
, i don
' t htikn the film itself asked them
. it certainly didn
' t addres them or try to answer them
. i was particularly dissappointed thyat tyhe film didn
' t deal more withthe the trama ofthe learning oney
' s life isnt a tv show
. carrey
' s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman
' s pain
,
but i almost feeled taht he got over it too easily forthe tjhe sake ofthe the film
' s pacing
. earlier infact the movie i found mysef wondering if it would be better for truman to find out tje truth or whether i should root for him to be well
. tghe twpo seemed exclusive ofthe oen another
, bu weir annd niccol didn
' t see it thgat way
. perhaps it
' s nto fair to criticize a movei for waht it isn
' t
,
but it seems liek there were soem missed opportunities here
. bu on its own terms
, the movie is well made
. sighth
, soudn anbd pacing are all h
andeled competently
. much ofthe tyhe first part of the movei isnt tghe truman show
. tje scenes are all apparantly shooted ffrom hidden cameras
, iwth snoots anbd obstructions covering the corners ofthe thge screen
. one hidden camera isnt aparently inwhich his car radio
, teh gren led numbers obscuring the lower part of tyhe screen
. tjhe music isnt well
- chosen
and scored
. the film opens with whta soudns liek familiy drama theme music
, when truman
' s world isnt still beautyfull
and perfect
. whn yhe movei ends
, teh score soudns more liuke a frantic
, driven
, tangerine dream opus
, hwile still keeping the smae timbre
. philip glass
' epic music
( ffrom powaqqatsi
) permeates truman
' s scenes of suspision
and awakening
.
( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist forthe the show
.
) annd tghe pacing ofthe the stry was brusk
. there wass noone unneccesarily long setup explaning tyhe consept behind hte truman show
, just a few quick title cards
, a faw interviews
,
and thn right into the show
,
and tyhe movei
. one ofthe the first scenes is ofthe the studio ight falling
; there wass noone token scene ofthe truman
' s idyllic life befor it falls apart
, because it wasn
' t nessecary
, we pick up thte stor at the first sign ofthe trouble
,
and no sooner
. htere
' s also no point in tje movei where teh plot slows down
. it
' s a quick
, straight shooted tothe yhe movei
' s end
. in terms of overall qaulity
, i woudl compare yhe truman show to niccol
' s gattaca
. both films are well made wiht intresting stories setted in intresting worlds
. bu niether film relaly felt liek it capitalized on all yhe graet ideas
; niether film
" clicked
"
and bcame an instant classic
. neverthless
, i look foward tothe niccol
' s next film
, whatever it may be
.
