fo many peple
, procrastination isn
' t a probelm tothe overcome
, it
' s a high art
. we
' ll dont jsut baout anytying tothe put off a task
. when tje deadline fo thsi olumn nears
, it
' s thge onyl time durring the week dishes get washed
and the bed made adn laundry done
and plants watered
and
.
.
. eventually
, hopefully
, somtimes
, there
' s a breakthrough annd we actually get down to wokr
. amazingly it
' s almost alwasy easier thna we dreaded
and aftter finishing
, that sense ofthe oppressive apprehension melts away
.
and hten
, the enxt tiem
, we dont it all agian
. english proffesor grady tripp
( michael douglas
) isnt a master
. seven years ago
, his firt book wass a hitted
. he
' s been working on his second
-
- a short 200
- page peice
-
- since
then
. fearful that he cin
' t live uv to yhe frist
, he cin
' t bring himself tothe finish it
. no writer
' s block
, he
' s nearing 3
, 000 pages with no end inthe sighth
. nowe he
' s hvaing a particlarly difficult day
. the college
' s anually writers conferance is bringing iin accomplished novelists reminding tripp thta otehr people are finishing
_ their
_ books
. during thge frist day
, his wife hasnt left him
, his married girlfriend informs him she
' s pregnant anbd his agent isnt in twon whith a six
- foot transvestite in tow
. by the evening
, our besieged writter is driving
though tje snow
- covered streets of pittsburgh wiht a suicidal student beside him
, a stolen jacket taht marilyn monroe wore onthe her wedding day infront teh back seat anbd a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk
. this could be a pivotal point in his mid
- life crisis
.
and thne htere
' s tghe enxt morning
. there
' s a lot to liuke about this movie
. ther are no huge explosions
, shattering glass or computer
- generated rinosarus to distract from the vyer rela human issues
. grady is caught uv in yhe curse of people who acomplish great things eary inspite their career
. inthe the world of
" wqat have you done for me lately
?
"
, he konws his second book hasnt to be better than his first
. instead ofthe finding out
, he drifts
, comfortable inaddition hte insular cocoon ofthe acadmic peter panhood
. he doesn
' t have much of a life
and niether does his star pupil james leer
( tobey maguire
)
. james may be suicidal annd psychotic
. certainly everthing taht comes outloud of his mouth is a lie
. he makse up a past ofthe wokring clash anguish because tjhe truth of wealth annd comfort just isn
' t intresting enough
. as tje weekend progresses
, tehy are both forced tothe fully engage life
. that
' s tjhe question tehy must face
: comfort or rela experiences
? yhe film tkaes soem intresting chances
. non
- traditionnal relationships are presented as marter
- of
- fact
. extra
- marital
, gay
, interracial
, professor
- student
: here they aren
' t judged
, mearly choices
. the actors are all first
- rate
. douglas triumphs
, palying agaisnt tipe as he spends most of his time disheveled
, unshaven adn clad in a pink womens
' s house robe
. maguire
' s disengaged alienation works perfectly here
. robert downey jr
. as grady
' s agent livens up his scenes
. directer curtis hanson
(
" l
. a
. confidencial
"
) mkaes a faw missteps
. tyhe women are underused
. frances mcdorm
and doesnt a ogod job ofthe her limited role ofthe sara
, grady
' s married lover
but we never underst
and much of who she isnt
. the chemistry between tghe twpo ofthe them isnt non
- existant whcih makse some ofthe the ending unconvincing
. katie holmes isnt a student with a major crush onthe hte profesor
, bu her character goes nowhere
. we never even see grady
' s exiting wief
. thsi is very much a guy
' s film
. thge varied relationships bewteen yhe men are much more convincing than any of tghe others
. grady
' s alternating mentoring
and rejection ofthe james isnt the centerpoint ofthe the film
, nto him
and sara
. as the boomers age
, expect tothe see more mid
- life crisis films to catch hte attention ofthe thyat demographic
. eventualy it
' ll probably become cliche
,
but right nowe we
' ve got a winner
. i
' ll finish this in a second
. right nowe i have tothe grab soem paint
. i noticed soem trim in the otehr room that needs a little touch
- up
