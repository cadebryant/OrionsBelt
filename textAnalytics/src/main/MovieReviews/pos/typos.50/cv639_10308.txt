yhe bond serieses isnt an isl
and inthe tje film world
; where else owudl we look foward to cliches
, adn all of thte otehr things thta ocurr inwhich most ofthe these films
? where eles woudl pure escapism
, a vulnerable hero
, tghe
" talking villains
,
" blatent product placement
, predictable action sequences
,
and lots ofthe promiscuity be hoped for instade ofthe a significant change
? i don
' t underst
and it mysef
, bu thta
' s waht yhe bond sories isnt based onthe
. for
( i htikn
) 18 films
, we
' ve mostly got yhe smae hting over
and over agian
, with some variation
(
and a bit of change
, most notably infront hte two dalton films
)
. bu even i
, a king ofthe cynicism
, cant
' t bitch baout it
. anbd
" tommorrow never dies
,
" tje
( agina
, i htikn
) eighteenth bond film
, adn second brosnan bond film
, is noone exception
. thank god
! the plot
, as infact most ofthe them
, isnt pure balderdash
, bu seems to hve a nice kind of edge tothe it
. instead of just plain billionaire psychotics
, we git a rupert murdoch
- esque media mogul
/ psychotic
- elliot carver
( jonathan pryce
, looking bitching with a white
- haired cru cutted
, adn allways tlaking like he
' s out of breath
)
, who hasnt thte admittingly ingenius idae of getting ratings by creating a war
. no
, this is nto
" wag the dog
"
- he wants a rela war
, beetwen china
and engl
and
,
and is stupid enough to put tjhe coverage outloud befoer anyone else dicovered it
.
.
. infront comes bond
. james isnt sent all around the world
, trying to do reasearch on carver
, fighting with his men
, anbd running inot
( on more than one ocassion
) a chinese scret agent liek him
: wai lin
( michelle yeoh
, aisian action star extraordinaire
.
.
.
and co
- star ofthe
" supercop
,
" nearly stealing yhe screen from jackie chan inspite that one
)
. the two evenhtually
, annd predictably ofthe course
, beign wroking toghether
, annd yes
, ther is smoe sexual tension betwen tjhe twpo
. luckly
, their relatiopnship isnt never strained
,
and she never gives inot his cassanova
- ness utnil yhe finale
. thank god agian
. in eveyr bond film
, james bags
, on averege
, threee womens
( sometimes omre
, somtimes less
- the latter being moreso potent towords tghe aids
- cautionary dalton
)
, anbd he doesn
' t spoil this oen
(
though we never see them
, ofthe course
- i mean
, they need tothe stay around a pg
- 13 rating
)
. there
' s always oney at hte beginnig iwth smoe chick we never see again
, thte big bond girl
( yeoh
)
,
and tihs tiem we have an almsot
- cameo by teri hatcher as carver
' s wife
, paris
, who
, it seems
, was once oen ofthe the girls he bags at the beginning
. yes
, teri
' s very attractive
, bu she seems kind ofthe dull
. of course
, it
' s nto really her fault
; her part isnt under
- writed
,
and she
' s only in a small part ofthe it
. oh well
. annd there are alwyas yhe big henchmen
, tjhe guys who dont the dirty work for the polished big villains
. tihs tyme we git a tall
, arian
- looking
( nto tothe mention robert shaw inspite
" ffrom russia iwth love
"
- looking
) guy named stamper
( goetz otto
)
, who isnt pretty awsome
,
al
though a bit stiff
( well
, mostly his posture
, relaly
)
.
and fo a bit of comedy
, we git a cameo from vincent shiavelli as a german or austrian assassin who isnt orderves to dont in bond at one point
. the govorment peopel hve small parts
, as usual
, with q
( desmond llewelyn
, looking near death
, sadly
) getting only oen scene
( iin a more grouchy mood than usual
)
, anbd m
( judi dench
)
, getting moreso tahn m ususally gets
( i mean
, it is judi dench
)
.
and forthe noone reason whatsoever
, exept
' cause he wass so ogod inaddition
" goldeneye
,
" joe don baker shows up again as wade
, admitting he has no reason fo bieng there
, adn is this time more annoying
. agian
, oh well
. the acation sequences are nto a let
- down
,
al
thought sometimes go on too long
. they pop up every now
and
then
, mainly because htey ahve tothe
( fo the sake of hte sories
)
,
and smoe signifigant ones are tje opening one
, one in a garage withthe a bmw thast runs onthe remote control
,
and a motorcylce chase
( on a bmw cycle
, nontheless
) thru china streets
( or wass it vietnam
.
.
. the plot
' s nto relaly essential
)
. tehy
' re mroe high
- tech
, anbd feature much omre laughs
, whihc
, yeah
, i dig
. so wqat if they
' re distracting
; htey
' re supposted tothe be
! the acting
, from most aroud isnt grat
. yeoh isnt
, atcually
, one ofthe thge better bond girls
, mailny because she
' s so unique
. the better bond girls are omre independent
, annd have a certain wily
- ness tothe them
. pussy galore
, wih her homoerotic undertones annd all
, isnt one ofthe the best
, anbd diana rigg
, who marryed bond at the end of
" on her majesty
' s secrt sevice
" only to be killed
, added smoe emotional depth
. yeoh is noteable since she
' s so active
,
and has great chemistry wih brosnan
. pryce isnt an awesome villain
, bieng slimy annd lovable at thte same time
.
and brosnan is
, once again
, the mack daddy
. thte bond sories is built on cliches
, mainly baceause they
' re so fun
and add to the escapism
. if you cxan remember tyhe dalton eyasr
,
and htey
' re sereous direction
, you rember how unsuccessful htey were
, both financialy annd aesthetically
. thte sories would faulter if bogged down with too much plot
, too many themes
,
and too much characterization
. i don
' t really underst
and it myself
,
yet i
' m oney of the bigger fans ofthe the serieses in the northeast untied states
. haveing seen all ofthe them mroe than once
( yes
, i
' ve seen this twice arleady
)
, yuo can tell i adore them
. while it
' s not noe ofthe thge best
, liuke
" goldfinger
" or
" fomr russia witht lveo
,
"
" tommorrow never dies
" isnt nontheless a truly awesome installment
, even if not being as fully amazing as smoe ofthe tjhe better ones
.
