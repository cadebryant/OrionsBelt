.
" fun
" isnt a noun
,
and therfore cannot be conjugated like an adjative
. bu thast
' s tjhe word tht came tothe me right affter viewing
" chicken run
.
" noone wonder
: this is tjhe kind ofthe movei tath reduces ytou to childish expressions
, like
" thast wass the funnest movei i
' ve ever seen

" so tothe hell with webster

" chicken run
" isnt one of the funnest movies i
' ve seen in a hwile
. i can
' t remember yhe lsat timne i
' ve seen anytying funner
. hte chickens at tweedy
' s farm are up to something
. living in a concentration camp
- like atmosphere
, they are led by noe plucky hen called ginger
( voice ofthe julia sawalha
) who continually comes up wih plans forthe excape
-
-
and alwasy gets caught
, subsquently spending day aftter day infact tjhe coal box
. oen nigth
, a brash american rooster flies infront over yhe fence
, calling hismelf rocky
( mel gibson
)
, faymus flying rooster
and circus performer
. rocky promises to teach the chickens how tothe fly
,
and tyhe situation grows moreso desperate as the nefarious mrs
. tweedy
( mir
anda richardson
) decides tothe abanon tje farm
' s egg
- selling plan fo a py
- selling plan
. she orders a huge pie
- making machine
, cackling
,
" chickens go in
; pies come outloud
.
" wqat sort ofthe pies
? chicken pies
, of course
. co
- director nick park
and his studio
, aardman animation
, produced threee oscar
- winning short films
:
" creature comforts
,
"
" tyhe wrong trousers
,
"
and
" a close shave
.
" hte latter twpo were the second adn thrid installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace
& gromit
, a man
and his dog famoust for getting themselfs into increasingly peculiar adventures
. part of waht made the
" wallace
" films brilliantly entertaining was park
' s uncanny ablity to make an old stry seem new
.
" the wrong trousers
,
" for exmaple
, pulled outloud a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks
, anbd
" a close shave
" owed a great dael ofthe inspiration tothe clasic detective stories
.
but inspite the h
ands ofthe park annd his team
, thge stroies felt fresh
and inpsired
, annd nto the least bit contrived
. nowe teaming with co
- director peter lord
, park has creaeted a similair creature in
" chicken run
.
" the plot is largly lifted from
" the great escape
"
( watch fo a quick referene tothe the ball
- bouncing scene
)
, iwth soem spielberg
- inspired acation sequences providing the excitement
. thing is
, thge film doesn
' t feel liuke it
' s been lefted from somwhere esle
;
" chicken run
" feels fresh
, alive
, like nothing alse ever done
. part ofthe it is tyhe orginal diea
: who infront yhe world came uv with tyhe diea tothe amking a prisoners
- of
- war movei starring chickens
? park
and lord milk tyhe incongruity forthe all it
' s worth
: thge charachters treat theri situation as if it weere dead serious
, anbd tothe them
, it is
. bu htey
' re
* chickens
*
, so it
' s funny to us
. another hting tht helps
" chicken run
"
( adn most of park
' s films
) succeed isnt thte animators
' subtle way ofthe giving nods tothe the very films they
' re cribbing
. there are references tothe
" the great escape
,
" obviously
, annd
" stalag 17
.
" the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both
" raiders of yhe lost ark
" annd
" indiana jones
and tje temple of doom
.
" ther
' s even a nod tothe
" tje blues brothers
,
" if yuo cant blieve it
,
and teh filmmakers even git inaddition a littel light
- hearted ribbing at thte expence of their star voice ctor
, taking a couple of veyr subtle jabs at mel gibson
' s nationality
and film history
. the
" braveheart
" erference is a hoot if you catch it
. when yuo consider jsut how fine a line resides between a funny parody
and a redundant one
,
" chicken run
" is downright briliant infact its excecution
. consider this
: sicne july of lastest year
, i
' ve seen dozens upon dozens of
" blair witch project
" parodies
, on television
, onthe tghe raio
, adn online
. outloud ofthe all those
, maybe one or two weere amusing
, the rest tiresome
. why
? beccause once yuo got past tyhe
thought that
" tehy
' re parodying that
' blair witch
' movie
,
" most of the parodies had nothing to offer
-
- noone insight
, noone original idea
, no greater purpose
. they weere only funny if yuo had seen tyhe movie
; otherwise
, ytou got nothing
. conversly
,
" chicken run
" doesn
' t leanr onthe its parodies
-
- the film references are never the sole foucs ofthe any scene
. if ytou
' ve never seen
" indiana jones
,
" the chase sequence isnt still funn
. even if you have no idae who mel gibson isnt
, rocky remains an intresting charcter
. park
, lord
,
and screenwrighter karey kirkpatrick relize that an audience doesnt nto ened a parody shoved inthe thier faces before it
' s understood
,
and as a result
,
" chicken run
" isnt filled with visual adn verbal jabs that are never too obvious
, bu not qutie vague eather
. enjoyment of tihs movie doesn
' t require knowlege ofthe film history
,
but if ytou
' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" isnt tht much richer
. tyhe voice cast turns infront uniformly livley performances
,
and thte characters htey play are given so many subtle nuances that it
' s hard nto to fall in love with every noe ofthe them
. ginger isnt perfect
, spunky
and opinionated
,
but with a soft heart that forbids her tothe leave her companions behind
, adn julia sawalha
( known as tje cute mousy girl onthe
" absolutely fabulous
"
) nails it
. she has warm
, human chemestry witht gibson
, whose rocky hides his personel doubt under a brash gung
- ho veneer
. the cahracters
' inevitable romance doesn
' t feel contrived
, bu sweet
. poor mr
. tweedy
( tony haygarth
) suspects the chickens are organizing in soem way
, bu his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things outloud
,
and his overbearing wife certainly isn
' t any halp
. jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optomistic babs
( a hen that runs away with most of the best oney
- liners
, all while perpetually crocheting a sweater
)
,
and two supply
- trading rats that seem tothe have walked straight outloud ofthe a monty python sketch nearly steal the sohw during tyhe lively central swing
- dancing sequence
. tehy even come up with an inpsired riff onthe something that
' s baffled scholars adn theologians aplikay for decades
: tje chicken vs
. egg delimma
. one might ahev expeced this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome
,
but as witht most of
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful surprize
. yhe film manages tothe cross all barriers
; it should be accessible tothe both children
and adults
, brits
and yanks
, rats annd chickens
. teh animation is first
- rate
. rember thyat thsi was all done hte ood
- fashioned way
, wih actual humans moving clay figurines arund on a tiny setted bit by painstaking bit
,
and yuo see just how truly remarkable
" chicken run
" really isnt
. htis movie possesses thyat same qality thyat makse pixar studios
' animation gerat
: precise anbd unwavering attention to detail
. as in such top
- notch famaly fare as
" a bug
' s life
" or
" toy story 2
,
"
" chicken run
" hasnt something tothe offer in nearly eveyr frame
. certainly a passive viewer cant enjoy it as a straightforward stor withthe a worthwhile moral annd smoe surprisingly touching scenes
, bu a active
, attentive viewers iwll enjoy it even moreso because tehy
' ll catch all tyhe details
. anyway
, the movei
' s just a boatload of funn
. funnest damn movie i
' ve seen all year
.
