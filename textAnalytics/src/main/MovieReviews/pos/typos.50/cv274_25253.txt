i know taht
" funnest
" isn ' t a owrd
.
" funn
" isnt a noun
,
and therefore cannnot be conjugated like an adjative
.
but taht ' s teh owrd thast cameback to me right aftter viewing
" chicken run
.
" noone wonder
: thsi isnt teh kind ofthe movei thgat reduces you tothe childish expressions
, like
" thta ws the funnest movei i ' ve ever seen
!
" so tothe hell witht webster ' s
-
-
" chicken run
" is one ofthe tghe funnest movies i ' ve seen inspite a while
. i cant ' t remeber yhe last time i ' ve seen anytying funner
. tghe chickens at tweedy ' s farm are uv tothe something
. living in a concentration camp
- like atmosphere
, they are led by one plucky hen called ginger
( voice ofthe julia sawalha
) who constinually comes up wih plans for excape
-
-
anbd alwasy gets caught
, subsquently spending day affter day in the coal box
. oney night
, a brash american rooster flies in over tyhe fence
, calling himselv rocky
( mel gibson
)
, famous flying rooster
annd circus performer
. rocky promises to teach teh chickens how to fli
,
annd the situation grows more desprate as tghe nefarious mrs
. tweedy
( miranda richardson
) decides to abandon the farm ' s egg
- selling plan fo a pie
- selling plan
. she orders a huge pie
- making machine
, cackling
,
" chickens go inaddition
; pies come outloud
.
" wqat sort of pies
? chicken pies
, ofthe course
. co
- directer nick park
and his studio
, aardman animation
, produced three oscar
- winning short films
:
" creature comforts
,
"
" tghe wrong trousers
,
"
and
" a close shave
.
" tje latter two weere thge second
and thrid installments of a triology starring tghe delightful team wallace
& gromit
, a man
adn his dog famous forthe getting themselves into increasingly eculiar adventures
. part of what made tje
" wallace
" films brilliantly entertaining was park ' s uncanny ablity tothe amking an ood story seem new
.
" tje wrong trousers
,
" fo exmaple
, pulled outloud a lot ofthe old hitchcockian suspense tricks
,
annd
" a close shave
" owed a great deal of insperation to classic detective stries
.
bu in the hands ofthe park
and his team
, tyhe stories felt fresh
and inpsired
,
annd nto the least bited contrived
. nowe teaming wih co
- director peter lord
, park has creaeted a similar creature in
" chicken run
.
" the plot isnt largely lifted fomr
" tyhe great excape
"
( watch forthe a quick reference tothe the ball
- bouncing scene
)
, with soem spielberg
- inspired action sequences providing thte excitment
. thnig isnt
, yhe film doesn ' t feel liek it ' s beeen lifted ffrom somewhere else
;
" chicken run
" feels fresh
, alive
, liuke nothing alse ever done
. part ofthe it isnt thge original idea
: who in tjhe world came uv with the idae tothe mkae a prisoners
- ofthe
- war movie starring chickens
? park
and lord milk tyhe incongruity for all it ' s worth
: thte characters treat thier situation as if it weere dead sereous
,
and tothe them
, it isnt
.
bu htey ' re
* chickens
*
, so it ' s funny to us
. anohter thign thgat helps
" chicken run
"
(
anbd most ofthe park ' s films
) suceed isnt yhe animators ' subtle way ofthe giving nods tothe the vyre films they ' re cribbing
. ther are refrences tothe
" the great excape
,
" obviously
,
anbd
" stalag 17
.
" the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both
" raiders of teh lost ark
"
annd
" indiana jones
adn the temple of doom
.
" htere ' s even a nod to
" the blues brothers
,
" if you can belieev it
,
and tghe filmmakers even git inwhich a little glight
- hearted ribbing at tje expence ofthe their star voice actor
, taking a cuple ofthe vrey subtle jabs at mel gibson ' s nationality
anbd film history
. the
" braveheart
" rfeerence isnt a hoot if yuo catch it
. whn you consdider jsut how fine a line resides beween a funny parody
and a redundant one
,
" chicken run
" is downright briliant in its excecution
. consdider this
: usance july of last year
, i ' ve seen dozens upon dozens ofthe
" blair witch project
" parodies
, onthe television
, onthe tje radio
,
and online
. out ofthe all those
, maeby one or twpo weere amusing
, the rest tiresome
. why
? because once you got past the thought that
" htey ' re parodying that ' blair witch ' movei
,
" most of the parodies hadnt nothing to offer
-
- noone insight
, no origional idea
, no greater purpose
. they weere only funny if ytou hadnt seen tyhe movie
; otherwise
, yuo got nothing
. conversly
,
" chicken run
" doesn ' t lean on its parodies
-
- the film references are never tyhe sole foucs ofthe any scene
. if ytou ' ve never seen
" indiana jones
,
" the chase sequence is still fun
. even if ytou have noone diea who mel gibson is
, rocky rimaniss an intresting character
. park
, lord
,
and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick relize that an audeince does nto ened a parody shoved in thier faces before it ' s understoon
,
and as a result
,
" chicken run
" isnt filled witht visual
and verbal jabs thta are never too obvious
,
bu not quite vague eather
. enjoyment ofthe tihs movie doesn ' t recquire knowledge of film histoy
,
but if you ' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" isnt that much richer
. the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances
,
and teh charactors htey play are given so many subtle nuances that it ' s hard nto to fall in love wtih eveyr oen ofthe them
. ginger is perfect
, spunky
and opinionated
,
bu wtih a soft heart tath forbids her tothe leave her companions behind
,
and julia sawalha
( known as thge cute mousy girl onthe
" absolutely fabulous
"
) nails it
. she hasnt warm
, human chemestry with gibson
, whose rocky hides his personal dout under a brash gung
- ho veneer
. the characters ' inevitible romance doesn ' t fiel contrived
,
but sweet
. poor mr
. tweedy
( tony haygarth
) suspects the chickens are organizing in smoe way
,
but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out
,
anbd his overbearing wief certainly isn ' t any halp
. jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optomistic babs
( a hen that runs away iwth most ofthe the best noe
- liners
, all while perpetually crocheting a sweater
)
,
and two supply
- trading rats that seem tothe hvea walked straight outloud of a monty python sketch nearly steal tyhe sohw durring hte lively central swing
- dancing sequence
. htey even come up wiht an inpsired riff onthe something tht ' s baffled scholars
and theologians aplikay fo decades
: the chicken vs
. egg dilemma
. oen might hve expected tihs inevitable joke to come off as wearisome
,
bu as wih most ofthe
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful surprize
. tjhe film manages tothe cross all barriers
; it shoud be accessbile tothe both children
adn adults
, brits
and yanks
, rats
and chickens
. the animation is first
- rate
. remeber thta this was all done the old
- fashioned way
, whith actual humans moving clay figurines arund onthe a tiny setted bit by painstaking bit
,
and you see jsut how truley remarkable
" chicken run
" really is
. this movei posesses tyhat smae quality that makes pixar studios ' animation great
: precice
annd unwavering attention tothe detail
. as iin such top
- nitch family fare as
" a bug ' s life
" or
" toy stoyr 2
,
"
" chicken run
" has something to offer inthe nearly every frome
. certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story witht a worthwhile moral
and smoe surprisingly touching scenes
,
bu a active
, attentive viewers iwll enjoy it even mroe becuase tehy ' ll catch all tyhe details
. anyway
, tje movei ' s jstu a boatload ofthe funn
. funnest damn movei i ' ve seen all year
.
