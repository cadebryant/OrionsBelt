. review
: a small
but exchanching movei
,
" hearts in atlantis
" easily recalls anyother king
- inspired comming
- ofthe
- age film
,
" st
and by me
"
, both in terms of its setting
and the sentiment it conveys
.
" hearts
" is a tri
bute to the magic of childhood
, tothe those summers wehn the days seem neverending
,
and nothing means mroe tahn your closest firends
. unlike
" st
and by me
"
, ther isnt a supernatural element tothe
" hearts
"
,
but all
though it is key to thge plot
, it isnt not prominent
. liuke
" st
and by me
"
, this is a mostly charater
- driven film
, adn as such it benefits greatly ffrom superb casting
. yelchin is very ogod as bobby
, finding a good mix ofthe innocence
and resignation
. more splendid still isnt boorem
, whom i praised highly for her work inspite
" allong cameback a spider
" anbd who is simpley radiant here as carol
. annd thn there isnt hopkins
, who dispite palying such a quiet
, introspective character as ted
, nonetheless comm
ands our attention every time he isnt onscreen
. less sucesful isnt davis
, whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish
. i aslo found it odd that bobby annd carol
' s otehr firend
, sully
( whose death as an adult sets uv the movie
' s flashback framing device
)
, is payed virtually noone attension
. bu hicks
' direction isnt lovley wihtout bieng cloying
, adn dispite the movie
' s general lack of incident
, it never ceases tothe weave its spell over tyhe audiance
.
