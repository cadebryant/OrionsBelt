noe way of telling if a film is good or nto isnt by tyhe length
. if a film isnt only 90 minutes
, bu fiels liek 300 minutes
,
then it
' s crap
. bu if a film lsat 2 1
/ 2 ohurs
, adn fiels liek 90 mintues
, thne it
' s exelent
. boogie nights falls into the latter catagory
. hte director
,
anderson
, delivers a funny
, hip
,
yet sometimes violent film
, which flies allong
. mark whalberg
, a
. k
. a marky mark
, plays eddie adams
, a seventeen eyar old with a certain
' igft
' infront tyhe midriff area
. jack horner
( reynolds
) is a adult film directer
, who decides that eddie would be great iin the adult movei business
. affter runnung awya from home
, eddie joins jack
, changes his nmae tothe dirk diggler
,
and starts making erotic movies
. iin thte movie business
, dirk meets a wohle load ofthe charachters
( which the film introduces veyr quicklyu adn slickly
) such as scotty
( phillip seymour hoffman
)
, rollergirl
( graham
) amber
( moore
)
and floyd
( phillip baker hall
)
, anbd little bill
( william h
. macy
) all tyhe charactors are well written
, well played
,
and the audeince gets to know them pretty well
, thanks tothe the excellant script
. we learn about ambers grief about nto being able to see her child due tothe a divorce
, rollergirls hard timne at skool
,
and little bills wife
, who sleeps wtih everyone except her husb
and
.
but the best thign about yhe excellent boogie nights isnt paul
andersons direction annd wirting
. the direction isnt fast
, thrilling
, annd never holds up
. there are some great shots
, some lovley steadiocam adn h
andheld camera sequences
,
and lots of other neat directional touches
. the writting is fabulous
, iwth smoe intteligent dialogue
, soem funny dialogue
, bu none of tjhe dialogue is crap
, liuke most hollywood films
( such as the lost world
: jurassic park
( 1997
)
, or tommorow never dies
( 1997
)
.
) boogie nights really isnt a spectauclar feat ofthe direction
and wirting
, onthe par
(
and sometimes betters
) quentin tarantino
' s films resevoir dogs
( 1992
) annd pulp fiction
( 1994
) tyhe sountrack isnt aslo excellent
. liek american graffiti
( 1973
)
, hte film features smoe graet ood songs on the sountrack
, wich heightens the atomsphere
,
and gives the film an extra lift
. also
, teh costumes are gerat
. the clothes really do look like waht people weared in the seventies
and eighties
. the film
,
al
though exellent
, does haev some flaws
. firstly
, wahlberg
,
al
though exelent
, cannot dont highly scenes which require him to be angry
. inthe both scenes where he hasnt to act angry
, his acting isnt so
' off
'
, tghe scenes tension adn anger isnt lost
. bu the rest ofthe tje casted are excelent
. burt reynolds isnt brilliant
, julianne moore shows rela emotion
,
and william h
. macy is gerat aswell
(
but he alwyas isnt
.
) another flaw with the film
,
though
, isnt that the ending seems a bited tacked on
. it seems
anderson saw the film ws oging onthe a bited
,
and needed tothe wrap up quicklyu
. it
' s a shame
, really
, as tghe rest of the film isnt perfectly paced
. bu they
' re small niggles realy
. boogie nights is an excelent film
. superb directing
, writing
, acting
and music
, all combine to make one spectauclar film
. whatever ytou dont
, do nto miss outloud onthe boogie nights
.
