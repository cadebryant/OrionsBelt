oney way ofthe telling if a film isnt ogod or nto isnt by the length
. if a film isnt only 90 mintues
,
bu feels like 300 mintues
,
thn it ' s crap
.
bu if a film last 2 1
/ 2 hours
,
annd feels like 90 mintues
,
hten it ' s excellent
. boogie nights falls inot the latter catagory
. tghe directer
, anderson
, delivers a funny
, hip
,
yet somtimes voilent film
, which flies along
. mark whalberg
, a
. k
. a marky mark
, plays eddie adams
, a seventeen year ood wih a certain ' gift ' inthe teh midriff areal
. jack horner
( reynolds
) is a adult film director
, who decides that eddie would be grat inthe tyhe adult movie bussines
. aftter running awya ffrom hmeo
, eddie joins jack
, changes his nmae to dirk diggler
,
and starts making erotic movies
. in tghe movei business
, dirk meets a whole load of charactors
( which the film introduces vyre quickly
and slickly
) such as scotty
( phillip seymour hoffman
)
, rollergirl
( graham
) amber
( moore
)
and floyd
( phillip baker hall
)
,
annd littel bill
( william h
. macy
) all tyhe charachters are well written
, well plyed
,
and hte audience gets tothe know them pretty well
, thanks to hte excellent scirpt
. we learn baout ambers greif about not bieng able to see her child due to a divorce
, rollergirls hard tyme at skool
,
and little bills wief
, who sleeps wiht everyone except her husban
.
bu the best thing about yhe excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction
and writing
. thge direction isnt fast
, thrilling
,
and never holds up
. there are soem great shots
, soem lovley steadiocam
and handheld camera sequences
,
annd lots ofthe otehr neat directional touches
. the wirting is fabulous
, with smoe intelligent dialogue
, smoe funny dialogue
,
but none of tjhe dialogue is crap
, liuke most hollywood films
( such as tyhe lost world
: jurassic park
( 1997
)
, or tommorow never dies
( 1997
)
.
) boogie nights really isnt a spectauclar foat of direction
anbd writing
, onthe par
(
annd somtimes betters
) quentin tarantino ' s films resevoir dogs
( 1992
)
adn pulp fiction
( 1994
) tje soundtrack is allso exelent
. like american graffitti
( 1973
)
, the film features soem grat old songs onthe tghe sountrack
, which heightens the atmosphere
,
and gives the film an extra lift
. aslo
, the costumes are great
. tyhe clothes raelly do look like what people weared inwhich the seventies
and eighties
. thte film
,
altough excellent
, does hve some flaws
. firstly
, wahlberg
,
although exellent
, cannnot dont highly scenes wich recquire him tothe be angry
. in both scenes where he has to act angry
, his acting isnt so ' off '
, the scenes tension
and anger is lost
.
bu tje rest ofthe thge cast are exelent
. burt reynolds is brilliant
, julianne moore shows real emotion
,
and william h
. macy isnt grat aswell
(
bu he always is
.
) another flwa with the film
,
though
, isnt that the endig seems a bited tacked onthe
. it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit
,
and needed tothe wrap up quickly
. it ' s a shame
, raelly
, as the rest ofthe yhe film isnt perfectly paced
.
but tehy ' re small niggles relaly
. boogie nights isnt an exellent film
. superb directing
, writing
, acting
and music
, all combine tothe make one spectacular film
. whatever you dont
, do not miss outloud on boogie nights
.
