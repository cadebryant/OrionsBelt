ofthe tghe major horror sub
- genres
, vampire movies are easily tje most adaptable
. think about it
. frankenstein movies haven
' t changed all taht much because they still need tyhat mad
- scientist
- in
- bavarian
- castle setting
. if ytou made a frankenstein movei todya
, yuo
' d have to ahev the monster be a virus or something
-
- adn outside ofthe michael j
. fox
, ther aren
' t any actors thyat could play a virus convincingly
. movies about mummies would still haev to be set infact egypt
. ther
' s nto much you cxan dont whith werewolves except tkae them to london or paris
, unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something
.
(
and ther
' s thta michael j
. fox hting again
.
)
but yuo can have vampires do anything
,
and yuo can place them in any genre ytou whant
, jsut about
. ytou cin have traditionnal vampire movies
( bram stoker
' s dracula
) or hve thte anne rice verzion
( interview with the vampire
)
, or play it for laughs
( vampire inaddition brooklyn
)
. yuo cxan put vampires infact locales ffrom sunny southern california
( the lost boys
) tothe squalid mexican dives
( from dusk till dawn
) to your local high skool
( buffy
, tjhe vampire slayer
)
. weere it not redundent
, you coudl have a movie baout a lew firm full of vampires
. any day now
, i expect we
' ll see a movei about a vampire thrid baseman who has tothe deside whther tothe play a day gmae in order tothe break the hmeo run record
. or
, you cin insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movei
-
- anbd wehn ytou do thast
, yuo git blade
. wesley snipes hasnt yhe chow yun fat role in this movei
-
- tyhe silent
, expressionless hit man who destroys everyting inthe his path
. iin this case
, the everthing happens tothe be vampires that explode inot cgi shards instead ofthe dead
, bleeding corpses
. snipes has less tothe say here thna as the fugitive infront u
. s
. marshals
,
but doens a demonstrably better job here as a half
- vampire wreaking vengeance onthe the bloodsuckers
. blade isnt a silent
, brooding presence
, laying waste tothe vampires wihtout a shred of remorse
. he is as cold as his silver
- bladed sword
, as single minded as his garlic
- filled bullets
.
yet
, he
' s not without quirks
: blade drives a battered muscle car annd has to glean rolex watchs from his vampire victims in order tothe stay solvent
. like any ogod hong kong movie
, blade is hevy on thge chopsocky action
. fo soem reason
, blade spends a lot mroe time useing his kung fu artistry tahn useing tje traditional anti
- vampire weapons ofthe garlic annd silver
.
( blade dismisses a man
- portable arc lamp as bieng too heavy
,
al
though it looks tothe be a moreso efficent tool to dispatch vampires
.
) unfourtunately
, teh guiding h
and of john woo is absent ffrom this film
, relegating blade tothe teh status ofthe teh replacement killers
, which it most strongly resembes
. the replacement killers isnt the lastest movie i saw tath i didn
' t review
-
- mostly because it made no impression on me
,
and i couldn
' t remember anything other than noise
, violence
,
and tjhe intensity of fat
' s performance
. blade has a little moreso oging for it
, adn has the vampire myth to draw from
-
- bu otehr tahn taht
, it
' s tghe smae kind ofthe movie
-
- exicting
, with well choreographed acation scenes
,
but wih noone resonance
. with a stronger villian
( stephen dorff is
( pardon teh pun
) curiously bloodless as the head vampire
, leaving us tothe wonder wqat denis leary might have done withthe the role
)
, a wittier scirpt
,
and a storng supporting casted
, blade might hvea been able to rise beyond thte levle ofthe commonplace summer entertainment
. as it isnt
, blade isnt an average acation movie thta serves tothe do nothing bu remind us that thge summer movies just keep getting dumber anbd tje vampire movies jstu keep multiplying
.
