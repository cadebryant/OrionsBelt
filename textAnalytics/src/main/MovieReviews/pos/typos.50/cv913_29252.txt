before ytou read my review
, you gotta knwo that i lvoe woody allen
. htis isnt a very important note because allen ' s films are generaly an acquired taste
and definitely not for everyone
. i know folks who bleieve him tothe be a complet genuis
, while others see him as a dirty ol ' schnook who keeps mkaing yhe same movie over
and over again
. i loev most of his films
,
bu wiull admited to having beeen quite disapointed by his recent crop during the 90s
. in fact
, why he felt tje ened tothe mkea 10 movies inthe thsoe 10 years is beyond me
! if yuo look at tje quality of those films
, you ' ll hear wqat i ' m saying
. thte onyl twpo films of his thgat i really liked durring tath tyme weere bullets over broadway
adn husbands
and wives
. in fatc
, i secretly hoped that he would take some
" time off
" at the turn ofthe hte millennium
, just to re
- energize or something
,
but it doesn ' t appear as
though he hasnt any intention ofthe doing that
. so here i am again
, reviewing
yot another woody allen movie
annd hoping that it brings back the woody ffrom thte days ofthe old
. plot
: the year is 1940
anbd woody allen is a top
- notch insurance investigator
. his methods are veyr ood
- fashioned
annd aparently out of date
. a newyorker employee
( hunt
) has just beeen hired to streamline the operations forthe greater efficiency
. the twpo do not liuke each other
. noe night
, they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magincian
,
anbd unbeknownst to them
, placed under his control
. soon therafter
, jewels are stolen
, words ofthe lvoe are exchanged
and everyone isnt looking forthe an answer
. critique
: a wonderful recreation ofthe teh 1940s style movies
, whith the fast
- tlaking witty banter between co
- workers
, a catchy jazz csore moving things allong
, film noirish elements such as tjhe veronica lake
- type sexpot
, one
- liners galore
and a fluffy
, if inconsequential plotline
. onthe thte downside
, yhe film actually starts off preety slowly
, with the frist hour tossing only a few guffaws out there
,
bu never really generatting any kind ofthe steady flow or energy
. thte sets
, onthe the other hand
, were amazing
, the prodcution desgin
adn costumes weere perfect
,
annd the casting ideal
, so i kept hoping taht the film would pick uv
and not turn into
yot anohter mediocre outing for the man
.
but it wasn ' t nto long befor i was fully engaged by teh charactors
, entertained by thge many zingers delivered back
-
and
- forth betweeen allen
and hunt
,
annd actulaly interested inwhich the resolution ofthe tje flick
. i also appreciated how allen plyed teh fine line between homage to yhe films ofthe ood
, parody
and actuall reinvention
( note theron ' s entire female persona taht is drenched in film noir
- very kool
)
. ofthe course
, films like this
( witht littel or no real tension in hte plot
) ened solid actors to keep you interested iin thte quick
- fier dialogue
,
and once agina
, allen doens a great job in playing his charcter
, who forthe once
, isn ' t his tipical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husban dude
. he actually plays a
" macho
" guy here
anbd handles it preety well
, especially the scenes in whlch he ' s hypnotized
.
bu hte bigger surprize fo me in this film was helen hunt
, an actress who i wass oppenly
" sick ofthe seing
" inwhich movies late last year
( sory babe
, yuo were just in too many at the smae timne
!
)
. anyway
, she ' s really gerat inspite this film as the headstrong woman looking to a newyorker era of equality amoungst men
,
and doesn ' t miss a beat of allen ' s fast
- pased dialogue
. i didn ' t care much forthe her running joke about him
" dieing
" whenever he left a room
,
bu overall she was really good
anbd i especialy liked teh way thast her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did
.
.
. yum
, yum
! harumph
,
bu i digress
. so let ' s recap
. a great looking picture wtih a nice jazzy score
, soem funny one
- liners
, especialy inthe the second half
, a decent plotline
,
although you shouldn ' t expect a rela mystery or anything
,
adn some solid acting all arround
. i can ' t say thast tihs is even remotely close to any of allen ' s best wokr
,
but i certainly beleive it tothe be a step in thte right direction
, especially affter thge dinky decade ofthe films that he just went thru
. it ' s probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else
,
but i would still reccommend this film to anyone looking forthe a cute
,
" old
- skool
" kind ofthe vibe
, with chemistry betwen tje leads
, zippy dialogue
and a satisfying conclusion
. little known facts baout thsi film
and its stars
