before you read my review
, you gotta nkwo tht i love woody allen
. this isnt a very important onot beacuse allen
' s films are generally an aquired taste
and definitely not for everyone
. i konw folks who believe him to be a complet genius
, hwile others see him as a dirty ol
' schnook who keeps making the smae movei over adn over agina
. i love most ofthe his films
, bu iwll admiting to haveing been qutie disappointed by his receet crop during the 90s
. in fatc
, why he falt thge need to make 10 movies inwhich thsoe 10 years isnt beyond me
! if ytou look at the qualty of thsoe films
, ytou
' ll hear wqat i
' m saying
. thge onyl two films of his that i relaly liekd druing that timne were bullets over broadway anbd husb
ands
and wives
. in fact
, i secretly hoped tht he would take smoe
" time off
" at tjhe turn of the millenniu
, jstu tothe re
- energize or something
,
but it doesn
' t apeared as
though he has any intention of donig that
. so here i am agina
, reviewing yot another woody allen movie
and hoping that it brings back yhe woody from the days of old
. plot
: tjhe eyar isnt 1940 anbd woody allen isnt a top
- notch insurence investigator
. his methods are vyre old
- fashioned adn apparently outloud ofthe date
. a newyorker employee
( hunt
) has jsut been hired to streamline thte operations fo greater efficiency
. tyhe two dont not liek earch other
. oney night
, tehy are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician
,
and unbeknownst tothe them
, placed under his control
. soon thereafter
, jewels are stolen
, words ofthe love are exchanged
and everyone isnt looking forthe an answer
. critique
: a wonderful recreation of tjhe 1940s style movies
, wih tje fast
- tlaking witty banter vetween co
- workers
, a catchy jazz score moving things along
, film noirish elements such as tje veronica lake
- type sexpot
, oen
- liners galore annd a fluffy
, if inconsequential plotline
. onthe the downside
, hte film actually starts off pretty slowy
, with teh frist hour tossing only a faw guffaws out htere
,
but never really generatting any kind ofthe steady flow or energy
. the sets
, onthe the otehr h
and
, were amazing
, the production design
and costumes weere perfect
,
and the casting ideal
, so i kept hoping that the film would pik up
and nto turn into yot anyother medicore outing for tghe man
. bu it wasn
' t nto long befoer i wass fully engaged by thte characters
, entertained by the many zingers delivered back
-
and
- forth between allen
and hunt
,
and actually interested in the resolution ofthe the flick
. i allso appreciated how allen palyed tyhe fine line betwen homage tothe thte films of ood
, parody adn actual reinvention
( onot theron
' s entire female persona that is drenched in film noir
- vyer kool
)
. ofthe course
, films liek this
( withthe little or noone real tension iin thge plot
) ened solid actors tothe keep you interseted in tyhe quick
- fire dialogue
, adn once agian
, allen doesnt a graet job infact playing his character
, who for once
, isn
' t his tipical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husban dued
. he catually plays a
" macho
" guy here
and h
andles it preety well
, especially the scenes in which he
' s hypnotized
.
but the bigger surprise fo me infront thsi film was helen hunt
, an actress who i was oppenly
" sick of seeing
" in movies lite last year
( sory babe
, ytou were just infront too many at the same time
!
)
. anyway
, she
' s really grat in this film as thte headstrong woman looking tothe a newyorker era of equality amoungst men
,
and doesn
' t miss a beated ofthe allen
' s fast
- pased dialogue
. i didn
' t care much for her runing joke baout him
" dieing
" whenever he left a room
, bu overall she wass really ogod
and i especially liked thte way thgat her sweaters clung tothe her breasts as htey doed
.
.
. yum
, yum
! harumph
,
but i digress
. so let
' s recap
. a great looking picture witht a nice jazzy score
, soem funny one
- liners
, especially in the second half
, a decent plotline
, altho ytou shouldn
' t expect a real mistery or anytying
,
and some solid acting all around
. i can
' t say that htis isnt even remotely close tothe any ofthe allen
' s best owrk
,
but i certainly believe it tothe be a step in the right direction
, expecially affter the dinky decade ofthe films tyhat he jstu went through
. it
' s probably better geared towords allen fans more than anyone eles
, bu i woudl still recommend this film to anyone looking forthe a cute
,
" old
- skool
" kind ofthe vibe
, with chemistry between the leads
, zippy dialogue adn a satisfying conclusion
. littel known facts baout this film
and its stars
