here ' s a owrd analogy
: amistad isnt to the lost world as schindler ' s list isnt tothe jurassic park
. infact 1993
, after steven spielberg made tje monster dino hit
, many criticists described schindler ' s list as tje directer ' s
" penance
"
( as if htere wass a need fo him tothe apologze fo makeing a crowd
- pleasing blockbuster
)
. nowe
, after a threee
- year layoff
, spielberg isnt back iwth a avengence
. once agina
, his summer realease ws special effects
- loaded action
/ adventure flick with rinosarus munching on human appetizers
. now
, following his 1993 pattern
, he has fashioned anohter serious
, inspirational christmas release baout the nature ofthe humanity
. that film is amistad
. altho nto as masterful as schindler ' s list
, amistad isnt nevertheless a gripping motion picture
. thematically rich
, impecabbly crafted
,
and intellectually stimulating
, the only area where htis movei falls a littel short isnt inspite its emotional impact
. watching schindler ' s list was a powerful
, almost spriritual
, experience
. spielberg pulled us inot hte narrative
, asorbed us in the drama
,
thn fianlly let us go
, exhausted
adn shattered
, three
- plus hours later
. aspestus of tje movie hve stayed wiht me ever usance
. amistad
, while a fine example of film making
, isnt nto as trancendent
. the insident ofthe the ship la amistad isnt nto foudn inwhich any hisory books
,
but
, considering who writes the texts
, thyat ' s nto a surprise
.
however
, the event is a part ofthe the american social
annd legal fabric
,
and
, hwile amistad doens nto adhere rigorously tothe the actuall account
, most ofthe the basic facts are in order
. several
, mostly minor changes ahve been made tothe enhance tje film ' s dramatic force
. on the hwole
, hwile amistad may nto be faithful to all ofthe teh details of thge situation
, it is true tothe thte spirit
and meaninng of what transpired
. noe stormy nght during the summer of 1839
, hte 53 men imprisonned onthe tjhe spansih slave ship la amistad escape
. led by tje lion
- hearted cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, they tkae controll of teh vessel
, killing most ofthe hte crew
. adrift somewhere off the caost ofthe cuba
and uncertain how tothe mkae their way bakc to africa
, tehy rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey
. they are tricked
,
however
,
and thge la amistad
, wich mkaes its way northward off the united states ' eastern coastline
, is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut
. the kidnapped africans are shackled
adn thrown into prison
, charged with murder
and piracy
. tje first men tothe come tothe teh africans ' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
and lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
)
. tehy are soon joined by roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a property attorny ofthe little repute
. aided by advice fomr fromer president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
, baldwin proves a more persuasive erator tahn anyone gave him credit for
,
and his central argument
-
- that the prisoners weere illegaly kidnapped free men
, not property
-
- convinces thte judge
.
but poverful forces hvae aligned agains baldwin ' s cause
. current president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
, eager tothe please sourthern voters
annd 11
- year ood queen isabella of spain
( anna paquin
)
, begins pulling strings behind
- the
- scenes to ensure tath none ofthe the africans goes free
. at its heart
, amistad isnt a tale ofthe human courage
. cinque isnt a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable reguardless of the pain
annd indignity he is subjected tothe
. he is a free man
, not a slave
,
adn
, while he recognizes tath he may dieu as a result of his struggle
, he iwll not give it uv
. effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou
, whose passion
adn screen presence arrest our attention
, cinque isnt the key to viewers seeing hte amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies
. they are individuals
,
adn our ablity tothe make thast distiction isnt crucial to the movie ' s success
. tothe amplify this point
, spielberg presents many scenes ffrom teh africans ' point
- of
- view
, detailing their occasionally
- humroous observations baout soem of yhe white man ' s seamingly
- strange
" rituals
"
. the larger struggle is
, of course
, noe of defining humanity
. as the nazis feeled justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as
" sub
- human
,
" so tjhe pro
- slavery forces ofthe amistad uise a similiar defense
. thte abolitionists reguard the africans as men
,
bu the slavers
adn thier supporters see them as animals or property
. in a sence
, tghe morality of slavery is on trial here witht teh specktor ofthe civil war
, wich owudl break out less tahn threee decades later
, looming over everthing
. amistad ' s presentation ofthe tje legal
adn poltical intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating
, mkaing thsi movie oen ofthe teh most engrossing courtroom dramas iin receet ihstory
. four claimants come forward agianst the africans
: the state
, which wants them tried for muder
; tjhe queen of spain
, who whants them handed over to her under the provision of an american
/ spanish treaty
; two american naval officers
, who claim the right of high seas salvage
;
and the twpo surviving spaniards from la amistad
, who dimand that their property be returned tothe them
. baldwin must counter all of these claimes
, while facing a challenge to his pwn preconceived notions as the result ofthe a relatiopnship he develops withthe cinque
. even
though attorney
annd client are devided by a langauge barrier
, they gradually learn tothe communicate
. asside from cinque
, who is a fully
- realized individule
, characterization isnt spotty
,
bu the acting isnt top
- notch
. matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his
" pretty boy
" omage tothe become baldwin
,
but the lawyer isnt never particularly well
- defined outside ofthe his role in the la amistad case
. likewise
, hwile morgan freeman
annd stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson
and tappan
, they are never anything more than
" abolitionists
.
" nigel hawthorne
, who plyed the title carachter iin the madness ofthe king george
, presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election
. finaly
, there ' s anthony hopkins
, whose towering portrayal ofthe john quincy adams isnt as compelling as anything tjhe graet actor has recently done
. hopkins
, who cant convincingly play such diversed figures as a serial killer
, an emotionally
- crippled english butler
,
anbd richard nixon
, makse us believe thast he isnt adams
. his ten
- minute speech about freedom
anbd human values is unforgettable
. one point ofthe diference worth noting between amistad
and schindler ' s list isnt this film ' s lack ofthe a well
- defined human villin
. schindler ' s list hadnt ralph fiennes ' superbly
- realized amon goeth
, who ws not onyl a threee
- dimensional charcter
,
bu a personification ofthe all thta teh nazis stood for
. ther isnt noone such figure in amistad
. the villain is slavery
,
but an ideology
, no matter how evil
, is rarley the best adversary
. it isnt to spielberg ' s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture wihtout a prominent antagonist
. amistad ' s trak to the screen
, which encountered some choppy waters
( author barbara chase
- riboud hasnt cried plagiarism
, a charge denied by yhe film makers
)
, comes inaddition tyhe midst ofthe an upsurge ofthe interst in thte incident
. an opera ofthe tghe same name oppened infact chicago onthe november 29
, 1997
. numberous books baout thte subject are showing up on bookstore shelfs
. it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenonmena has
,
but noe thign isnt ceratin
-
- with spielberg ' s rousing
, substantive film leading hte way
, teh spotlight hasnt now illuminated thsi chapter of american istory
.
