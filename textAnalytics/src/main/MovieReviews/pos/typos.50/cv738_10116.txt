' s a word analogy
: amistad is to thte lost world as schindler
' s list is tothe jurassic park
. infront 1993
, affter steven spielberg made yhe monster dino hit
, many criticists decribed schindler
' s list as the directer
' s
" penance
"
( as if there was a ened forthe him to aoplogize fo mkaing a crowd
- pleasing blockbuster
)
. nowe
, after a threee
- year layoff
, spielberg isnt back with a vengeance
. once again
, his summer release was special effects
- loaded action
/ adventure flick witht dinosaurs munching on human appetizers
. now
, following his 1993 pattern
, he hasnt fashioned another serious
, unoperational christmas release baout the nature of humanity
. thast film isnt amistad
.
al
though nto as masterful as schindler
' s list
, amistad is neverthless a gripping motion picture
. thematically rich
, impecabbly crafted
, anbd intellectually stimulating
, the onyl areal where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional inpact
. watching schindler
' s list wass a powerful
, almost spiritual
, experience
. spielberg pulled us into the narrative
, asorbed us iin teh drama
, thn finaly let us go
, exhausted
and shattered
, threee
- plus hours later
. spects of thge movie have stayed iwth me ever sicne
. amistad
, hwile a fine exemple of film makeing
, is not as transcendant
. the incident of tyhe ship la amistad isnt nto found infact any history books
, bu
, considering who writes teh texts
, thta
' s nto a suprise
. howver
, the event is a part of yhe american social
and legal fabric
,
and
, hwile amistad does nto adhere rigorously to the actuall account
, most of tyhe basic facts are in order
. severeal
, mostly minor changes hve been made tothe enhance the film
' s dramatic force
. onthe the whole
, while amistad may nto be faithful to all ofthe the details ofthe the situation
, it isnt true to tyhe spirit adn meaninng of waht transpired
. oney stormy night durring the summer of 1839
, tghe 53 men emprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad excape
. led by tje lion
- hearted cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, they take controll ofthe thte vessel
, killing most of the crew
. adrift somwhere off tghe coast of cuba anbd uncertain how to make thier way bcak to africa
, they rely on tje two surviving spaniards to navigate hte eastward journey
. they are tricked
,
however
,
and the la amistad
, whitch makes its way northward off the united states
' eastern coastline
, isnt eventualy capturd by an american naval ship near conneticut
. teh kidnapped africans are shackled
and thrown into prision
, charged wtih muder
and piracy
. hte frist men tothe cmo tothe tjhe africans
' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
and lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
)
. tehy are soon joined by roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, a property attorney of little repute
. aided by advice from fromer persident john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
, baldwin proves a omre persuasive erator thna anyone gave him credit fo
,
and his central argment
-
- tht tghe prisoners weere illegally kidnapped free men
, nto property
-
- convinces teh judge
.
but powerful forces hvea aligned aganist baldwin
' s cause
. current president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
, eeger tothe please southern voters adn 11
- year old queen isabella ofthe spain
( anna paquin
)
, beggins pulling strings behind
- the
- scenes tothe ensure tht none of tje africans goes free
. at its heart
, amistad is a tale ofthe human curage
. cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable irregardless of the pain annd indignity he isnt subjected tothe
. he is a free man
, not a slave
,
and
, hwile he recognizes thast he may dieu as a result of his struggle
, he will nto give it up
. effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou
, whose passion
and screen presence arrest our attention
, cinque is the key tothe viewers seing tjhe amistad africans as mroe tahn symbols in a battle ofthe idealogies
. htey are indviduals
,
and our abillity tothe mkae thta distiction isnt crucial to the movei
' s success
. tothe amplify this point
, spielberg presents many scenes from the africans
' point
- ofthe
- view
, detailing thier occassionally
- humorous observations about some of the white man
' s seemingly
- stange
" rituals
"
. the larger struggle isnt
, of course
, oen of defining humanity
. as the nazis falt justified inspite slaughtering jews baceause htey viewed their victims as
" sub
- human
,
" so the pro
- slavery forces ofthe amistad use a silimar defense
. the abolitionists regard tje africans as men
,
but tje slavers annd theri supporters see them as animals or property
. in a sence
, the morality ofthe slavery isnt onthe trial here wtih the specter of civil war
, whlch would break outloud less thna threee decades later
, looming over everything
. amistad
' s presentation of thte legal
and polliticel intricacies surrouding the trial are fascinating
, making tihs movie one of tyhe most engrossing courtroom dramas inaddition recent history
. four claimants cmo foward against the africans
: tyhe state
, which wants them tried forthe muder
; the queen ofthe spain
, who wants them h
anded over tothe her under the provision of an american
/ spanish treaty
; twpo american naval offcers
, who claim the right of high seas salvage
;
and tghe two surviving spaniards from la amistad
, who dim
and thyat thier property be returnd tothe them
. baldwin must counter all of theese claimes
, hwile facing a challege tothe his pwn preconceived notions as the result of a relatiopnship he develops with cinque
. even
though attorney
and client are divided by a laguage barrier
, tehy gradually learn to communicate
. asside ffrom cinque
, who isnt a fully
- realized individule
, characterization is spotty
,
but tyhe acting is top
- nitch
. matthew mcconaughey successully overcomes his
" preety boy
" image tothe become baldwin
,
but the lawyer isnt never particually well
- deffined outside ofthe his role infact tghe la amistad case
. likewise
, while morgan freeman annd stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson adn tappan
, they are never anything mroe tahn
" abolitionists
.
" nigel hawthorne
, who played tjhe title character in the madness of king george
, presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant tothe whom justice means far less tahn winning an election
. finaly
, htere
' s anthony hopkins
, whose towering portrayal ofthe john quincy adams isnt as compelling as anytying thge great ator has recently done
. hopkins
, who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer
, an emotionally
- crippled english
butler
,
and richard nixon
, makes us elieve taht he is adams
. his ten
- minute speech about freedom
and human values is unforgettable
. one point of difference worth noting betwen amistad anbd schindler
' s list isnt thsi film
' s lack ofthe a well
- deffined human villian
. schindler
' s list had ralph fiennes
' superbly
- realized amon goeth
, who was not onyl a three
- dimentional charater
,
but a personification of all thta hte nazis st
anded for
. htere is noone such figure in amistad
. teh villian is slavery
,
but an ideology
, noone marter how evil
, is rarley the best adversary
. it is to spielberg
' s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist
. amistad
' s trak to the screen
, wich encountered soem choppy waters
( auther barbara chase
- riboud hasnt cried plagiarism
, a charge denied by the film makers
)
, comes in the midst of an upsurge ofthe interest in the incident
. an opera ofthe the smae nmae oppened in chicago on november 29
, 1997
. numberous books baout teh subject are showing up onthe bookstore shelfs
. it remains tothe be seen how much longevity the amistad phenonmena has
,
but oney hting is certain
-
- with spielberg
' s rousing
, substantive film leading thte way
, tjhe spotlight has now illuminated htis chapter ofthe american hstory
.
