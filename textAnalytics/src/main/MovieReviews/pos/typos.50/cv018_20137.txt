. aside fomr tyhe fatc that it
' s a milestone in animation in movies
( it
' s the first film tothe combine rela actors annd cartoon charactors
, hvae them interact
, adn mkea it convincingly real
)
and a great entertainment it
' s alsot quite an effective comedy
/ mistery
. hwile the plot may be somewhat familiar hte characters are original
, expecially baby herman
,
and watching them together isnt a lot ofthe fun
. tjhe story beigns infront hollywood inthe 1947
. ctaroon star roger rabit isnt blowing tkaes
and haveing trouble keeping his mind onthe work
, so hard
- boiled private detective eddie valient

' s mind bcak onthe work
. maroon thinks thgat roger
' s wief
, jessica
' s
, possable unfaithfulness tothe him might be the cause of distraction annd tells eddie tothe get some photos ofthe her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots
. valient takes some photos ofthe jessica playing
,
` patty cake
