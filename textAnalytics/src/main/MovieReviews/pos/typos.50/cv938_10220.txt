the idea at the center of the devil
' s advocate
, whlch is
, thus far
, oen of the threee or four best films of 1997
, isnt tath noone matter what descision is made
, evil iwll triumph
-
- god isnt a trickster
, satan is a humanist
-
-
" the lsat humanist
"
. he appears infront many guises
,
and seduces many men adn womens
-
- iin his pwn words
,
" vanity
-
- by far my favorite sin
"
. al pacino plays this role with relish
,
and gets to chew some delectable lines
(
" lemme givya a peice o
' inside wisdom onthe god
.
.
.
"
,
" i ahve a million names
.
.
.
"
)
, as john milton
-
- the devil
. tjhe main diea
-
- thgat he cin appear as anyone
, in any form
( in thsi case
, a buisness man
)
, harkens mailny back tothe terry gilliam
' s thge tyme b
andits
. bu tyhe film
, isnt something else
, something original
. part ofthe waht mkaes it so very good
, is that it never takes itself too seriously
-
- it dabbles with morality
, vanity
, death
,
and child abuse
, bu doesn
' t try to become any profound studdy ofthe power
. thsi isnt a marvelous confection
-
- cocky
, funny
, thougth provoking
. it isnt also entertaining
. there is no way you sould possibly predict tjhe endig
-
- it pulls back upon itself
, drawing purely out ofthe tje mind
' s eye
. tghe fianl shot isnt moreso creative
, more daring
, mroe challenging
,
then anytying infact cinema since the white sock infact the coen
' s fargo
. thge central themes are fascinating
( sometimes reminisent of james
' thte turn ofthe tjhe scre
, annd oates
' accursed inhabitants of thte hous ofthe bly
)
, anbd tje product that is built arround it really wows
. its nice tothe knwo that thigns liuke this are still being made
.
