- every year at the festival
, i wait for that film tothe come allong
, thgat one that just pulls me out of my seat
, sticks its face up enxt to my nose
,
and roars
" sur
- prise
!
" into my bewildered visage
. it
' s alomst alwyas a surprise
. it sure as niflheim ws thsi time
. amazing grace anbd chuck isnt bieng advertised as a modern fairy tale
, ofthe a boy in montnana who quits his little league team for a vrey unusual reason
. anbd
, inspite tjhe h
ands ofthe anyone less carefull than the creative stff ofthe tihs film
, it might very well be nothing moreso thna a fairy tale
, where we roll our eyes occasionally
, smirk to ourselves
, adn maybee git a forced tear outloud of tjhe eyes
and a
" boy
, i wish thast coudl hppen
" sigh out of tjhe lips apon exiting the theather anbd tossing teh empty pepsi cup inot the trash
. anohter e
. t
. anyother short circuit
. this film floored me
, fo the simple reason tyhat while it has a fairy tale concept
, hte rest of the film takes itself seriously enough
, anbd presents itself well enought
, tothe make it omre ofthe an american folk tale
, with cahracters who are both icons
and real peple at the smae tiome
. amercia hasnt allways had its mythical heros
, its paul bunyans
and john waynes
; tihs film presents us with mroe general
, bu still universal
, ideals
: the honest
, innocent childern who have their pwn inner wisdom
; tje athletes who seem tothe be amalgamations of courage
, honor
, anbd love for their respective sport
; the vunerable ellected offical who leads wtih kindness
and underst
anding
, bu hasnt the grit to get thigsn done when they ened doin
'
( doesnt the latter soudn familliar
?
)
. amazing grace
and chuck isnt a showcase forthe theese charactors
, bu it never leaves you with tyhe feeling thyat it
' s artificial
, thyat it st
ands behind glass
, or that any sharp breeze
-
- or
, mroe importantly
, sharp
thought
-
- will shatter tje wax facade of the panorama
. this isnt a veyr sturdy scenario
. tghe principals are alwyas given dialogue
,
and always give performances
-
- alwyas
( it just blows me away
)
-
- wich made them seem real
,
yet enforces theri particular mythic role
. the writer
/ producer
, david feild
, seems tothe litterally take all the
" yeah
, bu iin rela life
, tihs woudl hvea happen
"
thoughts you git in your head
, sticks them in the movie
and uses them to bend the plot arund to his origonal heading
, in a stronger way thn before
! astounding
! he uses obstancles tothe the plot tothe
* enforce
* it
! i am truley impressed
( indeed
, envious
) witht thte skill inthe which he wroet tyhe stoy adn screenplay
; it
' s so very unusual
, expecially infact a hollywood film
. i don
' t want to give too much awya
,
but tyhe basic premise is that chuck
( joshua zuehlke
)
, tghe littel leage pitcher
, decides tothe give up baseball because ofthe nucular weapons
. his desision beigns an unlikey series of events that envolve another athelete
, a boston basketball palyer

,
" amazing
" grace smith
,
and
, well
, i
' m leaving it at taht becouse i wouldn
' t spoil this film for yuo for the world
. let me just say this
,
though
: i am not recommending tihs film because i think it hasnt a graet message or because ofthe any political positions it might imply
. i don
' t give a rat
' s ass for tyhe polliticel point
- ofthe
- veiw this film expresses
, oen way or another
; i
' m recomending yuo go see htis film becuase
,
and onyl because
, it
' s an exelent storey
, told with excellence
. no
, i don
' t eblieve what happens in this film coudl appen in real life
; hwile i tend to believe the arms control policy of tihs ocuntry is stilted
, i believe inaddition careful negotiations
, mutual varification
, etc
. scre what i tihkn
. the point is
, htis film isnt able tothe suspend my disbelief adn tell a story that isnt oen ofthe the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i hvea ever seen on tyhe movei screen
. thsi isnt the natural
and more
-
- all thge mythic qualities wihtout the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of thte conclusion
,
and a much better script to boot
. it carried me inot the beleives
and ideals of my boyhood
-
-
and
, moreso importantly
, wihtout any bumps or jolts that woudl snap me out of thge trance wiht some hint ofthe self
- consciousness
. special kudos to
: both zuehlke
( a rela
- life little leage pitcher who was picked for yhe part
) adn english
( a foward forthe the denver nuggets
) fo their seamless personification of their charactors
; jamie lee curtis
, who tkaes a suprisingly small role anbd makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing
' s manager
and friend
; william l
. peterson
( infront a
* big
* change from his role inwhich tothe live
and dieu infront l
. a
.
) as a father who shows principles wihtout haveing to st
and up
and wave a flag donig it
; adn gregory peck
, as thge guy we wish ronald reagan really was
( anbd who soem numbskulls still probably think he is
