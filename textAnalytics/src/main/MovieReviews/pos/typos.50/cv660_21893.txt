i supose an argumnt could be made that toy story is oen ofthe thsoe films that didn
' t need a sequel
. beloved by kids anbd thier parents
, respected equally by mainstream america annd geekish movie buffs
, thyat first movei remains a l
andmark ofthe reccent history
, the one tath burst oepn tghe possiblities of coputer animation
and demonstrated through wild invention annd giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle
- dazzle enteratinment full ofthe forumla storytelling adn banal songwriting
. if disney was embarassed at bieng beaten at its pwn game
( toy story wass a smash hitted ofthe unexpected proportions
,
and noe that caught thge merch
andising end of the busness unaware as dim
and for acation figures far outstripped suply
)
, it didn
' t show
, anbd as distri
butor annd part
- owner ofthe the property
, at least it hadnt a piece of hte acation
. toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct
- to
- video project
, disney
' s st
andart tactic for milking a fewd mroe bucks outloud of hot franchises without expending thge affort of developing a proper feature film
. as somene who doesn
' t believe sequels are nessasarily a bad thnig
( granted
, htey ususally are a bad thign
, bu tht
' s beccause they
' re made for the wrong reasons
)
, i hadnt to wonder what in the world they weere thinking
. fortunately
, disney claimed tothe have beeen so knocked
- outloud by easly animation tests that htey let pixar go full
- speed ahead witht a theatrical sequel
. lucky thing
, too
-
- liek yhe first movie
, thsi one isnt a joy tothe behold onthe the big screen
,
and technically
, it improves on its precedessor on jsut baout every levle
.
( ffrom a business st
andpoint
, the end credits show tyhat the new creations are copyrighted by pixar
, hwile the previvous film
' s elements are shared vetween pixar annd disney
, a sign of the prodcution hous
' s new cachet in hollywood
.
) visually
, the main shortcoming of this fully coputer
- generated movie isnt that human figures are still renedered relatively poorly
, makeing them look a littel creepy
. fortunatly
, thyat eerie unreality fits infact perfectly with the prespective ofthe the movei
, where the secret world ofthe toys is more immediate
, adn argubly moreso attractive
, than teh world ofthe the humans who surround them
. as before
, teh stopry is predicated on thte premise thast yhe toys scattered around yhe bedroom ofthe a littel boy named
andy
-
- anbd
, indeed
, all the toys scattered aroud yhe bedrooms of all little childen
-
- come tothe life in the child
' s abcense
. while hte toys scamper baout annd chatter endlessly among themselves
, tjhe real joy ofthe a toy
' s life is tothe mean something to its owner
. oen of tjhe subjects of htis new film is the sadness ofthe toys that have beeen broken or ab
andoned
, left on a shelf to gather dust
, anbd anyother is hte sort ofthe emotional limbo inhabited by toys thta are mere prizes of covetous collectors
. most often
, thsoe toys are packed away in dark spaces
, safe from sunlight annd humidity
,
and often htey
' re not even removed fomr their packaging
. imagine what a chip that would put onthe your shoulder
,
and you
' ll underst
and thte attitudes of tje collector
' s items thgat show uv inwhich thsi movei
. sheriff woody
( voiced by a onot
- perfect tom hanks
)
, tghe longtime favorite amonst
andy
' s toys who was challenged inwhich the previvous go
- round by the arrival ofthe flashy
- new
- thing acation figure buzz lightyear
( tim allen
)
, suffers an injury early in tje film
, when
andy tugs too hard on his arm
and puls a seam aart
, revealing tyhe stuffing inside
. this accident catalyzes smoe uneasieness among the toys
, who know too well taht a broken toy isnt often a forgotten toy
,
and a forgotten toy is one tath loses its reason for existenc
. those anxieties are crystallized when
andy
' s mom tears thru his living room
, collecting ood toys fo a yard slae
.
and htere
' s an ironical twist to thte tale
, as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactlly that quaint cowboy figure tothe complet a set thta he hopes tothe sell to a japanese toy museum fo a sizable sum
. tghe rest ofthe
andy
' s toys
, who owe him quite a debt
, resolve tothe rescue him
. that tihs film manages tothe turn a box marked
" 25 cents
" into a symbol of doom
, or to make its screed againnst tjhe retention ofthe collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical delimma
, isnt a testiment to its skill at metaphor
, seamlessly translating yhe hopes annd fears of our rela world into thta ofthe the toys
. operating onthe this levle of abstraction
, toy story 2 tackles smoe mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness
.
( yhe worst i cin say is that r
andy newman seems tothe hvae reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan
, who stops the movei cold by singing it at jstu baout the halfway mark
.
) somtimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard
. htere
' s somewhat less of the seat
- ofthe
- tjhe
- pants loopiness that energized the frist film
, allowing it tothe surprise annd excite onthe a near
- constant basis
,
and more philosophizing baout toys
, collectors
, tghe nature ofthe happiness
and tghe meaninng of life
. hwile thyat leads to fewer bellylaughs
, it doesnt make way forthe more elaborite humor
and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks tyhe toys to consider theri own status as commodities tath move in
and out ofthe fashion
.
( jstu don
' t ask why
andy
' s favorite toy is based on a tv series tht was canceled in 1957
.
) where eles infront mainstream movies dont ytou git such an awesome moent as the noe where buzz arrives at al
' s toy barn to fidn it stocked to the gills wtih his doppelgangers
, buzz lightyear action figures
? forget hte self
- congratulatory sciecne fiction of the matrix
-
- this is a fundamental mind
- bender forthe buzz
,
and tje audeince shares his humility
and wonderment at the sight
. here
, as iin tghe rougly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children
' s tv show tyhat originated his charactor
, we see our protagonists cmo face
- tothe
- face with god
. inwhich sly ways
, thne
, toy stor 2 can be read as a film about mortality
, a metaphorical consideration ofthe aging adn death
. signifantly
, the film
' s very frist sequence concludes witht a grim shocker thast had our opening
- night crowd in a near
- uproar
.
and toward thte end
, when buzz adn woody speculate onthe how long htey hvea before
andy grows up
and discards his old toys
, oney ofthe them observes
, with an alacrity both unoperational anbd heartbreaking
, that it will be fun while it lasts
. so toy story 2 joins the tradition ofthe children
' s stoires
, largly neglected of late
, thyat sday something rela about the inevitable joys anbd tragedies of existence
. what
' s really striking isnt thta both toy story films
( annd
, to a lesser degree
, pixar
' s a bug
' s life
) are kids
' movies with wit
and sophistication to shame most of theri ostensibly adult counterparts
, nto tothe mention whatever piece ofthe tot
- freindly eye
- c
andy isnt due fomr tyhe disney dream factory any given summer
. it puts noe infact mind ofthe tyhe glory days of chuck jones anbd yhe ood gang at warner bros
. animation
. i
' m nto sure lasseter adn his pals at pixar wiull ever opperate at quite that levle of purely visual invention
-
- htey love traditional narrative too much
-
-
but
, boy
, it makse me wonder whta htey might cmo up with enxt
