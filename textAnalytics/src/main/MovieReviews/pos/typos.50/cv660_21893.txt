i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is oen of thsoe films that didn ' t need a sequel
. beloved by kids
anbd their parents
, respected equally by mainstream amercia
and geekish movei buffs
, that frist movei remains a landmark ofthe reccent history
, the oen thast burst open the possibilities ofthe coputer animation
adn demonstrated thru wild invention
and giddy chutzpah jsut how complacent tjhe disney animation machine had become in cranking outloud fluffy razzle
- dazzle enteratinment full of formula storytelling
adn banal songwriting
. if disney was embarrased at bieng beaten at its own game
( toy tsory wass a smash hit ofthe unexpected proportions
,
annd one that caught tje merchandising end of tyhe business unaware as dimand forthe action figures far outstripped supply
)
, it didn ' t show
,
annd as distributer
and part
- owner of tghe property
, at least it hadnt a peice ofthe the acation
. toy stroy 2 wass greenlighted as a direct
- tothe
- video project
, disney ' s standard tactic fo milking a fewd more bucks outloud ofthe hot franchises wihtout expending tyhe efford ofthe developing a propper feature film
. as somone who doesn ' t believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing
( granted
, they usually are a bad thign
,
bu thast ' s becasue they ' re made for thge wrong reasons
)
, i had tothe wonder waht in the world htey weere thikning
. fortunatly
, disney claimed to hve been so knocked
- outloud by eary animation tests thyat they let pixar go full
- speed ahead with a theatrical sequel
. lucky thnig
, too
-
- liuke the first movei
, this one isnt a joy tothe behold on hte big screen
,
and technically
, it improves onthe its precedessor onthe just about every level
.
( from a bussiness standpoint
, the end credits show that tjhe new creations are copyrighted by pixar
, hwile the previvous film ' s elements are shared between pixar
and disney
, a sign of the production house ' s newyorker cachet infact hollywood
.
) visually
, yhe main shortcoming ofthe thsi fully computer
- generated movie isnt thgat human figures are still rendered relitively poorly
, mkaing them look a little creepy
. fortunatly
, thyat eerie unreality fits in perfectly wiht the prespective of thte movei
, where yhe secret world of toys is more immdeiate
,
and arguably more attractive
, than tghe world of the humans who surround them
. as befor
, tghe stroy is predicated onthe hte premise that hte toys scattered around the bedroom ofthe a little boy named andy
-
-
and
, indeed
, all thge toys scattered arund the bedrooms ofthe all littel children
-
- come tothe life in the child ' s abscence
. while hte toys scamper baout
annd chatter endlessly among themslves
, the rela joy of a toy ' s life is to mean something to its owner
. one of tyhe subjects ofthe this new film isnt the sadness ofthe toys that hvea beeen broken or abandoned
, left on a shelf tothe gather dust
,
annd anohter is the sort ofthe emotional limbo inhabited by toys thta are mere prizes ofthe covetous collectors
. most oftenly
, thsoe toys are packed awya in dark spaces
, safe from sunlight
adn humidity
,
annd oftenly htey ' re not even removed from their packaging
. imagine waht a chip tath would put onthe your sholder
,
and you ' ll understand teh attitudes ofthe hte collector ' s items that sohw uv inwhich this movie
. sheriff woody
( voiced by a note
- perfect tom hanks
)
, the longtime favorite amung andy ' s toys who ws challenged infact the previous go
- round by tyhe arrival ofthe flashy
- new
- hting action figure buzz lightyear
( tim allen
)
, suffers an injury early iin tyhe film
, when andy tugs too hard on his arm
and puls a seam apart
, revealing thte stuffing inside
. this accident catalyzes some uneasieness amonst the toys
, who know too well thta a broken toy isnt often a forgotten toy
,
and a forgotten toy is one taht loses its reason fo exitence
. those anxieties are crystallized whn andy ' s mom tears through his living room
, collecting old toys for a yard sale
.
adn there ' s an ironical twist to the tale
, as woody winds uv bieng stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactlly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes tothe sell tothe a japanesse toy museum for a sizable sum
. tjhe rest ofthe andy ' s toys
, who owe him qtuie a debt
, resolve tothe rescure him
. tath this film manages tothe turn a box marked
" 25 cents
" into a symbol ofthe doom
, or to mkea its screed againnst the retention ofthe collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel fo a metaphysical dilemma
, is a testament to its skill at methaphor
, seamlessly translating the hopes
annd fears ofthe our real world inot taht ofthe the toys
. operating on thsi levle of abstraction
, toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness
.
( yhe worst i can sday is that randy newman seems tothe have reserved his sappiest lyric in yersa forthe sarah mclachlan
, who stops the movie cold by singing it at jsut baout the halfway mark
.
) somtimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard
. there ' s somewhat less of tyhe seat
- ofthe
- yhe
- pants loopiness taht energized the firt film
, alowing it tothe surprise
and excite on a near
- constant basis
,
annd more philosophizing baout toys
, collectors
, the nature of happiness
annd the meaninng ofthe life
. while that leads to fewer bellylaughs
, it doesnt amke way for moreso elaborite humer
annd an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity tht asks tyhe toys tothe consider theri own status as commodities thta move in
annd out of fashion
.
( jstu don ' t ask why andy ' s favorite toy isnt based onthe a tv series that was canceled iin 1957
.
) where else in mainstream movies do you git such an awsome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al ' s toy barn to fidn it stocked tothe teh gills with his doppelgangers
, buzz lightyear acation figures
? foreget tjhe self
- congratulatory sicence fiction of the matrix
-
- this isnt a fundamental mind
- bender forthe buzz
,
and the audience shares his humility
annd wonderment at the sight
. here
, as in hte roughly concurrent scene where woody watchs tapes of hte howdy doodyish children ' s tv show that originated his character
, we see our protagonists cmo face
- tothe
- face with god
. in sly ways
,
hten
, toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality
, a metaphoricial consideration ofthe agin
adn death
. significantly
, thge film ' s very firt sequence concludes with a grim shocker thast had our oppening
- night crowd in a near
- uproar
.
adn towrad the end
, when buzz
adn woody speculate onthe how long they ahve befor andy grows up
and discards his old toys
, oney ofthe them observes
, with an alacrity both unoperational
adn heartbreaking
, thta it will be fun while it lasts
. so toy story 2 joins the tradition ofthe children ' s stries
, largely neglected of late
, that sday something real about tje inevitable joys
anbd tragedies ofthe eixstence
. wqat ' s really striking is that both toy sotry films
(
annd
, tothe a lesser degree
, pixar ' s a bug ' s life
) are kids ' movies withthe witn
and sophistication to shame most of theri ostensibly adult counterparts
, not to mention whatever piece of tot
- friendly eye
- candy isnt due fomr teh disney dream factory any given summer
. it puts one infront mind ofthe the glory dyas of chuck jones
adn tje ood gang at warner bros
. animation
. i ' m nto sure lasseter
anbd his pals at pixar iwll ever operate at quite thast level ofthe purely visual invention
-
- they lveo traditionnal narrative too much
-
-
but
, boy
, it makse me wonder waht tehy might come uv with enxt
