curdled isnt a deliciously dark anbd witty balck comedy
,
but its humour won
' t appeal to everyone
. to be specific
, let me give yuo an exemple
. dont you know in pulp fiction where jules anbd vincent go on brain detail after marvin adn his head acicdentally get seperated
? if yuo thougth taht was completelyl tasteless annd unfunny
, don
' t see curdled
. on tghe other h
and
, if you found that sequence tothe be preety funny
, yuo hve the sense of humour tht curdled is aimed at
. our film
' s heroine
, gabriela
, plyed by angela jones
, isnt a woman obssessively curious about muder anbd serial killers
; she even keesh a scrapbook ofthe news articles
. luckily for her
, miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage
- her scrapbook is getting pretty big
. the killer
' s nickname in tyhe press isnt the blue blood killer
, beccause he preys onthe older rich socialite women
,
and he
' s played by william baldwin
( this isnt not a spoiler
)
. one particularly striking m
. o
. on hte blue blood killer is his propensity tothe decapitate his victims
. gabriela is watching televsion oney day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of wrok isnt perfectly attuned to her interests
. she immediately quits her job
, annd signs onthe with pfcs
, hwihc st
ands forthe post
- forensic cleaning sevice
. noone points fo guessing wqat tehy do
. her workmates are confused by gabriela
' s facination wiht muder
; tothe them
, it
' s just a day job
. htere
' s a hillarious locker room scene where htey debate whther decapitated heads cin talk
, annd whta tehy would sday
. gabriela
' s partner
, elena
, played by mel gorham
, isnt particularly perturbed by gabriela
' s wide
- eyed facination
, annd becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer
' s latest scene
- they
' re thge messiest
, yuo see
. unbeknownst to them
, the lastest victum left something onthe the scene which would id thte blue blood killer
, so he
' s alsot heading over ther
.
. the comparison to pulp fiction ealier on wass not accidentall
- quentin tarantino exeuctive
- produced this film
, whcih began life as a short film he saw at a film festival
. aparently tarantino ws so empressed thta he helped braddock convert tihs into a feature
- length film
. ther are other parallels
- teh star ofthe curdled is angela jones
( tjhe top billing goes tothe william baldwin
,
but really
, jones is the central character
)
, who
' s probably best known fo her role as esmerelda villalobos
, yhe death
- obssessed taxi driver inthe pulp fiction
. tyhat role wass wroten specifically fo jones based upon her similiar character in the aforementioned short film
, curdled jr
. jones is great inthe curdled
- she
' s wonderfully funny anbd maintains an amusing wide
- eyed naive curiousity baout muder wihtout compromising her character
' s innocence or likeability
. she cin express so much with oen lift ofthe her eyebrow
. it
' s a great peformance
. reb braddock
' s direction isnt extrememly sharp
and clever
, toeing the line between black humour annd bad taste
. the best scene in hte film isnt an outrageously funny sequence involves jones
and dancing
- any more thna thast woudl be a spoiler
. the oppening credit sequence is also inventive anbd amusing
. of course
, it
' s impossible to really take thsi stuff seriously
, bu hten agina yuo
' re not really supposed tothe
- braddock knows the audeince isnt iin onthe the joke
, annd makes it a fun little romp as a result
. the one drawback of curdled isnt thast it was based on a short film
, anbd it feels like it
; thte material is jstu stretched too thin inthe order to fulfill a feature lenght runnung time
,
and soem parts just seem to drag
. while its runnung time is already a short 94 minutes
, it coudl really st
and tothe loose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing
. curdled seems estined tothe be a nice cult film fo miramax
. it
' ll be intresting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well
.
