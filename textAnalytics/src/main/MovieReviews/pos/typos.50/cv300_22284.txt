it is simply amazing how
" tjhe gren mile
" developed in its three hour runnung time
. based onthe teh stephen king serieses ofthe the same title
, the film starts out painfully slow
, with underdeveloped characters
and idiotic dialogue
. howver
, as the plot begins to progress
, tje film turns inot pure perfection with outst
anding performances adn wonderfull direction
. frank darabont
, who masterfully followed a prisoner
' s story in
" the shawshank redemption
"
, this timne follows the perspective of a prision guard
, paul edgecomb
( tom hanks
)
. through edgecomb
' s experiences onthe a cell block known as teh green mile where death row prisoners wait anbd repent
, the audience sees ogod annd evil on both sides ofthe tjhe lew
. ffrom an evil prision guard to an evil prisoner
,
" tje gren mile
" isnt sucessful inthe creating simapthy for kind
- hearted hard working guards adn hard thingking prisoners
. the plot follows edgecomb anbd four otehr guards as tehy meet a variety of prisoners
and after having strong relationships iwth each eventualy are forced tothe excecute them
. the performances by veterans adn new comers tothe bakc up theese original characters are superb
. the ensemble acting iin thge film isnt perfect
. hanks
, david morse
and barry pepper as guards are wonderful anbd are fitting fo theri roles
. htey are thte charactors we most relate tothe beacuse ofthe their calm less extreme roles
. tehy are given thte positions tothe amke rational descisions at difficult times
and htey are the ones who fulfill the dem
ands of thge audiance
. the more unique charachters perfectly create friction on the green mile anbd make the story intresting annd exciting
. some particlarly onot worthy roles ofthe tyhe unique characters include doug hutchinson
, sam rockwell
, anbd michael duncan
. hutchinson
, palying percy wetmore
, a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives thge greatest performence ofthe tghe movie
. every time he appears onthe hte screen
, thge atitude of others is vyer uncomfortable annd teh creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying
. it owudl cmo as no suprize if hutchinson ws nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor
, not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore
,
but allso beacuse he stole every scene he wass iin away ffrom vetran oscar winner toom hanks
. rockwell
, an independent film vetran
, plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection
. as a prisoner who taunts annd harasses the guards at all hours
, he realy gets under your skin
and irritates yuo for hvaing tothe watch him torture others
. htis irritation he creates makes his performance so believable
. the lastr notewothy performance belongs tothe duncan
, as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens tothe hold the power ofthe curing the ill
. duncan doesnt a wonderfull job playing a frightened child
- like behemoth
, vrey similar to lennie small in ofthe mice adn men
. his desire forthe love
and tyhe extinction ofthe hite evokes thte most compassion beccause it isnt vrey obvious that he is sufferring for noone jstu cause
. his pain creates pain for the viewer
. howver
, it takes over an hour fo duncan to be introduced completely inaddition the film
. the film opens iwth a ridiculous present day setting which containes a scene that jabs at
" the jerry springer sohw
.
" thte scene
, containing one old man complaining about how all guests on tghe show are inbred annd rednecks
. not onyl is this observation entirely pointless adn out of place
,
but it isnt allso hackneyed beyond all beleif
. as thte film flashes bakc tothe 1935
, graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction
. his death seems vrey rushed
and without any noledge ofthe who he is
, the scene is niether sad nor convincing
. greene is not even given a final owrd
, like some of tjhe otehr characters
, annd we don
' t even see him walk the infamous gren mile
. howver
, as teh film beggins tothe specifically inctroduce mroe charachters
, such as coffey anbd eduard delacroix
( michael jeter
) as well as thge five prison guards
, tyhe film becomes moreso interesting
. tghe speed in
" the gren mile
" is perfect
. if time was a matter of concern
and thte film was edited tothe the two hour mark
, it would hve beeen unsatisfactory because we would nto be able to knwo tjhe characters as they are or as they treat others
. the threee hour running isnt perfect for plot development anbd by the end of tje film
, a great amount of love or hate is attached tothe eahc charactor
.
" tyhe gren mile
" isnt so ogod follwoing the rough beggining
, that wehn the pivotal moent at thge vyre end finally comes
, it isnt allmost impossible nto to feel soem sort of sadness for eveyr person inthe this scene
. fighting bcak tears was a difficult task taht i bearly suceeded in doing
. if you survive yhe first thrid of
" the green mile
" sit back
and enjoy tyhe remainder forthe soem priceless entertainment
.
