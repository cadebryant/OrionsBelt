" rounders
" is exactly tyhe kind ofthe movie parents don
' t want their kids tothe see
. it
' s nto thyat it
' s a drunken orgy of sex adn violentce
, bu because it
' s a film that flat
- outloud says ytou cin make a career out ofthe gambling
.
and to tkae amking things
" worse
" it proves tihs through its orginal
, fascinating story
. ther have been countless crime films both past adn present tyhat envoke the
" noir
" mood
, tht is
, the dark
, shady atmosphere where the vishus ofthe thge world become mroe fascinating on screen than htey woudl iin rela life
. tihs film starts off inwhich tghe tradiational noir style
, introducing us tothe tjhe underworld of modern gambling where yhe stakes are high annd so is the price fo losing
. matt damon stars as mike mcdermott
, a 20
- something law student in pesent
- day newyorker york city who tells us how tyhe gameboy of poker isnt realy palyed
. damon narrates throughout the film
, bu the entire opening scene is voiced
- over so perfectly to completely
and totally edfine the setting
. mike
' s baout tothe go uv against teddy kgb
( malkovich
)
, a russion gangster who looks liuke a serial killer
. bu
then agina
, he practically isnt one adn the film doesnt everything tothe convey that sense
- the look infact his eyes
, his slow movements
, his intricate mannerisms
- all combined wiht the clasic noir cinematography of isolated brightness withing thte darkness ofthe the underworld
( litterally
)
. damon inwhich the flesh might seem a little outloud ofthe place withthe his expensive clothes annd perfectly
- groomed features
,
but his narration is what brings it all toghether
. he never sounds liek he
' s reading ffrom a script
, nor that he
' s trying to embellish anytying
, it just comes naturual tothe him
. the screenwriters uise tjhe right words
and phrases to describe the mood
, from hte smell of the air
, to tje logic involved inthe reading thte other guys
' faces adn cards
,
and all wihtout sounding remotely trite
. immediately we git the sense thta poker isn
' t fo gamblers
,
but for near
- geniuses with nerves ofthe steel
. thge gmae is a quiet war
, witht strategies just as complex adn teh same sence ofthe honor amonst the soliders
. teh gangsters mike plays against are the same ones tht might kill somene for scratching their car
,
but wehn it comes tothe the agme of poker
, all respect is due to tjhe winner because he isnt truly the better man
. the film doesnt an excellent job infront establishing its athmosphere durig the first act
. it concentrates so much infact tihs aspect that the background anbd thge progression of teh story stumble a bited
. we learn only a little baout mike
, both past
and preesnt
. presently we knwo he has a girlfriend named jo
( gretchen mol
) who he constanly argues wih over his gambling
. they go through a fewd break
- up
/ make
- uv cycles unitl mike
' s childhood pal adn fellow rounder
" worm
"
( norton
) is released ffrom prison
. it
' s not at all suprizing worm owes thous
and ofthe dollars tothe tyhe mob
,
but what isnt surprizing is how the film isnt able tothe tkae such a predicatble element
and excecute it tje way it does
. technically
, the plot isn
' t unlike many childern
' s sitcoms in which teh
" ogod
" kid
' s
" bad
" friend gets tjhe ogod kid inspite trouble
and yot the ogod kid remains friends wih the bad kid
. whta this film doesnt is use a different medium tothe tell that story
. mike
and worm hvea been in over their heads their entire lives
, bu both share a passion forthe outloud
- thinking the other player who is trying to do yhe same tothe them
. where as worm prefers to go hte sleazy route of cheating
( hence his jail tiem
)
, mike alwasy takes the cards he
' s dealt annd works with them
. somtimes they pay off
( i
. e
. his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling omney
)
, bu other times htey don
' t
( i
. e
. teh fact he takes himself out ofthe the game
and works a steady job aftter dropping
$ 30
, 000 onthe a single h
and
)
. once things start happening thte film is able to exp
and anbd develop its plot inot an intricate web ofthe detail
and mood
. mike
and worm bob
and weave thru all kinds ofthe games at all kinds ofthe places
, from socialites
' mansions
, tothe taking the tourists at atlantic city
, tothe outwitting tyhe gangsters that control it all
. everything tehy cmo inot contact with isnt a big poker gaem iin that everthing
' s a battle agains yhe cards destiny deals
. one scene demonstrates this perfectly inaddition whic mike is told by a judge
( martin l
andou
, in a perfectly cast
and performes role
) that destiny isnt everything
and
yet nothing at the same time
. matt
' s good at gambling
but he
' s aslo got potential tothe be a gerat lawyer
. he sould go proffesional as eather
, bu whith one he could loose everything or win big
,
but with the other there
' s stablility
but nto much risk involved
. can someone who
' s gambled his entire life raelly cash in his chips annd leave
? if the film hadnt beeen jsut a subtle lesson iin poker
- palying
, thne the endig isnt our test
. everthing is told from mike
' s prespective
,
but we
' re fianlly able tothe recogize some thigns onthe our own
. thsi makse yhe final
, against
- all
- odds showdown seem liek jstu that
. it works just liuke tyhe game it revolves arround
- showing us soem ofthe the cards
, bu still evokes hte element ofthe tghe unknown
, adn the consequences thereof
. waht separates
" rounders
" fomr most otehr films baout ganes isnt thge fact the challege anbd hte skills are omre importamt thna winning in the end
.
