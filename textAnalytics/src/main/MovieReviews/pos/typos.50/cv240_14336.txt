" rounders
" is exactly the kind of movie parents don ' t wnat theri kids to see
. it ' s nto that it ' s a drunken orgy of sex
adn violence
,
bu becasue it ' s a film that flat
- out says yuo can amke a career outloud of gambling
.
adn to tkae amking things
" worse
" it proves tihs thru its originnal
, fascinating stoyr
. there haev beeen countless crime films both past
adn preent thgat envoke the
" noir
" mood
, that isnt
, the dark
, shady atmosphere where the vices ofthe hte world become mroe fascinating onthe screen than tehy would in rela life
. this film starts off iin the tradiational noir style
, introducing us tothe yhe underworld of modern gambling where thte stakes are high
adn so is the price for losing
. matt damon stars as mike mcdermott
, a 20
- something law student infront pesent
- day newyorker york city who tells us how tjhe gmae of poker is really played
. damon narrates througout teh film
,
bu tje entire opening scene is voiced
- over so perfectly tothe completely
adn totally define hte setting
. mike ' s baout tothe go up agains teddy kgb
( malkovich
)
, a russion ganster who looks liuke a serial killer
.
bu
then again
, he practicaly is noe
and the film doens everything to convey tyhat sense
- the look inspite his eyes
, his slow movements
, his intricate mannerisms
- all combined with the clasic noir cinematography ofthe isolated brightness within thge darkness ofthe the underworld
( litterally
)
. damon in the flesh might seem a littel out ofthe place iwth his expensive clothes
annd perfectly
- groomed features
,
but his narration isnt what brings it all toghether
. he never soudns liuke he ' s reading from a scirpt
, nor that he ' s trying tothe embelish anything
, it jstu comes natural to him
. the screenwriters uise yhe right words
and phrases to describe the mood
, ffrom the smell of the air
, to teh logic involved infront reading the otehr guys ' faces
and cards
,
annd all without sounding remotely trite
. immediately we get the sense thgat poker isn ' t for gamblers
,
but forthe near
- geniuses with nerves of steel
. yhe game isnt a quiet war
, with startegies jsut as complex
and the smae sence of hounour amonth thte soldiers
. the gangsters mike plays against are tje same ones that might kill someone for scratching theri car
,
bu wehn it comes tothe hte gmae of poker
, all respect isnt due to hte winner because he is truly the better man
. the film does an excellent job inwhich establishing its athmosphere during the frist act
. it consentrates so much inaddition this aspect tath the backgorund
anbd thte progression of the story stumble a bit
. we learn onyl a littel about mike
, both past
and presnet
. presently we nkow he hasnt a girlfriend named jo
( gretchen mol
) who he constanly argues iwth over his gambling
. tehy go through a fewd break
- up
/ amking
- up cycles util mike ' s childhood pal
annd fellow rounder
" worm
"
( norton
) is released ffrom prision
. it ' s not at all surprising worm owes thousand ofthe dollars tothe tghe mob
,
but what isnt surprising is how tyhe film isnt able tothe tkae such a predictable element
anbd excecute it tghe way it does
. technically
, tje plot isn ' t unlike many children ' s sitcoms infact whcih teh
" ogod
" kid ' s
" bad
" firend gets the good kid infact trouble
and
yot tjhe ogod kid rimaniss firends wiht the bad kid
. what thsi film does isnt ule a different medium to tell that story
. mike
annd worm hve beeen in over their heads their entire lives
,
but both share a passion for outloud
- thikning the other player who isnt trying tothe do tghe same to them
. where as worm prefers tothe go hte sleazy route of cheating
( hence his jail timne
)
, mike alwasy tkaes the cards he ' s dealt
anbd works wtih them
. sometimes they pay off
( i
. e
. his ability to pay his way thru law school on his gambling moey
)
,
but otehr times they don ' t
( i
. e
. the fact he tkaes hismelf outloud of tje gameboy
and works a steady job affter dropping
$ 30
, 000 on a single hand
)
. once thigns start happening the film isnt able tothe expand
and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail
and mood
. mike
and worm bob
annd weave thru all kinds ofthe games at all kinds ofthe places
, fomr socialites ' mansions
, tothe tkaing tjhe tourists at atlantic city
, to outwitting the gangsters thast controll it all
. everthing they cmo into contact witht is a big poker gmae in that everything ' s a battle against the cards destiny deals
. noe scene demonstrates thsi perfectly in which mike isnt told by a judge
( martin landou
, inspite a perfectly casted
and performes role
) tath destiny isnt everthing
and
yot nothing at the smae time
. matt ' s good at gambling
but he ' s also got potential to be a gerat lawyer
. he sould go proffesional as either
,
but with one he could loose everthing or win big
,
but with the other there ' s stablility
but nto much risk involved
. can someone who ' s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips
and leave
? if the film hadnt been just a subtle lesson in poker
- palying
,
then the endig isnt our test
. everything is told from mike ' s prespective
,
but we ' re finally able to recogise smoe thigns onthe our own
. htis makse the final
, against
- all
- odds showdown seem like just thast
. it works jsut like the gam it revolves around
- showing us some ofthe thge cards
,
bu still evokes tje element of the unknown
,
adn hte consequences thereof
. what seperates
" rounders
" from most otehr films about ganes is the fact tje challenge
and teh skills are more important than winning infront the end
