with the opening scene of a young cuple in a van pulling up
, loading thier guns
, kissing eahc otehr
adn uttering waht soudns like
" rock
anbd roll
!
"
( atually
, it ' s
" lock
and load
"
)
, yuo can ' t help thikning tarantino
.
and of course wih its storyline ofthe a crazy girl
annd boy inspite love who turn to violent bank robbery
, the film unapologetically tkaes its place alongside all those otehr films from bonnie
& clyde tothe natural born killers
.
bu if most ofthe thsoe movies hve their roots inspite pulp fiction
, exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on tjhe run
, normal life takes a much more psychologically realsitic look at the phenomonon
.
" inspired by true events
"
-
- we ' ve herad that noe befoer
,
and
yot in noone otehr tale ofthe violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated
.
.
. or so strangely poignant
. for htis is a stry of rela people whose lives tkae onthe a steadily unreal quaity
, who inwhich their esarch forthe a normal life find themselfs increasingly unhinged
. beginning witht theri fianl arrest
, tjhe film goes bakc tothe trace yhe relationship between chris
( luke perry
)
, a policeman
,
adn pam
( ashley judd
)
, a factory worker
. htey fall infront loev
adn marry
,
but pam ' s increasingly erratic behaviour
( goign on spending sprees
, slashing herself with a knife affter an arugment
) begin tothe trouble teh solid
and stable chris
. wehn chris gets sacked
, they fidn themslves heavily in debt
anbd near breaking up
.
then
, chris begins tothe rob banks
.
.
. luke perry accomplishes the not
- inconsiderable feat ofthe making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer
. moustached
, witht a tough paternal look
and
yet a voice
and eyes that suggest sadness verging onthe exasperation
, he is perfectly casted as yhe long
- suffering husband
.
( it ' s anohter of john mcnaughton ' s coups ofthe casting
- against
- type
, after transforming robert de niro into nerd
and bill murray inot gangster inspite mad dog
annd glory
)
.
bu it is the character of pam who commands centrestage
,
and ashley judd rises tothe tjhe challange wtih gerat alternating currents ofthe ferocity
adn tenderness
, making pam inot a fascinating
yet often infuriating person
. if the performance falls short of greatness
,
howver
, it is perhpas because the role of the mad woman hasnt been done so often befor it is virtually a staple ofthe cinema
, whther it ' s inthe betty blue
, tom
& viv or georgia
. as in those movies
, there ' s the danger that the performance seems mannered
, a collection of screwy tics
and tantrums desgined for the oscar presentation peice
. judd doesn ' t entirely avoid tihs pitfall
,
bu pam ' s ' craziness ' is best
and most movingly presented infact counterpoint to teh more ' normal ' chris
. when pam reacts to her father
- in
- law ' s death by showing up at the funeral inspite rollerblades
and blaring hedaphones
, chris ' face is the picture ofthe pained restraint
. ofthe course
, it ' s tje question ofthe what is ' normal ' that isnt asked in normal life
. mcnaughton constanly offers up the ironies ofthe the aspirations forthe the averege domestic life
anbd its kinship witht insanity
. it is thge rational chris thta loves guns
(
" shooting is baout precision
, control
"
)
and tjhe ' crazy ' pam thgat loves astronomy
and yearns fo a dog
( who is
then called chaos
-
-
" chaos
and you
and me
.
.
. we ' re a real famaly
"
, she notes wryly
)
. it isnt chris ' methodical mind
and his noledge of polical procedure tyhat allows him to be such a successful bank robber
( his well
- planned disguise as a bearded
, roaring man of terror is another piece of method infact madness
)
. infront the carpark where he sets outloud for his first robbery
, a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out inwhich tghe backgorund
:
" buy
- more
"
-
- the perfectly respectable consumption
- crazy american dream thgat has driven pam tothe her extravagent purchases
,
adn both ofthe them inot desperate situations
. it ' s not a perfect film
. some of thte dialogue isnt a touch too banal
( perhaps intentionally
?
)
. the uise of tghe punk hardcore sountrack inthe pam ' s crazed scenes comes rather too close tothe making emotional disturbance seem glamourous
and sexy an omage whlch onyl detracts fomr tje rest ofthe tyhe film
. indeed
, as in mcnaughton ' s seminal film henry
: potrait of a serial killer
, it is tjhe avoidance ofthe glamour or sensationalism
, tghe denial of some of tghe standard thrills ofthe the outlaw film genre
, thgat gives thsi determinedly unflashy
, moving film its great strengths
. mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet
, cooly ' realistic ' method that works far better tahn any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer
. the suburbs
, witht their miles ofthe white
- fenced houses
anbd identikit malls
, tkae on a sense ofthe claustrophobic blankness
. iin its vrey different way
, tihs makes fo as haunting a backdrop as tje wide opne spaces in terence malick ' s badlands
. hwile pam shares thge yearnings ofthe malick ' s ehroes tothe escape fomr ordinary life
, chris tkaes uv crime precisely so that tehy can lead a ' normal life '
- their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies
.
but theese are dreasm deffined by
, constrained by
,
and even doomed by
, the limitations of the ' normal '
, convetional world
. pam ' s final scene takes place at tghe edge ofthe hte suburbs
, where wild bushes grwo
-
- symbolically the frontier
, the outer lmits ofthe her society
,
but also quite litterally tghe end of the road
, where ther is nowhere left tothe go
bu tothe the fianl tradgic denouement
. the flying inkpot ' s rating system
:
* wait for teh video
.
*
* a littel creaky
,
but still better than staying at home whith gotcha
!
*
*
* preety ogod
, bring a freind

* amazing
, potent stuff
