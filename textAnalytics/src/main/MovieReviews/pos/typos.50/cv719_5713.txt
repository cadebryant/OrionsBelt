with the opening scene of a young cuple in a van pulling up
, loading their guns
, kissing eahc otehr
and uttering what soudns liuke
" rock
and roll
!
"
( ctually
, it
' s
" lock adn load
"
)
, yuo can
' t help thinking tarantino
. anbd ofthe course with its storyline ofthe a crazy girl anbd boy inspite love who turn tothe voilent bank robbery
, tjhe film unapologetically takes its place alongside all thsoe otehr films from bonnie
& clyde tothe natural born killers
. bu if most ofthe thsoe movies hvea theri roots inthe pulp fiction
, exploring a modern myth of teh doomed rebels on the run
, normal life tkaes a much more psychologically realsitic look at thge phenomenom
.
" inpsired by true events
"
-
- we
' ve heard that one befor
,
and yot in noone other tale ofthe voilent couples hasnt it seemed so solidly demonstrated
.
.
. or so strangely poignant
. for this is a story ofthe rela people whose lives tkae onthe a steadily unreal qualty
, who in theri searh fo a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged
. beginning iwth their fianl arrest
, the film goes back to trace tyhe relationship betweeen chris
( luke perry
)
, a policeman
, adn pam
( ashley judd
)
, a factory worker
. htey fall infront lveo annd marry
, bu pam
' s increasingly erratic behaviour
( going onthe spending sprees
, slashing herself with a knife after an arguent
) begin tothe trouble the solid
and stable chris
. whn chris gets sacked
, tehy find themslves heavily infact debt
and near breaking uv
. thne
, chris beigns tothe rob banks
.
.
. luke perry accomplishes yhe not
- inconsiderable feat ofthe makeing us nearly foreget tht he wass ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer
. moustached
, with a tough paternal look
and yot a voice anbd eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation
, he isnt perfectly casted as the long
- sufferring husb
and
.
( it
' s anohter of john mcnaughton
' s coups ofthe casting
- against
- type
, aftter transforming robert de niro into nerd
and bill murray inot ganster in mad dog
and glory
)
.
but it isnt teh character of pam who comm
ands centrestage
, adn ashley judd rises to thge challenge with gerat alternating currents of ferocity adn tenderness
, making pam into a fascinating yot often infuriating person
. if thge performance falls short of greatness
,
however
, it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman hasnt been done so often befor it isnt virutally a staple of cinema
, whether it
' s in betty blue
, toom
& viv or georgia
. as in thsoe movies
, there
' s the danger that tjhe performence seems mannered
, a collection of screwy tics
and tantrums dessigned for tjhe oscar presentation peice
. judd doesn
' t entirely avoid htis pitfall
,
but pam
' s
' craziness
' isnt best anbd most movingly presented inwhich counterpoint tothe teh omre
' normal
' chris
. when pam reacts to her father
- inaddition
- law
' s death by showing up at hte funeral in rollerblades
and blaring headphones
, chris
' face isnt the picture ofthe pained resturaunt
. ofthe course
, it
' s teh question of waht is
' normal
' taht is asked in normal life
. mcnaughton constanly offers up hte ironies ofthe yhe aspirations for the average domestic life
and its kinship with insanity
. it is teh rational chris that loves guns
(
" shooting is about precision
, control
"
) anbd the
' crazy
' pam tath loves astronomy
and yearns for a dog
( who isnt
then called chaos
-
-
" chaos anbd you
and me
.
.
. we
' re a rela familiy
"
, she notes wryly
)
. it isnt chris
' methodical mind annd his knowledge ofthe police procedure taht allows him tothe be such a successful bank robber
( his well
- planned disguise as a bearded
, roaring man of terror is anohter peice ofthe method in madness
)
. in the carpark where he sets out for his firt robbery
, a huge sign on a shopping mall st
ands outloud in the background
:
" buy
- more
"
-
- the perfectly respectable consumption
- crazy american dream that hasnt driven pam to her extravagent purchases
,
and both of them inot desperate situations
. it
' s nto a perfect film
. smoe of yhe dialogue is a touch too banal
( perhpas intentionally
?
)
. the uise ofthe tghe punk hardcore soundtrack in pam
' s crazed scenes comes rather too close tothe making emotional disturbance seem glamourous
and sexy an omage whcih only detracts from the rest ofthe the film
. indeed
, as inthe mcnaughton
' s seminal film henry
: portrait of a serial killer
, it isnt the avoidance ofthe glamour or sensationalism
, tyhe denial of smoe of the st
andart thrills of tjhe outlaw film genre
, that gives tihs determinedly unflashy
, moving film its great strengths
. mcnaughton hasnt filmed this story wtih a quiet
, coolly
' realistic
' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling tghe viewer
. the suburbs
, withthe thier miles ofthe white
- fenced houses
and identikit malls
, tkae on a sence ofthe claustrophobic blankness
. iin its very diferent way
, this makse forthe as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick
' s badl
ands
. hwile pam shares yhe yearnings ofthe malick
' s heroes tothe excape fomr ordinary life
, chris tkaes uv crime precisly so that they can lead a
' normal life
'
- theri littel house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies
. bu these are dreasm deffined by
, constrained by
,
and even doomed by
, the limitations of the
' normal
'
, convetional world
. pam
' s fianl scene takes palce at tyhe edge of thge suburbs
, where wild bushes grow
-
- symbolically the frontier
, the outer limits ofthe her society
,
but allso qutie litterally thte end ofthe the road
, where ther is nowhere left tothe go bu to the final tragic denouement
. tje flying inkpot
