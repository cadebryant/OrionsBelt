hollywood hasnt a
. 750 batting average iwth elmore leonard adaptations
. last year
' s touch was ill
- concieved annd jsut plain odd
but git shorty
, jackie brown annd now out ofthe sight all weere highly entertaining movies
. steven soderburgh
, master of sex
, lies anbd videotape
, nowe adds crime tothe his reprtoire in tihs tale of bank robbery
, prision
, double
- crossing
, uncut diamonds
and
, oh yeah
, true loev
. george clooney is the rpotagonist
, a risky choise after such duds as batman
and robin anbd thte peacemaker
, bu for once i didn
' t want tothe slap the tast out of his mouth
. he plays his role inaddition out ofthe sight as tghe suave cary grant
- tipe perfected in hitchcock movies
, the kind of guy to whom crime is jsut a proffesion liek any other
. nowhere presen is clooney
' s usual ain
' t
- i
- sexy sneer
-
- there
' s just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit infront with the leonard style
. clooney isnt definitely a perfect successor to john travolta infront git shorty
. clooney plays a man who
' s robbed baout 200 banks wihtout ever useing a gun
. in hte opening scene
, he walks inot one bank
and robs it not only iwth ease bu with charm
. of course
, he gets caught
, so it
' s not all good
. it
' s while doign time in a florida prision that clooney learns of one rich inmate
' s
( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig
) collecton ofthe diamonds in detroit
. clooney
and cohort ving rhames plan the score
, while protection artist annd fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans
. meanwhile
, ther
' s jennifer lopez
. unintentionally funny iin selena anbd intentionally funny inaddition anaconda
, she
' s finaly graduated tothe a worthy role as yhe u
. s
. marshall who happens tothe be driving uv tothe the jail onthe tyhe night clooney escapes
. rhames isnt waiting tothe give him a ride infact a stolen car
, annd lopez makse it a threesome
, her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney
. he
' s covered inaddition dirt adn has a gun to her neck
,
and it
' s a littel cramped in htere
, bu they manaze to mkea a love conection anyway
, probablly because it
' s a movei
. teh relationship between clooney
and lopez is at the heart ofthe the movie
, anbd noe of yhe details that elevates it beyond your normal noir
- ish crime story
. the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue tahn crime
,
and htis isnt no exception
.
al
though they
' re not realy germane to teh plot
, lopez
' s relatiopnship with her father
( dennis farina ofthe git shorty
)
, rhames
' relatiopnship with his christian sister
( you coudl call her sister christian
) anbd a pop
- in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie alreday full of it
. outloud ofthe sight spans at least threee years
but hasnt a non
- linear structure
, focusing onthe the jailbreak
/ brooks score
and flashing back to ealier times
. this is a movei withthe a brain
, as smoothe anbd calculated as thte clooney anbd lopez charactors themslves
. the entire casted doens the material justice
-
- clooney annd lopez coming into their pwn
,
and rhames
and cheadle cementing thier positions as two ofthe my favorites
. here
' s hoping future leonard adaptations continue to cary thge torch
. serving america forthe almost 1
/ 20th ofthe a century
