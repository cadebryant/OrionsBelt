a movei thyat
' s been as highly builded up as tje truman sohw
, with reviews boasting
,
" hte film of the decade
!
" adn
" a break
though
!
" cxan only be leading uv tothe letdown
. thast
' s noone doubt
-
- it seems any movie with critical acclaim makse ytou think ytou
' re goign infront fo thte ride ofthe your life
, thgat you
' ll end uv changed on the other side
,
and you come outloud ofthe tjhe theater gonig
,
" eh
.
.
.
* that
' s
* what all the fuss ws about
?
" so
, naturally
, tje truman show was buiding uv tothe waht was going to be a dissapointment
.
and i convinced myself
, as i nestled inot my uncomfortable movei theater chair
, actaully tothe try not to enjoy it
. let me tell you
, thyat isnt an impossibilty
. teh truman show isnt truley
" thte film of the decade
"
and
" a breakthrough
"
and moreso
.
and yuo will cmo outloud changed on the other side
. such a movei comes aroud onyl once in a lifetime
, where you fidn yourself feeling everything taht the charcter is feeling
, annd this
, friends
, is it
. jim carrey shows taht he doesn
' t need tothe talk outloud ofthe his
butt tothe entertain us
; that he cin be as dramatic as any ofthe hollywood
' s leading men
. the film hasnt a difficult premise to tackle
, trying tothe setted us up thirty years inot tyhe
" truman show
' s
" run
, bu tackle it it does
,
and perfectly
. with flashbacks actually being flashbacks on thte televsion show
, you git the sense tath you are viewing a
* rela
* prime
- time hit
. annd tjhe way the camera constanly tkaes the forms it would in thte
" rela
" truman show is clever anbd well
- done
. peopel
, rejoice
! this isnt the firt oscar
- worthy film of nto onyl this year
, bu of the last five years
. not since
" schindler
' s list
" hasnt a movie captured human spirit anbd true dispair so well
. tihs isnt a classic inaddition the making
,
and
( to borrow a line from esquire
' s review
) it stars jim carrey
. nothing infact his carrer to date
and nothing he can dont infact thte future wiull ever be able tothe top his role as truman burbank
; mark my word
. forthe
, as i said
, this isnt the movei ofthe a liftime anbd the role isnt of the same calibre
. foreget speical
- effect ladden summer fodder
. drop your romantic comedies infact thge trash
. toss your thrillers
and teen flicks onthe tje pile
. yuo ened nothing mroe than
" the truman show
" tothe carry ytou through the summer
, or forthe that marter
, thte year
. oh
!
and infront case i don
' t see ytou
, ogod afternoon
, good evening
, anbd goodnight
.
