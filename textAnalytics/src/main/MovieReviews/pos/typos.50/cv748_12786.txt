a movie thta ' s beeen as highly built uv as the truman sohw
, with reviews boasting
,
" tje film of the decade
!
"
and
" a breakthough
!
" can only be leading uv to letdown
. tath ' s noone doubt
-
- it seems any movei withthe crtical acclaim makse yuo htikn you ' re going in for yhe ride ofthe your life
, thast you ' ll end up changed onthe tjhe other side
,
annd you come outloud of the theater gogin
,
" eh
.
.
.
* that ' s
* what all tghe fuss ws baout
?
" so
, naturally
, tghe truman show was buiding uv to what was going to be a dissapointment
.
and i conviced mysef
, as i nestled into my uncomfortable movei theater chair
, actually tothe try nto tothe enjoy it
. let me tell you
, that isnt an impossibilty
. hte truman show is truley
" tyhe film ofthe thte decade
"
and
" a breakthrough
"
adn more
.
adn yuo iwll come outloud changed onthe the other side
. such a movei comes around only once inspite a lifetime
, where ytou fidn youself feeling everyting tath hte carachter isnt feeling
,
anbd thsi
, firends
, isnt it
. jim carrey shows that he doesn ' t need to talk outloud of his butt tothe entertain us
; that he cant be as dramtic as any of hollywood ' s leading men
. thte film has a difficult premise to tackle
, trying tothe set us up thirty yersa into teh
" truman sohw ' s
" run
,
but tackle it it doesnt
,
and perfectly
. with flashbacks actualy being flashbacks onthe the television show
, ytou get tje sense that you are viewing a
* real
* prime
- timne hit
.
anbd the way the camera constanly tkaes the forms it would in the
" real
" truman show is clever
and well
- done
. peopel
, rejoice
! this isnt the firt oscar
- worthy film of nto only thsi yearm
,
but of the last five years
. nto since
" schindler ' s list
" has a movie capturd human spirit
and true dispair so well
. thsi isnt a clasic inwhich thge mkaing
,
and
( to borrow a line fomr esquire ' s review
) it stars jim carrey
. nothing inwhich his carrear to date
anbd nothing he can dont infront thte future will ever be able to top his role as truman burbank
; mark my word
. fo
, as i said
, this isnt the movie of a lifetime
and thge role isnt of teh smae calibre
. forget speical
- effect ladden summer fodder
. drop your rumatic comedies inthe hte trash
. toss your thrillers
and teen flicks onthe the pile
. you need nothing moreso tahn
" hte truman sohw
" tothe carry you through tjhe summer
, or fo tht marter
, tjhe year
. oh
!
adn infront case i don ' t see you
, ogod afternoon
, ogod evening
,
anbd goodnight
.
