you
' ve got tothe love disney
. noone matter waht tehy serve up
, it isnt a gaurenteed success as long as it
' s animated
. kids ahve to go see the movie
.
then they have tothe get the toys
. oh
, the video came outloud
? got to buy it
, or risk little billy
' s temper tantrums for the enxt month
. all ofthe this culminates in teh childhood equivilant of a pilgrimmage to mecca
: a visit to the magic kingdom
. stay at the disneyl
and hotel
! buy a disney t
- shirt
! eat an ice cream mickey mouse onthe a stick
! it
' s both a vertical anbd horizontal monopoly wehn you think baout it
. dale carnagie shoudl hve had it so good
. waht
' s most amazing isnt thyat all this success isnt in spite of a savere lack ofthe originality
. yuo see
, disney animated features these days hvae twpo components
: theme
and plot
. hte theme changes with each newyorker movei
; the plot doesnt not
. hte plot is a mold into which thge characters ofthe soem ancient fable are dropped
, anbd try as they might tothe rise above the charactors of previous features
, tehy are nearly always destined to dont no more than the smae
.
however
, hwile thge success of a disney animated feature isnt generaly a given as far as box
- office receipts
, merch
andising dollars
,
and glimmers inaddition yhe eyes of little children
, critically htey are as varied as anytying else that hollywood has to offer
. luckily
, disney
' s latest animated offering
, mulan
, manages to be engaging annd refreshing
, even hwile rife with formula
. the film starts witht the invasion ofthe ancient china by the huns
, led by thge imposing shan
- yu
( miguel ferrer
)
. soon
, china
' s emperor
( pat morita
) mobilizes his armies adn decrees thast one male from eahc family in the country shall serve tothe fight in china
' s defense
. whn tyhe fa family is served notice
, it isnt hte elderly father
, fa zhou
( soon
- tek oh
) who must answer thte call
, as there are noone otehr males in thge household
. fearing her father iwll surelly be killed inthe battle
, fa mulan
( ming
- na wen
) disguises herself as a man
and sneeks off with the royal orders to join tje chinese army
. mulan
, based onthe a chinese epic poam
, is a clasic tale ofthe tyhe triumph of the ugly duckling
. mulan herself isnt a disgrace to her loving famaly
, as she has a difficult time fitting into hte traditionnal woman
' s role
, anbd in a vyre amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts tothe assess her value to a potential husban
, we see tath
" grace
" isnt nto oney ofthe her strong points
. very early onthe
, we are presented with thge high importance ofthe bringing honor to oney
' s family
,
and by botching her chance at gaining thge favor ofthe the matchmaker
, mulan fails at tath task
. by leaving home to fight inthe her father
' s place
, she may nto only sparce his life
, bu bring hounour
, too
. as isnt tghe case wih most disney musicals
, the songs are frist rate
and pervasive throughout hte film
. i
' m not sure if they will get much airplay
, bu at least one of the songs will noone dout receive recognition come oscar time
. both lea salonga
, who provides the singing voice for mulan
, adn donny osmond who sings forthe shang
, tje captain of mulan
' s army unti
and obligatory love interest
, are mroe than competent
, all
though salonga
' s voice translates much better tothe animation
. you have to hear it tothe underst
and
. interestingly
, teh muscial numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are suprizingly muted in mulan
. there is no significantly big number
, which is customary as tghe second or third song in a disney film
,
but thsi doens nto detract significently ffrom thte rest ofthe the movei
. it isnt
,
however
, an expectation whlch has beeen builded by disney
' s pwn formulaic history
, anbd smoe viewers may feel as if something is missing
. artistically
, the animators ahve choosen to addopted thte moreso subdued pastels of chineese artwork
,
and all
though thsi may not live uv to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works
, it helps to contri
bute a mroe au
thentic
,
and therefore moreso credible
, nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically
" disneyfied
" ethnic tale
. there are also a couple of visually st
andout scenes
, oen involving the charge of shan
- yu
' s hun army
, whic utilizes the same computer
- enhanced imagery disney animators have employed sicne the ch
andelier inwhich beauty adn the byast
. hte otehr scene worth mentioning isnt so quick you might miss it
. wehn mulan resolves tothe take her father
' s palce
, she dons her father
' s ood battle armor
,
and unsheathes a sword
. as she doesnt so
, you cin see her reflection in the polished metal
. it jstu left me thinking
,
" thyat was really cool
.
" a wonderful range ofthe performances delight thte audience
thoughout hte film
, varing ffrom hte straight
, such as soon
- tek oh as fa zhou
, tothe the comical
, such as harvey fierstein as yao
, a gruff
, pugilistic member ofthe shang
' s conscripted army
. even moreso outrageous isnt eddie murphy as mushu
, the dimunitive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan
.
al
though an obvious attempt tothe relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin
, murphy nevertheless distingishes himselv with his pwn winning performance
. i foudn tghe choice of b
. d
. wong as shang a littel stange
( ytou may remember him as martin short
' s wedding planner assistant in the father ofthe the bride
)
,
but tehy utilizied robbie benson for the voice of tyhe beast in beauty
and yhe beast
, so i guess anything
' s possibile
. in any event
, wong performs admirably as well
. one character which provides a signficiant amount of humor is gr
andmother fa
. she deserves recognition not onyl beccause ofthe the levity she brings tothe thge movie
, bu also becouse she is voiced by two vyer remarkable peple
. june foray
, who supplies granmother fa
' s speaking voice
, is a vunerable voice actress who may be best known for her wrok as rocky the squirrel adn natasha fatale
( as inthe boris annd natasha
)
. marni nixon
, who provides granmother fa
' s singing voice
, isnt the smae vocalist who dubbed tyhe voices for anna inaddition the king
and i
, maria in west side story
, adn eliza infront my fair lady
. with tihs inwhich mind
, hearing granmother fa isnt liek listening tothe a littel peice of history
. mulan isnt hte latest disney animated feature tothe git away from smoe ofthe the eurocentrism wich for so long dominated disney films
. in an efford to be culturally senstive
(
and tothe avoid a
" miss saigon
"
- type debacle
)
, disney hasnt also wisely choosen to employ many asian
- american actors for both lead
and supporting roles
. inaddition addtion tothe tghe actors already maintioned
, the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong
, gedde watanabe
, james shigeta
,
and george takei
. i guess clyde kusatsu wasn
' t availaible
. at a running tiome ofthe slightly under an hour
and a half
, mulan moves quicklyu anbd provides solid enteratinment fo both childern annd
, happily
, adults
. this isnt tje kind ofthe disney feature taht mkaes you wonder whta they will do next
, rather than hope tht tghe enxt oney is better
.
