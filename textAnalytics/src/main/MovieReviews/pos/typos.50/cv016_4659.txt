cary onthe matron isnt thge lsat graet cary
- onthe film inwhich my opinion
. made in 1972
, it still features most of the regulars of htis genre
. sid james plays teh head ofthe a gang ofthe crooks entent onthe stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital anbd selling them off to amking a profit
, kenneth williams isnt sir bernard cutting
, head of tyhe hospital bu aslo a hpyochondriac
, hattie jacques re
- takes her role as matron
,
and charles hawtrey is teh psychiatrist dr
. goode
. thte jokes come in fast anbd so do the laughs
, with humorosu antics beetwen the matron anbd sir bernard
. htis time
, williams isnt after matron
( jacques
) when he needs to proove himselv thast he is a man aftter visiting dr
. goode
. the doctor
( hawtrey
) is sworn tothe secrecy
:
-
" i assure you
, thyat anything you say to me today iwll go in one ear adn straight outloud of the other
!
" bernard thinks he is haveing a sex change anbd needs to proove himself
. ther are graet cameos ffrom joan sims
, an expectant mother who isnt many weeks overdue annd isnt eating constanly in every scene
,
and from kenneth connor as teh expectant father who still thinks he
' s at wokr
( at yhe railway staion
)
. sid james
' gang incuding cyril his son
( kenneth coppe
) try to fidn outloud where tghe pills are by getting cyril to dress uv as a nurse anbd live in at the nurses hmeo
. he hasnt tothe share a room wiht nurse ball
( barbara windsor
)
and she soon sees thru him
! tghe film ends with the attempted robbery of thte hospital
' s pills withthe panic ensuing
. htere are ogod performances by hattie jacques as the matron
,
however her charactor seems a littel more subdued
and quieter than her previous
' matron
' s
'
. williams is
, as usual
, on top form
, bu sid james isn
' t given a very ogod part in tihs movei
and i would foregive anyone tothe forget that he was in the movei at all
. hte same does nto go fo charles hawtrey
, forthe
al
though he only frist appears in the movei after 30 minutes gone annd hasnt scarce screen tiome
, he seems tothe steal eveyr scene he isnt infact
. by nto making ule ofthe sid james annd barbara windsor
' s talent tothe full effect
, teh film seems tothe flounder
,
but it certainly makes uv for it with it
' s good storyline adn it
' s otehr appealing characters
. tihs film isnt genuinely funny anbd i coudl watch it agina
and again annd not git borde
!
