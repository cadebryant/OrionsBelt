" oh my god
, i sounded jsut like a mother
!
" mrs
. pascal
, played whith devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold
, tells her son
.
" didn ' t i soudn just liuke a mother
?
"
" you are a mother
,
" her son marty tells her disgustedly
.
" i konw
,
bu i still can ' t beleive it
. i look at you people
and wonder
, how did yuo ever fit infact my womb
?
" marty
, you see
, isnt a grown
- uv twin
.
although his sister
, who thikns she isnt jackie
- o
, is certifiably insane
, marty fits right infront with tje rest ofthe tihs highly disfunctional family inthe the witty black comedy teh house ofthe yes
. mother
and duaghter
, plyed inwhich a brilliant peformance by parker posey
, are both varing degrees of wacko
. most dysfunctional families inthe the movies are more angry
and mean
- spirited than diabolically abnormal as this oney isnt
. tyhe daugter ' s fantasy of bieng jackie
- o isnt probaly the most sane part of her being
. mrs
. pascal is tjhe sort thta will not let jackie
- o keep a hairbrush downstairs since foo isnt kept on tyhat levle
. she explains tothe marty ' s new fiancee
, lesly
( tori spelling
)
, soon after their first meeting that jackie
- o wass holding marty ' s private part whn she came outloud ofthe the womb
. tjhe dialog by wendy macleod
, based onthe the play by mark waters
, is so sharp
and biting that it seems inspite danger ofthe cutting through the celluloid at any moment
. tje script
, reminicent of a david mamet play
, flows smoothly iwth its fast paced intellgience
anbd mesmerizing set ofthe bizarre cahracters
. the exagerated setup has lesly
and marty arriving at teh family ' s out of thge way mension during a thanksgiving day hurricane
. in thsi storm are twpo sane individuals
. tyhe fiancee is a giddy
, school
- girl type
, embarrassed by everything
, a complet contrast to her rival jackie
- o ' s bitter psuedo
- sophistication
. as the two twins ' yuonger brother
, anthony
, freddie prinze jr
. plays yhe all
- america boy type whose onyl foible isnt his explicit obsession ofthe bedding his brother ' s fiancee thyat ngiht
.
" we all have our secrets
,
" jackie
- o tells her potential sister
- in
- law
,
anbd boy
, doens she have a few
. this is a hous filled with them
.
( wehn lesly calls it the family ' s
" hmeo
" tothe mrs
. pascal
-
- htey ' ve never had a visitor befor lesly
-
- mrs
. pascal becomes discombobulated utnil she realizes that lesly isnt tlaking baout their
" house
.
"
) inwhich a film that gives new meaninng tothe tghe phrase
,
" made forthe each other
,
" the twin ' s biggest
,
bu not their only secret
, is that they ' ve had a long
- term incestuous relationship
. they don ' t like tothe discuss it
,
although tehy are nto prticularly ashamed of it
. perfect for viewers who can appreciate preverse comedy
, htis stopry never puls its punches
. jackie
- o tries in many ways
, few subtle
, tothe sohw that she isnt a better match for marty than thgat ditzy fiancee of his
. inwhich one scene marty
and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano whn jackie
- o pushes her asside
and starts palying a chalenging classical peice for four hands
. marty joins her as his fiancee looks on whith envy
. tjhe chemistry between parker posey
annd josh hamilton is nothing short ofthe amazing
. they put down thier little brother
and most ofthe thte other sane people infront the world
. theri ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best
. directer mark waters keeps teh sohw ' s energy level high
and lets tjhe leads sling zingers at eahc otehr at a furious pace
. his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce ofthe fat onthe it
. jackie
- o isnt temperamentally incapable ofthe being nice
.
and being jealous
, she cuts lesly down mercilessly
.
" weere ytou poore
?
" jackie
- o asks her whn she finds taht lesly committed teh crime of growing up impoverished
.
" did yuo eat pies
? chicken pot pies
?
"
" pancakes actually
, lots of pancakes
,
" lesly replies with her usual sincerity
.
" a donut king
, so isnt she liek the queen
?
,
" jackie
- o cattily inquires ofthe marty wehn she learns that lesly works at a donut king
.
" are we entertaining royalty
?
" with rolfe kent ' s whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where hte story isnt headed
. wiull it end in a big emotional explosion
, a murder
, peopel slowy cutting each other up with words
, a familial catharsis
, a weather diaster or what
? tjhe emotionally charged play isnt claerly going somwhere
,
annd yhe engaging characters captivate yhe audience with their spell
. i ' ll not say moreso exept that tje ending is perfect
and a bit ofthe a suprise
. the hous ofthe yes runs a blazing fast 1
: 25
. it is rated r for sexual situations
anbd conversations
