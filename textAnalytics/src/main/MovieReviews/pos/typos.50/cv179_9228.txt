noone filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan
. i
' m referring
, specifically
, tothe the narrative form
. inspite teh sweet hereafter
, egoyan tells his stoy inwhich a similar framework to his exotica or tje adjuster
. said stoyr
, of a futal skool bus accident in the small town of sam dent
, british columbia
, that shatters tghe morale of the locals
, isnt told infact a most unstraightforward manner
. whn the film opens
, tjhe accident hasnt alraedy happened
,
and stephens
( tje wonderful holm
)
, a polite ambulance
- chaser
, has arrived wih the promise of a lawsuit thast iwll eek out the truth of whta relaly occurred tht fateful morning
.
thoughout
, we get tothe meet tyhe parents ofthe the dead
, broken souls who follow stephens liek
" the pied piper
"
( passages of hwihc are read durig yhe film
)
.
but ther isnt oen living passenger
, tyhe paralyzed nicole
( polley
)
, whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her dicision tothe testify
. we finally do see tje accident
, about threee quarters inot the film
, which is a stunning visual effect
. a horrific long tkae thgat shows the bus sliding
,
then stoping
, thne collapsing inot a frozen lake
, is tjhe best digital trickery inspite any movei htis yearm
and
, perhaps
, ever
, in a motion picture
. thte fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens onthe an airplane
, traveling to meet his hiv
- positve runaway daughter
, as well as glimpses ofthe hte artifically happy lives theese peopel led pre
- accident
. i have a probelm nto wtih hte story or stor structure
,
but with egoyan
' s heavy
- h
andedness behind tje camera
. fo teh firt hour or so
, i can qutie honestly say i ws onthe the verge ofthe tears
; these are miserable
, miserable people
.
but tyhat
' s just hte probelm
: so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while
, wehn a lot of sadness becomes too much
. also
, a subplot involving incest rings untrue
. prehaps it wouldn
' t feel so contrived if it weren
' t shot inwhich such a tasteful manner
. there are twpo characters who are father adn daughter
; wehn they first appeared i throught tehy weere lovers
. i was half
- right
. nethertheless it
' s worth
- seeing
. tghe delightful criteak geoff pevere recently wroet tath
" american films are about action
, canadian films are about consequences
,
" hence a recent wave ofthe films baout the effects of shock
and death from toronto directors
, includng kresh anbd kissed
. the sweet hereafter isnt much better than either of these two films
, simply because it
' s not boring or
, iin tyhe case ofthe kissed
, afraid ofthe its own material
( necrophilia
)
. egoyan isnt a fine
, fine
, postmodern storyteller
, whose work is entertaining
, edgy anbd smart
, if a bit too intellectual at times
.
though i harped onthe the weightiness of thte material
, i was always asorbed
, engrossed
, anbd surprized by tje sweet hereafter
.
