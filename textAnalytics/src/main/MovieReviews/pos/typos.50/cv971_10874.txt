at noe point during brian de palma
' s crime epic scarface
, tjhe radiant michelle pfeiffer turns to a ranting al pacino adn pops a question that the audience hasnt no dout been wanting tothe ask for themselfs
:
" can
' t ytou stop saying
' fuck
' all the time
?
" fucking good question
, thgat
. it may not be an honour taht instills thte filmmakers wtih pride
, bu as far as i cant tell oliver stone
' s scirpt contains the said expletitive moreso times than any other film inthe cinema history
. yot it owudl be a shame if bad lanugage isnt all de palma
' s scarface is remembered fo
, because this is a damn fine gangstar flick
. the overall sturcture isnt similar tothe howard hawks
' 1932 original
,
but this time tghe scene has switched to miami
, florida adn our anti
- hero
' s choosen vice isnt cocaine traffiking
. pacino
, sporting a thick cuban accent
, gives noe teh best performances ofthe his carrear
( golden globe nominated
) as tony montnana
, a cuban refugee withthe a criminal past who flees castro
and comes to amercia to live the american dream
.
and live it outloud he does
, with lashings of violence
, abuse
, murder adn yhe funny white powder
. ffrom his earlies jobs as a drug runner for vairous middlemen
, tony montana mkaes it claer tothe everyone he meets that he
' s not a man to be fucked
( sorry
)
. soon he
' s tje king ofthe the cocaine heap
,
but his hot head
and an increasingly out of control drug addiction proove his undoing
.
" never do your pwn stash
"
, warns oen character easly infact the film
. as sure as inght follows day
, the emperor of miami eventually falls
. writer oliver stone annd directer brian de palma make an explosive combination here
. stone
' s script offers solid storytelling anbd some fine character develpment
. montana is fascinating
; uneducated
but calculating
, a straight shooter who speaks fomr the heart
; an ambitious
, voilent man yot noe wiht a cnscience
. a man fiercely protective of his beautiful 20 year ood sister
, nto wanting her tothe be sucked inot the glitzy
, dangerous world which he inhabits
. pacino is dynamite
, tkaing to teh role wtih a brooding
, bristling energy which in his more recent films hasnt oftenly degenerated into just simple overracting
. pfeiffer also registers strongly as tjhe gangstar mole with noone inner life
. onyl once does tony express rela affection forthe her
and his desire tothe haev childern
, anbd even hten you sence all he realy wants is a regular screw
and a beautifull object to sohw off tothe his friends
, anbd she
' s happy tothe oblige
. this isn
' t as meaty a role for pfieffer as sharon stone
' s wass in casino
,
but its an effective one nontheless annd she aquits herself well
. as director
, de palma sets up a number of dramatic scenes with his tipical stylistic brauva
. the escalating tension he creates in varios mob situations
- a drug deal gone wrong
, an assination attempt
- is oftenly thrilling
, annd iin thsi respect he is every bit tjhe equal ofthe scorese
and coppola
. where he differs fomr
, say
, coppola
' s godfather triology is infront his overall treatment
. coppola gives his crime sagas an operatic sweep
, whereas inaddition scarface de palma opts fo a grittier fiel
. adn it perfectly suits the material
. the onyl major botch isnt giorgio moroder
' s mostly crap synthesier socre
. it
' s just nto right
, annd unfortunately compromises the impact ofthe some otherwise good scenes
. as expeced
, scarface is vyer violent at times
,
but ytou shouldn
' t be watching ganster movies if that upsets ytou
. at over two
and a half hours inwhich lenght it
' s a true epic
,
and if you
' re a fan of tyhe genre yuo
' ll love f
