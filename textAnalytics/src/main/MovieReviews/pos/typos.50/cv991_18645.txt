i don
' t box with kid gloves
. i don
' t play nice
, i
' m not a nice guy
,
and i never
, ever
, go easy onthe a film
. i consdider it tothe be a breech ofthe some sort of code ofthe ethics for a movei criteak
.
however
, i do some favors
,
and theese often cmo inaddition tje form ofthe points thgat i h
and tothe certain groups due tothe the artistic bravery
. rigormortis
, yhe prodcution company thgat has been my prime exmaple of how money doesnt not ened tothe motivate filmmaking
, gets several of these points each time
. i still
, howver
, will not go easy onthe them
. they recently sent me a vhs copy ofthe theri down wtih amercia trilogy
( which beigns
, qutie wittily
, wih a disclaimer thgat they are nto trying to undermine amercia withthe the mkaing of this film
.
) anbd i decided tothe spend an hour ofthe my day watching it
. iin the famouse lines ofthe many martyrs
, i have no regrets
. well
, i dont hve some regrets
, bu tath isnt nto the point inthe yhe previous sentence
. the point ofthe it ws thta down wtih america wass a film that
, from a critical st
andpoint
, doed nto entirely disappoint me
. sure
, tyhe risky uise of vhs instead ofthe super 8mm or 16mm wass a pain
, anbd the natural light was one of the most annoying thnigs about publich access films
,
but thge movie itself ws fairly enjoyable
. down witht america concerns a government agent
, needless murder
,
and a book containing everyting from the unabomber
' s manifesto tothe the 1995 aple coputer profit report
. liuke the previous films of rigormortis thgat i have reviewed
, it displays an off
- kilter humor adn itnelligence
? it succeeds inwhich makeing me laff where countless studio films fail
. the best way tothe see this film owudl be as a parody of tjhe countless conspiracy films that we haev been drowned inspite usance the paranoia of the 80s
. a dying movment ffrom the day they started
, theese paranoid
` thrillers
' hadnt tyhe govornment always covering up something
and had the smae favorite word
:
` roswell
.
' infact down with amercia
, hte line
` roswell
' is highly absent
. with an baout ten minute runnung tyme
, down wtih amercia effortlessly sidesteps every clich
? that teh conspiracy films fell into
, mkaes jokes at them at hte smae timne
,
and provides us whith funny
and memorable characters
. again
, i hvea seen movies thyat have gone onthe two hours with charactors i couldn
' t care less baout
. the film
, as previously stated
, concerns a federal agent
( peter roach
)
, an obssessed librarean
( meri stevens
)
, a mystery man
( joe kaczkowski
)
, anbd two people obssessed withthe silence inthe the library
( robb sherman
, kevin flowers
)
. yhe plot
: a book containing hte secrets ofthe all anarchists isnt hidden in
? a publich library where it can be viewed by all
. from ther we go inot a delightful parody
. yhe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth
, tje librarian goes on a diatribe about thge sanctity of books
. we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes tht are performes much too well considering the lack ofthe coaching of thge cast
.
al
thought the actors annd actresses are inwhich small roles anbd give a whole newyorker meaninng tothe
` no
- name
'
, it ends uv bieng the no
- name peopel who dont a ogod job
, delivering better performances as comic villains thna half the crap thyat hollywood turns outloud
. fo once
, i don
' t haev a url taht i konw offh
and tothe give you as tothe where to locate the film online
. i can onyl say that you should fidn my previvous reviews ofthe l
' auto annd les x
- files adn look uv tjhe rigormortis productions site in
and ofthe itself
. it
' s almost as much funn as tje film
.
