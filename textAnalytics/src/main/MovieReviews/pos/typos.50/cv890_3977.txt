. watch out forthe tje launching sequence
, it is simpley noe of the most breathtaking scenes of hte film
. a bad point
though
: apollo 13 features much technical jargon adn many physics concepts in its script
. thsoe who consdider themselves
` scientifically illiterate

anding wqat caused this
and what caused thgat durring thte course ofthe teh show
. htis is howver
, just a minor point
, just forget all those technical bullshit anbd immerse yourselves into hte drama adn suspense throughtout the film
