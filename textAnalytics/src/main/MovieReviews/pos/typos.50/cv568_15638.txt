" is one ofthe thsoe small
, deliberately pased
,
but charming foreign films inspite whlch not much happens plot wise
,
bu a lot happens tothe yhe charactors emotionally

" pauline at the beach
,
" isnt nto a film in which big dramtic thigns occur
,
anbd htere is not a clera
- cut
, tidy conclusion to hte story
. instade
, it is a picture tyhat simply observes its charachters inwhich eveyr day life
,
annd thge surprises come from littel carachter details
. tjhe film isnt quite talky
and slow moving
,
anbd so it is preety safe tothe sday it isn ' t for those who are onyl a fan of acation movies
,
but isnt a treat forthe those viewers who oftenly liuke tothe venture outside ofthe the big
- budget genre
and see a ogod art film
. thsi is tje first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer
( 1969 ' s
" my night at mauds

"
and 1971 ' s
" claire ' s knee
"
) that i have seen
,
but his direction is assured
adn intteligent
, as is thge screenplay
, which he aslo wroet
.
" pauline at the beach
,
" is a film worth seing
.
