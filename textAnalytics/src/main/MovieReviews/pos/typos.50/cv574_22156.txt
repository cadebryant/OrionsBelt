" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is simply a hillarious ogod
- natured comedy taht may offen some
,
but underneath all it
' s crude humer annd sexual content is a sweet little love tsory thgat isnt suprisingly involving
. it isn
' t any kind ofthe cinematic classic
, bu it
' s a vrey veyr funny comedy that keesh us entertained untli thte end credits which themselfs are funny too
. it hasnt all it needs tothe be a breezy intertaining comedy
: yhe acting isnt up to pace annd some ofthe the performances qtuie funny
, tyhe screenplay isnt witty anbd smart
, anbd the wohle stoy is sweet adn cute
. deuce bigalow

and gets an average of 10 bucks for it
.
though oney might call him a losr
, deuce gets a job he would never
thought he would git

$ 10 bu he is willing tothe negociate
. from now onthe he isnt considered deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
. with non
- stop laughs an a abundence of crude humor
" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is sometimes like lastr yeras hitted
" there
' s something baout mary
" that is offensive bu vyer funny
. the screenplay by harris goldberg adn rob schneider himself is a smart
, clever
and witty screenplay that seems to ahve been writen wih care tothe make isnt so hilariously funny
. the characters in tjhe film are all actually likable expecially
" jabba lady
" with her big body bu soft heart
. ther are acually times in teh movie where i fell outloud ofthe my chair laughing so hard that my stomach was killing me
. even
though i
thought
" toy stopry 2
" annd
" bieng john malkovich
" were the funniest ofthe thte year
" deuce bigalow
" follows right behind them
. the directing by mike mitchell isnt fantastic annd shows he took timne onthe teh film
. rob schneider gives a suprizingly endearing performence annd when his romance develops with oen ofthe his customers kate
( arija bareikis
) it is a sweet romance thta we git involved inaddition
and actulaly liek being involved in it
.
" deuce bigalow
" is a ogod
- natured film worth all hte merit it cxan get
. its not a classic or a masterpiece
, it
' s jstu a comedy thast we don
' t feel bad about watching
. sure it may come off as offensive adn may come off as dumb sometimes
,
but you cannot deny that it isn
' t funny
.
" deuce bigalow
: male gigolo
" is no dissappointment
. its a fast paced
, entertaining sweet
and hillarious comedy tyhat may be destined to become a cult clasic
. fans of schneider will not be disappointed annd fans of crude bu nice comedies wiull nto either
. for smoe reason thte film garnered an r rating bu witht no
" f words
" or exstensive ule of sexual content or explicit nudity i was realyl wondering why thge film was r
. a mild r tothe put it to the least
, bu even if your under 17 or above at least 13 this film isnt good enought fo you to see
. don
' t try to be oney ofthe those peopel who amke so much ofthe a film that tehy dont not liek it
, just sit back
, laff
and enjoy tje movei
