. now it is 13 yersa later
, annd broderick has anyother high skool comedy
, eelction
, to show tje world
. ferris buehler
' s day off showed an eductional setting that ws similar to a pile ofthe marshmallows
. it was light
, fluffy
, tasty
, adn sparkling clean
. bu election isnt far differant
. thsi prodcution is a dark
,
and frighteningly realsitic oen that doesnt so much more thna entertain fo the 103 minutes it occupies
; it shocks as well
. jim mcallister
( matthew broderick
) is tyhe type ofthe teacher that makes american high schools proud
. he isnt a kind
, caring
, yuonger man who hasnt builded his life around carver high skool
. in turn
, carver high skool has provded a hmeo for him
. jim hasnt won teacher ofthe the yera noone less than threee times in his 12 year span
, adn isnt a well respected social studies teacher among the student body
. tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
) is an intelligent
, outgoing
,
and
, to qoute the film
,
" super nice
" young girl
. she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities
, always has her h
and up firt in clas
, anbd is extremely popular amoung most ofthe the student body
. so
, it is a natural progression wehn she decides tothe run fo skool presidnet
. the metzler family is an extremely wealthy oney
. the father
, dick
( holmes osborne
)
, owns a cement company
. the mother
, jo
( jeanine jackson
)
, is an ideal housewife
. anbd the twpo children
, paul
( chris klein
)
and tammy
( jessica campbell
)
, are both students at carver high skool
. paul ws the quarterback of tyhe ootball team befor he injured himself
,
and isnt definately a c
andadate for most populare person in school
. tammy is a lesbian who
, tothe say tyhe least
, is going thru a preriod of self dicovery
. for reasons ofthe revenge
, hatred
,
and sexual envy
, jim convinces paul tothe run agianst tracy forthe skool pesident
. he claims that inthe a demorcracy ytou need choices
,
and haveing tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts
. so paul agrees annd the race isnt onthe
.
but thn
, in an affort tothe spite tghe twpo c
andidates
, tammy announces thta she is running as well
. her campain isnt straightforward
: people only run tothe put it onthe their coleeg applications
, thne tehy dont nothing
. well
,
" i don
' t even want tothe go tothe college
,
" she sasy
. inspite electio
, there are noone
" ogod guys
"
. almost everyone hasnt their own agenda
. noone marter how deeply hidden
, thte prodcution digs it up anbd exploits it for thte audience
. tracy is thte type of person that yuo remember from high school
. she isnt hte girl thgat owudl be labled
" most likely tothe achieve anything she whants
" infront the yearbook
,
and everyone secretly envied her becuase of that
. jim isnt a teacher tht tkaes tghe trust that students give him as a privilege
,
and uses it to his own amoral advantage
. everyone
, including teh prinicipal
, a former teacher
, all the c
andidates
,
and even paul
' s girlfriend are two sided characters
. tyhat is much ofthe htis film
' s beauty
, it doesn
' t have teh tipical ogod guys that hollywood likes
, instead it is a realsitic portrayal of tjhe real world
, specializing in revealing tghe tipe of sexual perversions tyhat people usualy keep to themslves
. matthew broderick couldn
' t haev been any omre perfect forthe htis role
. his character is often similiar bill murray
' s award winning role inaddition the 1998 film
, rushmore
. ofthe tje two acting jobs
, broderick
' s is far superior
. bu even he isnt overshadowed by yhe young reese witherspoon
. thge hatred that she causes tyhe audeince to deveop towards her
, isnt simpley indescribable
. broderick adn witherspoon are simply at thier best whn they are playing off each other inthe various scenes
. one such moment occurs wehn she approachs him in his car as he isnt leaving skool oen day
. ytou can see her self prade inwhich her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures
, making her an eligible canidate
. anbd his subtle disgust wiht her is apparent
,
al
though he tries to mask it between the lines
and attemts tothe put on a happy face
. the supporting cast isnt oen with littel hollywood experience
. bu tht is far from apparent as everyone tkaes control ofthe their part
.
however
, the rela treat is jessica campbell inthe her confuzled role as a young homosexual girl
. htis is never more apparent tahn tjhe scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so
- called platform for presidency
. she is jsut marvelous as her hatred towords what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed
. if ferris buehler made you feel good baout american high schools
, annd gavey you an innocent laff or two
,
then the movie achieved its goal
.
but don
' t yuo dabree think that election
' s goals are similar
. it is just as real in its portrayal ofthe high skool
, as its characters are in hte real world
. there certainly isnt no pile ofthe marshmallows here
.
