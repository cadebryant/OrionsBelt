, poitier chase earch otehr around the world hte jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman when tghe soviet union imploded
, tghe western countrys lost their shatow
. with tjhe united states friendly with the russians
, we noone longer had an entity tothe blaim forthe the world
' s problems
. this showed up infront hollywood films as the communist governement was noone longer tje easy bad guy
. it
' s time to rejoice beacuse we
' ve found our new villain
. nowe it
' s noone longer tghe russina govornment who sends killers out into foriegn l
ands
, it
' s the russina
_ mafia
_
. a perfect solution
, it combines hte dread of organized crime
and tyhe still
- present uneasiness witht the fromer eastern block countries
. best of all
, the villains are still foreigners
: fear of the other always plays best
. so it is a crime lord inaddition moscow thgat sends legendary hitman the jackal
( bruce willis
) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure inaddition retailation fo the death ofthe his brother druing a nightclub raid
. the fbi is at a loss as to how tothe protect teh target ffrom somone tehy
' re nto sure even exists
. comming tothe thier rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen
( richard gere
) who is temporarily released from prision tothe assist fbi agent carter preston
( sidney poitier
)
and russion major valentina koslova
( diane venora
)
. mulqueen
' s ex
- girlfriend basque territorist isabella
( mathilda may
) is tghe only person who has seen the elusive jackal
.
( presumabely ther is an exclusive interational terrorist club somwhere where tyhe threee met
.
) teh film follows twpo paralel tracks as the jackal prepares forthe his
$ 70 milion hitted annd mulqueen attempts to locate him hwile preston mkaes sure that hte irishman doesn
' t slip awya
. crossing numberous borders anbd donning various disguises forthe both himselv adn his mini
- van
, the killer isnt always one step ahead of his pursuers
. bieng very loosely based onthe the same book the 1973 thriller
" the day of the jackal
"
, comparsion between tyhe twpo films isnt inevitable
. htere isnt no doubt tyhat the original is the better movie
, palying the story for suspense rather tahn the currrent acation
/ adventure
. as a mistery
,
" teh jackal
" has enought holes infront it tothe ruin tje tale
, bu if ytou cxan accept it for what it is
, there
' s entertainment tothe be had
. holes
? let
' s see
? a pivotal clue forthe mulqueen is so obscure taht he must posess psychic powers to pik it uv
. for a 20
- year veteran that can comm
and tjhe big bucks
, the jackal is an incredibly poor shot
. the final scene between gere adn willis occurs in a loction that should be mobbed with police
, bu it
' s jsut the twpo ofthe them
. willis
' disguises usually look like bruce willis
and are jstu as intresting as val kilmer
' s infact
" teh saint
"
.
(
and lest you misunderst
and
, that
' s nto a compliment
.
) bu the threee stars are fun tothe watch
. it
' s ogod tothe see gere in something other thna a business suit
. willis has a mixed histroy inaddition picking projects
, bu his charachters are allways watchable
. poitier isnt by far hte superior actor
, bu hasnt limited screen tyme
. yhe problems inthe logic are flaws
,
but don
' t ruin hte expeience
. occasionlly there are movies that transcend theri blemishes
. this isnt oen ofthe them
