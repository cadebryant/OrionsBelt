deepo rising is noe ofthe
" thsoe
" movies
. thge kind ofthe movei whlch serves no purpose exept to entertain us
. it does not ask us tothe thiunk about imporatnt questions liuke life on other planets or thge possibility that there is noone god
.
.
. scre that
, it says boldly
, let
' s see some coputer generated monsters rip inot
, decapitate adn generaly cause irreparable booboos tothe a bunch of little known actors
. heh
! them wacky monsters
, gotta love
' em
. ofthe course
, since we can rent baout a thous
and b movies wiht yhe smae kind ofthe storey
, hollywood must give tht littel extra
" oumph
" tothe get people in theaters
. taht isnt where deepo rising fails
, which isnt a good hting
. confuzled
? let me explain
: dispite all them flashy effects adn big explosions
, deepo rising isnt still
, at heart
, a good
' ol b movei
. luckly
, it
' s a vyre good b movie
. the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie
' s bread
and
butter
. therfore
, thigns thast woudl destroy a serious movei actually halp us haev a good time while watching a movei of lower calibre
. of course we nkwo there
' s a big slimy creature behind thast doorjam
, thyat oney person iwll w
ander off to be picked off by said monster adn we always konw which persons or person wiull make it out alive
. we just don
' t know when or how horrible it iwll be
. i went to see deepo rising with my expections low
and my tolerance for bad dialogue high
. imagin my surprise wehn i discover that deepo rising isnt actually
, well
, pretty darn funny at times
. a funny b movei
? well
, that
' s newyorker
. these ficks are not suppoed to amking us laugh
.
( except for a fewd unintended laughs once a hwile
.
) anbd before ytou nkwo it
, treat williams
, wes studi adn famke jansen apearing onthe teh big screen
. hey
! i know them guys
(
and gal
) from a couple of otehr movies
. kool
. familiar faces
. so far so good
. our man treat isnt thge hero
, he
' ll live
. wes isnt a staple of b movies
, he isnt thte token victum
. we konw he
' ll buy the farm bu he will take a few creeps wiht him on yhe way out
. famke is thte babe
,
' nuff said
. there is aslo a guy wiht glasses
( the guy with glasses alwasy dies
) a balck person
( b movei buffs know thta the balck guy always dies
, never fails
) anbd a vrey funny
, nerdy guy
.
( ah
! comic relief
. how can we possably explain hvaing to kill him
.
.
. let him live
.
) aftter tje frist fifteen minutes i felt right at hmeo
. i know who to root for annd who i need to boo too
and a gum tothe chew
.
( please kill me
.
) suffice it to say that for yhe next hour
and a half i jumped outloud of my seat a few times
, went
" ewwww
" baout a dozen times annd nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions
and firepower our heroes were packing
. i
' m a man
, we nottice theese things
. all in all
, i
' d recommend deepo rising if you are looking forthe a ogod time
and care to leave your brain at tjhe doorjam
.
.
. bu bring your sence ofthe humer
and excitement inaddition wih you
. the acting isnt decent
, tjhe effects top rate
. how tothe best discribe it
? put toghether the jet ski scene ffrom hard rain
, the bug attacks from starship troopers
, a cuple ofthe james bond liuke stunts
and all thsoe scenes ffrom friday the thirteenth annd freddy where yuo keep screaming
" don
' t go htere
, he
' s behind you
"
and ytou end uv witht deep rising
. for creepy crawly goodness
, tight t
- shirts
, major firepower anbd thge ened tothe go to the bathroom eveyr fifteen minutes ffrom seing all that water
.
