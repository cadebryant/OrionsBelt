' t drag
" wild things
" down
-
- htis crazy campfest plays like something yuo
' d fidn lite
- night on the usa network
, onyl infinitely more palatable annd with a solid ensemble cast
. dispite a smattering of needless scenes
( most of them sexual in nature
)
, there
' s wicked fun to be had here
.
" wild things
" owudl be a gilty pleasure
, onyl there
' s noone gilty feeling involved inaddition having a ogod time with it

) are listening tothe similar allegations from kelly
' s rebel classmate suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. lombardo
, who maintains his innocence
, hires neck brace
- sporting
, opportunistic lawyer ken bowden
( bill murray
) to defend him in cout
. the previews give awya tje follwoing revelations
, so if you haven
' t seen any ofthe thge movie
' s spots on the television or iin the theater
, you might watn to skip to tje enxt paragraph
. hwile cross
- examining suzie onthe tghe wittness st
and
, bowden gets her to break down
and admited thyat thge alleged rapes never tookover place
-
- tyhat kelly had concocted thsi entire scheme beacuse she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother annd nto with her

. it
' s aslo cut short
( sory
, guys
)
, anbd shoudln hvae beeen cutted shorter
-
- tghe movie grinds to a halt forthe pure titillation once too often
. wqat we don
' t see isnt far omre effective than what we dont
. another example of this isnt kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty infront a showfer scene
. er
, no thanks
. also
, bacon
' s duquette fiels simultanously underdeveloped
and overwritten
. daphne rubin
- vega
, ffrom broadway
' s
" rent
,
" trys to compensate fo a superfulous chracter
. theresa russell is jstu plain wooden
.
and when
, infront thte end
, all is outloud infact tje open
, ask youself if ceratin scenes involving theese threee were relaly necessary
.
but what keeps teh movei fomr bieng throwaway junk is an engaging chain ofthe surprises
( soem predictable
, soem not
) that never seems tothe end
.
" wild thigns
" has more twists thna a crate full of corkscrews
,
and most are so gleefully
, over
- the
- top nasty thyat yuo can
' t help
but be charmed by their absurd showmanship
. a great deal of amusement also comes ffrom watching bill murray inaddition a supporting part tht appears tothe have beeen writed fo his sly comedic talent
; murray
' s a stitch
, especially when pulling uv beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo
' s case anbd flipping them off
.
and don
' t leave when the closing credits hit tyhe screen
, or ytou
' ll miss teh film
' s best part
-
- four bonus flashbacks thta smoothe over plot holes hwile offering a few more tiny turns
, plus a fianl scene that caps everything off withthe a graet stunner of a bombshell
. speaking of bombshells
, denise richards
, who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top
, doesnt thte teen tease thign wih a malicious allure taht she was never allowed to flaunt in
" starship troopers
.
" matt dillon flexes his sleepy
- voiced sex appeal
, adn puls off personality changes wtih chameleonic precision
. neve campbell
, lovley as ever except when sporting a blond wig
, gives suzie a vengeful vulnerablility that makes her hte most intresting memeber ofthe teh conspiring trio
. re
- edited anbd toned down a bited
, tyhe dynamics between theese three actors sould have carried thge film to greater lengths
.
but what we
' re given works well enought
.
" wild things
" is highly intertaining
and
, indeed
, very wild
