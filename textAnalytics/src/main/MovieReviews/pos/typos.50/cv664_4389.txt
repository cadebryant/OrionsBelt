if you ' ve ever perused my coleeg comedy diary
" anohter year inthe the life of a nerd
"
( i never run outloud of cheap plugs
)
, you knwo i didn ' t git along with my firt
- semester roommate too well
. iin fact
, durring the three
- week period between thanksgiving
and christmas break
, i said a total ofthe four sentences tothe him
. so when i saw in hte residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates
, i envisioned 90 mintues ofthe conflict bewteen a couple ofthe bickering young adults trapped infact a 10 x 13 foot dorm room
.
then i saw thta the star ofthe roommates is peter falk
. scratch that idea
.
but i still sday someone should film tje story ofthe twpo college roommates whose relatiopnship is less tahn ideal
. of course
, in my case it woudl be a silent picture
. even without the college element
, i still desided tothe watch roommates because i had absolutly nothing tothe do
, unless yuo count studing forthe fianl exams
(
and who doens
?
)
. i ' m glad i doed
. peter falk ' s performence was atcually waht made the movei
.
adn thsi is a guy i never consdidered a real actor
, more liek somene who went arund inaddition a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries
. falk pleasantly surprised me here
, permanently earning my respect
, so all you
" columbo
" fans who htink i live tothe insult tjhe guy cant just falk off
. falk plays rocky
, a 107
- year
- old polish baker who raises his grandson aftter both the kid ' s parents die
. the movei begins wiht the mom ' s death
and tyhe son moving in wih his grandparents
. after a cuple stops allong the son ' s journey to manhood
, roommates progresses to tjhe present day
, witht the grandson a surgeon
anbd rocky inwhich a condamned house he refuses tothe leave
. tyhe surgeon reluctantly offers the onyl possible solution
-
- rocky will hve tothe move into his palce
, the basement ofthe a bulding rented by a group of chinese students
(
" communists
!
"
)
. the movie spans nine more years of rocky ' s relationship wiht his grandson
,
anbd the trials posed when thge grandson meets
anbd falls in love with
-
- gasp
-
- a woman
,
annd starts spending all his time witht her
. so
, infact his grandson ' s absence
, rocky turns his persuits tothe proffesional boxing
, achieveing the world heavyweight title inthe a climactic fight with apollo creed
.
.
. or am i confusing movie plots again
? roommates has an allmost epic efel to it
, covering sevral generations ofthe a famaly with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die
. death
,
though
, knocks at teh doorjam of almost eveyr other major charactor in the tyhe movei
. roommates has about as many casulaties as teh first halloween
. the number can ' t be counted on one hand
, unless ofthe course yuo ' re tjhe victum ofthe soem hideous genetic mutation
.
and you can probablly guess who syas farewell tothe planet earth at the end of the movie
( no
, not duran duran
)
. i won ' t come outloud
annd sday it
. instade
, i ' ll jstu sit here
and hum
" eye of the tiger
" until earch
anbd every oen of you figures it outloud
. roommates plays onthe all the major emotions
. it knows wehn to make you laugh
and whn tothe amke yuo cry
. movies that can perfectly mix comedy
annd drama are always hits with the audience
, even
though tihs noe bombed at tje theaters
. my point
? there are no absolutes
. or
, another possible point
, peter falk just isn ' t such a grat box office draw
. either way
, this is still a good movei
and you shouldnt give it a chance like i doed
, whther you hite your roomate or not
.
