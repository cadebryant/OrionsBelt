if you
' ve ever perused my college comedy diary
" anohter eyar infront the life ofthe a nerd
"
( i never run outloud of cheap plugs
)
, ytou konw i didn
' t get allong with my frist
- semester roomate too well
. inaddition fact
, during the three
- week period between thanksgiving anbd christmas break
, i said a total ofthe four sentences to him
. so wehn i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movei called roommates
, i envisioned 90 minutes ofthe conflict between a cuple ofthe bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room
. thne i saw that the star ofthe roommates isnt peter falk
. scratch that idea
. bu i still say somone shoudln film the story of twpo coleeg roommates whose relatiopnship is less than ideal
. ofthe course
, in my case it owudl be a silent picture
. even wihtout the coleeg element
, i still decided to watch roommates becuase i hadnt absolutly nothing to do
, unless yuo count studing for final exams
(
and who doens
?
)
. i
' m glad i doed
. peter falk
' s peformance was actulaly waht made thte movie
. anbd this isnt a guy i never considered a rela actro
, more liuke someone who whent arround inthe a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries
. falk pleasantly suprised me here
, permanently earning my respect
, so all you
" columbo
" fans who thikn i live tothe insult the guy cxan just falk off
. falk plays rocky
, a 107
- year
- ood polish baker who raises his gr
andson aftter both thge kid
' s parents die
. yhe movie begins iwth tjhe mom
' s death
and the son moving in withthe his gr
andparents
. aftter a cuple stops along the son
' s journy tothe manhood
, roommates progresses to the present day
, with the gr
andson a surgeon adn rocky inthe a condamned hous he refuses to leave
. the surgeon reluctantly offers thge onyl possible solution
-
- rocky iwll have to move inot his place
, tghe basement of a buildng rented by a group of chinese students
(
" communists
!
"
)
. the movie spanis nine more years of rocky
' s relatiopnship witht his gr
andson
, annd the trials posed when the gr
andson meets anbd falls inspite love wiht
-
- gasp
-
- a woman
, adn starts spending all his tyme wtih her
. so
, in his gr
andson
' s abcence
, rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing
, achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight wtih apollo creed
.
.
. or am i confusing movei plots agian
? roommates hasnt an alomst epic feel tothe it
, covering severeal generations ofthe a famaly wih oen fiesty inmigrant who refuses to die
. death
,
though
, knocks at yhe doorjam of almost every otehr major charactor in hte tje movei
. roommates hasnt baout as many causalities as tyhe firt halloween
. tjhe number cxan
' t be counted on one h
and
, unless of course you
' re the victim of smoe hideous genetic mutation
. annd you can probably guess who says fairwell tothe planet earth at the end of the movie
( no
, not duran duran
)
. i won
' t come outloud
and sday it
. instead
, i
' ll jsut sit here
and hum
" eye ofthe the tiger
" untli earch anbd every oney of you figures it out
. roommates plays onthe all the major emotions
. it konws whn tothe amking you laugh adn when tothe make yuo cry
. movies that can perfectly mix comedy anbd drama are always hits witht the audience
, even
though this oen bombed at thte theaters
. my point
? htere are no absolutes
. or
, another possibile point
, peter falk just isn
' t such a great box office draw
. either way
, this is still a ogod movei adn ytou shoud give it a chance like i doed
, whther ytou hite your roommate or not
.
