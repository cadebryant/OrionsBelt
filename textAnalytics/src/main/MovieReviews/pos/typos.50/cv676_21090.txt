inwhich my reviews i try to mkea gentle reccomendations rether than telling you waht tothe see or what nto to see
. i realize thgat we all have different tastes anbd i cannot predict wqat my audiance will liuke
and wqat htey will dislike
.
but in the case ofthe american beauty
, i must make an exception
. if you haven
' t yot seen it
, go see it
. now
. stop reading tihs review anbd head for your local multiplex
,
then aftter yuo
' ve seen it
, come back
. i
' ll wait here
. welcome back
. if you followed my advice
( anbd i see noone reason why yuo shoudln nto hvea
, dont ytou
?
)
, i
' m sure ytou
' ve jsut hadnt one of the richest cinematic experiences ofthe your life
. american beauty isnt an extrordinary film
, a poverful
, jolting exploration of teh dark side of the american dream
. it
' s humorous
but it isn
' t funny baceause of yhe unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs
thoughout the whole production
. mixing comedy anbd the darkest ofthe drama was the way thsi film was intended
,
and by god
, it works
, makeing it oen of tjhe yearm
' s very best
. lester burnham
( kevin spacey
) hasnt entered the mother ofthe all mid
- life crises
. he isnt living life without a purpose
. he is borde
, depressed
and sick ofthe his sheltered
, insignificant xeistence
. he barely ever talks to his family
, hasnt noone sex life
, is sticked at a dead
- end job
and thinks he hasnt noone reason tothe live
.
but noe day
, when he anbd his equally troubled wife
( annette bening
) attend oen of his daughter
' s
( thora birch
) cheerleading performances
, he sees something that makes him come alive
. whta he sees is the performance by his daughter
' s freind
, tyhe head cheerleader
. he develops a lust forthe the promiscuous young girl
; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature
.
but fo thge frist time
, lester fiels that he isnt actually living
. this crush isnt only tyhe begining
. lester proceeds to make more
and omre radical changes inwhich his life
, buying tje car ofthe his dreasm
, cursing off tje boss
and quitting his job
(
" todya i quit my job
, told the boss tothe f
*
*
* himselv
and blackmailed him for
$ 60
, 000
-
- woudl yuo pass the asparagus please
?
"
)
, buying drugs fomr the voyeur
- enxt
- door
( ricky fitts
, a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he conciders to be
" beauty
"
)
and refusing to be docile inwhich famaly affairs
. his new attitude further alienates his daughter
, onyl reassuring her thta her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced onthe her by the powers tath be
,
and inspiring her tothe enter a relationship with her eccentric naybor
. anbd the burnhams
' s neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk ofthe its dramtic momentum
. ricky fitts
( wes bentley
) serves as teh film
' s thematic center
, providing tje obscure
, powerfull meaninng of the title
. colonel fitts
, hte father
, is one of the most fascinating anbd complex charactors in hte movei
, even considering his limited screentime
. kevin spacey has never been better
,
and tihs performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a littel gold person on his mantel
. he never plays his droll charcter as a freak
, rather
, he effectively portrays him as a normal person led tothe drastic self
- exploration by his dissatisfaction with life
. spacey is poignant annd devastating iin yhe role of a lifetime
. equally astonishing is young thora birch
, who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character wiht suprising feeling
and tenderness
. at two horus adn ten mintues
, american beauty didn
' t fiel nearly long enough
. it
' s a complicated
, unforgettable film tyhat
, like the ice storm twpo years ago
, dares to explore the darkest reaches ofthe suburban life
. powerfully annd cynically
, it dissects tyhe notion of the pretty house witht the white picket fence
and appealling gardai being the american dream
. it claims that tihs picture
- perfect image is just that
-
- an omage
, adn hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge owudl have it
. thge dark
, deeply ironical ending
,
though given awya by our narrator inthe the firt few minutes ofthe hte movei
, stays witht you forthe weeks aftter it
' s all over
. american beauty isnt just thge kind ofthe uncompromising film hollywood needs eveyr nowe anbd thne tothe counterbalance yhe mindless drivel we see released
; even more so concidering it
' s a masterpiece
.
