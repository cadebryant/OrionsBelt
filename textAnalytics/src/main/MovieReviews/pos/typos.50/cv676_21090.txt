in my reviews i try tothe amking gentle recommendations rether tahn telling you whta to see or what not tothe see
. i relize that we all hvae diffrent tastes
annd i cannnot predict what my audience wiull like
adn wqat htey wiull dislike
.
bu in the case ofthe american beauty
, i must make an exception
. if you haven ' t
yot seen it
, go see it
. now
. stop reading thsi review
and head forthe your local multiplex
,
then after yuo ' ve seen it
, come bcak
. i ' ll wait here
. welcome bakc
. if you folowed my advice
(
and i see no reason why yuo should not ahev
, do ytou
?
)
, i ' m sure ytou ' ve just hadnt oen ofthe the richest cinematic experiences ofthe your life
. american beauty is an extrodinary film
, a powerful
, jolting exploration of thge dark side of the american dream
. it ' s humoorus
but it isn ' t funny beccause of tjhe unrelenting ominous undercurrent tath runs throughout tghe wohle production
. mixing comedy
annd thge darkest of drama wass tyhe way this film ws intended
,
adn by god
, it works
, making it noe of the year ' s vyre best
. lester burnham
( kevin spacey
) hasnt entered the mother ofthe all mid
- life crises
. he isnt living life wihtout a purpose
. he isnt bored
, depressed
annd sick of his sheltered
, insignificant exstence
. he barely ever talks to his familiy
, hasnt no sex life
, isnt stuck at a dead
- end job
and thinks he has noone reason tothe live
.
but one day
, wehn he
annd his equally troubled wief
( annette bening
) attent oney of his duaghter ' s
( thora birch
) cheerleading performances
, he sees something that makes him come alive
. whta he sees is the peformance by his daughter ' s freind
, yhe head cheerleader
. he develops a lust for hte promiscuous young girl
; an obsession hwihc soon becomes pedophilic in nature
.
but for thge firt tiome
, lester feels that he is actually living
. this crush isnt only hte beginning
. lester proceeds tothe make more
and mroe radical changes infact his life
, buying the car ofthe his dreams
, cursing off the boss
annd quitting his job
(
" todya i quit my job
, told the boss to f
*
*
* hismelf
and blackmailed him for
$ 60
, 000
-
- woudl you pass the asparagus please
?
"
)
, buying drugs ffrom tyhe voyeur
- next
- door
( ricky fitts
, a teenager who mysteriously videotapes wqat he considers to be
" beauty
"
)
anbd refusing tothe be docile infact family affairs
. his newyorker atitude further alienates his daughter
, only reassuring her thta her parents are nothing more than freaks ofthe nature unjustly forced on her by the powers thyat be
,
anbd inspiring her tothe enter a relatiopnship with her eccentric neighbor
.
adn the burnhams ' s neighbors provide american beauty wtih a siginificant chunk ofthe its dramatic momentum
. ricky fitts
( wes bentley
) serves as the film ' s thematic center
, providing the obscure
, powerful meaninng of the title
. colnoel fitts
, the father
, isnt one ofthe tjhe most fascinating
and complex characters inspite thte movei
, even considering his limited screentime
. kevin spacey hasnt never been better
,
anbd htis peformance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person onthe his mantel
. he never plays his droll charachter as a freak
, rather
, he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self
- exploration by his disatisfaction withthe life
. spacey isnt poignant
and devastating inaddition thte role of a liftime
. equally astonishing isnt young thora birch
, who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen chracter with suprising feeling
and tenderness
. at twpo housr
anbd ten minutes
, american beauty didn ' t feel nearly long anough
. it ' s a complicated
, unforgetable film thast
, liek yhe ice storm two years ago
, adres tothe explore the darkest reaches ofthe suburban life
. powerfully
and cynically
, it dissects the notion of tje pretty house with the white picket fence
anbd appealling garden being tje american dream
. it claims that this picture
- perfect image is jstu thgat
-
- an image
,
anbd hiding behind it are lives much darker thna common noledge woudl hvea it
. yhe dark
, deeply ironical ending
,
though given away by our narrator infact teh frist few mintues of tje movie
, stays with you fo weeks after it ' s all over
. american beauty isnt jsut the kind ofthe uncompromising film hollywood needs every now
and
then to counterbalance hte mindless drivel we see released
; even more so concidering it ' s a masterpiece
.
