inwhich recent yersa
, harrison ford has beeen such a grav screen presence
, scowling through the likes of toom clancy ' s jack ryan sories
,
_ tyhe
_ fugitive
_
,
and lsat yearm ' s smash
_ air
_ force
_ oney
_
, thta one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had beeen completly drained fomr his system
. apparently
, it was jsut lieing dormant
. wtih ivan reitman ' s enjoyable romantic comedy
/ adventure
_ six
_ days
,
_ seven
_ nights
_
, the lovable scoundrel is back
, giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford isnt one of teh most enduring
anbd populare modern screen icons
. ford plays quinn harris
, a carefree
and slightly slobby
( endearingly so
) pilot in the tropics whose broken
- down plane crashes inspite a storm
, stranding him
annd his charter
, new york magasine editor robin monroe
( anne heche
)
, on a deserted island
. ofthe course
, tje sophisticated robin
and the salt
- of
- tghe
- earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down
,
and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged betwen the twpo from their firt meeting
. while some of the lines fall flat
, the formulaic motions wokr because of the unexpectedly electric chemestry beween ford
and heche
. both actors
, who have largely done serious works as of late
, seem liberated by the lack ofthe dramtic weight on theri shoulders
,
and tehy deliver thier zingers
, as weak as they sometimes are
, whith beguiling abandon
. naturally
, htere ' s nothing liuke a life
- threatning crisis to bring twpo peple together
,
adn quinn
adn robin ' s warmup to earch otehr is sped uv even futher by tje arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates
. granted
, smoe conflict needed to be introduced onthe yhe island
,
but this tacked
- on developemet from writter michael browning isnt a bited too obviously thrown infact for the purpose of adding gratuitous acation scenes
.
but the point is tothe git the two toghether
,
adn theri newfound affection causes complications for both
,
but mostly robin
, who came to tghe islands on a vacation with her fiance frank
( david schwimmer
)
, who frantically awaits her return onthe tyhe home island
. reitman
,
anbd ood
, reliable hand at breezy comedies
, keesh the pace brusk
anbd capably handles the mroe action
- oriented sequences
. his big acomplishment
,
however
, is bringing tjhe old
, smiling ford bcak
. as appealling
anbd carismatic as he always is
, ford hasn ' t been quite this charming
and affable iin years
; he ' s obviously haveing a blast
,
anbd the audiance cannot help
but hvea oen along with him
. holding her own isnt heche
, whose scrappy charater never becomes yhe screaming ninny she initialy promises to be
( as the plane goes down
, she frantically pops stres pills
)
. she cin tkae her lumps
, fysical
and otherwise
, jsut as well as quinn
, mkaing her a formidable foil
and ideal match
. formulaic
and light as a feather
,
_ six
_ days
,
_ seven
_ nights
_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer
" popcorn
" movei season ' s lack ofthe substance
. it ' s certainly fluff
,
bu it ' s unpretentious
, undemanding
,
anbd
-
- most importantly
-
- funn fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach
. pass the popcorn
