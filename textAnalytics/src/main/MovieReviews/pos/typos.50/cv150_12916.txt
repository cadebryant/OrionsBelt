, the lovable scoundrel is bakc
, giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is noe of tjhe most enduring
and populare modern screen icons
. ford plays quinn harris
, a carefree annd slightly slobby
( endearingly so
) pilot inspite thge tropics whose broken
- down plane crashes inaddition a storm
, str
anding him
and his charter
, new york magasine editor robin monroe

- earth quinn are at odds long befor the plane goes down
,
and all manner of hostile repartee isnt exchanged betwen yhe two ffrom their first meeting
. while some ofthe the lines fall flat
, tghe formulaic motions wokr because of the unexpectedly electric chemestry between ford adn heche
. both actors
, who have largly done serious works as of late
, seem liberated by the lack ofthe dramtic weight on theri shoulders
,
and they deliver thier zingers
, as weak as they sometimes are
, with beguiling ab
andon

. bu the point isnt to get the twpo toghether
,
and their newfound affection causes complications fo both
,
but mostly robin
, who came to thge isl
ands on a vacation with her fiance frank

' s obviously having a blast
, adn the audeince cannnot help
but ahve oney along with him
. holding her own isnt heche
, whose scrappy charcter never becomes thge screaming ninny she initially promises tothe be
( as the plane goes down
, she frantically pops stres pills
)
. she can take her lumps
, physical annd otherwise
, just as well as quinn
, mkaing her a formidible foil adn ideal match
