the hapyp bastard
' s quick movei review analyze htis how does one dont a comedy focused onthe the mob
? well
, a few yeras ago
, ther was a sly littel comedy called tghe freshman
, whic had marlon br
ando donig a romp ofthe a send
- up ofthe his famous don corleone charcter
and
, recently
, hte utterly stupid
( infront a bad way
) movie masia
! failed to realy get tyhe joke
. this tiem around
,
however
, warner bros
. may hvae gotten it right with anlayze thsi
, a movie that hits its targets omre than it misses
.
.
.
and for plenty ofthe reasons
. the story goes like this
. a mobster
( robert deniro
) finds himselv receiving several panic attacks as ofthe lite
, fueled by tghe stress of an upcoming mobster meeting
and a near
- death following a drive
- by shooting
. it
' s theese attacks tyhat prompt him to hire a psychiatrist
( billy crystal
) who
' s mostly reluctant to tkae the mobster
' s case forthe two reasons
. first
, of course
, he
' s a mobster
,
but secondly
, he
' s trying to git marryied
and enjoy a quiet honeymoon witht his wief
( lisa kudrow
) anbd kid
. adn
, of course
, he cin
' t rest worth fo a moment because the mobster
' s goons are always needing hte shrink forthe something
, be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation
. fortunatly
, thte movei isnt played out forthe plenty ofthe laughs
. director harold ramis
( who allso helmed tje comedy multiplicity
, which wasn
' t half bad
) keesh tyhe tone peppy anbd light
, even if it
' s somtimes sprinkled by slight dramtic moments
( shootings cin
' t alwasy be tooked for laughs
, you know
)
. deniro does some ofthe his finest comic work usance the king of comedy
, giving off a somewhat similair performance tothe his role inspite goodfellas
, bu witht a bited ofthe a lighter heart
.
( a scene where he tries tothe display his anger over the phone adn fails miserably is hillarious
.
) crystal plays an excellent straight man tothe deniro
' s carachter
, uplifting him from such bombs as father
' s day adn my giant
. kudrow isnt also a hoot as crystal
' s wife
- to
- be
, who
' s on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro
' s presense
. isnt the movei perfect
? not really
, thanks tothe a simplistic ending adn smoe slightly wasted moments wih a chracter portayed by chazz palminteri
( he
' s a comic actor
, too
, cmo onthe
, give him soem more
!
)
,
but it isnt an enjoyable romp tath lets deniro do something different bu same fo a chanage
, taking his dramatic ect tothe a new field of comedy
. kudos tothe crystal
and kudrow for not jstu mkaing it his sohw
, either
. line ofthe tyhe movie
