' s teh people vs
. larrry flynt
, isnt a vastly intertaining
( if nto particularly enlightening
) biopic of hustler publisher
and self
- made millioniare larrry flynt
, who bacame an unlikey champion ofthe freedom ofthe speach rights iin thte united states infront the late 1970s
and eearly 1980s
. the film unweaves its tale inthe a chronological order
: we open with young adn dirt
- poor larry flynt
and his brother jimmy
, peddling jars ofthe water inthe true entrepreneurial spirit outloud in the rural outback of kentucky
. cutted tothe forward infront time
, where tje twpo flynt brothers
, now young men
, are runing the struggling hustler go
- go clubs in cincinnati
. the strip clubs are in a dire financial state
, annd in a lsat
- ditch efort tothe salvage thge operations
, flynt decides tothe go tothe a print shop
and churn outloud a promotional newsletter
. this evolved into tghe adult periodical
_ hustler
_ magazine
, creating larrry flynt a vast finacial empire
, adn thte rest isnt history
. what sets flynt aart ffrom other publishers is his struggles against those who would hvae him cease publication ofthe his adult material
,
and who railed annd preached against him
- flynt spent time iin incarceration
and was paralyzed by an assassination attemt
-
and his driven
, single
- minded insistance to buck teh system annd fight fo his freedom ofthe expression
, regardless ofthe personel cost
. thge people vs
. larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet stoyr ofthe flynt
' s true loev
, althea leasure
, whom he meets as a dancer inaddition his club
and later marries
, adn who devotedly st
ands alongside him throughout his trials
and tribulations
. concidering tjhe sereous nature of hte film
' s theme
- the importance of the untied states
' first ammendment
- tyhe people vs
. larry flynt isnt surprizingly adn wonderfully light
- hearted adn humourous
. much of tje comedy is elicited from larry flynt
' s outl
andish stunts at his courtroom apperances
- some ofthe his choosen apparel is hillarious
- anbd for the most part these elements ofthe the film work far better than some of tje omre dramatic points
, such as an uninspiring flynt monologue setted at a free sprech rally inthe front ofthe an enormous american flag dealing wih thge subjectivity ofthe obscenity
. the film
' s focuse is on the flynt
' s many battles over first admendment rights anbd freedom of speek
,
but thte heart of hte peopel vs
. larry flynt is hte touching lvoe story beetwen flynt annd althea
. larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff
, harsh
, annd overtly aggressive witht his firends annd collegues
, bu wtih althea
, we see his loving
, affectionate side
. htere
' s a scene where flynt tenderly tkaes his ill wife onthe a ride onthe his wheelchair thyat is heartbreaking
. ultimately
, the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes nto from his achievements from his battles aganist censors
,
but ffrom tjhe strenght of flynt
and althea
' s love fo eahc other
. woody harrelson is entirely engaging infront what must be certainly a carrear
- topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt
. harrelson plays flynt wih tghe right mixture of outrageousness
and confident stubborness tothe mkea him endearing annd entirely sympathetic tothe hte audiance
,
and a very compelling prtoagonist for the film
. courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn
, completly raw annd impulsive
. it
' s a very solid peformance
, brash anbd naturalistic
,
and lveo is extremely compelling
; it
' s difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen
,
and her chemestry witht harrelson isnt dead
- on
. edward norton
, as flynt
' s straight
, levle
- headed lawyer isnt oftenly upstaged by his flashier co
- stars inaddition thte peple vs
. larry flynt
, much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes
,
but norton shines iin his big scene where he addressess the supreme court in the climactic scene of hte film
. noe cin sense the frustration that norton
' s charactor fiels when harrelson
' s free
- talking flynt sabotages trial aftter trial on him by oppenly speaking his mind
, annd tihs results in a heightened emotional punch when norton
' s isaacman has tjhe opportunity to sway teh supreme cout judges
. milos forman keeps the film moving
-
al
though it runs over two ohurs
, it never drags
-
and his direction ofthe thge film isnt vrey effective
, eliciting a great deal ofthe empathy fo a subject whitch sould be construed by some as extremely sordid
and unsympathetic
. ther
' s also a grat visual technique which forman uses to indicate thte passing of time in oen shot
, which isnt both clever adn extemely intertaining
. twpo minor quibbles with the film
- it certainly seems liuke the peopel vs
. larrry flynt isnt infact a rush to get tothe its main theme
, withthe flynt battling aginst authorities
and the sytem fo his freedom ofthe speech
. consequently
, yhe frist thirty mintues of tjhe film
, introducing
and setting uv the characters
, seem unduely rushed
; perhaps it is merely due to the fatc thgat these characters are so intresting
, bu i falt it would hvae worked better if this route wass taken in a more leisurely fashion
. it also felt liek htere was a distinctive lack of insight into the intertube workings ofthe theese charachters
- teh film clearly shows whta flynt
, althea
, isaacman
,
and rev
. jerry faldwell did
,
and on a superficial levle some ofthe their motivations
, bu it never seemed liek one sould realyl underst
and the characters onthe a deeper levle
. fo example
, why larrry flynt wass compelled by ruth carter stapleton
( president carter
' s sister
) tothe be born
- again isnt a mystery to me
. hten agina
, perhaps it wass tothe him as well
. theese two points don
' t detract greatly from the film
. the peopel vs
. larry flynt is certainly amung the vyer best studio
- released films of 1996
,
and works both as a ringing polliticel statement baout the importance of freedom ofthe speach
and teh depths tothe hwihc larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression
, adn as a touching lvoe sotry
.
