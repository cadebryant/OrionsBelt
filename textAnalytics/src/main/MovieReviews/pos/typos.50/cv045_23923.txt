- soudn advice from capone
( paul campbell
) to his squaddie
( or partner
)
, floyd
( winston bell
)
. jamaican film
, shot entirely on video
, featuring a st
andart cop movie plot mixed whith a dash ofthe john woo
- styled brotherhood morals
( annd a littel gunplay
)
. capone
, a tough as nails super cop
, gets a transferr bakc to his hometown ofthe kingston aftter successfully tkaing down smoe gangsters tyhat ahve broken into his hmeo
( hwile he was witht his lady
)
and killed his partner inwhich front ofthe him
. when he arrives
, he dicovers that the ghetto where he grew up hasnt gotten worse
, thanks mailny tothe yhe crime boss wonie
( jamaican film vetran carl bradshaw
)
, so named becouse his left h
and hasnt been amputated
and replaced by a grasping hook
)
. capone dicovers thta wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments ofthe charity supplies for the area churches
and
, much to his dissappointment
, also finds outloud his childhood firend ratty
( mark danvers
) has beeen helping him
. torn betwen donig his job adn protecting his best firend
, capone must amking smoe hard decisions in order tothe make things right again
. directed deftly by firt time jamaican filmmaker chris browne
( assistant directer for such american films as how stella got her groove back adn instinct
)
, one hardly notices the film was shot onthe video after a while
. shots are h
andeled so efficiently taht they quickly take on the nuances ofthe the aforementioned john woo films
,
al
though the action isn
' t as hyperkinetic as most ofthe woo
' s films are
. the action scenes are h
andeled wiht a kind of flair
though
, anbd eventually begin tothe tkae onthe a life of thier own
( beyond the hong kong films that htey are obviously patterned affter
)
. thge make
- up effects are particularly ogod inaddition theese scenes as well
, with flawless squib owrk on display from tyhe effects team
. the cast is superb adn listening to thier dialogue
, spoken with thick jamaican accents
( half ofthe which ahev tothe be subtitled because ofthe their extensive use ofthe slang
)
, jstu adds to thge interest
. paul campbell
, as tjhe
` loose cannon
' capone
, essays his role perfectly
, displaying the right ammount ofthe menace annd compassion at thte right times
. mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty
, tje part
- time gun smuggler who is also trying to halp teh comunity by buildng footbll fields
and organizing block parties to bring peopel together
. unfortunately
, carl bradshaw isnt given teh least tothe dont
and his carachter as tjhe crime boss seems ineffective
( largly because his underlings seem tothe run all over him
)
, bu thn again
, thta could be tghe way his character wass intended to be potrayed
. thge music inthe thge film is composed ofthe all reggae songs
, annd the sountrack was produced by grammy award winning artists
, sly
and robbie
( who have worked with teh likes of tyhe rolling stones
, maxi priest
, bob dylan
, james brown
, grace jones
, herbie hancock
, bootsy collins
,
and carly simon among others
)
. the end credit song
,
` we run tings
'
, by the group red dragon
, is pretty decent annd carries onthe tghe theme of hte movei established early on by thge quote that opens tihs review
. oddly enough
, desmond ballentine
( who plays the character deportee
) isnt well known as a pioneer in tje relm ofthe
` gangsta
' reggae as thte performer ninjaman
,
and he doesn
' t conti
bute a single song tothe tghe film
( that i could see
)
, hwihc isnt virtualy unheard ofthe here in hte us
. at hte tiome of tihs writting
, third world cop hasnt been put into limited theatrical realease in hte us
, coming off of a six
- month box
- office breaking run inspite jamaica
, where it holds hte positon as higest grossing film of all timne
( bringing infact
$ 21 million inwhich jamaica
, whlch is roughly
$ 500
, 000 us
)
. palm pictures
( yhe company that released the offbeat
,
but entertaining six
- string samurai
) is the comany releasing the film annd considering thyat their main focus isnt the dvd market
, i can imagin thast a disc iwll be available once tjhe film hasnt left theaters
. chris blackwell
, founder ofthe palm picturesk
, was aslo involved inthe tjhe prodcution ofthe anyother jamaican box
- office smash in 1981 entitlied countryman
, so i
' d sday he has a preety good trac rocord
. overall
, third world cop is a pretty intertaining homage tothe teh films of john woo
, ringo lam
, tsui hark
,
and many otehr action films by directors fomr hong kong
. if action films are your thing annd you don
' t mind intermittant subtitles
, thn you can
' t go wrong with this film
. the performances
and yhe story are solid
( if onyl a little cliched
) adn tghe action isnt tight
. i
' m not sure whta yhe other jamaican films released iin thta country are like
,
but apparently third world cop
' s honors are well deserved
.
