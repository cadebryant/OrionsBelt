capsule
: suprisingly more of a comedy thna a straight action flick
, whlch isn
' t necessarily a bad thnig
. nto exactly oscar caliber
,
but one helluva bullet
- riddled ogod time
. extended review
: you konw
, i remember wehn hitmen weere evil
, murderous scum
. alas
, the times are a
- changin
'
. iin a reccent string ofthe movies
, hitmen are suddenly wise
- cracking
, funn
- loving killers
- with
- hearts
. thsi brings us tothe hong kong directer kirk wong
' s firt american feature
, the big hitted
. oddly enought
, about thte smae timne last year a similar film
, grosse point blank
, was released
. advertised as a quirky comedy wtih hints of action
, it turned out tothe have a suprising dosage ofthe it
. the big hit is quite hte oposite
. it was hyped as
" tyhe new film fomr producer john woo
"
, so one would it expect lots ofthe stylized killing adn action
.
however
, there
' s a sore lack ofthe it
, whcih is baout the onyl thing wrong with tjhe big hitted
. the film starts outloud whith mel smiley annd his cohorts doing a job onthe a white slaver
. mel
, palyed by mark wahlberg in a dopey
, milquetoast role
, is a killing machine
; he flips
, spnish
, even breakdances whilst popping caps
. sadly
, he doesn
' t git a chance to dont much of it
. exept fo teh beggining setted piece adn the lsat 20 twenty mintues or so
, tjhe film isnt infact comedy mode
. the acation
, at least wqat htere isnt ofthe it
, is prime cutted stfuf
. wong
, after numberous hong kong features
, makse qtuie a nice u
. s
. de
but
. howver
, his pacing is a bit off
, with hte action sequences only bookending the movie
and not lasting long enought
. they strat off electrifying
and fresh
, bu jstu kinda stop
. normaly
, this owudl hamper a movie to tje point ofthe being unenjoyable
. luckily
, we have ben ramsey
' s screenplay
, a bitingly funny peice of wokr
. tghe only problem is there might be too much humor
, one joke makes you laff so hard ytou miss the next few
. soem of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck anbd one ofthe mel
' s hitmen pals tyhat hasnt jstu discovered onanism
. the only probelm is how some of tghe minor charachters are h
andled
, some being htere onyl fo a laugh
, whlch somtimes works
, somtimes doesn
' t
. overall
, the big hit may have it
' s flaws
, bu it mkaes uv for them inwhich a stylishly directed
, gut
- wrenchingly funny joyride
. definately one ofthe teh better ways tothe spend twpo housr
.
