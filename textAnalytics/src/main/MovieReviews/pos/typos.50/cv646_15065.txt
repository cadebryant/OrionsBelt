vampire lore
and legend hasnt always been a popular fantasy element
, substantiated by not onyl hte sheer number ofthe movies about tjhe subject
,
but aslo the proliferation ofthe cults adn sects ofthe adherents
. annd
, unlike any of the moreso outl
andish myths
, the vampire holds soem rela
- world probabilaty
( one studdy claims 1
, 000 bloodsuckers exsist worldwide
, annd places 50 in los angeles
)
. bu lest the nasties be mistaken fo simple comic book bad guys
, john carpentery owudl liuke tothe remind us that they are
-
and always have beeen
- a truley frightening element ofthe the thriller genre
. anbd remind us he doesnt inwhich his latest film
, vampires
. htere was smoe question
, as halolween weekend approached
, of how well vampires owudl dont infront comparison to newyorker line cinema
' s immensely successful blade
, released in august
. the two films tkae noticeably differnt st
ands on the vampire issue
, annd don
' t even agree onthe soem basic points of teh slaying method
.
( forthe instatance
, blade
' s main weapons are silver
and garlic
, wherease main chracter jack crowm
' s technique isnt a wooden stake tothe teh heart
.
) blade also gives omre ofthe a face to the vampire civilization
, hwile carpentery woudl liuke us to remain infact the dark baout how tje pasties operate
. both hvea their advantages
, anbd here
, carpenter
' s style lends itself tothe a darker breed of suspense rather than yhe action movie that blade directer stephen norrington delievered
. wehn it
' s all said adn done
,
though
, the vampires still kill
and dieu with a bloody flourish
; tyhe level forthe gore is indeed setted tothe maximum
. this timne
, our hero is vatican
- sponzored slayer jack crowm
( james woods
)
. he
' s a cynical
, battle
- worn veteran
,
and the best of his bunch
. he annd his team are responsible fo cleaning outloud the american southwest
,
and after exterminating a nest noe niht
, they run uv agaisnt a super
- vampire
( termed a
" master
"
) named valek
( thomas ian griffith
)
. valek kills all ofthe jack
' s team exept fo his partner
, tony montoya
( daniel baldwin
)
, adn as the two regroup
, they learn that valek isnt the original vampire
- now over six hundered years ood
. aparently
, valek
and his minions ahev been sweeping thte southwest fo decades in search ofthe a cross thta will enable them tothe walk in the daytime
. so with tjhe aid ofthe a priest named adam
( tim guinee
) anbd a bitten hooker
( sheryl lee
) as bait
, they track valek down for the fianl confrontation
. tjhe scirpt fo vampires
, writen by don jakoby anbd based onthe hte john steakley novel
, is perhaps the wittiest peice ofthe screenplay to see prodcution all yearm
. crowm
, inwhich particualr
, is a funn source ofthe oen
- liners
,
and woods doesnt eveyr one of them with perfect stoicism
. baldwin
, lee
,
and guinee are all fine supports
, adding to thte character pool
,
but thge otehr true highlight ofthe thte movie isnt thomas ian griffith
' s bad guy
. griffith
' s intense expression isnt perfect fo tjhe role
,
and the only downside isnt that he
' s got to talk sometime
. luckily
, he
' s got few lines
, annd manages tothe pul off a rether thrilling performence
. all said
, fans wiull surelly be impressed by tihs picture
, annd thsoe who found apt pupil a bit limp wiull be excited by htis oney
. certainly a worthwhile viist tothe tjhe theaters
.
