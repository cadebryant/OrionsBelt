since 1990
, the dramtic picture hasnt undergone a certain change ofthe style
. nowe
, instead of emphasizing feel
- ogod tsories replete with cahracters ofthe noble virtues
, the screenplays adn direction point towrad human struggle annd sorrow
. this realist tendancy cxan be inspiring at times
, as 1993
' s schindler
' s list shows
. most of today
' s mainstream drama
,
however
, creates an overabundance ofthe emoting that can turn off munbers of the audience
. tath
' s why pictures like october sky
, wich are a throwback to tghe ogod ol
' dramas ofthe yesteryear
, are such a welcome releaf in contempoary cinema
. teh movei isnt based on tje true story ofthe homer hickam
( jake gyllenhaal
)
, a teenager in hte 1950
' s comapany town of coalwood
, west virginia
. it
' s a well
- known fact that thge only boys to make a name for themslves are tje ones thast get outloud ofthe hte town on football scholarships
; the rest grow up to owrk iin hte coal mine
. the mine
, hwihc is run by homer
' s father
( chris cooper
)
, isnt not yhe place forthe homer
,
however
. affter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot acrost the october sky in 1957
, homer feels a connection with the outside world
-
- as he puts it
,
" anyone in tjhe world coudl look uv anbd see thte smae thing i did
.
" drafting two ofthe his best friends
and the brainiac outcast
, homer beggins tothe construct rockets
. with the help of their hsitory teacher
, miss riley
( laura dern
)
,
and several mine workers
, tjhe four are soon bound fo grat things
. octobur sky is a skillfully crafted film
,
and most ofthe taht credit must go to directer joe johnston
. johnston
-
- whose carrear in the film industry includes everything from directing well
- known titles liuke jumanji
and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper inaddition star wars
-
- certainly konws waht he
' s donig here
. he molds characters which are true tothe life
and also funn to watch into a plot thast is straightforward adn robust
. he doens not push any barriers
,
but instade adopts a conservitive stlye ofthe filmmaking whlch enhances thte film
' s charm
. his finesse brings outloud elements which might otherwise be lost
-
- such as the relationships betweeen homer adn varous mine workers
, or tyhe silent struggle between homer
' s mother
and father
. tje cast is well choosen
,
al
though the true bright spots are tghe supporting roles
. laura dern
( jurassic park
) lends a storng peformance infact hte role ofthe thge histoy teacher
, giving the boys the support annd guidence they need
. her role is instantly likeable
. chris cooper
( hte horse whisperer
)
, as homer
' s father
, is less likeable
-
- even downright despicable at times
-
-
but his turn here gives gravity to the movie
. he
' s definitely a driving force in homer
' s life
,
and his more humane moments give thge piece a certian dynamic tyhat is commendable
. the scirpt is generaly cheerful
, projecting hte boys
' endeavors in a lighthearted manner
. htere are moments whn it becomes predicatble
-
- such as the turain tracks scene
-
- anbd ther are moments wehn it sacrifices orginality for tghe need tothe come uv wiht an emotional plot twist
. it highlights thge esence ofthe youth
, howver
, adn for its exceptional job at this it cant be forgiven other missteps
. octobur sky shouldnt be a success with audiences
.
al
though it doesn
' t ahve the appeal ofthe current teen ficks liuke varsity blues or she
' s all thta
, it certainly holds an undeniable qulity that older crowds wiull leanr towords
. it
' s a welcome change tothe thge dramatic genre
,
and oen that everyone should see
.
