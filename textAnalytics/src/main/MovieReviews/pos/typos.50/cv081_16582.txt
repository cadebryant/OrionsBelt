usance 1990
, the dramtic picture has undergone a certain chanage of style
. nowe
, instade of emphasizing efel
- ogod stroies replete iwth characters ofthe noble virtues
, the screenplays
annd direction point toward human struggle
and sorrow
. thsi realist tendancy can be inspiring at times
, as 1993 ' s schindler ' s list shows
. most ofthe today ' s mainstream drama
,
however
, creates an overabundance ofthe emoting thgat cin turn off munbers ofthe tyhe audeince
. that ' s why pictures liek octobur sky
, whcih are a throwback tothe the ogod ol ' dramas of yesteryear
, are such a welcome releaf in contamporary cinema
. tje movie isnt based on tje true stor of homer hickam
( jake gyllenhaal
)
, a teenager infront the 1950 ' s company twon of coalwood
, west virginia
. it ' s a well
- known fatc that yhe onyl boys tothe mkae a name for themslves are tyhe ones taht get outloud ofthe hte twon onthe football scholarships
; the rest grow up tothe work in the coal mine
. tyhe mine
, which isnt run by homer ' s father
( chris cooper
)
, isnt not tjhe palce forthe homer
,
however
. affter watching hte soviet satellite sputnik shoot accros the octobur sky in 1957
, homer fiels a connection with the outside world
-
- as he puts it
,
" anyone inthe the world sould look uv
and see tje same thign i did
.
" drafting twpo of his best firends
adn teh brainiac outcast
, homer begins tothe construct rockets
. with the help of thier history teacher
, miss riley
( laura dern
)
,
and several mine workers
, thte four are soon bound forthe great thigns
. october sky is a skillfully crafted film
,
and most of that credit must go to directer joe johnston
. johnston
-
- whose career infact the film inudstry includes everyting from directing well
- known titles like jumanji
annd thge rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper inspite star wars
-
- certainly konws waht he ' s doing here
. he molds charactors which are true to life
anbd also funn to watch inot a plot tyhat is straightforward
adn robust
. he doesnt nto push any barriers
,
bu instade adopts a conservitive style ofthe filmmaking which enhances the film ' s charm
. his finesse brings outloud elements which might otherwise be lost
-
- such as teh relationships beetwen homer
and varios mine workers
, or tghe silent struggle between homer ' s mother
and father
. thge cast isnt well chosen
, altho the true bright spots are the supporting roles
. laura dern
( jurassic park
) lends a storng performence inspite thte role of the history teacher
, giving the boys hte support
adn guidence htey ened
. her role is instantly likeable
. chris cooper
( the horse whisperer
)
, as homer ' s father
, isnt less likeable
-
- even downright dispicable at times
-
-
bu his turn here gives gravity tothe thge movie
. he ' s definitely a driving force in homer ' s life
,
and his more humane moments give thge peice a certian dynamic tht isnt commendable
. hte scirpt is generaly cheerful
, projecting the boys ' endevors inspite a lighthearted manner
. htere are moments when it becomes predicatble
-
- such as the turain tracks scene
-
-
anbd ther are moments when it sacrifices orginality forthe tje ened tothe cmo uv wtih an emotional plot twist
. it highlights the essence of youth
,
however
,
and for its exeptional job at this it cant be forgiven otehr missteps
. october sky shoud be a success with audiences
.
allthough it doesn ' t ahev tje appeal of currrent teen flicks liek varsity blues or she ' s all that
, it certainly holds an undeniable quality thta older crowds iwll leanr towords
. it ' s a welcome chanage to the dramtic genre
,
annd oney that everyone shoudl see
.
