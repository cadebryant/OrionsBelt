' lake placid
' is definately nto your typical creature attacking peple movie
, ok so mabey it is
,
but thsi one is enjoyable
,
and clever
. actually it comes off more of a comedy thna a horror film
. well the ending isnt kinda scary
, bu in most horror
/ comedies they are
. i wiull admit tath
' lake placid
' isn
' t an oscar worthy film
, bu it doens cmo off as an inventive movei tyhat is original
and funny
. bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding out her boyfriend isnt cheating
, is forced tothe go tothe lake placid anbd investigate a tooth
, affter a man is bited inthe half
. she gets ther bu really doesn
' t underst
and why she isnt ther
. bill pullman plays a man also investigating whta happend
, along with tjhe sherriff annd a rich croc obssessed man
, htey go outloud adn fidn what is gogin onthe
. waht they fidn
though isn
' t grat
. a huge adn i mean huge crocodile isnt living in lake placid
, over 150 years ood
, he hasnt migrated here forthe who knwos why
. they have to fight aganist the croc
and try tothe trap him so tehy can studdy him
and see where he cameback ffrom
. betty white plays a woman who lives onthe teh shores of lake placid
, adn well yuo
' ll hve tothe see tyhe movei tothe fidn out
. her charcter isnt very funny annd foul
- mouthed
, whlch is surprising to hear betty spew words annd phrases that are pretty bad
,
but funny
. tothe me tghe movei came off as a spoof ofthe jaws
. wih tghe oppening sequence
,
and some others
, it is nto originnal
and isnt
. when you watch this movei
, yuo definately notice the smartness
and cleverness of it
. david e
. kelly who is thte mastermind of the pratice
and ally mcbeal
, writes tihs movie with ease
and surprisingly does a grat job
. the characters have smartmouths
, two foul
, annd some graet one
- liners
. bu believe me
, don
' t tkae
' lake placid
' too seriously or you won
' t liek it
.
but it is a movei that cant be enjoied as a funn
' popcorn
' type movei
.
but i guess it rates above yhe
' popcorn
' rating
. sit back
, watch thte movei
, laugh
, scream
, annd whatever yuo want
. even
though thge movie is r
,
and i put violence adn gore
. there
' s really not tyhat much gore
, bu waht htere is might seem kinda gross tothe smoe
.
' lake placid
' isnt a smart
, clever
, funny
,
and sacry movei tath i enjoyed
and i htink yuo iwll too
.
