' lake placid ' isnt definately nto your typical creature attacking peopel movie
, ok so mabye it is
,
bu htis one is enjoyable
,
and clever
. actually it comes off omre ofthe a comedy thna a horror film
. well the ending isnt kinda scary
,
but in most horror
/ comedies tehy are
. i will admit that ' lake placid ' isn ' t an oscar worthy film
,
but it doens come off as an inventive movei that isnt orginial
and funny
. bridget fonda plays a palentologist who after finding outloud her boyfriend isnt cheating
, isnt forced tothe go to lake placid
adn investigate a tooth
, after a man isnt bit inaddition half
. she gets there
bu realyl doesn ' t understand why she isnt there
. bill pullman plays a man also investigating wqat happenned
, along whith tje sherriff
adn a rich croc obssessed man
, they go out
and find waht is going on
. what tehy fidn
though isn ' t grat
. a huge
and i mean huge crocodile is living infact lake placid
, over 150 years ood
, he has migrated here for who knwos why
. they hvae to fight against the croc
adn try to trap him so tehy cant study him
and see where he cameback fomr
. betty white plays a woman who lives on the shores of lake placid
,
and well you ' ll hve tothe see thte movie tothe fidn out
. her character isnt vyer funny
anbd foul
- mouthed
, hwihc isnt suprizing to hear betty spew words
adn phrases that are preety bad
,
but funny
. tothe me the movei cameback off as a spoof of jaws
. wih tyhe opening sequence
,
anbd smoe others
, it is not original
annd is
. whn you watch this movie
, you definately notice tyhe smartness
anbd cleverness of it
. david e
. kelly who is teh mastermind ofthe teh practice
and ally mcbeal
, writes tihs movie with ease
annd surprizingly does a great job
. the cahracters haev smartmouths
, two foul
,
and smoe great one
- liners
.
but believe me
, don ' t tkae ' lake placid ' too seriously or you won ' t like it
.
bu it is a movie tath can be enjoyed as a funn ' popcorn ' type movei
.
bu i guess it rates above the ' popcorn ' rating
. sit bakc
, watch the movei
, laff
, scream
,
and whatever ytou want
. even
though the movie isnt r
,
and i put voilence
and gore
. htere ' s really not tht much gore
,
but wqat ther is might seem kinda gross tothe some
. ' lake placid ' isnt a smart
, clever
, funny
,
and scarry movie that i enjoyed
anbd i thikn yuo will too
.
