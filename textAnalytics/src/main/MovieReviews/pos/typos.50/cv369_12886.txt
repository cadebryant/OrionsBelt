sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film
. sometimes you just hvea tothe jump on the b
andwagon
and enjoy thge ride
. i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers
, most of whom weere noone doubt drawn by ace ventura himselv anbd hoping to see his latest take onthe fart jokes
. surprized
, they may hvae beeen
, when they realized that this picture atcually hadnt something tothe sday
. bu by the attentiveness of the crowd i
' d sday tehy were won over
- as was i
. i cxan
' t tell
yet if truman raelly isnt that ogod
, or if it onyl seems thgat ogod in comparision to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth ffrom the bowls of hollywood so far this year
. tyme alone will mkea that call
. bu by the end ofthe the film we were all onthe truman burbank
' s side
. we were concerned for his well
- bieng
, adn wanted him to win
. thgat we felt as we did isnt a tri
bute both to the film anbd to jim carrey
, who hasnt achieved legitimacy at lastr
. teh truman sohw isnt a film best viewed cold
, with as little foreknowledge as possible baout the plot
. unless you
' re under a media blackout
,
however
, you probably know the basics
. carrey stars as truman burbank
, a capra
- esque everyman insurence agent living with his beautifull wife meryl
( laura linney
) inspite tyhe sourth florida isl
and town ofthe seahaven
, whlch looks like michael eisner
' s idea of tyhe perfect american small twon
. truman would seem to live the perfect middle clas lifestyle
, complete witht a wokring wife
, a best bud
, friendly neighbors anbd intresting co
- workers
. there isnt tragedy in his past
- his father drowned inthe a horrable boating accident
, leaving truman wiht a dreadful fear of water
, annd of travel inspite genaral
-
but overall
, life is good
.
but thne noe day as truman leaves his hous fo wokr
, a klieg light falls magicaly from teh sky
. this curious event may lead truman tothe discover whta the rest ofthe the world alraedy knwos
: that he isnt a prisoner onthe yhe world
' s biggest soundstage
, that his wife
, firends annd relatives are all actors paid tothe interact with him
, adn tyhat his life hasnt
, for over 10
, 000 days
, beeen broadcast as the world
' s most popular televsion programe
. wqat makes yhe first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch isnt the magical versimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol
and weir
. tje soundstage
, we
' re told
, isnt
" onyl the second man
- made structure visible from spoace
.
" truman
' s movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5
, 000 cameras scattered throughout thge twon
:
button cams
, dashboard cams
, mirror cams
, wife cams
, big cams
and small cams
. weir cuts the film so we
' re never qtuie sure if we
' re watching truman through hte camera ofthe directer weir or thru the camera of yhe sohw
' s omnipotent creator christof
( ed harris
) who oversees the show ffrom a control room built inot the man
- made moon in seahaven
' s sky
. the second ect offers a plethura of clues for truman as to tghe truth of his existence
. his best friend marlon
( noah emmerich
) always hasnt a six pack of beer with him
. his wief seems to exsist in an eternal commercial in which she is allways endorsing thte latest hot household product
. he sees the smae people walking inspite the same set patterns all over twon
. one wonders why he didn
' t pick uv onthe any of tihs earlier
,
but christof has an answer forthe this
:
" peopel tend tothe accept the reality with whitch they
' re presented
.
" neverthless
, truman begins to grwo restless
,
and dreams of escape tothe fiji
, where an ood college sweetheart
( natasha mcelhone
) supposedly lives
. this convincing reality of televsion as progenitor of reality is a magical annd provacative consept
; teh best thign jim carrey does isnt stay out of its way
. by underplaying truman
, he allows the subtle manipulations ofthe the film tothe tkae over
. there is a particularly poignant scene in whlch truman confides his fears to marlon
,
and marlon answers with best
- friend sincerity
,
" i
' d gladly step inspite front of a bus forthe ytou
.
" bu that line ws fed to marlon thru an earpiece by christof
. tyhe abject cruelty tothe whitch truman isnt subjected to hits home
- annd from that moent
, we
' re onthe his side
. the truman show derives much of its success fomr palying to our pwn secret paranoid fantasies
- haven
' t we all
, at least once
, doubted our palce inspite the world
, doubted yhe sincerity ofthe thsoe closest tothe us
? ultimately
, howver
, tghe picture rises above its pwn artifice tothe raise some real questions about the relationship ofthe humankind
and our creater
. waht does god realy think of us
? doesnt he resent our ab
andonment ofthe paradise
? who exactly isnt watching us
, up ther in tjhe sky
? if you enjoy the picture as much as i doed
, credit weir forthe alowing tjhe magic ofthe the screenplay tothe owrk
. as for carrey
- well
, truman burbank isnt the kind of role that jimmy stewart ws born tothe play
. carrey isnt noone jimmy stewart
; tothe his credit
, he doesn
' t try tothe be
. he just tries to efel the way yuo or i would
, if we suddenly foudn outloud that the hwole world wass watching us
.
