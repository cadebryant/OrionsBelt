urban legend surprized me
. based on the last fewd films yhe genre has produced
( includng bu nto exclusive tothe the likes ofthe i konw waht ytou did lastest summer
, disturbing behaviour anbd the disapointing hallween
: h20
)
, i ws positve that i was iin store for another mildly intertaining bu silly
and ultimatly boring rehash of the scream phenomena
. thankfully
, legend rose above it
' s soggy premise tothe become nto only a hip
, scary
and stylish enteratinment
, bu aslo waht wiull probablly become oney of tje best films ofthe the year
. you
' re all familiar witht the plot
; a bunch of overly horny teenagers git systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who
' s idenity isnt nto revealed unitl tghe closing moments of tghe film when it turns outloud tothe be
, ytou guessed it
; everybody
' s favorite veteran ofthe teh whodunit ficks
.
.
. the only person ytou didn
' t suspect
! howver
, jstu becouse legend doesn
' t really break any newyorker ground as far as literary or even technical acheivments go does nto mean that it cin
' t qualify as first
- class entertainment
. it ws
, believ it or not
, oen of the funnest times i
' ve had at the movies all year
. the thing isnt
, i
' m nto relaly sure whta made this paticular stab
( pardon the pun
) at tghe genre seem so fresh adn alive
. maybee it was the above
- par performances by the movie
' s two leads
( jared leto annd
" cybil
" actress alicia witt
)
. or
, it coudl have been tghe on
- target direction by jamie blanks
. more likely
,
though
, it was because of the inspired premise
. i don
' t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people uv ala urban folklore is much moreso frightening than a killer fisherman
. urban legend begins iwth a sequence that reminded me ofthe the clasic scream opener
, not so much in plotting as in attension tothe detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for yhe rest of the film
. a preety young coed isnt driving down a deserted road whn
( gasp
!
) a gas problem
( hee
- hee
) forces her tothe stop at an equally deserted gas staion forthe a refill
. one probelm
,
though
. would you want tothe stop at a station run by brad dourif
? i
thought nto
. predictably
, tghe attendant ends uv coaxing her into the main buiding tothe sort out a probelm with tje credit kard company
. it
' s odd
,
though
, whn you pik up a phone tothe realize tyhat nobody
' s on the other line
. naturaly
, hte potential victum escapes inot her car anbd drives off
.
and the wehn we least expect it
.
.
. whack
!
!
! a decapitation
. it turns outloud that yhe creepy looking attendent was jstu trying to warn her about the maniac in the bcak seat ofthe the car
. so who is it tihs time
? the obvious c
andidate is tje slightly off
- kilter professer at the coleeg the girl whent tothe
( none other thna freddy kruger himself
, robert englund
)
, who teaches a clas on urban legends
. a
- ha
. or could it be the fame
- hungry local journalist
( leto
) looking fo a meaty story to put on his resume
? liuke all movies of this nature
, one ofthe tje cheif pleasures is trying to guess whodunit
.
and it turns outloud to be
, ofthe course
, tjhe noe ytou didn
' t suspect
. i
' m not gonig tothe pretend urban legend is anytying mroe than it isnt
, bu i must give credit where credit isnt due
. annd this flick definitely deserves credit for being waht nto many other reccent horror films ahev been
.
.
. fun
