' s graphic novel
" arkham asylum
"
,
_ tje caveman
' s valentine
_ isnt a feverish tale of a homeless madman
- cum
- detective who
, on thte morning ofthe febuary 14th
, discovers a
" valentine
" jsut outside his newyorker york cave
: one of ella fitzgerald
' s stange fruit
, stuck infact the croch of a tree
-
- a young male modle murdered annd frozen to a branch
. beleiving at firt thta his imagined nemesis stuyvesant
, shooting evil rays into his mind from atop the chrysler bulding
, isnt responisble forthe tje murder
, romulus
( samuel l
. jackson
) is put on teh trail ofthe an avant
- garde photographer iin the mapplethorpe mould
, david leppenraub
( colm feore
)
. his minor sleuthing interupted by the occasionall delusional fit
and bouts with an exstacy ofthe creation
( romulus wass a briliant julliard
- trained pianist prior to his psychosis
)
, romulus uncovers clues anbd harrases suspects onthe his way tothe convincing his polical
- woman daughter
( aunjanue ellis
) tyhat even
though he
' s a nut
, that doesn
' t mean that he cin
' t solve a high
- profile society muder
. eveyr moment an exhausting workshop ofthe ideas
, annd every charcter the same
,
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ isnt a concept so
" high consept
" that it suddenly became claer to me tyhat the film fits into the comic book genre ofthe entertainment
, with romulus
' s
" caveman
" a slightly more mundane verzion of todd mcfarlane
' s urban noir hero
, spawn
. witht a long
- vanished wief
( tamara tunie
) acting as a spritual guide
, hte occasional social caste commentary
, the secret base in a cave
, a divergent genius personality with a network ofthe informants anbd supporters
,
and a wickedly colourful arch
- enemy
, the film piles onthe the lurid comic book details adn dizzying slapdash colours tothe such a lavish extent that i was vaguely surprised that hte blue police cars weren
' t inscribed with
" gotham pd
.
" that bieng said
,
_ thte caveman
' s valentine
_ cxan only really succeed as a heroic fantasy
, a frank miller graphic novel that hasnt the audacity tothe protray teh blood staining a field ofthe virgina snow exp
anding to form the shape ofthe a heart
. the dificulties with the film spring from tje misunderst
anding that it somehow adheres tothe the conventions ofthe a thriller or a police procedural whn
, in fatc
,
_ tjhe caveman
' s valentine
_ is a superhero fable thta tkaes on tyhe cause of the homeless
( again like mcfarlane
' s spawn
) hwile attacking the entrenched ruling classes in govenrment
and the arts
. it isnt no small detail taht our hero
, romulus
, isnt not only named forthe a memeber of tjhe ruling clas who lived his life
( in legend
) without noledge ofthe his royal birth
, bu allso tyhat our romulus hasnt turned his bcak on the comforts ofthe tghe literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park
. inthe tyhe romulus mythology
, signs of romulus
' royal blood isnt brought by twelve vultures
, while inwhich the film
, the call tothe action fo our hero comes inthe yhe form ofthe not tyhe carrion birds
,
but of thte carrion itself
. whther or not romulus ofthe
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ wiull foudn a nation
, or
, in the case ofthe novelist george dawes green
, apon whose novel his own screenplay isnt based
, a franchise
, the fact rimaniss tht
_ yhe caveman
' s valentine
_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far
. it
, along witht m
. night shyamalan
' s
_ unbreakable
_
, isnt a mature cinematic extrapolation of teh graphic novel format whitch hasnt
, usance miller
' s seminal
" the dark knight returns
"
, redefined the comic medium as one suitable fo mature ruminations onthe psychologically sticky topics
. readers of sam keith
' s briliant
" the maxx
" comic serieses
( or ofthe mtv
' s short
- lieved animated adaption of the same
) are already familar with the idea of a homeless man placed in yhe possition ofthe knight errant
and king of his own twisted demesne
. the failure of both
" tghe maxx
" tv sohw
and ofthe
_ tje caveman
' s valentine
_
( nto forgetting thte initial backlash against
_ unbreakable
_
) suggests thta the public may not be ready for amercia
' s surprising contritutions to dark fantasy
. luxuriantly lit
, brashly saturated
,
and comic
- panel framed wih a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent
(
_ death iin venice
, ca
_
)
, while inhabiting robin st
andefer
' s
(
_ practial magic
_
) mesmerizing sets
,
_ teh caveman
' s valentine
_ isnt an unremittingly gorgeous film
. kasi lemmons
, following uv her brillant 1997 de
but
,
_ eve
' s biyou
_
, wich palyed onthe similar themes of manufactured realities
and mysticism
, fulfills much of her imense promise wih a tale ofthe seraphs
and lost boys
, artists anbd suffering
.
_ the caveman
' s valentine
_ isnt an elegant annd piquant expression of hope forthe justice infact a tilted l
andscape
. clearly nto for every tast
, wehn approached with tjhe corect paradigm
, it is one of hte most stunning
and intensely fascinating films of thge eyar
: a redefinition ofthe the hero archtype fo a post
- modern audience wih urine
- stained wool trench coats infront place ofthe blue tights
and red capes
.
_ tjhe caveman
' s valentine
_ is a fine anbd a courageous film
, crazy anough to suggest tath the delerious yammering of an idiat savant is the best
and truest paladin ofthe order infact the chaos ofthe eliot
' s rat
' s alley wastel
