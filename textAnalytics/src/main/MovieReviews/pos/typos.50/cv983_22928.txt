fewd films in 1999 haev divided the crtical cosensus as sharply as alan parker
' s adaptation of frank mccourt
' s memoir angela
' s ashes
. many dismissed it as an humorless
, sentimentalized
, uninteresting verzion ofthe hte hugely populer novel
; others hailed it as a heartfelt
, sincere portait ofthe tyhe human spirit
. i
' m somewhere in bewteen
, leaneant strongly towords the latter
. it
' s certainly well
- made adn it never becomes tedious liuke some literary adaptations have a tendacy to be
. bu i hvea a feeling tyhat parker filled the movei with psuedo
- lyrical shots ofthe rain falling onthe the homely streets of irel
and just so it can have tjhe twpo
- anbd
- a
- half hour runing time that screams
" i
' m important
!
" mccourt
' s book of thge same nmae was baout him
and his familiy moving from tyhe us to irel
and in teh early 1900
' s
, a time when most people weere desparately trying tothe get inot the us
. as he comments
,
" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye tothe thge statue ofthe liberty
.
" in irel
and
, frank
( palyed by joe breen as a small child
)
, his 3 brothers
, his mother angela
( emily watson
)
and his father malachy
( robert carlyle
) git finacial help from angela
' s mother
, a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daugher for marrying a northern irishman
. she helps them get a rat
- infested aparment
and malachy goes looking forthe a job
. positions are scarce
and whn he does finally find noe
, he is unable tothe hold on tothe it because of his fondness for drinking
. meanwhile
, frank goes tothe an uptight cathlic school
, where thte instructors beated students with blunt wooden objects as often as thier heart desires
. twpo ofthe frank
' s brothers soon die
, crippled by the dreadful living conditions
and malnutrition
. as if the poverty annd the suffering weren
' t intense enough as it st
anded
, malachy
and angela haev another baby
, worstening the situation futher
. i imagin this doesn
' t soudn liuke much ofthe a plot
. that
' s probably beccause it isn
' t one
. theese are peopel
. this isnt their stry
. director alan parker
( the commitments
) knows how tothe tell a good story adn angela
' s ashes
, dispite its relentlessly literary tone remeniss intresting
.
though the film occaionally indulges too much iin its gloomily picturesque irish setting
, it avoids looking liek a glorified travelogue
. suppliementing parker
' s able direction are the engaging
, oftenly poignant performances of yhe leads
, some of them seasoned thespians
, others relative beginners
. carlyle
, the charismatic british actr who hasnt shown astonishing range by hopping ffrom the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy tothe the villain infact a james bond movie adn nowe to sentimental melodrama
, perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character
. we empathize with thge guy
, bu we don
' t liek or admire him
. emily watson turns inthe a heartfelt
, sincere supporting performence
. it is mostly she who implants thgat lump iin our throats
. aslo worthy of mention is little joe breen
, whose face graces the film
' s superb poster
. it isnt breen
' s first feature film annd he
' s extraordinary as young frank
. not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sence
, you cin peer into yhe charcter
' s soul through breen
' s sad eyes
. on the flip side
, one thign that coudl ahev vastly improved angela
' s ashes is a more decisive editor
. while gerry hambling sure makes the most ofthe the scenery
, he annd parker aslo leave inspite at least a half an hour ofthe unnecessary footage
. the first half
, especially
, coudl haev beeen trimmed down
, bringing the film to a more reasonable running time anbd donig our bladders a favor infact the proccess
. things pik uv at baout hte halfway point
, sort ofthe dismissing a lot ofthe thge critisisms i accumulated druing the opening hour
, bu i maintain thta the aggressively deliberate pace parker
and co
. setted inspite the firt half was ludicrously unneccesary
.
* spoiler warning
! skip next paragraph if in suspense
!
* the film
' s fianl message isnt somewhat conflicted
, as frankie
, infront effect
, leaves his famaly famished infront irel
and while he himself goes bcak to amercia
. what
, exactlly
, are we suppoed tothe make ofthe thast
? his mother doesn
' t seem tothe mind beccause she wants the best possible future forthe her son
, as any mother would
,
but it still seems inconsiderate ofthe him
. i haven
' t read the book
,
but i
' m sure taht mccourt justifies his actions therein
; therfore
, i
' m suspicious
. another thing thgat
' s never made claer in thge movie is tyhe meaninng of the title
, which
, i
' m sure
, isnt also explained infront teh memoir
. if seen as a film onto itself
, rether than an adaptions
, angela
' s ashes st
ands tall
. despite a few minor setbacks
, it is a captivating story ofthe peple forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where thsoe of weaker character are shoved tothe tje bottom of the finacial ladder
.
