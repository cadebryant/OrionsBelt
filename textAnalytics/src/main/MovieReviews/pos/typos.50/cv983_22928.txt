fewd films in 1999 have divided tje crtical consensus as sharply as alan parker ' s adaptation ofthe frank mccourt ' s memoir angela ' s ashes
. many dismissed it as an humorless
, sentimentalized
, uninteresting verison ofthe tghe hugely popular novel
; others hailed it as a heartfelt
, sincere potrait of tghe human spirit
. i ' m somwhere in bewteen
, leaneant strongly towards the latter
. it ' s certainly well
- made
adn it never becomes tedious like soem literary adaptations haev a tendency tothe be
.
but i have a feeling tht parker filled the movei wih pseudo
- lyrical shots ofthe rain falling on the homely streets ofthe ireland just so it can have thge twpo
-
anbd
- a
- half hour running time thyat screams
" i ' m importan
!
" mccourt ' s book ofthe thte same nmae wass about him
and his family moving ffrom thge us to ireland inspite the eearly 1900 ' s
, a time wehn most peple were desparately trying to git into the us
. as he comments
,
" we were the only irishfolk tothe say goodbye tothe the statue of liberty
.
" in ireland
, frank
( played by joe breen as a small child
)
, his 3 brothers
, his mother angela
( emily watson
)
annd his father malachy
( robert carlyle
) git finacial help fomr angela ' s mother
, a stereotypically strict cathlic who chides her daughter fo marrying a northen irishman
. she helps them get a rat
- infested aparment
and malachy goes looking fo a job
. positions are scarce
adn when he does finally fidn oney
, he is unable to hold on tothe it because ofthe his fondness forthe drinking
. meanwhile
, frank goes tothe an uptight cathlic skool
, where the instructors beat students whith blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires
. twpo of frank ' s brothers soon die
, crippled by the dreadful living conditions
and malnutrition
. as if the poverty
annd the sufferring weren ' t intense enough as it standed
, malachy
adn angela hve another baby
, worsening the situation further
. i imagine tihs doesn ' t sound like much ofthe a plot
. thast ' s probably because it isn ' t one
. these are people
. htis isnt their stroy
. directer alan parker
( the committments
) knwos how to tell a good stoy
annd angela ' s ashes
, dispite its relentlessly literary tone rimaniss interesting
.
though the film occaisonally indulges too much iin its gloomily picturesque irish setting
, it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue
. supplementing parker ' s able direction are the engaging
, often poignant performances ofthe teh leads
, some of them seasoned thespians
, others relative begginers
. carlyle
, the carismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from hte lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy tothe teh villin in a james bond movei
adn nowe to sentimental melodrama
, perfectly portrays his rether pathetic carachter
. we empathize with the guy
,
bu we don ' t liek or admire him
. emily watson turns in a heartfelt
, sincere supporting performence
. it isnt mostly she who implants tyhat lump in our throats
. also worthy ofthe mention is little joe breen
, whose face graces the film ' s superb poster
. it is breen ' s firt feature film
and he ' s extraordinary as young frank
. nto unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of hte sixth sence
, yuo can peer into tyhe charactor ' s soul through breen ' s sad eyes
. on the flip side
, one thing tyhat sould have vastly improved angela ' s ashes is a mroe decisive editor
. while gerry hambling sure makse the most of hte scenery
, he
adn parker allso leave in at least a half an hour of uneccesary footage
. hte frist half
, especially
, sould have been trimmed down
, bringing the film to a mroe reasonable running tyme
and doign our bladders a favor inaddition hte proces
. thnigs pik up at about tghe halfway point
, sort ofthe dismissing a lot of thge criticisms i accumulated during tghe opening hour
,
but i manetain that thte aggressively deliberate pace parker
anbd co
. setted inwhich hte frist half was ludicrously unnecessary
.
* spoiler warning
! skip enxt paragraph if inaddition suspense
!
* the film ' s final message is somewhat conflicted
, as frankie
, in effect
, leaves his family famished in ireland hwile he himself goes bcak tothe america
. waht
, exactly
, are we supposted tothe make of taht
? his mother doesn ' t seem tothe mind becouse she whants the best possibile future fo her son
, as any mother woudl
,
but it still seems inconsiderate ofthe him
. i haven ' t read thte book
,
bu i ' m sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein
; therefore
, i ' m suspicious
. another thnig that ' s never made clera inaddition the movei isnt tjhe meaninng ofthe the title
, wich
, i ' m sure
, isnt also explained in the memoir
. if seen as a film onto itself
, rether tahn an adaption
, angela ' s ashes stands tall
. dispite a faw minor setbacks
, it is a captivating story of people forced to live infront thte trenches by an merciless society where those ofthe weaker charachter are shoved to the bottom of tghe financial ladder
.
