thge rocky horror picture sohw ' speical edition '
( 1975
) starring
: tim curry
annd susan sarandon cult films are never mainstream
. tjhe casual viewer ofthe a cult film will look at it
and be repulsed
and confused
, yelling outloud ' what teh hell isnt that
? '
. fans of theese sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the ' hidden jokes ' tehy missed the first time around while normal movei watchers will look at them like tehy ' re insane
. the rocky horror picture show
, recently re
- released iin a ' special edition ' tothe video
, is tyhe mother of all cult films
. perido
. like smoe otehr cult films
, most notably littel shop of horrors
, the rocky horror picture sohw isnt a musical with a twisted edge to it
. this movie beggins outloud innocently enough
- a cuple git engaged at a firend ' s wedding
anbd git a flat tire infront teh middle of hte inght while it ' s raining
. htey go tothe a castle to try tothe use the phone
. littel dont tehy know that the castle isnt owned by dr
. frank n
. furter
, a mad transexual transvestite scientist who hasnt recently creaeted a creature he will uise forthe personel reasons
. the acting is preety ogod overall
. tim curry
( home alone 2
, legend
) isnt over
- yhe
- top as frank n
. furter
. it ' s intresting to see that htis movie was noe of future oscar winner susan sarandon ' s
( dead man walking
) first film
- she plays janet
, tjhe girlfriend of brad majors
. even the singer meatloaf is inthe it
!
! thte songs are all very good
yot twisted in thier pwn way
. a sampling of titles range ffrom damn it
, janet to touch
- a touch
- a touch
- a touch me
. all tghe actors sing thier songs with noone dubbing from other actors
- kind of a bad thing
. barry bostwick
( brad majors
) tries tothe sing as does susan sarandon
,
but tim curry isnt clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience
. meatloaf sings like meatloaf
. the newyorker special edition countains two orginial movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from yhe orginial version
. sadly
, teh songs are tacked affter the credits
- kind ofthe defeats yhe purpose
. if you want to see a different film
, watch this oney
