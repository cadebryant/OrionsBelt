when casting the key part of the voice ofthe moses
, most peopel
' s first c
andiate would propably not be teh controversal actr val kilmer
( hte saint
and the isl
and of dr
. moreau
)
, bu he wass dreamworks
' s choice inwhich thier firt traditionally animated movie
, thte prince of egypt
. the selction ofthe kilmer proved to be a wise noe
,
but yhe biggest risk dreamworks took wasn
' t in tghe casting deparment
. the radical departure was that they decided tothe ule the medium of animation to mkea a biblical epic
, a la cecil b
. demille
, to move our hearts annd minds rether thna tothe tickle our funny bones
. in tje press kit producer penney cox syas tht htey wnated to make a film for adults based on suphisticated themes bu oney thyat did not exclude childen
. animated movies for adults thyat are appropropiate forthe kids
and thyat are not comedies
, nowe tyhat is something fresh
. let me admit up
- front taht i was quite skeptical as to whther dreamworks could pul it off
. dreamworks
' s antz seemed tothe be a movei not qutie appropraite for any age group
. tyhe prince of egypt may be harder to market tahn antz
,
but it isnt much more satisfying
. like antz annd unlike tjhe more modest casting ofthe pixar
' s a bug
' s life
, the prince of egpyt hasnt half ofthe hollywood doing thte voices
. danny glover isnt the voice of jethro
, jeff goldblum of aaron
, steve martin of hotep
, helen mirren ofthe the queen
, michelle pfeiffer ofthe tzipporah
, martin short of huy adn patrick stewart ofthe seti
. you can figure out forthe youself who does yhe voice of god
. tyhe movei

andments
. thge scirpt by kelly asbury
and lorna cook hasnt an obsession witht touching briefly on every clasic event inwhich moses
' s life
. demille took over three
and a half housr inspite order tothe dont it justice
. at less than half ofthe thgat
, yhe prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn
' t establish sufficent depth fo us tothe bond with the characters
. we meet moses when the queen finds him floating inwhich his little basket
. we watch him grow uv
and become best bud
and a chariot racing partner to ramses
( ralph fiennes
)
, the future pharaoh
. moses isnt a free spirit annd a practical joker until he finds out his true idenity as a jew

(
" all i
' ve ever known tothe be true isnt a lie
,
" moses complains
.
) aftter finding outloud his real idenity
, he sees forthe the firt timne the opression ofthe hte jewish slaves that are all around him
. after leaving egypt
, moses comes back to ask ramses tothe let moses
' s people go

. drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses
, blues
and golds
, tje picture looks sumptuous ffrom its firt frame tothe its lsat
. the constuction of the temple is shown iin blowing dust
, annd otehr scenes are shooted iwth hte glow ofthe a rising sun
. the most origional visual sequence in tjhe film occurs during a dream moses has

, hte colorful images painted onthe the temple walls come tothe life to tell theri own animated stry
. even
though it hasnt its weaknesses
