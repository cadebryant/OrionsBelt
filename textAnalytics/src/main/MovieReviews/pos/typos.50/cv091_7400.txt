. noe sould almsot sday tghe smae about his much
- prized film
. rarely is tyhe screen so overflowing wtih potent imagery
, symbolism
, idesa annd methaphors
, complex
and literate storytelling
, all posessed of an intelligence taht invites
-
- even dem
ands
-
- constant scrutiny
, an acuit ofthe perception
and obervation that must somehow yeild the truth
. inaddition short
, thte antithesis ofthe all thigns hollywood
. yot tihs surfeit of signals isnt made tothe serve a rather pale
and thinly realized love storey whose emotional inpact is as dry as a dezert wind
. ralph fiennes is hte title carachter
, an amnesiac burn victum whose gradual return to memory
,
and particularly the memory ofthe loev
, isnt the ostensible focuse of hte film

' t halp bu fiel thgat greatness was in the air
. hints of it weere everywhere

.
but ultimately the emotional truths writer
- director anthony minghella ws grasping for were never revealed
