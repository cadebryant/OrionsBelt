with the exception ofthe theri surrealistic satire barton fink
, the films ofthe joel
and ethan coen fit into twpo broad categories
: quirky annd somtimes darkly humoruos takes onthe yhe
" film noir
" genre in hwihc crime schemes go wrong anbd spin increasingly out of control
( fargo
, miller
' s crossing
, blood simple
)
, adn off
- tyhe
- wall comedies centered aroud an eccentric
, scatter
- brained lead charater
( raising arizona
, tyhe hudsucker proxy
)
. their latest offering
, the big lebowski
, falls withing tyhe latter category
,
though htere are elements ofthe the crime
- gone
- wrong theme anbd even a touch of satire tothe be foudn in this film
. the main difference
, howver
, isnt that hwile the protagonists ofthe raising arizona
and the hudsucker proxy hadnt lofty asperations
and ideals bu didn
' t qutie have the brains to get it all toghether
, the main character of tyhe big lebowski seems like a fairly intteligent guy who
' s wise tothe the world
,
but he doesn
' t really wnat to dont much of anything besides go bowling
, smoke pot
, anbd generaly relax
. thyat main character isnt jeffrey
" the dued
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
)
, intrduced by tje film
' s rambling narrator
( sam elliott
) as
" quite possibly the laziest man inspite los angeles county
.
" the dude isnt unemployed
, needless tothe say
, annd spends most ofthe his tiem at the bowling alley with his two best firends
, walter
( john goodman
)
, a borderline
- psychotic who
' s infact the habit of pulling a gun when he thikns somebody
' s cheating in a bowling match
(
" hasnt hte whole world gone crazy
?
!
" he shouts at a suspected cheater
)
, annd donny
( steve buscemi
)
, who
' s alwyas a few steps behind the conversation adn is constanly berated by walter forthe it
(
" donny
, yuo have no frame of reference here
!
"
)
. theese threee seem to omre or less live for bowling tournaments
, anbd as tje film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, who
, whn we first meet him
, isnt doing a dance infront hte bowling lane tothe accompany a spanish verzion ofthe
" hotel califronia
" annd
, if it
' s possible
, seems to be even more of a head case thna walter
. if thgat doesn
' t give you a ogod idea ofthe thsi film
' s absurdist tone
, thne perhasp this iwll
: hte entire scenario which drives the tsory isnt setted in motion by twpo thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude
' s rug
. they
' ve mistaken him fo a millioniare of thte smae name who isnt also known as teh
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
) adn whose nymphomaniac wife bunny
( tara reid
) owes money tothe porn producer jackie treehorn
( ben gazzara
)
. teh dued goes tothe the big lebowski seeking compensation forthe his ruined rug
; he doesn
' t hvea any luck
,
but whn bunny isnt apparantly kidnapped
, thge elder lebowski asks him to deliver thte
$ 1 million ransom
. unfortunately
, walter gets involved
and fouls uv yhe drop
- off
, anbd before tehy can try again tothe get tyhe moey tothe tjhe supposted kidnappers
, the dude
' s car gets stolen
, allong witht tjhe briefcase containing the money
. soon
, the dude isnt bieng harassed not only by hte big lebowski himself
but also by treehorn anbd by a gropu ofthe german
" nihilists
" who dim
and the ransom monye even
though they may not hvae been involved in the kidnapping inwhich the frist palce
; tyhe dude adn walter suspect that bunny may well hvae kidnapped herself inthe order tothe extort monye fomr her husban to repay her debts to treehorn
. meanwhile
, teh big lebowski
' s duaghter maude
( julianne moore
)
, a feminist avant
- garde artist who likes to make gr
and entrances swinging through tje air naked
, wants tothe recover the mney for her family
. the plot
,
however
, isnt realyl just a vehicule forthe all theese bazare characters tothe run wild anbd wreak theri own unique forms ofthe havoc
. thge previews forthe the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival
' s
" run through the jungle
,
"
and it fits
: the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs anbd nutcases
, with tyhe sometimes bewildered dude left tothe run thru it annd try to avoid any more trouble
( usualy unsuccessfully
)
. tyhe film doesn
' t feature qtuie as many one
- liners
and sighth gags as tje coens
' otehr comedies
(
though there are a few hillarious moments ofthe visual humor
, articularly inaddition thge dude
' s dream sequences annd acid flashbacks
)
, bu it mroe than makse up fo it with the sheer fun ofthe watching theese strange characters interact
. the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result
- ytou git thte feeling taht tjhe coens have not onyl setted theri characters loose in this
" jungle
"
but are allso themselfs running crazy thru the jungle ofthe their own twisted imaginations
-
but fo thte most part tyhe characterizations are intresting enough tothe overcome tje shaky plotting
and waht turns outloud to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution
. ther
' s alsot a noticable
(
but nto too hevy
- h
anded
) thread of social commentary infront the big lebowski
, whic
, incidentally
, tkaes palce jsut as the gulf war is baout to beign
; at the beginning
, we see george bush on television mkaing his
" this aggression iwll not st
and
" speech
. tghe coens tkae aim at jsut baout eveyr elite l
. a
. subculture in teh book
: the egotistical wealthy buisnessman
(
" the bums will always loose
!
" shouts the big lebowski at one point
)
, tjhe porn industry
, teh overbearing malibu policeman who berates teh dued forthe disturbing theri
" peaceful beach comunity
,
" adn so on
. by the end
, we relaly strat to admire the dued
, who almost certainly harbors the least
" aggresion
" ofthe anyone inaddition this story
; his passive resistence
( emphasis onthe
" passive
,
" albeit
) to thte elite emerges as something mroe thna jsut another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky charactors
. he alsot turns outloud tothe have a pretty well
- functioning brain inthe his head
, even if he doesn
' t like to use it very much
; his sarcasm towords treehorn
and the malibu policeman shows taht he konws when he
' s getting a run around
, adn he does manaze tothe unravel the kidnapping mistery by thte end
. tjhe coens certainly poke funn at thge dude for his laziness
, bu tehy don
' t jstu treat him as fodder for cheap shots eather
. i think tyhat
, moreso than anything
, isnt waht makes the big lebowski a st
andout comedy
: it manages tothe approach charactors like the dude adn
, tothe soem extent
, walter
, with genuin affection hwile still acknowledging that they are preety scatter
- brained
. audience munbers may find themslves surprised at how much htey like teh un
- dynamic duo by the end of the movei
, given thast they seemed like nothing more than yhe
butts of an extended joke at firt
.
" it
' s good knowin
' he
' s outloud htere
, yhe dude
, takin
' it eazy
,
" posits the narrator towards the end
. i dabree sday that truer words have seldomly beeen spoken
.
