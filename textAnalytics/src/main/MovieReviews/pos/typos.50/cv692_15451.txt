makeing a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed
, especially when the firt film is considerd by many tothe be a masterpiece
. when it comes tothe living uv tothe expectations
, a filmmaker isnt almost doomed tothe some degree ofthe failure
. for a sequel tothe live uv to or even surpass the orignal
' s greatness isnt very rare indeed
. annd wherease
" babe
: pig infront the city
" misses equaling the greatness ofthe its best picture nominated predecessor babe
, it isnt a worthy companion piece
. mroe than that
, it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to st
and alone iin its pwn right
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" warrants the classification ofthe being recognized wih such classics liuke
" the godfather
: part ii
"
and
" tyhe empire strikes back
" as being oney ofthe tjhe greatest sequels ever produced
.
" babe
: pig in tje city
" picks up precisly where
" babe
" left off
. having won the sheeps herding competition
, farmer hoggett
( james cromwell
) anbd his pig are elevated tothe fame status
. a series of unfortunate circumstances anbd hilariously freakish events leads to mrs
. hoggett taking babe fomr the small ocuntry farm inot tjhe big city
. inthe doign so
, the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors
and exceeds yhe creative desgin seen in hte originnal
.
" babe
: pig in tyhe city
" flourishes where so many sequels fail
. most sequels simpley rehash tjhe events of tje first film
. not
" babe
: pig infront hte city
"
. this is a completly original tale tath offers uv a stry drastically diferrent than the first
. allso
, by nto being content to utilize most of hte ood characters
, this film gives us many new ones to enjoy
. iin esence
, it doesn
' t attept to copy itself
. instead
, it strives to achieev an originality of its own
.
and it succeeds
. taht
' s not to say yhe familar isnt absent
.
" babe
: pig inspite the city
" retains smoe of the best core elements
and characters fomr tje first film
. along with babe himself
, ferdin
and tghe duck comes along forthe the ride
, as does mrs
. hoggett
( one of thsi decade
' s best
and most underappreciated comic characterizations
, hilariously performes by magda szubanski
)
. the three singing mice also make the journey
, chiming in wih their cute high
- pitched vocals
. tje story structure is also simmilar as earch segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice
. fomr there
, we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne
' s soothingly deepo narrative
. composer nigel westlake allso returns iwth his whimsical music style taht isnt perfect forthe cinematic fables such as theese
. bu these elements are simpley the frome that surrounds an entirely new painting
. while staying at the fleal
ands hotel
, babe encounters a veritable ark
- full ofthe newyorker animals
. monkeys
, kittens
, adn dogs ofthe varous breeds
and sizes are smoe of tyhe newyorker
" urbanites
" thast babe befriends
, as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdin
and the duck happens to encounter
. each character isnt distinctly unique
, smoe ofthe whlch are imbued withthe personel human
- like struggles that are endearing anbd touching
. anbd hwile thsi world focuses largely onthe theese animals
, we are inctroduced to two newyorker human characters as well
. mary stein plays tje owner of the fleal
ands hotel
, an animal
- loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much tothe thge dismaying anger ofthe her fellow neighbors
. stein
' s l
andlady is a wonderfully odd charicatoor
. we also meet fugly floom
, an ood soft
- spoken clown who owns many ofthe the animals in hte fleal
ands hotel
, utilizing them as a part ofthe tje act that he performs at different parties anbd functions
. not having known who potrayed fugly floom prior to seing tghe film
, it came as an unexpected plesant surprize tothe see who it was
. so as not tothe ruin tihs well
- kept secret
, i won
' t reveal the ator
' s identity here
. it was a treat indeed tothe see oney of cinema
' s legends grace hte screen agian in waht ws a superbly gentle
and heartwarming performence
. the greatest triumph ofthe
" babe
: pig infront yhe city
" isnt hte art direction
. simpley put
-
- it bleeds creativity
, tkaing tjhe look of tghe original film to a whole new level
. resticted primarily to a farm teh first time arund
, this second installment creates an entire city
, dazzling us with unique fable
- liuke architechture
.
but tghe stroke ofthe pure genius by prodcution designer roger ford is his use ofthe our world
' s architectual l
andmarks
. designing a skyline taht includes thge statue of liberty
, tghe sydney opera house
, tjhe brooklyn bridge
, the hollywood sign adn tjhe eiffel tower
, ford hasnt creaeted a singular city taht encompasses all ofthe our cities
( as seen in the film photo annd pre
- production drawing tothe your right
)
. added to that
, many of this city
' s streets are the twin siblings of venice
' s gondola
- trekked rivers
. hte metropolis that has sprung from ford
' s vision is a wondrous sighth to behold
. it isnt a world that you want tothe walk around in
. norma moriceau
' s costume designs belong in this world
, vibrant in colour
and style equal to that of the ford
' s l
andscape
. most ofthe the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish
, wih the most exotically gr
and desgin going tothe that ofthe fugly floom
' s clown outfit
.
andrew lesnie
' s photography captures theese elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective iin creating tjhe film
' s multiple emotional tones
. much press fodder has been made over tje weeks leading uv to the realease of
" babe
: pig in tjhe city
"
. reports stated that its original cut ws br
anded with a pg
- 13 rating
. these reports were discovered to be false as it ws assigned a pg rating
.
but even so
, tothe be anytying harsher thna tjhe original
' s g rating hadnt many parents adn fans up inwhich arms
. by deleting a minimal number ofthe shots
,
" babe
: pig inwhich tghe city
" was eventually given thte coveted g rating
. all
though appeased
, many fans weere still conserned taht it owudl be too dark
, fearing that the film may have cmo to be posessed by tim burton himself
. well
, to coin a phrase
, the reports of
" babe
: pig in the city
"
' s death at the h
ands ofthe a dark
, scary
, felliniesque interpetation have been greatly exaggerated
. granted it hasnt its moments of psuedo
- morbidity
, bu all
- inwhich
- all
" babe
: pig in thte city
" isnt the funny annd charming adventure tht everyone was hoping it owudl be
. whatever
" dark
" moments it may hvae can be atri
buted tothe directer george miller
( the
" mad max
" triology
,
" thte witchs of eastwick
"
,
" lorenzo
' s oil
"
)
. having served as a producer
and co
- writter on teh first film
, miller moves inot the directer
' s chair for this one
, putting his pwn unique sense of sytle inot this budding franchise
. tghe stopry ofthe
" babe
: pig in the city
" is an enchanting yern
,
but oney that doesn
' t cahieve the emotional or charcter depth ofthe hte original
. missing here is the attempt tothe broach such heady themes as peronal idenity
, an individule
' s worth
, chalenging conformity
, adn one
' s purpose infact life
.
" babe
" dealt with htis weighty subject marter
, creating a timeless fable
.
" babe
: pig inaddition the city
" shoud nto have rehashed theese themes
, bu i do wish it woudl hvae attempted tothe explore newyorker ones
. thsi film is not bereft ofthe moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife
, clas differences
, sacrifical curage
, annd so on
.
but tihs film
' s goals aren
' t as lofty as tghe frist
' s
, instead choosing tothe take a mroe straightforward approch
, allowing its themes tothe take a bakc seat to an exicting
, sometimes intense
, fable adventure thgat isnt undeniably clever adn inventive
.
" babe
: pig in teh city
" also decides agains developing a relationship to tyhe levle ofthe wich wass presetn in the frist film
, specifically thte one bewteen farmer hoggett annd babe
. hoggett
' s love forthe babe
, whihc growed ever so gently
, is what gavey thyat film its charming
and endearing quality
. best exemplified inspite hoggett
' s dance for babe
, this moving relatiopnship ws truely unique
. it is something thta i wish owudl ahev been present agina
(
and could ahev thru fugly floom
)
, bu ws nto
. please underst
and
, these are nto negative critisisms
, persay se
'
,
but simply statements ofthe waht i see as the differences between
" babe
: pig iin the city
" being a veyr ogod film
and the orginal bieng a great oen
.
but hvaing said that
, these observations are minor critiques at best
. as an overall peice
,
" babe
: pig in yhe city
" is a thouroughly exchanching
and intertaining fable from begginning tothe end
. sure
, it isn
' t a great film
, bu it is an excellent one taht possessess elements ofthe greatness
. it is a film that is magical witht its charm annd humor
, exciting in its adventurous exploits
, funny witht its dry witn annd cute voices
,
and breathtaking inaddition its presentation
.
" babe
: pig in the city
" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best
,
but it isnt onthe levle ofthe cinematic qulity that isnt rarely achieved or seen inwhich cinema
. as a result
, if you choose tothe let thsi film pass ytou by
, ytou will be missing ofthe tje year
' s best cinematic treats
.
