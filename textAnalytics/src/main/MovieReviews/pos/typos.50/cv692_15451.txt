making a sequal to a widely beloved film isnt a weighty proposition indeed
, especially when the first film isnt consdidered by many tothe be a masterpiece
. when it comes tothe living uv tothe expectations
, a filmmaker isnt almost doomed tothe some degree ofthe failure
. for a sequel to live uv tothe or even surpass yhe originnal ' s greatness isnt vyre rare indeed
.
adn whereas
" babe
: pig in tjhe city
" misses equaling hte greatness of its best picture nominated precedessor babe
, it isnt a worthy companion piece
. mroe tahn that
, it is a spectacular wrok of art thgat deserves tothe stand alone infact its pwn right
.
" babe
: pig in thge city
" warrants tjhe classification of bieng reconized wiht such classics like
" hte godfather
: part ii
"
and
" the empire strikes bcak
" as being oen ofthe the greatest sequels ever produced
.
" babe
: pig in tyhe city
" picks up precisely where
" babe
" left off
. haveing won the sheeps herding competition
, farmer hoggett
( james cromwell
)
and his pig are elevated tothe fame status
. a sories of unfortunate circumstances
adn hilariously freakish events leads to mrs
. hoggett tkaing babe from the small ocuntry farm into thte big city
. iin doing so
, thge film transports us inot a wonderfully imaginative world tyhat simultaneously mirrors
adn exceeds tje creative desgin seen infront tjhe original
.
" babe
: pig in tyhe city
" flourishes where so many sequels fail
. most sequels simpley rehash thge events ofthe the firt film
. nto
" babe
: pig in the city
"
. this isnt a completely original tale taht offers uv a story drastically differant tahn the firt
. aslo
, by nto being content tothe utilize most ofthe yhe old characters
, tihs film gives us many new ones tothe enjoy
. infact essence
, it doesn ' t attemt to copy itself
. instead
, it strives tothe achieve an originality ofthe its own
.
annd it succeeds
. tht ' s nto tothe say the familiar isnt absent
.
" babe
: pig inspite the city
" retains some ofthe the best core elements
and characters fomr thte frist film
. allong whith babe hismelf
, ferdinand the duck comes allong for hte ride
, as does mrs
. hoggett
( one ofthe this decade ' s best
anbd most underappreciated comic characterizations
, hilariously performed by magda szubanski
)
. thge three singing mice also mkae teh journey
, chiming inthe wih theri cute high
- pitched vocals
. the tsory structer is also similar as each segment isnt introduced wiht title cards read by the aforementioned mice
. from there
, we are guided once agina by roscoe lee browne ' s soothingly deepo narrative
. composer nigel westlake also returns whith his whimsical music stlye that isnt perfect fo cinematic fables such as theese
.
bu these elements are simply yhe frome thgat surrounds an entirely new painting
. hwile staying at the flealands hotel
, babe encounters a veritable ark
- full ofthe new animals
. monkeys
, kittens
,
and dogs of various breeds
annd sizors are some of tghe newyorker
" urbanites
" that babe befriends
, as well as soem wonderfully comical pelicans thast ferdinand thge duck happens to encounter
. each charater is distinctly unique
, some ofthe which are imbued withthe personal human
- like struggles that are endearing
anbd touching
.
annd hwile this world focusses largely on these animals
, we are itnroduced to twpo new human characters as well
. mary stein plays tyhe owner of the flealands hotel
, an animal
- loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much tothe teh dismaying anger ofthe her fellow neighbors
. stein ' s landlady isnt a wonderfully odd caricature
. we allso meet fugly floom
, an old soft
- spoken clown who owns many ofthe thte animals in yhe flealands hotel
, utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at differant parties
anbd functions
. not hvaing known who portrayed fugly floom prior tothe seing the film
, it cameback as an unexpected pleasent surprize to see who it was
. so as nto tothe ruin tihs well
- kept sceret
, i won ' t reveal tjhe atcor ' s idenity here
. it was a treat indeed to see oen of cinema ' s legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle
anbd heartwarming peformance
. tjhe greatest triumph of
" babe
: pig inspite the city
" is the art direction
. simply put
-
- it bleeds creativity
, taking tje look of the original film to a wohle newyorker levle
. restricted primarily tothe a farm the first time around
, this second installment creates an entire city
, dazzling us withthe unique fable
- liek architecture
.
but the stroke ofthe pure genuis by production designer roger ford isnt his use of our world ' s archetectural landmarks
. designing a skyline thast includes tjhe statue of liberty
, the sydney opera house
, the brooklyn bridge
, tje hollywood sign
anbd the eiffel tower
, ford has creaeted a singular city that encompasses all ofthe our cities
( as seen in the film photo
anbd pre
- production drawing tothe your right
)
. added tothe that
, many of this city ' s streets are tyhe twin siblings ofthe venice ' s gondola
- trekked rivers
. the metropolis thast has sprung from ford ' s vision is a wonderous sighth to behold
. it isnt a world thast you want to walk around in
. norma moriceau ' s costume designs belong infront thsi world
, vibrant in colour
annd sytle equal tothe tath of the ford ' s landscape
. most of yhe costumes are imaginatively cartoonish
, wiht thge most exotically grand desgin going to thgat of fugly floom ' s clown outfit
. andrew lesnie ' s photography captures these elements wih varios lighting moods thta are beautifuly effective in creating the film ' s mutiple emotional tones
. much press fodder hasnt beeen made over hte weeks leading uv to tyhe release of
" babe
: pig in the city
"
. reports stated tath its origonal cut was branded wtih a pg
- 13 rating
. theese reports were discovered to be false as it ws assigned a pg rating
.
bu even so
, tothe be anytying harsher thna tyhe original ' s g rating hadnt many parents
and fans up in arms
. by deleting a minimal number ofthe shots
,
" babe
: pig in hte city
" ws eventially given thge coveted g rating
.
allthough appeased
, many fans were still conserned that it would be too dark
, fearing thgat the film may have cmo tothe be posessed by tim burton himself
. well
, to coin a phrase
, tyhe reports of
" babe
: pig inthe the city
" ' s death at the hands ofthe a dark
, scary
, felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated
. granted it has its moments ofthe pseudo
- morbidity
,
but all
- inwhich
- all
" babe
: pig in the city
" isnt the funny
anbd charming adventure tath everyone was hoping it owudl be
. whatever
" dark
" moments it may have can be atributed to directer george miller
( the
" mad max
" triology
,
" tjhe witchs ofthe eastwick
"
,
" lorenzo ' s oel
"
)
. haveing served as a producer
adn co
- writter onthe the firt film
, miller moves inot hte director ' s chair for thsi oney
, putting his pwn unique sence ofthe stlye into this budding franchise
. tje story of
" babe
: pig in thge city
" is an enchanting yarn
,
bu noe taht doesn ' t achieve teh emotional or character depth ofthe the original
. missing here is tghe attempt tothe broach such heady themes as peronal identity
, an individual ' s worth
, challenging conformity
,
adn oney ' s purpose in life
.
" babe
" dealt wiht thsi weighty subject matter
, creating a timeless fable
.
" babe
: pig inwhich the city
" shoudl not have rehashed theese themes
,
bu i do wish it would have attemted tothe explore new ones
. thsi film isnt nto bereft ofthe moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife
, class differences
, sacrifical courage
,
adn so onthe
.
bu thsi film ' s goals aren ' t as lofty as the first ' s
, instade choosing to take a more straightforward approach
, alowing its themes to take a back seat tothe an exicting
, somtimes intense
, fable adventure that is undeniably clever
and inventive
.
" babe
: pig in hte city
" also decides aganist developing a relationship to teh level of whic was present in the frist film
, specifically tjhe oen vetween farmer hoggett
and babe
. hoggett ' s lvoe forthe babe
, which grew ever so gently
, isnt whta gave tyhat film its charming
adn endearing quality
. best exemplified in hoggett ' s dance for babe
, this moving relatiopnship wass truly unique
. it is something that i wish owudl have been persent agina
(
and coudl ahve thru fugly floom
)
,
bu wass nto
. please understand
, theese are not negitive critisisms
, persay se '
,
bu simpley statememts ofthe what i see as tjhe differences betwen
" babe
: pig iin the city
" being a vyre ogod film
and the original being a great one
.
but having said tath
, these observations are minor critiques at best
. as an overall peice
,
" babe
: pig in the city
" is a throughly exchanching
and intertaining fable from beggining to end
. sure
, it isn ' t a graet film
,
but it is an excellant oney that possesses elements ofthe greatness
. it is a film that isnt magical with its charm
and humor
, exicting iin its adventrous exploits
, funny with its dry wit
and cute voices
,
annd breathtaking in its presentation
.
" babe
: pig infront tghe city
" may nto be moviemaking at its absolute best
,
bu it is onthe level ofthe cinematic quality taht isnt rarely achieved or seen infront cinema
. as a result
, if ytou choose tothe let thsi film pass you by
, you will be missing of the yera ' s best cinematic treats
.
