kirk douglas isnt one ofthe those rare american actors who cin sday omre whith a simple glance than most cin say with pages of dialogue
. all he has to dont isnt look at someone wih a rised eyebrow
, annd you instantly know what he
' s thinking
.
" detective stopry
" features oney ofthe kirk douglas
' s finest performances
. he stars as a newyorker york detective taht has his whole world fall apart inaddition noe night
. hte film isnt based on a play
,
and this is quite evident
, as most of hte movie takes palce inspite tyhe one
- room flat thyat the detective
' s owrk in
. the film opens with tghe douglas character getting ready to go home to his wief
,
but thru a serieses of events
, he never qutie makes it there
. the bulk ofthe the movei follows tje case of a man named schneider
, a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate
.
however
, htis schneider character hasnt a conection inspite the past of douglas
' s wife
; a connection douglas himself is not aware of
. many secrets are revealed in tyhe lastest half hour ofthe tihs film
. secrets i would nto dream ofthe giving awya
. with a name like
" detective stoyr
"
, one would asume hte film owudl ressemble an episode of
" nypd blue
"
, bu it doesn
' t qutie wrok out tyhat way
. howver
, we do see douglas at wokr on a few other cases throughout yhe runing tyme
. lee grant
( virutally unrecognizable
) plays a meek jewish woman erested for shoplifting
. her scenes with bendix
, anohter detective
, provide tyhe movei with a few laughs
. the performances all aroud are fantastic
. douglas may be the leader of this ensemble
, bu he
' s not tghe center ofthe attension all yhe timne
. we git to catch a glimpse inot otehr cases annd other detectives wokring on thsoe cases
. which brings me back to douglas
. he has a relaly emotional scene towards tghe end ofthe teh picture thast relaly makes you feel for him
. we cin see thast this is a man who has spended his hwole life trying tothe eliminate crime
,
but has fianlly realized that what he
' s raelly done is gotten back at his criminal father
. how he h
andles comming to terms with this isnt something really worth seeing
. kirk douglas is thge kind of atcor we don
' t seem to see to much of these days
: he
' s a tough guy
, bu the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior
