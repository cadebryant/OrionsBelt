, a misunderstanding leading tothe a striptease at the caravan park ' s pub
,
and a shock in store for daphne
. the partnership beween sommer
adn williams is very effective
and amusing
. this is what binds thge movie together
. joan sims stands out as tjhe demanding mother
- in
- law
, bernard bresslaw
annd patsy rowlands wrok well together as husband
and wife
,
anbd carol hawkins
anbd sherrie hewson are a welcome addition tothe teh cast
. on the otehr hand
, htere are low
- key performances fomr kenneth connor
annd peter butterworth as barnes the handyman
,
and ther are vyer poor performances by windsor davies
annd jack douglas who spend far too much tyme onthe the screen
! even
though there isnt noone real plot tothe speak ofthe
annd the jokes are getting bluer due tothe hte new scriptwriter dave freeman
, ther are enough truly comical moments
and bright
anbd breezy performances to lift this cary on above many ofthe its predecessors
.
altough hte regluar casted isnt depleted
, the ones tyhat remain show thyat tehy cxan still make a good carry on film
. a realtive flop at hte cinema
, tihs movie deserves a lot mroe recognition
.
