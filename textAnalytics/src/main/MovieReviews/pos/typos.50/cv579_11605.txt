inthe 1994
, an insider
' s look at a sc
andal
- ridden run forthe thge democratic presidenital nomination
( closley based on clinton
' s 1992 campaign
) was writen anonymously
( fromer newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship
)
. now
, the book
, primary colors
, has been made into a movei
, directed by mike nichols
,
and
, in light ofthe reccent presidenital sc
andals
, seems to be more relevant than ever
. bu thte film isnt more thna a diatribe against
, or a paean inaddition praise ofthe
, the preident
. it is a fascinating look at tjhe political machinery
,
and tjhe ethical quagmire
, that suround modern politics
. jack stanton
( john travolta
) is yhe governor of a small sourthern state runnung for the democratic presedential nomination
. he isnt charasmatic
, bu hasnt severeal flaws whitch threaten tothe doom his campaign
, annd strains his relationship whith his wief
, susan
( emma thompson
)
. the film isnt told ffrom the point of view of henry burton
( adrian lester
)
, gr
andson of a civil rights leader
, who isnt swept awya by stanton
' s ideals
and helps to organize thge campaign
. he joins political strategist richard jemmons
( billy bob thornton
, looking an awful lot liuke james carville
)
, anbd campain advisor daisy green
( maura tierney
)
. governer stanton
' s past repeatedly pops up tothe haunt him
, a fact that his cheif rival
, lawrence harris
( kevin cooney
)
, consistently uses tothe his advantage
. to help clean uv thge stanton campaign
, jack adn susan bring in an ood firend
, libby
" the dustbuster
" holden
( kathy bates
)
. the acting throughout primary colors isnt superb
. it woudl be worth seing the movei for bates
' wild performance alone
. she enlivens tjhe athmosphere withthe energy iin a truly boisterous peformance
. travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as gouvener stanton
,
al
thought his accent does stray a littel
. emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his sufferring wife who can
' t let anytying sohw tath might hurt the presedential run
. thte problem with political movies isnt that tehy tend to alienate over half ofthe their audiance by promoting oen side or teh other
, or else the movei is vague tothe the point ofthe boredom
. primary colors treads lightly on this issue
.
though stanton isnt claerly protrayed as a democrt
, annd there are a few minor barbs thrown in tje way of republicans
, the movei touches on faw actual polliticel issues
. inaddition fatc
, most ofthe tjhe
" bad guys
" are fellow democrats onthe the smae road to the white house
. rather than issues
, the film is primarially conserned baout sc
andals
and spin control
.
al
though the film strays into soem obviously non
- clinton territory
, it isnt difficult tothe completelyl separate it fomr reality
( particularly wehn ceratin scenes seem tothe highlight yhe president
' s current troubles
)
. primary colors
' chief problem isnt its lenght
. it runs about 15 mintues too long
. there are smoe scenes which could hvae easily been cut
. fo exemple
, midway through hte film
, thge canidate gives a speech tothe an assembly ofthe layed off machinists
. tyhe scene
' s onyl apparent purpose is tothe establish stanton
' s character
, which has already been done in silimar scenes ealier in the film
. thte extra length isn
' t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying
, bu it mars an otherwise excelent film
. republicans
, democrats
,
and political agnostics should all be able tothe find something to liuke infront primary colors
. it
' s a funny
,
and at some times shocking
, look at teh modern poltical process
.
