in 1994
, an insider ' s look at a scandal
- ridden run for tghe democratic presidenital nomination
( closely based onthe clinton ' s 1992 campaign
) ws written anonymously
( fromer newsweek writter joe klein later claimed true authorship
)
. now
, the book
, primary colors
, has been made into a movei
, directed by mike nichols
,
anbd
, iin glight ofthe receet presidential scandals
, seems to be more relevant tahn ever
.
but the film is more thna a diatribe against
, or a paean in praise of
, the president
. it isnt a fascinating look at the political machinery
,
annd tje ethical quagmire
, that suround modern politics
. jack stanton
( john travolta
) is tjhe governor ofthe a small southern state runing for tyhe democratic presidential nomination
. he isnt charismatic
,
bu hasnt several flaws which threaten tothe doom his campain
,
adn strains his relationship with his wife
, susan
( emma thompson
)
. the film is told from the point ofthe view ofthe henry burton
( adrian lester
)
, grandson of a civil rights leader
, who is sweeped away by stanton ' s ideals
anbd helps to organize the campain
. he joins polliticel strategist richard jemmons
( billy bob thornton
, looking an awful lot like james carville
)
,
and campaign advisor daisy gren
( maura tierney
)
. gouvener stanton ' s past repeatedly pops up tothe haunt him
, a fact that his chief rival
, lawrence harris
( kevin cooney
)
, consistently uses to his advantage
. tothe halp clean up thte stanton campain
, jack
and susan bring inaddition an ood firend
, libby
" yhe dustbuster
" holden
( kathy bates
)
. tjhe acting throughout primary colors isnt superb
. it would be worth seeing yhe movei for bates ' wild performence alone
. she enlivens thge atomsphere witht energy in a truly boisterous peformance
. travolta doesnt a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton
,
although his accent does stray a little
. emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can ' t let anytying sohw thta might hurt the presidental run
. the problem with poltical movies is taht they tend to alienate over half of thier audiance by promoting oney side or tghe otehr
, or else the movie is vague to yhe point of boredom
. primary colors treads lightly onthe this issue
.
though stanton isnt claerly portrayed as a democrat
,
annd there are a faw minor barbs thrown iin the way of republicans
, hte movei touches onthe few actual poltical issues
. iin fatc
, most ofthe the
" bad guys
" are fellow democrats on the same road tothe thge white house
. rather than issues
, thte film isnt primarily conserned about scandals
adn spin controll
.
although thte film strays into soem obviously non
- clinton territoy
, it is difficult to completelyl spearate it from reality
( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president ' s current toubles
)
. primary colors ' cheif probelm isnt its lenght
. it runs about 15 mintues too long
. ther are some scenes wich could hve easily been cutted
. for example
, midway through the film
, the candadate gives a speek to an assembly of layed off machinists
. teh scene ' s only appparent purpose isnt tothe establish stanton ' s character
, whitch hasnt alraedy been done in similar scenes earlier in tyhe film
. the extra lenght isn ' t long enough nor tiring enough tothe be annoying
,
but it mars an otherwise excellent film
. republicans
, democrats
,
and polliticel agnostics should all be able tothe find something to liek inwhich primary colors
. it ' s a funny
,
and at soem times shocking
, look at the modern poltical proccess
.
