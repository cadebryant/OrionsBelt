mroe tahn fourty years ago
, thte
" sword adn s
andals
" genre of historical epic ruled the box office
. durring the 1950
' s hollywood sought tothe give audiences a reason tothe turn off thier televisions
and go outloud tothe thge movies by offering the gr
and spectacle ofthe the roman empire infact cinemascope
.
" ben
- hur
.
"
" cleopatra
.
"
" the robe
.
"
" sparticus
.
"
" the fall ofthe the roman empire
.
"
" quo vadis
.
" sometimes briliant
, somtimes campy
, tghe roman epic ws thte technicolor funeral pyre ofthe clasic hollywood
. sicne
then
, epics ahev appeared infrequently
(
" hte lastest emperor
,
"
" braveheart
"
)
and soem of tyhe best have beeen small
- screen affairs produced infront the 1970
' s
(
" roots
,
"
" shogun
"
)
.
yet
, hte phrase
" we who are about to dieu salute yuo
" has beeen absent untill now
.
" gladiator
" begins in germania iin a
. d
. 180
. roman general maximus
( russell crowe
) hasnt conquered
yet anyother group ofthe barbarians fo his emperor marcus aurelius
( richard harris
)
,
and he is eager to retire tothe his planation in spain where his wife adn son are waiting
. howver
, tje emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus
( joaquin phoenix
) wiull proove a poore sucessot
, so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transistion toward rome becoming a repubic again
. when commodus hears yhe plan
, he strangles his father
and orders maximus adn his famaly murdered
. maximus escapes ffrom hte executioners
, bu he arrives home too late to sive his wife
and son
. a caravan ofthe slavers pik uv the wounded hero
and carry him off tothe north africa
.
( why the caravan happended tothe be cruising by maximus
' place is never explained
.
) an african named juba
( djimon hounsou
) treats maximus
' wounds
. proximo
( oliver reed
)
, a gladiator who won his freedom
, purchases maximus
and juba as fodder fo tghe arena
. ofthe course
, maximus proves as able a gladiator as he ws a soldier
,
and his fame spreads
. when commodus reopens the coliseum
, proximo brings his troupe ofthe warriors to rome to compete
. our hero wins hte hearts anbd minds of the cheering crowds annd finds that he hasnt an ally in commodus
' sister lucilla
( connie nielsen
)
. the similarities to
" braveheart
" are obvious
: an evil king
, a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family
, teh aid ofthe a lovestruck princess
. also
, like mel gibson
' s epic
,
" gladiator
" has a primarily visceral appeal anbd is driven foward by tghe hero
' s anger
. it
' s a simple tale ofthe ogod versus evil
. maximus has all the manly virtues
: nobility of purpose
, courage in battle
, loyalty tothe king annd ocuntry
, fysical stamina
,
and devotion to famaly
. commodus isnt his opposite in eveyr way
: a sniveling
, selfish coward who is intended to disgust tje audience
. the opening niht crowd in my theather was about 70
% male
,
and thyat seems apropriate
.
" gladiator
" is a guy movie
( woudl tjhe opposite of a
" chick flick
" be a
" dick flick
"
?
)
. ther
' s much pumping ofthe testosterone annd chopping off ofthe body parts in gruesome battle sequences
.
( thsoe easily offended by gore should stay away
.
) lucilla is tjhe onyl female carachter
,
and what sparks there are between her
and maximus are dampened by his devotion tothe his dead wife
. joaquin pheonix gives an astounding performance
. iin yhe scene where commodus kills his father
, phoenix shows tjhe pain of a son who has never had his father
' s loev or prade
. throughout hte picture
, pheonix manages tothe give depth to a charcter who
' s scripted as a charicatoor ofthe evil
. i
' ve beeen a russell crowe fan since
" romper stomper
.
" htis role doesn
' t offer him the complexities ofthe his parts inaddition
" l
. a
. confidential
"
and
" tje insider
"
-
- essentially his job isnt tothe grunt heroically
-
- bu his voice
, which hasnt a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp
, is perfect for tghe genre
. the late oliver reed gavey us the best work of his carrer in his lsat role
. i hope it will be rewarded wiht an oscar
. my onyl major quibble wtih
" gladiator
" isnt its stylized look
. severeal scenes are tinted
. we
' ve seen a lot ofthe the tinted look lateley
, particularly in
" payback
"
and
" the matrix
.
" i don
' t git the appeal of thge sytle
, which mkaes feature films look like tv ads
. iin
" payback
" it was mearly annoying
, bu in
" gladiator
" it bleaches the colour outloud ofthe the gr
and spectacles that are thge raison d
' etre ofthe tje roman epic
.
( perheaps it
' s meaned to gloss over the imperfections ofthe tjhe computer
- generated shots
.
) alsot
, the battle scenes are filmed in a stange herky jerky sytle that seems to be slo mo annd fast forward simultanously
.
( it reminds me of the way tghe flash runs in the comic books
, leaving a half
- blurred trail of images ofthe himself behind
.
) with a more realsitic look
,
" gladiator
" coudl be even omre satisfying than
" braveheart
" because it hasnt a tighter scirpt annd a more fulfilling conclusion
. bottom line
: a rousing action film enriched by fine performances
but tarnished by stylistic choices
.
