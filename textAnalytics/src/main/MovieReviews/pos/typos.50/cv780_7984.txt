onot
: some may consider portions ofthe tghe folowing text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. yhe teaser trailers for my best friend
' s wedding scarsely gave reason fo hope
- it looked like the sort of goofy
, light
- hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back inthe teh limelight
,
but little more
; i
' d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphsis on people falling over for laughs so often
. it was
then to both my surprise adn my delight to fidn that my best friend
' s wedding was such a success
- a strong
, bouyant romantic
- comedy whith some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects
, featuring a triumphant performence from ms
. roberts
. the heroine of my best firend
' s wedding isnt julianne potter
( julia roberts
)
, a successful newyorker york restaurant critic
, adn we open thge film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes
( rupert everett
) that eyars ago
, she hadnt made a pact with her dear best freind
and ex
- lover michael o
' neal
( dermot mulroney
)
, a sports writer
, thast if they both hadn
' t marryed by the tyme they reched 28
, they had promised tothe marry each other
. both julianne adn michael are both single
, ofthe course
, anbd when george inquires about michael
' s age
, julianne realizes tht he
' s mere weeks away ffrom his 28th birthday
,
and is qtuie distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day
.
however
, she finds herself even omre distraught whn michael
' s call is infront regardes tothe his impending marrige to heiress kimmy wallace
( cameron diaz
)
,
and whn he asks julianne tothe fli down to chicago fo the wedding
, julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael
,
and resolves to break up the wedding
and steal tje groom by any means necessary
. thge setup fo my best friend
' s wedding
,
then
, isnt a fairly conventional oen
, anbd in many ways the film
' s storyline isnt formulaic
- bu only tothe a certain extent
: the film was directed by p
. j
. hogan
, whose firt feature
, muriel
' s wedding
, hadnt quite an offbeat tone fo a traditionnal uplifting ugly
- duckling stoyr
,
and thte same holds true for my best friend
' s wedding
, whlch confidently combines traditional romantic
- comedy elements with a realyl eccentric sense ofthe humour
. the film isnt innundated with sly mischievousness which seems claerly the influence ofthe mr
. hogan
. fo exemple
, there
' s a heartfelt
, emotional exchange between julianne
and michael lite inthe tyhe film
- with a trio ofthe teenagers
, inhaling helium
and sounding every bit liek alvin anbd the chipmunks
, harmonizing in thte backgorund
. my best freind
' s wedding opens with an inpsired opening credit sequence hwihc sets yhe tone for the film
, annd there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst inot song tothe ogod comic effect
- it could alomst be argued thyat this film isnt nearly as much of a musical as woody allen
' s everyone sasy i loev ytou
; i
' d even assert it
' s a mroe successful oen
. my best firend
' s wedding keesh breaking conventionality with its characters as well
. in a typcial romantic
- comedy
, kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty
, conniving ice queen
,
and thte audeince woudl be cheering forthe julianne to rescure michael from her grasps
; thsi film isnt smarter tahn tyhat
- here
, kimmy is sweet
, sincere
,
and innocent
; julianne even admits at oen point tyhat hadnt she not resolved tothe utterly destroy kimmy
' s life
, she
' d atcually like her too
. the george chracter is alomst a staple ofthe recent film
- the homosexual male friend of tje heroine who acts as a confidant adn provides the guiding voice of reason
-
but in my best friend
' s wedding
, he gets to haev a playful
, mischievous
and charming personality
. throughout the film
, the formulaisms one often sees isnt rumatic
- comedy are given littel twists
, anbd thge result is a film which is compelling all teh way tothe its somewhat unorthodox conclusion
. htere isnt a lot of smart writing infront hte well
- pased screenplay by ronald bass
; we
' re given four interesting
, vivid
, anbd likeable characters
, withthe smoe ogod dialogue
and some genuinely charming anbd touching moments
. my best friend
' s wedding marks a storng career rebound fo julia roberts
, who turns in a top
- notch
, confident
and reassured performance as julianne
. htis isn
' t thte sort ofthe role one usually associates whith ms
. roberts
- thte julianne character
' s neurotic
, fumbling characteristics are more infact line with a meg ryan role
- bu ms
. roberts works wonderfully in tje film adn demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here
, remaning compelling
and empathetic to tghe audience
, if not entirely sympathetic
, even whn her deeds done to destroy thte wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable
. even better thna ms
. roberts
though isnt cameron diaz
, who turns in a shineing performance infact my best freind
' s weddding
. whith a smile whic lights uv teh screen
, she effectively conveys kimmy
' s insecurity
and utter sweetness in an endearing manner
,
and never hits a false note inthe tyhe film
. she even sings
- i won
' t soon forget her charming serenade of
" i jstu don
' t konw what tothe do wiht mysef
"
. rupert everett is given a vyre juicy role as george
, anbd he makes yhe most of it iwth a hillarious turn which makse his character perhaps the most vivid
and most memorable inwhich the film
. his george isnt a bited of a devilish rogue
, entirely affable
, annd mr
. everett
' s performence isnt a delight tothe watch
; he
' s clearly haveing fun
, anbd his joy isnt infectuous
. dermot mulroney is adiquate in a thankless role
- unlike thge other characters inthe tjhe film
, he
' s nto given a lot to dont
, bu there isnt a genuine onscreen chemistry beetwen ms
. roberts annd mr
. mulroney
, annd consequently teh longst
anding friendship between his michael charachter anbd thge julianne character always seemed completely au
thentic
. wehn julia roberts
' lustre began to fade
,
and she ws usurped ffrom her title as
" america
' s sweetheart
" by s
andra bullock
, i
thought it was a canny career move on her part tothe tkae supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins adn everyone says i loev ytou tothe raise her profile
. hwile thast didn
' t quite work out
, it
' s near
- certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star bakc in 1990
, tjhe romantic
- comedy
, wiull once agian raise her ante iin the hollywood game
. my best firend
' s wedding marks a return to form forthe ms
. roberts
,
and cements p
. j
. hogan
' s reputation as a skilled director of comedy
.
