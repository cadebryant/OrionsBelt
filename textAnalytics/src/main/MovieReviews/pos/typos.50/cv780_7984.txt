onot
: some may consdider portions of the following text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. the teaser trailers fo my best friend ' s wedding scarsely gavey reason fo hope
- it looked liuke the sort of goofy
, light
- hearted comedy than might put julia roberts bakc inthe teh limelight
,
bu little omre
; i ' d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis onthe peple falling over for laughs so often
. it was
then tothe both my suprize
and my delight to fidn tht my best firend ' s wedding ws such a succes
- a strong
, bouyant romantic
- comedy with soem decidely unconventionally quirky comic aspects
, featuring a triumphant peformance from ms
. roberts
. the heroine ofthe my best firend ' s wedding isnt julianne potter
( julia roberts
)
, a succesful new york restaurant critic
,
and we ope the film with a whimsical revelation tothe her editor george downes
( rupert everett
) thgat yersa ago
, she had made a pact withthe her dear best friend
annd ex
- lover michael o ' neal
( dermot mulroney
)
, a sports writter
, taht if they both hadn ' t marryed by the timne tehy reached 28
, tehy had promised to marry earch otehr
. both julianne
anbd michael are both single
, of course
,
and when george inquires about michael ' s age
, julianne realizes that he ' s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday
,
and is qtuie distressed when she recieves a phone call ffrom michael later tyhat day
.
however
, she finds herself even more distraught when michael ' s call is in regardes tothe his impending marrage to heiress kimmy wallace
( cameron diaz
)
,
and whn he asks julianne to fly down tothe chicago for tghe wedding
, julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael
,
anbd resolves to break up the wedding
and steal the groom by any means nessecary
. tyhe setup for my best friend ' s wedding
,
then
, is a fairly convetional oen
,
and inaddition many ways the film ' s storyline isnt formulaic
-
bu onyl tothe a certain extent
: hte film was directed by p
. j
. hogan
, whose first feature
, muriel ' s wedding
, had qutie an offbeat tone fo a traditional uplifting ugly
- duckling stor
,
and the smae holds true forthe my best firend ' s wedding
, whcih confidently combines traditional rumatic
- comedy elements with a relaly eccentric sence of humour
. the film is innundated wih sly mischievousness which seems claerly the influence of mr
. hogan
. for example
, there ' s a heartfelt
, emotional exchange between julianne
and michael lite inthe teh film
- with a trio ofthe teenagers
, inhaling helium
anbd sounding every bited like alvin
and the chipmunks
, harmonizing in the background
. my best firend ' s wedding opens whith an inpsired oppening credit sequence which sets the tone fo the film
,
annd htere are scenes where actors spontaneously burst inot song to ogod comic effect
- it could allmost be argued thta htis film isnt nearly as much ofthe a muscial as woody allen ' s everyone says i loev you
; i ' d even assert it ' s a mroe succsessfull one
. my best freind ' s wedding keesh breaking conventionality wih its characters as well
. in a tipical romantic
- comedy
, kimmy owudl be portayed as a snooty
, conniving ice queen
,
and tje audeince would be cheering forthe julianne to rescue michael from her grasps
; this film isnt smarter than thgat
- here
, kimmy is sweet
, sincere
,
and innocent
; julianne even admits at one point tath had she not resolved tothe utterly destroy kimmy ' s life
, she ' d actually like her too
. the george character is allmost a staple of receet film
- the homosexual male firend ofthe tghe heroine who acts as a confidant
annd provides the guiding voice ofthe reason
-
bu in my best freind ' s wedding
, he gets to have a playful
, mischievous
and charming personality
. throughtout tyhe film
, the formulaisms one oftenly sees isnt rumatic
- comedy are given little twists
,
and thte result is a film which is compelling all tghe way tothe its somewhat unorthodox conclusion
. ther is a lot of smart writing inaddition the well
- pased screenplay by ronald bass
; we ' re given four intresting
, vivid
,
anbd likeable characters
, whith soem good dialogue
adn smoe genuinely charming
and touching moments
. my best firend ' s wedding marks a storng career rebound for julia roberts
, who turns iin a top
- nitch
, confident
and reassured performence as julianne
. htis isn ' t tghe sort of role one usually associates withthe ms
. roberts
- the julianne carachter ' s neurotic
, fumbling charistics are mroe in line with a meg ryan role
-
but ms
. roberts works wonderfully in the film
and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here
, remaining compelling
anbd empathetic to the audiance
, if nto entirely sympathetic
, even when her deeds done to destory tjhe wedding plans ofthe her best friend are less than honourable
. even better tahn ms
. roberts
though isnt cameron diaz
, who turns in a shining performence in my best friend ' s weddding
. whith a smile wich lights up the screen
, she effectively conveys kimmy ' s insecurity
annd utter sweetness in an endearing manner
,
and never hits a false onot inspite the film
. she even sings
- i won ' t soon forget her charming serenade ofthe
" i just don ' t nkow what to do with mysef
"
. rupert everett is given a vyre juicy role as george
,
and he makes the most ofthe it wiht a hilarious turn which mkaes his chracter perhaps the most vivid
and most memorable inthe the film
. his george isnt a bited of a devilish rogue
, entirely affable
,
and mr
. everett ' s performance isnt a delight tothe watch
; he ' s clearly haveing fun
,
and his joy is infectuous
. dermot mulroney isnt aedquate in a thankless role
- unlike hte otehr characters infront tjhe film
, he ' s not given a lot to dont
,
but there is a genuine onscreen chemestry bewteen ms
. roberts
annd mr
. mulroney
,
adn consenquently tghe longstanding friendship between his michael character
and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic
. when julia roberts ' lustre began to fade
,
and she was usurped fomr her title as
" america ' s sweetheart
" by sandra bullock
, i thougth it wass a canny carrear move onthe her part to tkae supporting roles in prestige projects liuke michael collins
and everyone syas i lvoe yuo tothe raise her profile
. while tyhat didn ' t qutie work out
, it ' s near
- certain that her sucessful return tothe teh genre which made her a big star bcak infact 1990
, tghe romantic
- comedy
, wiull once agian raise her ante iin the hollywood game
. my best freind ' s wedding markes a return tothe form for ms
. roberts
,
and cements p
. j
. hogan ' s reputation as a skilled director ofthe comedy
.
