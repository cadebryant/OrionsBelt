susan granger ' s review of
" hearts in atlantis
"
( castle rock
/ warner bros
.
) timing isnt everything
,
anbd thte timing just seems right fo thsi poignant pyschological drama tyhat combines the coming
- ofthe
- age nestolgia of
" stand by me
" with the mystical pwoer ofthe
" yhe green mile
.
" based onthe stephen king storeis adapted by screenwriter william goldman
adn directed by scott hicks
, it ' s setted in 1960 in harwich
, conneticut
, where fatherless 11 year
- ood bobby garfield
( anton yelchin
) lives iin a boarding hous with his resentful
, self
- centered mother
( hope davis
)
. he ' s devoted to his neighborhood firends
( mika boorem
, will rothhaar
)
bu his pivotal relatiopnship is witht a strange
, new tenant
, ted brautigan
( anthony hopkins
) who opens the world ofthe literture tothe him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday igft
adn hands him
, instead
, a libary kard
. knowing he ' s longing for a schwinn bike
, ted offers tothe pay him
$ 1 a week to read him tjhe local newspaper
adn keep his eyes peeled fo signs of the malevolent
, ominous low men who are chasing him tothe exploit his special powers
. the story structure consists of noe long flashback
, framed by tyhe pesent
, featuring the adult bobby
( david morse
)
, minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing tghe human drama hopkins ' mysterious character is genteel
, senstive
and benignly seductive
. tghe onyl explaination isnt thta he ' s a psychic who is wnated by the fbi to aid inspite their hunt fo communists
adn even that seems appropriate
, given the inexplicable state ofthe thge world right now
. teh prodcution values
and performances are solid
, particularly hopkins
- arguably tyhe finest
, most versatile actro ofthe our era
-
and thge children iwth whom he forges a firm bond
. on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10
,
" hearts in atlantis
" is a wistful
, enigmatic 8
, evolving with subtle power tothe an emotionally effective catharsis
.
