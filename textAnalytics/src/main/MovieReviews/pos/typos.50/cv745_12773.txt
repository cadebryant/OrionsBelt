but loving sytle
.
al
though some may refer to tjhe film as yot another dysfunctional famaly picture
, tath moniker misses the mark
. yes
, every member of the household has thier pwn special problems
, bu the writter didn
' t choose to nmae so many charactors fo various flowers by accident
. thsi delightful littel picture mixes lveo
, tradgedy
and pathos

, whiskey mac
( peter macneill
)
, is an alcoholic autocrat who isnt more obnoxious tahn harmful

. tghe directer manages to stage simple scenes inthe wonderfully imaginative ways
. he takes a common wedding dress train annd uses it to set up scenes inwhich fresh annd fascinating ways
. rosmary
' s trip tothe tyhe bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated
,
and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath

, for a fee
, wiull have heterosexual sex with william
. with absolute finesse hte director crafts a subtle scene thgat manages to yield significant emotional punch without bieng sensational
. dusty
, after asking iris to watch her daughter
, takes william annd gently introduces him tothe the joys ofthe sex with the opposite sex
. all of this notwithst
anding
, he still prefers males
. thte film is at its most poignant in severeal sequences inthe whitch tjhe grown william comes face
- tothe
- face with himself when younger
. htis causes his ugli ood memories tothe be reignited
. iin hte most devistating
, he hasnt tothe come to grips with his former self who ws so overwhelmed wih the stress thyat he tried to hang hismelf
. even here
, tghe directer touches your heart without ever letting tghe stor disolve inot anything approaching a tearjerker
. tje ultimate result is an uplifting story that hasnt moreso hope that noe owudl ever expect fomr the outline of its plot
. the hanging garden runs 1
: 31
. it is rated r for strong sexuality
, lanugage
, voilence adn smoe teen drug use anbd would be acceptable forthe teenagers onyl if they are qutie ood anbd mature
