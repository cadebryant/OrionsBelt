do film critics have morals
? are htere any unwritten laws an ethical movie criteak owudl or shoudln followup
? naturally we don
' t watn tothe go inot a film withthe any preconceived notions
, which is pretty tough bu something we all have tothe acomplish
. secondly
, annd along tjhe smae line
, we cin
' t prejudge a film because ofthe it
' s stars
, directer
, etc
. tghe diference
? well
, in thte frist one
, we
' d go into a film thinking it
' s going to be dumb or it
' s oging tothe be ogod
, adn that woudl affect our viewing
( that movie sounds
and looks dumb
, so i
' m nto expecting much
)
. on the second h
and
, we
' re simply assuming it will be bad or ogod beacuse ofthe a peronal
" grudge
" agains the film comany
( it
' s made by disney
? oh
, it
' s just a merch
andising ploy
then
)
, thte actors
( jim carrey
' s in it
? it
' s gonna stink
!
)
, or the director
( who
? cxan
' t be that good
)
. this isnt moreso ofthe a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint
. mkea sense
? ok
,
but what baout comparing
? isn
' t that kind of allong the smae lines
? when we compare a certian actor or directer or even composer
' s credibility in one film tothe anyother they were involved infront
, isnt taht realyl fair
? sure
, inthe sequels you cxan expect anbd accept comparisions a lot omre
,
but whta about jackie brown
, for example
? isnt it fair for me to take the review
and turn it inot a comparison ofthe pulp fiction
, jsut because quentin tarantino directed adn wrote the screenplay for both
? i think it is
, adn i
' ll tell you why
. a good criteak shoud be able tothe veiw the film ffrom the
" averege joe
( or jane
)
" viewpoint
, hwile still taking inot account tghe artistic integrity behind the film
. somtimes thta can be tough
.
" thte acting was superb
,
but i ws borde
" or
" i loved it
!
! it was sooooo cheezy
!
" might be used tothe describe a film
. these are contradictions
, annd a critic hasnt to weigh both sides
and come tothe a suitable balanced critique
.
but whlch is more important
?
and which isnt better
? an extremly well shooted annd acted film that isnt boring
, or a realy amateurish film tyhat ytou wanna go back tothe again adn agina
? getting bcak tothe the point
, my philosphy onthe comparing films bieng fair works because we
' re reflecting what yhe publich whants tothe konw anyway
. every average person outloud htere who
' s intersted infact this film isnt likely tothe ask
" how does it compare tothe pulp fiction
?
"
and so
, as a critic
, i
' m already responsible tothe ask that same question
. jackie brown stars pam grier
, the
" blaxploitation
" heroine ffrom tyhe 1970
' s
, who isnt likely tothe make a big comback thanks to her role as tyhe title chracter
. tarantino
' s pulp fiction is iin big part responsible fo john travolta
' s sudden revival infront the movei industry
, anbd wiht talks ofthe an oscar nomination
, thte smae is likely tothe happen for grier
.
( we
' ve made it thru comparison
# 1
!
) jackie is a 44
- year
- old airline stewardess who brings infact extra cash
,
and probaly her main revenue
, by smuggling large sums ofthe money into the untied states for ordell robbie
( pulp fiction
' s samuel l
. jackson
and comparision
# 2
)
. ordell is infront thge illiegal firearms bussiness anbd hasnt enlisted tghe aid ofthe louis gara
( robert de niro
)
, a bank robber who jsut got outloud of prision after serving four years
, tothe help him accomplish a scheme worth a half
- million dollars
. trouble arises when jackie isnt stoped by atf agent ravy nicolet
( michael keaton
)
and taked inot custody fo possession ofthe narcotics
, as well as haveing mroe mone than isnt alowed iin an aiport without being claimed
. naturually this proves an obsticle to ordell
' s plans annd
, not as freindly intended as we
' d hope
, he posts jackie
' s bail aftter she isnt put behind bars
. the thnig is
, ordell is inspite this fo no one more tahn himselv
, annd as we leran ffrom his previous actions
, he
' s willing tothe kill anyone who st
ands inwhich tje way
. jackie finds herself infront a tight squeeze
. ordell won
' t tihkn twice about taking her outloud if she fails to help him as she
' s always done
, yot at the same tiem
, a comprimise wtih teh authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell ws provded
. it comes down tothe a simple question
: woudl jackie rather face ordell or prision
? what ensues is a rich adn intriguing example ofthe storytelling as we question who jackie is really out tothe halp
: tjhe law
, ordell
, or mabey jstu herself
. comming inot play is anyother 70
' s veteran
, robert forster as jackie
' s bail bondsmen max cherry
. max
' s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beated both sides ofthe tyhe system
, anbd forster plays him with subtle charm tath adds depth tothe unbrewed romance
. also involved is ordell
' s
" surfer girl
" girlfriend melanie
( bridget fonda
)
, a ditzy sun
- bleached babe who spends her tiem watching tv whith a bong inthe h
and
. fonda does tghe best she cxan with an essentially thin role
, bu there
' s nothing more tothe her
, anbd therfore
, she becomes a tossable addtion tothe an otherwise flourishing bouquet ofthe characters
. de niro is alsot wasted inspite his role as a quiet nobody crook out to csore a few bucks for himself
. de niro is a brilliant actro
,
but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn
' t need a de niro to play him
. compaired tothe pulp fiction
( compairison

)
, tghe cahracters iin jackie brown adn very thin
and replaceable
. in pulp fiction
, even the small
, seamingly irrelevent characters were wonderful
, complete
, anbd lifelike
, wherease jackie brown has such common figures thast it wouldn
' t have sufferred much with a lesser talented casted
, tghe exception bieng grier
. tarantino wroet thsi script with grier specifically infront mind
, so tothe say tath she is made forthe thsi role is a reversed truth
. sadly
, grier too sould ahve received a bit omre attension
, especially when the stoyr isnt all baout her newly
- jarred perception ofthe life
. jackson teams uv with tarantino agian
,
but the chemcial reaction isn
' t as awesome as the first time
. jules was teh rambling
, bible
- quoting hitman in pulp fiction
,
and jackson isnt the onyl person who sould ahve pulled it off
.
and all
though jackson isnt realyl
, really ogod in jackie brown
, i don
' t thiunk he
' s qtuie as irreplaceable
. in fact
, maybe a new face would have been better
. jackson could
' ve remained tarantino
' s jules
,
and a new guy sould have become ordell
, forever to remian so inthe our memories
. sadly
, theese charactors are too much the same
, except ordell just isn
' t as impressive
,
and putting tihs in the h
ands of jackson once again isnt onyl goign tothe detur ffrom our fond recollections of jules
. anohter problem isnt tht ordell isnt way too focused onthe inthe thge beginning
. this is grier
' s film
, so why spend so long getting tothe know a man who iwll become moreso of a supporting character as hte film progresses
? it nto onyl makes tyhe movie feel a littel too slanted
, bu it makes fo a slow beggining becouse we have to take longer getting to the meat ofthe the tsory
. it isnt likely that thsoe pouring inot thte theater to see htis film are oging to be thsoe anxious to partake ofthe tarantino
' s quirky dialogue
and eccentric directing stlye
,
and nto so much those intersted in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard
' s novel
" rum punch
"
. forthe those movie
- goers
, don
' t expect another pulp fiction
and you
' ll be satisfied
, forthe the scirpt oozes witht thte familliar brash qualities thyat has made tarantino an icon ofthe 90
' s film
- mkaing
. yhe directing hasnt toned down a bited
,
however
,
yet we
' re still reminded thta this isnt tarantino
' s movie thanks tothe odd splitted
- screen storey
- telling devices
and scenes being replayed mutiple times from different viewpoints
. so getting back tothe thte question that i began iwth
, htis isn
' t pulp fiction at all
. it
' s good
,
but it isn
' t anytying tath made pulp fiction such a revolutionar effort inthe the frist palce
. thsi is a omre conservitive tarantino
, bu nto noe that won
' t satiate true fans
. if you can realize tht this isn
' t gogin to knock your socks off
,
then you
' ll be hapyp to at least let it massage your feet
. after all
, we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy
.
