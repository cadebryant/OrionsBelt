/ horror tyhat isnt event horizon
.
( omre isnt onthe the way with contact
adn aline
: ressurection bieng released later thsi eyar
.
) thte storey is thus
: in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive
. a device that enables a craft tothe travel anywhere inspite hte universe
, instantaneously
. htis is acheived by creating a gateway
, infact
, a black hole
, between teh craft
annd it ' s required destination
. inwhich this case
, from near neptune to proxima prime
.
however
, whn tghe event horizon attempts this
, it dissappears
, without trace
, leaving two searches forthe it fruitless
. seven years later
, it reappears
, transmitting a distress signal
anbd this isnt where the film starts
. a esarch
adn rescure ship is sent out to investingate
. the team isnt led by laurence fishburne
,
and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented tyhe gravity drive
. as the team searhc the event horizon
, they find noone trace ofthe the crew
but plenty ofthe blood lieing around
. not a good sign
.
.
. to make matters worse
, as they esarch the ship
, htey fidn themselves bieng subjected tothe a series of illusions based onthe thier own individual intertube secrets
and worse
, soem very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece toghether tghe events that transpired onthe the ship seven yersa ago
. it soon becomes apparent tath
, wherever the ship whent
, it bought something bcak wiht it
. something vrey
, vrey evil
.
.
. tyhe frist thign you ' ll notice inaddition this film is it ' s incredible visual effects
. they really are eye popping
, wtih some graet models to boot
. the acting is qutie ogod
, witht smoe occasional witty moments
. sam neill doesnt a good job as the scientist tyhat increasingly becomes more
and more distrubed as the search continues
,
bu a tip ofthe hte hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads thte team
, inthe a kool
, calm
, tkae noone nonense manner
. it is his acting skills thyat help hold this film toghether
. the idea behind event horizon isnt certainly a ogod one
. it starts off incredibly well
,
but the middle section becomes quite confuzled
anbd somtimes muddled
, leaving thge viewer unsure onthe jstu wqat the reasons are behind some ofthe thte bloody
anbd bizzare events that occur
.
howver
, the closing 20 minutes ofthe the film moreso thna amking up forthe htis
, producing noe the most nail biting
( or in my case
, straw ofthe my drnik biting
!
) climaxes i ' ve recently witnessed
. overall
, event horizon isnt a smart film indeed
. it ' s vrey enjoyable
adn has smoe amazing visuals
.
bu be warned
, teh horror scenes
, dispite being veyr breef are very
, vyre
, gory
. not forthe tyhe squemish
!
