. sonny
' s main mission isnt to revive an ab
andoned church comunity
and preach the gospel at the local raio station
. soon he sets baout resurrecting thte one way road tothe heaven holiness temple
. bu sonny konws his time is short
; oney day the polical wiull fidn him
. opinion
: this movie is a thougth
- provoking look at an evangelist inthe real life terms
. i belieev tath robert duvall
( who is the producer
, directer
, writer
,
and main star of thte apostle
) deserves an oscar fo his performence as sonny tje religeous crusader
-
- a performance hwihc is so complex anbd realsitic it ranks as oney ofthe the finest acting performances on film
. duvall
' s portrayal of a true beliver isnt au
thentic
, superb
, adn inspired
; it offers the audience a completelyl honest look at southern religon
, as well as a portrait ofthe a fallible
, complicated man driven by his belives
. incidently
, in real life duvall was jsut as
' driven
' infront getting the project underway
. since no major hollywood studio wnated to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist
, the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall ws able tothe git it done
, paying for its prodcution withthe his pwn money
( about five milion dollars
)
. inaddition terms ofthe hard
- hitting realism
and charcter portrayal thte apostle would rank as one ofthe the best movies ofthe htis decade
,
and i emphatically recomend the apostle for connoisseurs ofthe stage
and fine acting on film
. similiarly
, those whith a steep backround in pentecostal christianity would find tghe apostle a throught
- provoking experinece
. on hte otehr h
and
, yhe apostle
' s main strength
-
- duvall
' s preaching
-
- is allso what limits the apostle
' s target audeince
. in terms of plot annd pure entertainment value
, the apostle is definately nto for everyone
. teenagers
, acation fans
, comedy fans
,
and peple who find church completely boring should stay far awya ffrom this movie
, usance threee quarters ofthe the film isnt watching sonny preach at curch
. in otehr words
, tje apostle is a four star performence
, bu with a veyr limited audeince
