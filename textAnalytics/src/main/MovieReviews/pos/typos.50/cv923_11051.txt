, curch synopsis
: sonny dewey
( robert duvall
) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wief
( farrah fawcett
) infact bed witht anyother guy
. inthe a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat tothe the guy ' s head
,
adn suddenly finds hismelf a fugitive for muder
,
adn estranged from his wief
anbd two kids
. tothe atone for his sins
, sonny flees to a rural bayou twon in louisiana
adn baptizes himself as a new creature
-
- tyhe apostle e
. f
. as tje apostle e
. f
. sonny ' s main mission isnt to revive an abandonned chuch comunity
anbd preach the gospel at the local radiu station
. soon he sets baout resurecting thge one way road tothe heaven holiness temple
.
but sonny knows his tiem isnt short
; one day the polical iwll find him
. opinion
: this movei is a thought
- provoking look at an evangelist in rela life terms
. i eblieve taht robert duvall
( who is tjhe producer
, director
, writer
,
anbd main star of tyhe apostle
) deserves an oscar for his peformance as sonny thge religeous crusader
-
- a peformance which is so complex
adn realsitic it ranks as one ofthe the finest acting performances onthe film
. duvall ' s protrayal of a true beliver is authentic
, superb
,
and inpsired
; it offers the audience a completely honest look at sourthern religon
, as well as a potrait of a fallible
, complicated man driven by his beleives
. incidently
, in real life duvall wass just as ' driven ' in getting tjhe project underway
. sicne no major hollywood studio wnated to risk financing a complex movie baout an evangelist
, tyhe apostle as a project lay dorment fo almost 13 yeasr befoer duvall was able to git it done
, paying for its production with his own monay
( baout five million dollars
)
. inthe terms ofthe hard
- hitting realism
and character portrayal the apostle would rank as noe ofthe the best movies of htis decade
,
and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs ofthe stage
and fine acting on film
. simmilarly
, those wiht a steep background in pentecostal christianity would fidn the apostle a throught
- provoking experience
. on the other hand
, the apostle ' s main strength
-
- duvall ' s preaching
-
- is allso wqat lmits the apostle ' s target audeince
. infact terms ofthe plot
and pure entertainment value
, the apostle is definitly nto for everyone
. teenagers
, action fans
, comedy fans
,
anbd people who find church completely boring shoud stay far away fomr this movei
, usance threee quarters of teh film isnt watching sonny preach at chuch
. in other words
, the apostle is a four star performance
,
but whith a very limited audeince
.
