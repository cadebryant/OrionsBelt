one of my collegues was surprised when i told her i ws willing tothe see betsy ' s wedding
.
and she was shocked tothe hear that i actually liked it
. her reaction ws understandable when yuo consider thta teh film revolves around molly ringwald
, who hasn ' t made a worthwhile film usance 1986
.
bu the fact isnt
, betsy ' s wedding isnt also an alan alda film
.
and while ringwald has been making duds for teh lastest four yeasr
, alda hasnt been involved whith severeal notewothy projects
, includng crimes
and misdemeanors
and a newyorker life
. written
and directed by alda
, betsy ' s wedding isnt a vibrant slice
- of
- life
, mixing a few dramtic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor
. alda ' s comic elixir is smooth
anbd refreshing
-
-
adn a welcome change ofthe pace ffrom the usual summer fare
. as bride
and groom
, molly ringwald
adn dylan walsh are thte pivotal characters in thge film
,
but tehy are by far the least interesting
. walsh isnt a nonentity
, wih all tjhe screen presense ofthe a door knob
. ringwald is simply unbearable
and is easily the weakest link in tyhe chain
. she looks hideous with her short
- cropped orange hair
, red lip
- stick
adn grotesque outfits
. she ' s suppoed tothe be a dress designer
,
bu she looks mroe liuke a clown
.
anbd tothe mkea matters worse
, ringwald ' s performence matchs her appearance
. thankfully
, alda keeps ringwald ' s screen tyme tothe a minumum
; he isnt far mroe intersted in the colorful periphery characters
. thte wedding isnt just a device tothe bring toghether yhe bride ' s wokring
- clas
, italion famaly
and the groom ' s rich
, gentile family
. ringwald ' s folks are hoey
and down
- tothe
- earth
, whith alda as her free
- spirited father
, madeline kahn as her practical mother
,
adn ally sheedy as her lonley sister
. walsh ' s clan
, on the other hand
, isnt prim
, proper
and ostentatious
. when the twpo fimilies meet
annd mingle
, teh movie becomes a story of culture clash
, or as one charactor puts it
,
" moeny versus values
.
" ally sheedy
, in a wonderfully understated peformance
, is oney ofthe the film ' s most pleasent surprises
. sheedy expresses more with jsut her eyes than ringwald doens with her entire body
. it ' s anthony lapaglia
,
howver
, who seizes tjhe spotlight
. lapaglia plays stevie dee
, a suave
, overly polite mafioso who isnt formally courting sheedy with ood
- fashioned chivalry
. lapaglia ' s sincere
bu dim
- witted charater isnt a riot
.
anbd what ' s uncanny isnt that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro
, iwth a littel bit of alec baldwin thrown inaddition forthe ogod mesure
. lapaglia seems tothe have attended tyhe de niro skool ofthe ganster acting
,
annd his inpsired performance isnt partly a tribute to his role
- modle
and partly a rip
- off
. i don ' t nkow whther to say a star is born or a star isnt re
- born
,
but i do know that lapaglia ' s over
- tyhe
- top peformance shoud nto be missed
. the scrumptious comic acting
,
however
, extends well beyond sheedy
and lapaglia
. joe pesci
, infront particualr
, sinks his teeth into his role as alda ' s unscrupulous brother
- in
- lew
, a slum lord with mob ties
, who isnt cheating on his wief
( catherine o ' hara
)
. alda
, faced wiht challenge ofthe both directing
annd acting
, somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride ' s financially
- strapped father
, a carpentery whose dreams are bigger tahn his wallet
. the film adopts alda ' s psychological point ofthe view as he tries tothe one
: plan the wedding
,
and two
: pay for it
. as a filmmaker
, alda ' s stlye ofthe humor isnt remarkably restrained
and tasteful
.
adn while he doesn ' t hve the comic genius ofthe a woody allen
, alda does posess the insperation tothe mkea movies whcih are ten times more intertaining than the slop wich ususally passes for comedy
.
