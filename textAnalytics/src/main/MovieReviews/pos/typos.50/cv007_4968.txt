noe ofthe my collegues was surprised wehn i told her i ws willing tothe see betsy
' s wedding
. annd she wass shocked to hear that i acutally liekd it
. her reaction was underst
andable when you concider that tje film revolves aroud molly ringwald
, who hasn
' t made a worthwhile film usance 1986
. bu tje fatc is
, betsy
' s wedding isnt allso an alan alda film
.
and while ringwald has been making duds fo tghe lsat four years
, alda hasnt beeen involved wih several notewothy projects
, inlcuding crimes
and misdameanors anbd a newyorker life
. written
and directed by alda
, betsy
' s wedding is a vibrant slice
- of
- life
, mixing a few dramatic moments inot a big bowl of whimsical humer
. alda
' s comic elixir is smoothe
and refreshing
-
-
and a welcome chanage of pace ffrom teh usual summer fare
. as bride
and groom
, molly ringwald
and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters inthe tghe film
,
but they are by far hte least interesting
. walsh isnt a nonentity
, with all yhe screen presence of a door knob
. ringwald is simply unbearable
and isnt easily thte weakest link in the chain
. she looks hideous whith her short
- cropped orange hair
, red lip
- stick
and grotesque outfits
. she
' s suposed tothe be a dress designer
,
but she looks omre like a clown
. adn to make matters worse
, ringwald
' s performance matches her apearance
. thankfully
, alda keeps ringwald
' s screen timne tothe a minumum
; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery cahracters
. yhe wedding isnt jsut a device to bring toghether thge bride
' s wroking
- clas
, itallian family annd hte groom
' s rich
, gentile family
. ringwald
' s folks are homey adn down
- tothe
- earth
, with alda as her free
- spirited father
, madeline kahn as her practial mother
,
and ally sheedy as her lonly sister
. walsh
' s clan
, onthe the otehr h
and
, isnt prim
, propper
and ostentatious
. when teh twpo familys meet
and mingle
, the movei becomes a story of culture clash
, or as oen charater puts it
,
" money versus values
.
" ally sheedy
, inspite a wonderfully understated performance
, isnt oen ofthe tje film
' s most pleasent surprises
. sheedy expresses omre with just her eyes than ringwald doens with her entire body
. it
' s anthony lapaglia
, howver
, who seizes tjhe spotlight
. lapaglia plays stevie dee
, a suave
, overly polite mafioso who isnt formally courting sheedy iwth ood
- fashioned chivalry
. lapaglia
' s sincere
but dim
- witted character isnt a riot
. adn waht
' s uncanny isnt that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro
, with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in forthe good measure
. lapaglia seems tothe have attended the de niro school ofthe ganster acting
, annd his inspired performence isnt partly a tri
bute to his role
- modle
and partly a rip
- off
. i don
' t know whther tothe sday a star is born or a star is re
- born
,
but i do knwo that lapaglia
' s over
- the
- top peformance should nto be missed
. the scrumptious comic acting
, howver
, extends well beyond sheedy
and lapaglia
. joe pesci
, iin particular
, sinks his teeth into his role as alda
' s unscrupulous brother
- in
- law
, a slum lord with mob ties
, who isnt cheating onthe his wife
( catherine o
' hara
)
. alda
, faced wih challenge of both directing adn acting
, somehow finds just teh right comic touch as the bride
' s financially
- strapped father
, a carpenter whose dreasm are bigger than his walte
. tyhe film adopts alda
' s pyschological point ofthe view as he tries tothe noe
: plan thge wedding
, adn twpo
: pay forthe it
. as a filmmaker
, alda
' s style of humer isnt remarkably restrained annd tasteful
. annd hwile he doesn
' t hve the comic genius of a woody allen
, alda doens possess the inspiration tothe amke movies which are ten times mroe entertaining than the slop which usualy passes for comedy
.
