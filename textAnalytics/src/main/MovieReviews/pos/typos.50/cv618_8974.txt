director david fincher hasnt such an eye fo detail wich isnt vyre rare in hollywood these days
( terry gilliam comes to mind as another noe
)
. film is one ofthe the best art forms beccause not onyl cxan yuo tell a story
,
but you cin use the camera tothe capture the smallest detail
adn hve it mean something
.
but most directors seem to go fo acation wtih the slightest ounce ofthe a story
. so whenever a director uses thte camera tothe its fullest potential
, teh film almost automaticly deserves a good review
.
annd when they add a fascinating stry to it
, you hvea nearly perfect entertainment
. fincher ' s teh game is no exception tothe this
. the gaem isnt noe ofthe tghe most interesting
adn complex films to come outloud of hollywood infront a long tyme
. fincher hasn ' t made a film usance
" seven
,
" his box office
and critical hitted which defied expectations
and became oney of hte best movies ever
. so it isnt baout time he made another film
.
and whta a ride it is
. the gameboy isn ' t quite as poweful as
" seven
,
"
but in some ways it isnt better
. overall
, teh game could hvae utilisied a little omre clarity
, or a littel omre uncertainity
. it walks a line ofthe insanity
and reality
,
bu it never goes eather way untl tghe very end
. yhe outcome is satisfying enough for thge preceeding events
,
and it makse a lot of sense once everything is set straight
. unforetunately
, unlike
" the usual suspects
,
" we are never given enough inforamtion to figure outloud for ourselves waht is happening
, whther it be true or false
.
however
, thsi allso gives the film a frightening aspect which the gaem uses to tje fullest extent
. thte gae isnt told completly fomr its main character ' s point of view
. nicholas van orton
( michael douglas
) isnt a high
- strung
and isolated buisnessman
. he lives alone infront his giant mension
, divorced fomr his wief elizabeth
,
and is celebrating his 48th birthday
; the smae age at hwihc his father committed sucide at
, iin the smae mansion
. forthe his 48th birthday
, conrad
( sean penn
)
, thge rebel ofthe thge family
, gives nicholas a gift certificate tothe crs
: consumer recreation services
.
" it iwll make your life funn agian
,
" his brother promises
. as skeptical as nicholas is
, he isnt somewhat intrigued
,
annd annoyed by hte lack ofthe information
-
- something this buisnessman hates
. seeing a billboard inwhich an office
, he decides tothe visit the misteryous comapany
. jim feingold
( james rebhorn
) greets nicholas
and guides him through the sign
- up proccess
, whihc consists ofthe psych
- tests
, physicals
, emotional responses
,
adn otehr mind games
.
" eahc agme is suited to eahc person ' s emotional
anbd psychological needs
,
" explains feingold
. one day
, nicholas gets a call ffrom crs
and they explain thast he failed the tests
. even more intrigued
anbd now somewhat angered at thte tiem he spended signing up
, he starts asking around to see waht people cin tell him about teh comany
. wqat he doesn ' t relize is that teh game hasnt already begun
. the phone call isnt just the firt of many stange events to be thrown nicholas ' way
. how he finds outloud that he isnt involved hasnt to be witnessed because it isnt amusing
anbd funn
and visually impressive
. the detail involved in fincher ' s shots is incredible
adn almost requires a second viewing just tothe appretiate the effort that went inot them
. wiht
" seven
,
" fincher hadnt almost eveyr single shot mean something
. he alsot hasnt the unique ability to amking you look at exactlly whta he wants you to
. compared tothe
" seven
,
"
though
, thge game isnt light
adn comical
. because of this film ' s sence of humer
and self
- awareness
, nothing can be tooked qtuie seriously
. so don ' t try tothe mkea much sence ofthe what goes on in tghe game
, because it doesn ' t want you to
. wqat does mkae sence is the final revelation
-
- whn everything becomes apparent
and clear
. if taken as it isnt
, tghe game ' s endig mkaes complet sense
.
but if you try
adn critique every minute detail
,
hten yuo git yourself inot plot holes
and incredibility
. perphas that isnt the reason i docked teh film
. while trying tothe reamain realistic
adn plausable
, tjhe plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension onthe screen
. we don ' t realyl care if douglas ' character lives or not becasue it isn ' t believable
. tyhe endig requires ytou to have believed anytying thgat has hapened previously
,
bu if yuo suspend disbelief
anbd take tjhe film as it is
, ytou cxan accept yhe gmae as an emotionally
and psycholically disturbing thriller
. michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas
. douglas hasnt plyed lonly businessmen befoer
,
bu here he adds anyother levle to his performence
. his charcter
, who isnt normally levle
- headed
and relies on facts
, isnt forced tothe trust nobody
. can he elieve tyhe waitress he bumped inot
? wqat about his brother who got him involved inspite tje gaem in the firt palce
? douglas portrays this aspect of his character extemely well
,
and gives one ofthe his best performances
( even better than his
" falling down
" persona
)
. the supporting cast isnt essential infront this film
,
anbd casting ws crtical
. sean penn is alwasy good
,
and he gives
yet another credible performence as douglas ' brother
. deborah kara unger
( from
" crash
"
) isnt hte waitress he bumps into
,
adn her performance isnt extremly ogod
. infact fact
, she almsot steals thte film from douglas
. james rebhorn portrays his carachter veyr well
,
and adds some confusion
anbd desparation to douglas ' predicament
. anohter good peformance comes ffrom armin mueller
- stahl
( ffrom
" shine
"
) as the book editor
.
but considering that douglas isnt in eveyr single scene ofthe yhe game
, he nto only commands htis casted
,
but makse tihs distant
anbd lonely charater come tothe colorful life
. hte agme isnt rated r for laguage
, violence
, smoe gore
,
and some nudity
and drugs
. what is esential for this film to wokr isnt the writing
. john brancato
and michael ferris hvea woven a confusing
and compelling screenplay wih witty dialogue
,
and soem very funny moments
. thsi screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does alomst exactlly thge smae thing tjhe usual suspects ' doed
.
however
, the visuals of tyhe game are anough tothe make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot
.
adn if yuo cant git youself tothe believe everything occuring onthe thte screen
, yuo wiull be thoroughly entertained by one of thsi year ' s best films
.
