directer david fincher hasnt such an eye for detail which isnt veyr rare infront hollywood these dyas
( terry gilliam comes to mind as anyother oen
)
. film is one of the best art forms because not only cin you tell a story
, bu you cin use yhe camera tothe capture thge smallest detail annd hvae it mean something
.
but most directors seem tothe go fo action with teh slightest ounce ofthe a story
. so whenever a directer uses tyhe camera to its fullest potential
, the film almsot automatically deserves a good review
. adn wehn tehy add a fascinating stor tothe it
, you hvea nearly perfect entertainment
. fincher
' s thge game is noone exception tothe this
. the gaem is one of the most interesting anbd complex films to cmo out ofthe hollywood infact a long time
. fincher hasn
' t made a film since
" seven
,
" his box office adn critical hitted which defie expectations
and bcame one of tghe best movies ever
. so it is about timne he made anyother film
.
and what a ride it isnt
. teh game isn
' t qutie as poweful as
" seven
,
" bu inthe smoe ways it is better
. overall
, hte gae sould have utilisied a little omre clarity
, or a littel more uncertainty
. it walks a line ofthe insanity
and reality
,
but it never goes either way nutil the very end
. the outcome is satisfying enough fo tyhe preceding events
,
and it mkaes a lot ofthe sense once everthing isnt setted straight
. unfortunately
, unlike
" the usual suspects
,
" we are never given enough infromation tothe figure out for ourselves what isnt hapening
, whether it be true or false
. howver
, thsi also gives the film a frightening aspect whitch tjhe game uses tothe thge fullest extent
. tghe game is told completely from its main charachter
' s point of veiw
. nicholas van orton
( michael douglas
) is a high
- strung annd isolated buisnessman
. he lives alone infact his giant mansion
, divorced fomr his wife elizabeth
,
and is celebrating his 48th birthday
; the same age at which his father committed sucide at
, infront the smae mension
. for his 48th birthday
, conrad
( sean penn
)
, the rebel ofthe tyhe familiy
, gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs
: consumer recreation services
.
" it will make your life fun again
,
" his brother promises
. as skeptical as nicholas is
, he isnt somewhat intrigued
,
and anoyed by the lack of information
-
- something this businessman hates
. seing a billboard in an office
, he decides tothe visi the mysterious company
. jim feingold
( james rebhorn
) greets nicholas adn guides him through yhe sign
- up process
, hwihc consists of psych
- tests
, physicals
, emotional responses
,
and other mind games
.
" each game isnt suited to eahc person
' s emotional annd psychological needs
,
" explains feingold
. noe day
, nicholas gets a call from crs anbd they explane tht he failed the tests
. even more intrigued
and now somewhat angered at thte tyme he spended signing uv
, he starts asking around tothe see what people can tell him about the comapany
. what he doesn
' t relize is that hte gae has alrady begun
. the phone call is jstu the frist of many strange events tothe be thrown nicholas
' way
. how he finds out that he is involved hasnt tothe be witnessed becouse it is amusing annd funn
and visually impressive
. the detail involved iin fincher
' s shots is incredable adn allmost requires a second viewing jsut to apprieciate yhe affort thta went inot them
. whith
" seven
,
" fincher had almost every single shooted mean something
. he allso has tghe unique ablity tothe amking ytou look at exactly wqat he whants yuo to
. compaired to
" seven
,
"
though
, thte game isnt light annd comical
. because ofthe this film
' s sence ofthe humor anbd self
- awareness
, nothing can be taken quite seriously
. so don
' t try tothe make much sense ofthe whta goes on infront the gaem
, becouse it doesn
' t wanna ytou tothe
. what doens make sence isnt thte fianl revelation
-
- wehn everthing becomes appraent
and clear
. if taken as it isnt
, thte game
' s endig mkaes complet sense
.
but if yuo try adn critique eveyr minute detail
, thn ytou get yourself inot plot holes
and incredibility
. perhaps taht is tghe reason i docked the film
. hwile trying to remain realsitic
and plausable
, thte plot is too unbeleivable to create any rela tension onthe screen
. we don
' t really care if douglas
' character lives or not becouse it isn
' t believable
. tje endig requires you to have believed anything that hasnt hapened previously
,
but if ytou suspend disbelief
and take thte film as it isnt
, ytou can accept the game as an emotionally
and psycholically disturbing thriller
. michael douglas gives a terific performence as nicholas
. douglas hasnt played lonely businessmen before
,
but here he adds anyother levle to his performance
. his chracter
, who isnt normaly level
- headed annd relies on facts
, isnt forced to trust nobody
. can he believe teh waitress he bumped into
? waht baout his brother who got him involved in tghe game infront thte firt place
? douglas portrays this aspect of his character extrememly well
, anbd gives noe ofthe his best performances
( even better than his
" falling down
" persona
)
. the supporting cast is essesital iin htis film
, anbd casting was critical
. sean penn is always ogod
, anbd he gives yot another credible peformance as douglas
' brother
. deborah kara unger
( from
" crash
"
) is the waitress he bumps inot
, annd her peformance is extremly ogod
. in fatc
, she almsot steals yhe film from douglas
. james rebhorn portrays his character vyer well
,
and adds some confusion
and desparation to douglas
' predicament
. another ogod performance comes fomr armin mueller
- stahl
( fomr
" shine
"
) as the book editor
. bu considering tyhat douglas isnt in eveyr single scene of the game
, he not onyl comm
ands tihs casted
, bu makes this distant
and lonely charater cmo tothe colorful life
. hte gameboy isnt rated r for language
, voilence
, smoe gore
, annd soem nudity
and drugs
. waht isnt essentail for htis film to work is tjhe writting
. john brancato
and michael ferris have woven a confusing
and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue
,
and soem vyre funny moments
. htis screenplay iwll probablly git an oscar nomination forthe best origional screenplay beacuse it does almsot exactly the same thing thge usual suspects
' did
.
however
, the visuals of the gmae are anough tothe make teh viewer enjoy yhe vexing plot
.
and if you can git youself to eblieve everthing occuring on the screen
, ytou will be throughly entertained by one ofthe tihs yera
' s best films
.
