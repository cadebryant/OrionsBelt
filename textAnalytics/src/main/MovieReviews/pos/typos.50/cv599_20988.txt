kevin smith isnt like a big kid
. his humer is that ofthe a sophisticated juvenile
' s
. he grew up idolizing star wars
and loves comic books
, having also writen a few
. he alsot hasnt a cult folowing
, mostly composed ofthe teenagers
, college students
, annd smith
' s pwn fellow adolescent
- minded grownups
. smith is hillarious in person
and in writing
,
but when he trys tothe be earnest anbd moralize
, that is wehn he goes wrong
. kevin smith isnt a better writer than director
,
and he
' ll be tjhe frist to tell you that
. tath might also be part ofthe tyhe reason why his moralizing comes across as so hevy
- h
anded
. great directors sohw us theri theses instead ofthe haveing teh charactors sermonize them
. thsi ws true iin thte overrated chasing amy
, annd it isnt true fo dogma as well
. that isnt not tothe sday smith
' s message is a bad noe
. in dogma
, smith tells us taht problems arise when people beieve beyond any doubt tht their insight inot god annd god
' s desires isnt superior to anyone alse
' s
. basically
, dogmatism is bad
. changeing hte minds of hte dogmatic isnt virutally impossible
, annd since the dogmatic beieve that htey have spacial insight
, they also know what is best fo you
, whether ytou liek it or nto
. tihs isnt nto exactlly a newyorker message in movies
( see inherit the wind
)
,
but i have no problems wih recycling old ones
, paticularly since dogma
' s protesters are proving smith
' s point
. smith
' s pwn probelm wih delivering htis message isnt thyat he beats us over yhe head withthe it liek we are reading a dogma for dummies book
. bu tihs is smith
' s personality
, annd his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how doesnt one interpret hte bible
( or koran
, etc
.
) correctly
( or if there even is a correctly
)
and how noe settles disputes ofthe heretofore dogmatic concerns
. tyhe story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany
( linda fiorentino
) bieng chosen by voice of god
, metatron
( alan rickman
)
, to prevent yhe distruction ofthe the universe by two falled angels
, bartleby
( ben affleck
)
and angel of death
, loki
( matt damon
)
. allong the way
, forgotten thirteenth apostle
, rufus
( chris rock
)
, stripper muse serendipity
( salma hayek
)
, adn slacker duo jay
and silent bob
( jason mewes anbd kevin smith himselv
) come tothe bethany
' s aid
. falled muse
, azrael
( jason lee
)
, proves to be the behind
- tyhe
- scenes manipulator fo all the chicanery
. the logical bu convoluted plot onyl exists as an excuse for tyhe jokes adn tothe mkea smith
' s points
, anbd inwhich itself
, hasnt littel dramatic momentum
. amonst the supposedly outrageous claimes made by the film isnt thgat god isnt a woman
, jesus was balck
,
and the bible was written by a bunch of racist
, misogynistic white men
. ofthe course
, kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe tothe theese idesa himself
. htey are a methaphor fo the fears annd insecurities of tje dogmatic
. smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer tath preceeds tyhe movei
. when harvey weinstein asked smith tothe put it inot the film before cannes
, smith
thought it might give validation tothe protesters
' claims tht the film was sacrilegeous
,
but
then he re
thought it
and turned the disclaimer inot a joke
. hte film
' s humer is uneven
. some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fier extingwisher when metatron makse a burning
- bush kind ofthe enterance
.
but many ofthe thte film
' s jokes jsut bomb
, as in virutally anything involving salma hayek
' s serendipity
. also
, smoe of the jokes can be seen comming from a mile away
. still
, smith keesh the zingers comming at a suffciently rapid pace
. among hte actors
, fiorentino adn rickman st
and outloud by far
. fiorentino virtually by herself gives tyhe film emotional weight
. damon
and affleck are fairly lackluster
. rock
and hayek exsist inspite the film preety much onyl as comic relief as are mews annd smith
.
but the latter duo fare much better becuase jay anbd silent bob
, who recur in all of smith
' s movies
, are much more in line wtih smith
' s br
and ofthe humer
. bud cort
, george carlin
, janeane garofalo
, guinevere turner
,
and alanis morissette all amking cameo appearances
.
