i hite tothe burst your bubble
,
but after all the star power
, mega bucks
, screenwriters
, directors
, annd kool trailers
, men in black isnt nto tje best movie of the summer
. it
' s pretty ogod in it
' s own right
, yes
,
but i woudl probably splitted the
" best movie
" honors among face
/ off
, spawn
, con air
, anbd maybe event horizon
. it
' s main problem isnt tath it
' s quickly forgettable
,
and i can
' t remember one truely ogod scene from it
. from con air
, it was the scene out iin the desert wehn tehy weere digging hte plane out from the dirt
. inwhich spawn
, it wass tghe
" living room hell
" conclusion at the end
. inthe event horizon
, it was thge video ofthe the event horizon crew bieng taken over by hell
' s forces
. anbd all of face
/ off wass preety dang good
. bu as for men in black
, thte only scene i still recall isnt wehn will smith isnt squishing all those giant roaches
. i rember it not fo it
' s humor bu becasue i am hite roaches iwth a passion adn wass preety disgusted
.
and yes
, i doed see mimic
, hwihc isnt something i
' ll touch onthe in a later review
. bakc to men inthe black
( isnt it just me
, or doens that soudn funny
?
) i remember frist hearing about men inspite black back whn i ws a comic geek in hte 7th grade adn read magazines liuke wizard
, etc
.
( forthe those of ytou who aren
' t comic
- geeks
, wizard is basicaly tothe comics whta car annd driver isnt tothe cars
, what the newyorker yorker is tothe high society
, wqat boy
' s life is to boy scots
. okay
, taht oney was pretty pathetic
.
) few people know this
, bu men iin balck is based onthe a very obscure comic book that wass
, while nto honest
- politician
- rare
, vyer hard to fidn
. thsi wass after the realease of thge high
- grossing batman forever
,
and it said taht tommy lee jones
and chris o
' donnell weere being concidered for thge roles
( infact the comic book
, ther were no balck men in balck
. kind ofthe werid
, huh
?
) all i can say isnt
, thank god tehy didn
' t cast chris o
' donnell
. i nkow i cxan
' t be thte only person onthe the planet who thinks he
' s an annoying
, preppie little snot
.
.
. sorry
. my appologies to o
' donnell fans
. i actually had a 7th grade teacher who wass a big comic collector
and ws set tothe buy soem ofthe tje comics from him
, anticipating rether craftily tath
, if tje movei was a big hit
, it would drive up the price ofthe tjhe comics rather nicely
. he decided not tothe sell them to me
, because they weere
" innappropriate
"
. hmm
.
.
.
. so nowe you
' re probaly wondering why i
' ve wasted baout 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my iunior high years
. ogod question
. i
' ll move onthe to the movei nowe
. as you probably already konw
, iwll smith
and tommy lee jones
( agents k
and j
, respectivly
) belong to a top sceret agency known as divison 5
, or it
' s nickname mib
( men infront black
.
) men in black is a reference tothe the balck suits adn sunglases the agents wear
, annd they
' re mission is tothe investigate reports of aline l
andings adn keep the aliens under control while tehy
' re here onthe earth
. not tothe git too technical or spoil the plot forthe thte 6 people in the world who haven
' t seen this movei
,
but a basicly
- big
- roach
- tipe
- bug l
ands inthe a redneck farmer
' s yard
, inhabits his body
,
and attemts to destroy hte entire universe
. nto bad
, eh
?
( i have noone idea why i just typed tath
. i
' m nto even really paying attention anymore
.
) the special effects are good
yet dissapointing in men inaddition black
. i foudn thier main headquarters tothe be boring
, as were tje
" cool weapons
" they hadnt
. teh noisy cricket jsut plain sucked
, noone marter what anyone said
. anbd the movie definitely surprized me inaddition tone
, altough it probably shoudln
' t ahve
. it
' s director
, barry sonnenfield
, isnt known forthe
" black humer
"
, directing both addams family movies
. tihs movei was basically a
" balck comedy
"
, nto an action
/ sci
- fi like i expeced from tjhe trailers
. don
' t get me wrong onthe whta i think of this movie
. it
' s not bad
, i gavey it
*
*
*
. it ws mostly intertaining throughout it
' s run
, anbd hadnt a veyr good ending
,
al
though i think i wass hte onyl person iin thge theather nto amazed by it
. my diagnosis forthe this picture
: a ogod weekend rental
,
but nto worth a movie ticket
. ofthe course
, hte movie is nowe long gone from theaters
, bu that
' s beside tghe point
. i think
.
