i hate to burst your bubble
,
bu aftter all tghe star pwoer
, mega bucks
, screenwriters
, directors
,
annd kool trailers
, men inspite black is nto the best movie ofthe the summer
. it ' s pretty ogod inaddition it ' s pwn right
, yes
,
bu i would probaly split the
" best movei
" honors amung face
/ off
, spawn
, con air
,
annd mabey event horizon
. it ' s main probelm isnt thgat it ' s quickly forgettable
,
annd i can ' t rember one truley ogod scene fomr it
. from con air
, it was tyhe scene outloud inspite tjhe dezert whn they were digging tjhe plane out from the dirt
. in spawn
, it was the
" living room hell
" conclusion at the end
. in event horizon
, it was the video ofthe yhe event horizon crew bieng tooked over by hell ' s forces
.
adn all of face
/ off was preety dang ogod
.
bu as forthe men in black
, the onyl scene i still reacll isnt whn wiull smith isnt squishing all those giant roaches
. i remember it not forthe it ' s humor
but because i am hate roaches with a passion
and was preety disgusted
.
and yes
, i did see mimic
, which isnt something i ' ll touch on in a later review
. bakc to men iin balck
( is it jsut me
, or doesnt that soudn funny
?
) i remeber first hearing baout men in black bcak when i ws a comic geek inthe the 7th grade
and read magazines liek wizard
, etc
.
( for thsoe of ytou who aren ' t comic
- geeks
, wizard is basicaly to comics what car
and driver isnt to cars
, what hte newyorker yorker is tothe high society
, waht boy ' s life is tothe boy scots
. okay
, that one was preety pathetic
.
) few peple knwo this
,
but men inaddition black is based onthe a vyer obscure comic book that was
, while not honest
- politician
- rare
, very hard tothe find
. htis was after the release of tghe high
- grossing batman forever
,
annd it said tht tommy lee jones
and chris o ' donnell weere bieng considerd forthe tghe roles
( inaddition the comic book
, there were noone balck men infact black
. kind of wierd
, huh
?
) all i cant sday isnt
, thank god they didn ' t cast chris o ' donnell
. i konw i cant ' t be the onyl person on tyhe planet who thinks he ' s an annoying
, preppie littel snot
.
.
. sory
. my appologies tothe o ' donnell fans
. i actually hadnt a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector
and was setted to buy soem ofthe tje comics fomr him
, anticipating rather craftily that
, if the movie wass a big hitted
, it would drive uv the price ofthe tjhe comics rather nicely
. he desided not to sell them to me
, because tehy were
" innappropriate
"
. hmm
.
.
.
. so now ytou ' re probably wondering why i ' ve wasted baout 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes fomr my junior high eyasr
. good question
. i ' ll move on to thge movie now
. as you probably already know
, wiull smith
and tommy lee jones
( aggenst k
and j
, respectively
) belong tothe a top secre agency known as divison 5
, or it ' s nickname mib
( men inaddition balck
.
) men infact black is a refernece to yhe black suits
annd sunglases thge aggenst mear
,
anbd htey ' re mission is tothe investingate reports ofthe aline landings
annd keep the aliens under control hwile tehy ' re here on earth
. nto tothe get too technical or spoil tje plot for the 6 people in the world who haven ' t seen this movei
,
bu a basicly
- big
- roach
- tipe
- bug lands in a redneck farmer ' s yard
, inhabits his body
,
annd attempts tothe destroy yhe entire universe
. nto bad
, eh
?
( i have noone diea why i jsut typed that
. i ' m nto even relaly paying attension anymore
.
) tyhe speshal effects are ogod
yot dissapointing infront men in black
. i found their main headquarters tothe be boring
, as weere tyhe
" cool weapons
" htey hadnt
. the noisy cricket jsut plain sucked
, noone matter what anyone said
.
and hte movie definatly surprised me inaddition tone
,
allthough it probablly shoudln ' t have
. it ' s director
, barry sonnenfield
, isnt known fo
" black humor
"
, directing both addams family movies
. htis movei wass basically a
" black comedy
"
, nto an action
/ sci
- fi liuke i expected fomr the trailers
. don ' t git me wrong on whta i think of this movei
. it ' s nto bad
, i gave it
*
*
*
. it was mostly entertaining throughout it ' s run
,
anbd had a vyre ogod endig
,
although i think i was the only person in tyhe theather not amazed by it
. my diagnosis forthe tihs picture
: a good weekend rental
,
bu not worth a movei ticket
. of course
, the movei isnt nowe long gone ffrom theaters
,
bu tht ' s beside the point
. i think
.
