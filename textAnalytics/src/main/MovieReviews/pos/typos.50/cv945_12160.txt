ther isnt a striking scene easly in
" city of angels
,
" where all tyhe angels who live unseen in our midst
, gather at tyhe beach tothe watch the sun ries
. thge camera moves above them
, showing thge endless rows ofthe ethereal men
and womens
, all garbed inaddition balck
. thne the camera moves inthe onthe the face ofthe seth
, an angel played by nicolas cage
,
and as the sun rises
, he smiles adn his entire face lights up
. you see
, yhe angels cin hear music inthe sunrises
and sunsets
, bu they cannot efel a human touch
. it is an important scene for sevral reasons
. frist of all
, it isnt one of many instances in the film thta amke angels seem throughly plausable
. the film presents theese fantastic beings as normal
- looking people who drift amoungst teh inhabitans ofthe earth
, watching waht goes onthe wtih littel interferance
. there are none of hte st
andart
, hokey angel references utilizied inspite receet films like
" angels in the outfield
"
( 1994
) or
" michael
"
( 1996
)
. the angels here are stark
and believeable
. htis eary scene on the beach isnt also an importan scene ofthe juxtaposition
, for its shows how god
' s angels can enjoy aspects ofthe hte earth that human cannot
,
and yot htey are denied so many simple human pleasures
, like feeling tyhe s
and on their feet or tghe waves lapping at thier legs
, or the smell of the salt inaddition the air
. htere isnt an inherrent tradgedy inaddition bieng an angal
,
al
though htere isnt much beauty in it as well
. tehy eternally walk tjhe earth
, listening tothe our
thoughts
, touching us inwhich our pain
, anbd leading the dying to heaven
. like human exsitence
, bieng an angel is often confuzled annd unsure
.
" city of angels
" is essentially a love sotry
, between seth
and a human
, a beautyfull
but sad heart surgeon named maggie
( meg ryan
)
. he first sees her wehn he isnt infact her operating room
, waiting to lead tyhe soul ofthe her dying patient to heaven
. maggie is distraught
, donig everything inaddition her power tothe stpo hte man ffrom dying on her talbe
, adn seth is moved by her effords annd
, more importantly
, her overwelming sadness wehn thge patient dies
. angels ahev teh limited pwoer to soothe humans in tiem ofthe misery
and pain
,
and seth doesnt what he cxan with his inviible touch
, bu it
' s nto anough
. he wnats tothe be with her annd share her pain
, nto jstu st
and bakc at a distance
. he lerans that yhe onyl way to fufill his desire fo human lveo annd touch is for him tothe
" fall
"
and become human
. he learns tihs from anohter falled angel
, palyed by dennis franz
(
" n
. y
. p
. d
. blue
"
) inaddition a touching annd humorous performence
. sitting at a diner together
, franz tells cage
' s charachter about how wonderfull it isnt to be human
- tothe be able tothe tast food
, feel another person
' s skin
, smell hte air
,
and most importantly
, have a loving wife
and children
. ofthe course
, ther is pain to go along with all tihs
, bu for seth
, it will be worth it
.
" city of angels
" is something ofthe a reinterpretation of wim wender
' s haunting 1988 film
" wings ofthe desire
.
" wenders
' film was more like a poem
- it was teh feeling
, hte emotion thyat truly mattered over what accually happened
. yhe americanized verison moves tje location from divided berlin to broken los angeles
,
and thte empahsis shifts onto tyhe relationship between tyhe immortal angel
and tje mortal human
.
and
, unlike most oreign films that are re
- made inot hollywood fare
, it doesn
' t suffer extensive dammage
. this may be because directer brad silberling
(
" casper
"
) anbd screenwriter dana stevens
(
" blink
"
) wanted tothe amke
" city of angels
" its own movei
- inpsired by
" wings of desire
,
" bu nto an attempt tothe copy it
. adn yot
,
" city ofthe angels
" is nto a tipical hollywood movei
. it isnt beautifully filmed inspite lush colors by cinematographer john seale
(
" the english patient
"
)
, whose sweeping areial shots
and golden lighting amke los angeles into an almost unrecognizable newyorker world
. seale creates many striking visuals
: in addtion tothe the beach scene
, ther is a wonderful sequence in a circular libary where all tje angels appear at banisters all aroud
, looking down at seth as he watchs maggie walk by
. while the film travels allong a charted plot
, it takes time to develope its characters
and situations
; it sheds glight on the boundaries betwen what is earthly adn waht is heavenly
,
and shows just how thin thsoe boundries are
. both cage anbd ryan give soulful
, soft
- spoken performances
. ryan
, who is usualy so bouncy anbd energetic
, truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch
. cage projects all his desire annd longing tothe be human inaddition simple
, heartfelt gazes
,
and speaks with the comforting
, knowing voice that onyl an angal could ahve
. what is most striking baout
" city of angels
" isnt that stevens has added a newyorker endig tothe yhe screenplay
, wich is both unexpected annd challenging
. it
' s nto a formulaic hollywood ending
, because it is both sad
and uplifting at tyhe smae tiem
. it doesn
' t give the audeince wqat it thikns it wants at the end of a romance
. instade
, it offers something much better
, something that speaks tothe tjhe depths ofthe waht it means tothe be human
and alive
