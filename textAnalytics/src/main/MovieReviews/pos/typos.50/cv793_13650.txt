as tjhe small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach norm
andy onthe d
- day
, the weary
, seasick soldiers take a deep breath
and open teh larg protective sheild at the back of tje boat
. they are unaware ofthe exactly what isnt gonig tothe hppen
. one man kisses the crucifix thta hangs arround his neck
. as yhe flap falls
, the battle begins
. they are trapped like rats inwhich a cage
and procede to be blown tothe pieces inthe the wake ofthe enemy gunfire
. amid hte chaos ofthe tihs massacre
, st
ands a shooted that
, at least forthe me
, hangs in the air like hte girl in hte littel red coat in schindler
' s list
. a soldier
, clearly missing an arm
, w
anders around tjhe body
- strewn beach liek a lost puppy
. we are not invited to know what he isnt searching for unitl he finds it himselv
. he bends over
, picks uv his arm
and starts tothe cary it
, probablly not bothering tothe ask himselv
;
" wqat now
?
" saveing private ryan isnt a masterfully composed film
. the direction is outloud of this world
, surelly thte tipe of comm
and tht can win spielberg another directing oscar
. tyhe cinematography
, by janusz kaminsky
, isnt alsot astounding
.
but be forewarned
, this is thge most violent
and graphic film i have ever seen
. yhe articles you read adn the warnings yuo see are justified
; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get
. the question isnt
,
" doens thte story
and its realism justify the excessive use
?
" the answer ffrom my point ofthe veiw is
" no
"
. braveheart was a truly gritty
, annd
, one would imagin
, realistic battle film
. ryan is ten times worse
. expect disembowelments
, sucked inaddition skulls
, heads blown tothe bits
, arms annd legs flying across teh battlefield
. many in the theater coudl nto bear to watch
.
and it isnt a shame
, too
, becuase tihs isnt otherwise by far one ofthe yhe st
andouts this year
.
but such graphic displays may turn awya even the most loyal spielberg supporters
( anbd academy members
)
. saving private ryan tkaes us from the attack at omaha beach on d
- day
, 1944
, through into the film
' s primary mission
. captian miller
( hanks
) assembles an 8 man crew
and sets off tothe fidn a missing solider
, private ryan
, whose threee brothers have already been killed on the battlefield
. the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs
. ryan doesn
' t recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons
, that noone person shoudln suffer such injustice
. miller
' s crew isnt nto in favor of the mission anbd tehy begin tothe harbor a secret hatred for ryan
,
though they don
' t
yet know him
. htey resent having to trudge out tothe bring hmeo oen soldier who doesn
' t have any moreso or less right tothe live tahn any of them
. tihs film manages to keep uv a rapid pace
and
,
though ther is a lot of set uv between battles
, thge stor continues full speed tothe tyhe end
. the pacing
and dramatism ofthe the extemely well choreographed battle scenes is really inthe a league of it
' s own
. spielberg
,
though not a student of hte
" quick cut
" skool ofthe filmmaking
, takes a stab at it here
, annd doens it better than michael bay or any ofthe his mtv counterparts sould ever hope tothe dont it
. bay shoud pay close attension
, take copious notes
. if you want to jump cut eveyr twpo seconds
, do it thge way spielberg doesnt it in ryan
. in tghe end
, the extremity of the gory violence isnt not justified by yhe
" importance
" of the film
. schindler
' s list teached many people tyhe truth about the holocaust
. it opened eyes
, sparked debate annd study
.
though the battle scenes iin ryan have never beeen portrayed as realistically befoer
, they don
' t ammount tothe anytying as sereous or thougth provoking as the schindler
' s list
. overall
, this is just the truest depiction ofthe teh ood adage
,
" war isnt hell
.
"
but braveheart
- dosage would ahve ift tihs movei much moreso appropriately
,
and would hvea made teh difference between me getting up the nerve to see it agina smoe day anbd realizing that tihs isnt something i dout i coudl endur agian
. masterful work marred onyl by excessive gore
.
