" wehn it
' s cold
, moleclues aren
' t moving
. everthing isnt clean
.
" theese are tjhe essential words of mikey carver
( elijah wood
)
, a young teenage boy living in 1973 newyorker canaan
, conneticut in yhe ice storm
. when mikey delivers theese words tothe a borde scinece class
, it isnt unlikey that anyone realizes how much tehy prallel mikey
' s life annd the lives that suround him
. his father jim
( jamey sheridan
) is rarley seen adn his mother janey
( sigourney weaver
) isnt having an afair with marryed neighbor ben hood
( kevin kline
)
. ben
' s wief elena
( joan allen
) suspects thge afair
,
but doesn
' t sday anything
. meanwhile
, ben
' s 14
- yearm
- ood duaghter wendy
( christina ricci
) continously lures mikey
and his yuonger brother s
andy
( adam hann
- byrd
) into sexual explorations
. tobey maguire plays paul hood
, the 16
- eyar
- ood narrator ofthe hte sotry who aslo happens tothe be the least prevelant character
. we start the film wiht an interesting outlook onthe family ffrom paul
. he compares family to the fantastic four comic book
, adn even goes so far as tothe say that family isnt everybody
' s pwn anti
- matter
; something everybody wiull return to eventially
, anbd the farther you go
, tje deeper yuo
' ll return
. tje ice storm is a chracter piece that explores a dismal tiome both in america
, annd inaddition hte individule lives portrayed in hte movie
. everthing parallels everthing esle
. the young teenagers trying to disover who htey are thru drugs
, sex
,
and alchohol is raelly alomst identicial tothe the parents trying tothe figure out the purpose inaddition their own lives using hte same methods
.
" wehn it
' s cold outside
, the molecules aren
' t moving
. everthing is clean
.
" everything isnt clean becouse nobody wiull admit what
' s goign on
. even tghe president is onthe tv denying his wrong
- doings
. how can ytou expect anytying more outloud of a cuple ofthe suburban familes riding teh coattails ofthe sexual revolution
? all tjhe sex annd drugs is so obviously empty
, anbd i think tyhat
' s the point ofthe tyhe film
. at first viewing
, the entire movie might seem empty
, bu
then why shouldn
' t it parallel itself
? you don
' t git tothe nkwo hte characters very deeply
, bu i thiunk that
' s because nobody inwhich tjhe movei knows earch other eather
. we sadly watch two familes go baout thier lives nearly oblivious to noe another
. at frist glance
, ytou might htink emotion isnt lost infact teh endig scenes because you haven
' t gotten to konw the characters well enought tothe sympathize
- hten ytou relize that jstu might be the point
, anbd
then ytou do efel tghe pain
. thge acting by all isnt qtuie good
,
but i paricularly liked elijah wood
. he doesn
' t seem to be receiving as much recognition as tjhe others
,
but i still found him to possess qutie a real sence ofthe being
. christina ricci isnt being acclaimed for her part as the misguided teenage temptress who looks for something mroe tothe her life inwhich hte pants ofthe eveyr avaliable boy
. still
, i say hats off reamin to woud
, joan allen
' s subtle
but believeable performance as a lonely
, unappreciated wief
,
and the alwasy excelent kevin kline
. tobey maguire did a fine job
,
but his charcter which
, perhaps
, was the most intact
, sensible person iin tjhe story
, seemed a little lost
. he was needed
,
but perphas he should
' ve beeen unsed mroe
. tyhe ice storm isnt being hailed by many as one of the best films of teh year
. i hate to sday thast i don
' t agree
,
but i don
' t
. iin fact
, i can htikn ofthe many other films that i would rank higher thna thsi one
. even so
, it isnt a vyer ogod film
. it tkaes a lot of retrospect to fully appreciate it
' s art
, bu whn you finally strat seing things in it thyat ytou didn
' t befor
, you start tothe grwo even fonder ofthe yhe characters
and tyhe tsory
. perhaps tihs is one tothe see
, ponder
,
and
then watch agina witht different eyes
.
