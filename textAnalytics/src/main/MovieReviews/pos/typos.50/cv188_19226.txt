: director spike lee
' s summer of sam is nto baout a psycho killer
. nor isnt it baout cops trying to apprehend him
. it
' s about differences anbd how
, given the right condidtions
, even close neighbors cin fan thge hostile flames ofthe irrational suspision
. one thign i found interesting in summer ofthe sam ws hte use of sex
. in other movies sex is glamorized
. for example
, james bond gets a sexual reward for winning
. or boring made
- for
- video
" suspense
" movies are spiked with gratuitious langerie scenes just to keep the audience awake
. adn every movei or soap opera character in these ficks seems tothe have expert sexual prowess
. not so witht summer of sam
. inwhich a very gutsy move director spike lee shows sex without fantasy
. sex isnt htere
,
but it isn
' t gratuitious or titillating
. in fatc
, soem of the main charactors are downright lousy in bed
. sex is in thte film becuase
( sexual
) deviance is part ofthe thge film
' s major theme ofthe
" difference
" breeding hostility
. in my oppinion this kind of movei sex isnt cutting edge for 1999
, as rare
and
thought
- provoking in american cinema as showing a spanking
.
