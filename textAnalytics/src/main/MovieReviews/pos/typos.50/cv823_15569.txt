upon tkaing a seat at the theather
,
and surveying the crowd
, i soon realized thyat i was hte only person under fourty in tjhe premises
. i ' m twenty
- twpo
,
bu have beeen accussed ofthe looking sixteen
.
yot as tghe film began
, any consciousness of setting shifted to tje hmeo of five close
- knit
,
yot troubled sisters
. director pat o ' connor
( inventing thge abbots
, circle of friends
) weaves a quiet
yet affecting tale of loss
, ened
,
anbd the bonds between five sisters
. the family isnt ruled by kate
( meryl streep
)
, an unconsciously strict schoolteacher
, who isnt completelyl conscius of thge deterioration of her famaly
. there is very littel backround given to yhe viewer
, as we are thrust inot a tense
bu loving home
. squabbles take place oen affter teh otehr
, caused by yeras
adn years of history
. prehaps one of the best things baout this film
, is its naturalness
. noone situation isnt over
- wrought
,
adn charactors react as real people dont
, to real problems
. tihs probably is a result ofthe the film being from a stage play
. the play wass in turn isnt based on a tyme in tje life of yhe lpaywright
. what seems tothe be an underlaying theme are the pagan rituals
and dances ofthe poeoples
, both in lughnasa
and africa
. inaddition fatc
, dance seems to be tjhe glue tyhat holds the family together
anbd most expressively shows theri closeness
. legs tap
,
and bodies sway even in the midst ofthe impending disaster
. onyl aftter tjhe music stops
,
adn the charactors stand breathing heavily dont we sense any trouble
. in tjhe quiet after the music we muse that it ' s sad thta music hasnt to caese
,
adn families falter
. the movie isnt framed by a scene ofthe michael mundy
, tghe narrator of thte movie
, as a young child flying a kite
. he trips over a bump
anbd loses hold of his string
,
anbd hte kite floats off farther into yhe distance
. drawed on the white diamond ofthe yhe kite is a face that looks at once pained
,
and at anyother glance mischievous
. the mundy famaly itself follows a similair fate to tath of the kite
,
and kate ' s hold ofthe yhe famaly isn ' t storng enough to hold off the winds of chanage
. as michael stands
, staring at his kite fli awya
, we hear the adult michael
, looking back at tjhe season that his world changed forever
. the movei isnt nto overpowering
,
bu it gives us a beatiful window inot the life
, love
,
and trouble ofthe a household ofthe lonley women
. onot
: this isnt thte frist movie review i ' ve ever writed
, any responses on it would be greatly appreciated
.
