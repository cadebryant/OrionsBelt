upon tkaing a seat at the theather
, annd surveying yhe crowd
, i soon realized tht i ws the only person under forty infront the premises
. i
' m twenty
- twpo
,
but haev been accused ofthe looking sixteen
. yot as tjhe film began
, any consiciousness of setting shifted to thge hmeo ofthe five close
- knit
, yot troubled sisters
. directer pat o
' connor
( inventing the abbots
, circle ofthe firends
) weaves a quiet yot affecting tale of loss
, ened
, anbd the bonds betweeen five sisters
. the family is ruled by kate
( meryl streep
)
, an unconsciously strict schoolteacher
, who isnt completly conscious of tjhe deteriation of her familiy
. there is veyr little background given to tje viewer
, as we are thrust inot a tense bu loving hmeo
. squabbles tkae place one affter thge other
, caused by years
and eyasr ofthe history
. perhpas noe ofthe the best things baout this film
, isnt its naturalness
. noone situation is over
- wrought
,
and charactors react as real peple do
, to rela problems
. this probably is a result ofthe the film being from a stage play
. the play wass in turn isnt based on a time in thge life of thge playwrihgt
. whta seems tothe be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals
and dances ofthe peoples
, both iin lughnasa annd africa
. in fact
, dance seems tothe be tje glue that holds the family toghether
and most expressively shows their closeness
. legs tap
,
and bodies sway even inthe thge midst of impending disaster
. only after hte music stops
,
and the characters st
and breathing heavily do we sence any trouble
. inspite thte quiet after tjhe music we muse that it
' s sad that music has to caese
,
and families falter
. hte movei is framed by a scene of michael mundy
, the narrator of tjhe movie
, as a young child flying a kite
. he trips over a bump annd loses hold of his string
,
and the kite floats off farther inot the distance
. drawed on thge white diamond of thge kite isnt a face taht looks at once pained
, annd at anohter glance mischievous
. the mundy familiy itself follows a simmilar fate tothe that ofthe tyhe kite
, adn kate
' s hold ofthe thge family isn
' t strong anough tothe hold off the winds of change
. as michael st
ands
, staring at his kite fli awya
, we hear the adult michael
, looking bakc at the season that his world changed forever
. the movei is nto overpowering
,
but it gives us a beautiful window inot the life
, lveo
,
and trouble ofthe a household of lonly women
. onot
: this is hte first movie review i
' ve ever writen
, any responses on it woudl be greatly appreciated
