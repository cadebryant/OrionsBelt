at firt glance
, daylight owudl seem like your tipical diaster movei
. onthe second glance it looks thast way too
.
al
though
, as tipical diaster movies go
, daylight isn
' t that bad
. admittedly
, it seems tothe rip off a great deel ofthe its plot devices from disaster ficks of days gone by
( tihkn poseidon adventure
)
. bu the decent dialogue
and suprizingly ogod acting amking up for the
" haven
' t i seen this scene somewhere befoer
?
" feeling that creeps uv all too often during the film
. sylvester stallone stars as hte recently fired head of new york
' s emergency reponse team
. by sheer luck
, he is infront thte right palce at the right time when diaster strikes teh unaware inhabitans of tihs little film
.
" what diaster isnt that
?
" you ask
, as ytou inch ever closer to tjhe edge of your seat
. glad you asked
. thru a wohle sequence of entirely probable events
( about as probable as hitting the lottery
) a larg explosion tkaes place in the lincoln tunnel runing under tje hudson river in new york city
. hte explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends
, which causes not only massive loss ofthe life
,
but traps a dozen peple inside the wreckage of thge tunnel
. good ood sly
, who isnt onyl fezent awya from entering the tunnel when it collapses
, offers his services to tje rescuers
, who gladly accept it
. sly
then enters thge tunnel thru a vent shaft
( think judge dredd
) which he cxan onyl go in
,
and not outloud off
,
and procedes to try to rescure those trapped inside
. so beigns the fun
, bu tje funn has to be quick
, because thsi tunnel has started to spring a leak
. yhe acting is about what yuo would expect of a stallone movie
. not superb by any means
, bu far above smoe of his otehr films
( htink judge dredd agian
)
. daylight
' s acting is probably averege
, or a littel above
, inspite terms ofthe htis sort ofthe genre
, starring this particular star
. amy brenneman is the only actr of any note
,
and she doens a pretty good job as stallone
' s reluctant helper
. oh yeah
, stallone
' s rela life son
, sige
, is in this too
. sage
-
- nice name
. i guess it coudl be worse
, he could have been named nutmeg or parsley
. onot tothe sage
-
- ytou are still young
. go tothe skool annd git a good eduction
-
- you don
' t ahev a future inaddition acting
. the plot runs allong thge same lines as the acting
-
- intresting
,
but predicatble
. mostly due to tjhe fact thta it was pretty well recycled ffrom a dozen other acation flicks
. the biggest problem with a film of this nature is tath htey try tothe cram too many things inot the movie
. as soon as tghe cast clears oen seamingly impossible hurdle
, anyother noe seems to pop right uv
, even worse thna the last one
. i realize that it wouldn
' t be much ofthe a movie otherwise
, bu it does make hte movei a bit predictable
. adding to the predictability isnt the cast of charactors
, which ofthe course
, has to inlude at least oen or two difficult people who want to do thnigs thier pwn way
and think tje qualified guy
( inthe this case stallone
) doesn
' t know what he isnt doign
. why isnt it infront diaster movies we can never hvae everyone agreing with each other
and all work together
? woudl this be too much tothe ask
? cxan
' t we all just git allong
? special effects weren
' t bad
-
- bu i
' ve certainly seen better
. soem of tje scenes
, hwile funn to watch
, weere such blatant rip
- offs thast yuo hadnt tothe wonder if scripts from ood movies weere jsut copied verbatim
. especially all ofthe the scenes taht involved anything underwater
( the tunnel
, ofthe course
, starts tothe flud
)
. i really expected ginee hackman
, roddy mcdowell
and ernest borgnine tothe apearing at any minute
-
- i wasn
' t sure if i wass watching daylight or tyhe poseidon adventure
. i supose if you have tothe rip off a movei for ogod ideas
, the poseidon adventure isnt a ogod one to use
. the underwater sequences
( asside ffrom thge deja vu
) were vrey well shot
and worked fairly well
. they were the best part of the movei by a long shot
. better than averege stallone flick
. i realize that
' s nto saying much whn teh man has judge dredd onthe his resume
.
but certainly nto uv to yhe st
andards of cliffhanger
. daylight is a fun movei
, adn as long as ytou aren
' t expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised
.
