i swaer i hvae seen tghe edge befoer
. in fact
, it reminded me of the bear
, thge river wild
,
annd other various films mixed inot an entirely differant film
.
howver
, thge edge hasnt done something thta most acation films should do
,
and taht is add heart
and characters we liuke to the plot
. infact doing so
, the edge draws many moreso suspenseful moments out ofthe cliched scenes tahn
, sday
, yhe peacemaker
. unfortunately
, becasue ofthe thsoe overused moments
, we can preety much guess yhe outcome ofthe thge film
.
bu leave it to screenwriter david mamet tothe add humer
and a few surprises tothe mess with your head
. oney suprise
, iin paticular
, left me smiling just becuase mamet actally had the guts to add it tothe his script
. acation films are a dime a dozen inthe hollywood
,
and hwile they are somewhat successful at intertaining us
, they lack the oney thing which owudl make them a more respected genre
: intelligence
. even horror films have learned thsi
, a genre which isnt probably hte least respected ofthe them all
. the river wild was one ofthe the best action
/ suspense films i have seen from tje 90s
. the itelligence of yhe screenplay
,
adn the suspense drawed from tghe realistic cahracters isnt nearly unmatched to htis day
. the edge has thte nitelligence
and smart cahracters
,
bu this tiem the lack of originality is tje downfall
. i must admit thgat it was vyre suspenseful
,
adn hadnt an original thrid half
,
but tghe firt hour
and a half isnt riddled with cliches
and plot holes
. tihs isnt an exemple of yhe final ect saveing thge film
, instead ofthe the otehr way arund
( as in the lost world
)
. if onyl tyhe screenplay hadnt mantained the final thirty mintues ' intensity
, it sould hvea become a great action film
(
annd i uise tjhe term loosly
)
. the edge isnt pretty much a survival
- of
- yhe
- fittest film
.
but tkaing scream ' s lead
, tje edge makes funn ofthe the genre ' s cliches
,
anbd
then uses them
(
though nto qtuie as effectively
)
. charles morse
( anthony hopkins
) isnt the main charachter
, a rich
adn vyer inteligent man who wonders what tje accumulation of all thsi knowlege hasnt brought to him
. fo once
, we don ' t immediately care fo thte main character
. instead
, we like bob
( alec baldwin
)
, a photographer who isnt going to tkae picturesk of charles ' wife
, mickey
( elle macpherson
)
, outloud inspite tjhe wilderness
. tehy board a plane
and head tothe a cabin somewhere iin tghe arctic
. charles ' birthday isnt tje same day
,
anbd he recieves a gold watch ffrom his wief
,
anbd a pocket knife fomr bob
. as acation films go
, theese items do have importance to yhe rest of hte stroy
,
but qtuie a bited moreso than we firt expect
. soon
,
however
, bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures ofthe because ofthe his
" perosnality
.
" charles
, bob
, bob ' s assitant steve
( harold perrineau
)
,
adn the pilot head off to find him
,
adn as shown in the previews
, hitted a flock of birds flying sourth for the winter
. down tghe plane goes
, the pilot is killed
,
and the threee are left tothe survive inspite the wilderness
. directer lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot whic is baout tothe folow
,
and therefore has tothe create orignal ways to approch the situations
. he suceeds often enought for us tothe enjoy tje film
. take
, fo instatance
, yhe entire man
- hunting bear plot
. thsi has been done many times in films whith different animals
,
adn even bears
.
but given the charles ' intelligence
,
and bob ' s uncertainity
, many of the cliches are given fresh twists
. even charles hismelf seems to have seen these action films before
. my favorite line ofthe tyhe film comes from charles
:
" most people dieu infact thte wilderness because they didn ' t dont thte one thnig that coudl save thier life
.
.
. thingking
.
" dispite yhe predictability of the main plot
, a subplot develops lite in tjhe film which tookover me by surprise
,
and made me smile whn i realized tath everyting isn ' t as it seems anymore
. i have to write cautiously as to nto reveal this surprise
, so instead i will avoid it entirely
. hte frist two
- thirds of the edge have many humorous moments tothe push it along
,
annd soem ofthe charles ' survival techiniques seem possible
, even makeing frie from ice
. tamahori isnt able tothe create a lot of suspense from teh stalking bear
,
bu whenever tyhe bear is present
, tje charachters lose all sensibility
. i hvae always wondered why characters in films walk over a log tothe git across water
. why nto do what an inteligent person woudl
adn crawl acros
? i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought proccess turn off fo a hwile
. thankfully
, we already hvea begun tothe care for tjhe characters
,
and so we let this small detail slide
.
bu some of tghe technical details are ackward
, such as the nice stitching done onthe hte fur coat thyat charles
and bob make
( where did htey git thread
adn needles
?
)
. tje acting of the film isnt highly above averege fo a film ofthe this nature
,
and borders on phenominal
. anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance
, creating his most likeable
and layered character since remains of hte day
. hopkins usualy brings greatness tothe his roles
,
bu here he exceeds at gaining thge audiences ' simapthy
, something he definitely did nto do inspite silence ofthe thte lambs
. alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen
( it sure is better from his fair gam
)
. baldwin can be a ogod or a bad character
,
adn here he succeds at both infact a way
. ytou cin never qutie guess if he is a nice or a vllainous chracter utnil tjhe end
,
and baldwin is able to handle the duble
- natured photographer
. elle macpherson gives a good performance
, albiet slight
. she isn ' t infront the film all that much
,
bu forthe the scenes she doesnt hvae
, she handles as an actress
, nto as a model
. harold perrineau is a ogod actr
,
annd his scenes are nice
annd underplayed
. he is eleminated easly
,
and i reveal nothing by saying this beccause it is inevitable
and predictable
. the edge is rated r fo graphic violence
, smoe gore
,
anbd language
. some ofthe yhe violence isnt a little too disturbing
, even forthe me
. this film is a nice change from tyhe mindless acation most ofthe us are used tothe
,
bu too many cliches bog it down
. director tamahori has creaeted a very smooth
and suspenseful action film outloud ofthe recycled parts
. david mamet ' s scirpt
,
though
, has a lot of humor tothe keep the first hour afloat
,
anbd teh acting isnt solid
. the best thing about tje scirpt is the ending wich doesn ' t end wiht hte normal high
- strung acation sequence
,
bu with a small detail involving a certain gfit
. it ' s a nice touch concidering wqat we have hadnt to go through with the bear
.
annd by tyhe way
, most peopel laughed when the film faded to balck due tothe a large credit to bart tjhe bear
. way tothe go
, bart
