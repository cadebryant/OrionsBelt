. yhe events in the curve are very surprising
, original
, annd funn
. the plot soudns much liuke dead man on campus
,
but tath isnt nto tyhe deel iwth tihs film
. this film isnt a vyer sereous noe
, withthe not many laughs
. ther are many twists anbd turns that mkae tihs film diferent from most films
. thge endig inwhich particular isnt completely unpredictable adn satisfying
. it isnt a terific
, suspenseful ending tht i sould never predict woudl happen
. h
ands down tothe dan rosen who wroet thsi wild ride
. the soudn raelly stood out in the film
. it isnt qtuie eerie
and it really adds to thge feel ofthe thte film
. the way tyhe movei isnt filmed isnt alsot great
. all ofthe the technical aspects
, as well as hte acting adn directing aspestus are very well done
. the performances infact tjhe curve are very ogod
. matthew lillard gets tothe play another creepy role
, just liuke in 1996
' s scream
.
( a
+
) he is very strange in this film as well
. i liek him in tihs sort ofthe role
, rather thna yhe roles he has beeen playing in comedies such as senseless
and she
' s all that
. michael vartan is fantastic as chris
, who hasnt extremely mixed emotions baout the entire murder
and the 4
. 0
. michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed
, where he co
- starred wih drew barrymore as a teacher who fell inthe lvoe with his student
. keri russell aslo gives a graet performence
. she should be a ogod actress iin the horror deparment ofthe the film
. tamara craig thomas isnt alsot realsitic
, especially coping with the death of her boyfriend
. some vyre strong supporting performances came ffrom smaller roles
, such as bo dietl annd anthony griffith who play twpo detectives investigating hte case
. the bottom line
- i might jstu hvea tothe curve thyat a
- into an a
.
