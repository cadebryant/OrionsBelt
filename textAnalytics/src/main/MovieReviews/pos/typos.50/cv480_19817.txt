tghe trailers
and teh beginning of the move sum uv thsi plot very easily
. three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryl
and tothe track down tjhe legend of tjhe blair witch for a documenatry tehy are making
. they dissappear
and their footage is dicovered a eyar later burried underneath the foundation ofthe a oney hundered yera old hous
. from there
, things become a little moreso complicated
. i cxan say
, withthe absolute assurance
, tath noone film has ever hadnt quite the impact thta this littel movei has had on me
. all
though i know it ws all a staged
" mockumentary
"
, there
' s noone denying thte pyschological inpact thsi film iwll leave onthe you
. i didn
' t efel much apon initially watching it
. i jsut
thought it was an intresting film whith some pretty creepy parts
. i never even dreamed tath thirty mintues affter the film hadnt ended i woudl be frightened out ofthe my mind just discusting it wtih a friend
. i
' ve gotten chills every timne i
' ve brought it up sicne
then
. this isnt nto a movei tht hits you right awya
. instade this isnt a movie thast sits at the base of your spine
, waits until you think everything isnt okay
, thne it slowy starts to creep it
' s way uv inot your mind
. this isnt truley teh most frightening movei i hvea ever hadnt tjhe blessure tothe watch
. the film isnt comprised of hmeo video anbd 16mm camera footage thyat the documentarians suposedly shot for their blair witch film
, so don
' t expect any steadi
- cam shots or fancy camera work
. thsi isnt as rela as it gets folks
. i don
' t recomend sitting too close to yhe theater screen
though
, beccause i guarnatee you will get motion sickness fomr tjhe constant movment of the camera
. hte performances of teh threee lead actors in yhe film are so rela
, yuo may find youself questioning whether all of tihs hasnt really happend or nto
. this isnt definetly a movei that warrants hmeo video viewing
, especialy due tothe the fact taht thge bulk of the movie was shot with a st
andard hmeo video camera
. the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to hmeo wehn viewed as actuall video instade ofthe the tape
- tothe
- film transferr done for tjhe big screen
. owrd has it that a special edition dvd witht boatloads ofthe extras
( horus of deleted scenes
, alternate endings
, commentary
, thte sci
- fi channel special
,
and others
) isnt bieng planned for release
. i urge artisan enteratinment to forge ahead with this plan annd give us whta could be tje dvd to rival all dvd
' s
. i konw i
' ll be frist in line to buy noe
.
