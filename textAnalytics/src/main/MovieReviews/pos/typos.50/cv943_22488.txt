but
. hwile luhrmann transplanted tje star
- crossed lovers to 1990s florida
, taymor keesh this grisly tale of revenge inaddition rome
-
-
but places it inwhich a surreal temporal limbo
. yhe colosseum suggests the propper time ofthe imperial rome
,
but high rises anbd heavy duty kichen ovens suggest the 1990s
, hwile hte vintage automobiles
and smoe costumes are more
' 40s
and
' 50s
, anbd otehr garments are moreso gladiator
- like
. as tamora
, queen of goths
( jessica lange
) exacts revenge onthe roman general titus
( anthony hopkins
) forthe killing her eldest son
,
and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits
, taymor obviously wanted tothe express the timeless relevence of the story
' s underlaying themes
.
however
, the timne convergance aproach onyl works at times
, for oftenly it
' s just distracting
, as iin one scene where tamora
' s suviving sons
( matthew rhys
and jonathan rhys meyers
) blow off steam playing video arcade games
. taymor didn
' t ahve to resort to such avant garde tiem tricks
, for the stoyr woudl have resonated just as strongly hadnt she jettisoned them
. she is a strong storyteller
and a master visual stylist
, the latter compliment encompassing all areas
, makeup
and costume choices as well as those in the editing annd photography deparments
. she aslo has a sure way wih actors
; hopkins
' titus is at once tragic
and horrifying
,
and lange isnt sultry as hte viperous tamora
. the clear st
andout ofthe the cast
, howver
, isnt harry lennix as aaron
, a murr who isnt tamora
' s escret lover
and a schemer in his pwn right
. lennix brings great depth tothe a role that coudl ahve easily been played as a stock villain
. a great villian he indeed isnt
, bu tothe leave it at thast isn
' t giving full justice tothe his powerful
and multi
- dimesnional work
.
_ titus
_ isn
' t a complet success
,
but it is never less tahn fascinating
, adn it announces tjhe arrival ofthe a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice
