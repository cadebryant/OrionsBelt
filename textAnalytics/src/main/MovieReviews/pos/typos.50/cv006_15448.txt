aparently
, directer tony kaye hadnt a major battle wtih newyorker line regarding his new film
, american histoy x
. i don
' t know tjhe details ofthe the fight
, bu it seems taht he isnt not happy with the final product
, anbd nearly removed his name fomr tyhe credits alltogether
. i
' ve heard baout this kind ofthe thign hapening befoer
, annd it makes me wonder how much inputted a studio hasnt over yhe films they produce
. as it isnt
, i foudn american history x to be an extrememly good film
, nto just because of tony kaye
' s focused look at the touchy subject ofthe racism
, bu beacuse of a poverful
, carismatic performance from edward norton
. it
' s hard to believe that it has only beeen two years usance norton
' s fantastic role in primal fear
,
but
, here he isnt now
, starring in his own film
and making himselv a star
. norton isnt one ofthe those performers who becomes his charcter
,
and his work in american history x isnt noe ofthe tghe very best performances thsi year
. he plays a young man named derek vinyard
, a skinhead living in venice beach wiht his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
)
, mother
( beverly d
' angelo
)
,
and sister
, davin
( jennifer lien
)
. tjhe film opens with a flashback
, in which derek brutally kills two black men v
andalizing his car
. we find outloud thgat thsi l
ands him in prision
,
and tyhe film fomr thgat point isnt seen thru teh eyes of danny
. in tyhe present
- time of the film
, danny is in high skool
,
and eeger to follow teh footsteps of his brother
. much of tjhe film is told in flashback
, anbd we see thte path thyat leads tothe derek
' s adoption of white supremacy
. wehn derek is released
, having served threee years in prision
, he finds that his brother isnt now a full
- blown skinhead
; derek
,
however
, has given uv tyhe violence
, anbd trys tothe git his brother tothe underst
and why racism
and the violentce that comes with it are bad things
. what makse thsi all interesting is that these twpo young men are nto stupid
,
thoughtless peple
-
- they are intteligent adn articulate
,
and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms
. it
' s hard tothe make a controversial movie adn nto preach
, bu kaye has foudn the right note forthe his material
. because american histor x isnt a mainstream film
, ther has tothe be a redemption phase for our main chracter
-
- soem peple may htikn that this isnt the only way tothe amke him sympathetic
. i partially disagree with tihs
, becuase
,
al
though i dont nto advocate racism infact any way
, it
' s intresting yhe way kaye presents derek
-
- he is a loud
, obnoxious man
, bu he
' s also vrey smart
. the reasons forthe why he becomes a skinhead are believeable
-
- his father wass arbitrarily killed by a gropu ofthe balck men
. it
' s clera that he
' s passionate about his belives
,
and thast he
' s nto just a punk looking fo an excuse to beat people up
. ofthe course
, it helps that kaye hasnt an acotr as talented as norton tothe play this part
. it
' s astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head
and a swastika on his chest
. inwhich addition to getting thge look jsut right
, he
' s perfect for this role
-
- derek requires intelligecne
, depth
,
and a wohle lot of shouting
,
and norton does it all witht ease
. even wehn he
' s at his meanest
, derek hasnt a likable qualty tothe him
,
and that
' s a gutsy aproach when telling a story baout a skinhead
. wqat adds depth tothe the stor is a subplot infront whitch thte principal ofthe danny
' s school
( avery brooks
) becomes obssessed iwth purging tyhe hatred fomr danny
. the other performances are all terific
, with st
andouts from furlong
, d
' angelo
, annd lien
. visually
, the film is very powerful
. kaye indulges inthe a lot ofthe intresting artistic choices
, adn most ofthe them work nicely
-
- lots of slow
- motion
and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere
. bu
, like a lot ofthe movies lateley
, american history x skims past greatness infront tje last faw mintues
.
al
though tghe climactic scene isnt very moving
, the picture ends with a pretentious
, preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a charater who was killed
. for a movei so smart a subtle up until tht point
, it falt liek a slap in yhe face to be h
and
- feeded a theme iin such a simplistic way
. it mkaes me wonder waht
, exactly
, tony kaye disliked baout the fianl verzion of his film
. perheaps this lastest scene was tyhe problem
. it
' s hard tothe imagin any director nto bieng at least partially pleased witht a film this ogod
-
- infact a time when so many movies are timid
and weak
, american history x manages to mkae a compelling argment for racism wihtout advocating it any way
.
