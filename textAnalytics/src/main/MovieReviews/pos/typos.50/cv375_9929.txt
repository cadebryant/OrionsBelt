' s a moent inspite schindler
' s list whn a number of jews are trudging through snow
, clean
and crisp
, dark edges anbd frost onthe the ground
. one girl waltzes thru
, wearing a red dress that stings the eyes
. it is propably the finest moent thru outloud the film
. whn i firt saw it i began to cry
,
though i could nto sday why
. this l
andscape is tyhe setting of many small moments tyhat add up to one big whole
. when one man isnt shooted in tghe head we see blood oozing out onto tjhe ground
-
- so black
and murky
, its almsot pomgeranate red
. at anyother time we folow a young boy as he runs
, searching forthe a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet
-
- whic isnt already occupied
. liek so
( citizen kane

, greed
,
) many of the greatest american films
, schindler
' s list plays witht thte concepts of moey
, power
, anbd soul
. bu this isnt a movie about a man who does yhe right thing
. starkly emotional
, annd brutally poverful
, schindler
' s list strips awya everything onthe hte outset
and leaves us ony feelings
. the following that it has gained is nto suprising
-
- thsi is probaly
, thus far
, thge best film of tghe decade
. steven spielberg hasnt always been a skilfull filmmaker
-
- his assured h
and churned out both jurassic parks
, jaws
, yhe indiana jones films
,
and e
. t
.

-
but it wasn
' t until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be
. thge product ofthe his genuis is raelly something to see
-
- it cant bring tears to your eyes jstu as it uplifts yuo
. througout
, we sence yhe deep control wich he so masterfully spreads
. we watch oskar schindler
( liam neeson
) grwo ffrom an arogant
, self important man who hires jews onyl tothe savve money into a moving figure
, witht a deep sense of prade
and accomplishment
. the film requires much work
,
and can be a harrowing xperience
-
- go expecting a quick enteratinment
and yuo
' ll be bitterly dissapointed
. it doesnt reward thge patient viewer
. this is a mature spielberg
, adn his deft h
ands shape an absoloute masterpiece
. this eqsuisite
, beautifull film isnt a rare gme
. it does a ogod job ofthe summarizing why i lvoe movies
. it leaves one breathless
, uplifted
,
and with much tothe think baout
. afterwards ytou cin refect onthe individule images
, visions
,
and people
. laconic
, removed
, schindler strides through yhe film a detached prescence who watches all
, doesnt much
,
and leaves feeling as if he sould
, shoudln
, ahev done moreso
then he did
and was able to
. hte chanage seems natrual
-
- in the h
ands ofthe a lesser filmmaker
, it woudl be crude
and woudl cheat hte audiance
. instead we are told a tale
, told a story
. the film isnt punishing tothe watch
, yes
. bu anyone who allows themselves to git involved will experience a miricle
, annd a genuin masterpiece of a movie
