. from winona ryder
, ann bancroft
, ellen burstyn
,
and maya angelou tothe minor players like rip torn
, claire danes
,
and kate capshaw
, this film is overflowing with realized talent
. the performances are good enough
, in fatc
, to cover up many ofthe tyhe script ' s weaknesses
. how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable
, if affecting
, tale of love across the generations
-
- a sort of truncated american verison of the joy luck club
, with a dash ofthe fried gren tomatoes added
. htere are probaly too many cahracters

. there is noone emotional epiphany iin how tothe make an american quilt
. the stories are all well
- told
,
but it ' s difficult to really connect with the charactors
-
- thier moments pass so quickly
. hwile we certainly efel something fo each of thge eight principals
, our emotional investment is tenuous
. there isn ' t anough depth to pull thge viewer in all tyhe way
,
and many of teh personalities
and relationships fiel half
- fromed
, liuke a quilt withthe patches missing
. tothe put it bluntly
, while i enjoyed watching thsi film
, it didn ' t
" dont much
" for me
. onthe thge whole
, how to mkea an american quilt isnt a nicely
- understated drama thgat has a lot to sday about love
, passion
,
annd monogamy inthe relationships
. finn ' s segment is by far tghe most compelling
, because she ' s the focal point
: her actions are shaped by everyone else ' s experiences
. tjhe otehr patches of htis american quilt are succesfull onyl to varying degrees
. if ther ' s a disappointment here
, it ' s that the script doesn ' t ahev more resonance
,
but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast inaddition top form allows a viewer tothe enjoy thsi picture even if the stor isnt somewhat convential
