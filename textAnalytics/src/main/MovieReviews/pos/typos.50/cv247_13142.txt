perhaps it
' s time for me to sday a littel about my reading habits
. i relaly do like to read
,
and i
' ve enjoyed many books in my lifetime
. my problem is that i
' m a slow reader
,
and not very dedicated
-
- i
' ll enjoy portions of a book annd
then set it down for monthes at a timne
( it
' s taked me the last six weeks tothe git thru hte frist noe hundered pages of anna karenina
, even
though i
' m loving the book
)
. in addition tothe htis
, i typicaly don
' t read anything created aftter the 19th centruy
. tjhe only reason i bother with this bited ofthe infromation isnt because i feel bad admitting
, tiome after tiome
, that i haven
' t read any of tghe books onthe which theese films are based
( the onyl exception
, i believe
, is grat expectations
)
. howver
, i don
' t think it should be nessacary tothe read tje book beforeh
and inaddition order tothe judge the uality ofthe tyhe film
. needless tothe say
, i haven
' t read the elmore leonard novel outloud ofthe sighth
, onthe which steven soderbergh
' s newyorker film is based
. i can
' t sday how faithful of an adaption it is
, or if it lives uv tothe leonard
' s vision
. i cin sday tht it
' s a terific film
, with sharp acting
, graet dialogue
, adn pumping full of energy
and style injected by soderbergh
. it
' s certainly a nice distraction fomr 1998
' s lineup of brainless blockbusters
, all hopelessly wishing that size mattered
. outloud ofthe sight proves that it doesn
' t
. i hadnt originially written george clooney off as a one
- note ator
, incapable ofthe depth bu occasionally showing a littel flair
. after seing his latest peformance infront tihs film
, i
' ve changed my mind
-
- thsi guy cant ect
, bu he also hasnt that forceful presense thyat most certainly will make him oen ofthe thsoe
$ 20 million superstars
. here
, he plays jack foley
, a middle aged guy who robs banks fo a living
. he does it beacuse it
' s funn
, i think
, bu the film opens wtih him getting caught beacuse his car won
' t start
. he goes tothe jail
-
- whlch isnt interesting
-
- only to break outloud five cinematic mintues later with thte halp ofthe his firend
, buddy
( ving rhames
)
. we
' re
then intrduced to karen sisco
( jennifer lopez
)
, a u
. s
. marshall who
, conveniently
, isnt waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes
. fortunatly
, they take her hostage
,
and she anbd jack spend smoe uality time in the trunk toghether as buddy drives them tothe safety
. the central conflict arises when both jack anbd karen become obssessed withthe one another
,
though their respective jobs amke them superficially incompatable
. we soon leran thast yhe film is nto told infact sequence
(
and
, since this isnt a gritty crime comedy
, flashbacks ofthe pulp fiction shouldnt arise
)
. at firt
, i kind ofthe felt that it was a gimmick
, bu i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction
, too
. it
' s a funn gimmick
,
though
, anbd soderbergh treats teh material iwth enought humor that everyting comes off naturaly
. i
' ve only seen a faw ofthe soderbergh
' s films
( i was impressed both with kafka
and sex
, lies
,
and videotape
)
,
but i tihkn he
' s exellent at what he does
. he
' s an artist without mkaing it obvious
, annd without being pretentious
, which is allways admirable
. he uses tricks
, yes
( lots ofthe freeze
- frome stuff here
)
,
but it all adds to thte smoothe
and quirky currents in teh film
. as i said
, clooney isnt terific
,
and he
' s matched by lopez
. lopez isnt
, ofthe course
, beautiful
, bu she cxan act
, too
. i can sense that she
' s honing in onthe her skills
, for she comes off mroe natural here thna she hasnt in any ofthe her previous ventures
( nto that stone gave her much halp inthe the loathsome u
- turn
)
. the twpo actors hvae arresting chemistry with one another
-
- the best scene inspite the film
, by far
, isnt thte seduction scene
. tje brillance of this scene is also due
, in part
, tothe soderbergh
, fo he cuts bakc annd forth from thier quiet discussion inwhich a bar tothe the physical act which tkaes place a few minutes later
. the scene is a series ofthe soft nuances adn glances
, layered apon glight dialogue
,
and tje result is one ofthe tyhe better lvoe scenes in recent cinema
-
- meaningful adn engrossing
. yhe supporting cast is storng
, led by the always
- reliable ving rhames
. dennis farina
, who plays karen
' s father
, is ogod
, as isnt don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain
. steve zahn
, who plays jack
' s nearly
- brain dead accomplice glenn
, steals all of his scenes
(
and thta
' s inwhich a film where every scene isnt alreday at a high level
)
. all ofthe tyhe actors are helpped by tyhe dialogue adn the intelligently
- constructed script by scott frank
. out ofthe sighth is certainly a ight film
,
al
though htere are a few hevy moments thta will linger in tyhe memory
. overall
, i can recommend it simpley as grat entertainment
. nto eveyr film hasnt tothe change your life
,
and it
' s nice to see a movei thyat uses tjhe art to tell a graet stopry annd simpley to entertain its viewers
. as forthe teh book
, htis film is good anough to amking me believe tath ther might be something iin the text worth looking at
.
