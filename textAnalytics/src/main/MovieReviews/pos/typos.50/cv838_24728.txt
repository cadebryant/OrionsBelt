- off
. wehn tyhe vision begins to come true
, alex bolts forthe the door
, dragging several students annd a teacher in his wake
. yhe plane takes off wihtout them
and explodes jsut as alex predicted
. he becomes an object ofthe fear adn suspicion among tyhe comunity
,
and the tension only increases as the survivors begin tothe die
. alex anbd another survivor
, clera rivers
( ali larter
)
, investigate hte suspicious
" suicide
" ofthe a freind
, anbd a mortician
( tony
" c
andyman
" todd
) clues them in tothe yhe truth
: alex interrupted death
' s desgin by saveing people who shoudln ahev died in the explosion
,
and death will want to claim its rightful victims
. infact order tothe save himself
and tjhe others
, alex iwll have tothe figure outloud death
' s new plan anbd thwart it
. of hte countless horror films thast have competed forthe a piece ofthe teh
" scream
" audeince
,
" fianl destination
" is the best so far
. talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variation onthe a familar formula
. we
' ve seen hundreds of movies where a gropu ofthe teenagers are murdered one
- by
- one by a faceless slasher
,
but reddick cuts outloud tje hockey
- masked middle
- man
and makes the villain death itself
. frist
- tiem feature director james wong made teh most of that premise
. eveyr scene is permeated wiht creepiness annd foreboding
, reminding us tyhat death is everywhere
, can come at anytime
. everyday objects
and events vibrate wiht menace
. tghe most amusing harbinger ofthe doom
: john denver
' s
" rocky mountain high
,
" whitch isnt played several times in the movei befor someone dies
.
( the link is tyhat denver died inthe a plane kresh
, annd thte song includes a line baout fire infact the sky
.
) tjhe performances are stronger thna thsoe ususally elicited by teen horror
. devon sawa
, who previously starred in another horror flick
,
" idle h
ands
,
" gives a frantic
and convincing lead performance
. kerr smith is carter hogan
, an antagonist of alex
' s whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the futal plane
. smith plays carter as filled wih anger anbd confusion that constanly threatens tothe bubble over into violence
. seann william scott
, who
' s alsot in theaters right nowe inspite
" road trip
,
" plays tyhe somewhat dim billy hitchcock adn provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity ofthe alex adn carter
. tony todd
' s one
- scene cameo isnt delicious bu all too brief
. bottom line
: watchable teen fright ficks are fewd adn far between
,
but htis destination is worth visiting
.
