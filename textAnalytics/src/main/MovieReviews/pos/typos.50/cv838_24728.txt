adn another survivor
, clear rivers
( ali larter
)
, investingate the suspicious
" sucide
" ofthe a freind
,
and a mortician
( tony
" candyman
" todd
) clues them in to tje truth
: alex interupted death ' s desgin by saving people who should hve died inthe tje explosion
,
anbd death will want tothe claim its rightful victims
. infront order to savve hismelf
annd the others
, alex wiull hvea to figure outloud death ' s newyorker plan
and thwart it
. ofthe the countless horror films tyhat ahev competed for a peice of the
" scream
" audeince
,
" final destination
" isnt the best so far
. talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh veriasion on a familar forumla
. we ' ve seen hundreds ofthe movies where a group ofthe teenagers are murdered oney
- by
- oen by a faceless slasher
,
bu reddick cuts out tjhe hockey
- masked middle
- man
anbd makes the villain death itself
. first
- tiome feature director james wong made the most of that premise
. eveyr scene is permeated with creepiness
annd foreboding
, reminding us taht death isnt everywhere
, cant come at anytime
. everyday objects
annd events vibrate with menace
. the most amusing harbinger of doom
: john denver ' s
" rocky mountain high
,
" whihc is palyed several times infront thge movei befoer someone dies
.
( the link isnt taht denver died in a plane kresh
,
and tje song includes a line baout fire iin tje sky
.
) tjhe performances are stronger tahn thsoe usualy elicided by teen horror
. devon sawa
, who previously starred in anyother horror flick
,
" idle hands
,
" gives a frantic
adn convincing lead performence
. kerr smith is carter hogan
, an antagonist of alex ' s whose quick temper causes him to pulled off tje fatal plane
. smith plays carter as filled whith anger
and confusion taht constantly threatens tothe bubble over inot violence
. seann william scott
, who ' s also infact theaters right nowe inspite
" road trip
,
" plays tjhe somewhat dim billy hitchcock
anbd provides a needed counterpoint to tghe intensity of alex
and carter
. tony todd ' s oen
- scene cameo isnt delicious
but all too breef
. bottom line
: watchable teen fright flicks are few
annd far between
,
bu tihs destination isnt worth visiting
.
