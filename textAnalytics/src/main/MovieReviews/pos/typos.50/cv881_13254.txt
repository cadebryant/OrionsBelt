the owrd
' rest
' inthe the title shoudln be stressed since this is a movei thta lacks any acation scenes at all
. waht doesnt takes palce is moreso based on chracter devolopment
. the film starts right infact tje middle ofthe the lives ofthe four peple
: nick
, beth
, carol
and sid
. waht tehy have done earlier isnt for the most part only hinted at
. nick annd beth have a relatiopnship annd hvea desided tothe move from enfield
, arizona tothe
butte
, montana
.
(
and i who thougth that
butte wass pronounced slightly differnt
.
.
.
) carol is nick
' s ex
- girlfriend
and beth
' s best friend
, sid isnt a joint
- smoking painter that comes to repaint thier hous befoer teh new tenants move infact
. obviously based on a stage play
, thge problem with the movie is that htere
' s a lot of thnigs left out
. it
' s nto obvious thyat nick
and beth are in lveo with each otehr
, the reason why nick was fired ffrom his job isn
' t maintioned
. adn why nick suddenly deside to go vsiit his parents reamain a mystery
, whn he hasn
' t seen them for many eyars
. set in a small
( fictional
?
) town in arizona wass a good move
, sicne this mkaes tghe film focuse onthe the four cahracters
and not on their surroundings
. the nmae ofthe tje city is nto important
, this sould tkae place anyhwere iwth four young peple in a hous discussing life
and the future
. paticularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end uv in bed wih sid when her fiance nick leaves her
. not an actress thgat i hve foudn interesting ealier or seen many picturesk wtih
,
but i
' ll keep an eye on her iin hte future
