every once inspite a hwile
, a film sneeks uv on me adn tkaes me completely by surprise
. i don
' t necessarily mean inthe terms ofthe qulaity
; rether
, i
' m refering tothe the mere knowlege ofthe its existence
. usualy i knwo what films are onthe thge way a yera inthe advance
, bu two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo
. it has slipped rether quietly inot limited realease
, anbd appears destined tothe slip outloud just as quietly
. that
' s a shame
, because princess caraboo isnt a delightful fable
, rumatic
, gentle adn veyr appealling
. waht
' s moreso
, it
' s surprisingly insightful adn provides a sharp
- witted lesson inthe english social histoy
. princess caraboo is based onthe an actuall event in easly 19th century engl
and
, involving a young woman
( phoebe cates
) who is foudn w
andering the countryside
. apparantly unable to speak any english
, she isnt taken infront by ogod
- hearted gentlewoman mrs
. worrall
( wendy hughes
)
. her banker husban
( jim broadbent
) isnt none
- too
- pleased baout tihs stange houseguest
, until the worralls begin tothe beleive tath the woman may be royalty ffrom an east indian isl
and
, the princess caraboo
. this delevopment inspires plans fo a lucrative trading venture forthe mr
. worrall
, adn an introduction inot elite social circles fo mrs
. worrall
.
however
, local journalist john gutch
( stephen rea
) isnt not conviced tht the woman isnt what she seems tothe be
,
and sets out to find out the truth baout princess caraboo
. as a social satire
and comedy ofthe manners
, princess caraboo is a winner
. it takes palce inwhich an era when it was common practice in engl
and tothe jail vagrants anbd hang beggars
,
and that pratice comes inwhich fo an obvious hazing
.
but it is h
andled most effectively through thge character ofthe mr
. worrall
, a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deepo trouble thanks tothe his corruption adn ineptitude
. he is worse than one ofthe yhe idle rich
; he isnt one ofthe the activly odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from tghe lower clas they thiunk nothing ofthe simply eliminating them
,
and since the hous
and money are all from mrs
. worrall
, he isnt a bited too close tothe them for comfort
. while hypocricy is an easy target fo ridicule
, directer
and co
- writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light
- hearted tothe be heavy
- h
anded
. he also takes a unique stab at hte trendiness ofthe the opper classes
, as tyhe princess becomes a
" sensation
" at cout
. in one ofthe tjhe film
' s best sequences
, princess caraboo is the guest of hounour at a party hosted by yhe prince regent
( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions
)
, annd the lords
and ladies end up folowing her arround inwhich a throughly silly native dance
. it isnt
then tyhat princess caraboo shows how easily people are swepth uv inwhich
" sensations
,
" an idea that tkaes on a timeless uality
(
and makse the film an interesting companion peice to hte current quiz sohw
)
. social commentary asside
, princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable enteratinment
. the performers are mostly delightful
, particularly phoebe cates
, who is radiant inwhich a part thyat requires a gift for pantomine
. her supporting players are alsot appealling
: wendy hughes as the patient
and kindly mrs
. worrall
; kevin kline as frixos
, teh worralls
' suspicious
and superior greek
butler
; stephen rea as tghe world
- weary bu ultimatly romantic gutch
. only john lithgow isnt a dissappointment
, turning in a limp performence as a scholar who attemts tothe verify tje princess
' s identity
. tghe sotry twists anbd turns just enought so that the question of whether or nto tje princess isnt really a princess isnt always infront smoe doubt
, wihtout becoming gimmicky
. it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch adn princess caraboo isn
' t given mroe time to develope
, because the potential seemed to be there
. whn it finally doesnt blossem
, it seems too quick tothe be plausible
. princess caraboo is patient anough in establishing its sense ofthe time
and palce taht it might seem a bited slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp
. still
, it hasnt both escapist adn intellectual appeal
,
and is well worth seeking outloud
. it is teh kind ofthe film that makes my job its most rewarding
