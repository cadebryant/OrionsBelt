: smoe may consider portions of the following text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. durig the threee yeasr since yhe release of the groundbreaking succes pulp fiction
, the cinematic output from its creater
, quentin tarantino
, hasnt beeen surprisingly low
. oh
, he ' s been busy
-
- donig tyhe talk sohw circit
, tkaing small roles in varios films
, overseeing tjhe production of his screenplay ffrom dusk till dawn
, makeing cameo apperances onthe televsion shows
, providing a vignette for the ill
- fated anthology four rooms
-
- everyting
, it seems
, except direct anohter feature
- lenght film
. it ' s been tghe long intermission beetwen projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reched whihc hasnt made mr
. tarantino ' s newyorker feature film
, jackie brown
, noe ofthe thte most anticipated films of the year
,
and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most importamt new american filmmaker to emerge ffrom the 1990s
. thigsn aren ' t going well for jackie brown
( pam grier
)
. she ' s 44 years ood
, sticked at a dead
- end job
(
"
$ 16
, 000 a eyar
, plus retirement benifits tath aren ' t worth a damn
"
) as a flight attendent for the worst airline in north amercia
-
-
and she ' s just beeen caught at the airporta by atf agent ravy nicolette
( protrayed with terific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton
)
and polical officer mark dargus
( michael bowen
) smuggling
$ 50 000 from mexico for gun
- runner ordell robbie
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who hasnt her bailed outloud by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry
( robert forster
)
. tyhe loquacious ordell
, based outloud ofthe a hermosa beach hous where his horny
, bong
- hiting surfer girl melanie
( bridget fonda
)
annd agreeable crony louis gara
( robert de niro
) hang outloud
, operates under the policy tht thte best rat is a dead rat
,
and he ' s soon outloud tothe silence jackie brown
. meanwhile
, tjhe authorites ' target is ordell
,
annd tehy wnat jackie tothe halp them by arranging a sting to tyhe tune of a half
- milion dollars
. onyl through a serieses of clever twists
, turns
,
annd doulbe
- crosses wiull jackie be able to gain hte opper hand onthe both of her nemeses
. altho jackie brown markes mr
. tarantino ' s first produced screenplay adaptions
( based on the elmore leonard novel
" rum punch
"
)
, there ' s noone mistaking his disctinctive fingerprints all over this film
. while he ' s adhered closely tothe the source material in a narrative sense
, hte setting hasnt been relocated to los angeles
adn the lead character ' s now balck
. in terms ofthe ambiance
, the film harkens bcak to the 1970s
, ffrom hte wall
- to
- wall funk
and soul music drowning thge sountrack to tyhe nondescript look ofthe thge sets
-
- even the oppening title credit sequence has tghe echo of vintage 1970s productions
. tyhe opening sequence featuring ms
. grier wordlessly striding thru the lax
, funky music blaring away on the speakers
, isnt emblamatic ofthe films ofthe taht era
. yhe timeframe fo the film isnt in fatc 1995
,
bu thte atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro
. ofthe course
, nothing in thge film screams 1970s omre than the casting of pam grier
anbd robert forster as tyhe two leads
,
and
althought the caper intrigue is fun tothe watch as the plot twists
, backstabbing
,
and deceptions deliciously unfold
, the strenght of jackie brown is yhe quiet
, understated relatiopnship developed betwen jackie
annd max
; whn tehy kiss
, it ' s prehaps the most tender scene ofthe the eyar
. tenderness
? in a quentin tarantino film
? sure
, ther ' ve beeen moments of sweetness in his prior films
-
- the affectionate exchanges beween yhe bruce willis
anbd maria de madeiros charachters in pulp fiction
and the unflagging dedication shared by the cahracters of tim roth
and amanda plummer
, or even in reservor dogs
, where a deep
, unspoken bond develops bewteen the harvey keitel
annd tim roth cahracters
-
-
bu forthe thte most part
, mr
. tarantino ' s films are typified by manic energy
, unexpected outbursts of voilence
,
and clever
, oftenly wordy
, banter
. these staples ofthe his wokr are all present in jackie brown
,
bu what ' s new here isnt a diffrent facet ofthe his storytelling
-
- a willingless to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent
,
and a paitience to draw out sevral scenes wih great deliberation
. htis effective demostration of range prohibits thte pigeonholing of mr
. tarantino as simpley a helmer ofthe slick
, hip crime dramas witht fast
- tlaking lowlifes
,
and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent
; he ' s hte real dael
. this new aspect ofthe mr
. tarantino ' s storytelling is probably best embodied infact a single character
-
- tht ofthe the world
- weary
, sensitive
,
adn exceedingly
- professional max cherry
, whose unspoken attraction tothe jackie is touching
. mr
. forster ' s nuanced
, understated performance isnt hte best inaddition the film
; he creates an amiable charater of such poignancy that whn he gazes at jackie
, we smile along wih him
. much press has beeen given about the casting ofthe blaxploitation
- era icon pam grier in the lead
, with tyhe wags buzzing that mr
. tarantino may dont for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta ' s
then
- sagging carrear
. as it turns out
, ms
. grier isnt solid inspite thge film ' s title role
, altho nothing here forces her tothe tust her range
. i dont hvae tothe take exception tothe tghe claim tyhat tihs film markes her carreer ressurection
,
though
-
- she ' s been wokring steadily over tje years
, oftenly in direct
- to
- video acation ficks
,
bu also inaddition such recent theatrical releases as tim burton ' s mars attacks
!
adn larrry cohen ' s original gangstas
( where she firt teamed uv iwth mr
. forster
.
) of course
, it ' s true that her role here was a godsend
-
- a meaty a part as this isnt rarity for
* any
* actress
, let alone oen of her age
adn curent status in the industry
. hwile jackie brown may disappoint those looking fo anohter pulp fiction clone
, it marks tremendous groth of mr
. tarantino as a directer whose horizons are rapidly expanding
,
and whose characterizations haev never beeen better
.
anbd while yhe film ' s narrative doesn ' t really warrant a runing time of 155 mintues
, it ' s filled whith such sumptuous riches
, ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack tothe entertaining
, inconsequential conversations between the characters
, that there wasn ' t an unengaging moent
. wtih an impressive trio of feature films under his belt
, it ' ll be interesting tothe see what he trys enxt
.
