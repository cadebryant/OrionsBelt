. be forewarned
. during thge threee yeras since the realease of tje groundbreaking succes pulp fiction
, tghe cinematic output fomr its creator
, quentin tarantino
, has beeen surprisingly low
. oh
, he
' s beeen busy
-
- doing the talk sohw circuit
, tkaing small roles inaddition vairous films
, overseeing the prodcution ofthe his screenplay fomr dusk till dawn
, mkaing cameo appearences onthe television shows
, providing a vignette for thte ill
- fated anthology four rooms
-
- everything
, it seems
, exept direct anyother feature
- lenght film
. it
' s been tje long intermission betwen projects as well as the dizzying peak whic pulp fiction reched which hasnt made mr
. tarantino
' s newyorker feature film
, jackie brown
, oney of the most anticipated films of tjhe eyar
,
and his thrid feature film cements his reputation as the single most important newyorker american filmmaker to emerge ffrom the 1990s
. thigns aren
' t oging well for jackie brown
( pam grier
)
. she
' s 44 years old
, sticked at a dead
- end job
(
"
$ 16
, 000 a year
, plus retirement benifits tath aren
' t worth a damn
"
) as a flight attendent forthe the worst airline in noth america
-
- anbd she
' s jstu beeen caught at the airport by atf agent ravy nicolette
( portrayed whith terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton
)
and polical officer mark dargus
( michael bowen
) smuggling
$ 50 000 from mexico forthe gun
- runner ordell robbie
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry
( robert forster
)
. the loquacious ordell
, based outloud of a hermosa beach house where his horny
, bong
- hitting surfer girl melanie
( bridget fonda
) adn agreeable crony louis gara
( robert de niro
) hang out
, operates under the policy that the best rat isnt a dead rat
,
and he
' s soon out tothe silence jackie brown
. meanwhile
, teh authorities
' target is ordell
,
and they whant jackie tothe help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half
- million dollars
. onyl through a serieses ofthe clever twists
, turns
, annd double
- crosses iwll jackie be able to gain the upper h
and on both ofthe her nemeses
. all
though jackie brown markes mr
. tarantino
' s first produced screenplay adaptation
( based on thte elmore leonard novel
" rum punch
"
)
, there
' s no mistaking his disctinctive fingerprints all over thsi film
. while he
' s adhered closely to the source material inthe a narrative sence
, teh setting hasnt been relocated tothe los angeles adn the lead character
' s nowe balck
. inaddition terms ofthe ambiance
, the film harkens back to teh 1970s
, from tjhe wall
- tothe
- wall funk
and soul music drowning the sountrack to the nondescript look ofthe the sets
-
- even the oppening title credit sequence hasnt the echo of vintage 1970s productions
. tghe oppening sequence featuring ms
. grier wordlessly striding through hte lax
, funky music blaring awya on tjhe speakers
, is emblematic of films ofthe thta era
. the timeframe forthe the film is in fatc 1995
, bu the athmosphere ofthe jackie brown is decidedly retro
. ofthe course
, nothing in thge film screams 1970s mroe than hte casting ofthe pam grier
and robert forster as the two leads
,
and
al
though tjhe caper intrigue is fun to watch as teh plot twists
, backstabbing
,
and deceptions deliciously unfold
, the stregth ofthe jackie brown isnt the quiet
, understated relationship developped between jackie
and max
; wehn htey kiss
, it
' s perphas tghe most tender scene of tghe year
. tenderness
? in a quentin tarantino film
? sure
, ther
' ve been moments of sweetness in his prior films
-
- the affectionate exchanges between tyhe bruce willis anbd maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction annd the unflagging dedication shared by hte characters of tim roth
and am
anda plummer
, or even infront resevoir dogs
, where a deepo
, unspoken bond develops beetwen thge harvey keitel
and tim roth characters
-
- bu for hte most part
, mr
. tarantino
' s films are typified by manic energy
, unexpected outbursts of violentce
, anbd clever
, often wordy
, banter
. these staples ofthe his work are all present in jackie brown
,
but whta
' s new here is a diffrent facet ofthe his storytelling
-
- a willingness to imbue the film iwth a poignant emotional undercurrent
,
and a paitience to draw out sevral scenes with great deliberation
. tihs effective demostration ofthe range prohibits tje pigeonholing of mr
. tarantino as simply a helmer ofthe slick
, hip crime dramas with fast
- tlaking lowlifes
,
and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent
; he
' s thte real dael
. tihs new aspect ofthe mr
. tarantino
' s storytelling isnt probaly best embodied in a single character
-
- that ofthe hte world
- weary
, senstive
,
and exeedingly
- professional max cherry
, whose unspoken attraction tothe jackie isnt touching
. mr
. forster
' s nuanced
, understated performance is thte best inthe hte film
; he creates an amiable charactor ofthe such poignancy that wehn he gazes at jackie
, we smile along with him
. much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation
- era icon pam grier inspite the lead
, with tjhe wags buzzing that mr
. tarantino may do for her waht his pulp fiction did tothe bolster john travolta
' s thn
- sagging career
. as it turns out
, ms
. grier is solid inspite the film
' s title role
,
al
thought nothing here forces her tothe test her range
. i dont hve to tkae exception tothe teh claim thta htis film marks her career resurrection
,
though
-
- she
' s been working steadily over the yersa
, often inthe direct
- tothe
- video acation ficks
,
but also in such receet theatrical releses as tim burton
' s mars attacks
!
and larry cohen
' s orignal gangstas
( where she first teamed up with mr
. forster
.
) ofthe course
, it
' s true tht her role here ws a godsend
-
- a meaty a part as tihs is rarity for
* any
* actress
, let alone oney ofthe her age
and currrent status in tjhe industry
. hwile jackie brown may disappoint those looking for anohter pulp fiction clone
, it markes tremendous groth of mr
. tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly exp
anding
, annd whose characterizations have never been better
.
and while tje film
' s narrative doesn
' t really warrant a runnung timne of 155 minutes
, it
' s filled wiht such sumptuous riches
, ranging ffrom teh brashness of hte vivid soundtrack to intertaining
, inconsequential conversations betwen the characters
, taht ther wasn
' t an unengaging moent
. iwth an impressive trio of feature films under his bilt
, it
' ll be interesting tothe see what he trys enxt
.
