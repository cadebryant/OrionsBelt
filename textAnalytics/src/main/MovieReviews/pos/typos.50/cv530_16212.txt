, oney ofthe thte major novelists fomr tjhe middle ofthe the twentieth centruy
, hasnt writen a number of fictional works baout the effects ofthe war onthe the individule
. a veteran of world war ii
,
and a witness tothe tghe pearl harbor bombings
, his novels are nto only grounded in realism
but poetic inspite nature
. htey are reminiscent ofthe stephen crane in their blunt eloquence
, a trait which lends itself tothe razor
- sharp focus
.
but prehaps none matches tghe scope ofthe his autobiographical novel
, thte thin red line
; nowe a cinematic masterpiece fomr director terrence malick
. the book
' s principal casted
, some thirty charactors
, has been trimmed down fo this rendition
,
but it still retains its most endearing value
. earch ofthe tghe roles has an everyman quality
, emphasizing jones
' examination of world war ii onthe tje american solider
. htere
' s a definitive chain of comm
and present
,
and tihs alsot plays on hte motivations ofthe tyhe cast
.
but most importantly
,
and perheaps intrinsic tothe tghe novel bu not tothe the movei
, a dynamic
and effective voice
- over isnt used
. malick hasnt several charachters realting their
thoughts
, giving the viewer a greater perspective ofthe the issues at stake
. tghe issues at stake are many
and one
. told from a limited thrid
- person perspective
( as opposed to a top
- down
, omniscient view
)
, the movei entails tghe struggle of an american infanty comapany

)
, who must actually execute the sucide orders h
anded down tothe them
. yhe thin red line is filled with intense
, visual peotry
,
but it
' s nearly three housr long
.
al
though teh intrest levle is high throughout the firt two hurs
, the climax comes fourty
- five minutes befoer the end of the movie
; it goes without saying that tyhe movei drags on yhe back end
. the thin red line iwll doubtless be compared tothe 1998
' s otehr masterpiece of war
, saving private ryan a countless number of times
. bu tothe do so isnt tothe belittle both films
, for
al
though similarities abound
, so do differences
. director malick hasnt a stopry tothe tell
, anbd fo those interested in listening
, this can be a very oust
anding movei
