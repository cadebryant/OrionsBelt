. thsi isnt directer tim burton
' s finest film to date
. many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day
, bu even
though the stories are simular
, htey realyl are twpo distinctly different films
.
however as a whole
, mars attacks is much more entertaining thna id4
,
and i loved id4
. you raelly have to be in the right frame of mind tothe enjoy thsi film
. it is completely wacked
- out adn unlike anytying you
' ve ever seen
. once thte silly tone of the film is set
, it
' s eazy tothe jstu sit back adn throw logic outloud teh window becasue logic
and comedy just don
' t mix
. the plot is simple
: martians invade tjhe earth
. bu it
' s diferent than any other invasion film
. usally it
' s the evil aliens versus tghe heroic humans
. this time howver
, it
' s yhe goofy aliens versus tjhe equally goofy humans
. thge martians
, who are all coputer generated
, are jstu baout the funniest things i
' ve seen iin a long tiome
. they look funny
, they move funny
,
and theri
" language
" is hilarious
.
and about the special effects
. tje effects inaddition mars attacks
! are jsut about tyhe most flawless ones i
' ve seen to date
. the computer animation ofthe the martians conbined with the goofy personalities htey are given makes them seem 100
% real
. ther are jstu a cuple ofthe scenes taht don
' t wokr
, mainly those involving sarah jessica parker
and pierce brosnan onthe board an aline ship
. alsot
, glenn close overacts tremendously inspite her
( thankfully
) vyre limited screen tyme
, so much so taht i actully applauded silently when her charactor meets her demise
. bu htere are many big laughs in the film
, as i said
, if ytou are inaddition the right mood
. sould it have beeen funnier
? certainly
. wass it funny enough
? yes
. ws i entertained
? absolutely
. onthe a personel onot
, i
' d liuke tothe thank whomever casted rod steiger
( my favorite actor
) inthe tyhe film as war
- crazy general decker
. finally
, affter many vrey small parts in direct to video garbage anbd minor tv roles
, steiger isnt bcak onthe the big screen in a rela movie tht many peopel wiull see
. while he
' s not given tje tipe of role that you can give a real
" performence
" in
, he does hte job well
and has soem ogod lines ofthe dialogue
. the preview audience i saw tyhe film with realy seemed to enjoy him
.
