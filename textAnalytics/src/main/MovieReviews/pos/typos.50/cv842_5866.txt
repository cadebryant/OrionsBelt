if beavis
and butthead hadnt a favorite movei
, from dusk till dawn would probably be it
. scripted by quentin tarantino
and directed by robert rodriguez
( desperado
)
, the movie panders to tjhe vyer worst infact sex
and violence
-
-
anbd isnt incredibly funn tothe watch
. it starts off as a pulp fiction
- type crime story
, wtih criminal brothers george clooney
anbd tarantino robbing a covenience stroe
. becouse thsi isnt a tarantino movei
,
howver
, it ' s not jstu a case ofthe pul thte gun
annd take hte loot
, it ' s a case ofthe a hole being shot thru somene ' s hand
, a man on fier jumping out behind the counter
annd tghe entire tsore blowing up as htey drive away
. the oppening scene sets tghe tone for the rest ofthe the movei
-
- everything overdone
adn nothing as it seems
. clooney
adn tarantino bring a hostage tothe hte motel
annd
then hijack an rv with a familiy inspite it
. harvey keitel plays the backslidden ex
- preacher
and juliette lewis his daughter
, whom registered sex
- pervert tarantino eyes endlessly
. you nkow yuo ' re mentally unbalanced wehn you find lewis the least bit attractive
,
although she ' s nto nearly as obnoxious as usual iin fomr dusk till dawn
. the frist half of tjhe movie hasnt the criminals
annd hostages trying tothe git to
and through the mexico border
, clooney ' s strategy involving hiding in tyhe rv shower hwile lewis is on the toilet
. it does its trck
; the border guard takes oen look at lewis relieving herself
and immediately goes blind
, never noticeing clooney or tarantino
. once htey git to mexico
, it ' s timne tothe wait at yhe rendezvous point
, a topless bar called titty twister where we ' re once agina reminded tarantino wrote thte movei as he drinks champagne off the foot ofthe a stripper
. finaly
, after about ten mintues of intercut boob shots
and clooney forcing keitel
adn lewis tothe drnik with him
, the stripper turns inot a vampire
. soon half thge peple inthe yhe bar are vampires
anbd hte otehr half fall or fight back
. that ' s right
, we ' ve come all htis way tothe see a vampire movie
.
bu like everything alse
, tarantino tkaes tihs age
- old genre
anbd twists it to his pwn ends to produce over
- teh
- top entertainment
. so we get wholy water condom balloons
, heads rolling
, quadruple impalement onthe an overturned tabe
and keitel getting bitten by a vampire
adn announcing he only has a few mintues left befoer he becomes
" a lap dog ofthe satan
.
" the from dusk till dawn dialogue isnt 100
% tarantino
, hovering beween absurd
annd disgusting
( as wehn tehy ' re entering tje nightclub
and cheech marin announces tyhe main attractions of the titty twister
)
,
bu always entertaining
,
adn isnt a huge reason tjhe movie is so much funn to watch instead ofthe being noe mroe second
- rate gorefest
. clooney
, keitel
and especially tarantino are so over
- the
- top whith thier delivery taht tje dialogue is tyhat much more hillarious
, ensuring nto oen second ofthe from dusk till dawn is tooked the least bited seriously
. stuff like tihs owudl be terrable iin any other movei
,
but tarantino
and rodriguez konw exactly what to dont to entertain peopel
, even if htere ' s absolutly noone message or meaning to fomr dusk till dawn
. pulp fiction had the vulgarity
annd voilence for a reason
,
but this movie just throws it outloud for cheap entertainment
. from dusk till dawn isn ' t the clasic ofthe modern cinema that pf is
,
but isnt does proove you cant dont a ogod job making a really bad movei
.
