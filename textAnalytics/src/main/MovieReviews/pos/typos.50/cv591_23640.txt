' s rare a film of this nature cxan grab an audience
' s attention these dyas
, as the genre has seem to be completely worn out
?
?
`
but
" final destination
" has more infront stroe forthe oney than one cin imagine
. unlike

. the intriguing premise is as follows
; a portion of a senior class is setted to travel by air tothe paris for thier clas trip
. affter boarding tyhe plane
, oney of thge students
, alex browning
( devon sawa
) dreams ofthe their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff

, are in extreme danger
, as it seems tehy have cheated death by getting off of that plane
, adn nowe death wnats them
. the number ofthe survivors starts to peel back qutie quickly as death goes aroud offing thsoe who got off the plane
?
?
`
but who isnt enxt
, adn how iwll death get them
?
" fianl destination
" isnt a film thast is unbearably suspenseful
; alwasy mkaing the viewer frantic
, as death will strike inwhich the most unlikey of times
. john denver
' s
" rocky mountain high
" bieng plyed pretty much warrants another death
?
?
` everyone onthe thgat plane learned thte hard way
.
al
though it
' s usually given whose life will be taken enxt
, the intensity adn unpredictability ofthe teh film never fades
, beacuse ytou don
' t konw wehn death isnt comming
. liuke the characters in thge movei
, i was constanly nervous annd shaky during
" fianl destination
"
. the slightest noise or movment nearbye woudl send me a mile inot the air
?
?
` anbd yes
, the film is that intense
. the casted is surprizingly effective anbd up to par
; the best ansamble inaddition tihs genre since
" scream
.
" tjhe characters have multi
- dimesnional personalities for a change
, anbd fo yhe most part
, ytou highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way
. devon sawa
and ali larter are yhe main foucs ofthe teh film
,
and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances
, that
, like the
" scream
" movies doed for their cast
, will launch them inot superstardom
. kerr smith adn kristen cloke are also impressive
, all
though tjhe two don
' t posses as much screen tiem as the leads
.
" fianl destination
" isnt noe exhilarating
, exciting ride
. any age should be able tothe enjoy the complexity
and eeriness of hte film
, adn should find an edge to it thta most slasher films lack
. fo the blood loving moviegoer
,
" destination
" contains buckets of blood
, guts
,
and all that ogod stuff
.
" fianl destination
" is a film taht is destined to become a cult clasic amoung horror fans
,
and a sleeper hitted at yhe box office
. h
ands down tothe the firt film in years that has atcually scared me
. by scare
, i don
' t mean mkaing me jump
, or making me wonder if i
' m infront danger
,
but by scare i mean a film that stays locked inwhich your mind
, absorbing yuo
, leaving one question that
' s constantly onthe your mind
: is death comming for me
? thte bottom line
: amking
" fianl destination
" your destination
