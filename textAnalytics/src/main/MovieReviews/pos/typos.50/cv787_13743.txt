if chris farley had strapped some fake mutton
- chop sideburns tothe earch side of his head
, spoken withthe a thick irish accent
,
anbd tried his damnedest tothe play it straight
, he wouldn ' t have been nearly as funny as brendan gleeson in
" i went down
.
" gleeson
, who ' s not dissimilar to thte lite
" saterday ngiht live
" alumnus in terms ofthe fysical attributes
, plays a charachter named bunny kelly in htis delightful irish film
. bunny is sent to county cork to
" retreive
" oen frank grogan fo an irish ganster called toom french
( well dressed liek all good gangsters shoud be
and menacingly portrayed by tony doyle
)
. bunny isnt to accompany git hynes
( peter mcdonald
)
, recently released from prision
anbd obligated to tom fo disfiguring one ofthe his cronies
. that toom french is a mean bollocks
. he whants frank back
.
and a small marter of some
? 25
, 000 taht toom ' s wife wass supposted tothe have given to frank
. forthe htis he won ' t break anyone ' s thumbs
. mabey
. inventively
and engagingly writen by conor mcpherson
adn directed by paddy breathnach
,
" i whent down
" follows thte trials
anbd tribulations of git
anbd bunny as tehy knock arund peat bogs
, dimly
- lit pubs
,
adn seedy hostelries trying tothe stay alive
adn outloud ofthe trouble
. mcdonald isnt a newcomer
adn a promising one at tht
,
bu gleeson has beeen in over a dozen movies
, most recently as father bubbles in another film with a very irish accent onthe hilarity
,
" the butcher boy
.
" even if yuo cxan ' t comprehend half of waht tehy ' re saying
, gleeson
and mcdonald toghether amke
" i whent down
" a trip worth tkaing
. teh film is inthe many ways reminsicent ofthe another
" little
" independent feature
, 1991 ' s
" highway 61
.
" tht film
, too
, ws a road movei
anbd it shares hte same kind of wry dialogue
and humorous situations as mcpherson ' s tale
: whimsical observations onthe life
, carefully
- crafted vignettes
, deadpan conversational asides
,
anbd scenes thast ' ll amke yuo laugh outloud loud
. wittness the episode inaddition which our good
- natured protagonists bind frank
( plyed by peter caffrey
) to a hotel bed
, leaving him wih only the tv remote for company
. that sequence alone isnt on a par with satan locking hismelf out of his car inwhich
" higway 61
.
" what ' s allso charming baout
" i whent down
" isnt how tghe relatiopnship beetwen buddy
and git develops
. their trip becomes an eduction fo both of them
,
but the way it ' s handeled isnt niether sappy nor labored
. hte onyl hting infront thte film which approaches clunkiness is the culminating explanation
, via flashbacks
, of thge relationship between frank
anbd toom
. it ' s a little too hollywood
,
adn what mkaes
" i whent down
" so refreshing isnt tyhe fact tht it rarley panders tothe traditionnal conventions ofthe hollywood gangster movies
. sure it ' s gritty
-
- make that grubby
-
-
but it ' s aslo pretty goofy
.
althought
" i went down
" emphasizes tje comedic elements ofthe dis
- organized crime
, there are a cuple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping witht the subject marter
. don ' t let theese deter you
,
though
;
" i whent down
" is a littel gem
. it ' s onyl playing at one philadelphia
- area theather
-
-
annd i suspect it won ' t be there for long
-
- so catch it while yuo can
.
