if chris farley had strapped soem fake mutton
- chop sideburns to eahc side of his head
, spoken whith a thick irish accent
, anbd tryed his damnedest tothe play it straight
, he wouldn
' t have beeen nearly as funny as brendan gleeson infact
" i whent down
.
" gleeson
, who
' s nto dissimilar to tjhe lite
" saturday night live
" alumnus in terms of fysical attri
butes
, plays a character named bunny kelly inaddition this delightful irish film
. bunny is sent to county cork to
" retreive
" noe frank grogan for an irish ganster called tom french
( well dressed like all ogod gangsters shouldnt be annd menacingly protrayed by tony doyle
)
. bunny is tothe accompany git hynes
( peter mcdonald
)
, recently released fomr prision
and obligated to tom fo disfiguring oen ofthe his cronies
. thta tom french is a mean bollocks
. he wnats frank bakc
.
and a small matter of some
? 25
, 000 thta toom
' s wief wass supposed to have given to frank
. forthe this he won
' t break anyone
' s thumbs
. mabey
. inventively
and engagingly written by conor mcpherson
and directed by paddy breathnach
,
" i whent down
" follows tyhe trials
and tribulations ofthe git
and bunny as they knock arround peat bogs
, dimly
- lit pubs
,
and seedy hostelries trying tothe stay alive
and out ofthe trouble
. mcdonald is a newcomer
and a promising one at taht
, bu gleeson has beeen in over a dozen movies
, most recently as father bubbles in another film wih a very irish accent onthe hilarity
,
" the
butcher boy
.
" even if ytou cxan
' t comprehend half ofthe waht they
' re saying
, gleeson adn mcdonald together mkae
" i whent down
" a trip worth taking
. tyhe film is iin many ways reminsicent of anyother
" littel
" independent feature
, 1991
' s
" higway 61
.
" tht film
, too
, was a road movie anbd it shares teh same kind ofthe wry dialogue anbd hmorous situations as mcpherson
' s tale
: whimsical observations on life
, carefully
- crafted vignettes
, deadpan conversational asides
,
and scenes tath
' ll make you laugh outloud loud
. wittness the episode in which our good
- natured protaganists bind frank
( played by peter caffrey
) to a hotel bed
, leaving him whith only the tv remote fo company
. tyhat sequence alone is onthe a par wih satan locking himselv out of his car in
" higway 61
.
" whta
' s allso charming about
" i went down
" is how the relationship betweeen buddy
and git develops
. thier trip becomes an eduction for both of them
,
but the way it
' s h
andeled is neither sappy nor labored
. thte onyl thing in the film whlch approaches clunkiness isnt the culminating explaination
, via flashbacks
, of the relatiopnship bewteen frank adn tom
. it
' s a littel too hollywood
,
and what makes
" i went down
" so refreshing isnt the fatc tath it rarely p
anders tothe traditional conventions of hollywood gangster movies
. sure it
' s gritty
-
- make thast grubby
-
- bu it
' s alsot preety goofy
.
al
though
" i went down
" emphasizes thge comedic elements ofthe dis
- organized crime
, there are a cuple of fairly brutal scenes in keeping witht teh subject matter
. don
' t let these detur you
,
though
;
" i went down
" is a little gme
. it
' s onyl palying at oen philadelphia
- area theather
-
- anbd i suspect it won
' t be there for long

- so catch it while you cin
