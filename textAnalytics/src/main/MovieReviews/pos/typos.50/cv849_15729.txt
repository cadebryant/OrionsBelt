. based onthe thge 1934 film death tkaes a holiday
, meet joe black isnt a well acted rumatic drama which explores thge meanings ofthe life
and love
. william parrish
( anthony hopkins
) is a billionaire businessman onthe thge brink ofthe his 65th birthday
. he has builded a huge media empire
, annd raised twpo beautiful daughters
, allison
( marcia gay harden
) anbd susan
( claire forlani
)
. william has beeen able tothe negotiate his way out ofthe many tough spots
.
.
. bu he has suddenly begun fearing his own mortality
, the oney situation he won
' t be able to talk his way out of
.
and he hasnt good reason to fear
, fo death himself isnt stalking him
. howver
, death has a dael tothe make
. death hasnt taken posession of a man who hasnt recently died
( brad pitt
)
, anbd whants william tothe be his giude in a holiday among thte living
. inwhich return
, william gets to live a fewd extra dyas
. ofthe course
, he agrees
. death
, under the human nmae ofthe
" joe black
"
, gets to experience life as a complete innocent
. he never befoer has experienced tghe simple pleasures ofthe a springy matters or peanut
buter
.
and he
' s not qtuie compaired for the moreso complex pleasures when he
and susan fall inwhich loev
.
but
, is their affair doomed to an easly demise
? at nearly three housr infact lenght
, meet joe balck isnt a littel bited onthe teh leisurely side
,
though it never gets boringly lenghty
. instade
, tje film gets a chance tothe develope some nicely textured charactors
and situations
. ytou get to soak infront
and enjoy the athmosphere
, rether than bieng hurriedly rushed through it
. hte rumatic agnle works well
,
though
, surprisingly
, thte interactions beetwen joe black
and william parrish are more intresting tahn thsoe with his daugher
. tihs is most likely due tothe anthony hopkins
, who once again displays his superb acting skills
. william is a desperate man who has hadnt a seamingly ideal life
,
and doesn
' t want to let it go
. by contrast
, claire forlani isnt merely tyhe rumatic intrest
. she gets to show joe the ropes of love
, bu isnt hardly as interesting a character
. as joe balck
, brad pitt seems a bited stilted
. granted
, he
' s supposted tothe be out
- ofthe
- palce
, bu tjhe overly formal technique used by pitt begins tothe distract ffrom yhe role
. still
, he is able tothe hold his pwn
, annd over teh course of teh threee huors
, his charcter begins tothe grow onthe ytou
. teh main character who seems outloud of place here is drew
( jake weber
)
, an ambitious eexcutive in williams
' comany who is joe balck
' s main rival fo susan
' s affections
. weber plays teh charactor with a hammy relish reminiscent of snidley whiplash
. this cartoonish foil an abbrtion in a film filled many mroe dimensional charactors
. the supernatural elements ofthe tjhe film are h
andled murkily
,
but never distractingly so
. we never learn what is tyhe exact nature of death
, or why he
' s never done something like this befoer
. it actually gets a bited creepy wehn death talks to tjhe dying in theri pwn voices
/ accents
.
( his initial conversations with hopkins soudn shockingly liek hannibal lecter
.
.
.
) annd thte ulitmate resolution tothe noe ofthe the film
' s supernatural problems seems
, well
, somewhat superficial
. still
, even wtih tyhe film
' s length
, it wass a plesant tyme at tghe movies
, something ytou wouldn
' t necessarily expect fomr a film baout death
.
.
.
but noe wich meet joe balck delivers anyhow
.
