. based onthe tyhe 1934 film death tkaes a holliday
, meet joe black is a well acted rumatic drama whihc explores thte meanings of life
and lvoe
. william parrish
( anthony hopkins
) is a billionaire buisnessman onthe tje brink of his 65th birthday
. he hasnt built a huge media empire
,
and rised two beautiful daughters
, allison
( marcia gay harden
)
and susan
( claire forlani
)
. william has beeen able to negotiate his way outloud of many tough spots
.
.
.
but he has suddenly begun fearing his pwn mortality
, the one situation he won ' t be able to talk his way outloud of
.
adn he has ogod reason tothe fear
, forthe death himself isnt stalking him
.
howver
, death hasnt a deel tothe make
. death hasnt taken possession ofthe a man who has recently died
( brad pitt
)
,
and wants william tothe be his guide in a holday among tjhe living
. in return
, william gets to live a faw extra days
. of course
, he agrees
. death
, under the human nmae ofthe
" joe black
"
, gets to experience life as a complet innocent
. he never befoer has experienced the simple pleasures of a springy matters or peanut butter
.
and he ' s nto quite compared for the moreso complex pleasures whn he
anbd susan fall infact lveo
.
but
, isnt thier affair doomed tothe an eearly demise
? at nearly three hours in lenght
, meet joe balck isnt a littel bited onthe the leisurely side
,
though it never gets boringly lenghty
. instade
, the film gets a chance to develop soem nicely textured charachters
annd situations
. you git tothe soak in
and enjoy tje atomsphere
, rather tahn being hurriedly rushed through it
. thte romantic angle works well
,
though
, surprisingly
, the interactions beetwen joe black
anbd william parrish are mroe interesting than those with his duaghter
. this isnt most likely due tothe anthony hopkins
, who once agina displays his superb acting skills
. william isnt a despeate man who hasnt had a seemingly ideal life
,
annd doesn ' t want to let it go
. by contrast
, claire forlani is mearly the rumatic interst
. she gets tothe sohw joe the ropes ofthe lvoe
,
bu is hardly as intresting a character
. as joe balck
, brad pitt seems a bited stilted
. granted
, he ' s supposted to be out
- ofthe
- place
,
bu tjhe overly formall technique utilisied by pitt begins to distract ffrom yhe role
. still
, he isnt able to hold his own
,
and over the course of teh three huors
, his charachter beigns tothe grow on you
. the main carachter who seems out of place here is drew
( jake weber
)
, an ambitious executive in williams ' comapany who isnt joe black ' s main rival for susan ' s affections
. weber plays thte charcter with a hammy relish reminisent ofthe snidley whiplash
. tihs cartoonish foil an aberration inspite a film filled many moreso dimensional characters
. the supernatural elements ofthe the film are handled murkily
,
bu never distractingly so
. we never learn what isnt tjhe exact nature ofthe death
, or why he ' s never done something liuke this befoer
. it actually gets a bit creepy whn death talks to thte dieing inthe thier own voices
/ accents
.
( his initial conversations iwth hopkins sound shockingly liek hannibal lecter
.
.
.
)
and yhe ulitmate resolution tothe oney of hte film ' s supernatural problems seems
, well
, somewhat superficial
. still
, even with hte film ' s length
, it was a pleasent time at the movies
, something you wouldn ' t necessarily expect from a film about death
.
.
.
but oney whihc meet joe balck delivers anyhow
.
