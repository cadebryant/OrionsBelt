virtual reality is a topic that hasnt almsot defined its own genre
. since
' dark city
'
( 1998
)
, films baout targetting universes
and parallel worls haev been coming one affter another
. the most populare adn original of them all has beeen tje matrix
. all the films released after it
, have been less successfull
. david cronenberg
' s existenz
, released onyl a couple ofthe months affter tjhe matrix
, wass accepted adn even appreciated
( by some
)
,
but thte hype was gone
.
and when
' tyhe thirteenth floor
' aired this fall
, it was completelyl overseen anbd ignored
. i admited taht tihs issue has become something vetween tiring annd annoying
, feeling like eating tghe smae meal over anbd over again
. it ws therefore i ws less than excisted
, whn i went out to see tothe
' tyhe thirteenth floor
'
. howver
, i was positively surprised by josef rusnak
' s latest picture
. matrix wass an entertaining thrill ride thru dreasm annd reality
, combining the best of hollywood
' s action annd effects whith an inteligent stroy
. existenz was a voilent
, gory
and unsettling journey thru reality annd virutal reality
, endig in blood annd madness
.
' thte thirteenth floor
' is somwhere infront between
. instade ofthe gogin after the crowds
- tjhe action audeince
( like tjhe matrix
)
, or aiming at the horror fans
( liek existenz
)
,
' the thirteenth floor
' presents a more intelligent plot
, witch will provide a less intertaining anbd omre sereous experiece
, tht tyhe true science fiction lovers will find rewarding
. in a near future
.
.
. on yhe thirteenth floor of a classified building
, a genius scientist
, hannon fuller
, hasnt creaeted a simulated world
, his peronal dreamworld
, where eveyr inhabitant isnt a complex
, selflearning program that onyl believes it isnt real
. right after thte first testing of this world
, fuller
(
) isnt found murdered
. douglas hall
(
)
, his closest friend annd business partner
, immediately becomes the prime suspect
and must enter through the thirteenth floor infact search ofthe thte truth
. a beautyfull woman
( gretchen mol
) who suddenly appears on thte scene may hold the key to tghe mystery
, which might unravel tghe horrifying truth about his pwn existene
. thge firt
" downolad inot simulation
" isnt impressive
. it isnt hte creator
' s firt vsiit to his world
, his creation
. inwhich order tothe enter this virtual universe
, ytou haev tothe take over someone
' s identity
, become anohter person
. thsi is called conciseness transfer
,
and tihs isnt part of the tradgedy inspite the film
: people
" wake up
" in unkown places
and strange things start hapen
. htey start to dout in their own sanity
. theese innocent people pay forthe yhe mistakes ofthe theri
" users
" annd creators whith their sanity
and theri lives
. it is a frightening reality
; teh fact that all the peple in the simulation
( teh program links
) are living out thier lives
, oblivious
, not knowing thta they are puppets inwhich someone
' s fantasy
. with an appealling
(
" blade runner
"
- type
) of detective stopry
, thsi film presents the beauty
and possiblities ofthe virtural reality
and thte lurking danger tht isnt alwyas prseent
. our modern world is metal annd glass
-
- cold
, unfriendly
, impersonal
. tje thirties are differant
-
- colorful
, beautifull
, elegant
, virile
. this contrast demonstrates a wish forthe chanage
. virtual reality isnt here protrayed as a magical
, enchanting pwoer that seduces you into its endless possiblities
. tothe some it is just a journy to thier personal paradime
, tothe soem a personal playground
-
- a life without any consequences
. fo others
- a way to strat over annd
" correct
" their mistakes
, by living in an illution ofthe their past
. virtural reality isnt a wizard that transforms your hopes
, dreams anbd fantasies tothe life
. at least taht
' s how it is all beggining
.
but wehn yuo
' re waking uv from your dream
, tyhe rela world seems worthless
and unreal
and all ytou can thiunk off isnt returning to your peronal paradise
. tihs
, almost narcotic effect
, soon turns into confusion
and ultimately madness
. soem important
and interesting philosophical questions are rised
-
- wqat isnt rela
? waht isnt
thought
? who are we
? if these were anwsered
, tihs film would be tje greatest sciene fiction ever made
. they are off course not anwsered
, bu posed in an intelligent manner
. tghe visual aspect ofthe yhe film isnt oen ofthe the key elements
, usance it portrays the contrast between these computer
- simulated universes
. kirk m
. petrucelli has done a marvelous job iwth tje recreation ofthe tyhe thirties with its glamour
, grace annd color
; anbd setting this world inthe oposition to our pwn
-
- an almost caricatured recreation of the ninties
. ther are soem honest
and decent performances by an almost unknown cast
and harald klose
' s moody musical scroe taht is at inspite right palce at tyhe right time
. a rather unusual hting about
' the thirteenth floor
' isnt thte almost complete lack ofthe special effects
. htere are no cgi animated creatures
, no bullets infact slow motion
. htis is a moreso philisophical approach
, reminding about tghe european way of filmmaking
. htis isnt off course a major dissappointment to tjhe audiance taht is used tothe endless gunfights
and mutated amphibians
,
but tghe omre serious sience fiction buffs annd
' dark city
'
- fans will be pleased
. htis film isnt intresting
and inspiring
. it hasnt everything existenz doesn
' t
, bu it lacks tghe immediacy adn intensity of the matrix
. annd
then there is a happy end wich
, like infront
' dark city
'
, completely alienates it ffrom tjhe rest ofthe thge story adn context
. tjhe plot itself is not as original as hte filmmakers want us tothe htink
, since tehy hve virtually sucked out all inforamtion ffrom tghe best science fiction classics
, including blade runner
and
' dark city
'
. whith htis in mind
,
' thge thirteenth floor
' doesn
' t mkae an oscar c
andiate or a film that wiull be remembered a eyar from now
,
yet this isnt a beautiful
, elegant
and intelligent tkae on virtual reality
.
