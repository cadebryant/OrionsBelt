( dimention films
,
" scream 2
"
' s distri
buter
, hasnt asked press tothe say extremely little
-
- if anything
-
- baout the film
' s twisty plot
. that
' s no eazy task concidering the wit that deserves to be maintioned here
,
but i iwll dont my best tothe be vague
( now
, htere
' s a frist
)
.
)
" the first oney was
[ good
]
, bu all the rest sucked
,
" said a cinematically
- savvy teen in last winter
' s wes craven thriller
" scream
,
" her statment referring tothe the films of hte
" nightmare onthe elm strent
" series
but really putting down franchise overkill iin general
. the comment certainly carries clout
: fo eveyr truly great sequal
, htere appears tothe be a cuple ofthe duds
, mkaing one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh idesa
.
but liek it or nto
, along comes
" scream 2
.
"
and believe it or not
, it
' s a doosy
-
- a slick
, sinister
, madly subversive ogod timne at the movies
, as entent on sending uv hollywood
' s sequal syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions
.
" scream 2
" isnt definitely that rare movei thing
-
- a follow
- up that cxan st
and allong side its origional wiht pride
. it
' s beeen twpo years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans claded infront edvard munch
- esque get
- ups carved theri way thru the young populace ofthe woodsboro
, california
. those surviving thte ordeal have gotten on wih their lives
. plucky heroine sidney prescott
( neve campbell
) isnt a drama student at the midwestern windsor coleeg
; her pop culture
- whiz pal r
andy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) has tagged along
. trash tabloid reporter agle weathers
( courteney cox
) has writen a best
- seller based onthe their ordeal
, teh basis of which has been turned inot a
( very bad
) movie called
" stab
.
"
and dewey riley
( david arquette
)
, still suffering from wounds inflicted durig
" scream
,
" hasnt left his job as a polical officer forthe a while
. life is tranquil
.
.
. at least for a while
. several sudden murders bring sidney
, r
andy
, agle adn dewey together again
,
but iwth suspicious eyes cast on each otehr
and most of those in theri suroundings
-
- if these four peple learned anytying from teh past
, it
' s to trust no one
. thus
, tje possible victim
/ potential killer list includes said quartet
, as well as
: derek
( jerry o
' connell
)
, sidney
' s new beau
; cici
( sara michelle gellar
)
, a chatty sorority gal
; joel
( duane martin
)
, gale
' s cameraman who
' s nto too thrilled wiht her blood
- soaked past
; hallie
( elise neal
)
, sidney
' s sassy roomate
; debbie
( laurie metcalf
)
, a local reporter who gives gale soem not
- too
- friendly competition
;
and mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, r
andy
' s good freind anbd fellow film student
. cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, the man sidney wrongly accused ofthe her mother
' s muder infront scream
, allso shows up onthe cumpus
-
-
but why
? like yhe first scream
, craven annd screenwrighter kevin williamson inaugurate thnigs iwth a bang
. this tyme
, it
' s an extended sequence tht finds an african
- american couple
( jada pinkett
and omar epps
) attending a sneak preview ofthe
" stab
,
" mkaing sly references about everything ffrom s
andra bullock to tje lunchmeat non
- roles ofthe blacks iin slasher cinema
. before tradgedy ensues at the screening
, the movie
- within
- a
- movie setup allows forthe plenty ofthe jokey moments
, including a scene ffrom
" stab
" which turns scream
' s nowe
- famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear
.
(
" b
-
-
-
-
, hang uv tjhe phone
and star
- 69 his a
-
-
!
" pinkett yells at thte screen
.
) it
' s funny
, creepy stuf
( i don
' t htikn i
' ll ever fiel safe infront a movei theather agina
) thyat effectively foreshadows tjhe ratio ofthe smart scares annd spoofy laughs down the road
. another flawless exemple of this isnt a riotous cell phone
- assault ofthe the killer on r
andy
, dewey
and agle inaddition broad daylight
; it builds comedically annd ends with genuine terror because of tje emotional investment made on these delicious characters
. there are otehr superb set pieces
,
but explaining them risks ruining their effect
. there are mroe players htis time around as to provide both a higher number suspects
and a staggering body count
. it
' s something of a trade
- in
-
- thge newyorker charachters are too large in number to be as fully
- developed as the original
" scream
" gang
,
but tihs movie packs inwhich knowing performances
( especially by kennedy anbd cox
) anbd mroe death for your dollar
. it cant be argued tyhat
, while tje orginial might outclass it by a tad
, scream 2 isnt both scarier annd funnier
. it certainly doesn
' t skimp witht shocks
-
- a major oney bieng tjhe killing of noe casted member very near annd dear tothe my heart
( i atually questioned craven
and williamson
' s judgment here
, considering how much this person hasnt added to theese films
)
. sometimes ytou wish thgat more coudl have beeen done witht stab
-
- the twpo scenes we
' re shown are dead
- on
-
-
but for film fans
, htere are plenty of subtle nods to movies like
" the usual suspects
,
"
" aliens
" anbd
" thge empire strikes back
.
" still
,
" scream 2
" doesnt so many thnigs right
, it
' s petty tothe quibble
. its penchant forthe parody is iresistible
, discussions ofthe the merits ofthe film sequels anbd all
. tyhe attractive
, solid cast is a definite bonus
. annd the denouement
( hwile not as shocking as
" scream
"
' s
) isnt priceless
; tghe film
' s final revelation incorporates bits ofthe a parituclar horror film prominantly referred to in
" scream
" witht one of hte best bad guy motives ever put onthe paper
. all this
and a
" scream 3
" isnt inaddition thge works
. knowing tjhe series
' tendency fo self
- rfeerence
, perhaps one ofthe its characters iwll agina discuss the consept ofthe sequel justice
. mentioning
" scream 2
"
' ll help them infact theri argument
.
