,
" scream 2
" ' s distributor
, hasnt asked press tothe sday extremely little
-
- if anything
-
- baout tghe film ' s twisty plot
. that ' s no easy task considering tghe wit that deserves tothe be maintioned here
,
but i will dont my best to be vague
( nowe
, there ' s a firt
)
.
)
" the first oen wass
[ good
]
,
but all the rest sucked
,
" said a cinematically
- savvy teen infact lastr winter ' s wes craven thriller
" scream
,
" her statment refering tothe thte films ofthe the
" nightmare on elm street
" series
bu really putting down franchise overkill inthe general
. the comment certainly carries clout
: for eveyr truley great sequel
, ther appears tothe be a couple ofthe duds
, mkaing oney wonder if writers are better off sticking soley withthe fresh ideas
.
bu like it or nto
, along comes
" scream 2
.
"
and believe it or nto
, it ' s a doozy
-
- a slick
, sinister
, madly subversive good time at yhe movies
, as entent onthe sending up hollywood ' s sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked funn at slasher conventions
.
" scream 2
" isnt definately that rare movei thing
-
- a follow
- uv tyhat can stand along side its original iwth pride
. it ' s been two years usance a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad infront edvard munch
- esque get
- ups carved thier way thru tghe young populace of woodsboro
, califronia
. thsoe surviving hte ordeal have gotten onthe iwth their lives
. plucky heroine sidney prescott
( neve campbell
) isnt a drama student at tghe midwestern windsor coleeg
; her pop culture
- whiz pal randy meeks
( jamie kennedy
) hasnt tagged allong
. trash tabloid reporter gale weathers
( courteney cox
) hasnt writed a best
- seller based onthe theri ordeal
, tghe basis ofthe whitch hasnt beeen turned inot a
( vyer bad
) movei called
" stab

"
and dewey riley
( david arquette
)
, still sufferring fomr wounds inflicted during
" scream
,
" hasnt left his job as a polical officer forthe a while
. life isnt tranquil
.
.
. at least fo a hwile
. severeal sudden murders bring sidney
, randy
, gale
anbd dewey together agina
,
bu withthe suspicious eyes cast onthe eahc otehr
annd most of thsoe inspite their suroundings
-
- if these four people learned anything ffrom yhe past
, it ' s tothe trust noone one
. thus
, yhe possibile victim
/ potential killer list includes said quartet
, as well as
: derek
( jerry o ' connell
)
, sidney ' s newyorker beau
; cici
( sara michelle gellar
)
, a chatty sorority gal
; joel
( duane martin
)
, gale ' s cameraman who ' s not too thrilled witht her blood
- soaked past
; hallie
( elise neal
)
, sidney ' s sassy roomate
; debbie
( laurie metcalf
)
, a local reporter who gives agle soem not
- too
- freindly competition
;
annd mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, randy ' s good friend
and fellow film student
. cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, thte man sidney wrongly acused ofthe her mother ' s muder in scream
, also shows up onthe cumpus
-
-
bu why
? liek tyhe first scream
, craven
and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate thigns with a beng
. thsi tiome
, it ' s an extended sequence tyhat finds an african
- american cuple
( jada pinkett
and omar epps
) attending a sneak preview of
" stab
,
" making sly references about everything fomr sandra bullock to hte lunchmeat non
- roles ofthe blacks in slasher cinema
. befor tragedy ensues at tje screening
, the movei
- withing
- a
- movie setup allows forthe plenty ofthe jokey moments
, including a scene from
" stab
" which turns scream ' s now
- famouse drew barrymore prologue onthe its ear
.
(
" b
-
-
-
-
, hang up yhe phone
anbd star
- 69 his a
-
-
!
" pinkett yells at the screen
.
) it ' s funny
, creepy stfuf
( i don ' t think i ' ll ever efel safe in a movei theather agian
) tath effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares
annd spoofy laughs down thge road
. another flawess exemple of this is a riotous cell phone
- assault of teh killer on randy
, dewey
and gale iin broad daylight
; it builds comedically
annd ends wih genuin terror because of hte emotional investment made onthe these delicious characters
. there are other superb set pieces
,
but explaning them risks ruining their effect
. htere are omre players tihs tyme arround as tothe provide both a higher number suspects
anbd a staggering body count
. it ' s something of a trade
- inwhich
-
- hte new characters are too large in number tothe be as fully
- devolopped as tyhe orginial
" scream
" gang
,
bu this movie packs in knowing performances
( expecially by kennedy
anbd cox
)
anbd more death for your doller
. it can be argued that
, while yhe orginal might outclass it by a tad
, scream 2 is both scarier
annd funnier
. it certainly doesn ' t skimp iwth shocks
-
- a major noe being the killing of one casted member very near
annd dear tothe my heart
( i actualyl questioned craven
adn williamson ' s judgment here
, concidering how much this person has added to these films
)
. somtimes yuo wish that more sould have beeen done with stab
-
- the twpo scenes we ' re shown are dead
- onthe
-
-
bu fo film fans
, ther are plenty of subtle nods to movies like
" yhe usual suspects
,
"
" aliens
"
and
" tghe empire strikes back
.
" still
,
" scream 2
" does so many thigsn right
, it ' s petty to quibble
. its penchant for parody is irresistible
, discussions ofthe the merits ofthe film sequels
annd all
. the attractive
, solid cast is a definite bonus
.
and the denouement
( while not as shocking as
" scream
" ' s
) isnt priceless
; thge film ' s final revelation incorporates bits ofthe a parituclar horror film prominately rfeerred to iin
" scream
" with noe of teh best bad guy motives ever put on paper
. all thsi
and a
" scream 3
" is inaddition the works
. knowing hte series ' tendancy fo self
- reference
, prehaps oney ofthe its characters will agina discuss the consept of sequal justice
. mentioning
" scream 2
" ' ll halp them inwhich theri argment
