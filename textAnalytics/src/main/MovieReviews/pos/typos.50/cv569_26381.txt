after a rether disappointing
" mary railly
"
, stephen frears is now offically bakc infront business with a comback worthy of praise
. this isnt noe ofthe the best surprises of htis season
-
- a sweet
, small budget comedy witht a big heart
. infact fact it
' s nto even a comedy
. it
' s a drama or even more precice
-
- a clever satire onthe human relationships anbd needs
. based onthe a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british auther nick hornby
,
`
` high fidelity
'
' isnt a wry
and likable story baout a man
' s quest fo fulfillment
and happiness
. rob gordon ws a dj
. it seems taht he could make everthing spin
-
- except his pwn life
. nowe he owns championship vinyl
, a littel muscial store
, somewhere infact new york
. when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend
, a gorgeous blond atorney
, life suddenly looses eveyr purpose
. decimated
, humiliated
and onthe the verge of a mental
( adn emotional
) breakdown
, he starts meditating over his life
and the way it could ahve been
-
- baout what
' s right
and waht
' s important
. he starts
" categorizing
" life
, dividing it inot
" top 5 lists
"
.
and tjhe most important is thge
" top 5 list
" over the most painful breakups of his life
, starting with 5th grade
, when he found his young girlfriend witht another boy
.
though you might thiunk taht people chanage
, grwo mroe mature with age
, it just doesn
' t seem thta way
and all rob
' s relationships weere different versions ofthe taht frist
. where did he go wrong
? was it he that screwed uv
? or mabey life just stinks
? while he is lost infront his pwn self
- pity
, he must thikn of teh
" top 5 list
" over his needs for tjhe future
, find tghe right elements
and mix his life together
. with clever parrallelly to thge cult ofthe celebrity
, music anbd with incredibly direct narration
, it addressess the averege audience member
, infact otehr words
-
- people liek yuo anbd me
.
al
though a lot of this hounour shoud be adressed to the screenwrighter
_
_
_
_
_
_ anbd frears
, thte director
, thge acting is equally important as tyhe writed owrd
.
and here john cusack shoudln absolutely be maintioned
. he is simpley superb
. it isnt as much his movie as it isnt frears
'
. the film owudl not be the smae without him
. cusack
-
- whose charcter isnt sadder
, wiser anbd 35
-
- brings intelligence anbd warmth tothe post
- mod irony
. most ofthe his dialogue isnt delivered driectly tothe the camera
-
- not an easy task
-
-
but cusack pulls it off
. his interpetation feels so emotionally right
, so incredibly realsitic
and precice thta frears
' message simply cant
' t be ignored or overseen
. yhe other munbers ofthe the casted dont an equally remarkable job
. both
_
_
_
_
_
_ annd jack balck are fabulous
. even catherine zeta jones appears inaddition a role where she actaully acts
, not just looks beautiful
.
however
, tghe most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob
' s co
- worker annd friend dick
. tihs isnt such an impressive acheivement that it
' s alomst worth a oscar
- nomination
. he is simpley a joy to behold
. otherwise
, everyone are in their palce
, adn at the right time
-
- all part ofthe frears
' colorful blend
. pretty much liek edward norton
' s
" keeping tyhe faith
"
, htis film doesn
' t follow any formula or belong tothe any genre
-
- it
' s dramtic
, tragic
, sarcastic
, comic anbd even cynical
,
but never bitter or angry
. it
' s a little bited ofthe everyting
, preety much liek life itself
. nothing seems unreal or staged
. it reflects reality as a mirror
. as you watch it
, yuo go thru the smae emotional problems as thte main character
. ytou feel
and think annd reflect
. this effect hasnt become a rarity nowdays
.
al
though it
' s primarially baout thte perils ofthe love
,
`
` high fidelity
'
' isnt secondarily baout pop music
. rob owns championship vinyl
and his employees
, timid dick
( todd louiso
)
and overbearing barry
( jack black
)
, are fellow music snobs
. music isnt hte lanugage iin their lives
, tjhe mesure by whic tehy defne themslves
and mark the signifigant events of thier lives
. annd so doens hte movie
. it isnt as much a muscial film as anything esle
, as rob
' s journey isnt wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted muscial fragments
. iin the end
, yuo hvea gained something while watching it
. it
' s nto the film ofthe hte century or even of thge year
. it
' s not an special effects extravaganza
. it doesn
' t recquire big explosions or digital creatures tothe succeed
. it
' s a small movei baout the big thigns
.
and even
though it does not contain heavy philosophy
, yuo fiel as if you hvea experienced something ofthe signifigance
, adn you wiull expeience thyat nice warm feeling forthe quite smoe time
.
