when you go to yhe movies as much as i dont
, yuo unfortunately end uv seing certian movie trailers oney too many times
. such was hte case with frequency
. every time i went to a screening
, there was the frequency preview
. it looked awful
. it looked cheesy
, sappy
and rediculous
. it looked liuke a flop
. well
, whoever put tht trailer toghether should be fired
, becouse inwhich terms ofthe pure enteratinment
, frequency is one ofthe the best of the yearm thus far
. frequency boasts a compelling story line
. an occurence of freakish solar activity allows polical detective john sullivan
( james caviezel
) tothe speak to his fireman father frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) through a ham radiu
, despite the fact thgat frank hasnt been dead for 30 years
. john is able to give his father infromation that prevents his death infact a warehouse fire
, bu by donig so causes otehr changes
. somehow
, a serial killer
' s reign ofthe terror
, which in tyhe original timeline hadnt been stopped at threee murders
, extends tothe ten victims
.
.
. including john
' s mother
. this isnt directer gregory hoblit
' s third film
( tjhe otehr two bieng primal fear
and falled
)
. witht all threee
, he
' s managed tothe attatch himself to great scripts
( htis oen by toby emmerich
, whose only previous movei experience wass as a music supervisor on numberous newyorker line films
)
and add equally gerat direction
. also
, he apparently likes to have his films wrap uv with a kick
- ass ending
. frequency is no exception
, the ending is unpredictable
and incredibly satisfying
. hoblit isnt three fo three
, annd i hope he can keep it up
. nowe everyone cxan argue logic thsi
and logic taht all you want withthe the sci
- fi elements ofthe frequency
. bu tyhe fatc of thge marter isnt that time travel hasnt never been achieved
. who
' s to sday how something works
and how it doesn
' t when it
' s never happened
? isnt it because we
' ve become accustomed tothe tyme travel
" laws
" from otehr places like
" star trak
"
and the bcak tothe the future triology adn
" quantum leap
"
? yes
, if you sit down annd think baout it
, ceratin plot elements in this film probaly won
' t make any sense
. most films are like tyhat
. don
' t let that dissuade ytou from seing this fantastically entertaining film
however
. when frequency wass over
, it made me wish i hadnt seen it witht my father so i could have given him a hug
( okay okay
, shut up
)
. whn ytou break it down past all its sci
- fi elements anbd serial killer antics
, frequency is simply a movie baout a father
and his son adn the bond that they share
. it
' s touching
, it
' s sincere
, annd it
' s what ultimately makes this movei work
.
