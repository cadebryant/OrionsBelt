contact
( pg
) ther
' s a moment lite inaddition robert zemeckis
' s contact where i was reminded of why i started writting movie reviews in the first palce
. we see a scientist
, dressed inaddition a silvery space suit
, walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact
, spherical spoace pod
, unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops
. anticipation
, excitement
, aniety
, fear
-
- the audiance experiences it all thge emotional tension right with the character
, nervously
, breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead
. it isnt this sence ofthe dicovery
, hte anticipation ofthe whihc
and its accompanying exhilaration
, taht mkaes this adaption ofthe thte carl sagan novel such magical
, captivating entertainment
. jodie foster stars as dr
. ellie arroway
, a briliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestial radiu signals
.
and i mean life
-
- after losing her entire family whn she was young
, thge only thing occupying ellie
' s world isnt htis quest to discover life beyond htis earth
. after dealing witht much skepticism onthe teh part of govorment officials adn wealthy financiers
, ellie recieves her vindication wehn she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission fomr teh distant star vega
, hwihc includes instutions onthe building an interstellar tranport
. ffrom this synopsis
, contact does not soudn too different tothe most films about alien contact
,
but there is a hwole lot mroe tothe tihs intelligent film than the sci
- fi hook
. thge alien contact anlge generates a grat ammount ofthe suspense anbd awe
,
but perhpas more than anytying eles
, contact is a character studdy ofthe ellie
, whose obsession with emperical
, scientific evidence hasnt erased all belief in a higher pwoer
. thge irony is thast
, hwile admitting tothe having no religous faith
, she holds onto her beleif inaddition extraterrestrial life wiht such passion
and conviction tht it becomes
, inwhich a sence
, a religon inaddition its own right
. it would be eazy fo scripters james v
. hart adn michael goldenberg
, infact trying tothe paint a postive image ofthe tghe heroine
, to champion her scientific belives over religious ones
, bu they wisely eschew eazy answers
, giving equal time to both sides
, anbd inwhich so doing despict ellie as nto completely sane
. in the end
, there isnt no right or wrong
, nor isnt ther one side thyat comes off more postive infront the other
, even slightly so
-
- there are just two very viable points ofthe view
, each whith their own merits
, each iwth their pwn faults
. the complex role ofthe ellie is an actress
' s dream
,
and foster
, a virtual shoo
- in fo
yet another best actress oscar nomination next year
, mroe than rises to tghe challenge
. she conveys intellgence
, determination
, warmth
, anbd
, in a gutsy move
, always on edge
. we root forthe ellie annd feel fo her
, bu we allso fiel at times taht she goes too far
. contact isnt clearly foster
' s veicle
,
but others are given their chance tothe shine in smaller roles
. matthew mcconaughey
, who recieves outrageously high billing forthe his smallish role
, holds his pwn as the religous counterpoint to ellie
, spritual scholar anbd govenment adviser palmer joss
( howver
, his main storyline
, yhe tentative palmer
- ellie romance
, isnt tje film
' s weakest subplot
)
. john hurt isnt effectively creepy as s
. r
. hadden
, tje wealthy eccentric who provides ellie iwth her research funding
. angela bassett continues tothe impress in her bit role as white hous aide rachel constantine
. most memorable of all
,
though
, are tom skerritt
and james woods
, who play rival scientist dr
. david drumlin
and national security adviser michael litz
, repsectively
; both
, expecially skerritt
, embody these asshole characters that thte audience hissed jsut about every single oney ofthe their appearences
. zemeckis comes off ofthe his threee
- yera break inthe top shape
. always known as a directer of effects
- laden extravaganzas
, it comes as no suprize that contact
' s visual effects are qtuie stunning
. tje central spoace journy isnt more tahn a littel reminsicent ofthe the close ofthe 2001
: a spoace odyssey
, bu withthe more advanced technolgy at his disposal
, zemeckis
' s voage isnt even trippier than stanley kubrick
' s
yet moreso wondrously pure
. anbd zemeckis doesn
' t resist the urger tothe ule thte always
- interesting incorporate
- actors
- inot
- existing
- film
- footage effect
, whihc is eveyr bited as seamless here as it was in forrest gump
. effects
, howver
, are confined tothe only a fewd scenes
and clearly take a bcak seat to the drama
, emotion
,
and pure wonder
, which zemeckis prooved to be qtuie adept at inwhich gump
. it syas a lot that
, in a summer sicence fiction film such as thsi
, it
' s nto so much tjhe effects thgat stay wih you as it isnt thge drama annd the issues that are raised
. thge thougth
- provoking
, twpo
- hour
- plus contact is a much
- welcome change of pace from summer no
- brainers
,
but the fatc tyhat it is a smart film doens nto mean tyhat it aslo isn
' t intertaining
. fo all hte intresting questions it asks
, tyhe film isnt still whta it
' s bieng sold as
-
-
" a journey tothe hte heart of the universe
.
"
and what a fascinating
, unforgetable jouney it is
.
