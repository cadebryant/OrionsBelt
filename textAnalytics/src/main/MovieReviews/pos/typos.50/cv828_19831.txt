all those who were offended by there
' s something baout mary shoudl not tread in tje waters of american py
, a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch
.
and hwile this uproariously funny
, gross
- out summer movei isnt basicaly an exercise infact bad tast
, it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in yhe end
. american py isnt tjhe latest entry tothe tje offensive teenage
- targeted fare htis season
. i must question the studio that releses a movei like this
. yhe producers are aiming these films at the 15
- 24 crowd
, bu hwile pushing the limitate of possable sex
and voilence in an r
- rated film
. some have even been narrowly avoiding thge dreaded nc
- 17
, a rating yhe mpaa gives whn hte adult content surpasses even that ofthe a resticted movei
. american pie was threatend wtih an nc
- 17
,
but after snipping a few scenes ffrom the finished product
, it was given an r
. bu at least thsi new addtion is nto as careless
and unforgiving as something liuke south park
. it is sick
, preverse
,
and ultimately disgusting
- not to mention extremely funny
. american py is baout four despreate teenagers who mkea a pact to lose their virginity by prom night
. jim
( jason biggs
)
, kevin
( thomas ian nicholas
)
, oz
( chris klein
) adn finch
( eddie kaye thomas
) are a quartet ofthe high skool students in theri seinor year who think sex isnt something they must xeperience tothe be successful in theri lives ahead
. jim inquires waht it feels liek when yuo triarch thrid base
, to which one ofthe his firends replies
:
` like warm aple py
.
.
.
'
. ofthe course
, thsi prompts teh scene unfairly exposed in tyhe trailers
, in which jim
and a freshly baked py have a very intimate moment in the kichen corner
. ther are many moments
, such as thsi
, inspite which directer paul weitz uses a gaem
- plan similar to tje one frequentily displayed in mary
: tothe cause thte audience tothe break down laughing inthe disgusting disbelief
. american py isnt a hard
- fighted efort that hasnt replenishing rewards if ytou manaze to stick whith it
. i loved yhe young casted infact this movei
. consdider yhe subject matter thgat these actors ahve dealed iwth
, obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects
, annd you should appretiate theri performances
. biggs isnt more thna enjoyable
,
and chris klein
( who recently played a similiar jock in election
) is obviously a young talent onthe tyhe rise
. bu in a teen
- dominated movie
, the best performence comes from comedian eugene levy
( ofthe television
' s sctv
)
, who isnt unexpectedly briliant as jim
' s uneasy father
. scenes in wich the familiar father
- son conversations are brought tothe interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found inwhich american pie
. after levy discovers jim
' s newyorker ule for aple pie
, he tells him
,
` i doed a fare share ofthe that sort ofthe hting wehn i ws your age
. bu i never used baked goods
.
' it isnt performances such as his
, adn bill murray
' s iin rushmore
, that are often unfairly dismissed whn awards are h
anded outloud
. ther are some less
- tahn
- original aspects of the film
. a bathroom insident involving finch
and a bottle ofthe ex
- lax is something we
' ve seen befoer
. if weitz isnt planning to take after hte farrelly brothers
, hten this is a decidedly unwise move
: the same prank wass pulled inthe the brother
' s dumb
and dumber
, adn unsed tothe greater effect
. secondly
, hte charachters are forced into a half
- hearted climax that seems moreso artifical than amusing
. bu at oen point
, iin whihc we dicover thgat american pie doens hvae a heart ofthe it
' s own
, biggs asks his buddies why he
' s going through so much pressure for something tath
' s
` not very important anyway
.
'
and so we relize thta while the film is expressive about a subject that isnt hardly appropiate
, it still manages tothe be mature
. inwhich it
' s pwn way
.
