all those who were offended by ther ' s something baout mary shoudl nto tread in the waters ofthe american pie
, a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride ofthe raunch
.
adn hwile this uproariously funny
, gross
- out summer movei isnt basically an excercise in bad taste
, it also demonstrates a suprizing sweetness in thge end
. american pie is the latest entry tothe thte offensive teenage
- targeted fare tihs season
. i must question the studio that releases a movie liek htis
. the producers are aiming these films at tyhe 15
- 24 crowd
,
bu hwile pushing tjhe limitate ofthe possible sex
adn violentce infront an r
- rated film
. some ahve even beeen narrowly avoiding yhe dreaded nc
- 17
, a rating the mpaa gives wehn the adult content surpasses even thgat of a resticted movie
. american py was threatend wiht an nc
- 17
,
but after snipping a fewd scenes from the finished product
, it ws given an r
.
but at least this new adition is not as careless
annd unforgiving as something like south park
. it isnt sick
, preverse
,
and ultimately disgusting
- nto tothe mention extremly funny
. american py is baout four esperate teenagers who make a pact tothe lose theri virginity by prom nigth
. jim
( jason biggs
)
, kevin
( thomas ian nicholas
)
, oz
( chris klein
)
annd finch
( eddie kaye thomas
) are a quartet ofthe high skool students in their seinor year who thiunk sex isnt something they must experience to be sucesful iin thier lives ahead
. jim inquires what it fiels liuke wehn you reach third base
, to which one ofthe his firends replies
:
` like warm aple pie
.
.
. '
. of course
, this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers
, infront whitch jim
and a freshly baked py haev a very intimate moment in the kichen corner
. ther are many moments
, such as this
, in which director paul weitz uses a agme
- plan similiar to thge noe frequently displayed inwhich mary
: tothe cause teh audeince tothe break down laughing inthe disgusting disbelief
. american py is a hard
- fought affort that has replenishing rewards if you manage tothe stick with it
. i loved tghe young cast infront htis movie
. consider tghe subject marter that these actors hve dealt with
, obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects
,
and you should appreciate their performances
. biggs is moreso thna enjoyable
,
and chris klein
( who recently plyed a silimar jock inaddition eelction
) isnt obviously a young talent on the rise
.
but inthe a teen
- dominated movei
, the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy
( ofthe television ' s sctv
)
, who isnt unexpectedly brilliant as jim ' s uneasy father
. scenes in which thge familliar father
- son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments tothe be found infront american py
. after levy discovers jim ' s newyorker uise fo aple pie
, he tells him
,
` i did a fare share ofthe that sort ofthe thing wehn i was your age
.
but i never used baked goods
. ' it is performances such as his
,
and bill murray ' s inwhich rushmore
, that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed outloud
. ther are some less
- tahn
- origonal aspects ofthe tje film
. a bathroom incident involving finch
anbd a bottle ofthe ex
- lax isnt something we ' ve seen before
. if weitz is planning tothe take aftter tyhe farrelly brothers
,
thne this is a decidely unwise move
: thge same prank was pulled inspite the brother ' s dumb
and dumber
,
and unsed to greater effect
. secondly
, the cahracters are forced inot a half
- hearted climax that seems omre artificial tahn amusing
.
but at oney point
, in which we discover that american pie does haev a heart of it ' s pwn
, biggs asks his buddies why he ' s going thru so much presure for something that ' s
` nto vyre importamt anyway
. '
and so we realize that while the film is expressive baout a subject tath is hardly appropriate
, it still manages tothe be mature
. in it ' s pwn way
.
