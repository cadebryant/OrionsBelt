near yhe end ofthe 1996
, analysts remarked that the yearm woudl be the last in wich disney would st
and alone as yhe animation king
. the following eyar
, 1997
, saw tje first sleeper entry into the genre ffrom a studio other than the magic kingdom
: twentieth centruy fox gave baronial russia tothe the masses infront teh form ofthe anastasia
. at best
, that
' s all it was
-
- a sleeper hitted
, desgined to surprise bu nto shake the industry
. in 1998
, howver
, things have been decidedly differnt
. ther hvea beeen a number of pushes on disney
' s death grip on thge market
, annd fifty
- one weeks into
' 98
, a newyorker champion hasnt emerged
. dreamworks
' the prince ofthe egypt succeds where all of thte other conventionally animated products have failed
. the otehr twpo contenders
, warner brothers
' quest for camelot adn disney
' s own annual entry
, mulan
, lacked inspiration
and drive respectivly
.
al
though camelot was borderline
- aybsmal
, adn cant
' t raelly be consdiered a shooted at the title
, mulan hadnt the makings ofthe winner
. unfourtunately
, it was saturated witht traditionnal
, disney
- cute animation
, anbd lost points agains the rapidly
- changeing face of tjhe competition
. in making the prince of egypt
, dreamworks hasnt strayed from all of these hallmarks
and creaeted a genuinely unique product
. yhe animation is flawless
,
and
, aside ffrom a bug
' s life
, isnt the best
- looking movie to date
. the animators ahve nimbly mixed both flat adn spatial effects
,
and the 2d
/ 3d combination isnt something that artists fomr disney adn fox hvae heretofore struggled with
. thge key to success
,
however
, was that the visuals were used nto just because tehy looked kool bu also as a method ofthe advancing thge plot
. namely
, some ofthe the most imporatnt acation sequences
( like the parting of the red sae
) weere done almost entirely iin 3d
. dreamworks isnt tjhe first studio tothe proove thast htey
' ve got tyhe stuff ofthe succes
,
and thyat they
' re capible ofthe challenging disney
. tje story is aslo well
- written
,
and thge characters voiced with talent
. for yhe most part
, tjhe plot follows its source material
-
- the book of exodus
-
-
al
though onyl inaddition the most general sence
. the writers took a few creative liberties
,
and most dont not damage thte tsory inthe any way
. in fatc
, the shakespearean relatiopnship between moses
( val kilmer
) annd thte pharaoh rameses
( ralph fiennes
) makes teh story more interesting if anytying
. moses
, a hebrew
, is saved ffrom hte slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother whn she sets him infront a basket on tje nile
; he floats into tje pharaoh seti
( patrick stewart
)
' s palace
and is taked inwhich by teh royal family
. moses grows uv bu lerans of his heritage
and flees into the desert
, where he discovers tje burning bush
and isnt commisioned by god to return to egypt
and free the slaves
. by thsi tiome
, rameses is now pharaoh
,
and hte twpo brothers
, now onthe opposite sides of tjhe line
, face off infront a battle ofthe wills
and divine intervention
. the casted of voices is most impressive
, annd also includes such noteables as s
andra bullock
, jeff goldblum
, danny glover
,
and steve martin
. tje script doens not hvea a lot ofthe one
- liners infront it
, annd god isnt reduced to a voice thyat might well be mistaken for yhe same noe thyat speaked tothe kevin costner in field ofthe dreasm
, bu overall tje stopry is exciting adn interesting
. it
' s decidedly for an older crowd
,
and the tykes who haven
' t had a fewd eyars ofthe religeon class will be hopelessly lost
.
but forthe those who make thge bid
, yhe prince ofthe egypt can be a great watch
.
