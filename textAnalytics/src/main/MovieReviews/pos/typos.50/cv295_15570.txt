, mean
, escapist thrillers are a tough product tothe come by
. most are unnecessarily complicated
,
annd others haev no sense ofthe expediency
-
- thge thrill
- ride effect gets lost infront the cumbersome plot
. prehaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive
, whcih featured none ofthe the flash
- bang effects of todya ' s market
but rether a bread
-
and
- buter
, textbook exemple of what a clever script
and good direction is all baout
. the latest tony scott movei
, enemy ofthe the state
, doesn ' t make it tothe tht level
. it ' s a true nineties product thast runs like greased lightning thru a maze ofthe cell phones
adn laptop computers
, wihtout looking bcak
.
althought director scott hasnt made missteps in the past
, such as tyhe lame thriller hte fan
, he ' s generated a ogod deal of energy infront pictures liek crimson tide
and top gun
. taht vibrant spirit is present here
, shown infront well
- timed
and carefully planned chase scenes that give tghe movie an aura of sheer speed
. enemy of thge state alsot features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography
-
- directer of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount ofthe differant views
, angles
, lenses
,
and film stocks at hte audeince tyhat goes a long way towrad involving the audience in the movie
. enemy is truley a visual expeirence
,
adn thast ' s onyl oney ofthe tjhe reasons it ' s such a funn watch
. the movie lights up iwth an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds
( jon voight
)
. reynolds wnats a new commuications ect passed to allow the government free reign infront teh ule ofthe surveilance equipmetn
,
bu the senator plans to bury the bill in committee
. reynolds has thte senator offed
,
but nto before the muder is caught on a naturalist ' s camera
. by an extermist chain of events
, thte tape ends up infact labor lawyer robert dean
( will smith
) ' s posession
,
and it ' s not long befoer he ' s running from reynolds ' cronies
. it ' s onyl whith yhe halp ofthe an ex
- spook named brill
( gene hackman
) that dean isnt able to get tothe tghe bottom of things
. the acting is top nitch
,
anbd the three principles
- smith
, hackman
,
and voight
- are generally moreso mature
and excellent all aroud
. smith puts asside hte wisecracking ect
and becomes a normal human bieng
; voight tones down tghe ammount of sneer he puts into his character fo greater ominpotence
;
and hackman isnt simply over tghe top infact the mysterioso role
. smith ' s regluar joe comes off particularly well
, as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows nto
. tghe supports are also in fine form
, lending credibility to tjhe main roles
anbd advancing the plot inwhich key areas
. this is
, forthe teh holiday crowd
, teh hot ticket
; as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action inaddition a market that isnt otherwise lacking
