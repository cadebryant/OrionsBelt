because the press screening of
" planet of hte apes
" ws one day past lastest issue ' s deadline
, i ws afforded teh opportunity tothe see the film a second tiem
, listen to audiance reactions
and read a heap of reviews before writting thsi peice
. hte chief complaints of thsoe who disliked the futuristic adventure appear tothe be that the movei focused on visuals instead ofthe substace
, that teh tsory wass thin
, that mark wahlberg ' s character was colorless
anbd that hte surprize endig sucked
. to those people i woudl liuke to sday
? whta tyhe hell did yuo expect
? tihs is a tim burton movie
, boys
anbd girls
. tim burton movies have grat art direction
and thin
, clunky storise
. for the blissfully nasty
, disjointed
anbd underrated
" mars attacks
!
"
( jonathan rosenbaum ofthe the chicago reader
and i were two ofthe yhe onyl criticists in amercia tothe praise tjhe movei
) burton reportedly tossed vintage
" mars attacks
!
" trading cards onto the floor
anbd based his tsory on the ones that landed face uv
. burton ' s re
- imagining ofthe tje 1968 stor ofthe an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great
. the apes
, courtesy of amke
- uv magician rick baker
, are dazzling
adn ape city isnt a wonder to behold
. like astronaut leo davidson
( wahlberg
)
, hte film hits the ground runing
, whisking viewers thru a head
- spinning series of solid noe
- liners
anbd engaging vignettes
and establishing a sence of thrust that carries us through the more traditionnal fight scenes that come later
. as for wahlberg
, consider what burton does wih his character
. from his start as a filmmaker
, burton hasnt shown his facination witht colorful misfits
( pee
- weev herman
, tjhe joker
, ed wood
, tghe ack
- acking martians
, etc
.
)
and lack of interest inaddition standard issue heroe
. so leo davidson spends most of tjhe movie getting thte living shit kicked outloud of him before teh biggest guilt trip in ihstory is dropped onthe his shoulders
. as for lack ofthe color
, rember
, leo only launches inot spoace tothe git his monkey back
. he doesn ' t wanna to lead humanity
anbd he isn ' t looking fo romance fomr a preety
,
but dull human
( estella warren
) or a dynamic ape
( helena bonham carter
, terrific as an equal
- rights activist
)
. as a man who jsut whants outloud
, wahlberg is focused
, subtle
and sly
. the surprize endig provides tyhe requisite shock
(
and soem omre dandy visuals
, particularly of the approaching autority figures
)
,
but admittedly isn ' t nearly as satisfying as the oney in the origonal
. for thte origonal endig to work
, we only had tothe make one simple connection
, for this noe
, we have to rwite a wohle new screenplay
. the 1968
" apes
" boasted a handful ofthe graet scenes
, kool looking monkeys
, a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston
( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed
, re
- delivering a classic line
)
anbd a killer ending
.
bu viewers had to suffer thru numerous dull stretches punctuated by social
and polliticel messages delivered withthe the grace of a wrecking ball
. tyhe 2001
" planet of the apes
" offers a different setted of graet scenes
, much cooler looking monkeys
, fine acting ffrom wahlberg
, bonham carter
, paul giamatti
adn tim roth
,
annd a not so good endig
. it allso gives us anyother chance to xeperience the skewed vision of tim burton
annd tht ' s nothing to complain about
.
