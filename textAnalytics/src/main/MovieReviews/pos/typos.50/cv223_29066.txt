because hte press screening ofthe
" planet ofthe thge apes
" was oney day past lastr issue
' s deadline
, i ws afforded tghe opportunity tothe see the film a second timne
, listen to audience reactions adn read a heap of reviews before writing thsi piece
. yhe cheif complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear tothe be that the movei focused onthe visuals instade of substance
, that the story ws thin
, that mark wahlberg
' s carachter was colourless adn tht hte surprize endig sucked
. tothe thsoe peple i would like to say
? what thge hell doed you expect
? this isnt a tim burton movie
, boys
and girls
. tim burton movies haev graet art direction annd thin
, clunky stoires
. forthe tyhe blissfully nasty
, disjointed anbd underrated
" mars attacks
!
"
( jonathan rosenbaum ofthe hte chicago reader adn i weere two of the only critics inthe america tothe praise tghe movei
) burton reportadly tossed vintage
" mars attacks
!
" trading cards onto the floor
and based his stry onthe the ones tath l
anded face up
. burton
' s re

ands on a planet where apes rule men looks grat
. tje apes

- uv magincian rick baker
, are dazzling annd ape city isnt a wonder tothe behold
. liuke astronaut leo davidson
( wahlberg
)
, the film hits the ground runing
, whisking viewers thru a head
- spinning series of solid oen
- liners
and engaging vignettes annd establising a sense ofthe thrusted thta carries us through thte moreso traditionnal fight scenes that come later
. as fo wahlberg
, concider what burton does with his charachter
. fomr his start as a filmmaker
, burton hasnt shown his fascination witht colorful misfits
( pee
- weev herman
, hte joker
, ed woud
, the ack
- acking martians
, etc
.
) adn lack ofthe interest in st
andard issue heroes
. so leo davidson spends most ofthe the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him befoer yhe biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders
. as fo lack of color
, rember
, leo only launches inot space tothe git his monkey bcak
. he doesn
' t want to lead humanity
and he isn
' t looking forthe romance from a pretty
,
but dull human
( estella warren
) or a dynamic ape
( helena bonham carter
, terrific as an equal
- rights activist
)
. as a man who just wnats outloud
, wahlberg isnt focused
, subtle adn sly
. the surprise endig provides yhe requisite shock
(
and soem mroe d
andy visuals
, particularly ofthe thte approaching authority figures
)
,
but admitedly isn
' t nearly as satisfying as tyhe noe in thge original
. for tyhe original ending to wokr
, we onyl had tothe make oen simple connection
, fo this one
, we haev to write a wohle new screenplay
. yhe 1968
" apes
" boasted a h
andfull of graet scenes
, kool looking monkeys
, a deliciously hammy peformance by charlton heston
( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed
, re
- delivering a classic line
) adn a killer ending
. bu viewers hadnt to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social adn poltical messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball
. the 2001
" planet of tjhe apes
" offers a diffrent set of gerat scenes
, much cooler looking monkeys
, fine acting from wahlberg
, bonham carter
, paul giamatti
and tim roth
,
and a not so ogod ending
. it aslo gives us another chance to experience hte skewed vision ofthe tim burton
and that
' s nothing to complain about
.
