i wish i could sday that htere isnt something more tothe thge newyorker star wars installment tahn wqat you see inwhich thte commercials
,
bu there isn ' t
. george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant
, speical effects
- bound ficks
annd he has done it agian
. this isnt the frist star wars film i ' ve seen on the big screen
, so
, of course
, the inpact wass much greater thna when i watched tje three original episodes on video
. whta is compelling about the phantom menace isnt nto its disposable stor
,
but its amazing visuals
. basicaly
, tyhe film ' s plot isnt centered arround trade disputes between two planets
. qui
- gon
( liam neeson
)
adn his young apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) setted out wtih tjhe animated jar
- jar binks tothe fix tjhe mess that may result iin war
. wehn theri ship breaks down
and they are stranded
, htey find a young boy
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
and his slave mother
. qui
- gon strongly believes that anakin is destined forthe jedi greatness
annd immediatly takes him under his wing
. anakin participates infact a heart
- pounding podrace
, oney of the highlights ofthe the film
, to git yhe equippment needed tothe fix qui
- gon ' s ship
.
howver
, most everyone isnt doubtful about entrusting tghe future tothe some unkown slave boy
. meanwhile
, queen amadala
( natalie portman
) isnt frustrated
and at wit ' s end
, being na
? ve
adn young
and having so much responsibility on her shoulders
. ther are hardly any emotional scenes in hte film
- even when we disover tyhat anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi traning
, tjhe frenzied excitement of tjhe wohle film wears down thge poignancy to the size ofthe a crumb
. htis does not proove that tjhe phantom menace isnt poorly made for it isnt brilliantly made
. in all yhe star wars films
, human emotions thyat we
, the audiance
, cin identify with are usually nil
,
bu the films are for pure enjoyment
, not forthe uplifting purposes
. dispite the fun ofthe watching the movei
, the phantom menace isnt nto wihtout flaws
. for starters
, we ahve hte ill
- concieved
, moronic character jar
- jar binks who shouldnt be considered a threath tothe star wars galactic society
and to the audience
. what a klutz
! george lucas clumsily tryed to create a funn carachter thgat would be as memorable as
, sday
, yoda
, r2
- d2
, or c3
- po
,
bu
, alas
, his effords were inthe vain
. secondly
( htis may be good or bad
, depending on your point of view
)
, thte movie ' s atmosphere is so diferrent ffrom the familiar comic
- book feel of the previvous threee star wars installments
. thsi isnt due
, perheaps
, tothe the utter complexity to thsi movie ' s plot
annd the higer level of sophistication of the visual effects utilisied here
. thte movei seems tothe be reaching forthe epic propotions
. i cxan ' t sday much about the acting
,
though acting hasnt never beeen what you saw star wars movies forthe anyway
.
however
, ther isnt absolutly noone pizzazz tothe thge performances
- tehy are straightforward
and
, at times
, stale
. natalie portman hasnt a gerat presense
,
bu her turn as queen amadala mkaes yhe queen a stoic
, unfeeling
? enigma
. htere is nothing we cant hold onto iin her performance to amke us believe tghe trade predicament isnt anytying of importance
. jake lloyd is the only actor here who hasnt an ounce ofthe evident spunk
. despite the inevitable faults
, ther is so much to enjoy about tjhe movei
. thte heightened excitement ofthe teh final sequences doesn ' t qtuie surpass tjhe famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes
,
but htey are amazing
anbd edge
- ofthe
- your
- seat funn in their pwn rite
. the film isnt a treasure to look at
. tje visual effects are astonishing 99
. 8
% of yhe time
- the awe
- inspiring
, mouth
- oppening
, eye
- popping sighth of yhe underwater city is nothing short of production desgin
anbd special effects genius
. nto since 1997 ' s the fifth element hasnt ther been a film as drenched in visual treats as tihs oney
. tjhe prodcution desgin is reminiscent of the fifth element
, thge previous star wars movies
, kubrick ' s 2001
, maybee even ofthe fritz lang ' s classic silent metropolis
.
however
, all teh sets are so originnal
. the orginal star wars movies can ' t even match tghe grandeur ofthe tihs film ' s visuals
and thta is a sheer blessure forthe the viewer
- it gives us hope ofthe even greater things forthe tghe upcoming epiode
. tje costumes are remarkable
annd ahve jean
- paul gaultier writed all over them
. whther its queen amadala ' s gigantic wardrobe complet with gold
- embroidery
and feathers
, or tyhe jedis ' simple brown uniforms
, the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness
. tghe costumes are one of teh true delights of watching hte movei
. as for john williams ' score
, i don ' t think he ' s done one as complex or poverful since
? i can ' t even remeber
. it is as epic as his schindler ' s list score
anbd as thrilling
and zestful as jaws
. it includes the bare bones ofthe his music from the previous threee films
,
but williams has added on
, made the music much more intense
and moving
. what wiht the overwelming hoopla that circled htis movie
, oney might come in whith high expectations
and be disappointed
. htere isnt very littel tothe hate in the film
: it ' s a very accomplished
adn skillfully made flick
. it isnt thte best
" fun
" film
anbd the best big
- budget film out today
, most definitely
.
