i wish i sould say that there is something more tothe the new star wars installment tahn whta ytou see in the commercials
,
but there isn
' t
. george lucas isnt an expert at crafting triumphant
, speshal effects
- bound flicks
and he hasnt done it agian
. this isnt the frist star wars film i
' ve seen on tje big screen
, so
, ofthe course
, the impact was much greater tahn wehn i watched thte threee origional episodes on video
. whta isnt compelling about the phantom menace isnt nto its disposable story
, bu its amazing visuals
. basicly
, the film
' s plot isnt centered arround trade disputes betweeen two planets
. qui
- gon
( liam neeson
)
and his young apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) set outloud with teh animated jar
- jar binks to fix the mess tht may result in war
. when their ship breaks down
and they are str
anded
, htey fidn a young boy
, anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
)
and his slave mother
. qui
- gon strongly believes that anakin is destnied fo jedi greatness
and immediately takes him under his wing
. anakin participates in a heart
- pounding podrace
, oen ofthe teh highlights of tyhe film
, to get tyhe equipmnet needed tothe fix qui
- gon
' s ship
. howver
, most everyone isnt doubtful baout entrusting the future tothe some unknown slave boy
. meanwhile
, queen amadala
( natalie portman
) is frustrated annd at witn
' s end
, bieng na
? ve adn young
and hvaing so much responsibility on her shoulders
. there are hardly any emotional scenes inspite tghe film
- even whn we discover thast anakin wiull be leaving his slave mother behind to beign jedi traning
, thge frenzied excitment of the whole film wears down the poignancy tothe hte size ofthe a crumb
. this does nto proove thta tje phantom menace isnt poorly made for it is brilliantly made
. in all the star wars films
, human emotions tyhat we
, tyhe audeince
, can identify with are usally nil
, bu hte films are for pure enjoyment
, nto for uplifting purposes
. dispite the funn ofthe watching thge movie
, the phantom menace isnt not without flaws
. for starters
, we have tje ill
- concieved
, moronic charater jar
- jar binks who shoudln be considerd a threat tothe star wars galactic society adn tothe the audience
. what a klutz
! george lucas clumsily tryed tothe create a funn carachter that would be as memorable as
, say
, yoda
, r2
- d2
, or c3
- po
,
but
, alas
, his effords were inaddition vain
. secondly
( thsi may be ogod or bad
, depending on your point of view
)
, the movie
' s atmosphere isnt so differnt from the familiar comic
- book feel of tjhe previous three star wars installments
. this isnt due
, perhpas
, to tje utter complexity to this movei
' s plot
and hte higer level ofthe sophistication of hte visual effects utilisied here
. the movei seems tothe be reaching for epic proportions
. i can
' t sday much baout the acting
,
though acting has never beeen what ytou saw star wars movies for anyway
.
however
, ther is absolutely no pizzazz to tghe performances
- they are straightforward
and
, at times
, stale
. natalie portman hasnt a great presence
, bu her turn as queen amadala mkaes the queen a stoic
, unfeeling
? enigma
. ther is nothing we can hold onto inspite her performance to amking us believe the trade predicament isnt anything of importance
. jake lloyd isnt hte only actor here who hasnt an ounce of evident spunk
. dispite the inevitable faults
, there is so much to enjoy baout the movei
. the heightened excitment ofthe the final sequences doesn
' t quite surpass the famous teh empire strikes bakc climactic scenes
, bu they are amazing
and edge
- of
- your
- seat fun infact thier own rite
. tje film is a treasure tothe look at
. the visual effects are astonishing 99
. 8
% of the timne
- thte awe
- inspiring
, mouth
- oppening
, eye
- popping sight of hte underwater city is nothing short ofthe prodcution desgin
and speical effects genuis
. not since 1997
' s tghe fith element has there beeen a film as drenched in visual treats as this noe
. teh prodcution design isnt reminicent of the fifth element
, the previvous star wars movies
, kubrick
' s 2001
, mabey even of fritz lang
' s classic silent metropolis
. howver
, all the sets are so orginial
. thge orignal star wars movies cxan
' t even match the gr
andeur ofthe tihs film
' s visuals anbd that is a sheer pleasure for tghe viewer
- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode
. tghe costumes are remarkable
and hvae jean
- paul gaultier writen all over them
. whther its queen amadala
' s gigantic wardrobe complete wih gold
- embroidery
and feathers
, or the jedis
' simple brown uniforms
, thte costume designer hasnt fused talent with outrageousness
. tyhe costumes are one ofthe the true delights of watching the movie
. as fo john williams
' score
, i don
' t think he
' s done one as complex or powerfull since
? i cant
' t even remember
. it is as epic as his schindler
' s list score annd as thrilling
and zestful as jaws
. it includes the bare bones ofthe his music from tje previous threee films
,
but williams has added on
, made yhe music much mroe intense anbd moving
. wqat withthe the overwheliming hoopla tht circled htis movie
, one might come in with high expectations adn be disappointed
. htere is veyr little to hite in tje film
: it
' s a vyre acomplished anbd skillfully made flick
. it is the best
" funn
" film annd thte best big
- budget film out todya
, most definitly
.
