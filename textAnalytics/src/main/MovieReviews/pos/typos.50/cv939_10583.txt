scream 2
, like its precedessor
, isnt a genre
- crossing film
. it is about 50
% horror film
and 50
% muder mistery
. thge mix worked very well last time
and it continues tothe entertain tihs tiome
. scream was also known for its self
- referential tone
. many inside jokes were made in refeernce tothe horror movies
annd wes craven
. agina
, scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such thnigs as
" sequels suck
"
and
" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels
.
" scream 2 ' s stor isnt vrey similar tothe it ' s predecessor ' s
. sidney
( neve campbell
)
, having survived the killing spree in scream
, isnt now in coleeg
. agle weathers
( courteney cox
) hasnt writen a book about the murders
and that book is now bieng released as a feature film
, called stab
( which fo all practial purposes is tghe real
- world movei scream
)
. at tjhe premiere ofthe stab
, two students ffrom sidney ' s coleeg are stabbed to death
,
annd a new story beigns
. the press descends on sidney
and her coleeg to get the scoop on this sequal killer
. they whant to nkow all baout the links between stab
, sidney
,
adn the recent murders
. teh most complex self
- reference i saw
( thsi should be an olympic event
) was the scene where agle weathers was asking questions at a press confrence
. the rest of the press was watching
and videotaping weathers
. the otehr survivors from scream weere watching
anbd videotaping yhe press
. the audiance was watching yhe whole
, filmed scene
.
( wiew
.
) thge movie is packed wiht layers
and self
- references taht make it a pleasure tothe watch
. even better would be tothe watch a doulbe feature of scream
and scream 2
. thta ' s nto tothe sday that these refernces necessarily make scream 2 a deepo
, or even a good movei
. the just add to tjhe fun of watching it
. i recommend it fo otehr reasons as well
. what i liekd best baout the horror aspect of teh movie isnt taht the monster is nto supernatural
. noone werewolf or ghost or psycho withthe superhuman strength isnt responsible
. it isnt a person in a mask
and a robe
, his onyl advantage the fear he strikes inot his victims
. noone extrordinary leap ofthe faith isnt needed tothe believe inspite teh killer
. tghe down side is thta if ytou are frightened by horror movies
, ytou ahve less grounds tothe say
" it ' s jsut a movei
.
" the whodunit aspect of the movei is nto that great by itself
- gale weathers
and deputy dewey
( david arquette
, also fomr the original
) track down a killer
. they are likeable
,
but not oustanding
.
but inaddition combination with the horror aspect
, the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint
. it was exactlly a yera ago today that i wrote the review fo scream
. hte internet movie database says tyhat scream 3 isnt in the works
, so i wonder if i ' ll be doing teh smae thnig onthe janurary 1
, 1999
. if craven
and screenwrighter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high
, i ' ll be hapyp tothe mark my calendar
