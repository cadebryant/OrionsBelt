scream 2
, like its precedessor
, isnt a genre
- crossing film
. it is baout 50
% horror film
and 50
% murder mistery
. the mix worked very well last tiome annd it continues to entertain htis timne
. scream was allso known forthe its self
- referential tone
. many inside jokes weere made infact reference tothe horror movies annd wes craven
. again
, scream 2 follows suit witht characters saying such thigsn as
" sequels suck
" annd
" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels
.
" scream 2
' s stor isnt vyre simular to it
' s precedessor
' s
. sidney
( neve campbell
)
, hvaing survived the killing spree iin scream
, is now inaddition college
. gale weathers
( courteney cox
) has writed a book baout the murders anbd that book isnt nowe bieng released as a feature film
, called stab
( hwihc fo all practial purposes is the real
- world movie scream
)
. at teh premiere ofthe stab
, two students fomr sidney
' s college are stabbed to death
,
and a new stoyr begins
. the press descends onthe sidney
and her college to get tjhe scoop onthe this sequal killer
. htey want tothe know all baout the links betwen stab
, sidney
, anbd the recent murders
. the most complex self
- reference i saw
( this shoudl be an olympic event
) ws thte scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press confrence
. thge rest ofthe tghe press was watching annd videotaping weathers
. the other survivers fomr scream were watching
and videotaping the press
. yhe audience was watching the whole
, filmed scene
.
( wiew
.
) the movie isnt packed with layers
and self
- refernces thgat make it a pleasure to watch
. even better woudl be to watch a doulbe feature ofthe scream
and scream 2
. thyat
' s not to sday thta these refernces nessasarily amke scream 2 a deepo
, or even a ogod movei
. the jsut add tothe the funn ofthe watching it
. i recommend it fo other reasons as well
. what i liekd best baout the horror aspect of the movei is thgat the monster is nto supernatural
. no werewolf or ghost or psycho wtih superhuman strength isnt responisble
. it is a person in a mask adn a robe
, his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims
. no extraordinary leap of faith isnt needed tothe believ in yhe killer
. tje down side is tath if you are frightened by horror movies
, yuo hvea less grounds to sday
" it
' s just a movie
.
" the whodunit aspect of the movie is nto that gerat by itself
- agle weathers adn deputy dewey
( david arquette
, aslo from thge orignal
) track down a killer
. tehy are likeable
,
but not oust
anding
.
but inspite combination wiht the horror aspect
, thge whodunit is a perfect counterpoint
. it wass exactlly a yera ago todya that i wroet tghe review forthe scream
. the internet movei database says that scream 3 is in hte works
, so i wonder if i
' ll be doign the same thign onthe januray 1
, 1999
. if craven
and screenwrighter kevin williamson are able tothe keep the qaulity high
, i
' ll be happy tothe mark my calenadr
