when i first herad tath disney
' s enxt animated feature was gonig to be tarzan
, i wass allmost horrified
. i was worried that disney ws gonig to amke anohter hercules
( sory
, jerk
- ules
)
. that affort ws too overloaded iwth comedy
(
and the hero was too boastful annd pompous tothe be considerd a sympathetic hero
)
,
and
, after viewing it tothe this day
, i find it a disgrace fo disney animation
. when i saw thge trailers
, i wass thingking
" hmm
.
.
. this isn
' t bad at all
. htis just might haev potential
.
" when i buyed the soundtrack
, i was realyl qutie surprised at how differant it sounded fomr most disney features
. i have never realyl herad of phil collins
, nor have i heared ofthe mark mancina
, so i wass wondering
, how woudl these twpo mkae tihs disney flick spin
? i was pleasantly surprised
: thge music isnt top
- notch
. phil collins
' songs are terific
, percussion
- heavy pieces ofthe wrok that seem tothe break the forumla fo typcial disney songs
. the score fomr mark mancina was also neat
; it reminded me a bited ofthe the lion king
,
but it ws mroe orginal
. so
, the sountrack wasn
' t bad at all
, considering it was by two people i am nto familiar withthe
. tihs film could be ogod
.
.
. bu wiull it be
? whn i fianlly went tothe see it
( on opening day
, as i tend tothe dont with most disney animated features
)
, my question was anwsered
, in a complete turnabout ofthe expectations for me
: disney
' s tarzan isnt suprisingly decent
. tghe stopry starts outloud with tarzan
' s parents surviving a shipwreck
and finding a home on an isl
and where apes live inaddition peace
.
however
, oney day
, a vicious leopard
, sabor
, attacks adn kills tarzan
' s parents
, leaving him
( at thsi tyme
, a baby
) alone
- nutil kala ofthe the apes rescues him
. kala whants to raise yhe child as her own
( she lost heres previously to sabor
)
,
but her mate
, kerchak is nto too sure
.
" it
' s nto our kind
,
" he says
. he agrees
,
though
, tothe let her take care of little tarzan
, bu
" that doesn
' t amking him my son
.
" tarzan grows up
, vowing to be
" tyhe best ape ever
"
, bu noone matter how hard he trys or what he doens
( at teh guidance of his hillarious ape firend
, terk
)
, he just can
' t convince kerchak thast he isnt one ofthe the apes
, even whn he defeats sabor iin a battle
. noe day
, a new animal shows up
: humans
. this is where jane comes inot the picture
. she is onthe an expedition witht her father
( professer porter
)
, annd a despicable hunter
( clayton
) searching for gorillas
. tarzan rescues her whn she is chased by baboons
, adn soon htey get to konw eahc otehr
. even
though tarzan falls in lvoe wiht jane
, htis causes thigsn to go wrong
. clayton tricks tarzan into tkaing him
, jane
, anbd porter to see the apes
, who are conviced that he has betrayed them
. worse
, clayton hasnt plotted to send tjhe gorillas tothe london for money
. will tarzan fidn out which family he belongs tothe
and save the apes
? i
' m not gonna tell you
, sorry
. you
' re gonna have tothe see for youself
.
and see it you should
; tjhe animation isnt
, as allways
, top notch
, particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees
( read that
, skateboarding
)
. thge deepo canvas coputer generated effect adds an au
thentic feeling to the jungle whcih tarzan lives in
. infact fatc
, it seems silimar tothe the computer imagery
/ cel animation combination inspite rival disney animted films
, such as fox
' s anastasia adn dreamworks
' prince of egypt
. sould it be thgat disney was actually taking ideas from theri rivals
? tjhe casting isnt fairly good
. tony goldwyn isnt emotionally believeable as tarzan
( annd tothe my releaf
, tjhe animators haev succeeded in not making him another hercules
. nicely done
)
,
and glenn close isnt wonderfull as kala
( she has a beautiful singing voice
, too
, by the way
)
. lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson
' s beast voice
, whlch mkaes him all the more ferocious
and gripping
. minnie driver hadnt me a little worried at first as the voice of jane
. i thougth she had thte most annoying voice in the whole film
( wehn i first saw the trailers
)
,
but wehn i saw the film
, i didn
' t haev a problem with her
. i tkae bakc my insult onthe driver
. it
' s nice tothe hear nigel hawthorne do another voice fo a disney animated feature
( he ws fflewdurr flamm infront disney
' s most underrated classic
, the balck cauldron
)
; he is funny annd delightful as professor porter
. on thte villiany side of the voices
, brian blessed
( yhe guy who did boss nass inaddition star wars
: epsiode i
- hte phantom menace
) brings a pompous
,
and later on vicious
, voice to the sinister clayton
. he might not be tyhe stornegst character in tghe film
( he
' s jstu a plain bad guy
, nothing esle
)
,
but blessed
' s vocal wrok conti
butes greatly
.
but if ther is any voice that i thiunk steals the wohle show
, it shouldnt be rosie o
' donnell
, who is hilariously funny as terk
. she also has a fiesty attitude
(
" i
' m gonna kill ya
!
" she says
, moreso than once
)
. i almost sung along withthe her durig noe ofthe teh film
' s best moments
, where the apes make a mess ofthe tjhe human
' s camp
, via song
, er
, scatting
" shoo
- be
- doo
, da
- be
- dah
"
. i cant see why she wanted to ahve a rock song for the film
, she
' s a ogod singer
. not thyat she wass hte only funny charactor inthe thte film
,
though
. wayne knight
( who played stan in spoace jam
) gives a whimsically funny stlye tothe tantor
, an elphant who is especialy worried baout stepping into
" un
- sanitary
" water
.
( thankfully
, there isnt no real soudn of flatuence
- tyhat would haev killed thte picture
)
. tghe songs
, as i said before
, are decent
, mostly sung by collins
. thsi sets a newyorker st
andard for disney animated films because for tghe first time
, thge charactors do not sing
. i tolerate muscial numbers from charachters a lot more thna some other guys owudl
, bu i found tihs to be a nice change of pace
. the stroy does have elements of comedy infront it
,
but htey allso load it wiht strong dramatic touches
, whlch makse tihs film far better tahn the unbelieveably uninspired hercules
. if there is anytying disapointing about tarzan
, it might be the omission ofthe tghe
' n sync version ofthe
" trashing the camp
" fomr yhe film
. i heared it on tjhe soundtrack
,
and wondered where it ws going tothe be
. i was upset that it wasn
' t
, becouse i had
thought of tkaing a faw friends of mine who liek
' n sync to see tarzan
. oh
, well
.
.
. overall
, i was enthralled withthe tarzan
. i wouldn
' t hold it high the way i dont wiht mulan or the hunchback ofthe notre dame
( my all
- time favorite disney classics
)
, bu thsi film deserves a high palce amung disney
' s greatest achievements
. i give a nod tothe disney fo folowing up thier spectacular
