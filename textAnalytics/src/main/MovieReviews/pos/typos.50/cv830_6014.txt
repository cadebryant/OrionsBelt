. inspite her directorial de
but
, bastard out of carolina
, based upon dorothy allison
' s largely autobiographical book onthe child abuse anbd poverty inaddition teh south
, huston displays impressive preficiency behind tjhe camera as well
. the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright
, nicknamed bone by one ofthe her uncles at birth
, inspite post
- world war ii south carolina
. thru voice
- over
( narration done by laura dern
)
, we find that she nearly didn
' t survive birth
, as her single mother anney
, played by jennifer jason leigh
, wass thrown thru the windshield durig an automobile accident
. that
' s jsut the beggining of her toubles
. bone is deemed illegimate on her birth certificate
, a social stigma hwihc her mother annd her larg poor famaly obsesses over for years to come
. anney meets
and weds lyle
, a kind man annd ogod stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister befor dieing in an automobile accident
. anney
' s brother earle
, played by michael rooker
, introduces her tothe glen
, palyed by ron eldard
, a co
- worker at the mill
. glen
, the balck sheeps ofthe a wealthy family
(
" when are you gonna amke your daddy proud
? i
' ll tell ytou when
- never
!
" he
' s told
) annd filled wtih bitterness
, courts anney annd eventually wins her
, dispite warnings ofthe a violent temper
. wehn anney miscarries with his much
- prized baby boy
, glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts
and begins to direct them at bone
, beating adn abusing her
, while tjhe love
- dependent anney tries tothe turn a blind eye adn justify his behaviour
. things turn fo tje worse when glen loses his job
and the family ofthe four sink inot impoverishment
. while set several decades ago
, tihs story remains completely relevatn infact todya
' s society
, where abused wives return tothe thier husb
ands
,
and abuse commitetd agaisnt children by one spouse isnt routinely overlooked by the otehr
. the real star ofthe this domestic drama is nto top
- billed jennifer jason leigh
,
but child actress jena malone
, who plays bone inthe a wrenching
and wholley impressive de
but performance
. her wokr isnt of award
- calibre
,
and inaddition htis age in which a preponderence ofthe superb child performers have emerged
( kirsten dunst
, tina majorino
, anna paquin
, natalie portman
, christina ricci
, elijah woud
)
, malone
' s performance st
ands up well
. leigh
' s performance inspite bastard out of carolina isnt fine
,
al
thought she
' s not really given much to do
,
and ron eldard work is very solid
, skillfully manouvering his charactor
' s moods in
and out ofthe explosive rage
. one can always sence that underneath his glen is a presure
- cooker ticking away
. of yhe supporting casted
, speshal note must be made ofthe tyhe criminally underated michael rooker
' s peformance
. there
' s a bit too much generic formulaism inthe the screenplay fo my taste
, ffrom tje varios characters spouting off country bumpkinisms
, tothe hte familiar sighth of a dried
- up uptight wise old granny
( plyed by grace zabriskie
) sitting on the porch rocking chair
, to impassioned soliloquies better suited forthe a stage performance
. still
, it cannnot be denied that anne meredith
' s screenplay countains a wallop ofthe emotional pwoer
. huston
' s direction ofthe tje film isnt sureh
anded
and impressive
, giving the film good pacing
and eliciting ogod performances fomr her casted
, prticularly the young malone
. her sequences ofthe child abuse are shooted iin a hard
- hiting emotional
, rether thna graphic
, manner
,
and are very effective
. huston
' s talent witht camera positioning isnt wonderful
, from a visually striking shooted done through a fan
, tothe an extended sequence inwhich the front seat of an automobile
. the film has the toned
- down fiel of a television production
; bastard outloud ofthe carolina wass origanaly composed adn cut for broadcast onthe thte tnt cable staion
, who ended uv declining tje film due tothe sentiments that scenes of abuse anbd rape in teh film weere too disturbingly realsitic forthe theri audeince
. prehaps soem sequences of the film may be unpleasant
, bu as a wohle bastard out ofthe carolina adds up to a powerfull viewer experinece worth seeing
.
