at frist glance
, threee kings looks tothe be jstu another war movie
, the 90s verzion ofthe all those favourite war movies witht names i cannnot remeber
. the 90s version
, it definitely isnt
, jsut anohter war movie
? nto infront your dreasm
! imagin pulp fiction approch to saveing private ryan
, that
 s three kings for you
. believe it or not
, it bears the cool ofthe the fromer
adn thge stark humane meaninng of the latter
. tjhe stopry brings us to the twilight ofthe tje gulf war
, withthe the allied troops victorious
. majpr archie gates
( clooney
) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post
- war looting spree
; tjhe millions inaddition gold bars secretly stowed awya by saddam infact a desolate village in the desert
. as thte rest ofthe the troops are celebrating theri victory
adn getting ready to be shipped hmeo
, htis
` wild bunch
 goes awol onthe an armed hum
- vee
( yhe vehicle ofthe choice of the us army
)
. they soon find outloud thta htey hve much resistence
, as htey git tangled witht thge local rebellion aganist saddam
 s forces
. frequentily switching their modes between looters
and robin hood
 s merry men
, htey become consciously attacked by their own morals
. as hte film beigns tothe roll
, it seemed to haev a rather
` light
 mood tothe it
.
` spacial
 effects such as whn gates describes to his men how a bullet cin kill simply paves thge way for a glight
- hearted funny acation movie
. threee kings isnt much smarter than thast
. as the conflict becomes omre
adn mroe complex
, the audience iwll be trapped iin a limbo
, trying to stay focussed onthe thgat ight
- mood
/ sereous
- mood that yhe film seem to protray
. i personaly found htis analogeous tothe tyhe smae feelings of the main characters involved in the film
; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed
and their pwn sence ofthe humanity
. this simpley made tjhe entire xeperience ofthe watching threee kings truley briliant
. action sequences are not shooted as your ood
- fashioned war films nor anytying liek steven spielberg
 s in
- your
- face war violence
. they are carefully built to generate tension with just teh right tight close
- ups
and pauses
, right befoer tjhe action starts
. not john woo forthe sure
bu omre ofthe sergio leone
 s spaghetti western style
( tons ofthe them starring clint eastwood
)
. great performances by clooney
adn wahlberg
bu hte brilliance have to lie inaddition thge conception of htis film
; the screenwriter
and thte director
. threee kings ranks among the best films of thge yearm
, well
, for me at least
. highly recommended
.
