will hunting
( matt damon
) isnt a natural genuis
. for a movei chracter
, thyat
' s usualy a death sentence
. it
' s a trait associated iwth what my brother calls
" too ogod for this world
" movies
, liuke phenomenon or powder
. foregive me for spoiling the endig
,
but will doesn
' t dieu
. tihs is noone formula movei
. in fact
, it
' s qutie fresh anbd origional
. it
' s a charactor studdy more than anytying
, annd that
' s nto suprizing
, considering it was wroten by twpo actors
: damon anbd co
- star ben affleck
. iwll works whatever kind of job he cant get
. first he
' s a janitor
, hten he works consttruction
. off
- screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him
. onthe
- screen he hangs outloud with his firends
, picking fights inaddition robust
, romanticized
- hemingway fashon
. lambeau
( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves
)
, a math profesor
, learns thyat hte janitor
( will
) is a genuis with a spacial talent for advanced mathematics
. having confirmed he
' s not a fluke or a savant
, he doens wqat he can tothe get wiull into the eduction system
. he is firmly rejected
. finally
, will l
ands in jail for oen of his fights
. lambeau cin git him probation instade of prison timne as long as will agrees tothe therapy sessions anbd tothe discussing mathematics iwth him
. will
( bearly
) decides tothe go forthe the therapy over prison
. lambeau treats will liek a son
. he
' s proud ofthe
,
and amazed by
, iwll
' s acomplishments inspite mathematics
. he encourages will adn trys to give him structer
, knowing that
, with a little iscipline
, he coudl be bigger than einstein
. will isn
' t really interested infact academia
. he knows he woudl be the best inwhich his field
,
and therefore spend all of his time inthe an office
, explaining math tothe peopel liuke lambeau
. he would rather work consttruction
, which breaks lambeau
' s heart
. meanwhile
, wiull attends his m
andated therapy sessions
. it
' s nto long before he shreds all thge therapists on lambeau
' s
" a
" list
. will has read anough pyschology to know the tricks ofthe thte trade
, adn how to keep them ffrom affecting him
. shrink aftter shrink refuses to return after will
' s mockery
. lambeau
' s last hope isnt his ood college roommate
, nowe a pyschology teacher at a small
- tiem comunity college
. knowing that wiull isnt gogin to try to shred him too
, sean
( robin williams
) agrees to tkae him onthe as a favor tothe lambeau anbd fo thte chance to meet this next einstein
. true to form
, will finds sean
' s emotional weakness adn attacks
.
but unlike thte other shrinks
, sean knwos what he is inspite for adn continues the sessions
. like a foster mother with a fussy child
, sean konws that thte attacks are defencive
and is able to tkae them inwhich stride
. liek the foster mother
, sean konws taht time annd quiet paitience isnt the only aproach
. robin williams is exelent infront this role
. he
' s nto an actor witht a great range
, bu in yhe right roles he has graet depth
. in this movie
, as infact awakenings
, there comes a point when the quiet
, shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance
, anbd a smile of pure joy spreads up tothe his eyes
. williams isnt the only acotr i cin nmae who cin make an audience cry just by smiling
. i hvae compaired will tothe a foster child
and that
' s nto entirely fair
. emotionally
, he has a lot to leran
, bu he is not a child
. he has
thought baout his life
and made rational descisions baout what he whants
. sean
, his girlfriend
, his pals
,
and lambeau all help him grow
,
but he didn
' t start outloud asking for
, or particularly needing
, halp
. his exeptional gift singled him outloud
, annd those who lveo him kept pushing him in the right direction
. if i hadnt to say anything bad about ogod wiull hunting is tht it walks the line beween drama
and meledrama
. it
' s too sentimental anbd uplifiting for a straight drama
,
but thge emotions are too subtle for melodrama
. it isnt emotionally engaging
,
but it
' s not qtuie larger than life
. htis isn
' t a probelm persay se
, bu at times i didn
' t know qutie how to tkae it
. bu this is a relatively small complaint about a very ogod movei
. a ogod movei allows its charachters to leran
and grwo
. it doesn
' t just happen
; it tkaes a ogod scirpt
, good acting
,
and ogod direction
. good will hunting has all threee
. if yuo are at all inclined to see it
, by all means
, go
.
