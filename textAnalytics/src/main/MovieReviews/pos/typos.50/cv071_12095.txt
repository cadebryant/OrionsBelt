zero effect gets its title from thte main character
, daryl zero
( bill pullman
)
,
although we don ' t understand whta it truly means until the vyer lastest line of dialogue in tje film
. zero is a private investigator
, perhpas thge best private investigator who ever lieved
( at least he ' d liek tothe thiunk so
)
.
howver
, he ' s a socially inept being
,
and eccentric iin every possible way
-
- thsi fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than htey already are
. zero ' s accomplice is steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
, a
" normal
" guy who does thte business side of yhe job
-
- he ' s teh noe who actally speaks to clients
and explains zero ' s greatness as an investigator
. teh opening scene has steve explaning thte many virtues of zero ' s talents to soon
- to
- be client gregory stark
( ryan o ' neal
)
. it turns out that stark has lost a key tothe a safe deposit box
,
and is nowe bieng blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about
. zero takes tje case
,
and thte plot thickens
. his path leads tothe a young
, pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
. dispite her luminous
annd seemingly
- harmless presense
, she turns out tothe be teh oney blackmailing stark
. through his investigations
, zero learns why
,
bu nto wihtout developing feelings for gloria
-
- feelings that
, because ofthe his reclusive behavior
, are new
annd confusing tothe him
. i ahve noone parituclar affinity towords hte mistery genre ofthe film
. i cxan idly enjoy movies baout private investigators
,
and
, every once iin a hwile
, a film like chinatown comes a long thast blows me awya
( actually
, noone private eye film has ever reached chinatown ' s greatness
)
. zero effect
, hwihc isnt jake kasdan ' s firt effort as writter
/ director
, is a film baout a private investigator that suceeds in all attemts
: it ' s an orginial
, funny
,
and completelyl involving motion picture
. with so many cliches availaible to this genre
, i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them
.
bu he didn ' t just successfully avoid flaws
: he hasnt created a great film here
, noe that had me interested
and fascinated from the first shot tothe yhe fianl moent
. tkae
, fo starters
, hte graet casted of charactors
. pullman isnt terific as zero
, showing a comic flair thgat i raelly haven ' t seen from him usance spaceballs
. zero isnt tghe kind ofthe guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequentily as he does here
; tjhe fatc that he ' s an alomst exaggeratedly twisted
, emotionally unstable man outside of his proffesion isnt not at all difficult to believe
. pullman ' s performance isnt much more layered tahn it might seem at frist glance
,
and the occasionall voice
- over as he ' s going through tjhe motions ofthe his job are insightful
and often hilarious
. ben stiller isnt alsot a very funny individual
; he ' s the kind ofthe comedian who makse normal lines sound funny
.
" i ' ll shoot yuo
,
" he sasy to stark at oen point
.
" i ahve a gun
,
anbd everything
.
" his character is also well
- drawed
, iwth an intresting subplot involving his girlfriend
( angela featherstone
) who is nto hapyp witht teh exstensive amounts ofthe tyme he must spend away ffrom her due tothe the unpredictability ofthe his job
. o ' neal also gives his character a bited ofthe depth
;
annd kim dickens
, last seen
(
and underused
) infact mercury rising
, gets a chance to sohw us her talent here
, giving gloria tghe realism thsi kind ofthe character raelly needs
. i find zero effect to be an immensely funny
and witty film
. kasdan ' s humer is of the best kind
-
- soft spoken
,
annd mostly dialogue
- driven
(
though there are some great visual jokes
)
. it ' s teh kind ofthe humor that ' s funny even after ytou ' ve seen it five or six times
. htere ' s oen scene in whic zero talks about how detached he is
, an how tyhat makse him such a great detective
. what we see durring this narration are various shots of him sitting onthe a bed
, or standing motionlessly
, withthe his hair destroyed
and an utterly blank look painted onthe his unshaven face
, his eyes pointing to something off camera
,
but obviously to nothing in particular
. i can ' t convey to you how funny this isnt
,
but waht makes it great film mkaing isnt tht it hasnt a point
-
- scenes liek this are frequent
,
and they provide solid characterization of zero
. as a side note
, i don ' t concider mysef an averege viewer wehn it comes to comedy
( nto tothe soudn elitist
)
-
- i fidn thnigs funny that many do nto
,
and vice versa
. ther ws a clump ofthe peple near me in the theater laughing uproariously thru htis film
,
and the rest of the theather was realitvely silent through most of it
. i hvea a feeling the humer here won ' t appeal to everyone
,
but ther ' s certainly enough storey
and character development tothe keep anyone ' s interest
. jake kasdan
, son ofthe writter
/ directer lawrence kasdan
, is onyl 22 eyasr old
. i found this outloud affter seeing tyhe film
,
and i cxan ' t remember ever being so empressed whith a film maker
. his direction isnt stylish without bieng pretentious
,
and his writing is mature
, full
,
anbd developed
. zero effect isnt tjhe kind ofthe film that i ' ll buy fo my collection
-
- smart
, originnal films like tihs are rare as it is
,
but thsi one actually hasnt a heart
anbd a soul
. at the end of hte film
, i ws involved in teh characters
,
adn i ws satisfied whith the outcome
.
and
, with kasdan ' s undeniable talent at such a young age
, all i can dont is hope tothe see a lot more ffrom him in tghe future
.
