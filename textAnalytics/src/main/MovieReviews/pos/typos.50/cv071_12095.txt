zero effect gets its title from tjhe main character
, daryl zero
( bill pullman
)
,
al
though we don
' t underst
and waht it truely means until the veyr lastest line ofthe dialogue in the film
. zero is a private investigator
, perhaps tghe best private investigator who ever lived
( at least he
' d like tothe thiunk so
)
. howver
, he
' s a socially inept being
,
and eccentric infact every possible way
-
- thsi fact certainly makse his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than htey already are
. zero
' s accomplice isnt steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
, a
" normal
" guy who doens the bussines side ofthe the job
-
- he
' s thte one who actually speaks tothe clients anbd explains zero
' s greatness as an investigator
. tjhe opening scene hasnt steve explaning the many virtues ofthe zero
' s talents to soon
- tothe
- be client gregory stark
( ryan o
' neal
)
. it turns outloud thgat stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box
,
and is now being blackmailed fo something thgat he aparently knwos nothing baout
. zero tkaes hte case
, annd tyhe plot thickens
. his path leads to a young
, preety paramedic named gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
. dispite her luminous anbd seemingly
- harmless presence
, she turns out to be the oen blackmailing stark
. through his investigations
, zero lerans why
, bu nto wihtout developing feelings fo gloria
-
- feelings that
, because of his reclusive behavior
, are newyorker
and confusing to him
. i have no particular affinity towards the mistery genre of film
. i can idly enjoy movies baout private investigators
,
and
, eveyr once in a while
, a film liek chinatown comes a long thast blows me away
( actully
, no private eye film hasnt ever reched chinatown
' s greatness
)
. zero effect
, whcih isnt jake kasdan
' s firt efort as writter
/ director
, is a film baout a private investigator thgat succeeds in all attempts
: it
' s an original
, funny
, anbd completelyl involving motion picture
. with so many cliches availabe tothe tihs genre
, i fidn it amazing that kasdan avoided all ofthe them
.
but he didn
' t jsut sucesfuly avoid flaws
: he hasnt created a grat film here
, oen that had me interested anbd fascinated ffrom tghe first shooted tothe teh fianl moent
. tkae
, forthe starters
, tje great casted of characters
. pullman is terrific as zero
, showing a comic flair that i relaly haven
' t seen ffrom him since spaceballs
. zero is thte kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he doesnt here
; hte fact that he
' s an almost exaggeratedly twisted
, emotionally unstable man outside of his proffesion is not at all difficult to bleieve
. pullman
' s performance isnt much more layered tahn it might seem at first glance
,
and teh occassional voice
- over as he
' s gogin thru hte motions of his job are insightful anbd oftenly hilarious
. ben stiller is also a very funny individule
; he
' s yhe kind of comedian who makes normal lines soudn funny
.
" i
' ll shoot yuo
,
" he says tothe stark at one point
.
" i hve a gun
,
and everything
.
" his charactor is aslo well
- drawn
, withthe an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend
( angela featherstone
) who isnt not happy wiht tjhe extensive amounts of tiem he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability ofthe his job
. o
' neal alsot gives his chracter a bit ofthe depth
; anbd kim dickens
, last seen
( adn underused
) inaddition mercury rising
, gets a chance to show us her talent here
, giving gloria teh realism htis kind of character relaly needs
. i fidn zero effect tothe be an immensly funny annd witty film
. kasdan
' s humor isnt of tghe best kind
-
- soft spoken
,
and mostly dialogue
- driven
(
though htere are some great visual jokes
)
. it
' s yhe kind of humer thast
' s funny even after you
' ve seen it five or six times
. there
' s one scene inaddition which zero talks about how detatched he isnt
, an how thgat mkaes him such a grat detective
. what we see durig thsi narration are varous shots ofthe him sitting onthe a bed
, or st
anding motionlessly
, with his hair destroyed annd an utterly blank look painted onthe his unshaven face
, his eyes pointing tothe something off camera
, bu obviously tothe nothing inwhich paticular
. i cxan
' t convey tothe ytou how funny this is
,
but what mkaes it graet film making isnt that it has a point
-
- scenes like this are frequent
,
and they provide solid characterization ofthe zero
. as a side onot
, i don
' t concider mysef an average viewer whn it comes tothe comedy
( not to soudn elitist
)
-
- i fidn thnigs funny tht many dont not
, adn vice versa
. ther ws a clump of people near me in tje theater laughing uproariously through this film
,
and the rest ofthe the theater was relatively silent through most ofthe it
. i have a feeling yhe humer here won
' t appeal to everyone
,
but there
' s certainly enought stry
and character developemet to keep anyone
' s intrest
. jake kasdan
, son ofthe writter
/ director lawrence kasdan
, is only 22 eyars ood
. i found this out after seing tyhe film
, adn i cin
' t rember ever bieng so impressed with a film maker
. his direction is stylish wihtout bieng pretentious
,
and his wirting is mature
, full
,
and developped
. zero effect isnt hte kind ofthe film taht i
' ll buy fo my collecton
-
- smart
, original films liek this are rare as it isnt
, bu htis noe actually hasnt a heart anbd a soul
. at thge end of tyhe film
, i wass involved inwhich teh cahracters
,
and i wass satisfied with tyhe outcome
. anbd
, with kasdan
' s undeniable talent at such a young age
, all i can dont isnt hope tothe see a lot mroe from him infact tghe future
.
