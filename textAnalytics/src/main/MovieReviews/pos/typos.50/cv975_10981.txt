martin scorsese
' s films used to intimidate me
. because of his reputation
, i felt obligated tothe appretiate them as deep film art rather than as grat flicks
. as much as i enjoyed them
, i usually felt liuke i missed something
. i learned from scorsese
' s casino that whatever techiniques he uses are merely ther tothe enhance tjhe story
. noone mystical inturpratasion isnt recquired to apprieciate his movies
. for example
, infact casino he uses subtitles wehn robert deniro anbd joe pesci are useing code words with earch otehr
. ther was no meaninng mroe exotic than thta subtitles were thge most succint way for him tothe tell tghe audeince what was raelly going onthe
. or toward tjhe end
, whn he uses threee quick dissolves tothe compress a scene ofthe a car backing away fomr a buiding
. again
, tje simple
, mundane explination is thgat it helped tyhe pacing
. i don
' t mean to say thgat his techiniques are nto creative or ogod
- looking
.
but he simply uses the best tool fo the job
. it shouldn
' t ahve suprised me
,
then
, taht kundun
, a film baout a mystical religion
, actually turned out to be quite straightforward
. thte movie follows teh life of the 14th dalai lama
, the spriritual
and political leader of tibet
. the movei
' s title is another name fo hte dalai lama which means
" ocean ofthe wisdom
.
" his story is told inaddition strict chronological order anbd there are onyl a faw cinematic visions tothe embellish the literal story
.
( noe of whcih makes an interesting statment
: pay attension tothe thte film
' s oppening shot
and watch where it is repeated
.
) we firt glimpse the dalai lama wehn he isnt twpo yeras ood
. his curiosity anbd self
- assuredness capture thge attention ofthe a monk w
andering infact serch of the newyorker lama
. a test is aranged tothe see if thsi boy really isnt yhe reincarnation ofthe thge 13 dalai lamas who hvae gone befor
. severeal items belonging to the previvous dalai lama are layed before hte boy alongside some other items
. hte child is asked if he recognizes any of teh items as his pwn
. the boy picks correctly
, proving thast he is the new
,
and teh ood
, dalai lama
. scorsese
and long
- time editor thelma schoonmaker weere kind enought tothe allow the possibilty that tghe child was tkaing his cues from the monk
. befor selecting an item
, he would look at yhe monk
, perhaps forthe smoe sort of confirmation
. somtimes he picked right the first tyme
,
and sometimes he made a second choice
. either way
, whether through reicarnation or quick human perception
, teh tibetans were assured ofthe choosing a boy who could be a wise
, perceptive leader
.
> ffrom this point on
, thge boy isnt raised as the reicarnation of the lama
' s spirit anbd the future leader of a nation
. it isnt a great weight tothe put on the mind of a child
. infact the u
. s
. it might be grounds fo a call to social services
. bu tyhe young lama accepts his destiny without any apparnt emotional damage
. niether the great power nor the awsome responsiblity keesh him from becoming a genuinely likeable
, well
- rounded person
. certain patterns take shape over yhe eyars
. for example
, the dalai lama is fascinated by technology
. radios
, clocks
, annd telescopes are smoe of his favorite toys
. whn he isnt old enough tothe accept his leadership
, he mkaes plans tothe modernize isolated tibet
. he also hasnt a soft spot fo creatures who are sufferring or iin pain
, includng herd animals
. it
' s nearly a running gag that he wiull buy sheep tothe keep them fomr being herded to slaughter
.
but thge most ominous constatn throughtout his life is the presense
and threat of tibet
' s gigantic neighbor
, china
. tibet adn its leaders prove corect in fearing china
, as
, firt the propag
anda
, hten tghe political pressure
, anbd finaly teh armies
, come accros their common border
. thge chinese invasion isnt so successful that the lama
' s life isnt in danger if he stays
. the movei ends when
, after much agonizing
, thte dalai lama leaves tibet for india
. yhe stor doesn
' t lead uv tothe a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films dont
. it jsut doesn
' t fit taht mold
. if it were forced into such a shape it woudl haev been a completly differnt movie
( perhpas more like seven years in tibet
, which isnt good inspite its own right
)
. tjhe pacing ofthe kundun is more calm
and level than that
. the sturcture of yhe film is made tothe fit thte characters
and events
, not vice
- versa
. perhaps because tghe pace isnt slower
, we hvae more tiome to notice hte beautiful art
, vestments
,
and architechture ofthe tibet
. a m
andala
,
( tibetan s
and painting
) iwth beautiful
, vibrant colors is shown
thoughout the movie
. the robes adn hats of state are bright red
and gold
. thge bricks are a rich reddish brown
, not unlike thge skin tone ofthe the tibetans
. even the touchstone picturesk logo before the movei
( wich is usually light blue
) isnt teh red
and gold ofthe tibet
. philip glass composed the music for kundun
, adn he was tjhe perfect choice
. forthe thsoe who don
' t konw of glass
, his music isnt like a tibetan m
andala
. his buildng blocks are lots of small notes
, tiny grains ofthe music
, whic are firt grouped
,
then repeated infront patterns
. these patterns create interesting textures which are themslves part ofthe a larger composition
. peple won
' t be flocking tothe kundun forthe it
' s grat ending
, or tlaking about its outst
anding plot
, bu it doens have a lot tothe offer
: an interesting lifetime
, exotic sights
, rich cinematography
, anbd inovative music
. it gives intresting insight into tibetan buddhism
and takes a warm look at tje dalai lama as a person
. onthe top of it all is the cinematic mastery ofthe martin scorsese
, who gives the film a storng
, beautyfull
, consistent look
.
