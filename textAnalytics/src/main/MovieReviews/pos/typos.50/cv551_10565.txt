" tje cyborsuit isnt actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins
and jettisoned forthe latter retrieval when tehy are under attack ffrom the invading broodwarriors
. the significant twist in the story isnt taht spencer gets to go inside hte cyborsuit
, annd the cyborsuit
, nicknamed cy
, has plenty ofthe spunk
. cy keeps questioning tyhe kid about everyting including words like
" cool
.
" upon hearing thast

" thsi whole setup fo spencer
' s downtrodden anbd delightfully funny life mkaes his aquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth
and empowerment

,
but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer
and directer manny coto so that one never fiels embarrased tothe be laughing

, didn
' t ytou
? cy cannot allow spencer tothe leave the cyborsuit
, anbd what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet
and hillarious
. tjhe director
' s staging ofthe htis sequence isnt oney of teh film

, annd eating isnt pretty funny too

, whose idol is tyhe comic book character
" midknight warrior
,
" gets tothe face tyhe challege ofthe a liftime wehn a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit
. spencer
' s valient battle gives him a chance to fidn his mettle
.
and teh action sequences infront tjhe battle manage tothe be quite respectable for a kids
' show full of inventiveness
and lacking the usual reptition
. fo a family movie mixing humor
, fantasy
, adn action
, star kid delivers
.
al
thought it
' s probably not hte sort ofthe movie yuo
' d whant tothe see without kids

' ll ahve a magical tiem witht a relatively straightforward bu well developped story
. you
' ll be rooting forthe
and laughing with spencer
and his buddy cy all tyhe way thru
. star kid runs 1
: 41
. it is rated pg fo fantasy combat
. all
though the basicaly cartoonish broodwarrior might scare thge littlest kids
, i saw none of htis in evidence iin our packed screening
, so i woudl sday the show isnt fine for kids five anbd uv
, annd possibly tyhe yuonger ones
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, got really excisted baout hte picture
. he called it
" an expecially good movie
" anbd gave it
