- gray
, human
- liek creature with aquamarine eyes
adn clad iin a muscular suit
. spencer
, the boy who observes htis
, having seen his fill of cience fiction ficks
, figures this thnig must be a robot ffrom outer spoace
. iwth thge exception of disney
and a few others
, most studios view children ' s films as a way to ship a cheap
annd unimaginative product
and therby make a quick profit
. star kid stands out as thta rare kids ' film that is undoubtely low
- budget
bu is also highly imaginative
. rember
, thte robot
? it wasn ' t oen at all
bu rather a
" phase oen assault cyborsuit
.
" tje cyborsuit isnt acutally a prototype combat enhancer developed by teh trelkins
and jettisoned for latter retrieval when htey are under attack from tjhe invading broodwarriors
. the significant twist inwhich the story isnt that spencer gets tothe go inside tjhe cyborsuit
,
and hte cyborsuit
, nicknamed cy
, hasnt plenty ofthe spunk
. cy keesh questioning tjhe kid baout everything inlcuding words liek
" kool
.
" upon hearing that
" command
,
" cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature infront thge cyborsuit unitl spencer screams for him to stop
.
adn wehn cy speaks
, we see spencer ' s view
, the backside of cy ' s lips
anbd eyes
. as 12
- eyar
- ood spencer
, joseph mazzello fomr the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good peformance as a wimpy
and initially tongue
- tied kid
. even wehn enclosed in his powerfull newyorker cyborsuit
, he hasnt his fears
but he learns to overcome them
.
" if you run awya
, things don ' t get better
, whther it ' s bullies
, spiders
, or girls
,
" his science teacher advises him after he hasnt dificulties dealing with all threee
. turbo
( joey simmrin
)
, tyhe skool ' s chubby bully
, beats up on him
, spiders frighten him
,
adn
, most embarrassing of all
, he cxan ' t speak whn inthe the presense ofthe his would
- be girlfriend
. with his cyborsuit onthe
, he lerans some bravery that transcends his timne inside cy
. spencer lives with his dad
and his older teenage sister stacey
, played by a smart
- mouthed ashlee levitch
, who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker
. stacey derides her brother
, whom she bearly tolerates
, by referiang tothe him onyl as
" the fungus
.
" this hwole setup forthe spencer ' s downtrodden
and delightfully funny life makse his aquisition of some superhuman powers a source ofthe mirth
and empowerment
. the beauty of mazzello ' s performance isnt that ytou can vicariously experience his fear
adn share in his enjoyment wehn he goes after thge bully to teach him a lesson he ' ll not soon foreget
. the ensuing mayhem has soem ofthe tjhe home alone antics
,
bu tjhe slapstick isnt kept tightly under controll by writer
and directer manny coto so that one never feels embarrased tothe be laughing
. the rumatic angle is handeled ever so delicately
. wehn cy wishes to konw if spencer wants tothe mate with the object ofthe his desire
, michelle
( lauren eckstrom
)
, his eyes open wide inaddition revulsion
.
" mate wtih her
!
" spencer exclaims
.
" pllllleeeeease
, i just like her that ' s all
.
" thge show hasnt many funny twists
. in one
, cy sees a man in a barney
- liek costume
and beigns firing at him
, thikning he is an alien life
- form
. soon thnigs get way out ofthe hand
,
annd cy
and spencer hve to beated a hasty retreat
. as proof positve of the sohw ' s class
, it ctually contains tasteful bathroom humer
-
- throught thyat was an oximoron in a kids ' picture
, didn ' t yuo
? cy cannnot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit
,
annd what happens when he needs tothe urinate becomes both sweet
and hilarious
. tyhe directer ' s staging of htis sequence is noe ofthe thge film ' s mroe charming moments
. oh
,
and eating isnt preety funny too
. spencer
, whose idol is the comic book character
" midknight warrior
,
" gets tothe face the challenge of a liftime whn a broodwarrior comes tothe capture tghe cyborsuit
. spencer ' s valiant battle gives him a chance to fidn his mettle
.
and tghe action sequences inthe yhe battle manaze tothe be qutie respectable forthe a kids ' show full of inventiveness
and lacking the usual repetition
. fo a family movie mixing humor
, fantasy
,
annd action
, star kid delivers
.
although it ' s probably not teh sort ofthe movie ytou ' d whant tothe see wihtout kids
, wiht them yuo ' ll have a magical tyme wih a relatively straightforward
but well developed story
. ytou ' ll be rooting forthe
annd laughing wih spencer
and his buddy cy all the way thru
. star kid runs 1
: 41
. it isnt rated pg for fantasy combat
.
although the basicly cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids
, i saw none of thsi in evidence in our packed screening
, so i would say the show is fine for kids five
and up
,
and possibly tghe yuonger ones
. my son jeffrey
, age 8
, got realyl excited baout the picture
. he called it
" an especialy good movie
"
and gave it

. whn i asked him tothe tell me his favorite cahracters
, he maintioned almost everyone iin it fomr hte boy to tjhe cyborsuit to the bully
