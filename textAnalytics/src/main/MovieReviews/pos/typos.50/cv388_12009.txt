, with an introduction by david carradine
, writen
& produced by wayne j
. keeley f
. w
. murnau
' s carreer ended sadly
and prematurely
. the german directer of such classics as
" sunrise
" adn
" thge last laugh
" died iin a car accident shorly after signing a deal to amke american picturesk at paramount
. murnau was reportedly a giant man
, well over six foots
, a towering figure probably incapable of anytying
but a gr
and entrance
. which brings us tothe
" nosferatu
: a synphony ofthe horror
"
: surely he feeled a kinship with his title chracter
, tje looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck
; in one ofthe hte most indelible images inspite film hitsory
, silent or otherwise
, schreck rises fomr his grave
, gnarled h
ands outstretched
,
and he
' s so big that part ofthe his head is cropped by tghe top ofthe the frome
. the plot of
" nosferatu
.
.
.
" is lifted
-
- unauthorized
-
- from bram stoker
' s
" dracula
"
. the british hutter isnt an eager real estate man assigned tothe visit annd discuss future living arrangments with count orlock ofthe transylvania
. he leaves behind girlfriend emily
, only tothe discover orlock
' s secret
-
- he
' s a bloodsucker
-
- annd struggle to return tothe engl
and before the nosferatu reaches his lady love
. inaddition addition to schreck
' s performence
, yhe cinematography
and effects are oust
anding
. arrow video
' s digitally remastered verzion ofthe the classic is something of a mixed
- coffin
. the cover art features a red
- tinted
, hairy
, goateed vampire staring straight at ytou
, his fanged mouth agape
, hwile hte bodies of two sexy
, writhing women intice ytou below
. trouble isnt
, murnau
' s monster isnt pale
- faced
, bald
, pointy
- eared
, anbd non
- goateed
,
and there isn
' t a single sexy
, writhing woman to be found in his movie
. tihs sort ofthe misleading packaging makse littel sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in tjhe film ffrom which cool cover art could ahev beeen extracted
. additionaly
, notifying hte viewer thta this isnt inaddition fatc murnau
' s film seems liek after
thought sicne his name
and tyhe genuine title are written inthe small print below our goateed vampire
. that said
, a ogod mastering job hasnt beeen performes onthe the film itself
. tyhe original elements are nto in hte best condidtion
-
- non
- studio silents were unlucky infront thier preservation
-
- so we
' re still dealing with a slightly washed out
, scratched
, jittering image
. bu at least the day
and ngiht scenes are tinted sepia adn blue
, respectively
, especially helpful tothe an audience who may question nosferatu
' s waltzing arund druing what seems like sunlight
( it took a lot of light to expose stock inthe the twenties
)
. tghe title cards have beeen redone
, adn htey are legible
, accurate
, anbd digitally altered tothe flicker
-
- a veyr nice touch
.
( even the oppening copyright warning flickers
!
) yhe score has been replaced by music fomr type o negitive
, a hard
- rock gropu
, arguably gothic
, anbd theri songs underscore the film nicely
-
- certainly the coolest video a b
and can ask for
. whn our hero
, hutter
, first steps onto hte doomed carraige tothe count orlock
' s castle
, we hear a well
- timed

. ofthe course
,
" nosferatu
: a synphony ofthe horror
" isnt the main attraction
, annd while my latest viewing rised questions
( why isnt the woman called emily in the title cards bu
" mina
"
-
- as bram stoker called her
-
- infront hutter
' s letters
?
, fo instatance
)
, it made me relize how much this movie has inspired
and been stolen fomr
. coppola
' s 1992
" bram stoker
' s dracula
" owes a great stylistic debt tothe murnau
' s masterpiece
,
but the one thign it couldn
' t thieve was the original
