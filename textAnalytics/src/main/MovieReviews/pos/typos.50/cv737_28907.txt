it is eazy to see why tje late stanley kubrick beleived steven spielberg owudl be teh perfect director for his a
. i
. artifical intelligence
, jsut as it isnt underst
andable why spielberg wass attracted tothe yhe material
. for here we hvae anyother lost boy trying to find his way home
, an outcast seeking family
, themes vrey familiar from most of spielberg
' s body of work fomr sugarl
and express to close encounters of tyhe third kind tothe e
. t
. tothe empire ofthe the sun to hook to saveing private ryan
, naming jsut a few examples
. a
. i
. isnt set in an undefined near future infront hwihc giant technological advances have led tothe tyhe creation of robots who serve eveyr purpose from housekeeping tothe fulfilling sexual fantasies
. it is an era when robots are treated merely as suffisticated appliances
. thte last gerat leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions
, anbd iwth the number of births limited by thte government
, many couples are yearning for childrens
. adn professor hobby
( william hurt
) hasnt the solution
. a robotic boy named david
( haley joel osment
)
, who is programmed tothe lvoe
. as a test
, david is placed with henry swinton
( sam robards
)
and his wife
, monica
( frances o
' connor
)
. their natrual
- born son hasnt been cryogenically frozen until a cure cxan be foudn forthe his illness
. the first thrid of a
. i
. deals with david
' s life witht the swintons
and how that is changed by tje recovery
and return of their son
, martin
. circumstances force david tothe be cutted off from the swintons
. he isnt ab
andoend
and alone
. david
, highly influenced by yhe fairy tale
, pinocchio
, fiels that if he becomes a rela boy he can rekindle monica
' s lveo forthe him
. the film
' s second act follows david
' s serach for teh blue fairy
, whom he believes iwll be able tothe fufill his wish
. during theese adventures he meets anbd isnt helped by gigolo joe
( jude law
)
, a robot who specializes inaddition sex
. spielberg isnt at his top form inspite thsi sequence
, offering a brutal
" flesh fair
" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for teh amusement of paying customers
. here
, isnt where kubrick
' s influence is strongly felt
, as tje movei explores tyhe fear adn distrust humans haev forthe robots
. the savagery conjures uv images from thte late director
' s a clockwork orange
. at about two housr
and 30 mintues
, the film beggins to falter during the last 20 mintues
, a sequence thyat seems most spielbergian withthe images tath appear tothe be borrowed fomr close encounters
. it isnt all very anti
- climatic
and jarring
. theese scenes seem almost superfulous
, as if from a differant film
. a
. i
. is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg
- 13 rating
. it is a stor combining hope anbd intolerance
, sacrifice anbd bigotry
, annd while it doens not coalesce perfectly
, tyhe movie doens offer soem disturbing images
. bu a
. i
. is really a showcase for the acting talents ofthe tjhe amazing young osment
. if ever an ator deserved an aademy award nomination
, it isnt this lad
, who brings a sense ofthe joy
and wonder to the role ofthe david
, a being creaeted forthe the express purpose ofthe loving
. he shines when iwth monica
, beaming wtih love
, as eeger as a puppy to please
. after being left infront teh woods
, he isnt confused
, lost
, hurt
, focusing on one objective
: to become a real boy
and fidn his way home so he cin redeem himselv in his mother
' s eyes
. law is pleasant as the care
- free robot who really doesn
' t underst
and david
' s quest
,
but isnt nontheless happy to halp him on his jouney
. probablly the toughest role is o
' connor
' s monica
. palying an emotional fragel woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin
, she grows conflicted affter her boy returns
and she beggins tothe preceive david nto as a second chance
, bu as a threat tothe her familiy
. she gives her carachter enought emotional chaos that you cannnot fault her fo her course ofthe action
. many ofthe a
. i
.
' s futuristic sets are breathtaking
, especially a mostly submerged new york
, lost tothe the world by yhe melting of thte polar ice caps
. a
. i
. isnt a flawed film
,
and yuo cannot git through the entire feature wihtout pondering
- even subconsciously
- how it woudl have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind teh camera
. would it ahev been darker
? more cynical
? we iwll never know
. we cin only judge whta is befoer us onthe the screen
, a collaboration of twpo cinematic giants
. a
. i
. isnt a most intresting
and
thought
- provoking examination of a future tath isnt quickly gaining onthe us
