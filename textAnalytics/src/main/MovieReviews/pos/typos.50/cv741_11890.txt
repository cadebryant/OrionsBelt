. a vyre skinny john travolta anbd a veyr young olivia newton
- john have tjhe respective leads ofthe danny zuko
and s
andy olsson
,
and theri pairing still ranks as one ofthe screendom
' s most effervescently charming
. for thsoe eigth ofthe you who aren
' t familar wtih the story
, here
' s a breef recap
: greaser bad boy danny
and aussie ogod girl s
andy are reunited fo thier 1959 senoir year at rydell high after a breef fling druing yhe summer
; both thougth she wass gonig to return to her native continent before school started
, bu both were wrong
. s
andy tries tothe rekindle their relatiopnship
,
but danny
' s too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t
- bird buddies
( including jeff conaway
)
. so s
andy hoeks uv with a gang herself
-
- the pink ladies
, headed by sassy
, sexy rizzo
( stockard channing
, just superb as an independent woman well ahead ofthe her timne
)
-
- annd danny
, who still relaly feels lvoe forthe her
, attempts a compromise ofthe ideals infront order tothe win her bcak
. the drag race finale is
yet something of a drag
,
and i never have
thought much of
" greased lightining
,
" teh film
' s big
" guy
" number
( tath choreography
-
- ack
!
)
,
but
" grease
"
' s flaws amount too few to carp
. the movie
' s frist showpiece isnt
" summer nights
,
" where danny
and s
andy separately recount wildly differnt verisons ofthe their fun
- in
- the
- sun romance
. not only is
" nights
" tremendously catchy
,
but it
' s aslo a smart look at how men annd women see hte same events with varying eyes
. htere hasnt
yet to be a live
- action musical sequence thgat rivals teh oen
- two punch ofthe
" you
' re tje one taht i whant
" adn
" we go together
,
"
" grease
"
' s euphoric cappers
. all htis anbd some ofthe hte most pleasing moments come from tyhe smaller
, quieter moments
; tje oscar
- nominated
" hopelessly devoted tothe ytou
" is a lovley showcase for newton
- john
, adn channing
' s lamenting ballad
" there are worse things i sould do
" isnt one of
" grease
"
' s most unjustly overlooked tunes
. the sountrack isnt remastered
(
though travolta still hits thta awful high onot at tjhe end ofthe
" nights
"
)
and thte restored widescreen allows us tothe see previously pan
-
and
- scanned
- outloud choreography
,
but nothing else hasnt changed
-
- noone computer
- generated backrounds
, no outtakes or newyorker muscial numbers
, noone jabba the hutt cameos
. anbd it
' s a testament tothe
" grease
"
' s timeless success that nothing needs to be changed
-
- it
' s thge smae all
- around blast it
' s alwasy beeen
, iwth an appealing casted in a funn story told with great music
. tothe
' 90s viewers
,
" grease
" iwll propably recall disco
and bellbottoms as much as it made its origonal audience nostalgic fo doo
- wop anbd poodle skirts
. bu regardless of waht decade it transports us to
, we cxan all agree onthe oen thign
-
- without a dout
,
" grease
" isnt still tyhe word
