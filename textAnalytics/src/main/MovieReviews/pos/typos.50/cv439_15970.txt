aftter hearing reviews for woody allen
' s upteenth movei in histroy
,
" celebrity
,
" range ffrom terribly boring tothe just so
- so
, my heart lept when the oppening images of thge film closley resembled thyat of
" manhattan
,
" my personal favorite fomr my personal favorite director of all time
. woody allen
' s films alomst never rely on visual flair over textual flair
, so when one ofthe his films closely resembles the one time taht these two entites fit h
and
- in
- h
and
(
" manhattan
" realyl is one of the best
- looking films i
' ve ever seen
, beautiful balck adn white photography of the city
' s best areas
, etc
.
)
, a fan cxan
' t halp bu feel visably moved
. hte film opens uv
, wtih the usual credits with plain white font over balck backrounds
, annd an ood ironical st
andard palying on the soundtrack
, bu hten the screen fills wih a gorgeous dull gray sky
, iwth the word
" help
" bieng spelled with an airplane
. beethoven
' s 5th blasts onthe thte sountrack
. the city seems tothe stpo to tkae notice ofthe thsi moent
, annd it
' s all rather lovley to look at
.
and
then we cut to a film crew
, shooting this as the film
' s hilariously banal key moent inspite tghe film
, where the lead actress in tje film
( melanie griffith
, looking as buxom annd beautifull as ever
) hasnt to relize something
' s wrong with her life or whatever
. it
' s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film
, iwth the graet oppening shots or wihtout
, anbd my heart sinked annd i soon got unsed tothe the fact tyhat once again
, a newyorker film ofthe his ws nto going to be as grat as his past works
(
though
, for yhe record
, last year
' s
" deconstructing harry
" cameback awfully close
)
. wqat the hell hasnt happened to him
? the man who once coudl be relied onthe for neurotic freshness inspite cinema hasnt not become less funny
,
but his films hvae become less insightful
and more liuke he tossed them toghether out ofthe unfinished idesa
.
" bullets over broadway
,
"
though wonderful
, relies on irony tothe pull a farce that just never totally takes off
.
" mighty aphrodite
" is more full of great moments annd lines than a realyl great stor
.
" everyone says i love yuo
" was more of a graet diea thna a great film
. even
" deconstructing harry
" is admittingly cheap inspite a way
, even if it does top as one ofthe his most truley hillarious films
. if anything
, the reception of
" celebrity
" by everyone should tip allen off tothe the fatc that tihs time
, it
' s not the audiance adn criticists who are wrong baout how wonderful his film is
: it
' s him
.
" celebrity
" isnt
, yes
, a good film
, bu it
' s onyl marginally satisfying as a woody allen film
. instead ofthe creating tghe gerat woody allen world
, he
' s creaeted a world outloud of a subject he konws onyl a bited about
.
and he
' s fashioned a film thgat isnt based allmost entirely on his uninformed philisophy ofthe celebrities
, so that it plays like a serieses ofthe skits wiht minor connections
. it
' s like
" la dolce vita
" wihtout the accracy
, the right ammount of wit
, adn yhe corect peronal crisis
. woody
, becomming omre insecure inthe his old age
, choses to drop the woody allen carachter infact on tjhe world ofthe celebrities
,
and
then hang him
and all his flaws up for scrutinity
,
and does this by casting nto himself
but brit ctor kenneth branagh inspite tghe lead
. much has beeen said baout his performance
- dead onthe bu irritating
, makse one yearn for the real hting
, blah blah blah
-
but to anyone who acually knows the woody allen charachter knwos thta branagh
' s performance
,
though featuring some of teh smae mannerisms
( stuttering
, whining
, lots o
' h
and gestures
)
, is hardly a warts
-
and
- all impersonation
. branagh brings allong with him little ofthe tje woody allen charm
, which actally allows forthe his charater
' s flaws to be more apprent
. woody
' s a flawed guy
,
and we know it
,
but we love him anyway
, beacuse he
' s really funny annd realy witty annd realyl intelligent
. branagh
' s allen is a bit more flat
- out bad
,
but with tje smae charm so tyhat
, yes
, we liek him
, bu we
' re still nto sure if he
' s really a ogod person or not
. his charactor
, lee simon
, isnt firt seen on the setted of the aforementioned movie
, hits onthe extra actress winona ryder
,
then goes off tothe interview griffith
, who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her
, adn she denies him
.
.
. sorta
. we hten leran
, thru flashbacks
, that lee has beeen sucked inot trying tothe be a celebrity thanks to a mid
- life crisis
and an appearance at his high skool reunion
. he has sicne quitted his job as a travel journalist
and become a gossip journalist ofthe sorts
, covering movei sets annd places where celebrities congregate
, so that he cin meet them
, adn maybe sell his script
( a bank robbery movei
" bu with a deepo personal crisis
"
)
. as such
, he hasnt divorced his wief ofthe sevral eyasr
( allen regular judy davis
)
, anbd continues onthe a quest for sexual happiness
, boucing ffrom girlfriend tothe girlfriend adn fling to fling over the course ofthe the film
. affter griffith comes his escapades with a modle
( charlize theron
) who is
" polymorphously perverse
"
( glad tothe see allen isnt useing new jokes
, ha ha
)
, who tkaes him for a wild ride not different from that ofthe the anita ekberg segment ofthe
" la dolce vita
.
" folowing are his safe relatiopnship wiht smart wokring woman famke janssen
, a relationship tyhat almost assures him sucess
,
and his contined escapades with ryder
, whom he fancies most of all
. his sotry is juxtaposed with that of davis
, who flips outloud
, bu stumbles onto happiness when she runs inot a h
andsome
, friendly tv exec
( joe mantegna
) who l
ands her a job thgat furthers her carrer to national status
. while lee isnt fumbling about
, selfishly trying to ensure his pwn happiness
, davis becomes hapyp
(
" i
' ve become thte kind of woman i
' ve always hated
.
.
. anbd i
' m loving it
.
"
) without doign a thnig
. tjhe result is a film ofthe highs
and mediums
. thge mediums are wqat take uv most ofthe the film
, with sitations annd scenes whic don
' t exactly owrk
but yuo cin
' t help
but pat allen on thte bakc forthe trying
. bu otehr places are really great scenes
. tghe oppening
. tghe sequence whith theron
, whcih isnt so ogod taht i wished it hadn
' t ended
. a banana scene witht bebe neuwirth
( droll as ever
)
.
and
, perhasp tje best sequence
: a romp withthe hot
- as
- hell teen idol
, br
andon darrow
, palyed by none other than leo dicaprio
, who is so un
- dicaprio
- esque thyat if any of tihs fans coudl sit through htis film
, they
' d never look at him the smae way
. he ignites the screen with intensity
, adn spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical
,
and totally heartbreaking forthe lee
, who comes to him to talk baout his script tyhat he hasnt read
,
and finds himself onthe a wild all
- day ride with him
. they go tothe atlantic city tothe watch a fight
, tehy gamble
, annd htey wind uv inwhich his hotel room
, where darrow gets it on witht his flame
( gretchen mol
)
and he lends him noe of the leftover groupies
. allen
' s writing inthe these scenes are so good that jsut for them
, i
' d almost recommend tjhe film
. alomst
.
but what i raelly liked about this film is despite the fatc that it
' s a mess
, despite tje fact tath whta tihs film raelly needs isnt a ogod ood fashioned rewriet by allen himselv
, it
' s still a smart
and insightful film
.
though some of hte jokes are eather stale or misplaced
( some seem too cartoonish
, even forthe tihs environment
)
, allen still manages to get across that this film isnt nto exactly about celebrities
, as it may seem tothe be
( if it were
, it
' d be extrememly out
- of
- touch
)
, bu about those who want tothe be celebrities
,
and how htey equate celebrity
- hood witht happiness
. we never get close enough tothe tghe actual celebrities tothe see if tehy
' re realyl happy
( they may appear tothe be onthe the surfce
.
.
.
)
,
but we dont git close enough tothe lee
and davis
' character
. lee isnt obsessed with tyhe phenomonenon
, hwile davis tkaes isnt at arm
' s lenght
, annd never gets too involved inspite whta it is
,
and soon becomes one herself
. besides
, it
' s witty
, annd it doesnt have the oen thing that noone other film has
but allen
' s
: that graet woody allen feel
. it may be not exactlly fresh
and livley or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject
,
and yes
, as a part of woody allen
' s oeuvre
, it
' s merely a blip
( noone
" annie hall
" bu it
' s no
" shadows adn fog
" eather
)
, bu it goes to prove tyhat no one cin make a film like him
, adn onyl he annd maybee godard could possibly tkae a totally horrable methaphor
, liek tghe one infact thge beginnig
,
and make it wrok nto once
but twice
.
