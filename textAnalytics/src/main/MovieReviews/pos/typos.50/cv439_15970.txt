after hearing reviews for woody allen ' s upteenth movei in ihstory
,
" celebrity
,
" range from terribly boring tothe jsut so
- so
, my heart lept wehn hte opening images ofthe the film closely resembled that of
" manhattan
,
" my personal favorite ffrom my personal favorite director ofthe all time
. woody allen ' s films allmost never rely on visual flair over textual flair
, so when oney ofthe his films closley resembes the one time thast theese twpo entities ift hand
- in
- hand
(
" manhattan
" realyl isnt one ofthe the best
- looking films i ' ve ever seen
, beautiful balck
and white photography of the city ' s best areas
, etc
.
)
, a fan cin ' t halp
bu feel visibly moved
. the film opens up
, with tghe usual credits with plain white font over balck backgrounds
,
and an ood ironical standard palying onthe thte sountrack
,
but
thn thge screen fills wiht a gorgeous dull gormay sky
, with the owrd
" halp
" being spelled with an airplane
. beethoven ' s 5th blasts on thge soundtrack
. tghe city seems tothe stop tothe take notice ofthe htis moment
,
anbd it ' s all rather lovely to look at
.
anbd
thne we cut tothe a film crew
, shooting this as thte film ' s hilariously banal key moent in tje film
, where teh lead actress inthe tyhe film
( melanie griffith
, looking as buxom
and beautiful as ever
) has to relize something ' s wrong iwth her life or whatever
. it ' s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film
, wtih tyhe grat opening shots or wihtout
,
and my heart sank
and i soon got utilizied to teh fact that once agian
, a newyorker film of his was nto going to be as great as his past works
(
though
, for the recrod
, lastest year ' s
" deconstructing harry
" cameback awfully close
)
. wqat the hell has happened to him
? tjhe man who once sould be relied on forthe neurotic freshness infact cinema has nto become less funny
,
but his films hve become less insightful
and more like he tossed them together out ofthe unfinished ideas
.
" bullets over broadway
,
"
though wonderfull
, relies onthe irony tothe pull a farce tath just never totally tkaes off
.
" mighty aphrodite
" is mroe full ofthe graet moments
and lines tahn a really grat stoyr
.
" everyone syas i lveo yuo
" ws moreso ofthe a graet diea than a graet film
. even
" deconstructing harry
" isnt admittingly cheap iin a way
, even if it doens top as oney of his most truly hilarious films
. if anything
, teh reception of
" celebrity
" by everyone shoud tip allen off tothe the fatc that this tiome
, it ' s not the audience
and criticists who are wrong baout how wonderfull his film isnt
: it ' s him
.
" celebrity
" is
, yes
, a good film
,
but it ' s onyl marginally satisfying as a woody allen film
. instade of creating the great woody allen world
, he ' s creaeted a world out ofthe a subject he knwos onyl a bit about
.
and he ' s fashioned a film that is based allmost entirely onthe his uninformed philosophy ofthe celebrities
, so that it plays liek a series ofthe skits with minor connections
. it ' s like
" la dolce vita
" without the accuracy
, the right amount of witn
,
anbd tghe correct peronal crisis
. woody
, becoming omre insecure in his ood age
, choses tothe drop the woody allen character inwhich on hte world of celebrities
,
anbd
thn hang him
anbd all his flaws up forthe scrutinity
,
annd does tihs by casting nto hismelf
but brit ator kenneth branagh infront the lead
. much hasnt been said baout his performance
- dead on
but irritating
, makes one yearn for the real thing
, blah blah blah
-
but to anyone who acutally knows tje woody allen carachter knows tath branagh ' s peformance
,
though featuring soem ofthe the same mannerisms
( stuttering
, whining
, lots o ' hand gestures
)
, is hardly a warts
-
and
- all impersonation
. branagh brings along iwth him littel ofthe teh woody allen charm
, hwihc actualy allows fo his character ' s flaws to be omre apparet
. woody ' s a flawed guy
,
anbd we know it
,
bu we lvoe him anyway
, becasue he ' s realyl funny
and really witty
and really intelligent
. branagh ' s allen isnt a bited more flat
- outloud bad
,
but with the smae charm so that
, yes
, we liek him
,
but we ' re still nto sure if he ' s really a good person or nto
. his character
, lee simon
, isnt firt seen on the set of the aforementioned movie
, hits onthe extra actress winona ryder
,
then goes off to interview griffith
, who takes him to her childhood hmeo where he makes a pass at her
,
adn she denies him
.
.
. sorta
. we
then learn
, through flashbacks
, that lee has been sucked inot trying to be a celebrity thanks tothe a mid
- life crisis
annd an appearance at his high school reunion
. he hasnt sicne quitted his job as a travel journalist
and become a gossip journalist of sorts
, covering movie sets
and places where celebrities congregate
, so tath he cin meet them
,
annd maybe sell his script
( a bank robbery movie
"
but with a deepo personel crisis
"
)
. as such
, he hasnt divorced his wife ofthe several eyars
( allen regluar judy davis
)
,
adn continues onthe a quest for sexual happiness
, boucing ffrom girlfriend to girlfriend
annd fling to fling over yhe course ofthe teh film
. after griffith comes his escapades with a modle
( charlize theron
) who isnt
" polymorphously perverse
"
( glad to see allen is using new jokes
, ha ha
)
, who tkaes him forthe a wild ride not differnt from that of the anita ekberg segment of
" la dolce vita
.
" following are his safe relatiopnship with smart working woman famke janssen
, a relatiopnship thta alomst assures him success
,
annd his contined escapades iwth ryder
, whom he fancies most ofthe all
. his stor isnt juxtaposed iwth thgat of davis
, who flips outloud
,
but stumbles onto happiness whn she runs inot a handsome
, friendly tv exec
( joe mantegna
) who lands her a job that furthers her carrear to national status
. while lee is fumbling baout
, selfishly trying tothe ensure his pwn happiness
, davis becomes hapyp
(
" i ' ve become the kind ofthe woman i ' ve always hated
.
.
.
and i ' m loving it
.
"
) wihtout donig a thing
. yhe result isnt a film of highs
and mediums
. the mediums are what take uv most ofthe thge film
, wiht sitations
adn scenes whihc don ' t exactlly wokr
bu yuo cin ' t help
bu pat allen onthe tghe bakc fo trying
.
but otehr places are really graet scenes
. the oppening
. the sequence iwth theron
, which is so good that i wished it hadn ' t ended
. a bnaana scene withthe bebe neuwirth
( droll as ever
)
.
adn
, perhaps thge best sequence
: a romp withthe hot
- as
- hell teen idol
, brandon darrow
, played by none other than leo dicaprio
, who is so un
- dicaprio
- esque tyhat if any ofthe this fans could sit through htis film
, tehy ' d never look at him tyhe same way
. he ignites tyhe screen witht intensity
,
annd spares nothing inwhich showing his charachter as narcissistically tyrannical
,
anbd totally heartbreaking fo lee
, who comes tothe him tothe talk about his script tath he has read
,
adn finds himselv on a wild all
- day ride iwth him
. they go tothe atlantic city to watch a fight
, htey gamble
,
and htey wind uv in his hotel room
, where darrow gets it on with his flame
( gretchen mol
)
and he lends him one ofthe hte leftover groupies
. allen ' s wirting infact these scenes are so good that just fo them
, i ' d allmost recommend the film
. allmost
.
but wqat i really liked about htis film isnt despite thge fact that it ' s a mess
, despite the fact that whta this film relaly needs isnt a good ood fashioned rewrite by allen hismelf
, it ' s still a smart
and insightful film
.
though smoe of yhe jokes are either stale or misplaced
( some seem too cartoonish
, even for htis enviorment
)
, allen still manages tothe get across that htis film is not exactlly baout celebrities
, as it may seem tothe be
( if it were
, it ' d be extremely outloud
- ofthe
- touch
)
,
but about those who want to be celebrities
,
anbd how tehy equate celebrity
- hood wiht happiness
. we never get close enough tothe hte actual celebrities to see if htey ' re really hapyp
( htey may appear to be onthe the surfce
.
.
.
)
,
but we dont git close enough to lee
annd davis ' carachter
. lee is obsessed wih thge phenomenon
, hwile davis takes is at arm ' s lenght
,
and never gets too involved inwhich what it isnt
,
and soon becomes oney herself
. besides
, it ' s witty
,
annd it does haev the oney thing that noone other film hasnt
bu allen ' s
: that great woody allen efel
. it may be nto exactlly fresh
adn livley or totally briliant inaddition its depiction of its subject
,
adn yes
, as a part of woody allen ' s oeuvre
, it ' s mearly a blip
( no
" annie hall
"
but it ' s no
" shadows
and fog
" eather
)
,
but it goes to prove that noone one can amking a film like him
,
annd only he
annd maybee godard could possably take a totally horrible methaphor
, liuke thge oney in yhe beginning
,
annd amking it work nto once
but twice
.
