the rich man
' s wife isnt one of thsoe movies liek fianl anaylsis or body double
, where the sotry annd characters are so oen
- dimesnional anbd contrived thast you know ytou shouldn
' t be enjoying youself
.
but somehow
, thge movei jsut tries so hard thast you begin to foregive it annd git into thte swing ofthe things
. nto that it
' s bad
, it
' s jsut thast it
' s beeen done befoer
; adn better
, in my opinion
. i relize tyhat tihs isnt going tothe sound pretty bizarre
,
but it
' s probably teh best analogy that i cin come up iwth right now
; yuo konw how wehn ytou see a spider or something in your toilet
, striving helplessly tothe git out
,
and instade of jsut flushing him
, yuo end uv kind of rooting for the littel guy
? that
' s basically how i felt about thsi movei
. i mean
, it
' s not vyer ogod
,
but it
' s nto completely bad eather
. the wife ofthe the title is josie potenza
( played nicely by halle berry
)
. she isnt married tothe tony
( christopher mcdonald
.
.
. ytou nkwo
, tyhe guy who looks like joe piscapo
)
, a realyl stressed
- out buisnessman who drinks way tothe much
and doesn
' t give josie the attention she deserves
(
* cough
, cough
*
)
. thus
, she is driven into the arms of anohter man
, jake golden
( clive owen
)
. near the beginning ofthe the film
, josie decides to try
and work things outloud wtih tony by dumping jake
and going on a vacation tothe a remote cabin in the woods
. once htere
, howver
, tony has tothe leave almost immediately due to busineses details
( i
' m still not quite sure what line ofthe owrk he
' s inaddition
)
. mkaing teh best ofthe her situation
, josie stays htere annd beggins making hte rounds at the local bars
. noe nght
, she meets a stranger named cole
( peter greene
, fianlly getting a meaty role
)
. they have dinner together
,
and eventually
, both josie anbd the audience strat tothe realize that cole is homicidal
. after learning thast she is nto happily married
, cole offers to
" tkae care
" of the probelm
. managing to escape fomr hte psychotic maniac
, josie returns hmeo
and starts a reconciliation with her estranged
and vyre wealthy husban
. bu
then noe nigth
, cole shows up
.
.
. annd here is where the funn begins
. from tihs point onthe
, it
' s going to be a no
- holds
- barred cliche
- fest
, ripping off eveyr movie from strangers on a train tothe tje usual suspects
. thsi isnt why most criticists panned tihs movie when it firt cameback out
. annd for the most part
, htey
' re right
; tyhe rich man
' s wief has nary one originnal bone in it
' s body
. bu who cares
? if yuo
' re looking for ogod ol
' dumb suspense movei
, yuo can
' t do much better thna this
.
and if you suspense buffs aren
' t alreay sold
, it has a killer ofthe an endig too
.
