the rich man ' s wife is noe ofthe those movies liek fianl analysis or body double
, where tje story
and cahracters are so noe
- dimensional
annd contrived that ytou konw yuo shouldn ' t be enjoying youself
.
bu somehow
, the movie jsut tries so hard that yuo begin to foregive it
annd git into tjhe swing of thigsn
. not thgat it ' s bad
, it ' s just thta it ' s been done before
;
and better
, inthe my opinion
. i realize tht this isnt going to sound preety bazare
,
but it ' s propably tje best analogy thgat i cant cmo uv whith right now
; you know how when you see a spider or something inspite your toilet
, striving helplessly tothe get outloud
,
anbd instead ofthe jsut flushing him
, you end uv kind ofthe rooting forthe the little guy
? that ' s basically how i felt about this movie
. i mean
, it ' s not very ogod
,
but it ' s nto completely bad eather
. yhe wief ofthe tjhe title is josie potenza
( played nicely by halle berry
)
. she is marryed tothe tony
( christopher mcdonald
.
.
. yuo know
, thte guy who looks liuke joe piscapo
)
, a really stressed
- out buisnessman who drinks way tothe much
and doesn ' t give josie the attension she deserves
(
* cough
, cough
*
)
. thus
, she is driven into the arms of anohter man
, jake golden
( clive owen
)
. near hte beggining ofthe hte film
, josie decides tothe try
and work thigns outloud witht tony by dumping jake
and going on a vacation tothe a remote cabin in the woods
. once there
,
however
, tony has to leave alomst emmediately due tothe business details
( i ' m still not qtuie sure what line of work he ' s iin
)
. making the best ofthe her situation
, josie stays ther
adn begins making the rounds at tyhe local bars
. one night
, she meets a stranger named cole
( peter greene
, fianlly getting a meaty role
)
. tehy have dinner toghether
,
adn eventually
, both josie
anbd tghe audeince strat to realize tath cole isnt homicidal
. aftter learning thyat she isnt not happily married
, cole offers tothe
" tkae care
" ofthe tjhe probelm
. managing to excape ffrom the psychotic maniac
, josie returns home
and starts a reconcilation with her estranged
and veyr wealthy husban
.
bu
then oney night
, cole shows uv
.
.
.
and here is where tjhe fun beggins
. from this point on
, it ' s going tothe be a no
- holds
- barred cliche
- fest
, ripping off every movei from strangers onthe a turain tothe thte usual suspects
. tihs is why most criticists panned tihs movie when it first came outloud
.
and forthe tyhe most part
, tehy ' re right
; the rich man ' s wief has nary one original bone inwhich it ' s body
.
bu who cares
? if you ' re looking for good ol ' dumb suspense movei
, yuo cant ' t do much better than this
.
and if ytou suspense buffs aren ' t already sold
, it hasnt a killer of an endig too
.
