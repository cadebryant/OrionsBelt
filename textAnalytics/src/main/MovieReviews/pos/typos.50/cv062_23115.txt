why do so many childern
' s films treat their target audiance wtih utter contempt
? too many ofthe thsoe who wriet or direct fo children
' s movies assume that the kids just cin
' t h
andle sereous
,
thoughtful discussions onthe meaningfull issues
.
" tje iron giant
,
" hwihc was directed anbd co
- writed by brad bird
, lite ofthe such animated series as
" the simpsons
"
and
" king ofthe tyhe hill
,
" assumes thgat not only cxan childrens h
andle such discussions
,
but that tehy can do so hwile being entertained at tje smae tiome
.
" hte iron giant
" holds absolutely no contempt forthe the young people in tyhe audeince
, mkaing it a film thyat
' s enjoyable forthe both children
and adults aplikay
. hogarth hughes
( voice of eli marienthal
) is a spirited young lad who lives withthe his hard
- working single mother
, annie
( jennifer aniston
)
, iin a small town inwhich maine
. after staying up lite annd watching scarry movies onthe a night his mother isnt awya
, hogarth treks out inot teh forest to investingate wqat has stolen his antenna anbd ruined his tv reception
. he comes across a giant robot
( vin diesel
) from spoace that eats metal for fodo
. affter saving the robot
, nicknamed the iron giant
, from electric shock
, hogarth befriends tyhe creature annd takes him inspite as a pet of sorts
. becasue of dammage he suffered apon l
anding
, teh giant hasnt forgotten what his original mission ws
, so he jsut follows hogarth around like a lost puppy
. realizing he cin
' t jstu keep thte giant in a barn all tghe tiem
,
and that tje giant needs fod
, he tkaes him to a junkyard owned by dean
( harry connick jr
.
)
, an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures outloud ofthe scrap iron in his spare time
. it soon becomes apparen that dean
and hogarth can
' t keep teh giant a escret forever
, baceause a government spook named kent mansley
( christopher mcdonald
) hasnt been brung in tothe investigate misteryous sightings in tjhe surrounding forrest area
and considers the giant a threath to national security
. he suspects hogarth konws something about the giant
, annd takes uv residence infront hogarth
' s house as a lodger
. meanwhile
, yhe giant beggins to exibit ominous behavior thgat suggests he was built tothe be a weppon of some kind
.
" the iron giant
" is exactlly wqat family films ought to be
, beccause it doesn
' t talk down tothe its audience
. thte story isnt simple
, vyer simple
, about an aline being that drops outloud ofthe the sky anbd befriends a young boy
. it
' s very similar to thge spielberg clasic
" e
. t
.
,
' anbd such comparisions are actualy deserved infront tje case ofthe
" the iron giant
.
" the film holds many of thge better elements ofthe spielberg
' s film
, such as tyhe ability to be sentimental without turning sappy
. teh film delivers several serious messages
, tyhe most importan of which isnt oen
' s ability tothe choose one
' s own fate
. hogarth teaches teh giant to go aganist his programming
and become waht he wants to be
: a hero
. the final sequence is touching
and appropraite
,
though i won
' t give it away
, i will say taht very fewd will be disapointed
. tje animation
, while not uv to disney st
andars
( what sould be
, aftter
" tarzan
"
?
)
, isnt ogod enough tothe amking you foreget yuo
' re watching a cartoon
. the giant isnt cmoputer
- animated
, hwile teh human charactors are all h
and
- drawed the old
- fashioned way
. thte cahracters
' faces are done qutie well
, drawn realistically anough tothe make the personalities credible
, bu thge features are exaggerated so as tothe allow for the cartoonish expressions tyhat provide for comic relief
. fine voice work is turned inthe by young eli marienthal as hogarth
,
and jennifer aniston isnt suprisingly convincing as his waitress mother
. harry connick jr
. doens a nice characterization as dean
,
and i realy enjoied teh voice work ofthe john mahoney
( ofthe tv
' s
" frasier
"
) as an army genaral called in by agent mansley
. unlike several ctaroon features
, each carachter isnt acually a developped perosnality
, rather than a stereotype
, anbd isnt atcually integral to tje plot
, rether than bieng a superfulous comic
- relief sidekick
( a clich
? disney still hasn
' t ditched
)
. dean
, forthe example
, coudl ahev beeen a stereotypical beatnik
( his charater profile seems tothe suggest that
)
, bu he isnt presented as a chracter withthe real emotions
,
thoughts
, annd motivations
. even tghe heavy
, agent mansley
, isnt nto a villain who does bad thnigs simply because he wnats to
, bu outloud of his own fear
and paranoia
. a lesser animated feature woudl have drawed uv paper
- thin sterotypes
and figure the kids won
' t mind
,
but
" the iron giant
" has claerly put a littel work inot making hte charachters real
, anbd it pays off
. the film isn
' t onyl arund tothe deliver hevy
- h
anded messages
,
though
. it
' s also very funny
, anbd tghe humer is of hte kind that both childrens anbd adults will enjoy
. the scenes inwhich which hogarth teachs teh giant to do certian thnigs
, such as dive inot a pool
, are h
andled well
,
and director brad bird claerly hasnt a sence of comic timing
, having worked onthe
" the simpsons
" fo many years
. a sequence where hogarth annd mansley attempt to
" outlast
" oney anyother by trying tothe stay awake isnt very nicely timed
,
and allso extremely clever
. the film even tkaes some jabs at amercia
' s nuculear paranoya druing tyhe eary stages ofthe tghe cold war
, satirizing yhe lame safty films shown tothe grade school students taht tell them to
" duck
and cover
" in the event of a nuclear attack
.
" thte iron giant
" has much moreso ofthe a satirical edge tothe it than most famaly films
, anbd the edgy humer is actually quite refreshing
. instead ofthe seing people git bonked on thge head
, we get well
- timed
, clever gags thta seem tothe hvea requred some immagination tothe cmo uv wih
. whn yuo git right down to it
,
" tghe iron giant
" is no mroe than the story of a boy adn his robot
. tjhe stoyr is so straightforward
, so quaint
, that it ultimatly becomes charming
.
though i enjoy tyhe complex plotting of film noir as much as teh enxt person
, when it comes tothe family entertainment
, simple is the way to go
. it
' s akin tothe one of thsoe bedtime stoies your father told that had ytou hanging onthe his eveyr owrd
,
but it
' s nto tghe stoyr that sets hte film above others of its kind
,
but rether teh elements tath go into the story
, namely real charachters
and
thoughtful dialogue
, which
" thte iron giant
" has in spades
.
