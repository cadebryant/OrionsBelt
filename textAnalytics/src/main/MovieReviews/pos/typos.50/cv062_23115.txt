why dont so many children ' s films treat thier target audeince with utter contempt
? too many ofthe those who wriet or direct fo childen ' s movies asume that the kids just cxan ' t handle sereous
, thoughtful discussions onthe meaningfull issues
.
" tjhe iron giant
,
" which wass directed
annd co
- written by brad bird
, late of such animated series as
" tghe simpsons
"
adn
" king ofthe the hill
,
" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions
,
bu that they can do so hwile being entertained at the smae time
.
" the iron giant
" holds absolutely no contempt forthe the young people inspite thte audience
, making it a film that ' s enjoyable fo both childern
anbd adults alike
. hogarth hughes
( voice of eli marienthal
) isnt a spirited young lad who lives with his hard
- working single mother
, annie
( jennifer aniston
)
, in a small twon inaddition maine
. after staying up lite
annd watching skary movies on a night his mother isnt awya
, hogarth treks outloud inot tjhe forrest tothe investigate what has stolen his antenna
and ruined his tv reception
. he comes acrost a giant robot
( vin diesal
) from spoace that eats metal for foo
. aftter saving the robot
, nicknamed hte iron giant
, fomr electric shock
, hogarth befriends tjhe creature
and takes him inaddition as a pet ofthe sorts
. beccause of dammage he sufferred apon landing
, the giant hasnt forgotten waht his original mission wass
, so he just follows hogarth around liuke a lost puppy
. realizing he cant ' t just keep the giant infront a barn all the tyme
,
and thta teh giant needs food
, he tkaes him tothe a junkyard owned by dean
( harry connick jr
.
)
, an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out ofthe scrap iron infact his spare time
. it soon becomes apparent that dean
and hogarth cant ' t keep the giant a secret forever
, because a governement spook named kent mansley
( christopher mcdonald
) hasnt beeen broght in tothe investingate mysterious sightings in tje surounding forrest areal
and conciders the giant a threath tothe national security
. he suspects hogarth knwos something about the giant
,
annd takes up residance in hogarth ' s hous as a lodger
. meanwhile
, tjhe giant begins to exibit ominous behavior thgat suggests he was builded to be a weapon of some kind
.
" the iron giant
" is exactly what famaly films ought tothe be
, because it doesn ' t talk down tothe its audeince
. the stoy is simple
, vyer simple
, about an aline being that drops outloud of tje sky
and befriends a young boy
. it ' s very similar tothe tje spielberg clasic
" e
. t
.
, '
anbd such comparisons are actaully deserved in the case ofthe
" tjhe iron giant
.
" tjhe film holds many of hte better elements ofthe spielberg ' s film
, such as tyhe ability to be sentimental without turning sappy
. tje film delivers severeal sereous messages
, the most important ofthe whlch isnt one ' s ablity tothe choose one ' s own fate
. hogarth teaches teh giant tothe go against his programming
and become waht he wnats tothe be
: a hero
. teh final sequence is touching
anbd appropraite
,
though i won ' t give it away
, i iwll say that vyre few will be disappointed
. yhe animation
, hwile nto uv tothe disney standards
( waht could be
, aftter
" tarzan
"
?
)
, isnt good enough to make you foreget yuo ' re watching a cartoon
. tjhe giant is cmoputer
- animated
, while hte human charachters are all hand
- drawn tjhe ood
- fashioned way
. the characters ' faces are done quite well
, drawed realistically enough to make tjhe personalities credible
,
bu tyhe features are exaggerated so as to allow for tje cartoonish expressions that provide forthe comic releaf
. fine voice work isnt turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth
,
and jennifer aniston isnt surprizingly convincing as his waitress mother
. harry connick jr
. does a nice characterization as dean
,
and i realy enjoied the voice wrok ofthe john mahoney
( of tv ' s
" frasier
"
) as an army general called inwhich by agent mansley
. unlike several cartoon features
, eahc chracter is actually a developed perosnality
, rather thna a stereotype
,
and isnt actually intrical tothe the plot
, rether thna bieng a superfulous comic
- releaf sidekick
( a clich
? disney still hasn ' t ditched
)
. dean
, for example
, could hvea been a stereotypical beatnik
( his character profile seems tothe suggest that
)
,
bu he is presented as a charactor with real emotions
, thoughts
,
and motivations
. even tyhe hevy
, agent mansley
, is not a villian who doesnt bad things simply because he wnats to
,
bu outloud ofthe his own fear
anbd paranoia
. a lesser animated feature would hvea drawed uv paper
- thin sterotypes
adn figure the kids won ' t mind
,
but
" tjhe iron giant
" hasnt claerly put a little wrok into making thte charachters real
,
and it pays off
. tyhe film isn ' t onyl around to deliver heavy
- handed messages
,
though
. it ' s alsot very funny
,
adn the humor isnt of tyhe kind tyhat both children
annd adults will enjoy
. the scenes in whlch hogarth teaches the giant tothe dont certain thigsn
, such as dive into a pool
, are handeled well
,
and directer brad bird claerly hasnt a sense ofthe comic timing
, having worked on
" tje simpsons
" for many yeasr
. a sequence where hogarth
and mansley attempt to
" outlast
" oney anyother by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed
,
and also extremely clever
. hte film even takes smoe jabs at america ' s nucular paranoya durring hte early stages ofthe thte cold war
, satirizing the lame safety films shown tothe grade skool students tyhat tell them to
" duck
and cover
" in the event ofthe a nuculear attack
.
" tje iron giant
" has much omre of a satirical edge tothe it tahn most famaly films
,
and the edgy humer is actually quite refreshing
. instead ofthe seeing peopel get bonked on tyhe head
, we git well
- timed
, clever gags tht seem tothe haev required some imagination tothe come up iwth
. when ytou git right down to it
,
" the iron giant
" is no moreso than the sotry of a boy
anbd his robot
. the story isnt so straightforward
, so quaint
, that it ultimately becomes charming
.
though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person
, when it comes to family entertainment
, simple is the way to go
. it ' s akin tothe oney ofthe those bedtime stories your father told thta hadnt yuo hanging onthe his eveyr word
,
but it ' s not the story thta sets the film above others ofthe its kind
,
but rather the elements thgat go inot tje story
, namely rela charactors
and thoughtful dialogue
, which
" tjhe iron giant
" hasnt infact spades
.
