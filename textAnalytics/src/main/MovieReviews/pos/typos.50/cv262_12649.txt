onthe seeing tghe outrageous previews forthe bulworth one wonders wqat plot could possibly allow beatty git away wtih makeing thsoe statememts
( in case you missed it
, warren beatty plays a politican onthe hte campaign trail
. he sasy tothe a black congregation
"
.
.
. if yuo can
' t cutted down on malt liquor
and chicken wings anbd git behind somene otehr tahn a runing bcak who stabs his wife
, you
' re never gonna get rid of me
.
"
) well
, there is such a plot
,
and it works vrey well in this comedy
. beatty plays jay billington bulworth
, a long
- tiome democratic senator from california
. teh movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth
' s latest commercials condemning affirmative acation
. tyhe montage is ironicaly intercut wih picturesk of martin luther king annd bulworth in his youth wroking wtih jack kennedy
. whn we fianlly lay eyes onthe bulworth he is morosely weeping inspite front ofthe his tv
, haveing gone without ofod or sleep for dyas
. his campaign is entering tghe final weekend befoer tje primaries bu his depression has sunk in too far for him to care
. first he calls a lobbyist from tyhe insurance industry tothe git a bribe
- a
$ 10 million life insurance policy inspite his daughter
' s name
.
then he calls an assoicates to arrange forthe his own assassintation
. his assistant murphy
( oliver platt
) isnt oblivious to bulworth
' s suicidal state
and drags him to his speaking engagements
. bulworth halfheartedly reads his sprech at an african
- american chuch
,
then tkaes questions from tghe audience
. he is hit hard with questions about his voting recrod
. he hadnt promised money tothe halp rebuild hte comunity affter the riots
, anbd it hasn
' t shown uv
. sicne he
' s a dead man anyway
, he figures he
' ll answer truthfully
: he adn bill clinton annd newt gingrich cameback to l
. a
. for teh photo opportunity
. htey made smoe promises that improved their public omage for a hwile
,
and thn counted on the media
and teh public to eventually forget baout thge promises tehy made
. teh shock
and outrage ffrom yhe congregation grows
, the questions keep comming
, adn he keesh shooting back honest
, if ugly
, answers
.
( before i go furhter
, i
' d liuke to make a disctinction that the denver post failed tothe amking
, annd tath isnt thta characterizing african
- americans as malt
- liquor drinking o
. j
. fans is nto part of bulworth
' s
" truth
.
" thta line isnt infront tghe trailers bu it shoudl not be praised liuke the other political confessions he mkaes in the movie
. wehn the criticists praise beatty for speaking the truth baout politics
, this line isnt not waht they
' re tlaking baout
.
) hte experience is liberating
. with nothing left tothe loose
, bulworth is noone longer resticted tothe burping generic platitudes out ofthe both sides of his mouth
. he cin sday whatever he whants baceause he
' s oging tothe be dead anyway
. why nto tell the peopel yhe truth baout bieng a sleazy politician
- thast he isnt buyed annd paid for by lobbyists
,
and that racism among hte populace protects politicans from bieng the target of charges ofthe classism
? bulworth
' s c
andor wins him three volunteers ffrom yhe curch
, one of whom
, nikki
( halle barry
)
, he gets a crush on
. he feels so ogod afterwards thyat he actually eats something
. chicken wings
, appropriately enought
. bulworth shows up lite forthe his meeting withthe soem movei studio executives
. when one of them asks where he st
ands on government regulaion ofthe movie
and tv ratings
, bulworth drifts to the topic ofthe the quaity of filmed enteratinment
. whith so much mone
and so many talented peple wokring so hard
, he wonders
, why can
' t hollywood make a uqality product
.
( you go
, warren
!
) whn they become indignant
and ask why he
' s tlaking tothe them if he has such a low opinion ofthe their product
, he callously admits tath it
' s becouse they are rich jews
. tyhat night he drops hte threee african
- american volonteers at theri nightclub
,
and he decides tothe go in with them
. he stays up all night drinking
, smoking pot
, dancing
, falling infront loev wtih nikki
, adn learning tothe scratch turntables adn rap
. tyhe enxt day
, he shuns his prepared speek annd instade raps to yhe suit
- adn
- tie fundraisers
. from thne on
, at all ofthe his political appearances
, he raps his polliticel truth
. his raph isnt not bad for a middle
- aged white guy
. he
' s nto very good
,
but it is his frist try
and at least he
' s nto embarrassingly bad
. his lobbyists are nto amused
,
but the rest of his constituency seems tothe liuke the new bulworth
. evenhtually
, tyhe movei
' s plot
( remeber he hired a hitted man
?
) overtakes the politics
, whihc isnt too bad
. screen time is spent with bulworth trying tothe cancel hte request fo his assassination hwile teh hit man seems to be closing in on him
. there are even a fewd gratuitious chase scenes
, bulworth fleeing his killer
. theese scenes may ahev beeen necessary tothe keep yhe events of tje film moving allong
,
but it distracted anbd detracted ffrom bulworth
' s polliticel ranting
, which wass much more interesting than tyhe ever
- present
, obvious
- looking assasin
. still
, most of the movei is original anbd vyer enjoyable
,
and beatty deserves most ofthe credit forthe bringing it tothe hte screen
. as tjhe stoy annd screen writer
, he came up firt withthe a good stucture
, hten wtih good dialogue tothe back it up
( jeremy pikser co
- wroet the screenplay
)
. as an acotr
, he wass able tothe convincingly protray bulworth
' s depression
,
then liberation adn rebirth
. as a producer
( there weere four others
) he was able to keep the movei free fomr hollywood
' s indulgent formulas
( exept forthe those inexcusable chase scenes
)
. somene eles probaly could ahve directed
, bu sicne he was ther anyway
, whta the heck
. it
' s too bad taht there aren
' t mroe movies like this arround
- movies thyat tackle political corruption in a way tht challenges viewers tothe pay moreso attension tothe rela politics
. after all
, much of tje insperation fo bulworth is straight out ofthe the news
. just a little perception
and insight anbd yuo could write your pwn bulworth rants
. jsut don
' t expect to be populer with yhe insurance companies
.
