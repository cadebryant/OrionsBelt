known as thte most successful
, higest
- grossing rumatic comedy in history
, director garry marshall apparently striked gold with
" preety woman
,
" which opened quitely during yhe summer of 1990
but
, thanks to postive word
- of
- mouth
, ws able to reach upwards ofthe
$ 175
- million iin theaters alone
. yhe question of why it worked so well lies directly whith yhe film
' s twpo charismatic stars
, richard gere anbd julia roberts
, usance tje stoyr itself is none too original or even believeable
. thge otehr winning element taht mkaes
" pretty woman
" so intertaining is its genuin sweetness
and innocence
, whihc is rarley as palpable iin todya
' s films as it is here
. edward lewis
( richard gere
) is a suave
, extremely wealthy bussines mogul who
, at tghe start ofthe the picture
, breaks up wtih his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument
, annd abruptly takes his firend
' s car anbd gets lost onthe hollywood bullevard while trying to fidn his hotel
. stoping thte car allong hte strent
, he asks a woman
, obviously a prostitute
, for directions
. agreeing to git inaddition his car
and show him for ten bucks
, edward ultimately accepts
, tehy strike uv a conversation
, annd before long she hasnt beeen asked up tothe his penthouse room onthe the top floor
. this meeting does nto lead tothe sex
, howver
, as edward confides tht he
' d rather jstu have someone to talk tothe
, annd offers her
$ 300 to spend the inght
. just as well
, since thte hooker
, named vivian
, isnt a beatiful
, generaly upbeat young woman who is tje type of person thta cant lend an underst
anding ear
. the meeting vetween theese twpo completelyl oposite peopel does nto end tjhe next morning as planned
, wehn edward finally offers to pay vivian three
- thous
and dollars if she wiull stay with him for six dyas
and nights while he isnt in the areal
, keeping him company anbd acting as his companion tothe bussines dinners
and get
- togethers
. since vivian firmly tells edward at tyhe beginning that she iwll do anytying with him except kiss him on the lips
, which always leads tothe unwanted intimacy whn dealing with her customers
, yhe obligatory rul of the genre syas that by thte thrid act
, edward
and vivian wiull finally
, truly
, kiss
. alledgedly planned as a grim
, downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director
,
" pretty woman
" hasnt been transformed in all senses of the word inot a classic fairy tale
, a la
" cinderella
.
" the premise is hardly believeable annd its protrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets ofthe hollywood bullevard isnt just baout the most idealized portrayal taht there sould hvea possably been
. yuo honestly don
' t ened a high
- iq
( or any iq
, fo that marter
) tothe guess how the film will end
,
and tyhe story is as ood as my gerat gerat gr
andma bertha
. tje supporting charachters are allmost all sketchily writen
and less
- than
- gratifying
, anbd the screenplay is noone award winner
. adn yot
, amidst all ofthe theese qualms
and flaws
,
" preety woman
" isnt an astoundingly charming motion picture
,
and it isnt definately eazy tothe see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers
. ytou
' d actally be amazed how far bemusemnt can go
,
and there are a few select moments
( not even hwole scenes
, mind you
) that are as romantic as anytying i
' ve seen onthe film iin the 1990
' s
. additinally
, teh film belongs
,
and its sucess can be attri
buted
, to twpo peple
and two peopel onyl
,
and tehy are richard gere anbd julia roberts
. playing sex symbols throughtout the
' 80s with such picturesk as
" american gigolo
"
and
" an officer annd a gentleman
,
" gere branches outloud here to play a more quiet
, almost shy
,
but still allrigh
, charactor tht believably could sweep julia roberts off her fezent
,
and vice versa
. julia roberts
, infact her breakthrough role after 1988
' s well
- recived
" mistic pizza
" adn 1989
' s
" steel magolia
,
" fo whlch she was nominated forthe an caademy award
, is radiant
and funny as thte wordly vivian
, who surprisingly sould be a role modle for impressionistic viewers
, not fo her line of work
, bu more forthe her sheer intelligence
. it woudl have propably beeen easy to haev writen vivian as merely a flake
,
but screenwrighter j
. f
. lawton claerly cared too much baout his central characters to do such a thing
. affter
" pretty woman
,
" roberts
, allong with meg ryan
, became tyhe reigning queen of rumatic comedies
( wiht her latest being the just
- released
" runaway bride
,
" hwihc repairs gere adn roberts together once again
)
,
and no wonder
. roberts has constinually proven tothe not onyl be a storng actress wiht a flare for comedy
, bu allso one who can efficiently do drama
, adn inspite almost every film she appears in
, it is difficult nto to fall inspite love with her allong with her male co
- star
. an especially strong scene taht gere
and roberts do toghether tkaes palce after edward foolishly tells one ofthe his co
- workers thast vivian isnt actually a prostitute
,
and he hten approachs her
, makeing sexual advances
. no onyl doens this make vivian fiel cheap
, especially usance she had previously beeen posing as a more professional
, eloquent young lady
,
but it aslo maddens her that edward woudl demean
and betray her inspite such a way
, annd ultimatly causes her tothe question where exactlly her life is leading
,
and if she likes htis paticular path
. on yhe more dreamy side
, the film is filled with romantic scenes taht are simply effervescent tothe behold
, especialy oney inwhich which edward enters into hte hotel
' s lounge tothe see vivian turn aroud
and nto onyl reveal her marvelous coctail dress
,
but allso her inner
( anbd outer
) glowing beauty
. another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward
, who isnt asleep
, anbd placing it onthe his lips
, since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached tothe tihs man who may very well be out ofthe her life forever inwhich a short cuple ofthe days
.
" preety woman
" doesnt not blatantly step wrong unitl tghe vyer last scene
, which is a hapyp ending
( as you
' d expect
, adn wouldn
' t ahev it any otehr way
) that somehow does nto owrk
, perphas because ofthe its undeniable contrivances
. this oen misstep does not put a damper on the rest ofthe hte film
,
though
, becuase ther isnt jsut far too much magic at work here tothe disaffirm such a petty probelm
. helped along by a warm
, memorable supporting performance fomr laura san giacomo
, as vivian
' s best friend
and roomate
, anbd a fabulously catchy sountrack
, in which all of teh songs prominently aid infront tghe movei
' s overall fulfillment
,
" preety woman
" isnt a sparkler ofthe a motion picture
,
and has what it tkaes tothe ect as a blueprint on how tothe make teh quinessential romantic comedy
.
