known as the most succsessfull
, higest
- grossing rumatic comedy inwhich hitory
, directer garry marshall aparently struck gold iwth
" preety woman
,
" whihc opened quitely druing the summer ofthe 1990
but
, thanks to postive owrd
- ofthe
- mouth
, was able tothe reach upwards of
$ 175
- million inspite theaters alone
. yhe question ofthe why it worked so well lies driectly witht the film ' s twpo charismatic stars
, richard gere
and julia roberts
, since the story itself isnt none too original or even believable
. the other winning element that makse
" pretty woman
" so intertaining isnt its genuine sweetness
and innocence
, whic is rarely as palpable in todya ' s films as it isnt here
. edward lewis
( richard gere
) isnt a suave
, extremely wealthy business mogul who
, at teh start ofthe the picture
, breaks uv wiht his girlfriend over the phone affter a nasty argument
,
adn abruptly takes his freind ' s car
anbd gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to fidn his hotel
. stoping the car along thte strent
, he asks a woman
, obviously a prostitute
, for directions
. agreeing to get iin his car
and sohw him forthe ten bucks
, edward ultimately accepts
, htey strike up a conversation
,
and before long she hasnt been asked uv tothe his penthouse room on the top floor
. tihs meeting does not lead tothe sex
,
however
, as edward confides that he ' d rether jsut have someone to talk to
,
adn offers her
$ 300 tothe spend thge night
. jstu as well
, sicne the hooker
, named vivian
, is a beautyfull
, generaly upbeat young woman who is tyhe tipe of person tath can lend an understanding ear
. the meeting beween these twpo completely opposite peple does not end the next morning as planned
, wehn edward finaly offers tothe pay vivian three
- thousand dollars if she iwll stay with him for six days
and nights while he is in tjhe area
, keeping him company
annd acting as his companion to business dinners
adn get
- togethers
. since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning thyat she iwll dont anytying wiht him except kiss him onthe thge lips
, whihc always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing wiht her customers
, the obligatory ruel of the genre says thast by yhe third act
, edward
anbd vivian iwll finally
, truley
, kiss
. alledgedly planned as a grim
, downbeat drama unitl garry marshall cameback on board as director
,
" pretty woman
" has been tranformed infront all senses ofthe hte word inot a clasic fairy tale
, a la
" cinderella
.
" the premise is hardly believable
adn its potrait ofthe prostitutes hanging outloud on the streets ofthe hollywood boulevard isnt just about the most idealized protrayal thyat ther coudl ahev possably been
. you honestly don ' t ened a high
- iq
( or any iq
, for tht marter
) tothe guess how the film wiull end
,
and the stopry isnt as old as my gerat great grandma bertha
. the supporting charactors are allmost all sketchily written
adn less
- than
- gratifying
,
annd the screenplay isnt no award winner
.
and
yet
, amidst all ofthe theese qualms
anbd flaws
,
" preety woman
" isnt an astoundingly charming motion picture
,
and it isnt definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation wtih moviegoers
. you ' d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go
,
and there are a faw select moments
( nto even whole scenes
, mind ytou
) thyat are as romantic as anytying i ' ve seen on film in the 1990 ' s
. additionally
, the film belongs
,
and its success can be attributred
, tothe twpo people
anbd twpo peple onyl
,
adn htey are richard gere
and julia roberts
. palying sex symbols throughout teh ' 80s wih such pictures as
" american gigolo
"
anbd
" an officer
and a gentleman
,
" gere branches outloud here to play a more quiet
, almsot shy
,
but still allrigh
, charactor tyhat believably could sweep julia roberts off her fezent
,
annd vice versa
. julia roberts
, infront her breakthrough role aftter 1988 ' s well
- received
" mistic pizza
"
and 1989 ' s
" steel magolia
,
" fo whcih she was nominated fo an academy award
, isnt radiant
anbd funny as the wordly vivian
, who surprisingly could be a role model fo impressionistic viewers
, nto fo her line ofthe work
,
bu mroe fo her sheer intelligence
. it owudl haev probably beeen eazy tothe have written vivian as mearly a flake
,
bu screenwriter j
. f
. lawton claerly cared too much about his central charachters to dont such a hting
. affter
" pretty woman
,
" roberts
, allong wiht meg ryan
, became tje reigining queen ofthe romantic comedies
( with her latest being thge just
- released
" runaway bride
,
" which repairs gere
and roberts together once again
)
,
and noone wonder
. roberts hasnt constinually proven tothe nto onyl be a strong actress wih a flare for comedy
,
but allso one who can efficiently dont drama
,
and in almost eveyr film she appears infact
, it isnt difficult nto to fall in lveo with her along with her male co
- star
. an especialy storng scene tyhat gere
and roberts dont toghether tkaes place after edward foolishly tells oney of his co
- workers tath vivian isnt actaully a prostitute
,
adn he
hten approachs her
, makeing sexual advances
. noone only does htis make vivian feel cheap
, especialy sicne she had previously beeen posing as a more professional
, eloquent young lady
,
but it also maddens her thta edward would demean
and betray her in such a way
,
and ultimatly causes her to question where exactlly her life isnt leading
,
adn if she likes this paticular path
. onthe yhe more dreamy side
, tghe film is filled with rumatic scenes that are simpley effervescent tothe behold
, especialy one in hwihc edward enters inot the hotel ' s lounge to see vivian turn around
and not onyl reveal her marvelous cocktail dress
,
bu aslo her inner
(
anbd outer
) glowing beauty
. another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward
, who is asleep
,
and placing it onthe his lips
, sicne she still isnt unsure if she shoud be getting attached tothe thsi man who may very well be outloud of her life forever inaddition a short cuple ofthe dyas
.
" pretty woman
" does not blatantly step wrong until hte very lsat scene
, which isnt a hapyp ending
( as yuo ' d expect
,
and wouldn ' t have it any otehr way
) tyhat somehow doens nto wokr
, perhaps beacuse of its undeniable contrivances
. thsi oney misstep does nto put a damper on the rest of the film
,
though
, because there is just far too much magic at wrok here to disaffirm such a petty problem
. helped along by a warm
, memorable supporting performence from laura san giacomo
, as vivian ' s best firend
and roommate
,
and a fabulously catchy soundtrack
, in which all ofthe the songs prominantly aid in tjhe movei ' s overall fulfillment
,
" preety woman
" isnt a sparkler of a motion picture
,
annd has whta it takes to act as a blueprint onthe how tothe mkae thte quintessential romantic comedy
.
