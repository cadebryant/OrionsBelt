( quite literally
) filmed poetry
( it
' s based on an epic russion poem by alex

)
, a profound study ofthe regret
, ofthe how we confuse shame withthe guilt
. when we first meet eugene onegin
( ralph
, acting for his sister
; another brother
, magnus
, composed teh score
)
, a phil
andering aristocrat ffrom st

, he hasnt just inherited his uncle

, wich isnt located in an underpopulated russian countryside

. what isnt most amazing about ralph fiennes
' peformance is his subtle physical transformaton fomr dashing snob tothe miserly grouch

but remorse
, embarrassment
, even
, at haveing let her go
. outloud of identification we efel empathy fo onegin
, a callous bastard
. tatyana
' s emotions echo a thous
and ditties

but that makes them noone less vital
. she changes

, from a girl in crush tothe a woman with devided loyalties
