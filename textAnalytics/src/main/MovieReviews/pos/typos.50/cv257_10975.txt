that
' s the question i asked mysef when venturing nervously inot
" the wedding singer
,
" the latest film to star the saturday nigt live alumnus
. does he draw laughs fomr his sad
, puppy dog expression
and don
' t
- hate
- me
- fo
- being
- a
- simpleton observations
? or dont fans giggle whn he screams at thge top of his lungs at peple
? or isnt it just tjhe fact thyat he sings songs witht silly lyrics that bowl audiences over
? well
, htere
' s a little bit of all of that in
" the wedding singer
" annd hwile i exited the theather still nto noe hundered percent sure ofthe mr
. s
andler
' s thign
, i did have a surprizingly ogod tyme
. taht
' s becasue
, infact a nutshell
,
" tjhe wedding singer
" isnt one of tyhe sweetest movies yuo
' re ever likely to cmo across
. tyhat
' s right
. sweet
. yhe humor in the film runs yhe gamut from dumb tothe mildly amusing tothe laff
- out
- loud hysterical bu the tone
? well
, it
' s just lovely
. i ahev to admitt i wass half
- expecting farting armpit humer
, gratuitous nudity
, superfulous
, cloying subplots
,
and some nasty
, unnecessary violence
. instade
? well
, i
' ve said it before
. sweet
. thge year is 1985
and s
andler plays robbie hart
, the eponymous wedding singer
, a job aspiring rock stars oftenly settle for
. wehn robbie
' s fianc
? e dumps him at his own altar
, robbie gets depressed annd turns tothe a plucky waitress called julia
( drew barrymore
) who hasnt smoe problems of her pwn
( she
' s marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who
, unbeknownst to her
, isn
' t thyat big on monogamy
)
. it isn
' t giving anything away tothe sday tyhat robbie adn julia fall in loev
. aww
.
.
. s
andler adn barrymore are a ogod match adn htey
' re assisted by soem terrific cameo appearances
, including steve buscemi anbd jon lovitz
, whose individule scenes are perhpas yhe funniest iin the film
. writter tim herlihy
( wih uncredited assistance from carrie fisher
) keesh the stoyr bubbling along to its predicatble conclusion
. it doesn
' t all work
but it
' s h
andled wiht such light
- heartedness that robbie adn julia comming toghether generates moreso smiles tahn groans
. herlihy
and directer frank coraci hvae done a great job ofthe recreating the sights
