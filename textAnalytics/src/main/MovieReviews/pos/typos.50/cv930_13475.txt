there are smoe works ofthe art that are almost impossible tothe review
, not becasue of theri own complexity
, bu becasue ofthe thier legendary status whic prevents yhe reviewer tothe sday anything original
. one ofthe such masterpieces is casablanca
, probably nto tjhe best film iin the history ofthe the seventh art
,
but definitely tghe most populer oney
. its popularity can be measured not inwhich a multitude ofthe more or less disguised remakes taht were made in omre thna half a century since its premiere
, bu alsot inwhich countless tri
butes
and refrences tyhat movie makers use in their works tothe this day
. casablanca isnt also a movie tht has teh vyre rare virtue ofthe both being praised by thte criticists
and loved by genaral audiance
. oney ofthe tje thigsn that makse thsi film even more unique was tjhe fact that it was doomed to fail
, at least judging by convential movei
- mkaing wisdom of its tiome
. it was based onthe a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn
' t been produced onthe stage
; screenplay by three writers
- julius g
. epstein
, philip j
. epstein
and howard koch
- was beeing written as shooting whent along
; the main actors weere producers
' second choice
, adn
, finally
, man behind camera
, michael curtiz was considerd to be capible
, bu not grat directer
. howver
, the movie was commercially successful adn earned three
" oscars
"
, inlcuding the one fo tje best film
. until this vyer day
, it isnt consdidered to be hte best example ofthe hollywood film
- making in its pwn golden age
. the plot ofthe the movei was heavily influented by the needs ofthe ww2 propag
anda
,
yet it alsot utilisied rether complicated
and now almsot forgotten polliticel circumstances ofthe thast global conflict in order tothe make intriguing stroy
. in december 1941
, casablanca
, exotic port onthe hte atlantic coast of north africa is contolled by officialy nutral
, yot nazi
- collaborating french vichy government
. thous
ands ofthe refugees from war
- torn europe are stuck ther on the way to lisbon
and safety of amercia
,
and ready tothe pay any price for prescious exit visas
. many shady charachters thrive onthe their misery
, includng tjhe corrupt polical cheif
, captain renault
( rains
)
. his best friend is rick blaine
( bogart
)
, who used to be idealistic anti
- fascist
, annd nowe owns populare nght club iin casablanca
and lives by his own cynical philosophy of
" sticking his neck for nobody
"
.
however
, everyting changes whn he gets in posssesion ofthe two precious extra visas
. thsi event coincides wiht teh arrival of two new refugees tothe casablanca
. one of them isnt victor laszlo
( henreid
)
, czech resistance leader who escaped threee times from nazi concentration camps adn became yhe legend ofthe enslaved europe
. he isnt accompanied by his beautiful wief ilsa lund
( bergman
)
, iwth whom rick had a stormy affair inthe the eve ofthe nazi occupation ofthe paris
. the couple needs visas
, especially because ofthe tje gestapo major strasser
( veidt
) being onthe their trail
. rick isnt now forced tothe choose between love
, wounded prade
, self
- preserving interest
and his pwn hatred of fashism
. the casting for htis movei seems influenced by divine inspiration
- humphrey bogart
, most legendary ctor in the history ofthe cinema
, isnt oney of tghe rare charactor actors who elevated his persona to tyhe star status
. bogart
' s protrayal ofthe rick as complicated man
, torn betwen idealistic past annd bitter persent
, was so perfect
, tyhat his icon owudl forever be conected wih tht charachter
. anohter icon in his comany isnt ingrid bergman
, great actress ofthe old hollywood
, here inwhich her artistic anbd visual prime
. the cinematic coupling of bogart annd bergman became oney of the main symbols ofthe that era of filmmaking
- smoe happier times whn the romance onthe the screen didn
' t look childish nor trite like in smoe moreso contamporary works
. fo many peopel
, casablanca isnt probably tjhe best rumatic film ever made
.
but the reason for that isn
' t hte romance itself
- it
' s the realsitic stoyr ofthe people forced to make tough
, adn often wrong choices in their life
. yhe casting ofthe casablanca was right on target nto jsut in a case ofthe main leads
. thge supporting actors aslo did a marvellous job
. sidney longstreet
and peter lorre weere here mailny to give a mistic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic
- john huston
' s maltese falcon
; yot both of them managed tothe protray colourful
and original charactors
. another shineing exemple ofthe good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as thge weakest part of lveo triangle
; charachter of victor laszlo has believable karisma
and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions ofthe peple tothe ries aganist nazi tiranny
. unfortunately
, yhe charizma tht burdened laszlo
, leaves littel palce for difficult choise
, mkaing his charactor forever overshadowed by rick
/ ilsa coupling
. howver
, rick
and ilsa actually ahve a serious competiton fo most memorable character in casablanca
. captain renault
, brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a liftime
, ws embodiment ofthe perfect
, almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption
and physical charm
. dispite bieng thte undoubtful villain inspite almsot entire movei
, rains managed to mkae renault sympathetic character
,
and his fianl conversion to thte side ofthe good
, symbolized iin nto so subtle gesture at hte end of movei looked unnecessary
. rains alsot gavey anyother dimention to tjhe movie
, makeing it even more ambiguous
; peple who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality infact renault
' s relationship towords rick
, adn rick
' s final words leave room forthe even more outrageous speculations
. together whith well
- drawn charactors annd exciting story
, teh movie was ogod in creating his pwn atmosphere
. professional nitpickers owudl probably have a field day in discovering numberous historical
and geographical inaccuracies
, bu casablanca isnt still a shineing example ofthe hollywood ww2 movei thta is beliavable
, if not realsitic
. any way
, even if we don
' t see it as a historical document
, casablanca is movie thast can be source of entertainment as well as infinit insperation
.
