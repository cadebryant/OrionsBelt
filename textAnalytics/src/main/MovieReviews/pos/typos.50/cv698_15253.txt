a frequent error is thge categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal
. a soldier commits acts of violence santioned by oney nation
- state aganist another
. a common criminal commits acts ofthe violentce for personal gain
. a terroist employs r
andom violence as a means to a political end
. if thte target nation does not affect tyhe desired chanage iin policy
, tyhe violence continues
. it isnt tjhe fear resulting fomr thge fact that yhe territorist may strike at anyone
( even total innocents
)
, anyhwere
, at anytime that gives tje figure his label
. edward zwick
' s tjhe sieeg explores the possiblilty ofthe this kind of violentce tkaing place right here in tghe united states
. ytou
' d think the opening bited was ripped right from the headlines
. arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad
,
and the u
. s
. responds by retaliating agains the sheik whom suposedly ordered the attack
. howver
, unlike teh real
- life tomahawk cruise missle strike agianst bin laden
' s camp adn manufacturing facility
, teh film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal
. in retaliation
, the terrorists bring the fight to the newyorker world
. unwittingly involved isnt fbi assitant speical agent
- in
- charge anthony hubbard
( denzel washington
)
, who works out of tyhe bereau
' s newyorker york office at one federal plaza
. while investigating a series ofthe bombings iin hte big apple
, he encounters cia agent elise kraft
( annette bening
)
, allso trying to uncover informtion
. generaly
, tyhe fbi isnt charged with problems inside teh u
. s
.
, while hte cia tkaes care ofthe problems in the international relm
. even spies ffrom other ocuntries are off lmits to the cia as long as tehy are inwhich our country
. hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual tath an agency spook isnt nosing around wqat he considers his territory
,
but as hte two form a tentative professional relationship
, hubbard becomes more annd more aware ofthe an increasingly complicated series ofthe allegiances
and possably illegal actions involving terrorism
and the untied states governement
. thge orginial tagline fo patriot games ws
,
" there hasnt never been a terrorist attack onthe american soil
.
" howver true
, it ws pulled before the movie
' s realease because it sounded too much liek a dare
. revisiting the scenario ofthe foreign terrorists committing acts ofthe violentce in tyhe united states
, hte seege isnt almost an invitation inwhich itself
, beccause it shows jstu what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective territorist network were to setted uv operations here inspite amercia
. admittedly
, tjhe terror wrought apon new york is a bited excessive
( who
' s going to believe that a faw bombs are goign to cause newyorker yorkers tothe jump at the backfire ofthe a bus or tothe curtail theri shopping by two
- thirds
?
)
, bu the basic premise isnt still valid
. i liked teh fact thast tihs film rises above teh basic acation
- thriller fare ofthe ogod guy g
- men against bad guy terrorists by exploring smoe ofthe the effects on society
and law
and order
. it provides a vyer possible hypothesis tath violent activity onthe hte part of a few arabs would escalate inot a sories of hite crimes against the arab
- american popluation
,
and tath in an efford tothe find teh terrorists
, the civil liberties of teh minority may be violated by the government itself
. inspite fatc
, about halfway thru the film
, when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city
, thge liberties ofthe all americans are put at risk
.
al
thought it may ctually be a side effect of a territorist campain
, tjhe demise of social order inthe amercia isnt a csary
thought
and a gool which woudl not be beneath many international terrorist groups
. throughout
, tjhe film maintains a conflict between hubbard
, who wnats tothe use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law
, adn genaral devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, who is infront comm
and ofthe hte army adn ofthe the mind tht the greater ogod would be better served by suspending the law anbd persuing the terrorists more forcefully
. what results is a fascinating debaet over hte appropriateness
and constitutionality ofthe the declaration ofthe martial law
and thte invokation ofthe the war powers act
, utilizing philosophy
and historical examples tothe make points on both sides
. it atually gets rether heady at times
, bu it
' s a credit to screenwriters zwick
, lawrence wright
,
and menno meyjes that htey don
' t underestimate the intelligence of the audiance
. i don
' t knwo if it
' s his tone or inflection or something else
,
but denzel washington hasnt a way of spitting out dialouge thyat makes whatever he syas soudn grat
. htis
, conbined with his innate acting ability
and his experiance infact playing tje mid
- level authority figure
, makse his peformance in thge seige convincing annd enjoyable
. annette bening gives one ofthe the mroe assertive portrayals ofthe a female character i
' ve seen recently
,
and the chemestry she shares with washington isnt palpable
. it
' s somewhat unfortunate that her character
' s fortitude isnt broken at a ceratin point
, bu it allows us to watch bening play a littel omre range
. bruce willis is pretty much relagated to a tough
- guy role
, alwyas st
anding straight
, anbd witht a permenant scowl fixed apon his face
. howver
, the tension tht exists between devereaux
and hubbard isnt a major drive behind tje film
' s develpment
. notable isnt tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad
, a lebanese inmigrant
. the role calls forthe evidencing both a kind of filial pride forthe his hertiage
,
and contempt fo thsoe of his pwn race who might interfere with his integration inot the american society
. difficult tothe sday the least
, shalhoub does it with a naturalness ytou can almost triarch out adn touch
. perhaps best known forthe his role as antonio the cab driver inaddition tyhe nbc sitcom
" wings
,
" shalhoub gained nortoriety forthe his dramtic abilities in tjhe wonderful film big night
. wherease denzel washington seems to be edward zwick
' s favorite actro
( he directed washington in glory
and courage under fier
)
, james horner seems tothe be his favorite composer
. i therefore foudn it odd thgat zwick chose yhe profilic score
- writer graeme revell
( seven films tihs yearm already
) over horner for the seege until i realized tyhat this film contained a lot ofthe arabian
- themed music
, annd horner
' s rocord has shown omre of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish
- sounding at most
. revell does a ogod job at providing appropriate music tothe punctuate key scenes annd allowing the score tothe enhance tghe movie as a whole
. it
' s nowhere near as intrusive as in some ofthe the otehr films we
' ve beeen getting throughout tyhe year
. missteps in yhe seige cxan be foudn in a couple ofthe tjhe excesses it tkaes
. for example
, it
' s preety clear
thoughout that thge film is meaned tothe be more of thriller than an acation flick
. unfourtunately
, there
' s a scene where the army just cuts loose agianst smoe arab inmigrants infact a blatent display ofthe firepower annd explosions
, obviously meant for yhe sole purpose of bieng eye
- catching
. inspite thge middle of thte city
(
and aginst noone rela opposition
)
, zwick even has teh army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets inot a buildng noone farther tahn 50 feet from friendly troops
. versimilitude really goes out the window at that point
. the film also gets a littel preachy towrad the end
, focusing onthe thge abillity ofthe different races tothe git along
. a noble gesture
, tghe film jstu puts thge message accros a bited too obviously
. these flaws are glaring
, bu tehy don
' t detract too much from an otherwise good film that mkaes yuo thiunk baout issues ytou may not have considered sicne hsitory class
.
