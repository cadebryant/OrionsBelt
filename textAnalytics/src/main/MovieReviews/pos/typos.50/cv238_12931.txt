" isnt a summer movei tath gets tyhe summer movie experince deliciously right
, a commendable achievement concidering tghe season thus far has been littered wih some preety uneven fare
. here
' s a genuinely funn fluff peice that konws it
' s fluff
, recognizes it
' s fluff anbd is admittedly proud tothe be fluff
. of course
, thge casting ofthe harrison ford in thte broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part inwhich the movie
' s success
; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it
' s eazy tothe forget whta a funny guy he cin be
. as his female counterpart
, anne heche alsot deserves a big pat on the back fo her sweet
, goofily charasmatic performance
. yhe age difference
( ford
' s 56
, heche
' s 29
) matters nto
-
- these twpo click iin a charged way that
' s hard to come by
. tjhe stopry is a noone
- brainer

- ford stars as gruff bu loveable isl
and avyator quinn harris
, hwile heche is career
- minded
but loveable newyorker york magasine editor robin monroe

and tehy immediately fidn themselfs stuck iin a deserted paradime with faw ideas onthe getting bakc tothe civilization
. a series of unplesant
, often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choise bu for both munbers of thsi unlikey odd couple tothe fall for earch otehr
. meanwhile
, bakc at the resort
, frank isnt tempted himself by quinn
' s shapely female tagalong
( jacqueline obradors
)
. that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn
- robin pairing
,
and hwile it mkaes forthe a fewd good laughs early onthe
, it evenhtually becomes a contrived distraction from thte far more engrossing misadventures ofthe quinn adn robin
. anbd since tje film spends most ofthe its tiome wtih thte castaways
, this flwa is only a minor inconvenience
. directer ivan reitman keesh the pace brusk

,
and
though it essentially boils down to oen mishap after anyother
, tehy
' re all quite engaging
