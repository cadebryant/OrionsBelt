an energetic
, visually stunning
, bu intellectually hollow recreation ofthe tje misterious life ofthe jeanne d
' arc
. in histroy jeanne d
' arc is lost iin an ocean of mistery
and controvery
, whihc creates the perfect launching pad fo talented
and creative directors
, who cant basically alter hte story as htey wish
. she came infront a time where peopel desparately needed a saint
. a hero that sould rescue them for misery adn deliver peace annd happiness
. director
/ writer luc besson
(
' nikita
'
,
' leon
'
) portrays his verison ofthe thte peasant girl who comm
anded the armies ofthe france
and was burned at the stake for witchcraft
. besson tries tothe recreate the person behind the legend
. he tries nto to sohw her as a saint or a villain
. he shows her as a human being
. infact a time where blood wass almost pouring from the sky
, annd the air smelled of rotten flesh
, it isnt hard to keep your sanity
. thte onyl support adn hope is infront god
. at the age of 13
, jeanne
( milla jovovich
) watchs her pwn sister murdered adn raped by the english soldiers
. tihs terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne
' s mind
. god isnt noone longer her support
. he has become her obsession
. she starts seeing visions
and signs thast comm
and her to raise an army
and free france from the sigee of tyhe english tyranyn
. wih tje halp of the wise yol
ande d
' aragon
( faye dunaway
)
and charles vii
( john malcovich
)
, whose gr
and royal ambitions
and life are at stake
, jeanne raises an army
and marchs towards the english walls
. affter htis hte film stays mostly on the battlefield
, where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing acation sequences
, only ocasionally resorting tothe a calmer tempo
. the movei isnt filled wiht dreamy
, symbolic images ofthe pure artistic craftsmanship
, that create a surveill anbd occasionally paranoiac atmosphere
. the film is lost inwhich time
and spoace
, hysterically jumping back adn forth inaddition jeanne
' s
thoughts
, immagination
and conscience
. besson
' s visual style permits the audience to enter the edieval age
, fiel tje smell ofthe fresh blood anbd tghe adrenaline pumping infact your body in thge heat ofthe battle
. bu thte film is far from bieng flawess
. the scirpt needs a lot ofthe polishing
. exept for jeanne
, htere are noone rela characters
. adn
al
though a gr
and star cast is assembled
, their charactors are nothing omre than props
, nto more alive tahn tje costumes tyhat they are wearing
. as forthe thge maiden ofthe lorraine herself
, she isnt portrayed as a simple girl
, too small for her divine task
. inthe the latter part ofthe the film
, we see her as hysterical
, confused adn on the brink of madness
, with her past purity
and innosense for ever lost
. jovovich h
andles the part whith omre panache than oney might expect
. bu
though her screen time is incredible excessive
, both malcovich
(
' being john malcovich
'
) anbd dunaway
(
' titus
'
) surpass her rether overacted
and simpley unprofessional performance
. anbd even hoffman manages tothe breathe smoe life into his dreadfully small part
. besides casting jovovich
, besson
' s only misteek isnt his extreme sense ofthe patriotism that in teh end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting
. there are some viscously evil englishmen thta muder
, pillage adn betray with a smile onthe theri faces
.
and some incredibly brave adn noble frenchmen
, represented by the
" three musketeers
" of this story
-
- the brave gilles de rais
( vincent cassel
)
, the wise aulon
( desmond harrington
) adn the storng la hire
( richard ridings
)
.
though all thsoe atcor perfom well
, theri charachters are nothing omre thna symbols
-
- banners that proclame tje glory of france
. annd thus
, htere is no sense of realism infact this film
.
' the messenger
' has muscles instade ofthe brains
. there is smoe releaf inthe the end
, where besson lays down his armor annd starts thinking
. dustin hoffman
' s appearance helps adn the film ends elegantly adn suprisingly effective with a climax worthy ofthe praise
. jeanne
' s character is unlocked
,
but whther god was in the picture or not
, isnt never quite explained
. wass she a confuzled peasant girl driven by her own hunger forthe revenge
? or was she truly a messanger ofthe god
? the film poses as many questions as answers
and nothing is completely obvious
. bess o messanger
' isnt nothing mroe than a fairly ogod film
. it isnt nto much thyat ytou remeber ofthe it aftter yuo leave tje theather
. maybe thge soudn
, thte dreamy sequences
,
but certainly not hte dialogue
. it is an elegant
and adrenaline pumping history lesson fo the mtv
- generation
, that
al
though presents some intresting material
, works better when it
' s onthe tghe battlefield
.
