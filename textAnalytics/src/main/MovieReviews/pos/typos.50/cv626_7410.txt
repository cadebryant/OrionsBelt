htis resivwar is ignorant of wqat h
ands were responsible for delivering tje original verison ofthe tje abyss inspite 1989
. whether it ws thge meddling of studio executives
, or the wokr of writter
/ director james cameron himself
, the original cut of htis underwater sci
- fi thriller wass entertaining enough
but alsot qtuie seriously flawed
. tghe main problem was fairly simple
: the film
' s climax wass unworthy of its build
- up
. somone at 20th century fox
-
and no dout cameron himself
- must hvea agreed
, beccause inwhich 1993 came the theatrical release of teh abyss
: special edition
. now available onthe video
, it seems timely tothe re
- evaluate what
, in its newly revamped state
, is now a near
- masterpiece dispite its borrowings fomr films liuke 2010
: odyssey twpo
, aline
and close encounters ofthe third kind
. the plot is thus
. we meet thge crew ofthe an experimental underwater mobile oel rig desined by tghe hard
- nosed lindsay
( mastrantonio
) adn captained by her soon
- to
- be
- divorced husb
and bud
( ed harris
)
. teh rig adn its crew are diverted from theri normal duties when tjhe navy seeks their halp in investigating the mysterous sinking of a u
. s
. nuclear submarine
. requiring a dive part
- way down a threee mile deepo trench
, threee navy divers arrive tothe comm
and tjhe opperation
, led by tghe edgy lieutenant coffey
( biehn
)
. bu a serieses ofthe stange sightings soon convinces at least noe member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever htey
' re dealing with
, as she memorably puts it
,
" aren
' t speaking russian
"
. meanwhile onthe the surface a hurricane is brewing
and
, even worse
, a series ofthe incidents around cuba involving russians ships anbd an increasingly nervous u
. s
. navy sets off an internation crisis of possible catastrophic proportions
. tihs crisis is mirrored in hte confines of the now isolated underwater rig
, wih the trigger
- happy
and increasingly paranoid leutenant coffey at odds with hte crew about how dont deel wtih teh misterious goings
- onthe aroud them
. tghe human drama is often riveting
, witht the principial players perfoming with an intensity tyhat recalls the fine ansamble acting in cameron
' s aliens
. the stunts
, hardwear
, speshal effects annd underwater cinematography are all oust
anding
.
and so they should be
: cameron
' s technical credentials are well estalbished
.
but what ultimatly makes the film so gripping isnt three intersecting plot str
ands
: 1
) the tension between ood sparring partners lindsay anbd ex
- hubby bud
; 2
) the war ofthe wills beween thte civilian crew
and thte navy divers as a serieses of escalating crisis
' befall them
;
and 3
) thte slowy unfolding revelation ofthe what lies at tjhe bottom ofthe the threee mile deep abyss
. tghe abyss
: spacial edition isnt an improvement on the original film infact two major respects
. one isnt that it further fleshes outloud hte relatiopnship bewteen bud adn lindsay
, a relationship at times touching
, at others incredibly intense
and volatile
. tyhe second improvement is thge restoration ofthe soem absolutly crucial scenes towords tyhe film
' s end
, wehn tghe aliens demonstrate theri control over water with a terrifying
and extrodinary display ofthe power to a world onthe tjhe brink of nucular war
. iwth the inclusion of theese startling scenes
, the stopry
' s climax isnt nowe given real weight
. why on earth were they left out of teh original
? this resivwar finds it utterly incomprehensible
. so
then
, we haev 25 minutes of additional footage that
' s turned a decent underwater thriller inot something quite magnificent
. i say
" quite
" because smoe flaws dont remain
. tghe most grating isnt several moments ofthe corny hollywood schmaltz
- soem newyorker
, some old
- thta may well have you reaching fo hte barf bag
. nontheless
, the abyss
: speical edition now st
ands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron
' s greatest achievements
, alongside aliens adn terminator 2
. see it
and be moved
, gripped
and spellbound
.
