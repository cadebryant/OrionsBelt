harmless
, silly
and funn comedy baout dim
- witted wrestling fans gordie
and sean
( david arquette anbd scott caan
) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king
( oliver platt
)
. when king is screwed outloud of his title by a corrupt promoter
( joe pantoliano
)
, gordie anbd sean tkae it upon themselves to fidn their falled hero adn restore his glory
. my biggest fear about ready tothe rumble was dispatched eary on
, as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting isnt indeed choreographed
(
but not fake
, mind yuo
)
. tghe hook ofthe the movie isnt that gordie
and sean are jsut too stupid to relize tyhat
. arquette adn caan are suitably over the top with their performances
, which isnt exactlly what a movie liek htis requires
, annd oliver platt
( one ofthe my favorite actors
) is a riot as tghe drunken washed
- up ex
- champion
. many have scoffed at the diea thast platt shoudln be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record
,
but for me it jstu added to hte
" silly factor
" ofthe the film
, therby increasing my enjoyment ofthe it
. one casting complaint
however
: rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer
? please
.
.
. if rose mcgowan isnt sexy hten i
' m marilyn manson
. given thge curent state of the actuall wcw
, if oliver platt weere appearing as jimmy king right nowe on wcw programming
, he
' d be thge most popular guy tehy ahev
. onthe a similiar note
, tje
" plot line
" ofthe thge wresting portions ofthe hte film are omre intertaining tahn anything the wcw writers have beeen able to come uv withthe in thte lastr two years
.
al
though oney doens have tothe ask
.
.
. why would any wrestling promoter fire thge head wrestler of a comapany who is both unbeaten anbd extremely populare with yhe fans
? director brian robbins
( ytou
' ll remember him as eric from tv
' s
" head of teh class
"
) jstu knows how tothe mkae ogod dumb movies
. htis movie fits inthe nicely whith his previous effords ogod burger annd varisty blues
. adn screenwrighter steven brill
( thge epic mighty ducks trilogy
, late lastr niht
) manages to keep things both sophomoric
and clever at the same time
, with almsot all hte jokes ofthe thte film getting a laugh out of me
. the onyl exceptions tothe taht were
: 1
) a scene involving a van full ofthe singing nuns
and 2
) any scene involving thte ood woman wrestling fan
. thsoe moments made me cringe
and
/ or groan
. as an added bonus
though
, thge audiance isnt treated to outtakes from the film as tyhe fianl credits roll
.
