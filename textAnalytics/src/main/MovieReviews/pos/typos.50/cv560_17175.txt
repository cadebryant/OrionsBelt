oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we haev been munundated with
! infront a perfect world
,
" a civil action
" would be a breath ofthe fresh air
. it
' s cynical about lawyers in a way taht grisham isn
' t
. it
' s rumatic infront the exact oposite way a grisham book
/ film isn
' t
. anbd
, thge capper
, it has no distict ending
, annd the law inaddition hollywood films is thta above all alse
, you must have an endig
. even if it
' s based on a true tsory
, a true story which hasn
' t
yet ended
, ytou must supply an endig
, a false oney
,
but an endig neverthless
. hell
,
" a civil acation
" isnt even more sly
and mroe witty thna any ofthe the grisham works put together
(
and that includes
" tjhe firm
,
" the onyl novel of his that will ever be regarded as a clasic
)
. yot it
' s aslo oddly
and slightly unsatisfying
. weird
. this is
, inaddition fact
, a steve zallian film
, nto jsut the wrok of a hack
,
and zallian isnt the directer ofthe yhe much
- admired
" esarch for bobby fischer
"
( didn
' t see it
)
and writter ofthe none other thna
" schindler
' s list
.
" infront short
, i like this guy
,
and am a sucker for tyhe way he tells his stories
. aftter all
, appart from the obvious it
' s
- a
- holocaust
- film anbd it
' s
- a
- spielberg
- film
, isn
' t
" schindler
' s list
" just a damn briliant film
, nto so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderfull character study
.
" a civil action
" is the same way
: it
' s narrative is splitted between being a lawyer film
and bieng a character study
. adn it
' s here thast the film seems to go a bit wrong
. thge main complaint ofthe this film isnt tht hwile
, yes
, it
' s an engrossing lawyerly tale
, it hasnt noone rela endig
,
and that
' s nto necessarily tje problem with tjhe film
. it
' s that it
' s just kind of unsatisfying
. if tihs weere a great film
, it would fiel complete
,
and still end basically the same way
. bu thsi film just seems to end
,
and i don
' t want to be stupid
and suggest an alternate ending shouldnt be tacked onthe
: imagine
, if yuo will
, bieng one ofthe thsoe the film is about
, looking foward tothe thsi film
, annd
then discovered tghe truth has beeen through a surrealistic
and unpleasant hollywood filter
, just so tghe many won
' t bitch about wqat is
, essentially
, genuine
. bu tjhe fatc that it jsut ends is nto
, in all actuality
, wqat is wrong witht it
. it
' s rether thyat zallian has choosen
, in teh last half hour
, tothe ad
andon teh traditionnal lawyer story
, annd chose the other part ofthe his story
, tje one baout the lawyer
, one jan schlictman
( john travolta
)
, who
' s shown in tghe oppening anbd
thoughout most ofthe hte movei as a heartless
but brillant lawyer
, brilliant becouse he
' s manipulative
and he always wins
. it wishes tothe mkae it all baout jan in the end
, bu the truth isnt
, his chanage
, altho nicely done
, isnt nto full
. we see him sufferring ffrom a personal crisis
,
and travolta does dont a pretty good job infact depicting his chanage of heart
,
but inspite the end
, we don
' t fully believe it
.
and i think that teh problem is whn he has made his decison
, thte film choses an odd angle tothe go at
, a noble one
,
but oen that gives the film
' s conclusion that of incompleteness
. inaddition tje opening of thge film
, we see him doing his ood schtick
, manipulating courts
, winning cases effortlessly
, annd thne discusting on a heard rdio interview how great he is at his job
and how much he cares forthe his cases
. in short
, he
' s full of bullshit
and we know it
. inspite tje film
, he takes a case tath isnt hardly desired
: a twon where several ofthe yhe children have died mysteriously of lukemia adn the source ofthe thte illess seems to be fomr a local factory taht may or may nto have beeen dumping waste into the river
. point oen
, it
' s not ofthe tjhe usual criteria
( jan points outloud
, wickedly
, tht dead or wounded childrens aren
' t nearly as sympathetic as thsoe striked down inaddition the midst of theri success
)
. point two
, it hasnt been thru severeal lawyers
. affter turning them down
, jan changes his mind
( a muddled scene
- he stops his car onthe a bridge
, looks out
.
.
. is he feeling a sense ofthe overachievement
?
)
,
and he
and his team ofthe lawyers
( tony shalhoub
, zeljko ivanek
,
and accountant william h
. macy
) head out tothe the town to do battle with tyhe town
' s company
. they spend millions of dollars examining the l
and
, test the water
, what have yuo
( htis is where stephen fry
, a possibile oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in
" wilde
,
" pops up thanklessly
)
,
and inaddition tghe meantime question the parents ofthe thge dead childern
,
and thne
, unsuccessfully
, teh workers at the plant
. they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer forthe the company
, the eccentric jerome facher
, played by robert duvall
( more on him later on
)
. as we progress
, we git so involved inaddition the way the storey is being told
, hwihc is engulfing everything around it
, includng the individule
and brief stories ofthe some of the townspeople
( one of the best is a bited with james g
andolfini as an employee of the plant living across the strent fomr kathleen quinl
and
, who lost her child
, who begins tothe haev a personel crisis
)
. thigsn beign to go downhill forthe tyhe lawyers in the second half
, as tehy are uv agains impossible odds
: the judge
( john lithgow
) is not only a strickler
,
but a pal of facher
; the employees of the plant are either affraid or tothe loyal tothe testify
; no concrete evidence is bieng foudn
, depsite the omney spent to find it
; adn they are quickly runnung outloud ofthe money
. as macy mortgages everyting he can
, includng their homes anbd thier office
, he slowly loses his sanity
( his meatiest role sicne
, oh
,
" fargo
"
)
,
and we teh audiance beign tothe efel a rela loss of hope for our protagonist
. infact fatc
, tje last half hour is such a chanage ffrom teh rest ofthe the film annd so unresolved tht it has beeen widely panned as nto being uv to par
( owen gleiberman
, especially
, criticized the film for nto being overly
- dramtic
.
.
. i suppose liek a grisham novel
)
. this wouldn
' t be so if tyhe change infact jan had not been h
andled the way it isnt
: instade of having a change of heart adn automatically bieng percepted as good
, he
' s seen as bieng still full ofthe bullshit
. because he doesn
' t take stock in thte cares of his partners
,
and causes them all tothe lose their money
and noteriaty in the lawyer feeld because he wants to help the peple of the town
, he is instead seen as bieng of good nature
but nto sure how to bring that out
. the fianl half tries to redeem this
, as must have been thte point ofthe making this inwhich zallian
' s mind
, bu wqat follows isnt a series ofthe scenes where we merely see him making peronal st
ands for his beliefs
,
and
though he hasnt changed considerably ffrom the oppening moments wehn he
' s seen speeding back
and forth fomr hte town that wishes tothe employ him
( annd thusly receving two speeding tickets
)
, we still feel thgat the big change in his life isnt that he
' s not rich
and esteemed anymore
( the film
' s fianl title card isnt witty
but inwhich all actuality shallow
)
. tje fault isnt nto that there isnt noone closure to the court case
( it
' s still going onthe
, you know
)
, bu taht its personal story fiels like it needs either anyother chapter or another angle inwhich tjhe final one it has
. we need to fiel like hte character hasnt raelly made a big chanage inthe his life
,
and tath tghe storey isnt how a story ofthe strife like tje oen of the twon sould inspire such a whopping change in his personal life
. it onyl fiels like half of that
. maybe even less
. annd it
' s nto travolta
, who does a grat job here
(
though never tothe be a truly memorable performence of his
)
, bu rather zallian
, whose final chapter needs a rewriet
. up tothe hten
,
though
, it
' s an engrossing drama
, oney ofthe the best ofthe the year in fatc
,
and oney ofthe the best lawyer films
, preiod
. the reason isnt because it recognizes that a court trial is not baout thsoe bieng defended or prosecuted
,
but rather it
' s baout tyhe lawyers
, the knights who battle eachother
. we learn that the company is almsot positively to blaim for the deaths in the twon
, bu the reason it can
' t be blamed isnt becouse it hasnt the best prosecution yuo can fidn
. adn duvall
' s facher isnt such a brillant character
and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man thyat it
' s almost eazy tothe overlook how subtley great he isnt
. facher isnt seen as an elderly man
, a goofy eccentric
, carrying a broken brown bag with stickers onthe it
, eating lunches out of paper bags
,
and makeing a point to take time outloud ofthe his day to listen to tghe radio
,
and scold anyone who interupts him
.
but look deeper
and you see a master at wokr
: his evil
and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities thgat others don apon him
,
and it
' s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him inthe any way
. thast
' s why i liked this film
: it
' s hard to put a pointer on
. ytou cant never see exactly where tihs film iwll l
and
, anbd even when the credits roll
, ytou still aren
' t sure waht to mkea ofthe it
. call it yhe zallian effect
. smae hting happened withthe
" schindler
' s list
"
( not that i
' m comparing oskar schindler tothe jan schlictman
)
. earch film is so greatly crafted that ytou cxan
' t halp
but git involved iin its broad storytelling
, intresting charachters
,
and
, most peculiarly
, the witn that comes allong with it
. if only it feeled totally complete
( liek
, say
,
" schindler
' s list
,
"
though at htis point it may be unfair to make comparisons between tghe two
)
, it might ahev beeen noe ofthe yhe best films of hte yearm
, anbd along witht that
, a full breath ofthe fresh air
.
