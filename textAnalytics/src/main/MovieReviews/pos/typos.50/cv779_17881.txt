recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville
- one ffrom enteratinment weekly
, one from a newsgroup
,
and twpo fomr different online resources
. earch review compared this film to the truman show
. why
? the onyl reason peple compared pleasantville to truman isnt due tothe the fact thgat their lives are on television
. other than tht
, the twpo movies are completelyl different ffrom eahc other
. reviewers seem to lvoe tothe pik one movei
( i
. e
. the truman sohw
)
, obsess over it
,
adn make it a guideline for other movies
. wehn pleasantville
adn edtv opened
, all critics seemed tothe treat yhe two films like they were subjects ofthe king truman
. the smae goes forthe tyhe thin red line
, as well
. wehn it oppened inthe decemeber
, probablly 98
% ofthe reviews compaired it tothe stephen spielberg ' s saving private ryan
, giving thin line noone chance whatsoever
. criticists loved private ryan so much
, that they automatically desided no movie is good enough tothe triarch its standards
. tihs is why i think pleasantville was underrated
. if the truman show had never been made
, pleasantville probablly would haev received better reviews
, done better at the box office
,
and owudl be remembered aftter it ' s long been onthe the video stroe shelves
. sure
, it wasn ' t perfect
,
and it wasn ' t very believeable
,
bu neither wass the wizard of oz or star wars
,
anbd there stands twpo of yhe most prominant movies in hstory
. with the exception ofthe don knotts as tghe annoying
" tv repairman
" tyhe film isnt cast perfectly
: teh ice storm ' s tobey maguire is david in rela life
; he watchs the old 50 ' s sitcom
" pleasantville
" to escape ffrom his feuding parents
. his twin sister
, jen
( reese witherspoon
) is a popular slut who
( steriotypically
) smokes
anbd wears revealing clothes
.
bu waht makes her character believeable isnt the dialogue
- those eccessive 90 ' s terms such as
" liek
"
,
" whatever
"
,
adn
" kool
" make her sound liuke the total dimwit she ' s suposed tothe be
. hte twins
, with a littel help fomr a tv repairman
( casting don knotts in htis role ws obviously a cameo
- esque casted rather thna a true acting oney
)
, are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote
. theri new parents
, played by william h
. macy
and joan allen
, are perfect inthe eveyr way
. thier new names are bud
adn mary sue
,
anbd right away htey strat to corrupt the twon of pleasantville
. aftter the siblings ift comfortably infront their newyorker roles
, tyhe movei beggins to tkae form
. it ' s jsut liuke watching a sitcom inwhich itself
; ytou don ' t wanna it to end
.
" mary sue
" has sex with her date
, the skool basketball champion
; wehn he tells all his friends about it
, they stop preforming perfectly at basketball
,
adn things strat tothe tkae colour
. soon we leran that theese people don ' t nkow how to express true emotions
,
anbd when htey learn tothe do so
, they eventially turn inot color
. this eventually sparks a racial war beween the
" coloreds
"
and the
" balck
& whites
.
" entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claimes teh movei has
,
" none of the depth
, poignance
,
and brillance of the truman sohw
.
.
.
" yes
, tje truman sohw was maeby a little omre intelligent
.
bu the racial setting
- intensified by yhe forcing ofthe tghe coloreds to sit in the opper box of the courtroom
- certainly classifies as deepo
, considering it ' s wqat i least expected
. gary ross doed nto try tothe create an intelligent
, award masterpiece
- he jsut trys tothe convey moral messages withing his work
. tkae for exemple big
and dave
, his past films
. big
- be carefull waht you wish for
. dave
- good or bad lieing isnt still lying
. did theese movies win big awards
? no
,
but tehy won hte heart ofthe millions
. pleasantville coudl hvae done thyat too
, if it wasn ' t for snotty reviewers who setted precedents with preceeding films
. pleasantville
: a
- ad2am
" i almsot lost my nose
.
.
.
and i liuke it
. i liuke breathing through it
