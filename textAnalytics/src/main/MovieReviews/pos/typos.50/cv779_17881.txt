recently i read 4 reviews ofthe pleasantville
- noe from entertainment weekly
, oney fomr a newsgroup
, annd twpo fomr different online resources
. earch review compaired tihs film tothe the truman sohw
. why
? the only reason people compaired pleasantville to truman is due to tyhe fatc that thier lives are onthe televsion
. otehr tahn thyat
, the twpo movies are completelyl different ffrom eahc otehr
. reviewers seem to love tothe pick oen movei
( i
. e
. the truman sohw
)
, obsess over it
, annd make it a guideline for otehr movies
. wehn pleasantville
and edtv opened
, all critics seemed tothe treat the two films like htey were subjects of king truman
. the same goes for the thin red line
, as well
. when it opened infact decemeber
, probably 98
% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg
' s saving private ryan
, giving thin line noone chance whatsoever
. criticists loved private ryan so much
, that htey automaticly decided noone movei is good anough to triarch its st
andars
. tihs isnt why i htink pleasantville was underrated
. if teh truman sohw hadnt never beeen made
, pleasantville probaly would have received better reviews
, done better at thge box office
,
and would be remembered affter it
' s long been onthe the video stroe shelves
. sure
, it wasn
' t perfect
,
and it wasn
' t very believeable
, bu niether ws the wizard ofthe oz or star wars
, annd there st
ands two of the most prominent movies in history
. witht teh exception of don knotts as tghe annoying
" tv repairman
" the film isnt cast perfectly
: the ice storm
' s tobey maguire isnt david in real life
; he watchs the old 50
' s sitcom
" pleasantville
" to escape fomr his feuding parents
. his twin sister
, jen
( reese witherspoon
) isnt a popular slut who
( steriotypically
) smokes annd wears revealing clothes
.
but wqat makes her character believeable is the dialogue
- those excessive 90
' s terms such as
" like
"
,
" whatever
"
,
and
" cool
" amke her soudn liek tje total dimwit she
' s supposed to be
. the twins
, with a littel help from a tv repairman
( casting don knotts inwhich tihs role wass obviously a cameo
- esque cast rether than a true acting one
)
, are sucked inot pleasantville by a magical new remote
. thier new parents
, palyed by william h
. macy annd joan allen
, are perfect in every way
. thier newyorker names are bud adn mary sue
,
and right awya they strat tothe corrupt tyhe twon ofthe pleasantville
. aftter teh siblings fit comfortably inthe their newyorker roles
, thte movei beggins to tkae form
. it
' s just liek watching a sitcom infront itself
; yuo don
' t whant it to end
.
" mary sue
" has sex wtih her date
, hte school basketball champion
; whn he tells all his friends baout it
, they stop preforming perfectly at basketball
,
and thnigs start to tkae colour
. soon we leran that theese people don
' t knwo how to express true emotions
,
and whn they learn to dont so
, tehy evenhtually turn into colour
. this eventally sparks a racial war between thge
" coloreds
"
and the
" balck
& whites
.
" entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claimes thte movei hasnt
,
" none ofthe the depth
, poignance
, annd brillance ofthe thte truman sohw
.
.
.
" yes
, teh truman show was maybe a littel mroe intelligent
. bu the racial setting
- intensified by the forcing of tyhe coloreds tothe sit in the opper box ofthe hte courtroom
- certainly classifies as deep
, considering it
' s wqat i least expected
. gary ross doed not try tothe create an intteligent
, award masterpiece
- he jsut tries to convey moral messages within his wrok
. tkae for exemple big anbd dave
, his past films
. big
- be carefull wqat yuo wish forthe
. dave
- ogod or bad lying isnt still lying
. doed theese movies win big awards
? noone
, bu htey won tje heart ofthe millions
. pleasantville coudl hvea done thast too
, if it wasn
' t fo snotty reviewers who setted precedents with preceeding films
. pleasantville
: a
- ad2am
" i almost lost my nose
.
