it
' s tough to raelly sday something nice about a type of person who
' s so ethnocentricm thyat any humanity tehy once hadnt isnt nowe gone
,
but by god
,
" american history x
" does it
,
and for taht
, i commend it
. it nto only tkaes balls bu intelligence to make a human bieng out ofthe a neo
- nazi skinhead
, a kind of person who dedicates their lives tothe hating anyone who
' s not what htey are
,
and htis film wisely
and miracurously pulls it off
. the subject of thsi film isnt one of them
, bu he is worse than noe of hte blind followers that mkae up most skinhead munbers sicne he is teh leader of tyhe pack
. he
' s the noe who instigates them tothe take a firm grip onto theri rage
,
and
then in anohter brilliant stroke
, justifies it wih political propog
anda tyhat makes eerie sence when he speaks
. he
' s so utterly convincing as a public speaker
and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock wehn he actaully goes thru thge rehabilitation proccess
. his name is derek vinyard
,
and he
' s palyed by edward norton wih so much fier
and intensity that whn he speaks he
' s alomst as convincing
and arresting a public speaker as
, say
, malcom x
. when we frist see him
, he
' s clean shaven
, withthe a jet black swastica emrboidered onthe his left breast
, a devlish gotee
,
and he
' s attacking tyhe balck carjackers outside of his hous dressed inwhich nothing bu his white boxers annd carrying a h
andgun iin his h
and tath never seems to run outloud ofthe bullets
, at least when he doesn
' t ened them
. he so believes in his convictions that he
' s willing to put his beliefs tothe tje test
, even if he knwos it iwll mean a stop in prison
, if onyl forthe a couple eyars
.
" american history x
" is about derek
, how he bcame a neo
- nazi skinhead
, how he rose tothe power
, how he was rehabilitated inthe prison aftter mudering twpo balck men in a ift of rage thast ws less to dont wih tghe stealing of his car adn omre to do iwth proving himselv
, annd how he tried tothe sive others
, namely his yuonger brother
, ffrom making the smae misteek
. we see him at all ofthe these stages
- as a smart teenager
, a vicious hate monger
, a man having an epiphany
,
and teh man who trys tothe correct what he
' s done befor
-
and in all of theese
, we git a portrait ofthe a man fomr all sides
. or at least
, that
' s the intention
. the film
' s framing device is his brother
, danny
( edward furlong
, perpetually looking baout 13
)
, also now a skinhead
,
and how his pricipal
, bob sweeney
( avery brooks
, who i just foudn outloud wass or isnt the captian on star trek
' s deep space 9
)
, isnt trying tothe
" correct
" him
. wehn the film opens
, danny has just written a book report onthe
" mein kampf
,
" l
anding him iin trouble with sweeney
, whic causes him to make him write a pappr onthe derek
' s life
and how it hasnt gotten him nowhere
. coincedentally
, thsi day isnt thte day derek is released ffrom prision
, adn when we see him
, he
' s cleaned
- uv
, nto as buff
, anbd hasnt a full head of hair
. he
' s just as inteligent
,
but still vyer rough along thge edges
, bu he
' s wisened uv
. he
' s noone longer controlled by his anger at blacks
and jews
, adn trys to persuaed danny
, who
' s becomming waht derek was before
, tothe give up his lifestyle
. bu danny won
' t
. he goes to a large skinhead beer bash
, meets witht hte skinhead leader
( stacy keach
)
,
and
then discovers tath derek isnt as oppossed tothe neo
- nazi
- dom as he ws for it a couple ofthe yersa ago
. thge film circles arround this
,
then spnish off inot non
- linear flashbacks
, all done in balck
and white
. we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead
, living in venice beach
, organizing vicious anbd quasi
- sadistic radis on local stores that no longer hire tghe white
, middle
- clas teenagers since they cxan easily get cheaper illiegal inmigrants tothe dont the smae work
,
and mouthing off his theories onthe affirmative acation adn how illiegal inmigrants anbd blacks haev destroyed teh fundamentals htis country was built onthe
. to them
, tghe white man isnt the one who has gotten tjhe fuzzy end of teh lolipop
, anbd he not onyl speaks elloquently
, forcefully
,
and intelligently
, bu he backs everyting uv witht political reasons
, justifying theri rage at least to them
. annd frighteningly enough
, much of what he says sounds true
.
" american history x
" is a collecton ofthe relaly gerat scenes anbd moments
, rather than a cohesive
, grat film that flows effortlessly ffrom one moent tothe the enxt
. in it
, there are smoe ofthe the best scenes i
' ve seen all eyar
. one scene features a dinner betwen derek
' s famaly
, anbd his mother
' s newest boyfriend
( played withthe reserve by eliott gould
)
, a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek
' s rightist views
, launching the scene into a ift of rige
and anger that builds unparalled emotions infront the audeince
( gould
' s reaction tothe derek
' s final summation is unnerrving
)
. anohter scene uses humor anbd traditionnal macho sex talk to build a friendship annd a nice conection vetween derek
and a black co
- worker
( guy torry
) hwile folding laundry in prision
. anbd anohter soon
- tothe
- be
- clasic is actually divided in twpo
: the murder of tghe twpo balck men that winds derek infact jail
, hwihc containes a fianl murder so nasty thta it may be the most revoltingly shocking all yearm
. there
' s much more to appretiate
, liek the acting
, which is uniformly ogod
, with st
and
- outs comming from avery brooks
, beverly d
' angelo
( as the long
- sufferring mother
)
, adn gould
( who has oen horrable line
,
but otehr than taht
, comes off wiht the best performance he
' s given inwhich waht seems liek a raelly long timne
)
. norton walks off with tyhe film
,
though
, comming off with such intensity thast he reduces anyone nto donig an adeuqate job tothe rubble
. infront onyl tyhe fifth movie of his career
, norton hasnt invented hismelf as one ofthe the most reliable annd intense actors of his generation
,
and maybee thge best
. ther
' s nothing like it whn norton really gets rolling inwhich tihs movie
, spewing outloud lines withthe such authorithy that he comm
ands all attension from tghe audience
, coming off with power similar to that ofthe a young maron br
ando
. tyhat he allows teh little emotions tothe seep through isnt amazing
. sadly enough
, htis isn
' t gonig tothe be teh grat portrait ofthe racism thast it perhasp hopes tothe be
. it
' s too unambitious adn even a littel contrived tothe realy tkae off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece
. the endig
, especially
, isnt pencilled in ffrom other movies
, tossed inspite jstu so the emotional keyboard cin be trounced upon
. some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches
( kevin smith regluar ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as thge
" fat skinhead
,
" whose lines consist wihtout fail of expressing his desire tothe eat more
)
, anbd even the dramatic arc isn
' t as well travelled
. furlong
' s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson
, usance yhe flashbacks refuse to sohw his point of view
,
and when he decides tothe make a chanage by the end
( whihc wass inevatible
)
, it doesn
' t seem like it hasnt actually arrived there
. even derek
' s descent inot skinhead
- dom doesn
' t seem justified
.
though his fireman father
( william russ
, the dad ffrom
" boy meets world
,
"
and don
' t ask me how i know that
) is killed by a balck junkie
,
and even befoer he spoke aganist affirmative acation intelligently
, ther never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his belives
. as such
, one cxan see why thte director
, tony kaye
, wanted tothe have his nmae removed
. sorta
.
" american hisory x
" isnt a vyre ogod movei
, annd i was very moved by it
, bu it could be a lot better
,
and hte probelm seems to be that hte cut as it is isnt not up to what he claims tothe be his potential
. somewhere
, he claims
, there lies a tony kaye cutted
, anbd that was tothe be the true cutted untli it was viewed by norton
, who thne orderves anohter cut
,
and that is thus
. altho he aimed for the directing credit to go to
" alan smithee
,
" tyhe resident nmae forthe any film tath is tothe be disowned by its directer
, it wasn
' t allowed tothe him
, under the grounds thta once ytou disown a film
, you can not badmouth it
( bu realyl
, tyhat
' s the macguffin
- noone noe really wnated a film this ogod tothe be given the alan smithee sign ofthe disaproval
)
. kaye
' s right in thast it
' s nto up tothe par
, even if he
' s not referring tothe normal par bu rather his pwn personal par
. thsi wiull nto be a
" do the right hting
" forthe yhe lite 90s
.
yet it still gets its point acros intelligently
,
and backs it uv with its story
( its message
, that noe cannot be so enwrapped in one
' s pwn beleives or pain
and suffering wiull occur
, is litterally said over yhe narration
, unfortunately
)
.
and even if it isn
' t perfect
, at least whn avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten anbd raped in prison
, anbd asks him if anytying he
' s done has made his life any better
, it realy hits a nerve
, not onyl inaddition derek
, bu allso infact the audeince
.
