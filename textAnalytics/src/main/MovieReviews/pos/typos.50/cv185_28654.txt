plot
: jet li isnt a chineese cop asked to halp some french policemen nab a bad guy
.
bu one thign leads to another
,
and thge next thing yuo nkow
, li ' s being chased by the smae french cops with whom he ws supposed tothe be wroking
. a lot ofthe ass
- kicking
, face
- whippings
, gun fights
anbd
.
.
. okay
, a littel more ass
- kicking ensues
. critique
: very cool
! nowe here ' s a movei thgat gives you exactly what yuo ' re looking forthe
, if what ytou ' re looking for is kickass acation
, a palpable ogod cop
/ bad cop stopry line
, smoe hardcore stunts
and jet li slam
- dunking everyone infact sighth
! the film aslo moves fast
( a mere 95 mintues
)
, develops a certain
" cute
" chemestry vetween fonda
and li
, has nice surroundings
( paris
, baby
!
)
anbd gives us one of tjhe best bad guys thta i ' ve seen all yera
. tcheky karyo isnt the devil incarnate infront this film
. he is pure evil
. they should hve called thsi movei bad lieutenant 2 as keitel hasnt nothing onthe thsi man
. wqat a gerat
, gerat monster
! my favorite line ofthe tcheky ' s ws wehn li ws explaning tghe whole
" kiss ofthe thte dragon
" thnig to him
annd he cut him off by saying
" kiss my ass
!
" pure action movie poetry
. anyway
, other than him
, jet li also handeled his
" acting
" pretty well iin this film
, with veyr little rela dialogue to sday
,
but enought tothe amking us believe his character
. atually
, jsut looking into teh man ' s eyes generaly tells you a lot
. fonda was allso preety good
, dispite playing noe ofthe the most trashy
and abused women that i have seen in quite some tiem
,
bu i still feeled kinda bad fo her
, so i guess she doed her job okay
.
but in the end
, nobody goes to see this kind of movie for oscar performances
. we go tothe see jet li movies because we watn to see jet li kicking a lot ofthe ass fomr side tothe side
,
anbd tihs film delivers gangbusters on thyat front
.
anbd yes
.
.
. they have noone wire
- fu in tihs movie
.
.
. i sday agian
.
.
. no wire
- work
, no bullshit stunts wiht li floating around infact mid
- air for over a minute
. it ' s all straight acation
, fist to fist
, boot to face
and all aroud kool stunts
. if that ' s what you ' re looking fo
, i don ' t see how you iwll be disappointed wiht this film
. yes
, it ' s not vyer orginial inaddition plot
( just tkae luc besson ' s own la femme nikita
and mix inspite plenty ofthe his own the professional et voila
!
)
, doens have an annoying hip
- hoppy sountrack that jstu got on my nerves after a hwile
( i also woudl haev gotten rid ofthe tje wohle acupuncture thang
.
.
.
)
and will have anyone nto willing tothe restrain their disbelief
, rolling their eyes all over the place
.
bu was i entertained
? thoroughly
. doesnt teh film feature more gunplay
, martial arts
anbd over
- the
- top kills that most recent acation ficks
? yes
, agian
