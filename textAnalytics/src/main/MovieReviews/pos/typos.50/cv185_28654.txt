' s a movei thta gives you exactly what you
' re looking for
, if whta you
' re looking forthe is kickass acation
, a palpable ogod cop
/ bad cop story line

- dunking everyone in sighth
! hte film also moves fast
( a mere 95 minutes
)
, develops a ceratin
" cute
" chemestry beween fonda
and li
, hasnt nice suroundings
( paris
, baby
!
) adn gives us one ofthe tjhe best bad guys that i
' ve seen all year
. tcheky karyo isnt the devil incarnate in thsi film
. he is pure evil
. htey shoud have called this movie bad lewtenant 2 as keitel hasnt nothing on this man
. what a graet
, gerat monster
! my favorite line of tcheky
' s was when li ws explaning the wohle
" kiss ofthe yhe dragon
" hting tothe him adn he cutted him off by saying
" kiss my ass
!
" pure action movei peotry
. anyway
, otehr thna him
, jet li aslo h
andled his
" acting
" pretty well infact tihs film
, with very little rela dialogue tothe sday
,
but enough tothe make us eblieve his character
. actually
, just looking into hte man
' s eyes generally tells you a lot
. fonda ws allso preety good
, dispite palying noe ofthe the most triachy
and abused womens that i have seen in quite some timne
, bu i still falt kinda bad for her
, so i guess she did her job okay
. bu in the end
, nobody goes tothe see thsi kind ofthe movie for oscar performances
. we go to see jet li movies becasue we whant to see jet li kicking a lot of ass from side tothe side
, adn tihs film delivers gangbusters onthe that front
. annd yes

. no wire
- work
, no bullshit stunts with li floating arund inthe mid
- air forthe over a minute
