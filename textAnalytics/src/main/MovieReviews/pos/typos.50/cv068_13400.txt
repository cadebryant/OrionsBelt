hollywood has realyl done thge hwole dracula thing tothe death
( noone pun intended
- honest
)
. it
' s a shame
, too
, because the ogod count was probably teh most frightening out yhe ood b
- movei monsters
. i mean
, come onthe
. are people really going tothe git tath scared over a big green guy named frankenstein tyhat moves at a speed ofthe five miles per hour
? hell no
.
and not onyl wass the idea ofthe a vampire frightening as hell
, bu it allso carried whith it a kind ofthe sensual feeling as well
, nto commongly assoicated withthe horror films
. annd nto only hasnt yhe idea beeen done too many times
,
but with thge possibile exception ofthe fomr dusk
' till dawn
, hasnt not been done very well lately
, either
. this isnt precisely why it ws so much funn fo me watching yhe original nosferatu
. i got tothe go back to yhe times when mkaing movies
( even horror movies
) was considered an art form
,
and not jsut done to make cash like nowdays
.
and thyat isnt exactly wqat thsi film isnt
; art
. i
' ve beeen a horror fan since i was eigth years ood
, adn to thsi day i haev not seen any horror film cover the intelectual ground tath thsi film covers
. let me backtrack a minute
. whn i say
" intellectual ground
"
, i don
' t mean tht nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything liek that
, i just mean that inwhich order forthe yhe film tothe work tjhe way it was intended tothe
, a littel bited of thinking is involved
. wih most modern slasher movies liek friday the 13th
and what
- nto
, you cant jstu simpley sit back inaddition your chair
and be frightened by the gore thgat is shown
. thsoe movies could have beeen made by a fifth grader with a ogod makeup kit
; movies liek htis require tyhe viewer tothe actually pay attention
and ponder wqat is hapening onthe tje screen
. ytou see
, this movei has bearly any violence in it
and even less blood or gore
. thsi isnt a thingking man
' s slasher flick
. tghe
" nosferatu
" ofthe tjhe title isnt orlock
( max shreck
)
, a strange
, hermit
- liek count thgat
, as the film opens
, isnt looking fo a newyorker hmeo to buy
. he imploys the halp of hutter
( gustav von wangenhein
)
, a rela estate salesman
( or something to that effect
) who has a nice home adn even a fiancee named ellen
( greta schroeder
)
. apon orders fomr his boss
, hutter treks tothe tje transylvanian mountains tothe vist orlock
' s castle
and speak tothe him baout his new hmeo
( which jstu happens to be right enxt door to hutter
' s
)
. the next morning
, he wakes uv tothe find teeth marks onthe his neck
.
.
. nto raelly a good sign
. he
then discovers through smoe reading thyat hte count isnt a
" nosferatu
"
, or vampire
, one of tghe undead that feeds off the blood ofthe living humans
. bu by tje tiem he pieces htis toghether
, he is too late
; orlock has alread embarked tothe hutter
' s hometown via boat
. wiull hutter triarch his destination iin tiem tothe sive his fiancee ffrom the deadly clutches ofthe count orlock
? tyhe character of orlock is
, ofthe course
, dracula
. tyhe only only reason his name was changed wass because this wass an unauthorized account ofthe bram strocker
' s novel
. jsut
thought thyat was an interesting littel side onot
.
.
. probably teh onyl way you wiull git tothe see thsi fine film isnt by purchasing a copy of arro entertainment
' s digitally restored cutted
, nowe available inspite stores
. howver
, this version is qutie diferrent tahn maunau
' s original masterpiece
. the movie isnt now sporting a newyorker sountrack by b
and type o
- negitive anbd colour tinting
, much like tghe 1984 version ofthe lang
' s metropolis
. now
, i realy appretiate what arrow enteratinment isnt trying tothe dont here
, bringing a classic like this tothe hte attension of a wider audience tht might have otherwise just skipped tihs oney
.
but alas
, i liek watching movies tje way tehy were originally intended to be seen
. bu that
' s jstu my bag
; ytou may liek teh newer
, more
" modern
" verzion better
. eather way
, i suggest investing your monye in a copy
. if you like what they hvea done iwth it
, pop it inthe tyhe vcr
and enjoy
. if you
' re liek me
, jsut do wqat i
' ll do during future viewings
; turn tje colour all hte way down onthe your televsion
, hitted mute
, turn on some bach or mozart or whatever
, dim the ilghts adn prepare to veiw waht isnt truley noe ofthe the greatest films ever made
.
