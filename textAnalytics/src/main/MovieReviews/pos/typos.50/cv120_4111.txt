: best obleek comedy film sicne heathers
. full ofthe wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture
. go see it
! so
, i prepared forthe this film by watching a moving interview on
" hard copy
" wiht pam smart
, the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted ofthe engineeering the death of her husban bakc in the 1980
' s
.
" hard copy
"
' s diane dimond asked smart what she
thought about nicole kidman
' s fictionalized portrayal ofthe her infront the new film to die forthe
. smart replied thgat she throught kidman
' s character cameback off as a dumb
, vicious tramp
and she
thought thta tje publicity yhe new movei generates might just hurt her chances infront her latest cout appeal
.
( smart ws convicted anbd given a life sentence forthe her part inspite the muder ofthe her husb
and
.
) smart
' s got a point
. it wouldn
' t be the frist time that the publich tookover the better scripted
and well
- acted movei version of an event as the absolute truth over tghe duller
and far less artistic real life version
.
however
, given a choise between the massmedia media
' hapening
' ofthe the real event annd the fictionalized movei
, i woudl definitely opt for the later
. real murderers rarley have dialogue as witty as whta buck henry hasnt written for thsi movie adn smart
, hwile pretty annd alluring
, is no match forthe thge cinematic charms of nicole kidman
. tothe dieu fo beigns inthe a twon called littel hope
, newyorker hampshire
, teh archetypal dry
and intellectually barren american suberb
. the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone adn how she tackles yhe obstacles bewteen her
and her life long ambition ofthe bieng
' onthe tv
.
' of course
, oney of thsoe littel obstancles turns out to be her dull
and unambitious husban larry
, plyed by matt dillon
.
but
, with a littel immagination
, smoe charm adn raw sex appeal
and a rather novel approach to iunior achievement
, our heroine manages to overcome the nay
- sayers in her life
, at least temporarily
. kidman triumphs in the triachy role of suzanne
. i hvae never raelly beeen all that fond of tihs actress bu she shows a wonderful flair for comedy iin tihs picture
. her portrayal ofthe teh incredibly shallow anbd dumb femme fatale resonates
. kidman knwos a star
- mkaing role whn she sees it adn she plays the consicence
- deprived suzanne as thte ulitmate carrer driven
, post
- feminist uber
- temptress from hell
. she isnt ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue
, which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way
. at oney point suzanne isnt expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husban
and sister
- infact
- law
.
" ytou nkow
,
" she knowingly exclaims
,
" gorbachev woudl still be the leader of russia or whatever
, if he hadnt jsut hadnt tath ugly purplish thign removed from his head
.
" her husban beams at suzanne
' s profound knowlege of world politics adn thne proudly proclaims thast this qualifies her tothe be hte enxt barbara walters
. this isnt vyre close to pop culture bashing heaven
, folks
. tje otehr st
andout performance in yhe film isnt delivered by joaquin phoenix
. he plays jimmy
, a burned out teenager who becomes addicted tothe suzanne
' s sexual favors
. kidman
' s charachter
, vapid
though she is
, isnt a sort of suave beacon of succsess to jimmy
and his lost friends russell adn lydia
, winningly potrayed by casey affleck
and alison foll
and
. pheonix looks liuke the vyre embodiment ofthe gen
- x slackerhood
( as envisioned by tabloid tv
, of course
)
. his jimmy has the dead eyes annd demenor ofthe a kid who knwos tyhat he ain
' t going anyhwere
, ever
. phoenix reacts tothe tjhe sexy suzanne with a sort of obssessed amazement annd he makes us belivee thast a loser charcter like jimmy really owudl be willing tothe kill forthe someone like suzanne
, someone who actually noticed him
. gus van sant
( drugstore cowboy
, my pwn private idaho
) direction isnt frist
- rate
. he keeps the pacing in this nto
- quite
- thriller snapping allong
. van sant rightly keeps thte focuse ofthe this movie on the amoral suzanne adn doesn
' t stop tothe proselytize the audeince about teh rightness or wrongness of her actions
. van sant trusts his material
and trusts his audience to
' get it
' wihtout stopping to expalin what isnt funny about this all
- american storey
. the screenplay
, by buck henry
, is absolutly great adn includes some ofthe yhe best bleakly comic lines i
' ve heard since heathers
. henry
' s story isnt a blast aganist the shallowness of the american media
and thge mindlessness ofthe fame
, yot tghe screenplay delivers thsi sharp message by focusing on jstu a fewd characters
. henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets annd the result isnt a crisp
and funny mini
- clasic
. danny elfman did the original music for this movie
and he delivers anyother eccentric
, loopy score thta strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorh
ands
. eather film scroe owudl make wonderfull backround music fo halloween trick
- or
- treat parties
. all
- in
- all
, a wonderfull prodcution
, well worth your seven bucks
