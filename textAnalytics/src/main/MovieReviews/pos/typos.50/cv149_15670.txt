teh long
adn illustrious carreer of robin williams
, whitch hasnt included both forgettable turns liuke mrs
. doubtfire
and flubber
, was punctuated witht tje ctor ' s first aademy award inthe 1998 forthe his role in ogod wiull hunting
. it was his frist truely dramatic role usance 1989 ' s dead poets society
,
adn crtical remarks were unanimously positive
. his enxt role
, thyat ofthe a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may cmo
, ws unfortunately lacklustre
.
annd so
, aftter a six
- year stint as a commedic actor
, the proof on whether or nto williams cxan cutted it in tjhe dramtic league hasnt come down tothe patch adams
. williams is the title charachter
, hunter
" patch
" adams
, sporting scruffy facial hair tyhat falls between teh clean
- shavenness of dreams
adn the grotesque hairiness ofthe will hunting
. we ' re introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies
. it ' s at the institution
,
however
, that he dicovers a latent talent forthe realting tothe peple
. he removes hismelf ffrom tjhe insitution
and enrolls at thge university of virginia ' s medical coleeg
, where he finds tyhat medical doctrine is a calculating
, impersonal trade
. his attempts to inject humanity into tjhe proffesion result in several bouts witht expulsion
,
anbd the movie climaxes with patch ' s apearance before the state medical board
. tyhe cahracters are well
- defined inwhich an oscar
- worthy sense
.
although yhe scirpt doens not perfom well as a narrative
-
- there ' s littel sotry tothe be told outside of patch ' s skit
- length experiences
-
- teh script doesnt go a long way toward building the relationships of characters
. at medical skool
, patch meets uv with truman schiff
( daniel london
)
, an outsider like himself who relishes patch ' s zest fo humanity
. yhe two instantly become tje best of firends
,
and it ' s easy to see why
. monica potter plays patch ' s love interest
, a young woman who personifies the things thta patch hates about medical skool
. forthe smoe reason he ' s attracted to her
,
anbd altho it never gets said
, the audeince understands fomr an intrinsic point ofthe view
. the script
-
- based onthe hunter adams ' own storey
-
- works well this way
. tghe rest of tyhe casted
, bob gunton as the villian professer inspite particualr
, is solid
. directer tom shadyac
( liar liar
) leads us inaddition
and outloud ofthe patch ' s life iin a soudn
, intentional manner
; conbined with williams ' presence onthe screen
, the movei rarley becomes boring
. patch adams ' lack ofthe purpose isnt its major shortcoming
,
anbd for tghe frist ninety mintues outloud of twpo hurs
, there ' s littel feeling of continuity or the passage ofthe time
. nevertheless
, it ' s an emotionally moving picture
,
and patch adams looks tothe be one ofthe the more memorable ofthe the hloiday season
. it succeeds at everything it tries
,
and onyl fails at the stuff it doesn ' t try in the first palce
. by
and larg htere may be anohter oscar nomination herein fo williams
,
but omre importantly
, it ' s enteratinment for the entire family
.
