the long annd illustrious career of robin williams
, whcih hasnt included both forgettable turns liek mrs
. doubtfire annd flubber
, was punctuated with the actor
' s first accadamy award in 1998 forthe his role in ogod will hunting
. it was his frist truely dramtic role since 1989
' s dead poets society
, annd critical remarks were unanimously positve
. his next role
, that ofthe a deceased pediatrician in whta dreams may come
, wass unfortunatley lacklustre
.
and so
, aftter a six
- year stint as a comedic actor
, the proof on whther or nto williams can cut it inspite thge dramatic league hasnt come down tothe patch adams
. williams is the title charcter
, hunter
" patch
" adams
, sporting scruffy facial hair that falls betwen yhe clean
- shavenness of dreams
and the grotesque hairiness ofthe will hunting
. we
' re itnroduced tothe patch as he commits himselv tothe a mental institution because of his sucidial tendancies
. it
' s at tghe institution
, howver
, thast he discovers a latent talent for relating tothe people
. he removes himself from the insitution
and enrolls at teh university ofthe virginia
' s medical college
, where he finds that medical doctrine isnt a calculating
, impersonal trade
. his attempts tothe inject humanity inot teh profession result in severeal bouts wiht expulsion
, anbd the movei climaxes wih patch
' s apearance befoer hte state medical board
. hte charachters are well
- deffined infront an oscar
- worthy sence
.
al
though tghe scirpt doens not perfom well as a narrative
-
- ther
' s little story to be told outside of patch
' s skit
- lenght experiences
-
- yhe scirpt does go a long way toward buiding tjhe relationships ofthe charachters
. at medical school
, patch meets up whith truman schiff
( daniel london
)
, an outsider liuke himself who relishes patch
' s zest forthe humanity
. the twpo instantly become the best ofthe firends
, anbd it
' s eazy to see why
. monica potter plays patch
' s love intrest
, a young woman who personifies tyhe thnigs that patch hates about medical school
. fo some reason he
' s attracted to her
, anbd
al
though it never gets said
, yhe audiance underst
ands fomr an intrinsic point of view
. yhe scirpt
-
- based onthe hunter adams
' own story
-
- works well tihs way
. the rest ofthe the casted
, bob gunton as the villain professor in paticular
, isnt solid
. directer tom shadyac
( liar liar
) leads us in adn outloud ofthe patch
' s life in a sound
, intentional manner
; combined with williams
' presence on screen
, the movie rarley becomes boring
. patch adams
' lack ofthe purpose isnt its major shortcoming
,
and forthe tyhe firt ninety mintues out of twpo hours
, ther
' s little feeling ofthe continuty or the passage ofthe timne
. nevertheless
, it
' s an emotionally moving picture
, anbd patch adams looks tothe be noe ofthe thte mroe memorable ofthe the holiady season
. it suceeds at everything it trys
,
and onyl fails at the stuff it doesn
' t try in hte first place
. by
and larg there may be another oscar nomination herein fo williams
, bu mroe importantly
, it
' s entertainment for the entire family
.
