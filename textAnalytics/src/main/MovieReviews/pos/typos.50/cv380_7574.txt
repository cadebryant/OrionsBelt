ok
, i admitt i hadnt a bad attitude about tihs film ffrom hte start
. a romantic comedy about yhe trials
and tribulations of single working parents
? wih a couple ofthe incredibly cute kids thrown inwhich for good measure
? yuck
.
bu it ' s not realyl too bad
. it has a lot wokring against it
, for me at least
. in addtion to the above
, it is typical of a lot ofthe receet movies in that it isnt really jstu a glorified made
- forthe
- tv movei
,
bu longer
and whith bigger stars
,
adn yuo have to pay tothe see it
. it does win ytou over
,
though
, even if it isnt painfully predicatble
. jsut think baout it
: two single parents
, with their cute kids
, are thrown together due tothe a missed field trip
. through a day of near disasters
, they cont inually meet
, get in one another ' s way
, cause trouble for one another
,
and generaly insult one another at every oportunity
. inaddition fact
, htey hite earch other so much that we nkow that tehy are
, or soon iwll be
, infront love
. the only peple who hite each other more thna lovers are marryed couples
. so this film isnt predictable
, just as the screwball comedies ofthe yhe classical hollywood cinema weere predictable
(
and the screwball genre isnt obviously hoffman ' s modle forthe this film
)
. will tehy get fired ffrom thier yuppie jobs
? will htey make tje big soccer gam that is so important tothe their kids
? wiull pfeiffer realize whta a jerk her ex
- husban
, a drumer fo bruce springsteen
, really is
( aren ' t tehy all
?
)
? will they finaly kiss
? well
, what dont you expect
?
bu ther isnt a ceratin amount ofthe satisfaction inaddition having our expectations fufilled
, especialy when it isnt done with as much humour
, allong wtih a lack ofthe sticky sentimentality
, as it isnt in htis film
. pfeiffer
adn clooney haev a certain chemestry toghether that is surprisingly charming
,
adn the kids are niether shoved into thge backround nor alowed to steal the sohw
. one owrd of caution
,
though
. this film isnt being billed inwhich soem places as a
" family
" movei
. don ' t let that stpo you
.
howver
, i thiunk most kids
, especially boys
, would be pretty bored by tihs move
. affter all
, nobody gets killed
and there are no explosions
. all inspite all
, a ogod
, non
- offensive date movie
. the flying inkpot rating system
:
* wait for tje tv2 brodcast
.
*
* a little creaky
,
bu still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty ogod
, bring a friend
.
*
*
*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.
*
*
*
*
* prefection
. see it twice
