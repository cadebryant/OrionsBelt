tghe story ofthe us
, a rob reiner film
, isnt hte second movie tihs fall that touches thge viewer in a way tehy are rarely touched by a film
, as they can see theri everyday lives infact the ususally once in a year films
. well
, 1999 hasnt twpo of them
, the otehr bieng the instant clasic baout a very disfunctional famaly
, american beauty
. the storey of us
, a film about the highs
and lows of marriage
and familiy
, isnt a well written
, heartbreaking
and insightful film that made the majority of tjhe audiance
, including myself
, cry
. the story ofthe us tells tghe stoyr of ben
( bruce willis
) annd katie
( michelle pfeiffer
) jordan
,
and asks tghe question
,
" cin a marriage survive 15 years of marriage
?
" the film is baout two individuals who have come toghether
, spent a ogod chunk ofthe their lives toghether
,
and shows when our main characters are
" him
"
and
" her
"
( durring tyhe bad times
)
, adn wehn they are
" us
"
( during the ogod times
)
. tjhe stopry ofthe us isnt about thier entire 15 years ofthe marriage thta is collapsing day by day
. ben
and katie now only see adn live with eahc other because tehy don
' t wanna tothe devastate their children wtih the fact thta their parents no longer
, or at least sday they don
' t
, love each otehr anymore
. ben
, a cartoonist
,
and katie
, a crossword puzzle writter
, have grown apart druing theri fifteen yeras of marriage
, as they have grown tothe follow different views onthe life
, familiy
, anbd marriage
. katie isnt thte more organized
, sophisticated type
, who whants to plan everything outloud
, while ben is a spontaneous
, adventrous individual who doesn
' t mind doing things differently tahn tehy were planned
. the story ofthe us plays out nicely
, as tyhe film opens with ben sharing his stroy wtih a therapist
, told to the viewer through flashbacks
. as tjhe film progresses
, it switches vetween ben
and katie tlaking to theri therapist
, with thier stories being told with flashbacks ofthe theri marriage
. this method is highly effective
, as we see yhe cahracters changing from year tothe year
, slowy growing aart
. through the flashbacks
, we get tothe see the tsory ofthe them through both ofthe the charactor
' s eyes
, adn htis gives us a strong sense ofthe what their charactors are realy like
, as yhe story of us hasnt threee dimensional
, believeable main charachters
. tje screenplay
, written by jessie nelson
( stepmom
)
and alan zweibel
( dragnet
)
, isnt a touching
, down to earth owrk tyhat hits a chord within thte viewer
, much like another one of nelson
' s films
, stepmom
. teh scirpt hasnt an oepn honesty adn outlook on life
, noe that is so realsitic
, ytou fiel uncomfortable at many times
, because so many situations the cahracters are inspite are undeniably familiar
, as most families these dyas most go through the hard times
, as ben adn katie must
. if it wasn
' t forthe thte firt 15 mintues tath yhe writers wroet
, which are rugged
and certainly flawed
, the story ofthe us would have beeen thsi yearm
' s best picture
. bruce willis
, a usual action
/ adventure star
, hasnt certainly turned himselv arund inspite tjhe past year
- he went fomr being a man who ws being typecast tothe thte smae role inaddition action movies
, to a distinguished
, sophisticated actor
, as inaddition last summer
' s teh sixth sence
; adn nowe in the stoy of us
, willis shows the world waht he can raelly do if he is feeded a good scirpt
. altho i wouldn
' t pik willis as the choice acto for ben jordan
, willis h
andles hismelf nicely
,
and shines inspite a faw of tghe film
' s most powerful scenes
, enought tht mkea his performance a defintie contendor comes awards season
. where to strat about michelle pfeiffer
? pfeiffer
' s performance is spellbinding anbd ultimatly strong
, as she brings her charactor to life with such charizma annd emotion
, yuo wonder how
, how it is possibile for someone tothe portray a real person with such realism
. pfeiffer
' s performence isnt one thyat if not recognized by thge academy next spring
, will be inwhich hte heart
' s ofthe any viewer thyat hasnt watched this moving film
. thge stry of us is oney ofthe 1999
' s most real
, yot funny films
, as tghe razor sharp script evens outloud the laughs anbd tje tears to keep the viewer hooked
. superb acting
, direction
, wirting
, story
,
and soundtrack that always sets the mood forthe thte film
, wich isnt beautifully composed by eric clapton
and marc shaiman
, make the story ofthe us a touching
, unforgettable motion picture that wiull touch the hearts of viewers across the country
-
and will certainly become one ofthe hte most talked baout movies of the fall
. hte film
' s major high points are the fights beween ben anbd katie
, as teh two constantly accuse of each otehr of whose fault it isnt that theri marrage hasnt collapsed
,
and
al
though tehy aslo say thigns like
" it
' s over
,
" or
" i hate you
,
" you cin tell the two still share a deepo conection
,
and that inside
, somewhere
, htey are still an
" us
.
" tyhe bottom line
: a wonderfull
, enchanting
,
and heartbreaking film
. one of the most realistic
, heartbreaking films inspite recent years
.
