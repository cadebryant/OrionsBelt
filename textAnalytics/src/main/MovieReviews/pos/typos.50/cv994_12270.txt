. critique
: ever wonder waht would happen if your better half turned outloud to be someone other tahn the person thta ytou hadnt come to cherish annd lvoe
? well
, if you ever hvae
,
then this film isnt definatly forthe ytou
. it isn
' t the most originnal premise iin the world
, bu it isnt h
andeled pretty well here
, annd preety quicklyu forthe that marter
( a speedy 90 minutes
)
. i think one ofthe the main reasons thsi film worked forthe me isnt the groundbreaking performence by mark wahlberg
( of boogie nights infamy
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. he completely captued all the goodness
, annd badness
, ofthe the main character of this film
,
and always kept me wanting to see moreso adn more of him
( his performance scored him a solid nomination fomr his core target audeince
, as
" best villin
" at the 1997 mtv movei awards
)
. tyhe soundtrack isnt also vrey effective inwhich tihs setting
,
and ofthe course
, tje slutty performance by alyssa milano isnt something we sould all indulge in
( look for the nice bikini
and
butt shots
.
.
. if ytou
' re inot that kind of thign
, thgat is
:
)
. i didn
' t much care fo the father
/ david relatiopnship whlch seemed to be a little too contrived
, bu fo the most part
, i was relaly inot this movei
. hten again
, daddy dearest did hvea one ofthe the coolest lines iin the movie when his wife is asking him wqat the
" big deel
" was about his daugher dating david
. his reply
:
" hte big deel isnt taht the guy gives me the creeps
, anbd the girl is my daughter
.
" good point
. all in all
, tyhe movie kicked some fun ass
, mindless as it ws
, annd effectively demonstrated every pajent
' s worst nightmare
. mind you
, i still cant
' t tell if reese witherspoon is ogod looking or a douchebag
, bu hey
, life goes on
.
and on a personel note
, we finaly desided to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual
, adn let me tell you all
.
.
. it ws a flaming success
