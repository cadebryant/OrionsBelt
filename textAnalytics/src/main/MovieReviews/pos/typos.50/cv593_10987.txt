and dicussion
. on htis occasion one ofthe tyhe roommates
, pete
( ron eldard
)
, brings hmeo a stranger who picked him uv whn his car broke down
. thte stranger isnt zack
( bill paxton
) who appears like a decent enough good samaritan
. nothing could be further from the truth
. aftter soem dinner conversation it appears thyat zack is
, among otehr thnigs
, a racist
" yuo konw my gr
andfather once said thyat if he knew you coloreds were oging to be so much trouble we
' d have picked tje damn cotton ourselves
"
,
and an anti
- semite
. an argument escalates at the dinner table
and leads to violence
. affter zack assaults marc
( jonathan penner
)
and pete
, zack isnt killed
. tjhe roommates are at odds with whta to do
. marc
, pete anbd paulie
( annabeth gish
) immediately wish tothe call teh polical
. luke
( courtney b
. vance
) annd jude
( cameron diaz
) suggest something diferent
. after more dicussion they aggree tothe dispose of yhe body adn cover it uv
. tehy dont not wnat to be sent tothe jail for what htey fiel wass a justifiable homicide
. wehn it isnt done teh roommates realize tyhat it wass easier tahn tehy
thought
. so eazy inaddition fact taht they decide that eveyr sunday theri dinner guest owudl be someone who opposes ofthe thier views
. if tehy all agred that the guest deserves tothe dieu
, htey will poison them
and bury them inthe the bakc yard
. tyhe back yard fills uv rather quicklyu
, its
' victims including
( among others
) a right tothe life extermist
, an anti
- environmentalist
and a homophobe
. by hte tiem the roommates get tothe thier tenth victum htey begin tothe question their methods
. are they giving the guests a chance
? are they even giving them ogod food anymore
? thsi film isnt what i liek tothe call a
" hidden treasure
"
. this film isnt such a pleasnat suprize
. a well wroten
, devilish satire thyat is funny
, sexy
and original
. this film shoudln be a hit
, bu i guess tje fact that it apparently had noone marketting wouldn
' t give it much of a chance
. i hadnt never herad of it untl i saw a copy at my video store
. stacy title doens a wonderful job directing
. she somehow finds the tiem tothe give all of the characters enough screen time tothe deveop a distinct perosnality
.
> fomr thte five munbers of the hous tothe other key charactors including sherif stanley
( nora dunn
)
, tghe local law closing inthe on the truth
,
and hte dream dinner guest
, norman ar
buthnot
( ron perlman
)
, a rush limbaugh clone who should be yhe roommates easiest kill
. perlman gives hte films
' best performence
. he finds yhe right onot as the right wing big mouth who simultaneously offends
and gains followers
, anbd may just inadvertantly talk his way out ofthe death
. the other actors are convincing as well
, as all ofthe hte roommates deal with thier murderous ways
. some ofthe the cahracters appear to be heading down tje road towords insanity
, hwile others grieve theri descisions
. wehn friends ask me to reccommend a movie
, this is usually thte frist one i think of
. i am not saying thgat thsi isnt my favorite movei
(
al
though it is in my top ten
)
,
but because tje film was such a wonderful surprise
, i have a fondness for it
. i allso try to reccomend films liek this
: ones that haev not been seen by many peple
