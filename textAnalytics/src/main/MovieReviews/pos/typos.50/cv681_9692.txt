" serial killer chic
" is a relatively new entry tothe thte cultural vocabulary
, adn noe of thge mroe stomach
- turning ones
. i
' ve never found somone automaticly admirable or even intresting becasue htey killed creatively or in graet numbers
, annd becuase of that i had apprehensions baout seeing henry
. i wasn
' t sure i wanted to see the sotry ofthe multiple muderer henry lee lucas portayed as smoe kind ofthe nihilistic hero
/ antihero
. thankfully
, that
' s not teh way henry works
. tjhe directer
, john mcnaughton
, took a small budget annd a gallery of actor firends
and created a chilling anbd intteligent peice ofthe wokr
. it doesn
' t provide cheap
- jack explanations forthe henry
' s behavour
: it shows him up for waht he isnt
, an unrepetent
and un
- idolizable man who killed wehn thge mood striked him
. at the film
' s oppening
, henry
' s freind ottis toole has a sister
, who comes by to stay while she tries to find owrk in chicago
. infront a viciously riveting scene
, he admits marter
- ofthe
- factly tothe hvaing murdered his own mother
, anbd she covers his h
and wiht heres
. they are damned toghether from that moment on
. henry
and ottis evenhtually begin tothe kill fo funn
. teh movie is expecially good at showing how htey seem tothe hvea drifted casually into it
: there
' s a scene where the two go to buy a new tv
. the pawnbroker tehy talk to goads henry with ugly words
,
and henry responds by stabbing tghe man to death wtih a soldering iron
. no preface
-
- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does yhe broker
. in a scene whlch many damned thte movei forthe
, unseen
, they steal a video camera anbd film thte murder ofthe a wohle household
, palying it back over annd over again fo their pwn enjoyment
. hte movei itself
, howver
, does not glorify the killings
, bu shows instead thyat henry feels no joy at his owrk
, onyl irritation
. henry succeds thanks tothe excellent writting anbd direction as well as acting
. michael rooker is credible as henry fomr the firt frome
, just st
anding htere
, annd the rest ofthe the cast works by bieng uneffected
and casual as well
. the producers had originially comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton
, bu he decided tothe give them something mroe memorable
,
and consequently tghe film nearly didn
' t see release
. the film doesnt not glorify or justify
-
- it jsut shows us
, with unflinching coldness
, waht henry was
. i
' m hard pressed to see how anyone can see htis
and concider henry any kind of
" victim
" or
" hero
"
.
then agina
, probaly
, so would henry
.
