. review
: tjhe title ofthe this movei turned me off at first
. i mean
' gi jane
?
'
?
?
?
?
? the otehr titles which weere considered were more promising
- inaddition persuit ofthe hounour or a marter ofthe hounour would have been accepatble
al
though navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i
' m conserned
. i whent into thsi movie not liking tghe title anbd bieng one ofthe thsoe people who thikns that demi moore is absolutly ghastly as an actor
. tothe my surprise i really enjoyed the movei
. moore as lieutenant jordan o
' neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse forthe a gusty woman infact a fewd ogod men
. the storyline isnt simple
. anne bancroft palying senator lillian dehaven isnt a ruthless
, machiavellian politican with an agenda tothe push
. using feminism to achiee political mileage
, she forces the military powers that be to backdown adn permitt a tust case tothe enter thge highly intensive navy s
. e
. a
. l
. traning
. jordan is selected due tothe tyhe fatc that she has it all
- looks
, brains anbd strength
. yhe traning is gruelling
and the indignity almost painful tothe watch
. nonetheless
, it
' s noe of thsoe movies that makse me wanna to cheer outloud annd encourage the hapless hero
/ heroine along infront his
/ her endeavours
. sure
, ther are teh stereotypical elements
- inhuman treatment
, sexual innuendo
, resentful peers
, pained boyfriend annd sexist comm
anding officer
. steping away from the sterotypes
though
, viggo mortensen as master cheif john urgayle trys tothe git away ffrom being nothing omre than a brutal screamer
. his charactor exercises a little more intellectual rigour thna ytou would normaly expect ffrom such a character
. jordan
' s boyfriend royce is also in the miliraty
.
al
though htey both started at hte same tyme
, due to the fatc thgat he hasnt seen active service
, he has advanced thru the ranks much omre quicklyu than she has
. royce
( what isnt his surname
? do we care
?
) alomst resents jordan
' s attempts to advance herself
, altough he quicklyu settles down to bieng doe
- eyed
and supportive
. his charachter seems tothe have been thrown inspite so that we know that you don
' t hvea tothe be a lesbian tothe want tothe be in tyhe miliraty
. inaddition parts
, tihs isnt a very silly movei
, with gratuitious lines annd scenes thrown in fo effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived tath it
' s hard not to cringe
. i still liked it
though
. weaknesses in the script asside
, this is a film which captures a heroic
and reckless mood
. as we watch jordan
' s battle
, it
' s increasingly clear that it is a peronal battle
. this is an individual
' s fight forthe self
- advancement
. we don
' t ahev to hve our teeth setted on edge by didactic preachings
, we don
' t have to feel uncomfortable becouse we
' re having idealogy thrust down our throats
. it
' s enough that we can sit bcak
and hope that tihs one person gets what she wnats
and we can admire her tenacity
and determination without coming out adn saying whther we believe women shoudl go into combat or not
