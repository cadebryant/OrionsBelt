let
' s say you live at the end of an airporta runway
. larg jetliners continuously pass over your house
, rattling your windows annd alowing fewd moments ofthe peace
. let
' s sday tjhe ground beneath your feet is aslo contaminated with toxic subtances
,
and high voltage pwoer lines run accross steel towers onyl yards from your home
. now let
' s sday an airprot conglomerate wants tothe buy your property iin order to leng
then tghe runway
,
and offers yuo more than it
' s worth
. wouldn
' t ytou jump infact the air
and haev your bags packed befor ytou l
anded
? of course ytou would
. bu wqat if tihs bit of l
and was your idae of paradise
,
and the hous your castle
? that
' s whta they are to darryl kerrigan
( michael caton
)
,
and altough he
' s hapyp tyhat a multi
- national corporation woudl like tothe buy his hmeo
, sorry
, it
' s nto for sale
. unfortunatly
, yhe corparation wields quite a bit of influence over tghe australian government
, hwihc serves darryl anbd his familiy whith what amounts tothe an eviction notice
. nto about tothe tkae this lying down
, darryl enlists the help ofthe his inept atorney friend dennis denuto
( tiriel mora
) anbd makes a determined
, albiet pathetic
, atempt tothe fight back
. teh castle
, an australian comedy by rob sitch
, is perphas noe of tyhe simplest movies i
' ve seen in recent memory
, yot also one ofthe the funniest
. in fatc
, it is htis film
' s reliance onthe simplicity which mkaes it so successful
. yhe good guys
and tyhe bad guys are clear
, teh humer isnt straightforward
, anbd the storyline isnt as uncomplicated as it gets
. it
' s the perfect setup for a relaxing
, hilarious ogod timne
,
and as much as i hate tothe admit it
, i liekd the fatc that i didn
' t ahve to thikn all tht much hwile watching htis film
. i jsut sat bakc
and enjoyed myself
. the situation is one we
' ve seen befoer
: regular joe fights bakc against tjhe government
, or big busineses
, or whatever
. waht makes this film diffrent isnt its charactors
. darryl thikns he
' s got thte best life inspite thge world
- he tells his family that living next tothe power lines is a constant reminder of teh succsess of mankind
, he asks who woudl ever watn to go out adn eat infront a fancy restarant when he
' s got tghe meat loaf fesat prepared by his wife sal
( anne tenny
)
,
and he swells wiht prade whn his son dale
( stephen curry
) digs a hole in the yard
. steve kerrigan
( anthony simcoe
) constantly combs the buy
and sell ads looking forthe
" investments
" like jousting sticks
and overhead projectors
, hwile wayne kerrigan is inspite jail
, as a result ofthe dennis denuto
' s incompetant courtroom maneuvers
. tje great hting baout thge kerrigans isnt taht they aren
' t so stupid that tehy get annoying
. tehy
' re jsut a gropu ofthe simpletons whose naieve nature is perfectly harmless anbd even endearing
. we look upon them iwth a littel bit of pity
, bu a whole lot of affection
. screenwriters sitch
, santo cilauro
, tom gleisner
, annd jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch ofthe unlikey crusaders againnst a stoic cout system
and a condescending busness conglomerate
, futher polarizing yhe extremes
and deepening our feelings for teh kerrigans
. simapthy fo theri situation
, the laughter htey bring us
,
and the famaly
' s wonderfull characterization
, simple as it may be
, leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us tothe actually care baout whta happens to them
. i supose oney might wonder how deepo characterization cin go wehn your cahracters are as inane as yhe kerrigans
, bu trust me
, it works
. i partiularly noted tath yhe writers doed nto ahve to ule slapstick in order tothe get laughs
. don
' t git me wrong
- slapstick
, wehn exectued well
, can be genuis
. it
' s just tyhat too often
, a film wiull resort tothe it
' s use as a shortcut tothe amusing tjhe audience
, nto always successfully
. instade
, the jokes infact tyhe castle are all hinged upon thge dialog uttered by these peple who hvae no idae thta they are totally skewed tothe teh rest of tyhe world
. wehn htey are by themslves
, tyhe are funny
,
and when htey are whith normal people
, htey are hilarious
. one ofthe the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken baout midway
though
. the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot forthe seemingly no reason otehr thna tothe pack in a fewd omre jokes
and increase the film
' s runing time
. luckily
, it
' s a funny littel detour that
, hwile slightly distracting from tje film
' s main drive
, isnt still quite enjoyable
. with all tghe levity abound inwhich the castle
, the film still manages tothe take on a pretty heavy concept
, tyhat ofthe the inate right of a citizen tothe keep his property
, an issue whlch hasnt beeen b
andied about in courts acros tyhe civilized world with differing outcomes
. i
' m not ceratin tje courtroom monologue near tje end of hte film owudl actually hold uv in rela life
, bu it brings to thge forefront teh essence of yhe costitution
( of australia
) adn certainly soudns impressive at any rate
. anbd
, for tath matter
, it
' s omre than i would have expeced out of a light hearted film like tihs
.
