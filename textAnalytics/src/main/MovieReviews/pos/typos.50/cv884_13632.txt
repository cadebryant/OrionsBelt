and kingpin
( 8

, brings together the rela
- life cuple ofthe cameron diaz adn matt dillon
, some nasty humour
, a cute dog
,
and a mix of lvoe
, fate
and romance
. plot
: high
- school nerd ted gets lucky when the cutest girl iin his clas asks him tothe the prom
. unfortunatley for ted

, it turns outloud thyat mary has mroe than one suitor
,
and tyhat
' s whn hte real fun beigns
. critique
: likeable comedy with a faw extremely funny scenes
, smoe funny looking peopel
,
and a plot that won
' t ever put you to sleep
. hvaing said that
, i must admited that i doed like tjhe farrellys
' two previvous films moreso than thsi one
, bu that isnt saying a lot
, sicne i really did lveo thsoe earlier pics
. tihs one isnt also quite funny
, bu it didn
' t really blow me awya liuke thte others
. thne agian
, maybe my expectations weere too high
.
then again
, maybe i shoudl shut up
,
and rwite a littel moreso about tghe film
, anbd less about my supposed subconscious reasons for liking
/ disliking the film
. continuing where theri other pictures left off
, yhe farrellys
' create a cutesy world of people with strange adn endearing qualities
,
and a simple plot by whic tothe tye them all toghether
. thsi noe aslo includes plenty of toilet humour
, bu allso some borderline funn
- makeing of tghe disabled
and mentally
- challenged
. i must admit thgat i realyl wasn
' t sure whether to laugh at soem points or nto
. not a good palce tothe be
. having said that
, tghe scenes thgat doed tear thru hte audience
, adn yours truly
, were extremely hillarious
, adn whent on for several mintues after thge punchline
. tje laughter practically killed out tghe enxt scene forthe one of yhe best ones in tje movei
( something tothe do iwth hair gel
)
. onthe teh negitive end
, i doed nto like hte musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through hte entire picture
. i found them qtuie useless
, unfunny anbd distracting
. alsot
, i found that a lot ofthe the funnier scenes had arleady beeen shown in the film
' s trailer
.
and of course
, i never quite buy tyhe fatc that these beautyfull
, intelligent
, single womens still can
' t seem tothe fidn hte
" right guy
"

, amke sure that you stay fo the credits
, because there isnt an entire montage of outtakes from tyhe film thyat plays under a lip
