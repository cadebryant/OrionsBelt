, after dumb
annd dumber
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
annd kingpin
( 8
/ 10
)
, brings toghether the rela
- life couple of cameron diaz
anbd matt dillon
, smoe nasty humour
, a cute dog
,
and a mix of love
, fate
and romance
. plot
: high
- school nerd ted gets lucky whn tjhe cutest girl in his clas asks him to the prom
. unfortunatley forthe ted
, he accidenally gets a part of his male anatomy
( ouch
!
) caught inthe his zipper
,
adn misses hte big night
. thirteen years later
, ted still cant ' t git mary outloud ofthe his mind
,
and hires a private detective
( dillon
) to find her
. once foudn
, it turns out that mary has mroe than one suitor
,
and that ' s when tje rela fun beigns
. critique
: likeable comedy with a faw extremly funny scenes
, soem funny looking people
,
and a plot that won ' t ever put you to sleep
. having said thast
, i must admiting that i doed like the farrellys ' twpo previvous films moreso thna htis one
,
but tyhat isnt saying a lot
, since i relaly did lvoe those earlier pics
. this oen is also qtuie funny
,
bu it didn ' t realy blow me away like the others
.
thn again
, maybe my expectations were too high
.
thne again
, maybe i shoudln shut up
,
and write a littel moreso baout the film
,
adn less about my suppossed subconscious reasons for liking
/ disliking the film
. continuing where their other pictures left off
, tyhe farrellys ' create a cutesy world ofthe peple whith stange
and endearing qualities
,
annd a simple plot by which tothe tye them all together
. this oney aslo includes plenty ofthe toilet humour
,
but also soem borderline funn
- makeing of tjhe disabled
anbd mentally
- challenged
. i must admit that i really wasn ' t sure whther to laugh at some points or nto
. not a good palce tothe be
. haveing said tht
, the scenes that did tear thru the audiance
,
and yours truley
, weere extremely hillarious
,
and went on for severeal minutes after the punchline
. the laughter practically killed out the next scene for one ofthe the best ones in the movie
( something to do witht hair gel
)
. on teh negative end
, i did nto like the musical interludes of jonathan richman that ran through thge entire picture
. i foudn them quite useless
, unfunny
and distracting
. also
, i foudn that a lot of the funnier scenes hadnt already beeen shown in the film ' s trailer
.
and ofthe course
, i never quite buy the fact that these beautyfull
, intelligent
, single women still cxan ' t seem tothe fidn the
" right guy
"
( see kiss the girls
( 7
/ 10
)
. i did raelly liuke all ofthe tjhe actors in the film
, especially ben stiller
, who appears tothe be solidifying his mark as a gerat comical ator with thsi picture
adn oen of my favourites from 1996
, flirting with diaster
( 8
/ 10
)
. i also liekd matt dillon withthe his big teeth
,
anbd lee evans with his superb faux
- simapthy brittish accent
. funny stuff
. allso
, make sure that ytou stay for tje credits
, because ther is an entire montage of outtakes from the film that plays under a lip
- synched version ofthe
" build me up buttercup
"
, which is really kool
. overall
, a cute comedy iwth a decent premise
,
annd a few particularly hillarious scenes
. little known facts
