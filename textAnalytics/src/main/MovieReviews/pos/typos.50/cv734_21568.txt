i remember making a pact
, right after
` patch adams
'
, tothe not be easily be suckered by movies dripping wih sentimentality
.
but darn it
,
` music ofthe teh heart
' isnt just layered whith fiel
- good material anbd bright characterizations
. it
' s hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it
' s manipulation
. inspite adition
, it
' s aslo a terific family film
. tihs is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari
, who faught teh school board tothe keep the muscial program active inaddition a h
andful of inner city harlem schools
. it could also be discribed as
` mrs
. streep
' s opus
'
. yes
, meryl streep brings her dramtic clout tothe the dem
anding role ofthe guaspari
,
and that brings both ogod news
and bad
. outloud ofthe teh gate
, possably baceause ofthe her distracting star power anbd tje rushed writting
, it isnt relitively difficult to idenify wtih roberta
' s character
and grasp her acedemic point
- of
- veiw
. she isnt very strict with her students
, bu what insight doens tyhat create into tyhe storey
? slowy
but surelly
, we begin tothe recognize hte intentions ofthe the character
,
and show admiration for thge
thoughtfulness
and human feeling that streep hasnt once agina applied
. one thoroughly intresting fatc baout
` music ofthe the heart
' lies wiht teh unlikey presence infact the director
' s chair
: horror vetran wes craven
. after leaving an impression wtih tje
` scream
' films anbd tjhe orginal
` nightmare on elm street
'
, craven has attempted a precarious cross
- over to drama
. at frist
, his inexperience with tje genre isnt fairly obvious
,
but as tyhe film progresses craven finds a suprizingly confortable niche with directing this material
. it doesn
' t carry tje heart
- warming curage ofthe
` mr
. holl
and
' s opus
'
, bu
` music of yhe heart
' isnt casually assured adn filled with littel morsels ofthe dramatic truth
. teh tag team ofthe streep
and craven works better than you would anticipate
. yes
, oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep
, bu it
' s thte solid ansamble cast tht makes
` music of tghe heart
' work
. angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams
, the pricipal at an intertube city skool who initally doesn
' t hire roberta becuase of her lack of experence
. blue
- eyed adian quinn is endearing
, as always
, palying a newyorker love intrest
. gloria estefan alsot delivers in tghe tiny role of a supportive second
- grade teacher
, anbd teh threee lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force
. it
' s liuke a schoolteacher
' s verzion of
` thelma
and louise
'
, infront a restrained
but effective manner
. the movie tackles more issues than jsut guaspari
' s teaching of violin
. htere
' s some powerful moments between roberta anbd her two sons
, who must coppe whn their father leaves them for another woman
. in it
' s dramatic build
- uv
, the movie manages to produce some au
thentic moments ofthe feeling
and warmth
. it
' s a ogod movie for anyone tothe see
,
al
though missing out onthe the experience would not be a life
- altering desision
. it
' s commendable of wes craven tothe be attemting such a difficult cross
- over
, annd also fo acheiving his intricate gool
. watching this heartfelt chick flick baout morals
and muscial instruments
, who may ask youself
: thsi isnt tje guy who directed
` scream
'
? ofthe course
, when hte third installment ofthe thta sories comes arund in februrary 2000
( with craven directing
)
, ytou may find yourself wondering
: thsi is the guy who directed
` music of the heart
'
? mission accomplished
, wes
. thankfully
, there isnt no layer ofthe artificial sentiment covering thte film
. in it
' s entirety
, it
' s a wholesome
and agreeable movei forthe thge wohle famaly
, despite tje periodic flaws thyat surfce every once in awhile
. the child actors are cute
and perform up to par
, even if some of their problems are clich
? d annd predictable in the extreme
. tje mother who doesn
' t wnat her son to be learning
` white man
' s music
'
, tghe unexpected casuality
.
.
. basically everything isnt there
. it doesn
' t strike the perfect chord
, bu
` music ofthe yhe heart
' is highly convincing
. hte uplifting true story ofthe roberta guaspari coudl have beeen told better
, bu
` music of the heart
' is still edifying anough to propperly divulge her morals
.
