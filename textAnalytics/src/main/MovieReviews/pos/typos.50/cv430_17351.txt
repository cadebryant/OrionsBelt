and boyfriend clumsily try tothe sive her
. comments
: mute witness came as a surprize to me the first timne i watched it
. drawed by teh clever artwork on the video box
, i rented the film expecting a complete turey
. mute wittness
,
however
, wass original
, offbeat
,
and well
- made
. it ' s oney ofthe those kool littel finds that no one seems to konw about
. i ' ve subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit
,
annd it may be seen
, on occasion
, on teh idependent film channel
. the firt hour of mute wittness isnt extremely tense
, as billy
, the quite believable mute heroine
, sees munbers of the russion mob brutally kill a prostitute hwile filming an illegal snuff film
. tje rest of the film takes good advantage ofthe billy ' s vulnerable position as a mute foriegner in moscow bieng pursued by poverful criminal figures
. to throw a curveball into the fray
, billy ' s sister karen
and her filmmaking beau become bizzare figures ofthe comic relief to offset sevral voilent sequences infact waht are soem genuinely funny scenes
. a disappointingly trite endig
and ocassional comic blunders are tje only twpo things which mar htis otherwise suspenseful film
. look for alec guiness
( obi
- wan kenobi ffrom teh frist star wars trilogy
) in a small role as the evil reaper
. definately check tihs movie outloud
;
although
, as a word of warning
, it doesnt contain several scenes ofthe rether grisly violentce whic certainly aren ' t for thte squeamish
.
