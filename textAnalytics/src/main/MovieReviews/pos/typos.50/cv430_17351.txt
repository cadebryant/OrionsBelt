: mute witness came as a suprize to me tje first time i watched it
. drawn by tje clever artwork onthe tyhe video box
, i rented the film expecting a complete trkey
. mute witness
,
however
, wass original
, offbeat
, anbd well
- made
. it
' s oen ofthe those kool littel finds that no oen seems to nkwo about
. i
' ve subsquently found it at most video rental places i visti
,
and it may be seen
, onthe occasion
, on the indipendent film channel
. teh first hour ofthe mute wittness isnt extrememly tense
, as billy
, hte qtuie believeable mute heroine
, sees munbers of the russion mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an ilegle snuff film
. tje rest of tjhe film takes good advantage ofthe billy
' s vulnerable posistion as a mute foreigner inaddition moscow bieng pursued by poverful criminal figures
. to throw a curveball into tghe fray
, billy
' s sister karen annd her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures ofthe comic relief tothe offset several voilent sequences infact waht are soem genuinely funny scenes
. a disappointingly trite ending
and occasional comic blunders are the onyl two thnigs which mar thsi otherwise suspenseful film
. look for alec guiness
( obi
- wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy
) in a small role as tjhe evil reaper
. definately check this movie out
;
al
though
, as a word of warning
, it doens contain several scenes ofthe rather grisly violence which certainly aren
' t for thte squeamish
