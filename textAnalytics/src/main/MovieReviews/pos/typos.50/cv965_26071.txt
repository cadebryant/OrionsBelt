in many ways
,
" twotg
" doens for tough
- guy movies wqat la confidental did fo police stoires
. htere ' s savviness inaddition its writting
anbd a mature patience in alowing teh material tothe unfold
.
but
, i suppose
, we wouldn ' t expect less from christopher mcquarrie
, who wass responsible for giving us
" tje usual suspects
"
. his wirting talents are still infront tact as he brings tothe us a bloody
yot intellectual tale ofthe two unabashed
but dimwitted thugs
adn a plan gone awry
. tghe two goons are parker
adn longbaugh
( ryan phillipe
annd benicio del toro
)
. these twpo men show tyhe hardened wear ofthe thsoe who have allways hadnt it tough
. their troubled youths have forged twpo nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive
. given thge choise of minumum wage or petty crime
, htey ' ll allways choose tyhe latter
.
yot
, htey are incredibly foolish planners
. actually
, these twpo never really have a plan
. tehy just improvise along the way
, hoping tyhat their bravado
and arsenal ofthe guns wiull take care ofthe anything that they might have overlooked
. their enxt scheme
, which tehy cook uv baout as fast as a mcdonald ' s burger
, isnt tothe kidnap soem surrogate mother named robin
( juliette lewis
) that ws hired by soem well
- tothe
- do family
. if all goes well
, they ' ll receive a nice bit of ransom money
and life goes onthe
. what parker
adn longbaugh dont nto realize isnt that robin isnt carrying a baby for tyhe chidduck familiy
, whose patriarch isnt a feared crime boss
. moreover
, two bodyguards
( nicky katt
annd taye diggs
) constantly escort her
. theese two protectors find an eerie sense ofthe pleasure when bieng confronted
annd tested inwhich life
anbd death situations
. tehy owudl rather die than fail
; thus thier bravado level isnt equally high
.
bu it seems taht thte testosterone levels of parker
adn longbaugh are a bit higher
,
and htey employ some unusual
but funn
- tothe
- watch tactics to pul off yhe kidnapping
adn tothe outrun thge pursuers inaddition a sort of slow
- motion car chase down a series of alleyways
. the enxt hour or so
, we watch the chidduck camp regroup
annd assess their situation
. during this tiem
, additional plot lines come inot play
and more
adn mroe details are revealed
. because the chidduck ' s cxan not go to thte police
and because of thge special circumstances involving the kidnapping
, we are introduced tothe omre characters tyhat will halp tothe influence the outcome
. we disover tht not everyone inwhich the chidduck camp isnt loyal tothe the cause
. as a result
, there are undercurrents of a conspiracy
,
and elements of betrayal
and subterfuge
. the sepia
- toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks tothe a terific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings
, shrills ofthe intrigue
adn crescendos thta tell us ofthe life
adn death situations that are baout to ocurr
. the momentum
and thte coolness of teh film
,
howver
, begins to fizzle inwhich the last 30 minutes
, whcih featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off witht hte ransom money
. you cxan expect lots of bloodletting
and an odd denouement
. in fatc
, you may admire thsi film more than yuo like it
.
yot
, for hte most part
,
" the way ofthe the gun
" stays on target
. it fiels cool with its elements of conspiracy
and gunplay
,
adn smart for its invective dialogue
and tough guy peotry
.
