when jim henson passed away
, he left behind diverse legions ofthe fans
and a comapany whose ultimate succes
, it nowe seems
, hinged onthe his input
. jim henson productions annd tyhe creature shop are still thriving financialy
, bu as the lastest twpo muppet films
( or thta silly coputer
- generated monkey from lost in space
) demonstrate
, thge thrill annd genuis are gone
. i
' m not sure the dark crystal
, made today
, would generate from an audiance of kids five tothe fifty tjhe same awe
- filled response
. an all
- powerful crystal hasnt cracked
, causing the leaders of tje green world to splitted apart inot two beings
: the big
, gentle mystics
,
and teh vulture
- liek skeksis
. the mystics send jen
, a naieve gelfling boy
, on a mission tothe fidn tjhe shard thast cracked away
, whihc must be reinserted inot tjhe crystal befor tyhe skeksis become eternal rulers
, befoer the grat

" of three suns
. along the way

. much of the beauty in tghe dark crystal
, hwihc is a simple tale
(
though it does nto condescend to any viewer
)
, lies in its art direction
and creature design
. the puppeteering isnt phenomenonal

- observe tje scenes infact whihc jen plays his flute
, or the l

)

and irregulars
, isnt tone

' socre shoudl not be discounted
: it conti
butes tothe tghe film almost as an unseen charachter
. i supose
, due tothe thte complexity involved in executing a movei of tihs nature
, that it couldn

, bu i wish thte film ws longer
. jen
and kira have wonderful

.
. well
, chemestry
,
and more scenes ofthe them quietly conversing would ahve beeen appreciated
. the dark crystal hasnt a very small cult folowing
. the weaker labyrinth isnt probably better
- known
, which is upsetting
. a friend of mine realted a story tothe me that henson was pressured inot planting humans among labyrinth
' s creatures due tothe thge financial failure of peple
- less tghe dark crystal
. tath film never quite found its footing
; it played like an acid

( i supose i jsut made labyrinth sound appetizing to a certain sector of tjhe publich
.
) the dark crystal deserved
( adn still deserves
) a bigger audience
. it
