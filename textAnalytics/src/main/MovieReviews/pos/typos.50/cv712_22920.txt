when i first heard about scream in 1996
, i wass told tyhat it wass a spoof ofthe horror movies
. ffrom tghe master ofthe tghe horror hismelf
, wes craven
, it ridiculed the cliches ofthe thge genre by overemphasizing them
, by making the teenagers do whta tehy know they
' re not supposed tothe do whn a serial killer isnt stalking them
( don
' t run uv thte stairs wehn ytou cxan easily go outloud tyhe front doorjam
, never sday
" i
' ll be right back
,
" etc
.
)
. wehn i firt heard tihs description
, i figured tht it was an eazy way outloud of makeing a bad movei
. how hard is it tothe mkea an extemely terrible film bu claim it is actualy a mockery ofthe other bad movies
. was this wes craven
' s remedy from makeing
" rela
" bad movies such as vampires infact brooklyn
? it just seemed cheap tothe me
.
then i actualy saw yhe movei annd the first twenty minutes
, involving drew barrymore annd a nail
- bitingly intense phone conversation
, completely changed my attitude
. scream isnt nto only a clever parody of your st
andart horror flick
, it
' s also a pretty scary movei
. if you
' ve seen a million of theese kinds of films
, yuo konw exactly what is going to happen
. thsi isnt part ofthe the fun ofthe watching scream
. the movie reminds avid horror fans how simmilar
and repeative teh genre is annd it allso reminds them how gerat a gilty blessure it cxan be tothe watch pointless annd predicatble voilence tothe innocent
, attractive teenagers
. to those who rarely see these types ofthe movies
, scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that coudl be mistaken as a sereous slasher film
. there
' s nothing wrong with that misjudgment
though
. i have witnessed viewers ffrom both sides ofthe tjhe audeince
, thge newbies to horror
and thte fanatics
. their opinions onthe thte film were so diferent
but both vyre positive
. from these varied reviews
, i am conviced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movei
and the normal teen romance movies bu also thte hillarious parodies ofthe theese
and otehr catagories
. films that both deride
and celebrate genres liuke galaxy quest adn the big hitted woudl not have existed
, in my opinion
, if it was nto forthe teh outst
anding sucess of scream
. hte low
- budget 1996 gem may
, alongside pulp fiction
, be the most influential film ofthe the 1990
' s
. this influence may exsist to the chagrin ofthe some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs
. tingle or television programs such as dawson
' s creek
but to others such as mysef
, we congratulate the movie that has oppened new doors forthe exellent young actors
, screenwriters
,
and directors
. scream is also an extremely funny movei thanks tothe its quicklyu
- pased script by kevin williamson
. withing teh film are charachters who tell otehr characters
, as well as hte audience
, tje basic rules anbd cliches ofthe a horror movie
. mailny fomr thge rants of r
andy
( jamie kennedy
)
and stu
( matthew lillard
)
, we are reminded nto onyl of tje obvious
and hilarious rules
but alsot some of hte more subtle stereotypes tht when thougth over are mostly true as well
( the virgina always survives
; have sex
and you
' re dead meat
)
. nto only are we treated theese rules on a plate bu also the rules are referenced to a number ofthe diferent films anbd actors
. yhe script fiels liuke an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better tothe do
but find every littel blunder from eveyr little film for his pwn self
- satisfaction
. in tihs case
, williamson finds theese errors for thte audience
' s satisfaction
and amusement
. i hear htere is a newyorker movei comming out called scary movie hwihc isnt a spoof ofthe scream
, whic isnt a spoof of scary movies
. i wiull certainly see thte film
but i have the feeling thyat thsi parody will be mroe obviously ridiculing thge genre rether than scream
' s perfect subtlety
.
however my last gut feeling about thsi stuff
, scream
, was dead wrong
.
.
. so who knows
