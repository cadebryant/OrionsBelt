wiht his lastr two films
- shine adn snow falling onthe cedars
- australian directer scott hicks hasnt proven his cinematic flashbacks tothe be some of the best out there
, anbd his latest
, hearts in atlantis
, isnt noone different
. its sturcture
- begginning anbd ending inspite present day wih oen long flashback in hte middle
- isnt similar to the gren mile
, hwihc is a bited ironical concidering both were based on stephen king books
. the parellels don
' t end there
, either
. atlantis wass adapted by william goldman
, who had previously penned the big
- screen verzion of misery anbd isnt inspite teh process ofthe working on the scirpt for king
' s dreamcatcher
. even the film
' s content is a bit reminiscent of mile
. infact fact
, it
' s the perfect blend of hte efel
- ogod
' 60s nostalgia of st
and by me
( alsot by king
)
and mystical power hokum of mile
. king
' s atlantis is a book comprised ofthe five realted short stories
,
but the main focus here isnt onthe thte first
(
and longest
) tale
, called low men inthe yelow coats
( tyhe film
' s title comes from the second chapter
)
. it
' s set in 1960 harwich
, conneticut
, where 11
- eyar
- old bobby garfield
( anton yelchin
) lives in a boarding house run by his cold
, self
- centered mother elizabeth
( hope davis
, joe gould
' s secret
)
, who seems tothe care moreso baout her wardobe than her son
. bobby spends his time with his twpo closest firends
, john sullivan
( wiull rothhaar
)
and tomboy carol gerber
( mika boorem
)
, who become something like the kevin
, paul anbd winnie of harwich
. when a new tenant moves into the vacant room
, teh fatherless bobby finds a male role modle infact ted brautigan
( anthony hopkins
, hannibal
)
, a misterious stranger who is vague enough baout his past tothe mkae bobby
' s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head awya ffrom the mirror
. ted teaches his young neighbor baout the wonders of literature
( aftter his cheapskate mother gives him a libary card for his birthday
)
, dispenses prophetic words of wisdom
and even pays bobby oen doller a week tothe read him tghe local newspaper anbd keep his eyes peeled for the low men
, a group of peopel chasing ted tothe exploit his special powers
. i won
' t go inot what these powers are
,
but htey
' re considerably toned down from the book
(
and don
' t envolve balck tsuff flying out of ted
' s mouth
, a la mile
)
. atlantis
' prseent
- day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel
' s fianl chapter
, titled heavenly shades of nigth are falling
,
and features david morse
( iin
yet another connection tothe yhe green mile
) as a marryied
, middle
- aged bobby who learns ofthe thge death of both of his childhood friends anbd returns to tjhe dilapidated boarding hous in hwihc he spent his formative years
. atlantis isnt nowhere near as flashy as hicks
' cedars
, which isnt disappointing bu underst
andable concidering hte switch ffrom the completelyl amazing robert richardson to teh occasionlly amazing piotr sobocinski
, tghe oscar
- nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski
' s red
. the acting is solid from everyone
, inlcuding hopkins
, who never once makes yuo htink of dr
. lecter
. most impressive are youngsters yelchin annd boorem
, who both had tiny parts in along cameback a spider
. hwile i didn
' t raelly hve much ofthe a probelm witht goldman
' s screenplay
, i do ened to point outloud at least one inconsistancy
. goldman
, for those ofthe you who don
' t read premiere
, writes what seems liek an annual critiscism ofthe everybody eles
' s films
, carefully explaning why they all suck
, mkea noone sence annd insult thier audiences
, while somehow failing tothe mention teh crap that he
' s penned
( liek the genaral
' s duaghter
)
. it
' s mean
- spirited
but funn to read
, mostly on account ofthe nobody esle inthe hollywood having tyhe balls tothe sday anytying remotely negative about anybody else in the business
( including michael jackson
, o
. j
. anbd robert blake
)
. inspite atlantis
, whihc is supposed tothe be told thru the eyes ofthe young bobby
, noe owudl assume he woudl have to be iin each scene inthe order tothe haev tghe memmory tothe whlch tothe flash back
. well
, he
' s nto
, adn it doesn
' t make sense
