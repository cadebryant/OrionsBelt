whith his lastest twpo films
- shine
anbd snow falling on cedars
- austrailian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks tothe be some ofthe teh best out there
,
and his latest
, hearts in atlantis
, is noone different
. its structer
- beginning
and endig infact present day wtih oney long flashback in the middle
- is similar to the green mile
, whic is a bited ironic considering both were based on stephen king books
. tghe parrallelly don ' t end htere
, either
. atlantis ws adapted by william goldman
, who hadnt previously penned tyhe big
- screen version ofthe misery
annd isnt infront the proces of working onthe teh scirpt for king ' s dreamcatcher
. even the film ' s content isnt a bited riminicent of mile
. in fact
, it ' s the perfect blend of thte fiel
- good ' 60s nostalgia ofthe stand by me
( allso by king
)
adn mystical power hokum ofthe mile
. king ' s atlantis isnt a book comprised ofthe five realted short storie
,
bu thge main focus here isnt on the first
(
annd longest
) tale
, called low men in yellow coats
( the film ' s title comes ffrom teh second chapter
)
. it ' s set inwhich 1960 harwich
, conneticut
, where 11
- eyar
- ood bobby garfield
( anton yelchin
) lives in a boarding hous run by his cold
, self
- centered mother elizabeth
( hope davis
, joe gould ' s secret
)
, who seems tothe care omre about her wardrobe thna her son
. bobby spends his tyme with his two closest friends
, john sullivan
( will rothhaar
)
and tomboy carol gerber
( mika boorem
)
, who become something liuke tjhe kevin
, paul
and winnie ofthe harwich
. when a new tennant moves into the vacent room
, tje fatherless bobby finds a male role modle in ted brautigan
( anthony hopkins
, hannibal
)
, a mysterous stranger who is vague enough about his past to mkea bobby ' s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head awya from hte mirror
. ted teaches his young neighbor about teh wonders ofthe liturature
( affter his cheapskate mother gives him a libary kard fo his birthday
)
, dispenses prophetic words ofthe wisdom
and even pays bobby one dollar a week tothe read him hte local newspaper
anbd keep his eyes peeled for the low men
, a gropu ofthe people chasing ted tothe exploit his special powers
. i won ' t go into what theese powers are
,
bu they ' re considerably toned down from tyhe book
(
annd don ' t envolve black tsuff flying outloud ofthe ted ' s mouth
, a la mile
)
. atlantis ' present
- day setting whihc bookends tje film is based on tghe novel ' s fianl chapter
, titled heavenly shades of nght are falling
,
anbd features david morse
( inwhich
yet anohter conection to the gren mile
) as a marryied
, middle
- aged bobby who lerans ofthe the death ofthe both ofthe his childhood firends
and returns tothe tyhe dilapidated boarding house inspite which he spended his formative years
. atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks ' cedars
, which is disappointing
bu understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson tothe hte occasionaly amazing piotr sobocinski
, the oscar
- nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski ' s red
. tghe acting isnt solid fomr everyone
, inlcuding hopkins
, who never once mkaes you think of dr
. lecter
. most impressive are youngsters yelchin
and boorem
, who both had tiny parts in allong came a spider
. while i didn ' t realy have much of a problem with goldman ' s screenplay
, i do ened tothe point out at least oen inconsistancy
. goldman
, forthe thsoe of ytou who don ' t read premiere
, writes whta seems like an annual criticism of everybody eles ' s films
, carefully explaining why they all suck
, make noone sence
and insult their audiences
, hwile somehow failing tothe mention the crap that he ' s penned
( like tyhe general ' s daughter
)
. it ' s mean
- spirited
bu funn tothe read
, mostly onthe account ofthe nobody esle inspite hollywood having the balls tothe sday anytying remotely negative about anybody esle inthe yhe bussiness
( including michael jackson
, o
. j
.
and robert blake
)
. infront atlantis
, whihc is suposed tothe be told through the eyes of young bobby
, one owudl assume he owudl have to be in eahc scene infact order tothe have the memory to which to flash bakc
. well
, he ' s not
,
annd it doesn ' t make sense
