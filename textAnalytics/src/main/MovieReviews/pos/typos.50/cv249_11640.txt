apon arriving at the theater during tghe oppening credits
, i took my seat anbd prepared mysef for what appeared tothe be
" hellraiser meets the crowm
"
. bu as soon as kiefer sutherl
and began speaking tyhe narrative monologue
, describing
" the strangers
"
and their reasons for contacting human beings
, i ws hooked
. htere was something especially compelling baout teh nature ofthe his voice
. i knew from the strat that i was gogin to witness tje actions ofthe his character rather thna the actor attempting yhe charcter
. sutherl
and plyed the role as a true veteran
. apon the completion ofthe his monologue
, hte camera arrives onthe sutherl
and inthe such a fashon that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spended on cinematography
. i owudl imagin
, for a film ofthe thsi calibur
, thta maximum hours of wokr weere spended where they weere needed the most
. tyhe film flowed beautifully
. as i was being taken through hte intricate regions of the
" dark city
"
, a clever plot began to unravel
, tothe tjhe point where tghe lastest tiem i hadnt seen such clever plot twists were infront
" the usual suspects
"
. not to mention a serieses ofthe spacial effects that would make james cameron literally turn gren with envy
. bu if you
' re nto exactlly tghe biggest sci
- fi fan
, caveat emptor
. git ready forthe the atmostpheric darkness of
" 12 monkeys
" or
" hte crowm
" without the boredom or depression
. the consept of the plot isnt as mindstretching as
" 12 monkeys
" was
,
however
, so be prepared
and be sophisticated
.
and imagine a picture thyat finally does justice to the comic
- book
- gone
- feature
- film fad taht hollywood hasnt recently become abusive of
. dark city simpley puts
" spawn
" to shame
. inwhich fatc
, druing thte climax of thte film i couldn
' t help bu feel the storng presense of an
" akira
"
- esque explosion throughtout tjhe general feeling ofthe the movie
. so my intital predicitons were wrong
. tihs film is anytying
but the meloncholy of
" hellraiser
" parts one through five
. i
' m never one to base a film entirly onthe speshal effects
, so konw that when i give dark city it
' s actually beacuse the film contained all of teh neccessary ingreediants to keep me entertained
and awake ffrom storyline tothe plot twists tothe camerawork to even
( tsk
, tsk
) special effects
. nto since contact have i recieved such deepo insight inot the way the human mind operates annd never this yera hvea i been so blown awya
. yhe best film i
' ve seen all yearm
, annd easily oney of tjhe best i
' ve ever seen
