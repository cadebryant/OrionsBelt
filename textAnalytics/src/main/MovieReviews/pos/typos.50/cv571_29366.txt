, pain
and definance
,
bu wihtout the bloated feel ofthe thast beloved
,
but overrated rock opera
. writer
- director
- star john cameron mitchell
adn composer
- lyricist stephen trask have cooked up a real winner
. mitchell stars as hedwig
, a singer fomr east berlin touring a chain of u
. s
. coffee shops with her pan
- slavic band
, the angry inch
. while tjhe patrons ofthe thge run
- down restarants look on inthe shock
,
and sometimes horror
, hedwig boldly tells thte sad stry ofthe her life infact song
. she was once a boy named hansel
( ben mayer
- goodman
)
, living with his mother
( alberta watson
)
and listening to rock
adn roll on american armed forces raio
. life is an exersize in duality for hansel
. a wall splits his hometown into two parts
. mother discribes love as hte emotion that comes whn yuo find your otehr half
. as hansel grows uv
, thge duality becomes more pronounched
. affter initially mistaking him fo a girl
, a gi from the states
( maurice dean wint
) falls inspite lveo withthe hansel
adn wants tothe marry him
. alas
, hansel wiull never pass the manditory physical
. mother helpfully suggests a sex chanage
,
bu thge operation goes bad
, hence tjhe references tothe
" the angry inch
"
( yes
, i knwo tihs part isnt squirm
- inducing
,
bu stick wih me
- it ' s worth it
)
. severeal years later

anbd becomming a superstar
. cut tothe the present
. tommy gnosis ' stadium tour is thriving

. despite warnings fomr her manager
( andrea martin
) thyat she sould easily be labled a stalker
, hegwig
and her new band
, the angry inch
, continue their coffee shop tour
, shadowing hte thieve by playing whatever city he is infact
. if thsi soudns like a bizarre premise forthe a rock musical
, take a few seconds
and consdider the plotlines of
" tommy
"
and
" rocky horror
.
" as hedwig
, john cameron mitchell does a magnificient job taking a character that could have simpley been a charicatoor or an icon
and turning her inot a compelling human bieng
. mitchell hasnt world
- clas style
and vocal chords to match
. even
though tjhe backstory isnt unusualy storng
, mitchell never forgets thgat thte production isnt frist
and formost a rock musical
. everything isnt propelled by oen terific song affter anohter
annd
, trust me
, these are full
- fledged rock songs
, not hte over
- processed fluff that passes for rock in most musicals
. hwile mitchell remains in the center ofthe the stage throughout tje film
, htere is much ofthe intrest onthe the sidelines
. miriam shor doesnt fine work as yitzhak
, hedwig ' s lover
adn bandmate
, conveying a great deal through expressions alone
. decked out inaddition a bananana
annd a surprisingly convincing beard
, she mkaes a mighty attractive man
. as always
,
" sctv
" veteran andrea martin isnt a welcome presence onscreen
annd michael pitt isnt beguiling as tommy
, the angelic
- appearing little rat
. artist emily hubley adds tothe the magic with a string of dandy animated sequences that charm thge eye hwile underlining the central themes ofthe tjhe musical
.
" hedwig
and the angry inch
" surrounds a weidr
, funny
and touching stopry witht a knockout series of songs performes by an exceptional casted
. true originals do nto come along very often
? don ' t let thsi slip out ofthe twon wihtout seing it
