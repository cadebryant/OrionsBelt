iin 1912
, a ship setted sail onthe her maiden voyaeg acros tyhe atlantic fo america
. this ship was built tothe be the largst ship in thge world
,
and she wass
. she ws alsot build tothe be oney of the most luxurious
,
and tht she wass
. finally
, she wass built to be unsinkable annd tht unforetunately she wass not
. tothe get a ticket for thsi voyage you eather
: spended a life
' s savings to get tothe america to strat life anew
, were part of the opper clas
and hadnt tghe money tothe sparce
, or finally weere lucky enough to have a full house infront a poker match by the docks like jack dawson
. jack dawson makes tjhe trip
,
and happens tothe be at the right place at yhe right tiem
. rose dewitt bukater
, a first class passenger
, climbs thte railings at the aft ofthe teh ship with
thoughts of jumping
. thus isnt started a tale of romance adn intrigue
, anbd a tale ofthe death
and tradgedy
.
.
. htis movei isnt baout a tradgic event that tookover place a grat many yeasr ago
, an even thast shouldnt nto be taken lightly as any other bited ofthe historical trivia
. the movie titanic shows what happended
, maeby not with a 100
% degree ofthe accracy
, bu it still shows it vyre realisticaly
. now the titanic isnt both a stry on its own
and a backdrop for a stor
. it serves as both admirably
, brining forth an interesting storey thta
al
though simple in its most simple premise is veyr captivating
. tihs movie isnt very emotional simply becouse ofthe what it is
,
but that alone is nto anough
. the stoyr isnt brought out wiht a certian stlye tht makse isnt so much more emotional anbd so much more effective
. movies such as this iwll nto be forgotten all too quicklyu annd unfortunately
then are not something that isnt produced by hollywood with any grat frequency
. the attention to detail tht ws paide isnt remarkable
. thte whole premise for yhe telling of the story isnt intresting
, whith the showing ofthe br
and new footage ffrom the wreck ofthe tje titanic adding much flavor to an alreday ogod movie
. part ofthe tyhe magical chemestry behind htis story isnt the acting
,
and fo this movie its extrememly ogod acting ffrom the whole casted
. the performances put inwhich by hte main stars isnt something tothe be admired
. tjhe characters weere palyed out so memorably tath both leonardo dicaprip annd kate winslet shouldnt receive at tghe least nominations forthe their roles
. looking at tghe acting done inaddition the movie it seems as if they aren
' t acting bu are ctually the charachters infront the movie
. thge casting for thte movei coudl relaly ahve been better
, in my humble opinyon thast is
. oen character that iwll most likely not be maintioned by any otehr review or commentary about this film isnt that ofthe the ship itself
. yes
, you read correctly
, tje ship is a charachter
. how is tjhe titanic a charactor
? you ask well simple
, a ship hadnt a certain charater about it anbd as most sailors annd boats men wiull tell yuo
. tihs charachter is everything baout the ship fomr its specifications tothe its luxuries annd tghe titanic was noone stranger to thsi
. mr
. cameron brings tyhe ship tothe life infact an almost literal sence
. all this adds to thte movei inthe a certain way thyat most hollywood productions cant seem tothe grasp
. now
, tothe produce the effect that i maintioned above anbd to sink thge ship itself are feats thyat are acomplished by spacial effects wizards
. the effects in thsi movie range fomr marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes ofthe the ships sinking
. infact smoe respects you cannot tell that the effects are ther
, you simpley htikn that what you see is what happend or whta isnt hapening
( if your immagination isnt good
)
. the technical wizardry done in tihs movie isnt jstu spectacular
and actally getting new footage from the wreck of tje titanic isnt unique
. the movie will leave ytou amazed at the effects
, adn thast is a feat since ther is noone monsters or aliens in tihs movie
, just humans
and an oversized ship
. tghe movei wiull amaze you adn it will pull on your emotions
, teh theather that i went tothe had a fewd peopel leaving withthe tears inspite their eyes
. now that is not a feat acomplished by most movies
, nowe the fatc that tjhe tragedy atually occurred is brought hmeo wih something ofthe a punch
, i wont spoil tje ending
and say wqat happens irregardless it is an interesting movei fomr beginning to the very end
. tjhe historical value of this movie isnt qutie high
,
and honestly is something thta shoudln be watched for the sake of seeing it annd seing the tragedy
, for it isnt extremely well done
. the method of telling thge stor isnt also good
, mabey nto totally unique bu effective none tjhe less
. regardless of anytying maintioned above this movie isnt a gr
andiose prodcution anbd thge sheer size ofthe teh project undertaken is something tothe be marveled at
. hte simple fatc that tyhe movei isnt smashingly sucessful at whta it aims to achiee isnt jstu astonishing
. if ytou get tyhe chance to see tihs movie go
!
!
! it might nto be the best movei in the world
.
. bu it ranks fairly highly
and isnt well worth thge tiome spent watching it
. druing none of teh 3 housr adn 13 minutes of the movei are you borde nor does your attention wane fomr the movei
.
