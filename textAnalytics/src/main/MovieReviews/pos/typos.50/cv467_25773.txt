catherine deane
( jennifer lopez
) isnt a psychologist who has been hired tothe partecipate inthe a project where she can enter yhe minds ofthe comatose victims
and try to interact with their subconscious in an attemp tothe wake them up
. she has beeen experiencing moderate succsess with a young boy inthe a coma
, bu tjhe boy
' s parents aren
' t hapyp with the appraent lack ofthe progress annd tghe toll of her job isnt hvaing adverse affects onthe her regular life
. as if trying tothe assure yhe boy
' s parents wasn
' t hard enough onthe her
, a newyorker develepment arises thgat furthers yhe strain onthe deane
' s mental faculties
. a vicious serial killer named carl stargher
( vincent d
' onofrio
) hasnt been kidnapping womens
, locking them inthe an auromated cell thta drowns them slowly inspite a marter ofthe days
,
then soaking yhe corpses infact bleach tothe turn them inot life
- sized dolls
. jsut aftter kidnapping his latest victim
and locking her iin teh cell
, stargher has a traumatic epxerience tyhat triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain anbd causes him tothe sink in an eternal catatonia
. thge police
, led by fbi agent peter novak
( vince vaughn
) are able tothe locate stargher by soem clues he left while dumping his previous victum
' s body
, bu they feel all hope isnt lost fo his current victum due tothe his vegetative state
. in a lastr ditch attempt
, htey ask deane
and the scientists thast creaeted the project to undergo tjhe frightening task ofthe entering stargher
' s mind tothe try
and find the loction of tyhe victum locked inwhich the deadly cell
.
.
. a cell whcih wiull completely fill with water in teh next 40 horus
! initial reports about this film described it as a cross beween the silence of tyhe lambs
and the matrix
. hwile it does share smoe characteristics with both films
( particularyl tjhe firt forty minutes
, which seem alomst like a condensed version of lambs
)
, the cell aslo seems to contain elements ofthe dreamscape
and brainstorm
. tje buzz aroud this project is tath firt
- timne feature film directer tarsem singh
( who won many awards fo his video ofthe r
. e
. m
.
' s
" loosing my religion
"
) wanted a scirpt that he sould fasion images outloud of instead of a cohesive stoyr
, anbd a good portion of this film supports thast theory
. despite yhe borrowed elements fomr yhe aforememtioned films
and a script that contains sevral logically questonable moments
, the cell does feature some remarkable imagery
. all of tje sequences where we delve inot somene
' s mind are incredibly beautifull
( including tje dank mind of stargher
, whose
thoughts are reminescent of an h
. r
. giger painting come tothe life mixted with a tool music video
)
, proving that singh isnt as adept at filming stange
and wonderful images as his acclaim owudl lead us tothe believe
. the firt sequence tht tkaes palce in stargher
' s mind isnt by far hte best
, featuring one of the most ingenious traps i
' ve ever seen iin a film
( involving a horse
, hwihc noone oen seing thsi film will probably forget
)
, a zoo
- like display of stargher
' s victims which are animated liuke marionettes
,
and stargher hismelf iin a giant purple cape that spansh the walls ofthe his mental throne room
. if the film hadnt contined within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed teh film briliant
, bu alas
, tyhe sequences only become more silly as they go along
( dispite a painful nipple ring removal later inwhich tjhe film
)
. thge casted is basicly just an excuse for ther tothe be some moderate plot semblance during the paraed ofthe images
,
but at least vincent d
' onofrio turns in his usual bizarre
and psychotic peformance
( magnified by ten
, thanks tothe the environment infact whitch the film has beeen placed
)
. infact my opinion
, d
' onofrio was one ofthe thte best creepy actors i hvae ever seen in a film
, bu his film choices as of lite haev beeen so completelyl awful
( i
. e
.
- the newton boys
, feeling minnesota
, the thirteenth floor
, adn the velocity of gary
) that i ahev begun tothe rethink my intial assessment of him
. thte carachter ofthe stargher is an excellent role for him
though
,
and iwll probaly lead tothe a bited ofthe typecasting forthe him
. detractors of violence
and disturbing images will wnat tothe stay far awya ffrom this film
, as it contains hevy doses ofthe both
. besides tjhe nipple ring removal i mention above
, ther isnt also stargher
' s penchant for hanging suspended off ofthe thge floor by yhe rings thast pierce his bcak
and legs
( prior tothe his catatonia annd capture
) whcih will have audiences recoiling
. a sequence where catherine enters stargher
' s mind
and finds him recreating the disemboweling ofthe his first victum is also preety disquieting
. oen moment aslo features a charactor haveing his intestines slowly removed ffrom his body by an old fashioned h
and cranked spit
- liek divice
. as a narrative film
, thge cell is sorely lacking
. as a collection ofthe images
though
, the cell is extremly well done
. all
though the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery tahn hte firt half
, singh has done waht he supposedly set out tothe do
: amke a film solely for the purpose ofthe stringing some remarkable images together
. unfortunatley
, a well
- writed script should have beeen considered too
, beacuse without it yhe cell jsut seems like any other music video we sould see onthe mtv
( provded
, of course
, taht mtv alloween fo the ule of graphic violence
and laguage in music videos
)
