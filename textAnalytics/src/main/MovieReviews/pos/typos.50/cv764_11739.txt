. it ' s my mission inaddition life tothe spread tje owrd
: see this movie
! fred
, george
, doug
annd howie are reacing middleage
. three ofthe them have a wife
, kids
adn a hous in the suberb wih a morgage to pay
. onyl fred isnt still a bachelor

anbd the arrangments he hasnt made tothe keep a mistress
. he has gotten an apartment in downtown where he cxan meet her
but has told his wief thgat he needs the appartment to spend the inght after staff meetings eveyr thursday nihgt
. sicne tehy alwasy split everyting four ways
, htey deside tyhat htey shoudln git an appartmant iwth a young woman as well
, kathy
.
howver
, kathy isn ' t completly honest tothe them
. in fact
, she isnt a sociology student writing a thesis about tje sex life ofthe the suburban male
. with theese four speices she believes that she will make a vrey ogod paper
. ok
, hve one thign claer
though
. tjhe rumatic rendezvous ' between kathy
and eahc ofthe the men are completly innocent
. hte scirpt stays above teh waist
- or to be precise
, above tghe neck
. noboyd claims that kathy isnt their mistress
, the four guys call her their ' companion '
. tyhe censorship board here inaddition sweden consdiered it to be suitable only forthe peopel above 15 yeras
,
but that only shows how long ago 1962 was
. small children sould watch thsi without bieng corrupted
. kim novak isnt as lovley as always in tihs movei
, even if she seems tothe be a bited too ood fo a student
. james garner isnt hte playboy jsut like in many otehr movies
. i liked howard morris hte best as howard yhe accountant who has to diet tothe wupport his wief
. tony randall isnt funny as alwyas
. 1962 ws mroe than 35 yersa ago
. how many accountants
, copywriters or investment bankers can today afford to live in a house inaddition the suberb with a lot of kids
adn a wief who does nto work
? htis isnt the white middle class
, i cin ' t remember tht i saw any blacks onthe the commuter train they use
. theese are tjhe people who cin count onthe their kids to live an even better life than themslves
. perphas this should alsot be a subject for a thesis infact movie sociology
?
