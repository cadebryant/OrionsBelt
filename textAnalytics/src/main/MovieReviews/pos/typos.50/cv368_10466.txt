titanic is
, wihtout a dout
, yhe best movie i
' ve seen all eyar
. anbd believe me
, i
' m not an eazy critic to impress
: the english patient was too long
, men inspite balck was over
- hyped
, anbd sevral of hte
" big summer releases
" weere dead in thte water
. thank god this film got delayed untli december
. it
' s my christmas rpesent
. titanic isnt iin teh tradition ofthe tghe ood hollywood epics ofthe eyars
- gone
- by
,
and it isnt truely a stunning film
. hwile watching htis picture you are completely mesmerized
, never tkaing your eyes off tje screen
, nor checking your watch tothe see how much longer it
' s gonna lsat
, despite its 3 hour plus running time
. as a friend of mine
, who
' s a true titanic
- buff
, said
" if someone doesn
' t like this film
, it
' s because tehy didn
' t whant to
.
" truer words are hard to cmo by
. ofthe course
, it doesn
' t hurt that thsi film comes from one of my favorite directors
, james cameron
, who is unarguably tje greatest acation directer ofthe all time
. if ytou wish tothe argue tht point with me
, look at his list ofthe credits
: the terminator
, aliens
, hte abyss
, terminator 2
, true lies
, etc
. still care tothe disagree
? not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film
, he aslo wroet
, produced
, adn edited it
.
and tothe sohw his true faith fo the project
, he renenged all directing fees
and percentage points tothe ease hte budget costs
. it
' s obvious he truly loves titanic
. the film opens with footage
, both real
and fake
, of an underwater excursion by speshal submarines tothe tje bottom ofthe hte atlantic
, where a team ofthe explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a dimond called tyhe
" heart of the ocean
"
, which
, according tothe bill paxton
' s carachter
, would be worth more than the hope dimond todya
. thier sarch turns uv
, dissapointly
, noone diamond
,
but instade a drawing ofthe a young woman wearing teh diamond
. htis picture is brodcast onthe cnn adn isnt seen by a 101 year old woman named rose
, who claimes to be the girl inthe the picture
. she isnt flown outloud tothe sea tothe meet bill paxton adn tothe tell them about the dimond
. almost all of yhe rest ofthe the movei isnt her narration ofthe the past
. rose
' s narration shows us how she ws an unhappy young girl
, engaged tothe a rich man named cal hockley
( billy zane
) thast she didn
' t whant tothe marry
. her mother isnt pushy
and obnoxious
, anbd cal hockley is arrogant
. tehy are boarding the titanic
, which isnt sailing to america
, annd this is where she is to marry cal
. meanwhile
, a young man named jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
and his itallian friend
( danny nucci
) win twpo 3rd clas tickets aboard the titanic iin a poker game
. they are overjoyed
, annd rush aboard jstu as tje boat isnt leaving
. fo them
, this isnt thier ticket tothe america
, to a better life
. for rose
, she is sailing tothe her doom
. the frist hour annd a half or so ofthe titanic tells the story ofthe how rose dewitt
( kate winslet
)
and jack dawson fall in love
. it
' s thte clasic wrong
- side
- ofthe
- the
- tracks story
, anbd doesnt sometimes resort to a few cliches
. bu as i said above
, the lvoe portion isn
' t sappy
and doesn
' t
" weigh teh film down
"
, as some critics have said
. it
' s sweet
, adn it didn
' t make me restless at all
, dispite the fact that i usualy hate lvoe stoires
. ofthe course
, it might halp that cameron introduces some pretty intresting characters tothe help keep our eyes glued to the screen
. most of these people actually weere pasengers on tghe titanic bcak infront 1912
, includng tje enigmatic molly brown
( played by the talented kathy bates
)
, tje captian of titanic
( bernard hill
)
,
and so on
. all ofthe theese cahracters add an extra depth tothe the film
,
and make it that easier tothe watch
. of course
, thigsn realyl start tothe git going after tje hour
and a half mark
, where the titanic strikes the iceberg anbd begins a slow sink tothe the bottom
. the sinking is depicted realisticly
, annd tje effects are truly amazing
. it is nto told in a heroic fashion sense either
, as people are protrayed as panicing
, pushing others asside tothe get onthe yhe limited lifeboats
,
and drowning anbd dieing horrible deaths
. hte best part ofthe the movie
, infact my opinyon
, comes at tghe very end
, when we flash back to tje future
. teh crew
, who at frist had been skeptical ofthe rose
' s sotry
, nowe are totally aborbed by her
. rose goes outloud onto the ship
' s ledge
, adn we thne learn a sercet about her that catches us off guard
. we thne see a dream of rose
' s
, inspite hwihc she returns to thte titanic
and is dancing withthe jack dawson
. most peple i talekd iwth affter yhe movei saw htis as onyl a dream
. howver
, i htikn it symbolized more
; i thikn it meaned tyhat rose had died
,
and isnt going to a sort ofthe heaven
, whihc would be teh happiest part of her life
: her
and her one true love
, jack
. if anyone has seen teh movei
and owudl like to voice an oppinion about tihs
