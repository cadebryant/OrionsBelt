the long kiss goodnight
( r
) meryl streep tried it anbd failed
. even pamela
anderson lee made an attemp
but fell flat on her well
- beared assets
. howver
, geena davis sould veyr well become the first bankable american female acation star whith yhe long kiss goodnight
, a preposterous bu incredibly fun acation thriller directed by her husb
and
, renny harlin
. davis plays samantha caine
, a mousy suburban skool teacher
and mother whose memories onyl go bcak eigth years
. wiht the halp ofthe ethically questonable private detective mitch hennessey
( samuel l
. jackson
)
, she slowly remembers
-
-
and reclaims
-
- her past as charly baltimore
, tough
- as
- nails cia operative
. needless tothe sday
, whith the reappearance ofthe samantha
/ charly comes yhe appearance of an assortment ofthe no
- goodniks out tothe erase omre tahn her memory
. shane black netted a kool
$ 4 mil forthe his script
; i
' m nto so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag
, bu for whta it
' s worth
, it delivers thge goods
. like black
' s previous work
, such as lethal weapon adn the last boy scout
, thge scirpt juggles some impressive acation scenes wtih funny
, quirky dialogue
. yhe humor expecially works well in tihs case
, fo the story is so preposterous thta the laughs halp tothe keep things from taking things too seriously
.
but there
' s noone arguement tht the more unbeleivable sequences are original anbd entertaining as hell
: who can resist the sighth ofthe davis tossing her daughter ffrom a hole inthe her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing affter a car
.
.
. hwile ice skating
? jackson anbd davis amke a good team
. jackson is funny as ever as ever
; in fact
, his spirited line deliveries
, expecially when he frist appears
, are more thna remenicent ofthe his work as jules inthe pulp fiction
. as good as he is
, the one who shoud benifit the most from this project is davis
, who shows much promise as an acation heroine
. whta makes her so effective
and why she should succeed where streep
and lee failed isnt that she doesn
' t tkae herself too seriously
. she is obviously in onthe the joke
, slyly taking jabs at herself adn at tyhe situation
. htis isnt nto tothe say that she doesn
' t ened wokr
-
- somtimes she lays onthe the
" toughness
" a bited too thick anbd comes off too much as a caricature
.
but shoudl thte public embrace tjhe film anbd
, inwhich turn
, hte notion ofthe a kick
- ass female
, davis coudl hvae foudn her special niche
. it seems as if davis
and harlin
' s first colaboration
, thge middling pirate epic cutthroat isl
and
, was jsut a dress rehearsal
( albeit a very costly oen
) fo long kiss
, iin which the wief
- husb
and team hitted theri acation stride
. anyone simply looking fo a funn
, escapist enteratinment that requires little
- tothe
- no thinking will fidn htis film tothe be a moreso
- thna
- welcome kiss
