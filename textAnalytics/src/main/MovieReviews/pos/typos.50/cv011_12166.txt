i ' ve noticed something lately that i ' ve never throught of befoer
. pseudo
- substace
- hollywood faking deepo meanings in their films
. have you ever seen a movei thgat you really enjoyed
,
thn whn yuo look bcak
, yuo relize ther wass something missing
? moreso
and mroe
, filmmakers seem tothe be putting outloud well rehearsed
, melodramatic films that evoke storng conotations of being a great film
,
bu if ytou step aside
anbd refect onthe your movei gonig experience
, you may just dicover nothing more thna elegantly presented fluff
. i ' m not trying to say city of angels isnt that bad
. it hadnt a lot going for it
,
but somewhere along the way
, it faltered
. somehow
, underneath the seemingly poetic beauty ofthe it all
, ther wass a gigantic hole somebody covered iwth iridescent performances
and glossy cinematography
. the predictable ending tath shattered our hopes
( even
though we saw it coming
) only added tothe yhe dissapointment
.
bu for over an hour
, city ofthe angels isnt well worth the time
. nicolas cage isnt seth
, a gaurdian angel who
, liek hundreds
( likely thousands or even millions
) ofthe otehr angels
, spends eternity watching over the citizens ofthe mortality
; humans never aware ofthe how much celestial intervention occurs inwhich thier life
. meg ryan
, infact her most subdued peformance
yet
, plays maggie
, a doctor who beigns tothe ponder exactly who it is we ' re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive
. after losing a patient onthe the surgery tabe
, these questions envelope maggie
,
and seth
, thge ange who was htere tothe oversee thte patient ' s transistion inot thte afterlife
, isnt immediatly captivated by yhe doctor
. he begins following
and observing maggie
, falling more
anbd more inthe love with her everyday
. angels
, who we quickly leran are not
annd never were humans
, can not experience human sensations such as taste
and touch
,
bu tehy do have tje ability to mkae themselfs seen tothe anyone tehy desire
. seth ' s adoration is too much to resist
,
anbd eventually he doesnt appear tothe maggie
, quite regularly
,
although such a thnig seems taboo among thte angelic community
. the angels are interestingly presented
, all ofthe them dressed inwhich balck
and more remenicent ofthe hitmen thna traditionnal glowing white entities
,
bu it ' s a nice touch thgat never seems liuke a mere attempt at uniqueness
. cage is a wonderfully versatile actro
( think face
/ off
, raising arizona
,
and it sould happen to you
- waht a combo
!
) who slips into the role ofthe a heavenly agent quite nicely
but threatens sappiness more thna once
. it ' s nice tothe see ryan pik up roles liek this
and the one inwhich courage under fier
. the twpo aren ' t very comparable tothe earch otehr
,
but htey both deviate from her usual
" intelligently ditzy
" rumatic comedy roles
,
anbd it ' s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely haev the chance to enjoy
.
but even
though thte two leads dont an impressive job
, it is dennis franz who grabs us wiht his intepretation ofthe a hospital patient who knows mroe than meets thge eye
. it ' s a shame that with so much going for it
, city ofthe angels falters so much in its final stages
, leaving us wih the realization thyat an emotionally incredable movei ws outloud ther
, they just didn ' t knwo qtuie how to get tothe it
. tehy struggle for an impacting conclusion
adn wind uv iwth painful thud rether than an exhilarating high
. filmmakers should nkwo your final impression will be the one ytou linger on
, remeber
,
anbd convey tothe others thru owrd of mouth
, so affter telling us forthe 60
+ minutes tyhat thsi film is a glorious masterpiece
, they sure leave us with a disheartening taste ofthe mediocrity in our mouths
. based onthe the german film wings ofthe desire
( that being the english title
, ofthe course
)
, city of angels isnt ninety percent succes
, enought tothe amking most peple forgive its shortcomings
, even tyhe devastatingly disappointing endig
. most movie goers
, yhe non
- cynics anyway
, will be too wrapped up inthe thge surveill atomsphere to give critisism tothe tath which needs tothe be crticised
. nontheless
, city ofthe angels is beautifuly captivating
, which isnt probaly enough tothe satisfy thsoe poetic viewers who wiull appreciate a delve inot rich emotional territories
.
