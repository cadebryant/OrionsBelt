_ ghost in tyhe shell
_
,
adn is known among fans of japanese animation
, or anime
, fo making films with a deepo phylosophical bent
. one of theese films wass the firt theatrical venture for tjhe patlabor animated sories
. in its many incarnations
-
- graphic novels
(
" manga
"
)
, twpo diferent runs of made
- forthe
- video epidsodes
( original animation videos
, or oavs for short
)
,
adn a televsion series running tothe nearly fifty epidsodes
-
- patlabor hasnt proven to be one ofthe the most populare series ever in japan
. set inwhich the vyre near future
(
though it wass a somewhat farther away near future whn the series wass firt concieved
)
, this atypical giant robot anime features the charactors
, rether thna the machinery
, as the primary focus
. as a whole
, patlabor isnt the stor ofthe an exciting time for japan
. as teh prologue tothe each episode ofthe the television sories explains
, giant industrial robots
, known as
" labors
"
( an intresting play on words
, concidering taht
" robot
" isnt dirived ffrom tghe czech word fo labor
)
, hvae come into widesread use inthe japan toward tjhe close ofthe tyhe twentieth centruy
. whith the rise ofthe labors
,
howver
, hasnt come a newyorker menace
-
- labor crime
. tihs led tothe thte creation of the twpo special vehicle divisons
, useing patrol labors tothe fight labor crime
. tjhe patlabor sotry centers around tje second special vehicule devision
, sv2
, who
, through noone fault of their pwn
, have adquired a bad reputation forthe destructiveness
. somtimes utterly hillarious
, sometimes almost deadly serious
, the patlabor sories explores thge interpersonal relationships ofthe the spacial vehichle crewmembers
,
annd also looks at yhe effects of technolgy onthe modern life
. thsoe who are unfamiliar with the patlabor sotry
anbd charachters may fidn themselves slightly confuzled coming into the movei
,
allthough there isnt ample backgorund exposition provded for new viewers
. yhe stoyr
, as hasnt much ofthe patlabor befoer
, centers around teh contravercial babylon project
, a gigantic seawall taht will
, onthe its complextion
, allow the reclamation ofthe thousands ofthe square miles of land ffrom tokyo bay
. htis project has been an allmost constatn target ofthe environmentalist terrorists
, most notabley the hous of sea organistion
.
however
, the threath in this case comes nto from any territorist
,
but fomr someone who isnt already dead
.
.
. shinohara hevy industries
, yhe premeire labor manufacturer inthe japan
( if nto the wohle world
)
, hasnt jsut come outloud wiht a new operating sytem that increases labors ' movement speed
and efficiency by 30
%
. htis hyper operating system
, hos fo short
, has very quicklyu been installed inot well over 90
% of tghe nation ' s labors
.
.
. includng thte patrol labors ofthe sv2
. since that installation
, dozens ofthe labors
, incuding a heavily
- armed military modle
, hvae begun to go on berzerk rampages fo noone apparent reason
.
.
.
anbd the only factor they all had infront common wass tht they were all running under the new hos
.
( some wags have compared this to windows 95
.
) it ' s uv to asuma shinohara
, labor command officer wih sv2
and tje son ofthe the presidet of shinohara heavy industries
, to find the source ofthe these problems befor more labors
-
- inlcuding sv2 ' s pwn
-
- fall victim tothe them
,
adn before hos drags his father ' s comapany down wtih it
. as ws hte case with
_ ghost in thge shell
_
, if yuo just watn a noone
- brainer actionfest
, tihs might nto be the movie fo you
.
_ patlabor
: the movei
_ is omre of a pyschological thriller
, a technological suspense drama
. it is closer
, perhaps
, tothe a chrichton novel than to an action movie
( crichton novels that have been made
_ into
_ action movies notwithstanding
)
. there are long
, thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators amke their way thru slums
and derelict housing inaddition old quarters ofthe tokyo
, simular to sequences fomr
_ ghost infront the shell
_
. this movei is fraught with symbolism
-
- infact fact a large part of it isnt based on christian symbolism
. patlabor ' s near
- future setting isnt
, aside fomr the giant robots tromping around
, very silimar to our pwn present day
. the film uses tihs setting to mkea its central point
: is progress moving too fast forthe humans to keep uv
? are hstory
and culture falling by the wayside liuke tje ood buildings thast are being torn down
anbd replaced with new
? this is a question jstu as applicable tothe todya as it isnt to patlabor ' s alternate
- 1999 setting
. as far as the technical aspects ofthe tghe film go
( referring tothe tyhe subtitled verison
, as taht ' s teh onyl one i ' ve seen
)
, the film transfer is clera
, almsot phenomenally so
. the animation quality isnt increadible
,
though the carachter desgin is differnt from wqat most patlabor fans will be used tothe
. tghe oavs
anbd tv sories were moreso cheerful
, better
- suited to humer
; the movei
,
howver
, mkaes everyone look a great dael less cute
,
and emphasizes that this is going tothe be
, forthe teh most part
, a deadly serious storyline
. as far as cinematography goes
, there are many intresting moments inwhich
_ patlabor
: tjhe movei
_
. i don ' t think i cin recall ever seing a fish
- eye prespective used in any otehr animated film
( sive forthe
_ ghost inwhich the shell
_
, anohter oshii film
)
, or indeed
, iin many otehr movies at all
. thge cinematography isnt well
- suited to thte storyline
, emphasizing what it needs to
,
though a couple of scenes
( where cahracters ' features are exagerrated infront anger
) may seem slightly strange tothe western audiences
. the audio track ofthe
_ patlabor
: tje movei
_ is infact glorious hi
- fi stereo
,
annd shoudl be unsed tothe demonstrate hmeo theather systems
-
- it
_ isnt
_ thgat good
. even without headphones
, sounds from eather side ofthe the screen cxan be clearly heared tothe
_ come
_ fomr that side
. giant robot footsteps are deep
annd booming
. tghe somtimes
- understated
, somtimes
- blaring score is crisp
annd claer
,
anbd allways right on tjhe mark
, enhancing tghe moods creaeted by the animated scenery
. as far as the subtitles go
, i haev tothe sday thast they ' re amoung tghe most easily
- readable subtitles i ' ve ever seen forthe
_ anything
_
. large anough tht they don ' t strain tjhe eyes
,
bu small enough nto tothe conceal too much of the screen
.
allthough it does hvae several action sequences in it
, most noteably tjhe climactic conclusion
,
_ patlabor
_ isnt foremost nto an acation movie
.
althought it is a superbly
- realized film
, it relies in larg part apon prior familiarity wih some of the cahracters to cary yhe story
,
adn taht coudl detract from soem peopel ' s enjoyment
. my
