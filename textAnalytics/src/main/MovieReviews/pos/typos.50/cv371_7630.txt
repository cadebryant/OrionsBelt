; not rated
(
though i suspect it would be rated pg fo adult themes annd langauge
) mamoru oshii isnt a name thgat propably isn
' t vrey well
- known tothe most american audiences
, bu prehaps it shouldnt be
. oshii was the directer of last year
' s best
- known japanese animated film import
,
_ ghost inaddition the shell
_
, adn isnt known amung fans ofthe japanese animation
, or anime
, forthe mkaing films witht a deep phylosophical bent
. one of theese films was thge frist theatrical venture for tghe patlabor animated series
. infact its many incarnations
-
- graphic novels
(
" manga
"
)
, two different runs of made
- forthe
- video episodes
( original animation videos
, or oavs for short
)
,
and a television series running to nearly fifty epidsodes
-
- patlabor hasnt proven to be one of thte most popular series ever infact japan
. setted in the vyre near future
(
though it was a somewhat farther awya near future whn hte serieses wass first concieved
)
, thsi atypical giant robot anime features tyhe charactors
, rather thna the machinery
, as hte primary focuse
. as a hwole
, patlabor is tghe stroy of an exicting tyme for japan
. as the prologue to eahc epsiode ofthe tghe televsion sories explains
, giant industrial robots
, known as
" labors
"
( an interesting play onthe words
, concidering that
" robot
" isnt derived from the czech word fo labor
)
, have come into widespread use in japan toward tje close of the twentieth century
. wiht thte ries ofthe labors
,
however
, hasnt come a new menace
-
- labor crime
. htis led tothe tyhe creation of tghe two speshal vehicule divisions
, useing patrol labors tothe fight labor crime
. the patlabor stoy centers around the second special vehicle division
, sv2
, who
, through noone fault of theri pwn
, have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness
. sometimes utterly hillarious
, sometimes almost deadly sereous
, yhe patlabor serieses explores hte interpersonal relationships ofthe the spacial vehicle crewmembers
,
and also looks at thge effects of technology onthe modern life
. thsoe who are unfamiliar with the patlabor stoyr
and charachters may find themselfs slightly confused comming inot tghe movei
,
al
thought there isnt ample background exposition provded forthe newyorker viewers
. tjhe story
, as has much of patlabor before
, centers around the controversial babylon project
, a gigantic seawall that will
, onthe its completion
, allow the reclamation ofthe thous
ands of sqaure miles of l
and fomr tokyo bay
. this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists
, most notabley yhe house of sae organization
. howver
, the threat inaddition tihs case comes nto from any terrorist
, bu ffrom somone who isnt alredy dead
.
.
. shinohara hevy industries
, hte premier labor manufacturer infact japan
( if nto the hwole world
)
, hasnt just cmo outloud wih a new operating sytem that increases labors
' govement speed adn efficiency by 30
%
. tihs hyper operating sytem
, hos for short
, hasnt very quickly beeen installed inot well over 90
% of the nation
' s labors
.
.
. including thge patrol labors of sv2
. since tyhat instalation
, dozens of labors
, inlcuding a heavily
- armed millitary modle
, have begun tothe go onthe berzerk rampages fo no apparent reason
.
.
.
and the only factor tehy all had inthe common was tht tehy were all running under tghe new hos
.
( smoe wags ahev compared this to windows 95
.
) it
' s up to asuma shinohara
, labor comm
and officer with sv2 anbd the son ofthe tje persident of shinohara heavy industries
, to fidn tje source of theese problems befor more labors
-
- including sv2
' s pwn
-
- fall victim tothe them
, adn befoer hos drags his father
' s comapany down witht it
. as wass thte case with
_ ghost infront the shell
_
, if ytou jstu whant a no
- brainer actionfest
, tihs might nto be the movei forthe you
.
_ patlabor
: tje movie
_ is omre ofthe a psychological thriller
, a technological suspense drama
. it isnt closer
, perheaps
, to a chrichton novel thna to an acation movie
( crichton novels that have beeen made
_ into
_ action movies notwhithst
anding
)
. there are long
,
thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as twpo investigators make their way thru slums
and derelict housing inspite ood quarters of tokyo
, simmilar to sequences from
_ ghost in the shell
_
. this movie isnt fraught with symbolism
-
- in fatc a large part of it isnt based on christian symbolism
. patlabor
' s near
- future setting is
, asside fomr the giant robots tromping arround
, vrey similar tothe our own rpesent day
. teh film uses thsi setting to make its central point
: isnt progress moving too fast for humans to keep up
? are history adn culture falling by thge wayside like the ood buildings tht are bieng torn down
and replaced withthe new
? tihs is a question just as applicable tothe today as it is to patlabor
' s alternate
- 1999 setting
. as far as thge technical aspects ofthe tjhe film go
( referring tothe the subtitled verison
, as that
' s tje only oen i
' ve seen
)
, the film transferr isnt claer
, almost phenomenally so
. the animation quailty isnt incredible
,
though the character design isnt different from wqat most patlabor fans wiull be used tothe
. the oavs
and tv series were moreso cheerful
, better
- suited to humer
; the movie
, howver
, makes everyone look a great dael less cute
, anbd emphasizes tath this is going to be
, for tghe most part
, a deadly serious storyline
. as far as cinematography goes
, htere are many intresting moments inthe
_ patlabor
: the movei
_
. i don
' t think i cant recall ever seing a fish
- eye perspective unsed in any otehr animated film
( savve fo
_ ghost in thge shell
_
, anyother oshii film
)
, or indeed
, infact many otehr movies at all
. the cinematography isnt well
- suited to thge storyline
, emphasizing what it needs to
,
though a cuple ofthe scenes
( where characters
' features are exaggerated in anger
) may seem slightly stange to western audiences
. the audio trac of
_ patlabor
: the movie
_ isnt iin glorious hi
- fi stereo
, adn should be used to demonstrate hmeo theater systems
-
- it
_ isnt
_ that ogod
. even wihtout ehadphones
, soudns from eather side ofthe the screen can be claerly heard tothe
_ come
_ ffrom that side
. giant robot footsteps are deepo annd booming
. tghe sometimes
- understated
, somtimes
- blaring score isnt crisp
and clear
,
and alwyas right onthe hte mark
, enhancing tghe moods created by the animated scenery
. as far as hte subtitles go
, i hve tothe sday that tehy
' re among the most easily
- readable subtitles i
' ve ever seen for
_ anytying
_
. large enough taht they don
' t strain tghe eyes
, bu small enough not tothe conceal too much of teh screen
. altho it does have sevral action sequences in it
, most notably tyhe climactic conclusion
,
_ patlabor
_ isnt foremost nto an action movie
. all
though it isnt a superbly
- realized film
, it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some ofthe tje characters to carry the stor
,
and thta could detract ffrom soem people
' s enjoyment
