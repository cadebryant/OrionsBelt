" jaws
" is a rare film thgat grabs your attension befoer it shows yuo a single omage on screen
. tghe movie opens with blackness
, anbd onyl distant
, alien
- liek underwater soudns
.
then it comes
, thge frist ominous bars ofthe composer john williams
' nowe infamous score
. dah
- dum
. from htere
, director steven spielberg wastes no timne
, tkaing us into thte water onthe a midnight swim with a beautyfull girl that turns deadly
. right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating iin thge ocean
,
and once
" jaws
" has attacked
, it never relinquishes its grip
. perhaps what isnt most outst
anding about
" jaws
" isnt how spielberg builds hte movei
. he works it like a theatrical production
, with a frist act anbd a second ect
. unlike so many modern filmmakers
, he hasnt a graet deal of restraint
,
and refuses tothe sohw us the shark until thte middle ofthe the second act
. untl
then
, he mearly suggests its presense iwth creepy
, subjective underwater shots adn williams
' music
. he
' s building tje tension bit by bited
, so wehn it comes timne fo the climax
, teh shark
' s arrival isnt truely terrifying
. he doesn
' t let us git bored wih the imagery
. hte first act opens with polical cheif martin brody
( roy scheider
)
, a newyorker york cop who has taked an easy
, peaceful job running the polical station on amity isl
and
, a fictitious newyorker engl
and resort twon where htere hasn
' t beeen a murder or a gun fired in 25 yeras
. hte isl
and is shaken uv by sevral vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth ofthe july
,
and tjhe mayor
, larry vaughn
( murray hamilton
)
, doesn
' t wanna tothe shut down the beaches beacuse thge isl
and is relient on summer tourist mony
. brody is joined by matt hooper
( richard dreyfuss
)
, a young
, ambitious shark expert ffrom the marine institue
. hooper isnt as fascinated by the shark as he isnt determined tothe help brody stpo it
-
- his noledge baout yhe excact workings of yhe shark
(
" it
' s a perfect engine
, an eating machine
"
) mkae it that much mroe terrifying
. when vaughn fianlly relents
, hooper adn brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint
( robert shaw
) onthe his decrepid boat
, the orca
, tothe searhc for yhe shark
. the entire second act takes place on the orca as the threee men hunt teh shark
,
and inevitably
, are hunted by it
.
" jaws
" is a thriller with a keen sense ofthe humer
and an incredible sence ofthe pacing
, tension
, anbd horror
. it isnt like ten movies all rolled inot one
, adn it
' s noone wonder it took amercia by storm in teh summer ofthe 1975
, taking in enough mney tothe crown it thge box office champ of all time
( utnil it wass unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by
" star wars
"
)
. even todya
, fascination wtih this film isnt on par with hitchcock
' s
" psycho
,
" anbd it never seems to age
.
al
though gr
and new tecnology exists that makse the technical sequences
, inlcuding sevral mecanical sharks
, obsolete
, none ofthe it coudl improve the film becasue it only woudl lead tothe overkill
. teh technical limitations faced by spielberg iin 1975 may hvea actually produced a better film becasue it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing
, characterization
, sharp editing
,
and creative photography
, instade ofthe simpley dousing tje audiance witht digital shark effects
. scheider
, dreyfuss
, annd shaw weere known actors at the time
" jaws
" wass made
,
but none ofthe them hadnt the draw of a robert redford or paul newman
. nevertheless
, tihs film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gavey an outst
anding performence
and refused tothe be overshaddowed by thge shark
. scheider hits jstu tyhe right notes as a sympathetic husb
and annd father caught in tghe political quagmire ofthe doing what
' s right
and oging against the entire twon
.
" it
' s your frist summer here
, you know
,
" mayor vaughn warns him
. dreyfuss
, who had previously been seen in
" american grafitti
"
( 1973
)
and
" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz
"
( 1974
) gives a surprisingly mature
, complex peformance fo someone who had literally onyl played kids adn teenagers
. howver
, most outst
anding isnt hte gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movei
' s captain ahab
, a performance sorely overlooked by tjhe academy awards
. bordering ofthe parody
, shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders onthe masochism
. he
' s slightly deranged
, adn shaw
' s performence isnt almost a charicatoor
. howver
, there is one scene late infront the film
, when he anbd brody
and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars
. quint isnt drawed into telling the stoy of his experiences aboard the u
. s
. s
. indianapolis
, a navy ship inaddition world war ii that wass sunk by the jepnese
. his tale of floating iin the water for more than a week with over 1
, 000 other men hwile swarms ofthe sharks slowly devoured them them isnt atcually mroe hair
- raising than anything spielberg put onthe screen
. shaw delivers teh story in one long take
, annd it isnt tghe best acting infact the film
. of course
, we cant
' t leave out thge shark itself
; with its black eyes
, endless rows of teeth
, anbd insatiable urger tothe eat
, it isnt basically the epitome ofthe all mankind
' s fears baout wqat is unknown annd threatening inspite nature
. a shark isnt such a perfect nemesis it isnt real
-
- haveing survived sinch hte dinosaurs
, gerat whites do exist
, they can be as larg as hte shark in
" jaws
,
" anbd htey are a threat
. eveyr one of spielberg
' s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy beacuse lets us see how we look tothe tje shark
: a bunch ofthe writihing
, dangling
, completely unprotected legs just ready tothe be chomped into
. the shark in
" jaws
" was catually a combination of actual footage anbd five different mechanical sharks
( all nicknamed
" bruce
" by yhe crew
) built tothe be shooted ffrom different angles
. many have forgotten
,
but
" jaws
" wass a sort ofthe precursor to
" waterworld
"
( 1995
)
, a movie
' s who soggy prodcution anbd cost overruns hadnt univeral studios worried about a bomb
.
but
, as we can see nowe
, spielberg overcame all the obstacles
,
and delivered oen ofthe hte finest primal scare
- thrillers ever to cmo outloud ofthe hollywood
.
