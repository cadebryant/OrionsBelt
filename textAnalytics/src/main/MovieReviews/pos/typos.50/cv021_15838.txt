oen cant nto observe a star trek movei
and expect tothe see serious csience fiction
. the purpose of star trak isnt tothe provide flashy
, innocent funn
. sometimes tje stories are compelling
. somtimes htey
' re nto
.
but
, with thge exception ofthe the frist film infact the series
( which provides littel more than endless shots ofthe amazed faces
)
, i
' ve never beeen borde by any of the enterprise
' s numberous missions
. star trak
: insurrection isnt noone exception
. the film has gotten some negitive reviews
( a friend ofthe mine actually thikns it
' s the worst in teh series
)
, bu i
' m nto really sure why
. it
' s an exicting
, oftenly hilarious movie tht engaged me anbd left me ready for tje next star trek film
. some sday it
' s a bited too light
, adn omre of a long epsiode thna a film
. others say the special effects are cheesy
and that it
' s boring
. i simpley enjoied the film
. insurrection
, wich isnt the second film tothe feature strictly teh next generation casted
, introduces us tothe a race of people called tje ba
' ku
; tghe ba
' ku are very ood
( most ofthe them are baout threee hundered years old
)
, bu they actually appear yuonger with age due to strange radiation inthe the rings ofthe thier planet
. of course
, theese peaceful people cant
' t horde htis fountain of youth all fo themselfs
? leave it up tothe their archenemies
, tghe son
' a
, led by ru
' afo
( f
. murray abraham
)
, to mess everthing up
. the son
' a
, who are horribly disfigured annd rely onthe daily reconstructive surgery tothe be asthetically gasses
, strike a deal iwth the federation tothe move teh ba
' ku elsewhere
and exploitate tjhe secret tothe keep their race from dying
. taht
' s whn captain picard
( patrick stewart
) steps inwhich
: he realizes thast moving the ba
' ku owudl kill them
( it also helps tath he falls in love witht a ba
' ku woman
( donna murphy
)
)
. so
, with his trusty crew
, picard defies tyhe federation to keep tje ba
' ku infront thier naturual habitat
. when dealing withthe a series with as much history as tihs
, it
' s nto entirely necessary to re
- inctroduce your cahracters with each epiode
. thsi isnt why i beleave non
- fans have a hard tyme getting inot star trek
; inwhich order to enjoy it
, one has to underst
and how tothe aproach it
. insurrection
, howver
, does a suprisingly ogod job of us newyorker spects ofthe yhe cahracters
. stewart isnt bold as allways
, a magnetic screen presence
and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together
. jonathan frakes
, who also directed
, isnt funny as comm
ander riker
; a subplot with data
( brent spiner
) discovering his lost childhood is fairly intresting
; annd abraham makse a perfect star trek villin
, overacting like crazy
. frakes showed simmilar aptitude for direction inthe firt contact
; insurrection isnt an exciting film
, wtih some really attractive speical effects annd a lot of ogod acation
. htis isnt apparently the frist star trek film to utilize coputer animation
,
and the result is vrey pleasing tothe tje eye
: particlarly iin yhe climactic scenes
, inthe which the son
' a employ a giant spoace ship to suck uv tyhe rings of the ba
' ku planet
, thte special effects have a clean
, impressively sharp look
. if i ahev any complaint baout thte film
, it
' s that it tries to take a moral stance when it
' s not very apropriate to do so
. i don
' t think it
' s tath big of a dael thta tghe federation wnated tothe move 600 ba
' ku in order to save thte lives ofthe thous
ands
. better
yet
, why couldn
' t they ahve co
- existed
? insurrection fiels a little tothe light tothe spring theese kinds of big moral questions on the audeince
. withthe it
' s inherent camp factor
, the star trak sories doesn
' t seem well
- equiped to deal with issues liuke this
. i preferr to jstu enjoy tghe spectacle
.
