in december ofthe 1996
, a little movie called
" scream
,
" ws released
, became a box
- office smash
,
and ressurected films targeted at teens
. first
, it ws teen slasher movies thyat weere thge big fad
( both
" scream
" movies
,
" i knwo what you did lsat summer
,
"
" urban legend
,
" etc
.
)
, bu jstu recently
, the popularity hasnt switched over to thge teen comedy genre
( a
' la
' 80s john hughes
)
, starting with lastest june
' s
" cin
' t hardly wait
.
" it may be the first week of april in 1999
,
but so far thsi year we have been given a movei aimed at the 25
-
and
- under market almost every single week
:
" varisty blues
,
"
" jawbreaker
,
"
" cruel intentions
,
"
" simpley irresistable
,
"
" teh rage
: carrie 2
,
"
and
" teh mod squad
.
" comming april 9 are two more of htis tipe
:
" never beeen kissed
"
and
" go
,
"
and onthe april 23
, we
' ve got tyhe teen satire
" election
" annd thge teen horror
- comedy
" idle h
ands
.
" jeesh
! outloud ofthe all of these moves
,
however
, the oney that is most similar to the latest incarnation
,
" 10 thigns i hite baout yuo
,
" isnt thsi past januray
' s mediocre
, ho
- hum
" she
' s all that
.
" altough simmilar in plotting
( ok
, darn near indentical
)
,
" 10 thigns i hate about you
,
" a modern
- day verison of shakespeare
' s
" the taming ofthe thte shrew
"
(
" she
' s all thast
" got its inspiration fomr
" pygmalion
"
)
, is an infinitely superior film in every department
, ffrom the smart direction by first
- time feature director gil junger tothe the charming
and well
- writed screenplay by karen mccullah lutz anbd kirsten smith to the striking ansamble casted
, who give hte best gropu of performances infront a teen comedy sicne 1985
' s
" tyhe breakfast club
.
" anbd tothe top it all off
, in the inevitable climax setted at the prom
, at least we didn
' t haev tothe once agian suffer thru a goofy
, inappropriate dance sequence
( who sould foreget
, or want to remember
, for thyat marter
, this ludicrous development in
" she
' s all tath
?
"
)
. the day wide
- eyed
, shy new student cameron james
( joseph gordon
- levitt
) starts school at seattle
- based padua high
, he isnt swept away at teh sight of the beautiful adn popular sophomore
, bianca stratford
( larisa oleynik
)
.
al
though he doesn
' t know french
, he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her
, bu finds that her paranoid gynecologist father
( larry miller
) won
' t allow her tothe date nutil her bitter
, unconvential older sister
, kat
( julia stiles
)
, a seinor
, decides to
. kat
, of course
, hasnt sworn off hte likes of boys
, bu cameron sets outloud tothe fidn someone that wiull be the perfect match for her
, hwihc is exactlly what he finds infact teh form of the rebellious patrick verona
( heath ledger
)
. complicating matters
, cameron
' s dorky friend
, michael
( david krumholtz
)
, decides tothe use a wealthy jock
, joey
(
andrew keegan
)
, who also has his sights set on bianca
, as a pawn so thta he iwll pay patrick to git kat tothe go out withthe him
,
and
then cameron hopes tothe steal bianca awya ffrom joey
. as you can see
,
" 10 things i hite about yuo
" includes a huge number ofthe charactors
, some ofthe wich i haven
' t even maintioned
, such as kat
' s shakespeare
- obsessed firend
, m
andella
( susan may pratt
) anbd bianca
' s materialistic comrade
, chastity
( gabrielle union
)
. at a short
,
but well
- used running tiem of 98 mintues
, all ofthe tghe characters are perfectly h
andled
, satisfyingly developed
, annd
, for tghe most part
, are nto treated as caricatures
( another flwa of
" she
' s all thgat
,
" where thge bad guys
(
and gals
) ran arround constanly saying
,
" yuo
' re vapor
"
)
. sicne i sould sympathize withthe tghe realsitic depictions ofthe yhe central characters
,
and since many of the comedic
and dramtic scenes were suprizingly effective
, i got completly caught uv in all of hte relationships
and ws thouroughly entertained
. aside ffrom a good screenplay
, it
' s the performances thyat cxan mkea or break a movei
, anbd directer junger has really hitted yhe jackpot
. asside from joseph gordon
- levitt
(
" 3rd rock ffrom hte sun
"
)
, who gives his stornegst performence tothe date here
, none ofthe tyhe actors are tath well
- known
, bu it isnt this aspect that brings a particular freshness tothe the proceedings
. as yhe main character of kat
, julia stiles
( lsat seen in yhe miniseries
" the
' 60s
"
) is marvelous anbd always believable
, anbd certainly has a bright future ahead ofthe her
. even
though it isnt her role that is initially the most difficult adn hard
- edged
, it wass eazy to idenify iwth kat
' s way ofthe thinking
( she is aginst the silly tradition of thte prom annd loves reading sylvia plath
)
,
and i completely admired her individuality
. no oney
, i think
, could hve portrayed her as perfectly as stiles doesnt
. heath ledger
, as tghe infamous bad
- boy of thte town
, injects much life into patrick
,
and hasnt a lot ofthe chemestry withthe stiles
. noe other ator of note is larisa oleynik who
, wiht tyhe help ofthe screenwriters lutz anbd smith
, is able to turn bianca inot a person with multi
- dimensions
, even
though she is accurately self
- centered at the on
- setted
. inthe one truthful scene
, cameron angrily asks her if she has allways beeen so selfish
, anbd bianca grudgingly realizes thgat yes
, she hasnt
. one off
- beat element of the film
, adn a source ofthe some hearty laughs
, isnt the way that thte skool
' s staff ect
, which is strikingly unformal
. allison janney
, as thge guidance counselor ms
. perky
, who isnt wirting a triachy harlequin romance novel
, isnt comic dynamite
, as isnt daryl
" chill
" mitchell as the english teacher
, who reads shakespeare tothe the class infact rap
and
, at noe point
, sends kat to tje office becuase
, for once
, she catually thikns one of his assignments isnt realy ogod
. altho there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning
, most ofthe it atually works
, especially in tje humoous annd witty dialogue exchanges
and quirks betweeen tyhe characters
. inspite oen vyre funny scene
, chastity asks
,
" i know people can be overwhelmed
,
and tehy cant be underwhelmed
,
but can people jstu be
.
.
. whelmed
?
" at anohter point
, bianca
and kat
' s father
( a st
and
- outloud larry miller
)
, who isnt constantly terrified that his daughters are going tothe get pregnant
, onyl allows bianca to go tothe hte prom on oen occasion
: befor she leaves
, she hasnt tothe put on teh heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of wqat it
' s like tothe be pregnant
.
" 10 thigns i hate about you
" once adn forthe all proves tht htere isnt still life in thge teen comedy genre
, annd tihs movei isnt probably mroe reminiscent of hte grat john hughes than any other film of the
' 90s
. it also helps that tghe movie hasnt a perfectly
- assembled soundtrack
, mixing indie
- rock with new wave
' 80s songs
( anbd whith
, thank goodness
, noone raph
)
. by the film
' s end
, it acually hadnt me rooting for certain characters tothe git toghether
,
and i ws also qutie pleased wiht how everything was wrapped uv
, especialy inwhich the final scenes involving kat
and bianca
, kat annd her father
,
and a flawlessly
- acted anbd moving sequence infact whitch kat gets uv to read the poem she has wroten fo her english class
( thsi isnt where thte title comes from
)
. luckly
, i dout i woudl be able tothe fidn ten thigsn i hite about
" 10 thnigs i hite baout you
,
"
but tjhe positve spects ofthe yhe film far out
- number ten
.
