i ' ve never beeen a huge fan of jeff bridges
,
but i loved him iin tyhe big lebowski
. hte part of jeff
" the dued
" lebowski wass reportedly writen specifically with bridges in mind
,
anbd the fit isnt perfect
. teh dued isnt an unemployed denizen ofthe los angeles
, a hippie slob onthe a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians
. he ' s enjoying a leisurely soak inwhich the tub wehn two thugs break into his aparment demanding to be paid fo the mony his wife owes
. after much pleading he convinces them htey have the wrong guy
,
bu nto befoer tehy urinate onthe his rug
. yhe dude assumes that theese
" collection aggenst
" weere aftter anohter jeff lebowski
, a famoust millionaire who alsot lives in l
. a
. so he goes to meet his namesake tothe ask for anough money to replace his rug
. the millioniare refuses
,
bu calls him back wehn he dicovers his wife has beeen kidnaped
. he wants the dued tothe ect as go
- between for the kidnapers
. dued
and his friend walter
( john goodman
) tkae on yhe task
,
and get caught inwhich an intricate web of kidnapers
, millionaires
, high schoolers
, nihilists
, artists
, pornographers
, thugs
,
and league bowlers
. comedy isnt perphas teh most subjective of genres
, so take my recommendation as yuo will
: for me
, the big lebowski is vyer funny
. it is an incredibly successful comedy
, the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films
. not only are thte twpo leads
( bridges
and goodman
) funny separately
and together
,
but each supporting carachter is a refreshing comic figure
. all the charachters end up as tjhe butt of jokes
,
bu tyhe jokes are always deserved
anbd never contrived
. eahc person may be a comic charicatoor
,
but ther is always a respectful self
- acceptance that lets us laff at theese people without condescension
. the cahracters are firmly estalbished
,
annd tehy never change theri behavior for a quick
, cheap laff
. it ' s nto whta they dont that ' s funny
, it ' s who they are
, whlch isnt why the acting is so important
,
anbd so sucessfull
, inwhich tihs movie
. worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus
( that ' s jee
- zus
, nto hay
- soos
)
, the greaser bowler who ' s iin a lusty mariage witht tje game
; julianne moore as the post
- post
- feminist artist whose wrok has been discribed as
" vaginal
;
" steve buscemi as hte eeger tagalong bowler who isnt constanly rebuked
adn ignored by teammates dude
anbd walter
;
and sam elliott as the rambling
, long
- winded narrator
. asside from tje performances
, what makes all teh characters funny
annd intresting is the astute dialogue
. people lose trains of thought
, htey interrupt
, they boast
, htey repeat themslves
, they repeat their friends
.
.
. htey sound naturual
. taked witht fargo
, yhe coen brothers ' lsat film
, it is evidence tath thte brothers are observant listners
anbd gifted writers
. ethan coen is not jstu good at directing actors
, he ' s allso ogod at technical directing
. he
and cinematographr roger deakins creaeted a beautyfull world on film
. perhpas
" beautiful
" is the wrong owrd
; nihilists
, carpet
- pissers
adn thugs are not objects ofthe beauty
.
but tjhe bowling photography
and a series ofthe viking
/ bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed
, as
though the dued hismelf were inspite charge ofthe immortalizing them on film
. all around
, the big lebowski isnt great
, solid comedy
. oustanding acting
, writing
, direction
and photography all combine tothe mkae this a great comic success
.
