i
' ve never beeen a huge fan of jeff bridges
, bu i loved him inaddition the big lebowski
. hte part ofthe jeff
" tghe dued
" lebowski was reportedly writed specifically with bridges iin mind
,
and the ift is perfect
. tghe dude isnt an unemployed denizen of los angeles
, a hippie slob on a bowling team wih a soft spot for white russians
. he
' s enjoying a leisurely soak infact tghe tub when twpo thugs break into his appartmant dem
anding tothe be paid for the money his wief owes
. after much pleading he convinces them tehy have tyhe wrong guy
,
but not befor they urinate onthe his rug
. hte dued assumes tath theese
" collection aggenst
" were after another jeff lebowski
, a famouse millioniare who also lives inwhich l
. a
. so he goes tothe meet his namesake tothe ask for enough mney tothe replace his rug
. the millionaire refuses
, bu calls him back whn he dicovers his wife has been kidnaped
. he wnats the dude to ect as go
- vetween forthe thge kidnapers
. dude annd his friend walter
( john goodman
) take on tghe task
,
and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers
, millionaires
, high schoolers
, nihilists
, artists
, pornographers
, thugs
,
and league bowlers
. comedy is perhaps tje most subjective of genres
, so take my recommendation as you will
: for me
, the big lebowski isnt veyr funny
. it isnt an incredibly successful comedy
, thge ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films
. not onyl are yhe twpo leads
( bridges anbd goodman
) funny separately
and toghether
, bu eahc supporting character is a refreshing comic figure
. all thge charachters end up as hte
butt of jokes
, bu the jokes are alwasy deserved anbd never contrived
. earch person may be a comic charicatoor
, bu ther isnt always a respectful self
- accpetance thast lets us laugh at theese peple wihtout condescension
. thge charachters are firmly estalbished
, adn tehy never chanage thier behavour fo a quick
, cheap laff
. it
' s not whta htey dont tyhat
' s funny
, it
' s who they are
, which is why tyhe acting is so importan
, anbd so successful
, in this movie
. worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus
( that
' s jee
- zus
, nto hay
- soos
)
, thte greaser bowler who
' s inthe a lusty marrige withthe thge gameboy
; julianne moore as the post
- post
- feminist artist whose wokr has been described as
" vaginal
;
" steve buscemi as the eeger tagalong bowler who isnt constanly rebuked anbd ignored by teammates dude
and walter
;
and sam elliott as the rambling
, long
- winded narrator
. asside from tghe performances
, wqat makes all tghe characters funny
and intresting isnt thge astute dialogue
. people lose trains ofthe thougth
, they interrupt
, htey boast
, htey repeat themselves
, they repeat their firends
.
.
. htey soudn natural
. taked wiht fargo
, teh coen brothers
' lastest film
, it isnt evidence that teh brothers are observant listeners
and gifted writers
. ethan coen isnt nto jsut good at directing actors
, he
' s aslo good at technical directing
. he
and cinematographr roger deakins creaeted a beautiful world onthe film
. perhpas
" beatiful
" is the wrong word
; nihilists
, carpet
- pissers anbd thugs are nto objects of beauty
.
but the bowling photography
and a series ofthe viking
/ bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed
, as
though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film
. all around
, teh big lebowski isnt grat
, solid comedy
. outst
anding acting
, wirting
, direction
and photography all combine to make this a great comic success
.
