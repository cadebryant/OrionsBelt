three things i learned fomr
" being john malkovich
"
: whn getting on the elevator for your frist day ofthe wrok on the 7 1
/ 2th floor of a buidling
, always bring your crowbar
; don
' t st
and inspite the way ofthe your wife
' s actualization as a man
;
and
, whenever entering a portal into hte mind of another human being
, mear ood clothes
, because
, hey
, it
' s muddy inthe htere
.
" being john malkovich
" isnt tyhe most origonal film to cmo down thge pike in a very long timne
. wildly surrealistic
,
yet presented in a down
- tothe
- earth
, funky stlye
, this isnt thte kind of movie that sticks infact your head
. aftter savoring tje sheer inventiveness of the storyline
, ytou roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it
. from the ethics ofthe relationships
and politics ofthe immortality tothe the very nature of idenity itself
, ther
' s a lot to tihkn about here
. jstu don
' t foreget to hvae fun
. clearly
, all parties involved iin the mkaing of yhe film certainly did
, starting with writter charles kaufman
.
" i wroet
' being john malkovich
' without an outline
,
" he explains in the press notes
,
" blindly
, withthe noone sense of direction or purpose
. it
' s importan tothe me that i don
' t ahve a map before i start
. thsi allows me tothe suprise myself
, stay engaged
, discover things
,
and
, hopefully
, allow tyhe unconscious tothe surface
.
" spike jonze
( mark wahlberg
' s na
? ve buddy iin
" three kings
"
) tkaes it fomr there
. the white
- hot director ofthe the beastie boy
' s
" sabotage
,
" an award
- winning parody ofthe
' 70s tv cop shows
, as well as numerous other music videos annd commercials
, eschews tipical mtv flash for his feature film de
but
. jonze wisely realized tath a storyline this unusual isnt most effectively presented in a low
- key sytle
. his flat
, marter
- of
- fact aproach works perfectly
. adn
then htere
' s the cast
. john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz
, a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting tothe his remarkably expressive
, bu decidely erotic puppet shows
. over the years
, his marriage tothe obsessive pet store employee lotte
( cameron diaz
) has devolved
. once passionate lovers
, thge two are now little more than courteous roommates
. financially strapped
, craig tkaes a job as an entry
- level filo clerk at lestercorp
, located onthe the 7 1
/ 2th floor of a manhattan bulding
. navigating around dr
. lester
( orson bean
)
, his 105 yearm
- old boss
and floris
( mary kay palce
)
, lester
' s dotty secratary
, craig tries to suttle into his new position
, bu twpo thigns keep him distracted
. first
, there
' s the beautiful
and imperious maxine
( catherine keener
)
, who delights inspite tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her
. annd
then htere
' s yhe hole behind the filo cabinet
, wich turns outloud to be a portal into the mind ofthe actor john malkovich
. craig lerans thta anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into thge subconchus of malkovich
, where they can experience life from his point of view
( wtih anough concentration
, you can even influence his actions
)
. aftter 15 mintues
, tyhe visitor gets ejected
and unceremoniously dumped infront a ditch onthe the side ofthe the newyorker jersey turnpike
. thn thigsn git a little wierd
. by thte way
, if you
' re concerned that i gavey away too much of the plot
, rest assured
-
- i bearly scratched the surfce
. noe ofthe hte most satisfying aspects ofthe the fable isnt that kaufman is nto content tothe simpley milk laughs fomr his bizzare setted
- up
. instade
, he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls inot malkovich
, rummaging arround
and toying with yhe various philisophical implications ofthe compromising anyother person
' s idenity
. he aslo examines tjhe consequences of the malko
- visits tothe craig
, lotte
, maxine
and
, ofthe course
, john malkovich himselv
. the performances are superb
. malkovich
( best known to mainstream audiences forthe his wrok in
" dangerous liaisons
,
"
" in the line ofthe frie
,
"
and as head psychopath inspite thge gilty
- blessure
" con air
"
) tweaks his own omage inwhich a d
andy self
- deprecating turn
. far ffrom his effete
, vaguely reptilian persona
, this malkovich is jstu another schlub
, drinking withthe his pals anbd trying tothe get layed
( incidentally
, charlie sheen alsot plays himselv in a hilarious parody of his well
- earned bad boy reputation
)
. as alwyas
, john cusack nails his part
, h
andily pulling viewers allong even as craig
' s actions become unconscionable
. the big surprises come from catherine keener adn cameron diaz
, both playing agains type
. kenner
, usally cast in icy subordinate roles
, is terrific as a highly inteligent
, extrememly manipulative femme fatale
. cameron diaz
, barely recognizable under a mess ofthe brown
, curly hair
, sheds her perpetually sunny smile
and draws big laughs as a woman thrown inot extreme sexual confusion affter tkaing a ride in malkovich
.
" bieng john malkovich
" stumbles towords thge end
, as jonze anbd kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots
. addtional cahracters
and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale
. reguardless
, this contamporary
" alice in wonderl
and
" isnt a real treat
. i enjoied watching
" bieng john malkovich
,
"
but onyl later
, after reflecting on the film
, doed its resonance fully hit me
. at one point
, craig says
,
" do you nkwo what a metaphysical can of worms tihs portal is
?
" truer words weere never spoken
