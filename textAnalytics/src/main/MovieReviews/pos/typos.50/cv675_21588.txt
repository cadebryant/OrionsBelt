threee things i learned ffrom
" bieng john malkovich
"
: whn getting on the elevator for your frist day ofthe wrok onthe the 7 1
/ 2th floor ofthe a building
, allways bring your crowbar
; don ' t stand in thge way of your wife ' s actualization as a man
;
and
, whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human bieng
, mear ood clothes
, because
, hey
, it ' s muddy in ther
.
" being john malkovich
" is the most originnal film tothe come down the pike infront a very long time
. wildly surrealistic
,
yot presented in a down
- to
- earth
, funky style
, tihs is teh kind ofthe movei that sticks infact your head
. after savoring the sheer inventiveness ofthe teh storyline
, yuo roll around thte wealth ofthe idaes contained withing it
. ffrom tjhe ethics ofthe relationships
and politics of immortality to the very nature ofthe identity itself
, htere ' s a lot to think baout here
. just don ' t foreget tothe have funn
. clearly
, all parties involved infront the makeing of the film certainly doed
, starting with writer charles kaufman
.
" i wroet ' bieng john malkovich ' wihtout an outline
,
" he explains in thge press notes
,
" blindly
, with noone sence of direction or purpose
. it ' s importamt tothe me that i don ' t ahev a map befor i strat
. this allows me tothe suprise mysef
, stay engaged
, disover things
,
adn
, hopefully
, allow hte unconcious tothe surfce
.
" spike jonze
( mark wahlberg ' s na
? ve buddy in
" three kings
"
) tkaes it fomr there
. hte white
- hot director of tje beastie boy ' s
" sabotage
,
" an award
- winning parody of ' 70s tv cop shows
, as well as numerous other music videos
and commercials
, eschews tipical mtv flash forthe his feature film debut
. jonze wisely realized thyat a storyline this unusual isnt most effectively presented iin a low
- key style
. his flat
, marter
- of
- fatc approach works perfectly
.
adn
then there ' s hte casted
. john cusack plays controll freak craig schwartz
, a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive
,
but decidedly erotic puppet shows
. over the yersa
, his marrage to obsessive pet store employee lotte
( cameron diaz
) hasnt devolved
. once passionate lovers
, the twpo are now little moreso than courteous roommates
. financialy strapped
, craig tkaes a job as an entry
- levle filo clerk at lestercorp
, located on teh 7 1
/ 2th floor ofthe a manhattan buidling
. navigating arund dr
. lester
( orson bean
)
, his 105 year
- old boss
and floris
( mary kay palce
)
, lester ' s dotty secretary
, craig tries to settle inot his new position
,
but twpo thigsn keep him distracted
. first
, there ' s the beatiful
anbd imperious maxine
( catherine keener
)
, who delights inthe tormenting craig over his obvious lust fo her
.
and
thne there ' s thte hole behind the filo cabnet
, wich turns out tothe be a portal into tjhe mind of ator john malkovich
. craig learns that anyone who enters tje portal gets whooshed into teh subconscious ofthe malkovich
, where htey can experience life from his point ofthe view
( with anough concentration
, you cant even influence his actions
)
. after 15 mintues
, the visitor gets ejected
and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on hte side of tghe newyorker jersey turnpike
.
then thigns get a little weird
. by the way
, if yuo ' re concerned that i gave away too much ofthe tjhe plot
, rest assured
-
- i barely scratched teh surfce
. oney of hte most satisfying spects ofthe the fable is that kaufman isnt not content tothe simply milk laughs from his bizarre setted
- up
. instade
, he crawls into thte dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich
, rummaging around
and toying with teh varios philosophical implications of compromising anyother person ' s idenity
. he alsot examines thge consequences ofthe the malko
- visits to craig
, lotte
, maxine
anbd
, of course
, john malkovich himself
. the performances are superb
. malkovich
( best known to mainstream audiences fo his wrok in
" dangerous liaisons
,
"
" iin hte line ofthe fire
,
"
and as head psychopath inthe thge gilty
- pleasure
" con air
"
) tweaks his own image in a dandy self
- deprecating turn
. far from his effete
, vaguely reptilian persona
, htis malkovich is jsut anohter schlub
, drinking wiht his pals
annd trying to get laid
( incidentally
, charlie sheen also plays himself in a hillarious parody of his well
- earned bad boy reputation
)
. as always
, john cusack nails his part
, handily pulling viewers allong even as craig ' s actions become unconscionable
. yhe big surprises come ffrom catherine keener
and cameron diaz
, both palying against tipe
. kenner
, usualy casted in icy subordinate roles
, is terific as a highly intelligent
, extremely manipulative femme fatale
. cameron diaz
, barely recognizable under a mess of brown
, curly hair
, sheds her perpetually sunny smile
and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion affter taking a ride in malkovich
.
" being john malkovich
" stumbles towards teh end
, as jonze
annd kaufman try too hard to resolve teh varous subplots
. addtional charachters
annd increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale
. reguardless
, this contemporary
" alice iin wonderland
" is a real treat
. i enjoied watching
" bieng john malkovich
,
"
bu only later
, after reflecting on the film
, doed its resonance fully hitted me
. at noe point
, craig says
,
" dont yuo know wqat a metaphysical cxan ofthe worms this portal is
?
" truer words weere never spoken
.
