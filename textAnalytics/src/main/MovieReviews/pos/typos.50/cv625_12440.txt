one of the best movies i
' ve ever seen
. i
' d heared extremely good thigsn baout this movie
,
and
though the previews didn
' t raelly intrigue that much
, it was a movie i
' d beeen anticipating forthe a few months nowe
. fo smoe reason i
' m nto sure of
- this movie was not that big a sucess over infront hte u
. s
. it was a dfeinite hit with hte critics
,
but didn
' t exactly setted any box office records
. after viewing htis incredibly well directed
, writed annd acted movei
, i cin
' t help
but wonder
- why
? teh strength ofthe htis film isnt it
' s gritty realism
. thte main cahracters are all human iwth individule flaws
, noone stereo
- type hollywood hreoes
. ytou may not agre wih many of theri actions inaddition the movie or their approach to life
, bu that isnt whta makse it so rela
. i hadnt expected this movie tothe be more ofthe a drama than a thriller
,
but i ws mistaken
. even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so taht it feeled jstu as thrilling as any car chase
. annd yhe ending
.
.
.
.
.
. whoa
. i
' ve never seen a movei inthe my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly
. tyhe three male leads
- guy pearce
, kevin spacey
and russell crowe are all just terific
. thte
' best atcor
' oscar talk sorrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue
, bu there is oney probelm there
. how coudl htey haev chosen between these three actors
? there is noone way i sould look at htis film
and sday oen ofthe them wass better thna tghe otehr two
. it
' s impossible
. kim bassinger
' s peformance isnt aslo a revelation
. i
' d never been a big fan ofthe hers before
and allways thougth she wass
, well
.
.
. what
' s the word
- a twinky
? that impression has changed
, as she complemented crowe
and pearce perfectly
. thge depth to the story adn characters is truley astounding
. no cardboard characters here
. the plot isnt full ofthe twists
and turns
and soem veyr clever sequences
. pearce
' s interogation ofthe three seperate suspects is nothing short ofthe briliant
. i really cin
' t fault htis movei at all
. i ws so glad tothe see fellow austrailian
' s pearce anbd crowe star inaddition such a breathtaking movei
. i had been vyer familiar withthe russell crowe beforeh
and fomr his many australian films
, bu had not seen much of guy pearce
. i intend to chanage thsi next tiome i visit thge video tsore
