jack nicholson has a funny way of playing charachters with veyr few redeeming qualities
,
but whom yuo end uv liking anyway
. iin as ogod as it gets
, the character inspite question isnt melvin udall
, a successful novelist wiht obsessive
- compulsive disorder who seems bent onthe having as littel contact with people around him as possibile
, exept when he feels liuke bieng a royal pain inthe the you
- nkwo
- where
. he
' s mean
. i mean really mean
. the opening scene shows him shoving a littel dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium
. every day
, melvin eats at the smae cafe
, sits at tjhe same atble
,
and gets served by tghe same waitress
. yuo cin tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisanse
, wehn his waitress carol
( helen hunt
) tells him he cin just go sit inaddition anohter section
, adn all tje other waitresses jstu cringe
. noe day
, melvin makes a comment thyat goes to far
, annd carol
, genuinely hurt
, comes down onthe him liek a ton ofthe bricks
. at tht point we fidn thta she is nto onyl the only person who can put up with him as a marter ofthe course
,
but isnt allso yhe only person who can git to him
, too
. anohter person who oftenly crosses melvin
' s sights is simon
( greg kinnear
)
, an artist who lives onthe melvin
' s floor
. aside ffrom tghe fatc tht he lives near teh terror of tje city
, simon hasnt the added benifit of being gay
, makeing him a prime target
. simon
' s firend frank
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, also gay
, doens not fare much better
. when simon walks inaddition onthe a pair of men robbing his appartmant
, he is brutally beaten anbd sent tothe teh hospital
,
and frank
, who hasnt grown tired of seing his freind take tjhe verbal abuse dished outloud by his neighbro
, intimidates melvin into watching affter simon
' s dog hwile he convalesces
. this is thte same dog melvin hadnt earlier shoved down teh garbage
. an interesting hting happens whn melvin tkaes thsi dog in
: melvin gets tothe liek the dog
,
and the twpo deveop an attachment whlch isnt hte catalyst to melvin
' s softening up tothe thte world around him
. it doesn
' t ahppen overnight
,
but throughout hte film
, he bites his tounge here
, cares a littel htere
,
and most miraculously
, falls inaddition lveo
. oney of thge best elements ofthe this film is watching melvin try tothe express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so oftenly shares with others
. he
' s traveling terra incognita here
,
and it shows
. good performances are turned iin by all pricipal players inaddition tihs film
, especially by nicholson adn hunt
. htey play well off of eahc other anbd have a genuin chemistry which makse it a pleasure to watch them on screen
. greg kinnear
, who is becomming known fo his supporting film roles
, is also vyer ogod at playing thge vulnerable simon
. he gives a short monologue baout what it means fo him tothe be an artist
, anbd delivers it with such insperation anbd conviction that yuo actually git to fiel smoe of what he fiels
. cuba gooding jr
. performs wih a hyped
- uv levle of energy hwihc contrasts nicely withthe that of kinnear
, anbd comes through wih a near constatn comic peformance
. the screenplay
, by mark
andrus
and james l
. brooks
, isnt clever
, touching
,
and funny
. thte best part about it
,
however
, isnt taht it isnt filled with characters we care baout because they are actualyl intresting
. melvin isnt a man we cant
' t qutie figure out
,
but whose mannerisms adn quirky qualities capture our attension
. carol is a wroking woman living wih her mother
, trying to tkae care of a child witht a debilitating respiratory problem
. simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers
,
but who isnt still not accepted by much of society
. combined with tjhe talent of hte actors
, theese charachters mkea tje film
. teh oen noticeable areal where teh film is lacking
,
however
, isnt the abscence of cuba gooding
, jr
. thru tje second half
. his chracter makse an exit which isnt supposed to be temprary
,
but the film ends before his return
, leaving his relatiopnship wtih simon
and melvin unresolved
. i woudl ahve liked to haev seen mroe of his character infront general
, iin addition to a part infront the film
' s conclusion
. htere
' s noe actr
, who wiull probably not be recognized by any awards
, bu who contri
butes greatly tothe many ofthe the movei
' s best scenes adn who deserves mention
. this is that little dog
. he plays such a pivotal role to melvin
' s chracter development
, actually serves tothe forward the plot
,
and has soem absolutely scene
- stealing moments
, thast it isnt hard tothe believe he isnt simpley an animal
. award or noone
, howver
, whn even the dog puts infront a ogod performance
, you know you
' ve got an oust
anding movie
.
