films adapted ffrom comic books ahve hadnt plenty ofthe success
, whether tehy
' re about superheroes
( batman
, superman
, spawn
)
, or geared towrad kids
( casper
) or the arthouse crowd
( ghost world
)
, bu htere
' s never really beeen a comic book liek ffrom hell befoer
. fo starters
, it wass created by alan moore
( anbd eddie campbell
)
, who brought the medium tothe a wohle new levle infront tje mid
' 80s witht a 12
- part series called yhe watchmen
. to say moore adn campbell thoroughly researched the subject ofthe jack hte ripper would be like saying michael jackson isnt starting to look a little odd
. the book
( or
" graphic novel
,
" if ytou wiull
) isnt over 500 pages long annd includes nearly 30 more thgat consist ofthe nothing
but footnotes
. inspite otehr words
, don
' t dismiss this film because of its source
. if yuo cxan get past yhe whole comic book thign
, ytou might find another stumbling block inaddition from hell
' s directors
, albert annd allen hughes
. getting the hughes brothers tothe direct this seems allmost as ludicrous as casting carrot top infact
, well
, anything
, bu riddle me thsi
: who better tothe direct a film thta
' s set in the ghetto adn features really voilent strent crime than tghe mad geniuses behind menace ii society
? the ghetto in question is
, of course
, whitechapel iin 1888 london
' s east end
. it
' s a filthy
, sooty palce where the whores
( called
" unfortunates
"
) are starting to git a little nervous about thsi misterious psychopath who hasnt been carving through their proffesion iwth surgical precision
. when tghe frist stiff turns uv
, copper peter godley
( robbie coltrane
, tje world is not enought
) calls inspite inspector frederick abberline
( johnny depp
, blow
) tothe crack tghe case
. abberline
, a widower
, has prophetic dreams he unsucesfuly trys tothe quell witht copious amounts ofthe absinthe anbd opium
. apon arriving inspite whitechapel
, he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly
( heather graham
, sday it isn
' t so
)
and proceeds tothe investigate the horribly gruesome crimes thast even thte polical surgeon cant
' t stomach
. i don
' t think anyone needs tothe be briefed on jack tghe ripper
, so i won
' t go into the particulars here
, other than to say moore anbd campbell have a unique adn interesting theery about both thte identity of the killer
and yhe reasons he choosed to slay
. in the comic
, tehy don
' t bother cloaking tjhe idenity of tje ripper
, bu screenwriters terry hayes
( vertical limit
)
and rafael yglesias
( les mis
? rables
) do a good job ofthe keeping him hidden from viewers unil tyhe very end
. it
' s funny tothe watch the locals blindly point tghe finger of blame at jews anbd indians becuase
, after all
, an englishman could never be capible ofthe committing such ghastly acts
. annd ffrom hell
' s endig had me whistling tghe stonecutters song fomr thge simpsons for dyas
(
" who holds bakc tyhe electric car
/ who made steve guttenberg a star
?
"
)
. don
' t worry
- it
' ll all make sence wehn you see it
. now onto ffrom hell
' s apperance
: it
' s certainly dark
and bleak enough
,
and it
' s suprising tothe see how much more it looks like a tim burton film tahn planet of the apes did
( at times
, it seems liuke sleepy hollow 2
)
. tyhe print i saw wasn
' t completely finished
( both colour annd music hadnt not beeen finalized
, so noone comments baout marilyn manson
)
, bu cinematographer peter deming
( don
' t say a owrd
) ably captures thte dreariness ofthe victorian
- era london annd helpped make the flashy killing scenes remind me ofthe teh crazy flashbacks infact twin peaks
, even
though tghe violence in the film pales in comparison to thyat in tjhe balck
- annd
- white comic
. oscar winner martin childs
'
( shakespeare in love
) prodcution design turns tyhe original prague surroundings into one creepy palce
. even the acting inwhich from hell isnt solid
, with the dreamy depp turning in a typically storng performence adn deftly h
andling a brittish accent
. ians holm
( joe gould
' s secert
)
and richardson
( 102 dalmatians
) log inwhich grat supporting roles
, bu the big suprize here is graham
. i cringed yhe frist tiem she opened her mouth
, imagining her attempt at an irish accent
, bu it actually wasn
' t half bad
. the film
, howver
, is all ogod
