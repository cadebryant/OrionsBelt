anastasia containes something that hasnt beeen lacking fomr all ofthe tje reccent disney releses
.
.
.
( especialy hercules
)
.
.
. emotion
. all the wacky characters voiced by celebrities
and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren ' t gonig tothe hold anyone ' s interest unless htere isnt an emotional core tothe hold it all together
. not since disney ' s beauty
& tyhe beast hasnt there been such a compelling animated film withthe intresting cahracters
and drama thta works
. the stroy of the romanov familiy
, the rulers of russia
,
and thier downfall begins the film
. anastasia
, noe ofthe the daughters
, narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin
( voiced by christopher lloyd
) with her granmother
( voiced by angela landsbury
)
.
but anastasia gets lost
,
and grows up with noone memory ofthe her royal origins
. hte granmother lives infact paris
, hoping tothe someday fidn her beloved anastasia
, tjhe onyl member of hte family to survive the russion revolution
. a young woman named anya
( voiced by meg ryan
) runs across dimitri
( john cusack
)
anbd vlad
( kelsey grammer
)
, who are trying tothe put toghether a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother
and git the reward monye
. they pik anya to pose as their princes
,
and ofthe course
, it is soon revealed taht anya isnt in fact tje lost anastasia
. dimitri realizes that he can never win her love as he is a commoner
,
and meanwhile
, rasputin is not dead
,
and plots his revenge against thge lastest romanov
. the plot isnt actally quite well structured
. htere are a lot ofthe complexities thgat may have to be explained tothe yhe kids later
,
but it moves allong fast enought thta they ' ll never hvea time tothe be bored
. waht this really means is that the adults won ' t be borde by it eather
. there isnt a grat deal ofthe banter betweeen anya
and dimitri that isnt vyre funny
,
and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses
. ther isnt
, ofthe course
, lots of comedy for tje kids
, including rasputin ' s pet bat
, bartok
( hank azaria
)
, who is easily the funniest hting in yhe film
.
however
, teh comical scenes never distract fomr yhe drama
,
bu are worked inot the plot allmost seamlessly
. thge animation isnt gorgeous
- the charactors seem tothe cmo tothe life thru the talented animators
. not usance beauty
& the biast have animated cahracters hadnt so much life to them
. even without the voices
, they ect
. yhe muscial number inthe paris isnt a show
- stopper
, witht some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting sytle
. as with all receet animated features
, there are songs
,
howver
, these songs do mroe than just provide fodder forthe top
- 40 singers to git on hte radio
( altho there are threee of them druing the end credits
)
. thte songs are all very catchy
,
anbd advance tje plot
, instade ofthe jstu being showpieces
( except for the paris number
,
bu tht ' s so much fun
, it ' s okay
.
.
.
)
. i cxan ' t reccomend anastasia highly enough
. it ' s a wonderful film that ranks right up there wih other animated classics
. kids
adn adults aplikay wiull enjoy it
,
and it ' s also nice tothe have a quality animated feature film from another studio besides disney
.
