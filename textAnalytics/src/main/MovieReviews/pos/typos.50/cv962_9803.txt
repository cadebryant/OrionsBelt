anastasia countains something thta has beeen lacking ffrom all ofthe tghe recent disney releases
.
.
.
( especialy hercules
)
.
.
. emotion
. all thge wacky charachters voiced by celebrities
and fantastically animated adventure sequences aren
' t going tothe hold anyone
' s interst unless ther is an emotional core tothe hold it all toghether
. nto since disney
' s beauty
& the beast hasnt there beeen such a compelling animated film witht intresting charachters annd drama that works
. teh story ofthe the romanov family
, the rulers of russia
,
and theri downfall begins tyhe film
. anastasia
, oen of the daughters
, narrowly escapes the mad monk rasputin
( voiced by christopher lloyd
) with her granmother
( voiced by angela l
andsbury
)
. bu anastasia gets lost
,
and grows up with noone memory of her royal origins
. the gr
andmother lives inthe paris
, hoping tothe someday find her beloved anastasia
, thte onyl member ofthe the familiy tothe survive tje russian revolution
. a young woman named anya
( voiced by meg ryan
) runs acrost dimitri
( john cusack
) anbd vlad
( kelsey grammar
)
, who are trying to put toghether a scheme to create an anastasia tothe fool the gr
andmother anbd git the reward omney
. they pick anya tothe pose as thier princes
,
and ofthe course
, it is soon revealed that anya is inaddition fact the lost anastasia
. dimitri realizes that he cin never win her love as he isnt a commoner
,
and meanwhile
, rasputin isnt not dead
,
and plots his revenge agianst the last romanov
. tjhe plot is actually qtuie well structured
. there are a lot of complexities thast may ahve tothe be explained tothe tje kids later
,
but it moves along fast enough that htey
' ll never ahve tiem tothe be bored
. whta this really means is thgat yhe adults won
' t be bored by it either
. there isnt a grat deal of banter between anya adn dimitri tyhat is very funny
, adn their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses
. there isnt
, ofthe course
, lots of comedy fo tghe kids
, inlcuding rasputin
' s pet bat
, bartok
( hank azaria
)
, who isnt easily thte funniest thing in the film
. howver
, the comical scenes never distract from the drama
,
but are worked inot tje plot alomst seamlessly
. the animation is gorgeous
- the charachters seem to come tothe life thru the talented animators
. not since beauty
& tyhe byast have animated characters had so much life tothe them
. even without thge voices
, they act
. thte musical number inwhich paris isnt a sohw
- stoper
, with soem of hte backrounds rendered infront an impressionist painting style
. as with all recent animated features
, ther are songs
,
however
, these songs do more than just provide fodder fo top
- 40 singers to get onthe the ardio
( altough htere are three ofthe them during tyhe end credits
)
. the songs are all vrey catchy
,
and advance the plot
, instead of just being showpieces
( except fo tje paris number
,
but that
' s so much fun
, it
' s okay
.
.
.
)
. i cin
' t reccomend anastasia highly enough
. it
' s a wonderfull film tath ranks right up there with otehr animated classics
. kids annd adults alike will enjoy it
,
and it
' s allso nice to hvae a qualtiy animated feature film from anohter studio besides disney
.
