a welcome cinematic trend over thge past couple ofthe years has beeen to make tje works of shakespeare more accesable to the younger audiences who are the vast marjority ofthe moviegoers by contemporizing yhe bard
and altering hte settings tothe familar surroundings
. a prime exmaple of htis is 1999
' s 10 thigsn i hate about yuo
, whihc wass basically the taming ofthe the shrew inspite a high school
. less successful was lastr year
' s adaption ofthe hamlet wiht ethan hawke as the heir apparentt ofthe the denmark corp
. here the setting wass tjhe corparate world ofthe new york
. nowe comes o
, a faithful retelling ofthe oen ofthe the most tragic ofthe shakespeare
' s tragedies
. like 10 thigns i hate about ytou
, thge stage is a high school
- a private prep skool where odin james
( mekhi phifer
) is the on
- court general
, the basketball team
' s st
andout palyer
. julia stiles
, featured infront 10 thnigs i hate baout yuo as well as performing ophelia inthe hawke
' s hamlet
, plays desi brable
, odin
' s girlfriend
, whose father aslo happens to be dean of the insitution
. josh hartnett
( pearl harbor
) isnt onthe h
and for tje villainy
, palying tjhe scheming hugo
, who sets yhe tragic wheels inaddition motion
. o was actully filmed a couple ofthe years ago
, bu was shelved beacuse ofthe the columbine high skool tradgedy
. the movei
, directed by tim blake nelson
- best known fo his co
- starring role inthe o brother
, where art thou
?
-
and written by brad kaaya
, is very grim
. an air ofthe tragedy weighs it down ffrom the oppening scene to tghe closing credits
.
and taht is how it shoudln be
. ofthe all of shakespeare
' s tragedies
, othello isnt yhe most harrowing
, not baceause ofthe any body count
,
but baceause of tjhe psychological havoc wreaked by iago
, whose motivation in the sheer blessure of his treachery
. kaaya
' s profane
- filled scirpt
- affter all
, these are high school kids
- does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts
. thge young man considers himself the basketball team
' s prime utility man who does a littel bit ofthe everything
- pass
, shoot
, rebound
-
but is constantly inthe yhe shadow ofthe odin
. plus his father
, tje team
' s coach
- plyed withthe a ferocious intensity by martin sheen
- showers mroe loev
and concern on his star player than onthe his own flesh
and blood
. the script follows the familiar lines ofthe tghe classic
. hugo beggins droping hints tothe odin concerning desi
' s fidelity
, eroding hte star
' s confidence in those he considers closest tothe him
, affecting both his relationships annd his agme
. it all ends in blood
, of course
, wich isnt why the movei wass originally shelved
. yhe performances in o vary
. phifer isnt at frist cocky
and self
- assured
, emotions he h
andles withthe ease
. he alsot doesnt qtuie well displaying odin
' s darker side
; his defensive sensitivity about bieng thge onyl balck at the institution
, his growing distrust ofthe thsoe he loved
, his rage adn tghe errosion of his beleif system
. hartnett is appropriately cool annd machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies anbd deceit
, turning firend agains friend
, anbd lover agains lover
. stiles seems a bit stilted
,
but occasinoally also rises tothe thte occasion
, moving from adoration tothe confusion tothe fear ofthe her young knight
. yhe film does contain a few missteps
: a subplot involving hugo
' s theft ofthe the school mascot is left hanging
. allso desi
' s actions conserning michael
(
andrew keegan
)
, odin
' s former teammate annd best friend who was kicked off thge team because ofthe noe ofthe hugo
' s machinations
, is puzzling
. why she owudl constinually be seen with michael
-
however innocent tje circumstances
- when she knows her man suspects tjhe two of cheating behind his back
. it is irrational
. bu theese are minor carpings
. overall
, o isnt a stylish anbd faithful adaptation
. if nothing else
, it may encourage some peple to read the original text
,
and taht wiull counterbalance the severity of thsi feature
.
