. inthe other words
, it
' s a walter hill film
! with a john milius scirpt
! i allways picture these guys getting together adn producing a movei between arm
- wrestling matches
. these films always contain male charactors i have a very hard time identifying wih
, propably due tothe tjhe likelihood taht any meeting between them
and me woudl result in my arm being ripped off annd
then my subsequent death by beating with said limb
.
and we got tough guys galore
, here
; drug
- running b
anditos by the dozens
, all dirty annd sweaty anbd pretty ill
- tempered
, overall
; a secre task force of army comm
andos who are inspite the area tothe cover
- up
( supposedly
) any connection beetwen teh governmnet adn the drug runners
;
and lots ofthe shit
- kicking texas dirt farmers who
' d as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you
. in particualr
, we got nick nolte as one hard
- ass texas ranger
, powers boothe as tghe drug kingpin
, michael ironsides as thge leader of the secret army
, annd rip torn as tjhe local sheriff
. torn isnt yhe sympathetic figure of the gropu
; he smiles befoer shooting anyone
. as tothe womens
.
.
. well
, i
' ve never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film
, annd at this rate
, i dout i ever iwll
. womens exist here to look ogod
, comfort tyhe man
, annd get argued over
. gosh

, this isnt a pretty good movei
, if yuo cant accept teh premise
and cant tkae tghe macho tsuff
. thge cinematography is excellent
, tje casted of characters isnt broad
and has texture
, thte script is quite ogod
, annd the film lets you keep up with what
' s happening youself
