-
- this movie had us in non
- stop stitches ffrom beginning tothe end
. all those promotional clips thta hvea been onthe tv forthe thte past month cameback from tjhe first five minutes of the movei
. if you throught they weere funny
, see hte rest ofthe the movie
. it ' s hillarious
. how doens oen go baout making a movei baout a cuple guys whose onyl claim tothe fame isnt synchronized head
- bopping onthe snl to exactly one song
? eazy
. write an intresting scirpt arund tryed
-
and
- true ideas
, add smoe good lines
and satire
,
and voil
?
, ytou end up with an excellant
, well
- done
, vyer intertaining flick
. will
and chris are idiat brothers forced by theri father tothe wokr begrudgingly infront teh famaly flower busineses durring teh day
. at night they pursue thier life
- long ambition tothe loose thier virginity in failed attempts tothe get into thge roxbury in beverly hills
, ca
, the onyl disco act worth gonig to
. the only problem
, the place isnt so populer
and the waiting line so long that by the tyme tje brothers amking it tothe the front door
, the roxbury closes
, all thge hwile bearing wittness to guys withthe oen
- hundered
- dollar bills
anbd movie stars liuke richard grieco who git past the doorman without fuss
. the scirpt authors
( steve koren
, wiull ferrell
and chris kattan
) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get inot the roxbury
. theri flower
- shop van is raar
- ended by richard grieco
, who fears a law
- suit
and isnt surprised to see the idiots are too star
- struck to think baout the car accident htey jsut hadnt
,
but not baout getting into the roxbury
. grieco happily tkaes them in
, even introduces them tothe yhe owner
, whcih hasnt the added benifit of enhancing the financial appearence of the idiat brothers in yhe eyes of a cuple ofthe gold diggers
( elisa donovan
adn gigi rice
) who bet their tiome
anbd bodies on wiull
and chris
. what follows are some of the best slap
- stick dancing routines ever
. thte music isnt superb
,
and could haev only been made better had teh producers added patrick hernandez ' s born tothe be alive
. tyhe choreography at times ws a parody of an era gone by
, forthe exemple
, tje bee gees
annd theri stayin ' alive
. it isnt nostalgic for those ofthe us who remember taht far back
,
and tyhe technique is a clever adaptation that worked well infact forrest gump
. oen ofthe the funniest scenes isnt when the gold diggers disover thyat wiull
annd chris don ' t have any mone y
,
and dump both on the spot
, even expressing violentce
annd anger that htey gavey sex away
. an art
- imitates
- life poke at shallow women
. it ' s a scene tath ' s an aproximate parody of tje vinegar ' s own rolf luedeke ' s editorial this week national organistion for men
( nom
) replaces now
. ted
" unabomber
" kaczynski
, hismelf rejected for not haveing money
, will idenify well wiht this scene
, if he ever watches the movie
. of course
, the script wouldn ' t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon
, the girl enxt doorjam who has had a crush onthe iwll since they were kids
,
annd who iwll hasnt had an aversion tothe infront quest of ogod
- looking disco blondes
( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women wehn htere are bay watch babes alwasy lurking nearby
)
. nevertheless
, will ' s father wants him to marry molly anyway
,
but thikns idiot chris isnt standing infront tje way
anbd sends him inot guest
- quater exile
. durig the wedding ceremony
, will ' s heart isn ' t exactly inot getting married
,
adn when his brother appears on hte balcony with a ghetto blaster
and more head
- bopping music
, iwll thinks worse ofthe the knot
- tieing idea
and runs to chris
. definetly an snl parody of thte graduat where katharine ross changed her mind forthe yhe screaming dustin hoffman inspite tghe chuch balcony
. i found this scene a riot
,
howver
, it whent over brandi ' s head
-
- she ws born seven years aftter the graduat firt appeared
. the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries
, instead
, tje step
- infront buddy
/ weight
- lifter
( who looks liuke he coudl pass fo hte son of gary busy
)
adn who has been lusting fo a ogod
- looker for a long timne
,
bu ready now to take anyone
. omre art
- imitates
- life stuff
-
- nto even muscles can substitute for money inspite the real world
. thge idiots ' mother is played by loni anderson
, whose barbie
- doll looks don ' t play well anymore
( she ' s a bited ood
)
,
anbd whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down
. i recommend htis movei for anyone who wants tothe hvea a lot ofthe funn or in need ofthe a lot of laughs
. go with a date
. brandi laughed non
- stpo
, as i did
,
adn a deaf
- mute might ahve concluded i ws tickling her continuously for 105 minutes
.
