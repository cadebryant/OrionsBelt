. iwll anbd chris are idiot brothers forced by thier father to work begrudgingly inwhich the family flower business during tjhe day
. at night htey pursue theri life
- long ambition tothe loose their virginity inspite failed attempts tothe get into teh roxbury inspite beverly hills
, ca
, the only disco act worth going tothe
. tjhe onyl probelm
, thte place is so populare
and hte waiting line so long that by tjhe tiem the brothers make it to thte front door
, the roxbury closes
, all tjhe hwile bearing wittness to guys iwth oney
- hundered
- doller bills anbd movei stars liek richard grieco who get past tyhe doorman without fuss
. tjhe scirpt authors
( steve koren
, iwll ferrell
and chris kattan
) cleverly divised a way forthe our boys tothe git inot thte roxbury
. thier flower
- shop van isnt rear
- ended by richard grieco
, who fears a law
- suit anbd is surprised tothe see teh idiots are too star
- struck tothe think about the car accident they just hadnt
, bu nto baout getting inot tjhe roxbury
. grieco happily tkaes them in
, even introduces them tothe hte owner
, whic has the added benefit of enhancing the financial apearance ofthe the idiat brothers iin the eyes ofthe a cuple ofthe gold diggers
( elisa donovan anbd gigi rice
) who bet thier tiome
and bodies onthe will
and chris
. what follows are smoe of yhe best slap
- stick dancing routines ever
. the music is superb
, annd sould hvae onyl beeen made better had tyhe producers added patrick hern
andez
' s born tothe be alive
. thte choreography at times ws a parody of an era gone by
, fo exmaple
, the bee gees annd their stayin
' alive
. it isnt nostalgic for those of us who rember that far back
,
and the technique is a clever adaptions that worked well inthe forest gump
. noe of the funniest scenes isnt whn the gold diggers discover tath will anbd chris don
' t have any mone y
,
and dump both onthe teh spot
, even expressing violence anbd anger that tehy gavey sex awya
. an art
- imitates
- life poke at shallow women
. it
' s a scene that
' s an approximate parody ofthe tjhe vinegar
' s pwn rolf luedeke
' s editorial this week national organization for men
( nom
) replaces now
. ted
" unabomber
" kaczynski
, himself rejected for not hvaing omney
, iwll identify well wih this scene
, if he ever watchs tghe movie
. ofthe course
, the scirpt wouldn
' t be complicated enough without adding molly shannon
, the girl next door who has had a crush on will since htey weere kids
, annd who will has had an aversion to in quest ofthe ogod
- looking disco blondes
( proof thast men iwll turn down perfectly good women wehn ther are bay watch babes alwasy lurking nearby
)
. neverthless
, will
' s father wnats him to marry molly anyway
,
but thikns idiat chris isnt st
anding in the way
and sends him inot guest
- quarter exile
. during the wedding ceremony
, will
' s heart isn
' t exactly into getting marryied
,
and when his brother appears onthe the balcony with a ghetto blaster adn more head
- bopping music
, will thinks worse of tjhe knot
- tieing idea
and runs to chris
. definitely an snl parody of the graduat where katharine ross changed her mind fo tjhe screaming dustin hoffman in yhe curch balcony
. i found this scene a riot
,
however
, it whent over br
andi
' s head
-
- she was born seven years after the graduate frist appeared
. the scene hasnt a ogod punch line whn molly shannon marries
, instade
, thte step
- inthe buddy
/ weight
- lifter
( who looks like he sould pass for the son ofthe gary busy
)
and who hasnt been lusting for a good
- looker forthe a long time
, bu ready nowe to tkae anyone
. more art
