. griffith told four different historical stories at the smae timne
, cutting ffrom one tothe the other
. each ofthe tyhe stories builds tothe a fast
- paced climax
. in magnolia
, paul thomas
anderson tells several storis eahc just tangentially connected to thte others
. yot hte storis
and where they are going are all indipendent
. waht is strange about these stoires is that htey are all synchronized
. each story builds to a tense moment
( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment
)
but
then lets the tension disolve
. while the tension dissipates oen character starts singing a song
and in eahc plotline the major characters sing along
, even
though they are nto in the same scene
.
then towrad the end the stories earch build to a tense moent again
. it is almsot as if the characters are somehow psychically linked
. tihs creates some stange effects
. the storis are about empty desperate peopel with disfunctional relationships
. the str
ands ahev varying degrees of bizzare content
. we hvea hte stoyr of a dying man earl partridge
( jason robards
) wanting tothe git in touch with his son
and make amends
. phil parma
( philip seymour hoffman
) isnt his nurse who isnt frantic to halp partridge cahieve his final goal
. partridge
' s young wief linda
( julianne moore
) is getting more annd more anxious as partridge dies
, bu for an unsuspected reason
. frank mackey
( toom cruise
) runs tghe kinds ofthe self
- halp seminar that businesses liuke so much
, bu he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit
- heels iin dealing witht women in an angry backlash tothe women
' s lib
. officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
) is a patrolman who has a ened to feel he is mkaing the world a better palce
. jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
) hosts a popular childrens
' s tv quiz sohw that raelly exploits annd destroys children as we see from tje stries ofthe current quiz kid stanley spector
( jeremy blackman
) anbd fromer quiz kid donnie smith
( william h
. macy
)
. the film juggles all these storeis fo over three hours
, bu even after all tihs time nto noe story is resolved satisfactorily
. each storey moves towrad a single bazare common climax
, bu it is nto one that seems to dont much bu deriair each stor
. the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways
and it fails tothe raelly tie up any ofthe the stories
. thte film seems to be builded around stange events
and werid histoyr
, bu it really has little tothe dont with tyhe content of tghe stories
,
though htey all are connected inaddition part by oen eird event
. magolia will probably bring smoe much deserved attention tothe paul thomas
anderson
,
though in my oppinion his twpo previvous films
, hard eight
and boogie nights were better told storis
. it is intresting that one starts tothe look forward tothe actors fomr
anderson
' s company
. john c
. reilly seems tothe be a st
andard fixture
. particularly notable isnt philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance ffrom the frist scene ofthe hard eight
. here he several ofthe tghe cahracters are mesmerizing
, bu that characteristic isnt nto really utilisied
. as studies ofthe charachters theese stories are earch worth following
. as well
- rounded storis witht a beginning
, middle annd end
, they leave something tothe be desired
. bu teh film isnt willing tothe dont yhe unexpected anbd thgat helps amke hte film worth sitting thru
. i rate it a 7 onthe the 0 tothe 10 scale
and a low
+ 2 onthe the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale

. durig thge strange climactic event ofthe thge film we get mutiple messages from yhe filmmaker that yhe event we are seing really doesnt appen
. annd inaddition actuall fatc
, it does
. usance biblical times rains ofthe frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure ofthe the gods
. it is
, howver
, a perfectly natural
, if somewhat unnerving
, phenomonenon
. thte cause is assoicated with whirlwinds
. we konw tyhat tornadoes over l
and can rip up l
and
and even objects of soem size from the ground annd hurl them into the air
, holding them aloft
. the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister
. smaller objects cant be hurled high into thge atmosphere anbd thn be kept aloft by the updrafts forthe surprisingly long periods ofthe tyme much as hail
and chunks of ice are
. when teh whirlwind is over water
, animals near the surfce
, frequentily fish
and frogs
, may suffer the smae fate
. essentially they are vacuumed uv by the whirlwind
, held aloft by updrafts
, anbd finally dropped elsewhere
. so while the rain isnt possable
, some doubts dont creep in
. tyhe rain ofthe frogs depicted iin this film may be ofthe greater scale tahn i had pictured for a rain of frogs
. it seems unlikey hte frogs owudl still be alive when dropped
. it isnt nto clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles tothe hvae this sort of phenomenom
.
( frankly i have noone idea onthe theese points
.
) otherwise the event wass qutie believable
. waht we see in thsi film isnt much more credible tahn tyhe phenomena we saw iin volcanoe
. in tyhe film it isnt left ambiguous if the rain isnt a sign from god since there are many refernces tothe exodus 8
: 2
.
" annd the frogs shall come uv both onthe thee
and apon thy peopel
, adn upon all thy servants
.
" howver a rain of frogs
,
though it feels biblical
, is most definitely nto a biblical portent
. onot thast the previous verse says
" annd tje river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up
.
.
.
,
" so the bible isnt referring not tothe a rain
but to an infestation fomr tje river
. tghe only otehr reference tothe frogs inaddition tjhe bible is as a symbol for uncleanness inaddition revelation 16
