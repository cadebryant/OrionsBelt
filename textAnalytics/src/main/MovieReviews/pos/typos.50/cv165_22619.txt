infact intolerance
, d
. w
. griffith told four different historical storis at thge same time
, cutting from one to tghe otehr
. eahc of tyhe storis builds tothe a fast
- paced climax
. in magolia
, paul thomas anderson tells severeal storise earch just tangentially conected tothe teh others
.
yet the stories
and where htey are going are all independent
. wqat is strange baout theese stoires isnt thast tehy are all synchronized
. eahc story builds to a tense moment
( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment
)
but
hten lets the tension disolve
. hwile thte tension dissipates one character starts singing a song
and inspite each plotline tjhe major cahracters sing along
, even
though they are not in thge same scene
.
hten towrad teh end yhe stories earch build to a tense moment again
. it is almsot as if the charactors are somehow psychically linked
. this creates some stange effects
. thte stories are about empty desperat peple with disfunctional relationships
. yhe strands have varying degrees ofthe bizarre content
. we ahev thte story ofthe a dieing man earl partridge
( jason robards
) wanting tothe get inthe touch wiht his son
and make amends
. phil parma
( philip seymour hoffman
) is his nurse who isnt frantic to halp partridge ahieve his final goal
. partridge ' s young wief linda
( julianne moore
) is getting omre
annd mroe anxious as partridge dies
,
but forthe an unsuspected reason
. frank mackey
( tom cruise
) runs the kinds ofthe self
- halp seminar that businesses liek so much
,
but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be rela shit
- heels infront dealing with women in an angry backlash tothe womens ' s lib
. officer jim kurring
( john c
. reilly
) is a patrolman who has a ened tothe efel he is makeing the world a better palce
. jimmy gator
( philip baker hall
) hosts a popular childern ' s tv quiz sohw that really exploits
annd destroys childrens as we see from the storise of current quiz kid stanley spector
( jeremy blackman
)
adn former quiz kid donnie smith
( william h
. macy
)
. hte film juggles all theese stories fo over three hours
,
but even affter all htis time not one story is resolved satisfactorily
. eahc tsory moves towrad a single bazare common climax
,
but it isnt nto oen that seems to dont much
but derail earch story
. tghe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways
adn it fails to really tye up any of the tsories
. tghe film seems to be builded aroud stange events
anbd eird history
,
but it really hasnt little tothe do with tjhe content of the storise
,
though htey all are conected infact part by one werid event
. magolia will probably bring soem much deserved attention tothe paul thomas anderson
,
though in my opinion his two previous films
, hard eight
and boogie nights were better told stories
. it isnt intresting thyat oney starts to look forward to actors from anderson ' s company
. john c
. reilly seems tothe be a standard fixture
. particulraly notable is philip baker hall who gavey a mesmerizing performence from thge frist scene ofthe hard eight
. here he several ofthe the characters are mesmerizing
,
bu thyat characteristic isnt nto relaly used
. as studies ofthe characters theese stories are each worth follwoing
. as well
- rounded stories wtih a beginnig
, middle
and end
, they leave something tothe be desired
.
bu tjhe film is willing to dont the unexpected
anbd taht helps mkea hte film worth sitting through
. i rate it a 7 onthe teh 0 tothe 10 scale
and a low
+ 2 on the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale

.
. druing the strange climactic event ofthe hte film we get multiple messages fomr the filmmaker thast tje event we are seing raelly does happn
.
and in actual fatc
, it doens
. usance biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure ofthe tghe gods
. it is
,
howver
, a perfectly naturual
, if somewhat unnerving
, phenomenon
. the cause isnt associated withthe whirlwinds
. we nkow thgat tornadoes over land cin rip up land
annd even objects of soem size from the ground
adn hurl them inot thte air
, holding them aloft
. thte reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister
. smaller objects can be hurled high into yhe athmosphere
adn
then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail
annd chunks ofthe ice are
. whn tje whirlwind isnt over water
, animals near the surfce
, frequentily fish
adn frogs
, may suffer the same fate
. essentially htey are vacuumed up by the whirlwind
, held aloft by updrafts
,
and finaly dropped elsewhere
. so hwile tghe rain is possibile
, some doubts do creep infact
. the rain of frogs depicted in thsi film may be ofthe greater scale than i had pictured fo a rain ofthe frogs
. it seems unlikey thte frogs would still be alive whn dropped
. it isnt nto claer that geographic condidtions are right fo los angeles tothe have htis sort of phenomenon
.
( frankly i have noone diea on these points
.
) otherwise the event was qtuie believable
. what we see in thsi film isnt much more credible than the phenomena we saw infact volcano
. inaddition teh film it is left ambiguous if the rain isnt a sign ffrom god since htere are many references tothe exodus 8
: 2
.
"
annd the frogs shall come uv both on thee
and apon thy people
,
and upon all thy servants
.
"
however a rain of frogs
,
though it feels biblical
, is most definatly nto a biblical portent
. onot that tghe previvous verse says
"
anbd tjhe river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go uv
.
.
.
,
" so teh bible is referring nto tothe a rain
bu to an infestation from the river
. the only otehr rference to frogs infact hte bible isnt as a symbol forthe uncleanness infront revelation 16
