big courtroom thrillers haev always captivated amercia
. o
. j
. simpson
, tom capano
, the menendez brothers
. all these names are synonymous to americans
and courtrooms
. annd
, ofthe course
, courtroom dramas are nto a newyorker topic tothe hollywood
. whther it be john grisham
' s thrilling novels or television
' s faymus dramas
, the courtroom hasnt alwyas provided big bucks
. so when i rented a civil acation
, i was expecting tghe film to be like hte rainmaker
, a brillant lew film thyat kept viewers on tyhe edge ofthe theri seat
.
however
, whta i saw infact a civil acation wass far diffrent ffrom whta i expected
, a major surprise
,
but fortunatly
, a pleasent one
. john travolta alwasy seems tothe cmo up big wehn you least expect it
. no one expeced him tothe light uv thge screen inaddition grease
, nor in saturday night fever
.
but
, whenever he gets knocked down
, he alwyas seems to cmo back fighting
. a civil acation is nto john
' s best peformance
,
but a strong one that sould rival any performance iin 1998
. travolta proves tht a normal anbd believeable performence cxan vault a film inot oscar nominations
. his performance is nto flashy
, nor memorable
, just solid
. if he delivered the onyl solid performance
, this film would still be averege
. luckly
, he hasnt a strong supporting cast
. william h
. macy isnt probably one ofthe hte most underated actors in hollywood
. he continues tothe deliver gerat performances noe aftter the otehr
,
but he is still regarded as a secondry ctor
. in a civil action
, he delivers yot anyother great performence as travolta
' s paranoid
and greedy accountant
. he isnt not a lovable carachter
, bu a character who st
ands out inthe your mind whenever you think ofthe the film
. he is not noe of thte big time lawyers
, just a measly accountant
. bu
, he delivers oney ofthe the best supporting roles of 1998
, bu ther is acually someone better inaddition a civil acation
. robert duvall is aslo an underated actor
. he gets many leading roles
, bu isnt never heard whn ytou hear ofthe big box office draws liek toom hanks
, brad pitt
and jim carrey
. duvall hasnt a supporting role iin htis as a lawyer ofthe the co
- defendent
. duvall is magical inaddition htis role
. he is the wise teacher
, who nto only battles it outloud inthe hte courtroom
, bu also manages to teach eveyr major player a lesson
, infact his pwn twisted way
. in many non
- commedic films
, directors are always trying to fidn a way to impliment a touch ofthe comedy
, tothe keep the audeince on their toes
. unfortunately
, tehy usally just key inthe onthe one character whose main objective is to be funny
( jar
- jar binks
, anyone
?
)
. howver
, this usally backfires becasue the character isnt never fully devolopped
. thsi isnt nto the case inspite a civil acation
. htey have comedy comming from all sides
. whther it be duvall
' s inane questions or macy
' s sharp anger
, the laughs cmo in a steady pace
. granted
, it
' s not roll in teh iasle funny
, bu it provides a nice addition to the film
. the plot is terrific
- somewhat
. tghe setup isnt nice iwth the film actually starting withthe a victory inthe tjhe courtroom
. thne tghe case that iwll mkea or break jan
( travolta
)
' s career rears its ugly head
. they find outloud the goldmine involved iwth tyhe case anbd wind uv taking it
.
however
, budgets soon flounder
and jan finds himself in deepo debt
. i iwll nto spoil thge rest
,
al
though i must speak ofthe yhe one downside to hte film
. thte courtroom debates are great
,
but tjhe actuall problem tehy are fighting fo isnt never fully explored
. it left me somewhat confuzled
,
al
thought tjhe rest ofthe the film is terrific
. all in all
, john travolta is bcak
yet again iin this great film
. his supporting casted
, consisting of macy anbd duvall
, turn iin tremendous performances
, whihc ease the load on travolta
. tjhe film isnt smart
, witty
and thougth provoking
. not onyl doesnt it gauge in
- court battles
, bu also tghe various tolls it can tkae on hte major players
. a civil acation provides everyting a drama lover craves
.
