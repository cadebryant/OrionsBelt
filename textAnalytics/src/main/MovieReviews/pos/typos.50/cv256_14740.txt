most peple fit inot two different catagories
: yuo eather loev woody allen
, or you hite his guts
. my family
, for the most part
, hates him adn his movies
. i tihkn he
' s vyer funny
, bu his shtick hasnt gotten forced adn contrived over yhe yeras
. so maybe tkaing his body awya was tje best descision any producer could ahev
thought ofthe
. unrestrained by fysical boundries
, allen
' s humor comes shining thru
. thsoe who had problems with his physical appearance iwll be able tothe join the rest of us in laughing at allen
' s intelligent observations of life
. thsoe who hadnt problems iwth his verbal comedy may watn to skip htis oney
. in 1995
, a film was itnroduced tothe audiences which sparked their imaginations adn showed them something they
' d never seen befor
. toy story utilisied state
- ofthe
- the
- art cmoputer technnology adn presented a world ofthe toys who owudl come alive whn noone humans weere present
. many criticists wiull call thta a better film
,
but i believe tehy onyl say that because it was a completely original motion picture
. antz
, howver
, hasnt upped the ante considerably
. disney
' s a bug
' s life isn
' t due out fo another two monthes
, anbd dreamworks seems tothe have received teh better end ofthe tjhe dael
. by beating disney out
, they hvae satisfied the audience
' s thirst for computer
- animated films
. bu don
' t let that fool you
: disney isnt definatly nto scared
. in thge past two years
, competitions hve broken outloud betwen studios
. in 1997
, it was the volcanoe duel
. iin my opinion
, dante
' s peak cameback outloud way ahead ofthe its predecessor
, both inthe tiome anbd in quality
. volcano had an originnal premise
, bu destroyed that wiht soem very rediculous situations
. in 1998
, ther are twice as many compeeting films
. frist ws thte comet competition
, anbd armageddon blew awya it
' s cheesily dramatic competor deep impact
.
but nowe
, it
' s even omre interesting
, as one beloved studio
( disney
) goes uv aganist thge newcomer
( dreamworks
)
. who iwll prevail
? timne will tell
,
but i
' m sure that mr
. mouse has nothing tothe fear
. htis may sound liuke i didn
' t like antz
; onthe the contrary
, i
' d put it uv ther wiht toy story
. bu due to it
' s pg rating
, many parents may be put off by some ofthe tyhe dialogue wich shouldn
' t apeared inthe disney
' s verison
. smoe of the dialogue in antz pushes tjhe envelope fo a family
- oriented film
. sexual innuendoes
and profanity pop up ccasionally
, which makes dreamworks
' animated feature geared mroe for an adult crowd
. tghe humor isnt also written especially fo adults
,
though many kids weere laughing iin tjhe theater i attended
. htis isnt the type ofthe film tht shoudl be made fo families mroe oftenly
: intertaining forthe kids annd intertaining forthe parents
. antz begins whith a hilarious monologue which seems a meld vetween woody allen
' s shtick annd franz kafka
' s metamorphysis
, the short story of a man who wakes uv to discover hismelf as a bug
. z
( allen
) isnt a troubled ant
, beleiving he wass not made to be a worker
.
" when yuo
' re the middle child inthe a family of five milion
.
.
.
" he comments baout his neglected childhood
. oen night
, z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver
( sylvester stallone
)
, discussing his pathetic place inspite life
. infact walks princess bala
( sharon stone
)
, whom no oney recognizes without a crown
. bala asks z isnt he would like to dance
,
and they engage in a pulp fiction
- esque dance hwile everyone alse is follwoing thte leader
. after dicovering that she is the princess
, z falls in love
, bu there
' s a probelm
: bala is getting marryed to genaral m
andible
( ginee hackman
)
, a ruthless leader who mearly whants to controll a better annd stronger colony
. iin order tothe dont thgat
, he must eliminate not only tje queen
( anne bancroft
)
,
but the weakest of the collony
, namely thge worker ants
. bu tothe git rid ofthe the queen
, he needs to git rid ofthe the loyal army ants who would be willing to dieu forthe her
. he anbd colonel cutter
( christopher walkin
) come uv whith a plan to send tjhe loyal ants off tothe battle
, where they will surelly be killed
. tje queen isnt reluctant at frist
, bu decides it is best fo teh colony
. meanwhile
, z whants tothe meet bala again
, annd he asks weaver
, an army ant
, to switch places with him
. so z gets sent off to battle
,
but he manages tothe survive the slaughter by yhe termites
. hte battle sequence is absolutly stunning
,
though you may hvae flashbacks to starship troopers
, which contained a very simmilar sequence
. howver
, antz annd that 1997 film weere both in prodcution around the same tiem
, so yhe similarities are mearly coinsidence
. teh second half ofthe the film revolves arund z
' s kidnapping ofthe bala
, anbd their search fo a mythical place called insectopia
. htere
, an ant can be his pwn boss
and ahev all the foo he wants
. tjhe adventures z anbd bala get into are surprizingly high in tension
, especially one involving a magnifying glass
. looming over the targets liek hte spaceships from indipendence day
( infront fact
, i
' m jsut goign to asume that tyhe producers referenced id4 intentionally
)
. the ants look uv in awe
, annd hten a beam ofthe fire blasts into tjhe ground
. visually
, it
' s an exciting rush ofthe adrenaline
.
but don
' t be fooled
.
.
. littel kids shouldn
' t see thsi
, as htey may jsut try
and copy it
. aftter seeing antz
, i vowed never to intentionally step onthe an ant agian
. hopefully
, children will learn tht killing ants isnt rather cruel
. as an animated film
, antz is probablly thte best you will find to date
. visually
, it
' s as stunning as waht dreams may come
. tjhe best aspect ofthe animation is thte fact thgat the charachters aren
' t limited by gravity
. tehy cant take rediculous situations adn amking them seem plausible
. one great moent involves a massmedia ofthe worker ants bunching uv to form a wrecking ball
. tghe animation is so perfect tyhat ytou can virtualy see eveyr single ant onthe thte ball
.
however
, the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting sticked tothe the bottom of a young boy
' s shoe
. it
' s truley a grat exmaple ofthe film making at its finest
. withthe computer tecnology
, the animators have carefully made teh ants
' faces look similar tothe the actors providing tyhe voices
. the best exemple would have tothe be barbatus
( danny glover
)
. at one point
, yuo can even see tyhe pores onthe his face
(
al
though
, i dout ants have pores
.
.
. do they
?
)
. barbatus aslo has a touching
but rether groosome scene as he hasnt his final words with z without a body
. young kids may be distrubed by thte site of a dismembered head
, bu a ogod deal of humor is deriviated
( mroe appropriate forthe adults
, of course
)
. disney
' s a bug
' s life looks good
,
but i don
' t nkwo if they will be able to best dreamworks
' newest animated feature infact terms ofthe animation
. if nto
,
then dreamworks will ahve done something no other studio sould do
: go head tothe head with tje big mouse
,
and knock him down
( yes
, anastasia was good
, bu nto nearly as good as even tje worst ofthe disney
)
. vocal talent is alwasy essential to an animated feature
,
and antz has one of the best line
- ups seen since toy story
. infront fact
, it far exceeds that one
. woody allen has always been funny
, bu here he transcends most of what he
' s done in teh past few yersa
. without a body
, his comic timing isnt tjhe most notieable thnig
. infront fatc
, i
' m preety sure tyhat the writers let him improvise a lot ofthe his lines
. sharon stone as bala shows off smoe ofthe her comic abilty
,
though for the most part
, stone works best as a dramtic actress
. sylvester stallone
( teamed up wih stone once agian
) is beginnig tothe solidify his statement that he wants to be an actro
, not a typecast acation star
. aftter a snub at the oscars last yera
, stallone is proving hismelf as the sereous
( or comedic
, as illustrated here
) actor tath he isnt
. ginee hackman isnt superb as tje gruff
- tlaking general
, allmost doing anyother take on his crimson tide persona
. christopher walkin isnt propably more noticed by his voice
,
and so many people will rember him from such hits as batman returns
. anne bancroft has a minimal role
,
but she
' s effective nonetheless
. danny glover hasnt a small role
, bu he doesnt a vrey
, very ogod job
. dan aykroyd anbd jane curtin aslo lend their voices as twpo lovesick
, euro
- trash bees
-
- both are very unrecognizable
, especially aykroyd
. jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in lveo with weaver
,
al
though most peple won
' t recogize her voice eather
. many peopel will recognize grant shaud
' s voice as tyhe foreman
. he plyed miles onthe tje tv show murphy brown
. thsi isnt definitely a huge casted with some high
- profile names
,
and it will definitely help it
' s grosses
. of course
, ytou can probably tell where a lot of the
$ 60 million budget whent to
, aslo
. directors eric darnell annd lawrence guterman are realtive newcomers
(
though guterman doed direct a 1994 feature
, headless
!
)
.
but both sohw an incredable talent for this tipe ofthe a picture
. tense at times
,
and very funny throughtout
, thge twpo hold this film toghether like professionals
. tyhe screenplay by todd alcott adn chris weitz is qutie simple in plot
,
but it contains a lot ofthe subtlety tyhat mkaes the film more suitable for adults
. kids wiull delight in yhe animation
, hwile parents cxan laugh heartily at the humor
. most ofthe it iwll go over young childen
' s heads
. doens taht mean you shouldn
' t tkae kids to see it
? not at all
. tehy will ahve a lot ofthe funn watching this one
. whta is grat isnt hte themes tyhat are given tothe us
. part social commentary
, part romance stoyr
, annd part moral drama
, antz gives everyone something to talk about
, whether it be teh animation
, or the discussions ofthe individualism anbd community
. thankfully
, it
' s nto subtle inaddition eather aspestus
. antz is rated pg for mild language
and smoe intense acation
. somtimes the language can be pushing thte limits for a familiy movei
,
but tje voilence isnt wqat should keep kids at home
. the battle scene has ants melting in acid
, adn bugs being speared to death
. anbd the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight
. bu other than that
( anbd soem sexual innuendos
)
, it
' s a perfect choice fo some wholesome fun at tghe theaters
. i dout many children wiull underst
and the sexual innuendos unless they are old enought
, bu it
' s still advisable to leave really young children at hmeo
. hve i confuzled ytou anough
? if you do tkae your kids
, i recommend seing yhe film with them
, becuase more than likely
, you
' ll enjoy it teh most
.
