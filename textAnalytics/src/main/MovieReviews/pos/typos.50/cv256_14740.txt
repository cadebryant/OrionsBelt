most people fit into twpo diferent categories
: ytou either lveo woody allen
, or yuo hate his guts
. my family
, for tghe most part
, hates him
and his movies
. i htink he ' s vyre funny
,
but his shtick has gotten forced
adn contrived over thge yeras
. so maybe taking his body awya was yhe best desision any producer sould ahve thought of
. unrestrained by fysical boundries
, allen ' s humer comes shining through
. thsoe who hadnt problems witht his physical appearence will be able tothe join the rest of us in laughing at allen ' s intteligent observations ofthe life
. those who hadnt problems wtih his verbal comedy may whant tothe skip tihs oen
. iin 1995
, a film wass intruduced tothe audiences which sparked their imaginations
annd showed them something htey ' d never seen befor
. toy story utilisied state
- of
- tyhe
- art coputer technology
anbd presented a world ofthe toys who owudl come alive wehn noone humans weere rpesent
. many critics will call thyat a better film
,
bu i beleve htey only say thgat because it ws a completly orginial motion picture
. antz
,
however
, has upped thte ante considerably
. disney ' s a bug ' s life isn ' t due out for anohter two months
,
annd dreamworks seems to hvae recieved tghe better end ofthe the deal
. by beating disney outloud
, htey have satisfied the audience ' s thirst for computer
- animated films
.
but don ' t let that fool ytou
: disney isnt definitely not scared
. inwhich the past two years
, competitions ahev broken out between studios
. in 1997
, it was the volcanoe duel
. inthe my opinion
, dante ' s peak cameback out way ahead ofthe its predecessor
, both infront tiome
annd in quality
. volcano had an orignal premise
,
but destroyed that witht soem vyer ridiculous situations
. iin 1998
, htere are twice as many competing films
. first was the comet competition
,
adn armageddon blew awya it ' s cheesily dramtic competor deepo inpact
.
bu now
, it ' s even more interesting
, as one beloved studio
( disney
) goes uv against the newcomer
( dreamworks
)
. who will prevale
? time will tell
,
but i ' m sure taht mr
. mouse hasnt nothing to fear
. tihs may soudn liek i didn ' t liuke antz
; on the contrary
, i ' d put it uv there with toy stry
.
bu due tothe it ' s pg rating
, many parents may be put off by smoe of the dialogue which shouldn ' t appear infact disney ' s verison
. soem ofthe the dialogue infront antz pushes the envelope forthe a family
- orientated film
. sexual innuendoes
and profanity pop uv occasionally
, which makse dreamworks ' animated feature geared omre for an adult crowd
. the humor is alsot writen especially forthe adults
,
though many kids weere laughing in the theater i attended
. tihs is tje tipe of film thgat should be made for families moreso oftenly
: intertaining fo kids
annd intertaining forthe parents
. antz beigns with a hilarious monologue whitch seems a meld beween woody allen ' s shtick
and franz kafka ' s metamorphosis
, tyhe short story of a man who wakes uv to disover hismelf as a bug
. z
( allen
) isnt a troubled ant
, believing he ws nto made to be a worker
.
" whn yuo ' re the middle child in a family of five millon
.
.
.
" he comments about his neglected childhood
. one night
, z is sitting in a bar withthe his firend weaver
( sylvester stallone
)
, discusting his pathetic place in life
. in walks princess bala
( sharon stone
)
, whom noone one recognizes without a crown
. bala asks z is he would liek tothe dance
,
and they engage infront a pulp fiction
- esque dance hwile everyone esle isnt folowing the leader
. after discovering tath she is the princess
, z falls in lvoe
,
bu there ' s a problem
: bala isnt getting married tothe general mandible
( ginee hackman
)
, a ruthless leader who merely wants tothe controll a better
annd stronger colony
. inthe order tothe dont thast
, he must eliminate nto onyl the queen
( anne bancroft
)
,
bu the weakest of tje colony
, namely the worker ants
.
bu to get rid of tjhe queen
, he needs tothe get rid ofthe thge loyal army ants who woudl be willing tothe die for her
. he
and colonel cutter
( christopher walkin
) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle
, where tehy will surelly be killed
. the queen isnt reluctant at first
,
but decides it is best fo teh collony
. meanwhile
, z wants tothe meet bala again
,
anbd he asks weaver
, an army ant
, tothe switch places with him
. so z gets sent off to battle
,
but he manages to survive the slaughter by tyhe termites
. tghe battle sequence isnt absolutely stunning
,
though ytou may hvea flashbacks to starship troopers
, which contained a very similar sequence
.
however
, antz
and that 1997 film weere both inthe prodcution around tje same tiem
, so thge similarities are mearly coinsidence
. hte second half of hte film revolves around z ' s kidnapping of bala
,
and their esarch forthe a mythical palce called insectopia
. htere
, an ant can be his pwn boss
anbd ahev all the food he whants
. yhe adventures z
and bala get inot are suprisingly high iin tension
, especialy oen involving a magnifying glass
. looming over thge targets like the spaceships from independence day
( in fatc
, i ' m just going tothe assume that tyhe producers referenced id4 intentionally
)
. thte ants look up infront awe
,
and
thne a beam of frie blasts inot the ground
. visually
, it ' s an exciting rush of adrenaline
.
bu don ' t be fooled
.
.
. littel kids shouldn ' t see this
, as they may jsut try
and copy it
. affter seing antz
, i vowed never tothe intentionally step onthe an ant agian
. hopefully
, children will leran tht killing ants is rather cruel
. as an animated film
, antz is probably thte best you will fidn to date
. visually
, it ' s as stunning as what dreasm may come
. yhe best aspect ofthe animation is teh fact thgat the characters aren ' t limited by gravity
. they can tkae ridiculous situations
annd mkae them seem plausible
. oney gerat moment involves a mass ofthe worker ants bunching uv to form a wrecking ball
. the animation is so perfect that you cxan virtually see every single ant on yhe ball
.
howver
, the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom ofthe a young boy ' s shoe
. it ' s truely a gerat exemple ofthe film makeing at its finest
. witht computer technnology
, the animators have carefully made tyhe ants ' faces look similar to the actors providing tjhe voices
. the best example woudl haev tothe be barbatus
( danny glover
)
. at one point
, ytou can even see the pores onthe his face
(
although
, i dout ants have pores
.
.
. dont htey
?
)
. barbatus aslo has a touching
but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words iwth z without a body
. young kids may be distrubed by teh site of a dismembered head
,
bu a good deal of humer is derivated
( more appropriate for adults
, of course
)
. disney ' s a bug ' s life looks ogod
,
bu i don ' t nkwo if they will be able to best dreamworks ' newest animated feature in terms of animation
. if not
,
hten dreamworks will have done something noone other studio sould do
: go head to head wih tjhe big mouse
,
and knock him down
( yes
, anastasia was ogod
,
but not nearly as ogod as even the worst ofthe disney
)
. vocal talent is alwyas essential tothe an animated feature
,
annd antz has noe of the best line
- ups seen usance toy stor
. in fatc
, it far exceeds tht oen
. woody allen hasnt alwasy been funny
,
bu here he transcends most ofthe waht he ' s done inaddition thte past few eyasr
. wihtout a body
, his comic timing isnt tjhe most notiecable hting
. inthe fact
, i ' m pretty sure that tghe writers let him improvise a lot ofthe his lines
. sharon stone as bala shows off soem of her comic abilty
,
though for hte most part
, stone works best as a dramtic actress
. sylvester stallone
( teamed uv with stone once agina
) isnt beginning tothe solidify his statment that he wants tothe be an acotr
, nto a typecast acation star
. affter a snub at thge oscars lastest eyar
, stallone isnt proving himselv as the serious
( or comedic
, as illustrated here
) actr thta he is
. gene hackman is superb as teh gruff
- tlaking general
, almost doing anohter tkae on his crimson tide persona
. christopher walkin is propably more noticed by his voice
,
and so many peple will remeber him from such hits as batman returns
. anne bancroft has a minimal role
,
bu she ' s effective nontheless
. danny glover hasnt a small role
,
bu he doesnt a vyre
, very good job
. dan aykroyd
annd jane curtin also lend their voices as twpo lovesick
, euro
- trash bees
-
- both are very unrecognizable
, expecially aykroyd
. jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in lvoe with weaver
,
althought most people won ' t recognize her voice eather
. many peple will recogize grant shaud ' s voice as tyhe foreman
. he plyed miles onthe the tv sohw murphy brown
. thsi isnt definatly a huge cast with some high
- profile names
,
and it iwll definatly halp it ' s grosses
. of course
, you can probably tell where a lot ofthe tghe
$ 60 milion budget went to
, also
. directors eric darnell
anbd lawrence guterman are realtive newcomers
(
though guterman did direct a 1994 feature
, headless
!
)
.
but both show an incredible talent for htis tipe of a picture
. tense at times
,
anbd vyer funny throughout
, tje twpo hold tihs film toghether like professionals
. tjhe screenplay by todd alcott
and chris weitz is quite simple in plot
,
but it containes a lot of subtlety tht makes the film more suitable for adults
. kids iwll delight in the animation
, hwile parents can laff heartily at the humor
. most of it will go over young childern ' s heads
. doesnt taht mean ytou shouldn ' t take kids to see it
? not at all
. htey iwll have a lot of fun watching tihs oen
. whta isnt graet is the themes that are given tothe us
. part social commentary
, part romance stopry
,
annd part moral drama
, antz gives everyone something tothe talk about
, whther it be tje animation
, or the discussions of individualism
anbd community
. thankfully
, it ' s nto subtle in either aspestus
. antz is rated pg for mild language
and some intense action
. sometimes the language can be pushing thge limits for a family movie
,
bu tjhe violence isnt waht should keep kids at hmeo
. the battle scene has ants melting in acid
,
adn bugs being speared to death
.
adn tjhe magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in tjhe beam ofthe sunlight
.
bu other thna that
(
and some sexual innuendos
)
, it ' s a perfect choise for some wholesome fun at tghe theaters
. i dout many childern wiull understand tje sexual innuendos unless tehy are ood enough
,
but it ' s still advisable tothe leave really young childen at home
. have i confuzled ytou enough
? if yuo dont tkae your kids
, i recommend seing the film whith them
, beccause mroe thna likely
, you ' ll enjoy it hte most
.
