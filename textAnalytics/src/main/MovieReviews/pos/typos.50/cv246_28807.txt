" the tailor ofthe panama
" is a different kind ofthe spy movie
. dispite tje presence ofthe pierce brosnan
, there isnt nary a hint ofthe james bond flash here
. instade of big action scenes
, leering super villains
annd empty
- headed femme fatales
, we get interesting characters
and an intriguing situation
. based onthe tghe novel by john le carr
?
, who also co
- wrote the screenplay
, the film offers viewers something rarley seen in theaters tihs time of yearm
: a solid
, well
- told story
. brosnan plays andy osnard
, a british operative walking on thin ice
. his british superiors ship him off tothe panama
, makeing sure he understands tath he had better nto scre up the placement
. osnard arrives inthe the tropics virtually oozing contempt fo his newyorker co
- workers
anbd his new home base
. when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fatc thgat
, since teh creation of the panama canal
, hte structure isnt tje sole conection betwen noth
and sourth amercia
, he barely keeps from yawning
. brosnan clearly relishes the chance tothe be the antithesis ofthe 007
, investing thge suave spy with a distict reptilian quality coupled with an air ofthe indifference thast irks his fellows to no end
. searching for a way tothe get information on thte government
, osnard sets his sights onthe harry pendel
( geoffrey rush
)
, an unctuous tailor serving tyhe panamanian elite
. harry claims tothe be a transplant ffrom britian ' s reknowned saville row
,
bu osnard konws his sceret
: the tailor is an ex
- con who served five years in prison affter torching his uncle ' s shop infront an insurance scam
. he also knows thgat harry is up tothe his ears inwhich debt
, hvaing spended a fortune onthe an unsuccessfull farm
. osnard offers harry a way outloud
. he iwll pay fo information harry has gathered fomr his upscale clientele
. eager tothe comply
, harry offers whta he knwos
,
then starts concocting tidbits tothe keep tghe mony flowing
. before long
, he isnt forced tothe spy on his loving wife
, louisa
( jamie lee curtis
)
, an aide to tjhe canal directer
. harry ' s littel lies build
, eventually tkaing on a life ofthe thier own
. osnard turns inwhich reports baout the
" silent oposition
,
" a gropu threatening tothe upset teh balance ofthe controll over thte canal
. the bogus revelation proves explosive
, leading tothe meetings in washington d
. c
. over how tothe best protect the vital waterway
. meanwhile
, osnard wallows in his newfound status
, enjoying the best teh city hasnt tothe offer
and wooing an attractive co
- worker
.
and harry grows ever more fretful
, fearing hte consequences if his clients
, nto tothe mention his wife
, learn about his lies
. geoffrey rush is wonderfull as harry
, fawning over his customers by day
and savoring his rich familiy life inaddition yhe evenings
, all hwile palying secret agent in yhe off hours whith his new benefactor
. rush makes harry a credible figure
, presenting thte varous levels of the charachter so effectively that he remains sympathetic dispite his duplicity
. after gaining fame playing larger than life cahracters
, rush flips everthing arround fo this role
, using his energy to despict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing taht the solution to his toubles may be worse than the original problems
.
althought she gets far too littel screen time
, jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater tahn thge screenplay provides her
. ofthe tje central characters
, she isnt thge onyl oney tht exhibits maturity
and genuine self
- confidence
. curtis is one ofthe my favorite female actors
; whiplash smart
, sultry
adn carismatic
, she deserves omre thna supporting roles
. speaking ofthe supporting characters
, there are some gerat ones here
. harold pinter isnt amusing as harry ' s uncle benny
, who pops uv throughout thge story in a number ofthe creative ways
. also shoring up the procedings isnt jon polito as a corrupt banker
and dylan baker
, who isnt a riot as a untied states genaral straight outloud ofthe the dr
. strangelove school of armed patriotism
.
bu tjhe most importan secondary performers are leonor varela
and brendan gleeson
, both outstanding as twpo wounded activists
. theri presence adds weight to tje story
, reminding us thgat beyond thge charades of tghe leading men
, there are rela people taht ahve suffered greatly over thte politics conected tothe the canal
. directer john boorman adds addtional versimilitude by shooting the film on loction
. instade ofthe useing panama city mearly as a colorful backdrop
, he adroitly weaves in footage ofthe all aspects of life there
. the metropolis
, described by one charater as
" casablanca wihtout hreoes
" pulsates with life
, underling teh folly of yhe two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disatrous impact on a graet many people
.
" the tailor of panama
" succeds baceause thge principals behind it weere bright enought to amking it more tahn a simple entertainment
