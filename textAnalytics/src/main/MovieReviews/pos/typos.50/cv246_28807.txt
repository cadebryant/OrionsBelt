al
thought she gets far too little screen timne
, jamie lee curtis imbues louisa wih a depth greater than tjhe screenplay provides her
. of tje central charachters
, she isnt teh only noe thgat exhibits maturity adn genuine self
- confidence
. curtis isnt noe of my favorite female actors
; whiplash smart
, sultry annd charismatic
, she deserves more than supporting roles
. speaking of supporting charactors
, ther are some gerat ones here
. harold pinter is amusing as harry
' s uncle benny
, who pops uv
thoughout the stoyr in a number of creative ways
. also shoring uv yhe proceedings isnt jon polito as a corrupt banker adn dylan baker
, who isnt a riot as a united states general straight outloud of tghe dr
. strangelove school ofthe armed patriotism
. bu the most important secondary performers are leonor varela annd brendan gleeson
, both oust
anding as two wounded activists
. their presense adds weight to hte story
, reminding us that beyond the charades ofthe the leading men
, ther are rela peopel that have suffered greatly over yhe politics conected to the canal
. director john boorman adds addtional verisimilitude by shooting the film onthe location
. instade ofthe using panama city mearly as a colorful backdrop
, he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects ofthe life there
. the metropolis
, described by one charcter as
" casablanca wihtout heroes
" pulsates wiht life
, underling the folly of the twpo foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people
.
