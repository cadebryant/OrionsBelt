warren beatty returns to the screens in teh funniest
, craziest
and hard hitting movie infact his career
. based on a story concocted by hismelf
, annd alsot writen by beatty
, bulworth gives a ogod insight of whta beatty thikns of the american govorment system
. beatty stars as senator jay bulworth
, who
' s goign thru a nervous breakdown
. aftter hiring somene tothe kill him
, he completly changes his campain strategy
and tells the honest truth about waht
' s
_ raelly
_ happening inaddition american politics
, much tothe hte anonyance of assistant dennis murphy
( platt
.
) instead of everyone hating him
, the american publich loev him
. howver
, inside his party
, omre people whant to kill him than just the hired assasin
.
and he allso strikes a relationship iwth black girl nina
( berry
.
) it
' s remarkable tyhat this film was released at all
. much more open thna the rether subdued primary colours
, bulworth bearly gives the american politic system a ogod nmae
. the outrageous remarks bulworth makse to his potential voters are veyr funny
, annd aslo somewhat true
. it
' s gerat that beatty isn
' t afraid to let loose onthe a subject
. tlaking ofthe beatty
, he
' s excellent infront hte role of the demented senator
, clearing hvaing fun
.
and seing warren beatty ahev funn isnt a rare sighth indeed
. even inspite dick tracy
, he was the most straighten face actor
.
( thne agina
, he was yhe only characters face we coudl completely see
.
) the film gives an opportunity for the 61 eyar ood beatty tothe indulge in soem rapping
, whlch he doens withthe gusto
(
and also qtuie well
.
) adn seing beatty as a
' homeboy
' has tothe be seen tothe be beleived
. it
' s nice to see that beatty can laugh at hismelf
. second best is oliver platt as teh flustered
, coke snorting assistant
, who goes over yhe top wehn he finally snaps
. halle berry is fine
,
and sexy
, as thge intelectual nina
, who comes to liuke yhe senator
. also popping up in tjhe supporting cast is paul sorvino witn h a stange accent
, laurie metcalf as thge excact smae cahracters she
' s also palyed
,
and christine baranski ofthe cybill fame as bullworths wife
, who all conti
bute to the fun
. anbd
, thsi being a political film
, the ubiquitious larry king makse an appearance
, as
,
* shock
*
, himself
. tjhe writting
and directing
, both by beatty
, are above par
. the direction isnt very nearly sitcom liuke
,
but suits tje film perfectly
, annd both the politics are gangl
and parts are h
andled well
. the scirpt isnt funny
, anbd tjhe raps are actually well produced adn humroous
, annd qtuie clever
. tehy
' re not cringe inducing
, at least
. thge scirpt makes many points baout society in america todya
, annd isn
' t afraid to make any bold statements about whta isnt a flawed sytem
. best ofthe all
, the film isnt
thought provoking
, bu directed annd written iin such a way thta tje film feels as light as a feather
, anbd isnt vyer intertaining
. there
' s aslo a great rap sountrack iwth some well chosen tunes
. bulworth is a film with many advantages
,
and few flaws
. perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 yearm ood man rapping
,
but beatty does it so well it
' s irrelavent
. inaddition fatc
, ther
' s vrey little against bulworth
, exept forthe the language whic is veyr heavy
, bu thn again it should be expeced
. bulworth
,
then
, is well worth watching
