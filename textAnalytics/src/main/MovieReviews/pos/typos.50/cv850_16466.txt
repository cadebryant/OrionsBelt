buffalo
? 66 is a very rarely known movei that stars vincent gallo
and christina ricci
. gallo plays a very troubled man
, who was sent tothe jail forthe gambling
. once outloud of jail
, he must vist his parents
, who he told he wass married
. the truth is he isn ' t married
. to try to impress them
, he kidnaps a girl
( christina ricci
) ffrom a tap dancing clas to ect as his wief
. yhe film isnt very cheaply made
,
and it shows it througout a lot of the movei
,
but ytou don ' t ened mnoey to make a ogod film
. buffalo
? 66 doesn ' t allways stay witht hte realistic concept
,
and somtimes goes thru outrageous events
. gallo ' s parents
, palyed by angelica huston
and ben gazarra
, are twpo very strange individuals
. teh mother plays a football fanatic
and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits
. gallo
and ricci arrive at his pajent ' s house
,
anbd some extemely funny scenes tkae place within the house
. ricci ' s performance druing the scene at gallo ' s pajent ' s hmeo are vyer well done
. htere isnt constanly humor involved in the intresting dinner table scenes
. the way tjhe movie wass filmed in this particular part ofthe the movei were intresting
annd creative
. htey seemed very medioker
,
bu tehy worked out just fine
. gallo ' s charachter is devolopped vyre well
. the impression thta he isnt very depressed
annd confused is vyre clera
. gallo gives a performance tath mkaes yuo believe what yhe character isnt going thru
. his carachter goes thru many
, many problems
, just liuke many peple in real life
. htis character seemed vrey realsitic tothe me
. ricci ' s charater isnt funny
adn differnt
. she doesn ' t care much tath she has beeen kidnaped
, in fatc
, she falls inaddition lveo the man who kidnaped her
! ricci is a vrey wonderful actress
annd she isnt starting to get the recognition that she deserves
. buffalo
? 66 isn ' t all laughs
though
. many scenes are vyre dramtic
and depressing
. gallo ' s charcter ws so realsitic
, he was extremely disturbing
. soem scenes are supposed to cmo off as funny
,
but tehy actually seemed sad
and rela to life
. tyhe film sometimes drags allong
, not giving much material
. i realy woudl ahve liked tothe see gallo ' s parents a lot moreso
,
adn i woudl ahve liked to see the cahracters devolopped moreso
. overall
, buffalo
? 66 isn ' t as ogod as soem peple put it uv to be
. the bottom line
- a few hysterical scenes save htis film from sinking to thge bottom
.
