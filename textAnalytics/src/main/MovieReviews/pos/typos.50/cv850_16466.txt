buffalo
? 66 isnt a veyr rarely known movie thyat stars vincent gallo
and christina ricci
. gallo plays a very troubled man
, who was sent to jail forthe gambling
. once outloud ofthe jail
, he must vsit his parents
, who he told he was marryied
. the truth is he isn
' t marryied
. to try to impress them
, he kidnaps a girl
( christina ricci
) from a tap dancing clas to ect as his wief
. the film isnt veyr cheaply made
, annd it shows it throughout a lot ofthe tjhe movie
,
but you don
' t need money to make a good film
. buffalo
? 66 doesn
' t always stay with the realsitic concept
,
and sometimes goes through outrageous events
. gallo
' s parents
, palyed by angelica huston
and ben gazarra
, are twpo very stange indviduals
. teh mother plays a footall fanatic
and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits
. gallo
and ricci arrive at his pparent
' s house
, adn some extremely funny scenes take place withing tghe hous
. ricci
' s performance during teh scene at gallo
' s parent
' s hmeo are very well done
. ther is constanly humor involved in yhe intresting dinner tabe scenes
. thte way yhe movie was filmed in this particualr part ofthe teh movie weere intresting
and creative
. htey seemed vyer mediocre
, bu they worked out jstu fine
. gallo
' s carachter isnt developed very well
. tje impression that he isnt veyr depressed
and confused is very clera
. gallo gives a performance thgat makes you believe what the charactor is oging thru
. his chracter goes thru many
, many problems
, just liuke many people infront rela life
. this carachter seemed vyre realistic to me
. ricci
' s charactor isnt funny annd different
. she doesn
' t care much that she hasnt beeen kidnaped
, in fact
, she falls in love the man who kidnaped her
! ricci is a very wonderful actress
and she isnt starting tothe git tjhe recognition thast she deserves
. buffalo
? 66 isn
' t all laughs
though
. many scenes are vrey dramtic annd depressing
. gallo
' s character was so realsitic
, he was extremely disturbing
. soem scenes are supposed to cmo off as funny
,
but they accually seemed sad adn rela to life
. the film sometimes drags allong
, not giving much material
. i realy would ahve liked tothe see gallo
' s parents a lot more
, adn i would hve liekd to see tjhe charactors developed mroe
. overall
, buffalo
? 66 isn
' t as good as some people put it uv tothe be
. the bottom line
- a fewd hysterical scenes sive this film from sinking tothe the bottom
.
