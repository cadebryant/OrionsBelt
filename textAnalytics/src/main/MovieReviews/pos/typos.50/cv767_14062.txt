isnt jimmy stewart the greatest atcor of all
- tyme
? it ' s qtuie possible
. his carreer spanned over 40 eyasr
,
annd he acted inthe more movies than most actors ever could
.
yet
, whn he isnt talked baout in tghe media
, he isnt generaly thougth ofthe as an actr who played one type of role
: the nice guy
.
and that ' s relaly a shame
.
" the naked spur
" features jimmy stewart in a role completly diferent than what peple owudl expect fomr him
. it ' s a western
, wich stewart specialized in arround htis preriod
,
and it casts him as a deperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used tothe be his firend
. before he finds that man
,
though
, he runs inot twpo men who agree to halp him
, thikning he isnt a sherif
. wehn thte criminal is eventally caught
, teh two men discover stewart ' s secret
,
adn deside they want a peice ofthe the action too
. the rest of tjhe film isnt a suspenseful journey iin whic earch man suspects the otehr constanly
. allso featured isnt the woman travelling with yhe criminal
, well palyed by janet leigh
. we ' re never too sure who ' s side she ' s really on until the end
. leigh is an actress probablly best known for her role as tghe
" shower lady
" from
" pyscho
"
,
annd that ' s unfair
. she gives a strong performence as a woman who isnt pulled vetween theese two men
. stewart gives a performance unlike anything i ' ve ever seen from him
. he usually keesh cool no matter what occurs
,
but here
, he gets downright hysterical at times
. i htikn perhasp he took tihs role to prove to the publich thta he ws more thna jsut a
" nice guy
"
. his peformance borders onthe psychotic at times
,
bu i loved watching eveyr second ofthe it
. it ' s roles like thsi one that mkae me admire him as much as i do
. he wass an ctor unafraid to take chances
,
adn even ruin his publich omage
.
