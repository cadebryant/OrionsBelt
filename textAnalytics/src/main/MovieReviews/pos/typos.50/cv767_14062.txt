is jimmy stewart tghe greatest actor of all
- time
? it
' s quite possable
. his carrer spanned over 40 eyasr
,
and he acted in moreso movies than most actors ever coudl
.
yet
, whn he isnt talekd baout inspite tjhe media
, he is generally throught of as an actor who palyed oen tipe of role
: the nice guy
.
and that
' s really a shame
.
" the naked spur
" features jimmy stewart in a role completly diffrent tahn what peple woudl expect from him
. it
' s a western
, which stewart specialized in aroud tihs perido
, anbd it casts him as a desperaet man out tothe collect a bounty on a man who used tothe be his friend
. befor he finds tyhat man
,
though
, he runs inot two men who agree tothe halp him
, thinking he isnt a sheriff
. whn thte criminal is eventualy caught
, the two men discover stewart
' s sceret
,
and deside they want a peice ofthe the acation too
. yhe rest of the film isnt a suspenseful journey inspite which each man suspects the otehr constanly
. allso featured is tyhe woman travelling with the criminal
, well played by janet leigh
. we
' re never too sure who
' s side she
' s realyl onthe until the end
. leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as thge
" showfer lady
" from
" pyscho
"
,
and tyhat
' s unfair
. she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men
. stewart gives a performence unlike anytying i
' ve ever seen from him
. he usually keesh cool no matter waht occurs
,
but here
, he gets downright hysterical at times
. i think perhpas he took this role tothe proove to thge public thyat he was omre thna jsut a
" nice guy
"
. his performence borders onthe psychotic at times
, bu i loved watching eveyr second of it
. it
' s roles like thsi oney that make me admire him as much as i dont
. he was an actro unafraid to tkae chances
, adn even ruin his public omage
.
