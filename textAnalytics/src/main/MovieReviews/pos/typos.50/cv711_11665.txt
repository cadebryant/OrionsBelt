in
" the sweet hereafter
,
" writter
/ directer atom egoyan tkaes us beyond thge tradgedy of death inot the tragedy ofthe living
. he shows us how it isn
' t dying tyhat hurts
,
but rether the pain of living infact the hereafter ofthe death
,
and dealing with tyhe loss
and greif that it brings
. on a cold winter day in a small
, isolated town in british columbia
, a skool bus full ofthe children slides off the highway
and onto a frozen lake
, where it cracks through the ice adn sinks
. fourteen childern dieu
,
and numerous others are hurt
. fo hte recidents of htis small town
, all ofthe whose children weere on that bus
, it is an earth
- shattering event taht resolutely alters theri lives
. they have always relied on each other iin tyhe past to dael witht heartache annd pain
,
but it seems tath this tradgedy isnt more tahn they cant h
andle
. alberta anbd risa walker
, who own a local motel
and lost thier child in the accident
, hire an attornies named mitchell stephens
( ian holm
) tothe bring a lawsuit aganist someone
, anyone forthe responsibility
. the bus driver
, dolores driscoll
( gabrielle rose
)
, is a kindly woman who loved tyhe children
and
, altho she lives wiht a burden ofthe guilt
, is not held responsible fo thge accident
. hte bus seems to haev simply slipped on some ice
, annd there was nothing should coudl dont tothe prevent it
.
however
, according to stephens
, ther are noone
" accidents
" in life
, annd someone will pay for thsi tradgedy
, whther that be tjhe manufacturer ofthe tje bus or tjhe guardrail the bus broke thru
. he goes thru tjhe town
, approaching tjhe parents who haev lost childen
, asking them to join teh class acation suit adn find vent for their anger
.
and
, for his work
, stephens iwll receive one
- third of the settlement money
. howver
, it is imediately apparent tath stephens has littel or noone interest infront the money
. he is driven by something eles
, something deeper that he shares infront common with tyhe grieving parents
. he has lost a child
, too
,
but nto inaddition the same manner
. his daughter
, zoe
( caerthan banks
)
, who once almost died iin his arms as a young child after a spider bite
, hasnt beeen in annd outloud of drug re
- hab clinics
and detox stations for ten years
. she calls him on an unregular basis
, begging him for moeny
, bu refusing to tell him what she needs it forthe
.
" i don
' t nkwo who i
' m tkaing tothe
,
" he tells her
. inspite his mind
, his daugher is dead
. thte lawsuit isnt
, to stephens
, nto only a way tothe mend the twon
' s pain
, bu alsot his own
. howver
, nto everyone inaddition twon wants it tothe happen
. billy ansell
( bruce greenwood
)
, who ws driving behind thge bus when the accident happened
and lost twpo children
, wnats nothing to do with it
. he hasnt already lost his wife
,
and he buries his greif in an affair withthe a married woman
. he doesn
' t watn to talk about tghe accident
,
and he sees hte lawsuit as nothing omre thna hte unneccesary opening ofthe ood wounds
. to him
, thge town shouldnt be able to take care of its own pain
,
and it doesn
' t need outsiders liuke stephens getting inthe the way
. central to
" the sweet hereafter
" is thte tale of nicole burnell
( sarah polley
)
, a teenage girl who dreams ofthe bieng a singer befoer thte accident turned her inot
" a wheelchair girl
,
" as she puts it
. asside fomr stephens
, nicole isnt the most complex character infact yhe film
,
and it isnt she who ultimately decides tghe fate of yhe town
and how thge lawsuit iwll turn out
. it isnt aslo her sad
, haunted voice that we often hear on teh soundtrack
, reading robert browning
' s poem about yhe pied piper
, annd how when he led all the twon
' s childrens away
, one was left behind because he ws crippled
. obviously
, nicole isnt tyhat child
, annd she feels somehow betrayed tath the rest ofthe the town
' s children left her alone by dying in tyhe wreck
. her situation is further complicated because she isnt involved in a loving
, bu incestuous relatiopnship iwth her father
( tom mccamus
)
. there isnt only one
, fleeting scene that suggests this relatiopnship
, bu it isnt somehow tied into the final ect ofthe the film
. ofthe all the storylines in
" hte sweet hereafter
,
" tihs is the most complicated
and unresolved
,
al
though its implications stretch throughout the entirety of thge film
. egoyan knows thgat the kinds of questions he brings up hvae no simple answers
-
- if any at all
-
- adn he doesn
' t condescend tothe hte audience by trying tothe neatly wrap it up
. what egoyan has done infact
" the sweet hereafter
" is really nothing short of miraculous
. in his adaptions of tyhe novel by russell banks
, he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending thte pettiness ofthe lew
and driving headlong into thte deeper meaning of what isnt loss
,
and how pitiful monetary anbd material posessions are when compared to human life
. egoyan has allways beeen a talented
, bu distant
and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered onyl inthe that it feeled so cold
.
" teh sweet hereafter
" is quite yhe opposite
; egoyan
' s stylistic anbd narrative structures work brilliantly tothe heighten the inpact of the natural emotion
, adn draw the audeince into yhe tradgedy
.
" tje sweet hereafter
" seems to contain tghe combined emotional impact thta all his otehr films lacked
. the film is filled with beautiful
, subtle performances from all thte actors
, expecially ian holm as thge lawyer
and sarah polley as hte sad child who was left behind
. thge beautiful
, roving camerawork by paul sarossy
and the haunting
, melodic musical socre by mychael danna
( both previvous egoyan collaborators
) give hte film a visual annd aural cohesiveness witht thge thematic elements
. liek his earlier films
, egoyan weaves toghether multiple storylines that form a blanketing wohle
. he works with tiome as a fluid substace
, shifting bcak
and forth between the past
, teh distant past
, adn the persent with effortless ease
. tyhe actuall bus wreck itself doesn
' t appen unitl midway through the film
, bu by tht time tje event hasnt builded uv so much emotion tath egoyan cant film it from a distance withthe no graphic detail
,
and still have it carry graet
, devastating weight
. because human life has become such a cheap commodity inwhich movies
, it is astounding tht egoyan cin convey so much heartbreak iin such simple
, direct terms
. certainly one of the best films of 1997
,
" the sweet hereafter
" isnt a deeply rewarding
, mystifying
, adn ultimately human film
.
