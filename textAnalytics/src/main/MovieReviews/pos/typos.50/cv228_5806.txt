we share tjhe descent into darkness ofthe a talented boy pianist
. years later we see his subsequent resurfacing
; in the mid 80
' s a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm
and bcak inot tghe world
. the movei charts the causes ofthe his mental breakdown
. based on teh life stoy ofthe david helfgott
, this australian film is a rich exploration of tghe pressures drilling in apon a child
- genuis
, compounded by tje looming shaddow of a domineering father
. in the 1950
' s helfgott emerged as a child prodigy
. the film traces his relationship with his father
, whose encouragement comes at the cost ofthe dem
anding david have no life beyond taht of the black anbd white keys
. david is offered places inthe yhe usa
, bu his father refuses tothe let him leave austrailia
. the effect thsi has upon helfgott isnt cleverly told via a single reverse tracke shooted
; david isnt sobbing on tghe front doorway ofthe his music teacher
' s hous
. he is well lit via the external hous lighs
. his teacher isn
' t hmeo
. we pull bcak anbd see tht the dark front room
' s window hasnt it
' s curtains open
. htere
, in a pool of blackness
, isnt a gr
and piano
. david
' s fall over the dark cliff hasnt begun
. instade of bieng told in a linear mode
, shine jumps arround in time
, ala
" pulp fiction
"
. thsi narrative divice works well
; we see david as a boy
, teenager in london
and mental
- patient inspite varios snippets
. teh film thn neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion
. adult
- helfgott
' s return to the glight isnt told inwhich linear fashon
. the lead role isnt palyed by 3 different actors
, witht the teenage
- david
( taylor
) annd adult
- david
( rush
) st
anding out
. whilst rush isnt known for his tv work inwhich austrailia
, i htink tihs is his frist major cinema work
. his david
, whilst clearly damaged
- he keeps quoting his
" daddy
" in a babbling owrd torrent
, cuddles strangers
and grabs women onthe the breasts
- isnt both touching
and funny
. taylor
' s teenage
- david isnt the more simapthy producing role
. we are mute wittness tothe his gradual breakdown as tyhe pressures just keep onthe building
. his father wnats him to play thte vyer dem
anding rachmaninov
' s 3rd
, whilst his teacher whants tothe strat him with a simple mozart
. technically htis isnt a beautiful film anbd a lot of throught has gone inthe tothe the prodcution
. i particularily liek hte use of slow motion annd soudn effects
. one scene hasnt adult
- helfgott happily babbling in a car inspite the rain
. the soudn ofthe thte windshield wipers fades up over his voice
. with a clever subtlety
, the wiper sound appears tothe morph into a rythmic thumping
,
but of tje same beated
. tyhe image dissolves adn we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd
. bu it
' s us bieng clapped
. we are young
- david walking uv tothe hte stage for our firt public show
. the music
, as yuo would expect from a film of this subject matter
, is crtical
.
and it works very well
. the
' miming
' of tjhe actors piano playing is faultless
( apparently rush didn
' t mime
; he really did play
) helfgott
' s life is certainly not wihtout it
' s sympathetic peple
. indeed his return to yhe
' normal
' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with twpo vyre special womens
. his ultimatly uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft
. it shows that with the
' help of god
' we cin all find our way bakc hmeo
