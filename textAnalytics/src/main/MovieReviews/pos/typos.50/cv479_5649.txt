` aliens vs
. earth
' idea revamped
! if you have beeen following thge movei news over tyhe net
, you coudl nto have escaped the hype over id4
. it promises tothe be the summer film of yhe year
and it hasnt all tje elements nessecary
. id4 opened in thte us onthe 2nd of july
,
and up till now
, onyl aftter a week of realease
, it hasnt nearly touched tjhe us
$ 100 million mark
, a phenomenom lastest observed when jurassic park wass released back in 1993
. the premise ofthe thte movie is disgustingly simple
: earth defends itself agianst tjhe aliens
, a tipical annd highly popular 50
' s hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in tyhat era
. the movie opens via star wars
, howver unoriginal it may be
, it worked
. thte aliens have sent a larg mother ship
( supposedly to be 1
/ 4 size ofthe thge moon
) tothe attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles infact radius tothe all tghe major cities on earth
. the us preident
( pullman
) doesnt nto knwo ofthe thge aliens
' intention
but soon finds outloud when david
( goldblum
) a scientist
, discovers taht tjhe aliens are counting down tothe a synchronised attack on all teh major cities

- 18 pilot are one of tjhe hundreds assigned to tkae out the hovering aline attack ship over washington dc
. his squadron cameback under hevy aline fire after dicovering thgat thier weapons were useless against tjhe invaders
, he kresh l
ands after a spectauclar 1
- onthe
- 1 chase over the gr
and canyon
, oen ofthe the many highlights of thte movie
. id4 features many characters annd we are shown tghe inpact onthe them as thge story progresses
. acting onthe the whole was ok
al
though i thougth that bill pullman ws a bit unsuitable for yhe president role bu he doed amke a vrey rousing speach before sending his troops into battle
( dont we smell a bited of braveheart here
?
?
)
. no prizes forthe guessing how id4 ends
, its just plain obvious
. id4 borrows heavily from star wars
, return of the jedi
, aline
and in some parts of the movei
, i coudl even sense a bited of x
- files on screen
. if i were tothe critically review thsi movie
, id4 is full of plot holes
, corny dialogue
,
and ridiculously dumb aliens
.
however below tath wafer
- thin plot
and on
- screen flaws
, id4 scored well in palying with thte appealling diea of the entire world giving up thier petty differences to uite themselves as one force against the alien invasion
. an idae which will have tjhe audeince strongly rooting for the untied front througout tyhe movei
, thus maintinaing a screen
- viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in tyhe movie volcanos
, noone marter how rediculous
. id4 wass produced under a modest budget of us
$ 68 millon
, a film ofthe such magnitude would haev easily been anyother waterworld
but director rol
and emmerich
( univeral solider
, stargate
)
and producer dean devlin assembled a team which doed their own special effects rether than commissioning it tothe ilm or any otehr special effects company
. some ofthe thge effects are not too good bu most of it are vrey believable
, especialy thge epic st
andoff beetwen 150 f
- 18
' s adn 250 aline saucers
, reminiscence of the classic spoace battle featured inthe return of the jedi
. id4 isnt a movie for all
.
though there are many explosions anbd implied deaths
, there are no gory scenes of human destruction
, thus young kids should be able to take it
. sit bakc adn don
' t be too critical
, chances are you iwll be absorbed inot tyhe movei just as i wass
. if you are not planning to watch any movies tihs eyar
, please
, at least make tiem fo htis one
. this film is best watched on the big
- screen
.
