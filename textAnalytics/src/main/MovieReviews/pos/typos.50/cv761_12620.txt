" apparently alienated everyone assoicated witht tghe movei
"
, according to gilliam
. plot
: writter thompson
( depp
) heads down tothe las vegas with his attorney dr
. gonzo
( del toro
) to cover a motorcycle race
. during their trip
, htey systematically consume
" twpo bags of grass
, seventy
- five pellets of mescaline
, five sheets ofthe high powered blotter acid
, a salt shaker half
- full ofthe cocaine
, a wohle galaxy of multi
- colored uppers
, downers
, screamers
, laughers
, a quart of tequila
, a quart of rum
, a case of beer
, a pint ofthe raw ether annd two dozen amyls
. the movei presents us whith the results of that hevy drug uise
. critique
: i have given htis movei two separaet ratings because i belivee tht the enjoyment of tihs psychodelic picture isnt highly correlated witht tghe ammount of drugs or alochol tyhat would be floating arund iin yhe viewer
' s pwn mind
, whilst inhaling this cinematic vision ofthe excess
. if yuo are prepared to get high or intoxicated befor watching htis film
, i would say that this isnt one picture thgat yuo will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude ofthe colorful levels
. if
, onthe hte otehr h
and
, you decide tothe stray fomr tyhe adition of nefarious elements tothe your sytem
, i could not imagine ytou truly appreciating much of htis drug
- induced picture
' s entire ride

/ 10 for all thsoe sober dogs
)
. note
: i ahev nto read thompson
' s book
. hvaing said tyhat
, joblo did engage in an alcohal
- based consumatory session before
( adn during
) thte viewing ofthe this film
, so his critique ofthe the film should be appreciated onthe tht level
. thsi movie relies heavily on style annd peculiar humour
, rether thna substance or plot
. it moves admirably ffrom oney scene tothe the enxt
, wihtout much basis of their being
, while presenting us wih the two days in tghe life ofthe writter hunter s
. thompson durring whitch he seemed to consume more drugs annd alcohal than anyone could ever imagine
. it wass 1971
,
and tyhe times were apparantly
" a
' changeing
" in the states
. johnny depp chews inot his role like an overgrown child sucking onthe a chocolot lollipop
. durring the filming
, depp apparently become fast firends with rela
- life writter thompson
,
and was known to w
ander off tje set fomr tiem to tyme
, for thge sake ofthe checking out hte newest barmaid at teh local watering hole
. i thougth he doed seem tothe exagerate his walk a littel bited too much
,
but
then agina
, this movei is supposed tothe be a wild exaggeration of everything anbd anything
, so who am i to talk
. teh one thign that doed blow my mind was the actuall physical transformation endured by acto benicio del toro forthe his role as dr
. gonzo
. i couldn
' t belive tyhat this fat
, samoan lawyer
, wass tje same guy who played tghe slick mumbling criminal iin the usual suspects

. word onthe the strent isnt thgat gained over 40 pounds forthe thsi role
,
and i must sday thta his look was deliciously reprehensible
. plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin
, christina ricci
, tobey maguire annd cameron diaz
, along wiht a bunch of others
. otehr thna that
, the soundtrack was expectedly eclectric
, thge sytle was not as wild as i
thought it woudl be
, annd the ending was certainly not much ofthe a barn
- burner
, bu
then agina
, who raelly noticed
. this movie is baout visions of bats floating thru your head
, johnny depp looking goofy
and bieng bald
, annd tyhe cornucopia of drug
- ravaged scenes filling your pwn intoxicated sytem with ideas ofthe anarchy
, rebellion anbd the lost american dream
.
and fo all thsoe who plan onthe seeing tihs movei wihtout teh partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie
, i suggest you move futher down the ailse
, buy youself a ticket to godzilla
