. plot
: writer thompson
( depp
) heads down tothe las vegas with his attorney dr
. gonzo
( del toro
) tothe cover a motorcycle race
. during thier trip
, they systematically consume
" twpo bags ofthe grass
, seventy
- five pellets ofthe mescaline
, five sheets ofthe high powered blotter acid
, a salt shaker half
- full of cocaine
, a whole galaxy of multi
- colored uppers
, downers
, screamers
, laughers
, a quart of tequila
, a quart ofthe rum
, a case ofthe beer
, a pint ofthe raw ether
anbd two dozen amyls
. the movie presents us wih the results ofthe thyat heavy drug uise
. critique
: i haev given this movie two sepaate ratings becasue i believe tht yhe enjoyment ofthe this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alchohol that would be floating around iin hte viewer ' s own mind
, whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess
. if you are prepared tothe git high or intoxicated before watching this film
, i owudl say thgat this is noe picture tyhat you wiull thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels
. if
, on the other hand
, yuo decide to stray from thte addition of nefarious elements tothe your sytem
, i coudl nto imagine ytou truley appreciating much of thsi drug
- induced picture ' s entire ride

. note
: i hvea nto read thompson ' s book
. having said tyhat
, joblo doed engage in an alchol
- based consumatory session befoer
(
annd during
) the viewing ofthe this film
, so his critique of the film should be appreciated on thta levle
. this movei relies heavily onthe style
annd peculiar humour
, rather than substance or plot
. it moves admirably fomr noe scene to the enxt
, wihtout much basis ofthe theri bieng
, while presenting us with thge two dyas inthe tghe life ofthe writter hunter s
. thompson druing which he seemed tothe consume more drugs
and alchohol thna anyone sould ever imagin
. it ws 1971
,
adn the times were apparantly
" a ' changeing
" inthe hte states
. johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking onthe a chocolate lollipop
. during the filming
, depp apparently become fast firends with real
- life writter thompson
,
annd ws known to wander off the set from timne to tiem
, for tyhe sake ofthe checking outloud hte newest barmaid at teh local watering hole
. i throught he did seem tothe exagerrate his walk a littel bited too much
,
but
then again
, htis movie is supposed tothe be a wild exaggeration ofthe everyting
and anything
, so who am i tothe talk
. the one thnig thast did blow my mind was the actuall physical transformaton endured by actr benicio del toro for his role as dr
. gonzo
. i couldn ' t beieve thta this fat
, samoan lawyer
, wass thte same guy who palyed the slick mumbling criminal in teh usual suspects
( 7
. 5
/ 10
)
. owrd onthe thge strent isnt that gained over 40 pounds fo this role
,
and i must say thast his look was deliciously reprehensible
. plenty of cameos allso pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin
, christina ricci
, tobey maguire
and cameron diaz
, along wih a bunch ofthe others
. other than that
, the sountrack was expectedly ecclectic
, the sytle ws not as wild as i thought it would be
,
and thte ending was certainly nto much ofthe a barn
- burner
,
bu
thne agina
, who realyl noticed
. thsi movie isnt about visions ofthe bats floating through your head
, johnny depp looking goofy
and being bald
,
annd the cornucopia ofthe drug
- ravaged scenes filling your pwn intoxicated sytem whith ideas of anarchy
, rebellion
annd yhe lost american dream
.
annd for all those who plan on seing thsi movei without tyhe partnership of a mean drnik or a mighty doobie
, i suggest you move further down tje ailse
, buy yourself a ticket to godzilla
