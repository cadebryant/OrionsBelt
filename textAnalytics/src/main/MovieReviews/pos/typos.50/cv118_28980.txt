plot
: a human space astronaut accidentally falls apon a planet ruled by apes
. he is taken prisoner along with soem otehr humans
,
and tries his best tothe excape his simian captors
. oh yeah
,
and doed i mention thast teh apes cant talk
? kewl
! critique
: despite this film nto looking like a
" tim burton movie
" or its lead human character showing any signs of bieng a human bieng hismelf
, i doed fidn myself generaly entertained throughout most of htis film
and dont reccommend it as fun
, summer fare
.
al
though thge thign that sets this movei apart ffrom all others is definatly its incredable ape amke
- up jobs annd characterizations
. i mean
, i was completly conviced thast every single one of theese apes ws for real
! i aslo ahve to
" give it up
" to all ofthe the actors inside the costumes
, nto onyl for waking up at threee in yhe morning every day to git amking
- uv slobbered all over them for 2
- 4 hours
, bu for comming through their costumed exteriors
and selling us thier characters onthe the screen as well
. i especialy enjoied bonham carter
' s performance
, who i beleived to be tje most devolopped character infact tjhe entire film
( human or ape
) adn tim roth
' s bad guy
, who chewed uv scenery annd oozed evil infact every scene infront which he took part
. plot
- wise
, i liekd hte beginnig of tje film
, thte wohle build
- uv once wahlberg got into yhe vilage
, hte excape
and most of thge fight scenes
,
but once things got out into the deserted areal
(
and teh final battle sequence
)
, i kinda lost a bited of my intrest
. i ws much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters
and hte whole idea of
" human beings as animals
"
then i ws baout the end battle sequence
, which just seemed a bit too typical forthe this kind ofthe film
. i also hated the
" kid
" charactor who jsut got on my nerves anbd didn
' t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved
( i won
' t ruin it here bu c
' mon guys
.
.
. you coulda throught of something a littel mroe plausible thna thyat
, noone
?
)
.
but tjhe hting that held this movei back more than anything alse ws its lead character
, his cold demenor
and tje zero chemestry tyhat he shared with either noe ofthe his inter
- speices loev interests
. this dued didn
' t seem tothe give a rat
' s ass about anyone
but himself adn i ultimatly didn
' t really care about wqat happend tothe him either
. nowe i
' m not sure if htis wass yhe fault ofthe the actor or hte scirpt
,
but the film suffered baceause ofthe it
. visually
, the movie wass allso nice to look at
( especially the apes
!
)
, bu i definately expeced greater coolness from tim burton
. the
" surprise ending
" tht highlighted hte original planet of teh apes film back inwhich 1968
, felt a littel tacked on here
, anbd despite bieng interesting
, didn
' t realyl make all that much sense to me
( unless ytou look at it from a sequal point of view
)
. so overall
, i loved thte wohle
" feel
" ofthe the planet
, the apes tath ruled it
, thge manner inaddition whic tehy treated the humans
, screamed
, shouted
and reverted yhe entire evolution chain
, bu didn
' t appretiate the film
' s lack ofthe human charactor develpment
( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie
?
) adn the fatc that its lead male
and female humans weere jsut plain boring
.
but i would still recomend this film as a fun
, summer movei with laughs
, creepiness anbd a really kool premise
. ps
: for anyone who has seen the orginal
, i cannnot beleive that they didn
' t at least bring back the scene inaddition whitch tyhe lead human charachter
( inspite htis case
, mark wahlberg
) goes nuts at the world in whlch he
' s suddenly been thrust
(
" this is a mad hous
!
"
- tipe ofthe thing
)
. the guy inaddition this film bearly seems tothe be
" put off
" by the fatc that he
' s surrounded by apes who can speak english
!
