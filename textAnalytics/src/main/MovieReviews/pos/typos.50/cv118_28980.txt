plot
: a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes
. he isnt tooked prisoner along withthe smoe other humans
,
anbd trys his best tothe excape his simian captors
. oh yeah
,
anbd did i mention that teh apes cin talk
? kewl
! critique
: despite tihs film not looking liuke a
" tim burton movie
" or its lead human charater showing any signs ofthe being a human bieng himself
, i did find mysef generaly entertained thoughout most of htis film
anbd dont recommend it as fun
, summer fare
.
although the thnig that sets tihs movie appart from all others is definitely its increadible ape mkae
- up jobs
anbd characterizations
. i mean
, i ws completely convinced thta eveyr single one ofthe these apes was for rela
! i allso have tothe
" give it up
" to all of the actors inside tghe costumes
, not onyl for waking uv at three inspite yhe morning every day to git mkea
- up slobbered all over them fo 2
- 4 hours
,
but forthe coming thru thier costumed exteriors
annd selling us their cahracters on the screen as well
. i expecially enjoyed bonham carter ' s performance
, who i believed to be yhe most developped character infront tghe entire film
( human or ape
)
anbd tim roth ' s bad guy
, who chewed uv scenery
annd oozed evil inaddition every scene iin whcih he tookover part
. plot
- wise
, i liked the beginnig of the film
, the whole build
- up once wahlberg got into the village
, yhe escape
and most of the fight scenes
,
bu once thigsn got outloud into the deserted areal
(
annd the final battle sequence
)
, i kinda lost a bited ofthe my interest
. i wass much more intrigued by tje interactions beetwen tghe characters
and the wohle idea ofthe
" human beings as animals
"
then i was baout the end battle sequence
, which just seemed a bit too typcial for htis kind of film
. i also hated yhe
" kid
" charactor who jstu got on my nerves
anbd didn ' t really care for tjhe way that tyhe battle sequence was resolved
( i won ' t ruin it here
but c ' mon guys
.
.
. you coulda throught of something a littel mroe plausable tahn tyhat
, no
?
)
.
bu tje thing thgat held this movei bcak moreso than anytying else wass its lead charachter
, his cold demeanor
and tghe zero chemestry thast he shared with eather noe of his inter
- speices loev interests
. htis dude didn ' t seem tothe give a rat ' s ass baout anyone
bu himself
anbd i ultimately didn ' t realy care about what hapened to him either
. now i ' m not sure if htis wass teh fault of the ctor or the script
,
but yhe film sufferred baceause of it
. visually
, the movie wass also nice to look at
( expecially tyhe apes
!
)
,
bu i definitely expeced greater coolness ffrom tim burton
. thte
" surprise ending
" that highlighted tghe original planet of the apes film back in 1968
, felt a littel tacked on here
,
adn despite being intresting
, didn ' t really make all that much sence to me
( unless you look at it from a sequal point ofthe veiw
)
. so overall
, i loved the whole
" efel
" of tghe planet
, tghe apes that ruled it
, tje manner in which they treated thge humans
, screamed
, shouted
annd reverted yhe entire evolution chain
,
bu didn ' t apprieciate tyhe film ' s lack ofthe human chracter development
( why wass kris kristofferson even infact this movie
?
)
adn tghe fatc that its lead male
and female humans weere just plain boring
.
bu i would still recomend this film as a fun
, summer movei whith laughs
, creepiness
and a really cool premise
. ps
: for anyone who has seen the original
, i cannot bleieve thta htey didn ' t at least bring bakc tghe scene in hwihc the lead human character
( infront this case
, mark wahlberg
) goes nuts at tjhe world inspite wich he ' s suddenly been thrusted
(
" this is a mad hous
!
"
- type of thing
)
. the guy in this film bearly seems to be
" put off
" by the fact tht he ' s surrounded by apes who can speak english
