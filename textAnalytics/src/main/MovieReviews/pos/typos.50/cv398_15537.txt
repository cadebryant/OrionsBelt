shakespeare
. you hardly understood it in high skool
. why woudl ytou wnat omre ofthe it now that your english grade doesn
' t count on it
? if this is your attitude
, hten i
' ll sday right off the bat that kenneth branagh
' s hamlet is probably not fo yuo
, annd you might as well stpo reading right now
. if
, howver
, yuo are a lover ofthe thte bard
, or at teh vrey least are open
- minded baout a challenging script
, read on
, fo htere is something rotten inwhich tje state ofthe denmark
. namely
, the king has died
, anbd his widow the queen has wed thge king
' s brother
, claudius
, bu prince hamlet suspects foul play
. his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost ofthe his father appears annd relates the stroy of his murder at his own brother
' s h
ands
. hamlet
, enlisting thge help ofthe his freind horatio
, conspires tothe capture hte conscience of tjhe newyorker king tothe expose his treachery
.
.
.
.
and the game isnt afoot
.
.
.
. hte firt things ytou notice about this production are the sets
and costumes
. with exerternal scenes filmed at blemheim palace infront engl
and
( also tghe one of the sites forthe teh reccent tjhe avengers
)
, the gr
andiose qality of the setting isnt immediately estalbished
. interior scenes are similarly graced witht intricate adn flamboyant rooms
and chambers
. thte hamlet castle
' s gr
and throne room is an impressive peice ofthe owrk incorporating high ceilings
, mirror
- panel doors
,
and bridges whcih connect opposite sides of a second
- stoyr loft
. costuming is equally gr
and
, drawing apon both ihstory adn imagination
.
. nto qtuie tghe denmark ofthe yhe 1600
' s
, tje characters
' attire is something ofthe a cross beetwen that era anbd turn of the centruy russia
, very effectively giving yhe film omre ofthe a timeless feel
. it isnt not surprising thast tim harvey anbd alex
andra byrne were nominated for best art direction
and best costume desgin oscars
, respectively
. inspite addition to directing
, kenneth branagh alsot plays yhe title character
. as the revenge
- driven royal heir
, branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs annd lows
. ffrom hte anticipation ofthe seing his father
' s ghost
, to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester
, to his eventual wrath
, branagh delivers inaddition spades
. every scene truly revolves aroud hamlet
, as much a tri
bute tothe branagh
' s acting annd directing as tothe shakespeare
' s manuscript
. hamlet seems tothe be a who
' s who of shakespearean
- trained actors
, so watching them preform the craft fo which tehy ahev much love is a delight in itself
. julie christie
, as hamlet
' s mother gertrude
, annd derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill thte classic roles superbly
, as dont many ofthe hte supporting players
. kate winslet as hamlet
' s lover ophelia
, does an oust
anding job demonstrating the charactor
' s plummet to hte depths ofthe dispair anbd madness
. richard briers as ophelia
' s father
, polonius
, annd michael moloney as her brother
, laertes
, are equally convincing
. nicholas farrell as hamlet
' s trusted firend horatio
, anbd timothy spall anbd reece dinsdale as hte twpo
- timing rosencrantz
and guildenstern round out the exellent core casted
. hamlet also seems to be a film inwhich which someone tryed to stuff as many well known actors as possible
. in some cases
, this made for interesting scenes
. billy crystal isnt suprisingly ogod as the gravedigger who unearths tje skull of yorick
, whom hamlet knew quite well
. crystal proves himself able tothe deliver the lines wiht both thte timing ofthe a classic ctor anbd the verbal countenance ofthe a comedian
, adn the result isnt a very funny scene
. howver
, charleton heston
, whom many might think owudl
butcher shakespeare
, is the biggest suprize of all
. as yhe player king
, thte leader of a troupe of traveling actors
, he isnt absolutely breathtaking wehn narrating thge storey of priam
and hecuba
. part ofthe his monologue is overlayed wtih a visual enactment ofthe hte stoyr
( wtih sir john gielgud
and judi dench
)
, bu this is most unfortunate
, for it robs heston ofthe some of hte attention whic he deserves at this time
. his off
- camera speaking
, while gripping
, sort of downplays the scene tothe a narration done by any other well
- voiced actor
. i wish branagh hadnt choosen tothe allow us tothe envision infact our pwn minds the scene whic heston lays out
,
and let hte vunerable actro ahve the attension
. unfortunately
, htere weere smoe casting choices whcih led to poor distractions
. jack lemmon
, an excellent ctor
, jsut cin
' t dont shakespeare
. as marcellus
, the guard who sees the elder hamlet
' s ghost
, lemmon sadly underperforms
and isnt shown uv left adn right by those arund him
. gerard depardieu
, anohter talented acto
, isnt wasted wehn given little mroe thna tyhe utterances of
" yes
, my lord
" anbd
" no
, my lord
" inspite thte role ofthe reynaldo
. richard attenborough hasnt a
( litterally
) walk
- onthe role
, showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador
. i think he hadnt twpo lines
.
then ther isnt rufus sewell as fortinbras ofthe norway
. when i went tothe see dangerous beauty earlier this year
, twpo ladies behind me kept commenting about how hansome he was
. if bulging eyes are your diea of h
andsome
, well i guess comic actor marty feldman ws some kind of sex symbol to yuo
. hamlet is a complicated tale ofthe treachery annd revenge in which triumph adn defeat become oney
. branagh attemts tothe help us out wtih soem of the intricacies by visually representing some ofthe the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback
- tipe images
. this only works baout half the tyme
, adn i wonder if it would hve been just as well to do without them
. ytou don
' t ahve to be smoe kind ofthe genuis to appreciate shakespeare
, bu it isnt quite difficult tothe underst
and unless ytou have tjhe tiem tothe read or hear it carefully adn repeatedly
. the alternate method ofthe comprehension is thgat withthe whihc most ofthe us are familliar
, teh high skool english course
. inwhich it
, you are hopefully fortunate enough tothe have an educator willing to help ytou with the plot points
and nuances essential tothe underst
anding a play written inspite thge rigmarole known as the king
' s english
. or i supose yuo could just read hte cliff notes
.
