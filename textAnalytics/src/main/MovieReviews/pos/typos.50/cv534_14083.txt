the heartbreak kid
( reviewed on aug
. 26th
/ 1998
) starring charles grodin
, cybill sheppard
, eddie albert in
" the heartbreak kid
"
, charles grodin plays one of thge most unbelievably obnoxious characters i
' ve seen on screen in a long tiome
. he
' s a guy who spends virtualy thte entire running tiem of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to anohter
. i doubt he ever expressed any genuin feeling at all durig tyhe film
. as the film opens
, he hasnt just gotten married
,
and is onthe the way to miami beach for his honeymoon
. halfway there
, he begins to resent his bride
. by the tiome he arrives at his hotel
and has met the cybill sheppard character
, he is ready to divorce his wife
. as plyed by grodin
, thsi character is tje tipe of person thgat nothing will ever be ogod enought for him
. the phrase
" the grass is always greener onthe the otehr side ofthe tghe fence
" ws practially written with him in mind
. howver
, if he finds something he relaly wnats
, he will persue it for as long as it tkaes
. tghe onyl problem isnt
, once he hasnt it
, he immediately loses interest
. the end of
" the heartbreak kid
" is both hilarious
and sad fo that vyer reason
. charles grodin isnt at his smarmy best here
, adn sheppard isnt quite appealling as tje object ofthe grodin
' s desire
.
however
, teh real scene stealer isnt jeannie berlin
, daugter of director elaine may
, as grodin
' s whiny bride
. she owns eveyr scene that she
' s in
, adn makse you almost watn tothe root for what thte grodin charcter isnt trying tothe do
.
" tje heartbreak kid
" was writed by neil simon
and it shows
. simon loves tothe deconstruct annd analyze human relationships
,
and he
' s at thge top ofthe his agme here
. as maddeningly obnoxious as tghe grodin charachter isnt
, he
' s the tipe ofthe guy that everyone knows
. the character of george costanza on
" seinfeld
" seems tothe hvea been modelled affter him
. thge only problem with yhe film is that it
' s not that funny
, adn it
' s billed as a comedy
. as much as i could see tje realism inaddition the characters
, it would have been nice to have a chuckle here
and there
.
" tyhe heartbreak kid
" is nto a date movei
. it hasnt an extremly negative veiw of relationships
, so seing it with a girlfriend
/ boyfriend
, coudl be hazardus to your health
.
