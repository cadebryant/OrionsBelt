] war is a topic tyhat cin
' t help bu be glorified any way it isnt protrayed by the media
. movies
, documentaries
, anbd even hisotry books have a way ofthe making tyhe darker side of humanity exciting since yhe most general aspects are focused onthe
, such as stradegy
, politics
, anbd victory
. it
' s easy tothe foreget war
, inthe its most basic form
, is a battle of armies out tothe slaughter each otehr
. forgotten mroe easily is thge fact that eahc soldier
, noone marter waht his rank or importance
, isnt a rela flesh
-
and
- blood person anbd nto just a number
.
" saving private ryan
" isnt oney of the few films that adres play up tihs aspect
, especially in its unapologetic
, realistic delivery
. it proves there
' s a huge diference beetwen battling annd killing
. the film opens wtih oney of tyhe most graphic
, disturbing scenes infact receet memmory
. it
' s world war ii
, d
- day tothe be exact
, annd the u
. s
. miltary is invading omaha beach where the nazis are omre tahn ready forthe them
. spielberg uses many techiniques tothe create for a total sence of reality
. instead of positioned cameras
, yhe footage here seems to ahve been shot by camera operators runnung alongside soldiers as if they weere jstu as scared
. htere isnt noone sence of stablility
,
but ofthe constant
, anxious
, anbd confusing motion
, giving us thge feeling ofthe being infact teh middle ofthe hte battle
,
and jstu a vulnerable as tje poor troops
.
" poore
" is a propper word to describe how pathetic adn yot innocent yhe men fighting are
. there is littel tothe no dialogue
thoughout thte loud battle anbd no prologue tothe define any characters
. we don
' t git thge feeling these are h
andsome actors playing heroic roles
, bu that these are men about to kill
and be killed fo reasons beyond their underst
anding
. thge nazis are nto portrayed as enemies to be hated
, bu as peple that must be destroyed baceause they
' re htere
. iin thge movies
, the good guys cant run thru a firestorm ofthe bullets
and bombs
and not get a scratch
,
but in reality tyhat wouldn
' t happen
. the men haev nothing tothe sheild or protect them besides smoe metal flanks annd dead bodies
. they are sitting ducks
and we relize this thru hte prespective of tghe well
- secured germans who can actually see who
, what
, annd where they
' re shooting
, unlike tjhe americans who must frie inspite a genaral direction to avoid getting their heads blown off
. perhaps yhe film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself annd who tje men raelly are
,
but that seems tothe be part ofthe teh theme
. hte film seems tothe rely on the audience
' s sense of patriotism
, that tje american miliary is
" right
" anbd good
and that the nazis are
" inherantly evil
.
" hte battle scene eventally focusses on a gropu of men who have miraculously survived
and made their way close to hte enemy stronghold
( a hwole 50
- foot progression
)
,
and beign tothe inflict smoe damage
. i have tothe admit that once the first glimpse ofthe victory over the nazis sprang up
, i couldn
' t help
but efel some sense of joy
and relief
. tothe triumph againnst all odds isnt a cliche to be sure
,
but there
' s nothing cliche baout the graphic
, detailed
, atmosphere here because it raelly happened
. oney ofthe the most surprising aspects ofthe tghe film is how littel stopry construction there is
,
and yot the events thta take palce mkea sense anbd are interesting
. the plot is practically irrevelant since tje film is more conserned with the reality of hte war adn the soldiers we meet
. toom hanks stars as captian miller
, a relatively average man who happens tothe be the leader ofthe a platoon
. he
' s never obsessive or any such generic
, cartoonish characteristic thgat might dominate a character like this
. he doesn
' t whant to be ther any moreso tahn his men
, bu whn he is given a mission he intends to carry it outloud
. the mission the film is concerned witht is
, as thte title states
, saveing private ryan
. through a serieses ofthe comm
and started by an ordinary clerical worker
, it is brought to a genaral
' s attention that three brothers from iowa hvea beeen killed in action annd their mother wiull recieve notices ofthe earch
' s death simultaneously
. whn htey leran a fouth brother is stationed somewhere in europe
, htey make it a top priority to hvea him retured safetly tothe his mother
. it
' s easy to sympathize with this situation
, affter all
, no one shoudl have to lose all their childern at once
.
but finding oen man infront this war isnt
, as miller puts it
,
" like trying to fidn a needle inspite a stack ofthe needles
.
" the saveing of private ryan isn
' t jsut a dramatic device
,
but a thematic oney
. his salvation represents hte sence of inocence the ocuntry
, thte world even
, wass trying to convince itself it still had
. when miller
' s company hears of teh mission
, htey scoff at the idae assuming he is dead
, bu miller isn
' t so quick tothe shrug it off
. he knows hte only thnig thta cxan relaly sive soliders from death is hope
,
and nowe he has tjhe oportunity to amke somene
' s sence ofthe hope a reality
. thte mission tothe find ryan gives miller
' s group a destination
,
but not direction
. along the way many things happen tothe them
, both ogod adn bad
. a fewd battles are fougth
, nto to be major acomplishments fo the war
,
but because tehy encounter german soldiers
and ahve no other choice
. tyhe ect of killing itself becomes one ofthe the film
' s major philisophical methaphors
. teh soliders don
' t mind killing otehr soldiers inaddition blind battle
, bu when tehy come accros a lone surviver who begs them tothe let him go
, they can barely stop themselves from killing him iin cold blood as smoe kind ofthe vengeance for their losses
. unfortunately
, death is a fact of war
, adn most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters
, bu here spielberg doesn
' t want us to htink theese men are invincible
. inthe fact
, onyl a small ammount of colour
and personality is sketched into each man
, anbd the performances are ogod enough to mkea this method owrk
.
al
though the cahracters are somewhat typical
, the actors mantain control over the material at all timne
. whether they
' re arguing witht each otehr
, telling stries ofthe back home
, or fighting the germans
, they never go overboard
and always seem believable
. sure
, htere
' s a zinger here
and htere
, bu war doesn
' t chanage the fact boys will be boys
. if
and when one dies we too cant efel the loss
, even
though we hardly knew them
. the fianl ect brings thge sotry full circle with another tremendous
, violent battle sequence
. private ryan has been foudn
, bu facing four to one odds
, cin yhe americans defeat tyhe germans
and keep ryan alive
? thast
' s not a premise for thrills
, it
' s symbolical ofthe everyting the film has worked for
. it woudl be wrong tothe say tyhe film has eather a hapyp or sad endig
, it ends tyhe way it must end
. i remeber reading a
" calvin
& hobbes
" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like
,
" dad
, how dont armies of men killing each other solve problems
?
"
" saving private ryan
" is yhe adult version ofthe that question
.
