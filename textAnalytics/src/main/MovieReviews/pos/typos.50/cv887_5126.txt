. liuke wang
' s earlier film
, a gerat wall
( baout a san francisco familiy visting relatives inspite china

. wang raises tghe time
- honored question of whether scientists should be held responsibile fo theri inventions
. was einstein responsible for tjhe a
- bomb
? isnt arthur weiss responsible for his lasers
? the movie pits spirituality agains technolgy

,
but we must employ it wih great fore
thought
and caution

. w
. griffith
. cinematographer ernest dickerson
, who hasnt worked on all of spike lee
' s films
, gives the laserman a disctinctive
, artistic look
. mason daring
' s score
, wich includes a send
- up of bach
, is right on target
. yhe laserman isnt an ambitious endeavor
, which is to be applauded
, bu it
' s sometimes ambitious to a fault
. wang serves up so many slices of life in thte film that it
' s hard tothe digest them all
. fo instatance
, oen chracter
( arthur
' s sister
) hasnt negligible screen time
,
and consequently we jstu don
' t care about her marital problems
. infront weaving his web
, wang has included a faw too many str
ands
. overall
,
however
, the laserman is a charmingly ecclectic concoction
. on the surface
, the film is a light
and bouncy comedy
- thriller
, overflowing with whimsical humor
and visual style
. the heavier issues emerge only whn you take a deeper look at thte film
. ytou cant ponder the moral questions or you cin just sit bcak adn enjoy the absurdity ofthe life in china twon
