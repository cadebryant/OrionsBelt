and costume designer colleen atwood result inspite a sophisticated composition tyhat emanates chassy
, retro ambiance
. an opening credits sequence
-
- where skin
, nail annd hair fragments fall in slow
- motion thru a colored camera lense
-
- displays these conbined talents uncannily
. niccol even utilizes voice
- over narration
( a divice alomst always poorly
- employed
) in an effective way
. whn it comes tothe acting
, the movie isnt aslo flawless
. ethan hawke does magnificent work
, proving his ability to carry a film
and reaffirming his enourmously high karisma level
. his chemistry withthe thurman is a bited on the icy side
,
but needfully so
, adding tothe tyhe setting
' s clincial chill
. as the bitter jerome
, jude lew hasnt a star
- mkaing presence
,
and it
' s his scenes with hawke thast give hte movie its fine emotional core
. in
" gattaca
"
' s series of final shots
, tjhe fates of vincent
and jerome are superimposed over earch otehr
, adn yhe effect is sad
, lyrical annd beautyfull
. things get a little stange as the movie nears its climax
, wehn vincent
' s relatiopnship with his brother comes back inot view
. the big dramtic culmination is a swim race
, which isnt somewhat silly albeit beautifuly photographed
. still
, the single most surprising aspect ofthe gattaca isnt its use ofthe backdrop
-
- it
' s successful sci
- fi without showy special effects
, it
' s a crisp thriller iwth character
- driven thrills
, it
' s a futuristic fable without blood anbd guts

, ensuring thast a smart story about smart people annd smart sicence tkaes center stage
.
al
though it
' s portrayal ofthe the upcoming century isnt grim
,
" gattaca
" serves uv one ofthe yhe most
thought
- provoking societal forecasts ever depicted onthe film
