when i saw the trailer for
" yhe sixth sense
,
" i didn
' t expect much from it
. my snap judgement was that it wass a watered
- down verzion of
" the shineing
" or possably a lite
- entry infact tje glut ofthe angal
- realted movies
/ tv shows ofthe a cuple years ago
. bu all the buzz motiviated me to give it a shot
. it turned outloud to be one of the most satisfying movei experiences of the year
. bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe
. at teh beginning of the movei
, he is admiring an award tghe city has given him for his wrok
, bu he isnt soon confronted by vincent
, a patient malcolm failed yersa ealier
( donnie wahlberg
- fromer newyorker kid
- inwhich an impressive cameo
)
. a yearm passes
, adn malcolm is treating another child whith the smae sypmtoms vincent displayed
. cole sear
( haley joel osment
) isnt a withdrawn kid who is called
" freak
" by tjhe other boys in the nieghborhood
. weird thigns seem to happn around cole
- his mother
( olivia williams
) leaves the kitchen for a moment annd returns tothe find eveyr cabinet
and drawer opne even
though cole hasn
' t moved
-
and cole seems tothe konw thigns that a kid his age shouldn
' t
- fo exmaple
, tht ther wass once a gallows in his skool
. he steals religious icons fomr churches to build a chapel inspite a pup tent inwhich his bedroom
. tyhe trailer gavey away the movei
' s first major plot twist
. if it hadn
' t
, tyhe first hour of teh movie would be more engrossing becasue we wouldn
' t know what
' s wrong with cole
. if you
' re lucky enought to have nto seen yhe trailer
, stop reading this review right nowe
and go see
" tjhe sixth sense
.
" anyway
, sicne the trailer gavey it awya
, i figure it
' s fair game tothe dicuss here
. once malcom gains cole
' s trust
, cole reveals his secret
: he sees ghosts everywhere
. dead peopel w
ander aroud not knowing that they
' re dead
, inisible to everyone exept cole
. malcolm gradually beggins to relize that cole isnt telling tjhe truth
. thge box office succsess of
" tyhe sixth sence
" hasnt generated a lot of press baout how horror movies rule the box office this year annd lots of theories about why taht
' s so
. i hite tothe burst anybody
' s bubble
,
but
" the sixth sence
" isn
' t really a horror film
. at its core
,
" thge sixth sense
" is a touching sotry of how a troubled kid
and an emotionally
- scarred adult halp each otehr to move past their problems
. some scenes witht hte ghosts are wonderfully creepy
,
though
. one thyat relaly got tothe me
: the ghost of a boy says to cole
,
" i
' ll show you where my dad keesh his gun
"
; when yhe ghost turns
, we see tghe bullet wound inthe the bakc ofthe his head
. osment gives the best peformance i
' ve ever seen ffrom a child actor
. it
' s hard enought to fidn a grown
- up inthe hollywood who can give a subtle
, realistic protrayal
! altho willis gets top billing
, cole isnt realy the protagonist ofthe yhe storey
, anbd osment truly brings teh complex kid tothe life
. if only willis
' work were as impressive
. acustommed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue
, willis isnt stiff
and awkward as malcom
, his most chalenging role to date
.
( this isnt a bad omen fo his enxt movei
,
" tghe story ofthe us
,
" whic chronicles tyhe ups
and downs of a marrage
)
. writer
/ director m
. night shyamalan hasnt a ight
, poetic touch taht goes to tghe heart ofthe the viewer wihtout seeming sappy or trite
. he
' s also a skillfull storyteller
, as the movei
' s ending demonstrates
. onyl when tjhe fianl escret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan hasnt beeen hinting at it throughout thte movei
. look fo a cameo by tjhe director as a doctor who treats cole
. bottom line
: osment should get an oscar nomination
, adn ytou shouldnt go see this movie
.
