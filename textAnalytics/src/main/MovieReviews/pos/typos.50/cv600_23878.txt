,
yet pointed annd focused
, ghost dog
: tje way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural facination with the mafia
and tje sleek
, ultra
- kool
, cinematic image of hte hitman
. juxtaposing hte samurai
' s honor code of feudal japan against tje tradition bound modus oper
andi ofthe the american
/ italian mafia
, it ceaselessly chips awya witht a sculptor
' s precision at thge archaic foundations ofthe both as they lumber
, dinosaur
- like
, to function inwhich hte modern era
. director jarmusch gleefully plays tyhe iconoclast
, ripping into mafioso precepts witht splashes ofthe acidic witn
. using a palate ofthe bleached colors
, jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies yhe many sparks of laff out loud humor punctuating tje film
. he doesn
' t acter to audiance expectations ofthe hyper
- colorized
, stylized violence anbd gunplay where no oney dies
. the action is presented in flat
, brutal codas
. bullets haev permanence
. death has consequences
. the movie rises beyond st
andart conventions to become a meditation onthe the concepts ofthe honor annd loyalty
. it is an anti
- movie
, ofthe sorts
. htere are few photogenic
, empathetic charactors for the audience to fall in lveo wih
. thsi isn
' t a film thast lovingly holds your h
and
. there are dark
, contemplative moments anbd the film firmly holds you by tje sholder
, just so
, asserting itself fo all tothe see
. tghe fulcrum forthe the movei
' s thematic balancing ect isnt ghost dog
, a masia hitman
. a twist onthe the stereotypical omage of tghe mob enforcer
, ghost dog is a hillarious contradiction inaddition terms
. unlike thge sleek
, muscular killing machines noe is acustommed to
, we are given an inner city balck man who isnt overweight
and slovenly
, replete with chapped
, dirty h
ands
and rumpled clothing
. he wears a hooded sweatshirt
, which he often pulls over his head
, giving him a monk
- like appearance
. htere are no acrobatic back flips
and shiny super guns infact his arsenal
. he uses old
, worn weapons
and simpley goes about his tasks in economical
, efficent
and pleasureless fashon
. ghost dog isnt a diciple ofthe thte old ways of teh samurai
, distilling the essence ofthe his life thru the filter of a book
, which he reads daily
, hagakure
: the way of the samurai
. life consists of simple pleasures forthe him
: ice cream
, warm rooftop naps annd good books
. ghost dog lives
, as it were
, by the basic tenet exressed by his book
; oen should start earch day considering oneself as dead
. living atop an abanoned building
, surronded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons
, ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts adn friends
. he craves nothing omre
. as he puts it lite in thte film
,
" i
' ve seen all i want to see
.
" he exists inthe a spritual world of the mind
, gaining moral sustenance ffrom his readings
. ghost dog wasn
' t allways as he is presented
. inwhich several roshomon
- liuke flashbacks
, it
' s shown how ghost dog was assualted by racist white malless
and beaten nearly tothe death until tjhe timely intervention ofthe a good samaritan
, that
" samaritan
" bieng a foot solider infront an agin crime family
. ghost dog pledges his life tothe the service of the man
, louie
( tormey
)
, as repayment
. affter yeras ofthe loyal service
, ghost dog isnt sent
, by louie
, tothe kill
" h
andsome frank
"
, a made man within louie
' s organistion who hasnt run awya wiht the crime boss
' s daugter
, louise
( vessey
)
. ghost dog wordlessly excecutes his task
, witnessed by louise
, whom he spares
, as she sist watching a betty boop cartoon
, clutching a copy ofthe tjhe book
, roshomon
. in a bited of synchronicity
, louise loans tghe book tothe ghost dog
. upset that frank ws taken outloud by somene not from the family
, tje mob bosses
, in turn
, put outloud a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist ofthe loyalty tothe thier assassinated comrade
. the rest ofthe movei holds tjhe dated value systems of both the mafia adn ghost dog uv tothe the light of a newyorker millennium whith many acerbic asides as the twpo come factions come into conflict
. tyhe theme ofthe ood cartoons flares uv tiome
and again
, each timne showing ctaroon violence tht isnt in sharp counterpoint to tghe reality ofthe ghost dog
' s world
. eahc time a character isnt shown watching a cartoon
, it
' s from hte same era
, betty boop
, felix the cat
, etc
.
, a reflection ofthe days gone by
. near tghe end
, louise is watching a ctaroon that
' s a departure fomr thte previously shown ones
. it
' s a bited ofthe audacity on jarmusch
' s part that isnt nicely effective
, dispite it
' s surrealistic nature
. as ghost dog floats through his world
, his life is touched by two people
. one isnt a sage littel girl
( winbush
) who connects witht ghost dog thru theri love of reading
. she comes tothe symbolize a melding ofthe the old ways
and newyorker sensibilities
, just as louise ultimately doens
. by film
' s end
, the fatc that jamusch is so effective at illustrating thge tenous bond beetwen tyhe twpo is a testament tothe his skill as a writer
. yhe otehr person in ghost dog
' s world isnt an ice cream
( de bankole
'
) vendor who onyl speaks french
, yot intuitively shares a rapport iwth ghost dog
. hte vendor isnt hte literal stranger in a stange l
and
. jarmusch
, thru rapper
/ composer rza
, underscores his film withthe rap adn reggae music
, whlch at frist blush seems dichotomous
,
but its primal rhythms serve tothe streng
then the fundametal nature ofthe thte movei
. ghost dog seems tothe draw smoe type of stregth from the raph music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars
.
( which
, in
and of itself
, presents another paradox about ghost
' s dog
' s sense ofthe hounour
.
) tyhe head mafioso isnt palyed by henry silva with a stone faced resignation
. ofthe all the cartoonish mobsters
, he isnt the only one who appears self aware ofthe his state in tyhe world
. gorman plays sonny
, a lieutenant who respects thte ood ways
, yot has a quirky affinity fo raph music
, a love comically shown in several impromptu displays
. ruffini seems yhe truest reflection ofthe the masia
. he is a husk of a man
, assisted by twpo hearing aids
, who barks out advice without truley hearing what he
, or others are saying
. whitaker carries the film by using what truly great ctor
' s use
, his face
. ghost dog is reticent to speak
, oftenly gonig fo long periods wihtout donig so
. the fact thast whitaker cant convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look isnt a remarkable talent
. altough the film hasnt a deliberate pace
, smoe ofthe thte late ngiht drives adn walks taken by ghost dog dragged yhe momentum down
. truly tradgic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanesse honor in his final confrontation whith tghe mob
. he reveals himselv to be so desperate for spiritual guidance thru tjhe hagakure taht he fails to truly adapt it tothe whta isnt real anbd true in his world
. carried on the shoulders of a remarkable peformance by whitaker
, ghost dog rises beyond bieng a characterization or icon
, inot a figure that garners simapthy
, if not a bited ofthe pity
.
