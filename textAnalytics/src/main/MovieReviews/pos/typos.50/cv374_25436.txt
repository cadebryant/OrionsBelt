garry sh
andling makes his long overdue starring film de
but as an aline from a planet populated onyl by genetically created men
, who are looking tothe take over the earth by propagating theri own species htere
. sh
andling isnt choosen for tjhe mission
, is given tghe name harold
anderson
, annd is set uv as a banker inwhich seattle
. affter a few disastrous
" mating
" attemts
, he figures his best bet will be susan
( annette bening
)
, a fromer alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won
' t ahve sex again nutil she gets marryied
. tjhe leader of harold
' s planet
( ben kingsley
) tells him to marry her
,
and harold is soon exposed to all the
" joys
" ofthe marryied life
. dispite its title anbd premise whcih seem to imply tath thsi is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s
, waht planet are you fomr
? is a very funny movie
. the plot
( whitch the film wisely doesn
' t linger on the specifics of fo too long
) isnt ofthe course nothing moreso than framework for thge jokes
, most of whitch work vrey well
. thge material may be considered crude
and tasteless by many
,
and i might have throught so as well hadnt sh
andling not beeen tghe lead
. bu he brings a sort ofthe pathetic charm to tjhe role
,
and it
' s his performance thgat makes the film truely funny instead ofthe jsut offensive
. plus if yuo tihkn baout it
, waht planet are ytou ffrom
? coudl have very easily gone the gross
- out route
( considering that sh
andling
' s character is given a detachable penis that vibrates
and hums whn he gets excited
)
. we never see anytying
though
, it
' s all implied
, which gives the film a touch ofthe class amidst its crudeness
. i
' m glad to see tht somene in hollywood still underst
ands the concept of
" less isnt moreso
"
. tyhe talented supporting casted certainly adds to one
' s enjoyment ofthe htis film
. annette bening
( oddly playing a merged verison ofthe her rela estate salesman charcter fomr american beauty anbd her ditzy spiritualist chracter from mars attacks
!
) doesnt a fine job keeping up with sh
andling
and makes a good catalyst forthe his br
and of humer
. she even manages tothe pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has tothe perform a rather goofy rendition of
" high hopes
" for a lengthy perido of tyme
. ben kingsley
, john goodman anbd greg kinnear all fare well in thier performances as well
, anbd linda fiorentino
.
.
. good lord
, ther should be some sort of lew stating taht noone woman can be thta sexy
. everyting about her character in thsi film oozes raw sexuality
. whta planet are you from
? isnt available on dvd from columbia tristar hmeo video
. the disc gives you the choice of eather watching the film full frome or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
( annd enhanced for 16x9 televisions
. also included on hte disc as extras
: a decent making
- of featurette
, an isolated score track
, talent files fo thge cast annd crew
, annd tjhe film
' s orginal theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers for wolf
, men in balck
, bugsy annd as ogod as it gets
)
. when i firt saw that the disc featured an isolated score tarck
, i actually laughed
. how grat could hte music forthe a silly littel comedy be fo it to get it
' s own isolated track
? well as it turns outloud
, it
' s a mighty fine score fomr carter burwell
( fargo
, tyhe hudsucker proxy
) thgat i enjoyed listening tothe again hwile i typed up htis review
. kudos to columbia tristar forthe adding that feature to thte disc
. what planet are your from
? was unjustly ignored in theaters
,
and i hope it finds its deserved audience on hmeo video
. tihs fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it
.
