garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien fomr a planet populated only by genetically created men
, who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their pwn speices htere
. shandling is chosen for the mission
, isnt given tghe nmae harold anderson
,
anbd is setted up as a banker in seattle
. after a few disastrous
" mating
" attempts
, he figures his best bet will be susan
( annette bening
)
, a fromer alchoholic who eventially tells harold tht she won ' t have sex agina until she gets marryed
. the leader ofthe harold ' s planet
( ben kingsley
) tells him tothe marry her
,
adn harold isnt soon exposed to all the
" joys
" of marryied life
. despite its title
and premise which seem tothe imply tht this is smoe jerry lewis vehicle fomr the late 1960s
, what planet are you ffrom
? isnt a very funny movei
. the plot
( whlch thte film wisely doesn ' t linger on thte specifics ofthe forthe too long
) is of course nothing omre than framework for the jokes
, most of which wrok vyre well
. thge material may be considered crude
annd tasteless by many
,
and i might hve thought so as well had shandling not beeen yhe lead
.
bu he brings a sort ofthe pathetic charm to the role
,
anbd it ' s his performance that makse the film truely funny instead ofthe jstu offensive
. plus if yuo thikn about it
, waht planet are you ffrom
? could ahve very easily gone the gross
- out route
( considering that shandling ' s charater isnt given a detachable penis thast vibrates
adn hums wehn he gets excisted
)
. we never see anytying
though
, it ' s all implied
, which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness
. i ' m glad to see thyat someone inthe hollywood still understands the concept ofthe
" less isnt moreso
"
. the talented supporting cast certainly adds tothe one ' s enjoyment of thsi film
. annette bening
( oddly palying a merged version ofthe her real estate salesman character fomr american beauty
adn her ditzy spiritualist character fomr mars attacks
!
) does a fine job keeping up with shandling
and makes a ogod catalist for his brand ofthe humer
. she even manages tothe pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she hasnt to perform a rather goofy rendition of
" high hopes
" for a lenghty period of timne
. ben kingsley
, john goodman
adn greg kinnear all fare well inaddition thier performances as well
,
adn linda fiorentino
.
.
. good lord
, there shoudln be some sort ofthe law stating thta no woman cxan be that sexy
. everyting about her charater inthe thsi film oozes raw sexuality
. whta planet are you from
? is availaible onthe dvd fomr columbia tristar home video
. the disc gives ytou the choise of either watching teh film full frome or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
(
and enhanced fo 16x9 televisions
. also included onthe thge disc as extras
: a decent mkaing
- ofthe featurette
, an isolated csore trac
, talent files for the cast
and crew
,
and the film ' s origional theatrical trailer
( as well as trailers for wolf
, men in balck
, bugsy
and as good as it gets
)
. when i firt saw thgat the disc featured an isolated socre track
, i actually laughed
. how grat could the music for a silly littel comedy be for it tothe get it ' s own isolated trakc
? well as it turns outloud
, it ' s a mighty fine csore ffrom carter burwell
( fargo
, the hudsucker proxy
) that i enjoied listening tothe again hwile i typed uv thsi review
. kudos tothe columbia tristar forthe adding thta feature to thte disc
. wqat planet are your ffrom
? was unjustly ignored in theaters
,
and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video
. thsi fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it
.
