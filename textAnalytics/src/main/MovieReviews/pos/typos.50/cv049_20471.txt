, i konw most ofthe yuo loved it
, annd i
' m not saying i didn
' t like it
. wqat i
' m saying isnt the first half wass extremly slow
. now seing thge trailer it makes you think the whole entire movei is oen big special effects show
. don
' t be fooled
, thsi movei has a big storey
. annd big chunks ofthe talky moments
.
but i wiull admit the speical effects adn tjhe acting were above par
, deserving tghe rating above
. ok now to the tsory
. well this may tkae a while
. ok frist of all
, our world we live inspite now
, is nto the real world
, actualyl we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix
. a man played by keanu reeves is baout tothe fidn that outloud
, when isnt kidnapped annd allmost coaxed to go inot thge real world
. he doens so
,
and finds out that he cant do anything
, be anytying he whants to be
. bu he hasnt tothe fight a
' matrix skipping
' bad guy
, who wants to send him bakc tothe his pwn world or destroy him
. laurence fishburne
, his guide of sorts plays his charcter well as doesnt keanu reeves
. bu i sat in thte theatre forthe over
and hour wondering where all the special effects weere
. yeah there weere smoe in yhe first half
but nto anough
. the trailer for this movei was realyl decieving making peopel thikn tht this ws a speshal effects laden movie
. nowe for the second half
, it is explosive
,
and saves tje movie
. smoe of the speical effects
and fighting weere breathtaking
. the soudn
, thge music
,
and all the effects weere effective
,
and thge lastr hour kept us entertained
. bu witht a runnung tiome ofthe 2 ohurs
and 20 minutes
, tihs movie is at least 40 mintues too long
. one owudl have wished for a better
' matrix
'
, bu i do have tothe say
, i doed like it
and i was entertained
