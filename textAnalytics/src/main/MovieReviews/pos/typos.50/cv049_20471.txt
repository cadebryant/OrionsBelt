warning
: contains waht the matrix is
. rated r forthe sci
- fi violence
. starring
: keanu reeves
, laurence fishburne
, joe panteliano some may be disapointed whith tje matrix
. i ' ll tell ytou i ws
. i sat there
and sat there
annd sat there waiting for something to happen
. now wait wait
, i know most of yuo loved it
,
and i ' m nto saying i didn ' t like it
. what i ' m saying isnt tjhe first half was extremely slow
. now seeing the trailer it mkaes yuo think tjhe wohle entire movei is oen big spacial effects show
. don ' t be fooled
, this movie has a big story
.
and big chunks of talky moments
.
bu i wiull admiting the special effects
annd tghe acting were above par
, deserving the rating above
. ok now tothe the sotry
. well this may tkae a while
. ok firt ofthe all
, our world we live in now
, isnt not thge real world
, actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix
. a man played by keanu reeves is about tothe find that outloud
, when is kidnapped
annd almost coaxed tothe go into the real world
. he doesnt so
,
and finds outloud tyhat he cant dont anything
, be anything he wnats tothe be
.
bu he hasnt tothe fight a ' matrix skipping ' bad guy
, who whants tothe send him bcak to his own world or destroy him
. laurence fishburne
, his giude ofthe sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves
.
bu i sat infront the theatre for over
adn hour wondering where all the special effects weere
. yeah there weere some infact thge first half
but not enought
. tghe trailer for tihs movie was really decieving makeing people think that htis ws a speical effects laden movei
. now for hte second half
, it isnt explosive
,
anbd saves the movei
. some ofthe the speical effects
adn fighting weere breathtaking
. the soudn
, the music
,
and all the effects were effective
,
adn the last hour kept us entertained
.
but iwth a running time of 2 hours
annd 20 minutes
, tihs movei is at least 40 mintues too long
. noe would hve wished for a better ' matrix '
,
but i do have tothe say
, i doed like it
and i wass entertained
.
