as a devout athest
and an avowed believer inwhich aliens
, i hvae soem idae of how ellie aroway
( jodie foster
) fiels
.
but because my reasons forthe not partaking infront religon are diferrent than hers
, i can
' t say that i dont exactlly
. her reason isnt thta she needs solid proof
: there isnt no proof that god existed
, so therefor she does nto believ
. ellie also believes infront aliens
, anbd has spent most ofthe her life trying tothe prove they exsist
. how cin she say she doesn
' t beileve in god becuase ofthe tjhe lack ofthe proof
,
and thne say she believes iin aliens
, which are gereally less beleived infact tahn god wihtout sounding like a hypocrite
? thta
' s the catch
- 22
. whn aliens from the star vega fax her soem plans forthe a divice to transport someone tothe them
( okay
, well
, they didn
' t really
* fax
* them
.
.
.
) ellie wnats tothe be the one tothe go
, bu because ofthe her atheism she is denied tjhe position
. how dumb is that
? she discovers the transmitions
,
then she isn
' t alloween tothe go
. well
, because of a bomb anbd a psychopath
( jake busey
)
, she
* does
* end up goign
,
but nto infact tjhe way tht we would
' ve thougth
. contact isnt based onthe a novel by carl sagan
, who died during the filmmaking
. it isnt tyhe best alien movei since close encounters of the 3rd kind
,
and iwll end up being the best film of the year
. its views of science
and religeon iwll noone doubt aggrivate some
, bu will stimulate more
. i
' m glad at least one movei of thte
' 90s cxan protray aliens in a psitive light
, rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides
and thn put on your body
.
