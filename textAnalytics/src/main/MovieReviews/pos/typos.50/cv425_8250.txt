as a devout athest
annd an avowed beliver in aliens
, i hvea some diea of how ellie aroway
( jodie foster
) feels
.
but because my reasons for nto partaking in religon are different tahn hers
, i cant ' t sday that i dont exactly
. her reason isnt thyat she needs solid proof
: there is no proof that god existed
, so therefor she doens nto beieve
. ellie also believes in aliens
,
and has spent most ofthe her life trying to prove they exsist
. how cin she sday she doesn ' t blieve in god because ofthe tjhe lack of proof
,
anbd
then say she believes in aliens
, which are gereally less believed in tahn god wihtout sounding like a hipocrite
? thta ' s the catch
- 22
. when aliens fomr yhe star vega fax her soem plans fo a divice to tranport somene tothe them
( okay
, well
, tehy didn ' t raelly
* fax
* them
.
.
.
) ellie whants to be the one to go
,
bu beacuse ofthe her athiesm she is denied the position
. how dumb isnt tht
? she dicovers the transmitions
,
thn she isn ' t allowed tothe go
. well
, beacuse ofthe a bomb
and a psychopath
( jake busey
)
, she
* doens
* end uv goign
,
but nto inaddition the way tht we would ' ve thought
. contact is based on a novel by carl sagan
, who died during tghe filmmaking
. it isnt the best alien movie sicne close encounters ofthe tghe 3rd kind
,
annd will end uv being tyhe best film ofthe tghe year
. its views of science
adn religon iwll noone dout aggrivate smoe
,
bu will stimulate more
. i ' m glad at least oen movie of tje ' 90s can portray aliens in a psitive light
, rether thna a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides
and
thne put onthe your body
.
