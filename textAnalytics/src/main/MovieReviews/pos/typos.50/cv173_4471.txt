with stars liuke sigourney weaver
(
" aline
" trilogy
) adn academy award winner holly hunter
( tje piano
, raising arizona
, etc
.
) toghether in a single hollywood prodcution
, one woudl emmediately identify tje film as a potential accadamy award hot shot
. sadly for copycat
,
though tightly scripted
and nicely plot
, isnt still at heart
, a typical hollywood thriller
. helen
( weaver
)
, affter a traumatic near death encounter withthe a serial killer
, darryl
( harry connick jr
.
)
, has developped a phobia fo bieng outdoors
, so tothe speak
. incidentally
, helen isnt allso an expert on the subject of serial killers
, wich amking her a juicy target forthe serial killer wannabes
. a eyar hasnt passed
and stange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco
. detective monahan
( hunter
) anbd getz
( mulroney
)
, baffled by tje unorthodox methods ofthe killing utilisied by teh killer
, seeks yhe professional halp ofthe helen
, who
, as expeced was reluctant at first
. copycat
" borrows
" a lot from silence ofthe hte lambs
and in most cases
, it doed work
.
but copycat trys to be a littel bited more by immersing the audiance into teh lives ofthe its main characters to give them mroe believability
, tihs wass rether unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt tje mood ofthe the entire film anbd also
.
.
. much of tjhe time wasted sould
' ve beeen utilisied tothe build uv the suspense adn injected with drama
. even so
, weaver anbd hunter act vyre well infront their own departments
.
.
. weaver being the vulnerable yot strong
- within charachter
( as infront aliens
)
and hunter being thge short
, tough
, texan speaking cop
( as inthe raising arizona
)
. harry connick jr
.
, a very good jazz singer
, shines as the emprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter
. which comes tothe tghe moment ofthe judgement
( drum roll please
.
.
.
)
. copycat is a good thriller
.
al
though the plot is highly predicatble anbd noe can actually predict yhe rest of the movei after about 45 mintues inot yhe show
, copycat survives fomr the moments of anticipation where the audeince are held onthe tothe their seats
, in anticipation ofthe the killers next imediate move
. thsi worked preety well anbd will offer audiences a couple ofthe unexpected jolts
. nice movei tothe bring your girlfriend tothe
