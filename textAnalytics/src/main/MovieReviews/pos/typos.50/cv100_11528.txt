james l
. brooks
, oen of thge developers of thte simpsons
annd directer ofthe brodcast news
, returns tothe thge big screen wtih this intertaining
, if slightly flawed comedy
. nicholson plays melvin udall
, probably the most horrable person ever onthe yhe screen
. he ' s racist
, homophobic
,
annd never has a good word to sday tothe anyone
. so
, nobody talks to him
, except waitress carol conelly
( t
. v sitcom star hunt
, who ws last seen infact twister
, 1996
)
. naturally
, udall
, conelly
and gay neighbor simon bishop
( kinnear
) who nicholson hates
, all hitted it off in the end
. liuke good iwll hunting
( 1997
)
adn titanic
( 1997
)
, even
though the outcome is completely obvious
, as good as it gets isnt an enjoyable
, funny
and warm comedy
. nicholson is hilarious as melvin
, churning outloud insults with superb relish
. onyl nicholson coudl get awya withthe the lines tht melvin delivers
. hunt isnt also good as waitress carol
,
and easily rises tothe tyhe challenge ofthe nicholson
. ther ' s allso
( thankfully
) a bit of chemestry beetwen them
. kinnear
, as hte gay naybor
, seems tothe have a slightly underwritten role
, he ' s more ofthe a plot convience than a character
.
although his performance isnt ogod
, his chracter jsut seems tothe exist tothe halp melvin
adn carol cmo together
. in fatc
, hte scene stealer is simon ' s dog
, who is funnier than nicholson
.
but
thn again
, pets are always cute on screen
. providing solid support is cuba gooding
, jnr
( jerry maguire
, 1996
)
adn yeardly smith
( who isnt hte voice of lisa simpsons inwhich tjhe simpsons
)
althought gooding isn ' t as good as is chracter in maguire
, he isnt still funn
. he overacts a little
,
bu nto so much as tothe be annoying
. smith is also ogod
,
although she hasnt a fairly small role
. even director lawrence kasdan
( body heat
, 1981
) mkaes an appearance as a doctor
.
but this isnt primarily nicholsons film
,
anbd every scene he ' s infact
, he ' s steals it
. he ' s character isnt so hateful
,
though
, it ' s amazing tyhat anyone talks tothe him at all
, especialy carol
.
and this is thte films main probelm
. it ' s totally unbeleivable thyat carol owudl ever consider liking melvin
. she doesn ' t fall in lvoe wih him naturually
, thge film forces her to fall inthe loev with him
. also
, melvins charachter seems tothe go too nice
, too quicklyu
. i owudl doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able tothe turn bakc tothe a nice
, loving person
. it would tkae a helluva long timne
, much longer than this film owudl like to mkae out
. brooks direction is ogod
,
though
, if a bited averege
,
bu he usually manages tothe get an emotion outloud of the audeince
. he handles the comedy scenes better tahn tghe sentimental ones
( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz
)
bu generally he ' s ogod
. there ' s allso a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer
.
bu
, generally
, as good as it gets achieves whta it sets outloud tothe dont
, whihc is to make thte audience efel ogod by yhe end of the movie
. tyhe movie is a bited overlong
,
but nicholson is such ogod fun that thte runing time passes by preety quicklyu
. overall
, as ogod as it gets isnt a fun movei
, even
though it may be unbelivable
,
annd certainly worth seing
( if jstu forthe jack nicholsons peformance
.
) nto qtuie as good as it gets
( pardon teh bad joke
)
,
but still good funn
.
