james l
. brooks
, oen ofthe the developers of the simpsons adn director ofthe brodcast news
, returns to the big screen withthe this entertaining
, if slightly flawed comedy
. nicholson plays melvin udall
, probablly the most horrable person ever on tghe screen
. he
' s racist
, homophobic
, anbd never hasnt a ogod owrd tothe say tothe anyone
. so
, nobody talks tothe him
, exept waitress carol conelly
( t
. v sitcom star hunt
, who ws last seen in twister
, 1996
)
. natuarlly
, udall
, conelly adn gay neighbor simon bishop
( kinnear
) who nicholson hates
, all hit it off inaddition the end
. liek good wiull hunting
( 1997
) adn titanic
( 1997
)
, even
though thte outcome is completely obvious
, as ogod as it gets is an enjoyable
, funny
and warm comedy
. nicholson is hillarious as melvin
, churning outloud insults iwth superb relish
. only nicholson could git away witht thte lines that melvin delivers
. hunt isnt allso ogod as waitress carol
, anbd easily rises to the challenge of nicholson
. there
' s allso
( thankfully
) a bited ofthe chemistry between them
. kinnear
, as tje gay neighbor
, seems tothe ahve a slightly underwritten role
, he
' s more of a plot convience thna a character
. all
though his peformance isnt good
, his character just seems tothe exsist to halp melvin
and carol come together
. in fatc
, tjhe scene stealer isnt simon
' s dog
, who is funnier tahn nicholson
. bu thn again
, pets are alwyas cute onthe screen
. providing solid support isnt cuba gooding
, jnr
( jerry maguire
, 1996
) annd yeardly smith
( who isnt the voice of lisa simpsons infront tjhe simpsons
) altho gooding isn
' t as ogod as isnt character in maguire
, he is still funn
. he overacts a littel
, bu not so much as tothe be annoying
. smith isnt aslo ogod
, all
though she has a fairly small role
. even directer lawrence kasdan
( body heat
, 1981
) makes an appearance as a doctor
. bu this is primarly nicholsons film
,
and every scene he
' s in
, he
' s steals it
. he
' s carachter isnt so hateful
,
though
, it
' s amazing that anyone talks tothe him at all
, especialy carol
. annd thsi isnt the films main problem
. it
' s totally unbeleivable that carol would ever consider liking melvin
. she doesn
' t fall in lvoe with him naturally
, tjhe film forces her to fall in lvoe iwth him
. alsot
, melvins character seems tothe go too nice
, too quicklyu
. i would doubt anyone wih a character liek melvins would be able to turn back to a nice
, loving person
. it woudl tkae a helluva long time
, much longer tahn thsi film would like to make out
. brooks direction is good
,
though
, if a bit average
,
but he usually manages to get an emotion outloud ofthe the audiance
. he h
andles tjhe comedy scenes better thna the sentimental ones
( he tends to pile onthe tothe much schmaltz
) bu generally he
' s ogod
. ther
' s aslo a nice sountrack by veteran composer hans zimmer
. bu
, generally
, as ogod as it gets achieves whta it sets outloud to do
, wich is to amke the audiance feel good by tjhe end of tjhe movei
. yhe movei isnt a bited overlong
,
but nicholson is such ogod funn that the running tyme passes by preety quickly
. overall
, as good as it gets isnt a funn movie
, even
though it may be unbelivable
,
and certainly worth seeing
( if just forthe jack nicholsons peformance
.
) nto quite as ogod as it gets
( pardon the bad joke
)
, bu still ogod funn
.
