i
' m an avid fan of the
" aline
" saga
, so thsi review is obviously a tad biased
( at least i admitted it
)
. ofthe course
, that doesn
' t mean that i
' m gonna be giving thsi a four
- star review or something
, because
" aline
: ressurection
,
" thge fourth film inthe the kool
- as
- hell serieses isnt nto an absolutly amazing film
, much like the frist two weere
. howver
, it
' s a vyer ogod film whic never fails to entertain
,
and consists of
yet anyother mutation inwhich tyhe style ofthe tghe series
. in short
, i had a good time
.
" aline
: ressurection
" leaves off 200 eyars aftter tyhe lastest one
, where our heroine protagonits
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
, tyhe science fiction genre
' s answer tothe job
, had killed herself after discovering taht an alien ws inside her body
, waiting to pop outloud liuke it doed to john hurt in the first oen
. of course
, the last oen wasn
' t veyr great or anything
( i liekd it
,
though not as much as teh firt twpo
)
,
and moreso importantly
, it wasn
' t financially succsessfull
( a tawdry 55 million bucks
!
)
. so back we are
, wih ripley back as a clone
, which means we get another littel satrical look at cloning
( not that that
' s a bad thnig
,
but it
' s becomeing a cliche
)
. so she
' s cloned aboard an even omre futuristic
- looking ship called
" the auriga
" by some doctors
( including the neccesary bad government guy
, dr
. wren
, plyed by j
. e
. freeman
, as well as thge little
- seen dr
. gediman
, palyed by none otehr than brad douriff
)
, mailny because htey hvae a version ofthe her with tyhe aline still inside her
. once yuo git past the fact tht you cxan
' t figure out where they got her blood
( altho i think it might ahve been ffrom tghe blood samples tooked by charles dance inthe tyhe thrid noe
)
, tyhe film
' s okay
. also on board are a b
and of mercernary pirates
, including michael wincott
, ron perlman
, kim flowers
, raymond cruz
, dominique pinon
( a jeunet sytable
)
and
.
.
. winona ryder
, who plays analee call
, who turns outloud to have a bited ofthe a secret
( i won
' t state it
, bu unless you
' ve been shacking uv with salinger forthe tyhe past two eyasr
, yuo probablly knwo all about it
-
al
thought it
' s nicely covered uv
)
. htere
' s a bit ofthe a non
- sexual
-
yet
- slightly
- homoerotic relationship between her
and ripley
,
but it
' s never really deepened enough
. oh well
. well
, as you might have guessed
, hte aline adn its spawn escape anbd run around thge ship
.
and it pretty much does awya witht most ofthe the peple on thte ship
( includng some shocks
- dan hedaya
, fo instatance
, who
' s death is comical
yet sad usance
, well
, he
' s dan hedaya
)
,
and tje remaining peple
( about 7 or 8
) are left tothe try annd escape adn stop the aliens fomr doing any major harm usance thte ship isnt heading quickly towords earth
. ofthe course
, the plot isnt all balderdash
,
and jsut an excuse for smoe good ood
" alien
"
- br
and funn
. tyhe rela focuse ofthe tghe series seems to be on sytle
, nto really substance
(
al
thought there
' s always a bit of it
, most notabley in
" aliens
" with tjhe relatiopnship bewteen ripley
and tyhe little girl
)
. what
' s intresting about the serieses isnt that eahc film is stylistically differnt in its approach
.
" aline
" isnt a claustrophobic exercise iin quiet frights
.
" aliens
" is a wild
, tense thriller
.
" alien 3
" isnt a obleek
, moody peice of semi
- noir
.
" aline 4
" isnt kind of liek an off
- beated french film
, filled wtih lots of humor
,
and kool scares
. jean
- pierre jeunet
( wihtout his usual directing partner
, marc caro
) creates a ship filled wih thte kind ofthe scares films liuke
" das boot
" hasnt
, wih echoes hinting at a possible threat
. the chills inaddition tyhe film are really cool
, especially with the music
, which isnt sometimes turned down completely fo certain scenes
( ther
' s thte most tense surgery scene sicne
" face
/ off
" towords tyhe begining
)
. annd nto every chill turns inot a bloody mess or anytying liek thta
. this all combined witht some ogod ood humer makes thsi as intresting visually anbd stylistically as teh others
. there are even a cuple scenes which just stick outloud afterwards as bieng brilliantly excecuted
. oen isnt yhe aforementioned surgery scene
. anyother oen takes palce betwen call adn ripley
, which is jsut awesome
. teh underwater chase scene anbd yhe ladder scene afterwards is one ofthe yhe most tense
, thrilling
, adn jaw
- dropping scenes inspite the entire saga
( witht a small alusion tothe jeunet
' s earlier film
,
" delicatessen
"
)
.
and the way they dont in tghe final aline isnt hysterically cool
( with a lovley allusion tothe
" goldfinger
"
)
. bu tyhe best scene in tyhe entire film
( i
' m sure i
' m not the firt to mention it
) takes place when ripley sees all yhe variations onthe her as tehy cloned her
( she hasnt a an
" 8
" tatooed onthe her arm
)
. it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga
. the screenplay by joss whedon is nto a gerat peice ofthe work
, as it never really deapens a lot of teh charactors
.
however
, it doens mkea us care baout most of them
, so tyhat when there
' s vyre little of them
,
and it looks liuke one or omre ofthe them may become alien chow
, we are preety scared
. annd
, yeah
, ther are smoe very funny lines
( ripley
:
" who dont i ahve tothe fuck tothe get off this boat
?
!
" johner
:
" well
, i cant get you off
. bu nto this ship
.
"
) tje acting isnt good all around
, with st
and
- outloud performances from ron perlman as thge male chauvenist pig johner
, adn lel
and orser
( tjhe poore bastad iin
" se7en
" who performes thte
" lust
" sin
) as an anxiety
- ridden wannabe woody allen who has an aline inside him
. winona ryder is good
, bu not amazing like she usualy isnt
( altho she meshes well wiht thte film
)
. of course
, adn as usual
, sigourney weaver steals tyhe sohw
. playing a variation onthe yhe ripley character
( less emotional
, adn more rude
and bitter
)
, she pulls it off hwile still being utterly lovable
. she
' s nto gonig to get an oscar nomination like she did for
" aliens
,
" bu she
' s just awsome
. overall
, it
' s a thrilling
, intertaining film whitch doesn
' t realyl amaze like the firt twpo
, bu is much more amazing than the thrid installment
. the style is hte best part ofthe teh film
, which isn
' t really a bad thnig
,
but it bieng thge best part takes away from a lot of tje depth the film occasinally trys to apply
. bu it
' s entertaining as hell
, anbd it
' s definitly ift fo the
" aline
" serieses
.
