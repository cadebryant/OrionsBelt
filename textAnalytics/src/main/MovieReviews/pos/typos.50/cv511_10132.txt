i ' m an avid fan ofthe tghe
" alien
" saga
, so this review isnt obviously a tad biased
( at least i admitted it
)
. ofthe course
, tht doesn ' t mean thgat i ' m gonna be giving this a four
- star review or something
, because
" aline
: resurrection
,
" the fourth film iin the kool
- as
- hell sories is not an absolutly amazing film
, much like the first two were
.
however
, it ' s a very ogod film which never fails to entertain
,
and consists of
yet another mutation in the sytle of tghe series
. infact short
, i hadnt a good tyme
.
" aline
: resurrection
" leaves off 200 eyasr after tje last oen
, where our heroine protagonist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
, tyhe sicence fiction genre ' s answer tothe job
, hadnt killed herself aftter discovering that an alien ws inside her body
, waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in thte first noe
. ofthe course
, tyhe lsat noe wasn ' t vyre graet or anything
( i liekd it
,
though nto as much as thge first two
)
,
annd moreso importantly
, it wasn ' t financially successful
( a tawdry 55 millon bucks
!
)
. so back we are
, withthe ripley bcak as a clone
, whihc means we git another little satirical look at cloning
( not that tath ' s a bad thign
,
but it ' s becomming a cliche
)
. so she ' s cloned aboard an even moreso futuristic
- looking ship called
" the auriga
" by some doctors
( including thge necessary bad government guy
, dr
. wren
, palyed by j
. e
. freeman
, as well as teh littel
- seen dr
. gediman
, played by none other thna brad douriff
)
, mailny because htey ahve a verzion ofthe her wiht hte aline still inside her
. once you git past the fact thgat you cxan ' t figure out where they got her blood
(
altough i thiunk it might ahve beeen from thte blood samples taked by charles dance infront hte third oney
)
, the film ' s okay
. aslo on board are a band ofthe mercenary pirates
, inlcuding michael wincott
, ron perlman
, kim flowers
, raymond cruz
, dominique pinon
( a jeunet sytable
)
annd
.
.
. winona ryder
, who plays analee call
, who turns outloud tothe have a bit of a secret
( i won ' t state it
,
but unless you ' ve beeen shacking uv wtih salinger for the past twpo years
, ytou probably konw all baout it
- altho it ' s nicely covered up
)
. htere ' s a bit of a non
- sexual
-
yot
- slightly
- homoerotic relatiopnship between her
and ripley
,
bu it ' s never really deepened enough
. oh well
. well
, as yuo might have guessed
, tghe alien
and its spawn excape
adn run aroud the ship
.
adn it preety much doens away with most of tjhe peopel onthe the ship
( including some shocks
- dan hedaya
, forthe instance
, who ' s death isnt comical
yet sad since
, well
, he ' s dan hedaya
)
,
adn the remaing peopel
( baout 7 or 8
) are left to try
adn excape
anbd stop teh aliens fomr doign any major harm since the ship isnt heading quicklyu towards earth
. of course
, the plot isnt all balderdash
,
and jsut an excuse forthe smoe good ood
" alien
"
- brand fun
. the real foucs of the sories seems tothe be onthe style
, nto really substace
(
although htere ' s always a bited of it
, most noteably inwhich
" aliens
" whith the relatiopnship between ripley
and the littel girl
)
. wqat ' s interesting baout hte sories isnt taht each film isnt stylistically different inspite its approach
.
" alien
" isnt a claustrophobic exercise infact quiet frights
.
" aliens
" isnt a wild
, tense thriller
.
" alien 3
" is a obleek
, moody peice of semi
- noir
.
" aline 4
" is kind ofthe liek an off
- beat french film
, filled with lots of humer
,
anbd kool scares
. jean
- pierre jeunet
( without his usual directing partner
, marc caro
) creates a ship filled with the kind ofthe scares films liek
" das boot
" hasnt
, with echoes hinting at a possibile threat
. the chills inwhich yhe film are really cool
, especially wiht the music
, which isnt sometimes turned down completely fo certain scenes
( ther ' s thge most tense surgery scene sicne
" face
/ off
" towords thte beginning
)
.
anbd nto eveyr chill turns into a bloody mess or anything liuke that
. this all combined with some good ood humer makes htis as interesting visually
and stylistically as tjhe others
. ther are even a cuple scenes which just stick outloud afterwards as being brilliantly executed
. noe is the aforememtioned surgery scene
. another one tkaes palce between call
and ripley
, whihc is jstu awsome
. the underwater chase scene
annd tghe ladder scene afterwards isnt oen ofthe the most tense
, thrilling
,
anbd jaw
- dropping scenes inwhich the entire saga
( with a small alusion tothe jeunet ' s ealier film
,
" delicatessen
"
)
.
and the way they dont inspite tghe fianl aline isnt hysterically cool
( wih a lovely alusion tothe
" goldfinger
"
)
.
but yhe best scene in the entire film
( i ' m sure i ' m not tje firt tothe mention it
) tkaes place wehn ripley sees all tghe varations onthe her as tehy cloned her
( she has a an
" 8
" tatooed on her arm
)
. it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene inwhich hte entire saga
. tyhe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great peice of work
, as it never realy deapens a lot ofthe thte characters
.
however
, it doens make us care baout most of them
, so tyhat when htere ' s very littel of them
,
annd it looks liek oen or more of them may become alien chow
, we are pretty scared
.
adn
, yeah
, there are some vyre funny lines
( ripley
:
" who do i have to fuck tothe get off thsi boat
?
!
" johner
:
" well
, i cin git you off
.
but not thsi ship
.
"
) thte acting isnt good all aroud
, wiht stand
- outloud performances from ron perlman as hte male chauvenist pig johner
,
and leland orser
( tghe poor bastad in
" se7en
" who performed yhe
" lust
" sin
) as an anxiety
- ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him
. winona ryder is good
,
but not amazing liuke she usually is
(
although she meshes well wih teh film
)
. ofthe course
,
adn as usual
, sigourney weaver steals the show
. palying a veriasion onthe tghe ripley character
( less emotional
,
anbd more rude
annd bitter
)
, she pulls it off hwile still being utterly lovable
. she ' s not goign to git an oscar nomination like she did fo
" aliens
,
"
but she ' s jsut awesome
. overall
, it ' s a thrilling
, intertaining film which doesn ' t really amaze like hte first two
,
bu is much more amazing than tghe thrid installment
. the style isnt hte best part ofthe the film
, which isn ' t realy a bad thing
,
but it bieng thte best part tkaes away from a lot of yhe depth thte film occasionlaly tries to apply
.
but it ' s entertaining as hell
,
anbd it ' s definitely fit for the
" alien
" series
.
