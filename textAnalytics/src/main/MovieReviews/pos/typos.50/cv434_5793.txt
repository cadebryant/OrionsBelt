- excerpt from twister prodcution notes i
' m sure many ofthe us living in htis part of teh world have never seen tornadoes
( or twisters
) before
. i for one
, have only seen the devastating effects annd footage of tornadoes from news reports onthe tv
and personaly
, i efel tornado
- caused destruction comes noone where near the destruction caused by hurricanes
and earthquakes
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
. that is until i saw twister
. the desctruction caused by twisters may be precice
( not widespread
but it moves very fast
and its path of destruction is unpredictable
. it wiull suck inspite cars
, houses
, livestock
, etc
.
.
.
.
. basicly anytying inwhich its path tyhat isnt not firmly rooted to yhe ground annd in twister
, you
' ll git tothe see all this
- close up
! twister tells a tale baout a gropu of storm chasers
. these people are basicly out
- of
- their
- mind anbd fo tyhe sake ofthe obtaining data on twister
- occurrances
, htey risk their lives by litterally chasing tornadoes
, trying tothe get as close as they cxan
.
.
.
.
. tht isnt if the tornado doesnt not suddenly deside tothe change its path towards them
! jo
( helen hunt
) is the leader ofthe this pack of kamikazes
. while tehy are gearing uv fo the mother
- ofthe
- all
- storms as predicted by satellite recon
, bill
( bill paxton
)
, a fromer co
- leader ofthe the team returns to suttle smoe divorce papers with jo
. aparently
, bill hasnt left his rogue
- ish dyas fo greener
and mroe practical pastures
- as a television weatherman
. he catchs uv whith his old
- self anbd follows tyhe pack liuke thte ogod ole dyas
, bringing his wief
- to
- be melissa
( jamie gertz
) allong
, a city
- bred woman toting around with a h
andphone
. jo has finally implemented bills initial idae ofthe a device called dorothy which measurement
' s of a twister may lead tothe a better underst
anding on how tornadoes are formed so that a moreso reliable eearly
- warning sytem cin be implemented
. the probelm isnt
, tghe device has tothe be placed veyr near the twister
, annd inspite its path
( whitch isnt practically unpredictable
) of destruction in order for it tothe function
. tothe add tothe thier current challenge
, there is another gropu ofthe storm chasers that isnt corporation
- funded led by jonas
( cary elwes
)
and they too haev a similar divice
. thus beigns the race
; jo
' s cheap govenment equiptment withthe beaten
- up vehicles against jonas
' s high
- tech computers
and sattellite link
- ups with theri sleek
, balck all
- terrain vans
. plot wise
, htere are not raelly anytying tothe shout about
. twister isnt as predicatble as any summer box
- office hit cxan get
. there is the danger of thte twister
, the completetion iwth jonas
^ os more well
- off team
and ofthe course
, the settling ofthe differences between jo adn bill
( this part gives tjhe film its human substace
)
. helen hunt
, bill paxton annd the rest ofthe the actors
/ actresses give only average performances
and all of them tkae bcak seat tothe teh main thespian inthe this movie
- the twister itself
! thanks tothe tjhe impressive digital effects by ilm
( lucasfilm
' s indutrial ight annd magic
)
, we git to see the terror anbd distruction caused by tornadoes uv close
; fomr stripping barns
and houses tothe lifting uv livestock
! jan de bont once agina proves his visual abiility
( thanks to his years ofthe experience as a director of photography for acation films
) forthe action sequences
. like his previvous film speed
, teh tornado sequences
( whihc are essentially teh acation sequences
) are well visualised
and edited
. audiences will be holding tight tothe their chairs everytime a tornado comes onthe screen
! hte surround sound effects sure doesnt halp a lot in stressing tje terror of a twister
!
( thge cinema must at tjhe very least wupport digital sound tothe fully apprieciate tihs
) twister is definitely an effect
- dependent movie
. now taht id4 fever hasnt begun to recide
, anbd peple are getting borde ofthe watching wiull smith whoop et
' s ass forthe thge umpteenth tiem
.
.
.
.
.
. twister is your sure bet ofthe 7 bucks well spent
! watch it in a ogod theatre
.
.
. please
