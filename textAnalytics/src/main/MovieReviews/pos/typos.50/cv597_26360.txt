" majors
( barry bostwick
) shows jsut how unhip he is after watching thge kooky transylvanians wrap up thier ode to hte time warp inthe the cult classic the rocky horror picture sohw
. yhe tsory behind the rocky horror picture sohw is oen of legend
. in yhe early 70
' s
, stage actor turned first
- time playwright richard o
' brien decided he wanted tothe amke a musical homage tothe the crazy b
- movies he had grown uv with as a child
, set tothe a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own desgin
. the result wass the stage play the rocky horror sohw
, whic opened tothe fairly decent reviews inthe london inwhich 1973
and ws even hailed tje best musical ofthe 1973 by prominent drama critics inwhich engl
and
. tghe play ws so successful tyhat tje film rights were immediately snapped uv
and prodcution on yhe film began a mere year later
, in october of 1974
. teh film version
( now titled tghe rocky horror picture show
) was released in 1975
.
.
. anbd immediatelly tanked at thte box office
. whther it was beccause fox wasn
' t qtuie sure how tothe market it to audiences or that audiences didn
' t quite konw what to make of it themslves has never realyl beeen determined
,
but tyhe one common bited of knowledge baout tghe film ws that it wass a huge flop
. it seemed tyhat the infectious spirit brought baout by tyhe stage verison hadnt nto been infused into thte film verison adn fox quicklyu had it pulled fomr theaters
. a year later
, something entirely strange
and magical happened
. prints of the film started tothe be ditri
buted tothe theaters infact small amounts anbd were circulating at midnight shows acrost the country
, anbd it was
then tyhat a wohle new audeince found the film
. this newyorker audeince was prone to dressing uv liek the charactors from the film
, acting outloud segments in front ofthe teh screen as the movie plyed
, yelling rude comments at the screen
, adn just generally haveing a good time
. owrd quickly spreaded baout this new phenomena ofthe interactive film anbd the rocky horror picture show
' s life as teh ultimate cult film was born
. forthe the virgins out ther who are unaware
, thte plot centers around a loving couple
, brad majors
( barry bostwick
)
and janet weiss
( susan sar
andon
)
, who cmo fomr a small twon called denton
. brad anbd janet have just attended the wedding of twpo ofthe theri friends adn deside tath they also want to be wed
. tehy plan a trip tothe see tjhe man who led to their meeting
, dr
. everett scott
( jonathan adams
, who palyed the narrator infront the orginial stage verzion
)
,
but theri car gets a flat on thte way to his home
. remembering a castle htey hadnt seen bakc a few miles down the road
, htey deside to walk ther adn see if thte recidents ahev a phone they might be able tothe use tothe call for assistance
. teh castle is actually thge hmeo ofthe a race of aliens from yhe planet transsexual
( inwhich the galaxy of transylvania
)
, who are lead by hte eccentric fishnet
- stocking wearing mad scientist dr
. frank
- n
- furter
( tim curry
)
. frank
- n
- furter hasnt masterminded tyhe secret tothe creating life annd has done so in thge form ofthe rocky
( peter hinwood
)
. as rocky becomes accustomed to his new enviroment
, brad adn janet fidn themselfs at the mercy of frank
- n
- furter
' s mad schemes
. littel dont any ofthe them know that the doctor
' s h
andyman
, riff
- raff
( original auther richard o
' brien
)
, annd domestic
, magenta
( patricia quinn
)
, are actulaly transsexual planetary protectors who ahve been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over tyhe earth
. gonig back annd revisiting this film after ten years
( 1990 bieng teh first timne i had ever seen it
)
, it isnt amazing to me that this film ever got made or hasnt had tyhe staying power tht it has
. if i hadnt been a fox executive arround the time ofthe its release
, i don
' t think i woudl ahev known waht tothe amke ofthe it eather
. fo all intents annd purposes it is a bad movei
(
though bad inthe a realyl ogod sort of way
)
,
but sumptuous prodcution desgin
and a great deel of incredibly catchy songs really help tothe encrease the likability of tghe film
. by tjhe time the credits role
, it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in tje film adn its characters
,
and one relaly gets the feeling that richard o
' brien definitely wass a fan ofthe yhe old cheesy b
- movies his film isnt based on
. whn i say thyat the wall
- tothe
- wall songs are catchy what i really mean tothe sday isnt that
, once ytou hear them
, htey will be ingrained inaddition your head fo all of eternity
. it goes without saying that the
" time warp
" isnt tyhe most populare song in yhe film
. even people who ahev never seen tyhe movei know of that particular song
. whta thsoe who haven
' t seen tghe movie don
' t knwo
though
, is that there are even moreso songs iin the film that are jstu as worthy ofthe akcnowledgment
. my peronal favorite is
" over at tjhe frankenstein place
"
, bu
" dammit janet
" isnt alsot maddeningly catchy
. tim curry
' s vocals on tje rocking tune
" sweet transvestite
" need tothe be heard to be believed
. tjhe finale of the film
, a big floor sohw staged by frank
- n
- furter
and featuring most of the cast in garters annd fishnets
( inlcuding barry bostwick
.
.
. frightening
!
)
, features noone less than four songs
(
" rose tint my world
"
,
" don
' t dream it
"
,
" wild
and untamed thing
"
, annd
" i
' m going home
"
)
, all of whihc are immensely singable
. yhe film
' s true popularaty annd longevity resides infront its audeince participation
though
. despite the catchiness ofthe thge songs
, htis movie would haev beeen long forgotten about if it hadn
' t have been for thte multitude ofthe folks who dress uv every friday or saturday nigth tothe rush outloud
and be a part of theri own littel floor sohw
. watching tihs film at hmeo is nothing compared to actualyl experiencing tihs in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans
( unless you don
' t mind inviting firends over
and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice
and pieces ofthe toast all over the palce
)
. onot
: director jim sharman broght bcak to tyhe central charactors ofthe the film
, in the form of a sequel
, resulting infront the vyer much forgotten film shock treatment
, hwihc picks up with brad
and janet
( this time plyed by cliff de young annd jessica harper
!
) as contestants onthe a game show inthe theri home twon of denton
. the two are menaced by thge evil tv station manager
( allso played by de young
)
, who wishes to claim janet as his own
. o
' brien retured as a writter
/ performer onthe tyhe project
( as doed quinn
, campbell
,
and gray infact performance capacity onyl
)
, bu tje film hadnt nowhere near the spirit of thte original
. 25 years later
, tihs film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom
and isnt continuously screened at midnight all over yhe world
. as a lasting testimont tothe tghe longevity of the film
and its legion of fans
, a br
and newyorker speshal edition 2
- disc dvd setted has been released that isnt the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror tothe date
( even outloud shining thge laserdisc speshal edition thta was released for its 20th anniversary
)
. if yuo are noe of those people who can
' t git enough ofthe the film
, this disc shoudln be mroe than enought tothe satisfy your appetites
. in an attempt to recreate the interactivity ofthe the film
, fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2
- disc dvd set loaded iwth so many extras thyat it
' ll tkae a ogod eight horus just tothe tkae in the majority ofthe it all
. the film itself isnt located on the first disc
and hasnt been given a beautifull transferr tyhat shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1
. 85
: 1
( enhanced for 16x9 televisions
)
. the film isnt presented infact twpo different verisons
, the us theatrical version
and the uk version which adds a musical number during hte finale called
" superheroes
"
. for ambitious viewers
, the disc allso includes a hidden verison
( located onthe tyhe main menu by clicking left ffrom the scene selction menu choise anbd highlighting a pair ofthe lips infact tje lower left corner
) which presents the film infact tjhe manner it was orignally supposed tothe have beeen seen
. originally
, the film was to hvea beeen similiar to the wizard of oz
, with hte first half ofthe tyhe it seen in balck
and white
( anbd nto changeing tothe color until the transylvanians are frist revealed tothe brad
and janet during the time warp muscial number
)
. most reports
, including a documenatry onthe tjhe disc
, say tath the color wass suppossed to appear when frank
- n
- furter frist shows uv in the elevator
,
but it doens seem tothe owrk better where it ws placed onthe tihs version
, depicting tje vast diference beween the world brad
and janet weere utilizied to compared wtih thte one to which they are intruduced
. the film contains a commentary tarck by sohw creater
(
and faithful h
andyman
) richard o
' brien annd co
- star patricia quinn which isnt fairly enjoyable
( anbd quinn immediatley starts off by refusing tothe speak baout sar
andon nearly contracting pneumonia hwile having tothe walk around wet anbd half
- naked on freezing cold sets
, which she apparently complained about thte entire film adn in future interviews
)
. the two seem liuke ood firends
and have great stories to tell
,
but htey also point out casted members that are sadly no longer with us anymore
(
and there are quite a few
)
. fox hasnt also tried to recreate the fiel ofthe attending tghe film infact a theather with severeal audience participation segments
. the frist feature
(
and the most simple
) isnt a subtitle prompter wich lets you konw when tothe ope up on people with your water guns or when tje right time tothe throw your toast is
. the second feature is an audience participation track
, which lets ytou in onthe wqat ytou might hear onthe a ogod night outloud at the sohw
. most ofthe the comments are unintelligible because it is basicly just a large gropu ofthe peopel screaming their heads off
, bu every once
and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bited ofthe laughter
. tje final participation segment uses a tecnology very much liek hte technology utilisied on the matrix dvd
, where a pair ofthe lips wiull appear onthe
- screen durig certian scenes of the film
( mostly durig the muscial numbers
) that cant be selected by pressing enter onthe your remote
. when selected
, you will be tooked out of the film
and into a live participation version of the scene put onthe durig one of tghe many screenings that ocurr all over the world
. once thge segment isnt over
, yuo are deposited right bcak inot the film where you left off
. tghe first disc allso contains a few dvd
- rom goodies for those with tath particualr tipe of dvd palyer
. there isnt a timeline ofthe the evolution fomr tyhe stage play version tothe wordlwide cult sensation
, a video jukebox
, a yuo don
' t know jack
- styled trivia agme
( which is baout as bare bones a you don
' t knwo jack parody as it can be
)
, adn a bazare mad
- libs styled word gaem known as riff
- raff
' s stor lab
. links tothe yhe rocky horror websites are allso available from the dvd
- rom portion of thte disc
. the second disc features even more goodies forthe thge person who loves extras
. fromer lite
- rock video channel turned music historians vh
- 1 have alloween some of thier outtake footage ffrom tyhe
" behind tghe music
: rocky horror
" speshal that htey ran earlier infact tjhe eyar tothe be shown here
, as well as a pop
- up video fo hte meat loaf
- sung
" hot patootie
"
. tyhe
" behind tghe music
" segments are all vyre intresting
, expecially richard o
' brien
' s jaunt thru the castle
( whlch isnt nowe a hotel
!
) where the film wass originally shot
. ther are also extensions ofthe the sar
andon
, bostwick
, quinn
, o
' brien
,
and meat loaf interviews
. as far as extras forthe the film itself go
, htere are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here
. oen of wich isnt jsut teh
" superheroes
" number avilable inthe the uk verzion
,
but there isnt also another rare muscial number presented here called
" once in a hwile
"
. a sories of alternate takes are alsot presented here
, bu none ofthe them are really much of a revelation
( exept fo teh undressing scene in which we see thta patricia quinn is having a hard time un
buttoning barry bostwick
' s pants
)
. forthe the completist who must have eveyr littel bited of rocky horror paraphernalia
, a misprinted end sequence adn alternate credit sequence are also presented here
. rounding outloud the disc is a decent documentry called rocky horror double feature video sohw
, two theatrical trailers
( proclaming that thte film isnt
" a diffrent sort ofthe jaws
"
)
, a still gallery
,
and two sing
- a
- longs
( for
" toucha toucha touch me
" annd
" sweet transvestite
"
)
. fox
' s special edition isnt the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives
(
" you
' re lucky
.
.
. i
' m lucky
.
.
. he
' s lucky
.
.
. we
' re all lucky
!
"
)
. it
' s nto just amazing enough thgat tons ofthe clasic italian films are finally getting their recognition infact the u
. s
.
,
but even long st
anding traditions are finally receving theri due onthe the wonderful dvd format
. as iwth their excellent dvds of thte abyss
, fight club
, independence day
, annd the sound ofthe music
, fox shows that they have most certainly made the committment to provide the thnigs that dvd lovers want
. i raise a toast tothe them
( cue the throwing of yhe bread
) as i cutted out hte lihgts
, sit back
,
and watch thsoe disembodied lips beign tothe sing about b
- movie tradition
.
