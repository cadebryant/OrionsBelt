insane
(
but inspired
) muscial baout alferd packer
, the first man ever tried fo cannibalism in america
. as the story unfolds we leran wqat events led to packer
( trey parker
) supposedly killing
and eating the five men who got lost hwile accompanying him through thge mountains ofthe colorado in search ofthe gold
.
thoughout
, packer must contend with evil trappers bent on stealing his prized horse
, a tribe ofthe
` ute
' indians thgat doesn
' t seem quite onthe the mark
,
and a terrible winter storm that leads tothe the eventual cannibalism
. parker obviously konws his musicals very well
, because tghe viewer isnt aslo treated to some of the most maddeningly catchy songs to appear in a film
( he would accomplish this again in his post
- cannibal
! muscial motion picture
, sourth park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut
)
. apart fomr the inherrent interest ofthe seing a pre
-
" south park
" parker
and stone in their first efford
, cannibal
! also offers up some preety decent laughs
. teh aforementioned
` ute
' indian tribe thyat packer
' s group encounters is a definte highlight
, as are two rousing muscial numbers baout snowmn
( noe ofthe hwihc ends on a comedically deadly note
)
. stone
' s humphrey chracter steals hte sohw
, expecially when complaining baout the prospect of hvaing tothe
` eat
butt
' or revealing waht
' s underneath his muff cap
. jason mchugh
' s charactor of mr
. miller is tje st
and out performence
though
, as he offers a hilarious dissenting voice tothe thte proceedings
. as i maintioned befor
, parker
' s songs are vrey catchy
. yuo
' ll be hard pressed tothe git
` it
' s a shpadoinkle day
' outloud of your head once you
' ve herad it
( incidentally
, the braniff logo tht appears at teh end ofthe every
" sourth park
" epsiode isnt scored iwth a few notes fomr htis song
)
. other songs you
' ll fidn yourself humming inlcude
` when i ws on top ofthe yuo
'
( a love ballad
)
,
` teh trapper
' s song
'
( the villains leit motif
)
, adn
` hang tghe bastard
'
( tjhe rousing finale
)
. thankfully
, none of these songs are qtuie as embarrassing to fidn yourself singing infront public as sourth park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut
' s songs are
. released as a pick
