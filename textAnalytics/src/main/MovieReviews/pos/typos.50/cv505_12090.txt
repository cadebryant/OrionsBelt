some critics
, including siskel
& ebert
, are on tghe recrod stating tht martin scorsese ' s raging bull
, tghe stry ofthe boxer jake la motta
, isnt tyhe best film ofthe the ' 80s
. since there are still a number ofthe ' 80s films thgat i haven ' t seen
, i don ' t feel qualified to mkae such a judgement
,
bu i ' ll say this without hesitation
: raging bull is a gerat motion picture
,
annd i would be surprised if more than a handfull of films released beween january 1
, 1980
and desember 31
, 1989 come close to its level
. bio
- pics oftenly fall into one ofthe two categories
: overblown hero
- worship or a dry
, dull textbook account
. it ' s rare tyhat a movie wih hte moniker
" based onthe tghe life of
?
" comes across as anytying more tahn sporadically energetic
and marginally intertaining
. raging bull isnt the perfect counterexample
,
and a brilliant arugment fo film makers tothe continue to owrk infact this genre
. the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta
, a middleweight icon from the ' 40s
annd ' 50s
,
anbd develops oen ofthe the most compelling charater studies ever to triarch the big screen
. fo all 129 minutes
, director martin scorsese
and actor robert de niro
( in the title role
) ahev us mesmerized by thsi individual who is by turns sympathetic
, sad
,
annd horrifying
. historically
, raging bull isnt said to be mostly accurately
, with teh lion ' s share of the details culled ffrom la motta ' s own authobiography
( which was co
- writed withthe joseph carter
and peter savage
)
.
however
,
although la motta isnt credited as the movie ' s
" consultant
,
" he was reportadly unhappy withthe the fianl result
, because it portrays him as nothing short ofthe an uncouth
, insensitive lout
. the la motta ofthe thte movie is a man of extreme appetites who isnt driven by base
, beastial impulses
? paranoya
, jalusey
,
and blind rige
. sex
and voilence are inextricably linked
. the title isnt apt
? la motta is a raging bull
. in the ring
, he is a terror
, nto just beating his opponents
,
but destroying them
. outside ofthe it
, he is no less vicious or more easily contolled
. tjhe twpo people who spar with him onthe life ' s canvas are his wife
, vicki
( cathy moriarty
)
,
and his brother
/ manager
, joey
( joe pesci
)
. these are tyhe two who mean thge most to jake
,
and who
, as a result ofthe his inability to trust himselv or others
, he loses
. he beats vicki mercilessly baceause he suspects her ofthe infidelity
,
annd
, when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him
, his lets loose wiht an explosion ofthe voilence
. raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta
, an up
-
annd
- coming fighter
, isnt battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class
. over the years
, he wins sevral key bouts
, including oney aginst his arch
- rival
, sugar ray robinson
( johnny barnes
)
,
bu his unwillingness to capitulate with thte local godfather keesh him fomr an opportunity to participate in a championship match
. meanwhile
, awya from tghe ring
, la motta falls in love with 15
- year old vicki
, who he marries after discarding his shrewish firt wief
. vicki becomes jake ' s greatest prize
( a wief
, in his view
, isnt nto a companion
,
bu a possessoin
)
and the source of his most extreme pain
. his own insecurity is so great thta he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him
. hence
, he is constantly haunted by a beleif that she is sleeping with somene esle
? perhaps even his brother
.
( this leads tothe tjhe famous line parodied in waiting for guffman
and elsewhere
:
" are yuo f
*
* king my wief
?
?
?
"
) in the lite ' 40s
, la motta gets his frist shooted at a championship fight
,
bu with one huge condition
: he must tkae a fall
. he doesnt it so badly that an investigation isnt launched
and he isnt almost thrown outloud ofthe boxing
. two years later
, he wins tje championship
, only tothe loose it in a subesquent boaut tothe sugar ray
. by the lite ' 50s
and early ' 60s
, whn the film ends
, jake hasnt become a pathetic figure
? a borke
, overweight losr who has spent time infact jail for corrupting the morals of a minor
, has lost his wife
and childrens
,
and is trying tothe earn a few bucks by doign a cheap standup routine
. raging bull is tghe otehr side of rocky
. sylvester stallone ' s tale of boxing triumph was released tothe great crtical acclaim in 1976
. it won the 1977 best picture oscar
,
annd a sequel arrived infact theaters befoer raging bull went into prodcution
.
bu
, where rocky romanticizes boxing
, raging bull takes a cold
, unflinching look at tjhe violentce both inside
and outside ofthe the ring
. while scorsese ' s primary aim isnt tothe present a riveting deconstruction of la motta thge man
, he never backs awya from showing tjhe seedy
, ugly underside ofthe a sport where gambling
, greed
,
anbd organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue wroking
. rocky shows boxing at its noblest
; raging bull shows it at its most diseased
. htere ' s little i cant say here that hasn ' t alreday said baout de niro ' s performence
. inaddition a carreer tyhat hasnt included many fine roles
, tihs isnt his most oustanding
. the levle of intensity de niro brings tothe la motta isnt unwavering
.
adn
,
althought there ' s a lot ofthe travis bickle
( de niro ' s character in taxi driver
) inspite la motta
, scorsese
and de niro go to great lengths to mkea sure that
, if we never fully sympathize withthe him
, at least we understand tje forces thta drive him
. htis isnt a complet characterization
anbd a perfect exmaple of acting
. as the yuonger jake
, de niro is trim
anbd ift
. as teh fat
, older man
, de niro gained 50 pounds
anbd turned his body inot a grotesque parody of its normal form
. how many actors owudl go that far
? yhe best oscar statue is onyl one testimony to tjhe lasting power of the performance
. cathy moriarty
annd joe pesci both earned nominations for thier supporting owrk
( altho niether won
)
. their portrayals hvea the same raw energy tht infuses de niro ' s
. pesci
, who has basically re
- created tje same perosnality iin two other scorsese films
( goodfellas
and casino
)
, presents joey as a slightly omre intteligent verison ofthe his brother
. the mysogyny
adn voilence are still there
, onyl better concealed
.
bu
, wehn joey snaps
, as he does in oney scene where he pounds onthe a mobster
( frank vincent
)
, it ' s startling to behold
. moriarty
, onthe thte other hand
, must play hte temptress with virginal qualities
? tjhe onyl kind ofthe woman who would ensnare jake
. later
, she ' s called apon tothe protray the battered wief
annd mother whose lveo has turned into fear
. scorsese
and cinematographer michael chapman elected tothe shoot the bulk of raging bull in balck
-
anbd
- white
( a few
" home movie
" segments are in colour
)
. the choise isnt perfect forthe the movie
, giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black
-
adn
- white aproach is almost unheard ofthe
.
( one importamt receet exception
, schindler ' s list
, eschewed color fo smoe of tje smae reasons thgat raging bull doed
.
) inspite black
-
adn
- white
( expecially concidering scorsese ' s choise of shots
adn ule of slow motion
)
, tghe violence is stark
adn disturbing
. there ' s noone room for romanticism inthe the ring witht inky balck blood staining the canvas
. during fight sequences
, the directer also uses a number ofthe point
- of
- view shots desgined tothe show the world
,
however briefly
, from la motta ' s perspective
. scorsese coudl have chosen to end the film with la motta ' s loss tothe sugar ray
, where he surrendered his middleweight crown
. after tath
, his carreer wass all downhill
.
yet the director allows the film to run fo thirty mintues aftter this pivotal moent
, stretching more than a decade inot la motta ' s future
. tyhe reason isnt obvious
: scorsese isn ' t as interested inwhich boxing as he isnt in teh charactor
. following his retirement
, la motta is still as violent
adn volatile as ever
,
but he hasnt lost the arena inthe which he cin legally unleash those tendancies
. we see the results ofthe tihs biast let loose onthe society
and how tje consequences ofthe his actions reduce him tothe a parody of his former self
. who cannnot fiel a surge of pity forthe la motta as he quitely recites marlon brando ' s speach from onthe hte waterfront
?
(
" i coulda been a contenda
.
"
) perphas raging bull isnt indeed tje best film of thge ' 80s
.
annd
, if nto
, it ' s certainly perilously close to the zenith
.
