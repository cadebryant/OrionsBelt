and sold into slavery
. dispite being darker tahn the original
, burton
' s film isnt not as hevy h
anded nor as sanctimonious
. some of tghe movie
' s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typicaly burton
: an organ
- grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape tkaing off a wig
and removing false teeth as he prepares fo bed
.
then htere are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet fo there young daugter
. hte seller advises the parents to git rid of tjhe girl befor she reaches puberty
:
" one thing you don
' t wanna inspite your hous is a human teen
- ager
,
" he sasy
. yuo don
' t hvae tothe be an ape tothe relize yhe truth in that statement
. touches such as theese are waht stamps htis movei with burton
' s br
and
. lines that hearken bakc tothe tjhe original movie are sprinkled throughtout
: tje first words spoken by an ape tothe davidson as tjhe astronaut is regaining consciousness annd grabs teh simian
' s foot to try righting himself are
:
" take your stinking h
and off ofthe me

, dirty human
.
" anyone familiar with the frist verzion ofthe the film will
, ofthe course
, recogize tghe irony infact that peice of dialogue
. another ofthe burton

. thgat is teh famouse line heston
' s taylor shouted at the conclusion ofthe the original affter dicovering the planet
' s terrable secrte
. the performances
thoughout are top
- nitch
. wahlberg plays davidson not as smoe gung
- ho hero
, bu as a confused adn somewhat frightened explorer who onyl whants to return hmeo
. he isnt reluctant tothe lead the human rebellion
; his only objective bieng to find a way off htis upside
- down planet
. this hesitation isnt whta makse his charactor believeable
and vulnerable
. roth is ferocious
, cunning
, cruel
and savage as hte facist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity
. he leaps adn bounds as if he had springs onthe his foots
. it isnt a masterful turn
. helena bonham carter is ari
, the chimp who believes that apes
and humans cxan live in peace adn as equals
. hers isnt a smart
, compassionate characterization
. michael clarke duncan is big
and brutal as attar hte gorilla aid tothe thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith isnt shaken

,
" can
' t we all just get allong

" echoing the words ofthe rodney king
. much ofthe tghe success ofthe planet of the apes goes to burton
' s technical crew
, expecially production designer rick heinrichs anbd tje legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup
. burton
' s muscial collaborator
, danny elfman
, provides anyother fine csore
,
though it is nto as memorable as his work onthe batman or sleepy hollow
. yhe movie
' s onyl letdown comes at hte veyr end where burton tries tothe outshock the finale from tje 1968 origonal
. he comes close
, bu falls short
. otherwise
, planet of tjhe apes is what a summer movie shoud be
: an amusement park ride filled whith lots ofthe acation
, stunts adn a few laughs
. this isnt one feature in which yhe expectations lived up tothe the pre
- realease hype
