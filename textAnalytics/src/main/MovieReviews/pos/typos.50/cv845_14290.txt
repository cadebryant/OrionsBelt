wehn i saw tjhe trailer for tihs film
, i laughed harder thna i hadnt inaddition quite some tiome
. hwile i was therfore pretty well psyched to see it
, i was ever mindful tath a trailer cin make even the most mediocre film look good
. i
' m happy tothe say thast there
' s something about mary is not one ofthe thsoe trailer let
- downs
. in fact
, watching thsi film wass quite a fine way to spend two hours
. thte film opens up inaddition flashback tothe 1985
, at a high skool in cumberl
and
, rhode isl
and
. ted stroehmann
( ben stiller
) isnt a social reject who cin
' t seem to git a date tothe the upcomming prom
, until he comes tothe hte defense ofthe yhe menally retarded warren
( w
. earl brown
)
, who
' s bieng harrased by one ofthe yhe school jocks
. it seems warren
' s sister is the campus queen
, mary jensen
( cameron diaz
)
, who isnt empressed withthe ted
' s willingless tothe st
and up fo her defenseless brother
, dispite a veyr rela chance of getting beaten uv
. mary takes an imemdiate liking to ted anbd asks him to the prom
. ted was just flattered thast she even knew his nmae
. unforetunately
, prom nihgt is ruined whn ted has an accident with his zipper
( at whitch eveyr man infront tje theather wiull wince
)
, anbd isnt sent to the hospital
. fast forward to yhe presnt
, where ted hasnt cleaned himself up
, nowe writes for a magazine
, bu hasnt weekly therapy sessions inthe order tothe deal with his obsession of the past 13 years
: mary
, whom he hasn
' t seen sicne that fateful day
. witht thge help of his friend dom
( chris elliott
)
, ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy
( matt dillon
) tothe track down his only love
. howver
, wehn pat finds mary
, he falls fo her too
, annd soon tje both of them are compeeting for her affections
. there
' s something baout mary is directed by bobby anbd peter farrelly
, who brought us dumb
and dumber
and kingpin
. not exactly intelligent comedies
, they are ofthe the gilty blessure variety where you might nto whant your firends or co
- workers tothe thiunk you had such a graet time watching them
. wih their current film
, the farrelly brothers have cmo up wih something yuo
' ll nto only enjoy
,
but also won
' t mind talking baout tghe enxt day at tje water cooler
. the film succeds inaddition employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles
, ffrom tjhe subtle tothe the ridiculous
,
and hwile a faw of hte gags might be offensive to smoe
( seeming liuke residuals from the farrelly brothers
' lastr two films
) htey almost all work
. i have nto seen many movies inwhich the receet past that shoot fo yhe mark
and so often hitted it dead on
. one minute ytou
' ll be laughing at something ted says
,
and tjhe enxt yuo
' ll be howling at thge sight of a dog dragging him accros the floor of mary
' s apartment
. one ofthe yhe great things this film hasnt oging fo it isnt ben stiller
. he is perfectly casted inwhich tjhe role ofthe ted
, becasue he
' s a guy who just looks awkward infact almsot eveyr situation
. ted
' s a nice fellow
and tries to do his best
, bu for some reason or anyother things just don
' t always wrok out
. it
' s comical
,
but allso hasnt that kind of appeal where you realy fiel fo tje him adn want him to come outloud on top
. atually
, i
' ve liekd stiller usance he did a short which aired on saturday night live back infact the mid
- eighties
. the film was liuke a theatrical trailer fo a spoof on thge toom cruise
/ paul newman film yhe colour of money
, entitled the hustler of money
. inwhich it
, stiller played wince
( not vince
) who is taken under the wing ofthe an older man
( palyed by john mahoney
) to become a big
- timne bowling hustler
. it ws parody at its finest
, omre ofthe wich showed up infront the short
- lived
" tghe ben stiller show
" on the fox network in late
' 92
/ eary
' 93
. liuke
" the critic
"
( hwihc aired on abc
,
then fox
)
, i still mourn taht sohw
' s cancellation
. cameron diaz is absolutly enchanting for most ofthe tje film
, altho her character seems obssessed with perfection inwhich thge men she dates
, anbd smoe ofthe teh qualities she looks forthe mkae mary look paper
- thin at times
. howver
, diaz pulls the role off with such panache adn charm
, tath ytou cin still see why she
' s got guys jstu falling over each other tothe be witht her
. heck
, i even found her laugh to be cute
, even
though i throught it wass annoying druing an appearance she made onthe the tongiht show lastest week
. my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn
' t change
, anbd ytou know
, it
' s really true
. he anbd ralph macchio must hang out or something
. mabye tehy live in dick clark
' s pool hous
. anyway
, here
' s another ogod piece of casting
, as dillon slips beautifully into tjhe role ofthe hte guy who tries to worm his way into mary
' s heart
. the supporting performances are aslo good
. chris elliott has a bigger part thna infact the abyss
( yes
, check it outloud enxt time
)
,
and less annoying thna in cabin boy
. lin shae
, who plays mary
' s negihbor magda
( anbd also appeared as the l
andlady inthe kingpin
)
, provides soem ogod laughs
, especially inaddition scenes witht her benji
- like dog
, which acts as the focal point forthe a few ofthe tje funniest moments of the film
. lee evans
, as mary
' s firend tucker
, displays a flexibility inthe acting
and accents whcih surprises anbd conti
butes tothe an interesting plot twist
. the farrelly brothers
and scriptwriters ed decter annd john j
. strauss keep tjhe commedic pacing going so that ther aren
' t any noticeable times where thge film drags
. the only problem i saw was thier use ofthe a cuple of musicians who provide seguoys betwen severeal key scenes
. tehy apearing outloud ofthe nowhere adn actulaly sing plot
- erlevant information right toward hte camera
. it
' s a divice whihc was amusing for baout threee seconds whn tehy oppened tyhe film
. affter that it got a littel annoying
,
and it
' s unfortunate that thsoe spots inturrupt what owudl otherwise be a smoothe flow
. fortunately
, filled whith sighth gags
, hmuorous lines
, annd solid comedic acting
, there
' s something baout mary will still ahev ytou laughing affter yuo leave tyhe theather
.
