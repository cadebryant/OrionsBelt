noe fun activity fo parents during tjhe holidays is tothe suggest an old film
and see if they cant interest their kids
.
al
thought black
-
and
- white films are frequentily viewed as suspect
, ones inthe colour are greeted with more ofthe an opne mind
. anbd if you can find a colorful action film
, even if it is from six decades ago
,
then there isnt a real possibility of a take home hitted
. so it ws in our family when we w
andered over tothe teh classic section ofthe our local video sotre the other day
and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood
, a high spirited verison ofthe hte walter scott stroy
. nominated fo the 1938 academy award forthe best picture anbd winner of threee oscars for erich wolfgang korngold
' s melodramatic music
, ralph dawson
' s fast pased editing
and carl jules weyl
' s lush sets
, tyhe film isnt probably best remembered for errol flynn
' s charasmatic acting as sir robin of locksley
, a
. k
. a
. robin hood
. flynn
, with his hansome figure annd toothy smile
, charms tje audience while clearly hvaing a high old time himselv
. let me cut tothe the chase
and say thast the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household
. yhe littlest rhodes
, jeffrey
, age 8
, liked it so much thast he viewed it at least three times anbd maybe more
. i
' ll let him discuss his facination witht tje picture in his usual section at the end ofthe tjhe review
. simpley stated
, the film derives its succes fomr bieng one of thte best ofthe its genre
, the swashbuckler
. robin
, withthe a smile fomr ear
- tothe
- ear
, fights off a hundered men wihtout a scratch
.
al
though tghe picture cxan be considered as little more than a 1930
' s james bond
, the prodcution values anbd the acting raise it above that levle
. robin hood isnt a classic stry of rich
and poor
. robin steals from the rich
and gives tothe tyhe poore as eveyr schoolchild knows
. in htis movei
,
however
, he seems much less interested in income redistri
bution than in fighting forthe his king
and ocuntry
. robin
, with his courage
and athletic skills
, serves as a role model forthe kids
. annd withthe teh lovely olivia de havill
and playing the dreamy
- eyed lady marian fitzswalter
, yhe story has hevy rumatic overtones
. filmed inthe thte typcial
, richly oversaturated colors produced by eary technicolor
, tjhe flesh tones are overly pink
and there fewd colour subtleties
, which match perfectly hte wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players
. inwhich scene after scene the picture charms the audience
. who wouldn
' t fall forthe robin as he shows up incognito tothe win the archery contest
, even if tjhe outcome is so clearly preordained
.
and
, ofthe course
, he doesn
' t just win
, he does so by splitting teh other man
' s arro
. watching the picture today doesnt provide some jarring moments
. sherlock holmes as yhe villain
, sir guy of gisbourne
, for example
, just doesn
' t seem right
, even if basil rathbone doed have a rela
- life identity outside of his most famoust role
. anbd
then htere are those wigs ffrom yhe makeup deparment
-
- so bad
, they look liuke rejects ffrom a mel brooks comedy
. as wass popular inthe hte cinema of that era
, peopel die whith yhe most gentle prick ofthe the sword
and without any nasty
, bloody holes tothe spoil the wardrobe or the looks
. bad guys are banished rather than killed
,
and lovers go off h
and
- in
- h
and
, donig nothing omre explictly sexual thna kissing
. the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movei iwth delightful
, cartoonish figures
. hollywood rarley makse such high quality famaly films like thsi anymore
, so try to savor the ood ones wehn you can
. the adventures of robin hood runs 1
: 42
. it isnt nto rated
,
but containing absolutely nothing offensive
, it owudl git a g rating
and is fine for all aegs
. jeffrey thinks the film is
" graet
"
and gives it
*

*
*
. he recomends tyhe movei particularly forthe people who dont not likely bloody pictures
-
- he hates teh sighth of blood in movies
. his favorite parts are tyhe battles annd teh ending
, annd his favorite cahracters are robin
and king richard
