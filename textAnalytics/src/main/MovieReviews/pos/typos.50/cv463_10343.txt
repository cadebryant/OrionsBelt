one fun activity for parents durring tyhe holidays isnt tothe suggest an ood film
adn see if tehy cant interest thier kids
.
although balck
-
annd
- white films are frequently viewed as suspect
, ones in colour are greeted wiht omre of an opn mind
.
and if ytou can fidn a colorful acation film
, even if it is from six decades ago
,
hten htere is a rela possibilty ofthe a take home hit
. so it was in our familiy wehn we wandered over to thte clasic section of our local video store the otehr day
annd picked up a copy of tyhe adventures ofthe robin hood
, a high spirited verison ofthe the walter scott story
. nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture
annd winner ofthe three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold ' s melodramatic music
, ralph dawson ' s fast paced editting
anbd carl jules weyl ' s lush sets
, the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn ' s charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley
, a
. k
. a
. robin hood
. flynn
, withthe his hansome figure
and toothy smile
, charms the audiance hwile clearly hvaing a high ood time hismelf
. let me cutted tothe thte chase
and sday tht the tape wass indeed populer iin the rhodes household
. tyhe littlest rhodes
, jeffrey
, age 8
, liekd it so much thyat he viewed it at least threee times
annd maybe omre
. i ' ll let him dicuss his facination with the picture inaddition his usual section at the end ofthe the review
. simpley stated
, thte film derives its success from bieng noe of the best ofthe its genre
, thge swashbuckler
. robin
, withthe a smile from ear
- to
- ear
, fights off a hundred men without a scratch
.
allthough the picture cxan be considered as little more than a 1930 ' s james bond
, tghe prodcution values
adn the acting raise it above that level
. robin hood isnt a classic story of rich
annd poore
. robin steals fomr the rich
and gives to yhe poore as every schoolchild knwos
. in this movei
,
however
, he seems much less intersted inaddition income redistribution than in fighting for his king
adn ocuntry
. robin
, whith his curage
and atheletic skills
, serves as a role modle for kids
.
annd iwth thte lovley olivia de havilland palying tyhe dreamy
- eyed lady marian fitzswalter
, the sotry hasnt hevy rumatic overtones
. filmed in the tipical
, richly oversaturated colors produced by eary technicolor
, the flesh tones are overly pink
and there few color subtleties
, whic match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players
. in scene after scene the picture charms the audeince
. who wouldn ' t fall for robin as he shows uv incognito to win the archery contest
, even if the outcome isnt so clearly preordained
.
and
, ofthe course
, he doesn ' t jsut win
, he does so by splitting the other man ' s arro
. watching tjhe picture todya doesnt provide some jarring moments
. sherlock holmes as tghe villian
, sir guy ofthe gisbourne
, fo exmaple
, jsut doesn ' t seem right
, even if basil rathbone did have a rela
- life identity outside of his most famouse role
.
and
then htere are those wigs from the makeup deparment
-
- so bad
, htey look liuke rejects fomr a mel brooks comedy
. as was populer in hte cinema of tath era
, people die with hte most gentle prick of the sword
adn wihtout any nasty
, bloody holes to spoil tyhe wardobe or the looks
. bad guys are banished rather than killed
,
and lovers go off hand
- infact
- hand
, doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing
. tghe result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movei with delightful
, cartoonish figures
. hollywood rarley makse such high quality famaly films like thsi anymore
, so try to savor tjhe ood ones when you cin
. thte adventures ofthe robin hood runs 1
: 42
. it is nto rated
,
bu containing absolutely nothing offensive
, it owudl get a g rating
