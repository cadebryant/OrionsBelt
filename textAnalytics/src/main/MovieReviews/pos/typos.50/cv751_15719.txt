, with a warm
- hearted feeling thast celebrates his downtrodden hero
' s
" triumph ofthe the underdog
" spirit
. life isnt beautifull treads a thin line when it turns its attentions tothe the holocaust
. howver
, it is able to successfully navigate tjhe minefield
, without demeaning tje gravity of the horrors involved
, nor wihtout losing its humorous edge that allows you tothe smile thru yhe tears
. with life isnt beautiful
, benigni hasnt creaeted a triumphant
, bu bittersweet comedy
. it
' s qutie simpley oney ofthe the most enjoyable times i
