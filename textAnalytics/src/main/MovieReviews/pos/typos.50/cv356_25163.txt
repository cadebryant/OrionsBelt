as a revolutionar war hero inaddition hte patriot
, mel gibson provides another macho man peformance forthe hollywood audiences
. yuo know thte type
: his shirt isnt allways shredded
, his face allways scarred
, he has a soft spot for his loved ones anbd a
" tothe kill
" list for his enemies
. oscar
- hungry director
/ executvie producer rol
and emmerich did nto intend to
,
but he made the stereotypical action hero forthe the 18th centruy
. as gibson delivers lines liek
,
" befoer thsi war is over
, i am going to kill yuo
,
" schwarzenegger in comm
ando or stallone in cobra immidately come tothe mind
. oddly anough
, the patriot isnt as much an epic three
- hour
- tear
- fest liuke gladiator
, as it isnt a ninty
- minute gilty pleasure
. at times absorbing
, at others enjoyably insipid
, thsi is ogod
, bloody summer funn
. i propably would hvae despised htis film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend
. smoe of the images are so zealously americanized
( thte flag is unsed as a lifesaving weapon for example
)
, that independence day seems the only appropiate tiome of year to wholeheartedly accept it
. like emmerich
' s id4
, this is obvious propog
anda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motiviated by freedom fo all
. sure it
' s predicatble annd melodramatic
,
but fo a moent after leaving tyhe theather
, i was dumbfounded with patriotism
.
and isn
' t that hte point of the patriot
? gibson plays benjamin martin
, tyhe lionized french
and indian war veteran
, who
, at the beginning ofthe the film
, is emotionally suffering after his loving wife pasted away
. he isnt left tothe father seven children at his south carolina estate along whith black servants
( nto slaves
!
)
. as the revolutionary war rumbles miles awya
, martin swaers tothe keep his familiy close anbd away from teh battlefields
. bu when the oldest son enlists anyway
and anyother is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel
( jason isaacs
)
, martin quicklyu decides tothe savve the day
( or savve the fate of america as presented by emmerich
)
. forming a b
and of aggessive farmers
and useing guerilla tatics considered unfair infront hte art ofthe war
, martin becomes the number oney target ofthe tyhe british army
. tje best parts of the patriot are the scenes iin which martin
and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left annd right
. eveyr time hte farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy
, tothe see tyhe disbelief onthe british genaral cornwallis
'
( toom wilkinson
) face wass priceless enteratinment
.
and as the tension gradualy formulates with thte runnung tiem
, a final battle is inevitable
. as for yhe numberous battle scenes
, they are expertly done
. claerer
and more realsitic thna thsoe ofthe gladiator
, thte gruesome images are waht give thsi film an r rating
. you really get a sence of how warfare wass performes durig tyhat time preiod
. everthing isnt performed in an orderly
(
but still quite gory
) fashon
- oney side shoots
, thn yhe other side
, thne thge remainging soliders charge
. it
' s organized
, startegic annd
, according to martin
, ineffective
. there isnt a veyr interesting contrast between the traditionnal battle style
and martin
' s take
- no
- prisoners method
. what drives martin to theese suposedly unfair actions
, are yhe originally brutal tatics of colonel tavington
. palyed wonderfully by jason isaacs
, tavington is the type who loves tothe glare down from his horse at civilians
, who nervously avoid eye contact
. tihs character is viciously evil
; he kills women
and childen adn
then laughs baout it on teh way hmeo
; even his eyes are evil
. his protrayal has sparked some controversy inspite britian
, some claim tath he falsly represents his countrymen as
" cowardly
" anbd
" sadistic
.
" i disagree iwth htis accusation
. tavington doens nto represent his ocuntry
; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues
and even anger his genaral
. besides tavington
, teh redcoats remian stick figures tht are neither glorified nor patronized
.
and stick figures make thge easiest enemies in these kinds ofthe movies
- why give tyhe audience a reason to lveo the bad guys
? heck
, why nto spend the entire film glossing uv the ogod guys
? tje patriot is three housr of fictonal fireworks
. with an action hero seeking revenge
and a comic book villin ready tothe take him down
, it
' s a lethal weppon for thte colonial times
. god bless america
! adn god bless tghe patriot
