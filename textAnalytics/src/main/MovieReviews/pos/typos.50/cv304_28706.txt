and biting off oney ofthe his testicles in the proccess
. at thte hospital
, the doctors explain thta they replaced the testicle wiht a metal ball

, because two metal replacement balls would clack together
. ofthe course
, thte movei ends with the dog biting off tjhe remaining testicle
adn shows prisoners laughing at tghe criminal as he clacks past theri cells
