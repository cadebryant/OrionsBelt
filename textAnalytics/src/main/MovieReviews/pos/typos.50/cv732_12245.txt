' s novel
, hwihc
,
though omiting some ofthe the political undertones
, remains true to tyhe overall story
and tone of hte book
. hopefully you won
' t
, as soem clueless members of the audeince doed
, wonder where all hte songs whent
. the movei manages to be completelyl engrossing without tyhe
andrew lloyd webber flourishes
. thte experince is bolstered by strong performances throughout
,
though neeson
and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles
. neeson in particular deserves kudos forthe his protrayal ofthe a man trying to dont good
, bu continually haunted by his past
. yhe supporting casted is allso extraordinary
. the only atcor who dims infront comparison is hans matheson
, playing the revolutionary
, marius
. thge film slightly loses its luster during his brief loev affair
, bu it is transitory
, anbd truly only distracting when contrasted wtih the rest ofthe the film
. the novel les misirables is
, by any account
, an epic
, both infront its scope
and in its length
. hwile it woudl be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages inot a two hour movei
, htis latest attemp doesnt an admirable job at tghe translation
. it
, too
, isnt an epic
.
.
. annd noe worth seing
