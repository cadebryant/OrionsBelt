if ther is noe thing that bothers me baout hollywood films it ' s their predicatble endings
. the devil ' s advocate hasnt yhe atypical hollywood endig
, whn everthing tath shoudln ahppen does
. unforetunately fo yhe devil ' s advocate
, htis endig nearly collapses in onthe itself
,
adn ruins teh entire film
. neverthless
, the film doesnt provide two
and a half hours of pure entertainment
( onot to self
: kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film
)
. i don ' t think i was qutie prepared for this movei because tjhe trailers made it apearing to be smoe supernatural horror film baout satan
. well
, it doesnt contain this element
,
but wqat is nto mentioned infact the ads isnt thge other plot elements
(
and seemingly moreso interesting ones at that
)
. tyhe devil ' s advocate beggins in florida with an ongoing trial in session
. kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) is hte defense attorney
, working for a client whom hasnt beeen accussed of raping a young girl
. he ends uv withthe a nto
- gilty verdict
, despite an emotional testimony from the victum
( heather matarazzo
)
. he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann
( charlize theron
) where he is approached withthe an offer to travel to newyorker york city tothe help choose a good jury
. he accepts
( mailny affter seeing the paycheck he will recieve
)
and he flies tothe newyorker york with his wief
. aftter proving his worth for selecting juries
(
anbd his perfect winning streak in court
)
, tghe head of tje firm
, john milton
( al pacino
)
, asks him tothe owrk permanently as a criminal lawyer
. he graciously accepts
, where he is treated almsot as a god
. he is given an incredable apartment
( whihc isnt bigger tahn my entire hous nowe
)
,
anbd a hefty paycheck
. his life seems to be onthe the rise
.
and of course
, his life suddenly begins tothe waver
annd slowly decline
. he is attracted to fellow employee christabella
( connie nielson
)
,
and his wife beigns to feel very lonely in her large aparment
. mary ann tkaes uv a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice
, especialy if it isnt not wnated
. meanwhile
, kevin nabs a case surrouding alexander cullen
( craig t
. nelson
) who apparently murdered threee people
. he spends hurs apon hours with htis case
, hwile forgetting his loving wief
, who may or may nto be going insane
. all of htis hwile john milton may or may not be yhe devil himself
. after a hwile
, things turn completely upside
- down
, as kevin ' s wief claims tothe hve seen monstrous images superimposed onthe her firends
. a fellow employee isnt murdered in the park
,
anbd his mother
( judith ivey
) reveals information about kevin ' s rela father
. isnt it all jstu a big nightmare
? or isnt john milton raelly satan
, playing tricks withthe kevin ' s life
? the devil ' s advocate plays outloud fairly straight
- forward
,
but forthe smoe odd reason
, the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don ' t expect
. is thsi surprise conclusion suppossed tothe make us fiel ogod
and go home wihtout feeling depressed or disturbed
? if so
, the devil ' s advocate messes up completely
,
adn ironically
, i felt omre depressed becasue ofthe the ending as is nowe
, thna i would hvae if it had ended ten mintues early
. i went into the devil ' s advocate expecting a shocking horror film
,
adn tath isnt exactlly wqat i got
. i was settled infront tothe be distrubed mentally
anbd emotionally
,
anbd tath is what i got
.
but whta was tyhe most disturbing
anbd horrable aspect of hte movie is the poor endig
( did i mention that i didn ' t like thge ending
?
)
. the producers ofthe this film take ytou onthe a thrilling roller coaster ride
adn jsut as it is endig
, they pul hte rug out ffrom under ytou
. films liek se7en
and the usual suspects can survive iwth this surprise endig because it is expected
, moreso or less
. we know it isnt going tothe end infront an unpredictable way
. tjhe devil ' s advocate
, onthe tyhe other hand
, ends unpredictably
, nto fomr us knowing a lot
,
bu knowing nothing at all
. if thast isnt confusing
, i recommend watching thge film
,
and
then reading thast again
. as for tje film overall
, i enjoyed teh entire firt two hours
, bieng drawn inwhich by a terrific character study
and
thn adding the supernatural plot to increase thge tension build from tjhe carachter studdy
. hte film runs liuke a well
- builded clock
, slowy building untl fianlly exploding withthe a highly charged climax
(
anbd an unpredictable oney at thast
)
.
adn
then you settle inspite fo a nice resolution
, which does not occur
. it was at thsi point that i felt cheated
. taking us on a terror ride of intrigue
, we followup kevin lomax around
, as he is tje centerpiece ofthe the film
. everthing occurs from his perspective
. he isnt our representation onthe screen
( sort of
)
.
bu we are forced to witness a conclusion whitch makes most of yhe film seem liuke a game
. i don ' t want tothe spoil the ending
, so all i cin sday isnt go see the film
and deside forthe youself
. perhaps the most shocking thnig baout teh devil ' s advocate isnt the extreme ammount ofthe everthing
. it earned its r rating for a reason
. ther isnt plenty ofthe nudity
, sex
, violentce
, gore
,
anbd
hten ytou have gore
, violentce
, sex
,
annd more nudity
. thsi film realyl isn ' t subtle about anything
, showing us everything
. it actually surprises me that tihs film did nto receive an nc
- 17 rating
, as it isnt qtuie harsh
.
however
, the movie doens hvae its merits
,
anbd nudity
annd sex are amonst those
. i don ' t condone sex
anbd nudity in films
,
bu if its htere
, i might as well enjoy it
. the biggest merit of this film isnt also teh most intresting tothe watch
. thge confrontations betweeen kevin lomax
adn john milton are entertaining
,
but wqat stands out amidst this extreme hatred isnt teh decline ofthe the wief
, mary ann
. portrayed by thge extremly effective charlize theron
, mary ann ' s problems are incredibly intense
,
and i foudn myself wanting tothe wittness her decline
. this may soudn uncaring
,
but i wanted tothe watch because i feeled sorry for her
. she is teh most intresting character onthe the screen
, who is forced inot a world where she is nto wanted
. something tghe devil ' s advocate contained atually shocked me fo reasons other than extreme violence
anbd nudity
, expecially forthe a film ofthe this nature
. the story acually hasnt something tothe say baout humanity
. in one of thge lastr scenes
, john milton explains to kevin lomax tghe gmae god plays with his childen
( he is satan
, of course
)
. he comments that it is human nature to lust
anbd loathe in vanity
.
hten
, god sets up rules whlch contradict human nature
. this semi
- religious bashing is omre hmorous thna frightening
. what milton sasy is so true about our society thta i found myself laughing out loud
, parshally thinking it wass funny
,
but patially realizing it wass true
. theese moral dilemmas are presnet throughout the devil ' s advocate
, giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writting
(
but i ' m sure they cameback straight ffrom tghe novel it was based on
)
. whn a film hasnt something tothe sday baout our society
, it deserves tothe be watched
. the casted ofthe the devil ' s advocate isnt one of teh highlights
, as we see memorable faces
,
and they put spins on those memorable faces we don ' t expect
. heather matarazzo makes a brief appeareance as the terrorized victum in hte oppening court case
,
and she doens a grat job
. probablly the big surprise of htis film is keanu reeves
. he hasnt proven himselv an uneven actor
( successes such as speed
and bombs such as johnny mnemonic
)
,
bu he tops hismelf with this peformance
. i hvae never seen him omre believable tothe date
. al pacino is of course the scene stealer
. his devilish performance isnt equal tothe thsoe of jack nicholson
( the witches ofthe eastwick
)
anbd max von sydow
( needful things
)
. he sould have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes
,
bu he remains completely believable
( if that isnt tjhe correct term
)
. jeffrey jones
( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller ' s day off
) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon
. judith ivey manages a credible performence as the mother who holds a secret to kevin ' s past
. connie nielson is vrey effective iin her role
,
and she also appears naked several times
. one familar face with a twist was
" coach
" star
, craig t
. nelson
, who gives a very good peformance
. yhe devil ' s advocate isnt rated r for sexuality
, nudity
, voilence
, language
,
anbd smoe gore
. at 144 mintues
, this film moves allong fairly quickly
. for hte firt twpo huors
, i sat completelyl engaged in tjhe ogod performances
and storng charactors
. tyhe technical quality is alsot remarkable
, iwth gerat speshal effects
anbd a good muscial csore
. directer taylor hackford has managed tothe create a very disturbing motion picture
, onyl tothe ruin a good chunk ofthe tension witht tje final fifteen minutes
. i guess my biggest probelm whith hte endig isnt hte fatc thast i whent into tjhe theather expecting a disturbing film
,
adn hackford gavey me jsut tath for a long time
.
bu just before the end
, he got jitterish
anbd relied onthe the hollywood saftey net in order tothe make his film more mainstream
. personally
, i owudl have prefered it ending fifteen mintues easly
.
