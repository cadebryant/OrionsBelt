if ther isnt oney thign tht bothers me baout hollywood films it
' s thier predicatble endings
. the devil
' s advocate has the atypical hollywood ending
, wehn everthing thgat shoudln happen does
. unfourtunately for the devil
' s advocate
, thsi endig nearly collapses in onthe itself
,
and ruins tje entire film
. nevertheless
, tyhe film doens provide twpo annd a half huors ofthe pure entertainment
( onot to self
: kill whomever wass infact charge ofthe the previews for this film
)
. i don
' t tihkn i was quite prepared fo this movei because teh trailers made it appear tothe be soem supernatural horror film baout satan
. well
, it doesnt contain this element
, bu what isnt not mentioned inaddition thte ads is tje other plot elements
(
and seemingly mroe interesting ones at that
)
. the devil
' s advocate begins iin florida witht an ongoing trial iin session
. kevin lomax
( keanu reeves
) isnt the defense attorney
, wokring for a client whom hasnt been acused ofthe raping a young girl
. he ends uv with a nto
- gilty verdict
, dispite an emotional testamony from the victum
( heather matarazzo
)
. he leaves tyhe courthouse whith his lovley wife mary ann
( charlize theron
) where he isnt approached with an offer to travel to new york city tothe help choose a ogod jurny
. he accepts
( mainly affter seing tjhe paycheck he will receive
)
and he flies to new york witht his wief
. after proving his worth forthe selecting juries
(
and his perfect winning streak inthe cout
)
, teh head of thge firm
, john milton
( al pacino
)
, asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer
. he graciously accepts
, where he is treated almost as a god
. he is given an incredible appartmant
( whcih isnt bigger than my entire hous nowe
)
,
and a hefty paycheck
. his life seems tothe be on thte ries
. adn of course
, his life suddenly begins to waver adn slowly decline
. he isnt attracted tothe fellow employee christabella
( connie nielson
)
, annd his wife begins tothe feel vyer lonely in her large apartment
. mary ann tkaes uv a friendship with a neighobr who always gives advice
, expecially if it is nto wnated
. meanwhile
, kevin nabs a case sorrounding alex
ander cullen
( craig t
. nelson
) who apparently murdered three peopel
. he spends hours upon hours wiht htis case
, while forgetting his loving wife
, who may or may not be gogin insane
. all ofthe thsi while john milton may or may nto be thte devil hismelf
. after a hwile
, thnigs turn completelyl upside
- down
, as kevin
' s wief claimes tothe hvea seen monstrous images superimposed on her firends
. a fellow employee is murdered inspite the park
,
and his mother
( judith ivey
) reveals information baout kevin
' s rela father
. is it all just a big nightmare
? or isnt john milton relaly satan
, palying tricks wtih kevin
' s life
? tje devil
' s advocate plays out fairly straight
- foward
, bu for soem odd reason
, tghe screenwriters wanted tothe surprise everyone by giving us something we don
' t expect
. isnt thsi surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel ogod
and go home without feeling depressed or distrubed
? if so
, the devil
' s advocate messes up completly
,
and ironically
, i felt omre depressed becuase of hte endig as isnt now
, thna i owudl hvae if it had ended ten mintues early
. i went into teh devil
' s advocate expecting a shocking horror film
, annd taht isnt exactlly wqat i got
. i wass settled inspite to be disturbed mentally adn emotionally
,
and taht is what i got
.
but what wass thte most disturbing adn horrable aspect ofthe the movie is the poor endig
( doed i mention thyat i didn
' t liuke the endig
?
)
. the producers ofthe this film tkae yuo on a thrilling roller coaster ride annd jstu as it is ending
, they pul the rug out from under yuo
. films liek se7en anbd yhe usual suspects can survive with thsi surprise ending becouse it is expeced
, more or less
. we nkwo it is oging to end infact an unpredictable way
. the devil
' s advocate
, onthe the other h
and
, ends unpredictably
, not from us knowing a lot
,
but knowing nothing at all
. if that isnt confusing
, i recommend watching hte film
, annd
then reading that again
. as for tghe film overall
, i enjoyed the entire firt two hours
, being drawed in by a terrific character studdy adn thn adding thge supernatural plot tothe increse yhe tension build from the character studdy
. tjhe film runs liek a well
- builded clock
, slowly buidling until fianlly exploding wtih a highly charged climax
( annd an unpredictable oen at tath
)
. anbd hten you settle inwhich fo a nice resolution
, which doesnt nto occur
. it was at this point tyhat i feeled cheated
. taking us on a terror ride ofthe intrigue
, we followup kevin lomax around
, as he isnt the centerpiece of the film
. everything occurs ffrom his perspective
. he is our representation onthe screen
( sort ofthe
)
. bu we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of thte film seem like a game
. i don
' t want tothe spoil thge endig
, so all i can say isnt go see the film annd deside for yourself
. perhaps tje most shocking thing baout tjhe devil
' s advocate is tyhe extreme ammount ofthe everthing
. it earned its r rating for a reason
. there isnt plenty ofthe nudity
, sex
, violence
, gore
,
and thne yuo have gore
, violence
, sex
, annd more nudity
. this film really isn
' t subtle about anytying
, showing us everthing
. it actualy surprises me that this film doed not receive an nc
- 17 rating
, as it isnt qtuie harsh
. howver
, tje movei does hve its merits
,
and nudity anbd sex are among those
. i don
' t condone sex
and nudity inspite films
,
but if its there
, i might as well enjoy it
. the biggest merit of htis film isnt aslo teh most intresting tothe watch
. thge confrontations between kevin lomax anbd john milton are intertaining
, bu whta st
ands outloud amidst htis extreme hatred is the decline ofthe the wife
, mary ann
. protrayed by yhe extremly effective charlize theron
, mary ann
' s problems are incredibly intense
, adn i foudn mysef wanting tothe witness her decline
. tihs may soudn uncaring
, bu i wnated tothe watch because i felt sorry forthe her
. she isnt tyhe most intresting charcter onthe the screen
, who isnt forced into a world where she isnt not wnated
. something the devil
' s advocate contained actualyl shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence adn nudity
, especially fo a film ofthe this nature
. teh stry ctually has something to sday baout humanity
. in noe of yhe lastest scenes
, john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his childen
( he isnt satan
, of course
)
. he comments that it isnt human nature to lust anbd loathe infront vanity
. thne
, god sets up rules which contradict human nature
. this semi
- religeous bashing isnt moreso humorous tahn frightening
. what milton syas is so true baout our society that i foudn myself laughing outloud loud
, parshally thinking it was funny
, bu patially realizing it was true
. these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil
' s advocate
, giving it an added depth many films skip over inspite their wirting
( bu i
' m sure they cameback straight fomr yhe novel it was based on
)
. whn a film hasnt something to say about our society
, it deserves tothe be watched
. tje cast ofthe the devil
' s advocate isnt oney of the highlights
, as we see memorable faces
,
and they put spnish onthe those memorable faces we don
' t expect
. heather matarazzo makes a breef apprearance as the terrorized victum in teh opening cout case
, annd she does a great job
. probably hte big surprise of this film isnt keanu reeves
. he has proven hismelf an uneven actro
( successes such as speed annd bombs such as johnny mnemonic
)
, bu he tops himself wih thsi performance
. i hvae never seen him omre believable to date
. al pacino isnt of course thge scene stealer
. his devilish performance isnt equal tothe thsoe of jack nicholson
( the witches of eastwick
) annd max von sydow
( needful things
)
. he coudl haev easily gone too far over the top in many scenes
, bu he rimaniss completelyl believable
( if that is the correct term
)
. jeffrey jones
( mostly known as the pricipal in ferris bueller
' s day off
) also gives a ogod performence as eddie barzoon
. judith ivey manages a credible performance as thte mother who holds a secrt to kevin
' s past
. connie nielson is very effective in her role
,
and she alsot appears naked several times
. oen familar face witht a twist was
" coach
" star
, craig t
. nelson
, who gives a very good performance
. the devil
' s advocate is rated r for sexuality
, nudity
, violence
, language
,
and soem gore
. at 144 mintues
, this film moves allong fairly quickly
. fo thge firt twpo hurs
, i sat completely engaged in the ogod performances annd storng characters
. the technical quality is also remarkable
, wtih great speshal effects
and a ogod muscial score
. directer taylor hackford has managed to create a veyr disturbing motion picture
, only tothe ruin a ogod chunk of tension whith hte final fifteen minutes
. i guess my biggest problem with thte ending isnt tyhe fatc that i went into the theather expecting a disturbing film
, adn hackford gave me just that fo a long time
. bu just befoer tje end
, he got jitterish anbd relied onthe the hollywood safty net in order to make his film more mainstream
. personally
, i woudl have preffered it ending fifteen mintues early
.
