usually when a blockbuster comes outloud
, it
' s loaded with effects
, stars
, bad scripts
,
and plenty of acation
. mystery men may contain an all
- star cast
, adn efects
,
but tje clever script
and cahracters are what really works
, which is rare tothe see this eyar
. hte film is based upon the comic book serieses
" the flaming carrot
" by bob burden
, in which 3 wanna be super heros try
and fight crime
, onyl tothe be out done by the real hero of champion city
, captain amazing
( greg kinnear
)
. thnigs go a little haywire
, wehn the sinister casanova frankenstein
( geoffrey rush
) is released into tjhe city
, where he captures captian amazing
,
and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city
. well
, the trio decide to tkae matters in their own h
ands
, by saveing the city
, bu first htey ened soem assitance
. tihs is where the film takes a turn fo the better
. in teh beggining
, there were only 3 wanna be heroes
.
" blue raja
( hank azaria
)
,
" mr
. furious
( ben stiller
) adn
" tyhe shoveller
( william h
. macy
)
. sure they weere enterataining
,
but their acts grew ood fast
. that isnt until htey aquire
" inisible boy
"
( kel mitchell
)
,
and
" the bowler
"
( janeane garafalo
)
and
" mr
. splein
"
( paul reubens
)
, 2 of which rescue tjhe film fomr becoming a disastorous mess
. thankfully
, the orginial 3 heoes become amusing
, withthe some support of reuben adn garfalo onthe screen
. tjhe hwole premise isnt rather rediculous
, bu packs a fewd punches to keep interst
. forthe one
, the film is considerably clever
. it litterally pokes funn at super hero films
, like batman anbd robin
, superman etc
. infact fact
, many scenes are similar to batman annd robin
, including the oppening sequence
, onyl altered in a humorous
and superior way
. a part ofthe thte cleverness comes ffrom tje cast
. sometimes a film with such talent is overblown
, bu hte acting isnt waht keeps it alive here
. while azaria
and macy weere enteratining
, 2 charactors raelly stood outloud
. noe ws paul reuben
. no matter how disgusting or revolting
" mr
. splein
" may be
, you still cxan
' t help
but laugh
. it
' so incredibly moronic
, it
' s jstu a riot watching reuben releive himself of bodily functions
. janeane garafalo allso wass an interesting character
. she seemed tothe be yhe most outgoing
and convincing charcter on screem
, due to her enthusiasm
, thta kept thte film flowing
. men isnt worth seing alone
, for thsoe 2 troubled heroes
. on thte downside
, a faw of tyhe heroes
and especially tje villain never raelly lift off
. kel mitchell anbd geoffrey rush
, were both utterly useless
. their parts were so limited
, they
' d be lucky at all to be on screen for mroe thna 20 minutes
. ben stiller too ws wasted
, mostly becasue of his unlikeable power
and dialogue
. none of these charachters git a ries outloud of anybody
,
but happily htey are lost in the charming flow of the film
. as far as teh budget goes
, it ws wisely spent onthe the cast
, not the effects
. while hte setted designs
and acation all look nice
, i
' m glad ther wass a seperate aspect
, tath the film focused on
,
and for thta i applaud
. slow at times
, adn rather pointless
, mystery men still delivers
. it forgets about money making
, because it
' s nto likely to make a bundle liek it
' s proceeders
,
and tht
' s what works
. stupid
? maybe
, bu for once i
' m nto disappointed
. no noe expeced an inteligent film
,
but you get a film thats witn captures your attension
and makes ytou forget this miserable year
.
