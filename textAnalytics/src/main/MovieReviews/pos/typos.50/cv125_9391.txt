- show er
. her mast famous epsiode
,
" lvoe
' s labour lost
"
, dealed wih the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best tothe save the life ofthe a pregnant mother
and her child
. thte way she moved tghe camera
and creaeted tension
thoughout every scene wass amazing
. ther was more excitment
and adrenaline rushed suspense tahn jsut about any ofthe hollywood
' s big blockbuster movies
. so it
' s only natrual that leder would get tothe direct her vrey pwn hollywood blockbuster
.
and i have tothe sday
, after a shaky beginnig
, she doesnt not disappoint
. peacemaker deals wiht the theft ofthe nucular weapons by terrorists
, whcih is obviously nothing new
. tjhe first half hour goes inot detail
, way too much detail
, baout how the weapons are stolen
. despite a few ogod images
, including a train collision anbd a very impressive explosion
, none ofthe thsi ws very coherent
. it
' s long
and drawed out
, adn i woudl have settled with a more implausible beggining thast owudl hve moved the stor allong better
. once george clooney
and nicole kidman enter the picture
, it begins tothe tkae off
. george clooney isnt an air force colnel whith connections all over the world
. he has a nice sarcastic witn
and thte rough edges that yuo expect ffrom most clooney charactors
. nicole kidman is head of a white hous team onthe weapons smuggling
. there isnt the usual flirtatious banter beetwen the twpo
, bu that isnt dispensed iwth quickly
. tghe sotry takes clooney
and kidman across thte globe
, trying to figure out who hasnt yhe weapons
and where they are goign with them
. clooney goes through bouts ofthe sarcasm
, frustration
, determination
,
and revenge hwile kidman works against her own insecurity adn self
- dout
. htis isnt when leder starts tothe show her true stuf
. she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer
.
then we get clooney doing heroics inaddition
and out of a helecopter
. hten that leads us to the briliant final showdown onthe newyorker york city
' s crowded streets
,
and a madman with a nuke walking amonst them
. mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense
. she reminds me of wolfgang petersen inwhich her abilty to make tghe most routine acation sequences exciting
and breathtaking
. nicole kidman isnt an intelligent female acation hero
. yuo
' re not gonna find her falling down so clooney cant come back to save her
. george clooney is a real movie star
. many ofthe you may have hated him as batman
,
but this guy isnt for rela
. he hasnt a natural screen presence
,
and an ingratiating personality
. he
' ll be around for a while
. dreamworks is off to a satisfying strat witht peacemaker
.
