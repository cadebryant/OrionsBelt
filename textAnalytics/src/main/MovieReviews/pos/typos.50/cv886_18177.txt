bob hte hapyp bastard ' s quickie review
: the mummy brendan fraser ' s stuck in the past agina
,
bu at least thsi tyme he hasnt something better tothe do than tothe quote sitcom lines
and try to woo alicia silverstone
.
.
. fraser isnt tje lead star ofthe tyhe mummy
, the second directorial efort fomr acation director stephen sommers
( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that ws deepo rising
)
. it ' s a rough adaptation ofthe the 1932 film
,
and i say rough because it focuses more on speical effects than onthe soem guy in bandages
, liuke boris karloff ws engulfed infact
.
but who cares
, the movei has a sort ofthe swashbuckling quality to it you cin ' t get from
, oh
, say
, godzilla or armageddon
. fraser plays a solider who gets a premonition during a battle witht soldiers in an egyptian ground
. basically
, it ' s a littel sign ffrom teh mummy burried underneath
- a priest named ihmoetep who wass buried alive forthe tkaing part of murdering thte king
and making out whith his mistress
. his plan
- wake back uv
and wake her up aslo
, makeing him invincible
. ofthe course
, fraser returns tothe tjhe site eyars later with a librarean
( rachel weisz
)
and her brother
( john hanna
)
, allong wih a fromer buddy ofthe his
( deepo rising ' s kevin j
. o ' connor
)
and soem
" americans
"
.
.
.
and guess waht
? yup
, ihmoetep
( arnold vosloo
) awakens
anbd wreaks havoc
. frie flies from thge sky
, flesh
- eating beetles crawl baout
,
and
, well
, ihmoetep ' s plan beigns tothe unfold
. ok
, so it ' s not realyl all tyhat newyorker a story
,
but hte way sommers tells it isnt entertaining anough
. tje special effects fomr indutrial ight
annd magic are top notch
,
anbd teh acting ffrom fraser
and weisz isn ' t half bad eather
. the action isnt preety intense
( favorite scene
: the sandstorm
)
adn there are a few shocking scenes jsut tothe jolt ytou horror
- loving folks as well
. noone
, it ' s no phantom menace beater
,
bu if ytou ' re looking for a solid warm
- up tothe hte summer movei season
, ytou won ' t find a better film under wraps than hte mummy
. if tihs doesn ' t give fraser forgiveness ffrom blast ffrom tje past
adn encino man
,
then nothing iwll
.
