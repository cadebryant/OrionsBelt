' s quickie review
: tjhe mummy brendan fraser
' s stuck iin hte past agina
,
but at least this tyme he hasnt something better tothe do tahn tothe quote sitcom lines adn try tothe woo alicia silverstone
.
.
. fraser is teh lead star ofthe the mummy
, tjhe second directorial effort from action directer stephen sommers
( who also brought us teh decent thrill ride taht ws deepo rising
)
. it
' s a rough adaptation ofthe the 1932 film
,
and i sday rough because it focuses more onthe special effects tahn onthe some guy in b
andages
, like boris karloff ws engulfed iin
. bu who cares
, the movie hasnt a sort ofthe swashbuckling quailty tothe it ytou cin
' t get from
, oh
, sday
, godzilla or armageddon
. fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soliders iin an egyptian ground
. basicaly
, it
' s a littel sign fomr the mummy burried underneath
- a priest named ihmoetep who was burried alive for tkaing part ofthe mudering yhe king annd making outloud with his mistress
. his plan
- wake bakc uv anbd wake her up allso
, making him invincible
. of course
, fraser returns to thge site yeasr later with a librarean
( rachel weisz
)
and her brother
( john hanna
)
, allong iwth a fromer buddy of his
( deep rising
' s kevin j
. o
' connor
)
and smoe
" americans
"
.
.
. anbd guess waht
? yup
, ihmoetep
( arnold vosloo
) awakens anbd wreaks havoc
. frie flies ffrom hte sky
, flesh
- eating beetles crawl baout
, anbd
, well
, ihmoetep
' s plan begins to unfold
. ok
, so it
' s not really all that new a stroy
, bu teh way sommers tells it is intertaining anough
. tje special effects from industrial ight annd magic are top notch
, anbd the acting fomr fraser adn weisz isn
' t half bad either
. teh action is preety intense
( favorite scene
: tjhe s
andstorm
) annd there are a faw shocking scenes just to jolt yuo horror
- loving folks as well
. noone
, it
' s noone phantom menace beater
,
but if yuo
' re looking forthe a solid warm
- up to hte summer movei season
, yuo won
' t find a better film under wraps thna the mummy
. if thsi doesn
' t give fraser forgiveness ffrom blast fomr tjhe past adn encino man
,
then nothing iwll
.
