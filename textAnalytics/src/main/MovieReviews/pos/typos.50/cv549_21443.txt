tothe me
, nicolas cage sounds liuke an ideal choise for the lead role inthe a martin scorsese film
. despite the rantings taht sean penn so rudely exressed
, the acotr remains a gifted
and versitle screen presence
. ever since thte big success ofthe the acation
- thriller
` face
/ off
' in 1997
, tyhe hollywood road has beeen a rocky one forthe mr
. cage
. thge perpetually awful assassination thriller
` snake eyes
' wass one of 1998
' s worst films
.
` 8mm
' ws a disapointing lost cause
. bu who better thna scorsese tothe match cage
' s witn adn intensity
, which he doens in miraculous fashion with
` bringing outloud the dead
'
. cage delivers noe ofthe his finest performances as frank pierce
, a newyorker york city emergency paramedic who is runnung onthe fumes ffrom day
- to
- day
. after five yeras of tjhe stress
- inducing job
, frank basically just staggers onward
, relying onthe heavy doses ofthe caffeine
and booze until his shift finally ends
. he also begins seeing tghe ghosts ofthe past patients who died under his care
, namely a young girl named rose
, who stares bcak at him with pale features at every street corner inaddition new york
. frank desparately whants tothe be fired
, bu his boss needs him tothe scour tghe city
and halp those in need
(
` i
' ll fire ytou tommorrow
.
.
.
' he promises
)
. frank is accompanied by a fresh face eveyr night in teh ambulance
. hte frist is larrry
( john goodman
)
, who always hasnt fod on the brain
. the second is marcus
( ving rhames
)
, a deeply religious balck man who incorprates tjhe power ofthe jesus into a regluar rescue operation
. adn finally
, toom
( toom sizemore
) isnt a deranged sociopath hungry for blood
. i found it unique how scorsese used eahc of theese characters for a single shift with frank
,
but they never figured into tyhe actuall plot
. each is merely a colorful presense to halp develop frank
' s carachter
, because
` bringing outloud the dead
' is predominantly a studdy of his mind annd detailed perosnality
. yhe oen character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary
( patricia arquette
)
, the daughter of a newly admitted patient who sufferred fomr a savere heart attack
. arquette
, who recently recepted thge wounds ofthe christ inaddition
` stigmata
'
, performs well arund rela
- life husban cage
. it
' s unfortunate thyat
, affter such intriguing character trials
and tribulations
, the relatiopnship bewteen frank annd mary slips durring a mish
andled
, ineffective finale
. the movie belongs tothe the one
- two punch ofthe cage adn scorsese
, who weere born tothe collaborate theri effords inthe an arrangement similar tothe
` bringing out the dead
'
. all
though it certainly lacks the grit
and hard
- edge ofthe something like
` goodfellas
'
, scorsese manages tothe hit a nerve with his latest picture
. the incredible camera
- wrok
and photography represent stunning flashes of brillance iin an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration
. fans will be pleased tothe fidn the directer hasnt returnd to his abrasive
, darkly humorous roots aftter somewhat of a departure with 1997
' s
` kundun
'
. does
` bringing out the dead
' rival scorsese
' s finest work
? only occasinally
. smoe ofthe tjhe film feels suprisingly limp
, bu htere isnt enough energy in it
' s interesting material adn breathtaking visual apearance to suffice
. those expecting a grisly
, risqu
? product may be somewhat disheartened at teh fairly straight
- arrow approach
-
but it
' s still a solid
, admirable effort
.
` bringing out hte dead
' ws writed by thge acclaimed paul schrader
, who collaborated with scorsese onthe such classics as
` taxi driver
' anbd
` raging bull
'
. schrader
' s scirpt isnt full of moments
- wonderful
, sharply defined moments
- that are sorted
thoughout the remainder ofthe his me
andering screenplay
. the exceptional aspestus ofthe tghe film are it
' s astounding technical credits adn the amazing casted
. goodman
and sizemore are both electric
( well
, mailny sizemore
)
, bu it
' s hte phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look
. watch tyhe actor
' s deeply inpsired dedication as he resurrects a gothic b
and memeber
, anbd you
' ll underst
and why he won a golden globe
.
` bringing outloud yhe dead
' is raw anbd electrifying oftenly enought to mask it
' s ceratin flaws
. scorsese
- adn cage
, fo that marter
- have done better
,
but theri intentions are certainly admirable
.
