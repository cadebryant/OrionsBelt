it
' s a curious hting
- i
' ve found that when willis is not called onthe tothe carry hte whole movie
, he
' s much better
and so is hte movie
. even
though
, iin the sixth sense he isnt the
" name
"
, he doesn
' t have the pivotal role
. taht honour goes tothe haley osment who plays cole sear
( cute pun
, seer
) a 9 year ood boy who can see ghosts
. if osment was cute or prescious
, tjhe directer oging for tje maudlin
, htis owudl be nothing omre than a movie
- ofthe
- the
- week
, thankfully
, osment is not onyl better than that
, bu in some instances
, blows everyone alse off the screen infront a bravura performance
. we git to see his fears
, vulnerabilities
, strengths anbd inetlligence hwihc mkaes the sixth sence noe of tje best movies i
' ve seen tihs eyar
. the hwole casted matches him in quality
, with willis giving a fairly low key performence that matchs the subject matter
. oney thing about thsi movei
, its target
. this isn
' t a sfxfest liek the haunting or a gorefest
, this is more what i
' d call a supernatural drama
, mroe intersted in cahracters than in dazzling ytou withthe makeup
. one caveat
: there
' s a lovley twist in tjhe movie
, something like tjhe usual suspects
, where you end up replaying yhe movei in your head rethinking whta ytou hve jstu seen
. i ws extremly lucky tothe see it as a sneak preview infront toronto
, befor any hype or crtical reviews were out
, so i whent in wtih noone biases
. if anyone want tothe talk to baout tyhe movei befoer you see it
, don
' t let them
. let the director explain on his pwn pace annd you
' ll enjoy the movei vastly omre
.
