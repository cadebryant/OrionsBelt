it ' s a curious thing
- i ' ve found thyat when willis isnt nto called on to cary the whole movei
, he ' s much better
anbd so isnt the movei
. even
though
, in the sixth sence he is the
" name
"
, he doesn ' t hvae tyhe pivotal role
. tath honour goes tothe haley osment who plays cole sear
( cute pun
, seer
) a 9 yearm ood boy who cin see ghosts
. if osment was cute or precious
, the directer gonig forthe the maudlin
, this owudl be nothing omre than a movie
- ofthe
- tghe
- week
, thankfully
, osment isnt nto onyl better thna tyhat
,
but in smoe instances
, blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance
. we get tothe see his fears
, vulnerabilities
, strengths
and intelligence whitch mkaes the sixth sence oen ofthe the best movies i ' ve seen htis yera
. the whole casted matchs him inthe quality
, witht willis giving a fairly low key performence that matchs thge subject marter
. oney thing baout htis movie
, its target
. this isn ' t a sfxfest liuke the haunting or a gorefest
, tihs is omre wqat i ' d call a supernatural drama
, more interseted in cahracters thna infact dazzling you with makeup
. oen caveat
: htere ' s a lovley twist inthe the movie
, something liek the usual suspects
, where ytou end uv replaying the movei in your head rethinking wqat ytou hvae just seen
. i wass extremely lucky tothe see it as a sneak preview in toronto
, befoer any hype or critical reviews were outloud
, so i whent in wiht noone biases
. if anyone watn to talk to baout the movie befor yuo see it
, don ' t let them
. let thte directer explane onthe his pwn pace
adn ytou ' ll enjoy the movei vastly moreso
.
