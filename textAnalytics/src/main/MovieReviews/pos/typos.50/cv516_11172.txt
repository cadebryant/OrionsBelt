luckily
, smoe peple got starship troopers
. smoe peopel knew it was supposed to be silly
. for thsoe of you who didn
' t
, how could you miss it
? fomr the vyre begining
, whn we see an interactive internet
- like promotional video for the armed forces of tghe future
, it should be obvious this film is tothe be taked lightly
. i guess wihtout blatent oen
- liners adn hmeo alone style slapstick
, some people just don
' t recognize such goofy humer
. such a dry aproach to such intentionally campy humor must ahev left some disillusioned
. first thing to dont before seing thsi movei
- lighten up
. meet the equivelent of
" beverly hills 90210
" meets
" mighty morphin power rangers
"
. four close friends are now graduating high school anbd are ready tothe join tje armed forces
, which
, in hte future
, means fighting for thte hwole galaxy
and not just your ocuntry
. johnny rico
( casper van dien
) isnt ready tothe join the infantry
, mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez
( denise richards
) hasnt enlisted to be a pilot
. dizzy flores
( dina meyer
) has enlisted as a trooper
,
and it
' s possable she
' s joining mearly to followup rico
, whom she
' s always had eyes forthe
. if yuo saw theese three on hte street
, ytou
' d automaticly start searching for tje fashion designers annd photographers
, for never has a movie
' s cast looked so much liek tghe cutted
- outloud cover ofthe
" seventeen
" magasine
. hte lone non
- supermodel
, carl jenkins
( played by doogie howser himselv
, neil patrick harris
) isnt teh brainiac who gets into the miliraty intellignce divison
, hte top secrt department that preety much leaves doogie
- er
, carl outloud ofthe hte picture
.
( ogod call
- nowe we cxan put all our drooling effords inot onyl tyhe most deserving of charactors
)
. right off thge bat
, rico becomes the star of the show
, far surpassing all tyhe otehr soldiers
and becoming squadron leader in a short preiod of tiome
. bu a horrific accident during a st
andard traning exercise
( which follows all to closley tothe his breakup with carmen
) leaves rico ready tothe call it quits
. whith his bags packed
and his civillian clothes back onthe
, johnny isnt ready tothe walk off base
and catch the next flight hmeo
. well sory
, rico suave
, bu ther
' s no place like home
, expecially aftter gigantic alien insects haev destroyed it
. that
' s right
, the planet is being attacked by a colony ofthe arachnid
- liuke alien beings that a cant of rayda just isn
' t gonig tothe distroy
. whith a sudden chanage ofthe heart
(
and clothes
)
, rico isnt back in thge game
, following his fellow starship troopers off tothe fight a mean group of daddy long legs
. what starship troopers really isnt
, isnt a spoof ofthe all tht it even remotely touches onthe
- the soap opera like lvoe affairs of high school
, teh love for sci
- fi adn thirst for gore shared by thsi same age group
, etc
. nothing isnt taken seriously
. it
' s almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless
,
but withthe its sly
and futuristic approach
, it
' s not as recognizably so
. it
' s a spoof so subtle thyat many won
' t recognize the spoofery
. if you deem this as sci
- fi
/ action
, yuo
' re wrong
. it
' s sci
- fi
/ action
/ comedy
, wtih hte comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2
. starship troopers jsut may be onthe the road to cult status as well
. gore isnt a factor heavily brang up in reviews ofthe tihs film
, bu tghe gore
, too
, is meant to be cheesy
. yes
, it
' s graphic
,
but it
' s alsot brutally phony
,
and that
' s what mkaes it such great fun to watch
. not sicne thge old
" mr
. bill
" skits on
" saterday night live
" hasnt torture anbd mutilation beeen such a joy to watch
. peple weere laughing outloud loud every time a body was severed inaddition half or a head was viciously decapitated
. perhasp it brings back fond memories of tje severities we inflicted apon our sisters
' barbie dolls as young childen
. iwth tyhe actors resembling ken adn barbie so closley
, it
' s a good chance this isnt tje case
, whether we
' re fully aware ofthe it or nto
. starship troopers has it
' s slow parts
,
but it
' s truley an targetted to your tipical sci
- fi
/ acation flick or lame juvenile comedy
. asside ffrom teh intentionally cheesy gore
, yhe spacial effects are quite astounding
. wehn the spaceship passes a meteor
, it
' s qutie an awsome spectacle
, visually crisp annd captivating
. if yuo
' re looking fo brainless fun
, thsi is the epitome ofthe your search
. a beautiful cast
, awesome speical effects
, fast
- paced action
, campy acting
, anbd a whole lot ofthe gore
. this is brainless heaven
. just remember nto tothe think
.
