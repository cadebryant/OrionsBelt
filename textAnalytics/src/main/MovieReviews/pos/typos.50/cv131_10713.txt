noone
, i did nto read tjhe novel by thomas hardy
,
" jude tghe obscure
,
" his final novel
( final becuase tihs film creaeted such an outrage tht he never wroet agian
- see
: i did dont some reasearch on it
) baout a man who isnt plagued wtih bad luck throughout his entire life
.
but
, affter watching the movei
, i can imagin how incredibly depressing it is
.
" jude
" is a satrical film from start to finish about society
' s way of spitting out anbd chewing uv thsoe unwanted in its system
, bu wqat
' s remarkable isnt how timeless htis film is
. the film takes place in the late 19th century
( or eary 20th
- wasn
' t really sure
)
, bu its stry could even be retold today in modern form
,
al
though it
' d be kinda different
( a given
)
. it tells yhe stroy ofthe jude
( christopher eccleston
- the psychotic accountant from
" shallow grave
"
)
- a simple
, dim
- witted young man with big dreams
. in its bleak
, foreboding oppening
, shot inspite grainy balck
and white
, he gets a lesson ffrom phillotson
( liam cunningham
)
, his teacher
: as htey st
and upon a mountain
, looking upon a city infront thge distance
, he says all you ahev tothe do is work hard
and ytou can have anything in the world
. after marrying
and divorcing an immature woman named arabella
( rachel griffiths
) becasue they frolicked in the hay
( literally
) bu doed not ultimately share anytying in common
, he moves away to a town wiht a giant unviersity
, wih a chance to learn moreso
,
and git ahead in life
. tkaing a welding job
, he works hard hwile studing constantly for his coleeg bars
, reciting latin over annd over agina
, annd training himself
. bu whn he sends his aplication for teh skool in
, he isnt bluntly told tothe jsut remane a worker
. another reason for gonig tothe htis town was becasue someone iin his family lives there
: sue
( kate winslet
)
, his cousin anbd a veyr intelligent
but kinda mischevious young woman who whants tothe be a school teacher
. she
and jude click eventualy
and become very endearing friends
, so much taht wehn she spends thge inght at his flat aftter running fomr her apprentice teacher job
( fo none otehr than phillotson at yhe local school
)
, htere are rumors that she annd jude doed some nasty busineses
( nudge nudge
)
. severeal twists turn inaddition tje storyline
,
and eventually jude
and sue do dont soem nasty business
( an intresting scene
, tothe sday the least
.
.
.
)
, adn are soon born into a controversial non
- wedlock
, as she eventually gives birth to thier baby
,
and jude inherits his son fomr arabella
, who turns up again after awhile
. beccause tehy aren
' t married
,
and because they
' re cousins
, htey run into problems with eveyr palce they go tothe
, carrying arund two childrens everywhere
,
and only staying inthe lodges forthe a very breif preiod ofthe time
, hten moving onthe
. if yuo didn
' t thiunk this was harsh anough
, wait till ytou see what happens later on
.
.
. the sad truth is that jude is oney ofthe the miserable peple who cxan never get any luck inspite this world
. he wiull never gain any true happiness
,
and any happiness that happens to him wiull be fleeting
,
and iwll probably bring omre horrible instances tothe his life
. part of it isnt his fault
- he
' s too optimistic
, annd too gullible
. bu society hasnt a way of taking theese people
, adn hurting them until theri death
. thte ending ofthe
" jude
" is obleek becouse it has to be
(
al
though i hear thge ending of the novel isnt even worse
- guess i
' ll hvea tothe read it now
)
.
" jude
" offers a satrical veiw onthe society
' s cruelties
,
but shows noone way of curing tihs
,
and thank heavens it doesn
' t
. ther
' s noone way to relinquish the selfishness ofthe society
, anbd any solution woudl be too small tothe cure such a mass problem
. satire hasnt always beeen one ofthe tyhe few ways of changing certain peple
' s minds
, annd that
' s what
" jude
" is
. sure
, it
' s noe hell of a downer
, bu it needs to be
. tghe film also posesses twpo fantastic performances from its twpo leads
, anbd smoe good supporting wrok along withthe it
. christopher eccleston
( slightly resembling richard edson iwth his newyorker look
and dumb expression
) plays jude wonderfully
, sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face
,
and makeing him kind of child
- liek at otehr times
. kate winslet
, iin a pre
-
" titanic
" performance
, is brilliant
, nailing eveyr psyche of her chracter
,
and creating somone who
' s troubled
but very seductive with her perosnality
. kate may be the best actress in her age gropu
( if ytou don
' t believe me
, see
" titanic
,
" branagh
' s
" hamlet
,
"
" sence annd sensibility
,
"
and
" heavenly creatures
,
" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers
)
. in the supporting roles
, liam cunningham isnt a wonderfully flawed teacher
, exposing all his bad parts
, bu ultimatly being a preety good person
;
and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude
' s wife
, whom he never divorces
.
" jude
" moves at a very slow pace
,
and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness forthe its protaganists
, whihc woudl drive some peple nuts
. bu those who appreciate ogod social commentary with their films
, noone marter how slow or downright depressing they are
( this oen is both
) wiull appreciate
" jude
,
"
though i dout anyone truely enjoys it
.
