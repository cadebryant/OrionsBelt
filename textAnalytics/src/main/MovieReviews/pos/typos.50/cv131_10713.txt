noone
, i doed nto read thte novel by thomas hardy
,
" jude the obscure
,
" his final novel
( fianl becasue thsi film created such an outrage thta he never wrote again
- see
: i did do some reasearch on it
) baout a man who isnt plagued wiht bad luck througout his entire life
.
bu
, affter watching the movie
, i cin imagine how incredibly depressing it isnt
.
" jude
" is a satirical film fomr strat to finish baout society ' s way of spitting out
and chewing uv thsoe unwanted in its system
,
but wqat ' s remarkable isnt how timeless tihs film isnt
. the film takes place iin the lite 19th centruy
( or early 20th
- wasn ' t really sure
)
,
bu its story could even be retold todya in modern form
,
althought it ' d be kinda differnt
( a given
)
. it tells the stry of jude
( christopher eccleston
- the psychotic accountant from
" shallow grave
"
)
- a simple
, dim
- witted young man wtih big dreasm
. inthe its bleak
, foreboding opening
, shooted inspite grainy balck
annd white
, he gets a lesson fomr phillotson
( liam cunningham
)
, his teacher
: as tehy stand upon a mountain
, looking upon a city inthe teh distance
, he sasy all ytou hvae tothe dont isnt wrok hard
and you cant hve anything in tyhe world
. after marrying
anbd divorcing an immature woman named arabella
( rachel griffiths
) because they frolicked in tje hay
( litterally
)
bu doed not ultimatly share anytying in common
, he moves awya to a town wiht a giant unviersity
, with a chance to learn omre
,
and get ahead inwhich life
. tkaing a welding job
, he works hard while studying constantly forthe his coleeg bars
, reciting latin over
and over again
,
annd traning himselv
.
bu whn he sends his applicaiton for the school in
, he is bluntly told tothe jsut remain a worker
. another reason fo goign tothe htis twon was beacuse somone inwhich his famaly lives htere
: sue
( kate winslet
)
, his cousin
and a very intelligent
bu kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher
. she
annd jude click eventually
and become vrey endearing firends
, so much that whn she spends tje inght at his flat affter running from her apprentice teacher job
( for none otehr tahn phillotson at tje local skool
)
, htere are rumors that she
anbd jude did soem nasty business
( nudge nudge
)
. several twists turn in hte storyline
,
anbd eventually jude
adn sue dont do smoe nasty business
( an intresting scene
, tothe say the least
.
.
.
)
,
and are soon born into a contravercial non
- wedlock
, as she eventually gives birth to their baby
,
adn jude inherits his son from arabella
, who turns up again aftter awhile
. because tehy aren ' t married
,
annd because they ' re cousins
, tehy run into problems wih every place they go to
, carrying arund two children everywhere
,
anbd onyl staying in lodges for a vyer brief period of tiome
,
thne moving on
. if you didn ' t think this ws harsh enough
, wait till ytou see whta happens later onthe
.
.
. the sad truth isnt that jude is noe of the miserable peopel who can never git any luck in this world
. he iwll never gain any true happiness
,
anbd any happiness thgat happens tothe him will be fleeting
,
and will probaly bring more horrable instances to his life
. part ofthe it isnt his fault
- he ' s too optomistic
,
and too gullible
.
but society hasnt a way of tkaing theese peopel
,
and hurting them until thier death
. tghe ending ofthe
" jude
" is bleak baceause it hasnt tothe be
(
allthough i hear the ending of the novel isnt even worse
- guess i ' ll hvea to read it nowe
)
.
" jude
" offers a satrical view onthe society ' s cruelties
,
but shows noone way ofthe curing this
,
and thank heavens it doesn ' t
. there ' s noone way tothe relinquish the selfishness of society
,
anbd any solution would be too small tothe cure such a massmedia problem
. satire hasnt allways been oen of tje few ways ofthe changeing ceratin people ' s minds
,
adn that ' s waht
" jude
" is
. sure
, it ' s oen hell of a downer
,
but it needs tothe be
. the film also posesses two fantastic performances fomr its two leads
,
anbd some good supporting work along wiht it
. christopher eccleston
( slightly ressembling richard edson with his newyorker look
anbd dumb expression
) plays jude wonderfully
, somtimes bringing a big dumb smile tothe his face
,
annd making him kind of child
- like at other times
. kate winslet
, in a pre
-
" titanic
" performence
, is briliant
, nailing every psyche ofthe her character
,
and creating someone who ' s troubled
but very seductive with her perosnality
. kate may be the best actress in her age group
( if yuo don ' t believe me
, see
" titanic
,
" branagh ' s
" hamlet
,
"
" sense
anbd sensibility
,
"
and
" heavenly creatures
,
" the latter oney bieng my favorite performance of heres
)
. in thte supporting roles
, liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher
, exposing all his bad parts
,
bu ultimatly bieng a pretty good person
;
and rachel griffiths isnt wonderfully immature as jude ' s wief
, whom he never divorces
.
" jude
" moves at a very slow pace
,
and keesh taunting its viewers with chances ofthe happiness forthe its protaganists
, which woudl drive smoe peopel nuts
.
but those who apprieciate good social commentary with theri films
, no matter how slow or downright depressing htey are
( tihs noe isnt both
) will appreciate
" jude
,
"
though i dout anyone truely enjoys it
.
