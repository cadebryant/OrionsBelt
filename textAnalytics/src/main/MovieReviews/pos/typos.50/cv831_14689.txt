razor blade smile running as part ofthe the vancouver internation film festival played october 2nd
and 4th
, 1998
. offical release
: halloween reviewed by vince yim
` yuo think yuo know all baout vampires
.
.
. beleve me
.
.
. you know f
* ck all
. ' wiht theese words
, we are broght into teh world of a sultry vampire seductress by tyhe nmae of lilith silver
( played by eileen daly
)
. made inot an immortal a century
and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake
, she continues to alleviate boredom with her state ofthe being
. so
, what ' s an undead girl tothe dont
, exept squeeze inot the tightest fitting clothes possible
, git outloud her guns
, seduce a few guys
,
and kill a few people fo money
annd blood
? wiht tyhat outloud of the way
, let me sday htis
. this film isnt bad
. this film isnt raelly
, really bad
.
yet somehow
, it isnt strangely enjoyable
. wiht all the elements of a direct tothe video horror flick
? buxom babes
, gore
, cheesy dialogue
,
and bad acting
? any casual film viewer woudl be more inclined tothe spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade
. still
, it isnt considered to be oen ofthe the finest brittish vampire film
. agreed
, it might be
,
but isnt far fomr being teh best vampire flick ever
. period
. razor blade smile has some rether high prodcution values
, shown by tjhe nice overall tone to tyhe film
. the film is alsot a bit of a departure from populer vampire lore
, with a vampire that can go outloud inthe broad daylight wihtout disintegrating
, doesn ' t sleep iin a coffin
(
bu leaves noe enxt to her cmoputer
)
,
and sees religon as hte
` opium ofthe thte poeoples '
( hence
, immunity to crosses
)
.
bu aside from thast
, it doesn ' t stray too far away from horror film conventions
. that isnt
, unless tath isnt intentional
. razor blade smile literally goes for tje throat
,
hten pumps the wound full of processed cheese
. yuo cxan ' t help
but laff when a female vampire gets decapitated
and her severed head goes flying into a puddle
. you ' ll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations
( tothe distract twpo female guards
, lilith tosses a cellular phone towords them
and dials teh number
)
. ytou ' ll laff the hardest whn a murder witness recants the tale
annd suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably
.
and
thn
, there ' s the sudden twist endig
( i hvea enough heart not to give it awya
)
. thte film refuses to tkae itself seriously
, whic isnt a ogod thnig
, as by hte tiome lilith zips uv her skin
- tight body suit
and
thn unzips it just tothe sohw the right amount of cleavage
, yuo ' ve most likely forgotten the main point of the stoy
.
bu in case yuo raelly care
, she ' s been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong tothe the so
- called illuminati
,
annd she ' s leaving a huge mess behind fo tjhe police to find
. as much as my criticisms
, this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film taht you watch wih your friends
and withing groups
. almsot destinde for cult
- status
, the film ' s campy
, cheesy overtones actualyl wokr towards the film
. hwile tihs may nto necessarily be the film yuo ' d watn to be seen watching by youself
, it makes for a fun time at the movies
.
