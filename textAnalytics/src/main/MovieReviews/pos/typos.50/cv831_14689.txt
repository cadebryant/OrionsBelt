, 1998
. official realease
: halloween reviewed by vince yim
` you think you nkow all baout vampires
.
.
. believe me
.
.
. ytou knwo f
* ck all
.
' with theese words
, we are brought into yhe world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name ofthe lilith silver
( played by eileen daly
)
. made into an immortal a century adn a half ago by the sinister ethan blake
, she continues tothe alleviate boredom with her state ofthe being
. so
, what
' s an undead girl to do
, except squeeze inot the tightest fitting clothes possable
, get out her guns
, seduce a fewd guys
, annd kill a few peple for omney adn blood
? with that out of tghe way
, let me sday this
. this film is bad
. this film isnt relaly
, really bad
. yot somehow
, it isnt strangely enjoyable
. witht all thte elements of a direct to video horror flick
? buxom babes
, gore
, cheesy dialogue
, anbd bad acting
? any casual film viewer owudl be mroe inclined tothe spend their money onthe renting innocent blood or going to see blade
. still
, it isnt consdidered tothe be oen ofthe tjhe finest british vampire film
. agreed
, it might be
,
but isnt far fomr bieng hte best vampire flick ever
. period
. razor blade smile has some rather high prodcution values
, shown by the nice overall tone tothe thte film
. the film is allso a bit of a departure fomr populare vampire lore
, with a vampire that can go out inspite broad daylight without disintegrating
, doesn
' t sleep in a coffin
(
but leaves oney enxt to her computer
)
, adn sees religion as thte
` opium of the peoples
'
( hence
, immunity to crosses
)
. bu asside fomr that
, it doesn
' t stray too far awya fomr horror film conventions
. that isnt
, unless that is intentional
. razor blade smile litterally goes for the throat
, thn pumps teh wound full of processed cheese
. you can
' t help
but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated
and her severed head goes flying into a puddle
. you
' ll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations
( to distract twpo female guards
, lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them
and dials yhe number
)
. you
' ll laff teh hardest when a muder wittness recants tyhe tale
and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably
. adn
then
, there
' s tghe sudden twist ending
( i have anough heart not tothe give it awya
)
. the film refuses tothe tkae itself seriously
, which isnt a good thign
, as by the tiome lilith zips uv her skin
- tight body suit annd thn unzips it jsut tothe sohw the right amount of cleavage
, yuo
' ve most likely forgotten tjhe main point of the stroy
. bu inaddition case yuo really care
, she
' s been assigned tothe kill a bunch ofthe peopel who belong to thge so
- called illuminati
, anbd she
' s leaving a huge mess behind fo hte police to fidn
. as much as my criticisms
, htis movie works best as a gilty pleasure or as a film thyat yuo watch with your friends anbd withing groups
. almost destined forthe cult
- status
, tghe film
' s campy
, cheesy overtones actually owrk towords the film
. hwile htis may not neccessarily be the film yuo
' d whant tothe be seen watching by youself
, it mkaes for a funn time at thte movies
.
