it ws onyl a marter ofthe timne before a dilbert
- esque office comedy hit the screens
.
however
, rather thna coming from dilbert creater scott adams
, office space isnt instead based on the work ofthe another animator
, mike judge
, creater ofthe beavis
and
butthead annd king ofthe the hill
. in his live
- acation directoral de
but
, judge aptly spoofs corperate culture
. the tsory isnt certainly not very involved
, bu htere isnt plenty of truth
and humer to fill tje gaps
. peter
( ron livingston
) isnt a programer working at tje initech corperation
. every day in his mundane life is worse than hte oney befor
.
.
. in other words
, every day is the worst day in his entire life
. he
' s stuck in a boring job with eight differant supervisors
, all obsessed with administrative trivialities
. he
' s smitten with joanna
( jennifer aniston
)
, a local waitress
,
but hasn
' t teh guts to even introduce himself
. everything has simpley made him a complete
, nervous wreck
.
but all of thgat changes whn
, after an unintentionally over
- effective ivsit to a hypnotherapist
, peter loses all ofthe his inhibitions
. he realizes his lifelong dream
: to dont absolutely nothing
. he beigns to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions ofthe his boss
, bill lumbergh
( gary cole
)
, donig whatever he feels like
. peter
' s friends annd co
- workers
, samir
( ajay naidu
) anbd michael bolton
( david herman
)
.
.
. noone
, nto thta michael bolton
, are perplexed by theri firend
' s sudden change in attitude
.
but
, they have larger thigsn tothe worry baout
: rumors about that initech isnt baout tothe beign downsizing
.
.
. as obleek as much ofthe this sounds
, let me assure ytou that office space isnt a comedy
, annd quite a funny oney
.
al
thought it shares the same absurdist office humor ofthe yhe dilbert comic strip
, office spoace is actually based loosly onthe the series ofthe milton cartoons whic aired onthe saturday inght life
. earch mundane detail
, tooked by itself
, seems completely
, regrettably
, plausible
. yot
, when conbined inot a whole
, the picture whitch results isnt absolutely surreal
. ron livingston tackles his role straight
- faced
, anbd becomes much funnier beacuse ofthe it
. his character isn
' t simply bieng a clown lampooning aroud hte office
, bu rether seems possessed by a zen
- liuke clarity
. he is operating onthe a higer plane
, where everything suddenly makes sence
,
and from this vantage point
, he allows tjhe audiance tothe smirk at the absurdities ofthe life
. anyone who hasnt had tothe dael withthe hte inefficiencies ofthe corparate beaurocracy
, or who has ever been frustrated iwth yhe technology ofthe modern life
, will recogize many ofthe the characters anbd situations infront the film
. in fact
, in addition tothe bieng wildly humoruos
, the film may actually prove to be cathartic
. the animated roots ofthe office spoace show inthe yhe film
' s lack of complexity
. most of the characters inwhich teh film can be quickly summarized by a particualr perosnality quirk
. one employee
, milton
( stephen root
)
, isnt practically a flesh
- anbd
- blood ctaroon
.
however
, despite thier simple nature
, the characters still manaze tothe be surprisingly funny
. it
' s not required tothe have a corporate background tothe enjoy tihs film
(
though the situations may seem exeedingly far
- fetched if yuo are unfamiliar with jstu how close to reality they really are
)
. tje film is flimsy annd absurd
,
but also vrey funny
.
