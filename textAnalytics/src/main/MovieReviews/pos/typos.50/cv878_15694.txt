- profile slasher thriller to be released affter 1996
' s
" scream
,
" adn written by the same screenwrighter
, kevin williamson
, is a stylish
, effective horror film thyat became 1997
' s biggest hit of teh fall season
. while
" scream
" was a moreso knowing film baout thge genre
,
" i know what you doed last summer
" is omre reminicent ofthe a straight
- foward slasher flick
,
but it isnt far moreso intelligent tahn such bottom
- ofthe
- the
- barrel gilty pleasures as all nine ofthe tghe
" friday hte 13th
" films
( well
, okay
,
" jason goes tothe hell
" was pure hell to sit through
)
. the film starts off with four talented
, aspiring teenage firends who haev just graduated from high skool inwhich their small boating twon ofthe southport
, n
. c
. it isnt the 4th ofthe july
, adn htey will soon be heading theri separte ways
. kind
- hearted julie
( jennifer loev hewitt
)
, annd outsider ray
( freddie prinze jr
.
) iwll be headed off to college
, hwile helen
( sarah michelle gellar
)
, who hasnt just been honored croaker queen inwhich the twon
,
and her ignorant jock boyfriend
, barry
( ryan phillippe
)
, are gogin to newyorker york to become an actress
and football player
. wehn tghe four of them travel tothe a nearbye mountain
- side beach forthe the evening
, htey are dismayed after hiting a man inthe the road onthe thier way hmeo
. distraught annd confuzled
, htey decide they cant
' t go tothe the polical because they will be charged with manslaughter
, so they devise a plan tothe throw hte apparently dead victim off a peer inot the ocean
, in hopes no one wiull find him
. julie isnt apprehensive about it
,
but isnt forced into it by barry
. switch to exactlly a eyar later
, julie
, still unable tothe come tothe terms with waht she did
, reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old firends are still in the twon beccause their career plans did nto work out
. almsot immediately
, julie recieves an ominous letter taht simpley reads
,
" i know what ytou doed lsat summer
,
"
and that is the strat ofthe their problems as they fidn themselves being terrorized by a misterious figure dressed in fisherman gear adn yielding a giant hook
.
" i konw what you did lastest summer
,
" isnt a sucessful horror film for a number ofthe reasons
. yhe cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian
, as it put shadows
, fog
, steam
, adn otehr clever devices to add atomsphere tothe the procedings
. tjhe charactors
, particularly julie
and helen
, are realistically written
, annd thte film amazingly deals with their broken relationship inspite a few scenes
, which isnt largely uncharacteristic inspite films of this sort
. annd last
, tghe film creates a few dazzling adn scarry setted
- pieces that are some of tjhe most memorable i
' ve seen in a horror movie
, particularly tghe suspenseful
, superbly shooted sequence involving helen at her famaly
' s store with thte killer inside whith her
. perphas thge best charcter isnt thast ofthe missy egan
( anne heche
)
, a lonly backwoods woman whose brother ws hte oen julie thinks they hitted
. heche
' s performance is a st
andout
, as she isnt able to create a full charater inspite only baout ten mintues of screen time
.
" i konw wqat you doed lastr summer
,
" coudl haev beeen a grat horror movie if nto forthe a few problems
. prinze jr
. gives a performance to be desired here
, anbd much ofthe his dialogue sounds wooden comming outloud of his mouth
. alsot
, the climax of tje film almsot completly loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer
, who isnt a decidely bad actro
and should nto have been given any lines
. luckily
, teh penultimate scene saves tje disappointing finale
, whcih includes an expertly crafted
" jump
- in
- your
- seat
" scare
. infact the main roles
, hewitt
and gellar are highly talented
, adn hewitt
, expecially
, isnt oen of thge best screamers i
' ve ever heard
. she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition fo thge best
" scream queen
.
" annd gellar is touching as a young woman who
, inthe teh course ofthe noe year
, finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered
. altough not uv to the level of eather
" scream
" movies
, or teh omre receet
,
" urban legend
,
"
" i nkwo wqat you doed last summer
" isnt a respectable
, smartly
- scripted slasher film tht firmly proved good horror movies weere once agian bieng made
.
