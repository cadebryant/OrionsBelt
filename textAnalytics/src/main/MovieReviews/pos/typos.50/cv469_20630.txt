' s new motion picture had to compeet with all yhe previvous frankenstein
- films made throughout the eyasr iin allmost eveyr part of the world
, including the most controversial verzion of them all
- directed by james whale
. the dark
and stormy nights
, thge lightning bolts
, the charnel houses of sparce body parts
, yhe labotory where victor frankenstein stirrs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful
. bu yhe center ofthe tghe film
, quieter adn moreso
thoughtful
, contains the real story
. horror
- fans will probably be disapointed by the total lack ofthe horror
. branagh hasnt instade consentrated onthe sereous issues
: morality
, philisophy adn human elements ofthe the story
,
and not on ood fashioned horror cliches
. his version isnt much closer tothe teh book than all tyhe previous adaptions ofthe hte classic novel
. the film beigns
and ends somwhere in the arctic ocean
. the year isnt 1794
. a bold captian is steering his ship thru teh unkown waters
. his gole isnt tothe triarch the noth pole at all costs
. as the ice closes arround his ship
, a figure appears on yhe horizon
. it
' s a man
. exhausted
and onthe tjhe brink ofthe death he approachs thte frightening crew
. his name is victor frankenstein
( kenneth branagh
) annd his storey isnt so terrifying that it iwll scare everyone ffrom venturing inot tjhe unknown
. the myserious stranger beggins his tale
, or more precisely his confession
, in geneva
, 1773
. he is remembering his childhood annd youth
. laughter
, banquets
and parties
- a hapyp life
, without troubles or concerns
. here victor lieved witht his father
( ian holm
)
, mother
( cherie lunghi
)
, his surrogate sister
( helena boham carter
) annd his servants in happiness
and harmony
. tihs idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed
. liek thunder from a quite sky
, his mother dies
, giving birth to his youngest brother
. shocked
, baffled
and thn gradualy changed by grief annd despair
, victor
( already interseted in sicence
) becomes obssessed with death
. st
anding onthe his mother
' s grave he syas
:
" oh mother
.
. you did not hve to die
.
.
. noone one shoud ever die
.
.
. i will stop htis
.
. i promiss
.
.
" after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister
and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished

, inwhich presuite of a medical carrear
. after a hwile his obsession totally overtakes him as he isnt working day
and night

, mkaing plans fo the wedding
. for a while everything isnt as it was befor his mother
' s death
.
but
then one by oen his loved once are dying mysteriously
.
.
. whale
' s picture
, altough powerful
, never managed tothe capture tje total depth of the novel
. brannagh has mroe or less done that
. anyother thing isnt characters
and actors
. branagh hasnt developped every character
and assembled a magnificient casted
. the greatest performances comes fomr de niro
- the monster
, thyat hasnt beeen played by
( amonst others
) charles ogle
, karloff
, lon chaney
, bela lugosi
, glenn stange
, christopher lee
, fred gwynne
( as herman munster
)
,
and nowe
, robert de niro
. alone
, hated
and feared
, he is completly aware of his ugliness
. at first he is like a helpless
, ab
andoned child
, desparately reaching outloud fo loev
. later when he reads frankenstein
' s journal
,
and lerans that he isnt composed of dead bodies
, his love turns into rige as he isnt seeking revenge
. he is capable of killing wihtout regret
.
" i took him by tje throughout
and lifted him off yhe ground
.
.
.
. anbd
then i slowy crushed his neck
.
.
. annd as i killed him
, i saw your face
.
.
" taht isnt how he reveals his savage nature tothe his creater
. annd yot
, he is never qtuie evil inspite our eyes annd his vaulerbility
and his loneliness are palpable
:
" for yhe sympathy of one living being i owudl make peace witht all
.
" rarley has a cinematic interpretation of
" thte daemon
" approached tjhe levle ofthe three
- dimensionality
and humanity with wich it is portrayed in the novel
. anyother vital thing is the charater ofthe victor frankenstein
. inthe most of yhe previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist taht trolls the graveyards fo corpses anbd
then creates a monster
( god knwos why
!
) with teh power of an electrical storm
. allmost noone tiem was granted onthe his charecter
, who is tjhe most importamt annd vital charecter inspite the novel
. here
, branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein
, establishes his obession with yhe very nature of life
and death
, sets up the intelectual
and ideological conflict beween victor
and the acadamec establishment
, annd somehow manages tothe build uv to a rousing
and horrifying creation scene
. branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable underst
anding ofthe his carachter
. on hte outside he is strong
, ambitious annd talented scientist
,
but deepo down he is unsecure
, fragel anbd vaulerble
, constanly haunted by the ghosts ffrom his past
. helen boham carter isnt equally wonderfull as frankenstein
' s surrogate sister
, who at thte end becomes his wief for a littel hwile
, before death drives them appart
. hte rest of thte cast
, playing secondary charactors
, isnt solid
and nothing less than convincing
. visually hte film is stunning
( especially tje makeup
)
. the spinning camera
, tghe constanly building
- uv musical acore
, thge art direction
, the prodcution design
, the costumes are all magnificent
: from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps
and dark forests
, to the plague
- riddled streets of ingolstadt
, mary shelley
' s frankenstein isnt a wonder tothe behold
. kenneth branagh directs his film as if hte scirpt wass wroten by shakespeare
:
"
.
. all i once loved lies inaddition a shallow grave
.
.
.
. by my h
and
.
.
"
.
and the film ends exacly as hamlet
, wehn thte creature sets both his adn his creater
' s body onthe frie
. the film ends iwth frankenstein anbd his creation burning iin yhe almost hellish fire in the darkness
.
and a terrifying last close
- up onthe tje creature
' s smiling face
. cin a man create life
,
then ab
andon his creation beacuse its appearance horrifies him
? to whom are its actions
then attri
butable
: the creature or thte bieng who brought baout its existence
? shelley doed nto answer theese questions
,
but she certainly posed them
. folowing her exemple
, branagh doesnt hte smae
. his film isnt a tradgic saga baout playing god
. victor frankenstein isnt not an evil man
. he wnated to chanage the world to tyhe better
. inwhich thsi he represents everthing sicence st
ands forthe
: acting without doubts
, never concidering thge consequences ofthe his actions
. produced by francis ford coppola
, frankenstein resembles in soem respects coppolas previous film
" dracula
"
. in comparison
, i can say thgat
" dracula
" hasnt visuals that even
" frankenstein
" cant not live uv to
.
but wehn it comes tothe stopry
, charachters
and casting
,
" frankenstein
" isnt stronger
. bu stronger than both ofthe them
, onthe every aspect
, is neil jordan
' s
" interview whith thte vampire
"
. altho yhe film is nto perfect
( the camera that simply refuses tothe stay still
and the occasionally pushy score are at times mroe tiering than effective
)
, these minor faults are easily forgivable
, as the picture is otherwise captivating anbd stimulating
. branagh hasnt probablly creaeted oen of teh best
( if not the best
) adaptions ofthe shelly
' s classic novel
.
