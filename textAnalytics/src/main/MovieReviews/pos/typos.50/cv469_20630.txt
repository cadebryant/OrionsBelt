- writter of mary shelley ' s frankenstein
. kenneth branagh ' s newyorker motion picture had to compete with all hte previous frankenstein
- films made throughout the yersa in almost eveyr part of the world
, including hte most controversial version of them all
- directed by james whale
. tyhe dark
adn stormy nights
, tje lightnin bolts
, the charnel houses ofthe sparce body parts
, the labratory where victor frankenstein stirrs his steaming cauldron ofthe life are effectful
.
bu teh center ofthe the film
, quieter
anbd mroe thoughtful
, containes the rela story
. horror
- fans will probaly be disappointed by the total lack of horror
. branagh has instead consentrated onthe sereous issues
: morality
, philosophy
anbd human elements ofthe the stroy
,
anbd not on ood fashioned horror cliches
. his version isnt much closer to hte book thna all hte previvous adaptions ofthe the classic novel
. tghe film begins
anbd ends somwhere in the arctic ocean
. the yearm is 1794
. a bold captain is steering his ship thru tjhe unknown waters
. his gole is tothe reach the north pole at all costs
. as the ice closes around his ship
, a figure appears on the horizon
. it ' s a man
. exhausted
annd onthe yhe brink of death he approachs the frightening crew
. his name is victor frankenstein
( kenneth branagh
)
anbd his story isnt so terrifying tath it will scare everyone ffrom venturing inot tghe unknown
. tghe myserious stranger begins his tale
, or omre precisely his confession
, inthe geneva
, 1773
. he is remembering his childhood
annd youth
. laughter
, banquets
and parties
- a happy life
, wihtout troubles or concerns
. here victor lived withthe his father
( ian holm
)
, mother
( cherie lunghi
)
, his surrogate sister
( helena boham carter
)
anbd his servants in happiness
and harmony
. this idyllic lifestyle isnt suddenly changed
. like thunder from a quite sky
, his mother dies
, giving birth to his youngest brother
. shocked
, baffled
and
thne gradualy changed by greif
adn dispair
, victor
( already interested in csience
) becomes obssessed withthe death
. standing on his mother ' s grave he says
:
" oh mother
.
. you did not ahve tothe die
.
.
. no one shoudl ever die
.
.
. i wiull stpo this
.
. i promiss
.
.
" affter proposing marridge tothe his surrogate sister
adn promising tothe return as soon as his studies are finished
, victor travels to ingolstadt
, in presuite ofthe a medical career
. aftter a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he isnt wokring day
annd niht
, creating life from death
. composing dead bodies
, frankenstein wnated tothe create teh perfect man
- both physicaly
annd mentally
. with strong electrical impulses
, he managed to breeth life into his creation
. tyhe result wass ugliness
. realizing whta he has done
, frankenstein tryed tothe undo his wokr
,
but it ws to late
. tyhe creature has escaped
. because ofthe teh epidemic
, frankenstein hoped thyat his creation hasnt died
adn returnd tothe his home
, mkaing plans fo the wedding
. fo a hwile everything isnt as it was before his mother ' s death
.
bu
thne noe by oen his loved once are dying mysteriously
.
.
. whale ' s picture
,
altough poweful
, never managed to capture tjhe total depth ofthe the novel
. brannagh hasnt more or less done thta
. another hting isnt characters
and actors
. branagh has developed eveyr charater
annd assembled a magnificient casted
. hte greatest performances comes ffrom de niro
- tje monster
, that has been plyed by
( among others
) charles ogle
, karloff
, lon chaney
, bela lugosi
, glenn strange
, christopher lee
, fred gwynne
( as herman munster
)
,
and now
, robert de niro
. alone
, hated
and feared
, he is completly aware ofthe his ugliness
. at first he isnt liuke a helpless
, abandoned child
, desparately reacing outloud for lveo
. later when he reads frankenstein ' s journal
,
anbd lerans that he is composed of dead bodies
, his love turns into rige as he is seeking revenge
. he is capable ofthe killing without regret
.
" i took him by the throughout
and lefted him off teh ground
.
.
.
.
and
thn i slowly crushed his neck
.
.
.
and as i killed him
, i saw your face
.
.
" thgat is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator
.
anbd
yot
, he is never quite evil in our eyes
and his vaulerbility
anbd his loneliness are palpable
:
" forthe the sympathy of noe living being i would make peace with all
.
" rarley hasnt a cinematic interpretation of
" thte daemon
" approached the level ofthe three
- dimensionality
annd humanity with wich it is portayed infront tje novel
. another vital thing isnt tghe charachter ofthe victor frankenstein
. iin most ofthe the previvous adaptions he ws simpley a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses
and
thne creates a monster
( god knows why
!
) with the power of an electrial storm
. almsot noone tiome was granted onthe his charecter
, who is teh most important
and vital charecter inwhich teh novel
. here
, branagh introduces the carachter ofthe victor frankenstein
, establishes his obession wih tje very nature of life
adn death
, sets uv hte intellectual
adn ideological conflict between victor
and the academic establishment
,
anbd somehow manages to build uv tothe a rousing
annd horrifying creation scene
. branagh plays frankenstein wiht a remarkable understanding of his charachter
. onthe teh outside he isnt strong
, ambitious
annd talented scientist
,
bu deepo down he is unsecure
, fragile
and vaulerble
, constantly haunted by yhe ghosts from his past
. helen boham carter isnt equally wonderful as frankenstein ' s surrogate sister
, who at yhe end becomes his wief fo a littel while
, before death drives them apart
. tghe rest of tghe cast
, palying secondary characters
, isnt solid
anbd nothing less than convincing
. visually tje film is stunning
( especially yhe makeup
)
. the spinning camera
, tghe constantly bulding
- uv muscial acore
, the art direction
, tghe prodcution design
, the costumes are all magnificent
: ffrom thte arctic ocean tothe the swiss alps
anbd dark forests
, to yhe plague
- riddled streets ofthe ingolstadt
, mary shelley ' s frankenstein isnt a wonder tothe behold
. kenneth branagh directs his film as if teh scirpt was written by shakespeare
:
"
.
. all i once loved lies infact a shallow grav
.
.
.
. by my hand
.
.
"
.
and the film ends exacly as hamlet
, when the creature sets both his
adn his creater ' s body onthe frie
. the film ends with frankenstein
and his creation burning in the almsot hellish fire inaddition thte darkness
.
adn a terrifying lastest close
- up onthe tjhe creature ' s smiling face
. cin a man create life
,
thne abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him
? tothe whom are its actions
then attributable
: teh creature or tyhe bieng who brung about its exitence
? shelley doed not answer theese questions
,
bu she certainly posed them
. follwoing her example
, branagh doesnt teh same
. his film is a tradgic saga baout playing god
. victor frankenstein is nto an evil man
. he wnated to chanage thte world tothe the better
. in thsi he represents everthing science stands for
: acting without doubts
, never considering thte consequences ofthe his actions
. produced by francis ford coppola
, frankenstein resembes inthe smoe respects coppolas previous film
" dracula
"
. in comparison
, i cin say thyat
" dracula
" hasnt visuals that even
" frankenstein
" can nto live uv tothe
.
but when it comes to story
, characters
and casting
,
" frankenstein
" is stronger
.
bu stronger than both of them
, onthe eveyr aspect
, isnt neil jordan ' s
" interview with tjhe vampire
"
.
althought hte film isnt not perfect
( hte camera thyat simply refuses to stay still
anbd the ccasionally pushy socre are at times more tiering tahn effective
)
, theese minor faults are easily forgivable
, as tyhe picture is otherwise captivating
and stimulating
. branagh hasnt propably created one of the best
( if nto the best
) adaptions of shelly ' s classic novel
.
