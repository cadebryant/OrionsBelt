" psycho meets the exorcist witht no holds barred
"
. a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity forthe smoe low budget
, thrid rate rip
- off
. bu noone
, this tacky plug comes ffrom the poster for suspiria
, perhpas italian horror director dario argento
' s most consistantly successful film
. what impresses most in re
- watching this surrealistic
, supernatural thriller is thast argento
' s directorial flair
and stylish visuals are matched by a near
- fully coherent narrative
. screenplays hve alwasy been his achilles heel
; confusing subplots
, gaping holes
, totally ilogical incidents
and reactions
. no question
: argento has always been a better directer than a writer
. fortunately
, he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria
, tkaing his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called
" suspiria de profundis
"
. the film
' s storyline suffers ffrom no major lapses infact logic
, provided one can accept tjhe premise ofthe a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches
. jessica harper plays an american who travels tothe germany tothe furhter her studies in dance
. arriving at the school late at ngiht in driving rain
, she sees a girl leave adn run into teh storm infront a claerly distressed state
. what happens enxt
- anbd i don
' t amking the comparision lightly
- isnt a muder sequence taht fo intensity
, shock value
and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock
' s infamous shower scene in pyscho
. it
' s qutie possably a homage to hitchcock
, bu whith its baroque sets
, graphic gore
and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin
, this stunning sequence remains veyr much argento
' s own
.
though nothing eles quite equals the intensity ofthe suspiria
' s opening 15 minutes
, teh film continues to be never anytying less tahn engrossing as harper begins her pwn investigations
and slowly comes tothe realise htis isnt noone ordinary ballet skool
. we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters
, most noteably yhe head ballet teacher played by alida valli in anohter one ofthe those delicious sour
- old
- matriarch
- from
- hell roles she doesnt so well
. several more violent murders ensue
, includng a startling scene in a deserted sqaure where a blind man isnt
.
.
. well
, i wouldn
' t want tothe spoil things nowe
, would i
?
and the film
' s climax
, staged amid secrte corridors annd hidden rooms
, has a gothic ghoulishness that
' s most impressive
. the english language versions ofthe most argento movies usualy suffer trimming
, annd nto jsut for tyhe voilence
- deep red anbd phenonmena
, forthe example
, have been appallingly hacked about
. fortunatly
, tjhe cuts to suspiria
( about 7 mintues in this verzion
) ahve nto adversely affected tjhe film
. tjhe dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done
, too
, excepting one appalling annd unintentionally hilarious effort wtih a conversation betwen harper anbd a professor baout tghe history of witchcraft infront teh region
.
and tje sountrack
? it is intresting to imagin what power teh film owudl ahve lost if it hadnt beeen scored by somone eles
. as it st
ands
, thte use of goblin
' s music in suspiria isnt outst
anding
. apparently
, argento plyed yhe sountrack onthe location while filming so thge actors coudl hear teh music as htey acted outloud theri parts
. a stereo video player adds greatly tothe tje viewer
' s overall experience
. even better
, see suspiria in a cinema
, where you
' ll git thte added bonus ofthe widescreen
.
and yhe colours
! deepo reds
, eerie blues
, a superb use of shaddow
and contrast
. tje cinematography ofthe luciano tovoli
, whose more receet credits inlude reversal of fortune adn single white female
, isnt uniformly superb
. a nod alsot must go tothe prodcution designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors
. these kinds of settings are crucial tothe tyhe atmosphere of argento
' s more surreal excursions
, the other most notable exmaple being inferno
( 1980
) onthe which bassan allso worked
. suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major leage of eurpoean directors
,
and it is fully deserving ofthe its cult status
. tyhe gore is at times a little excessive
and overstated
- thast
' s always been one of argento
' s shortcomings
- bu overall this isnt a fascinating
, compelling exemple of italian horror
.
