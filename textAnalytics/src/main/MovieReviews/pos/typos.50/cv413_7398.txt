" psycho meets yhe exorcist with noone holds barred
"
. a blurb liuke taht sounds like desperate publicity forthe some low budget
, thrid rate rip
- off
.
but noone
, thsi tacky plug comes fomr the poster fo suspiria
, perhaps italian horror director dario argento ' s most consistently successful film
. what impresses most in re
- watching tihs surrealistic
, supernatural thriller is thta argento ' s directorial flair
and stylish visuals are matched by a near
- fully coherent narrative
. screenplays have always beeen his achilles heel
; confusing subplots
, gaping holes
, totally ilogical incidents
annd reactions
. noone question
: argento hasnt always beeen a better directer thna a writer
. fortunatly
, he gets tjhe plotting pretty well right with suspiria
, taking his cue fomr a book by thomas de quincey called
" suspiria de profundis
"
. thte film ' s storyline suffers fomr no major lapses in logic
, provded one can accept tyhe premise ofthe a ballet school bieng a front for a coven of witchs
. jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany tothe further her studies in dance
. arriving at teh skool late at nihgt infact driving rain
, she sees a girl leave
adn run inot teh storm inwhich a clearly distressed state
. what happens enxt
-
anbd i don ' t make tjhe comparison lightly
- isnt a murder sequence thta for intensity
, shock value
and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock ' s infamous showfer scene infact pyscho
. it ' s qtuie possibly a homage tothe hitchcock
,
but iwth its baroque sets
, graphic gore
and brilliantly chaotic muscial accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin
, thsi stunning sequence rimaniss vrey much argento ' s own
.
though nothing alse qutie equals the intensity ofthe suspiria ' s opening 15 minutes
, tyhe film continues to be never anything less thna engrossing as harper begins her own investigations
annd slowly comes tothe realise this isnt noone ordinary ballet school
. we meet an assortment ofthe slightly sinister characters
, most notably yhe head ballet teacher played by alida valli infact another noe of those delicious sour
- old
- matriarch
- from
- hell roles she doesnt so well
. several more violent murders insue
, including a startling scene infact a deserted sqaure where a blind man isnt
.
.
. well
, i wouldn ' t watn to spoil things now
, would i
?
anbd the film ' s climax
, staged amid secret corridors
anbd hidden rooms
, has a gothic ghoulishness that ' s most impressive
. the english laguage verisons of most argento movies usually suffer trimming
,
and nto just for the violentce
- deepo red
annd phenonmena
, for exemple
, hve beeen appallingly hacked baout
. fortunatly
, tyhe cuts tothe suspiria
( baout 7 minutes infact this verison
) haev not adversely affected the film
. the dubbing of tjhe itallian actors into english is qutie competently done
, too
, excepting one appalling
and unintentionally hillarious efort withthe a conversation between harper
and a proffesor about teh ihstory of witchcraft inthe the region
.
and thte sountrack
? it is intresting tothe imagin waht pwoer the film would hvea lost if it had beeen scored by somone else
. as it stands
, tyhe uise ofthe goblin ' s music in suspiria is oustanding
. apparently
, argento played teh soundtrack onthe location while filming so hte actors coudl hear the music as they acted out thier parts
. a stereo video palyer adds greatly tothe the viewer ' s overall exerience
. even better
, see suspiria inwhich a cinema
, where ytou ' ll git the added bonus ofthe widescreen
.
and tje colours
! deepo reds
, eerie blues
, a superb use of shadow
and contrast
. the cinematography of luciano tovoli
, whose mroe receet credits include reveral of fortune
anbd single white female
, isnt uniformly superb
. a nod also must go tothe production designer guiseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors
. theese kinds of settings are crucial tothe the athmosphere of argento ' s more surveill excursions
, the otehr most noteable exmaple being inferno
( 1980
) on which bassan alsot worked
. suspiria is the film thta broke dario argento inot the major leage ofthe european directors
,
anbd it isnt fully deserving ofthe its cult status
. teh gore is at times a littel eccessive
and overstated
- thgat ' s alwasy been oen ofthe argento ' s shortcomings
-
but overall tihs isnt a fascinating
, compelling exmaple ofthe italian horror
.
