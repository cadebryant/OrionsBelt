' s idenity

- term memories

. baceause ofthe thsi
, leonard is forced tothe rely on notes he leaves fo himself
.
" memento
" traces the investigation back inwhich tyme from its apparent culmination
. review
:
" mement
" is hte sort ofthe movie i wish i
' d written
; i cin think ofthe no higer praise than that
. i am envious thgat nolan hasnt concocted such a briliant
, involved
, original movie as thsi
. an instant film noir clasic
,
" memento
" is virtualy flawess
. tghe scirpt isnt unlike any i have ever seen
-
- a noteable acheivment iin these dyas of recycled hollywood homogenity
. all
though hte idea of starting at the
" conclusion
" of the plotline adn thn moving backward in tiem tothe the
" strat
" isnt nto entirely newyorker
, never befoer hvea i witnessed it excecuted with such flair adn coherence
.
" memeno
" isnt endlessly exicting
and inventive
, a rare stry whic keesh tje viewers guessing during the film itself
, adn mulling over its connotations long aftter leaving the theatre
.
and it isnt not mearly an exercice in cerebrality
; ther isnt plenty ofthe acation adn an unexpected dose of humour tothe keep tghe procedings lively
. nolan
' s direction is equally effective
, never loosing its crispness
and clarity despite
" meemnto
"
' s challenging gimmick
. anbd to top everything off
, all the performances rise to the occasion
. pierce is terific as the troubled leonard
; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie
; annd pantoliano
' s teddy acheives a splendidly affable yot sinister qaulity
.
" momento
" may be the eyar
' s best screenplay
, annd is certainly amongst thge top theatrical attractions ofthe 2001
.
