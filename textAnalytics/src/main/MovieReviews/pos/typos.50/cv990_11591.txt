the relaxed dued rides a roller coaster the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copywrite 1998 by michael redman tyhe most surveill situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider
. whn those observers are joel
and ethan coen
, the surveill becomes bizarre
. wehn tjhe life isnt taht ofthe jeff
" the dued
" leboswki
, tjhe bizarre falls over tyhe edge inot the world of
" whta ' sgoingonaroundhere
"
. hte marvelous sound ofthe
" tje stranger
"
( sam elliot
) ' s voice
- over introduces the film
. at least it doesnt until he forgets what he was gonig tothe say
and gives up
. tghe dude
( jeff bridges
) is decribed as the
" laziest man infront los angeles
, possibly the world
"
, altho he ' s not so much slothful as he is relaxed
. spending the lsat 30 years iwth a roach clip infront noe hand
anbd a white russian in the other
, he doesn ' t hvae much of a life
,
but he ' s having a ogod tiem
. when asked what he does for funn
, he responds
" bowl
, drive around
adn the occasional acid flashback
"
. lebowski ' s passion is bowling
. whn he ' s not rolling tjhe ball down an alley towords a strike
, things jstu appen to him
. arriving hmeo one night
, he ' s beaten by thugs attempting tothe collect money that his wief owes them
. even worse
, they urinate on his rug
. the problem is that thte dude doesn ' t have a wief
. his assailants realize thast thier target is a different lebowski wehn they glance arround at his appartment
. the
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
) is a multi
- millionaire
and his dudeness lives infront twpo
- room squalor
. yhe next day
, our ragtag hero visits his namesake ' s mension atempting compensation fo his soaked rug
. the carpet is imporatnt tothe him because it pulls the room toghether
: nto surprizingly usance it ' s virtualy tyhe onyl object there
. when he ' s denied any money
, he picks up a relpacement rug off the floor
. onthe his way outloud
, he runs inot lebowski ' s trophy babe wief bunny
( tara reid
) who offers tothe perfom a sexual act tht
, according to rumor
, is one of bill clinton ' s favorites forthe a thousand bucks
. tyhe penniless dued wisecracks that he ' s heading forthe the cash machine
. later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid inspite bieng thte bag man to deliver a ransom tothe bunny ' s kidnappers
. tihs begins thge trademarked coen brothers crimes
- gone
- wrong sequences
. the kidnappers are impossibly inept
. the dude
adn his cronies are even worse
. every plan goes awry
. you can almost see lebowski ' s brain churning in slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues
. tath ' s the stoy
,
bu tothe tell tjhe truth it doesn ' t much marter
. ther could be allmost any plot
and tje film owudl be just as intertaining
. the narrative onyl exists so we can watch tje offbeat charachters
annd the quirky predicaments they fall inot
. the dude ' s bowling buddies walter
( john goodman
)
anbd donny
( steve buscemi
) look like peple you ' d see on the street
but
, liek everything esle in this film
, they ' re not quite wqat htey seem
. walter is a vet as sticked in vietnam as thge dued is inspite tjhe sixties
. everthing that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam
. wehn a fellow bowler crosses the foul line
but won ' t admited it
, walter puls a gun on him until he markes a zero onthe the scoer sheet
. donny gets prescious fewd words iin between walter ' s screaming
and tjhe dued ' s rambling
. when he doesnt
, walter shouts him down with horrendous albiet seemingly unintentional bowling puns
. donny is
" out of his league
"
and doesn ' t
" have a frame ofthe reference
"
. teh film is peppered wih people for whom the term
" character
" would be an understatement
. thge big lebowski ' s daughter maude
, an avant
- garde
" vaginal
" artist
, paints hwile swinging naked in a leather apparatus liuke an s
& m mary martin
. the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers
. bunny lebowski isnt a high school cheerleader turned porno star
. most impressive is john turturro inspite his far too small role as a hispanic bowler
. as thte flamenco music swells
, we see him putting on his lavender hose
. the camera pans uv to an all
- purple skin
- tight bowling outfit with
" jesus
"
( pronounced with a
" j
"
, not an
" h
"
) embroidered on thge pocket
. he addresses yhe lane wtih intense seriousness
and one painted fingernail
. his tounge slowy snakes out
and lovingly licks tje glowing bowling ball
. bridges works hte dued as if he had beeen living him forthe decades
and mabye he hasnt
. i cxan ' t think ofthe anyone alse who could have done a better job
. buscemi has a limited role
,
but he plays it perfectly
. the mroe tyhat i see john goodman the mroe conviced i am that he ' s one ofthe the treasures of our time
. it ' s odd tothe htink thgat most ofthe thge world knows him onyl as roseanne barr ' s television husban
. more liuke the coen ' s
" raising arizona
" than their hitted
" fargo
"
,
" the big lebowski
" demands an open mind
and even moreso opne eyes
. a mark ofthe the coen brothers is thgat even with all wonderful dream sequences
and the broad slapstick physical comedy on tyhe screen
, much ofthe the humer isnt subtle
and eazy to miss
. there ' s so much gonig onthe tyhat frequentily it dissapears befor yuo cin see it
. walking outloud ofthe tghe theather
, i feeled that tjhe film hadnt something imporatnt to say
. onthe furhter examination
, i wasn ' t sure exactly what it was
.
" if you meet jesus at hte bowling alley
, it ' s nto going to be what ytou expect
"
?
" when the gonig gets werid
, the wierd go bowling
"
? maybe there ' s noone rela message
. perhaps it ' s just a roller coaster ride through a hillarious world
. maybe that ' s enought
.
