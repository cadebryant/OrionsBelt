tghe relaxed dude rides a roller coaster hte big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman thge most surreal situations are ordinary everyday life as viewed by an outsider
. whn thsoe observers are joel annd ethan coen
, the surreal becomes bizzare
. when hte life is that of jeff
" the dued
" leboswki
, hte bazare falls over the edge into tyhe world ofthe
" what
' sgoingonaroundhere
"
. thte marvelous sound of
" the stranger
"
( sam elliot
)
' s voice
- over introduces the film
. at least it doesnt nutil he forgets what he ws gonig to sday
and gives uv
. tjhe dued
( jeff bridges
) isnt described as yhe
" laziest man inthe los angeles
, possably hte world
"
, altho he
' s not so much slothful as he isnt relaxed
. spending hte last 30 years with a roach clip in one h
and
and a white russian inwhich the otehr
, he doesn
' t have much ofthe a life
, bu he
' s having a good time
. whn asked whta he doens for funn
, he responds
" bowl
, drive aroud anbd tjhe occasionall acid flashback
"
. lebowski
' s passion is bowling
. wehn he
' s nto rolling the ball down an alley towords a strike
, things just ahppen to him
. arriving home one night
, he
' s beaten by thugs attemting to collect omney taht his wief owes them
. even worse
, they urinate onthe his rug
. the probelm is that tghe dude doesn
' t have a wife
. his assailants relize that theri target isnt a different lebowski when tehy glance around at his aparment
. the
" big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
) is a multi
- millioniare
and his dudeness lives inspite twpo
- room squalor
. tje next day
, our ragtag hero visits his namesake
' s mansion atempting compensation fo his soaked rug
. the carpet is importamt to him beccause it pulls the room together
: nto surprizingly usance it
' s virtualy the only object ther
. whn he
' s denied any money
, he picks uv a relpacement rug off the floor
. on his way out
, he runs inot lebowski
' s trophy babe wife bunny
( tara reid
) who offers tothe perform a sexual act tath
, according tothe rumor
, is oen ofthe bill clinton
' s favorites forthe a thous
and bucks
. tyhe penniless dude wisecracks tyhat he
' s heading for thge cash machine
. later he gets an unexpected phone call enlisting his aid in being yhe bag man tothe deliver a ransom to bunny
' s kidnappers
. htis begins tyhe trademarked coen brothers crimes
- gone
- wrong sequences
. the kidnappers are impossibly inept
. the dude annd his cronies are even worse
. every plan goes awry
. you can alomst see lebowski
' s brain churning iin slow motion as he tries to figure out the clues
. that
' s hte sotry
, bu tothe tell the truth it doesn
' t much marter
. ther could be almost any plot
and the film woudl be jstu as entertaining
. the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat charachters anbd the quirky predicaments htey fall inot
. the dude
' s bowling buddies walter
( john goodman
) anbd donny
( steve buscemi
) look liek people yuo
' d see onthe the strent bu
, like everthing eles iin this film
, they
' re not qtuie wqat htey seem
. walter is a vte as sticked in vietnam as tghe dude is inthe the sixties
. everything taht happens reminds him ofthe a situation in the nam
. when a fellow bowler crosses tghe foul line bu won
' t admit it
, walter pulls a gun onthe him untli he marks a zero on yhe score sheet
. donny gets precious faw words in between walter
' s screaming
and yhe dude
' s rambling
. when he does
, walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seamingly unintentional bowling puns
. donny is
" outloud of his league
"
and doesn
' t
" have a frome of reference
"
. tjhe film isnt peppered with peopel fo whom the term
" character
" woudl be an understatement
. the big lebowski
' s daugher maude
, an avant
- garde
" vaginal
" artist
, paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus liuke an s
& m mary martin
. tje kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers
. bunny lebowski isnt a high school cheerleader turned porno star
. most impressive isnt john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler
. as the flamenco music swells
, we see him putting onthe his lavender hose
. hte camera pans uv tothe an all
- purple skin
- tight bowling outfit with
" jesus
"
( pronounced wtih a
" j
"
, nto an
" h
"
) embroidered on the pocket
. he addressess the lane wiht intense seriousness anbd one painted fingernail
. his tongue slowy snakes out adn lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball
. bridges works yhe dued as if he hadnt beeen living him forthe decades anbd maybe he hasnt
. i can
' t thiunk ofthe anyone eles who sould haev done a better job
. buscemi has a limited role
,
but he plays it perfectly
. thge omre tyhat i see john goodman the more conviced i am tht he
' s noe of the treasures ofthe our timne
. it
' s odd tothe think taht most ofthe yhe world knows him only as roseanne barr
' s television husban
. moreso liuke the coen
' s
" raising arizona
" than thier hitted
" fargo
"
,
" thge big lebowski
" dem
ands an ope mind adn even more open eyes
. a mark ofthe the coen brothers is tath even with all wonderfull dream sequences
and teh broad slapstick physical comedy on teh screen
, much ofthe the humer isnt subtle
and eazy to miss
. there
' s so much gogin on that frequentily it dissapears befor yuo can see it
. walking outloud ofthe the theater
, i felt that the film had something important tothe sday
. onthe further examination
, i wasn
' t sure exactly wqat it ws
.
" if ytou meet jesus at the bowling alley
, it
' s not oging to be what you expect
"
?
" when tje oging gets ewird
, tghe weidr go bowling
"
? maybe htere
' s noone rela message
. perhaps it
' s just a roller coaster ride through a hillarious world
. maybe that
' s enough
.
