" yuo
' ll go ape over tarzan beccause it
' s moreso fun thna a barrel of monkeys
!
" okay
, there
' s teh qoute inthe case disney wants to put something in thier ads for the movie
. disney
' s latest animated feature throws us right into tghe acation from tjhe very begining
, skipping tghe usual main title sequence
and puting us onthe pitching waves as a small familiy attemts tothe escape fomr a sinking ship
. father
, mother
,
and infant somehow mkea it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins
,
and ahev soon built a treehouse whihc woudl impress tyhe swiss family robinson
. it
' s amazing
, tyhe kinds ofthe things you cxan do when you work to a sountrack
. befoer ytou know it
, an unfortunate setted of circumstances put tje baby infact the h
ands ofthe kala
( glenn close
)
, a mother ape who recently lost her pwn baby to a predatory leopard
. aginst the wishes of her mate
and famaly leader
, kerchak
( lance henricksen
)
, she tkaes on the infant boy as her own
. tarzan is not so much a stoy about a human boy surviving infact tjhe african jungles as it isnt baout one who does not really fit in eather humanity or the wild
. much of tarzan
' s young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers adn his
" father
,
" which occasonally gets him inot trouble no matter how well
- meaned his attemts
. all he
' s looking for is acceptance
, perhpas a gool easily identifiable by young viewers
,
but one whic wiull ring true wih a lot of adults
. when you really htink about it
, this stor fits right inot hte disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end
. look back on past disney animated features
and yuo
' ll see tyhe trend
. growing uv
, tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz as a child
, anbd by tony goldwyn as an adult
) has a couple of friends
. oney isnt an ape named terk
( rosie o
' donnell
)
,
and the otehr is a paranoid hypochodriac ofthe an elephant named tantor
( wayne knight
)
. both provide the requisite comic relief
( timon annd poombah fomr the lion king immediately come to mind
)
and perfurd thge usual hijinks as prescribed by tje disney mold
. i
' m begining tothe htink anyone cant wriet the screenplay forthe oen of theese films
. jsut fill in hte blanks
! can you see it
?
" nowe we ahev to hve a cuple of zany friends forthe outloud hero who might git him into mischief
, bu cover forthe him or come tothe his rescure when he needs it
. we
' ve alreay had a fish adn a crab
,
and we
' ve hadnt a c
andle annd a teapot
, a genie
and a dog
, a few stone statues
.
.
.
. hvea we hadnt an ape
and an elphant yot
? well
, there we go
!
" ofthe course
, there
' s gotta be romance somewhere along tghe line
, so jane
( minnie driver
) gets introduced about halfway through
. toghether wih her father dr
. porter
( nigel hawthorne
) annd thte big gaem hunter clayton
( brian blessed
)
, jane isnt on an expedition to fidn
and studdy tjhe wild gorillas ofthe africa
. she discovers tghe man rised by apes adn isnt enchanted allmost immediatelly
, anbd soon shares an amusing verzion ofthe the compulsory
" yuo tarzan
, me jane
" scene
. thankfully
, thsoe aren
' t thte exact words
. howver
, i found it distracting that tarzan is going
" ohh ohh ee ee
" noe second annd thn tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction
. how does he tell his name to another ape
?
" ohh ohh ee
- tarzan
- ee ee ohh
?
" well
, irregardless ofthe my picky nature
, the romance actually works as only disney romance can
: purely contrived
, bu forthe soem reason rether believeable
. bu hey
, tarzan
' s a young adult
. dont you htink he dated a faw ofthe the female apes before meeting jane
? isn
' t that illiegal infact most ocuntries
? oh
, well
. i don
' t thiunk disney iwll be useing my qoute anymore
. tarzan departs fomr the usual disney feature inaddition that htis oney isnt nto a muscial
. there
' s lots of music to be sure
,
but not a single charater song in hte wohle hour
and a half of runing tyme
. we instade git more ofthe a phil collins concert
, as noone less tahn five ofthe his original songs are utilisied as interlude material
. this isn
' t realyl a bad thign
, as yhe songs are very high
- energy
and catchy
( i found myself singing noe to myself forthe most ofthe the following day
)
; it
' s just diferent
. do youself a favor
and see thsi film in a theather with a ogod soudn sytem
, baceause tjhe music wiull come thru astonishingly well anbd really enhance the movie
. wiht each new feature
, disney animation gets even better
. nto nessasarily by leaps
and bounds
,
but sicne tehy put out a new film each yearm
, a steady rate of improvement is apparen
, anbd this definitely shows inwhich tarzan
. there are a cuple of scenes where tjhe animation achieves a near 3
- d effect
, annd a number ofthe scenes which feature tarzan moving thru tghe trees are absolutly dizzying
. the way he slides down tree limbs
and trunks is very remenicent of skateboarding
and rollerblading maneuvers
,
and hadnt me thikning tihs isn
' t just tarzan
, it
' s
" extreme tarzan
.
"
however
, tarzan does nto seem tothe haev what i call its
" ch
andelier scene
,
" which isnt the one scene to whitch teh animators hvae choosen to devote an inordinate ammount of efford
, utilizing a computer
- assisted process that makse tghe animation absolutely breathtaking
. lasting bu a few seconds at most
, it
' s beeen yhe signature of nearly eveyr disney animated feature since beauty
and the beast
, inwhich hwihc the castle ballroom ch
andelier was rendered inspite stunning detail
. as usual
, the voice talent isnt up to snuff
, convincingly amking you beleive infront yhe convictions ofthe animated characters
. the oney poor choice infront casting
,
however
, wass rosie o
' donnell
. going inot yhe film
, i didn
' t konw she was even a part of it
, bu when terk started tlaking
, i recognized her voice immediately
. her performance wass fine
,
but thru thge rest ofthe yhe film i kept thinking
,
" that
' s noone boy ape
, that rosie o
' donnell
.
" distracting tothe sday the least
. i
' ll admited i
' ve never read the edgar rice burroughs sotry
" tarzan of the apes
,
" so i couldn
' t tell you how true this film stays to the book
.
but unless yuo
' re a purist
, you should have few objections tothe htis film
. with solid performances
, acation
, adventure
, a bit of romance
, adn grat music
and animation
, tarzan should appeal tothe thte kids
and tothe the kid in all of us
. note
: whn i wrote my review of mulan a year ago
, i went off onthe the promotional
and merch
andising tie
- ins prevelant iwth the release ofthe a disney animated feature
. thsi timne
, i
' ll just say tht i went tothe mcdonald
' s yesterday tothe treat myself tothe a mcflurry
, adn tarzan wass onthe tjhe cup
.
