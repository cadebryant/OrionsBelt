" yuo ' ll go ape over tarzan becuase it ' s omre fun than a barrel of monkeys
!
" okay
, there ' s tjhe quote inthe case disney wants to put something inwhich theri ads for the movie
. disney ' s latest animated feature throws us right into the acation fomr the very beginning
, skipping tjhe usual main title sequence
and puting us onthe pitching waves as a small family attemts tothe escape from a sinking ship
. father
, mother
,
adn infant somehow make it tothe shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins
,
adn have soon builded a treehouse which owudl imbaress thge swiss famaly robinson
. it ' s amazing
, the kinds ofthe things yuo cant do when you wokr to a sountrack
. befoer yuo nkwo it
, an unfortunate setted ofthe circumstances put tyhe baby infront the hands ofthe kala
( glenn close
)
, a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard
. against hte wishes ofthe her mate
and family leader
, kerchak
( lance henricksen
)
, she tkaes onthe the infant boy as her pwn
. tarzan is nto so much a storey baout a human boy surviving infact teh african jungles as it is baout one who doesnt nto really ift in either humanity or thte wild
. much of tarzan ' s young life is spended trying to become oney of yhe apes in the eyes ofthe his peers
and his
" father
,
" which occasionally gets him inot trouble no matter how well
- meant his attempts
. all he ' s looking fo isnt accptance
, perheaps a gool easily identifiable by young viewers
,
bu one which will ring true with a lot ofthe adults
. whn ytou really thiunk about it
, this stopry fits right inot tjhe disney forumla ofthe tghe outcast that triumphs in yhe end
. look back on past disney animated features
and yuo ' ll see the trend
. growing uv
, tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz as a child
,
and by tony goldwyn as an adult
) has a cuple ofthe firends
. oney is an ape named terk
( rosie o ' donnell
)
,
adn the otehr is a paranoid ypochondriac of an elephant named tantor
( wayne knight
)
. both provide the requisite comic releaf
( timon
anbd poombah ffrom the lion king immediately come tothe mind
)
anbd perform yhe usual hijinks as prescribed by tjhe disney mold
. i ' m begining to htink anyone cin rwite the screenplay fo oen ofthe these films
. jsut fill in the blanks
! can you see it
?
" nowe we hvae tothe ahve a couple ofthe zany firends forthe outloud hero who might git him into mischief
,
but cover fo him or cmo tothe his rescure wehn he needs it
. we ' ve alread hadnt a fish
adn a crab
,
and we ' ve hadnt a candle
annd a teapot
, a genie
annd a dog
, a few stone statues
.
.
.
. have we hadnt an ape
anbd an elphant
yot
? well
, ther we go
!
" ofthe course
, there ' s gotta be romance somewhere allong the line
, so jane
( minnie driver
) gets introdued baout halfway thru
. together wih her father dr
. porter
( nigel hawthorne
)
and the big game hunter clayton
( brian blessed
)
, jane is on an expedition to fidn
and study thte wild gorillas of africa
. she dicovers the man rised by apes
anbd is enchanted almost immediately
,
annd soon shares an amusing verison ofthe the compulsary
" yuo tarzan
, me jane
" scene
. thankfully
, those aren ' t the excact words
.
howver
, i foudn it distracting thgat tarzan is goign
" ohh ohh ee ee
" one second
and
then tells jane his nmae in tihs manly voice withthe perfect diction
. how doesnt he tell his name to anyother ape
?
" ohh ohh ee
- tarzan
- ee ee ohh
?
" well
, regardless ofthe my picky nature
, tjhe romance actually works as only disney romance can
: purely contrived
,
but fo some reason rether believeable
.
bu hey
, tarzan ' s a young adult
. do ytou tihkn he dated a faw of hte female apes before meeting jane
? isn ' t tath ilegle infact most counries
? oh
, well
. i don ' t think disney wiull be useing my quote anymore
. tarzan departs fomr thte usual disney feature iin taht htis noe is not a musical
. there ' s lots ofthe music tothe be sure
,
but not a single charactor song inaddition tjhe whole hour
anbd a half of runnung time
. we instead get more ofthe a phil collins concert
, as no less tahn five of his origional songs are utilizied as interlude material
. htis isn ' t really a bad thign
, as tjhe songs are very high
- energy
and catchy
( i foudn mysef singing one to mysef for most ofthe the following day
)
; it ' s just diffrent
. do yourself a favor
annd see thsi film in a theater withthe a good sound system
, becuase tje music wiull come through astonishingly well
anbd raelly enhance tjhe movie
. wiht earch newyorker feature
, disney animation gets even better
. not necessarily by leaps
and bounds
,
but since tehy put outloud a newyorker film each year
, a steady rate ofthe improvment is apparent
,
adn tihs definatly shows in tarzan
. ther are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3
- d effect
,
and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through thte trees are absolutely dizzying
. the way he slides down tree limbs
anbd trunks is vyer reminiscent of skateboarding
adn rollerblading maneuvers
,
adn hadnt me thikning htis isn ' t jstu tarzan
, it ' s
" extreme tarzan
.
"
however
, tarzan does nto seem tothe hvea wqat i call its
" chandelie scene
,
" which is tyhe oney scene tothe which the animators have choosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort
, utilizing a coputer
- assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking
. lating
bu a few seconds at most
, it ' s been thte signature of nearly eveyr disney animated feature since beauty
anbd the beast
, in whihc the castle ballroom chandelier wass rendered in stunning detail
. as usual
, the voice talent isnt uv tothe snuff
, convincingly make you believe in yhe convictions ofthe animated cahracters
. the one poore choice in casting
,
howver
, was rosie o ' donnell
. oging inot the film
, i didn ' t know she wass even a part of it
,
bu whn terk started talking
, i recognized her voice immidately
. her performence was fine
,
but thru the rest ofthe thge film i kept thinking
,
" thgat ' s no boy ape
, thgat rosie o ' donnell
.
" distracting tothe sday tyhe least
. i ' ll admited i ' ve never read the edgar rice burroughs stoyr
" tarzan of the apes
,
" so i couldn ' t tell you how true tihs film stays tothe tyhe book
.
bu unless you ' re a purist
, yuo should haev faw objections to tihs film
. wtih solid performances
, acation
, adventure
, a bited of romance
,
annd grat music
anbd animation
, tarzan shoudln appeal to the kids
and tothe teh kid in all ofthe us
. onot
: when i wrote my review of mulan a yera ago
, i whent off onthe the promotional
and merchandising tie
- ins prevelant witht the realease of a disney animated feature
. thsi tiome
, i ' ll jsut sday that i went tothe mcdonald ' s yesterday tothe treat mysef tothe a mcflurry
,
anbd tarzan was on the cup
. ' nuff said
