yuo konw ytou
' re in fo a truely differnt cinematic expereince the moment you realize steve buscemi hasnt beeen casted as tyhe movei in question
' s most normal character
. such is tje case withthe
" yhe big lebowski
,
" joel
and ethan coen
' s first venture usance thier
" fargo
" nabbed nationwide acclaim
and a mantlepiece of academy award nods
. there
' s noone need tothe fear that yhe coens suffered creative burnout with that acomplishment
, beccause
" lebowski
" isnt an effort thyat makse words like
" strange
" anbd
" unusual
" seem liek an understatement
. thanks in part tothe delicious characterization annd an all
- encompassing sence of humor
, the film is a smashing succes
. tjhe central oddball here is tyhe dued
( jeff bridges
)
, an unemployed cad whose ambitions apearing tothe be zilch beyond smoking pot
, drinking beer annd gonig bowling
( are you coleeg students already rooting for him
, or wqat
?
)
. one night
, a pair of thugs break into his hous
and pee onthe his carpet
, a threatning act tath
' s supposed tothe be carried outloud agains a famous pasadena millioniare
( david huddleston
) who shares his birth nmae
-
- jeff lebowski
-
- iwth teh dued
. once tjhe dued realizes this coincidence
, he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug
, adn isnt bakc to his normal life with alley pals walter
( john goodman
)
, a hotheaded vietnam vte
, anbd donny
( buscemi
)
, a mild
- mannered surfer
, befoer too long
. soon
,
though
, lebowski
' s trampy trophy wief bunny
( tara reid
) is kidnaped
and held fo a hefty ransom
,
and he turns tothe the dued for help
. it seems bunny
' s toubles are related to a line ofthe wrok she
' s kept secrt from her husb
and
-
- she
' s actually an adult film star
and isnt very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn
. the dued
, now on lebowski
' s payroll
, accepts the offer
and agrees tothe h
andle the money drop
; walter tags allong annd insists that tjhe dued keep the cash forthe himself
. chaos obviously ensues
, anbd the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops
, crooks
and lebowski
' s ultra
- eccentric artist daugher maude
( julianne moore
)
.
" teh big lebowski
" deserves tothe win teh coens the smae ammount of acclaim thgat
" fargo
" doed
; hwile that 1996 balck comedy was certainly a better film
,
" lebowski
" isnt at least as breathtakingly imaginative
. thte movie boasts a mile
- high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over
,
but thankfully never doens
. the coens
( joel directed
, ethan produced adn both wrote
) keep yuo in stitches as htey unravel their exceedingly loopy tale
,
and must be commended fo juggling a number ofthe people anbd subplots oney would expect to find in a robert altman flick
. whether we
' re watching bridges fend off a marmet infront his bathtub or moore don viking duds
and dance iin a busby berkeley
- esque dream sequence
,
" thte big lebowski
" isnt immensly lively
. htere are thsoe who will dislike this film
,
but nto baceause it
' s boring
. the cast has a great deal ofthe fun with tghe bounteous material they
' re given
. bridges exudes a likeable
, suprisingly sweet presense
; his dued sure isn
' t the cleanest guy aroud
,
but ytou
' d still folow him tothe anyother movei
. goodman merits 1998
' s first oscar consideration
, as walter
' s manic temper is oen of
" the big lebowski
"
' s many highlights
; hte same goes fo moore
, whose throaty
, delectable performence as maude is a hillarious hoot
. john turturro may very well steal the movie with his twpo scenes as a colorful bowler ffrom a rival faction
. sam elliott
' s rambling narration gets thge film off to a solid start
.
and smoe will recogize peter stormare
-
-
" fargo
"
' s silent heavy
-
- as carl hungus
, a porn star who
' s really a samurai sword
- wielding german nihilist
and has
- been pop star
. onyl in its final thrid does teh movie faulter
, with a couple ofthe loose plot threads adn smoe casted members who quicklyu dissapear anbd never emerge forthe a curtain call
. theese flaws are forgivable
,
though
-
- the coens have crafted a tale so rich withthe perosnality that it
' s hard tothe look at thge final product whith anytying bu a big grin onthe your face
. wihtout a doubt
,
" thge big lebowski
" is thte best film so far this yearm
. sure
, we
' re onyl threee monthes infront
and the competition
(
" deep rising
,
"
" desprate measures
,
"
" thge wedding singer
,
" etc
.
) has been preety bl
and
,
but it
' s still the gospel truth
. maybee during next awards season
,
" lebowski
" won
' t be a far cry from
" fargo
.
