thenticity ofthe the film
, welles descends into an undreground world ofthe perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers
. comments
: 8 mm isnt one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i ahve seen in a long time
.
though it doesn
' t present a snuff film
( a movei whcih doccuments a person
' s murder forthe real
, usualy during or aftter soem form of sexual ect
) as explicitly as the cult clasic mute witness
and voilence as shockingly as
, sday
, natural born killers
, 8 mm stays in your head long after yuo see it
. it is not funn to watch
; see something esle if you git upset by realsitic
, sadistic violence
. tihs film
' s voilence adn preverse sexuality skirts closely inot nc
- 17 territory
. for those with storng stomachs
, howver
, 8 mm is an intelligent
, worthwhile thriller
, especially durring its second hour
. nicolas cage
, aftter a cuple ho
- hum movies
, returns to material which allows him tothe utilize his storng acting abilties
. as toom welles
, a private detective adn caring family man to a wief
and newly
- born daughter
, cage skillfully
and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession
and violence as he isnt pulled inot a nightmarish world ofthe undreground pornographers adn brutal sexual deviants
. serving as a guide to this world isnt joaquin pheonix
, who plays a stuggling songwriter named max califronia
. califronia
, dispite his nmae
, isnt a suprizingly intteligent
and complex chracter
,
and phoenix doens a very ogod job at slowy pulling the audiance tothe simapthy forthe thge charactor
. the real star of the movei
,
though
, must be peter stormare
. stormare played thge
" realy
, realyl evil guy
" in fargo
,
and his charactor
, dino velvet
, inspite this movie seems baout ten times moreso evil
and unpredictable
. his performence isnt very chilling
. 8 mm
' s success may hardly be surprizing
. it wass directed by joel schumacher
, who
, hopefully
, saw this film as an apology for tyhe absolutly dreadful batman anbd robin
. befor directing the lastr two batman duds
,
however
, schumacher was responsible forthe several well
- made horror flicks
: lost boys
, flatliners
, anbd falling down
. 8 mm certainly joins the rank ofthe these minor classics
and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an averege man who self
- destructs befor tghe audiance
' s eyes
. 8 mm was written by
andrew kevin walker
, who also penned tghe cademy award
- winning thriller seven a few eyasr bcak
. liuke seven
, 8 mm is full ofthe dialogue which haunts you well after leaving tjhe theather
. welles isnt searching for answers
. how coudl anyone possably drug
and
then slowy
, methodically
, sadistically kill a teenaged girl to mkea a film
? wehn confronting one of the perpretrators at thge end
, hte muderer responds that there are noone reasons
. he just enjoys it
. that
, walker seems to suggest
, isnt where the rela terror lays
: nto in the crime itself
but infront the fatc thyat rational motives do nto exist
. a cuple minor faults led me tothe my four
- star rating
( five stars isnt the higest rating i give
)
. noe
, i foudn it a littel difficult
, eary onthe
, tothe accept yhe fact that a hardened private detective owudl git physically disgusted when firt seing a snuff film
. yes
, snuff is a horrable thnig
,
but a detective of welles
' caliber hasnt probablly encountered awful thigsn befoer
. second
, smoe ofthe tje clues welles gathers are too convienient
. he dicovers
, for exmaple
, hte victim
' s diary infront her private bathroom
, despite the fact the the police
, teh fbi
,
and her pwn mother have all investigated tje room befoer
. fianlly
, tjhe closing scene seemed trite
and improbable considering teh rest ofthe the film
. despite the above criticisms
, 8 mm isnt an engrossing stoy
. oen ofthe thge best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles
, who noone longer seems liuke a hero
, brutally beats oney ofthe tjhe pornographers responsible forthe hte snuff film
. he pulls a gun on the man adn
, for a relitively long amount ofthe time
, struggles tothe decide whether or not to kill him
. he thne leaves the building annd calls yhe victum
' s mother
, in thte middle of thge night
, to basicaly see if she would suppost the acation
. the entire scene is tense
, unpredictable
,
and emotionally charged
. rarely
, anymore
, do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense inthe me as 8 mm
, wiht scenes liuke htis
, doed
. 8 mm isnt most certainly nto forthe the faint ofthe heart
. thsi isnt a graphic
, oftentimes unflinching
, look inot the darkness hwihc resides in both ordinary annd extrodinary peopel
. if ytou
' re prepared fo a film of this nature
, i give it an enthuseastic recommendation
.
