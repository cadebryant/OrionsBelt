ytou
' ve got mial works alot better than it deserves to
. iin order to mkae the film a sucess
, all they had to dont ws casted two extremely popular adn attractive stars
, ahve them share the screen for baout two hours annd
then collect tghe profits
. no rela acting was involved adn there is nto an original or inventive bone in it
' s body
( it
' s basically a complete re
- shoot of the shop arund thge corner
, only adding a faw modern twists
)
. essentialy
, it goes againnst annd defies all concepts ofthe ogod contempoary filmmaking
. it
' s overly sentimental
and at times terribly mushy
, nto tothe mention very manipulative
.
but oh
, how enjoyable thyat manipulation is
. bu ther must be something other than thte casting
and manipulation thta makes the movie owrk as well as it doesnt
, because i absolutely hated teh previous ryan
/ hanks teaming
, sleepless in seattle
. it couldn
' t haev been tghe directing
, baceause both films weere helmed by tjhe smae woman
. i haven
' t quite
yet figured outloud what i liked so much baout you
' ve got mial
, bu
then agina
, is thyat really imporatnt
? if ytou liek something so much
, why even question it
? again
, the storyline is as cliched as htey come
. tom hanks plays joe fox
, the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain anbd meg ryan plays kathleen kelley
, the even mroe insanely likeable proprieter ofthe a familiy
- run children
' s book shop called
, inspite a nice homage
, hte shop arround the corner
. fox adn kelley soon become bitter rivals baceause thge new fox books store is oppening uv right acros the block ffrom the small business
. littel dont tehy knwo
, they are allready in lveo with each other over the internet
, only niether party knwos tyhe otehr person
' s true identity
. tyhe rest of thte stor isn
' t important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop fo tje two stars to share the screen
. sure
, htere are smoe mildly interesting subplots
, bu they all fail infront comparison to the utter cuteness ofthe tyhe main relationship
. all of thsi
, ofthe course
, leads uv to the predicatble climax
.
but as foreseeable as the ending is
, it
' s so damn cute
and well
- done that i doubt any movei in hte entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as thsi part doens
. wehn ryan discovers tje true idenity of her online love
, i was filled with such
, for lack of a better owrd
, happiness thta for the frist time all eyar
, i actully left yhe theater smiling
.
