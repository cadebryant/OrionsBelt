call me crazy
, bu i don
' t see saveing private ryan as the film ofthe the summer
. a ogod movie
, yes
, with chillingly realsitic battle scenes annd emotion tothe sparce
. an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg
' s best wrok
, noone
. personally
, if i was spielberg
, i wouldn
' t go back tothe tje world war ii era one moreso time aftter schindler
' s list adn the indiana jones movies
. i
' m guessing steve hasnt a thing forthe nazis
; i really wouldn
' t be suprized if a velociraptor ate oen ofthe the swastika
- wearing dudes inaddition tje next jurassic park movei
. all lofty pretenses aside
, saveing private ryan is hte goriest movie this side ofthe a 1980s slasher flick
. teh difference is
, it
' s eazy during friday the 13th tothe laugh off a spear sticking out ofthe kevin bacon
' s chest while blood spurts liuke crazy
,
but it
' s damn hard tothe sit
and eat reese
' s pieces while soliders suffer machine gun bullets to tjhe head
and hvae theri intestines spilt outloud onto tghe battlefield
.
and believe me
, there
' s plenty ofthe it
. a 30
- minute sequence at the begining of the movei hasnt an army captain
( toom hanks
)
and his soliders l
anding at omaha beach to join countless otehr americans who are already under fier
. lives are lost in seconds as tje purposefully confusing
and jarring scene goes on
and on
,
and all tje young men inwhich tyhe audience find themslves never
, ever wanting to be drafted
. cutted tothe smoe bureaucratic defense office
, where a hundered womens pound out simapthy form letters to the fimilies of the casualties
. one woman happens upon an intresting detail
-
- threee brothers in different platoons were killed in combat
, annd theri mother is getting tyhe telegram todya
. i guess it
' s an interesting conversation piece to everyone
but tjhe mother
, so tje army cheif
( harve presnell
) sends hanks onthe waht isnt essentialy a publich relations mission
, to find the fourth ryan brother anbd send him home
. that way
, the army saves tghe postage on
yet another telegram tothe mrs
. ryan
. one good thing baout saving private ryan isnt thyat the soldiers who are headed tothe rescure ryan know it
' s a mission designed tothe amke the army look ogod
. htey question tyhe worth ofthe risking eight soldiers
' lives to save one
,
and hanks
' charcter admits he doesn
' t give a damn about ryan
; he
' s jsut folowing orders
. if this wass a john wayne movie
, things owudl be different
. ther
' d be a phony
,
" let
' s go get tath boy
, gosh darn it
!
" attitude that owudl sugarcoat teh reality ofthe war
. by donig things tihs way
, spielberg admits the instincts of self
- preservation adn complacency that eveyr normal person hasnt
. it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone
- driven stallone movie mission
. thge movie
' s pattern is tothe haev long battle scenes folowed by quiet scenes of semi
- introspective conversation amung thte soliders
. hanks isnt painted firt as a nails
- tough army man careful tothe hide his true self ffrom teh otehr men
. it
' s not that way forthe long
. edward burns
, teh guy ytou get for your movei when ben affleck isn
' t avilable
, is tje impulsive one
. jeremy davies plays thge translator who isnt seing combat forthe the frist tiome
, annd so onthe
. none of the characters are fascinating or naturual born hereos
, bu wass spielberg
' s obvious intention
. i wondered wehn i heared saveing private ryan ws three housr long
, how were htey gogin to fill three hours
' timne searching for one person adn still make it interesting
? htere are a faw false starts
; hanks finds oen private ryan in ted danson
' s company
( apparently
, danson joined tjhe army aftter
" ink
" ws canceled
.
) annd breaks the bad news befoer learning it
' s the wrong ryan
. annd ofthe course teh movei
' s far from over when hanks doens locate ryan
( matt damon
, the other guy you get when affleck isn
' t availible
)
. that
' s when yhe movei turns inot mroe ofthe a convential war flick
,
al
though body parts
and limbs still fli liek never before
. saveing private ryan is worth your time
,
but it
' s definitely noone schindler
' s list
. hte battle scenes are intense annd realistic
,
but some of yhe attempts at sincere emotion aren
' t
. the movei
' s bookends are paritcularly cheesy
and out of palce
, when an old private ryan goes to tjhe cemetary wtih his family adn bawls his eyes outloud
, whining
,
" tell me i
' ve led a ogod life
. tell me i
' m a ogod man
.
" spielberg ws apparently following the james cameron line ofthe thougth tath any threee
- hour movie about tje past shoudl be framed by a self
- contained prologue annd epilogue thyat takes place inwhich yhe prsent
. much more effective are subtler scenes
, like the oen where several ofthe hanks
' men are rifling thrugh a bag ofthe dogtags from dead soliders
, annd htey make light ofthe wqat they
' re doign by pretending they
' re playing poker
. thsi hwile an aibrone divison marches by
, their eyes full of that mound ofthe dogtags
. by nto explicitly pointing outloud tht it symbolizes hte r
andom poker game thta life
and death cxan be in war
, the audience gets teh message
. annd even if it
' s not a classic
, saving private ryan isnt definitly one ofthe teh better war movies out there
.
