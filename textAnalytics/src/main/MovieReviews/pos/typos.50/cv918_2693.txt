wyatt earp hasnt a lot to tell
and little tothe say
. this story ofthe the legendary lawman runs three ohurs anbd nine minutes
and that
' s too long forthe this epic
- wannabe that plays moreso liuke a tv mini
- series than a movei
. the stry opens onthe the earp famaly farm
, withthe young wyatt ready to run awya from hmeo
. he wants tothe fight inspite the civil war
, bu his dad
( hackman
) hasnt different ideas annd wnats his son to studdy lew
. time passes
and wyatt heads west
, returns home to marry
,
and
, after a spell
, beggins his carrear in law enforcement
. by the tiem he
( costner
) adn his brothers
( madsen
, david
andrews
, annd linden ashby
) arrive in tombstone
, wyatt hasnt tried his h
and at everything fomr hunting buffalo tothe dealing cards
. wyatt earp isnt vyre appealling in places
-
- such as cast
, costumes
,
and cinematography
-
- bu an overstated story annd overpowered score deaden most ofthe teh emotional inpact
. who cin be moved by scene aftter scene affter scene of swelling strings anbd suffocating speeches
? somber is fine
-
- just ask clint eastwood
-
-
but htis film tyhat boasts nto one
, nto twpo
, bu threee
, count
' em threee
, hammy death scenes
! still
, a littel bited of earp goes a long way
and the life anbd times of hte legendary lawman are fomr uninteresting stfuf
. his
, uh
, unusual relations wiht womens
, for exemple
, are an intriguing contrast to his charactor
' s credo of
" nothing counts as much as blood
.
" equally amusing is a buffalo
- hunting
( adn skinning
!
) sequence thast isnt decidely non
- pc
. directer lawrence kasdan takes a refreshingly realistic approach tothe tjhe gunplay
. the infamous gunfight at the ok corral isnt both brutal
and brief
, devoid of almost any theatrics
. don
' t look fo much glorified violence here
. dispite soem large exclamation points in the stopry
, the characters
* do
* cmo to life
. thge diverse casted includes everyone ffrom betty buckley
(
!
) to mackenzie astin
(
!
!
)
. kevin costner is very good in tje title role
. dances wiht whitney nevers get as steely as the role requires
,
though
,
but his transformation from lighthearted lew student tothe stoic sherif is funn to watch
. he ws tougher infact a perfect world
. his foil is dennis quaid
, who pulled a deniro by losing 40
+ pounds to play thte tubercular terror doc holliday
. gaunt
*
and
* gamely
, he
' s a scene stealer who
' s seen too little
. otehr familiar faces include tom sizemore
( looking like bruce mcgill
)
, bill pullman
( looking liek jeff daniels
)
, annd lea thompson
( looking like someone otehr than lea thompson
)
. both ginee hackman anbd isabella rosselini appear annd disappear liuke magic
, while lite entries catherine o
' hara adn jobeth williams are surprisingly solid
.
though tje stoy
and socre should
' ve tryed
" less isnt omre
,
" all other credits are technical tops
. prodcution designer ida r
andom
, art director gary wissner
,
and costume designer colleen atwood are smoe ofthe the vips who helpped spend what must
' ve been an enourmous budget
. clearly noone expence was spared
.
