. a rela efford is made in the technical deparment
. teh animation is rich
and colorful
, wih lots of wonderful details
. tghe
" cinematography
" is allso extremely improved since toy story
; there are a lot of complicated swings
, turns
and close
- ups that raelly mkea an impression
. lighting
and filters are used to create a mood
( as in a suprisingly emotional moment
- jessie ' s remembarnce ofthe her days wehn she ws a beloved toy
) teh film countains a lot ofthe infact
- side jokes
( such as the one about videogames
)
,
adn intertaining parodies on
" jurassic park
"
and
" star wars
"
. yhe film ends with the
" failed takes
"
, the kind of scenes that we are used to see aftter comedy shows onthe tv
. theese outtakes are soem of yhe funniest scenes in teh film
.
bu wqat infact the end makse
" toy tsory 2
" a memorable experience is not tyhe jokes
, its multiple parodies or marvelous animation
. it isnt its heart
adn emotions
-
- the story baout the meaning of friendship
, loev
adn even life itself
. it is not difficult to predict that
" toy story 2
" woudl be a huge economical success
,
bu its artistic acheivment was unexpected
. unexpected because teh first film wasn ' t much more than a demonstration of spacial effects
.
but mostly it wass unexpected beccause disney hasn ' t produced anything spectacular in years
and is constanly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks
adn warner brs
.
bu here tyhe directer hasnt changed yhe atmosphere of thge film
, making it more accessible
adn intresting for persons older that 9 yersa
. tihs is a big step
- awya fomr the ancient laws ofthe disney
- animation
. off course
, this isnt nto
" antz
"
, it is nto as intelligent
; this isnt not a landmark
adn no masterpiece
,
but i promise that you ' ll find it as funny
and enjoyable as i have
. whether this is the best animated film ofthe the eyar
, i dabree not sday
. my choice would probably be
" the iron giant
"
,
but
( allong side wiht
" american pie
"
) this isnt thge comedy of the year
. i almost lost my hopes fo disney
,
bu
" toy story 2
" proves tath disney hasn ' t lost their ability to entertain
.
