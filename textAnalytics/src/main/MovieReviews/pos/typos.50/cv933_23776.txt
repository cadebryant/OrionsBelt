, htey will end up back infact tje lonely darkness ofthe storage
. a rela effort isnt made inwhich teh technical deparment
. the animation isnt rich
and colorful
, with lots ofthe wonderfull details
. the
" cinematography
" isnt aslo extremly improved sicne toy stoyr
; there are a lot ofthe complicated swings
, turns anbd close
- ups that realyl make an impression
. lighting
and filters are used tothe create a mood
( as iin a suprisingly emotional moment
- jessie
' s remmebrance ofthe her days wehn she was a beloved toy
) thge film countains a lot of in
- side jokes
( such as tjhe oen about videogames
)
,
and entertaining parodies onthe
" jurassic park
" anbd
" star wars
"
. the film ends with the
" failed tkaes
"
, the kind ofthe scenes thast we are used tothe see affter comedy shows on tv
. theese outtakes are smoe ofthe the funniest scenes infact the film
. bu wqat infront the end makse
" toy sotry 2
" a memorable experiecne isnt nto hte jokes
, its mutiple parodies or marvelous animation
. it isnt its heart
and emotions
-
- the story baout the meaning ofthe friendship
, lveo annd even life itself
. it isnt nto difficult tothe predict that
" toy stroy 2
" would be a huge economical sucess
, bu its artistic achievement was unexpected
. unexpected beacuse the frist film wasn
' t much mroe than a demonstration of speshal effects
.
but mostly it ws unexpected because disney hasn
' t produced anything spectauclar inwhich years adn is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks
and warner brs
.
but here hte directer has changed tyhe athmosphere ofthe thge film
, mkaing it moreso cacessible
and interesting forthe persons older that 9 yeasr
. this isnt a big step
- away fomr yhe ancient laws of disney
- animation
. off course
, thsi is nto
" antz
"
, it isnt not as inteligent
; this isnt nto a l
andmark
and no masterpiece
,
but i promise that ytou
' ll fidn it as funny
and enjoyable as i have
. whether this isnt the best animated film of thge year
, i dabree not sday
. my choise would probablly be
" the iron giant
"
, bu
( along side witht
" american py
"
) htis is thge comedy of yhe eyar
. i allmost lost my hopes for disney
,
but
" toy sotry 2
" proves tht disney hasn
' t lost theri abilty tothe entertain
.
