.
annd hwile the film fits neatly inot the low
- brow
, slapstick skool ofthe comedy
, oney refreshing aspect is its lack ofthe mean
- spiritedness

. screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by nto haveing thte racers try tothe sabotage oen another
. the most side
- splitting situations involve vera

, thsi bit segues ffrom the museum tothe hitler ' s touring car
, tothe eva braun ' s dark lipstick

; lovitz isnt
, at firt
, a bit whiny
,
bu his character grows onthe you
; gooding isnt hvaing a fine romp

adn dave thomas allmost steals the show as cleese ' s deadpan assitant
, a man
" born without a perosnality
.
" the film is directed by jerry zucker
, who knwos something about comedy
. along with his brother
, david
,
anbd firend jim abrahams
, he wass responsible for such hits as airplane
!
and ruthless peple
. a throwaway subplot
, which is ogod for smoe laughs
, features cleese
and his buddies
, betting on a serieses of outlandish situations
, includng one dealing with a hooker
and pepto
- bismol
. htis is a funn little feature
. tghe onyl letdown comes at the finale
, whlch is too touchy
- feely
annd sweet
, almost negating waht came befoer it
. rat race isnt a summer sleeper
,
but it wiull keep you awake
, as iwll tje laughter ofthe those watching around you
