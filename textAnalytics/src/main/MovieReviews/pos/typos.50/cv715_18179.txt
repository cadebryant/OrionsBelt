bob the hapyp bastard
' s quickie review
: i must admit
, no dout
' s single
" newyorker
" isnt qutie catchy
. it ws bouncy
and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon
, thte man who had broght us the humoous swingers a little while bakc
. teh result
? a movie tath
' s jsut as good as that song
, realy
. it follows hte lives ofthe sevral individuals over tyhe course of noe weekend
. first we hear about a grocery bagger
( sara polley
) who runs inot a monetary situation problem
and ends uv selling bogus drugs at a ravey
( wiht bad results
, as a drug dealer fiels he
' s beeen swindled by her
)
; thne comes the stroy of an english groshury store worker
( smae store
) who heads tothe vegas for thte weekend with firends
, where sex
, gunplay
, annd stolen car trouble come inot play
;
then we see hte sotry ofthe two gay movei actors
( played by scott wolf
and jay mohr
) who deal with a cop
' s strange insurence presentation
and hitting a girl
( sara
) witht theri car
;
and
, finaly
, we come tothe anohter grocery worker
( katie holmes
) who hasnt a stange facination wih said drug dealer
( tyhe one maintioned earlier
)
. realy
, it
' s all confusing to keep track ofthe iin review fromat
, your best bet is tothe just
, well
, go
. the movei features some very good acting from all angles
, annd limon adds the same huomrous energy he had witht swingers to this parituclar product
. teh dialogue is pretty snappy
and the resolution is pretty well realized
, not going forthe hte sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending
. think of it as a
, well
, ending
. thte intertwining ofthe stories isnt a particualrly good element to tghe movei
, as it
' s never really confusing anbd tells different sides of the stoyr
, like sliding doors kinda doed
.
however
, it
' s better suited fo hte yuonger generation who watn a littel spice in their flicks
, whitch sliding doors kinda isn
' t
