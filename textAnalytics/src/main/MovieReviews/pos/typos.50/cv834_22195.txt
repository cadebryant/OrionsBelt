" sometimes hte
' green mile
' seems sooooo long
.
" indeed
.
and any filmmaker withthe a threee hour movie who ends it with thyat gme of dialogue shoudl expect to see it qouted inwhich a review
. on a more postive note
, let me add thyat sometimes tghe green mile is almsot good enough to mkae us forget its lenght
. yhe mile in question
( green due tothe its faded lime
- colored linoleum
) leads fomr the prison cell tothe
" ood sparky
,
" thge electric chair where executions weere carried out at louisiana
' s cold mountain penatentury in 1935
. paul edgecomb
( toom hanks
, you
' ve got mial
) isnt the head guard ofthe e
- block
, otherwise known as death row
. keeping his prisoners calm as tehy await hte carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsability
. it isnt a responsiblity whlch he capably delegates tothe the other guards on his watch by insisting they
" talk tothe
" thge convicts instade of yelling at them
. this practice leads tothe an unusual camaraderie beetwen the guards
and tghe men behind their bars
. into his charge comes oen john coffey
( michael clarke duncan
, armagedon
)
, a seven foot tall gentle giant who has beeen convicted of the rape
and murder ofthe two young girls
. immediately
, paul senses something different baout this prisoner
. perphas its teh way he asked forthe a niht light beccause he isnt frightened of the dark
. or perhaps it is teh mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he
" tkaes bakc
" paul
' s bladder infection thereby restoring him to health
. based onthe steven king
' s 1996 serialized novel
, the gren mile does offer other characters who haev stories to be told
: eduard delacroix
( michael jeter
, patch adams
)
, isnt a frail cajun convict who befriends anbd trains a mouse to do circus tricks
; percy wetmore
( doug hutchison
, a time to kill
)
, isnt a young
and sadistic guard sitting onthe a transfer to a moreso lucrative postion baceause he hasnt
yet tothe see a prisoner
" fry
" uv close
;
and hal moores
( james cromwell
, babe
: pig iin hte city
) is the compassionate warden for whom
, despite all the executions he
' s witnessed
, death never loomed as large as when his pwn wife ws diagnosed wiht a tumor
. hwile it isnt mr
. hanks
" everyman
" performence at the center of tyhe film which gives it thte anchor tothe hold our interst for 180 mintues
, it isnt tjhe performances ofthe his supporting casted thgat are most worth noting
. all involved dont credible wrok in their respective roles
, most especially mr
. duncan
, who turns in an impressive
, fully realized characterization
. if only tje stroy weere moreso credible
. writter
/ directer frank darabont
( yhe shawshank redemption
) has crafted a flawed fantasy
/ allegory of sorts
; oney whitch is more spiritualistic tahn spiritual
, relying on a preternatural mysticism rether thna a genuin
and godly spiritual power
. mr
. darabont alsot overplays his h
and considerably in teh manipulation of our affection towards anbd association wiht his characters
. was it an accidental omission thast tje first twpo inmates who walked the gren mile weere bieng punished forthe crimes never disclosed
? by not knowing the reason fo tyhe condemned convicts
' presence onthe e
- block
, the audience never gets the sence ofthe the justice whihc isnt being carried out
, makeing tghe death penalty apear cruel
and unwarranted
. this is especially true druing the gruesome depiction of hte second execution which wass horribly botched
. much has also been made of coffey
' s christ
- like ability tothe heal bu unlike the numberous healings hwihc are recorded infact thge scriptures
, coffey
' s powers are shrouded infact mystery
, tkaing onthe tjhe fiel of a carcus trck
, coupled withthe a voodoo
- like
" i feel your pain
" transference
. in contrast
, there is no mystery asociated wih the healing that is from god
. yhe genuine
" gifts of healing
" listed infront 1 corinthians 12 isnt jsut oen ofthe the nine manisfestations of wholy spirit adn cant be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman inaddition accordance withthe tjhe knowledge
and wisdom ofthe god
. true spiritual healing
( wih few exceptions
) requires teh committde believing of both teh healer as well as the oney bieng healed
. such believing comes nto from the shrouded secrets ofthe mysticism
,
but from the revealed owrd ofthe god
.
