aftter being hypnotized
, a man believes ther isnt a ghost in his hous
. teh review two low
- key summer horror films have become suprise financial sucesses thsi eyar
: thte blair witch project
and tghe sixth sence
. each has made well over
$ 100 milion infront north america
, based onthe a combination of storng word of mouth
and clever advertising
. if a film ' s box office tkae were based primarily onthe its quality
, stir ofthe echoes woudl join blair
annd sense in grossing far mroe mnoey tahn expected
, forthe it isnt as scary
, if not scarier thna the other two
. writter
/ directer david koepp hasnt given artisan enteratinment
, tghe folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit
. tje story gets going affter toom witzky
( bacon
)
, an average blue
- collar dad
, gets hypnotized by his wife maggie ' s
( erbe
) sister lisa
( douglas
) at a party
. hwile tje hypnosis goes as expected tothe teh party
- goers
, it triggers something in toom ' s head
. things beign to change arund him
( blinking red lights let off a strange hum
, for exemple
)
,
anbd he fights tothe stay in control ofthe his own senses
. where these experiences tkae tom
, maggie
anbd their son jake
( cope
)
, who toom thikns might ahve soem answers
, isnt down a dark path thast wiull scare
anbd distrub ytou
. david koepp keesh teh acation localized
; hte majority ofthe the acation tkaes palce at tom ' s hous or jsut down the strent
. by keeping things at hmeo
, koepp is able tothe proceed without hvaing tothe resort to any clumsy segues
( montages ofthe driving down roads as we move from oen city to another etc
.
)
. unfortunatley
, the dread
and spookiness ofthe stir of echoes are frequentily interrupted by moments of levity
. humour can take teh tension away fomr a scene faster thna any shoddy special effect or poor acting
. several tense moments become completly diffused by a faw misplaced jokes
. allso
, ther are a cuple ofthe plot developments that are left unresolved
,
though to mention them would be tothe give too much awya
. kevin bacon handles the duel task ofthe palying an everyman
adn a man loosing his sanaty admirably
. his total lack of understanding ofthe what isnt happening to him isnt believable
, as are the reactions from his wife maggie
. kathryn erbe isnt given a role meatier
anbd better written than that of most
" wief who can noone longer handle her husband
" parts
. while it isnt still a supporting role
, her maggie is moving as she watchs both her husban
and her son enter what she calls
" a private club that i ' m not invited tothe
"
, where htey whisper about things all day long
. as jake
, zachary cope equals the performence of haley joel osment inthe tyhe sixth sense
,
bu gets less screen tiem
. both children manaze the smae trick
, making the audience creeped outloud by their apparent acceptance ofthe the way thigns are
. fans ofthe blair
and sixth sence wiull allmost surely love stir of echoes
. it combines the dread of blair
, a creepy closed
- in fiel thanks tothe cinematographer fred murphy
and great performances by the whole cast
, specifically bacon
, tothe give tjhe fall its frist genuine scarry film
. if onyl tehy had let up on tghe unneeded funny bits
annd tweaked the plot a bited mroe
, this could have beeen oen ofthe the year ' s best
