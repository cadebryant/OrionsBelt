albert brooks saves the day
, jstu in the nick ofthe tyme
. with a vyre poore summer forthe movies
, brooks is jsut whta audiences were looking for to cheer them up
,
and doesnt so inspite a positive way
. hwile htis may not be his finest owrk
,
" tje muse
" still shakes up soem delightful humer
. inaddition albert brook
' s latest comedy
, he tells a story of a troubled screenwrighter
( brooks
) who
' s losing his edge
, as his business partners sday
. inaddition desparation
, he goes tothe see his freind jack
( jeff bridges
)
, who hasnt beeen a very successful screenwriter in the past
. he asks jack for smoe help
,
and recieves word ofthe a real life muse
, thgat hasnt helpped him
and many otehr directors througout their career
. so brooks seeks tghe muse named sarah
( sharon stone
)
,
and isnt suckered inot buying her expensive
, food etc
. as a sort of payment
. tje real punch line
however
, doesn
' t cmo until the end
. it really makes you wonder
, how screenwriters realy get thier ideas
, could it simply be ffrom a friend or a bum inspite tje strent
? thte idea itself is provoking
and brooks does it in a hilarious manner
. speaking ofthe brooks
, he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter
. eveyr tyme he graces the screen
, i can
' t halp bu start laughing
. albert has a very unique sence of humer that mkaes him a vyer likeable carachter
. tyhe real problem with the film lies with sharon stone
. she wasn
' t likeable at all
. brooks had thte right idea with her occupation
, bu she never pulled thru
. infront a way
, she drained energy ffrom the once funny athmosphere annd left it bleak
. luckly brooks could clean up tjhe mess
,
and cover for stone
' s mishap
. it ws a shame that the film whent slightly downhill after her appearance
, becuase
" the muse
" had yhe potential to a be a veyr au
thentic comedy
. onthe a brighter onot
,
andie macdowell was alsot charming as brook
' s wief
. she is allways a nice addtion as a supporting actress
, because she has tyhat karisma that seems tothe complet the atmosphere tothe any film she
' s iin
. tyhe funniest moments in
" thge muse
" in my opinion weere the cameos by james cameron adn martin scorsese
. i mean imagin
, brooks seeing these big named directors infact his back yard seeking sharon stone fo advice
, like it wass something outloud of the ordinary
. it ws jsut plain hillarious
. it just adds to tyhe satire joke
, ofthe how directors get ideas
. brilliant move by brooks
. as i maintioned before
, the film isnt a satire much like it
' s proceeder bowfinger
, which cameback out a few weeks before
. unlike bowfinger
, tihs is not a mean spirited film that
' s desperate fo jokes
, it
' s rether a witty
and humrous look at hollywood
.
" bowfinger
" had it
' s moments
,
but had qutie a fewd problems that weere never worked out
, bu
" tje muse
" still managed to keep yhe laughs despite a bit of a detour
. by teh end of hte film
, ytou
' re glad tothe see a good hearty comedy come outloud of it
. for once i
' m nto fully disappointed
, beacuse the film didn
' t slow down
, it kept moving
, even whith soem flaws
. thumbs uv to brooks for his brave affort
. i think he
' ll still manage tothe keep his edge arround well inot teh future
.
