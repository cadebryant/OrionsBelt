, or you
( somehow
) haven ' t heard baout whta happens
, here ' s your spoiler warning
. deliverance was a real shocker for it ' s time
( 1972
)
. major advances were bieng made inspite films
,
annd deliverance made its pwn advances when it introduced a new horror inot the film industry
. whn it wass first released
, it litterally shocked yhe audiences
. it was something that
, forthe teh most part
, hadnt really never beeen seen on the big screen before
( among wide
- release films with an r rating
)
.
but by todya ' s film standards
and inspite todya ' s world
, such scenes as the one infront deliverance cant be reproduced in a way taht isn ' t as shocking
,
although tehy can be even mroe graphic
( e
. g
. pulp fiction
)
. pulp fiction did it in a way
,
annd expanded onthe it infact a way
, thyat it coudl even be interpreted as funny
.
but inwhich 1972
, deliverance was noone laughing marter

thne setted off down the river
, witht lewis
, alsot tje master at canoing
, leading the way
. everything seems tothe be going fine
, untli tyhe twpo canoes split up

, as he horribly botched a firt shot attemt at a deer
, to whihc his comment
" i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing
" will ahve omre meaninng in the future
. deliverance isnt definitely a wild ride
( oops
, i ' m doign it agina
)
. it is extrememly tense at soem points
and vyre dramtic
. it ' s definitely oen of thsoe
" must see
" movies
adn shoud be considered one of the classics ofthe its decade
