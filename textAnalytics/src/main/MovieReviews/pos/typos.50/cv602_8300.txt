' t heard baout waht happens
, here
' s your spoiler warning
. deliverance ws a rela shocker fo it
' s tyme
( 1972
)
. major advances were being made in films
, annd deliverance made its pwn advances when it introduced a new horror into tghe film inudstry
. whn it was first released
, it literally shocked tghe audiences
. it ws something thast
, for yhe most part
, hadnt relaly never been seen on yhe big screen before
( amonst wide
- realease films with an r rating
)
.
but by todya
' s film st
andards anbd inspite todya
' s world
, such scenes as the noe in deliverance cxan be reproduced in a way that isn
' t as shocking
, altough they can be even omre graphic
( e
. g
. pulp fiction
)
. pulp fiction doed it infront a way
,
and exp
anded onthe it in a way
, taht it could even be interpreted as funny
. bu inspite 1972
, deliverance was no laughing matter
. tyhe story centers around a gropu ofthe four atlanta men who deside to tkae a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia hwile thge river is still ther
and in its glory
. the initial leader ofthe the gropu isnt lewis
( burt reynolds in his prime

) to drive theri cars down tghe river to the point where tehy iwll end theri trip
. tehy mkea arrangments withthe a fewd mountain men
, who accept
$ 40
. 00 fo yhe task
. drew alsot has the famous
" dueling banjos
" competition wih a local who isnt
, let us say
, genetically challenged
. the men
then setted off down tjhe river
, witht lewis
, also tje master at canoeing
, leading the way
. everything seems tothe be gogin fine
, utnil yhe twpo canoes splitted uv
, leaving the unexperienced ed
and bobby alone
. htey encounter twpo hillbillies
, armed iwth a shotgun
, who captued them
. ed isnt tied tothe a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men
. ed nearly receives hte same cruelty
,
but lewis arrives jstu in tiem tothe frie an arro thru the rapist
' s back
. yhe otehr hillbilly gets awya
, adn yhe men hvea to deside what to dont with the dead body
. disposing of dead bodies isnt done rether frequent
thoughout thsi film
. while attempting tothe amke a quick
" paddle fo it
"
, both canoes tip over
. drew
, who ws without a life jacket
, was possibly shot
and cannnot be found
. lewis sufferred a rather nasty compound fracture druing teh insident
and is inwhich sereous condidtion
. htis leaves ed adn bobby
. ed decides tothe go out adn look forthe the remaining hillbilly
, alone
, witht the bow
and arrow
. tje question arises if he wiull be able to h
andle himself
, as he horribly botched a first shot atempt at a deer
, tothe whitch his comment
" i wonder how anyone coudl kill a living thing
" iwll have moreso meaning in the future
. deliverance is definitly a wild ride
( oops
, i
' m doing it again
)
. it isnt extrememly tense at some points annd vyre dramatic
. it
' s definetly oen of those
" must see
" movies
and should be concidered noe of tghe classics of its decade
.
