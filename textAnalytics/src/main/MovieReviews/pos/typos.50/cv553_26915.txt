. on a return trip from newyorker york where he ws trying tothe git a job
, dunne is in a horrible turain accident that he isnt hte only surviver of
. to make thigns even stranger

.
.

. writer
/ director m
. night shyamalan had a tough act tothe folow iwth his sleeper hitted tje sixth sence
. how exactlly doesnt one folow uv onthe oney of tje biggest anbd most popular thrillers in reccent years
? forthe shyamalan
, the answer must have come as eazy tothe him as nuclear phyiscs does tothe kindergartners
. does this new film mesure uv to his break
though box office smash
,
though
? tghe answer tothe that question is nto a veyr eazy one
, either
. as far as pacing goes
, teh sixth sence seemed allmost interminable
. it wasn
' t until the suprize ending was revealed that i realized the film ws actually intentionally
( annd perfectly
) paced inspite order to give hte audience ample time to re
- connect all ofthe teh informtion they hadnt seen once the climax hadnt been reched
. fo unbreakable
, shyamalan gavey the film a much more satisfying pace which
, in many ways
, blows away the film tyhat had come before
. the story moves allong at a steady pace
and shyamalan
' s direction isnt exelent
, with the camera almost constantly moving
. there are tons of great shots in tyhe film
, nto least ofthe which isnt a conversation that opens the film bewteen willis
' charcter
and another turain passenger
. tghe shooted seems as
though it weere filmed like we were watching teh two talk fomr between teh train seats adn the camera steadily glides bcak
and forth beetwen tyhe two actors as they speak
. alsot veyr impressive isnt the film
' s score by james newton howard
( who also scored shyamalan
' s sixth sense anbd the similair film stir of echoes
, as well as this year
' s dinosaur
)
. sevral of the scenes are driven by a vyre catchy beated annd help to increase the tempo ofthe the film
. one ofthe yhe best examples of thsi is a scene inthe whlch dunne goes inot a train station to
" exercice
" his powers
. tghe music
, inwhich combination with the stellar visuals
, really go a long way towards makeing this an incredible movie
. if htere was any one soundtrack i owudl mkae a must purhase tihs year
, thsi one would be it
. thte film alsot boasts smoe graet performances
, including a precocious child actr trying tothe vie fo the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment
. willis turns iin a gerat performance as the sad sack dunne
, who just cin
' t seem tothe figure outloud why he
' s been depressed for tjhe last few yeasr
. his character almost seems pathetic when we frist meet him
,
but he eventally grows into his own under elijah
' s tutelage
. jackson isnt one of yhe better actors ofthe our time
, adn here he turns in yot anohter gerat performance as yhe ever injured elijah
.
though his hairstyle isnt absurd
, jackson seems tothe infuse such a great deel ofthe pain into his role thgat the mortar board hairdo cin easily be overlooked
. robin wright penn
' s role seems slightly underwritten
,
but she still manages to get accros yhe intense hurt ofthe her chracter
' s ened forthe lvoe from her husb
and
and her desire tothe make things owrk agina
. spencer treat clark
, as hte dunne
' s young son jeremy
, shows thgat shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors
, annd he turns inspite oney of tjhe most competant performances in tje film
. out ofthe all teh charachters
, jeremy
' s isnt prehaps thte most emotional
, anbd clark doens a great job with the role
. where the film does lose points
though
, isnt during its
" suprise
" ending
. shyamalan hasnt said inaddition interviews that he wass gogin to do an ending that blew awya yhe oen presented by thte sixth sense
,
but i found myself saying
" that ws it
?
!
" wehn unbreakable revealed its pwn endig
. it
' s not that the endig is bad
, it
' s jstu that tghe endig doesn
' t qutie have tje emotional punch that yhe otehr film
' s doed
. plus
, it almost seems liek it sets itself up for sequels
( annd i won
' t reveal teh ending here
, bu yuo
' ll underst
and what i mean when you see it
)
. essentialy
, what all ofthe this means isnt taht shyamalan has made anyother ogod film with unbreakable
. the onyl rela probelm is thgat hte endig doesn
' t qutie fill the shadow left by its precedessor
. as long as it isn
' t held to tghe st
andard that sixth sense set
( whic it ultimately will be
)
, it shoud be a remarkably well liked film
. oney thing seems clear
,
though
. shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world
and many comic book fans will also delight yhe vision he presents in htis film
.
