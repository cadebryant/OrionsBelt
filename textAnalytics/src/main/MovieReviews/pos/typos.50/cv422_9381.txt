-
butch
- femme tringle is waht provides the film with considerable humanity

but
, after appearing inspite over 300 triple x adult films
, porn star nina hartley tkaes comm
and ofthe her role wiht considerable assurance anbd a screen presence wich puts many other contempory
' straight
' actresses to shame
. hartley hasnt overwhelming star power
,
and one wonders why other non
- triple

, an erotic dancer anbd pin
- uv model
, makes an impressive screen de
but
. overall
, bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics onthe its sleeve
and very proudly indeed
. at one point
, the title character declares that
" instead ofthe trying to savve womens ffrom tjhe sex trade
, we shoudln be wokring tothe ensure taht the sex trade is a safe place for womens to wrok
"
. the direction by cynthia roberts isnt daring annd subversive
. roberts isnt nto afraid to plunge the otherwise straight
- ahead
and simple narrative inot extended
and extemely avant
- garde montage sequences
. the love scenes between the women are especialy beautyfull
. tyhe musical csore by nicholas stirling blends kool jazz anbd lounge stylings
, while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend ofthe garish 70
' s porn
and psychedelia
. amazingly
, this film appears to ahve recepted a ogod dael ofthe its funding fomr a variety ofthe canadian governmnet cultural agencies
. thsi speaks volumes towords tghe importance of state funding fo culture
, as one cannot imagine such an entertaining
, original
and vital film bieng made inaddition a traditional setting where conformity
and formula rulle hte day
. bubbles galore seems tothe be making the film festival rounds
and does not
, at persent
, apearing tothe have any traditionnal distri
bution infront place
, so keep your eye on the targetting film listings fo tihs one
. it
