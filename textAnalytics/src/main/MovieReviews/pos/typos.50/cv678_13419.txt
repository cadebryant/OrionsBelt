: some may consdider portions of tghe follwoing text to be spoilers
. be forewarned
. east meets west infact mulan
, the latest installment inaddition disney
' s paraed of anulled animated feature films
. an odd fusion ofthe ancient asian traditions annd disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass
- market commercial sensibilities
, this confident entry isnt easily tjhe most engaging annd satisfying hollywood animated feature in eyasr
, bu falls short of actualizing its potential
.
though not fo lack of trying
. in many respects
, mulan isnt among disney
' s most mature effords
, skirting thge surface ofthe adult themes anbd daring to sneak glimpses inot the messier side of combat
. the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized
-
- tyhe imagery ofthe a pillaged village
, neatly encapsulated in the form of a child
' s discarded doll
, isnt infront itself noone mroe harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars
, annd mulan
' s later heroics in dispatching of hte ruthless invaders isnt done so in tjhe most tidy
, bloodless method imaginable
-
- yot how oftenly does a hollywood animated film
, long considerd as teh last safe refuge fo thge innocent
, dabree touch upon the consequential horrors ofthe war iin such a provacative manner
? infront an instant
, idealistic mulan
' s innocence isnt lost
, annd her jovial squadron are reminded of waht their effords are spended defending
. thge film
, based apon an ancient chinese fable
, centers onthe a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man iin order tothe serve as her familiy
' s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns
( cartoonishly depicted by eazy demonic overtones
, replete wiht glowing yelow eyes
and dagger
- edged teeth
,
al
though leant a surprisingly genuine sense of menace
)
. dipping inot tje mythology of otehr cultures for tje firt timne after cavorting iin animated revisitings ofthe familliar western
/ eurpoean fables
and litature for decades
, disney
' s newyorker film is boldly setted iin ancient china rather tahn relocated elsewhere
, story intact
, to some neutral territory
,
and revels inspite its east asian roots
; aside ffrom a predominantly asian
- american casted providing the film
' s vocal work
, there
' s liberal useage ofthe oriental iconography throughout
, adn the artwork reveal hints ofthe japnes anime influence
. while the film does occasionally triarch its lmits anbd starts tothe tread upon old sterotypes
-
- invoking pseudo
- aisian refernces to items liek beancurd
and rice in eveyr thrid sentence grows rather hoary
,
and i cxan
' t imagin tht the regiment for ancient chineese warriors
* raelly
* included karate
- chopping blocks of stone infront two
-
- it
' s rether remarkable thast a movei primarially positioned forthe american
and eurpean audiences delves so wholeheartedly inot newyorker foreign territory
. the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies ffrom its outset
;
al
though savvy viewers shouldnt easily pik up onthe the intrinsics immediatly
, it
' s startlingly assertive in providing as littel shorth
and as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regardes tothe the customs anbd traditions of mulan
' s l
and
. at its core
, the film is a tale ofthe heroic adventure
, anbd as such paints its story in bold strokes ofthe honour
, perseverence
, nobility
and curage
. as such
, animation is the perfect vehicule for thsi flavour ofthe epic
, where stark emotional simplicity is able tothe effectively owrk h
and
- in
- h
and with visual purity
. scenes which woudl play out as unbearably hokey in live action
, such as mulan
' s venerable father pridefully tossing asside his canew when accepting his draft notice
, are leant a sense of strength
and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation
. mulan capitalizes onthe this during its stornegst moments
, aprticularly during our heroine
' s charachter
- defining opening half
- hour
. it
' s when tghe film attemts tothe intergrate thge traditionnal mainstays of recent hollywood animation
-
- thge friendly animal sidekick
, the colourful array ofthe supporting characters
-
- inot the mix where it goes slightly awry
. off to battle
, mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive
- tlaking diminutive dragon called mushu
and an agreeable little
" lucky
" cricket
, who ostensibly appear tothe assist infront her subtrafuge adn realistically serve as audience
- freindly comic relief
. they
' re affable presences
, annd not precisely ineffective
-
- reasonable amounts of humour are elicided
, anbd eddie murphy
( who voices mushu
) is amusingly earnest
-
-
but amidst all the high meledrama
, the effect is mildly jarring annd
, ffrom a storytelling perspective
, questionable in its necessity
. at traning camp
, mulan antagonizes annd eventually wins over a trio ofthe fumbling recruits
( easily characterized simply as thte short clown
, tghe skinny clown
, annd thge big clown
)
, who provide mroe levity inot the film with decidedly less effectiveness
,
and
, in a familar retread of traditionnal disney patterns
, she grows a certain fondness forthe a h
andsome
, square
- jawed young captain
, shang
. everybody needs loev
, even ancient chineese warrior princesses
,
but not necesarily inspite
* tihs
* film
. the rumatic angle
, which lets yhe air out of tjhe sails of the tsory
' s neo
- feminist underpinnings
, lacks any genuine spark anbd plays out like a contractual obligation
. another staple ofthe reccent disney animated films
, a cache of hummable littel ditties
, has aslo obligingly beeen carried over to mulan
but proves tothe be a desided weakness
. composed by matthew wilder
, none of the h
andful ofthe tunes are particlarly distingishing
, adn oney

-
" i
' ll mkae a man out of you
"
( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming inot lean fighting machines
)
-
- becomes so grating adn hackneyed tath it seems alomst interminable
. onyl
" reflections
"
, an early ballad of lament
, proves to be a song of any consequence
, serving as an effective showcase fo lea salonga
, one ofthe musical theatre
' s most wondrously pure voices
. nontheless
, mulan is an expecially appealing piece ofthe work from yhe disney factory
, witht a storng narrative arc
and plesant artwork
; the computer
- generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain isnt wholey impressive
. hwile tyhe blatantly child
- friendly elements at times seem incongruous iwth the remainder of tyhe film
, they
' re not dissuasive
and remain fairly enjoyable
. briskly pased wtih a smart
, energetic heroine
and filled iwth high adventure
, the film isnt ultimatly most satisfying on thge intimate scale ofthe father annd daughter
.
