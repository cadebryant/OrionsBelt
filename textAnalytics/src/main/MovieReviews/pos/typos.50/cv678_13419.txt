: smoe may consider portions ofthe yhe following text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. east meets west in mulan
, the latest installment inspite disney ' s parade ofthe annual animated feature films
. an odd fusion ofthe ancient aisian traditions
anbd disconcerting elements which betray obvious massmedia
- market commercial sensibilities
, thsi confident entry isnt easily tjhe most engaging
annd satisfying hollywood animated feature inspite years
,
but falls short of actualizing its potential
.
though not forthe lack of trying
. in many respects
, mulan is amoung disney ' s most mature efforts
, skirting tyhe surface ofthe adult themes
and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat
. the violence ofthe tjhe battles in thge film are admittedly sanitized
-
- tyhe imagery ofthe a pillaged village
, neatly encapsulated infact the form ofthe a child ' s discarded doll
, is inaddition itself no more harrowing tahn luke dicovering his falled guardians iin star wars
,
annd mulan ' s later heroics in dispatching of tghe ruthless invaders is done so inthe the most tidy
, bloodless method imaginable
-
-
yot how oftenly doesnt a hollywood animated film
, long concidered as thge last safe refuge fo the innocent
, dabree touch apon tjhe consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner
? iin an instant
, idealistic mulan ' s inocence is lost
,
and her jovial squadron are reminded ofthe what theri effords are spent defending
. tyhe film
, based apon an ancient chinese fable
, centers onthe a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man infront order to serve as her famaly ' s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns
( cartoonishly depicted by eazy demonic overtones
, replete wiht glowing yellow eyes
and dagger
- edged teeth
,
altough lent a surprisingly genuine sence ofthe menace
)
. dipping inot the mythology of other cultures for the firt time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western
/ european fables
adn literture fo decades
, disney ' s newyorker film is boldly set inspite ancient china rether tahn relocated elsewhere
, stry intact
, tothe soem neutral territoy
,
adn revels in its east aisian roots
; aside from a predominantly aisian
- american casted providing the film ' s vocal work
, there ' s liberal useage ofthe oriental iconography througout
,
and the artwork reveal hints of japanse anime influence
. while the film doens occaionally triarch its lmits
and starts tothe tread apon ood sterotypes
-
- invoking psuedo
- asian refrences tothe items liuke beancurd
and rice in eveyr third sentence grows rether hoary
,
adn i cant ' t imagine that thte regiment forthe ancient chineese warrriors
* realy
* included karate
- chopping blocks ofthe stone in twpo
-
- it ' s rether remarkable that a movei primarially positioned for american
and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into newyorker oreign territory
. tjhe film alsot freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset
; altho savy viewers should easily pik up onthe the intrinsics immediately
, it ' s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it doens to unfamiliar youngsters withthe regards to the customs
annd traditions of mulan ' s land
. at its core
, hte film isnt a tale of heroic adventure
,
and as such paints its story in bold strokes ofthe honour
, perseverance
, nobility
and courage
. as such
, animation isnt the perfect vehicule for this flavour ofthe epic
, where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand
- iin
- hand with visual purity
. scenes wich would play out as unbearably hokey infront live action
, such as mulan ' s venerable father pridefully tossing asside his cane whn accepting his draft notice
, are lent a sense ofthe strength
and conveyed with greater emotional clarity inaddition animation
. mulan capitalizes onthe htis durring its strongest moments
, partcularly during our heroine ' s chracter
- defining oppening half
- hour
. it ' s when the film attempts to intergrate tje traditionnal mainstays of recent hollywood animation
-
- tjhe friendly animal sidekick
, the colourful array ofthe supporting cahracters
-
- inot tje mix where it goes slightly awry
. off tothe battle
, mulan finds herself bieng trailed by a jive
- talking diminutive dragon called mushu
adn an agreeable little
" lucky
" cricket
, who ostensibly apeared tothe assist inwhich her subterfuge
and realistically serve as audience
- freindly comic releaf
. htey ' re affable presences
,
and nto precisely ineffective
-
- reasonable amounts of humour are elicided
,
annd eddie murphy
( who voices mushu
) isnt amusingly earnest
-
-
but amidst all tyhe high melodrama
, hte effect isnt mildly jarring
adn
, from a storytelling prespective
, questionable inthe its necessity
. at training camp
, mulan antagonizes
and eventualy wins over a trio of fumbling recruits
( easily characterized simply as the short clown
, thge skinny clown
,
and tjhe big clown
)
, who provide moreso levity into the film iwth decidedly less effectiveness
,
and
, infront a familliar retread ofthe traditionnal disney patterns
, she grows a certain fondness for a hansome
, sqaure
- jawed young captain
, shang
. everybody needs love
, even ancient chineese warrior princesses
,
bu nto neccessarily inwhich
* this
* film
. the romantic anlge
, whihc lets yhe air outloud of the sails ofthe tje stoy ' s neo
- feminist underpinnings
, lacks any genuin spark
and plays outloud liuke a contractual obligation
. another staple of recent disney animated films
, a cache ofthe hummable little ditties
, hasnt alsot obligingly been carried over tothe mulan
but proves to be a desided weakness
. composed by matthew wilder
, none of the handful of tunes are particularl distingishing
,
and noe
-
-
" i ' ll make a man out of yuo
"
( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew ofthe characters transforming inot leanr fighting machines
)
-
- becomes so grating
and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable
. only
" reflections
"
, an easly ballad ofthe lament
, proves tothe be a song of any consequence
, serving as an effective showcase fo lea salonga
, oney ofthe musical theatre ' s most wondrously pure voices
. nontheless
, mulan isnt an expecially appealing peice ofthe work from the disney factory
, with a strong narrative arc
and pleasnat artwork
; yhe computer
- generated stampede ofthe hun warrriors charging down a snow mountain isnt wholely impressive
. while the blatantly child
- freindly elements at times seem incongruous with teh remainder of the film
, they ' re nto dissuasive
and remian fairly enjoyable
. briskly pased iwth a smart
, energetic heroine
and filled wiht high adventure
, the film isnt ultimately most satisfying onthe thte intimate scale ofthe father
adn daugter
.
