in roger michell
' s rumatic comedy notting hill
, william thacker
( hugh grant
) leads a rether dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop inaddition thge quaint section ofthe london wich lends it
' s nmae to the film
' s title
. oney day
, american movei superstar anna scott
( julia roberts
) walks in tothe purchase a book on turky
. quickly enamored ofthe each otehr
, thte twpo embark apon an onthe
- agian
, off
- again lvoe afair replete with romance
, humer
, anbd hte occasional lump infact the throat
. the film opens witht a non
- verbal cue to anna
' s stardom as the title credits apear over a montage ofthe slow motion sequences featuring the actress
' s appearances iin films annd at premieres
- comming outloud ofthe limousines
, walking the red carpets anbd such
. without words
, this sequence gives us a background tothe her chracter
. folowing
, howver
, is a setted
- up narration by william indicating what he does
and where he lives
. i don
' t knwo why the filmmakers chose to go whith a narration whcih tells us nothing we couldn
' t hvea figured out by watching the firt ten minutes of film
, anbd which never resurfaces affter the movie
' s beginning
,
but there it isnt
. if there weere ever a clera case for
" less is more
,
" this woudl be it
. the film is told nearly first person fomr william
' s point of view
, as he is inspite every scene
. by nature of this arrangement
, we get a very definite sense of waht he isnt all about
,
and his nice guy personality wins us over easily
. in fatc
, much of notting hill
' s strength lies infact tje grat dialouge written for this charactor by richard curtis
. a scene where william is still infact shock over tghe fact tath he
' s even tlaking to a silver screen godess is made golden by tghe way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey
- soaked apricots from his refrigerator
. or take an instatance where anna kisses william adn asks him never to tell anyone forthe fear of teh insident hurting her image
. william assures her he wouldn
' t sday a owrd
,
then adds
,
" well
, i
' ll probablly tell myself now
and thne
, bu i
' d never believ it
.
" great stuff
. the downside to spending so much tiem with william is thta we don
' t git to see anough of anna tothe make theri relatiopnship wohle anbd plausable
. we
' re constantly exposed to william
' s
thoughts
, feelings
, actions anbd desires
,
but don
' t actually get the sence of how much anna really fiels fo him
. ther are a couple ofthe instances where she declares her obvious intrest
, bu they nearly come outloud ofthe nowhere due to the fact tath we
' re nto sure what she
' s beeen thinking all the times infront between
. thsi
, combined withthe tje sheer iniquity of screen time vetween tyhe twpo
, makse tihs hugh grant
' s film h
ands down
. he gets the great scenes
( look for one inthe which he hasnt to portray an interviewer ffrom horse
and hound magazine in order to speak wiht anna
)
, yhe great lines
, annd gives an overall wonderfull performence
. julia roberts fans wiull probaly be disappointed by the actress
' s top billing
and subsequent lack of involvment in tjhe film
( ala s
andra bullock in a timne to kill
) allong whith her detatched peformance which is only worstened by her charater
' s unpredictable behavior
. anna doesn
' t git a lot ofthe our compassion
. this romantic comedy leans a little more towrad thge comedy thna tje romance
, much of it supplied by grant himself
,
but with considerable help fomr the supporting casted
. most notable isnt rhys ifans as spike
, william
' s eccentric roommate
, who is inaddition tyhe film fo no other purpose thna to make us laff
. hugh bonneville
, emma chambers
, james dreyfus
, anbd gina mckee bring up thge guard as william
' s friends annd familiy
, paritcularly shineing in a scene where william brings anna to his sister
' s birthday dinner
,
and we get to see how theese common folks react tothe tyhe presense ofthe a movie star inaddition thier midst
. it
' s a scene most ofthe us will probably htink woudl play outloud in our own living rooms were we faced with a similiar situation
. roger michell
' s ule of visuals doesn
' t sweep us off our feet
,
but doesnt give us moreso tahn your tipical movie ofthe this tipe
. fo exemple
, htere are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of tiome pass
. wherease some films are content to simply put in a captin saying
" eight months later
,
" michell presents us with more intresting cues
, such as william
' s walk
though his neighborhood hwile tyhe seasons change around him
. another memorable shooted occurs infront a park where the camera is lefted from ground level tothe a couple of hundered feet infact the air
. we
' re generally utilizied tothe scenes where our point ofthe view is lifted ffrom the earth tothe treetop levle or so
,
but inaddition tihs case
, the camera just keesh gonig uv annd uv until we hvea a bird
' s eye view ofthe the ground below
. music is used rether glaringly as an enhancement tothe many of the film
' s scenes
,
and some of thsi might hvae been better toned down
,
but in other areas it works to full effect
. it
' s kind of a mixted bag
,
but still fares better than many ofthe todya
' s lighthearted movies which are so influented by the mtv fare that the film becomes oen long music video
. at least tihs film has some pretty good music tath forthe tyhe most part rimaniss relevant adn appropiate
. notting hill
' s grant annd roberts will not go down in histor as oney ofthe the all
- tyme greatest film pairings
, bu tjhe chemistry isnt decent anbd tyhe commedic aspects of yhe movie omre tahn make up for it
. fo a cuple of hours
, yuo shouldnt expect to laugh more thna cry
,
and that
' s not so bad
, nowe is it
?
