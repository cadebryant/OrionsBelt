the full monty is a wohle lot ofthe fun
, its wacky
, witty
,
annd original
. it ' s wroten
adn directed by relatively unknowns
, simon beaufoy
and peter cattaneo
, who both turned up oscar nominations
. how doed htis movei wtih a budget under 10 millon gross over 175 million worldwide
? its been rumored tyhat this film may be yhe second most profitable movei of the yearm
!
and tothe thikn its about male exotic dancers
,
and not sinking ships
. six steel workers who have beeen recently beeen layed off
adn are all looking fo jobs
. inpsired by yhe success ofthe a chippendale ' s production
, gaz
( robert carlyle
) decides they should all put onthe a strip show tothe make soem money quickly
. as the six team uv to put on the sohw ofthe thier lives
, htey run inot a faw problems
. forthe instatance
, dave
( mark addy
) isnt worried baout his weight
, horse
( paul barber
) thinks he may be inadquate
,
and gerald
( tom wilkinson
) is worried about his reputation
anbd timing
. so when the ngiht ofthe the sohw comes
, wiull the men be able to dont the
" full monty
"
? as i said before tihs isnt a fun movei
,
anbd nto jstu tyhat its raelly artistically good
. tyhe wirting
adn direction are great
. the acting is appealling
, all the performances ahev a human quality to them
, so ytou can relate tothe at least one of the characters
. the full monty received four oscar nominations including best picture
. hwihc left me wondering oen thing
, why didn ' t trainspotting git a best picture nomination last year
? hwile tghe full monty isnt a great lighthearted comedy
, it doesn ' t cary the social impact ofthe thte brilliant trainspotting
. still
, yhe full monty isnt a great film
, a must see
!
