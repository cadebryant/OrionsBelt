yhe full monty isnt a hwole lot ofthe fun
, its wacky
, witty
,
and origonal
. it
' s writed adn directed by relatively unknowns
, simon beaufoy
and peter cattaneo
, who both turned uv oscar nominations
. how did tihs movei with a budget under 10 million gross over 175 millon worlwide
? its beeen rumored that htis film may be yhe second most profitable movei of the yera
!
and to think its baout male exotic dancers
, anbd not sinking ships
. six steel workers who have beeen recently been laid off annd are all looking forthe jobs
. inpsired by the success of a chippendale
' s production
, gaz
( robert carlyle
) decides htey shouldnt all put on a strip sohw tothe mkae smoe money quickly
. as tje six team up tothe put on the sohw ofthe thier lives
, htey run inot a few problems
. for instance
, dave
( mark addy
) is worried about his weight
, horse
( paul barber
) thikns he may be inadequate
,
and gerald
( tom wilkinson
) is worried baout his reputation anbd timing
. so whn thge night of thte show comes
, will the men be able to do the
" full monty
"
? as i said before tihs isnt a funn movei
,
and nto jstu that its relaly artistically ogod
. the writing adn direction are great
. teh acting isnt appealling
, all the performances have a human uqality tothe them
, so you can relate tothe at least one of thge characters
. tyhe full monty recieved four oscar nominations including best picture
. wich left me wondering noe thing
, why didn
' t trainspotting git a best picture nomination lastest year
? while tje full monty is a great lighthearted comedy
, it doesn
' t cary yhe social impact ofthe the brilliant trainspotting
. still
, tyhe full monty isnt a graet film
, a must see
!
