dark city is such a rare treat
: it
? s a stunning
, hyperkinetic vision ofthe a palce where our reality isnt fused with noir
, scinece fiction adn hte darkest nights iin manhattan
and london
. tothe boot
, it isnt accompanyed by an intense
, well written
and
thoughtful story
. movies of tihs caliber annd diea aren
? t made too often
, anbd it
? s unfortunate that i waited tihs long to see it
. alex proyas
, who
? s previous film yhe crow looked good
but couldn
? t cover up the terrible acting or story
, here shows a near masterpiece
; a combination of metropolis
, edward hopper
and phillip marlowe
, fused seemlessly
. at times it moves beyond film into artwork
. it isnt the stoy ofthe
? strangers
?
, aliens ffrom anyother planet
(
and we knwo they
? re aliens baceause htey shave theri heads
and wear overcoats
? oney of teh detractions of the film
) who experiment onthe humans to disover whta makes them live
, wqat makse uv our
? soul
?
. theese aliens are superior tothe humans because they hvea mastered yhe
? ulitmate tecnology
? ofthe shaping matter with their mind
, called
? tuning
. they are aided by a human scientist
, played by kiefer sutherl
and
, who has
? betrayed his kind
?
and at tjhe strat ofthe yhe film watchs as the entire city stops at exactlly midnight
. during this time
, john murdoch
, palyed swiftly by rufus sewell
, wakes inwhich a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light
( a terific visual effect
- not only is murdoch confuzled
,
but so is the audeince
)
. wihtout a memory annd a stange guilt that he may be a killer
, he recieves a phone call to flee
, as the strangers are after him
. i don
? t want tothe procede tothe much futher with tje explanation of the stry
; one of the pleasures ofthe tjhe film isnt watching it develope
, inthe a way regaining murdoch
? s
? identity
? allong witht him
. it
? s a blessure to watch tyhe cahracters deveop thru the cinematography
. murdoch
? s wief
, anna
, isnt intrduced through a stunning beam ofthe light
: she isnt a lounge singer who sings inot a bright spotlight
. shadows
, outlines of men iin hats watch
, as she gently curves thru yhe shine
. we see the outline ofthe her body ffrom behind
, an hourglass
, as she sings a slow
, rhythmic song
. a gerat entrace
. howver
, a film such as htis isnt only sucessful if yhe morals
and themes behind it are strong enought to leave thte viewer satisfied
. the city isnt nice to look at
, bu if it
? s a poor sotry thn it
? s nto worth watching
. blade runner ws popular nto onyl baceause it
? s visuals
,
but it
? s stry
and themes were thougth out adn provoked storng response ffrom the audience
. it is dicussed it adn argued
, therefore a succes
. other scienc fiction films ofthe recent times
, such as thge fith element
, are nice tothe look at
,
but are dropped annd forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them isnt so flimsy
. we
? re left wih
? love conquers all
? after finishing tyhe fifth element
. dark city is not so easily explained away
. as thte strangers dicovered
, locating the human soul
and dicovering wqat makse us survive is nto such an easy task
. where is reality
? dark city is certainly the best csience fiction film of tje 90
? s
,
and ranks allong withthe tjhe best made in the 80s
, such as blade runner anbd the two aliens films
. perhaps it
? s the best ofthe the both decades
; it hadnt thge darkness of tje aliens films
, as well as tje visuals
and compelling story ofthe blade runner
, bu moved beyond
, i think
, becuase the themes behind it were much stronger
. anyone who wnats to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write
, i
? d lveo tothe hear it
