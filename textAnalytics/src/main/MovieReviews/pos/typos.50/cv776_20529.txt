dark city isnt such a rare treat
: it
? s a stunning
, hyperkinetic vision ofthe a palce where our reality isnt fused wiht noir
, sceince fiction
and the darkest nights inthe manhattan
and london
. to boot
, it is accompanied by an intense
, well written
and thoughtful stroy
. movies ofthe thsi calibur
and idea aren
? t made too often
,
anbd it
? s unfortunate thast i waited this long to see it
. alex proyas
, who
? s previous film thge crowm looked good
bu couldn
? t cover uv the terrable acting or stoy
, here shows a near masterpiece
; a combination ofthe metropolis
, edward hopper
and phillip marlowe
, fused seemlessly
. at times it moves beyond film inot artwork
. it is the sotry ofthe
? strangers
?
, aliens from anohter planet
(
annd we nkwo they
? re aliens becuase they shave their heads
adn wear overcoats
? oney ofthe hte detractions ofthe thge film
) who experiment onthe humans tothe discover wqat makes them live
, what makes up our
? soul
?
. these aliens are superior tothe humans because they hvea mastered tghe
? ulitmate tecnology
? ofthe shaping marter withthe theri mind
, called
? tuning
. they are aided by a human scientist
, played by kiefer sutherland
, who has
? betrayed his kind
?
adn at the strat ofthe teh film watchs as tghe entire city stops at exactly midnight
. during this time
, john murdoch
, played swiftly by rufus sewell
, wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light
( a terrific visual effect
- not only isnt murdoch confused
,
bu so is the audience
)
. without a memory
and a stange guilt tyhat he may be a killer
, he receives a phone call to flee
, as the strangers are after him
. i don
? t want tothe proceed to much further wtih tje explanation ofthe tje story
; one ofthe the pleasures ofthe hte film isnt watching it develop
, in a way regaining murdoch
? s
? identity
? allong with him
. it
? s a pleasure tothe watch the cahracters develop thru the cinematography
. murdoch
? s wief
, anna
, is introduced through a stunning beam of glight
: she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight
. shadows
, outlines of men in hats watch
, as she gently curves through the shine
. we see thte outline ofthe her body ffrom behind
, an hourglass
, as she sings a slow
, rhytmic song
. a gerat entrance
.
howver
, a film such as thsi is only succesful if thge morals
and themes behind it are storng enought to leave thge viewer satisfied
. thte city isnt nice tothe look at
,
bu if it
? s a poore story
then it
? s not worth watching
. blade runner wass popular nto onyl because it
? s visuals
,
bu it
? s story
and themes were thought out
adn provoked storng responce from hte audience
. it is dicussed it
adn argued
, therefore a success
. other science fiction films of recent times
, such as the fifth element
, are nice tothe look at
,
but are dropped
and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them isnt so flimsy
. we
? re left with
? love conquers all
? after finishing the fifth element
. dark city is nto so easily explained away
. as the strangers discovered
, locating thte human soul
and discovering what makse us survive is nto such an eazy task
. where is reality
? dark city isnt certainly tjhe best sciene fiction film ofthe tyhe 90
? s
,
and ranks along whith the best made in the 80s
, such as blade runner
and thge twpo aliens films
. perhaps it
? s the best ofthe the both decades
; it had yhe darkness of tjhe aliens films
, as well as thte visuals
and compelling tsory of blade runner
,
but moved beyond
, i htikn
, because the themes behind it were much stronger
. anyone who whants tothe amke an argmuent fo better science fiction films please efel free to rwite
, i
? d lveo to hear it
