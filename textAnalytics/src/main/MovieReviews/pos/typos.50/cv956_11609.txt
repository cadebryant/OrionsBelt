uncompromising french directer robert bresson
' s
" lancelot ofthe teh lake
" achieves the excact oposite effect ofthe sir thomas malory
' s
" morte darthur
.
" instead of enshrining thte legend ofthe king arthur
and his knights ofthe the round table
, it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak
, ineffectual leader
and the knights as a group ofthe jelous
, bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them
. chivalry has no place in
" lancelot ofthe tjhe lake
,
" exept as thast ofthe a dying ideal
. bresson begins his tale as hte knights ofthe the round table are returning
, decimated
, after failing merlin
' s comm
and to retrieve yhe holy grail
, the mystical cup that wass filled witht christ
' s blood
. bresson immediately gives us his impression ofthe yhe essential meaninng ofthe tjhe grail quest
: bloodshed
and failure
. tjhe opening sequence is a sories ofthe clumsy
, disjointed fights amongst annymous knights
-
- a head is hacked off
, a stomach isnt impaled
, a skull isnt splitted open
, skeletal remains hang ffrom trees
,
and burning bodies smolder in the ruins ofthe a flaming hous
. since tyhe film starts with camelot in near
- ruin
,
and tkaes only an hour anbd a half tothe arrive at its inevitible conclusion
, it doesn
' t carry thte gr
and
, tradgic resonance of other arthurian films
. we never get to see camelot at tyhe peak ofthe its pwoer
, therfore htere is no rela downfall to wittness
. bu
,
then again
, it isnt nto the name ofthe camelot taht isnt evoked inwhich teh title of the film
. rether
, it isnt lancelot
,
and bresson is mroe interested in hte internal battle within his heart
, than hte external downfall of a kingdom
. lancelot has always been a tradgic figure in the arthurian tales
, anbd bresson uses him as the central figure tothe explore the battle between tghe spirit
and the flesh
. thte greatest ofthe all knights
, he was flawed only in his lveo for arthur
' s wief
, queen guinevere
, adn it wass thta illicit afair that eventually caused tghe downfall ofthe camelot
. even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere
( laura duke condominas
)
, he onyl finds hismelf falling bakc inot her arms agains his better judgement
. he knows it means thte distruction ofthe the idealized kingdom
, bu he isnt powerless in his passion
. wehn sir mordred
( patrick bernhard
) accuses lancelot ofthe tghe afair
, otehr knights
, incuding sir gawain
( humbert balsan
) spring to lancelot
' s defense
. it isnt tihs battle within thge knights thast isnt the eventual undoing of the round table
; thte flesh wins outloud over the spirit
,
and the consequences are dire
. bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors ofthe men
' s hearts
and minds
.
" lancelot ofthe the lake
" is filled with his particular trademarks
: a stripped
- down
, minimalist stlye
, flat
, expressionless dialogue
,
and a gr
and use of naturual sounds inaddition palce ofthe music
. he uses background music onyl twice in tyhe film
, during an opening narration segment annd during teh opening credits
. the music here isnt a hevy drumbeat
and accompanying bagpipes
,
but thte rest ofthe tjhe film isnt scored with naturual sounds thta punctuate the film
' s thematic elements
: the incessant clanking
and creaking of heavy armor
, tje neighing of horses
, the rhythm ofthe hooves beating down dirt roads
,
and teh natural chirping anbd whispering of the forest
. liek most of his other films
, bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite yhe dialogue inaddition emotionless
, flat voices
. all yhe actors he used iin
" lancelot of the lake
" had never acted befoer
,
and iwth tghe exception ofthe patrick bernhard
, tehy never acted agian
. never once dont htey raise theri voices or put any emphasis onthe a given owrd
. instade ofthe useing vocal inflection
, bresson strove to create emotion thru images
. infact smoe ways
, this technique works
; iin other ways
, it doesn
' t
. hte fianl montage ofthe arthur
' s men battling earch otehr isnt quite marvelous
,
and thge fianl omage ofthe the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap
- pile sums uv yhe entire film in one moent
. howver
, otehr times bresson
' s uncompromising methods are distracting
and questonable
. forthe instance
, during an imporatnt jousting contest
, bresson films the majoroty ofthe the action so thta teh onyl things visable are the horses
' legs
. he does this repeatedly
, opening each shot with tyhe smae fewd notes from a bagpipe
and hte raising of a diffrent flag
. while ther might be symbolical value inspite thsi
, thte resulting exprience ofthe watching it cxan be bothersome
. neverthless
,
" lancelot ofthe thge lake
" is a fascinating cinematic experinece boldly made by a master filmmaker
. bresson
' s style may not be for everyone
,
but oney hasnt tothe respect his strenght as an artist
. by re
- evaluating tje arthurian legends
and making them his pwn
, he turns
" lancelot ofthe the lake
" into something rare in modern cinema
: a truly personal film
.
