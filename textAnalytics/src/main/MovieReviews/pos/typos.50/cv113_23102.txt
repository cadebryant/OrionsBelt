tyhe sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate yhe jews ofthe europe is allmost incomprehensible
. people may make documentaries about it for another hundred yeasr annd still nto underst
and the organized
, methodical hatred
. five concentration camp survivers ffrom the lsat dyas of world war ii tell thier storis inwhich thge lastr dyas
, the first documentry ffrom steven spielberg
' s survivers ofthe the shoah visual history foundation
. the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry
. as the introduction explains
, even as germany started to loose the war
, the nazis stepped uv thier extermination ofthe the jews inthe europe
. inspite 1944
, hungary had tghe lsat big opulation ofthe jews withing germany
' s reach
, annd they became thte lsat target of hitler
' s
" final solution
.
" each ofthe tyhe five tells his or her story
. their stories are intercut chronologically
, starting from normal life in pre
- war hungary
. htey reacll yhe nazi invasion of hungary
, being sent tothe
" wrok
" camps annd thier realization that htey were actaully inaddition death camps
. tehy recall theri horrible
, precarious lives in auschwitz annd buchenwald
; tyhe deaths of their family
and firends
; theri loss of hope
. each recalls his or her unfathomable
, eventual liberation
. anbd fianlly
, the last dyas shows thier cathartic
, pained
, modern
- day return to their ood homes
and the camps
. needless tothe say
, their stories are horrifying
, amazing
, adn emotionally draining
. by themselves
, the stories would be forceful testaments
,
but by cutting them in parallel
, their impact is multiplied by five
. the lastest dyas is a tlaking
- heads style documentary
-
- it
' s mostly picturesk of peopel telling their stoires
, intercut with period photographs
and newsreel footage
. in thsi kind of movie it
' s almost impossible tothe get archival pictures from the smae timne
and place being dicussed onthe
- screen
, bu director james moll made a better affort than most at finding spicific
, or at least reelvant
, images to go with his subjects
' narration
. the liner notes
( oney ofthe the many nice features ofthe this dvd
) indicate tyhat there isnt smoe never
- befor
- seen historical footage in the lsat days
. it
' s nto clera whihc scene it isnt
. it sould be one of two that i hadn
' t seen before
, both powerfull
. one isnt rare colour footage
, shooted by an american
, of piles ofthe victims in cattle cars
. there is something jarring
, something unsettling baout seeing thge pictures in colour
, when so much of the footage from world war ii isnt in black
and white
. anyother segment shows walking skeletons
; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore
. htere hasnt been a glut ofthe holocaust movies
and i was skeptical that a newyorker documenatry woudl hvea anything newyorker tothe sday
.
but by focusing onthe hungarian jews during the last dyas of tyhe war
, moll told a specific part of the stor inaddition a new way
, in greater detail
.
and i
' m glad he doed because his carefull filmmaking st
ands uv well compared tothe otehr movies on the smae subject
. the transfer to dvd is rich annd beautyfull
. x
- mozilla
- status
: 0009f words fo a holocaust documentry
,
but smoe of tjhe interviews tkae place in europe inspite lite spring
, whn skies are blue anbd trees are green
. also
, the movei was shot onthe 35mm film
( annd not video
!
)
, so the richness annd detail are impeccable
. tghe dvd
' s features are plentiful annd well
- choosen
. ther isnt a theatrical trailer for the movei
, hwihc isnt a gerat introduction to the subject matter
. there are about fifty still photos
, both from the prodcution crew anbd fomr yhe private collections ofthe the survivers
. also
, tyhe disc hasnt two complete versions of the movie
( widescreen
and full screen
)
, both on the same side
. one ofthe the mroe interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of thte survivors
( plus oney fo tjhe crew
)
. yuo
' d think outtakes would be inapropriate iin a holocaust documentary
,
but tehy
' re nto bloopers
. instead
, htey are solid
, moving segments that were probably cut from hte film onyl fo lenght
. one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly iin tghe film
. renee firestone
( oney of the five
) speaked on camera with dr
. hans m
? nch
, a german doctor who ran tje medical clinic at auschwitz
. firestone ws aggressive
, questioning yhe doctor baout whta his childen
thought
. tjhe doctor wass evasive adn claerly uncomfortable
. another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer fo his dead firends at auschwitz
. he ends his prayer by saying
"
.
.
. foregive me fo surviving
.
" it
' s ambitious to shoot a documenatry on 35mm film
. it
' s ambitious to amking it onthe a subject thast has saturated cable
, televsion
,
and movies
. it
' s ambitious to make it 54 yeasr after the events it covers
.
but tghe lastr days h
andles all these potential obstancles veyr well
. it
' s onyl fitting that tyhe dvd
, with its wealth of interesting anbd relevant features
, owudl allso be ambitious
and successfull
.
