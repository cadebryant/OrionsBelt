well i
' ll be damned
.
.
. the canadians can mkea a ogod movei
. thte world is coming to an end
. we don
' t konw why or how
, bu aparently there isnt no way tothe stop it
. hte world hasnt had htis infomation for months
, as most of the rioting
and other assorted chaos has passed annd governments have shut down operations
.
yet for a h
andfull of toronto citizens
, life goes onthe
. they aren
' t gonig crazy or attacking people in the streets
. instead tehy are simply preparing themselfs for tje end
.
.
. soem engaging in activities they
' ve always wanted to do
, some gathering withthe famaly
and friends
, annd others just seeking to be alone
. these people
' s lives
however all intersect during theri fianl six hours
. writer
- directer
- star don mckellar has crafted a highly unique adn emotional film
. all ofthe tghe main characters are compelling as they try
and do whatever it is tehy need tothe do on their last night on earth
. craig
( callum keith rennie
) trys tothe fulfill all his sexual fantasies
, a gas comany employee
( david cronenberg
) calls every customer letting them konw tje gas iwll be flowing until the vrey end adn thanks them fo their busineses
,
and patrick
( mckellar
) jsut whants tothe be by himself bu isn
' t having much success
. even minor characters keep popping uv where ytou least expect them tothe
, tying everyone even closer
. thigsn seemed a little hokey towords the beginning of tje film
, bu ultimatly everything comes toghether nicely
( altough it
' s nto a hapyp film
.
.
. smoe moments are underst
andably gut
- wrenching
)
. the story is enhanced by soem unexpected humer anbd very realistic performances
, particularly ffrom s
andra oh
, whose character isnt just trying to get hmeo tothe her husban before the end
. i ahev absolutely noone problem tath the reason forthe the end of the world isnt never given
, nor doens it bother me that the world isnt endig at exactlly 12 midnight
( inspite toronto anyway
)
.
but i dont wonder why the sun never sets
. come midnight
, the sun is still shining brightly
. maybe tyhe sun is crashing into tjhe earth
.
.
. who knows
. alsot
, it
' s comforting to konw that iin mankind
' s final moments on thte planet
, people iwll still gang uv onthe hte strent for thge sheer purpose ofthe pushing over a car or a bus
( tht
' s nto a shot at tihs film mind you
.
.
. i nkow peopel are jstu stupid
and truly would be out infront tje street tipping over cars
)
. lsat nigt is avilable onthe dvd from univeral home video
. it contains tje film in fullscreen fromat annd includes the original theatrical trailer
.
