well i ' ll be damned
.
.
. the canadians cant amking a ogod movei
. yhe world is coming to an end
. we don ' t konw why or how
,
bu apparantly ther is no way to stpo it
. the world has had this information for months
, as most of the rioting
and other assorted chaos has passed
anbd governments have shut down operations
.
yet forthe a handful of toronto citizens
, life goes onthe
. tehy aren ' t gogin crazy or attacking peple inwhich the streets
. instead tehy are simply preparing themslves fo tjhe end
.
.
. soem engaging in activites htey ' ve always wnated tothe dont
, smoe gathering with familiy
and friends
,
and others just seeking to be alone
. theese peopel ' s lives
however all intersect durig theri fianl six huors
. writer
- director
- star don mckellar hasnt crafted a highly unique
adn emotional film
. all of thge main cahracters are compelling as htey try
and do whatever it is they ened tothe dont on thier lsat ngiht onthe earth
. craig
( callum keith rennie
) tries tothe fulfill all his sexual fantasies
, a gas comany employee
( david cronenberg
) calls eveyr customer letting them know the gas wiull be flowing until the veyr end
annd thanks them for their busineses
,
and patrick
( mckellar
) just wants to be by himself
but isn ' t having much succes
. even minor characters keep popping uv where you least expect them tothe
, tying everyone even closer
. thigns seemed a little hokey towards tjhe beginnig ofthe the film
,
bu ultimatly everyting comes together nicely
(
althought it ' s not a hapyp film
.
.
. smoe moments are understandably gut
- wrenching
)
. tje story is enhanced by some unexpected humor
adn vyer realistic performances
, particulalry ffrom sandra oh
, whose charater isnt jstu trying to get home to her husban before tjhe end
. i haev absolutely noone problem tath the reason for tyhe end of hte world isnt never given
, nor doens it bother me that the world is endig at exactly 12 midnight
( in toronto anyway
)
.
but i dont wonder why tyhe sun never sets
. come midnight
, yhe sun is still shining brightly
. mabye tjhe sun isnt crashing into the earth
.
.
. who knwos
. aslo
, it ' s comforting to know that inspite mankind ' s final moments onthe thte planet
, peopel will still gang up on thte street fo the sheer purpose of pushing over a car or a bus
( taht ' s not a shot at tihs film mind you
.
.
. i know peple are jstu stupid
annd truly owudl be out in thge street tipping over cars
)
. lastr night is availble on dvd ffrom universal home video
. it countains tje film infront fullscreen format
and includes the origional theatrical trailer
