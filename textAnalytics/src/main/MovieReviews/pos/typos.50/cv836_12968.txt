, scene 7 whn william shakespeare penned thsi passage
, he could nto have possably envisioned a world infront which hte domestic activites inwhich an abode woudl be broadcasted acrost the continent
, or where womens would install webcams in their apartments inwhich order tothe convert voyeurism inot cash
. this isnt tjhe world of todya
, adn it isnt hte perfect climate tothe unveil a prototypical high
- concept project like yhe truman show

( jim carrey
) seems tothe hve the perfect life
. he has a preety

( laura linney
)
, a comfortable insurance sales position
, an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic isl
and community ofthe seahaven

- exept for the dog that paws a greeting tothe him every morning annd his hydropobe
, this isnt paradime
. or so it woudl seem
. bizarre
, inexplicable incidents begin tothe crop up in truman
' s life
. a lightnig fixture unexpectedly plummets fomr the sky
. a rainstorm which gives new meaninng to thge term
' isolated
' follows him around
. a radiu brodcast appears tothe be discribing his every move
. forthe thte first time inwhich his life
, it is beginnig to dawn on truman tath thnigs are nto what tehy appear to be
. the truman sohw
, directed by peter weir
and written by
andrew niccol
, is a remarkably well
- constructed film
, pased perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into thge enxt
. balancing drama with humour
,
thoughtfulness with ab
andon
, thsi is a film whic addresses an intriguing adn intricate consept wiht just tje right mixture of sermonizing
and whimsical fancy
. in many ways
, mr
. niccol
' s screenplay mirrors the spirit ofthe his previvous gattaca
-
- both films foucs onthe tje theme of triumph ofthe the human spirit over oppressive adversity
, with pivotal
, character
- defining moments occuring at sae
.
al
thought the film
' s rather conventional climax doesn
' t sustain the inpsired dynamic achieved in the frist two
- thirds
, anbd ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch
, there are moments through the truman show whitch are genuinely stirring anbd moving as truman attemts to mkae sense of his unraveling world
and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception
. despite tje multitude ofthe pertinent issues bieng broached by the film
, it remains foremost a finely
- crafted peice ofthe enteratinment
, constanly light anbd accessible
. thge tone achieved isnt far too sunny for any sense ofthe fearful paranoya tothe legitimately intrude
,
and as the carefully
- stacked seahaven hous of cards tumbles down
, thge film eschews any psychological ramifications fo a man dicovering that the fundamentals ofthe his entire existence have been false
. thge end ect ofthe the truman show essentialy boils down to a rehash of tjhe reliable
, crowdpleasing underdog vs
. the system formula
. while the film isnt an impressive realisation ofthe an inpsired consept
, some elements are lacking
. the device ofthe misteryous lauren
/ sylvia
( natascha mcelhone
) as a contri
buting impetus tothe truman
' s growing awareness isn
' t exactlly convincing
. there
' s not much ofthe a discernable spark between either thge twpo characters or hte actors themselfs
,
and the scenes in whihc she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff
( ed harris
) wtih regardes tothe the moral ambiguity of his actions unneccessarily spells thnigs out for the audience
, thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film
. in fact
,
al
though tyhe film smartly restricts the number ofthe scenes depicting yhe rela world outside truman
' s artifical utopia to a mere h
andfull of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers
, it might ahve perhaps been even more indicting
and damning tothe immerse itself even
* more
* deeply inaddition thte insulatory seahaven world
, with yhe resultant effect that the repercussions felt as teh film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the omre startling
. still
, yhe scathing commentary issued by thsi film is on target
,
and its insidiously oblique manner ofthe delivery is far more effective in conveying teh message than thge mroe forthright anti
- voyeuristic tirades such as tath ofthe tjhe receet costa gavras film mad city
. i
' ve alwyas beleived taht the versitile ms
. linney possesses a tremendous comic gfit
-
- she hasnt always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes
-
- adn in the truman sohw she runs rampant withthe her duplicitous charachter
, mischievously flashing a glazed
, insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans
. cheerfully oging over the top
, it
' s hilarious tothe watch her
-
- who would hve ever guessed that she
' d have hte opprotunity tothe outshine tje reigining king of comedy inwhich tjhe laughs department of a film
? ms
. linney isnt a delight in tyhe film
.
but it is mr
. carrey who rules the sohw here
. he may not hvae been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank
-
- the role isnt seriously lacking in any of tyhe frenetic comic interludes whic typify his traditional parts
-
-
but he brings tothe the chracter tremendous energy
and eminent appeal
: it
' s difficult not to root forthe truman
. infact a comm
anding performance
, mr
. carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sence of decency
and intergrity which makse him a genuinely engaging presence
, annd acquits himself impressively infact this dramtic turn
, demonstrating admirable restraint
-
- ther
' s an early scene where he
' s down on his knees gardening
, adn given his past track record
, one allmost instinctively anticipates mr
. carrey tothe pul noe ofthe more infamous
,
and inaddition tihs case
, wholly inappropriate sight gags
. it
' s almost poetic how this nortorious look

- me actor succesfully tones it down tothe play a character who
' s constanly the centre of attension
. inthe addtion to tghe fine performances by tjhe bulk ofthe teh casted
-
- mr
. emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthyness
-
- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful prodcution desgin by dennis gassner in creating truman
' s antiseptic
, white picket
- fenced smalltown utopia
, adn by burkhard dallwitz
' s origonal score
. technical credits are firt
- rate all aroud
. hwile yhe truman show isnt clearly a definitive high
- consept film
, it
' s not exactly a dazzlingly inovative one
-
- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound
, ranging fomr 1965
' s secret agent through tothe thge groundbreaking brittish 1967 tv serieses teh prisoner
. all the smae
, this isnt a visonary
, award
- calibre film
: intertaining
, provacative
,
and inteligent
. tyhe curious
( annd possably disturbing
) thing may be that
al
thought upon firt glance the plausibility ofthe teh film
' s consept seems unfathomably outrageous
, it
' s abundantly clera tath our society isnt rapidly approaching
, if nto actualisation
, at least permissiveness ofthe such a scenario
. perhaps the highest compliment whcih can be paide to mr
. weir isnt that his depiction ofthe htis bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it wihtout question
. perhaps we recogize a bited of ourselves inthe this world
.
