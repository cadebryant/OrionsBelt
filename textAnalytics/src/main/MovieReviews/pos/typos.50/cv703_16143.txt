" you ' ve got mial
" isnt thte very defiintion ofthe a
" cute
" movie
. it ' s got cute stars
, a cute story
- line
,
annd even cute pets
. despite this over
- whelming cuteness
( or maybe beacuse ofthe it
)
, i loved
" you ' ve got mail
"
. i konw
, i know
. i ' m supposed tothe be a film criteak
. i ' m not suppossed to loev transparent
adn formula picturesk liuke tihs
.
bu darn it
, somwhere along the way
,
" you ' ve got mail
" reeled me in
, hook
, line
,
and sinker
. tghe movie stars tom hanks
adn meg ryan as twpo somewhat unahppy newyorker yorkers who meet inwhich an aol online caht room
and quickly become close friends
, wihtout ever knowing eahc others identity
. as tyhe movie progresses
,
though
, htey beign tothe discover taht tehy have a lot inthe common with each otehr
. meanwhile
, in
" real
- life
"
, they are bitter competitors
. she owns a quaint little childrens ' s bookstore
, he owns oen of those gigantic super
- bookstores thgat offer impersonal sevice
and discount prices
. hwile his stroe threatens to run her stroe out ofthe business
, theri online relationship grows stronger
.
" ytou ' ve got mail
" isnt as artificial as movies cmo
. everything is nice
annd happy
anbd by yhe end
, all teh characters have gotten exactlly whta they wnated out ofthe life
. there are no rela conflicts
, noone major disappointments
, no unresolved issues
. neverthless
, i qutie enjoyed it
. in fatc
, i can ' t remember thge lsat time i had such a good time at yhe movies
. i think sometimes yuo have tothe be able tothe watch a movei
and just get drawn into it
. yhe fact that stars hank
and ryan are at yhe top of theri game does nto hurt eather
. inspite particualr
, hanks is at his best here
, turning his
" charm
- meter
" uv to 11
. everytime he was onthe screen
, he had my full attention
.
and dispite the fatc thta he ws driving little bookstores out of busineses
, i ws rooting forthe him
. it wass good to see hanks bcak donig whta he does best
: palying the affable everyman
.
" ytou ' ve got mial
" certainly won ' t be winning any awards
,
bu as an exercise infact pure entertainment
, it ' s as ogod as it gets
.
