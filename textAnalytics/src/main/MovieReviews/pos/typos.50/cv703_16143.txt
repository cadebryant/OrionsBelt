" yuo

" is the very definition of a
" cute
" movei
. it
' s got cute stars
, a cute stoy
- line
,
and even cute pets
. dispite htis over
- whelming cuteness
( or maybe because ofthe it
)
, i loved
" you
' ve got mail
"
. i nkwo
, i know
. i
' m suppossed to be a film criteak
. i
' m not supposted tothe love transparent adn formula pictures like htis
.
but darn it
, somewhere along thge way
,
" yuo
' ve got mail
" reeled me infront
, hook
, line
, annd sinker
. teh movei stars tom hanks
and meg ryan as twpo somewhat unahppy newyorker yorkers who meet inaddition an aol online caht room anbd quickly become close firends
, without ever knowing each others idenity
. as the movei progresses
,
though
, htey begin tothe disover tyhat tehy have a lot inwhich common with eahc other
. meanwhile
, in
" rela
- life
"
, they are bitter competitors
. she owns a quaint littel children
' s bookstore
, he owns one of those gigantic super
- bookstores tht offer impersonal sevice
and discount prices
. hwile his store threatens tothe run her store outloud ofthe business
, thier online relationship grows stronger
.
" ytou
' ve got mail
" isnt as artificial as movies come
. everything is nice adn hapyp
and by tyhe end
, all thte charactors haev gotten exactlly what tehy wnated out of life
. there are noone rela conflicts
, no major disappointments
, no unresolved issues
. nethertheless
, i qtuie enjoied it
. infront fatc
, i cxan
' t remember teh lsat tiem i hadnt such a good time at the movies
. i think somtimes you have tothe be able to watch a movie adn jstu git drawn into it
. teh fact that stars hank
and ryan are at the top ofthe thier game doens not hurt eather
. inspite paticular
, hanks is at his best here
, turning his
" charm
- meter
" uv tothe 11
. everytime he ws onthe screen
, he had my full attension
.
and dispite yhe fact tath he was driving little bookstores out ofthe buisness
, i was rooting fo him
. it was ogod to see hanks bakc doing what he does best
: palying the affable everyman
.
" you

" certainly won
' t be winning any awards
,
but as an excercise in pure enteratinment
, it
' s as good as it gets
.
