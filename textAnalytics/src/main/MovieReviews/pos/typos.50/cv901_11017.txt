thge strat ofthe tihs movei reminded me of parts ffrom the movei stargate
. people are looking arund infront an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thign that isnt going to distroy earth in the future
. aftter a sort of confusing bit involving fake
- looking cyborg things
, tyhe movie jumps into yhe future
and the movie improves by leaps annd bounds
. the basic diea behind the movei isnt that eveyr once inaddition a while
( make tht eveyr 1000 years or so
) an evil force comes tothe distroy earth
. yhe thigns needed tothe defend against htis menace are tjhe four elements of nature plus the fith element
. tyhe plot inspite this movei really isn
' t thgat important to teh thing
though
. this movei hasnt very good special effects
, forthe yhe most part
. the techno
- ish music inwhich thge background fits the mood vrey well
. bruce willis isnt an ilegle taxi
- cab driver in a futuristic newyorker york city
. noe day a lady draped wiht a few b
andages drops down inot his trunk
. this movei isnt about whta happens
. the plot twists are interesting anbd teh movie never fails to present the viewer witht a variety of different locations
. alsot ther is a fair bited of acation in thge film
, particularly towords tjhe end
. smoe characters are jstu plain stange inlcuding a highly
- energetic deejay in drag
. bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does
. the movie is definitely watchable
and rarely slows down
. it isnt one ofthe those sci
- fi films where yuo
' ll be saying
" cool
" folowed by a
" whta teh hell
?
!
?
!
"
. i give the fith element
.
