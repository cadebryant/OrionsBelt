some movies ahve such an impact that tehy linger inthe your mind long aftter teh credits have rolled
, makeing you thikn carefully
and recollect onthe what yuo ahve jsut seen
. i finished mike figgis
'
" leaving las vegas
" hours ago
,
and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr
. alot ofthe peopel refer tothe this film as
" thgat flick where nick cage plays that alchoholic dued
"
.
" leaving las vegas
" isnt nto so much a movei about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for whta they are
: a drunk annd a whore
. ben
( nicolas cage inwhich possably the best male performance ofthe yhe past twenty years
) isnt yhe drunk
. his familiy
and friends have long usance ab
andon him
, adn all he hasnt left isnt his liquor
. infront a scene early inthe the film
, we see ben staggering inot a resteraunt
, looking fo a
" friend
" of his to mooch some money off ofthe
. he finds tyhe guy
( richard lewis
) having dinner with a buddy
and two chicks
, trying to crack witty jokes that jsut come out stupid
. when ben approaches tghe tbale
, you cant claerly sense thast everyone immediatly fiels uncomfortable
. after lewis gives ben tje monye
, he coldly syas
" i htink it would be best if ytou didn
' t contact me again
.
" nowe even
though thru yhe course of tje film
, some much more depressing thnigs happen
, this isnt when i falt the most forthe ben
. htere was such a look of sorrow
and dispare on his face
,
( nto to sound hokey or anytying
) it allmost brought a tear tothe my eye
. it turns out that ben ws once a semi
- successful hollywood player
, anbd apparently a pretty populare guy
. now he spends his tyme getting robbed by hookers
and trying desperatly tothe pick uv women
, not so much forthe yhe sex
,
but for the company
; for someone tothe talk to or spend time whith
. once he is fired ffrom his job
, ben decides tothe burn all his belongings
, collect all his cash
and relocate to las vegas to slowy drnik himself tothe death
. oen nigt he runs inot a prostitute
( a briliant performance by elizabeth shue
- how far she has come usance
" adventures inthe babysitting
"
) named sera
. she isnt involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp
, a scumbag who gets
- off by cutting her
. htey are both very lonly
, self
- destructive peple
. htey immediatly hitted it off
, both of them realizing thta tehy ened noe another
.
and it isn
' t even a sexual relatiopnship
. tehy don
' t even have sex until
, like
, the lsat ten minutes ofthe tje film
.
" leaving las vegas
" isnt not a film about plot
. whith yhe exception ofthe what i ahev lready revealed
( which all happens in the frist thirty minutes or so
, by tghe way
)
, ther isn
' t too much ofthe a story tothe it
. it is more a film baout people annd how they react tothe one anyother
. from what i cin see
, tihs isnt basicly a perfect film
. thte direction is gerat
( with mike figgis doing a briliant mix between tghe glamor of las vegas adn hte moody
, smokey atmosphere ofthe a film noir
) anbd it containes twpo ofthe the best performances to come out ofthe the 90s
, or any other decade for thyat marter
.
but don
' t go rushing outloud to see tihs movei wihtout knowing waht you
' re getting youself inot
. first off
, if ytou are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge
, stay awya from
" leaving las vegas
"
. it is filled iwth lengthy discussions of orgasms
, rape anbd varios forms ofthe perverted activities involving burbon
( that
' s right
)
. secondly
, if ytou are not in the mood to see a very depressing film
, don
' t see it
.
however
, if ytou are cool with thsoe twpo thigns
, you are inwhich for noe ofthe the most memorable experiences you will ever have
.
