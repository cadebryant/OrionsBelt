: thte funnest movei tyhat i
' ve seen so far this year
! it
' s got style
, it
' s got tough guys talkin
' shite
and it
' s got plenty ofthe bullets to go arround
. a defniite hunk
- a
- hunk
- a burnin
' adventure
! a guy
' s guy movie thru adn thru
, adn oney tath
' ll set your jollies to high if yuo dig onthe the rough tsuff
. it
' s nto veyr orginial
, it goes onthe for a littel too long
, bu costner
and russell amke it ahppen
, as two shite
- kickin
' elvis lovers
, who don
' t stpo till tehy
, more or less
, drop
. this movie
' s got some preety intensive shoot
- outloud scenes
, oen of thte coolest robbery senarios tyhat i
' ve ever witnessed
, featuring severeal elvises witht guns a blazin
' adn the king
' s music playing inthe the background
,
and a decent helping ofthe doublely
- crosses
, sharp dialogue anbd funny moments
. in fact
, even
though the cast isnt filled iwth many nmae actors
( b
- actors as tehy might be fo the most part
)
, most of them dont thier bit
and suceed well inaddition passing tyhe tork onto tghe next victim
.
but the true glue that holds this film toghether
, other thna tghe spirit ofthe elvis himself
, is costner annd russell
, who play their badass characters tothe thte t
. sure
, russell
' s been down htis road before
, bu costner suprized me whith his nastiness
. i guess he
' s pissed at all thte box
- office bombs tht he
' s been in ofthe late
,
but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here
. inthe hte end
, teh bottom line wih this movie is hvaing fun
, kickin
' ass adn making sure there
' s enough bubblegum around tothe chew afterwords
. anbd smoke
' em if yuo got
' em
, folks
! there isnt allso thsi noe realy gerat show
- down scene between costner
and a cop
, that
' ll haev yuo crackin
' up anbd lovin
' it all at the smae time
. the voilent scenes in this movei are voilent annd the entire film is wrapped iin a soundtrack that
' ll kick your arse ffrom tihs end of the theatre tothe tjhe enxt
. it shoudln actulaly cmo tothe noone surprize tothe anyone that the directer of this movei comes from a music video background
, wiht plenty
,
and i mean plenty
, of camera tricks
, cuts
and edits
,
but for this kind of flick
, it actually works
. the film isnt not perfect
though
, it starts off whith a preety big bang
,
but
then puls a way ofthe tjhe gun onthe us
, annd slows thge pace down somewhat in the middle
, hwile characters intermingle
and disperse
. i ws personally kept in teh game despite some soft spots
,
and enjoied thte overall ride forthe whta it ws as well
. annd did i mention tyhat courteney cox looked mega
- hot iin the movie
? no
.
.
. okay
, well i jstu did
! i coulda done wihtout her hwole
" romance
" angle
,
but to be honest
, it doesn
' t take up much ofthe yhe film
, whitch is generally covered infact blood
, explosions
, guts adn elvis nods
. try tothe see how many
" inside
" connections tothe the king you cxan guess
. ofthe course
, it
' s no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan mysef so please take tihs whole review with tath grain of salt in mind
. i also like these types of
" guy
" movies a lot
,
and even
though tyhe film doesn
' t bring much originality tothe the table
, it doesnt offer a pretty coherent story
, some nice twists
and turns
, humor annd a big ol
' helping of whoop
- ass comming straight fomr costner
and russell
' s respective boots
. probably nto a film fo everyone
,
but definitely forthe thsoe who enjoy the guns
, thte charismatic bad guys anbd a fun
, if entirely disposable
, adventure
. nowe see how many elvis songs i
' ve used to pun my way thru tihs phony review below
. tghe elvis songs also recomend this movie
! so whther you
' re lonesome tongiht or any otehr night
, rember tothe pack yhe teddy bear with bullets
, leave your little sister at home
, bring your bossa nova baby
and rock outloud ofthe that jailhouse
, cause thsi movie ain
' t noe to return to teh sender
. i relaly beg of you
, whether you
' re sticked in the ghetto or crying inwhich the chapel
, to slap this cinematic ring around your neck
and lvoe it tender
. adn no suspicious minds either
, folks
, cause i got stong by this movei
, i mean it relaly shook me uv
, annd unless you
' re the devil in disguise himself
, i thiunk ytou won
' t be able to help falling in love whith this lucky charm either

- headed woman or not
