adn up
, who ' s thge real bad guy
and who ' s gonna git tothe bang courteney cox are jstu a few of teh questions whitch will be answered by the rest ofthe this movie
. critique
: tyhe funnest movie thast i ' ve seen so far this year
! it ' s got style
, it ' s got tough guys talkin ' shite
annd it ' s got plenty of bullets tothe go around
. a definite hunk
- a
- hunk
- a burnin ' adventure
! a guy ' s guy movie through
and thru
,
and one that ' ll set your jollies to high if you dig onthe the rough tsuff
. it ' s nto very originnal
, it goes on fo a littel too long
,
bu costner
adn russell make it happn
, as twpo shite
- kickin ' elvis lovers
, who don ' t stpo till they
, mroe or less
, drop
. tihs movie ' s got some preety intensive shoot
- outloud scenes
, one ofthe the coolest robbery scenarios that i ' ve ever witnessed
, featuring several elvises with guns a blazin '
adn hte king ' s music playing iin tyhe background
,
and a decent helping ofthe doulbe
- crosses
, sharp dialogue
and funny moments
. in fact
, even
though the cast is filled with many nmae actors
( b
- actors as they might be forthe thge most part
)
, most of them dont their bited
and seceed well in passing the torch onto the next victim
.
bu the true glue that holds tihs film toghether
, otehr than yhe spirit of elvis himself
, isnt costner
anbd russell
, who play their badass charachters to the t
. sure
, russell ' s beeen down thsi road before
,
but costner suprised me with his nastiness
. i guess he ' s pissed at all the box
- office bombs that he ' s been in ofthe lite
,
but he sure palyed a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here
. infact thge end
, the bottom line iwth this movei is hvaing funn
, kickin ' ass
annd mkaing sure there ' s anough bubblegum aroud to chew afterwards
.
adn smoke ' em if you got ' em
, folks
! htere is aslo this noe realy great sohw
- down scene between costner
and a cop
, thyat ' ll ahve you crackin ' up
annd lovin ' it all at the same tiem
. tjhe voilent scenes in thsi movei are violent
and tje entire film is wrapped inspite a soundtrack tht ' ll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to tjhe enxt
. it shoudl atcually cmo to no suprize to anyone that the directer ofthe thsi movei comes fomr a music video background
, wtih plenty
,
and i mean plenty
, of camera tricks
, cuts
anbd edits
,
but fo this kind ofthe flick
, it ctually works
. the film isnt nto perfect
though
, it starts off wih a preety big bang
,
bu
then puls a way of yhe gun on us
,
anbd slows tje pace down somewhat iin tjhe middle
, hwile charachters intermingle
anbd disperse
. i wass personally kept inspite thte game despite some soft spots
,
annd enjoyed tje overall ride forthe what it was as well
.
and doed i mention that courteney cox looked mega
- hot in the movie
? no
.
.
. okay
, well i jsut did
! i coulda done without her whole
" romance
" angl
,
bu tothe be honest
, it doesn ' t tkae up much ofthe the film
, which isnt generaly covered inthe blood
, explosions
, guts
annd elvis nods
. try tothe see how many
" inside
" connections tothe the king you can guess
. ofthe course
, it ' s noone secret that i am qtuie a big elvis fan mysef so please take this whole review with that grain ofthe salt inthe mind
. i alsot like theese types of
" guy
" movies a lot
,
and even
though the film doesn ' t bring much originality tothe the tabel
, it doesnt offer a pretty coherent story
, some nice twists
annd turns
, humer
adn a big ol ' helping of whoop
- ass comming straight from costner
adn russell ' s respective boots
. probably nto a film fo everyone
,
bu definitely fo thsoe who enjoy the guns
, the charasmatic bad guys
anbd a funn
, if entirely disposable
, adventure
. nowe see how many elvis songs i ' ve unsed to pun my way through this phony review below
. tyhe elvis songs also recomend this movie
! so whether you ' re lonesome tonight or any otehr niht
, rember to pack hte teddy bear witht bullets
, leave your little sister at home
, bring your bossa nova baby
and rock outloud ofthe thast jailhouse
, cause thsi movei ain ' t one tothe return to the sender
. i realyl beg of yuo
, whether you ' re sticked in tje ghetto or crying in the chapel
, tothe slap this cinematic ring around your neck
and love it tender
.
annd no suspicious minds either
, folks
, cause i got stung by this movie
, i mean it realy shook me up
,
anbd unless yuo ' re thte devil inspite disguise hismelf
, i tihkn you won ' t be able tothe halp falling infront lveo wiht this lucky charm either
. so don ' t be cruel
, don ' t turn away
, don ' t curl uv with your latest flame tonite
( whether she be a hard
- headed woman or nto
)
and surender tothe the hound dog of movies that isnt this film
