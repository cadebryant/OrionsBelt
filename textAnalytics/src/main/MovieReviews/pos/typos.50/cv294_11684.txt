since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller
" blood simple
,
" joel
adn ethan coen have been one ofthe thte most eclectic
, orignal
,
and downright fascinating creative teams inaddition modern hollywood

-
- one ofthe hollywood ' s most underrated actors
-
- iin the best stoned peformance usance sean penn stumbled through hte halls ofthe ridgemont high
. the dued isnt a simple man who hasnt never qutie made it out ofthe thge sixties
. he has shaggy
, shoulder
- lenght hair
, a grizzled goatee badly inaddition need ofthe a trim
,
annd he wears mostly stained tee
- shirts

,
and gellies wihtout socks

, one ofthe those guys who alwyas wants to be part ofthe the conversation
,
but never qtuie makse it in

( david huddleston
)
, htis oney being a millioniare philanthropist whose trophy wief
, bunny
( tara reid
)
, owes a lot of peple a lot of mony
. tyhe main plot
and all its accompanying side
- plots
annd coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here
. suffice to sday thta yhe dued becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski wehn bunny isnt kidnaped
adn yhe dude is asked to be a courrier for tjhe ransom money
. by yhe tiome all isnt said
and done
, walter has become deeply involved

bu deadly kidnaper inthe
" fargo
.
"
" tjhe big lebowski
" plays liek an amalgam of all hte coen brothers ' ealier effords
. it shares theri previous films ' storng sence ofthe time
annd place
, as well as theri send
- ups ofthe movie genres
and political
adn cultural ideologies
.
" lebowski
" hasnt the same kind ofthe crazed caricatures tht made
" raising arizona
" such a hoot
; it hasnt surrealistic dream sequences
( one of which involves a busby berkley
- liuke dance number
) that characterized the ending ofthe
" barton fink
"
;
annd it hasnt the smae kind of cartoonish look
anbd efel that pervaded
" tjhe hudsucker proxy
.
" tje film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins
, who hasnt worked iwth tje coens on threee other films
,
" barton fink
,
"
" the hudsucker proxy
,
"
annd
" fargo
.
" deakins alwyas gives the coens ' films a disctinctive visual stlye
,
and here he does a brillant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in tghe easly ninties
, whether tyhat by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by thte dued ' s main competitor jesus quintana
( john turturro
)
, or tjhe strikingly manic dream sequences
, noe of which involves the dizzy spectacle ofthe watching a strike fomr a bowling ball ' s point of view
. if
" fargo
" was the coen brothers ' most restrained effort infront years
,
" the big lebowski
" marks theri return to over
- the
- edge filmmaking
. it is overflowing whith sytle
anbd atitude
, whic helps make uv for tjhe scattered plot fragments thgat never quite come together inspite tyhe end
. the coens fill yhe screen with lightnig
, setted design
, music
,
and hilarious performances fomr all tghe leads
, especially bridges
anbd the allways reliable john goodman
, who shows rela comic timing infact his ultimely ' nam
- inspired outbursts
and his intense dedication tothe his adopted judaism
. iwth joel directing
, ethan producing
,
and both writting
, tjhe coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity tothe turn our world inside out
. theri talent lies nto in thier ability to reflect yhe norms ofthe reality
,
bu in theri potential tothe dig out the darkest corners of life
and bring them tothe light
. tje coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world
,
and tehy put them center
- stage to show tht it ' s nto just guys like thge dued who are nuts
,
bu tjhe entire planet
