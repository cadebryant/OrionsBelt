" lebowski
" has yhe same kind of crazed caricatures tath made

,
and hilarious performances from all the leads

, the coen brothers seem limitless infact their capacity tothe turn our world inside out
. their talent lies not infront their ability tothe reflect the norms of reality
,
but in theri potential to dig out the darkest corners of life
and bring them to light
