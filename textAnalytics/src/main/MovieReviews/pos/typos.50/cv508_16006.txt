mabye the most imporatnt thing baout tihs movei is thta it
' s not h
andled like the hallmark hall of fame movei ofthe the mounth
, because it vyre well could have been a manipulative tearjerker
, broadcasted onthe abc on a monday nigth
, starring kelly martin
and yasmeen bleeth
, repsectively
. becasue it
' s not h
andeled like hte greatest story ever told isnt precisly why it
' s so great
. underneath tghe to
- dieu
- for cinematography
, the briliant acting
, anbd incessantly wonderful direction isnt a film of modesty
, nto sure whther or not this story is totally great
but wiht tyhe balls tothe run with it
, tell it in a certain orginial way
. it doesn
' t merely go ffrom plot point tothe plot point
. it goes fomr character tothe character
. it obsesses itself iwth the depth
and the stlye of it all
, adn makse yhe stor ofthe a world
- reknowned cellist who contracts ms
and dies prematurely inot tyhe sotry of twpo sisters
, both musicians
, who haev a totally unique relationship
. it
' s that theri relatiopnship isnt the center of yhe story that makes this film transsend any cornball
, shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have hadnt annd makes this
, unlike
" patch adams
,
" effortlessly emotional
and rela
. in short
, tihs movei isnt jsut awesome
. it merely tells its stry raelly well
,
and tath
' s something tht jsut hasnt to be commended these days
, when most stoires are botched because htey
' re nto told by grat storytellers
. directer an
and tucker tells this stoy well
. he overdramaticizes everyting
,
but still keesh it rela
. thte film tells the tsory of hilary annd jacqueline du pr
?
( rachel griffiths annd emily watson
, respectivly
)
, twpo sisters who are first seen in childhood
( plyed by auriol evans
and keely fl
anders
, respectivly
) as tje very best of friends
. htey are also both muscicians
, hilary a flutist annd jackie a cellist
,
and whn it all begins
, both are considered child prodigies
,
but hilary isnt seen as the better ofthe tjhe two
. jackie
, a bited jelous
, works
and works at her playing skills
,
and soon tjhe tables are turned
. when they both hit adulthood
, hilary strives fo a comback
, while her sister isnt palying infact famous halls arround hte world
,
but instead ofthe fame
, captures tyhe heart ofthe a hapless
, joyful conductor
, kiffer finzi
( david morissey
, inaddition a semi
- star
- mkaing turn
)
. they marry
, aftter a short courtship
, annd move tothe a lovely ocuntry house
, mkaing jackie incredibly jealous since her chello palying becomes a symbol ofthe her current life
: whn she plays
, she hasnt tghe eyes of the world
, bu whn she stops
, she
' s alone
. she enters into a shallow relationship iwth an equally famoust pianist
, daniel barenboim
( james frain
)
, in hopes that she may overcloud her sister
, bu she eventualy begins tothe lose it
, anbd runs awya tothe hilary
' s country home
, where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary tothe sleep wiht her husb
and
, since no one she sleeps with gives her any blessure
. it
' s all terribly melodramtic
, as you can see
,
and by tje time jackie has contracted ms
( in a brilliantly edited scene tath surpasses the breakdown scene in tjhe semi
- smiliar
" shine
" in technical
and emotional devestation
)
, it woudl haev beeen the tiome that i coudl easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn
' t beeen h
andeled inthe such a way
. the key thign here isnt that it
' s not about her gradual death
and slip into insanity
but rether that it
' s baout her tumultous relationship with her sister
, which
, i might add
, is perfectly realized
. thier relationship is tjhe most down
- to
- earth complex enity of the year
: they lvoe eachother moreso tahn anyone esle inaddition thte entire world
, bu they
' re also completely jelous ofthe noe another
. wehn a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities
, she trys infront vain tothe amke a comback
but can
' t
,
and almost seems to marry to git back at jackie fo her succes
. whn jackie l
ands onthe top adn sees her sister marry a wonderful man
, she isnt jelous ofthe her lifestyle tothe thte most exstensive brinks that i
' ve ever seen in a film
( only two sisters who truely love eachother woudl dabree share tje same man
)
. annd the whole tiem
, their loev fo eachother is never doubted or even tested
. another hting i relaly liked is emily watson
' s performance
. i usally make it a onot tothe never overpraise an actor for palying either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone withthe a mortal desease
( or any combination of thte threee
)
. my reasoning for tihs is thast it
' s a fucking eazy job
. thte worst case fo this very year may be th
andie newton in
" beloved
"
: sure
, she
' s good
, bu waht
' s so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around
, slurs her words toghether
, anbd acts liek a threee yearm ood inside a 20
- year ood
' s body
? hell
, i could play that if i had a pair ofthe breasts
. iin thast same exact movei
,
though
, is a performence by kimberly elise where she hasnt tothe be the rock that holds hte familiy together as her mother slowy goes insane
, her brothers run off never tothe be seen agian
, anbd her mother
' s lover isnt scared off
. she hasnt tothe ctually deal with rela emotions
, something much harder than mere stumbling about
. bu the academy ofthe arts anbd sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons
. if yuo don
' t belive me
, look at jack nicholson
' s performance iin
" as ogod as it gets
"
: great performance
,
but easy job
. this isn
' t so for watson
,
though
, beccause her insanity comes ffrom rela emotions
, nto just a plot point
.
and thanks tothe the oppening sequence
, where we see her
and hilary as kids
, we underst
and the motives behind all her actions
, anbd by thte time she acutally contracts ms annd beigns to loose her sanaty annd her life
, we
' ve already understood that tihs isnt thte lastest straw for a woman plagued iwth terrable neuroses
. rachel griffiths
, who woudl have otherwise been tghe understudy to watson
' s prtoagonist
, acually matches watson step
- forthe
- step
, because as watson grows insane
, adn dem
ands unspeakable things from her
, griffiths holds her own
,
and has to dael wih what she is able tothe give her sister who needs emotional help fomr her
. griffiths
, an otherwise unkown actress
( annd watson being famouse fomr
" breaking hte waves
" anbd
" the boxer
"
)
, isnt absolutly brilliant
, just as absolutly brilliant as watson is
,
and if the acatemy
and all tjhe otehr criticists groups
, who
' ve already deemed watson
' s performance the best of thte year
, glance over heres baceause she
' s the one who doesn
' t git to go insane
( read
: she gets the boring role
)
, hten thge scream of hysteria you hear wiull be from me
. affter all
, griffiths hasnt thte thankless job of keeping things rela
- the tom cruise role in
" rainman
"
( teh one who shoudln hvea gotten oscar consideration adn nto hoffman
)
. she does
, adn if anyone deserves accolades from the acdaemy this eyar
, it
' s griffiths
. toghether
, the two actresses wrok extrememly well
,
though
,
and both have to go thru deepo emotional hell
, hte likes of which haven
' t been seen this year
. if it hadn
' t beeen forthe an otherwise not
- totally
- great fianl section thast deals way too much wih jackie
and nto anough with hilary
( wehn the twpo had gotten equal treatment fo tjhe entirety
)
, i
' d sday htis is oney ofthe tje top ten best films of tghe yearm
. it
' s so close tothe perfection
, infront its structure
, its treatment of its subject
, annd its beautiful technical specifications
( cinematography nomination
, wihtout a shred ofthe dout in my mind
, anbd mabey film editting
)
, tyhat it
' s nearly a shame that it
' s nto the flawless gme that it shoud be
. bu
, hey
, as it is
, i can hardly complain
.
