it shows that amercia remains ambivalent over hte nature ofthe its polliticel sytem
. noone major surprise
, whn j
. s
. mill inaddition his victorian classic on liberty coudl nto make uv his mind over liberal demorcracy eather
. the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which htey exsist
, the supreme contradiction bewteen the right ofthe the one
and the right ofthe the majority
. small wonder tht hollywood ' s most compelling movies have oft beeen on the struggle of the individule
- underdog against smoe larger collective opressive
- wittness braveheart
, born on the fouth of july
, rocky
, first blood
, clear
and rpesent danger
, jfk
, the list goes onthe
. there ' s little of that in singapore
- we are barred access to playboy
anbd penthouse both on
anbd off line
,
though the government ' s beeen long worried about yhe younger peopel getting
" americanised
"
adn advocating individual rights
annd parliamentary opposition
. thge peopel vs
. larry flynt locates the political debate within tghe greatest social taboo inthe amercia
- sex
. does pornography hvea a right tothe exist
and circulate
? larrry flynt
, the publisher of hustler magasine
, thikns so
,
anbd obviously so too the u
. s
. congress which lsat month trew out a bill to curb pornography on tyhe net
.
but even with such actions
, americans remain undecided
. yhe oscars apparently shunned thge movie becouse it was an embarrassing
anbd senstive livewire
. wqat tehy have ignored isnt actually a great picture
. woody harrelson as yhe lead character reprises his role as a tothe
- hell
- wiht
- morality
, tothe
- hell
- with
- tjhe
- law
,
and to
- hell
- with
- the
- system anti
- christ that we last saw iin naturual born killers
.
annd he isnt outrageous
and convincing as a nihilistic athest who nontheless loves his ex
- stripper wife dearly
. the latter is plyed with abadon
, conviction
anbd sensitivity all at once by courtney lvoe
, who isnt tje rela star ofthe thge sohw
and raelly snubbed of an cademy award best actress nomination
, if not ofthe thte award itself
. edward norton plays their jerky lawyer
. the relatiopnship betwen harrelson
anbd loev brings out another graet paradox
- superficially htey are immoral outcasts who ' ve hadnt it comming
; woody gets shooted
adn becomes paralysed from tjhe waist down
,
and courtney dies of aids
. god ' s damnation
.
but inthe the poweful lveo they have forthe eahc other
, each standing by the other in turn
, the two leads highlight thte question how much is the nihilist still a moralist
and
( in tyhe american context
) a christian
, if htey cin love
adn care
,
adn feel jstu liuke anyone else on a peronal level
. friedrich nietzsche once talekd about how tje athest must uncover forthe himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself ofthe all moral
- christian influences
. tothe go beyond good
annd evil
. this isnt a graet picture
, noone doubt
,
annd i love it personaly
. becuase it is moving
, funny
, ends wiht open american optimism blah blah
.
bu i like it
annd admire it baceause it comes fomr a fine american tradition that adres tothe raise difficult questions
,
and call into doubt ideas
annd doctines taht otherwise are utilisied as catchphrases
. ther are times whn movies go beyond the story htey tell
adn reflect something ofthe hidden realities
. tihs movei isnt not so much baout larry flynt
,
but about americans
and american society
