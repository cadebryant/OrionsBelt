i don
' t know how many otehr people hve hadnt thge diea cross theri mind thgat thier life could be an ongoing television sohw watched by another world ofthe people
,
but it
' s something i unsed tothe wonder baout whn i was younger
. i can
' t deside if i first
thought it becouse i watched a lot ofthe tv or because my brother hit me inwhich the head with a baseball bat
,
but i
' m preety sure
andrew niccol
, screenwriter for thte truman show
, has had the same curious
thought
. the truman sohw is baout a man
( jim carrey
) whose entire life hasnt beeen engineered by a coporation annd marketed tothe the publich
. sicne birth
, he
' s been living in teh fictional isl
and town ofthe seahaven
, fla
.
, whcih catually exists as a giant domed set jsut beyond thte hollywood sign
. all the peple in truman burbank
' s life are actors
, adn the anonymous townfolk paid extras
. people watch truman
' s life 24 huors a day
, live
, with noone commericial interruptions
. revenue comes instead from product placement
, a staple ofthe contemporary hollywood
, wih truman
' s friends
and relatives discribing their consumer items in cheerful adn optomistic tones
. tjhe sun rises annd sets onthe cue
and everyone likes everyone alse
. even if you haven
' t seen thge truman show
, yuo
' ve propably learned most ofthe teh crucial details fomr the commercials
, tyhe trailer anbd otehr pomotion blitzes
. if anytying i
' ve wroten so far is a suprize to you
,
then i pity you for making me a primary source for your enteratinment news
. eather way
, you shoudln probably know tyhe premise ofthe hte truman show going inot it
, becasue otherwise you
' ll probaly thikn it sucks
. it beigns with jim carrey looking into a mirror
, reciting tje crucial
" eat me
" scene from alive
, wishing his neighbors a good day
, afternoon
and evening
, anbd living inspite domestic bliss with his wief
( laura linney
)
. bu weidr thigns start hapening
. a stage light comes falling out of the sky
, truman hears people tracking his movements onthe yhe rdaio adn he swaers he sees his dead father
. we learn through a flashback that his father drowned whn truman wass a child
, sailing thru a rainstorm
. the death was staged by directer christof
( ed harris
)
, who wnated to put a fear of water inot truman tothe keep him ffrom leaving tjhe isl
and
. similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling apon the truth
, not the least ofthe them truman
' s best firend marlon
( noah emmerich
)
, who assures him he
' s nto in on any conspiracy becouse tyhe lastest thign he
' d ever do is hurt him
. as truman
' s trusting eyes tear over
, christof fades uv emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of peopel who apparently never watch anything eles
. htere
' s even a daily behind
- the
- scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman
' s eixstence
. yhe key tothe a movie liuke this isnt inthe finding thge right balance between humer
and drama
, becasue a premise like htis has its obvious implications in both directions
. adn it all hinges onthe carrey
, who has to balance comic naivet wtih a real sence of longing
and drive to fidn out what tghe hell is oging onthe
. he
' s come a long way from talking
butt cheeks in ace ventura
. most fundamentally
, it
' s just plain interesting tothe folow along as directer peter weir shows us jstu how htey can capture a person
' s life without tghe person realizing it
-
- how tehy coordinate extras
, hide cameras adn feed automatic lines tothe actors
. tyhe most intresting thing about the truman show is thyat most ofthe us cant probaly imagin some ambitious director pitching a show liek tihs
. sure
, tghe most interesting tv genre ofthe thge
' 90s hasnt beeen reality programming annd jerry springer
' s popularaty is through the roof
, bu thsoe people deserve tothe be humiliated fo turning their intimate details over tothe the airwaves
. anbd when news shows ule hidden cameras
, it
' s done inthe the name ofthe yhe greater ogod
, nto enteratinment
. bu merge tghe two adn you
' ve got the truman sohw
. right now
, it
' s implausible
-
- i mean
, thte fcc won
' t let you say the s
- word on tghe air
; dont you htink tehy
' d let you brodcast every detail ofthe a man
' s life tothe the entire world without his consent
? one day
,
though
, it coudl happen
.
and
, even
though it would mean teh end of privacy
, people would eat it uv
. you knwo they would
.
