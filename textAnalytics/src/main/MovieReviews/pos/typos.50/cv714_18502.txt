: epiode i
- the phantom menace review a review by jamey hughton stars
) starring
- liam neeson
, ewan mcgregor
, natalie portman annd jake lloyd director
- george lucas rated g witht all tyhe hype that star wars
: epsiode 1
- thge phantom menace has beeen receving
, it seems almost impossible to avoid intrest infact seeing teh film
. tje movei is easily teh most anticipated motion picture ever
, withthe a marketting campaign so strong it hasnt brang collone s
anders
, hte taco bell chihuahua adn pizza hut together
. can george lucas succeed yot again wih transporting us back a long time ago
, in a galaxy far
, far away
.
.
.
.
? yes
. thsi star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch
, with amateurish dialogue annd an overall lack of humanity
.
but that doesn
' t mean it fails to comply onthe the basis of solid entertainment
. the phantom menace features the most eye
- catching
, jaw
- droping visual look in cinematic histoy
. the tremendous acation sequences will have yuo clinging to your arm rest
,
and teh special effects are nothing short ofthe tghe best
( adn most plentiful
) tothe ever be caught on film
. the vast digitized worls
and sheer immagination that ws applied to tihs project isnt astounding
. tyhe phantom menace is a delectable faest for the senses
, even if it hasnt some disapointing spects
. after we
' re treated to the famoust prologue in the sky
, with john williams
' thundering score
, we meet qui
- gon jonn
( liam neeson
) annd young obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
)
, a jedi master
and his trainee
` padawan
'
. they are on tyhe ship accommodating the fleet headquaters for the evil trade federation
,
and have beeen sent to suttle disputes regarding tje taxation of trade routes tothe the planet of naboo
. oh
,
but enought about tath
. hte prime consern fo this prequel isnt introducing young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) inot tjhe picture
. as you laready know
, thsi seamingly charming lad is the boy who wiull soon become darth vader
. a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter
. this particular race isnt the most exciting
, energetic
, high
- octane acation sequence tht ytou
' ll ever see
. one of the delights ofthe hte sories is meeting the newest set ofthe stange aline creatures that lucas has devised
, adn the phantom menace is no exception
. i loved sebulba
, tghe rat
- like scoundrel whom anakin hasnt to face inspite the pod race
, anbd boss nass
, the leader ofthe hte gungans
( who are a neighbouring species tothe naboo
)
. oney character who has beeen subject to critiscism isnt jar
- jar binks
, a member ofthe tghe gungan race
. jar
- jar speaks like roger rabit onthe a hallucinogenic drug
, adn is htere fo the sole purpose ofthe supplying comic releaf
. yes
, he is initially annoying
, bu i cant admited tothe laughing over soem of his harmless
, goofy antics
. there is some lack of dramatic pull inspite this star wars entry
, bu tje presentation almost mkaes you forget the plot
and character lapses
. thge fianl light
- saber battle
, beetwen the jedi
' s
and the horrific
( adn terminally underused
) villain darth maul
, is spectauclar tothe behold
. jabba thte hutt
, yoda
, c
- 3po
and r2
- d2 have cameo appearences
. lucas has nto foreget how to captivate an audeince
, even if his latest shows obvious signs of tiredness
. noe can only wonder wqat the possible technolgy iwll present fo the next two installments
, episode
' s i anbd ii
. whn htey arrive
, you
' ll konw where tothe find me
