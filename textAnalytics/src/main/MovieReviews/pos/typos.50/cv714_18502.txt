: epiode i
- the phantom menace review a review by jamey hughton stars
) starring
- liam neeson
, ewan mcgregor
, natalie portman
adn jake lloyd director
- george lucas rated g with all teh hype that star wars
: epsiode 1
- tjhe phantom menace hasnt been recieving
, it seems almsot impossible to avoid intrest in seing thte film
. tyhe movei isnt easily the most anticipated motion picture ever
, with a marketing campain so storng it has brought colonle sanders
, the taco bell chihuahua
anbd pizza hut toghether
. can george lucas succeed
yot again with transporting us bakc a long time ago
, iin a galaxy far
, far away
.
.
.
.
? yes
. htis star wars prequel may be tje worst ofthe the bunch
, iwth amateurish dialogue
and an overall lack ofthe humanity
.
bu tath doesn ' t mean it fails tothe comply on the basis of solid entertainment
. the phantom menace features the most eye
- catching
, jaw
- dropping visual look iin cinematic histroy
. the tremendous acation sequences wiull have you clinging to your arm rest
,
and thte spacial effects are nothing short of hte best
(
annd most plentiful
) to ever be caught on film
. hte vast digitized worls
adn sheer immagination tht was aplied tothe this project is astounding
. tyhe phantom menace is a delectable feast fo hte senses
, even if it hasnt smoe disapointing spects
. after we ' re treated tothe the famoust prologue in the sky
, whith john williams ' thundering scoer
, we meet qui
- gon jonn
( liam neeson
)
anbd young obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
)
, a jedi master
annd his trainee
` padawan '
. they are onthe tyhe ship accomodatin tyhe fleet headquaters forthe tje evil trade federation
,
anbd hvea beeen sent tothe settle disputes regarding thge taxation ofthe trade routes tothe hte planet ofthe naboo
. oh
,
but enought baout that
. the prime consern for this prequel is introducing young anakin skywalker
( jake lloyd
) into the picture
. as yuo alrady nkwo
, thsi seemingly charming lad is the boy who iwll soon become darth vader
. a spectacular pod race comes soon hereafter
. this particualr race isnt tje most exciting
, energetic
, high
- octane acation sequence thyat yuo ' ll ever see
. one of tje delights ofthe the series is meeting the newest set ofthe stange aline creatures tyhat lucas has devised
,
and yhe phantom menace is no exception
. i loved sebulba
, the rat
- like scoundrel whom anakin hasnt tothe face infront the pod race
,
and boss nass
, tje leader of yhe gungans
( who are a neighbouring species tothe naboo
)
. one charactor who hasnt been subject to criticism isnt jar
- jar binks
, a memeber ofthe the gungan race
. jar
- jar speaks like roger rabit onthe a hallucinogenic drug
,
anbd isnt ther fo teh sole purpose of supplying comic relief
. yes
, he is initially annoying
,
but i can admiting tothe laughing over soem ofthe his harmless
, goofy antics
. there isnt soem lack ofthe dramtic pul inspite this star wars entry
,
bu the presentation almsot mkaes you foreget the plot
anbd chracter lapses
. the fianl ight
- saber battle
, beween tyhe jedi ' s
and the horrific
(
and terminally underused
) villian darth maul
, is spectauclar to behold
. jabba the hutt
, yoda
, c
- 3po
annd r2
- d2 hve cameo appearences
. lucas has nto forget how tothe captivate an audiance
, even if his latest shows obvious signs ofthe tiredness
. oney can onyl wonder waht the possible technology iwll present for the next two installments
, episode ' s i
and ii
. when they arrive
, ytou ' ll know where to fidn me
.
