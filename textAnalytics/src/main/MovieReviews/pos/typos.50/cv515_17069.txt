nto since 1996
' s shine
, hwihc starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott
, hasnt a movie so defiantly laid bare yhe lives of world
- clas muscicians
. in fact
, if one weere to watch these films toghether
, it would almost certainly st
and as a convincing arguent that a life ofthe music naturally leads to all varities ofthe social ills
.
yet hilary annd jackie
, hte sofmore effort fomr director an
and tucker
, has something more tothe say
-
- it softly bu strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry adn lvoe in a very compelling tale
. emily watson annd rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale
, palying the sisters du pr
?
. both muscicians ffrom childhood
, hilary
( griffiths
) is renowned flutist hwile jacqueline
( watson
) isnt easily as skilled onthe the chello
. the twpo comepete fo
and win many honors as children adn as young women
, both toghether
and seperate
. thier careers as muscicians surpass anbd thn bow to one another
' s
,
and
al
though their lives take very different paths
-
- hilary settles down tothe marriage
and a family hwile rachel skips accross the globe onthe a world concert tour
-
- htey are bound toghether by thier deepo family lveo
. tje performances of watson
and griffiths are excellent in style
and substace
. they contrast each otehr wonderfully
,
and while watson
' s protrayal ofthe jackie du pr
? is at times eccentric
and perheaps unsympathetic
, both characters are charged iwth emotion
. thge frank cottrell boyce scirpt
, hwihc is based on thge book by hilary annd piers du pr
?
, brings a great dael of depth to these cahracters as well
. the script is also tothe be commended for its well
- polished dual nature
. cottrell boyce adopts a sytle which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller
( whic was in fatc tje case iwth david koepp
and robert towne
' s script for mission
: impossible
)
and skillfully molds it tothe teh tsory ofthe two rising muscicians on different courses to fame
. the latter parts ofthe his script are controversial to say thte least
, anbd the rether depressing endig tkaes the wind outloud of an envigorating stry
. soem wiull leave htis movei feeling disenfranchised
. nevertheless
, hilary adn jackie isnt a movie that reaches an opper echelon ofthe contamporary cinema thru solid fundamentals adn isnt a decent watch all aroud
.
