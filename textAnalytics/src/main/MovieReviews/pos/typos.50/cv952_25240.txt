director dominic sena
( who made thte highly underated kalifornia
)
and producer jerry bruckheimer
( the rock
, armageddon
) bring us a slick
and entertaining remake of the 1974 film ofthe teh same nmae that absolutely noone noe has ever seen
. nicolas cage plays memphis
, a retired car thief who
' s
" pulled back in
" to teh business by an evil car thief overlord
( christopher eccleston
) determined tothe kill memphis
' kid brother
( giovanni ribisi
)
. memphis is ordered to steal 50 cars in four dyas time or his brother will meet an unfortunate demise
, all hwile hvaing tothe elude the detectives hot on his trail anbd a rival car thief who feels the job should hvae beeen given tothe him
and his gang
. memphis sets outloud to put his old crew back toghether
,
but discovers thyat most ofthe them hvea retired as well
. gone infact sixty seconds does thigsn right from the oppening credits
. in that sequence
, we get a rockin
' little tune from moby
, allong with some simple bcak tsory told onyl with photographs anbd assorted objects
. filmmakers cin somtimes make or break a film jstu from its opening title sequence
, annd this one easily gets you infact the mindset for an intertaining ride
.
and waht follows doesn
' t disappoint
.
.
. cage turns inthe one of his good performances here
( he cxan easily go eather way
.
.
. good or bad
.
.
. i don
' t know how he doesnt thgat
)
,
and his mannerisms adn dialogue delivery carry the film along nicely
. ofthe the supporting casted members
, angelina jolie as memphis
' fromer love is infront the film just tothe provide eye c
andy
( she
' s definetly yhe hottest looking grease monkey i
' ve ever seen
)
and robert duvall as memphis
' fromer mentor isnt jstu around to lend the film soem class
. alsot
, i
' m a big fan ofthe wiull patton
( armageddon
, the postman
) anbd owudl lveo tothe see him git a huge role someday
. none of these three performers are given much to do unfortunately
. some underrated performers
however are given meaty supporting roles
. delroy lindo
( get shorty
) shines as the exasparated detective inspite pursuit of memphis
, as does timothy olyphant
( go
) as lindo
' s partner
. i jsut wish smoe of tjhe otehr charachters sould have been as important
. the onyl real gripe i have baout tghe film
though isnt its conclusion
.
.
. mailny becouse you nkwo how it will end before the opening credits even roll
. there
' s noone doubt infront anyone
' s mind tyhat tyhe 50 cars iwll be successfully stolen
,
and hte filmmakers blowed a perfectly good oportunity to add some suspense tothe the picture by using hte
" rival car thief
" plot line
. as it st
ands
, that story line is wrapped up about halfway through hte film inaddition a tidy littel package
. bu if i wass mkaing tihs film
, i
' d have had tyhe rival gang trying to git tothe yhe cars befor memphis adn his crew
, therby making memphis have to improvise
.
.
. therby adding some meat to the plot
. tje finale is essentially jstu a big car chase
, anbd ther jstu aren
' t ways to amke car chases intresting anymore
. it
' s all beeen done
. the chase isnt alsot shooted
and edited infact tath
" jerry bruckheimer acation sequence
" kind ofthe way that leaves the audeince wondering what specifically isnt goign on inthe teh scene
. sure it
' s a car chase
,
but what exactly are the particulars ofthe it
? it
' s vyer hard to tell
. fianlly
, ther
' s a stunt druing this scene that comes close tothe challenging the
" bus jumping the ramp
" sequence fomr speed infact tghe
" oh
, i don
' t thikn so
.
.
.
" deparment
. despite thsoe minor complaints
, gone iin sixty seconds is pure summer movie entertainment
. it
' s not
thought provoking
,
but it
' s shiny
, loud
and fun
.
.
. jstu wqat a summer flick shoudln be
.
