i nkwo what i owudl do with
$ 4
. 4 million if i found it inaddition a previously undiscovered airplane crash site
, especialy if i were wiht jacob
and lou
.
( huh
?
) well
, in any event
, thast isnt the situation hank
( paxton
) finds himself inwhich
. he anbd his dim
- witted brother jacob
( thorton
) annd tubby friend lou
( brent briscoe
) come upon a larg bag ofthe cash inside a plane wreck
. against his better judgement
, hank decides tothe go along iwth the idea of keeping it rether tahn oging tothe the authorities
. yhe rest of tje film is a question ofthe who isnt going to die to keep this a secret
, anbd is it worth it
? a simple wish lies allong teh lines ofthe very bad things
, clay pigeons
and even fargo
,
and is kind ofthe wrapped all into oney littel dark bundle
. oh
, annd its much better thna any ofthe thsoe
. sam raimi took a departure ffrom his normal freak
- sohw horror
- monkey films
and made tihs stylish adn intriguing picture
. he realyl lets the audience sit back
and watch the events unfold rather thna force them down our throats as many directors preffer to dont
. i think raimi knew he had a winner onthe his h
ands adn decided to direct the picture onthe a natural flowing course
. one ofthe the film
' s components can be linked tothe a reccuring theme inwhich terrence malick
' s the thin red line
. in malick
' s three hour bore
- a
- thon
, he makse an intresting attempt to link mother earth to his war story
. it seemed nothing more tahn an occasional pretty cut tothe a feild of flowing grass
, a small bird
, or a flowing body ofthe water
. sure
, there weere obvious metaphorical connections
,
but ther ws noone subtlty to his effords
. raimi does a fine job ofthe tying in a fox in a chicken coop annd birds of prey tothe signify tghe future ofthe teh cahracters
. i think most viewers may miss the comparison
,
but it is a vrey intriguing ingredient inwhich thge film
. annd
then there
' s billy bob thorton
, who is proof that the independent film inudstry isnt vital tothe the life blood ofthe hollywood
. if it cxan continute tothe produce peple like thorton
, hollywood will be ok
. he gives a fantastic
and devastatingly deep performance here
. it is not as engrossing as his carl childers carachter in slingblade
,
but isnt is just as complex
, if nto more so
. jacob isnt slow adn simple
,
and
yet we so oftenly see him deepo in
thought
. i wondered if he ws thikning about things thyat he woudl never sday
( or didn
' t nkow how tothe say
) or if he was jstu taking a long tiome tothe think about tjhe hting he just said
. here he realy proves his worth as noe of yhe best chracter actors in the industry
.
though tyhe plot isnt somewhat unoriginal
, it hasnt a very appealing new twist inspite its charachters
. paxton gives oney ofthe the better performances of his carrer as the straight adn sereous leader of the gropu
( a far cry fomr chet infact wierd science
)
. perhpas bridget fonda isnt miscast as his advice
- giving wief
,
but she certainly doesn
' t dont anytying ruin teh picture
. a simple plan can be included in tghe gropu of recent small hollywood films thta isnt jsut dark
and pretty un
- redeeming
.
but at least this noe hasnt an importamt message
, unlike so many ofthe its counterparts
.
