pulp fiction
, quentin tarantino
' s anxiously awaited
and superb follow
- uv to reservoir dogs
, is absolutly annd without a dout progressing as one ofthe the most talked about
, loved
,
and hated films of all
- time
. infact all fairness
, it should be noted thast thsoe who loev this film greatly outnumber thsoe who hate it
. as if resevoir dogs wasn
' t perfect
, tarantino whent ahead
and improved on prefection by creating pulp fiction
, a fast
- paced
, hard talking
, roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violentce annd extrordinary dialogue inthe a seemingly perfect way
. every major charachter in thsi film isnt represented by a terrific acting performance by yhe ator
. tothe beign with
, hte two hitted men
: vincent vega
( john travolta
) annd jules winnfield
( samuel l
. jackson
)
. these twpo characters wokr together perfectly
, anbd tghe performances by each atcor are nearly perfect
. travolta
, infront fatc
, isnt still trying tothe git outloud of thte vincent vega role
. if these two characters weere nto enought
, there
' s the stuggling boxer
butch coolidge
( bruce willis
)
, tghe twpo small
- time criminals pumpkin
( tim roth
)
and hnoey bunny
( am
anda plummer
)
, yhe big man inspite charge marsellus wallace
( ving rhames
)
and his attractive young wief mia
( uma thurman
)
, annd tghe
" problem solger
" himself
, the wolf
( harvey keitel
)
. these are just teh major characters
. smaller roles
,
but equally terific
, are h
anded to jimmie
( quentin tarantino
)
, a young married man who gets caught up in some serious ganster business
, lance
( eric stoltz
)
, the far
- outloud drug dealer
, as well as maynard
( duane whitaker
)
and zed
( peter greene
)
, twpo hillbillies who are yhe men
" behind
"
( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this
) a vrey disturbing scene towards tghe end ofthe tyhe film
. the film interweaves three stories that
, at firt
, seem to be nothing aplikay
but later proove tothe be vyer critical to each otehr
. the film beggins with pumkin annd hony bunny in a small coffee shop discussing thier recent robberies adn hold
- ups
. the two quicklyu decide tothe hold up thte coffee shop
, unknowing ofthe what lies ahead
. affter this
, thge film focusses for some time onthe vincent anbd jules annd their hit man lifestyle
. utilizing the films unforgetable dialogue
, the two men descuss such thigns as hamburgers adn foot massages before they bust inot an apartment to terrorize the occupants
. tje two men were sent tothe tje aparment to recover a mysterious briefcase forthe their boss
, marsellus wallace
. after basicaly toying wih tghe men
, expecially thge unfortunate brett
( frank whaley
)
, vincent annd jules complete thier mission
and recover tghe briefcase
. htis isnt not befoer a man jumps outloud ffrom a bathroom with a
. 357
" h
and cannon
"
, shooting at yhe twpo gangsters
. he somehow completly misses them
, leading jules tothe ciotee divine intervention
. thsi is aslo thte basis for moreso ofthe the now
- famous tarantino dialogue
. thte film hten shifts to foucs onthe boxer
butch coolidge adn his boxing escapades
.
butch ws orderves tothe take a fall inwhich his latest fight
, bu wehn he doens not
, marsellus vows to fidn him
, whereever he isnt
,
and make sure that
butch isnt not able tothe enjoy his newyorker fortune
. vincent
, meanwhile
, hasnt the honor of taking marsellus
' wief
, mia
, outloud onthe a date hwile the big man is outloud of town
. vincent
, obviously
, is rather nervous about htis
, especially affter hearing thge tale baout a man who was thrown out of a window fo suposedly giving mia a foot massage
. affter their date
, which seems to rather smoothly
, things take a turn forthe the worst at thte h
ands ofthe vincent
' s high
- priced heroin
, dubbed a
" monster
" by lance
. eahc story constinually progresses
, annd new anbd amazing events occurr
. eventially
, tyhe stories all meet eahc otehr iin teh end
, whith pumpkin adn honye bunny holding up the resaurant
, which happens tothe contain both vincent anbd jules
. pulp fiction isnt definitly one ofthe teh best films ofthe the decade
, adn possibly of all
- time
. along witht its superb dialogue
, action
, wirting
, directing
, adn acting
, this film wiull nto onyl latch onto you
,
but it proves taht it does nto wanna to release ytou untli it has sunk its claws completely inot you
.
and with most fans of thsi movei
, this isnt prooved tothe be a rether easy task
,
al
thought at times thte graphic images
, voilence
,
and language may seem a bit overpowering
. surely
, quentin tarantino
' s fame was greatly escalated by tihs film
, anbd he proves not tothe be oen who iwll fode from existece very soon
