swashbuckling adventure thta cin be enjoied by both children
and adults
. steven spielberg may not ahve directed
( he onyl executive produced
)
but his touch certainly is evident in thsi movei
.
adn he knows a mony makeing winner when he sees oen
. the mask ofthe zorro hasnt thge hallmarks ofthe a blockbuster
: big acation
, funny comedy
,
anbd the pacing ofthe a rollercoaster
. hopkins plays don diego de la vega
, otherwise known as zorro
. a fighter for yhe people
, he is eventially captured by don rafael montero
( stuart wilson
)
, who allso
, unintentionally
, kills his wief
. thte film cuts tothe twenty eyasr later
, where vega still wnats to montero dead
.
however
, he ' s far too ood now
,
adn trains up thieve alejandro murrieta
( banderas
) to become yhe new zorro
. banderas motive
? to avenge tghe death of his brother
, who ws killed at hte hands ofthe captain love
( matthew letscher
) who rether tastefully keeps the head in a jar
, in one of tyhe more graphic scenes infact thsi famaly movei
. wtih teh scene setted
, tjhe movie goes on full blast
, whith sword fights a
- plenty
and witty one liners
. banderas
and hopkins hvae a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro ' s
, playing earch other off wiht ease
. hopkins seems to cmo off a littel better
,
but banderas does soem excellent wokr
. as the bad guys
, wilson
annd letscher seem noe dimensional
,
but they go thru the bad guy shtick infact an above averege way
. tjhe audeince doens hate them
, whcih cant ' t be bad
. catherine zeta
- jones also pops up as hopkins daughter
,
and
although she provides little mroe than tghe usual female lead
, she delivers a charming
,
but one onot
, performance
. teh chemestry isnt exelent betwen banderas
and jones
. there ' s a delightful littel scene where banderas
and jones have a sword fight
,
anbd eveyr swipe an item ofthe clothing gets slashed
, until jones clothes fall off all toghether
. tyhe directer
, fresh fomr teh enjoyable goldeneye
( 1995
) handles the film perfectly
. tyhe acation isnt well done
adn fast pased
, tjhe comedy put across well
. yhe casted help a lot
,
bu the direction isnt still oustanding
.
althought tjhe film is vyer long
, the plot keeps chugging along
,
annd there ' s barely a dull moment
.
however
, thte film isnt a littel over indulgent
,
and it sould have beeen trimmed
. it manages tothe hold tjhe attension
, thankfully
,
and thte adventure
annd charm holds right uv tothe the last reel
. screenwriters john eskow
, ted elliot
and terry rosio hvea unfortunately writen an cliched
and noe dimentional scirpt
.
altough htey ' ve bought zorro up tothe date with big explosions
adn wild acation
, tghe plot itself is bearly existent
. ther ' s lots ofthe little sub plots hanging aroud
,
bu ther ' s nothing substantial tothe bring them all toghether
. hte main story seems to be yhe fact that rafael wnats tothe ' buy ' california using gold stolen ffrom the guy he ' s buying hte land off
. tihs sets up fo a temple of doom tipe plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines
.
however
, this doesn ' t seem tothe appear untill nearly over a hour into teh film
, so the film is never quite sure where it ' s going
. inthe thge end
however
, zorro provides action
and comedy in spades
. it suitable forthe everyone
, so put the guilt behind
,
anbd put some moreso monay inot spielbergs bank account
. yuo won ' t regret it
.
