swashbuckling adventure thast cxan be enjoied by both children anbd adults
. steven spielberg may not hve directed
( he only executive produced
) bu his touch certainly is evident in htis movie
. adn he knows a mney mkaing winner when he sees noe
. the mask ofthe zorro hasnt tyhe hallmarks ofthe a blockbuster
: big action
, funny comedy
, annd the pacing ofthe a rollercoaster
. hopkins plays don diego de la vega
, otherwise known as zorro
. a fighter forthe yhe peopel
, he isnt eventually captued by don rafael montero
( stuart wilson
)
, who allso
, unintentionally
, kills his wife
. the film cuts to twenty years later
, where vega still wants tothe montero dead
.
however
, he
' s far too ood now
,
and trains uv theef alej
andro murrieta
( b
anderas
) tothe become the newyorker zorro
. b
anderas motive
? to avenge the death of his brother
, who ws killed at the h
ands of captian love
( matthew letscher
) who rether tastefully keeps thte head inspite a jar
, infront one ofthe the more graphic scenes in this famaly movie
. iwth tjhe scene setted
, tje movie goes onthe full blast
, whith sword fights a
- plenty anbd witty oney liners
. b
anderas
and hopkins have a marvellous chemestry as hte twpo zorro
' s
, palying each other off wtih ease
. hopkins seems to come off a little better
,
but b
anderas doesnt some excellent work
. as thte bad guys
, wilson anbd letscher seem one dimensional
, bu they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way
. the audience does hite them
, which cant
' t be bad
. catherine zeta
- jones alsot pops uv as hopkins daughter
,
and altho she provides littel more thna the usual female lead
, she delivers a charming
, bu one onot
, performance
. hte chemistry isnt excellent beetwen b
anderas
and jones
. there
' s a delightful littel scene where b
anderas
and jones have a sword fight
, anbd every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed
, until jones clothes fall off all together
. the director
, fresh fomr tghe enjoyable goldeneye
( 1995
) h
andles the film perfectly
. thge acation is well done
and fast pased
, the comedy put across well
. the casted help a lot
, bu the direction is still oust
anding
.
al
thought tje film isnt veyr long
, thge plot keeps chugging allong
,
and htere
' s barely a dull moent
. howver
, teh film is a littel over indulgent
, anbd it could hvae beeen trimmed
. it manages to hold the attention
, thankfully
, adn the adventure
and charm holds right up tothe the lastest reel
. screenwriters john eskow
, ted elliot
and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched adn oen dimentional script
. altho htey
' ve buyed zorro uv tothe date with big explosions anbd wild acation
, the plot itself is barely existant
. htere
' s lots of little sub plots hanging arund
,
but there
' s nothing substatial to bring them all together
. thge main stoy seems tothe be the fact thyat rafael wants tothe
' buy
' califronia useing gold stolen from the guy he
' s buying teh l
and off
. this sets uv for a temple ofthe doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting thge gold ffrom littel mines
. howver
, htis doesn
' t seem tothe appear unil nearly over a hour into yhe film
, so tje film is never quite sure where it
' s gogin
. iin hte end
however
, zorro provides action
and comedy in spades
. it suitable fo everyone
, so put tghe guilt behind
,
and put soem more money inot spielbergs bank account
. ytou won
' t regret it
.
