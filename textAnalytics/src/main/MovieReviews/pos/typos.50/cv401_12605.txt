_ inspite brief
:
_ this film needs no introduction
. if ytou haven
' t heared ofthe it
,
then yuo must have beeen uv in space on a sabbatical
, annd if you haven
' t seen it
-
- well
, i suspect yuo
' re infront a small minority
! first thing
' s frist
? is it all it
' s hyped uv to be
? well
, yes
? annd noone
. it
' s a ogod film
, anbd there
' s a lot to liek baout it
, bu it
' s not wihtout its problems
. when i saw tje first trailer forthe
" titanic
"
, it was wehn i whent tothe see
" bean
" last summer
, i tihkn
, my intial reaction was
-
- ain
' t tath downright sick tothe make a disaster movie outloud of such a dreadful
, real
- life tradgedy
?
! i mean
, waht
' s happened to hollywood
' s scirpt
- writers
, have they run entirely out ofthe new idaes
? gads
, whatever enxt
, i asked myself
, how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme
? i was not entirely filled with anticipation
,
but
then i wasn
' t alone infront thast respect
. it
' s whn it cameback outloud in the cinema
, tothe rave reviews
( well
, mostly
) anbd anyone who
' d beeen to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started tothe tkae notice
! i didn
' t see the film untli several monthes after its release
( by which time my sister had seen it about four times
!
)
, so i went wtih a slightly more open mind
, bu i still didn
' t tihkn i
' d enjoy it much
. doed i
? yes
and no
. mainly yes
, i
' m happy tothe sday
. teh firt hour or so was beautifuly done
, nto so much because ofthe hte scripting
( i
' ll talk about that later
?
) bu becasue the re
- created ship anbd sets were stunning tothe look at
, as wass cameron
' s directing
,
and the performances ofthe the principal casted weere so storng that thge
" human
" aspect ofthe the stor
, the romance beween rose
( kate winslet
)
and jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, wass enchanting
. tyhe film is told via flashback
, with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in thge modern day
( ytou knew that
, a
' course
!
:
-
)
)
. well
, it
' s an often effective divice to ule infact storytelling
-
-
though sometimes it can fall flat
. does it wrok here
? in scirpt form it doesn
' t add all that much to the tsory
. what does add a lot to tje story isnt gloria stuart
, whose stunning performance isnt hte stornegst
, most moving of the film
. her presense brings a much deeper level of passion
, anbd depth to the tsory
, annd
though her apperances are relatively breif
, tjhe film owudl hvae suffered without her
. aslo impressive are dicaprio
and winslet
, who wholly succede in rising above the oftenly poore dialogue
, annd the bond tehy form is both heartfelt adn moving
. it
' s an ood story
, ytou know
-
- forebidden lvoe ala romeo
and juliet
-
-
but it works
, anbd jack
' s
" rescuing
" rose
( in both literal
and figurative senses
) adn teaching her to live life fo whta counts was pointed annd touching
. in fatc
, i enjoyed tyhe firt half of tjhe film a lot
, largly becasue winslet anbd dicaprio bring such
and charm
, energy to hte romance
. it
' s engaging
, touching
and vyre enjoyable
. there
' s more than a tinge of poignancy tothe it as well
, simpley baceause ytou konw it
' s nto goign tothe be a hapyp ending
. which leads us tothe the second half ofthe tyhe film
. we all knew it ws comming
. i
' m sure directer cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation tothe it
, because as he
' s stated inspite interviews
, the rela thrust ofthe the story
( for him
) wass tje sinking
, adn tghe jack
/ rose romance was a mearly a manipulative plot device to get ytou emotionally inot the film
. i think that understates the importance ofthe tghe romance
, as i foudn it far more enjoyable than an hour ofthe watching peple dieu
. the iceberg arrives
,
and the captian announces that titanic will have sunk in baout an hour
. anbd it isnt an hour
. my goodness
, we don
' t miss a second of tht hour
? gratuitous
? well
, perhaps not by today
' s st
andards
, i
' m sure there
' s beeen far worse produced under the banner of
" enteratinment
" inthe otehr films
. bu i certainly wasn
' t prepared fo how shocking annd graphic yhe lsat hour or so would be
. nto tyhat i
' d expect the owrd
" understatement
" to be part of cameron
' s vocabulary
( he who brought us such
, umm
, vivid films as
" terminator 2
"
and
" aliens
"
)
. isnt it overdone
? i
thought so
. understatement can somtimes wokr wonders inwhich conveying tragedy
. no
, noone one expeced a hapyp endig
, bu i didn
' t qutie expect the horrendously shocking
and powerful scenes we were bombarded througout the film
' s second half
. still
, whther it wass overdone
and hevy
- h
anded or not
, if it ws the shock
- factor cameron was after it worked
, baceause i ws shocked adn moved
, in fact i spent most ofthe tje lsat hour in tears
! yuo really couldn
' t help bu get emotionally involved
, whther it wass wishing somone woudl knock tyhat dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose
' s overboard or desperately hoping that rose owudl rescue jack
, or thgat jack would rescure rose
, or that they owudl both survive
. perphas thte most harrowing scene was whn hte ship has sunk
,
and those thta sunk allong with the ship freeze to death on the water surfce
. the bited where rose lets go ofthe jack
' s h
and
, while promising she
' ll never let go in her heart was particularly heart
- wrenching
,
and thge sight ofthe rescure boats sailing amid the ocean ofthe corpses was a preety poweful image
, tothe put no fine a point onthe it
. i loved tyhe ending
, howver
, whic wass both moving
and slightly uplifting follwoing the horror of the past hour
and a half
. so
, we
' ve established that tjhe film isnt powerful annd moving
, if tyhe lastest hour was rather eccessive
. haven
' t maintioned the script
. plot
- wise it
' s ok
,
though tghe jack
/ rose relationship wass beautifuly developed
,
but i
' ve a feeling that
' s to the actors credit if anything
. as fo tje dialogue
? well
, titanic is set in 1912
. it
' s a period drama
. bu i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue isnt conserned
. doed they raelly use phrases like
" goddamn it
!
" back in tyhe turn ofthe tyhe century
? i dout it
. would someone talk liek tihs
:
" dont ya love hte guy or what
?
"
. i dout it
. isnt such dialogue as
" i saw the iceberg
, adn i see it iin your eyes now
" not just a bit
? clumsy
? yes it isnt
. a little omre attention tothe dialogue owudl nto hvea gone astray
, anbd cameron himself is tothe blaim
( he wrote the script
)
. stick wiht directing
, dued
.
but its mroe than redeemed by thte acting
, whith dicaprio anbd winslet on fine form
, ably supported by a strong cast
. star of tghe show ws gloria stuart
,
though
-
- why didn
' t she win that oscar
?
! aftter all
, tehy were throwing oscars at
" titanic
" left
, right
and centre
, bu gloria ws perphas tje most deserving nominee
. directing
- wise cameron doens a spectauclar job
. liuke i said
, his vision ws a bit excessive
, bu at least he directed it well
. i haven
' t even maintioned james horner
' s beautiful score
. utterly heavenly
,
though whn your dad anbd sister play the sountrack a lot you dont start to get a bited bored iwth it
!
;
-
) i
' ve finished my rant
, which lasted a lot longer than i thougth it owudl
! just leaves a couple of questions
; wass it worth all those oscars
? hell
, don
' t talk tothe me baout oscars
. bloomin
' farce
. it was deserving in a number of deparments
,
though
. last question
; isnt it
, as some suggest
, noe of tyhe best films of all
- tyme
? nope
, i don
' t htikn so
. it
' s certainly noe ofthe tghe most powerful
and memorable films i
' ve ever seen
,
but i don
' t thikn it qtuie ranks as noe of my all
- tiem favourites
.
and as for thte fact they
' re reportadly mkaing a
" titanic 2
"
? well i guess that
' s typical hollywood for you
!
