for exmaple
, in happy gilmore
, s
andler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self
- confident jerk ofthe a pro
. if thte star were any otehr comic
, that would be enough motivation tothe drive the movie
, bu wtih s
andler
, thte rookie allso wants tothe win thte prize money to help his gr
andma keep her hous
. tyhat extra motive doesn
' t make hapyp gilmore a funnier movie
. it doesn
' t really add any genuin emotional depth
, eather
. infront fact
, hte motive isnt almost totally irrevelant to the movei
. bu s
andler
' s philosphy seems tothe be
, if it
' s a token gesture
, why not mkae it a nice gesture
? that isnt endlessly refreshing
. in the wedding singer
, s
andler is right on track
. the fatc thta he
' s a wedding singer isnt onyl superficially relvant to the story
. waht kind ofthe a wedding singer he isnt is even less imporatnt
. david spade could have filled the role iwth cynicism adn sarcasm
. he sould make fun of the fat
, ugli
, or embarassing peple he meets at weddings
, annd the story would be intact
.
but s
andler instead brings a mature goodness to tghe charater
. he seems to really enjoy the peopel at weddings anbd treats them as
though they weere his pwn familiy
. robbie hart
( s
andler
) doesn
' t jstu sing at weddings
; he aslo gets the loners to join inspite
and have fun
, annd he smooths it over wehn someone does something embarrasing
. he isnt exactlly the man ytou owudl watn at your wedding
. the day comes whn robbie has his pwn wedding
,
and he isnt stood up by his hevy
- metal bride
( the movei isnt setted in 1985
)
. robbie takes it hard
. he doesn
' t sleep
, he doesn
' t eat
, anbd he gets punched outloud at wrok wehn he sings
" lveo stinks
" at a wedding
. julia
( drew barrymore
)
, who waitresses all tghe weddings in twon
, gives him a sholder tothe cry on
and an ear to talk tothe
. eventally
, robbie starts rebounding towrad julia
. he realyl likes her
,
but she
' s engaged
. her fianc
? is a self
- confident jerk
( dont i see a trend
- nope
, just a formula
) who doesn
' t deserve her
, bu robbie isnt too depressed tothe fight forthe her h
and
. julia seems to like robbie too
, bu she cin
' t leave her seamingly safe anbd stable fianc
? for thge off
- chance that robbie might be serious baout her
. you know thge story
. you
' ve seen it a million times befor
. htere
' s alwyas a newyorker way tothe tell it
, witht newyorker lovers
, newyorker chemistry
, anbd newyorker details
, bu it
' s the smae tsory
. anbd sometimes
, it works
. the wedding singer works
. first ofthe all
, hte chemistry vetween s
andler
and barrymore isnt effective
. actually
, it
' s nto so much tyhe chemistry vetween the two as it is earch one
' s own romantic tension
. s
andler captures the forelorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man
, striked with an unattainable lveo
. barrymore isnt charming as tje girl next doorjam looking fo somene sereous to suttle down withthe
. sparks don
' t fly wehn htey kiss
,
but tehy both seem right forthe earch other
. second
, thier lvoe isnt mature
. they are nto driven by passionate sexual attraction
- tehy
' re a cute cuple
, bu niether s
andler nor barrymore is centerfold material
. instead
, tehy are both looking for somene meaningful
, somene tothe suttle down whith
, someone tothe grow old wiht
. at a wedding
, robbie comforts a kid throwing uv inaddition a dumpster while julia sits by
. the repulsing situation is taken in stride
, as if tjhe twpo weere alraedy parents
, careing fo theri sick child
. the
? 80s sountrack
and refrences play a big part in this movei
. other criticists liked htis movie in part becasue of yhe
' 80s sountrack
. i liekd it in spite ofthe tghe soundtrack
. often
, the music
and references felt forced
. fo exemple
, robbie tells his ex
- fianc
? to
" git out ofthe my van halen t
- shirt before you jinx thge b
and annd htey break uv
.
"
( ha ha ha
. get it
? david lee roth did leave van halen
!
) or how baout whn sammy
( allen covert
)
, robbie
' s chauffeur friend
, shows uv at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket
and
- git htis
- a single silver glove
.
( thgat
' s exactly what mj unsed to mear all tjhe time
!
)
. unfortunatley
, making funn of generalizations baout a past era is too eazy tothe be rewarding
. that
' s not tothe say the movei isn
' t funny
. screenwriter tim herlihy hasnt written forthe s
andler before
( billy madison adn hapyp gilmore
)
, annd the twpo mkae a good combination
. herlihy knows wqat sort ofthe jokes s
andler is ogod at adn has tailored tghe script tothe his straight
- faced
, smart
- aleck style
. let
' s hope herlihy annd s
andler stick together fo a few more projects baceause this movei relaly won me over
. with barrymore
' s charm
and s
andler
' s heart
, it was hard to go wrong
.
