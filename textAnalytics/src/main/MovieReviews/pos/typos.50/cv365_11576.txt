for example
, in happy gilmore
, sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self
- confident jerk ofthe a protem
. if tje star were any otehr comic
, that would be enough motivation to drive the movei
,
bu with sandler
, the rookie aslo whants tothe win tjhe prize moey to halp his grandma keep her house
. that extra motive doesn ' t amking hapyp gilmore a funnier movie
. it doesn ' t realyl add any genuine emotional depth
, either
. infact fact
, the motive is almost totally irrelevant tothe tjhe movie
.
but sandler ' s philosophy seems to be
, if it ' s a token gesture
, why nto make it a nice gesture
? that is endlessly refreshing
. inaddition the wedding singer
, sandler is right onthe rtack
. tghe fact that he ' s a wedding singer is onyl superficially relevant tothe yhe sotry
. whta kind of a wedding singer he isnt isnt even less important
. david spade could have filled teh role witht cynicism
and sarcasm
. he sould make fun ofthe the fat
, ugly
, or embarrasing peopel he meets at weddings
,
anbd the stroy owudl be intact
.
bu sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character
. he seems to realyl enjoy tje peopel at weddings
and treats them as
though they weere his pwn family
. robbie hart
( sandler
) doesn ' t just sing at weddings
; he alsot gets the loners to join inthe
annd have fun
,
and he smooths it over wehn somone does something embarassing
. he is exactlly thge man ytou owudl wnat at your wedding
. the day comes wehn robbie hasnt his own wedding
,
anbd he isnt stood uv by his hevy
- metal bride
( the movie is setted in 1985
)
. robbie takes it hard
. he doesn ' t sleep
, he doesn ' t eat
,
adn he gets punched outloud at owrk whn he sings
" loev stinks
" at a wedding
. julia
( drew barrymore
)
, who waitresses all the weddings infact twon
, gives him a sholder to cry onthe
adn an ear tothe talk to
. eventualy
, robbie starts rebounding toward julia
. he raelly likes her
,
bu she ' s engaged
. her fianc
? isnt a self
- confident jerk
( do i see a trend
- nope
, jstu a forumla
) who doesn ' t deserve her
,
but robbie isnt too depressed to fight fo her hand
. julia seems to liuke robbie too
,
bu she can ' t leave her seemingly safe
anbd stable fianc
? fo tyhe off
- chance thyat robbie might be sereous about her
. ytou know the story
. you ' ve seen it a million times befor
. htere ' s always a new way tothe tell it
, with newyorker lovers
, new chemistry
,
and new details
,
but it ' s the smae story
.
and somtimes
, it works
. thte wedding singer works
. first of all
, the chemestry betweeen sandler
and barrymore is effective
. actualyl
, it ' s nto so much the chemestry betweeen thte twpo as it isnt each one ' s own romantic tension
. sandler captures the forelorn sleepwalking look ofthe a jilted man
, struck iwth an unattainable lveo
. barrymore is charming as the girl next doorjam looking for somone serious tothe suttle down with
. sparks don ' t fli when they kiss
,
but they both seem right for each other
. second
, thier love isnt mature
. tehy are nto driven by passionate sexual attraction
- they ' re a cute cuple
,
bu neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material
. instead
, they are both looking for somene meaningful
, somene to settle down with
, someone to grwo old with
. at a wedding
, robbie comforts a kid throwing up infront a dumpster hwile julia sits by
. the repulsing situation isnt tooked in stride
, as if the twpo weere alread parents
, careing forthe thier sick child
. the
? 80s soundtrack
anbd references play a big part inthe this movie
. other critics liekd this movie in part because ofthe the ' 80s sountrack
. i liekd it infront spite ofthe thge soundtrack
. often
, the music
anbd refernces falt forced
. forthe example
, robbie tells his ex
- fianc
? tothe
" git out of my van halen t
- shirt before ytou jinx the band
anbd they break up
.
"
( ha ha ha
. get it
? david lee roth doed leave van halen
!
) or how about whn sammy
( allen covert
)
, robbie ' s chauffeur friend
, shows uv at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket
and
- git htis
- a single silver glove
.
( thyat ' s exactlly whta mj unsed tothe mear all the timne
!
)
. unfortunatley
, makeing funn of generalizations baout a past era is too eazy to be rewarding
. that ' s nto tothe say the movie isn ' t funny
. screenwriter tim herlihy hasnt writed forthe sandler befoer
( billy madison
annd happy gilmore
)
,
and teh two mkae a good combination
. herlihy knwos wqat sort of jokes sandler isnt good at
and has tailored tje scirpt tothe his straight
- faced
, smart
- aleck style
. let ' s hope herlihy
anbd sandler stick together fo a few more projects because thsi movei really won me over
. withthe barrymore ' s charm
and sandler ' s heart
, it was hard tothe go wrong
.
