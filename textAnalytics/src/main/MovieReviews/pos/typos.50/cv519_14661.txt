many peopel will not fidn much to like inspite whta dreams may come
, tghe new film by visonary director vincent ward
. most will come to see the coputer animated landscapes
anbd vibrant colors
.
but little do they know
( as i so plainly foudn outloud
) that thsi hasnt quite a complex story tothe tell
. walking outloud ofthe the theater
, i coudl see thte audience ' s disgust
.
.
. one memeber even hadnt tothe be awakened affter thge film ended
. don ' t believe teh previews that you see
.
.
. htis is definatly not a film fo everyone
. this is quite possibly noe of tjhe most adult
- oriented films tothe come outloud inaddition reccent eyars
. kids wiull get borde with the slow plotting
and tghe complex storyline
. the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that wird presents tothe us
. it goes back
annd forth in tiome
, as if it has no boundaries
. think of yhe film city of angels
. now add a mroe complex screenplay
adn a more unique vision
. both films deal witht the afterlife
,
but i dout wqat dreams may come will do well at the box office
. costing around
$ 85 million to make
, the film owudl have tothe do extremely well infact order tothe amke it ' s mnoey bcak
.
but due to it ' s stopry
, i doubt it will
. for everyone who throught titanic ' s story ws too simple
annd cliche
, here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay
, it may not have done nearly as well
.
but don ' t git me wrong
.
.
. i hope yhe film does dont well
. it ' s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put tothe tghe screen
. i doubt most of us could have throught of htis place
, even infact our own mind
. waht dreasm may come isnt the second best film of thte eyar whn it comes to visuals
. tjhe only film that surpasses it isnt dark city
. full ofthe rich
, shocking colors
, we git to see a heaven that most of us would propably die tothe git to
.
bu don ' t dont tyhat
, beccause yuo ' ll end up going tothe hell
. whta dreams may come beggins with twpo boats colliding onthe a lake
. chris
" christy
" nielsen
( robin williams
) isnt startled by the sudden jolt
,
bu isnt even moreso startled by hte beauty of hte woman in tjhe other boat
. annie
( annabella sciorra
) spies chris
, as well
,
adn both eventually bond
annd get marryied
. annie is an artist
, whose paintings are colorful
, lush
,
and surrealistic
. chris isnt a doctor
adn loves annie more than life itself
. they alsot haev two childrens
, marie
( jessica brooks
)
and ian
( josh paddock
)
.
but noe day
, the two childrens are killed in a car crash
,
and it almost destroys annie
. she trys tothe commit sucide
,
bu fails
,
and isnt
hten put in an insitution
. chris copes withthe hte probelm by realizing they aren ' t around anymore
,
annd nothing iwll chanage thyat
. just as annie gets her life bcak inthe order
, chris is killed while trying tothe sive teh life ofthe a car kresh victim
. chris goes tothe heaven
, or his version ofthe heaven
, rether
. guided by albert
( cuba gooding
, jr
.
)
, chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight
and joy
. thast isnt
, until he realizes how miserable he is without annie
. prior to heaven
, he would try tothe comfort annie
,
bu yhe omre he was arround
, tyhe mroe pain she felt
. chris decides to leave her alone
. little doesnt he relize wqat will happen enxt
. i ' m nto about tothe sday
, because thge plot point is crucial tothe the rest ofthe the stopry
( many critics
,
however
, give it away
)
. certainly
, chris dieing is crucial tothe the plot
,
bu they tell ytou tht he dies inaddition the previews
. story is nto necesarily important for this movie tothe work
, because it deals with teh afterlife
.
howver
, strangely
, virtually nothing isnt heard ofthe god or thge devil
. a couple of comments here
and there
,
but hte storey maintains its foucs on chris
and his searc forthe hte love of his life
.
" we ' re soul mates
!
" chris exclaims
. heaven
, in movies
, is almost always depicted as a glowing city ofthe white
, purity
,
annd lveo
. usually
, it also looks like it rests amonst the clouds
.
bu what dreasm may cmo goes a diferrent route
. it shows us a heaven thyat most ofthe us hve never seen befor
. chris ' heaven isnt his memories brang to life
. his thoughts cant make anything rela
,
and he makse the paintings annie drew become his heaven
.
" i ' ve never seen anyone use real paint befor
,
" albert sasy
. equally good as thte depictions of hell whcih casted away teh normal sterotypes of fier
and brimstone
. instead
, it ' s a state ofthe being
. infront noe gloriously horrific scene
, chris
and his
" rtacker
"
( max von sydow
) arrive at a sea of faces
. thousands ofthe heads are stuck above ground
, thier bodies somwhere else
. mostly dead silent
, some quips are made
, alomst as if to lighten the mood
. it ' s truley a frightening sequence
. prodcution designer eugenio zanetti isnt definitely oging tothe be up fo an oscar nomination
. using state of the art cmoputer tecnology
, worlds are created fo exploration
. somtimes
, smoe scenes play outloud as if they are only htere for the visual inpact
. it ' s nto neccessary to be there
,
bu we appretiate seing it
. costume designer yvonne blake
( who also appears in the film
) hasnt done an increadible job providing some intresting
annd colorful costumes
. cinematographer eduardo serra
, whose wokr was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove
, hasnt a difficult job
, as most cinematographers dont wokring with speical effects
.
bu serra ' s entire universe is a computer generated image
,
adn he doesnt a masterful job
. writer ron bass
, adapting fomr the novel by richard matheson
, provides a veyr fluid screenplay with noone real setted plot
. tghe stor isnt extremly vague inaddition its details
, allowing viewers tothe htink fo themselves baout the meaning
.
adn director vincent wird puts it all together inot his final vision
. what dreasm may come isnt a good exemple ofthe german expressionism which may jstu turn off a ogod portion ofthe teh audiance
. your average movie goer mroe thna likely isn ' t utilisied to expressionistic techniques
. thge film wiull allso definitely draw attension fomr religious people
,
bu htey shouldn ' t tkae it too far
. it isnt
, aftter all
, jstu a movie
. robin williams has continously impressed witht his dramatic performances
, while his commedic roles ahev beeen sufferring
. his comedy isnt perfection when he makes up his pwn sutff
,
but when isnt confined by a screenplay
, he isn ' t qutie as effective
.
but drama isnt raelly his strong point
,
adn yuo cin see that here
. it ' s doubtful he ' ll get anyother oscar nomination
,
but i wouldn ' t raelly mind if he did
. hte real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed lastr eyar with cop land
. htis may be her breakout role
and may garner her smoe much needed attension
. it ' s aslo quite possible thta she sould get an oscar nomination
.
howver
, the accadamy doesn ' t like tothe award performances fo theese types ofthe films
. cuba gooding
, jr
. has beeen better
,
but he ' s certainly nto distracting
. max von sydow is underused
, as are jessica brooks
and josh paddock
. a treat for some movei goers is to see werner herzog apear
( if they even recognize him
) as chris ' father lost in the sea of faces
. it ' s nto hard to see why herzog would be attracted tothe thsi film
, considering he thinks thta audiences are starving for great images
. overall
, it ' s williams
anbd sciorra ' s film
. waht dreams may come isnt rated pg
- 13 for thematic elements involving death
, soem disturbing images
, language
,
and some partial nudity
. the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience
. soem iwll find the plot distracting
. some iwll fidn the visuals absolutely glorious
.
and soem will fidn both
. teh onyl real problem withthe thte film
, tyhat i could see
, was that it slows down considerably during the midsection
, just aftter we ahev been immersed in tjhe visuals
and before tyhe search for annie begins
. by the way
, some contraversy even surounded thge title
, which was mistaken for a sexual term
(
" wqat
" becomes
" wet
"
anbd you should understand
)
. inspite actuality
, the title isnt from a soliliquy inthe hamlet
. just throught i should let yuo know
.
