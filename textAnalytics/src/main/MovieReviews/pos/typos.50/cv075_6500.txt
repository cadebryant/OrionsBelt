well
, i know tht stallone isnt 50 eyasr old nowe
,
but in daylight he doesn
' t look it
! daylight is a great disaster movei
. if ytou
' ve seen cliffhanger
, you
' ll nkow stallone
' s character aleady
. a guy with a bad past
,
but is in thge right place at the wrong time
. a tunnel connecting newyorker york anbd newyorker jersey hasnt both sides collapses wehn a gropu of robbers collide wih a truck carrying
* vyre
* flammable toxic waste
. a dozen or so people survive hte collapses anbd tje incinerating fireball
(
and what a fire ball it was
!
) stallone
, a fromer emergency medical service man
, isnt chauffeuring a rich couple arround
, whn htey triarch the outside of the tunnel
, befoer teh explosion
. thn
, 30 mintues into the movei
, boom
!
> from here onthe
, the plot tkaes a back seat
, annd we are treated to soem of the best camera wokr adn acation staged
. most all the action is plausible adn wiull hold ytou at the edge ofthe your seat
. ther are a faw melodramatic parts here
, bu
, they tend tothe owrk outloud well
. there isnt no general antagonist inthe htis film
,
but tjhe acation
and suspense makes you forget all baout tht
. daylight is a graet film
, i saw a non
- matinee showing ofthe it
,
and i
thought it wass worth every penny
. the characterizations are mostly flat
, oen dimesional
, bu they have enough infront them to git ytou tothe care for some of the charactors
. rob cohen
( dragonheart
) doesnt a great job withthe this film
.
