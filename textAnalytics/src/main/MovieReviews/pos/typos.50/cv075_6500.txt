well
, i know that stallone is 50 eyasr old nowe
,
but in daylight he doesn ' t look it
! daylight is a gerat disaster movie
. if you ' ve seen cliffhanger
, you ' ll nkwo stallone ' s character laready
. a guy with a bad past
,
bu is infront thge right palce at thge wrong time
. a tunnel connecting new york
and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying
* vyer
* flammable toxic waste
. a dozen or so people survive the collapses
and tghe incinerating fireball
(
adn waht a fire ball it was
!
) stallone
, a former emergency medical service man
, is chauffeuring a rich cuple around
, whn they triarch the outside of tyhe tunnel
, befor the explosion
.
hten
, 30 minutes inot the movie
, boom
!
> ffrom here onthe
, yhe plot tkaes a back seat
,
adn we are treated tothe soem ofthe yhe best camera wrok
and action staged
. most all the action isnt plausible
and iwll hold you at thte edge of your seat
. there are a few melodramatic parts here
,
bu
, tehy tend tothe work out well
. htere is no general antagonist inwhich this film
,
but hte action
annd suspense makes ytou foreget all baout that
. daylight is a great film
, i saw a non
- matinee showing ofthe it
,
anbd i thought it was worth every penny
. thte characterizations are mostly flat
, one dimesional
,
but they ahev enough in them tothe get you tothe care for soem ofthe thge cahracters
. rob cohen
( dragonheart
) does a graet job with this film
