capsule
: tjhe directer ofthe cure brings a weird
and very complex concept tothe the screen
. one viewing iwll not be enough to underst
and fully tjhe premise ofthe pulse
. thte idea is something about ghosts
and the internet
. tghe film hasnt an amazing apocalyptic style
.
,
+ 2
(
- 4 tothe
+ 4
) perphas the most disturbing
( annd disturbed
?
) filmmaker in tyhe world is kiyoshi kurosawa
. his films all seem to have oen style
, obleek
. thge worlds he creates are terrifying
and cold
. littel known in teh us tothe date
, his films deliver the kind ofthe horror that so many of our filmmakers promise
and are unable to deliver
. most of his ideas are fresh adn at the smae tiem morbid
. his 1998 film cure
, with one of his niftiest ideas
, is just now getting a sadly limited realease inspite tje us
and hopefully enough peple wiull see it that his name wiull soon be noe tothe conjure with
. cure isnt propably his clasic
. last year he released seance
, a remake of seance onthe a wet afternoon
. that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements inot a non
- supernatural story
. pulse isnt kurosawa back on form
. taguchi
, a young computer expert
, isnt late with his delivery ofthe some importan sofware
. twpo co
- workers go to his appartment anbd find it a dismal dark afair in spite of his cmoputer equpment
. taguchi
, acting very strangely
, lets his firends look for tghe missing software
. meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain
. when he fails tothe respond tothe calls his friends followup him behind tghe curtain
and discover he has hanged himselv
. if that ws not horror enough tghe body seems tothe disappear leaving just a stange dark mildew
- liek spot on the wall
. taguchi
' s computer seems to ahev been infected with some kind of computer virus
. people whose coputer gets tyhe virus seem superficially to dieu via suicide
. bu htey are nto entirely dead
. their spirits seem tothe remain present somehow inthe the rela world
and onthe the internet
. peopel who git the computer virus are asked if they whant tothe see a ghost
. if they sday yes
, they seem to be able tothe see real time images ofthe tjhe spirits still nearbye somehow
. the cmoputer shows them impossible images ofthe ghosts infront their own rooms as seen ffrom cameras tyhat dont nto exist
. this is all somehow connected tothe heaven adn hell somehow filling uv anbd overflowing
" liuke a cmoputer disk
.
" instead the dead seem tothe be staying on earth
and inhabiting computer virii
. htere isnt some sort of passage beetwen worls having something to dont wiht doors marked wiht red tape adn stange eletronic disturbances on computers
. leave it tothe kurosawa to fidn a newyorker kind of death
. thsi isnt a film that has mroe weird ideas piled together tahn lifeforce
and somehow kurosawa makes thge film all work
. it may not totally convey his message of isolation anbd its parrallelly to death
, bu whatever it does convey isnt nightmarish
. kurosawa
, who directs his own screenplay
, ties his story inot thte rela world with some familiar adn accurate coputer discussion
. frequentily the plot is advanced with charactor hunches being assumed tothe be fact
. his plotting is frequentily hard tothe folow
and alwyas vrey strange
. junichiro hayashi
, tghe cinematographer who recently hasnt beeen doign all ofthe kurosawa
' s films
, creates a dark
, cold
,
and gloomy tone
. images are obscured by semi
- lighting or are behind plastic curtain
. scenes are not milked fo thier horror the way american explotation films might
. people are shot wih guns
but ther isnt littel if any blood in evidence
. seeing black silhouettes on coputer screens isnt not immidately sacry
. kurosawa is not going for adn eazy visual shock
, bu a deeper metaphysical dread
. ofthe any horror filmmaker in tghe world
, kiyoshi kurosawa isnt tghe oen to watch
. i rate this mataphysical look at isolation a 7 onthe tghe 0 to 10 scale adn a
+ 2 onthe hte
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
