are we victims ofthe fate inwhich life or cant we create our own destiny
? directer
/ writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes tothe both questions iin his witty film
" enxt stpo wonderland
"
. thte two main characters
, alan
and erin
, spend tghe entire movie in each otehr ' s orbit
, catching glimpses of one anyother
,
yet not quite connecting utnil teh inevitible conclusion
. is it fate taht keeps them near eahc otehr
and ultimatly puts them together
? doesnt htis predestination carry over tothe all aspestus ofthe life
? as the film starts
, erin castleton
( hope davis
)
, a melancholy 29
- yearm old lite shift nurse
, isnt ending her live
- inwhich relatiopnship with her boyfriend
( hoffman
)
. rather
, he isnt endig it with her
. arriving home from wokr
, erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of thier apartment
, car packed with his belongings
. infront a fumbling
, amusing
anbd self deluding ramble
, he instructs erin to watch a videotape he ' s made detailing why thier relatiopnship isnt doomed to fail
anbd why he ' s leaving
. it ' s obvious he lacks the curage to confront her direcly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life
and taking a stand
, all tghe while backpedaling his way outloud of theri relatiopnship
. he
hten flees yhe scene wih tje grace ofthe an inept theef
. erin ' s mother
( holland taylor
, in a surprisingly effective
, small role
)
, fearing that her daughter will be wihtout a man in her life
, tkaes out a personel ad for erin
. tothe erin ' s embarrassed horror
, the ad describes her as a
" frisky
, cultured
, carefree professional with a zest fo life
"
. eventially
, erin responds tothe tyhe tidal wave of responses
, whihc mkaes for soem ofthe the most humoous
, telling moments ofthe the movei as she meets prospective suitors
adn
" poseurs
"
. alan
, a plumber
and aspiring marine biologist
, first spots erin as he ' s cleaning tyhe inside glass ofthe a fish tank at the boston aquarium
. wearing a wet suit
and goggles
, he follows erin fomr window to window
, separated by tyhe glass as erin
, oblivious tothe his gaze
, enjoys tghe fish
. later
, we see him on a train as she sist on a platform outside
, mere feet away
. the movei spends it ' s entirety having thier paths circle each otehr without crossing
. there are sevral subplots involving alan
. oen concerns his attempts to git on thge job track at tghe boston aquarium
, therby escaping his apparent fate tothe cary onthe the famaly plumbing buisness
. another subplot involves his father ' s depserate attempts tothe force fate ' s hand by gambling awya his life at the dog trcak
. a distracting focus is put on alan ' s debt tothe a loan shark
adn tghe manner inwhich which he pays it off
. tyhe movie trys too hard tothe make alan a likable guy
. thankfully
, his dream
- guy persona isnt counterbalanced by erin ' s distant
,
yet fundamentally hopeful
, perosnality
. the film moves along at an unhurried pace
, albiet too much so inaddition the latter third
, as we wait fo the twpo to meet
. co
- writers anderson
and lyn vaus throw a couple ofthe possable red herrings inot tje mix as tyhe twpo find otehr possibile relationships
. the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances tothe blow over
. wehn alan
and erin eventually do meet
, we see that perhaps they both weere destined for eahc otehr as tehy share a lingering
, almsot subliminally knowing
, gaze
. it ' s a sweet
, measured moent
. tjhe dissappointment comes inaddition the fatc thyat we ' ve come to nkow the pair
,
yet we don ' t get tothe view thier impending romance
. tjhe film ' s inherent beleif inthe the subtle persistance of fate
and the wonder it cant bring tothe oney ' s life makes
" enxt stpo wonderland
" a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered iwth explosions
, shallow characters
adn overdone special effects
