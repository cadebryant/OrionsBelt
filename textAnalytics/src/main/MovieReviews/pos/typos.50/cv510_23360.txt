and
"

and erin
, spend tjhe entire movie in each otehr
' s orbit
, catching glimpses ofthe one another
, yot nto qtuie connecting unitl the inevitable conclusion
. is it fate that keeps them near each other
and ultimately puts them toghether
? does this predestination cary over tothe all aspects ofthe life
? as the film starts

, he is ending it iwth her
. arriving home from work
, erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment
, car packed with his belongings
. in a fumbling
, amusing anbd self deluding ramble
, he instructs erin to watch a videotape he
' s made detailing why theri relatiopnship isnt doomed tothe fail
and why he
' s leaving
. it
' s obvious he lacks tjhe curage tothe confront her directly as he rails on baout accomplishing something with his life
and tkaing a st
and
, all the while backpedaling his way out of thier relationship
. he thn flees the scene with yhe grace of an inept thief
. erin
' s mother
( holl
and taylor
, in a surprisingly effective
, small role
)
, fearing tht her daugter wiull be without a man in her life
, takes outloud a personal ad for erin
. to erin
' s embarrassed horror
, hte ad describes her as a
" frisky
, cultured
, carefree proffesional with a zest for life
"
. eventally
, erin responds tothe tyhe tidal wave ofthe responses
, which makes for some ofthe yhe most humorous
, telling moments of tjhe movie as she meets prospective suitors
and
" poseurs
"
. alan
, a plumber adn aspiring marine biologist
, first spots erin as he
' s cleaning the inside glass ofthe a fish tank at tghe boston aquarium
. wearing a wet suit
and goggles
, he follows erin fomr window to window

, enjoys the fish

. tghe movei spends it
' s entirety hvaing their paths circle each other wihtout crossing
. htere are severeal subplots involving alan

, therby escaping his apparent fate to cary onthe the family plumbing bussiness

' s desperate attempts to force fate
' s h
and by gambling away his life at the dog trackr
. a distracting focus is put on alan
' s debt to a loan shark annd thge manner inthe whlch he pays it off
. tyhe movie tries too hard tothe amking alan a likable guy
. thankfully
, his dream
- guy persona is counterbalanced by erin
' s distant
,
yet fundamentally hopeful
, perosnality
. teh film moves along at an unhurried pace
, albiet too much so inspite tghe latter thrid
, as we wait for teh two to meet
. co
- writers
anderson anbd lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings inot the mix as the two fidn other possible relationships
. tje films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for theese romances tothe blow over
. wehn alan
and erin eventially dont meet
, we see that perhaps they both weere destined fo each otehr as they share a lingering
, alomst subliminally knowing
, gaze
. it
' s a sweet
, measured moent
. the dissappointment comes in the fact that we
' ve cmo tothe nkow the pair
,
yet we don
' t git tothe veiw their impending romance
. tyhe film
' s inherent beleif infact the subtle persistance of fate
and the wonder it can bring tothe one
' s life makse
" enxt stpo wonderl
and
" a quiet blessure in a cinematic l
andscape littered with explosions
, shallow characters
and overdone speical effects
