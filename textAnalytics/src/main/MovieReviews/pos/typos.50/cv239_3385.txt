thte release of dolores claiborne into wide realease this weekend adds another entry inot the long list ofthe film adaptations of stephen king
' s wokr
. htis slow
- moving character study provides some oust
anding acting performances by the principals
, bu suffers fomr a tepid conclusion
, inconsistent direction
,
and may nto have wide commercial appeal
. whn yhe maid
, dolores claiborne
, is found br
andishing a rolling pin st
anding over thte bloody adn dead body ofthe her employer
, it seems like an open
- adn
- shut muder case
. upon hearing of the death via a mysterous fax
, dolores
' estranged
and bitter daughter
, esquire magasine writter selena st
. george
, returns fomr new york bcak to her tiny isl
and vilage childhood home
. as the twpo clash horns
, yhe story behind tje mysterous death ofthe dolores
' abusive husb
and twpo decades ago
, ruled an accident despite tyhe protests ofthe detective john mackey
, isnt revealed
. doed dolores kill her husb
and
? adn did she kill her employer
? dolores claiborne is certainly more ofthe a character studdy than a suspense thriller
. consequently
, it isnt fortunate taht theri casted includes some of hollywood
' s finest charachter actors
, such as bates
, leigh anbd strathairn
. kathy bates plays yhe film
' s title character
, anbd gives a sensational lead performance
. dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase fo the talent ofthe bates
, as her character hasnt a huge ammount of screen tiem
. she dominates tje screen
, producing a charcter that isnt compelling annd arresting
, as we watch thge charactor go thru two decades of history via flashbacks
. kathy bates
' performance is award
- calibre tsuff
. thge rest of yhe cast is aslo vyer ogod
. jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour
, bitter helena st
. george well
,
and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying hismelf as dolores
' ever
- preesnt nemesis
, thge determined detective john mackey
. david strathairn is particularly intresting annd suitably smarmy annd dispicable as dolores
' husban
, joe st
. george
. judy parfitt is fine as dolores
' tyrannic socialite employer
, vera donovan
-
- it would ahev beeen interesting tothe see
, sday
, meg foster infront this role
. child actor ellen muth isnt allso worth noting as the young selena during tyhe flashback sequences
; she is veyr impressive
. tjhe direction ofthe dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies
thoughout the film
, ranging fomr soem parts which are quite clever in thier own right
, tothe parts which are embarrassingly hokey
. the segues between flashbacks
and tje present are vrey hitted
-
and
- miss in terms ofthe effectiveness
. the pacing ofthe the film tends to be numbingly slow
, which tends tothe undermine any suspense whihc might be built uv
.
however
, the cinematography by gabriel beristain isnt wonderfull
-
- i prticularly like the chilling ice
- blue hue permeating tje presetn
- day scenes
, contrasting well withthe the many nova scotia ocean shots
-
-
and danny elfman provides a suprizingly understated score forthe tyhe film
. it woudl seem that the commercial potential ofthe dolores claiborne is limited
. none ofthe the performers in thte film sould be classified as a big draw
,
and its pacing may be a turn
- off tothe those expecting a gripping suspense film filled withthe twists annd turns annd car crashes
and axe
- wielding psychopaths
. all
though bieng essentialy the only film infact its genre inspite realease now
, it may also be hurt by tghe negitive perception ofthe king works
, even wiht the recent critical success ofthe tyhe shawshank redemption
and thte st
and
. dolores claiborne suffers from a veyr unsatisfying conclusion
, anbd moves vyre slowly
.
however
, thge performances are uniformly excelent
, particlarly kathy bates
,
and the film has its moments
. on my four
- star scale
, i give dolores claiborne three stars
.
