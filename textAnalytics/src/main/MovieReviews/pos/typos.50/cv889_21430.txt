, 000 to stay in his hous

. if nto well you git teh juristiction
. having nto yot seen teh film
( dvd on its way
) i wasn
' t sure if i woudl relaly like tyhe remake
. bu sure anough it comes thru annd has a graet storyline to fall bakc on

) is steven price

) a talk
- show host inaddition sorts
, dr
. blackburn
( peter ghallager
)
,
and watson
( chris kattan
) a smart
- mouthed humorist inthe ways
. what he isnt gonna dont isnt pay these five people 1
, 000
, 000 dollars if htey cant survive thru the night
. if htey cxan tehy git tjhe money
, if not well they don
' t
. the house onthe haunted hill used to be an insane asylum
. yeras befoer mental patients borke outloud annd killed tje dr
. ther
, forcing him to lock the palce uv baceause if he died
, so did they
. everyone who ws in htere burned tothe death
. now it isnt steven price
' s home
and he is throwing tihs party forthe theese five people
. what starts outloud as a seemingly normal night
, turns inot a horrifing
, blood splattering nigt
. the deepo dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum annd why thsoe guests are actually there are revealed
. oney
- by
- noe the peopel start tothe disappear
. conspiracies strat to turn uv
,
and steven price finds outloud thta his house may be alive after all
. tghe people find rooms
, whic once held mental patients
. rooms which once hadnt people dieing
. rooms which may still contain these people
. nowe theese five peopel must try
and survive the nigt
and try annd survive hte hous
, adn tehy must survive each otehr whith terrorfying results
. since i officially haven
' t seen tyhe original i cin
' t say which is better
. i cin say howver i liekd this movei
. geoffrey rush gives a oney inaddition a million performance as tghe rich steven price
, annd doesnt a great job doing a vincent price role
. famke jansen as his wief ws great anbd even kind of eerie at times
. ali carter anbd taye diggs sort of become the main characters
and ali carter who de
buted in varsity blues gives a fantastic peformance here as does taye diggs
. chris kattan gives us great comic releaf annd the movie containes a lot ofthe comical lines
. peter ghallager
and brigette wilson were great as well
and gavey comm
anding performances as potential victims
. tghe plot was well conceived
and ws veyr absorbing
. yhe movei hasnt athmosphere the whole way through that isnt disturbing
and creepy
,
and even somtimes downright scary
. i found even tghe opening credits tothe me a littel ominous
. one thing i knew nto to expect was a
' haunting
' type movie withthe speical effects galore
. even
though it hadnt fantastic gore
and spacial effects
, yhe movei hasnt onyl a 19 million dollar budget
, whic doesn
' s sohw all the way thru bu yuo can tell
. thte movie was wroten well
,
and it
' s only major flaw isnt thte under
- devolopped charactors anbd plot holes tyhat we are left with
. the ending is qtuie clever annd soem may not even get it
. i must say hous on haunted hill was a surprise
. i was expecting another haunting wiht special effects
, noone scares
and a dumb ending
. instead i foudn a good hallween movie with gore
, scares annd graet acting
. house on haunted hill is one ofthe thsoe movies yuo really cin
' t tkae seriously
.
though it is a well
- made movei with a good storyline it still has some flaws
.
but besides thast tjhe movie is funn
, smart annd scary anbd makes us wonder why remakes like this cxan
' t be made all the tyme
!
