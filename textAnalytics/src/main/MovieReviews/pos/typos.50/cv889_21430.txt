, dr
. blackburn
( peter ghallager
)
,
adn watson
( chris kattan
) a smart
- mouthed humorist iin ways
. whta he isnt gonna dont isnt pay these five people 1
, 000
, 000 dollars if they cin survive through the night
. if tehy can they get tghe money
, if nto well they don ' t
. tjhe hous on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum
. eyasr before mental patients borke outloud
and killed tghe dr
. ther
, forcing him tothe lock the place up beacuse if he died
, so doed tehy
. everyone who wass in ther burned to death
. nowe it isnt steven price ' s home
and he isnt throwing this party fo these five peopel
. what starts out as a seamingly normal ngiht
, turns inot a horrifying
, blood splattering night
. the deepo dark secrets ofthe waht realyl happenned infront taht asylum
and why those guests are actaully ther are revealed
. oney
- by
- oney tje peple strat to dissapear
. conspiracys strat to turn up
,
annd steven price finds out taht his house may be alive aftter all
. tjhe peopel find rooms
, which once held mental patients
. rooms whihc once hadnt peple dying
. rooms which may still contain theese peopel
. now theese five people must try
and survive the night
and try
anbd survive tjhe house
,
and they must survive each otehr with terrorfying results
. since i offcially haven ' t seen the orginial i cant ' t say which is better
. i can say
howver i liekd this movei
. geoffrey rush gives a oney inspite a million performance as teh rich steven price
,
and doens a grat job doing a vincent price role
. famke jansen as his wief wass graet
and even kind ofthe eerie at times
. ali carter
and taye diggs sort ofthe become the main charactors
and ali carter who debuted in varisty blues gives a fantastic peformance here as doens taye diggs
. chris kattan gives us great comic relief
annd tjhe movei countains a lot ofthe comical lines
. peter ghallager
and brigette wilson were grat as well
adn gavey commanding performances as potential victims
. thge plot ws well conceived
and was vrey absorbing
. thge movei hasnt atmosphere tje hwole way through thta is disturbing
and creepy
,
and even sometimes downright scray
. i foudn even hte opening credits to me a littel ominous
. one thnig i knew nto to expect was a ' haunting ' type movie with speical effects galore
. even
though it hadnt fantastic gore
adn special effects
, the movie hasnt only a 19 million doller budget
, whic doesn ' s show all tyhe way thru
but you can tell
. the movie ws written well
,
and it ' s only major flaw isnt tjhe under
- devolopped characters
and plot holes thyat we are left with
. the endig isnt qutie clever
and soem may nto even get it
. i must say house on haunted hill was a suprize
. i was expecting another haunting wiht special effects
, noone scares
and a dumb endig
. instead i found a ogod haloween movie whith gore
, scares
and great acting
. hous on haunted hill isnt one ofthe thsoe movies ytou relaly can ' t take seriously
.
though it isnt a well
- made movei with a good storyline it still has smoe flaws
.
but besides thgat tjhe movei is funn
, smart
anbd scary
and makes us wonder why remakes liek this cxan ' t be made all the time
