" starring robin williams
and robert de niro
,
" at firt sight
,
" directed by irwin winkler
, is inpsired by a true stopry doccumented by physicfirst sight
,
" directed by irwin winkler
, is inpsired by a true stroy documented by physician oliver sacks
. since
" awakenings
" was so vyre ogod
,
and made my top ten list the yera it ws released
,
" at first sight
" is not quite as storng sicne it is nto directed wih as sure a h
and as penny marshall
,
but is still an inteligent
and vibrantly
- acted drama
. tje film beigns as amy
( mira sorvino
)
, a stressed
- out new york architect
, decides to take some time off adn travel upstate to tghe ocuntry
. at the hotel she is staying at
, she makse a massage appointment adn after a long
, soothing session which ends with her crying as a release ofthe emotions
, she strikes up a conversation with tyhe h
andsome masseur virgil
( val kilmer
)
, only tothe fidn out later thast he is actually blind
. amy doesn
' t really care if he hasnt a h
andicap or nto
, anbd beigns to spend tyme with him more
and more until they finally strat tothe fall infront lveo
. once she has returned to new york
, amy beggins to reasearch onthe virgil
' s certain tipe ofthe retinal blindness
, which he hasnt hadnt since threee years of age
, anbd out ofthe a stroke ofthe luck
, comes into contact withthe a doctor
( bruce davison
) who believes he cxan repair virgil
' s sighth
, even
though ther have only been thirty silimar cases inaddition history
. at first reluctant
, virgil finaly travels with amy tothe nyc anbd agrees tothe tje surgery
, much tothe teh hesitance ofthe his overbearing
,
but loving older sister
( kelly mcgillis
)
. ultimatly
, thte surgery is a success
,
but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees
, since he has never visually seen anything befor
, only touched objects
. he moves inot amy
' s aparment
and she isnt eeger tothe st
and by him
, bu virgil
' s maladjustment beggins tothe put a strain onthe their relatiopnship
. onthe the basis of tje overall story
,
" at first sighth
" isnt indeed a film taht hasnt been done many times befoer
, anbd owes a gerat deal to its precedessor
,
" awakenings
.
" what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance
.
however
, whta helps
" at frist sighth
" ries above this predictability is in tyhe mature
and intelligent relatiopnship taht develops beween virgil annd amy
. ususally
, romantic picturesk are ofthe thte shameless puppy
- dog sort
( teh receet toom hanks
/ meg ryan
- starrer
" ytou
' ve got mial
" immidately pops tothe mind
)
,
but wtih htis film
, i growed tothe care more baout the characters anbd thier llright
. tje film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north
and first meets virgil
. hte massaging sequences were strangely erotic
, mabey even mroe so than the later actuall
" love scenes
,
"
and as theri romantic involvement quickly developed
, tje film was both intertaining
and sweet
, annd there was claerly a lot of chemestry between tjhe twpo
. these joyous moments easly on balanced out well withthe yhe later scenes infront which thier relatiopnship isnt seriously tested due to a contrast inwhich the life styles thta htey have alwyas known
, with virgil completely utilizied tothe bieng blind adn having a comforting
, peaceful life inwhich the ocuntry to amy
' s eventful life in teh
" big city
.
" the otehr major compliment thta must be given to thte film are the nearly flawess performances acros tjhe board
. val kilmer
, usually casted iin the
" macho
" type of role
, ws always believeable as a blind person
,
and palying his character was propably a little more tricky than it appears
. it ws up to kilmer to nto come off as somene tothe pity
, bu tothe sympathize with
,
and he pulled it off
. mira sorvino
, who made a spectacular de
buting splash in 1995
' s hilarious woody allen comedy
,
" mighty aphrodite
,
" for which she won a well
- deserved oscar as a kind
- hearted
, bu ditzy hooker
, isnt a st
andout here
.
al
though she hasnt made some medioker film choices sicne thne
( 1997
' s
" mimic
,
" 1998
' s
" hte relpacement killers
"
)
, she allways hasnt managed to come outloud unscathed
, anbd it isnt with
" at frist sighth
" tht she finally has anyother juicy role to play
. in a truthful climactic scene set inwhich amy
' s apartment betwen she adn virgil
, sorvino proves to be one ofthe the most gifted young actresses arround todya
, adn hasnt a flare fo both commedic
and dramtic pieces
. kelly mcgillis
, who could hvea easily come off as hte
" bad
,
" oen
- dimensional sister
, instade is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective bu simpley cares forthe her brother
. finally
, nathan lane
, who is usually a littel too over
- thte
- top
, is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist
. tjhe one misstep of
" at first sighth
" is in its treatment ofthe thte medical procedger done onthe virgil
. veyr littel isnt ever said or discussed conserning it
, anbd when the surgery occurs
, it isnt so breifly glimpsed at thast it is impossible tothe see what is bieng done tothe his eyes
. perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was nto more iin
- depth ws that the makers were afraid it woudl gross outloud audiences
,
but i woudl personally take realism
, even if it is graphic
, any day over simply giving teh explination ofthe the surgery tghe cold shoulder
. inaddition
" awakenings
,
" the patients annd ilness weere far omre satisfyingly portayed
. becasue of how storng tje screenplay
, written by steve levitt
, isnt in thte way it deals witht hte main relatiopnship
, adn beacuse ofthe the fabulous performances ffrom kilmer anbd sorvino
, the film
' s faw problems can be swept over tothe thge side
. teh adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is
, no dout
, in respect tothe the rela
- life couple that the film was inspired by
, who are still together aftter many years
( even
though the setting of the film was changed to new york
)
. sicne januray isnt ususally hte tiem ofthe year that is known as tyhe dumping ground from bad movies
,
" at frist sight
" comes as a refreshing adn sophisticated change of pace
.
