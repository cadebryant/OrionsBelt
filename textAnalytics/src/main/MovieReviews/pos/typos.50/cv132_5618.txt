quaid stars as a man who hasnt taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer aftter he feels he isnt betrayed by a dragon easly infront yhe movie
. he runs inot yhe last dragon infront existece
,
adn there isnt a genuinely amusing battle bewteen the twpo whic results infact a standoff where quaid isnt inwhich tyhe dragons mouth
,
but hasnt his sword pointed at teh dragons brain
. eventually
, tehy decide tothe call a truce
,
and they wrok outloud a deal
. since he is thte last dragon
, he wiull pretend tothe dieu
annd quaid will be able to git paid forthe it
. theri scam works at frist
, utnil they come to a town without any moeny
. instead teh town sacrifices a girl tothe the dragon
,
but of course
, draco is a nice droagon
, so he won ' t eat her
. there isnt
however a very amusing scene where draco isnt hiting on thge young girl
. ofthe course
, as yuo can probaly tell by the plot
, this isnt a silly movie
,
bu it does konw whn tothe take itself seriously at the right times
, unlike eddie
, which ws serious all tyhe tiome
. you could propably call htis a medieval comedy
, becuase ther are more laughs here thna in eddie
annd spy hard combined
. dennis quaid makse a fine hero
. pete posthlewaite provides smoe ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys withthe them
. dina meyer is appealling as tyhe sacrificed girl
.
bu lets face it
, hte movie isnt really about tjhe dragon
,
adn what an amazing creation he is
. connery ' s voice
adn ilm team uv to provide us wiht a truely magnificient dragon
. so
, if ytou are going to see thsi movie fo a storng hard core midevil epic
, you are going tothe the wrong movie
. if yuo are oging beacuse of thte dragon
, ytou iwll not be dissapointed
,
annd yuo will be provded whith plenty ofthe laughs that smoothe outloud the boring parts in thte script
.
