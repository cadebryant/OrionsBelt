quaid stars as a man who has taken uv the proffesion of dragonslayer affter he fiels he is betrayed by a dragon eearly in thge movie
. he runs inot the lastest dragon inthe existence
, annd htere is a genuinely amusing battle between yhe twpo whitch results infact a st
andoff where quaid isnt inspite yhe dragons mouth
, bu has his sword pointed at the dragons brain
. evenhtually
, tehy decide to call a truce
, anbd they owrk outloud a deal
. sicne he isnt teh last dragon
, he iwll pretend tothe dieu
and quaid iwll be able tothe get payed for it
. their scam works at frist
, until htey come tothe a twon wihtout any monay
. instade tyhe twon sacrifices a girl tothe hte dragon
, bu of course
, draco is a nice droagon
, so he won
' t eat her
. ther is
however a veyr amusing scene where draco is hiting onthe the young girl
. ofthe course
, as you can probably tell by the plot
, this is a silly movie
,
but it does know when tothe tkae itself seriously at the right times
, unlike eddie
, which was sereous all yhe tiome
. you could probaly call this a medieval comedy
, baceause there are more laughs here than inaddition eddie anbd spy hard combined
. dennis quaid mkaes a fine hero
. pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journies wiht them
. dina meyer isnt appealing as teh sacrificed girl
.
but lets face it
, tjhe movei isnt realy about the dragon
, anbd what an amazing creation he is
. connery
' s voice
and ilm team uv to provide us with a truley magnificent dragon
. so
, if ytou are gonig tothe see thsi movei for a strong hard core mdeieval epic
, you are gogin tothe the wrong movie
. if yuo are going becouse ofthe the dragon
, ytou wiull not be dissapointed
, adn you wiull be provded with plenty of laughs thgat smooth out teh boring parts in the script
.
