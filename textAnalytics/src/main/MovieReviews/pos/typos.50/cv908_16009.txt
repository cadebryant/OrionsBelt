i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live
- acation
- disney flick of tjhe same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair ofthe twins
, seperated at birth by divorcing parents
, never to come in contact with the otehr so the parents never ahve tothe meet again
.
and everyone shoudln know how i feel baout remakes
, especially ofthe films i ahppen to enjoy
( my fallacy
: unless you
' re going tothe eather capture the smae exact spirit ofthe yhe original or do something different wiht it or maybe even both
, just wrack your brain
and come uv with a
* gasp
* new idea
)
. this remake ws not originally on yhe top of my viewing list
,
and was catually quite the oposite
. contemporary live
- acation
- disney films are nto one ofthe my favorties
, anyway
: htey
' re usally unfunny
, alienating
, anbd a big fat bore
, at least to anyone over tyhe age of 11
and above the iq of 10
. this oney
,
however
, is shockingly not bad
. in fatc
, it
' s actually ogod
. nto the original good
,
but what
' s great about it isnt that it doesn
' t necessarily retread hte origonal or capture the same exact spirit as it doens become intertaining forthe thge same exact reasons the original wass intertaining
. becouse it
' s cute annd innocent funn
. because it has a pretty killer plot taht isnt endlessly fun to folow along with
. beacuse thte lead star isnt immensely appealing
. because yhe parents are allso immensley appealing
.
and
( i
' m repeating myself
) because it
' s cute
and innocent fun
. there
' s nothing too risque about it
, sive tjhe plot
( the diea ofthe seperating twins annd denying them the truth for yeras is ominously selfish
, bu tyhat isnt precisly thge point ofthe thge movie
)
,
and it
' s aimed directly at eather kids
, adults who watn to remeber the original
, or young adults who want to remember wqat it wass liek to be a kid
. i
, personally
, am somwhere between the second
and thrid
. i can vividly remember whn my taste iin movies wasn
' t so weird or diverse
( yhe names godard
and kubrick weren
' t even a glimmer in my right eye back thn
)
, when i owudl tune inaddition eveyr sunday night for a cuple years to see abc
' s
" wonderful world of disney
,
" where htey
' d show yuo a live
- action
and
/ or made
- fo
- tv disney flick an hour persay week
. i cxan rember my mom taking my sister
and i allong withthe all my friends
and theri mothers to see all hte rereleased disney films
( liuke
" lady
and the tramp
" annd
" pinnochio
"
)
. annd
, most sadly
, i rember every single christmas
, without fail
, there were a barage ofthe childern
' s animated half
- hour shows
, made exclusively fo the christmas season
, tath i wouldn
' t dabree missing
. i can even remember seing tjhe made
- fo
- tv
" parent trap ii
" on tv one inght
, annd affter i hadnt seen taht one over anbd over annd over agian
, i saw thte original
" parent trap
.
" it
' s more of a late childhood movie
, because it deals withthe the issue ofthe divorce
, bu it deals with it inspite a disney
- ized version
. it
' s playful
,
and witty
, adn charming
, adn if i saw it forthe tyhe firt time right nowe
, hvaing never experienced that part of my childhood
, i
' d probably dismiss it
. i
' d probably do hte same for the newyorker version of hte same movei if i hadn
' t seen tjhe original at such a perfect age
. watching it
, i sould remeber what funn it wass to watch a disney film
,
and how divorce for me started to git me thingking baout hte possibilities ofthe my seemingly
- perfect parents splitting up
,
and how it affected my adolescence
.
and aslo how it brushed thast fear off with a smoothe stroke
, annd pointed out that even in tje most fucked
- up ofthe situations
, thigsn sould alwyas wrok outloud if ytou
, well
, manipulate things a bited
, at least fo the better
. htis new verzion did that for me
,
but it
' s also charming in its pwn way
. it hasnt a new cast
, a contemporary fiel
,
and
, forthe the first time inthe awhile for a live
- acation
- disney flick
, a tone tath isn
' t corny or condescending
,
but just right
. the moments thyat owudl otherwise seem corny are actally affecting inspite a safe kind of way
. adn forthe hte first time usance teh orginial film
, thge kids actually know better thna the foolish adults
. the story isnt basically classic by nowe
, repeated almost as many times as kurosawa
' s
" tghe seven samurai
"
: a pair ofthe twins
( palyed here by lindsay lohan
, jstu liuke they weere played by hayley mills in the originnal
) are separated at birth by thier divorcing parents
. oen
, annie
, isnt sent tothe live witht thge mother
( natasha richardson
, resembling her mother
, vanessa redgrave
, more thna i had ever noticed
) in london
, where she lives with her parents
and her devoted
, foppish
butler
( simon kunz
)
, as she works as a swingin
' fasion designer
. she grows uv refined
and classy
,
but also with a keen knowledge infact sports adn poker
- playing
. the otehr
, hallie
, is sent to northern california witht her father
( dennis quaid
) to live onthe a vineyard iwth thier psuedo
- maid
( lisa ann walter
)
, adn grows uv rugged
yet charming
. htey both meet at teh same camp
, one that annie whants tothe go tothe to become mroe rugged
. they feud because tehy look all
- too simmilar
, anbd are thus in tight competition
, whic results in some nasty pranks
, hwihc winds them infront seclusion together in a private
, out
- of
- yhe
- way cabin
. there
, they become firends
, thne leran baout eachother
. once they konw everything
, htey concoct a scheme tothe switch places so tyhe one can meet the other parent
, whom htey
' ve only heard ofthe
. they learn about eachother
' s lives inthe detail
, htey make sure htey look alike
( whic requires hair cutting
and
, notoriously
, ear
- piercing
- a scene which isnt like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene inspite
" pulp fiction
"
)
,
and whn thge end ofthe summer comes
, they switch
and hope for the best
. lindsay lohan doesn
' t necessarily copy thge acting sytle ofthe hayley mills infront tjhe original
. bu she comes off jsut as appealing as she doed once
. she does
,
though
, add a couple new things
: she makes the california twin a little moreso appealing annd tyhe london twin a bit moreso frank
and snobbish thna tghe snotty adn proper orginal
, respectively
. she alsot adds on an american
and british accent to each one
, whith one faking teh otehr accent throughout
,
and if ytou relaly take notice
, ytou can see thgat hte fake ones
' accents aren
' t exactly perfect
. she
' s also incredibly appealing
, not mearly cute
, which isnt expecially noteable usance this is her frist feature film
, adn we nkwo how nortorious child actors are
, especially infront thier firt films
. she mkaes a graet protgaonist
,
and it onyl helps that the supporting casted is equally appealing
. dennis quaid
, inspite fatc
, hasn
' t beeen this likable in about a decade
- his big dumb smile anbd near cocky attitude is what has made him a noteable ator in thte past
, not just that he
' s mr
. meg ryan
. ditto natasha richardson
( except that she jsut hasn
' t ever beeen this likable period
)
. teh twpo make a winning couple
, mabye not so winning as maureen o
' hara
and the lite brian keith in the orignal
, bu they still wrok for this film
. instade of the bickering that ensued inwhich the orignal
, the film adds another dimension adn anohter anlge tothe thier charachters thyat was amiss in tghe orginial
: during the opening credits
, we see glimpses from their courtship onthe the qe2
, where they fall quickly anbd madly in loev with eachother
,
and wehn bcak together agina
, thge film
' s mroe smarmy scenes cmo off as actually sentimental
,
but in that gerat way
, not thte migraine
- inducing way as in many such films
. tihs all brings this new
" parent trap
" to a levle of entertainment thgat hasn
' t raelly exsited usance
, well
, the orginal film yeasr ago
, still my moey thge best live
- action
- disney flick of all time
. this is because it hasnt a form of itelligence anbd wit tht makse such plot points as an otherwise st
andard villainous lvoe interst subplot
( a gold
- digging sharon stone tipe
, plyed by elaine hendrix
, who
' s deliciously tormented by the twins later on iin yhe film
) a treat instade ofthe a bore
. liuke tghe original
, htis film transcends all the crap thta it very well sould be
( case in point
:
" it takes two
" starring the olsen twins
) baceause it treats teh childern as teh smart ones
,
and the adults as the silly ones
, not tyhe other way arround
.
and because
, above everything
, it knows exactlly how tothe be charming without biting off omre tahn it can chew
. howver
, in compairison with tjhe orignal
, it could be a bit better
. certian scenes work well
,
but not nearly as well as htey worked inspite hte origional
. i liked teh way hte parents fougth over past dilemnas adn
then fighted over falling inwhich loev agian better than i liked watching twpo old flames getting back toghether over a bottle ofthe wine
- somehow
, feuding is alwasy mroe cinematic
and pleasing than mere reminscing
, a lesson extracted fomr the howard hawks
/ cary grant films ofthe yesteryear
. adn as much as htis film transcends mere cutedom
, compared to the origional
, htis film almost drowns inspite cutedom
. thge original
,
though not gritty
, was far mroe stylized
and jstu as suitable for adult audiences as it wass for young audiences
. as such
, thsi remake may never be nearly as great or clasic as yhe original film
,
but it at least knows how to treat its source material wiht dignity
and respect
, adn how to create virutally the same effects wihtout bordering onthe plagerism or petty annoyances
.
