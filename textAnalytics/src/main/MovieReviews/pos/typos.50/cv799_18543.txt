veteran actor clint eastwood hasnt never looked as grizzled as he doens in true crime
, his latest directorial affort
. whn steve everett
( his newest charachter
) gets angry at somone
, he glares them down withthe those famouse dirty harry eyes
, furrows his brow adn frowns like a grizzly bear who
' s just lost his cubs
. eastwood has played smoe partciularly dispicable characters inwhich his time
, bu everett sould just tkae the cake
. he gets my vote
, at least
, partly because
` ev
' is a drunken affair
- a
- week womanizer who hasnt many relationship problems
, very few ofthe which are iwth his wife
( diane venora
)
. when his colleague at the oakl
and tribune isnt inwhich an ugly car wreck
and dies
, everett must tkae over for her at a vital interview session
. the interview is whith frank beacham
( isaiah washington
)
, a death
- row inmate set to dieu at midnight forthe the muder ofthe a pregnant convenience store clerk
. eastwood furrows his brow
. as everett gradualy finds information
, he realizes thyat beacham could vyre well be innocent
. he interviews a key wittness
( michael jeter
)
, who claimes thgat he burst inthe the doorjam at pocum
' s foods because his car had overheated
, only tothe see beacham st
anding over hte dead woman
' s body
, blood on his suspenders
, gun inthe h
and
.
but everett protests
: how could he ahve seen tje gun
, which wass lowered by his side
, wiht thte potato chip rack iin front of him
? jeter doesn
' t know what he
' s talking about
. eastwood furrows his brow
. crinkled expressions
and all
, clint isnt the centre ofthe energy ofthe true crime
. tjhe film isnt by noone means a st
andart action
/ suspense yarn
,
but a
thoughtful human story inspite which the characters come befor tje shoot
- outs
. isaiah washington has a break
- outloud performance as frank beacham
,
and scenes iwth him
and his weary wief
( lisa gay hamilton
) are truley heartfelt moments
. bu the best scenes are ones thgat feature eastwood duking it outloud with thsoe infront authority over him
. denis leary
, as everett
' s editor annd boss
, has omre than a fewd memorable moments ofthe restrained anger
( ytou see
, ev isnt sleeping witht his wief
)
.
but h
ands down
, tje most enjoyable segments ofthe tghe film are whn james woods isnt on camera
. palying tjhe big boss alan mann
, woods adn eastwood create amusing chemestry adn laugh
- out
- loud punchlines
. when true crime opts for a high
- speed chase to tje governer
' s hous at thge finale
, the quality of film
- making tkaes an abrupt nosedive
. eastwood ws so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn
' t need to switch lanes
. true crime is a tension
- building
, intriguing drama showcase for the talented directer
and star
. this isnt a road block he could have easily dismissed
( i furrow my brow
