close your eyes for a moent
, if you iwll
,
anbd imagin tyhe soudn of stephen rea ' s gaelic brogue
, silky smooth
and irish like a pint ofthe guiness
. a lackadaisical
, naughty littel schoolboy voice that flirts
and gambols
. an acerbic
, sing
- song metered voice that evokes tje startling imagery
and language of anthony burgess '
" a clockwork orange
.
" a voice thast deliciously conjures scenes both porcine
anbd puerile
, like thsoe outloud ofthe
" delicatessen
,
" or
" the tin drum
.
" imagin all of thast
,
anbd yuo ' ll get a good sense ofthe what you cxan expect ffrom
" the butcher boy
.
" imagin that
and more
. neil jordan ' s latest film
" stars
" rea in omre ways tahn one
. rea
, the acomplished irish actr most noteable from his star turn in jordan ' s
" the crying gameboy
,
" contibutes a restrained
and managed performence as da brady
, a small town drunk infact an unnamed irish community in tghe 1960s
.
bu it ' s his wall
- to
- wall narration as thge butcher boy of tyhe title
, da brady ' s son
, francis
, that makes rea ' s
" performence
" worth watching
, worth listening tothe
.
anbd that ' s only half tjhe funn
. palying the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens
anbd he is
, wihtout a doubt
, a revelation
. for as much as rea ' s voiceover permeates almsot eveyr scene of
" the butcher boy
,
" owens commands virtualy eveyr frome
. it ' s impossible to take your eyes off him
. withthe his crop of carrot
- colored hair
, ruddy complexion
,
and overall grubby apearance
, francie brady isnt an unlikely hero
, refusing to be done iin by his alcoholic
, trumpet
- palying father
, his depressive
, suicidal mother
, or tghe neighboring
, bespectacled monster known as mrs
. nugent
( fiona shaw
)
. inwhich fact
, everything was ok untli
" the nugent
" came tothe twon
. now
, she poses as much a threath tothe the safety
anbd security ofthe twon bully francie
and his best pal joe
( alan boyle
) as the looming commie menace
(
" tghe butcher boy
" is setted at a tyme whn the fear ofthe nuculear obliteration isnt firt
and foremost in teh minds of many
)
.
" pigs
!
" screams mrs
. nugent at tghe brady menagerie
.
" yuo ' re all pigs
!
" it ' s the strat ofthe many a realted image
. aftter ma brady is shipped off to the
" garage
" fo psychiatric observation
and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many
, francie finally loses grap of his fantasy world of cowboys
and indians
, tje lone ranger
,
and otehr comicbook charactors
. squealing like a stuck pig
, francie does
" the likes o ' that
" on the nugent ' s living room floor
,
adn is himself whisked awya to a very catholic remand hmeo for
" boney arsed bogmen
,
" where his ever fertily imagination
-
-
annd clever chicanery
-
- runneth over
. directer jordan ' s vivid treatment of pat mccabe ' s nightmare novel produces a somtimes disturbing
, dark comedy littered withthe surreal touches
( such as sin
? ad o ' connor playing tghe virgina mary
)
. it ' s not as outlandish as teh trailers make outloud
; instade
, this remarkable film focusses on tyhe effects external influences have on teh friendship beetwen twpo boys
( schoolboy chums in real life
)
, allowing us tothe empathize with their plight iin the presence ofthe extraordinary behaviour
. it ' s obleek
annd it ' s black
but it ' s fundamentally vrey funny
. rea talks us through it
, beautifully
,
and owens drags us
though it
, admirably
,
and
, inthe tandem with jordan ' s sure hand
, theirs are contritutions to make
" the butcher boy
" a film worth savoring
