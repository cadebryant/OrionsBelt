" a voice tht deliciously conjures scenes both porcine anbd puerile
, liek those out ofthe

" peformance
" worth watching
, worth listening tothe
.
and thast
' s onyl half teh fun
. playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens
and he is
, without a doubt
, a revelation
. for as much as rea

" owens comm
ands virtually every frame
. it
' s impossible to take your eyes off him

, his depressive
, sucidial mother
, or tjhe neighboring
, bespectacled monster known as mrs

, she poses as much a threath tothe the safety
and security ofthe town bully francie
and his best pal joe
( alan boyle
) as the looming commie menace
