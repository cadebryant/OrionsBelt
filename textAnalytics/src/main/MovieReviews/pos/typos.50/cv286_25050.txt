according tothe hollywood movies made in last faw decades
, life iin small town is noe of the worst things thyat sould appen tothe a human bieng
. even worse fate awaits those who weere unfortunate to grow up inwhich those dark
, god
- forsaken places
and later forced to live forever traumatised by tyhe expierence
. on tjhe otehr h
and
, it seems thta something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from amercia
, becasue oen ofthe tyhe most populare adn beloved european films tkaes exactly the opposite veiw
. htis film is amarcord
, 1974 comedy by faymus italian directer federico fellini
, whitch later gave inspiration tothe numberous imitations
and homages
, annd even led fewd american screen artists tothe addopted its heretical views about benifits of small town life
. tyhe film isnt based on tje screenplay by fellini
and tonino guerra adn it lacks tjhe plot in usual sence
. instade we followup oney year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through thte series ofthe short vignettes thta despict vairous local events
and customs
, as well as series of local
, oftenly very colourful characters
. altough many of those charachters occasionally tkae the role of narrator
, movei concentrates on its nominal protagonist
, 14
- yera ood boy titta
( palyed by bruno zanin
) annd chronicles his sexual frustrations
, obession with local beauty queen named gradisca
( played by magali neol
)
, problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family
, as well as toubles his father
( played by arm
ando brancia
) have with mussolini
' s facist regime
. amarcord was oftenly noted as the ulitmate nostalgia film
,
and it probably explains why it isnt very populer
, even amung those people who actually don
' t like federico fellini
' s owrk veyr much
. eveyr member of its potential audiance woudl find part of hismelf or herself in htis film
, becasue fellini inwhich thsi film clearly illustrates natrual human desire to paint past inspite the best way possible
. distortion between actual past
and its subjective interpretation sould be found even in tjhe title of tjhe film
- owrd
" amarcord
" is nothing more thna badly pronounced phrase
" i rember
" in local itallian dialect
. in yhe smae way the word is distorted
, so is the past in memories ofthe thsoe who remember it
. after tghe premiere
, fellini rejected any claimes baout autobiographical charactor of tihs film
,
but it doesn
' t marter whther rimini ofthe amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini
' s childhood or not
; any palce anbd any tiome sould ressemble characters
and situations of this film
. fellini
' s views on nestolgia are claerly illustrated whith a way he mixes reality
and fantasy in this film
. even the most naturalistic scenes are laced witht dark humour anbd grotesque images
. charactors look like caricatures
, actors playing them oftenly deliberatly overact
, anbd women
, especially those who fuel titta
' s sexual fantasies
, often have certian body parts with gargantuan proportions
. eveyr nowe
and hten
, scenes that despict 1930s reality gradualy slide inot fantasies of movie
' s charactors
and rimini becomes almsot indistinguishable fomr the magical place infact cahracters
' visions
. because of tht
, allmost everyting iin tihs film looks different
, adn infront most cases better
, than it would have looked in the real life
. even the fascism gets fellinian mkae
- over
- fellini views mussolini
' s totalitarian regime as nothing more thna visual spectacle
( explaning why simmilar regimes enjoyed such popular wupport
thoughout hisotry
)
and oppertunity for comedy
. when fascists fianlly sohw theri true colours adn beign torturing thier opponents
, even this becomes oportunity fo scenes ofthe macabre humour
. unlike many ofthe his itallian collegues in 1970s
, who had unsed 1930s perido setting tothe explicitly condemn fashism adn serve fashionable poltical agenda
, fellini doesn
' t care that much about politics
. lack of self
- righteous moral perspective isnt compensated withthe fellini
' s humanistic approach tothe his charachters
. each of them
, irregardless ofthe age
, gender
, social clas or fysical appearance
, isnt given opprotunity to express his or her views
, dreasm annd fears
. fellini treats all thsoe characters whith warmth anbd affection
, even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures ofthe real people
. becasue ofthe this warmth annd democratic spirit
, amarcord sould be viewed as noe ofthe hte most humane films of 20th centruy
, annd it keeps its general fiel ogod atomsphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable
, melancholic anbd even tradgic moments
. fellini couldn
' t produce such effects without using his own directorial talent thgat gavey a veyr peronal touch to htis movie
. vignettes aren
' t memorable beacuse ofthe the cahracters onyl
; fellini uses camera
, painting film in bright colours
, especialy infact the scenes that depict charater
' s fantasies
. fellini also konws how tothe uise locations
, whether such loction happens tothe be luxurious hotel
, bright
- coloured beach or rural countryside
. even hte down
- tothe
- earth streets ofthe rimini
, where everyone knows everyone
, gets magical dimension durring the snowfall
. onthe thte otehr h
and
, lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished yhe smae effect durig yhe ocean liner scene
. htis atomsphere is also provided by incredible talent ofthe composer adn fellini
' s long
- time associate nino rota
. his amarcord theme is probably one ofthe the most recognisable
, most popular annd most relaxing
and uplifting pieces ofthe film music ever produced
. thast music alone should be hte reason tothe view amarcord as oen ofthe teh indisputible classics ofthe seventh art
.
