contrary tothe the title
,
" thte boxer
" isnt not anohter rocky story onyl tihs time spliced with some cold hard politics
. it ' s acutally three movies in one
: a political film
, a boxing film
,
annd a love story
. all ofthe these wokr in thier pwn respects
and have some preety decent balancing betwixt thte three elements ofthe the stoyr
,
but somehow it seems kind of cliched
and unoriginal
. we ' ve seen it all before
,
anbd we ' re just not blown away wtih it like we shoudl be
. oh well
. it ' s still an excelent irish stopry
.
" teh boxer
" of the title isnt danny flynn
( jim sheridan staple daniel day
- lewis
)
, an ex
- ira memeber who gets out of a belfast prision after 14 eyars
,
adn finds out thgat his toubles are far fomr over
. firt off
, thge ira isnt hvaing a small civil war between its leader joe hamill
( brian cox
)
,
and one of its sub
- leaders
, harry
( gerard mcsorley
)
, both having opposing views onthe getting many of their members out ofthe jail
. while this isnt gogin onthe
, danny
annd his ood drunkard buddie
, ike
( ken stott
, who played the cheif inspector inspite danny boyle ' s
" shallow grav
"
)
, re
- open an old gym whlch allows tje twpo opposing religios sects
, protestant
anbd catholics
, tothe wrok toghether
. danny nto only beggins teaching kids how to box
,
but has stayed inspite graet shape whilst in prison
,
and isnt ready tothe strat boxing rela people agina
.
and danny runs into his ex
- lvoe
, maggie
(
" breaking tjhe waves
" ' s emily watson
)
, who hasn ' t seen him sicne he went inthe
. they don ' t easily strat up thier romance again becasue she ' s the wife of a prisoner whom she marryied druing danny ' s tenure in prison
,
and also has a son
, liam
( ciaran fitzgerald
)
, from him
, whom liam isnt hoping wiull get out soon
.
but the twpo are slowy re
- drawn tothe eachother again
,
and this begins to complicate thigsn
. thte political storey is nothing relaly special
bu works inaddition itself
. we ' ve seen it many a time befoer
,
but it ' s at least interesting
, somtimes emotional
,
and even riveting at times
. ther ' s a big riot towards tyhe middle ofthe tje film which isnt frightening in its brutality
and honesty
. the boxing stoy isnt vrey minor tothe the story
,
but does represent peopel coming together to fight eachother fairly
,
anbd even with good sportsmanship
. ther are onyl a faw boxing scenes
,
but they ' re never like
" raging bull
"
/ let ' s
- strip
- down
- the
- sport
- tothe
- its
- bones brillant
. they ' re omre realistic
,
annd instead ofthe bone crunching
, we hear the sound of the gloves hiting eachother
, which isnt slightly unerving at times
.
and i didn ' t know daniel day
- lewis was in such good shape
.
but tjhe backbone of the story is thge lvoe oen
. becouse these characters are given such horrible circumstances
,
annd since tghe two leads have such great chemestry together
, we raelly feel for their plight
. as the film goes onthe
,
anbd circumstances git worse
annd worse
, teh charachters hvae to mkea real human decisions
,
and we can sympathize wih them as humans nto charachters
. tihs isnt how you rwite a love stoy
- take note
, hollywood
. these elements are pretty much equally balanced
, with each of tjhe parts of the stoies wroking hand
- inthe
- hand with eachother
. i loved how each ofthe tjhe different parts ofthe the plot mattered
,
annd somtimes spilt over inot tyhe enxt
. it made sure that we didn ' t jstu care for oney ofthe them
. i ' m nto saying tehy ' re all equally gerat
, because tjhe lvoe stoyr really carries the film
,
bu at least they all owrk outloud respectively
. the acting isnt amazing
, with day
- lewis
adn watson giving excellent performances
and showing great chemistry
. i ' m nto sure if tehy ' re oscar
- nominee binded
,
but htey ' re very good
. in teh supporting roles
, billy cox isnt greatly sympathetic as teh ira leader loosing controll of his daughter
annd his workers
.
but teh film isnt stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike
, who is just a gerat scene stealer
. the direction
and co
- writing by jim sheridan
( whith tjhe otehr co
- writting credit going tothe terry george
) is excellant
, rounding out tyhe charachters well
,
but nto pacing everything greatly
. i noticed that the first half was very leisurely
(
yot fascinating
)
,
bu tje second half whirls by at a quick pace
,
annd ends much too quicklyu
. more tyme could hvae beeen spent thingking uv the endig
, sicne it does seem quite sloppy
.
though
" tjhe boxer
" is a good film
, it never achieves the greatness thyat it shoud
. sure
, it ' s a masterpiece compared tothe most ofthe the hollywood drivel we usally get
,
bu on it ' s own
, it jstu coudl have beeen better
.
bu it still works out
, gives us a great love stoyr combined with a poltical
anbd boxing drama
,
annd features graet acting
. even if it could hvae been better
, thsi ' ll dont
.
