contrary to tyhe title
,
" the boxer
" isnt nto anyother rocky stopry only htis tiome spliced with smoe cold hard politics
. it
' s atually threee movies inwhich oney
: a polliticel film
, a boxing film
,
and a love story
. all ofthe theese work in their own respects
and have some preety decent balancing betwixt the threee elements ofthe yhe story
, bu somehow it seems kind ofthe cliched
and unoriginal
. we
' ve seen it all befor
,
and we
' re just nto blown awya with it like we shoudl be
. oh well
. it
' s still an excellent irish stroy
.
" the boxer
" of tghe title isnt danny flynn
( jim sheridan staple daniel day
- lewis
)
, an ex
- ira member who gets out ofthe a belfast prison after 14 yersa
, anbd finds outloud that his troubles are far from over
. firt off
, tje ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill
( brian cox
)
, adn one ofthe its sub
- leaders
, harry
( gerard mcsorley
)
, both haveing opposing views on getting many ofthe their members outloud ofthe jail
. hwile this is oging onthe
, danny annd his ood drunkard buddie
, ike
( ken stott
, who played tje chief inspector in danny boyle
' s
" shallow grav
"
)
, re
- open an ood gym whihc allows yhe twpo opposing religios sects
, protestant
and catholics
, to work together
. danny nto only begins teaching kids how tothe box
,
but hasnt stayed inthe great shape whilst inwhich prision
, annd is ready tothe start boxing rela peple again
.
and danny runs inot his ex
- lveo
, maggie
(
" breaking the waves
"
' s emily watson
)
, who hasn
' t seen him usance he whent infront
. they don
' t easily strat uv thier romance again because she
' s the wife of a prisoner whom she married durring danny
' s tenture in prison
,
and aslo has a son
, liam
( ciaran fitzgerald
)
, from him
, whom liam is hoping will get out soon
. bu yhe two are slowy re
- drawed to eachother agian
, annd this begins tothe complicate things
. teh polliticel story is nothing really speical bu works inwhich itself
. we
' ve seen it many a time befoer
, bu it
' s at least intresting
, somtimes emotional
,
and even riveting at times
. htere
' s a big riot towards the middle ofthe the film which isnt frightening in its brutality
and honesty
. the boxing tsory is very minor to the story
,
but does represent peopel comming toghether to fight eachother fairly
, annd even with ogod sportsmanship
. ther are only a faw boxing scenes
, bu they
' re never like
" raging bull
"
/ let
' s
- strip
- down
- teh
- sport
- to
- its
- bones briliant
. htey
' re more realistic
,
and instead ofthe bone crunching
, we hear the sound of tghe gloves hitting eachother
, wich isnt slightly unerving at times
.
and i didn
' t know daniel day
- lewis was inwhich such ogod shape
.
but tje backbone ofthe teh stoy isnt the love oney
. because theese characters are given such horrible circumstances
,
and since hte two leads ahve such great chemestry toghether
, we relaly feel for their plight
. as the film goes onthe
,
and circumstances git worse
and worse
, tghe characters ahve tothe mkea rela human descisions
, adn we cant sympathize witht them as humans not characters
. tihs isnt how ytou write a lveo story
- tkae note
, hollywood
. these elements are pretty much equally balanced
, wiht each of tyhe parts ofthe tyhe stories working h
and
- inspite
- h
and with eachother
. i loved how each of tjhe differant parts of thge plot mattered
,
and somtimes spilled over inot teh enxt
. it made sure thgat we didn
' t jstu care fo noe ofthe them
. i
' m nto saying tehy
' re all equally great
, because tje lveo story really carries the film
, bu at least they all owrk out respectively
. the acting is amazing
, iwth day
- lewis
and watson giving excellent performances
and showing grat chemistry
. i
' m not sure if they
' re oscar
- nominee bound
,
but they
' re very good
. inaddition the supporting roles
, billy cox is greatly sympathetic as tje ira leader loseing control of his daughter annd his workers
.
but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike
, who isnt just a gerat scene stealer
. thte direction
and co
- writing by jim sheridan
( with the otehr co
- writing credit oging to terry george
) is excellent
, rounding out tghe cahracters well
, bu nto pacing everthing greatly
. i noticed that tje frist half wass vyre leisurely
(
yet fascinating
)
,
but the second half whirls by at a quick pace
,
and ends much too quicklyu
. more timne could have beeen spent thinking up the ending
, usance it does seem quite sloppy
.
though
" tyhe boxer
" is a good film
, it never acheives yhe greatness that it shoudl
. sure
, it
' s a masterpiece compared tothe most of tje hollywood drivel we usualy get
, bu on it
' s pwn
, it just coudl have been better
.
but it still works outloud
, gives us a grat lveo stor conbined with a polliticel
and boxing drama
, adn features great acting
. even if it coudl have beeen better
, this
' ll dont
.
