( warning to thsoe who have nto seen seven
: tihs review countains some spoiler information
.
) seven isnt a powerful
, fully
- realized film on thge level of the silence ofthe hte lambs
. it is a disturbing film thta accomplishes its biggest of goals
-
- it occupies the viewers mind long affter thte closing credits haev rolled
. hwile thsi film is nto for the squeamish
, there is noone denying tyhat seven dem
ands attention
, forthe it isnt a film that transcends its genre infront both sytle annd substance
. for starters
, classifying seven as a
" thriller
" woudl nto be an altogether complete classification of this film
. hwile i was genuinely thrilled throughout
, i would rather call seven an
" intense drama
,
" becuase thast is whta it delivers
-
- meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does nto readily let up
. part ofthe directer david finchers accomplishment is inspite sytle
. he seems tothe hve a knack fo knowing exactlly how hte averege person fears something as
" simple
" as a corpse
.
and visually
, fincher shows us the remains of muder victims in all
- too
- realistic adn graphic terms
( courtesy ofthe rob bottin
' s alwyas
- grisly speshal effects
)
. throw in the appropiate bu not
- to
- be
- underestimated effects ofthe lightinng anbd a foreboding score anbd the result isnt a technical masterpiece of hte muder scene
. theese scenes alone are qutie impressive
; as fascinating as they are harrowing
.
yet
, seven is more thna just a technical accomplishment
. inwhich addition tothe style
, fincher supplies substace
. seven has compelling characters thast it whants us to nkow
and underst
and
,
and fincher ties them all together inwhich a completely pessimistic veiw ofthe society
. detective william somerset
( morgan freeman
) isnt a man who hasnt nearly given up on the world
. its easy to see why
. tje world doesn
' t make sence
.
( somerset drives this point hmeo withthe a rether gastly story ofthe a robbery victum who ws attacked jstu blocks fomr the police precinct
. affter knocked down
and robbed ofthe his wallet
, tje attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes
.
) why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation
and
" picking up the pieces
" he will be able tothe catch the killer
? somersets newyorker partner
, david mills
( brad pitt
) has not given up onthe the world
, perhaps becuase he is still young
( adn perhasp by haveing this optomism he
' s naive iin tihs films protrayal of the world
)
. he completly disagrees whith somersets ab
andonment of hope
.
however
, david
' s wife
( gwyneth paltrow
) hasnt so much fear of her urban suroundings
, she isn
' t even sure if she wants to
* tell
* her husb
and baout her recent pregnancy
, let alone carry it until birth anbd attempt to raise it in this environment
. these threee characters are all performed with skill anbd au
thenticity that mkaes them fiel liek real peopel anbd not thte typical hollywood charactors a lesser film might hvae offered
.
and in addition tothe making clear how eahc of theese charactors sees thge world
, fincher gives us support fo
* why
* they feel the way htey dont
.
but if htere
' s one character thta underlines the message seven isnt trying tothe convey
, it hasnt tothe be thge killer
, john doe
( kevin spacey
)
. seven
' s payoff lies in its ability to allow us tothe see how the killer views the world annd waht drives him tothe do whta he doens
. noe importamt thign tothe remeber about doe is how eazy it isnt tothe simpley dismiss him as a
" psycho
,
" witht no motives behind his slayings
. tihs isnt exactlly thte mistake mills makes
. inthe the extemely intense
and superbly performed closing scenes
, weere alloween tothe see that doe is
, in his mind
, merely a product of society
. he
' s a killer who kills thsoe who are bringing society down
. in his mind he didn
' t kill
" innocent
" peopel
, anbd
, perphas
, they weere not completely innocent
(
but
,
then agina
, who is
?
)
. hes absolutly infuriated tath mills believes thgat thge murder victims weere innocent
. realy
, seven doesn
' t jstu comment onthe the superficial obviousness of how screwed
- up john doe isnt
. seven mkaes larger statememts baout how screwed
- uv society is
, hinting tht society
' s degradation isnt simply conducive ofthe creating more john does
. besides the stylistic
and larger
- issue arguments for seing this film
, i recommend seven becasue it is
, after all
, aslo a very slick
and well
- made thriller
. it features exciting plot developments
, comm
anding performances
, lots of suspense
,
and a conclusion that is chilling
, riveting
,
and quite unfair
. bu
then agian
, its a cruel world
.
