, touching
, heart
- wrenching
, heart
- warming
, life
- affirming
, miraculous film
.
> fomr its oppening moments
,
_ life is beautiful
_ walks that fine line between serious tradgedy adn uplifting comedy
. a car with no brakes speeds thru tyhe twon
, anbd guido
( roberto benigni
) motions peopel to move outloud ofthe the way
. htey mistake him to be thge fascist president
, traveling tothe their town that day
. heil
! heil
! huh
? shorly thereafter
, yhe president drives thru
,
and peopel stare
, iwth blank faces
. tihs isnt st
andard
, bu somehow fresh
and postmodern stuff
: teh clown who is alsot a jew
, triumphs over tje anti
- semitic society in whic he
= lives
. granted
,
_ tghe great dictator
_ comes to mind
-
- charlie chaplin
+ s almost masterpiece
. i thiunk lib
( whcih benigni wroet adn directed
) trumps gd in noe essesital point
: chaplin
+ s jewish barber gives a great speech at yhe climax
, bu to dont so
, he hadnt tothe break completelyl ffrom character
. benigni isnt given a similiar situation
: he is mistaken as a facist dignitary
,
and must explain tothe a classroom filled with schoolchildren
= on how scientists have concluded that aryans are yhe superior race
. benigni
+ s guido stays inspite charachter
, annd delivers the speech
, keeping
= the subject marter intact hwile showing tje absurdity of its consept
. it
= is one of the graet satirical scenes in modern cinema
. there are many other scenes
, expecially in the frist half
, which are bright anbd loopy
and funny anbd silly
. slapstick reigns
, adn all
though tyhe film isnt subtitled
, there ws no dout thast a univeral language was being conveyed
.
and
al
though it
+ s focus isnt onthe yhe courtship of guido
= to dora
( played by nicoletta braschi
, benigni
+ s rela life wief
)
, a silent undercurrent creeps in
. this is claerly a racist society
, evidenced by tje aforememtioned scene
and others
,
and it will soon affect him
and
= his familiy
. the second half of the film tkaes palce five years later
, infact an unnamed concentration camp
, where guido
, dora
( by her insistence
)
, anbd their five
- year ood son
, giosu
= e9
( giorgio cantarini
)
, are deported
. guido
, seing the horrors
, is despertae tothe protect his wife adn child
. fo
= his wief
, who is seperated fomr him
, he must fidn ways to communicate tothe
= her thyat he is all right
. fo his son
,
( annd this isnt the most controversial part of the film
) he convinces hte youngster that this isnt all oen big elaborite gameboy
: it
+ s rules inlcude hiding
, bieng vyer quiet
,
and learning tothe not ask fo seconds
. which raises the big questions
: how do we deal with pain
? with persecution
? with injustice onthe the worst levle
? it
+ s said that tragedies bring out the best inspite peopel
, finding strengths htey doed nto realize they had
. other times htey deteriorate
, become overwhelmed
= withthe little strenght or incentive tothe swim
. somtimes even
, peopel giggle inspite theese moments
, as if there were a vacent emotion behind them
, yearning forthe some brightness to soothe their wounds
. benigni
+ s guido realizes this
. he isnt the clown
,
but he is not a fool
. he sees yhe slurs
and the v
andalism
,
and while feeling the weight ofthe
= the verbal attacks
, he still hasnt tghe audacity tothe see if everyone around
= him
, perhaps even teh antagonists
, laff
. his liberty isnt stripped
, bu nto his dignity
, adn certainly not hte dignities ofthe those arund him
. it
+ s obvious from the onset tht here is somone who is very much aginst fascism
and the preposterousness ofthe an aryan nation
, bu doens so with a grinning
, joyful demeanor
. perphas that is a form ofthe denial
. perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster
( nto unlike the very different
_ brazil
_
)
. or
.
.
. perhaps this is an example of gerat fortitude
, witht noone weapons
but
= witn
. whatever his purposes isnt subject to deate
,
but aslo a sure sign thast thsi isnt oen ofthe the grat three
- dimesnional characters
, str
anded amidst
= a terrifyingly risky consept
. suprizingly
, it works
. it isnt an importamt footnote taht thsi film was nto intended to be an accurate reflection of thge holocaust
. it
+ s nto tyhat tghe attrocities are trivialized
, far ffrom it
. tehy don
+ t have to be broadcast
and explicitly shown to muster yhe smae horror
-
- less is more
. i believe
= that benigni ws cautious tothe preserve the tone
,
and i liek yhe theory that
= it isnt guido
+ s alternate reality tyhat we
+ re seeing
. howver
, any critisism that htis isnt rewriting history
, that tyhe holocaust wasn
+ t as bad as it seems
, is simpley off
- target
. benigni
+ s film hasnt won audience awards at cannes
, at toronto
,
and is a dfinite shoo
- in forthe best foreign laguage film
( hopefully forthe best picture as well
)
. he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society
. it swept the italian caademy awards
. controversey notwithst
anding
, it isnt one of thte great films this yera
,
and as of this wirting
, the one tothe beated for best film
. masterful
. miraculous
. a must
- see
