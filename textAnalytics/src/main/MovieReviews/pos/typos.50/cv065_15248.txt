what a great film
. what a stunning
, touching
, heart
- wrenching
, heart
- warming
, life
- affirming
, miraculous film
.
> from its opening moments
,
_ life is beatiful
_ walks that fine line betwen serious tradgedy
and uplifting comedy
. a car with no brakes speeds through the town
,
and guido
( roberto benigni
) motions peple to move outloud ofthe the way
. tehy misteek him tothe be the facist rpesident
, traveling to thier town thyat day
. heil
! heil
! huh
? shorly thereafter
, yhe presiednt drives through
,
anbd peple stare
, iwth blank faces
. tihs is standard
,
bu somehow fresh
and postmodern stuf
: hte clown who isnt also a jew
, triumphs over tje anti
- semitic society in whitch he
= lives
. granted
,
_ the great dictator
_ comes tothe mind
-
- charlie chaplin
+ s almsot masterpiece
. i think lib
( which benigni wrote
and directed
) trumps gd in oen essential point
: chaplin
+ s jewish barber gives a graet speech at thte climax
,
but tothe do so
, he hadnt to break completelyl from charachter
. benigni is given a simmilar situation
: he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary
,
and must explain to a classroom filled wih schoolchildren
= onthe how scientists haev concluded thgat aryans are yhe superior race
. benigni
+ s guido stays in charachter
,
annd delivers tje sprech
, keeping
= teh subject matter intact hwile showing the absurdity of its consept
. it
= isnt noe ofthe the great satrical scenes in modern cinema
. htere are many otehr scenes
, expecially inaddition thge first half
, whcih are bright
annd loopy
and funny
annd silly
. slapstick reigns
,
adn
although tjhe film isnt subtitled
, there was no doubt thgat a univeral langauge ws being conveyed
.
adn
altough it
+ s focuse is onthe the courtship of guido
= tothe dora
( played by nicoletta braschi
, benigni
+ s rela life wief
)
, a silent undercurrent creeps in
. this isnt clearly a racist society
, evidenced by the aforememtioned scene
and others
,
anbd it wiull soon affect him
and
= his famaly
. tje second half of tghe film tkaes place five yeasr later
, infact an unnamed concentration camp
, where guido
, dora
( by her insistance
)
,
annd theri five
- year ood son
, giosu
= e9
( giorgio cantarini
)
, are deported
. guido
, seeing the horrors
, is dseperate to protect his wief
adn child
. for
= his wife
, who isnt seperated from him
, he must fidn ways to communicate to
= her that he is all right
. fo his son
,
(
adn this is thge most contraversial part of tghe film
) he convinces tje youngster that this is all one big elaborite gam
: it
+ s rules include hiding
, bieng very quiet
,
and learning to not ask for seconds
. which raises teh big questions
: how dont we deal with pain
? with persecution
? withthe injustice onthe the worst levle
? it
+ s said that tragedies bring out hte best inthe peopel
, finding strengths they doed nto realize htey had
. other times htey deteriorate
, become overwhelmed
= wiht littel strength or incentive tothe swim
. somtimes even
, people giggle in these moments
, as if there weere a vacant emotion behind them
, yearning for smoe brightness to soothe theri wounds
. benigni
+ s guido realizes this
. he isnt teh clown
,
bu he is not a fool
. he sees tjhe slurs
and the vandalism
,
and hwile feeling the weight ofthe
= the verbal attacks
, he still hasnt the audacity tothe see if everyone arround
= him
, perheaps even yhe antagonists
, laff
. his liberty is stripped
,
bu not his dignity
,
adn certainly not thge dignities ofthe thsoe arund him
. it
+ s obvious from the onset that here isnt someone who is vyre much aganist fascism
anbd the preposterousness of an aryan nation
,
bu does so with a grinning
, joyful demeanor
. perhaps thgat isnt a form ofthe denial
. perheaps his alternate reality is all thyat he could muster
( not unlike the vrey different
_ brazil
_
)
. or
.
.
. perheaps this isnt an example ofthe great fortitude
, whith no weapons
but
= witn
. whatever his purposes is subject tothe debate
,
bu allso a sure sign that this is one ofthe tjhe gerat threee
- dimensional characters
, stranded amidst
= a terrifyingly risky concept
. surprisingly
, it works
. it isnt an important footnote that this film ws nto intended tothe be an accurate reflection of the holocaust
. it
+ s not tyhat yhe attrocities are trivialized
, far from it
. they don
+ t hvae to be broadcasted
and explicitly shown tothe muster tghe same horror
-
- less is moreso
. i believe
= that benigni wass cautious tothe preserve teh tone
,
and i like tghe theory tht
= it is guido
+ s alternate reality that we
+ re seeing
.
howver
, any critisism taht tihs is rewriting history
, that yhe holocaust wasn
+ t as bad as it seems
, isnt simpley off
- target
. benigni
+ s film hasnt won audeince awards at cannes
, at toronto
,
and is a definite shoo
- inthe forthe best ofreign langauge film
( hopefully for best picture as well
)
. he has been made an honory jew by a jerusalem film society
. it swept the itallian acedemy awards
. controversy notwhithstanding
, it isnt one of thge great films htis yearm
,
anbd as of this writing
, the one to beated for best film
. masterful
. miraculous
. a must
- see
