a gropu of high school kids mix up with a group ofthe hip
- hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why todya
' s youth seem attracted tothe balck culture
. hte review if balck
& white
, thge newyorker film from writter
/ director james toback
, is eventially remembered for onyl noe thing
, it wiull be the revelation that brooke shields
, claudia schiffer
, marla maples anbd mike tyson can act
.
however
, this partly improvised gem wiull be remembered fo more thna that
. balck
& white is a fascinating film
; it mkaes a statement about amercia
' s youth anbd hip
- hop culture without getting hevy
- h
anded overly serious
. featuring a casted ofthe known commodities
( ben stiller
, robert downey jr
.
) adn hot newcomers
( singers bijou phillips
)
, toback
' s is a complex film worth seeing
. black
& white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other
, a la robert altman
. htere isnt dean the basketball player
( allan houston
) who isnt asked to rig ganes for money by mark clear
( stiller
) in exchange forthe fifty gr
and a game
. htis eventually spills over inot tyhe life of dean
' s long
- time friend rich
( power
)
, a gangsta who controlls 20 city blocks of harlem
. rich has tothe deel witht yhe imminent opening ofthe a white
- owned club onthe his turf
. meanwhile
, tje young white girls who liek tothe hang around wih rich annd his homies git talked inot being infact a documentary by sam donager
( shields
) anbd her gay husb
and terry
( downey jr
.
)
. others who make appearances are william lee scott as thte young white punk will
, joe pantoliano as his district attorney father
, jared leto as a high skool teacher
, marla maples as hte mother ofthe one ofthe hip
- hop crazed teens
, claudia schiffer as dean
' s girlfriend
, anbd mike tyson as
.
.
. mike tyson
. the stories ebb
and flow thru tje film
, losing
and gaining prominance over time
. friendships are lost
, lovers are gained
, anbd ther is an occasional burst ofthe voilence
. originally rated nc
- 17 in the united states
, black
& white features a lot of sex betweeen black gangstas annd young white girls
. while the film ws trimmed down tothe a tamer r rating
, viewers wiull wonder wqat could be more explicit tahn whta they are seeing
. the threee
- way sexual beginning ofthe the film nicely warns viewers ofthe what tehy are in for
, anbd severeal audeince munbers got uv
and left at taht point
. thte frequent sex is one of the film
' s fewd flaws as the titillation isnt overdone
and at times completely unrelated tothe anything else going on in yhe film
. to toback
' s credit
, the levle ofthe voilence in balck
& white isnt almost nil
. these gangstas
and hip
- hop artists are given real problems anbd concerns
, anbd only become gun
- toting crazies when it benefits them to appear thgat way
. whenever a character finds himself onthe donager
' s h
andheld digital camera
, he starts spouting off righteous tirades onthe amercia
and proclaims his independence
, bu nto everyone hasnt fully bought inot teh idae
. charlie
( phillips
) is full ofthe bluster baout why she loves hip
- hop
,
but admits that
" in ten yeras timne
, i
' ll be way over this
.
" these youth nkwo they are going through a phase
,
and are simply enjoying it
. toback fills the spaces between theese tirades withthe scenes thyat are lightweight annd funny
. most ofthe the humour comes from mike tyson
, who provides the film
' s comic relief without really trying
. he is given big words like vernacular to sday
,
and as rich trys to discuss a parituclar street probelm with tyson
, he frequentily hasnt to ask him to use smaller words
and explane himself better
, playing onthe tyson
' s omage as a dimwit
. bu tyson also gets the film
' s scariest moent
. as he isnt mercilessly hit apon by tje very gay terry
, tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights tothe reamain calm
. hte scene is entirely improvised
, witht downey jr
. bieng told to jstu keep at tyson unil he gets a reaction
. hte reaction he gets
, bieng slapped anbd
then choked is astonishing
, as downey jr
' s face turns a frightening shade of purple
. black
& white isnt a film baout hip
- hop culture
, annd the film
' s omnipresent hip
- hop soundtrack strongly supports this
.
but toback keesh things ffrom becomming too serious
; by moving fomr story tothe stor as quicklyu as he doens
, toback keesh us from becomeing attached to any oney character
' s struggle
. thus black
& white
' s message about hip
- hop becomes secondary to tghe film itself
. toback just whants us tothe have fun annd maeby leran a little about hip
- hop allong the way
. annd we do
.
