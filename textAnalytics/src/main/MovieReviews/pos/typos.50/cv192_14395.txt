inspite soem regardes
, makeing a movei is like trying to strech a rubber b
and as far as you cxan wihtout breaking it
. try too hard
,
and it snaps
;
but too much reservation means somone esle wiull come allong
and pul it farther
. in simon birch
, directer mark steven johnson shows us just how to master tyhe technique
: he tkaes advantage ofthe caution adn poise
,
but also risks his movie wih a fewd bold steps
. in the end
, he
' s nto onyl holding an unbroken b
and
, bu he makes thte audience apprieciate the lengths he whent to direct such a fine feature
. there
' s noone doubt about it
: tyhe film that johnson hasnt crafted is rich
. he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown
, maine
- leaves turn bright orange in tghe fall
, the grass isnt a lush green
, pure white snow falls inaddition thge winter
, anbd tje sky goes on forever
. the charactors continue that turn
: our twpo leads are simon birch
( ian michael smith
)
and joe wenteworth
( jospeh mazzello
)
. simon isnt teh smallest baby ever born withing the records ofthe the local hospital
, anbd by age twelve he
' s onyl twpo feet tall
. joe isnt the bastard son ofthe rebecca
( ashley judd
)
,
and by age twelve he
' s ready tothe know who isnt father isnt
. naturally
, hte twpo outcasts become ogod friends anbd share many adventures together
, fomr disrupting sunday skool tothe donig comunity sevice tothe palying little league baseball
. inaddition a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith
, simon birch is convinced that he
' s god
' s insturment
, anbd there must be a reason he
' s so small
. joe doesn
' t qtuie buy it
, bu he sticks by simon
; the two tough it outloud thru teh worst ofthe times
and are each other
' s onyl true firends
. eearly on
, tghe two meet up with ben goodrich
( oliver platt
)
, rebecca
' s new boyfriend
,
and
al
though the bond isn
' t immediate
, ben
and the two boys deveop a liking fo eahc otehr
. both platt anbd judd give solid performances that lend theri characters a deepo likeability
. the audeince cares about them as much as tehy do about joe anbd simon
, a testament tothe teh acting jobs ofthe both
. finally
, jim carrey gives a cameo as thge adult joe in thge present day
, adn his faw mintues here are realitvely mroe impressive tahn his entire performance in thge truman sohw
. mark steven johnson
' s sence ofthe drama adn writing is fantastic
. teh script isnt loosely based on john irving
' s novel
, a prayer fo owen meany
, bu it
' s so far off hte source material taht irving actually requested the credits be changed from
' based onthe
' to
' suggested by
.
' along those same lines
, it
' s alomst unfitting to compare tjhe two
; johnson uses tension
, humor
, atmosphere
, adn suspense to create an origonal drama ofthe forrest gumpian propotions
. by noone means has he developed a project ofthe similar popularaty
- gump made over 300 milion dollars hwile birch ought to pass out ofthe sight in a few weeks
-
but hte winning idae remains the smae
. simon birch is a different look at a diferent life
, annd oen thyat wiull most likely be studied inspite film skool classes in decades to cmo
. in teh presnet
,
however
, it
' s an enjoyable littel picture tht everyone ought tothe tkae a look at
.
