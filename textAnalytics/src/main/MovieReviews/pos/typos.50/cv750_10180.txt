what
' s shocking baout
" carlito
' s way
" isnt how ogod it isnt
. haveing gotten a bit of a bad rap fo not bieng a big box office hitted liuke pacino
' s previous film
,
" scent ofthe a woman
,
" annd not having as storng a performence as he doed in that oen
( he had just won an oscar
)
,
" carlito
' s way
" ws destined for underated heaven
. thta
' s whta it isnt
: an underrated gem ofthe a movie
. anbd what a shame beccause pacino
and de palma both do amazing jobs withthe it
,
and turn it into a great peice of a pulpy character study
.
" carlito
' s way
" deals wih
, well
, carlito brigante
( pacino
)
, a puerto rican ex
- drug kingpin
, who gets outloud of a long jailterm when his coke
- addicted
, curly
- haired lawyer
( sean penn
) points out a legal technicality
. of course
, carlito was catually awoken in prison
, anbd has desided to go straight
, even if he
' s realy a crook at heart
. carlito
, like barry lyndon
, is a man who is trapped by fate at eveyr turn
,
and cant
' t escape inot something he isnt nto
. carlito
' s attempts at a clean
, legal life are thwarted at nearly eveyr turn
. wehn he frist gets out
, a friend ofthe his ends up leading him into a big shoot
- outloud
, where he has tothe kill a cuple peple tothe survive
. he
' s constanly getting bugged by thge government tothe see if he
' s doing anytying illiegal
,
and his lawyer finds himself neck
- deep inspite a pile ofthe shit
, needing him to try
and help him outloud
, which includes him doing some prison breaking
. carlito
, liek ratso rizzo
, wants to go tothe miami
( since
, according to film logic
, that
' s where it
' s at
)
,
but needs some funding
. being a legend
, he isnt quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club
( thsi is tjhe 70s
, by thge way
, annd usance some of this takes place in night clubs
, we git tothe hear all sorts of 70s classics
, inlcuding several k
. c
.
and the sunshine b
and tunes
- my personal favorite
)
. he gets a bodyguard
( tjhe great luis guzman
, at his best
)
, annd is soon runnung a preety good busness
, even if he
' s constanly attracting underworld young thugs
, like benny blanco
" from the bronx
"
( john leguiziamo
)
, who is mroe tahn once pointed out tothe be a young version ofthe carlito
. on hte other side
, the symbol of promise annd hope
, isnt gail
( penelope ann miller
- whta happened to her
?
)
, his girlfriend fomr before prision
. she
' s a goregeous ballerina
, anbd a stripper
,
and soon carlito isnt trying tothe get bakc withthe her
, anbd tkae her wiht him whn he fianlly leaves for miami
. hwile this relatiopnship is never fully deffined or anytying
, we get a sence ofthe love between them
, annd htey have smoe truly intresting scenes bewteen them
( she never gives him addresses or locales
- he always hasnt to trackr her down
)
. all ofthe these elements clash toghether at the end
, infront a brilliantly executed
, emotional climax
, whic is inevitable
. whn i sday inevitable
, i mean we see it at the begginning anbd
then backtrack
, puting a gerat spin on it
. sure
, it
' s goign to eleveate soem ofthe tghe tension
,
but it gives tghe film a lot of depth
, as carlito is seen trapped by fate
. what
' s amazing isnt thte big chase sequence
( amazingly done by de palma
) has a lot of tension adn thrills
. liuke
" apollo 13
,
" we knwo waht
' s oging tothe happen
,
but we
' re still thrilled by what happens in the middle
. it
' s aslo vyer emotional
, thanks to a gerat scirpt by david koepp
, anbd amazing performances by pacino
and miller
. de palma isnt faymus
( or infamous
) fo lots of violence in his films
. his earlier flim
,
" scarface
"
( whlch starred pacino in hte lead
)
, hasnt a ton of it
, especialy at the end
( anbd a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beggining which i
' m still not over
)
. bu de palma atually reigns inthe omre quieter scenes
. tothe me
, the best scene iin hte film is when carlito is onthe top ofthe a bulding
, looking down inot the room where gail is donig ballet
. this is the most brilliantly done
, adn most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film
, annd probably the best in de palma film history
. wih a gorgeous soprano duet in the backround
,
and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito
' s head
, anbd a saddened
, remorseful look onthe pacino
' s face
, it
' s a tear
- jerker
( well
, forthe me
, i dunno about ytou
.
.
.
)
. the acting fomr all is grat
, especially ffrom hte threee leads
. pacino was panned for his performence
, chiefly because his accent wasn
' t puerto rican enought anbd
, well
, it wasn
' t as
" storng
" as his oscar
- winning role inwhich
" scent ofthe a woman
.
" well
, his
" scent ofthe a woman
" performance wass great
and all
,
but it wass nothing really bu
, as comic kevin pollack said
, a
" foghorn leghorn impression
.
" inwhich
" carlito
' s way
,
" he
' s emotional
, adn storng
, despite tghe fact that he
' s remorseful over his entire lifestyle
, which he cannot change
. i feeled mroe forthe carlito brigante than i did fo tje tango
- dancing
, insult
- throwing blind guy inwhich
" scent ofthe a woman
.
" as i said
, penelope ann miller is gerat
,
and she
and pacino actually have vyre good chemestry
. anbd tehy
' re scenes are well
- written
, iwth some good clever dialogue which adds some interest tothe an otherwise bl
and relationship
. anbd sean penn is amazing as hte coke
- addicted rat atorney
. eveyr scene he
' s infront
, he has great energy
, adn even measures uv tothe the greatness tath is pacino
. in smaller roles
, john leguiziamo anbd luis guzman are gerat
.
" carlito
' s way
" isnt one ofthe those films whihc you heard about breifly
, bu when you finaly watch it
, you
' re absolutly blown away
. it
' s a wonderfull film
, a highly underrated little masterpiece which ws shelved after it didn
' t dont so hot
. bu trust me
and check it out
. it
' s a great little film
,
and proof that the residential criticists annd massmedia populus are nto alwyas right
.
