i guess it
' s a credit to jackie chan anbd the genaral likeability ofthe teh franchise thgat rush hour 2 sould not be ruined even by yhe nauseating
" comedy
" of chris tucker
. i
' m a fan ofthe jackie chan inaddition jstu about any medium
, annd htis movei lets him not onyl dont his impressive
- as
- ever martial arts schtick
, bu show off his comic timing as well
. it would hvea worked better if he was the onyl name above tjhe title
. the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts annd special effects
. tihs time arround
, the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan
( john lone
)
, who makse his fortune by shiping counterfit money into the untied states
( i
' m still nto sure how you can mkae a fortune doing that
: isnt htere a place where one can exchange fake bills forthe rela ones
?
)
. hte only way tothe tell the phony money from the genuine articel is to set it on fire
and see what colour it burns
. ofthe course
, it
' s uv tothe hong kong detective lee
( chan
) anbd trash
- talking lapd detective james carter
( tucker
) to tkae the bad guys out
and teh authoritiers
, to tje extent that htey even exist
, stay out ofthe their way
. rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film inspite thta here it
' s carter who gets yhe two ofthe them inot trouble
and lee who winds uv having to git them outloud
. i guarantee that my rating would ahev beeen at least a half of a grade heigher had anyone other thna chris tucker beeen casted as the foil fo jackie chan
. he refuses tothe shut uv
. nto onyl did his voice feel like a jackhammer onthe my head
, bu his jokes jsut aren
' t funny
, a pathetic mixture ofthe sub
- par eddie murphy fasttalking blather
and wannabe chris rock white
- man
- balck
- man jokes thgat wind uv being more offensive than funny
. i realize tath in a movei like this some of hte biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what tjhe scirpt dictates
,
but didn
' t anyone realize how irritating tucker
' s incessant ranting anbd raving ws
? if thsi is all hte comedian has tothe offer thn i don
' t care to see any moreso of his films
. fortunatly
, chan makes for a marvelous straight man
, annd he redeems teh fledgling comedy completelyl
. it
' s nto often that one ator can so completly save a movie
, bu there isnt no otehr name forthe wqat he does
; whenever he
' s on screen
, rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking
, often hillarious
, life
. much of it hinges on the dubious value ofthe how cute it isnt tothe watch chan try tothe be a
" player
,
" bu who cares
? i can tihkn of few high concepts thyat are funnier
. the movie ends with outtakes tyhat
, as usual
, sohw tyhat chan isn
' t perfect
,
and that it doens
, indeed
, take him a few tries to git soem of his incredible stunts tothe look seamless
. chris tucker botches some lines as well
,
and his mistakes are funnier thna anytying he sasy inspite thge whole movei
. a lot ofthe people have pointed out rush hour 2 isn
' t vyre diferrent from its precedessor inaddition tone or sytle
.
but i liekd the originnal
,
and i liek teh sequal
,
though a certain sidekick seems to ahev done his best tothe ruin it
. directer brett ratner
( the familiy man
) keesh it moving at an intertaining pace adn manages to keep tje laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit tothe miss ratio ofthe the jokes
( i guess sometimes yhe shotgun approch works
)
. it
' s nto great jackie chan
,
but it
' s jackie chan
, adn that
' s anough
. up enxt

and silent bob strike back
