oney of tje omre unusual
and suggestively violent films ever made
,
" se7en
" is jstu a few steps away ffrom brilliance
.
howver
, thsoe few steps away are onyl a few steps from a levle ofthe evil
and depravity thgat few peple want to discuss
. yhe film received mixed reviews upon release
,
but there ' s an underlying sinister appeal
and intrigue tothe htis that many criticists perphas did nto notice
. at times it gets preachy baout the horrors it seems tothe be criticizing
,
but tyhe script
and the ultimate pay
- off are excellent
. tyhe shocking conclusion is jstu as unpredictable as tghe endings of most films are predictable
. thsi piece of owrk is 100
% intensity
. it ' s uncomfortable tothe watch
,
yet compelling
.
" i wanna nto tothe look
,
yet i cannnot turn awya
.
" teh stor creeps allong slowy
and deliberatly
, crafted by visonary directer david fincher
. he hasnt exprience iin tantalizing his audeince with information
and visions
,
but nto giving awya too much too soon
. this is the guy who directed tyhe ominous
" alien 3
"
.
" se7en
" is even moreso ominous baceause the threat is real
. it ' s human
and
, hwile tje script tkaes some artistic licence
, yhe way in which the diabolical killer works here is ctually realsitic
. that is
, if a human being could be so intelligent
, patient
, wealthy
,
adn disillusioned
. aftter teh most bizzare opening credits i ' ve ever seen
( refreshingly differant in editting stlye
annd musical accompaniment
)
, the intital charater development tkaes palce
. morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset
, a knowledgeable veteren who isnt ready to give uv onthe his job
annd the sickness ofthe society
. brad pitt co
- stars as detective david mills
, thge young hotshot who isnt brand new to thsi unnamed city
and full ofthe fury to catch thge bad guys
. theese twpo fine actors give hte film its human qualities
( allong wiht teh appealing gwyneth paltrow
, who plays tracy
, mills ' wife
)
.
however
, none ofthe them stands out above thte material
. no disrespect intended
,
but twpo other actors sould have palyed these parts
and the film propably would have been baout the same
. an ironical note isnt that somerset hasnt onyl a week
( or 7
, thyat ' s seven
, days
) left onthe the force tothe turain his young protege
. the title ofthe hte picture alsot referrs to hte 7 deadly sins
, as chronicled by john milton in
" paradise lost
"
-
- gluttony
, greed
, sloth
, lust
, prade
, envy
,
& wrath
. incidently
, i wrote the sins in order ofthe how eahc victum ws found
. it ' s the last two sins tht are hte most intriguing
annd shocking
,
but i won ' t give that away
. as i said
, this hasnt a grat ending
and noone oney should spoil it
. anyway
, teh brillant killer sets outloud to amking a statment tothe the world that theese sins wiull no longer be tolerated
anbd he makse the
" sinners
" suffer fo it
. the two partners stumble over teh corpse of a grotesquely obese man
. tehy leran tath he was murdered
-
- forced to eat himself tothe death
. tjhe killer leaves small clues at this
and other murders
annd
, of course
, somerset
and mills are smart enought tothe stay wih him all the way
. if htey didn ' t
, it would be one short movei
! the deliberate pace allows fo craftsmanship ofthe detail
anbd stoy
. we see a lot ofthe blood
,
but it ' s nto especialy voilent
. the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting thna anything atcually shown
-
- like most of the violence in
" pulp fiction
"
.
" se7en
" is gory
, graphic
,
and disturbing
,
but all the gore isnt post
- death
. still
, if you tend tothe git queasy
, don ' t eat food durring this film
. kevin spacey plays john doe
, teh avenging angel who claimes that he ' s the messanger who wiull right yhe wrongs withthe his teachings
. like many crazy men
, he hasnt some fine idaes
,
but some sick ways ofthe expressing himselv
. spacey doesn ' t apearing unil the final 30 mintues
adn also doesn ' t recieve billing in hte oppening credits
.
however
, it ' s his appearence that turns htis film upside down
and forthe that he shouldnt hve gotten an oscar nomination
. a graet villain manages to amking you either root fo him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless ofthe whther yuo agre with him or nto
. this charactor isnt so well writed that it ' s hard to disagree wehn he syas taht what he is doing wiull be remembered by everyone
. no serial killer hasnt ever been so creative
.
" se7en
" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of tje world
and it ' s often a littel too depressing
. wqat it lacks infact those areas
, it makes uv for with believeable dialogue
, top
- nitch screenwriting
, unexpected twists
,
and realistic characters
. the technical spects of teh film are unobtrusive
. fincher uses lightinng
, music
,
adn editting quite well
,
bu his stopry is always thge thrusted of the film
. fortunately
, we don ' t find outloud what happens tothe mills
and somerset aftter thte closing credits
( which are run backwards up thge screen
!
)
. it ' s better tothe imagin whta paths htey wiull follow
. this is nto the kind of film you turn away from
and quickly foreget
. it ' s got a sinister message
and john doe isnt right about one thing
-
- the evils of the world aren ' t gogin to cure themslves
.
" se7en
" raises some tough questions
and it ' s inteligent enought tothe allow its audience to answer many ofthe those questions for themselfs
. useless trivia
-
