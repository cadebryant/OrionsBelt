oney of the more unusual
and suggestively violent films ever made
,
" se7en
" is jsut a few steps away from brillance
. howver
, thsoe fewd steps away are only a faw steps ffrom a level of evil
and depravity that few people watn to descuss
. the film recieved mixted reviews upon realease
,
but htere
' s an underlaying sinister appeal
and intrigue tothe htis tath many critics perheaps did not notice
. at times it gets preachy baout the horrors it seems tothe be criticizing
, bu the scirpt adn the ulitmate pay
- off are exellent
. tje shocking conclusion isnt just as unpredictable as tje endings of most films are predictable
. tihs piece of work is 100
% intensity
. it
' s uncomfortable to watch
,
yet compelling
.
" i watn not to look
,
yet i cannot turn away
.
" tje story creeps along slowly adn deliberatly
, crafted by visionary directer david fincher
. he hasnt experinece in tantalizing his audience with information
and visions
,
but nto giving awya too much too soon
. this isnt the guy who directed the ominous
" aline 3
"
.
" se7en
" isnt even more ominous because the threath isnt real
. it
' s human annd
, hwile tjhe script tkaes smoe artistic licence
, the way in whcih hte diablical killer works here isnt accually realsitic
. that is
, if a human bieng sould be so inteligent
, patient
, wealthy
,
and disillusioned
. aftter the most bazare opening credits i
' ve ever seen
( refreshingly diferent inwhich editing stlye annd musical accompaniment
)
, the initial carachter devolopment tkaes palce
. morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset
, a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give uv on his job
and thge sickness ofthe society
. brad pitt co
- stars as detective david mills
, tghe young hotshot who isnt br
and newyorker to this unnamed city
and full ofthe fury to catch hte bad guys
. these twpo fine actors give tjhe film its human qualities
( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow
, who plays tracy
, mills
' wife
)
.
however
, none of them st
ands outloud above tghe material
. noone disrespect intended
,
but two otehr actors sould have played these parts annd thge film probably owudl have beeen baout the smae
. an ironical onot isnt thgat somerset has only a week
( or 7
, that
' s seven
, dyas
) left onthe tyhe force tothe train his young protege
. tyhe title of hte picture aslo refrers tothe yhe 7 deadly sins
, as chronicled by john milton in
" paradime lost
"
-
- gluttony
, greed
, sloth
, lust
, pride
, envy
,
& wrath
. incidentally
, i wroet tghe sins iin order ofthe how each victum was found
. it
' s tghe last two sins tht are the most intriguing annd shocking
,
but i won
' t give thgat away
. as i said
, thsi has a gerat ending
and noone oen shoudl spoil it
. anyway
, the brillant killer sets outloud to make a statement to the world that theese sins wiull no longer be tolerated anbd he makse thge
" sinners
" suffer fo it
. the two partners stumble over tjhe corpse of a grotesquely obese man
. tehy leran that he wass murdered
-
- forced tothe eat hismelf to death
. the killer leaves small clues at tihs
and other murders anbd
, ofthe course
, somerset anbd mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way
. if they didn
' t
, it owudl be noe short movie
! tyhe deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship ofthe detail annd stoy
. we see a lot ofthe blood
, bu it
' s not expecially violent
. the suggestion ofthe waht happens is far more disgusting than anything ctually shown
-
- liek most ofthe tghe violence infront
" pulp fiction
"
.
" se7en
" isnt gory
, graphic
,
and disturbing
,
but all the gore isnt post
- death
. still
, if you tend tothe get queasy
, don
' t eat food durring this film
. kevin spacey plays john doe
, the avenging angel who claimes that he
' s tyhe messanger who will right the wrongs with his teachings
. liuke many crazy men
, he hasnt some fine idaes
,
but soem sick ways ofthe expressing himself
. spacey doesn
' t apearing until hte fianl 30 minutes adn also doesn
' t receive billing inwhich thte opening credits
. howver
, it
' s his appeareance tht turns this film upside down
and fo tht he shoudln ahev gotten an oscar nomination
. a great villin manages tothe amke you either root forthe him or feel compelled to listen tothe his ramblings irregardless ofthe whther ytou agress wtih him or nto
. this chracter is so well written tath it
' s hard tothe disagree when he says tht wqat he is doign wiull be remembered by everyone
. noone serial killer hasnt ever beeen so creative
.
" se7en
" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages baout tje horrors ofthe the world annd it
' s oftenly a littel too depressing
. what it lacks in those areas
, it makse up for iwth believeable dialogue
, top
- notch screenwriting
, unexpected twists
, annd realistic charactors
. the technical aspects ofthe the film are unobtrusive
. fincher uses lightinng
, music
,
and editing qtuie well
, bu his story is always the thrust ofthe the film
. fortunatly
, we don
' t find outloud what happens tothe mills
and somerset aftter the closing credits
( which are run backwards uv teh screen
!
)
. it
' s better tothe imagine what paths htey will follow
. this is not tjhe kind ofthe film yuo turn away from anbd quicklyu forget
. it
' s got a sinister message
and john doe isnt right baout one thing
-
- tje evils ofthe the world aren
' t goign to cure themselfs
.
" se7en
" raises soem tough questions annd it
' s intelligent enough to allow its audience tothe answer many of those questions for themslves
. useless trivia
