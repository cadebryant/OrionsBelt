there
' s some movies i enjoy even
though i konw i propably shouldn
' t adn have a difficult time trying to expalin why i doed
.
" lucky numbers
" is a perfect example ofthe tihs because it
' s such a blatent rip
- off of
" fargo
"
and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel adn yot it somehow still works for me
. i konw i
' m in thte minority here
but let me explain
. the film tkaes place in harrisburg
, pa in 1988 durring an unseasonably warm winter
. john travolta plays tghe local big
- shot tv weatherman who is idolized by thge townsfolk as if he were john travolta hismelf
and nto tje bumbling russ richards
. russ is married tothe crystal
( lisa kudrow
)
, a blonde bimbo if ever there was oney inaddition the history ofthe cinema
. she
' s a selfish
, nasty bitch full ofthe lust
and desire bu somehow she got tghe job ofthe teh lottery ball girl
- not exactlly thte most intellectually taxing job onthe yhe market
. crystal
' s cheating onthe russ with their colelctive boss dick
( ed o
' neil
)
, tyhe tv station manager
. she doesn
' t seem tothe genuinely liuke either of them
,
but it
' s all she cin dont in this noe
- horse twon
. much liek
" fargo
,
" this movei tells the stry ofthe a man who
' s goign borke
and hasnt to pul off a huge scam tothe get rich quick
. he enlists the halp ofthe his english firend gig
( tim roth
)
, the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery
. allong yhe way a subplot involving a two
- bit thug named
, accurately
,
" dale tyhe thug
"
( michael rappaport
) gets mixted up in the proccess
. htere
' s aslo a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once tghe deal goes down
. i
' m nto goign to elaborate much furhter onthe tyhe plot
and stry baceause it continues tothe unwind adn take twists adn turns you
' re not expecting
. htis is a farce
, whlch is basically a straightforward
, adult
- oriented comedy bu doesn
' t go as far as a clasic balck comedy should
. where as
" fargo
" was sometimes shocking
and disturbing hwile being funny
,
" lucky numbers
" is jsut funny because you can
' t tkae theese charachters inwhich theese outrageous situations seriously
. it
' s all a big cartoon basicly
,
but it
' s funny
and i can respect that
. travolta is great in his role
and even
though he
' s nto a really likable charcter
, he
' s trying to be a nice guy despite tje fact he
' s a creep
. he
' s like a ganster iwth morals who genuinely fiels sory for teh guys he hasnt to kill
. crystal is jsut tje opposite
, she
' s constantly arguing adn useing whatever brain cells she hasnt left to look out forthe herself
. kudrow is perfect in this role since she
' s spended 8 eyars onthe tv as the dim
- witted phoebe on
" firends
.
" here isnt charcter isnt basicaly a very evil incarnation ofthe phoebe
. i have tothe admit i ws honestly surprised
and pleased by how thge plot unraveled anbd tje methods eahc of the main charactors use tothe try tothe get thier share ofthe the moeny
. like
" jackie brown
,
"
( an elmore leonard adaption
)
, tje sotry is baout a circle ofthe 10 charactors all affter the lottery money that hasnt been won illegally
. tghe screenplay does a fine job iin balancing the charactors anbd slowy revealing thier motivations adn hidden agendas while at the smae timne keep russ richards hte main focus
. moreso
and more characters are introdued annd sicne the film hasnt such an iconic
, cartoony atmosphere ytou cxan take onthe faith just what makse the minor charactors dont what tehy dont
. tghe endig itself isnt great
. it
' s surprizing
and funny annd makes ytou fiel good
. ytou relize this film hasnt packed inwhich about 10 different movies
' worth ofthe stoies into two huors
' time annd didn
' t fall apart
(
al
though many otehr critics might beg to differ
)
. i liked it
, annd i could see it agian
- isn
' t that waht makse a movie good
?
