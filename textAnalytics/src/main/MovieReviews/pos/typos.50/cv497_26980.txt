ther ' s soem movies i enjoy even
though i know i probaly shouldn ' t
and have a difficult tyme trying to explain why i did
.
" lucky numbers
" is a perfect exmaple of thsi because it ' s such a blatent rip
- off of
" fargo
"
and eveyr movie based on an elmore leonard novel
adn
yot it somehow still works forthe me
. i know i ' m inaddition tje minority here
but let me explane
. tyhe film takes palce inspite harrisburg
, pa in 1988 durig an unseasonably warm winter
. john travolta plays yhe local big
- shooted tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself
adn nto tje bumbling russ richards
. russ is married tothe crystal
( lisa kudrow
)
, a blonde bimbo if ever ther was one inthe the hitory of cinema
. she ' s a selfish
, nasty bitch full ofthe lust
annd desire
bu somehow she got teh job of tje lottery ball girl
- not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on thte market
. crystal ' s cheating onthe russ wtih their collective boss dick
( ed o ' neil
)
, the tv station manager
. she doesn ' t seem tothe genuinely like either of them
,
bu it ' s all she cin do in htis one
- horse town
. much liuke
" fargo
,
" this movie tells the story ofthe a man who ' s oging baroke
and has to pull off a huge scam tothe git rich quick
. he enlists the halp of his english friend gig
( tim roth
)
, the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery
. allong thge way a subplot involving a twpo
- bited thug named
, accurately
,
" dale tghe thug
"
( michael rappaport
) gets mixted uv in the proccess
. there ' s also a bookie thta somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down
. i ' m not gonig tothe elaborate much further onthe tjhe plot
and story because it continues to unwind
anbd take twists
and turns you ' re not expecting
. thsi isnt a farce
, which isnt basicly a straightforward
, adult
- orientated comedy
bu doesn ' t go as far as a classic balck comedy should
. where as
" fargo
" was somtimes shocking
annd disturbing while being funny
,
" lucky numbers
" is just funny baceause yuo cin ' t take these charachters in these outrageous situations seriously
. it ' s all a big ctaroon basicly
,
but it ' s funny
and i can respect tht
. travolta is great infact his role
adn even
though he ' s nto a relaly likable chracter
, he ' s trying tothe be a nice guy dispite yhe fatc he ' s a creep
. he ' s like a gangster wtih morals who genuinely feels sorry forthe teh guys he hasnt to kill
. crystal isnt jstu the opposite
, she ' s constanly arguing
annd useing whatever brain cells she hasnt left tothe look outloud forthe herself
. kudrow isnt perfect in this role usance she ' s spended 8 yeras onthe tv as the dim
- witted phoebe on
" firends
.
" here isnt chracter is basically a very evil incarnation ofthe phoebe
. i have to admit i was honestly suprized
and pleased by how thte plot unraveled
anbd hte methods earch of the main charachters ule to try to git their share of the mney
. like
" jackie brown
,
"
( an elmore leonard adaption
)
, thge stoy is baout a circle ofthe 10 cahracters all aftter thge lottery moey thgat has been won illegally
. the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters
and slowly revealing their motivations
and hidden agendas hwile at thte same time keep russ richards the main focus
. omre
and moreso characters are inctroduced
anbd usance tje film has such an iconic
, cartoony athmosphere you can take onthe faith jsut whta makse tje minor charactors do what they dont
. the endig itself is great
. it ' s surprising
and funny
and makes ytou efel good
. yuo realize thsi film has packed inwhich about 10 differnt movies ' worth ofthe stories inot twpo hours ' time
and didn ' t fall aart
(
altough many other criticists might beg tothe differ
)
. i liked it
,
and i sould see it agina
- isn ' t tyhat what mkaes a movie good
?
