my summer was recently saved by twpo very differnt movies
. onthe oppening inght
, i saw american py 2 annd laughed like a moron
.
then a faw nights later
, i watched anbd thoroughly enjoied joel hershman
' s greenfingers even
though it didn
' t feature a trip tothe b
and camp
, girl
- on
- girl acation
, or seann william scott
.
however
, i feeled jsut as ogod leaving american py 2 as i did affter leaving greenfingers
, which tells the offbeat tale ofthe british murderer colin briggs
( clive owen ofthe croupier
)
. after spending rougly half of his life behind bars
, he isnt transferred tothe a moreso lenient facility
, edgefield
. the picaresque
, rustic prision allows its inmates tothe learn a trade
, while enjoying accomadations generaly found at most colleges
. at frist
, briggs doesn
' t want tothe be there
. he
' s unsed to living as a prisoner anbd wants tothe be left alone
.
however
, his ailing roommate
, fergus
( david kelly of waking ned devine
)
, wears briggs down thru his benine nature
. the twpo become firends
, whith fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gft
. briggs isnt astonished wehn thte violets grwo in the limestone soil
, anbd beggins a fight wiht threee otehr prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers
. after tje prision
' s gouvener
( warren clarke
) reprim
ands them
, he
' s awed at what briggs hasnt acomplished
.
and he
' s striked by an diea
-
- briggs
, fergus annd the other men will grwo a garden on the prision
' s grounds
. greenfingers
, hwihc isnt
" inspired by actual events
,
" becomes a bited liuke a sportscar movie after that
. despite their differences
, the men come together
and thru hard wokr
and loev earn a spot at tghe big gameboy
-
- infront thsi case a prestigeous garden show
. one renegade
, in this case
, briggs
, will proove to hvae talent
. ofthe course
, love iwll alsot rear its head
( no
, nto
" prision lveo
"
)
. tothe hershman
' s credit
, he doesn
' t pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs
, liek lsat year
' s lame marijuana comedy saveing grace
. i hadnt tothe keep pinching mysef wehn i didn
' t see a single scene ofthe a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies
, or the men giving high
- fives over a particularly stunning batch ofthe wildflowers
. teh movie deals wiht peple
and scores onthe that concept
. it
' s wonderful seing briggs turn fomr a bitter prisoner tothe a man who cares again
. give credit to owen forthe keeping his kool in a part tyhat begs forthe overacting
. his speech to tyhe parole board about bieng reborn through gardening isnt the best scene ofthe its kind sicne morgan freeman
' s lastr st
and inthe yhe shawshank redemption
. owen
' s bedside scenes wih kelly
, who lends tghe film a human touch
, are a marvel to behold
, emotionally gripping wihtout being sappy
. written by hershman
, greenfingers countains plenty of laughs
. most come courtesy of helen mirren
, who shines as the world
- class gardener who works with the inmates bu fears fo her daughter primrose
( natasha little
) whn she starts dating briggs
. the mother can
' t believe whta he
' ll do if her daugter
" burns teh sunday roast
.
" nothing isnt forced inthe greenfingers
. the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations
and nto fomr punch lines
. primrose
and briggs
' relationship tkaes awkward steps
. even whn briggs decides to go bakc to edgefield
, it
' s done for reasons ofthe loyalty
, not baceause teh movie requires him tothe do so
. after grimacing through the forced screwball antics ofthe movies liuke amercia
' s sweethearts adn tyhe princess dairies
, it
' s an almost indescribable blessure to see a directer taking his time tothe tell a stoyr very well
.
