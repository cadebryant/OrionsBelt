hte gr
andfather ofthe italion horror thge late mario bava hasnt credits inwhich nearly 100 films
and tv movies produced infront italy betwen 1939
and his death inthe the easly 80
' s
. moreso practiced as a cinematographer than a director
, bava nonetheless sat in the director
' s chair fo beyond yhe door ii
, hte project whcih turned outloud to be his lsat full
- length feature film
. alongside teh appalling zombie schlock of hacks liuke lucio fulci
, beyond tghe doorjam ii is simpley a revelation
. in his day bava ws considered by most tothe be noone graet filmmaker
,
yet here he fashioned oen ofthe the finest italion horror movies ofthe tghe 1970
' s
.
( note tht the film hasnt no conection wtih the 1975 exorcist
- rip off behind the doorjam
,
but forthe smoe unexplained reason was given htis realted title fo release infact the usa
and austrailia
.
) htis stor focuses onthe dora
, a womens set apon by a malevolent spirit tath channels itself thru her young son marco
. yhe film opens whith dora
, her son adn second husb
and bruno retruning to a house by the sae thast was tjhe scene ofthe her first husb
and
' s suicide
and her subsequent trama 7 eyars earlier
. they hope tothe put the past behind them
, bu as small accidents strat tothe befall dora
- usually while bruno isnt awya onthe business
- she starts to suspect thta marco
( played with uncanny abillity by 8 year ood david colin jr
.
) isnt somehow involved inthe the stange goings onthe
. to reveal any moreso ofthe the story woudl be unfair
. suffice tothe say that tihs artfully pased studdy ofthe a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot
, loads ofthe atomsphere anbd solid acting
,
though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by yhe dubbing into english
. bava coachs a suprizingly good performence from thte usualy wooden daria nicolodi
, wife of famed itallian horror directer dario argento
. her character isnt invested wiht sufficent depth to allow the audience rela empathy wih dora
' s troubled soul
. the music by itallian ansamble libra isnt aslo effective
, mixing odd
- sounding 70
' s rock with clasic gothic piano sequences
.
and there isnt at least one moent
- brilliantly engineered by bava
- taht isnt garanteed to lift you ten foots outloud of your chair
.
yet forthe itallian horror
, tghe bloodletting here isnt surprizingly minimal
. lamberto bava annd francesco barbieri
' s script isnt more concerned whith deeper
, psychological terrors
, with themes of guilt
and suffering
, withthe the notion thgat waht we sow iwll shall
- somewhere
, somehow
- eventually reap
. scholars of the genre tkae note
: beyond tghe doorjam ii is stylish
, chilling
, adn essential
.
