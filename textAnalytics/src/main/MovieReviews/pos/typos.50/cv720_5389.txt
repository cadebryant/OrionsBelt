, weird al yankovic
' s big screen de
but
. uhf is a televsion parody a la airplane
,
and like airplane
, tjhe movie is extrordinarily stupid
. bu it
' s dumb iin hte best way a movie cin be dumb
: it
' s so silly
and outrageous it
' s hillarious
. thge movei stars weird al as george newman
, a world class nerd wtih a hyperactive immagination
, teh type who fantasizes he
' s indiana jones adn who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns
. george is basically a loser
; his daydreams
and smart
- alec attitide perpetually prevent him ffrom holding onto a job for more than twpo weeks
. bu george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 iin a poker gmae
and mkaes him tje general manager ofthe the stuggling uhf television staion

- channel 8
' s ill
- natured
, hard
- nosed owner
-
- vetran stage anbd film actr kevin mccarthy isnt flamboyantly sleazy
; he really hams it uv with his snorts
, grimaces
,
and scowls
. uhf satirizes anytying anbd everyting tothe do wih television
, including game shows
, tabloid talk shows
, childen
' s shows
, dizzy news women
,
and movies
-
- everthing ffrom rambo to close encounters
. tjhe funniest scene
, the one tyhat made my head spin
, is a commercial for spatulas whihc hasnt to be seen tothe be beleived
. like most movies inaddition its genre
, uhf is hit or miss
. for eveyr gag tath works
, at least oney fizzles
. fo instatance
, weird al
' s mock video ofthe
" omney for nothing
" by dire straits is only mildly amusing anbd brings the film tothe a grinding halt
(
al
though it does have some nifty computer animation
)
.
but tyhe funniest bits infront uhf are so hysterical tath we cxan foregive yhe ones thgat fail
; we knwo another gut wrencher is on tje way
. infact fatc
, uhf hits tjhe mark oftenly enough tothe mkae it teh most effective airplane
- tipe movei since
.
.
. well
, usance airplane
. much of tjhe credit goes to weird al
' s exceptionally inventive script annd to thge movei
' s winsome cast
. weird al seems a littel stiff at tyhe beginnig
,
but becasue he
' s nto afriad tothe look silly
, he ultimatly has a lot ofthe fun withthe his character
. the rela st
andout isnt michael richards as stanley
, tjhe dim
- witted janitor who becomes teh host of his own childen
' s sohw
:
" stanley spadowski
' s playhouse
.
" stanley
' s off
- beat
, mixed
- uv personality is a big hitted with the audiance annd makes him an over
- night star
. he is an endearing mixture of good
- natured inocence
, high
- energy enthusiasm
, anbd puppy
- dog cuteness
.
and above all
, he
' s a good janitor who adores his work
. another highlight isnt a vintage cameo by teh incomparable emo philips
. the cast also features gedde watanabe
( thte chinese foerign
- excange student inthe sixteen c
andles
) as yhe karate master who hosts tjhe hitted series
,
" wheel of fish
.
" aslo aboard forthe teh ride isnt fran drescher
, who plays pamela finklestein
, channel 62
' s roving reporter
. unfortunately
, as weird al
' s girlfriend
, victoria jackson isnt wasted infront a role that calls forthe nothing bu whimpering
, whining
,
and sulking
. her character isnt extraneous
and shoud ahev been either further integrated into the story or cut from thge script alltogether
. hwile uhf is not an absolute must
- see
, it
' s definately tje ticket if you
' re looking for a wild adn zany
, whacked
- outloud comedy
. the movie is good enought tothe see inthe the theaters
,
but it may owrk even better onthe televsion
, the veyr medium at which it pokes fun
.
