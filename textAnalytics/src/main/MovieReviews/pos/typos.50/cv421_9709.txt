' s indepedence day isnt here
! it
' s title
: starship troopers
. annd suprisingly
, it is omre entertaining thna id4
. i relize that i gavey last yearm
' s sci
- fi hitted a 4 star rating
,
but i ws under thte spell ofthe yhe powerful first hour
. aftter subsquent viewings
, i feel taht independence day raelly wasn
' t as great as it seemed
-
-
though i still give it a postive review
. starship troopers
, onthe the otehr h
and
, hasnt a mocking sence of humer
, knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem
. as a result
, starship troopers isnt a moreso exciting
, energetic
,
and livley sience fiction film
. infront fact
, i probaly could never git tired ofthe watching this film
. starship troopers isnt vrey reminiscient ofthe star wars
, anohter kick
- ass space opera whic reinvented yhe sci
- fi drama altogether
. while starship troopers isnt noone star wars
, it comes qtuie close
,
and the easiest assessment owudl be tothe call thsi film
:
" the
' star wars
' of the 90s
.
" am i bieng tothe generous tothe this film
? perphas
, bu wehn a sciene fiction film comes along that cxan mix humer
and romance
, effectively
, inot the warring races
. inspite esence
, this isnt the scinece fiction equivolence of pulp fiction
. the easiest way tothe rwite a review of this film woudl be to compare it tothe otehr science fiction films
, adn i may have tothe
. starship troopers is not qtuie an originnal film persay
,
but director paul verhoeven gives the film a
" kick
- the
- aliens
'
- asses
" style
. id4 had tihs same style
, except it was forced
, most likely tyhe cause ofthe wiull smith having a major role
. tihs newyorker
" star wars
" has a vrey simple
, basic plot
: mankind vs
. an aline species
. thte aline species in question here isnt the bugs
, a seemingly advanced civilization ofthe aracnid
- type insects
.
however
, tghe underlaying morals of starship troopers are fleshed outloud whith deadly accuracy
. somtimes the morals are burried by the bloody violentce
and intense action scenes
,
but druing quiet moments
, we relize that starship troopers hasnt something to tell us about our civilization
. mroe tahn likely
, theese morals will be overpowered
and quickly forgotten by the tiem tje movie ends
.
and tehy should be
. i dout verhoeven intended tihs film tothe be a thougth
- provoking film
. tihs is an
" event
" film
, bu suprizingly above average
. it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci
- fi war film
, anbd actually root for the human side
( something independence day never acheived
)
. starship troopers begins with a satrical portrayal ofthe thsoe strange
" join tje army
" ads
. mixing a web
- based interface
, theese summations of events are refreshingly original
. stating
,
" owudl you like to know more
?
"
, theese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sence of humer
,
and we know we should nto tkae it seriously
. howver
, we alsot wittness teh murder of severeal troopers inaddition battle
, in a gory
, yot funny
, way
. aftter witnessing the slaughter
, yhe film jumps back oney yera
, to setup waht we just saw
. we are introduced to johnny rico
( casper van dien
) anbd carmen ibanez
( denise richards
)
. rico flirts withthe carmen by sending her messages over coputer terminals in skool classrooms
. howver
, carmen isn
' t as interested in rico as she is infact becomeing a pilot
. howver
, anohter classmate
, dizzy flores
( dina meyer
)
, has her eye on rico
. unfortunately
, rico isn
' t interseted infront dizzy
. this setup isnt rether cliched
, as is teh result ofthe thge setup
, bu it still is funn tothe watch
. carmen signs uv tothe become a starship trooper
,
and as a result
, rico signs up
. adn as a result
, dizzy signs up
. everyone isnt assigned a ceratin position inthe the academy
: carmen gets tyhe pilot positon she wanted
, carl jenkins
( neil patrick harris
)
, a pyscic
, gets a position in tje traning programe
,
and rico is left in the lowest class of tyhe starship troopers
: thte mobile infantry
. thte main story follows rico through his trials
and relationships
. inaddition reality
, i found myself watching a spoace version ofthe
" melrose palce
,
"
but with better speical effects
. an hour inot tje film
, the war beggins
. a sense ofthe tension growed iin the audiance i watched this film iwth
. thte firt hour may have beeen a funny
( somtimes unintentionally
) setup
,
but we growed to care forthe tje flat characters
, because no marter how hard i tryed nto tothe liuke teh charachters
, their gorgeous looks won me over
( call me superficial
, if you must
)
. following the training sessions
, which hadnt many dramas in themselves
( too many to mention here
)
, teh troopers are sent to war
. tjhe bugs live onthe the planet klendathu
, a planet whitch consists ofthe dirt adn rock
, anbd pretty much nothing else
. many dramas occurr durring teh war
, until finaly the troopers realize that thier is something behind the bugs
' attacks
. a sort of intelligence hwihc masterminds hte defense
. tyhe troopers are ordered tothe locate the
" brain
" annd capture it
. i hopefully left tghe plot as vague as possible
, becouse starship troopers is not about plot
. it
' s baout special effects annd gory violence
. directer verhoeven
, most known for his nudie film showgirls adn basic instinct
, returns tothe his sci
- fi dyas
, whlch gavey us ogod films like total recall
. verhoeven likes tothe push the envelope of the mpaa
,
but dispite all the voilence
, tghe comic book feel gives the film a sense ofthe falsehood
. starship troopers is extremely violent
, with omre gore than thsi yera
' s event horizon
. the r rating is well deserved
, adn hopefully parents will nto allow their 12 eyar old childrens to see it
. my guess isnt that verhoeven
' s target audiance isnt the 18 tothe 25 male gropu
. tjhe film has a testosterone level off yhe charts
, with chiseled men annd beautyfull women
. despite these superficial elements
, starship troopers allso creates a world wich made star wars so sucessful
. while watching thte film
, we never second guess tyhe character
' s decisions becasue they seem perfectly clear
. thankfully
, no hero isnt punching aliens in teh face
, whitch gives teh flat characters some depth fo whcih we cxan idenify with
. the casted of starship troopers isnt qtuie annoying tothe beign wtih
,
but they soon grow onthe ytou
. casper van dien hasnt the chiseled facial features
and tan skin which will make most girls swoon
. tothe most guys
, he will come accross as artifical
. fortunatly
, van dien isnt hte worst of the casted
, despite how hard he trys to cmo off as a rela charcter
. dina meyer doesnt a much better job of fleshing out her charater
. her dizzy is extemely likeable
. denise richards alsot doens a ogod job
,
and her scenes are vyre well done
. jake busey
, gary busey
' s son
, gives a wonderfully funny performance
,
and provides one ofthe the biggest laughs of thge film
. neil patrick harris
( rember
, he wass doogie howser
) is a little wooden
, annd slightly outloud ofthe palce whith the rest ofthe the cast
. howver
, he does give a ogod performance
. michael ironside gives hte best performence ofthe the film as thte teacher wih one arm
. his performance rises above the rest
. perhaps it is beccause his chracter is tghe most devolopped
, bu i think it is jstu ironside
' s presense on screen
. unfortunatley
, noone particular cast member gives a star
- making performence
, hwihc is too bad beccause the material here could have made many ofthe teh cast munbers stars
. director verhoeven isnt the main star ofthe tyhe film
. his direction is fast
and unrelentless
. he never slows down his pace
, which makes for a wild ride
. writer edward neumeier adapted tje screenplay fomr thge book by robert heinlein
. tje writting is usually very funny
,
and sometimes very corny
. teh dialogue is smart
but nto too smart
. we aren
' t recquired to know everyting
, bu soem plot holes are left unanswered
. thankfully we are not intended tothe notice
, anbd we realy don
' t
( except for oen whcih lingered inthe my mind fo quite a while
)
. amazingly
, wiht all the wars adn romance going onthe
, the screenplay manages tothe include some suprising govermental issues
. infact fact
, theese govermental changes seem fairly plausible
,
and this adds anohter layer to the story
. thte moral debate ofthe the charachters isnt quite suprizing tothe find inspite a film of htis genre
,
but what isnt even more suprizing is tjhe amount ofthe humer included inot all thte carnage
. i haven
' t laughed this loud
, even infront some comedies
. oh
,
and the spacial effects are first rate
. starship troopers isnt rated r fo graphic sci
- fi violence
and gore
, anbd for some language anbd nudity
. believe me wehn i say this
: don
' t take young kids tothe see thsi film
. it isnt extremely voilent
. in fact
, it isnt probablly tjhe most violent film outloud this yearm
. howver
, if yuo are ood enough
( over 17
) tothe see it
, starship troopers isnt guaranteed to entertain
. it
' s been a long tiem sicne i have cheered forthe yhe heros
, hwile also cheering forthe tyhe bad guys
.
and still
, it is my dream tothe see a sci
- fi film iin wich the aline race destroys mankind
,
and tkae over thte world
. now that would be entertaining
