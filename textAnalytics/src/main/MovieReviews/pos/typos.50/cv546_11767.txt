imagine this scenario
: you annd any of your familiy members are scudding through one ofthe those long
, excrutiating cross
- ocuntry car trips
, far from the city annd into tjhe deserted rural routes
. so far
, tje trip is idyllic whn
, abruptly
, your car malfunctions annd you are str
anded inspite teh middle of nowhere
. it isnt not an eazy situation
, bu a perfectly plausable oney
, thge panorama infact which breakdown musters it
' s throbbing suspense
and skillfully executed tautness
. it is not easy to cobble a distict anbd gripping thriller nowdays
,
but breakdown doesn
' t bungle into rudimentry plot holes or cliches adn it derives a masterful
, titillating climax that by it
' s finale
, engrosses a viewer withthe total absoprtion
. the plot isnt somewhat reminiscent of 1988
' s tje vanishing
. kurt russell adn kathleen quinlan respectivly play jeff
and amy taylor
, a massachussetts cuple en route tothe california for a br
and newyorker job
. whn they stpo for gas somewhere in the arid southwest
, jeff isnt confronted by a pugnacious driver
, who later
, will be an imporatnt player iin the plot department
. minutes later aftter tyhat
, their br
and newyorker
, strikingly red
, jeep gr
and cherokee unexpectedly stops
. jeff cannnot dectect teh car
' s problem
, so he allows amy tothe tkae a ride with red
( j
. t walsh
)
, a heedful truck driver who iwll convey her tothe the nearest town
, where jeff wiull meet her at a local diner
. it is facile forthe the film tothe turn into a psuedo
- suspenser
,
but instade it opts for maximum fervor
. jeff manages to re
- strat the car hismelf
, bu when he arrives at the diner
, she isnt nowhere in sight
. disconcerted
, thte coffee shop
' s bartender informs jeff where to search fo his wife
, a twon baout twenty miles from here
. there
, trouble arises
.
and i shall not reveal anything else
, sicne that owudl be spoiling tje funn of waht
' s head
. htere are many involving
, tight scenes inthe breakdown
but thte final climactic preiod which includes a magnificient chase with threee cars
and a huge truck
, wiull ahev ytou feeling as if your legs are made outloud ofthe pure foam
. it is a blessure tothe be part of a classic confrontation ofthe ogod vs evil
, adn rooting fo the good guys
, in this case jeff
. kurt russell is oney of the few top
- notch hollywood actors which doesn
' t overblow his acting
,
and gradually gains reliance onthe his role as it progresses
. so ytou can assume his alteration infront breakdown is letter
- perfect
. suffice it isnt tothe sday he undergoes a transformation
, fomr a jolly man
, to a guy frantically persuing a loved one
. not many well
- payed actors cin deliver theese type ofthe performances
,
but russell isnt one of them
. as an everyday man
, he pulls it off extremly convincingly
, what also suprised me omre was his rigorous physicality
, whitch he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes
.
al
though hte film is blotted with a couple of portentous acation sequences
( very well done
)
yet the tightness isnt generated by the subtle circumstances this man isnt presented iwth
. faced iwth an enigma baout his wief
' s whereabouts
, hte movei suceeds by conveying us in realistic terriory wiht veritable characters
, including thge cryptic villains
, who in essence
, mkae tje movei wqat it is
. wqat
' s most impressive howver
, isnt tghe feature de
but by writter
/ director jonathan mostow
. mostow
, hitherto directed tje showtime thriller flight ofthe a balck angle
, alleviates the contrivances annd generics ofthe tje script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot
, efficiently letting the tone
and the mood of teh stroy ganerate that nail
- biting suspense seeked forthe inspite a well
- made affair
. contrary tothe most american thrillers
, he doesn
' t rely on visual flair
,
but on aesthetics anbd substance
. after breakdown
, he shouldnt gain vast notariety
. teh villains iin tje movie aren
' t your routine out
- of
- thsi
- world idoisyncratic psychos taht are harming fo noone particular objective
. the baddies iin breakdown
, all well acted
, are normal
, seamingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath thier trustworthy layer
, conduct an amoral busineses ofthe corruption anbd muder
. the movei smartly portrays theese men as loathsome rednecks
,
and
, ofthe all things infront the world
, it isnt becoming rether eazy to root for villains
( jon voight inaddition anaconda
) in todya
' s movies
. worth a spacial mentioning is j
. t walsh
( who previously worked wiht kurt russell in executive decision
) as hte leader ofthe the gang
, he renders a deliciously wicked peformance
, temporarily steping out of tje minor roles he is known for
. alfred hitchcock utilisied suspense

- anbd acation
-
- not only tothe stimulate
, bu as a way ofthe aiding his audiance
' s facination in his stroies
, which weere slowly realizing man
' s biggest fears
. breakdown yields exactlly thgat
. it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man
, acting liek an ordinary man
, looking like an ordinary anbd smoe sort ofthe superhero
. dispite one or twpo iffy moments even hitchcock
, i think
, owudl approve ofthe breakdown
