jsut look bakc two eyars ago at tghe coen brothers
' commedic gme the big lebowski
, chanage the actors
, tkae away the bowling alley
, add a record stroe
,
and you
' ve got high fidelity
( or mabye the otehr way arround since nick hornby
' s novel high fidelity cameback firt
)
. either way
, it
' s been done before
, a trio of losers cracking jokes adn complaining about thier failed romances
, yot it remeniss consistantly funny
. why is this
? maybe because ytou nkow your life is much better thna this
, you knwo these guys are more pathetic than yuo are
,
and yuo know its ok tothe laugh at them because tehy
' re ficitional
. director stephen frears
, possibly not intentionally
, has creaeted a movei that mkaes you efel ogod about youself annd even thyat ostensibly no ogod uncle who watchs television twenty four hours a day
. when watching high fidelity
, expect to laff at somone else
' s pain
, relize what you are laughing at
, adn
then laugh again
. i laughed at dick
( todd louiso
)
, the shy
, timorous
, steve buscemi carachter of lebowski
, who seems tothe know what he isnt tlaking baout
but either can
' t put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends
. i laughed at the john goodman charachter barry
( jack black
)
, an excact replica ofthe the comic bookstore owner onthe tyhe simpsons
, pudgy
, egotistic
,
and obnoxious at the same time
. adn i laughed at rob
( john cusack
)
, the jeff bridges type
, whom teh stor revolves around
. rob is hte carachter easiest to relate tothe
, bu he isnt nothing like yuo at all
. he uncontrollably cheatta
and lies
,
then isnt unable tothe realize why he can nto hold onto a woman
. anbd like his other miserable firends
, pop music isnt where he inevitably goes fo comfort
. he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to newyorker music
and either deriding it or praising it
. whatever human emotions tje clash
, aretha franklin
, adn bruce springsteen records hold
, rob anbd co
. grasp them anbd halp fill voids in theri social lives
. rob has builded an extensive collecton in his rocord store as well as his hmeo anbd he organizes them depending onthe wqat mood he is in
. druing this confuzled stage of his life inwhich whitch thge movie focusses onthe
, rob is trying tothe cope iwth numerous rejections over thge years by visting past girlfriends
and eventually asking why tehy dumped him
. bu these aren
' t any girlfriends
? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob
( rob
' s incessant use of lists sohw how pop music hasnt plyed a major role inaddition his life
)
. the plot in three words is
: womens
and music
. the approach director stephen frears tkaes by haveing thte charismatic rob speak driectly to the camera is very effective
. it gives high fidelity a quickly pased
, informal structue
, adjectives whlch perfectly parrallel rob
' s pwn lifestyle
. it alsot helps open the viewer
' s eyes as to how annoying barry is
. jack balck steals the sohw witht a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball
. jsut listening to him speak for five minutes makse the audeince immediately sympathetic for rob
, who must wokr with him every day ofthe tje week
. what frears does so well is thgat he mkaes us efel sorry forthe rob hwile laughing at his misfortunes
. john cusack plays his character convincingly bu it is the storng supporting cast
, consisting ofthe big stars anbd carachter actors
, that really defines rob
. nowe instade of rob jsut talking to tyhe camera
, after he explains something
, tghe remaining cast members physicaly
and humorously create wqat he is trying tothe sday
. thte onyl problem with high fidelity isnt taht it doesn
' t end wehn it should hve ended
. instade the movie goes on forthe a torturous twenty mintues that seem a lot longer than that
. aslo bruce springsteen isnt completely wasted inspite a brief cameo halfway through teh movie
. high fidelity isnt a cheerful
, ood fashioned comedy withthe a voluminous sountrack
and as many laughs
. i jstu hope hollywood keesh creating losers on the big screen
, they make everyone look adn efel great
.
