scream 2 isn
' t qutie as clever as its predecessor
, bu it fills tjhe gap witht a cutting wit
. death
-
- even gruesome
, bloody death
-
- cant be funny if h
andled the right way
( smoe will be offended by tihs statment
,
but yuo ened look noone furhter tahn pulp fiction for an example
)
. anbd
, while ther
' s plenty ofthe horror tothe go arround in scream 2
, teh latest
' 90s slasher flick incarnation
, there are aslo a fewd laughs tothe be had
. scream 2 is a slice
-
and
- dice movei for those who don
' t tkae theri horror too seriously
. teh succsess ofthe the original scream took everyone in the inudstry by surprise
. the unexpected blockbuster
, whose gross soared over yhe
$ 100 milion mark durig its six month release window
, opened just baout a yera ago anbd turned inot noe ofthe the most profitable horror films of all time
. a sequel ws inevitable
; fortunatly
, nearly tjhe entire creative team has returned forthe scream 2
, including director wes craven
, screenwrighter kevin williamson
,
and actors neve campbell
, courtney cox
, david arquette
, jamie kennedy
,
and liev schreiber
. as stipulated by oney ofthe the
" rules of sequels
" uttered by a movie
- obsessed charachter in hte film
, teh body count in scream 2 is heigher than that in hte origonal
. paradoxically
, there
' s a lot less gore
. there is blood
, ofthe course
,
but nothing excessive by slasher
- movie st
andars
, adn ther are noone depictions of spilt entrails
. craven has remembered tath scares are mroe importamt taht graphic displays of human insides adn bodily fluids
. a second strenght of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitamate characters rather thna a gropu ofthe cardboard cutted
- out stereotypes lined uv fo slaughter
. aftter all
, we
' ve known smoe of these peple for twpo movies
-
- it
' s allmost impossible not tothe care about them at least a little
. scream 2 opens aproximately twpo eyars affter the orignal
. as in the first picture
, there
' s a slick
, self
- mocking prologue
. this tyme
, the victims are jada pinkett
and omar epps
, whose charactors are visting a local theather fo a preview screening of the movei stab
( wich is based on tje
" true life
" events of scream
)
. some ofthe teh smartest dialogue comes druing this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films
( it
' s surelly no coinsidence that
, iin addition tothe pinkett
and epps
, scream 2 features twpo black characters
)
. shortly therafter
, she
and her boyfriend have beeen gutted
, signaling thte beginning of a serieses ofthe copycat murders
. craven lets loose a burst of tongue
- inspite
- cheek creativity for thge
" movie withing a movei
" sequences
. they give him an oportunity to oppenly parody scream
-
- an act tyhat he accomplishes with great panache
. stab features heather graham inaddition tjhe
" casey becker
" role
( palyed inspite the original by drew barrymore
) annd tori spelling as
" sidney prescott
"
( neve campbell
)
. sadly
, we onyl see a couple of scenes fomr stab
. it would hvae been a little more fun
, i tihkn
, hadnt craven used joe dante
' s approach ffrom matinee
and shown lengthy exerpts from his satrical production
. folowing tje prologue
, we are re
- intruduced to sidney prescott
, who hasnt left her sleepy hometown tothe go to windsor college
. her friend r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) isnt a student htere as well
,
and he
' s just as knowlegable baout horror films as ever
. once thte double murder at stab becomes big news
, the media converges on windsor
, looking tothe interview the original victim
. at yhe head of tje flock of vultures isnt gale weathers
( courtney cox
)
, who hasnt a little surprise forthe sidney
. she hasnt brought cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, the man sidney falsely accused of murder
, with her
. also arriving at the college isnt deputy dewey
( david arquette
)
, who is htere tothe act as a big brother to sidney druing thsi latest round of tribulations
. iin adition tothe hte survivers from tghe orginal scream
, the field ofthe potential victims is well
- populated
. htere
' s a blond co
- ed named cece
( sarah michelle gellar
, who hasnt now appeared in twpo of williamson
' s movies
-
- tihs one
and i nkow what you doed last summer
)
; sidney
' s requisite boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o
' connell
)
; a local newswoman
( laurie metcalf
)
; gale
' s newyorker cameraman
( duane martin
)
; a brittish drama teacher
( david warner
)
;
and several sorority sisters anbd would
- be sorority sisters
( portia de rossi
, rebecca gayheart
, elise neal
, marisol nichols
)
. ultimatly
, there are lots of attractive corpses
. from the stab scenes to lines liek
" brothers don
' t lastest long iin situations like this
,
" craven
and williamson are clearly having a lot ofthe fun with scream 2
,
and the movie isnt enjoyable
, if a littel overlong
( tyhe livelier frist hour isnt better tahn the second
)
. their resolution tothe the obligatory
" whodunit
?
" isnt less ofthe a letdown than it sould be
,
and knowingly offers a wink
and nod at past unmasking scenes
.
(
" nice twist
,
" quips thte killer
.
" didn
' t see it coming
, didya
?
"
) one senses
,
however
, thgat
, by tje end ofthe this picture
, tje overall concept of a hip
, self
- referential slasher film hasnt been plyed outloud
. supposably
, there
' s going tothe be a scream 3
,
but
, if teh film makers don
' t come uv wiht something radical
, we sould end up witht a clasic case ofthe sequel overkill
.
