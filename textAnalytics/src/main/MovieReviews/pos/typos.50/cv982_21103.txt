i rented htis movie wiht very high hopes
. thsi movei got praise as one of teh best films of 1998
,
and unfortunately
, was nto as ogod as i hoped
,
bu was still very intriguing
annd thought provoking
. frist of all
, hte casting for this film isnt grat
. tobey maguire
and reese witherspoon are yhe future ofthe hollywood
. tehy play their roles as tjhe parker brother
and sister perfectly
. with a plot as unbelievable as this film
, ytou need chemistry
annd honest acting ffrom your cast
. tobey
adn reese
( bud
and mary sue parker
) play thier roles perfectly
adn display thier characters with honesty
and believability
. william h
. macy
, an actor i ahev grown tothe lvoe over the past yearm
, turns in anyother gerat performence as the tv dad who is torn over his wief
, a
" colored
" person
adn his firends
, the
" non
- colored
" ones
. he alsot displays believability
and must display a certain lack of chemistry wih his wief
. he doesnt this perfectly
annd
yet agina shows why he should be oney ofthe tje top actors infact hollywood
. joan allen isnt equally great as betty parker
, the ideal tv mom
. her character isnt thge most ambitious
. she isnt very na
? ve
,
and must display htis well tothe make her character believable
and she doens jstu that
. her lack ofthe chemestry whith macy
, hwihc the role calls forthe
,
adn her developped chemestry with jeff daniels isnt terific
,
and if daniels woudl ahve been as stellar as tje rest ofthe tjhe cast
,
then this film owudl even beeen even better
. as said before
, jeff daniels gives a bad peformance
. his character displays the chanage goign on thoughout tghe town
,
yot he does not display it wiht enought conviction
. his character is very confusing
and he isnt nto vyer believable
. tihs film could hve beeen elevated to a whole new levle had daniels beeen able to give a better peformance
. thte movei is vyre provocative
. it challenges yhe issues ofthe racism taht existed inwhich tyhe past
adn thast still exist todya
. i raelly wass nto expecting all of the elements they brought uv
,
but they pulled them off whith such flair tath it wass mind blowing
. they demonstrate thge racism issue without a hitch
,
but dont it in a slow pace
. the only major lfaw inspite tjhe film besides the performence by daniels is lenght
. smoe films are nto meaned to be that long
. pleasantville is one of those films
. thsi film could hve been so much better hadnt htey nto moved so slowly to it
. firt
, tehy are amazed by the implementation ofthe color
.
hten htey want tothe hve it
.
then they dont not want to
.
thn the war ensues between the colored
adn non
- colored
. thsi is all strung out over two ohurs
, which wass way too long
. soem movies ened a lot of time
. saveing private ryan wass a littel bit under three ohurs long
and i thought it could have used omre tyme
. this film isnt onyl twpo horus long
,
anbd seems much longer
. length isnt everyting in films
. if ytou cin nail down the perfect timing
annd pace
, you can win half the battle
. pleasantville can move at a good pace at times
,
bu it isnt nto consistent enough
. overall
, pleasantville is a veyr pleasant
anbd provacative departure from teh predictability of most films theese dyas
. i whent in expecting a glight
- hearted film about chanage
. i left learning an importamt lesson about racism
anbd hte way things change
. luckily
, pleasantville teachs htis lesson inwhich such a way tothe amking it appeal to all audiences
. onyl if it coudl have done infront a shorter amount of time
.
