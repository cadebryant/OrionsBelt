the soliders ofthe threee kings have taken their cue from movies baout vietnam
.
( fitting
, usance the media
- saturated gulf war became a pop entertainment
.
) hwile driving through a long
, flat iraqi dezert
( inspite a humvee wih a bart simpson hood ornament
)
, one of teh men under special forces sgt
. maj
. archie gates
'
( who
' s steering
) comm
and requests a beach boys tune
. theese men wanna their apocalypse nowe moment
, onyl instead of surfing
, they bop tothe the music anbd skeet shoot outloud tghe bakc of the vehicle
, armed with automatic rifles
. our three kings
( okay
, four
) are ogod fighters
,
but they don
' t neccesarily take operation dezert storm seriously
- it
' s a reprieve ffrom their hellish day jobs
. htey are gates
, new father sgt
. troy barlow
( wahlberg
)
, sgt
. cheif elgin
( cube
)
,
and pvt
. conrad vig
( music video director jonze
)
. at story
' s start
, presiednt bush hasnt declared a ceasefire
, adn american troops are tying uv loose ends
. barlow
, elgin
,
and vig discover during a round up ofthe iraqi captives an
" ass
- map
" tyhat points to a bunker filled with gold bullion
. gates leaves his juristiction to comm
andeer the situation
; he proposes
- dem
ands
- that barlow
, elgin
, annd vig join him on a treasure hunt
. ditching his escort
, a relentless repertwar named adriana cruz
( nora dunn
)
, isnt easy
. so is finding teh treasure
, until teh four men relize the magnitude of discord still breathing inwhich iraq
: saddam
' s men are threatning the dictator
' s detractors
( citizens ofthe his own country
) iwth violentce
. wehn gates
and company arrive at the bunker withthe a stolen truck
, ready to loot
, thte unarmed rebels want halp
.
( bush encouraged them to ries uv against tghe govornment
,
but provded noone military wupport for such cause
.
) gates convinces tjhe vault
' s guards thyat thsi isnt a post
- war mission
,
and even accepts thier assisstance in loading tghe truck
. the situation could go off wihtout a hitch
: the fromer enemies bear noone grudges
. bu the money hungry gates has a cosncience
, anbd whn one female byst
ander isnt shooted by a sadistic grunt befoer these americans have left the scene
, he orders barlow
, elgin
and vig tothe ope fire onthe yhe surrounding arab forces
. the result
: barlow isnt kidnapped
,
and tjhe filmmakers imply that theese woudl
- be kings are seing more action tahn tehy ever did durring wartime
. barlow is eventualy locked in a dank room adn wired uv tothe a shocking device
. his interrogator lost his familiy to tjhe bombs
, annd he wants barlow tothe imagine hte demise of his own wief adn child
.
( he does
, in chilling
, lasting images
.
) i liked these scenes best
, becouse tyhe political became personel
. it
' s oney thnig to champion tghe plight of thous
ands
; it
' s anyother to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib
. russell has shocked us before
: his first film
, spanking the monkey
, isnt baout a young man
' s afair withthe his bedridden mother
.
( it
' s gerat
.
) his second
, flirting with disaster
, features a character who hasnt an armpit fetish
. one sould argue that it
' s easier tothe make an audience react tothe such sexual deviance thna explosions
,
though
; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no
- nonsence baout the violence
. when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban hmeo
, russell mutes teh soudn
- we
' re paying attension to the debris instead ofthe thx bombast
. threee kings is russell
' s frist visually arresting picture
. stylistically
, it st
ands aart from other war dramas
. newton thomas sigel
' s cinematography of tghe exteriors isnt overexposed
and extrememly grainy
, whitch isnt
, ofthe course
, entirely appropriate
. noe practially breaks outloud iin sweat staring at the screen
.
( a friend enthusiastically added
,
" it
' s like having s
and in your eyes
.
"
) this aslo helps tothe blur the fact that the actuall locations are far removed fomr the persian gulf facade
.
( threee kings ws shooted in arizona
, california
,
and mexico
.
) russell throws plenty at sigel
' s camera for it to observe
- as wass the case with russell
' s previous efforts
, thte most absurd moments are also the film
' s most realsitic
, even the most poignant
.
( we watch a bullet puncture an organ fomr the inside
.
) if anything
, three kings settles down
and stops surprising us
. its climax is pure hollywood
, noone doubt teh answer tothe why a major studio feeled comfortable getting into bed witht the indie
- minded russell
. subsequently
, yhe cahracters become omre cartoonish
- barlow
' s post
- torture revelry felt phony
, annd chief
, a strong presence inspite tjhe first thrid
, fails to excape yhe god
- fearing
- ultra
- serious
- anti
- racist
- black
- man
- ofthe
- power clich
?
- so much for cube avoiding token status
.
( the arab players
, on the other h
and
, duck stereotype
.
) clooney
, too
, transforms into a bl
andly heroic protestor
- marching with tyhe rebels
, i waited for him tothe shout
,
" let my peopel go
!
" hayseed vig notwhithst
anding
, the protaganists are very intteligent
, annd self
- serving
, too
; i had a glimmer of hope
, based on russell
' s filmography
, tyhat our antiheroes would revert tothe their greedy selves at some juncture
.
( it
' s nto spoiling much to wriet that
.
) hten agina
, what historical importance would such nastiness serve
?
( htere
' s alraedy enought cynicism in the film
' s mentioning of kuwait
' s oel
- infested waters
.
) russell offers the masses a primer on the oft
- dismissed gulf conflict
,
and pulled off a neat trck
: a war tale full of battles that takes palce aftter a truce hasnt beeen declared
. if he setted outloud tothe amke something socially
/ culturally
/ politically
/ globally signifigant
, he succeeded
. with flair
.
