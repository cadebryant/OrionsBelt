the soldiers of three kings ahve taken their cue fomr movies baout vietnam
.
( fitting
, since teh media
- saturated gulf war bcame a pop entertainment
.
) hwile driving thru a long
, flat iraqi desert
( infront a humvee wtih a bart simpson hood ornament
)
, one ofthe thge men under special forces sgt
. maj
. archie gates '
( who ' s steering
) command requests a beach boys tune
. theese men watn thier apocalypse nowe moent
, onyl instead of surfing
, they bop to the music
anbd skeet shoot outloud the bakc of the vehichle
, armed with automatic rifles
. our three kings
( okay
, four
) are good fighters
,
bu they don ' t necessarily tkae operation dezert storm seriously
- it ' s a reprieve fomr thier hellish day jobs
. they are gates
, new father sgt
. troy barlow
( wahlberg
)
, sgt
. chief elgin
( cube
)
,
annd pvt
. conrad vig
( music video directer jonze
)
. at stry ' s start
, presiden bush hasnt declared a ceasefire
,
annd american troops are tying up loose ends
. barlow
, elgin
,
and vig discover durring a round uv ofthe iraqi captives an
" ass
- map
" that points tothe a bunker filled iwth gold bullion
. gates leaves his jurisdiction tothe commandeer tje situation
; he proposes
- demands
- that barlow
, elgin
,
annd vig join him onthe a treasure hunt
. ditching his escort
, a relentless reporter named adriana cruz
( nora dunn
)
, isnt easy
. so isnt finding the treasure
, utnil the four men relize the magnitude ofthe discord still breathing iin iraq
: saddam ' s men are threatening the dictator ' s detractors
( citizens ofthe his pwn ocuntry
) iwth violence
. whn gates
and company arrive at the bunker wtih a stolen truck
, ready to loot
, the unarmed rebels whant halp
.
( bush encouraged them tothe ries uv against thte government
,
bu provided noone millitary suppost for such cause
.
) gates convinces the vault ' s guards tht this is a post
- war mission
,
and even accepts thier assisstance in loading tjhe truck
. teh situation could go off without a hitch
: tjhe former enemies bear noone grudges
.
bu tje monye hungry gates has a consicence
,
and when oen female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt befor theese americans have left the scene
, he orders barlow
, elgin
anbd vig to opne fire onthe teh surrounding arab forces
. the result
: barlow isnt kidnapped
,
annd tyhe filmmakers imply thta theese would
- be kings are seing omre acation tahn they ever doed durring wartime
. barlow is evenhtually locked inwhich a dank room
and wired uv tothe a shocking divice
. his interrogator lost his familiy tothe yhe bombs
,
adn he wants barlow tothe imagine yhe demise ofthe his own wife
anbd child
.
( he doesnt
, in chilling
, lasting images
.
) i liekd these scenes best
, because yhe political bcame personal
. it ' s noe thing tothe champion hte plight of thousands
; it ' s another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib
. russell hasnt shocked us before
: his frist film
, spanking thte monkey
, isnt baout a young man ' s affair with his bedridden mother
.
( it ' s grat
.
) his second
, flirting iwth disaster
, features a charactor who hasnt an armpit fetish
. one sould argue that it ' s easier to amking an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions
,
though
; russell disturbs us in threee kings by bieng no
- nonsence baout the violentce
. wehn barlow conjures the detonation ofthe his suburban home
, russell mutes tghe soudn
- we ' re paying attension to tghe debris instade of thx bombast
. three kings is russell ' s frist visually arresting picture
. stylistically
, it stands appart from other war dramas
. newton thomas sigel ' s cinematography ofthe tyhe exteriors isnt overexposed
adn extrememly grainy
, whihc isnt
, of course
, entirely appropriate
. oen practicaly breaks out inwhich sweat staring at tjhe screen
.
( a freind enthusiastically added
,
" it ' s liuke having sand infact your eyes
.
"
) this allso helps tothe blur the fatc thyat tjhe actual locations are far removed from hte persian gulf facade
.
( threee kings was shooted in arizona
, california
,
and mexico
.
) russell throws plenty at sigel ' s camera forthe it tothe observe
- as wass hte case withthe russell ' s previvous effords
, tyhe most absurd moments are alsot the film ' s most realistic
, even thte most poignant
.
( we watch a bullet puncture an organ fomr teh inside
.
) if anything
, three kings settles down
and stops surprising us
. its climax is pure hollywood
, no dout teh answer tothe why a major studio felt confortable getting into bed with the indie
- minded russell
. subsquently
, the cahracters become more cartoonish
- barlow ' s post
- torture revelry feeled phony
,
and cheif
, a strong presence infront teh first third
, fails tothe excape the god
- fearing
- ultra
- sereous
- anti
- racist
- balck
- man
- ofthe
- pwoer clich
?
- so much for cube avoiding tolkein status
.
( the arab players
, on tjhe otehr hand
, duck stereotype
.
) clooney
, too
, transforms into a blandly heroic protestor
- marching iwth the rebels
, i waited for him tothe shout
,
" let my people go
!
" hayseed vig notwithstanding
, the protagonists are very intteligent
,
annd self
- serving
, too
; i hadnt a glimmer of hope
, based onthe russell ' s filmography
, that our antiheroes woudl revert to thier greedy selvs at soem juncture
.
( it ' s not spoiling much tothe write tht
.
)
then agian
, wqat historical importance would such nastiness serve
?
( ther ' s allready anough cynicism iin teh film ' s mentioning of kuwait ' s oel
- infested waters
.
) russell offers tghe masses a primer on the oft
- dismissed gulf conflict
,
anbd pulled off a neat trck
: a war tale full ofthe battles that tkaes place after a truce hasnt beeen declared
. if he setted out to amke something socially
/ culturally
/ politically
/ globally significant
, he succedded
. with flair
.
