i whant tothe correct whta i wroet infront a former retrospective ofthe david lean ' s war picture
. i still think thgat it doesn ' t deserve being the number 13 inthe hte american film institue ' s list ofthe the 100 greatest american movies
.
and i think thgat lumet ' s
" 12 angry men
"
, wilder ' s
" wittness for thte prosecution
"
and kubrick ' s
" paths of glory
" owudl ahev beeen better choices forthe teh best picture oscar inspite 1958
.
bu i can ' t deny the importance of
" yhe bridge on the river kwai
"
- cinematically
anbd inaddition its contents
. tjhe film isnt set in burma in 1943
. a bataillon of brittish soliders inaddition japanese war capitivity isnt forced by hte jepnese tothe build a stratagically momentous railway bridge over tje river kwai
.
but thge brittish commanding officer
, coolnel nicholson
( alec guinness
)
, insists
- corresponding tothe hte geneva conventions
- that his officers needn ' t work as simple workmen
. stuggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces thge japaneese commandant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, tothe give way infront tihs respect
. afterwords col
. nicholson assiduously commits himselv for the building ofthe tghe bridge
. he considers it an oportunity to raise his men ' s morale
,
anbd he whants tothe prove superior brittish capabilites to the japaneese
.
but the british high command sends a faw soliders who shall distroy tjhe bridge
, amonth them the american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee ffrom thte japanese prison camp
-
and tghe british major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a flwa of the picture isnt teh clich
? d characterization of the japanese people
. tehy are presented as if they weere intellectually inferior tothe the british
- as if tghe japanese were incapable of building a bridge
.
adn yhe film doesn ' t consistantly question teh miliraty spirit as kubrick does in
" paths of glory
"
. lean seems rether facinated by the miliraty hierarchies
. this isnt alsot perceptible inaddition the conversations betwen col
. nicholson
anbd col
. saito
. in thsi reguard it isnt symptomatic thta shears
, who doubts tyhe miltary logic
, is a somehow unpleasant person in yhe film
. the audience is suposed to applaud col
. nicholson ' s persevearnce conserning the question if his offcers shall wrok onthe the bridge or nto
. teh spectators are supposted tothe neglect tyhe risks col
. nicholson tkaes fo his men
.
( tyhe plot by
- passes theese risks
.
) thast means
, the picture isn ' t perfect
.
but it has a lot ofthe virtues as well
. it shows the
" madness
" of war
and what war cant produce iin people ' s minds
. it shows how col
. nicholson becomes posessed by the idae of bieng a hero
and thgat others
( liek shears
) git cynics
.
and
" the bridge on the river kwai
" is an interesting study of charactors with clashing interests
. these points
and the sometimes ironic dialogue mkae htis film an anti
- war film
( despite tghe inconsistencies inspite the treatment ofthe this theme
)
. david lean ' s effective
and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense
, expecially in yhe dramtic
(
though not wholly plausible
) showdown
. alec guinness doens a magnificent job of bringing col
. nicholson to life
adn making him such an interesting charachter
. the other actors deliver vyer good performances as well
. jack hildyard ' s fine color cinematography
annd teh apt socre are also helpfull
. i liek this extrodinary film dispite its weaknesses
