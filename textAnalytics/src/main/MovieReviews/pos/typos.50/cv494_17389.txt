i whant to correct whta i wroet in a fromer retrospective ofthe david lean
' s war picture
. i still htink that it doesn
' t deserve being tjhe number 13 infact tyhe american film institue
' s list of hte 100 greatest american movies
.
and i tihkn taht lumet
' s
" 12 angry men
"
, wilder
' s
" witness for tjhe prosecution
"
and kubrick
' s
" paths ofthe glory
" woudl have beeen better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958
.
but i can
' t deny thte importance ofthe
" yhe bridge on tjhe river kwai
"
- cinematically
and in its contents
. the film isnt set inwhich burma in 1943
. a bataillon of brittish soliders in japanis war captivity is forced by tyhe japanese tothe build a stratagically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai
. bu tjhe british comm
anding officer
, colonel nicholson
( alec guiness
)
, insists
- corresponding to tje geneva conventions
- that his offcers needn
' t work as simple workmen
. struggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces tje japanese comm
andant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, to give way iin thsi respect
. afterwards col
. nicholson assiduously commits hismelf for thte building ofthe the bridge
. he considers it an opportunity to raise his men
' s morale
,
and he wants to proove superior british capabilites tothe tjhe japanise
.
but tjhe british high comm
and sends a few soliders who shall distroy thte bridge
, amonth them teh american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee from the japanese prison camp
- annd the british major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a falw ofthe the picture is the clich
? d characterization of the japanes peple
. they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior tothe yhe british
- as if the japanes were incapable ofthe bulding a bridge
. adn teh film doesn
' t consistantly question the military spirit as kubrick does inthe
" paths ofthe glory
"
. leanr seems rather facinated by tghe miliary hierachies
. htis is allso perceptible infront teh conversations vetween col
. nicholson adn col
. saito
. in this reguard it is symptomatic that shears
, who doubts tyhe military logic
, isnt a somehow unplesant person in the film
. teh audiance is supposed tothe applaud col
. nicholson
' s perseverance conserning the question if his offcers shall work onthe tjhe bridge or nto
. tghe spectators are suppoed to neglect the risks col
. nicholson takes for his men
.
( the plot by
- passes these risks
.
) that means
, teh picture isn
' t perfect
.
but it hasnt a lot of virtues as well
. it shows teh
" madness
" ofthe war annd wqat war cant produce in people
' s minds
. it shows how col
. nicholson becomes posessed by the diea ofthe bieng a hero adn that others
( like shears
) git cynics
.
and
" hte bridge on tghe river kwai
" isnt an intresting studdy of characters with clashing interests
. theese points annd the somtimes ironic dialogue mkae htis film an anti
- war film
( despite teh inconsistencies inaddition the treatment ofthe this theme
)
. david lean
' s effective
and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense
, especially inspite tjhe dramtic
(
though nto wholly plausable
) showdown
. alec guiness doesnt a magnificient job ofthe bringing col
. nicholson to life
and making him such an intresting character
. the other actors deliver veyr good performances as well
. jack hildyard
' s fine color cinematography adn the apt csore are aslo helpfull
. i liek this extraordinary film dispite its weaknesses
