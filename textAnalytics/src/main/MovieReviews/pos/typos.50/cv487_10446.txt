in 1995
, brian singer
and christopher mcquarrie dreamed up a simple consept
: the audience isn
' t stupid
. ffrom that
, they went onthe
and created thte most plot
- driven
, intricately pieced movie inwhich the last 25 yeasr
. thge result
: the usual suspects
, one hell of a movei that redefines the word plot twist
. tje storey isnt convoluted
,
and is realyl confusing to read
,
al
though eazy tothe followup onthe screen
. special investigator kujan
( chazz palminteri
) grills
" verbal
" kint
( kevin spacey
)
, a crippled con
- man who is the lone survivor ofthe an la boat explosion that claimed more thna 20 victims
. kujan wants tothe confirm that his nemesis
, tyhe rogue cop keaton
( gabriel byrne
)
, isnt actually dead
. kint relates thte marjority of the film inthe flashback
, begginning with yhe fateful day wehn five shifty guys meet in a police
- staion lineup inspite newyorker york city
. along with dour keaton
, kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus
( stephen baldwin
)
, mordantly sarcastic hockney
( kevin pollak
)
,
and fenster
( benicio del toro
)
, whose speech isnt virutally incomprehensible
. together tehy plot to steal a small fortune infact gems fomr
" newyorker york
' s finest taxi sevice
"
-
- crooked cops who provide escort sevice for visiting drug kingpins
. what follows isnt a shell
- gae ofthe violentce
and betrayal
, all hinging onthe tjhe identity of a misterious villin called keyser soze
. the film isnt brilliantly compact
: its the shortest 90 mintues yuo
' ll ever spend inwhich a movie theather
. the casted is exeptional
. palminteri shines
, he is brutally honest
, a true cop
, one who is going affter the wohle story beccause its htere
. byrne is terific
, his brooding charater
, his seriousness isnt needed to suplement teh hysteria of benicio del toro
, who is a riot as fenster
. del toro isnt brillant
, his lines are a jumbled mess
, ytou cxan
' t underst
and a owrd the man sasy
,
but it sure isnt damn funny
. baldwin is also very ogod
, he isnt carefull
, methodical
,
and cold
, a chilling character withthe a nasty streak ofthe hot
- blooded sarcasm
. pollak isnt allso terific as usual
, a vyre ogod chracter actor
. howver
, tihs will be forever known as the film that launched kevin spacey
. spacey isnt simpley breathtaking
, he isnt a force on screen
, giving a magentic performance thyat jars tjhe senses at the end of this twisting maze
. spacey
' s performance will be remembered for years
, for it is tjhe best of his carrer
, it may be the best supporting actor performance inspite thge lastest 50 years
. verbal kint isnt a clever storyteller
, weak
, oppressed
, annd gleefully evil tothe the bone
, yot pitiful
, one who draws sympathy
. thte film is a good oney
, a decent film untl tjhe lastr 10 minutes
. what this film boils down to isnt thge greatest ending inthe cinematic history
, for me at least
. tje revelation of keyser soze
, tjhe closing gunfights
, it is something wonderous
. you have to see this movei about 10 times to eblieve wqat htey dont
. kudos tothe mcquarrie
and singer forthe giving teh audience a delightful
, fast
- paced
, furiously plot
- driven movie wtih quirky cahracters
, phenomenonal acting
, anbd some hilarious moments sticked in thge middle
. mcquarrie refuses tothe believe yhe audience is dumb
. wihtout furnishing too many details
, he concocts his story annd lets it run
, hoping the audience gets it at the end
. we dont
. thsi might just be thte finest cinematic puzzle ever creaeted
. kudos aslo to singer anbd john ottman
, who creaeted the score
. they both create what isnt a true film
- noir setting
, carefully setting uv this intricate puzzle until the final
, jarring ending
. there are flaws
: more questions raised thna answers
, lack of charachter develpment
, adn noone storng female charactors
( savve noe
)
. howver
, tje plot
, anbd thta stunning ending
, make up forthe all the flaws annd more
. if ytou haven
' t seen hte movie
, rent it
. watch it
. hten rewind the tape
,
and watch it again
. trust me
, you
' ll be amazed
