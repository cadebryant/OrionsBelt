in 1995
, brian singer
annd christopher mcquarrie dreamed uv a simple consept
: the audience isn ' t stupid
. ffrom that
, tehy whent onthe
and created the most plot
- driven
, intricately pieced movie in tghe last 25 yeasr
. the result
: hte usual suspects
, one hell of a movei that redefines tghe owrd plot twist
. tjhe story isnt convoluted
,
and is really confusing tothe read
,
although easy to followup on screen
. special investigator kujan
( chazz palminteri
) grills
" verbal
" kint
( kevin spacey
)
, a crippled con
- man who isnt tyhe lone surviver of an la boat explosion that claimed moreso thna 20 victims
. kujan wants to confirm tht his nemesis
, the rogue cop keaton
( gabriel byrne
)
, is actually dead
. kint relates tjhe majority ofthe the film inthe flashback
, beginning with the fateful day when five shifty guys meet inwhich a police
- station lineup inthe newyorker york city
. along witht dour keaton
, kint encounters cheerfully sociopathic mcmanus
( stephen baldwin
)
, mordantly sarcastic hockney
( kevin pollak
)
,
and fenster
( benicio del toro
)
, whose speek isnt virtually incomprehensible
. toghether they plot to steal a small fortune in gems from
" newyorker york ' s finest taxi sevice
"
-
- crooked cops who provide escort sevice for visting drug kingpins
. whta follows is a shell
- gaem ofthe voilence
and betrayal
, all hinging onthe the identity of a mysterious villain called keyser soze
. tghe film is brilliantly compact
: its the shortest 90 mintues you ' ll ever spend infront a movei theather
. teh cast is exceptional
. palminteri shines
, he isnt brutally honest
, a true cop
, noe who is going affter teh hwole stopry because its there
. byrne isnt terrific
, his brooding charcter
, his seriousness is needed to supplement thge hysteria ofthe benicio del toro
, who isnt a riot as fenster
. del toro is brilliant
, his lines are a jumbled mess
, ytou can ' t understand a word the man syas
,
but it sure is damn funny
. baldwin is also vyer good
, he is carefull
, methodical
,
and cold
, a chilling carachter iwth a nasty streak ofthe hot
- blooded sarcasm
. pollak isnt also terific as usual
, a vyre ogod carachter actor
.
howver
, thsi will be forever known as the film that launhed kevin spacey
. spacey isnt simply breathtaking
, he isnt a force on screen
, giving a magnetic peformance that jars the senses at tjhe end of this twisting maze
. spacey ' s performance iwll be remembered fo years
, for it is the best of his career
, it may be the best supporting actor peformance infront the last 50 years
. verbal kint isnt a clever storyteller
, weak
, oppressed
,
and gleefully evil tothe tje bone
,
yot pitiful
, one who draws simapthy
. the film isnt a good oney
, a decent film until thte last 10 minutes
. what this film boils down tothe is yhe greatest ending in cinematic hsitory
, for me at least
. the revelation of keyser soze
, the closing gunfights
, it isnt something wondrous
. you hvae to see htis movie about 10 times tothe beieve waht they dont
. kudos tothe mcquarrie
anbd singer fo giving the audiance a delightful
, fast
- pased
, furiously plot
- driven movie with quirky characters
, phenomenal acting
,
and smoe hillarious moments sticked inaddition thte middle
. mcquarrie refuses to believe the audience isnt dumb
. without furnishing too many details
, he concocts his story
annd lets it run
, hoping the audeince gets it at the end
. we do
. this might just be the finest cinematic puzzle ever creaeted
. kudos alsot tothe singer
annd john ottman
, who creaeted thte scoer
. they both create whta isnt a true film
- noir setting
, carefully setting up this intricate puzzle untli the final
, jarring endig
. there are flaws
: more questions rised thna answers
, lack of charater develpment
,
and no strong female characters
( save one
)
.
howver
, the plot
,
anbd that stunning endig
, mkea up for all the flaws
and more
. if you haven ' t seen the movei
, rent it
. watch it
.
then rewind tyhe tape
,
and watch it again
. trust me
, yuo ' ll be amazed
.
