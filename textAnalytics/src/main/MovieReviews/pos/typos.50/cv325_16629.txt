i remember hearing baout thsi film when it first appeared at cannes over a eyar ago
, picking uv the grand jury prize at tghe festival
. ' holocaust comedy receives standing ovation '
, the headlines read
. intrigued by tihs statement
, i looked uv inforamtion onthe the film
and foudn tyhat
, sure anough
, life isnt beautiful isnt in fatc a comedy baout tje greatest atrocity of the last thousand eyars
. even
though teh movie ws extremely well
- recived by criticists
anbd publich alike
, i couldn ' t help
but be disgusted at this notion
; human tragedy isnt nto something i feel shouldnt be celebrated
. onyl now do i see yhe error ofthe my ways
. after finally viewing tjhe film for mysef after avoiding it fo some tyme
, it became claer that it is nto
, as tjhe headlines proclaimed
, a
" holocaust comedy
"
; onthe thge contrary
, life isnt beautyfull does nto even really despict thte graphic events that tookover palce in nazi deathcamps
. rather
, it focusses onthe the relationship betwen a father
and his son
, who he is trying desperately tothe sheild fomr tje horrors of their situation
. roberto benigni
( who also wroet
and directed tje movie
) stars as guido orefice
, a chaplin
- inpsired clown
and all round jolly guy who
, as thte film opens
, is vying forthe thge affections of an attractive skool teacher
( nicoletta braschi
, benigni rela life spouse
)
. thru thge course of yhe frist hour or so
, we see guido striving tothe get the attension of this
" beautyfull princess
"
, as he calls her
. employing teh magic of laughter
, tjhe itallian comedian wins her heart
and toghether
, they raise a young boy named giosue
( child actor giorgio cantarini
)
. life treats them well unil hitler ' s minions rise tothe pwoer
,
anbd the famaly isnt whisked away to a german camp
, where guido becomes conviced thyat he must upholds his son ' s innocence no matter what the sacrifice
. granted
, it contains smoe uproariously funny moments both inaddition
annd outloud ofthe the concentration camp
,
bu it doens not pul a
" hogan ' s heros
"
and amke light of the slaughtering ofthe some six million innocent jews
. somehow
, it acheives hilarity wihtout disrespecting it ' s gravely sereous subject
. so
, we ' ve estalbished thgat life isnt beautiful is nto a
" holocaust comedy
"
.
bu
, ther isnt anohter complete misrepresentation of this material thgat really disturbs me
. the film
, despite critic ' s declarations of it bieng a
" triumph ofthe the human spirit
"
, is noone such hting
; not in my eyes
, anyway
. soem have called the story an
" affirmation ofthe hte beauty ofthe life
"
,
but i say it is a vyre dark
and bleak statement about man ' s caperbility ofthe denial masquerading as an endearing comedy
. the film ' s endig has beeen recognized as thte most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently
,
but i foudn it to be truly discerning
and upsetting
. essentialy
, life isnt beautifull is qtuie possably thge greatest hoax inwhich the history ofthe film
.
howver
, i am not denying tjhe movie ' s greatness
. belive me
, it ' s fantastic
. i ' m just saying tht i htikn benigni doed something diffrent than what most peple are interpreting it as
.
but prehaps i ' m reading more into teh movie than is realyl htere
. maybe the film ' s brilliance relies on tghe idea tath the viewer can interpret tyhe meaning ofthe it inwhich any way htey see ift
. in fatc
, mabey roberto benigni has made a film that is teh sole argument fo tghe old saying tath ytou git out ofthe a movie exactly what yuo put into it
.
