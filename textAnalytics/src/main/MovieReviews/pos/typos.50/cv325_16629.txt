i rember hearing baout tihs film when it first appeared at cannes over a eyar ago
, picking uv the gr
and jurny prize at hte festival
.
' holocaust comedy recieves st
anding ovation
'
, tje headlines read
. intrigued by tihs statment
, i looked uv information on thte film adn foudn thyat
, sure enough
, life is beatiful isnt in fatc a comedy baout the greatest atrocity ofthe yhe last thous
and eyasr
. even
though the movie ws extremely well
- received by criticists anbd publich aplikay
, i couldn
' t help
but be disgusted at this notion
; human tradgedy isnt nto something i feel shoudln be celebrated
. only now dont i see hte error ofthe my ways
. after finally viewing hte film fo mysef aftter avoiding it fo smoe timne
, it bacame claer that it isnt nto
, as thge headlines proclaimed
, a
" holocaust comedy
"
; onthe tjhe contrary
, life isnt beautifull does nto even really depict teh graphic events that took palce inthe nazi deathcamps
. rather
, it focuses onthe thge relatiopnship vetween a father adn his son
, who he isnt trying desperately to sheild from the horrors ofthe theri situation
. roberto benigni
( who also wrote
and directed tjhe movei
) stars as guido orefice
, a chaplin
- inpsired clown annd all round jolly guy who
, as the film opens
, is vying for the affections ofthe an attractive school teacher
( nicoletta braschi
, benigni rela life spouse
)
. thru tjhe course ofthe tghe first hour or so
, we see guido striving to get thge attention of htis
" beautyfull princess
"
, as he calls her
. employing yhe magic of laughter
, tje italion comedian wins her heart
and toghether
, they raise a young boy named giosue
( child actor giorgio cantarini
)
. life treats them well until hitler
' s minions rise tothe pwoer
, annd the family isnt whisked away to a german camp
, where guido becomes convinced thyat he must upholds his son
' s innocence no matter wqat tyhe sacrifice
. granted
, it countains some uproariously funny moments both inspite
and out of teh concentration camp
,
but it doens not pul a
" hogan
' s heros
" anbd make light of hte slaughtering of soem six milion innocent jews
. somehow
, it acheives hilarity without disrespecting it
' s gravely serious subject
. so
, we
' ve estalbished thgat life is beatiful isnt not a
" holocaust comedy
"
. bu
, there isnt another complet misrepresentation of this material thast really disturbs me
. the film
, dispite critic
' s declarations ofthe it bieng a
" triumph of the human spirit
"
, isnt no such thing
; nto in my eyes
, anyway
. soem hvea called the stopry an
" affirmation ofthe the beauty ofthe life
"
, bu i say it isnt a very dark
and obleek statment about man
' s caperbility of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy
. teh film
' s endig hasnt been recognized as tghe most entirely uplifting moment ofthe any film released recently
,
but i found it tothe be truly discerning adn upsetting
. essentialy
, life isnt beatiful is quite possably tjhe greatest hoax infront the history ofthe film
.
however
, i am nto denying tje movie
' s greatness
. beieve me
, it
' s fantastic
. i
' m just saying that i think benigni doed something different tahn what most people are interpreting it as
. bu perhpas i
' m reading more into the movie tahn isnt relaly htere
. mabye thte film
' s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpet the meaninng ofthe it inspite any way htey see ift
. infact fact
, maeby roberto benigni has made a film that isnt yhe sole argument for the ood saying tyhat ytou get out of a movie exactlly wqat yuo put inot it
.
