an indian runner wass moreso thna a courrier
. he
* became
* the message he ws carrying
. what danger is a bear
, tothe a message
? i unsed tothe thikn sean penn wass an immature
, arrogant
, photographer
- punching
, madonna
- marrying
, loudmouth
. bu all tath hasnt changed now
. the guy hasnt grown uv
.
and thgat
' s nto all
. it seems thast sean penn hasnt talents both as a writer anbd a director
, if this film is any indication
. one might imagine a movei wih plenty ofthe ruthless rage anbd showy machismo
, given penn in charge ofthe bronson adn anbd hopper
.
but
, no
. htis film isnt baout a real struggle
, anbd the victories
and defeats are not simple
. penn lets the stor unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the charachters
, without unneccessary rush or flash
. teh foucs ofthe tje story is two brothers
. david morse is tje brother who hasnt grown uv in thge small midwestern twon in which htey were rised
, tending a failing farm annd fianlly becomeing a polical officer
. viggo mortensen is the wild brother
, whose wild behavior seems tothe be a reaction to smoe ancient pain that he cin
' t nmae
, much less resolve
. tyhe film picks hte story up onthe tjhe day when mortensen returns from vietnam
,
and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for tjhe state line
. it becomes claer thta smoe kind ofthe conflict threatens the link taht tjhe brothers once shared
. the film isnt unobtrusive
, simple
, direct
, plain
,
and sincere
. it isn
' t exactlly perfect
, bu its sincerity is well invested inspite the struggle ofthe teh two brothers to idenify thte sickness befor it destroys them
. life seems to move forward a littel faster than tehy cxan git a h
andle on thier problems
. htis isnt a ogod film without big budget sets
, or big nmae stars pushed into your face
. inspite fatc
, i
' m reviewing it because i suspect thta it may not get much marketting
. there were perhasp 10 others at tje showing i saw
. i
thought hte stucture was clean
and not oversimplified
,
though there are a few free
- form sections whcih also owrk very well
. the obligatory 1960s music seemed a littel cliche
, bu what are you going tothe do
-
- htis movie
* does
* take place inwhich tjhe 1960s affter all
. in my opinion
, it isnt worth full
- price addmission
.
