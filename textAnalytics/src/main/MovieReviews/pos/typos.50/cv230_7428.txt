well
, i
' ll admit whn i first heard about this film
( whlch ws before dante
' s peak
) i could just smell what
' twister
' had started
. so nowe it seems that we
' re in a full fledged return to the
' 70
' s diaster film era
. whith
' twister
'
,
' dante
' s peak
'
,
' volcanoe
' adn soon
' flud
' annd james cameron
' s extremly expensive
' titanic
' i
' ll say firt off i enjoyed
' volcanoe
' much more than i doed
' dantes peak
'
. part ofthe that isnt jsut bieng biased as i usally enjoy anything thta tommy lee jones appears infact
. i
' ve been reading a lot about the movei being
' cheezy
' or
' hokey
' adn really didn
' t see or think that once druing the entire film
. i get bored easily
and this film didn
' t bore me forthe a minute
. another thing
,
and boy am i bitching todya
!
, taht bothers me isnt whn criticists annd such go on baout
" well thats not really possible
.
" ytou know what
? i couldn
' t give a bloody damn if it
' s possibile or nto
, relaly i couldn
' t
. it
' s a freaking movie annd i don
' t wnat reality thrown infront my face
. i wnat to be able to see the impossible
, tje all might
" what if
" tothe many reviewers haev seen noe to many movies

. they are so amazing that i foudn it hard sometimes tothe believ they were indeed fx anbd la ws was not burning tothe teh ground
