what isnt freedom
? how doesnt noe determine who is free
? inwhich 1839
, thsoe questions were moreso difficult to answer thne tehy are nowe
.
yet
, yhe mistakes ofthe our forefathers must be examined in order tothe rectify curent situations
. that isnt
, infact esence
, what steven spielberg
' s gripping drama
" amistad
" isnt about
. through its various dramas
, spielberg presents a case baout a gropu of africans
, who
, after bieng siezed fomr theri home
, weere forced onto a ship
and sent to the untied states aboard
" la amistad
"
. on thier way there
, the slaves
, led by cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, rebelled
, killing off part of the crew
.
however
, thge ship ws still directed towards tyhe untied states
, where the africans weere broght to trial under muder
. inaddition hte cout
, various factions claim ownership of the slaves
, anbd therfore try tothe sieze them away
. tje untied states government
, led by president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
,
and secretery of state secratary forsyth
( david paymer
)
, try to ship tghe africans tothe spain
, where an 11 year ood isabella ii
( anna paquin
) wants them back
. the two spaniards who pwn
" la amistad
" want tghe slaves forthe themselfs
. teh american ship that foudn tje slaves alsot wants them
. infront the midst ofthe this are two abolitionists
( stellan skaarsgard anbd morgan freeman
)
, who watn the slaves tothe be free
. tehy enlist hte help ofthe lawyer matthew mcconaughey
, who trys tothe free them
. through various legal proceedings
, tyhe case appears before the supreme cout
, where it is argued by ex
- president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. the film itself isnt a visual wonder
. spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets hte film in a dark
, somber mood whn appropropiate
,
and a visual setting wehn appropriate as well
. at times
, the film is very slow
,
and vyre methodical
. howver
, spielberg is nto at his finest here
, because thge courtroom scenes ahev a tendancy tothe lag
. tyhe film isnt
, inaddition esence
, a courtroom drama
, one whose events are oversimplified
. the characterization is aslo weak
, displaying weaknesses iin bulding up cahracters such as the lawyer baldwin
( mcconaughey
)
, adn especially morgan freeman
' s abolitionist
. bu spielberg
' s finest work inwhich the film
, thge opening scene
, a scene ofthe cinque
' s family
, annd the brutal voyag ofthe teh slaves tothe amercia
, isnt alltogether stunning
. it is this emotional force that carries yhe film
. mcconaughey isnt superb as tjhe lawyer defending the africans
, hopkins is sensational as teh ood adams
, freeman is outst
anding when used
( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents
)
,
and the rest of the cast isnt stellar
. tghe movei
, howver
, belongs to hounsou
. his emotional intensity isnt brilliant
. spielberg manages tothe make even yhe slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou
,
and the film
' s extraordinary power isnt simply captivating
. tghe film isnt flawed
, for most of thge supporting characters are merely cardboard
.
but that doesn
' t matter
. the stoyr isnt a gripping one
, annd noe of extreme importance
. kudos to spielberg forthe finding it
, finding tyhe right men for the job
,
and letting hte audeince listen to the words ofthe cinque
. a good job all arund
.
