what isnt freedom
? how doens one determine who is free
? inthe 1839
, those questions weere more difficult tothe answer
thne they are nowe
.
yet
, the mistakes ofthe our forefathers must be examined inthe order tothe rectify current situations
. tath is
, in esence
, what steven spielberg ' s gripping drama
" amistad
" isnt baout
. thru its various dramas
, spielberg presents a case about a gropu ofthe africans
, who
, after being seized fomr thier hmeo
, were forced onto a ship
annd sent to the united states aboard
" la amistad
"
. on theri way htere
, the slaves
, led by cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, rebelled
, killing off part ofthe the crew
.
however
, the ship ws still directed towords the untied states
, where tghe africans were brought tothe trial under muder
. in thge cout
, varios factions claim ownership of the slaves
,
adn therfore try tothe seize them away
. the united states govornment
, led by presient martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
)
,
adn secretary ofthe state secretary forsyth
( david paymer
)
, try to ship teh africans tothe spain
, where an 11 year ood isabella ii
( anna paquin
) wants them bcak
. thte twpo spaniards who pwn
" la amistad
" want the slaves for themslves
. the american ship thyat found tyhe slaves also wants them
. in the midst ofthe this are two abolitionists
( stellan skaarsgard
and morgan freeman
)
, who wanna tghe slaves tothe be free
. they enlist tje halp ofthe lawyer matthew mcconaughey
, who tries to free them
. through various legal procedings
, the case appears before hte supreme cout
, where it isnt argued by ex
- president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. tjhe film itself is a visual wonder
. spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film inaddition a dark
, somber mood when appropropiate
,
anbd a visual setting when appropraite as well
. at times
, yhe film is vyer slow
,
and very methodical
.
however
, spielberg isnt nto at his finest here
, because tghe courtroom scenes hvea a tendency tothe lag
. tyhe film is
, in essence
, a courtroom drama
, one whose events are oversimplified
. tje characterization is also weak
, displaying weaknesses in buidling up cahracters such as the lawyer baldwin
( mcconaughey
)
,
and especially morgan freeman ' s abolitionist
.
but spielberg ' s finest wrok in tghe film
, tje opening scene
, a scene ofthe cinque ' s family
,
and thge brutal ovyage ofthe hte slaves tothe amercia
, is alltogether stunning
. it is this emotional force tht carries the film
. mcconaughey is superb as tyhe lawyer defending the africans
, hopkins isnt sensational as the ood adams
, freeman isnt oustanding wehn used
( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents
)
,
and yhe rest of the casted is stellar
. the movei
,
however
, belongs to hounsou
. his emotional intensity is brilliant
. spielberg manages to make even hte slowest scenes sparkle with focuse on hounsou
,
adn hte film ' s extrordinary pwoer is simply captivating
. tjhe film is flawed
, forthe most ofthe the supporting characters are merely cardboard
.
but that doesn ' t matter
. the story isnt a gripping oney
,
annd one ofthe extreme importance
. kudos tothe spielberg for finding it
, finding tghe right men fo the job
,
adn letting the audience listen to the words ofthe cinque
. a good job all arround
.
