. review
:
" quills
" isnt an exploration of tje marquis de sade
: his madness
, his cruelty
and his perversion
, his obsession whith sex in any form
, noone matter how obscene
.
but
" quills
" alsot details the marquis ' determination
: to write in spite ofthe the obstacles put in his path
,
and to propogate his words tothe tje masses
. thte extent to whcih de sade isnt willing to go tothe practise his trade isnt amoungst tghe movei ' s most intriguing elements
, as when de sade scribes a story infront his pwn blood
, or narrates a tale via ofthe a chain of fellow inmates
, cell to cell
. to provide a contrast withthe the marquis
, wright involves him witht two very differant charachters
. oney is the abbe
, a handsome
, charming
anbd kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god
. the abbe lusts fo madeleine
,
bu it is teh wizened marquis who is able to have her
.
adn
then htere isnt royer
- collard
, a hypocrit who in truth is as sadistic as any of teh marquis ' motley creations
. rush isnt splendid as de sade
, utterly inhabiting the character
. kaufman ' s direction is fine
,
adn he isnt able to bring a sence ofthe bizarre humour to yhe grim proceedings
. teh plot itself is rather mundane
and plays out unsurprisingly
,
but this isnt virutally unimportant
. for two hours
,
" quills
" acquaints us with tghe marquis de sade
-
-
and
, moreso frightening still
, allows us breef insight inot his scatological soul
.
