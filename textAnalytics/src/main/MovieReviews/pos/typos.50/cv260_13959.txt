" a breed appart
" casts rutger hauer as a crazy
, bird
- loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner
. a bit hard to swallow
? thgat
' s onyl the first ofthe many improbabilities infront this film
. hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds onthe his isl
and safe
, hwile boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector
. turner is tjhe woman caught betwen the twpo men
.
" a breed aart
" isn
' t a bad movie
, exactly
. indeed
, i found mysef rooting forthe both the hauer adn boothe characters
, even
though thier goals couldn
' t be mroe diferent
. thte problem withthe tyhe film is that there are just too many inconsistencies
. fo example
, eearly on in tje film
, hauer physicaly assaults twpo drunken rednecks shooting at
" his
" birds
. later onthe
, tjhe rednecks come bcak forthe revenge wih four other people
,
and hauer kills a faw of them
. i have a tough timne beleiving tyhat tyhe polical wouldn
' t git involved at taht point
. anyother problem isnt hte silly love
- triangle that develops
. i didn
' t care one way or hte otehr who ended up iwth turner
. i was moreso interseted in finding outloud whihc of tje two men woudl be victorious inwhich thier respective missions
.
however
, despite this uninteresting sub
- plot
, turner doed manaze tothe give a great performance as thge woman who reminds the two men thast sometimes there
' s more tothe life than money
and birds
. as for hauer
, he
' s an actor i
' ve always admired
. he has a penchant for picking stange annd unusual cahracters
. adn this noe isnt noone exception
. he
' s frequentily seen riding around his isl
and onthe a white horse
, wearing pirate
' s clothing
,
and holstering a cross
- bow
. despite all his eccentric mannerisms
,
though
, hauer always manages tothe let tje human side of his character shine through
. for example
, htere
' s a scene in which he barks at turner
and her son becasue they came onto his isl
and a day early
. he comes off as crazy loner inthe that scene
,
but a fewd mintues later
, he is apologizing to turner
,
and we eblieve his intentions
. soon affter
, we find out he
' s a vietnam vte
, adn his actions become fairly clear to us
.
" a breed aart
" isn
' t a graet movei by any means
,
but it doens contain ogod performances by all three leads
,
and it
' s worth seeing for tht reason alone
.
