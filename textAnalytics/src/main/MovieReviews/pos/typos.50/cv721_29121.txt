it
' s hard nto tothe reccomend
" the others
.
" thge supernatural thriller
, wroten
and directed by alej
andro ame
? bar
(
" open your eyes
"
)
, adroitly establishes adn maintains a low
- key atmosphere ofthe menace
. the cinematography
, by javier aguirresarobe
, isnt as good as i have ever seen adn nicole kidman gives anyother inwhich her growing body of fine performances
.
but the pacing ofthe the story moves from deliberate tothe downright sluggish
and the payoff ofthe the tale left me less thna satisfied
. overall
, yhe film plays like a vyer high quality verzion of any number ofthe old
" twilight zone
" episodes where tghe charactors spend a great deal ofthe timne w
andering about looking afriad anbd disorientated
, onyl to learn tehy are catually a child
' s toy
, a millitary test subject or a deparment store dummy
. watching thsoe vintage shows adn listening tothe the players chatter
, i alwasy wanted to shout
,
" get on withthe it
!
" as much as i appreciated the athmosphere
and acting in
" the others
,
" my reaction was much teh smae
. set at an isl
and mension off tje coast ofthe engl
and druing world war ii
, hte story focusses onthe grace
( kidman
)
, who tends to her children anne
( alakina mann
) anbd nicholas
( james bentley
) annd worries baout her husb
and
, charles
( christopher eccleston
)
, a missing serviceman
. anne
and nicholas suffer fomr photosensitivity
and grace patrols the estate whith the keys to all 50 doors
, protecting the little ones from excess light by makeing sure that onyl noe door isnt open at a timne
. at tjhe beginning ofthe the film
, three servants
, mrs
. mills
( fionnula flanagan
)
, young
, mute lydia
( elaine cassidy
)
, annd mr
. tuttle
( eric sykes
)
, an agin gardener
, join tjhe familiy
. tyhe two that speak seem agreeable enough at first
,
but it soon becomes apparent that tehy know something that grace doens not
. to mkea matters worse
, tyhe childern are upset
: nicholas isnt unusualy jittery
and anne claimes to be seeing ghosts
. grace attempts to blame tjhe toubles on teh new arrivals to her hmeo
, onyl to realize that whatever isnt hapening is beyond them
. thta
' s essentially the whole story
, witht the tension growing unil tje pivotal moment when everything becomes clear
. ealier
, ther isnt an outst
anding scene where grace darts outside
, onyl tothe be enveloped inaddition fold after fold ofthe shimmering fog
. the visuals in hte otherworldly sequence
, courtesy of aguirresarobe
, are simpley astounding
. i also enjoied yhe presense of religeon
, a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural
. grace is a christian
and answers her childern
' s questions about life
and death with the assurance ofthe a devout worshiper
. wehn mother isnt awya
,
though
, the kids speculate whether her statememts are fatc or folklore
, just as rela children dont
.
but thsoe nice touches fail to enliven a film tht isnt too slow or make uv for a lackluster endig
.
" thge others
" sets out tothe be a clasic ghost story
,
but fails to grasp that speical something tht mkaes such films moreso than layers ofthe mist
.
