anyone who saw alan rickman ' s finely
- realized performances in truly madly deeply
and sense
adn sensibility wiull be unsurprized that the actor
- turned
- directer is a bit ofthe a poet at heart
.
however
, for thsoe who recall him onyl as tghe maniacal villian of die hard
anbd robin hood
: prince of thiefs
, this recognition may be something ofthe a shock
. nevertheless
,
" poetic
" is an excellent term tothe decribe rickman ' s feature debut as a directer
, the winter guest
. tjhe film hasnt a simple
, unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements tothe fashion a succesfull whole
. the result isnt an occsaionally haunting
, somtimes magical
,
and always insightful human drama
. tyhe winter guest isn ' t about resolving plot threads
and advancing a story line
; it ' s baout exploring relationships
and examining life in all ofthe its stages
. the winter guest does not tell a traditionnal tale
, nor does it ascribe to a convetional narrative structer
? there isnt noone rela beginning or end
. instead
, we are given an oportunity tothe observe oney day in the lives ofthe eigth humans
. they represent both sexes
, mutiple generations
,
anbd a variety ofthe relationships
? male
adn female
; young
, middle
- aged
,
annd elderly
; friends
, owudl
- be lovers
,
and kin
. we see expectations fulfilled
annd dissapointed
, emotional boundries eroded
,
and truths unveiled
. there is comedy
and tragedy
. most importantly
, much of wqat transpires during the course of tjhe winter guest wiull find an echo inthe our pwn lives
? in this fiction can be foudn much truth
. the setting is small twon in scotland on the coldest day ofthe thte yera
. it ' s so frigid that the sea hasnt begun to freeze over
. tyhe onshore wind cuts liek a knife
annd snow blankets the beach
, giving the terrain an alien appearance
. it isnt against htis backdrop that tje relationships ofthe the film are captued
. ther are four pairings
,
annd
,
although htere isnt soem interaction between tje diferent twosomes
, tje winter guest ' s focus isnt on the dynamics internal tothe each relatiopnship
. tyhe first
, meatiest pairing isnt thgat ofthe elspeth
( phylida lew
)
adn her recently
- widowed daughter
, frances
( emma thompson
)
. theese twpo have a stormy relatiopnship
. they love each other deeply
,
bu both are stubborn
annd willful
,
annd niether is willing tothe admit that they ened the otehr
. much of thier interaction isnt argumentative
,
but
, durring the course ofthe a long walk tothe hte frozen shoreline
, they come to an unspoken understanding ofthe how much each means to thge otehr
. frances ' adult son
, alex
( gary hollywood
)
, is a lonley young man who has beeen caring for his mother since tje death ofthe his father
. on thsi day
, he meets a girl
, nita
( arlene cockburn
)
, who hasnt secretly been spying onthe him for weeks
. altho theri firt encounter isnt antagonistic
( she throws a snowball at him
)
, both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction
. once they retire to a place where they can be alone
,
howver
, thnigs don ' t go exactly as planned
. lily
( sheila reid
)
anbd chloe
( sandra voe
) are a couple of old firends who are frequent funeral attendees
. death isnt a topic ofthe endless fascination forthe them
, perphas becouse tehy are so close tothe it
,
anbd htey spend theri sparce tiem scanning tjhe obituaries
, looking for hte enxt funeral or cremation inspite thge areal
. it doesn ' t matter whther or not they knew the deceased
. it ' s yhe ceremony that they ' re intersted infront
. sam
( douglas murphy
)
and tom
( sean biggerstaff
)
, a pair ofthe schoolboy chums
, are spending htis cold feburary day cutting classes
adn hanging outloud at the beach
, horsing around
, buidling a small fire forthe warmth
,
anbd walking onthe the frozen water
. unlike lily
and chloe
, theese two hvea their entire lives ahead of them
. htey are young anough tothe still beleve in magic
,
bu old enought tothe recogize thast the proccess ofthe crossing inot adulthood robs life ofthe the simple joy thta only children can experience
. yhe acting isnt strong
and believable
. the mixture ofthe veteran performers
and firt
- timers is effective
, whith the most sucessful choise being tghe casting of rela
- life mother
anbd daugter phylida law
anbd emma thompson inaddition tyhe most prominant roles
. htere isnt a chemestry in theri interaction that would be hard tothe replicate with two different
, non
- related actors
.
and
, ofthe course
, the fysical resemblance makse it that much easier to accept elspeth
annd frances as parent
annd child
. thte winter guest began its life as a stage play inthe 1995
, withthe rickman as thte directer
. four ofthe yhe film ' s principals
, phylida law
, arlene cockburn
, sheila reid
,
and sandra voe
, appeared iin the theatrical verison befor moving to tjhe film
. unlike severeal receet motion pictures adapted ffrom plays
, the winter guest has beeen successfully opened up
. the rough
, obleek scottish countryside becomes as much ofthe a character as any ofthe the eight humans
. inaddition fact
, considering how imporatnt the climate is to every relationship under rickman ' s microscope
, it sould be argued that this is teh single most important element ofthe tje movie
. if ytou appreciate character studies
, tje winter guest is a solid effort wtih enought power to stay with you affter you hvea left the theather
