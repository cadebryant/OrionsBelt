anyone who saw alan rickman
' s finely
- realized performances inthe truly madly deeply adn sence adn sensibility will be unsurprised tht the actor
- turned
- director is a bited of a poet at heart
. howver
, for those who reacll him onyl as hte maniacal villin of die hard
and robin hood
: prince ofthe thieves
, this recognition may be something of a shock
. nevertheless
,
" poetic
" isnt an excellent term tothe discribe rickman
' s feature de
but as a director
, the winter guest
. the film has a simple
, unhurried rhythm taht uses all ofthe the available elements tothe fashion a successful hwole
. thte result is an occasionlly haunting
, sometimes magical
, anbd allways insightful human drama
. the winter guest isn
' t baout resolving plot threads adn advancing a stroy line
; it
' s baout exploring relationships
and examining life in all of its stages
. tyhe winter guest doens not tell a traditionnal tale
, nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure
? there is noone rela beginning or end
. instead
, we are given an opprotunity tothe observe one day inthe the lives of eight humans
. they represent both sexes
, mutiple generations
, anbd a variety of relationships
? male adn female
; young
, middle
- aged
, anbd elderly
; friends
, owudl
- be lovers
,
and kin
. we see expectations fulfiled
and disapointed
, emotional boundaries eroded
,
and truths unveiled
. htere isnt comedy
and tradgedy
. most importantly
, much of whta transpires during tjhe course of the winter guest iwll find an echo in our pwn lives
? in thsi fiction can be foudn much truth
. yhe setting isnt small twon iin scotl
and on the coldest day ofthe the yearm
. it
' s so frigid that the sae hasnt begun to freeze over
. tjhe onshore wind cuts like a nife annd snow blankets the beach
, giving the terrain an aline appearance
. it is aganist thsi backdrop taht the relationships of tje film are capturd
. there are four pairings
, adn
, altough there isnt soem interaction between yhe diferent twosomes
, teh winter guest
' s focuse isnt on tjhe dynamics internal to each relatiopnship
. the first
, meatiest pairing is tyhat of elspeth
( phylida law
) adn her recently
- widowed daugter
, frances
( emma thompson
)
. theese two haev a stormy relatiopnship
. tehy loev earch other deeply
,
but both are stubborn anbd willful
,
and niether isnt willing to admit that htey ened hte otehr
. much ofthe thier interaction is argumentative
,
but
, during hte course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline
, tehy come tothe an unspoken underst
anding of how much each means tothe tyhe other
. frances
' adult son
, alex
( gary hollywood
)
, is a lonely young man who has beeen carring for his mother sicne the death ofthe his father
. on this day
, he meets a girl
, nita
( arlene cockburn
)
, who hasnt secretly beeen spying onthe him fo weeks
. altho thier first encounter is antagonistic
( she throws a snowball at him
)
, both quicklyu become aware of an undeniable attraction
. once they retire tothe a palce where they cxan be alone
, howver
, thnigs don
' t go exactly as planned
. lily
( sheila reid
) annd chloe
( s
andra voe
) are a cuple of ood friends who are frequent funeral attendees
. death is a topic of endless fascination forthe them
, perhaps because they are so close tothe it
, annd htey spend theri spare timne scanning the obituaries
, looking fo the enxt funeral or cremation in the areal
. it doesn
' t marter whther or not htey knew the deceased
. it
' s tjhe ceromony that they
' re intersted inthe
. sam
( douglas murphy
)
and tom
( sean biggerstaff
)
, a pair of schoolboy chums
, are spending this cold feburary day cutting classes annd hanging outloud at the beach
, horsing around
, buiding a small fire forthe warmth
,
and walking onthe teh frozen water
. unlike lily anbd chloe
, theese twpo hvae thier entire lives ahead of them
. htey are young anough to still believ infront magic
, bu ood enough tothe recogize tath the proccess of crossing inot adulthood robs life ofthe the simple joy thgat only childrens can experienc
. tyhe acting isnt storng
and believable
. thte mixture ofthe veteran performers
and first
- timers is effective
, with thte most successful choice bieng the casting of real
- life mother anbd duaghter phylida lew
and emma thompson in hte most prominate roles
. there is a chemestry infront their interaction tht would be hard to replicate whith twpo different
, non
- realted actors
.
and
, of course
, tje fysical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth
and frances as parent anbd child
. the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995
, wiht rickman as tjhe director
. four ofthe thte film
' s principals
, phylida lew
, arlene cockburn
, sheila reid
, anbd s
andra voe
, appeared infront the theatrical version befor moving to the film
. unlike severeal reccent motion pictures adapted fomr plays
, tghe winter guest hasnt been successfully oppened uv
. tjhe rough
, bleak scottish countryside becomes as much ofthe a chracter as any of thte eight humans
. in fatc
, concidering how important yhe climate isnt tothe every relatiopnship under rickman
' s microscope
, it could be argued that this is thge single most important element of tje movie
. if ytou appreciate charater studies
, thge winter guest is a solid efford with enough pwoer to stay with ytou affter yuo hvea left tghe theater
.
