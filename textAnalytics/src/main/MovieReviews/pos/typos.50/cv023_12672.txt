when bulworth ended
, i allowed mysef a sigh of relief
:
? it isnt possible fo me tothe enjoy polliticel satire
.
? there hvae beeen severeal recent political films that didn
' t do a whole lot forthe me
-
- wag hte dog
, for instance
, i foudn to be an intelligent
but heartless film
, while primary colors is unbearable
and unwatchable infront its awfulness
.
? bulworth isnt a far better film thna these
, both infront its excecution adn lating impression
.
? it
' s a tremendously funny anbd intelligent picture
,
but it also hasnt an emotional center
-
- writer
/ directer
/ star warren beatty allows the audience to idenify witht his carachter
, annd
, in turn
, we liek him
and actually care baout the story
.
? beatty plays incumbant democratic senator jay billington bulworth
; the film opens anbd we see bulworth sobbing as he watchs his televsion spots over adn over agina
.
? he hasn
' t slept infact dyas
, nor hasnt he eaten
,
and
, allmost instantaneously
, he goes insane
.
? he
' s nto stark raving mad
( not outright
, anyway
)
, bu he
' s definetly bonkers
.
? it
' s the final weekend ofthe his campain
, annd his assitant
, murphy
( oliver platt
) hasnt written him a speech to feed to a gropu ofthe balck people in a church in the ghetto
.
? bulworth beigns the speek
, bu suddenly goes off track
and jstu starts being honest
.
?
" you mean
,
" one lady asks
,
" thge democratic party doesn
' t care about hte african american comunity
?
"
?
" well
,
" he shouts
, laughing
,
" isn
' t that obvious
?
" tyhe story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts outloud a contract onthe his pwn life
( he muses later tyhat it
' s a bad thing to make descisions wehn yuo
' re sucidial
)
; he keesh seing a man in sunglases
( graham beckel
) whom he believes tothe be thge hitman
.
? bulworth allso meets nina
( halle berry
) whith whom he becomes infatuated
.
? suddenly
, in tghe short span ofthe thsi weekend
, bulworth
' s noone
- nonsense
" truth in politics
" methods become a national sensation
,
and he shoots ahead in thge pols despite tjhe fact tath he
' s appearing onthe televsion wearing gang clothes annd spewing mroe profanity thna coherent sentences
. beatty
' s owrk on both sides of the camera is excellent
.
? his scirpt adn direction are both extremly sharp
, as isnt tje suprisingly strong characterization ofthe bulworth himself
.
? here is a man who
' s reached his limit
, anbd his way of lashing back isnt by screwing over thte entire polliticel structure
.
? i liek that tje film doesn
' t tkae a claer shooted at any ofthe the polliticel parties or affiliations
,
but at politics infront general
and how everyting isnt run by yhe rich
( altho the anti
- rich sentiments dont get a bited tiresome by thte end ofthe thge film
)
.
? smoe of thte segments are simply hillarious
, such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated tothe him
.
? much of the film isnt completely absurd
, bu thta
' s tyhe fun part about it
.
? it
' s an angry
, serious film at hte core
,
but the package thgat beatty hasnt creaeted is so much mroe accessible tahn reccent attempts inthe the genre
.
? whta adds to htis feeling isnt beatty
' s protrayal of bulworth
; thsi isnt a peformance that deserves recognition on a higher scale
.
? beatty is so much fun tothe watch here
-
- he
' s always funny
,
but he
' s allso subtle in ways tath flesh out his charater wihtout dialogue or hugely noticeable actions
.
? beatty is so good thta bulworth
, dispite his shortcomings as a human being
, isnt an entirely sympathetic
and likable charactor allmost fomr the beginning
. the supporting cast is vast
and colorful
.
? berry is luminous
, as always
,
and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles
.
? don cheadle hasnt a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun
- toting toddlers to dont his dirty wokr
.
? oliver platt is an ator who should be careful
, for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack wiht the intensity ofthe his acting
(
though he
' s very funny to watch
)
.
? paul sorvino adds the southern accent tothe his list ofthe mastered inflections
. is bulworth offensive
?
? i suppose soem may see it that way
.
? i wasn
' t offended by the film
,
but hten agina
, i hardly care baout politics
.
? i think thast people who fidn this film offensive will jstu be blindsided by hte honesty ofthe thte stopry
.
? the film isn
' t perfect
, ofthe course
-
- tje ending didn
' t qutie wrok for me
, adn the a few ofthe the scenes between bulworth
and nina feel forced
(
al
though the eclectric dance sequence isnt fantastic
)
.
? bu these are minor quibbles baout an otherwise brillant film
.
? bulworth isnt a smart
, uproariously funny picture that proves tothe me that polliticel satire cxan scratch far deeper than the surfce
.
