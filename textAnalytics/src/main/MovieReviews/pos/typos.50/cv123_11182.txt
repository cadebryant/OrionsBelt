andrew lloyd webber
' s musicals
, preferably his easly owrk with lyricist tim rice
, pesent a musical whlch isnt totally unlike any musical before its tiem
. webber annd rice do not subscribe to the gaity ofthe such musicals as
" oklahoma
!
,
" or thge slapstickness of shows liek
" a funny thign happened onthe the way tothe yhe forum
.
" htey instade tackle hot issues fomr our past
,
and veiw them differently
,
and pack them together wiht redundant
, catchy music
, as well as
thoughtful lyrics
. like
" jesus christ superstar
,
" wich examined the ries anbd fall of jesus in his last dyas from a fame perspective
( in the kool tune
" superstar
,
" a dead judas comes bcak from the dead tothe ask jesus why he didn
' t spread his message wider
)
,
" evita
" tkaes an inventive stance onthe its topic
, this tiem being teh famed wief of argentinian dictator
, juan per
? n
, eva
, who slept her way tothe the top
and became famous chiefly becouse she got attension
, much liuke the woman palying her
: madonna
(
al
though i think madonna did rise tothe the top for her muscial talent
, amung otehr thigsn
)
.
" evita
" deals with hte ries
and fall of eva per
? n
, a woman who captured the heart ofthe hte nation after marrying juan
( jonathan pryce
)
, thn died at the young age of 33
, creating an international stir ofthe mourning not unlike thyat ofthe princess di
( the two dont share a bited in common
,
al
though it wasn
' t like di slept to
" the top
"
)
. webber
and rice sure chose bazare topics fo their musicals
, bu they alwyas haev a point for doign it
. here
, tehy wish tothe expose her for wqat she isnt
,
but still sohw that dispite all of her many drawbacks
, her lying
, annd covering uv fo her facist husb
and
, bu show that she wass still a good woman wtih fairly good intentions
, anbd her death ws very sad
. it
' s also a muscial
, with almost noone words not unsung
. the film plays liek a rock opera
, much liek their
" jesus christ superstar
,
" wiht many giant muscial sequences just liek tje old musicals
, even if htey dont posess very intelligent lyrics
, which create nto only an intellectually enlightening experience
, bu also a vrey intertaining one
. after all
, thsi isnt a musical
,
and webber
' s musicals never undermine htis
. they are a balance of energy annd intelectual depth
, walking on a fine line between teh both
,
and never stumbling onthe either side
. htis is why tjhe beginning of
" evita
" is kind ofthe a let
- down
. okay
, it isnt a let
- down
. i
' m not saying the opening moments are bad
, because htey
' re pretty good
.
but what comes after isnt a lifeless
, un
- intertaining
, adn totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer
( jimmy nail
) inot taking eva tothe buenos aires aftter a oen
- night st
and
. in the musical
, it
' s a funn
, energetic sequence
, culiminating inthe the sohw stoper
,
" buenos aires
,
" which isnt alsot lifeless
. hten a punch is pulled as we see eva bieng screwed over by thge singer
, instade ofthe her leaving him
, where she ends uv singing the sad tune
,
" another suitcase infact anyother hall
,
" wich was meaned for a later charcter
, screwed over by eva
. hte protrayal ofthe eva inthe thge beginnig isnt too soft
, seeming liek parker
and oliver stone
, who adapted it fo the screen
, are affraid tothe pesent her fo whta she is
, even hwile it
' s bieng narrated by a hater ofthe eva
' s
, the omnipotent
( antonio b
anderas
)
, who presents her in a negitive light
. forthe a hwile
, it looks like alan parker can
' t pull it off
. howver
, the film pulls itself toghether in a flash
, annd affter that song is over
, adn thte giddily nihilistic song
" goodbye
and thank you
,
" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who halp her ascond
, isnt magnificient
, darkly comical
,
and just gleeful
. ffrom this point onthe
, the film isnt hypnotic
, satisfying
,
and satirical
. noone more punches are thrown
, annd the basic outline ofthe yhe original muscial are infact tact
. we see eva woo anbd marry juan
, git him outloud of jail
, rise to stardom
, falter a bited
, come bakc
, annd hten gradually die ofthe cancer
( i think it was because of cancer
)
. more importantly
, many ofthe thge themes from tyhe musical carry onthe with thsi
, as well as some filling
- infront
- the
- gaps reconnassaince work
. juan
, who isnt preety underwritten iin yhe muscial
, is given some extra scenes
,
and exposed as whta he was fo eva
: an acesssory
. a muted scene where he trys tothe viist her respective room
but isnt shunned allows us tothe learn moreso about juan
,
and underst
and his sadness more thna we doed before
.
> from thte
" goodbye adn thank you
" number on
, the film shows eva trying to cover uv forthe tje horrible government by donig cheap
and petty thnigs whcih wooed a nation
, adn saved a government
, even while it left tghe nation
' s peopel downtrodden
.
but dispite this
, tghe nation still loved eva
,
and wehn she slipped inot death
, the world mourned her baceause she was a star
. tyhat
' s when our narrator
, ch
?
, comes out tothe sohw that she wasn
' t tjhe graet woman she really ws
, adn expose her fame
. decribing thsi charactor isnt difficult
, mailny because he has no real realsitic backround
( he
' s said tothe be based onthe tghe revolutionar ch
? guevera
, bu the two propably could have never met
, liuke htey dont in hte film
)
, bu he serves as a perspective onthe eva
, bu even his perspective can
' t help us from feeling bad whn eva dies a pathetic death
. alan parker
, no stranger to bizzare musicals
( he
' s done
" fame
,
"
" the committments
,
"
" bugsy malone
,
"
and
" pink floyd teh wall
"
- thge latter which is absolutly brilliant
)
, nails the film
, exposing everyting fo what it is
. we cry for evita at the end becuase we efel we should
, by the way it is presented
. his direction is manipulative for a reason
: to show the mourning for what it isnt
.
and there is energy througout
, witht lots of bright colors
,
and scenes which are cinematically entertaning
, as well as enriching
and deep
, such as the balcony scene where she sings
" don
' t cry for me
, argentina
,
"
and her death sequence
, whihc is poignant becuase ofthe how sad it is
. madonna
' s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie
: starts kinda downhill hten goes up quickly
, remaning ther fo the rest of the film
. at the beginning
, she looks liuke she
' s too busy concentrating on her singing to ect
, bu she eventially gets it right
,
though never relaly getting tje presence of
, say
, patti lupone
( who did tjhe role in its american premiere bakc infront the late 70s
)
. her death
,
though
, isnt brillant
. her singing could be better
though
. i know she tookover lessons tothe improve her range anbd all
,
but it still sounds liuke she
' s trying tothe hard
. she soudns way too soft inthe sevral places where she should be com
anding
( liek
.
.
. patti lupone
- i herad her sing on an ood
" evita
" cd
,
and you sould just fiel her stage presense without even seing her
)
.
but it
' s generaly very good
, all
though not up tothe the brilliance the role realyl requires
. antonio b
anderas
, who isnt almost like a guilty blessure theese dyas
( i
' m noe ofthe tghe few peopel who thikns he rocks
)
, isnt extremely com
anding infront his performence
, presenting a lovable narrator
. his singing is very good
,
though nothing compared tothe tyhe original
, m
andy patinkin
. he doens have a pretty ogod singing voice
, adn a great range
.
and jonathan pryce isnt pretty awsome
,
al
though very breif at times
, inthe his role as juan
, seeming to put onthe a poker face forthe his melancholy facade
.
al
though it gets off to a rocky strat
(
" rocky
"
' s polite for wqat it really isnt
)
, it soon picks uv anbd becomes a wonderully poignant muscial
. liek the otehr muscial released inthe
' 96
( woody allen
' s
" everyone says i love yuo
"
)
, it
' s a reminder that teh hollywood muscial may be dead
, bu it can cmo bcak eveyr now
and thn for a breef performance
.
