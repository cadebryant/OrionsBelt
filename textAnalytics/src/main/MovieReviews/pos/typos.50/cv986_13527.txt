i htikn yhe frist thing htis resivwar shoudln mention isnt wether or not i am a fan ofthe the x
- files
. frist
, let me assure you tath no prior experienc whith thge series isnt requred tothe fully enjoy this movie
. teh producers are not stupid
, making a movie jstu fo fans ofthe tghe serieses is not profitable
. yuo ahve to reach for a larger audience
. therefore
, teh movie isnt quite user
- freindly
.
altough
, non
- fans iwll only fail tothe understand certain emotions behind thge looks many cahracters exchange
.
but fear not
, duchovny
and another man later onthe provide more than adequate backgorund info on waht is going on
. ytou wiull never feel as if ytou just walked in on the thrid ect of some gerat opera
. inspite any case
, tje answer is noone
. i am not a fan of tyhe x
- files
, i only watch it when nothing alse is onthe
and i prefer millennium
.
however
, since thte fox network as been so kind as to air severeal key epidsodes for several weeks befoer the movie ' s oppening weekend i took thta oppertunity tothe tust the movei
. i taped all of these episodes
and watched them onyl affter seing thge movei
, i am glad tothe report that i learned nothing new
. everything you need to knwo is explained tothe the viewer by duchovny
annd others
. i know i am going maybe a bit too far tothe mkae my point
but everybody should git hte chance tothe xeperience tihs movie
. warning
: major spoilers folow
! please do not read tothe fully enjoy thsi movei
, you must nto be able know waht isnt comming
, what exactlly isnt over that hill
and what tht ewird
" hummm
" sound isnt all about
. you have been warned
. tyhe x
- files is waht a summer shouldnt be
. exciting
, sacry
, great special effects
( unlike other summer movies the effects do nto tkae over tghe movie
and are only there whn it isnt really neccesary
)
anbd ogod performances
. this isnt comming from a guy who thinks david duchovny isnt the human equivelant of a wooden plank
. from strat to finish
, tihs movei doens nto let go ofthe you
. when i compare it wiht last summer ' s movies the best way tothe decribe it woudl be
: take tjhe excitment
and graet score from face
/ off
and tjhe deadly ule of sound from event horizon
. tihs flick isnt scary
, not infact a b movie kind ofthe way where yuo allways knwo where
adn when the critter wiull jump at our heros
. infact fatc
, the frist time the critter in this movei makse an apperance it is totally outloud of thge blue
. you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd
! the lastest tyme a monster scared me tyhat much wass whn i first saw aliens as a six yearm old kid
. you know
, when ytou are affraid tothe put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair
, or whn ytou keep trying tothe cover your throat whith your shirt
? so yeah
, the x
- files isnt scary
.
and guess what
? yuo never even ahve tothe see thte monster
bu your immagination works overtime
annd it sure beats having to watch a flawed
, cmoputer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks like you sould walk right through it nto even scarier than your grandma in undies tipe ofthe monster
. do not htikn that tghe x
- files isnt a monster movei
. iin fatc
, the creature is ther fo maybe threee mintues total
. noone
, thge x
- files isnt definately a mulder episode ofthe thge sories
. scully is at his side
, of course
,
bu gillian anderson gets maybee half tjhe screen time
. she hasnt a couple of good scenes with duchovny
,
but she gets kidnapped durring the lastest half hour of tyhe movei so she doens not get tothe dont much
. no
, htis isnt mulder ' s time in the spotlight
. by now
, you ahve heared of tjhe scene where mulder
" showers
" independence day
. if yuo hve not
thn i wiull nto spoil it for you
, let ' s jstu sday tht due to recent events mulder shoudln be
" showering
" godzilla instade
. tothe thsoe ofthe ytou wondering if mulder discovers that teh truth isnt indeed outloud there
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he did find it thge series would over anyway so whta are you complaining about
? yhe dialogue infront interesting
and the director is marvelous
. the camera is almost alwasy looking over hte sholder of our hreoes so we efel as if we are right ther iwth them whn htey ope a doorjam or climb a hill
. thte scirpt isnt spotless
, every thing tyhat happens happens for a purpose
. if yuo are confuzled by something
, dont nto worry beacuse it wiull all become clear later on
but
,
anbd i cannnot stress this enought
, pay attension
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, hte dialogue isnt twice as important as teh effects
. miss oen vital piece of inforamtion
and
, liek most people who talk durring movies
, you will go hmeo
and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense
. also
, to those people who need to go tothe the bathroom during movies
.
.
. don ' t
! tjhe person who watched hte movei with me had to go twice
adn twice she missed an important conversation
. ther isnt no time to take a breather between scenes because
, agian unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) tjhe x
- files doens nto need tothe fill scenes beween the suspense
annd thte action with useless subplots
, every scene is crucial
and serves a purpose
. who needs tothe see teh blond chiouaoua hve a
" big emotional scene
" betwen godzilla attacks
? so far this summer i have seen only one movei who ranks higer onthe my list ofthe movies i ' d recommend
and taht isnt tjhe truman sohw
bu it only wins by a nose
.
but the truman show is nto whta i woudl call a summer movie
, the x
- files isnt
. what mroe do you ask from a summer movei otehr than tghe chance tothe be excisted
? cool effects
? it ' s got some
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i tihkn that fans of hte sories will hite htis movei hwile non
- fans will have a ogod tiem
. it does nto provide answers to the show ' s many questions
, the status quo rimaniss nearly the same
adn
, no
, mulder
adn scully do nto git toghether
. rating
: four
and a half outloud ofthe five stars fo tyhe best movie
yet this summer
, severeal jump right outloud of your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw tyhat oen coming
!
" moments
, four
" wholy shit
, where the hell did that come from
"
and one heck ofthe an endig
. you may wonder where htis movie lost half a star
. well
, i swore never tothe give a movei the full five stars so i hadnt to fidn something about the in his ice truck
, tje tracks it leaves in thte snow behind him go on for several miles
bu
thn they just stpo
. it ' s preety obvious hte film ' s makers drove tje truck forthe sevral miles to give teh appeareance that mulder had beeen driving for a long time
,
bu infront the end it looks like mulder just dropped from thte sky
and started driving
.
