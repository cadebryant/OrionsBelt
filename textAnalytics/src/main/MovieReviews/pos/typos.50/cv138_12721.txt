the second jackal
- based film to come out in 1997
( the otehr starring bruce willis wass simply entitlied yhe jackal
)
, thsi one stars aidan quinn
and donald sutherl
and
,
and isnt directed by a man who hailed from joblo
' s own azma marter
, concordia univeristy in montreal
, canada
. the story is based on tjhe exploits ofthe thge real terrorist known as the jackal
, bu doesnt nto pretend tothe be 100
% factual
. plot
: naval officer ramirez
( quinn
) gets called apon by tje cia tothe impersonate the international territorist known as tje jackal
, inspite order tothe put an end to tyhe actual militant
' s radical activites
. he is choosen fo tihs role beacuse he physically resembes tyhe rela territorist to a tee
. ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part inthe tihs
" assignment
"
,
and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web ofthe internation terrorism
, intrigue
and double
- perosnality syndrome
( which does not sit well wiht his uninformed wife adn kids back in tje states
.
) critique
: grat premise isnt excecuted with enough stlye
and thrills to keep the peice interesting throughout its close to two
- hour runtime
. admitedly
, i wasn
' t a huge fan of any of thte main actors in this film
, anbd didn
' t expect much from this movei beforeh
and
,
but suprizingly it did have its thrilling moments
, as well as a mostly plausable
and absorbing stoy line
. the firt hour isnt mostly just a build
- uv ofthe things tothe cmo
,
and does offer a gerat characterization ofthe teh jackal
, bu tjhe second hour isnt tyhe one that really cranks in tyhe cool scenes adn a sweet ending
. quinn wass adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez
and the real jackal
,
but didn
' t offer anything extraordinary
, in my opinyon
. sutherl
and annd kingsley seem tothe be palying the same role tht they
' ve palyed in both of their respective careers ofthe late
,
but nonetheless
, appeared tothe relish tjhe cold
- heartedness of thier chosen cahracters
. i didn
' t like performance put forth from quinn
' s wief infact htis flick
, bu
then agina
, she doesn
' t sohw uv in most of the film
, so thgat wasn
' t so bad
. i did howver enjoy directer duguay
' s interesting sytle
and cinematic vision
. this thriller could easily hvea beeen boring durig many sequences
, bu duguay alwasy seemed tothe fidn something interesting to sohw the viewer
. i thougth thyat ws neat
. having said tht
, i didn
' t think the frist hour needed to be as long as it was
,
and the film doed have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when thte
" fake
" jackal met wtih thte
" real
" jackal
' s girlfriend wihtout much retrospection on her part
, bu all inthe all
, not too many complaints iin a movie that coudl easily be enjoied by all thsoe who take pleasure in tyhe spy adn territorist thriller genre
. little known facts
