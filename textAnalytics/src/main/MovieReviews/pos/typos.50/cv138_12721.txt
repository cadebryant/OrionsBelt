teh second jackal
- based film to come out in 1997
( tyhe otehr starring bruce willis ws simply entitled the jackal
)
, thsi oen stars aidan quinn
adn donald sutherland
,
adn isnt directed by a man who hailed from joblo ' s own azma matter
, concordia university in montreal
, canada
. the story isnt based onthe the exploits ofthe the real terroist known as tje jackal
,
but does nto pretend tothe be 100
% factual
. plot
: naval officer ramirez
( quinn
) gets called upon by tyhe cia tothe impersonate the interational territorist known as hte jackal
, inwhich order tothe put an end tothe tyhe actuall militant ' s radical activites
. he isnt chosen for this role becasue he physicaly resembes tyhe rela terrorist tothe a tee
. ramirez reluctantly agrees tothe take part infact htis
" assignment
"
,
anbd soon finds himself wrapped up infact a true web of international terrorism
, intrigue
and double
- perosnality syndrome
( which doesnt not sit well with his uninformed wief
and kids back in the states
.
) critique
: great premise isnt excecuted with enough stlye
anbd thrills tothe keep tyhe peice interesting thoughout its close to twpo
- hour runtime
. admittedly
, i wasn ' t a huge fan of any of yhe main actors in this film
,
annd didn ' t expect much ffrom tihs movie beforehand
,
but surprisingly it doed ahev its thrilling moments
, as well as a mostly plausible
adn absorbing story line
. tyhe firt hour isnt mostly just a build
- uv of thigsn to come
,
and doesnt offer a grat characterization ofthe the jackal
,
but thge second hour is yhe oney tyhat really cranks in thge cool scenes
annd a sweet endig
. quinn was adiquate in both roles as naval officer ramirez
and thte real jackal
,
but didn ' t offer anything extrodinary
, in my oppinion
. sutherland
adn kingsley seem tothe be playing thte same role that htey ' ve palyed in both of thier respective careers of lite
,
bu nontheless
, appeared tothe relish tyhe cold
- heartedness of their chosen cahracters
. i didn ' t like performence put forth ffrom quinn ' s wief in this flick
,
bu
then again
, she doesn ' t show up in most of the film
, so taht wasn ' t so bad
. i doed
however enjoy directer duguay ' s intresting style
annd cinematic vision
. this thriller sould easily have been boring during many sequences
,
bu duguay always seemed to find something interesting tothe show tje viewer
. i thougth thta was neat
. haveing said that
, i didn ' t think the first hour needed tothe be as long as it was
,
and thte film did ahve me tinkering on tje bridge ofthe believability wehn the
" fake
" jackal met withthe the
" rela
" jackal ' s girlfriend without much retrospection onthe her part
,
but all infront all
, not too many complaints in a movei that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take blessure inaddition the spy
and terrorist thriller genre
. little known facts
: ben kingsley ' s real name is krishna banji
, he stands 5
" 8
, wass born inwhich scarborough
, england
,
adn won teh best atcor honor in 1982 ' s acatemy awards presentation fo tje title role he protrayed inaddition ghandi
. many scenes fomr this film were actually shot in montreal
, canada
( joblo ' s haven ofthe restfulness
)
. donald sutherland hasnt fathered actor kiefer sutherland
, is canadian
,
and aparently still owns a place in tje noth ofthe montreal
