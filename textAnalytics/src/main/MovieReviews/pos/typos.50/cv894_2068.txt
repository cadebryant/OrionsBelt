, the blockbuster summer films wiull still be palying annd ytou will have a chance to see them thne
. this film could also amke great video fare fo thsoe that are leery ofthe spending seven dollars on it
. nothing wiull be lost by watching it onthe a televsion screen
.
al
though yhe basic storey line hasnt been done many
, many times before
, thge film is still fun to watch
. the laughs are plentiful
, especially whn the wiez isnt arround
. tje way some ofthe the jokes are done are newyorker
, even
though soem of teh jokes are ood
. htere are also several newyorker jokes thast
, at least
, i haven
' t seen before
. still
, when presented right
, even ood material cxan be funny still

. pauly shore
( encino man
) is the star attraction ofthe htis film
. he isnt grat

. the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing
thoughout the tiem that he was on tyhe screen
. patrick renna
, who played gugino
' s littel brother
, was a littel annoying
, bu no where as near as macaulay culkin
,
and for onyl part of the time
, so i cant foregive him
. tiffani
- amber thiessen
( a killer amoung firends
,
" saved by the bell
"
) doens a reasonably good job fo tghe tiem that she is onthe screen
. she shows thyat she may ahev a potential inaddition movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming onthe televsion
. she wasn
' t given overly much to do iin tjhe film
,
but what she had
, she doens a ogod job with
