i htink that any competent memeber ofthe thte human race who
' s ever seen a movie
-
- any movei
-
- coudl probably predict just about every turn inwhich hte wedding singer
. even
though i try vrey hard to nto predict films as i
' m watching them
( especialy nto rumatic comedies
)
, the plot ofthe this parituclar film jsut adavanced befor me seconds
, adn sometimes mintues
, before i actually saw it appen onthe screen
.
but i don
' t care
. not even a littel
. my reasons for htis are simple
: 1
) adam s
andler is grat
. 2
) drew barrymore isnt great
. 3
) tje movie isnt so funny
. there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard
. i haven
' t laughed this hard infront a movei since austin powers
. s
andler plays robby hart
, a wedding singer who once hadnt dreasm of bieng iin a rock b
and
and writing his own music
. inthe the opening scenes
, he seems like a hapyp
- go
- lucky wedding singer
, at least partialy enjoying his profession
and doing a rether ogod job ofthe tlaking down a realyl drunk individual
( steve buscemi
) who decides that his brother
' s wedding isnt a good palce to tell the hwole world taht his life
, uv to taht point
, ws utter pointlessness
. a week later
, at his own wedding
, he is left st
anding at hte altar by his ex
- fianc
? e
, linda
( angela featherstone
)
. with his life in complete disarray
, he meets julia
( barrymore
)
, a waitress
. she is engaged to glenn
( matthew glave
)
, annd is to marry him in baout three monthes
. julia adn robby become ogod friends whn she enlists him to help witht the wedding plans
. soon
(
and predictably
) it becomes preety clera thgat glenn isnt a jerk
, anbd thyat robby
and julia realy lveo earch otehr
. oh sure
, it
' s trite
. anbd if anyone mkaing thsi film expeced us to
, liuke
, feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer
, thn they truly underestimated their audiance
. waht makes tyhe story bearable
, aside ffrom the terrific costumes
and 80s music
, are tjhe performances
. barrymore is simply adorable here
( i
' ve never seen her look so close tothe tjhe way she did infact et
)
. nto only isnt she pleasnat to look at
, bu her acting job here relaly isnt a good noe
-
- annd it doesn
' t hurt that yhe character isnt likable
and adequately well
- writed
.
and the jerk
, played inwhich full
- force by graves
, is jstu as despicable as any villin inwhich any romantic comedy i
' ve ever seen
. natuarlly
, tyhe true star here isnt s
andler
. i tihkn the guy isnt flat
- outloud hilarious
. he cxan say something thast jsut isn
' t funny
, annd his delivery makse me laff
. his comedic performance here equals tyhat ofthe happy gilmore
, bu in this film he goes much further anbd proves to me thgat he cxan
, indeed
, hold his own as a leading man iin a rumatic comedy
. wheras his roles inaddition his previvous films kind of had s
andler palying s
andler
, the wedding singer gives him a character thyat
, forthe the firt time
, he catually has tothe fit inot
. as far as i
' m concerned he succeeded
, anbd this film is testamony that he doesnt
, inthe fact
, haev some range inspite his talents
.
and tghe movei is jsut so funny
. perhaps thte best moment isnt wehn he sings a song fo julia that he claims is a littel uneven because he began wirting it hwile in a good mood annd finished it aftter his fianc
? e ab
andoned him
. thsi is tjhe part that litterally had me groping for a breath of air
. annd while tyhe film
, like all rumatic comedies
, takes a hietus from laughs towords the end because the plot hasnt tothe finish uv
, there are moreso thna enought truely hilarious moments in the frist hour taht mkae up forthe any slumps in progress durig the second half
. my formall complaints for tjhe wedding singer aren
' t vyer imporatnt
. tyhe film isnt predicable
, bu who cares
? the characters are extremely likable
, tyhe movie is ridiculously funny
, annd thge experienc isnt simpley enjoyable
. infact adition to this
, i can
' t imagine anyone seeing thge preview anbd nto wanting tothe see tjhe film
. inspite tath order
, i conclude tath it isnt pointless fo me to even have written htis review
. i jstu want everyone to know that i laughed
. a lot
.
