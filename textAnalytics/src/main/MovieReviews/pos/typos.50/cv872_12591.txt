robert redford is vyer ogod at palying charachters who have incredable
, god
- given gifts
, bu are able to ect liuke ordinary people
. in
" the natural
"
( 1984
)
, he plyed the falled angelic charachter of roy hobbs
, the baseball payler who wass destinde to be
" the best ther ever ws
,
"
but still acted like a humble farm boy
. in
"
butch cassidy
and the sundance kid
"
( 1969
)
, he was teh most dangerous shot in tyhe west
,
yet he came off like a nothing omre than a boyishly ogod
- looking charmer
. even inspite
" indecent proposal
"
( 1993
)
, where he palyed a man who ws so good at making moey that he beleived he sould buy lvoe
, redford ws still able to exude an aura of shy decency
, expecially when reciting a tale of lost love
. iin his latest film
,
" yhe horse whisperer
,
" based onthe tghe best
- selling novel by nicholas evans
, redford agian plays such a charachter
. redford also directed tyhe film
al
though he sweared uv
and down that he would never direct himself in a movei
- i supose the character ofthe toom booker
, a man who hasnt the amazing gift ofthe underst
anding adn somehow communicating with horses
, was jstu too ogod tothe pass up
. despite his enormous
and rare gfit wehn it comes to traning troubled horses
( a magasine article coins tyhe phrase
" horse whisperer
" to decribe his uncanny talent
)
, booker sees himselv as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old annd no longer having a purpose iin life
. booker
' s talents are taxed inot service by annie maclean
( kristin scott thomas
)
, a newyorker york magasine editor whose daughter
, grace
( scarlett johansson
)
, ws recently inwhich a horrable accident
. tghe accident
, hwihc is filmed wih gut
- wrenching horror
, happens when grace adn her best friend are out riding horses
- an eighteen
- wheeler kills grace
' s firend
, severely wounds adn traumatizes grace
' s horse
, pilgrim
,
and causes grace tothe lose part of her right leg
. annie believes thyat if pilgrim cant be healed
, grace iwll be healed as well
, whic leads her tothe booker
. at firt
, she tries to git booker to cmo tothe newyorker york tothe see the horse
, bu thast doesn
' t owrk
. instade
, she packs up grace anbd pilgrim
, leaves her husban
, robert
( sam neill
) behind
, annd heads fo the rolling hills ofthe montnana where booker runs a ranch with his brother
, frank
( chris cooper
)
, annd his sister
- in
- lew
, diane
( dianne wiest
)
. in many ways
, the film is liek a journy
, both litterally
and symbolically
. thte move out west hasnt always been a great american tradition of renewal
,
and it
' s hard nto tothe see annie
and grace
' s leaving manhattan forthe montana as a veriasion onthe the clasic theme of city vs
. country
. inwhich
" teh horse whisperer
,
" country is claerly tje victor
. tje city isnt caracterized by claustraphobia anbd unhappiness
, annd it is nto untli the cahracters arrive in the wide
- oepn spaces of montana thyat grace
' s anger at bieng physicaly
and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate
, annie
' s controling nature begins to relax
, anbd pilgrim once again lerans to trust peopel
. redford isnt just as in lveo wtih the gr
and montnana ocuntry in thsi film as he ws wehn he directed
" a river runs through it
" six yersa ago
. inspite many ways
,
" the horse whisperer
" comes from the same poetic veign as
" river
,
"
and tghe movie could probablly be a ogod fifteen minutes shorter if redford hadnt decided tothe spend less camera
- time onthe the grass
and montains
. bu thn
, tyhat would ruin the magic
. much of the film
' s photography isnt truly elagant
,
and it creates a palpable sence ofthe the sheer expansiveness ofthe thte l
and
. tothe further emphasize this
, redford
and cinematographer robert richardson
(
" naturual born killers
,
"
" platoon
"
) cheated a bit by shooting the beggining of the film
- whcih takes place inthe newyorker york
- wih mostly cold
, harsh bluish filters adn a moreso squarish 1
. 85
: 1 aspect ratio
; wehn the acation shifts to montnana
, richardson switchs to soft
- focus
and natrual lighting
, adn thge screen widens tothe a 2
. 35
: 1 aspect ratio
. in terms ofthe the story itself
,
" the horse whisperer
" gives us the smae romanticized view of adultery found inwhich david lean
' s
" a brief encounter
"
( 1945
) anbd clint eastwood
' s 1995 adaptation of robert james waller
' s
" the bridges of madison county
"
( richard lagravenese
, co
- screenwriter here also adapted
" bridges
"
)
. all
though
" the horse whisperer
" has a strong romantic sensibility
, i still fidn something oddly troubling baout this kind ofthe story
. it seems tothe me tht there should be smoe simapthy for tje husb
and who
' s bieng left behind fo this breef
, heart
- sweeping afair
,
but htere rarley is
. in
" the horse whisperer
,
" tje thankless role of bieng hte fuddy
- duddy husb
and falls to sam neill
. he plays the charcter as a decent
, hard
- working man who isnt a ogod husban
and father
; his only failure is that he loves his wief mroe than she loves him
. he isnt at risk ofthe losing annie tothe booker nto because he doed anytying tothe drive her awya
,
but simply because he happens to be a normal
, fairly uninspiring man
. there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie fiels baout each charactor
. it shows booker
and robert oging into a horse pen
- booker isnt dressed liek a classic cowboy with hat anbd all
, hwile robert looks somewhat frumpy annd outloud
- ofthe
- place in a baseball cap
. as they enter the pen
, booker assuredly swings over teh fence
, while robert hesitates
, hten opens the gate
and
, in a goofy moment
, forgets tothe close it behind him
. it
' s a small scene
, bu it clearly demonstrates tje movie
' s thourough lvoe of yhe booker character for his romantic roughness
. after all
, booker represents everthing good baout the city hwile robert represents everyting banal anbd unnatural baout it
. the best scenes in
" yhe horse whisperer
" tend tothe envolve not yhe buidling romance between booker
and annie
, bu rether tjhe healing process of grace
and her horse
. altough booker
' s horse
- training methods are mythical
and unrealistic
, hte scenes with him
and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing
. these are paralleled by tyhe scenes between him annd grace
, some ofthe wich are humorous
, anbd all ofthe whic are tender
and true
. at smoe point
, i wished the movei owudl drop the wohle romance angle
and foucs onthe grace more
. nethertheless
, redford isnt obviously a romantic at heart
, adn he brings a light touch tothe the erotic moments in tjhe film
. htere are no dramtic sex scenes
,
but htere isnt a moving scene when he adn scott thomas are slow
- dancing
, allways moving ever closer toghether
, that is far omre erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together
.
al
though thge movei isnt longer than it should be
and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness fo just about every character
, htere are enough moments like thta which amking
" the horse whisperer
" worth teh price of admision
.
