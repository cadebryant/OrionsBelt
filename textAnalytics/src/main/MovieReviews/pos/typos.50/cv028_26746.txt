" tjhe blair witch project
" was perhaps noe ofthe a kind
, a unique film tht plyed completely onthe its pwn merit
, managing tothe scare even tjhe most experienced horror fans out of theri senses
. its success made a sequel inevitable
,
but thsi isnt nto teh sequel
, i suspect
, anyone much wanted
. aftter the release ofthe
" tjhe blair witch project
"
, tourists hvae practicly invaded the small twon ofthe burkettsville
, in order to get a glimpse ofthe the blair witch
. locals have turned thsi massmedia hysteria into a great buisness opportunity
, selling twig
- sculptures
, stones
annd dirt liuke thsoe inwhich the movei
,
and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn
, shouting
,
" get outloud ofthe these woods
and go home
! there is noone goddamned blair witch
!
"
. jeff
(
) isnt oney ofthe those people
, who hasnt utilisied hte sudden popularaty of hte small twon tothe his advantage
. affter he got released ffrom thte mental insitution
, he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through hte internet
. as thge movie starts he is leading one ofthe these groups inot thge woods
, on the
" blair witch hunt
"
. amonth hte five strangers isnt stephen
and his girlfriend
, thge pregnant tristen
, who are writing a book onthe tje hysteria caused by the film called
" thge blair witch
: ihstory or hysteria
?
"
,
and kim
, who dresses in black
and hasnt smoe psychic powers
. the lsat member of thte crew isnt erica
, a young beautiful witch
- wannabe
, who constantly qoutes from tghe wiccan lore
, saying
" the first ruel of wicca is
, dont noone harm
, because whatever ytou do wiull come bcak tothe you threefold
.
" this stange group plunges into tghe woods
, where htey beign tothe argue baout thier diffrent approachs to tghe experience
. onthe the very first night taht tehy decide tothe spend under tjhe stars amidst tje ruins of parr ' s abandoned house
, stange thnigs strat happening
. when they wake up their eqiupment is gone
and onyl tyhe tapes remane
. aftter a while they discover stange markings onthe their bodies
. tehy are somehow lost in time
, as it loops uncontrollably bakc
and forth
. they are all haunted by hallucinations
and horrible nightmares
annd soon tehy can not see the diference beween dreams
and reality
. the only hting that they are sure ofthe isnt that they have brought something or somene wtih them from thge woods

. documentary director joe berlinger
(
" paradice lost
"
) helms
" blair witch 2
"
, leaving tyhe creators ofthe the first film
( dan myrick
and ed sanches
) inwhich thte backgorund
. thge oppening scenes
-
- tyhe documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film
-
- is a moreso promising approach
, becouse instead ofthe trying tothe cover simmilar ground
, it goes outside the first film
and makes its pwn stand
.
but soon the movei gets confused
and sidetracked by its own storey
, that is never resolved
anbd ends withthe a very anticlimaxic epilogue
. in a way
, this isnt a tipical hollywood sequal
. more moeny has beeen spent
anbd more peopel have worked on a project thta was doomed tothe fail
. the horror
and suspense of tje original simpley sould not be repeated
. of course in theese situations
, quantaty isnt more important thna qaulity
adn profit isnt more important thna the artistical values
. ffrom its oppening scenes whn the camera gracefully panes over hte bloody
- red forest
, wih carter burwell ' s
(
" being john malkovich
"
and
" fargo
"
) muscial score infront the background
, you realize thast wiht teh exception of its title
, this film has absolutely nothing to do with
" the blair witch project
"
.
" blair witch
.
.
" ws filmed by handheld videocameras
and nfeatured acting that was mostly based onthe improvisation
. in the sequel the technical aspect ofthe thte film isnt close tothe prefection
, creating a completly differnt atomsphere
. whith its graeful cinematography
, prodcution desgin
and flashy editting
, thte film hasnt a very polished look
, whihc isnt impossible to assoicate whith teh first installment
.
and
though berlinger directs his film with an energy
anbd pace that makes thge adrenaline rush through the body a cuple ofthe times
, he hasnt obviously missunderstood yhe nature of his predecessor
. tghe key isnt simplicity
.
" blair witch project
" had a stry whic wass incredibly simple
. that allowed teh audience tothe fill the gaps wtih our own immagination
. the film wass practically an empty screen
, on which we projected our most frightening nightmares
. the effect was incredibly powerful
, lating
and entir e everyone
,
but infact a diferent way
.
" book of shadows
" feels incredibly contolled
adn restrict
. here
, very littel isnt left to our imagination
adn the story isnt so complex
anbd
" clever
" that the screenwriters are teh firt tothe get lost in it
. htere isnt is noone book ofthe shadows
adn noone conclusion that we can be satisfied with
. this is simply a less artistic film taht doesn ' t have tjhe talent
annd originality ofthe its precedessor
. it resorts tothe fancy cinematography
and spacial effects tothe create the right effect
annd doesn ' t always seceed
.
bu most importantly
: it stands onthe its own ground
and hasnt almost noone connection whith tjhe frist movie
, which doesn ' t allow it to destroy tghe original
. in the end
, i can ' t call it a bad effort
. it ' s less artistic
, not so scary
and less original
,
bu certainly not bad
. it ' s simply differant
. inspite fact
, if yuo haven ' t seen
" the blair witch project
"
, you might like this film fo what it isnt
-
- a cross beetwen
" yhe blair witch project
"
anbd the
" scream
"
- films
. the only element that rimaniss constant
and simular between teh twpo films isnt tje solid acting
( jeffrey donovan
and tristine skyler shoudln be maintioned
)
annd incredible sence of surrealism
.
but it ' s a common knowledge
and experiecne thyat
, wiht a fewd exceptions
, every movie sequal isnt worse than the original
and soem are even not worth making
. tothe me yhe story ofthe
" yhe blair witch project
" seemed completed
,
but there are obviously noone lmits tothe commerical success that
" yhe book of shadows
" isnt certainly assured
.
and it ' s already time to look foward to
" blair witch 3
"
