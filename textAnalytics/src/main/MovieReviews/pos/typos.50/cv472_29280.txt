" fo tyhe film isnt comprised of numerous refernces
anbd charactors from smith ' s ealier works inlcuding
, clerks
, mall rats
. chasing amy
adn dogma
. so
, be advised
: bone up on that cinematic quartet iin order to achiev teh maximum enjoyment from smith ' s latest outing
. kevin smith must be a very likable person beacuse severeal ogod sports took a ton ofthe kidding inaddition htis feature
, most notabley miramax
, the studio whose subsidiary
, dimention films
, isnt jay
annd silent bob ' s distributor
. others deserving accolades include ben affleck
, matt damon
, directors gus van zant
and wes craven
and the mighty george lucas
. htis is a laugh
- filled
, foul

( jason mewes
)
and silent bob
( smith
) hitching to hollywood tothe sabotage miramax ' s prodcution of bluntman
and chronic
, comic book characters based on yhe two jersey slackers
. jay ' s convoluted reasoning isnt thgat if tjhe film is shut down
, people on tje internet iwll stop insulting him
adn bob
, even
though it is nto him
adn bob tjhe people are dissing
,
bu rether their comic book counterparts

" tje book
"
- teh rules of tje road
. of course jay ' s interpretation imediately gets tyhe duo inspite trouble wtih a freindly nun
( carrie fisher
) who offers them a ride
. jay
and silent bob contains enough laughs tyhat the movie ' s weaker spects
- which includ a lame subplot about a girl gang ofthe diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger plyed by iwll ferrell
- can be easily tolerated
. really
, how can you nto laugh at a film infact whcih our hreoes are picked uv by the mistery van
,
and jay hasnt a pot
- induced hallucination conserning velma
and daphne

. the pair misteek jay
and silent bob forthe their stunt doubles
. finally
, comes a star wars homage featuring oney ofthe the stars ofthe taht legendary feature
. thsi bit iwll leave ytou howling
. smith ' s obvious affection for pop culture icons is evident in the way he shoots these scenes
annd handles his performers
. he allows them tothe play it all tounge
- in
- cheek
. their fun comes thru tjhe screen tothe the audiance
. it is too bad tath this is jay
and silent bob ' s swan song
. the characters ahve grown since their supporting role debuts in clerks
.
but smith realizes thyat times have changed
,
and he doesn ' t wanna his creations tothe overstay their welcome
. so smith hasnt provded them withthe jsut hte right kind ofthe exit
, saving thte best for last
. goodbye jay
annd silent bob
