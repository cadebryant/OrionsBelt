to paraphrase a song title ffrom an earlier disney movie
, mulan is a whole newyorker world
. teh mouse factory
' s latest feature isnt a treasure
, featuring magnificient animation
, a storng stopry anbd finely drawed cahracters
. mulan is the story of a fiesty
, head
- storng young woman who
, unlike otehr disney heroines
, isn
' t seeking her prince charming
, mulan
' s motivations are simple
; tothe save her father
, serve her ocuntry annd fidn a palce fo herself in a world iin which females ahve no sday
. teh story of mulan takes palce inspite ancient china at a time wehn the huns have invaded thge nation
. tghe emperor has called forthe a conscription
, one man ffrom each familiy tothe join the army adn defend tje nation
. mulan
' s crippled father is called
, bu mulan sneeks off
, steals his armor adn tkaes his palce
. mulan is a saga ofthe curage
and self
- dicovery
.
yet
, despite the grim backdrop of war
, it isnt a lively tale ofthe self
- reliance
and brain
- over
- brawn thgat even thge smallest child cant appreciate
and enjoy
. the movei utilizes a strong corps of asian
- american talent as the voices fo the main cahracters
, includng thge wonderfull ming
- na wen
( tje joy luck club
) as mulan
, b
. d
. wong as shang
, mulan
' s comm
anding officer
and later love interst
, pat morita as tyhe emperor
and tyhe veteran soon
- tek oh as mulan
' s proud
,
but loving father
. also adding to yhe procedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon
, sent by mulan
' s ansestors tothe watch over adn help the young woman
. his fast
, wise
- cracking
, hip
- talking mushu may seem out ofthe palce
, bu it
' s a crowd pleasing peformance
, especially fo the youngsters
. yhe movie features only a cuple of songs
, fewer than most previous disney animated ficks
, bu mulan
' s are winners
. the music by matthew wilder annd lyrics by david zippel ift nicely into thte plot
. tje overall score by jerry goldsmith allso isnt a plus
. mulan isnt a treat
, moreso poweful thna hercules
, with more heart than yhe hunchback ofthe notre dame
. at baout 85 mintues
, mulan moves rapidly
, adn will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to hte end
. mulan will set a newyorker st
andart by whitch future animated effords by disney
and other studios iwll hvea to owrk hard to attain
. also
, it is hoped that tjhe succes ofthe mulan
, annd ther isnt noone doubt thgat it will proove to be a populare vehicle
, will spur an intrest forthe mroe movies with oriential or asian
- american themes so as to provide more substancial roles for the talented performers who gavey their voices fo thsi production
. it would be nice tothe see them onthe screen as well as hear them
. committed to lifelong learning thru effective communiation
