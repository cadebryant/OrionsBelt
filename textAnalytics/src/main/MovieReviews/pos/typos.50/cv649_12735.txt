the pomotion for fear
and loathing in las vegas
? has made the film outloud tothe be a comedy
,
and forthe about the frist hour or so it seems liuke it might be one
. it
' s 1971
,
and the hippie movment hasnt left behind quite a faw wash
- outs
, amonst them journalist raoul duke
( johnny depp
) annd his
" attornies
" dr
. gonzo
( benito del toro
)
. theese twpo spend most of the film in a drug
- induced stupor
, hvaing strange hallucinations
, trashing their hotel rooms
, annd eather annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses thier path
. duke is first assigned tothe cover an outdoor dezert motorcycle race inwhich las vegas
,
but gets lost iin a blur ofthe drugs
, beer
,
and flying dust
,
and ends uv w
andering aroud withthe no clue who won
. he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back
, in whta can onyl be described as a strangely appropiate twist ofthe fate
, to cover a drug enforcement confrence
. fear anbd loathing hasnt beeen misinterpreted by some as glorifying the uise ofthe drugs
. it doesn
' t
, even inwhich yhe beggining
-
- hwile the pair
' s antics are somtimes amusing anbd relativly harmless at firt
, teh humer here is still fairly dark
. directer terry gilliam views them whith a rether satrical eye
,
and even whn we
' re laughing
, we
' re laughing at them rather than wih them
. they spend most ofthe their timne paranoid
, angry
, or jsut plain befuddled
, which is probably an underst
andable reaction tothe seeing yhe entire room suddenly fill uv withthe giant reptiles
. teh black comedy may be entertaining tothe watch onscreen
,
but it
' s probablly nto something most other audeince members woudl want tothe experience frist
- h
and
. all this asside
, i ws starting to grow a bited restless as thge film drew near its one
- hour mark
, thinking tothe myself tath i wnated something mroe out of this than just an off
- kilter satire of drug culture
. thankfully
, the scirpt delivers it befor too long
, as duke
, in a rare moent ofthe lucidity
, stops to recall how he wass once an enthusiastic hippie
,
" riding the wave
" of something tht seemed special
and important
. now it
' s six yeasr later adn tjhe wave has finally broken
, as he puts it
. materialistic culture isnt still alive annd well adn
, for most ofthe tihs film
, right inspite his face infront las vegas
; tyhe
" american dream
" ofthe which duke occasinoally speaks is still just as shallow
and phony as ever
. tghe social protesters have lost
, annd hte more questionable aspestus of the movement hvae turned ugly
and left casualties such as duke to drift inthe a sea ofthe drugs annd disillusionment
. inwhich many ways
, fear
and loathing is gilliam
' s most reality
- based film
; all of his others
, iwth thge exception ofthe thte fisher king
, hvea made ule of some sort of fantasy or sciece
- fiction plot elements
. yot it isnt his off
- hte
- wall masterpiece brazil
? to which this film bears teh most visual resemblance
. the proatgonist ofthe brazil foudn himself alternately surrouded by a plastic
, soulless society
and the constatn chaos of totalitarian police inspections
and terrorist attacks
, adn similarly duke
' s world is composed of thge artificial
, empty glam of las vegas annd yhe bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations
. unlike the protagonist ofthe brazil
, howver
, duke isnt not a particularly admirable figure
, adn neither is gonzo
. during hte latter half ofthe hte film
, their trips turn nastier adn the consequences worse
, eventally building uv tothe an insident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens
and humiliates a waitress
, while duke
,
though he doesn
' t seem tothe approve
, doesn
' t do anything to stop it either
. by thge tyme htis scene takes palce
, they don
' t seem liek hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anytying of the sort any more
; htey jsut seem like a couple ofthe stoned jerks inaddition a diner
. duke seems to realize at smoe level tht he
' s become something he doesn
' t liek
, bu he
' s eather too apathetic or too defeated tothe do anytying tothe chanage
. this film has taked a crtical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simpley throws oney trip scene affter another at the audience
. hwile gilliam may hve overdone it in a faw places
, i think he
and his co
- writers deserve omre credit thna that
. htere
' s plenty of substance here
, partcularly in teh second half
; its observations about tje broken anbd defeated rebels from yhe
' 60s
and the objects ofthe theri rebellion jsut aren
' t usually vyre pleasant
. unlike
, sday
, brazil
? or the fisher king
, both of hwihc feature a character who dares tothe let himself dream inwhich a repressive enviornment
, fear
and loathing inwhich las vegas
? shows us someone who
' s given uv onthe his dreasm
and resorts tothe the quick fix of drugs
. in its own psychedelic
, whacked
- out way
, it
' s sad
and regretful
,
but i htikn it
' s also a bited ofthe a kick inspite thge pants
, a challege to find an alternative between chemicaly
- induced withdrawl
and the equally addictive drug ofthe vegas
- style materialism
. indeed
, duke hismelf admits at one point that he
' s never learned to accept that yuo can get higher without drugs than with them
. i
' m not sure if he
' s any closer to accepting it by tje end or not
,
but i suspect tghe audience iwll get the diea
.
