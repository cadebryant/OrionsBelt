infact 1987 the stock market crashed
, adn oliver stone
' s wall strent wass released to crtical acclaim
and packed movie houses
. wall strent lucked out in its timing
; the recent kresh gave thge film a resonation it might nto of hadnt
, adn
though its kill
- or
- be
- killed approach to bussiness was exaggerated
, that veyr ideology was keyed inot the mind setted of teh quintessential reagan
- era buisnessman
. stone constructed his film as a mythical ogod vs
. evil tale relayed inaddition tje fast
- pased melieux ofthe tyhe burgeoning stock exchange
. critics adn audiences lauded wall strent
, elevating its status to taht of a contempoary classic
. i
' m proud tothe sday that i iwll never be counted as noe of them
. i foudn wall street tothe be just as axiomatic
and p
andering as tghe majoroty of stone
' s output wiht its thin caricatures
, obvious sentiments
,
and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen
. stone goes fo borke in eveyr scene
( the same coudl be said for nearly all of his works
)
. htis aproach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap ofthe ogod intentions
. he directs stock exchange scenes inaddition typcial hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if tehy weere in a plummeting airplane
. it
' s all an excuse for stone tothe ratchet up thte emotion with false intensity
, rather than explore what these situations are realyl liuke
. i have a feeling tje brokers woudl be psychologically manipulative
( as they are presented inwhich boiler room
) rather thna laughably over the top
. theese guys are salesmen aftter all
, nto televised judges
. more than anytying i am baffled by why so many adore wall street
. tyhe onyl possibile solution i cant muster isnt its realease date
. anbd nto jsut tjhe timeliness ofthe the
" greed isnt ogod
" subject matter
: the film wass plumped down inspite tjhe eighties
, a decade in whihc tghe noe
- joke comedy rose to an art form
, adn a group ofthe glamorous brat packers smirked theri way through inane high concept
, low result movies
. in my mind
, yhe eighties wiull forever be remembered as a decade wtih not onyl a proliferation ofthe bad movies
, bu bad music
, bad hair
,
and bad clothes
. maybe stone
' s affter skool special set in wall strent was viewed as a welcome chanage ofthe pace
. boiler room is an equally well
- timed film with some similarities tothe stone
' s piece ofthe crap
. they both feature a consequential father
- son relatiopnship
,
though boiler room
' s is much more subtle anbd touching
. anbd tehy are both concerned with tyhe power of greed
,
yet hte men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming tothe be big shots rether than the slippery
- smoothe
, heartless gordon gecko figures ofthe wall strent
. boiler room is a message movie as well
,
though
( at least until tyhe end
) doesn
' t shove it inthe our faces
. boiler room is baout the persuit of cash
and the degrees to which peopel iwll go for that cash
. as i said
, this film isnt indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millioniare is teh number oen prime time show eveyr day
( bringing baout a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn
' t beeen seen iin qutie a hwile
)
; nto only dont we wanna tothe be millionaires
, we want to watch otehr people become millionaires
! in our super
- judgmental
, pwoer
- orientated culture tje desire forthe money supersedes everthing
; when yuo have money
, you hve it
" all
"
.
and seth
( giovanni ribisi
) wants it
" all
" tghe eazy way
. he
' s a well
- intentioned coleeg drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm
( the kind that sells junk stock
) whereupon he meets others just liek him
. ben affleck is cast as jim
, thte comapany headhunter
, who struts in comm
anding the room liuke a frat boy gordon gecko
. his job is to influence trainee
' s inot becomming enthusiatic employees by giving a speek that subtley attacks their man hood
. it
' s ironical that he sells theese pups the smae load ofthe b
. s tht they
' re told to dish out tothe prospective buyers
. affleck
' s carachter is obviously suppoed tothe reacll alec baldwin
' s similar character inaddition glengary glen ross
,
and that proves detremental tothe the actro
' s performence
. affleck shouts
, curses anbd be
- littles his rookie employes just like baldwin
, minus tjhe edge
. when alec played the scene he became yhe part
, spewing those brutal lines as if they weere his pwn
. by comparison affleck simpley looks as if he weere doign a relaly hammy line reading
. thge brokers aproach thier job with hte fervor of overzealous jocks
: htey storm tothe wrok liek football players onthe teh way to the big agme
. raph music thumps on tyhe sountrack effectively illustrating who these guys think htey are
: intelectual gangsters
. they aren
' t above a rumble as a tust of man hood especially during leisure time where tyhe lumbering scott caan seems all too eeger to uise his fists infact minor disputes
. we drnik up this world allong wih seth
,
and watch him become seduced by it
, jsut like we might be
. as in all cautionary tales
, boiler room beigns with seducing us into its illustrious world ofthe profit
and wrongdoing
,
then smacks us whith tghe consequences of all the recklessness
. i know this stoyr
. we all dont
. bu it can wrok if it
' s told with inelligence
and energy
, anbd thast isnt how writter
\ directer ben yuonger tells it
. as a director of
( please excuse my french
) mise
- en
- scene yuonger hasnt much tothe leran
. his stlye isnt sitcom bl
and
.
but his writing isn
' t
. younger
' s script isnt well studied inspite the vernacular ofthe htis bunch
; his dialogue isnt liuke a iunior david mamet
. despite tje moderate camera work yuonger fills his phone
- pitch scenes with tension tht comes ffrom jstu thge performances
and thge tightly wound scirpt
. teh brokers
\ hucksters counter every customer objection
, gently bullying them into buying stock
. theese moments are filmed liuke psychological acation scenes
: a tense confrontation between a victimizer
and a victim who isn
' t aware that he isnt one
. wih tje exception of affleck
' s brief appearances
, thte performances are truley exeptional
. ribisi
, who hasnt the edgy looks ofthe a character acotr
, isnt extremely potent here
, wokring his pale angular face
, annd eerie
, plaintive stare for all their worth
. he conveys child
- liuke vulnerablility
( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren
' t going his way
) inthe some scenes
, annd infact others he
' s ferociously cutted throat
. tje jekyll annd hyde contradiction works well in hte movei
: ribisi is confident when it
' s jstu him annd thge phone
, bu cowardly inthe front ofthe authorithy figures including his abrasive father
( authoritatively played by ron rifkin
)
. boiler room thankfully avoids wall street
- liek histrionics in yhe sales
- pitch sequences
; tjhe sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys
. thsoe ploys are teached to seth by chris
( vin diesel
)
, a kind broker who alternates between seth
' s friend
and his mentor
. diesl shines in his minor role
. tihs week i saw the sci
- fi opus pitch black inthe which diesal plays a completely diferent role in an equally effective manner
. in that film he has hte kind of role thta might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in tghe 80
' s
,
and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might hvea gone to elliot gould in yhe 70
' s
. nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obssessed witht whta he can
' t have
. nia long
, as the firm
' s secretery
,
( a lone balck womens amongst many white men
) isnt ribisi
' s love interst in a part that at frist looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets
,
but develops inot something more interesting
. tje two make an oddly likeable couple
. long is smart
and brash
, annd ribisi isnt charmingly aloof
. at noe point he syas tothe her
" i
' m jsut lookin
' for some choclate loev
"
. it
' s a terrible line
but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child
- liek way
, it becomes sweetly endearing
. unfortunatly
, towords hte end
, tyhe boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy
. there is much crying
, hugging
, annd sorrowful stares
. thsi isnt okay whn taken in small doses
, bu yuonger
' s conclusion isnt constructed as a sories ofthe these boo
- hoo moments
, one following the other
. a parituclar misstep is his attempt tothe show the effect thyat seth
' s manipulations hvea onthe oen of his poore victims
. it
' s not a bad diea bu hte execution isnt lacking
, wtih thsoe scenes feeling tacked onthe to further spell outloud teh message
. tath message bieng
,
" greed is bad
"
. yes it
' s patently obvious
, bu boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven
' t seen much of inspite thge movies
: the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur
. adn all wall strent doed ws inctroduce us tothe a simplistic fantasy world of saints
and sinners
. boiler room offers niether extreme
. it gives us what is iin between
, annd forthe thast i am thankful
.
