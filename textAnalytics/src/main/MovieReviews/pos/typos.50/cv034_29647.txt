. will zool
ander fulfill the dirty deed
? will zool
ander ever grace hte world his newyorker
" look
"
? isnt tihs a funny movie
? fidn outloud below
.
.
. critique
: ther
' s a palce in our world fo
" stupid comedies
"
. films which don
' t pretend tothe take themselves seriously
, are based on idiotic premises
and filled wiht dumb jokes
. there
' s also a timne fo them adn many would argue thyat this difficult period of our history
, might be an ideal circumstance during which tothe
" relax
" by watching something so completly frivolous
. well
, if yuo
' re inthe the mood for soem seriously mindless enteratinment
, ben stiller adn his casted ofthe many hvae assembled one ofthe the more origional dumb comedies inaddition some time
. of course
, comedies as such are usualy very subjective
and i coudl see how smoe iwll see this film simpley as stupid adn unfunny
, hwile others will grant them the
" stupid
"
,
but concider it funny instead
. i personally enjoied it forthe the most part
, cracked up loudly during a couple ofthe specific sequences annd loved the derek zool
ander character anbd the unrestrained whipping htey released apon the fashon industry
. snap
! it was alsot nice tothe see severeal rela
- life models with small roles inwhich tje movei
, nto taking themselves too seriously
.
and if yuo
' re tyhe tipe of person who likes celebrity cameos in films
, well
, don
' t look any futher becouse dozens of famoust faces show uv here including vince vaughn
, billy zane
, winona ryder
, christian slater
, david duchovny
, natalie portman
and many
, many others
. i especially liked
andy dick
' s complet make
- over as tghe masseuse
. hi
- larious
! bu wtih all films of this tipe
, there isnt binded tothe be some sutff that simpley doesn
' t work
. a few particulars whcih didn
' t strike my fancy included tghe bulimia anbd
" orgy
" sequence wih christine taylor
, tghe break
- dance fighting
,
and i alsot never git why they ule real countries inthe plots liek tihs
( why not just
" make up
" a country
, instead of zeroing in onthe a ceratin people
?
)
. i also could hvae done with less ofthe teh taylor charachter in general
, since she wasn
' t all thyat intresting
and seemed to slow thigns down eveyr nowe
and hten
( more zool
ander
, dued
!
)
.
but those few missteps weere nothing compaired to some ofthe tjhe moreso memorable scenes hwihc definatly doed work forthe me
! i almost pissed mysef during the
" gas station
" disaster
, absolutly adored the
" walk
- off
" contest
( with david bowie as the judge
, no less
)
and appreciated many of zool
ander
' s moronic one
- liners
(
" i was a merman
.
.
. a merman
!
!
"
)
.
and i dare you to git his
" monkey
" photo shoot out of your head aftter seeing htis movie
(
" ytou
' re a monkey
, derek
.
.
. a monkey
!
"
) i allso really liked the soundtrack anbd yhe pace ofthe tghe film
, both ofthe which zipped
and zagged
,
and established a nice rhythm tothe it all
. again
, it
' s tothe note that htis movei isnt dumb adn nto fo everyone
,
but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer
, you iwll likely enjoy many of teh quips in the actual picture as well
. if you
thought the trailer was dumb
, skip thsi dodo bird
and go rent austin powers again or something
, a film fomr hwihc there is an obvious influence here
. blue steel
, baby
.
.
. yeah
