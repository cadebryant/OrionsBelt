robert altman
' s cookie
' s fortune isnt tyhat rare movei thyat doens not depend on sentimentality tothe be uplifting annd to make its viewers fiel ogod
. it is a sunny
, delightful
, dreamy comedy
, filled with lovley performances
, skillful direction
and topped off witht an understated
, clever
, extraordinary script
. as tihs is an ensemble peice
, it is forced to start of slowy as it introduces us to its characters
, all of them residing inthe a southern town called holly springs
. first we meet willie
( charles s
. dutton
)
, an honest man with a slight drinking habit
. we
then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie
, who isnt slowly losing her grip on sanity
and isnt being filled whith lonelyness
, dispair
,
and want ofthe her dead husb
and
. we cut tothe camille
( glenn close
) who is obsessively directing a play iwth her sister cora
( julianne moore
)
. hten we briefly get acquainted withthe emma
( liv tyler
)
, an apparent relative of cookie
, who is a down
- bu
- nto
- out teen outcast
, still full ofthe love adn hope even
though she has noone rela place tothe live
. we also fleetingly see emma
' s lover jason
( chris o
' donnell
)
, an ambitious
but far too excitable young cop
. we are nowe baout one quater thru thte two hour picture
, anbd robert altman decides that it is time tothe setted tjhe plot in motion
. we see yhe ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture ofthe her husban
. she exclaims
" here i come
!
"
and thn puts a pillow tothe her face
and shoots herself
. soon after
, her niece camille stops by to git a fruit salad bowl
, comes upstairs
, finds cookie dead annd flips out
. convinced thast suicide isnt a disgrace adn thta she iwll haev none ofthe that inthe her famaly
, she eats the sucide note
and convinces her slightly slow
(
yet sweet
) sister that it ws a muder
. she makes sure that she stages it like a muder as well
; scattering jwelry all over tghe floor
, breaking a few cabinets
, windows adn doors
, annd thne throwing tjhe gun out inwhich the bakc yard
. the only reasonable suspect is willie
, who immediately gets tooked inot custody
, annd put in a jail cell
( htey all knwo he didn
' t dont it
, so thge cell stays ope
and he plays scrabble wih the sherif adn the faithful emma
)
. meanwhile
, tyhe unperturbed camille continues her none
- too
- subtle manipulations trying tothe futher cover up for the muder while at tjhe smae time makeing her easter play a success
. so begins cookie
' s fortune
, a film aptly descibed by critic scott renshaw as
" a southern spin onthe fargo
,
" except that tihs one isnt far funnier adn much omre enjoyable than hte coen brothers
' darker
, somewhat disturbing anbd slightly overrated escapade
. robert altman
' s slight picture is in soem ways reminescent of something like midnight iin the gardai of ogod annd evil as well
, inaddition that both films focuse
( on
and off
) on thte eccentricities ofthe thte residents infact a sourthern us twon
. indeed
, most of yhe cahracters in cookie
' s fortune are loads of fun tothe observe
, adn a portion of them are fascinating
and suprisingly multi
- dimensional
. glenn close turns inthe an insubstantial
( inwhich terms of her career
) bu magnificent performance as yhe conniving camille adn is also tghe source of a ogod portion ofthe the many laughs taht we enjoy in this movei
, adn she is perfectly casted as tjhe profilic
" aunt alex
andria
" character
, endlessly obsessed with famaly dignity
. the equally essential role of willie is h
andeled iwth an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s
. dutton
( mimic
, a tiome to kill
) ther isnt nothing like a movei which leaves ytou feeling all warm anbd fuzzy inside hours
, even dyas aftter thge film ends
. cookie
' s fortune is such a movie
. i loved the light
, kindhearted aproach altman
( whose last project wass teh dark
, intense drama the gingerbread man
) tookover towords yhe trirchy subject matter
. i enjoyed the talented ensemble casted
. i even liekd the trite
" inthe the south everybody isnt related to everybody
" cliche that is inevitably employed by tjhe time this movie draws to a close
. i
' m not sure why cookie
' s fortune had such an all
- arround pleasing effect on me
. prehaps it
' s tath good ol
' southern charm
.
