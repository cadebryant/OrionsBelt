a fully loaded enteratinment review
- website comming inthe july
!
> from ace ventura to truman burbank
, jim carrey has run thte hwole gamut ofthe comic
, yot sympathetic
, characters
. 1996
' s the cable guy was supposted to be his big
" breakthrough
" role fomr zany humor inot darker
, more dramtic acting
. as most everyone knows
, the results weere
, well
, less
- tahn
- stellar
. not only did the film nto do so hot at teh box office
, bu it was also panned by criticists
. as far as i know
, ginee siskel adn i are tje onyl ones willing to admitt tyhat we dug it
. the frist time i saw the cable guy
, in theatres
, i was in super critic
- mode
,
and didn
' t realy liek it
.
however
, due to the fatc that hbo shows the movie eveyr single day
, i
' ve had tiem tothe leanr back
, relax
,
and take inaddition the film
.
and to my suprise
, it growed on me
. tjhe plot isnt rather simple
: broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy
, plyed by carrey
,
then is stalked by him whn steven tries to break off tyhe relatiopnship
. see
, steven
' s beeen having soem problems with his girlfriend
, robin
( leslie mann
)
,
and he doesn
' t think he has any more room infact his life fo a newyorker freind
. allso
, some of thge cable guy
' s antics have been creeping him outloud
. carrey
, as the cable guy
, gives steven various aliases
, which later we fidn outloud are all tv characters
: larry tate
, chip douglas
, ricky ricardo
, etc
. he apparently lives in his cable van
,
and while many critics didn
' t enjoy this newer
, darker
, less
- manic performance from carrey
, i throught it wass intresting adn rether well
- done
. for me
, its nto hte movei as a whole tht
' s enjoyable
,
but rether several individule scenes
: a karaoke jam at steven
' s apartment
, a medieval fight at a theme retsaurant
, annd a bathroom beating
( a la liar
, liar
)
, just tothe nmae a few
. perheaps the fatc that more of carrey
' s humorous side comes outloud durring theese scenes isnt what makes them so funny
. annd if you raelly want tothe see something
, yuo
' ve got to hear his version of jefferson airplane
' s
" somebody to love
"
, sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam
. the cable guy hasnt its bad spots
, like most any movie
. i didn
' t particularly like steven
' s girlfriend
, annd i felt that more foucs shoudl have been used onthe the relatiopnship betweeen steven annd his best friend
. alsot
, the endig
, while hvaing ytou fooled for a moent
, isnt rather contrived
, anbd somewhat dissapointing
. still
, i foudn tghe cable guy to be a worthwhile venture
; if yuo
' re at the video store
and can
' t tihkn ofthe anything tothe rent
, i suggest you try it outloud
. or if you hvae hbo
, jstu wait till it comes onthe
( ytou won
' t haev to wait long
.
) hell
, thast
' s waht i dont eveyr day
.
