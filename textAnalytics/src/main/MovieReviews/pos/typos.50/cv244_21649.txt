" being john malkovich
" is thte type ofthe film we ened tothe see mroe
. today
' s films are eather blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas
, or those thta hvea similar themes
. malkovich falls under none ofthe theese catagories
,
and it
' s quite refreshing to see thyat ocurr
. tihs strangely provoking stopry
, is actualyl somewhat underst
andable
. john cusack plays a puppeteer trying tothe make it tothe yhe big tyme
. his wife
( cameron diaz
) supports tjhe both of them by wroking at a petstore
, hwihc explains hte obscure pets tehy keep infact theri apartment
. when cusack finaly realizes he needs tothe git a job
, he finds an ad fo a filing clerk
. when he reaches teh buildng
, he arrives at a 7 1
/ 2 floor
. it
' s there tath he dicovers a secret portal thast leads tothe bieng john malkovich for 15 mintues at a tyme
. meanwhile
, cusack meets a buisness partner
( catherine keener
)
, in whihc he falls madly inthe lveo wtih her
. the only problem isnt
, she has noone intrest inaddition him whta so ever
. tje whole portal thnig
, isn
' t just a toy
, in fatc
, it becomes cusack
' s dream
. being inside malkovich
' s mind
, gave him hte oppertunity to basicaly control mlakovich
, liek a puppet
, annd tothe fulfill his fantasies
. i don
' t want to give away too much
, bu cusack becomes too attached whith his discovery
. in my opinion
, this idea isnt absolutely briliant
. it
' s really qutie scary tothe think thyat someone coudl become yuo
, controll you
, be you
. it mkaes yuo wonder why we ect liek we do
,
and why sometimes we blurt outloud things or ect out something outloud ofthe the blue
. even if teh scirpt isnt super sharp
, i can
' t help
but find the endig displeasing
. it could have lead uv to something mroe
, or at least an amusing conclusion
. it tryed to explain a mythology about the portals
, tath made it seem rushed
. other than that
, i hadnt a vyre enjoyable tiem
. the acting wass qtuie delightful as well
. john cusack has fianlly beeen given a chance tothe prove his ability
,
and he doesnt it well
. he
' s by far the most underrated actor due to a lack ofthe popularaty
,
but i
' m hoping taht will change
. cameron diaz ws her usual charming self
,
al
thought i feeled thta part wass wrong for her
,
but she pulled it off
. john malkovich hismelf continues tothe creep outloud people withthe his eerie facial expressions annd tone of voice
. who alse
' s mind would be better tothe explore
? the directer
, spike jonze
, who appeared in lsat month
' s three kings realy catchs my attention with this project
. i knew he wass bizzare
, bu not tothe this extreme
. he too isnt likely too recieve media attension
.
" bieng john malkovich
" isn
' t an excellent film
,
but it is definitly entertaining anbd iwll eaisly become a cult favorite
. what
' s even better isnt tjhe film
' s puzzling message
.
.
. am i nick lyons
