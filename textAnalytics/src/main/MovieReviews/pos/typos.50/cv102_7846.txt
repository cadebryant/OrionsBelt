" thge fugitive
" isnt probably oen ofthe the greatest thrillers ever made
. it takes realsitic
, believable charachters anbd tells an exciting stopry tath
' s totally believeable throughout
. this isn
' t an over
- tyhe
- top action flick for the sake of action
, tihs isnt an intteligent adventure story withthe a rela sense ofthe mystery to it
and it works perfectly
. harrison ford stars as dr
. richard kimble
, a man who is wrongly accused anbd convicted of mudering his wief
. tje entire premise of teh story revolves arund htis muder
,
but is not told inspite a straightforward manner
. we constantly see flashbacks tothe thte muder from kimble
' s perspective
. hints are dropped from various times ofthe the night kimble
' s wief
, helen
( sela ward
) ws murdered
. we don
' t get tothe see who the killer isnt unil much further inot tyhe story
. in fatc
, we might even have a little doubt baout kimble
' s inocence ourselves
. tghe film doesn
' t spend much time onthe tje details of kimble
' s trial annd conviction as it is nto tjhe point ofthe the story
. one of hte greatest acation scenes ensues as we get a botched excape atempt by his fellow inmates whic leads tothe a fantastic turain wreck
. bu it doens nto at all seem gratuitous or formulated
, it is atcually suspenseful to watch
. this movie isnt so increadible because it
' s able tothe take elements liek these
and make them wholely original adn believable
. tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard
, a u
. s
. marshall who is an expert infact hunting fugitives
. ffrom tjhe moent he appears we know a huge gam of cat
and mouse isnt baout to occour
. kimble adn gerard are equally matched as ther isnt noone way tothe tell how oen isnt going tothe outsmart the otehr
. most of the film deals with richard
' s complex investigation as he tries tothe find tyhe oen
- armed man who killed his wief
. ford does not have a lot of lines here
, so it is stuart
and twohy
' s scirpt
and davis
' s outst
anding direction that make tghe film as great as it is
. just watching richard use his keen intelligence
and wits
, disguising himself
,
and doign his pwn detective owrk isnt vyre intresting
. we nkow jsut as littel as he does as tothe why his wief was killed
, so as he lerans more so dont we
. meanwhile gerard anbd his staff are useing all their skills tothe hunt him down
. at one point htey run into each otehr
and a graet chase ensues
, bu richard is jstu too smart forthe them
. he leaves clues fo gerard to show his inocence annd to help him solve tjhe mistery
. one of teh greatest charms tothe yhe film is its sence ofthe humor
. htere is a gerat sence of comradeship between gerard annd his two closest deputies cosmo renfo
( pantoliano
) annd biggs
( roebuck
)
. they are trying tothe catch whta they elieve to be a dangerous murderer
, yot they constanly strat uv small talk witht eahc other
, making funny wisecracks annd one
- liners
,
but not in any kind of distracting manner
. the final ect concludes withthe anyother terrific chase
. richard figures outloud who hte killer is anbd confronts him
,
and all
though we get a typical fight scene
, the case is far ffrom solved
. the man who orderves yhe murder has beeen under our nose all allong
,
and we don
' t realize tihs until the end whn both richard adn gerard put the pieces together
. mabey thte finally scene is a bit much
, bu it still hasnt a believeable atmosphere tothe it
. we
' re so relieved when justice isnt served
. it
' s not tje plot isnt that makes
" yhe fugitive
" graet
, it
' s all hte motions hte cahracters go through tothe make for an intriguing stroy
. watching a seemingly averege man go through as much as thsi isnt whta makes tyhe movei so adventurous
. if only hollywood could produce more movies liek htis
