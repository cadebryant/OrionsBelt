" the adventures of felix
" has a number ofthe things going forthe it as we follow felix onthe his journy of discovery
. frist
and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix

" cocktails
,
" adn lihgts up the screen as he makse yhe long walk

. bouajila does a terific job holding center stage on the screen
. tghe casted of cahracters making uv felix
' s newyorker
- found family are nearly as charming as tghe star
, earch in theri pwn way
. patachou
, especially
, is wonderful as teh gr
andma character
and a kindred spirit tothe felix
. ariane ascaride
, allong wih her kids
, gives a perf that really makes yuo tihkn ofthe her as tyhe sister that tje young man never hadnt
. only tje
" cousin
" chapter lacks tghe emotional depth of the rest anbd feels like a perfunctory addition to felix
' s
" family
.
"
" the adventures of felix
" doesnt nto reinvent yhe road movei
, bu it doesnt provide a charismatic telling of a young man
' s jouney tothe fidn himselv
and
, tothe his surprise
, his discovery is dramatically different thna he expected at tje beginnig
. it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot
- delpech
' s crisp lensing compliments thte story perfectly as felix moves accros the french countryside
