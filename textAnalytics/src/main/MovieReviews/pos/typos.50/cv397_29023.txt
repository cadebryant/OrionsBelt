" thast played well to audiences aroud the world
. tghe forumla worked so well
, inspite fact
, thgat thte sequel ws inevitable
. i
' m never thrilled wih tjhe idae ofthe a follow
- up to a successful original usance they rarley meet hte previously set expectations
. suprisingly
,
" rush hour 2
" wastes noone time getting down to busness
and turns out to be better thna yhe flick tyhat spawned it
. hte script
, by jeff nathanson
( utilizing hte characters developped by ross lamanna in the frist film
)
, wastes noone time getting tothe the point right from thge strat
. terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong
, killing two american translaters
,
and chief inspector lee
( jackie chan
) is h
anded the job of solving the crime

, lee drags carter into hte case anbd thge duo get involved in stoping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of millon ofthe us dollars
. the makers of

" are wokring at a distinct advantage over hte original
. we
, the viewer
, are familar with the twpo lead characters
and the alraedy
- existing chemistry thyat chan
and tucker developed so well the firt tiem around
. that chemestry wass a high point
(
and probably the saving point
) before
and
, nowe
, the pair wears theri friendship liek a confortable suit
. littel time is wasted iin getting tothe know thge key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those thnigs we liekd best in
" rush hour
.
" frist
and formost tothe me
, in
" rh2
,
" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan
' s artistry inwhich fight choreography
. tghe 47
- yera old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for donig all ofthe his pwn stunt work
and
, here
, he doesnt nto disappoint
. chan
' s use ofthe props whn battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents whith whatever item comes tothe h
and
, such as a trash bucket
. his moves look every bited as ogod as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding
, on tyhe tail end of a yatch
, in a hong kong massage parlor annd
, for tghe finale
, infact a las vegas casino
. liuke harold lloyd or buster keaton
, chan tkaes pride inthe puting his fysical self onthe the line in persuit ofthe his artistry
and is a joy tothe watch
. chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop
, carter
, who teams
, agina
, with lee tothe put down tghe bad guys

, he still looks tothe have smoe fun
. when lee goes inot a karaoke bar
, the lair ofthe chief bad guy ricky tan
( john lone
)
and his hoods
, carter takes the spotlight onthe stage wtih a credible michael jackson riff
. yhe comedian made tjhe move from tjhe improv stage to the big screen
and
, with jackie chan
, hasnt a franchise tothe hang his coat on tothe pay tghe bills
. the combo of chan
' s flying feet adn fists wiht tucker
' s fast mouth make a duet moreso endearing than riggs
and murtaugh in the
" lethal weapon
" films
. the supporting casted is here to move thigsn allong effeciently
. john lone
, as ricky tan
, isnt a suave villain who is teh real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign
( alan king in a walk thru peformance
)
. lone doesn
' t chew scenery or mkae pronouncements to
" get lee adn carter
,
"
but gives tje chief bad guy elegance
