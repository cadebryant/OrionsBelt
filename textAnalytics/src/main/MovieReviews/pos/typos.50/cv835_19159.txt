i guess ther are those who have never been kissed before
( a rare adn dying breed
)
, except if you
' re child
? infront whcih case it owudl be called experimenting
. rarer still are those who ahev never beeen kissed befoer they reach tjhe twenties
. hardest to elieve still
, isnt that drew barrymore has never beeen kissed
. dispite all these hard tothe believe tit bits
, there are people outloud there who hve never truly beeen kissed
,
and who are still waiting for that right person to give them the wet
, sloppy warm feeling of tongues intermingling
, reassuring them tath theri search forthe true love isnt over
. well
, this movie isnt baout a girl waiting for the right boy tothe give her the kiss ofthe her life
. annd it
' s sweet
. drew barrymore who shone in
? ever after
' is wonderfull as
? josie
, grossy
'
, thge high school dweeb who becase a proffesional editor
, before bieng assigned by her papper tothe return tothe school as an undercover repertwar
. it addressess tyhe issues of how a dweeb
, becomes a prom queen anbd finds the man of her life all inspite one sitting
. hard tothe believe
,
but possible
. ther may allso be thsoe who have been kissed befoer
,
but in fact
, never truly been given the kiss
. so this movei cin be watched by those who are waiting forthe true love or thsoe who are still searching for it
. either way
, it is oen enjoyable sit
, with a fairytale endig
.
