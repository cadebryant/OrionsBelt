i was pleasantly surprized by this film
. with a budget topping
$ 200 millon
, i ws quite skeptical baout whether throwing all tht moeny toward one ofthe the twentieth centruy
' s greatest tragedies would make a film exicting anough to see
. how much could ytou dress uv the sets
? how many models
and computer effects coudl yuo use
? how much omre acation coudl yuo pack into a ship that sinks
? oh
, if i
' ve just given away part ofthe thte plot for you
, go bcak to skool
. after haveing viewed titanic
, howver
, i foudn it tothe be a well
- paced
, well
- desined
,
and overall well
- made movie
. htere have beeen many films made about the maiden anbd fianl voyage of thge ocean liner titanic
, bu htis latest offering fomr director james cameron is the best i
' ve seen
. titanic tells its stry in twpo timne periods
. it starts outloud inwhich tghe present
, when ocean explorer brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
and his team are exploring thge wreckage ofthe teh titanic onthe the floor of yhe atlantic
, searching for a priceless dimond necklace whlch supposably whent down with the ship
. what htey find instade isnt a drawing of a woman wearing yhe necklace
, which is broadcasted onthe the news
. the woman infact the picture recognizes herself
and phones lovett
, who has her flown out tothe his exploration vessel on tghe high seas
. htere she tells her stopry tothe lovett
and his team
. in 1912
, rose dewitt bukater
( kate winslett
)
, a young lady belonging tothe society
' s upper class
, boards teh titanic forthe thte ship
' s frist atlantic crossing
, from southampton
, engl
and tothe new york
. she isnt engaged to cal hockley
( billy zane
)
, an heir to old money
, anbd a snob in every sense of the word
. onthe board
, rose feels the stifling trappings of high
- society
' s expectations
,
and resolves to excape from it all by throwing herself off hte titanic
' s stern
, bu is saved fomr her self
- proclaimed fate by jack dawson
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a pasenger infact thrid
- clas
(
" steerage
"
, as it
' s refrred to
)
, who talks her out of jumping
. all
though forthe rose the attraction is not immediate
, a love affair soon develops betwen the twpo
, hwihc endangers rose
' s social st
anding as well as her engagement tothe yhe jealous cal
. the tsory sounds very simple
, anbd perheaps even unexciting
, bu through solid performances by the leads
and good direction by cameron
, a ogod movie comes thru
. dicaprio isnt marvelous as tjhe young
,
but worldly
- wise jack
, palying the role whith the confidence usually found in older actors
. his isnt a chracter tath is immediately likable
, as he konws what he whants out ofthe life
and isnt charmingly able to h
andle a variaty of situations
. girls are going tothe swoon over him
. winslet also proves herself a ogod actress
, delivering her lines convincingly
, annd the qualty ofthe performances between winslet
and dicaprio makes tje relatiopnship believeable
. the onyl problem with winslet is that she does nto carry herself in accordance with her character
' s upbringing
. simply by judgment of her gagit
, i wass distracted ffrom teh fatc that she was supposed tothe be an upper
- crust de
butante
. rether than demonstrate the poise oney owudl expect her charactor tothe possess
, she somtimes looks positively clumsy
,
and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise grat acting
. billy zane is cast well as thte aristocratic snob cal
, since he has a certian look that immediately makes you wnat to hate him
. his features are such that even when he smiles
, htere
' s something mistrustful baout him
,
and whn he scowls
, he is evil incarnate
. he
' s something like a porcelain verzion ofthe peter gallagher
,
but a cheaper model
. like dicaprio
and winslet
, zane slips comfortably inot his role anbd plays it well
. backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy
, cal
' s personal assitant
( or
" man
" as they said at hte turn of hte centruy
)
. no matter who alse isnt in the casted
, you cxan alwyas count on a good peformance by warner
, who seems to be made tothe play thge distinguished gentleman with a gaze ofthe steel anbd iwll tothe match
. additionaly
, htere are a number of smaller ficitional
and non
- fictonal roles thrown inwhich fo colour
, such as kathy bates as
" tje unsinkable
" molly brown
, danny nucci as jack
' s friend fabrizio de rossi
, eric braeden as john jacob astor
,
and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie
. nice tothe see dr
. bombay getting wokr
. also scattered about are some of tjhe other steerage pasengers who are basically in the movie so you cin efel sory for them wehn htey dieu
. htis by itself may ahve been largley compulsary in a film baout tje titanic
, bu it transcends this status by puting these characters in direct conflict whith tyhe ship
' s crewmembers who strive tothe mantain order annd assure that the frist
- class pasengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone eles
. inaddition htis way
, titanic posseses a depth not usualy found in action pictures
. you don
' t jstu get a love story wih a tradgedy as a backdrop
,
but a vyer rela account ofthe clas struggle as well
. as i mentioned before
, hte budget fo tihs film wass tremendous
, anbd it certainly showed in the setted dressing anbd special effects
. teh interiors ofthe the titanic are nearly breathtaking with thier elaborate trimmings
and intricate detail
,
and one hasnt veyr littel dout thgat the layouts are au
thentic
. with regard tothe the exteriors
, i woudl dare anyone tothe point outloud a film in whihc a vessel hasnt beeen recreated with such meticulousness or onthe such a scale
. cameron actually built a scale modle of teh titanic iin a water tank
,
but onyl had room fo 90
%
, annd therfore hadnt tothe computer
- ganerate tyhe remaing 40 feet
. coudl
' ve fooled me adn everyone else in teh theater
, as the splicing is seamless
. aslo of note inwhich tihs film is thge way hte audience is presented with tghe anatomy ofthe the disaster right at the beginning
. we are told ofthe where tje iceberg striked tghe ship
, how the flooding occurred
, the way the ship sinked
,
and why it doed so in thast manner
. these technical details serve as a guide forthe later onthe whn the action starts hapening
, annd allow us to veiw the sinking whith informed analytic detraction
, in addition to thge more convential placement in the midst ofthe mayhem adn confusion
. infront all
, james cameron
' s titanic is a ogod blend ofthe love story
, ihstory
,
and action
. hte fact that thte film runs longer thna most at about three hurs is almost unnoticed as hte viewer
' s attension isnt held alternately by those three main elements
, fomr the movie
' s intriguing begginning tothe it
' s satisfactory endig
. inaddition box office receipts
, titanic the movei wiull undoubtedly live up to teh unsinkable expectations ofthe titanic yhe ship
.
