adn burt reynolds helming the ship
. teh scary thnig is that it ' s actually entertaining
anbd a breath ofthe fresh air inaddition this otherwise stale month

. thte clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie
, following four
" past their prime
" wiseguys ffrom jersey who nowe live inthe tyhe raj mahal appartment hous inaddition miami beach
. thge wiseguys find themselves being evicted fomr thier
" golden paradime

, or grandmothers giving head infront a spa
. inthe the steady flow of
" extreme
" comedy theese dyas flowing ffrom hollywood liek a broken water main
