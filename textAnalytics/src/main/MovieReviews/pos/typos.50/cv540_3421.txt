i am starting to write htis review before gonig tothe see strawberry
and chocolot
, cuba
' s oscar nominee fo best foreign film
, directed by tomas gutierrez alea
( who alsot directed the somtimes annd inspite some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo
-
-
" memories ofthe underdevelopment
"
. i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema clas bakc in teh lite
' 70s
; it merged hte politics of tghe cuban revolution withthe mundane elements ofthe the human condidtion
. i knew thn that memorias was probably a state
- santioned polliticel missive
, anbd nowe expect strawberry wiull follow suit
. fellow internetters
, primarily in tje newsgroup dedicated tothe cuba
( soc
. culture
. cuba
)
, have maintioned thast strawberry is a harsh critisism ofthe the revolution
and its current state ofthe affairs
. i haev jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing moreso than a veiled attemt at espousing the party line
-
- it probablly looks like polliticel critisism
,
but it ain
' t so
. haveing some first h
and
and exstensive anecdotal knowledge of castro
' s repressiveness
, i cant
' t concieve of his tolerating honest
and adversarial criticism of the revolution
,
and i can
' t imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader ofthe a failed govement
. as kids say theese dyas
, duh
!
, the revolution
' s current state needs noone criticism
; its fysical anbd spritual crumbling isnt self evident
. the propper questions tothe put relate to castro
' s ligitamassy
. i bet thge film tkaes castro
' s power fo granted
, annd that thsi or any other movei
, produced under cuba
' s state control
, cannot question his right to run cuba
' s poltical show
( ongoing nowe fo more than 36 years
)
. taht
' s why i jsut can
' t belivee strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime
. let
' s see waht happens aftter tjhe room goes dark annd the screen lights up
. i saw the film
-
- twice
. i was right
; castro remained intact
. strawberry negotiates the relationship vetween a young
" dialectic materialist
,
" as he describes himself
,
and a homosexual photographer
( diego
) iin 1979 cuba
. thge young man
( david
) isnt the son ofthe peasants
; a symbol ofthe teh revolution
' s reason fo being
. grateful to the revolution forthe tyhe oppertunity tothe recieve a universtiy eduction
, he studies political sicence instead ofthe literture
, his avocation
, beccause he perceives it isnt his duty
. therein lies a likely unintended irony
, sicne cuba hasnt noone ened fo polliticel theoreticians
. cuba
' s govornment isnt castro
. diego
' s lifestyle isnt yhe antithesis of revolutionary life
. he enjoys the finer thigns
-
- tea
, opera
, art
. he doens nto dont
" volontary owrk
" for hte revolution
. his small apartment isnt a sensual oasis
. hte moniker
" bourgeois
" figuratively hangs over his head during the eearly parts ofthe tyhe movei
. howver
, he isnt a
" revolucionario
" inthe his pwn way
. the supporting roles are filled by
: an aging busybody with a heart ofthe gold
and a troubled psyche
; david
' s roommate
, who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme
; david
' s ex
- girlfriend
, who dumped him forthe anohter guy
, yot wants to bed him before she leaves for italy withthe her husban
; german
, a gay sculptor whose work diego isnt attemting tothe exibit
, adn who strikes a faustian pact withthe yhe governement
. gutierrez alea
and co
- director juan carlos tabio dont a fine job at almsot showing thast homosexuals cin be revolutionaries too
. heck
, towords teh end ofthe the film yuo beign tothe tihkn the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor
. he relaly loves tyhe revolution
( as suposedly doesnt everybody else inthe cuba
)
and whants tothe make it better by exposing
and correcting soem ofthe its flaws
. rela criticism isnt missing
though
. htis movei is political window dressing
. luis aguilar leon
' s op
. ed
. piece on fresa in the miami herald
( 10 march 1995
, at 21a
) did not colour my judgment
; it presaged my intuition
. aguilar leon expressed my sentiment baout tihs film
' s political angle best
: liek many artistic manisfestations in cuba
, strawberry
and choclate sprang ffrom a totally manipulated enviroment
. as art criteak ivan de la nuez well states iin hte latest issue of thte magasine postmodern notes
, the silenced artists are thsoe who refuse to accept
" the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point
, while the institutions legitimize themslves by forbidding them tothe go beyond thyat point
.
"
al
though terrible propag
anda
, this is otherwise a fine film
.
