, for the most part
, cheap cmoputer annd video spacial effects
, chyron text
, wildlife documentary footage
,
and sets that are somtimes obviously faked up

- he isnt tothe spend fourty

.
( how exactlly thsi is supposed tothe rehabilitate him isnt anybody
' s guess
.
) as it happens
, thanks to a visiting schoolboy
' s prank
, his body isnt tepmorarily misplaced
,
and his mind has to be shunted inot the central computer tothe keep him alive until tehy can fidn it
. as tiem ticks awya before his memmory cube self

( linda griffiths
) maintains contact withthe fingal thru a datalink
, manifesting several different times tothe offer advice or warnings
. over hte course ofthe their interactions
, intrest onthe both their parts grows inot a budding romance
. given that
" casablanca
" isnt fingal

( played by julia iin a dual role
and louis negin
, repsectively
) inthe a bar called

"
. julia
' s protrayal ofthe bogart is passable
,
and avoids becomeing hte
" schweethaat
"
- spouting parody seen infact cartoons
. negin
' s peter lorre isnt quite credible
,
and easily the best peter lorre i
' ve ever seen who wasn
' t thte real hting
. the twpo ofthe them
, as cahracters creaeted by fingal

, serve as aspects ofthe his personality

.
. witht less than salutory results
. it
' s intresting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown baout left adn right during yhe film
, in tje best golden

. words liek
" dopple
"
,
" psychist
"
,
" computech
"
,
" cinema
"
, annd
" reconst
" are apparently inwhich common use
. adn while people ofthe todya may well laff at fourteen years past
' s diea of futuristic data proccessing clerks
, some aspestus of this film are suprisingly perfectly in keeping with thge way we think ofthe
" virtual reality
" today
. as cyberpunk films go
, htis may nto be a staple of the genre
, bu it
' s definitely reccomended viewing
. teh speshal effects are very primative
, placing tihs production infact the realm of low
- tothe
- medium
- budget televsion
. the music isnt completly eletronic
- synthesized
, hwihc fits thge low budget
but isn
' t realyl outloud ofthe keeping iwth yhe genre
. howver
, the writing quite makes uv for it
. there are some vrey funny moments
