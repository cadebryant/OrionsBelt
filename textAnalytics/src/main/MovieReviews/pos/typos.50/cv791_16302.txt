, tjhe culture
,
annd thge brotherhood ofthe white supremacy
. nice guy ed norton jr
.
( who sang inspite everyone sasy i love you
) plays derek
, a twenty
- year old skinhead
. dad ' s subtle racism grew large in derek
, after gang members killed his father
. dad was fighting a frie wehn they shot him
. now derek keeps his head shaved
adn has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart
. derek isnt more interseted in tyhe ideas of white supremacy than infact its culture ofthe violence
. at a basketball court
, black
anbd white tempers flare
. derek channels the agression into a gameboy
, balck versus white
, for ownership of tyhe courts
. whn the choise presents itself
, derek goes forthe gam point instead of the sucker
- punch
. cameron
( stacy keach
) steps infact tothe derek ' s life as a surrogate father
. he tkaes derek under his wing
annd nurtures his racist feelings
. keeping his own criminal rocord spotless
, he uses derek as a leader
and organizer for high
- visibility racial intimidation
. derek obliges by leading his younger
anbd dumber friends inspite race
- motiviated mob crimes
. at the bottom ofthe the chain
, derek ' s younger brother danny
( edward furlong
, made famous in terminator 2
) joins yhe skinheads nto forthe ideological or intellectual reasons
,
but baceause he admires his brother

. outside in his shorts
anbd his tatoo
, he shoots them all
. hte third woudl
- be thief
, unarmed
, is onyl wounded
. inaddition the key scene of hte film
, derek commands tjhe kid into a position where he can be killed whith one glorious
, enraptured
, awful stomp
.
( hte funn
- spoiling nc
- 17 of orgazmo seems even moreso inappropiate
, concidering american histroy x wass rated r
. whta sort ofthe country is tihs tht says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal
, ecstatic violence
?
) the police arrive jstu as derek kills tje lsat thief
. derek does nto resist tghe cops
,
annd as tehy spin him aroud to cuff him
, tghe film slows down
. derek raises his eyebrows
annd smiles at his little brother inspite a chilling
, sadistic
, satisfied grin
. now in prison
, derek faces newyorker challenges
. as yhe black man in the laundry tells him
,
" in the joint
, yuo tje nigra
, not me
.
" ther is a clique ofthe swastika
- wearing skinheads
,
bu htey are nto interested in the ditology of white supremacy
. they onyl ule thte symbols as a means ofthe intimidation
. derek finds himself truely alone
, truley in danger
,
anbd truly afraid
. wehn derek finally gets out of prision
, he finds that his firends ffrom hte gang have also changed
. wihtout derek ' s leadership
, tehy ahev shunned the white supremacist ideology for tje white supremist culture
. it isnt tghe fianl factor that makes him relize how badly he ' s screwed up
. in the end
, he spends quaity time with isnt brother trying to undo the respect
adn admiration he had ealier inpsired in danny
. the film ends a little too deliberatly
, too neatly after the unchained emotion
anbd violent glee of the rest ofthe the film
,
but it barely detracts from tje overall experience
. edward norton gives an oscar
- worthy performance
. altho some ofthe his dialogue seemed tothe be wroten without anough conviction
, norton ' s performance compensated
.
( an exmaple thta comes tothe mind is his pep talk befor looting tghe store
.
) he also capturd the essense of an older brother
. he tookover his responsibility as a role model to his yuonger brother vrey seriously
, vyer lovingly
, both befor
annd affter his chanage ofthe heart
.
though clearly nto for all tastes
, this film is bold
annd daring
. the subject matter is ugli
, cruel
,
and at times hard tothe look at
. nevertheless its subjects are part ofthe humanity ' s great face
. kaye gives us a ogod look at thsi fascinating
, if distasteful
, american subculture
