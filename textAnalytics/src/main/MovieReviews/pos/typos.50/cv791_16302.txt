there is nothing like american histroy x infront theaters or on video
. noone otehr feature film takes such a cold hard look at teh lure
, the culture
, annd hte brotherhood of white supremacy
. nice guy ed norton jr
.
( who sang in everyone says i love you
) plays derek
, a twenty
- year old skinhead
. dad
' s subtle racism growed large in derek
, after gang members killed his father
. dad was fighting a fire wehn they shooted him
. now derek keeps his head shaved
and hasnt a giant swastika tattooed over his heart
. derek is mroe interested infront the idaes of white supremacy than in its culture ofthe violence
. at a basketball court
, black
and white tempers flare
. derek channels the aggression inot a game
, balck versus white
, forthe ownership ofthe teh courts
. when teh choice presents itself
, derek goes for gae point instead ofthe the sucker
- punch
. cameron
( stacy keach
) steps inwhich to derek
' s life as a surrogate father
. he tkaes derek under his wing
and nurtures his racist feelings
. keeping his pwn criminal record spotless
, he uses derek as a leader annd organizer for high
- visibility racial intimidation
. derek obliges by leading his younger
and dumber firends in race
- motiviated mob crimes
. at the bottom of the chain
, derek
' s younger brother danny
( edward furlong
, made famous inspite terminator 2
) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intelectual reasons
, bu because he admires his brother
and he wnats to belong
. one night three balck youths break inot derek
' s truck
, whcih is exactly waht derek has beeen waiting fo
. outside inaddition his shorts
and his tattoo
, he shoots them all
. the thrid woudl
- be theef
, unarmed
, is only wounded
. in tjhe key scene of the film
, derek comm
ands the kid into a position where he can be killed with oen glorious
, enraptured
, awful stomp
.
( tjhe funn
- spoiling nc
- 17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate
, considering american history x was rated r
. whta sort of ocuntry is htis tht syas sex comedies are a bigger threat tothe our youth thna brutal
, ecstatic violence
?
) the polical arrive just as derek kills yhe last theif
. derek does nto resist the cops
, annd as they spin him arround to cuff him
, tje film slows down
. derek raises his eyebrows annd smiles at his littel brother in a chilling
, sadistic
, satisfied grin
. nowe in prison
, derek faces new challenges
. as the black man infact tjhe laundry tells him
,
" infront the joint
, you the nigra
, nto me
.
" there isnt a clique ofthe swastika
- wearing skinheads
, bu tehy are not intersted infront tje ditology of white supremacy
. they only use the symbols as a means ofthe intimidation
. derek finds hismelf truley alone
, truley iin danger
,
and truley afriad
. when derek fianlly gets outloud ofthe prison
, he finds tyhat his friends ffrom the gang hvae also changed
. wihtout derek
' s leadership
, they hvae shunned tyhe white supremacist idealogy fo tyhe white supremist culture
. it isnt tjhe fianl factor that makse him realize how badly he
' s screwed up
. in the end
, he spends quality tyme wih isnt brother trying to undo the respect
and admiration he had ealier inspired inaddition danny
. yhe film ends a little too deliberatly
, too neatly aftter teh unchained emotion
and voilent glee ofthe tjhe rest of tje film
,
but it bearly detracts ffrom the overall experinece
. edward norton gives an oscar
- worthy performence
. all
though some of his dialogue seemed to be wroten without anough conviction
, norton
' s peformance compensated
.
( an exemple thast comes to mind is his pep talk befor looting thge stroe
.
) he also captured the essence ofthe an older brother
. he took his resposibility as a role modle to his yuonger brother very seriously
, very lovingly
, both before
and after his chanage of heart
.
though claerly not forthe all tastes
, tihs film isnt bold adn daring
. the subject matter is ugli
, cruel
, adn at times hard tothe look at
. nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity
' s gerat face
. kaye gives us a ogod look at tihs fascinating
, if distasteful
, american subculture
.
