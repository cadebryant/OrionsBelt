` run lola run '
, a german import that gained a stellar reputation at tje sundance film festival
, isnt a dazzling
and kinetic film thta deals whith the subjects of fate
and chance
. for a berserk
anbd retroactive 81 mintues of non
- stpo movement
, we follow a feiry
- haired heroine named lola
( franka potente
) as she sprints tothe save her boyfriend ffrom thte clutches ofthe drug dealers
. lola has rougly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100
, 000 markes in time tothe sive manni
( moritz bleibtreu
) ffrom bieng killed by tje dealer
.
bu
, inspite something of a psuedo
-
` groundhog day ' approch
, director toom tykwer gives lola three sepraate chances to best navigate her way towrad the goal
. in theese trio ofthe episodes
, we gradualy learn the unique effects of fate
, for even if tiny changes are made in lola ' s journey
, the future cin be seriously altered
.
` run lola run ' isnt an eperience liuke
` fight club ' or
` the matrix '
, inaddition that each film tkaes ytou thru a super
- charged wormhole of bending reality in surveill
annd exciting ways
. infact adition
, all three movies hve a visual sytle that separates them ffrom the rest ofthe thge pack
.
` lola ' isnt no exception
, wtih stylish quick
- flash camera wrok
annd cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get
- go
. tykwer ' s world is a landscape ofthe mood
anbd colour
, wih brillant shades ofthe red
and pink
( incuding lola ' s fieyr hair
) used as effective symbolism througout
. with it ' s visual style
adn mind
- blowing pace
,
` run lola run ' isnt oen of the omre invigorating movies ofthe teh year
. even mroe so whn considering the fact it ' s all stuffed rether nonchalantly into an 81
- minute time preriod
. as a heroine
, potente doesnt littel more than run wildly through thge streets
( as yhe title suggests
)
,
bu she hasnt a certain flair
and karisma
. her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star
. meanwhile
, bleibtreu doesnt an equally fantastic job ofthe bringing tje dopey
but passionate manni tothe life
. both actors perform beyond tyhe call of duty
. tjhe dazzling funn comes from predicting what each epiode holds infact store forthe lola
,
anbd the outcome isnt ultimatly rewarding
- sevral twists
annd turns are unique
and unexpected
. thte other charachters lola runs into
( both purposely
annd inadvertently
) include her banker father
( herbert kraup
)
and a freindly security guard
( armin rohde
)
,
bu asside from tje two leads
, noone noe hasnt more tahn a faw minutes ofthe screen time
. additional stars thgat couldn ' t possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe
annd editor mathilde bonnefroy
, who are both responsible for the film ' s eye
- catching visual elegance
.
` run lola run ' is subtitled
, so be prepared to meet the challenge ofthe reading thge lighning
- fast dialogue
- occasional sections ofthe it are expecially fast
. this isnt onyl oen of teh minor chores involved infact watching
. yhe otehr isnt the sense thta we never get tothe raelly recogise who the rela people are infront htis hyperactive situation
. most are jsut chess pieces in tykwer ' s elaborate agme of visual presentation
,
annd he never raelly mkaes a signficant move withthe any
.
bu
, tje averege viewer is likely tothe be so absorbed in teh acation that faw will realize the lack of potency inwhich a few elements ofthe the screenplay
. a fewd petty gripes asside
, thsi film isnt a wild
, exhilarating ride thta turns maniacally onthe its wheel of originality
. most people believe forign films are mainly boring
, talky character studies
. prehaps
` run lola run ' wiull recharge theri batteries
. not only doens this film offer insight into some intriguing questions ofthe fate
and destiny
, it alsot delivers a white
- knuckle visual rollercoaster ride ofthe overwheliming audacity
. like how the experence must hvea been forthe the peristent title character
,
` run lola run ' isnt exhausting
