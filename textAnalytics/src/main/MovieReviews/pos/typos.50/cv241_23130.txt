ther ws a lot riding on this movie
. everyone even moderately interseted in tyhe
" scream
" sories was dying to know how it owudl end
. wqat owudl be thte
" fianl ect
"
? this is yhe end ofthe an era for them
, a movie which has kept them uv nights searching for clues onthe the internet
, talking
and tossing arund rumors with their equally enthused buddies
,
and
, forthe kids under 17
, those elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket to noe movei
anbd hopping inot
" scream
" hwile narrowly escaping thsoe menacing ushers who are onyl a eyar or twpo older than themselves
. no ened tothe worry
;
" scream 3
" isnt endlessly inventive
and entertaining
, a fine epilogue to the sories that made kevin williamson a household name
, reinvented yhe horror genre
,
and continued in the self
- referential
, post
- modern tradition of quentin
annd co
. so
, how does tghe story go
? as oppossed tothe what smoe fanatical internet sites woudl have you beileve
, sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, nowe all
- grown
- uv
and constantly dealing with her pass in the constantly tormented sector ofthe her psyche
, is nto living inthe hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress
,
bu rether in upstate califronia
, living
, understandably
, alone in yhe confines ofthe fences
anbd vast security systems
. she works at home as a crisis center affiliate over thge phone
.
but that
?
?
? s nto where the movei starts off
. instade
, inthe a tactict tyhat reminded me of the somewhat similiar
,
anbd conceptually horrifying
, sequence infact
" eye forthe an eye
"
( 1995
)
, cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, now a big star
, drives hmeo to his girlfriend infact trafic when the killer calls
, demands tghe loction ofthe sidney
?
?
? s hmeo
,
and
, whn he doesn
?
?
? t git it
, threatens the life ofthe cotton
?
?
? s girlfriend christine
,
anbd cotton cin
?
?
? t dont anytying tothe stpo him
. thge rest ofthe tghe sequence is partcularly clever
, setting uv a constant throughout thge picture
: hte killer hasnt a high
- tech electronic voice
- changer thta tops that ofthe thge firt twpo
. nto onyl does he soudn unmistakeably liuke talented voice
- over artist roger jackson
( ha
, ha
)
, he cxan now easily duplicate the voices ofthe tjhe lead cahracters
, includng sidney
,
and thge returned agle weathers
( courtney cox arquette
)
annd dewey riley
( david arquette
)
. at yhe same time
, stab 3
, tje thrid film
- within
- a
- film based arround the characters
and events of woodsboro
adn windsor college
, has tooked a less authentic approach this time around iin return to woodsboro
; wheras the account ofthe tyhe first two films was true
, the franchise withing
" scream
" hasnt now become totally fictional
. nevertheless
, we leran
, cotton made an appearance in thge movei which is now inwhich production
, as himself tothe be killed off in the first scene
. so
, it seems thyat the real killer isnt offing our heroes inwhich tyhe order in which tehy bite it in the movie
?
? ' either the actor portraying them
, or the rela thing
. sometimes both
. clever
, indeed
.
bu
, who goes enxt
? noone noe knows
. threee different scripts weere penned
, we
?
?
? re told
, to keep teh true finale off thge internet
( a nod tothe the
" scream
" 2 fiasco a few years back
)
and no one knows for sure whlch one the killer read
. still
, all tjhe hwile sidney stays concealed infront her home
, onyl visting dad for tjhe firt half
- hour ofthe hte film
, hwile also having horrifying visions ofthe her mother
, whic tkaes us bakc a bited tothe sidney
?
?
? s fear ofthe becomeing what her mother was
?
? ' or
, at least
, what her mother wass secretly
. when sidney finally ventures out to hollywood as the murders become omre prevelant
, she
?
?
? s chased onto tjhe setted of stab 3
, wandering thru
" woodsboro
,
" writed
adn directed as an odd
, surreal
, nightmare indeed
, this isnt noe of
" scream 3
"
?
?
? s finest moments
. okay
, over the years
, i
?
?
? ll admit that i
?
?
? ve become quite hte
" scream
" fan
. no
, i don
?
?
? t hvae the ghostface costume or teh director
?
?
? s cut laserdisc
,
but i often fidn mysef compelled to pop infront the dvd ofthe either member of yhe preceeding duo
,
and cxan git quite caught uv infact the dramtic element ofthe theese films
( yes
, i said
" dramtic element
"
)
, somtimes debating witht familiy
annd friends tjhe possibilities
annd endless theories thyat hve become quintessentially affiliated withthe
" scream
"
. througout tjhe film
,
though
, i noticed a much mroe subtle approach tahn the otehr two films
. granted that htere
?
?
? s stabbin
- a
- plenty going on throughout
,
but there
?
?
? s considerably less blood
, less gore
. honestly
, i like tihs approach
. it
?
?
? s omre classical
, more rebellious
, constantly demonstrating the capable direction of wes craven
. he knows when tothe hold back
and at the same time makse the movie ooze iwth energy
, illustrating the delicate poise flowing from his years ofthe experienec
. smoe criticists have noted that
" scream 3
" seems to tkae itself omre seriously this tiome
; maybe so
, or maybe screenwrighter ehren kruger
( arlington road
)
, who tookover over affter williamson hadnt scheduling conflicts
, saw an oportunity forthe true irony
?
? ' maybe even a littel bited ofthe satire
?
? ' if the film worked inaddition a few omre clich
?
? s
. what puts a damper on this otherwise exceptional
and creative film
, i
?
?
? m affraid
, is the endig
, or
, rather
, the idenity of the killer
. it doens tghe job
, i guess
, accomplishes what it shoudln
, bringing thge three films full circle
,
bu apon my frist viewing it seemed rather dissatisfying becouse it appears a little too contrived
, too arbitary
; aftter a second viewing
, which i endeavored upon due to this recurring disapprobation
, the killer
?
?
? s idenity still seems a little too random
,
but his motivation came across more soudn tihs time arund
,
adn hte eventual conclusion wass ultimatly mroe satisfying
. all inaddition all
,
" scream 3
" does nto fall victum to the most lamented priciple ofthe a triology
: it is nto the worst of tje films
. as a trilogy
,
" scream
" was a lot of funn
; refreshing
, humorous
, offbeat
. almsot sad to see it go
.
bu
then
, it does seem best to quitted while you
?
?
? re ahead
,
and
" scream 3
" does a fine job of providing closure to its charachters
. for now
,
" scream
" holds hte title as the finest serieses of horror films tothe be commitetd to celluloid
. not too shabby
.
