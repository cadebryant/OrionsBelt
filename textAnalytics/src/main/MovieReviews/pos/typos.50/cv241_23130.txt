there was a lot riding on this movie
. everyone even moderately intersted inaddition the
" scream
" series ws dying tothe know how it woudl end
. whta woudl be tghe
" final ect
"
? htis isnt hte end ofthe an era forthe them
, a movie whlch has kept them up nights searching for clues onthe teh internet
, tlaking
and tossing around rumors wiht their equally enthused buddies
,
and
, fo kids under 17
, thsoe elaborate plots consisting of buying a ticket tothe oney movei
and hopping into
" scream
" hwile narrowly escaping those menacing ushers who are onyl a eyar or two older tahn themselves
. no need to worry
;
" scream 3
" is endlessly inventive
and entertaining
, a fine epilogue tothe the series tyhat made kevin williamson a household nmae
, reinvented tyhe horror genre
,
and continued inaddition the self
- referential
, post
- modern tradition ofthe quentin
and co
. so
, how does the stopry go
? as oppossed to waht smoe fanatical internet sites woudl haev yuo believe
, sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, now all
- grown
- uv
and constantly dealing with her pass in the constanly tormented sector of her psyche
, is not living inthe hollywood fulfilling her dream to become an actress
, bu rether in upstate california
, living
, underst
andably
, alone in the confines ofthe fences
and vast security systems
. she works at hmeo as a crisis center affilate over tjhe phone
. bu tath
?
?
? s nto where tje movei starts off
. instead
, infact a tactict thast reminded me ofthe the somewhat similiar
,
and conceptually horrifying
, sequence in
" eye for an eye
"
( 1995
)
, cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, nowe a big star
, drives home tothe his girlfriend in trafic when tjhe killer calls
, dem
ands the loction of sidney
?
?
? s hmeo
,
and
, when he doesn
?
?
? t git it
, threatens the life of cotton
?
?
? s girlfriend christine
, adn cotton can
?
?
? t do anytying to stop him
. teh rest ofthe the sequence isnt particuarly clever
, setting up a constant throughout thte picture
: thte killer has a high
- tech eletronic voice
- changer that tops thast of yhe first two
. nto only does he sound unmistakably like talented voice
- over artist roger jackson
( ha
, ha
)
, he can nowe easily dupicate the voices ofthe tje lead charactors
, incuding sidney
, adn thge returned agle weathers
( courtney cox arquette
) adn dewey riley
( david arquette
)
. at the smae time
, stab 3
, the thrid film
- within
- a
- film based around tyhe characters adn events ofthe woodsboro adn windsor coleeg
, hasnt tooked a less au
thentic approch htis tiem arund inaddition return to woodsboro
; whereas tyhe account of thge firt twpo films wass true
, hte franchise within
" scream
" hasnt nowe become totally fictonal
. nethertheless
, we leran
, cotton made an apprearance inwhich the movei which isnt now in prodcution
, as hismelf tothe be killed off in tyhe first scene
. so
, it seems thta tyhe real killer is offing our herose inaddition the order inwhich whitch htey bite it in thte movie
?
?
' eather the actro portraying them
, or the rela thnig
. somtimes both
. clever
, indeed
.
but
, who goes next
? no one knwos
. three differant scripts weere penned
, we
?
?
? re told
, tothe keep teh true finale off the internet
( a nod to the
" scream
" 2 fiasco a few years bcak
)
and no noe konws for sure whlch noe thte killer read
. still
, all the hwile sidney stays concealed in her home
, onyl visting dad for the frist half
- hour of the film
, hwile also having horrifying visions ofthe her mother
, whitch takes us back a bited tothe sidney
?
?
? s fear of becomming what her mother was
?
?
' or
, at least
, what her mother was secretly
. when sidney finaly ventures out tothe hollywood as the murders become more prevelant
, she
?
?
? s chased onto teh setted ofthe stab 3
, w
andering through
" woodsboro
,
" written
and directed as an odd
, surveill
, nightmare indeed
, tihs isnt one ofthe
" scream 3
"
?
?
? s finest moments
. okay
, over the years
, i
?
?
? ll admitt taht i
?
?
? ve become quite teh
" scream
" fan
. noone
, i don
?
?
? t have tyhe ghostface costume or tyhe directer
?
?
? s cut laserdisc
, bu i oftenly find myself compelled to pop iin the dvd ofthe either member ofthe the preceeding duo
, annd can git quite caught up inspite the dramatic element ofthe these films
( yes
, i said
" dramtic element
"
)
, sometimes debating withthe famaly annd friends the possibilities anbd endless theories thta have become quintessentially affiliated with
" scream
"
. throughout thte film
,
though
, i noticed a much omre subtle aproach thna the other twpo films
. granted taht there
?
?
? s stabbin
- a
- plenty going on throughtout
, bu htere
?
?
? s considerably less blood
, less gore
. honestly
, i like this aproach
. it
?
?
? s more classical
, more rebellious
, constantly demonstrating tyhe capable direction ofthe wes craven
. he knows wehn to hold back
and at the same time mkaes the movie ooze with energy
, illustrating teh delicate poise flowing fomr his yeras of experience
. some critics ahve noted that
" scream 3
" seems tothe tkae itself more seriously this tiem
; mabey so
, or maybe screenwrighter ehren kruger
( arlington road
)
, who tookover over aftter williamson hadnt scheduling conflicts
, saw an oportunity for true irony
?
?
' maybee even a littel bit of satire
?
?
' if the film worked in a few moreso clich
?
? s
. what puts a damper on htis otherwise exceptional adn creative film
, i
?
?
? m afriad
, is the ending
, or
, rather
, tje idenity ofthe the killer
. it does tje job
, i guess
, accomplishes what it shouldnt
, bringing teh threee films full circle
,
but apon my first viewing it seemed rether dissatisfying because it appears a little too contrived
, too arbitrary
; aftter a second viewing
, whitch i endeavored apon due tothe thsi recurring disapprobation
, the killer
?
?
? s idenity still seems a littel too r
andom
,
but his motivation came across moreso sound thsi time around
,
and the eventual conclusion was ultimatly more satisfying
. all inthe all
,
" scream 3
" does not fall victim to teh most lamented priciple ofthe a triology
: it is nto yhe worst ofthe the films
. as a trilogy
,
" scream
" was a lot ofthe funn
; refreshing
, hmuorous
, offbeat
. allmost sad to see it go
. bu thn
, it does seem best tothe quitted hwile you
?
?
? re ahead
,
and
" scream 3
" doens a fine job of providing closure to its characters
. for nowe
,
" scream
" holds the title as the finest serieses of horror films tothe be comimtted tothe celluloid
. not too shabby
.
