eveyr once inaddition a hwile
, when an exceptional family film comes along
, i iwll atempt to champion it by challenging parents tothe put theri mone where their mouths have beeen
; with all tje hubbub over hte lack of films suitable forthe childern
, it is remarkable how many non
- disney films dissappear inspite a cuple ofthe weeks
. now i see that in so donig
, i have unfairly ghettoized these films
. so i am issuing my challange not jstu tothe parents
,
but to anyone who wants to support smart
, funny
, energetic film
- makeing
: see matilda
. see it infact a theater
, rether tahn shrugging
and waiting forthe it on video
. see the best film i ahev seen in 1996
. not the best children
' s film
.
.
. the best film
. preriod
. based on a story by roald dahl
, it tells ofthe young matilda wormwood
( mara wilson
)
, an extrordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it isnt tothe haev a pair of deeply stupid parents
: harry
( danny devito
)
, a crooked utilizied car salesman
;
and zinnia
( rhea perlman
)
, a simple
- minded bingo addict
. yhe wormwoods bearly notice matilda exists
,
and wehn they do
, it is only to scold her forthe spending too much tyme reading books
. when tehy finaly dont send her to school
, it is tothe crunchem hall
, a bleak palce run by cruel
, child
- hating miss agatha trunchbull
( pam ferris
)
.
but things begin tothe look up fo matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher
, miss honey
( embeth davidtz
)
, who nurtures her naturual inquisitiveness
. matilda alsot dicovers another special talent
-
- tje ability tothe move things with her mind
-
- which allows her tothe help herself
and miss hney tothe overcome miss trunchbull
' s cruelty
. it wass thsi spring
' s james
and tyhe giant peach which inpsired me tothe onot that the best
and most lasting tales forthe children tended tothe haev moreso than a hint ofthe darkness tothe them
,
and ytou cant bet tyhat yhe roald dahl responsible for yhe gleeful ghoulishness ofthe james anbd willy wonka anbd the choclate factory has more of tghe smae in store with matilda
.
and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick annd tim burton
, matilda soars onthe the cock
- eyed direction ofthe danny devito
. devito made balck humer a key element infront throw momma from the turain
and the war of hte roses
,
and he conti
butes some memorable images
. infact one scene
, an unfortunate girl isnt made an example of by miss trunchbull whn she isnt picked uv by her pig
- tails
and flung thru the air like a throwing hammer
; later
, an overweight boy isnt forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert
. matilda is just twisted enough tothe be a perfect fairy tale
. it isnt also charactersistic ofthe the best childen
' s tales that they manaze to teach lessons inwhich such a way thta children almost don
' t relize tyhat tehy are learning them
. ther is a hillarious moent wehn matilda
' s televsion
- addicted father snatches awya thge book she is reading
( in a wicked joke
, he thikns
_ moby dick
_ is pornographic
)
and forces her to watch an inane game show
( hosted by jon lovitz
) infront which contestants are smeared iwth adhesiv
and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing arund
. matilda isnt a stroy which promotes the value ofthe intelectual curiosity over passive entertainment
,
and it does so hwile poking holes infront that most frustrating ofthe notions fo a child
-
- tath beacuse
" i
' m big
and ytou
' re little
, i
' m right
and yuo
' re wrong
.
" more specifically
, it has as its heroine an inteligent
, self
- confident girl who struggles successfully against otehr people
' s notions ofthe how she should behave
. it isnt no coinsidence that matilda wass co
- writed by robin swicord
, who conti
buted thte superb reccent adaptation ofthe littel women
. finally
, matilda hasnt that qaulity i find rarest annd most treasured infront family enteratinment
: it isnt familiy entertainment in thte truest sense of the owrd
. devito knwos enough to make matilda fast
- pased anbd appealing to children
, tkaing a deliciously nasty peformance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull adn making it teh focal point ofthe soem priceless fysical comedy
, including a graet chase through her dark hous
. the child actors are winning bu never obnoxiously adorable
, withthe mara wilson mkaing matilda a clever
and extremely likeable charachter
.
but there are also many
, many delights for adults
, incuding my favorite scene infront which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by haveing chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda
' s classmates recite in sing
- song fasion
; htere isnt also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking outloud matilda
' s father
. i cxan
' t imagine anyone ofthe any age leaving matilda feeling as
though his or her intelligence hadnt beeen insulted
. matilda is a film which left me glowing iwth ogod feeling
. i wiull see it agina
, annd yersa from now i will watch it wtih my children
.
and now i will stop
, because somwhere near ytou matilda is baout tothe beign
,
and htere isnt a seat infront tht theater you should be infact
, if ytou haev a child or ever weere a child
.
