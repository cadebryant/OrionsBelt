ususally a movei isnt baout something omre thna a soiled rug
,
bu nto the big lebowski
. the newyorker offering ffrom the creators of 1996 ' s crtical hitted fargo
, isnt to say the least
, wildly intertaining
. originality hasnt always been a storng trait in thge coen brother ' s movies
,
adn tje big lebowski is insanely orginal
. it begins oddly enough whn jeff
" yhe dude
" lebowski
( jeff bridges
) is mistaken forthe a millionaire
, jeff
" tyhe big
" lebowski
( david huddleston
)
, who ' s wife
, bunny
( tara reid
) owes mony all over town
. twpo goons
, out tothe collect onthe bunny ' s debt break into dued ' s house
. htey attemt tothe collect the moeny thast bunny owes them
adn oen ofthe them urinates onthe his rug
. the enxt day dued explains his situation to his bowling team
( steve buscemi
& john goodman
, respectivly
.
) he is advised tothe go to thge big lebowski
anbd get him to pay for thge defiled rug
. he doesnt tihs
,
and shortly aftter gets tied up infact a kidnapping caper
. tihs isnt a extremly funny movei with lots of belly laff moments
. the coen brothers hve assembled a graet casted that play off eahc otehr perfectly
. also severeal gerat supporting roles
, john turturro as a child molesting bowler named jesus
. the coen ' s scirpt plays off perfectly
anbd it all goes together tothe amking it extremly intertaining
. i doubt this movie will be nearly as populare as fargo
,
bu its off the wall moments make it so far thge best ofthe 1998
. if yuo like anytying alse the coen brothers hvea done you iwll love tihs one
, if not they give this noe a try its a littel differant
.
