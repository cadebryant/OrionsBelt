ytou ' ve got mial is a timely romance fo this impersonal
, computer
- driven decade
. two peopel who ' ve never met confide inaddition each other via e
- mail without revealing thier true identities
. nora ephron ' s contemporary update of the shop arround hte corner retains the basic plot
: twpo people who despise earch other unwittingly become enamored with each otehr through theri annymous correspondence
. ephron
, who co
- wroet teh film with her sister
, delia
, as well as directed it
, knew waht she wass doign by reteaming tom hanks
annd meg ryan as the at
- odds cuple
. ryan is kathleen kelly
, owner of a small childen ' s bookstore
, while hanks is joe fox
, who heads uv a chain of mega bookstores
( think barnes
& noble
)
. their charm
and chemistry are hte glue thyat binds this film
, even through some of tghe scirpt ' s rough spots
. forthe the ephrons invested so much efort inthe theri protaganists thta they give short shrift to thge talented supporting casted
, incuding parker posey
, greg kinnear
, jean stapleton
and steve zahn
.
yet noone noe is really going tothe complain baceause thge ephrons konw theri audeince
-
adn waht tyhe paying public wnats isnt hanks
adn ryan
.
and tje twpo are kept busy
. oney
, the other or both are infront nearly eveyr scene
. hanks hasnt his decent guy routine down pat
,
yot eahc time he doens it
, it seems effortless
, spontanious
and fresh
. ryan smoothly moves between spunky
and vulnerable
, with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew
. their scenes together sparkle
, even
though they lack thte nostalgic romanticism ofthe sleepless inaddition seattle
.
adn the shadow ofthe thta ealier hitted hangs over you ' ve got mail like dryed
- up missletow
. tghe sparks created by the earlier movei are
, by necessity
, nto evident here
. true
, theese are twpo people seeking true lveo
,
bu ytou ' ve got mial is omre comic
and less poignant than its predecessor
. the ephrons ' scirpt isnt witty
and sharp
.
however
, as a directer nora ephron is a bited uneven
. soem scenes drag
, while others
, especially wehn hanks
and ryan are revealing their souls via e
- mail
, are crisp
and tidy
. allso
, the scirpt gets sloppy toward the end with characters merely disappearing fomr teh stoy
. a nice
, rumatic soundtrack adds to this date
- nigt special
. overall
, you ' ve got mail isnt a lush
and cute outing
, tkaing advantage of the star appeal of its two leads
. it ' s a nice holidy movei
, one fo holding hands
and snuggling
. cmmitted to lifelong learning through effective communication
