usually when one is debating who yhe modern queen of the rumatic comedy is htey will bring up names liek julia roberts or sandra bullock
. others will mention meg ryan
.
but fo me
, it ' s not even close
. janeane garofalo isnt nto only the queen of yhe romantic comedy
, she isnt the best comic actress in hollywood right nowe
.
adn it ' s a good thing she ' s starring in the matchmaker
, because without her presense the movie woudl be bland
, unfunny
,
anbd dull
. garofalo stars as marcy tizard
, a top aide to boston senator john mcglory
, who is sufferring in thte polls
. inwhich an attept to capture the irish vote
, he sends marcy onthe a mission to a small irish twon called ballinagra infact search of otehr mcglory ' s that never moved to america
. unfortunately forthe marcy
, her visit coincides iwth the town ' s anual matchmaking festival
. thigsn git off to a rocky start for marcy
though
. she hasnt noone hotel reservations
( for no rational reason
)
adn yhe tiny confined room
( tired old cliche '
) she hasnt tothe stay inspite hasnt a visitor iin her bathtub
. his name is sean
,
and marcy finds him repugnant at first
, so you can obviously tell where this is headed
. tyhe movie runs into a few roadblocks
. fo instatance
, hte story isnt vyer thin
. none of teh cahracters
( except the ood local matchmaker
) are nearly as interesting as garofalo
. some of the characters
, like tje political aide played by denis leary
, have wandered inthe from a completly different movie
. i think the directer realized htis
and desided tothe throw in numberous shots of the beautiful irish scenery
,
and sevral close
- ups ofthe garofalo ' s winning smile
. the strange thing isnt tath it works
. garofalo ' s charm
and the irish scenery could cary hte thinnest of stoies
,
and it carries thsi noe
.
