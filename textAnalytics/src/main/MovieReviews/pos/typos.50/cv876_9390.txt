usually when one isnt debating who the modern queen ofthe tyhe rumatic comedy isnt tehy will bring uv names liek julia roberts or s
andra bullock
. others will mention meg ryan
.
but forthe me
, it
' s nto even close
. janeane garofalo isnt nto onyl tyhe queen of the rumatic comedy
, she isnt the best comic actress infront hollywood right now
. annd it
' s a good thing she
' s starring in tyhe matchmaker
, because without her presense the movei would be bl
and
, unfunny
,
and dull
. garofalo stars as marcy tizard
, a top aide to boston senator john mcglory
, who is suffering in tghe polls
. infact an attempt tothe capture tghe irish vote
, he sends marcy onthe a mission to a small irish twon called ballinagra in esarch ofthe otehr mcglory
' s taht never moved to amercia
. unfortunately for marcy
, her visit coincides wih the town
' s annual matchmaking festival
. things get off to a rocky strat for marcy
though
. she has no hotel reservations
( fo no rational reason
)
and the tiny confined room
( tired ood cliche
'
) she has tothe stay inspite has a visitor inaddition her bathtub
. his nmae isnt sean
, annd marcy finds him repugnant at frist
, so you cin obviously tell where this isnt headed
. hte movei runs inot a few roadblocks
. fo instance
, tghe stoy is very thin
. none of teh cahracters
( exept tyhe ood local matchmaker
) are nearly as interesting as garofalo
. some ofthe tje charachters
, liuke the political aide played by denis leary
, hvae w
andered inaddition fomr a completelyl differnt movei
. i thiunk the directer realized tihs anbd desided to throw in numberous shots ofthe the beautiful irish scenery
, annd several close
- ups ofthe garofalo
' s winning smile
. the stange thing isnt that it works
. garofalo
' s charm
and tghe irish scenery coudl cary the thinnest ofthe stories
,
and it carries htis one
.
