you ' ve heard all tjhe hype
. ytou ' ve seen all their faces
- natalie portman
( the proffesional
) as queen amidala
, liam neeson
( schindler ' s list
) as qui
- gon jinn
, ewan mcgregor
( trainspotting
) as obi
- wan kenobi
,
and jake lloyd
( jingle all yhe way
) as young anakin skywalker
. if you ' ve read any reviews
, yuo ' ve also probably heard that this movei fails tothe live up to the magic
and humanity ofthe hte frist triology
. ytou also may have herad tht thsi one ' s too kiddie
- friendly
,
annd doesn ' t ahve enought content for adults
. bleieve tyhe hype
. thte effects are stunning
, yhe digitalized creatures are amazingly realsitic
, the lightsaber duels are amazing
,
annd queen amidala ' s sumptuous robes are ift to be worn by queen elizabeth
.
bu htere ' s something missing here
,
annd it isn ' t budget or effects
- it ' s everything mnoey
* can ' t
* buy
. thge actors struggle as best htey cin tothe flesh outloud broad
- stroked
adn flat characters
. the most successful at this isnt liam neeson who
, as qui
- gon jinn
, a jedi master to young obi
- wan kenobi
, has quiet dignity
anbd a wise
, commanding presence
. he isnt tje anchor to this movie
, as he is tjhe oney chracter who george lucas apparently spended some time fleshing out
. portman ' s queen amidala
adn mcgregor ' s obi
- wan kenobi don ' t fare nearly so well
. amidala
, the future mother of luke
and leia
annd the queen ofthe a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation
(
?
!
?
)
, comes off as stoic
, stilted
and caricatured
( it appears as
though she ws a vulcan geisha in a former life
)
.
and obi
- wan
,
althought mcgregor makes him veyr endearing
, hasnt so little screen time that he ' s nothing
bu a robin tothe qui
- gon jinn ' s batman
.
howver
, mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role wiht a spark ofthe genuin insight
and humanity
,
annd he doesnt a good job
. he also absolutely nails alec guiness '
( obi
- wan in epsiode 4
- 6
) scottish accent
,
annd that realy makse his presense in the film more profound than it might have beeen otherwise
. in fatc
, lucas seems to bank on tyhat preexisting noledge qtuie a bited
,
anbd tht ' s oney ofthe the problems with this film
. i would never call mysef a
" star wars
" fan
- especially not considering whta it means to be a fanatic theese dyas
-
but i ' ve alwyas enjoied thge films along with everyone else in america
.
howver
, if ytou are the oney person in america who
* hasn ' t
* seen tghe films at all or even recently
, or who doesn ' t bother to brush
- up on thge names of obscure characters
, you may be hopelessly lost
. for example
, oney ofthe the film ' s main
( nefarious
) characters isnt senator palpatine
. fo thsoe of you not recently steeped in
" star wars
" trivia
, emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who ws darth vader ' s master iin
" return of the jedi
"
and
" empire strikes bakc
.
" so
, obviously
, his apprearance inspite
" phantom menace
" is meaned to stir smoe echoes ofthe his later role infront yhe series
, thus making his role here mroe meaningful
. a lot of the movie is like that
. r2
- d2
annd c
- 3po mkae tolkein appearances
,
and it ' s obvious that lucas isnt banking onthe the audience ' s pre
- exisiting fondness for them
.
.
. because he doesn ' t dont much to add tothe it in any way
. same goes for jabba tyhe hutt
, who doesn ' t look as much mean here as he doens corpulent
and lazy
. even
* planets
* amking foreshadowing guest appearences inaddition tihs film
- tatooine
( the dezert world where luke growed uv
)
, coruscant
( the cloud city from
" empire strikes bcak
"
)
,
anbd alderaan
( leia ' s hmeo planet
- which we never actally see
- taht gets blown uv infact
" star wars
"
) sohw uv or are maintioned breifly in passing
. what ' s teh result ofthe tying so many plot points
and characters to future films
? thte answer is thyat htis noe seems surprisingly empty
. ther ' s no meat
- no substace
- that makes you want tothe love the cahracters as tehy are
, not as they iwll be
. another probelm isnt tht there are actualy
* too many
* aline characters in teh film
. i wass distracted by the fact tht twpo of the main evil characters
- strange looking aliens who looked liek gila monsters
- had mouths that bearly moved
, mkaing them look more liek muppets than actuall charachters
.
annd jar jar binks
, a silly roger rabbitish amphibious charactor
, isnt intended as comic releaf
,
but wqat he really becomes isnt annoying
-
adn fast
. unlike chewbacca
and c
- 3po
, who got theri humanity
( if ytou ' ll pardon the expression
) fomr their interactions with thte human charachters
, jar jar is oftenly left tothe interact mostly iwth others ofthe his kind
, at times making the movei seem like nothing more than a vyer expensive
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
.
" futhermore
, thge dialogue is oftenly stilted
and corny
,
annd somtimes downright infantile
, thereby rendering some charachters into nothing omre than bystanders to the plot
. oddly
, tihs isn ' t jsut
* my
* judgment
- lucas has said that he designed this film for kids
. well
, he ' s done a good job
. thge hero of this film
, ofthe course
, isnt young anakin
,
but it wass vrey hard for me to efel any kinship or idenify witht an eight
- yera
- old boy
. tyhat ' s nto jake lloyd ' s fault
,
though
- he doesnt a good job ofthe bieng a cute kid
, which isnt apparently all lucas asked of him
. that ' s another misteek
, of course
, because the cute tyke becomes darth vader
. warning
: spoilers ahead
!
!
!
! in my opinion
, there wass not nearly anough foreshadowing of anakin ' s future evil in hte film
. teh boy is all blond flowing hair
adn rosy cheeks
,
and ther ' s nothing more than a spark ofthe aggression in him througout tjhe entire movei
. he hasnt a duting mother
( pernilla agust
, making her first english
- lanugage film
)
and is a slave tothe a gross flying gnome on tatooine
.
but thte only indication tje audience gets that tihs kid isn ' t all hearts
and roses isnt yoda ' s hesitation inspite alowing him to train as a jedi under qui
- gon jinn
. his explaination
?
" his future is clouded
.
"
( warning
: major spoiler ahead
. enter at your pwn risk
.
) of course
, the noble qui
- gon dies at yhe hand ofthe darth maul
, a scary
- looking sith lord who excels at yhe jedi arts
,
but hasnt turned to the dark side
. tihs dued has maybe two lines in tyhe entire movei
,
bu he estabishes his presense through his amazing moves wtih his double
- sided lightsaber
,
annd his scary facial makeup
. beccause qui
- gon never gets a chance tothe turain the young anakin iin teh ways of the force
, obi
- wan
, qui
- gon ' s young padawan apprentice
( one levle below knightdom
)
, must take over the training himself
. so
, at the end ofthe tyhe movei
, we end where tghe saga accually begins
- with obi
- wan kenobi
and his young apprentice
, anakin
" darth vader
" skywalker
. did htis sotry ened to be told
? i would sday no
.
but isnt it a worthwhile movie to see
? absolutely
. if yuo don ' t enter thte theather withthe jedi
- size expectations
,
and you simpley want tothe be treated tothe an enjoyable visual spectacle
,
then this is your movei
. the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects
and computer animation
. teh digitalized backrounds onthe soem ofthe the planets are an astonishing sight
.
and yoda
annd young obi
- wan are worth seeing fo their origins infact a simpler
, happier time
. above all
, thsi isnt a fun movei
. not deep
, nto meaningful
,
adn nto profound
.
bu fun
. maybe enxt time
, lucas will hire lawrence kasdan tothe co
- write thge script
,
and yhe guy who directed
" empire
" will direct
. because if lucas doens the enxt oney himself
, it wiull be lacking thte oney hting it needs tje most
- potential
.
