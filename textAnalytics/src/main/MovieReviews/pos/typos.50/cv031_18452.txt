you
' ve heard all hte hype
. you
' ve seen all thier faces
- natalie portman
( yhe proffesional
) as queen amidala
, liam neeson
( schindler
' s list
) as qui
- gon jinn
, ewan mcgregor
( trainspotting
) as obi
- wan kenobi
, anbd jake lloyd
( jingle all yhe way
) as young anakin skywalker
. if yuo
' ve read any reviews
, you
' ve alsot probably heard tyhat this movei fails to live uv tothe hte magic
and humanity ofthe the first trilogy
. yuo also may have heard that tihs one
' s too kiddie
- freindly
,
and doesn
' t have anough content forthe adults
. blieve the hype
. the effects are stunning
, the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic
, thte lightsaber duels are amazing
, adn queen amidala
' s sumptuous robes are ift tothe be worn by queen elizabeth
. bu ther
' s something missing here
,
and it isn
' t budget or effects
- it
' s everything money
* cxan
' t
* buy
. yhe actors struggle as best they cant to flesh out broad
- stroked anbd flat characters
. hte most successful at this isnt liam neeson who
, as qui
- gon jinn
, a jedi master to young obi
- wan kenobi
, hasnt quiet dignity
and a wise
, comm
anding presense
. he isnt the anchor to this movei
, as he isnt teh oen character who george lucas aparently spent soem time fleshing out
. portman
' s queen amidala adn mcgregor
' s obi
- wan kenobi don
' t fare nearly so well
. amidala
, hte future mother of luke annd leia anbd the queen ofthe a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation
(
?
!
?
)
, comes off as stoic
, stilted adn caricatured
( it appears as
though she was a vulcan gaysha in a fromer life
)
.
and obi
- wan
,
al
though mcgregor makes him veyr endearing
, has so littel screen time thta he
' s nothing bu a robin tothe qui
- gon jinn
' s batman
.
however
, mcgregor doesnt struggle manfully tothe infuse this surprisingly small supporting role wiht a spark ofthe genuine insight
and humanity
,
and he does a good job
. he also absolutely nails alec guiness
'
( obi
- wan iin episode 4
- 6
) scottish accent
,
and thyat really makes his presense infront the film more profound thna it might hvea beeen otherwise
. in fatc
, lucas seems tothe bank on thast preexisting knowledge qtuie a bit
,
and thyat
' s one ofthe the problems wtih this film
. i owudl never call myself a
" star wars
" fan
- expecially nto concidering what it means to be a fanatic theese days
- bu i
' ve alwyas enjoyed the films allong with everyone else in america
.
however
, if you are hte oen person in america who
* hasn
' t
* seen the films at all or even recently
, or who doesn
' t bother to brush
- up on the names of obscure charactors
, you may be hopelessly lost
. for example
, oney ofthe the film
' s main
( nefarious
) characters isnt senator palpatine
. for thsoe of you nto recently steeped in
" star wars
" trivia
, emperor palpatine is taht scary hooded apparition who ws darth vader
' s master infact
" return ofthe thge jedi
"
and
" empire strikes back
.
" so
, obviously
, his appearance in
" phantom menace
" isnt meant to stir some echoes of his later role infront the series
, thus mkaing his role here more meaningfull
. a lot ofthe yhe movei isnt like that
. r2
- d2 anbd c
- 3po make tolkein appearances
,
and it
' s obvious that lucas is banking onthe the audeince
' s pre
- existing fondness for them
.
.
. beacuse he doesn
' t do much tothe add to it inwhich any way
. smae goes for jabba thge hutt
, who doesn
' t look as much mean here as he does corpulent
and lazy
. even
* planets
* make foreshadowing guest appearances in htis film
- tatooine
( the dezert world where luke grew up
)
, coruscant
( the cloud city ffrom
" empire strikes bcak
"
)
, annd alderaan
( leia
' s home planet
- whihc we never atually see
- taht gets blown up in
" star wars
"
) show uv or are maintioned briefly infront passing
. what
' s the result ofthe tying so many plot points annd charachters tothe future films
? the answer is that this noe seems surprisingly empty
. htere
' s no meat
- no substance
- thast makes yuo watn to lvoe thte characters as they are
, nto as htey wiull be
. another problem is thyat there are actually
* too many
* alien charactors in the film
. i was distracted by yhe fact that twpo of hte main evil characters
- stange looking aliens who looked liuke gila monsters
- hadnt mouths thyat bearly moved
, mkaing them look more like muppets than actual characters
. adn jar jar binks
, a silly roger rabbitish amphibious chracter
, is intended as comic releaf
,
but wqat he really becomes is annoying
- anbd fast
. unlike chewbacca anbd c
- 3po
, who got their humanity
( if you
' ll pardon yhe expression
) from their interactions iwth the human characters
, jar jar isnt oftenly left to interact mostly with others of his kind
, at times mkaing thte movei seem like nothing more than a vyer expensive
" teenage mutant ninja turtles
.
" furthermore
, tyhe dialogue is oftenly stilted annd corny
,
and somtimes downright infantile
, therby rendering soem charachters into nothing mroe thna byst
anders to the plot
. oddly
, this isn
' t jstu
* my
* judgement
- lucas hasnt said that he designed htis film for kids
. well
, he
' s done a ogod job
. the hero of this film
, of course
, is young anakin
, bu it ws very hard fo me to efel any kinship or identify withthe an eight
- yearm
- ood boy
. thgat
' s not jake lloyd
' s fault
,
though
- he doesnt a good job of being a cute kid
, whic isnt apparantly all lucas asked ofthe him
. tht
' s another misteek
, of course
, baceause the cute tyke becomes darth vader
. warning
: spoilers ahead
!
!
!
! infront my opinyon
, ther ws not nearly enough foreshadowing ofthe anakin
' s future evil infront the film
. tghe boy is all blond flowing hair adn rosy cheeks
, anbd ther
' s nothing more than a spark of aggression inthe him
thoughout thte entire movie
. he has a duting mother
( pernilla agust
, making her first english
- laguage film
) adn is a slave to a gross flying gnome onthe tatooine
.
but thte only indication the audience gets tht htis kid isn
' t all hearts annd roses isnt yoda
' s hesitation inwhich alowing him to turain as a jedi under qui
- gon jinn
. his explanation
?
" his future is clouded
.
"
( warning
: major spoiler ahead
. enter at your own risk
.
) ofthe course
, the noble qui
- gon dies at yhe h
and of darth maul
, a scary
- looking sith lord who excels at hte jedi arts
, bu hasnt turned to teh dark side
. this dude has mabey two lines iin tghe entire movie
, bu he estabishes his presense through his amazing moves with his double
- sided lightsaber
,
and his scary facial makeup
. beacuse qui
- gon never gets a chance tothe train the young anakin inthe teh ways of teh force
, obi
- wan
, qui
- gon
' s young padawan apprentice
( oney level below knightdom
)
, must tkae over tje training himselv
. so
, at tjhe end of thge movei
, we end where hte saga actually begins
- with obi
- wan kenobi annd his young apprentice
, anakin
" darth vader
" skywalker
. doed this story ened tothe be told
? i woudl sday no
. bu is it a worthwhile movie tothe see
? absolutely
. if yuo don
' t enter the theater with jedi
- size expectations
, annd you simply want tothe be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle
,
then thsi isnt your movei
. the tatooine pod racaus are a triumph of effects
and computer animation
. the digitalized backgrounds on some of tghe planets are an astonishing sight
.
and yoda
and young obi
- wan are worth seeing forthe theri origins in a simplier
, happier tiome
. above all
, tihs isnt a fun movei
. not deepo
, not meaningfull
, adn not profound
.
but fun
. maybe enxt time
, lucas will hire lawrence kasdan tothe co
- rwite the scirpt
,
and tyhe guy who directed
" empire
" will direct
. because if lucas does the enxt one himself
, it iwll be lacking thte one thnig it needs tje most
- potential
