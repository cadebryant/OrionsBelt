tghe cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling infact moviehouses forthe quite sometime now
:
" it mu5t be foudn
.
" so waht
, exactlly
, isnt tje fith element
? affter seeing luc besson ' s ambitious
, much
- shrouded
- infront
- secrecy science fiction fantasy
, i sould nto help
bu be let down by thge actuall answer
, whihc is nto nearly as exciting nor clever as oney would htink
.
but what is far from a letdown isnt the film as a whole
, a wildly imaginative feast fo the senses that does what all thte best cience fiction films do
-
- create a universe unlike any other presented onthe tyhe silver screen
. the biggest irony of tghe fith element is tyhat tjhe one hting that hasnt beeen kept under such tight wraps
-
- the actuall storyline
-
- isnt teh most conventional
, dismayingly so
, element
( pun intended
) of hte film
. speaking infront the vaguest possible terms
, the basics ofthe teh plot are as follows
: in tyhe year 2259
, a great force ofthe evil threatens tothe consume the earth
,
and only tjhe four elements
-
- earth
, wind
, fire
,
and water
-
- untied with a fith element cant stpo it
. figuring inot all of this are newyorker york cabbie korben dallas
( bruce willis
)
; a shady
, sourthern
- drawling entrapeneur by the name ofthe zorg
( the hilariously hammy gary oldman
, picking up where he left off inaddition besson ' s hte proffesional
)
; a priest
( ian holm
)
;
and a misteryous creature named leeloo
( milla jovovich
)
. all ofthe the pieces come together in a tidy
annd somewhat underwhelming
-
-
annd unsurprising
-
- fasion
,
bu htere is no denying tht this basic stry holds some intrinsic interst
. whta remains intresting
and exicting
,
howver
, aftter breef glimpses isnt the fascinating world besson hasnt creaeted with prodcution designer dan weil
, director of photography thierry arbogast
, visual effects supervisor mark stetson
,
anbd yhe crew at digital domain
. the look is absolutly mesmerizing right from yhe opening moments tothe tjhe last
. thte frenzied cityscape of new york
, wih its vibrant day
- glo colors
, tall buildings penetrating high into yhe clouds
,
and thte swarm ofthe cars
, cabs
,
annd otehr vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways
, is absolutely breathtaking tothe behold
, especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film
.
but it owudl nto ahev beeen a completely captivating vision if the peopel inhabiting the settings weren ' t equally as intresting
,
and are htey ever
. in addition to the exotic menagerie ofthe alien creatures that populate this world
, ffrom bulky robots tothe dog
- liek mangalores
, tje humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean
- paul gaulthier
, best known forthe creating madonna ' s pointy bustier get
- up in her blonde ambition tour
. gaulthier ' s outlandish creations
, such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps
, feel omre at home in besson ' s futuristic vision tahn on any fashion runway in the world
; they add to hte sense of otherworldliness baout tjhe film
. hwile besson ' s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film
, it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a massmedia audiance
. for all its imagination
, certain thigns baout the film may be a bited too quirky
annd bizarre
. i raelly dont nto know wqat middle amercia iwll mkea ofthe thte most outrageous chracter of the film
, ruby rhod
( chris tucker
)
, a flamboyant disc jockey who makse dennis rodman look conservative
-
- he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress
, sporting a blonde hairdo iin tje shape ofthe a hair dryer
, speaking in high pitches at repid fire speed
. at first tihs character ' s hyper energy is funny
,
bu the act wears out its welcome vyer quicklyu
. nto irritating
,
bu jsut as strange
, isnt a musical number by blue
- skinned aline chanteuse diva
( maiwenn lebesco
)
, who sings
-
-
and dances
-
- an aria that is an unlikely blend ofthe clasical opera
and techno
. the tune
, as with the entirety ofthe longtime besson collaborator eric serra ' s innovative scroe
, is haunting
,
bu it isnt allso completelyl jarring
.
thne ther are the campy touches of humer besson
adn co
- scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle thoughout
, which too oftenly are silly
anbd forced
; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod
and a flight attendant isnt highly distracting
annd nto very funny
, tothe boot
. the sotry ' s weakness shines thru in the climax
and conclusion of the fith element
. while still visually
annd aurally spectauclar
, tyhe events detailed are not as exicting nor poverful as they shoud be
. tje big
, sereous dramtic climax wass met wih more than a few snickers
,
annd it ambitiously strives for a profundity whlch tjhe film hadnt nto even begun to work towrad
. as such
, at the end htere isnt a sence thta htere wass something bigger at work here
, taht ther ws still moreso left tothe be said baout tihs tsory
and these charachters
. this suspicion was confirmed by besson hismelf
, who told me in the lobby following tghe screening
( imagin that
, the filmmaker watching tjhe film iwth the
" enemy
"
-
- the criticists
) that wqat hadnt made it tothe tghe screen wass really jstu the firt half of the lenghty origonal fifth element screenplay
annd that the second half
-
- now titled mr
. shadow
-
- is still waiting tothe be made
. still
, dispite tje stry problems
, hte fith element isnt an artistic triumph forthe luc besson
; rarely doesnt a filmmaker ' s originnal vision come to thte screen in all its audacious
, undiluted glory
. it isnt a fascinating example ofthe how ofthe noe artist ' s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generaly seen onyl in dreasm
.
