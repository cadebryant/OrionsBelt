tjhe cryptic teaser trailer hasnt been unspooling in moviehouses for qtuie sometime nowe
:
" it mu5t be found
.
" so what
, exactlly
, is thge fith element
? after seing luc besson
' s ambitious
, much
- shrouded
- in
- secrecy science fiction fantasy
, i sould not halp bu be let down by tyhe actuall answer
, hwihc is not nearly as exicting nor clever as oney owudl thiunk
. bu whta isnt far from a letdown isnt tyhe film as a hwole
, a wildly imaginative faest forthe hte senses that doens what all the best science fiction films do
-
- create a universe unlike any otehr presented onthe teh silver screen
. tghe biggest irony ofthe hte fifth element isnt that the one thing taht hasnt beeen kept under such tight wraps
-
- the actuall storyline
-
- isnt teh most convetional
, dismayingly so
, element
( pun intended
) ofthe thge film
. speaking inaddition tjhe vaguest possible terms
, tje basics of the plot are as follows
: inaddition the year 2259
, a grat force ofthe evil threatens to consume the earth
, anbd only the four elements
-
- earth
, wind
, fier
,
and water
-
- united withthe a fifth element cxan stpo it
. figuring into all ofthe this are new york cabbie korben dallas
( bruce willis
)
; a shady
, southern
- drawling entrepeneur by teh nmae of zorg
( the hilariously hammy gary oldman
, picking uv where he left off in besson
' s the professional
)
; a priest
( ian holm
)
;
and a mysterious creature named leeloo
( milla jovovich
)
. all ofthe the pieces come toghether inthe a tidy adn somewhat underwhelming
-
-
and unsuprising
-
- fasion
, bu htere is no denying that this basic stry holds some intrinsic interest
. what remeniss interesting adn exciting
, howver
, after breif glimpses isnt thge fascinating world besson hasnt created with prodcution designer dan weil
, director of photography thierry arbogast
, visual effects supervisor mark stetson
,
and the crew at digital domain
. the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from tje opening moments tothe tghe last
. teh frenzied cityscape of new york
, wtih its vibrant day
- glo colors
, tall buildings penetrating high inot tyhe clouds
,
and teh swarm ofthe cars
, cabs
, annd other vehicles flying thru labyrinthian skyways
, is absolutly breathtaking to behold
, especialy in a wild car chase sequence early on in yhe film
. bu it owudl nto ahev been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren
' t equally as intresting
, adn are htey ever
. inthe addtion tothe the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world
, fomr bulky robots tothe dog
- like mangalores
, tyhe humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean
- paul gaulthier
, best known for creating madonna
' s pointy bustier get
- up inaddition her blonde ambition tour
. gaulthier
' s outl
andish creations
, such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely outloud of white straps
, efel moreso at hmeo infact besson
' s futuristic vision thna on any fashon runway inspite tje world
; htey add to the sence of otherworldliness baout thte film
. hwile besson
' s bold vision is the biggest virtue ofthe the film
, it also could be its biggest obsticle tothe reacing a mass audience
. for all its immagination
, certian things about yhe film may be a bit too quirky annd bizzare
. i relaly dont nto nkow what middle amercia will amking ofthe thte most outrageous character of hte film
, ruby rhod
( chris tucker
)
, a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservitive
-
- he makse a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress
, sporting a blonde hairdo iin the shape of a hair dryer
, speaking inwhich high pitches at rapid fire speed
. at first this charater
' s hyper energy isnt funny
, bu tyhe ect wears outloud its welcome vyer quicklyu
. nto irritating
,
but just as stange
, isnt a muscial number by blue
- skinned alien chanteuse diva
( maiwenn lebesco
)
, who sings
-
- adn dances
-
- an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera
and techno
. the tune
, as wih thge entirety ofthe longtime besson collaborator eric serra
' s inovative csore
, is haunting
, bu it isnt also completely jarring
.
then htere are yhe campy touches of humor besson anbd co
- scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout
, which too often are silly anbd forced
; a comic sexual encounter beetwen ruby rhod
and a flight attendent is highly distracting annd nto veyr funny
, to boot
. the story
' s weakness shines through inaddition tghe climax
and conclusion of teh fith element
. while still visually anbd aurally spectacular
, thte events detailled are nto as exicting nor poweful as they shoud be
. hte big
, sereous dramtic climax was met wih moreso than a few snickers
, anbd it ambitiously strives for a profundity whic the film had not even begun tothe work toward
. as such
, at the end ther is a sense that ther wass something bigger at work here
, tyhat htere was still more left tothe be said baout thsi story annd theese characters
. htis suspision ws confirmed by besson himself
, who told me inaddition tjhe lobby following the screening
( imagine that
, the filmmaker watching yhe film withthe the
" enemy
"
-
- the critics
) thgat what hadnt made it to thte screen wass really jsut tjhe first half ofthe tghe lenghty originnal fith element screenplay
and tath the second half
-
- now titled mr
. shadow
-
- is still waiting to be made
. still
, despite the story problems
, the fifth element isnt an artistic triumph fo luc besson
; rarely does a filmmaker
' s original vision cmo tothe the screen infact all its audacious
, undiluted glory
. it isnt a fascinating example of how ofthe one artist
' s fervid immagination cxan transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generaly seen onyl in dreasm
.
