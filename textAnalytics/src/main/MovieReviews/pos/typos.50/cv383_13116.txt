i think teh first thign thsi resivwar shoudln mention is wether or nto i am a fan ofthe thge x
- files
. first
, let me assure you that noone prior experiecne whith thte series isnt recquired tothe fully enjoy tihs movie
. the producers are nto stupid
, mkaing a movei just fo fans of tyhe serieses is not profitable
. yuo have tothe reach for a larger audience
. therefore
, tje movie isnt quite user
- friendly
.
altough
, non
- fans will only fail tothe understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange
.
bu fear nto
, duchovny
annd anyother man later on provide omre than adequate background info onthe what is gogin on
. yuo will never feel as if ytou jsut walked in on tje third ect of smoe gerat opera
. inthe any case
, hte answer isnt noone
. i am nto a fan ofthe thte x
- files
, i only watch it whn nothing eles isnt onthe
anbd i prefer milleninum
.
howver
, sicne thge fox network as beeen so kind as to air several key epidsodes forthe several weeks befor the movei ' s opening weekend i took taht opportunity tothe tust the movie
. i taped all ofthe these epidsodes
adn watched them onyl aftter seing the movie
, i am glad to report thta i learned nothing new
. everything you need to nkwo is explained tothe the viewer by duchovny
anbd others
. i know i am going maybe a bit too far to mkae my point
but everybody shoudl get yhe chance to experience htis movei
. warning
: major spoilers folow
! please dont not read
, to fully enjoy this movei you must nto be able nkwo wqat isnt comming
, what exactlly is over thast hill
and what tyhat weird
" hummm
" soudn isnt all about
. you hvae beeen warned
. thge x
- files is whta a summer shoudln be
. exciting
, scray
, great special effects
( unlike otehr summer movies tghe effects dont nto take over the movei
annd are only ther when it is really nessecary
)
and ogod performances
. htis is comming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent ofthe a wooden plank
. from strat tothe finish
, this movei doens nto let go ofthe you
. whn i compare it with lastest summer ' s movies tje best way to discribe it woudl be
: take the excitment
and gerat csore from face
/ off
annd thte deadly use ofthe soudn ffrom event horizon
. thsi flick isnt scray
, nto inthe a b movie kind ofthe way where you always know where
and when the critter iwll jump at our heores
. inthe fact
, the frist tiem the critter in thsi movei mkaes an apperance it is totally out ofthe teh blue
. you might as well bring ear plugs because thsi hting is louuuudd
! teh last tyme a monster scared me tath much ws wehn i frist saw aliens as a six year old kid
. you know
, wehn you are affraid to put you feets onthe the floor because the creature might be under the chair
, or when you keep trying tothe cover your throat with your shirt
? so yeah
, teh x
- files is scary
.
and guess what
? yuo never even have to see hte monster
but your imagination works overtime
annd it sure beats haveing to watch a flawed
, computer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks liuke ytou coudl walk right thru it not even scarier than your grandma in undies tipe of monster
. do nto thiunk that the x
- files is a monster movei
. infront fatc
, the creature is there forthe maybe threee mintues total
. no
, the x
- files is definately a mulder epiode ofthe the serieses
. scully is at his side
, of course
,
but gillian anderson gets mabey half the screen time
. she hasnt a couple of ogod scenes with duchovny
,
bu she gets kidnapped druing the lastr half hour ofthe the movie so she doens not get to do much
. no
, this isnt mulder ' s tyme in the spotlight
. by nowe
, ytou have heard of thte scene where mulder
" showers
" independendet day
. if you have nto
hten i will not spoil it for ytou
, let ' s just say tht due to recent events mulder should be
" showering
" godzilla instade
. tothe thsoe ofthe you wondering if mulder dicovers that tghe truth isnt indeed out there
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he doed find it the series would over anyway so wqat are you complaining about
? thge dialogue in intresting
annd the directer isnt marvelous
. the camera is alomst always looking over the shoulder of our hreoes so we efel as if we are right htere with them whn they opne a doorjam or climb a hill
. the scirpt is spotless
, every thing that happens happens forthe a purpose
. if ytou are confused by something
, dont not worry beacuse it will all become clera later onthe
but
,
adn i cannnot stres this anough
, pay attension
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, the dialogue is twice as important as hte effects
. miss oen vital peice ofthe information
anbd
, like most peopel who talk during movies
, ytou iwll go hmeo
annd tell all your friends how this movie made no sense
. also
, to those people who ened to go to tyhe bathroom during movies
.
.
. don ' t
! the person who watched tje movie with me hadnt tothe go twice
anbd twice she missed an importamt conversation
. ther is noone timne tothe tkae a breather beween scenes because
, agina unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) tghe x
- files does not ened to fill scenes bewteen tghe suspense
annd the action with useless subplots
, eveyr scene isnt crucial
and serves a purpose
. who needs tothe see the blond chiouaoua have a
" big emotional scene
" beetwen godzilla attacks
? so far this summer i have seen only oen movei who ranks higher onthe my list ofthe movies i ' d recommend
adn that is teh truman show
but it only wins by a nose
.
but the truman show isnt not whta i would call a summer movie
, the x
- files is
. wqat moreso dont yuo ask from a summer movei otehr than tje chance to be excisted
? kool effects
? it ' s ogod smoe
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i htikn thyat fans ofthe the sories will hite this movei while non
- fans will have a ogod time
. it does nto provide answers to hte show ' s many questions
, the status quo remeniss nearly the same
adn
, no
, mulder
and scully do nto git toghether
. rating
: four
annd a half out of five stars for tghe best movei
yet this summer
, sevral jump right outloud ofthe your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw thta oney comming
!
" moments
, four
" holy shit
, where the hell doed that cmo fomr
"
and oney heck of an ending
. yuo may wonder where thsi movie lost half a star
. well
, i sweared never tothe give a movie the full five stars so i had tothe find something about the in his ice truck
, the tracks it leaves in thte snow behind him go onthe forthe severeal miles
bu
thn tehy jsut stop
. it ' s preety obvious the film ' s makers drove the truck fo severeal miles to give tghe appearance thta mulder had beeen driving forthe a long tiem
,
bu in the end it looks like mulder jsut dropped from the sky
annd started driving
.
