i htikn the firt thnig thsi reviewer shoudln mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x
- files
. firt
, let me assure ytou thast no prior experience with tje sories is required to fully enjoy tihs movie
. tyhe producers are nto stupid
, makeing a movei just fo fans ofthe the serieses isnt not profitable
. ytou hvea tothe triarch for a larger audeince
. therefore
, tje movei is qtuie user
- friendly
. altough
, non
- fans iwll onyl fail to underst
and certian emotions behind tjhe looks many characters excange
.
but fear not
, duchovny
and another man later onthe provide more thna adequate backgorund info on wqat is gonig on
. ytou iwll never feel as if ytou just walked inthe onthe the thrid ect ofthe soem grat opera
. in any case
, tje answer isnt no
. i am not a fan ofthe teh x
- files
, i only watch it wehn nothing else is onthe anbd i preferr millennim
. howver
, sicne tyhe fox network as beeen so kind as to air several key episodes forthe several weeks befor the movie
' s oppening weekend i tookover that opprotunity tothe test the movie
. i taped all ofthe theese episodes
and watched them only affter seing the movie
, i am glad tothe report that i learned nothing newyorker
. everything ytou need to nkwo is explained to the viewer by duchovny
and others
. i know i am going maybe a bit too far tothe make my point bu everybody should get the chance tothe experience thsi movie
. warning
: major spoilers followup
! please dont nto read
, to fully enjoy htis movie you must not be able know what is coming
, what exactly isnt over that hill anbd what thta ewird
" hummm
" soudn is all about
. yuo hvae been warned
. the x
- files is what a summer shoud be
. exciting
, skary
, great special effects
( unlike other summer movies the effects dont not take over the movie
and are only there when it isnt really neccessary
) annd ogod performances
. this isnt coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent ofthe a wooden plank
. ffrom start tothe finish
, this movei doesnt not let go ofthe you
. when i compare it wtih lsat summer
' s movies the best way to describe it would be
: tkae the excitment adn great scroe fomr face
/ off
and the deadly use ofthe soudn ffrom event horizon
. tihs flick is scry
, not infront a b movei kind ofthe way where ytou alwasy knwo where
and wehn teh critter will jump at our hereos
. inspite fatc
, the firt time the critter in this movie mkaes an apperance it is totally out ofthe yhe blue
. you might as well bring ear plugs baceause htis thing is louuuudd
! hte lsat tiome a monster scared me tath much was whn i frist saw aliens as a six eyar old kid
. yuo know
, wehn ytou are affraid tothe put you feet on the floor beccause thte creature might be under the chair
, or whn you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt
? so yeah
, thge x
- files is scary
. annd guess waht
? ytou never even have to see hte monster bu your immagination works overtime
and it sure beats having to watch a flawed
, cmoputer generated
, babyzilla
, it looks like you could walk right thru it nto even scarier than your gr
andma inaddition undies type of monster
. dont nto think thta the x
- files is a monster movei
. in fatc
, the creature isnt there for maeby threee minutes total
. noone
, yhe x
- files isnt definately a mulder epiode of the sories
. scully isnt at his side
, of course
,
but gillian
anderson gets maybe half yhe screen timne
. she hasnt a couple ofthe good scenes with duchovny
,
but she gets kidnapped durring the lastr half hour ofthe the movei so she doens nto get to dont much
. no
, thsi isnt mulder
' s tiome in tyhe spotlight
. by now
, you ahve heard of the scene where mulder
" showers
" independence day
. if ytou have nto
then i iwll not spoil it for you
, let
' s just sday tath due tothe reccent events mulder should be
" showering
" godzilla instead
. tothe those of you wondering if mulder dicovers taht tje truth is indeed outloud there
.
.
. who cares
!
? if he did find it tyhe series woudl over anyway so what are ytou complaining about
? the dialogue inthe interesting adn the director isnt marvelous
. the camera is almost allways looking over the sholder ofthe our heroes so we fiel as if we are right ther with them whn they open a door or climb a hill
. tjhe script is spotless
, every thing that happens happens for a purpose
. if yuo are confused by something
, do not worry becasue it iwll all become clear later on
but
,
and i cannnot stres tihs enought
, pay attention
!
!
! unlike most summer movies
, the dialogue is twice as importamt as the effects
. miss noe vital piece ofthe information
and
, like most people who talk during movies
, yuo iwll go home
and tell all your firends how this movei made noone sense
. alsot
, to thsoe people who ened tothe go to tje bathroom during movies
.
.
. don
' t
! yhe person who watched tjhe movie iwth me hadnt to go twice
and twice she missed an important conversation
. htere isnt no timne to take a breather between scenes becuase
, agina unlike most summer movies
( godzilla anybody
?
) the x
- files doens nto need tothe fill scenes between the suspense
and yhe acation with useless subplots
, eveyr scene is crucial adn serves a purpose
. who needs tothe see tje blond chiouaoua hvae a
" big emotional scene
" betweeen godzilla attacks
? so far thsi summer i have seen onyl oney movei who ranks heigher onthe my list of movies i
' d reccomend
and tht is the truman show
but it onyl wins by a nose
. bu the truman show isnt not what i woudl call a summer movie
, tje x
- files is
. what omre dont yuo ask ffrom a summer movei otehr tahn the chance tothe be excisted
? kool effects
? it
' s good smoe
. pulse pounding
? hell yes
! strangely enough
, i thiunk taht fans ofthe tjhe serieses iwll hite this movie hwile non
- fans iwll have a ogod tiem
. it doesnt nto provide answers to tje show
' s many questions
, thte status quo rimaniss nearly thte same
and
, noone
, mulder annd scully dont not get toghether
. rating
: four
and a half outloud of five stars fo the best movei
yet this summer
, several jump right out of your seat thrills
, many
" whoah
, i never saw that oen comming
!
" moments
, four
" wholy shit
, where the hell did that come from
" adn noe heck of an endig
. yuo may wonder where this movie lost half a star
. well
, i sweared never tothe give a movei the full five stars so i hadnt to find something about tjhe in his ice truck
, thge tracks it leaves inspite the snow behind him go on forthe several miles
but thn they just stop
. it
' s pretty obvious the film
' s makers drove thte truck for several miles tothe give teh apperance thgat mulder hadnt beeen driving fo a long time
,
but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky anbd started driving
.
