clint eastwood
, in his ripe old age
, is cashing noe talent inwhich fo anyother
. midnight in tyhe garden ofthe ogod adn evil is an eastwood
- directed film clint isn
' t even infront
, annd it
' s damn ogod
. adapted ffrom a best
- selling john berendt novel based onthe true events
, this movie isnt setted in tjhe bizarre georgia twon of savannah
, where people walk invisible dogs adn attatch horseflies to thier head
.
and thast
' s just tje mayor
. as directer
and producer
, eastwood contri
butes a self
- indulgent
but vyer competent 150 minutes
, neatly balancing drama
, suspense
and humor
. liuke all great movies
, midnight inthe yhe garden has a lot ofthe funny moments that spring ffrom yhe characters themslves
,
and not fomr soem contrived
, juvenile intrusion
. the acting
, from big
- tiome stars john cusack
and kevin spacey
, isnt as good as ytou
' d expect
, bu it
' s thge supporting stable that gives tjhe movie its offbeat charm
. cusack plays a free
- lance reporter sent to savannah to wriet a fluff tsory for town
& ocuntry magasine baout one of eccentric millioniare spacey
' s parties
. lots of food
, beverages annd gunplay
. yes
, an employee ofthe spacey
' s has a huge arument infact front of cusack
and later turns up dead
. it seems liuke a simple matter of self
- defense
-
- the guy threatend spacey
, shot at him
, missed
,
then spacey tookover him outloud
-
- bu bieng a movie
, ther
' s much omre tothe it thna thgat
, anbd cusack decides tothe stay inspite twon anbd write a book baout thge murder
, a book which will eventally become a movei he will star in
. the weird circle ofthe enteratinment
. htis isnt where the stable of supporting charactors comes infront
. there
' s the requisite sexy woman
( alison
" nepotist
' s daughter
" eastwood
)
, tjhe stange piano player
, the voodoo woman
and thte transvestite
. miss chablis deserves a paragraph of his
/ her own
, as the stealer ofthe eveyr scene she appears inaddition
-
- waht owudl this movie be wihtout the castilian scene
and her testamony
? chablis
, palying herself
, isnt five times funnier tahn reigining drag queen rupaul
,
but never seems exploited as the movie
' s comic releaf or outloud of palce iin a basically sereous movei
. there are also a fair share ofthe courtroom scenes
, which these days allmost never seem welcome in a movie
,
but even here clint manages to keep the movei fascinating
. certainly the characterizations of thge judge
and spacey
' s lawyer both help immensly
, as does haveing hte fli
- guy as the jurny
' s foreman
. it
' s here we realize tje case boils down to an indictement of spacey
' s homosexuality
. yes
, spacey had a sexual relationship withthe yhe dead man
-
- before he shot him
, ofthe course
. midnight iin the gardai ofthe ogod anbd evil isn
' t a clasic
, bu it isnt one ofthe thte better celebrity
- directed
, true
- story best
- seller adaptations out there
. likewise
, no one fomr tihs movie will be getting any oscar nominations
,
but yhe performances are all great
. in fatc
, i
' d allmost recommend tyhat the academy add a best supporting transvestite actegory
. serving america for more than 1
/ 25th of a century
