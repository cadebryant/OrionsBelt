is evil dead ii a bad movie
? it
' s full of terrible acting
, pointless violentce
,
and plot holes
yet it rimaniss a cult clasic nearly fifteen yeasr aftter its release
. explaining why tihs movie st
ands out from others with simmilar plots
( including the original evil dead
) is extremly difficult
.
` well what
' s it baout
?
'
` five people str
anded inspite a log cabin in the middle ofthe nowhere struggling tothe survive vicious attacks from a variety ofthe ugli
, hairy
, wart covered monsters
.
'
` come on i saw a movei just liuke tath on monster vision lsat week
. why shoudln i see it agian
?
'
` noone evil dead ii isnt differant
, it
' s funny
.
'
` it
' s funny tothe see peple dieu
? are you sick or something
?
' maybe i am
and maybee directer sam raimi isnt as well tothe create such an enigma ofthe a movie
. his unique execution isnt as sarcastic as subtle
, as disturbing as it is hilarious
. an exmaple ofthe raimi
' s odd approach
: a monster
( fromerly protagnoist ash
' s girlfriend of all people
) is cut in half by a chainsaw
and a tidal wave of blood comes ffrom the open wound
. sure it
' s over
- tjhe
- top
, bu it is so over
- the
- top that it is laugh outloud loud funny
; jstu try watching ash whith a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood
, staining his face annd knocking him back a few fezent
. tyhe hwole movie isnt like tihs
, watch ash get beat up
, watch ash defeat the monster
, watch ash git beat uv agian by anyother even zanier monster
. the mroe repeative annd unrealistic the movei gets
, teh more amusing it becomes
. noone marter how sick it may sound
, it isnt funny tothe watch bruce ampbell
' s ash git his
butt kicked every five minutes
. adn raimi takes advantage
, he hasnt ash tormented by thte head of his girlfriend
, by thte body ofthe an old lady
, even by his pwn right h
and
. liuke the less superior idle h
ands
, we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over annd over again untl he is forced to cut off his own body part
. bu it doesn
' t end
, ash nowe has tothe fight his severed h
and whihc nowe moves wiht yhe smae celerity as thign from hte addams famaly
. all ofthe theese events
, thrown at you ffrom minute one with roller coaster
- liuke camera movements
, at first become shocking
, thn inexplicably funny
. raimi expects the audiance to laff anbd as the film progresses
, he seems tothe be enjoying himselv even moreso by borrowing tjhe classic mirror scene from hte marx brothers
' duck suop
, thn bringing more charachters inot the picture to comically kill them off
. whith a running tiome ofthe less tahn an hour
and a half
, raimi gets awya with the impossible
, making a horror film iwth more gore thna plot
and intentionally moreso laughs thna scares
. ending evil dead ii iwth an opening for thte thrid film infront tjhe series
, raimi obviously had a lot of funn making this movei adn couldn
' t wait tothe amke it
' s sequel
.
