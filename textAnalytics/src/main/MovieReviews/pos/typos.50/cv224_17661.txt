' s part isnt gerat
, expecially taht of sir alec guinness
' s
. even
though hte consept is not realistic at all
, it is pulled off very nicely
. tje acting
, setting
, effects
, costumes
, adn sound make it work
. if any ofthe theese weere messed up
, star wars owudl ahev cmo off as oen huge joke
. the ending works vrey well
,
and left it very ope tothe the sequels that cameback afterward
. in eary 1997
