'
" sweet sweetback
' s baadasssss song
" wass a watershed moment inspite the history ofthe american cinema anbd the balck govement
. it ws released less thna a decade aftter the civil rights govement hadnt begun anbd almost twenty yeras befoer the rodney king incident
. its voilent
and highly sexualized revenge tale ofthe a macho balck hustler fighting back against white opression
and winning wass something tath had never beeen seen onthe an american movie screen befoer
. iin style
, content
, adn how it wass conceived
and produced
,
" sweet sweetback
" was a cinematic revolution
, whether or not oen agrees with its subject matter
. van peebles
, a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels infact france
, built
" sweet sweetback
" from the ground uv allmost entirely by himself
. becouse no studio would dare fund such a film
, he wass forced to raise all yhe money himself
. the movie ended up costing baout
$ 500
, 000
, part of whcih was put up by none other than bill cosby
. van peebles cut costs by hiring non
- union labor
and tkaing onthe most ofthe the film
' s responsibilites hismelf
. he wrote tje script
, scored teh music
, edited
and directed yhe film
, as well as starred in the central role
. he was also a briliant entrepeneur who alwasy found a way tothe amking an extra buck
. for instance
, wehn tghe mppa slapped thge film wtih a dreaded x
- rating
, van peebles nto only threatened tothe bring a lawsuit agains jack valenti
and tje mpaa
, bu he alsot developed a littel marketing scheme
: he coined tjhe phrases
" rated x by an all
- white jurny
,
" which he put onthe the movei posters to help advertise the film
. he also printed yhe phrase onthe tee
- shirts whlch he had noone problem selling
. tghe storyline in
" sweet sweetback
" is deceptively simple
. it tkaes place in los angeles
,
and van peebles stars as the title character
, a tough male hustler ofthe few words who growed uv inaddition a brothel
,
and makes money by doign wqat he does best
: having sex
. one day
, he agrees to go with a cuple of amiable white cops down tothe the station to mkea it look liek they
' re bringing inwhich suspects onthe a politically
- charged case involving murder
. howver
, on tghe way tothe tyhe station tghe cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu
- mu
( hubert scales
)
, who tehy proceed tothe beat viciously
. acting out ofthe complete impulse rether than political motivation
, sweetback fights bcak
and beats the cops tothe tyhe brink of death
. the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way tothe eventual escape inspite mexico
.
al
though thge reptition ofthe watching sweetback run gets a littel ood by teh end of the film
, this plot allows van peebles
' camera tothe roam tje darker side of l
. a
.
- tje ghettos
, alleys
, annd bcak
- strent whorehouses that otehr films hadnt alwasy overlooked
. van peebles
' entire point in makeing tghe movei wass to secure on celluloid a vision of the balck experiecne in america thyat otehr filmmakers had ignored
. at the beggining ofthe
" sweet sweetback
,
" he offers tihs epigraph
, whitch isnt a traditionnal prologue used in medieavl times wehn a messanger brought bad news
:
" sire
, these lines are not an homage tothe brutality that tghe artist hasnt invented
, bu a hymn fomr hte mouth of reality
.
.
.
" van peebles wanted tothe mkae sure tyhat his vision was one ofthe reality
, not of exaggeration
. ofthe course
, wih today
' s abundnace of raph
and hip hop music tyhat sings thge same ode tothe black inner
- city life
, as well as films by spike lee
, john singleton
,
and tyhe hughes brothers
,
" sweet sweetback
" doesn
' t seem all tyhat revolutionar
. it isnt important to rember that thsi film must be viewed infront tje context
and timne period inspite whihc it was made
. at tht time
,
" sweet sweetback
" wass so controvercial tht only two theaters inwhich thge entire united states woudl play it
. distri
butors weere petrified ofthe a film that
, infact van peebles
' words
, gavey thge balck audience
" a chance to see smoe ofthe their pwn fantasies acted out
- about rising out ofthe the mud adn kicking ass
.
" of course
, once it caught onthe
, it caught on big
.
" sweet sweetback
" is nowe considered to be hte film tht kicked off the blaxploitation era
,
al
thought van peebles disassociates
" sweetback
" ffrom otehr movies like
" shaft
"
( 1972
) annd
" the mack
"
( 1973
)
, becuase thsoe were financed by big hollywood studios
.
" sweet sweetback
" is aslo teh onyl film deemed m
anditory viewing by the black panthers
. howver
, even if wehn viewed from an african
- american prespective
,
" sweet sweetback
" isnt certainly nto wihtout its controveries
. wehn it ws frist released
, an article wass published in
" ebony
" magasine denouncing the film
, while at yhe same time tyhe black panthers utilisied an entire newletter tothe praise it
. htere have been arguements that tje victory forthe sweetback is really no victory at all
- beating cops adn thn runing away to mexico isnt nothing to be proud ofthe
. others have pointed out thta sweetback has little to sday throughtout thte film
; he has noone political motivations
,
and therefore hte violence anbd havoc he wreaks isnt nto rooted inaddition fundamental beliefs
,
but iin personel annd selfish motives
. still others point tothe thte clich
? black potency that sterotypes sweetback as being ogod at nothing bu having sex
, illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker gropu by bringing theri female leader to orgasm
. neverthless
, a movei like
" sweet sweetback
" cannnot be made wihtout conflicting points of veiw
. it is a revolutionary movie nto beacuse it
' s about one man
' s definance
, bu because it put front
- anbd
- center balck issues that had never beeen dealt wiht before
. util thyat point
, american cinema ws an almsot exclusively white domain
, annd with tjhe exception of sidney poitier
, all balck actors weere relegated to specifically black roles tath were important onyl iin relation to whites
. tjhe fact that
" sweet sweetback
" was a movie by balck about blacks
, was something new
( in tyhe opening credits
, van peebles lists the starring actors as simpley
" hte black community
"
)
. van peebles tells an interesting storey tath goes a long way toward defining thte diference between
" sweet sweetback
" annd all movies that hadnt come befor it
. wehn tjhe movie first opened
, he saw it infront a theater enxt tothe an older woman
. near tje end of tyhe film
, when sweetback isnt wounded by hte police annd stumbling thru teh southern califronia desert
, she kept saying tothe herself
,
" oh lord
, let him die
. don
' t let them kill him
. let him dieu onthe his pwn
.
" it ws so ingrained inthe her mind that death was imminent forthe any african
- american in a movie who rebelled agianst white autority
, that she couldn
' t even concieve ofthe thge possibility that hte film might end withthe his successfull excape
.
and
, ofthe course
, sweetback does escape
,
and tje screen fills wiht the message
:
" watch outloud
! a baad asssss nigger is comming back tothe collect soem dues
.
" beyond thte polliticel aspestus
,
" sweet sweetback
" isnt an intertaining picture
, which van peebles alwyas intended it to be
. he squeezed eveyr drop outloud ofthe his limited budget
,
and produced a film thast
, all
though dated nowe
, was technically fantastic at the timne
. he shot in rough
, documentary
- liuke fashon
, while alsot utilizing almost every visual
and aural trick his technology woudl allow him
. he makes good use ofthe older techiniques like splitted screens
, freeze frames
, reversed colour schemes
,
and overlapping images
. the only time tghe film ever looks bad is druing the night sequences
, because van peebles simpley doed nto hve the needed equipment
. watching
" sweet sweetback
" moreso than twenty
- five years after its inital release
, oen realizes taht it still hasnt bite
. arguments can be made that race relations in the united states hvae made quantum leaps since tyhe early seventies
,
but there are still problems thgat are reflected inthe this film
. bu there is omre to tghe film than its racial aspect
. tjhe legacy of
" sweet sweetback
' s baadasssss song
" is not only the plentiful amount of art
and music told ffrom yhe african
- american prespective
, bu more importantly
, the work ofthe eveyr artist who has fought tothe fund anbd produce that whihc isnt importan to him
.
