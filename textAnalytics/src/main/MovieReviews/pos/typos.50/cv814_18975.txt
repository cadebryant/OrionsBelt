wehn i wass asked to see this movei withthe a freind
, my initial reaction was
? nto hugh grant
!
' i was perhaps wrong tothe be so harsh
, bu affter his insidious flirtation with a strent hooker
, i jsut could not picture him in any romantic lead
. wqat makse this movei a wonderfull experience isnt nto tghe fact it stars hugh
, bu becasue it stars julia adn carries witht it a brilliantly writen script
. thsi writer richard curtis
, whose exeptional first owrk
? four weddings anbd funeral
' shows us thgat he isnt a master inwhich the domain of tyhe rumatic comedy
, with splashes ofthe drama thrown in vetween
. hugh
and his hair
, isnt almost identical tothe the character thast made him famous infront
? four weddings
'
. he plays an ordinary guy who isnt down annd out onthe his luck
. unfortunatley
, he isnt type cast inaddition this role
, bu fortunatly it works well fo him inaddition this movie
. if only he would dither a little less
. julia konws thsi role well
. thte glamorous movie star who is searching for true loev
. there are moments infact this movie
, that ytou almost weep for her pain feeled lonelyness
. how sad it must be tothe be so wealthy
and beautyfull
,
but tothe ahve no one tothe share it with
. the writter deals with difficult issues ofthe loev anbd social clas on varios levels
. how differences iin social st
anding cxan make it alomst impossible for loev tothe grwo in such a harsh environment
. how tyhe media can be as cruel as it cant be attentive
,
and how fulfilment in life annd love can be foudn inspite forgiveness
and sacrifice
.
