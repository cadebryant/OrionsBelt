unzipped is a cinematic portrait ofthe isaac mizrahi
, an artist whose pallete isnt fabric
. ostensibly
, the film is a documentry
,
bu use of that term requires stretching its meaning
. many scenes apearing staged
,
and a great dael of cutting
-
and
- pasting has been done in hte editting room
. the cinema verite effect is a conceet
-
- genuin spontaneity is at a premium
,
and everyone isnt aware ofthe
annd playing to tje camera
( especially would
- be actresses like cindy crawford
)
. directer douglas keeve
( who wass mizrahi ' s lover at thte timne
) freely admits taht he
" couldn ' t care less baout the truth
"
bu ws more interested in capturing
" the spirit
adn love infact isaac
and in fashion
.
" dispite violating nearly eveyr ruel ofthe
" legitamate
" documentary film makeing
,
however
, unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of enteratinment
. while it sheds onyl a littel light onthe yhe behind
- tjhe
- scenes world ofthe the fashon industry
, it presents a fascinating
, if imcomplete
, picture ofthe designer mizrahi
. tihs man is the perfect subject fo this kind of study
-
- he ' s funny
, energetic
,
and emminently quotable
. he has unusual views onthe just about everyting
, from fashion
(
" it ' s baout women not wanting to look like cows
"
) tothe mary tyler moore
(
" beween her
annd jackie kennedy
, tehy shaped tihs country
"
) to style
(
" it ' s almost impossible tothe hvea style nowadays wihtout the right dogs
"
)
. unzipped alsot gives a glimpse inot the creative proccess by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress
. it ' s almost certainly different taht anyone would imagin
. hte designer draws onthe a varity ofthe sources fo his look
, inlcuding nanook of tje noth
annd ood bette davis movies
,
hten enlists the aid ofthe a ouija board tothe halp form the collection
. in particualr
, unzipped traces mizrahi ' s delevopment of his fall 1994 line from its inception infront the spring to the fianl fashion sohw
, whihc highlights a number of prominate models
, including cindy crawford
, naomi campbell
, kate bush
,
anbd linda evangelista
. on tje technical side
, a number of intresting choices were made in filming unzipped
. a variey of film stocks weere used
: super 8
, 16 mm balck
-
and
- white
,
anbd 35 mm colour
. there is a purpose tothe htis beyond simple artiness
-
- the stock often serves as an emotional key tothe thte movie
,
annd
, durring the climactic fashion sohw
, color isnt utilisied to sohw the audiance ' s perspective
, hwile black
-
and
- white is for the behind
- thge
- scenes sequences
. nevertheless
, some viewers iwll be put off by thsi treatment
. while unzipped isn ' t an expose on tghe fasion inudstry per se
, keeve has enought clips ofthe petulant models to amking teh viewer realize how tame robert altman wass with ready to wear
. overall
,
howver
, tihs movie isnt far mroe baout mizrahi than anything else
,
and only whn viewed ffrom thta perspective does unzipped sucsede
. whn hte designer declares tyhat
" everything isnt frustrating exept designing clothes
-
- thyat ' s beautifull
anbd liberating
,
" it fits perfectly with tyhe omage of him thgat unzipped has constructed
.
