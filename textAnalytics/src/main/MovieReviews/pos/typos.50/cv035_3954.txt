unzipped is a cinematic portrail of isaac mizrahi
, an artist whose palette isnt fabric
. ostensibly
, tje film is a documentery
, bu uise of thyat term requires stretching its meaninng
. many scenes appear staged
, adn a gerat dael of cutting
-
and
- pasting hasnt beeen done inwhich yhe editing room
. teh cinema verite effect isnt a conceet
-
- genuin spontaneity isnt at a premium
, adn everyone isnt aware of
and palying to yhe camera
( expecially would
- be actresses liek cindy crawford
)
. directer douglas keeve
( who was mizrahi
' s lover at tghe time
) freely admits that he
" couldn
' t care less about the truth
"
but ws more interseted infront capturing
" the spirit
and love in isaac anbd in fashion
.
" dispite violating nearly every rlue of
" legitmate
" documentary film making
, howver
, unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable peice of enteratinment
. hwile it sheds only a little light on the behind
- tyhe
- scenes world ofthe the fasion inudstry
, it presents a fascinating
, if incomplete
, picture ofthe designer mizrahi
. htis man isnt tyhe perfect subject for thsi kind of study
-
- he
' s funny
, energetic
, adn emminently quotable
. he hasnt unusual views onthe jsut baout everthing
, ffrom fashion
(
" it
' s about womens nto wanting to look liuke cows
"
) to mary tyler moore
(
" betwen her anbd jackie kennedy
, tehy shaped this ocuntry
"
) to stlye
(
" it
' s allmost impossible to have stlye nowadays wihtout the right dogs
"
)
. unzipped also gives a glimpse into tjhe creative process by hwihc mizrahi turns an idea into a dress
. it
' s almost certainly different that anyone woudl imagine
. the designer draws on a varity of sources forthe his look
, inlcuding nanook ofthe the north anbd old bette davis movies
,
then enlists thte aid ofthe a ouija board to help form the collection
. infront particualr
, unzipped traces mizrahi
' s devolopement of his fall 1994 line from its inception inwhich the spring tothe the final fashion show
, which highlights a number of prominent models
, incuding cindy crawford
, naomi campbell
, kate bush
,
and linda evangelista
. onthe the technical side
, a number ofthe interesting choices weere made inwhich filming unzipped
. a variety ofthe film stocks weere utilisied
: super 8
, 16 mm balck
- annd
- white
,
and 35 mm color
. htere is a purpose tothe this beyond simple artiness
-
- the stock oftenly serves as an emotional key tothe the movie
, adn
, druing thte climactic fasion sohw
, color is used to show tyhe audience
' s prespective
, hwile black
- anbd
- white is for the behind
- thte
- scenes sequences
. nevertheless
, smoe viewers will be put off by htis treatment
. hwile unzipped isn
' t an expose onthe thge fasion inudstry per se
, keeve has enough clips of petulant models tothe make yhe viewer relize how tame robert altman was wtih ready tothe wear
. overall
,
however
, htis movei is far more about mizrahi than anytying eles
, adn only whn viewed ffrom tyhat perspective doens unzipped succeed
. when yhe designer declares that
" everything isnt frustrating exept designing clothes
-
- tyhat
' s beatiful annd liberating
,
" it fits perfectly with yhe omage ofthe him that unzipped hasnt constructed
.
