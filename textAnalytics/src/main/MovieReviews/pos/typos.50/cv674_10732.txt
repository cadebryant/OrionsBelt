look back at all tyhe times in your life when ther was a fork infront thge path tothe tje future
. smoe sort ofthe decision hadnt to be made
,
and
, fo better or worse
, it irrevocably altered the course ofthe your existence
.
> from tyme
- tothe
- tyme
, everyone thinks about hte roads not taken
,
and how things might have turned outloud if tje choice had been different
. perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seamingly minor acation
-
- catching thte 10 am turain
, forthe example
-
- sould hve an equally profound
, yot less obvious
, inpact
. maybe tyhat
' s where yuo met your significant otehr
,
and
, had you reached tjhe platform just a faw seconds later
? film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny thna anyone else
, adn tyhat
' s why ther
' s noone shortage of movies baout this subject
. yhe best ofthe tjhe bunch were probably made by the late polish directer krzysztof kieslowski
, who ws obssessed with questions ofthe fate
and chance
. these themes weave their way thru many of his movies
, incuding decalogue
, the double life ofthe veronique
,
and teh triptych of blue
, white
,
and red
. howver
, tehy are most explictly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance
, where kieslowski presents thte three differnt fates ofthe one man aftter a minor action
( missing or catching a train
) changes the course of his life
. iin his autobiography
, kieslowski onthe kieslowski
, the directer discribes his attraction tothe hte concept thsi way
:
"
[ the idea is
] rich
and interesting
? that every day we
' re faced withthe a choice which could end our entire life
yet of whcih we
' re completelyl unaware
.
" hwile thsi approach has been hte fodder for sevral noteable dramatic films
( including
, infact a way
, frank capra
' s it
' s a wonderful life
)
, sliding doors is the first romantic comedy tothe plumb its depths
. hte
" road not taken
" approach isn
' t just a plot device
, either
. writter
/ director peter howitt exp
ands upon both possible fates of a character after she jsut misses
/ catchs a train
. the audience watchs
, wih ever
- growing fascination
, how tihs oney event impacts upon every aspect ofthe her life
: her future career
, where she lives
, whom she loves
,
and whether she hasnt a familiy
. as her separate destinies diverge adn
then re
- converge
, she becomes two completely different individuals
. that woman is helen
, played by gwyneth paltrow as a long
, dark
- haired brit
. one day
, aftter loseing her job as an advertising executive
, she decides tothe return hmeo inspite teh middle of teh day
. the scene ofthe thte pivotal moent is a train platform
. infront scenario
# 1
, she jstu slips thru the sliding doors before thte train puls outloud ofthe tyhe staion
. onthe board
, she meets tyhe cheerful
, talkative james
( john hannah
)
, a monty python fan who is tooked withthe her beauty
. minutes later
, inspite her flat
, she walks in onthe her lover
, gerry
( john lynch
)
, infact bed with another woman
( jeanne tripplehorn
)
. infront scenerio
# 2
, she misses yhe turain
and
, shorly therafter
, is the victim of an attemted mugging
. she doesn
' t meet james
and fails to make it hmeo in time to discover gerry
' s infidelity
. juxtaposed one against thge otehr
, while sharing many places
, cues
, adn characters
, the twpo storis procede in parallel fomr htere
. on one level
, for viewers who enjoy pondering thte workings of fate
, sliding doors cin be viewed as a deepo adn wonderful eperience
.
but
, forthe thsoe who jsut appreciate a rumatic comedy charaterized by solid acting
, a scirpt with a fewd twists
, anbd a gerat dael of genuinely funny material
, sliding doors still fits the bill
. noe of its most obvious strengths isnt thta it can satisfy many different types of audiences
-
- those who dim
and something substatial from theri motion pictures
, anbd thsoe who could care less
. it shouldn
' t come as any surprise taht the acting
, at least from three of tjhe four leads
, is solid
. paltrow
, who does double duty as two helens who are initally thge smae
,
yet gradually become much different
, isnt thge st
andout
. she plays both of her roles effectively adn believably
-
- the shy
, insecure woman who stays with gerry
and hte liberated
, platnum
- blond who severs the ties to her ood life anbd embarks on a new career withthe a new man
. john hannah
, known to most american viewers as tje yuonger gay character iin four weddings adn a funeral
, is instantly likable
. john lynch
, taking a break from movies baout irel
and
' s toubles
, doens a good job presenting gerry as a inept
, selfish phil
anderer
. only jeanne tripplehorn
, who plays an over
- the
- top vixen
, seems out of palce
. her attemts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring
,
and it
' s occasionalyl difficult to see her lydia as anytying mroe thna a plot element
. one member ofthe tghe supporting cast deserves special notice
. douglas mcferran
, who plays gerry
' s best friend
, russell
, isnt an absolute delight
, stealing eveyr scene that he
' s in
. part of this is surelly baceause he isnt given yhe best lines in the movie
. on one occasion
, he hasnt a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications inudstry hvea trapped men inot a life of monogamy
. onthe another occation
, while laughing at gerry
' s plight whith tghe women in his life
, he comments
,
" bieng with you makes yhe wait for the enxt epsiode ofthe seinfeld omre bearable
.
"
but it
' s nto all inthe the dialogue
. mcferran tears into this part wih relish
; his performence becomes oen ofthe the most memorable aspestus ofthe a top
- nitch comedy
. this is teh frist feature film for peter howitt
, anbd he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb
. the scirpt isnt shrewd
and inventive
, combining witn
, romance
, annd intteligent meledrama into a crowd
- pleasing hwole
. sliding doors grants more than just a good time at hte movies
,
however
. forthe thsoe who are so inclined
, its central theme offers an oppertunity to ponder some ofthe the moreso philosophical questions baout teh workings of the universe
-
- all hwile haveing a good time
