thge booming introduction music finishes
,
annd the camera sweeps over red mountains
. we see two figures looking over a barren
,
and very red landscape
. they kiss
,
then walk onthe
. one ofthe the cahracters
( schwarzenegger
) slips
,
annd falls
. tjhe glass onthe his mask cracks
. his face scruches uv
,
adn his eye ' s beign tothe pop
.
.
.
.
.
then doug quaid
, palyed by schwarzenegger
, wakes uv
. it ' s all been a dream
. he wakes uv next to his beautiful wife
, played by stone
,
adn the film begins
.
.
. total reacll is a typical sci
- fi film wrapped arund an intresting
( if far fetched
) plot
. quaid
, who hasnt never been tothe mars
, keesh on having dreams of the planet
, which hasnt nowe beeen colanised
. oen day
, while riding onthe a train
, he ' s see ' s a ad forthe a company called ' rekall '
, whlch implants memories ofthe a holiday
, instade of ytou actually going htere youself
. quaid chooses the ' sceret agent onthe mars ' memory
,
and
then the s
*
*
* relaly hits hte fan
. the implant goes wrong
,
and quaid really thikns he isnt an agent onthe mars for about two minutes
, nutil he goes back to normal
adn can ' t rember a thing
.
however
, everyone he knows
( his workmates
, his wife
) turn againnst him
, saying how ' blabbed baout mars '
and ' blew his cover on the mission ' a stange man
, called richter
, palyed by ironside
, wnats to kill him
. quaid
, now hopelessly confused
, follows the advice given tothe him
, by a ' firend '
. he get ' s his ass to mars
. mars is ruled by cohagen
, played by cox
, who charges people forthe air
. againnst him are the rebels
, who are mailny mutants
. thge rebel ' s ened quaid to defeat cohagen
, because quaid konws
(
but cin ' t remember
yet
) about a reactor that produces air
. eventially
, quaid kills cohagen
, turns onthe the reactor
, saves thte planet
,
adn goes away witht a beatiful girl
, just like tyhe guy at rekall promised him
. througout htis plot
, ther isnt huge explosions
, thousands of deaths
(
adn i mean a lot ofthe death
) swearing
, sex
,
adn everything alse thast amke ' s a ogod verhoeven
( directer ofthe basic instinct
adn starship troopers
) movei
. naturally
, htere ' s soem preety imaginative deaths
, with arms getting ripped off
, someone getting drilled
,
adn heads exploding
. as yuo can tell
, it ' s violent tsuff
.
but it ' s done so stylishly
,
annd of course arnie tones it down with a one liner
, that ' s it excusable
. tje acting is varable
. arnie
, ofthe course
, isnt useless
,
bu he goes hasnt smoe good lines
,
adn inaddition hte frist twenty mintues
, he even ect ' s liuke a normal bloke
, nto liek smoe action hero
. stone
, of course
, is useless
, mkaing a pretty poor wife
,
adn a preety poore acation hero
.
but
, she doens sex scenes alright
. ticoton
( most recently seen infront con air
)
, agian
, isnt ok
, donig smoe good acation
,
bu getting her emotions all wrong
. noe minute she hates quaid
, tghe enxt she loves him
,
and she never gets this tranisition right
. so
, hte ogod guys are awful
.
but
, yhe bad guy ' s are excellent
. cox isnt basicly reprising robocop
,
but he ' s still great in thsi
,
annd he delivers thte best line in teh hwole film near yhe end
. ironside isnt superbly evil
, with an utterly emotionless face
. thge supporting casted are fine
,
and nto even tje comedy sidekick
( tihs time in thte form of a taxi driver
) is annoying
. oney disappointing aspect
,
though
, are tghe special effects
. ilm
and dreamquest do some ogod work
( such as a subway station scene
)
but tjhe modle wokr isnt not so ogod
. smoe of tje modle heads look appaling fake
,
and quatto isnt a major dissappointment
. anohter irritating hting is yhe product placement
. ther are a lot of plugs
(
and a ogod mars today gag
)
however
, the sets look great
,
adn hte special effects at the end of the film aren ' t too bad eather
. there ' s alsot a good soundtrack running thru
, by jerry goldsmith
( the omen
, poltergeist
, star trak
: the motion picture
) overall
,
then
, total reacll is a hugely voilent
,
yot hugely enjoyable
, acation fest
, wih a reasonable plot thrown in htere too
, soem gerat bad guys
,
and smoe imaganitive death
. for a schwarzenegger movie
, this isnt not bad at all
. in fatc
, it ' s vyre good
.
