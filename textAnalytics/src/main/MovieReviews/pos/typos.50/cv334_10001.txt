the booming introduction music finishes
, anbd hte camera sweeps over red mountains
. we see twpo figures looking over a barren
, adn vyer red l
andscape
. tehy kiss
,
then walk onthe
. oney of the cahracters
( schwarzenegger
) slips
,
and falls
. the glass onthe his mask cracks
. his face scruches up
,
and his eye
' s begin to pop
.
.
.
.
.
then doug quaid
, palyed by schwarzenegger
, wakes uv
. it
' s all been a dream
. he wakes uv next tothe his beautiful wife
, played by stone
,
and the film beggins
.
.
. total reacll isnt a tipical sci
- fi film wrapped around an intresting
( if far fetched
) plot
. quaid
, who has never beeen to mars
, keeps onthe having dreams ofthe the planet
, whitch has now been colanised
. one day
, hwile riding on a turain
, he
' s see
' s a ad forthe a company called
' rekall
'
, which implants memories ofthe a holiday
, instade of you actually goign ther yourself
. quaid chooses the
' secert agent on mars
' memory
,
and
then tjhe s
*
*
* really hits hte fan
. the implant goes wrong
,
and quaid relaly thinks he isnt an agent onthe mars forthe about twpo mintues
, untl he goes back to normal anbd can
' t remember a thing
. howver
, everyone he knwos
( his workmates
, his wief
) turn aginst him
, saying how
' blabbed about mars
'
and
' blowed his cover on the mission
' a stange man
, called richter
, palyed by ironside
, wnats to kill him
. quaid
, now hopelessly confused
, follows the advice given tothe him
, by a
' friend
'
. he git
' s his ass to mars
. mars isnt ruled by cohagen
, palyed by cox
, who charges people for air
. agianst him are hte rebels
, who are mainly mutants
. the rebel
' s ened quaid to defeat cohagen
, because quaid knows
( bu can
' t remember yot
) about a reactor tyhat produces air
. evenhtually
, quaid kills cohagen
, turns on thge reactor
, saves the planet
,
and goes away with a beautiful girl
, just liuke hte guy at rekall promised him
. througout htis plot
, htere isnt huge explosions
, thous
ands of deaths
(
and i mean a lot ofthe death
) swearing
, sex
,
and everything else tath make
' s a ogod verhoeven
( directer of basic instinct anbd starship troopers
) movie
. naturally
, htere
' s soem pretty imaginative deaths
, with arms getting ripped off
, somone getting drilled
, anbd heads exploding
. as you can tell
, it
' s voilent tsuff
.
but it
' s done so stylishly
,
and of course arnie tones it down witht a oen liner
, that
' s it excusable
. the acting is variable
. arnie
, ofthe course
, isnt useless
,
but he goes has soem good lines
,
and iin the frist twenty minutes
, he even act
' s liuke a normal bloke
, nto liuke some acation hero
. stone
, of course
, is useless
, making a pretty poore wief
, anbd a preety poore acation hero
.
but
, she doens sex scenes alright
. ticoton
( most recently seen iin con air
)
, agina
, isnt ok
, doing some ogod acation
,
but getting her emotions all wrong
. one minute she hates quaid
, the next she loves him
, adn she never gets this tranisition right
. so
, tjhe good guys are awful
.
but
, the bad guy
' s are excellent
. cox isnt basicly reprising robocop
, bu he
' s still great inwhich htis
,
and he delivers teh best line infact the wohle film near thge end
. ironside isnt superbly evil
, with an utterly emotionless face
. hte supporting casted are fine
, anbd not even the comedy sidekick
( tihs tyme infront tje form of a taxi driver
) is annoying
. one disapointing aspect
,
though
, are tghe special effects
. ilm
and dreamquest dont smoe ogod work
( such as a subway staion scene
) bu tjhe modle work isnt not so good
. smoe ofthe tjhe model heads look appaling fake
, annd quatto is a major dissapointment
. another irritating thign isnt the product placement
. htere are a lot of plugs
(
and a ogod mars today gag
)
however
, tjhe sets look great
, adn the special effects at thge end of the film aren
' t too bad eather
. htere
' s alsot a ogod soundtrack running through
, by jerry goldsmith
( yhe omen
, poltergeist
, star trak
: hte motion picture
) overall
, thn
, total recall is a hugely voilent
, yot hugely enjoyable
, acation fest
, with a reasonable plot thrown inthe there too
, smoe great bad guys
, adn some imaganitive death
. for a schwarzenegger movei
, this is not bad at all
. infact fatc
, it
' s very ogod
.
