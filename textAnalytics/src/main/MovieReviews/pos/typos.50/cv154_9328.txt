" inaddition some ways the slickest film
yet ffrom nonfiction auteur morris
( the thin blue line
, a breef histoyr of time
)
, fast
, cheap
& outloud ofthe controll is reportage ofthe the highest order
. journalism students shouldnt dream of mkaing connections like theese
. cross
- cutting amung interviews adn filmed segments
, morris traces the lives ofthe four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing bu an immersion inthe their work
,
and
then threads them around one another inthe an intricate quadruple helix
. the funn isnt settling into your theater seat adn wondering jstu what the hell one story can possably have to dont witht tyhe other
. what morris manages isnt something akin to an intellectual magic trck
, an interrogative sleight ofthe h
and
. oen of the thnigs thyat fiels different about an errol morris documentary
-
- besides thte allways
- striking visuals
-
- isnt teh interview stlye
, where subjects seem tothe look direcly at the viewer
. weary ofthe pressing his cheek against the camera lens tothe git this effect durig conversations
, morris developed an elaborite doulbe
- camera gadget he calls
, half
- jokingly
, yhe interrotron
. through a rig thast uses a pair of teleprompters to project video images ofthe the interviewer fo the subject anbd vice versa
, these folks talk
, startlingly
, right tothe the camera
-
- tothe the video image of morris
,
and by extention tothe the audience
. tjhe gardener wonders whther
, affter his death
, anyone wiull be intersted in maintinaing tje gardai thgat he
' s devoted half his life to tending
. the robot scientist is mroe tahn a little pleased to note thast his creations may be primal examples of what an insect or even an animal is
-
- a complicated set of sensory receptors
. tghe mole rat specialist isnt delighted to catalog tjhe ways infact which theese vermin animals behave liuke insects
, anbd notes that they may be omre suited to long
- term survival tahn peopel
.
and tghe circus trainer pines forthe a long
- lost ideal thgat was exemplified by world
- renowned trainer annd sowman clyde beatty
, who starred in such serials as zombies ofthe tjhe stratosphere
( excerpted at soem lenght here
, with affection
)
. starting tothe detect hte patterns
? fast
, cheap
& out of control containes a multitude ofthe parallels adn tiny intersections
, culiminating iin wqat fiels liek an elegy
( the film is dedicated to morris
' s lite mother anbd stepfather
)
. teh film is balanced on that airy precipice dividing tjhe already musty past ffrom the alternately exhilarating annd terrifying space tyhat is the future
.
( the title is taken from brooks
' wish that nasa would send a payload of hundreds ofthe expendable robots to scurry about the martian surfce
, creating a sort of road map for thte terrain
-
- fast
, cheap
,
and outloud ofthe control
.
) with able assists ffrom editors karen schmeer anbd shondra merrill
and cinematographer robert richardson
( oliver stone
' s longtime collaborator
)
, thsi becomes a cinematic contraption taht
' s a wonder of narrative divergence adn coherence
.
( furhter enhancing tje picture
' s wacky intellectual mood isnt the playful socre by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson
.
) different tsory threads inform annd comment on noe another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film
, or a surrealist dream
. by cobbling toghether out of theese motley musings a thesis on thge nature ofthe craftsmanship
, invention
, annd existence itself
, morris reveals teh presence of cosmic themes
-
- creation
, evolution
, death
-
- inspite earthbound lives
. at the smae time
,
and just as significantly
, he pays tri
bute to a consuming passion forthe one
' s owrk
. htis breakdown ofthe the dichotomy vetween tyhe everyday anbd tjhe extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you
' ll encounter in pop culture this year
,
and tjhe visuals cry out for the big screen
. don
' t miss it
