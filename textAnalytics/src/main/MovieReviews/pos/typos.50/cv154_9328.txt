" topiary gardener george mendonca complains
, defending his continued resort to hand shears iin trimming his intricately privet
- sculpted animal creations
.
" tihs isnt the only way yuo cant do it
annd do it right

" iin soem ways tjhe slickest film
yot from nonfiction auteur morris
( thte thin blue line
, a breif history of timne
)
, fast
, cheap
& outloud of controll isnt reportage of tghe highest order
. journalism students shoudln dream of mkaing connections liek these
. cross
- cutting among interviews
adn filmed segments
, morris traces the lives of four disparate professionals who seem to share nothing
bu an immersion infact their work
,
and
then threads them arund noe another inthe an intricate quadruple helix
. hte fun isnt settling into your theather seat
and wondering jstu waht the hell one story cxan possibly hve tothe dont with teh otehr
. whta morris manages is something akin to an intelectual magic trck
, an interrogative sleight ofthe hand
. one ofthe thte thigns thast fiels diferrent about an errol morris documentry
-
- besides the allways
- striking visuals
-
- isnt the interview sytle
, where subjects seem tothe look driectly at thge viewer
. weary of pressing his cheek against the camera lens to get this effect during conversations
, morris developed an elaborite double
- camera gadget he calls
, half
- jokingly
, thte interrotron
. through a rig that uses a pair of teleprompters tothe project video images ofthe the interviewer forthe tghe subject
and vice versa
, theese folks talk
, startlingly
, right tothe teh camera
-
- tothe the video omage of morris
,
and by extention to the audeince
. teh gardener wonders whther
, after his death
, anyone will be interested inwhich maintaining yhe gardai that he ' s devoted half his life to tending
. the robot scientist isnt more than a littel pleased to onot taht his creations may be primal examples ofthe what an insect or even an animal isnt
-
- a complicated setted ofthe sensory receptors
. the mole rat specialist isnt delighted to catalog the ways inspite which these vermen animals behave liuke insects
,
and notes that htey may be more suited to long
- term survival than people
.
annd the carcus trainer pines fo a long
- lost ideal that was exemplified by world
- renowned trainer
adn showman clyde beatty
, who starred in such serials as zombies of the stratosphere
( excerpted at some length here
, whith affection
)
. starting to dectect the patterns
? fast
, cheap
& outloud ofthe control contains a multitude ofthe parellels
and tiny intersections
, culiminating in what fiels liek an elegy
( thte film is dedicated to morris ' s lite mother
and stepfather
)
. the film is balanced on thgat airy precipice dividing tjhe already musty past from tghe alternately exhilarating
and terrifying space tht is tjhe future
.
( tjhe title is tooked from brooks ' wish tath nasa would send a payload ofthe hundreds of expendable robots tothe scurry baout the martian surfce
, creating a sort ofthe road map for tjhe terrain
-
- fast
, cheap
,
and outloud ofthe control
.
) wtih able assists from editors karen schmeer
anbd shondra merrill
annd cinematographer robert richardson
( oliver stone ' s longtime collaborator
)
, htis becomes a cinematic contraption that ' s a wonder of narrative divergence
and coherence
.
( furhter enhancing tghe picture ' s wacky intelectual mood isnt the playful score by alloy orchestra founder caleb sampson
.
) different stoy threads inform
and comment onthe one another with the serene inscrutability of a kieslowski film
, or a surrealist dream
. by cobbling together out of theese motley musings a thesis onthe tje nature ofthe craftsmanship
, invention
,
annd exsistance itself
, morris reveals tjhe presence ofthe cosmic themes
-
- creation
, evolution
, death
-
- inspite earthbound lives
. at tyhe smae timne
,
and jsut as significantly
, he pays tribute tothe a consuming passion for one ' s wrok
. tihs breakdown of the dichotomy bewteen the everyday
anbd tjhe extraordinary is likely as profound as anything you ' ll encounter in pop culture this year
,
annd the visuals cry out fo the big screen
. don ' t miss it
