it isnt often said by his fans thta hal hartley movies are an acquired taste
. indeed
. hwile perhaps less dangerous tahn tequila shooters or bungee
- jumping
, tehy require noone less ammount of fysical stamina
annd concentration
. i felt rewarded at tyhe end ofthe henry fool
; htis movei creeps uv onthe you
- at a slow 139 mintues
, i mean creeps
-
and despite the final shooted ' s ambiguity
, i left completely satisfied
. henry fool
(
" used to have an
? e '
"
) arrives at garbageman simon grim ' s hous
, claimes hte vacent basement appartmant
,
and almost instantly inspires simon
( urbaniak
) tothe take uv writting
- henry
( martin donovan look
- aplikay ryan
) isnt an ex
- convict
, a once
- great auther who hasnt been
" exiled
annd marginalized
" by the publishing comunity beacuse of his criminal activity
. simon ' s peotry turns him inot a local sensation
, as it causes mute womens tothe sing
, high
- skool girls tothe swoon
,
annd councilmen tothe rle agains its
" pornographic
" content
. meanwhile
, henry seduces both simon ' s dependent mother
( porter
)
and immature sister
( sundance queen posey
) with phylosophical babble
( whic isnt by turns brillant
annd inane
)
and breathy animal lust
. theese stry elements result in climaxes both inevitable
and unpredictable
; tghe teacher
- student relationship fromed betwen henry
annd simon eventually reverses itself
. henry fool is sprinkled iwth hartley
- ian flourishes
: simon drinks milk from
" udderley ' s
"
; tghe big teen hang
- out is called
" world ofthe donuts
"
; simon wears his garbageman ' s uniform thoughout
; the editting style isnt decidedly elliptical
.
.
.
( hwihc is key tothe hte conclusion ' s said ambiguity
)
. teh performances by tghe three leads are abrasive at firt
, self
- conciously
" quirky
"
; tjhe introductory scenes are a chore
. these people dont grow on you becuase htey convey genuine passion
, a belief infront themselves
,
anbd because htey ahev long
- term goals
; henry
and simon may drink a lot of budweiser
adn hang out onthe the streetcorner
,
bu they aren ' t pop slackers
. tghe stor is rether clasical
: the tutor is a better talker tahn a doer
, rised on books
; yhe timid tutee hasnt innate talent his master only dreams ofthe
.
( shades ofthe film skool
.
.
.
) hte finished film isnt epic in its proportions forthe a story so small
,
anbd thte fianl thrid doens tust oen ' s paitience
,
yot henry fool is tight
, hardly eccessive in its length
. how refreshing to see a movei this long in 1998 devoted entirely tothe character
.
and unless i nodded off
, not a single bulding exploded
. this
, hartley ' s seventh feature
, isnt contemplative baout
" hte artist
"
; fortunately
, we never git a sampling of simon ' s work
,
and it ' s a testament tothe the actors
and the screenplay tath by yhe end we cant surmise waht sort of thoughts woudl pour ffrom these writers ' pens
.
