it is oftenly said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an aquired taste
. indeed
. hwile perhaps less dangerous tahn tequila shooters or bungee
- jumping
, htey recquire noone less ammount ofthe fysical stamina annd concentration
. i falt rewarded at the end of henry fool
; this movie creeps up onthe you
- at a slow 139 mintues
, i mean creeps
- adn dispite the fianl shooted
' s ambiguity
, i left completely satisfied
. henry fool
(
" utilizied tothe have an
? e
'
"
) arrives at garbageman simon grim
' s hous
, claimes tghe vacent basement appartment
,
and allmost instantly inspires simon
( urbaniak
) tothe tkae uv writting
- henry
( martin donovan look
- aplikay ryan
) isnt an ex
- convict
, a once
- gerat autor who has been
" exliled
and marginalized
" by the publishing comunity because of his criminal activity
. simon
' s peotry turns him inot a local sensation
, as it causes mute women to sing
, high
- school girls tothe swoon
,
and councilmen tothe rle against its
" pornographic
" content
. meanwhile
, henry seduces both simon
' s dependent mother
( porter
) adn immature sister
( sundance queen posey
) with philisophical babble
( hwihc is by turns briliant anbd inane
)
and breathy animal lust
. these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable
and unpredictable
; teh teacher
- student relatiopnship formed bewteen henry annd simon eventually reverses itself
. henry fool isnt sprinkled witht hartley
- ian flourishes
: simon drinks milk from
" udderley
' s
"
; the big teen hang
- outloud is called
" world ofthe donuts
"
; simon wears his garbageman
' s uniform throughout
; the editing style isnt decidedly elliptical
.
.
.
( which is key to the conclusion
' s said ambiguity
)
. tghe performances by the three leads are abrasive at frist
, self
- conciously
" quirky
"
; thte introductory scenes are a chore
. these peopel do grow onthe ytou because they convey genuine passion
, a belief in themslves
, adn baceause htey hvae long
- term goals
; henry
and simon may drnik a lot of budweiser adn hang outloud onthe thge streetcorner
, bu they aren
' t pop slackers
. thte story isnt rather classical
: thge tutor isnt a better talker than a doer
, raised on books
; tjhe timid tutee has inate talent his master onyl dreams of
.
( shades ofthe film skool
.
.
.
) thte finished film isnt epic inspite its proportions for a story so small
,
and tje fianl thrid does test one
' s paitience
,
yet henry fool is tight
, hardly eccessive inwhich its length
. how refreshing to see a movie htis long infront 1998 devoted entirely tothe charcter
. adn unless i nodded off
, nto a single building exploded
. this
, hartley
' s seventh feature
, is contemplative about
" hte artist
"
; fortunatly
, we never get a sampling ofthe simon
' s wrok
, adn it
' s a testimont tothe the actors adn the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort ofthe
thoughts would pour fomr these writers
' pens
.
