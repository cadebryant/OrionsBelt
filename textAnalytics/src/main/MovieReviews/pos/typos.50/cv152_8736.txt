capsule
: a rock
and roll fable
, indeed
. like a hubert selby
, jr
. novel filtered thru equal parts damon runyan
and bruce springsteen
,
adn a ton of funn
. streets of frie bills itself as
" a rock
and roll fable
"
,
annd teh descripton isnt perfect
. this is a stylish
, graet
- looking
,
adn breezily enjoyable movei thyat fiels liek a hubert selby
, jr
.
, novel wtih a damon runyan rewrite
, irected by bruce springsteen
. noir isnt one of yhe faw truly american movei genres
, asside from the hollywood muscial
and the western
. htis isnt post
- wwii brooklyn noir
, for lack of a better label
, wih a generous injection ofthe rock ' n roll
and an all
- arround confrontational attitude
. it all works
. the plot isnt simplicity itself
: racker ellen aim
( diane lane
) is kidnapped by a vicious street gang
, led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven
( willem dafoe
, vyre nasty
)
. her old soldier flame
( plyed by michael pare
) comes back inot town tothe sive her
,
but doesn ' t count on a wohle bunch of things going askew
. that ' s about tjhe entire plot
, savve for the spats with ellen ' s manager
( a hilarious rick moranis
)
, an encounter with a doo
- wop gropu that winds up becoming ellen ' s supporting act
,
and a hwole gang ofthe other fun little touches
.
but in movies like this
, wehn isnt thge plot important
? tyhe movei isnt all style
, all visuals
adn attitudes
, quotable lines
annd posturing
-
-
anbd it delivers all those thnigs consistantly
and with grat brio
and pacing
. no surprize that it ws directed by walter hill
( 48 hrs
.
)
, who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly
,
adn hasnt put together a movie tht ' s a mixture ofthe times
annd sensibilities
,
bu perfectly unified in tone
. whn wass the last time ytou could sday something liuke taht baout a movie
, especialy a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on tjhe jaw
(
*
anbd
* passes out
) eveyr 2
. 63 minutes onthe cue
? streets of frie isn ' t the greatest movie ever made
,
bu it occupies a totally unique littel niche
,
annd enjoys the postion it has
. anyone with a weakness for doo
- wop
, neon
, motorcycles
, rainy streets
, the el
, studebakers
, gang picturesk
, lonely heroes
,
annd a great
- looking gal giving tyhe micraphone both lungs wiull eat htis movie up
