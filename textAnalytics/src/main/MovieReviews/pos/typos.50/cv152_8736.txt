,
and breezily enjoyable movei that fiels like a hubert selby

, novel with a damon runyan rewriet
, irected by bruce springsteen
. noir is oen of thge few truly american movei genres
, aside from teh hollywood muscial
and tje western
. thsi isnt post
- wwii brooklyn noir
, fo lack ofthe a better label
, withthe a generous injection ofthe rock
' n roll adn an all
- around confrontational atitude
. it all works
. tje plot is simplicity itself
: rocker ellen aim

and it delivers all those things consistantly
and with great brio anbd pacing
. no suprize tht it was directed by walter hill
( 48 hrs
.
)
, who underst
ands tihs kind ofthe macho romanticism perfectly
, annd has put toghether a movei tyhat
