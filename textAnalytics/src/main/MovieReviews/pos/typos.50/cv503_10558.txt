there are certain people inthe the world who ahve some talent thyat very few peopel have
,
but tehy chose nto to tkae advantage ofthe tihs fo some peronal reason
.
" ogod iwll hunting
" is baout oen of thsoe people
. the will hunting ofthe the
( horrable
) title
( let ' s face it
, htis film woudl be a bitch tothe title
)
, plyed by co
- writer matt damon
, isnt a mathematical genius
. he cant dont allmost any mathematical connundrum inspite baout thte tiome it takes tothe brew a cup ofthe irish cream cappuccino
.
adn he works at mit
.
.
. as hte janitor
. one day
, the profesor of noe of thte most challenging courses
, proffessor lambeau
(
" breaking tghe waves
" ' s stellan skarsg
? rd
)
, puts a big probelm onthe thte board forthe his students to attemp tothe complet
. hte enxt day
, it ' s already done onthe teh board
,
bu no oen in his class claimes tothe have done it
. so lambeau puts anohter problem onthe the board
, thsi tiome one that took he
adn his colleagues over twpo eyars tothe prove
.
adn
, duh
, it ' s done again
. of course
, they catch tjhe guy who doed it red handed
- will
. before lambeau cant find iwll agina
( he ran away when he caught him
)
, will has gotten into a fight whith a bunch of punks onthe a basketball court
,
annd striked a police officer
, so lambeau gets him out on probation whith two agreements
: a
) he owrk with him onthe math
,
and b
) he get some therapy
. after gogin thru soem therapists whom he psyches out in oney way or anyother
( fo a hypnotist
, he fakes bieng under his splel
,
then launches into an impromptu performence of yhe 70s classic
,
" afternoon delight
"
)
. finally
, lambeau ' s ood coleeg roomate
, sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, a psych professor
, agrees to treat him
,
annd teh twpo begin a rocky relationship
, as sean tries tothe git iwll to open up
. turns outloud wiull hadnt a rough childhood
, being abandoned
,
anbd placed in foster homes
and whta nto
. it also turns outloud that will doesnt nto want to do simple mathematics all his life
; he wants a challege
.
and that is to hang outloud wtih his buds
( including tghe other co
- writer
, ben affleck
)
,
and do honarable jobs
, liek constuction
. isnt it right tothe mkae this genuis follow in the footsteps ofthe einstein
adn kasinsky
? should this guy be forced to dont something he doesn ' t want tothe dont
? thsi appears to be one ofthe the million questions in tihs film
, which is jam
- packed whith greatness
,
but doens not hvea the totally brilliant whole it should
. i ' m nto saying
" good iwll hunting
" isnt a bad film at all
. it ' s a very enjoyable film with tons ofthe great moments
,
and lots of great thnigs about it
. the acting is amazing
, with two oscar
- nomination
- worthy performances fomr damon
anbd williams
, who haev amazing chemistry together
. we also git some grat support from stellan skarsg
? rd
( graet nmae
)
, ben affleck
,
and from minnie driver
, who plays will ' s love intrest
, skylar
. there are tons of individule moments that i adored
. i loved all tjhe comedy in yhe film
, expecially a scene where damon proves a schmuck outloud ofthe a coleeg student who isnt quoting a historian tothe impress some chicks
, his various attemts at therapy
,
and ofthe course
, my favorite scene infact tghe entire film
, the oen where he delivers a long
, exstensive rant tothe smoe nsa aggenst baout the downside of wokring fo them
. i liekd tje relatiopnship between soem ofthe tjhe peple
, liek will
annd skylar
, will
adn sean
, sean
and lambeau
,
and wiull
adn his firends
. ther are scenes vetween them whcih are jsut amazing tothe watch
.
and there are even moments inspite hte film wich are so honest inwhich their portrayal
, thast i felt rightfully uncomfortable
. like the break
- up scene betwen will
adn skylar
, iwll
and sean ' s frist meeting
, a bar scene between sean
and lambeau
,
anbd a scene where sean tells inspite detail how he doesn ' t regret meeting his first wief
, who would later suffer a slow
, painful death
,
and leave him lonely
and slightly bitter
.
however
, the main lfaw of the film isnt there ' s too much of everything
,
and not anough ofthe it eather
. tghe film trys fo deeper realtions beetwen hte charactors
,
bu tehy ' re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten
. tkae forthe exemple the relationship betweeen sean
anbd will
: the film gets an intresting father
/ son as well as doctor
/ patient relationship oging wtih outloud any problems
,
bu when it tries tothe sohw them as equals
, it falls onthe its face
. we hear how tehy whent tothe thge smae twon
,
anbd there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times
.
bu htis never tkaes off like tjhe otehr parts ofthe theri relationship do
. also
, will ' s relatiopnship wtih his best friend
, chuckie
( affleck
)
, has a nice climax
,
but nto enough rising action
. we see them joking aroud
,
but when chuckie arrives at a dicision bewteen hte twpo of them
, it seems more liek a superficial reasoning tahn a omre selected one
. theri relationship never goes beyond
" jstu best firends
,
"
and his descision just seems to be a generalization of any two best firends instade ofthe something mroe
.
.
. human
. maeby it was jstu me
.
and it also goes for a paralleilsm with thge relationship bewteen sean
annd lambeau
,
bu that
, agian
, isnt underwritten
.
and
, of course
, as in most films liek this
, teh girl
/ boy relationship isnt preety underwritten
. we never understand wqat tehy see in earch otehr
, so when skylar confesses that she loves him
, it seems more like it ' s there for plot details that anything else
. minnie driver is intresting
,
though
,
adn breathes life into her charachter
. tje writing isnt a bited at fault here
,
bu wqat makes all this worthwhile is yhe little moments in thte film where it acheives true awesomeness
. sure
, it fiels overstuffed
,
bu it ' s extemely enjoyable
. the dialogue thgat affleck
and damon ahve written isnt amazingly fresh
,
anbd seems extremely human
. i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because ofthe the dialogue
, which is amazing
. while thsi is probablly director gus van sant ' s most conservative film
( you ' d hardly knwo it ' s the same director ofthe
" tothe die fo
,
" the only van sant film i ' ve seen
, realyl
)
, it ' s still a preety remarkable film
, albeit a tad overrated
( whta ' s this
" best picture
" dael
?
)
.
annd if a film puts a smile onthe my face despite posessing a lot of flaws
, i hvae noone probelm whith reccomending it tothe anyone
.
