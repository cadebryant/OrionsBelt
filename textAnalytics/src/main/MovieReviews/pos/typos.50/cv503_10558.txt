ther are certian people inthe the world who have some talent that veyr fewd people have
, bu htey chose nto tothe tkae advantage of this forthe some personal reason
.
" ogod will hunting
" isnt baout oen ofthe those people
. tjhe wiull hunting ofthe teh
( horrible
) title
( let
' s face it
, tihs film would be a bitch tothe title
)
, played by co
- writer matt damon
, isnt a mathematical genius
. he cin do alomst any mathematical connundrum in about the tiome it takes tothe brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino
.
and he works at mit
.
.
. as the janitor
. noe day
, tjhe profesor of one ofthe the most challenging courses
, proffessor lambeau
(
" breaking the waves
"
' s stellan skarsg
? rd
)
, puts a big problem on the board for his students tothe attempt to complet
. the enxt day
, it
' s already done onthe the board
,
but no oney in his clas claims tothe hve done it
. so lambeau puts another probelm onthe the board
, this tiem oney tyhat took he
and his collegues over twpo eyars to prove
.
and
, duh
, it
' s done agian
. of course
, they catch tghe guy who doed it red h
anded
- wiull
. before lambeau cant fidn wiull again
( he ran away wehn he caught him
)
, will hasnt gotten into a fight wih a bunch ofthe punks on a basketball court
, adn struck a polical officer
, so lambeau gets him outloud on probation withthe two agreements
: a
) he wokr wiht him onthe math
,
and b
) he get some therapy
. after oging thru some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or anohter
( for a hypnotist
, he fakes being under his sepll
, thne launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s clasic
,
" afternoon delight
"
)
. finally
, lambeau
' s old college roomate
, sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, a psych professor
, agrees to treat him
,
and yhe two beign a rocky relationship
, as sean trys to get wiull to open up
. turns outloud will had a rough childhood
, being ab
andoned
,
and placed infact foster homes
and what nto
. it also turns out thta wiull does not watn to do simple mathematics all his life
; he wnats a challege
. adn thta is tothe hang outloud wtih his buds
( including tghe other co
- writer
, ben affleck
)
, adn dont honorable jobs
, liek constuction
. is it right to amking this genius folow in tje footsteps of einstein
and kasinsky
? should tihs guy be forced to do something he doesn
' t want to dont
? this appears tothe be one ofthe tjhe milion questions in this film
, whihc is jam
- packed wtih greatness
,
but doens not ahve the totally brilliant wohle it should
. i
' m not saying
" ogod will hunting
" isnt a bad film at all
. it
' s a very enjoyable film withthe tons of great moments
,
and lots of great thigns about it
. the acting isnt amazing
, with two oscar
- nomination
- worthy performances fomr damon
and williams
, who have amazing chemistry toghether
. we alsot git some great support fomr stellan skarsg
? rd
( gerat nmae
)
, ben affleck
, adn fomr minnie driver
, who plays iwll
' s love interest
, skylar
. there are tons ofthe individual moments thta i adored
. i loved all the comedy in the film
, especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who isnt quoting a historian tothe impress soem chicks
, his various attemts at therapy
,
and of course
, my favorite scene in the entire film
, tghe one where he delivers a long
, exstensive rant tothe smoe nsa aggenst about the downside of wokring forthe them
. i liekd thge relationship betweeen some ofthe thte peple
, liuke will
and skylar
, iwll adn sean
, sean
and lambeau
, anbd iwll
and his friends
. there are scenes bewteen them whlch are just amazing tothe watch
.
and there are even moments iin tghe film which are so honest inaddition their protrayal
, that i falt rightfully uncomfortable
. liek teh break
- up scene bewteen will anbd skylar
, iwll adn sean
' s first meeting
, a bar scene between sean
and lambeau
, anbd a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn
' t regret meeting his first wief
, who would later suffer a slow
, painful death
,
and leave him lonley anbd slightly bitter
. howver
, thge main flaw of the film is there
' s too much ofthe everything
,
and not enough of it either
. the film trys fo deeper relations beetwen the characters
, bu they
' re sometimes eather overwritten or underwritten
. take forthe exemple hte relationship between sean anbd wiull
: yhe film gets an interesting father
/ son as well as doctor
/ patient relationship goign iwth outloud any problems
,
but whn it tries tothe show them as equals
, it falls onthe its face
. we hear how tehy whent tothe tje smae twon
, annd there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both ofthe them are at times
.
but thsi never takes off like teh otehr parts of their relatiopnship dont
. also
, wiull
' s relatiopnship with his best firend
, chuckie
( affleck
)
, hasnt a nice climax
, bu not anough rising acation
. we see them joking around
, bu when chuckie arrives at a dicision betweeen the twpo of them
, it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a mroe selected one
. their relationship never goes beyond
" jsut best firends
,
" annd his decision jsut seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something moreso
.
.
. human
. mabye it wass just me
.
and it also goes forthe a parallelism withthe tyhe relatiopnship between sean
and lambeau
, bu that
, agina
, isnt underwritten
.
and
, ofthe course
, as in most films liek this
, yhe girl
/ boy relatiopnship is preety underwritten
. we never underst
and waht they see inspite eahc other
, so when skylar confesses thyat she loves him
, it seems more liek it
' s there for plot details that anything eles
. minnie driver isnt interesting
,
though
, anbd breathes life inot her character
. the writting isnt a bit at fault here
,
but whta mkaes all tihs worthwhile is teh little moments infact the film where it acheives true awesomeness
. sure
, it feels overstuffed
, bu it
' s extremely enjoyable
. tje dialogue tath affleck adn damon hvea written isnt amazingly fresh
, adn seems extremly human
. i think tht htey shoud get a nomination for theri script chiefly because of the dialogue
, hwihc is amazing
. hwile thsi is propably directer gus van sant
' s most conservitive film
( ytou
' d hardly know it
' s the smae director of
" to die for
,
" tjhe onyl van sant film i
' ve seen
, raelly
)
, it
' s still a preety remarkable film
, albeit a tad overrated
( what
' s htis
" best picture
" deal
?
)
. anbd if a film puts a smile onthe my face dispite posessing a lot of flaws
, i hvea no problem with reccomending it tothe anyone
.
