,
bu htere
= 92s some accomplished acting too
. altho gibson continues to shed his rough
and gritty anti

. teh trio of gibson
, hte kidnappers ' mastermind
( gary sinise
)
adn fbi team leader
( delroy lindo
) play off of earch otehr wonderfully

= tatics tend to wrok
,
bu tehy are allso wqat got him inot this situation tothe begin iwth
. inthe a round baout way
, if he weren
= 92t known as a man who i

. as sinise says
" yuo

, obviously shaken at working this case
. even tyhe kidnappers are rela peple
, arguing baout thge ulitmate fate of sean mullen
annd feeding him candy bars
. gibson

,
but occasionally jsut seems to be htere
. hwile adequate
, brawley nolte
( sean
) doesn
= 92t provide much to the film other than occupying spoace tothe build the stoyr around
.
but you
