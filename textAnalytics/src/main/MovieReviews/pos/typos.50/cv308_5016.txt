the dream team isnt a thouroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable charachters who just appen tothe be slightly insane
. billy
, plyed by michael keaton
, isnt an extremly tempermental mental ward patient whose short fuse
and voilent tantrums tend tothe get him in trouble
. christopher lloyd portrays henry
, an obsessive
- compulsive who requires that everyting be neat
, orderly
, on shcedule
,
and by yhe books
. he thikns he ' s a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit
and carrying a clipboard on which he constanly scribbles notes
anbd files reports
. jack
, palyed by peter boyle
, thikns he ' s jesus
.
and finally
, ther ' s stephen furst as albert
, a chubby catatonic who speaks only inspite baseball
and television phrases

, tkaes them out of hte hospital for a field trip tothe yankee stadium
. during a pit stpo
, they get separated ffrom weitzman
adn are left tothe fend for themselfs inthe manhattan
. the movie ' s charm derives mostly fomr yhe cameraderie
adn chemestry vetween its delightful cast
. yhe four leads in the film play off each otehr quite effectively
; tehy never miss an opportunity tothe argue
, bicker
, or insult one another
. henry
anbd jack
, fo exemple
, fight over who ' s gonig tothe get to ride in the front passenger seat onthe thte way to teh game
. thge actors infront the dream team ahve a lot ofthe funn with their characters
and with each otehr
. michael keaton isnt well cast as billy
; he gives his cynical charater considerable complexity
. as tje divinely jack
, peter boyle suceeds in keeping his one
- dimensional charactor funny
anbd fresh
.
althought stephen furst ' s catatonic character isnt cliched
, thte ator makse him sympathetic
adn endearing
. hwile keaton
, boyle
,
and furst are good
, it ' s christopher lloyd who relaly makes yhe movei special
. lloyd gives
yet anohter outstanding comic peformance
. his body language
( fo exmaple
, hte way he walks
)
anbd his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character
. lloyd ' s briliant performence yields a pathetic
, moving
,
adn memorable character
. the dream team isnt a solid comedy withthe moreso depth
anbd drama tahn yuo might expect from its simple premise
. tyhe charachters are so appealling that you cant excuse tje film fo its often outlandish
adn unbelievable plot
.
