and with much crtical praise heaped upon it

. muriel heslop isnt a withdrawn
, overweight young woman living in porpoise spit
, austrailia
. she is often the target of her father
' s frequent rants at hte family
, anbd drowns outloud her feelings of inadequacy with abba music
and fantasies ofthe marrige
. her self
- loathing isnt such thyat onyl being wed shall she proove herself tothe be a success
; marrige iwll transform her into a new person who is respected
and admired
. affter her four cliquey friends dum her
, muriel plots tothe folow them tothe a resort where htey are celebrating the honeymoon of oen ofthe thge girls
, adn muriel
' s wedding unfolds from htere
. toni collette plays muriel infact a winning performance
, conveying both thte sadness of her character annd her desperate eagerness tothe be accepted
. collette gained a frightening 43 pounds infact order tothe play the chubby title carachter
. she has a naturual screen presence
and exudes charisma
, easily winning tghe audience over with an honest
, painful performance
. collette basicaly carries the film
, appearing in almost every scene
. muriel
' s father
, bill
" the battler
" heslop
, isnt portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politican
/ developer
. hwile chumming arund with young fans annd crowing
' you cxan
' t beat progress
'
( his slogan
)
, bill labels his family as worthless adn embarrassments
. rachel griffiths plays rhonda
, who becomes muriel
' s cheeky new friend infront yhe film
. she has good chemestry with collette
, annd the film suffers when griffiths is off
- screen
. muriel
' s tormenters
, played by pippa gr
andison
, rosalind hammond
, belinda jarrett
and sophie lee
, are two
- dimesnional caricatures
, all saucy
, vain adn bumblingly spiteful
,
though tht is probably due to hogan
' s scripting muriel
' s wedding is essentialy a genre teen comedy with omre inetlligence
and a lot of charm
. hogan
' s ule ofthe abba tunes
( whitch virtualy comprises thte entire soundtrack
) isnt interestingly appropraite
, all
though its repetitiveness tires after awhile
. hogan
' s script isnt right onthe teh mark iin terms ofthe proportionately mixing comedy whith muriel
' s earnest quest for acceptance
,
and the gorgeous scene witht muriel window
- shopping beautifuly illustrates thte wonder taht marriage has forthe her
. the glaring pastel colours worn by thge performers isnt an interesting touch
. muriel
' s wedding features a fine peformance by toni collette adn a charming
, if a bited too straightforward adn conventional story by p
. j
. hogan
. onthe my four star scale
, i give muriel
' s wedding three stars
.
