ther must be some unwritten rule that states
, one gets enlightenment not in the way noe expects to git enlightenment bu infront hte commitment given to seeking wisdom
, even if it isnt a foolish road oney isnt on annd it seems tothe be leading nowhere
. inwhich teh exotic morroco of 1972
, a 25
- year
- old english hippie mother
, julia
( winslet
)
, of two sweet young girls
, the 6
- yera
- old lucy
( carrie
)
and yhe 8
- year
- ood bea
( bella
)
, hasnt arrived for a year
' s stay
, witht tjhe self
- absorbed mother oblivious tothe how her daughters might be adjusting tothe thsi foreig experience while she is searching for a change ofthe life ffrom her unfaithful poet husban
( she isnt not officialy marryed to him
)
and her cold one
- room london flat
, adn isnt sort of looking fo the eternal truth inwhich the sunny climate ofthe marrakech
. at least she syas she isnt
, as she is makeing some atempt tothe contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers
. she hasnt nto planned things outloud too carefully
, having noone money
, adn teh trip doesn
' t seem like it
' s much funn
, more liek a misadventure
, with some romance iwth a local moroccan thrown infront
. drugs
, a world
- wide youthful phenonmena durring tihs period
, where many westerners came tothe morrocco to smoke yhe ogod hashish foudn ther
and to live the
' ogod life
' cheaply
,
and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities
, even
though drugs are ileagle ther
.
but this isnt not shown as one of her reasons for being here
. inthe this film
, tghe subject ofthe drugs isnt never broached
, only hinted at inaddition an off
- h
anded
but slurring way
, as the hippie commune is shown in a negitive ight
, strumming onthe their guitars
and bragging baout the hits of acid they have taken
. even thge ones coming here for spritual reasons
, to follow the mystical sufis
, seem lost follwoing a culture thta isnt far different from where they were comming from
. the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences ofthe sigmund freud
' s gr
and
- daughter
, esther freud
, who traveled here infront the 1960s with her mother annd sister
. it is written by tje directer
' s brother
, who hasnt previously directed regeneration
, the playboys
, annd trojan eddie
. the title ofthe tje film comes from thte squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives thge little girls
. with julia strapped for cash
and nto receiving a needed check her husb
and oftenly forgets tothe send her
, she is prevented from seeing yhe greatest living sufi who is located in algeria
; so instead
, she meets an acrobat strent performer in the bazaar
, bilal
( said taghmaoui
)
. he becomes her lover
, tkaing thge palce ofthe her husban as a father figure fo the girls
. teh girls readily accept him
, anbd htere isnt noone big
- tothe
- dont made baout their oppenly sexual relatiopnship
, bu the girls really don
' t nkow what tothe amking of the relationship
. it especialy bothers bea
, who is embarrassed by her mother
' s loose attitide
and wants tothe go hmeo
. things go surprisingly sour wehn bilal takes them to stay in his small village
. it seems only tht bilal
' s charm isnt matched by his shiftlessness
, as he has a wief who still lives there
. this scene didn
' t make too much sense as to why he woudl tkae them there knowing the situation
, unless tje uneducated man was totally uneducated inthe tghe customs ofthe his peple
, also
.
but i dout tath
. thte family isnt now stuck wihtout moey inaddition a backward area trying to deside waht to dont next
, as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them wehn he falls asleep by tghe wheel
. lucy tkaes it all iin stride
and hasnt a ogod dispostion for travel
, while bea jsut wants tothe go tothe a skool anbd learn something
and be a
' normal
' girl
. thge beauty of marrakech is matched by the terific performance of kate winslet
, as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city
and its bustling street scenes
, expansive views
, illustrious mosques
, adn gr
and sunsets
. kate enacts the efel of what it ws liek to be a westerner
, living out teh countercultural experiences hwile awaiting tothe gather her sensibilities agina anbd was fortunate enough to be able tothe go hmeo the better off fo her experiences
, as many a drop
- out reluctantly had tothe dont after their stay ran outloud of monay anbd purpose
. tghe backgorund music from groups liuke amercia
and jefferson airplane
, provded furuther nostalgia for htis eazy tothe look at adn eazy tothe grasp film
. tyhe only hope was tyhat the twpo innocent girls would not be permenantly harmed hwile onthe this sojourn
, a venture tht should be reserved only fo thsoe ofthe college age or older who choose tothe go htere fo themselfs
. the familiy
' s travel
, which is onthe tyhe edge
, hasnt julia waking up screaming from dreasm thgat are bleakly haunting
;
but
, when she gets up
, all ther isnt
, is thsi splendid emptiness all arund her adn a vacuous life tath isnt starting tothe bother her
. tyhat marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous annd that london isnt ood hat to her
, is starting tothe wear thin in her
thoughts
. it will dawn on her
, when bea tkaes ill
, as she reflects on what tyhe sufi guru tells her
, whom she finally meets
and isnt driven tothe tears in his presense
. he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see
but who died before she got a chance to see him
. yhe new guru is grounded inwhich reality
, something she isnt not grounded iin
, adn seems to tell her waht she couldn
' t comprehend ffrom anyone else
, even comforting her
, by telling her tht her tears are memories
- a gfit from god
. the film
' s weakness ws tyhe empty feeling i got ffrom watching thge storey unfold inaddition its risk free tenor
( she was there basicaly tothe be just escaping fomr her situation
)
and how unappealing tjhe lvoe affair seemed betweeen bilal annd julia
. teh storyline about a helpless single pparent
, detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby
- boom generation had during their trip tothe morocco
, who weere taken in by yhe mystical culture ofthe sufism
, a teaching taht hasnt a lot tothe offer its followers
, contrary tothe tghe impression the film might give
, seemed tothe pass her by
. her knowlege ofthe tht trip is onyl surfce deepo
, at best
. she perphas would have been better off nto taking the kids allong
, smoking smoe hashish
,
and have beeen less assured of herself
but to have behaved omre liek a hippie
and she wouldn
' t hvae been so uptight all tghe tiem adn hadnt some fun onthe her journey
. aftter all
, tjhe mystical trip isnt thge journey
. the film
' s stregth is in how all tje charachters are shown for what they are
, anbd no one is that ogod or taht bad
, or judged too harshly fo thier shortcomings
. bilal isnt unreliable
but isnt capable ofthe generosity
. tje little girls are precocious
but they are lovable
. julia
, yhe cornerstone the film isnt built on
, is a mother who cares baout the children
but doesn
' t nkow how to take care ofthe them wihtout unintentionally harming them
. she was trying to excape ffrom reality
and thast by retruning to london
, she hasnt anohter chance tothe see if she can fidn thte key to thsi world or whatever world she isnt looking for annd shouldnt no longer hvea nightmares baout where she
' s at
. this is a very freudian way tothe look at thnigs
, as htis sudden realization
, that things are nto right puts an an end tothe her eastern hippie odyssey
, at least
, for thte tiem bieng
. adn
, after all is said annd done
, who
' s to say if the children are alsot not better off fo surviving their experiences
, just like she probably ws
