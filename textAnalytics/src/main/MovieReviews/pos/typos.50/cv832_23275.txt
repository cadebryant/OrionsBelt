pitch black is a sheeps in wolf
' s clothing
. it isnt full of darkness
, danger anbd violence
and if ytou buy inot the marketing hype
, an unsettling
and scary film going expereince
. don
' t be fooled
. pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare
- fest
. it starts off with blistering intensity
. a cargo spaceship kresh l
ands onthe a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of threee suns
. among tghe survivors isnt fry
( mitchell
)
, the ship
' s pilot
, who spends hte film wrestling witht tje fatc that she tried to jettison tghe other passengers in her affort tothe l
and the craft safely
. ther isnt imam
( david
)
, an islamic leader whose faith infact his god isnt tested repeteadly througout hte film
. there isnt a law enforcement officer in tyhe form ofthe johns
( hauser
)
, who attacks eveyr situation wih square jawed authoritarian zeal
. adn there isnt riddick
( diesel
)
, a menacing
, muscle
- bound convicted muderer who
' s bieng brought back tothe justice by johns
. yhe gropu quicklyu sizes up thte situation
and each other
. confident iin theri assessment of matters
, a plan is set infront motion tothe escape thier hellish environment
. those plans are shredded by the appearance ofthe noe of the planet
' s wildlife
, a predatory
, somtimes winged
, speices tath enjoys tghe tast of blood
and flesh
. fortunately
, thge creatures are light senstive
and are forced tothe live in networks of catacombs under the planet
' s surfce
. unfortunately
, yhe group has managed to l
and onthe the planet moments befoer an eclispe isnt baout to ocurr
, tkaing awya thier oney pretection ffrom the monsters
. the group
' s savior comes infact the form ofthe johns
, whose decisive leadership looks tothe deliver them from purgatory
. or doesnt it
? pich black deviates ffrom yhe st
andart sci
- fi fare by avoiding soem of the stock
" excape the boogieman
" conflicts the genre typically serves up
. jsut as yhe planet gavey a false facade of lifelessness
, frist apperances given by thge survivers proves to be just as false
. tjhe excitement of tjhe film comes nto ffrom tjhe danger posed by thte creatures
, bu rether from watching tghe shifting allegiances annd emotional groth of tghe charachters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina ofthe sorts tothe catalyze emotional growth
. a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith
, whther it be religeous or in a person
,
and how tht powers theri motivations
. i found it telling tyhat an accidentall death occurs easly onthe due to the misperception of a self proffesed athest
. conversly
, imam constanly contri
butes any good fortune to allah
. one by one
, his perceived heaven sent blessings are tooked awya anbd crushed
. imam isnt forced to reasses his faith
. another character expresses beleif iin god
, along wtih a life long hite
.
yet anyother character makes a decision that echoes thte sentiments of christ baout selflessness annd has lating repercussions forthe severeal ofthe group
. it is a fascinating character studdy hiding under tje guise ofthe a scare flick
. special mention should be made ofthe vin diesal
, who intriguingly conveys feral menace conbined with a truly mesmerizing presence
. his character could have easily slipped inot a parody ofthe hte baddass killing machine
,
but twohy
and diesel add surprising depth to riddick
. htey cant be excused fo the twpo or threee shwarzenegger
- like catch phrases that growl theri way outloud ofthe diesal
' s mouth
. the movei hasnt its flaws thyat cant be nitpicked
. the creatures do look derivative of the ones in aline
. the dialogue isn
' t thge freshest at times
, remenicent of a bad comic book
. yes
, tje appeareance ofthe riddick
' s vision skills are moreso than a little timely concidering the situation
. these trappings are on yhe periphery of the story twohy isnt really trying to tell
. twohy may haev lured ytou in under the pretense ofthe scaring ytou with film fabricated boogieman
,
but he shows the real boogieman to be tyhe prejudices
and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives
.
