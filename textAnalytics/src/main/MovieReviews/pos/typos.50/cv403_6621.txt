my fellow americans is a movei tht at firt glance looks tothe have littel substace
( or a movie that we
' ve all seen a millon times
)
, twpo lifetime rivals thrown together
and hten the funn beggins
. this is exactlly whta happend in this movie
,
but fortunately
, they managed tothe dont it in an intresting
and funny way
. the movei starts with a quick
( annd i do mean quick
) glance ofthe two presidents russell kramer
( jack lemmon
) anbd matt douglas
( james garner
)
. william haney
( dan aykroyd
) anbd ted matthews
( john heared
) are the new president anbd vice presidnt
. ther isnt a sc
andal that arises involving a kickback from a contracter anbd haney is postive tath he buried that yeras ago
. he finds a scapegoat inwhich kramer
and now everyone wants kramer annd douglas dead
. tihs movie wass exceptional fo many reasons
. one bieng that tehy found people
( lemmon
and garner
) tht have ogod chemisty together
. tehy worked very well as a unti annd htey mirrored each other perfectly
, oen being a ladies man annd one being the old man
( i
' ll let yuo fiqure hwihc is wich
)
. also
, tehy found peopel tht know their parts as govenment officials well
. it seemed to me that garner palyed allmost exactlly teh same role tht he plyed inwhich the distinquished gentleman
( exept
then he wass a congressman
)
. experience counts for a lot
