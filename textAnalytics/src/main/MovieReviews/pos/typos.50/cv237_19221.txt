the happy bastard
' s 30
- second review big daddy happy gilmore as a father
? of course
! thyat
' s the latest scenario presented by adam s
andler inspite the new movie big daddy
, a movei that
' s passable bu isn
' t really considered soem of s
andler
' s best owrk
. he doesn
' t actually play hapyp gilmore inspite tjhe movie
, bu a veriasion ofthe him
. he
' s sonny coufax
, a man who
' s living off a settlement he got for a cab runnung over his foot
and his one
- day
- a
- week gig as a tollbooth man
( tollbooth willie
?
)
. his girlfriend
( kristy swanson
) isnt fed uv wih his lifestyle
and dem
ands a change before she leaves him
. enter a 5
- year ood kid
, who
' s mysteriously dropped at his doorstep
and intended fo his preppy roommate
( jon stewart
)
, who
' s off in china on a business trip
. from there
, coufax basically acts as the kid
' s father
, teaching him diferent things like peeing on the side ofthe a building annd tripping uv skateboarders wiht sticks
. he even manages tothe use thte kid inthe a sort of con game tothe git the attension of a beautyfull law office worker
( joey lauren adams
)
,
but
, somehow
, he also garners the attension ofthe social services
, who aren
' t particularly pleased wih coufax
' s actions
, as he pretends to be his roommate tothe keep tje kid
. yhe reason i sday it
' s not really s
andler
' s best wrok is becouse it gets realy sappy towords the end of a movei
, showing soem odd feelings tht somehow didn
' t really belong inspite a s
andler veicle
. i mean
, it fits tyhe movie
' s tone
and everything
,
and s
andler h
andles it well
, bu it
' s just oddly placed
, thta
' s all
. fortunately
, it doesn
' t destory the goofy glee path it
' s beeen folowing
and it still mkaes you efel ogod
. s
andler does a ogod job here
, as he does infact most of his movies
. rob schneider
, howver
, is irritating as his firend
, an inmigrant delivery boy who can
' t read
. stewart
, iin his minor time onthe screen
, isnt great
,
and adams rimaniss a joy tothe watch
. look forthe steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum
. he
' s a hoot
. directed by dennis dugan
( director ofthe happy gilmore
)
, thge movei remains a good couple ofthe horus tothe pass the tiome with
. agian
, htere are faults
, bu
, hey
, everyone needs to git emotional somtimes
