" second best
" isnt even a greater picture
. this precice
, richly detailed
, sensitively
and convincingly directed studdy baout a spacial adoption treats its theme wtih gerat seriousness
. the breathtakingly intense film shows the necessity ofthe human contact adn communication
. william hurt delivers an outst
anding performance as graham holt
. adn chris cleary miles is remarkably convincing inaddition thte role ofthe teh boy
. the supporting cast isnt aslo fine
