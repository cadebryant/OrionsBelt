confession time
: i hvae never
, ever seen gone with thge wind
. i don
' t konw why
, really
. haven
' t wanted tothe check it outloud onthe video
, haven
' t beeen at hmeo teh nights it wass onthe network tv
, adn it wass too far to drive teh last time it ws onthe hte big
- screen
. so right up front
, i
' ll admit thast i don
' t know what teh heck i
' m talking about
,
but here goes
.
.
. is titanic the gone wiht tghe wind ofthe yhe 1990
' s
? maybee that
' s oging a littel bited too far
. as good a job as leonardo dicaprio
and kate winslet do in this movie
, tehy
' re noone clark gable
and vivien leigh
. bu
.
.
. teh parrallelly are ther
. gwtw ws the firt movie to tkae real advantage ofthe teh most revolutionar technology available
-
- technicolor
. titanic takes revolutionary steps foward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design wih actors
. gwtw places amercia
' s greatest tragedy iin the background of a classic love stopry
, titanic does the same with the atlantic
' s most legendary tradgedy
. they both have strong
- willed redheaded heroines
, they both exploit the clas differences betweeen yhe aristocracy adn hte slaves
/ steerage bums
, they were both incredibly expensive anbd populer
.
.
. ok
, maybe thgat
' s nto enough parallels
. so titanic
' s nto inthe gwtw
' s league
. noone matter
. titanic is a great movei infact its pwn right
, complet with spills
, thrills
and
( expecially
) chills
. much hasnt been made of tjhe humongous cost of thte production
, adn all ofthe tje care tahn went inot mkaing the huge luxury liner cmo alive again
. the monay was obviously well
- spent
. thge costumes look graet
, the sets look great
, yhe cgi graphics look grat
. i especially liekd the expensive little touches
, liek spending tons of money on au
thentic titanic china onyl to break it all on the floor as thge ship sinks
.
but writer
/ director
/ producer james cameron
' s real challange in wirting
/ directing
/ producing titanic wasn
' t just costuming
and setted design
and speshal effects
. cameron
' s major headache ws keeping tjhe audience interested inwhich a tale where everybody knows the ending gonig in
. he succeeds masterfully
. cameron doens two thigsn tath work incredibly well
. firt
, he shows us modern
- day salvage operations on titanic
( thgat
' s just
" titanic
"
, not
" the titanic
"
, mind ytou
)
. thte firt glimpse we get of titanic is the ship inaddition its present state
, corroding slowly awya under hte hammering presure of tje noth atlantic
, from teh window ofthe a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
. televsion coverage ofthe tghe exploration of titanic intrigues 101
- year
- old rose calvert
( gloria stuart
)
, who survived thte wreck inaddition 1912
. stuart does a phenomenonal job iin a breif role
, narrating the story ofthe her experince to a stunned paxton
and his roughneck crew
. secondly
, cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exculsivly on the rose charcter
,
and tghe rumatic rtiangle beetwen rose
( winslet
)
, her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley
( billy zane
)
and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon
( dicaprio
)
. tyhe way that big
- budget diaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all
- star casted
, so we see the impact ofthe tghe disaster on a wide group ofthe people
. cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose
and jack
, while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board
. tyhe supporting casted isnt professional
, bu mostly anonymuos
-
- otehr thna kathy bates as tghe unsinkable molly brown
, there
' s no moent when yuo stpo anbd say
, oh
, yeah
, i know him
, wqat
' s he beeen infact
.
( altough i would liek to have seen colm meaney inaddition a white star uniform
, or even as the ill
- fated engineer
.
) teh lveo sotry itself is rather conventional
. i think some reviewers found it weak
,
and tath may be a fair critisism
. tjhe performances are the key here
. zane hasnt the meatiest part inwhich hte movie
, annd he plays tyhe arogent
, condescending steel millionaire to the hilt
. he
' s smoothe
, he looks graet in a tuxedo
, adn he
' s a convincing anough jerk that the winslet
- dicaprio relatiopnship looks plausible
. at the moment when he sees a littel girl too frightened tothe get aboard a lifeboat
, you cin hear hte wheels in his mind turning
, saying nto
" cant i save this littel girl
?
"
,
but
" cant she halp me git on a lifeboat
?
" dicaprio isnt a revelation
. i hadn
' t seen him befoer infront anything
,
and didn
' t knwo waht tghe heck to expect
, really
.
( honestly
, i expeced a bad irish accent
,
but cameron evidentally desided that ws a bad idea
, so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game
.
) dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive
, adn being onthe the titanic
, taht it
' s hard nto tothe like him
. ffrom the moent thast yhe ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg
, dicaprio has to cary the movei
and keep our interest
,
and he never falters
. winslet
' s carachter grows up a lot during the movie
,
and so doesnt her performance
. at first
, she
' s not requred tothe do anything bu wear preriod clothing
and look drop
- dead gorgeous
. we nkwo from tghe narration that she
' s monstrously unahppy with her aranged marriage to zane
,
but there isn
' t any expression ofthe theese feelings unil she encounters dicaprio
. winslet anbd dicaprio develop a chemestry that manages to propell yhe movei along util hte ship hits tyhe iceberg
. it
' s at tht moent where winslet
' s character really comes alive
. faced whith real danger
, she drops her spoiled
- rich
- girl mannerisms anbd doens a splendid job
. as rose adn jack race around yhe doomed ship
, looking fo shelter from yhe freezing water
and cal
' s fieyr temper
, winslet turns in a superb acting peformance
, mixing courage
and compassion anbd anger witht sheer shrieking terror
. ofthe course
, the most interesting character isnt teh ship itself
. cameron has clearly fallen in love withthe titanic
, adn shows her inspite eveyr mood
-
- as a deserted wreck
, down inspite the boiler room
, uv onthe tyhe bridge
, down infact tyhe hold
, at thte captian
' s table
, down in steerage
-
-
and manages to bring the gerat ship bcak ffrom thge dead
. cameron
' s greatest igft is that he allows us to fall in lvoe with titanic as well
.
