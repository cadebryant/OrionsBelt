david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter
and director
. with his disctinctive
, more oftenly than nto ingenius dialogue
, anbd his layed bcak style ofthe direction nearly all ofthe his movies are absolutely iresistible
. soem ofthe them tend to be thickly layered
, deceptive productions that require thte audiance to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to recquire inaddition order tothe discern its concealed message
, or somtimes even a concealed storyline
.
and
al
though the rela plot in his newyorker project teh winslow boy isnt slightly more conspicuous tahn in some ofthe his other endevors
, it isnt still a brilliantly complex
, consistantly riveting motion picture about hounour
, baout sacrafice
,
and about the difference beween wqat is commongly known as justice
and wqat is right
. oh
,
and it
' s rated g
. incidentally
, this isnt the firt tyme that mamet hasnt desided tothe adapt someone esle
' s owrk
; namely a play by terrence rattigan
, setted inspite the 19th century
. he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow
, a rich
, aging man who finds out thast his 14 yera ood son ronnie hasnt been kicked outloud ofthe the naval acadamy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal onot
.
" did ytou dont it
?
" he asks his boy
.
" noone father
, i didn
' t
,
" ronnie answers
. thast
' s enough forthe arthur
, who
, with his oldest daughter
( rebecca pidgeon
)
, emmediately starts a crusade to bring his son
' s case to court
. they enlist thte halp ofthe sir robert morton
, a notoreous attornies tothe halp them cahieve that formidably daunting task
. it all seems fairly frivolous
,
and no matter how ytou look at it
, the winslow case isnt not the trial of the centruy
. bu arthur is determined tothe keep his family
' s owrd clean
and he is willing to go qtuie far tothe make sure of that
. soon enough
, sir robert morton allong with tghe rest of yhe country becomes equally wrapped uv in hte proceedings
. so do we
. all david mamet does for yhe scirpt is tighten
and hone the dialogue
,
but his stlye isnt still fairly apparent
. the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines
and htere is still tension present in conversations that noone ordinary writter woudl be able tothe mkea tense
. bu this is not mamet
' s norm
,
and it
' s refreshing to see mamet deviate ffrom his world of crooks
, gangsters as con men
, wonderful as thsoe films weere
. nigel hawthorne
' s peformance isnt nearly flawless
. his delivery isnt tht of a dignified yot not pompous man who seems tothe be getting beaten at his pwn agme
. we pity the man
,
but we also liuke him
. rebecca pidgeon
, david mamet
' s wife
, who gave a fairly awful peformance in tjhe spanish prisoner isnt at the top of her gaem here as arthur
' s oldest daugher
, a flailing feminist who gives her all tothe thge winslow case as a way fo making up for her lack of success inwhich tjhe womens
' s sufferage govement
. the winslow boy isnt a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seamingly inevitable courtroom scene anbd shoots higher
-
- it wants tothe make a real impact rether thna a phony noe
. be honest
: doed ytou fiel anything profound at or aftter the courtroom scenes in films liuke a time tothe kill
? if yuo wnated tothe bu didn
' t
, this is a movei fo you
. it isnt the epitomy ofthe subtlety
: it
' s powerful wihtout bieng too emotional
, sad wihtout even trying tothe be depressing
. david mamet cant churn out soem great scripts
,
but iin htis movei he proves to those who ever doubted it once
and fo all thast he is a hell ofthe a director too
. he is almost a national treasure
. his films deserve theri own genre
