david mamet has long been my favorite screenwrighter
and director
. with his disctinctive
, omre oftenly than nto ingenious dialogue
,
and his laid back style ofthe direction nearly all ofthe his movies are absolutly irresistible
. smoe ofthe them tend tothe be thickly layered
, deceptive productions thast recquire hte audience tothe look at the film inaddition a less superficial manner than tyhe plot seems to require inaddition order to discern its concealed message
, or sometimes even a concealed storyline
.
anbd altho yhe rela plot in his new project teh winslow boy isnt slightly more conspicuous than in some ofthe his other endevors
, it isnt still a brilliantly complex
, consistantly riveting motion picture baout honor
, about sacrifice
,
and about tjhe diference vetween what isnt commonly known as justice
and what is right
. oh
,
anbd it ' s rated g
. incidentally
, htis isnt the first tyme that mamet hasnt decided tothe adapt someone alse ' s work
; namely a play by terrence rattigan
, set in hte 19th centruy
. he casts nigel hawthorne iin the lead role as arthur winslow
, a rich
, aging man who finds outloud that his 14 yera old son ronnie has beeen kicked out of tjhe naval aacdemy forthe allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note
.
" did you dont it
?
" he asks his boy
.
" noone father
, i didn ' t
,
" ronnie answers
. tath ' s anough for arthur
, who
, whith his oldest daugter
( rebecca pidgeon
)
, immediately starts a crusade to bring his son ' s case tothe court
. they enlist thge help of sir robert morton
, a notorius attornies tothe halp them achieev that formidably daunting task
. it all seems fairly frivolous
,
anbd no marter how you look at it
, hte winslow case isnt not the trial ofthe the century
.
but arthur is determined tothe keep his famaly ' s owrd clean
anbd he is willing tothe go quite far tothe make sure of that
. soon enough
, sir robert morton along iwth the rest of tjhe country becomes equally wrapped up inthe tje proceedings
. so dont we
. all david mamet doesnt fo the scirpt isnt tighten
anbd hone the dialogue
,
bu his style isnt still fairly apparetn
. tje characters still talk inaddition his trademark staccatto lines
and there isnt still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense
.
but this is not mamet ' s norm
,
annd it ' s refreshing tothe see mamet deviate from his world ofthe crooks
, gangsters as con men
, wonderfull as thsoe films weere
. nigel hawthorne ' s performance is nearly flawless
. his delivery isnt that ofthe a dignified
yot nto pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game
. we pity tjhe man
,
but we aslo liek him
. rebecca pidgeon
, david mamet ' s wife
, who gavey a fairly awful performence in hte spanish prisoner is at tje top ofthe her game here as arthur ' s oldest daughter
, a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way fo making up for her lack of success infact the women ' s sufferage movment
. the winslow boy isnt a wonderfull movei thgat avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevatible courtroom scene
annd shoots heigher
-
- it whants tothe mkae a rela impact rather than a phony oen
. be honest
: did you fiel anytying profound at or aftter the courtroom scenes infront films like a tiome tothe kill
? if yuo wnated tothe
but didn ' t
, tihs isnt a movei for ytou
. it is tjhe epitome ofthe subtlety
: it ' s powerful wihtout being too emotional
, sad wihtout even trying to be depressing
. david mamet can churn outloud smoe great scripts
,
bu inwhich tihs movei he proves tothe thsoe who ever doubted it once
and fo all thta he isnt a hell of a director too
. he is almsot a national treasure
. his films deserve theri pwn genre
