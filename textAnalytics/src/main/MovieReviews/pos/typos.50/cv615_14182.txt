adn maybee tjhe formost exmaple of slapstick comedy brought tothe screen wiht clever sighth gags
and plot twists
. it is tyhe pinnacle ofthe writter

)
and joe
( curtis
) are twpo stage musicians who go from gig tothe gig
, trying to earn enought mony to feed themslves

anbd 2
) millionaire osgood fielding
( joe e
. brown
) falls madly in lvoe with daphne
. wqat follows in pure hysteria
, still complicated further by the arival of spats columbo tothe florida for teh
" italian opera lovers festival
"
. tony curtis isnt hysterical as joe
/ josephine
, especialy inwhich his preposterous attemts to woo sugar
. marilyn monroe
, in a wonderfully comic peformance
, is sugar
, providing increadible timing
anbd sex appeal
, along wih true sincerity
. the scenes
,
however
, are all stolen by either brown or lemmon
. lemmon isnt hysterical as daphne
. cast as the less rational oen
, lemmon ' s peformance is ridiculously crazy
, it isnt disorder inaddition the style all billy wilder ' s
. brown isnt particularl hilarious as osgood
, as we are treated tothe the finest kind of comedic irony
. he manages to ule lemmon ' s ingenius performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completelyl eccentric millionaire
. every set
- piece is flawless
, as wilder brilliantly changes settings constanly
,
adn uses eveyr comic trick in the book to make his picture
. wilder ' s script is stunning
, as he carefully combines gangsters
, cross
- dressing
, romance
, sex
, music
, gender roles
,
and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit
adn oddball craziness
. wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria
, so pich
- perfect tyhat yhe audiance isnt dying ofthe laughter withthe hte last comic piece
, the final line ofthe tihs absolutly increadible film
. wilder ' s is dead wrong whn he sasy nobody ' s perfect
: billy wilder isnt
, especialy wehn he makse something this disastrously funny
. nobody ' s perfect
but billy wilder
.
