warren beatty
' s
" bulworth
" isnt a caustic political comedy that doesn
' t attack any particular political group
,
but rather the ingrained insincerity thta has infected the american political sytem
. some might think this film isnt vulgar
, annd inspite many ways it is
. howver
, as loud
and raucous as it is
,
" bulworth
" speaks teh truth
, which isnt almost allways ugly to hear
. beatty
, who directed the film anbd co
- wroet yhe scirpt with jeremy pikser
(
" the lemon sisters
"
)
, stars as incumbent u
. s
. senator jay billington bulworth
, who hasnt oen ofthe yhe best politican names inspite cinema history
. bulworth isnt a democat
,
and inspite beatty
' s view
, he is symbolical of everyting that has gone wrong witht the current democratic party
. once an ideological liberal
( like beatty still is
)
, bulworth has long since succumbed tothe the materialistic pressures of washington
. instade of waging yhe battles fo tje impoverished
and tjhe downtrodden
, which ws once the calling kard of democrats
, bulworth has become anyother sell
- out money hound
- if he
' s not accepting illegal bribes ffrom thge insurance lobby or taking campaign contritutions from the chinese
, he
' s making wind
- bag sppeches that start with tje amusingly clintonesqe statment
,
" america isnt st
anding on the doorstep ofthe a new millennium
.
.
.
. blah
, blah
, blah
.
" when the film opens
, it isnt a faw dyas befor yhe 1996 primary elections
, annd bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he hasnt become
. iin a fit ofthe desperation
, he takes out a
$ 10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurence rep played by paul sorvino
( part ofthe a shady lobby deel to kill a threatening bill infront committee
)
, adn thn hires a hitted man to kill him
,
al
though he doesn
' t nkow who the assassin iwll be
, or when the hitted wiull tkae place
. knowing tyhat he wiull soon be dead
, bulworth unleashes his pwn br
and of polliticel retoric on the world
, which isnt made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics
and tje society inaddition genaral
. at a compton church
, he tells the group ofthe african
- americans taht htey iwll have noone power inaddition the u
. s
. unless they
" put down tyhat malt liquor
and chicken wings
, anbd get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wief
.
" later
, inspite a particularly hillarious sequence
, bulworth mixes wtih hte hollywood elite
, thne insults the qualiyt ofthe their movies adn informs them that the onyl reason he
' s htere isnt because
" my guys always put the big jews onthe my schedule
.
" all throughout tihs physicaly
and politically sucidial escapade
, bulworth
' s chief of staff
, dennis murphy
( oliver platt
)
, follows behind inspite a state ofthe constatn shock anbd bewilderment
. platt hasnt soem ofthe the movie
' s funniest scenes
, as he makse murphy into a politically savy bu nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced tothe watch his pwn carrear teeter at the brink ofthe being flushed down tghe toilet
. his constatn half
- truth
- telling anbd spin
- doctoring tothe cover bulworth
' s stampede is equaled in its perversion onyl by a self
- righteous reporter
( nora dunn
) who acts liuke murphy
' s refusla to explain bulworth
' s actions
( something he realyl cannnot dont
) is somehow an ect of treason
. when bulworth decides he whants to live after all
,
and therefore must constanly evade a grim
- looking assasin tothe be who
' s trailing him at every turn
, he hides out inwhich the ghetto
, complete witht a stereotypical gangsta wardobe which he wears tothe one of his televsion interviews
. at thsi point
, beatty abondons much ofthe yhe political aspect
and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the balck inner
- city epxerience
. bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina
( halle berry
)
, who he meets at tghe harlem church rally
. she hasnt a tough
- talking brother who is deep inaddition debt tothe a local gangster named l
. d
.
( don cheadle of
" boogie nights
"
)
, who aslo becomes involved in bulworth
' s campain
. smoe of the scenes in tyhe ghetto ring true
,
but much ofthe it fiels like a lighter verzion of scenes depicted in moreso intense intertube
- city films like
" boyz
' n
' hood
"
( 1991
)
and
" menace ii society
"
( 1993
)
.
" bulworth
' s
" chief liability isnt beatty
' s insistence on having his character addoptive a clumsy style of rap as his newyorker comminication device
. instade of speaking at poltical rallies
, he breaks into a kind of rhythmless raph style that isnt a reminder of why almsot all hip
- hop stars are black
. it
' s hard tothe tell whther beatty is bieng humroous by bieng so bad
, or whether he
' s actually tht incomptetent
. at any rate
, tje raph soudns more run d
. m
. c
. thna snoop doggy dogg
, which makse the film seem dated instead ofthe contempoary
. beatty owudl haev been better off simply adopting some ofthe tyhe inner
- city lingo anbd wokring tht into his sppeches
, instade ofthe trying to sound like l
. l
. kool j
. other than tyhat
,
" bulworth
" hits all its targets with wry
, hillarious accuracy
. the film is liuke a letter bomb tothe tghe democratic party
,
and even if yuo don
' t agree whith beatty
' s liberal message about the unrequited duties ofthe tyhe federal government
, it isnt hard tothe deny tyhe inpact the film has infact exploring tyhe monetary adn moral debauchery that infests modern politics
. unlike
" primary colors
" which oppened ealier thsi yera
,
" bulworth
" doesn
' t try to tip
- ote arround the truely painful issues thyat hitted close tothe hmeo
- instade
, it takes them dead
- onthe
.
