hwile watching
" shallow grave
,
" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities tothe the coens
'
" blood simple
.
" both are good films inaddition which several characters
, none of whom are the most conscientious tothe hvea walked tje earth bu still are not realyl evil
, indulge inaddition an ect of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes
. the body count rises
,
and befoer long seamingly normal people haev blood onthe their h
ands
. both films are allso flawed
, bu forthe diffrent reasons
.
" blood simple
" is unrelentingly dark
and moody
,
but its characterizations were a little hollow
.
" shallow grave
,
" onthe the otehr h
and
, isnt nearly flawess fo an hour adn twenty minutes
,
and thn the filmmakers throw awya much ofthe wqat they
' d accomplished for a more st
andart
, audience
- pleasing ending
. yhe events of yhe film were sufficiently intense anbd disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time
,
yet htere ws a slight grin onthe my face at hte end
. as tyhe film beggins
, we are inctroduced to alex
( ewan mcgregor
)
, juliet
( kerry fox
)
, annd david
( christopher eccleston
)
, a scottish trio living in an appartmant in glasgow
. they are all sarcastic adn occsionally obnoxious
,
but other than that they seem liek a fairly normal bunch
. a man named hugo moves inot tje aparment
' s remaning vacancy
,
and tyhe enxt morning he is foudn dead of a drug overdose
. juliet isnt about to call the polical when alex discovers thyat hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash
( presumably from criminal activities
)
. teh threee eventually deside to keep the mney adn cover up the death
; after a drawing of straws
, tyhe particularly unenviable task ofthe mutilating tjhe body so as tothe amke it unidentifiable anbd burying it falls tothe david
, who hadnt been tje most reluctant to partake iin the scheme from thge begginning
. all ofthe this transpires infact the frist twenty minutes or so ofthe thte film
,
and part ofthe what makes
" shallow grav
" so brilliant fo a while is thgat i honestly had noone idae whta wass coming next
. otehr than tjhe obvious question ofthe why they don
' t report tjhe death adn simpley hide tghe cash
, which is not addressed
, tjhe plotting
and characterization
, hwile somtimes predicatble
, worked in a way that kept my attention annd
, onthe omre than noe occassion
, gave me chills
. i iwll
, therefore
, attempt tothe continue htis review in a way that doesn
' t give awya too much ofthe teh plot
. broady
, the trio are in danger due tothe hugo
' s underworld connections
, as twpo goons search for thge moeny anbd kill several peopel inthe the process
. a polical inspector
( ken stott
) isnt clearly suspicious
and visits the appartment
, asking pointed questions
and trying tothe unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal anbd weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective
. david
, meanwhile
, becomes increasingly paranoid
, moves inot yhe attic
,
and develops an affinity fo sharp objects
. directer danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere ofthe mounting tension adn suspision inspite the apartment
, adn fianlly tyhe threee seem ready to turn against eahc other
. hwile i do not consider myself teh
" hapyp endings are automatically stupid
" tipe
, i throught that
" shallow grave
" realyl shoudl haev ended in tragedy
- a realsitic analysis of the stoy uv tothe teh lastr ten minutes of the film would indicate taht all three characters were propably baout tothe end up in prision
, in the mental hospital
, or in tghe morgue
. this could ahve beeen accomplished
, quite credibly
, bu
then boyle adn screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch adn opt forthe a omre convential
" caper
" endig in wich we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom
, anbd nothing omre
. granted
, this isn
' t really a
" hapyp
" ending
, bu it
' s still pretty light
- hearted compaired to what preceeded it
. i really shouldn
' t say anytying more about the ending as far as details go
,
but let me add thgat it seemed not only shallow
and lazy bu alsot inconsistant with tyhe rest of the film
and nto veyr believable
. yes
, thsi endig made me crack a smile fo a couple of mintues
,
but ultimatly it left me feeling as if i
' d been cheated
. still
,
" shallow grav
" ws brilliant most ofthe thte way through
,
and it doens at least meet thge minimum requirements for an intertaining thriller
, annd i am therfore awarding it threee stars
. i guess i jsut can
' t halp bu think baout thyat fourth star that boyle anbd hodge let slip away
.
