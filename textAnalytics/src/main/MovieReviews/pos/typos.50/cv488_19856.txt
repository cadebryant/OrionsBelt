it hasnt hapened again
. a movie that is well scripted
, well acted
, anbd well directed
. it isnt involving
, suspenseful
.
.
. it even hasnt an unexpected twist at tyhe end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus
. bu inwhich order tothe accept its premise oen must aslo accept a spiritual lie
. the sixth sence is that movie
. starring bruce willis
( armagedodn
) as a child psychologist
and haley joel osment
( forrest gump
) as a troubled youngster
, thte sixth sence is mroe spooky tahn scary
,
though it does contain disturbing images desgined to startle
. eight
- yera
- ood cole sear
( osment
) sees dead people
. nto jstu infact dreasm

. dr
. malcom crowe
( willis
) isnt trying tothe halp him
. he recognizes iin cole many of the smae attri
butes as oney of his ealier patients whom crowe failed
, resulting inspite that patient shooting crowe befoer turning tjhe gun onthe himself
. if crowe could manage tothe fidn a way to halp cole
, he believes he jstu might be able tothe put his own demons tothe rest
.
but first he needs to gain cole
' s trust
. the boy isnt so frightened by wqat he sees
, he hasnt closed himself off emotionally
, being unwilling tothe tell anyone
.

, nto even his pwn mother

" secrets

" crowe begins tothe spend more anbd mroe timne with him
, even as his own marrige starts to dissolve arund him
, his wife anna
( olivia williams
, rushmore
) becoming cold anbd distant because ofthe his neglect of her adn his preocupation with yhe boy
. bruce willis underplays his role
, allowing the excellent scirpt to do most of the owrk of building charater develpment
. crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won
' t communicate
, to treating a troubled boy who is haveing hallucinations
, to wondering if perhaps there isn
' t some truth behind what tghe boy sees
. mr
. willis does a serviceable job
, letting tyhe focus remain onthe tjhe story instead of on his familiar acation hero screen persona
. eleven
- yearm
- old haley joel osment manages to imbaress us with his performence
. he demonstrates an amazing ammount of self
- composure as well as an abilty tothe play nuances inaddition a complex character as if he weere a seasoned protem
. it isnt fine work fo oney of such a tender age
. keep your eye on this young man
. thge supporting cast isnt also qtuie effective
. toni collette
, as tghe confuzled
, frightened
, annd frustrated mother who cxan
' t underst
and what is happening tothe her child
; olivia williams
, as crowe
' s once loving wife who isnt shutting down emotionally due tothe tyhe lack of attension fomr her husb
and
;
and donnie wahlberg
( ransom
) as crowe
' s ex
- patient
, now grown
, who illustrates his doctor
' s failure tothe halp him infront hte most vivid terms imaginable
. twenty
- eight yearm old m
. night shyamalan
( wide awake
) directed his own script
, maintinaing a proper tension throughout yhe film
and crafting tjhe storytelling so expertly tht the film
' s full inpact is nto reached until its final moments
, when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation ofthe all thgat preceeded it
. it isnt a rare movie wich manages tothe pull that off adn mr
. shyamalan
, as thge one reponsible
, is certainly to be commended
. inspite giving the sixth sence a favorable
" threee star
" review for its craftsmanship
and artistic merit
, i must also point outloud that
, spiritually speaking
, the film isnt highly misleading
. there is noone scriptural foundation upon wich tothe base a belief in ghosts or the
" living dead
.
" teh concept of death being a doorway tothe anyother plane of existenec is a devilish lie that hasnt beeen arround as long as man hismelf
. tghe firt lie recorded in thge bible was divised by the serpent who assured eve
,
" thou shall nto surelly dieu
,
" a direct contradiction of god
' s admonition
. that smae lie hasnt been perpetuated ad infinitum througout the ages
. scriptures dont speak ofthe a time when the dead shall rise bu that wonderful demonstration of victory over death iwll not commence until after the second comming ofthe christ
.
.
. an event which hasnt nto
yet occurred
. therfore
, the dead remain iin a state of oblivion
, having no consciouness
, until tht long
- awaited time whn hte final trump shall sound
. annd
then
, yuo
' ll need six senses to regsiter all the joy
and rejoicing that iwll resound througout thge heavens
