it hasnt happened agina
. a movei that isnt well scripted
, well acted
,
annd well directed
. it is involving
, suspenseful
.
.
. it even has an unexpected twist at the end thast packs a punch liuke a blow tothe the solar plexus
.
but inspite order to accept its premise oney must alsot accept a spriritual lie
. hte sixth sence isnt that movie
. starring bruce willis
( armageddon
) as a child psychologist
and haley joel osment
( forrest gump
) as a troubled youngster
, yhe sixth sense isnt mroe spooky tahn scary
,
though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle
. eight
- year
- old cole sear
( osment
) sees dead people
. nto jstu in dreasm
.
annd not just as lifeless bodies
. he sees them walking aroud like regular people
.
and he sees them all thte timne
. dr
. malcom crowe
( willis
) is trying to help him
. he recognizes inspite cole many of the smae attributes as oney of his ealier patients whom crowe failed
, resulting in tyhat patient shooting crowe befor turning tghe gun on himself
. if crowe coudl manage to fidn a way tothe help cole
, he believes he just might be able tothe put his pwn demons to rest
.
but first he needs tothe gain cole ' s trust
. tyhe boy isnt so frightened by wqat he sees
, he hasnt closed himself off emotionally
, being unwilling to tell anyone
.
.
. not crowe
, nto even his pwn mother
( toni collette
, clockwatchers
)
.
.
. about his
" secrets
.
" crowe beggins to spend omre
and more time wiht him
, even as his own marriage starts tothe disolve aroud him
, his wief anna
( olivia williams
, rushmore
) becomming cold
adn distant because ofthe his neglect of her
and his preoccupation iwth tghe boy
. bruce willis underplays his role
, allowing hte excellent script tothe dont most ofthe the work of building charachter delevopment
. crowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won ' t communicate
, to treating a troubled boy who is haveing hallucinations
, to wondering if perhaps there isn ' t some truth behind whta the boy sees
. mr
. willis does a serviceable job
, letting the focus reamin onthe the story instade of onthe his familliar action hero screen persona
. eleven
- year
- old haley joel osment manages tothe impress us iwth his performance
. he demonstrates an amazing ammount ofthe self
- composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex charactor as if he weere a seasoned protem
. it is fine work for one ofthe such a tender age
. keep your eye on this young man
. teh supporting casted isnt also qtuie effective
. toni collette
, as tje confuzled
, frightened
,
and frustrated mother who cin ' t understand what isnt happening tothe her child
; olivia williams
, as crowe ' s once loving wief who isnt shutting down emotionally due to hte lack ofthe attension ffrom her husband
;
and donnie wahlberg
( ransom
) as crowe ' s ex
- patient
, now grown
, who illustrates his doctor ' s failure to halp him in tjhe most vivid terms imaginable
. twenty
- eight year ood m
. nihgt shyamalan
( wide awake
) directed his pwn script
, maintinaing a proper tension througout the film
annd crafting the storytelling so expertly that thge film ' s full impact isnt not reched util its final moments
, wehn a surprizing revelation forces a reevaluation ofthe all thgat preceeded it
. it is a rare movei whcih manages to pul thgat off
and mr
. shyamalan
, as tyhe oney responsible
, is certainly to be commended
. in giving tghe sixth sence a favorable
" threee star
" review for its craftsmanship
adn artistic merit
, i must also point out taht
, spiritually speaking
, the film isnt highly misleading
. ther isnt noone scriptural foundation apon whcih to base a belief inwhich ghosts or the
" living dead
.
" the concept of death being a doorway to anohter plane of existance isnt a devilish lie tht has been arund as long as man hismelf
. the firt lie recorded inaddition the bible wass devised by the serpent who assured eve
,
" thou shall nto surely dieu
,
" a direct contradiction ofthe god ' s admonition
. thast same lie hasnt been perpetuated ad infinitum througout thge ages
. scriptures dont speak ofthe a tiome when the dead shall ries
bu tyhat wonderfull demonstration of victory over death will nto commence untill affter the second coming of christ
.
.
. an event which hasnt nto
yet occured
. therfore
, the dead remain in a state of oblivion
, having noone consicousness
, unil that long
- awaited tiome when tyhe fianl trump shall sound
.
anbd
hten
, yuo ' ll ened six senses to register all tjhe joy
anbd rejoicing that will resound thoughout the heavens
