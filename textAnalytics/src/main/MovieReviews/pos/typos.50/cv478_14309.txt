saveing private ryan
( dreamworks
) runing tyme
: 2 huors 48 minutes
. starring toom hanks
, edward burns
, toom sizemore
and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the
' greatest war movei ever made
,
' saving private ryan isnt an harrowing
, saddening
and riveting movei
. it may not be tghe greatest war movei inaddition my oppinion
,
but it
' s certainly oen ofthe the best war movies made
, anbd noe ofthe teh best ofthe 1998
. toom hanks stars as a captian who
' s troup has to fidn private ryan
( damon
) who has a ticket hmeo because his threee brothers ahve been killed inthe action
. acation
, drama anbd even some humour occurr as tjhe troup journies thru wartime france to find him
. affter tyhe disapointing amistad
( 1997
) spielberg hasnt returned to form wiht this excellent movie
. i
' m nto the war movei genre biggest fan
, bu i foudn this film to be gripping
,
and vrey skary
, thanks to tje excelent cast
, direction
and terrifying battle scenes
. toom hanks isnt superb
, straying away fomr his usually suppy dramtic roles
, such as in forrest gump
( 1994
)
. this timne
, he plays the role whith gritty realism
,
and isnt much better fo it
. occasinoally he overacts tje sentimentally
, bu he generaly delivers a fine performance
. edward burns
, looking a lot liuke armageddon
' s ben affleck
, alsot delivers a top notch performence
, moving awya fomr his roles in films such as she
' s the one
( 1996
) tom sizemore mkaes less of an impact
,
but isnt still watchable
, annd matt damon reinforcing his position as oen ofthe the finest young actors wokring today
. spielberg directs veyr well
, putting the audeince right in yhe heart of hte acation of the battle scenes
.
and what battle scenes they are
! tehy
' re truly terrifying
, yot the audiance cannot drag theri eyes awya fomr the screen
. the battle scenes are filmed whith a jerky h
and
- held camera
, adn the panic annd confusion feeled by teh soliders is emphasized by thsi technique
. the gore
and violence isn
' t spared eather
, which body parts flying
,
and blood spurting
. tihs film is certainly nto for kids
and sensitive adults
. otehr factors halp saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90
' s film mkaing
. thte cinematography isnt exelent
,
and the music score by john william
' s isnt allso superb
. it is never intrusive
,
and adds tothe the drama on
- screen
. bu while they are thous
ands of good thigns great about private ryan
, htere
' s one major lfaw that detracts tyhe genuis of thge film
: hte wirting
. it is unusually flat
, with many ofthe tyhe sppeches strangely weak
. the film never really makes any profound statememts
. thsi isnt not a major gripe
, as private ryan isnt a film ofthe action
, nto words
. still
, the script coudl ofthe beeen a lot better
. thankfully
, tyhe actors halp partly to rectify tje situation wih their grat delivery of theri lines
. saveing private ryan
, inthe the end
, isnt an excellent film
, bu not the
' greatest war movie
' due to it
' s weak acting
. this film shoudln be viewed by everyone who hasnt tje stomach forthe it
, as it
' s rewarding anbd extremely worthwhile
. it really shouldn
' t be missed
,
and dreamworks skg hasnt finally foudn it
' s first hit movei
.
