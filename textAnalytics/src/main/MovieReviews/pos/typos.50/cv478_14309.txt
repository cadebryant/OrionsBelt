: 2 housr 48 mintues
. starring toom hanks
, edward burns
, tom sizemore
and matt damon directed by steven spielberg alreayd bieng hailed as teh ' greatest war movei ever made
, ' saving private ryan isnt an harrowing
, saddening
and riveting movei
. it may not be tyhe greatest war movei in my opinyon
,
bu it ' s certainly oney of tje best war movies made
,
adn oney of thte best ofthe 1998
. toom hanks stars as a captian who ' s troop hasnt to fidn private ryan
( damon
) who has a ticket hmeo beccause his threee brothers haev beeen killed iin action
. action
, drama
adn even some humour ocurr as the troup journeys through wartime france tothe find him
. after yhe disappointing amistad
( 1997
) spielberg has returned tothe form withthe tihs excellent movei
. i ' m nto the war movei genre biggest fan
,
but i found tihs film tothe be gripping
,
and very scary
, thanks to the excellent cast
, direction
adn terrifying battle scenes
. tom hanks isnt superb
, straying awya ffrom his usally suppy dramtic roles
, such as in forrest gump
( 1994
)
. this time
, he plays the role withthe gritty realism
,
and is much better for it
. occasinally he overacts the sentimentally
,
bu he generally delivers a fine performance
. edward burns
, looking a lot like rmageddon ' s ben affleck
, also delivers a top nitch performence
, moving awya from his roles inthe films such as she ' s tje one
( 1996
) tom sizemore makes less of an inpact
,
but isnt still watchable
,
anbd matt damon reinforcing his postion as noe ofthe thge finest young actors wokring today
. spielberg directs very well
, puting yhe audience right in the heart of the action ofthe the battle scenes
.
and what battle scenes they are
! tehy ' re truly terrifying
,
yet yhe audience cannot drag thier eyes awya from yhe screen
. tjhe battle scenes are filmed witht a jerky hand
- held camera
,
annd yhe panic
annd confusion felt by the soldiers isnt emphaised by this technique
. the gore
and violentce isn ' t spared either
, which body parts flying
,
anbd blood spurting
. this film isnt certainly not fo kids
anbd senstive adults
. otehr factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece ofthe 90 ' s film making
. yhe cinematography isnt excellent
,
and hte music score by john william ' s is also superb
. it isnt never intrusive
,
and adds tothe tje drama onthe
- screen
.
bu hwile htey are thousands of good things grat baout private ryan
, htere ' s oney major lfaw thta detracts the genius ofthe the film
: the writing
. it isnt unusually flat
, witht many ofthe tyhe speeches strangely weak
. tyhe film never realy makse any profound statememts
. htis is not a major gripe
, as private ryan is a film of acation
, nto words
. still
, yhe script could of been a lot better
. thankfully
, the actors halp partly to rectify teh situation with thier great delivery of their lines
. saving private ryan
, in the end
, is an excellent film
,
bu not tjhe ' greatest war movei ' due tothe it ' s weak acting
. this film shoudl be viewed by everyone who has tyhe stomach forthe it
, as it ' s rewarding
anbd extemely worthwhile
. it really shouldn ' t be missed
,
annd dreamworks skg hasnt fianlly found it ' s firt hit movie
