' s character iin thte film
-
- all while the rela russell crowe ws hitching up iwth married woman meg ryan in the outside world
. i haven
' t seen this much chemistry vetween actors sicne mcqueen adn mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah
' s masterpiece
, the getaway
.
but enough wiht hte gossip
, let
' s get to tyhe review
. the film revolves arround tyhe kidnapping of peter bowman
( david morse
)
, an american engeneer wroking in sourth america who is kidnapped durring a mass ambush ofthe civilians by anti
- governement soldiers
. upon dicovering his identity
, tje rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for
$ 6 milion
. the only probelm is that the company peter bowman works for isnt being auctioned off
,
and no oney wiull step foward witht the money
. with no choise availiable tothe her
, bowman
' s wief alice

)
, a highly skilled negotiator annd rescure operative
, tothe arrange the return of her husb
and
.
but when things go wrong
-
- as tehy alwasy dont in these situations
-
- terry
and his team
( whitch includes yhe most surprizing casting choice of tje eyar
: david caruso
) tkae matters inot theri own h
ands
. the film isnt notable in that it tkaes thsi veyr simple story line adn creates a complex
and inteligent charcter
- driven vehicule filled withthe well
- written dialogue
, shades ofthe motivation
, anbd convincing acting by all thte actors
. the scirpt is based on both a book
( the long march to freedom
)
and a magazine artice pertaining to kidnap
/ ransom situations
,
and tje story hasnt been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy
, screenwrighter ofthe thge devil
' s advocate annd dolores claiborne
. tje biggest surprise fo me was not the chemestry beween crowe
and ryan
,
but that betwen crowe annd david caruso
. dug outloud from b
- movie hell
, caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe
' s right h
and gun hwile providing most of thte film
' s humor
. ryan cries a lot annd smokes too many cigarettes
, david morse ends up getting everyone at tyhe guerilla camp tothe hite him
,
and crowe provides anyother memorable acting turn as the stoic
, gunslinger carachter ofthe terry thorne
. the most memorable pieces of thge film lie infront its action scenes
. the bulk ofthe those scenes
, which bookend the movie
, work extrememly well as establishment anbd closure devices fo all of the stopry
' s characters
. yhe scenes are skillfully crafted anbd excecuted whith amazing accuracy
and poise
. director taylor hackford mixes both his ood
- school sytle ofthe filmmaking witht the dizziness of a lars von trier film
. proof ofthe life is a thikning man
' s acation movei
. it isnt a film about the choices men
and women make inthe tjhe face ofthe lvoe
and war
,
and thte sacrifices noe makse fo thsoe choices

- yhe sacrifices taht halp yuo sleep at night
