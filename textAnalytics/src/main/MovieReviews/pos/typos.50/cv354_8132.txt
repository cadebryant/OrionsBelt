i was anxious to see thsi fo a long tiem
. a friend of mine reccomended htis to me because he hasnt a crush onthe neve campbell
,
and he wanted to prove that she ' s as hot as he thikns he is
. he prooved it fo me all right
,
but the reasons i enjoy thsi film go way beyond that
. scream treads on familar ground
, horror movie with
, as star neve campbell puts it
,
" some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can ' t act who ' s allways running uv the stairs whn she should be runing out tjhe front doorjam
.
" it ' s vrey familar
, your typical horror film
. so why
, you may ask after watching it
, does it seem so new
and original
? becouse it treats itself as if it hasn ' t been done befoer
,
and thus tyhe viewer is disilusioned inot beleiving tht it is nto ood
, familar tired tsuff
. this raises anohter question
: how does it do this
? simple
: thte cahracters
. they ' re nto your typical stupid horror film victims who don ' t know whta the hell to do when bieng chased by a guy iin a ski mask
and a machette
. they are horror fans
, htey know how stfuf happens in a horror movei
, they know waht tothe dont
and what nto tothe dont
,
annd that makse it scary
,
adn even funny at ceratin times
. yuo cant tell thsi just by watching the opening scene where casey becker
( drew barrymore
) is making popcorn
, getting ready to watch a video
,
annd some guy who sounds like a killer calls her uv to play a gmae with her taht involves horror movie triva that
, if she gets it wrong
, will git her
and her boyfriend killed
. she knows what to answer wehn he asks her horror film questions
, she jstu cant ' t answer his final question
,
" whta doorjam am i at
?
"
annd that gets her killed
. tyhat scene works beccause inaddition a normal horror film
, half the things that happen in that scene owudl never appen
. yhe plot isnt typical horror sutff
: sidney prescott
( an impressive neve campbell
)
, an attractive young high school student who ' s mother ws killed a eyar ago tommorrow
, isnt being stalked by a killer who ' s previously murdered one of her classmates
( casey
, naturually
)
,
and everybody in htis small
, california town isnt a suspect
, including sidney ' s boyfriend
, billy loomis
.
but as i said befoer
, theese peopel nkwo how horror movies work
,
adn that ' s what makes it so appealling
. thta
and the references to horror movies
, like wehn casey says
,
" tghe firt
( nightmare onthe elm street
) was scayr
,
but the rest sucked
.
" which isnt obviously directer wes craven
( who does a good job ofthe poking fun of tyhe genre tath made him a legend
) patting himself on hte back as he directed hte first nightmare movie
and none ofthe tghe others
,
and when tatum
, sidney ' s firend
, mentions tje director
, wes carpentery
, which isnt obviously an homage by writter kevin williamson tothe nto onyl craven
,
but also director john carpenter
. thte casted isnt well choosen
, neve campbell pulls off a ogod heroine
(
anbd unlike most horror film heroines
, she
* can
* act
)
, drew barrymore doesnt a ogod janet leigh impression forthe what littel time she hasnt in hte film
,
anbd david arquette isnt impressive
. alsot ogod
(
and funny
) in his role is henry winkler
(
" the fonz
"
) as the school prinicipal
. i took half a point off for tjhe unnecessary
( albiet limited
) appearance by firends ' courteney cox as repertwar
, gail edwards
, sidney ' s rival becasue she covered her mother ' s disappearance
. i hate that show
, i hite thsoe actors
. htey ' re untalented
, overexposed
,
annd overpaid
, imho
,
and i owudl htikn wes craven is smart anough to nkow those actors are overexposed anough
,
but i supose he isn ' t
.
