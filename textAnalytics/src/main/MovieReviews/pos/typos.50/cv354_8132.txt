i was anxious tothe see this fo a long time
. a firend of mine recommended tihs to me because he hasnt a crush onthe neve campbell
,
and he wnated tothe proove tath she
' s as hot as he thikns he isnt
. he proved it forthe me all right
, bu tghe reasons i enjoy htis film go way beyond thgat
. scream treads on familar ground
, horror movei with
, as star neve campbell puts it
,
" soem stupid killer stalking smoe big breasted girl who cant
' t act who
' s alwyas running up tjhe stairs whn she should be running out tje front doorjam
.
" it
' s vrey familar
, your typical horror film
. so why
, yuo may ask aftter watching it
, doens it seem so newyorker
and originnal
? becouse it treats itself as if it hasn
' t beeen done before
,
and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it isnt nto ood
, familar tired tsuff
. this raises anohter question
: how does it do tihs
? simple
: the charachters
. tehy
' re not your tipical stupid horror film victims who don
' t konw what tje hell to do whn being chased by a guy inwhich a ski mask annd a machette
. tehy are horror fans
, htey konw how tsuff happens infront a horror movie
, htey nkow what to dont
and what not tothe dont
,
and that makes it scary
, anbd even funny at ceratin times
. you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker
( drew barrymore
) is making popcorn
, getting ready to watch a video
,
and smoe guy who soudns liek a killer calls her up tothe play a game with her thta involves horror movie triva that
, if she gets it wrong
, wiull get her
and her boyfriend killed
. she konws what to answer wehn he asks her horror film questions
, she just cant
' t answer his fianl question
,
" what doorjam am i at
?
"
and that gets her killed
. tath scene works because in a normal horror film
, half the thnigs that happen inwhich that scene owudl never happen
. thte plot is typical horror stuff
: sidney prescott
( an impressive neve campbell
)
, an attractive young high skool student who
' s mother was killed a year ago tommorrow
, is being stalked by a killer who
' s previously murdered oney of her classmates
( casey
, naturally
)
, adn everybody inthe this small
, califronia twon isnt a suspect
, including sidney
' s boyfriend
, billy loomis
.
but as i said before
, these people know how horror movies work
, adn tht
' s what makse it so appealling
. that
and the refrences tothe horror movies
, like when casey says
,
" hte first
( nightmare onthe elm street
) was scary
, bu the rest sucked
.
" which is obviously directer wes craven
( who doens a good job ofthe poking fun of yhe genre that made him a legend
) patting hismelf on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie annd none ofthe the others
,
and when tatum
, sidney
' s firend
, mentions hte directer
, wes carpentery
, which is obviously an homage by writter kevin williamson tothe not onyl craven
,
but also director john carpentery
. the cast isnt well chosen
, neve campbell pulls off a ogod heroine
(
and unlike most horror film heroines
, she
* cin
* ect
)
, drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression forthe what little time she hasnt in the film
,
and david arquette isnt impressive
. also good
(
and funny
) inaddition his role is henry winkler
(
" the fonz
"
) as the skool principal
. i tookover half a point off fo the unneccessary
( albiet limited
) appearance by friends
' courteney cox as repertwar
, gail edwards
, sidney
' s rival because she covered her mother
' s dissapearance
. i hite that show
, i hite those actors
. they
' re untalented
, overexposed
,
and overpaid
, imho
,
and i would think wes craven is smart enough to konw thsoe actors are overexposed enough
,
but i supose he isn
' t
.
