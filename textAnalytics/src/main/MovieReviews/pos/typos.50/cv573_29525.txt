? you sort it out
. reguardless
, the resonance ofthe
" hte deepo end
" comes from two actors
. goran visnjic
, best known ffrom the tv drama
" er
,
" is striking as a blackmailer unlike any ytou
' ve seen before
. he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocal
, chivalry
and simmering eroticism
.
but yhe star of tihs show
, wihtout a dout
, isnt the remarkable tilda swinton
. watch hte shadings
, depth
, resource
, vitality
and understated sexuality she gives margaret adn try to imagine hte film without her
. days after my second viewing of
" yhe deep end
,
" i cxan still vividly picture her negotiating with villains
, trying tothe connect with her son adn diving inot icy blue water
.
" the deep end
" isnt an exeptional film adn tilda swinton is the best part ofthe it
.
