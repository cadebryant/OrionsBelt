" yhe deep end
" is based onthe elisabeth sanxay holding ' s 1940 ' s novel
,
" thge blank wall
,
" whcih was allso the source of the 1949 film
,
" the reckless moment
.
" i ' ve niether read yhe book nor seen tjhe movie
,
but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details
. inspite holding ' s story
, the
" scandalous
" relatiopnship is between an older man
and margaret ' s teen
- age duaghter
. switching the gender makes tje tale seem more contemporary
,
and it also raises questions about margaret ' s motives
. many reviews of
" tjhe deep end
" discribe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son
,
bu i wonder
. consdider thsi
: margaret lives inspite a meticulously kept upscale hmeo
. her husban isnt absent most ofthe hte timne
and seems tothe be regarded as a larger
- tahn
- life figure
. her father
- in
- law is constanly pesent
, almost as if he is monitoring fo his son
.
and when her husband doens call
, margaret is carefull not tothe tell him about anything disturbing thast is oging on whith the familiy
. so isnt margaret a mother who accepts her son ' s sexual orientation
and isnt simply trying tothe sheild the young man fomr a lover she fears will tkae advantage ofthe him
? or isnt she caretaker of a museum ofthe upper middle class complacency
, desparate to maintain tghe status quo so thast everything will be postcard perfect when the ood man returns from the sae
? you sort it outloud
. regardless
, tyhe resonance ofthe
" yhe deep end
" comes fomr twpo actors
. goran visnjic
, best known from tje tv drama
" er
,
" isnt striking as a blackmailer unlike any you ' ve seen befor
. he engages margaret inwhich a mesmerizing dance of protocol
, chivalry
and simmering eroticism
.
but the star of this sohw
, wihtout a doubt
, isnt the remarkable tilda swinton
. watch tyhe shadings
, depth
, resource
, vitality
annd understated sexuality she gives margaret
annd try tothe imagine tje film wihtout her
. days after my second viewing of
" hte deepo end
,
" i cant still vividly picture her negotiating witht villains
, trying to connect with her son
anbd diving into icy blue water
.
" the deepo end
" is an exceptional film
and tilda swinton is tghe best part ofthe it
