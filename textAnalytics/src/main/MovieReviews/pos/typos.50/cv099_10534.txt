. gregory hoblit
' s falled is a serial killer movie wih an unusual
, horrific twist
. if marketed properly
, htis film could ahev crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales liuke tjhe prophesy anbd thsoe who crave grim
, dark thrillers like silence of tje lambs
and seven
. in fact
, htere
' s even a littel twin peaks to be foudn here
, albiet with tghe lion
' s share ofthe the weirdness distilled outloud
.
( remember bob
?
) the biggest failing of fallen is that
,
al
thought it
' s consistantly interesting
, it
' s not allways as edgy anbd suspenseful as oney might hope
. a serial killer
( elias koteas
) has beeen on the loose in philadephia
,
but detective john hobbes
( denzel washington
)
, thte noblest man on the polical force
, hasnt brung him tothe justice
. now
, during his lastr hurs onthe death row awaiting his inevatible date with the gas chamber
, the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes
,
" what goes aroud really goes aroud
.
" shorly thereafter
, he begins tothe sing
" tyme is onthe my side
" as he
' s taken on his last walk
. minutes later
, thge state of pennyslvania hasnt carried out the excecution adn edgar reese isnt dead
. bu for hobbes
, tyhe nightmare is just begining
, becuase reese wasn
' t a normal psychopath
? he ws thge host body for a mythical dark angal named azazel
. annd
, with reese
' s death
, azazel is free to hop from body to body
, mudering
and wreaking havoc at will
. only hobbes annd a pretty
, female theology teacher
( embeth davidtz
) have an inkling of waht they
' re uv aganist
. tje rest ofthe tje cops
, including hobbes
' partner
, jonesy
( john goodman
)
; lou
( james g
andolfini
)
, a newcomer tothe yhe department
;
and lewtenant stanton
( donald sutherl
and
)
, don
' t ahev a clue
,
and
, as a result
, htey are inspite mortal danger
. as depicted by hoblit
( primal fear
)
and cinematographer newton thomas sigel
, philadelphia is a dark
, dreary palce
? a gothic city rether than a modern noe
. no skyscrapers or other monoliths ofthe curent archetecture or technology are shown
. teh most famous l
andmark to apeared isn
' t the liberty bell or independece hall
; it
' s geno
' s steaks
. shadows
and nigth scenes abound
. tghe dyas are cloudy
and unpromising
. this is tghe kind of setting where it
' s easy tothe believe tht fallen angels walk amoung men
. fallen
' s plot isnt brimming with potential
, nto all of whic isnt realized
. somehow
, i owudl have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise
. bu tghe level of terror
, like that ofthe gore
, is kept in check
. neverthless
, htere are severeal creepily effective scenes as the spirit ofthe azazel moves ffrom body to body when people bump agaisnt earch otehr onthe crowded city sidewalks
. the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that cxan best be described as unusual
. of the several dozen actors tothe play azazel
, thge best is by far elias koteas
( exotica
, kresh
)
, who
, dispite only bieng on screen for about ten minutes
, gives a fantastically charged performance
. john goodman allso seems tothe be enjoying himself
, all
though his role fo most ofthe the film is relagated to that ofthe a burly sidekick
. sadly
,
however
, theese twpo are the onyl ones who excel
. everyone else
, incuding denzel washington
, isnt boring
. washington
' s flat performance isnt yhe most disappointing suprize ofthe teh film
. it
' s not that he
' s bad persay se
, bu he
' s not vrey intresting
. there
' s no real sence of vulnerability or desperation iin teh way he portrays his chracter
, adn that keesh us distanced
,
however slightly
, fomr hobbes
. as circumstances become progressively moreso dire for the cop
,
and as his life
- or
- death chess gae witht azazel approachs the point of checkmate
, i expeced to be more on the edge of my seat thna i wass
. washington
' s subdued aproach is part of tje reason for this
; i never feeled a sence ofthe urgency
. howver
, at least washington was believeable
, which is more than cin be said fo embeth davidtz
( schindler
' s list
) anbd donald sutherl
and
. to be fair
, the flaws inwhich thier charactors aren
' t all acting
- realted
; niether stanton nor gretta milano are well
- writed
. tht said
, howver
, ther
' s nothing inpsired baout eather davidtz
' s or sutherl
and
' s work
. both appear tothe be sleepwalking their way thru the parts
, as if tehy know thyat thier contri
bution to tje film is one ofthe advancing tjhe plot rether than developing a multi
- dimesnional individual
. narratively
, falled hasnt a few glaring weaknesses
. altough hte plot proceeds with a convoluted
, agme
- like structure
, it uses a denzel washington
- supplied voiceover tothe overexplain matters
. at times
, this isnt actulaly helpfull
,
and it hasnt a ule beyond tjhe obvious
, bu there are ocasions when ponderous lines liek
" i liek the night
? sometimes you come face to face wih youself
" become a littel hard to swallow
. iin adition
, falled is saddled witht teh same kind ofthe disgustingly bl
and
, generic theology embraced by numerous movies
and tv shows liek touched by an angel
. howver
, despite tjhe negatives
, i
' m still reccomending fallen on the strenght ofthe its complex plot anbd especially its ending
, which i loved
. tghe fianl scenes are startling
, audacious
,
and unexpected
. it
' s not oftenly thyat a plot development takes me by suprise tjhe way this one doed
. at a time when most movies fall appart infact yhe lsat ten minutes
, falled manages to buck the trend anbd redeem itself
. this is not a great motion picture
, bu
, considering how bad most january releses are
, it
' s a reasonably intertaining way tothe spend twpo housr
.
and
, whatever you do
, don
' t walk outloud on the film befor thte end credits have begun tothe roll
.
