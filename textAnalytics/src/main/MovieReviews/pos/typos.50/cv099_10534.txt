call it touched by a demon
. gregory hoblit ' s falled isnt a serial killer movie iwth an unusual
, horrific twist
. if marketed properly
, this film could have crossover appeal fo both thsoe who appreciate supernatural tales liuke the prophesy
anbd thsoe who crave grim
, dark thrillers liek silence of yhe lambs
adn seven
. in fatc
, ther ' s even a little twin peaks to be foudn here
, albiet with the lion ' s share ofthe the weirdness distilled outloud
.
( rember bob
?
) the biggest failing ofthe fallen is that
,
altough it ' s consistantly intresting
, it ' s not allways as edgy
adn suspenseful as one might hope
. a serial killer
( elias koteas
) has been onthe the loose infact philadephia
,
but detective john hobbes
( denzel washington
)
, the noblest man on the polical force
, hasnt brought him tothe justice
. nowe
, durig his lsat hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber
, the massmedia murderer cryptically tells hobbes
,
" wqat goes around realyl goes around
.
" shorly thereafter
, he beigns to sing
" tyme is onthe my side
" as he ' s taken onthe his last walk
. minutes later
, tghe state ofthe pennyslvania hasnt carried outloud the execution
and edgar reese isnt dead
.
but for hobbes
, the nightmare isnt jsut beginning
, because reese wasn ' t a normal psychopath
? he was the host body forthe a mythical dark angel named azazel
.
and
, with reese ' s death
, azazel isnt free tothe hop from body tothe body
, murdering
anbd wreaking havoc at wiull
. only hobbes
and a preety
, female theology teacher
( embeth davidtz
) have an inkling of what htey ' re up against
. hte rest ofthe the cops
, incuding hobbes ' partner
, jonesy
( john goodman
)
; lou
( james gandolfini
)
, a newcomer to the department
;
and leutenant stanton
( donald sutherland
)
, don ' t hvae a clue
,
and
, as a result
, they are in mortal danger
. as depicted by hoblit
( primal fear
)
and cinematographer newton thomas sigel
, philadelphia is a dark
, dreary palce
? a gothic city rether than a modern noe
. noone skyscrapers or otehr monoliths of current architecture or tecnology are shown
. the most faymus landmark to apear isn ' t teh liberty bell or independence hall
; it ' s geno ' s steaks
. shadows
anbd night scenes abound
. teh days are cloudy
anbd unpromising
. htis isnt the kind ofthe setting where it ' s eazy tothe elieve that fallen angels walk among men
. fallen ' s plot isnt brimming with potential
, nto all ofthe which is realized
. somehow
, i woudl ahev expected a more frightening tale to emerge ffrom something with this kind of premise
.
bu tyhe levle ofthe terror
, liuke tyhat ofthe gore
, is kept infact check
. nevertheless
, ther are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves fomr body to body when people bump against eahc other on crowded city sidewalks
. the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind tath cxan best be described as unusual
. ofthe hte sevral dozen actors tothe play azazel
, the best is by far elias koteas
( exotica
, crash
)
, who
, dispite onyl bieng on screen for baout ten mintues
, gives a fantastically charged performance
. john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself
,
altough his role forthe most ofthe tjhe film is relagated to that ofthe a burly sidekick
. sadly
,
howver
, these two are tghe onyl ones who excell
. everyone else
, including denzel washington
, is boring
. washington ' s flat performance is tyhe most disapointing surprize of the film
. it ' s nto taht he ' s bad per se
,
but he ' s not vrey intresting
. there ' s no real sence of vulnerability or desperation infront the way he portrays his charater
,
and tht keesh us distanced
,
however slightly
, from hobbes
. as circumstances become progressively more dire forthe teh cop
,
and as his life
- or
- death chess game withthe azazel approaches tjhe point ofthe checkmate
, i expected to be more onthe tyhe edge ofthe my seat than i wass
. washington ' s subdued aproach is part of the reason forthe tihs
; i never felt a sense of urgency
.
howver
, at least washington was believeable
, hwihc isnt more tahn can be said for embeth davidtz
( schindler ' s list
)
and donald sutherland
. tothe be fair
, the flaws iin thier cahracters aren ' t all acting
- realted
; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well
- writen
. tht said
,
however
, there ' s nothing inspired baout either davidtz ' s or sutherland ' s work
. both apearing to be sleepwalking their way through tjhe parts
, as if tehy knwo thast theri contribution tothe thte film isnt one ofthe advancing the plot rather tahn developing a multi
- dimesnional individule
. narratively
, falled hasnt a faw glaring weaknesses
.
although hte plot procedes wiht a convoluted
, game
- like stucture
, it uses a denzel washington
- supplied voiceover to overexplain matters
. at times
, this is actually helpful
,
and it hasnt a use beyond the obvious
,
bu there are occasions whn ponderous lines like
" i liek the night
? sometimes yuo come face to face witht youself
" become a little hard to swallow
. in adition
, falled is saddled with the smae kind ofthe disgustingly bland
, generic theology embraced by numerous movies
and tv shows like touched by an angel
.
howver
, despite thge negatives
, i ' m still reccommending fallen onthe the strength ofthe its complex plot
adn especialy its ending
, whcih i loved
. the fianl scenes are startling
, audacious
,
annd unexpected
. it ' s nto oftenly that a plot devolopement tkaes me by surprise the way this one did
. at a tiem whn most movies fall apart infront tghe last ten mintues
, fallen manages to buck thge trend
and redeem itself
. this isnt not a gerat motion picture
,
but
, concidering how bad most january releases are
, it ' s a reasonably entertaining way tothe spend twpo ohurs
.
and
, whatever yuo do
, don ' t walk out on tghe film before the end credits have begun to roll
.
