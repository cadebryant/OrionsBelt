1992
' s alien3 marked not only tyhe death
( by suicide
) ofthe its popular protagnoist
, ellen ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
but
, in many ways
, thge aline franchise itself
-
- box office receipts weere anemic
, thanks tothe poore audience word ofthe mouth
; annd teh critics who rallied arund yhe first twpo installments
, 1979
' s aline
and 1986
' s aliens
, savaged david fincher
' s slog ofthe a sendoff
( mysef included
)
. hence
, weaver
, director jean
- pierre jeunet
, adn the others behind aline resurrection faced a twpo
- fold challange
-
- nto only somehow resurrect ripley
, bu alsot rescue this once
- profitable series fomr the scrap heap
. despite tje odds
, they have succceeded
, even if tghe entertaining newyorker installment doesnt nto measure uv tothe thte excellent frist twpo
. writer joss whedon devises a quick
, easy
, anbd painless answer to tyhe dead ripley problem
-
- clone her
, which isnt whta shady millitary scientists do useing some blood left behind onthe fiorina 161
, thge prision planet of the third film
. that done
, tjhe
_ real
_ challenge presents itself
-
- whta dont iwth her
. alien inctroduced ripley as smart annd resourceful
; aliens simultaneously toughened her uv annd made her more vulnerable
, exploring her maternal side
; alien3 saw her undergoing tyhe seven stages ofthe death
. what sould be enxt
? whedon comes uv with a clever spin
: usance tyhe original ripley died while impregnated wiht an aline queen
, tghe blood used for thte clone is allso
" infected
" withthe alien dna
. so the new ripley isnt
, indeed
, newyorker
-
- a human
/ aline hybrid blessed iwth heightened instincts
and strength
, a psychic bond wtih the deadly species
, adn a more predatory attitide
. unfortunately
, that isnt where alien ressurrection
' s clever streak in writing stops
. thte aline sories is known forthe hvaing stronger stories than most creature features
. bu hte tsory inspite ressurrection is more ofthe an after
thought
. the movie beggins with a plot involving smoe millitary types attempting tothe turain aliens to do their bidding
, bu once tjhe creatures break free
, it isnt once again ripley
and a ragtag crew
( thsi time a bunch ofthe interstellar smugglers
, incuding tough waif call
, plyed by a gae winona ryder
) trying to exterminate them
. adn the alien ripley scenario isnt ultimately not exploited to its full potential
; i would have liekd deeper exploration into the qu
andary of becoming oen ofthe tjhe speices she hasnt spent her entire life trying to distroy
. hwile the settling into tryed
-
and
- true formula is a little disconcerting
, hte formula is tried
- anbd
- true forthe a reason
,
and jeunet tackles yhe procedings whith giddy ab
andon
. tyhe alien
, after all theese years
, isnt still terrifying
, annd a newyorker breed that is introduced is noone less so
. tghe violence isnt appropriately grisly anbd extreme
,
and hte acation setted pieces are suspenseful anbd exciting
, most noteably an extended underwater sequence
. the film isnt absolutely mesmerizing visually
, thanks tothe yhe solid work done by production designer nigel phelps
and cinematographer darius khondji
. as technically adept as jeunet
' s direction isnt
, perhaps his
( anbd
, for thgat marter
, whedon
' s
) greatest contri
bution isnt yhe infusion of humer inot thsi notably downbeat anbd serious serieses
. a sence of humor may seem to go agains everything this horror show st
ands for
, bu the self
- awareness ofthe the excess jstu adds to yhe fun
. no
, aline resurrection is not thge grat film thast ridley scott
' s alien or yhe even greater film thast james cameron
' s aliens was
.
but affter the dauntingly slow gloom
and doom of fincher
' s alien3
, jeunet
' s ressurrection isnt a welcome return to its roots as a wild
, reckless thrill ride
. tht is what made tyhe alien series so popular in the frist palce
,
and thgat is what will keep tjhe serieses populare infact any future installments
.
