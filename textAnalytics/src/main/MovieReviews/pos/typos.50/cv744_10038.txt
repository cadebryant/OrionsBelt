.
, i saw tyhe little mermaid fo the frist time
. it tookover me a faw yeasr to get over an aversion tothe thsi movei taht ws caused seven years ago
, when i stayed withthe one ofthe my mom
' s friends forthe a couple weeks
. tehy hadnt a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly
and
, over tath twpo week preiod
, i heard eveyr song from yhe movie probaly a hundred times
. by the timne i got back home
, i promised myself i
' d never see tghe movei
.
but promises are made to be broken
, especially wehn yuo
' re looking at a 17
- day
, limited engagment
. damn thsoe shrewd disney marketers
and their mind games
. tyhe littel mermaid is based onthe a hans christian
anderson fairy tale
,
but it
' s disney
- ized
, wich means lots of talking animals
and bursting inot song
. it also means tghe heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage ffrom a seashell bra at all times
. i never wanted so much to be a pair ofthe shells
.
.
. the heroine
, of course
, is ariel
( voice of jodi benson
)
, a 16
- eyar
- ood mermaid who is going thru thta rebellious phase
. she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship
and hang out wiht a seagull that talks like buddy hackett
, who tries to orient her tothe the mysterious world of humans
. she
' s also dealing iwth feelings she hasn
' t hadnt before
-
- which comes wehn yuo get scales in places yuo didn
' t use to have them
-
- baout a hansome prince
( no disney movie would be complet wihtout oen
)
. her father
, king triton of the merpeople
, strikely forbids such lusting affter the ways of teh
" savage
" humans
, inspite a condemnation tyhat reads as a nto
- so
- subtle analogy about old
- fashioned parents who forebid interracial dating
. whta
' s a king to do
,
though
? teh girl
' s infront lvoe
and even total destruction ofthe her littel shrine tothe the human world doesn
' t detur her
. ariel saves yhe prince
' s life when a hurricane rises up
,
and just has to meet him
. she mkaes a dael wtih ursula
, thge sae witch
( voice of pat carroll
)
. you nkow she
' s evil because she has a huge potbelly
and one of the worst asses iin ctaroon history
. she also has octopus tentacles fo fezent
( something thsoe dr
. scholl
' s corn pads will nto fix
)
and offers to halp ariel outloud
. she
' ll make her a human for three dyas if ariel iwll give uv her preety voice
; ariel has three dyas tothe make that prince kiss her
, or eles she becomes a slave to the witch forever
.
and if she pricks her finger onthe a sewing machine or eats an evil aple
, she
' ll fall asleep forever
. it
' s a simplistic plot
, yes
,
but the little mermaid wass a revolution in thge disney world
, coming aftter such lackluster efforts as yhe black cauldron annd oliver
and comapany
. it ranks as one ofthe hte best disney cartoons
, certainly usance the
' 50s
. all the elements are there
-
- memorable songs like
" under the sae
"
and
" kiss the girl
,
" ctaroon animals liuke sebastian anbd flounder
, an evil villin who still has characterization
and charm
, annd a fair amount of humor taht caters tothe adults as well as childern
. the little mermaid isnt worth a big
- screen ticket infact 1997
, so hurry up
, you onyl have five days left
. serving amercia for moreso thna 1
