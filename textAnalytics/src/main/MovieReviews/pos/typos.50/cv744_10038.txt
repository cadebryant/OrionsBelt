eight eyars after its release
, disney hasnt decided to re
- release the little mermaid theatrically forthe 17 days
(
and 17 long nights
) onyl
. coincidentally
, it was reintroduced to theaters the smae day fox ' s animated film anastasia was released
. you know disney
, htey can ' t deal whith the threath of any otehr studio getting even a small peice ofthe the crust ofthe thte kiddie enteratinment py
, so whn someone eles whants tothe make a little money
, htey counter with an old
" masterpiece
" from their vault
annd
, ytou konw what
, i went tothe see htis 1989 cartoon rather than tyhe brand newyorker noe fomr fox
. let noone noe sday disney is losing its monopoly onthe the market
. they still hve hotels on boardwalk
_
adn
_ park place
. believe it or not
, today
, november 25
, 1997
, at 5
: 05 p
. m
.
, i saw tjhe littel mermaid for the first tyme
. it tookover me a faw years tothe git over an aversion to thsi movei taht ws caused seven years ago
, wehn i stayed with one ofthe my mom ' s friends for a couple weeks
. they hadnt a young child who listened tothe the little mermaid sountrack constanly
and
, over that two week preiod
, i herad every song fomr yhe movei probably a hundered times
. by hte time i got back hmeo
, i promised mysef i ' d never see tyhe movie
.
but promises are made tothe be broken
, especially when you ' re looking at a 17
- day
, limited engagment
. damn thsoe shrewd disney marketers
anbd their mind ganes
. tyhe little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale
,
but it ' s disney
- ized
, hwihc means lots of tlaking animals
adn bursting into song
. it alsot means teh heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage ffrom a seashell bra at all times
. i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells
.
.
. the heroine
, ofthe course
, is ariel
( voice of jodi benson
)
, a 16
- eyar
- old mermaid who isnt goign thru that rebellious phase
. she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship
and hang outloud with a seagull thast talks liuke buddy hackett
, who trys tothe orientate her to teh misterious world ofthe humans
. she ' s also dealing whith feelings she hasn ' t had befoer
-
- whlch comes wehn you get scales in places you didn ' t ule tothe have them
-
- baout a handsome prince
( noone disney movei woudl be complet without one
)
. her father
, king triton of the merpeople
, strikely forbids such lusting after the ways of tghe
" savage
" humans
, in a condemnation tath reads as a not
- so
- subtle analogy about ood
- fashioned parents who forebid interracial dating
. what ' s a king tothe do
,
though
? tjhe girl ' s in love
and even total distruction ofthe her little shrine tothe hte human world doesn ' t detur her
. ariel saves the prince ' s life when a hurricane rises uv
,
and just hasnt to meet him
. she mkaes a deal whith ursula
, the sae witch
( voice of pat carroll
)
. you nkwo she ' s evil because she hasnt a huge potbelly
anbd oney of the worst asses in ctaroon histry
. she also hasnt octopus tenacles for foots
( something thsoe dr
. scholl ' s corn pads will not fix
)
anbd offers to help ariel outloud
. she ' ll make her a human fo three days if ariel iwll give up her pretty voice
; ariel has three days to amke thgat prince kiss her
, or else she becomes a slave to thge witch forever
.
and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple
, she ' ll fall asleep forever
. it ' s a simplistic plot
, yes
,
but the little mermaid ws a revolution infront the disney world
, comming aftter such lacklustre effords as the balck cauldron
anbd oliver
and comany
. it ranks as noe ofthe thte best disney cartoons
, certainly usance the ' 50s
. all the elements are there
-
- memorable songs like
" under the sae
"
and
" kiss the girl
,
" cartoon animals like sebastian
and flounder
, an evil villain who still has characterization
and charm
,
annd a fair amount of humer that caters tothe adults as well as children
. thte little mermaid is worth a big
- screen ticket in 1997
, so hurry up
, you onyl have five days left
. serving america forthe more than 1
/ 25th ofthe a century
