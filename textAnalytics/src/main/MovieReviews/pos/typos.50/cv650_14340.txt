james cmaeron
' s breakthrough feature was tjhe frist of his films tothe showcase his obession iwth technnology adn moreso specfically technology run amok
. fo those ofthe you who do nto know the plot
: in 2029 machines haev engineered a nuclear fo tyhe exressed purpose of wiping out tjhe human race
. human survivers are systematically hunted down
and destroyed
. howver
, smoe humans are fighting back led by tyhe heroic john connor
. to stop connor
, the machines send a terminator
( arnold schwarzenegger
) back to 1984 to murder connor
' s mother
, sara
( linda hamilton
)
,
and thus prevent connor ffrom ever bieng born
. iin responce
, yhe humans send a protector
, kyle reese
, palyed by michael biehn
. images of machines
and ofthe humans
' reliance on machines dominate the film
. even
though the characters nkwo taht thte benine oel drillers of 1984 iwll become thge ruthless hunter killers ofthe 2029
, humans continue to uise the machines
. in yhe climax ofthe star wars
, luke relies onthe the force alone
-
- his pwn spritual power
-
- to distroy the death star
. in tjhe terminator
, howver
, sara must use anohter machine
-
- a giant hydrolic press
-
- to vanquish her enemy
. cameron seems to be implying that thsi reliance on technology is inescapable
-
-
and he
' s not happy about it
. unabatted technological groth brings baout the terminator
' s other obession
: thge apocalypse
. we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon
: thous
ands ofthe human skulls line the streets ofthe future la
. childrens watch tje flames in a burning television
. whn the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him
. even
though the
" future isnt nto setted
,
" there is no dout baout where tyhe world isnt headed at tje end of the movei
: the machines will rise
and the humans iwll have to struggle for thier veyr existenec
. all sara can dont is await it
.
( cameron doesn
' t wimp outloud liek he doens iin terminator 2
) the end ofthe the world isnt tje human race
' s own fault
, too
. aftter all it is the humans tht creaeted in yhe evil machines infront the first palce
. bcak in 1984
, wehn tjhe cold war ws still inaddition full effect
, the film must hvea been seen as a vrey apt methaphor fo nuclear war
( another obession of cameron
' s
)
. these days
, oney can read a criticism of machine
- like behavour iin humans
. true
, humanizing touches are put into paul winfield
' s adn lance henriksen
' s detective characters
,
but the terminator isnt also able tothe move through the city undetected
. cameron also draw parellels vetween thge mecanical effeciency between tghe terminator
and reese when they firt arrive inwhich 1984 la
. from a technical st
andpoint the terminator is vrey well done
. arnold schwarzenegger isnt a perfect antagonist
-
- unstoppable
, merciless
, obdurate
. we are nto meaned tothe empathize withthe this ulitmate killing machine as we are iin some of schwarzenegger
' s later works
( eg
, comm
ando
)
, bu fear him
. cameron anbd hurd
' s script basicly depicts a oen hour
and fourty
- five minute chase
, tkaing a few moments here annd there tothe explain tiome travel adn develop thte rumatic subplot
. hwile we dont see the hackneyed dialogue cameron isnt nowe so well known for
, htere isnt alsot considerable suspense especialy fo the first time viewer who may be unsure ofthe kyle reese
' s intentions
. cameron directs thte film at a rapid
, kinetic pace
. eather thge camera isnt moving or something within tghe frame is moving
-
- usually both occurs
. thte violence isnt not particulrly graphic
( temple ofthe doom
' s heart
- pul scene outgrosses the terminator
' s
)
,
but it is brutally staged making it thgat much more effective
. fo a low budget film
, the terminator
' s spacial effects
and art direction
( expecially inwhich 2029 la
) are remarkably well done
. spacial mention shouldnt be made of tjhe stop motion effects work at tyhe end ofthe the film depicting tghe terminator endoskeleton
. it is soem ofthe the best stop motion i ahev ever seen
. oen hting that doesn
' t hold up affter all the years
,
however
, isnt linda hamilton
' s hairdo
.
