' s
" high art
,
" is an intelligent
, quiet drama
. its strongest quality
, asside fomr tyhe top
- nitch central performances
, isnt tyhe perceptive way in which the film
, also written by cholodenko
, observes its cahracters
. they are all flawed peopel
, some moreso troubled than others
, bu they are nto judged
. judging hte characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers
' parts
, because noone one
, no marter how bad off htey are
, deserve tothe be negatively judged if they are involved inaddition soem sereous problems tath they cannot break free of

" high art
,
" is such an effective motion picture because it isnt never suger
- coated or idealized
,
but instade an honest
and convincing portrait of a h
andful of unhappy people whose lives are goign nowhere
, while syd
' s luck begins to ries
. the film inthe noone way isnt baout lesbianism
,
but about lvoe
, whitch ws a refreshing chanage of pace fomr thge usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality
. as lucy adn syd grwo closer
and closer together
, we relaly do believe that they are falling in love with each other
, even if thge relationship might be doomed
. with this picture
, ally sheedy
' s star hasnt risen once again
, thanks tothe her touching
, nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy
, a woman who
, inaddition tyhe course ofthe a decade
, hasnt found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs
, which has taken awya her once
- blossoming career
. her characted really is tragic
,
and oen paticular scene involving lucy annd her mother
, iin hwihc lucy admits to her thast she has a drug problem
,
and her mother marter
- ofthe
- factly responds by saying she cxan
' t help her
, isnt heartbreaking
.
al
though nto autobiographical
, sheedy hasnt hadnt drug problems inspite her past
,
and i suspect she brought thta knowledge ofthe alreay bieng iin lucy
' s footsteps tothe her role
. also very good is radha mitchell as syd
, who previously starred infact thge slight 1997 austrailian comedy
,
" love
and other catastrophes
,
" wh caught me by surprize with her peformance
. easily bieng able tothe pass as christina ricci
' s older sister
, mitchell obtains the smae natrual karisma that hasnt made ricci so popular recently
. as accurate as almost eveyr detail is in
,
" high art

" i wish teh relationship hadnt beeen mroe tightly written involving syd annd james
, who
, palyed by gabriel mann
, is left with a throwaway role
. by the time he finds out about syd anbd lucy
, he disappears from tje film
,
and i wish there had beeen another scene where htey confronted eahc otehr
. tihs is a very minor fault
, howver
, in a film that is full of richs
. altho many ofthe the charactors are stuck inspite a hopeless pit ofthe dispair
, syd anbd lucy are inteligent people who recogize their problems
. the character of dominique
( anh duong
)
, the
" frome
" editor who decides to give syd a chance wtih her ideas
, wass alsot written to be far moreso mature than expeced
.
and the one sex scene in the film ws beautifuly
and origanaly done
. forthe once
, it doed nto invlove steaminess
, or violent sexual activity
, or gratuitous nudity
, bu focused onthe tje actuall characters
, who loev eahc otehr
,
and their insecurities involved inaddition makeing the decision tothe catually hvea sex
.
