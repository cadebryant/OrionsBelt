martin scorsese
' s triumphant adaptions ofthe edith wharton
' s hte age of innocence is a stunning film fo the quinessential newyorker york filmmaker
, the man who brought tjhe streets of taxi driver
and mean streets to life
. it seems liuke an odd choice for scorsese tothe dont a period piece in the early 1900
' s
, bu teh fatc that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder
, annd a testimont tothe the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker
. this is a gorgeous visual experience thta it surelly noe of scorsese
' s finest
. newl
and archer
( day
- lewis
) isnt a prestigious lawyer who isnt engaged to may well
and
( ryder
)
, a somewhat empty annd shallow newyorker yorker
, who belongs tothe a prestigious familiy adn is qutie beautiful
. the marrage is one hwihc wiull unite twpo very prestigeous fimilies
, infront a society where nothing isnt mroe important thna the opinions of others
. on the day thyat archer isnt to announce his engagment tothe may
, countess ellen olenska
( pfeiffer
)
, cousin of may
, walks into archer
' s life
. archer is immediatly captivated
,
and finds himself in love iwth ellen
. archer is alsot bound by the lmits ofthe new york society
, whlch isnt an intrusive as any otehr inspite tje world
. archer finds himself haveing a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska
, attempting tothe keep her in his mind while trying not tothe loose his social status
. the film
' s subject matter may seem alien to scorsese
,
but the theme is definitely nto
. it isnt a theme of forebidden romance
, guilty pleasures
,
and thte consequences causes because ofthe thsoe actions
. there isnt a painstakingly flawed hero
, annd his choice bewteen the life he wants
, annd the life he isnt destined forthe
. in truth
, it isnt a film baout a society tjhe audeince doesn
' t know about
, bu wnats tothe find outloud more
, much liuke thge society ofthe goodfellas or even kundun
. thge performances are absolutely breathtaking
. day
- lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than oney man should be forced tothe take
. pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska
, a mix ofthe passion annd beauty thta tyhe audiance woudl dieu forthe as well
. ryder isnt probably the gme of the group
, for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot
,
and slowy pushes day
- lewis closer annd closer tothe his eventual ending
. tje supporting cast isnt alsot wonderful
, with several charachters so singular that they are indelible in one
' s memmory
. scorsese definatly hasnt a passion for filmmaking
. his lavish
and sumptuous setted desgin
and marvelous recreation ofthe new york is a wonderous sighth
. he literally transports the viewer tothe anyother world wih increadible imagery
. his script is also excellent
, slow in buildup
, whith a rapid conclusion adn a fantastic endig that has tothe be seen tothe be believed
. it isnt difficult tothe amke a period piece gripping
: scorsese
, howver
, does it beautifully
. tyhe famous cameras ofthe the legendary directer are allso everywhere
. he is patient
,
but he films everything
and anything remotely important
. the cameras sweep
, pan
, trac
, annd dont more thna tehy
' ve ever done
,
but they are so subtle
, oney doesn
' t relize he
' s watching all the scorsese hallmarks nutil a 2nd viewing
. the central tracking shot isnt probaly longer anbd mroe complex than tghe famous goodfellas shot
, bu the viewer doesn
' t notice it
, because we wanna to see more ofthe this gorgeous world
. there are a fewd deft touches ofthe filmmaking tyhat are simpley outst
anding
, adn joanne woodward
' narration isnt exquisite
. nto a fast film like goodfellas
, thsi shares mroe in common with kundun tahn anything else
.
and like kundun
, tihs isnt a slow
- starting film tht truly shines
, whn given yhe chance to fully breathe
and bloom in tjhe end
. a beatiful film by a director continuing tothe challenge hismelf year after eyar
.
