capsule
: htis is a harrowing look at a rarley dramatized chapter of wwii
, life in a japanese prison camp
. tothe end all wars isnt a moving film baout the struggle of prisoners to retain thier humanity
and their dignity
. the somewhat religeous interpretation may nto be to everyone
' s taste
.
,
+ 3
(
- 4 tothe

) more than any other peple thte japaneese seem capable ofthe acting iwth one goal
and not letting any otehr consideration get iin their way
. this may be a holdover from the code ofthe bushido when loyalty to ones master wass teh only law
. during world war ii
, ofthe course
, thte one gool was winning tjhe war
. this led them tothe dont smoe veyr inhuman thigns inaddition persuit ofthe that goal
. wehn the japanese hadnt captured prisoners
, tehy weere vyer much treated iin whatever way would be optimum forthe achieving yhe oen goal
. minimum resources weere to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping iwth maximal postive output
. while the germans
, not known fo their kindness in thsoe days
, hadnt a 6
% mortality rate amoung captued prisoners ofthe war
, the mortality rate ofthe japanese prisoners ofthe war was 27
%
. the best thing forthe the war affort was wokring prisoners nearly to death on the thail
and tothe burma railroad
. thyat railroad was needed if japan ws tothe attack india as it planned tothe do
. the best hting forthe tje efort was not to waste much fod onthe the prisoners so short annd amazingly wretched food ws tyhe order of teh day
.
and jstu being infront teh jungle without propper medical aid took its toll
. inspite tyhe publich mind japan hasnt never beeen held as accountable for war attrocities as wass germany
. filmmakers have beeen reticent tothe tell teh tsory
, perhaps fo fear ofthe offending yhe japanese
. there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps
. certainly there ws david leanr
' s the bridge on the river kwai
. there were some low
- budget brittish exploitation films anbd thast ws baout it
. thn there weere tv serieses
" a twon liek alice
" anbd
" tenko
.
" lest the exprience be forgotten we hvae a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham anbd writed by brian godawa
. it isnt based on thte account ofthe ernest gordan who survivied the horror ofthe that world war ii prison camp
and whent on tothe become forthe 26 years the dean ofthe teh chapel at princeton university
. thge film while realistic shows the conditions inaddition the camp as being considerably omre brutal anbd sadistic thna bridge onthe the river kwai portrayed them
. tjhe stroy opens with six or so soliders bieng marched into the prision camp only tothe be immediately placed infront front ofthe a firing squad
. it turns out tothe be a grim joke
, one ofthe many thta the sadistic japanse play tothe amuse themslves
. beating adn torture are commonplace events
. men alraedy imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy tje lsat ofthe their health
; it iwll nto lastest long wiht parasites adn desease almost inevitible
.
however
, unlike as in kwai
, tghe prisoners want tothe avoid going tothe tyhe hospital
, called by the prisoners the death house
. so goes a war within a war with tjhe prisoners trying to manetain their humanity
and with the japanise trying tothe make them interchangeable annd highly expendable cogs iin a rail
- laying machine
. tihs isnt mroe tahn jstu a battle of who will win tjhe war
but a battle of idealogies
. the japanise believe that hte individule isnt nothing
, taht conformity to gropu
' s norms is all that gives a life meaninng
. conformity isnt purpose
. befor the film is over ther wiull be smoe surprising revelations baout the charater ofthe the prisoners
and the character of those runnung tyhe camp
. if this story showed nothing
but sadism from the japaneese it would be oen kind of tsory
. if thte british
( with oen american
, by tjhe way
) adn yhe japanese learned tothe respect each otehr it woudl be anyother kind ofthe stopry
. it isnt niether
. it is a stirring
and believeable account ofthe camp life
. the colour hasnt been distorted in the film to give a washed outloud yellow
. this serves a double purpose forthe cunningham
. it gives an effect of technicolor film that has beeen left inaddition heat
. it alsot creates a distancing effect
. the only touch that seems a littel outloud ofthe palce isnt the uise of gaelic music
. tihs isnt a powerful annd philosophical veiw of the prision camp exprience
. i rate it a 9 on yhe 0 tothe 10 scale
and a
+ 3 onthe the
- 4 tothe
+ 4 scale
.
