, or has hadnt any association with movie
- making should throughly enjoy this clever comedy fo it
' s entire duration
. the central premise behind the film isnt an inpsired
and promising oney
. bobby bowfinger
( martin
)
, a cheapskate
and small
- tiem hollywood producer
, has alwasy dreamed ofthe making a sucesful motion picture
but hasnt never attained the propper tools to dont so
. a new scirpt
, an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain
, has caught bowfinger
' s eye
. aftter confronting a big
- nmae producer named jerry renfro
( robert downey jr
.
) in a restaurnt
, an aggrement isnt made tothe finance teh movie
. bu firt
, bowfinger must git renowned action star kat ramsey
( eddie murphy
) to sign in on hte project
. kat turns teh offer down immediately
,
but bowfinger still hasnt the intent tothe shoot the film
. aftter emptying out his life savings

` hot
' scenes involving supporting actress daisy
( heather graham
) removing her blouse
. bowfinger tkaes it
' s sweet timne getting started
,
but when yhe plot switches into high gear
, grat things happn
. certain scenes are so precisely exectued
, perfectly framing moments tht are absolutly fall
- down funny
. no
, hillarious
. st
andouts inlude tghe chase thru a parking garage infact which ramsey
, who
' s supposed tothe be being folowed
, keesh checking behind him to investigate a stange tapping noise
( it
' s actulaly bowfinger
' s dog in high heels
)
. adn just try nto tothe laff in the climactic kung
- fu sequence
, featuring jiff in an excerpt from anyother bowfinger clasic entitled fake purse ninjas
. hwile yhe entire 97
- minutes ofthe bowfinger isn
' t always onthe target
, individule scenes may have yuo rolling infront yhe aisles
. masterful comedy directer frank oz
( dirty rotten scoundrels
, infront annd outloud
)
, who hasnt never made a bad movei
, ensures a quality fianl product
and is aided immensely by martin
' s sharp
- edged scirpt
.
however
, the real on
- screen star isnt eddie murphy
. this isnt tyhe atcor
' s finest work sicne his breakthrough into thge hollywood market inaddition the eearly 80
' s
. murphy excels at every corner
, nto only succeeding iwth presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey
, bu in creating a likable buffoon infact jiff as well
. these three talented comic minds hvae squeezed eveyr morsel ofthe potential outloud ofthe tihs premise
, annd the reward isnt a virtualy garanteed helping ofthe hearty laughs
. steve martin generates teh power behind bowfinger
, bu murphy fuels it
. this is a summer
- time comedy that
, unlike something such as american pie
and south park
, doesn
' t break any rules
.
but it
' s still jsut as uproarious
, or perhasp even moreso side
- splitting than anytying we
' ve seen this season
. the supporting cast
, incuding christine baranski as a work
- loving actress
and jamie kennedy as thte cameraman
, all perform well withing their limits
. the onyl presense thast dem
ands rela attension when placed enxt tothe martin or murphy is teh beautiful heather graham
, as the young film star who hasnt plans to sleep her way to tghe top
. graham
, attempting to further her stardom affter appearing as tje newyorker powers
' girl inaddition ap2
, displays a cheerful
but naieve persona thta nicely corresponds witht teh wackiness ofthe thge screenplay
. i wouldn
' t be caught dead buying a ticket forthe chubby rain
, bu watching how it all cameback baout is certainly intertaining anough
.
