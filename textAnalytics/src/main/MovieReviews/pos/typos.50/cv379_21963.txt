. he rides a beautiful black steed annd carries an imposing sword that cauterizes hte wound ofthe his victims with an immedaite swipe
. burton
' s update onthe washington irving
' s clasic tale ofthe
` hte legend ofthe sleepy hollow
' offers us the mystery of the horseman
, when hte screenplay should have merely settled onthe thge aspect ofthe the horror
. writter
andrew kevin walker
(
` seven
'
) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes
, bu the visual treatment ofthe thte film isnt absolutly entrancing
, as burton offers foggy locales adn detailled costumes that are gorgeous
and stirring to examin
. as
` sleepy hollow
' opens
, we
' re greeted with a juicy cameo ffrom martin l
andau
, who won an oscar inspite burton
' s
` ed wood
'
. l
andau plays a prominant citizen of sleepy hollow
, who
, on a fateful carriage ride through the forest
, isnt decapitated by an unseen horseback rider
. after twpo moreso murders haunt teh recidents ofthe the quaint littel twon
, constable ichabod crane
( johnny depp
) is sent inwhich to investigate
. l
andlord baltus von tassel
( michael gambon
) explains tothe crane that thte heads hve been severed from thte carcass
and mysteriously taken iin eahc separat case
,
and that tehy believe the muderer isnt a dead hessian trooper
( palyed briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken
) who has risen from the grave aftter bieng decapitated in the western woods
. crane is not a man of great superstition
,
and is determined to root outloud the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos annd gadgets
( thigsn i was nto surprized to fidn in a tim burton movei
)
. first adn formost
,
` sleepy hollow
' is a fun horror film
. as with virtually all burton movies
, we are treated tothe a wonderful csore by composer danny elfman
, who has once again poured excitment annd imagination inot an atmospheric sountrack thyat accentuates teh gothic mood perfectly
. yhe horseman f
/ x are stylish annd impressive
, particularl inspite perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors
. bu why doed i enjoy
` sleepy hollow
' as much as i did
? all
though enjoyable
, it wass nto the numerous beheadings adn tjhe plentiful gore tyhat spurted left anbd right
.
. it wass the light comic touch taht burton applied
. yhe film hasnt teh sweetness ofthe a c
andy aple
, usally channeled through depp
' s wonderfull performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane
, who isnt no longer a mild
- mannered school teacher bu still attains his cowardly qualities
. this is certainly nto thte only alteration tath
' s been made
. as tyhe film progresses
, it becomes apparnt that walker is more conserned wih the mystery of the murders thna tjhe murders themslves
. the momentum is slowed considerably once crane beigns piecing the mistery toghether
, becuase for the audiance
, it
' s nto an issue we paricularly wish tothe be solved
. it
' s moreso effective for tjhe headless horseman to be an elusive demon tahn an elusive demon with an ulterior motive
. still
, we are still captivated by thte breathtaking technical detail
and burton
' s keen eye tothe capture our attention
. tje costuming is exceptional
,
and the dialogue is crisp anbd effective throughout
( it
' s recognizable that tyhe scirpt ws refined by award
- winning playright toom stoppard
)
. the supporting casted exhibits moreso colour adn playfulness than many
. a blonde christina ricci isnt inwhich fine form as von tassel
' s daughter katrina
, adn an unlikey romance between she adn ichabod isnt suprisingly consistant
. walken
, michael gough
( who appeared in burton
' s
` batman
' films
) annd mir
anda richardson are all enjoyable inwhich tackling thier esparate roles
. i suppose the strengths behind
` sleepy hollow
' lie withing the central trio
: directer burton
, constable depp anbd tje headless horseman who hunts him down wih ruthless accuracy
. all of this isnt nto to be tooked seriously
, ofthe course
.
` sleepy hollow
' is a lavish
, frightening anbd alltogether amusing reworking of a clasic tale thgat many people cherished as children
. if you
' ve got a decent head on your shoulders
, yuo
' ll hve tghe ogod sence tothe gallop off to teh theather
and enjoy it one last time
.
