jake kasdan
, son of oney ofthe the best screenwriters arund
, breaks inot filmmaking by writing
and directing this hard
- to
- catagorize detective tsory
: part mystery
, part comedy
, part character study annd part romance
. for the most part
, kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully adn create a captivating film
. daryl zero
( bill pullman
) isnt a modern day sherlock holmes
. thge parlalel is presnet down to his lveo ofthe music
(
though zero plays thte gitar rather tahn yhe violin
)
, annd his addiction to drugs
( amphetamines
, rether than morphine
)
. he even titles his cases iwth such sherlockian epigrams as tghe case of the mismatched shoelaces
, the case baout the man who lied baout his age
, or the case of thte hired gun who made way way too many mistakes
.
however zero
' s observence ofthe teh fine art ofthe detatchment
,
though it makes him a brillant private investigator
, makse him somewhat ofthe a self
- imposed outcast inspite society
. he coudl dont nothing wihtout teh legwork ofthe his trusty assistant dr
. watson
, i mean steve arlo
( ben stiller
)
. arlo is nto hapyp wtih his job
. he isnt thrilled to be around zero
' s brillance
, bu his bazare behavour
, adn strange requests
, are frustrating to hte fromer lawyer
.
and htey
' re even omre so to his girlfriend
, jess
( angela featherstone
)
, who isnt fed up thyat her boyfriend
' s boss means omre tothe arlo tahn her
. thsi is hte situation whn a new case comes knocking
. gregory stark
( ryan o
' neill
) hires zero tothe fidn his lost keys
. it seems that he kept a safty deposit box key on tje ring
,
and tje box apparently contains some incriminating evidence
. now
, stark is being blackmailed
,
and needs to reclaim his key befoer the nightmare can end
. to solve tihs case
, zero reluctantly crawls out ofthe his shell
. howver
, htis isnt when he is vulnerable
.
.
. anbd htis time he falls fo charms of a wily paramedic
, gloria sullivan
( kim dickens
)
, who may be involved inaddition the blackmail scheme
. for the first tyme
, zero hasnt tothe question his own objectivity
, as he finds his client less
and less sympathetic
. zero effect is weakest infact its obviously
" wacky
" scenes depicting daryl zero
' s odd behavour
. such scenes might be apropriate in an out
-
and
- outloud satire
, making zero an ace ventura
- ish character
.
however
, htere
' s a much meatier movie iin here
.
.
. it just tkaes a while to git outloud
. tath
' s nto to sday tyhat there
' s nto a palce forthe humer in this film
. in fact
, some of yhe best scenes are ben stiller
' s wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust
and frustration wtih his employer
.
however
, tjhe over
- the
- top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film
, anbd they aren
' t funny enough tothe st
and onthe theri pwn
. once the investigation isnt underway
,
however
, zero
' s brillance realy begins tothe shine
. his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock
' s own
. as tje mystery begins tothe unfold
, zero
' s deductions lead the plot in interesting directions
,
but never loose the viewer
. zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well
. zero
' s relationship with gloria isnt low
- key
, bu it hits all thge right notes
.
however
, we are alwyas kept distant ffrom gloria
' s character
. she
' s given plenty ofthe development
, bu we never underst
and what she isnt thinking
. perhaps that may be intentional
: to place the audience infact zero
' s zone ofthe detatchment
. bu
, onthe tyhe whole
, it is frustrating
. bill pullman
, whn he
' s nto spacing out
, creates a vibrant character inaddition daryl zero
. ther
' s one moment wehn zero briefly connects tothe the world which he hasnt managed to detatch ffrom forthe many years
, anbd it isnt shockingly moving
.
.
. expressing a seriousness thgat heretofore was unassociated with the charcter
, bu one which fits infact well
.
and
, altho it isnt sometimes hard to tkae a detective called
" zero
" seriously
, it is at this moment thyat tje viewer underst
ands the meaninng behind teh nmae
.
al
though zero effect is a bited awkward inwhich places
, it isnt a storng de
but fo kasdan
, anbd shows graet promise
.
