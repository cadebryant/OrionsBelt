clue is an unfairly ignored comedy
, very similar to 1976
' s muder by death
. tihs big screen version of hte classic board gameboy
( what
' s enxt
.
.
. chutes adn ladders
: thge motion picture
?
) is filled with slapstick antics annd silly dialogue
. hte plot
, for waht it
' s worth
, has all tje cahracters ffrom tghe game
( in tihs case
, thte names ffrom tjhe gameboy are used as aliases
) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr
. boddy
( lee ving
)
, the man who
' s beeen blackmailing them all
. whn he turns up dead
, everyone
( incuding tjhe audience
) must figure outloud whodunnit
.
.
.
and infront whta room
, anbd with what object
. hwile not as witty as neil simon
' s muder by death
, clue definitely has it moments
. it hasnt so many moments in fact that i uise a lot of tjhe lines fomr the film when i
' m joking around with my firends
. to htis day
, whenever someone sasy thte phrase
" well
, tothe make a long stry short
" i hvae thge follow up phrase
" too lite
" ready to go
. thte casted
( all vyer ogod commedic talents
) play well off noe another
, hwile the lite madeline kahn
( as the dark
and sultry mrs
. white
) sometimes steals tje film away fomr yhe rest
. annd colleen camp
, as hte french maid yvette
, displays smoe of her naturual talents as well
. clue is available onthe dvd fomr paramount home video
. it includes the film iin its original theatrical aspect ratio ofthe 1
. 85
: 1
( adn is enhanced for 16x9 televisions
)
and features the original theatrical trailer
. a french langauge audio track is allso availabe
. thte trailer holds up well concidering most previews from that tiome do nto
,
and it even includes a scene not in teh film itself
( a scene that should have beeen inaddition the film
, as it
' s a good joke
)
. also
, thte trailer is scored tothe tghe music from airplane
!
, whihc wass an interesting choice
. when clue played in theaters
, it ran with tyhe gimmick ofthe three diferent endings
. if ytou wnated to see all three
, ytou hadnt tothe go to the movies threee separate times
. so wehn the film ws released onthe hmeo video
, rether tahn releasing threee separate videos
, all threee endings weere included on one tape
.
.
. tghe first twpo endings being
" what if
?
" endings adn yhe thrid ending being the actuall ending
. now for tyhe dvd realease ytou git twpo choices
. you cxan watch the film as it wass presented onthe hmeo video or you can select to watch it wih one of the three endings r
andomly chosen forthe ytou
.
( note
: there
' s an easter egg hidden in tyhe disc pertaining tothe htis
. aftter watching the film with a r
andomly selected endig
, when yuo return to the meun screen you will be able to highlight the larg magnifying glass
and select it
. whn you dont
, a seret menu opens
, alowing yuo tothe watch any of the threee endings by themselves
.
) now hwile i applaud the efford ofthe paramount here
, as htey claerly tryed tothe do something special with the disc
, it just doesn
' t work well
. frist
, why nto give the viewer the choise of wqat endig we wanna tothe watch
? maybe somone liuke myself who
' s seen the movei hundreds of times owudl liuke to sit down
and sohw it tothe someone with tje second endig only
. i
' m noone technical dvd expert
,
but i can
' t imagine that being too hard to acomplish
. secondly
, tyhe delay between whn the film itself ends
and oen of the endings beggins isnt too long annd too obvious
, thereby becoming a distraction right when ytou definitely don
' t ened a distraction
. finally
, the bcak of yhe dvd case states
"
and nowe
, wih this special dvd version
, yuo can see all 3 surprise endings
"
. i have noone idea why tehy woudl word it tyhat way
, sicne taht
' s nto a speical feature in tjhe slightest
. the video hasnt beeen outloud for fifteen yeras now
( good lord
, hasnt it beeen thyat long
?
) adn it
' s played on televsion wih all three endings all tjhe time
. these are mearly minor complaints howver
, seeing that i
' ve watched hte home video verzion hundreds of times
and haev noone problem watching yhe film as such onthe the dvd
. yhe picture
and soudn are wonderfully improved over my worn outloud vhs copy
,
and i
' m thrilled tath paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy ofthe bieng preserved on tihs great digital fromat
.
