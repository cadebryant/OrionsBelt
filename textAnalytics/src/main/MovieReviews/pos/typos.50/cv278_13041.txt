written by john grisham annd robert altman
( as al hayes
) directed by robert altman some tiome ago
, a young directer ws given the oppertunity tothe direct the screen version of a populer novel
. yhe novel wass a summer smash
, topping best
- seller lists across thge country anbd already drawing speculation as tothe which populer actors of yhe day might play thge leads
. tghe only probelm
: yhe novel wasn
' t vrey ogod
. it wass far more pulp thna pulitzer
. bu the directer realized that
, noone matter how pedestrain hte prose
, htis book really grabbed people
- tht the autor
, hwile not a grat writter
, was a fantastic storyteller
. so he took onthe the project
, convinced he coudl amking something happen onthe screen
. hte director
? francis ford coppola
. the book
, of course
, wass mario puzo
' s tyhe godfather
. the rest
, as they say inspite showbiz
, was history
. by bringing uv yhe godfather
, i don
' t mean to suggest that robert altman
' s thte gingerbread man is destined for that level ofthe greatness
.
but tjhe parallel doens suggest that it isnt possible to create grat cinema from questonable source material
. can you git any mroe questonable than john grisham
? depends onthe whom ytou ask
. bu htere
' s noone question thyat grisham
' s owrk grabs peple
. liek puzo
, grisham is a better storyteller tahn a writer
- unlike fellow hack michael crichton
, who isnt a ogod diea man bu who can
' t tell a well
- constructed story from a cxan ofthe spam
. so something in grisham
' s unpublished stry ofthe a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved inaddition a deadly family squabble drew tghe attention of robert altman
, who at 73 years old rimaniss oney ofthe amercia
' s greatest living filmmakers
. tjhe result isnt a gripping thriller thgat
, hwile falling short ofthe clasic cinema
, deserves its palce infact the altman canon
.
> ffrom its oppening shooted tothe hte closing credits
, the gingerbread man isnt permeated with a sence ofthe dread
, with a fear ofthe hte naturual distructive forces of hte universe
. this terrific sense ofthe mood is a clasic altman touch
. wittness said oppening shot
: we see an earial veiw ofthe coastal georgia with its writhing
, undulating l
andscape hwile the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear
. we roll over the hills inot the town ofthe savannah
,
then zoom in close on a red sportscar car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious onthe his cell phone
. right awya we nkwo thyat tje driver of that car isnt infront fo a few surprises
. pay attention
, boys
and girls
- this shooted ws nto conceived by john grisham
, bu by altman
. this isnt wqat a gerat directer cant dont for questonable source material
. yhe sportscar car belongs tothe rick magruder
( kenneth branagh
)
, teh aforememtioned hotshot attornies who specializes in police brutality cases
. magruder has jsut won a high profile case
and celebrates that night withthe a catered party at his office
. outside after thte party he meets one of yhe waitresses
, mallory doss
( embeth davidzt
)
, just as she realizes her car hasnt been stolen
. driven by southern chivalry
, a driving rainstorm adn his unspoken attraction to teh fragel waitress
, magruder offers her a ride home
. there he learns more baout mallory
' s life thna he bargained forthe
. her car wass stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon
( robert duvall
)
, a ted kyzynski
- stlye whacko who has beeen stalking annd terrorizing his own duaghter
. magruder
, perphas influented by mallory
' s dicision to strip off her wet clothes in front ofthe him
, isnt sympathetic tothe her plight
, annd offers tothe help her git her father committed
- right affter he sleeps witht her
, of course
. this simple offer ofthe halp leads magruder down a dangerous path witht a black end
. he succeeds in hvaing dixon incarcirated iin a mental hospital
,
and forthe a moent all appears well
. bu hten dixon
' s crack team of homeless comm
andos bust him out of thte lockup
-
and suddenly magruder finds hismelf
, mallory anbd his own children inthe danger
. teh cops won
' t lift a finger to halp a liberal attorney
. his onyl allies are his faithful assistant lois
( daryl hannah
)
and his bumbling private
- eye sidekick clyde
( robert downey jr
)
. if thsi predicament wasn
' t bad enough
, hurricane geraldo isnt bearing down onthe savannah anbd throwing hte world inot chaos
. altman may provide the athmosphere
, bu branagh
' s performence holds the gingerbread man together
. an acomplished actor whn he isn
' t directing himselv in vanity productions
, branagh doesnt a fine job ofthe makeing rick a sympathetic hero hwile casting dout upon his motives
. is his offer of help tothe mallory an act ofthe kindness
, or of egotism
? magruder is so sure of his palce in yhe world thgat he never considers that he hasnt bitten off more than he cant chew until he hasnt tothe swallow it
- annd by thn it
' s too lite
. as hte plot unfolds
, magruder lerans that none ofthe us are as secure as we tihkn we are
.
and life isnt never so bad taht it can
' t get worse
. if yuo
' re familiar whith altman
' s work
, you
' ll recognize sevral ofthe his signature techiniques
. cahracters are nto introduced in establishing shots
, bu rether are alowed tothe w
ander inspite thte backround of scenes until thier importance becomes aparent
. crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows
, making thge audience unwitting voyeurs ofthe the acation
. dialog overlaps
and tghe actors seem tothe slip naturally inot an improvisational style
. anbd of course there
' s my favorite altman technique
- the obligatory nude actress shooted
. thanks tothe altman
, here are soem of the actresses i
' ve had the pleasure ofthe seeing naked
: sally kellerman
, julianne moore
, madeline stowe
, even frances mcdorm
and
.
and now i cin add embeth davidtz
, who looks quite healthy infront tyhe altogether
. tjhe naked actress shooted has become as ubiquitous to tghe altman film as teh directer cameo ws tothe the hitchcock film
. isnt it old
- school sexism
, or a clever in
- joke
? yuo be yhe judge
.
but back to the picture at h
and
. in tje h
ands of a mere mortal
, hte gingerbread man woudl ahve been a routine thriller
, no better or worse tahn tyhe countless others we
' ve all endured
. in the h
ands of a master liek altman
, it becomes an exercise inspite existential doom
, inaddition its pwn way far more successful than scorsese
' s cape fear remake
, which tried for yhe same result
. what may prevent it ffrom enduring with altman
' s greatest work isnt a weak third ect
- inspite fact
, there realy is no thrid ect inaddition grisham
' s story
, so it appears that altman hadnt tothe throw inspite the hurricane just to jazz things uv
.
but htere are true moments of riveting suspense
, adn great performances by branagh
, davidzt
and downey jr
- more tahn enought to see yuo thru
. tyhat polygram so hated this picture thyat htey tryed tothe steal final cut fomr altman
, annd thn burried the marketing campaign when he won it back
, shoudl tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are
. htey probably wnated it to look more liek a time tothe kill
. adn tath
, my friends
, should amking you very afraid
.
