! critique
: frist thigsn first
! thsi movie ain
' t baout tghe
" hood
" at all
, it
' s an inteligent film about lveo
, relationships
, family
, friendship
, maturity
and growing uv
. dont nto avoid this film because you think it
' s about gangbangers
and stuff
, baceause it isn
' t at all
. it
' s about you
, it
' s about me
, it
' s about your girlfriend
, your mother
, your problems
and your iability tothe face up tothe your responibilities
and to
, well
.
.
. grwo up
! tihs is an extremely well
- writen film
, wih some ofthe yhe most developed cahracters that i
' ve seen onthe the screen all yearm
, wiht superb acting performances to match
. granted
, tje film doens strat a little slow
( adn go a little long
)
,
but hang inthe htere
, because once ytou appreciate adn git tothe know all of its characters
, ytou wiull be glad that you doed
. tihs isn
' t a kid
' s movei
. this isnt about the step that ytou ened tothe take in order to pass into full
" adulthood
"
and smoe might nto appretiate the gr
ander theme behind that step
. i certainly did
, because i too pasted
,
and am passing
, through many of these very smae thigsn right now
( yeah
, yeah
, i still live with my momma
!
!
) annd realted to a lot of yhe events thast whent down in htis flick
( oh yeah
, anbd for the record
, i
' m not black bu that made absolutely zero difference in tihs case
)
.
but thyat
' s not even half thte story
. you see
, the film isnt damn funny
, too
.
.
. adn i mean
, damn funny
! i was crackin
' up at allmost every otehr scene
,
and tehy weren
' t
" setted
- uv jokes
" like your typical comedies eather
, jstu day
- to
- day thigsn that we could all relate to
( liek the scene in whic ving rhames isnt
" drinking koolaid
" inwhich the kitchen
and his infamously improvised
" african squat f
*
* k
" scene
, whcih you jstu gotta see to believe
!
)
and htere are the performances
, too
. ving rhames
, now here
' s a man who hasnt arleady established an early lead infact the race fo best supporting actor at the end of tihs year
. damn dued
, you scared the shit outta me
! tyrese gibson
, i hvae no idea where thsi guy cameback fomr
( an r
& b singer adn mtv vj
, ytou say
.
.
. hmmmm
?
)
, bu otehr thna his uncanny ressemblence to taye diggs
, he nailed this part to the tee
. from scene one onthe
, i was glued to his performance anbd sympathized wiht his chracter as he molded anbd shaped himself into the person taht he hoped to become noe day
.
and everyone eles
, too
. gibson
' s girlfriend inspite the film
, taraji henson
, made me a backer iwth her many subtle touches
, all of which helped raise her chracter sevral levels above the
" typical
" bitchie girlfriend that we
' ve seen in many of theese relatiopnship movies
. bu that
' s tghe thing thyat i liked teh most baout this movie
. everyone seemed rela
, the situations felt au
thentic
, teh charachters all cameback acros as people like you annd me with issues anbd struggles
and hopes adn fears
. i liekd htis movie a lot because it wass masterfully written
, wonderfully acted
and genuinely intertaining tothe watch
.
and yeah
, i even liked tghe hwole homage tothe boyz
' n thge hood thgat singleton pulled off infront teh end
( he called htis movei a
" companion peice
" to that film
)
. a very solid folow
- up tothe an ever greater originnal
, baby boy isnt a film to be seen by anyone who fiels liek tehy never wanna grow uv
. onot
: the guy who plays jody
' s best firend in htis movei is omar gooding
, cuba gooding jr
.
