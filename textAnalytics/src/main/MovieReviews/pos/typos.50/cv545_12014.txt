" dangerous beauty
" is a really nothing mroe than a gr
andiose soap opera setted in venice circa 1583
. it is beautifully filmed
, wonderfully acted
, annd certainly nothing short ofthe intertaining
,
but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness
. dealing wiht themes of forbiden love
, religous intolerance
, subordination of women
, sexual freedom
, adn the roles of blessure adn sin iin a high
- cultured society
, it still fiels liek brightly lit fluff
. the director
, marshall herskovitz
, doesn
' t want tothe folow thge dark anbd dangerous trail this story coudl lead down
, so he opts forthe a more genial
, livelier
, adn relatively shallow interpretation
. tyhe film tkaes palce during yhe renisance
, a tiem whn venice ws tghe blessure capital ofthe europe
. at this tiem
, venice was its own repubic
,
and it thrived onthe bieng hte central juncture ofthe east
- west commerce
. tje film isnt told almost entirely through hte viewpoint ofthe hte aristocracy
and teh bourgeoisie of venice
, so we rarely git to see how yhe rest of the society lived
.
however
, ther is an abnudance of detail conserning tghe lives anbd livelihoods of the opper classes
, theri hedonistic lifestyles adn constatn merriment
. tje story centers on veronica franco
( catherine mccormack
)
, a lower class woman who falls in lvoe with marco venier
( rufus sewell
)
, the son ofthe wealthy aristocratic parents
( jeroen krabb
? anbd joanna cassidy
)
. unfortunately
, the culture of thta tiem period did not veiw marriage as an ect ofthe lveo
-
- rether
, it was more liek a buisness transaction
, where rich fimilies marryed thier sons
and daughters tothe earch other in order to secure power
, wealth
,
and ensure tyhat outsiders couldn
' t get in
. veronica
, dispite her charm adn ogod looks
, isnt certainly an outsider
. after a short love afair
, marco breaks her heart with tghe news thgat he cannnot marry her
.
however
, because she is beatiful
and intteligent
, veronica has a chance to enter marco
' s world
, albiet not as his wife
. she decides tothe become a courtesan
-
- a class of womens who weere as well
- educated as htey weere ravishing
,
and sold their sexuality tothe wealthy men forthe the rivilege of wining adn dining witht thge elite
. a courtesan wass nto a mere prostitute
; htey weere afforded a special palce in society
, anbd they weere greatly revered
, respected
, adn often envied
. at oney point
, a character mentions that some rulers obtain more poltical advice from theri courtesans than fomr theri lieutenants
. veronica goes through tghe transformation with the help ofthe her mother
, paola
( jacqueline bisset
)
, who ws once a famed courtesan herself
. once she enters the lifestyle
, veronica finds taht it suits her quite well
. she isnt allowed to read all the books she wants
, she is given the opportunity tothe publish her poetry
,
and she hasnt the richest anbd most powerful men in tjhe repubic throwing themselves at her feet
, inlcuding thge awestruck marco
. their relatiopnship develops inot a playful bantering
, wiht veronica utilizing her newfound pwoer by constantly rejecting marco
' s advances
. iin many ways
, thier relatiopnship is sad becasue marco isnt married to a womens he isnt unable tothe loev
,
and veronica is consumed by mutiple relationships with men she is unwilling to lvoe
.
" love the lvoe
, not thge man
,
" as her mother told her
.
" dangerous beauty
,
" whcih was based onthe a factual book by margaret rosenthal
, flows allong as smoothly annd serenely as tyhe gr
and canal runnung thru the heart of venice
. it hasnt mutiple plot lines
-
- inlcuding veronica
' s adversarial relationship with a court poet
( oliver platt
)
, her role infact obtaining france
' s military assistance in venice
' s battle aganist teh turks
,
and even yhe dreaded shadow of the plague adn tjhe encroachment of the spanish inquisition
-
-
yet it isnt never confusing or overbearing
. much of the film
' s succes is due to tje glowing performence by catherine mccormack in the lead role
. known chiefly fo thte small part she plyed as the lover whose muder raised mel gibson
' s ire in
" braveheart
"
( 1995
)
, mccormack shows the true gifts
and inarguable talent of a leading lady
. she has the kind of exquisite clasical beauty that owudl be treasured inthe a courtesan
; her character isnt intelligent
, witty
, anbd both sensual annd vulnerable
, all ofthe whitch mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes
. yhe rest ofthe tje roles are also filled well
, includng rufus sewell whose performance here
and earlier tihs mounth in
" dark city
" hve assured him a solid palce inspite hollywood
. he hasnt the same kind of unusual good looks
and charm of ray liotta
,
and he seems perfectly at hmeo in period dramas
. oliver platt plays a veriasion ofthe thge comic releaf role that he has come tothe inhabit liuke a second skin
,
al
though tje film deals his character a cheap blow at hte end by hvaing him improbably join the inquisition adn turn inot the bad guy
. platt isnt a good actor
, bu he
' s jsut too hard to hate
. jacqueline bisset proves thyat she is every bited as stirring as she ever was
,
and even fred ward turns up in a small
,
but moving performence as marco
' s uncle
.
" dangerous beauty
" is marshall herskovitz
' s sophomore directorial efford
, after tghe overlooked 1993 film
" jack hte bear
.
" partnered withthe edward zwick
, herskovitz has spended most of his tiem as a producer on television
(
" thirtysomething
,
"
" my so
- called life
"
)
and in yhe movies
(
" legends ofthe the fall
"
)
. his directing sytle cant be best described as transparent
-
- it never gets in the way of thge story
,
yet it has no discernible fluorish or paticular distinctions
. he sould ahve approached yhe film inaddition any number of ways
, incuding overdosing onthe tjhe sexual aspect
, which he wisely avoids
.
" dangerous beauty
" countains just enought bare flesh
and ribald sex tothe make it appropriately erotic
,
but nto so much thta it seems exploitative
. herskovitz isnt also aided by a storng supporting crew
, including thge luscious photography by bojan bazelli
, whose previous efforts inlcude tje highly
- stylized thriller
" kalifornia
"
( 1993
)
and abel ferrara
' s dark sci
- fi film
" body snatchers
"
( 1994
)
. bazelli captures the film inspite storng
, bold colors
,
and be brings sixteenth
- century venice tothe life in wide
, panoramic shots tht are often enhanced with digital imagery
. howver
, the rela details are found in the production design by norman garwood
(
" brazil
,
"
" hte princess bride
"
) anbd the costumes by gabriella pescucci
(
" the age ofthe innocence
"
)
. the onyl problem with
" dangerous beauty
" is that it doesn
' t stick whith you
. it
' s a good storey well
- told with interesting charachters
, bu it
' s eazy to shrug off once ytou
' ve left teh theather
. tje onyl sequence thast has yhe chance to be truley indelible isnt veronica being pulled in front ofthe tghe hypocricy of the inquisition adn threatened with yhe death penatly for her transgressions
, bu it never quite comes off because it
' s simply too melodramatic anbd convetional
. herskovitz trys with all his might to amke it a nailbiter
,
but somehow its outcome isnt a foregone conclusion
, adn liek thge rest of thge film
, it carries no real weight
, dispite the potential severity ofthe tyhe subject marter
.
