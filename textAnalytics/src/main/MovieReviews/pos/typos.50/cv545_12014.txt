" dangerous beauty
" isnt a really nothing more thna a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583
. it isnt beautifuly filmed
, wonderfully acted
,
and certainly nothing short ofthe entertaining
,
but it lacks any true fundametal seriousness
. dealing whith themes of forebidden lveo
, religious intolerance
, subordination ofthe women
, sexual freedom
,
and tghe roles ofthe pleasure
and sin in a high
- cultured society
, it still feels like brightly lit fluff
. the directer
, marshall herskovitz
, doesn ' t whant to followup the dark
and dangerous trail tihs stoyr could lead down
, so he opts for a mroe genial
, livelier
,
annd relitavely shallow interpretation
. the film tkaes palce durig tjhe renisance
, a time wehn venice was tghe pleasure captial of europe
. at this tyme
, venice was its own repubic
,
and it thrived onthe being tjhe central juncture ofthe east
- west commerce
. the film isnt told almost entirely through tyhe viewpoint of hte aristocracy
and thte bourgeoisie of venice
, so we rarley git tothe see how the rest ofthe hte society lieved
.
however
, there isnt an abundance ofthe detail conserning hte lives
and livelihoods of the opper classes
, their hedonistic lifestyles
adn constant merriment
. tjhe stry centers onthe veronica franco
( catherine mccormack
)
, a lower class woman who falls in lveo with marco venier
( rufus sewell
)
, tyhe son ofthe wealthy aristocratic parents
( jeroen krabb
?
and joanna cassidy
)
. unfourtunately
, thge culture ofthe taht time preriod doed not veiw marrage as an act of love
-
- rather
, it was moreso liek a bussines transaction
, where rich families marryied theri sons
annd daughters to eahc other in order to secure power
, wealth
,
and ensure that outsiders couldn ' t git in
. veronica
, despite her charm
adn ogod looks
, isnt certainly an outsider
. affter a short loev afair
, marco breaks her heart with the news thgat he cannnot marry her
.
howver
, baceause she is beautyfull
annd intelligent
, veronica hasnt a chance tothe enter marco ' s world
, albiet not as his wief
. she decides tothe become a courtesan
-
- a class of womens who were as well
- educated as they were ravishing
,
and sold their sexuality tothe wealthy men for yhe priveledge of wining
annd dining with the elite
. a courtesan was not a mere prostitute
; tehy weere afforded a speical place infact society
,
adn they weere greatly revered
, respected
,
and often envied
. at noe point
, a carachter mentions that smoe rulers obtain omre political advice from thier courtesans than fomr their lieutenants
. veronica goes through hte transformaton with the help of her mother
, paola
( jacqueline bisset
)
, who was once a famed courtesan herself
. once she enters the lifestyle
, veronica finds that it suits her qtuie well
. she isnt alloween to read all hte books she wants
, she isnt given thte opportunity to publish her poetry
,
and she hasnt the richest
and most powerful men in the repubic throwing themselfs at her fezent
, including the awestruck marco
. thier relationship develops inot a playful bantering
, with veronica utilizing her newfound pwoer by constanly rejecting marco ' s advances
. in many ways
, thier relationship is sad because marco is married tothe a womens he is unable tothe lveo
,
and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to lvoe
.
" lvoe the love
, not the man
,
" as her mother told her
.
" dangerous beauty
,
" which was based onthe a factual book by margaret rosenthal
, flows allong as smoothly
adn serenely as tjhe grand canal runing thru teh heart ofthe venice
. it hasnt multiple plot lines
-
- including veronica ' s adversarial relatiopnship witht a court poet
( oliver platt
)
, her role in obtaining france ' s miltary assistance inspite venice ' s battle agaisnt tjhe turks
,
and even the dreaded shadow of the plague
annd thte encroachment of thte sanish inquisition
-
-
yet it is never confusing or overbearing
. much of teh film ' s success is due tothe tghe glowing performence by catherine mccormack inaddition yhe lead role
. known chiefly forthe teh small part she palyed as the lover whose murder rised mel gibson ' s ire in
" braveheart
"
( 1995
)
, mccormack shows thge true gifts
and inarguable talent ofthe a leading lady
. she hasnt the kind of exquisite classical beauty thast would be treasured infact a courtesan
; her character is intteligent
, witty
,
annd both sensual
adn vulnerable
, all of wich mccormack easily transmits with a single flash ofthe her eyes
. the rest of yhe roles are aslo filled well
, includng rufus sewell whose peformance here
annd earlier thsi month in
" dark city
" have assured him a solid palce in hollywood
. he hasnt tghe same kind of unusual good looks
adn charm ofthe ray liotta
,
and he seems perfectly at hmeo inaddition period dramas
. oliver platt plays a variation of the comic releaf role tht he has come to inhabitate like a second skin
,
although the film deals his character a cheap blow at tje end by having him improbably join tyhe inquisition
and turn inot the bad guy
. platt isnt a good actor
,
but he ' s just too hard to hite
. jacqueline bisset proves thast she isnt every bit as stirring as she ever was
,
anbd even fred ward turns up inthe a small
,
bu moving performance as marco ' s uncle
.
" dangerous beauty
" isnt marshall herskovitz ' s sophmore directorial effort
, after tjhe overlooked 1993 film
" jack tje bear
.
" partnered with edward zwick
, herskovitz has spended most of his timne as a producer onthe televsion
(
" thirtysomething
,
"
" my so
- called life
"
)
annd in the movies
(
" legends of tjhe fall
"
)
. his directing stlye cant be best decribed as transparent
-
- it never gets infront the way of teh tsory
,
yet it hasnt noone discernible fluorish or parituclar distinctions
. he coudl have approached thte film inspite any number ofthe ways
, incuding overdosing on yhe sexual aspect
, which he wisely avoids
.
" dangerous beauty
" countains just enough bare flesh
and ribald sex tothe amke it appropriately erotic
,
bu not so much that it seems exploitative
. herskovitz is also aided by a storng supporting crew
, includng tje luscious photography by bojan bazelli
, whose previous effords inlcude the highly
- stylized thriller
" kalifornia
"
( 1993
)
anbd abel ferrara ' s dark sci
- fi film
" body snatchers
"
( 1994
)
. bazelli captures the film in storng
, bold colors
,
and be brings sixteenth
- centruy venice tothe life iin wide
, panoramic shots tht are often enhanced with digital imagery
.
however
, the rela details are found in thte production design by norman garwood
(
" brazil
,
"
" the princess bride
"
)
adn yhe costumes by gabriella pescucci
(
" the age of innocence
"
)
. the only problem with
" dangerous beauty
" isnt that it doesn ' t stick whith yuo
. it ' s a ogod stroy well
- told with interesting charachters
,
bu it ' s easy to shrug off once you ' ve left teh theather
. thge onyl sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front ofthe the hypocracy of thge inquisition
adn threatend witht tjhe death penatly for her transgressions
,
bu it never quite comes off because it ' s simpley too melodramatic
and conventional
. herskovitz trys with all his might to make it a nailbiter
,
bu somehow its outcome isnt a foregone conclusion
,
and liek the rest ofthe the film
, it carries noone rela weight
, despite tyhe potential severity of tje subject matter
.
