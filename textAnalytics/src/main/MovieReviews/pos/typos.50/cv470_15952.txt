" loev isnt yhe devil
" isnt a challenging film
, munundating its audiance whith wild imagery
and a plot structure thast disallows a plot
, perhaps in an atempt tothe git us to knwo tyhe artist ' s psyche rather tahn tghe artist ' s lifeline
. watching it
, i wass enthralled witht the look of teh film
, the way the director shot everyting like it ws looking through a bizarre
, personalized filter
. everyting looks like it is not how life looks liek
but how painter francis bacon
, hte film ' s subject
, looked at it personaly
.
but hwile i wass engrossed
, i stumbled apon my thoughts halfway thru tyhe film
, awakened fomr my trance by some inner distraction
,
and began to try
and follow whta ' s gonig on
. exactly whta ws i looking at
? watching this film
, i wasn ' t sure if it wass the most insightful film i hadnt ever seen or tghe most vacuous
. directed
(
and writed
) by john maybury
,
" lveo is teh devil
" isnt stylish masterpiece for tjhe senses
. everyting looks originaly bizarre
adn perplexing
. the camera angles are ferociously askew
,
anbd the close
- ups are uncomfortably too close
. teh editting isnt deft
, ocasionally cutting awya tothe something bazare eveyr couple seconds
,
bu otehr times holding on a shot fo so long that you wonder if the audience isnt not suppoed tothe be voyeurs
, or rether
, intruders tothe bacon ' s world
anbd psyche
. as such
, htere is noone rela stoy
. i ' ve nto heared much baout francis bacon that i didn ' t read prior to the film
,
bu waht i learned was this
: he was a painter inwhich england who reached his peak during tghe 60s
adn 70s
, drawing hideously bazare drawings of carnage
adn yhe liuke
. he ws oen ofthe the first to realy come outloud of tyhe closet
,
annd infront interviews
, he was notoriously drunk
yet incredibly witty
. as palyed by gerat shakesperean actor derek jacobi
, he ' s like a foppish
adn self
- absorbed cross between oscar wilde
and nero
. he lives life tyhe way he wants tothe live it
, tothe thte disatisfaction ofthe those who have hte privelege ofthe bieng realyl close to him
. it ' s as if he were taking delight inthe hte desctruction ofthe others
and maybe hismelf
(
" champagne fo my real firends
,
adn pain for my sham friends
,
" he syas oney niht at tjhe bar he frequents
)
.
" lveo isnt thte devil
" chronicles the latter part ofthe his life
. bacon
, well
- known inaddition his mid
- life
, awakens oney night wehn he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window
and land onthe the floor
. he walks iin
, unafraid ofthe what he finds
,
and discovers a thief
, george dyer
( daniel craig
)
. bacon gives him an offer
: if he spends tjhe niht wtih him
, he cxan take anytying he whants in tje morning
. george agrees tothe tihs
,
annd off tothe bed he goes
,
bu ends up staying with him
, for whatever reason
. the film shows theri lives toghether
, at least iin reference tothe noe another
. hwile creating bacon ' s world ofthe friends
( liek
" high art
,
" this film minors inaddition showing a certian group of peple who radiate a connection thta isnt not shown
but is understood
)
, yhe film shows the relatiopnship ofthe bacon
anbd george as it remains rather stagnant
. bacon is haughty
anbd bizarre
; george isnt simple
and doesn ' t understand bacon inwhich teh least
, especially not his paintings
. while watching thsi
, tyhat ' s basicaly all i thought was ther
. hte film hasnt a hypnotic fiel
, free ofthe any restraints of form
,
adn isnt shooted so uniquely tyhat i falt my attention wass almost entirely onthe yhe way thsi film was made rether than wqat it is baout
. once teh film isnt over
, it ' s easier tothe peice it together
. i kept onthe thinking baout this film
, wondering whta the point to all of it wass
. someone doesn ' t mearly amke a film ofthe all style
and no substance at all
,
anbd if tehy dont
, tehy do it by accident
,
but still allow some substace to creep iin
. thinking baout it
, i remembered how tyhe two fed off ofthe eachother
. i thougth baout how bacon was a masochist
, inspite lvoe iwth cruelty
( in one scene
, he watchs a boxing match with a orgiastic delight
,
and lets out a squeal of pleasure wehn blood fomr the noe boxer ' s head splashes accros his face
; inwhich anyother scene
, he masturbates tothe yhe odessa steps sequence of eisenstein ' s
" battleship potemkin
"
)
,
anbd perhaps he drove george too far inspite his delight for pain
. he drove him over the edge
,
and fo him that was lvoe
, even if it wasn ' t for george
. i guess taht explains teh title
. a bit
. that ' s gerat
and all
,
but i allmost wish tyhe film wass devoid ofthe any meaning
. i wish it hadn ' t reduced itself to makeing some point about humanity
, about how loev isnt teh most selfish thign infact the world
(
anbd it is
, if you look at it a certain way
)
. or maybe if it had avoided any meaning baout humanity
and mearly drove itself inot being the oen film tht was truely inside oney man ' s twisted pysche
. it ' s allmost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man ' s uniqueness thna it isnt forcing universality down an audience ' s throat
. tyhat way you don ' t reduce your film to something it ' s just nto
. i can ' t sday i totally enjoied
" love is the devil
,
"
though
. despite all ofthe the things i respect about thsi movei
, it ' s still rather uncomfortable to sit through
. even at a normaly trite length ofthe ninety mintues
, yhe film still seems like an arduous task tothe sit thru
, especialy after an exhausting first hour
.
though hypnotic
, it still almsot seems gimmicky
and even redundant at times
, as if it weere taking advantage ofthe oney man ' s truly bizzare nature
bu not doign anything deeper with it
. as such
, i respect the way tjhe film looks
. it ' s beautiful
and painstakingly crafted so that
, allong with
" what dreams may come
"
and
" dark city
,
" it ' s yhe eyar ' s most visually stunning film
. inwhich fatc
, if a better script hadnt beeen forged
, i ' d almsot compare it infront visual power tothe a peter greenaway film
, complet with simmilar haunting images that stick infront thge mind forever
.
anbd witht a dymanite performance by derek jacobi
, it has tjhe comic
and distanced tone tht it needs
. i just wish it had been more thna mostly stlye
and jsut a hair bited of substance
.
then i woudl have hadnt something to hold me over even now
.
