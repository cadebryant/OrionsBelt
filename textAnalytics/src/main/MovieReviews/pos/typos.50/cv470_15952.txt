" loev is tje devil
" is a chalenging film
, munundating its audiance with wild imagery adn a plot stucture that disallows a plot
, perphas in an attemp tothe get us to nkow the artist
' s psyche rather tahn hte artist
' s lifeline
. watching it
, i ws enthralled with the look ofthe the film
, hte way the directer shot everthing liuke it was looking through a bizzare
, personalized filter
. everyting looks liek it isnt nto how life looks like
but how painter francis bacon
, the film
' s subject
, looked at it personaly
. bu hwile i wass engrossed
, i stumbled upon my
thoughts halfway thru tje film
, awakened fomr my trance by some inner distraction
, anbd began to try
and follow whta
' s goign on
. exactly what was i looking at
? watching htis film
, i wasn
' t sure if it was tghe most insightful film i had ever seen or yhe most vacuous
. directed
( anbd written
) by john maybury
,
" love isnt tyhe devil
" isnt stylish masterpiece for the senses
. everthing looks orignially bazare
and perplexing
. tje camera angles are ferociously askew
, annd hte close
- ups are uncomfortably too close
. thge editing isnt deft
, occasionally cutting away to something bazare eveyr cuple seconds
,
but other times holding onthe a shot forthe so long that you wonder if the audiance isnt not supposed to be voyeurs
, or rether
, intruders to bacon
' s world
and psyche
. as such
, there is noone rela story
. i
' ve nto heard much about francis bacon taht i didn
' t read prior to the film
, bu waht i learned wass this
: he wass a painter infront engl
and who reached his peak durig the 60s
and 70s
, drawing hideously bizzare drawings ofthe carnage
and the like
. he ws one ofthe the first to really cmo out ofthe the closet
,
and infront interviews
, he ws notoriously drunk yot incredibly witty
. as palyed by great shakesperean acotr derek jacobi
, he
' s like a foppish annd self
- absorbed cross vetween oscar wilde annd nero
. he lives life the way he wants to live it
, tothe thte disatisfaction of thsoe who hvae the privelege of being relaly close tothe him
. it
' s as if he were tkaing delight iin the destruction ofthe others
and maybee himself
(
" champagne fo my rela firends
, anbd pain fo my sham firends
,
" he syas one night at the bar he frequents
)
.
" loev is yhe devil
" chronicles thge latter part ofthe his life
. bacon
, well
- known in his mid
- life
, awakens oen night whn he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window annd l
and on tjhe floor
. he walks inaddition
, unafraid ofthe whta he finds
,
and dicovers a theif
, george dyer
( daniel craig
)
. bacon gives him an offer
: if he spends yhe nihgt witht him
, he cin take anytying he wants inaddition the morning
. george agrees to htis
, adn off to bed he goes
,
but ends uv staying with him
, for whatever reason
. the film shows their lives toghether
, at least in rfeerence tothe one another
. hwile creating bacon
' s world of firends
( liek
" high art
,
" this film minors in showing a certain group of peple who radiate a conection taht is not shown bu isnt understood
)
, tyhe film shows the relatiopnship of bacon anbd george as it remains rether stagnant
. bacon isnt haughty annd bazare
; george isnt simple anbd doesn
' t underst
and bacon in thge least
, especially not his paintings
. while watching tihs
, tath
' s basicly all i throught wass there
. the film hasnt a hypnotic feel
, free of any restraints of form
,
and is shooted so uniquely tht i felt my attention was almost entirely onthe tghe way this film ws made rether than what it is about
. once tjhe film isnt over
, it
' s easier to peice it toghether
. i kept on thikning about this film
, wondering wqat the point to all ofthe it wass
. someone doesn
' t merely amking a film of all stlye
and noone substace at all
, annd if tehy do
, tehy dont it by accident
, bu still allow some substance to creep in
. thinking baout it
, i remembered how the two fed off ofthe eachother
. i thougth about how bacon was a masakist
, infact love wtih cruelty
( in oen scene
, he watchs a boxing match with a orgiastic delight
,
and lets out a squeal ofthe pleasure whn blood from tjhe oney boxer
' s head splashes across his face
; iin another scene
, he masturbates tothe teh odessa steps sequence of eisenstein
' s
" battleship potemkin
"
)
,
and perhaps he drove george too far inwhich his delight forthe pain
. he drove him over the edge
,
and fo him thta was love
, even if it wasn
' t for george
. i guess that explains teh title
. a bit
. that
' s graet
and all
,
but i almsot wish the film was devoid ofthe any meaninng
. i wish it hadn
' t reduced itself to making soem point about humanity
, about how love isnt yhe most selfish thing infront tyhe world
(
and it is
, if you look at it a certain way
)
. or maybe if it hadnt avoided any meaning baout humanity
and merely drove itself inot bieng thte oney film that ws truely inside noe man
' s twisted pysche
. it
' s almost alwyas best tothe obtain insights from looking at one man
' s uniqueness than it isnt forcing universality down an audeince
' s throat
. tht way ytou don
' t reduce your film to something it
' s just nto
. i cant
' t say i totally enjoyed
" loev isnt teh devil
,
"
though
. dispite all of yhe things i respect about this movei
, it
' s still rether uncomfortable tothe sit through
. even at a normaly trite lenght of ninty mintues
, the film still seems liek an arduous task tothe sit through
, especialy aftter an exhausting first hour
.
though hypnotic
, it still almost seems gimmicky
and even redundant at times
, as if it were taking advantage ofthe one man
' s truly bizarre nature bu not doing anytying deeper with it
. as such
, i respect the way thge film looks
. it
' s beautifull
and painstakingly crafted so tath
, allong with
" what dreasm may cmo
" anbd
" dark city
,
" it
' s tjhe yearm
' s most visually stunning film
. infront fatc
, if a better scirpt had beeen forged
, i
' d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film
, complete with similar haunting images that stick inthe the mind forever
. anbd with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi
, it hasnt tjhe comic annd distanced tone that it needs
. i just wish it hadnt beeen more tahn mostly sytle
and just a hair bited of substace
.
then i woudl ahev hadnt something tothe hold me over even nowe
.
