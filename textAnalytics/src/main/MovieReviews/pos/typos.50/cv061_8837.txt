ther ' s an ood saying tyhat states something baout leaving the best forthe last
. george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the origonal star wars trilogy
. return of tje jedi
, yhe fianl installment ofthe the serieses
, isnt easily the most inovative
, acation
- packed
,
and intertaining of the three films
. hte dark
, eerie athmosphere thgat oozed ffrom every frame of the empire strikes bakc is gone
. instade
, fo return of the jedi
, we have good triumphing decisively over evil
, a resolution to a love triangle
,
and walking teddy bears
. even darth vader doesn ' t seem very intimidating thsi time around
. wtih the arrival of tje emperor
( an apparition
- like creature played by ian mcdiarmid
)
, vader has turned into somewhat ofthe a henchman
. return ofthe thge jedi picks uv at an unspecified time after yhe conclusion ofthe the empire strikes back

( kenny baker
) are onthe a rescue mission tothe luke ' s hmeo planet ofthe tatooine
. their goal
: to savve han solo
( harrison ford
) ffrom tje clutches ofthe the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt
. it isnt at jabba ' s hmeo
, a creepy
- looking stone fortress guarded by hog
- nosed beasts
, that most of the added speshal effects come inot play
. from a hysterical scene involving a music gropu to tghe dreaded beast outside jabba ' s sand barge
, the effects are top nitch
. as soon as han is freed fomr his cryo
- freeze
and rescued from hte clutches ofthe thte evil jabba the hutt
, it ' s back tothe outer spoace
, where the rebel alloance is baout to face hte empire ' s newest threath
: a second
, more powerful death star
, thta
, if activated
, coudl spell doom fo anyone who stands aginst tjhe emperor
. so
, hwile the fleet prepares for tyhe final battle
, luke
annd company travel to tyhe forrest moon of endor to knock outloud the shield that defends tghe death star against all attacks
. ther
, htey are befriended by tghe ewoks
, teh teddy bear
- like native race
,
and luke
, fearing that his presence isnt endangering yhe gropu
, turns himself over tothe vader
. return ofthe the jedi hasnt smoe interesting elements
. tghe scenes which pitted luke agaisnt the emperor
and vader are suitably tense
adn well
- acted
. from a technical point
- of
- view
, tyhe space battles are amazing
, easily hindering anything depicted inthe the previvous films
. not onyl are ther many
, many moreso ships
,
bu their speed
and range of movement have been dramatically improved
. onthe noe level
, return of tje jedi is almost worth watching fo the spacial effects
. inaddition tje speshal edition
, even more ships are added
, making tje fianl space battle incredibly funn to watch
. the acting iin return ofthe yhe jedi isnt stronger tahn in thte previous films
. by nowe
( or
then
- 1983
)
, mark hamill
, harrison ford
,
and carrie fisher hve all matured in their onthe
- screen personas
. hte chemestry amongst yhe trio isnt terific
. as in empire
, billy dee williams gives us anohter human hero to root for
. newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy
, cunning
,
and evil creature
,
although he ' s not as imposing as vader was inthe star wars
.
although it ws grat fun watching star wars
adn tghe empire strikes back onthe the big screen
, return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment
. with the spectauclar
, new special effects
, hte adorable ewoks
, hte sinister jabba the hutt
, teh evil emperor
, the smae ood millenium falcon
, darth vader ' s incredible betrayal
, hte destruction ofthe the new death star
,
anbd the always lovable yoda
, return of the jedi concludes noe ofthe thte greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang
. congratulations tothe george lucas
, whose innovative mind entertains us nowe
and wiull continue to entertain generations tothe come
.
