mickey mouse hadnt better watch his bcak
-
- there ' s a new critter inwhich town
,
adn he ' s tjhe nameless animal attraction ofthe
" mouse hunt
,
" dreamworks skg ' s clever first foray into familiy fare
.
althought it runs out of steam towards its end
, this live
- action comedy still boasts enought energized slapstick
anbd inventive setted pieces tothe best disney ' s entire 1997 non
- animated
, kiddie
- orientated catalog
.
.
.
bu consdider tht list includes dismal tripe like
" air bud
,
"
" flubber
"
annd
" tyhat darn cat
,
"
adn it ' s really not such a difficult feat to pul off
. still
, throw the two rodents infront a boxing arena
,
and i ' ll be hoping taht tjhe mouse from
" mouse hunt
" knocks some sense bcak into mickey
. nathan lane
( robin williams ' signficiant other fomr
" the birdcage
"
)
and lee evans
( lastest seen as a nervous bellhop iin
" the fifth element
"
) play ernie
and lars smuntz
, befuddled brothers who hvae just inherited two unwanted assets from theri lite father
( william hickey
, in his last role
)
-
- a dilapidated ood string factory
and a dilapidated old mension
.
although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep thte former
, he
adn ernie deside to sell the latter fo big bucks after learning it was dessigned by a famed architect
.
but ther ' s a lone obstacle in theri way
-
- a single mouse lives within yhe walls ofthe teh hous
,
anbd he ' s not about to give up his palce ofthe residance wihtout a fight
. movies aimed at young audiences are rarley this visually exquisite
. tje effects blending the talents of 60
- some live mice
, oney animatronic mouse
and one computer
- generated mouse are pretty seamless
. the splendid production desgin seems to be straight outloud of tim burton ' s mind
; the smuntz ' s architecturally
- unsound mension is like something straight out of
" the nightmare befor christmas
,
"
anbd yhe vortex ofthe bizarre machinery in theri factory resembles some ofthe vincent price ' s warped contraptions from
" edward scissorhands
.
"
" mouse hunt
" is a preety dark movei
-
- even smoe ofthe tjhe humor cant be grim
-
-
but it ' s hardly ever mean
- spirited
. the star of hte show isnt niether the top
- billed lane nor the titular mouse
. it ' s lanky british comedian evans
, whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned
- uv jim carrey wihtout hte obnoxious overkill
( onot a toned
- down
bu nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease
)
; evans ' banter with tjhe ever
- affable lane is funny stuff
, too
,
and holds its pwn against tje movei ' s omre flashy fysical shtick
. vicki lewis
( beth from
" newsradio
"
) isnt solid inaddition a supporting role as lars ' moey
- grubbing wief
.
and in a nifty bited of novelty casting
, christopher walken isnt a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a littel too seriously
, popping a droping into his mouth
annd noting tothe his tape recorder thast the mouse hasnt a
" calcium deficiency
.
" blech
. a basically oney
- joke idea
-
- a mouse outsmarts a cuple of bumbling humans
-
- is given a rather engaging excecution
. their sparring is imaginatively realized
( i don ' t think i ' ll ever forget tje sighth ofthe thgat tiny littel mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel ofthe gouda
)
,
and
althought you relaly never fully root fo either side
, that ' s okay
-
- a warm
-
anbd
- fuzzy union bewteen thte two parties is practicly promised from hte first frome htey share
.
" mouse hunt
" may take a hwile tothe get going
( the rether lengthy set
- uv could test the patience of some ofthe yhe younger children
,
allthough i rather liekd it
, much inwhich part tothe lane
adn evans
)
,
and the climactic sequence is alowed tothe play out fo a bit too long
,
but thsi appears tothe be one familiy movei thgat most members of yhe family wiull be able tothe fidn agreeable
, nto unlike the original
" hmeo alone
