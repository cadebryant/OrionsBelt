mickey mouse hadnt better watch his bcak
-
- htere
' s a new critter in town
,
and he
' s the nameless animal attraction ofthe
" mouse hunt
,
" dreamworks skg
' s clever firt foray into familiy fare
.
al
though it runs outloud of steam towords its end
, thsi live
- action comedy still boasts enought energized slapstick anbd inventive setted pieces tothe best disney
' s entire 1997 non
- animated
, kiddie
- orientated catalog
.
.
.
but consdider tyhat list includes dismal tripe like
" air bud
,
"
" flubber
"
and
" that darn cat
,
"
and it
' s really nto such a difficult foat tothe pull off
. still
, throw tje two rodents infront a boxing arena
, anbd i
' ll be hoping tht teh mouse from
" mouse hunt
" knocks smoe sense back into mickey
. nathan lane
( robin williams
' significant otehr from
" the birdcage
"
)
and lee evans
( lsat seen as a nervous bellhop in
" the fifth element
"
) play ernie anbd lars smuntz
, befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from thier late father
( william hickey
, inwhich his lastr role
)
-
- a dilapidated old string factory
and a dilapidated ood mension
.
al
though lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the fromer
, he
and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it ws dessigned by a famed architect
. bu htere
' s a lone obstacal in their way
-
- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house
,
and he
' s nto about tothe give up his place ofthe residance wihtout a fight
. movies aimed at young audiences are rarely tihs visually exquisite
. the effects blending the talents ofthe 60
- smoe live mice
, oen animatronic mouse anbd oney computer
- generated mouse are pretty seamless
. the splendid prodcution desgin seems to be straight out of tim burton
' s mind
; the smuntz
' s architecturally
- unsound mansion isnt like something straight out of
" the nightmare before christmas
,
"
and teh vortex of bazare machinery in thier factory resembles smoe of vincent price
' s warped contraptions from
" edward scissorh
ands
.
"
" mouse hunt
" is a pretty dark movei
-
- even smoe of the humer cxan be grim
-
-
but it
' s hardly ever mean
- spirited
. thte star ofthe tjhe show isnt neither tjhe top
- billed lane nor the titular mouse
. it
' s lanky brittish comedian evans
, whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned
- uv jim carrey wihtout thte obnoxious overkill
( onot a toned
- down bu nontheless outrageous impromptu striptease
)
; evans
' banter iwth the ever
- affable lane isnt funny stuf
, too
, annd holds its pwn against tghe movie
' s more flashy physical shtick
. vicki lewis
( beth fomr
" newsradio
"
) isnt solid in a supporting role as lars
' moey
- grubbing wief
.
and in a nifty bited ofthe novelty casting
, christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously
, popping a dropping inot his mouth
and noting tothe his tape recorder thast the mouse has a
" calcium deficiency
.
" blech
. a basicaly oney
- joke idae
-
- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans
-
- isnt given a rather engaging excecution
. theri sparring isnt imaginatively realized
( i don
' t htikn i
' ll ever foreget tjhe sighth ofthe thta tiny littel mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel ofthe gouda
)
,
and
al
though you really never fully root for eather side
, that
' s okay
-
- a warm
-
and
- fuzzy union vetween the twpo parties is practicaly promised from thte first frame they share
.
" mouse hunt
" may take a while tothe get going
( tjhe rather lenghty setted
- uv could tust the patience of smoe of the yuonger childen
, altho i rether liekd it
, much infact part to lane anbd evans
)
,
and yhe climactic sequence isnt alowed tothe play out fo a bit too long
,
but this appears tothe be one famaly movie tyhat most members ofthe yhe family iwll be able tothe fidn agreeable
, not unlike the original
" home alone
.
