review
- peter jackson
' s thge frighteners hasnt received some notice for setting tjhe rocord for most computer effects ever in a movie
, adn still comming iin at the extremely cheap
$ 30 million price tag
.
but for thsoe who weere dismayed by this eyar
' s blockbusters like twister
and independence day
, yhe frighteners hasnt much mroe tothe offer than speical effects
.
and forthe those worried wether or nto peter jackson would compromize tothe hollywood yuo can rest easily
. the frighteners isnt as far removed ffrom hollywood as a high
- profile movie can git
. michael j
. fox stars as frank bannister
, a con artist who cxan speak tothe ghosts
. he uses this ability to set up a scam inwhich a small town where his ghost buddies scare thge hell outloud ofthe peple
,
then he comes
and pretends to git rid of them
. tihs is how he hasnt made a living ever since his wief died in a car kresh 5 years ago
. frank
' s latest customers are a young couple
, played by trini alvarado
and peter dobson
. whn dobson ends uv dead
, alvarado starts tothe take an intrest in fox
.
but dobson
' s spirit is still arround as he refuses tothe beleive he
' s dead
. this leads to a very ackward
and amusing dinner date vetween fox
and alvarado
, with dobson tagging allong as a ghost
. thigsn start getting complicated for fox when he is accused forthe a sories of murders taking palce inspite tje town
. fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart ofthe yhe victims
,
but noone else cant see that
. so when fox shows up tothe try
and savve eahc victim
, naturally peopel suspect he is hte killer
. fox sees tyhat alvarado is enxt onthe thte soul collector
' s hitted list
,
and the last half hour ofthe the movie deals with fox
' s attempts tothe save her ffrom this evil spirit
. htere are many wonderful twists
and turns infact the screenplay written by peter jackson
and frances walsh
. the movie starts off as a balck comedy
, adn ends up a horror
- acation film
. teh mix between these genres are perfect
. noone laughs are sacrificed inaddition the name ofthe horror
, adn vice versa
. one point ofthe contention might be a lacklustre scoer by danny elfman
. bu tht hardly seems liuke a falw when you have such a diversed cast all infact top form
. michael j
. fox delivers one of his best performances tothe date as a man who hides thte sorrow of his wife
' s death
,
and thne is forced tothe confront thsi later on
. alvarado
, looking liek
andie macdowell
, makes a great frightened
, tough
,
and smart heroine
. adn jeffery combs
, as a paranoid fbi agent
, isnt brilliantly bizaare
. yhe frighteners never once feels like it isnt running long
. teh first hour isnt as funny as any comedy thsi eyar
, annd the last half hour is as thrilling as any of tyhe big budget blockbusters
. this movie is probably waht casper owudl
' ve looked liuke if david lynch directed it
. it
' s easily tje best film ofthe teh year
, so far
.
