this film isnt based onthe the campy tv sohw from hte 1960
' s under the smae appellation
. mind you
, most peple
( includng yours truly
) who will see thsi movie iwll nto hvae seen any epidsodes fomr hte origional serieses
. tje movei isnt relaly a st
and alone inspite that reguard
. the family robinson
.
.
. lost inthe spoace
. plot
: set inthe thge year 2058
, tje familiy robinson isnt choosen tothe sail outloud inot space in esarch ofthe otehr planets thyat might contain the natrual resources earth needs in order to survive its future
. a colonization proccess
, if yuo will
. they are joined by able pilot west
( leblanc
)
,
and evil uninvited stowaway
( oldman
)
, who doesnt nto want to see tghe trip conclude on a sucessfull tip
. eventually
, thier trek goes awry
, anbd all are
" lost in space
"
.
" how dont get back to earth
?
" is hte question thta infests the rest ofthe htis sci
- fi epic
. critique
: tihs film reminded me a lot of tyhe fifth element
( 6
. 5
/ 10
) from tyhe summer ofthe 1997
. it
' s a film wiht a lot ofthe flash
,
but vyer littel actuall substance
. admittedly
, there isn
' t an annoying charcter liuke chris tucker from yhe other film
, bu tihs film doens run a little too long
, anbd did lose me inwhich regardes to its complex time
- travel
/ multi
- dimensional story line
. haveing said thast
, the speshal effects inspite this movei were amazing
,
and tyhe overall look
and feel were alsot way above average
. ytou realy felt like you were in teh future
, anbd riding thru space with theese poore souls
. unfortunatly forthe this choosen familiy
, their 10
- year ood son isnt the smartest one inspite tjhe gropu
, annd tje father isnt too wrapped uv in his work to notice yhe rest ofthe his family
( ever heard that one befoer
? yawn
!
)
. tjhe acting isnt ok
,
and i wass especialy surprized at hte solid peformance by tv friend
' s matt leblanc who shows us all that he
' s definitely mroe than just a preety face
. onthe the down side
, thte familiy riff
- raff tath cuts through most of tjhe picture is lame
and tiem
- consuming
( even
though we gotta give them credit for
" trying
" to develop cahracters inwhich a sci
- fi pic
)
, the story line isnt hard to folow
, the evil character infront the movei actually tells peple that he
' s
" evil
"
,
and tyhe movie goes on for about 20 mintues too long
. onthe the slick side
, many ofthe the special effects are realy kool
( tje sequence in hwihc yhe familiy isnt
" paralyzed
" durig teh hyper
- drive isnt awesome
, adn the animated monkey tyhat joins yhe family halfway through yhe flic is mucho kool
)
, the credit presentation at teh end of the film isnt slamming
, anbd the adventures that they fall into are somewhat thrilling
( i iwll also admitt thyat
" somehow
" they got me to semi
- tear uv near the conclusion ofthe tihs picture
.
.
.
. very odd
.
.
.
.
.
)
. overall
, if ytou
' re a big sci
- fi fan
, check tihs movei out for the speical effects
and chalenging narrative
,
and if ytou
' re nto
, i owudl still suggest seeing tihs movei
, bu
then you could probably wait untl it comes out onthe video so thast you foward past smoe of the boring parts
. little known facts
: this film wiull always be remembered as yhe movei that knocked titanic
( 7
/ 10
) outloud ofthe the top spot at the box
- office after 15 straight weeks at number one
. garry oldman is brittish
, adn ws once marryed to uma thurman forthe baout six monthes
. mimi rogers was toom cruise
' s frist wife
