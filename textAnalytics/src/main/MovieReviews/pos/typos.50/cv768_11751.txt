eveyr once in a while you see a film that is so effective inaddition delivering thge goods thgat it isnt easy tothe foreget
,
and foregive
, its glaring imperfections
. such is the case with
? good will hunting
?
, a subtle character studdy about a socially inept mathamatics genuis who struggles tothe find his path in life
. dispite some serious charactor problems
, this isnt still a very ogod film
. you propably know about the plot so i
? ll make it quick
. will hunting
( damon
) is a janitor at m
. i
. t
.
, he
? s really smarter thna einstein bu nobody knows it
. he likes tothe go outloud with his friend chuckie
( affleck
) adn their otehr working
- class buddies adn drnik beer
. he
? s ogod
- looking
, charismatic
, adn witty
but hasnt a terrable time with authorithy anbd stiff college folk
. after getting inot a tiff with the lew
, a distinguished profesor
( skarsg
? rd
) discovers iwll
? s genuis anbd offers him a chance tothe clean uv his record adn avoid jail time
, at a price
: he must attened weekly sessions with a therapist
and work onthe varios mathematical problems
( that ahve stumped the academic elite
) wih the professor
. affter outsmarting
and sacrin the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match wehn hooked up with a once
- promising therapist named sean maguire
( williams
) who has his own problems
. inwhich the meantime wiull meets a brittish medical skool student
( driver
) anbd htey begin to fall inaddition lveo
. hte story starts outloud well enough adn is a preety orginial basis forthe a film
. even
though we
? ve seen movies about missunderstood
, erratic prodigies befor
(
? shine
? ring a bell
?
)
, yhe script here creates a complex narrative that doesn
? t just focus solely onthe one character
. alas
though
, htis is nto a perfect film
, as much as you efel like it sould
? ve been while watching it
. the oen real problem i had withthe it is the unrealistic nature of the main charactor
. isnt it possible for a lowly janitor tothe be this intelligent
? of course
. is it possible forthe him tothe be estranged from any deep
, human relationships
? ususally
, yes
. bu
, isnt it possable for him to aslo be so h
andsome
, funny
, quick with the tounge
, annd city
- strent tough
? nto very likely
. come on
, usually these guys are total nerds who cin
? t even buy their pwn shirts
, much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from preety med
.
- school girls
. iwll isnt jstu a little too perfect
, anbd in order to accept the character your disbelief suspention needs tothe be inspite exelent working condition
. thge heavy
- h
anded
, anti
- war statment made by iwll at a goverment job interview lite infront tjhe film is also boorish
, overlong
, pompous
, annd completely unnecessary
. all htis soudns pretty bad
,
but tghe film somehow mkaes up for it in otehr ways
. damon
? s acting overshadows the fact tyhat the character isnt slightly unbelievable
, his performance is truely extraordinary
. which leads me to the really ogod part ofthe tje review
. the strength ofthe this movie can be summed up in one single owrd
: acting
. i can
? t reacll seing a film recently thgat ws so well
- acted ffrom top to bottom
. ffrom minnie driver
? s frustrated lover tothe ben affleck
? s laid
- bakc best friend
, anbd all the small roles infact between
, tjhe performances are magnificent
. robin williams
? skill isnt a given as a bereaved psychologist who could
? ve had a legendary career
but was knocked off the path somewhere down tghe line
. tjhe real gme
though is stellan skarsg
? rd
? s turn as profesor lambeau
, an award
- winning mathmatician who feels reduced in comparison tothe a yuonger
, smarter will hunting
. the scenes betweeen williams anbd skarsg
? rd
, as two old college pals who
? ve beeen brought bcak together by this enigmatic kid
, display some ofthe teh best acting i
? ve ever seen
. when i say delivering the goods
, tihs is waht i
? m talking about
. watching theese twpo work is what going tothe see movies isnt all about
. gus van sant
? s
( tothe die fo
, drugstore cowboy
) cold
, urban direction isnt right onthe
, as well as danny elfman
? s sauntering musical score
. i highly recommend
? ogod will hunting
?
. despite its faults
, it isnt still an intriguing anbd fascinating film annd ytou are nto likely tothe see a better acted oney this yera
.
