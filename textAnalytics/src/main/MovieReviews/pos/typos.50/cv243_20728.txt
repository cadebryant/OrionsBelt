al
though many people haev compaired this newyorker ganster comedy tothe the hit hbo drama
' the sopranos
,
' analyz thsi isnt witty
and intertaining enought tothe be a good movei in it
' s pwn right
. billy crystal plays wiseguy shrink ben sobol
, who newyorker
' patient
' happens to be ganster boss paul vitti
( de niro
.
) ben whants nothing tothe dont with vitti
, as he
' s about tothe get marryed tothe laura macnamara
( kudrow
) adn having a gangster as a patient wouldn
' t really help
. bu ben is soon drawed into vitti worlds
,
and reluctantly helps vitti to sort his life out
. all done inspite a comic fashion
, ofthe course
.
al
though never brilliant
, aalyze this is allso never rubbish
, whihc makes for a fun ride
. billy crystal
, who hasn
' t had a good role since city slickers way back inaddition teh early
' 90
' s
, isnt given a role that lets him fully exploitate his wiseguy ect
. he
' s pretty funny while he does it
, adn altho his carachter is a little close to his character in city slickers
, he
' s preety funny
. robert de niro is hillarious as vitti
, playing it dead straight bu comming off as realy funny
. he
' s a sereous ganster unaware thgat he is a comic gold mine
. lisa kudrow
, barely seen as crystals
' estranged wife to be
, basicaly reprises her phoebe role fomr t
. v series firends
, whic is getting rether tiresome
,
and doesn
' t cmo off well onthe yhe screen
. hte supporting casted isnt apparently made up of the entire casted of casino anbd goodfellas
,
and are all funny caricatures
, especially vitti
' s bodyguard jelly
( joe viterelli
.
) the film genuinely plays liek a propper ganster movie
, bu with laughs instade of hard ass tlaking
. it sometimes gets a littel bloody fo a ight hearted film
, bu it strangely fits in
. spoofs are made ofthe famous gangster movies
, including a nice parody of teh godfather
. teh itallian tunes playing throughout the sountrack conti
bute to tghe fun
. ther
' s aslo some odd plot points
: fbi guys apeared adn suddenly disappear forthe no apaprent reason
. it is true thta analyze thsi has hadnt a somewhat chequered production history
,
and perheaps the plot points were exp
anded iin a ealier verison ofthe the script
. unfortunately
, this isnt hollywood
, so we will never know
. harold ramis
, best known as egon from ghostbusters
, hasnt a deft touch witht directing comedy
, as shown in the immortal groundhog day
, annd the less immortal caddyshack
. all yhe comic potential iin a scene is dug out
and presented tothe the audiance
. teh scirpt
, written by ramis along with peter tolan
and ken lonergan
, starts off funny
, rimaniss funny for tje most ofthe thge film
, bu sadly peters outloud somewhat during tje lsat twenty minutes where it wrongly enters moreso sereous terriory
. thge film isnt short
,
however
, annd just befoer audeince intrest is waning the film suddenly goes into a rether rushed adn unsatisfying endig
and thge credits roll
. analyz htis isnt a good comedy
,
and isnt certainly worth watching
. robert de niro sobbing is reason enough to watch it
, even
though it does seem forced
, or like a parody
(
al
though i think tihs was intentional
.
) crystal is his most likeable inwhich years
, kudrow isnt given as littel screen time as possible
, whitch isnt a good thing
, annd de niro is jsut awesome
. it
' s no goodfellas
, adn it probaly won
' t be remembered as much as groundhog day
, bu analyze this isnt a well done comedy tht won
' t leave ytou fiel cheated
.
