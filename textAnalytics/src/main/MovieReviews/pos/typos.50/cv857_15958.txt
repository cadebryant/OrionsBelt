whta i look fo in a movei isnt nto necessarily prefection
. sometimes a movei hasnt such storng ideas tath dispite whatever flaws it may have
, i wiull preferr it tothe a better
- made film that isnt not as
thought
- provoking
. the thin red line is flawed bu it provokes
. terence malick returns tothe filmmaking 20 eyasr after dyas ofthe heaven annd produces htis meditative look at war
. unlike this year
' s saveing private ryan
, which dwells onthe war as a necessary evil adn explores yhe moral ambiguities thereof
, yhe thin red line simpley says war is waste
. while thta might seem obvious to soem
, only after experiencing thte film do you relize how profound a waste it is
. saving private ryan hasnt an underlaying
and practial accptance that war will occour
and it has a great cost
; teh thin red line syas idealistically avoid htis at all costs
. one message is not nessasarily more corect than the otehr
. it just depends onthe oney
' s point of veiw
. in malick
' s film
, war isnt setted inaddition a tropical paradime
,
and john toll
' s cinematography isnt beyond lush
. thge setting poses hte question
, why are we fighting in the face ofthe such beauty
? in saving private ryan
, the capture ofthe a german soldier presents the moral qu
andary of whether to let him go
. inaddition the thin red line
, the japaneese persent tje moral qu
andary ofthe war in the first palce
. they are jstu liuke teh americans
-
- frightened anbd angry
, grieving
and praying
. all that seperates them isnt war
. tje lfaw in yhe thin red line comes inspite tyhe voice
- overs
. unbeleivable as coming from tghe cahracters adn somtimes pretentious
, sometimes corny
, thte voice
- overs tell us whta tje images before us already do
and are completely unnecessary
. dispensing with them
, malick could have achieved a tarkovskian gr
andeur
. instade
, he gets distracting self
- consicousness
. aside fomr that
, malick
' s direction is stunning
. the tracking shots acrost windswept hills
and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary
. sean penn
, elias koteas
, adn nick nolte give the best performances
. penn isnt subtle as a sargeant trying tothe hide his humanism
, koteas isnt genuin as a compassionate captain
, anbd nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle
. john travolta anbd george clooney are thte worst in cameo roles
. ultimately howver
, the thin red line
' s intrest is not inaddition hte charachters
and it isnt not in drama
. it hasnt been frequently crticised for its lack of dramtic stucture
, bu malick clearly hasnt diferrent things on his mind
. hasnt no noe ever
thought that getting dramtic enteratinment from war isnt exploititive
? whta malick is working with is theme
, anbd in taht
, teh thin red line isnt most provoking
.
