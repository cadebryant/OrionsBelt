whn i initially setted outloud to review htis film
, my tag line was going to be
" you too cxan belieev whales cant fly
"
.
then it was going tothe be
" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly
"
.
then
, it was oging tothe be
" you too cxan beieve woud sprites can fly
"
. finaly
, i just gave uv trying to come up with a tag line
and decided to say
.
.
. there
' s a lot of flying goign on inspite this film
! as our first host steve martin tells us
, teh originnal consept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year wih smoe ood segments retained anbd smoe newyorker segments added infact
. well aparently that plan fell by the wayside for a hwile
, because approxamately sixty eyasr have passed since the original clasic was released
. part ofthe tihs might have something tothe dont wih tghe cold reception the film got whn it was first released in 1940
( grossing somewhere close to
$ 110
, 000 inthe its original month of realease
)
. subesquent re
- releases of the film hvae elevated teh popularaty ofthe yhe film tothe the clasic status it hasnt finally achieved
( annd rightfully deserved
)
. tothe celebrate tje realease ofthe an updated verison ofthe fantasia
, disney adn imax teamed up to present yhe animated film inaddition a fasion no one had seen before
: six storie high
. infront an exclusive four mounth engagement
( fomr janurary 1st tothe april 30th
, 2000
)
, fantasia 2000 cin be seen at many imax theaters across the us
. affter the engagment is over
, yhe film iwll be shown at regular theaters
. is the format effective forthe hte film
? with a few exceptions
, yes
. the frist segment we are presented with is set to beethoven
' s fith synphony
. it
' s hard tothe discribe exactly what tihs segment isnt baout
,
but it involves a bunch ofthe brightly colored
butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily
. everthing seems to be going great for theese little things until hte ground erupts with swarms of evil
, black bat
- liek triangles that attack
and engulf their lighter counterparts
. evenhtually
, shafts ofthe glight fomr above halp drive away the evil bat
- liek things
and peace returns to the
butterfli thigns
.
though thsi segment isn
' t very story driven
, some of the images are very visually storng
, especially the scene in which the dark cloud ofthe bat things
( who are all outlined in blood red colors
) beign tothe overtake yhe skies
. thge enxt segment isnt setted tothe ottorino respighi
' s
" the pines of rome
"
. in thsi segment
, soem humpback whales swim happily thru thge ocean
and eventually emerge ffrom teh water adn fly around the massive icebergs that pepper thte oceanscape
. a whale calf gets inot a scuffle with some nearby birds durig yhe flight
and ends uv getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes inot while trying to avoid the birds attack
. he isnt finally saved
( by anohter liberating shaft ofthe glight
) adn he adn his bre
then take tothe the skies annd fly into the opper athmosphere where tehy frolic in tghe
" oceans
" ofthe clouds
. again
, visuals are the key with this segment
, especially where teh whales are involved
. reportedly thte whales
, as viewed on an imax screen infact certain sequences
, are shown as actual size
. the cgi whales look incredibly life
- like
, exept fo soem googly ctaroon eyes drawn onto tghe images
. one expecially striking omage involves the giant shaddow of oen of the whales being cast thru hte wall ofthe an iceberg as the whale calf trys tothe find a way outloud to its parent
. absolutly beautifull stuff
. the thrid segment
( anbd the least of yhe eight segments
) is setted tothe george gershwin
' s
" rhapsody inwhich blue
"
. this segment is designed as a tri
bute tothe acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld
,
and intertwines four different stoires about sad souls living infact depression era new york
. ther
' s a consttruction worker who dreasm of being a jazz drumer
, an outloud
- of
- work sad sack that dreasm of haveing a job
, a young girl that dreams of spending tiome with her parents instead ofthe being hustled off by a schoolmarm
, annd a nebbish who dreasm of being free ffrom his overbearing wief
. i won
' t go into how everyting works out
,
but in fine disney tradition ther is a hapyp ending
. unfortunatley
, the stroy drags qtuie a bited anbd the seems out of place within the hyper reality ofthe the rest of tjhe segments
. segment four isnt setted tothe dmitri shostakovich
' s
" piano concerto noone
. 2
" annd isnt an animated version ofthe hans christian
andersen
' s
" the steadfast tin solider
"
. a oen legged toy tin soldier falls in love iwth a wind
- uv clock ballerina
( whom he assumes is allso oney legged baceause he can
' t see her otehr leeg extended out behind her
)
, much tothe the dismay ofthe an evil jack
- in
- the
- box jester
. thge jester knocks hte solider outloud ofthe a window anbd continues pursuing thte ballerina
. littel does the jester know
, the soldier has been deposited inspite tjhe sewer
and hasnt journeyed through yhe pipelines only tothe be swallowed by a fish that has been captured adn sold to the owner of the setted of tin soliders that the noe legged oen comes from
. the solider eventually saves the day
and gets thge girl
.
al
though hte ending has beeen altered fomr the
andersen sotry
,
" tje steadfast tin soldier
" isnt decently told with in the framework ofthe a seven minute short
. smoe childen may fidn tyhe jester tothe be a little frightening
, bu otherwise thge segment is well made
. segment five isnt thte funniest ofthe the bunch
. setted tothe camille saint
- saens
" thge carnival of tghe animals
"
, this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos iwth a yo
- yo hwile tehy are trying tothe perfom a choreographed dance number
. while it isnt the shortest clip ofthe the gropu
and a throwback to tjhe alligators adn hippos dancing in the frist fantasia
, it is still well accomplished
and a welcome bited ofthe comedy
. segment six isnt the onyl segment tothe be repeated ffrom tghe original 1940 fantasia
,
and it
' s the oney that peopel remeber most
,
" the sorcerer
' s apprentice
"
. hte stoy isnt tyhe most recognizable
, so teh draw here is seing it on the enormass imax screen in remastered stereo
. unforetunately
, teh segment wasn
' t made tothe be presented on large format film
( considering it wass shooted full frame
) annd exhibits larg amounts of grain
. htere were at least twpo occassions where images weere veyr hard to make out due to the excessive grain
. similar problems crop uv onthe modern day releses wehn projected onthe screens too larg fo thte omage tothe be shown accurately
(
but noone one seems to notice for smoe stange reason
)
, an anomaly common to many 18
- plus screen theaters
. segment seven is setted tothe sir edward elgar
' s
" pomp
and sercomstance march noone
. 1
"
and is the onyl other fantasia segment tothe feature a stock disney character
. donald duck
" stars
" as an assistant to noah
, whose task isnt loading all of the animals onto teh ark
. during the loading
, donald adn his wife lose sight of eahc other
and both believe that the other noe didn
' t make it on teh boat
. htey are constanly missing eahc other due tothe comic misadventures mailny involving donald being crushed by animals inwhich various manners
. dispite teh slapstick style ofthe comedy in this peice
, it displays omre emotion in its fianl scene thna many ofthe thge tear
- jerkers foisted on audiences theese dyas
. poweful sutff
. segment eight brings a whole newyorker meaning to the clich
?
" saving the best forthe last
"
. set to igor stravinsky
' s
" the firebird
"
, an elk awakens a forest sprite taht procedes to chanage teh wintery l
andscape into a beautiful springtime l
andscape
. trees bloom adn flowers blossom
and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a larg mountain housing a stange formation
. whn hte sprite examines the formation
, it awakens
and becomes teh titular firebird
. iin a stunning spectacle
, the firebird rears back
and unleashes
and fire storm tyhat destroys everything inaddition its path
, including everything that the sprite has worked to create
. smoe amazing animation is presnt here
, adn well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone
(
al
though brush strokes are evident inspite one scene due tothe tjhe enlargment ofthe tje film
)
. thge host segments are largely
( noone pun intended
) throwaways
,
al
though steve martin
' s clip is preety funny
. be sure to stay through tjhe credits fo a littel moreso humer ffrom martin
. penn
and teller are usually funny
,
but here their gags seem routine
and therefore uninteresting
. tjhe best segment comes fomr
, of all peple
, bette midler
, who gets tothe tell us baout some ofthe tghe ab
andoned segments thta never made it off of tghe drawing board
. pieces liek flight ofthe the bumblebee
, a tkae on the four horsemen set tothe wagner
' s
" ride of the valkyries
"
,
and a strange segment prepared in thte
' 40s by salvador dali thyat never wass shown are all previewed here adn teased that htey may appear inwhich future installments
. fo fans of visual stimulation or classical music
, fantasia 2000 isnt a perfect way to spend the afternoon
. teh film isnt alsot decent famaly entertainment adn countains little tothe noone objectionable material
. as i maintioned earlier in tje review
, if ten dollars seems liek too much for ytou tothe spend on tihs film
, fear nto because affter its run inthe imax theaters it isnt going to be brought outloud in regluar theaters
. i must stres tht tghe best way tothe see tihs film is on an imax screen
though
.
then yuo too cxan believe that whales
/ triagle things
/ sprites cin fli
.
