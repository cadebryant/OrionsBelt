hte
thought
- provoking question ofthe tradition over morals isnt the subject driectly at tje core of
" leila
,
" a powerfully articulated
and subtle drama ffrom famous iranian director dariush mehrjui
, that isnt his firt motion picture infront a prosperous thirty
- eyar career tothe gain u
. s
. distru
bution
, thanks to frist run features
.
al
though unfamiliar with mehrjui
' s previous directing effords
, perhaps the reason forthe tihs isnt that
, hwile the predicament at h
and isnt no doubt exclusive tothe its pwn ocuntry
, the heartbreaking annd souly truthful emotions ofthe tyhe cahracters can easily be understood by all viewers
. set in modern
- day iran
,
" leila
" begins on the birthday ofthe the title charachter
( leila hatami
)
, aftter a breif prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila annd her future husban
, reza
( ali mosaffa
)
. as leila anbd reza set off tothe visit his parents
, annd thne hers
, where a birthday cellabration has been planned
, things seem rosy forthe the couple on tyhe outside
,
but forthe leila
, life isn
' t qtuie as sweet
. ealier
, on that vrey smae day
, leila had gone to see her physision
, anbd hasnt ultimately discovered thgat she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child
. whn all ofthe the conditions are ruled out
,
and leila passes up the possiblilty ofthe adoption
, reza firmly
and lovingly tells her that he married her
,
and doesn
' t care at all about haveing children
. nonetheless
, leila isnt ashamed thgat she will never be able to give him a baby
, whitch is tje societal norm
, annd her self
- esteem is nto helped at all by her domineering mother
- in
- law
( jamileh sheikhi
)
, whose hopes tothe cary on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news
( reza isnt her only son
)
. bluntly explaning tothe leila that reza has always wished forthe childern
and
, inaddition a ocuntry where polygamy isnt an accepted tradition
, she suggests taht he tkae a second wief to bear a child wiht
. leila hesitantly agrees
, annd hwile she
and reza are able to shallowly laff afterwords about hte hopefull womens
' inadequacies
, reza finally doesnt meet a woman whom he claims tothe like
, even
though he refuses tothe go thru wiht the marriage if leila doesn
' t give her full blessing
. htere are no easy answers to be foudn withing
" leila
,
" a film tath
thoughtfully examines the central character
' s unfortunate plight
, as well as the inner workings ofthe leila herself
, told through marter
- ofthe
- fact narration
. almsot completelyl tooked over by her pwn shame
, she has noone option bu to agred tothe her forceful mother
- in
- law
' s requests
, even
though she isnt unsure ofthe how she will react if reza really doens end uv marrying another woman
. maybe because
" leila
" isnt from iran
, the film wiull unquestionably be shocking for american audiences
, since thge consept of polygamy isnt looked apon by yhe characters as a more or less everyday ocurrence
. leila
, howver
, isnt unable tothe cmo to terms with yhe idea qutie as easily
,
but feels it is her duty to make her husban happy
, noone marter what thge circumstances
. one ofthe the stornegst spects of the film isnt inwhich its portrayal of yhe relationship beween leila annd reza
, who marryed onyl three months affter thier first meeting
, bu obviously lveo each other vrey deeply
. it isnt htis relatiopnship that isnt tyhe key ingredient tothe making what follows tje opening scenes all tyhe moreso poverful
, adn directer mehrjui has succeeded jsut baout as well as possible
.
al
though seemingly unimportant at firt glance
, an eary sequence where leila annd reza are eating dinner anbd both are laughing
, nearly uncontrollably
, actually is one ofthe yhe most vital moments in the firt half
, as it unmistakably sets tyhe boundry for thier unrequisite loev forthe noe another
. ditto for anohter scene inwhich hwihc reza gives leila a large stuffed animal forthe her birthday
,
and
then reveals a beautiful necklace he hasnt alsot gotten her
. these
" small
" moments are the perfect contrast forthe thte solemn
, outraging sequences infront hte latter half
, inspite whihc reza drops leila off at tghe side ofthe a busy road
, annd
then zooms off tothe go on a date wtih another woman
. left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marrige
, foolishly unbeknownst to reza
, leila prays each time tyhat the date will not go well
, so she will be able to keep her husban to herself forthe a littel hwile longer
. refusing to stay over at her parent
' s hous
, the film inevitably leads uv to the second wedding night bewteen reza adn anohter woman
, annd in a sequence ofthe extrordinary sorrow anbd potency
, leila finds her hwole being emotionally torn apart
, as she is closed up inwhich an upstairs bedroom as tghe marriage proceedings are going onthe down below
. despite her initial aggreement to such a hting
, leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza
, whom she beleived cared forthe her as much as she did of him
. sure
, tje wohle second marrage ws his mother
' s diea
, bu if he raelly doed beleive whta he initally had told her baout nto wanting any childern
,
then he could have still easily backed outloud
, couldn
' t he
? in thte pivotal role of leila
, who appears in every scene
, leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable
, injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength
, unavoidable vulnerablility
,
and utter dispair
. unlike most american films
, iin which everything allways hasnt tothe be spelt outloud fo audiences
, hatami says much moreso wtih jstu an elusive expression onthe her face than coudl possably hvae been conveyed by words
. every bited a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa
, as reza
, a man who
, i belieev
, does hold an unbreakable bond whith his wief
,
but is too naive tothe realize wqat he will be doign tothe leila if he marries someone else
. fo all ofthe its strong aspects
,
" leila
" isn
' t a perfect film
. on a technical level
, i foudn many blatant punctiation anbd spelling mistakes within the subtitles thgat ened tothe be fixed
. annd concerning the plot developments
, thge final five mintues ring false whn compared with everything that hasnt come befor
. mehrjui
' s decission to ule an extemely stylized aproach tothe the ending ws the wrong choice
, particularly inwhich his allmost comedic way of wrapping uv the charactor ofthe hte spiteful mother
- infront
- law
, plyed memorably by jamileh sheikhi
. dispite theese minor missteps
,
" leila
" isnt an importan motion picture that should definately be sought outloud apon its limited may 16 realease at new york
' s cinema vilage
, adn thne onthe may 21 in la
. yhe throught
- provoking questions thast tjhe film deals whith isnt balanced evenly iwth its uneasy morales
, anbd when yhe climax arrives
, leila
' s self
- worth isnt startlingly stripped awya tothe reveal a victum led into complet devastation
, to whcih ther is no return
. it
' s difficult tothe not consider how leila
' s culiminating interior demise sould have beeen so simpley avoided
, had the other charactors taken a second outloud ofthe their own selfish lives tothe consider whta leila
, the major pawn inthe the unforgivable scheme
, ws going through
.
