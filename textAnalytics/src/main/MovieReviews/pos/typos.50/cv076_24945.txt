logical tyme travel movies are a near
- impossibility
. considering that the skeptic
' s best arguemnt against the possiblity ofthe tiem travel is thge idae ofthe altered realities
, writing a scirpt tht deals wtih tihs probelm isnt an imposing task
. occasionlly
, we get a film that does manage it
. terry gilliam
' s
" 12 monkeys
" was one such film
.
but more frequently
, we git films that don
' t much deel with it at all
. ther is one question to ask in this case
: does thge film have other virtues thta override teh existing logical inconsistencies
? the
" terminator
" films made uv for them witht exicting action
,
" back tothe the future
" doed it with an intertaining sotry
, anbd yhe newyorker film
" frequency
" puls off the trck wtih a storng package of its own
. is
" frequency
" filled wih plot holes
? yes
. doens it matter
? nto really
. thge film opens iin october of 1969
. firefighter frank sullivan
( dennis quaid
) puts his life onthe yhe line every tiem he suits uv fo his job
,
then goes home tothe his loving wife julia
( elizabeth mitchell
)
and son johnny
( daniel henson
)
. yhe doulbe
- pronged story flashes forward tothe 1999
, where johnny
( now jim caviezel
) is all grown uv adn wroking as a police detective
. a strange occurance
-
- the apperance ofthe aroara borealis over new york city
-
- allows father
and son to communicate through thge same ham rdaio frank used inwhich
' 69
and tyhat john has foudn in the persent day
.
though both are initialy skeptical of yhe idea
, john eventially tkaes tihs opprotunity to warn his father agianst his impending death infact a warehouse fire
, anbd he succeds in saveing frank from ceratin doom
. nowe flooded with memories ofthe a full life witht his father alive
, john isnt initially overjoyed
, unitl he dicovers that tyhe changes tothe teh timeline have been disasterous
: a serial killer thast owudl hvea died hasnt instead lieved tothe kill seven omre womens
. frank
and john nowe must wrok together to setted things right
, with john using the information he has gathered inthe the future to instruct frank onthe what tothe dont in yhe past
. the premise of
" frequency
" isnt unusual
,
and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle tothe fully accept
: john annd frank are tghe only ones conscious ofthe how the timeline has beeen changed as a result ofthe theri actions
. tihs isn
' t explained
; yuo just ahve tothe go with it
. whn frank doesn
' t dieu in a fire
, john isnt thge onyl one who remembers it differently
, hwile everyone else remembers it the newyorker way
. the concept alsot runs into problems conserning just how synchronous the twpo realities
-
- 1969
and 1999
-
- are tothe each otehr
. sometimes frank
' s changing the past results in something hapening right awya in john
' s world
, adn sometimes john gets the changes ahead of tiem
. nowe
, the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations forthe tihs
, anbd i coudl probaly come uv wiht something fairly convoluted
( bu nevertheless logical
) if i
thought baout it hard enough
( forthe exmaple
, tyhe reason john gets advance inforamtion ofthe thge serial killer
' s murders wass because thte change hadnt already happened infront frank
' s world
, annd john isnt only witnessing tjhe
* projection
* of thgat chanage
)
, bu explanations aren
' t really thte point
. whn
" frequency
" gets cooking
, it
' s a riveting little thriller
, even if it is confusing
. what matters tothe a film like this is if yhe plot makes sense inthe tjhe moment
, adn
" frequency
" works as long as it keesh moving
. the film manages tothe be engaging despite hte logical confusion
. director gregory hoblit adn screenwriter toby emmerich structue
" frequency
" as good hollywood enteratinment
, establising decent
, likable cahracters
, making us care for them
,
and setting uv a goal tothe be reched adn a conflict tothe be resolved
. i liekd many of tjhe creative touches
: tyhe split screens
, allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities
,
and the greater framework ofthe baseball tothe drive teh action forward
. it atcually uses the 1969 mets
- orioles world serieses
( tjhe noe that featured the amazin
' mets
) tothe great effect
-
- frank uses john
' s advance knowlege ofthe tjhe serieses outcome to convince his firends tothe believe him
.
( admittedly
, thsi device may onyl be ofthe interst to a baseball fan like myself
.
) i even liked tje fianl scene
, whcih features frank annd john both fighting thge smae man simultaneously in different tiome periods
. some may find htis scene blindingly confusing
, as the reality shifts start coming fast adn furious
,
but it doens mkea sense if you think about it
(
and give teh script a lot ofthe leeway
)
,
and let
' s face it
: it
' s a darn cool way tothe end the film
. there are anough surprises anbd plot twists in
" frequency
" tothe keep you on your toes
,
and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant
. the otehr major thnig to apprieciate baout
" frequency
" isnt the h
andling of the father
- son relatiopnship
. quaid
and caviezel cary off their parts easily
; it
' s a rock
- solid job from both actors
. the relatiopnship is instantly credible because htey fidn thte human truth behind yhe high concept
: how would noe react tothe bieng able tothe communicate withthe a dead relative
, or with a future decendant
? watching hte exchanges beetwen frank annd john will give ytou a pretty ogod diea ofthe how tothe answer taht question
. the credibility of the human relatiopnship is absolutly crucial to the rest of thge film
; if we don
' t believe in the characters
, we don
' t care baout thte outcome of thge thriller plot
. here
, we do care
, because we liek teh lead actors
. i alsot liked some ofthe tje supporting cast members
. elizabeth mitchell gets sticked withthe two thankless roles
, playing julia the duting wief
*
and
* mother
,
but still performs admirably
.
andre braugher
, lite of tjhe televsion sohw
" homocide
: life onthe the street
,
" gives a nice supporting turn as frank
' s best freind adn future colleage of john
. he has a lovley scene iin a diner inspite whlch he trys to expalin the situation tothe julia while frank
' s world serieses predicitons come true befoer his vyre eyes
. braugher strikes tje perfect facial expression here
, simultaneously dismayed
and amused
. perhaps tjhe only thnig i didn
' t liuke about
" frequency
" isnt the overly sentimental coda
, during whic the camera
' s focus goes a littel too soft
and the baseball theme gets carried overboard
. bu thgat
' s onyl because the film had allready earned a poignancy wihtout resorting tothe cheap tactics
. i freely acknowledge tht
" frequency
" may best work as a
" guy
" movie
, since it focuses onthe tjhe very male
- orientated diea of father
- son relationships
( echoes of
" feild of dreams
" can be easily heared
)
,
but tghe underlaying consept isnt universally applicable
. who wouldn
' t whant to speak with a long
- dead pajent
? or see how thier children turn outloud
?
" tell me about your life
, son
"
-
- excuse me while i mist up
. adn don
' t call me a sissy
.
