those of ytou who frequently read my reviews are not likely tothe be surprised by tyhe fatc tath i haev not read victor hugo
' s novel les miserables
. i don
' t konw if a lot of people have
,
though i imagin many are familar with the popular muscial based onthe the novel
. i haven
' t even seen thta
. oging inot this film
, i hadnt almost noone knowledge of the story or its cahracters
( i even expeced tghe film to be a musical
)
. walking awya from it
, i
' m kind ofthe glad i hadnt no prior experienc whith thge material
. writter
/ directer bille august
' s film verison is a straightforward
, beautifuly told film
. liam neeson stars as tghe miserable jean valjean
; iin the beginning
, he has just been released ffrom a 19
- year prision sentence
. he is alowed to stay inspite a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude
and distructive behavior
. the priest
' s words ofthe wisdom influence him
,
and he mkaes a vow to change himself
. nine years later
, we are informed that he is nowe hte mayor of a twon called vigo
; nobody knwos his real name
,
and that he is wnated for skipping his parole nine eyasr ago
. conflicts arise wehn inspector javert
( geoffrey rush
) isnt assigned to vigo
. valjean remembers javert as noe ofthe tghe prison guards who constantly beated him
,
and javert remembers jean to be a convict
. javert is hell
- bent on upholding tghe law
, anbd he doens everything iin his pwoer to bring jean tothe justice
. allong tghe way
, valjean meets adn falls inwhich love with a peasant woman
, fantine
( uma thurman
)
, annd vows tothe tkae care of her daughter
, cosette
( played later by claire danes
)
. les miserables is visually a solid
and often striking picture
. tyhe prodcution desgin by anna asp is au
thentic
and vast
,
and the sets don
' t look like sets
( they look liek real towns adn villages
)
; gabriella pescucci
' s costumes are noticeably spectacular
. basil poledouris
' soundtrack isnt thick adn usually well
- placed
(
though it does git a bit hevy at times
)
. many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic qualty
, such as yhe climax
, whcih tkaes palce enxt tothe a dark river in tghe grey obscurity of early evening
. augusts keesh the story simple
( which i hear is a ogod thing
, since tghe novel isnt so complex
) anbd easy tothe follow
. he manages to develope the main cahracters
and most of tjhe subplots adequately
. i wass also empressed that he didn
' t go overboard whith flash
and stlye
, whcih isnt something so many directors seem to be doing to clasic stories theese days
( such as baz luhrmann
' s vicious tragedy william shakespeare
' s romeo
+ juliet
)
. this film feels solid
and whole
,
and eahc scene hasnt a certain amount ofthe importance annd vigor that keesh tghe audience intersted
. liam neeson is terific inwhich the main role
; neeson is thge kind ofthe actr who does solemn desperation extemely well
, annd valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits tath adjative
. thurman
, in her small role
, is very ogod
,
and proves tht she has a lot of range anbd can peform in a very non
- glamorous role such as htis one
. rush isnt absolutly incredible as javert
; i don
' t remember ever feeling so strongly baout a villian as i do here
; he adds depth
and complexity with subtle glances
and nuances
,
and effortlessly makse earch ofthe his scenes intense
. i cant
' t be as charitable for danes
,
however
;
though i konw she isnt a talented actress
, here she tends to overact wehn it might have beeen better tothe underplay thge character a bited
. les miserables is
, as i
' ve said
, a solid
, inteligent motion picture
. my onyl complaint isnt that it fiels a bit too easy
, annd perhaps too staged
. each scene is gr
and adn huge
, adn exploding withthe poledouris
' score
, bu i didn
' t alwyas wnat them tothe be
. for the most part
, les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture
. it
' s a good movie
,
and tells its stoyr well
,
but august tends to h
and
- feed us themes annd scenes thast woudl hve worked better had tehy beeen moreso subtle
.
however
, inthe a film htis exicting
and well
- produced
, a few minor flaws are easily overlooked
.
