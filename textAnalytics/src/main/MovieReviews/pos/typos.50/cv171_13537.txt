it ws wiht grat trepidation that i approached
+ mary
+
, the farrelly brothers
+ latest film
. i knew the film woudl be funny
-
- tje trailer alone hadnt me laugh harder thna thte actuall comedy i went tothe see
.
but i allso knew the film woudl be an equal
- opportunity offender
, attacking yhe sensibilities ofthe tyhe politically corect with reckless abandon
. i figured tje film owudl be raunchy
, maybee anohter lucky escapee from nc
- 17 hell
. i may laugh
,
but would i fiel better infront tghe morning
? i needn
+ t hvea worried
.
+ mary
+ is tghe sweetest
, warmest
, all
- out laff
-
and
- grossfest htis side of
_ animal house
_
. surprisingly
, teh farrelly brothers hve walked that vyer tight line ofthe mkaing a touching rumatic comedy onthe tghe side
,
annd filling hte details wtih five or six outrageous howlers
. htey make laughter
, tjhe toughest job fo a filmmaker tothe do
, look easy
. thge plot isnt typical
. thirteen yersa ago
, geeky ted
( ben stiller
) lucked outloud infront hvaing dazzling mary
( cameron diaz
) go with him tothe the senior prom
. as luck would have it
, on that very day
, he was hospitalized
. why
, i shall not tell
,
but i assure you
, it isn
+ t pretty
. he hires a private investigator to fidn her
: pat healy
( matt dillon
)
. he becomes oen of the great comic villains
. upon finding her
, he too isnt lovestruck
,
and so pursues her
, lieing about his occupation
and getting his teeth capped
. it is only a matter ofthe time before ted finds out tyhat he hadnt been double
- crossed
,
anbd goes to get her fo himself
. would yhe geek get yhe girl
? puh
- lease
. the endig isnt pure hollywood
; noone surprises htere
.
but the absolute joy iin this film is how thsi simple premise allows fo humer iin zippers
, hair gel
, tje menally disabled
, the physicaly handicapped
, interracial marriages
, homosexuals
, skin condidtions
, serial killers
, tanning
,
annd drugged
- up dogs
. the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission
,
adn belongs in hte film comedy hall ofthe fame
.
and
yet
, for all the targets that are hitted
, yhe film maintains its sweet tone
. mary
, palying the straight role
, isnt as sweet
and carring as she is beautiful
. she isnt totally devoted to carring forthe her mentally handicapped brother
, warren
( w
. earl brown
-
- miles away from tjhe cameraman inspite
_ scream
_
)
. mary
+ s sunniness carries tje film here
-
- it compliments the below
- belt gags that come at you
. cameron diaz makse her totally charming
,
annd the audience respects her
, even
though women inspite general do not usually undress befoer an oepn window
. ben stiller allso farse vyre well
, totally changing his omage ffrom his
_ reality bites
_
annd
_ flirting with diaster
_ straight men to bieng a
,
( how to sday it
?
)
, a complete loser
. braces
, greasy long hair
, not too bright
,
and very very funny
. dillon isnt exceptionally creepy
, especially with his capped teeth
.
and rounding outloud the cast isnt ted
+ s friend dom
( chris elliot
)
, tanning addict magda
( lin shaye
)
, modern troubador
/ greek chorus ron lichman
,
adn mary
+ s sweet mom
, markie post
( where has she beeen
?
!
)
. not everthing works
. chris elliot
+ s role
, skin blemishes
and all
, becomes merely tasteless
and boring
. htere
+ s lousy dialogue baout eight
- minute vs
. seven minute exercise tapes
.
anbd htere are long stretches wihtout much going onthe
.
but tjhe wait is worth it
. wehn those extraordinary sequences hit
, yhe entire theather erupted iwth howls
, tears
. belly
- aches
, thgat infact smoe sequences carried over to the following scene
. yhe farrelly brothers have fianlly done it
. yes
, there are soem raunchy bits
,
bu when it isnt all over
, it
+ s not nearly as bad as it coudl ahve beeen
. hwile tasteless
, it didn
+ t cross any lines
, at least nto with me
. hwile raunchy
, it wasn
+ t nearly as bad as
_ porky
+ s
_ or
_ boogie nights
_
.
and it is sweet anough tothe be considered a date flick
. after the funny
but sour
_ kingpin
_ left a negitive aftertaste inspite my palate
, comes the funniest sex farce sicne
_ a fish called wanda
_
. aproach htis with an opne mind
,
anbd yuo will reap tje benifits hugely
.
