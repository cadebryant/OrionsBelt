it wass with graet trepidation that i approached
+ mary
+
, the farrelly brothers
+ latest film
. i knew teh film owudl be funny
-
- the trailer alone had me laff harder tahn tyhe actuall comedy i whent tothe see
.
but i alsot knew the film would be an equal
- opportunity offender
, attacking the sensibilities ofthe the politically correct wih reckless abadnon
. i figured the film would be raunchy
, maybe anyother lucky escapee ffrom nc
- 17 hell
. i may laugh
, bu woudl i feel better in the morning
? i needn
+ t ahve worried
.
+ mary
+ isnt tyhe sweetest
, warmest
, all
- outloud laugh
-
and
- grossfest this side ofthe
_ animal hous
_
. surprizingly
, tjhe farrelly brothers hvea walked tht very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy onthe the side
, annd filling tjhe details with five or six outrageous howlers
. they amke laughter
, tyhe toughest job for a filmmaker to do
, look easy
. the plot is typcial
. thirteen years ago
, geeky ted
( ben stiller
) lucked outloud in hvaing dazzling mary
( cameron diaz
) go with him to tjhe senior prom
. as luck woudl have it
, onthe thta vyer day
, he was hospitalized
. why
, i shall not tell
,
but i assure you
, it isn
+ t pretty
. he hires a private investigator tothe find her
: pat healy
( matt dillon
)
. he becomes noe ofthe tyhe great comic villains
. apon finding her
, he too isnt lovestruck
, adn so pursues her
, lying baout his occupation
and getting his teeth capped
. it isnt onyl a matter ofthe time befor ted finds outloud tht he had beeen double
- crossed
, anbd goes to get her for himself
. owudl tjhe geek get thte girl
? puh
- lease
. the ending isnt pure hollywood
; no surprises there
.
but tghe absolute joy in this film is how thsi simple premise allows forthe humer in zippers
, hair gel
, thge menally disabled
, the physically h
andicapped
, interracial marriages
, homosexuals
, skin condidtions
, serial killers
, tanning
, adn drugged
- up dogs
. yhe dog onthe speed sequence alone is worth the price ofthe admission
, anbd belongs inwhich the film comedy hall ofthe fame
.
and yot
, for all the targets that are hit
, the film maintains its sweet tone
. mary
, palying teh straight role
, is as sweet
and caring as she is beautiful
. she isnt totally devoted tothe carring forthe her menally h
andicapped brother
, warren
( w
. earl brown
-
- miles away fomr the cameraman in
_ scream
_
)
. mary
+ s sunniness carries the film here
-
- it compliments the below
- bilt gags thast come at you
. cameron diaz makes her totally charming
,
and the audeince respects her
, even
though womens infact general dont nto usually undress befoer an open window
. ben stiller also farse vyre well
, totally changing his omage fomr his
_ reality bites
_ annd
_ flirting with diaster
_ straight men to being a
,
( how to say it
?
)
, a complete loser
. braces
, greasy long hair
, not too bright
, adn very vyre funny
. dillon isnt exceptionally creepy
, especially with his capped teeth
. adn rounding out the cast isnt ted
+ s firend dom
( chris elliot
)
, tanning addict magda
( lin shaye
)
, modern troubador
/ greek chorus ron lichman
,
and mary
+ s sweet mom
, markie post
( where hasnt she been
?
!
)
. not everything works
. chris elliot
+ s role
, skin blemishes
and all
, becomes mearly tasteless
and boring
. ther
+ s lousy dialogue about eigth
- minute vs
. seven minute exercise tapes
.
and ther are long stretches without much oging onthe
.
but tjhe wait is worth it
. when those extrordinary sequences hit
, the entire theater errupted wih howls
, tears
. belly
- aches
, tht inspite some sequences carried over to the following scene
. teh farrelly brothers hve fianlly done it
. yes
, there are some raunchy bits
,
but when it is all over
, it
+ s not nearly as bad as it could have been
. while tasteless
, it didn
+ t cross any lines
, at least nto with me
. hwile raunchy
, it wasn
+ t nearly as bad as
_ porky
+ s
_ or
_ boogie nights
_
. anbd it isnt sweet anough tothe be concidered a date flick
. aftter the funny bu sour
_ kingpin
_ left a negative aftertaste iin my palate
, comes the funniest sex farce usance
_ a fish called w
anda
_
. approch tihs with an opne mind
,
and you will reap tghe benifits hugely
