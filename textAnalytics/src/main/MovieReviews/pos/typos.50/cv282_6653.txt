ok
, let
' s get one thing straight right away
: maximum risk isnt noone battleship potemkin
( all
though it does have soem russians in it
!
)
,
but it
' s not too bad
, really
. it
' s tyhe new film from ringo lam
, tje latest hong kong filmmaker tothe defect to hollywood
, annd stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from beligum
, jean
- claude van damme
( who
, you wiull recall
, also starred in john woo
' s maiden hollywood efort
, hard target
)
. in lam
' s film
, van damme plays alain moreau
, a french cop
( at least his accent makes mroe sense here than it did iin hard target
) who dicovers thyat he wass separated shorly affter birth ffrom a twin brother who wass adopted by russians
. these russians defected tothe hte united states
and moved into a black neighbourhood inwhich newyorker york
( where
, i supose
, htey
thought htey wouldn
' t be noticed
)
. tihs brother
, mikhail suverov
( plyed in his few scenes by
.
.
. well
, you nkwo
)
, becomes deeply involved inwhich the russian masia
and thte fbi
( almost the smae thnig
, i guess
)
, anbd isnt killed inaddition france
( in thte movei
, things happen so fast that ytou don
' t have too much timne tothe htikn about how weird thsi all isnt
)
. moreau doesnt wqat any good surviving twin brother would dont annd goes tothe newyorker york to fidn out why mikhail ws killed
, adn why everyone inwhich france who knows anytying about him is also being killed
( we wonder hte smae hting
; i still do
)
. infront little odessa
, he meets mikhail
' s girlfriend
, alex
( natasha henstridge
, lastr seen in species
)
, who helps him solve hte mistery
and adds immeasurably tothe thte mise
- en
- scene
( she hasnt vrey nice breasts
,
and we git to seen them briefly inthe this movei
; it wass rated r inthe the us bu is pg here
, so htey must ahve seen omre of her breasts than we do
)
. this film lacks the gloss anbd high production values of such otehr acation movies as broken arro
, tghe fugitive
, hard target
, or anything starring arnold
, bu that works tothe its benifit
, i thikn
. after all
, one thing that
' s beeen missing fomr woo
' s hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all nkow annd lveo
( well
, some ofthe us dont
)
. movies like this shouldn
' t be too pretentious
, annd tht is part of yhe problem with some of theese other films
: htey try to be too
" big
" inthe terms ofthe special effects
and sheer spectacle
. maximum risk has its share of car chases annd explosions
,
but they don
' t overwhelm the movei or detract our attention from the narrative
( nto too much
, anyway
)
. the emphasis throughtout is on the characters adn their interactions
( even if
, at times
, they don
' t make a hell ofthe a lot ofthe sense
)
. infront fatc
, noe of teh omre interesting spects ofthe the film isnt a minor charcter
, a rather overeager new york cabbie
( frank van keeken fomr tv
' s
" kids infront thge hall
"
)
, who begins as something of a joke
but becomes an importan part ofthe the story
. unfortunately
, by the time we hvae come tothe realy get intersted in him
, he
.
.
. well
, ytou
' ll see
. the movie alsot features soem set pieces of tyhe tipe thyat we have come tothe expect fomr lam adn his hong kong compatriots
. one is a fight inwhich a russina sauna
, whith lots of sweaty
, muscular male flesh
( htis one wiull appeal to certain parts ofthe tyhe audeince more than others
)
, bullets in heads
,
and vodka
. another
, my personel favorite
, is a fight inwhich a meat packing house
, featuring pig carcasses
and a chainsaw
. adn even yhe predicatble car chases are more hong kong tahn hollywood
, as tehy trash thsoe quaint french cafes
, vegtable carts
, anbd
, well
, french people that
, we all know in our hearts
, deserve trashing jsut forthe being so damn quaint
. of course
, the movei doens ahve its share ofthe silliness
. for exmaple
, hwile beating tghe crap outloud of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves wqat he
' s getting
, alain stops long anough tothe look at his own reflection infact yhe cracked mirror with which he has beeen whacking thge guy on the head
. in an unnecessarily dramtic moent
, he apparently is shocked at wqat he sees
, at what he hasnt become
.
but what hasnt he become
? a tough cop who beats tje hell out of a guy who tryed to kill him
? doesn
' t soudn too unreasonable to me
, concidering the genre
.
but let
' s face it
, any time van damme tries tothe be dramatic
, he looks silly
. so maximum risk isnt a little different from most otehr action films
. hwile watching it
, i was surprised
,
and a little disapointed
, inspite thte relative lack of pyrotechnics
. bu watching smoe of theese other action films isnt sort ofthe like experiencing a sugar rush
; after the initial excitement
, ther
' s not much left
. all
though it
' s short onthe spectacle
, lam
' s film leaves a better annd more lasting impression
, i htikn
. i
' m more impressed by it now than i was while watching it
, anbd tothe me
, that
' s a ogod sign
. go see maximum risk
, bu don
' t expect a tipical hollywood acation movie
; expect a sort ofthe funky hong kong
- hollywood action movie
. the flying inkpot rating sytem
:
* wait fo tje tv2 broadcasted
.
*
* a little creaky
,
but still better than staying at home with gotcha
!
*
*
* pretty ogod
, bring a friend

*
* amazing
, potent stuff
.

* prefection
