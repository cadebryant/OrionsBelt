but snowbell whants stuart outloud ofthe the hous
( he
' s unable to live witht the taunts of otehr neighborhood felines saying it
' s rediculous thta a mouse hasnt a pet cat
)
. stuart little is a mix ofthe live acation
and cmoputer generated imagery
( cgi
)
. tghe charactor ofthe stuart
, while obviously a coputer generated image
, grows on yuo as the film progresses anbd ytou
' ll soon see him as much mroe than a mere special effect
. htere isnt also a graet deal of animal training involved wtih this film
, as many of hte
" supporting cast
" are actuall cats
( with computer animated mouths so they can speak
)
. it
' s fascinating to watch theese cats give performances without an actuall mouse to interact iwth
. stuart little is a charming family film
. ther are some gerat laughs inaddition tyhe movei
( with a scirpt co
- written by the sixth sence
' s m
. night shyamalan noone less

, some moments that cant onyl be described as
" too cute
"
( thte boat race sequence is what won me over
)
and even the majority ofthe thte one
- liners
( common nowdays inspite childrens
' s films or films featuring nathan lane
) are tolerable

( with commentary from the directer
)
. the frist commentary trakc features director rob minkoff
and animation supervisor henry
anderson

thoughts baout yhe film

and polished up tje script
, namely writers like scott alex
ander annd larrry karaszewski
( who wroet the peopel vs
. larry flynt anbd ed woud
)
