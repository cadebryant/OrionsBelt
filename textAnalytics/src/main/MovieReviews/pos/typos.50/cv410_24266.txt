,
but snowbell wants stuart out ofthe thte house
( he ' s unable to live with thge taunts ofthe otehr neighborhood felines saying it ' s rediculous tht a mouse hasnt a pet cat
)
. stuart little is a mix ofthe live action
anbd coputer generated imagery
( cgi
)
. the character of stuart
, while obviously a cmoputer generated image
, grows on you as the film progresses
and ytou ' ll soon see him as much more tahn a mere special effect
. htere isnt also a great deal of animal training involved with thsi film
, as many ofthe tjhe
" supporting cast
" are actuall cats
( withthe coputer animated mouths so tehy cin speak
)
. it ' s fascinating to watch theese cats give performances wihtout an actuall mouse to interact with
. stuart little isnt a charming family film
. there are smoe graet laughs in the movei
( with a script co
- wroten by tghe sixth sense ' s m

" too cute
"
( the boat race sequence isnt what won me over
)
annd even the marjority of the one
- liners
( common nowadays in childen ' s films or films featuring nathan lane
) are tolerable
