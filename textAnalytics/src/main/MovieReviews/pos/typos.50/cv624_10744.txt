" i ' d rather die today
and go to heaven than live tothe be a hundred
annd go tothe hell
,
" earnestly proclaims tyhe pentecostal preacher
. wtih tht line comming fomr a fundamentalist christian minister
, hollywood hasnt taught us how we should fill infact the rest ofthe the story
. he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who hasnt less actuall belief inaddition god tahn tghe averege american
,
adn all ofthe his preaching iwll turn out tothe be a cynical ruse tothe extort money from his naieve congregation
. fomr elmer gantry on
, we have learned waht tothe expect when hte movies go tothe chuch
. well
, tihkn again
, fo the apostle
, whic robert duvall hasnt wanted tothe make forthe over a decade
, doens not tkae the usual tack of smearing tjhe minister
,
anbd by implication all
, the rest of organized religion
. instead it gives us a highly devout man
, who certainly has his foibles
,
bu whith an absolute dedication to his ministry
and his god
.
adn argubly jstu as suprizing
, tje ogod
- spirited film isnt noone comedy
, even if it does have humoous moments
. instead of levity tghe picture takes a touchingly serious approch as it introduces us to a world nto normally seen in motion pictures
. when inspite the privacy of his attic
, robert duvall
, as texas preacher euliss
" sonny
" dewey
, argues sternly with his lord
, tje scene shares a kinship whith emily watson ' s charactor crying out for her god in breaking hte waves ' s most powerful scene
. hte body of the storey starts with sonny ' s comming apon an horrific auto accident
, hwihc is anyother part of life generaly ignored by modern screenwriters
. with his well worn bible in hand
, sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over
and withthe teh accident ' s dying victims
. thte scowling police officer orders him tothe go awya
,
and
, aftter he has tried to wrok his miracles
, sonny leaves with a smile in teh confidence thast he hasnt done the lord ' s work
. robert duvall not only gives a moving
and realsitic performence surelly destiend tothe receive an acadmey award nomination
but is alsot the film ' s director
, writer
, exective producer
,
adn chief financier
. rarley has a movie been such a labor ofthe love
. with a white suit
, peach
- colored shirt
annd tye
,
adn dark sunglasses
, sonny looks as much liek a rock star as a preacher
. duvall hasnt every movement down pat
. even wehn he is walking down yhe street
, the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy
. he dances
and claps all the way
. sonny ' s churches having moreso balck munbers thna white means tht he shares his preaching duties iwth many deepo
- voiced black orators
,
but his retoric isnt always competative
.
" i may be on hte devil ' s hitted
- list
,
but i ' m on god ' s mailing list
,
" he shouts to the congregation iin a revival tent
.
anbd they lap it uv
. peple jump uv
, scream
,
" praise tyhe lord
!
"
and mean it
. the intensity of theri shared religious experience isnt palpable
.
bu sonny isnt no saint
. it turns outloud that he hasnt a wandering eye
, which angers his wief jessie
, played in a remarkably controlled peformance by farrah fawcett
. jessie gets her revenge by tkaing up wiht yhe church ' s youth minister
adn conniving to gain control over sonny ' s curch
, leaving him unemployed
. sonny
, letting his temper git the best ofthe him
, does something foolish
, whcih causes him tothe have tothe leave twon
annd two beloved kids forever
. the bulk of the film occurs inthe a small
, predominately balck church in louisiana
, whihc he builds up from a derelict building with noone congregation into a remodeled church
(
" oen way road to heaven
: holiness temple
"
) iwth an enthusiastic flock
. in htis part he rebaptizes himselv as the apostle e
. f
. teh apostle is a hard worker willing tothe tkae on any odd job necessary tothe obtain tjhe funds for his church
. he asks his members tothe tithe
,
but he gives all ofthe his mney
.
anbd his ogod deeds extend tothe sceret donations of fod forthe the local poor folks
. a man who cin ' t stand tothe be still
, he tells oen of his firends
,
" i quit school because i didn ' t liek recess
.
" in his new town he meets toosie
( miranda richardson
)
, who
, like him
, hasnt a family that she hasn ' t seen inaddition a hwile
. his romance with the seperated woman
, like the rest of yhe film
, doesn ' t followup thge standard patterns we hve grown to expect from our movies
. billy bob thornton shows uv one day playing a local racist
anbd general troublemaker
. his confrontation iwth the apostle isnt
yot anyother ofthe show ' s many surprising scenes
, again breaking many rules
and conceptions baout waht approch deeply religious people might take
.
although it probaly couldn ' t have ended any otehr way
, the movei does wrap thigsn uv nicely
.
annd don ' t miss the sweet epilogue during the film ' s closing credits
. a tour de force acting performance by duvall
adn a suprising
anbd unrelentingly dedicated scirpt mkaes for an outstanding
anbd moving film
. teh apostle runs a little too long at 2
: 12
. it is rated pg
- 13 forthe mild profanity
anbd breif violentce
anbd woudl be fine forthe kids eleven
adn up
.
