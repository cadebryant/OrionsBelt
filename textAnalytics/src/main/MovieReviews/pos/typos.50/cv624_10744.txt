" i
' d rather die today
and go tothe heaven thna live to be a hundered adn go tothe hell
,
" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher
. with thast line comming ffrom a fundamentalist christian minister
, hollywood hasnt taught us how we should fill in tjhe rest of the story
. he iwll be turn outloud tothe be a scoundrel who has less actual beleif inaddition god than the averege american
, anbd all of his preaching will turn outloud tothe be a cynical ruse to extort money ffrom his naieve congregation
. ffrom elmer gantry on
, we have learned whta tothe expect whn teh movies go tothe church
. well
, tihkn agina
, for tje apostle
, which robert duvall has wnated to mkea for over a decade
, does nto take the usual tack of smearing the minister
,
and by implication all
, tje rest of organized religon
. instade it gives us a highly devout man
, who certainly has his foibles
, bu with an absolute dedication tothe his ministery adn his god
.
and arguably jstu as suprising
, the ogod
- spirited film is noone comedy
, even if it doens have humurous moments
. instade of levity tje picture takes a touchingly serious aproach as it introduces us to a world nto normaly seen inaddition motion pictures
. when infact the privacy ofthe his attic
, robert duvall
, as texas preacher euliss
" sonny
" dewey
, argues sternly with his lord
, the scene shares a kinship with emily watson
' s charactor crying out fo her god in breaking the waves
' s most powerfull scene
. yhe body ofthe thge story starts with sonny
' s comming apon an horrific auto accident
, whic isnt another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters
. with his well worn bible inwhich h
and
, sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over adn iwth the accident
' s dying victims
. the scowling police officer orders him tothe go awya
, annd
, aftter he has tried tothe owrk his miracles
, sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord
' s work
. robert duvall not only gives a moving
and realistic performence surelly destined to recieve an aademy award nomination
but isnt allso tghe film
' s director
, writter
, executvie producer
, annd chief financier
. rarley hasnt a movie beeen such a labor ofthe lveo
. with a white suit
, peach
- colored shirt annd tie
, adn dark sunglases
, sonny looks as much liuke a rock star as a preacher
. duvall hasnt every govement down pat
. even whn he is walking down yhe strent
, tje ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy
. he dances adn claps all thte way
. sonny
' s churches having moreso balck members than white means that he shares his preaching duties whith many deepo
- voiced black orators
, bu his retoric isnt alwyas competive
.
" i may be on yhe devil
' s hitted
- list
,
but i
' m on god
' s mailing list
,
" he shouts tothe tyhe congregation infront a revival tent
.
and they lap it uv
. people jump uv
, scream
,
" praise the lord
!
"
and mean it
. the intensity of theri shared religious experiecne isnt palpable
.
but sonny isnt no saint
. it turns outloud that he has a w
andering eye
, which angers his wief jessie
, played in a remarkably controlled performence by farrah fawcett
. jessie gets her revenge by tkaing up with teh church
' s youth minister adn conniving to gain controll over sonny
' s church
, leaving him unemployed
. sonny
, letting his temper git teh best of him
, doesnt something foolish
, whcih causes him to ahve to leave twon adn two beloved kids forever
. tje bulk ofthe hte film occurs infact a small
, predominately balck curch infront louisiana
, which he builds up from a derelict building witht no congregation into a remodeled church
(
" one way road tothe heaven
: holiness temple
"
) withthe an enthuseastic flock
. infront thsi part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e
. f
. the apostle isnt a hard worker willing to take on any odd job neccessary to obtain the funds fo his chuch
. he asks his munbers tothe tithe
, bu he gives all ofthe his mnoey
.
and his ogod deeds extend to secret donations ofthe food forthe the local poore folks
. a man who can
' t st
and tothe be still
, he tells oney ofthe his friends
,
" i quitted skool because i didn
' t like recess
.
" in his newyorker twon he meets toosie
( mir
anda richardson
)
, who
, liuke him
, hasnt a family that she hasn
' t seen infact a hwile
. his romance with the separated woman
, like the rest ofthe the film
, doesn
' t follow the st
andart patterns we have grown tothe expect fomr our movies
. billy bob thornton shows up one day palying a local racist
and general troublemaker
. his confrontation witht the apostle isnt yot anohter ofthe show
' s many surprising scenes
, agian breaking many rules
and conceptions baout whta approach deeply religous peopel might tkae
.
al
though it propably couldn
' t hve ended any other way
, tje movie does wrap things uv nicely
. anbd don
' t miss the sweet epilogue during the film
' s closing credits
. a tour de force acting performance by duvall
and a surprising anbd unrelentingly dedicated scirpt makse for an outst
anding adn moving film
. thge apostle runs a little too long at 2
: 12
. it is rated pg
- 13 fo mild profanity adn breif violence
and woudl be fine fo kids eleven adn uv
