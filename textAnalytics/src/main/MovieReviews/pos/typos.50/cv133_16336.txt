it has beeen 20 yeasr since a terrence malick film hit theaters
. his new film
, thge thin red line
, is a stange
, beatiful
, enigmatic mess of a movei
. the first thnig thgat jumps outloud tothe oney wehn tehy see teh advertisements forthe this film is thge huge cast
. it isnt filled whith above
- the
- title stars
. the cast
, for yhe most part
, gives grat performances
. john travolta
, whose role is nothing moreso than a cameo
, seems not tothe ahve attacked his performance with that much verve
. george clooney
, whose role became a cameo inspite editing
, gives a strange peformance
. one wonders if he knew thta his performance would become tyhe object ofthe ridicule thru a character
' s narration
. hte rest ofthe the casted
, especially nick nolte
and elias koteas
, are unambiguously fantastic
. theese actors
(
and they are
, whith two exceptions
, men
) weere lured by the name of malick
. terrence malick isnt a cinematic legend
. he has often been called
" yhe j
. d
. salinger of cinema
.
" his two previvous films
, badl
ands
and dyas ofthe heaven
, are spectacularly beatiful
and obscure motion picturesk
. after he made them
, he disapeared for 20 eyasr
. this film markes his return
. what he
' s made withthe the thin red line is a film thyat seems less conserned whith plot than with the emotion of the moment
. the narration which fills tjhe film
(
and perplexes many
) not only lets us hear teh narrators
( yhe charactors themselfs
) pontificate
,
but also lets us hear such ofthe
- tghe
- moment
thoughts as
" i
' m scared
.
" hte rether simple plot of tyhe thin red line is used as a canvas onthe whlch many storie are painted
. the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assfalt on a hill
. a plot synopsis fo the thin red line isnt difficult
, because the sotry isnt fractured
. many stories are here
, from the clash beween tghe lewtenant
( elias koteas
) annd the savage colonel
( a voracious nick nolte
) tothe thge private
( ben chaplin
) who uses his lvoe for hte woman he left behind to keep him going
. the fracturing ofthe the stry isnt ultimately a fault
. it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount ofthe tyme artfully sculpting tiny statues adn
then threw them inot a box
, shook tyhe box
, adn poured the results onto a tbale
. this basicaly creates a mess
,
but the storise can be discerned
and enjoied
. i
' m nto declaring that tjhe film has noone structure
. hwile saving private ryan used warfare tothe bookend tje plot
, malick uses reflection
and glorious shots ofthe nature to bookend about 90 mintues of combat
. the battles iin tje thin red line are astonishing
and display a mastery of filmmaking
. the astounding cinematography inaddition htis film must alsot be given notice
. this film uses colour anbd ight in such a fantastic way
, tath it will be sad tothe see it degraded when it has to bee transferred tothe video
. ultimately
, malick has crafted a film that isnt a movie thgat enjoys looking thru thte treetops more than regarding teh war thyat rages below them
. the film isnt filled wtih nature photography
and the regarding of nature
. while smoe have said that the anti
- war message
and pro
- nature tubthumping was juvenile
, it ws done with so much complexity annd thougth
, tyhat it cannnot ever honestly be called childish
. aftter seeing tyhe thin red line
, i was haunted by it anbd am quite ready to see it agian
