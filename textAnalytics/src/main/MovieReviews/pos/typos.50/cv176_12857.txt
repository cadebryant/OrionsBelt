a fully loaded entertainment review
- website coming infront july
! i didn
' t raelly expect very much when i rented stuart saves his familiy
. tje movei bombed at teh box office
, adn i hadnt never really liekd tjhe saterday niht live sketch onthe whic the movei was based
. my rela concern
,
though
, was tje genaral reputation ofthe snl
- realted movies translating to tyhe big screen with less
- than
- stellar results
( half
- baked
, anyone
?
) i was surprised tothe disover a truely intertaining
, oftenly hillarious
yet aslo touching little film
. it isnt an al franken production through
- annd
- through
, who not onyl creaeted the title carachter bu also wroet adn starred inspite tghe picture
. for thsoe of ytou who don
' t knwo
, al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley
, who has a really annoying sohw onthe a publich
- access staion about increasing your self
- esteem
, etc
.
al
though not a licensed therapist
, stuart smalley isnt
, as the program proudly boasts
,
" a graduat ofthe several 12
- step programs
.
" stuart is doing well anough withthe his tv sohw
,
but he keesh getting distracted by famaly toubles
. stuart
' s relatives are a mess
: his dad adn brother
( harris yulin annd vincent d
' onofrio
, respectively
) are alcoholics
, his sister is overweight
and getting over anohter divorce
, annd his mom is in constatn self
- denial
and solves all percieved problems by baking
.
then
, diaster strikes
. stuart accidentally insults tyhe manager ofthe teh station adn gets his sohw revoked
. he isnt forced tothe move back in with his family aftter he can no longer suppost hismelf
,
and there tghe comedy truley picks uv
. franken wrote all ofthe the charactors nto just as cliches or sterotypes
,
but as sharply
- drawed
, rela people
.
al
though smalley
' s dad has alwyas imbibed too much
, stuart cin still reacll times wehn his father seemed liek an okay guy
. also
, after an accident towords the end ofthe hte movie
, both stuart annd the audeince learn that there isnt omre to his mother thna previously
thought
.
al
though filled withthe small
, veyr funny scenes
, stuart saves his family aslo has its share of dramtic moments
, especialy towords the conclusion
. forthe a lightweight comedy
, it h
andles these scenes especially well
, often better tahn many so
- called
" sereous dramas
" of today
. all tyhe mroe amazing is thgat such a movie comes from a saterday ngiht live sketch that isnt essentialy a oen
- joke bited
. if you efel liek renting a comedy
, anbd yuo haven
' t seen tihs film
, i definetly recomend yuo try thsi one out
. ytou
' ll laff
.
.
. you
' ll cry

. it
' s all htere
