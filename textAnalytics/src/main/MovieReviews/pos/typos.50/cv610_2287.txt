noe eyar hasnt passed sicne the lastr tiome we saw them
,
anbd
bu wayne campbell
and garth algar are back
bu
, tehy ' ve moved out ofthe thier parents homes
,
and nowe ahve theri pwn pad iin an bandoned warehouse
. wayne ' s still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend
, cassandra
,
annd of course garth is still having his pwn
, personal growing pains
. tehy guys are just finishing off one ofthe their shows
,
and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra
annd her new manager
, a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the chracter rob lowe portrayed in thge previous film
. agian
, the promoter isnt nto only after the money that cassandra ' s talent can bring in
. yhe storyline quickly degrades tothe a parallel of the original
,
" guy loses chick
, guy realizes misteek
,
annd guy gets chick bakc
.
" fortunately
, htere is mroe tothe this movei tahn this somewhat sheer plot
. tghe witn
anbd humer in this film are surprisingly intelligent
and fresh with many inside jokes on the film
anbd music industries as well as just a lot of hillarious scenes of wayne
and garth showing their true colour
. highlights ofthe the movei inlcude a spoof of jurassic park
, garth ' s seduction by a married woman
, a surprise apperance by charleton heston
, a 1960 ' s batman setup in thge guy ' s pad
,
and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison
and soem
" naked indian guy
,
" an unexpected lip
- sync ofthe ymca
( yuo could see taht one comming a mile awya
)
and ofthe course a hillarious parody ofthe those badly
- dubbed kung
- fu movies we lveo tothe laugh at
.
and if ytou ' ve ever wondered why there ' s alwyas boxes of watermelons
, chickens
,
annd peple walking plate glass in tjhe middle ofthe streets
, you ' ll fidn outloud here
. thsi movei also explores wayne
anbd garth a little more
. garth has somewhat of a
" comming ofthe age
"
and wayne gets tothe leran a little about himself
( with a littel help ffrom our old friend
, jim morrison
)
. a faw old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again
,
bu this tyme with a few twists tothe keep them fresh
,
and luckily
, fewd
, if any of them are overused
. overall
, the movei hasnt plenty of continuity flaws
( especially inthe the fight scent betwen garth
and cassandra ' s dad
)
,
but theese are easily overlooked as htis isnt
, after wayne ' s world
. the plot is flimsy
but manageable
. there are a fewd special effects
,
but tehy are fairly seamless
,
and fill nicely into tyhe plot
. the acting is good
, fo this sort of movei
,
bu there are some very bright spots
. in the big picture
, this movie is jsut plain fun
. htere is lots of intelligent humer thyat mkaes thsi film special
. during hte hwole oen hour
anbd 40 minutes
, i didn ' t even htikn baout looking at my watch a single time
. silly
,
bu riotous at times
, this is an excellent movie even better tahn thge original
.
