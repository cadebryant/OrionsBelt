one yera has pasted usance the lastest time we saw them
,
and
but wayne campbell annd garth algar are bakc bu
, htey
' ve moved outloud of their parents homes
,
and nowe have their pwn pad inwhich an ab
andnoed warehouse
. wayne
' s still hopelessly infatuated wtih his girlfriend
, cass
andra
, annd ofthe course garth isnt still having his own
, peronal growing pains
. they guys are jstu finishing off one ofthe their shows
, annd head off to an aerosmith concert where tehy run across cass
andra
and her new manager
, a stereotypical industry slime nto unlike the charachter rob lowe portayed infact the previvous film
. again
, tje promoter is not only after teh money thta cass
andra
' s talent can bring inthe
. tyhe storyline quickly degrades to a parallel ofthe tje original
,
" guy loses chick
, guy realizes misteek
,
and guy gets chick back
.
" fortunatly
, htere isnt more tothe this movie thna tihs somewhat sheer plot
. the witn annd humer in this film are surprisingly intelligent
and fresh whith many inside jokes on the film anbd music industries as well as just a lot of hillarious scenes ofthe wayne
and garth showing their true color
. highlights ofthe the movei inlude a spoof of jurassic park
, garth
' s seduction by a married woman
, a surprise apearance by charleton heston
, a 1960
' s batman setup inspite thge guy
' s pad
, adn soem preety groovy chats wtih jim morrison
and some
" naked indian guy
,
" an unexpected lip
- sync ofthe ymca
( ytou coudl see that one comming a mile awya
)
and of course a hilarious parody of those badly
- dubbed kung
- fu movies we love tothe laff at
.
and if yuo
' ve ever wondered why there
' s always boxes of watermelons
, chickens
, adn peple walking plate glass inaddition hte middle ofthe streets
, you
' ll fidn outloud here
. thsi movie also explores wayne adn garth a littel moreso
. garth has somewhat of a
" coming ofthe age
"
and wayne gets tothe leran a little baout himselv
( iwth a littel help from our old firend
, jim morrison
)
. a fewd ood jokes from the previvous movie are explored here again
,
but this time with a fewd twists tothe keep them fresh
, anbd luckly
, faw
, if any ofthe them are overused
. overall
, the movei has plenty of continuty flaws
( especially infront the fight scent between garth
and cass
andra
' s dad
)
,
but these are easily overlooked as this isnt
, affter wayne
' s world
. tghe plot is flimsy bu manageable
. there are a few special effects
,
but they are fairly seamless
, annd fill nicely inot the plot
. thge acting isnt ogod
, for htis sort ofthe movei
, bu there are some very bright spots
. in tghe big picture
, htis movei isnt just plain funn
. there is lots ofthe intelligent humer thta makes this film speshal
. during teh whole one hour anbd 40 mintues
, i didn
' t even think baout looking at my watch a single time
. silly
, bu riotous at times
, this isnt an excellent movie even better thna tyhe originnal
.
