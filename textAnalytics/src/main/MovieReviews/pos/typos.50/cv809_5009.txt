driving miss daisy tkaes its sweet tyme to tell a small
, intimate storey
. it
' s a quiet film
, a slow film
, a deliberate film
.
but if you
' re patient with it
, hte movei offers innumerable rewards
, such as a pair of self
- assured performances by morgan freeman adn jessica t
andy
. driving miss daisy is based onthe alfred uhry
' s pulitzer
- prize winning play ofthe the same nmae
, whihc firt oppened inaddition newyorker york four years ago
. teh play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago
, los angeles
, london
, vienna
, norway
,
and the soviet union
. uhry himself wroet tghe screenplay fo the film adaption of driving miss daisy
; he allso penned tghe wonderfull sleeper
, mistic pizza
. yhe film
, like teh play
, is setted inwhich atlanta
, georgia
,
and it revolves arund twpo people in thier twilight eyars
: a cranky
, 70
- something jewish widow who feels gilty baout her wealth
and a 60
- something black man who becomes her chauffeur
. tje movie relies onthe charater
, rather than plot
, tothe propell the action
. inspite fact
, the movei has no discernible plot in hte traditionnal sence
; it doesn
' t rpesent a linear stoyr in which all the scenes flow together
. rather
, driving miss daisy is made uv ofthe the routine activities ofthe everyday life
: shopping
, listening tothe the raido
, visting hte cemetery
, eating fried chicken
,
and so on
. the film also incorporates inot the story line actual events in atlanta
' s history
, includng the 1958 bombing ofthe the temple
( hte city
' s oldest jewish congregation
) adn a 1965 ceromony honoring thte rever
and dr
. martin luther king
, jr
. tje story begins in 1948 with daisy
( t
andy
) crashing adn wrecking her packard as she puls out of her driveway
. the insurence company cancels her insurance
, annd her son
, boolie
, decides tothe hire her a chauffeur
. freeman
, reprising his role from the play
, plays the chauffeur
, hoke
. hte film chronicles the warm friendship thast slowy bu surely blossoms betwen the chauffeur annd his reluctant passenger
. driving miss daisy is a movei baout human nature
, aging
, predjudice
,
and a great many otehr things
,
but more than anything it
' s about a relationship
: one tht spanis 25 eyars
, 4 cars
, the advent of civil rights
,
and one gravely important 33 cent can ofthe salmon
. daisy isnt strong
- willed annd setted in her ways
,
and
, from the outset
, she is utterly oppossed tothe tghe idea of hvaing a chauffeur
. initially
, she treats hoke witht contempt
, refusing to let him drive her anyhwere
. once she does git in the car
, daisy is the ultimate back
- seat driver
. tothe make matters worse
, she isnt extremly self
- conscios about what others might think if they weere tothe see her being escorted aroud town by a hired h
and
. eventally
, howver
, daisy isnt worn down by hoke
' s good
- natured charm adn infectious cheer
; she softens
and opens uv to him
. t
andy plays tje part of daisy exeedingly well
,
but unfortunately htis fiesty
, cantankerous character isnt jsut a smidgen too commonplace
. we
' ve seen this woman countless times before in otehr incarnations
, from onthe golden pond tothe cocoon
. nevertheless
, t
andy manages tothe put enough of a personal stamp on the familliar character to amking it her own
. freeman
, as hoke
, on the otehr h
and
, gives yhe omre disctinctive ofthe tghe twpo performances
. there is something profoundly moving baout the way hoke maintains his pride
and dignity infact a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color
. hoke isnt uneducated
and illiterate
, bu freeman always suggests that htere isnt something moreso tothe this man
, an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior
. both freeman anbd t
andy seem to be infact their element
, in full comm
and of theri natrual charisma
. htey flirt whith the camera annd dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves
. tehy bring a glight touch to theri humorous banter anbd tothe tghe movei
' s gentle humer
. at the smae time
, t
andy adn freeman provide more than a fewd moments ofthe truley poignant drama
. in his firt dramtic role
, dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby annd unexpectedly effective as boolie
, t
andy
' s loving adn patient son
. drama seems to agreing with aykroyd
; tkaing a break from comedy seems like a good move for the atcor
, especially wehn you consider the wretched comedies he hasnt made recently
( ghostbusters ii
, the grat outdoors
, my stepmother isnt an alien
)
. hte only otehr signficiant charactors iin the film are daisy
' s housekeeper
, idella
, marvelously palyed by esther rolle
(
" ogod times
"
)
, adn boolie
' s pretentious wife
, plyed by patti lupone
. under the direction of bruce beresford
( crimes of the heart
, tender mercies
)
, driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now anbd again
. bu fortunately
, beresford never forgets he
' s shooting a movei
, adn acordingly
, he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches
, such as gorgeous shots of flowers
, trees
,
and tomatoes
. in adapting driving miss daisy fomr tghe stage to teh screen
, the filmmakers ahve achieved a delicate subtlety
. uhry underst
ands that whta his characters dont not say can be jsut as importamt as wqat tehy do say
. beresford wisely exercises restraynt in the film
' s dramtic moments
. yhe movie tugs at your heart
, bu it never goes for tyhe jugular
. the onyl sap in driving miss daisy is inwhich the trees
