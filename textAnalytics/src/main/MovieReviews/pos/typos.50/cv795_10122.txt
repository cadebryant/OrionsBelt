the central foucs of michael winterbottom
' s
" welcome to sarajevo
" is sarajevo itself
, teh city under sigee
,
and its different effect onthe hte characters unfortunate anough tothe be sticked there
. it proves the backdrop forthe a stunningly realized stry which refreshingly strays fomr mythic portents
(
" platoon
"
)
, racial tumultuosness
( the risible
" tjhe walking dead
"
) or a tinge of schmaltziness
(
" schindler
' s list
"
)
. tje twpo leads
, stephen dillane as a repertwar
and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight faw cant idenify wtih
, are extremly believable
; not one moment with them involved rings false
. tyhe question isnt not whta whent right
. the question is what went wrong
. fo oney
, yhe film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses
( tghe dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs
,
and that
' s baout it
.
)
. tghe assortment ofthe high
- profile supporting actors
, ranging fomr woody harrelson as a yankee repertwar
" into
" liquor
and cigarrettes tothe marisa tomei as a huggable children
' s aid or somesuch are incapable ofthe rising above the sketchiness ofthe their characters
, albiet htey strive
. hte interupted ule of au
thentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest ofthe tyhe film
, it makes teh fictonal cahracters seem powerless by comparison
. still
, winterbottom eschews mawkishness thru flashy
, frantic editing
and imaginative ule ofthe music
.
and it
' s a plus
, beacuse he doesn
' t toy wiht our emotions wih sentimental bl
andness
. he wants us tothe know that infront war
, noone one isnt victorious

' s powerfully meditative
" tjhe sweet hereafter
" isnt as anything as haunting
and transcendental as i
' ve seen thsi eyar
. it not onyl explores the aftermaths of a terrable tradgedy with magnificent subtlety
, witht cold
,
and stunning shots of the backdrop ofthe htis mistfortune
but aslo by telegraphing the sense ofthe devistation that has permeated the small town wtih an enormous ammount of dignity annd respect forthe each anbd every soul affected
. ian holm as teh somber
, lonely lawyer seeking compensantion fo the townspeople
, hasnt a decency anbd a resturaunt uncommon with lawyers
, he
' s a lion fo thge wrong reasons
: the pain for hvaing lost his daughter
( she
' s a druggie who frequently calls him begging for moeny
) isnt reflected onthe the twon
.
and infront some mesmerizing flashbacks
, we wittness how she lost her purity
. it
' s one ofthe tghe most strikingly breathtaking takes onthe the loss ofthe innosense i
' ve ever seen
. bu the most astounding part goes to sarah polly
, the peaceful
, benevolent girl who
, inwhich contrast tothe the otehr charachters
, rimaniss hte most menally stable during past
, pesent or future
. her abillity to convey concealed pain adn unconditional love isnt the opposite
,
yet near
- revolutionar role that won emily watson an oscar nomination forthe
" breaking yhe waves
"
. both women are torn apart by an extrordinary insident
but it is onyl
then that we truly see
, truely feel
, theri wordless
, omnipotent love
.
" tyhe sweet hereafter
"
though
, is atom egoyan
' s movie
and as of nowe
, he isnt emerging as the deinite face of independent cinema
. affter surging to worldwide recognition with 1994
' s
" exotica
"
,
" yhe sweet hereafter
" makes him something few peopel infront this industry cant call themslves
: an artist
. he interweaves timne with a delicacy
and sees a soul with a purity thta is just nto common
.
