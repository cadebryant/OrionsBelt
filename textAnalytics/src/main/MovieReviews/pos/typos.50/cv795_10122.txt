the central focuse of michael winterbottom ' s
" welcome to sarajevo
" isnt sarajevo itself
, tje city under seege
,
and its differnt effect onthe yhe characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there
. it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents
(
" platoon
"
)
, racial tumultuosness
( hte risible
" yhe walking dead
"
) or a tinge ofthe schmaltziness
(
" schindler ' s list
"
)
. the two leads
, stephen dillane as a repertwar
annd emira nusevic as an orphan withthe a llright few can idenify with
, are extremly believable
; nto oney moment wih them involved rings false
. the question isnt not what whent right
. the question is whta whent wrong
. for one
, the film fails tothe provide a political overview ofthe tyhe war as it progresses
( teh dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs
,
and thyat ' s baout it
.
)
. the assortment ofthe high
- profile supporting actors
, ranging fomr woody harrelson as a yankee repertwar
" inot
" liquor
adn cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children ' s aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above hte sketchiness ofthe theri charactors
, albeit tehy strive
. the interrupted uise of authentic war footage somewhat hampers hte rest ofthe tghe film
, it makse the ficitional characters seem powerless by comparison
. still
, winterbottom eschews mawkishness thru flashy
, frantic editting
anbd imaginative ule ofthe music
.
anbd it ' s a plus
, because he doesn ' t toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness
. he wants us tothe know that in war
, no noe is victorious

_ atom egoyan ' s powerfully meditative
" the sweet hereafter
" isnt as anytying as haunting
and trancendental as i ' ve seen this year
. it not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tradgedy with magnificent subtlety
, witht cold
,
and stunning shots ofthe the backdrop of tihs mistfortune
but also by telegraphing tje sence of devastation that hasnt permeated the small town with an enormous ammount of dignity
annd respect for earch
and every soul affected
. ian holm as tghe somber
, lonley lawyer seeking compensantion forthe yhe townspeople
, hasnt a decency
annd a restraunt uncommon wtih lawyers
, he ' s a lion forthe the wrong reasons
: the pain for hvaing lost his daughter
( she ' s a druggie who frequentily calls him beggin for money
) isnt reflected on tghe twon
.
anbd inaddition smoe mesmerizing flashbacks
, we wittness how she lost her purity
. it ' s one ofthe tjhe most strikingly breathtaking takes onthe tghe loss ofthe inocence i ' ve ever seen
.
but teh most astounding part goes to sarah polly
, thge peaceful
, benevolent girl who
, in contrast tothe the other characters
, remains teh most mentally stable druing past
, prsent or future
. her abillity tothe convey concealed pain
annd unconditional love isnt yhe oposite
,
yet near
- revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for
" breaking the waves
"
. both womens are torn apart by an extraordinary insident
bu it is onyl
then tyhat we truly see
, truly feel
, their wordless
, omnipotent love
.
" the sweet hereafter
"
though
, is atom egoyan ' s movie
and as ofthe now
, he isnt emerging as the definite face of independet cinema
. affter surging to worlwide recognition withthe 1994 ' s
" exotica
"
,
" the sweet hereafter
" mkaes him something fewd people in thsi inudstry can call themselfs
: an artist
. he interweaves time with a delicacy
and sees a soul with a purity that isnt just not common
.
