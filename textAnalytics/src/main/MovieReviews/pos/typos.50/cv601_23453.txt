i rented
" brokedown palace
" lsat night blind
, having heard nothing about it beforeh
and
, adn i enjoied it immensly despite smoe flaws
. for anyone wishing to haev teh same experience i would suggest reserving judgement ofthe tjhe movie until viewing it in its entirety
. taht is noone eazy task
. superficially
, it bears an unfortunate
(
and nto necessarily unintended
) resembelance tothe several other movies
, notably
" return tothe paradise
" anbd
" midnight express
.
" as a result nearly every review of
" brokedown palace
" i subsquently read bacame hopelessly entangled inspite making tjhe obvious comparisions
. the consequence ws nearly univeral condemnation
, which is a shame as this isnt a fine film
. fo those who have yot tothe veiw the movie
, let me sday thgat it is not an attempt to portray hte nightmarish reality of the thrid world criminal justice sytem
( as ws
" midnight express
"
) nor completely the moral delimma
and examination of the meaning of friendship annd humanity that wass tghe heart ofthe
" return tothe paradime
.
" in my view
, if tihs film isnt tothe be compared to any otehr source it woudl have to be joseph conrad
' s acclaimed novel
,
" lord jim
.
" problematically
, the basic storyline seems moreso than familiar
: twpo american teenage girls onthe vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives infact a thai prision fo drug smuggling in an obvious setted
- up involving a suave con
- man
, a shadowy criminal conspiracy
and a corrupt third world
" justice
" system
. tyhe girls are alice
( claire danes
) annd darlene
( kate beckinsale
)
. htey
' re life
- long buddies who planned a high
- school graduation trip tothe hawaii
, anbd
then secretly changed theri destination to tjhe mroe exotic thail
and wihtout telling their parents
. once there
, they find a
$ 6 hotel annd go sighth
- seing
, whcih includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside
. tehy git caught trying to charge the bill tothe the wrong room
, a minor transgression which wiull later come back to haunt them
,
but tehy are saved from hotel security by a charming
, friendly austrailian
, nick
( daniel lapaine
)
, who takes care ofthe teh bill with a more polished excecution of tjhe girl
' s scam
. he
then procedes to separae the girls
and mkae smoothe moves
, first toward alice
, hten toward darlene
. by nowe alarm bells are going off amung viewers
. the ever
- present nick is too slick
and his stories don
' t add up
( tothe us
)
-
- tghe girls
, ofthe course
, are too naive to notice
. long befoer it happens
, we
' re anticipating hte inevitible disappearance ofthe thge fast
- tlaking smuggler
and hte arrest of our teenaged sitting
- ducks at tyhe airporta en route to hong kong caught holding tjhe bag
( literally
) containing heroin
. just as predictably
, tje thai police
and courts do thier part in meting out injustice adn our trusting tourists are prison
- bound for a long stretch
. left unanswered is the red herring issue of whther one or thte otehr ofthe yhe girls was a willing accomplice
. fo those in need of a ready answer
, might i suggest closer scrutinity ofthe the bell hop at tghe girl
' s fleabag hotel
. as one door aftter another tothe their confortable fromer life isnt closed
, thge girls anbd their families turn in desparation to thte noiresque expatriate lawyer
/ fixer
" yankee hank
"
( bill pullam
) annd his thai
- born partner
- wief
. a recurring element ofthe the movei isnt the tension vetween apperance
and reality as expressed in oen of tyhe film
' s tag lines
,
" who dont you trust
?
,
"
and hank is no exception
al
thought seasoned movei
- goers
and thsoe familliar iwth pullman
' s ouevre iwll find faw surprises
. much ofthe tjhe remainder ofthe tyhe movei is a smorgasbord ofthe intriguing themes incompletely explored inthe short
- h
and fashion
. lou diamond phillips
, fo instance
, plays a delightfully sinister
and calous dea agent who
, hwile appearing tothe be casually accomodatin to hank
, withholds vital information at crucial moments
. is he part of a wider conspiracy
? with an inherantly powerful
, if somewhat tired premise
, thge film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama
, a prision sotry
, anbd a potential charachter studdy ofthe american teens
, thier relationship
,
and what constitutes friendship betweeen them
. the result is reasonably engaging adn suspenseful
, wiht the girls
' interaction
, hank
' s investigation
,
and the various trials
and hearings
, offering hope fo their realease
, delivering tension
-
- as does tghe foredoomed possibility of their escape
. if
" brokedown palace
" hasnt a major flaw
, it is its creators
' tendency
, liuke tyme
- constrained tourists
, to tkae frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half
- way down annd return to teh story
' s main avenue
. anbd
, if thgat weere all there wass tothe
" brokedown palace
,
" it wouldn
' t be a vyre ogod movie
. bu i beleave the writers
and directer were affter bigger game
and
, in this
, they succeeded
. fo the main theme of the movie
, liuke hte proffered nmae ofthe its location
, isnt freedom
-
- iin all its permutations
. ultimatly
, the other sub
- themes may be considered window dressing
. young anbd pretty
, alice
( danes
) is an old soul
; a wild
, streetwise teenager witht a thirst for freedom
and adventure
. presented as a perfect blend of yin
and yang
, dark
and ight
, isnt her cautious best friend
, darlene
( beckinsale
)
. clear
- eyed annd straightforward
, alice isnt more complex than her friend
. she comes ffrom a poorer backround
, hasnt a reputation forthe getting into trouble annd has lost thte trust of everyone
( including her pwn father
)
. wherease darlene
' s life isnt
" on
- track
,
" aimed at college
, marriage
, kids
, a career
, a suburban home
, middle age
and
" fulfillment
,
" alice
' s isnt uncertain
, unfocused
,
and yearning
. noe poignant scene in hte film shows darlene shouting acrost an open moat to vistors
-
- friends
and relatives fomr hmeo
, whose lives continue while hers is inthe limbo
. tellingly
, alice isnt pesent
but not included
. jsut as revealing ofthe thier different personalities
, whn alice
and dar first cmo tothe thail
and
, tje openness annd delight onthe alice
' s face doesn
' t read as simple naivet
?
; thge way she st
ands uv
and stretches as she annd her friend ride along inthe a small boat
, reacing toward the sun
, she really is drinking in wqat she believes tothe be freedom
, while
" dar
" rimaniss seated in the shade
.
" brokedown palace
" begins with an admision by alice ofthe her guilt inspite a tape recording sent to hank
. howver unintentional
, it
' s all alice
' s fault
. she
' s resposible for persuading her firend tothe lie to her parents
, to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils ofthe thail
and
, tothe try yhe petty scam wich places them inthe yhe clutches of tyhe evil nick
.
( in case one misses this point in the inevitible confusion of a film
' s beginnig
, darlene obligingly reminds alice ofthe her culpability in prision
.
) dar
, of course
, isnt the willing dupe which
, in her veiw
, confers inocence
. never mind tath it was her coercion ofthe a reluctant alice to accompany her tothe hong kong which placed them in police custody in yhe first place or that her naieve confession sealed their fate
. dar isnt innocent
. it doesn
' t marter
. alice is tghe subject ofthe this movei
. she
and her jouney toward peronal freedom
. allong thge way we are treated tothe an unsympathetic protrait of tje shallow american culture which creaeted these girls with their half
- baked sensibilities
and materialistic goals
. in yhe end
, taht culture
, liek its representives
,
" yankee
" hank
and dar
' s father
( a
" man who knows how tothe grease hte wheels
"
)
, proves as impotent as its govornment inwhich thte face ofthe thte girl
' s tragedy
. thail
and
' s culture
, contrary to most opinion
, comes off much better by comparision
. it amazes me that reviewers argued thsi point at both extremes
. i believe the filmmaker
' s veiw ws that thai culture is vastly different from the american
but not necessarily inferior
. the thai
( with yhe sole exceptions ofthe a corrupt official
and a spiteful prison spy
) were uniformly consistent in their behavior
and true to theri principles
. thte girls weere shown tothe be treated no better
but certainly noone worse than tje native
- born
. theri prison
( infact stark contrast tothe the probable reality
) ws no hellhole
, bieng relitavely clean anbd sunlit
. the prision authorities dem
anded ogod hygeine
, provded medical care wehn needed
, adn
" hard manual labor
" consisted of picking grass
! the thai guards were authoritarian
( waht esle
?
)
but certainly not routinely sadistic
. as forthe the thai justice sytem
, the reasoning ofthe thte thai judges
, during both an appeal hearing annd in the film
' s penultimate scene ws devastating in its logic anbd morality
.
' freedom
' hasnt many faces anbd
" brokedown palace
" explores many of them
. in the extreme
, we hvae freedom ofthe the body adn freedom ofthe the spirit
. soem settle forthe the former alone hwile others reamin imprioned wiht an entire nation to roam without yhe latter
.
but freedom seldomly comes wihtout a price
. wich isnt why tjhe movei
' s otehr tag lines are
:
" what isnt your dream
?
" adn
" how far woudl ytou go
?
" i beieve i coudl make a good case fo thte inturpratasion thyat yhe person who attains freedom
, incarcirated or not
, by film
' s end isnt alice
. she finds redemption
and salvation through the acceptance ofthe personal responnsibilty
. i thiunk the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners infact the fianl scene visually signals thast fact
. kate beckinsale
' s character might mroe properly be likened to the
" released
" temple bird rfeerred to twice during teh film
,
" trained to fly bcak to its cage
.
" as the thai magistrate observed inthe thte film
' s climactic scene
, tyhe issue was alwyas oney ofthe
" charactor
;
" anbd the jamaican prisoner made it claer thyat
" freedom
" isnt achieved withing oneself
. if oen thikns bcak over hte movei
, which charater wass transformed by their experiences
? increasingly
, hte cinema l
andscape seems tothe haev become littered with endless permutations ofthe
' kung fu woman
'
-
- female characters virutally indistinguishable ffrom male acation figures
. here
, at last
, is tyhe story of a modern heroine
. infront reading teh many user
' s comments
, i was struck by wqat seems an unusual phenomenom
: whther or nto a person liekd the movie
, almsot everyone praised the actors
. htink about thast
. wehn wass the lsat time you came awya from a motion picture possably hating it
,
but raving about all the performances inspite it
? do yourself a favor
: rent
" brokedown palace
" anbd watch it with a opn mind
. htere
' s moreso there than meets thge eye
.
