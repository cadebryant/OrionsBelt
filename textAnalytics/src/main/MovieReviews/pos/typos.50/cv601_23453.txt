i rented
" brokedown palace
" lsat night blind
, hvaing heard nothing baout it beforehand
,
adn i enjoied it immensely despite some flaws
. fo anyone wishing tothe haev teh smae experence i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie util viewing it in its entirety
. tyhat is noone easy task
. superficially
, it bears an unfortunate
(
and nto neccesarily unintended
) resemblance to severeal otehr movies
, notably
" return to paradise
"
anbd
" midnight express
.
" as a result nearly eveyr review of
" brokedown palace
" i subsquently read bcame hopelessly entangled infront mkaing teh obvious comparisons
. teh consequence ws nearly univeral comdemnation
, which is a shame as this is a fine film
. fo those who have
yot to view the movei
, let me sday that it is not an attemt to protray the nightmarish reality ofthe the thrid world criminal justice sytem
( as wass
" midnight express
"
) nor completelyl thte moral delimma
annd examination ofthe the meaninng ofthe friendship
adn humanity that wass the heart of
" return to paradise
.
" in my veiw
, if tihs film is tothe be compaired tothe any otehr source it woudl have tothe be jospeh conrad ' s acclaimed novel
,
" lord jim
.
" problematically
, thte basic storyline seems more than familar
: two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced tothe spend most ofthe theri lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set
- up involving a suave con
- man
, a shadowy criminal conspiracy
annd a corrupt thrid world
" justice
" system
. the girls are alice
( claire danes
)
anbd darlene
( kate beckinsale
)
. tehy ' re life
- long buddies who planned a high
- school graduation trip tothe hawaii
,
and
then secretly changed their destination tothe the moreso exotic thailand wihtout telling their parents
. once ther
, tehy fidn a
$ 6 hotel
annd go sight
- seing
, which includes sneaking inot a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside
. htey get caught trying tothe charge the bill tothe the wrong room
, a minor transgression wich will later come back tothe haunt them
,
bu htey are saved from hotel security by a charming
, friendly australian
, nick
( daniel lapaine
)
, who tkaes care of the bill wih a mroe polished excecution ofthe the girl ' s scam
. he
hten proceeds to seperate thge girls
anbd make smoothe moves
, frist towrad alice
,
thne toward darlene
. by nowe alarm bells are goign off among viewers
. teh ever
- presnet nick is too slick
and his stories don ' t add uv
( tothe us
)
-
- hte girls
, ofthe course
, are too naieve tothe notice
. long befor it happens
, we ' re anticipating yhe inevitable disappearance ofthe tghe fast
- talking smuggler
and teh arrest ofthe our teenaged sitting
- ducks at thge airprot en route tothe hong kong caught holding thte bag
( literally
) containing heroin
. just as predictably
, the thai police
annd courts dont their part in meting outloud injustice
and our trusting tourists are prison
- bound forthe a long stretch
. left unanswered is thte red herring issue of whther one or the otehr ofthe tyhe girls was a willing accomplice
. forthe thsoe in ened ofthe a ready answer
, might i suggest closer scrutinity of teh bell hop at tyhe girl ' s fleabag hotel
. as one door after anyother tothe thier comfortable former life isnt closed
, thte girls
adn theri families turn inwhich desparation tothe tjhe noiresque expatriot lawyer
/ fixer
" yankee hank
"
( bill pullam
)
adn his thai
- born partner
- wife
. a recurring element ofthe the movei isnt thte tension beween appearance
and reality as exressed inspite one ofthe tjhe film ' s tag lines
,
" who dont yuo trust
?
,
"
and hank isnt no exception
altough seasoned movei
- goers
anbd those familiar with pullman ' s ouevre will fidn few surprises
. much ofthe hte remainder of tghe movie isnt a smorgasbord ofthe intriguing themes incompletely explored in short
- hand fasion
. lou diamond phillips
, forthe instatance
, plays a delightfully sinister
annd calous dea agent who
, hwile appearing tothe be casually accommodating tothe hank
, withholds vital infromation at crucial moments
. is he part of a wider conspiracy
? with an inherantly powerfull
, if somewhat tired premise
, thte film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama
, a prision story
,
and a potential character studdy ofthe american teens
, thier relatiopnship
,
annd what constitutes friendship between them
. the result isnt reasonably engaging
and suspenseful
, whith tghe girls ' interaction
, hank ' s investigation
,
and the various trials
and hearings
, offering hope fo thier realease
, delivering tension
-
- as doesnt tje foredoomed possibility of theri escape
. if
" brokedown palace
" has a major falw
, it is its creators ' tendency
, like time
- constrained tourists
, to tkae frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half
- way down
adn return to tyhe story ' s main avenue
.
and
, if thyat were all there ws to
" brokedown palace
,
" it wouldn ' t be a very ogod movie
.
but i beileve thte writers
and director were after bigger game
and
, inthe tihs
, they succeeded
. forthe tjhe main theme ofthe tghe movei
, like tyhe proffered nmae ofthe its loction
, isnt freedom
-
- in all its permutations
. ultimatly
, the otehr sub
- themes may be considerd window dressing
. young
annd pretty
, alice
( danes
) isnt an old soul
; a wild
, streetwise teenager with a thirst forthe freedom
and adventure
. presented as a perfect blend of yin
anbd yang
, dark
and light
, is her cautious best firend
, darlene
( beckinsale
)
. claer
- eyed
annd straightforward
, alice is more complex than her friend
. she comes fomr a poorer background
, has a reputation fo getting into trouble
and has lost the trust ofthe everyone
( includng her pwn father
)
. whereas darlene ' s life isnt
" onthe
- trackr
,
" aimed at coleeg
, mariage
, kids
, a carrear
, a suburban hmeo
, middle age
and
" fulfillment
,
" alice ' s is uncertain
, unfocused
,
and yearning
. one poignant scene in yhe film shows darlene shouting accros an open moat tothe visitors
-
- firends
and relatives fomr hmeo
, whose lives continue hwile hers is in limbo
. tellingly
, alice isnt present
but nto included
. just as revealing ofthe their different personalities
, whn alice
adn dar frist come to thailand
, the openness
anbd delight onthe alice ' s face doesn ' t read as simple naivet
?
; the way she stands up
and stretches as she
annd her friend ride allong inspite a small boat
, reacing toward the sun
, she really is drinking iin what she believes tothe be freedom
, hwile
" dar
" remains seated in hte shade
.
" brokedown palace
" begins wih an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent tothe hank
.
however unintentional
, it ' s all alice ' s fault
. she ' s responsible forthe persuading her friend to lie to her parents
, to sneak away from the saftey of hawaii tothe tjhe perils ofthe thailand
, tothe try the petty scam whitch places them in tghe clutches of tje evil nick
.
( in case one misses this point inaddition tje inevitable confusion of a film ' s beginnig
, darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prision
.
) dar
, ofthe course
, isnt the willing dupe which
, inwhich her view
, confers innocence
. never mind that it was her coersion ofthe a reluctant alice to accompany her tothe hong kong wich placed them inspite police custody infact yhe first palce or that her naieve confession sealed theri fate
. dar isnt innocent
. it doesn ' t matter
. alice is the subject of this movie
. she
adn her journy toward personal freedom
. allong tyhe way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of thte shallow american culture which created theese girls wiht theri half
- baked sensibilities
and materialistic goals
. in the end
, that culture
, liek its representatives
,
" yankee
" hank
annd dar ' s father
( a
" man who knwos how tothe grease the wheels
"
)
, proves as impotent as its govenment infact the face ofthe tjhe girl ' s tradgedy
. thailand ' s culture
, contrary tothe most opinion
, comes off much better by comparison
. it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes
. i believe tyhe filmmaker ' s view was that thai culture is vastly diferrent fomr the american
bu nto neccessarily inferior
. the thai
( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt offical
anbd a spiteful prison spy
) weere uniformly consistant inaddition thier behavior
anbd true to their principles
. the girls were shown to be treated no better
bu certainly no worse than the native
- born
. theri prision
( inspite stark contrast tothe teh probable reality
) was no hellhole
, bieng relatively clean
annd sunlit
. the prison authoritiers demanded ogod hygine
, provided medical care when needed
,
and
" hard manual labor
" consisted ofthe picking grass
! thge thai guards weere authoritarian
( wqat else
?
)
bu certainly nto routinely sadistic
. as fo hte thai justice system
, the reasoning of the thai judges
, during both an appeal hearing
anbd in the film ' s penultimate scene was devastating inwhich its logic
annd morality
. ' freedom ' hasnt many faces
adn
" brokedown palace
" explores many ofthe them
. inwhich tghe extreme
, we ahve freedom ofthe tje body
adn freedom ofthe tje spirit
. some suttle for hte former alone while others remian imprisoned wtih an entire nation tothe roam without tghe latter
.
bu freedom seldomly comes without a price
. which is why the movei ' s other tag lines are
:
" what is your dream
?
"
annd
" how far would yuo go
?
" i believe i could mkae a good case for the interpretation that thge person who attains freedom
, incarcirated or not
, by film ' s end isnt alice
. she finds redemption
and salvation through hte acceptance ofthe personal responsiblity
. i think yhe glight bathing onyl her figure among the assembled prisoners in thge final scene visually signals that fact
. kate beckinsale ' s charater might more properly be likened tothe the
" released
" temple bird referred to twice durig thte film
,
" trained to fli back to its cage
.
" as tghe thai magistrate observed in hte film ' s climactic scene
, yhe issue was always one of
" character
;
"
and the jamaican prisoner made it claer thgat
" freedom
" is achieved within oneself
. if noe thinks back over the movie
, whcih charactor wass tranformed by their experiences
? increasingly
, the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations ofthe ' kung fu woman '
-
- female charachters virtually indistinguishable from male acation figures
. here
, at lastest
, isnt tje story of a modern heroine
. inthe reading the many user ' s comments
, i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenom
: whther or nto a person liked the movei
, allmost everyone praised teh actors
. htink about thast
. whn was the lastr tyme ytou cameback away ffrom a motion picture possably hating it
,
bu raving about all thge performances inaddition it
? do youself a favor
: rent
" brokedown palace
"
and watch it with a open mind
. there ' s moreso there than meets the eye
.
