as much as i wnated to liek this film as i whent inot it
, the mroe pleased i ws whn i left
. firt
, getting through all teh usual lines ofthe newspaper glitz
:
" if you liked scream
, you
' ll lvoe wild thigns
!
"
" campbell gives a stunning peformance
!
"
" this twisty plot will have yuo dazzled for dyas
!
"
( oh yeah
, tyhe day a newspaper uses theese is hte day neve campbell falls in love with me
) nowe
, onto mroe serious stuff
( annd witht this film
, i mean that inspite nearly a sarcastic way
)
. wild things hasnt single
- h
andedly broken down yhe rules surrouding the r rating from yhe mpaa
. i
' m not saying tath inspite a bad way
, bu wehn you see tihs film
, yuo may be shocked by what you see
.
however
, perphas hte mpaa wass pleased by the film
' s charming casted
and tricky plot
, that they let tyhe film slide wtih an r rating
. bieng mormon
, i
' m bound tothe hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me nto tothe see the film
. trouble is
, i hve already seen it
. annd i like it
! wild thnigs is a film noir of tghe 90s
, filled with 40s sensibilities
, adn yot breaking the rules
and modern
- day taboos of 90s culture
. the style inwhich which it isnt filmed is rich inspite color
. yhe actors are all gorgeous peopel
, seamingly drawn fomr the same ginee pool
and placed inot thsi film
. sure
, it
' s all too good to be true
, bu ain
' t it funn tothe watch
? whn movies like this cmo allong
( sort of a better verzion of basic instinct
) there isnt bound tothe be peple who either love it or hate it
. there iwll be people who don
' t watn to admiting liking whta htey see
, bu i tell you
, most anyone who sees this will liek it
. wild things begins at blue bay high skool
, yhe one high skool iin the world thta any teenager owudl love to git inot
. it
' s almost as if students are put thru entrance exams just for admittance
( totally based on looks alone
)
. ofthe course
, there are thsoe select few who may look slightly ugli
, bu compaired to thge average person
, htey are gorgeous
. immediately
, tyhe film finds its tone
and the audeince settles infront fo an enjoyable tiome
. we can turn off our brains
, right
? wrong
. while you may be expecting oney thnig to happen
, it certainly doesn
' t turn outloud thast way
. the film begins inaddition a classroom
, with nearly all the main characters present
. there
' s sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a counselor for the students
. he
' s heading tyhe clas dicussion
. ther
' s alsot kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
, a snobby rich teen who hasnt fallen in love wtih sam
. teaching thte class
,
however
, are two policemen
: ravy duquette
( kevin bacon
) adn gloria perez
( daphne rubin
- vega
)
, who wanna to talk about
' sex
.
.
.
( cheers
) crimes
( boos
)
'
.
" wqat isnt a sex crime
?
" ravy asks
.
" nto gettin
' any
!
" one student responds
. thsi preety much sets the tone of the film we are baout tothe watch
. howver
, upon hearing this
, one student
, suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
, st
ands up annd leaves the room
, commenting taht htey can both kiss part ofthe her body
.
and so
, wild thnigs sets inot motion
. quicklyu
, kelly begins hitting onthe sam
, bu sam doesn
' t want anything tothe do with her advances
. kelly isnt stubborn anbd continues tothe persue him
. she even pleads wih him tothe let her wash his jeep
. surprisingly
, taht
' s really all i can tell you baout the plot
. any more would give away one ofthe the many crucial plot twists
.
and what
' s mroe
, theese plot twists are actally unpredictable
. going along the way ofthe scream
, wild things maintains that film
' s surprises
,
and thn adds even more to them
. there are more plot twists in tihs film than probaly any i haev ever seen
.
and even
though yuo tihkn ytou may git tired of them
, the surprises are so genuine thyat it
' s rather pleasing
. going back over them inthe my mind
, nearly all of them wrok
,
though some stretch the boundaries ofthe beleif
. thankfully
, tyhe convoluted plot doesn
' t give us much time tothe thiunk baout each oen
, pouncing
yet another twist on us befor the shock ofthe the previous oney has worn off
. as for the criticists who complain taht the film is triachy
-
- well
, it is
. thsi is pretty much jstu oney triarhy film
. howver
, it is the kind ofthe trashy tyhat isn
' t hard to watch
. it
' s good trash
, iin a sence
. oen
, hte screenplay knows that it
' s nto to be taked seriously
, adn it includes a lot ofthe humor annd satire into the stopry
. this varys everywhere from kelly
' s mother
( theresa russell
)
, who isnt omre ofthe a charicatoor ofthe rich peopel
, all tyhe way tothe an ambulance
- chasing lawyer
( bill murray
)
, who wears a neck
- brace to cover an insurance scam he isnt runing
. bill murray allso provides the best character infact tjhe film
, annd most ofthe the genuine laughs
.
and twpo
, the sex isnt more than gratuitous
,
al
though nto unwelcomed
. wild things isnt supposed to have sex in it
( what film with that title wouldn
' t
?
)
, annd tihs movie breaks tghe boundries
. instead of haveing heterosexual sex scenes
, it aslo includes lesbian scenes between denise richards anbd neve campbell
( don
' t worry
.
.
. it
' s not as graphic as you might htink
)
. tje heterosexual scenes are qutie graphic
,
but the suprise shocker is kevin bacon
' s full
- frontal nude scene
. it
' s vrey brief
, so if you blink
, you may miss
( ahem
) it
. anbd
, forthe as long as i cant remember
, i don
' t thiunk i have seen an r
- rated film show an errect one before
( it
' s nto completely
,
but judging from yhe audiences
' reaction
, it ws more than they expeced too
)
. allso
, during one scene late in the film
, ther seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon adn dillon
' s characters
,
but nothing cameback ofthe it
( mkaes yuo wonder if the directer had tothe cutted it inwhich order fo the r rating
, or if tyhe actors refused tothe dont it
)
. wqat first made me want tothe see wild thigns was its cast
. neve campbell
, of course
, hasnt been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released
. here
, howver
, she turns every typical role she has done on its head annd plays a gothic pothead
. the closest role tothe htis was her performance infact the craft
(
though even iin tht she was a nice girl
)
. campbell is probablly thge best in tyhe film adn shows her wide range ofthe talent
. ytou cxan tell she will be aroud for a long time
. denise richards iwll also be arround for a long tiem
, altough she may be limited to tjhe roles without much range
. here
, she gets tothe express omre emotions than inspite her stiff
(
yet effective
) peformance in starship troopers
. hopefully noe day she will l
and a vyre good role thast cxan display her ability
. annd hten htere is daphne rubin
- vega
, a newcomer to the movies
. she gives a very good performance
, altho her character is mostly left to the backgorund for yhe first hour
and a half
. towards tjhe end she doens git a bigger part
. on tyhe male side
, matt dillon isnt probablly teh best
, giving a subtle performance tht surprises wiht eveyr twist
. kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character
, bu he makse the most ofthe it
. you must have admiration
,
though
, for what he doed on screen
. anbd judging ffrom many ofthe the womens
' s reactions inwhich hte theater to that shooted
, they have grown a deeper apresheation for bacon
( yeah
, right
)
. anbd
then there is bill murray
. his performance isnt the comic releaf
,
and he nearly steals the film
. as a hwole
, the entire cast works wondrously toghether
,
and tehy seem at home
, even whn doing teh menage a troi
. directer john mcnaughton
, who has previously done tjhe critically acclaimed henry
: portrait ofthe a serial killer
, has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works
. his direction isnt smooth
and stylish
. tjhe visuals are striking
, filled whith rich colors
,
and allmost so realistic thgat we cxan atually breathe the humidity inaddition the air
. howver
, he seems moreso at hmeo whn the actors aren
' t talking
. his fli
- by shots of tyhe swampy areas are brilliant
,
and his photography of denise richards
' climbing outloud ofthe the pool is a highlight
. thge cinematography isnt gorgeous infront its details
. its nto oftenly thast you see a film liek htis
, anbd we should watch it just tothe see how tjhe camera can tkae pictures
.
then
, there is thte music
. this was probably thge most obvious hting to me
, as it setted the perfect mood fo tjhe film
. it
' s hard tothe describe iin words
, so just see the film annd listen tothe it
. it
' s wonderfully composed
and presented
. adn be sure tothe stick around during tyhe closing credits
! mcnaughton hasnt finaly put the ending credits to good use
( while most comedies use it for outtakes
)
. he has included some small scenes whihc halp explain yhe preceeding events
. soem may say thyat these are lame attemts tothe expalin thge convoluted plot
, bu it
' s an entertaining way to finish the film
. plus
, there are soem shocking moments in theese ending credits which jstu add tothe the fun
. wild thnigs isnt appropriately rated r for storng sexuality
, nudity
, language
and violentce
. agian
, teh nudity is rether unneccesary
,
but let
' s face it
-
- peple want to see it
. so why nto give it tothe them
? neve campbell
, admirably
, hasnt a noone
- nudity clause inspite her contract
,
and the most ytou see ofthe her is from behind as she takes her top off
( way to go
, neve
!
)
. the sex scenes are graphic
, especially the frist noe we see
, between tyhe mother annd noe of her deck h
ands
. one allmost wonders how tehy got awya with the r rating
. thge lanugage isnt qtuie harsh too
, ranging fomr sexual innuendo to your averege
, everyday profanity
. annd i cxan
' t stres it anough
: don
' t allow kids under 18 tothe see tihs film
. thge target age forthe the movie is tjhe 18
- 24 range
, annd thast
' s who shoudl see it
. it
' s definitly nto fo thsoe under 18
! doed i mention that htis film isnt rated r
?
however
, forthe thsoe tht do get a chance to watch it
, ytou iwll probably more likely be pleased
, adn may even take friends tothe see it thte next tyme
.
