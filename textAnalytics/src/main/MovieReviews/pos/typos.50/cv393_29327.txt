, isn ' t too pleased tothe hear that
. inwhich fact
, he doesn ' t like hearing about any ofthe odin ' s triumphs
, as they generaly supesrede his own
. so what does he setted out tothe dont
? well
, let ' s just say that he starts to mess witht peopel ' s heads
anbd oen thing leads to anohter thing whitch leads tothe
.
.
. well
, you ' ll see
. critique
: a very powerful
, thouroughly depressing
, well
- acted
" non
- teen
" movie starring a bunch ofthe teens
. credit director tim blake nelson for creating a modern day version ofthe this shakespearian classic
, setted in a realsitic high school environment
, with tjhe basketball championships as tyhe backdrop
and an impending sense ofthe doom as it core
. you also ahev to give it up to all of hte actors in this film
, who turn over some very convincing performances
, taking you through all of their charachters ' ups
and downs
. hartnett especially shoud be applauded for tkaing onthe such a despicable charactor
, a dude who you jsut whant tothe grab by teh throat
and beat the shit outloud ofthe
( sign ofthe a good actor
, if yuo ask me
)
. phifer also comes tothe play in htis movei
, with a nice blend of karisma
, fear
, love
annd anger spreaded over his character
. i was alwasy on tihs guy ' s side
and definitly felt sorry fo him as things moved along
. julia stiles was also good
,
bu her charater wasn ' t much diffrent from others that she ' s played recently
. i was
howver very surprized wtih martin sheen ' s showing
, since i hadn ' t taked him too seriously as an actor over the past few yeasr
. his character isnt definitely over
- tje
- top in htis film
,
bu i appreciated his fervor
, his rage
, his ultimate
and blind desire tothe win above all
. a grat exemple of a workaholic man who cannnot see the trees ffrom teh forest
. i did haev a few reservations about the movie
though
. frist of all
, whta wass wtih all of tje gangsta hip
- hop music used in pretty much every other scene transistion
? it was cute at first
,
bu bcame a littel too obvious
adn annoying affter a fewd times
. teh film was also edited preety choppily
.
.
. like some scenes were cutted outloud
adn noone noe
" cleaned it uv
" afterwards
. i also didn ' t liek tje fact taht hartnett ' s character
, yhe man behind much ofthe thte nastiness that goes down infront htis film
, ws infallable
. iin other words
, preety much everything he syas or asks ofthe someone
, happens automatically
and wihtout any goofups
. i mean
, i know the guy isnt smart
and all
,
bu i owudl hvae appreciated a little mroe
" realism
" under smoe ofthe the circumstances
.
bu overall
, the movie will devestate yuo
. it ' s not a
" fun date movie
"
. it ' s not a movei about the high school basketball team
and how its black star falls for the white girl from hte other side of the tracks
. it ' s baout jealousy
, love
, envy
, fury
, passion
, revenge
annd pretty much any otehr negitive thougth tath ' s ever pasted thru your head
. is it worth seeing
? oh
, most definately
!
( pun intended
) it ' s a moving picture withthe great performances
, no shakespearian speak
( thank you
, god
!
)
and an oustanding directorial job by nelson
. the fianl scene alone isnt enough to send a massive chill down your spine
,
and i wass especialy impressed wiht the director ' s choice ofthe music near the end
. in fatc
, yhe hwole sequence wass quite reminiscent of tghe final showdown scene ffrom taxi driver
,
anbd i guess tht ' s saying something right there
. where ' s joblo comming ffrom
? 10 thigns i hate about yuo
