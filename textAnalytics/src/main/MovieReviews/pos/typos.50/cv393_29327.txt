.
.
. well
, ytou
' ll see
. critique
: a vrey powerful
, throughly depressing
, well
- acted
" non
- teen
" movie starring a bunch of teens
. credit directer tim blake nelson forthe creating a modern day verzion ofthe this shakespearian clasic
, setted in a realsitic high skool environment
, with yhe basketball championships as tjhe backdrop
and an impending sence ofthe doom as it core
. yuo allso have tothe give it up tothe all of hte actors in htis film
, who turn over some very convincing performances
, taking ytou thru all ofthe their characters
' ups
and downs
. hartnett especialy should be applauded fo taking on such a dispicable charachter
, a dued who you jstu watn tothe grab by tghe throat
and beated the shit out ofthe
( sign of a good actor
, if you ask me
)
. phifer aslo comes to play inaddition this movie
, iwth a nice blend ofthe charisma
, fear
, loev adn anger spreaded over his charactor
. i was always on thsi guy
' s side
and definitly feeled sory for him as things moved along
. julia stiles wass alsot good
,
but her character wasn
' t much different ffrom others tht she
' s played recently
. i was howver vyer surprised wiht martin sheen
' s showing
, usance i hadn
' t taken him too seriously as an actor over tje past few yeasr
. his charcter is definitely over
- tyhe
- top in this film
,
but i appreciated his fervor
, his rage
, his ultimate adn blind desire tothe win above all
. a great example of a workaholic man who cannnot see the trees ffrom the forrest
. i did ahev a few reservations about the movei
though
. frist ofthe all
, what was wih all of teh gangsta hip
- hop music used in pretty much every other scene transition
? it wass cute at firt
, bu became a littel too obvious adn annoying aftter a few times
. the film was also edited preety choppily
.
.
. liek soem scenes were cut outloud anbd no oney
" cleaned it up
" afterwords
. i also didn
' t like the fact that hartnett
' s character
, the man behind much ofthe the nastiness that goes down inaddition this film
, wass infallible
. inspite other words
, preety much everthing he sasy or asks of somone
, happens automaticly adn without any goofups
. i mean
, i nkwo tghe guy is smart
and all
, bu i woudl ahve appreciated a little mroe
" realism
" under soem ofthe tjhe circumstances
.
but overall
, teh movei wiull devastate you
. it
' s nto a
" fun date movie
"
. it
' s nto a movei baout the high school basketball team
and how its black star falls fo yhe white girl from tghe otehr side of tje tracks
. it
' s baout jalusey
, love
, envy
, fury
, passion
, revenge
and pretty much any otehr negative throught that
' s ever passed through your head
. isnt it worth seeing
? oh
, most definitely
!
( pun intended
) it
' s a moving picture witht grat performances
, noone shakespearian speak
( thank ytou
, god
!
)
and an outst
anding directorial job by nelson
. hte final scene alone isnt enought tothe send a massive chill down your spine
,
and i ws especialy empressed with tje directer
' s choise ofthe music near thte end
. inwhich fact
, the hwole sequence was qtuie reminiscent of the final showdown scene ffrom taxi driver
,
and i guess tyhat
' s saying something right htere
. where
' s joblo comming from
? 10 thigsn i hite baout you
