he hasnt spended his entire life inspite an awful littel appartment
, rised annd cared forthe
and imprisoned by his domineering mother
. she inspires his love
and his fear
, adn instills infront him a similar lvoe
and fear ofthe jesus
. he hasnt a rudimentry grasp of laguage
, mouthing monosyllables
and repetitions of his mother
' s phrases
. he is teached that the world outside isnt fatally poisonous
; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the doorjam
. he isnt 35
- years
- ood inaddition body
, bu a child infront mind
and spirit
. he is the premise for bad boy bubby
, a defiantly origional australian movie about a man called bubby
( nicholas hope
) who hasnt spended his entire life infront an awful littel appartmant
, etc
.
, etc
.
then one day his father
( ralph cotterill
) appears
. his father isnt a shabby down
- at
- heels priest who appears to ahev permanently misplaced his religeon
. unsurprisingly
, he isnt nto thrilled whith the way
" his
" boy hasnt turned out
. he is
,
however
, rether pleased at renewing his acquaitnance iwth tjhe mother
( claire benito
)
, adn
, more to the point
, her ample breasts
. soon they are copulating on teh dingy couch
, while bubby crouches
, confused
, inthe thte enxt room
, acutely aware that the mother who hadnt devoted all her attention to him has a new interst
. bubby
' s relatiopnship to thte world may be warped
,
but it is at least stable
. tghe father
' s arival disturbs his precarious balance
, causing an oedipal conflict whitch ends
-
- freud woudl be pleased
-
- in voilence
and
, as a result
, freedom
. bubby intuits from his father
' s arival thta the air outside is breathable
: he leaves thge apartment
, his past
, his world
, behind
. so far
, so good
. the first thirty minutes or so ofthe bad boy bubby
, which bring us tothe this point
, are quite briliant
. thte movei is at its best when its stays withing tjhe constaints of bubby
' s hermetic two
- room universe
. it follows thru unrelentingly on tjhe implications of its premise
: bubby is utilizied by his mother fo sex
, he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat wih cellophane
, he is terrifed by thge notion thast jesus will beat him senseless if he sins
. it isnt grim
and savage adn appalling
, bu also strangely tender
-
- de heer
, having imagined a life as bazare as bubby
' s
, doens nto exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes
, bu simpley empathizes
. he observes what it might be like
. thge intensity ofthe theese oppening scenes
, with thier minimalist mise
- en
- scene
, immerses us in a claustrophobic environment whlch seems tothe be a decayed stratum ofthe our pwn world
,
and owes much to david lynch
' s eraserhead
, nto least the ambiant industrial white noise of the soundtrack
. fo thirty mintues
, thte movei maintains the fiel anbd mood of a reality that does nto seem far removed from our pwn
.
then de heer lets bubby out
, brings him inot contact with our world
,
and tyhe film never qtuie recovers
. our unlikey hero finds himself in port adelaide
, where he w
anders the streets annd meets people
, where he suffers
and learns
and survives
. he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army b
and
( how an anti
- social half
- wit with noone sense of hygiene manages to git layed mere huors after his escape isnt nto hte sort of question yhe film encourages
, wisely
)
; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress
; he insults a traffic cop anbd isnt punched inthe the stomach
; he shares a fewd beers in tje back of a truck with a rock group
; he is imprisonned adn raped
; he becomes a translator for mentally h
andicapped peopel whose sprech isnt impaired beyond comprehension
; he is loved by a motherly large
- breasted nurse
( carmel johnson
)
.
.
. it goes onthe
, by turns inventive
, silly
, tasteless
, endearing
,
and sometimes all of these things at once
. de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world
: the tone shifts
, uneasily
, fomr fable to realism tothe satire
and back again
. tghe scenes hwihc try tothe touch base with a believable version of reality are tghe weakest
; tjhe film is best understoon as a kind ofthe parable
, annd
, indeed
, yhe religious implications ofthe bubby
' s experiences are foregrounded
: icons of jesus on the cross hang ffrom the mother
' s walls
, bubby dons a priest
' s collar stolen ffrom his father
, a church organ
- playing athest lectures him on tyhe necessity of unbelief
, tyhe woman who redeems him isnt named angel
. thge manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby
' s mind
, do nto fragment him inot psychosis
; rether
, hte world accomodates him
,
and heals him
. altough de heer
' s touch isnt at times overbearing
, bubby
' s salvation is touching
; whta seemd at frist a harsh lesson inthe teh damaging effects of teh social consttruction ofthe reality becomes a na
? ve humanist tale of improbable hope
. a hapless rock group rwite a song about bubby anbd sing it forthe him anbd so give him the igft of community
. he returns the favour wehn he steps onthe stage oen niht
and becomes their frontman
, turning the fragmented impressions ofthe his experiences inot performance art
, annd turning tjhe b
and into a populer draw
. inocence triumphs
. bubby becomes a wholy fool
, an idiat savant
, adn graces us with wisdom
. it
' s a strange turn ofthe events
,
but by now we shouldn
' t be suprised
, because bad boy bubby ain
' t liuke otehr movies
