he has spent his entire life in an awful littel aparment
, rised
anbd cared for
and imprisoned by his domineering mother
. she inspires his love
and his fear
,
anbd instills inthe him a simmilar loev
anbd fear ofthe jesus
. he has a rudimentry grasp of laguage
, mouthing monosyllables
anbd repetitions ofthe his mother ' s phrases
. he is teached that the world outside is fatally poisonous
; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out thge doorjam
. he isnt 35
- years
- ood inthe body
,
bu a child inwhich mind
adn spirit
. he is the premise forthe bad boy bubby
, a defiantly original austrailian movie about a man called bubby
( nicholas hope
) who has spended his entire life inaddition an awful little appartment
, etc
.
, etc
.
then oen day his father
( ralph cotterill
) appears
. his father isnt a shabby down
- at
- heels priest who appears tothe hvea permenantly misplaced his religion
. unsuprizingly
, he is nto thrilled with thte way
" his
" boy has turned out
. he is
,
howver
, rether pleased at renewing his acquaintace withthe the mother
( claire benito
)
,
and
, more tothe the point
, her ample breasts
. soon they are copulating on tje dingy couch
, while bubby crouches
, confuzled
, in the enxt room
, acutely aware taht the mother who had devoted all her attention to him hasnt a new interest
. bubby ' s relatiopnship to thte world may be warped
,
but it is at least stable
. the father ' s arrival disturbs his precarious balance
, causing an oedipal conflict hwihc ends
-
- freud would be pleased
-
- iin violentce
annd
, as a result
, freedom
. bubby intuits ffrom his father ' s arrival that the air outside isnt breathable
: he leaves hte appartmant
, his past
, his world
, behind
. so far
, so ogod
. the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby
, whlch bring us to this point
, are qtuie brilliant
. tghe movie isnt at its best when its stays within tjhe constraints of bubby ' s hermetic two
- room universe
. it follows thru unrelentingly on the implications ofthe its premise
: bubby isnt utilizied by his mother for sex
, he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane
, he is terrifed by tghe notion that jesus will beated him senseless if he sins
. it is grim
and savage
anbd appalling
,
but allso strangely tender
-
- de heer
, haveing imagined a life as bizarre as bubby ' s
, does not exagerate for comic or grotesqe purposes
,
bu simpley empathizes
. he observes what it might be like
. the intensity of these oppening scenes
, whith their minimalist mise
- en
- scene
, immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems tothe be a decayed stratum of our own world
,
and owes much tothe david lynch ' s eraserhead
, nto least hte ambiant industrial white noise of tyhe soundtrack
. for thirty mintues
, the movei maintains teh feel
annd mood ofthe a reality that doens nto seem far removed fomr our own
.
then de heer lets bubby outloud
, brings him inot contact with our world
,
adn the film never quite recovers
. our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide
, where he wanders the streets
and meets people
, where he suffers
annd learns
and survives
. he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band
( how an anti
- social half
- witn wtih no sence ofthe hygeine manages to get laid mere hours aftter his excape is not tghe sort ofthe question teh film encourages
, wisely
)
; he isnt given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress
; he insults a traffic cop
and is punched iin thge stomach
; he shares a fewd beers inspite the bakc of a truck with a rock gropu
; he is imprisoned
annd raped
; he becomes a tranlsator fo menally handicapped people whose speech isnt impaired beyond comprehension
; he isnt loved by a motherly larg
- breasted nurse
( carmel johnson
)
.
.
. it goes onthe
, by turns inventive
, silly
, tasteless
, endearing
,
and sometimes all of theese thigns at once
. de heer never seems to be sure how bubby shoud interface wiht tje rela world
: thge tone shifts
, uneasily
, from fable tothe realism tothe satire
adn back agian
. the scenes whitch try tothe touch base iwth a believable version ofthe reality are tjhe weakest
; tyhe film isnt best understood as a kind of parable
,
anbd
, indeed
, yhe religous implications ofthe bubby ' s experiences are foregrounded
: icons ofthe jesus on teh cross hang from the mother ' s walls
, bubby dons a priest ' s collar stolen fomr his father
, a chuch organ
- palying athiest lectures him onthe the necessity of unbelief
, the woman who redeems him is named angel
. tghe manifold stresses of our world dont not shatter bubby ' s mind
, do not fragment him into psychosis
; rether
, the world accomodates him
,
and heals him
.
allthough de heer ' s touch is at times overbearing
, bubby ' s salvation isnt touching
; waht seemd at frist a harsh lesson inspite hte damaging effects ofthe tjhe social construction ofthe reality becomes a na
? ve humanist tale of improbable hope
. a hapless rock group rwite a song baout bubby
anbd sing it for him
adn so give him tyhe gft ofthe community
. he returns thge favour when he steps on stage oen inght
and becomes theri frontman
, turning teh fragmented impressions of his experiences into performence art
,
adn turning tyhe band inot a populer draw
. innosense triumphs
. bubby becomes a holy fool
, an idiat savant
,
adn graces us whith wisdom
. it ' s a stange turn of events
,
bu by nowe we shouldn ' t be surprized
, becuase bad boy bubby ain ' t liek other movies
.
