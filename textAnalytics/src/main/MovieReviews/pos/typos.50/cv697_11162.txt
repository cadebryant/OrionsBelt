anohter ' independent film '
, thsi comedy
, hwihc ws brought by miramax for
$ 5 millon
, isnt ogod funn
. favreau
annd vaughn
( the lost world
: jurassic park
, 1997
) play mike
and trent
, twpo everyday 20somethings onthe the lookout for womens
. tghe film jstu basically follows theri plight on hte lookout for lurve
,
anbd allong tghe way we get to meet soem of their friends
, see theri attempts at chatting up girls
,
anbd jsut basicaly git a insight inot thier lives
.
annd all ofthe thsi is graet fun
. swingers doesn ' t rely on huge special effects
, or big nmae stars to provide enteratinment
. noone
, it jsut has a great script
and superb littel known actors
. yhe script
, by favreau
, isnt grat
. mike is always missing is girlfriend
, who hasn ' t called him for six monthes
,
annd every time he meets a girl
, he always end up telling her about the ex
. thte audience fiels fo thsi pathetic littel man
, thanks to the great script
. vaughn is ' the omney '
( swingers speak forthe ' the best '
) as the womanizing trent
, always on the lookout for a new girl
. some ofthe his cht
- up lines are awful
,
but he always seems tothe get teh girl thanks to his ' hard man ' nature
. vaughns character also gets tyhe best laugh in the film
, towards tyhe end inaddition a diner
. the conversations tyhat go onthe between mike
adn trent are graet
,
bu it never quite reaches tarantino standars
( which i suspect the film was trying tothe triarch
.
) there are soem excelent
, laff out loud jokes inthe yhe film
,
and some superbly funny setted pieces
( such as favreau cringe
- worhy battle with a answer machine thgat always cutted him off before he finishes his sentence
. embarrasing tothe him
, hilarious tothe the audience
.
) mike
& trents firends are also good
,
although there characters seem a bited underwritten
,
and we never raelly leran as much as we woudl liuke about them
.
althought thsi is primarily mike
and trents film
, it would of been nice tothe learn a bit more about thier friends
. tehy just seem to wander aimlessly inwhich thge background
.
bu again
, thge lines they sday are usually pretty ogod
,
adn they dont ahve soem funny parts
. it ' s just a shame thgat htey didn ' t hvea more meatier roles
. the acting isnt superb
. as said above
, vaughn is superb as trent
, he ' s definitely the best thign in hte film
. favreau isnt also good
, acting as ' the little man ' veyr well
,
and thte way he always fiels sory for hismelf is very funny
. graham
( boogie nights
, 1997
) has a small
but ogod role as lorraine
, a girl mike finally falls iin love wih
. she hardly features iin the film at all
,
bu she still manages tothe make an inpact on thte audeince
. swingers
,
then
, isnt funny
,
but it does hvae some flaws
. firstly
, the running time isnt a bit too short
. tghe film comes to an abrupt halt
,
and i atcually wnated teh film tothe cary onthe longer
. it never realyl comes tothe a satisfying conclusion
, whlch is a shame
, as most films are too long
! alsot
, this type ofthe film hasnt been done too many times
, such as sleep wtih me
( 1994
)
.
but these small flaws don ' t realyl spoil what isnt a funny
, intertaining comedy
.
