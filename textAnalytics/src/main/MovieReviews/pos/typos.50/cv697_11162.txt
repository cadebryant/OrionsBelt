another
' independent film
'
, tihs comedy
, which ws brang by miramax fo
$ 5 milion
, isnt good fun
. favreau
and vaughn
( the lost world
: jurassic park
, 1997
) play mike
and trent
, twpo everyday 20somethings on thge lookout for womens
. thge film jstu basically follows their plight on yhe lookout fo lurve
,
and allong the way we get tothe meet soem of their friends
, see thier attemts at chatting up girls
,
and jsut basically git a insight inot their lives
.
and all ofthe this is graet fun
. swingers doesn
' t rely onthe huge speical effects
, or big nmae stars to provide enteratinment
. no
, it just hasnt a great script
and superb little known actors
. tghe script
, by favreau
, isnt great
. mike is alwasy missing isnt girlfriend
, who hasn
' t called him fo six months
, annd every time he meets a girl
, he alwasy end up telling her baout the ex
. the audience fiels for thsi pathetic little man
, thanks tothe the gerat scirpt
. vaughn is
' tje money
'
( swingers speak forthe
' the best
'
) as the womanizing trent
, alwyas on the lookout for a newyorker girl
. some of his chat
- uv lines are awful
,
but he alwasy seems tothe get the girl thanks to his
' hard man
' nature
. vaughns character alsot gets tyhe best laff in the film
, towords the end in a diner
. thte conversations that go onthe between mike
and trent are gerat
, bu it never quite reaches tarantino st
andars
( which i suspect the film ws trying to reach
.
) htere are smoe excellent
, laugh out loud jokes in the film
,
and smoe superbly funny setted pieces
( such as favreau cringe
- worhy battle with a answer machine tath alwasy cut him off before he finishes his sentence
. embarrassing tothe him
, hilarious to the audiance
.
) mike
& trents friends are alsot good
,
al
though there cahracters seem a bit underwritten
,
and we never realyl leran as much as we woudl liuke about them
.
al
thought this is primarly mike
and trents film
, it woudl of beeen nice to leran a bited mroe baout their firends
. they just seem to w
ander aimlessly in the backgorund
.
but again
, the lines they say are usually preety ogod
,
and tehy dont hvea soem funny parts
. it
' s just a shame that they didn
' t have omre meatier roles
. thge acting isnt superb
. as said above
, vaughn is superb as trent
, he
' s definitely yhe best hting infact the film
. favreau isnt allso ogod
, acting as
' tyhe littel man
' very well
, annd the way he always feels sorry fo hismelf is vyer funny
. graham
( boogie nights
, 1997
) has a small bu ogod role as lorraine
, a girl mike finally falls inthe lveo whith
. she hardly features inwhich the film at all
,
but she still manages tothe make an inpact on tghe audience
. swingers
,
then
, isnt funny
, bu it doesnt ahev smoe flaws
. firstly
, the runnung time is a bited too short
. tjhe film comes to an abrupt halt
,
and i actulaly wanted the film tothe cary onthe longer
. it never really comes tothe a satisfying conclusion
, whihc isnt a shame
, as most films are too long
! also
, this tipe of film hasnt been done too many times
, such as sleep with me
( 1994
)
.
but these small flaws don
' t raelly spoil wqat isnt a funny
, entertaining comedy
.
