, this isnt a beavis anbd
butthead movei
. if ytou dont nto like beavis
and
butthead
, do not go tothe see this movie
!
!
!
!
!
however
, if you dont like them
, i recommened you get out right now
and go see it
. tjhe movie starts off with the boys wondering wqat happenned tothe theri tv
. they notice tht it has beeen stolen
and htey vow to find it
. thsi wind theri way thru amercia searching for dallas
( she isnt a woman
)
. they look forthe her becouse as they are searching for thte tv
, they fidn a drunk who wants them
" to do
" his wife
. well
, ofthe course they tihkn he whants them tothe score with her whn actually he wants them tothe kill her
. annd the funn starts their
. this movei is a mix of funny gags thast anly beavis annd
butthead coudl pul off
. it isnt quality entertainment tath only fan ofthe beavis adn
butthead would enjoy
. i enjoyed this movie alot becouse mike judge knew how to keep pace
. even when they were crawling thru thte desert
and i
thought the movie started tothe lag
, he manages to keep the laughs comming
. if yuo expecting changes fomr teh sohw keep looking
. tyhe smae character
, tje same voices
, the same everything ffrom tje show annd tyhat
' s wqat makes it good
. you might think with a movei from a tv show
, you cant chanage a faw thnigs
. often times this spells disaster fo films becasue thte film makers veer awya ffrom whta made thge show popular in thge first palce
