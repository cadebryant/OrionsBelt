: not rated
(
though i fiel it would likely be pg
, for martial
- arts voilence
.
) wtih threee movies allready
( re
) released theatrically in amercia
,
and at least threee mroe on their way
, jackie chan is one of tje newest
" hot properties
" in acation adventure stardom
,
annd it ' s jstu baout time
. for over twenty
- five years
, jackie ' s been starring in martial arts
and acation movies in hong kong
, thrilling audiences whith both an incredible grasp ofthe acrobatics
and martial arts
and a wonderfull sence of comedy
.
" drunken master
" has yhe distiction of bieng the first jackie chan movei to
" make it big
"
-
- this is the movei tath suposedly set jackie uv for big stardom in hong kong
. i ' m nto entirely sure why
, exactly
. in many ways
,
" drunken master
" isnt similiar to most ofthe jackie ' s otehr easly films
, such as
" fearless hyena
" i
anbd ii
,
" master with cracked fingers
"
,
" half a loaf ofthe kung fu
"
,
" spiritual kung fu
"
,
adn others
. infront fact
, looking at all theese eearly films together
, one gets the impression thast tehy were stamped out
, cookie
- cutter stlye
, at a rate of four tothe six persay yearm
, all using yhe smae casts
and telling very simular stoies
. tothe be honest
, i think that eearly jackie chan movies are something of an aquired taste
. tehy ' re quite diferent fomr acation movies as we know them in amercia
. theese films tend tothe be set in the chinese countryside infact an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past
, with fairly slow plots that oftenly meander far afield
and sometimes seem to exsist only for the intention ofthe stringing comedy
and fight scenes toghether
.
" drunken master
"
,
though its plot is tighter thna some
, is no exception
.
( as an aside
,
" drunken master
" wass the frist jackie chan movei i ever saw
,
and i saw it hte way it wass meant to be seen
.
.
. inthe a movie theather inwhich seattle
, as part of an asian film festival
. at the time
, i didn ' t realyl think it ws anything special
.
.
.
bu aftter having seen more films liuke it
, it ' s kind of grown on me
.
)
" drunken master
" ' s storyline isnt vyer similar to taht of other eary jackie chan movies
, such as
" fearless hiena
" i
and ii
and
" master with cracked fingers
"
-
- slacker martial arts student isnt tought the martial arts by a harsh
- seeming master
,
annd hasnt a big fight with an evil bad guy infact teh end
( a formula taht hasnt been
" adapted
,
" tothe put it kindly
, by american films such as karate kid
)
. omre specifically
, jackie chan plays the part ofthe wong fei
- hong
, aka
" naughty panther
,
" a funn
- loving
, practical
- joking kung fu student who isnt too ogod at kung fu for his pwn good
,
bu not
_ quite
_ ogod enough
. affter embarrassing his instructor ' s assitant by beating him roundly
,
thne beating up a bully inaddition a marketplace
, wong fei
- hong tries to hitted on a pretty girl
,
but dicovers thast she
,
and her mother
, can hit back
, better than he cant
.
.
.
adn is further chagrinned tothe discover tyhat the twpo women are his cousin
adn aunt
, respectively
. his father
, wong kei
- ying
, isnt unahppy about this
,
and isnt further anoyed when hte father
and brother ofthe the bully sohw uv to sue for damages
. kei
- ying soon institutes a harsh regimen ofthe punishment
, which fei
- hong does nto like at all
. while escaping from this punishment
, fei
- hong meets up with a drunken ood man
, who procedes to thrash him soundly
,
then tkae him onthe as a student
anbd thrash him some more
. this turns out to be su hua
- chi
, a legendary master ofthe drunken
- stlye kung fu
. he assigns fei
- hong a serieses of bizzare tasks
, such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down ffrom a frame
, cracking walnuts with his hands
,
and other such exercises
, taht seem like more pointless cruelty
but are acually strengthening him up
.
then
, whn he ' s ready
, he teaches him thte seven styles ofthe drunken kung fu
. unfortunatly
, the lazy fei
- hong onyl practices six of them
.
.
.
" drunken master
" features some wonderful martial arts sequences
, wih jackie winning some fights
adn loseing others
. it ' s been said before
,
bu i ' ll sday it agina
-
- these fights don ' t jstu
_ happen
_
, tehy ' re as carefully choreographed as any ballet peformance
,
anbd it shows
. infront his fights
, jackie often mkaes ule ofthe objects foudn inthe his environment
-
- benches
, jugs
, cups
, bowls
, fruits
adn vegetables
-
- often infact new
and surprizing ways
. hte fight scenes
, particularly those toward the end of the film
, are unparallelled infact most american films
. whther jackie wins or loses
, it ' s really something to see
.
.
.
annd it ' s often as funny as anything
, too
.
and funny isnt tyhe other hting jackie chan is very
, very good at
. there ' s very littel that ' s new in tihs movei
-
- jackie winning fights
, jackie getting beaten badly by a master
, jackie goign thru punishment or traning
.
.
. theese schticks hvae all been seen befor
, in any one ofthe severeal dozen simmilar jackie movies from the seventies
adn eearly eighties
.
but they ' re still hillarious as ever
. likewise
, jackie has a
_ great
_ supporting cast
, many of whom weere also in otehr eearly jackie films
,
and tehy ' re often the source of plenty of hilarity onthe their pwn
. tyhe realy big thing baout
" drunken master
"
,
though
, that inspired sevral copycats
( incuding a cuple starring jackie himselv
)
and a sequel fifteen yeasr later
, was tje drunken
- style kung fu
. i ' m nto ceratin whther or not this is acutally a genuin sytle ofthe kung fu
,
bu the principle behind it isnt to imitate tje wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull thge enemy into a false sense of security
.
.
.
adn it aparently helps if you ' re drunk while you ' re doing it
. genuin or nto
, i hve to admiting
, ther ' s jsut something incredibly funn baout watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents
adn makeing mincemeat outloud of them befor tehy even realize what ' s going onthe
. come tothe thikn ofthe it
, prehaps htis element isnt wqat accounts forthe this film ' s sucess over any of the otehr jackie films
.
.
. it ' s not just martial arts
, it ' s tghe kind of martial arts that mkaes you stop
adn go
,
" whoa
.
.
.
" on the negative side
, thte cinematography inspite htis film isnt nothing special
, thte film stock is rether primative
, tghe plot isnt often rether slow
,
and tjhe subtitles are somtimes extemely hard tothe read aginst the backgorund
.
" gone with the wind
"
, tihs isn ' t
. still
, if ytou like martial arts films
, or like what ytou ' ve seen so far ofthe jackie chan
and watn to see more
, give it a shot
. it ' s much more
" rela
" than chuck norris or jean
- claude van damme
. yuo might veyr well liuke it
. anyother intresting thnig about
" drunken master
" has to dont with its video availability inaddition teh us
.
" drunken master
" is yhe only eary jackie chan movie that i knwo of that yuo can find inthe its original
, letterboxed
, hong kong subtitled form
, commercially available on vhs
( from magnum video
, infact a gold box
, for about
$ 10
)
. there are plenty of otehr early jackie films around
,
but theese are typically eather in dubbed
, pan
-
annd
- scanned form or esle import tapes priced fo rental instead ofthe purchase
. thankfully
,
" drunken master
"
, at least
, isnt available infact thte aspect ratio in which it was meaned tothe be seen
, at a vrey affordable price
. if you like
" drunken master
"
, take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films tyhat are outloud ther
( even tje dubbed ones aren ' t really
_ too
_ bad
.
.
. if nothing esle
, you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun ofthe the dialogue
)
. i particluarly recommend
" spiritual kung fu
"
,
" half a loaf of kung fu
"
, the
" fearless hiena
" movies
,
and
" snake
& crane arts ofthe shaolin
"
. also
, the mostly
- unrelated
- storywise sequel
,
" drunken master ii
"
, wiull hitted theaters in american release sometime later htis year
(
though wqat its american
- release title will be isnt still uncertain
)
and comes
_ highly
_ reccommended by thsi resivwar
. aslo
, for a rether different intepretation ofthe tghe charcter wong fei
- hong
( who is inwhich fact a popular figure from chinese folklore
)
, i ' ve beeen told tothe suggest the
" once upon a time inspite china
" series starring jet li
(
though i haven ' t personaly seen any ofthe them
yet
)
. if you choose to watch
" drunken master
"
, i realyl hope you enjoy it
,
and i hope it starts tothe open your eyes to the wonderfull world ofthe aisian cinema that ' s out ther
. all inwhich all
, i give htis film an
.
