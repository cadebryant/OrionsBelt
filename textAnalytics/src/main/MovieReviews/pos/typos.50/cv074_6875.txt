(
though i feel it woudl likely be pg
, for martial
- arts violence
.
) with three movies already
( re
) released theatrically inthe america
,
and at least threee more on theri way
, jackie chan is oen ofthe the newest
" hot properties
" inwhich action adventure stardom
, annd it
' s just baout time
. forthe over twenty
- five yeasr
, jackie
' s been starring infront martial arts
and acation movies inspite hong kong
, thrilling audiences with both an incredable grasp ofthe acrobatics
and martial arts annd a wonderfull sence ofthe comedy
.
" drunken master
" has tghe distinction ofthe bieng the first jackie chan movie tothe
" amking it big
"
-
- tihs is teh movie that suposedly set jackie uv for big stardom in hong kong
. i
' m not entirely sure why
, exactlly
. in many ways
,
" drunken master
" is similar to most of jackie
' s otehr eary films
, such as
" fearless hyena
" i
and ii
,
" master whith cracked fingers
"
,
" half a loaf of kung fu
"
,
" spiritual kung fu
"
,
and others
. infact fact
, looking at all theese eary films together
, one gets teh impression thta tehy weere stamped outloud
, cookie
- cutter style
, at a rate ofthe four to six per year
, all useing the smae casts
and telling very similar stories
. tothe be honest
, i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an aquired tast
. they
' re qtuie differnt from acation movies as we know them in amercia
. theese films tend to be setted in tje chinese countryside infact an indeterminate period sometime inspite the distant past
, with fairly slow plots thta oftenly me
ander far afield annd somtimes seem tothe exsist only forthe hte intention of stringing comedy anbd fight scenes together
.
" drunken master
"
,
though its plot isnt tighter tahn some
, isnt no exception
.
( as an asside
,
" drunken master
" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw
,
and i saw it teh way it wass meaned to be seen
.
.
. infact a movei theater infront seattle
, as part of an aisian film festival
. at tyhe time
, i didn
' t really htikn it was anytying special
.
.
. bu affter having seen moreso films like it
, it
' s kind of grown onthe me
.
)
" drunken master
"
' s storyline isnt very similar to thyat ofthe other easly jackie chan movies
, such as
" fearless hiena
" i adn ii adn
" master wtih cracked fingers
"
-
- slacker martial arts student is taught teh martial arts by a harsh
- seeming master
,
and hasnt a big fight whith an evil bad guy in the end
( a formula thta hasnt been
" adapted
,
" to put it kindly
, by american films such as karate kid
)
. more specifically
, jackie chan plays the part of wong fei
- hong
, aka
" naughty panther
,
" a fun
- loving
, practial
- joking kung fu student who is too ogod at kung fu fo his own ogod
, bu nto
_ quite
_ good enough
. aftter embarrassing his instructer
' s assitant by beating him roundly
,
then beating up a bully infact a marketplace
, wong fei
- hong tries tothe hit on a preety girl
, bu discovers thgat she
, anbd her mother
, can hitted back
, better thna he can
.
.
. anbd isnt further chagrinned tothe discover that the twpo womens are his cousin adn aunt
, respectively
. his father
, wong kei
- ying
, isnt unhappy baout this
, anbd isnt further annoyed wehn the father anbd brother of the bully sohw uv to sue for damages
. kei
- ying soon institutes a harsh regimen ofthe punishment
, which fei
- hong doens not liuke at all
. hwile escaping from htis punishment
, fei
- hong meets up with a drunken ood man
, who procedes to thrash him soundly
, thn tkae him onthe as a student
and thrash him some more
. htis turns outloud to be su hua
- chi
, a legendary master ofthe drunken
- style kung fu
. he assigns fei
- hong a series of bizarre tasks
, such as filling jugs whith water while hanging upside down from a frame
, cracking walnuts wiht his h
ands
,
and other such exercises
, that seem liek moreso pointless cruelty
but are actully strenghening him uv
.
then
, whn he
' s ready
, he teaches him tje seven styles of drunken kung fu
. unfortunatly
, hte lazy fei
- hong onyl practices six of them
.
.
.
" drunken master
" features smoe wonderfull martial arts sequences
, wtih jackie winning smoe fights
and loosing others
. it
' s been said befoer
, bu i
' ll say it agian
-
- theese fights don
' t jsut
_ hapen
_
, htey
' re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance
, anbd it shows
. inaddition his fights
, jackie often makse use of objects found in his environment
-
- benchs
, jugs
, cups
, bowls
, fruits
and vegitables
-
- often in new annd surprizing ways
. the fight scenes
, particlarly thsoe towrad the end ofthe thte film
, are unparallelled in most american films
. whther jackie wins or loses
, it
' s raelly something tothe see
.
.
.
and it
' s oftenly as funny as anytying
, too
. annd funny isnt thge otehr hting jackie chan is very
, vyre ogod at
. there
' s very littel thast
' s newyorker in tihs movei
-
- jackie winning fights
, jackie getting beaten badly by a master
, jackie gogin through punishment or traning
.
.
. these schticks hve all been seen before
, infront any one ofthe sevral dozen similiar jackie movies from hte seventies anbd eary eighties
. bu they
' re still hilarious as ever
. likewise
, jackie hasnt a
_ gerat
_ supporting casted
, many of whom were aslo iin otehr easly jackie films
,
and tehy
' re oftenly the source of plenty ofthe hilarity on theri pwn
. hte really big hting about
" drunken master
"
,
though
, taht inpsired sevral copycats
( including a couple starring jackie himselv
)
and a sequel fifteen yersa later
, was the drunken
- style kung fu
. i
' m nto certian whther or nto tihs is atcually a genuin style of kung fu
,
but the principle behind it is to immitate tjhe wobbly movements ofthe a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sence ofthe security
.
.
. annd it aparently helps if you
' re drunk while yuo
' re doing it
. genuine or not
, i hvae tothe admited
, there
' s jstu something incredibly funn baout watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading inot a gropu ofthe startled opponents
and makeing mincemeat outloud of them befoer htey even realize what
' s going onthe
. come to think of it
, perhaps this element isnt what accounts fo tihs film
' s success over any of the otehr jackie films
.
.
. it
' s not just martial arts
, it
' s tghe kind of martial arts that mkaes you stop adn go
,
" whoa
.
.
.
" onthe the negative side
, tyhe cinematography in htis film isnt nothing speshal
, the film stock is rather primitive
, thge plot isnt often rather slow
, annd teh subtitles are sometimes extrememly hard tothe read against teh background
.
" gone withthe thte wind
"
, tihs isn
' t
. still
, if ytou liek martial arts films
, or like what yuo
' ve seen so far ofthe jackie chan anbd whant to see moreso
, give it a shot
. it
' s much omre
" real
" than chuck norris or jean
- claude van damme
. yuo might very well liuke it
. anyother intresting thign about
" drunken master
" hasnt to dont with its video availablity iin the us
.
" drunken master
" isnt the onyl eary jackie chan movei thyat i konw ofthe tath yuo can find inaddition its orginial
, letterboxed
, hong kong subtitled form
, commercially available on vhs
( from magnum video
, infront a gold box
, forthe about
$ 10
)
. there are plenty ofthe otehr eearly jackie films around
, bu these are typically eather in dubbed
, pan
- adn
- scanned form or else import tapes priced fo rental instade ofthe prchase
. thankfully
,
" drunken master
"
, at least
, is avilable inwhich the aspect ratio inspite which it was meant to be seen
, at a very affordable price
. if you like
" drunken master
"
, tkae a look at the numberous otehr early jackie chan films that are out htere
( even the dubbed ones aren
' t really
_ too

" half a loaf of kung fu
"
, tyhe
" fearless hyena
" movies
,
and
" snake
& crane arts ofthe shaolin
"
. also

- storywise sequal
,
" drunken master ii
"
, iwll hitted theaters in american realease sometime later thsi yera
(
though what its american
- realease title will be isnt still uncertain
) anbd comes
_ highly
_ recommended by tihs resivwar
. also
, fo a rether different interpretation of yhe charater wong fei
- hong
( who is in fatc a populer figure fomr chinese folklore
)
, i
' ve been told to suggest the
" once upon a tyme in china
" serieses starring jet li
(
