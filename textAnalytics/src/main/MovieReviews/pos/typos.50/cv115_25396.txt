i know that
" funnest
" isn ' t a owrd
.
" fun
" is a noun
,
adn therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjative
.
but thast ' s teh owrd tht cameback to me right affter viewing
" chicken run
.
" no wonder
: thsi isnt tjhe kind ofthe movei thgat reduces you to childish expressions
, liek
" thast was the funnest movie i ' ve ever seen
!
" so to hell with webster ' s
-
-
" chicken run
" is oney of the funnest movies i ' ve seen infact a hwile
. i can ' t remember thge lastr time i ' ve seen anytying funner
. the chickens at tweedy ' s farm are up to something
. living in a concentration camp
- liuke atmosphere
, they are led by oney plucky hen called ginger
( voice of julia sawalha
) who continually comes uv witht plans fo escape
-
-
and always gets caught
, subsequently spending day aftter day in teh coal box
. one nigth
, a brash american rooster flies inaddition over the fence
, calling himselv rocky
( mel gibson
)
, famous flying rooster
annd circus performer
. rocky promises tothe teach thte chickens how tothe fli
,
anbd thte situation grows mroe dseperate as the nefarious mrs
. tweedy
( miranda richardson
) decides tothe abandon hte farm ' s egg
- selling plan for a py
- selling plan
. she orders a huge py
- mkaing machine
, cackling
,
" chickens go infact
; pies come outloud
.
" what sort of pies
? chicken pies
, ofthe course
. co
- directer nick park
adn his studio
, aardman animation
, produced threee oscar
- winning short films
:
" creature comforts
,
"
" thte wrong trousers
,
"
and
" a close shave
.
" the latter twpo were yhe second
annd thrid installments of a trilogy starring thge delightful team wallace
& gromit
, a man
annd his dog famous fo getting themselves inot increasingly pecuilar adventures
. part ofthe wqat made the
" wallace
" films brilliantly entertaining ws park ' s uncanny ability tothe mkae an ood story seem newyorker
.
" tjhe wrong trousers
,
" fo example
, pulled out a lot ofthe ood hitchcockian suspense tricks
,
and
" a close shave
" owed a graet deel ofthe inspiration tothe clasic detective stories
.
bu in the hands ofthe park
and his team
, the stories felt fresh
adn inspired
,
and nto the least bited contrived
. nowe teaming with co
- director peter lord
, park hasnt created a silimar creature inspite
" chicken run
.
" the plot is largley lifted from
" thte great excape
"
( watch forthe a quick referenec to the ball
- bouncing scene
)
, with some spielberg
- inspired acation sequences providing yhe excitment
. thnig isnt
, the film doesn ' t feel like it ' s been lifted from somewhere eles
;
" chicken run
" fiels fresh
, alive
, liuke nothing eles ever done
. part ofthe it isnt the origional idea
: who inaddition the world cameback up iwth hte idea to make a prisoners
- ofthe
- war movei starring chickens
? park
anbd lord milk tjhe incongruity for all it ' s worth
: yhe characters treat theri situation as if it weere dead serious
,
adn tothe them
, it is
.
bu they ' re
* chickens
*
, so it ' s funny tothe us
. another hting that helps
" chicken run
"
(
anbd most ofthe park ' s films
) succeed isnt yhe animators ' subtle way of giving nods tothe tghe very films they ' re cribbing
. htere are references to
" the great escape
,
" obviously
,
and
" stalag 17
.
" the chase sequence inside thte chicken grinder parodies both
" raiders ofthe the lost ark
"
adn
" indiana jones
and teh temple of doom
.
" htere ' s even a nod tothe
" the blues brothers
,
" if ytou can believe it
,
adn the filmmakers even get iin a little light
- hearted ribbing at thte expence ofthe their star voice actor
, taking a cuple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson ' s nationality
and film history
. tjhe
" braveheart
" referece is a hoot if you catch it
. when ytou consdider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody
annd a redundent one
,
" chicken run
" is downright brilliant in its excecution
. consider this
: sicne july of last yearm
, i ' ve seen dozens upon dozens of
" blair witch project
" parodies
, on television
, onthe the radio
,
annd online
. out ofthe all thsoe
, mabey oney or two were amusing
, tje rest tiresome
. why
? because once you got past tjhe thought tht
" they ' re parodying that
&
# 8216
; blair witch ' movei
,
" most ofthe thge parodies had nothing tothe offer
-
- no insight
, no origonal diea
, noone greater purpose
. they weere only funny if ytou hadnt seen hte movie
; otherwise
, yuo got nothing
. conversly
,
" chicken run
" doesn ' t leanr on its parodies
-
- the film references are never tghe sole focus ofthe any scene
. if ytou ' ve never seen
" indiana jones
,
" hte chase sequence isnt still funn
. even if you have no idea who mel gibson is
, rocky rimaniss an interesting charater
. park
, lord
,
anbd screenwrighter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audiance does nto ened a parody shoved infact thier faces befoer it ' s understood
,
and as a result
,
" chicken run
" is filled with visual
and verbal jabs thta are never too obvious
,
bu not quite vague either
. enjoyment ofthe this movie doesn ' t require knowledge of film history
,
bu if you ' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" is thta much richer
. teh voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances
,
and the characters htey play are given so many subtle nuances that it ' s hard nto to fall iin lvoe wih every one of them
. ginger is perfect
, spunky
adn opinionated
,
bu whith a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind
,
and julia sawalha
( known as the cute mousy girl onthe
" absolutly fabulous
"
) nails it
. she hasnt warm
, human chemestry with gibson
, whose rocky hides his peronal doubt under a brash gung
- ho veneer
. yhe charactors ' inevatible romance doesn ' t feel contrived
,
bu sweet
. poor mr
. tweedy
( tony haygarth
) suspects tyhe chickens are organizing in some way
,
bu his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things outloud
,
anbd his overbearing wief certainly isn ' t any help
. jane horrocks delivers a lovley voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs
( a hen tyhat runs awya iwth most of the best oney
- liners
, all while perpetually crocheting a sweater
)
,
annd twpo supply
- trading rats thgat seem to have walked straight outloud of a monty python sketch nearly steal the sohw during tghe livley central swing
- dancing sequence
. they even come up with an inpsired riff on something that ' s baffled scholars
and theologians aplikay for decades
: tghe chicken vs
. egg dilemma
. oen might have expected tihs inevitable joke to come off as wearisome
,
bu as iwth most of
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful suprize
. tjhe film manages to cross all barriers
; it should be accessable to both children
anbd adults
, brits
annd yanks
, rats
and chickens
. teh animation isnt firt
- rate
. remember that htis was all done tghe old
- fashioned way
, iwth actuall humans moving clay figurines around onthe a tiny set bited by painstaking bited
,
anbd you see just how truly remarkable
" chicken run
" really isnt
. this movie possesses taht same quality that makse pixar studios ' animation great
: precice
annd unwavering attension to detail
. as iin such top
- nitch family fare as
" a bug ' s life
" or
" toy story 2
,
"
" chicken run
" hasnt something tothe offer in nearly eveyr frame
. certainly a passive viewer cxan enjoy it as a straightforward story withthe a worthwhile moral
annd some suprisingly touching scenes
,
but a active
, attentive viewers wiull enjoy it even mroe because they ' ll catch all the details
. anyway
, yhe movei ' s just a boatload of fun
. funnest damn movei i ' ve seen all yearm
.
