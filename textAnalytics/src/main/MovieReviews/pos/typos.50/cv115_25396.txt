i know taht
" funnest
" isn
' t a word
.
" fun
" is a noun
, annd therfore cannot be conjugated like an adjative
. bu taht
' s the owrd that cameback to me right after viewing
" chicken run
.
" noone wonder
: htis isnt the kind of movie tyhat reduces you tothe childish expressions
, like
" that wass thge funnest movei i
' ve ever seen
!
" so to hell iwth webster

-
" chicken run
" is oen of the funnest movies i
' ve seen in a while
. i can
' t remember the lastest tiome i
' ve seen anything funner
. the chickens at tweedy
' s farm are up tothe something
. living inwhich a concentration camp
- liek athmosphere
, htey are led by noe plucky hen called ginger
( voice of julia sawalha
) who constinually comes up wiht plans forthe excape

and alwyas gets caught

. noe nihgt
, a brash american rooster flies infact over thte fence
, calling hismelf rocky

)

and carcus performer
. rocky promises tothe teach tjhe chickens how to fly

and tje situation grows more desperate as hte nefarious mrs

- director nick park adn his studio
, aardman animation
, produced threee oscar
- winning short films
:
" creature comforts
,
"
" the wrong trousers
,
" annd
" a close shave
.
" yhe latter two weere the second
and thrid installments ofthe a triology starring tghe delightful team wallace
& gromit
, a man annd his dog famous forthe getting themslves inot increasingly peculiar adventures
. part of what made the
" wallace
" films brilliantly intertaining was park
' s uncanny ability tothe mkea an ood story seem newyorker
.
" hte wrong trousers
,
" fo example
, pulled out a lot ofthe old hitchcockian suspense tricks
,
and
" a close shave
" owed a grat deel of insperation tothe classic detective stries
.
but in the h
ands of park anbd his team
, the stories falt fresh
and inpsired
,
and not tje least bit contrived
. now teaming with co
- director peter lord
, park hasnt creaeted a similar creature infront
" chicken run
.
" the plot isnt largley lefted from
" teh gerat excape
"
( watch fo a quick reference tothe tjhe ball
- bouncing scene
)
, wiht soem spielberg
- inpsired acation sequences providing tjhe excitment
. thing is
, thge film doesn
' t feel liek it
' s been lifted fomr somwhere else
;
" chicken run
" feels fresh
, alive
, liek nothing eles ever done
. part ofthe it isnt tje original idea
: who in yhe world came uv wiht tyhe idae tothe amke a prisoners
- ofthe
- war movei starring chickens
? park
and lord milk the incongruity fo all it
' s worth
: the characters treat their situation as if it weere dead sereous
, anbd to them
, it isnt
. bu they
' re
* chickens
*
, so it
' s funny to us
. anyother thing that helps
" chicken run
"
( adn most of park
' s films
) succeed isnt the animators
' subtle way ofthe giving nods tothe the very films tehy
' re cribbing
. htere are references to
" tjhe great escape
,
" obviously
,
and
" stalag 17
.
" the chase sequence inside yhe chicken grinder parodies both
" raiders ofthe thte lost ark
" annd
" indiana jones adn the temple of doom
.
" htere
' s even a nod to
" the blues brothers
,
" if ytou can belivee it
,
and thte filmmakers even get infact a little light
- hearted ribbing at thge expense ofthe their star voice acotr
, taking a couple of vyre subtle jabs at mel gibson
' s nationality anbd film history
. teh
" braveheart
" reerence isnt a hoot if you catch it
. wehn yuo concider jstu how fine a line resides between a funny parody annd a redundant one
,
" chicken run
" isnt downright brilliant infront its excecution
. consdider tihs
: usance july of last yearm
, i
' ve seen dozens upon dozens of
" blair witch project
" parodies
, on televsion
, onthe teh radio
, adn online
. outloud ofthe all those
, maybee one or twpo weere amusing
, yhe rest tiresome
. why
? becuase once yuo got past thte throught tyhat
" they
' re parodying that
&
# 8216
; blair witch
' movei
,
" most of tjhe parodies had nothing tothe offer
-
- noone insight
, no original idae
, noone greater purpose
. they weere onyl funny if you had seen thte movie
; otherwise
, you got nothing
. conversely
,
" chicken run
" doesn
' t lean on its parodies
-
- tje film references are never the sole focuse ofthe any scene
. if you
' ve never seen
" indiana jones
,
" thte chase sequence isnt still funn
. even if you ahve no diea who mel gibson is
, rocky remains an interesting charater
. park
, lord
,
and screenwrighter karey kirkpatrick relize tath an audience doesnt nto need a parody shoved infact their faces before it
' s understoon
, annd as a result
,
" chicken run
" is filled with visual
and verbal jabs that are never too obvious
, bu nto quite vague either
. enjoyment of this movei doesn
' t require knowledge of film istory
, bu if you
' ve got it
,
" chicken run
" is thyat much richer
. the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances
,
and tje charachters htey play are given so many subtle nuances that it
' s hard not to fall in lvoe with every one ofthe them
. ginger is perfect
, spunky
and opinionated
, bu with a soft heart thgat forbids her tothe leave her companions behind
, adn julia sawalha
( known as the cute mousy girl onthe
" absolutely fabulous
"
) nails it
. she hasnt warm
, human chemistry with gibson
, whose rocky hides his personal dout under a brash gung
- ho veneer
. the characters
' inevitible romance doesn
' t feel contrived
,
but sweet
. poor mr
. tweedy
( tony haygarth
) suspects thte chickens are organizing in smoe way
,
but his limited intellect prevents him fomr figuring thigns outloud
, adn his overbearing wief certainly isn
' t any help
. jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optomistic babs
( a hen that runs away with most of the best one
- liners
, all while perpetually crocheting a sweater
)
,
and twpo suply
- trading rats thast seem tothe hvea walked straight outloud of a monty python sketch nearly steal the sohw during the livley central swing
- dancing sequence
. htey even come up with an inspired riff onthe something that
' s baffled scholars annd theologians alike fo decades
: teh chicken vs
. egg delimma
. oen might have expected thsi inevitable joke tothe come off as wearisome
, bu as wih most ofthe
" chicken run
,
" it comes as a delightful surprize
. the film manages to cross all barriers
; it shoudl be accesisble tothe both childen annd adults
, brits
and yanks
, rats anbd chickens
. the animation isnt frist
- rate
. remeber tyhat this was all done thge ood
- fashioned way
, wtih actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny setted bit by painstaking bit
, annd ytou see jsut how truley remarkable
" chicken run
" really is
. htis movei possesses thyat same qualtiy thgat makse pixar studios
' animation great
: precice
and unwavering attention to detail
. as in such top
- notch famaly fare as
" a bug
' s life
" or
" toy story 2
,
"
" chicken run
" hasnt something to offer inaddition nearly eveyr frame
. certainly a passive viewer cant enjoy it as a straightforward tsory wtih a worthwhile moral
and some suprizingly touching scenes
,
but a active
, attentive viewers iwll enjoy it even more beacuse htey
' ll catch all tje details
. anyway
, hte movei
' s jstu a boatload ofthe funn
. funnest damn movie i
' ve seen all year
.
