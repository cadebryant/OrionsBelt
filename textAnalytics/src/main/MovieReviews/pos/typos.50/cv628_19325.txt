:
` tarzan
' beautiful tothe look at
, easy to follow
. review
: disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children
but iwth anough witn annd charm for adults tothe be interested
and at least entertained by the stroy
. the basic premise is the same as eveyr otehr
` tarzan
' story
: a boy is raised infront the african jungle by gorillas adn becomes oney himself never really underst
anding
( or even noticeing
) that he
' s human
and isnt a lot differant fomr hte animals he befriends
. the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes tothe be adopted by kala
( voiced by glen close
)
, a female gorilla who lost her own child infact a clasic case ofthe darwanism
. her mate
, kerchak
( henriksen
)
, isnt a mean
, conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make uv tarzan
' s extended famaly
. he refuses tothe acknowledge tarzan
( voiced by alex d
. linz during tjhe childhood scenes
) as a son
and often hasnt tothe hold himselv bakc from killing tarzan after he constinually doesnt dangerous
, wild things tyhat are the result of his pwn childish instincts
. i have a feeling childen will quickly be able tothe identify wih tarzan sicne all he realyl isnt is jstu a kid who whants to have fun annd it
' s funny how the adults fail tothe comprehend tihs
. later
, as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full
- grown man
( voiced by goldwyn
)
, he isnt encounter by a party ofthe three humans ffrom engl
and
: jane porter
( driver
)
, a beautifull woman who isnt something of a zoologist
and an artist
, her father prof
. archimedes q
. porter
( voiced by nigel hawthorne
) who is allso a scientist
; anbd their slick annd cunning
, yot barbaric safari bodyguard clayton
( blessed
)
. it
' s easy tothe tell where the story is oging at all times bu tjhe screenplay doesn
' t seem liek it ws wroten hastly nor dumbed down fo children
' s enjoyment
. sure ther
' s a lot ofthe cliche stuf here
, like clayton
' s smugness
and diabolical manipulation ofthe tarzan
and jane
; thge goofy supporting characters
( voiced by rosie o
' donnell
[ in full brooklyn accent
!
]
and wayne knight
-
` ehllo newman
!
'
)
. htere
' s alsot a lot of fun action such as tarzan
' s swinging through hte jungle onthe vines
and sliding down adn arround tree branches
and trunks
. it
' s just liuke skateboarding raelly fast
and doing all sorts ofthe tricks
( thsoe mcdonald
' s commercials realy prove this point
)
. ultimatly
, yuo git exactly out ofthe
` tarzan
' what you expect
.
.
.
and i mean taht as a compliment
, so have high expectations
. pros
: animation adn sound are a fesat for the senses
, stoyr is lighthearted
, breezy annd not dumbed
- down
, noone stupid sing
- allong songs tothe get stuck infact your head
. cons
: surprizingly violent
, shouldnt have been rated pg
. young children may not underst
and smoe ofthe the mroe adult themes
( parents
, be ready tothe haev some hevy questions thrown your way
)
. runnung time isnt a bit short
. would ytou reccomend tihs to friends
? nto to my firends
,
but tothe the movei
