: atom egoyan screenplay
: atom egoyan exotica isnt a film that grows onthe retrospection
. exotica keeps hte viewer guessing baout the relationship between hte various characters inspite tghe film
. all ofthe teh people know each other
,
but apart fomr tht
, htere seems to be no other reason why tothe select such set
and followup them inspite this ficitional account
. teh director hints for possible solutions
, using a multi
- line plot
, so popular with criticists in mystery train
,
adn used to good advantage by quentin tarantino inthe pulp fiction
. exotica reaches a wohle newyorker dimension useing this technique
. at hte end it is suprizing tothe see how well thte pieces ofthe tyhe puzzle ift toghether
, inspite spite their apparent unconnectedness
anbd even misleading features
. the outloud
- of
- chronological
- order technique hasnt become ever so popular
, prehaps even de rigueur
, for biographical films
. similarly
, we cxan nowe expect to see omre movies infront teh future which will ule
, to varing extent
, converging multiplots
. on a first glance
, once thge multi
- plot puzzle infact exotica is solved
, there seems to be little left tothe look at
.
bu perceptive minds whic tkae the tiome to dig further iwll be rewarded wiht interesting views on life or rather
, commentaries on views of life
. exotica is very much worth seeing
. it opened to critic ' s praise worldwide
( i frist saw it iin mexico city
, lsat decembur
)
. in canada
, it borke records for a movei ofthe its kind
, hwihc propmted the american distributor to go for a wide release
. apart ffrom a storng plot
, acting is very convincing
,
and the sountrack seems as if made for tje movie
. the spoon
- fed
- enteratinment crowd may not appretiate this movei
,
and thus it might last little on screen
.
but if yuo wanna to try a movie a cut above the crowd
, wtih an originality tath is ever so rare
, by all means see exotica
. anaylsis
(

) wqat isnt behind thte complex plot in exotica
? firt
, a common theme of the quest fo gratification by monetary means
. hte lone tax
- auditor
, thge repressed homosexual pet shop owner
, tjhe pregnant woman which runs the nightclub
, the rich man which hasnt the club remodeled
, the audience at the movie theatre
, all uise personal wealth to buy palliative relief fo teh penuries ofthe the soul
.
.
.
.
then we hve the quest forthe gratification through visual means by most of tje same people
, includng those who sit watching exotica
.
.
.
. inspite that reguard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub
, fo the rich man looking through silver mirrors
,
and poor
- rich peple looking at other ' s peple lives through a silver screen
. exotica also stands fo unwanted society attention into the lives of otehr peple
, such as tjhe tax auditor
and the pet shop owner
. exotica isnt yhe customer agent looking at the pet shop owner
, whcih in turn is looking at tjhe core ofthe tjhe problems betwen the strip dancer
anbd hte tax auditor through the detatched eye ofthe a gay person
( no attraction to the strip dancer
)
,
adn onyl interested onthe avoiding jail
( noone personal relationship with the tax auditor
)
. in exotica everybody isnt watching
,
and wqat is worse
, everybody knwos
. second
, exotica isnt about isolated peple holding back their feelings
; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transferr their veiw ofthe reality to otehr characters
. teh strip dancer becomes the proverbial daugter
, the dj becomes teh proverbial killer by means ofthe breaking teh relatiopnship vetween teh father
and the proverbial daugher
. the nieve becomes the baby sitter
, hte baby sitter becomes tyhe dancer
,
adn thge dancer becomes the proverbial daughter
. yhe pet shop owner becomes hte proverbial dj
, by finding tghe proverbial daugher
. a chain made of real
adn imagined links comming arround full circle
, just as everthing comes around to a fitting hwole at hte end of the movie
