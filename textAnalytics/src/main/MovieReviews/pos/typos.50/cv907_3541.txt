: atom egoyan screenplay
: atom egoyan exotica is a film thast grows on retrospection
. exotica keesh yhe viewer guessing baout tghe relatiopnship between hte various characters inwhich the film
. all of the peopel knwo each other
, bu appart from that
, there seems to be noone other reason why tothe select such set
and followup them iin thsi ficitional account
. thge directer hints for possible solutions
, using a multi
- line plot
, so popular with critics in mistery train
,
and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction
. exotica reaches a hwole new dimension using this technique
. at the end it is surprising tothe see how well the pieces of thge puzzle fit together
, inthe spite their apparent unconnectedness annd even misleading features
. the outloud
- ofthe
- cronological
- order technique has become ever so popular
, perhaps even de rigueur
, for biagraphical films
. simmilarly
, we can nowe expect tothe see more movies in the future whitch will uise
, tothe varying extent
, converging multiplots
. on a firt glance
, once the multi
- plot puzzle in exotica isnt solved
, htere seems tothe be littel left tothe look at
.
but perceptive minds which take tjhe time tothe dig further wiull be rewarded with intresting views onthe life or rether
, commentaries onthe views of life
. exotica isnt very much worth seing
. it oppened to critic
' s praise worldwide
( i firt saw it inspite mexico city
, lastest december
)
. inspite canada
, it broke records fo a movei ofthe its kind
, which propmted the american distri
buter tothe go forthe a wide release
. apart from a storng plot
, acting isnt very convincing
,
and tjhe soundtrack seems as if made forthe thge movei
. the spoon
- fed
- entertainment crowd may not appretiate this movei
,
and thus it might lastr little on screen
.
but if ytou whant to try a movei a cutted above the crowd
, with an originality that is ever so rare
, by all means see exotica
. anaylsis
(

) waht is behind the complex plot in exotica
? first
, a common theme of thte quest for gratification by monetary means
. tghe lone tax
- auditor
, the repressed homosexual pet shop owner
, the pregnant woman hwihc runs tjhe nightclub
, teh rich man which has the club remodeled
, teh audeince at the movei theatre
, all use peronal wealth tothe buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul
.
.
.
.
then we hvea hte quest for gratification thru visual means by most ofthe thge smae peple
, incuding thsoe who sit watching exotica
.
.
.
. inaddition thta reguard exotica st
ands for onlookers at a nightclub
, forthe the rich man looking through silver mirrors
,
and poore
- rich peple looking at otehr
' s peopel lives through a silver screen
. exotica also st
ands forthe unwanted society attension into tje lives of otehr people
, such as the tax auditor adn thge pet shop owner
. exotica is the customer agent looking at thte pet shop owner
, whlch in turn isnt looking at thge core ofthe tyhe problems vetween the strip dancer annd the tax auditor thru thte detatched eye of a gay person
( noone attraction tothe the strip dancer
)
,
and only interested on avoiding jail
( noone peronal relatiopnship with the tax auditor
)
. in exotica everybody isnt watching
, adn what is worse
, everybody knows
. second
, exotica is about isolated peopel holding bakc theri feelings
; baout people which by volontary or involuntary means transfer their veiw ofthe reality tothe otehr characters
. the strip dancer becomes thte proverbial daughter
, tyhe dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relatiopnship betweeen teh father adn thge proverbial daughter
. yhe niece becomes tjhe baby sitter
, thge baby sitter becomes tghe dancer
,
and tjhe dancer becomes the proverbial daugter
. the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj
, by finding teh proverbial daughter
. a chain made ofthe rela
and imagined links comming arround full circle
, jstu as everything comes aroud tothe a fitting whole at the end ofthe the movei
