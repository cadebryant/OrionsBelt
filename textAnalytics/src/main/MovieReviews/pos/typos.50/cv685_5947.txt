forthe the frist reel of girls town
, you just cant ' t git over lili taylor
. is it possible tothe remain unperturbed that a woman of thsi age isnt playing a high skool student
? harder still
, cxan yuo avoid astonishment at how perfect she is inwhich thte part
? with tyhe sure
, showy expertise of a de niro
, taylor imbues unwed mother patti wih all the faux fuck
- ytou confidence she can muster
. it ' s a deeply felt
, dead
- on peformance
,
and by tje halfway point you ' ve forgiven taylor her own maturity
. for all its verite pretenses
, girls twon isnt less about a bunch of high
- schoolers than it is baout a movie director
annd a cadre of writer
- performers examining their own feelings about rape
, relationships
,
and american womanhood
. the movie ' s oppening scenes sketch an easy friendship beetwen a group of four smart
/ sassy high school outsiders on the verge ofthe graduation
: patti
, angela
( bruklin harris
)
, emma
( anna grace
)
,
and nikki
( aunjanue ellis
)
.
but about 10 minutes into the film
, we git owrd that nikki hasnt swallowed a fistful ofthe pills
and bowed outloud ofthe life
. thte remaing girls manaze tothe smug nikki ' s diary outloud of her grieving mother ' s hmeo
,
and page through it at patti ' s place
, investigating the root of nikki ' s dispair
. what they fidn isnt cruel
adn galvanizing
-
- nikki had beeen raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned
,
adn ws privatley questioning the sanaty
and value ofthe a world where such a hting coudl hapen
. shell
- shocked by hte truth ofthe the matter
, the three girls begin tothe talk among themselves
and come tothe a relization about their pwn lives
. emma says she was raped last year on a date with a footall player
. patti ' s barely sympathetic
, wondering whta the hell emma thougth she ws doing whith her shirt off in a jock ' s car
.
and anyway
, patti ' s had her own share ofthe guys who wouldn ' t take noone for an answer
. pained
, acrimonious debte ensues as thte trio grwo more
and omre angry
-
- angry about the impossibility of saying noone
,
and angry with themselves forthe bieng weak
, fo bieng naieve
, forthe puting up withthe it
.
" why do we put up with it
?
" emma fianlly asks
, once the arguent hasnt reached a fever pich
.
" we try to talk about it
,
and look what happens
. we fight for 20 minutes
.
" htere ' s tje admirable crux ofthe htis picture
. girls town is a political film
, infact taht it calls forthe acation
.
but it ' s incomplete
- it ' s never quite sure how to justify that action
, or waht form it shouldnt tkae
. thte trio become crusaders fo thier right to dignity
,
and it ' s surely oney of this year ' s most stirring movei moments whn emma lobs a concrete block through the pasenger
- side window of thgat damn jock ' s car
( doing the right thing
?
)
. they hang out iin tyhe bathroom
, chatting incessantly
adn scrawling slogans
and naming names onthe thte door tothe a toilet stall
.
" subvert tghe patriarchy
,
" emma writes
,
and
thne starts a hall of shame list underneath that otehr students beign tothe contribute to
. the girls silence their hecklers
, take revenge onthe the deadbeat father ofthe patti ' s child
,
and eventualy cmo face
- to
- face iwth nikki ' s tormentor
. still
, the movei has a desparately unfinished quality
,
and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying
.
( you keep waiting forthe someone to call the cops onthe theese brazen girls
,
but nobody thinks ofthe it
.
) perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand
, the film borrows its epigraphs fomr audre lorde
annd queen latifah
(
" who you callin ' a bitch
?
"
)
. tjhe points are well taken
,
bu htey should ahev been unnecessary
. long onthe characterization
bu a littel short onthe stor
, girls twon isnt less tahn it coudl hve been
,
and too self
- congratulatory for my pwn taste
. directer jim mckay is best known as a consort ofthe r
. e
. m
. ' s michael stipe
( he directed thte nearly unwatchable tourfilm fo thgat band
)
,
anbd girls twon is his frist foray inot feature filmmaking
. tghe movei wass created
and scripted by comittee
,
but mckay
and his lead performers had to shoot onthe a shoestring when
, predictably
, tyhe gropu couldn ' t secure funding
.
thn again
, girls twon on a budget owudl hardly be the same film
. the movei ' s slapdash quality isnt key to its signifigance
. truth be told
, all threee of the leads look too wise fo high school
,
but thgat ' s ok
-
- htere ' s a once
- removed quality tothe their fine
, spontaneous performances
, as tje women tkae a vrey skillfull look bakc at tghe girls htey once were
, thte girls they wish they had been
, or some combination
. fo all its flaws
, tihs one gets extra points forthe having its uncertain head
and heart in the same noble place
.
