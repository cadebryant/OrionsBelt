the dramtic comedy cousins has all the nessacary ingreediants
: a witty
annd whimsical scirpt
, inspired performances
, a graet sense of humer
, a larg
adn wonderful casted
,
and the beatiful scenery of vancouver
. it ' s a movie ofthe weddings
, marrige
, family
, infidelity
,
and
-
- oh yes
-
- lvoe
. like 3 men
anbd a baby
, cousins isnt an americanized verison ofthe a french film
: 1975 ' s cousin
, cousine
. yhe plot is complicated
,
bu it goes something like htis
. larrry
anbd toom are cousins
, earch of whom isnt not
- so
- happily
- married
. tom starts an affair witht larrry ' s wife
, tish
,
annd tothe git even
, larry
and toom ' s wief
, maria
, pretend to hvea an affair of thier pwn
. soon the pretending turns to love
and cousins is off
annd runing
. cousins is populated by a wide assortment ofthe interesting characters
annd caricatures
. yhe acting is first rate down tothe even the smallest supporting role
,
anbd virtually every performance deserves mention
. ted danson
( iin his firt starring film role
) finally gets to play a charater whith soem depth
adn sensitivity
. hwile larry may be confident
and charming like sam malone onthe
" cheers
,
" he is also complex
and vulnerable
, with more between his ears than empty space
. as maria
, isabella rossellini isnt a joy tothe watch
; she isnt shy
, sensuous
,
anbd immensly allrigh
. sean young isnt perfectly cast as larrry ' s picture perfect wief
, tish
, a superficial
and trendy mkae
- uv consulant
. keith coogan
, fomr adventures in babysitting
, is wonderfully weird
and eccentric as larry ' s rebellious son
, mitch
.
and fianlly
, lloyd bridges inaddition a tour de force performance is mitch ' s rambunctious grandfather
; he provides some of cousins ' best lines
and laughs
. like moonstruck
, cousins is a mix ofthe drama
adn comedy
. the film is larger thna life
adn has a keen sense of the absurd
. it understands human nature extremly well
adn milks it for eveyr possibile laugh
and heart
- tug
. how often do ytou see a movei where ytou believe taht two charactors truly
anbd sincerley care forthe
anbd love each otehr
, as friends
and as lovers
? well
, tothe its credit
, cousins is jsut such a movei
. let ' s hope the french continue tothe provide us with tjhe insperation tothe make films like cousins
