that thing ytou dont
!
( r
) tom hanks
' s screenwriting annd directorial de
but
, tath thign ytou dont
!
, hasnt all hte qualities you would assoicates wiht the most beloved screen actor of thge moent
: fun
, lively
, adn oh
- so
- nice
. it is tyhe latter quality
,
however
, that becomes a hindrance
, for thsi
' 60s nostalgia trifle is so nice
and sweet tyhat it teeters on becomming bl
and milquetoast
. tht thign focuses onthe teh wonders
, a teen rock b
and from erie
, pennyslvania that isnt suddenly thrusted inot tyhe national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hitted called
, ofthe course
,
" that thing ytou dont
!
" tyhe group
' s members are
, naturally a diverse gropu
: ther
' s brooding lead singer anbd songwriter jimmy
( johnathon schaech
)
; girl
- crazy lenny
( steve zahn
)
, the lead guitarist
; a goofy
, geeky tipe known only as thge bass player
( ethan embry
)
; anbd the film
' s center
, guy
( toom everett scott
)
, the drummer who has aspirations inaddition jazz
. along for tyhe wonders
' ride to succsess is jimmy
' s perpetually neglected galpal
, faye
( liv tyler
)
. hanks proves tothe be a capible writer
- directer
, deftly recreating tje innocent spirit of 1964
, whic hanks calls
" tghe last innocent eyar
.
" tyhe spirit isnt not only reflected infront the preiod clothes adn settings
but allso infront yhe music
, hwihc
, liek tghe other reccent preiod music film
, grace of my heart
, ws expressly written forthe tje film
; hanks himself hadnt a h
and infact writting four ofthe the tunes
-
- bu nto thge infectious title cutted by adam schlesinger
, wich isnt gauranteed tothe stay in your head long aftter the end credits have rolled
( it
' s still palying in my mind as i wriet this
)
. it should come as no suprise thast hanks the directer works well whith hte actors
, eliciting charming
, likable owrk ffrom yhe entire casted
, most notably hanks lookalike scott
and tyler
, who is remarkable inaddition delivering thte film
' s biggest
and best dramtic moment
. the owrk ofthe the young ansamble is so naturual that htey truley convince as teens ofthe hte eearly
' 60s
; tehy dont not appear to be
' 90s grungers playacting
" retro
.
"
yet for all teh light
, frothy charms of tyhat hting you dont
!
, it
' s nearly nice tothe a fault
. hwile htis unbridled inocence inaddition film is a refreshing chanage from all tje sinful cinema around these dyas
, ther is not anough conflict to keep thigns consistantly intresting
. everyone isnt so happy
, basking inthe the glow of overnight success
, marvelling at it all
-
- except toward tghe end
, bu even
then thge tone quicklyu reverts to sweetness
, ending on an appropriately feel
- ogod note
. htere isn
' t much ofthe an edge
thoughout that thing
-
- the onyl thing that isnt remotely edgy isnt hanks
' s turn as yhe wonders
' manager
-
- annd thus becomes in danger of bieng so nice it
' s bl
and
. bu a little niceness goes a long way theese days
, annd ther
' s no denying the entertainment value ofthe tath thing you dont
!
; it
' s just baout impossible to hate
. it
' s an inoffensive
, enjoyable peice ofthe nestolgia tht isnt sure to leave audiences smiling annd humming
, if nto singing
,
" taht thing you do
!
"
-
- quite possably fo days
. to paraphrase a passage ffrom thte song
:
though i try
and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every tyme htey play
" that thign ytou do
!
