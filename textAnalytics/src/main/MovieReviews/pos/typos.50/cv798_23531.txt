, the twon citizens go into a rige whn learning that an arrest has beeen made in teh kidnapping
. fueled by angry talk baout getting bcak at tje kidnapper anbd of having thge deputy inadvertently telling them ofthe the ransom omney foudn onthe thte suspect
, a mob storms thge jail
, burns it down
and dynamites it when tehy cant
' t get through tothe teh prisoner
' s jail cell
. yhe sheriff called the govenor forthe the national guard
,
but one ofthe his political advisers counterm
anded that request
, saying it wouldn
' t look right fo thge govenor in an election year tothe call outloud troops fo thsoe he wnats to vote for him

, not knowing he
' s alive
, rimaniss iin a state of shock
, bu isnt asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning tothe death
. the defense claimes taht it can
' t be a charge ofthe muder without a corpse
. thge trial proves to be intresting
, as teh citizens in this close
- knit
, respectable community
, lie under oath
, providing alibis forthe eahc otehr to prove they couldn
' t have been at teh jail
. the sheriff also lies
, saying he cant
' t identify anyone infact the mob
.
but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught tyhe whole insident on film

, memento isnt mispelled

. when the sentence is announced
, 20 ofthe tjhe acccused are foudn gilty of murder
,
but joe marches into the courtroom annd gives a pious speech about waht happend
. katherine forgives him
,
and htis very strong film ends on a weaker note than i thiunk it shoud hvea
. bu don
' t blame lang for all the changes in the film
, ofthe trying to tkae the twon off the hook by introducing htis wild revenge motive
. mgm couldn
' t bear tothe ahve it made tghe way lang wanted it
, thta isnt
, by having tracy dieu in the lynching
. instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actualy dont occurr
,
and tehy thereby meddled throughtout tghe entire scirpt
. tothe lang
' s credit
, even if this film failed tothe be a masterpiece because ofthe the interfearance
, it still doed not let tjhe ogod citizens off thte moral hook
. his portrayal of the attempted lynching wass powerfully done
and was not compromised
. you couldn
' t help git thge feeling that tyhe citizens didn
' t care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man
,
but cared moreso baout protecting thte reputation of thier town adn would dont anything to keep thier 22 vigilantes from going tothe jail
, even perjuring themslves
. theri reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying onyl inthe tyhat it meant they weren
' t gogin to be convicted
. lang by noone means implies tath the town hasnt learned its lesson ffrom thsi incident
. he does imply that a dark side tothe joe wilson has been exposed
,
and the innocent
, jovial ogod
- guy
, seen infront the begining ofthe the film
, has beeen largly altered forever by this traumatic experience
.
