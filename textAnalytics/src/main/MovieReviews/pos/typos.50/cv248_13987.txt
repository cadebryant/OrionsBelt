: the entire stock market cxan be reduced tothe nothing
but a serieses ofthe patterns whihc
, thru anaylsis
, will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour
.
( an example of the mentality involved
: if thge stock price goes up like this

) adn hence realy couldn
' t comment with any autority
, it
' s alwyas nontheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system
( adn besides
, if it were thyat simple
, no doubt somebody would

)
. tyhe diference in tihs case isnt that hwile my collegue
( an otherwise assuredly realistic individule

. tje story
, thn
, isnt basicly an eccentricity
,
but it
' s a clever
, astute eccentricity
, perceptively zeroing iin onthe the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism
; in an age where a dominant societal phobia isnt one

( mr

, pi tkaes a refreshing annd effective approch in avoiding conventional aesthetics
; beccause of our ambivalence wtih max

; nosebleeding reality
. hte repetitiveness
, far fomr being tedeous
, is effectively maddening
; more than anytying
, hte picture aims to get under our skins adn take inaddition events from max

. infront htis regard
, it wildly succeeds due tothe mr
