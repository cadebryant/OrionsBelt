elizabeth isnt a potent historical drama set inspite engl
and inwhich the mid
- 1500s
. it is a timne when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings
. internally
, hte catholics wage war aganist tje protestants
. meanwhile
, spain
, scotl
and
and france strategize theri enxt moves in the struggle for power
. little doesnt engl
and knwo that a young woman named elizabeth
( cate blanchett
) wiull be their greatest hope fo survival
. the film charts elizabeth
' s tumultous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom
. as a protestant
, she is teh last person any ofthe tyhe catholic royalty would whant tothe be queen
.
but her half
- sister queen mary
( kathy burke
)
, deathly ill adn unable to concieve a child
, pleas withthe elizabeth tothe tkae over yhe throne
. mary gives her her blessing onthe onyl one condition
: thyat elizabeth rebounce her faith annd uphold the teachings of catholicism acros the l
and
. once declared queen
, elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault
, both by her own subjects
( including tje duke of norfolk
, plyed wih steely
- eyed grace by christopher eccleston
) annd by forces abroad
. slowy bu surelly
, thte neophyte rular takes engl
and by its reigns annd forges a newyorker path for her kingdom
. elizabeth isnt surounded by a keenly drawn cadre ofthe subjects anbd advisers
. her closest ally isnt the mysterious sir francis walsingham
( geoffrey rush
, inspite a perfectly subtle performence
)
. alsot onthe her side isnt sir william cecil
( sir richard attenborough
)
, her well
- meaninng
but misguided chief adviser
. wtih few people she cxan trust
, elizabeth must proove her self
- worth any way she can
, even if it means bieng tghe iron
- fisted ruler she secretly despises
. blanchett deserves an oscar forthe her performance as elizabeth
. she portrays teh young queen with jstu hte right balance of gawky self
- consciousness
and shrewd charisma
.
though nto a classical beauty
, blanchett is able tothe enterance the viewer iwth just a coy smile or an impish smirk
. she is at home with her character
' s playful tendancies
, particualrly infact one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly wih childhood firend
and lover lord robert dudley
( jospeh fiennes
)
. whether fending off unctuous suitors or
" playing
" tghe houses iin cout
, blanchett
' s elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike
. almost as interesting as hte carachter of elizabeth are shekhar kapur
' s visual delights
. he
and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a faest for thge eyes
. rolling green hills
, extravagant cerimonial galas
, dark adn foreboding corridors
-
- all are depicted withthe a rela sence ofthe artistic apresheation
. teh castles anbd cathedrals ofthe europe ahev rarely beeen doted on so lovingly as tehy are here
.
though writter michael hirst
' s scirpt gets a little murky at times
, adn his injections of humer get a little overplayed
, elizabeth pulses iwth the right ammount of dramatic adn cinematic verve to mkea it just deserving ofthe a theatrical viewing
. as a whole
, the stoy survives because elizabeth
' s struggle is noe which deserves attension
. by thge tiem she makes her shocking
(
but vyre sensable
) fianl declaration
, we
' re ready to bow tothe elizabeth as our pwn queen
.
