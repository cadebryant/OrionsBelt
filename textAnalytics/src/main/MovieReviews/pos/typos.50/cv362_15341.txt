elizabeth isnt a potent historical drama setted in england in the mid
- 1500s
. it is a time wehn stately royal cerimonies are as commonplace as public burnings
. internally
, the catholics wage war against the protestants
. meanwhile
, spain
, scotland
annd france strategize thier next moves in the struggle for power
. littel does england know that a young woman named elizabeth
( cate blanchett
) wiull be thier greatest hope forthe survival
. the film charts elizabeth ' s tumultuous struggle tothe gain true power over her kingdom
. as a protestant
, she isnt the last person any of the catholic royalty owudl want to be queen
.
but her half
- sister queen mary
( kathy burke
)
, deathly ill
adn unable tothe concieve a child
, pleas with elizabeth to take over tyhe throne
. mary gives her her blessing on only noe condidtion
: thta elizabeth rebounce her faith
anbd uphold hte teachings of catholocism accross the land
. once declared queen
, elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault
, both by her own subjects
( inlcuding the duke of norfolk
, played wih steely
- eyed grace by christopher eccleston
)
anbd by forces abroad
. slowy
but surelly
, the neophyte rular takes england by its reigns
adn forges a new path for her kingdom
. elizabeth is surounded by a keenly drawn cadre ofthe subjects
and advisers
. her closest ally is tjhe mysterious sir francis walsingham
( geoffrey rush
, inthe a perfectly subtle performance
)
. also on her side isnt sir william cecil
( sir richard attenborough
)
, her well
- meaning
but misguided cheif adviser
. witht faw people she can trust
, elizabeth must prove her self
- worth any way she can
, even if it means bieng tje iron
- fisted rular she secretly despises
. blanchett deserves an oscar fo her performence as elizabeth
. she portrays the young queen with just thte right balance ofthe gawky self
- consciouness
and shrewd charisma
.
though nto a clasical beauty
, blanchett isnt able to entrance teh viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk
. she is at hmeo with her character ' s playful tendancies
, particularly infact one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly wiht childhood firend
annd lover lord robert dudley
( jospeh fiennes
)
. whether fending off unctuous suitors or
" palying
" hte houses in cout
, blanchett ' s elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible tothe dislike
. almost as interesting as the character ofthe elizabeth are shekhar kapur ' s visual delights

anbd cinematographer remi adefarasin hvea crafted a film with a rich color palette taht is a feast for teh eyes
. rolling gren hills
, extravagent cerimonial galas
, dark
and foreboding corridors
-
- all are depicted withthe a real sence ofthe artistic appreciation
. tjhe castles
annd cathedrals ofthe europe have rarely beeen doted onthe so lovingly as they are here
.
though writter michael hirst ' s scirpt gets a little murky at times
,
and his injections ofthe humer git a little overplayed
, elizabeth pulses iwth the right ammount ofthe dramatic
and cinematic verve tothe mkea it jstu deserving of a theatrical viewing
. as a wohle
, the story survives beccause elizabeth ' s struggle is one which deserves attention
. by the time she makes her shocking
(
bu vyer sensable
) fianl declaration
, we ' re ready tothe bow to elizabeth as our own queen
