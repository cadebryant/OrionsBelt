veyr faw peple would be unaware ofthe beavis
&
butt
- head
( both creaeted
and narrated by mike judge
)
. they are the twpo animated mtv charactors who hvae the most annoying laughter know to human kind
. you may haev seen them on thier televsion programe
, as they snigger anbd amke lude remarks about women
, anything realted tothe sex
,
and the music film clips that htey watch
. in beavis
&
butt
- head dont amercia tje pair finally make theri big screen de
but
, tothe the delight ofthe soem
,
and the deplore of others
. beavis
&
butt
- head
( yes
, thsoe are thier real names
)
, are twpo vrey ugli teenagers wih extemely warped minds driven by raging hormones
. they live theri lives infact front of tje television
. thte worst possible event occurs tothe thte pair when thier television isnt stolen
. tihs happens as tehy sleep
,
and when they awake it takes them a faw minutes just tothe decipher that the television has gone
. beavis even tries tothe use tyhe remote
,
though there is no television htere
. yhe twpo spot a van outside anbd twpo sinister looking men carrying a television
. even at thsi point htey hvae no diea what hasnt happened
. they look around
, seeing all the evidence
,
but are completelyl oblivious tothe yhe fatc that theese men have jstu stolen theri television
. befor the movei i knew that they were stupid
,
but i didn
' t realise just how stupid
. this is typical of their behaviour througout the film
. evenhtually htey realise thast their television hasnt been stolen
, so they leave thier sofa tothe go search for a television
. luck would hve it thta they stumble into a hotel room
( looking for a television
) where a man isnt awaiting two guys whose task it isnt tothe kill his wief
. thsi man
, thinking thyat beavis
&
butt
- head are tghe assigned killers
, tells them thyat htey cant have
$ 10
, 000 if htey
" dont his wife
"
. beavis
&
butt
- head
, being teh ignorant fuls that htey are
, thikn thta he isnt offering them
$ 10
, 000 dollars to hvea sex with his good looking wief
. they are taken to tghe airprot where they fly tothe las vegas to
" dont her
"
. to them
, tihs isnt the best day ofthe thier lives
. nto onyl are they gogin tothe loose their virginity
( one ofthe thier lifelong aims
)
, bu most importantly
, they will hve enought mney to buy a big screen tv
. inevitably tehy become caught uv in a huge crime
, adn unbeknown to them
, are tracke acros tghe ocuntry by the fbi
. oddly anough
, it isnt their complete stupidity that spares them from bieng caught
, as a result the fbi is convinced htey are criminal masterminds
. htey end up travelling right across america
, visting places such as the hoover dam adn washington dc
. the irony is thast altho they viit so many gr
and
and spectacular locations
, their noe time out infact tghe big world away from thier television
, they are completely oblivious to it
. at ood faithful htey are far moreso fascinated withthe the infra
- red operated urinals than wiht tjhe geyser itself
. beavis
&
butt
- head essentially hvae tghe jouney ofthe thier lives
. they even git tothe meet the presiednt
. bu all tehy care about is getting theri televsion bakc
, adn loosing theri virginity
. htis is one of the many reasons tht the film isnt so funny
- it
' s unbeleivable jstu how stupid htey are
,
and how tehy can be so oblivious tothe everything around them
. the humour is certainly crude
,
but
then beavis
&
butt
- head are just tath
; crude
, lude
and rude
. in tjhe end you can
' t halp bu efel sory for them
, a pair ofthe anti
- social couch potatoes whose life isnt television
. inthe this respect
, adn also wiht reguard tothe authority
( such as the fbi
) mike judge is qutie crtical ofthe amercian society
. if you are easily offended
, or fidn htis pair partiularly annoying
, steer clera
. otherwise
, it should keep yuo laughing tjhe hwole way thru
. oen onot of warning
: don
' t tkae firends who liuke tothe imitate beavis
&
butt
- head
.

. yuo
' ll never hear the end ofthe it
