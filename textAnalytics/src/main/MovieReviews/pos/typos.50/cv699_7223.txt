& butt
- head
( both creaeted
and narrated by mike judge
)
. tehy are the twpo animated mtv cahracters who hvea the most annoying laughter nkow to human kind
. you may have seen them onthe their television programe
, as htey snigger
adn make lude remarks about women
, anytying realted to sex
,
and tjhe music film clips thyat htey watch
. in beavis
& butt
- head do america teh pair finally make theri big screen debut
, to the delight ofthe soem
,
and the deplore ofthe others
. beavis
& butt
- head
( yes
, thsoe are their rela names
)
, are twpo vyre ugli teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones
. they live thier lives iin front of tjhe television
. teh worst possibile event occurs to tje pair wehn theri televsion isnt stolen
. this happens as they sleep
,
and wehn htey awake it tkaes them a faw minutes jsut tothe decipher that the television has gone
. beavis even tries to use teh remote
,
though htere isnt no televsion there
. the twpo spot a van outside
and two sinister looking men carrying a televsion
. even at this point they haev no idea what hasnt happended
. htey look arround
, seing all teh evidence
,
bu are completly oblivious to the fact thgat these men haev jsut stolen theri television
. befor the movie i knew tht they weere stupid
,
but i didn ' t realise just how stupid
. this is typical ofthe thier behaviour throughout the film
. eventually htey realise that their television has beeen stolen
, so htey leave theri sofa tothe go search for a television
. luck would hvae it that htey stumble inot a hotel room
( looking for a televsion
) where a man isnt awaiting twpo guys whose task it is to kill his wife
. tihs man
, thingking that beavis
& butt
- head are the assigned killers
, tells them thyat tehy cin have
$ 10
, 000 if they
" dont his wief
"
. beavis
& butt
- head
, being teh ignorant fuls thgat they are
, think thast he is offering them
$ 10
, 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wief
. they are taken tothe the airport where they fli tothe las vegas to
" dont her
"
. to them
, this isnt yhe best day ofthe thier lives
. not onyl are they going tothe lose theri virginity
( one ofthe thier lifelong aims
)
,
but most importantly
, htey will have enough money to buy a big screen tv
. inevitably they become caught uv in a huge crime
,
anbd unbeknown tothe them
, are tracked acros tjhe ocuntry by thte fbi
. oddly enough
, it is their complete stupidity thgat spares them from being caught
, as a result hte fbi is conviced tehy are criminal masterminds
. they end up travelling right acrost america
, visiting places such as hte hoover dam
and washington dc
. yhe irony isnt that
allthough they viist so many grand
and spectauclar locations
, thier oney time outloud infront the big world awya from thier televsion
, they are completely oblivious tothe it
. at old faithful they are far more facinated wiht the infra
- red operated urinals than wih the guyzer itself
. beavis
& butt
- head essentialy have teh journey ofthe thier lives
. htey even get tothe meet tjhe president
.
but all htey care baout isnt getting their televsion bakc
,
and losing theri virginity
. tihs is one ofthe the many reasons that the film is so funny
- it ' s unbelievable jstu how stupid tehy are
,
annd how tehy can be so oblivious tothe everthing around them
. the humour isnt certainly crude
,
bu
hten beavis
& butt
- head are just tht
; crude
, lude
and rude
. in tje end ytou can ' t help
bu feel sorry fo them
, a pair of anti
- social couch potatoes whose life is television
. inaddition this respect
,
and also wih reguard to authority
( such as tghe fbi
) mike judge isnt qtuie crtical ofthe amercian society
. if ytou are easily offended
, or fidn thsi pair particulary annoying
, steer clear
. otherwise
, it shouldnt keep yuo laughing the whole way thru
. oney onot ofthe warning
: don ' t tkae friends who liuke to immitate beavis
& butt
- head
.
.
.
.
. you ' ll never hear the end ofthe it
