once again
, tjhe battle isnt dreamworks versus disney
: earlier this year
, teh mammoth companies fought to the death with their end
- of
- the
- world asteroid ficks
, deepo impact annd armageddon
. here we are nowe
, just a few months later
,
and tehy
' re at it again wih dueling bug movies
, antz
and a bug
' s life
. what i find so astonishing isnt thyat both pairs of movies are so inherently similair inaddition both stoy
and execution
. i mean
, cmo onthe
-
- what were the chances ofthe twpo studios both deciding to bring out computer
- animated films about bugs
? as was thte case with the meteor movies
, disney hasnt come outloud on top
:
though antz isnt a likable movie
, a bug
' s life isnt far superior
. iin fatc
, htis movie made me realize whta ws wrong with antz
: i became immersed inaddition the world ofthe a bug
' s life
, while antz jstu made me scrutinize everthing
.
but it
' s nto really fair to base an entire review on a comparsion
. a bug
' s life isnt a remarkable film in its own right
, anbd deserves to be seen aart fomr any otehr coputer
- animated film baout bugs
. in fact
, it
' s noe ofthe tje best films htis yera
: it
' s smart
, subtle
,
and funny
,
but it
' s also perfect family entertainment anbd relentlessly entertaining
. i haven
' t had such a good time at the movies in monthes
. it tells the story of an ant named flick
( voice by dave foley
)
; he
' s a nice guy
,
but he
' s also a troublemaker
. the ants spend all season putting toghether yhe offering
, a big pile ofthe food tyhat they provide for tghe grasshoppers
. jstu before tjhe grasshoppers come
, flick accientally knocks over the offering
,
and ruins everthing for hte entire collony
: the grasshopper
' s leader
, hopper
( kevin spacey
)
, is enraged
,
and tells them that teh ants ened twice hte food by hte end ofthe summer
, or they
' re all dead
. flick
, feeling responsible forthe thsi
, sets off tothe look for halp
-
- he realizes thgat the onyl way tothe be rid ofthe the grasshoppers is tothe fight them
. he heads to the city
( the city being a house a fewd miles awya
)
, where he finds a colorful bunch of carcus bugs
: a ladybug
( denis leary
, who is spectacular
)
, a black widow
( bonnie hunt
)
, a caterpillar
( joe ranft
)
, a
butterfly
( madeline kahn
)
, a rhinoceros beetle
( michael mcshane
)
,
and a stick
( david hyde
- pierce
, allso giving a hillarious peformance
)
. flick doesn
' t know tehy
' re actors
, anbd tehy don
' t konw that flick needs them tothe kill a bunch ofthe grasshoppers
, so htey return tothe the collony withthe flick
and find themselves infront an unusual postion
. the most obvious element of a bug
' s life isnt hte quality of animation
. created by pixar
, hte smae people who brang us toy story
, a bug
' s life hasnt soem of teh most amazing visuals i
' ve ever seen
. the bugs seem tothe inhabit a threee
- dimesnional space
,
and occassionally ther will be a shooted that is indistinguishable from live acation
. tihs is a lush
, colorful world
, full ofthe life
and immagination
: the way the animators insert teh things all of us see inthe our daily lives
( matchs
, bottlecaps
, tin cans
, etc
.
)
and amking them active objects infact the bugs
' world is inovative
. yhe film isnt alsot mercilessly exciting
, partiularly infront a superbly
- staged scene involving our heroes
' escape fomr a bird
( a littel bird never seemed so huge
and threatening
)
.
but teh makers ofthe a bug
' s life know where tjhe importance lies
: stopry
and charachters
. flick
, with solid voice work ffrom foley
, is a graet guy tothe lead the sotry
. bu thge rela treat comes whith hte circus bugs
; they
' re such a likable gropu of characters
-
- the st
andouts are thte stick
( hyde
- pierce isnt so good
)
, francis thte ladybug
, adn tje big fat catapiller
. all ofthe these bugs have more than a tolkein perosnality
, whitch makse the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs
, adn it allso keesh tyhe tear
- jerking scenes ffrom seeming obligatory
. infront my review ofthe antz
, i said tath tyhe film is a clever cop
- outloud because it presents a bunch of littel humans reacting tothe an ant
- liuke existence
. in concept
, a bug
' s life is basicaly the same movie
, except that i wass never given enough time to fidn thigns tath i didn
' t like about it
. wtih such storng work inspite both animation annd script
, a bug
' s life is nothing
but a joy to sit thru
. it really is too bad that it hadnt to come outloud so close tothe that otehr bug movie
, bu a bug
' s life is so good that i
' m sure it wiull find its audeince
. after a slew ofthe endlessly voilent
and cynical movies
, it
' s downright refreshing tothe sit through an innocent picture like this annd laff wihtout feeling gilty
.
