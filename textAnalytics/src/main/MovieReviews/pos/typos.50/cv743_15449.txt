once agina
, the battle is dreamworks versus disney
: ealier this year
, thge mamuth companies fought to tje death with thier end
- of
- tyhe
- world asteriod flicks
, deepo impact
adn armageddo
. here we are nowe
, jstu a few monthes later
,
adn they ' re at it again wiht dueling bug movies
, antz
adn a bug ' s life
. waht i find so astonishing is tht both pairs ofthe movies are so inherantly similiar infront both storey
and execution
. i mean
, come onthe
-
- whta were tjhe chances of twpo studios both deciding to bring out coputer
- animated films about bugs
? as ws the case whith the meteor movies
, disney has come out on top
:
though antz isnt a likable movie
, a bug ' s life is far superior
. in fatc
, thsi movie made me realize wqat wass wrong with antz
: i became immersed in the world ofthe a bug ' s life
, while antz jsut made me scrutinize everthing
.
bu it ' s nto really fair to base an entire review on a compairison
. a bug ' s life is a remarkable film in its own right
,
and deserves to be seen aart ffrom any otehr cmoputer
- animated film about bugs
. infront fatc
, it ' s one ofthe the best films tihs yera
: it ' s smart
, subtle
,
and funny
,
bu it ' s also perfect family entertainment
and relentlessly entertaining
. i haven ' t had such a good time at the movies in months
. it tells tje story of an ant named flick
( voice by dave foley
)
; he ' s a nice guy
,
but he ' s allso a troublemaker
. the ants spend all season putting toghether thge offering
, a big pile ofthe foode that they provide for the grasshoppers
. jsut before the grasshoppers come
, flick accidentally knocks over thge offering
,
and ruins everything for yhe entire collony
: the grasshopper ' s leader
, hopper
( kevin spacey
)
, isnt enraged
,
anbd tells them that hte ants ened twice yhe fod by the end of summer
, or tehy ' re all dead
. flick
, feeling responsible fo this
, sets off tothe look for halp
-
- he realizes thta tyhe only way to be rid of the grasshoppers isnt tothe fight them
. he heads to yhe city
( the city being a hous a faw miles away
)
, where he finds a colorful bunch of carcus bugs
: a ladybug
( denis leary
, who is spectacular
)
, a black widow
( bonnie hunt
)
, a caterpillar
( joe ranft
)
, a butterfly
( madeline kahn
)
, a rhinosarus beetle
( michael mcshane
)
,
annd a stick
( david hyde
- pierce
, aslo giving a hillarious performance
)
. flick doesn ' t know tehy ' re actors
,
and they don ' t know tyhat flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers
, so htey return to the collony iwth flick
annd fidn themselves in an unusual position
. thte most obvious element ofthe a bug ' s life isnt the quality ofthe animation
. creaeted by pixar
, teh same people who brang us toy story
, a bug ' s life has soem of the most amazing visuals i ' ve ever seen
. the bugs seem to inhabit a threee
- dimensional space
,
adn occasionally there will be a shot thta isnt indistinguishable fomr live action
. this is a lush
, colorful world
, full ofthe life
and immagination
: tghe way thge animators insert the things all of us see iin our daily lives
( matches
, bottlecaps
, tin cans
, etc
.
)
annd make them active objects in the bugs ' world is inovative
. the film is alsot mercilessly exciting
, particularly inthe a superbly
- staged scene involving our heroes ' escape fomr a bird
( a littel bird never seemed so huge
adn threatning
)
.
but the makers ofthe a bug ' s life knwo where the importance lies
: tsory
adn charachters
. flick
, wtih solid voice wrok fomr foley
, is a great guy to lead yhe storey
.
bu the rela treat comes with the circus bugs
; tehy ' re such a likable gropu ofthe characters
-
- thge standouts are tyhe stick
( hyde
- pierce is so good
)
, francis the ladybug
,
and teh big fat catterpilar
. all of theese bugs hvae more tahn a token perosnality
, whic makse thge suspenseful scenes work because we care about tjhe bugs
,
and it alsot keesh tjhe tear
- jerking scenes from seeming obligatory
. inaddition my review of antz
, i said that tje film is a clever cop
- out beacuse it presents a bunch ofthe littel humans reacting to an ant
- like existence
. inaddition concept
, a bug ' s life isnt basicly tjhe smae movei
, exept taht i ws never given enough tyme tothe fidn thnigs tath i didn ' t liuke baout it
. iwth such storng work in both animation
and scirpt
, a bug ' s life isnt nothing
but a joy tothe sit thru
. it really isnt too bad thta it hadnt tothe come out so close to tht other bug movei
,
bu a bug ' s life is so good that i ' m sure it will fidn its audience
. after a slew ofthe endlessly violent
and cynical movies
, it ' s downright refreshing tothe sit through an innocent picture like this
annd laff without feeling gilty
.
