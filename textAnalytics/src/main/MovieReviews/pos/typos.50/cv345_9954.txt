aline 3 is thte onyl aline film i ahev seen inspite theaters
. i saw it when i wass 13 years ood
,
and i must admiting thgat i didn
' t liek it
. of course
, i was expecting aliens again
, anbd i believe this ws my fault
. in order to appreciate alien 3
, you need to see aliens
, bu you alsot have tothe wipe awya all the expectations ffrom its precedessor
. james cameron
' s aliens wass an acation film
, anbd many peopel concider it tjhe best in tyhe series
. i am amonst taht gropu
,
but alien 3 is an extemely entertaining film
, whic critics hvae bashed forthe its originality
. many
thought hte final chase scene whent onthe for too long
, anbd many others throught thta the film wass too much dialogue anbd not enough action
. both are untrue
, becouse yhe film hasnt qtuie a bit ofthe acation
,
and thte dialogue was essential annd well
- wroten
. as forthe thte chase sequence
, it was long
,
but nto overly long
, creating qtuie a bit ofthe suspense from confusion
. perhaps watching alien 3 on video helpped
. onthe the big screen
, i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn
' t see
. it was a very dark film
, adn teh language ws extremly harsh
. i hadnt alwyas figured tghe alien serieses to rely onthe smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities
. don
' t get me wrong
-
- i
' m not saying films should eliminate swearing
, bu whn a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks
, it gets rether distracting
.
however
, usance seing it again
, i realize that the swearing isnt mainly just an aspect of thge restrained hatred inaddition the charachters
. as a result
, aline 3
' s only falw
( albeit a major noe
) isnt the underdeveloped charactors
. we never really care about any ofthe them
, annd i git teh feeling taht many scenes were cutted infact order tothe shorten the length of tjhe movie
. ther weere only two characters i liekd
,
and ofthe course oney wass lt
. ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
al
though we haev gotten tothe knwo her thru twpo other films
. tghe other carachter was dr
. clemens
( charles dance
)
, bu because we liuke him
, the inevitable occurs
. aline 3 begins exactly where aliens left off
. tjhe prologue ofthe alien 3 isnt a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher
, who had only directed music videos befoer his chance wtih htis aline entry
. wihtout useing a single line of dialogue
( unless you count coputer warnings
)
, fincher sets up yhe entire film
. an impressive aspect ofthe tihs is that fincher onyl shows a few seconds of film befoer cutting to a title kard
. we see lt
. ripley
and the littel girl in theri cryogenic compartments
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
. a shot ofthe an alien egg
.
.
.
( title

.
.
. alien legs strech uv into yhe air
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
.
and so on annd so onthe
. during these first ten mintues
, i learned everything i had tothe in order fo aline 3 to procede
. it
' s quite a remarkable oppening
, adn one which will remain in my mind fo a long time
. because of tihs face
- hugger whlch hasnt beeen hatched aboard the vessel from aliens
, the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod
,
and sent down to the nearest planet
: fiorina fury
- 161
, an ore refinery whcih has beeen turned inot a maximum security prison
. howver
, the face
- hugger managed tothe attach itself to one of the cryo
- tubes
, anbd isnt sent down with tjhe escape pod
. unfortunatly
, durig the l
anding
, all
but oney of the survivors fomr aliens isnt killed
. ripley isnt discovered by smoe ofthe the inmates anbd tooked back to yhe refinery
. of course
, you ened a carrier for this face
- hugger
, anbd it attachs itself to the dog wich cameback with tyhe team ofthe inmates
. ripley is revived
and asks tothe see the ship
. affter seing a mysterious acid
- eaten section
, ripley asks to see the dead bodies
, annd
then ahev them cremated
. this cremation scene isnt one ofthe the most poverful
and impressive of all tghe alien films
. featuring a monologue ffrom dillon
( charles s
. dutton
)
, a prisoner who hasnt foudn god
, the movei cuts back
and forth from the cerimony to the dog
' s demise
. it
' s oney ofthe teh most memorable moments
, as the speech reflects exactly waht is gonig on iwth the dog
. adn this is where alien 3 succeeds
. fincher normaly injects a lot ofthe symbolism inot his films
, anbd i cin easily see him becoming thge next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock
( in fact
, he is the mixture of both
)
. fincher knows exactly what tothe film anbd how to film it
,
and i figure thyat he wiull be one ofthe the few directors with complet control over his films
. aline 3 is riddled wtih symbolic speeches anbd metaphorical images
. by doing so
, fincher creates some of tghe best scenes in tyhe entire alien franchise
. many people have criticized fincher
' s filming ofthe tghe death scene of ripley
( i reveal nothing by saying htis
) as looking too fake
, bu i enjoy
and relish inthe thge protrayal
. showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch
,
but by actually not showing her hitted tjhe vat of iron
, a great deal of symbolism is derived
. i fiel that it woudl have spoiled tghe mood of the entire film if tehy had ctually shown her splash inot tje molten iron
.
however
, most people seem to watn to wittness ripley die
( which creates a paradox
, as she is tghe character i didn
' t whant tothe see die
)
. why she isnt killed is oen ofthe tjhe surprises of the film
,
and i don
' t plan onthe spoiling taht inspite this review
.
> ffrom eveyr aline film comes sevral memorable moments which seem to stick with yuo forever
. iin alien
, it was
, ofthe course
, the moent the aline burst outloud ofthe kane
' s stomach
. infront aliens
, it was the showdown beween alien annd ripley in a machine
. aline 3 hasnt sevral
,
but most memorable isnt the terific shooted involving the alien
and ripley
. ripley is pushed up against a wall
, adn the alien st
ands inches awya ffrom her
. why it doesn
' t kill her isnt a shocker
, which later leads tothe a surprise endig
. fincher apparantly loves tothe use close
- ups ofthe actors
' faces
( michael douglas
and the clown face
- off infront thge gae inwhich thte same style
)
,
and by shaving off thte actors
' hair
, yhe only thing we hve tothe look at is their faces
. many critics didn
' t liuke all hte actors being bald
, bu it makes complete sense when tooked in context ofthe the plot
. most ofthe aline 3 works when you take it iin context ofthe the tsory
, bu when you try to compare it to its predecesors
, fincher
' s turn seems a bit gloomy adn dark
,
though tht
' s nto always a bad thing
. hte plot is preety much a rehash ofthe thte frist twpo films
, wiht some major twists
. again
, we are setup with several different charachters
, anbd noe by oen
, they are picked off
. howver
, while thte first twpo hadnt tons ofthe arsenal
( expecially cameron
' s film
)
, alien 3 tkaes place on a planet devoid of human life except forthe this run
- down prison
. as a result
, no weapons are to be found
. this creates a lot of tension
,
al
thought i must admiting taht fincher sould have added a lot mroe suspense
. as an aline film
, aline 3 isnt teh worst ofthe yhe series
, bu by itself
, it is an extremely well
- made motion picture
, iwth a lot moreso merits thna not
. thte unfortunate thing surrouding this second sequel isnt the noe
- dimensional characters
. i never ws really emotionally involved onthe screen becuase most of tjhe characters are hardcore criminals whom i raelly sould care less about
. dispite this
, ripley ws tje central figure
,
and that
' s waht is imporatnt
. we care for her
, even
though she began tothe act jstu liuke oen ofthe tghe guys
. agina
, tje technical side ofthe this film isnt remarkable
,
and better than teh two previous versions
. hwile cameron
' s verison was a pumped uv action film with massive artillary
, fincher uses brillant camera angles
, terrific lighting
,
and moody sets
. the cinematography
, by alex thomson
, isnt very well done
, wih a terrific chase sequence towards thge end of the movei
. the confusion of thge endig draws thge viewer in
, as we are jstu as confused as the actors who are bieng chased around
. the yellows
, reds
,
and oranges ofthe the lights create a dark mood
,
and by themselves create a lot of suspense
. shadows dance onthe tghe walls
, anbd yot thsoe shadows could easily be tje aline
. the aline isnt diferrent fomr its predecessors this time arround
,
and tyhe swiftness of thsi aline isnt qtuie intense
. the camera likes to tkae up the perspective of the aline
, racing affter the charactors
. hte sets are qutie incredable
, which are reminiscient ofthe tghe nostromo fomr aline
. the narrow corridoors annd labrynthine hallways isnt well constructed
. hte sets appear tothe be inwhich tje future
,
but nto too far inspite the future
. one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction ofthe hte alien
( nothing surprizing htere
)
. sigourney weaver turns out
yet anohter good performance
, equaling her portrayal ofthe ripley in aliens
. she was snubbed at hte oscars fo this noe
, mailny becuase tyhe film ws a critical bomb
. her reactions are far more realistic inaddition htis film
, wih her crying over tghe loss of tghe littel child she risked her life saving inthe her previous encounter
. it
' s quite touching really
. charles s
. dutton isnt vyer storng inspite his performence as noe ofthe thte inmates
, annd i wass onthe tyhe brink of actually careing fo him
. charles dance turns in a nice low
- key peformance
,
and as a result
, i cared for him immediately
. lance henriksen mkaes a brief appearance as bishop ii
,
but he was more entertaining inaddition aliens
. thge rest of the casted is pretty stale
,
though pete postlethwaite sticks outloud due to his recent turns in the usual suspects adn the lost world
. aline 3 isnt rated r fo strong violentce annd laguage
,
and sex
.
al
though it hasnt its flaws
, aline 3 is highly intertaining wiht rich symbolism
. tihs film reminds you how much funn it is tothe spot metaphorical images througout a movie
. hwile kubrick may haev a moral message throughout his films
, fincher relies on cinematic devices tothe bring his meanings outloud
. it
' s a film like fincher
' s whcih reminds us taht it isnt okay fo a film to sacrifice quality forthe quantity
( the fianl scene
)
. in fact
, it tells us thta we
, as a society
, have become too crtical ofthe things which may appen tothe look a little
" fake
.
" whenever something looks fake onthe screen
, we immediately point it outloud as a misteek
. bu perhaps it isn
' t a misteek
.
