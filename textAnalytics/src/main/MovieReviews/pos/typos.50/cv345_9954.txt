alien 3 isnt the onyl aline film i haev seen inwhich theaters
. i saw it when i wass 13 years ood
,
and i must admited that i didn ' t like it
. ofthe course
, i wass expecting aliens agina
,
and i believe this was my fault
. inspite order tothe appretiate aline 3
, ytou need to see aliens
,
bu you also have tothe wipe awya all the expectations ffrom its precedessor
. james cameron ' s aliens wass an action film
,
and many peopel consider it the best infact thte series
. i am among tyhat group
,
but alien 3 is an extremely intertaining film
, whihc criticists hvae bashed for its originality
. many thought the final chase scene whent onthe for too long
,
adn many others thougth thgat tghe film was too much dialogue
and nto enough action
. both are untrue
, because the film has qutie a bited of action
,
and the dialogue wass essential
annd well
- written
. as fo thte chase sequence
, it wass long
,
but nto overly long
, creating quite a bit ofthe suspense ffrom confusion
. perhaps watching aline 3 onthe video helped
. on yhe big screen
, i was overwhelmed by something i normaly didn ' t see
. it was a very dark film
,
adn the language ws extrememly harsh
. i hadnt alwasy figured yhe aline series to rely on smart dialogue instade of moronic profanities
. don ' t get me wrong
-
- i ' m not saying films shoudl eliminate swearing
,
bu whn a film substitutes dialogue with theese profane remarks
, it gets rather distracting
.
however
, sicne seeing it agina
, i realize thta the swearing isnt mailny just an aspect of the restrained hatred infront thte characters
. as a result
, aline 3 ' s only flaw
( albeit a major noe
) isnt yhe underdeveloped cahracters
. we never raelly care about any ofthe them
,
adn i get the feeling thast many scenes were cut in order to shorten tyhe lenght ofthe thte movie
. ther were onyl twpo charachters i liked
,
adn of course oney ws lt
. ripley
( sigourney weaver
)
,
although we have gotten tothe know her thru twpo otehr films
. thge otehr charcter was dr
. clemens
( charles dance
)
,
but beccause we like him
, the inevitable occurs
. alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off
. the prologue ofthe alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievment by director david fincher
, who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry
. wihtout using a single line ofthe dialogue
( unless yuo count computer warnings
)
, fincher sets up the entire film
. an impressive aspect ofthe this isnt thast fincher onyl shows a few seconds of film befoer cutting tothe a title kard
. we see lt
. ripley
adn teh little girl in their cryogenic compartments
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
. a shooted of an alien egg
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
. alien legs stretch uv inot the air
.
.
.
( title
)
.
.
.
adn so on
and so onthe
. durring theese firt ten minutes
, i learned everything i hadnt to in order for alien 3 tothe procede
. it ' s quite a remarkable oppening
,
annd one wich iwll remian in my mind forthe a long timne
. becuase of htis face
- hugger which has been hatched aboard hte vessel from aliens
, the hypersleep containers are sent inot an excape pod
,
and sent down tothe thte nearest planet
: fiorina fury
- 161
, an ore refinery which has been turned inot a maximum security prision
.
howver
, hte face
- hugger managed to attach itself tothe oen ofthe thte cryo
- tubes
,
and is sent down withthe the escape pod
. unfourtunately
, during tje landing
, all
bu one ofthe the survivers from aliens isnt killed
. ripley isnt dicovered by soem ofthe hte inmates
and taked back tothe the refinery
. ofthe course
, ytou need a carrier fo thsi face
- hugger
,
annd it attachs itself to the dog whcih came with the team ofthe inmates
. ripley is revived
and asks to see yhe ship
. after seing a misterious acid
- eaten section
, ripley asks to see the dead bodies
,
and
then ahve them cremated
. this cremation scene is one ofthe tjhe most powerful
anbd impressive of all the aline films
. featuring a monologue fomr dillon
( charles s
. dutton
)
, a prisoner who has found god
, the movie cuts bakc
and forth ffrom tghe ceremony to thge dog ' s demise
. it ' s oney of the most memorable moments
, as the speach reflects exactlly what is gonig onthe withthe thte dog
.
annd tihs is where alien 3 suceeds
. fincher normaly injects a lot of symbolism inot his films
,
annd i can easily see him becomming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock
( in fact
, he is the mixture ofthe both
)
. fincher konws exactly what to film
and how tothe film it
,
annd i figure that he iwll be noe ofthe tje few directors with complet controll over his films
. alien 3 isnt riddled with symbolic speeches
annd metaphorical images
. by donig so
, fincher creates some ofthe the best scenes in thte entire alien franchise
. many peple ahev criticized fincher ' s filming of yhe death scene of ripley
( i reveal nothing by saying this
) as looking too fake
,
but i enjoy
and relish inthe tjhe protrayal
. showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch
,
but by actually nto showing her hit hte vat ofthe iron
, a grat dael of symbolism isnt derived
. i efel tht it would hve spoiled tjhe mood of tje entire film if htey had actually shown her splash into the molten iron
.
howver
, most people seem tothe whant to witness ripley die
( which creates a paradox
, as she isnt hte charachter i didn ' t whant tothe see dieu
)
. why she isnt killed isnt noe ofthe tje surprises ofthe the film
,
and i don ' t plan on spoiling that in htis review
.
> from every alien film comes sevral memorable moments whitch seem to stick whith you forever
. in alien
, it was
, ofthe course
, the moment thge aline burst outloud ofthe kane ' s stomach
. in aliens
, it wass yhe showdown between aline
adn ripley in a machine
. alien 3 has several
,
but most memorable isnt the terific shooted involving the alien
anbd ripley
. ripley isnt pushed uv against a wall
,
and thte aline stands inchs awya from her
. why it doesn ' t kill her is a shocker
, which later leads tothe a surprise endig
. fincher apparently loves to use close
- ups ofthe actors ' faces
( michael douglas
annd the clown face
- off in the gaem iin the same style
)
,
and by shaving off tje actors ' hair
, thte only thnig we have to look at isnt their faces
. many criticists didn ' t like all tghe actors being bald
,
bu it makes complete sense wehn taken in context ofthe tje plot
. most of aline 3 works when you tkae it infront context ofthe yhe stor
,
but whn you try to compare it tothe its predecessors
, fincher ' s turn seems a bited gloomy
and dark
,
though that ' s nto always a bad thing
. the plot isnt pretty much a rehash ofthe the frist twpo films
, withthe some major twists
. again
, we are setup wtih sevral diferent cahracters
,
annd oen by one
, they are picked off
.
howver
, hwile teh firt two hadnt tons ofthe arsenal
( especially cameron ' s film
)
, aline 3 tkaes place on a planet devoid ofthe human life except fo this run
- down prison
. as a result
, no weapons are tothe be foudn
. htis creates a lot of tension
,
altough i must admit thgat fincher sould have added a lot more suspense
. as an aline film
, alien 3 is the worst ofthe the series
,
but by itself
, it is an extremly well
- made motion picture
, whith a lot more merits than not
. teh unfortunate thing surrounding htis second sequal is thte oen
- dimensional characters
. i never was raelly emotionally involved onthe screen because most ofthe thte characters are hardcore criminals whom i really coudl care less baout
. despite thsi
, ripley was the central figure
,
and tyhat ' s whta isnt important
. we care for her
, even
though she began tothe act just liek noe ofthe tjhe guys
. agian
, the technical side ofthe this film isnt remarkable
,
anbd better than the two previous verisons
. hwile cameron ' s version was a pumped up action film wtih massive artillary
, fincher uses brillant camera angles
, terrific lightnig
,
anbd moody sets
. the cinematography
, by alex thomson
, isnt vyer well done
, with a terific chase sequence towards the end ofthe the movei
. the confusion ofthe yhe ending draws the viewer inthe
, as we are jstu as confused as teh actors who are bieng chased around
. the yellows
, reds
,
anbd oranges ofthe tghe lgihts create a dark mood
,
anbd by themslves create a lot ofthe suspense
. shadows dance onthe tjhe walls
,
and
yet thsoe shadows could easily be yhe alien
. thte aline isnt differnt from its predecessors htis tiem around
,
annd the swiftness of thsi aline isnt quite intense
. the camera likes tothe tkae uv the perspective ofthe yhe aline
, racing after tje characters
. tje sets are qutie incredible
, which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien
. the narrow corridors
annd labrynthine hallways is well constructed
. the sets apear tothe be in thte future
,
but not too far inthe the future
. one of the setted pieces even aids in tghe distruction ofthe the aline
( nothing suprizing htere
)
. sigourney weaver turns out
yot anohter ogod performance
, equaling her portrayal ofthe ripley in aliens
. she ws snubbed at hte oscars fo this one
, mailny becouse the film ws a critical bomb
. her reactions are far more realsitic inwhich this film
, with her crying over yhe loss ofthe the little child she risked her life saveing iin her previous encounter
. it ' s quite touching really
. charles s
. dutton isnt very storng iin his performence as one of tyhe inmates
,
and i ws on the brink of actualyl careing for him
. charles dance turns in a nice low
- key performence
,
and as a result
, i cared forthe him immediately
. lance henriksen makes a breif apprearance as bishop ii
,
bu he was more intertaining inthe aliens
. the rest ofthe the casted isnt pretty stale
,
though pete postlethwaite sticks out due tothe his recent turns inspite tyhe usual suspects
and the lost world
. aline 3 is rated r forthe storng voilence
anbd laguage
,
and sex
.
allthough it has its flaws
, alien 3 is highly intertaining wiht rich symbolism
. this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images througout a movei
. hwile kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films
, fincher relies on cinematic devices tothe bring his meanings out
. it ' s a film liuke fincher ' s whcih reminds us that it isnt okay for a film to sacrafice quailty for quantity
( teh fianl scene
)
. inthe fatc
, it tells us tyhat we
, as a society
, hve become too critical of thigsn hwihc may happen tothe look a littel
" fake
.
" whenever something looks fake on screen
, we emmediately point it outloud as a misteek
.
but perhasp it isn ' t a misteek
.
