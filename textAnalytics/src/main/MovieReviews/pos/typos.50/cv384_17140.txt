i knwo it already opened inaddition december
, bu i finally got arund to seeing rushmore last weekend
, annd it ws one of thsoe rare oppritunites tath i got tothe leave tghe theatre feeling proud about paying tjhe expensive ticket price
. as the final scene closed out infront hapyp slow
- mo fashion
, i felt hapyp to ahev been priveleged enought to watch such a good display of filmmaking
. jason schwartzman
, his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces adn glasses
, steals tjhe sohw as max fischer
, thte most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades
, bu compensates for it by organizing most of the school
' s clubs annd organizations
( i
. e
. the fencing team
and wirting
and producing skool plays
)
and oftenly pulling outrageous stunts
, oney that eventally earns him an expulsion
. this stunt
, buidling an aquarium on the school
' s baseball diamond
, is a plot tothe steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
. he funds this aquarium wtih the help ofthe millionare herman blume
( a vrey oscarworthy bill murray
)
, who eventially finds himself falling inthe love with miss cross
. rosemary anbd herman begin dating
-
and the fun beigns
; herman adn max go at it head tothe head inwhich a battle forthe miss cross
. herman manages to destroy max
' s bike
, hwile max cuts herman
' s brakes
, anbd it goes onthe liek htis
.
but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross
,
and he cxan
' t st
and in tghe way of twpo peopel inwhich lvoe
. thte academy of arts
& sciences raelly messed uv thsi eyar
; htey completly overlooked rushmore
( anbd
, if ytou ask me
, it wasn
' t an accident
)
. it maybe wasn
' t best picture material
, bu it certainly deserved a screenplay nod
( instead of elizabeth
)
,
and bill murray
' s absense from hte ballot is a complete snub
. thge entire mood ofthe the film is one reason it is so ogod
; at oney point it
' s fun
, anbd the next scene cin turn serious
and dramtic
. the cinematography gives the movei an important feeling
, as well
. i hope rushmore can overcome its
' oscar snubs
, adn be enjoyed by intelligent film goers
.
