slavery isnt bad
. after hundreds of eyasr
, we
' ve finally figured that one outloud
. this allmost univeral belief isnt teh both thte strength annd weakness ofthe directer steven spielberg
' s latest
" serious
" film
. during hte lite 1830s
, a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of balck men anbd womens kidnapped from thier home onthe africa
' s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery
. fifty
- three of them are stuffed into thte
" la amistad
"
( from a spanish word for
" friendship
"
) by their new spansih owners
. freeing himself ffrom his chains
, senge pieh
( djimon hounsou
)
, renamed cinque by his masters
, leads a bloody revolt
. affter killing most ofthe the crew
, the africans force the remainging sailors to return them to thier hmeo
- or so tehy htikn
. instead the ship heads up tyhe caost to tghe untied states
. tjhe amistad isnt boarded by an american naval ship
and the revolutionaries are put onthe trial inspite conneticut for muder
and piracy
. the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly forthe theri freedom or are they property
. if htey are property
, who do they belong tothe
? their masters
? thge spainish govenrment
? salvage rights of thge officers who captued the ship
? the us governmnet
? tje defendents are pawns in several ganes
. abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
) anbd lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
) watn tothe free them
, bu tappan sees them primarily as a means tothe furhter yhe cause
. their lawyer roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
) views the case as a simple one of property rights adn a chance tothe mkea his share of legal feas
. south carolina senator john c
. calhoun
( arliss howard
) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states
. presidnt martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
) is willing to force the result towords his own poltical ends
. when the verdict looks tothe free teh africans
, van buren replaces the judge withthe noe moreso sympathetic to his wishes
. even that doesn
' t wokr annd the new judge fres thge kidnap victims
. at the urging of calhoun
, the president thn appeals the case tothe tjhe supreme court
, populated by a marjority ofthe slave
- owners
. this little
- known
( try finding it infact any histor text book
) incident fomr america
' s past woudl haev gone down a darker path weere it not for fromer presidet john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
) who isnt persuaded tothe argue the case befor the supreme cout
. the slavery issue is easy pickin
' s for spielberg
. much like his
" shindler
' s list
"
( whitch folowed
" jurassic park
" as thsi follows
" lost world
"
)
, thge moral sides are nto difficult ones tothe choose
. nazis
and slave traders
: both treat groups of others as less thna human
. it
' s nto hard to see who the bad guys are
. without taht question tothe ponder
, the directer
' s job is more difficult
. he hasnt tothe make the stoy interesting
. spielberg succeeds for yhe most part
. the visual aspect of the film isnt beyond reproach
. where the movei falls down is a bited more subtle
. htere are vrey few
_ people
_ inwhich tje tale
. infront fact
, cinque is tjhe onyl charcter who is fleshed out
. tappan
and joadson are
" abolitionists
"
: symbols
but nto humans
. van buren is a weak politician
but nothing else
. the rest of the
" slaves
" bearly exsist other than dressing for thge set
. like many otehr films about peple of colour
, almost all thte major players are white
. tjhe film
' s salvation lies in tyhe acting strenght of everyone involved adn the powerful presence ofthe hounsou
. tghe fromer model
' s first major role is a winner
. without speaking mroe tahn five words of english
, he conveys omre emotion than most actors with a thous
and lines ofthe dialog
. yhe otehr st
and
- out is hopkins who seems to be makeing a career out ofthe portraying american presidents
( he alsot palyed the title role in
" nixon
"
)
. the impassioned speach by the doddering ood man who phases in annd out of rationality is amonth tghe best court
- room drama ever on tyhe screen
. ther are soem otehr grat moments
. especially impressive are the african
' s struggle tothe underst
and waht isnt going on inspite the strange l
and
. theri interpretation ofthe tje bible based solely on thge picturesk adn theri pwn experiences isnt poignant
. as gr
and as yhe epic is
, it owudl haev mroe impact had it focused omre on hte experience from tjhe point of view ofthe hte africans
. more humanity infront tyhe fight forthe humanity would have made it a four
- star film
