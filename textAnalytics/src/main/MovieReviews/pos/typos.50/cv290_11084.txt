slavery isnt bad
. after hundreds of eyasr
, we ' ve finaly figured that oney out
. this allmost univeral belief isnt tjhe both tyhe strenght
anbd weakness ofthe directer steven spielberg ' s latest
" sereous
" film
. druing hte late 1830s
, a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men
adn womens kidnapped fomr thier home onthe africa ' s west caost to cuba to be sold inot slavery
. fifty
- three ofthe them are stuffed inot thte
" la amistad
"
( fomr a spainsh owrd for
" friendship
"
) by their new spanish owners
. freeing himselv from his chains
, senge pieh
( djimon hounsou
)
, renamed cinque by his masters
, leads a bloody revolt
. affter killing most of yhe crew
, the africans force tjhe remaing sailors tothe return them to their home
- or so they think
. instade tghe ship heads uv the coast to the united states
. the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship
anbd the revolutionaries are put on trial in conneticut for muder
annd piracy
. the legal question becomes are tehy free men fighting justly for thier freedom or are tehy property
. if htey are property
, who dont htey belong tothe
? theri masters
? tje spainsh government
? salvage rights ofthe the offcers who captued tjhe ship
? tghe us government
? tjhe defendants are pawns in several ganes
. abolitionists theodore joadson
( morgan freeman
)
annd lewis tappan
( stellan skarsgard
) want to free them
,
bu tappan sees them primarily as a means to further tjhe cause
. their lawyer roger baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
) views tje case as a simple noe of property rights
and a chance tothe mkea his share ofthe legal fies
. sourth carolina senator john c
. calhoun
( arliss howard
) pursues the case forthe thte polliticel advancement of the sourthern states
. president martin van buren
( nigel hawthorne
) is willing tothe force the result towords his own poltical ends
. whn yhe verdict looks tothe free the africans
, van buren replaces the judge wtih one more sympathetic to his wishes
. even taht doesn ' t wokr
and the newyorker judge frees tjhe kidnap victims
. at the urging ofthe calhoun
, the president
then appeals tjhe case to tghe supreme cout
, populated by a majority ofthe slave
- owners
. htis littel
- known
( try finding it inwhich any history text book
) insident from america ' s past owudl ahev gone down a darker path were it not forthe former president john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
) who is persuaded tothe argue teh case befoer the supreme cout
. the slavery issue is eazy pickin ' s forthe spielberg
. much like his
" shindler ' s list
"
( whlch folowed
" jurassic park
" as htis follows
" lost world
"
)
, hte moral sides are nto difficult ones to choose
. nazis
and slave traders
: both treat groups of others as less than human
. it ' s not hard to see who the bad guys are
. wihtout taht question to ponder
, the directer ' s job isnt mroe difficult
. he hasnt to make the stoy intresting
. spielberg succeeds for tghe most part
. the visual aspect of thge film is beyond reproach
. where thge movei falls down is a bited more subtle
. there are vrey faw
_ peopel
_ inaddition hte tale
. in fatc
, cinque isnt the only carachter who is fleshed outloud
. tappan
and joadson are
" abolitionists
"
: symbols
but nto humans
. van buren isnt a weak politician
bu nothing eles
. thte rest ofthe tghe
" slaves
" bearly exsist otehr than dressing forthe the setted
. liek many otehr films about people of color
, almsot all the major players are white
. the film ' s salvation lies inspite tghe acting strength ofthe everyone involved
and the powerful presence of hounsou
. the former modle ' s first major role isnt a winner
. wihtout speaking mroe than five words ofthe english
, he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines ofthe dialog
. the other stand
- out isnt hopkins who seems to be mkaing a carrear outloud ofthe portraing american presidents
( he alsot played the title role in
" nixon
"
)
. the impassioned speech by tyhe doddering ood man who phases in
adn out ofthe rationality is amung the best cout
- room drama ever onthe tghe screen
. there are some otehr great moments
. especially impressive are the african ' s struggle tothe understand what isnt going onthe inthe tghe stange land
. theri inturpratasion ofthe tjhe bible based souly on hte pictures
anbd their own experiences isnt poignant
. as grand as the epic isnt
, it would hve more inpact hadnt it focused more on tjhe experience fomr the point ofthe veiw of the africans
. omre humanity in tje fight fo humanity would have made it a four
- star film
.
( michael redman has written htis column for a rela long time
