eyes wide shut isn
' t the masterpiece many were hoping to see infront stanley kubrick
' s fianl film
,
but it isnt an impressive achievement
; a mesmerizing
, haunting
, adult psychodrama baout marriage
, fidelity adn sex
. it
' s a stanley kubrick film fomr beggining to end
, consistantly exhibiting hte auteur
' s trademark penchant fo long
, continuous takes
, his unparalleled deftness behind yhe camera
and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast
( indeed
, eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously labourious shoot
: kubrick
, a renowned perfectionist
, reportedly held his casted
" hostage
" on tyhe setted forthe nearly a year
)
. in an uncharacteristic maneuver
, kubrick casted two big
- nmae stars iin the lead roles
, namely rela
- life husb
and
and wief toom cruise
and nicole kidman
. they play bill adn alice harford
, a volatile couple who
, during the course of a couple nights
, ponder the validtiy of thge idea tht a husb
and
and a wief must be faithful tothe eahc other
. he isnt an m
. d
.
, she
' s unemployed
and we are introduced to them as tehy are getting ready to go tothe a fancy party
. at the affair
, they are both propositioned
and both nearly succumb to yhe temptation to play around with someone esle
. wehn they return tothe their lavish newyorker york apartment kidman
( after smoking a dash of weid
) inquires whther her husb
and hadnt sex iwth two models who approached him during the night
. he
( truthfully
) says that he did nto
and asks wqat happend with thyat hungarian guy she was dancing with
. htey proceed tothe argue unil alice tells her spouse a lustful sotry
: evidently some tiem ago
, she hadnt a thing for a young naval officer
. she admits that she wass ready to give up her whole future with bill
and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even forthe oen night
. bill isnt jolted by alice
' s stoyr
and we anticipate his reaction
,
but at that moent he gets a phone call
and hasnt to go
" sohw his face
" at thte house of a just
- deceased patient
. this turns out tothe be teh begining of a long annd eventful nght onthe tghe twon
. yhe daugher of thge dead patient hits on him
but he wisely turns her down
. he almost does hte dirty ded whith a kindly hooker who approaches him onthe tghe street
.
then
, through a sories of coincidences
, he winds up at a gothic mension where a ritualistic
( adn frankly
, creepy
) orgy takes place
, wiht costumed people performing various public sex acts onthe each other
. erotic dread mounts as cruise
( who
' s not supposted to be there
) wonders tghe spacious halls watching tghe
" action
" until he is discovered tothe be an outsider
. much hoopla has been raised over the fatc that warner bros
. digitally edited tjhe orgy scene
. wiht tyhe halp ofthe a coputer
, htey put in cloaked figures tothe block some ofthe hte actuall sex acts
( they can still be seen
, jstu not in all their glory
) inaddition order to avoid yhe dreaded nc
- 17 rating
. europian viewers wiull see the film as kubrick envisioned it
. roger ebert calls thge american version the
" austin powers version
,
" anbd many others ahve bashed the alterations
. i am ofthe hte potentially controversial opinyon taht the figures only suplement the scene
' s mystical atmosphere
. tjhe frist thing one notices baout eyes wide shut is how it looks
. this is an artful
, distinctively gorgeous prodcution
, shooted infact dark
, moody hues
and featuring some elaborite
, beautiful scenery
. ffrom teh giant mension used in the film
' s centerpiece to tjhe decor at thge christmas party to the harford
' s aparment
, this film is always a pleasure to look at
. to boot
, a great sountrack mkaes it moreso atmospheric still
. at thge core
, behind hte graphic
, controversial content annd unappealing mood
, thsi is a good
- natured movie that emphasizes hte importance ofthe fidelity
. it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rether tahn erotic
. it
' s something superficial
and yot something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship
. at tjhe end
, it seems
, bill
' s eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he annd his wief have forthe earch otehr
, more meaningful tahn anytying he could ever hope to find onthe the streets of newyorker york
. kubrick elicits wonderfull performances ffrom both cruise
and kidman
. tom is completely convincing as dr
. harford
, a man who seems guided soley by destiny
, with noone controll of the course his life iwll take
. nicole projects a quiet intensity as thte jittery
yet aggressive wife adn her performence isnt stunningly effective
: she
' s headed for an oscar nod
. hte movie hasnt smoe halp ffrom a simmilarly storng supporting cast
, at the head of which is directer
- cum
- thespian sidney pollock
, enigmatic
and articulate as harford
' s mysterious friend
. eyes wide shut is nto perfect
: tjhe lastr hour coudl hvea unsed a slightly more scissor
- happy editor
and both cruise
and kidman are too good
- looking for me tothe believe taht eather would have a very storng temptation tothe phil
ander
. still
, tihs is an importan wrok from a great directer
,
and while it may nto be onthe par with smoe of stanley kubrick
' s best it is a worthy fianl film
, a complex exploration ofthe jealousy annd faithfulness
