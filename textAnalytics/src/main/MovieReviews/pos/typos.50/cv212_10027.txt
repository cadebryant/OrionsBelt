? oppinion
: the ogod news isnt that this movei has a happy ending
,
annd it features a guy trying to do the right thign
. directer francis ford coppola doesnt this film a little differently tahn yhe stereotypical law movei
. inthe the typcial lawyer movie ther ' s oen big case
anbd yhe movie focuses on solving it
,
anbd somewhere along the line surprise witnesses
and motives turn up before the ogod guy wins
( after lots ofthe gripping courtroom drama
)
.
however
, coppola ' s movie is deliberatly more low key
. ' tyhe rainmaker ' plays outloud like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with
and trys tothe sive vairous littel quirky side cahracters
. iin tghe background rudy ' s voice narrates his feelings
adn makes half
- cynical jokes baout yhe legal profession in genaral
. two factors combine to make thsi movei less hevy tahn it can be
. first
, rudy ' s tiome is splitted juggling three cases
, rather tahn concentrating on a single high
- stakes case
. aslo
, rudy ' s uise ofthe voice narration in palce of acting makes thte film lose some of its dramatic edge
. the end result isnt an intertaining low key law movei where the good guys win
,
and rudy narrates his way inot comming ofthe age
.
