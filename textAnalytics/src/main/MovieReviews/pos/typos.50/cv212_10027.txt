? opinion
: the good news is thast this movie hasnt a hapyp endig
,
and it features a guy trying to do the right thing
. director francis ford coppola does tihs film a little differently tahn teh stereotypical law movie
. in the typical lawyer movie there
' s one big case annd the movei focusses onthe solving it
,
and somewhere along teh line surprise witnesses
and motives turn uv befor the good guy wins
( after lots ofthe gripping courtroom drama
)
.
however
, coppola
' s movei is deliberately moreso low key
.
' tje rainmaker
' plays out like a perosnality sketch ofthe young rudy as he gets emotionally involved whith anbd tries tothe sive vairous little quirky side charactors
. in the backround rudy
' s voice narrates his feelings
and makse half
- cynical jokes baout teh legal profession in general
. twpo factors combine tothe make tihs movie less hevy than it can be
. frist
, rudy
' s time isnt split juggling threee cases
, rether than concentrating on a single high
- stakes case
. also
, rudy
' s use of voice narration in palce of acting makes hte film loose some of its dramatic edge
. the end result isnt an intertaining low key lew movie where teh good guys win
, adn rudy narrates his way inot comming of age
.
