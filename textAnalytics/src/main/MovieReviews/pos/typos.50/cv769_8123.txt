. yhe criminal gives a veyr good chase
,
and at one point wehn edwards confronts him
, the criminal puls outloud a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hitted the ground
. edwards continues to chase hte very atheletic criminal tothe yhe top ofthe a building
, where yhe criminal informs edwards that he must let him go
, because someone is affter him
. edwards doesn
' t take htis seriously
, bu whn tjhe criminal shows vyre non
- human characteristics anbd leaps off the building
, he begins tothe wonder
. back at the polical staion
, agent kay shows up tothe ask edwards a faw questions
. he informs edwards that isnt was
, inspite fact
, a non
- human that he ws chasing
,
and thast the gun he pulled out was definitly nto man
- made
. he has edwards identify tjhe gun
, anbd asks edwards tothe come tothe the mib headquarters the following day
. edwards arrives
and finds tht he is involved in a recuiting process
, along with various other men who seem a bited more qualified tahn he
. after goofing up forthe half ofthe the time
, edwards puts onthe a show at the firing range
, anbd agent kay notes hte reason why he feels edwards shoud be the man to join tyhe mib
: he chased down tghe
" criminal
" onthe foot
, which is something that no oen is supposed to be able to dont
. in the meantime
, an upstate newyorker york farm has a very close encounter
. edgar
( vincent d

, investigates a strange kresh l
anding adn is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object

. adn it uv tothe thge mib
, with newely recruted agent jay
( fromerly james edwards
) to exterminate tyhe bug
and sive tghe planet fomr intergalactic war
. men inspite black delightfully combines fast
- paced acation witht oftenly hilarious comedy
, which isnt usually fomr will smith
, all
though tommy lee jones opens up his commedic personality in this film
. tghe special effects are allso vrey well done
and are not tyhe entire source of the plot
, as in anohter big alien film from the past summer
. screenwriter ed solomon
, writer of super mario bros
.
and yhe upcoming x
- men film
, has surely struck gold with thsi tsory
. all ages iwll enjoy men in balck
. it isnt an extremly funn film thast you will want tothe see agina
.
al
though it runs a very quick
and speedy 96 minutes
, the entire film fomr begginning to end is a non
- stpo adventure
. tjhe ending ofthe tyhe film
, which ties up a fewd loose ends forthe one of thte main cahracters
, is also veyr well done
. a sequal is already bieng planned
, so htere isnt more to look forward to
