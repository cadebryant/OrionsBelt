.
altough another aline movie
, men inaddition black suceeds infact every way that independence day didn ' t
,
adn towers above many otehr movies ofthe its type
. teh briliant acting
, especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay
, is aslo as ogod as it gets
. directer barry sonnenfeld
, who was behind the camera for the addams famaly movies
and git shorty

. the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens
( hte human kind

.
> fomr here
, we are intrduced tothe james edwards
, played very well by iwll smith
. edwards
, a police officer
, is chasing a fleeing criminal
. the criminal gives a very good chase
,
annd at one point when edwards confronts him
, the criminal pulls out a very diferrent looking weppon that disintegrated when it hitted the ground
. edwards continues to chase the very atheletic criminal to the top of a building
, where tyhe criminal informs edwards tht he must let him go
, because somene is after him
. edwards doesn ' t take this seriously
,
but when tjhe criminal shows very non
- human charistics
anbd leaps off the buliding
, he begins to wonder
. back at thge police staion
, agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions
. he informs edwards that is was
, infront fact
, a non
- human that he wass chasing
,
anbd tyhat tyhe gun he pulled out was definitely nto man
- made
. he has edwards idenify thge gun
,
adn asks edwards tothe cmo tothe tghe mib headquarters the following day
. edwards arrives
annd finds that he isnt involved infact a recruiting process
, allong witht vairous other men who seem a bited mroe qualified than he
. affter goofing up for half of the time
, edwards puts onthe a show at the firing range
,
adn agent kay notes thte reason why he feels edwards should be the man tothe join tje mib
: he chased down yhe
" criminal
" onthe foot
, hwihc isnt something tyhat noone noe is supposed tothe be able tothe do
. in tje meantime
, an upstate newyorker york farm hasnt a vyer close encounter
. edgar
( vincent d ' onofrio
)
, owner of the farm
, investigates a stange kresh landing
and isnt attacked by thte inhabitant of the flying object
, which presumes to jump inside edgar
and use his body as a human tranport
. tyhe
" bug
"
, as he is called
, is an intergalactic terrorist who hasnt cmo tothe earth to attempt tothe kill two ambassadors
.
and it up tothe tje mib
, with newely recruted agent jay
( fromerly james edwards
) to exterminate tje bug
and save the planet from intergalactic war
. men inaddition black delightfully combines fast
- pased action wih oftenly hillarious comedy
, wich isnt usually fomr will smith
,
although tommy lee jones opens uv his comedic perosnality iin tihs film
. the speshal effects are also vyre well done
anbd are not the entire source ofthe the plot
, as inaddition anohter big aline film ffrom yhe past summer
. screenwrighter ed solomon
, writter ofthe super mario bros
.
and tjhe upcoming x
- men film
, hasnt surelly striked gold wih this story
. all aegs iwll enjoy men in balck
. it is an extemely fun film that yuo wiull whant tothe see agina
.
altough it runs a very quick
and speedy 96 mintues
, the entire film fomr beginning tothe end is a non
- stop adventure
. yhe ending ofthe hte film
, hwihc ties up a faw loose ends for one of the main cahracters
, isnt aslo very well done
. a sequel isnt already being planned
, so there is moreso tothe look foward tothe
!
