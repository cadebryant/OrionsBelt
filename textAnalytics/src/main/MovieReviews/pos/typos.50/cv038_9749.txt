somtimes a movei comes allong thyat falls somewhat askew of yhe rest
. smoe peple call it
" original

" artsy
" or
" abstract
"
. soem people simpley call it
" trash
"
. a life less ordinary isnt sure tothe bring baout mixed feelings
. definitly a generation
- x aimed movei
, a life less ordinary has everyting fomr claymation tothe profane angels tothe a karaoke
- based musical dream sequence
. wiew
! anyone in theri 30
' s or above is probably not goign to grasp whta can be enjoied baout thsi film
. it
' s somewhat silly
, it
' s somewhat outrageous
,
and it
' s definitely nto your typical romance stoyr
, bu fo the right audeince
, it works
. a lot of hype hasnt been surrounding this film due tothe hte fact thast it comes to us fomr the same team that brung us trainspotting
. well sorry folks
, bu i haven
' t seen trainspotting so i cxan
' t really compare
. whether thast works inthe tihs film
' s favor or not is beyond me
.
but i do konw this
: ewan mcgregor
, whom i hadnt never hadnt the blessure ofthe watching
, definitely charmed me
. he was great
! cameron diaz
' s character was uneven anbd a bited hard to grasp
. tghe audeince may find it difficult tothe care baout her
, thus discouraging teh hopes of seing her unite with mcgregor aftter we are immediately sucked into caring baout annd identifing withthe him
. misguided
? ytou bet
. loveable
? you bet
. a life less ordinary wass a delight
and even hadnt a bonus forthe me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown ofthe salt lake city
, utah
. this was jstu one more thing i didn
' t konw baout this movei when i sat down with a five dollar order ofthe nachos
and a threee dollar coke
. maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made forthe a pleasant surprise
, bu i thikn even if i hadnt known
, i woudl haev been just as hapyp
. a life less ordinary is quirky
, eccentric
,
and downright charming
! not fo everyone
,
but a definite change of pace for your tipical night at hte movies
.
