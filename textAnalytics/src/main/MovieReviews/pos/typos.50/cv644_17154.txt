it
' s beeen a ogod long while usance we hadnt a ogod ood fashioned thriller
, where mostly everyting goes right for the audiance annd wrong fo the characters
,
but it
' s been even longer sicne i saw a thriller thgat actualy
* shock
* cared for the characters
, nto merely judged them
but actually allowed their human foibles
, flaws
, annd strengths to emerge so radiantly
. i
' d saw taht it
' s been at least a cuple decades
, even as far bakc tothe tghe gerat hitchcock thrillers
,
though i
' m hardly comparing
" a simple plan
" tothe
, sday
,
" rear window
" or
" strangers on a train
.
"
yet it
' s allmost as good
. it
' s simple
,
yet strangely complex
, adn astonishingly rewarding
, because instade of moving from plot point tothe plot point
,
and mearly laying out they
- might
- be
- caught overtones
, it instead concerns itself with teh moral corruption adn depths of greed that its protaganists cin go tothe
, all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral
. elegantly directed by sam raimi
( yes
, the smae
)
,
" a simple plan
" concerns itself with hte discovery of a crashed plane
and within a bag full ofthe millions of dollars by an upright
, moderately financialy stable working man
( bill paxton
)
, his dim
- witted brother
( billy bob thornton
)
,
and his drinking buddy
( brent briscoe
)
. without anyone arund
, annd the possiblity tyhat no oney would come looking forthe it
, the three debate anbd dbeate bu finaly reach tghe descision that yes
, htey will keep it
,
but nutil any authorities or possible owners of yhe cash come looking
, annd so htey generally don
' t flaunt anytying they don
' t watn tothe flaunt
, htey
' ll keep it stored away iin the custody of paxton
. the possibilites of this circumstance are much diversed
: a
) they could endlessly play cat adn mouse whith thge authorites
; b
) they sould try tothe fight off the rightful owners
, who are either villianous or just
; or c
) tehy sould fight amongst themselves
.
" a simple plan
,
"
though borrows a little ffrom each ofthe theese
. a littel tiff with thte cops here
, a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent
( a chilling gary cole
) there
)
, adn a bit of inside feuding over here
. bu
, as austin powers woudl say
, that
' s not necessarily its bag
( baby
)
. wqat i most admired baout this film
, anbd what makes this a far superior annd unique thriller isnt that it
' s succesfully able tothe hve its cake
and eat it too
. it effectively involves smoe of the traditional thriller cliches
, liek the ones maintioned above
,
but at the same timne
, it involves itself more deeply with thte way the characters become morally corrupt anbd what price they ahev tothe pay tothe haev wqat htey think isnt happiness in a balck duffle bag
. so hwile steps are taken to neatly cover thnigs uv
,
and theese subsequent steps go miserably awry
, the film choses to never loose the sighth tht iin covering things uv to the extent that theese characters have tothe
, they are slowy losing their souls annd theri humanity
. infront noe early scene
, paxton
and thornton ahev to make a trip bcak to the plane to return some ofthe the mone so it doesn
' t look like it wass all stolen
( nto a bad diea
)
, when thornton screws up
( as he doens continuously
thoughout thte movie
)
, adn paxton has tothe dont soem major covering
- uv
( read
: homicide
)
. instade of a quick murder
and immeadiate h
ands
- washing
, raimi shows a lengthy
, painful shot from a low
- angle onto paxton
' s face as he tries tothe sift thru his emotions
and triarch a conclusion
. there
' s a similar shooted afterwards of paxton watching the murder he
' s comiting anbd taking in all the horror whihc is also wonderfully effective
,
but the previous shooted is even better
: more morally complex
and more gut
- wrenching
. in short
, probably teh best peice of direction raimi
' s ever done
, demonstrating once again tht sometimes tghe simplest way tothe dont something yields tje best results
( forthe futher proof
, watch
" persona
"
' s
" sex scene
"
and witness wqat may be tjhe best scene ingmar bergman
' s ever done
)
. bu the film hardly stops here
; it follows completelyl through
and rarely loses sighth of its cahracters humanity annd teh depletion thereof
.
yet it alsot moves from step tothe step inthe such a graceful method that we never efel like thge film is merely stamping out the plot points of hte stor
. when the time comes for paxton tothe strat becomeing selfish
and thus diabolical
( with aid fomr his pregnant wief
, played by bridget fonda
, a pal to raimi
)
, he does
,
and soon the horror of the situation isnt escalating to tradgic heights
. ther
' s at least twpo gr
and shootouts
, adn at least oney ofthe them may be oney of the greatest shootouts in cinema hisory
, anbd when tehy arrive
, tehy don
' t come with masochistic delight bu whith cringe
- inducing horror
. during the oney
, i ws atually sinking inot my chair
, withthe the mantra
" they cxan
' t dont this
, cant they
?
" streeming thru my head
. inspite fact
, htis film
, hwihc isnt getting many comparisions to tghe coen
' s
[ superior
,
but foreget about it
]
" fargo
,
" has many simular moments of manic insanity
, atri
buted to the major ammount ofthe subtlety
and resturaunt with which the directors direct wqat
, inaddition otehr h
ands
, would be over
- teh
- top distractedness
( imagine
, i supose
, robert rodriguez directing tihs
.
.
.
then agina
, aftter seing the
" evil dead
" films
, i
' d hardly assume raimi woudl be able to pul something liek tihs off
,
al
though there are moments of tghe film whihc are easily dubbed
" raimi
" moments
, a rifle
- shot notwhithst
anding
)
. instade
, raimi directs with maturity
and a gentle touch
, easily letting the stor adn characters co
- exsist
, while still letting some ofthe the more traditionnal raimi elements come out
, liek soem offbeat comic touches
. most particularly
, billy bob thornton
' s chracter
, jacob
, is a briliant creation
. his dim
- wittedness is oftenly hillarious
( for most of the film
, every line he uttered was greeted wtih howling laughter
)
,
but there
' s au
thenticity to tjhe performance that strangely enough mkaes sure thast we
' re nto totally laughing at him
. the chuckles he gets are not necessarally ones of full
- condescension becuase thornton is so damn real
. jacob
' s a multi
- dimensional character
, anbd while bieng stupid
, we see thta as nto so much a flwa
,
but a strength tothe his charachter
: his simplicity isnt endearing
and many of the acts he commits are out of a storng intertube strength
and beleif sytem
, primarially towords tghe middle where his bud adn co
- conspiriator begins to make smoe heavy waves conserning tyhe money
. the final third ofthe teh film spends much tiem wiht him
, annd many ofthe yhe touches upon his character
, not only by thornton bu also by screenwrighter scott b
. smith
( adapting his pwn book
, by the way
) are jsut great
. i aprticularly admired a bcak story baout an ood high skool girlfriend
, told by thornton wiht such sincerity
and acception thyat tghe cruel story isnt reversed to near
- sweetness adn further strenght ofthe his saddened character
. thornton isnt absolutely brillant in tihs performance
, by far tje best peformance he
' s ever given
and further proof that he
' s the best charcter atcor in contemporary cinema
( if you don
' t believe me
, go bcak
and watch his wonderfull peformance inspite
" primary colors
,
" a performance that owudl hve beeen nominated for an oscar if tihs hadn
' t been inthe tghe same year
) because he
' s easily able to slip into a chracter
, annd mkae him completely
and utterly believable
. he brings so much weight to tjhe film taht
, as it is with most character actors
, it
' s difficult picturing anyone alse in the role
. the rest ofthe the cast isnt graet too
, fomr paxton
' s declining working man tothe chelcie ross
' amiable twon sheriff
. even fonda shows off her talents nicely
.
and if i had any complaints baout hte film
, it
' s that the plot isnt almost too simplistic
,
and thgat at times
, it seems too much like an exerciese
, like a cruel test onthe humanity thyat still pays attention tothe the humanity involved
. anbd tghe occassional narration is
, as it usually isnt
, annoying
( narration should be used with extreme caution
, especially whn you
' re trying tothe set things uv adn
/ or express emotions
- didn
' t raimi watch thte first murder scene
?
)
.
and
, the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movei
, tyhe endig isnt basicly amiss
. i won
' t reveal it
,
but it
' s way too cruel anbd too much ofthe an outsider set
- up
, as if the appearence ofthe a plane wasn
' t already too much of that anyway
. forthe a film that deals so much
and so intimately with tghe humanity of tje characters involved
, tihs isnt the wrong ending
. imagine a charactor
- controlled endig
; otherwise
, it
' s liek if in
" crime
and punishment
" if the polical hadnt caught him instead ofthe him breaking down
and confessing
.
.
. not taht i
' m at all comparing
" a simple plan
" tothe dostoevsky
. the ending does work
, dispite my protestations
,
but to me
, there was something incessantly nagging adn unsatisfying baout it
;
but if you hadnt no qualms adn were hapyp as a clam with it
,
then jstu ignore me
and go about your day
. bu despite my mere claims
, amke noone misteek thyat i ws completely anbd utterly edge of my seat throughout
, annd even sometimes curdling uv by thge situations taht occured
, nto becuase of any kind ofthe gore factor
( which is
, thankfully for this
, veyr minimal
)
,
but baceause yhe film places its cahracters in situations
and gives them such painful things to overcome thgat i
' ve frankly nto seen much liuke it in quite awhile
. at least nto since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece
.
