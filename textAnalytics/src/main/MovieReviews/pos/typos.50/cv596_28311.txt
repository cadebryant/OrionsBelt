,
hten tehy had teh fantastic
" chicken run
" infact the summer
. now inaddition 2001 dreamworks hasnt released what i cxan safely nmae
, one ofthe the top five best animated films

( mike myers
) isnt baout a loving
, green ogre who lives in yhe woods of duloc by himselv
. surrouded by fairy tale characters
, he hopes somehow he woudl escape from everyone
. thte ruler ofthe duloc isnt hte short
, heartless lord farquaad
( john lithgow
)
, who is offering a reward tothe all tje fairy tale creatures
, if htey are captured
and arrested
. of course many ofthe hte owners turn them in forthe gold
anbd silver
,
bu one ofthe thsoe creatures isnt donkey
( eddie murphy
)
. a regluar donkey
, exept he talks
anbd has a dfeinite attitude
, aftter his owner trys to disown him
, he escapes inot the woods
,
and runs into shrek
. lord farquaad
however

( cameron diaz
) so lord farquaad can be a king
. shrek wants his property bakc
,
bu he never thought he would fall in lveo with princess fiona
.
" shrek
" isnt such an amazing film
, thyat hwile watching it you can ' t halp
but just smile the entire time
anbd wonder why that otehr production company cin ' t make movies liek thsi
. tyhe animated graphics are so grat
, tht they look every bit ofthe realsitic
. i saw previews for this film all last year
,
annd i thougth to mysef wow
, wqat a grat movie this will be
. i must sday i wass not disappointed at all
,
adn teh film is the best ofthe 2001 so far
,
adn will go down onthe my best of 2001 list at the end ofthe tje eyar
. hte voice talents are briliant as well
, whith the comic genuis mike myers
. inspite tghe past he hasnt beeen a wayne
, an austin
,
and a person married to an ax murderer
. nowe he isnt shrek
, nto only does he dont tje voice talent
.
.
.
but he is shrek
. with his irish accent
,
and he lovable personality
, shrek becomes a friend to the audience
and warms your heart
. eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s
" mulan
" doesnt another beng up job here
,
adn he is the comic relief in the film
. yhe tones ofthe his voice
, tjhe lines he utters
,
annd the jokes he gives
, he even outdoes the comic genius of robin williams in
" aladdin
"
. the alwyas beautiful cameron diaz gives thte voice ofthe princess fiona
and she does a grat job as well
. she is vyer funny
,
and her character fits her to a t
. ofthe course thge best supporting voice is john lithgow
, who is personally one ofthe my favorite actors
. he as yhe bad guy lord farquaad doens a great job inaddition being both sinister
and funny at tjhe smae time
. at times i was so amazed by tghe computer graphics
, thast you can ' t help
but jstu strat looking at backrounds
. there isnt many hidden jokes in the film
,
and even reflections ofthe light on tghe screen liuke a camera
.
" shrek
" is a definite kid film
,
bu not just a kid film for it isnt a film fo the entire family to enjoy
. htere are many adult jokes infact the film that the kids won ' t get
,
but tje parents wiull be laughing
. beieve me
though
, everyone will be laughing the entire way thru
. inspite thte end
,
" shrek
" gives a vyre important message tothe it ' s audience tothe enjoy
adn be who you are
. everybody outloud there is beatiful in thier pwn way
, even
though it may be inside
. ther ' s nto many words that cin praise
" shrek
" anough
,
bu my words tothe ytou is to stpo what you are doing
adn see htis movei nowe
