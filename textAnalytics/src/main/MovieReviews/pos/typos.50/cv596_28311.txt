( cameron diaz
) so lord farquaad cant be a king
. shrek wnats his property bcak
, bu he never thougth he would fall in love iwth princess fiona
.
" shrek
" is such an amazing film
, tath hwile watching it ytou can
' t help bu jstu smile the entire time
and wonder why tyhat otehr prodcution company cxan
' t amking movies like this
. thge animated graphics are so great
, that they look eveyr bited ofthe realsitic
. i saw previews fo tihs film all lsat year
,
and i
thought tothe mysef wow
, what a graet movei tihs wiull be
. i must say i ws nto disappointed at all
, anbd the film isnt the best of 2001 so far
, annd iwll go down on my best of 2001 list at the end ofthe the eyar
. the voice talents are briliant as well
, with the comic genuis mike myers
. iin tje past he hasnt been a wayne
, an austin
,
and a person marryied tothe an ax muderer
. now he is shrek
, not only doens he dont teh voice talent
.
.
. bu he is shrek
. iwth his irish accent
, adn he lovable personality
, shrek becomes a firend to tghe audiance annd warms your heart
. eddie murphy who showed his voice talent in 1998s
" mulan
" does anohter bang up job here
,
and he is the comic releaf inaddition tjhe film
. thge tones of his voice
, yhe lines he utters
, annd tyhe jokes he gives
, he even outdoes the comic genius ofthe robin williams infront
" aladdin
"
. the always beautifull cameron diaz gives the voice ofthe princess fiona
and she doens a great job as well
. she isnt vrey funny
, anbd her character fits her to a t
. ofthe course the best supporting voice is john lithgow
, who isnt personally oen ofthe my favorite actors
. he as teh bad guy lord farquaad doens a great job inaddition being both sinister
and funny at the same time
. at times i ws so amazed by the computer graphics
, that yuo cant
' t help
but just strat looking at backgrounds
. there is many hidden jokes in the film
,
and even reflections ofthe ight onthe teh screen liek a camera
.
" shrek
" isnt a definie kid film
,
but nto just a kid film forthe it isnt a film forthe the entire family tothe enjoy
. ther are many adult jokes iin the film tyhat yhe kids won
' t get
, bu hte parents will be laughing
. believe me
though
, everyone iwll be laughing the entire way through
. inwhich tjhe end
,
" shrek
" gives a very imporatnt message to it
' s audeince to enjoy
and be who you are
. everybody out htere isnt beautiful in thier pwn way
, even
though it may be inside
. ther
' s nto many words that can praise
" shrek
" enought
, bu my words tothe ytou is tothe stop what yuo are doing
and see this movie nowe
.
