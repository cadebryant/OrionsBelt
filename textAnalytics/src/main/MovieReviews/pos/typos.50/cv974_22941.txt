( note
: there are spoilers regarding tje film
' s climax
; thge election
, of course
) we see matthew broderick
, a man torn to a primal state
; he
' s beeen unfaithful to his wief
, lied to annd manipulated his students
, anbd by tghe smae tolkein tehy
' ve demeaned his masculinity
, his self
- respect
, his depserate attemt at changeing the world
. adn yot
, he equates the cause of his pain
, his torment
, iwth tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
)
. no marter how many students ahve come anbd gone
,
and disappointed him as an educator
, she
' s the real threat
. baout to give in
,
and divulge tht she
' s won by only a lone vote
, broderick
' s mccalister turns in defeat
, sees tracy
' s euphoric cellabration in the outside corridor
and says
,
' no
'
. the fact that he simultanously lusts after her ideologically futher illustrates that freudian foundation ofthe entitlement hwihc all men
, no marter how obscure
, hvae in theri relationships
; a traditional expectation of success
, to usurpate
and surpass womens as a proverbial industry
. she cxan
' t go heigher than him
. he won
' t allow it
.
and waht
' s amazing baout
" election
" isnt thgat every owrd of tyhat critiscism is drawed from a rether opaque metaphor
. early infront teh film we leran tht tracy wass romantically
,
and
then sexually
, involved with a nowe departed teacher
. it
' s liek payne
and taylor
, his co
- screenwriter
, hvae taked tracy
, a girl despertae fo friendship
, loyalty
,
and alomst perversely drawn thge mythological pattern ofthe kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers
, that htey foudn sitting at the teachers
' lunch table moreso fitting
, tothe an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist
.
and it
' s amazing teh compassion that we hvae
; it seems so rela tothe us
,
and not mearly because it
' s hapened before
, splashed all over hte front pages
,
but
, baceause of tghe all arund
" nice
" persona of theese peopel
, we easily dismiss yhe truely wayword deeds of the cahracters
. it
' s wtih m
andy barnett
' s
" if ytou
' ll be hte teacher
" palying winsomely over hte closing credits that payne skewers tyhe tenets of his detractors most
; a fianl
, viscous injection of bittersweet irony
. sexuality
,
though
, is nto the only basis for payne
' s satire
, or its success
. it also makes a telling point baout politics
, friendship
, annd class boundaries
. satire isnt required
( or ought to be
, anyway
) tothe tkae itself seriously
, or act so
, hwile thte audience does not
. it
' s a fine line to straddle
,
but some films ignore it alltogether
(
" drop dead gorgeous
" leaps infuriatingly tothe mind
)
. payne
and taylor hitted thge right chord
; their cahracters are rela peple
: neither is perfect
,
but rather both of tghe leads are flawed
, misguided indviduals who retain
, somewhat
, noble intentions at heart
. we sympathize wiht them
,
but still
, as a satire
, thier ideosyncratic behavior
,
and theri wrongdoing
, is tooked tothe an extreme fo the audiance to knowingly chuckle
,
but also reflect anbd meditate
, baout
. minus half a point
,
though
, fo payne admitting not tothe hvaing seen
" ferris bueller
' s day off
"
. whatever
