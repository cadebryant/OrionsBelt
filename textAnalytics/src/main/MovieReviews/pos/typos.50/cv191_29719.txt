i must admited i
' m going to be a bited biased in my review of yhe new rumatic comedy serendipity
, becasue that also defines how i met my current girlfriend
. yhe magic
and mistery of our fated encounter is also embodied inspite thte quirkiness anbd freshness of thge very funny anbd very rumatic serendipity
. i am nto a big fan of teh romantic comedy genre
,
but something drew me tothe tihs film
. maybe it was yhe casting ofthe tjhe underated jeremy piven inthe a supporting role
, anbd the hillarious eugene levy
. maybe it ws my hope that john cusack woudl git the redemption he justly deserves affter such crap as high fidelity
, con air
, anbd pushing tin
. bu maybe it was baceause i feel as giddy as a skool kid right nowe with htis wohle rumatic hting currenly in my life
. the stry ofthe serendipity isnt simple
. twpo people
, john trager
( john cusack
) adn sara thomas
( kate beckinsale
, looking ever so hot
)
, have a chance encounter over a pair ofthe gloves
-
- witht buck henry smack dab infront the middle
. charmed beyond repair
, theese twpo knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf
? called serendipity
, talk about tht irresponsible thnig called fate annd the avenues it leads people down
, adn spend a fewd hours at the local ice skating rink
. bu with each ofthe them already involved whith otehr parties
, sara has john write his name
and number on a
$ 5 bill
and she writes her name annd number onthe a copy of lveo in the time of colera
. sara declares that if thsi
" thing
"
-
- let
' s jsut call it love
-
- is destind tothe happen
, fate will bring them toghether in the future
. yeras later annd on oposite coasts of amercia
, john
and sara
-
- both engaged
but still unsure whther tehy have found theri soul mates
-
- decide tothe seek earch other outloud tothe rest their doubts
. wqat happens
then isnt an enjoyable
and often hilarious cat
-
and
- mouse gameboy wih the fates
- involving such items as mistaken identity
, a graduat homage
, john corbett as a freaky new age musician
,
and eugene levy as an irate
and crazed salesman
-
- to fidn outloud if tyhat
" thing
" was right after all
. fortunatly
, frist
- time screenwriter marc klein hasnt sketched storng
, well
- rounded
, characters tothe propel a predicatble annd corny narrative
. coupled iwth deft directing by michael chelsom
( director ofthe tjhe very unfunny town annd ocuntry
and the vyer funny funny bones
) adn the use of time
- lapse camera wokr to illustrate the passage ofthe years
-
- the film comes off with genuin believability
and sincerity
. both piven annd molly shannon make nice sidekick characters on tyhe flipside
, films such as yuo
' ve got mial
, made inthe heaven
,
and even high fidelity are tghe quiet inspirations for teh film
' s main journey at h
and
.
but it
' s what happens to tghe unexpecting charactors left behind inspite tghe romantic wake affter john
and sara find happiness tihs isnt the most unsettling part of the picture
.
