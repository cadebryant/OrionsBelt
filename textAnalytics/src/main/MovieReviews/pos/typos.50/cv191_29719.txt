i must admit i ' m oging tothe be a bited biased infront my review of the new rumatic comedy serendipity
, becouse taht aslo defines how i met my currrent girlfriend
. hte magic
anbd mystery of our fated encounter is allso embodied inaddition tjhe quirkiness
adn freshness ofthe teh vyer funny
anbd vyre romantic serendipity
. i am not a big fan of the rumatic comedy genre
,
but something drew me to this film
. mabye it wass tyhe casting of tyhe underrated jeremy piven infact a supporting role
,
and the hillarious eugene levy
. maybe it wass my hope thgat john cusack owudl git tyhe redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity
, con air
,
annd pushing tin
.
bu maybe it ws beacuse i fiel as giddy as a school kid right nowe with this whole romantic thing currenly in my life
. the story of serendipity isnt simple
. two people
, john trager
( john cusack
)
and sara thomas
( kate beckinsale
, looking ever so hot
)
, hvae a chance encounter over a pair of gloves
-
- withthe buck henry smack dab in hte middle
. charmed beyond repair
, these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf
? called serendipity
, talk about tyhat irresponsible thing called fate
anbd hte avenues it leads peple down
,
and spend a few hours at the local ice skateing rink
.
bu with each ofthe them laready involved with otehr parties
, sara has john write his nmae
annd number on a
$ 5 bill
anbd she writes her name
and number on a copy of lvoe in the time of colera
. sara declares that if this
" thnig
"
-
- let ' s jsut call it love
-
- is detsined to happen
, fate will bring them together iin thte future
. years later
and on opposite coasts of amercia
, john
and sara
-
- both engaged
but still unsure whther they hvea found theri soul mates
-
- decide tothe seek earch other outloud tothe rest theri doubts
. what happens
then is an enjoyable
annd oftenly hillarious cat
-
and
- mouse game with the fates
- involving such items as mistaken idenity
, a graduate homage
, john corbett as a freaky new age muscician
,
and eugene levy as an irate
and crazed salesman
-
- to find out if thta
" thnig
" ws right aftter all
. fortunately
, frist
- time screenwrighter marc klein hasnt sketched storng
, well
- rounded
, cahracters tothe propell a predictable
annd corny narrative
. coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom
( directer of hte vrey unfunny twon
anbd country
adn the very funny funny bones
)
and thge uise of time
- lapse camera wokr to illustrate tjhe passage ofthe eyasr
-
- tje film comes off wtih genuin believability
adn sincerity
. both piven
annd molly shannon make nice sidekick charachters onthe the flipside
, films such as you ' ve got mial
, made in heaven
,
and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film ' s main journy at hand
.
but it ' s wqat happens to tyhe unexpecting cahracters left behind inspite tjhe romantic wake aftter john
adn sara fidn happiness tihs isnt tje most unsettling part ofthe hte picture
.
