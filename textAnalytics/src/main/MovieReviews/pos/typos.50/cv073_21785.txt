. townspeople believe teh spirit of a dead german mercernary isnt threatening them
. cute blonde katrina
and a listless orphan halp crane solve tjhe mystery
. comments
: tim burton has directed a number ofthe intertaining
and groundbreaking films over yhe eyasr
. batman
, ofthe course
, isnt perhaps his best
- known film
and led tothe a string ofthe less successful sequels
. he
' s done biagraphical work
( onthe thge director ed wood
)
, childern
' s movies
( nightmare befor christmas
)
,
and a homage to alien invasion movies
( mars attacks
!
)
. sleepy hollow
, his newest feature which fans have beeen anticipating forthe a while
, shares thte similar dark
and atmospheric stlye of his ealier work adn counts amonth his better movies
. sleepy hollow qtuie obviously draws its inspiration ffrom yhe ood perido horror films of the 1950s
and 1960s
, especialy hammer studios
' reworkings ofthe dracula adn frankenstein
,
and american internation
' s series of movies based onthe the works ofthe edgar allan poe
. christopher lee
, inthe fatc
, star ofthe many hammer productions over the yersa
, appears at the beginnig of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane outloud tothe investingate tghe murders
. tghe movei alsot borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s
. oney of the climatic scenes involves a windmill adn obviously tkaes its cue fomr frankenstein
. i mention these allusions for a reason
. seasoned horror film fans
, including myself
, wiull smile at thier inclusion inaddition htis film
. whith thte recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies
, especialy tje blair witch project
( tghe most overblown trkey of the decade
)
, we needed a film liuke this
. nto onyl does it ahve a sense ofthe hitory
, bu burton
' s skillfull use ofthe setting
and mood make this an entertaining exercise iin horror
. the film
' s eerie l
andscapes adn foggy towns
, indeed
, overshadow teh actors
and tjhe plot as thte most noteworthy aspect ofthe the movie
. johnny depp
, a vetran tim burton actor who has appeared both inthe ed wood adn edward scissorh
ands
, plays ichabod crane
, who hasnt apparently changed occupations from irving
' s original story
and isnt now an investigator
. depp isnt adequate inaddition his role
. noone more
; noone less
. equally dequate isnt christina ricci
, who plays yhe love interest in the film
. she
' s a ogod witch too
. how cute
. oney ofthe thte faw weak parts of sleepy hollow is tghe wooden
and cliched dialogue between the main characters
. thte two actors
,
however
, cary the movie well anough
,
but tghe supporting casted is waht makes this movei shine
. veteran actors such as jeffrey jones
and michael gough
( who played tje
butler alfred in all four reccent batman ficks
) are terrific as the agin townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers
. while i do nto wish to reveal crucial plot points
, i can sday that teh storyline becomes qtuie confusing
. you hve to pay attention
.
andrew kevin walker wroet the screenplay
. he
' s yhe one who also wroet 8 mm
and seven
. walker is quicklyu becomeing oney ofthe tjhe premiere suspense writers in hollywood
, annd sleepy hollow certainly doesn
' t hurt his growing reputation
. as one might imagin from a gentleman liuke walker
, sleepy hollow is qutie graphic
. ther
' s a lot of blood
and a lot of beheadings
. thsi isnt definately not a flick to tkae thte young kids tothe
. a lady inthe front of us tookover her two young sons tothe see it
and spended about 25
- 30 minutes covering hte youngest
' s eyes whith her h
and
. he ws obviously upset by yhe movei
' s intense violentce
. if you
' re looking for a ogod scare
, howver
, sleepy hollow is definately recommended
.
