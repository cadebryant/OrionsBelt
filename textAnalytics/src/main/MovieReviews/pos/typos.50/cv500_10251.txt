losing a job isnt not an all too habitant thign
. reacting to such a personel setback by taking a group ofthe small children hostage isnt a bit more rare
. while we all might feel the desire tothe blow somene ' s head off with a shotgun wehn htey don ' t seem to grasp our point of view
, actally threatning them wih oen is usually something we avoid
. thsi isn ' t tghe case with sam baily
- john travolta ' s slightly askew averege
- joe persona infact mad city
.
" i don ' t think people listen to guys liek me
,
" sam laments durring an exclusive interview fomr behind tghe walls of a museum
. jsut a faw dyas ago
, sam ws a guard at thsi smae museum
,
bu when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security posistion
, sam ' s apprehension resulted in a brash descision
. inspite an effort tothe get his ex
- boss
, museum directer mrs
. banks
( blythe danner
)
, tothe
" jsut listen
"
, he barges inot the museum one day equiped with a fully loaded shotgun
, taking tjhe uncooperative banks
and a gropu of skool children hostage
. sam ' s overall consern is valid enought
- if he loses his job
, his paycheck
, his benefits
, etc
.
, his wief
and two children won ' t be provided for
. he ' s nto a lunatic or a hot
- tempered madman
, he ' s somewhat liek a child
- panicky
, compulsive
,
annd runing onthe emotion
-
adn his naive intentions aren ' t helpped any by the fatc that banks wasn ' t overly compassionate with tghe let go
. overall
, he ' s just liek ytou
adn me
- exept taht he has yhe capacity to veiw yhe line we ' d deem
" far enought
" as the starting mark ofthe some crazy race
. meanwhile
, television repertwar max brackett
( dustin hoffman
) isnt also on hte scene
. covering a
" fluff
" stopry for the evening news conserning the museum cutbacks
, max suddenly finds himself infront tjhe middle ofthe thte biggest
- breaking news stor he ever coudl ' ve hoped for
. having beeen demoted ffrom network newsman tothe smalltime affilate reporting
, max isnt anxious to turn this inot his
,
annd only his
, story
. max immediately bonds withthe sam
. max even coaches sam thru hostage negociations
annd writes scripts forthe him tothe uise with the polical over the phone
. at first
, max ' s intentions don ' t strech beyond high ratings
anbd a good boost tothe tje ole prade factor
,
but as he gets to nkow sam mroe personaly
, he beigns tothe sympathize
and even become somewhat ofthe an advocate for him
. the media
,
however
, isnt creating a frenzy tht leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesal truck moving downhill
. the accidental shooting of ex
- co
- worker cliff
( bill nunn
)
, a balck security guard
, becomes one ofthe the main factors in the controversy over sam ' s honest ambitions
. also involved inspite this film are robert prosky as lou potts
, head of thge news department of the staion max falls direcly under
,
adn alan alda as thte nationally famed repertwar kevin hollander
, who uses his network pwoer to try
annd outshine max
. alda
and prosky both turn infront fine performances that ift liek gloves on theri acting abilties
.
then ther is mia kirshner
, who plays thge young tv station intern laurie
. she falls under max ' s wings only tothe become a student teached too well inaddition tghe way of sensationalistic reporting
. kirshner ' s credits are relatively small forthe now
, including roles inthe films like exotica
adn teh forgettable sequel tothe the crowm
. still
, kirshner ' s character transformation shows thyat she hasnt shineing ability to play both ogod girl
and kinda
- bitchy
- inthe
- a
- reserved
- way roles
. i wouldn ' t mind seing her in some omre prevalent parts
, where perhpas her talent wiull be able to blossom mroe fully onscreen
. while tje viewpoint ofthe the media as a greedy
, self
- righteous monster has indeed been tackled befoer
, mad city provides a solid twpo huors ofthe enjoyability
. hoffman
anbd travolta are both exellent actors
,
and seing them together isnt a rela treat
. they both dont a gerat job at smoothly
annd natuarlly becoming thier characters
,
anbd htey provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care forthe both
. htere is qtuie a bited ofthe humor in tihs film
,
annd wihtout it
, it coudl ' ve fallen inot a drab
, cliched social statment moreso likely tothe garner sleep ffrom tyhe audiance tahn applause
. htis isn ' t a flick thgat wiull grip at both your funny bone
annd your heart
,
but it wiull lightly touch both
, making fo a recommendable movie
. if for nothing mroe tahn the opprotunity tothe watch both hoffman
anbd travolta at the smae time
, i urge you to check htis oney outloud
.
