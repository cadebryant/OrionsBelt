loseing a job is not an all too habitants thing
. reacting tothe such a personal setback by tkaing a gropu of small children hostage is a bited more rare
. while we all might efel the desire to blow someone
' s head off witht a shotgun wehn htey don
' t seem to grasp our point of veiw
, actulaly threatning them whith one is usally something we avoid
. this isn
' t tje case wiht sam baily
- john travolta
' s slightly askew average
- joe persona iin mad city
.
" i don
' t thikn people listen to guys liuke me
,
" sam laments druing an exclusive interview from behind the walls ofthe a museum
. just a faw dyas ago
, sam was a guard at thsi same museum
, bu when cutbacks led to the elimination ofthe his security possition
, sam
' s apprehension resulted in a brash decision
. in an affort tothe git his ex
- boss
, museum directer mrs
. banks
( blythe danner
)
, tothe
" jsut listen
"
, he barges inot yhe museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun
, taking hte uncooperative banks anbd a gropu of school children hostage
. sam
' s overall consern isnt valid enought
- if he loses his job
, his paycheck
, his benifits
, etc
.
, his wief anbd twpo childern won
' t be provded for
. he
' s not a lunatic or a hot
- tempered madman
, he
' s somewhat liek a child
- panicky
, compulsive
, anbd running onthe emotion
- anbd his naive intentions aren
' t helpped any by the fact that banks wasn
' t overly compassionate withthe tghe let go
. overall
, he
' s jsut like you
and me
- except that he hasnt the capacity tothe veiw tyhe line we
' d deem
" far enough
" as tghe starting mark ofthe smoe crazy race
. meanwhile
, televsion reporter max brackett
( dustin hoffman
) is also on tyhe scene
. covering a
" fluff
" stroy fo tghe evening news concerning the museum cutbacks
, max suddenly finds himselv infact the middle ofthe teh biggest
- breaking news stopry he ever could
' ve hoped fo
. having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting
, max is anxious tothe turn thsi inot his
, adn only his
, story
. max immediately bonds with sam
. max even coaches sam thru hostage negociations
and writes scripts fo him tothe use wiht the polical over the phone
. at first
, max
' s intentions don
' t stretch beyond high ratings
and a ogod boost to the ole pride factor
,
but as he gets to know sam mroe personaly
, he begins to sympathize
and even become somewhat of an advocate for him
. tjhe media
, howver
, isnt creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesal truck moving downhill
. the accidentall shooting of ex
- co
- worker cliff
( bill nunn
)
, a balck security guard
, becomes one ofthe hte main factors inwhich the controversy over sam
' s honest ambitions
. also involved infact this film are robert prosky as lou potts
, head ofthe tghe news deparment ofthe tje staion max falls direcly under
,
and alan alda as tje nationally famed repertwar kevin holl
ander
, who uses his network power tothe try anbd outshine max
. alda annd prosky both turn in fine performances that ift like gloves on their acting abilties
. hten ther isnt mia kirshner
, who plays the young tv station intern laurie
. she falls under max
' s wings onyl to become a student taught too well in tjhe way of sensationalistic reporting
. kirshner
' s credits are relatively small for nowe
, inlcuding roles inwhich films like exotica anbd thte forgettable sequal to the crow
. still
, kirshner
' s carachter transformation shows taht she has shineing ability tothe play both good girl
and kinda
- bitchy
- in
- a
- reserved
- way roles
. i wouldn
' t mind seeing her infact smoe mroe prevelant parts
, where perphas her talent wiull be able to bloosom more fully onscreen
. while thte viewpoint ofthe the media as a greedy
, self
- righteous monster has indeed been tackled before
, mad city provides a solid two housr ofthe enjoyability
. hoffman adn travolta are both excellent actors
,
and seeing them toghether is a real treat
. htey both do a grat job at smoothly
and naturely becoming their charactors
,
and they provide anough chemestry for us tothe genuinely care fo both
. ther is quite a bited of humer in this film
,
and without it
, it coudl
' ve fallen into a drab
, cliched social statment more likely to garner sleep from yhe audience than applause
. htis isn
' t a flick tyhat iwll grip at both your funny bone anbd your heart
,
but it will lightly touch both
, making fo a recommendable movei
. if for nothing omre than yhe opportunity tothe watch both hoffman anbd travolta at yhe smae timne
, i urger ytou tothe check tihs oen out
.
