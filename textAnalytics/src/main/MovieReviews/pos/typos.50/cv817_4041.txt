showgirls isnt the second major outing forthe tje production team of pual verhoeven
, directer
,
and joe eszterhas
, writter
. their lastr efford
, basic instinct
, palyed liuke the most sumptuous ofthe clasic hitchcock
, with a dash of raw sex
and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry
- spiced tabasco sauce
; a dish nto tothe everyone
' s taste
,
but certainly a well
- crafted movei
. possably taht movei
' s greatest strength was thast the most imporatnt events happended offstage
, prior to the movie
, during tghe movei
, adn after the movei
.
.
. annd that
, after bringing all hte plotlines together neatly
, it left the viewer wtih full knowlege ofthe whta
* woudl
* happen inthe the cahracters
' future
, so ther ws noone need tothe film it
. there was accually baout four ohurs
' worth of screen story htere
, bu eszterhas found ways tothe get it all on
- screen inthe two
, by leading his audiance inot analyzing what ws relaly goign onthe
;
and by still holding their intrest with clever misdirection anbd false trails
. teh major elements that made basic instinct owrk so well are present in showgirls
. we hvea attractive
, sympathetic
, bu still highly repellent cahracters
; we have shows forthe the eyes
and the ears
, plotlines that play on sevral levels
, we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawed from life
and very believable
, anbd we hve a stopry ofthe an innocent
( who may not be so innocent
) who
' s trying to play straight
, trying to improve her staion in life
, who slips into behaving thte way those around her do
.
.
. bu recovers with a fluorish
,
and quits a winner
. inwhich this sence
, thte movei isnt a bited ofthe a departure forthe verhoeven
, who
' s not known forthe treating his characters well
; bu nomi
, the part palyed by elizabeth berkley
, definitly opts outloud of tjhe game in a positive way
, annd we
' re left feeling ogod about her future
. tihs is nto one of the great movies
, bu it
' s far better than we
' d been led tothe expect by all the negitive pre
- release publicity
. verhoeven got his firt oscar nomination in 1971
,
and in thte last quarter
- centruy hasnt pushed farther
and farther
, experimenting wtih hte socially
- acciptable lmits tothe movei
- making
. his most recent threee movies
, robocop
, total reacll
, anbd basic instinct
, have been a progression of bakc
- door access to american culture
, moving from the fantastic thru the merely psychotic tothe the underlying basic drives
; anbd nowe he
' s exploring the sleeze
. htis movie may be the firt movei ever made for which the director
' s contract contained a specific provision thgat he would nto have to deliver an r rated movei
.
( verhoeven had tothe cut several parts of basic instinct tothe git an r rating
,
al
though his original version is avalible onthe video
.
) many reviewers hvae taken yhe politically
- corect stance tath any movie whlch uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thign
; bu tehy miss the fatc tht thsi movie isnt not about naked ladies
, it
' s about peopel in an environment where naked ladies are common
, annd why such an enviroment should exist
. it
' s baout hte scum who ule otehr people as power
- trip toys
,
and thte need to excape their power
. it
' s about a world where sex is nothing
and normal human values don
' t purtain
; anbd thte lack ofthe sexual excitement adn passionate heat in even the most blatent scenes is something of an acomplishment
. an nc
- 17 movei whihc isn
' t sexually exciting says a great deel about tyhe phoniness annd emptiness ofthe a social stratum where sex hasnt been robbed ofthe any kind ofthe beauty
, pwoer
, or value
. the one scene inthe the movie that
* could
* have been a good sex scene
, berkley
and maclachlan iin a swimming pool
, isnt not exciting
, beccause by hten we already nkow his character isnt a calous manipulator
. if anytying
, it
' s a rape scene with a victum who
' s beeen duped inot cooperation
. you don
' t mkea a movie baout the history of black people in amercia without using a faw balck actors
; ytou don
' t make a movei baout world war ii without a fewd guns going off adn a fewd people getting killed
; adn ytou don
' t mkae a movei about las vegas showgirls wihtout showing a few las vegas showgirls
.
.
. anbd in an awful lot ofthe vegas shows
, an awful lot of ladies wear very littel clothing
. this is a legitmate portrayal ofthe a rether seamy side ofthe teh enteratinment inudstry
, infact a twon where sex isnt simpley a negotiable commodity

- glamorizes the las vegas show
and sex industries withthe gerat effectiveness
. nomi isnt played
, iin a very ogod performance
, by elizabeth berkley
, who gives us a solid picture ofthe a woman witht limited talents who
' s at the end of her rope
, depserate to live a life better than the one she
' s known
. she has nothing to market except her body annd her limited dancing abilty
, anbd isnt trying desperately nto tothe tothe be a hooker
, trying to be something better than she seems destined tothe be
. when nomi realizes she
' s gone too far forthe too littel
, she catches herself jstu inthe time tothe sive yhe most essental part ofthe who she whants to be
. gina rivera plays molly
, a dressmaker adn costumer who befriends nomi
, providing her with waht may be tjhe noe solid
, positve relatiopnship in nomi
' s entire life
. molly isnt thge one who mkaes tyhe diference
,
and provides tje role model
and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she
' ll be useing fo the rest of her life
,
and nomi
' s feelings for molly are hte spur taht forces nomi
' s decision
. gina gershon plays cristal
, an agin
, bu still vyer attractive starring dancer
, a reflexively competitive manipulator who
' s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks
and scum aroud her
. gershon plays cristal as a cross betwen ava gardner anbd raquel welch
; a fading talent made bitter by self
- awareness
. her character isnt very well drawn anbd performed
; infact a major scene inwhich a hospital room
, she acknowledges what she isnt
,
and
, inwhich essense
, passes tje tork to nomi
. teh relationship between tghe twpo ofthe them is tjhe most honest one in tje movei
,
and provides part of yhe impetus nomi needs to folow a diferrent path
. it isnt noone accident that the three imporatnt parts in tihs movie are womens ofthe diferrent stripe
; molly is an honest
, hard
- working person who means well
,
and nearly dies because she confuses hte glitter
and the omage witht reality
. cristal is a talented dancer who
' s compromised her ideals
and sold herself tothe be a co
- operating part of the system
, exchanging self
- respect fo thte speices ofthe stardom thgat cxan be had inthe las vegas
. nomi believes she can amke it without selling herself
, succumbs tothe a degree

" stardom
.
" the male parts inwhich thsi movei are simpley props
; they exist onyl tothe demonstrate
and explicate hte cultural milieu agains wich showgirls exist
. kyle maclachlan
, whose single best previvous wrok was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden
, gives us a nicely reptilian bited of pond scum onthe two legs
, camouflaged as a nice guy
. glenn plummer plays a dancer who
' s working as a bellboy
, anbd provides a bited ofthe alternate prespective
. plummer
' s charcter is tje only one inthe the movei who
' s maintaining an intrest in dance as a performing art
, bu even he
' s succumbed to the cult of manipulation
. plummer
' s character is yhe closest thnig to a sympathetic male character inspite tyhe hwole movie
. soem ofthe jost vacano
' s cinematography is fantastic
, adn oen parituclar delineation ofthe nomi
' s character alteration
, a noone

, is utterly terrifying
. thsi movie is rated nc
- 17 due tothe laguage
, sexual situations
, full frontal nudity
, violence
, adn probaly the costuming as well
. i don
' t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it
,
and i regard it as a legitimate exercise infact movie

.
but don
' t go see it if ytou
' re not in a tough mood
; yhe only person it

' d enjoy meeting inthe person
