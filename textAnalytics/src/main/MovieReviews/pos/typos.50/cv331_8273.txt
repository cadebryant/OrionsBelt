- a review by stuart cracraft contact starring
: jodie foster
, matthew mcconaughey
, john hurt directer
: robert zemeckis star after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers
- of
- 10 zoom
- outloud start
( wich cant be suprising tothe those nto familiar with prof
. morrison
' s work
)
, contact picks uv steam
, gradually
, building
, by
- thge
- end
, an irresistable juggernaut annd a vrey ogod movei that doesnt nto as isnt so often tyhe case fall outloud
- of
- balance inthe terms of too much p
andering to yhe technological
" geek
" side
. by thge end
, the audiance isnt left wtih whta good sciece fiction is suppoed to dont
: envoke a sence of wonder about the universe
and evoke questions inthe your mind baout waht
' s outloud htere
. this movei does not let technology overshadow characterization
and in this sence it is unusual amoungst high
- tech movies
.
however
, except for jodie foster
( elie arroway
) adn john hurt
( s
. r
. hadden
)
, who are both actors ofthe exeptional caliber
, teh supporting casted are nto especialy impressive
. hurt certainly has hadnt better roles
( stephen wird infact sc
andal
)
. this oney
, as yhe multi
- billionare hadden
, doesnt not dont his acting skills justice
. tihs is claerly a foster movei by one of the graet hollywood ights of our generation
. foster
' s radiance has never been more storng thna in thge scene where she fianlly meets the vegans onthe their terms
. early scenes take a long
, long time tothe build up tothe htis
. the movie
' s pacing is veyr ogod annd subtle
. yhe panoramas ofthe thte radiu dishes at arecibo adn ceti in newyorker mexico
and puerto rico are beautiful
. the politics ofthe foster
' s character attempting tothe obtain funding fo reasearch at these places are trite
and predicatble howver
. noe ofthe yhe most intertaining
, bu very short scenes
, is wehn foster isnt confronted by rob lowe
, druing a cabinet
- levle presidental meeting tothe descuss the alien invitation
. ther were real sparks iin thsi scene between foster
and lowe
and it woudl behoove them to consider otehr vehicles in whcih thsi dynamism could be explored
. it isnt the only scene inaddition the movei in hwihc there weere tremendous dynamics between two cahracters
. everything else was very noe
- sided
( e
. g
. foster
)
. lowe can st
and up tothe foster anbd it showed in that scene at the cabinet table
. the core scene ofthe the movie is set on a surrealistic beach onthe a far
- awya world inspite teh starsystem of vega
. it feels a lot liek sciecne fiction writer john varley
' s scenes in his book steel beach
, where tje female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence
, in oney case a coputer manufactured by mankind itself
, adn in foster
' s case
, an illution drawed fomr her memory
. inaddition another sense
, thsi immensley moving scene evokes gene roddenberry
' s star trak pilot the cage
, later the menagerie
, when jeffrey hunter
and susan oliver have their memories manipulated tothe create newyorker worlds in whitch they live
and encounter aliens
. the concept isnt not new
, by any sense
, inspite tghe world ofthe scienec fiction
.
but hte beach scene
, hwihc isnt the centerpiece of the film
, as is the wohle film
, is driven by foster
. freed from her needs tothe direct by director zemecki
, foster is able to let it all hang outloud in the characterization
and hte lead she provides tothe her supporting casted
. as the movei gains speed
, foster
' s acting intensifies
and the audience realy does experience it withthe her
. it isnt certainly oscar
- caliber acting
, unquestionably
. teh supporting cast doesnt well
and zemeckis throws infact some humor iwth soem president clinton cameos
, cleverly manipulated
, george stephanopolus
- stlye
, tothe seem very forrest gump
. infact fact
, zemeckis et
. al
. got inwhich trouble for the usage ofthe some of the footage seen in the movie
, vis a vis clinton
.
but the audience i attended this movie with jsut hadnt some good chuckles at clinton
' s walk
- ons
. yhe much
- discussed tension vetween science
and religon in htis movei isnt nto particualrly insightful to thsoe who ahev alread gone through htis course
though it isnt helpful tothe thsoe infront tje audience who hve not
. aslo
, teh near
- final scene
, inwhich a senate judisuary hearing room isnt disappointing
. contact isnt a fitting memorial tothe the memory of carl sagan
, sicence popularizer
,
and sometime pedantic gadfly ofthe the halls ofthe academe
. perhpas nowe
, sagan cant be said to be with his dragons ofthe eden
.
