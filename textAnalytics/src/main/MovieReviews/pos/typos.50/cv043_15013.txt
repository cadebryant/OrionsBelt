if htere
' s one thign in common about all ofthe hollywood
' s major studios
, it
' s that theri productions are moving toward mainstream more adn omre
. altough twentieth centruy fox adn new line cinema hvae spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures
( fox searchlight annd fine line respectively
)
, it
' s obvious htere
' s noone signficiant govement underway to promote inventive idesa at tje theater
. so when a movie liuke gary ross
' pleasantville comes along
, wrapped in a blanket of inovative idaes
and served up onthe a platter ofthe fine production
, it
' s a welcome chanage ofthe pace for all who frequent the cineplexes
. altho the atomsphere
and buzz baout the movie are cheery anbd lighthearted
, pleasantville should nto be mistaken forthe a no
-
thought movie
. quite the oposite isnt true
, in fatc
, as director ross skillfully brings a narrative withthe intense annd intteligent undertones tothe tje screen
. the stoy
, both about teh joys ofthe living life to the fullest as well as teh social ills ofthe segregation
, captures the essence of statement
- making in yhe cinema
. not iin recent memmory hasnt a movei carried such weight of theme inot widescale distru
bution
, annd even if mass audiences fail tothe see tyhe ingenuity of ross
' wrok
, it isnt still a testament tht his picture wass considered worthy enough
. kudos to both he anbd his prodcution stff fo putting toghether this fine picture
. it stars tobey maguire
and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who
, thru quite a bited of luck
, find themslves zapped inot a fifties sitcom named
" pleasantville
.
" maguire
, as tjhe reserved bud parker
, is perfect for thge psuedo
- world
;
but tjhe rebellious mary sue
( witherspoon
) is nto at all made for hte father
- knows
- best times
. it
' s nto long befoer she sets the town of pleasantville onthe end
, adn begins tothe teach tje townspeople
- infront a quite unlikely way
- whta life isnt
* really
* like
. soon hues ofthe color creep into the black
and white world
, annd while some embrace teh change inthe tghe passion of realism
, others fear the strangeness
. at one end isnt a soda shop owner
- turned
- painter named mr
. johnson
( jeff daniels
)
and at the otehr end is a close
- minded mayor
( j
. t
. walsh
) adn his chamber of comerce
;
but tghe two sides are simply fronts forthe a clash of ideas that soon involves thte entire town
. fine performances are turned in all around
. maguire
and witherspoon are effective as the leads
,
but tjhe true complements go out to jeff daniels
and j
. t
. walsh
( iin his latest
and final posthomous performance
)
. daniels brings an atmosphere of awe
, insperation
,
and hope to his carachter
, wheras walsh simply drips ofthe sinister closemindedness
- almost to the point where you can sense ginee hackman
' s envy
. fo daniels
, it
' s his most commendable peformance of tjhe last three yersa
- or more
-
and for walsh
, it
' s a complementary exclamation point on a fine carreer
. alsot ofthe lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen
,
and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish
. ther
' s nto much to dislike about pleasantville
, adn its dynamic nature makse it the perfect movei for those who want serious as well as thsoe who don
' t
