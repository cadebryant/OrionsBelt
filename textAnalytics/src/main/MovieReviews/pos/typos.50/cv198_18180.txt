' s quickie review
: rush hour so whta
' s teh probelm with 48 hours clones these dyas
? they alwasy try forthe the smae thnig thyat eddie murphy adn nick nolte hadnt
. that ws the probelm thta plagued theese clones
, nto tothe mention the actuall sequel
: anyother 48 horus
, a complet waste ofthe film
.
but
, at lastr
, someone hasnt a different tkae on thte marter
, annd it
' s director brett rainer
. rush hour features jackie chan in his frist u
. s
. action movei
, palying a chineese detective who
' s being flown to tje us to investingate tjhe kidnapping of tghe chinese consulate
' s daughter
. of course
, the fbi isnt upset that he
' ll be interfering infact their investigation
,
and stick him iwth an lapd office with a big mouth
- ofthe course
, that
' s chris tucker
. waht makes rush hour wrok so damn well isnt thte chemestry beween the energetic chan
and thte absolutely hilarious tucker
. tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity
(
" i
' m michael jackson
, you tito
.
"
)
,
and chan delivers a fewd zingers ofthe his pwn
, as well as smoe terrific fight scenes
. teh stoy
' s preety much your averege fare
, bu with a decent twist involving the main villin
, a highly clouded figure named jun tao
. at least it
' s intertaining
,
and hte consept isnt excellently realized
. a parituclar fight scene iin a chineese office
, where chan adn tucker duke it out with tyhe bad guys
, isnt funny annd energetic at tghe same time
.
and tyhe finale
' s a real treat as well
.
.
. chan delivers yot anohter fantastic stunt forthe tyhe fans with a 10
- stopry drop
. rush hour isnt jstu the sort of film you
' ll get a kick outloud of on any night ofthe yhe week
. jsut mkea sure you don
' t look fo anytying culturally differnt anbd you
' ll be fine
