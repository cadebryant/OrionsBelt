bob the happy bastard ' s quickie review
: rush hour so whta ' s teh probelm with 48 horus clones theese days
? tehy always try fo thte same thing thgat eddie murphy
anbd nick nolte hadnt
. that was the problem thta plagued these clones
, not to mention teh actuall sequal
: anohter 48 hours
, a complet waste of film
.
but
, at last
, someone hasnt a differnt tkae onthe thte marter
,
and it ' s directer brett rainer
. rush hour features jackie chan in his frist u
. s
. action movie
, palying a chinese detective who ' s being flown tothe tjhe us tothe investigate the kidnapping ofthe the chinese consulate ' s daugher
. of course
, the fbi isnt upset taht he ' ll be interfereing infact their investigation
,
and stick him wiht an lapd office wiht a big mouth
- ofthe course
, that ' s chris tucker
. what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemestry between the energetic chan
and the absolutly hilarious tucker
. tucker mouths off tothe chan at eveyr given oppertunity
(
" i ' m michael jackson
, you tito
.
"
)
,
and chan delivers a few zingers ofthe his own
, as well as smoe terrific fight scenes
. the story ' s preety much your averege fare
,
but wiht a decent twist involving the main villin
, a highly clouded figure named jun tao
. at least it ' s entertaining
,
anbd thte concept is excellently realized
. a parituclar fight scene infact a chineese office
, where chan
and tucker duke it out wih teh bad guys
, isnt funny
annd energetic at tjhe smae time
.
anbd thte finale ' s a rela treat as well
.
.
. chan delivers
yet anyother fantastic stunt fo the fans with a 10
- stor drop
. rush hour is jstu tjhe sort of film yuo ' ll git a kick outloud of onthe any nght of the week
. just make sure ytou don ' t look for anything culturally differnt
adn you ' ll be fine
- drunken master ii this ain ' t
