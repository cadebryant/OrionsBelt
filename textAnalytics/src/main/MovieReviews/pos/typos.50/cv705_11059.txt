.
but whn potter learns of the tiny people

) to kill off the clan
. there ' s plenty ofthe attention tothe detail in the borrowers
, expecially in yhe furnishings of the clock family house
, made outloud of lost board game parts
annd credit cards
. yhe background details are nearly as rich as tyhe intertaining story
. tghe varous predicaments of the clock familiy are clever
anbd thrilling
. based on an original story
, the screenwriters doed a good job at imagining all tghe potential
adn unusual perils that sould exist forthe a 4
- inch tall person
. as the villain
, john goodman ' s performence veers onthe the edge of bieng over
- the
- top
.
but his performence suits yhe role well
,
and he does veyr well in the film ' s many slapstick moments
. with a nearly seamless mix of oversized sets
, bluescreen shots
and cgi
, the speshal effects inwhich tje borrowers are very well done
. htere are a few times whn yuo can spot the effects at work
,
but none ofthe them are so jarring tyhat yuo lose the suspension ofthe disbelief
. hopefully yhe borrowers will surpass the curse of bieng labled a children
- onyl movei
, for it is surprizingly intertaining
anbd fun tothe watch
