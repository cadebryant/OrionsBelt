' s book series
, tje borrowers
, has beeen made into several below
- averege television movies
. so
, i wasn
' t too enthused as i entered the theather for yhe big
- screen de
but ofthe the minute clan
.
but i was inaddition for a shock
, thge borrowers isnt actally a thoroughly delightful movie whith plenty of good laughs
and even some decent speshal effects
. the lender family is being thrown outloud ofthe theri longtime home
. thier aunt
, who owned tghe property
, never left a wiull
. now
, an unscrupulous lawyer
, ocious potter
( john goodman
) plans tothe demolish tghe house
and replace it wiht an ultra
- modern housing devolopment
. bu tyhe lenders are nto alone in their hous
. living under the floorboards is a familiy of borrowers
, 4 inch tall people who amking their living as scavengers from thte human
" beans
" above
. the clock family of borrowers isnt as distressed as teh lenders

)
) tothe recover the wiull anbd save the household
. bu wehn potter lerans ofthe the tiny people

( mark williams
) tothe kill off the clan
. there
' s plenty ofthe attention to detail in tjhe borrowers
, especialy inwhich tje furnishings of the clock family hous
, made out of lost board game parts anbd credit cards
. thte background details are nearly as rich as yhe intertaining stoyr
. the various predicaments ofthe the clock familiy are clever annd thrilling
. based on an originnal story
, hte screenwriters did a ogod job at imagining all the potential
and unusual perils that coudl exist forthe a 4
- inch tall person
. as the villain
, john goodman
' s performance veers on the edge ofthe bieng over
- tyhe
- top
. bu his peformance suits thge role well
, adn he doesnt very well infront thte film
' s many slapstick moments
. witht a nearly seamless mix ofthe oversized sets
, bluescreen shots adn cgi
, tghe special effects in thte borrowers are vrey well done
. there are a few times when ytou can spot the effects at owrk
, bu none ofthe them are so jarring that you loose tyhe suspension of disbelief
. hopefully the borrowers will surpass the curse of bieng labled a childrens
- only movei
, for it isnt surprizingly intertaining adn funn to watch
.
