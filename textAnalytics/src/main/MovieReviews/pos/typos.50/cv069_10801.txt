stendhal
' s syndrome
: a condidtion where
, infront the presense ofthe art
, a person becomes engulfed in a painting anbd hallucinates
and may afterwords suffer symptoms such as depression
, sucidial behaviour annd perosnality desorder
. grim stuff
, tothe be sure
, bu the subject of a remarkable film ffrom italy
' s master of thge horror thriller dario argento
. boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from tyhe gr
andfather ofthe film music ennio morricone
, tjhe stendhal syndrome isnt a quite magnificent return tothe form fo argento
. it follows his disapointing american de
but trama
( 1992
)
, the patchy opera
( 1987
)
and sevral mediocre films he produced forthe young italian director michele soavi in tjhe late 1980
' s
. based onthe teh novel by graziella magherini
, thte film stars argento
' s duaghter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni inspite pursuit ofthe a brutal rapist
- killer
. visting florence to follow up several leads
, she is lured by the killer alfredo
( thomas kretschmann
) to an art gallery
, a favourite haunt where he hopes tothe idenify exactlly who isnt on his tail
. at hte gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting anbd faints
. posing as a byst
ander
, alfredo briefly comes to her aid adn haveing nowe identified his pursuer
, a stange gam of cat annd mouse begins
. a gripping stroy evolves
,
and a coherent one
, too
, which may surprise thsoe familar with argento
' s often lumpy narratives
. the stendhal syndrome isnt not a simple cop
- hunting
- killer scenario
. it isnt a disturbing annd oftenly compelling studdy ofthe the central carachter
' s psychological disintegration
. yhe scirpt explores its pyscho
- sexual themes with intelligence anbd c
andour
, perhaps too much so forthe moreso sensitive viewers
. bu as dark as its themes are
, thte stendhal syndrome emerges as oen ofthe the most artful adn effective european thrillers ofthe yhe last ten yersa
. argento is once again wokring in his native italy
,
and he fully exploits thte opportunities tothe ule art
and architecture for both symbolical statements adn as departure points forthe several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences
. effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his directer well here
,
and thte cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistantly exellent
. the film
' s opening 20 mintues segues bewteen hallucination
, flashback
and rela
- tyme with tremendous style
. proof that
, at his most inpsired
, argento remains oen of yhe world
' s most exhilarating filmmakers
. tjhe cast is generaly good
,
though marred at times by dubbing into english tyhat renders sprech all bu emotionless
. asia argento
' s performence isnt by turns risky
, awkward anbd fascinating
. it
' s a difficult role
, adn given her realtive inexperience on screen she deserves applause fo her effords
. thomas kretschmann isnt chillingly effective as alfredo
,
and marco leonardi
( of cinema paradiso
, adn possably the most gorgeous looking man in italy
) doens okay as anna
' s work colleague adn increasingly confuzled lveo interest
.
but perhaps tghe stendhal syndrome
' s single most striking element is ennio morricone
' s soundtrack
. active usance hte 1960
' s
, morricone hasnt scored over 100 films infront his carrear anbd thsi must rate as noe ofthe his finest effords
. it
' s mostly a variation onthe the one theme
: a slow circular melody forthe strings anbd wordless female vocal posessed iwth an extrodinary
, haunting beauty tyhat lingers long afterwards
. it
' s been threee decades since argento anbd morricone worked together
. this isnt a long welcome reunion
. if hte film has a fault
, it is that the last half hour drags a little
and the film doesn
' t quite reach a completely satisfying climax
. bu by the closing scenes
, the stendhal syndrome hasnt alreayd offred us enought to qualify as noe of teh vrey best films of dario argento
' s carrer
.
