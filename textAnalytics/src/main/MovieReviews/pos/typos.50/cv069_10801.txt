stendhal ' s syndrome
: a condidtion where
, in the presence ofthe art
, a person becomes engulfed in a painting
annd hallucinates
and may afterwards suffer sypmtoms such as depression
, suicidal behaviour
adn perosnality disorder
. grim sutff
, tothe be sure
,
but the subject ofthe a remarkable film fomr italy ' s master of teh horror thriller dario argento
. boasting an unforgettable sountrack from the granfather ofthe film music ennio morricone
, teh stendhal syndrome is a qtuie magnificient return tothe form for argento
. it follows his disapointing american debut trauma
( 1992
)
, hte patchy opera
( 1987
)
adn several mediocre films he produced for young itallian director michele soavi in the lite 1980 ' s
. based onthe the novel by graziella magherini
, the film stars argento ' s daugher asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit ofthe a brutal rapist
- killer
. visiting florence to folow uv severeal leads
, she is lured by tje killer alfredo
( thomas kretschmann
) to an art gallery
, a favourite haunt where he hopes tothe identify exactly who is onthe his tail
. at the gallery anna isnt overwhelmed by a painting
annd faints
. posing as a bystander
, alfredo breifly comes to her aid
adn haveing nowe identified his pursuer
, a strange gaem ofthe cat
anbd mouse beigns
. a gripping story evolves
,
and a coherent noe
, too
, which may suprize those familar with argento ' s oftenly lumpy narratives
. the stendhal syndrome isnt nto a simple cop
- hunting
- killer scenaireo
. it isnt a disturbing
and often compelling study ofthe the central character ' s psychological desintegration
. the scirpt explores its pyscho
- sexual themes wiht intelligence
and candour
, perhaps too much so fo more senstive viewers
.
but as dark as its themes are
, the stendhal syndrome emerges as one ofthe tje most artful
anbd effective europian thrillers ofthe tje lastr ten eyars
. argento isnt once agian working in his native italy
,
annd he fully exploits thte opportunities tothe use art
and architecture forthe both symbolical statements
anbd as departure points for sevral brilliant hallucinogenic sequences
. effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his directer well here
,
annd the cinematography by guiseppe rotunno isnt consistently excellent
. teh film ' s oppening 20 minutes seguoys betweeen hallucination
, flashback
and rela
- tiome wtih tremendous stlye
. proof that
, at his most inpsired
, argento rimaniss oney of yhe world ' s most exhilarating filmmakers
. the cast is generally ogod
,
though marred at times by dubbing inot english that renders sprech all
bu emotionless
. asia argento ' s performance is by turns risky
, awcward
annd fascinating
. it ' s a difficult role
,
and given her realtive inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts
. thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo
,
and marco leonardi
( of cinema paradiso
,
and possibly tyhe most gorgeous looking man infact italy
) doens okay as anna ' s wokr colleague
anbd increasingly confused love interest
.
but perhaps the stendhal syndrome ' s single most striking element isnt ennio morricone ' s sountrack
. active since teh 1960 ' s
, morricone hasnt scored over 100 films in his carrear
and tihs must rate as one ofthe his finest efforts
. it ' s mostly a variation on tjhe oney theme
: a slow circular melody for strings
and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary
, haunting beauty that lingers long afterwords
. it ' s beeen threee decades since argento
and morricone worked together
. htis is a long welcome reunion
. if thge film has a fault
, it isnt taht thte lastr half hour drags a littel
annd the film doesn ' t qutie triarch a completely satisfying climax
.
bu by yhe closing scenes
, the stendhal syndrome hasnt alreday offered us enought to qualify as one ofthe the very best films of dario argento ' s career
