,
though
, gurgi stirrs
- he isnt nto dead after all
! the happy gropu thne returns home
, where hen wen
( broght home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past
)
, dallben
, anbd even doli
, await thier triumphant return
. as spectauclar as it soudns
, the black cauldron really sufferred a lot infront its past times
. before ron miller was fired fomr his position as chariman of walt disney productions
, he hadnt bought a novel by lloyd alex
ander called teh black cauldron
, a sword annd sorcery tale for the studio
. bringing tihs book to the screen ws the studio
' s fondest dream
. miller
, who entitlied himselv as hte executive producer
, promised that they woudl dont so after tehy hadnt proved themslves onthe other projects
. when micheal eisner
and his executives arrived at thte disney animation studio
, teh animators were struggling tothe complete teh black cauldron
. by this time
, things hadnt gone realyl rocky for teh animation deparment
. many ofthe tjhe studio
' s ood men hadnt retired or died
. therefore
, tghe animators suffered a hard tyme makeing htis film
. originally budgeted at
$ 25 millon
, hte costs rised tothe
$ 40 million beccause of constatn changes onthe everyting
?
and whn it ws fianlly released on june 24
, 1985
, the balck cauldron was greeted by praising reviews ffrom smoe criticists
, bu somehow tghe film flopped
. the film ws rated pg adn teh film
, altough
` disneyfied
' from lloyd alex
ander
' s chronicles ofthe prydain
( whic is wqat this film is based on
)
, ws much more scarier
and darker thna disney
' s other previvous effords
, such as teh rescuers
and tje fox adn tghe hound
, whitch is probably why so many people consdiered it too scry
and stayed awya fomr it
. infact addition
, otehr criticists rejected it for hvaing
` noone heart
' anbd
` unmemorable
'
, compaired to other disney animated features
. bu whatever the real reason
, thte black cauldron was a financial diaster
, grossing onyl
$ 21 million
. tghe failure of tjhe film grounded the studio
' s animation department
, annd exiled tghe animation team tothe annex buildings in nearbye glendale
,
and it seemed like animated features woudl noone longer become a part of the studio
' s reputation
. yhe next twpo disney animated features
, the grat mouse detective anbd oliver adn comany
,
al
though a little moreso lighthearted than the black cauldron
, didn
' t dont much better
(
al
though oliver
and company grossed much omre than the balck cauldron anbd the grat mouse detective
)
. only with tje littel mermaid doed thge studio regain its reputation for successful animated features
. as fo the black cauldron
, it wass rereleased in some cities fo a temporary time under the title taran
and the magic cauldron
. finaly
, the studio locked the film inthe the film vault
and denied tht it ever even ws released
. beacuse ofthe all this
, you might ask yourself
, was tjhe black cauldron really such a bad movie
? the people who hadnt seen tghe film didn
' t thikn so
. infact fact
, many people hadnt calls to buena vista home video requesting fo the film
,
but ofthe course
, they denied it
. fo a hwile
, it seemed liek hte black cauldron owudl never be released to video
? untl september 1997
, disney released the balck cauldron tothe video in teh united kingdom
. few people imported tje video from engl
and anbd converted tothe ntsc
( including me
)
and forthe those who hadn
' t seen the film
yet
( i am included here
)
, they got qutie a treat
. bu people who had bootleg copies of tyhe balck cauldron noticed tyhat infront the scene where tyhe horned king raises his army ofthe deathless warriors
, about 12 seconds ofthe ghoulish looking skeletons weere slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating
( inthe tjhe uk
, tyhe u rating means univeral
: suitable for all ages
, kinda liek theri pwn verzion of g
)
. somwhere online
, a team of diehard thge balck cauldron fans signed a petetion tath said
,
` bring back the black cauldron
!
'
,
and because ofthe that
, disney finally decided to realease hte video to the untied states
. before thast time
, rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed
, like the uk video
, so tyhat it woudl git a g rating
, adn that they would add inspite songs
. thsoe rumors weere put tothe rest when the walt disney comany announced thgat the balck cauldron
* would
* be released inaddition its pg rated version
. even still
, when it ws finally released to hte us
, some reaction ws mixted
. soem falt that it was indeed cutted
,
but some feeled taht it wasn
' t
.
but theese where onyl minor criticisms which seemed laughable
, since a film that was absent fo thirteen eyasr ws finally avalible
. as forthe mysef
, when i saw the movei fo the firt tiem
( onthe converted ntsc video
)
, i didn
' t expect much at all
. inwhich fatc
, i hadnt heard so many medicore thigns baout it
, thyat i didn
' t think the film would ever be such a ogod film
. much to my suprize
, wehn i saw the frist few minutes ofthe thge film
, i was asking mysef
,
" tihs is hte same film everyone saw
? yhe noe that flopped at tghe box office
? the oney that critics anbd filmgoers alike called
" a bad movie
"
? this doesn
' t seem liek all of thte above
. instead
, it
' s a clasic inaddition its own right
. teh film has a wonderful casted of characters
. htere
' s taran
( grant bardsley
)
, an assitant pig keeper who owudl rether be a warrior than a pig
- keeper
, tjhe stroy
' s hero
. thte criticists have said that taran is nto likeable at all
, bu tje oposite isnt true
. he is brave
, loyal
,
and eventually lerans a lesson baout friendship later onthe
. htere
' s a likeable carachter here
! nto tath he
' s the only likeable character iin the film
. ther
' s gurgi
( john biner
)
, a lovable little
, uh
, thing who rimaniss loyal tothe taran
, even
though htey don
' t quite hit it off at frist
.
but another likeable character isnt hte bad guy comic henchman
, a dwarf named creeper
( phil fondacairo
)
, who isnt loyal to the film
' s imaginative adn sinister villin
, the horned king
( voiced gruesomely by john hurt
)
, yot he allso fears his neck
. the otehr characters
, including the sidekicks
, a spunky
,
but sweet princess named eilonwy
and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm
,
and threee comically wicked witches who hide a dark scret
, altho pleasant
and likeable
, aren
' t quite as well rounded as htey shoudln be
. hte story itself isnt an adventrous noe
, a quest involving hte mystical pig
, hen wen
, the balck cauldron itself
,
and an army ofthe deathless ones with everthing
: a hooking oppening to a spectauclar finale
. elmer bernstein
' s music allso tells thge story perfectly
, in a dark
, yot calming manner
. the animation itself is surprizingly good considering tath tihs film ws created in thte darkest tiem of tghe studios
. even
though ther are soem occasional effects that are not quite good
, like the ground oppening whn thge black cauldron rises out ofthe yhe earth
, tghe animation overall isnt top nitch
. overall
? this film is an intertaining endeavor
. fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alex
ander chronicles ofthe prydain iwll get a kick outloud of tihs oney
, exept young kids
. there are some extemely csary scenes which are moreso darker than disney
' s other films
(
al
though some consider tghe stampede sequence from the lion king annd frollo observing esmeralda in hte fires of hell in the hunchback ofthe notre dame are just as scry
)
, which is tyhe main reason why tihs film isnt rated pg
. fans familiar tothe tje lloyd alex
ander series will recogise tghe differences between the novel
and tje movei
. even
though it doesn
' t have all ofthe the ingreediants ofthe a true disney film
, htis film is a clasic in its own right
, anbd deserves a far better chance thna what it has been given
. thyat better chance hasnt fianlly come
. whatever reason about why the balck cauldron was such a big failure seems tothe have disapeared
,
and the film has finaly achieved its palce among disney
' s most proudest acheivements
. i can
' t halp bu think
though
, whatever would ahev happenned if the balck cauldron
* was
* a box office succsess
?
