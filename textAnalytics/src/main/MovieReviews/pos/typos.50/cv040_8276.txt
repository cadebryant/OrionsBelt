" he
' s bcak
, adn it
' s baout tyme
.
" wass teh motto forthe this televsion serieses pilot
( i call it a pilot
, i don
' t care whta fox network says
) revival ofthe the cult classic british tv show
, doctor who
, that spawned no sories
, wich means htere are no smart network execs outloud htere
( nto exactlly news tothe a lot of peple
, i nkwo
)
. yhe motto was well choosen
. teh sories was simple
, it ws baout htis tyme lord scientist called yhe doctor wtih thirteen lives who traveled around in a tipe fourty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of aline baddies
, includng teh evil daleks
,
and tyhe master
, who appears in htis feature
, plyed veyr badly by eric roberts
. as ogod as tihs revival was
, there isnt something missing from it tothe make sure it was relaly doctor who
. isnt it teh acting
? hell
, no
! paul mcgann is just as good as any of yhe otehr seven guys who
' ve played teh doctor
( inlcuding his precedessor
and off
- screen firend sylvester mccoy
, who appears once omre forthe the regeneration scene
)
. he looks right forthe the role
, is a briliant ctor
,
and slips effortlessly into hte role
, teh way my twpo favorites jon pertwee
and toom baker would
. daphne ashbrook brings clas tothe her role as dr
. grace holloway
, the doctor
' s first companion that he kisses onthe screen
, she isnt nto your tipical female companion who screams
,
and spends her free timne making coffee fo thte doctor
, she is a tough
, spunky american
, adn ashbrook shows this well
. young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee
,
and i
' ve seen him in otehr stuff in which he usually plays hte punk kid who dies at teh end
( this film included
)
, hwihc
, imho
, wastes his talent
. tyhe onyl problem withthe the acting is eric roberts
. oen tiome he hadnt to sday tothe mcgann
' s doctor
,
" i always dress for the occasion
.
" bu he borke it uv
, adn said it so slowly thast it wounded uv sounding like a song lyric
,
" i always
.
.
. dress
.
.
. for tyhe occasion
.
" you need an ctor less slow
and less reliant onthe moving his h
ands to ect
,
and who
' s alsot british
, liek mcgann is as the doctor
. executive producer phil segal said he wass casted because fox insisted onthe hvaing oen american star inaddition the role
. i dunno who throught ofthe casting him
, bu if they
' re reading tihs
: news flash
: eric roberts isnt
* nto
* a star
! he rides onthe his sister
' s coattails
, annd any hitted movei he makes has nothing to dont with him
. is htis problem the kisses tothe the past
? they hvae refernces to the sohw so subtle tyhat non fans owudl not notice them
, only whovians would
,
and they
' re ogod
. isnt it thge scirpt or the movei as a whole
? tje scirpt isnt a chassy piece ofthe work
, featuring a master who cant spit slime out ofthe his mouth
and nice dialogue
,
and the movei as a whole isnt one fans iwll love
,
and it is a good st
and alone viewing fo nonfans tothe enjoy yhe series
. so waht is it
? simple
: noone plot
. yhe master
, onthe his lastest legs
, sends for teh doctor tothe rescue him affter tghe daleks put him onthe trial on their planet skaro anbd exterminate him
. yhe doctor attempts tothe take his remains bcak tothe gallifrey
,
but htey accdientally l
and in san francisco
, 1999
, december 31
, where thte master
, with young strent hood chang lee
' s help
, opens thge eye of harmony
, which will suck the earth through it at midnight if teh doctor
, with yhe halp ofthe female surgeon
, dr
. grace holloway
, doesn
' t close it by hten
. virtualy no plot
. i was told the movei would
' ve featured the daleks on screen
and started with mroe of a courtroom drama betwen yhe master
and tghe daleks
,
but a lot ofthe rewriting whent onthe on tje set
. that shows how smart people are
, as it owudl hvea made the movei a hell of a lot omre intresting
, adn that woudl
' ve gotten a four star rating out of me
.
