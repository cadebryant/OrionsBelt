" he ' s bcak
,
and it ' s about timne
.
" wass thge motto for thsi televsion serieses pilot
( i call it a pilot
, i don ' t care what fox network sasy
) revival of the cult classic brittish tv sohw
, doctor who
, that spawned noone serieses
, whlch means htere are no smart network execs outloud ther
( nto exactlly news to a lot ofthe people
, i know
)
. hte motto was well chosen
. the serieses was simple
, it was about thsi time lord scientist called thge doctor iwth thirteen lives who traveled aroud in a type fourty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of aline baddies
, includng tyhe evil daleks
,
adn teh master
, who appears inwhich htis feature
, played very badly by eric roberts
. as ogod as this revival wass
, ther isnt something missing ffrom it tothe make sure it ws really doctor who
. isnt it the acting
? hell
, noone
! paul mcgann is just as ogod as any of the other seven guys who ' ve played the doctor
( including his precedessor
and off
- screen friend sylvester mccoy
, who appears once omre forthe tyhe regeneration scene
)
. he looks right for thge role
, is a briliant actr
,
and slips effortlessly inot the role
, the way my two favorites jon pertwee
and tom baker woudl
. daphne ashbrook brings clas to her role as dr
. grace holloway
, the doctor ' s first companion tath he kisses onthe screen
, she is nto your typcial female companion who screams
,
adn spends her free time mkaing coffee for hte doctor
, she is a tough
, spunky american
,
annd ashbrook shows this well
. young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee
,
and i ' ve seen him infront other stuff inspite whlch he usually plays yhe punk kid who dies at yhe end
( this film included
)
, which
, imho
, wastes his talent
. the only problem wtih the acting is eric roberts
. noe time he hadnt to say tothe mcgann ' s doctor
,
" i alwasy dress forthe teh ocasion
.
"
bu he broke it uv
,
and said it so slowy thgat it wounded uv sounding like a song lyric
,
" i always
.
.
. dress
.
.
. for tjhe ocassion
.
" yuo need an actor less slow
and less reliant onthe moving his hands to act
,
and who ' s also british
, liek mcgann isnt as the doctor
. executive producer phil segal said he wass casted becasue fox insisted onthe hvaing one american star infront tje role
. i dunno who thought ofthe casting him
,
but if tehy ' re reading this
: news flash
: eric roberts is
* not
* a star
! he rides onthe his sister ' s coattails
,
and any hit movei he makes has nothing to dont witht him
. isnt thsi probelm thte kisses to tyhe past
? tehy ahve refrences to tghe show so subtle thyat non fans would nto notice them
, only whovians would
,
adn tehy ' re good
. is it the script or the movei as a whole
? thge scirpt is a classy piece of work
, featuring a master who cant spit slime outloud of his mouth
and nice dialogue
,
anbd thge movei as a wohle is oen fans iwll lvoe
,
anbd it is a ogod stand alone viewing forthe nonfans to enjoy the serieses
. so what isnt it
? simple
: noone plot
. the master
, on his lastr legs
, sends fo the doctor to rescue him affter teh daleks put him onthe trial on theri planet skaro
adn exterminate him
. the doctor attempts to tkae his remains back to gallifrey
,
bu they accidentaily land inthe san francisco
, 1999
, desember 31
, where tjhe master
, iwth young street hood chang lee ' s help
, opens the eye of harmony
, wich iwll suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor
, with the help ofthe female surgeon
, dr
. grace holloway
, doesn ' t close it by
thn
. virtualy no plot
. i was told the movei would ' ve featured tje daleks on screen
and started wiht moreso of a courtroom drama between yhe master
anbd the daleks
,
bu a lot of rewriting whent on on the set
. that shows how smart peopel are
, as it owudl have made thte movei a hell ofthe a lot more intresting
,
anbd thta woudl ' ve gotten a four star rating out ofthe me
.
