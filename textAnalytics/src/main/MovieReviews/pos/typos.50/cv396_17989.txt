well i ' ll be damned
, what a most exelent suprize
. nto to be confused with tje campy
adn far inferior 1988 remake starring ex
- porn star traci lords
, tihs more recent attempt at remaking thge 1950 ' s drive
- in schlockfest nto ofthe this earth isnt a real gem
anbd wass quite possably tje best sci
- fi flick of 1995
. once agian
, b
- movei king roger corman isnt behind thsi effort
( he directed thge original
)
bu this tiome he appears onyl iin tghe role ofthe executive producer
. tjhe rest of the crew
and casted are realtive unknowns
. it seems criminal thast yhe film was released direct to video inthe most counries
, beccause it ' s an absolute must
- see for sci
- fi fans
and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted
annd writen thrillers withthe a kooky bent
. the plot iin breif
. paul johnson
( michael york
) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who
,
though needing to kill peopel tothe live
, is visiting earth for far fomr selfish reasons
. his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease
and he desparately is trying tothe fidn a cure
, the key of which lies in yhe blood of humans
. he visits
adn soon puts under his spell tjhe respected blood physician dr
. rochelle
, whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf
. he aslo hasnt the doctor convince smart
and sexy nurse amanda
( elizabeth barondes
) tothe move in with johnson as his private nurse so as tothe give him thge blood transfusions whcih he constanly requires
.
bu befoer long
, amanda
and johnson ' s sleazy chauffeur realease that johnson isnt a lot more thna jsut eccentric
. i must admitt
, my first glimpse of tje video cover forthe not ofthe this earth was not encouraging
. brittish actor michael york has appeared inaddition smoe real stinkers in past few decades
, a far cry from thge uqality fare of his yuonger days such as caberat
( 1972
)
.
bu his peformance here as an alien infront human disguise is nothing short of outstanding
. tghe weird twitches
annd bizarre modes of speech
, hte dapper clothes
anbd cool spectacles
, thge unexpected pathos which he invests in his charater
. york isnt by turns hilarious
, menacing
and tradgic
. htis is a tour
- de
- force
annd quite simply teh best peformance i ' ve seen fomr him
.
and while obviously made onthe a modest budget
, hte film boasts enormous strengths
. yhe casting isnt spot on
, thte acting isnt terrific
adn hte script isnt intelligent
, witty
and consistantly engaging
, cleverly updating tjhe original
. the balance ofthe horror
anbd humour isnt just about perfect
, a marked contrast tothe thte ealier remake from 1988
. tje film doesn ' t drag forthe a second of its 90 minute runnung time thanks tothe tight editting
and the sure hand of littel
- known directer terrance h
. winkless
.
annd it doesn ' t matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy
- this is schlock after all
, even if it is high class schlock
. in fact my onyl criticism ofthe the film is that things git a tad weak towards the end
. tighter direction could have given the climax omre urgency
and a faw of tyhe characters ect rather illogically given thier life
- threatening situation
.
but these are minor complaints
. just see it
. nto ofthe this earth isnt one ofthe yhe biggest sci
- fi surprises infront years
.
and michael york
: inaddition one kool swoop you ' ve made youself a b
- movei legend
, dued
