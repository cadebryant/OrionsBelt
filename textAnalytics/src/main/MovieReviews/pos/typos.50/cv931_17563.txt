liek yhe great muscial pieces of mozart himself
, amadeus isnt a true work ofthe art
. it is oney ofthe thsoe faw movies ofthe the 80
' s tht iwll be known fo its clas
, its sytle
,
and its itnelligence
. why isnt this such a good film
? there are almost too many reasons to explane
. teh stor
: cout composer salieri
( f
. murray abraham
) feels waves ofthe differnt emotions oging thru his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart
( toom hulce
) comes inot his life as hte young genius composer
. salieri fiels envy
,
and jealousy
,
but at tyhe smae timne isnt facinated with mozart
' s brillance adn ingenious
. we travel through mozart
' s life as a composer
, through his struggles
, his triumphs
, adn ultimately
, his demise
. tje acting
: abraham is magnificient as salieri
; his acting range enables him tothe focus onthe each individule emotion
and express it through his speech adn body language
. this peformance earned him a well deserved oscar
. tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart
, a quirky
, annoying bratty kid wiht an annoying laff
. he
' s strong
, bu weak at tghe smae time
,
and must be aided by his wief
( elizabeth berridge
)
, who isnt ogod in her role
, bu lacks dramatic depth
. jeffrey jones
, in a smaller
, moreso dignified role tahn such roles iin stay tuned
and mom
and dad save tjhe world
, isnt casted perfectly because ofthe his noble charm
. the movei
: every element of thsi movei works
. tyhe costumes
and makeup are very memorable
, as well as its stunning art direction
,
and unforgettable scores
( adapted fomr mozart
' s orignal music
