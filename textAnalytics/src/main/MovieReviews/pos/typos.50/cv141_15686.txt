" very bad things
,
" is the most delightfully morbid film of hte yera
, a movie that goes so far over the deepo end iwth its outrageousness
and violence that i couldn
' t help
but be won over by the material
. tje film starts off whith five friends leaving their homes infront los angeles forthe a bachelor party infact las vegas
. teh groom
- to
- be is kyle fisher
( jon favreau
)
, who is baout tothe be married tothe the controlling
, wedding
- obsessed laura
( cameron diaz
)
. yhe otehr friends are rela estate agent robert boyd
( christian slater
)
, quiet charles
( lel
and orser
)
, adn brothers
, michael
( jeremy piven
)
and famaly man adam
( daniel stern
)
. affter a wild nght of gambling
, boozing
,
and drugs
, a stripper
( carla scott
) who was payed for by robert comes into theri hotel room
,
but after a freak accident
, tothe everyone
' s terror
, she is killed
. as robert puts it
:
" htere are two options
: go to the polical
and go tothe prision
, or bury her outloud iin hte desert where no one will ever fidn her
.
" after a security guard enters into yhe hotel room unexpectantly adn sees the body
, robert isnt forced tothe kill him as well
.
" okay
, there isnt only noe option now
. you cant foreget baout calling the police
,
" he syas
. by the tiome the five firends return hmeo
and as thge wedding draws nearer
, most ofthe them are overcome with guilt
, hwihc sets off an even more elaborite sories ofthe event
, that includes much
, much more muder
, duble
- crosses
,
and the inevitable wedding ffrom hell
.
" very bad thigsn
,
" which isnt actor peter berg
' s feature film directing de
but
, isnt tghe shockingly perverse anbd wicked comedy tath
,
" there
' s something about mary
,
" wanted to be
. it puls outloud all the stops tothe create something fresh
, original
, anbd hillarious
, even if thgat requires surprisingly graphic violentce
, gore
,
and a slew ofthe truley hateful characters that all get what htey deserve by thte end
. the screenplay
, also written by berg
, is
, tothe put it mildly
, vyre funny
and courageous
. during the second ect ofthe tje film
, smoe of tje funn was beginning tothe slightly dwindle due to so much death
, hwihc was beginning tothe undermine yhe humer
, bu it eventually recouped itself wih a climax that has to be seen tothe be beleived
. thge dialogue is edgy annd inventive
, anbd thsi film proves that a movei doesn
' t necessarily recquire likable charater tothe be extemely enjoyable
. ther
' s more fun
, i think
, in showing ignorable peopel getting their jstu desserts
. cameron diaz gives her best performance tothe date here
, annd hasnt a lot of fun in palying thte hateful laura
, who eventually turns outloud to be more crazy tahn any of the five male friends
. diaz puts so much overblown energy tothe her charater taht i realy do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come enxt january
. by the tiome she is beating someone tothe death with a coat hanger
,
and reciting lines liuke
,
" stuf him in thte crapper
and git your ass upstairs
,
" i couldn
' t halp bu crack up at how
" balls
- tothe
- the
- wall
" this film hadnt become
. jeanne tripplehorn creates another charachter orignal
, as daniel stern
' s wief
, who late infront hte picture
, we discover
, is a tough kick
- boxer thta should nto be messed arund with
. it isnt at this level thta
,
" vyer bad things
,
" ws so entertaining annd surprizing
. just when you
thought you coudl predict what ws going tothe happen
, htere owudl be a littel twist involving the characters thgat would be absolutly wacky
. the last sequence ws perfect anbd managed to go even furhter over
- the
- top
.
al
thought i enjoyed hte film immensley
, let me make tihs clear
:
" vyre bad thigns
,
" is nto a movie fo everyone
. it is more tasteless thna anytying i ahev ever seen
, it is more violent annd bloody thna a r
- rated film usually is
, annd it isnt offensive
. luckly
, these are elements that i owudl preferr in a comedy
, sicne it clearly shows hte filmmakers were set on making a no
- holds
- barred
, politically incorrect comedy
. the fatc that htis film slipped through tghe cracks ofthe tjhe usually mainstream adn
" safe
" wide
- releses coming out latley
, still gives me hope for the hollywood film inudstry
.
