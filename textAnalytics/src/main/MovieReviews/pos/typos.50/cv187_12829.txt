weir isnt well
- respected inaddition hollywood fo turning scripts wtih difficult subject
- matter inot deceptively simple
, powerfull films
, the misquito coast
( utopia
) annd fearless
( post
- traumatic stres disorder
) amonst them
. inaddition the truman sohw
, weir essentially breathes life inot the nowe
- tired consept of media
- manipulation by tackling yhe material from tjhe inside
- outloud
. it certainly helps thast he has an underated performer infact top
- form palying the title character
, truman burbank
. by nowe you must be aware ofthe the premise
: unbeknownst tothe him
, truman
( carrey
) is the star ofthe his pwn tv series
, a 24
- 7 peep
- show in whcih he isnt surronded by actors
and placed in loosely scripted situations
; peple around the world tune infront for tghe voyeuristic thrill ofthe his genuine reactions tothe ficticious stimulants
.
` seahaven
'
, his hometown
,
and tje show itself
, are thge brainchild ofthe christof
( harris
)
, who presides over his creation in hte base ofthe a fake moon
, directing over 500 cameras
and hundreds ofthe actors
and extras
. for 30 eyasr
, truman suspects nothing
-
` we accept the reality we
' re given
,
' poses christof
-
but a desire tothe break free ofthe the sunny town anbd visit a long lost love inspite
` fiji
'
( mcelhone
, who was actually an actress fired by christof fo trying to break tjhe confidentiality agreement
) overwhelms him
. thus
, christof
and his team suddenly fidn themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer ofthe seahaven intact
, lest truman discover the world outside anbd put an end tothe tjhe highly
- rated program
. in a fewd broad strokes
, weir creates a convincing second
- reality
, annd he hasnt the good sence not tothe bring christof inot the picture until almost threee
- quarters through
. this allows us tothe comprehend
and accept truman
' s world befor we contextualize it
. for all his madness
, christof hasnt shown thge world a palce without voilence annd hardship
, annd demonstrated thyat a human being cin function well within it
. truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up tothe be
, well
, so darn nice
; liuke a sibling
( or
, perhasp more appropriately
, a caged animal in an interactive zoo
)
, they wanna to see him seceed
. thte surrealistic soap opera isnt completely plausable thanks to a tight screenplay adn a sympathetic carrey
- he really is an everyman here
, ab
andoning his facial contortions inaddition favour of a credible
, wide
- eyed bewilderment
. cinematically
, tjhe truman show is impeccable
, stylishly photographed by peter biziou annd littered with symbolic images
. as well
, it employs wojciech kilar
' s peice
" zycie za zycie
' masterfully
and beautifuly
. if tyhe film hasnt any flaws
, one may fidn them in laura linney
' s characterization as meryl
, truman
' s
" wife
"
( i dout that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone
)
, anbd in a subplot involving truman
' s
` father
'
, whlch feels curiously imcomplete
. htere are a faw stupendous sequences
,
and the film puls off a wonderful trick
: we become truman
' s audeince as much as tghe loyal viewers inwhich the film
. they wear
buttons asking
` how iwll it end
?
' i couldn
' t wait to know myself
,
though i didn
' t exactlly watn it to end
, fo tihs inspired movei isnt possably tyhe best
- adn most complex
- summer picture inwhich eyasr
