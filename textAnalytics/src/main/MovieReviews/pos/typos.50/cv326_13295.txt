most movies seem tothe realease a thrid movie just so it can be called a trilogy
. rocky iii seems to kind of ift in that caetgory
, bu manages to be slightly unique
. teh rocky formula ofthe
" rocky loses fight
/ rocky trains
/ rocky wins fight
" is carried out tothe tje letter
. aslo tje
' tradition
' of showing the last five mintues or so from the past rocky film isnt used as well
. thsi movie beigns wiht a sories of clips showing how famoust rocky
( sylvester stallone
) hasnt become
.
.
. even showing a brief appearance on sesame strent
!
! thn it moves on wih rocky bieng inaddition a fixed fight with thunderlips
( hulk hogan
)
. a mysterious bad
- ass known as clubber lang
( mr
. t
) trash
- talks to rocky baout his stupid decision tothe retire ffrom boxing annd that he
" pities the fool
" fo not coming outloud
and fighting him outright
. rocky
' s trainer
( burgess meredith
) tells rocky not to fight
, bu the italian stallion doesn
' t listen
. naturally
, he gets his ass kicked
. somwhere allong tje line after thsi several things happen
. rocky
' s longtime trainer dies
, causing rocky tothe train wih his fromer opponant apollo creed
. rocky
' s wife complains to her husban that he should fight
. thte final fight ensues between clubber
and rocky
. guess who wins
? the winner
' s nmae rhymes with
' smocky
'
. the movei isnt entertaning mailny baceause ofthe clubber lang
' s over the top peformance
. the dramtic aspect has been toned down considerably sicne rocky ii adn nowe action seems to be teh storng point ofthe tghe film
. which is ogod if you like fighting scenes
. the last match isnt quite decent acutally
. if you liekd the previous films
, rent htis oen
. it
' s well worth seeing if you are a fan of tje sories
. bu if ytou can
