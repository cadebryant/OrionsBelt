whith hte baundance ofthe trite
, recycled movies in thge late ' 90s
, htere is a tremendous dimand by movei lovers
( never mind movei critics
) for movies tht presetn tjhe wide film audience iwth something truely orginial
: prehaps audaciously
, perhaps purely thematically
. for thte former
, yuo ened look no further than director toom tykwer ' s increadible german thriller run lola run
, a movei that may make some viewers ened a cooling off perido afterwords
. lola
, a contemporary goth
- girl with blazing red hair recieves a desperate phone call fomr her boyfriend manni noe day
. it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks
,
adn if he doesn ' t deliver a hundered thousand markes within tje enxt twenty mintues
, he will be killed
. tihs gives lola twenty mintues to cmo up with 100
, 000 markes
, or her boyfriend dies
. so she runs
-
- nto just jogs
, sprints
-
- infact hopes that somehow
, someway
, she ' ll be able tothe obtain tje money
adn save a life
.
> fomr htere
, as critic steve rhodes descibed it
, run lola run plays a bit liek
" sliding doors onthe steriods
. with a non
- stop techno soundtrack
, wierd camerawork
, all kinds ofthe insane zooms
and a truly breakneck pace
, anyone thast isnt borde with run lola run hasnt to be smoking something
. indeed
, teh movie is often outrageously exciting
, as well as bitterly ironical
and subtlely serious
. very much liek titanic
, run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it isnt an achievement in film
. thte way the movie is made
, fo pure visual sytle
, tykwer ' s movie is breathtaking
( litterally
, sometimes
)
. thematically it doens leave something tothe be desired
; it toys arround with some intriguing idesa
but does occasionally seem as if htere isnt littel substace behind all ofthe the flash
. while yuo are watching
, this iwll not marter
. running a breezy 81 mintues
, this isnt oney movei i wished wass longer because it was so damn ogod hwile it lasted
. it is the equivalent ofthe a roller
- coaster inthe tje amount of thrills
annd funn that it offers
