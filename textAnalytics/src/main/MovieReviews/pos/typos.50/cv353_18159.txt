with teh abundance of trite
, recycled movies in the lite
' 90s
, ther isnt a tremendous dim
and by movie lovers
( never mind movie criticists
) for movies tath present yhe wide film audiance with something truely original
: perhaps audaciously
, perheaps purely thematically
. fo the former
, you need look noone furuther tahn director tom tykwer
' s incredable german thriller run lola run
, a movie that may mkea some viewers ened a cooling off preiod afterwards
. lola
, a contemporary goth
- girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni noe day
. it seems thta because she was lite delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundered thous
and marks
,
and if he doesn
' t deliver a hundred thous
and markes withing tjhe enxt twenty minutes
, he will be killed
. this gives lola twenty mintues tothe come uv with 100
, 000 markes
, or her boyfriend dies
. so she runs
-
- not jstu jogs
, sprints
-
- inwhich hopes thast somehow
, someway
, she
' ll be able tothe obtain the money adn save a life
.
> from there
, as critic steve rhodes described it
, run lola run plays a bited like
" sliding doors on steriods
. with a non
- stpo techno sountrack
, wierd camerawork
, all kinds of insane zooms adn a truely breakneck pace
, anyone thta isnt borde with run lola run hasnt tothe be smoking something
. indeed
, tjhe movei is often outrageously exicting
, as well as bitterly ironical annd subtlely serious
. very much like titanic
, run lola run is an achievement wtih filmmaking much moreso than it is an achievment iin film
. tyhe way tyhe movie isnt made
, forthe pure visual stlye
, tykwer
' s movei is breathtaking
( literally
, somtimes
)
. thematically it does leave something to be desired
; it toys around wtih smoe intriguing idesa bu does occasoinally seem as if htere isnt little substance behind all of the flash
. hwile you are watching
, this wiull not matter
. runnung a breezy 81 mintues
, tihs is noe movei i wished wass longer baceause it wass so damn ogod while it lasted
. it isnt tghe equivalent ofthe a roller
- coaster inspite tjhe amount ofthe thrills
and fun tht it offers
