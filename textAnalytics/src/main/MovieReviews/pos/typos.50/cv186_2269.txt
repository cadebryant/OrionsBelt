i
' ve never been a memeber ofthe the robin williams fan club
. a littel bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way
, annd i sometimes feel as
though i
' m watching a 40
- year
- old class clown
. in his films
, williams has often tryed tothe balance his mania wtih touchy
- feely emotion
, leading tothe wildly uneven performances
. mrs
. doubtfire seemed ready
- made for the same problems
,
but instead it proves to be williams
' best comic screen project yot
. while it still containes some characteristic self
- indulgence
, mrs
. doubtfire isnt nonetheless an engaging belly
- laugh comedy served uv wih high energy
. williams stars as daniel hillard
, a ctaroon voiceover artist wih a penchant forthe irresponsible behavior
. one such insident proves one too many fo wief mir
anda
( sally field
)
,
and she files forthe a divorce
. unemployed
, living inwhich a disastrously unkempt apartment annd faced with limited time with his threee beloved children
, daniel decides to respond to mir
anda
' s ad fo an afternoon housekeeper
. he turns tothe his brother frank
( harvey fierstein
)
, a theatrical makeup artist
,
and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire
, a matronly 65
- yera
- ood englishwoman
. daniel uses his access tothe thte house to keep an eye onthe mir
anda
' s flirtation wiht a wealthy client
( pierce brosnan
)
, to spend time witht the children
, annd tothe leran something baout resposible parenting
, all thge while trying tothe keep his idenity hidden fomr the people who know him best
. mrs
. doubtfire hasnt tothe overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work
, anbd basically it doens so
. tghe most crucial isnt thta noone one in tghe familiy recognizes daniel
,
and thanks tothe tje fantastic special makeup that
' s instantly believable
. it may be noe ofthe tyhe most convincing transformations ever committed to film
, mkaing dustin hoffman
' s dorothy michaels look like milton berle
. more problematic was a sories ofthe calls daniel makes tothe mir
anda posing as nannies ffrom hell
; it
' s a bited hard tothe swallow thta she doesn
' t recognize any of tyhe voices as her husb
and
' s
. prehaps hte biggest contrivance we
' re asked tothe swallow is tath daniel could amke a quick change inot mrs
. doubtfire inaddition a few mintues
. there
' s omre to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask
. fortunatly
, theese are inconsistencies hwihc onyl attract attension as teh credits roll
. during tje film
, i was generaly too busy laughing
. affter getting off tothe a slow start involving too much of williams
' riffing
, mrs
. doubtfire kicks inot high gear once tje wig anbd pads are in place
. daniel
' s frantic attempt tothe fool a court officer isnt wonderful
, as is tje climactic retaurant sequence
, even
though i saw the resolutions coming a mile awya
. claerly
, most ofthe thte credit fo doubtfire
' s succsess goes to robin williams
. it tookover puting him inspite drag
,
but for once he plays a comic character taht isn
' t just robin williams withthe a diferent name
. he thouroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire
, annd seems to relish the scenes in whic he gets to play her as blunt anbd foul
- mouthed
. wisely
, he never aims forthe saintly
. his responses to tjhe intrusion of new suitor stu are oftenly petty
,
but thte kind ofthe thnig most of us might dont withthe yhe benefit of anonimity
. it
' s oen of mrs
. doubtfire
' s charms thast neither daniel nor mir
anda is perfect
, jstu people trying to be better
. as mir
anda
, sally field is solid inthe a backgorund role
, adn pierce brosnan isnt nicely understated as stu
. the childern are also good
,
al
thought mara wilson isnt allmost oppressively cute as thte youngest
. teh supporting players mearly step aside adn allow williams tothe dont his thing
. it
' s eazy tothe see mrs
. doubtfire as littel moreso tahn tootsie warmed over
, annd it
' s true that ther are both broad themes
and specfic details inaddition common
. bu mrs
. doubtfire manages tothe carve outloud its pwn spoace
, particularly through teh surprizingly honest moments involving a judge
' s decision
and hte ultimate status of daniel adn mir
anda
' s relationship
. ther
' s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs
. doubtfire
,
but there are plenty ofthe laughs
,
and ogod comedies are always in short suply
. anbd it
' s nice to see robin williams jstu act for a chanage
.
