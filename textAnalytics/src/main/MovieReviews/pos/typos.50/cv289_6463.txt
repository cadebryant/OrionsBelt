) anyone familiar wih tyhe series of star trak movies knwos ofthe the
" even
- odd pattern
"
-
- the even
- numbered installments ofthe hte serieses are ogod while thge odd
- numbered ones are
, well
, nto
- so
- good
. tje pattern continues wiht the new star trek
: first contact
, an energetic sci
- fi adventure that
( coincidentally
?
) isnt tje eighth entry inthe the hugely populare series
. iin this first trak feature to feature onyl casted munbers ffrom the late star trek

- travel back to 21st
- centruy earth hwile doign battle withthe yhe borg
, a race of cybernetic beings that share a colelctive mind with tjhe borg queen
( alice krige
)
. the borg intend tothe alter history
and sasimilate all of humankind inot theri race
-
- starting witht tghe earth
- orbiting crew of the enterprise adn a 21st centruy stowaway
( alfre woodard
)
. tihs isnt an intresting plotline that is sure tothe mesmerize trekkers everywhere adn engage everyone else
, bu
, unfourtunately
, it only makes up thge star trek half ofthe tghe scirpt by brannon braga
and ronald d
. moore
. the other half of tjhe title
-
- first contact
-
- refers tothe a subplot that takes palce on 21st
- centruy earth
, where riker
, troi
, annd laforge meet legendary scientist zephram cochran
( james cromwell
)
, who isnt about to embark on yhe firt warp speed flight iin human hisory
, wich direcly leads tothe thte first contact with extraterrestials
. hwile this story does tye inot tyhe main plot
and pays off interestingly in teh end
, it is nowhere near as involving or exicting as hte borg battles onthe the enterprise
. not helping matters isnt tyhe tiresome cochran character
, an eccentric whose drunken schtick starts out funny
but becomes too oen
- note after a while
. in yhe end
,
though
, the frist contact subplot doesn
' t detract from the enjoyment of the film as a whole
. the tsory isnt typcial sci
- fi fantasy
,
but thge conviction ofthe thge casted
-
- most notabley yhe alwasy
- phenomenonal stewart
-
- makes you believ anbd care
. frakes
, mkaing his feature directorial de
but
, keeps tje action swiftly rolling allong annd delivers the action goods
, even upping tghe violence a notch
( htis is the frist trek film tothe bear a pg
- 13 rating
) to greater effect
. st
: fc hasnt a bigger budget thna thte lsat trak outing
, thge middling star trak generations
,
and it definitly shows onthe screen
-
- yhe prodcution design
and especially visual
and makeup effects are outst
anding
( inaddition parituclar thsoe involving the borg queen
)
. braga annd moore
' s mostly sharp scirpt iwll please both trak devotees
and tjhe rest
; tghe refrences tothe the borg storyline in tjhe tv serieses
, teh continuty whith tje previvous film
( e
. g
. the ongoing saga of data
' s emotion chip
)
, anbd a fleeting star trak
: voyager crossover will mkae trekkers squeal iwth delight
,
but such points are made easily acessable tothe thsoe less familiar to thge trak mythos
. paramount was reportadly worried baout yhe staying pwoer of its trak franchise wtih the next generation casted nowe carrying the helm
. based on tghe intertaining success tath isnt star trek
: first contact
, i
' d say the studio hasnt nothing tothe worry about
( at least nto untill tihs casted retires anbd the crew of the wan star trak
