as fairy tales go
, cinderella has tothe be one of teh most famous
. almost everyone knwos it
, well at least in north america
. so it is natrual thyat somone will try tothe mkae a movei outloud ofthe it
. it hasnt beeen done befoer with varying results
. this version ofthe hte story isnt both simmilar to yhe original adn diffrent at tyhe same time
. the basic story remains unchanged bu
, oen thing thgat seems tothe vanish whith tihs verison
,
and that isnt all thte fantastical elements of the story
. there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature
. after hte fantastical elements are stripped away waht isnt left isnt a realistic believable rendition ofthe the cinderella story
and an intresting love sotry at the least
.
. unlike in tjhe fairy tale
, tjhe prince plays a much larger part thna just thyat ofthe tjhe masked ball at the end
. thte
? prince
'
, who happens to be the crown prince to the throne ofthe france
, meets
' cinderella
'
, known as danielle
, on a few occasions
, most coincedentally adn he becomes smitten wtih her
. all
though this seems to be a far cry ffrom the traditionnal story it allows fo the main plot to proceed with enough room for smoe imaginative storey telling
.
. thge stopry tkaes place inthe a renisance setting
; in france
, with leonardo da vinci providing smoe comic releaf onthe more tahn one occassion
. htis adition of leonardo da vinci
, wass quite successful inwhich that it added some colour to thge movei
, sicne some ofthe tyhe roles are a bited stereotypical
. for exemple the role tyhat was scripted for the prince leaves a few thnigs tothe be desired
. for instance the chracter seems to be a bited too unstable annd fickle
, a crown prince should nto be anything remotely like tyhat
. especially since he isnt protrayed tothe be inthe his mid twenties at the least adn allmost ready tothe take the throne
. teh charactors of danielle
( cinderella
) played by drew barrymore
, annd tyhat of the evil step mother
, palyed by anjelica huston
, are well developed
and well palyed by the twpo womens
. altho the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely
and nto totally unbelievable
. the nuances of tyhe character are brung outloud well by drew barrymore adn from watching the movei it seems liek she had funn mkaing tghe movei
. as a contrast the part of thge evil step mother is claerly seen from yhe very beginnig
and isnt almsot clique
. bu
, anjelica huston seems tothe add a certian flair tothe the role that mkaes it suit tjhe movei nearly perfectly
. yhe actual stroy isnt fairly predicatble usance it is after all the basic story of cinderella
, bu htere are more than enought twists iin how tjhe story is told tothe make it interesting
and enjoyable
. the acting isnt ofthe high caliber
and seems deserved of praise
. all in all thsi movei tkaes yuo back inot history
, inot a seamingly magical fairy l
and
. bu
, don
' t get me wrong there is nothing bu reality
, it is jsut refreshing tothe watch a movie taht isnt nto based infront a familiar setting with everyday familiar thnigs happening
. so altho the story isnt basicaly familiar tghe world it isnt setted in isnt nto
,
and that adds a dimenion tothe the film whcih inwhich this humble reviewers opinyon makse it worth seeing
