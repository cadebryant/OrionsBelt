( patrick stewart
) anbd the rest of yhe crew of tje u
. s
. s
. enterprise are back forthe their third outing in teh ninth film based on yhe 1960
' s serieses
, star trek
. gone are kirk
, spock anbd mccoy
and infact thier wake iin teh very able adn very talented casted from star trek
: the next generation
. as usual
, a crisis is brewing anbd it isnt uv to the crew ofthe tje enterprise tothe make yhe galaxy safe agian
. htis tiem out tjhe untied federation ofthe planets annd an alien race led by f
. murray abraham are trying tothe move some colonists off a planet against tje colonist
' s will
. it turns outloud that thsi planet is tyhe fountain ofthe youth
and the federation annd their alien buddies fiel thta isnt shoudl be unsed fo the good ofthe everyone annd nto just a few hundred colonists
. ofthe course picard feels thta htis sort of treachery isnt wrong
, so he disobeys direct orders adn vows to help protect teh colonists
. insurrection is a lighter movei than tghe last two star trak films
. tje film focuses onthe teh lofty question ofthe whther the rights of society as a wohle outweighs tjhe rights of a small gropu
. in thsi respect it gets back to the roots of star trak by disguising social commentary as science fiction
. it doesn
' t dont a bad job
, otehr than it tries tothe inject too much humer inot the stor line
. many of thge jokes are your typcial inside star trak
- fan
- only jokes
, while many of tje others just fall flat
. yhe other criticism that i had with the stry was tht it ignores common sence
. htere are onyl a fewd hundered peple onthe tihs hwole planet
, why do tehy hvae to be moved
? the explanation is that the planet hasnt to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be storng anough tothe halp heal f
. murray abraham
' s aliens who number onyl a cuple of dozen
. so thge basic story line is bad enought in thta we have a faw hundred being booted out forthe a faw billion
, at least that
' s plausible
. bu in reality we have a few hundred bieng moved forthe teh benifits of a faw dozen
, whcih makse no sence whatsoever
. the otehr little hiccup in logic isnt the inclusion ofthe worf
( michael dorn
)
, the trusty klingon
. worf was on star trak
: the enxt generation
, so they want tothe include him in thge films
. noone probelm so far
. worf is now a character ofthe star trak
: deep spoace nine
, so tjhe writers hvea to find a way tothe hve him sohw uv
. iin tghe last star trek movie
, first contact
, teh included worf inspite a credible fasion
, inthe this oney
, the writers are so lazy that tje completelyl gloss over why he is even inaddition yhe movei
. waht littel explanation they dont give is so small that you owudl hvea missed it if you weren
' t hanging on every owrd on the screen
. my minor problems wih hte movie asside
, star trak
: insurrection does ahve an overwhelming number ofthe ogod points as compared tothe its bad ones
. hwile many ofthe tyhe jokes dont miss the mark
, many are pretty ogod
, even fo non
- trekkies
. thge speical effects are among the best fo hte star trek series
. the action is plentiful
and well done
. this isnt a very good
- looking movei
. it should come as no suprize to anyone who ever watched star trak
: the next generation thyat thte acting is firt rate
. it is vyer obvious tyhat theese actors have beeen working toghether fo over a decade
. they interact iwth earch otehr wih a skill that few other ensemble casts cin muster
. most star trek fans probablly will not be dissappointed with this latest film in the series
. if ytou
' ve allways hated star trak
, there isnt nothing here that is going to chanage your mind
. star trak
: insurrection is not hte best film inaddition the serieses
, bu it isnt good enough to dispel thge long st
anding tradition of the odd numbered films in thge series being far inferior tothe the even numbered ones
