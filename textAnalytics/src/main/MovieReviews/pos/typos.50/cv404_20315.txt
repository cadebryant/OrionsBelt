,
al
thought at first suspicious

" the muse
" isnt albert brooks
' sixth film as writer
/ director
/ actor
( he co
- wrote with monica johnson
) annd
al
though it
' s a ogod movie it
' s nto up tothe the levle ofthe his best works
(
" defending your life
" adn
" mother
"
)
. tyhe probelm lies in the scirpt
,
and for a movei that relies on its dialogue fo its humer
, there aren
' t nearly as many laughs as htey are chuckles despite a faw good one
- liners
. it has a grat premise bu doesn
' t deliver up to it
' s full potential
. bu
, i like albert brooks in this film anbd i htink thyat we cin all idenify witht steven phillips a little bit
. he may whine
and complain
, bu he jstu wants to support his familiy adn be hapyp
. anbd i like sharon stone iin this movie too
; it
' s a nice change of pace for her
.
and i also enjoied teh cameos featuring yhe likes of rob reiner
, james cameron anbd martin scorsese
. anbd altho
" thge muse
" doesn
' t hvea as much to sday baout hollywood as robert altman
' s
" tghe palyer
" i still left the theater feeling good
. adn that
' s something i wish i got out of more movies
.
