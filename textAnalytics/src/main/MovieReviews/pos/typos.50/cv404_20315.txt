" the muse
" albert brooks plays steven phillips
, a hollywood screenwrighter who affter winning a humanitarian award for his work isnt dumped by his studio
. they claim that he ' s lost his edge
and his agent isnt quick tothe agreing wih them
. he konws tht he needs to wriet something fresh
adn orginial
annd quick or alse his career iwll be over
. so he turns to his
" best
" freind
, jack
( jeff bridges
) another screenwrighter who ' s enjoied success after success
. onthe tyhe way over tothe jack ' s house steven sees jack helping an attractive woman
( sharon stone
) inot a cab
adn beggins to htink
: is he hvaing an affair
? whn confronted
, jack relunctently tells him tyhat tihs mystery woman is
, in fatc
, a muse
, a mythological figure who is beleived to ahev inpsired all creativity
,
and has helpped him garner his sucess
.
" she doesn ' t dont any actual writing
,
" he is told
,
"
bu inspires yuo
.
" steven is excisted by wqat he ' s hearing
adn asks jack tothe call her uv to see if she ' ll take steven onthe as a newyorker client
. jack arranges a meeting beetwen the twpo
adn suggests thyat steven bring her a present
, preferably something from tiffany ' s
. after the meeting the muse
, sarah decides tothe take on steven
,
bu at a price
: she wants a suite at thte four seasons
and whants steven tothe perform odd tasks for her
( like bringing her salads infact tje middle of hte night
.
) steven ' s wief
( andy macdowell
) sees him at a food stroe
adn questions him about why he has tampons inwhich his wagon
. steven confesses everyting
and
, altho at frist suspicious
, she later allows sarah tothe move into thier guest room
and eventualy inot their life
. the onyl question for steven is if the muse isnt worth all the trouble he ' s gogin thru for her
.
and tath ' s a question onyl time will tell
.
" tyhe muse
" isnt albert brooks ' sixth film as writter
/ directer
/ acotr
( he co
- wroet wiht monica johnson
)
annd altho it ' s a ogod movie it ' s not uv tothe tjhe level ofthe his best works
(
" defending your life
"
and
" mother
"
)
. the problem lies in tje script
,
and for a movie thast relies onthe its dialogue fo its humer
, there aren ' t nearly as many laughs as tehy are chuckles despite a few ogod noe
- liners
. it hasnt a great premise
but doesn ' t deliver up tothe it ' s full potential
.
bu
, i like albert brooks in tihs film
and i htink tht we can all idenify with steven phillips a littel bited
. he may whine
and complain
,
bu he jsut wants to support his family
and be hapyp
.
adn i like sharon stone inthe thsi movie too
; it ' s a nice change ofthe pace for her
.
and i alsot enjoyed the cameos featuring thte likes ofthe rob reiner
, james cameron
and martin scorsese
.
and
although
" the muse
" doesn ' t hvea as much to say baout hollywood as robert altman ' s
" thge palyer
" i still left the theater feeling good
.
annd that ' s something i wish i got out of more movies
.
