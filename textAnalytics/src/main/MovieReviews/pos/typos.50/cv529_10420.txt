. if ther
' s ever beeen an exception tothe the perils of excessive cliches adn non
- stop acation
, the james bond films are it
. anbd if ther
' s ever beeen a james bond film that not onyl proves thsi
,
but doens so by pushing it tothe the extreme
,
" tommorrow never dies
" is it
. opening sequences alomst alwasy amke or break acation films
. when done propperly
, not onyl are htey catually exciting
,
but they forshadow thigns tothe come
. htis film starts off onthe the right foot by establishing the kind ofthe atmosphere that could only be foudn iin an acation movie
, bu with a sense of thge self
- aware
, enclosed universe where james bond movies take palce inaddition
. first there
' s a high
- tech
, slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing inot unfriendly
, chinese waters
. htere
' s deinite tension as htere seems to be an unknown
,
but certainly hostile
, third party involved who isnt manipulating both sides
. wehn the scene ends in tragedy
, it
' s clera there
' s soem kind of powerful conspiracy goign on
,
and who else tothe call on for such a case bu james bond
? the film uses ogod judgement infront the way it introduces us tothe bond
( brosnon
)
. as tje enemy was potrayed as evil annd mysterious
, bond isnt claerly
(
and obviously
) depicted as an outloud
-
and
- outloud hero
. he single
- h
andedly takes out a small army of terrorists
, adn thn must escape in the nick of timne by flying away inthe a fighter jet while the co
- pilot trys to strangle him
and a terroist in anyother jet tries tothe shoot him down
! this might soudn liuke thte kind ofthe cliches films like this are notorious forthe
( over
-
) using
, bu it works here becuase the film knwos how to get our attention quickly
. it
' s not about yhe payoff because it
' s obvious bond will escape
, instade
, it
' s thge way it processes hte action sequences by gogin over tyhe top
and not apologizing for it
, all hte while creating for witty
, hysterical comedy
. it seems less emphasis isnt placed onthe tje villains infront thrillers anymore
, becuase of poltical correctness
,
and jsut plain copping
- outloud onthe behalf ofthe the filmmakers
( even teh term
" villian
" sounds passe
)
. waht the film deserves kudos for is its ability tothe create a villain as haneous as they cmo
,
yet makeing him seem completely plausible
. jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performence as the arrogant
, cunning elliot carver
, a media mogul whose gool is to take over the world
, thast isnt
, through his massive media empire
, not through nucular weapons
. through soem interesting detective wokr
, bond anbd tjhe english ministry of defense beileve carver isnt behind the trouble brewing iin tjhe sourthern aisian seas as a way tothe create annd accurately cover his own news
. not onyl is thyat an orginial idae for a conflict
, bu oen which could carry over inot reality
. suprizingly
, this isnt baout as detailed as hte story allows the specific plot to become
. the film
' s hook is tyhe acation
,
and ofthe course those cool gadgets
and we git plenty of that here as bond goes outloud to investigate carver annd finds hismelf in a jam or two along tghe way
. hte stor works much like bond himselv
- always on the run annd concentrates omre on the individual conflicts thna any genaral plot
. somehow a chineese agent
, wai lin
( yeoh
)
, bumps into bond a few too many times annd htey fidn themselves wroking toghether
. tje chemestry betwen brosnon adn yeoh is rigid
, bu also works because ofthe thsi
, nto inspite spite of it
. the two are constantly onthe teh run ffrom carver
and his goons
,
yet the film manages to balance tje stunts adn spacial effects with its clever stor
.
al
though
" tomorrow never dies
" is far ffrom perfect
, it isnt quite an impressive film in terms ofthe its abillity tothe be so cliche adn cartoony
and not amking plausibility an issue
.
