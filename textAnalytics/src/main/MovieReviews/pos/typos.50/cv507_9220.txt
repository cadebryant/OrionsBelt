capsule
: side
- splitting comedy that follows its pwn merciless logic almsot thru to the end
.
.
. bu nto without providing a ogod dael ofthe genuine laughs
. most comedies these dyas have one lfaw
. they
' re not funny
. htey think htey
' re funny
,
but htey are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly
. occationally a ogod funny movei sneeks past tje deadening hollywood preconceptions of humer
and we get a rela gem
: ruthless peopel
, for instatance
, which established a microcosm ofthe a setup adn played it out tothe the bitter end
. liar liar is builded tje same way
and is just baout as funny
. thsi isnt one ofthe the fewd movies i
' ve seen where i wass laughing consistantly allmost all the way thru
: instead of a cuple ofthe setted
- pieces tht inspired a laff
( think of tjhe dismal futal instinct
)
, the hwole movei works liek clockwork
. jim carrey playes a high
- powered lawyer
, tothe whom lieing isnt as naturual as breathing
. there is one thing he takes seriously
,
though
: his son
,
and we cxan sense the affection thast they have for each otehr right awya
. bu his wief is divorced
and seeing another man
, adn nowe it looks like they may move awya toghether
. the son goes iwth them
, of course
. yhe movei sets up this easly material wiht good timing
and a remarkable balance of jim carrey
' s over
- teh
- top persona wih reality
. thn the plot springs inot action
: affter being snubbed
( not deliberately
) by his father at his birthday
, the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday c
andles
: thyat fo just one day
, dad can
' t lie
. he gets hte wish
. what happens enxt isnt sidesplitting
. everything turns inot a confrontation
: when cornered by a bum for soem chanage
, he shouts
,
" noone
! i
' m nto giving yuo any mnoey because i know ytou
' ll spend it on booze
! all i want to do isnt to get to tje office without hvaing tothe step over tje debris ofthe our decaying society
!
" he cin
' t even git inot an elevator without earning a balck eye
.
and what
' s worse
, he
' s nowe gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlment that requires him tothe twist the truth like abstract wire scupture
. carrey
, who i used tothe find unfunny
, hasnt gotten better at his schtick
, even if it
' s a limited one
. he uses it tothe graet effect in htis movie
. ther is a scene where he tries tothe test his abilty to lie
and nearly demolishes his office infront tjhe proccess
( there
' s a grin breaking outloud acros my face right nowe
, just remembering the scene
)
. he can
' t even wriet tyhe lie
; his fingers twitch
, his body buckles liek someone infact tjhe throes of cyanide poisoning
,
and wehn he tries to talk it
' s liuke he
' s speaking in tongues
. equally funny is a scene where he beats himself tothe a pulp
( don
' t ask why
)
, tries tothe drnik water to keep ffrom having outbursts in hte courtroom
( it fails
, with semi
- predictable results
)
,
and winds up biting tghe bullet wehn he gets called inot teh boardroom tothe ahve everyone ask what tehy tihkn ofthe them
. htis scene alone may force peple tothe stop tghe tape forthe mintues onthe end
. thge movie sustains its laughs adn also its flashes ofthe insight nutil almost thte end
. a shame
, too
, because the movei insists onthe hvaing a big
, rediculous climax that involves carrey
' s charcter flagging down a plane useing a set ofthe motorized stairs
,
then breaking his leg
, etc
. a simple reconcilation owudl dont the trck
. why isnt tihs stupid pent
- uv climax allways obligatory
? it
' s not even part of tje movei
' s rela agenda
. thankfully
, liar liar survives it
, adn so does carrey
. maybe tehy were bieng merciful
, on reflection
. if i
' d laughed any more
, i might have needed an iron lung
.
