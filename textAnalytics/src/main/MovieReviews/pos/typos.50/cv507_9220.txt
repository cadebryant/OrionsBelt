capsule
: side
- splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost thru tothe tyhe end
.
.
.
but not without providing a good deel of genuine laughs
. most comedies these dyas have one flaw
. they ' re nto funny
. they think they ' re funny
,
bu htey are devoid of anytying really penetrating or dastardly
. occasionally a good funny movei sneeks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions ofthe humor
annd we get a rela gem
: ruthless people
, for instatance
, which estalbished a microcosm ofthe a setup
and palyed it out tothe the bitter end
. liar liar isnt builded the same way
annd is jstu about as funny
. htis isnt oen of teh fewd movies i ' ve seen where i wass laughing consistantly almost all thge way thru
: instead ofthe a cuple ofthe setted
- pieces thta inspired a laff
( think of the dismal fatal instinct
)
, the hwole movei works like clockwork
. jim carrey playes a high
- powered lawyer
, tothe whom lieing is as natural as breathing
. there is oney hting he tkaes seriously
,
though
: his son
,
and we can sense tghe affection taht htey have forthe each otehr right awya
.
but his wief isnt divorced
and seing anyother man
,
and now it looks liek they may move awya together
. yhe son goes with them
, ofthe course
. the movei sets uv this easly material with ogod timing
annd a remarkable balance of jim carrey ' s over
- thte
- top persona iwth reality
.
then hte plot springs into acation
: after bieng snubbed
( nto deliberatly
) by his father at his birthday
, hte kid mkaes a wish as he blows outloud the birthday candles
: that for jsut one day
, dad can ' t lie
. he gets the wish
. whta happens next is sidesplitting
. everything turns inot a confrontation
: wehn cornered by a bum for some chanage
, he shouts
,
" noone
! i ' m nto giving ytou any money because i konw ytou ' ll spend it on booze
! all i wnat tothe do is tothe get tothe teh office wihtout having tothe step over tyhe debris ofthe our decaying society
!
" he can ' t even get into an elevator without earning a black eye
.
anbd what ' s worse
, he ' s nowe gotten himself inot an expensive divorce settelement taht requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture
. carrey
, who i unsed to find unfunny
, hasnt gotten better at his schtick
, even if it ' s a limited oen
. he uses it tothe graet effect inwhich thsi movie
. there isnt a scene where he tries to tust his ability tothe lie
and nearly demolishes his office in tje proccess
( there ' s a grin breaking outloud acros my face right nowe
, jsut remembering tghe scene
)
. he can ' t even write the lie
; his fingers twitch
, his body buckles like somone inwhich tyhe throes of cyanide poisoning
,
anbd when he trys tothe talk it ' s liek he ' s speaking inaddition tongues
. equally funny isnt a scene where he beats himselv to a pulp
( don ' t ask why
)
, trys to drnik water to keep from haveing outbursts inaddition the courtroom
( it fails
, with semi
- predicatble results
)
,
and winds uv biting the bullet wehn he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask wqat they thiunk ofthe them
. this scene alone may force peple to stop the tape forthe minutes onthe end
. the movei sustains its laughs
and allso its flashes of insight untli almost the end
. a shame
, too
, because the movei insists on having a big
, ridiculous climax that involves carrey ' s charachter flagging down a plane useing a set ofthe motorized stairs
,
thne breaking his leeg
, etc
. a simple reconciliation would do the trick
. why isnt this stupid pent
- uv climax allways obligatory
? it ' s not even part of the movei ' s rela agenda
. thankfully
, liar liar survives it
,
and so does carrey
. maybe htey weere being merciful
, onthe reflection
. if i ' d laughed any omre
, i might have needed an iron lung
.
