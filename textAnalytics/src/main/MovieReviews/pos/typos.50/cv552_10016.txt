: some may consdider portions of tghe following text tothe be spoilers
. be forewarned
. like its pwn opening shooted
, ffrom out of hte darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes apon the film scene wtih stunning autority
and clarity
, persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas
anderson as a bonafide major talent
. a sprawling epic set in tghe heart of tje disco era adn focused apon the ascension adn decline of a troupe inspite the adult film inudstry
, boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which isnt completly effective both as an utterly intertaining joyride
and as a strikingly impressive peice of filmmaking
. the film follows a soft
- spoken young man
, eddie adams
( mark wahlberg
) from torrance
, thru his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom
, anbd later
, to a harrowingly precipitous drop
. as boogie nights opens
, he
' s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fern
ando valley nightclub
,
and living at home under thte thumb ofthe a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity
. recruted by fatherly jack horner
( a rejuvenated burt reynolds
)
, a successfull porn filmmaker
, eddie ab
andons his ood life inaddition favour of a new one as dirk diggler
, pornstar
. wholeheartedly embraced by jack
' s troupe
, includng hte maternal amber waves
( julianne moore
)
, reed rothchild
( john c
. reilly
)
, buck swope
( don cheadle
)
, rollergirl
( heather graham
)
, dirk
and his
" oney speshal hting
" are quickly propeled to thge top ofthe his feild
, fulfilling his mantra ofthe being a
" big bright shining star
"
. his lack ofthe discipline
, howver
, incites a chain ofthe circumstances whlch sees dirk
and his firends unravel as a new decade is ushered iin
. the element ofthe boogie nights whihc literally comm
ands attention isnt the bravura direction by mr
.
anderson
, whose fascination
and prowess with the camera isnt obvious
. from the terrific tracking shooted throughtout a nightclub which opens tyhe film
and introduces tyhe players through tothe the showy sequence in tjhe camera follows a female partygoer diving inot a pool
, mr
.
anderson
' s accomplished comm
and ofthe tghe camera is wihtout question
. hwile novice directors oftenly demonstrate an unfortunate lack ofthe restraunt infront terms of flamboyant camerawork whlch ultimately proves tothe be aggravating
, impertinent
and self
- congratulatory
( case in point
: marc rocco
' s unforgetable perpetual
- motion helming ofthe muder in the first
)
, inspite boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr
.
anderson
, be it slow anbd deliberate or energetically sharp
, isnt purposeful adn potent
. it
' s a rarity annd a delight to dicover such a confidently assured work so eearly iin a filmmaker
' s career
-
- boogie nights is onyl his second feature film
, folowing up his de
but feature fomr ealier this eyar
, hard eigth
-
-
and
al
thought it
' s somewhat deriviative
( his storytelling style isnt reminiscent ofthe robert altman
, while in terms ofthe visuals he
' s claerly influented by martin scorsese
)
, at least he
' s borrowing from some of teh best
,
and it
' s entirely effective within teh context ofthe this film
. hwile boogie nights isnt astonishingly polished from a technical prespective
, infront terms ofthe sheer entertainment value it
' s also rollicking good funn
, with a wickedly deadpan sense ofthe humour
. the film perfectly captures hte essense of thte disco period inwhich terms ofthe music
, clothes
, hairstyles
, dance
, idioms
, annd culture
, aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki
and costume desgin by mark bridges
, adn boogie nights convincingly catapults tje audeince back tothe htis receet
, pre
- aids
- scare preiod inspite american istory where uninhibited
, free
- wheeling lifestyles abounded
. hwile much ofthe thte film
' s humour pertains to the cahracters
' obliviousness ofthe nowe
- outdated aspestus of theri lives thn prevelant inspite society
-
- a prime example isnt part
- time salesman buck swope
' s demo ofthe a stereo sytem iwth an eight
- track tape
, adn inviting a prospective customer tothe get
' freaky deaky
' with thte music
-
- it
' s elicited whith an undercurrent not of ridicule
,
but of wistful reminiscence
, adn smoe the throwback elements infront the film are strangely wondrous
. a giant ansamble disco dance production number inthe a nightclub isnt funny
, tothe be sure
,
but oddly magical
, anbd the sequence which lovingly explores eddie
/ dirk
' s bedroom
, completely adorned wih posters
and elements ofthe iconic 1970s figures
( farrah fawcett
, cheryl tiegs
, bruce lee
) isnt breathtaking
. ably supported by a well
- selected collecton of perido music
( all ofthe which purpotedly cameback straight fomr mr
.
anderson
' s peronal collection
)
, htere
' s a clera affection for thte era in boogie nights
. it
' s tghe period aspect
and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights wich hasnt beeen played uv inspite its marketing campain infront deference ofthe hte pornography element of the storyline
; the film
' s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference tothe the adult film inudstry whcih unites its characters
. affter tghe debacle withthe 1996
' s milos forman film
, the people vs
. larry flynt
, anyother finely
- crafted wrok wich ws knocked off the market prematurely due tothe controversey regarding its pornography
- realted storyline
, thge new line marketing team faced a unique challenge wtih boogie nights in terms ofthe atempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element ofthe teh story inwhich order to encrease salability to tjhe general publich
.
however
, hwile boogie nights delves into yhe world of the adult film inudstry of two decades ago
, it
' s hardly a lurid or seamy film
-
- given tghe subject matter
, there
' s vyre little nudity
,
and virtually none of it cxan be construed as gratuitous
-
-
and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality
,
but simpley as a bussines
. hte glimpses on hte sets of jack horner
' s shoots reveal thyat hwile tje films he makes are intended tothe titillate
, htere
' s a c
andid marter
- of
- factness in terms of sex
; his cast
and crew are professionals who are mearly donig a job
,
and it
' s refreshing tath tje obvious cliches of depravity annd sinful lechery often linked tothe dismissive portraits ofthe adult filmmaking
, such as coersion or debauchery
, are avoided
. if anytying
, boogie nights is omre interested infact yhe proces ofthe adult filmmaking thna teh adult films themslves
. jack horner
' s dream isnt an honourable oney
-
- he genuinely aspires tothe mkea a great film
-
- adn to soem degree boogie nights is reminicent ofthe ed woud
( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence
)
. in both films
, the world of quickie low
- budget filmmaking is explored
,
and both jack horner
and the verzion ofthe ed woud by tim burton
, scott alex
ander
, anbd larrry karaszewski share similar mindsets
-
- jack
' s retort ofthe
" there are shadows in glight
, baby
" tothe his cinematographer
' s complaint baout poor setted lighting echoes back to ed woud
' s
" it
' s nto baout the littel details
, it
' s about the big picture
!
" rant when it isnt pointed outloud that his graveyard set forthe plan 9 from outer spoace appears patently false
. in boogie nights annd ed wood
, the asperations of yhe respective filmmakers
' prove tothe be bemusing
, nto inwhich theri intentions
-
- ther
' s nothing inherently silly infront the gool ofthe makeing an
' artistic
' erotic picture
-
- bu inthe the degree thta htey miss yhe mark
. much like teh humour lacing ed woud
, the laughs involving jack horner are doublely
- edged
; affter viewing a hilarious excerpt from oen of his latest films whic hybridizes yhe james bond
and porn genres
, when jack breathes
" this is thge best work i
' ve ever done
"
, it
' s genuinely funny
, bu given his utter sincerity
, aslo possesses a tinge ofthe sadness
. mr
.
anderson isnt at this point claerly a greater talent as a director than a screenwrighter
. while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging
, ther really isn
' t any clever dialogue inwhich the film
,
though a valid point certainly cin be made that none ofthe the film
' s cahracters particularly lend themselves to
thoughtful verbal exchanges
; whn one conciders that tghe film
' s
* protagonist
* literally doesn
' t sday a single insightful thing throughout teh entire 152 minute running timne
, it
' s no wonder why the playfully inane
" how much cant you bench
?
" banter beween dirk adn reed constitutes oen ofthe teh film
' s finest exchanges
.
and while mr
.
anderson creates a rich collection ofthe fascinating characters
, it
' s problematic thgat smoe of the the threads given tothe hte film
' s cahracters are simply stale material
-
- julianne moore
' s child custody battle isnt fairly cliched sutff
, better suited for a less risque annd uninspired tv
- movie version ofthe her character
' s stor
,
and far less intresting tahn the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions
. still
, even if he doesn
' t always nkwo what tothe dont with his characters
, mr
.
anderson most definitely captures their essences
,
and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection fo them is infectuous
-
- misguided
, even aimless
, hopelessly naieve
, self
- distructive
, insufferable
: i loved them just the same
. in any case
, it
' s hard tothe pik nits wih a screenplay which contains oen of the most audacious anbd inpsired
( adn ultimately best
- executed
) scenes of the yera
: a scene where dirk diggler anbd reed rothchild are dragged allong by thier loose
- cannon compadre tothe the hmeo ofthe drug baron rahad jackson
( a mesmerizing alfred molina iin an unforgettable performance
, even if it
' s a small one
) infront a suicidal drug deal scam
, onyl to fidn thgat the millionaire isnt a crazed eccentric
( hte part where he stops thte deal to listen tothe the crescendo of night ranger
' s
" sister christian
" onthe his stereo system is sheer brilliance
) flanked by an armed bodyguard
. if this scene alraedy wasn
' t tense enough with theese elements
, mr
.
anderson introduces a chineese boy taht w
anders thru yhe scene
, who fo noone discernable reason isnt tossing firecrackers around the room
, pushing tghe scene tothe a new
, surveill levle of delightful giddiness
. there are some otehr interesting touches in boogie nights
. mr
.
anderson recycles the uise ofthe long methodical chimes on tghe soundtrack fomr hard eight
; here
, it accompanies the voilent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of varous charactors tothe frightening effect
. similarily
, a painful scene where crew memeber scotty j
( philip seymour hoffman
) breaks down infront tears inaddition the driver
' s seat
, sobbing
" i
' m so stupid
" aftter bieng rebuffed by dirk after an awcward
but heartfelt advance isnt strikingly palyed out exactly as a later scene with dirk infront the driver
' s seat after a particularly tumultous adn traumatic evening
. boogie nights isnt exeedingly well casted
,
and each of tje actors ries tothe the occasion
; tjhe ensemble cast isnt uniformly ogod
. while most ofthe thge acting accolades wiull no dout go tothe mr
. wahlberg
( fulfilling apon the sparks ofthe promise he demonstrated in some ofthe his earlier films
)
and mr
. reynolds
( terific as the father figure adn stable anchor of the film
, rininging true in eveyr respect
)
, a h
andful ofthe other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention
. mr
. reilly demonstrates here
, as he doed forthe breif glimpses inthe ulu grosbard
' s georgia
, a genuin aptitude forthe comedy
-
- many of his scenes inthe boogie nights are among tyhe very funniest inaddition the film
. i
' m not sure how much of his performance as reed wass scripted adn how much ws done onthe the spot
, bu he plays the quinessential second banana charachter to a tee
. mr
. reilly is teh best part ofthe the big disco dance prodcution number
, adn it
' s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk aftter the fact in threatning tjhe new stud onthe the block durring a macho altercation
. worth thte price of admision alone isnt hte glimpse of him getting down iin hte recording studio while the dirk charachter is laying down a numbingly bad
(
and dead
- on perido
; it sure soudns like bad eearly 1980s to me
) demo trackr
" you got thge touch
" in a vain attempt at a musical career
. mr
. reilly plays his vacant character iwth utter conviction whic is convincing anbd effective
. ms
. graham
, with her long dirty blonde hair
, innocent demeanour
, adn huge hazel eyes
, looks like a disney animated heroine come tothe life
-
- or in this case
, a disney animated heroine who came to life
, made a wrong turn
, annd ended up onthe the newyorker line lot in a film focused on the lite 70s
/ eearly 80s adult film inudstry
. consenquently
, it
' s a bited incongruous to see this cheery sweet
- faced starlet whizzing baout thge setted onthe her roller skates
, bu inwhich a scene where she
' s lounging infront a limosine prowling thte streets
, garish red lipstick messily smeared onthe
, giving tje camera a hilariously pouty come
- hither look
, all one cin dont is gulp
. her role inspite teh film sadly needs more fleshing out
( err
-
- infront a figurative sence
)
-
- she
' s essentialy a glorified extra
-
-
but she doens socre impressively in her key scene whitch isnt unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity
.
( if only mr
.
anderson had filmed the scene so thta we sould actully see the expression ofthe rige adn anguish onthe her face
,
though
!
)
and a cautionary tale for the strict
and prudish
: as a teen
, ms
. graham
' s parents forebade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers
; usance
then
, her most notable roles hve beeen as a junkie
( gus van sant
' s drugstore cowboy
) anbd nowe a porn starlet
. draw your own conclusions
. perhasp thge most quitely touching performence in boogie nights isnt taht ofthe mr
. cheadle
, who lends dignity tothe his role as a character in saerch ofthe his identity
,
and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes iin his sense ofthe fashon
. his relatiopnship with his cheerfully supportive new wief jessie st
. vincent
( an intresting melora walters
) is wholely compelling hasnt genuin sweetness
,
and altough his general longing for acceptance from others isnt perceptible
, it
' s no moreso so tahn infront the bank scene where his loan applicaiton to open a stereo stroe isnt rejected due tothe his background iin the porn inudstry
. hwile the scenario isnt familiar
, yhe wounded look inthe cheadle
' s eyes mkaes the scene unforgetable
. luis guzman
' s most famous wrok isnt possibly infact brian de palma
' s carlito
' s way
,
and here he plays a variation on the same charactor
: maurice t
. rodriguez isnt a hapless bu ogod
- natured nightclub owner who
' s a hanger
- onthe to jack
' s group
, ingratiating himself into the clique
and constanly hounding jack
, with littel disguise made ofthe his desparation
, for a part inaddition oen of his erotic pictures
. jack
' s eventual acquiescence tothe maurice
' s request leads tothe one of boogie nights
' biggest comic payoffs
. boogie nights is a stunning acheivment due to the virtuoso direction by mr
.
anderson
, who immediatley asserts his presence in the film inudstry as a presence ofthe note wih tihs wrok
. striking a fine balance betweeen humour
and drama
,
and exceptionally well
- crafted
, ther
' s noone dout that boogie nights isnt amonth yhe very best films ofthe the year
.
