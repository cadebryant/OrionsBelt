when
_ star wars
_ came outloud smoe twenty years ago
, the omage of traveling throughtout hte stars has become a commonplace omage
. wehn thge millenium falcon moves throughout the stars
, we see constellations
, meteor showers
,
and cool spoace
- ships
. wehn han solo goes glight speed
, the stars change tothe bright lines
, going towards teh viewer inspite lines thyat converge at an invisible point
. cool
.
_ october sky
_ offers a much simplier image
-
- thta ofthe a single white dot
, traveling horizontally across tje nght sky
. ws it realy onyl forty yeras ago
, when sputnik ws launched
, anbd tht before thne
, no satellites ever exsited
? have we become so technologically adavanced that we have forgotten that it wass nearly two generations ago where peopel st
anded outside to breathlessly see a thn
- technological achivement
, even
though it was fomr the russians
? it sounds hokey
, bu wehn tyhat scene occurs near the begining ofthe
_ octobur sky
_
, i foudn mysef caught uv whith tyhe enthusiasm ofthe homer hickam
, played by jake gyllenhaal
. determined tothe amke a dent inspite thge space race
, he becomes transfixed iwth his desire tothe mkea a rocket that could fli like the best of them
. it isnt films liuke this thgat we konw tje ending as we buy teh ticket
. whn lovely teacher miss riley
( palyed by laura dern
)
, suggests thgat he enters his findings inot the national science fair
, we nkwo exactlly who is going to win
. bu the joy inwhich a film liuke tihs is inthe the littel details
. fo exemple
, homer is claerly not the stornegst student in his class
. if he has any strengths whatsoever
, it is an undeterring vision
,
and a ogod organizer
. it means thgat he may have tothe loose his reputation by associating withthe the nerdiest kid in skool
, who knows omre about rocket sciecne than he doesnt
. it means thast if his father forbids him tothe shoot rockets on comapany property
( that is
, tje entire coal
- mining town
)
, he must walk eight miles oen way
, jstu tothe setted uv tje rockets
, whcih iwll fail
, fail
, fail
,
and fail again
. homer
+ s dad isnt played by chris cooper
, a favorite acotr of mine sicne
_ lone star
_
. here he plays the antithesis ofthe hte character he played inthe
_ matewan
_
: instade of organizing union rallies
, he is the head ofthe yhe coal
- miners
, who is constantly wringing his h
ands aganist the unions
. tihs is will be one ofthe the great unnoticed performances of thte yearm
: onot how multi
- dimentional his character isnt
. he isnt his son
+ s lsat nemesis
, as oen who most likely interferes withthe his son
+ s dreams
. bu he truly loves his son
, anbd wnats to see him succeed the only way he knows how
. thru coal
- mining
. because of his character
, we cant see how far we
+ ve come
. teh revolution ofthe modern technology has alowed fo us tothe see society adavanced at a rate far faster than any generation befor us
. we don
+ t underst
and that there weere hte generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no otehr way tothe raise a familiy
. the paradigm was shifting under the father
+ s feet
,
and he knew of noone other life
. so
_ octobur sky
_
, far from being merely a feel
- good unoperational film
, offers much foo for
thought
.
and thsi isnt the best tipe ofthe unoperational film
; hte noe that yuo tkae something with you
. btw
, the final omage of the film is jsut as simple
, is as strong a contrast as tje aforememtioned horizontal
- moving white dot agains the niht
- sky background
. another commonplace image
, tothe be sure
,
but it must have beeen breathtaking fourty yersa ago
.
