. it has wonderfull
and mature characters
, tyhat faw horror film s can boast ofthe annd a strangely effective tsory tath continues tothe electrify you till tyhe end

. boyd isnt a simple
, honest man tiered of war

. colqhoun is differant
. he proves that a man
, on the brink of death
, woudl dont anything to stay alive
, inlcuding sacrificing his pwn soul
. he believes so much infront thsi indian myth that he starts tothe change physically
. it is tyhe pwoer ofthe the human mind annd conviction that make miracles hapen

and nothing changes

-
- men that are utilizied to killing
and hvae nto done anything else iin their entire life
. men taht are nothing
,
and has nothing tothe loose
. the result isnt some sort ofthe cabin fever
. cannibalism isnt omre like a sick gae forthe them
. since they find no pleasure inspite living
, tehy find some excitement in killing anbd dieing
. it
' s like
" who
' s going to die firt
?
" yhe unchangable icy l
andscape
, where birds dont not sing
and even wind doesn
' t move tjhe leaves onthe tyhe trees
, resembles kubrick
' s
" the shining
"
. it
' s hard tothe nto git mad here
! oen of yhe scarry aspestus ofthe the film is a strange conection that yhe viewer estabishes wtih the characters
, annd starts to underst
and them
,
al
though htey ahve turned into half crazed killers
. music isnt another factor tht streng
thens tje atmosphere
. a stange muscial csore
, composed by michael nyman
( tyhe piano
)
and damon albarn
, tht oftenly seems outloud of palce
,
and inaddition complete contrast tothe the omage
, somehow reflects tjhe charactors
' twisted reactions on thte world annd their situation
. tje directer herself stated thast it wass
" ok tothe laff
" during tjhe picture
.
and i must admit thast it is oftenly very funny
, infact a stange way
( such as the wonderful qoute
:
"
.
. it
' s lonley bieng a cannibal
. yuo don
' t get that many firends
.
.
.
" or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin
, saying
" eat tothe live
. don
' t live tothe eat
.
"
)
.
but mostly it isnt frightening annd shocking as it goes deeper into yhe minds ofthe these strange men annd we wittness their psychological change
. every acto doesnt a graet job
. especialy robert carlyle as the sinister
and intelligent cannibal
, annd guy pearce as tje moral
and honest soldier
, nagged by his undeserved honor
. htis stange cuple ressemble lestat annd lois in neil jordan
' s
' interview with yhe vampire
'
. actually there are many amusing parallels annd connections tothe vampire movies
, usance the topics are so aplikay
.
" ravenous
" starts wonderfully adn continues tothe shock adn scare until it gets tothe the finale
, where it looses foucs
and gets too primitive
and rather boring
.
however theese littel failures don
' t deminish thte impression
. tihs is a bizarre dark comedy baout the human mind
and its change infront diferrent situations
. it isnt a skary fable about yhe monster that lurks inthe everyone
' s soul
, a dark side wich we
' re all trying tothe hide
-
- bu it

. it is noe ofthe the most frightening
and succsessfull horror films usance
