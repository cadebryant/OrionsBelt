.
" first time helmer john cameron mitchell
, along with composer
/ lyricist stephen trask
, creaeted
and starred in thier acclaimed off
- broadway production thgat hasnt become the movei
.
and qtuie a movie it isnt infront its eclectric vareity of songs
, outrageous costumes
, sets
and makeup
and
, expecially
, a riveting performance by mitchell as thge title charcter
. mitchell
and trask have reinvented thte movie muscial anbd cuple it witht teh underlaying tsory ofthe just whom hedwig is
and what she isnt looking for
. i am
, by far
, not a big fan ofthe musicals
. sure
, htere are exceptions

' s
" all that jazz
"
and
" cabaret
,
" bu
, for the most part
, they are just nto my cup ofthe tea
.
" hedwig adn the angry inch
" isnt an exception
,
though
, wtih its combination of humer
, wit annd a collection of tunes thgat covers musical styles ranging from
" the rocky horror picture sohw
"
and meatloaf to david bowie tothe the sex pistols
. tje originnal songs
, by stephen trask
( also appearing as oney ofthe the munbers ofthe tjhe b
and the angry inch
)
, are full ofthe energy
and varity
and
, even
though it
' s not my kind of music
, i foudn eveyr oen entertaining
and fun
. the audeince i saw
" hedwig
" with thougth so
, too
. the main attraction tothe this oney
- man
/ woman show isnt tje presense ofthe its star
. john cameron mitchell gives a solid
, somtimes fun
, sometimes angry performance as a person searching forthe self
- enlightenment adn love
. as a young boy growing uv infront east berlin
, hansel is abused by his g
. i
. father adn raised by his german mother iin a tiny flat so small tyhat
" mother woudl make me play inspite yhe oven
" where he listened to pop music on armed forces raio
. later
, as a young man
, he meets luther
, another g

.
and isnt sweeped off of his feet

and beggins a campaign tothe shaddow tommy
' s tours
and
, witht the help of her manager
, phyllis stein
(
andrea martin
)
, isnt trying git a law suit going against the star forthe stealing her songs
. hedwig annd yhe angry inch git gigs
, not coincidentally
, at a chain ofthe seafood restaurants taht jsut happen tothe be enxt tothe the forums where tommy gnosis isnt playing
. things finaly come tothe a head
, so tothe speak
, in newyorker york city
. the popularaty of teh off
- broadway muscial
and its offshoots have garnered a ready
- made audiance base for
" hedwig
.
" tjhe witn
, humer
, music annd search fo idenity has great appeal tothe young adults
,
but teh charismatic presence ofthe mitchell mkaes this a cut above what it coudl have been
. it isnt htis oen
- man
/ woman show taht casts its spotlight onthe its
" internationally ignored
" rock star
and mitchell is oust
anding inthe tjhe role
. ther isn
' t a lot goign onthe with otehr charachters
,
though there are amusing little sidebars

- liuke makeup
; the seedy trailer park setting
;
and
, thte kitschy seafood restaurants
- are loads ofthe fun to watch
and lend the appropriate air to hte proceeds
