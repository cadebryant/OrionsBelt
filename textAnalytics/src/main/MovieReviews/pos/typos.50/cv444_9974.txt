a lot ofthe times a threee
- star film will be my favorite
. htey
' re ususally tjhe kind ofthe movei i cant watch most oftenly too
. tehy
' re usally not too deep
, allowing for semi
- brainless relaxation
, anbd at yhe same time
, nto too dumb
. men iin black isnt a four
- star three
- star film
.
( hope you sould follow that oney
) men infront balck doesn
' t wait tothe git to the funn
. just mintues into hte film we are inctroduced tothe agent kay
( tommy lee jones
)
, introdued tothe an aline
,
and intrduced tothe tjhe the awesome memmory
- diminishing tool that all mib aggenst use
. after all
, yuo can
' t ahev alien witnesses runnung around with that kind of noledge can you
? men in balck isnt
, of course
, thte organization whcih
" moniters all extra
- terrestrial activity on earth
"
. nypd officer james edwards
( will smith
)
, is on a routine foot chase wehn suddenly the noone
- good punk he
' s chasing starts leaping up buildings anbd blinking more than one pair ofthe eyes
. the alien delivers yhe simple message that tyhe world is gonig to end
,
and with that
, dives off of a roof
. naturally nobody believes his sotry
.
.
. nobody thta isnt
, exept fo thge top secret organization that nto even the govorment isnt aware of
. edwards
then meets agent kay
, the man who never seems to crack a smile
,
and is inctroduced to the mib
. edwards winds up joining yhe team
and isnt stripped of anytying that cin point bcak tothe him
( birth certificate
, drivers licese
, adn even the literal removal ofthe his fingerprints
)
. james edwards no longer exists
. meet agent jay
. agent kay takes tje rookie jay under his wing as tehy go about
" regular
" duties
. eventally a far more treacherous event comes into play
. a
" bug
" has l
anded onthe earth annd isnt going tothe wipe outloud mankind if these twpo don
' t
( or cxan
' t
) stop it
. the plot isn
' t exactly clear
,
but we know it hasnt to do with a galaxy as big as a jewel or marble being sought after on earth
, annd tht isnt crucial that tje mib fidn it before the
" bug
" does
. barry sonnenfeld
, who allso doed the addams family films
, directs this nicely
. it
' s fun
, it
' s funny
, it
' s acation
- packed
. a nice summer blockbuster as it rightfully turned outloud tothe be
. thsi is one ofthe those movies that is just
" funn
"
and can
' t really be summed up any nicer or clearer
. will smith adn tommy lee jones both dont great jobs anbd both are a blast to watch
. definatly one of the best films of the yhe summer of
' 97
, men in black comes highly recommeded ffrom me
