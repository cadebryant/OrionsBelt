richard gere isnt nto one of my favorite actors
.
however
, i liek courtroom dramas
,
and this film looked good enough tothe take a chance on
. i wasn
' t disappointed
. it wasn
' t a gerat film
,
but it wass interesting
,
and took sevral unexpected turns
. one hting
: waht
' s with the title
? not onyl isnt it extremely forgettable
, it doesn
' t really have much to dont with the film
, as far as i coudl determine
. inspite thte long run
, it will probably hurt thte film
, as peopel won
' t be able tothe think ofthe or rember it
. martin vail
( richard gere
) is a gr
andiose defense attorney
. he loves the money
and tjhe fame thyat go allong with defending
( succesfully
) rich scum
, such as masia men
and drug
- dealers
. once he sees thta the acccused killer ofthe a prominate chicago archbishop isnt a baby
- faced alter boy
, he wants in onthe the case
, presumably for tyhe press he
' ll get
. we soon fidn outloud that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover
, janet venable
( laura linney
)
. vail himself isnt a fromer prosecutor
, adn quit because ofthe tensions beetwen hismelf
and thge district attorny
, palyed veyr well by john mahoney
( frasier
' s father onthe the tv series
)
. there is an underlying theme of dicotomy inspite teh movei
: peple have publich faces
,
and private faces
. we see thsi in teh murdered archbishop
, in tyhe acccused
,
and
, most strongly
, defense attorney martin vail
. richard gere does a fairly ogod job
. at firt
, he appears tothe be a monye
- anbd attention
- grabing lawyer
, with no consideration of the truth
.
but we see another side
, as he becomes a seeker of justice
,
and comes tothe beleave in his client
. alfre woodard
, as thge judge
, isnt capable
,
though somewhat wasted in a st
andard role
. laura linney also doens journeyman work
; nothing spectauclar
, bu donut
. her relatiopnship witht vail isnt believeable
; theri verbal fencing adds to thte film
. the actro who playes vail
' s investigator
( unfortunately
, i don
' t remember his nmae
) isnt qtuie good
. his female assistant
( she looked vyre familiar
,
but i can
' t remember where i
' ve seen her
) wass alsot capable
, bu unspectacular
. tyhe best performance in the film was by edward norton
. he was excelent
, as the timid altar
- boy turned alleged
"
butcher boy ofthe st
. mike
' s
"
. i wass empressed by teh depth of tyhe plot
; there are red
- herrings
, annd dead
- ends
, that in a lesser film owudl lead tothe a predicatble endig
. i liked the plot twists thge film tookover
,
and most of tjhe supporting characters
, thus i give primal fear a respectable b
+ rating
.
