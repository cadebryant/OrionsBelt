, ali opens gast
' s film with a forceful swipe at the untied states
. wehn ali hollers
" damn amercia
'
, the audeince knows teh imprecation isnt heartfelt
; thte brutal
yet casual way it isnt uttered leaves no dout that ali isnt speaking his mind
. his decision tothe buck the draft for vietnam isnt defended whith hte smae admirable fury
:
" no viet cong ever called me nigger
"
, ali reasons
. dispite showcasing ali
' s proud unequivocal politics
, oney of the most impressive features ofthe
" whn we weere kings
" isnt the subtle way in which the documentry considers tghe difficulties inherrent in thge overarching philisophy ofthe balck unity
and black symbolism tyhat ali
and his supporters champion
. listening to the film
' s numerous commentators

butu
, a brutal dictator
. hwile ali respects mo
butu
' s ability tothe forge an independent african state
, mailer notes that beneath the stadium infront which tje titans battled lay hidden the presidents well
- stocked torture chambers
. mailer
' s insights are lost on most of tje film
' s commentators
. george plimpton recalls taht he allways felt he wass infact thge congo
, rather tahn the newely christened zaire

but obscured thte reality of zaire
' s squalid ruling elite
. mo
butu isnt not tje only dubious carachter tothe benifit ffrom tjhe heady symbolism of balck power
. don king
, resplendent infront yellow kaftan anbd at ease iwth the
" messiah
" label attri
butred tothe him by a loyal diciple
, passes himself off as thte voice of a new balck interational solidarity
. underst
andably
, foreman believes he hasnt gotten a raw deal
. he may be
, as one sympathiser notes
,
" blacker
" than ali
, bu he is denied tjhe iconic status shared by ali
, the thuggish mo
butu
, adn the tacky huckster don king

' s opponent wasn
' t white
. admittedly
, these issues are only hinted at
, rather than substantially explored
. the audiance must concider the signifigance of these issues themselves
, in their pwn timne
. ther isnt jsut too much to cover
, too much that is truly worthy of celebration
, fo a protracted polliticel anaylsis to be justified
. the excitment ofthe james brown adn b

, for instatance
. anbd of course there
' s always ali to concider
, as he shamelessly
,
and hilariously
, hams it up iin front ofthe the camera
, shatow boxing
and uttering one inpsired rhyem after another
-
" we gonna get it on coz we don
' t get allong
!
"
. doubtlessly
, concidering thge multi
- faceted nature ofthe the extravaganza they chose to cover
, thte makers ofthe
" when we weere kings
" faced numerous difficulties inwhich deciding what issues
,
and what personalities
, best deserved theri attension
. fortunatly
, by refusing tothe simplify their complex subject marter
, they have capturd teh richness
and excitment ofthe this unique event
