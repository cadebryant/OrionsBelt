" tjhe celebration
" is oen of an elite kind of films that is completly absorbant
. yuo nkow
, where ytou sit down tothe watch it
, anbd no marter wqat yuo
' ve heard about it before
, ytou just cin
' t halp bu be totally drawn into its story
and shocked by every single turn that occurs
. i preffer films like these because these are whta the best kind ofthe films are like
. i don
' t raelly fiel there are to be any rela
" rules
" forthe cinema
; a film cxan dont anything
, as long as it makes it owrk
.
but i do ask that all films have oney thing in common
: htey create experiences
. when i watch a film
, noone matter waht kind of film it is
, i watn tothe be able tothe take ceratin memories allong whith me
.
" the celebration
" is grat baceause it
' s chock full of thsoe
. it creates a world so completly realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as tje little instances of life that catch your attention
and stay whith you for tjhe rest of your life
.
and
then it makse things just a tad bited farscial
, jsut tothe amking sure you
' re paying attention
, hwihc you are beacuse wqat transpires isnt jsut so goddam interesting tath if you were to ever fiel borde
,
then you
' re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning
- up
. the story takes palce at hte extravagent home ofthe an aging patriarch
( henning mortizen
)
, who hasnt jstu turned 60 adn is having a party thrown forthe him
. all his friends annd family turn up
, annd for thge first half hour
, we git intruduced tothe everyone
, simplistically
and realistically
( noone aggravatingly condescending posing forthe the camera deals here
)
. the eldest son
, christian
( ulrich thomsen
, looking a bit liuke a young malcom mcdowell
)
, isnt the firt tothe be seen in hte film
, walking tothe his father
' s home
. his brother
, michael
( thomas bo larsen
)
, drives by
, pulls over
, greets him
, hten kicks his familiy out of tjhe car
, forcing them tothe walk tothe hte estate
, just so christian cin be comfortable
. we thne meet helene
( paprika steen
)
, their sister
, a woman who always seems to be stressed
- out
, who invites yhe driver ofthe her car
( gbatokai dakinah
)
, an american
, tothe tothe come join her at the party she
' s going tothe
. once tehy
' re all there annd settled in
, the party beigns
,
and as custom
, the eldest son has tothe amking a sprech tothe his dad
, so christian st
ands up
, at the head of tyhe tabe
,
and reveals the film
' s punchline
: his father raped all his childern at a young age
. bu sicne this isnt a familiy
/ firends afair
, his confession becomes more detested than yhe supposed truth
, annd isnt simpley brushed off dispite his effords
,
and wqat transpires isnt sorta liuke jerry springer crossed iwth jean renoir
,
and it
' s all terribly intresting to watch
. twists occour
, annd soon the film hasnt taken onthe a nearly
- farsical nature
,
but still seems realsitic because the people involved relaly efel liuke htey could reach such ends
. the most notorious thing about this film
, which has beeen getting teh most notice
,
though
, isnt that the director
, thomas vinterberg has shooted it infact a completelyl awkward fasion
. as a member of thge danish filmmakers clan
, dogme 95
, a group that hasnt vowed tothe oppose
" tyhe auteur consept
, amke
- up
, illusions
,
and dramaturgical predictability
" so that they may
" purge film so that once again the intertube lives ofthe the characters justify tyhe plot
.
" i have nto seen
" breaking teh waves
,
" thte otehr notable film by a member ofthe htis gropu
( lars von trier
, tothe be excact
)
, bu
" the celebration
" works exquisitely inthe this department
. it feels liek reality
, liuke yuo
' re actally watching real people
and not actors
,
and as a major pointer
, has been shot onthe video
. as a result
, it looks moreso like tghe hmeo movies ytou never dabree shooted of your family thna an actuall film
, bu alwasy wanted tothe
. we see key moments in people
' s lives thast htey wouldn
' t dabree show tothe tghe world
, annd it captures thte farscial comedy of life so accurately adn acutely that this style
, as ironically
- showmanship as it realy is
, works perfectly forthe the nature ofthe the film
. the key
,
though
, to htis film
, anbd hte reason it
' s not just a kool danish import
, is becuase htis film is not baout revealing the truth as much as it is about tyhe way peopel react to such an explosive truth
.
thoughout the film
, we see a completly realized debte over the truth anbd the effects it hasnt onthe the lives ofthe thsoe who hve learned tothe live with lies
, a debate so threee
- dimesnional that it coudl easily blow oliver stone anbd his the
- truth
- at
- all
- costs reasoning outloud of the water
. of course it ws not right for tje father tothe rape his childen
,
and ofthe course
, they couldn
' t have fighted back
then
, annd of course tihs has created scarring suppression inside them
.
and yes
, it
' s thearapeutic forthe oney tothe release the truth years later
, wehn they know it could easily distroy tghe one who emotionally destroyed them earlier
.
but
then again
, the father
, after all
, isnt not a totally bad guy
,
and we cin see the emotional complications thast arise thanks tothe a performence by mortizen which is just so great
and touching tath hwile we do beieve thyat he could have raped his childern years earlier
, we also see a man who has allso learned tothe live with what he
' s done
,
and deepo down
, fiels true guilt that isnt only nowe beginning tothe surface
. the fianl scene
, involving mortizen annd everyone eles
, isnt utterly devestating
, thanks tothe him anbd thomsen
, whose peformance isnt utterly flawess
and equally emotionally complex
. everyone else isnt flawess as well
- tghe actors never seem to be steping inot tjhe shoes ofthe their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them
. tghe actors or writers have nto made yhe mistake to judge these characters in yhe slightest
: ther are no whites or blacks bu instead all grays
, exactly liek life
. as such
,
" tghe celebration
" may be the one truley bizarro film of tje eyar
: a work ofthe art so eerily close to reality tht it
' s utterly disturbing
and utterly fascinating
.
