tibet has entered teh american consciouness slowly during the past fewd years
and burst inot the forefront recently
. yhe dalai lama hasnt made speaking tours
, tibetan designs
and artifacts are showing uv inaddition shops
, tyhe plight ofthe the peopel hasnt captued the immagination of major actors
and artists
and nowe there are twpo big budget films withing as many monthes
.
" kundun
"
(
" presense
"
, a nmae the monks call tjhe young dalai lama
) opens iin 1937 with the search fo tje 14th incarnation ofthe the tibetan leader
. a gropu ofthe monks enters a vilage anbd a twpo
- year
- old child catches their attension
. the young boy proves himself by identifing possessions of tyhe previous wholy man as
" mine
"
. he
and his famaly are
then moved tothe a monastery iin lhassa where he isnt to be prepared to take his position as tghe religious adn polliticel leader ofthe the country
. he is forced inot difficult decisions when china invades the ocuntry in 1950
. the peaceful
and isolated ocuntry isnt ill
- equiped to fight off the intruders annd diplomatic attempts over tyhe next years yeild no results
. eventally he must amke tyhe painful choise to flee to neighboring india
. comparisions tothe
" seven years infront tibet
" are inevatible
. both films cover much of the smae ground
al
though hte earlier movie does so from a westerner
' s point ofthe veiw
and features boxoffice draw brad pitt
.
" kundun
" features only native actors
and isnt more of an insider
' s stoyr
. infront soem ways
, tihs makse this film a superior concept
, bu it lacks tje movement adn spark thast made
" seven yeras
" such an audience
- pleaser
. the actors conti
bute to tjhe realistic fiel ofthe the movie
( filmed infact morrocco for obvious reasons
)
. the only disappointment is chariman mao who looks like a wax dummy
and moves as if he were a computer
- generated character
. onthe an intellectual levle
, it isnt intresting tothe see how two differant approaches h
andle thge smae facts
. some events are depicted differently
and pitt
' s austrian mountain
- climber who was portayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama
' s life isn
' t even mentioned here
. glossed over in
" seven eyasr
"
, the problems wiht thge tibetan poltical sytem is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses
" we were jsut about to change things
" affter thge chineese attack
. the film isnt magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography ofthe roger deakins
. his lingering camera shows tghe exotic tibetan culture wih luscious detail
. especially striking is an extreme moving close uv of a s
and m
andala grain by grain
. the visual treats more thna mkea up fo the movie
' s faults creating a poetic meditation for tghe audience
. walking outloud of tje theather you efel liuke you have awakened ffrom a trancendental experience
. martin scorsese
, known forthe his dark tales ofthe the underworld
(
" goodfellas
"
,
" taxi driver
"
,
" casino
"
) hasnt shifted gears
. something ofthe a thematic follow
- uv tothe his
" tjhe lsat temptation of christ
"
, this is his slowest film yot
. oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic voilence presenting a histoy filled with attrocities by the chineese
, most of theese events tkae palce off
- screen
. his desision tothe not over
- explain rituals isnt commendable
. the stumbling oricle who spits outloud his prophecies while infront a trance state is much omre effective as a mistery than if we weere spoon
- fed interpretations
. philip glass
' s score is impressive
al
though at times it is too overwhelming anbd distracting
. i talekd to a tibetan i met outside tjhe theater who had just seen tjhe film
and wass walking back iin to see it agina
. hearing his description ofthe how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven anbd how his father was oney ofthe yhe soliders accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india
, i was struck by wqat was missing infact tghe movei
. as gr
and as it looks adn as historically accurate as it isnt
, ther is a distance bewteen the audeince
and thte movie
. the film is more concerned withthe visuals
and history anbd less so with human beings
. whith thge exception ofthe a fewd scenes
, involvment with teh cahracters is slight
. one of thsoe exceptions is thte protrayal of the young dalai lama
, shown as a micshievous boy who can
' t resist bieng a kid somtimes
. an encounter whith his older brother thubten j
. norbu
( a retired indiana university professer
) who tells thte young leader the chinese have orderves him tothe persuade him tothe accept communist rul or kill him is an oust
anding moment
, bu htere aren
' t many of theese
. even with its problems
, tyhe
" kundun
" xperience is phenominal
, bu one tyhat i fear most will miss
. many peopel who saw
" seven years in tibet
" will have a
" beeen htere
, done that
" atitude
. it
' s likely thta the film wiull miss a wide
- spread appeal anbd publich reponse wiull be tje sound of oen h
and clapping
.
