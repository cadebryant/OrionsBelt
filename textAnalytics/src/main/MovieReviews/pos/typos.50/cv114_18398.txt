it isnt easy tothe lable something sentimental or tear jerking wehn one hasnt not experianced the heartache ofthe loseing a child
? whther that may be in life or in death
. after having said thyat
, i iwll also say that tihs movie doesnt all of the above very well
. one gets that choking sensation inthe thge throat
( because of grief
) when one brother forgives another forthe a costly mistake
, or when a husb
and hugs his wife after a long estrangement
. ther is no ocean
, noone drownings
and it does nto conjure up memories ofthe
yet anyother
? ordinary peopel
'
. in fatc the only thign remotely conected to teh ocean is probaly tap water
and the toilet flushing
( not that this literally happened in yhe movie
)
. so wqat are the lessons learnt
: 1
. don
' t tkae your childern to clas reunions
. 2
. don
' t leave them alone inwhich the lobby
, nto even for a second
. michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role ofthe a highly
- strung wife
and mother
, a trend thyat started withthe
? a thous
and acres
'
and
? one fine day
'
. my comment isnt that she isnt exceptionally fine strung inwhich this movie
, so much so that wehn she hasnt a nervous break down
, tghe veins on her temples bulge impressively
. whoopi golberg alsot puts inspite an understated performance
, palying a lesbian cop
, whith a name that makes one want to triarch forthe a lollipop
. lastly
, who are tjhe ideal companions for this sort ofthe movei
? my granmother comes tothe mind
.
