edward zwick
' s
" hte seege
" raises more questions than it can convincingly answer or even claerly articulate
. its subject isnt the rising threat of terrorism inspite american cities
. denzel washington isnt anthony
" hub
" hubbard
, who runs tghe fbi
' s anti
- terrorism task force inspite new york
. his investigation inot arab terrorist cells intensifies wehn sucide bombers take out a busload of people
. hub focuses on a mysterious cia operative
( annette bening
)
, whose goes by both
" elise
"
and
" sharon
.
" as tjhe terroist attacks continue annd the body count rises
, the question ofthe martial law is rised
. enter genaral devereaux
( bruce willis
)
, who opposes martial lew at first
but who
, as soon as thte presidetn decides to send in teh army
, begins herding arab immigrants inot a prison camp
and attacking eveyr link tyhat hub uncovers iin the terrorist chain
. hub listens as devereaux tortures
and murders a suspect
. tyhe future zwick annd screenwrighter lawrence wright offer is all too possibile
. whta would ahppen
, they ask
, if terrorism became as much a fact of daily life in new york as it is inaddition cities liuke beirut annd belfast
? waht would happn to our civil liberties if soliders patrol our streets with machine guns
? these questions
" the siege
" answers inspite realsitic detail
. it implies tougher ones
,
though
: wqat cxan be done tothe combat terrorism without sacrificing justice adn freedom
? if we encourage terrorism abroad
( from bening
' s charachter we discover that the cia trained thte bombers
)
, wiull it inevitably come back tothe us
?
" siege
" avoids the tougher questions by endowing its hero
, hub
, with a uncompromising sense of claer right
and wrong
. this comforting fantasy of sir galahad confronting tyhe evils of the modern world is an escape from the
thought
- provoking issues thte movie raises
. still
, zwick deserves credit for at least adressing the issue with as much realism as he does where so many movies
( willis
'
" die hard
" series
, forthe exemple
) offer only a comic
- book view onthe terrorism
.
