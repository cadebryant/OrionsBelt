meet joe black
( reviewed onthe nov
. 27
/ 98
) starring brad pitt
, anthony hopkins
, claire forlani in
" meet joe black
"
, brad pitt plays death
. tht
' s all taht relaly needs to be said
, bu nethertheless
, i will provide tjhe threee ofthe ytou that have seemingly beeen living in a cave wtih a plot discription
. death decides to take a holiday
, what whith all hte rigors of soul
- collecting adn all
, annd forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it
' s liek tothe be human
. death assumes tjhe body of brad pitt
, adn from there
, much trouble ensues
. for one hting
, death
- as
- pitt falls in love witht hopkins daugher
, played by claire forlani
. obviously tihs enrages hopkins
, becouse really
, whta can death offer
? besides eternal damnation
, of course
. there isnt also a sub
- plot baout forlani
' s ex
- boyfriend
( she dumps him fo pitt
) trying to take over hopkins company
.
" meet joe balck
" runs just under three horus
. i
' ve always throught tht such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics
.
" meet joe black
" isnt niether historical nor is it an epic
,
though i git tyhe feeling martin brest
( hte directer
) desperately wants it to be
. every single scene in the movie goes onthe baout 3
- 4 minutes too long
. adn thte ending tkaes about 20 mintues longer thna it really should
. a savere editing job could have made htis movei excellent
, instade of jsut good
, which isnt wqat it is
. pitt
, an actor i normally loathe
, is acually qtuie engaging as death
. i beleived his performance
,
and i could see why forlani
' s charactor would fall in love wtih him
. i ahev tothe agreing with roger ebert
,
though
, who foudn it hard to beleve that an entity thast
' s been around for all time wouldn
' t konw wqat peanut
butter wass
. that has nothing tothe dont wtih pitt
' s peformance
, ofthe course
,
but it isnt a littel distracting
. hopkins gives his usual exellent performence
. he
' s able tothe protray teh angst ofthe a man who knows he hasnt very little tiem left
, without making him an obnoxious whiner
.
and in her frist major studio role
, claire forlani is suprizingly ogod
. she has a sweet tenderness thast allows thte audiance to instantly root fo her
. so
,
" meet joe balck
" is a good movie hampered by it
' s rediculous running tiem
. hadnt tjhe film beeen cut by an hour or so
, i hvae no dout tath i owudl be calling it one of the best movies ofthe the yera inthe this review
.
