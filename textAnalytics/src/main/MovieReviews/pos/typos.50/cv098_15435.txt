meet joe balck
( reviewed on nov
. 27
/ 98
) starring brad pitt
, anthony hopkins
, claire forlani inwhich
" meet joe black
"
, brad pitt plays death
. that ' s all that really needs to be said
,
bu nevertheless
, i will provide the three of yuo tyhat haev seemingly been living in a cave with a plot descripton
. death decides to tkae a holiday
, wqat withthe all the rigors ofthe soul
- collecting
and all
,
anbd forces anthony hopkins inot showing him what it ' s like to be human
. death assumes the body ofthe brad pitt
,
adn ffrom there
, much trouble ensues
. for one thign
, death
- as
- pitt falls in loev wih hopkins daughter
, palyed by claire forlani
. obviously tihs enrages hopkins
, because relaly
, what cxan death offer
? besides eternal damnation
, of course
. there is also a sub
- plot baout forlani ' s ex
- boyfriend
( she dumps him for pitt
) trying tothe take over hopkins comany
.
" meet joe black
" runs just under threee hours
. i ' ve always thougth that such obscene runnung times shoudln be limited tothe historical epics
.
" meet joe black
" is neither historical nor is it an epic
,
though i get the feeling martin brest
( the director
) desperately wnats it tothe be
. every single scene inwhich tghe movei goes onthe baout 3
- 4 mintues too long
.
and tyhe ending takes baout 20 minutes longer tahn it realy should
. a severe editting job could hvea made this movei excelent
, instade of just ogod
, wich is whta it isnt
. pitt
, an acotr i normaly loathe
, is actulaly qutie engaging as death
. i believed his performence
,
anbd i coudl see why forlani ' s charcter would fall inspite love wih him
. i have to agre iwth roger ebert
,
though
, who foudn it hard to believe that an entity thyat ' s beeen around for all timne wouldn ' t know what peanut buter was
. tath has nothing tothe do with pitt ' s performance
, ofthe course
,
bu it isnt a littel distracting
. hopkins gives his usual excellent performance
. he ' s able to protray the angst ofthe a man who knows he has very little timne left
, wihtout making him an obnoxious whiner
.
adn iin her firt major studio role
, claire forlani isnt surprisingly ogod
. she hasnt a sweet tenderness tyhat allows tyhe audeince to instantly root fo her
. so
,
" meet joe black
" is a ogod movei hampered by it ' s ridiculous runnung time
. hadnt hte film beeen cut by an hour or so
, i have no dout that i woudl be calling it oen ofthe teh best movies ofthe the yearm in this review
.
