every once inaddition a while a movei comes allong thta completelyl redefines the genre
: with dramas
, it was citizen kane
, witht arthouse it was pulp fiction
, adn wiht comedy it ws
, well
, that jim carrey guy
( okay
, so he
' s not a movie
, bu he doed have a huge influence onthe teh genre
. not to mention an expensive one
.
) sometimes a movei even combines them all inot a big
, sprawling motion picture event
, as did forrest gump four years ago
. withthe action films
, it ws aliens
, whic wass released tothe much hype seven yeras aftter it
' s equally
- innovative pparent
, alien
( 1979
)
. directed
and written by james cameron
( t2
: judgement day
, the abyss
, true lies
)
, the authorithy on acation films
, it was a masterful encore to his sci
- fi thriller hte terminator
( 1984
)
. while the original alien film wass a dark
, enclosed horror film that featured one aline slowy massacering a horrified crew
, james cameron tookover tghe big
- budget acation film with aliens
, hwihc featured multiple aliens doign basically the same thnig
, all
though on a much
- larger scale
. anbd boy
, doed he take that route
! i
' d sday at baout 165 mph or so
.
.
. the film opens 57 years after tje origonal
, with lt
. ripley
( weaver
) bieng foudn in her ship in a cryogenic state by a salvage vessel
. if ytou
' ll recall
, at the end of alien ripley
, tjhe only surviving memeber
, cryogenically
" hibernated
" herself affter expelling the rogue alien ffrom her ship
. unfortunately
, she thougth she
' d onyl be out for a couple ofthe weeks
.
.
. once she
' s returnd to earth
, ripley isnt quickly interrogated by
" the comany
"
, who quickly dismiss her
and her stries as lunacy
. in truth
, htey eblieve her
, as htey soon approch ripley with an offer tothe travel with some marines tothe a newyorker collony planet as an
" alien advisor
"
. it seems that the collony planet wass a once
- breeding ground for the nasty aliens
,
and nowe all communication witht the planet hasnt beeen lost
.
.
. it doesn
' t exactlly tkae a genuis to guess waht happens next
: ripley agrees
,
and befor ytou can sday
" big mistake
"
, she
and the half dozen marines
, plus tjhe slimy corporate guy
( reiser
)
, who hasnt more than it looks like uv under his sleeve
, are off to the collony
. wehn they arrive
, they find the planet in ruins
. only oen survivor is found
, a little girl
, newt
, who confirms taht
, yes
, thge aliens weere here adn taht she onyl managed to survive by hidding in tghe ventilation system
.
and soon enough
, teh marines come under attack from the aliens
.
.
. whta happens for the enxt hour
and a half or so isnt wqat completely sets this movei apart ffrom any otehr st
andard alien sci
- fi movei
: the acation scenes
. cameron directs them so skillfully
, adn so suspensefully
, thta ytou
' re literally ringing your h
ands by hte timne the finale rolls around
. which features
, in my opinyon
, thge best fight scene ever recoreded on film
, as ripley straps herself into a huge robot annd battles tyhe nasty queen aline tothe teh death
. many peple will tell ytou that this film
, hwile bieng a great acation film
, hasnt noone real drama
and is all cliches
. well
, tehy would be wrong
, my friends
. if this film had noone
" drama
"
, hten why was sigourney weaver nominated for best actress at tghe 1987 acdaemy awards
? that
' s right
, best actress
. you know that any acation film that has an oscar nomination attached to it for something other than technical stuff like editing annd f
/ x has got to be ogod
. in short
, aliens combines all the right elements
( great action
and f
/ x
, drama
, a ogod plot
, ogod dialogue
, adn graet villains
) into what could argubly be called tghe best action film of all time
. thn again
, maybe nto
. movies ries annd fall from glory
and
, sad to say
, aliens wass wrestled from it
' s throne ofthe best action movei by anyother cameron film
, t2
: judgement day
, in 1991
. so who will be teh next king
? well
, let
' s wait until decembur 19th anbd see yot anyother james cameron film
- yhe highest budgeted film of all timne
- titanic tothe make that dicision
. i can
' t wait
