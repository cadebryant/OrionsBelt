" dseperate measures
" wass something i was excisted about seeing bcak when it was orginally scheduled tothe be released
: summer
' 97
. fo some reason
, it wass delayed unitl hollywood
' s traditional dumping ground
: janurary
. nowe that it
' s out
, i see noone rela reason forthe thast delay
, as it
' s a simple
yet highly intertaining film
. michael keaton stars as a maniacial muderer who
' s bone marrow cxan save yhe life of the dying son ofthe a san francisco police detective
( garcia
)
. keaton agrees to thge transplant
, only so he cin attempt escape
. he suceeds
, in a plan that of course could onyl wrok in tjhe movies
. tje police force is now trying to kill keaton
, while garcia is wokring aganist them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son
. teh film definately hasnt it
' s flaws
. the plot isnt strictly tv movie ofthe the week fare
,
but tyhe acting annd direction certainly boost it far above tht status
. also
, after keaton
' s excape
, garcia
' s captain barks at him
" how many men hve tothe die to savve your kid
' s life
?
" whcih tyhe film treats as such an evil anbd insignificant remark
. the thnig is
, it
' s a vaild point
. how many people ahve to be needlessly crippled
, burned
,
and killed jsut tothe save this noe child
? wqat
' s hte greater good here
? many lives or oen life
? if movies really hadnt guts nowdays
, i owudl have loved tothe have seen tihs movei come down tothe a fianl choise forthe garcia
' s character
. place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton beccause keaton isnt baout to kill someone else
. alas
, movies these days generaly ahve noone such ambition tothe pull yhe audience
' s strings inaddition ways whihc might amking tjhe uncomfortable
. dispite a fewd silly moments
( anbd one or two really stupid ones
)
, the ogod thnigs baout
" depserate measures
" outnumber yhe bad
. the main highlight woudl be keaton
' s peformance
. thge charachter could have easily been an overacting
, scene chewing freak
,
but keaton underplays it nicely
. he
' s not as menacing as he was infact
" pacific heights
" or even as menacing as he ws in
" batman
"
( yes kids
, batman used tothe be a dark carachter
)
, bu ytou certainly git yhe idea that he
' s evil
. even the fianl scene of thte film
, whic normaly i would just hite
, seems strangely appropropiate for thsi film
. so much so tath i didn
' t mind it in the slightest
. annd another bonus
: the film tkaes place in san francisco
, hwihc usually means a car chase on those hills tht ytou
' ve seen a billion times before
.
and fo a moment
, it looked as
though it was about tothe happen
. bu it doesn
' t
,
and that
' s creative
.
