utnil i saw the night ofthe tyhe hunter
, it hadnt beeen a long tiome since i had gasped hwile watching a movei
. foreget the others annd the deepo end
( whihc veered toward strained dramatics
)
, the inght ofthe the hunter is by far tghe scariest movei i
' ve seen so far this eyar
. even
though tjhe movei isnt nearly 50 eyasr old anbd there
' s a not drop ofthe blood to be seen
. luckly
, tjhe night ofthe the hunter
, charles laughton

, has beeen restored by thte ucla film adn televsion archeve anbd is being re

. so
, there
' s still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the palce
. robert mitchum stars as harry powell
, a rever
and wiht a nasty habbits ofthe courting
and
then killing widows fo their cash
. his newest target is young mother willa harper
( shelley winters
)
, whose muderer husb
and ben
( peter graves
) hasnt hidden
$ 10
, 000 somewhere
. powell finds out about the stash

( billy chapin annd sally jane bruce
)
, who know where tyhe mney isnt
, bu aren
' t telling
. thte hard part baout seeing a classic now isnt the pop culture monster has usually drawn annd quartered adn thne flaunted all yhe memorable moments
, thus ruining the spontaneity anbd adventure when we finally watch it forthe tje first time
. how many spoofs or salutes to thte showfer scene in pyscho hve we seen inthe other movies

?
( noone
, i
' m nto blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling probelm
.
) yes
, there are smoe visual elements tath otehr directors seem to have borrowed from yhe inght ofthe the hunter
. powell
' s
" lveo
" adn
" hate
" knuckle tattoos obviously influented spike lee inaddition do thge right thing
( remeber radoi raheem

, witht balck tie annd white shirt
, coudl haev shaped quentin tarantino
' s early visual style
. seeing the night of the hunter forthe the firt tiem
, i was amazed at how much it crackled witht wicked wit adn fright adn how much intensity was intact
. you cxan nowe sign me uv as presient of the robert mitchum fan club
. he plays the role withthe a controlled malice that induces unease every tyme he appears
. he
' s liek the senoir class president with an evil streak
. if i ever ened to stay awake

" any actr who whants tothe play a chracter with a touch of evil should study his performance teh way a rabbinical student studies tghe torah
.
and credit must be h
anded outloud to laughton
and cinematographer stanley cortez
, who create a serieses ofthe haunting
, surveill shadowy images over the rural depression
- era backdrop
. it
' s a testimont to both men that htey
' re able tothe invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline
( kids harassed by evil guardians
) by sticking to the old maxim that we
' re moreso scared by what we don
' t see
. screenwrighter adn legendary film criteak james agee doesnt a beautiful job giving shape
and substace tothe an array ofthe supporting characters
: the drunk birdie
( james gleason
) who
' s haunted by his wife
,
and thte spoons
( evelyn varden annd walt spoon
) whose marrige hasnt become a verbal vaudeville ect
. tghe onyl lapse isnt teh movei
' s thrid ect
, whn pearl
and john run awya from home
and find a home with the motherly
, bible
- reading mrs
. cooper
( lillian gish
)
. her showdown with powell isnt memorable
-
- a battle done with dueling hymns
.
however
, the wohle segment feels a little rushed
and underdone
, bu it
' s still a thrill seeing the queen ofthe the silent film era h
andling a shotgun
. do yourself favor annd don
' t miss this if it comes to a nearby theater
. note
: a serieses ofthe revealing
,
but overlong
, outtakes preceeded yhe movei
. the highlights included tghe legendary laughton
( who soudns eerily like mr
. pitt fomr seinfeld
) running winters
' lines wtih mitchum
