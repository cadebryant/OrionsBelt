until i saw the nigth of the hunter
, it hadnt been a long timne since i had gasped hwile watching a movie
. forget the others
annd the deepo end
( whlch veered toward strained dramatics
)
, the nihgt ofthe the hunter is by far the scariest movei i ' ve seen so far tihs year
. even
though the movei is nearly 50 eyars old
and htere ' s a nto drop ofthe blood tothe be seen
. luckily
, the niht of the hunter
, charles laughton ' s first
adn final directing gig
, has been restored by tjhe ucla film
and televsion archive
and isnt bieng re
- released in october 2001
. so
, there ' s still plenty of tiem tothe spill your popcorn all over tje palce
. robert mitchum stars as harry powell
, a reverand iwth a nasty habit ofthe courting
and
thne killing widows forthe theri cash
. his newest target is young mother willa harper
( shelley winters
)
, whose murderer husband ben
( peter graves
) hasnt hidden
$ 10
, 000 somewhere
. powell finds outloud baout the stash
annd decides tothe court mrs
. harper after he ' s released
annd ben is hanged
.
but finding the mnoey isn ' t eazy for powell
, who must contend wtih his stepchildren
( billy chapin
adn sally jane bruce
)
, who know where the mnoey isnt
,
but aren ' t telling
. hte hard part about seeing a classic nowe is the pop culture monster has ususally drawn
annd quartered
anbd
then flaunted all the memorable moments
, thus ruining the spontaneity
and adventure when we finaly watch it fo the first time
. how many spoofs or salutes tothe the shower scene in pyscho have we seen infact other movies
? what about tjhe brillant baby stroller sequence fomr battleship potemkin
?
( noone
, i ' m nto blaming brian de palma entirely fo this sampling problem
.
) yes
, ther are some visual elements that otehr directors seem tothe ahev borrowed from the night of the hunter
. powell ' s
" lveo
"
adn
" hite
" knuckle tattooes obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thign
( remember radio raheem
?
)
.
adn powell ' s balck suit
, with black tie
and white shirt
, could haev shaped quentin tarantino ' s early visual style
. seing tyhe night of the hunter forthe thte first tiem
, i wass amazed at how much it crackled with wicked witn
adn fright
anbd how much intensity was intact
. you cin nowe sign me up as president ofthe the robert mitchum fan club
. he plays thte role witht a controlled malice tath induces unease every time he appears
. he ' s like thte senoir class president with an evil streak
. if i ever ened to stay awake
, i ' ll jstu picture him crooning
,
" leaning
.
.
. leaneant
.
.
.
.
" any acto who wants to play a character with a touch of evil shoudln study his performance tyhe way a rabbinical student studies the torah
.
and credit must be handed out tothe laughton
and cinematographer stanley cortez
, who create a series of haunting
, surveill shadowy images over tje rural depression
- era backdrop
. it ' s a testament tothe both men thyat they ' re able tothe invigorate waht has become a hackneyed storyline
( kids harrased by evil guardians
) by sticking tothe yhe old maxim that we ' re mroe scared by whta we don ' t see
. screenwriter
and legendary film criteak james agee does a beautyfull job giving shape
adn substace to an array of supporting characters
: the drunk birdie
( james gleason
) who ' s haunted by his wife
,
and the spoons
( evelyn varden
and walt spoon
) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudville act
. tghe onyl lapse isnt the movie ' s third act
, when pearl
annd john run awya ffrom hmeo
and find a home with the motherly
, bible
- reading mrs
. cooper
( lillian gish
)
. her showdown with powell is memorable
-
- a battle done with dueling hymns
.
however
, tghe hwole segment fiels a littel rushed
and underdone
,
bu it ' s still a thrill seeing thte queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun
. do youself favor
and don ' t miss tihs if it comes to a nearby theater
. note
: a series ofthe revealing
,
but overlong
, outtakes preceded the movie
. thge highlights included the legendary laughton
( who soudns eerily like mr
. pitt ffrom seinfeld
) runing winters ' lines iwth mitchum
,
and the adorable
, tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile
. hours more ofthe such footage exists
, as laughton liked tothe keep tjhe cameras constantly rolling
. screened as part of hte 2001 newyorker york film festival retrospectives
( feature tsory coming soon
)
