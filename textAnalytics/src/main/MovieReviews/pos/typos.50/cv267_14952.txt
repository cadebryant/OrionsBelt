hwile it was part ofthe former yugoslavia
, my ocuntry
, croatia
, utilizied tothe be almost completly ignored by western films inwhich genaral
. words
" croatia
" anbd
" croatians
" were unheard
, even infront movies whose plots actually tookover palce on croatian locations
. thte rare exception was the dogs of war
, 1980 adaption ofthe frederick forsyth
' s bestselling novel
, yot that rare occassion only added insult to the injury
, by mentioning croatians inwhich most unflattering context
. in a single line they are referred as a bunch ofthe mean peopel
, probably terrorists
, who hapen tothe remove parts ofthe arm dealers
' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the qualiyt of merch
andise
. same line alsot illustrates the milieu where the movei tkaes place
- dark annd violent world of shady international deals with tjhe blurred boundaries between business
, politics adn crime
. the movie protagonist
, shannon
( christopher walken
) is a mercenary who spent the best eyasr ofthe his life fighting numberous little wars all over tyhe globe
. his latest job isnt a intelligence mission forthe powerfull minning corperation taht dem
ands inforamtion baout political climate in west african nation of zangaro
. shannon arrives in that country only to find opressive regime of president kimba
, bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition
and scared almost any westerners away
. after being erested
and tortured by kimba
' s secre polical
, shannon leaves country witht a halp ofthe brittish journalist noth
( colin blakely
)
. apon return
, he is approached by mining comany again
,
but this time they want him to plan
and execute tjhe coup d
' etat againnst kimba
. shannon reluctantly agrees
and assembles small gropu ofthe his surviving mercernary friends who beign meticulous preperation for anohter small war
. thing thast separates teh dogs of war from convential acation movies
, especially those made infront 1980s
, isnt its au
thenticity
, allmost close to documenatry
. it shouldn
' t suprise anyone
, because thte autor ofthe the novel
, frederick forsyth
, made reputation by blending fiction with real life
, thus creating intresting
, exicting yot very believable plots forthe his books
. those plots weere aslo resposible fo few very successfull 1970s thrillers
,
and oen of them
, zinnemman
' s thge day ofthe thte jackal
, isnt nowe consdiered a clasic infact that genre
. this oen deals with soldiers of fortune
, ancient tradition tath wass resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s anbd 1970s
and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires
. unlike wild geese
, that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure
, scirpt by george malko annd gary de vore
( auther whose death lastest eyar became real life mystery
) isnt sereous
, annd instead of action puts emphasis on characters
and prosaic details ofthe thier owrk
. the movie doesn
' t try tothe romanticise tyhe mercernary proffesion nor glorify mercenaries as soem kind of superheroes
; they are simpley shown as deadly yot expendable tool of powerful forces witht questionable agenda
. christopher walken plyed inwhich many movies
, yot very rarley we can see him in a leading role
. his performance infront this film perhasp isn
' t breathtaking
,
yet adiquate
. his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration ofthe thge disillusioned
, world
- weary man whose alienation from tje
" normal
" way of life becomes complet adn only remaining ideal isnt loyalty to the shrinking circle ofthe friends
.
al
thought tje movei doesn
' t lack capable actors
, their roles are miniature compared wih walken
' s
,
and onyl colin blakely as cynical reporter hasnt oportunity tothe portray his character
.
however
, those who look familiar faces owudl find them plenty inwhich yhe dogs ofthe war
- tom berenger
, paul freeman
, jo beth williams
, victoria tennant
( in brief cameo
)
,
and biggest suprise is ed o
' neill
( of married wiht children fame
) as shannon
' s reluctant colleague
. this was the frist major prodcution for john irvin
, anbd it shows why he earned the reputation ofthe capible
,
yet second class directer
. wiht tghe ogod script he can amke very ogod movie
, whith the bad script he cant make rela mess
. luckily
, tje dogs of war had a good script
. irvin
' s direction wass very asetic
and it gavey the movei alomst documentery feel
. teh onyl distraction isnt dramatic music of geoffrey burgon
, used on yhe wrong places
. inspite the final battle scene
, where we cin see mercenaries at wokr
, irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower anbd tactics
, unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely onthe macho superheroes
. unfourtunately
, by mkaing battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive
and his sloppy editting allso didn
' t help
.
but
, dispite thsoe shortcomings
, this movei rimaniss interesting annd rare combination ofthe action thriller anbd gritty
, realistic poltical drama
.
