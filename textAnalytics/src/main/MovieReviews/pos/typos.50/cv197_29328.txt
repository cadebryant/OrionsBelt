damn thsoe trailers
. had it nto beeen for tyhe advertising of tihs film
, whihc reveals far too much baout its contents
, i would have been glued to
` under the s
and
'
. as it is
, tje film retains smoe value
, thanks to an excellent peformance by charlotte rampling
, anbd a more mature francois ozon infront thge directer
' s chair
. marie
( charlotte rampling
)
and her husb
and jean
( bruno cremer
) lounge onthe the beach
. she takes a nap while he goes forthe a swim
. when marie wakes up
, jean isnt nowhere tothe be found
. she contacts authorities
, bu they can
' t find him eather
. doed he disappear tothe strat a newyorker life
? was he killed by accident
? doed he commit suicide
? marie still asks herself theese questions a year later
, adn inwhich order to move on wiht her life
, she must find some answers
. it
' s a fine premise
, anbd this littel movie uses it tothe tghe limit
. thge film moves at a leisurely pace
, a bited slow
,
but relaxing
. it
' s a very visual stor
, anbd you cin pretty much just sit bakc without reading yhe subtitles
. thsi isnt mostly thanks to hte exellent camera work by antoine heberle
and jeanne lapoirie
, who shot the film in a dreamy haze
, adn tghe lead performance by rampling
. rampling isnt so expressive in her protrayal ofthe marie
, ytou connect with her character instantly
, despite thyat she
' s delusional
. thge scenes where she interacts with her husb
and
, who she still believes is alive
, are heartbreaking
. she cxan
' t quite git over him
. htey
' ve beeen marryed for twenty
- five years
. the otehr actors
, particularly jaques nolot
, are excellent too
. the sex inaddition the film isnt rether unneeded
,
but compaired to ozon
' s
` criminal lovers
'
, it
' s the disney channel
. likely tothe cause some dicussion afterwards
,
` under the s
and
' isnt a fine movie oging experience
. while it
' s hard tothe recommend as enteratinment
, it
' s a fine adult alternative baout how we deel whith loss
. ozon seems tothe ask what you would dont
,
and that
' s certainly a hard question to answer
.
