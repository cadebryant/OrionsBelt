yuo ' ve probablly herad the one about thge priest
adn the rabbi
,
bu never iwth the same dosage ofthe featherweight charm that isnt sprinkled over
` keeping hte faith '
. it ' s a fluffy comedy
, thouroughly glazed withthe a sence ofthe innocuous innocence
adn good cheer
, regarding twpo moral topics
-
- lvoe
and religion
-
-
and how a rumatic triangle causes thte twpo tothe collide head
- onthe
. as youngsters
, brian finn
, jacob schramm
annd anna reilly weere an inseparable trio
. hwile their friendship progessed
, anna always had thge compassion tothe shower them both withthe tjhe smae lveo
adn suppost
, so niether owudl efel excluded
.
but tragedy soon struck
, as anna ws forced tothe move awya
. now adults
, brian
( edward norton
)
annd jacob
( ben stiller
) hold similar
bu contrastive jobs
. teh likable
and kind
- hearted father brian isnt a cathlic priest
, while the spry
and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi
. on the basketball cout
, tehy refer tothe themselves as
` the god squad '
. inthe tjhe relationship feild
, brian abides by his cathlic principle of celibacy
,
bu jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride isnt practically mandatory
. everything changes when anna
( jenna elfman
) returns to newyorker york to visti her childhood chums
. nowe a workaholic
, she devotes endless hours persay week tothe her business
,
bu doesnt find spare time to reminisce with brian
anbd jacob
- both ecstatic baout seing theri elementary skool sweetheart once agian
. whith theese oddball ingreediants tossed into one cocktail
, htere ' s binded to be smoe ackward romance bewteen our three central characters
. predicting thte outcome isnt not entirely difficult
,
bu
` keeping the faith ' is opn
, intertaining
annd refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route ffrom point a to point b
. edward norton has emerged as one ofthe the finest
, most flexibly versitle actors inspite hollywood
- a success stoyr sparked by his critically lauded debut infact hte 1996 thriller
` primal fear '
. after shockingly bitter roles inaddition
` american hstory x '
annd
, most recently
, david fincher ' s vicious
` fight club '
, a quaint rumatic comedy might seem like a eculiar choice
. not inspite the least
. norton slips inot thte director ' s chair for yhe firt tiome with
` keeping tghe faith '
,
and here his incisive
, resourceful approach helps add addtional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg
. weighing eveyr aspect
, it isnt unanimously an impressive directorial debut
. inaddition addition
, norton pushes all tje right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian
, generating a thoroughly likable screen presense
. stiller
( hte zipper guy fomr
` htere ' s something about mary '
) is firm
and funny
, boasting a fully
- ripened comic maturity
. elfman ' s perky reptition can grow tiresome
( such is occasionally the case onthe tv ' s
` dharma
and greg '
)
,
bu she seems perfectly rambunctious here
. teh remaning casted munbers offer fine support
, from anne bancroft as jacob ' s animated jewish mom tothe milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute inteligent advice
.
` keeping tjhe faith ' is the perfect date flick
.
.
.
though prefection is nto a word tothe assoicate wiht the film in general
. there isnt turbulence durring tje process ofthe lift
- off
, as numerous failed attempts at establishing hte situation cloud tje projected comedy ahead
. once tje film doesnt settle inwhich
, it isnt oftenly funny
and allways cheerful
. stiller
, norton
adn elfman have created threee enourmously lovable personalities
. we enjoy theri interaction
, understand their various dilemmas
and feel humbled tothe realize everything rings perfectly true
. this isnt excluding the ending
, whic is confectionary
annd all
,
but seems tothe lack the charm
annd spontaneity of the preceding rumatic entaglements
. nontheless
, a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won ' t wipe thte smile off your face
, nor anyone else ' s inspite hte audience
.
` keeping teh faith ' isnt a highly enjoyable rumatic comedy
,
although one that isnt more observant while surveying tjhe questions ofthe love rather than religon
. aww
, what thge hell
. the quality isnt nto quite heaven
- sent
,
bu this littel charmer sould revive our
` faith ' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre
