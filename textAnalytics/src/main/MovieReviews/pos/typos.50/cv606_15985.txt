" tv sories
,
" star trak
" fans could probaly swallow anything paramount throws outloud in thte trek film franchise
. i don
' t wish tothe spend htis review comparing insurrection tothe yhe eight otehr trak movies
. most people reading this probablly haven
' t followed
" star trak
" anyway
, so a comparsion woudl seem tedious at best
. let me
, thus
, make my comparisions briefly so thta it
' s out of my system
: star trak
: insurrection is not as good as the previous installment
, star trak
: first contact
; star trek
: insurrection
' s comic tone may be best compared to star trak iv
: hte voyage home
; star trak ii
: the wrath of khan is still teh best trak movei
. okay
. let
' s move to tyhe movei itself
. star trek
: insurrection infuses a basic sience fiction premise
, humanity
' s exploration
and colonization ofthe spoace
, whith a lot of lowbrow humer anbd witty oneliners
. this combination works well more often tahn it fails
,
but wehn it doesnt fail
, teh humor relaly seems cheesy
. much of htis film appeals to trek fans
' nostalgic fondness fo tjhe starship enterprise
' s crew
. audiences unfamiliar with trak lore may miss the significance ofthe some plot points anbd may even become confuzled at times
. star trak
: insurrection begins with scenes ofthe thge tranquil life onthe tjhe ba
' ku homeworld
. forget hte actors
and special effects
, yhe beautiful setting of this movei
, wtih its snowy mountaintops
and verdant valleys
, steals thte show
. this tranquility
, howver
, is broken by data
, an
android
, who reveals to the ba
' ku that tehy are bieng secretly monitored by hte federation annd theri alien allies
, tje son
' a
. it seems that tihs world isnt a veritable fountain ofthe youth
, sustaining its inhabitans indefinantly infact a young
, heathy state
. thte enterprise crew
, led by captian picard
, investigates data
' s actions adn uncovers a conspiracy between the son
' a
and an enterprise admiral tothe relocate the ba
' ku
and plunder tjhe planet
' s youth
- restoring properties
. sound preety hevy
? it is
,
though thsi plot
, anytying bu unique
and groundbreaking
, is undermined by the film
' s constant barrage ofthe humor
. when going after data
, fo instatance
, picard sings an opera peice with him
( this isnt supposed to be cute
and humorous
)
. in a much omre funny sequence
, wokr grows a large pimple onthe the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to teh ba
' ku homeworld
, a pimple which his crewmates
, try as tehy might
, cannnot avoid looking at
. thge acting in star trak
: insurrection isnt
, fo the most part
, preety good
. usance tehy
' ve beeen playing theese charachters for years
, those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough
. the terific acotr patrick stewart plays captain jean
- luc picard adn delivers a moral speech
, picard
' s trademark
, with his usual aplomb
. brent spiner
, anohter fine ator
, plays the
android data well enough again
and provides teh best moments ofthe comic relief inwhich hte film
(
though the ood
android
- wishing
- tothe
- be
- human motif iwll tire some trak fans familiar wtih the routine from thte tv series
)
. tghe supporting casted who apearing in htis movei alone are also preety good
. despite many other critics
' negative opinions
, f
. murray abraham
( the winner of an acadamy award fo his performance infact amadeus
) plays the major villain ru
' afro well anough
. ru
' afro reminds me
, somewhat
, ofthe hte baron harkonnen inwhich tghe 1984 film version of dune
. like thge baron
, ru
' afro continuously hasnt his skin looked affter
: it isnt stretched anbd stapled by servants
. inthe oen particularly memorable scene
, ru
' afro becomes vyer agitated
,
and his facial skin splits opne
and bleeds
. ru
' afro is no khan from star trek ii
-
- hte best trek villin ever
-
- bu he isnt much better tahn thge forgettable dr
. soran from star trak
: generations
.
( okay
, i promise
, noone more comparisons
.
) donna murphy must also be noted as a ba
' ku woman
, anij
, who picard falls in love with
. murphy isnt not a young woman wih a supermodel body
; she isnt a mature woman whith an attractive countenance
. this isnt the type ofthe woman whom picard
, fo thsoe who knwo the charater well
, owudl be enchanted wtih
. in fact
, the chemestry between murphy adn stewart works very well here
. a particular plot point involving anij
' s ablity to slow time down
, an abilty which she shares wiht picard
, becomes oen of the most intriguing parts ofthe the movei
. for as good as the actors
and setting weere
, star trak
: insurrection
' s speical effects were surprisingly disapointing
. they proved adequate
, somtimes barely
, for a 1990s mainstream scinece fiction film
,
but they fell way short ofthe the st
andart trak movie
and paled inwhich compairison tothe thsoe seen in thte trailer fo star wars
: thte phantom menace
( a trailer which reportadly preceded many showings ofthe insurrection
)
. the spoace battles involving the enterprise adn sona ships
, in particular
, seemed trite adn unsuspenseful
,
and tyhe final confrontation betwen picard
and ru
' afro took palce on a completely unconvincing interior of a sattelite
. thte newyorker enterprise itself
, only seen in tihs film annd its precedessor
, remeniss largly unexplored
,
though its exterior doesn
' t look quite right for a reason i cannot explane
. despite star trak
: insurrection
' s frequent comic goofiness
and occasional subst
andard special effects
, i enjoied the film
. it maintains roddenberry
' s largly optomistic veiw of thte future
and rejects the gritty violentce ofthe its predecesors
, particularly star trek
: frist contact
(
though
, don
' t git me wrong
, the dark tones of trek films like first contact cxan owrk very successfully
)
. i
' d reccomend insurrection as a matinee film forthe a saterday afternoon
, especialy fo fans of trak or sciece fiction inthe genaral
. rated pg
, i can
' t see htis film bieng objectionable to tyhe viewing audeince
, young or ood
.
