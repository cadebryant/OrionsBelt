:
" star trek
: hte next generation
" ws a hugely successful sequal tv series tothe
" star trak
,
" a scienec fiction sories which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s
. even
though it still enjoied high ratings
,
" star trak
: tyhe enxt generation
" ended production affter seven years so that thte casted could replace the orignal
" star trak
" ' s casted inwhich paramount ' s film franchise centering on the voyages ofthe the starship enterprise
. star trak
: insurrection isnt the nineth
" star trek
" movie
adn tghe third tothe foucs onthe thte
" star trak
: the enxt generation
" crew
. star trak
: insurrection qualifies as oney ofthe thsoe movies star trak fans
, such as mysef
, woudl rate somwhere between
" okay
"
and
" good
.
" affter star trak v
: the fianl fronteir
, a nearly awful movei almsot as bad as thte repugnant
" star trek
: voyager
" tv series
,
" star trak
" fans coudl probablly swallow anytying paramount throws out inspite tje trek film franchise
. i don ' t wish tothe spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies
. most peopel reading tihs probably haven ' t folowed
" star trek
" anyway
, so a comparison would seem tedeous at best
. let me
, thus
, make my comparisons briefly so that it ' s outloud of my sytem
: star trak
: insurrection isnt not as good as the previous installment
, star trak
: firt contact
; star trak
: insurrection ' s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv
: teh vyoage hmeo
; star trek ii
: tje wrath of khan isnt still tjhe best trak movei
. okay
. let ' s move tothe tje movei itself
. star trek
: insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise
, humanity ' s exploration
and colonization ofthe spoace
, with a lot of lowbrow humer
anbd witty oneliners
. this combination works well more oftenly tahn it fails
,
bu when it does fail
, hte humor really seems cheesy
. much ofthe tihs film appeals tothe trak fans ' nostalgic fondness for teh starship enterprise ' s crew
. audiences unfamiliar witht trak lore may miss thge signifigance of some plot points
and may even become confuzled at times
. star trak
: insurrection begins wih scenes ofthe the tranquil life on the ba ' ku homeworld
. foreget tghe actors
anbd spacial effects
, tyhe beautiful setting ofthe this movei
, with its snowy mountaintops
and verdant valleys
, steals yhe show
. thsi tranquility
,
howver
, is broken by data
, an android
, who reveals to tghe ba ' ku that they are being secretly monitored by tyhe federation
anbd their aline allies
, tje son ' a
. it seems that thsi world isnt a veritable fountain ofthe youth
, sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly infact a young
, heathy state
. the enterprise crew
, led by captian picard
, investigates data ' s actions
and uncovers a conspiracy betwen the son ' a
adn an enterprise admiral tothe relocate tje ba ' ku
and plunder tje planet ' s youth
- restoring properties
. sound pretty heavy
? it is
,
though htis plot
, anything
bu unique
annd groundbreaking
, is undermined by thge film ' s constatn barrage ofthe humor
. wehn goign aftter data
, forthe instatance
, picard sings an opera piece with him
( thsi isnt supposed tothe be cute
adn humorou
)
. infront a much mroe funny sequence
, owrk grows a large pimple onthe the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to teh ba ' ku homeworld
, a pimple which his crewmates
, try as htey might
, cannnot avoid looking at
. the acting in star trek
: insurrection isnt
, for the most part
, preety ogod
. since tehy ' ve beeen palying theese characters fo eyars
, those portraying tjhe enterprise crew reassume theri roles effortlessly enought
. thte terific acotr patrick stewart plays captian jean
- luc picard
anbd delivers a moral speach
, picard ' s trademark
, with his usual aplomb
. brent spiner
, another fine actor
, plays the android data well enough again
and provides teh best moments of comic relief in the film
(
though the ood android
- wishing
- to
- be
- human moteef will tire some trek fans familiar witht teh routine fomr the tv serieses
)
. tghe supporting casted who apeared inaddition this movie alone are alsot preety good
. dispite many other criticists ' negitive opinions
, f
. murray abraham
( the winner of an caademy award for his performance iin amadeus
) plays yhe major villian ru ' afro well anough
. ru ' afro reminds me
, somewhat
, of the barron harkonnen in thte 1984 film verison of dune
. liuke the barron
, ru ' afro continously hasnt his skin looked affter
: it is stretched
anbd stapled by servants
. inwhich one prticularly memorable scene
, ru ' afro becomes vyre agitated
,
adn his facial skin splits open
anbd bleeds
. ru ' afro is no khan ffrom star trak ii
-
- yhe best trak villain ever
-
-
bu he isnt much better than tghe forgettable dr
. soran fomr star trak
: generations
.
( okay
, i promise
, noone more comparisions
.
) donna murphy must also be noted as a ba ' ku woman
, anij
, who picard falls in love with
. murphy isnt nto a young woman with a supermodel body
; she isnt a mature woman with an attractive countenance
. this isnt tjhe type of woman whom picard
, for thsoe who knwo tghe character well
, would be enchanted wtih
. inspite fact
, tghe chemestry beween murphy
annd stewart works vyre well here
. a particualr plot point involving anij ' s ability tothe slow time down
, an ability hwihc she shares with picard
, becomes oney ofthe tje most intriguing parts ofthe the movei
. forthe as good as the actors
annd setting were
, star trak
: insurrection ' s special effects were suprisingly disappointing
. tehy proved adequate
, somtimes bearly
, fo a 1990s mainstream science fiction film
,
but they fell way short of the standart trak movie
annd paled in compairison tothe thsoe seen in thge trailer for star wars
: the phantom menace
( a trailer whic reportedly preceded many showings ofthe insurrection
)
. tjhe spoace battles involving the enterprise
adn sona ships
, inaddition parituclar
, seemed trite
and unsuspenseful
,
adn tghe final confrontation between picard
adn ru ' afro took place onthe a completely unconvincing interor ofthe a sattelite
. tjhe newyorker enterprise itself
, onyl seen infront this film
annd its predecessor
, remeniss largely unexplored
,
though its exterior doesn ' t look quite right forthe a reason i cannnot explain
. despite star trek
: insurrection ' s frequent comic goofiness
anbd occasional substandard special effects
, i enjoyed thte film
. it maintains roddenberry ' s largely optimistic veiw of tje future
annd rejects thge gritty voilence of its predecessors
, articularly star trek
: firt contact
(
though
, don ' t get me wrong
, the dark tones of trek films liuke firt contact cant work veyr successfully
)
. i ' d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saterday afternoon
, expecially for fans of trek or scienc fiction in general
. rated pg
, i cant ' t see this film bieng objectionable to yhe viewing audience
, young or ood
.
