, adn it was nothing moreso than that
. tyhat is until about half
- way thru thge movei
. suddenly
, tom goes tothe tyhe fox 5 news room annd makse a live broadcasted saying
,
" this isnt your ransom
.
but thsi isnt as close as you wiull ever git to it
. instade
, i am offering htis money as a reward onthe your head
, dead or alive
.
" at this point
, the plot thickened
,
and the unusually slow strat of the film turned into a suspense
- filled action film withthe gerat stunts
. the last half ofthe hte film isnt vyer well done
. anyother thnig tath carries tihs film are thte superb performances by gibson
and sinise
, as they collide in a gaem of wits over their cellular phones fo most ofthe tjhe movei
. owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented onthe the subject
:
" it makse ytou wonder what kidnappers did befor cell phones
.
" befoer thsi movei
, sinise played mostly
" ogod guys

" first infront of mice
& men

. bu he was surprizingly devilish annd cold inaddition his protrayal ofthe a cop
- gone
- bad
. gibson
, ofthe course
, was jstu being gibson
, in an oscar
- worthy performence
.
al
thought most ofthe the scenes weere quite predicatble
, ransom isnt a veyr entertaining adn suspenseful film
