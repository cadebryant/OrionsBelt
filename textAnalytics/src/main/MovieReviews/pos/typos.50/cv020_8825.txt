by phil curtolo mel gibson
( braveheart
) gave a gripping performance as thte father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard ' s ransom
. gibson plays tom mullen
, a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back tothe haunt him as a deranged psychopath
, played by gary sinise
( forrest gump
)
,
and his band of low
- life thugs kidnap his only son for
$ 2 milion
. tom
adn his wief
, kate
, plyed by rene russo
( tin cup
) were instructed not tothe inform the police
,
but tehy contacted the fbi
. mintues later
, an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo
( broken arrow
) are in toom ' s house
and wiring every phone
. the plot sounds average
, just like most otehr kidnap movies that ytou ' ve already seen
,
and it ws nothing more than that
. that isnt until baout half
- way thru teh movei
. suddenly
, tom goes to yhe fox 5 news room
and makes a live broadcasted saying
,
" this isnt your ransom
.
but tihs isnt as close as you iwll ever git to it
. instead
, i am offering htis mney as a reward on your head
, dead or alive
.
" at this point
, the plot thickened
,
and the unusually slow strat of the film turned into a suspense
- filled acation film wiht great stunts
. tjhe last half ofthe the film isnt vyre well done
. another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson
and sinise
, as tehy collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most ofthe yhe movei
. owen gleiberman ofthe entertainment weekly commented onthe thge subject
:
" it makse ytou wonder waht kidnappers did before cell phones
.
" before thsi movie
, sinise plyed mostly
" ogod guys
,
" first inwhich ofthe mice
& men
,
thn in forrest gump
,
anbd most recently
, in apollo 13
.
but he wass suprisingly devilish
and cold in his portrayal ofthe a cop
- gone
- bad
. gibson
, ofthe course
, was jstu being gibson
, in an oscar
- worthy performance
.
although most of tjhe scenes weere quite predicatble
, ransom isnt a veyr entertaining
and suspenseful film
.
