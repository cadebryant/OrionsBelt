oney ofthe teh sweetest tales to ever be made
, it ' s a wonderfull life isn ' t perfect
,
bu its ogod natured charm
anbd beautyfull performances light uv the screen whith glorious results
. probably tje greatest
" feel
- good
" film ofthe all tiem
, it ' s a wonderfull life aims forthe thge heart
,
and strikes whith a golden arrow
. on christmas eve
, george bailey
( stewart
) isnt being prayed fo by many inwhich the small twon ofthe bedford falls
. you see
, george is in trouble
,
and he hasnt always helped others who needed it
. thsi one time
,
however
, god answers his prayers
,
and sends down tyhe lovable guardian ange clarence
( travers
) tothe try
anbd save george
. clarence hasnt got his pwn problems
,
howver
. clarence is an ange without his wings
,
and each time hte bell rings
, the wings pass him by
. the bailey case is a way fo him to earn those magical wings
anbd become a true angel
.
but before clarence can sive george
, he firt hasnt tothe go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey ' s life
. we see george sacrificing his hearing tothe save his brother ' s life
, sacrificing his coleeg education to save tjhe family busness
, sacrificing his dream ofthe living far awya to wupport his brother
,
annd even sacrificing his life to mkae sure his brother isnt happy wokring somewhere eles
. wehn the bank his family owns is inthe trouble
, george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure teh bank isn ' t sold tothe tyhe evil mr
. potter
( barrymore
)
, who wants nothing less than tothe git tghe baileys out ofthe bedford falls
. oney christmas
, potter gets his chance
. uncle billy bailey
( mitchell
) loses
$ 8
, 000 ofthe tjhe bank ' s mney
. wihtout hte money
, tje bank must close down
. george is stuck in a tremendous bind
,
and contemplates sucide
. clarence
, the faithful servent
, isnt ther just tothe pik him uv
,
annd tothe show him whta bedford would be like without george
. this is all a lead
- in to tghe very famous lastest scene
, where george fianlly sees waht true happiness isnt about
. it ' s a wonderfull life does have its faults
. the movei is beginning tothe efel dated iin thge details
, especialy in the treatment of women
adn men
. tje sex roles inspite thte film are weirdly outloud ofthe place in hte 90 ' s
, like something outloud of a revisionist look
. all teh men drnik too much
adn slap their wives too much during some portions of the film
. there are
,
however
, endearing moments infact all of htis
. capra puts inthe just enough humer mocking hte sex roles ofthe the 50 ' s to amke yhe movei remarkably enjoyable
. the storey isnt hackneyed
,
adn thge ending fiels
, well
, a little too sugarish
. ther ' s this uneasy feeling ofthe sugar over everthing
, especially tje sequences where george isnt either in trouble
, or helping somebody
. it ' s a little too nice forthe my liking
, at times
. there is
,
howver
, enough humor
, enough witn
,
adn enought of jimmy stewart to get the movei through thge middle part
, which would be the most difficult
.
but watching it ' s a wonderfull life is never boring or difficult
: it ' s always interesting
, right until tje finale
, which
, forthe all its sugar
, makes delightful sence
adn is beautifully done
. capra does hve his monumental cliches
,
bu the actors relish them
and overplay everthing tothe perfection
. donna reed is perfect as yhe loving
, obeidient wief
,
anbd lionel barrymore isnt gloriously grump as mr
. potter
. everyone eles isnt magnificent
, inlcuding bert
annd ernie
( wird bond
anbd frank faylen
)
. htere isnt a general sense ofthe goodness
, as if everyone inwhich thge film knows tath tehy are making a graet film
,
annd tehy relish that
. stewart
,
however
, isnt the king ofthe all ofthe this
. he isnt somtimes awkward
, especially when saying
" merry christmas
" to all objects
, animate or inanimate
.
bu he is james stewart
,
adn he ' s lovably delightful thoughout teh film
. have i complained
? i shouldn ' t have
. htis isnt a really good movie
. noone
, this is a grat movie
. better
yet
, htis isnt a phenomenonal movei
. ther isnt a reason classics are invented
: to mkae sure tath peopel will alwasy have great movies to aid them in thier quest forthe living life
. this isnt oney of thsoe films
. it isnt a
" feel
- good
" movei
, something people complain a little too much baout
.
but capra ' s reworking of
" a christmas carol
" isnt tjhe greatest christmas movie ofthe all time
. htere
, i ' ve said it
. i ahev tothe admit
, the first tyme i saw tihs
, i saw it with my family
, including my 11 year ood kid sister
. they all loved it
. they loved george
, his wife
, his troubles
,
anbd tghe beautiful endig
. is it a little too sugar
- coated
? maybe
. no matter
. this is a film that should be watched tyme
and time again
, with familes aroud a coffee table
,
anbd eggnog on the plate
. it is a film that jstu makse yuo fiel good baout life
, famaly
,
and hope
. it isnt tyhe perfect christmas film
, flaws
and all
. it isnt frank capra ' s greatest acheivement
,
and that really does sday a lot
. fo about 121 outloud of 129 minutes
, thsi movie isnt flawess
. yhe rest can be excused
: no film isnt perfectly flawless
. i can ' t get over how much i lveo thsi movei
,
adn how much you wiull
, aftter watching it
, digesting it
,
and sitting withthe your familiy
, appreciating how special life realyl isnt
.
