) tothe try annd savve george
. clarence hasnt got his pwn problems
,
however
. clarence isnt an angel wihtout his wings
, annd each tiem the bell rings
, the wings pass him by

' s life
, sacrificing his college eduction tothe savve tjhe family business

, 000 ofthe the bank
' s money

. george is stuck in a tremendous bind
,
and contemplates sucide
. clarence
, teh faithful servent
, is there just to pik him up
, annd to show him wqat bedford would be like wihtout george
. htis is all a lead
- infact to hte very famous lsat scene
, where george finally sees what true happiness is baout
. it
' s a wonderfull life does have its faults
. tje movei is beginning to efel dated iin the details
, especially iin the treatment of women annd men
. thge sex roles infact the film are weirdly outloud of palce in the 90
' s
, liek something out of a revisionist look
. all the men drnik too much adn slap thier wives too much druing smoe portions ofthe the film
. there are
, howver
, endearing moments inspite all of thsi
. capra puts iin jsut enough humor mocking thge sex roles of the 50
' s tothe mkea tyhe movei remarkably enjoyable
. hte story isnt hackneyed
,
and the endig fiels
, well
, a little too sugarish
. ther
' s this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything
, expecially the sequences where george is eather in trouble
, or helping somebody
. it
' s a littel too nice forthe my liking
, at times
. there isnt
, howver
, anough humer
, anough wit
,
and enought of jimmy stewart to get teh movie through hte middle part
, which woudl be the most difficult
. bu watching it
' s a wonderfull life is never boring or difficult
: it
' s alwasy interesting
, right until tghe finale
, whcih
, forthe all its sugar
, makse delightful sence anbd isnt beautifully done
. capra doens have his monumental cliches
, bu the actors relish them adn overplay everything tothe perfection
. donna reed isnt perfect as the loving
, obeidient wife
, adn lionel barrymore isnt gloriously grump as mr
. potter
. everyone alse is magnificient
, incuding bert
and ernie
( ward bond
and frank faylen
)
. ther isnt a general sence of goodness
, as if everyone inaddition thte film knwos that tehy are mkaing a great film
, adn they relish that
. stewart
, howver
, isnt the king of all ofthe this
. he is somtimes awcward
, expecially wehn saying
" merry christmas
" to all objects
, animate or inanimate
. bu he is james stewart
, annd he
' s lovably delightful
thoughout tjhe film
. hvae i complained
? i shouldn
' t have
. this is a really good movei
. noone
, this is a great movei
. better
yet
, tihs isnt a phenomenal movie
. htere is a reason classics are invented
: to mkea sure thyat peopel will always have graet movies tothe aid them in their quest fo living life
. this is oney ofthe those films
. it is a
" efel
- good
" movei
, something people complain a littel too much baout
.
but capra
' s reworking of
" a christmas carol
" isnt the greatest christmas movei ofthe all time
. ther
, i
' ve said it
. i ahve tothe admiting
, teh firt timne i saw this
, i saw it with my famaly
, includng my 11 yearm old kid sister
. they all loved it
. they loved george
, his wife
, his toubles
, annd the beatiful endig
. isnt it a little too sugar
- coated
? mabye
. no matter
. this is a film that should be watched tiem adn timne again
, with families aroud a coffee table
, adn eggnog onthe tje plate
. it is a film thta jsut mkaes you efel good about life
, family
, adn hope
. it is the perfect christmas film
, flaws
and all
. it isnt frank capra
' s greatest acheivement
,
and tyhat realy does say a lot
. for baout 121 out ofthe 129 minutes
, this movie isnt flawless
. thte rest can be excused
: no film is perfectly flawess
. i can
' t get over how much i love this movie
,
and how much ytou wiull
, after watching it
, digesting it
, anbd sitting withthe your family
, appreciating how special life really isnt
.
