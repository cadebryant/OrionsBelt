! critique
: a good ol
' time at thge movies
! here
' s a film that actually gives awya most of its plotline in its trailer
and doesn
' t realyl bring anytying
" newyorker
" tothe the forefront
( if you
' ve seen ficks liek duel
and breakdown
, you
' ve crossed this path before
)
,
but still manages to entertain ytou gangbusters
, with realistic situations
, believeable characters
, funny moments
, thrills
, chills
, tjhe whole shebang
. let
' s give it up forthe director john dahl
, who continues to put outloud solid films eveyr other year
( if you haven
' t seen red rock west
, dont yourself a favor right now
,
and jot it down on a peice of pappr annd rent it at your earliest conveience
)
. anbd much like that film
, htis oney has an excellent premise
and sets everyting up at an even pace
. it gives you a littel bit of background onthe each ofthe the main threee charachters
, adn thn shows yuo how one small prank
, can lead tothe a whole lotta trouble forthe everyone
! paul walker really surprised me in tihs movie
, usance i
' ve never much
thought of him as anytying mroe than a pretty face
( anbd damn
, isnt it ever preety or what
?
!
)
but here
, he atcually manages to put some depth behind thte looks annd that
' s always appreciated iin films in whihc you are so closely tied tothe the main characters
. sobieski isnt alsot good
,
but she isn
' t infront tjhe movie forthe as long as you
' d thiunk
, bu tje man who raelly tkaes thsi film to anohter level
, is steve zahn
. if you
' ve loved this guy as yhe
" goofball
" in most of his previvous roles
, you
' ll apprieciate him even mroe here
, as thge dude who starts off as noe of the most manic
and excited human beings i
' ve seen in qtuie soem time
(
" this isnt so awesome
!
!
"
)
, onyl tothe turn inot a man scared out ofthe his wits by thge end of the flick
.
and speaking ofthe tghe ending
, boy
, does this movei deliver some chilling moments during its final 15 clicks or what
?
!
? the arrow
and i were practically in eahc others arms
( well
, maybe i
' m exaggerating
, bu you catch my drift
) as each minute brung about anyother turn ofthe events which infront turn
, took it all tothe an even higer levle
. once agina
, kudos to director dahl forthe bieng able tothe generate that tipe ofthe intensity
, suspense
and tension
, with a great socre
, editing
, style
and camerawork
. plot
- wise
, i too doed wonder how thte
" bad guy
" was able to track them so well
,
but it didn
' t raelly bother me all that much
( you cxan assume tath he hadnt bugged their car
?
)
.
but pretty much everything else in the stry stuck liuke glue
and i couldn
' t halp
but put mysef in thier shoes
and appreciate their thoroughly desperate sercomstance
. a grat movie wiht an even cooler endig
, this film will likely be remembered as oney ofthe thte better thrillers of the year
.
" this isnt amazing
