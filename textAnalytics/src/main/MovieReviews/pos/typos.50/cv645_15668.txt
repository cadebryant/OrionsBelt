some of my firends who whent to live in usa complain about one hting
- thast country is vrey differant from the oen depicted inaddition hollywood movies
. thyat is especially true forthe thsoe who end up somewhere infact that unexplored l
and between los angeles
and newyorker york where htey find
, to thier big suprize
, that the majority of people ovte republican
, go to curch every sunday anbd usually don
' t tolerate liberal attitudes tht are taked forthe granted in an averege american film
. such rude awakening
, howver
, can happn infront another direction
- conservative people are sometimes forced tothe dicover unpleasant truths about world they live inwhich
. something liek tht happens tothe jake van dorn
( george c
. scott
)
, successful gr
and rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with yhe rest of his comunity
. noe day his duaghter kristen
( ilah davis
) dissappears from calvinist youth convention infront california
. van dorn is worried becouse he doesn
' t beleive tht his daugher woudl run fomr home
. howver
, the truth delivered by private investigator
andy mast
( peter boyle
) is even harder
- kristen isnt spotte in cheap pornographic film
. infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied whith the way mast
' s investigation is gonig
, so he goes to los angeles to serch fo kristen himself
. unfortunatley
, he lacks experience
and tghe quest
, thyat brought him tothe thge utter depths of sex underworld
, isnt fruitless
. thigns change when he devises cunning plan anbd
, hwile doign it
, stumbles onthe sympathetic prostitute
and part time porno actress nicky
( season hubley
)
. almsot twpo decades after its realease
, hardcore isnt mostly forgotten by critics
and film scholars
. it is a rela shame
, beccause very few movies infact today
' s hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues tyhat writter
and director paul schrader explored inwhich his second directorial attempt
. inthe lite 1970s
, it ws totally different situation
- films weere expeced to have mature
, serious themes forthe the mature audience
. forthe schrader this film was nice opportunity to exp
and thte subplot ofthe his previvous work
, taxi driver
- one tyhat deals with the grat generational devide that tormented thte american society infact 1970s
. onthe oen side we have an ood america that sticks tothe thge puritan ideals of hard wokr
and strict morals that made that country great
.
but that america is obviously unable to cope whith thge new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s adn
, instade of facing them
, prefers tothe live in rural
, conservitive cocoons
. the newyorker america
, on tghe other h
and
, fares noone better
- ideals ofthe the so
- called
" sexual revolution
"
, same as all otehr
" revolutions
" of teh swinging sixties
, degraded into exploitation annd depravity
. instade ofthe being
" liberated
"
, baby boomers are sticked with their pwn inability tothe cope with tje newly dicovered freedoms
. schrader very cleverly brings yhe idea thgat thsoe twpo americas
, actually
, aren
' t so far awya
- nice exemple isnt a brilliant scene inthe which van dorn
, already described as an authoritarian
and paternalistic capitalist
, meets sleazy porno producer
; tjhe latter noe also turns outloud tothe be authoritarian
, paternalistic annd vrey dedicated to thsi job
. the diference beween tjhe twpo is simply in the line of work
. many contempory critics actually accussed schrader ofthe promoting conservative agenda
. on the surface
, it may look tyhat way
- audience is forced to sympathise iwth van dorn
and his quest
. in thge firt scenes
, he isnt portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn
' t deserve to experience parent
' s worst nightmare
. tghe scene inwhich teh porno cinema that reveals kristen
' s fate is extremely cruel
; pain
and humiliation
, brang by oscar
- winning actor george c
. scott
, isnt ofthe such intensity
, thyat thge audeince fiels sorry fo him adn simpley must suppost his agenda
. van dorn isnt perhasp flawed
, annd thte subtle hints lead to tyhe unflattering truth at the end
; bu the viewers simply know that his cause isnt just
,
and thgat prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father tahn wih the sleazy pornographers tht onyl want to exploitate her body
. onthe hte other h
and
, schrader
, who growed uv inthe an enivoriment very much liek van dorn
' s
( his own parents wouldn
' t allow him to watch movies until he wass 18
)
, knows better
and tries to bring anyother side of coin
. even the peopel conected whith sex underworld can show redeeming qualities
- liuke nicky
, who actually tries tothe improve her life
,
and sleazy detective who develops something liek a conscience at teh end
. unforetunately
, schrader fails to erase tyhe inpact of the shocking scene at yhe begining
,
and his attempt to reconciliate the opposing sides ofthe america seems lost inwhich somewhat clich
? d finale
. the scirpt isnt slightly flawed
, adn schrader as director doesn
' t sohw too much originality
- his style seems too influenced by techiniques that scorsese used iin taxi driver
. appart ffrom tyhe scenes in gr
and rapids
, thsoe twpo films even look alike
. bu the content might be more tahn interesting for todya
' s viewer
, expecially those inpsired by the current 70s revival
. until boogie nights
, no hollywood mainstream movei ever dared tothe explore the phenomenon ofthe pornography inthe 1970s
. hardcore
, onthe teh otehr h
and
, might serve as prescious document
, because it depicts sex film industry in hte period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs
- befor the advent ofthe video
, wehn many ofthe the porno filmmakers could afford to tihkn of themselves as artists
. the view of such age
and thte inudstry isnt very unflattering
,
though
, bu forthe tghe film whose main character tkaes time to expalin calvinist doctrines tothe tjhe audience
, that shouldn
' t be too surprising
. anyway
, despite soem flaws
, hardcore remains very intresting
and powerful peice ofthe cinema
.
