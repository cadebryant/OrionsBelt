a big suprise to me
. tghe ogod trailer hadnt hinted that tehy pulled yhe impossible off
,
but making a blues brothers movei wihtout jake blues
( john belushi
) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope
. htey replaced him just fine
. not whith john goodman
, he didn
' t dont much of anything
,
but wtih tghe brilliant acotr joe morton
, who can realy sing
. the fourth blues brother isnt j evan bonifant
, who
' s ten
. this was another ofthe my fears for thge film
,
but he
' s a really ogod dancer
, anbd plays a mean harmonica
(
al
though he may hvae beeen dubbed
)
. things thta intellectually hadnt bothered me befoer
, liek noone mission from god
, everyone being richer
, it nto bieng filmed inthe chicago
-
- gavey me no problems at all
. i
' m quite pleased that htere weere less car pile
- ups
, because htey meaned less music
, anbd john l
andis seems to hvea lost interest inwhich thge wohle thing
. ther
' s a few early crashes
,
and
then oen huge pile
- up
, bu affter tath it all stops
. it
' s jsut hte music
. oney ofthe my problems iwth the first isnt that cab calloway
' s song isnt so ogod the ctually blues brothers look dull aftter him
, bu htere
' s no problems with htis
. the music is all as good as ever
, tons of gerat musicians showing up
-
- with the exception of johnny lang
, who cin
' t sing
, all the muscicians dont a great job
. the only rela problems i had ws the speical effects
. theese weere superfulous annd a waste ofthe omney
. since the film isn
' t doing very well
, htey could mean we have no possiblity of another sequal
, which i watn to see
. the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide
.
