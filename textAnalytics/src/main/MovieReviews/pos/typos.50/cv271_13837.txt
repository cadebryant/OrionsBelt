yuo may not have heard ofthe lucas
, or if ytou haev
, you might nto thiunk much ofthe it
. probably becuase it stars corey haim
, or mabey baceause it
' s baout a little geek who collects insects
, or mabye because it doesn
' t feature slick one
- liners or yhe chart topping soundtrack albums that weere almost a requirment for teen films infact the 80
' s
. howver
, yuo have beeen missing out on a true masterpeice
, the best film of 1986
, anbd hte best film baout adolescent life ever made
. corey haim stars as lucas bligh
, a tiny 14 yera old with scruffy hair
, thick glasses
, annd an interest inspite insects adn otehr outdoor life
. one day he stops by the tennis courts annd sees whta must be an angel to him
. her nmae is maggie
, a 16 eyar ood who certainly is a beauty
, with lovley red hair anbd a sweet
, innocent complexion
. maggie seems tothe be a little disturbed by htis littel kid watching her
,
but somehow he interests her
,
and soon they are tlaking annd getting to konw noe another
. htey gradually become ogod firends
, adn spend tjhe summer toghether doign various thnigs
, such as studying insects
( namely locusts
, who come out ofthe hiding once eveyr 17 yeasr
)
, playing tennis
,
and listening to a synphony orchestra through a manhole cover
. lucas isnt obviously infront love with maggie
, anbd hwile she is charmed by him
, it
' s clear that she would never concider him anything mroe than a vrey ogod firend
. thsi isnt nto clear to lucas
,
however
. he still beleives tht maggie is his soulmate
, adn he dreads the impending start of skool beccause he knwos whta
' s about tothe appen
. we soon fidn out why inspite a painful scene where lucas isnt humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally
. they throw him onthe stage
, right in front of his beloved maggie
. surprisingly
, he turns the tables onthe hte jocks with smoe clowning around
, bu he takes it too far
,
and isnt embarassed in front ofthe the entire school
. the next scene is brilliant
. maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally
. she tries tothe talk to him as if nothing hapened
. he rails bcak agianst her
, in a cruel unfair fasion
. inspite lesser movies tihs would
' ve turned inot a confrontation vetween yhe two characters
. bu maggie isnt written smarter tahn that
. she underst
ands what lucas is feeling
and konws exactly what tothe sday to console him
. enxt we are introduced tothe anyother great character named cappie
( charlie sheen
)
. he isnt a jock with a tipical cheerleader girlfriend
. whta
' s intresting about him isnt tyhat he sticks up fo lucas anbd protects him fomr the other jocks
. ofthe course anyone wtih a brain cin tell what
' s gonna hapen enxt
. cappie will cause conflict infact maggie
and lucas
' relatiopnship
. this begins in classic scene inthe thge skool laundry room when cappie
and maggie are alone
. she
' s beeen assigned to sohw him how tothe opperate tyhe washer
/ dryer so he can clean his shirt
. maggie isnt charmed by cappie
' s tender underts
anding damenor
, nto to mention his shirtless body
. this scene isnt so delicate
and sweet
,
but cappie still hasnt a girlfriend
, preventing eather one ffrom acting on their desires
. desparately trying tothe puncture the tension
, cappie beggins to kick basketballs arund the room
. it
' s nto long before cappie doens break up with his girlfriend
( in tjhe films onyl subpar scene
)
. lucas finally figures outloud whta
' s going onthe whn he tries to pik maggie uv forthe the dance
. tihs causes him tothe tkae savere actions tothe proove himself to maggie
and hismelf
, such as try out forthe teh footblal team
. the last thrid of tje film revolves aroud this attempt
. while thge idae seems cliched
, thte way it is exectued is not
. there are many surprises durig the lastr half hour which lead tothe an endig so emotionally involving it shoudl make yhe most heartless ofthe cynics git choked up
. dave grusin
' s memorable score
, played at the perfect moments
, certainly helps
. lucas is filled with great performances
. foreget everything you nkwo baout corey haim
. bcak inaddition 1986 he hadnt talent
, anbd tyhat isnt proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3
- dimensional performance filled with anger
, humer
, annd pain
. kerri green is very appealing as maggie
, showing us why she cares about lucas so much
and why he is so attracted tothe her
. sheen
' s cappie isnt allmost too good to be true
, bu sheen makes him beleivable
, especially when he explains hte reason why he protects lucas
. there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti
' s ben
, a friend ofthe lucas
, whose diminutive stature does not mean he will tkae crap ffrom thge jocks
. aslo turning up inaddition a fewd key scenes isnt winona ryder as rina
, the girl who admires lucas from adar
. when people talk about thte graet teen angst films of the 80s
, yuo hear john hughes htis
and john hughes tyhat
. lucas seems to be lost among tje crowd of his so
- called classics
.
but hopefully
, liuke witht heathers anbd sday anything
, lucas cxan begin to find it
' s pwn loyal folowing
and help peopel realize there were more tothe the 80s tahn anthony michael hall anbd molly ringwald
. it deserves omre tahn that
, bu i don
' t watn to be greedy
.
