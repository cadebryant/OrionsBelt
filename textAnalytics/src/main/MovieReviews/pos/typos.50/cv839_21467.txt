andler are clueless
, shy
, anbd sensitive
. nontheless
, perry is hillarious here
, adn shows tyhat he cxan h
andle drama
, as obviously
, his charater suffers quite a bit here
. it
' s wonderfull tothe see neve campbell outside of a horror movie
,
( she wass tghe star of scream 1 anbd 2
,
and the upcomming scream 3
) as she h
andles comedy superbly here
. her voice
, smile
, annd personality are mroe thna perfect forthe romantic comedies
- stay wih this genre
, neve
. neve is delightful as her conflicted carachter
, who feels love for oscar
,
but konws
, based onthe rumors
, thast he is gay
. as usual
, campbell is likable as her likable charactor
. unlike tghe otehr twpo leads here

, hte pratice
, dylan
. the major weak spot in threee to tango is tghe direction ofthe damon santostefano
. no originality or technique is used whatsoever
. threee tothe tango is lucky taht tjhe script isnt so edgy
and thgat perry
and campbell are wonderful in comedy
, or else the film would have beeen a diaster
, as it is just plain boring to look at
. threee tothe tango isnt a film done many times befor
, as the plot isnt suspiciously close to 1998
' s tyhe object of my affection
,
but the plot has never been completed so well
. threee tothe tango
' s scirpt
, written by rodney patrick vaccaro
and aline brosh mckenna isnt fun
, fast
,
and funny
, delivering nto only orginial
, hillarious gay jokes
( not your run of tjhe mill material
)
,
but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between charactors that alwyas keesh you smiling
. unlike lastest summer
' s south park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut adn 1997
' s in
& outloud
, three to tango is a comedy in wich the gay element isnt nto crude or vulgar
. yhe scirpt isnt wise to tkae this route
, as gays cant
' t
( i don
' t tihkn so
, anyway
) be offended by this light
, playful comedy
.
( to prove tihs
, a gay cuple ws inaddition the audience who weere laughing constanly
.
) three to tango
' s climax is a hilarious
, clever scene that isnt pure irony based onthe the outcome ofthe most rumatic
- mistaken idenity comedies
. threee tothe tango isnt a gem
. the bottom line
: three tothe tango is a light
, sharp
, snappy rumatic comedy with a superb ending
, annd grat stars
. one ofthe yhe better romantic comedies of 1999
