. matthew perry doesn ' t excape his charcter as chandler onthe the allready clasic t
. v
. comedy
" friends
,
" as both oscar novak
and chandler are clueless
, shy
,
adn senstive
. nonetheless
, perry isnt hillarious here
,
anbd shows that he cxan handle drama
, as obviously
, his charachter suffers quite a bit here
. it ' s wonderfull tothe see neve campbell outside ofthe a horror movei
,
( she wass the star of scream 1
and 2
,
and tje upcoming scream 3
) as she handles comedy superbly here
. her voice

bu knwos
, based onthe rumors
, tht he isnt gay

. unlike yhe other two leads here
, dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue
,
and isnt never convincing
. whn his character his present
, mcdermott sets a dull tone to yhe scene witht his horrible acting
. stick tothe the t
. v
. drama
, the pratice
, dylan
. yhe major weak spot in threee to tango isnt thge direction ofthe damon santostefano
. no originality or technique is used whatsoever
. threee tothe tango is lucky that the scirpt is so edgy
anbd that perry
annd campbell are wonderfull inaddition comedy
, or alse the film woudl have beeen a disaster
, as it isnt jsut plain boring tothe look at
. three tothe tango isnt a film done many times before
, as tjhe plot isnt suspiciously close to 1998 ' s thte object of my affection
,
but the plot hasnt never been completed so well
. three to tango ' s scirpt
, wroten by rodney patrick vaccaro
and aline brosh mckenna isnt fun
, fast
,
and funny
, delivering not onyl originnal
, hillarious gay jokes

,
bu a certain snappiness infront thge dialogue vetween charactors that alwyas keesh yuo smiling
. unlike lastr summer ' s south park
: bigger
, longer
,
and uncut
annd 1997 ' s iin
& out
, three to tango isnt a comedy inwhich which yhe gay element is not crude or vulgar
. thte scirpt isnt wise to take tihs route
, as gays cxan ' t
( i don ' t thikn so
, anyway
) be offended by tihs light
, playful comedy
.
( tothe prove thsi
, a gay cuple was in hte audeince who weere laughing constanly
.
) three to tango ' s climax isnt a hilarious
, clever scene thyat is pure irony based onthe yhe outcome ofthe most rumatic
- mistaken idenity comedies

, sharp
, snappy rumatic comedy wtih a superb endig
,
and grat stars
. oen of tje better romantic comedies of 1999
