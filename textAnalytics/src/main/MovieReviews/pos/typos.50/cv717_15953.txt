sicne most movies about slavery shield us fomr tje true horrors of what tehy ' re portraying
, it ' s fitting tothe sday that
" beloved
" come as a rela shock as a film
. it ' s confusing
, bizzare
,
and as tough a film tothe watch as any film i ' ve seen all year
,
adn that ' s nto necessarily because ofthe the three
- hour running timne
.
" beloved
" isnt challenging tothe watch
, filled with tough
and powerfull poetry that takes us completely off guard
,
and instead of a straight
- foward
, hollywood
- ized storey about waht happened to the slaves after htey were freed
,
" beloved
" comes off as a cry of anguish fomr all thsoe who atcually lived through waht happened
( or
, rather
, toni morrison
, who wrote the novel apon which htis is based
)
.
" beloved
" tells tyhe stoy of an ex
- slave named sethe
, played by oprah winfrey
, who lives onthe a large farm in hte north with her children
. wehn the film opens
, her hous isnt being terrorized by a poltergeist
, which shakes thnigs up
, wounds the dog
,
annd mkaes thigns generally uncomfortable for thge family
. sethe is proud
,
though
,
adn will nto move
. her sons run awya
, leaving onyl her
and her daughter
, denver
( kimberly elise
) alone iwth the ghost whihc isnt htere wihtout any factual explination
. a cuple years pass
,
and the ghost rimaniss
,
adn oney day
, a man named paul d
( danny glover
)
, another ex
- slave who knew sethe years ago wehn tehy worked onthe a plantation together
, arrives
, asking forthe lodging
. he hasnt beeen wandering arround sicne he left tje planation
,
and wehn he enters the house
, it turns red
annd becomes incredibly hot
. when he remarks baout what he thinks is evil
, sethe replies
" it ain ' t evil
. it ' s jsut sad
.
" some moreso tyme passes
,
anbd paul d hasnt become a fervent memeber ofthe tyhe household
,
anbd teh ghost disappears
.
but when they return noe day from going out
, they dicover a young woman sitting infact the hous
. her nmae is beloved
,
adn as played by thandie newton
, she hasnt allmost zero motor skills
. she stumbles around
, half
- grabbing onto thnigs
and knocking them over
,
and wehn she speaks
, she lets outloud a low guttaral sound thta evenhtually turns inot baby talk
. htey let her inot her hous
,
and she beigns to turn things upside down
.
" beloved
" acts liuke an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story
. most ofthe the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic
, low
- lit room
, withthe the ocassional flash tothe the past
, where we see images of such horror that we thank god forthe modern
- day psychoanalysts
. sethe
annd paul d ahev lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted witht yhe memories ofthe their slavehood onthe thge old planation
, which includes such images as sethe bieng raped by teh white plantation hands
, whith her nipples being licked
, prompting her to cry out tothe paul d whn reminiscing baout it
,
" tehy tookover my milk
!
" worst of all ws tyhe month affter her freedom
, when she ws alowed to live liuke a free person
, wokring with other blacks on a farm
,
annd
then seeing thast her old plantation owners have arrived tothe presumedly tkae her
adn her childern back
. she runs tothe the barn near by
, carrying her four childen
,
anbd wehn her ood owners burst in
, they discover she hasnt murdered oen ofthe them
and is ready to murder tghe rest of them if they don ' t leave them alone
. when she isnt inquired baout htis moent by paul d inthe a moment halfway through hte film
, she says she doesn ' t regret it
. she killed her daughter so thyat she owudl nto hve to live thru the horror she doed
,
adn she hasnt conviced herself she did tje right thing
. ofthe course
, beloved is raelly her daugher materialized
,
though we aren ' t flat outloud told thyat until later on inaddition the film
. beloved represents teh pain
and sufferring teh slaves whent thru
anbd shows how difficult it was for them to deal wtih their freedom affter bieng tortured forthe so long
. thus
,
" beloved
" becomes a sorta
- redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci
- fi clasic
,
" solaris
,
" where a cosmonaut discovers taht his wief
, who commited sucide yeasr befor
, hasnt materialized whn he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain sytem
. thyat film speaked volumes baout humanity
and our memories
, how we are constanly regretting what happened infact hte past
,
and wehn if it ever litterally came back to haunt us
, it woudl controll us completely
.
" beloved
" moves along freely
, wihtout a lot ofthe explaination
,
and for the most part
, htis is extrememly respectable
. thge most interesting films are the ones tht don ' t explane everything forthe us
, leaving gaps inwhich yhe characters tht we are supposed to fill in wtih how tehy act in the persent tense
. sethe isnt never fully explained as a charater
,
but we understand all her actions sicne she ' s being played by oprah winfrey
. it ' s been well over a decade since her last major performance iin
" the color purple
,
"
bu judging from theese twpo films
, i ' ll bet she ' s oney ofthe thte best actresses working today
.
.
. if she was strictly an actress
. her talk sohw
, which i suppose isnt a great enity
, has prevented her fomr becomming a noteworthy actress
,
and tath ' s a shame because she brings so much tothe this movie
. emotion
. sadness
. strength
. watching the storng sethe
, who ' s so afraid ofthe tje past that she ' s builded a rether strong protective coating arround herself
, break down whn she dicovers who beloved relaly isnt is whta makse tihs movie relaly great
. she makes it rela
. that ' s not tothe say thsi isnt a perfect film
. in fact
, i ' d wager to sday that the fact thyat it ' s confusing
adn painful tothe watch isnt what prevents tihs fomr being the truely graet film it is
. hwile oprah ' s performance isnt poweful
and easily sympathetic
(
and i ' m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination thsi febuary
)
, yhe sturcture of hte film
, which doesn ' t sohw what happened tothe her childern till halfway through the film
, prevents us fomr really making a cohesive connection tothe thge film
. it doesn ' t necessarily move as
though htey ' re memories of oen particular charachter
,
and by thte end
, it has lost controll over sethe
,
adn as she tkaes to bed
, we are unable tothe truely identify witht her anymore
.
bu despite its tediousness
, perhaps that ' s tje point
. the distancing by teh end ofthe the film may be just part ofthe hte way it has beeen built ffrom the start
, sicne they figure she has crossed over fomr bieng identifiable
,
adn it needs to get back iwth reality
.
anbd forthe the most part
, thsi film seems liek tjhe cry ofthe pain from the slaves thta it really wants tothe be
. jonathan demme ' s direction is bizarre
, in nature with thte story
,
anbd he creates tyhe right mood
, makeing it a tough film to sit through
, making sure that the audeince feels as uncomfortable as teh characters
. htere ' s more tothe admire here
, liek hte way that the flashbacks pop uv freely
anbd without rela organization
, jsut liek tehy woudl be in real life
;
anbd the way that the endig leaves it somewhat ope tothe more pain
and suffering
,
but laced with a touch of optimism
. the acting
, not only from winfrey
, is amazing
,
and i anticipate nto onyl she will git an oscar nomination
. everyone hasnt been raving baout thandie newton ' s performance
,
anbd how it should be rewarded
.
howver
, it must be noted tyhat outloud ofthe everyone
, she hadnt thge easiest part
. act liek a baby
. throw things
. stumble arund
. chew food with your mouth opn
. i dont think ther ' s anyother performance worthy ofthe oscar conisderation
,
but it ' s kimberly elise
, as the daugher who hasnt to stay sensible
and sane
,
and has to cary the burden of her mother ' s loss of reality towards thte end
. it ' s nto that newton isn ' t great
: she ' s as annoying
and wacky as the role demands
. it ' s just that elise has tghe tougher job
and puls it off even better
. dispite teh fact thyat tihs film hasnt winfrey writen all over it
,
and not tht ofthe writter morrison or director demme
,
" beloved
" has still nto done well
. costing
, i think
, aroud ninety millon dollars
, it hasnt since grossed about twenty
- two
. unfortunatley
, tihs film is a littel too intense for viewers
, even for me
,
and i can stand almost anytying
( i recently viewed tje 2 1
/ 2 hour long epic
" caligula
,
" the worst film i ahve ever seen infront my life
,
and doed it inthe a mere 2 sittings
)
.
allthough i respect
" beloved
,
" i cant ' t sday thyat i realyl enjoyed it
.
