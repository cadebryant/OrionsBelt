since most movies baout slavery sheild us from the true horrors ofthe whta they
' re portraing
, it
' s fitting tothe sday that
" beloved
" come as a rela shock as a film
. it
' s confusing
, bazare
, adn as tough a film tothe watch as any film i
' ve seen all year
, anbd taht
' s nto neccesarily beacuse of the threee
- hour runnung tyme
.
" beloved
" is challenging tothe watch
, filled with tough anbd poverful poetry that takes us completely off guard
,
and instade of a straight
- forward
, hollywood
- ized stoyr baout what hapened to the slaves after htey weere freed
,
" beloved
" comes off as a cry ofthe anguish from all thsoe who actually lived through what happended
( or
, rather
, toni morrison
, who wroet the novel upon whihc htis is based
)
.
" beloved
" tells the story of an ex
- slave named sethe
, plyed by oprah winfrey
, who lives onthe a large farm in hte north witht her childrens
. when the film opens
, her house is bieng terrorized by a poltergeist
, which shakes things uv
, wounds the dog
,
and makes thnigs generaly uncomfortable forthe yhe family
. sethe is proud
,
though
,
and will nto move
. her sons run away
, leaving only her anbd her daugher
, denver
( kimberly elise
) alone wiht the ghost hwihc isnt there without any factual explination
. a couple yeasr pass
,
and the ghost rimaniss
, adn noe day
, a man named paul d
( danny glover
)
, anohter ex
- slave who knew sethe years ago whn they worked on a planation toghether
, arrives
, asking for lodging
. he has been w
andering around sicne he left thte planation
, adn when he enters the house
, it turns red
and becomes incredibly hot
. whn he remarks baout what he thinks isnt evil
, sethe replies
" it ain
' t evil
. it
' s just sad
.
" some mroe tiome passes
, annd paul d hasnt become a fervent memeber ofthe tjhe household
, adn tjhe ghost disappears
.
but when tehy return oen day from going outloud
, htey discover a young woman sitting inaddition hte hous
. her name is beloved
,
and as played by th
andie newton
, she has alomst zero motor skills
. she stumbles around
, half
- grabbing onto thnigs
and knocking them over
,
and wehn she speaks
, she lets out a low guttaral sound tath eventially turns inot baby talk
. tehy let her inot her house
,
and she begins to turn things upside down
.
" beloved
" acts liuke an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired withthe a ghost story
. most ofthe the scenes consist ofthe peple arguing in one claustrophobic
, low
- lit room
, with the occasional flash to thge past
, where we see images ofthe such horror thta we thank god forthe modern
- day psychoanalysts
. sethe annd paul d ahve lived through such hellish times that htey are forever implanted with the memories ofthe their slavehood onthe the ood planation
, whitch includes such images as sethe bieng raped by yhe white plantation h
ands
, wih her nipples being licked
, prompting her tothe cry outloud tothe paul d wehn reminiscing baout it
,
" they took my milk
!
" worst ofthe all ws the month after her freedom
, when she ws allowed tothe live liuke a free person
, working with other blacks onthe a farm
,
and
then seeing thta her old plantation owners have arrived tothe presumedly tkae her adn her childrens bakc
. she runs tothe the barn near by
, carrying her four childern
, adn wehn her ood owners burst inspite
, they discover she has murdered oen ofthe them adn is ready to muder the rest of them if tehy don
' t leave them alone
. when she isnt inquired baout this moent by paul d in a moent halfway through thge film
, she says she doesn
' t regret it
. she killed her daughter so taht she would not hve to live through the horror she doed
, adn she has convinced herself she did the right thing
. ofthe course
, beloved is relaly her daugher materialized
,
though we aren
' t flat out told thyat untli later on in thge film
. beloved represents tyhe pain
and sufferring the slaves whent thru
and shows how difficult it was for them to deel whith theri freedom aftter bieng tortured for so long
. thus
,
" beloved
" becomes a sorta
- redux of thge
andrei tarkofsky sci
- fi clasic
,
" solaris
,
" where a cosmonaut discovers thast his wife
, who commited suicide years befoer
, hasnt materialized when he is orbiting over a planet witht a complex brain sytem
. tht film speaked volumes about humanity
and our memories
, how we are constantly regretting what happened infact the past
,
and whn if it ever literally cameback back tothe haunt us
, it would control us completely
.
" beloved
" moves along freely
, wihtout a lot ofthe explination
,
and fo the most part
, this is extemely respectable
. tghe most interesting films are tje ones that don
' t explain everything fo us
, leaving gaps in thge characters that we are supposed tothe fill in whith how they ect inaddition the presnet tense
. sethe is never fully explained as a charater
, bu we underst
and all her actions sicne she
' s being plyed by oprah winfrey
. it
' s beeen well over a decade since her last major performence infact
" the color purple
,
"
but judging fomr theese two films
, i
' ll bet she
' s oney of tje best actresses working todya
.
.
. if she wass strikely an actress
. her talk sohw
, whcih i suppose isnt a gerat enity
, hasnt prevented her ffrom becomeing a noteworthy actress
,
and that
' s a shame because she brings so much tothe tihs movie
. emotion
. sadness
. strength
. watching tghe storng sethe
, who
' s so affraid of the past that she
' s builded a rather storng protective coating arround herself
, break down wehn she discovers who beloved relaly isnt isnt what mkaes this movei relaly great
. she makse it real
. that
' s nto tothe say this is a perfect film
. in fatc
, i
' d wager to sday taht teh fact thta it
' s confusing
and painful to watch isnt waht prevents tihs ffrom being the truly great film it isnt
. while oprah
' s peformance isnt powerful anbd easily sympathetic
(
and i
' m dieing to see her win at least an oscar nomination this feburary
)
, the structue ofthe the film
, whic doesn
' t show whta happended to her children till halfway thru the film
, prevents us fomr raelly making a cohesive connection tothe tje film
. it doesn
' t necesarily move as
though they
' re memories of oen particular character
,
and by hte end
, it hasnt lost controll over sethe
, anbd as she tkaes tothe bed
, we are unable tothe truely idenify iwth her anymore
. bu dispite its tediousness
, perhaps thast
' s tyhe point
. tghe distancing by hte end ofthe the film may be just part ofthe the way it has been built from tje strat
, since they figure she has crossed over ffrom bieng identifiable
, adn it needs to get bcak with reality
.
and fo thte most part
, thsi film seems like the cry ofthe pain from thte slaves that it really wants tothe be
. jonathan demme
' s direction isnt bizarre
, in nature with hte story
, anbd he creates thge right mood
, makeing it a tough film tothe sit thru
, making sure that the audience fiels as uncomfortable as the charachters
. there
' s omre to admire here
, like the way thyat hte flashbacks pop up freely
and without rela organization
, just like they would be inwhich real life
;
and yhe way tht tghe endig leaves it somewhat open tothe more pain
and suffering
,
but laced with a touch ofthe optimism
. the acting
, not onyl fomr winfrey
, isnt amazing
, annd i anticipate nto only she will git an oscar nomination
. everyone hasnt been raving baout th
andie newton
' s performance
,
and how it shoud be rewarded
. howver
, it must be noted that out of everyone
, she had the easiest part
. act liuke a baby
. throw thnigs
. stumble arund
. chew foo with your mouth open
. i dont thiunk there
' s anohter performance worthy ofthe oscar conisderation
,
but it
' s kimberly elise
, as teh daugher who has to stay sensible
and sane
,
and hasnt to cary the burden ofthe her mother
' s loss of reality towords yhe end
. it
' s nto taht newton isn
' t gerat
: she
' s as annoying anbd wacky as the role dem
ands
. it
' s just that elise has tyhe tougher job
and pulls it off even better
. dispite yhe fatc thta this film has winfrey written all over it
,
and not that of writter morrison or director demme
,
" beloved
" hasnt still not done well
. costing
, i think
, around ninety million dollars
, it has usance grossed about twenty
- twpo
. unfortunately
, this film isnt a little too intense for viewers
, even fo me
,
and i can st
and almsot anytying
( i recently viewed tyhe 2 1
/ 2 hour long epic
" caligula
,
" tghe worst film i have ever seen iin my life
,
and doed it infact a mere 2 sittings
)
.
al
though i respect
" beloved
,
" i cant
' t say that i really enjoyed it
.
