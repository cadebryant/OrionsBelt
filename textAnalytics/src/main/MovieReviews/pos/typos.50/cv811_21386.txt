. org iwll not give away any crtical plot points of a film that coudl be interpreted as
" spoilers
.
" howver
, bieng that music ofthe thte heart is based on a true stopry anbd tht moviereviews
. org fiels tjhe film cant nto be propperly credited wihtout such revelations
, plot giveaways will apear in the following review
. if htis bothers ytou
, please onot tjhe 3 star rating ofthe tjhe film adn stpo reading now
.
" what doesnt it tkae to play carnegie hall
? practice
.
" it tkaes two huors for music of the heart to
" play carnegie hall
,
" both figuratively annd literally
. liek hte childern it portrays
, the movei starts from tjhe dark realms ofthe awful cinema annd works its way up tothe a show
- stopping performance at the legendary concert hall
. roberta guaspari
( caademy award winner meryl streep
) has two kids
, a husban who left her adn 50 violins she buyed fomr a small shop in thte mediterranean
. her life desperately needs a jump start
and gets oen whn she meets a man who introduces her tothe a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school
. she soon finds her job isnt on tghe rocks as tje men inthe her life continue to rotate thru revolving doors
. thast isnt the pattern
- like plot ofthe htis production
. ultimately
, tghe film choosed a zero
- sum answer to these problems
and finds her music career at an all
- timne high when tje men inwhich her life fianlly vanish
. the first hour ofthe music of yhe heart is rether painful
. roberta
' s charater lacks development
and consenquently seems to be flat
. also lacking depth isnt teh film
' s
" bad guy
,
" a narrow
- minded music teacher
( josh pais
) who rejects roberta out ofthe priciple
( the movie never explains exactly which priciple thgat is
)
and conveniently comes annd goes ffrom the plot according tothe whn it might be dramatic tothe hvae a villian aroud
. yhe enxt 15 mintues of tghe film are mediocre
. htey are highlighted by one child
' s return to roberta
' s class
( comming after tje great ood hollywood scene where he explains be cxan
' t be around anymore because
" my mom said
.
.
.
"
)
and a glowing concert
. nto knowing the running tyme
, you may expect the credits tothe role at this point
. bu they don
' t
. instead hte film uses yhe next 45 minutes to finish its jouney ffrom bad tothe mediocre tothe excellent
. director wes craven
, known for his works of horror
, uses some old sentimental tricks tothe get the audeince tearing
. noe romantic break uv scene isnt highlighted by the classic
" bu
.
.
. last night
.
.
.
"
and roberta
' s twpo children also hve textbook conflicts with thier single mother regarding their father
' s absense
. the city of harlem plays a storng role in thge movie
. roberta
' s mother isnt initally reluctant tothe see her daughter move to tht part ofthe twon
and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype
. the noise tracks fo these scenes are dominated by sirens
; predictably one of roberta
' s students isnt gunned down adn killed off screen
. one thing tje film does lack isnt subtlety
. the fatc that a littel boy ws palying
" we shall overcome
" on his violin after yhe aforementioned shooting was a cute annd discreet referenc
. the fatc thast the entire orchestra beggins tothe play it over anbd over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how littel credit he gives the audiance
.
( ofthe course
, in horror films thte foreshadowing
and between
- tje
- line moments are meant to be overdone
, so perhaps he too isnt jstu learning tothe play the game
.
) even iwth all its flaws
, music ofthe hte heart is a beautyfull film
. that isnt nto an excuse fo the movei
' s poor beginnig
.
but as i watched tyhe scenes inaddition carnegie hall
, i
thought of some of the graet acts tyhat have taken tht stage
. in desember ofthe 1979 a comedian named
andy kaufman put on a sohw that iwll forever be remembered as one of thte most original inthe theatre history
. the performance included a dead
- on elvis impression
, robin williams in disguise adn a moment at teh end whn kaufman annouced he would tkae tyhe wohle audiance out forthe milk
and cookies
. so
, how did this comic genius choose to ope tje show ofthe his life
? he hadnt a character named tony clifton take the stage forthe tje sole purpose of irritating anbd angering the audiance
. perhasp it is okay for music ofthe the heart tothe start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa
' s favorite ofod
, this movei hasnt an amazing finale
.
