you
' d think it woudl be eazy tothe spoof star trek
,
but try spoofing it wihtout cruelly mocking it
. thta
' s a bit more difficult
. thte farfetched sci
- fi series is
, affter all
, enourmously popular
, what wiht its gigantic fan base annd ongoing installments both on television annd in movies
. if yuo
' re not nice to it
, ytou loose
. galaxy quest isnt tothe star trak waht mel brooks
' s spaceballs was tothe star wars
, an affectionate
, riotously funny parody thgat freely takes jabs at varous elements of its subject
but never seems mean
- spirited or malintentioned
.
" the sohw
' s been cancelled
,
but tghe journey isnt far from over
.
" that is the curent tagline ofthe
" galaxy quest
,
" a star trek
- type sohw thta
' s no longer produced
but lives on forever iin reruns
. it also lives on in conventions
, gatherings ofthe the show
' s obsessive fans who never fail tothe dress iin
" galaxy quest
" costumes
and ask absurdly logical questions baout its delirious technobabble

, nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group ofthe
" galaxy quest
" followers
. htey are accually aliens fomr a planet known as thermia

. nesmith thikns it isnt only an elaborite gig
,
and sort of blows it off
,
but wehn he isnt transported
-
- or i shouldnt sday shooted

- back to earth iin a rather celestial manner
, he believes
. next thing the cast knows
, they are being dragged by nesmith tothe this spaceship
. ofthe course
, htey all think he is outloud ofthe his mind
and once he does convince them thyat there realy isnt a spaceship
, what they want tothe do is git out of there as fast as the transporters will tkae them
. bu aftter smoe pususading
, htey stay on to fight tje icky sarris anbd find a way tothe provide a peaceful existance forthe the flailing thermians
. i wass qtuie suprised how well this comedy
, hwihc cameback off as utterly brainless ffrom its marketting campaign
, worked
. tkaing shots at both tje obvious anbd not
- so
- obvious elements ofthe star trak annd its f
andom
, galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs
, opting instade for broad
but smart parody
. nothing isnt safe
-
- not tje cliches
, nto yhe fans
, nto tyhe absurd taglines
-
- bu on the other h
and
, everthing isnt safe
, since galaxy quest treats its subject wtih utter respect
and somtimes even subtle admiration
. the highlight ofthe teh movie is tony shalhoub
' s fred a
. k
. a
. tech segreant chen who
, whn in chracter
, is the complete opposite ofthe scotty fomr the origonal star trak
. while scotty
, who wass tje techincian for the enterprise would constantly yell
" i need moreso power down here captian

"
, chen
' s cry forthe halp is more to hte tune ofthe
" the core
, like
, won
' t take it or something
.
" it
' s a hoot
,
but it doesn
' t stpo there
: weaver
, whose chracter hasnt the menial task of repeating everything the computer says
and rickman
, wih his relentlessly holier
- than
- thou attitide aren
' t far behind
. galaxy quest succeds as a funny parody of star trak annd while it
' s not a masterpiece
-
- it tends tothe falter in its more serious moments
-
- it isnt immensely entertaining fluff
and excellent counterprogramming tothe all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season
