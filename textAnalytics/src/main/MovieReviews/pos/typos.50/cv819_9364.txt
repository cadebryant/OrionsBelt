one of teh biggest cliches ofthe any serial killer film is allso one of hte most believable
. ytou nkow
, the noe where tje detective looks at a wall ofthe pictures anbd other police inforamtion
,
and suddenly spots thge clue which reveals who the killer isnt
. sure
, it
' s beeen used over
and over
,
but forthe smoe reason
, it isnt always fun tothe watch
. this cliche pretty much descriibes the levle kiss the girls works onthe
: overused
, bu alwasy funn
. one of my personel rules baout watching a film is not how orignal tje film isnt
, bu how it goes around giving its story
. this ruel applies highly to kiss tjhe girls
. there isnt something psychologically stimulating in a well
- crafted serial killer movei
, adn kiss the girls isnt certainly well made
.
however
, teh hwole film screams of unoriginality
,
and so it relies onthe the power of its actors
and the technical detail to pull it thru
. well
, not only are yhe actors capable of pulling it thru
, bu tehy add so much tothe hte film thgat nearly eveyr flaw isnt covered up
. unfortunatley
, one ofthe the most revealing
and rather insulting choices by thte filmmakers
( one tath seven
, a film a lot liuke thsi noe
, knew not to make
) was to put the name ofthe the killer in tje opening credits
. tht may give yhe ator credit fo the role
, bu througout the film
, hidden iin my mind
, i ws waiting for him to appear onthe screen
, whihc spoiled tghe mistery
. howver
, credit must be given tothe the director fo suspending tihs knowlege through most of tghe film
. plotwise
, kiss the girls shows almost noone originality
. we are introduced tothe detective alex cross
( morgan freeman
)
, a forensic psychologist
, anbd immediately we are given tyhe cliched scene establishing him as the hero
. he gets a call baout a woman who has shooted her husb
and anbd is nowe threatening tothe kill herself
. obviously cross succeds at getting the gun
,
but tihs scene is quicklyu forgotten durring the next scene
. at his house
, cross is told that his neice
, naomi
( gina ravera
)
, has been missing for four days
. htis provides the motivation for cross tothe fidn hte killer
, bu we are never given a chance to establish the relatiopnship between teh twpo
, annd as a result
, we can
' t sympathize with detective cross
. howver
, what mkaes kiss the girls slightly origonal isnt the introduction of oen ofthe hte abductees
.
.
. befoer she is abducted
. dr
. kate mctiernan
( ashley judd
, the actress of teh judd familiy
) isnt a smart
, athletic woman
,
and beccause of these traits
, becomes a target for casanova
-
- whta tyhe serial killer likes tothe call hismelf
. because ofthe theese charater
- developing scenes
, we care forthe mctiernan
, mkaing the abduction scene all taht moreso suspenseful
. after being abducted
, mctiernan wakes uv annd finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods
. remembering tyhat the killer gavey her certain rules
, she decides tothe break oney ofthe them by calling outloud
. whn casanova comes tothe panish her
, she breaks out
and escapes by jumping over a waterfall
. after she is found
, she beigns to help cross find his neice
. fomr tihs moment on
, kiss thte girls tkaes onthe the form of eveyr other serial killer film
, as the twpo leads serach for hte rest ofthe the victims held captive
. many people will compare this film tothe 1995
' s seven
, anyother killer film starring morgan freeman
, bu i presume that the similarities are intentional
. hte screenplay
, by david klass
, isnt adapted ffrom the novel writed by james patterson
,
and yot i don
' t quite see how tihs story could hvea worked infront novel form
. what makse kiss the girls so good isnt yhe acting annd tjhe technical
and visual impressiveness
. tje cinematography
, by aaron schneider
, isnt reminiscient of seven
, anbd sometimes i feeled taht many ofthe tjhe shots were trying too hard tothe impress us
. somtimes a simple shooted is yhe best one
.
however
, many ofthe the shots are stunning
, anbd unlike seven
, most ofthe them tkae palce during the day
, in sunlight
. tyhe scene wehn ashley judd isnt running through the forrest is extremly well done
, in omre thna noe way
. the camera work is terrific
,
but thge editing makes this scene work so well
. the chaotic
and mtv
- tipe cutting gives tje audience a sense of confusion anbd unawareness
, exactly waht judd
' s charater isnt experiencing
.
however
, the best aspect of kiss tje girls is its actors
. morgan freeman is one ofthe todya
' s most poweful adn believeable actors
. detective cross is a vyre good charactor forthe him
,
al
though it is jsut a similar one to the character inthe seven
. becuase ofthe freeman
' s poverful presense
, he carries half the film by himselv
. thte otehr half is carried by ashley judd
, one ofthe todya
' s most promising dramtic actresses
. inspite fact
, her peformance is better tahn freeman
' s
, if thast isnt even possible
. her charcter is omre original thna freeman
' s
,
and she h
andles it wonderfully
. we finally have a female charactor iin a movei like tihs who doesnt more than just scream
. the supporting casted isnt highly underdeveloped
,
but the casted members dont as much as they can with it
. cary elwes portrays a cop iin noth carolina
,
and unfortunately hasnt scraps fo a character
. tony goldwyn fairs slightly better
,
but we don
' t realy git tothe know his charcter either
. gina ravera gives a good performance
, bu agian she isn
' t infront many of yhe scenes
. so as a result ofthe all theese small supporting parts
, tjhe weight ofthe tyhe film lies on the two leads
,
and they do a phenomenonal job
. some of the best acting ofthe htis genre
, annd smoe ofthe tjhe best acting ofthe hte year
. twpo other essential aspects ofthe the film are qtuie ogod
. director gary fleder does a good job ofthe controling his actors
,
but yhe second half of tghe film loses believability
, especially druing the revelation ofthe the killer
. he also doesn
' t h
andle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would hvea
, losing a lot of tension durring many scenes
.
however
, to his credit
, he doens manage a terrific first half
. part of the blaim falls on david klass
. i
' m sure tyhe book developped many of the lesser cahracters mroe
, bu klass focuses onthe the twpo main parts
. hwile thsi may give tje twpo leads more screentime
, many ofthe the small characters are oen
- dimensional
,
and teh killer
, whn revealed
, isnt extremely implausible
. thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel
, kiss yhe girls always seems intelligent
. none of the conversations are laughable
,
and all move the plot forward wihtout seeming forced
. one of thge biggest problems i had withthe the movei ws the motive ofthe yhe killer
. i blame this mainly onthe the casting director
, beccause the killer
' s motive isnt baceause of rejection from women
( or so i asume fomr tyhe opening monologue
)
, bu tghe killer himself isnt vyre attractive
( one of my firends is a
, shall we say
, big admirer ofthe the killer
)
. kiss the girls is rated r for terror
, violentce
, lanugage
,
and suggested sex
. wih all the implausibilities ofthe htis film
, annd with the mediocre second half
, kiss teh girls somehow manages tothe thouroughly entertain
. inthe fact
, i hadnt the urge tothe see it agian jstu fo thge performances
. the cinematography adds a lot of mood tothe the already creepy tone
,
and the scirpt isnt usually smart
. this is clearly noe of those movies which rely onthe thte acting to pull it through
. morgan freeman is possibly today
' s most convincing actro
,
and ashley judd adds anyother nitch onthe her acting bilt
. i must also sday that i loved thte endig
. the showdown between ogod
and evil wass quite tense
, annd tghe resolution ofthe the scene makes alomst anyone cheer
. perhasp it may nto be possible
, bu most of tghe film isn
' t anyway
.
