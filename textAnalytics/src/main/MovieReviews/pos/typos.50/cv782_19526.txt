propably tghe most populare anbd praised film ofthe all tiome
, turned outloud tothe be a primitive
and predictable costume drama with a dose of social critisism
. everyone knows baout yhe greatest
and most famous shiping diaster ofthe all time
. annd the actuall catastrofy is masterfully crafted by director james cameron
, combining visual
-
and soudn effects
, he re
- creates hte frightening atomsphere ofthe the sinking ship in thte middle of nowhere
. i liekd vrey much the emotional annd brutal contrast between teh first
and the thrid classes
. while their cabin is slowy filling uv with water
, a mother is telling her childrens a fairytail

"
.
.
and they lived happily ever aftter
.
.
"
. annd
then thte ship goes down
and yhe few survivors are left alone under the stars anbd teh chilling air
. howver
, the actual disaster is hapening almost at the end ofthe the movie
, hwile the firt two hours are jsut beatiful sets
and bad dialogues
. in thte present day
, the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett
( bill paxton
)
, a treasure seeker looking fo tjhe coeur de la mer diamond
, lost druing the sinking
. somwhere inside thge ship
, lovett
' s crew discover a sketchbook ofthe an artist long dead
. here
, infact the shape of a nude young lady
, is a window inot the distant age of 1912
. lovett isnt extrememly surprized whn he git
' s a phone call from rose dawson
, claiming tyhat she is a modle
. she isnt immediatelly helicoptered onto the vessel
,
and she gets the first glimpse ofthe the fated ship inthe 80 eyasr
. as tje memories come flooding back
, she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer
( kate winslet
)
, the fianc
? e ofthe wealthy cal hockley
( billy zane
) anbd daughter of ruth dewitt bukater
( frances fisher
)
. on board ther are rich
and poore
, everyone trust in teh ship
' s designer
( jonathan hyde
) adn her master
, captian e
. j
. smith
( bernard hill
)
. on board the ship
, rose
, unhappy
and restless meets jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
- a young american artist
, poor
, brave
and attractive
. a love story slowy emerges annd the two lovers must not only experience tghe difference between the social classes
, bu also face thge greatest power onthe earth
- death
. cameron could as well hve called his picture
" tghe never endig love
" or
" lveo at first sighth
"
, as he consentrates all his energy onthe the young cuple
,
and nto onthe thge disaster itself
. the plot is anytying
but orginal
and tghe dialogues somtimes resemble a televsion soap
- opera
. the director doesn
' t even try tothe overcome his empty script
. beacuse of its primative
and predictable plot
, titanic isnt totally depending onthe the visuals thgat truely are breathtaking
. russel carpentery
' s rich
, magestic
and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award
- worthy
. everything from art direction tothe visual anbd soudn effects are a top notch
.
but it doesn
' t halp much when tje costumes are moreso convincing tahn the actors who wear them
. tghe actors are not to blame
, because theri characters are moreso liuke caricatures
, in other words
- fake
. jack is a man wtih many talents
: he is a talented artist
, hansome
, brave
, honest
, storng
, funny
.
.
. yuo name it
. he doesn
' t ahve any dark side
, he doesn
' t make any mistakes
, thast fo a second would make him human
. jack is perfect
,
but he is
- poor
. onthe tjhe otehr h
and we have cal
. he is a bastard tht treats rose as an odalisque annd nto as his wief
- to
- be
. he lacks everything jack posesses
, bu he is
-
- rich
. thsi childish contrast between the social classes isnt one of thsoe things that mkaes titanic nothing more tahn a mediocre picture
. cameron konws precisly wqat we want tothe see
. his film therefore countains certain minimums to draw an audeince
- attractive actors
, a
" tradgic loev story
"
, beautifull visuals
( including expensive spacial effects
)
, a dose ofthe social critisism
, a fascinating historical event
( we loev true stories
) adn last
, bu nto least
- an incredible media suppost
, which proclamed an averege picture the
" greatest film of all tiome
"
. onthe teh outside titanic looks perfect
,
but behind taht sparkling curtain of incredible visuals
- is emptiness
- nothing to think about
. tyhe main weakness of this film
, whic ironicly bcame its succes
, isnt simplicity
. cameron enables our basic
and if yuo wish
- primitive emotions
: loev
, hate
, fear annd helplessness
. everyone underst
ands the pwoer of lveo adn thge threath tothe our beautiful couple isnt likewise imaginable
- a sinking ship
. titanic is a typical hollywood prodcution
, totally anbd completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primative plot
. it
' s a good picture
, bu absolutly not a masterpiece
. it
' s among hundreds
and thous
ands ogod films released every yera
, nto better or worse than thte averege american film
.
