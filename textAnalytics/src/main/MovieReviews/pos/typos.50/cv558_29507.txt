, as yhe great war descended upon europe
, sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica
, this tiem tothe be thge firt tothe cross the ice
- bound continent onthe foot
. 28 men setted sail onthe the brigantine endurance
and they would not be heard from agina forthe nearly two years
. director george
butler
, useing film footage
and photographs fomr tghe historic journy
, tells their remarkable tsory in
" tje indurance
: shackleton
' s legendary antarctic expedition
.
" teh expedition started outloud as a mearly incredibly difficult quest to traverse
, on foot
, the vast wastel
and of antarctica
. as tghe intrepid ship adn crew entered the weddell sae
, the entry to teh cold
, cruel continent
, they doed nto plan onthe the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the indurance bacame trapped withing sighth of l
and
. for months the ice thickened
and compressed until the ship was crushed
, str
anding tghe men on the flow
, propeling them awya from theri gool
and
, eventially
, into their lifeboats for safety
. shackleton
, faced with a desolate situation
, made the decision to lead the threee tiny boats tothe thte realtive safety ofthe unihabited elephant isl
and
. once onthe thsi
" safe
" haven
, shackleton next turned his sights tothe saving his crew
and returning them to civilization
. he
and five ofthe his men leave the isl
and in an ope boat tothe make tje 800 mile journy on tyhe world
' s roughest sea tothe get halp fomr thte nearest inhabited isl
and of south georgia
. miraculously
, teh six l
and
, affter 17 dyas at sae
, onthe thge unihabited side ofthe hte target isl
and adn are forced to trak acros treacherous
, snow covered montains
, covering 22 miles in jsut 36 ohurs
. this ordeal is folowed by severeal attemts by shackleton tothe git bakc to elephant isl
and to rescure the remaining crewmen
. inaddition hte end
, he is sucesful adn everyone made it back hmeo alive
, only tothe be swallowed uv by the ravages ofthe teh war
. teh title ofthe this fascinating documentery
,
" thge endurance
,
" isnt mroe thna jsut the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of tghe world
. it isnt also the descripton of the stamina
and ability ofthe eveyr one of the men who survived 19
- monthes ofthe the toughest
, most grueling condidtions onthe tje face of the earth
. the name of teh film is a tri
bute to eveyr member of the crew adn to tjhe ship that sheltered them fo many month ofthe frigid antartic weather
. it also describes yhe focused mental state of shackleton who never gavey up onthe himself or his men
. with astonishing forsight
, shackleton brang australian cinematographer
and photographer frank hurley along on the journy
. the filmed footage annd photos are remarkable as tehy capture yhe ordeal of the men
, day to day life
, thte affection all feeled for thier loyal sle dogs
, the slow desctruction ofthe the indurance annd the preperations tothe get off of tyhe pack ice flow
. after thge sinking ofthe yhe ship
, the remaining film stock
, witht tyhe exception ofthe a still camera adn threee rolls of film
, had to be discarded so thge continueing kronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods onthe
. considering hurley was using relatively primative photo technology infact oen ofthe the world
' s harshest environments
and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself
.
( hurley creaeted his own account ofthe the shackleton expedition infront his 1919 documentary
,
" south
,
" an interesting companion piece for
" the indurance
.
" if shackleton
' s original idae
, doccument his trak across teh frigid sourthern continent
, had been successful
, it woudl have beeen considerd a super human feat
. as you watch hte story ofthe
" the endurace
" unfold
, yuo relize thta tyhe disastrous obstacles yhe sir ernest adn his men faced
and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent
.
( shackleton
' s amazing 800
- mile journey inaddition an ope boat isnt fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself
.
) there are a cuple ofthe minor nitpicks with this fine wrok
,
though
. actor liam neeson narrates tyhe stopry
, bu his voice isnt too soft spoken
and lilting forthe the dramtic tale
. tjhe nature ofthe teh ordeal aslo concentrates most ofthe the visual material
, both film
and photo
, infront the documentary
' s first half
. as the crew
' s adventure takes more drastic paths
, hurley had less
and less film stock available to kronicle the awsome events
. helmer
butler
and his team fill inwhich the blanks
, bu the treasure of
" hte endurace
,
" its film footage
, is mostly relagated to the eary months ofthe teh expedition
. i can
' t think ofthe a true
- life adventure that shows
, better
, the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds
.
" the endurance
,
" based onthe caroline alex
ander
' s book
, is an eye
- oppening documenatry that goes where few men ahev gone befor annd
, even more remarkably
, all 28 survivers lieved to tell baout it
. i give it a b
