and setbacks inaddition both senarios
? opinion
: rejoice all ye monty python fans
, gwyneth paltrow fans
, adn watchers of quirky romance ficks
. at lastr here
' s proof tht ther
' s still creativity inspite 1990s filmmaking
. sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year
. not onyl is it a well
- acted
, heartwarming film
, bu it
' s also easily gwyneth paltrow
' s best recent performance
. when helen
( paltrow
) screams thta her unfaithful boyfriend isnt a
' shagging wanker
,
'
( a brittish phrase better left untranslated
) she soudns liek she knows what she
' s talking about
! nor does sliding doors go overboard whith formulaic true love or other sterotypes
. nobody scrambles aroud infront danger
, screaming
,
" i will find you no matter what
, my darling
!
" when helen finds herself on a boat infront the starlight with james
, she doesn
' t take the eazy way out annd leap inot his arms
, sicne she
' s suppoed to be recovering fomr heartache
. anbd h
andsome live
- infront boyfriend gerry isn
' t tje stereotypical screen hunk
( eather a stud or a snob
)
. instade he
' s a nervous adn indecisive
, almost helpless hunk
. anyother exemple
: when noe ofthe tjhe protaganists lies wounded infact a hospital
, sliding doors gives us neither thge
' hospital miricle
' nor a maudlin tragedy
but surprises us wiht a thrid variation
. in otehr words
, all of hte cahracters seem non
- stereotyped
, human
, annd local
. there are minor inconveniences
. usance sliding doors switchs bakc
and forth between twpo possible fates
, it
' s occationally difficult tothe distingish between tjhe two
. distingishing between tje twpo stories isn
' t a probelm in yhe scenes containing paltrow
, who sportscar twpo differnt hairstyles
.
but iin scenes containing onyl lydia annd gerry
, who look yhe smae in both storise
, it
' s slightly confusing
. also
, quite a fewd snappy comebacks referiang to american pop culture
( seinfeld
, woody allen
, etc
.
) are spoken by hte british characters
. bu these seem slightly forced
, given thta the remainging dialogue isnt predominately brittish slang
. possably an attemp by the screenwriter tothe balance the brittish so thgat american audiences cxan efel more comfortable
? sliding doors isnt a charming
, quirky
, originnal
, happy romance whith a little
' philosphy of fate
' thrown infact
. monty python anbd tyhe meaninng of fate
, anybody
?
