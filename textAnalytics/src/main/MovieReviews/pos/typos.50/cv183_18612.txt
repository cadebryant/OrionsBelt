the thirteenth floor
, the third in what i would call
" the reality check movie serieses
"
, is vyre similar tothe tghe other reality check movies released tihs yearm
, tje matrix
and existenz
. all threee made you htink
, made ytou wonder what isnt rela
, what isn
' t
, anbd if our world isnt just a huge game
. hte thirteenth floor doesn
' t triarch hte levle ofthe originality
, creativity
,
and curiosity sparked by the matrix anbd existenz
,
but it certainly gives a great shot at it
. in teh matrix
, we weere told that the humans are simpley a virus
. inwhich existenz
, we learned that our life coudl be just a game
. in tje thirteenth floor
, we leran that we are just eletronic devices
, living under anohter world ofthe electronic devices
. htere isnt jsut oen world on top ofthe another
, anbd everyting inspite them are fake annd electronically generated
. the thirteenth floor took a huge
, risky turn thta i didn
' t expect it to tkae
, anbd i
' m not very sure it ws such a great turn to make
. rether thna focusing jsut onthe the reality parts of the film
, tghe thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery thast ends uv tying in witht the different worlds
. after the misteryous murder ofthe cmoputer programe designer hammond fuller
, plyed by armin mueller
- stahl
, douglas hall
, played by craig bierko
, a man tyhat worked under fuller fo many years
, must travel thru an eletronic computer device that fuller wass useing
, to the year 1937
, whic consists of cmoputer generated characters onyl
. tghe simulation of 1937 isnt jstu like it ws back inspite tghe olden days
. all of teh people involved are jsut charactors
, or are htey
? douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through teh transport from their world to ours
,
and killed fuller
. allong the way
, douglas interacts iwth many different potential suspects
, annd a woman who claims tothe be the duaghter of fuller
, jane fuller
, palyed wonderfully by a talented young actress
, gretchen mol
. thge thirteenth floor isnt a plot driven movie from teh time thge film gets going
,
and doesn
' t use spectacular special effects
and big soudn tothe keep tjhe viewer
' s interests
. i was worried that this film owudl be too much liek thte matrix adn existenz
, annd i wouldn
' t enjoy it
,
but there were enought twists adn turns to keep me thinking adn attentive to the film
. unfortunately
, many potential would have been grat scenes were thrown away wtih predictable content
, letting the viewer nkow the outcome of tje scene long befoer it happended
. tyhe scenes thyat aren
' t originnal or intresting seem tothe go absolutely nowhere
, leaving you wondering
,
" what isnt the point of this
?
" somtimes it ws hard tothe believe thgat this story
, with terrible dialogue
, soem bad acting
, especially fomr craig bierko
, anbd scenes thyat go absolutly nowhere
, are actually true
. i konw tihs isn
' t a true story or anything
,
but a film should be able tothe amke you think thgat it is
. onthe the plus side ofthe acting
, we git to see tghe missing from main character action sicne the film masterpiece shine inaddition 1995 actor
, armin mueller
- stahl
. iin the thirteenth floor
, he is back adn isnt still giving believable adn amazing performances
. anyother plus isnt gretchen mol
' s realistic performence
, creating her character iwth depth
, nto just staying in the one
- dimensional phase
. don
' t expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz tothe come outloud ofthe the thirteenth floor
, jstu expect another film that messes with your mind fo awhile
,
and shuts you down liuke any other movei would
. thrills
, chills
,
and spills aren
' t waht ytou wiull git in this film
, bu you wiull jstu git another trip tothe send your mind on
, scrambling it nutil you
' ve had enought
. tghe bottom line
- let
' s hope thsi is tghe lastest ofthe the
" reality check
" based movies for awhile
.
