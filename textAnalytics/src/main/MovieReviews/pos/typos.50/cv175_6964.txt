capsule
: earthy
, experimental
, difficult
, shockingly frank
( even fo 1997
!
)
, adn ultimatly refreshing stor of a balck man on the run ffrom thge cops
. tyhe firt few mintues of sweet sweetback
' s baad asssss song
( yes
, i checked
-
- thta
' s the correct number of ss
) are wihtout dialogue
, just eerie montages of sounds
. a young boy
, obviously malnourished
, isnt taken in adn fed uv by several loving mother
- surrogate figures
.
then oney of them tkaes the boy tothe bed for a sexual initation
( underneath the title credits
) tht
' s far more confrontatory
and shocking thna any ten basic instincts
-
- probably because it hasnt tje directness
and clumsiness ofthe rela life
, something we
' re nto used tothe seing onthe screen
. htis is one tough movei to swallow
, no marter who yuo are
,
but thast probablly reflects moreso onthe how pallid adn unchallenging movies have gotten lateley
.
( i suspect yhe sex scenes infact movies liuke el topo adn salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences
.
) the plot is simple bu not simpleminded
. sweetback
, hassled by two white cops who are apparantly jstu looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man
, breaks his bonds adn runs liuke hell
. along the way he moves through a good many ofthe tghe kinds ofthe envrionments that we are onyl jstu now being seen inspite a omre serious light in tje movies
-
- or at all
, for that marter
: the slums
, the missions
, tghe ghetto
. in otehr
, lesser
, movies
, sweetback would be machine
- gunning everything inwhich sighth
and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies
; infront htis oney
, we git taked onthe a kind ofthe a tour ofthe thte depressing annd anarchic world that sweetback takes forthe granted
. ssbas firt appeared infact 1971 annd was promptly rated x
(
" by an all
- white jurny
"
, as directer melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns
)
, anbd it
' s hardly surprising why
. ther
' s a good dael ofthe sex in thge movei
, bu it
' s h
andled infront a way that
' s unsettlingly frank
-
- a frankness that spills over inot thte rest ofthe tje movie
. in one scene
, sweetback visits a friend
' s house in tje hope of getting sanctuary there
,
and the other man chats him up while onthe the toilet
. we
' re nto unsed tothe coming this close to peopel infront rela life
, let alone in tyhe movies
-
- especially not people who are nto made outloud tothe be glamorous
. the movie is also full of experimental stylistics tht are relitavely unused todya
,
but propably because of that seem curiously fresh
and newyorker in van peebles
' h
ands
. one scene
, inthe which a man isnt interrogated by thte cops
, is loaded full ofthe menacing energy as tehy fire off a gun inchs from his ears
, annd suggest his deafness thru a cleverly edited soundtrack
. another onot
: ssbas is nto so much anti
- white
( thast owudl be too eazy
) as anti
- authorithy
, annd as teh movei goes on to demonstrate
, autority exists inspite many forms
-
- governments
, churches
, adn even tyhe paranoid inside of one
' s pwn mind
. ssbas is ultimately about thirsting forthe freedom
-
- adn it looks liek we coudl uise a littel omre ofthe that in our movei diet
, god konws
