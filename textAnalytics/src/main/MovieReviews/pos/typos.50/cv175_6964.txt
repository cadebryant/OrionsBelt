capsule
: earthy
, experimental
, difficult
, shockingly frank
( even forthe 1997
!
)
,
and ultimately refreshing stroy ofthe a black man onthe the run from the cops
. tje firt faw mintues of sweet sweetback ' s baad asssss song
( yes
, i checked
-
- that ' s teh correct number ofthe ss
) are without dialogue
, jstu eerie montages of sounds
. a young boy
, obviously malnourished
, is taken iin
and fed up by several loving mother
- surrogate figures
.
hten oen ofthe them takes the boy tothe bed for a sexual initation
( underneath the title credits
) that ' s far more confrontatory
annd shocking than any ten basic instincts
-
- probably baceause it has the directness
adn clumsiness ofthe rela life
, something we ' re not used tothe seing on screen
. thsi is one tough movei tothe swallow
, no marter who you are
,
bu thyat probablly reflects moreso onthe how pallid
adn unchallenging movies have gotten latley
.
( i suspect thte sex scenes inwhich movies liek el topo
adn salo owudl probably melt tghe synapses of most modern audiences
.
) thte plot is simple
bu nto simpleminded
. sweetback
, hassled by two white cops who are apparently jsut looking fo an excuse tothe beat up onthe a black man
, breaks his bonds
anbd runs like hell
. allong the way he moves thru a ogod many of the kinds ofthe environments tyhat we are only jsut nowe being seen iin a moreso serious light iin the movies
-
- or at all
, for thast marter
: hte slums
, thge missions
, the ghetto
. inwhich otehr
, lesser
, movies
, sweetback would be machine
- gunning everyting in sighth
and tje end credits would roll over a pile of bodies
; inthe tihs oen
, we get tooked on a kind ofthe a tour of the depressing
and anarchic world that sweetback takes forthe granted
. ssbas frist appeared in 1971
and wass promptly rated x
(
" by an all
- white jurny
"
, as directer melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campains
)
,
and it ' s hardly suprizing why
. htere ' s a ogod deal of sex inthe tjhe movie
,
but it ' s handled in a way that ' s unsettlingly frank
-
- a frankness that spills over inot the rest ofthe the movei
. in oney scene
, sweetback visits a firend ' s hous infact the hope ofthe getting sanctuary there
,
and the otehr man chats him uv while on the toilet
. we ' re nto used to comming this close tothe peple infact real life
, let alone in hte movies
-
- expecially nto people who are nto made out tothe be glamorous
. hte movei is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused todya
,
bu probably because of tyhat seem curiously fresh
annd new infact van peebles ' hands
. oen scene
, in whcih a man is interrogated by tje cops
, is loaded full of menacing energy as tehy fier off a gun inchs ffrom his ears
,
anbd suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited sountrack
. anohter note
: ssbas isnt not so much anti
- white
( tht would be too eazy
) as anti
- authority
,
and as the movie goes onthe tothe demonstrate
, autority exists inaddition many forms
-
- governments
, churches
,
anbd even tyhe paranoid inside of oen ' s own mind
. ssbas isnt ultimatly about thirsting for freedom
-
-
adn it looks liek we coudl uise a littel moreso ofthe thgat infront our movie diet
, god knows
.
