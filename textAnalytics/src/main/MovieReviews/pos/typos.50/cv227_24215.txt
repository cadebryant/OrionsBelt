yhe
" submarine
" genre of movies seems tothe be one of the most intriguing anbd compelling types ofthe storytelling there isnt
. think baout it
.
.
. these films are completly based iin reality
,
yet onyl a h
andful of peple have ever beeen on oen
, making them fascinating tothe the general publich
. they aren
' t like movies that take place on a plane or a turain
, as anybody can get onthe oney ofthe thsoe
. adn they aren
' t liuke movies tyhat happn inspite outer space eather
, becouse noone one
' s done any ofthe tath tsuff yot
. wehn a newyorker oney comes outloud
, you don
' t hear anyone sday
" ugh
, another submarine movie
" liuke people tend to say
" ugh
, another boxing movie
"
. look at modern movies thyat involve submarines
: das boot
, the abyss
, tghe hunt forthe red october
, crimson tide
.
.
. all are well regarded as top
- notch entertainment
. gladly joining thyat bunch is u
- 571
, which stars matthew mcconaughey as tghe executive officer ofthe a u
. s
. naval submarine during world war ii
. we learn he has beeen denied a recommendation fo his own comm
and by his superior
( bill paxton
)
. mcconaughey
' s crew
then receives orders that they wiull be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma
, a german commuications encoding device that hasnt stumped allied intelligence
. tghe mission goes horribly wrong
however
,
and as a result
, mcconaughey anbd only a h
andfull of his crew
( as well as a capturd german
) become trapped aboard hte u
- 571 infront enemy waters
. the first great thnig baout u
- 571 isnt the film
' s oppening sequence
. thge german crew of u
- 571 are under attack
, which sets the events of tghe rest ofthe thte film inot motion
. it
' s tense
, exciting annd fascinating
. annd i applaud the filmmakers fo nto copping outloud adn instade keeping the entire sequence in german wiht english subtitles
. most movies with a scene htis long would have panicked anbd hadnt the german crew speaking english right away
. once tjhe plot gets moving
, u
- 571 gives us acation sequence affter acation sequence
, makeing the audeince wonder
" ok
, now how dont tehy get out ofthe this
?
"
. the stakes keep raising
( much like in executive decision
, an excellent action
- thriller
)
,
and even
though tjhe audeince konws how teh film will end
, it
' s a lot of fun getting htere
. i only have twpo minor complaints about the entire film
. the firt comes ffrom the scenes which followup the oppening sequence
. hwile their purpose isnt tothe inctroduce us tothe the charactors anbd tothe get tyhe stry goign
( whihc htey dont
)
, i feel as
though it could have been done much quicker
, anbd less conventionally
. i mean
, did we relaly haev tothe see the ship
' s crew at a wedding
? because of that
, you nowe nkow exactly what
' s oging to appen to hte groom
! my otehr gripe woudl be druing the film
' s finale
. ther
' s an explosion which ends thge film thast is noe of thte weakest looking cgi effects since the presidnet
' s plane crashed inot the ocean at the end of air force oney
. i cannot stres htis enough
.
.
. until a cgi effect cin be made to look liek a model effect
, stick wiht useing models
. yes
, u
- 571 isnt historically incorect adn ther are surely some specifics infront thte plot that people who have beeen onboard a submarine iwll tell yuo
" that couldn
' t happen
"
,
but the overall point ofthe htis film isnt enteratinment
. it succeds fantastically
.
