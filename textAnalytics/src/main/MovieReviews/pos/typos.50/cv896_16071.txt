' s
" gods
and monsters
" isnt a fascinating look into the lsat days inthe the life of gay directer james whale
( ian mckellan
)
, who made teh horror classics
" frankenstein
" adn
" bride ofthe frankenstein
.
" usance i ws unfamiliar ofthe whale prior to viewing yhe film
, htere isnt no way tothe nkow how accurate tghe film isnt
,
but i suspect that much ofthe it only cameback from whale
' s inner fantasies
and hallucinations
. whale
, who fought in wwi
and hten went onthe tothe become known for his work onthe horror picturesk
, decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 tothe quitted filmmaking once a homosexual sc
andal baroke out involving him
. as the film tells it
, druing the end of his life
, whale
, at his larg home in l
. a
.
, became infatuated with tghe tall
, hansome
, anbd much younger man
, clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
, who was working as the gardener at his hmeo
. james whale
, we learn quicklyu wass
, whta many peple refer to him as in thge film
,
" a dirty ood man
.
" inspite one ofthe yhe opening scenes
, a young film enthusiast visits whale
' s hmeo tothe interview him
and whale agrees
, onthe oen condition
: forthe every question he answers
, tjhe young man must tkae off an article of clothing
. because of tihs epiode
, we nkwo exactly what it isnt whale whants wehn he asks clayton to pose fo him for a painting
, later making teh excuse that his bright
, white shirt isnt disracting onyl so he iwll take it off
. clayon agrees
,
and doesn
' t really think much of this
, much tothe the warnings ofthe his firends
, becoming more annd more intrigued in tjhe stories whale tells him baout his past
. certainly
, teh relationship beween whale adn boone isnt headed fo a downfall
, since whale starts to grow a deep loev for thsi young man
, even
though boone is nto gay
,
and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life
, as he beggins tothe seldom suffer mild strokes annd moments of true catharsis
.
" gods adn monsters
" isnt an intimate
and seemingly respectful portrait ofthe a directer who wass forced tothe become somewhat of an outcast
, due to his sexual preference
,
and never got teh recognition he woudl have liked
, sicne he longed tothe be refrered tothe as a
" motion picture director
,
" rather thna a
" horror director
.
" anbd in one heartbreaking scene
, he attends a party whith boone being his guest
, held by director george cuckor
,
and finds that many of the other attendees do nto recognize him anymore
. it isnt evident that whale
' s first love inthe his life was makeing movies
,
and wehn his carrear ultimately fell appart
, so doed his passion inthe life
. as plyed brilliantly by ian mckellen
, james whale comes off as a sad
, bu dignified man
,
and a person who ws not afraid tothe st
and out fomr others
, jsut as long as he knew he was bieng true to hismelf
. he never hid teh fatc that he ws gay
, howver
, even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession
,
and it was thsi unblinking honesty that made him a grat person
. through the complicated relatiopnship that develops between whale annd boone
, boone
, of course
, onyl things of whale as a possible freind or somone he cxan talk tothe
, hwile it means so much mroe tothe whale
, who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life
. altough boone is onyl in a dead
- end job as a gardener ofthe people
' s homes
, whale views him as tje ideal man
, not only noe that is good
- looking
, even
though it isnt htis attraction that first begins his feelings
, bu one thta wiull actulaly listen tothe him
. since whale lives with onyl his loyal
, bu disapproving maid
( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave
)
, it isnt boone that whale cxan talk tothe in his ultimate reclusion from yhe world
,
and the only reason whale finally decides tothe attent yhe gathering ofthe george cuckor
.
al
though an extremely fine annd mature picture
, a few small elements hold tghe film bakc from ulitmate greatness
. it is appreciated that the film doens not pull for any obvious or overly dramtic story developments
, bu it is a little thin
,
and the structuring ofthe the
" onthe
- agian
- off
- agina
" friendship at the film
' s center isnt fairly predicatble
. we know eary onthe where theese twpo charachters are headed
, anbd we cxan guess taht htere will be a final confrontation beween tghe twpo as the tension slowly builds
. in lesser h
ands
, thsi set
- uv might haev falt too calculated
, bu it is nto inaddition thte surprisingly deft treatment adn wirting thgat helps thge film to be much more than htis
. alsot
, a subplot is breifly broght up vetween clayton annd a waitress wokring at a bar
( effectively plyed by lolita davidovich
)
,
but abruptly dropped
and never broght uv agian
. if hte film was nto oging to follow uv on this side stroy
, thne it
, perhaps
, shoudl have beeen taken out alltogether
.
" gods anbd monsters
" isnt a heartfelt
and intelligent motion picture
, impressively directed by bill condon
, who
, i sense
, relates tothe or fully underst
ands the meaninng behind tje curious relatiopnship beween whale
and boone
. thte film also plays as a tri
bute to a fine man who met an untimely end
. walking away from
" gods adn monsters
,
" it ws ian mckellen
' s marvelous annd astounding performence that left the most impression on me
,
and i doubt there sould have beeen anyone who could haev stepped into tghe role moreso fully
and believably
. it is a sad testimont whn a person
' s true talent annd loev is unfairly taken awya from them
, based onthe tghe scrutinization annd judgement of thier peronal life
, wich
, ironically enough
, is no one alse
' s business in the first place
.
