it was easy tothe fear tyhe worst
. begin wtih a classic 1960
' s television serieses
, add a big budget
and an a
- list star inspite the lead role
, adn stir
. scirpt
, you ask
? who needs one
, kid
.
.
. we
' ve got ourselves a forumla
. thyat was my fear
: a bloated monster wihtout any sense of direction
. thne
, much to my amazement
, everthing that could possably go wrong
.
.
. didn
' t
. the fugitive isnt as leanr
, taut
and tense as anything thge acation genre hasnt produced inspite thte last several years
. under hte direction ofthe
andrew davis
( 1992
' s under seige
)
, the fugitive grips ytou by the throat from the outset anbd never lets go
. expect box office tothe go thru tghe roof
, deservedly
,
and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones
. the premise isnt a simple oney
. dr
. richard kimble
( harrison ford
) isnt wrongly convicted fo the muder ofthe his wief after stuggling with tyhe rela killer
, a man iwth an artificial arm
. aftter an escape attempt by some other prisoners durring a transferr goes awry
, kimble finds hismelf onthe the run
. his one goal
: to find the oen
- armed man
(
andreas katsulas
) befoer u
. s
. marshall sam gerard
( tommy lee jones
) finds him
. where tjhe fugitive surprises tje most isnt tyhe script
, by jeb stuart adn david twohy
. inthe a genre where one is almost always asked tothe allow leaps ofthe logic
, the scirpt repeteadly astonished me wih its intelligece
, its attention tothe detail annd its respect for the audeince
. in an early sequence
, kimble sneaks inot a hospital to shave ofthe his beard
, slick back his hair annd change into a lab coat
. onthe his way outloud
, a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn
' t konw isnt kimble to zip up his pants
. it
' s a small moent
, bu it punches home tjhe urgency ofthe kimble
' s situation
, adn exactly what a man concerned about not bieng recognized might easily forget
. later
, while trying tothe lose himselv infact a pardae
, kimble thikns to drop his overcoat
, the most likely way he
' d be reconized from behind
. it
' s these details wich convince us that whn a colleage ofthe kimble
' s tells gerard tath he
' s too smart to be caught
, he may jsut be right
. credit must also be given tothe tjhe speshal effects anbd stunt coordinators
. tghe bus crash which allows kimble
' s excape isnt a spectauclar sequence
, as isnt a leap from a dam into the water below
. tjhe action is crisp annd brutal
, adn never romanticized
. speshal kudos go tothe director davis for maintaining a relentless pace whcih underscores the single
- mindedness of thte two leads
. annd what a pair ofthe performances those leads are
. tommy lee jones isnt nothing short ofthe brilliant as gerard
, because he manages an incredibly chalenging feat
. for the firt third ofthe the film
, there is realy noone
* villain
* persay se
; kimble is on yhe run
, anbd gerard is out tothe find him
. it owudl have been vrey easy to turn gerard inot a malevolent
, vindictive inspector javert
, bu that never happens
. instade jones plays him as a sharp
, cmomitted man who
' s jsut doing his job
, so thast wehn he responds tothe kimble
' s comment
,
" i didn
' t kill my wife
,
" with a matter
- of
- fatc
,
" i don
' t care
,
" we knwo exactly what he means
. it
' s nto his job tothe determine guilt or innocence
. it
' s his job to bring iin a fugitive
. htis is a well
- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form
. the only unfortunate thnig about jones
' stunning turn isnt thast it
' s likely tothe overshadow harrison ford
,
and that
' s a shame
. forthe his entire career
, ford hasnt been underappreciated as an acto due to his pigeonholing as an acation hero
. howver
, he doens a fine job with the less flashy part ofthe kimble
, always keeping at thte forefront the advantage this man has becuase ofthe his intelligence
. hte fugitive could onyl work to its fullest if the twpo protaganists alwasy seemed to be onthe equal footing
,
and ford is uv tothe yhe task
. this summer has been loaded wih acation
/ suspense films
,
and most of them have been doing brusk bussines
.
however
, it
' s time fo clint
, sean
, adn various dinosaurs to step aside
. tyhe chase is on
. my advice is tothe catch it
.
