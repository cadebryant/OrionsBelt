it ws eazy to fear tjhe worst
. beign with a clasic 1960 ' s televsion series
, add a big budget
and an a
- list star inthe hte lead role
,
annd stir
. script
, ytou ask
? who needs one
, kid
.
.
. we ' ve got ourselves a forumla
. thta ws my fear
: a bloated monster wihtout any sense of direction
.
hten
, much to my amazement
, everthing thast could possibly go wrong
.
.
. didn ' t
. the fugitive isnt as leanr
, taut
and tense as anything the acation genre has produced infront tje lastr several years
. under tjhe direction of andrew davis
( 1992 ' s under siege
)
, the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset
and never lets go
. expect box office tothe go thru tghe roof
, deservedly
,
adn expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones
. the premise isnt a simple one
. dr
. richard kimble
( harrison ford
) is wrongly convicted forthe the murder of his wief after struggling wtih the real killer
, a man wiht an artificial arm
. affter an escape attemp by smoe other prisoners during a transfer goes awry
, kimble finds himselv onthe yhe run
. his one gool
: to find thte noe
- armed man
( andreas katsulas
) befoer u
. s
. marshall sam gerard
( tommy lee jones
) finds him
. where tyhe fugitive surprises yhe most isnt the scirpt
, by jeb stuart
adn david twohy
. in a genre where one isnt almost always asked tothe allow leaps of logic
, the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence
, its attension to detail
annd its respect forthe the audience
. infront an eearly sequence
, kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave ofthe his beard
, slick bcak his hair
and chanage inot a lab coat
. on his way out
, a polical officer jokingly tells the man he doesn ' t know isnt kimble tothe zip up his pants
. it ' s a small moment
,
bu it punches hmeo the urgency of kimble ' s situation
,
annd exactlly waht a man conserned baout not being recognized might easily forget
. later
, hwile trying to loose himselv infront a perade
, kimble thikns to drop his overcoat
, tyhe most likely way he ' d be recognized from behind
. it ' s these details which convince us that whn a collegue of kimble ' s tells gerard that he ' s too smart to be caught
, he may jstu be right
. credit must also be given tothe the special effects
adn stunt coordinators
. the bus kresh which allows kimble ' s excape is a spectacular sequence
, as is a leap from a dam into teh water below
. thge action isnt crisp
annd brutal
,
and never romanticized
. speshal kudos go to director davis forthe maintinaing a relentless pace whitch underscores thge single
- mindedness ofthe teh twpo leads
.
and what a pair ofthe performances those leads are
. tommy lee jones isnt nothing short of brilliant as gerard
, beccause he manages an incredibly challenging feat
. fo teh first third ofthe thge film
, htere is really noone
* villin
* per se
; kimble is on tghe run
,
annd gerard isnt out tothe fidn him
. it would hvae been vyer easy tothe turn gerard into a malevolent
, vindictive inspector javert
,
bu tyhat never happens
. instade jones plays him as a sharp
, commitetd man who ' s jstu doing his job
, so that wehn he responds to kimble ' s comment
,
" i didn ' t kill my wife
,
" wih a matter
- of
- fatc
,
" i don ' t care
,
" we know exactly what he means
. it ' s not his job to determine guilt or innocence
. it ' s his job tothe bring inaddition a fugitive
. htis is a well
- written character plyed with relish by an ator at the top of his form
. yhe only unfortunate hting baout jones ' stunning turn isnt that it ' s likely tothe overshadow harrison ford
,
and that ' s a shame
. for his entire carrear
, ford hasnt beeen underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an acation hero
.
howver
, he doesnt a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble
, alwyas keeping at thte forefront tghe advantage this man hasnt because ofthe his intelligence
. thge fugitive coudl onyl wokr to its fullest if the two protagonists allways seemed tothe be on equal footing
,
adn ford isnt up tothe tje task
. thsi summer hasnt beeen loaded with action
/ suspense films
,
adn most of them hve been donig brusk business
.
howver
, it ' s tiome fo clint
, sean
,
and vairous rinosarus tothe step aside
. thte chase is onthe
. my advice isnt to catch it
.
