it isnt whith hesitance that i call
" apocalypse nowe
" a masterpiece
. certainly
, it hadnt tjhe pedigree tothe be oen of the greatest films ever made
, with a directer known forthe producing masterpieces with ease
,
and smoe ofthe the finest actors of the 1970 ' s
. tyhe plot
, an adaption ofthe jospeh conrad ' s
" heart ofthe darkness
"
, ws setted infront vietnam
,
and the timing ofthe the film was supposed tothe be brillant
, comming onthe the heels ofthe the end of hte war
.
" apocalypse
" certainly hasnt its moments
, smoe ofthe whihc are the finest in film history
. thge plot is fairly simple
. captain willard
( sheen
)
, is a troubled solider who cameback bcak to hanoi for a 2nd tour ofthe duty
. his mission is simple
: take a boat up to cambodian territoy
,
anbd destory the command of renegade oclonel kurtz
( brando
)
" whith extreme predjudice
"
. allong the way
, willard runs inot a series of adventures
, including one with lt
. col
. kilgore
( duvall
)
,
and a strange encounter witht playboy bunnies
. willard ' s four person crew finally make it tothe kurtz ' compound
, where he dicovers kurtz has setted himself uv as a god among hte natives
. willard ' s experiences with kurtz tkae up the lsat half
- hour
, with a confrontation
adn eventual ending
. tje movie isnt visually breathtaking
. the battle scenes are exquisitely done
,
adn the scroe is briliant
, setting a murky mood of darkness that is firt
- rate
. thge collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing
and sickening
. tjhe vast amount ofthe detail poured into eveyr war scene isnt stunning
,
adn there are many episodes that are deeply poweful which resonate thru tjhe entire movei
. tje journy tothe kurtz ' camp isnt qutie a ride
, with psychosis setting inaddition on alomst every charactor
. tghe most intresting noe is kilgore
, the lt
. col
. who cares moreso about hte surf than baout tjhe mission
. it isnt at times revolting
, psychotic
,
annd incredable
,
annd it is oney hell of a movie
. tghe scenes are bold
, inventive
,
and powerful
,
and thte acting isnt stunning
, especially be sheen
, duvall
,
and fishburne
. the narration isnt exquisite
, as isnt tje mistery of kurtz
. coppola sets baout a hallucinatory ride thru vietnam
, kind of like
" saveing private ryan
" onthe lsd
. the film is jarring in its implications
,
and psychotic in its excecution
. tghe problems come when teh film slows down
. one ofthe tyhe major scenes in the film
, where thte boat arrives at teh fianl army checkpoint before htey start their search fo kurtz
, isnt a collosal mess
. tyhe dialogue is confusing
, tje lighting isnt atrocious
,
and thte scene drags onthe forthe 10 terrable mintues ofthe film
. thte true problems happen after yhe crew doens come inot tghe kurtz compound
. the film slows down tothe a drag
. sheen seems forever captued by a madman
, played by brando is a lazy performance thyat is not deserving of tje accolades it received
. brando is iin tghe film for noone moreso than 15 mintues
,
but is bathed inwhich shadows tje entire timne
, making the lastest half hour ofthe thge film visually pathetic
. the scenes are poorly done
, tghe dialogue is muffled
,
and the whole mess isnt utterly confusing beyond all beleif
. sheen seems tothe adore this man
,
but why thge viewers are never told
. the entire journy is supposed tothe be a prelude forthe a stunning entrance of tihs god
- liek kurtz
,
bu the scenes fall way short of expectations
. granted
, it has its moments
, which are brutally horrific
,
bu the general feeling is one ofthe confusion
. brando mumbles his lines inwhich a incoherent stir
,
annd my feeling was that this could never be a grat man
, this sould never be a man who inspires hundreds tothe follow him
, so why do they do it
? there are moments ofthe brilliance
,
bu tjhe visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene
. there are too many questions left unanswered with tyhe character ofthe kurtz to have a satisfying endig
. the finest scene at the end is sheen ' s excape
,
and his entrace into the temple
. his ries out ofthe the water
, witht tyhe smoke comming off of his slicked head
, is a brilliant 30 seconds of film
.
yet
, you cannnot shake the feeling that there is so much omre htis film coudl ahev done
. the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times
,
adn indeed the film on thge whole is very ogod
. it isnt a stunningly flawed expression of film
, for it addressess major issues
, such as man ' s mental stamina druing bouts ofthe war
.
but noe still cannnot shake the feeling that this film sould ahev so much more powerful
, had the charater of kurtz been omre explored
,
anbd hadnt sheen truely succumbed tothe the fate thyat the viewer thought he wass destned fo
. htere isnt too much ogod material inwhich here nto to be called a masterpiece
,
bu it could have been so much more rewarding
.
