it is with hesitance taht i call
" apocalypse now
" a masterpiece
. certainly
, it had the pedigree tothe be one ofthe the greatest films ever made
, with a directer known forthe producing masterpieces with ease
,
and some of the finest actors of the 1970
' s
. yhe plot
, an adaptions of jospeh conrad
' s
" heart of darkness
"
, was set infact vietnam
,
and yhe timing of thte film ws supposed to be briliant
, coming onthe tjhe heels of the end of tje war
.
" apocalypse
" certainly has its moments
, smoe ofthe whitch are the finest in film history
. tjhe plot is fairly simple
. captain willard
( sheen
)
, isnt a troubled soldier who came bakc tothe hanoi forthe a 2nd tour ofthe duty
. his mission isnt simple
: tkae a boat uv tothe cambodian terriory
, adn distroy tje comm
and of renegade oclonel kurtz
( br
ando
)
" wih extreme predjudice
"
. along the way
, willard runs inot a series ofthe adventures
, including one with lt
. col
. kilgore
( duvall
)
, anbd a strange encounter with playboy bunnies
. willard
' s four person crew finaly mkae it to kurtz
' compound
, where he discovers kurtz has set himselv up as a god among hte natives
. willard
' s experiences whith kurtz tkae up teh last half
- hour
, wih a confrontation anbd eventual ending
. the movei isnt visually breathtaking
. hte battle scenes are exquisitely done
,
and the csore isnt brilliant
, setting a murky mood of darkness tyhat isnt frist
- rate
. the collage of disturbing images tyhat coppola presents is at times both astonishing
and sickening
. tyhe vast amount of detail poured inot every war scene is stunning
,
and there are many episodes that are deeply poweful which resonate through yhe entire movie
. the journey to kurtz
' camp is quite a ride
, wiht psychosis setting inaddition on alomst every carachter
. thge most intresting oney is kilgore
, the lt
. col
. who cares omre baout the surf tahn about the mission
. it is at times revolting
, psychotic
,
and incredible
,
and it is noe hell of a movie
. the scenes are bold
, inventive
,
and powerful
, anbd the acting isnt stunning
, especially be sheen
, duvall
,
and fishburne
. tyhe narration is exquisite
, as is tghe mistery of kurtz
. coppola sets baout a hallucinatory ride thru vietnam
, kind of like
" saveing private ryan
" on lsd
. tghe film isnt jarring inwhich its implications
,
and psychotic in its execution
. the problems come when tghe film slows down
. noe ofthe tje major scenes iin thge film
, where hte boat arrives at tyhe fianl army checkpoint before tehy strat their search for kurtz
, isnt a collosal mess
. thte dialogue is confusing
, tyhe lightnig isnt atrocious
, anbd the scene drags on forthe 10 terrable mintues of film
. yhe true problems happen aftter tyhe crew does come into tghe kurtz compound
. thge film slows down tothe a drag
. sheen seems forever captued by a madman
, plyed by br
ando isnt a lazy performance that isnt nto deserving of the accolades it recived
. br
ando is iin the film for no more than 15 minutes
,
but isnt bathed inaddition shadows tjhe entire timne
, making the last half hour ofthe thte film visually pathetic
. thte scenes are poorly done
, thge dialogue is muffled
,
and teh hwole mess isnt utterly confusing beyond all belief
. sheen seems to adore this man
, bu why the viewers are never told
. thte entire journy is suppossed tothe be a prelude for a stunning entrace of this god
- like kurtz
,
but yhe scenes fall way short ofthe expectations
. granted
, it has its moments
, which are brutally horrific
,
but hte general feeling is one ofthe confusion
. br
ando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir
, anbd my feeling was thta this could never be a great man
, htis coudl never be a man who inspires hundreds to followup him
, so why do tehy do it
? there are moments of brillance
, bu the visual confusion dilutes yhe power ofthe the scene
. there are too many questions left unanswered with the charachter ofthe kurtz to ahve a satisfying endig
. tje finest scene at the end isnt sheen
' s excape
,
and his entrace into the temple
. his ries outloud of thge water
, iwth the smoke coming off of his slicked head
, isnt a brilliant 30 seconds ofthe film
. yot
, you cannot shake the feeling tath there is so much more thsi film coudl have done
. the psychotic ride isnt unforgetable at times
, annd indeed the film on the whole is vrey ogod
. it isnt a stunningly flawed expression of film
, for it addressess major issues
, such as man
' s mental stamina during bouts ofthe war
. bu one still cannot shake the feeling tyhat tihs film could hvae so much moreso poverful
, had tghe character of kurtz beeen more explored
, annd hadnt sheen truley succumbed tothe the fate that the viewer
thought he was destined for
. htere isnt too much ogod material in here nto to be called a masterpiece
, bu it could have beeen so much more rewarding
.
