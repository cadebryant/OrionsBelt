steven spielberg ' s second epic film onthe world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece ofthe film
. spielberg
, ever tghe student onthe film
, has managed to resurrect tjhe war genre by producing one ofthe its grittiest
,
annd most powerfull entries
. he alsot managed to casted htis era ' s greatest answer tothe jimmy stewart
, tom hanks
, who delivers a peformance that is nothing short ofthe an astonishing miracle
. for baout 160 out of its 170 mintues
,
" saveing private ryan
" isnt flawless
. literally
. the plot is simple enough
. after the epic d
- day invasion
( whose sequences are nothing short ofthe spectauclar
)
, capt
. john miller
( hanks
)
annd his team are forced to serach for a pvt
. james ryan
( damon
)
, whose brothers have all died inwhich battle
. once tehy find him
, tehy are to bring him back for immediate discharge so thta he cxan go hmeo
. accompanying miller are his crew
, played iwth astonishing perfection by a gropu ofthe character actors taht are simply sensational
. barry pepper
, adam goldberg
, vin diesal
, giovanni ribisi
, davies
,
and burns are the team sent to fidn oen man
,
adn bring him home
. tyhe battle sequences that bookend the film are extrordinary
. literally
. there is nothing inspite film that hasnt ever been recorded that will prepare you forthe yhe sheer onslaught ofthe terrorizing voilence in the film ' s first 20 mintues
. spielberg films alomst the entire movie wihtout music
, leaving it uv to tjhe charachters to ganerate emotion
,
annd htey dont tothe perfection
. the sequences in france
, all ofthe them
, beginnig with tghe battle
anbd ending whith the battle
, are fabulous
, especially the dialogues between the men as they walk thru the hills
annd countrysides
, trying tothe save private ryan
. there are no words i cxan ule tothe discribe the true horror
adn power of theese sequences
. tihs is waht coppola was looking for in
" apocalypse now
"
,
but couldn ' t create
. thte sheer horror of these sequences all
bu condem war
. yhe peformance by hanks as the leader of tihs gang is allso extrordinary
. he is head
and shoulders above ofthe the rest ofthe tyhe actors inaddition thge world
, with his comic timing
, dramatic flair
, his quiet emotion that stirrs an entire nation tothe tears
. hanks is thsi ocuntry ' s finest actr
,
anbd he proves it here
.
howver
, spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece
. iwth a chance to make it yhe one ofthe the greatest films ofthe all time
, spielberg creates 10 mintues ofthe purely worthless film
. the sequence involving army chief
- of
- stafff george marshall
annd mrs
. ryan is decent
,
bu doesn ' t hold up to tghe rest ofthe tghe film
, relying on wartime cliches to pwoer it
.
but taht is forgivable
. what isn ' t is the bookends ofthe the film
, thte cemetary sequences
. tghe first oen isnt quite ogod
, a decent introduction into the lives of these men
. the lastest sequence is atrocious
. the forced emotion
, accompanyed by a ridiculous piece ofthe music
, is simpley horrable compaired to tje rest of yhe magical film
. these flaws are what downgrade
" ryan
" ffrom tjhe greatest film of our era
, tothe hte greatest war film ofthe our era
. spielberg shoudl have trusted his own material
,
annd he shouldnt ahev trusted hanks to deliver teh most chilling line ofthe tghe movei
, tothe end his masterpiece right there
. the use of tghe flag
,
though patriotic
, is inthe contrast tothe yhe movei ' s theme
. teh pwoer ofthe tghe bulk ofthe thte film
,
however
, is astonishing
. spielberg hasnt truley made a wonderous wokr of art
, that persists even aftter first viewing of the film
, isnt extrodinary
. this is tyhe film ofthe tghe yera
