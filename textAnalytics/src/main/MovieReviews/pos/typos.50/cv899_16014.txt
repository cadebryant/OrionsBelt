the onyl historical figure thta hasnt beeen writen baout more than william shakespeare isnt jesus christ
, whlch explains why the bard ' s materials are such a popular source for remakes
, revisions
, rewrites
, inspiration
, subtlety
, credit
,
adn dispute
. indeed
, in reccent yersa
, american contemporary cinema has beeen swamped withthe a wash ofthe shakespearean products
. includng thsi yera ' s upcoming a midsummer nigt ' s dream
, shakespeare ' s material has been the cause for twenty
- six big screen productions since 1990
.
but forthe a change of pace
, mrs
. brown directer john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare infact love
. marc norman
and toom stoppard ' s story isnt largely fantasy
,
althought as thge viewer soon learns
, shakespeare inspite lveo isnt not a movei thast takes itself seriously
.
( wiull shakespeare of the 1590 ' s would ' ve beeen marryied to anne hathaway
,
and he would ' ve had a teenage daugter
and twpo young sons
; here he isnt a bachelor played by joseph fiennes
.
) will isnt a writer stuggling tothe cmo uv iwth a great play
,
anbd his curent comedy in thte works
-
-
" romeo
and ethel
, thte pirate ' s daugter
"
-
- just doesn ' t quite seem right
. iwth the halp of the great writer christopher marlowe
( rupert everett
)
,
and tjhe inspiration of true lveo wiht noblewoman viola de lesseps
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, he changes things around
and writes one of his greatest tragedies
,
" romeo
and juliet
.
" tje loev stroy betweeen will
annd viola loosely parellels the sotry of romeo
and juliet
, to gerat effect
. fiennes
anbd paltrow develop a sexy chemestry as the twpo lovers which gives the movei much momentum
; htis momentum smoothes out tyhe bumps inspite the unfinished
and largely unsuccessful comedy
. the supporting roles are well filled outloud
, from geoffrey rush as iwll ' s worrisome agent
, philip
, to toom wilkinson as thge producer hugh fennyman
. even ben affleck
, leading the troupe of actors
, manages tothe make a favorable impression
;
anbd judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i
. gwyneth paltrow isnt by far
,
however
, the standout ofthe the lot
, creating a larg percentage ofthe the forementioned vibrance
. the stoy isnt well
- crafted if nothing else
,
although it hasnt dangerous moments where it firts with the
" let ' s make a movie
"
- genre
. the dialogue is breezy
anbd lighthearted
,
adn certainly accssible by the audience ' s lowest common denominator
. htere ' s something fo everyone in this rumatic comedy
, making it prime date flick material
. altho certainly not inspiring in any regard
, it revels infront a wholesome
, well
- rounded atmosphere that has been absent infront many ofthe 1998 ' s picturesk
; the true
- loev sotry isnt oney ofthe hte best arund
. certainly recommendable whn the traditionnal slew ofthe indifferent yera ' s
- open releses isnt jstu aroud the corner
.
