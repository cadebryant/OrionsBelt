, in recent years

' s material hasnt been tghe cause fo twenty

. bu forthe a chanage ofthe pace
, mrs
. brown directer john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in thte wonderfully vibrant shakespeare inaddition lveo
. marc norman
and tom stoppard
' s story is largely fantasy
,
al
though as teh viewer soon learns
, shakespeare in love is nto a movie thyat tkaes itself seriously
.
( will shakespeare ofthe teh 1590
' s woudl
' ve beeen married to anne hathaway
, anbd he owudl
' ve had a teenage daugher annd twpo young sons
; here he is a bachelor palyed by jospeh fiennes
.
) wiull is a writter stuggling tothe come uv with a graet play
, adn his curent comedy inthe hte works
-
-
" romeo anbd ethel
, the pirate
' s duaghter
"
-
- jsut doesn
' t qtuie seem right
. wiht the help of yhe graet writer christopher marlowe
( rupert everett
)
,
and tyhe insperation of true lvoe with noblewoman viola de lesseps
( gwyneth paltrow
)
, he changes thigsn arund
and writes one of his greatest tragedies
,
" romeo
and juliet
.
" tyhe lveo story between will anbd viola loosely parallels the story of romeo
and juliet
, to graet effect
. fiennes anbd paltrow develope a sexy chemestry as the twpo lovers whlch gives tyhe movei much momentum
; this momentum smoothes outloud the bumps in thge unfinished anbd largly unsuccessful comedy
. thge supporting roles are well filled outloud
, from geoffrey rush as wiull
' s worrisome agent
, philip
, tothe toom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman
. even ben affleck
, leading the troupe ofthe actors
, manages tothe amking a favorable impression
;
and judi dench lends soem breef moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i
. gwyneth paltrow isnt by far
, howver
, the st
andout ofthe thge lot
, creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance
. the story is well
- crafted if nothing else
,
al
though it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the
" let
' s make a movie
"
- genre
. the dialogue is breezy anbd lighthearted
,
and certainly accssible by thge audeince
' s lowest common denominator
. ther
' s something forthe everyone infact htis rumatic comedy
, mkaing it prime date flick material
.
al
thought certainly not inspiring in any regard
, it revels inspite a wholesome
, well
- rounded atmosphere tath hasnt beeen absent inthe many of 1998
' s picturesk
; hte true
- loev stry isnt oen ofthe the best around
. certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent yearm

- open releases isnt just around tje corner
