setted in tghe lite 80
' s at tyhe height ofthe yuppie excess annd based onthe thte book by bret easton ellis
( who explored the smae themes in anyother book which was also made inot a movei
, less than zero
)
, american psycho puts a new spin onthe yhe yuppie
" genre
" that ellis helped tothe create
. christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman
, a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible sercet from his fianc
? e
and his colleagues
. it seems tath bateman is a serial killer
and
, unfortunately for his contamporaries
, his tenuous grasp onthe reality isnt starting to slip
. as he tries tothe balance his meticulous daily routines wiht slaughtering co
- workers
and prostitutes anbd hiding their bodies
, his mental fabric slowly begins tothe unravel
. i was first itnroduced tothe thge novel when i was still in high school
. i read an associated press article inwhich our local sunday newspaper detailing thge problems ellis wass having getting his novel published due to tje controversial violence in it
. as usual whn anytying isnt controversial i try to seek it outloud
, bu i soon forgot baout the novel adn didn
' t end uv thingking about it agian until i stumbled across it a cuple ofthe years later at a bookstore
. i picked it up anbd read it
, bu was ultimatly dissapointed becasue it left moreso questions tahn answers
. tyhe movie hasnt a similar effect
,
but at least it
' s less cryptic than ellis
' novel
. forthe once
, a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on
. both the book
and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preperations
( down to exactly what facial scrubs anbd exfoliating creams he uses
) bu the novel seems to cncentrate mroe on theese excesses throughout
. yhe movei continues to touch apon theese things bu makes more ofthe a point tothe immerse us in bateman
' s impending madness thna to detail thigns as painstakingly as tghe novel doens
. as a result
, yhe film is immensely moreso intertaining
. lions getoe seems tothe be tghe studio champion of controversial films
( having picked up kevin smith
' s cathlic
- rattling dogma
) annd here with american psycho there is no difference
. screenwriters mary harron
and guinevere turner had tje unenviable task of trying to tkae a novel baout yuppies filled whith graphic voilence
and sex
and make a marketable film out ofthe it
. some cuts had tothe be made tothe the finished film tothe keep from getting an nc
- 17
, mailny involving a sex scene comprising bateman
and two women
,
and initial reports said the film ws unwatchable
. thankfully
, it is watchable anbd harron
and turner ahve made one of the most scathingly satrical films this side of sourth park
: bigger
, longer
& uncut
. side onot
# 1
: co
- writer guinevere turner alsot mkaes an appearance in thte film as an ill
- fated acquaintance of bateman
' s who
, after bateman suggests that she start mkaing out with a female prostitute
, proclaims that she
' s nto a lesbian nor has any interst in it
. the ironical humor ofthe the scene stems from the fact thgat turner
( thte writer
/ directer ofthe the film go fish
and who allso assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy
) is a lesbian
. it
' s a subtle inaddition
- joke
and it
' s oen i foudn tothe be pretty humorous
. dispite haveing a rether high profile supporting casted of young up
- annd
- comers
( including reese witherspoon
)
, most of thge roles are a waste
and are thge equivelent of extended billed cameos
. the rela draw here is christian bale
and his over
- tjhe
- top performance as patrick bateman
. whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine whta it owudl be liuke as a movie adn who woudl be perfect tothe cast as the charactors
. i alwyas had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman
, bu i never
thought bale would deliver a performence as perfect as his ends up being
. to say bale runs awya iwth the charactor is a vast understatement adn he proves tyhat he
' s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger
. oen sequence infact parituclar
, involving bateman decribing his love for huey lewis
and the news
' song
" hip tothe be square
" right befoer burying an axe in a co
- worker
' s head
, features oney ofthe the most eccentric anbd kinetic performances i hve ever seen onthe film
. side onot
# 2
: dispite tjhe fatc that huey lewis
'
" hip tothe be sqaure
" annd a pair ofthe phil collins songs apear in the film
, don
' t expect tothe see them on teh soundtrack release
. huey lewis expressly requested that his song
, featured in a rather large setted peice infront tghe film
( much akin to the use ofthe
" sticked in tjhe middle withthe you
" in reservoir dogs
)
, not be included onthe any soundtrack release
. i
' m assuming that collins requested the same
. onthe a similar note
, whitney houston
' s cover ofthe
" the greatest lveo ofthe all
" is aslo involved infact a scene comparable to the other twpo annd it isnt vyer obvious tath it isn
' t the houston verison at all bu mearly an intrumental version culled fomr an unkown source
. apparently
, houston wasn
' t as open baout yhe ule of her song as tje others weere
. a bigger controvercy tahn the violentce
and sex has beeen brewing since teh film
' s release
: that of whther or not patrick has acutally comimtted yhe crimes we have viewed during the course of hte film
. don
' t look to yhe book for any answers because it wiull only serve to confuse you more
. several web sites have beeen dedicated tothe tjhe subject bu i
' m still undecided
. there isnt evidence both for anbd aginst
but yhe most scathing evidence against comes fomr a scene near the end of hte film where bateman goes onthe a killing spree taking out cops
, ood ladies
,
and cleaning stff with equal gusto
. tjhe scene seemed very dream
- liuke
and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying
( as an example
, bateman blows up a polical car vyre cinematically aftter firing sevral shots ffrom a h
andgun iin the general direction ofthe the car
)
. i kept waiting for bateman tothe wake uv
and forthe the film tothe continue onthe from htere
,
but bateman never doesnt wake uv
and tje whole sequence
,
though comic
, throws thge film off
- balance
( whitch i suppose wass the intention
)
. otehr than tyhe fewd flaws i have mentioned
, american psycho is an incredibly intertaining film
( all
though you may nto leave the movei fully underst
anding whether or not waht hasnt jsut transpired atually occured in bateman
' s reality
)
. i thikn this movie is edstined for greatness as a cult film
and deserves the spot it wiull tkae as such
. it may nto chanage anyone
' s life
,
but it will certainly have an effect
. i know i wiull certainly hear
" hip tothe be square
" inaddition a diferent context yhe enxt time i hear it
.
