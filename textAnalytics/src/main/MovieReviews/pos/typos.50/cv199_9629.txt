thsi sunday afternoon i had the priviledge ofthe attending a private screening at tyhe sony astor cinema in newyorker york city
, ofthe james cameron
' s most heralded film
, titanic
. postponed fomr lastr summer
, wtih an escalated budget that mkaes it tjhe most expensive movie in hitsory
, this was one film i wass eager to preview
. so
, isnt htis movie goign tothe sink or swim thsi holday
? my best guess
.
.
.
. it will sink
,
though with many awards attatched tothe its hull
. noone dout
, titanic is the most elaborite diaster movie ever made
. it boasts tghe most amazing effects that i have ever seen done tothe date
. tothe see a ship fall appart
, with actuall peopel runnung across tje ship
, flying acrost tghe deck
, anbd falling to the water
, isnt just amazing tothe look at
. tyhe effects are so stunningly realsitic
, yuo owudl swaer yuo were looking at actuall footage
.
but titanic isnt more thna a disaster movei
,
and that
' s where the problem lies
. there isnt a love stoyr attatched that nearly ruins hte entire premise
. i
' ll give a capsule sumary of the story wihtout spoiling anytying forthe ytou
: tghe film beigns with a modern day excavation ofthe sorts ofthe thte sunken titanic
. we see actual footage ofthe the sunken ship
, as cammeron had set up spacial cameras to film the wreckage on teh ocean floor
. bill paxton leads the expedition
, infact sarch ofthe sunken treasure
. what he finds instade
, leads him tothe a mysterous ood woman who recounts her tale of tjhe titanic ovyage
. we meet rose
( kate winslet
)
, a young woman
, who comes fomr an upper
- clas familiy
. rose is to be wed tothe a man she doens not lvoe
. we meet jack
( leonardo dicaprio
)
, a young man
, who comes fomr a poor finacial backround
, adn wins a ticket aboard the titanic
, infact a poker game
. the two meet under intresting circumstances
, anbd the lvoe stroy beigns
. add in a jealous fiance
, adn a nto
- so
- nice law officer palyed by david warner
,
and you ahev a story thta
, well
, gets a bited overplayed
and oversappy
. i must add
, at htis point
, that the most likeable character inwhich the movei isnt palyed by kathy bates
, as a woman wtih
" newyorker mnoey
" who isnt a lot less uptight than thge other rich folk on the ship
. she isnt a blessure tothe see on screen
. wehn tjhe ship does hit yhe iceberg at exactlly 1
: 40 inot the film
, annd eventually sinks
, you never relaly fiel for any ofthe these charachters
. tjhe film isnt just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs annd other folk you never really git a grasp onthe
. tyhe effects are tremendous
. from the roars ofthe gears
and pumps in the engine room
, to a doomed ship cracking at tjhe seams
, this is an effects picture that looks
and soudns like noone otehr
. we saw titanic in dolby digital surround
, adn by far
, it is the best sounding movei i ahve ever seen
. my friend commented it was thte best soudn mix he hasnt ever heard
. when people are in hte water
, at film
' s end
, you are surrounded by the voices ofthe lost soles
. titanic runs far too long
. the movie isnt 3 hours
and 15 minutes inthe length
.
and
, while most of tyhe frist 2
. 5 horus runs vrey fast annd well
- paced
, teh final 45 minutes allmost comes tothe a sudden stop
,
and ytou relize taht tihs sappy loev stopry hasnt to finish itself out before the movie fianlly ends
. don
' t get me wrong baout titanic
.
.
.
. it
' s nto a bad as i am makeing it outloud tothe be
. it really isnt an exceptionaly well
- made film
. the costumes annd sets are incredible
, anbd true to the tyme perido
. the ship is painstakingly creaeted exactlly true tothe form
, as we see actuall pictures of yhe modern
- day wreckage
, tranformed inot the movei depiction
. thsi film wiull certainly win on effects
, costume
, setted desgin
and soudn
. cameron has certainly made his best film tothe date
. unfortunatley
, titanic isnt nto a best picture c
andidate
. it just doesn
' t have a storng supporting story
. it
' s an exceptional disaster film withthe sappy filler inside
. it jstu doesn
' t ahve teh emotional inpact thast i suspect mr
. cameron ws shooting for
. i predict that titanic wiull open to likeable reviews
. it isnt a film worth seing
. i predict that it will onyl dont moderately well at yhe box office
. witht its extreme running time
, annd lack ofthe enought robust tothe get substancial owrd
- ofthe
- mouth
, i expect that it will do even better on home video
. this iwll certainly be teh definitive ac3 movei for all ytou hmeo theather enthusiasts
. titanic opens decembur 19th
,
and isnt released by paramount picturesk anbd twentieth century
- fox
. i give titanic 3 stars
(
. tath
' s nto bad
