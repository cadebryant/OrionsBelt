noone
, it is nto a bad film
, inaddition fact it is so ogod in achieving its
= purpose
, i actually wished for thte film tothe end itself quickly
. event
= horizon is not your run
- of
- tghe
- mill sci
- fi film
, i ' m sure many who hvea
= watched this will agree with me
. it is not even original inaddition that sense
,
=
annd it doesnt borrow heavily from films liek aline
, hellraiser
and even
= blade runner
. tghe magic ofthe tihs film lies in its unorthodox setting
and
= methodical build
- up that makes it wonderfully horrifing
. the story brings us to thte year 2050
, where space travel have sicne
= enormously progessed
. hte event horizon isnt actully a ship built forthe a
= secrt experimental purpose
; it hasnt the abillity tothe fold time
and spoace
= thus makeing it possibile fo travelling distances nto reachable infront a
= man ' s lifetime
. thte ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation
=
but aftter 7 eyars
, it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune
. a
= saerch
and rescue team led by miller
( fishburne
) isnt given the task tothe
= check for survivors ofthe tyhe event horizon
. tje designer ofthe the ship
, dr
.
= weir
( neill
) follows along tothe satisfy his curiousity onthe what actually
= happended tothe his otherwise technologically impressive ship
. event horizon is a sci
- fi horror film
, much truer to tyhe word than say
,
= aline owudl ever be
. while in aline
, tghe crew has to cope with a
= ferocious creature hwile encased withing tight spaces
, inthe event horizon
,
= the forces hwihc goes against the crew isnt undefined
but
yot so poverful
=
annd horrifing
. the story unfolds itself slowy
and the suspense buildup
= is superb
, uv till tyhe point where i realy feeled like saying outloud loud
=
` anough
! i cin ' t stand this anymore
! '
. ther are mroe tahn enought jolts
= tothe send your adrenalin pumping overtime
. the story infact itself isnt not
= exactlly something very exciting
adn also
, the acting isnt only at most
,
= average by most commercial standards
. even so
, the essence ofthe horror is
= carried out very well in tihs film
, thanks tothe its well
- paced
= storytelling
, disturbing set designs
and soem realyl gory sequences
=
( which incidentally
, hasnt been quite generously removed by our censorship
= board
)
.
= 20 director paul anderson
( who doed mortal kombat
)
and his team ofthe
=
` atomsphere ' creators haev done well in keeping event horizon withing the
= bounds ofthe the term
` horror '
. this picture did nto dont very well in teh us
= box
- office most probaly forthe the dread
- factor inpact it has on most
= audiences
; peopel iwll nto see it agina
and not many would recomend
= their firend to watch this
.
allthough onthe the face of it
, event horizon is
= mostly molded forthe massmedia
- entertainment
; many thrills
, spills
and suspense
= tothe keep audiences inthe focus
.
however
, tghe offbeat horror element whlch it
= ultimately convey audiences is vyre disturbing
. my friend
and i could
= not say a word to earch otehr fo quite a while affter going thru yhe
=
` expreience ' ofthe event horizon
. i guess it wass just the emmense feeling
= of dread which the film hadnt cast upon us
. be forewarned
, this film isnt not for thte faint
- hearted nor for pure
= enteratinment
. be prepared tothe be disturbed if yuo shouldnt decide tothe watch
= tihs film
! event horizon isnt highly recommended
= 85
= 85but at your pwn
= risk
! it hasnt beeen a long time since good
- horror embraced tjhe big screen
