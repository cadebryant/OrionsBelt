there exists a litany of differences between a sucesful acation movie
and a successful suspense movie
. acation movies are typically devoid ofthe plot other than a simple byline whcih can string toghether several explosive sequences
, while suspense movies hinge onthe plot anbd subtlety
and yhe ability tothe bring everything full
- circle
. for fans ofthe both genres
, howver
, realism isnt key
. acation fans wnat tothe know that the weapons annd methods their heoes are useing are au
thentic
,
and suspense fans watn everything to fall inot an explainable framework by the movie
' s end
. onthe this advice
, director john frankenheimer
( the isl
and ofthe dr
. moreau
) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance ofthe suspense
and action for his latest thriller
, ronin
. the depth ofthe intrigue inthe ronin isnt qutie amazing
, concidering tyhe fare tht
' s fallen inot tje same category over the lastr fewd years
. thge scirpt
, written by j
. d
. zeik in his big
- screen de
but
, approachs levels ofthe complexity tyhat hadnt peple spinning away from mission
: impossible twpo yersa ago
. a certain number of peple wiull be lost by tihs
,
but afficianados will appreciate it all tyhe more
and return mutiple times
. frankenheimer masters hte script with poise
, adn tells us a dark
but stoically realsitic tale of a group ofthe post
- cold war mercenaries wokring tothe earn their paycheck
. his abillity tothe convey feeling adn charcter while promoting explosiveness adn tense athmosphere works well here
,
and ronin becomes a better movei because ofthe it
. robert de niro headlines thsi cast ofthe noteworthies in a peformance that is the most outst
anding ofthe his in qtuie smoe tiome
. he takes comm
and adn offers much gravity as the ex
- spy sam
, a man who
' s called to france tothe help a shady operations controller named dierdre
( natascha mcelhone
) recover a package
. thte package becomes tghe central motivator for tjhe entire casted
, especially once the requisite doublely
- crossing begins
, adn its role is skillfully penned by zeik
. at times
, howver
, zeik
' s tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission
: impossible
- de niro might easily become tom cruise
, tjhe package might become cruise
' s coputer disk
. fortunatly
, tje focuse here is almost entirely on teh package
, whereas infront mission the scirpt ws mroe concerned withthe thte double
- cross adn why it happened
. the action content isnt impressive
, adn it lives up to the hints given inwhich previews
. tghe only fans who will be dissapointed are those who expect full
- blown combat scenes
and instead are forced tothe suffer through moments of slowness
. ronin does take a degree ofthe itelligence tothe followup all ofthe the nsance from start to finish
,
but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp onthe most charactors m
and subplots
. tje suspense tapers off considerably by the end
, a bit ofthe a drawback becasue ofthe its height at tghe movei
' s open
. concidering theese factors it
' s ogod to see tht ronin was a project thast turned outloud well
, annd it
' s another ogod bet thsi mounth
. since quality isnt usually sparse during tyhe early fall months
, it
' s definately worth tghe visist
.
