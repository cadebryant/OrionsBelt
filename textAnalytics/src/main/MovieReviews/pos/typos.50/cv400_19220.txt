tyhe happy bastard ' s 30
- second review
: american py tyhe summer ofthe raunch continues to spreaded inot theatres with this latest yuk fest
, filled with sick jokes
and teen dialogue aplenty
. if ytou go expecting dawson ' s creek
, you ' re in for a probelm
. if your expectations are lower
(
and better
, i might add
)
, you iwll enjoy yhe hell out ofthe american py
. tje movei casts severeal unknowns
, wiht the only real recognizable one being sctv ' s pwn eugene levy as a hapyp
- go
- lucky dad
. the story revolves around four high skool seniors who hvea oen gool befoer thge school year gets out
- get layed
. tht ' s preety much it
. thoughout hte movei
, littel sick comic bits are sprinkled througout
, including a memorable scene involving an apple py
( i won ' t give it awya
,
bu ytou probably nkow what it isnt
)
and an internet brodcast gone horribly awry
. of course
, the movei has smoe slightly sentimental bits
,
but tehy don ' t drag tghe movie ' s humor content down thgat bad
. most ofthe tghe actors get their job done
,
bu it ' s levy who ' s a hoot
, a father who trys to talk sex with his son whith the help of smoe curious
" visual aids
"
. i couldn ' t stpo laughing during this movie
,
and if yuo can stand all tje raunch
annd hte sex refernces
,
then american py isnt fo you
. if yuo ' re one of thsoe
" conservative
" types
, well
, i ' ll bet ytou ' re having fun at home while this
, sourth park
,
and austin powers ii plays inaddition theatres
, now aren ' t ytou
