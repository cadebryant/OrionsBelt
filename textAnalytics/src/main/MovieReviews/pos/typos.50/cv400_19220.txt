the happy bastard
' s 30
- second review
: american pie the summer of raunch continues to spreaded inot theatres withthe this latest yuk fest
, filled wtih sick jokes anbd teen dialogue aplenty
. if you go expecting dawson
' s creek
, you
' re inspite for a problem
. if your expectations are lower
( anbd better
, i might add
)
, yuo will enjoy the hell outloud of american py
. hte movie casts several unknowns
, wiht the onyl rela recognizable one being sctv
' s own eugene levy as a hapyp
- go
- lucky dad
. the stopry revolves around four high school seniors who ahev oney gool before the school yearm gets outloud
- get layed
. thast
' s pretty much it
. throughout the movei
, littel sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout
, inlcuding a memorable scene involving an aple py
( i won
' t give it awya
,
but you probablly nkwo what it isnt
)
and an internet broadcasted gone horribly awry
. ofthe course
, the movei hasnt soem slightly sentimental bits
, bu they don
' t drag teh movie
' s humer content down that bad
. most of the actors get thier job done
,
but it
' s levy who
' s a hoot
, a father who tries to talk sex with his son withthe hte help ofthe some curious
" visual aids
"
. i couldn
' t stpo laughing during thsi movei
,
and if you cin st
and all the raunch anbd thte sex refernces
,
then american pie is for ytou
. if you
' re oney ofthe those
" conservative
" types
, well
, i
' ll bet you
' re haveing funn at hmeo hwile thsi
, sourth park
, annd austin powers ii plays in theatres
, nowe aren
' t you
