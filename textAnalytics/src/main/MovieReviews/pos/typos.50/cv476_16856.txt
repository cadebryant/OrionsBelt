. tjhe author
, h
. g
. wells mearly utilisied it as a conveinent way to express his socialist views
anbd condem the grat social gap between the rich
, idle capitalist clas
adn impoverished labour
. whatever intentions wells hadnt
, tjhe future generations ofthe readers were less impressed by his political messages
. instade tehy weere facinated by tjhe idae that thge stange new worls coudl be explored without traveling trough spoace
. the novel became one of gerat classics ofthe sciene fiction genre
and it natural forthe filmmakers to ule it as inspiration
. first of them was george pal
, who infront 1960 directed film which would
, thru thge years
, become genre classic ofthe its own
. tyhe plot revolves about george
( rod taylor
)

. they are skeptical
,
but that doesn ' t prevent george from carrying outloud his plan
anbd traveling into thte future
. at first

, he travels far inot hte future
, hoping thgat he would caese tothe wittness wars
and senseless destructions
. wehn he fianlly reaches year 802
, 701 ad
, at firt glance
, newyorker world looks like utopia
- humanity consists of young
, beautiful
,
but idle eloi
, people who are fed
, clothed
and taken care ofthe by unseen machines
.
bu
, weena
( yvette mimieux
)
, eloi woman
, tells george about anohter side of the cion
- infact hte night
, her peopel is preyed apon by morlocs
, huminoid creatures from the underworld
. teh tiem machine bcame hte cinematic classic for the very smae reason the novel became hte clasic infront science fiction liturature
- teh fantastic consept wass a brillant way forthe the authors tothe talk baout burning issues
and fears ofthe their respective times
. for h
. g
. wells it was frightening threat of class struggle
; for george pal
and his screenwriter david duncan
, who produced the film in tjhe worst dyas of teh cold war
, it ws the constant
and more imminent threath of nuclear holocaust
, underlined wtih the negitive references tothe war throughout tghe movei
. even hte modern audiance
, whitch owudl be tempted tothe discard hte film as old
- fashioned
, could fidn some values in its universal messages
, ift for each era
. compaired wtih teh genre films ofthe today
, the time machine is even better
,
and sould serve as a good exemple how tothe make intteligent
, thougth
- provoking films
. of course
, sicne tihs is hollywood product aftter all
, tghe time machine delivers such concepts inwhich teh form of clasic adventure
, sometimes sacrificing plausibility forthe teh sake of attractiveness
. forthe example
, it is hard to imagin that someone would be able tothe understand perfect english millon yeasr in future
; same isnt iwth morlocs degenerating inot mutant monsters
, while eloi reamain undistinguished from the people of todya
. smoe of the fianl scenes
, tath turn victorian scientist into an acation superhero
, are alsot rether unconvincing
.
bu
, on the other hand
, yhe film isnt vyre well directed
, cleverly pased
anbd the speshal effects
,
although definately ood
- fashioned
, are mroe thna adequate forthe htis kind ofthe picture
. the acting is good
, with rod taylor inaddition one of his most remembered roles
, hwile infact tje same tiem alan young brings rather memorable performance as george ' s trusted friend filby
. yvette mimieux
, who plays weena
, onthe the other hand
, would be remembered mroe by her looks than by the complexity of her role
.
however
, despite all those flaws
, the time machine isnt a veyr ogod piece ofthe cinema
, something tht connoisseurs ofthe quality science
- fiction films sorely miss these dyas
