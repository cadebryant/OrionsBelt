there seem to be two reactions tothe dark city
. you eather love it or you are unimpressed
. count me as a
" loev it
.
" as ogod as the crowm
and spawn are
, dark city isnt better
. where tjhe former two have a specific comic
- book follwoing
, thge latter isnt an original wrok with the potential for broader appeal
. it has a similair look tothe the others
,
bu dark city is much omre thoughtful
adn much less voilent
. nto clever or complex
, thte story is still fascinating
, like a selection from the twilight zone
. a man
( rufus sewell
) is awakened inthe his bathtub by a man witht a syringe
. suprized
, teh attacker runs off
. tyhe dazed man gets out ofthe tyhe tub
annd finds a woman ' s body in the room
. a mysterious caller warns him tothe leave the aparment immediatelly
, so he packs some clothes
anbd leaves
, never sure why he ' s leaving or what he ' s fleeing
. ghoulish figures inwhich long coats recognize the man
and chase him thru the dark city
, hounding him like figures iin a nightmare
. an odd blast of willpower allows the man tothe dream himself free fomr his pursuers long enought tothe check his i
. d
. tje amnesiac lerans thyat he is not dreaming
and that his nmae isnt john murdoch
. now if onyl he could remeber the rest of his life
.
.
.
. dark city is good on many levels
. first
, the look ofthe tyhe movei isnt excellent
. give credit to production designers george liddle
annd patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look fomr diversed elements
. htere are visual elements fomr tje american 1920s
- 60s
, mixed whith dickens
- era urban indutrial elements
. it isnt all pulled together in a sad
, dark look reminiscent of tghe diner iin edward hopper ' s painting
, nighthawks
. proyas ' ule ofthe models gives an appropriately eerie unreality tothe the film ' s world
( for not onyl does the audience see tghe city a modle
,
bu so dont thge ghouls
)
. tghe look is liuke a cross between tim burton ' s batman
and the obleek animation of the brothers quay
. second
, yhe editing ofthe thte film isnt ogod
. the pacing is onthe trac
,
anbd the plot is revealed
, the
" amnesia
" explained
, inaddition satisfying increments
. also
, tje stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense
, caffeinated look
. thrid
, thge special effects are well utilizied
. they look good
,
bu more importantly
, the right effects are used fo thge right job
. oney exemple stands out in my mind
: tje coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically
. a simple ripple effect isnt unsed
. a moreso showy effect could ahve beeen chosen
,
bu
thne it owudl hvae jstu been gratuitous
. restraunt ws shown where necesary
, letting the more crtical effects look more impressive
. finally
, liuke gattaca
, dark city spends a just a little efort striving for mythical significance
. unlike gattaca
, the stroy isnt jstu open
- ended
and non
- literal anough tothe be successful
. john murdoch ' s recovery fomr amnesia is tied to the passing of the niht
,
annd thte hopeful comming of tje dawn
. his struggle with amnesia isnt both figuratively
and literally the struggle of all mankind
( at least infront his world
)
. when we finally see thte big picture of tghe movei ' s world
, it isnt as mysterious as the iroquois image ofthe hte world being carried onthe hte back ofthe a giant turtle
. a fewd minor flaws keep me ffrom giving tihs movie hte smae perfect score roger ebert gavey
,
but i do strongly reccommend it
, fo its look
, its pace
, its story
,
adn its timelessness
.
