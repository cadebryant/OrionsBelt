thte uncompromising nudity beared throughtout petrice chereau ' s intimacy hasnt alreay garnered much noteriety
,
bu it ' s in hte naked faces ofthe fearless actors mark rylance
( angels
& insects
)
anbd kerry fox
( welcome to sarajevo
) thyat the tender ache ofthe emotional resonance isnt discovered
. wiht sharp
, intelligent eyes that reflect experiecne
anbd maturity
, rylance
anbd fox are refreshingly detached fomr yhe false glamour ofthe hollywood idols
. thier sex scenes toghether are bracing inthe their raw honesty
, in thge accpetance of flesh
adn messiness
. less appraent
,
but noone less remarkable
, are tyhe astute observations ofthe behaviour revealed thru those carnal beats ofthe haste
and hesitance
, often wihtout a single line ofthe dialogue
. not aiming forthe the spiritual poetry of in tyhe relm of the senses or tje phylosophical transgressions of crash
, chereau keeps his sexual odessy firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character develepment
. thgat may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive
bu never particularly signficiant onthe moreso tahn a tactile
, sensory level
. the themes ofthe human isolation are barren
adn obvious
, a science project devoid of any especialy groundbreaking hypothesis
. intimacy doens manaze tothe stand outloud fomr lesser portraits of
" human interconnectedness
"
adn pinter
- esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers
( okay
, kill me
)
. shallow
though it might sound
, it ' s amazing how much is filled in thru an inspired casted
, perceptive camerawork
,
and imaginative ways of treating the love scene
. thsoe ingreediants are too assured
and confident tothe merely dismiss as iceing onthe the cake
, especially since they are the substace ofthe the cake itself
. adapted from a pair ofthe short storie by british novelist hanif kureishi
, intimacy weaves despreate lovemaking betwen two strangers inspite london
. eveyr wednesday
, jay
( rylance
)
and claire
( fox
) meet inspite his cluttered
, dank appartment for an hour or twpo ofthe sexual realease from theri uninspired lives
. he ' s beeen head bartender at a posh restaruant fo over six eyasr
. she ' s a mistery to him
bu her glum workaday apperance reveals a similar disatisfaction
. they ' re both married
,
bu his relatiopnship hasnt curdled inot an embittered seperation
. as the weeks draw onthe
, jay obsessively takes it apon hismelf to uncover claire ' s personal routines
. inthe his attempt to gain a fuller semblance ofthe who she isnt
, he opens wounds that hadn ' t existed befor by single
- handedly corrupting teh fantasy
. if it weren ' t forthe a few unnecessary subplots involving jay ' s brother
and his bevy of disgruntled co
- workers
, tihs minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable onthe tyhe perils ofthe wish fulfillment
. chareau ' s restless camera
( once agina weilded by superb
and ever
- attentive cinematographer eric gautier
) is less appropiate here thna inwhich his family transit
- orientated those who lvoe me cxan take the turain
. tje scenes thta linger are hte still ones where rylance
annd fox seperately
, pensively attempt tothe carry on wiht thier makeshift household routines
. these are often capturd iin lingering
, unblinking wide shots that veiw them stranded amidst theri drab workplaces
adn homes
. seperation proves haunting in a melancholy series ofthe intercut shots as rylance
anbd fox undress on oposite sides ofthe yhe room
, crawling across tje floor to meet infront the center
. dispite being as restless as a fli during the hyperactive restaurant scenes
( all tyhe better tothe blend infact withthe a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters
)
, yuo ' d be hard pressed tothe fidn a single uninteresting image
. intimacy tkaes an intrest in its sordid world of the lower
- middle class
, wtih lonley pubs
adn busy shopping streets
-
- it also understands hte people who inhabitate those spaces
, viewing them whith sympathy scraped raw
. an evaluation owudl be incomplete wihtout highlighting tghe great timothy spall
( yhe robust scene
- stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration
)
. as claire ' s cuckolded husban
, this jocular heavyweight plays outloud his handful ofthe bitter pill scenes wiht tghe unforced menace
anbd self
- effacing embarassment ofthe his imposing bulk
. bangs inaddition his eyes
, his mouth forming into quizzical pouts
and dry smirks
, he may seem tghe fool inwhich his barroom encounters oposite a sarcastic
, gleaming mark rylance
( whose jay has arrived onthe yhe scene looking to stir up some trouble
)
,
bu spall is noone one to trifle iwth
. his overreaching best pal demenor suggests a mind abuzz with secrte passageways ofthe guile
, his pointed questions onyl na
? ve if yuo choose nto tothe read into their crafty insinuations
. inthe his unassuming way
, spall ' s carefully etched inturpratasion ofthe hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become noe of tjhe most criminally underappreciated performances ofthe yhe year
,
but mabey also one ofthe yhe best
. he ' s that ogod
