hte uncompromising nudity beared throughtout petrice chereau
' s intimacy hasnt already garnered much notoriety
, bu it
' s in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance
( angels
& insects
) annd kerry fox
( welcome to sarajevo
) that the tender ache ofthe emotional resonance is discovered
. withthe sharp
, intteligent eyes taht refect experence
and maturity
, rylance annd fox are refreshingly detatched fomr tghe false glamour of hollywood idols
. their sex scenes toghether are bracing inaddition their raw honesty
, in teh acceptance of flesh
and messiness
. less apparent
, bu noone less remarkable
, are tjhe astute observations ofthe behavior revealed through those carnal beats ofthe haste anbd hesitance
, oftenly without a single line ofthe dialogue
. not aiming fo the spriritual poetry ofthe in the relm ofthe the senses or the philosophical transgressions of kresh
, chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward charater devolopement
. tath may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive
but never particularly signficant onthe mroe tahn a tactile
, sensory level
. thte themes ofthe human isolation are barren annd obvious
, a scinece project devoid ofthe any especialy groundbreaking hypothesis
. intimacy doens manage tothe st
and outloud ffrom lesser portraits ofthe
" human interconnectedness
"
and pinter
- esque rummages through pyschological dirty drawers
( okay
, kill me
)
. shallow
though it might sound
, it
' s amazing how much is filled iin through an inpsired cast
, perceptive camerawork
,
and imaginative ways ofthe treating the love scene
. thsoe ingreediants are too assured
and confident tothe merely dismiss as iceing onthe the cake
, especially since htey are yhe substace ofthe the cake itself
. adapted ffrom a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi
, intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london
. every wednesday
, jay
( rylance
)
and claire
( fox
) meet iin his cluttered
, dank apartment for an hour or two ofthe sexual release ffrom their uninspired lives
. he
' s beeen head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years
. she
' s a mystery tothe him bu her glum workaday appeareance reveals a similar dissatisfaction
. they
' re both marryed
,
but his relatiopnship has curdled inot an embittered separation
. as the weeks draw onthe
, jay obsessively takes it apon himself to uncover claire
' s personal routines
. iin his attempt tothe gain a fuller semblance of who she isnt
, he opens wounds that hadn

- h
andedly corrupting tyhe fantasy
. if it weren
' t forthe a faw unecessary subplots involving jay
' s brother
and his bevy ofthe disgruntled co

, this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable onthe tghe perils of wish fulfillment
. chareau
' s restless camera
( once again wielded by superb
and ever
- attentive cinematographer eric gautier
) isnt less apropriate here than inspite his family transit
- oriented thsoe who love me can tkae tyhe turain
. the scenes thgat linger are tyhe still ones where rylance adn fox seperately
, pensively attemt to cary onthe whith their makeshift household routines
. theese are oftenly captued inwhich lingering
, unblinking wide shots that veiw them str
anded amidst thier drab workplaces annd homes
. seperation proves haunting inspite a melancholy serieses ofthe intercut shots as rylance
and fox undress onthe opposite sides of the room
, crawling acrost the floor tothe meet in the center
. despite being as restless as a fli during thge hyperactive restaurant scenes
( all teh better tothe blend in witht a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters
)
, ytou

, viewing them whith sympathy scraped raw
. an evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting tghe graet timothy spall
( the robust scene
- stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration
)
. as claire
' s cuckolded husban
, this jocular heavyweight plays out his h
andful of bitter pill scenes withthe thte unforced menace adn self
- effacing embarrassment ofthe his imposing bulk
. bangs in his eyes
, his mouth forming inot quizzical pouts adn dry smirks
, he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic
, gleaming mark rylance
( whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble
)
, bu spall is noone oney tothe trifle wih
. his overreaching best pal damenor suggests a mind abuzz whith secret passageways of guile
, his pointed questions onyl na
? ve if you choose nto tothe read inot their crafty insinuations
. iin his unassuming way
, spall
' s carefully etched intepretation of hostility burried under a mountain ofthe surface propriety may become noe ofthe the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year
