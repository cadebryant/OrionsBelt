natural born killers is really a veyr simple storey tht
, in essence
, has allready been told inthe bonnie
& clyde withthe smoe major variations in emphasis
, mood adn degree
. both films glamorize
" outlaws
,
" in oney case bank robbers
and killers
and iin thte otehr massmedia murderers
. both relate the sotry ofthe a cuple liberated by love
.
but where bonnie
& clyde wass partial
and subtle
, natural born killers is total anbd blatant
. where bonnie
& clyde was social
, natural born killers isnt pyschological
. what bonnie
& clyde hinted at
, naturual born killers confronts annd explores
. waht bonnie adn clyde stole
, mickey
and mallory kill
. to examine natrual born killers as nothing more than a pyschological odyssey ofthe relization annd exposure ofthe the frauds surrounding them
, exressed metaphorically as killing
, subdues the mysterious power htis film wields
. for the most part
, when mickey
and mallory kill
, they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily
, they kill waht is trying to kill them
, tehy kill what dissembles
and cowers fomr life
, htey kill what needs to be killed
. this mythos is at least as ood as hte hindu trinity
. brahma created
. vishnu preserved
. adn siva destroyed
, bu he destroyed waht needed tothe be destroyed tothe amke way for the usefull creations ofthe brahma
. the folowing may be painfully mundane bu metaphorically so accurate
, i
' m forced to say it forthe clarity
' s sake
: a plumber must remove the ood lead
and ocpper pipes
, that isnt
, destroy tyhe old plumbing sytem in order tothe replace it wiht tyhe new oen made ofthe plastics
. your plumber
, bonnie anbd clyde
, mickey
and mallory
,
and siva are all productive destroyers
. i think yuo could sday wihtout much of a challenge that religeon isnt responsible forthe more killing
and death
, presently
and historically
, thna any other phenomena
. muslims kill christians
. hindus kill muslims
. christians kill pagans
. jews kill christians
, etc
. you coudl reverse subject annd predicate in earch instance
and still nto be challanged
. religion is an orgy of killing
. the institution of tghe state onyl misses firt place for technical reasons like it hasn
' t been a major palyer fo as long or yhe twpo are frequently indistinguishable
.
" tje state is the divine diea apon earth
,
" hegel said
, meaning it is absolute
, all
- poverful
, ineffable
, unassailable
, infallible
, authoritarian
and patriarchal just liek jhvh
, allah
, god
, etc
. well
, what does all tihs hvea tothe do with natural born killers
? let me first say that religions ofthe this nature
, in the ideal
, tkae the place of sex
. consider the catholic church
, which inthe its hey
- dey
, tookover religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever
. god takes tyhe place ofthe sex as manifested inthe all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope
, cardinals
, bishops
, monks
, etc
. they forego tghe one
, in order to come closer to tjhe otehr
. during tje middle ages
, wehn this doctrine wass unmitigated
and unchallenged
, tghe most repressive regime the west hasnt ever known infact terms of scope adn magnitude rose tothe pwoer
.
( parenthetically
, wittness plato as well
. infact the republic
, he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime
. nto coincidentally he was something ofthe a mistic hismelf
, regularly assailing tjhe passions
.
) catholicism
, as policy
, attacks the passions as evil
. it sees intercourse onyl as a means tothe perpetuate thge speices not as a way to pleasure
. masturbation is considered a sin wiht thte sacrament of penance nessecary fo absolution
. this is religon
, this is authoritarianism iin its essense
. as further evidence
, the nazis hadnt tyhe same attitudes as the church onthe theese matters
. our culture
, most of tyhe cultures ofthe yhe world have been steeped in this tradition for thous
ands of eyars
. we cxan
' t help bu adopt
, even internalize soem ofthe theese same authoritarian attitudes
, leading tothe a destructive split betweeen the biological annd social self
. mickey adn mallory knox internalized them
, too
, thn thru spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one ofthe them by tjhe presence of tje otehr
, discovered them
, adn began expurgating them fomr themslves annd ffrom the world in tyhe proccess unifying themselves
. it is a straightforward liberation through sex
. as some ogod patriarch once observed
,
" yuo cin maintain controll as long as everyone keesh their clothes onthe
.
" m
& m hadnt a vision ofthe waht tghe world owudl be like without contradictions
. tehy saw what civilization
and culture
and everyday life would be like under such condidtions
.
" hte moent ofthe realization is worth a thous
and prayers
,
" as mickey says
. as a the most consistent
and impassioned criteak of western culture there is nietzsche applying his tipical stridency tothe the marter
: let us look each other inaddition tyhe face
. we are hyberboreans
-
- we know well anough how remote our palce is
.
" neither by l
and nor by water iwll you fidn the road tothe the hyberboreans
"
: even pindar
, in his day
, knew thyat much baout us
. beyond tghe noth
, beyond ice
, beyond death
-
- our life
, our happiness
.
.
.
. we haev discovered thast happiness
; we nkwo the way
; we got our knowlege ofthe it fomr thous
ands of yersa inwhich thte labyrinth
. who alse hasnt foudn it
?
-
- the man of todya
?
-
-
" i don
' t know eather the way outloud or the way in
; i am whatever doesn
' t knwo either the way out or the way in
"
-
- so sighs thge man ofthe today
.
.
.
. tihs isnt the sort of modernity that made us ill
-
- we sickened infront lazy peace
, cowardly comprimise
, the hwole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea anbd nay
. htis tolerence
and largeur ofthe the heart thast
" forgives
" everthing because it
" underst
ands
" everthing isnt a sirocco tothe us
. rather live amid tghe ice than amoung modern virtues annd other such sourth
- winds
! as far as i can tell
, htis is what the movei hasnt to say
. its alleged critique of the media is only secondary
, tertiary
, quaternary
, subsidiary fo sure
. for example wayne gayle
' s first report ends with smoe gen x dued saying
,
" if i weere a mass murderer i
' d be mickey adn mallory
,
" in his most excellent bill
and ted voice
. onthe one level you cd make tje humdrum obervation tyhat baceause the media had glamorized theese two psychopaths that tjhe uncritical
, impressionable gen x dumb guy confused thte marter
and tookover them forthe heroes
. it seems more likely tyhat he made an independent judgement at a subconscious levle recognizing what m
& m weere up tothe
and confessing that if he had yhe balls to be so honest with hismelf he
' d be jsut liek them
, killing
and destroying whta deserves it
. let me exemplify whta i
' ve been saying by analyzing a scene from tyhe film
, namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant
, kills him
, annd
then castigates him fo giving her
" tghe worst fuckin
' head i
' ve ever had inthe my life
!
!
!
" now
, i never claimed that mickey
and mallory hadnt a perfect relationship
, because demonstrably they didn
' t
,
and this scene anbd the ones leading up tothe it sohw us this
. sometimes tehy are the source ofthe eahc others frustrations
,
but unwilling to kill earch otehr
, sicne tehy loev earch other so much anbd are responsible for earch others liberation
, they must kill inwhich palce of their lever
. it
' s noone secret taht inthe tihs scene mallory fantasized tht her victim was mickey
. as the attendant approached he took on mickey
' s character in tje eyes of mallory
. she needed to kill him beacuse of he kidnapped thta girl in teh hotel room
and wass hvaing secert fantasies baout her while making love to mallory
. apon discovery
, mallory views this as a betrayal
, judges him
,
and commutes his sentence onthe somone else
. the sytle ofthe the movei isnt a whole
' nother matter that i won
' t git into very deeply bu surelly it isnt partially reponsible forthe its pwoer
. let me just say taht its editting hasnt tghe opposite effect ofthe a western with shots that linger forever onthe a salon enterance or the liek suggesting tje expansiveness
, barreness anbd boredom of the frontier lifestyle
. tjhe rapid succesion of all those 8mm
, 16mm
, 35mm images from varios perspectives with a soundtrack somtimes infront sync anbd sometimes outloud ofthe sink instills a skittish
, frenetic mood
. also
, jungian archtypes abound
. these can
' t halp bu trigger deepo psychological responses we can barely underst
and especially wehn they flash accross tjhe screen fo barely a faw frames
. some ofthe the best scenes anbd lines thta come to mind
.
( qoutes are paraphrased onyl
)
: mickey to mallory
:
" oen ofthe these days i
' m gonna be cummin
' forthe yuo
,
" in prision
, while mallory jacks mickey off
. semen isnt a symbol for great potential
and thigns tothe come
. at the tiome tehy haven
' t yot had sex nor have they killed anyone yot
. thge twpo ofthe course go h
and inspite h
and
. forthe an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs
. mickey during his marriage to mallory
:
" as creater of my universe
, i pronounce us man adn wief
.
" the way woody delivers htis line is truely haunting
, bu telling
, too
. it reveals m
& m are well on thier way tothe expunging all theri destructive tendencies
and replacing them wiht positive ones
. this isnt wqat mickey means by
" creater of my universe
,
" he isnt giving himselv or creating fo himself healthy attitudes
. it isnt not nessasarily a schizophrenic retreat inot solipsism as it first appears
. scagnetti
' s frist meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from tjhe gas staion attendent
' s mouth
. tyhe indian sage releasing mallory
' s father
, who was reincarnated as a snake
:
" ood man
, go be a snake
,
" after telling his
" snake story
" that ends with
" bitch
, you knew i wass a snake
.
" after mickey shoots this sage tothe death during a bewildering nightmare
, mallory sasy
,
" you killed life
!
!
!
" this isnt another telling qoute baceause it implies tehy didn
' t see themselves as killers of life
.
then whta weere tehy killing up to thast timne
? in smoe case just those zombies faking their way through life
, tghe living dead
, as it were
. in otehr cases
, all yhe anti
- life forces
, the cops adn their parents
. the
butterfli just before tjhe movie shifts inot the prison
. it ofthe course symbolizes rebirth
. dr
. emil reingold
, as portrayed by steven wright
, passing judgement onthe m
& m
:
" mickey annd mallory nkow the diference between right annd wrong
, htey jsut don
' t give a damn
.
" this is reminisent of nietzsche
' s wohle philosophy
,
and maybe a direct refrence tothe his beyond good
and evil
. mickey
:
" tghe rabit syas teh moment ofthe realization isnt worth 1000 prayers
.
" mickey
( again in his interview
)
:
" me anbd yuo
, we are nto hte smae species
.
" notice whn the escape isnt in progress we git some role reversals infact terms of leadership
and control
. mickey the prisoner becomes the leader ofthe his littel gang
. tje wardens become prisoners
and the civilians like wayne gayle
and his producer folow tghe leader
, noone marter who it isnt
. mickey
: how ya feelin
'
? wayne
: fucking great
! mickey
: you got the feelin
'
? wayne
: i
' m alive
. i
' m alive fo teh firt fuckin
' time
! wqat an incredible transformaton thsi isnt
. he got thge feeling
and he couldn
' t contain himself
. what a feeling
. tath feeling of mataphysical freedom taht yuo cin create your pwn universe
. mickey whn almost caught infact a dead end
,
" htink
, think
, tihkn
, thiunk
.
" go figure it outloud
. dwight
( tommy lee jones
) inaddition general
, becouse he may be tjhe sickest fuck inwhich the whole film
. his wohle attitude can be summed up whith
,
" distroy them
!
!
!
