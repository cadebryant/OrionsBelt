on the basis ofthe this film alone
, i never woudl have predicted that
, infront twpo eyars
, quentin tarantino would become the ocuntry
' s biggest hotshot director
. reservor dogs has hints of the tarantino brilliance that emerged infact pulp fiction
,
but is a much less substantive
, mroe conventional crime stoy than tje big pf
. here
' s what tyhe twpo movies do hvea infact common
.
.
.
-
- scenes of intelligent
, amusing dialogue iwth noone relevence tothe the plot
-
- a story that jumps back anbd forth in time rather than goign inthe a logical
, chronological sequence
-
- graphic yot necessary violence
-
- an engaging crime story
-
- dialogue liberally spiced with swear words
and racial
/ gender slurs
-
- threee ofthe the smae actors
( harvey keitel
, tim roth annd steve buscemi
)
-
- a mexican st
andoff ending
,
al
thought thsi one isnt considerably less optomistic tahn pf resevoir dogs isnt an entire hour shorter tahn pulp fiction beccause it
' s onyl got oney story tothe tell rather thna three
. crime lord joe cabot
( veteran actor lawrence tierney
) hasnt assembled five criminals who have never even met eahc otehr to pull a dimond store heist
. thte five are instructed nto to reveal thier real names or personal details or anything tjhe cops could use if one ofthe them was captured anbd interrogated
. instade
, htey are all given code names off the color chart
-
- mr
. white
( keitel
)
, mr
. pink
( buscemi
)
, mr
. orange
( roth
)
, mr
. blonde
( michael madsen
)
, mr
. brown
( tarantino
) anbd mr
. peach
( tarantino
' s chin
)
. most of the movie
' s running tiem isnt spended wih mr
. white annd pink waiting at a warehouse fo thte others tothe arrive
. mr
. orange
, meanwhile
, isnt onthe teh floor
, dying ffrom a gunshot wound
. the polical hadnt arrived at the scene of tje crime way too soon
, leading white to believe oney ofthe the five was an informant
. the story
' s backround unfolds through a serieses of flashbacks
, ofthe tjhe crime itself annd thte meetings vetween joe
and the criminals prior to teh crime
. eventually
, blonde arrives with a polical officer hostage
, anbd what follows isnt a truely brutal
, uncomfortable torture scene
. let
' s jstu say picasso owudl be inspired by what blonde does to the cop
' s ear
. a lot of yhe time
, reservor dogs seems like your typcial ganster heist
- gone
- wrong movei
, bu ther are a fewd sequences that are uniquely tarantino
. tghe oppening scene infront tje coffee shop starts the movei off onthe a high onot tghe rest of it doesn
' t live uv to
, as hte criminals plus joe have a conversation on
, among otehr things
, tipping philosphies anbd their interpretations of madonna
' s
" liek a virgina
.
" anohter scene involves roth
' s lengthy manufatured stor baout runnung into a group of cops adn a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana
. neither of these hvae much plot relevance
but are given ample tyme tothe deveop
, liek the captain koons gold watch speach in pulp fiction
, onyl here these sequences are mroe enjoyable than tyhe rest of the movei
. reservoir dogs is ogod
but it
' s noone pulp fiction
.
