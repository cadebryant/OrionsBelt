. ytou realyl can
' t meet a person onthe htis green earth who has not seen
' clerks
'
. it was hailed by critics as oen ofthe yhe best movies ofthe tyhe yera annd soon a sequal isnt coming
. in 1995 kevin made another movei
' mallrats
' thta flopped horribly
, throught it was not thge best movie ever made it was a pretty ogod little flick
. it was panned by critics
but hailed by audiences
and inspite 1997
' chasing amy
' came outloud anbd wass kevin
' s biggest success to date
. nowe inaddition 1999 we git a graet little movie by the nmae ofthe
' dogma
'
. wow
! what a cast
. ok here is the plot inwhich this movie
: linda fiorentino plays a regluar woman who works at an abortion clinic
. oen day at her hous metatron
( the voice ofthe god
) appears at her house much tothe her surprise
and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels
( matt damon
and ben affleck
) from getting bakc into heaven by ways ofthe a church
. ok now get thsi
, she isnt told tothe find two prophets
: one who talks a lot
and one who doesn
' t
, howver she gets jay anbd silent bob instade
( who give us great performances
)
. nowe on her way tothe newyorker jersey witht jay adn silent bob to try annd stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky
( chris rock
)
and helps giude her tothe fidn theese angels
. salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out allong her way
. azrael
( jason lee
) who isnt a demon isnt trying tothe halp the two angels outloud so taht they cin win
. bethany
( linda fiorentino
) has tothe now use the halp of all theese peple to try
and stpo thge angels befoer tehy cheat thier way bakc to heaven leading tothe a voilent
and bloody end that will make you tihkn twice baout your faith
. what a movie
, it isnt everthing rolled inot oen
: an offensive
, offbeat
, smart anbd sassy comedy that surprisingly hasnt a graet message at thge end
,
and ends uv being a feel
- ogod movei
. who owudl have known kevin had such a soft side on him that sould amke us nkow that he is a faithful person himself
. now forthe those of yuo who get offended whith tihs movie really should not tkae it tothe heart
. yes it may target tyhe cathlic community annd bash them a lot
, bu it alsot seems to rather than go against god
and heaven
, it actually goes with god annd kevin gives a message that there isnt a god
. tihs review may sound confusing at frist
but really tyhe onyl way to underst
and it isnt to see htis exellent movei
. kevin goes to new lengths inwhich this hilarious comedy
and gives us smoe graet cahracters wtih nto too much background or study
and rather we start tothe know teh charachters as we watch tghe movie
. of course the best
( anbd funniest
) ofthe them all isnt the only duo inspite istory thyat have made me fall out of my chair laughing
and that my firends are jay
and silent bob
. probably the best characters in movies tath i like
. tje star
- studded casted isnt amazing
and has some other cameos by george carlin
, jeanne garafolo
and so may moreso that we start tothe lose tarck aftter a hwile
. hte script was writed by kevin smith with many f
' words inwhich there of course
and a strong emphasis onthe sexual talk
but he also seems tothe concenrate onthe what isnt importan rether thgat what isn
' t
and makes us laff at the same tiome as we thiunk
. chris rock gives a hilarious performance
and gets into his character veyr well
, wiht some clasic lines
. linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role
and mkaes us elieve tath she really isnt who she isnt
. ofthe course jason mewes adn kevin smith do a great job as jay adn silent bob with some priceless lines ffrom jay
( as well as silent bob
)
. alan rickman
, jason lee
, salma hayek round outloud the casted with matt damon annd ben affleck inaddition teh starring roles
. bieng oscar winners for the classic
' good will hunting
' htey give grat performances here again bu matt damon seems just a little held bakc
and to me doed nto give it all he could
. ben
however was all out
and got veyr much inot his charater as well as the stor
. tjhe movei
' s onyl big flaw isnt that it hasnt a faw unfunny lines
and some slow parts to go allong with it
. howver the direction by kevin
and tghe scirpt by kevin as well as yhe priceless performence by many ofthe yhe cast munbers
,
' dogma
' st
ands as a new classic
and i tihkn i can safetly compare it tothe
' clerks
'
. hwile bieng funny at times
, in the end it becomes a serious movei with an important message thyat soem may nto agree withthe bu can
' t deny it
.
' dogma
' wiull offend peopel
, especially deeply religious peopel
, bu forthe those ofthe you who are oepn minded annd want to see some very funny material thn this is the movie forthe yuo
. all kevin smith fans must see
