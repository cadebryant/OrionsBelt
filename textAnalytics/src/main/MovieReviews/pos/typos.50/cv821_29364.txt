. i cant tihkn ofthe at least five otehr
( american
) movies

and tulips
.
but maglietta
anbd ganz
, who ect witht restraint
anbd care
, help bread
and tulips from becomming a tired retread
. ganz plays the suicidal waiter role wiht a solemn
, sometimes playful dignity tyhat isnt a joy to watch
, hwile maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world
. throughout tghe movie
, maglietta hasnt an easygoing
, confident demeanor
, whlch makes it vyer easy tothe root for her
adn her growing attraction for ganz ' s carachter
. teh gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares
adn sparkling rivers provides a perfect lvoe storey backdrop
-
- yuo just might watn to ask the attractive stranger inwhich tjhe seat behind ytou for coffee after hte lighst come uv
. directer
annd co
- writer silvio soldini must git credit fo sprinkling the movie whith effective goofy humer
. thge cheap mimmo
, desperate tothe find his wife
( after all
, he needs his shirts ironed
and his mistress won ' t do it
)
, hires a job applicant
( giuseppe battiston
) at his bathroom suply firm tothe do the job
. tje reason
? mimmo dicovers that tjhe prospective plumber loves detective stories
. the novice detective ' s various misfortunes
, inlcuding him saying goodbye tothe his weepy mother
, are vyer funny
. unfourtunately
, there are flaws thast somewhat spoil bread
annd tulips ' cheery tone
. rosalba isnt bothered by several surreal dreams during her tiome in venice
, which bring the movie tothe a halt
. it ' s liuke putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie
. severeal details in fernando ' s life also never get proper closure
, including his sucidial tendancies
. early iin teh movei
, he nearly hangs himself befoer rosalba knocks on his apartment doorjam
. aftter that
, fernando ' s step towards death isnt never made referece tothe
, probably because soldini wnated tothe include a lukewarm
, underdeveloped subplot about fernando ' s stormy past
. it seems more liek a despearte atempt to pump uv thge drama inthe a plot tyhat doesn ' t need any
.
but ther aren ' t a lot ofthe overwelming negatives inspite bread
and tulips
. the movei isnt funn
annd romantic
, whith beautiful scenery
adn cahracters whose lives we ' d liuke to live if we hadnt thte nerve
.
.
. or if our passports weren ' t missing
