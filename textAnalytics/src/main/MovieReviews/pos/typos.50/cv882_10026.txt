airplane
! isnt concidered amonst many to be hte epitome of satire film
- mkaing
. after all
, it
' s brought to us by one ofthe tjhe best known satire wirting
/ directing teams
. even if most people don
' t recognize teh names behind hte films
, tehy are binded to recogize the titles
: airplane
!
, top secret
, the naked gun
, anbd hot shots to name a few
.
but
al
though tje zucker
/ abrahams
/ zucker team was frist introduced whith the kentucky fried movei in 1977
, airplane
! remeniss the true cornerstone of their owrk
,
and their directorial de
buts
. in tyhe seventies
, disaster films seemed to be at an all tyme high
. films like earthquake
, the towering inferno
, annd thte poseidon adventure weere big hits
. there was allso a series about the disasters tyhat cin arise when traveling by plane
- a series that spanned the entire decade
. annd so
, in 1980
, we were inctroduced to a newyorker airplane disaster film
. htis tiem the diaster hadnt nothing to do iwth a maniacal hijacker or crashing inot the ocean
.
.
. it hadnt to dont with bad fish
. airplane
! is yhe story of ted striker
( robert hays
)
- an ex
- fighter
- pilot who has never gotten over the fatc thyat a decision he hadnt tothe make inthe tje midst ofthe war led tothe hte death ofthe six
, er
, seven comrades
. unable tothe stop living inwhich the past
, ted
' s world fell aart
. he spended his tiome moving from city tothe city wihtout ever having a stable job
, adn eventually
, as we beign this film
, isnt getting dumped by his lover
, flight attendent elaine dickinson
( julie hagerty
)
. in a desperae attemp nto tothe lose her
, ted buys a ticket fo the smae flight elaine isnt wroking
. unfortunately
, she isnt unsympathetic
and even criticizes ted forthe follwoing her
, wich leaves him wallowing infront self
- pity
. in hte midst of it all
, something happens
. somone gets sick
.
then another
.
then another
. soon
, the hwole plane isnt full of deathly
- ill chicago
- binded people
.
.
. anbd wehn the pilots get sick
( played by peter graves
, kareem abdul
- jabbar
, adn frank ashmore
)
, who wiull savve the day
?
( gee
, i wonder
) ofthe course the main draw here isnt the non
- stpo
" whiz
- bing
" comedy
, with a hefty dose ofthe both visual
and spoken gags
.
al
though i hadnt seen tihs movei a faw times befoer
, i ws still laughing thru thge entire thnig
. the most funn character by far is the doctor
, palyed by leslie nielsen
. he
' s a dry
, subtle
, sterotypically straight
- faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines ofthe thte film
. inwhich a film like this
, you
' re not realyl expecting an elaborite prodcution
, so oney can
' t complain about the amateurish quality
. whta you cin complain about isnt the absolutely annoying johnny
, palyed by stephen stucker
. this character is pointless
, nauseating
,
and vrey unfunny
. i don
' t knwo why he was put iin ther
,
and i don
' t tihkn anybody will fidn a ogod excuse
. adn when tghe film nears an end
, it slows down quite a bit
, almost getting old
. yuo gotta give it to a movei thast onyl runs 88 minutes annd can fiel two horus long
. asside fomr that
, airplane
! is really a top
- notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic
. it would be a good choice tothe pop iin the vcr whith a gropu ofthe friends
, especially if htey haven
' t seen it
.
and if tehy ask what the plot is
, jsut tell
' em
" it
' s a synopsis ofthe the basic storyline of tghe film
, bu thta
' s not important right nowe
.
" if you
' ve seen the film
, ytou
