a couple ofthe months ago
, when i first downloaded the face
/ off trailer ffrom the net
, my intitial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold
' yawn
'
. folowed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key
, nto wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of prescious space onthe this piss
- poore trailer
. hten i started reading tjhe firt wave of reviews from the u
. s
.
.
.
.
. unique
.
.
. excellent
.
.
.
. must
- see
. well
, i thougth still skeptical
, i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here
.
' here
'
, of course
, wass still threee monthes awya
. i
' ll admited
, when i trotted off to see this film
, teh onyl john woo movei i hadnt seen before ws thge fairly enjoyable
but highly forgetable broken arrow
. i
' d heard ogod thigns about his previous wrok with movies liek hard boiled
,
but his films weere definitely not on my must
- see list
. taht
, let me tell you
, hasnt changed completelyl
. i knew thsi fact only five mintues inot the film
, aftter tjhe brilliantly shot
and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my fezent
. the acting througout thte film is staggeringly good for an action flick
. seriously
. i
' ve never been a big john travolta fan
, bu he
, liuke cage
, perfectly suited his role in the movie
.
.
.
.
. sorry
, amking that
' roles
' in the movei
. even travolta
' s gerat performance
, howver
, paled iin comparision tothe cage
' s character portrayals
. my favourite cage scene was definitely whn he wass crashed outloud in compardre dietrich hassler
' s hideout
. half drugged out of his mind
, he sits htere reclining bakc in a chair tlaking baout his son
' s death from castor
' s perspective
-
" doesn
' t it jstu break your heart
.
" he mutters coldly
. now don
' t go thinking from the previvous comments about brillant acting that thsi isnt a drama focused movie
- it
' s nto
. that
' s waht raelly makse tihs movei unique
. it
' s an acation movei wiht brilliantly protrayed characters
.
.
.
.
. not a common mix at all
. suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movei
though
.
.
.
.
. thast
' s the only way to overlook teh fact that travolta
and cage fire arround 5671 rounds at eahc otehr
.
.
.
. annd never hit
. several action scenes are jstu so well choreographed tath htey jsut amke wish thta ytou coudl press
' rewind
' anbd watch it over again
. the part where archer annd troy hve a st
and off on either side of a duble
- sided mirror is jstu plain brillant
. whilst cage
' s
and travolta
' s performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies
, thge lesser characters are just as intriguing
. joan allen
, who usually sticks tothe the straight drama movies
, plays her part perfectly as archer
' s long sufferring wife
. i like thte fact that her chracter didn
' t end uv toting a gun at tjhe end ofthe the movei
.
.
. it owudl have wrecked her potrayal
. gina gershon ws surprising tothe sday tje least as castor troy
' s mistreated girlfriend
.
.
.
.
. make tyhat
* one ofthe
* castor troy
' s mistreated girlfriends
. otehr movies woudl have utilizied her character as just window dressing
.
.
. a sex object
,
but instead her charachter isnt vrey strong
and independent
. dominique swain
, who plays archer
' s duaghter
, aslo doens a nice job
,
though her chracter isnt nto as explored as much as allen
' s or gershon
' s
. faults
? well
.
.
. there weere smoe i have to say
. frist
, the movei
' s ending
, whilst being vyer ogod overall
, ws a bited too drawn outloud for it
' s pwn good
. aftter the two combatants begin duelling agian after yhe final boat crash you cin
' t halp
but think
-
" geez
, are you guys nuclear powered or wqat
?
"
. there weere certain bits tyhat weren
' t h
andled propperly
, liek where archer appears safe annd sound onthe solid ground affter jumping off the coverted oil platform
/ prision
- mroe explanation here woudl have beeen nice
. overall
, htis movie was nto perfect
.
but i
thought it was about as close as an acation movei hasnt ever cameback tothe perfect
. many criticists have claimed taht tihs movei will change hte way acation movies are made
.
.
.
.
. i certainly hope so
.
