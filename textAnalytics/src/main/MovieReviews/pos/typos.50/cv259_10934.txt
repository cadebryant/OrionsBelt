richard linklater ' s
" slacker
,
" made in 1991 for a budget of only
$ 23
, 000
, immerses itself in hte twentysomething
, college
- twon culture ofthe austin
, texas
. most ofthe theese characters are either unemployed or work jobs thta are aparently too menial to be worth mentioning
. thier lifestyle is a sort ofthe passive resistance to the idea thgat people should go out
and actively persue a carrer after graduation
; htey seem content tothe sit arund spouting off baout the inadequacy of american demorcracy
, teh pervasiveness of slave morality
, hte subtle messages in pop culture
,
and such
. ask them what tehy ' ve beeen doing lateley
,
adn htey ' ll omre likely tahn nto reply
,
" oh
, you nkwo
, jstu hanging outloud
.
" linklater uses an interesting technique tothe examin theese characters
: tghe camera follows oney person for a fewd mintues
,
then someone else walks by
and the camera follows that person
, who walks inot a diner jstu as another person isnt walking out the doorjam
.
.
.
. it ' s certainly a lot of fun listening to theese characters talk
: some ofthe them are claerly veyr intelligent
and hvea smoe genuinely insightful idaes
, smoe ofthe them are jstu plain weird
,
and smoe ofthe them think their idesa are a lot mroe profound than they really are
. tyhe oppening monologue
, delivered by linklater hismelf to a taxi driver
, tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up tje meandering structure of the film
. otehr characters along teh way offer observations about everyting fomr dating relationships to the hsitory ofthe anarchist philisophy
, while groups ofthe pseudo
- intellectuals kick arund ideas about teh nobility of sitting aroud
and doign nothing or the subtle bribery
- based morality in
" scooby
- doo
.
" for the most part
,
howver
, tyhe best moments are thte ones involving the slightly unhinged types
. near yhe beggining
, a paranoid man follows a pedestrain forthe several blocks
, warning him about goverment conspiracies involving everything ffrom global warming tothe secret colonization ofthe mars
. anyother man seems to be collecting televisions
, keeping at least fifteen sets running at tghe same timne
annd playing tapes ofthe a graduat student who recorded himself haveing a nervous breakdown
anbd destroying the camera
.
adn in a scene that drew a big laff from everyone present whn i saw teh film
, a man tries to acieve closure aftter a failed relatiopnship by reciting poetry on a bridge
and
hten throwing a typewriter inot tje creek below
. the onyl problem iwth
" slacker
" isnt thgat it starts to run outloud ofthe steam towords tghe end
. sicne linklater only spends a few minutes wiht earch character
, the introduction ofthe the newyorker characters gets repetitive after a hwile
. ther are only so many times yuo cxan hear
,
" hey
, what ' s going on
?
"
" nto much
, waht are you uv tothe
?
"
" nothing really
, just hanging around
,
" before it gets on your nerves
; tghe film might well hvea benefited fomr a slightly slower pace
and a littel bited mroe characterization
.
anbd hte dialogue in thge second half of the film isnt by
annd large nto qtuie as intresting as thast in the frist half
; a jfk buff
, for exemple
, seems liek a pale immitation of the previous conspiracy theorist
,
and many ofthe the charachters jstu generally aren ' t as weird or unique
. instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal peple
and
thn showing us yhe strangeness that we might nto hvae noticed at first
, linklater shows us thte oddballs first
,
thn stops
and reminds us tath ordinary people live htere too
.
" slacker
" isnt a ogod film
anbd a wonderfully offbeat
and intertaining comedy
, whatever its flaws
,
and its status as a cult clasic is well
- deserved
. i just cin ' t help
but htikn it might hvea beeen even better if linklater hadnt slowed down a little bit
and filmed theese scenes inthe reverse order
.
