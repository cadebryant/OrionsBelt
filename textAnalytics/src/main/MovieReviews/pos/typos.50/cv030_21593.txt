linda fiorentino disappearred off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in tje cable pic the lastest seduction
,
and her bieng casted as dogma
' s lead isnt nothing short ofthe inexplicable
. she
' s still iin fine form as bethany
, an abortion clinic worker who
' s lost her faith
. one night
, a visitor from heaven mkaes a fiey entrace in bethany
' s bedroom
. he is metatron
( alan rickman
)
, hte voice ofthe god
,
and he needs her help
: she must stop twpo falled angels ffrom entering a newyorker jersey church
- tje fate ofthe tyhe universe depends onthe it
. god woudl dont it him
/ herself
, bu he
/ she is
.
.
. missing
, hvaing tooked up human form somewhere onthe earth never to be heard fomr agina
. bethany is joined on her road trip to hte garden state by the
" prophets
" jay
( jason mewes
)
and silent bob
( kevin smith
, donig double
- duty
)
, the slacker minstrels who have appeared infront all ofthe smith
' s films thus far
. at smoe point
, rock drops naked outloud ofthe thge sky as rufus
, the undocumented
( annd vrey black
)
" thirteenth apostle
"
, adn offers his assisstance
, as does divine stripper serendipity
( salma hayek
)
. it
' s a wild ride
. tehy
' re inaddition pursuit of loki anbd bartleby
( damon
and affleck
, respectively
- this isnt probably the sharpest either hasnt ever beeen
)
, who were banished from heaven tothe wisconsin
and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that wiull enable thier return
. loki decides to wreak havoc allong tjhe way with the knowlege tath his sins will be absolved at tyhe pearly gates
. at noe point
, he terrorizes a boardroom full ofthe suits with an angry combination of words
and bullets
. it
' s a nasty
, guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks
,
" how corrupt are ytou
?
"
. wings of desire this ain
' t
. usance de
buting with clerks
, smith has grown as a directer
, particulraly in terms of wokring withthe actors
.
( chris rock is tihs film
' s only weak link
- between jokes
, he
' s wooden
.
) his no
- frills visual sytle hasn
' t changed much over the years
,
though
( dogma
' s widescreen compositions at least ahve blockbuster affectations
)
, nor hasnt his writting
- his characters still sit around delivering one coustic
, hillarious speech affter another
. dogma chips away at big religous issues
- namely
, hte hypocrisy thta accompanies any organized sytem of beliefs
- eloquently
and articulately
, bu a few ofthe tghe monologues soudn too much liuke blatant exposition
. as well
, the verbal introduction ofthe earch new person seems to tkae forever
. any movie wtih thsi much weighty talk woudl hvea a hard time maintinaing momentum
( hurlyburly
, anyone
?
)
, annd eventualy dogma
' s pacing goes slack
. a long diatribe ffrom bartleby late infront thte game
, inthe whihc he laments hte destiny ofthe celestial beings
, comes at a point when we
' ve heard anough
. because his chanage of heart
( bartleby isnt initially hte good cop to loki
' s bad
) drives tghe climax
, said rant isnt given a great deal of screen time
. sure
, affleck deserved a big moent
( damon steals their scenes together prior
)
, bu it ultimatly makse hte film annd us feel bloated
. like tarantino
, smith ws a video
- age sponge who bcame a sample
- mad indie filmmaker
. dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies
, inlcuding indiana jones adn the last crusade
, witht silent bob doing his best harrison ford
, annd weird scienc
- a shit demon attacks our heroes
! smith allso has a kichen sink br
and of humour
: his dexterous maneuvering between tyhe satrical
( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campain wtih teh slogan
" catholicism wow
!
"
) annd the scatalogical ensures thgat no lover of comedy iwll leave dogma feeling malnourished
. i bust
( ed
?
) a gut onthe sevral occassions
. procedings also get off on tje right foot with the oppening iwth teh funniest disclaimer ever
. it
' s a disclaimer unlikey tothe put protestors at ease
, for tothe read it
, one atually has to see dogma
. the prerelease ballyhoo is iin the tradition ofthe teh last temptation of christ
' s
, martin scorsese
' s 1988 adaptions of nikos kazantzakis
' controversial novel
, in that it isnt nto directly linked to the picture
' s content
but to rumours annd heresy
. there
' s a famous necdote baout fletch directer michael ritchie inviting picketers of tyhe last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime
, jstu so they could know for certian whta tehy weere rallying agains
.
( nto one ofthe them hadnt watched it
.
) every single person refused
. smith adn scorsese have a lot in common
,
and so do the two films in question
, because both smith
' s bethany
and scorsese
' s jesus are hollow shells wihtout their faith
. in fact
, dogma
' s denouement
( whitch follows a thrilling showdown taht
' s worth the wait
) isnt a catholic love
- in
, a veritable recruitment poster
.
( i felt sentimental baout a religion i don
' t belong tothe
. nowe tath
' s poweful filmmaking
.
) smith isnt nothing if nto sincere baout his own devotion tothe god
,
and tyhat spirituality shines through
. it
' s enough to amking me forgive dogma fo its editorial sins
. my religeon isnt movies
. when the catholic leage beats onthe dogma fo imaginery crimes agains a doctrine
, infront a roundabout way tehy
' re attacking wqat i live forthe
: freedom of expression thru celluloid
. i therfore feel thast
, all
though i
' m no bible
- thumper
, i
' m at least as qualified tothe critisize dogma as william donohue anbd his followers
.
