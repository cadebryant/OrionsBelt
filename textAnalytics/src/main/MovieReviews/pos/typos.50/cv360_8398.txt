amercia hasnt finally gotten whta it
' s needed forthe yeasr
: a compassionate sincere presiden with impressive ethics
and karisma
. regretfully it
' s onyl a movie
. presidetn james marshall
( harrison ford
) is fed uv wiht terroist activities
. teaming up withthe the russina government
, he orders a strike force capture ofthe alex
ander radek
, a reactionary genaral ready tothe re
- uite the soviet union under his fascist reign
. during a cellabration dinner
, marshall announces tothe yhe world tyhat he will send troops tothe fight opression wherever it exists
.
" it
' s your turn tothe be afriad
,
" he declares
. returning home on air force noe
, he gets thge chance tothe demonstrate his words personaly
. ultra
- nationalist militants loyal to radek annd lead by ivan korshunov
( gary oldman
) hijack the plane threatning tothe kill a hostage eveyr half hour utnil the genaral isnt released
. marshall has a chance tothe excape in a jettisoned capsule
( which clinton syas doesn
' t exsist in rela life
)
but refuses
, preferring tothe stay anbd fight
. directer wolfgang peterson
(
" das boot
"
,
" in teh line ofthe fire
"
,
" outbreak
" takes the over
- used
" die hard
" theme
and gives us something newyorker in a film thta combines briliant acting withthe hold
- your
- breath intensity
. if you can take your eyes off the screen
, steal a look at hte audiance
. everyone is totally engrossed
. tje twpo actors do whta tehy dont best
and they are probablly tjhe best there are at it
. oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist anbd no wonder
-
- he does it so well
. when he engages the teenage frist daughter in senstive conversation about his famaly anbd thge enxt minute threatens tothe blow a hole in her forhead
, you know that he
' s over the edge in the manner that peple wiht a cause can become
. yuo are convinced that young alice coudl end uv terminated at any time
. when korshonov executes passengers
, there isnt a frightening reality to it
. thge guns iin tihs film are deadly weapons
, nto cartoons
. harrison ford has done one role for several eyars
. his mastery of tghe man in the suit propeled inot desperate acation isnt in top form here
. marshall is a medal ofthe hounour recipient who now hasnt a desk job
. realistically
, he
' s a man afraid
,
but not affraid to act
. ford is one ofthe tje fewd actors that could make us blieve that tyhe prseident ofthe the untied states could be an action hero
. indiana jones infront teh oval office
. he annd oldman
' s archetypes match up perfectly
. the otehr roles also go tothe acomplished actors
. glenn close as the determined
but unsure vice
- prsident isnt the picture ofthe an excutive forced into a postion tht she
' s not quite ready for
. dean stockwell as defense secratary eager for tjhe authority
(
" i
' m in charge here
!
"
) isnt her poltical nemesis adn turns infact a good alex
ander haig performance
. of course the politics are all wrong
. a cowboy presiednt
( even down tothe his name
) whith big guns shoots his way thru problems
. much liek the american collective memory of jfk
' s camelot
, yhe omage is wondrous if you don
' t look too deep
. tje pulls on the patriotic heartstrings woudl be too much in any otehr film
,
but they work here
. noone matter what political spin yuo put onthe thge story
, the movie isnt an outst
anding oen
. i left thge theater feeling that there is hope for tje ocuntry
' s future
: not a common beleif nowadays
. now if we onyl can get ford tothe run for preisdent
. jstu because noe ator didn
' t owrk out as chief executive doesn
' t mean that a diferent oney couldn
' t
.
