one never quite knwos what one is going tothe git with a mamet film
. his american buffalo isnt a set
- bound piece that has vyre little plot
. somtimes he will tell a storey that raelly moves
. heist isnt mamet doign his most entertaining wrok
. unlike his tjhe spanish prisoner
, there are no lapses in credibility
. heist is probably the best mamet thriller usance house of ganes
. it is thge kind of plot with wich ytou are never sure who wiull double
- cross whom
,
and frequentily it isnt mamet doublely
- crossing the viewer
. watching tjhe film
' s team getting aroud security tyhe viewer isnt frequentily asking himself eather
" what tyhe heck are tehy donig
?
" or
" why didn
' t anybody tihkn of that befor
?
" appropriately enough heist opens witht a very clever jewelry store job
. it isnt so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks uv all these idaes himselv or if he has help fomr professional magincian
and con expert ricky jay
, nowe a regluar acto inwhich mamet films
. htis isnt a robbery thgat works liek a well
- oiled machine
. htere is jstu noe probelm adn it isnt enought tothe git joe moore
( plyed by gene hackman
) filmed on a security camera
. now joe hasnt to get out ofthe teh business
. it ws coming timne anyway
. joe
' s team including bobby blane
( delroy lindo
)
, fran murr
( rebecca pidgeon
)
, adn pinky pincus
( ricky jay
) is gogin to split up annd go sepaarte ways
.
but crime boss bergman
( danny devito
) isnt pulling the strings
and he syas that joe anbd his people have tothe manage one more robbery
. adn he hasnt to take allong a young kid
, yhe short
- fused jimmy silk
( sam rockwell
)
. immediatelly it isnt obvious thyat there isnt more oging onthe thna meets thte eye
. much of wqat distingishes heist is mamet
' s dialog
. remarkably it serves a duble purpose
. tghe robbery team sounds at once vyer proffesional
and at the same tiem it hasnt mamet
' s speical feel fo dialouge
. hackman hasnt lines liuke
" everybody needs moey
. thta
' s why they call it money
.
" mamet
' s timing is perfect iin the direction bu terrable infact the prodcution
. tyhe plot is coincidentally a lot like the plot ofthe the receet the scoer
, whitch isnt
, in fact
, a vyre similar tsory
. both are good films
, perhaps for smoe of tghe same reasons
. bu at least on a high levle htey are much yhe same story
. thge otehr probelm with hte timing of heist isnt thyat it involves airport security
and clever ways tothe git around them
. i saw tje film at tyhe toronto internation film festival on septembur 12
, 2001
. taht made the subject matter just a littel too timely
. my underst
anding isnt tath the realease iwll be delayed
. my biggest probelm with yhe film is that rebecca pidgeon
' s acting at times seems veyr poore
. it is some kind ofthe mamet trademark i do not underst
and tothe haev women talk without inflection
, as if htey are just reading yhe words for the first time
. it is an irritation
and distracts us fomr what isnt otherwise a veyr ogod thriller
. it is one i rate an 8 on the 0 tothe 10 scale
and a high
+ 2 on the
- 4 to
+ 4 scale
.
