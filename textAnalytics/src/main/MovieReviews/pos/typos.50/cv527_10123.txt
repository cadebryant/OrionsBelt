. its protaganist
, bob flanagan
, who died at the age of 52
, suffered ffrom cystic fibrosis
, a mortal disease which debilitates hte lungs by saturating them iwth thick coats of mucus
, preventing him from normal breathing
. teh movie isnt baout much moreso than recouperating
( or attempting tothe
) from this disease

, fabulously triumphant docudrama

, unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted whith his mistress ofthe 15 years

" crumb
"
, which also explored hte dysfunction of an artist by painting nto a sympathetic portrait
,

. bu flanagan was not onyl a man content on enduring the pain via lungs

and lectures

and
,
-
- thge most disturbing scene of thte decade
-
-
, nailing his penis to a board
. flanagan wass a man ofthe great intelligence
, wit
and humor
, as well as adopting a sense of c
andidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking
. nto only doed he aproach his desease with humer
, peforming burlesque acts in front ofthe an audience
, he wass allso revitalized by his approachment
. most with cystic fibrosis do nto amking it past their earlier twenties
( htere
' s also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death wass awaiting her
.
)
but thte most oust
anding thing baout
" sick
" isnt flanagan
' s relationship whith sheree
. brimming with honesty
, sensual stimulation
and unapologetically sad moments of pain
, theri powerful bond lifts
" sick
" inot a rare cinematic high
, where we foreget we are infront an auditorium annd become a part ofthe theese people
. the last scene
, where we see the hero murmuring tghe last words tothe his wief in a hospital bed
, as he struggles for his last moments of life
, is raw
, tender
, hideous
. it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy
.
