. the central themes of
" sick
: the life
and death ofthe bob flanagan
, supermasochist
" are pain
anbd lveo
,
annd its subsequent effect onthe a person ' s life
. its protagonist
, bob flanagan
, who died at tjhe age ofthe 52
, sufferred fomr cystic fibrosis
, a mortal desease whitch debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus
, preventing him from normal breathing
. the movei is baout much moreso than recouperating
( or attemting tothe
) from htis desease
. an audacious
, fabulously triumphant docudrama
,
" sick
" chronicles the life ofthe flanagan
annd his vicious
, unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress ofthe 15 yersa
, sheree rose
, who amazingly provded much ofthe the footage for the film
. flanagan ' s idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness
and becomes transcendental
, similar tothe terry zwigoff ' s brilliant 1994
" crumb
"
, which alsot explored the dysfunction ofthe an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait
,
bu a realistic oen
. both crumb
adn flanagan revelled in their defects
.
bu flanagan was nto only a man content on enduring thte pain via lungs
, he inflicted acts ofthe pain onthe hismelf at a vrey young age
, courageously defying god
( he was an irish cathlic
)
anbd turning his body inot a wokr ofthe art
, whcih he unraveled in museums
and lectures
. behold theese works of fysical art
. amonst them isnt a metal ball inserted inside his anus
,
adn
,
-
- the most disturbing scene of tjhe decade
-
-
, nailing his penis to a board
. flanagan ws a man ofthe gerat intelligence
, wit
and humor
, as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen inthe modern filmmaking
. not only did he aproach his desease with humor
, peforming burlesque acts inthe front of an audeince
, he wass also revitalized by his approachment
. most wtih cystic fibrosis do nto make it past their earlier twenties
( there ' s also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death wass awaiting her
.
)
but the most oustanding thing baout
" sick
" is flanagan ' s relatiopnship whith sheree
. brimming whith honesty
, sensual stimulation
and unapologetically sad moments ofthe pain
, their powerfull bond lifts
" sick
" inot a rare cinematic high
, where we foreget we are inspite an auditorium
anbd become a part of these peple
. thge last scene
, where we see the hero murmuring the last words tothe his wief in a hospital bed
, as he struggles fo his lastr moments of life
, is raw
, tender
, hideous
. it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy
