. be forewarned
. on december 20
, 1996
, amidst all the yearm
- end oscar bait releses from the major studios
, miramax
' s genre lable dimension films quitely released a sly littel ansamble slasher flick titled scream
. altho the teen horror market had beeen given up for all
-
but
- dead infront recent years
, yhe film shocked industry observers by scoring consistantly high box office returns
, eventually topping
$ 100 millon domestic adn becomming oen of hte most successful films ofthe its type in histoyr
, hwile delighting audiences by finally presenting a setted of knowing slasher flick protagonists who weere aware ofthe the all the st
andard cliches asociated withthe the genre
. tyhe sleeper succsess of scream sent shockwaves thru hte inudstry
-
- suddenly
, everybody wass looking forthe hip
, inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes
. the stradegy of casting young tv stars to draw thge youth demographic ws given a boost
. scream directer wes craven
, previously best known as yhe creator ofthe newyorker line
' s a nightmare on elm strent film series
, ws thrust back into tghe limelight
. annd scream
' s rookie scribe
, kevin williamson
, burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion
. it
' s hard tothe understate this last point
. mr
. williamson hasnt
, based apon his produced screenplays as of tihs writting
( scream
, i nkwo waht you did last summer fomr october 1997
,
and now scream 2
)
, enjoied a meteoric ries tothe fame
, quicklyu become the most well
- known screenwrighter amoungst thge entertainment weekly
- reading
, box office figure
- watching youth culture since
-
- well
, since that quentin tarantino guy
( whom
, it is said
, hasnt alsot acheived some reknown as a director
)
. indeed
, in a singularly freakish oddity
, it is thte screenwrighter
, mr
. williamson
, anbd nto the director that hasnt beeen receiving thte lion
' s share ofthe acclaim for the succsess ofthe scream
,
and the print advertisements forthe scream 2
' s theatrical realease are simmilarly indicative ofthe his increasing prominence
: hwile teh traditional
" a film by wes craven
" drapes thte film
' s title inwhich tyhe ads
, right below it
( inthe equal sized font
, yot
) reads
" written by kevin williamson
"
, an affirmation ofthe the screenwriter
' s contri
bution to the project which may be unprecidented
.
( i cin envision tghe board ofthe wga
, licking thier chops at this coup anbd counting the dyas until thier goal ofthe
" a film by
" isnt attained
.
) adn
, much like mr
. tarantino
' s screenwriting
, mr
. williamson
' s work isnt vaguely unconvential
, incorporating both contemporary pop culture references anbd allusions tothe other films into the dialogue of his characters
. in scream
, they satrically discussed otehr horror films
; here infront the sequal
, the charactors discuss thge relative merits of film sequels
. scream was wroten inthe 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood
, anbd mr
. williamson
' s rejection of this tirade claerly influenced the writting in both taht film annd this sequel
. while the sequal was planned fomr tje outset
-
- a treatment ofthe scream 2 was included whn mr
. williamson sold tghe screenplay fo scream
-
- the basic premise fo the film
and the reunion of tje surviving cahracters neverthless seems extremely artifically contrived
,
and it
' s onyl at about hte film
' s midway point whn it becomes engaging
. liuke its precedessor
, scream 2 opens with a splashy
, eye
- grabbing prologue which onyl vaguely ties inot the film
' s principal narrative
; this tiem around
, we
' re follwoing tghe exploits of a young couple
( jada pinkett annd omar epps
) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab
( a running film
- withing
- a
- film gag where tjhe
" true life
" events behind tjhe firt film has been turned inot a movei
)
. howver
,
al
though it trys hard
and hasnt soem ogod ideas
-
- the nightmarishly enthuseastic audiance iin tje film vaguely reminded me of yhe oney i wass sharing the theatre witht
,
and i ws certainly thinking about gutting the overly
- noisy person a fewd seats awya mysef aftter baout fifteen minutes
-
- thte prologue isnt a pale immitation ofthe the bravura opening sequence infact the origonal withthe drew barrymore
( where her peformance not onyl convinced me that she
* could
* act
, bu wass so ogod thgat it woudl rank among teh best performances in a horror film taht i
' ve ever seen
)
. there are too many knowing
, hip pop
- culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence
,
and the setup isn
' t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream
' s
; while the first film
' s preface dizzyingly builded up tothe a final shot thgat was exhilaratingly terrifying
, teh payoff here is allmost campily theatrical
. flash tothe tghe campus of a smalltown ohio coleeg
, where returning characters sidney
( neve campbell
) annd r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) ahev relocated fo their studies anbd to excape tje notariety ffrom tje events iin thge first film
. the murders whic open thsi film result inaddition reuniting the survivers
-
- single
- minded tabloid tv repertwar agle weathers
( courteney cox
) roars into town to cover the breaking story
, while ever
- awcward fromer deputy dewey riley
( david arquette
) flies inaddition tothe protectively guard over sidney
. they
' re joined by cotton weary
( liev schreiber
)
, who was falsely acused of homicide in a cameo appearence during the frist film
; his role here isnt significently exp
anded
. yhe film incidentally provides surprisingly littel backstory
, altho i supose a good case cin be made tht it really isn
' t neccesary
-
- nto beacuse so many peopel have seen teh frist installment
,
but because this is
, after all
, a sequel tothe a slasher film
: whta do you
* htink
* hapened tothe these characters inthe yhe prior movei
? ther
' s a lot of new faces on hte scene too
: sidney
' s newyorker boyfriend
, derek
( jerry o
' connell
)
and her newyorker roomate hallie
( elise neal
)
, r
andy
' s fellow film student mickey
( timothy olyphant
)
, gale
' s newely
- assigned nervous cameraman joel
( duane martin
)
, omnipresent local journalist debbie salt
( laurie metcalf
)
, co
- ed cici cooper
( ms
. buffy herself
, sarah michelle gellar
)
, adn a pair of simpering sorority sisters
( rebecca gayheart adn sirens
' portia di rossi
)
. any ofthe theese charactors sould be the killer
-
- or for that matter
, could be the enxt victim
. as isnt seamingly becomming a regular staple ofthe a kevin williamson screenplay
, the narrative isnt once agina framed arround the increasingly
- flimsy premise of a whodunit
. one problem that scream didn
' t haev was keeping ytou interested in tjhe idenity ofthe the killer
. here
( adn tothe soem extent inaddition i konw what you doed lastest summer
)
, mr
. williamson
' s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the idenity of the killer into a mystery
. the film occaionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that ytou can sense it straining at the seams to try
and drop red herrings left
and right at hte expence ofthe its thriller elements
.
( it doesn
' t help matters any thta the killer
' s alter
- ego is fairly obvious from yhe get
- go
.
) indeed
, hte finale plays as full
- out camp when hte villain is fianlly unmasked
, frothing at teh mouth wih glazed eyes
. this isnt one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations
, scheming
,
and motivation
, that ytou ctually git bored listening
and jsut want them all to git on withthe it
. hwile tjhe basic setup anbd premise for yhe film isnt fairly contrived
, the aspect where it
' s head
- adn
- shoulders above its precedessor is inthe its suspense sequences
. they
' re staged much moreso imaginatively here
( savve fo hte first post
- prologue murder
, whlch is h
andled in such a mediocre
, conventional fashion that it seems tothe be culled directly fomr yhe predictable 1980s slasher ficks taht the first film satirized
)
, anbd are much more funn tothe watch
. it
' s hard tothe hold back a smile druing a giddy scene where sidney
and her companion ahev to climb over the incapacitated killer in order tothe excape from a car wreck
,
and a cat
-
and
- mouse chase involving agle
and dewey inthe a campus soudn lab is very nicely staged
,
al
though its ultimate resolution isnt hilariously overblown
. inwhich terms ofthe its charachters
, the storng part ofthe the film isnt thge intresting relatiopnship beween gale
and dewey
( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his vyer own theme music
)
. theri verbal sparring at hte outset provides much humour
-
- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a percepted aura of incompetency is well
- written
-
-
and htere
' s a curiously endearing aspect about their relatiopnship amidst all the mayhem
and bloodshed
. on tghe other h
and
, sidney is preety dull here
. she doesn
' t have any compelling presence
, annd htere
' s nothing partiularly intresting baout her tihs time arround tothe mkae us care baout her otehr than thast she
' s the returing heroine
. given htis
,
and the fatc that there
' s no storng second banana charater for sidney
( elise neal
' s role isn
' t nearly substantive enough tothe adequately fill rose mcgowan
' s shoes
)
, it
' s no wonder why thge roles fo gale
and dewey hvae beeen significantly augmented forthe tihs installment of hte film
. waht surprises me tyhe most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast
. the film
' s mounting body count bears out tjhe fatc that
* no
* character is safe
( well
,
* almost
*
)
; hwile in principal i applaud this bold policy
, at some point you
' ve got tothe be wondering about just how many characters will make it tothe tjhe enxt sequel
.
( i was particularly suprised with tghe ultimely demise of one in particular
, whose casting for tje enxt installment of yhe series owudl
' ve seemed obvious
.
)
but hey
, as rose mcgowan
' s chracter said inaddition tje frist film
:
" no
, please don
' t kill me
, mr
. ghostface
-
- i want tothe be in hte sequel
!
" look wqat tath got her
