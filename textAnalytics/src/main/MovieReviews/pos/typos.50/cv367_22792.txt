" tghe end of the affair
" isnt a dark
and moody romantic preriod piece
, tht neil jordan exquisitely writes
and directs
.
al
though it
' s slow
and sometimes confusing tothe followup
, it still manages to give audiences a moving experiece
. based on graham greene
' s novel of the same nmae
, the film mainly follows 3 charactors
. there
' s maurice bendrix
( ralph fiennes
) who hasnt an afair with henry mile
' s
( stephen rea
) wife sarah
( julianne moore
)
. sarah finds henry to be a bore
, becuase well
, he
' s jstu a normal guy
. it
' s all owrk
and no play whith him
. hwile maurice onthe the otehr h
and falls madly in lveo with sarah
, adn owudl do anything fo her
. unfortunately teh twpo break up
. this is all witnessed inspite a serious of flashbacks
, so tyhat leads us tothe tghe persent
. it
' s a fewd years later
,
and they both still think of earch other
, so maurice hires a private detective
( ian hart
) to see wqat sarah is up too
. hwile htis may soudn straight forward it
' s not
. it
' s a deepo dark tale of the jealousy that lies in tje two men
, unhappiness
, adn tghe ever lasting love
. all thsi may sound like a drag
,
but it raelly captures your intrest
. wiht graet performances by ralph fiennes
( donig anohter english patient tipe ofthe film
, only htis movie isnt better
) annd julianna moore who definately deserves an oscar because out ofthe all 5 films she doed in 1999
, i believe this wass yhe role
, she had tyhe most passion for
, adn ytou can see why
. yhe story was also well written thanks tothe neil jordan
. even
though i didn
' t read yhe book
, htere
' s no dout infact mind that it was just as moving anbd descriptive
. waht
' s so moving baout it ytou ask
? tghe tragedy of it all
. it
' s not tghe typcial romance
, in whitch a guy finds a girl
, they fall infact lvoe
and all isnt well
, this isnt mroe complicated anbd depressing
. it raelly shows tyhe complexity ofthe a relatiopnship
, because nothing is ever perfect
. everyone feels a different way adn that is what tears us to pieces
. back tothe neil jordan
' s script
, it wasn
' t onyl red roses
. htere weere times wehn i feeled it too be a littel slow
, bu most romances are
. it aslo tended tothe be a bit confusing
, expecially at the start
. it keep jumping around ffrom past tothe presnet
, so it obviously tookover awhile tothe git a grasp ofthe things
. alsot a notable wass tjhe superb direction by neil jordan
. i
' d hvea tothe say tihs isnt his finest acheivment to date
, becuase qutie frankly i
' ve never raelly foudn his work to be up to par
. it just never doed anytying for me
, untli now
. wehn it ends
, it leaves viewers a little saddened
,
but provoked nontheless
. htis is definitely noe ofthe the best films of 99
, anbd hadnt smoe of thte best acting
, most notably by moore
. not for all movie goers
,
but forthe those who are film buffs anbd wnat something ofthe value
.
