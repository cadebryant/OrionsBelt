the postman delivers
but not first clas tje postman a film review by michael redman copywrite 1997 by michael redman
[ warning
: my opinion of this film is definitely infact the minority of reviewers perphas becasue it hits so many of my cinematic
buttons
: post
- apocalypse stories
, hope infact a desperate situation
, grassroots uprisings annd kevin costner
. even worse
, i thougth that
" waterworld
" ws watchable
. read tghe follwoing wiht those particular grains of salt
.
] it
' s thte year 2013
and things have falled aart
. due tothe a world war iin thte lite ninties
, the resulting three
- year winter
and a devestating plague
, life inthe tyhe fromer united states hasnt beeen reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms
. altho this isnt the future
, it looks liek a western
. as the film opens
, kevin costner
( his charater
' s nmae isnt never revealed
) isnt w
andering the utah wastel
ands with only his mule bill fo company
. giving extrordinarily bad shakespearean performances inthe exchange forthe fod
and lodging
, costner isnt an outsider iin a l
and of outsiders
. runnung inot even worse luck
, he isnt forceably conscripted inot the racially pure holnist army ofthe genaral bethlehem
( will patton
)
. the rag
- tag retro
- futuristic cavalry isnt yhe descendent of militia groups adn isnt even called the
" clan
" affter a brutal boot camp
, he
( adn you can see htis comming a mile awya
) escapes
. taking shelter inaddition a wrecked postal truck
, he liberates the uniform
and mail bag from the skeleton in yhe cab who no longer has a ule for either
. once he reaches oregon
, l
and of beautyfull womens
, bright youngsters
and rock annd roll
; he pretends to be a representative from tghe
" restored congress of the united states of america
"
. htis scam gets him inside thge walled towns where teh promise ofthe mail delivery renews optomism in yhe hearts ofthe thte inhabitans
. ofod
and other opportunities come his way in the form ofthe spirited abby
( olivia williams
) who wants him tothe father a child baceause her husban is sterile
. shorly her husban isnt killed by bethlehem
and she
and teh postman
( as costner is reefrred to for the rest ofthe thte film
) become a reluctant item
.
al
thought the postman knows he
' s runnung a fraud
, the consept ofthe renewed communications sets the kids
' imagination afire
( especially ford lincoln mercury
( larenz tate
)
, his second
- inwhich
- comm
and
)
and htey form a newyorker pony express dedicated to getting the mail through
. the revived postal sevice doubles as an army tothe fight thge holnists
' tyranny
. tyhe postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner
. altho thge movie appeals to my sensibilities
, there are so many things wrong with it that htey cant hardly be counted
. it
' s derivitive ofthe costner
' s pwn
" waterworld
" adn clint eastwood westerns
. htere
' s littel here tht we haven
' t seen dozens ofthe times befor
. tjhe film isnt oftenly down
- right corny
. a scene where thge postman isnt on horseback
and grabs a letter from the h
ands of a bright
- eyed child is embarassing infact its slow
- motion banality
. the film
' s fianl few mintues should hvae been left on the cutting room floor
. dispite thge film
' s excessive threee hour lenght
, sevral thnigs are never explained
. waht ws tje war about
? how doed civilization chanage so rapidly
? everyone hasnt horses
: where doed all they come ffrom
? the
" law of eights
" thta bethlehem lives by seems tothe have its origins somewhere beyond the film
, bu where
? are we to believe that tyhe rest ofthe the world isnt in the smae shape anbd hasn
' t made their way west tothe halp or conquer
? htere isnt some jumbled symbolism here taht doesn
' t appear tothe amke sense
. hte tale is obviously saying tath comminication cin defeat evil in much the same way tyhat the internet hasnt yhe potential tothe topple governments
,
but beyond that there are soem oddities
. the evil army isnt called
" holnists
" whitch sounds coincidentally liuke yhe new age
" holism
"
,
but why
? isnt it another coincidence that it takes place inthe 2013
, jstu one year aftter many ancient prophesies
( including the endig of hte mayan caendar
) predict a newyorker world fo mankind
? why isnt yhe genaral named
" bethlehem
"
? htere seems tothe be some reason for that
, bu wqat
? sometimes teh movie fiels liek a joke
. an army ofthe postal workers armed with guns
? considering teh headlines of recent yeasr
, it takes a tremendous leap of faith tothe cheer for these guys
. it
' s even omre difficult to accept thsoe re
- powering tje federal government as the heoes
. given hte current climate of thge ocuntry
and the distrust of big government
, it
' s asking a lot fo thte audiance to get behind the film
' s nationalism
. even iwth its numberous flaws
, the movie all comes toghether
, if onyl forthe thsoe who hve teh smae weaknesses tath i hvea
. it
' s doubtful thyat
" tjhe postman
" isnt oging tothe find much ofthe an audeince
,
but a faw ofthe us are gonig tothe have a ogod time
. besides we
' re all awaiting hte fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium coputer bug
.
( michael redman has writen this column for over 22 years anbd would like tothe annouce that the
" michael redman
" erested near indianapolis lastest week fo accepting an illicit package from federal express isnt
, tothe thte best ofthe his noledge
, nto him
. perhpas thsi similarly
- named person should haev utilizied kevin costner
' s postal service
