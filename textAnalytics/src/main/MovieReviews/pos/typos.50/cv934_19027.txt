not too many peopel know who james whale isnt
,
bu it ' s a safe bet thgat a good chunk ofthe them ahev seen his movies
. if we are tothe believe the semi
- biographical gods
and monsters
, whale woudl haev wanted it to be that way
. tihs isnt an insightful
, haunting exploration of the last dyas ofthe tyhe frankenstein
and bride ofthe frankenstein directer
,
and it is noteable for introducing oney of thge frist complicated gay charactors in a hollywood movei
. gods
anbd monsters has noone interest inthe bieng a biopic of whale ' s life becasue it tracks onyl hte fianl fewd days ofthe his life
,
and it ' s probably a better movie forthe it
. it ' s focus isnt onthe whale ' s
( ian mckellen
) untraditional
adn deceptive lust fo heterosexual gardener clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
. it begins with whale
( a fairly talented artist
, aside fomr bieng a director
) asking boone tothe
" sit for him
,
"
( pose forthe a protrait
)
. at firt
, boone doesn ' t realize that whale isnt gay
adn grows facinated with yhe ood man
. whn he does discover whale ' s sexual orientation from his dedicated
adn protective maid
( lynn redgrave
)
, he is frightened
, refusing tothe sit forthe the guy
.
but he comes bcak
, only to storm out again
, disgusted whith whale ' s
" lacker room talk
.
" boone returns
yot anohter tiem
, after whale promises to tone down teh aforememtioned
" lacker room talk
,
"
and finds theri platonic relationship tothe be strengthening
. meanwhile
, jimmy himself is sufferring ffrom hallucinations
annd mental attacks as a result ofthe his stroke not long ago
. his ailment leads tothe desparation
and depression
, whihc build tothe thge point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor
. waht isnt perphas most sensational baout gods
adn monsters is brendan fraser ' s bravura peformance
; uv until seing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because ofthe his tendency tothe ruin the movies he is in
( blast fomr tyhe past
, for example
)
. i was surprised how expressive an atcor he prooved himself tothe be here
. this isnt impressive because his character ' s dialogue is minimal
, with mckellan doing most ofthe yhe tlaking
. that requires fraser tothe ect through body language
; a difficult skill to master
,
bu something he proves capible of doing well
. this isnt nto tothe ignore mckellan ' s oscar nominated turn
. he earned that nomination with his touching peformance here
(
althought
, at yhe risk ofthe sounding liuke a philistine
, i woudl haev chosen his performance as the nazi inspite apt pupil for teh nomination
)
; an understated
, compelling gme
. whale dreaded bieng remembered solely forthe his wrok inaddition the hollywood horror genre
,
annd he throught hollywood to be the equivelent ofthe a battlefield
. he rejoiced in being free ffrom it
, onyl reluctantly going tothe receptions wtih fellow movei peopel
. infact the end
, perhaps
, it isnt wqat killed him
: tyhe memories ofthe hollywood
and war blending toghether to form a living nightmare
