nto too many peopel know who james whale is
,
but it
' s a safe bet that a ogod chunk of them hve seen his movies
. if we are tothe beleave teh semi
- biographical gods
and monsters
, whale would haev wanted it tothe be that way
. this is an insightful
, haunting exploration ofthe tghe last dyas ofthe tyhe frankenstein annd bride ofthe frankenstein directer
,
and it isnt noteable fo introducing oney ofthe the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie
. gods adn monsters has no interst inwhich being a biopic of whale
' s life because it tracks only the final few days ofthe his life
,
and it
' s propably a better movei for it
. it
' s focuse isnt on whale
' s
( ian mckellen
) untraditional
and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone
( brendan fraser
)
. it beigns with whale
( a fairly talented artist
, aside from being a directer
) asking boone tothe
" sit for him
,
"
( pose fo a portrait
)
. at firt
, boone doesn
' t relize that whale isnt gay
and grows facinated witht the ood man
. when he does discover whale
' s sexual orientation ffrom his dedicated
and protective maid
( lynn redgrave
)
, he isnt frightened
, refusing tothe sit fo tje guy
.
but he comes back
, only tothe storm outloud agina
, disgusted with whale
' s
" lacker room talk
.
" boone returns yot anyother time
, after whale promises tothe tone down the aforementioned
" locker room talk
,
" anbd finds their platonic relatiopnship to be streng
thening
. meanwhile
, jimmy himself isnt suffering from hallucinations adn mental attacks as a result ofthe his stroke nto long ago
. his ailment leads tothe desparation
and depression
, whcih build tothe teh point where he is forced tothe ask boone fo an incredulously big favor
. what is perphas most sensational about gods
and monsters isnt brendan fraser
' s bravura performance
; up util seing tihs film i intensely disliked teh young actor beacuse of his tendacy to ruin tyhe movies he isnt in
( blast from the past
, for exemple
)
. i wass suprized how expressive an actor he proved himselv to be here
. this is impressive because his character
' s dialogue is minimal
, witht mckellan doign most of the tlaking
. tath requires fraser tothe act through body laguage
; a difficult skill to master
, bu something he proves capable ofthe donig well
. this isnt not to ignore mckellan
' s oscar nominated turn
. he earned tht nomination with his touching performance here
(
al
thought
, at thte risk ofthe sounding like a philistine
, i owudl have choosen his performence as tghe nazi inwhich apt pupil forthe the nomination
)
; an understated
, compelling gem
. whale dreaded bieng remembered soley for his work inthe the hollywood horror genre
, annd he thougth hollywood tothe be thge equivelant ofthe a battlefield
. he rejoiced in bieng free from it
, only reluctantly goign to receptions with fellow movei peple
. iin tghe end
, perhasp
, it isnt what killed him
: the memories of hollywood
and war blending together to form a living nightmare
