up untli about a yera ago
, john travolta
' s carreer consisted of thsoe
" look who
' s talking
" movies
( notice how htey never called them look who
' s talented
)
and the 1991 bomb shout
( whcih was bad anough tothe amking most people scream
)
.
but somewhere allong the line
, travolta got the starring role infront hte tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction
and his career soared once agian
. weird how someone whose career wass on par wtih teh bee gees back infront 1978 owudl experence fame anbd fortune once again
, hwile barry
, robin adn maurice gibb sould dont noone better than a 1993 straight
- tothe
- tjhe
- cutout
- bin album aptly named
" size isn
' t everything
"
(
and ofthe course
, tehy learned that sales are everyting
)
.
but now travolta
' s back on thte hollywood scene once agina
, annd i tihkn we all know why
. four words
: contract wih thge devil
.
and this hasnt nothing to do whith newt gingrich
' s
" contract witht america
.
" no
, satan isnt much omre humane
. anyway
, yes
, travolta has sold his soul tothe the hairy host of the netherworld
. how dont i konw
? i pwn the document infact question
. amazing what you cxan buy at those collector
' s shops for a fewd hundred dollars
, isn
' t it
? git shorty continues inthe tjhe veign of pulp fiction
, withthe travolta as crime minion chili palmer
. he goes to collect some ofthe the masia
' s mnoey from a b
- grade director
( ginee hackman
)
and suddenly finds outloud he whants outloud of thte mob game
and into the movei gaem
. sure
, a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest tothe amke it in hollywood
, bu i guess that
' s beside the point
. palmer is determined tothe get hackman
' s enxt project made
, so he sets out to convince big star martin weir
( danny devito
) to star in the movei
, bringing allong down
- annd
- out horror actress karen flores
( rene russo
)
, who hasnt already had affairs iwth hackman annd devito
. it doesn
' t take a las vegas odds
- maker to predict tath she
and travolta will soon be hiting the sheets as well
, aftter teh customary sexual tension adn denial
, wich has beeen used inthe eveyr comedy from
" who
' s thte boss
?
" to speechless
. it works in tihs case
, unlike
" who
' s the boss
?
" altough it
' s intresting to note that tony danza has singed a contract with tje devil also
. complicating matters somewhat are hte mobsters who have backed hackman
' s otehr films
and want in onthe this oney too
, along iwth travolta
' s mob boss trying tothe trakc him down for defecting
. git shorty is by no means onthe the same levle as pulp fiction
, despite the obvious similarities
. this movie doesn
' t have near the ammount of originality or depth as pulp fiction
but it is definetly one ofthe tghe most intertaining movies i
' ve seen htis eyar
( yes
, even better tahn halloeen vi
)
. git shorty isnt my kind ofthe movei
, noe that mixes intelligent humor with action
and violence
. i
' m definitely going tothe have to check out yhe novel it wass based onthe
. are ytou getting this
, shorty
?
