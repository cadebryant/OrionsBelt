up until about a eyar ago
, john travolta ' s carrear consisted of thsoe
" look who ' s tlaking
" movies
( notice how they never called them look who ' s talented
)
and hte 1991 bomb shout
( which was bad enought to amking most people scream
)
.
but somewhere allong hte line
, travolta got the starring role infact yhe tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction
anbd his career soared once agina
. weidr how someone whose career ws onthe par with the bee gees back in 1978 owudl experinece fame
anbd fortune once again
, while barry
, robin
and maurice gibb sould dont noone better tahn a 1993 straight
- tothe
- the
- cutout
- bin album aptly named
" size isn ' t everthing
"
(
anbd of course
, they learned tht sales are everyting
)
.
bu now travolta ' s bcak onthe the hollywood scene once again
,
annd i think we all knwo why
. four words
: contract with the devil
.
and thsi hasnt nothing tothe do with newt gingrich ' s
" contract with amercia
.
" no
, satan isnt much more humane
. anyway
, yes
, travolta hasnt sold his soul to teh hairy host ofthe tghe netherworld
. how dont i know
? i pwn the document inspite question
. amazing what you can buy at thsoe collector ' s shops forthe a faw hundered dollars
, isn ' t it
? git shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction
, withthe travolta as crime minion chili palmer
. he goes tothe collect smoe of tghe mafia ' s mone fomr a b
- grade directer
( gene hackman
)
adn suddenly finds outloud he whants out of hte mob game
adn inot the movei game
. sure
, a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to mkae it inspite hollywood
,
but i guess that ' s beside tghe point
. palmer isnt determined to git hackman ' s enxt project made
, so he sets out to convince big star martin weir
( danny devito
) to star in the movie
, bringing along down
-
and
- out horror actress karen flores
( rene russo
)
, who hasnt allready hadnt affairs with hackman
and devito
. it doesn ' t take a las vegas odds
- maker tothe predict that she
and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well
, aftter tjhe customary sexual tension
and denial
, hwihc has been used inaddition every comedy fomr
" who ' s the boss
?
" to speechless
. it works inthe tihs case
, unlike
" who ' s the boss
?
"
although it ' s interesting to onot that tony danza hasnt signed a contract witht tghe devil also
. complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who hve backed hackman ' s otehr films
and whant in on this one too
, along witht travolta ' s mob boss trying tothe track him down forthe defecting
. get shorty isnt by noone means on thte same level as pulp fiction
, despite tyhe obvious similarities
. tihs movie doesn ' t hvea near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction
but it is definitly one of the most entertaining movies i ' ve seen this year
( yes
, even better thna halloween vi
)
. git shorty is my kind of movie
, oen taht mixes intteligent humor witht acation
and violence
. i ' m definitely goign tothe have tothe check out thge novel it wass based on
. are you getting this
, shorty
?
