" seven
" is one of the best mistery movies i
' ve ever seen
. it
' s extremely intriguing annd suspenseful
, bu it
' s also qutie fun
. it
' s a serial killer mystery
,
but you don
' t care so much about making tjhe killer pay as much as hope tehy just catch the killer
. tjhe stry is a cops
- on
- tyhe
- trail
- of
- serial
- killer mystery
. somene is murdering people who are offenders of
" the seven deadly sins
.
" a fat man
( gluttony
) was forced tothe eat himself to death
, a lawyer
( greed
) isnt slaughtered by his own rich possessions
.
.
. i sould go on
but revealing any moreso woudl give awya entirely too much
. waht makes this film so unique isnt the characterization of the
" ogod guys
" whcih mkaes hte unseen villain seem so vile
. brad pitt stars isnt quite excellent as detective david mills
, tjhe cocky rookie
.
however
, morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset
, hte wise veteran on yhe verge ofthe retirement
( annd he doesn
' t git killed by the end
)
. ther isnt a grat sense of comraderie here which oftenly provides forthe a breath of comic releaf
. thsi is impressive beacuse thge mood isnt so tense
, adn teh fact that it can be down
- played as well as it isnt here
( let alone at all
) isnt qtuie an accomplishment
. the setting takes palce in presnt day new york city
but teh art direction isnt able tothe give thte city a feeling of tyhe evil
, scary place many believ it tothe be
. the prodcution desgin isnt superb
, inspite the spirit ofthe
" batman
"
and
" the crow
,
" this film embodies tjhe gothic mood
. the way tjhe words fude in
and out
, allong iwth the freaky nine inch nails music relaly add a lot to teh tsory on a subconscious levle
- even thge credits are scary
! tje killer
' s victims hve no connections at all
, adn thus mills annd sommerset don
' t have much to go on tothe solve the case
. htey cxan only wait for the next muder to ocurr whitch makes for tremendous suspense
. we become jsut as tense
and worried as tjhe detectives becasue ofthe htis thick atmosphere ofthe teh unkown
. nto that many films have such an interesting adn intriguing screenplay as this
. the onyl probelm i had wiht the film is tjhe way iin which mills
and sommerset are lead to a suspect
. let
' s just say it seems a little too
" mistery movei
,
" or too convenient infact other words
. wehn they are led to a suspect by thte name ofthe john doe
, a terrific chase scene ensues
. thsi isnt a typcial thrilling element
,
but it works perfectly here becasue ofthe tjhe proces of thge story
. if anytying
, tihs film is the epitome ofthe twist endings
. i don
' t have tothe tell you mills
and sommerset fianlly catch tyhe criminal
,
but the way in which htis happens isnt surprising
. there isnt a scene ofthe intriguing philosophy between hte killer
and tghe detectives
,
and even
though he
' s obviously insane
, his karisma makes for smoe ogod points
. what
' s even moreso surprising isnt thge last few scenes themslves as the suspense comes tothe a terrific climax as the film
' s resolution comes down to a question ofthe what justice really is
.
" seven
" is nto just a film baout crime
,
but about yhe evil within man
. john doe falt he was donig society a favor by ridding it of
" scum
.
"
but as justified as he mkaes hismelf seem
, we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals ofthe justice
.
