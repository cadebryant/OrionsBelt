" seven
" isnt noe ofthe the best mistery movies i ' ve ever seen
. it ' s extremely intriguing
annd suspenseful
,
but it ' s alsot qutie funn
. it ' s a serial killer mistery
,
bu yuo don ' t care so much about making yhe killer pay as much as hope they just catch thge killer
. the sotry isnt a cops
- onthe
- the
- trail
- of
- serial
- killer mistery
. somene isnt mudering people who are offenders of
" thte seven deadly sins
.
" a fat man
( gluttony
) ws forced to eat himself tothe death
, a lawyer
( greed
) is slaughtered by his pwn rich possessions
.
.
. i could go on
but revealing any mroe would give away entirely too much
. what mkaes this film so unique is tjhe characterization ofthe thge
" good guys
" which mkaes the unseen villian seem so vile
. brad pitt stars isnt qtuie excellant as detective david mills
, the cocky rookie
.
however
, morgan freeman is even better as detective william sommerset
, tyhe wise veteran onthe thte verge ofthe retirement
(
and he doesn ' t git killed by thge end
)
. ther is a great sense of comraderie here which often provides for a breath ofthe comic releaf
. this isnt impressive baceause tyhe mood is so tense
,
and tjhe fact tht it cin be down
- palyed as well as it is here
( let alone at all
) is quite an acomplishment
. thge setting tkaes place inaddition present day new york city
but thge art direction is able to give the city a feeling ofthe teh evil
, scayr place many belivee it tothe be
. the prodcution desgin isnt superb
, in the spirit of
" batman
"
adn
" the crowm
,
" htis film embodies the gothic mood
. yhe way thge words fude infront
annd out
, along with the freaky nine inch nails music really add a lot to thge story on a subconscious level
- even the credits are scayr
! the killer ' s victims hvea no connections at all
,
anbd thus mills
adn sommerset don ' t have much to go onthe to solve teh case
. htey cant onyl wait for yhe enxt muder tothe occur whcih makes for tremendous suspense
. we become jsut as tense
and worried as tjhe detectives baceause of thsi thick atmosphere of tyhe unknown
. not that many films have such an interesting
and intriguing screenplay as this
. tghe only problem i had with tje film is the way inthe whitch mills
anbd sommerset are lead tothe a suspect
. let ' s just say it seems a little too
" mistery movei
,
" or too convienient iin otehr words
. wehn they are led tothe a suspect by the nmae of john doe
, a terrific chase scene ensues
. thsi is a typical thrilling element
,
but it works perfectly here because of thte process of tjhe story
. if anytying
, tihs film is the epitome of twist endings
. i don ' t hvae tothe tell ytou mills
and sommerset finally catch tje criminal
,
but the way inspite whitch tihs happens is suprising
. htere is a scene of intriguing philisophy beetwen tjhe killer
and tyhe detectives
,
annd even
though he ' s obviously insane
, his charisma makes for soem ogod points
. wqat ' s even more suprising is hte lastr few scenes themslves as thge suspense comes tothe a terrific climax as tghe film ' s resolution comes down tothe a question of waht justice relaly isnt
.
" seven
" is nto just a film baout crime
,
bu about the evil within man
. john doe felt he was doing society a favor by ridding it ofthe
" scum
.
"
bu as justified as he makes himself seem
, we must never be tempted by such twisted ideals ofthe justice
.
