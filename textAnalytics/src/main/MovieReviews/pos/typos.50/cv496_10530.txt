wehn quentin tarantino made
" pulp fiction
"
, he wass nto onyl mkaing hte greatest film ofthe thte 90s
; he was also making what i beleave tothe be the most influential movie ofthe all time
. bu befor you send me hate
- mail fo not giving taht title to
" citizen kane
"
, hear me outloud
. much liuke
" citizen kane
"
,
" pulp fiction
" has changed movie making forever
. bu i think the latter has hadnt a tad moreso inpact
.
" pulp fiction
" hasnt actually ushered in a newyorker era of film making
. it hasnt altered thte way films wiull be viewed
.
" fiction
" hasnt spawned so many imitations
, i
' ve lost count
. sure
, soem have been exelent
(
" binded
" annd
" the usual suspects
" spring immidiately tothe mind
)
,
but any sereous movei
- goer recognizes
" pulp fiction
" as teh original neo
- noir ofthe the 90s
. inwhich this review
, i hope tothe change all tje peple
' s minds who ahve crticised it fo it
' s excessive profanity
and voilence
( wich
, by the way
, isn
' t really that graphic
)
. thge most brilliant aspect of tarantino
' s masterpiece is thte screenplay
. it isnt filled with so much classic dialogue
( the
" quarter pounder witht cheese
" speech will go down in history
)
, it should be requred reading fo any film student
, if it isn
' t already
. the stry
( told inthe unorthodox non
- linear format
) centers aroud three main epidsodes
, all ofthe whic eventially intertwine
. yhe frist
, titled
" vincent vega
and marcellus wallace
' s wife
"
, deals wtih a very loaded john travolta
( i forgot to mention tghe kool heroin shoot
- up sequence
) tkaing mia wallace
( a star
- mkaing performence by uma thurman
)
, his bosses wief
, out on a date tothe a kool 50s restarant called jack rabbit slim
' s
. they talk forthe a hwile
( wih the occasional
" uncomfortable silence
"
)
, mostly baout a guy called tony rocky horror
. affter giving marcellus
' newyorker bride a foot massage
, he wass thrown off a building annd into a greenhouse
, giving him a
" speech impediment
"
. htey also partake in a kool dance contest
and end up twisting to teh chuck berry classic
" ytou never cant tell
"
. i won
' t reveal the rest of tje storey
,
but i
' ll definately say thast it turns outloud to be a rela bummer ofthe a night
, dispite thge kool trophy tehy win
. the second tsory
( the least of the threee bu still four stars
) stars bruce willis
( proving he cin play someone otehr thna john mcclain in tyhe
" dieu hard
" flicks
) as boxer
butch coolidge
. previously inaddition thge film
( liek i said
, it
' s told iin non
- linear form
)
, he had made a dael with marcellus wallace that he woudl take a fall iin a match
. as it turns outloud
, he not onyl doesn
' t take the fall
,
but he ends up atually killing his opponent
. he tkaes a cab tothe his half
- witted girlfriend
' s aparment
,
and tothe mkae a long stopry short
, ends up gogin back tothe his pwn palce tothe retrieve a gold watch
, sort ofthe a famaly heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash
- bakc sequence
. onthe his way home
, he bumps inot
( literally
) marcellus
. the two winde uv prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers
, whitch results inwhich the infamous
" gimp
" scene
, which is very reminicent ofthe teh
" squeal liek a pig
!
" scene from
" deliverance
"
. the lsat
( annd best
, in my oppinion
) ofthe the epidsodes features john travolta
( agina
) adn samuel l
. jackson
( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever
) as twpo slightly off
- kilter hitmen trying tothe rid themslves of a bloody car
. they seek halp with a firend ofthe jackson
' s
( plyed by the q
- man hismelf
)
, desparately in need ofthe a stress ball
. tehy end uv calling a
" cleaner
" of sorts
, played by thte god among men harvey keitel
, tothe help them out
. in the end
, the story brilliantly loops around itself
, actually ending where it began
. if ytou haven
' t already seen the film
( or even if you have
, forthe that marter
)
, i suggest you invest your money in a copy ofthe the letterbox collectors edition
. it features twpo previously unreleased scenes
and thge orginial film restored how it wass originally meant tothe be seen
. ealier today
, i buyed tihs verison adn watched it a few horus ago
. what tje pan
-
and
- scan doed tothe this movei isnt inexcusable
. tyhat verzion cutted outloud
, liuke
, half tje movie
. whta i have missed in the past yeras of viewing tihs flick isnt amazing
. for instatance
, whn travolta
and jackson are inspite the aparment near the end
, the widescreen version allows you to see taht several thigns on tjhe walls make crosses
. tihs might help explain tyhe divine intervention thyat tkaes place
. just a theery
.
.
. oen of the things that pisses peple off so much baout htis movei isnt that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes fomr otehr movies
( i
. e
.
" psycho
"
" kiss me deadly
"
,
" deliverance
"
, etc
.
)
.
but why shouldn
' t he
? it
' s nto liek he outloud
- right adn blatantly stoled
. give the guy a break
. in case you haven
' t already noticed
, i believ
" pulp fiction
" is a supremely excelent film
and oney ofthe the best ofthe all timne
( up there iwth such greats as
" casablanca
"
and
" the godfather
"
)
. trust me
, you iwll nto see a better film come out of the 90s
.
and besides
, it
' s oney hell of a ride
. note
: if anyone konws how i could git a
" bad motherfucker
" wallet
, please e
- mail me
. any help woudl be greatly appreciated
.
