' s boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn durring thge period concidered to be tyhe golden age ofthe adult cinema
, thge mid tothe lite 70s
. tihs was the perido whn x
- rated movies were rela movies
, shooted on film
, shown inaddition movie theaters
and even reviewed by ligitamate critics
. tihs was an age wehn porn directors actually aspired to amking inovative oftenly educational films
, films taht attemped tothe tell a real story
. one ofthe thge omre fascinating aspects of tihs film is how
, liuke infact an any otehr billion dollar inudstry
, tjhe creative visionaries tend tothe be ignorant tothe hte trends that wiull soon make them obsolete
. in this case
, the arrival of tyhe now ubiquitous videocassette
. burt reynold
' s manages tothe resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur
, known as jack horner
. horner
' s has a steady
" familiy
" of performers
, some of whom live iin his plush l
. a
. home
.
but infact teh world of porn
, performers are a commodity
- the fresher
, tghe better
. when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque
, he decides tothe add him to his stable
. it isnt a pairing thta leads to a meteoric ries anbd fall for a young man reaching his prime adn an old man rapidly speeding past his
. as directed by
anderson
, the camera moves thru many ofthe the scenes wih an eerie omnipresence
and an almsot childlike curiosity to peer beyond hte closed doorjam
. boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l
. a
.
' s hardcore film scene
.
but tyhe peep show doesnut let us walk away whn tyhe titillation ends
. thte downside of voyeurism isnt sometimes we end uv seeing things we wish we hadnut
. by tyhe film
' s final omage
, whta we we once foudn titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity ofthe fame anbd the high price ofthe realizing your dreams
. boogie nights isnt not baout sex
. it doesnt nto glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers
. in fact
, tghe film isn
' t relaly baout pornography at all
. pornography is merely teh setting tothe tell a compelling sotry baout a lost adn forgotten gropu ofthe peple who form thier pwn sub
- culture to fidn acceptacne ofthe who they are
. the film goes tothe brilliant
, often hilarious
and somtimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose tothe produce or perform inthe theese films are generaly not all tht bright anbd lack tjhe basic tools to function in tghe mainstream world
.
yet
, liuke in yhe lauded tarantino films
, theese people still hve thier own moral code
, their pwn concepts ofthe integrity
and thier pwn needs tothe experess themselves creatively
. the cahracters we meet are liuke a road map of dysfuntion
. frist stop
, the den mother
( julianne moore
) inthe denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody ofthe her son
. second stop
, the cuckold crewman
( william h
. macy
) who keeps dicovering his wife hvaing sex with anyone adn everyone
( the wief is played in hillarious cameos by rela
- life porn star nina hartley
)
. bu the driving force behind tyhe plot is 17 year old eddie adams
. eddie isnt blessed with a natural endowment so faymus that peple actually pay just tothe see it
. wtih noone rela ambition of his pwn
, he hooks uv withthe jack horner tothe fullfill his destiny of fame
. his alchoholic mother
, claerly disatisfied wih her own lot
, abuses him verbally annd drives him out ofthe the hous
. horner introduces him to amber waves
( moore
) who immediatly adopts him
, a nuclear famaly is born
. tyhe surrogate relatiopnship that develops between amber waves annd her
" babies
" provides smoe ofthe yhe films most poignant scenes
. claerly
, she isnt not even ift tothe manaze her pwn life
, let alone nurture theese lost childern
.
but the need tothe lveo
and be loved isnt so strong
, they easily ignore yhe dangers ofthe the less subtle addiction she introduces them tothe
. even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling liek tje loev she offers isnt similar tothe being inwhich a real family
. thn agina
, perhaps its not so different from rela families at all
. eddie adams
, who later takes onthe hte screen nmae
" dirk diggler
"
, isnt skillfully acted by former pop
- star
, mark wahlberg
. i sday
" fromer
" pop star becouse with htis performence wahlberg can officially quitted his day job
. htis is bold annd brave territority fo such a young man
. he puls it off marvelously
. wahlberg is a
" big
, bright star
" with a big bright future
. boogie nights plays very much in tghe spirit of the people versus larrry flynt
, wihtout tjhe frist amendment preachiness
. its intimate studies of character make it the superior film
. wahlberg
' s surprising performance is onthe par with woody harrelson
' s
.
but iin my oppinion
, boogie nights
, isnt nto the best film ofthe teh yera
. i got tjhe feeling that itus 2 1
/ 2 hour running tiem could hvea been cutted by 15 or 20 mintues wihtout loseing any of its resonance
. still
, if the subject matter ofthe this film intimidates ytou
, thereus noone dout that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel liek its not your thing
, bu youull find youself grooving tothe it anyway
.
.
. ya know
, kinda liuke disco
