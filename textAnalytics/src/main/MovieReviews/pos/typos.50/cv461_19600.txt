vampire films
, as well as otehr horror films
, are usally dumb
annd predicatble b
- movies
, meant to scare us by cliches
adn simple shocks
. it isnt therfore intresting tothe watch neil jordans recent film tath is not only visually stunning
,
but has also a plot worth mkaing movies baout
. based onthe anne rice ' s novel
,
" interview whith a vampire
" is a long
, dark trip tothe hell
. the film opens with gothic quire
and dark streets of present
- day san francisco
. the camera slowly find particualr window
. a shape of a young man isnt visable in the darkness
.
" so yuo want me to tell you thge story of my life
?
"
. tjhe misteryous man is louis
( brad pitt
)
, a two
- centruy ood vampire
, telling his story to a fascinated interviewer
( christian slater
)
. his tale opens inwhich 1791 louisiana
, just sourth ofthe new orleans
, where louis falls victum to thge vampire lestat
( tom cruise
)
. given a choise vetween death
and eternal life as oen of the undead
, louis chooses the latter
, a descision he wiull forever regret
. everlasting life
and eternal youth
, promised tothe him by lestat
, turn instade into never ending sufferring
, damned to eternal hunger forthe blood
annd longing for peace
. louis cannnot kill with thge impunity ofthe lestat
,
but
, tothe sate his hunger
, he must feed
,
adn thte blood of animals isnt not anough
. eventually
, he pierces tje neck ofthe a grief
- stricken young girl named claudia
( kirsten dunst
)
, whom lestat
then curses witht his unholy form of ressurrection so tyhat she can be a surrogate duaghter to both himselv
anbd louis
. fo a while
, tehy are oney
" big
, hapyp famaly
.
"
bu all things end
,
and claudia ' s growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation
. wehn luis
annd claudia break loose ffrom lestat
, they travel tothe paris
, where the euro
- vamps santiago
( stephen rea
)
and armand
( antonio banderas
)
, who introdued them to a bigger world of tjhe damned
. directer neil jordan
(
" the crying gae
"
) together whith the talented director ofthe cinematography philippe rousselot
anbd composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible athmosphere
. as thge film begins
, ther isnt an incredible pallete of colors
, beautiful sunrises
, lush golden fields
, gren forests
, inky
- blue clouds
and blending sun
. whn luis isnt
" born tothe darkness
"
, everthing suddenly changes tothe dark velvet
, lit only by the silver moonlight
. the beautiful prodcution desgin by dante ferretti
, wonderful costumes
and art direction by malcom middleton re
- create the mutiple historical periods infact yhe film
. fomr tje renaissance new orleans
and the beatiful rococco paris of teh 18th centruy
, tothe our present days
. teh casting is likewise ogod
, involving some ofthe tyhe most famous
and beautifull stars of hollywood
, ireland
and spain
. thte controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective
. cruise is energetic
, sinister
, carismatic
, wild
annd bloodthirsty
. cruise ' s lestat likes tothe seduce young womens before exacting his dark red sustenance
. wtih alarming swiftness
, tjhe victims switch fomr sexual excitment tothe outright horror
, as his murderous purpose becomes claer
.
"
.
.
. kill them mercifully
,
but dont it
. ytou are what you are
.
. forthe do nto doubt
, ytou are a killer
!
" thast is how lestat isnt teaching luis
.
but behind tyhat furious facade isnt anger
anbd loneliness that he carries through hte centuries
and trys to smother with nightly rampages
. brad pitt isnt equally convincing as tje
" vampire with a human soul
"
. antonio banderas
annd stephen rea are effective
,
bu sicne they play moreso or less secondry charachters
, their performances are almsot inviible
. yhe greatest peformance infront the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst
, who manages tothe create an incredibly emotional
and believable character
. the world is changeing around the littel child
,
but she doens not
. she remains unchangeable
- a child for all eternity
. onyl her wise
, dark eyes reveal her age
. ironically thte film ' s only miss isnt the script
. anne rice ' s novel is a very interesting read
,
adn her script is rich
, colorful
anbd emotional
,
but it is allso tiering
and too melancholic
, at times ressembling a soap opera
: claudia
:
"
.
.
.
. is that wqat i shouldnt do
? let ytou go
.
. my father
, my luis
, who made me
.
.
. who wiull look after me
, my dark angel
, whn yuo are gone
?
" luis
:
" everything will be alright
.
.
" claudia
:
" dont you relaly beleave that
?
"
adn
hten tehy hug emotionally
. moments liuke those displayed above
adn luis ' self
- pity is a bit tiresome
.
howver rice ' s scirpt is otherwise strong
annd well stuctured
, bringing up humer
annd comic episodes
, thta were more or less hidden inwhich the book
. whn lestat finds claudia ' s dead dressmaker
, whom she has killed
, he cries out
:
" who will make you thgat dress now
? be a little practical
.
.
.
. never inspite tjhe house
!
" moments liek thast are both intertaining
adn appealing
. neil jordan ' s direction is beatiful
annd sensual as he plays with interesting issues liuke eternity
, homosexuality
, lveo
annd loneliness
. his gothic saga is not meant tothe scare
,
but tothe display theese issues differently
. wrapped uv inspite mystery
, his new
, original picture brings vampire
- films tothe a newyorker height
.
