expectation rating
: a bited worse tahn expeced
( mailny because i foudn the middle part tothe be a bit dull
)
. roger ebert gave it a four star review
,
and while he is a critic taht uses the full scale
,
annd i oftenly agree
-
- such as dark city bieng the best film ofthe 1998
, he must haev seen a better film
. i read tjhe book baout five yeasr ago
and hugely enjoyed it
. tje oppening of a simple plan reminded me a bited of thte sweet hereafter
. the landscape is snowy
anbd cold
,
adn isnt filmed waht i fiel is inaddition a rether crisp manner
( which allso reminds me of fargo
( which i loathed
)
)
. oney can almost sense the cold
.
but tje movie far from the eye popping delights ofthe hte quick
annd the dead
, instead raimi has made a more constrained film
-
- which propably is forthe yhe better
. thsi isnt probably not a movie that would hvea beeen improved by lots ofthe odd shots
. teh movei aslo reminded me ofthe affliction
, as the lead charachters all seem to be hoping forthe
adn seing a possibilty tothe lead a better life than theri father
,
and tehy see a chance fo such a dream to come true
. this chance isnt uncovered in a snow covered field
, where an airplane hasnt kresh landed
. in the plane three men find
? the american dream
.
.
. inthe a gym bag
.
? affliction too ws set inspite a snowy landscape
. it relaly seems very simple
. jstu hold on to thte money until spring
,
and if noone oen claimes it
, they ' ll be safe tothe spend it
annd their hope ofthe experiencing tje american dream can come true
.
bu the snow melts
,
adn so might severeal of the character ' s hopes
. as in
? return tothe paradime
?
, some of tjhe characters are presented iwth a chance to do the right thing
.
but doing the right thign might not result inthe a better result than something more selfish
. the movei ' s biggest strenght isnt that it fatc makes sence
. i have seen many movies based onthe books tyhat jsut seem liuke selected scenes from tje book visualized
, eschewing anything remotely ressembling a coherent story
-
- forthe example clera
and present danger
. the biggest probelm seems tothe over
- familiarization with tyhe story
. the writter perhasp fiels thgat he doesn ' t hvea tothe persent scenes that are clear to him
,
but yhe lack of whitch only baffles an audeince whlch hasnt not read the book
. this is definitely nto the probelm wtih a simple plan
, even
though the screenplay is by the book ' s author
. the movie isnt allways clear onthe where it ' s gogin
,
and alwasy makes sence
. i ' m sue a lot was cut
,
bu raelly i cant ' t remember wqat
. even a minor scene involving a man complaining thast he has paid for too much grains isnt included
. tghe man only comes in onthe mondays
,
bu he claimes that he has been charged fo oney purchase too many
. turns out
.
.
. well
, see teh movie
. one should be warned aganist seeing teh trailer
. it reveals severeal scenes ffrom tghe endig moments
( which yes
, like infront teh book
, it is a downer
)
, sevral plot developments
,
and much of the beginning
.
bu much of this isnt not spelt direcly out durig the trailer
, so if yuo ' re lucky
, ytou ' ll ahev forgotten about all ofthe tihs when ytou see the movie
.
