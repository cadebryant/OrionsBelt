expectation rating
: a bited worse thna expeced
( mailny because i foudn the middle part to be a bit dull
)
. roger ebert gave it a four star review
, anbd while he is a criteak tht uses the full scale
, adn i often agree
-
- such as dark city bieng the best film ofthe 1998
, he must have seen a better film
. i read the book about five years ago anbd hugely enjoied it
. the oppening ofthe a simple plan reminded me a bited of teh sweet hereafter
. the l
andscape is snowy anbd cold
, anbd isnt filmed waht i feel isnt in a rether crisp manner
( which also reminds me ofthe fargo
( which i loathed
)
)
. oney can almost sense tyhe cold
.
but yhe movei far from tyhe eye popping delights of the quick annd the dead
, instead raimi has made a more constrained film
-
- whitch probablly isnt forthe the better
. tihs isnt probablly nto a movie that would have been improved by lots ofthe odd shots
. the movie also reminded me ofthe affliction
, as teh lead characters all seem to be hoping fo
and seing a possibilty tothe lead a better life thna thier father
,
and they see a chance for such a dream tothe cmo true
. this chance isnt uncovered in a snow covered feild
, where an airplane has crash l
anded
. inwhich thge plane threee men find
? the american dream
.
.
. iin a gym bag
.
? affliction too ws setted infact a snowy l
andscape
. it really seems very simple
. just hold on tothe the mone until spring
,
and if no one claims it
, tehy
' ll be safe to spend it adn theri hope of experiencing hte american dream can cmo true
. bu teh snow melts
, annd so might severeal ofthe tghe character
' s hopes
. as inthe
? return tothe paradime
?
, smoe of the characters are presented with a chance tothe do thte right thign
. bu donig tghe right thnig might not result in a better result tahn something more selfish
. tje movei
' s biggest strength is that it fatc makes sence
. i have seen many movies based on books thyat jstu seem like selected scenes ffrom thge book visualized
, eschewing anytying remotely ressembling a coherent story
-
- forthe example clear annd pesent danger
. the biggest problem seems to over
- familiarization with tje storey
. the writer perheaps feels thta he doesn
' t have tothe present scenes that are clear tothe him
,
but tghe lack of which onyl baffles an audiance which has nto read the book
. this is definetly nto thte probelm whith a simple plan
, even
though thge screenplay is by tyhe book
' s auther
. the movei is always claer on where it
' s going
, anbd alwyas makes sence
. i
' m sue a lot wass cut
,
but realy i cin
' t remeber what
. even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he hasnt paid for too much grains isnt included
. tghe man only comes infact on mondays
,
but he claimes tath he hasnt beeen charged for one purchase too many
. turns outloud
.
.
. well
, see yhe movie
. noe should be warned agains seeing the trailer
. it reveals sevral scenes fomr the endig moments
( hwihc yes
, like in the book
, it is a downer
)
, sevral plot developments
, adn much of tje beginnig
. bu much of this isnt nto spelt directly outloud during the trailer
, so if ytou
' re lucky
, you
' ll ahev forgotten about all of this when yuo see the movie
.
