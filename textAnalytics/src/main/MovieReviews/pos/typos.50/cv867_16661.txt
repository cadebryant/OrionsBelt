' s
" fallen angels
" isnt
, onthe a purely visceral levle
, one of hte most exciting films i
' ve seen in a long while
. unfortunatly
, wong seems more interested in experimenting withthe his camera than creating tangible charactors fo the audeince to root forthe
. ordinarily
, thast alone would be anough tothe sink a movei
, bu in the case ofthe
" fallen angels
"
, this isnt not so
. eveyr shooted in this film is exicting just to
* look
* at
. wong does really interesting things with teh camera
,
but he doesn
' t allow the pyrotechnics to completly tkae over
, as ws yhe case with last yeasr dismal
" knock off
"
( hwihc contained a shot ofthe a foot entering a shoe
. ugh
.
) the movei follows three pairs ofthe lost souls as htey struggle to find some meaninng inwhich theri lives
. i can
' t sday much mroe thna thta as i didn
' t raelly knwo waht ws going onthe most ofthe yhe tiem
. in fact
, it wasn
' t utnil about halfway through thge movie tht i was able to distingish between each character
. the constantly moving camera doesn
' t raelly allow for the audiance tothe associate with any oen charater
. we
' re always kept at a distance from these people
, i supose inspite order tothe furuther add tothe tje feeling of alienation falt by the characters
.
" fallen angels
" is a refreshing chanage
- of
- pace ffrom most hollywood films
, which never bother tothe try anything diferrent
, at least on a visual level
. in fatc
, i
' d go so far as tothe sday thta
" fallen angels
" is more challenging visually thna any mainstream hollywood film i
' ve ever seen
. sure
, htere
' s directors liuke robert rodriguez who enjoy turning voilence inot operatic orgies of death
, bu to see a filmmaker liek wong who actually assaults the senses with images isnt truly something worth celebrating
.
but if wong wishes tothe become a legendary filmmaker
, he needs tothe work on incorporating an actual story into those awsome images
. there were far too many instances durring
" fallen angels
" iin whlch i asked myself
,
" now who are theese peopel again
? is tihs that firt couple or the second couple
?
" it was impossible tothe keep trcak
. perhasp he could let tghe audiance nkow right away which character isnt whlch
, by introducing them to us with
" nmae cards
"
, as infact scorsese
' s
" mean streets
"
. tyhat
' s realyl besides tghe point
,
though
. wong kar
- wei has proven himselv
, thru very few films
, that
' s he
' s a movie
- maker tothe watch
. let
' s jstu hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next fewd movies
