allmost a full decade befor steven spielberg
' s saving private ryan asked whether a film sould be both
" anti war
"
and
" pro
- soldier
"
, john irvin
' s hamburger hill prooved it could
. lost in the innundation ofthe critical acclaim tath greeted oliver stone
' s platoon
, this excellent film was dismissed as
" too militaristic
"
. it
' s hard to underst
and exactlly why
-
-
- unless irvin
, inspite assembling his motley collecton ofthe young men who for predictable
(
and often naieve
) reasons
" chose to sohw uv
" fo tyhe vietnam debacle
,
-
-
- has refused tothe present us withthe thte stone killer
, drug
- stoked psycho anbd ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics waht
" the polack
, tje hillbilly anbd yhe kid from brooklyn
" became tothe wwii movies
. hamburger hill
, based onthe a true stoy
, is nto an easy film tothe watch
. there isnt a scene tyhat wiull hvea graying anti
- war activists squirming iin theri seats
, or moved to genuine tears
.
and hte climactic final assualt onthe the
" hill
" inaddition question is visually confusing
. gristly realities are presented in breif flashes
, as if the brain dared nto acknowledged what it hadnt encountered
.
and in thte mud
and smoke officer adn enlistee
, veteren anbd
" newbie
"
, balck soldier annd white
, become almsot indistinguishable from each otehr
, as htey do in yhe chaos ofthe actuall combat
. thge acting throughout is solid with an absolutly stellar performence rendered by courtney b
. vance as doc
-
- in a role thast will hvae many flatly disbelieving thta thsi is same ctor htey cheered as
" seaman jones
" in mctiernan
' s red octobur
. if yuo
' ve seen private ryan
, yuo owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill

- if onyl to determine thyat thge all the valour adn horror of spielberg
' s vision was as presnt in the ashau valley as it ws at omaha beach
