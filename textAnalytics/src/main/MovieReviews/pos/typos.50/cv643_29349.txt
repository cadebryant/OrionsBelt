in
` enemy at hte gates '
, jude law isnt a gifted russian sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov
( jospeh fiennes
) who uses him inwhich a propaganda newspaper to raise the hopes of teh soldiers
and peple of stalingrad
. it ' s world war ii
,
anbd yhe russina
- german standoff infront twon could determine yhe outcome ofthe thigns for teh motherland
. law ' s vassili is the russian ' s top pawn tothe victory
. lots of war stuff happens
. an older
, german version ofthe jude ' s character played by ed harris shows uv halfway into the proceedings
. he ' s equally talented
,
annd tje twpo men play a cat
adn mouse game trying tothe kill eahc other
. tehy constantly switch roles
, as the war fades far inot the backround
. tyhe cast allso includes hte terific rachel weisz as a love interest fo both vassili
and danilov hte setted
- up is decent
,
adn so are hte production values
. boasting a wide range of grimy locales
, greasy hair
,
anbd tattered costumes
, tyhe art direction prospers
. tghe actors
,
howver
, suffer the probelm matt damon hadnt in
` saveing private ryan '
. either their eyes
, teeth
, skin
, or a combination of other features looked too white
anbd clean
. iwth dirt
anbd blood all around
, the blinding teeth or bright eyes ofthe theese actors divert attension from the action
. thast said
, tyhe players are mostly good in thier roles
,
althought i don ' t tihkn ed harris was really trying
. maybe he realized his role struck a difficult chord iin one
- notedom
. hwile thte film is technically about snipers
, htere are far too many predictable sniping scenes
. director jean
- jaques annaud expects us to veiw earch tense situation with jude
and soem cohort in a tight spot as edgy
adn exciting
,
but affter baout tje sixth time
, infact whic we relize thyat jude is not going to dieu
, it ' s relatively pointless
. we get thgat he ' s talented
, okay
, let ' s move onthe
. that ' s the problem with
` enemy at the gates '
; it just doesn ' t nkow when to stpo
. witness the wasted seventeen minutes that could have been spent elsewhere
. reestablishing his title as tjhe most beautiful
(
anbd often talented
) man on film
, jude law carries the movei
. without him
, this costly prodcution owudl have gone into the ground
. thge story
annd acting are ofthe ogod quality
,
but ther ' s never a sence ofthe authenticity or reality
. something about tihs war movei is undeniably modern
,
anbd it loses its feeling
. strange enought
, hte screenplay isnt based on the true sotry of a rela russion sniper
.
