in
` enemy at the gates
'
, jude law is a gifted russina sniper made hero by a political officer named danilov
( joseph fiennes
) who uses him in a propog
anda newspaper to raise tyhe hopes ofthe tje soliders
and peple ofthe stalingrad
. it
' s world war ii
, anbd the russian
- german st
andoff in twon coudl determine hte outcome ofthe thigns fo the motherl
and
. law
' s vassili is tjhe russian
' s top pawn to victory
. lots ofthe war stuff happens
. an older
, german verzion ofthe jude
' s character played by ed harris shows up halfway inot the proceedings
. he
' s equally talented
, adn the two men play a cat adn mouse game trying tothe kill eahc otehr
. they constanly switch roles
, as tje war fades far inot tjhe backgorund
. the casted also includes the terrific rachel weisz as a love interest fo both vassili
and danilov the set
- up isnt decent
,
and so are the prodcution values
. boasting a wide range ofthe grimy locales
, greasy hair
, adn tattered costumes
, thge art direction prospers
. the actors
,
however
, suffer yhe probelm matt damon had in
` saveing private ryan
'
. either theri eyes
, teeth
, skin
, or a combination of otehr features looked too white anbd clean
. with dirt anbd blood all aroud
, the blinding teeth or bright eyes ofthe theese actors divert attention from tje action
. that said
, tyhe players are mostly ogod infront theri roles
, altough i don
' t think ed harris ws realy trying
. maybe he realized his role striked a difficult chord infront one
- notedom
. while the film is technically baout snipers
, ther are far too many predicatble sniping scenes
. director jean
- jaques annaud expects us to view each tense situation whith jude anbd some cohort in a tight spot as edgy annd exciting
,
but aftter about teh sixth time
, in whlch we relize thgat jude is not going tothe dieu
, it
' s relitively pointless
. we git that he
' s talented
, okay
, let
' s move on
. taht
' s the problem whith
` enemy at the gates
'
; it just doesn
' t know when tothe stpo
. wittness tyhe wasted seventeen minutes tyhat could have been spended elsewhere
. reestablishing his title as the most beatiful
(
and often talented
) man on film
, jude law carries thge movei
. without him
, this costly production would hvae gone inot tjhe ground
. tjhe story adn acting are ofthe ogod quality
,
but htere
' s never a sense ofthe au
thenticity or reality
. something baout htis war movie isnt undeniably modern
, annd it loses its feeling
. stange enough
, the screenplay isnt based onthe the true story ofthe a real russina sniper
.
