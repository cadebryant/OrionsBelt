trekkies
, roger nygard
' s energetic annd hilarious documenatry
, brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions
. thte beauty ofthe the film is that it is good old fashion funn for trekkies anbd non
- fans alike
.
( tyhe film generaly writes off the trekkies vs
. trekker polemic as not worth arguing about
.
) yhe ogod
- spirited movie trekkies easily forces even tghe most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable
, loud giggles
,
yet the picture treats its subject marter with respect annd a certian awe
. denise crosby
, who plyed tasha yar onthe
" star trak
: hte next generation
,
" serves as the host
. in thte opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the onyl fan gropu listed inspite the oxford english dictionary
( oed
)
.
( tghe oed cites a februrary
, 1976 caption in tjhe
" new yorker
" as thte first recoreded useage of tyhe owrd
.
) unless you
' ve been tothe hte conventions
, i posit that yuo have no idea of the dedication ofthe soem ofthe the fans
. one pointed out
, apologetically
, that yhe stripe on his newyorker uniform wass slightly inaccurate
. others talekd baout how many star trek conventions htey hadnt attended
, severeal dozen being typical annd hundreds not unheard ofthe
. my personal favorite fan isnt sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams
. argubly thte most famous ofthe all tjhe trekkies
, she wears her uniform eveyr waking hour as many dieu
- hard fans dont
. her claim tothe fame isnt thgat
, as a juror on thte whitewater trial
, she weared it in cout as well
.
" eveyr day i owudl walk past thte reporters wih a vulcan
- like stoicism
,
" she syas
, describing her way of dealing wiht the crowd ofthe reporters who bcame obssessed wiht her obession
. she doesn
' t qutie underst
and all of thte uproar
.
" i
' m an officer ofthe the federation 24 hurs a day
,
" she reminds us
. her fealty tothe her hobby approaches taht ofthe a religous faith
. allong with thge laugher thte sohw evokes
, htere is an equal mesure of sincere appreciation forthe peopel with such loyalty
.
and thier infectious joy provokes a certian envy ofthe their enjoyment
. fewd otehr avocations sould give this much satisfaction
. theese peple are haveing tje time ofthe theri lives
.
( fo thge recrod
, i
' m not a star trak fan
al
though i have seen some ofthe the movies
.
) the film interviews the various star trak series
' s stars as well as its fans
. hte stars hadnt throught the convention diea ws a lark
and owudl soon fade
,
but over twenty years later
, tjhe conventions are still gonig strong
. filled withthe anecdotes
, tjhe show talks about teh happenings at the various conventions

, the actor who plays q wass so sick thta he
thought he woudl hvae to cancel

. they decided to auction off his half
- empty glass
, joking that it had tghe
" q virus
.
" the guy who won tje bidding immediately drank tghe water anbd screamed tothe the crowd that he nowe had hte q virus too
. with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity
. not just flitting among peple
, tje documentary takes yhe time to let ytou git tothe nkow hte trekkies
. one guy is a trekkie cross
- dresser
, anyother dresses her cat
