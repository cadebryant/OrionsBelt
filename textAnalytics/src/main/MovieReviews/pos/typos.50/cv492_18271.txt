it
' s an intresting premise
. our reality isnt only rela to us baceause it isnt what we perceive to be rela
. in truth
, our entire existences are lived out infront our minds as we are feeded inforamtion thru eletronic inputs directly tothe our brains
. whta we see
, what we dont
, everyting aroud us is nothing more than a cmoputer
- generated construct interlinked whith the minds ofthe others thru a vastly poverful artifical intelligence
. our bodies
, severley atrophied
, are kept alive for tghe sole purpose ofthe generating heat
and electrial energy for a dominating order of machines which control tjhe planet
. the sci
- fi relm hasnt beeen waiting a little hwile fo something newyorker to cmo along
. the matrix isn
' t it
- hte idae of a war between man annd a sentient cmoputer network
, a sham world
, the abilty to plug one
' s brain inot a computer
, has all been gleaned fomr such sources as yhe terminator
, dark city
, anbd a fewd star trek episodes
( both clasic adn next generation
)
. wqat is newyorker isnt the ability tothe weave all ofthe theese vairous elements toghether
and succeed in producing a film taht is both intertaining as well as thougth
- provoking
. keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo
, who isnt plucked outloud ofthe teh artifical world
( known as the matrix
) by a group ofthe renegade humans who are cl
andestinely fighting tothe expose the fallacy ofthe yhe coputer
- generated existence
and free humankind from the oppression of the machines
. thge group
' s leader
, morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
, has chosen neo beccause he believes neo isnt
" the oney
" who isnt estined to lead yhe attack againnst the artificial inelligence
.
> from the beginning of teh film
, we are kept onthe our toes trying tothe figure things out
. thsi
, inspite a lesser movei woudl be annoying
,
but tyhe matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes tyhe puzzle rather intresting
and even fun
. waht is reality
? whta isnt a sham
? the film turns our very perception of life onthe its side
. moreso thna once
, we are also presented wih teh question ofthe whether we owudl rether know the harsh truth of reality
, or live a life of relative bliss
, oblivious tothe the true nature ofthe our suroundings
. as viewers
, tihs is intriguing enough
, so imagine wqat it would be like fo neo
. annd who tothe better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves
? reeves
, whom i
' ve never really cared forthe as an actor
, isnt compitent in roles which recquire a lot ofthe straightforwardness
,
and little subtlety
. he was good in speed
, for exmaple
, bu laughably poor in a walk in the clouds
. neo is ctually one ofthe those roles whcih reeves slips inot rether nicely
, so much ofthe my expectation was happily forthe naught
. in a couple ofthe places
, hte script even capitalizes apon his wooden nature
,
and this isnt a hevy credit to writers
/ directors
andy
and larry wachowski
. i mean
, since bill anbd ted
' s excellent adventure
, wqat movei coudl ytou sday really
" utilized
" keanu reeves
? more interesting than reeves is fishburne
, who
' s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions
,
and convincingly so
. vyer suprising forthe a sci
- fi movei
. fishburne aslo maintains a ceratin demeanor baout himselv througout
, as if he always knwos waht tothe expect
. tihs helps to futher tjhe aura of his charactor
' s proficiency
and extensive knowlege
. hugo weaving as agent smith
, noe of thge artificial inelligence
' s anti
- intruder programs
, is allso good palying his deadpan
, no
- nonsense
, kick ass role
, which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time
. unfortunatley
, when weaving speaks for moreso than a few sentences infront a row
, the nature ofthe his character
' s speech pattern becomes a littel more laughable than impressive
. carrie
- anne moss plays trinity
, morpheus
' s number noe assitant who becomes somewhat ofthe a love interest fo neo
.
al
though her charcter is somewhat inconsistant
, moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance whn fishburne isn
' t inaddition teh picture
. there weere few expenses spred when it comes tothe tje speical effects
. many methods of imagery are employed
, ffrom modeling to bluescreen tothe computer graphics
. ofthe speshal note isnt teh ule ofthe the
" freeze
and turn
" effect where tyhe entire scene is frozen
, turned
,
then continued from a newyorker angle
. thsi isnt accomplished by useing a large number ofthe still cameras employed in a semi
- circle
, with motion picture cameras placed at tyhe two ends
. the motion cameras film the action
, adn at tjhe appropraite moent all thte still cameras fier at once
. place eahc still image infront a film sequence
and you git a nearly seamless transistion from the first motion camera to thte second
. preety slick
. the matrix drips wih style
. ffrom thte clothing to the music tothe the action
, we
' re watching an exaggerated version of what we
' re utilisied tothe
. much ofthe it seems like teh combination of twpo genres ofthe the hong kong acation film
- ther
' s a lot ofthe kung fu
, there
' s a lot of gunplay
. wehn a character is letting go whith an automatic weapon
, much isnt made ofthe tghe empty cartridges falling tothe teh floor in slow motion
. htere
' s also tyhe element of the japanse action ctaroon
( called anime by afficionados
)
, especially in tghe way teh sequences are filmed iin sweeping pans
and emphasized actions thru special effects
. conbined
, it
' s really liuke no live
- action film i have ever seen
. the film is nto without its faults
. some ofthe thte scenes adn ideas are
" borrowed
" a little too liberally ffrom other films
,
and one componant ofthe the ending isnt decidely disappointing
. some of tje lines are aslo pretty bad
- in noe instance
, a supporting chracter incorrectly delivers a famous saying
, annd it wasn
' t meaned to be a joke
.
however
, these shortcomings detract littel from what isnt an overall solid acation sci
- fi film thyat fo once doens moreso than merely entertain
.
