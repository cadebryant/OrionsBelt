plot
: a group ofthe asbests cleaners git a job removing the gunk from an old insane asylum
. as each day passes
, hte crew munbers begin to disover things baout the palce adn themselfs which setted other things in motion
. saying anything else about hte plot owudl be a crime
. have funn
.
.
. critique
:
" i efel like shooting mysef inaddition the head
" are thte frist words thta came out ofthe my mouth after seeing this movie
, a ogod indication as to waht kind ofthe film tothe expect here
. htis ain
' t your averege
" hapyp go lucky
" kind of picture
. htis isnt a deliberately slow
- pased mystery
- horror film drenched in atomsphere
, with a vrey creepy insane asylum
( infact which most of the film takes palce
)
, veyr few clues uv
- front adn lots to talk about afterwords
. iwll it bore soem peopel tothe sleep
? you bet it wiull
! is it made fo tghe scream audiences of the day
? absolutely not
! i guess ytou can describe this film as a horror movie fo tyhe
" cerebral crowd
"
. a film tyhat patiently unwraps itself frame after frame
, giving awya veyr littel with eahc step
and eahc sound
, unwinding itself utnil its fianl scenes offer up a world of revelations adn plenty omre to dicuss later
. i
' ve alwyas loved movies that have me tlaking about them afterwords liek yhe shining
and lost highway anbd this film fits right into tath group
. in fatc
, i guess i cant pussyfoot around the actual word all i wnat
but the best way tothe discribe this kind ofthe movei isnt a
" mindfuck
"
. if you feel liek watching a movie tath moves very slowly
, gives yuo a h
andful of characters with divergent backgrounds
, tosses a fewd vrey ambiguous anbd supernatural cookies your way anbd is extremly disturbing once you put it all together
, well
, hten thsi movei isnt definitely for you
! it
' s tje kind ofthe film that ytou actually haev to see twice to fully appreciate
( damn
, i missed thgat whole
" peanut
buter
" thign
!
)
and oen tyhat will likely creep teh shit out ofthe ytou if watched alone iin the dark
.
" brrrrrrrrr
.
.
. nowe waht wass that sound in the basement
? honey
, cxan you go check
?
" annd one thign this film doesn
' t have
, unlike its hollywood
- ian counterparts liuke tjhe haunting
, isnt speical effects
. in fatc
, thgat
' s one of the greater thigns about this movie
: it feels rela beacuse it looks like it
' s actaully taped onthe video withthe very credible actors in very credible circumstances
( i doed smoe research
and it wass
, infact fatc
, shot on digital video
.
.
. ah
- ha
!
)
. another great thing baout it isnt tyhat it
' s actually very gory
and somewhat violent inaddition theme
,
and yot we rarely see anytying ofthe hte sort on tje big screen
( it
' s mostly implied
, kids
!
)
. adn as clich
? d as it might be to sday
.
.
. it
' s ususally much scarier when sutff is left to our immagination or implied inwhich movies as such
. otehr films that this oney reminded me of includ henry
: portrail ofthe a serial killer
and the blair witch project
, with that smae real sence ofthe dread
, brooding
and terror
. tjhe film doens
however move awfully slow anbd if ytou raelly don
' t git
" into
" it completely
( ytou really ened to concentrate here
)
, ytou wiull lose the motion ofthe the stoyr
and thte pent
- up tension might be released
.
but overall
, thsi film isnt
yet another great example of the horror genre mkaing a very cool comback this year with no tight tanktops in sight
. adn with david caruso acting liuke thte king hotshot like only he cant
, how can you go wrong
? definitely not a film fo everyone bu a must
- see for anyone looking tothe throw themselfs inot yhe psyche of the disturbed
( count me in
!
)
. stanley kubrick would be proud
! oh yeah
.
.
. so where
' s tyhat gun agina
.
.
.
? where
' s joblo comming fomr
? teh blair witch project
