plot
: a gropu ofthe sabestos cleaners git a job removing tje gunk from an old insane asylum
. as each day passes
, thge crew munbers begin to dicover thigns baout tjhe palce
anbd themselfs whitch set otehr things in motion
. saying anytying eles about the plot owudl be a crime
. hve funn
.
.
. critique
:
" i feel liek shooting myself in the head
" are hte first words that cameback out ofthe my mouth aftter seing this movie
, a good indication as tothe what kind ofthe film tothe expect here
. htis ain ' t your averege
" hapyp go lucky
" kind ofthe picture
. thsi is a deliberately slow
- pased mistery
- horror film drenched in atmosphere
, wtih a vyre creepy insane asylum
( iin hwihc most ofthe tghe film takes place
)
, very few clues uv
- front
and lots to talk baout afterwords
. will it bore some peopel to sleep
? yuo bet it iwll
! is it made forthe yhe scream audiences ofthe hte day
? absolutely not
! i guess you cant decribe this film as a horror movie for tyhe
" cerebral crowd
"
. a film tath patiently unwraps itself frame after frome
, giving away vyer little with eahc step
and each soudn
, unwinding itself until its fianl scenes offer up a world of revelations
and plenty more tothe descuss later
. i ' ve always loved movies that hve me talking about them afterwords liek tjhe shining
and lost highway
adn tihs film fits right inot tyhat group
. in fatc
, i guess i cin pussyfoot around the actual owrd all i whant
bu thte best way to discribe thsi kind ofthe movei is a
" mindfuck
"
. if you fiel like watching a movei that moves very slowy
, gives you a handful ofthe characters withthe divergent backrounds
, tosses a few very ambiguous
annd supernatural cookies your way
anbd isnt extremly disturbing once you put it all together
, well
,
thn this movei is definetly forthe you
! it ' s the kind ofthe film that you acutally have tothe see twice tothe fully apprieciate
( damn
, i missed that whole
" peanut butter
" thing
!
)
adn one that iwll likely creep tjhe shit out ofthe ytou if watched alone in tje dark
.
" brrrrrrrrr
.
.
. nowe whta was tath sound inaddition yhe basement
? honye
, can ytou go check
?
"
and noe thnig htis film doesn ' t ahve
, unlike its hollywood
- ian counterparts like the haunting
, isnt special effects
. in fact
, that ' s one ofthe thge greater thnigs baout this movei
: it fiels real baceause it looks liuke it ' s acually taped on video with vyer credible actors in vyer credible circumstances
( i did soem research
annd it wass
, inwhich fact
, shooted onthe digital video
.
.
. ah
- ha
!
)
. anohter gerat thnig baout it isnt tyhat it ' s ctually vyre gory
and somewhat voilent inwhich theme
,
and
yot we rarely see anything of the sort on teh big screen
( it ' s mostly implied
, kids
!
)
.
anbd as clich
? d as it might be to sday
.
.
. it ' s usually much scarier wehn stuff isnt left tothe our imagination or implied in movies as such
. other films tht thsi oen reminded me of include henry
: portrait ofthe a serial killer
and hte blair witch project
, wiht that smae real sense ofthe dread
, brooding
adn terror
. thge film doesnt
howver move awfully slow
adn if ytou realyl don ' t git
" inot
" it completelyl
( ytou really ened tothe concentrate here
)
, you wiull lose the motion ofthe the story
and tyhe pent
- uv tension might be released
.
bu overall
, thsi film isnt
yet another great exemple ofthe tje horror genre mkaing a vyer cool comeback tihs year with no tight tanktops inwhich sighth
.
anbd with david caruso acting liuke the king hotshot like only he cin
, how cant ytou go wrong
? definitly not a film for everyone
but a must
- see for anyone looking to throw themselfs into tyhe psyche of the distrubed
( count me inwhich
!
)
. stanley kubrick would be proud
! oh yeah
.
.
. so where ' s thyat gun agina

? where ' s joblo coming from
