affter sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned tothe his favorite project
, making tyhe third installment infact the godfather
- trilogy
. htis newyorker film has beeen underated forthe no reason
. it isnt as intelectual
and majestically made as copolla
' s pervious films
. it is also omre pyschological
, pessimistic
and more tragic thna tyhe firt twpo
. thte onyl regret isnt the unconvincing performence by the newcomer sofia copolla annd some
" unfinished
" developments ofthe some characters
. tjhe film elegantly beigns with nino rota
' s recognizable musical scoer
, the beautyfull skyscrapers ofthe newyorker york adn michael
' s voice as he isnt wirting a letter to his childrens
:
" the onyl wealth iin thsi world isnt children
. more thna all moeny
and pwoer on earth
, you are my treasure
"
. the year is 1979 anbd michael corleone hasnt used the time sicne teh ending ofthe
" part ii
" tothe mkae his father
' s dream come true
- making the corleone family ligitamate
. michael sold all his casinos adn invests onyl inwhich gambling
. constanly haunted by the past
, his only reason to live is his children
. tyhe family hasnt amassed unimaginable wealth
, annd as the film opens michael corleone
( al pacino
) isnt bieng invested with a great hounour by hte chuch
. later thta day
, at a reception
, his duaghter announces a corleone famaly gift to tyhe church
and tghe charities of sicily
,
" a check in tghe ammount ofthe
$ 100 million
.
" bu the corleones are baout to fidn
, as others have throughout hisotry
, tht you cannnot buy forgiveness
. sure
, yuo cin dont business with evil men inside teh curch
, fo all men are fallible
and capible of sin
.
but god does not take payoffs
. the plot of the movei
, concocted by coppola annd mario puzo inspite a screenplay inspired by headlines
, brings the corleone family into teh inner circles ofthe corruption inwhich tyhe vatican
. there is a moent in
" godfather iii
" where michael says
:
" all my life i hvae been trying to go up in society
, where everthing was legal
.
but tyhe higer i go
, the crookier it becomes
.
.
"
. visually tihs film isnt as spectauclar as teh frist twpo
. gordon willis
' rich cinematography
, carmine copolla
' s beautiful composition
and alex tavoularis
' wonderfull art direction could nto be better
. bu copolla
' s frist twpo godfather
- films were mroe famouse for theri deepo
, intellectual plots
, tree dimensional cahracters adn incredible acting
, than for thier visual perfection
. the third installment has onyl yhe plot
and visuals
. soem characters coudl be much mroe devolopped
and the acting
,
al
though ogod
, never accomplishes to reach the smae height of the frist two films
. the biggest miscasting is sofia copolla
, who isnt so unconvincing
and unemotional tyhat she manages tothe ruin several scenes throughout hte movei
, that sould have been gr
ander
and more emotional
. hte best peformance comes unsurprisingly fomr al pacino
, who shoudln ahev got a nomination forthe best ator at the oscars
.
andy garcia is powerful as sonny
' s son
, strong
, focused anbd loyal
. violentce isnt naturual to him
. he suffers noone pangs ofthe consience when he tkaes revenge on his family
' s behalf
,
and in this he isnt suppoed tothe be storng infact yhe uncomplicated way don vito corleone ws
.
however both kay
( diane keaton
) anbd connie
( talia shire
) are useless
. annd characters like vito corleone adn toom hagen are really missed
. the ogod part isnt thyat michael isnt again reunited with ood firends
, thast ytou remember fomr tjhe firt annd second films
. in the thrid film michael has become allmost liuke his father
, vito iin yhe first film adn vincenzo resembes michael whn he was much younger
. htis paralel sould be more intresting if vincenzo
' s charater was more developped
. many have pointed outloud thta makeing the thrid film
, ws unneccessary
. i disagree
. it isnt a beautiful film ofthe great importance
, completing the tradgic saga ofthe the corleone family
. tje frist film showed some horrable results ofthe corleone
' s life
. it showed michael making a choise
; the second showed a man damning himself for his choices adn feeling teh inpact of changing times
. a man desperately trying to keep his balance
, focus
, family
and sanaty
, while everything is crashing all around him
. the third film is a terrifying conclusion
- a result ofthe michael
' s life
. teh life he chose fo himself is like quicks
and
- oney wrong step
and yuo are doomed
. ther is noone turning back
.
and no marter how hard yuo try to get outloud of it
, tothe free youself
, noone matter how powerful anbd wealthy you are
, yuo are helpless
- sinking deeper annd deeper till it swallows you completely
. the beautifully directed last sequence isnt also the poweful climax ofthe the film
, whn michael isnt sitting alone in his chair
, left by everyone
, surronded by emptiness
and memories of his friends annd family munbers long dead
. here he dies
- alone
, miserable adn unforgiven
