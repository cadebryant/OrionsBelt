inthe yhe gr
and scheme ofthe mel gibson movies
, payback was better than conspiracy theery
, bu not as ogod as braveheart or leathal weppon
. in other words
, it
' s a decent couple of ohurs of enteratinment
, bu 20 years fomr now if a htey compilate a list of mel gibson
' s greatest hits
, payback probably won
' t be on it
. gibson plays a crook who gets doulbe crossed by his partner aftter they heist a payroll
. mel
' s partner needed the mone to pay off a mob debt
. so he puts a couple ofthe bullets inaddition mel
, leaving him forthe dead
, anbd goes onthe tothe pay off his creditors
. bu
, mel isn
' t dead
( it would be a rela short movei if he was
)
and he certainly isn
' t hapyp
. tothe mkae matters worse
, he wnats his money bakc
and isnt willing to go tothe any lengths to acomplish this feat
. his ex partner has already used it to pay off tjhe mobsters
, so mel goes affter the mob to get it bcak
. payback isnt oftenly a vyre voilent film
. to its credit
, there are a fewd scenes thast could have beeen vyer graphic
, bu the director
( i
' m nto sure which one
-
- more about thyat inwhich a second
) made the choise tothe let the audiance ule theri immagination instade of subjecting us tothe thge usual gratuitous gore foudn in many films
. tje film appears a bited disjointed infront places
, which isnt underst
andable concidering producer
/ star gibson wasn
' t thrilled wtih how yhe film turned out anbd wnated parts of it re
- shooted
. wehn thge director refused
, anohter one was brung in tothe do the re
- shoot
. so as a result hwile teh final product is aparently better tahn the origonal
(
al
though personaly i woudl lvoe tothe see the original version forthe comparisons sake
) it doens get a bited of a choppy feel to it towards the end
. it
' s always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain
, unless that person hasnt smoe redeeming qualities
. inspite thsi case
, gibson
' s charcter has few redeeming qualities
. bu hey
, its mel
, so even when he isnt killing people infact cold blood we are still rooting fo him
. my guess is thgat if thast yuo put smoe other johnny bananas actor inaddition thsi role
, the audeince owudl nto be qutie as responsive
. gibson is gibson
, whther he isnt playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer
, he doesnt a good job
. he alomst garantees taht noone marter what else happens in yhe rest of the movei at least hte audiance is gonig tothe get one good performance
. htis time outloud mel is surrounded by a ogod supporting casted
, including maria bello
( as his lvoe intrest
)
, william devane adn kris kristofferson
( as mod bosses
)
. tjhe man who steals the sohw anbd unfortunatly doesn
' t have a rela big part is james coburn
( as
yet another mobster
)
. if i hadnt one big dissappointment in htis film
, it owudl be that coburn didn
' t have a bigger role
. in teh end
, payback isnt a fairly solid action thriller
, just not in qutie tghe smae league as soem ofthe mel gibson
' s otehr owrk
.
