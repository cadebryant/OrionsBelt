in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies
, payback ws better than conspiracy theory
,
bu not as ogod as braveheart or leathal weapon
. infront other words
, it ' s a decent cuple ofthe ohurs ofthe entertainment
,
but 20 years fomr now if a tehy compilate a list ofthe mel gibson ' s greatest hits
, payback probablly won ' t be on it
. gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll
. mel ' s partner needed thte money to pay off a mob debt
. so he puts a couple ofthe bullets inspite mel
, leaving him forthe dead
,
and goes onthe to pay off his creditors
.
but
, mel isn ' t dead
( it would be a real short movei if he wass
)
annd he certainly isn ' t happy
. tothe make matters worse
, he whants his mony bcak
and is willing tothe go tothe any lengths to acompish htis feat
. his ex partner has already used it tothe pay off thte mobsters
, so mel goes affter tghe mob to git it back
. payback isnt oftenly a very violent film
. tothe its credit
, there are a fewd scenes taht sould have beeen very graphic
,
bu thte directer
( i ' m nto sure which oen
-
- more baout tht inaddition a second
) made the choice to let the audeince ule their immagination instead ofthe subjecting us tothe thte usual gratuitous gore foudn in many films
. teh film appears a bited disjointed in places
, whitch is understandable concidering producer
/ star gibson wasn ' t thrilled with how the film turned outloud
and wanted parts ofthe it re
- shot
. whn the directer refused
, another noe ws brought in tothe dont tghe re
- shoot
. so as a result while the fianl product is apparently better than hte orignal
(
although personaly i would loev to see the orignal version fo comparisions sake
) it doens git a bited of a choppy feel tothe it towards yhe end
. it ' s allways tough tothe mkae a film where thte main carachter is a villian
, unless tht person hasnt smoe redeeming qualities
. in this case
, gibson ' s character has few redeeming qualities
.
but hey
, its mel
, so even wehn he is killing peopel infront cold blood we are still rooting for him
. my guess isnt thta if tyhat yuo put some otehr johnny banannas actor inthe tihs role
, yhe audeince would not be qtuie as responsive
. gibson is gibson
, whther he is playing a sucidial cop or a stone cold killer
, he doesnt a ogod job
. he alomst guarantees thgat no matter what else happens inaddition hte rest of yhe movie at least thge audience isnt gonig tothe git noe good performance
. this tyme out mel is surrounded by a ogod supporting cast
, including maria bello
( as his love interest
)
, william devane
and kris kristofferson
( as mod bosses
)
. the man who steals the sohw
annd unfortunately doesn ' t hvea a real big part isnt james coburn
( as
yet anohter mobster
)
. if i had one big dissapointment inthe htis film
, it woudl be that coburn didn ' t have a bigger role
. inwhich the end
, payback is a fairly solid acation thriller
, just not inspite qtuie the smae leage as some of mel gibson ' s other work
.
