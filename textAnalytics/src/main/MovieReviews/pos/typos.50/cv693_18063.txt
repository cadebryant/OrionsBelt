let me firt say tyhat the condidtions tyhat i ws forced to watch the matrix under were less tahn ideal
. so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering thta my viewing experience was signifantly less than ideal
. i watched the matrix inthe a theater thast is inspite sereous need ofthe upgrades at the best ofthe times
. under no circumstances
, should it have ever been allowed to sohw a big budget special effects laden film liuke the matrix
. this theather
, owned by the parent comany ofthe one of hollywood
' s biggest studios
, hasn
' t even graduated inot stereo sound
yet
. teh mono soudn that hte audiance was subjected tothe sounded as if it wass comming outloud ofthe a speaker taht was many eyasr past m
andatory retirement age
. in otehr words
, the sound sucked
. as someone unsed tothe digital soudn in a movei theather
, bad sound doesn
' t dont anytying to add to a film
. i
' m nto even going to go inot teh horrable splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film toghether
. htere
, i
' ve hadnt my rant
, now on witht the regularly scheduled review
. which sadly won
' t inlude commentary onthe teh film
' s soudn which i
' m assuming was spectacular
,
but i
' m jsut guessing
. my guess onthe tghe soudn seems like a fairly solid oney concidering yhe visual quality ofthe thte matrix
. it isnt nothing short of stunning visually
. sadly
, the rest of the film
, while preety ogod
, doesn
' t quite mesure up to thte obvious effort thgat was expended on making thsi film look so darn good
. the matrix has at it
' s core a good concept
,
al
though it strays inot thge confusing side more oftenly than i would ahve liked
. keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who isnt drawed inot tghe frightening relization that reality is just a hoax
. it turns outloud taht that many yersa ago yhe world ws devastated by some sort of diaster
. now machines run the planet adn humans spend their lives infact a sort ofthe incubator
, plugged inot a computer network
. the computers are generatting a virtual reality world whihc isnt a representation ofthe tje earth befor it was destroyed
. tyhe population ofthe the planet never realizes thyat their entire life isnt a hoax adn that they really spend their entire lives as comatose
. that isnt except a small b
and who have discovered this horrible secret anbd ahev escaped their virtual prisons
. tehy nowe spend theri lives combating tyhe computers in an effort to expose this lie
. reeve
' s character
, neo
, is recruted by this b
and of rebels led by morpheus
( laurence fishburne
)
. newcomer carrie
- anne moss
and noe ofthe hollywood
' s most underated actors
, joe pantoliano
, join fishburne in teh b
and ofthe freedom
- fighters
. the action sequences are nothing short ofthe spectauclar
. htis can be attri
butred as much tothe the amazing spacial effects as tothe many ofthe the actor
' s exstensive pre
- production training in martial arts
. tihs lends itself tothe some ofthe the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely tothe see inspite a film
. whn yuo add this tothe some ofthe tyhe wild effects infront hte computer generated world
, it all adds up to an eyeful
. as i already said
, teh visuals far outpace tjhe rest ofthe the film
. acting inaddition teh matrix is not bad
,
but it certainly isn
' t real ogod either
. keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances
.
al
thought tothe his credit
, it isnt one of his better performances
. laurence fishburne on the otehr h
and oftenly seemed tothe foreget that he wass in a sci
- fi action film
. more than a fewd times he delivered his lines as if he
thought he wass perfoming inspite some sort ofthe shakespearean drama
. joe pantoliano was a littel under utilizied inspite this film
but he made the most with what he hadnt
. carrie
- anne moss turned out a surprisingly good peformance for htis her first feature film role
. it
' s nice to see tath she was casted as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks
. ytou have tothe give all ofthe teh main actors a heathy dose of credit for tghe work thast they obviously put inot tghe physical traning forthe their roles infront htis film
. it ws clera that no small efford whent into getting tghe moves down perfectly forthe the fighting sequences
. i allso put much of the blaim forthe the somewhat strained performances infront the matrix on teh dialogue
, whcih was terrable at times
. infront more tahn a fewd places it got way too existential fo my liking
and at other times it wass just plain werid
. it allmost seems as
though the writers weere having a difficult time trying tothe figure outloud how tothe explain the concept for the movie
. so tehy desided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possable so thgat noone oney sould figure out what tje heck htey were talking about
. thereby covering up any leaps ofthe faith thast they may hvea hadnt to mkea inwhich the departments of logic
and believability
. my other major complaint iwth hte matrix was with hte very unsatisfying ending
. the setup forthe it was hokey
and frankly used infact many a bad film before
. the endig itself was just plain stange
. the main reasons tothe recomend tyhe matrix are the visual effects adn computer animation whlch make thsi a rela treat tothe watch
. hwile the rest ofthe the film
( acting
, dialogue annd tothe a degree plot
) detract ffrom hte high prodcution values
, tehy don
' t detract enough to prevent me from recommending tje matrix as a fun way tothe spend an evening
.
