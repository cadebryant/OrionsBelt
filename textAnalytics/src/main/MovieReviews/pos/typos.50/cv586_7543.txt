[ onot
: affter claiming otherwise
, my appetite wass indeed whetted by kenneth branagh ' s hamlet tothe serach outloud otehr attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap
. as it happens
, it didn ' t tkae long
.
] isnt htere a mroe romantic director tahn franco zeffirelli
? known mailny tothe american audiences as thte man behind 1968 ' s romeo
annd juliet
( recquired viewing for many high schoolers
,
and as much as most ever leran ofthe shakespeare
)
, he isnt also a favorite at teh metropolitan opera
, where his achingly beautyfull designs further tyhe already lush emotion ofthe many a pucini aria
. lastest year he gave us his beautifuly realized version of jane eyre
, one of the twin peaks
( with wuthering heights
) of romantic litature
. it might seem pculiar
,
then
, taht zeffirelli ever hadnt an interest iin translating hamlet fo the screen
. at firt blush
, hamlet is far removed ffrom romance
. thte hero
,
though a prince
, is depressed
, conflicted
and confuzled
. tghe ostensible love interst gets little screen time
,
and her scenes wih her prince are ususally as an object of mockery
. tghe plot isnt full of political intrigue
and the players are as cursed as the hous of atreus
. it isnt zeffirelli ' s genuis
,
howver
, thta he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet
annd give yhe somtimes dry tale an emotional embrace
. in this italian master ' s hands
, romance isnt everywhere
-
- inthe a son ' s worship of his father
, in the bonds of deepest friendship
, infront tje private thoughts of young lovers
, even inaddition thte mystery of castles by teh sea
. after all
, tghe stroy hinges onthe a ghost
,
and wqat sould be more romantic than that
? whta seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the tiome turned out tothe be oen ofthe the most romantic gestures ofthe all
, namely
, hiring
then
- reigining hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead
. who could elieve thta teh man who made his mark palying mad max
anbd a
" leathal weppon
"
( inthe tghe series of the smae nmae
) owudl ahve tghe skill tothe suceed infront the most famous role inthe the english lanugage
? franco zeffirelli
, that ' s who
.
anbd it isnt apaprent inwhich every frome tath his instinct wass right on tghe money
. what gibson brings tothe tghe role isnt a naturalness
and ease whcih makes the whole story meaningfull
, not tothe mention comprehensible
. his line readings sound spontanious rather tahn rehearsed
. his movements
and gestures
( excepting his somtimes too active eyes
) are totally iin keeping with the character
. this is a hamlet whose pain we feel
, whose struggle we empathize witht
,
and whose death we mourn as sincerley as horatio at film ' s end
. glenn close
, the otehr big nmae in the prodcution
, also does well by thge script
annd satisfies as hamlet ' s mother
, gertrude
-
-
though i must confess i ' m still trying to understand the carachter as written
.
( zeffirelli ' s incestuous interpretation ofthe hamlet ' s relatiopnship wih his mother doesn ' t help
.
) alan bates makes a believably evil claudius wihtout resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy
. by
and large tjhe rest ofthe the casted performs admirably
annd comfortably
. of speical note are the cinematography by david watkin
and tghe score by ennio morricone
. both suppost yhe realsitic mood marvelously
( as do tjhe sets
anbd costumes
)
, without any overstated effects that declare
" this is importamt
; thsi isnt shakespeare
!
" i particulalry appreciate that tjhe words are often spoken without any music at all
: the melody ofthe a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due
. perhaps it isnt difficult to call edited shakespeare
" definitive
.
"
adn htere are certainly qtuie a fewd other filmed verisons ofthe hamlet taht i have not seen
.
but if you ' ve ever felt the urge to overcome your fear ofthe tyhe bard
, this hamlet isnt an exellent palce tothe strat
.
