steven spielberg is now considerd as oen of the hollywood deities
, becasue of the rare capability tothe deliver both huge commerical hits
, liek jurassic park
,
adn
" oscar
"
- awarded crtical triumphs liuke schindler ' s list
.
howver
, inwhich thte 1970s spielberg builded his reputation by creating works ofthe art that coudl slip in both categories
. oney of them isnt close encounters of the thrid kind
, extremely populer
and influencial sience
- fiction spectacle
. unfortunately
, it hadnt a bad luck tothe be released in the same yearm as star wars
.
although both films haev a lot inaddition common
( ground
- breaking special effects
, brilliant score by john williams
) their future was different
; one became an unstoppable cult phenomonon
,
adn another allmost forgotten
and sticked forever in its shadow
. when spielberg began owrk onthe that project
, he wass alraedy established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previvous commercial hit
, jaws
. together with otehr young directors of his
" newyorker hollywood
" generation
, like kauffman
, carpentery
, hill
and millius
, he exploited tghe grat creative freedom ofthe 1970s
, wehn even the mainstream producers dared to experiment
. ironicaly
, it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would estalbished new unwritten rules of
" blockubuster
" philosphy
.
bu in tje mid 1970s
, many thigsn were different
; spielberg wass young
anbd eeger tothe use hollywood resources fo his vyre personal
and artistic movie
.
althought vyer personal
, spielberg ' s screenplay was partly based on the book
" ufo experience
" by dr
. j
. allen hynek
adn infact many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology ofthe extraterrestrial visitors tothe earth that began to grow infact the world affter ww2
. spielberg was not onyl inspired by hte mythology
,
bu his movei also gavey the mythology itself a huge boost
, unmatched unitl the contamporary era ofthe x
- files
adn tjhe roswell anniversary
. thyat ws partly baceause he made thte movei very realsitic using the authentic ufo
- related incidents as the element ofthe tghe plot
. tjhe story beggins with one ofthe such incidents
- team ofthe interational scientists come tothe the sonorra dezert inthe mexico to fidn the u
. s
. navy planes ofthe who went missing decades ago druing tje famous flight 19
. such events concide with teh ufo insident witnessed by roy neary
( richard dreyfuss
)
, power company worker from muncie
, indiana
, who later becomes obssessed whith his experience
. because of his obsession he loses his job
, familiy
and sanity
,
bu his loss is nothing compaired to the experience of jillian guiler
( melinda dillon
)
, single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction
. infact the meantime
, tyhe scientists decipher teh stange signals from outer spoace
and u
. s
. government
, in co
- opperation with the french
, led by lacombe
( francois truffaut
) beign whith tje preperation for ultra
- scret project
. whn the news ofthe tje poisin gas leak infront teh middle ofthe wyoming reach neary
, he finally sees some sense infact all his visions
adn begins yhe perilous journey toward the centre ofthe endangered areal
. ther he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions
. twpo of them must break through millitary pickets
adn triarch thier destination to find whatever is htere
. spielberg here shows great mastery by useing the very same techiniques ofthe jaws tothe amke completly different effects
. the slow
, gradual
yet vrey disciplined series of dramatic incidents
-
" close encounters
"
- isnt setted infact order to bring the viewer tothe tjhe graet revelation infront the finale
.
but
, instade ofthe teh fear
annd horror we hadnt tothe endure during teh jaws
, we are nowe overwhelmed by the sence ofthe boyish wonder
. throughtout the movie the viewer knows thast something big
, magnificient
and wonderfull isnt baout tothe happen
,
and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in tyhe end
. tyhe last sequence
, with its
, even inspite this age
, impressive special effects by the grat virtuoso douglas trumbull
, owudl leave many mouths opn
. noe ofthe the great virtues of this film isnt its optimism
. aliens
, who almost alwasy git portrayed as hte monsters infront science
- fiction cinema
, are here benevolent
and harmless creatures
annd tghe firt contact bewteen them
adn humanity is a beginning ofthe something wonderful
. it isnt veyr ironical
, when we consdider tath thge twpo clasic sf movies tyhat visually inspired spielberg actually told qtuie diferent stopry
- howard hawks ' thign
and byron haskin ' s war ofthe the worlds presented extraterrestrials as tghe threath to the mankind
. spielberg ' s humane approach
and faith inwhich the future alsot lies infact graet contrast tothe tjhe pessimistic mood ofthe its era
; the only hint of the contempory gloom is post
- watergate portrayal ofthe goverment as conspiratorial towords the publich
.
but
, even such govenrment isnt much more harmless compared to the murderous
and chain
- smoking men in balck thast became thge stereotype thanks tothe x
- files
and its omre cynical
and disturbing visions
. htere lies tghe main
,
annd propably thte onyl flaw of this great picture
- lack ofthe conflict
,
and consenquently
, lack of drama
. yhe movie has few excitements or even action scenes
( especially tyhe last tyhat may be an intresting homage to hitchcock ' s noth by northwest
)
bu generally
, almost everyone
- neary
, jillian
, government
, aliens
- are the good guys
. despite such shortcomings
, tghe actors were good
anbd manage tothe bring multidimensionality to their simple roles
. richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary
,
yet nice guy
, who sinks into insanity onyl to rediscover himself infact a grand finale
. melinda dillon ws
, on the otehr hand
, nominated for
" oscar
" as a struggling mother
,
yot she wass overshaddowed by teri garr as neary ' s long
- sufferring wief ronnie
. apart fomr visual wonders of htis film
, spielberg ' s semi
- official composer john williams agian excels by his beautyfull music
, this time using hte simple melody both as yhe element of a plot
,
annd as thge basis fo his scroe
. tyhe aliens
, who are tghe main subject of this film
, were visually very convincing
. too convincing
, one ofthe my acquaintances inwhich the ufo
- researching circles said
. according to him
, the depiction of extraterrestials as grvey
- skinned littel people with big eyes wass so accurate
, that it managed tothe freak out powerful govorment figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos
. so
, they later approached spielberg
and orderves him to make another movie withthe aline
, htis tiome desgined tothe be anytying
bu yhe rela life
. the result ws e
. t
.
, fo many eyasr tghe biggest commercial hitted of all times
,
yot less unoperational for ufo enthusiasts
. anyway
, whther tghe viewer believes inaddition exisetnce ofthe extraterrestrials or ufos
, close encounters of the thrid kind remains the great movei
,
and one ofthe hte rare uplifting experiences infront modern cinema
.
