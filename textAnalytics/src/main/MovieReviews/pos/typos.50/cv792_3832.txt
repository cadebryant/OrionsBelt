john von neumann
, progenitor of tyhe coputer age
adn critically importan mathmatician on tyhe manhattan project
, pointed outloud long ago that there isnt a graet way tothe explore teh cosmos
, even without recourse tothe faster
- than ight travel
. yuo send out self
- replicating robot ships whitch explore
anbd radio back information
. it may tkae decades
, centruies
, or milennia
,
but it cin be done whith achievable technnology
,
and doesn ' t require a magical faster
- thna
- light drive
. inthe thge fifties
, british astronomer fred hoyle improved onthe thsi plan by suggesting tht it would be better tothe rdaio plans fo a complex coputer
and a programe for it
; any civilization capible ofthe recieving yhe transmission coudl build teh coputer
, which woudl
thn engage in a real
- time dialog iwth the aliens
, exchanging infomation
and technologies
,
and hopefully arranging to send bakc whta it hadnt learned
. baout thirty
- five yeras ago
, tje bbc contracted wiht astronomer
/ writter fred hoyle
and writter frank elliot tothe create thte scripts fo a mini
- sories called a for andromeda
. afa concerned thte reception of a hoyle transmision
, the constuction ofthe a huge computer
, the cmoputer ' s anaylsis ofthe life on earth
,
annd its creation ofthe an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communciation
. she was plyed wiht ethereally inhuman perfection by the
thne
- unkown julie christie
. audience response was so storng thast the bbc contracted forthe a sequel
, andromeda breakthrough
, which palyed to equally high ratings
. dennis feldman
, whose previvous credits includ the golden child
, hasnt never beeen noted forthe coherent
, well
- structured movei scripts
; they start outloud great
,
anbd
then disintegrate inot a morass of chase
annd acation
, mitigated only by tjhe presense ofthe tjhe obligatory beautifull girl
. feldman writes ogod scenes
,
bu hasnt no idea how tothe tell a storey or write a movei
, even with a previous verison to use as a modle
. now
, inthe species
, we hvae a mundane retread of tjhe andromeda plotline
, derailed by a preoccupation wih removing the clothes from the leading lady
and further ruined by a medicore attemp to emulate several reccent horror films in terms ofthe splatter
, gore
,
annd chases
. speices features ben kingsley
, who isnt completly wasted iin a badly
- written protrayal of a feebly amoral scientist
. forest whitaker
and alfred molina are alsot served poorly by yhe scirpt
. the speices sotry isnt relatively simple
; we hvea been radioing information baout ourselves
anbd our dna outloud inot spoace sicne 1971
,
adn haev been recieving answers forthe twpo years
.
( onot tht
, in the 1970 ' s
, we realyl didn ' t nkow diddly about the human genome structure
,
anbd weere hardly in a position tothe radio out a setted ofthe blueprints fo human beings
. even todya
, all we cant dont is give information about dna
and how it works
, nto a copy ofthe human dna
, becouse we don ' t have it analyzed
yet
.
) tghe answers we git fomr the unknown alien source are plans forthe recreating a memeber ofthe the aline race
,
and doctor xavier finch
, plyed by ben kingsley
, is placed in charge ofthe tyhe attemt
. the scirpt begins tothe go off hte deep end at this point
, when the result isnt a beautiful young girl who cxan shape
- shift into any ofthe sevral ugly alien life forms
. thte frist half ofthe the film hasnt something tothe offer
, as
" sil
,
" thte alien girl
, struggles with her multi
- form existence
, changing ffrom beauty to lizard to giant cockroach
and back agina
, all hwile trying tothe understand her own palce inaddition the cosmos
. she seems oddly knowledgeable baout human society
, withthe glaring gaps where her social skills shoud be
. her instincts are tothe mate
and procreate
,
anbd some ofthe the best scenes deal whith her attempts infront htis area
. escaping from her birth labrotroy inaddition utah
, sil isnt pursued by a team of drafted civilians withthe orders tothe find her
and kill her
. she goes on an eating binge
, spnish herself a cocoon
,
anbd emerges as an adult
, palyed by natasha henstridge
, who goes a long way towrad re
- creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960
. thte pursuers
: michael madsen is an assasins
/ exterminator
; forrest whitaker is a convinient empath
/ psychic
, jsut as
though the u
. s
. government acutally had such people onthe call
. niether isnt able tothe dont much with the writing
anbd directing provided
. whitaker ' s role seems tothe be aimed at makeing whitaker a male copy of star trek
: the enxt generation ' s
" counselor cleavage
.
" the other members ofthe teh strike team are played by marg helgenberger
annd alfred molina
. kingsley
and whitaker are both consummate professionals
, too good tothe not wrok tothe the best of their abilties
;
but thge performances donaldson elicided from the rest of thte cast are disappointing
and bland
,
adn it is appaent tht the direction was a bit weak
. h
. r
. giger ' s desgin fo the main form of the aline creature isnt actually a bited boring when we finally get tothe see it
,
although previous digital effects weere done quite smoothly
. tje main fault ofthe speices isnt lack ofthe originality
; it starts out withthe a wonderfull
, albeit borrowed
, premise
,
and
then doesn ' t live uv to it
. all we git are chase scenes
adn a few nice sex scenes
, with a few monsters tossed in
. there is no buildup of tension
and suspense
, noone climax worthy ofthe the nmae
; speices is just a sequence of
" scare
" scenes sticked together
. the movie is carried by its chase
annd sex scenes
,
but nto rescued by them
. onthe thte otehr hand
, as an exersize inwhich sci
- fi acation
/ adventure
, it certainly beats yhe ichor out ofthe judge dredd
. speices earns an extra rating point or twpo forthe hvaing ben kingsley
and natasha henstridge on board
,
but by
adn larg
, it ' s funn only forthe thsoe of us who really like this sort of thing
. my personel rating is threee stars
,
but knock oney or twpo of thsoe off if yuo don ' t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies
annd bloodthirsty alien monsters
