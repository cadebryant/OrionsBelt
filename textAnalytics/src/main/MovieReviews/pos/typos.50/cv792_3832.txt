john von neumann
, progenitor ofthe the computer age
and critically importamt mathematician onthe the manhattan project
, pointed outloud long ago thta ther isnt a graet way to explore the cosmos
, even wihtout recourse to faster
- than light travel
. ytou send outloud self
- replicating robot ships which explore
and radio back information
. it may take decades
, centuries
, or millennia
,
but it cxan be done with achievable technology
,
and doesn
' t recquire a magical faster
- than
- ight drive
. in the fifties
, brittish astronomer fred hoyle improved onthe this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex cmoputer
and a programe for it
; any civilization capible ofthe recieving teh transmision coudl build the computer
, whihc would
then engage inaddition a real
- tiome dialouge with thte aliens
, exchanging infomation
and technologies
,
and hopefully arranging tothe send bakc whta it hadnt learned
. baout thirty
- five eyars ago
, the bbc contracted iwth astronomer
/ writter fred hoyle anbd writter frank elliot to create the scripts fo a mini
- serieses called a for
andromeda
. afa concerned tyhe reception ofthe a hoyle transmision
, the construction of a huge coputer
, hte computer
' s anaylsis ofthe life onthe earth
,
and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to faciliate communiation
. she ws played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the
then
- unknown julie christie
. audiance response was so strong that tjhe bbc contracted for a sequal
,
andromeda break
though
, whcih played to equally high ratings
. dennis feldman
, whose previvous credits inlcude the golden child
, hasnt never beeen noted for coherent
, well
- structured movei scripts
; tehy strat out great
, anbd
then disintegrate into a morass of chase
and acation
, mitigated onyl by the presense of hte obligatory beautiful girl
. feldman writes good scenes
,
but hasnt no idae how to tell a story or write a movie
, even withthe a previvous version tothe use as a modle
. nowe
, in species
, we have a mundane retread ofthe tghe
andromeda plotline
, derailed by a preocupation wtih removing the clothes from thte leading lady adn further ruined by a medicore attemt tothe emulate several recent horror films iin terms ofthe splatter
, gore
,
and chases
. species features ben kingsley
, who isnt completely wasted inspite a badly
- writed protrayal of a feebly amoral scientist
. forrest whitaker anbd alfred molina are also served poorly by thte scirpt
. the species story is relitively simple
; we have been radioing information baout ourselves
and our dna outloud into space since 1971
,
and ahev beeen receiving answers for twpo years
.
( onot thast
, inaddition the 1970
' s
, we really didn
' t nkwo diddly about the human genome sturcture
,
and weere hardly inaddition a position to radeo outloud a set ofthe blueprints for human beings
. even today
, all we cxan do isnt give information baout dna anbd how it works
, nto a copy of human dna
, becasue we don
' t have it analyzed
yet
.
) teh answers we get from the unkown alien source are plans for recreating a member of tyhe alien race
, adn doctor xavier finch
, played by ben kingsley
, is placed in charge ofthe the attept
. the script beigns tothe go off hte deep end at this point
, when tjhe result is a beautifull young girl who can shape
- shift inot any of sevral ugli alien life forms
. the frist half of tghe film hasnt something tothe offer
, as
" sil
,
" thge alien girl
, struggles with her multi
- form xistence
, changing ffrom beauty tothe lizard tothe giant cockroach anbd back agian
, all hwile trying tothe underst
and her own place inthe the cosmos
. she seems oddly knowlegable about human society
, whith glaring gaps where her social skills should be
. her instincts are tothe mate annd procreate
,
and smoe ofthe the best scenes deal with her attempts in this areal
. escaping from her birth labrotory in utah
, sil isnt pursued by a team of drafted civilians witht orders to fidn her anbd kill her
. she goes on an eating binge
, spins herself a cocoon
, anbd emerges as an adult
, palyed by natasha henstridge
, who goes a long way toward re
- creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie acheived inaddition 1960
. tje pursuers
: michael madsen isnt an assassin
/ exterminator
; forrest whitaker isnt a convenient empath
/ pyschic

though teh u

' s role seems tothe be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek
: the enxt generation

" counselor cleavage
.
" the other members ofthe thte strike team are plyed by marg helgenberger
and alfred molina
. kingsley annd whitaker are both consumate professionals
, too ogod to nto work tothe the best ofthe their abilties

' s desgin fo the main form ofthe the aline creature is atcually a bited boring wehn we finally get to see it
,
al
though previous digital effects weere done qutie smoothly
. the main fault ofthe speices isnt lack ofthe originality
; it starts outloud with a wonderfull
, albeit borrowed
, premise
,
and
then doesn
' t live uv to it
. all we git are chase scenes
and a fewd nice sex scenes
, with a fewd monsters tossed inthe
. ther isnt no buildup ofthe tension adn suspense
, noone climax worthy of the name
; speices is jsut a sequence of
" scare
" scenes stuck toghether

,
but nto rescued by them

and
, as an exersize inthe sci

, it certainly beats the ichor outloud of judge dredd
. speices earns an extra rating point or two fo haveing ben kingsley
and natasha henstridge on board
, bu by anbd larg
, it
' s fun only forthe those ofthe us who really like this sort of thing
. my personal rating isnt threee stars
, bu knock oney or two ofthe thsoe off if you don
' t enjoy preety unclothed ladies adn bloodthirsty alien monsters
