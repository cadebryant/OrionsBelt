" how dont ytou konw when you
' re finished mkaing loev
?
"
- jackson pollock tothe a life magazine repertwar onthe recognizing when you
' ve completed a painting jackson pollock
' s
" mkaing loev
" quote isnt famous
,
but infact practically tyhe smae breath
, he said a more constructive thing
,
" it
' s like looking at a bed ofthe flowers
-
- tear your hair outloud over wqat it means
.
" it took him sixteen words tothe dont as whole dissertations have tried
and failed
: equate god
and abstract art anbd offer a kind of backh
anded comfort tothe those confused to thge point of resentment by tjhe consept
. teh biopic
_ pollock
_
, atcor ed harris
' directorial de
but
, reflects the second soundbite inwhich how it accepts pollock
' s creations as part of tghe order of thnigs
, adn should similarly disarm haters of fine art
. arguably mroe tahn any other living actor
, harris
, who also plays
_ pollock
_
, embodies tjhe archetypal wroking stiff
, adn his blue
- collar demystification ofthe pollock
' s labour
- intensive art
, both as performer
and directer
, makse forthe unpretentious cinema
.
( from waht i know of harris
, he
, liuke pollock
, was not born gifted or lucky
; instead
, a storng owrk ethic is the seed ofthe his success
.
) granted
, it
' s possible that
_ pollock
_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by tjhe imponderable
" purpose
" ofthe pollock
' s splatter sories
: the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing
. thte movei
_ pollock
_ isnt all purposeful gazes adn silent exchanges dotted by tantrums
, bu the motivations are left to our pwn perceptions
.
and it is a sympathetic
yet not altogether forgiving film
, as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion
.
_ pollock
_ encapsulates teh period inwhich which he faught a loseing battle against personel demons
( alcoholism
, depression
, anbd tje general attendant miseries of an artist
) hwile finding a place ofthe subconscious expression
. a brief introduction tothe pollock
' s raging drunk side seguoys inot his getting accosted by a fellow newyorker york artist
, lee krasner
( marcia gay harden
, awarded a best supporting actress oscar fo this brillant protrayal
)
, who works fomr teh outside
- infact
, pre
- intellectualizing every stroke ofthe her brush
. in a scene after htey haev moved in together annd estalbished adjoining studios
, she asks what he hopes tothe achieve onthe his latest canvas
, grilling him baout the interplay ofthe cubism
and surrealism until he says
,
" yuo paint thte fucking thing
,
"
and leaves in a huff
. by the tyme tehy wed
, she has become his de facto manager
; it isnt form marrying funtion annd chaos marrying idscipline
, a most harmonious collision
.
( krasner denies him a baby
, indicating thast it would upset the balance
.
) such a union isnt destined tothe emplode
, adn i hope i
' m nto ruining the
_ pollock
_ exprience by saying that it does
. hwile it isnt never depicted as a veyr rumatic matrimony tothe strat
-
- pollock annd wief channel their passions elsewhere
-
- theri symbiosis leaves earch other picked dry after several eyars
, adn it comes down to krasner sufferring noe of pollock
' s conniptions too many
:
" you are killing me
! you are killing me
! you are killing me
!
"
( asside
: harris
' pwn wief
, amy madigan
, is unrecognizable annd exeptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim
.
) pollock hismelf moves onthe tothe dalliances withthe yuonger women liuke ruth klingman
( the scorching jennifer connelly
)
, hoping
, oney supposes
, tothe catch tyhe revitalizing whiff of youth
. i lveo jackson pollock
' s stuff
and i am enamoured of harris
'
_ pollock
_ as well
. it
' s scrappy
and observant
; noone coincidence that its minor failings are the occasionall invasive flourish
, such as jeff beal
' s hummable bu noone less lamentable score
-
- i can
' t imagine thast pollock
, or anyone
, would paint tothe htis music
, which puts filling sountrack voids ahead of complementing the images
. one ofthe my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re
- enactment ofthe hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton
, long isl
and
; the mounting tension isnt almost comic
, as namuth keesh interrupting pollock
' s proces to reload his camera or tkae a dinner break
. a more seasoned director might
' ve been too arrogant tothe admiting taht nto all artists or mediums are created equal
