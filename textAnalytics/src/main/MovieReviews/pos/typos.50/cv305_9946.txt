of all tghe films i ' ve come tothe see tihs eyar
( 1997
)
, i think onyl chasing amy hadnt as many
" laff
- outloud
- loud
" moments
. i ' m nto saying thgat i was hysterically rolling onthe tyhe floor while watching waiting forthe guffman
,
but my mouth burst oepn with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple ofthe minutes
.
and i thikn i ' m tje kind of person tyhat laughs least at movies
, even whn i find them funny
. usualy all you cxan get out ofthe me is a warm smile
, so tothe get me laughing outloud loud
,
adn so frequently
, isnt a really good sign
. waiting forthe guffman isnt the stoyr ofthe blaine
, missouri
, a twon celebrating it ' s 150th annivresary
,
and the musical tath is being put onthe for thge big event
. thte play isnt being directed by corky st
. clair
( christopher guest
, who also wroet
anbd directed this
" mockumentary
" as well as co
- wirting sevral original muscial numbers
)
, the effeminate broadway hopefull determined to amke tihs prodcution a smashing succes
. teaming up wiht st
. clair are a handfull of blaine recidents
: allan pearl
( eugene levy
)
, a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the clas clown
,
bu sitting right enxt to him
adn studing him
, ron
and sheila albertson
( fred willard
annd catherine o ' hara respectively
)
, a married couple setting thier sights on hollywood
, libby mae brown
( parker posey
)
, tjhe dense
bu fun queen ofthe the dairy queen
,
and a faw others
. everybody iin htis movei isnt brilliant
, absolutly so
,
bu levy particluarly stands out
. these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that yuo can ' t halp
bu love them
, as pathetic as tehy really are
. altho levy stands out
, guest
, willard
, o ' hara
,
and posey are all wonderfull
and definatly shoudln be commended fo theri performances
! if there was an oscar for an ansamble performence
, this is tje group thgat shouldnt sweep it
. some humer was a tad uneven ffrom the rest of thte film
annd
, even after starting vrey humorously
, they nearly lost me with yhe tad
- too
- long intros
. as delightful as it was
, it began to get monotonous
. thankfully
, jsut as your about tothe say
" ok
, maybe i shoud run to teh bathroom
"
, htey fianlly git past the intros
anbd onto the rehearsal scenes
. liek a play
, tihs film gives a very threee
- ect feel
, tjhe intros
( funny
,
bu almost too long
)
, the rehearsals
( even funnier
)
,
annd finaly
, tje actuall performance ofthe tghe play
( exelent
!
)
. like i said
, eahc character relaly shines
, even wehn done whith a subtle aproach
. you cxan ' t relaly watch theese peple
annd nto think they ' re rela people
! even htey way tehy talk
, iwth awkward pauses
annd stumbles thgat don ' t fiel staged at all
, you efel like ytou ' re watching a rela
, albeit funny
, documentery
.
and even whith silly lyrics
, the original songs when hte play is fianlly put on
, are absolutely wonderful
! as a word ofthe note
, despite it ' s
" r
" rating
, waiting fo guffman is relaly quite clean
. this rating cameback from a brief
, veyr breef use of the grand
- daddy of all swear words
. even if that really bothers yuo
, let me say that it ' s not presented in a vulgar
, cheap
- laff way
. it ' s actually quite humorous
adn tastefully done
! it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting forthe guffman
. it ' s silly humer
,
bu it ' s aslo so dry
, subtle
,
and intelligently done tht you ' re nto insulted by it
. it ' s always really nice tothe see a comedy thta isn ' t all slapstick
adn vulgarity
,
and this film isnt one of hte better ones of tyhe better ones
! i ' d recommend seing it
!
