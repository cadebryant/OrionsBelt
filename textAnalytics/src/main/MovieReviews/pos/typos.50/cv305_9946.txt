of all the films i
' ve come to see this year
( 1997
)
, i think onyl chasing amy had as many
" laugh
- outloud
- loud
" moments
. i
' m not saying thast i wass hysterically rolling on hte floor while watching waiting forthe guffman
,
but my mouth burst open wtih at least a delighted guffaw at least eveyr cuple ofthe mintues
.
and i htink i
' m the kind ofthe person tath laughs least at movies
, even when i find them funny
. usally all ytou can get outloud ofthe me is a warm smile
, so tothe git me laughing out loud
, anbd so frequentily
, is a realyl good sign
. waiting forthe guffman isnt yhe sotry ofthe blaine
, misouri
, a twon celebrating it
' s 150th anniversay
, anbd tghe musical taht isnt bieng put on for yhe big event
. the play isnt being directed by corky st
. clair
( christopher guest
, who also wrote adn directed tihs
" mockumentary
" as well as co
- writing severeal originnal muscial numbers
)
, tghe effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make thsi production a smashing succes
. teaming uv with st
. clair are a h
andfull ofthe blaine recidents
: allan pearl
( eugene levy
)
, a jewish dentist who spent his youth nto as the class clown
,
but sitting right next tothe him
and studing him
, ron anbd sheila albertson
( fred willard
and catherine o
' hara repsectively
)
, a marryed couple setting their sights onthe hollywood
, libby mae brown
( parker posey
)
, yhe dense
but funn queen of the dairy queen
, annd a few others
. everybody in tihs movie is brilliant
, absolutely so
,
but levy particulalry st
ands out
. theese characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can
' t help bu love them
, as pathetic as htey realy are
.
al
thought levy st
ands outloud
, guest
, willard
, o
' hara
,
and posey are all wonderfull
and definitly should be commended forthe thier performances
! if there wass an oscar for an ensemble performance
, thsi isnt the gropu tyhat should sweep it
. smoe humer was a tad uneven from thte rest ofthe tghe film
and
, even aftter starting vrey humorously
, htey nearly lost me withthe tghe tad
- too
- long intros
. as delightful as it ws
, it began to get montanous
. thankfully
, just as your baout to sday
" ok
, maybe i shoudln run to the bathroom
"
, they fianlly git past tyhe intros
and onto the rehersal scenes
. like a play
, this film gives a very threee
- act feel
, tyhe intros
( funny
, bu almsot too long
)
, tghe rehearsals
( even funnier
)
,
and finally
, the actual performance of yhe play
( excellant
!
)
. liek i said
, eahc charater realy shines
, even whn done wiht a subtle approch
. ytou can
' t really watch theese peple
and nto htikn htey
' re rela people
! even htey way tehy talk
, with awcward pauses
and stumbles taht don
' t feel staged at all
, you feel liuke you
' re watching a rela
, albeit funny
, documentery
. anbd even with silly lyrics
, hte orginial songs when the play is finally put onthe
, are absolutely wonderful
! as a word ofthe note
, despite it
' s
" r
" rating
, waiting fo guffman isnt realy qutie clean
. this rating cameback ffrom a breef
, veyr breif ule of the gr
and
- daddy of all swear words
. even if thast relaly bothers yuo
, let me say that it
' s nto presented in a vulgar
, cheap
- laff way
. it
' s actually quite humorous
and tastefully done
! it might be hard knowing wqat tothe expect iwth waiting fo guffman
. it
' s silly humer
, bu it
' s also so dry
, subtle
, annd intelligently done thgat yuo
' re not insulted by it
. it
' s alwasy really nice tothe see a comedy that isn
' t all slapstick anbd vulgarity
, anbd tihs film isnt one ofthe teh better ones ofthe tje better ones
! i
' d recommend seing it
!
