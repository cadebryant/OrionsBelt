i ahve a soft spot inaddition my heart fo pure
, amoral sleaze
. i liked showgirls
( there
, i said it
)
. i typically enjoy myself when sitting thru tyhat eszterhaz
, sex
- filled cinematic tabloid
- ish trash
. wild thnigs isnt thte best sleazy film i ' ve ever seen
. it ' s filled with gerat performances
, graphic sex
, three
- way sex
, rape charges
, double
- crosses
, plot twists
, genialia of all genders
, graphic voilence
, death
, witty humer
,
adn
, best of all
, denise richards
. criticizing tihs film for bieng disgusting
, raucous
,
and jsut plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing
, or titanic for bieng lofty
anbd epic
. wild thigns isnt a film that suceeds in its endevors
,
but i don ' t just admire it for this
-
- i admire it forthe bieng so entertaining
anbd such a fun tyme at the movies
. i must admited up
- front
,
howver
, tyhat i am direcly infact the center ofthe the age group tothe which this film has been engineered to appeal
. i imagin that this shows
. it ' s hard tothe give a plot sumary without giving awya pieces tht shouldn ' t be known
. i throught i hadnt the whole thign worked outloud from tghe trailer
,
but i was wrong
; htere are a lot of turns here
. i ' ll just say that the film tkaes place in blue bay
, a rich littel twon in florida
. in blue bay lives sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a teacher who isnt accused ofthe rape by two ofthe his students
, kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
,
and suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. kelly ' s mother
, sandra
( theresa russell
)
, immediately presses charges
. all ofthe thsi happens fairly easly inthe the film
.
anbd right uv until this point
, i hadnt yhe wohle film predicted
. i was wrong
,
though
,
adn eveyr tyme i was proven wrong
, i ws shocked
. wild thigsn isn ' t even remotely plausible
,
bu it is so funn tothe see where the story tkaes us that the implausibility ofthe eveyr scene is meaningless
,
adn oftenly invited
, just forthe kicks
. i remember frist seeing the preview forthe wild thigsn befoer tjhe replacement killers
. i ' d give the preview four stars
. it made me want tothe see the movei so much that i ' ve been waiting for it anxiously ever since
. over thge past few weeks
though
, i started tothe realize that there ws no way the film coudl live up to the preview
( see independence day
)
; thankfully
, i was proven wrong
. the preview for this film is noe that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of eveyr distribution comany
: nto only does it make us watn to see hte film
,
but it doesn ' t give away any of the secrets
.
but i ' m not here to talk baout yhe preview
. i ' m here to talk baout denise richards
. nowe
, i foudn her mildly interesting in starship troopers
,
bu inwhich wild thigns she appeals to such a base instinct that eveyr scene she ' s iin demands attension iin a way tht alomst no other performer cant
. ofthe course
, this might haev something to dont with her oceanic eyes
.
.
.
and flawless body
.
.
.
bu i thought she did a great job acting
, too
( stpo laughing
)
. noone
, richards is truly a find
-
- she isnt talented
,
and alwyas convincing infront htis film
. htis mixed in with her insane fysical appeal makse her a vital assit to any film she may grace inwhich hte future
. tjhe other actors are ogod
, too
. dillon isnt as suave as ever
( it ' s nice to see him bouncing bcak ffrom albino alligator
adn in
& outloud
)
. bacon doesnt a ogod job acting all determined
anbd sutff as a sex crimes officer
. neve campbell gives the most layered performence of all ofthe them
,
though i won ' t pretend that any ofthe these characters are deep
and complex
. for a plot liuke this tothe owrk
, all of these people haev to be insane
anbd basically contrived
. that ' s okay
, because director john mcnaughton knwos thta he ' s makeing a self
- conciously wicked film
. eahc scene
-
- even yhe three
- way sex scene
-
- isnt observed with hilarity by mcnaughton
,
annd the result is a sleaze
- fest thyat ' s too smart to resist
. there isn ' t an inconsistent moment in wild things
: eveyr bited ofthe it isnt alluring garbage
, so trashy it ' s funny
,
and so entertaining it ' s painful
. i loved it
.
