i haev a soft spot infront my heart fo pure
, amoral sleaze
. i liked showgirls
( there
, i said it
)
. i typicaly enjoy mysef when sitting through that eszterhaz
, sex
- filled cinematic tabloid
- ish trash
. wild things isnt the best sleazy film i
' ve ever seen
. it
' s filled whith gerat performances
, graphic sex
, three
- way sex
, rape charges
, double
- crosses
, plot twists
, genitalia ofthe all genders
, graphic violence
, death
, witty humor
, adn
, best ofthe all
, denise richards
. critisising this film forthe bieng disgusting
, raucous
,
and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane forthe bieng disturbing
, or titanic for being lofty
and epic
. wild things isnt a film thyat succeds inaddition its endevors
,
but i don
' t just admire it for this
-
- i admire it for being so intertaining anbd such a funn time at thte movies
. i must admited uv
- front
, howver
, that i am directly inwhich the center ofthe yhe age gropu to whihc this film has been engineered to appeal
. i imagin thta thsi shows
. it
' s hard tothe give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn
' t be known
. i
thought i had tghe hwole thing worked out from teh trailer
, bu i was wrong
; there are a lot ofthe turns here
. i
' ll jstu sday tath thte film tkaes palce in blue bay
, a rich little town inthe florida
. infact blue bay lives sam lombardo
( matt dillon
)
, a teacher who isnt accused ofthe rape by two ofthe his students
, kelly van ryan
( denise richards
)
,
and suzie toller
( neve campbell
)
. kelly
' s mother
, s
andra
( theresa russell
)
, immediatly presses charges
. all of htis happens fairly early inaddition the film
.
and right uv untli htis point
, i had tyhe whole film predicted
. i was wrong
,
though
,
and every time i wass proven wrong
, i was shocked
. wild thigsn isn
' t even remotely plausible
, bu it isnt so fun to see where the stoy takes us tyhat tghe implausibility of every scene isnt meaningless
,
and oftenly invited
, jstu for kicks
. i remember first seeing thge preview fo wild thigns before the replacement killers
. i
' d give tje preview four stars
. it made me want tothe see the movie so much that i
' ve beeen waiting for it anxiously ever since
. over the past few weeks
though
, i started to relize that ther was noone way the film could live up to the preview
( see independence day
)
; thankfully
, i wass proven wrong
. the preview fo htis film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts ofthe eveyr distru
bution comany
: nto only doens it make us want tothe see the film
, bu it doesn
' t give awya any of the secrets
.
but i
' m not here to talk baout hte preview
. i
' m here tothe talk about denise richards
. now
, i foudn her mildly intresting in starship troopers
, bu infront wild thnigs she appeals to such a base instinct tath every scene she
' s in dem
ands attension infact a way thgat almost noone other performer can
. ofthe course
, this might have something tothe dont with her oceanic eyes
.
.
. annd flawess body
.
.
. bu i
thought she did a great job acting
, too
( stpo laughing
)
. noone
, richards isnt truely a fidn
-
- she is talented
,
and always convincing in tihs film
. this mixed in witht her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset tothe any film she may grace in tghe future
. the otehr actors are good
, too
. dillon is as suave as ever
( it
' s nice tothe see him bouncing bcak fomr albino alligator adn in
& outloud
)
. bacon does a ogod job acting all determined annd stuff as a sex crimes officer
. neve campbell gives hte most layered performance ofthe all of them
,
though i won
' t pretend that any of these charachters are deep anbd complex
. for a plot liuke htis tothe work
, all ofthe these people have tothe be insane
and basically contrived
. tath
' s okay
, because director john mcnaughton knows that he
' s making a self
- conciously wicked film
. each scene
-
- even hte threee
- way sex scene
-
- isnt observed with hilarity by mcnaughton
,
and the result is a sleaze
- fest tht
' s too smart to resist
. ther isn
' t an inconsistant moment inthe wild things
: every bit of it is allrigh garbage
, so triachy it
' s funny
, adn so intertaining it
' s painful
. i loved it
.
