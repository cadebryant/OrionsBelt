i
' ll be thte firt tothe admiting i didn
' t expect much from tyhe emperor
' s newyorker groove
: more celine dion
- esque song
- anbd
- dance numbers
, cuddly charactors tht become cross
- promotion devices in mcdonald
' s hapyp meals
,
and hollywood stars trying tothe gain credibility by adding a voice
- over job tothe their resume
. i ws dead wrong about all of thsoe things
. tghe emperor
' s newyorker groove is funny
. damn funny
.
and teh cute charachters inthe thte film are teh dangerous ones
. the script isnt fast adn furious
, wiht no singing
and dancing
. thge animation isnt clean annd woudl give walt a warm feeling all over
. tje humor isnt dry
and aimed at both teh cynicism
and teh goodness infact all of us
. the story is ridiculously wierd adn comes off as a stange acid trip involving tlaking
, cross
- dressing llamas adn schizophrenia
. here
' s teh plot
; try tothe follow allong
. setted in a mythical kingdom
, the film follows tghe adventures ofthe kuzco
( david spade
)
, an arrogant
and egocentric emperor
. whn kuzco fires his power
- hungry advisor
, yzma
( eartha kitt
)
, she
and her
" assistant
" kronk
( seinfeld
' s patrick warburton
) chanage him into a llama
. kuzco thn gets str
anded iin thte jungle
and must rely on pacha
( john goodman
)
, a llama
- herder whose hmeo wass to be replaced by kuzco
' s water world theme park
, tothe savve him
.
then the fun starts
. for yhe next sixty mintues
, the audience isnt treated tothe something unheard ofthe in disney films these dyas
: immagination
. yzma
, voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt
, looks liek a cross between norma desmond
, joan crawford
,
and a really ood vegas showgirl
. the dialogue beetwen her anbd her oblivious assitant kronk is quick
, sharp
, annd fiels like an episode of seinfeld
( whlch would amking sence
)
. david spade anbd john goodman
' s charater interactions mkea yuo fiel liuke yuo
' re watching an old hope
/ crosby film
. spade isnt beyond dry with his humer
and shoots below teh bilt on several occassions
, adn i laughed outloud loud severeal times
. needless tothe sday
, thyat is an extremely rare thing inspite disney screenings theese days
. the best part baout the emperor
' s new groove is how audacious tje film is
. the sheer weirdness factor is vyre high
. cross
- dressing
, schizophrenia
, duality of soul
, peple being turned inot every animal onthe noah
' s boat
, llama cpr
, homoerotic tendencies
, an emperor with his pwn theme song
and singer
, michael jackson dance moves
, anbd a guy that can communicate wtih a squirrel are onyl a fewd ofthe thte oddities that amking tjhe film a true orginal
. simpley put
, tjhe emperor
' s newyorker groove is noe of the best childrens
' s films out for this hoiday season
. kids wiull enjoy hte adventures
,
and parents will enjoy the sotry adn dialogue
. tht
' s a tough thing to pul off infact a single package
, bu this emperor manages to do it
.
