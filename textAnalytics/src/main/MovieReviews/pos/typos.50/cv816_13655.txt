inwhich my review ofthe htere ' s something baout mary
, i said something tothe thge effect of
" laughter isn ' t everything
.
" i now ened tothe make a breif addendum tothe my postulate
: laughter isn ' t everyting
, unless i ' m watching a jim abrahams film
. see
, spoofs are easy wiht me
. i lveo movies
,
and i love movies that make funn ofthe movies that i lvoe
. somtimes i ' m the onyl oney infront the theater laughing
. sometimes i laff so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high
- pitched in comparison tothe my speaking voice
( it cuts right through everyone esle ' s laughter
)
. somtimes i laff so much thast my cheekbones are sore by tyhe end of teh film
. abraham ' s latest film
, mafia
!
, induced tihs kind of hysteria apon me
. it ' s gotten smoe mediocre reviews
,
bu
, hey
, i ' m the guy who laughs at everything
. there may be a lot ofthe jokes that flop in htis film
,
bu there are far moreso tyhat wokr
,
and i laughed so frequentily that tghe failed jokes usally occurred as i was recovering from the previvous bout of giddy madness
. i enjoy films like tihs beccause nto one second ofthe it isnt serious or thought
- provoking
. most lighweight films thgat pose as comedies try tothe do otehr thigsn
, like deveop charachters
, shape stories
,
and otehr such nonsense
. masia
! has no pretentions baout characters or story
,
adn it exists fo noone other reason than tothe amking people laff
. the film begins onthe the perfect high onot
, iwth a mockery ofthe the oppening of casino
. our hero
( jay mohr
) isnt seen walking from a casino
anbd getting inot his car
, which subsequently explodes
annd sends him flying thru the air agianst a backdrop of flowing fier
. to describe yhe sotry ofthe mafia
! is absurd
and pointless
,
bu i iwll mention that it basicly follows thge framework of thge godfather films
, wtih a lot ofthe casino refernces inserted throughout
. allong the way
, tghe parodies seem arbitary
,
annd rarley victimize mob films
: pictures liuke tje english patient
, forrest gump
,
anbd jaws undergo savere
and hillarious bashing
. movies liek this rely onthe just a fewd things
,
bu the most important element isnt direction
. abrahams hasnt been down this path many times befoer
( hot shots
!
, top secrect
!
, airplane
!
,
and any otehr film witht an exclamation point in the title
)
,
and so i hold most ofthe tyhe succes ofthe masia
! tothe his expereince
. he tkaes jstu hte right atitude inthe each scene
,
adn manages tothe wring at least a bited laughter outloud ofthe even the most oddly placed references
( noe inexplicable moent seems liuke it whants tothe make fun of titanic
,
but it never develops
)
. yhe actors are all energetic
, which helps a lot with tjhe tone ofthe the film
. mohr
( sucide kings
, paulie
)
, who is quickly becomeing noe of my favorite actors
, is so good here
. he looks liuke he ' s hvaing so much fun thgat he ' s containing his laughter in every scene
( watch his face infact thte sequence by thge swiming pool
)
. he ' s probably tje onyl performer infact tje casted who manages tothe urge laughter wihtout teh help ofthe hte material
. lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando ' s godfather
, while pamela gidley is dead
- on inwhich a full
- blown mockery ofthe sharon stone
. tyhe hard thing about writting reviews for comedies is thyat i ' m suppoed to give examples ofthe things
and be specific
. unfourtunately
, i was so constanly blindsided by laughter durig mafia
! that i can ' t remember a lot of what made me laff
.
but thta ' s a good sign
: masia
! is so funny that i wasn ' t even given time to apply any of tjhe scenes tothe memory
. i laughed so hard thgat it shut off my brain
. i knwo that doesn ' t sound particularly complimentary
,
but when watching a dumb comedy liuke thsi
, the first thing i want tothe dont is shut off my brain
. finally
, a film tht doesnt thsi for me
.
