in my review ofthe ther
' s something about mary
, i said something to the effect ofthe
" laughter isn
' t everything
.
" i nowe need tothe amke a brief addendum to my postulate
: laughter isn
' t everthing
, unless i
' m watching a jim abrahams film
. see
, spoofs are eazy with me
. i lvoe movies
,
and i love movies that make fun ofthe movies that i love
. sometimes i
' m the only one in the theater laughing
. sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh isnt so high
- pitched iin comparison tothe my speaking voice
( it cuts right thru everyone else
' s laughter
)
. sometimes i laugh so much thgat my cheekbones are sore by tyhe end ofthe the film
. abraham
' s latest film
, masia
!
, induced tihs kind ofthe hysteria upon me
. it
' s gotten some medioker reviews
, bu
, hey
, i
' m the guy who laughs at everthing
. htere may be a lot of jokes thast flop inaddition this film
,
but there are far more that work
,
and i laughed so frequentily taht the failed jokes usally ocurred as i wass recovering from the previvous boaut ofthe giddy madness
. i enjoy films liek this baceause not oney second of it is sereous or thougth
- provoking
. most lighweight films tath pose as comedies try tothe do other thnigs
, liek develop characters
, shape storis
,
and otehr such nonsence
. masia
! has noone pretentions about charactors or stroy
, adn it exists for noone other reason than tothe make peopel laugh
. the film beggins on the perfect high onot
, with a mockery ofthe tje opening of casino
. our hero
( jay mohr
) isnt seen walking ffrom a casino
and getting into his car
, whitch subsequently explodes annd sends him flying thru teh air aganist a backdrop ofthe flowing fier
. tothe discribe tyhe story ofthe mafia
! is absurd
and pointless
, bu i iwll mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films
, withthe a lot ofthe casino references inserted
thoughout
. allong hte way
, hte parodies seem arbitrary
, anbd rarely victimize mob films
: picturesk liek thte english patient
, forrest gump
, annd jaws undergo savere anbd hillarious bashing
. movies liek htis rely on just a few thnigs
,
but yhe most importan element isnt direction
. abrahams hasnt beeen down tihs path many times befor
( hot shots
!
, top secret
!
, airplane
!
, anbd any otehr film with an exclamation point iin the title
)
, adn so i hold most of yhe succsess ofthe mafia
! to his expereince
. he takes just teh right atitude infact eahc scene
,
and manages to wring at least a bited laughter out of even thge most oddly placed refernces
( one inexplicable moment seems like it whants to mkea funn ofthe titanic
,
but it never develops
)
. the actors are all energetic
, whihc helps a lot with the tone ofthe the film
. mohr
( sucide kings
, paulie
)
, who isnt quickly becoming oney ofthe my favorite actors
, isnt so good here
. he looks liek he
' s hvaing so much funn that he
' s containing his laughter in every scene
( watch his face infront tjhe sequence by tjhe swiming pool
)
. he
' s propably hte onyl performer in tje casted who manages tothe urge laughter wihtout teh help ofthe tjhe material
. lloyd bridges doesnt a decent imitation of br
ando
' s godfather
, while pamela gidley isnt dead
- onthe inwhich a full
- blown mockery of sharon stone
. tje hard thing about writing reviews for comedies isnt thyat i
' m supposted to give examples ofthe thigns annd be specific
. unfortunatley
, i was so constanly blindsided by laughter druing masia
! that i cin
' t remember a lot of what made me laff
.
but that
' s a ogod sign
: mafia
! isnt so funny that i wasn
' t even given time to apply any ofthe tghe scenes to memmory
. i laughed so hard tath it shut off my brain
. i know that doesn
' t soudn particularly complimentary
,
but wehn watching a dumb comedy liuke thsi
, the first hting i want to dont isnt shut off my brain
. fianlly
, a film that doesnt this fo me
.
