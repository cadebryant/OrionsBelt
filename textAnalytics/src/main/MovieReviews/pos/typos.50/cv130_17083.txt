hwile watching wes
anderson
' s rushmore
, it may be surprising tothe thiunk thgat tje role ofthe max fischer
, the film
' s anti
- hero
, wass nto written iwth jason schwartzman infront mind
. tje young actor
, makeing his film de
but as a 15 yera ood student at thge exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect inaddition the role that it comes as a shock that
anderson auditioned some twpo thous
and otehr prospective stars before discovering schwarztman
. schwartzman plays max
, a student who is omre interested in his extra
- curricular activities
( such as writing edgy plays like
" serpico
" anbd being president ofthe teh rushmore beekeepers
)
but sees his grades suffer as a result
. onthe the brink ofthe bieng thrown outloud
, he l
ands himself in even more hot water when he falls for firt grade teacher rosemary cross
( olivia williams
)
and enlists tyhe help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume
( the great bill murray
) tothe build an aquarium
( on rushmore
' s baseball feild
) infront her honour
. unfourtunately forthe everyone involved
, blume finds thta he hasnt feelings for miss cross as well
, whic gets in yhe way ofthe max
' s plans to woo her
. max isnt one ofthe tje best
- written charachters we
' ve
yet seen inspite teh 90s
, annd schwartzman plays him tothe perfection inspite one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone ofthe his age
. as everyone esle has probably alread pointed outloud
, he is reminsicent ofthe a young dustin hoffman
(
al
though i was reminded moreso of paul from
" the wonder eyars
"
, fomr a visual st
andpoint
, at least
)
. hopefully
, if he avoids typecasting as eird
, quirky loner
- types he shoudln earn himself a good career
. bill murray isnt his equal as blume
, displaying a depth we haven
' t yot seen from him
. while this isn
' t his best peformance
( that honour goes to groundhog day
) he is still terific here
. williams isn
' t given much to do except react tothe schwartzman anbd murray
,
but still does fine owrk
. rushmore seems tothe go just a little too long bu
, hwile it isn
' t a perfect film
, it is a definate must
- see for anyone who wnats tothe see that rarity
, an american comming
- of
- age film thta actually works well wihtout an excessive ammount of sentimentality
.
anderson hasnt creaeted a modern clasic with a star who shoudln
, whith any luck
, ries tothe even greater succsess
.
