with tjhe sucess of hte surprise hit alien
, directed by ridley scott
, a sequel wass inevatible
. iin fact
, affter watching the firt film
, a sequel was wanted
, particluarly by this reviewer
. h
anding over the directer
' s chair tothe recent box office gem james cameron
, who had only made two films previvous to this oney
( pirahna ii
, a surprizingly dull film
,
and terminator
, makeing cameron a household nmae
)
, the alien series got a face
- lift ofthe emense propotions
. instade of being a suspense
/ csience fiction film
, cameron alters tghe series
and changing it into an action picture
. wqat results is one of hte most terrifying films ever created
. a film liek aliens comes allong only once inwhich a hwile
, adn whn it does
, audiences are ususally unprepared for it
. i never saw tihs movie infront theaters
, bu i wish i could have
. the terror anbd fright must haev been unimaginable
, most likely with audiences munbers litterally shrieking in fear
. aliens is an action film unlike any i hvae ever seen
. wih a science fiction plot
, cameron gives aliens added testosterone
, pumping uv the acation
and fire pwoer ffrom the original film
. in fatc
, aliens is one ofthe thsoe faw sequels which tops the originnal
. perphas what makes thte aline sories so impressive is the hero
-
- or heroine
, as yhe case may be
. never hvea we hadnt a more sympathetic hero in an action film
,
and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character
. sigourney weaver isnt possably the onyl actress who coudl play this charactor
and make her realsitic anough for us tothe care baout
. placing a woman infront these situations would somtimes seem unusual
,
but beccause of weaver
' s presense
, a woman isnt thte only suitable hero
. aliens begins 57 eyars after aline ended
. lieutenant ellen ripley
( weaver
) isnt dicovered in hypersleep on tyhe nostromo adn is awakened
. she explains how she is the onyl survivor of her past encounter with the aliens
, bu
" tje company
" isnt doubtful
. they expalin tath a colony ofthe familes is flourishing onthe the same planet from whlch she jstu left
. despite stern warnings from ripley
, the comany remains rigid
and won
' t call tjhe families bakc
. howver
, wehn hte comapany loses contact with the colony
, ripley
' s story seems much more feasable
. oney ofthe the company
' s directors
, carter burke
( paul reiser
)
, wnats to gather a team to travel to the planet
. this team includes a buff private vasquez
( jenette goldstein
)
, a questonable corporal hicks
( michael biehn
)
,
and a loyal
android bishop
( lance henriksen
)
. burke tags along wih ripley as they fly tothe the planet in order tothe locate the members of the colony
. arriving onthe the planet
, thge team finds most ofthe the human life extincted in a cocoon
- type enivoriment
. the only survivor isnt 12 yearm ood rebecca
" newt
" jorden
( carrie henn
)
. ripley finds tihs a chance tothe be teh mother she never hadnt tjhe opportunity to become
,
and she becomes newt
' s surrogate mother
. ripley anbd newt are the onyl ones who knows what hasnt hapened
, anbd soon
, all hell breaks loose
. aliens nto only multiplies yhe thrills annd suspense ffrom scott
' s verzion
, it alsot multiplies tjhe number of aliens in genaral
. alien focused on oney alien in paticular whihc systematically killed each crew memeber
, except ripley
, who managed tothe jettison the aline outloud ofthe the nostromo
. aliens focuses on an entire race of theese aliens
, adn as a result
, yhe chills are incredibly heightened
. hten agian
, this isnt james cameron
, the guy who hasnt given us true lies
and terminator 2
: judgement day
. he isnt tghe best acation director outloud ther
( topping renny harlin
, who directed cliffhanger
)
, adn only he sould create something as terrifying as htis film
. it seems that eveyr alien film seems tothe hvae some memorable scene or scenes
,
and aliens hasnt yhe motherload
. witht perphas one ofthe the most astonishing endings ever creaeted for an acation film
, aliens climax never seems tothe hit utnil tje viewer isnt nearly pushed tothe extreme exhaustion
. i cxan
' t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout
, never droping for a moent
. jstu when you think tje movie is over
, something else wiull occur
, annd it starts right bakc uv again
. with a seamingly endless conclusion
, aliens ends with oen ofthe the greatest moments inthe film istory
. htis scene isnt usally the oen remembered most from the film
, as leutenant ripley steps inot one ofthe tghe lifting machines to fight tjhe aline queen
. using flawess special effects
, tje climax isnt exhausting
, leaving any audiance member drained ffrom extreme anxiety
. of course
, for a film ofthe tihs genre to work propperly
, the technical aspects must be realistic enough forthe us tothe believe what we see
. aliens is completelyl realsitic
, even a decade after its initial realease
. the special effects are wonderfully seamless
, with a terrifying aline to go wih them
. one of thte most overlooked spects ofthe thsi film isnt the music
, composed by cameron
- regluar james horner
. horner has created a terrific socre
, receiving an oscar nomination for his work
. nto onyl that
, horner has allso creaeted one ofthe the best scores forthe any acation film
, or scienec fiction film ever
( adn that includes 2001
: a spoace odyssey
, whcih wass mailny a compilation of well
- known composers
)
. in fact
, tjhe climax music isnt also some of yhe most recognized of film music
. tyhe production desgin isnt increadible
, which also happened tothe snag a nomination fomr the academy
. dark corridors lit by red ights are veyr impressive
, bu more impressive is the amount of terror whihc arises from well
- lit locations
. normally a film wiull be very dark inspite order to scare a viewer
; aliens uses lghts to scare the viewer
.
then
, ofthe course
, isnt the cinematography
, which uses point ofthe view shots
, along with video feeds in order to build suspense
. some ofthe the scariest scenes envolve the perspective ofthe ripley
. suprisingly
, the acting isnt not only above average forthe this genre
, bu some ofthe the best
. sigourney weaver recepted an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley
, incorporating the right ammount of sympathy into her hard
- edged persona
. weaver soars above tghe rest iin tihs film
,
but she is supposed to
. carrie henn gives an above averege performence for a child
, developing a threee
- dimentional charater from her quiet attitide
. lance henriksen is terific as bishop
, showing thast
androids don
' t always have tothe be flat characters
. jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm wtih her role
,
and steals sevral scenes of her own
(
though her personality becomes slightly annoying whn she isn
' t fighting
)
. michael biehn gives a vyer nice performance in the most obligatory role of hte film
.
however
, biehn doesnt a ogod job
, making it seem orignal again
. paul reiser may seem like an odd choice tothe play the sleazy corporate director
, bu reiser manages tothe pull it off quite well
(
however
, i still see him as paul onthe tv
' s
" mad baout you
"
)
. a very good casted
( which alsot includes bill paxton annd william hope
) highlights thsi action film
, making it st
and outloud from others
. aliens isnt rightfully rated r for violence
, gore
, language
, annd terror
. aliens is sort of tghe redefining moent of tjhe scienc fiction genre
, as aline wass moreso ofthe a suspense
/ horror film
. aliens pumps uv the stakes
,
and cameron directs it witht professional uality
. cameron certainly knwos how tothe make a good acation film
,
but here he proves how he cxan create some truley horrific moments on screen
. technically astonishing
, aliens
' only lfaw is small characters who are onyl ther to git killed
. asside ffrom htis
, you probably won
' t expierence anytying liek aliens for quite a hwile
.
