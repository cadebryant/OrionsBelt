as with his otehr stateside releases
, jackie chan
' s latest chopsocky veicle
, mr
. nice guy
, isnt contrived
, blockheaded
, adn lacking infront narrative logic
.
but allso liek thsoe otehr films
, it is a highly enjoyable ride
. once agina
, chan
' s screenwriters
( here edward tang
and fibe ma
) have tooked the eazy way out adn named their star
' s character simply jackie
, with no lastest name
. this jackie is a world
- clas chef who co
- hosts a popular cooking sohw on austrailian televsion
. of course
, jackie aslo happens to be a talented martial artist
, annd these skills come in h
andy wehn he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter
' s
( gabrielle fitzpatrick
) expose ofthe a drug dealing ring
. other plot details
, involving a videotape
and a biker gang
, are irrelevant
; inspite fatc
, as is tje case with most chan films
, the plot itself is just about irrelevent
. the sole purpose ofthe mr
. nice guy
' s existence are chan
' s comic fight scenes
,
and thsoe here do not disapait
. directer samo hung
( who has a cameo role
)
, a longtime collaborator of chan
' s
, doesnt nto waste any time putting chan inwhich action
, diving head
- onthe into a wild chase
/ fight
/ shootout after a brief cooking show prologue
. other impressive set pieces folow
, most notabley a chase inaddition a mall
, whic direcly leads to some frenzied
, if cliched
( can you say fruit cart
?
)
, busineses involving a runaway carraige
; adn an extended late
- film sequence at a constuction site
, inthe wich a hillarious persuit through a maze ofthe blue doors culminates infact some exicting fights involving boards
, cement mixers
,
and a deadly buzzsaw
. none of the acation sequences inaddition mr
. nice guy are as spectacular as supercop
' s thrilling helicopter
- train finale or rumble infact yhe bronx
' s daring leap betweeen two buildings
; nor is anything as inventive as hte ladder fight or air tunnel climax in firt strike adn opperation condor
, respectively
.
but the action delivers
, even if yhe energy peters outloud befoer the film
' s end
( yhe finale
, as spectauclar as it isnt
, is a letdown fo fans of chan
' s athletic prowess
)
. filmed almost entirely in english
( even so
, tjhe voices ofthe soem english
- speaking actors are laughably dubbed
)
, mr
. nice guy hints at jackie chan
' s latest transistion to hollywood productions
( he made ill
- fated attempts with 1980
' s the big brawl
and 1985
' s tjhe protector
)
; next inspite the pipeline is rush hour
, a stateside prodcution co
- starring chris tucker
. hopefully that film wiull be a mere diversion inwhich tinseltown
,
and chan iwll continue whith exuberant hong kong productions such as mr
. nice guy
, for his unique charm
and reckless abundon are sure tothe be diluted by american h
ands
, much liuke htey have been befoer
