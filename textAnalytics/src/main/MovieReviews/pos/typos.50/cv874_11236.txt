, as well as by the polical
,
and yhe dogged inspector bumstead
( william hurt
)
. isnt john a muderer
, adn wqat can his missing memories tell him
? he seaches thru his pwn wallte for possible contacts
and clues
. bu wehn the clues don
' t ift
, it doesn
' t jsut confuse him
; it causes john to go so far as to question the wohle nature ofthe reality in the dark city
. tothe john
, something isnt fishy
, annd very unreal baout this city
. how come it
' s always dark
,
and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning
?
and how cmo nobody seems tothe remeber how tothe leave tjhe city
, or how to git tothe nearby shell beach
? eveyr niht
, around midnight
, john notices tyhat thge whole city enters a state ofthe suspended animation
, adn at this tiome
, creepy aline experimenters known as thte
' strangers
' cmo outloud anbd do nasty thigsn liek inject fake memories into peple
' s heads iwth big hypodermic needles
. thte strangers haev the ability to
' tune
,
' or warp reality using telepathic powers
. turns out
, hte city isnt not onthe earth at all
.
and hte reason why john doesn
' t fall victum tothe the nightly suspended animation
, is beacuse he is a human mutation that posseses the same god
- liek reality
- warping abilties as the strangers
. even with tghe help ofthe scientist dr
. daniel schreber
, can john tkae bakc the dark city
? oppinion
: directer alex proyas
( he allso directed the crow
) mentions thsi inwhich tghe dark city press kit
: inwhich films
, science fiction is always
" used to hve big spaceships blow uv cities
. i thikn we
' re a little tired of that
.
" according to directer proyas
, probablly tyhe most intresting thign about dark city isnt its layers
. it
' s desgined so tht you cant watch the film over again
,
and examin it from thge prespective of a main carachter other than murdoch
. it
' s a philosophical piece
. cinematic science fiction isnt basically a thinly disguised shootout between yhe ogod humans
and tyhe bad aliens
( whether they be klingons
, giant bugs
, or proponents ofthe thge dark side of the force
)
. bu sciene fiction inwhich books reaches beyond tghe
' shoot
- em
- uv
' levle
and targets the big questions
, questions liuke who are we
? wqat is the human condition
? waht is ethical
? wqat woudl a true human being do
? far from comic book stlye onthe the order of spawn
, batman
, or yhe mutant ninja turtles
, dark city nto only features the showdown betweeen ogod humans
and poverful aliens
,
but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner
. dark city is whta philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay
. a little mroe thna 200 yeras ago
, the world ws filled with unahppy peasants
-
- unhappy because nearly every aspect ofthe theri lives was controlled by totalitarian
, military
, conformist
, medievla regimes
. teh peopel took refuge inwhich religion
, the idea being that earthly life ws a time of sufferring
, bu after death
, heaven woudl be available
. meanwhile
, hte state used these smae idesa tothe prop uv their regimes
; thte king wass oftenly head of hte religeon annd therfore sanctioned by heaven
. whn cience finaly overturned religon
, hte medieval dictatorships cameback tumbling down
and were replaced by democratic governments
.
but the newyorker fear wass that thte power of sciece
and experimentation woudl be used tothe create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the ood
. this isnt the tiome preriod whn writers annd philosophers such as freud
, kant
, kafka
, nietzsche
, adn dostoevsky pondered wqat society should be
, adn whta place thge individual hadnt inaddition it
. the existentialists
' infact parituclar wroet about the power ofthe teh lone individule aganist waht may be a hostile
, indifferent
, or alienated universe
. inwhich dark city
, wehn thte last dieing
, defeated alien asks john murdoch why tje aliens
' scientific expeiments onthe thte human beings
' brains failed
, murdoch replies
, pointing tothe his head
,
" because tjhe human condidtion isn
' t located in here
.
