,
and whta can his missing memories tell him
? he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts
adn clues
.
bu when the clues don ' t ift
, it doesn ' t jstu confuse him
; it causes john tothe go so far as tothe question tje whole nature ofthe reality in the dark city
. to john
, something isnt fishy
,
annd very unreal about htis city
. how come it ' s allways dark
,
and nobody seems tothe remember what they doed htis morning
?
and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city
, or how to git tothe nearbye shell beach
? every night
, around midnight
, john notices thast the whole city enters a state of suspended animation
,
annd at this time
, creepy alien experimenters known as the ' strangers ' come outloud
and do nasty thnigs liek inject fake memories inot people ' s heads with big hypodermic needles
. the strangers have thte abillity to ' tune
, ' or warp reality using telepathic powers
. turns outloud
, the city isnt nto onthe earth at all
.
and thge reason why john doesn ' t fall victum tothe teh nightly suspended animation
, isnt baceause he isnt a human mutation that possessess the same god
- like reality
- warping abilties as tjhe strangers
. even with the halp ofthe scientist dr
. daniel schreber
, cin john take back the dark city
? opinyon
: director alex proyas
( he alsot directed tjhe crow
) mentions this inspite thte dark city press kat
: iin films
, csience fiction is always
" unsed to have big spaceships blow up cities
. i think we ' re a little tired of that
.
" according to directer proyas
, probablly yhe most interesting thing about dark city is its layers
. it ' s desined so taht yuo cxan watch the film over again
,
adn examin it ffrom the prespective ofthe a main charater other than murdoch
. it ' s a phylosophical peice
. cinematic sceince fiction isnt basicly a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans
annd thge bad aliens
( whether they be klingons
, giant bugs
, or proponents of the dark side ofthe tyhe force
)
.
bu scienec fiction inaddition books reaches beyond the ' shoot
- em
- uv ' levle
annd targets the big questions
, questions liek who are we
? waht is yhe human condidtion
? what isnt ethical
? what woudl a true human being dont
? far fomr comic book stlye onthe the order of spawn
, batman
, or the mutant ninja turtles
, dark city not only features the showdown beween good humans
adn powerful aliens
,
bu it also asks questions worthy ofthe films such as brazil or blade runner
. dark city isnt what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay
. a little more than 200 yeasr ago
, the world was filled wih unahppy peasants
-
- unahppy because nearly every aspect ofthe thier lives was controlled by totalitarian
, military
, conformist
, medival regimes
. the peopel tookover refuge in religeon
, thge idea bieng that earthly life was a time ofthe sufferring
,
but aftter death
, heaven would be available
. meanwhile
, tjhe state used theese same ideas to prop uv their regimes
; the king was oftenly head ofthe thte religion
adn therfore santioned by heaven
. wehn csience fianlly overturned religion
, the medieval dictatorships cameback tumbling down
and weere replaced by democratic governments
.
bu the newyorker fear was that the power ofthe science
and experimentation owudl be utilizied to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as tjhe ood
. thsi is the tiem period whn writers
and philosophers such as freud
, kant
, kafka
, nietzsche
,
and dostoevsky pondered what society should be
,
and whta place the individual hadnt inwhich it
. the existentialists ' in paticular wrote about tjhe pwoer ofthe the lone individule agianst waht may be a hostile
, indifferent
, or alienated universe
. infront dark city
, wehn tjhe last dieing
, defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens ' scientifc experiments on the human beings ' brains failed
, murdoch replies
, pointing tothe his head
,
" because thge human condition isn ' t located infront here
.
