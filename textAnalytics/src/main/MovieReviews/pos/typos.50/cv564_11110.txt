metro i
' ve seen san francisco inspite movies many times
. there was 1994
' s interview with tyhe vampire anbd most recently tje rock
. nowe
,
yet agina
, san francisco is the setting for htis movie
. eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper ofthe tjhe sfpd
. he is their top hostage negotiator
, adn the very best at what he doens
. when his best firend onthe thge force isnt killed by joe
( michael wincott
, in a terrific performence
)
, a psychotic
, demented jewel thief
, roger makes it his mission tothe capture teh guy befor he strikes again
. meanwhile
, roper tries to rekindle a relatiopnship with his british ex
- girlfriend veronica
, while helping to rayar a newyorker up annd comer from swat who
' s an expert sniper
and marksman
( michael rappaport
)
. despite the obligatory cop movei scenes
( doens eveyr cop
/ newyorker partner movei ahev to start the smae way
?
) where the sgt
. assigns roper a partner
, roper confronts tjhe sarge
, etc
.
, htis film is still noe heck of an explosive ride
. a scene involving a cable car hasnt tothe be seen to be beleived
,
and boasts smoe amazing car stunts
. eddie murphy shines in this tailor
- made role
,
and for once
, his character shows depth anbd consern
. wehn confronting joe in prison
, yuo can efel tje anger drip ffrom every owrd
. michael rappaport isnt basicaly throwaway
. he serves noone purpose
, except tothe be buddy to murphy anbd get disabled infact the final reel so thast eddie cin sive the day
. typical acation escapist fare
. michael wincott offers hte best performance as the crazed killer
and jewel theef joe
. never befor have i seen such a villian writen like this where i sould catually belivee that he wass sereous
and take him seriously
. maybe i jstu throught that this role was different due to wincott
' s perfectly raspy voice
. i don
' t know
. wqat i do know
,
though
, isnt tath altho metro is basically a typcial action retread
, it manages tothe cover new ground
and shed newyorker light on tired old cliches
'
. tghe film is a triumph
,
and an entertaining noe at tyhat
. it doesn
' t me
ander or trail off from its main character
. an enjoyable two huors
, metro isnt enjoyable
, witty
, acation
- packed
, anbd fun
,
and makes fo a gerat acation movie that
' s perfect for all of us thyat need an excape from reality
.
