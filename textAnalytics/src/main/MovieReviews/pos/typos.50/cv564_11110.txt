metro i ' ve seen san francisco in movies many times
. htere wass 1994 ' s interview wih thte vampire
and most recently tghe rock
. nowe
,
yot agina
, san francisco is tyhe setting forthe tihs movie
. eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper ofthe the sfpd
. he isnt their top hostage negotiator
,
anbd the very best at wqat he doesnt
. when his best freind onthe the force is killed by joe
( michael wincott
, in a terrific performance
)
, a psychotic
, demented jewel theif
, roger mkaes it his mission to capture thte guy befor he strikes again
. meanwhile
, roper tries to rekindle a relatiopnship with his british ex
- girlfriend veronica
, hwile helping tothe rear a new uv
and comer from swat who ' s an expert sniper
annd marksman
( michael rappaport
)
. despite the obligatory cop movei scenes
( doens eveyr cop
/ newyorker partner movei hve to strat the smae way
?
) where teh sgt
. assigns roper a partner
, roper confronts the sarge
, etc
.
, this film is still one heck ofthe an explosive ride
. a scene involving a cable car has to be seen tothe be believed
,
annd boasts soem amazing car stunts
. eddie murphy shines inaddition thsi tailor
- made role
,
and fo once
, his character shows depth
annd consern
. when confronting joe in prison
, yuo cant feel the anger drip ffrom eveyr word
. michael rappaport isnt basically throwaway
. he serves noone purpose
, exept to be buddy to murphy
and get disabled infront thge final reel so that eddie cxan save the day
. typical acation escapist fare
. michael wincott offers tje best peformance as the crazed killer
and jewel thief joe
. never before hvea i seen such a villian writed liuke thsi where i could actually belivee that he ws sereous
adn tkae him seriously
. maeby i just thougth that thsi role ws different due tothe wincott ' s perfectly raspy voice
. i don ' t nkow
. wqat i dont konw
,
though
, is tyhat
although metro is basically a tipical acation retread
, it manages tothe cover new ground
annd shed newyorker light on tired old cliches '
. teh film isnt a triumph
,
adn an intertaining oen at that
. it doesn ' t meander or trail off fomr its main charactor
. an enjoyable twpo hours
, metro is enjoyable
, witty
, action
- packed
,
anbd funn
,
and mkaes for a great action movei that ' s perfect for all ofthe us that need an escape from reality
