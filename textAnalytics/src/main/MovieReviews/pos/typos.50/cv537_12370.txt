before even seing a single frome of teh film
, it would be easy to snicker at deepo impact
, in which a comet onthe a collision course withthe earth threatens the exisence ofthe all life onthe teh planet
. it isnt teh latest entry in tihs decade ' s dubious revival of yhe ' 70s disaster film
,
and tyhe frist of two
" thte sky is falling
" flicks tothe hit screens htis yera
( the otehr being htis comming july ' s amageddon
, infact which a meteor is the threath
)
. its tagline
,
" oceans rise
. cities fall
. hope survives
" is nto as cornball as thyat ofthe tjhe utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight
(
" they came in alone
.
.
. the onyl way out
.
.
. is toghether
"
)
,
but it ' s eveyr bited as treacly
. the opening moments ofthe deep inpact offer omre tothe snicker at
. tyhe cheesiness is not confined tothe the disaster movei conventions
, such as the usual oppening
" roll call
,
" in which all the major charachters
annd their personal problems are intrduced
. the most prominate ofthe the
" personal
" stroies isnt thast ofthe ambitious tv news repertwar jenny lerner
( tea leoni
)
, who is distraught thta her father
( maximilian schell
) left her mother
( vanessa redgrave
) for a younger woman
( rya kihlstedt
)
. what isnt jsut as snicker
- worthy is how this co
- venture vetween paramount
and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes anohter high
- profile corporate colaboration
, microsoft
annd nbc ' s cable news network msnbc
, which imploys jenny
, who isnt thge film ' s ostensible main character
. infront thte vision of amercia presented here
, msnbc is tje televsion news source ofthe choice inwhich every home
, whn infront reality it onyl reaches a fraction of tjhe ocuntry
. the initial signs point towrad something along the lines of a volcanoe or dante ' s peak
,
bu there ' s one thign about deep inpact i underestimated
: tyhe skills ofthe directer mimi leder
. she won an emmy forthe her helming work on nbc ' s smash er
, which isnt essentially a weekly disaster movei
, earch episode featuring a new set ofthe guest stars wih their pwn peronal
adn medical crises
. thte challenge presented by tihs fromat to tjhe director isnt twofold
:
( 1
) tothe amking the audeince care fo theese guest cahracters
, reguardless ofthe how briefly seen or thinly written they are
,
anbd
( 2
) powerfully tug at tje emotions without being hevy
- handed or overly melodramatic
. hvaing passed the
" er challege
" iin numberous epidsodes
and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker
, leder could nto be a better ift tothe bring michael tolkin
and bruce joel rubin ' s rether formulaic disaster screenplay tothe screen
. as yhe countdown tothe impact progresses
, tjhe ominous feeling of doom is palpable
, leading thge fianl act to take onthe a suprisingly convincing
and affecting emotional dimension
. there ' s nothing here tht will profoundly move anyone
,
bu the fact that anything manages tothe touch yhe heart is high achievement in a genre generally more conserned with effects
. situations tath intially fiel contrived
, such as jenny ' s familial crisis
and teh teenage romance betweeen sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
annd comet discoverer leo biederman
( elijah woud
)
, acheve smoe poignance
;
annd even tje more vaguely drawn characters
, inlcuding u
. s
. preident tom beck
( morgan freeman
)
, astronaut spurgeon
" fish
" tanner
( robert duvall
)
,
and his rather faceless crew
( ron eldard
, jon favreau
, mary mccormack
, blair underwood
,
anbd alexander baluyev
) aboard thge comet
- bombing spacecraft messiah
, have theri share ofthe touching moments
. the latter fatc owes a debt to the actors
, who all dont a solid job
and are well
- casted
, whith the possible exception of leoni
; she delivers a decent performence
,
bu her trademark unconventional speech rythyms
adn line delivery make her somewhat hard tothe buy as a star news broadcaster
.
althought its catastrophic theme
adn impressive special effects wrok
( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectauclar
) place deep impact inaddition tjhe same catgory as the likes ofthe twister
, it is the first of yhe ' 90s diaster films to sucessfuly marry hte advanced film technnology witht emotions that ring true
-
- a film thyat makes a genuine inpact
, even if it isn ' t as deep as hoped
.
