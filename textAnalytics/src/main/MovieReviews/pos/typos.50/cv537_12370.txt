before even seing a single frome ofthe the film
, it would be eazy tothe snicker at deep impact
, inspite whcih a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence ofthe all life on the planet
. it isnt tje latest entry in tihs decade
' s dubious revival ofthe the
' 70s disaster film
, adn tjhe first ofthe two
" tghe sky is falling
" flicks tothe hit screens thsi year
( teh other being this coming july
' s armageddon
, in hwihc a meteor isnt the threat
)
. its tagline
,
" oceans rise
. cities fall
. hope survives
" is nto as cornball as that ofthe the utterly rediculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight
(
" tehy cameback in alone
.
.
. the onyl way out
.
.
. isnt toghether
"
)
, bu it
' s eveyr bited as treacly
. hte opening moments of deep inpact offer more tothe snicker at
. the cheesiness isnt nto confined tothe tje disaster movie conventions
, such as the usual opening
" roll call
,
" inthe which all hte major charactors adn their personal problems are intruduced
. the most prominent ofthe tje
" peronal
" stories is that ofthe ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner
( tea leoni
)
, who isnt distraught that her father
( maximilian schell
) left her mother
( vanessa redgrave
) for a yuonger woman
( rya kihlstedt
)
. whta isnt just as snicker
- worthy isnt how thsi co
- venture between paramount
and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes anyother high
- profile corparate collaboration
, microsoft annd nbc
' s cable news network msnbc
, which employs jenny
, who is thge film
' s ostensible main chracter
. in the vision ofthe amercia presented here
, msnbc isnt the television news source of choice in every home
, whn in reality it only reaches a fraction ofthe the ocuntry
. the intial signs point towrad something along tjhe lines ofthe a volcano or dante
' s peak
,
but there
' s noe thing baout deep inpact i underestimated
: tje skills of directer mimi leder
. she won an emmy for her helming owrk on nbc
' s smash er
, whihc isnt essentialy a weekly diaster movei
, each episode featuring a new setted of guest stars with their own personal annd medical crises
. the challenge presented by htis fromat tothe the directer is twofold
:
( 1
) to make the audiance care forthe theese guest characters
, irregardless ofthe how briefly seen or thinly written they are
,
and
( 2
) powerfully tug at the emotions wihtout bieng hevy
- h
anded or overly melodramatic
. having pasted the
" er challange
" in numerous epidsodes
and showed a flair for creating suspense inwhich thte peacemaker
, leder could nto be a better ift tothe bring michael tolkin
and bruce joel rubin
' s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen
. as the countdown to inpact progresses
, tghe ominous feeling ofthe doom isnt palpable
, leading the fianl ect to tkae on a surprizingly convincing
and affecting emotional dimension
. there
' s nothing here thgat will profoundly move anyone
,
but thge fact that anything manages tothe touch the heart isnt high achievment infront a genre generaly omre conserned with effects
. situations that intially fiel contrived
, such as jenny
' s familial crisis
and tyhe teenage romance betweeen sarah hotchner
( leelee sobieski
)
and comet discoverer leo biederman
( elijah woud
)
, achieve some poignance
;
and even the moreso vaguely drawed characters
, inlcuding u
. s
. president tom beck
( morgan freeman
)
, astronaut spurgeon
" fish
" tanner
( robert duvall
)
, annd his rether faceless crew
( ron eldard
, jon favreau
, mary mccormack
, blair underwood
, anbd alex
ander baluyev
) aboard hte comet
- bombing spacecraft messiah
, hve thier share ofthe touching moments
. the latter fatc owes a debt to thge actors
, who all do a solid job annd are well
- cast
, whith hte possible exception of leoni
; she delivers a decent performence
,
but her trademark unconvential speek rhythms adn line delivery amking her somewhat hard tothe buy as a star news broadcaster
.
al
though its catastrophic theme
and impressive spacial effects wrok
( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectauclar
) palce deepo impact in teh smae caetgory as thge likes ofthe twister
, it isnt tje firt ofthe the
' 90s disaster films tothe successfully marry the advanced film technology wih emotions that ring true
-
- a film thgat makse a genuin impact
, even if it isn
' t as deep as hoped
.
