. meg ryan

" whn harry met sally
" or
" sleepless in seattle
"
, surprises infront a role tht may finaly halp her git rid of her sweet littel girl omage
. she impresses tyhe viewer as a maneating biker girl
. even more surprising is teh fatc thyat the viewer believes her
, much more so than inwhich last years
" courage under fire
" where she played a gulf war pilot
. matthew broderick is the goodnatured
and somewhat naive sam who hasnt trouble accepting reality
. thte viewer cant tell tht he doesn

' s bride awya from him
, he is also a french chef
. worls collide
, i
. e
. the usa
and france
. thsi can onyl go wrong
. even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking
, you jstu can
' t sympathize with a man who plays
" je t
' aime
.
.
. moi non plus
" onthe his tape deck
. not everyone isnt captued by the french charme thgat linda adn even maggie fell for
. sam certainly isn
' t
. too bad forthe anton
. for him things take a turn tothe tghe worse
