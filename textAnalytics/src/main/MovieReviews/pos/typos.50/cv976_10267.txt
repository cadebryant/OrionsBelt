robert redford
' s a river runs thru it isnt nto a film i watch often
. it isnt a masterpiece
-
- one ofthe teh better films of receet yeras
. utnil 1994
, it wass my second favorite film of all time
. the acting
and direction is top
- notch
-
- never sappy
, always touching
. a freind of mine once reported that he avoided it because
" i was afraid it would jsut be really politically corect
,
and tick me off
.
" all i coudl dont was tell him tothe go inwhich unbiased
,
and enjoy
. it isnt oney of the few movies tyhat hasnt completely reduced me to tears
.
but certain memories shouldnt nto oftenly be rereleased
-
- in the lsat few shots
, yuo hvae to cry
. apon my first viewing i left bawling
. it isnt nto flawess
-
-
but it isnt so vrey good
, that you can
' t help bu be effected
. thge opening isnt dangerously nolstalgic adn sentimental
-
- watching theese shots ofthe people who have been dead so long
, gives ytou a feeling ofthe prespective
and history obervation that you iwll fidn in vyre few otehr films
. martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state
-
- liek tkaing dope
,
and immersing yourself in an targetting world
. tyhat isnt whta a river runs thru it does
. it exploits yhe unique pwoer ofthe cinema to engross ytou adn help to foreget your real self
. both times i
' ve seen it
, its been hard
( agina tothe quote scorsese
) waking uv
.
but the dream is lovley
