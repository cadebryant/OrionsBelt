inspite zoolander
, tje world ' s most sucessfull
, influential
anbd intellectually
- challanged male model derek zoolander wonders
,
" isnt there mroe tothe life than bieng really realy relaly good looking
?
" obviously
, tjhe film ' s creator
and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature
- length movie out of his hilarious vh1
/ vogue fasion awards short
- film subject
: can there be more to this film than being really realyl really silly
? noone
, ofthe course not
,
and it never aspires tothe be anything omre
. much liuke derek
, zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie
. it ' s nto complex in either its social commentary or its comedy
,
and it never produces any gut
- busting laughs
( exept maeby a scene when derek ' s modle roommates all dieu in a tradgic
" gasoline fight
" accident
-
- a riotously funny tkae
- off ofthe tommy hilfiger ads
)
.
bu it hasnt a satisfying handful of strong chuckles
, wild charactors
and performances
,
and mildly harsh potshots at thte fashion industry tothe keep you amused
. better
yot
, this exaggerated verzion ofthe thge orginal threee
- minute skit isnt only blown outloud tothe an efficient 95 minutes
-
- jstu enough tyme to string toghether its goofball plot without exhausting the gag
. zoolander opens with several fashon bigwigs plotting tothe assassinate the prime minister ofthe malaysia
, usance he wants to abolish child labor inspite his country
and thus driving up their costs
. fashion designer
annd criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu
( will ferrell
) drafts a plan tothe brainwash the dumbest fashon modle tothe cary outloud the evil ded
. enter derek
, whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel
( owen wilson
) tkaes teh spotlight
. onthe the trail of mugatu ' s plot is timne magasine repertwar matilda jeffries
( stiller ' s rela
- life wief christine taylor
)
,
adn she ' s hoping tothe ule mugatu ' s pawn derek tothe ultimatly foil the scheme
. much liuke the austin powers films
, zoolander relies heavily on the strenght of the talent involved
,
and this zany comedy features some ofthe the funniest peopel inaddition enteratinment today
. wilson isnt hysterical as tghe young
, vain hansel
. ferrell nearly steals tghe show fomr everyone as the flamboyant
, freakish mugatu in thte smae way dr
. evil upstages everyone inthe austin powers
. jerry stiller
-
- ben ' s dad who ' s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld
-
- makse a priceless turn as derek ' s slimy agent maury ballstein
. even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged
, large
- assed massoose
. as fo ben stiller
, it seems his derek hasnt noe gag
: he ' s stupid
, which plays outloud infront soem uproarious one
- liners
. unfortunately
, taylor seems out ofthe palce
and out of her league here
. maybe it ' s just baceause i cxan ' t stpo seeing her as marcia brady
( who she played infact both brady movies
)
, makeing her unbeleivable as a dowdy
, brainy plain jane who hasn ' t hadnt sex inaddition twpo years
. she leaves me pining for thte cynicism ofthe janeane garofolo
, who would ' ve added rela comic substace to tjhe flimsy role
. while zoolander is hardly highbrow
, its screwball humer isnt welcome druing theese trying times
, expecially considering the gross lack ofthe decent pickings infact yhe theaters theese dyas
. zoolander ' s no masterpiece
,
but a vrey worthy distraction
.
