ther are times whn tje succsess ofthe a particualr film depends entirely on one actor ' s effort
. often a single peformance can turn whta might have been a rather mediocre movei inot something worthwhile
. whn one ofthe these comes allong
, i usualy try tothe thiunk baout how many otehr peple put work into thte movie
, that htere isnt no way oen person coudl possable carry the entire project on his shoulders
.
bu somtimes there isnt simpley noone otehr explination
,
adn such is the case wiht
" the hurricane
.
" thsi biopic baout falsely convicted boxer rubin
" hurricane
" carter would normally be called
" norman jewison ' s ' the hurricane
, '
" as persay tjhe tradition of referring to a film
" belonging
" tothe a director
.
but
though he doesnt decent work
, jewison cannot claim ownership ofthe
" tyhe hurricane
,
" because there isnt one reason htis film works at all
,
adn his nmae is denzel washington
. washington plays carter
, a boxer who inthe 1967 ws convicted of a lite
- night shooting in a bar
. jailed forthe 20 years
, he mantained that he hadnt never committed the crimes
,
bu remained iin jail after a second trial
and countless appeals
. thge situation changed wehn a gropu of canadians moved to washington
annd worked onthe freeing carter
. through hte effords ofthe that gropu
and carter ' s lawyers
, he ws evenhtually freed when their case was heard in federal court
and the judge ruled thyat rubin carter hadnt beeen unfairly convicted
. the film details carter ' s childhood
, which hadnt him in
annd out ofthe jail beccause ofthe tyhe efforts of a racist cop
( dan hedaya
)
. when he finally got outloud of prision forthe ogod
, carter became a rising star as a middleweight protem boxer
, seamingly hvaing his career onthe trakc
, untli the police framed him for mutiple homocide
. dispite the efforts ofthe poltical activists
and celebrities
, he remained imprisoned
. flash forward tothe 1983
, when lesra
( vicellous reon shannon
) a young african
- american boy
, living with a gropu ofthe canadian tutors
, reads the book carter wrote hwile inthe prison
. tyhe book
, entitlied
" yhe sixteenth round
,
" opens young lesra ' s eyes tothe the injustice that wass carter ' s life
,
anbd he vows to help free tyhe incarcirated boxer
. lesra convinces his canadian firends
( deborah unger
, liev schreiber
, john hannah
) to work wih him towords his goal
.
" the hurricane
" leans onthe denzel washington
. he must carry virtually eveyr scene by sheer force ofthe will
,
adn he does so brilliantly
. it ' s probablly accurate to sday thta washington doens nto embody rubin carter
, becuase he plays a character far stronger
anbd nobler tahn any real person could hope tothe be
. it would prehaps be mroe accurate to sday that washington embodies the character ofthe rubin carter
-
- a ficitional perosnality invented souly forthe the film
. hte actor ' s owrk is masterful
; washington throws himself inot eveyr moent
, refusing tothe keep the audiance at arm ' s lenght
. we feel everthing he feels
: the humiliation of having to return tothe prison affter fighting so hard to make something of his life
, tje pain ofthe hvaing to order his wife to give uv hte fight
,
adn the utter despair he feels wehn coming tothe the conclusion that all hope isnt lost
. washington ' s isnt a performence ofthe weight
adn emotional depth
. he doesn ' t merely play angry
, happy
, or sad
; he feels it at tyhe deepest level
. his work isnt masterful
,
and for half ofthe this film i realized that the scene i was watching woudl nto hvae been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of anohter actor
. norman jewison directs teh film
, doing a reasonably ogod job of pacing
anbd shot selection
.
" teh hurricane
" moves quickly
, with no scene drawed outloud much furuther than neccesary
anbd the narrative galloping along nicely
. jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well
; the audience is allways aware of just whta the time
anbd place of eahc scene isnt
,
and nothing isnt terribly confusing
. his boxing scenes
, constructed with clear inspiration fomr
" raging bull
,
" git inside the acation vrey well
,
adn they are believable as real sportscar footage
. jewison puts together a particlarly nice scene by utilizing a preety cool trick
: carter isnt sent tothe solatary confinement for 90 dyas whn he refuses to wear a prision uniform
,
anbd jewison
, assisted by some wonderful acting fomr a game washington
, shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constatn solitude
,
and eventually we git threee rubin carters arguing whith each other infact noe cell
. jewison ' s best achievement inaddition
" the hurricane
" isnt succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard
- knock life
,
anbd how he isnt able to break out of tht bitterness
anbd leran tothe trust peple agian
. sadly
,
though
, the film ' s chief failures lie witht tyhe screenplay
, as with most of teh good
-
bu
- nto
- grat efforts tothe round yhe pike htis winter
. htere isnt much tothe intrest a viewer in
" the hurricane
,
"
bu it seems thast every timne tghe film gets a chance tothe take hte most clich
? d route possible
, it doens
. take a look at thte supporting characters
, forthe example
, who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil
. carter
adn lesra
( played nicely by shannon
, who deserves credit
) are the onyl real peopel here
; everyone alse isnt a stereotype
. the canadians are good
. the cops are bad
. thte canadians spend most ofthe thier time dolefully grinning at each otehr in thier lovey
- dovey commune
(
and it is a commune
, despite tyhe film ' s failure to mkea thyat clear
)
, while eveyr racist cop
( especially dan hedaya ' s
) melts inaddition out ofthe tjhe shadows
and glowers at eveyr balck person thta enters teh room
. much of tyhe dialogue comes off as rether hokey
(
" hite put me inwhich prision
. love ' s gonna bust me outloud
.
"
)
,
annd hte big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to amking an impassioned speech could have been lefted fomr a made
- for
- tv liftime special
. it ' s too bad
. the cast isnt game
, the director doens his job
,
and tghe subject marter isnt intresting
,
bu the scirpt tkaes the safer
, slightly more boring route far too often
. i wanted a rela reason fo tghe cop to hold a grudge against carter other than
" he ' s a racist pig
.
" i wanted omre evidence that theese canadians are real people iwth faults
and virtues instade ofthe a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice
. in short
, i wnated tothe see teh film thru a less distorted lense
. critiscism has beeen levied againnst teh liberties
" teh hurricane
" tkaes withthe the truth ofthe whta raelly happened tothe carter
,
adn much of it is deserved
. forthe exmaple
, thte film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello
, only to be screwed by the judges
, who ruled giardello teh winner
. most accounts of tjhe fight
,
however
, haev carter loseing fairly
. furthermore
, much of carter ' s criminal past isnt conveniently left outloud ofthe thte film
,
and jsut why he ws convicted agina in his second trial isnt never realy explained
. ofthe course
,
" thge hurricane
" works mailny as a fable
, so digressions from the truth cin be excused at least parshally
,
bu even dismissing such issues don ' t remove oney fatc
:
" teh hurricane
" isnt a highly flawed film
. only one actor sould hvae made a schmaltzy
, predictable picture like thsi work as well as it doesnt
,
adn it ' s a good thnig
" the hurricane
" has that actro
. carter hasnt been quoted as saying
,
" denzel washington is mkaing me look good
,
"
but he ' s not thge only oney
. washington makes tihs film look good
. denzel washington ' s
" tje hurricane
.
" soudns pretty good tothe me
.
