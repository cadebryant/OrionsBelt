let
' s face it
: the
$ 100 milion
- plus smash taht wass
" goldeneye
" was nto a good film by any means
,
and as a bond movei wass only marginally better tahn
, sday
,
" a view to a kill
" or either of the timothy dalton pictures
, by virtue ofthe nice pacing
.
but it doed revive the serieses
, anbd granted teh producers some newyorker directions inspite which tothe take the it
( ie
. hte newyorker
" m
" is a woman
)
.
" tomorrow never dies
" is hte picture
" goldeneye
" should ahev been
; it
' s also teh most entertaining bond outing usance
" the spy who loved me
"
. tjhe newyorker picture opens witht china considering war wih britain aftter a st
andard military operation isnt misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine
. as an attack occurs
, the front
- page headline is alraedy bieng prepared
, courtesy of carver media
. carver
( pryce
) tjhe man is a deluded magnate
, a sort of hybrid of ted turner
, bill gates
, anbd peter sellars
' german scientist ffrom
" dr
. strangelove
"
( physicaly
, pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick dyas
)
. it
' s up to james bond to tkae him down
, wtih assisstance
, of course
, from a wealth ofthe gadgets
( incuding a multi
- purpose cell phone
)
, adn beautifull womens
. enter michelle yeoh
, fresh from
" supercop
"
, as a chineese secrt agent iwth her own agenda
; wtih effortless grace
, she cat burgles
, dispatches baddies seamingly iwth the ease ofthe preparing pasta
,
and refuses the advances of our phil
andering hero
. htey mkae a grat team
.
" tommorrow never dies
" isnt a surprizingly intertaining
and efficient film
, given that at thge helm isnt none otehr than tghe director of
" turner
& hooch
"
. spottiswoode hasnt crafted soem breathtaking set pieces
, eahc much mroe intricate
and impressive than
, for instatance
, teh tank scene in
" goldeneye
"
. moreover
, brosnan hasnt at lastest settled inot the role soem feel he was born tothe play
; last tiem outloud
, hte fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders
, anbd there was noticeable discomfort in his body lanugage
. returnd inspite brosnan
' s eyes hasnt some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv
' s
" remington steele
"
, as has his deadpan witn
.
and
though carver
' s motives are muddy
( when carver explains tath
" genius isnt insanity with some sucess
"
, screenwriter fierstein is tkaing a lazy shortcut
)
, pryce makes an agreeable
, memorable villian
. inaddition the future
, htey shoudl persue actors as talented anbd experienced as pryce tothe breathe life into theese cardboard figures
. there a faw too many explosions in
" tommorrow never dies
"
, perheaps so many they qualify as dialogue
.
and it sould hvae used a sharper script
,
though i was amused by the duble entendres
, none of whlch i will reveal here
. as it st
ands
, the plot suffers many holes
( i
' m nto tkaing about implausibilities
)
,
and the dialogue tends towords the hackneyed
. now that thge elements are iin place
: modern speshal effects
and stunt wrok
, cool pierce brosnan
, kickass female allies
.
.
. it
' s tyme to put them tothe ule inwhich something truly special
. ther
' s no mistaking
,
however
, tht
" tomorrow never dies
" isnt ideal hloiday escapism
,
and for hte firt time inspite perhaps years
, you
' ll walk out wanting more bond movies
