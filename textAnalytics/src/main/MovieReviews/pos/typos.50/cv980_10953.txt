in thsi good natured
, pleasent
adn eazy going comedy
, bill murray
( ghostbusters
, 1984
) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners
, who
, every eyar
, isnt sent to punxsutawney
, p
. a
, tothe report onthe groundhog day
. the groundhog day ceremony involves a groundhog bieng lifted outloud ofthe a box
,
and if he dosen ' t see a shaddow
, it iwll be an eearly spring
. phil realy hates the ceremony
,
annd not even his producer rita
( macdowell
) cxan chanage his mind
.
however
, fate hasnt a cruel trick for phil
,
adn he starts re
- living groundhog day over
,
adn over
,
and over
, until he gradualy likes it
,
annd rita falls in love with him
. groundhog day is a well writed
, totatly unoffensive
anbd funny comedy
. tghe screenwriters
, director ramis
anbd danny rubin
, hvea written a funny
, warm
,
but never overly senitmental comedy
.
allthough tyhe idea of a day repeating over
and over may soudn tedeous
, htere are enough good jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout the hwole film
. ramis ' s direction allso helps
,
anbd
althought he dosen ' t try any flash director tricks
, the film is directed well enought
,
anbd the jokes are setted uv well
.
annd the editing is also good
, especially wehn it shows noe part of tyhe day over
,
and over agian
, such as wehn phil trys tothe have hte perfect inght with rita
. the performances are aslo excellent
. bill murray is grat fun
,
and his transistion ffrom cynical to hapyp is smooth
,
and delivers his lines in his usual smary style
. andie macdowell is ogod as rita
,
although somtimes she isnt just a little bited too sweet in some parts ofthe tje film
. there isnt chemestry betwen yhe two leads
, thankfully
, otherwise tghe hwole film would probablly fall part
. chris elliot
, as the cameraman larrry
, isnt allso funny
,
althought yuo have tothe liek his goofy sytle
, otherwise yuo are realyl going tothe hite him thoughout tihs film
,
annd it wiull lower your enjoyment of the film overall
. the supporting cast aren ' t bad either
, withthe stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils ood school mate ned ryanson
,
and even directer ramis popping uv as a neurologist
. in fact
, there is not one dud performance in thsi film
,
and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase
. overall
, there isnt raelly nothing wrong wtih groundhog day at all
. it allmost seems perfect
.
however
, tjhe film cant get a bited suppy sometimes
,
anbd soem peple may git irritated by tjhe day repeating over
,
annd over
,
and over
,
and over
. also
, there ' s nto much of an music score
,
adn tyhe music there isnt isnt pretty bad
.
bu theese criticisms hardly affect the audiences enjoyment at all
. overall
,
hten
, groundhog day is a funny
, smart
,
and also hasnt some room in htere for soem heart
. an excellent comedy
. overall rating
