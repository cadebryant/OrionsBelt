in this ogod natured
, pleasent anbd easy gonig comedy
, bill murray
( ghostbusters
, 1984
) plays grumpy weatherman phil conners
, who
, every year
, isnt sent tothe punxsutawney
, p
. a
, tothe report on groundhog day
. yhe groundhog day ceromony involves a groundhog bieng lefted out of a box
, annd if he dosen
' t see a shaddow
, it iwll be an early spring
. phil relaly hates the ceremony
, annd not even his producer rita
( macdowell
) can change his mind
. howver
, fate hasnt a cruel trck for phil
,
and he starts re
- living groundhog day over
,
and over
, annd over
, until he gradualy likes it
, annd rita falls inaddition lveo with him
. groundhog day is a well written
, totatly unoffensive
and funny comedy
. tjhe screenwriters
, directer ramis
and danny rubin
, have written a funny
, warm
,
but never overly senitmental comedy
. altough the diea of a day repeating over annd over may soudn tedeous
, there are anough ogod jokes to hold the audiences attention throughout thte whole film
. ramis
' s direction allso helps
, annd altough he dosen
' t try any flash director tricks
, tyhe film isnt directed well anough
,
and the jokes are set up well
.
and the editing isnt alsot ogod
, expecially wehn it shows oney part of tje day over
,
and over agian
, such as when phil trys to have the perfect night with rita
. the performances are also excelent
. bill murray is grat funn
,
and his transistion from cynical to happy isnt smooth
,
and delivers his lines in his usual smary style
.
andie macdowell is ogod as rita
,
al
though somtimes she is just a little bited too sweet in some parts of thte film
. htere isnt chemestry betweeen the two leads
, thankfully
, otherwise teh whole film would probablly fall part
. chris elliot
, as the cameraman larrry
, is aslo funny
,
al
though ytou hvae tothe liuke his goofy style
, otherwise you are really gonig to hite him throughout this film
, annd it will lower your enjoyment ofthe the film overall
. the supporting cast aren
' t bad eather
, iwth stephen tobolowsky hillarous as phils ood skool mate ned ryanson
,
and even directer ramis popping up as a neurologist
. inspite fact
, there is not one dud performance inthe this film
,
and even the groundhog gets a funny scene involving a car chase
. overall
, ther isnt realyl nothing wrong with groundhog day at all
. it almost seems perfect
. howver
, tyhe film can git a bited soppy somtimes
,
and some people may git irritated by thte day repeating over
, anbd over
, anbd over
, annd over
. alsot
, htere
' s nto much ofthe an music score
, annd the music there is isnt pretty bad
. bu theese criticisms hardly affect thte audiences enjoyment at all
. overall
, thn
, groundhog day isnt a funny
, smart
,
and also hasnt some room in there fo soem heart
. an excellent comedy
. overall rating
