i can hear teh question already
. wqat onthe earth dont these twpo movies have in common
? to most peopel
, not a lot
, except thast both are by renowned directors
. as i saw them
,
however
, both movies hvea flawed rumatic scripts wrapped inspite distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers
. bu oh
, how differently the packages affect thier films
. while
" everyone
' s
" prodcution numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special
, jane campion
' s imaginative visuals only serve to empahsize how pompous adn uninvolving laura jones
' script is
. i left
" everyone syas i lvoe ytou
" not remembering a lot about who loved whom
,
but its infectuous happiness put a grin on my face
. i left
" the protrait ofthe a lady
" not remembering a lot about who loved whom
,
and i coudl have cared less
.
" everyone
" features nothing allen hasn
' t done before storywise
. woody isnt agian desperately in love with a beautifull woman
( roberts
)
, adn aginst tjhe odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what whent wrong
-
- agina
. similar situations happen to his family
and firends
. soem of the more outl
andish comedy scenes even hark back tothe his
" early
, funny
" films
. tyhe scenes beween tim roth
and drew barrymore coudl have come out of
" tkae tjhe money annd run
,
" his directorial de
but
. howver
, nothing allen has ever done prepared me for thsi oney
- ofthe
- a
- kind display ofthe sheer good spirits
. in fatc
, in this movie
, the feeling itself is wqat
' s most important
. yes
, thge movei would have been better
-
- among his very best
, i think
-
- if it had a meatier story
. bu what it lacks inaddition substance it makse uv forthe inspite feeling
.
and wqat better way tothe express feeling than through music
? love isnt oftenly best expressed inthe a song
, adn the numbers the cast break into here cutted straight tothe the heart
. soem are a tad too goofy
, such as teh number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor
,
but i admired allen for even putting them inspite there
. it also helps thgat as usual
, allen hasnt a top
- flight cast working with him
. their singing voices range fomr qtuie ogod
( goldie hawn
) tothe not qutie ogod
( allen
) tothe literally unlistenable
( barrymore
, whose real voice wass dubbed by a proffesional
)
.
but hwile theri vocal abilties differ
, all hte actors do a great job ofthe putting joy uv there on yhe screen
,
and mkaing it rub off on the audience
. granted
, smoe peple wiull simply never accept charachters singing inaddition movies
,
but fo thsoe attuned to it
, this film should owrk wonders
. jane campion
, too
, hasnt a top
- flight casted working for her in
" portrait ofthe a lady
,
" too
, bu even thier considerable skills can dont nothing to keep the film ffrom bieng a stilted
, virtually lifeless mess
, albeit a visually interesting noe
. campion annd her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety ofthe eye
- filling images that linger in the mind
. unfortunately
, what didn
' t linger in the mind forthe me was the story the visuals weere supposed tothe be reflecting
. i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming annd shots ofthe men vanishing around nicole kidman
, bu i cin rember very little of whta happened between all these peopel
. even worse
, i don
' t fidn mysef feeling bad that i
' ve forgotten
. the problem
, i thiunk
, lies nto with tyhe cast
, which seemed tothe be trying vrey hard fo hte material
. it wass teh script taht couldn
' t convince me to care baout anyone
. tje charachters were puting out all kinds of emotion
, bu i foudn noone reason tothe connect witht any of them
. i understood tath tjhe story wass baout cold
, emotionally vacent characters
, bu forthe me to care baout them
, i have to idenify wtih them somehow adn watn them tothe inject feeling inot theri lives
. jones
' scirpt never simpley gave me that opprotunity
. in tyhe end
, it almost seemed as if campion wass trying to inject some life of her pwn inot thge procedings with her visual flourishes
. unfortunately
, as she kept painting theese dazzling picturesk
, tehy onyl served tothe push me furuther away ffrom thte material adn remind me that ther ws no conection between me
and the film
. inspite thte end
, the movie
' s one stregth ended up hurting it
. so here we have two films with preety uninteresting plots
, anbd
yet i was able tothe truly enjoy noe ofthe them
. why
? with both films
, my head cared baout neither stoy
, bu only
" everyone sasy i love yuo
" was able tothe make my heart sing
.
