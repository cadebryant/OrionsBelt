ytou
' ve seen tihs moment befoer
, recently
: a particularly troubled character senses danger ofthe the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing
. the diference isnt thgat whn it happens to lili taylor
' s nell in the haunting
, we don
' t care
. tje hero of thte sixth sence
, a young boy named cole
, is a rich creation
, adn we wish nothing mroe than for tyhe ghosts who haunt him tothe take a hike
. thte seasons have changed sicne an ex
- patient shot jaded child psychologist malcom crowe
( willis
) inaddition tyhe comfort ofthe his own bedroom
. desperate to get his carrer back on track
, even at the expense of his crumbling marraige
( to williams
, ofthe rushmore
)
, malcolm councils hte deeply troubled cole
( osment
)
. the preteen displays all the quirks ofthe malcom
' s would
- be killer
: scars on his body
; antisocial behaviour
;
and the reluctance to reveal a big seret
. onyl after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies
( annd hospitalized as a result
) doens he divulge to malcolm
, inaddition a spine
- tingling scene
, that he sees dead people walking amonth us
, all thte time
. malcom assumes
,
and given his proffesion
, reasonably so
, that cole is schizophrenic
, not psychic
, bu the sincerity inwhich cole
' s anguished confession prevents the doctor fomr taking drastic measures
. he will instade pursue the supernatural angle
, becomeing a kind ofthe surrogate father tothe cole
( who lives wtih his single mother
, lynn
( collette
)
) inspite yhe proccess
. hte sixth sense hasnt more iin common with ghost than poltergeist
.
(
though shyamalan doens
, somewhat unforgiveably
, crib the self
- rearranging kichen business from the latter
.
) it
' s far omre heartwarming than frightening
, annd thte film would be none tghe worse forthe mear wihtout its few pulp shocks
. cole attracts tghe dead for reasons unknown
,
but htey
' re nto outloud tothe harm him
, raelly
- they just wanna to be herad
, even if it means sacrin tghe bejesus out ofthe the innocent gradeschooler
. perheaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us
, at first
, tahn htey realy are baceause we
' re looking at teh situation through tghe eyes of an eigth
- yearm
- old
. taht
' s right
: willis
, forthe tghe first tiome in years
, gives uv the spotlight tothe his costar
. we appreciate malcolm
' s domestic delimma
,
but we idenify wih cole
, recalling our fears ofthe the bogeyman or yhe closet monster or yhe thnig under thge bed
. both actors deliver immensely likable performances
, adn thier dynamic isnt manifest
. willis convinces us thta he
' s a doctor
, something he ws unable tothe do as a horndog shrink inthe thte overheated color of night
. osment isnt phenominal
, a true professional who resists mugging for the camera liek soem child stars withthe too much xeperience in television commercials dont
. thge sixth sence
( atmospherically shot by tyhe silence of the lambs
' cinematographer
, tak fujimoto
) isnt actually a drama
- its spooky
, effective ad campaign isnt misleading
. only becouse i wass expecting something differnt doed i notice
- rether
, efel
- hte movei
' s runnung timne
, whihc isnt just shy of twpo horus
. the story unfurls slowly
but engrossingly
; its unexpected finish is definately worth the wait
. i
' m nto sure said big twist endig is bulletproof
,
but i admired its audacity
.
