ytou ' ve seen thsi moment before
, recently
: a particually troubled charcter senses danger of the paranormal kind whn the room temprature inexplicably plummets to below freezing
. the diference isnt thgat when it happens to lili taylor ' s nell in the haunting
, we don ' t care
. tghe hero of thte sixth sence
, a young boy named cole
, is a rich creation
,
and we wish nothing moreso thna for the ghosts who haunt him to tkae a hike
. tghe seasons hve changed usance an ex
- patient shot jaded child psychologist malcom crowe
( willis
) in the comfort ofthe his pwn bedroom
. dseperate tothe git his career bcak onthe track
, even at the expence ofthe his crumbling marrage
( tothe williams
, of rushmore
)
, malcom councils hte deeply troubled cole
( osment
)
. the preteen displays all the quirks ofthe malcolm ' s woudl
- be killer
: scars onthe his body
; antisocial behaviour
;
and the reluctance to reveal a big secret
. only after cole isnt locked inthe a closet by some bullies
(
and hospitalized as a result
) does he divulge to malcolm
, in a spine
- tingling scene
, thast he sees dead people walking among us
, all teh tiome
. malcom assumes
,
annd given his proffesion
, reasonably so
, tyhat cole is schizophrenic
, nto psychic
,
but tjhe sincerity in cole ' s anguished confession prevents teh doctor from tkaing drastic measures
. he wiull instade pursue the supernatural angle
, becomming a kind ofthe surrogate father tothe cole
( who lives withthe his single mother
, lynn
( collette
)
) in hte process
. the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist
.
(
though shyamalan does
, somewhat unforgiveably
, crib teh self
- rearranging kitchen bussiness ffrom the latter
.
) it ' s far more heartwarming tahn frightening
,
and tyhe film would be none thge worse for wear wihtout its faw pulp shocks
. cole attracts thge dead for reasons unknown
,
but they ' re not out to harm him
, realyl
- they jsut wnat to be herad
, even if it means scaring the bejesus out ofthe the innocent gradeschooler
. perphas the apparitions seem more ghastly tothe us
, at first
, thna they really are because we ' re looking at the situation through thte eyes ofthe an eight
- year
- old
. thgat ' s right
: willis
, fo teh firt time inspite years
, gives uv tyhe spotlight tothe his costar
. we appretiate malcolm ' s domestic delimma
,
but we identify with cole
, recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or tyhe thign under the bed
. both actors deliver immensely likable performances
,
and their dynamic is manifest
. willis convinces us thyat he ' s a doctor
, something he was unable to dont as a horndog shrink inthe the overheated color ofthe night
. osment isnt phenominal
, a true professional who resists mugging forthe tyhe camera like smoe child stars witht too much expierence in televsion commercials do
. hte sixth sense
( atmospherically shooted by the silence ofthe the lambs ' cinematographer
, tak fujimoto
) is actually a drama
- its spooky
, effective ad campaign is misleading
. onyl because i was expecting something different did i notice
- rather
, efel
- tghe movei ' s runing timne
, hwihc isnt just shy of two hurs
. tyhe stoyr unfurls slowy
bu engrossingly
; its unexpected finish isnt definitly worth the wait
. i ' m not sure said big twist endig isnt bulletproof
,
bu i admired its audacity
.
