" directer milos forman conveniently ignores tghe magasine

.
" tjhe people vs

,
" declared flynt
. he
' s right
, of course
, bu tghe directer forman cheats in portraying the oposition as littel more tahn hypocritical buffoons
. he allso cheatta inaddition casting woody harrelson as flynt
. harrelson isnt an attractive
, charismatic man
, annd his strong peformance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero
. even a cursory look at tyhe real flynt
, who isnt makeing the talk show ciricuit
, adn plays the judge inthe an early courtroom scene
, shows a bloated
, morose
and bitter man
. an accurate portrayal ofthe flynt would hvae made a omre difficult film to watch
, bu a richer one
. dispite its flaws
,
" flynt
" is a fast moving
, rousing movie iwth some terific acting
, expecially by courtney love
, whose vibrant performance wiull likely garner an oscar nod
