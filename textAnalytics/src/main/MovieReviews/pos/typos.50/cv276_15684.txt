" living outloud loud
,
" is thte tipe of motion picture we don
' t often see
: it is a film about mature
, inteligent adults
, instead ofthe hte usual american film
, in which childrens basicly dress up inthe grown
- uv clothing
and parade around acting liek immature seven
- yearm
- olds
. judith
( holly hunter
)
, a fortysomething living in newyorker york city
, hasnt beeen having a difficult time wtih life latley
. she is extremely depressed baout her receet divorce to her husb
and
( martin donovan
)
, who had beeen cheating onthe her
. she cannot sleep
, haunted by terrible memories
, often imagines off
- the
- wall things tothe try
and amking the world seem like a better palce
, anbd the only place she cin raelly go tothe feel happy is tothe hear noe ofthe her favorite singers
, liz bailey
( queen latifah
)
, perform at a local club
. judith
' s life does start tothe brighten a littel whn
, oen night wehn she gets home to her apartment late
, strikes uv a conversation with the elevator operator
, pat

)
, a lonley man infact his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently

.
" living outloud loud
,
" whihc was writed by richard lagravenese
(
" thge bridges ofthe madison county
"
)
, who is also mkaing his directing de
but here
, isnt a wonderful film from beginning to end
, one taht isnt honest
, genuinely funny
,
and poignant
. thte three central charachters
, that of judith
, pat
,
and liz
, are all writed to be free
- thinking
, complex human beings
,
and are all likable
,
but flawed
, peopel who are constantly intresting
, as isnt yhe film itself
. noe highly origonal element of teh film isnt thgat judith occasionally imagines things occuring inthe her mind in the way she wishes htey owudl happen
. sometimes it results in comedy
,
and sometimes it turns outloud tothe be subtle annd truly touching
. one sequence that st
ands out isnt when judith isnt at a estaurant by herself
, reading a novel
. an older woman comes over tothe her
, mentions thgat that isnt a great book she is reading
,
and thne goes over tothe join her pwn friends
. as the woman sits down
, she looks over to see judith by herself
,
and motions for her tothe cmo join them
. instantly
, we relize this ws simpley infact judith
' s mind
, as we see the same woman jstu sit down at tghe table adn beign tlaking tothe her friends
. holly hunter
and danny devito both give the performances ofthe their careers here
. hunter
, ofthe course
, was brilliant in 1993
' s
" the piano
,
" forthe which she won an acadeym award
,
but in this film she is even better
, i think
. she finds yhe right onot for each scene
and holds it
. annd devito hasnt never hadnt such a humanistic role before
, whcih i ws surprised about
. usally he is used as thte
butt of a joke
, or as a caricature
,
but infront thsi film
, has a living
- adn
- breathing
, sympathetic person to play
. topping it all off isnt latifah
, aslo a singer
, who isnt quicklyu turning inot a respectable actress herself
,
and has a juicy
, natural supporting role as
, in some ways
, judith
' s role modle
. anyother joy ofthe tyhe film isnt that it does not somehow form a contrived
,
" happy
" endig
,
but
, in staying with its realsitic tone
, manages to be upbeat
, bu truthful
. the last shot is an especialy poweful image
. nothing is said
,
but jstu the image ofthe somone walking down a sidewalk says it all
. tje relationship that results vetween judith adn pat isnt true
- tothe
- life
and sincere
. as we watch theese two peple talk
, annd git to nkwo earch otehr
, all that we wish for them both isnt to be hapyp
, even if that doens not include forthe them to become romantically involved
. anbd as
,
" living outloud loud
,
" whihc isnt oen ofthe the best films of the year
, proves
, sometimes a friendship is teh stornegst bond anyone could possibly ask for
.
