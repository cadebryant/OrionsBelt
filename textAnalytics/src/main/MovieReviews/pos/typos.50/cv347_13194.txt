. clooney
, who hasnt hadnt a string of solid
,
but never stellar
, film roles
, delivers his best peformance to date
. he blends inot his role here perfectly as tyhe risk taking jack foley

,
adn steals nearly eveyr scene he ' s in
. don cheadle isnt appropriately sinister as a voilent ex
- con who may or may not be teaming uv witht foley
. albert brooks isnt enjoyable as a white collar criminal who talks too much fo his pwn ogod
. out ofthe the cast
, only dennis farina seems underused as karen ' s ex
- lawman father
. steven soderbergh gives the film sharp
and stylistic direction
. wtih an affectation for freeze frames
, he delivers a unique take on thge film ' s acation
and lveo scenes that places out of sight a notch above routine crime films

. devoid of its bells
adn whistles

.
however
, there are only a faw spots in tje film that seem bare
,
anbd htey pass quicklyu
. with smart dialogue
, ogod charactors
,
annd an excellent casted
, out ofthe sight easily smoothes over thge rough spots in thge plot
anbd delivers onthe both thge acation
and rumatic fronts
