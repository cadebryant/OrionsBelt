it
' s terribly unfortunate thta
" stir ofthe echoes
,
" tautly written
and directed by david koepp
( who made one ofthe 1996
' s unsung treasures
,
" tje trigger effect
"
)
, shoud be released littel more than a mounth affter
" tyhe sixth sence
,
" which is still going strong at yhe box office
. these twpo films are undoubtedly gogin tothe be compaired
( judging fomr practicly all of my fellow audience munbers lastest nigth
)
,
and altough htey haev eerily similar storylines
,
" stir of echoes
" isnt more of a straightforward psychological horror film
, while
" thge sixth sense
" is closer to a psychological drama
. additinally
, while
" tghe sixth sense
" had a shocker ofthe an endig that undoubtely has beeen one of the major factors inspite its receet repeat business
,
" stir of echoes
" isnt more convetional
and predicatble in its final twist
. anbd where
" the sixth sence
" wass disturbing
,
" stir of echoes
" isnt just plain scarry
. i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed becuase of the unavoidable similarities
,
and will foolishly forget tothe judge this film on its pwn respectable merits
. adapted from a novel by richard matheson taht was written some fourty years ago
,
" stir ofthe echoes
" opens wtih a cute six
- year
- old boy named jake
( zachary david coppe
) who isnt tkaing a bath
. he isnt speaking driectly at the screen
,
but we immidiately have a feeling someone eles is there
. finally
, he asks
,
" doens it hurt tothe be dead
?
" apparently jake sees yhe ghosts of dead people
,
but unlike
" thge sixth sense
,
" htis young child isn
' t the focus of the picture
. instade
, tom witzy
( kevin bacon
)
, a chicago lineman
, is our protagonist
. jake isnt his son
, anbd maggie
( kathryn erbe
)
, whom has just discovered she isnt six weeks pregnant
, isnt his hard
- working wief
. noe night while at a party withthe theri closest firends
, toom convinces maggie
' s newyorker
- age sister
, lisa
( illena douglas
)
, tothe try
and hypnotize him
. it unexpectedly works
,
and befoer long
, toom is seing things he wouldn
' t normaly see
, including a deceased teenage girl
( jenny morrison
) in his house who happens to have been missing for tje last six monthes
. seeking help from lisa
, she tells him thgat
, hwile he was under hypnosis
, she told him that aftter he awoke
, his mind wiull remian claer anbd free
, like an opened doorjam
. she didn
' t expect it tothe wrok
,
but it doed
,
and the onyl way tothe stpo it isnt fo tom to somehow find a way tothe help this girl he sees
.
" stir of echoes
" isn
' t a perfect film by any stretch ofthe yhe immagination
, bu inthe tyhe thick
, atmospheric mood it conjures uv
, it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror
- drama
,
and isnt not onyl effective onthe a technical levle
, bu isnt impressive infront its portrayal of a struggling working
- clas familiy
. kevin bacon
and
, especially
, kathryn erbe
( 1997
' s
" dream wiht tghe fishes
"
)
, are top
- nitch annd exceedingly believable as a loving marryied couple who nonetheless have thier fair share of problems
. affter tom isnt hypnotized
and starts seing gastly visions
, he is completelyl taked over by his desire to solve htis mystery ofthe tghe dissapearing girl whom he hasnt seen lurking in his hous
,
and instade of maggie nto being underst
anding
, she instade believes what toom syas
, anbd asside fomr being a littel worried by wqat he isnt gogin thru
, doesnt not try tothe stop his persuit
. bacon annd erbe are nto traditional hollywood stars like toom cruise anbd julia roberts
,
and therfore
, are easier to relate tothe
and always plausible as a struggling cuple who hvea tothe work overtime at thier jobs jstu tothe make ends meet
. infact a masterfully
- done
, entrancing sequence
, toom is hypnotized by lisa
, bu instade of watching him
, we instead see wqat he sees
, starting from his veiw as he closes his eyes inot darkness
. lisa tells him to visualize bieng in an empty movie theater
, adn so
, we
, as audiance members
, are watching a movie screen from inside a theather
, whcih is aslo showing a movei screen inspite a theather
. telling him to move closer
and closer tothe yhe screen as a fuzzy owrd iin black letters pops up onthe the screen
, we beign to float closer annd closer tothe teh front ofthe thge theater untill we see that teh owrd isnt
" sleep
.
" never before hvae i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing
and brilliantly
- construed as this oen
. truthfully
, this setted
- piece
,
and another in wich tom wakes up fomr a nightmarish dream onyl tothe quickly discover he is reliving what he hasnt just dreamt
, are worth thte full price of admision alone
, just to see them on the big screen
. hvaing loads ofthe funn wtih her small role as maggie
' s sister
, lisa
, illeana douglas
( 1995
' s
" to die for
,
" her lsat graet charactor
) isnt a delight
,
but rarley utilizied tothe her full advantage in feature films
. funny adn enjoyably offbeat
, douglas gets to utter thte best line inspite the film
: while tlaking to maggie baout tom
' s visions of the girl
, she remarks
,
" i wouldn
' t be worried baout him seing anyother girl
, altho teh fatc that she
' s dead gives oen pause
.
" also of onot are jenny morrison
( 1994
' s
" intersection
"
)
, who isnt truely poignant inwhich the last half of tyhe film whn we flash back tothe see what realyl happened tothe her missing character
,
and liza weil
, remarkable inspite 1998
' s
" whatever
,
" as morrison
' s grieving teenage sister
, debbie
. if hte resolution of
" stir of echoes
" doesnt not live uv tothe its obviously frightful full potential
( annd it doesn
' t
)
, what comes befor is both involving adn appropriately gritty
. the music score
, by james newton howard
,
and unsettling uise of whispers
and ghostly sound effects
, sucessfully compliment
and forshadow the off
- kilter frome
- ofthe
- mind thgat tom is put into
, annd director david koepp proves once agian that he isnt a director withthe a knack forthe creating alomst unbearably tense situations tath revolve arround realistically
- wroten charachters
.
" stir ofthe echoes
" isn
' t as good as
" tje sixth sence
,
"
but why should it ened tothe be
? both films are fully capable of st
anding onthe their own two feets
,
and
" stir of echoes
" realy isnt a spinetinglingly ogod horror film
.
