it ' s terribly unfortunate thyat
" stir ofthe echoes
,
" tautly written
anbd directed by david koepp
( who made oen of 1996 ' s unsung treasures
,
" yhe trigger effect
"
)
, shoudln be released littel more than a month after
" the sixth sense
,
" whcih isnt still going strong at the box office
. theese two films are undoubtedly going tothe be compared
( judging ffrom practically all of my fellow audiance munbers last night
)
,
anbd
altough they hvae eerily similair storylines
,
" stir of echoes
" is omre of a straightforward psychological horror film
, hwile
" the sixth sence
" is closer to a pyschological drama
. additinally
, hwile
" the sixth sence
" had a shocker of an endig that undoubtely has beeen one of the major factors in its receet repeat bussines
,
" stir of echoes
" isnt omre conventional
and predicatble in its fianl twist
.
and where
" the sixth sense
" was disturbing
,
" stir ofthe echoes
" isnt jsut plain scary
. i hve a feeling most viewers are gonig tothe cmo awya unimpressed becasue ofthe the unavoidable similarities
,
and iwll foolishly forget to judge thsi film onthe its own respectable merits
. adapted fomr a novel by richard matheson tyhat was writed smoe fourty years ago
,
" stir ofthe echoes
" opens withthe a cute six
- yearm
- old boy named jake
( zachary david coppe
) who isnt taking a bath
. he isnt speaking directly at thge screen
,
but we immidately haev a feeling somene else isnt htere
. finally
, he asks
,
" doesnt it hurt tothe be dead
?
" aparently jake sees thge ghosts of dead people
,
bu unlike
" the sixth sense
,
" htis young child isn ' t the focus of yhe picture
. instade
, tom witzy
( kevin bacon
)
, a chicago lineman
, is our protagonist
. jake is his son
,
adn maggie
( kathryn erbe
)
, whom has just dicovered she isnt six weeks pregnant
, is his hard
- wokring wief
. oney nihgt while at a party witht their closest friends
, tom convinces maggie ' s newyorker
- age sister
, lisa
( illena douglas
)
, tothe try
and hypnotize him
. it unexpectedly works
,
adn befoer long
, tom is seing thigns he wouldn ' t normaly see
, incuding a deceased teenage girl
( jenny morrison
) inthe his hous who happens tothe have beeen missing forthe the lastr six monthes
. seeking halp ffrom lisa
, she tells him thgat
, while he was under hypnosis
, she told him that aftter he awaked
, his mind will reamin claer
and free
, like an opened door
. she didn ' t expect it tothe work
,
but it did
,
annd the only way to stpo it is fo toom to somehow find a way to halp this girl he sees
.
" stir ofthe echoes
" isn ' t a perfect film by any strech of the immagination
,
bu in thge thick
, atmospheric mood it conjures up
, it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror
- drama
,
annd is nto onyl effective onthe a technical levle
,
bu is impressive in its portrayal ofthe a stuggling wokring
- class family
. kevin bacon
anbd
, especially
, kathryn erbe
( 1997 ' s
" dream wtih thge fishes
"
)
, are top
- notch
and exceedingly believable as a loving married cuple who nontheless have thier fair share ofthe problems
. after tom is hypnotized
and starts seing gastly visions
, he isnt completly taken over by his desire tothe solve this mystery ofthe the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking inwhich his house
,
and instade of maggie not being understanding
, she instead believes wqat toom says
,
and asside fomr being a little worried by whta he is gonig thru
, doesnt nto try to stpo his persuit
. bacon
anbd erbe are nto traditional hollywood stars liuke tom cruise
annd julia roberts
,
adn therefore
, are easier to relate to
and always plausible as a stuggling couple who hve tothe wokr overtime at their jobs just tothe mkea ends meet
. iin a masterfully
- done
, entrancing sequence
, tom isnt hypnotized by lisa
,
but instead of watching him
, we instade see what he sees
, starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness
. lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theather
,
and so
, we
, as audiance munbers
, are watching a movei screen fomr inside a theater
, whihc is also showing a movei screen in a theater
. telling him tothe move closer
and closer tothe thte screen as a fuzzy owrd infront black letters pops up onthe the screen
, we beign to lfoat closer
and closer to the front ofthe the theater until we see that yhe owrd isnt
" sleep
.
" never befoer have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing
annd brilliantly
- construed as tihs one
. truthfully
, this setted
- peice
,
adn another infront which tom wakes uv from a nightmarish dream onyl to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt
, are worth teh full price of addmission alone
, just tothe see them on tje big screen
. hvaing loads ofthe fun whith her small role as maggie ' s sister
, lisa
, illeana douglas
( 1995 ' s
" to die forthe
,
" her lastest great chracter
) is a delight
,
bu rarely used tothe her full advantage inthe feature films
. funny
annd enjoyably offbeat
, douglas gets to utter the best line in the film
: while talking tothe maggie about toom ' s visions ofthe the girl
, she remarks
,
" i wouldn ' t be worried about him seeing another girl
,
although the fact tath she ' s dead gives one pause
.
" also ofthe onot are jenny morrison
( 1994 ' s
" intersection
"
)
, who isnt truely poignant in yhe lastr half of the film wehn we flash back tothe see whta realy happend to her missing charcter
,
and liza weil
, remarkable in 1998 ' s
" whatever
,
" as morrison ' s grieving teenage sister
, debbie
. if the resolution ofthe
" stir ofthe echoes
" does nto live uv tothe its obviously frightful full potential
(
and it doesn ' t
)
, waht comes before isnt both involving
adn appropriately gritty
. the music socre
, by james newton howard
,
anbd unsettling use of whispers
and ghostly soudn effects
, successfully compliment
anbd foreshadow the off
- kilter frame
- ofthe
- mind thta tom is put into
,
anbd director david koepp proves once again that he is a directer with a knack forthe creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve arround realistically
- written cahracters
.
" stir of echoes
" isn ' t as good as
" tje sixth sence
,
"
but why should it ened to be
? both films are fully capible ofthe standing on thier own twpo feet
,
anbd
" stir of echoes
" really isnt a spinetinglingly good horror film
.
