the happy bastard ' s quick movei review me tarzan
.
.
. ytou hapyp viewer
. forthe a minute there
, i thought i was gogin tothe be groaning over the realease ofthe disney ' s latest
, another adaptions ofthe a legend fomr the past
.
( remeber the pathetic pocahontas
? yikes
!
)
but guess whta
- disney
, a comapany thyat ' s been on a roll lately with animated films
, strikes again whith another wonderfull tale that pleases tghe eyes as well as the intertube kid in you
. hte story is pretty basic
- tarzan is left orphaned
and a female gorilla who ' s lost her young adopts him into her gropu
. as he matures into a much older man
, tarzan still wonders just why he ' s so much different ffrom tjhe clan
,
anbd
then arrives a hunter
, a professer
,
and hte professor ' s lovely daughter
, jane
- who meets tarzan rather quickly affter getting in trouble wih a gropu of fiesty babboons
. from there
, tarzan faces tough choices
- shouldnt he stay withthe the ones taht he growed up with or go join his pwn kind inthe england
? tghe voicework here isnt preety top
- level
. tony goldwyn isnt vrey convincing as the ape man
; minnie driver adds a delectable touch tothe hte alread
- beatiful jane
; nigel hawthorne makse forthe a preety nasty hunter voice
; rosie o ' donnell keesh yhe laughs rolling as tarzan ' s best ape freind terk
;
annd wayne
" newman
" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant
. the movie isnt superb throughout
, mixing a great scirpt with incredable computer
- assisted visuals
. when tarzan tree
- surfs
( a twist that wass added onthe top ofthe teh smae ol ' vinyet swinging
-
anbd a great oney
, i might add
)
, hte camera twists
and turns
, allowing the trees all around tothe come to life vividly
. i couldn ' t belivee my eyes
- disney has cmo a long way since starting iin a ballroom for beauty
adn the beast
.
and tyhe music ' s nto half bad
, eather
. fortunatly
, there ' s noone rediculous singing cahracters here
, just a gerat set of songs by phil collins that perfectly ift the mood
. ther ' s soem great action sequences here as well
, including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan
, jane
,
annd the aforementioned babboons
.
bu
, ofthe course
, it ' s not all acation
- ther ' s a message here as well thgat has tothe do wiht familiy
. htis is easily oney ofthe disney ' s best animated films of the decade
adn it ' s oney i can ' t wait to put infront my hmeo libary
.
.
. thast is
, if my vcr still works inthe hte eyar 2000
