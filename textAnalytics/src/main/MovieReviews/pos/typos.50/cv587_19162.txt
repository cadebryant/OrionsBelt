) bu guess whta
- disney
, a comapany thyat
' s been onthe a roll lately with animated films
, strikes again witht another wonderful tale thast pleases the eyes as well as tyhe inner kid in you
. the stoyr isnt pretty basic
- tarzan is left orphaned
and a female gorilla who
' s lost her young adopts him inot her gropu
. as he matures inot a much older man
, tarzan still wonders jsut why he
' s so much different ffrom tghe clan
, annd hten arrives a hunter
, a profesor
,
and thte professor
' s lovley daugter
, jane
- who meets tarzan rether quicklyu after getting inthe trouble iwth a group of feisty babboons
. from there
, tarzan faces tough choices
- shoudl he stay wiht tjhe ones that he grew uv iwth or go join his own kind in engl
and
? tje voicework here is pretty top
- levle
. tony goldwyn isnt vyre convincing as the ape man
; minnie driver adds a delectable touch tothe tje already
- beautiful jane
; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice
; rosie o
' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan
' s best ape friend terk
; anbd wayne
" newman
" knight hasnt his moments as a panicky elephant
. tyhe movei isnt superb througout
, mixing a great script wiht incredible coputer
- assisted visuals
. whn tarzan tree
- surfs
( a twist that wass added on top ofthe tjhe smae ol
' vine swinging
-
and a great oen
, i might add
)
, teh camera twists adn turns
, alowing the trees all around to come to life vividly
. i couldn
' t believe my eyes
- disney hasnt come a long way sicne starting inthe a ballroom for beauty
and the byast
. adn yhe music
' s not half bad
, eather
. fortunately
, htere
' s noone ridiculous singing cahracters here
, just a grat setted ofthe songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood
. there
' s some gerat action sequences here as well
, incuding a wonderfully done chase between tarzan
, jane
, annd the aforementioned babboons
. bu
, of course
, it
' s not all acation
- there
