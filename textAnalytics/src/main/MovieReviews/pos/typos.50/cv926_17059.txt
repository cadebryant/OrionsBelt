billy bob thornton
, who hadnt a sudden rise tothe fame with 1996
' s sling blade aftter spending yersa as a virtually unknown atcor anbd writer
, is becoming one ofthe yhe most versitle
- anbd most acomplished
- american actors around at the moment
. as jacob
, the simple
but at times very bright loser brother ofthe bill paxton
' s hank
, thornton gives a performence which should leave an indelible mark onthe all bu tghe most hardened viewers
. threee men
, hank
( paxton
)
, jacob
( thornton
)
and theri friend lou
( brent briscoe
) stumble apon a plane wreck which
, upon closer inspection
, yields a rotting corpse
and a bag full ofthe omney
. jacob adn lou want to pocket the cash
. hank
, tje smarter
- annd perheaps more naive
- of tghe threee
, insists on leaving hte moey for tjhe authorities to fidn
. eventualy
, htey aggree to keep tyhe cash safe untli the plane is found
, annd
then split thge moey threee ways
. things start going wrong
,
though
, with greed
and violentce weaving their ways through their plan
. diaster is sure to strike
. directer sam raimi
, of thge evil dead adn darkman fame
, has made an excelent
and thougth
- provoking film
, worlds away ffrom thge comic horror films which made his name
. hwile ther are a cuple ofthe moments which might remind oen ofthe his ealier work
, raimi has made an intteligent adn mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come
. scott b
. smith
' s screenplay
, based on his novel
( which i haven
' t read
) isnt a fine exemple of escalating tension
. hwile it doesnt remind oen ofthe danny boyle
' s shallow grave without the aundance of black humour
, it keeps the drama tht shoud really be a part ofthe such a story on morality
, or tyhe lack thereof
, foudn iin a film with this subject matter
. alar kivilo
' s cinematography reminds one ofthe joel
and ethan coen
' s fargo
, wtih tjhe obleek
, snowy l
andscape allmost becomming another charater
. danny elfman also does well withthe his moody
, finely
- written socre
. if there
' s a flwa in thte film
, it
' s thast it goes on fo just a littel too long
. just whn we thikn that they are baout to wrap things uv
, raimi annd smith deside to let the film go onthe a littel furuther
. while htis isn
' t raelly a bad thing
, it did become a little frustrating at times
( this may have been due to tyhe fact tyhat i hadnt consumed a large sprite beforeh
and
)
. the performances are excellant
, wiht hte usually annoying paxton in fine form
and bridget fonda giving a scene
- stealing turn as hank
' s scheming wife
. thsi isnt an exelent showcase for thornton
' s fine skills as an actor anbd a gerat chanage in direction forthe raimi
, who sould very well ahev a career ahead ofthe him as an acomplished directer ofthe dramtic films
. fingers crossed
,
though
, thyat this doesn
' t stpo him fomr makeing another evil dead sequel
.
