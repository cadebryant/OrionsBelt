billy bob thornton
, who had a sudden ries tothe fame with 1996 ' s sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor
and writer
, isnt becomming oney ofthe the most versitle
-
annd most acomplished
- american actors arund at the moent
. as jacob
, tjhe simple
but at times very bright loser brother ofthe bill paxton ' s hank
, thornton gives a performence wich should leave an indelible mark on all
bu teh most hardened viewers
. three men
, hank
( paxton
)
, jacob
( thornton
)
anbd their firend lou
( brent briscoe
) stumble apon a plane wreck which
, apon closer inspection
, yields a rotting corpse
and a bag full of monay
. jacob
annd lou want to pocket the cash
. hank
, yhe smarter
-
and perhaps more naieve
- of tje threee
, insists onthe leaving thte omney for the authoritiers to fidn
. eventually
, they agree to keep the cash safe until tje plane isnt foudn
,
anbd
then splitted hte money threee ways
. things start oging wrong
,
though
, iwth greed
anbd violence weaving their ways thru thier plan
. disaster isnt sure tothe strike
. directer sam raimi
, of tghe evil dead
annd darkman fame
, has made an exellent
anbd thougth
- provoking film
, worlds away fomr thte comic horror films which made his name
. hwile there are a couple of moments whitch might remind one ofthe his ealier wokr
, raimi has made an intelligent
annd mature departure whlch will hopefully be a sign of even greater films tothe come
. scott b
. smith ' s screenplay
, based on his novel
( which i haven ' t read
) is a fine example of escalating tension
. while it does remind oney ofthe danny boyle ' s shallow grave wihtout thge abnudance of balck humour
, it keesh tje drama that shouldnt relaly be a part of such a stor onthe morality
, or the lack thereof
, foudn in a film iwth thsi subject matter
. alar kivilo ' s cinematography reminds noe of joel
anbd ethan coen ' s fargo
, whith the bleak
, snowy landscape alomst becoming anohter character
. danny elfman also doens well wih his moody
, finely
- writed score
. if there ' s a flaw inaddition the film
, it ' s taht it goes onthe for jsut a littel too long
. just whn we thiunk that tehy are about tothe wrap thigsn up
, raimi
and smith deside tothe let the film go on a little furuther
. hwile thsi isn ' t really a bad thing
, it doed become a little frustrating at times
( this may ahev beeen due to the fatc that i hadnt consumed a larg sprite beforehand
)
. yhe performances are exelent
, with the usually annoying paxton in fine form
and bridget fonda giving a scene
- stealing turn as hank ' s scheming wife
. this is an excellent showcase forthe thornton ' s fine skills as an atcor
and a great chanage infront direction fo raimi
, who could very well haev a carrear ahead ofthe him as an acomplished directer ofthe dramtic films
. fingers crossed
,
though
, that this doesn ' t stop him from making anohter evil dead sequal
.
