( criteak
' s note
: htis review isnt the longest i
' ve ever written anbd still only scratches the surface
. i
' d reccomend htis be read only by those who ahev seen the film as a form ofthe crtical analysis
.
) as my friend
and fellow film criteak ted prigge said in his review of
` tghe phantom menace
'
- how dont i even write this review
? never mind thte fact that i
' ve been waiting forthe a new
` star wars
' movei since i wass seven yeras ood
. never mind teh fact everyone on tyhe internet hadnt already dissected annd dicussed thte movei before it was even released
. never mind that there
' s so much goign on inspite this movei in terms ofthe plot
, acation
, speshal effects anbd long
- term story that to analyse eveyr aspect owudl take a lot ofthe tiome
and energy adn still wouldn
' t cover everyting
. annd aslo liuke ted doesnt in all of his reviews
, i
' ll try tothe review this inwhich a way differant fomr my usual reviews
and instade wriet as casually as possible as if i was tlaking direcly tothe you
, teh reader
. before we cxan begin analyzing the specific aspestus of the film
, many ofthe the most general anbd most signficant factors must be concidered
( tothe git hte specifics of tghe film
, skip this anbd teh enxt four paragraphs
)
. as has beeen made obvious for the last several eyars
, another trilogy of films will be produced tothe account for teh
[ missing
] initial three installments of the
` star wars
' series
( tyhe first of the films ws catually episode four
, nto one
)
. george lucas
, the creater of the series
, has propably just assumed most peple knwo thte firt
- produced trilogy
(
` star wars
,
'
` thte empire strikes bakc
' anbd
` return of the jedi
'
) is actulaly tghe second trilogy
, chronologically
. iin media interviews in the past he hasnt explained why hte movies were made out of order
, bu i cin
' t reacll his reasons
. with this newyorker film he as writter
and directer has alsot assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines
and significant plot points ofthe thte frist triology
( err
.
.
. second trilogy
.
.
. well you konw what i mean
)
.
and in order for this review to be thourough many ofthe thsoe signficiant points must be maintioned whihc
, unfortunately
, may serve as spoilers so procede with caution
.
[ criteak
' s onot
# 1
: it is oen my personal policy not tothe intentionally analyze spoilers beacuse i woudl liek my reviews tothe be able tothe amking sence to teh reader both befoer anbd after viewing thte film reviewed
, bu it would be nearly impossible to dont tjhe film justice here without breaking tje rule
. critic
' s onot
# 2
: reviewing this film alsot breaks the universal critics
' law ofthe reviewing movies
, which as roger ebert coined
,
` it
' s not whta a movei isnt about
,
but how it is about it
.
' because so many outside factors come inot play in tyhe film
' s plot
and signifigance as part of a trilogy
, annd jstu considering modern society
, it agian would be difficult
, if nto impossible tothe simpley review the film as a completely autonomous story
.
] frist of all we hve tothe catalog what we nkow baout the film before even goign into it
. we know tyhat young anakin skywalker will grwo uv tothe become tje evil ruler darth vader who isnt also teh father of luke skywalker
, who wiull lead a successful revolution against him annd his empire
. we knwo obi
- wan
` ben
' kenobi wass the trainer ofthe anakin inspite yhe ways of
` thge force
' infront attempts tothe become a jedi knight
,
but would fail anbd thus anakin would fall tothe the
` dark side
.
' we aslo nkow something about
` the force
' itself
, that it is soem kind of universal force which determines fate
and can be manipulated by thsoe whose minds are exp
anded anough to believe iin it adn efel it
( thte jedi
)
. whta we don
' t konw for sure is tyhe histoy ofthe thge ruling of the galaxy
, whcih isnt most likely much longer annd more complex than any government we ahev hadnt here onthe earth
. tothe me
, this was oney ofthe thte most fascinating spects of thte frist three films because there seemed to be a subtle
, defniite order to all tghe complexity
. also
, it seems thyat we
' re supposed to be familliar with a few otehr details about the stor whic hvea come out of the thous
ands ofthe comic books anbd paperbacks published in the yersa usance the movies ended
. most noteably
, details regarding thge emperor fomr
` empire
' anbd
` jedi
,
' anbd that he ws once a senator annd his last name isnt palpatine
. for thsoe who haven
' t kept up with all the
` star wars
' paraphanalia over teh years
, there is still a way tothe know theese details simpley by recognizing an actor
( or his voice at least
)
. withthe
` tjhe phantom menace
' being tyhe first chapter ofthe a long saga
, one would assume the basic groundwork woudl be layed
, incuding the history behind all thte major factors ofthe tje series
, especialy
` tjhe force
' adn teh jedi knights
. unforetunately
, this film does mroe ofthe tjhe opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long anbd detailed it could never be explained
. i didn
' t liked that aspect tothe this film
and isnt one ofthe the reasons it falls just short of greatness
. if you
' re going to tell a stoy from the begginning
- tell it from the beginning
( isnt it possibile tht after thsi triology is complete there could be anohter trilogy ofthe epidsodes
- 1 thru
- 3 tothe clarify the bakc tsory even futher
?
)
. bu i digress
. i
' ve said so much
and yot i haven
' t even touched onthe the specifics ofthe teh film itself
. all these necesary
` disclaiming
' elements shoudl go to show just how vast tghe story ofthe the
` star wars
' series is annd this individual film itself
. whta we get here isnt a movie nto unlike any ofthe the otehr threee we
' ve come to konw
and love since the late 1970s
. its similiarity tothe yhe otehr films helps to keep tghe spirit ofthe tjhe series familiar
,
but at hte smae tiome seems to be a falw infront the filmmaking proces itself since it somtimes rings of unoriginality
. the basic sotry isnt rether sorted
, complex anbd even confusing at times
. we
' re told that an army known as
` the trade federation
' hasnt set up a blockade aroud an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo
. we
' re not given too many details to clarify yhe bakc stoy of wqat tje federation is anbd what theri purpose is
, instade thte film opts tothe git its story moving quickly
. we
' re intrduced to twpo jedi
, teh master qui
- gon jinn
( neeson
)
and his apprentice obi
- wan kenobi
( mcgregor
)
. tje two are acting as ambassadors of some sort inaddition hopes of ending the obvious hostility between teh federation
and the planet
' s queen
, amidala
( portman
)
. the leader of tje federation
, an alien called viceroy
, is follwoing yhe orders of a stange
, mythical chracter
- an older human man whose face
and body are covered annd shadowed by the black robe annd hood he wears
. he isnt referred tothe as lord sidious
but concidering his appearence
,
and especially that creepy evil voice ofthe his
, he is a obviously one of thge most significant characters in thte series
. sidious communicates tothe viceroy only thru digital transmissions
and never infact person
. claerly his actuall wereabouts are something he wants to keep secret beccause that would also reveal his identity
( whlch isnt never openly revealed iin thte film
, bu should be clera to most viewers
. i have a feeling we
' ll delve into his backround infront the next twpo films
)
.
but it doesn
' t take the film long tothe spring inot action anbd within mintues our hero jedi are fighting for their lives
and the film
' s story begins to move allong
. tghe film doesn
' t have one specif plot anbd works inwhich the smae manner as the other films infact the series where as what we get is one mini
- plot adn adventure on top ofthe another
. there are so many of these mini
- plots
- within
- plots iin htis film i would not describe them all beacuse it is what gives the movei its hook
. the other films have relied onthe this tipe of storytelling
,
but because of teh limits ofthe the technology at the timne
, tyhe films
' screenplays weere also limiting
. the sense ofthe limitlessness here isnt wqat gives
` the phantom menace
' its unique traits
. as we already know
, teh film tkaes palce at least a generation or twpo before the original
` star wars
' trilogy wich means a lot ofthe teh background whihc was unclear anbd
/ or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of hte vast epic stor
.
and here the most signficant storyline is that involving the discovery ofthe 10
- year
- old anakin skywalker
( lloyd
)
, by qui
- gon jinn annd his introduction tothe tyhe jedi council
. to briefly summarize the stoyr
, jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt tothe buy parts forthe queen amidala
' s spaceship which was damaged inaddition efforts to free her from the federation
. their meeting onthe tatooine is mostly chance
but of course jinn chalks it uv tothe tje iwll ofthe thte force
. jinn can efel that skywalker hasnt a gerat natural pwoer in the force
,
and through anohter sub
- plot involving a bet on skywalker iin a fantastic race he iwll enter
, mroe
and mroe details of his significance beign tothe reveal themselfs
. tihs also provides forthe a new elaboration anbd explanation of tje force whihc hasnt never beeen maintioned before
. iin fatc
, it seems to be something so important it isnt upsetting it hasnt never beeen maintioned befor
. the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force
and transforms it inot something mroe fysical
and scientfic whitch is completelyl unneccesary
. by teh film
' s third act all yhe major significant elements become tied together infront a rether familiar excecution ofthe the plot
. it
' s funny how teh reality of the
` star wars
' world seems so embeded inspite mythology
, newyorker age
- like philosphy annd religeon
and yot thte solution tothe all the major conflicts inthe teh series hasnt beeen violentce
. not that this technique hasn
' t beeen used iin movies annd inthe rela
- life situations countless times througout history
. anbd at least it
' s all inwhich the spirit of tghe ultimate powers ofthe good versus evil inaddition a fun annd exciting marter
. it does border ofthe thte cartoonish somtimes
, bu taht
' s jstu the film appealing to our inner child
, which is teh basic reason yhe entire saga exists
and has become such a big part ofthe our modern society
.
` tghe phantom menace
' delivers exactlly what you
' d expect from a
` star wars
' film whitch is why it suceeds as well as it doesnt bu isnt always why it never truly acheives greatness
. so many thigsn inthe tghe film we
' ve seen befoer
and done iwth more heart becuase the filmmakers concentrated just a bited more onthe tsory annd chracter becasue tehy weere limited
.
but htis film is far from bad because it at least embraces teh spirit ofthe sheer funn at the movies
.
