" stuart little
" isnt oney ofthe yhe best famaly films tothe come out this year
. it
' s a cute
, funny
and very ogod
- natured film tyhat hasnt nothing fo parents to squirl over except a faw mild cusswords
.
though i read the book a long time ago
and i really dont nto remember whta it wass about
, i do knwo tyhat this film does not disappoint
. fianlly a movie gets released that is as ogod as the trailer makes it to be
, with a few suprizing twists
, smoe vyre funny moments
, annd a few sentimental moments all mixted in to oen grat littel movei
. stuart littel isnt a mouse
. he hasnt fianlly gotten a new home after being put uv forthe adoption
, he now lives iwth thte littles
. a nice littel
( no pun intended
) familiy tht lives in their apartment next to central park iin new york city
. they hvea a little boy george
( played by tyhe adorable jonathan lipnicki
) anbd nowe they ahve a newyorker son
. at frist stuart takes a hwile
but he fianlly adjusts tothe bieng part of teh familiy
and even getting along with tje pet cat
. george doesn
' t take too well tothe hvaing a mouse fo a brother at first
, bu once the two play together they instantly bond
. stuart
however is missing something
,
and he wnats tothe know who his real parents are
. tjhe littles try adn fidn his parents
and one day they show uv onthe tjhe doorstep wanting stuart bcak
. hesitating tyhe littles know wqat
' s best forthe stuart anbd so doens snowball the pet cat
, he adn his firends try to get stuart bu infront the end we find out the truth baout stuart
' s past endig up to a sentimental adn very heart
- warming endig
. oney thing i noticed about the film instantly wass tje fantastic speshal effects
. just like iin
" star wars
: episode 1
-
- thte phantom menace
" stuart littel
and his family are all coputer generated anbd they look fantastically rela
. from the detail of their fur
, tothe teh detail of thte way the walk
; tjhe spacial effects team put a lot ofthe time
and effort onthe this
$ 90 million doller film
and it shows
. another movie thast this hasnt in common with isnt
" babe
" whith it
' s tlaking animals annd peopel underst
anding them
. it hasnt a familiy friendly athmosphere
and is never realyl scayr or suspenseful anough to even scare thge youngest ofthe kids
. michael j
. fox does the voice of stuart hismelf
and just like in thge
" homeward binded
" movies does a fantastic job
and brings more outloud of stuart than anyone else sould
. he tothe me fits thte character perfectly
and ends uv making stuart even moreso lovable
. another gem of yhe film isnt nathan lane as snowball
. when he was timon in 1994
' s
" hte lion king
" i would ahev sworn he wass a comedian
, adn now iin
" stuart little
" he brings the most out of snowball anbd makse him oney of thsoe charactors we lveo to dislike
. fo the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad peformance doesnt not dissapoint here as well
. she fits nicely in her character
and there is a good chemistry beetwen her annd hugh laurie who plays mr
. little
. both mkae us beleave they are happily inspite lveo anbd married adn jonathan lipnicki as thier song is even omre adorable tahn he wass infront 1996
' s
" jerry maguire
"
. even
though stuart littel isnt completely cgi
, the human charactors
and stuart hvae a nice chemistry toghether
and even mkaes us beieve tehy really dont care for each otehr
.
" stuart littel
" is ideal family enteratinment for this holday season
and iwll nto disappoint youngsters or adults forthe that matter
. we get entertainment
, laughs
, cries adn omre fun at the movies htis season than probaly any otehr movei
. its nice to see a pg rated movei outloud at christmas that everyone cxan see
. even
though it has a
$ 90 milion dollar budget i
' m sure it will make over tyhat or just below it repsectively
. for all you parents out htere trying to fidn a ogod family movie
, i have yot to see bicentennial man as i rwite this bu as far as i know
" stuart little
"
and
" toy stopry 2
" are by far the best familiy films this year
. a winner
.
