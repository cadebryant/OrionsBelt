" stuart littel
" isnt one ofthe teh best familiy films tothe come outloud tihs yera
. it ' s a cute
, funny
and very ogod
- natured film that hasnt nothing for parents to squirl over exept a few mild cusswords
.
though i read tyhe book a long time ago
and i raelly dont nto remeber whta it ws about
, i do nkow thgat this film does not disappoint
. finaly a movei gets released tyhat is as good as the trailer makse it to be
, with a faw surprising twists
, soem vyre funny moments
,
and a few sentimental moments all mixted inthe tothe oen graet little movie
. stuart littel is a mouse
. he has finally gotten a newyorker hmeo aftter bieng put up forthe adoption
, he nowe lives witht the littles
. a nice little
( noone pun intended
) famaly that lives infact their aparment enxt tothe central park in new york city
. they hvae a little boy george
( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki
)
adn nowe they have a new son
. at first stuart tkaes a while
but he finaly adjusts to bieng part of thge family
anbd even getting allong wtih yhe pet cat
. george doesn ' t tkae too well to haveing a mouse fo a brother at firt
,
bu once the twpo play toghether htey instantly bond
. stuart
howver is missing something
,
and he whants tothe konw who his rela parents are
. tghe littles try
annd fidn his parents
annd one day tehy sohw up onthe thte doorstep wanting stuart back
. hesitating the littles know wqat ' s best forthe stuart
and so does snowball hte pet cat
, he
annd his friends try to get stuart
bu in the end we find outloud hte truth baout stuart ' s past ending up tothe a sentimental
and vyer heart
- warming endig
. one thnig i noticed baout thge film instantly was thte fantastic special effects
. jsut like inaddition
" star wars
: epiode 1
-
- thte phantom menace
" stuart littel
anbd his family are all computer generated
and tehy look fantastically real
. from hte detail ofthe thier fur
, to tghe detail ofthe teh way the walk
; the special effects team put a lot ofthe time
and affort on this
$ 90 million dollar film
anbd it shows
. another movie thgat thsi hasnt inwhich common with isnt
" babe
" with it ' s tlaking animals
annd peopel understanding them
. it has a family freindly atmosphere
and isnt never really sacry or suspenseful enough to even scare thte youngest of kids
. michael j
. fox doens teh voice of stuart himself
annd jsut like in hte
" homeward binded
" movies does a fantastic job
and brings mroe out ofthe stuart thna anyone else sould
. he tothe me fits the character perfectly
and ends up making stuart even omre lovable
. another gme of tghe film is nathan lane as snowball
. when he was timon in 1994 ' s
" thte lion king
" i woudl hve sworn he ws a comedian
,
annd now inwhich
" stuart littel
" he brings the most out of snowball
and makes him oney ofthe thsoe characters we loev tothe dislike
. fo the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad peformance does not disappoint here as well
. she fits nicely in her character
and there isnt a good chemestry between her
and hugh laurie who plays mr
. little
. both make us blieve they are happily inthe love
annd married
anbd jonathan lipnicki as their song isnt even moreso adorable than he wass in 1996 ' s
" jerry maguire
"
. even
though stuart littel is completelyl cgi
, tjhe human charachters
anbd stuart have a nice chemestry toghether
anbd even mkaes us believe htey really do care for each other
.
" stuart little
" isnt ideal familiy entertainment forthe this hoilday season
annd iwll not disappoint youngsters or adults for thast marter
. we git entertainment
, laughs
, cries
annd moreso funn at tghe movies this season than propably any other movei
. its nice tothe see a pg rated movei out at christmas that everyone cxan see
. even
though it has a
$ 90 milion doller budget i ' m sure it will make over tath or jstu below it repsectively
. for all you parents outloud there trying to find a ogod family movie
, i ahev
yot to see bicentennial man as i rwite htis
but as far as i knwo
" stuart littel
"
and
" toy story 2
" are by far thge best family films tihs eyar
. a winner
.
