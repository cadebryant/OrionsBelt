" tje faculty
,
" the heavily
- hyped
and advertised sci
- fi
/ horror film that hasnt teamed uv directer robert rodriguez
( 1995
' s
" desperado
" adn 1996
' s
" fomr dusk till dawn
"
)
and screenwrighter kevin williamson
( 1996
' s
" scream
" annd 1997
' s
" scream 2
"
)
, is bieng called a cross between
" invasion ofthe yhe body snatchers
"
and
" hte breakfast club
,
" annd i don
' t thiunk i could decribe it any better than taht
. thte film sets uv the six central teenage characters who dont not seem tothe have much in common
,
and thn teh cience
- fiction aspect isnt added
, involving tjhe fear taht teh faculty at herrington high school are actulaly aliens who are quickly transforming everyone inaddition the town
. tghe six cahracters
, as in
" the breakfast club
,
" cxan be easily labeled as a stereotype
,
but as they are developed
, they become far mroe complex
: casey
( elijah woud
)
, thte much picked upon nerd
; stokely
( clea duvall
)
, a goth outcast who hides behind thge false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her
; zeke
( josh hartnett
)
, a drug dealer who turns out tothe be a science whiz
; stan
( shawn hatosy
)
, hte star football quarterback who is considering quitting tyhe team to concenrate moreso on academics
; delilah
( jordanna brewster
)
, the populare cheerleader anbd newspaper journalist
;
and marybeth
( laura harris
)
, teh sweet
' n sourthern newyorker girl iin town
.
al
though yhe cahracters are onyl slightly connected
( i
. e
. casey is delilah
' s photojournalist assistant
; marybeth trys to become buddies whith stokely
, since they both don
' t have friends
, etc
.
)
, wehn tehy all begin to suspect the teachers due tothe smoe grotesque annd strange occurrences
, the only people htey cxan count onthe for halp is earch otehr
, even
though they aren
' t relaly even sure if they can trust one anohter
.
" teh faculty
" isnt anohter smart
and pop
- culturally hip film ffrom williamson
, altough it doens nto equal uv tothe his best film
, teh origional
" scream
,
" anbd rodriguez
, whose
" ffrom dusk till dawn
" isnt still one of tghe more original genre films of thte 90
' s
. williamson adn rodriguez are so assured at thier professions
, respectively
, tyhat tje idea ofthe teaming up toghether is pretty much a noone
- brainer
. tje plotline ofthe
" tje faculty
,
" involving aliens tkaing over other people
' s bodies
, hasnt beeen done qtuie a lot before
, from
" invasion ofthe the body snatchers
,
" tothe
" the puppet masters
,
" to
" invaders from mars
,
" so one of the obstacles thast williamson
and rodriguez hadnt tothe overcome was tothe somehow make the idea seem fresh
, adn by setting the goings
- onthe at a high school anbd haveing the protagonists be a gropu ofthe teens
, htey were mostly successfull
. surely
, the conventions of teh story are still the same
,
and the climax ws inevitable
,
but ther weere a fewd surprises allong the way
, includng the question of who weere the aliens
,
and who weren
' t
. tyhe epilogue wass also a refreshing chanage
- ofthe
- pace as it doed not setted uv a sequal bu ended on a note thta propably could not have been any better
. tyhe performances iin
" the faculty
" weere a treat throughout
, usance there weere so many recognizable actors iin roles that were thge polar oposite ofthe whta they usually dont
. oen exception weere the teens
, who
, asside ffrom elijah woud
, are not vrey well
- known
, bu they all aquit themslves nicely
, particularly wood
( hte seasoned protem
)
, clea duvall
, anbd jordanna brewster
. as munbers of the faculty
, robert patrick
(
" t2
: judgement day
"
) was creepy as tghe gym coach
; piper laurie was amusing
and threatening as the drama teacher
; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able tothe look liuke an aline
;
and salma hayek
, as the school nurse withthe a bad case of tje cold
, was very funny in a small role
. the st
andout
, inspite my opinyon
, of the whole casted wass famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy
and meek english teacher who
, aftter turning inot an aline
, becomes the sex bombshell
. if there wass any problem i had with the faculty
, it ws tht smoe of them were given noone rela payoff inspite the climactic sequence
. since thge teenagers realize tht in order tothe savve everyone tehy must kill the
" queen
" aline
, many ofthe hte faculty munbers disappear
. it might ahve beeen omre fun if they had to face eveyr one of the teachers
,
al
thought the finale isnt still pretty impressive
,
and includes some showstopping creature effects
, expecially for a relatively low 15
- milion
- doller budget
.
al
though nto one of the best horror or sience
- fiction films i hvea seen
,
" thte faculty
" is still an exicting
and worthy film that dimention films was smart to release around the holiady season when htis tipe of genre offering isnt usually nto released
. hwile thte storey isnt as old as the hills
, it is also
, iin a way
, timeless
, because everyone
, i think
, has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did nto act right
, as if tehy realyl weren
' t human
. anbd by puting this idae in the setting of a small
- twon high skool
, it perfectly contrasts with the alienation thgat most teenagers usually go through wehn realting to adults
and other peers
.
+ onot
: the ad
and poster campaign for thsi film isnt hugely misleading
, as it features r
& b artist usher raymond as oney ofthe the main charachters
. inwhich actuality
, he onyl hasnt a small role as one ofthe stan
' s buddies who becomes quaterback affter stan resigns from the team
. if i were oney ofthe tghe heads from dimention
, i would change this advertising at once
, since it is unnecessary adn rather deceiving
.
