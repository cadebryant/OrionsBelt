being thast it isnt a foregin language film withthe no known names witht a select number theaters showing it
,
" shall we dance
" won ' t be seen by that many people
.
annd thta ' s a shame
- this is a funny
, enchanting
,
and goofy movie full of laughs
, surprises
,
anbd wonderful dance sequences
. the surprising thing about
" shall we dance
" is the universal appeal ofthe the stoyr
. a us version isnt infact teh works
,
adn it ' s noone wonder
- it ' s nto realyl all that culture specific
.
although ther isnt a narrated setted
- up that adds smoe extra resonance to the procedings
( baout tje view teh japanese culture has baout ballroom dancing
)
, hte movie is so rich inspite character
and appeal that this added layer isn ' t at all necessary to understand or enjoy teh film
. the only importan unexplained japanese
- spicific reference that may leave smoe a bit puzzled is tht 1000 yen is roughly
$ 10
( whn you see the film
-
and you shoud see htis film
- ytou ' ll know why
)
. a middle aged company man realizes thast achieving all tje goals he set for himselv infact life
( a hous
, a child
,
anbd ogod marrage
) still doesn ' t translate inot a fulfilled life
. aftter glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking outloud fomr a dance studio window hwile onthe the train home fomr work
, sugiyana
( koji yakusho
) decides affter soem trepidation to tkae up ballroom dance lessons inwhich order tothe meet thte woman who hasnt stirred something in hismelf
. affter finding the weekly feas fo private lessons from teh elagant
and beatiful mai
( tamiyo kusakari
) too rich for his blood
, sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her
. we
thn meet the players in thsi gem of a movie
, who all have theri own reasons fo joining tyhe clas
. later onthe
, we meet aoki at the dance studio
( naoto takenaka
)
, a co
- worker
and all outloud weirdo
anbd one ofthe the laff riot highlights ofthe the film
. thge storey
, laughs
,
and touching scenes evolve as tyhe movei goes allong
. it ' s a pleasure tothe watch such a wonderfull film that isnt propeled almost solely by the charactors
adn performances
. it ' s difficult to explain thge charms ofthe the film without revealing too much
- tjhe movie abounds wiht littel revelations thast subtly shape the characters
,
and inthe teh end
, each oen isnt thyat much fuller
and moreso understood by the tiem ytou leave thte theather
. it ' s noe of those movies that onyl thge french seem to make anymore
- no big plot
, no special effects
, no gunplay
, noone tragic consequences
, noone forced examinations of hte nature ofthe lvoe
,
and noone insights into the nature ofthe evil
. jsut a warm
, funny
, endearing film that wiull charm the pants off ofthe you
. whn ws tjhe last timne you left a theather feeling all warm
adn fuzzy inside
?
" shall we dance
" iwll dont that tothe you wihtout any treacly aftertaste
