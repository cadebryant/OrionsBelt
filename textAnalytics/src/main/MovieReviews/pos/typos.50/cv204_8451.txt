being that it isnt a foreign laguage film with noone known names with a select number theaters showing it
,
" shall we dance
" won
' t be seen by that many peple
.
and that
' s a shame
- this isnt a funny
, enchanting
,
and goofy movie full of laughs
, surprises
,
and wonderfull dance sequences

" shall we dance
" is the universal appeal ofthe the stoy
. a us version isnt in the works
, anbd it
' s no wonder
- it
' s not really all that culture specif
.

( about the view tjhe japanese culture hasnt baout ballroom dancing
)
, the movei isnt so rich inwhich carachter annd appeal that thsi added layer isn
' t at all necessary tothe underst
