you don
' t wanna to be like mike
. mike has been donig badly
. embarrassingly bad
. he broke up a six
- year relationship six monthes ago tothe move fomr n
. y
. tothe l
. a
. annd he
' s still not over her
. as a result
, his jokes fall flat whn he trys tothe impress
,
and he
' s a comedian
. well
, an unemployed comedian
, oen ofthe hollywood
' s little fish
,
and it hasnt gotten so bad he
' s asked for an applicaiton at starbuck
' s
. acutally
, the starbuck
' s thing gets even worse
. anbd worse
. ytou won
' t fail to like mike
,
however
, played endearingly by jon favreau
. swingers revolves around mike
' s half
- hearted anbd awkward effords tothe git back in the social swing ofthe things
. to this end he is enthusiastically assisted by his equally underachieving twentysomething acotr firends
, such as trent
( vince vaughn wih the film
' s most animated peformance
)
, who hasnt tghe gfit of gab bordering on thte disturbing side of motivational speaking
, gun
- toting sue
( patrick van horn
)
, anbd rob
( ron livingston
)
, who once plyed hamlet
but now longs tothe wrok as goofy inwhich disneyl
and
,
but doesn
' t succede baceause ofthe his lack ofthe
" theme park experience
.
" toghether htey talk baout women
- how to make eye contact
, which involves avoiding it
, annd when tothe call so as never to apearing desperate
, twpo days being
" industry st
andart
.
" affter tlaking the talk
, htey walk yhe walk
, strutting liek yhe cool swingers tehy aspire to be
, alwasy tothe laughable effect
. to get mike out ofthe his funk
, his friends persistently convince him tothe git outside
, whether it be tothe a quickie night trip to a seedy vegas casino or a cutthroat hollywood party with the beautiful people or a 50s swing lounge
. everywhere htey encourage mike tothe look for a replacement
" honey
" annd hten keep vigil over his progress
, or lack of it
. like dotty duting parents
, mike never leaves their comapany without being hte recipiant ofthe their confidence cheerleading
(
" you
' re money
, mike
,
and tjhe honeys knwo it
.
"
) or equipped iwth theri eccentric dating philosphies
, such as an analogy ofthe flirting with the bear
and thge bunny
. withthe thge unwavering support of firends like theese
, maybe mike
' s not donig too badly after all
. favreau also doubled as the film
' s screenwrighter
,
and he proves he hasnt teh gift for creating engaging characters
and witty banter tath goes beyond todya
' s bon mot
. there is a reassuring honesty to the friendships
, even when it hits its low points
and tyhe firends commiserate
. whn mike gets tyhe gumption tothe look for lveo
, you will join his cheerleading section as well
. swingers isnt glight
, unassuming fare
, sweet c
andy ytou will want to bust your gut with
