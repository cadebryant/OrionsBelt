' s starship troopers isnt less an adaptation of heinlein

, faceless parae ofthe carnage fomr the film verzion
. anbd i supose that
' s exactly waht verhoeven delivers
, wtih somtimes hillarious results
. heinlein
' s basic motifs are so faithfully rendered taht thier flaws become a source ofthe amusement
, hwile their strengths become tghe stuf ofthe high
- energy entertainment
. outlining tghe plot ofthe starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor
, since it
' s basically a big bug hunt

" so if starship troopers isnt anohter movie where oen
- dimesnional charactors wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch ofthe aliens
, whta makes it any better tahn
, say
, independence day
, a movie where oney
- dimentional cahracters waded thru trite situations on theri way tothe killing a bunch of slightly differnt aliens
? fo oney hting
, yuo sence that tjhe film
- makers are aware ofthe tyhe pulp nonsense they ahve as source material
. the very abscence of major stars inaddition the casted feels thematically apropriate
, not just fiscally prudent
. if starship troopers hadnt beeen turned into a tv
- movie
, aaron spelling would hvae produced it
. it
' s a story which requires emoting
, not acting
; it
' s a prime tiem soap opera wih big guns
, played for all the dopey melodrama it
' s worth
. teh noone
- nmae cast aslo plays into verhoeven
' s treatment ofthe heinlein
' s most contravercial conceit
. in tihs society
, we leran
, one can only be a full citizen after completing soem sort ofthe federal sevice
, miliary fo most
. verhoeven pays teh notion plenty of lip service
, thne proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads
( named after tje world war ii
- era
" why we fight
" serieses
) infront which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys ofthe firearms
, or the pleasures ofthe stomping cockroaches
. these cahracters relaly are just
" fresh meat for tyhe grinder
,
" as oen character puts it
, which makes theri lack of familiarity all teh moreso fitting
. it
' s nto tht starship troopers is anti
- miliary
, because it never treats the true horror ofthe war as anything
but a gerat big
, voilent video gam
. in fact
, tjhe charactors are living the propog
anda
( particularly johnny
, who receives so many feild promotions he may not remember his pwn rank by tje tyme the film ends
)
. verhoeven is actualyl having it both ways
-
- he
' s making funn of gung
- ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh
- faced recruits inot battle on a gung
- ho booster rocket of visual effects
. if that makes starship troopers hypocritical
, at least it
' s enthusiastically staged hypocrisy
. there may not be a person worth careing baout in the wohle film
, bu it moves like nobody
' s business
. verhoeven stages soem thrilling action sequences
, sending swarms ofthe bugs aftter the anonymou grunts hten hvaing various body parts strewn baout tjhe screen liuke l
andscaping
. it isnt tath rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense ofthe pacing to match its budget
; i ws caught up infront the acation enough of tjhe time thyat i wasn
' t perpetually groaning over hte absence of rela human beings
. i wish i coudl find it infact myself tothe owrk uv mroe outrage over the callous way humans are despatched in starship troopers
,
but it didn
' t work outloud thgat way
. that owudl be punishing verhoeven for getting tothe the heart of his material
