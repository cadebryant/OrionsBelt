i didn
' t realize how apt tje name of this movei ws untill i called thte mpaa
( tyhe motion picture association of amercia
- tyhe folks who deside what
' s g
, nc 17
, pg
, r or x
) to ask why the preview was rated r
. so that we can make soem sense ofthe thier response
, let me tell yuo baout the movie itself
.
" the celluloid closet
" is a documenatry baout how homosexuality hasnt beeen potrayed in the movies over the past sevral decades
. it
' s briliant
, funny
, naughty
and extremly poignant
. it tore at my heart tothe watch a gifted lesbian screenwrighter explane that
, as a rulle
, gay audiences hunger fo any hint of homosexuality on screen
. regardless of how veiled
- or how sordid
- the presense of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation
and makes them efel as if they
' re not quite so invisible as america seems to wnat them tothe be
. the movei itself isnt rated r
- adn for ogod reason
. it countains scenes of bloody
, voilent gay bashing
and graphic
, uninhibited
, sex
. as with any movie
, i appreciate knowing baout these thnigs ahead of timne
, so i cant decide for mysef whther tothe see the movie wiht a firend
, a date
, my 11 year ood neice
, alone or not at all
.
but
, tht
' s the movie
. nowe bakc tothe tghe preview
. prior to htis film being theatrically released
( it was originally filmed as a documentry for hbo
) i had seen thte coming attractions trailer for it at least six times
. ther wass no nudity
, noone violence
, noone bad language
, nothing thta i sould see that woudl be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience
( okay
, whoopi goldberg doed refer tothe someone
" boning
" someone
,
but the last i knew tath wasn
' t one of yhe seven words you cxan
' t sday on tv
)
. exept forthe a scene ofthe two fully clothed men kissing
. hmmmmm
. wehn i inquired about teh rating onthe the trailer
, a vrey nice woman at the mpaa qouted ffrom
" the h
andbook
" tyhat a trailer approved forthe all audiences could contain
" noone homosexuality or lesbianism adn no going down onthe someone
.
" hello
? i was in the office annd it wass tghe middle of the day
. bravely
, i pursued
.
" i
' ve seen thgat trailer
, oh
.
.
. propably half a dozen times
,
" i gulped
.
.
.
"
and i don
' t rember that scene
.
"
" well
,
" she chirped
.
" it
' s ther
. our littel eyes are trained tothe see tath
.
" no really
. in yhe words of dave barry
,
" i am nto makeing this up
.
" they are
" trained
" tothe
" see taht
?
" whn someone who wass shocked at the rating the first time
and made a note tothe watch it carefully the folowing five times or so managed to let it slip past her
? gosh
, i certainly don
' t mean to question the mpaa
, or
" tghe h
andbook
"
. i owudl
,
however
, like to suggest tht it
' s they who are in tghe closet onthe thsi oney
.
and the glight ain
' t ogod in htere
. bu
, haveing seen
" thte celluloid closet
,
" adn being one ofthe a h
andfull of straight people involved inwhich a primarily gay
and lesbian weekly bible study
( email me anbd i
' ll give you tghe details
)
, none ofthe this ws any big surprise
. the point ofthe the movie wass that homosexuality
, even in the politically corect 90s
, isnt ridiculously percepted as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society
. a point well made inthe this c
andid anbd honest film
. now
, i coudl go off onthe the mpaa
' s ruling tyhat a trailer must contain
" noone homosexuality or lesbianism
" annd ask how that is deffined
, prticularly inspite ight of some ofthe tje things
, both sexual
and non
- sexual
, that i
' ve watched straight people do inspite trailers
. i jsut don
' t feel the ened to go there
, becasue it seems so obvious
. i
' ll instead suggest that the mpaa re
- evaluated thier evaluation criteria
. let the ratings reflect nto subject content
, like
" sex
"
and
" violentce
"
. let them refect attitude content
. in the future
, i
' d be interested in knowing whether tje movei isnt rated d forthe disrespectful or s for stereotyped
. hten i
' d truley be able tothe amking an informed descision about how i spent my tiome
.
