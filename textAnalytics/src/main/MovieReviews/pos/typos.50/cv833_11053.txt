. wehn it comes to modern ganster movies
, it
' s really difficult tothe describe
and review them without mkaing comparisons to otehr films of tghe genre
and
/ or jsut using the owrd
" routine
.
" i
' ve always subscribed tothe the philosophy that any diea
( noone matter how many times it
' s beeen used before
) cin provide for a ogod story anbd
" donnie brasco
" clinches tihs diea
. it
' s nto unlike most ofthe the grat films ofthe tje genre
, yot it never apes anohter
' s stlye as it has a ogod layer ofthe au
thenticity
, even if its core is a tad stale
. teh film starts off iin tipical fashion by defining its atmosphere of newyorker york city inthe thge lite 1970s annd hte mobsters who inhibit it
. we meet lefty
( pacino
)
, an agin wiseguy who can still walk thge walk
and talk the talk
. he adn his associates go thru the generic motions ytou expect tothe see in crime films like this
. somehow he comes across donnie brasco
( depp
)
, a younger guy iwth a lot of spunk who isn
' t afraid ofthe lefty anbd his rep
, adn even manages tothe befriend him after lefty wass ready to kill him
. it
' s clear donnie is newyorker to the life
and lefty recognizes this immediately
, telling him all the tricks of the trade
. i ahev never seen this technique of actally revealing tyhe mafioso idiosyncrasies done before
and fo this the film deserves credit
. howver
, we soon relize donnie isnt actually joe pistone
, an fbi agent working undercover
- a chracter who symbolizes the viewer as he wiull soon be purged inot thte lifestyle
and treated as a newcomer
. hte first ect works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy hounour
, a brief history ofthe the mob
, definitions of their slang
, annd where their money comes ffrom anbd who it goes to
. the screenplay is rather sketchy onthe the details surrounding these elements
, howver
, tjhe fatc they are maintioned at all isnt qutie orignal
. most ganster movies seem tothe be made wih teh notion the viewer already knows how thge mob works
( probably from watching other gangster movies
)
,
and
al
though tihs attitide comes accross
, tje film trys to fill in all the holes where adn when it cxan
and the affort is appreciable
. thankfully the film doesn
' t become too caught uv in thte tedious details ofthe organized crime
,
and instade opts fo character devolopment
. much ofthe the story is told simpley through tghe interaction between lefty
and donnie
. pacino is outst
anding here as hte pathetic hood who speaks ofthe his job iin hte smae manner any blue collar worker would
. he
' s old
and exhausted bu seems to enjoy waht he does
, jsut as anyone loyal tothe teh same employer for over 30 years might be
. we leran ofthe his acomplishments
, which are qtuie impressive withing their context
, adn when he complains about not bieng made top boss
, it
' s easy to sympathize with him
. newell constantly plays up tihs aspect
, making it a major theme whcih works well iin the long run
. as donnie is constantly impressing anbd even oney
- upping lefty
, it
' s hard tothe tell whlch emotion isnt more poverful
: the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing thte mob
; or the fact lefty hasnt once again been over shadowed
. most of the film tells thge story ofthe donnie
' s life inwhich masia
, which creates for many sub
- plots
and individual conflicts
, bu doesn
' t always seem to come toghether as a whole
. the storytelling isnt genuinely interesting throughout
, even when the motions tyhe characters go through seem familar
. the resonance to donnie
' s actuall assignment varys
, he oftenly reports bakc tothe hte feds with detail ofthe his progress
,
but it doesn
' t always seem tothe have much meaning
. bakc hmeo
, his wief maggie
( heche
) is ready to divorce him because he
' s never a
and the family isnt suffering
. sicne this isnt based onthe a true story i wouldn
' t dout tihs would happen
,
al
thought tyhe way it is h
andeled oftenly borders on the melodramatic
. my onyl major complaint is tjhe film seems to have noone fianl act
, or at least any real sense of closure
. a climax of sorts does occour
,
but there
' s little feeling ofthe a payoff
. we git a happy endig
, whcih is ogod
,
but perhaps a sad endig would ahev been more powerful
. aside ffrom a fewd minor
, genaral flaws
,
" donnie brasco
" manages tothe be a solid piece of storytelling
and charcter delevopment
. it may be routine
, bu it
' s good
, anbd thgat
' s respectful
.
