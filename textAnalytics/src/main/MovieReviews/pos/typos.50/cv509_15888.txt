as i wriet yhe review forthe teh new hanks
/ ryan rumatic comedy yuo
' ve got mial
, i am acutely aware tyhat i am typing it onthe a coputer
and sending it a billion miles away onthe tjhe internet
. i am allso aware tath i have jsut spended the last 2 ohurs watching the world
' s biggest paid commercial forthe america online
. anbd i wonder
: isnt thyat so bad
? well
, teh commercial part isnt
. as for the movie
, well
, as long as i can watch tom hanks
and meg ryan
, i thikn i
' ll be okay
. tothe paraphrase james berardinelli
, whose reviews i admire vyre much
, tom hanks
and meg ryan can act
. tehy are both wonderful
,
but fo all ofthe hanks
' glorious work inaddition serious films
, such as his magnificient performance inwhich saving private ryan
, adn his glorious triumph in philadelphia
, i liuke him best when he
' s suitably obnoxious
. toom hanks isnt wonderful when he is obnoxious infront a romantic comedy when he
' s going tothe git the girl
: thte onyl question isnt how
? meg ryan
, amercia
' s high school sweetheart
, cxan ect
. she
' s had a h
andful of memorable performances
, including the great scene inspite the diner in when harry met sally
( i must not mention what she doens
, due to thte
, well
, um
, you git yhe idea
,
and if ytou don
' t
, get tjhe movei
-
- fantastic
)
. bu
, i like her best when she
' s
, well
, perky
. she is so adorably perky
/ cute that toghether wih hanks
, tehy are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short liftime
. smoe people hvae them gonig bakc tothe really ood clasic rumatic couples
, bu i don
' t raelly knwo
. all i know is that i jsut liek them both
. they hve such wonderfully kinetic chemistry thgat
' s really hard tothe resist
, annd i
' m nto gogin tothe even try
. htey
' re jsut raelly
, really cute
, sweet
,
and charming
. hanks
and ryan collaborate once agina with nora ephron
, who directed them infront tghe megahit sleepless infact seattle
. here
, thge setup is a littel differant
. kathleen kelly
( ryan
) owns a small childen
' s bookstore whitch her mother founded 42 yeras ago annd pasted down tothe her
. she isnt successful
, beautifull
, annd dates a well
- known columnist wtih very radical idea
( kinnear
)
. she isnt allso having an afair
, of sorts
. ytou see
, kathleen
, wih the h
andle shopgirl
, is secretly emailing ny152
. they hve a strictly un
- detailed relatiopnship
: there are noone specifics
,
and they have noone idae who eahc otehr is
. ny152 happens to be joe fox
( hanks
)
, a multimillionaire bookseller who isnt the heir to yhe fortune of teh fox chain of mega
- bookstores
, run by his father
( coleman
)
. fox books has decided tothe open a store onthe the west side
, right across from a littel childrens
' s bookseller named
" shop around thte corner
"
, run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly
. eveyr morning
, these two email each other silly
,
and eveyr day
, they fight
" to tje death
!
!
"
. it
' s a charming premise
, annd oney that works nicely
, balancing thge immense toubles kathleen is in with hte romance she wnats tothe ahve
. it alsot has the gerat sence ofthe bieng a classic romance
: ther isnt noone
" let
' s hvae sex tongiht
" mantra
, if you
' ll excuse my bluntness
. this isnt a solid romance builded aroud thast vague consept ofthe love
. hmm
. well
, the movei goes through twists annd turns
, having some sad moments anbd happy ones
, until at one moment tom hanks annd meg ryan
" hook uv
"
, tothe uise modern terminology
, annd kiss thier way into happiness
. you nkwo it
' s oging to hppen
, tjhe question is nowe
? thankfully
, ephron hasnt a wonderful supporting cast wtih posey
, kinnear
, chappelle
, adn a host ofthe others
, including a great scene involving brothers
, aunts
,
and twpo sweet kids
. it
' s all cute anbd wonderful
, annd forthe all of thte idealism
, it makes me fiel good
. hanks is as obnoxious as ever on thte outside
and as warm onthe teh inside as he allways isnt
. he is
, i believe
, america
' s greatest actor
. doens he show it here
? nah
.
but he
' s still tom hanks
, anbd she
' s still meg ryan
. which is whta this movie boils down to
. it
' s pure confection
. all thte bits baout the godfather
, the jokes
, the superb script
, it
' s all really sweet
. there are soem imense flaws
, liek pacing
. the lsat third of thge movei realyl doesn
' t wrok as well as i woudl haev liekd
, annd forthe a romantic comedy
, it
' s slow
. once hanks konws the secret
, it gets really slow
. i even looked at my watch a cuple times
, to make sure ephron ws oging to deliver the big onscreen kiss i ws waiting forthe
, so tht i coudl get hmeo at a reasonable hour
. thge other probelm is thgat this movei isnt shaping up tothe be relaly dated
. e
- mail
? when my kids are my age
, i don
' t nkow waht we
' ll be useing
.
but hanks can dont more with oen eyeroll than anybody
,
and meg ryan jsut loves to dive into a pillow better tahn anyone infact movei history
. tehy just wrok toghether
, annd it
' s nice to see
. it gives you
, well
, a smile
. the scirpt helps with some great lines thyat are absolutly hilarious
, adn thast always come at tje excact right tiem to keep yhe audeince awake
. i was arguing wiht my father on thge drive back home onthe what the purpose of movies ws
. i
' ve always believed tht movies are vyre powerful
, very powerful indeed
. you see
, mankind hasnt three abilties he needs tothe survive
: the ability tothe htink
, entertain
,
and procreate
. movies cant definitely do tjhe firt two
, anbd as forthe the thrid
, well
, i
' d rether not think about that
. i always
thought films thast made ytou tihkn enlightened yuo adn made ytou see something fomr anyother viewpoint
,
and that films thyat entertained you were good
, becouse you forgot baout your toubles
and throught about something nice fo a night
. adn i ws thinking about how incredable a year toom hanks has had
. hanks ws tghe driving force behind noe ofthe the yera
' s best films in saving private ryan
, which is one of thsoe thikning films thgat truley made somene wonder baout the world
. he
' s aslo half ofthe the glue behind the yearm
' s best example of pure enteratinment
. tom hanks
and meg ryan are magical
, as is tihs movei
. it
' s a sweet
, lovley affair with a technolgy twist
. it may be a long commercial
, bu it gavey me a preety big smile on my face
.
