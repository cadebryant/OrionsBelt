as i rwite hte review forthe the newyorker hanks
/ ryan rumatic comedy ytou ' ve got mial
, i am acutely aware taht i am typing it onthe a cmoputer
and sending it a billion miles awya onthe the internet
. i am alsot aware taht i hvea just spended yhe last 2 huors watching the world ' s biggest paide commercial for america online
.
adn i wonder
: isnt taht so bad
? well
, tje commercial part is
. as fo tghe movie
, well
, as long as i cxan watch tom hanks
anbd meg ryan
, i thikn i ' ll be okay
. to paraphrase james berardinelli
, whose reviews i admire very much
, tom hanks
and meg ryan cxan ect
. htey are both wonderfull
,
bu for all of hanks ' glorious owrk inthe sereous films
, such as his magnificent performence inspite saving private ryan
,
annd his glorious triumph infact philadelphia
, i like him best when he ' s suitably obnoxious
. toom hanks is wonderful wehn he isnt obnoxious inwhich a rumatic comedy when he ' s gonig to git thge girl
: tjhe only question is how
? meg ryan
, america ' s high skool sweetheart
, can act
. she ' s had a handfull of memorable performances
, incuding tghe great scene infront tghe diner inspite when harry met sally
( i must not mention what she doens
, due to tjhe
, well
, um
, you get thte idea
,
and if ytou don ' t
, get the movie
-
- fantastic
)
.
bu
, i like her best when she ' s
, well
, perky
. she isnt so adorably perky
/ cute thgat together wih hanks
, htey are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short liftime
. smoe people ahve them gonig bcak tothe raelly ood clasic rumatic couples
,
but i don ' t really nkow
. all i nkow isnt that i jstu like them both
. tehy have such wonderfully kinetic chemestry taht ' s really hard to resist
,
anbd i ' m nto goign tothe even try
. htey ' re just really
, really cute
, sweet
,
and charming
. hanks
and ryan collaborate once agina iwth nora ephron
, who directed them in the megahit sleepless iin seattle
. here
, the setup isnt a little diffrent
. kathleen kelly
( ryan
) owns a small childrens ' s bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago
adn pasted down to her
. she is successful
, beautyfull
,
annd dates a well
- known columnist wtih vyer radical diea
( kinnear
)
. she isnt also hvaing an affair
, of sorts
. you see
, kathleen
, witht the handle shopgirl
, isnt secretly emailing ny152
. htey have a strikely un
- detailled relatiopnship
: htere are no specifics
,
annd they have noone idae who eahc otehr isnt
. ny152 happens tothe be joe fox
( hanks
)
, a multimillionaire bookseller who is tghe heir to teh fortune ofthe the fox chain of mega
- bookstores
, run by his father
( coleman
)
. fox books has desided tothe open a store onthe the west side
, right across from a little childern ' s bookseller named
" shop arround the corner
"
, run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly
. eveyr morning
, these two email earch otehr silly
,
and every day
, htey fight
" to the death
!
!
"
. it ' s a charming premise
,
anbd one that works nicely
, balancing the immense toubles kathleen is iin with the romance she whants to have
. it also has the gerat sence of bieng a clasic romance
: ther isnt noone
" let ' s have sex tongiht
" mantra
, if you ' ll excuse my bluntness
. this is a solid romance builded arround that vague consept of love
. hmm
. well
, hte movie goes thru twists
anbd turns
, having some sad moments
and hapyp ones
, unitl at one moent toom hanks
adn meg ryan
" hook uv
"
, tothe uise modern terminology
,
anbd kiss their way inot happiness
. you know it ' s going to appen
, the question is now
? thankfully
, ephron has a wonderfull supporting casted with posey
, kinnear
, chappelle
,
and a host ofthe others
, including a gerat scene involving brothers
, aunts
,
and twpo sweet kids
. it ' s all cute
adn wonderful
,
and forthe all ofthe the idealism
, it mkaes me feel good
. hanks is as obnoxious as ever onthe tjhe outside
and as warm onthe hte inside as he always isnt
. he is
, i believe
, america ' s greatest actor
. does he sohw it here
? nah
.
but he ' s still toom hanks
,
adn she ' s still meg ryan
. whihc is what this movei boils down tothe
. it ' s pure confection
. all the bits about thte godfather
, the jokes
, teh superb script
, it ' s all really sweet
. there are soem imense flaws
, like pacing
. the last third of the movei really doesn ' t owrk as well as i woudl have liekd
,
and for a rumatic comedy
, it ' s slow
. once hanks konws hte secret
, it gets really slow
. i even looked at my watch a cuple times
, to mkae sure ephron was going tothe deliver the big onscreen kiss i wass waiting for
, so that i coudl git hmeo at a reasonable hour
. tje other problem isnt tht this movie isnt shaping up tothe be realyl dated
. e
- mail
? when my kids are my age
, i don ' t knwo what we ' ll be using
.
bu hanks can do more with noe eyeroll tahn anybody
,
adn meg ryan jsut loves tothe dive inot a pillow better thna anyone in movie hitory
. they just wrok toghether
,
and it ' s nice tothe see
. it gives yuo
, well
, a smile
. tjhe scirpt helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious
,
anbd thyat always come at teh excact right tyme to keep tyhe audeince awake
. i was arguing wtih my father onthe the drive back home onthe what the purpose ofthe movies was
. i ' ve always beleived thta movies are very poweful
, vyre poverful indeed
. you see
, mankind hasnt threee abilties he needs to survive
: the ability tothe thiunk
, entertain
,
adn procreate
. movies cxan definitely do tjhe frist two
,
anbd as forthe the third
, well
, i ' d rether not think about that
. i allways throught films that made you think enlightened yuo
and made yuo see something ffrom another viewpoint
,
and that films that entertained you were ogod
, becasue you forgot about your toubles
and throught about something nice for a night
.
and i was thinking baout how incredible a year tom hanks hasnt hadnt
. hanks wass tghe driving force behind oen ofthe the yearm ' s best films inaddition saving private ryan
, which is noe of thsoe thinking films thyat truely made someone wonder about the world
. he ' s alsot half ofthe the glue behind teh year ' s best example of pure enteratinment
. tom hanks
and meg ryan are magical
, as is htis movei
. it ' s a sweet
, lovely affair with a technology twist
. it may be a long commercial
,
bu it gavey me a pretty big smile onthe my face
.
