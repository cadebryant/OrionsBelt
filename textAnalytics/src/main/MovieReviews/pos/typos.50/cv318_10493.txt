only a eyar after thte intial release ofthe
" scream
,
" tjhe horror send
- up from veteren horror director wes craven annd screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe newyorker life into thge slasher genre
, the inevitable sequel
" scream 2
" hasnt arrived infront our theaters
. while the tounge
- inaddition
- cheek
, parodic element isnt still noticeable iin thsi film
, it
' s relaly a sideshow tothe a broader commentary on voilence
and tyhe media
and a more convential horror story
. yhe frist film
, while oftenly violent
and groosome
, was mostly lacking in genuin scares because alomst every scene ws played for camp value anbd the discussion ofthe yhe quirks anbd cliches ofthe horror movies wass nearly constatn
. thge premise ofthe
" scream 2
" is that a serieses ofthe copycat killings begin when a movie called
" stab
,
" based onthe a book writed by opportunistic reporter gail weathers
( courtney cox
) baout the events inthe
" scream
,
" is released
and twpo audiance munbers are killed durring the oppening screening
. i had heared baout this scene before i whent to see teh film annd ws suprised tothe find this sequence largley lacking in camp comedy
. its conclusion
, in wich a bleeding
, wounded woman stumbles infront front of yhe screen annd dies inthe front ofthe an audiance thgat cheers onthe becouse tehy think it
' s a publicity stunt
, isnt more surreal annd disturbing tahn anytying else
. the satire inthe
" scream 2
" thus takes on a broad focus
and gradually evolves inot an exploration ofthe media perceptions infact general
. altough recident horror film geek r
andy
( jamie kennedy
) is bcak wtih fresh dialogue about sequels
( adn
, interestingly anough
, how tehy are usually inferior tothe thier predecesors
)
, thge charactors inwhich this movie are drawing ffrom other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well
. everything fomr
" friends
" adn
" saved by tjhe bell
" tothe
" showgirls
"
and
" terminator 2
" is referenced here
; horror isnt only one of many genres avalable for lampooning
, anbd there aren
' t any
" wes carpentery
" jokes thsi timne
. omre importantly
, tihs film portrays charachters willing to go tothe disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly beeen warped by whta they have seen on tv anbd film
. the killings are clearly an imitation of hte previvous murders fomr
" scream
"
( infact fact
, hte culprit even plans tothe ule the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense
)
, weathers exploits thte situation for her own notoriety
,
and one man seems willing tothe sive tje heroine
' s life onyl if it wiull earn him an interview onthe the todya sohw
. underst
andably
,
" scream 2
" doesnt not go so far as to actally blaim tje movies
, bu rather shows tath those who dont immitate horror movies are alreayd sick
and twisted
. couple thast withthe the fatc that sevral ofthe tghe characters
, most noteably tghe lead character sidney prescott
( neve campbell
)
, are fairly well
- developped anbd tht there are some genuin moments ofthe spine
- chilling suspense
,
and what we hvae is a pretty darned ogod horror movie in its pwn right
. we don
' t jstu get tyhe horror of scarry masks
and graphic gore
- we aslo get tjhe horror ofthe sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their firends are slaughtered
( annd
, in one case
, a significant character who was an audeince favorite even bites hte dust
)
and whose lives have been reduced tothe constatn fear of a crazed murderer lurking arround tjhe corner
. while i ahev nto seen any ofthe his other owrk
, it
' s easy to see why craven is generally touted as tyhe most suphisticated
" slasher film
" directer
, as he claerly cares baout something more thna just thte actual acts of slashing
. unfortunately
,
" scream 2
" occasionally reverts to the time
- honored horror tradition of throwing logic outloud the window
. for exmaple
, severeal characters seem quite clearly dead
and inexplicably turn up alive later
- htere hasnt beeen a running gag inwhich both movies about hte villain being able to pul off this parituclar trck
, bu it alsot happens wtih otehr characters
and in an even less believeable fasion
. ther are also a faw scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind tyhe enxt victum inthe a situation such thgat
( s
) he claerly woudl have beeen seen moving in tht direction
. as for tghe question ofthe whether or not
" scream 2
" isnt
yet another sequel nto as ogod as its precedessor
.
.
. well
, it
' s hard to sday
. i gave thte firt
" scream
" 3 1
/ 2 stars as well because it worked preety consistently as a ight
- hearted send
- up
.
" scream 2
" bounces all over the palce stylistically
,
but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares adn asking teh questions about media violentce taht weere only hinted at in the first installment
. i
' m nto sure which is tghe better movie
,
but i doed leave the theater conviced of one thing
: sequels
, howver much r
andy might argue
, dont not necessarally suck
.
