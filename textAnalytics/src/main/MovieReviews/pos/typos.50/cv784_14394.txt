it
' s noone secret infront the motion picture inudstry tath hte relationship between a scirpt anbd the actors involved oftenly makse or breaks a movei at thte box office
. a poorly
- written scirpt cant be bested by a superb acting corps
,
and a well
- wroten piece cxan be mangled by a group ofthe amateurs
. infact directing his latest action
- comedy
, directer brett ratner
( omney talks
) tkaes a relitavely medioker piece of st
andup comedy
and turns it into a funny as all get
- out buddy cop movie
. in addition
, rush hour serves as a first
- clas example ofthe directing a movei with conservative attitide
- a feature that isnt sure to draw in crowds ofthe all types
. the two lead names share equal screen tyme here
, mostly because they spend it toghether
. jackie chan
, iin his first completely american production
, makes an impressive de
but by mixing dialogue iwth martial arts
. the other martial arts flick from a faw weeks ago
, knock off
, st
ands no chance aganist thte content ofthe thsi noe
. chan manages tothe make eveyr fight scene exude grace
and poise
,
and ther
' s noone doubt taht a larg precentage of video sales fo this movei will come from viewers who couldn
' t elieve their eyes the firt tiome
. chris tucker
, onthe the oposite side
, relates a hillarious comedic aproach which smoothes out teh rough edges to chan
' s performance
. he works perfectly with the scirpt
, annd it
' s qutie likely he lent scribe jim kouf a h
and with some ofthe his lines
. almost essentail to tyhe action genre
, yhe plot is nonexistent
. we
' re quicklyu intruduced tothe detective james carter
( tucker
) isnt a maverick officer for the lapd
. cutted forward to another scene where the duaghter
( julia hsu
) of thte american chineese consul
( tzi ma
) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters
. tyhe fbi is quick to the rescue
, bu hte consul insists thyat one ofthe his men
, detective inspector lee
( chan
)
, be brung onthe teh case tothe halp
. hte fbi resists
, bu thne requests that lapd send a man over tothe babysit the chinese detective
. it
' s here thta carter anbd lee hook uv
, anbd tghe two unwittingly solve thge case hwile teh fbi rushes infact tothe back them up
. rattner doens a fine job of gogin the extra mile tothe git his movie tothe move a step uv
, bu it doesn
' t quite reach the top tier of action
- comedies like last yera
' s grosse pointe blank
. there are moments where tje plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to
, anbd if nto fo tghe commedic interactions bewteen tucker annd chan
, thsi might be a major drawback
. alsot
, some supporting charactors are allmost entirely allong for hte ride
,
and others are there simpley tothe look menacing
. howver
, none gives a st
andoffish performance adn they mostly mesh into teh background
. allmost eveyr member ofthe yhe cast displays smoe reservation at one point or another
- whther it
' s tucker
' s toned
- down routine or chan
' s tight rein onthe his action sequences
- annd thast conti
butes greatly to tihs bieng a watchable movie forthe all types
. a recommendable vsiit to the theater
, indeed
