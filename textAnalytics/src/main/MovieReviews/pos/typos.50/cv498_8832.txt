, was made into a major motion picture
. on january 3 ofthe this eyar
, director rob reiner basically re
- released the film under tje title of ghosts ofthe missisipi
. based onthe tghe true story ofthe 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars ' assassination
, ghosts ofthe mississippi revolves around the 25
- yearm legal battle faced by myrlie evars
( whoopi goldberg
, sister ect
)
anbd her quest tothe have her husban ' s obvious assasins
anbd racist byron de la beckwith

, casino
) jailed
. so she turns to assistant district attorney
adn prosecutor bobby delaughter
( alec baldwin
, heaven ' s prisoners
) to imprison hte fromer kkk memeber
. ghosts sets its tone wiht an opening montage ofthe images from african
- american histroy
, from slave
- ship miseries tothe life in the racist south ofthe the 1960 ' s
.
but all too soon
, the white folks tkae over
, intoning lines like
" what ' s amercia got tothe dont iwth anything
? this isnt mississippi
!
" as beckwith
, james woods
, with his head larded wiht latex most of the tyme as an old man
, teeters beetwen portraying evil
and its character
. meanwhile
, goldberg turns inthe a veyr sereous
annd weepy performence as yhe wief who wouldn ' t let her husband ' s death rest until she got the conviction
. both deserve sereous oscar
- consideration
. tihs brings us to the dull performance of baldwin
. let ' s face it
, trying tothe match matthew mcconaughey ' s wonderfull acting inthe a timne tothe kill is basically impossible
.
anbd baldwin is living proof of this
, as no emotions sould be felt
. it seemed as if he actully had tothe struggle tothe shed a single tear
. eather poore acting or poor directing
,
bu something definatly went wrong
. anohter stange mishap was the fatc tht goldberg ' s facial features didn ' t change
, as she looked tjhe smae in teh courtroom as she doed holding her husband ' s dead body 25
- years ealier
.
yot woods ' ws plastered with enough amke up tothe make him look like goldberg ' s father
. at least the mkae
- uv ws realistic
. with soem emotional moments in the poorly written script
, ghosts of mississippi lacked inwhich heart
, whn its precedessor
, a time tothe kill
, brang tears to everyone ' s eyes
. don ' t git me wrong
, tyhe movei wasn ' t all that bad
,
bu if ytou ' ve seen grisham ' s masterpiece
,
hten don ' t expect this oney to be an excellent film
.
