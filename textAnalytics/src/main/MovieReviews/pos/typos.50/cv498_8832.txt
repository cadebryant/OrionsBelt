this summer
, one of tyhe most racially charged novels in john grisham
' s serieses
, a time tothe kill
, ws made into a major motion picture
. on januray 3 of this eyar
, directer rob reiner basically re
- released thge film under tyhe title ofthe ghosts of missisippi
. based on the true story ofthe 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars
' assassination
, ghosts ofthe missisipi revolves arund tje 25
- year legal battle faced by myrlie evars
( whoopi goldberg
, sister ect
)
and her quest to have her husban
' s obvious assassin
and racist byron de la beckwith
( james woods
, casino
) jailed
. so she turns to assitant district attorney adn prosecutor bobby delaughter
( alec baldwin
, heaven
' s prisoners
) to imprison thte former kkk member
. ghosts sets its tone with an oppening montage of images from african
- american istory
, from slave
- ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960
' s
.
but all too soon
, tyhe white folks take over
, intoning lines liek
" what
' s america got tothe do with anytying
? this is missisipi
!
" as beckwith
, james woods
, with his head larded witht latex most ofthe tghe time as an old man
, teeters between portraing evil anbd its character
. meanwhile
, goldberg turns iin a very serious
and weepy peformance as the wief who wouldn
' t let her husb
and
' s death rest utnil she got the conviction
. both deserve sereous oscar
- consideration
. this brings us to yhe dull performance ofthe baldwin
. let
' s face it
, trying to match matthew mcconaughey
' s wonderfull acting infront a tiem to kill isnt basicly impossible
.
and baldwin is living proof ofthe thsi
, as noone emotions coudl be falt
. it seemed as if he actualy hadnt to struggle to shed a single tear
. either poore acting or poore directing
,
but something definitly went wrong
. anyother stange mishap was yhe fact that goldberg
' s facial features didn
' t chanage
, as she looked the smae inaddition tjhe courtroom as she doed holding her husban
' s dead body 25
- years ealier
. yot woods
' wass plastered with enought amke uv tothe mkea him look like goldberg
' s father
. at least thte mkea
- up ws realsitic
. with some emotional moments in tghe poorly wroten scirpt
, ghosts ofthe mississippi lacked inwhich heart
, whn its precedessor
, a time tothe kill
, brought tears to everyone
' s eyes
. don
' t git me wrong
, the movie wasn
' t all that bad
,
but if you
' ve seen grisham
' s masterpiece
,
then don
' t expect this one to be an exellent film
