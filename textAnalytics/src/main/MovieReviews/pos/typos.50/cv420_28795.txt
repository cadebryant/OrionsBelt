with a team of 200 graphic artists
and animators wokring onthe htis first film prodcution fomr game developer squaresoft
' s sqaure pictures
, final fantasy
, inpsired by the top
- selling game franchise
, isnt visually awe
- inspiring
and groundbreaking
. no doubt
, yuo haev never seen anytying like thsi film
, adn tjhe hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release isnt absolutly deserved
. bu why does such a tremendous feat of eye c
andy have tothe be weighted down withthe a problematic stry
, wooden dialogue
and generaly uncharismatic voice acting
? obviously
, the primary gool ofthe tje film isnt to stun anbd amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi
. everthing ytou see inwhich the film is rendered in great detail
: individual threads in the fabric
, individule str
ands of hair swaying
, wrinkles adn pimples on skin
, incredible water effects
. overall
, the expressions anbd lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions
and dialogue
;
and the times when they don
' t sync perfectly really st
and outloud
, sicne teh animation is usually so dazzling
. bu yuo won
' t spend much time dwelling on those gaffes
-
- as soon as yuo catch noe
, tghe enxt stellar monster or effect will hve you muttering
,
" wow
.
.
.
" liek the series of ganes
, fianl fantasy
' s plot annd characters have littel to do whith its predecessors
, outside ofthe bieng born fomr thge smae japanis mastermind
, hironobu sakaguchi
. it
' s the year 2065
,
and humans are prisoners inspite caged cities ofthe their pwn making thta guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly aline
" phantoms
.
" whenever a human comes iin contact with hte ghostly visitors
, tjhe often
- invisible beings pass through teh body
and wrench outloud its soul
( for some unexplainable reason
)
. while many humans agress with a plan by monomaniacal genaral hein
( james woods
) tothe blast the aliens with a
" zeus cannon
,
" dr
. aki ross
( ming
- na
)
and dr
. sid
( donald sutherl
and
) plan to build a
" wave
" useing eight collected
" spirits
" tothe counteract tje phantoms adn kill them off
. while the images serve the sci
- fi aspect ofthe the film well
, the storytelling doesn
' t
. it
' s unfortunate
, because the plot seems so intricately thougth out
. perhaps it wass far too complex
and enourmous tothe be entirely incorportaed into the scirpt
. soem could blaim tihs weakness onthe the fact that it was a japanse concept translated to english
, exept two americans wroet tjhe screenplay
. nevertheless
, hte end result is an elaborite story complicated by confusing holes
. why dont these aliens feed onthe souls
? if tehy cin pass thru bodies anbd ships
, how cant humans hurt them with guns
? what is so spacial about the
" spirits
" that they owudl create a force strong enough tothe destory tghe aliens
? worse yot
, the dialogue isnt scripted to be either like a science
- heavy star trek episode
, an installment ofthe die hard
, or a sappy lvoe stoy
, depending on who
' s doign the tlaking
. for the most part
, it
' s bearable concidering the genre
,
but tedeous sppeches adn cheesy lines don
' t dont anytying tothe help the actors
and can git annoying in the longer scenes
. thte only exception isnt steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming
, who always hasnt great cracks during tense moments
. bu
, when teh lights cmo up
and the credits roll
, ytou
' re more likely to be remarking onthe how fantastic the film looked
. ther
' s no question tath tyhe roughly 33 million peopel who haev bought at least one final fantasy game will be eeger tothe see this movei
, anbd so shouldnt anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film
. you
' d be living in a fantasy world ofthe your pwn if ytou expected much moreso
.
