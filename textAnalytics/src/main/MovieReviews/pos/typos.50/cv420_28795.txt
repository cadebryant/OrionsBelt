with a team of 200 graphic artists
annd animators wokring onthe htis frist film production from gam developer squaresoft ' s square pictures
, final fantasy
, inspired by thge top
- selling gae franchise
, isnt visually awe
- inspiring
and groundbreaking
. no doubt
, ytou have never seen anytying liek htis film
,
and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved
.
but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy ahev to be weighted down with a problematic stor
, wooden dialogue
anbd generally uncharismatic voice acting
? obviously
, tjhe primary goal of the film isnt to stun
anbd amaze audiences whith extrememly sophicated cgi
. everything yuo see in the film is rendered infront grat detail
: individule threads inwhich the fabric
, individual strands of hair swaying
, wrinkles
adn pimples onthe skin
, incredible water effects
. overall
, the expressions
annd lip movements fairly accurately match thte emotions
and dialogue
;
anbd thte times whn htey don ' t sync perfectly really stand out
, usance tje animation isnt usally so dazzling
.
bu ytou won ' t spend much time dwelling onthe thsoe gaffes
-
- as soon as ytou catch noe
, the enxt stellar monster or effect will hvae you muttering
,
" wow
.
.
.
" like tyhe sories of ganes
, final fantasy ' s plot
annd characters have littel tothe do with its predecessors
, outside ofthe bieng born from the smae japanse mastermind
, hironobu sakaguchi
. it ' s tyhe yearm 2065
,
and humans are prisoners infront caged cities of their pwn makeing that guard them ffrom an outside world nowe overrun with deadly aline
" phantoms
.
" whenever a human comes infact contact wtih the ghostly vistors
, the oftenly
- ivisible beings pass through teh body
adn wrench out its soul
( for soem unexplainable reason
)
. while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein
( james woods
) tothe blast the aliens wiht a
" zeus cannon
,
" dr
. aki ross
( ming
- na
)
and dr
. sid
( donald sutherland
) plan tothe build a
" wave
" useing eight collected
" spirits
" tothe counteract the phantoms
adn kill them off
. hwile tyhe images serve the sci
- fi aspect ofthe thge film well
, the storytelling doesn ' t
. it ' s unfortunate
, baceause the plot seems so intricately thougth outloud
. perhaps it was far too complex
annd enourmous to be entirely incorportaed inot the script
. soem could blame thsi weakness on the fatc that it was a japanesse consept translated tothe english
, except two americans wrote the screenplay
. nethertheless
, the end result is an elaborate stor complicated by confusing holes
. why dont theese aliens feed on souls
? if htey cin pass thru bodies
and ships
, how cant humans hurt them wtih guns
? whta isnt so special baout tyhe
" spirits
" thta tehy would create a force strong enough tothe destroy teh aliens
? worse
yet
, tyhe dialogue isnt scripted to be either liuke a sceince
- heavy star trek episode
, an installment of dieu hard
, or a sappy love sotry
, depending on who ' s doing the talking
. for the most part
, it ' s bearable considering hte genre
,
bu tedeous speeches
annd cheesy lines don ' t do anytying tothe help the actors
and can git annoying in yhe longer scenes
. the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming
, who alwasy hasnt gerat cracks during tense moments
.
but
, when tje ligths cmo uv
adn the credits roll
, you ' re more likely tothe be remarking on how fantastic the film looked
. there ' s noone question thta the rougly 33 millon peple who hve bought at least oney final fantasy game iwll be eager tothe see htis movie
,
anbd so should anyone who enjoys being floored by thge best cg animation ever put to film
. ytou ' d be living in a fantasy world ofthe your pwn if you expected much more
.
