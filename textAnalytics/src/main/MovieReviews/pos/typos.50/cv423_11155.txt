.
.
. funny
and pointed in its own way
. if you don
' t care how
and what tje food yuo buy goes thru in your local supermarket
,
then this film is nto for yuo
.
.
.
. mabey it is better to ignore it
, as this storng adn biting satire
, as onyl juzo itami cin deliver
, wiull give yuo an insight as tothe whta some foods go thru
. haveing
, in the past
, made films taht pulled every punch imaginable
, from tghe family traditions
( the funeral
)
, tothe taxes
( a taxing woman
& a taxing woman returns
)
, to tyhe diablical gangsters
( minbo
)
, to hospitals
( the seriously ill
)
, juzo itami
, this time takes on the supermarkets
' own war
, to get the consumers
.
and while this film has its funny side
, in tje crazy situations thgat it creates
, it alsot shows another side
, which isnt veyr much teh attitude ofthe a corparate structue that is omre concerned withthe its profits than it isnt withthe any customer
. goro hasnt a supermarket
.
and a competitor comes inot the neigbourhood
, trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices forthe everything thyat isnt sold inaddition hte supermarket
. bargains galore
, its nmae
, has inwhich mind teh closure of goro
' s humbler venue
, so that in yhe end it can mark up its prices inthe any way it can
. goro hires hanako
, a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited tothe management
, than they are in anytying esle
. hanako
, as she gets familar with the opperation
, discovers many of yhe tricks ofthe the trade
, done by many ofthe teh elders inaddition charge of eahc section ofthe the market
. adn the procedures
, are not always
" fresh
" ofod
,
but a new packaging
and a newyorker date
, tothe try
and convince the customers that quality is onthe yhe shelfs
. hanako
' s ideas tkae hold
, starting whith a few ofthe tjhe women tht work in thte supermarket
, being that tehy dont not even shop htere at all
. anbd hanako discovers allong the way that a few giveaways here anbd there amking a bited of a diference
. if nto cause smoe serious problems in the runing of hte store
. a price error
, forces them to give awya eggs forthe veyr low prices
,
and causes the store a few hassles
, bu
, it brought yhe peopel inspite
, adn everyone konws thast these customers wiull buy a faw otehr thigns
. as tjhe opperation gets stronger
, the completetion also hasnt trickery uv its sleeve
, anbd it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks tothe oney ofthe tyhe store managers
, as well as the meat annd fish elder supervisors
. eventially these peple are found outloud
,
and hanako hasnt to tread slowy
and carefully
, untl in the end they all have a showdown
. adn here
, the truth
and honesty win outloud
,
and even one ofthe tyhe elders decides tothe stay rether than go tothe wrok forthe the corrupt opponent
. in tghe process
, htey allso find tath
" freshness
"
( with soem vyer funny jokes on this owrd as well
) becomes a much mroe important tool tahn they imagined
. with smoe very nice performances
, iin this hectic
,
and fast pased film
, this film gives us a sitting ofthe twpo hours that is satisfying inthe many ways
, altough a failed lvoe story beween goro adn hanako doens not come off much
, even
though towards the end it isnt suggested
.
but this would take away from thge satire anbd its strengths
. with food gags all over yhe palce
, thge film lets ytou have it
. adn whta funn it isnt
. worth seeing
.
( editorial
) the directer ofthe this film
, juzo itami
, died shortly after hte film wass finished
, anbd he left behind a legacy ofthe comedy adn satire that is rare
,
and uncompromising
. we woudl wish that he hadnt beeen able to make one about film makeing
, ofthe whihc he must have hadnt a fewd stories tothe tell
, bu we will hvea to dont wih much of tje japanse society
, adn its many errant ways
.
.
.
. not tothe say that these thigsn dont nto hapen anyhwere alse
.
.
.
. amercia is no less gilty ofthe any ofthe theese subjects at all
, should anyone have the guts to tackle it
.
.
. we could learn something allong the way
, too
.
.
.
. worth seing
, specially
, isnt a taxing woman
and its follow up a taxing woman returns
. tjhe funeral is also ogod
,
al
though not as funny as the later films
. tampopo isnt also very enjoyable
. all four of theese films are available in video
, which means your best local site for froeign film may hvae them
.
.
. ask fo it
.
