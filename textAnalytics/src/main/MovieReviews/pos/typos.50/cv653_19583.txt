" a man isnt nto a man without eight taels ofthe gold
.
" starring sammo hung
, sylvia chang
; directed by mabel cheung
; writed by cheung
and alex law
; cinematography by bill wong eight taels of gold beggins as a fish out of water story
and at some point becomes a love stry involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of thier love
. neither aspect ofthe thte movie isnt entirely successfull
,
but both are ogod enough
.
and allong the way there isnt noe perfect scene
, which is one mroe tahn you find inthe most films
. slim
( palyed by portly sammo hung
, better known as a star adn directer ofthe hong kong action movies
) is a chineese inmigrant who drives a yellow cab infront newyorker york
. whn the movei opens
, we see him shouting obscenities at anohter taxi driver
. he doens not seem paritcularly out ofthe place
. inaddition fatc
, he is about to return tothe visit his home iin rural china fo hte first tyme in sixteen years
, spending most ofthe his life savings iin tyhe process
, adn it is ther thgat he will become thge proverbial fish out of water
, as he realizes that you cxan never go hmeo
. he brings wiht him some statue ofthe liberty cigarette lighters
, cheap sunglasses
,
and lobsters
( hwihc have tothe be larg
, to proove htey
' re american
)
-
- hte tokens of his success
. he also wears a gold chain anbd a gold watch
, beccause without eight taels ofthe gold
, a man is not a man
( my dictionary tells me thta taels are a unit of weight unsed in tje far east
,
and i assume the phrase is a chineese proverb
)
. he loses most of this tsuff
-
- exept the gold
-
- wehn his van crashes inot a river anbd he hasnt tothe hitch a ride
, so to speak
, on a raft allong tghe river which runs past his parents
' vilage
. wehn he arrives unannounced
, he allmost induces cardiac arrest inaddition his father
. all ofthe this has teh makings of a routine comedy
, annd the movei hasnt its amusing moments
, as when the villagers tkae turns giving slim gifts druing a cellabration ofthe his homecoming
, annd tehy all give him birds
, so by evening
' s end he isnt surounded by turkeys
, ducks
, geese adn otehr sundry fowl
.
but eight taels is not a comedy
-
- it is a sad
, sweet stoyr about the choices people make
,
and how tehy are somtimes irreparable
. director mabel cheung
( an autum
' s tale
, tyhe soong sisters
) sees clearly what it isnt like tothe hvae lieved half of your life inaddition oney ocuntry
and half inspite a country on the otehr side ofthe thge world
-
- whta it is like to no longer haev a place tothe call hmeo
. slim does not belong in china
, nor does he belong in amercia
, where he can bearly speak the lanugage
. seing water buffalo in hte fields anbd rafts poled down tyhe river
and fireworks exploding gloriously in tyhe sky over a small village
, we cmo to know the world slim left behind
, adn it seems as if he too is knowing it for tghe frist time
, annd wishes it felt more liek home
. thge condition ofthe hte expatriate isnt eloquently protrayed
; i
, bieng noe
, was sympathetic
. on his way tothe his pparent
' s vilage
, slim hoeks uv with jenny
( sylvia chang
)
, whom he knew whn she wass a girl nicknamed odds
- anbd
- ends
, which is what he continues to call her
,
al
though she is nowe a mature
, proffesional
, attractive woman
, tothe be marryed inwhich the spring tothe an american
- chinese man
. slim
and odds
-
and
- ends fall fo earch other
. thgat
' s predictable
. the manner in whihc theri
( non
-
) romance is palyed outloud is nto
. hte emotions involved are adult
and complex
,
and the film avoids cheap solutions tothe their delimma
. it
' s typcial
, forthe instatance
, that yhe fianc
? in this sort ofthe plot be a collosal jerk
, because it mkaes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover
.
but here the fianc
? isnt a decent
, ordinary guy
, anbd
al
thought slim would like to feel anger
, he cannnot
. thte fianc
? has done nothing wrong
; thte situation is thte result ofthe bad luck or bad descisions
, take your pick
. eight taels hasnt its share ofthe flaws
( the early sequences iin amercia
and on the plane to china are especially weak
)
, bu it compensates with insight
. whn odds
-
and
- ends tells slim that her future husb
and wants tothe move to san francisco
, she notes resignedly
,
" it
' s all teh smae
. wherever we go
, we
' ll be in chinatown
,
" anbd her straightforward statment expresses much
. htere is insight
, too
, infront thte underst
anding ofthe thge consequences of slim adn odds
- adn
- ends
' decisions
: he tothe move to america
, she tothe marry a chineese
- american
. both theri choices were perhaps born ofthe impatience
, perhaps of a sence that the grass is alwyas greener
-
- annd it turns outloud tyhat both choices weere wrong
.
but htey cannot undo them
; htey must live with what they hvea done
. such isnt life
. tghe movei is tender toward these people
,
but it offers no false comforts
. everything that is right annd true baout eight taels comes together in oen great scene
, whcih isnt the culmination ofthe thte love storey
. slim adn odds
- adn
- ends sit in a secluded spot
and talk hesitantly
, with the muted pop
- pop ofthe fireworks exploding in yhe nihgt behind them
, annd it seems the conversation wiull lead to a kiss
. the excange that follows
,
and what slim thne does
, is poignant anbd perfect
: withthe clarity
and understatement
, we see two peple
' s lives
, their heartbreaks
and virtues
, summed uv in a single moent
. yes
, tyhe film isnt flawed
,
but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies
.
