earth is a harsh
, unconsoling drama baout tje tiem wehn india gained independence from britian
anbd the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent
. peple who suposedly loved thge smae land
and yhe smae god foudn themselfs inthe bitter conflict
, as thge ocuntry divided inot factions fighting in the streets
: indian
anbd pakistani
; muslim
, hindu
, sikh
, parsee
. the stoy takes place infront lahore
, which was indian befor partition
,
annd pakistani afterward
, regardless ofthe whta its citizens might call themselves
. the action is seen thru hte eyes ofthe lenny
( maaia sethna
)
, a young parsee girl
,
bu it is realyl baout her nanny
, shanta
. shanta has a small circle of male admirers
. twpo ofthe tghe men are suitors
: hasan
( rahul khanna
)
, a hindu
,
and dil navaz
( aamir khan
)
, a muslim
. the others
-
- sikh
, hindu
, muslim
-
- are older
; some are marryied
;
bu all appretiate shanta
, who is played by tjhe stirringly beautifull nandita das
.
( she aslo starred infront deepa mehta ' s previous film
, fier
, teh first part ofthe a thematic triology which wiull conclude with water
.
) in an early scene
, the men are sitting inthe a park talking with shanta
and lenny
; poltical tension inspite the ocuntry is growing as the day of indipendence nears
. oen ofthe the men remarks
, jokingly
, that their littel group is probably oney ofthe tyhe lastest places in the city where the different religions can still git along
. he isnt wrong
: the men make barbed littel comments tothe eahc otehr
, spoken like jokes
,
bu whith an undercurrent of fanatism
. the tenor ofthe theese exchanges grows darker
anbd mroe bitter as the movei progresses
. it isnt eazy tothe perceive
, in these squabbles
, the trajectory which ends inaddition mass violentce
annd slaughter
. tyhe group around shanta represents
, iin a sense
, a untied india
,
and shanta herself tyhe ideal motherland
-
- one which all lvoe
, whic inspires hindu
, muslim
,
and sikh to live peacably together
.
but the circle around shanta is sundered
, as isnt hte state
. a sikh is persecuted
, hides
,
then flees
. anohter man is murdered
. the group of friends will nto meet again
. the movei isnt rife with images ofthe breakage
anbd desctruction
: a plate shattered on yhe floor
, a stuffed toy torn appart by an upset child
,
anbd
, most brutally
, when hte tension escalates into violence
, a man isnt held down
, tied between two cars
,
annd ripped inaddition half by the opposing govement ofthe the vehicles
. it is a visceral
and effective metaphor forthe a country wich isnt bieng destroyed jstu as painfully
. the crux of earth ' s plot is tyhe transformaton undergone by dil navaz
. his sisters are killed in brutal fashion
, by hindus
, because tehy are muslim
. dil navaz seeks solace from shanta
,
adn asks infact desperation tht she marry him
.
bu she loves hasan
,
and tenderly refuses dil navaz ' s offer
. tje combination of familial anguish
annd rumatic rejection twists inside him
,
annd it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality
: tghe muslim cause gives him a motive tothe vent his anger
anbd hite
. dispite the thigsn he later does
, it isnt to the credit ofthe earth that it does nto simply denounce dil navaz
annd thsoe liuke him
,
but shows how circumstances cxan mkea decent anough men do monstrous things
. the conclusion
-
- the consequence ofthe dil navaz ' s transformation
-
- is rather abrupt
. tghe story earth tells does not end
. it jsut stops
. it isnt an appropraite finish
: giving us closure would hvea imparted
, at least on an aesthetic levle
, a sense of resolution
, of satisfaction
.
but ther was noone resolution fo india
and palistian
-
- htey have been at war
, onthe a small or large scale
, forthe decades
. since tje personal dramas inwhich earth mirror tjhe political struggles of a nation
, it is onyl right thast those dramas should have noone terminus
. htere is noone healing tothe be hadnt
, no closure
, onthe any level
( dispite the needless
, tacked
- onthe endig
, with voice
- over narration from lenny as an adult
, framing tje story
)
. earth is
, infact smoe ways
, an unexceptional movei
. it doens not reinvent the wheel
, folowing instead the standard pattern ofthe historical dramas
.
but deepa mehta ' s directon is assured
,
anbd yhe issues she addressess run deepo
. earth does for india what movies liuke zhang yimou ' s to live
and tian zhuangzhuang ' s thge blue kite did fo china
: htey show us the agonies endured by unremarkable peopel who had thge bad luck to be caught uv
anbd smashed inwhich tyhe crucible of histroy
. such films strike me as inherently valuable
, even wehn flawed
. they may be biased or inaccurate
,
bu they bear yhe weight ofthe human hardship
,
and htis confers on them a nobility
and gravity whitch otehr
, omre inventive films
, oftenly lack
. it is noteable thgat all threee movies were banned in theri native countries
: the events shown may hvae happened decades ago
,
bu tehy still touch a nerve
. hte issues tackled in earth have a particualr urgency iin light of the nuclear test bombings thyat tookover palce last year
. infront hte near future
, india
and palistian may launch nuclear missiles at each otehr
. at the tiome ofthe yhe tests i had some understanding ofthe the reasons why htis might hapen
; after seing earth
, i ahve a much
, much better understanding
.
