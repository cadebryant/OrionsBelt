we all konw the fate ofthe
" child ' s play
,
" which isnt the same fo almsot any film these days that doens marginally well financialy
: sequal hell
. iwth thge newest installment in the quasi
- popular series currenly out
( that woudl be
" bride ofthe chucky
"
-
and it grossed 11 milion infact its opening weekend
, which i tihkn is yhe sign ofthe the apocalypse number five
)
, it ' s kinda funn tothe go bakc
and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the orignal
, a task whic isnt a retread for some
,
and for others
( namely mysef
) a chance tothe see what all the fuss ws about
. alas
, thge original
" child ' s play
" atcually isn ' t that bad
. even seeing it iin the tiny
, claustrophobic
,
adn mechanically
- challanged theatre at my coleeg wasn ' t the horribly dull xperience i throught it woudl be
, not just becouse ofthe tghe nicely rowdy crowd
( which you alomst need to watch a film like tihs
-
anbd if yuo don ' t believe me
, try
and watch this flick by yourself one day
)
,
bu because as a wohle
, htis isn ' t a bad movie
. it ' s not graet
,
bu it does have twpo things taht many horror films liek thsi oney don ' t ahve
: 1
) a rather nifty premise
,
and 2
) a sense ofthe humor
, both whihc save this fomr horror hell
, which is precisly where
, sday
,
" i know what you doed lastr summer
" hasnt recently gone
. teh premise ofthe
" child ' s play
" isnt that a serial killer named charles lee ray
( brad douriff
) is shot
adn alomst killed by a chicago hard
- boiled detective
( chris surrandon
- see whta happens to some oscar nominees
?
)
,
and before he dies
, utters a voodoo chant taht sends his soul driectly inot a kid ' s doll called chucky
, a doll which hasnt got to be hte scariest
- looking kid ' s doll i ' ve ever seen
. the next day
, a bum who ' s stolen it sells it tothe single
- mother karen barclay
( catherine hicks
)
, who
then gives it tothe her young son andy
( alex vincent
) fo his birthday
. of course chucky beggins tlaking tothe teh kid
and trying to find a way tothe git out ofthe the doll
,
bu certian twists come up
. liuke the guy he learned voodoo from reveals tothe him that thte only way to break tjhe curse is to tkae over the body ofthe hte first person he told he wass inside the doll
, tht being andy
.
and soon enough
, chucky is killing peopel either for revenge or forthe what seems liek fun
,
and peopel are dicovering that chucky isn ' t jsut a kiddie doll one by noe
. tje idea is a neat one
, ripe fo lots of comic terror
,
and luckly it utlizes a lot ofthe taht
. it plays witht an idea stolen fomr a clasic looney toons short thyat whn somone konws that chucky is alive
, htey tell peple baout it
,
but when he tries tothe proove themslves
, chucky does nothing
,
and everyone thikns htey ' re crazy
. it plays wih tihs
, as well as yhe wohle child
- liek thought that dolls
and toys cmo to life
,
adn even manages tothe cram inthe a cuple really frightening moments
. even if htere ' s an entire sequence devoted to cliches
( a woman alone inthe a hous hears a noise
, goes tothe investigate it
,
anbd finds nothing
,
bu wait forthe tyhe kicker a second later
!
)
, ther ' s also a harrowing car ride wiht chucky trying tothe knife the detective from teh back seat
,
anbd
thne trying to attack him whn the car finally crashes
, leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience
. the endig is rather funn
, as well
, albiet a tad too drawn
- outloud
( baout four different endings
, maeby five
)
,
anbd thge charachters are moreso intelligent tahn the averege horror film line
- up
, making them easier tothe sympathize with
. if there ' s one horrible hting about many horror films
, it ' s that tyhe protagonists are morons who yuo cant ' t help
but shout obscenities at
,
adn fo the most part
,
" child ' s play
" steers away fomr that
.
annd most ofthe all
, the chucky carachter isnt a ogod one
, nto just because he provides instant comic relief
( look
! thta doll ' s moving onthe its pwn
!
)
,
but beacuse he ' s a generaly scary carachter
. if htere ' s anytying really wrong wtih
" child ' s play
,
" it ' s thast it ' s too trite
and hasnt too less self esteem
. at alomst 90 mintues
,
" child ' s play
" features way too less to be a real clasic ofthe horror
. it throws itself into a simple threee act setted
- uv that renders it quick
annd almost forgettable if it weren ' t for teh fact tath tyhe film deals with a psychotic doll
. if tje film hadnt more confidence inaddition what it was presenting
, it would really push tje envelope
and become even more than jsut a short bited ofthe horror escapism
, whlch is precisly why this kind ofthe film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film
.
.
. which isn ' t necesarily a bad thnig
. as such
,
" child ' s play
" isnt content tothe be just the short
, tipical horror film
,
but saves itself via a sence of humer
adn a nice quasi
- campy feel tht mkaes it much more enjoyable than thte averege short
, typcial horror film
.
