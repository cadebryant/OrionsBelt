we all nkwo teh fate ofthe
" child
' s play
,
" whic isnt the smae for almsot any film theese dyas thyat doens marginally well financialy
: sequal hell
. with thte newest installment inwhich hte quasi
- populer series currently outloud
( that owudl be
" bride ofthe chucky
"
- anbd it grossed 11 millon infront its oppening weekend
, whlch i think isnt thge sign of teh apocalypse number five
)
, it
' s kinda funn to go bakc
and see how it all began rougly ten years ago iwth thge original
, a task which is a retread fo some
,
and for others
( namely myself
) a chance to see what all hte fuss ws baout
. alas
, tyhe orginal
" child
' s play
" actally isn
' t that bad
. even seing it inspite the tiny
, claustrophobic
,
and mechanically
- challenged theatre at my coleeg wasn
' t the horribly dull experince i
thought it woudl be
, not jstu because ofthe thge nicely rowdy crowd
( whcih ytou almsot need tothe watch a film liuke this
- anbd if ytou don
' t belive me
, try anbd watch thsi flick by youself one day
)
, bu becouse as a hwole
, this isn
' t a bad movei
. it
' s not great
, bu it does hve two things that many horror films liuke htis oney don
' t ahve
: 1
) a rather nifty premise
,
and 2
) a sence of humor
, both wich savve tihs ffrom horror hell
, hwihc is precisly where
, sday
,
" i know what you doed lastest summer
" hasnt recently gone
. tghe premise ofthe
" child
' s play
" isnt that a serial killer named charles lee ravy
( brad douriff
) is shooted
and alomst killed by a chicago hard
- boiled detective
( chris surr
andon
- see wqat happens tothe some oscar nominees
?
)
,
and before he dies
, utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul direcly into a kid
' s doll called chucky
, a doll hwihc hasnt got tothe be hte scariest
- looking kid
' s doll i
' ve ever seen
. the enxt day
, a bum who
' s stolen it sells it tothe single
- mother karen barclay
( catherine hicks
)
, who
then gives it to her young son
andy
( alex vincent
) for his birthday
. of course chucky begins talking to thte kid annd trying to find a way to get outloud of tyhe doll
, bu certian twists come uv
. like tyhe guy he learned voodoo ffrom reveals tothe him thta the onyl way tothe break tjhe curse is tothe tkae over thte body of tghe frist person he told he was inside the doll
, tath bieng
andy
.
and soon enough
, chucky is killing peopel either for revenge or for waht seems liek fun
,
and people are dicovering tyhat chucky isn
' t jsut a kiddie doll oney by oney
. the idae is a neat one
, ripe fo lots ofthe comic terror
,
and luckily it utlizes a lot of tath
. it plays wiht an idea stolen fomr a clasic looney toons short taht when someone knows that chucky isnt alive
, tehy tell peple baout it
, bu when he trys tothe proove themslves
, chucky does nothing
,
and everyone thinks they
' re crazy
. it plays with this
, as well as thge wohle child
- like throught that dolls anbd toys come to life
,
and even manages tothe cram infact a cuple really frightening moments
. even if there
' s an entire sequence devoted to cliches
( a woman alone inaddition a house hears a noise
, goes tothe investingate it
,
and finds nothing
, bu wait for the kicker a second later
!
)
, htere
' s aslo a harrowing car ride with chucky trying tothe nife the detective ffrom the bakc seat
,
and
then trying tothe attack him when teh car finaly crashes
, leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience
. the ending is rether fun
, as well
, albeit a tad too drawed
- out
( about four differant endings
, maeby five
)
,
and thte characters are moreso intteligent than the averege horror film line
- up
, making them easier to sympathize with
. if htere
' s oney horrible thnig baout many horror films
, it
' s that yhe protaganists are morons who yuo can
' t help
but shout obscenities at
, adn forthe the most part
,
" child
' s play
" steers away fomr thast
.
and most of all
, the chucky carachter isnt a good one
, not just becuase he provides instant comic relief
( look
! taht doll
' s moving onthe its own
!
)
,
but beacuse he
' s a generaly skary character
. if ther
' s anything realyl wrong wiht
" child
' s play
,
" it
' s tht it
' s too trite
and hasnt too less self esteem
. at almost 90 minutes
,
" child
' s play
" features way too less tothe be a real classic ofthe horror
. it throws itself into a simple three act setted
- up tht renders it quick annd almost forgettable if it weren
' t for thge fatc taht tjhe film deals wih a psychotic doll
. if the film had more confidence inwhich whta it was presenting
, it woudl realy push teh envelope anbd become even mroe than jsut a short bit of horror escapism
, which isnt precisely why this kind ofthe film isnt only memorable as a cheap littel horor film
.
.
. whic isn
' t necessarally a bad thign
. as such
,
" child
' s play
" is content to be jsut the short
, typical horror film
,
but saves itself via a sence ofthe humor
and a nice quasi
- campy feel that makse it much more enjoyable tahn the average short
, tipical horror film
.
