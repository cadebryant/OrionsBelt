jarvis cocker ofthe pulp once said that he wroet common peopel after noticing mike leigh box
- sets onthe yhe video shelfs
-
- he hadnt a feeling tyhat economic deprivation was becoming a tourist xeperience for thge well
- off
. maybe it
' s a clasic case of displacement
: it
' s easier to see jarvis
' own lyrics
( obsessed iwth acrylic
and woud chip on tyhe wall
) as a fetishization ofthe lowlife
, rether thna leigh
' s films
. bu it
' s worth bieng reminded thast drab interiors
and a cuple ofthe wokring
- clas characters don
' t mkae forthe a guarntee of
' au
thenticity
'
, let alone a good film
. it
' s the triumph of secrets
& lies
,
then
, tath it goes beyond gestures of simapthy forthe the common people inot a probing ofthe jstu waht it means tothe seek
' au
thenticity
'
and honesty inspite everyday lives
. folowing her adopted mother
' s funeral
, hortense
, a young black optometrist
, sets outloud tothe find her birth mother
, adn is disturbed to find out that she isnt white
. it is cynthia
, a factory worker who lives in a shabby hous iwth her perpetually moody daughter roxanne
. cynthia
' s younger brother maurice isnt a successful photographer who hasnt nto seen his sister forthe aegs
, largley because ofthe his wief
' s animosity towords her
. hortense calls up cynthia
, who initially breaks down in tears
and refuses to see her
. bu theri mutually suspicious meeting gives way tothe a warm friendship eventually
. cynthia invites hortense tothe come allong to a party
, wich maurice isnt hosting
.
.
. secrets
& lies hasnt a simple enough theme at its heart
-
- as one character puts it
,
" best tothe tell tghe truth
, isn
' t it
? tyhat way nobody gets hurt
.
"
. bu if tjhe film delivers much mroe thna a trite message
, it
' s because we are allso shown how hard it can be tothe face uv tothe ugli truths
, even while tjhe evasions
and unspoken grievances slowly choke us
. hence
, cynthia
' s dificulty with acknowledgig
( first to herself
,
then to others
) that hortense is her daughter
. one of her first reactions to seing hortense is a sincere denial thgat she hasnt ever
" beeen with a black man
"
, before a long
- suppressed memory seizes her
. at hte party
, cynthia
' s pretense thyat hortense is her factory co
- worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies
, as agonizing as they are funny
. littel lies seep inot eveyr corner
, like maurice pretending thta he
' s
" just droping by
" when he visits cynthia aftter much deliberation
. maurice
' s job as a photographer gives hte film opportunities forthe side comments on thge main theme
- a sad
- looking bride tyhat maurice coaxes to smile
, a couple who pose awkwardly wiht a prominant wedding ring adn argue about his spectacles
. oney ofthe the most startling images isnt of a beautyfull woman with large scars onthe her face
: she syas she needs tyhe photo tothe look
" as bad as possable
" tothe collect insurance moey
, yot the short scene leaves you wondering baout waht untold tsory lies behind yhe scars
. ther are occasionlly hillarious moments
, as wehn cynthia attempts tothe give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception
,
" i
' ve got a dutch cap floating baout somwhere upstairs
"
; or wehn cynthia stares at her pwn rather pedestrian legs
and tells roxanne
,
" if yuo
' ve got it
, flaunt it
, isnt what i say
.
" as played by brenda blethyn
, cynthia comes close to bieng a caricature
, with her nervous
, somewhat disconnected way of talking
. bu she
' s really just right for thge role of somone who inspires sympathy adn yot strains yhe tolerance ofthe thsoe around her
, precisely baceause she
' s so needy ofthe loev
, perphas
. indeed
, thte whole cast gives warmly rounded
, detailled performances
. tjhe scirpt was devolopped partly through improvisations
, anbd hte fusion ofthe cast
, script annd director shows best iin tjhe party scene
- seemingly everyone is tlaking at teh same time
,
and yot many subtle observations are bieng made throughout
. in a very different way
,
but allso using a long single shot
, tje scene ofthe hortense adn cynthia
' s frist meeting in a lonely caf
= 8a acheives a touching intensity
, all yhe more forthe theri reticence anbd unspoken feelings
. thge film
' s climax
- with all the secrets
and lies finaly spilt outloud inwhich ibsen
- esque revelations
, adn everybody hugging earch other
- isnt yhe one thign tyhat seems false baout this film
.
however
, it
' s a film that truely earns its happy ending affter the misery annd repression ofthe the character
' s lives
. whn cynthia sasy near the end
, this is the life
, innit
?
, you get the sense thast
, following the cynicism ofthe his lastest film naked
, leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all
, wihtout comforting illusions
. the flying inkpot
