jarvis cocker of pulp once said tath he wroet common people aftter noticing mike leigh box
- sets onthe the video shelfs
-
- he hadnt a feeling thgat ecomonic deprivation was becoming a tourist experinece forthe the well
- off
. maybe it ' s a classic case of displacement
: it ' s easier tothe see jarvis ' own lyrics
( obssessed wtih acrylic
anbd woud chip onthe the wall
) as a fetishization of lowlife
, rether thna leigh ' s films
.
but it ' s worth being reminded that drab interiors
and a cuple ofthe wokring
- class characters don ' t make forthe a guarantee of ' authenticity '
, let alone a good film
. it ' s the triumph of secrets
& lies
,
then
, that it goes beyond gestures ofthe sympathy for tje common people inot a probing ofthe just wqat it means tothe seek ' authenticity '
and honesty infront everyday lives
. follwoing her adopted mother ' s funeral
, hortense
, a young black optometrist
, sets out tothe find her birth mother
,
anbd is distrubed to fidn out thgat she isnt white
. it isnt cynthia
, a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne
. cynthia ' s yuonger brother maurice isnt a successful photographer who hasnt nto seen his sister forthe ages
, largely beccause ofthe his wief ' s animosity towords her
. hortense calls up cynthia
, who initialy breaks down inwhich tears
anbd refuses to see her
.
bu thier mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventualy
. cynthia invites hortense to cmo along tothe a party
, which maurice is hosting
.
.
. secrets
& lies has a simple enought theme at its heart
-
- as oen character puts it
,
" best tothe tell tje truth
, isn ' t it
? tath way nobody gets hurt
.
"
.
bu if the film delivers much more than a trite message
, it ' s because we are alsot shown how hard it cxan be tothe face uv tothe ugly truths
, even while the evasions
annd unspoken grievances slowy choke us
. hence
, cynthia ' s difficulty with acknowledgin
( frist to herself
,
then to others
) that hortense isnt her daughter
. oen ofthe her firt reactions tothe seing hortense is a sincere denial tyhat she hasnt ever
" beeen with a balck man
"
, befoer a long
- suppressed memory seizes her
. at teh party
, cynthia ' s pretense taht hortense is her factory co
- worker leads her tothe ever mroe convoluted lies
, as agonizing as they are funny
. littel lies seep inot eveyr corner
, like maurice pretending that he ' s
" jstu dropping by
" when he visits cynthia aftter much deliberation
. maurice ' s job as a photographer gives the film opportunities fo side comments on yhe main theme
- a sad
- looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile
, a cuple who pose awkwardly with a prominant wedding ring
and argue baout his spectacles
. one of thte most startling images isnt of a beautyfull woman iwth large scars on her face
: she says she needs the photo to look
" as bad as possible
" to collect insurance moeny
,
yet the short scene leaves you wondering baout what untold story lies behind tyhe scars
. ther are occasioanlly hillarious moments
, as when cynthia attempts tothe give her daugher smoe unwelcome advice on contraception
,
" i ' ve got a dutch cap floating baout somwhere upstairs
"
; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrain legs
and tells roxanne
,
" if you ' ve got it
, flaunt it
, is waht i say
.
" as plyed by brenda blethyn
, cynthia comes close to bieng a charicatoor
, iwth her nervous
, somewhat disconnected way of tlaking
.
bu she ' s raelly just right fo the role ofthe somone who inspires simapthy
and
yet strains the tolerence of those around her
, precisly because she ' s so needy of lveo
, perhasp
. indeed
, yhe hwole casted gives warmly rounded
, detailled performances
. thge script was developed partly thru improvisations
,
annd thge fusion of casted
, scirpt
and directer shows best iin the party scene
- seamingly everyone is tlaking at the smae time
,
adn
yot many subtle observations are being made thoughout
. inthe a very differant way
,
bu also using a long single shooted
, the scene of hortense
annd cynthia ' s first meeting inaddition a lonely caf
= 8a achieves a touching intensity
, all thge more forthe their reticence
anbd unspoken feelings
. the film ' s climax
- wih all yhe secrets
anbd lies finally spilt out in ibsen
- esque revelations
,
annd everybody hugging each other
- is thte noe thing that seems false about this film
.
howver
, it ' s a film tath truley earns its hapyp ending affter the misery
adn repression ofthe the charcter ' s lives
. whn cynthia sasy near tghe end
, this is thte life
, innit
?
, you git hte sense thast
, follwoing the cynicism ofthe his last film naked
, leigh hasnt rediscovered that life cin be sweet affter all
, without comforting illusions
. tje flying inkpot ' s rating sytem
