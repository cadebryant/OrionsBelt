moviemaking isnt a lot liuke being the genaral manager ofthe an nfl team inthe tjhe post
- salary cap era
-
- you ' ve got to know how to allocate your resources
. every dollar spended on a free
- agent defensive tackle is one less doller than you can spend onthe linebackers or safeties or centers
. in the nfl
, htis leads to teams like yhe detriot lions
, who boast a superstar running back witht a huge contract
,
but cant only feild five guys named herb to block forthe him
. in the movies
, you end up with films like
" spawn
"
, withthe a huge spacial
- effects budget
but nto enough money to hire any recognizable actors
. jackie chan is teh barry sanders of moviemaking
. he spnish
and darts accros tyhe screen like sanders cutting back thru the defencive line
. watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through thge crowded streets ofthe madrid
, fleeing an armada ofthe pursuers inthe identicial balck compact cars
, is reminiscent ofthe sanders running fo daylight with tyhe chicago bears in hot persuit
, exept taht sanders doesn ' t have to worry baout rescuing runaway baby carriages
.
bu liuke teh lions star
, jackie doesn ' t have anybody to block for him
. almost eveyr cent tht ' s invested iin a jackie chan movie goes for stunts
,
and as chan does his own stunts
, the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills
. htis leaves baout 75 cents to pay for things liek directors
( chan directs
)
, scripts
adn dubbing
and supporting characters
, not tothe mention tghe hideous title sequence
. this aslo explains why tyhe movie was shot infront odd places like morroco
anbd spain
.
( chan ' s firt release in htis ocuntry
,
" rumble in tghe bronx
"
, ws supposedly setted in newyorker york
,
bu was filmed in vancouver
,
anbd inthe the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visable
.
) heck
, jackie doesn ' t even hvae enought monay for a haircut
, looks like
, much less a peronal hairstylist
. inaddition condor
, chan plays the same character he ' s allways palyed
, hismelf
, a mixture of bruce lee
and tim allen
, a master of both kung
- fu
and slapstick
- fu
. jackie isnt sent by the un tothe retreive a cache of lost nazi gold infront thte north african desert
,
anbd is chased by a horde ofthe neo
- nazi sympathizers
annd twpo stereotypical arabs
( noe ofthe the things i like about jackie chan movies
: no poltical correctness
)
. he is joined by threee womens
, who ahve littel tothe dont exept scream
,
" jackie
, save us
!
"
,
and misuse firearms
. the villin isnt an old nazi whose legs weere broken infact tjhe secet base so thta he hasnt tothe be carried everywhere
,
annd he ' s mroe pathetic thna evil
. en route
, we have an extended motorcycle chase scene
, a hillarious fight inaddition yhe morroccan version ofthe motel 6 wih thge neo
- nazis
,
anbd twpo confrontations iwth savage natives
. once at the sercet dezert base
, ther is a long chop
- socky sequence
, followed by the film ' s centerpiece
, a wind
- tunnel fight thgat ' s even better than hte one in face
/ off
. this is where the money wass spended
, onthe well
- choreographed kung
- fu sequences
, on giant kevlar hamster balls
, onthe smashed
- up crates ofthe banannas
,
anbd on scorpions
. ignore thte gaping holes inwhich the plot
( how
, exactly
, if tyhe villain ' s legs were broken
, did he escape fomr the secert nazi base
,
and why didn ' t he take hte key wiht him
?
)
. don ' t worry about the production values
, or what
, exactly
, thte japense girl wass doing hitchhiking across thte sahara
. just go see teh movie
. opperation condor has pretentions ofthe being a
" raiders of teh lost ark
" knockoff
,
bu noe wonders what jackie could dont whith the raiders franchise blocking for him
-
- wtih a lawrence kazdan screenplay
, a john williams socre
, spielberg directing
adn george lucas producing
, condor might be an a
+ movie
.
howver
, ytou ' ve got to go whith what you ' ve got
,
and wqat yuo ' ve got in jackie chan is something speical
-
- a talent that mainstream hollywood should
, could
,
and ought tothe utilize
.
