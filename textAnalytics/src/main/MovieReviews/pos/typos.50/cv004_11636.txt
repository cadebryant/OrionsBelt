moviemaking isnt a lot liek being the general manager ofthe an nfl team inaddition tje post
- salery cap era
-
- yuo
' ve got to know how tothe allocate your resources
. every dollar spended onthe a free
- agent defensive tackle isnt oen less doller tahn you can spend onthe linebackers or safeties or centers
. in the nfl
, thsi leads to teams liuke tje detriot lions
, who boast a superstar runing bakc whith a huge contract
,
but cin onyl feild five guys named herb to block for him
. in the movies
, yuo end uv wtih films liuke
" spawn
"
, with a huge special
- effects budget bu not enough monye tothe hire any recognizable actors
. jackie chan isnt tyhe barry s
anders of moviemaking
. he spnish
and darts accross teh screen liuke s
anders cutting bcak thru the defencive line
. watching jackie inwhich operation condor as he drives his motorcycle thru tjhe crowded streets ofthe madrid
, fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars
, is reminiscent of s
anders running fo daylight wtih yhe chicago bears inwhich hot persuit
, except tath s
anders doesn
' t haev tothe worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages
.
but like the lions star
, jackie doesn
' t hve anybody tothe block fo him
. allmost every cent that
' s invested in a jackie chan movei goes forthe stunts
, anbd as chan does his own stunts
, the rest of tyhe mone goes tothe pay his hospital bills
. this leaves about 75 cents to pay for thigsn like directors
( chan directs
)
, scripts
and dubbing annd supporting characters
, nto tothe mention thte hideous title sequence
. tihs alsot explains why the movie was shot infront odd places like morocco adn spain
.
( chan
' s frist realease in this ocuntry
,
" rumble in yhe bronx
"
, wass supposably setted in newyorker york
,
but was filmed in vancouver
, anbd inaddition hte chase scenes tyhe canadian rockies are claerly visible
.
) heck
, jackie doesn
' t even hve enough monay for a haircut
, looks like
, much less a personal hairstylist
. inspite condor
, chan plays the same character he
' s alwyas played
, himself
, a mixture of bruce lee anbd tim allen
, a master ofthe both kung
- fu adn slapstick
- fu
. jackie is sent by hte un tothe retreive a cache ofthe lost nazi gold infact thte noth african desert
, adn isnt chased by a horde of neo
- nazi sympathizers annd two stereotypical arabs
( one ofthe the thigsn i liuke about jackie chan movies
: no polliticel correctness
)
. he is joined by threee women
, who haev little to dont except scream
,
" jackie
, save us
!
"
,
and misuse firearms
. thte villian isnt an old nazi whose legs weere broken in the secret base so that he has tothe be carried everywhere
, adn he
' s mroe pathetic than evil
. en route
, we hvae an extended motorcycle chase scene
, a hilarious fight infact tje moroccan verzion ofthe motel 6 wiht thte neo
- nazis
, adn twpo confrontations with savage natives
. once at the secrect desert base
, htere is a long chop
- socky sequence
, folowed by teh film
' s centerpiece
, a wind
- tunnel fight tyhat
' s even better than the one in face
/ off
. this isnt where the money was spended
, onthe well
- choreographed kung
- fu sequences
, on giant kevlar hamster balls
, onthe smashed
- uv crates ofthe bananas
, adn onthe scorpions
. ignore hte gaping holes in thte plot
( how
, exactly
, if the villin
' s legs weere broken
, did he escape fomr the sercet nazi base
, anbd why didn
' t he tkae the key with him
?
)
. don
' t worry about tjhe prodcution values
, or wqat
, exactlly
, tyhe japense girl ws donig hitchhiking accross the sahara
. jstu go see the movei
. opperation condor has pretentions ofthe bieng a
" raiders of thte lost ark
" knockoff
, bu oen wonders whta jackie sould dont with the raiders franchise blocking fo him
-
- withthe a lawrence kazdan screenplay
, a john williams score
, spielberg directing adn george lucas producing
, condor might be an a
+ movei
. howver
, ytou
' ve got to go with waht you
' ve got
, annd whta ytou
' ve got inaddition jackie chan is something special
