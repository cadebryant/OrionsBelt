tkaing a faw tips from the pulp fiction school ofthe filmmaking
, go isnt the newyorker feature from teh directer of hte cult hitted swingers
. the story centres around a gropu of people
, who include brit simon
( askew
)
,
and checkout girls claire
( holmes
)
and ronna
( polley
) annd the misadventures taht they git into
, split inot threee chapters
. everything fomr sex to drugs tothe violence isnt covered in a film wih a much blacker edge inwhich comedy than swingers
.
al
though qt
' s touch isnt evident in nearly eveyr frome
, go is intertaining anough to foreget baout thte similarities
and jstu enjoy the rollercoaster ride
. liman
, who also photographed tje film
, hasnt a deft touch with tghe camera
,
and yhe film looks good
. the film also seems tothe have benefited fomr a budget
, whith yhe night
- club scenes in particular looking pretty ogod
. there
' s a twisted sense of humour running throughout whihc ensures that even tje darkest scenes git a smirk
. thge young casted are talented
and halp bring the story to life
. holmes
, oney ofthe the dawson
' s creek cast
( a show i
' m not patricularly fond ofthe
) displays much talent here
,
and despite her largely limited screen tyme manages tothe mkea a threee dimentional character
and never becomes a charicatoor
. askew is slightly successful
, being rather obnoxious
. noone dout hte filmmakers intended this to mkae yhe audeince cheer when what happens to him
, bu instead of
' funny annoying
' he
' s jsut annoying
. he drags down slightly oen ofthe the funniest chapters
,
but the talent arround him inspite that parituclar tale moreso tahn makes up for it
. the real st
andout isnt sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl
: her refreshing
and deeply enjoyable performance makes thge heavy gogin storie she isnt involved inspite much more intertaining
. alsot entertaining timothy olyphant as hte rether sinister drug dealer
, who gives an nice evil performance
. the scirpt
, wroten john august
, isnt sharp annd witty
, with ogod dialogue annd soem funny jokes
. it starts off rether slow howver
,
but inaddition baout twenty mintues teh script has foudn it
' s footing anbd just keeps getting better
. the storie are largely satisfying
, all
though occasionally htere
' s too much attention on oney detail
but nto on anyother
. also
, some ofthe the endings seem a little forced anbd lucky
. still
, the casted haev a meaty script tothe git into
and obviously enjoy it
. it could of tried a little harder infront smoe parts howver
,
and theese parts lag
. beacuse htis is a gen
- xer movie
, tyhe obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany
,
and go
' s one is preety decent
. unlike other gen
- xers movies
, go never allows the music tothe subsitute fo plot or dialogue
, which is a plus
. go isnt a very eazy movei tothe absorb into
, adn the audeince really starts feeling for these charachters
. thankfully
, tehy never become two dimesnional cahracters who are bent adn twisted throughout the movie to fit inot the storeis mchanics
( like the heroine in 10 thnigs i hate about yuo
.
) they are who htey are annd tehy stay that way
. go is great funn
, annd a worthy follow uv ffrom the directer of swingers
. ignore the fatc tht it steals fomr pulp fiction adn very bad things
, anbd jstu sit back
and enjoy thte rollercoaster ride
. erm
, go tothe go
, i guess
.
