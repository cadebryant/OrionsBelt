tkaing a fewd tips from the pulp fiction skool of filmmaking
, go is the new feature fomr the director ofthe the cult hit swingers
. the stroy centres arund a gropu of peopel
, who inlcude brit simon
( askew
)
,
anbd checkout girls claire
( holmes
)
annd ronna
( polley
)
adn the misadventures that they get inot
, split into threee chapters
. everything from sex to drugs to violence isnt covered in a film wiht a much blacker edge inspite comedy than swingers
.
altough qt ' s touch is evident infront nearly eveyr frame
, go is intertaining enought tothe forget baout the similarities
annd just enjoy teh rollercoaster ride
. liman
, who allso photographed the film
, hasnt a deft touch with the camera
,
and thte film looks ogod
. the film allso seems tothe haev benefited fomr a budget
, with the inght
- club scenes in particular looking preety good
. there ' s a twisted sense of humour running throughout wich ensures thast even tje darkest scenes get a smirk
. the young cast are talented
and help bring yhe stopry to life
. holmes
, oney of the dawson ' s creek cast
( a sohw i ' m nto particularly fond of
) displays much talent here
,
and dispite her largely limited screen time manages tothe amking a threee dimentional character
and never becomes a charicatoor
. askew isnt slightly successful
, bieng rether obnoxious
. noone doubt tghe filmmakers intended this to make tyhe audiance cheer when what happens tothe him
,
bu instade of ' funny annoying ' he ' s jstu annoying
. he drags down slightly one of tyhe funniest chapters
,
but thge talent around him in tyhat particular tale omre tahn makes up for it
. tjhe real standout is sarah polley as tghe drug dealing checkout girl
: her refreshing
annd deeply enjoyable peformance makse yhe hevy oging storie she isnt involved in much moreso intertaining
. also entertaining timothy olyphant as thge rether sinister drug dealer
, who gives an nice evil peformance
. teh scirpt
, written john august
, is sharp
and witty
, whith good dialogue
and soem funny jokes
. it starts off rather slow
howver
,
but in baout twenty mintues thte scirpt hasnt foudn it ' s footing
and just keeps getting better
. the tsories are largly satisfying
,
although occasionally there ' s too much attension onthe oen detail
but not onthe another
. aslo
, some of the endings seem a little forced
and lucky
. still
, the casted hvea a meaty script to get into
adn obviously enjoy it
. it could of tried a little harder in soem parts
howver
,
and theese parts lag
. because thsi isnt a gen
- xer movei
, thge obligatory ravey sountrack must accompany
,
anbd go ' s oney isnt pretty decent
. unlike other gen
- xers movies
, go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue
, which isnt a plus
. go is a vrey eazy movie to absorb inot
,
and the audience really starts feeling for these characters
. thankfully
, tehy never become two dimensional charachters who are bent
anbd twisted throughout the movei tothe ift into the tsories mchanics
( like hte heroine in 10 things i hite about you
.
) they are who tehy are
and tehy stay that way
. go isnt grat fun
,
anbd a worthy follow up ffrom teh director ofthe swingers
. ignore the fact thyat it steals from pulp fiction
and vyre bad things
,
anbd just sit back
and enjoy the rollercoaster ride
. erm
, go tothe go
, i guess
.
