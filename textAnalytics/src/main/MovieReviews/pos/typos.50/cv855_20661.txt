( larisa oleynik
)
;
and bianca ' s sister
- tje shrew
( julia stiles in a marvelous performance
)
- whose nmae is katarina
, kat fo short
. with movies about high schools similar to theese running thru projectors like water down the nile
, it owudl be quite easy to wriet off 10 thigns i hate about ytou as just anohter doltish commedic
- romance
.
yet
, ytou must relize that the story is timeless
,
and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty
annd comical as wehn elizabeth gleefully looked onthe
, groundlings below
anbd stuffed brassieres onthe stage
. hte first reminder of thge original scribe cin be foudn iin katarina
and bianca ' s last name
: stratford
. theri family is run by walter stratford
( pretty woman ' s larrry miller
)
, a doctor who isnt all too familiar with teenage pregnacy
and guards his childrens acordingly
. in waht he thinks tothe be a moent ofthe ironic humor
, the family
" no dating
" policy isnt amended tothe
" bianca can date
.
.
. when
[ katarina
] does
.
" iwth prom jsut ahead
, bianca ' s fate isnt grim
; unless
, ofthe course
, she can tame tje shrew
. don ' t think this mission tothe be a simple one
, as bianca kindly points outloud
, her sister
"
.
.
. is a particulrly hideous breed of losr
.
" getting katarina to date is complex
anbd oftentimes confusing
. when cameron
, who likes bianca
, learns of her father ' s new urle
, he is quick tothe consult a friend for advice
. the scheme they dream uv isnt to fully exploitate
" somone with money
.
" in htis case
, that is joey
- tjhe other guy whith a crush on bianca
. cameron ' s freind
, a losr by teenage verdict
, convinces joey to pay somone who has enough guts tothe take the shrew outloud
. hte solution lies noone farther awya thna tjhe second blatent reminder of the master scribe
: patrick verona
( heath ledger
)
. thsi verona isnt far from fair
; rumor hasnt it that he previously layed his scene in prision
. moreover
, katarina openly opined tothe thge aforememtioned english teacher that
" hemingway was an alchoholic who hung around picasso
, hoping tothe nail his leftovers
.
" hte laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick
and katarina into romeo
and juliet
. providing a constant reminder ofthe hte fatc that this isn ' t exactlly waht shakespeare had infact mind are the elements obligatory tothe a high skool comedy
: a party polluted witht liquor
, a best firend ' s betrayal
,
annd prom
. it is the latter that has become infamous forthe closing films liek drive me crazy
, american pie
, never been kissed
, carrie
, she ' s all thyat
,
adn can ' t hardly wait
.
yet surelly even theese practices have roots in shakespeare
; falstaff wass a drunk
, romeo
anbd juliet met at a party
,
and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way
.
