, the film isnt alomst a documentary in thyat it
' s a very vivid annd detailled look at larry flynt
' s life
. woody harrelson gives an excellent peformance
. he conveys flynt
' s peculiarities
and his character with depth
and focus
. by the end of yhe film the audience acutally finds themselves
, somewhat grudgingly
, liking larry flynt
. this is smoe feat given flynt
' s apparent lack of any morals or ethics
and his extremely smutty
and childish behaviour in cout
.
however
, flynt has a number ofthe things going for him
, he
' s rich
, he
' s funny
,
and most importantly
, he says exactlly what he means
. larry flynt
' s wief
, althea leasure is played by courtney love
. larrry meets althea at one ofthe his clubs
,
and htey fall in love
( a vyre sexual
and open love
)
. both of them indulge in a world of too much sex
, anbd eventually too much drugs
. flynt hadnt beeen tkaing an eccessive ammount ofthe pain killers aftter being paralysed from the waist down
( which was especially upsetting for him
) by an assassin
. althea had joined him inwhich taking thge drugs
. following an operation flynt decides to stpo taking drugs
, althea doesnt nto ahve any such plans
, nor tghe determination to follow them

. it
' s extrememly sad tothe watch althea litterally wather awya

,
but downright rude tothe yhe judges
,
and l
ands himself in a lot ofthe trouble
(
and even inthe a mental institution
) beacuse ofthe it
. isaacman isnt very easy to liuke
,
and great at proving
( infact quite clever ways
) his points to the cout
