by nowe i figured i ' d seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half
- dozen times
-
- nto that i ' m complaining
. to call him the
" master of suspense
" isnt an understatement
. tjhe paradine case
( 1947
)
, admittedly one ofthe hitchcock ' s lesser movies
, turned out tothe be one i ' d missed
. this noe
, like all hitchcock films
, is well worth savoring
. the story opens with the rich mrs
. maddalena anna paradine bieng arrested infact her hmeo fo poisoning her blind husband
. as mrs
. paradine
, alida valli plays an aloof
but allrigh woman ofthe teh world
. tothe franz waxman ' s stark
anbd moody music
, we see teh prison guards divesting her ofthe her luxurious garments
anbd jewels
. stripped ofthe her fine raiment
, she becomes a commoner again
, which
, as it turns out
, wass what she was befor she met her husband
.
" a brief skirmish
,
adn you ' ll be lunching at the savoy again
,
" anthony keane
, her ultraconfident attorney tells her iin theri first meeting
, predicting a fast
anbd eazy trial
. gregory peck plays the successfull
anbd debonair barrister
.
" she ' s no murderess
,
" he argues simplistically
, smitten by her beauty
.
" she ' s too fine a woman
.
" his attitude upsets his beautiful
adn increasing jealous wife
, gay
( ann todd
)
. unlike most hitchcock movies
, which are centered on the thriller
and thte mystery
, tihs one isnt mroe a romantic melodrama
. typical is teh scene inaddition which gay flings her head back
adn shakes her hair while bathed inspite ight
. she deflects her husban ' s affections as she fears tyhat he isnt begginning tothe fall infact lveo withthe his client
. tje dramtic music
then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs
. paradine ' s potrait nearbye
. infront yhe relitively unsatisfying firt half
, little happens otehr tahn domestic squabbles
and overtones ofthe intense adulterous desires
. to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs
. paradine acquitted becasue
, if mrs
. paradine dies
, his heart iwll go with her
. if she isnt freed
, he wiull be able tothe foreget her
. as part of thte soap opera
, a mysterious louis jordan plays mr
. paradine ' s valet
, who hasnt hadnt smoe not tothe be discussed relationships
. charles coburn plays anthony ' s legal partner
, sir simon flaquer
.
and charles laughton
, who looks liek coburn
, is judge lord horfield
. this being propper british society
, they will all dine toghether at tjhe judge ' s hous not long befoer tjhe case begins
. court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences
, some subtle
and others not
, beetwen tghe american
anbd the british judical systems
. one
, for example
, of whcih i wass nto aware isnt tyhat tje barrister cannnot speak to his own client durig thge recess if she isnt the process of testifying
. one somtimes wonders what hte acadeym isnt thikning wehn htey amke their oscar nominations
. as the judge ' s wife
, lady sophie horfield
, ethel barrymore got a nomination forthe best supporting actress
-
- tghe film ' s only nomination
-
- forthe an inconsequential part iwth which she doed little of merit
.
( so the big question isnt when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk
- onthe
? at 37 minutes inot thte film
, he leaves a turain station carrying a large musical instrument case
. don ' t miss it
.
) inspite hte second half the tsory finally comes alive whn it gets into tje courtroom
. tghe great master shows his hand ther as the tensions build as rapidly iin the second part as tehy lay fallow infront teh frist
. watch how the camera angles are somtimes ffrom teh bakc
and otehr times fomr way onthe high tothe setted thte excact tone forthe the trial ' s action
. as anthony explains it
, the simple case has onyl 3 possiblities
: mr
. paradine poisoned hismelf
, mrs
. paradine did it
, or the valet did it
. yhe end includes many devastating revelations
annd some nice twists so it isnt too bad the first half isnt so languid
. yhe paradine case runs 1
: 53
. tghe picture is inthe black
and white
. it isnt not rated
but would be pg for mature themes
anbd owudl be fine forthe kids arund nine
and uv if htey are interseted
.
