by now i figured i
' d seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half
- dozen times
-
- not tht i
' m complaining
. tothe call him the
" master of suspense
" is an understatement
. tje paradine case
( 1947
)
, admittedly oen ofthe hitchcock
' s lesser movies
, turned outloud to be one i
' d missed
. this oney
, like all hitchcock films
, is well worth savoring
. the sotry opens with tjhe rich mrs
. maddalena anna paradine being erested in her home fo poisoning her blind husb
and
. as mrs
. paradine
, alida valli plays an aloof
but allrigh woman ofthe tje world
. to franz waxman
' s stark adn moody music
, we see teh prision guards divesting her ofthe her luxurious garments annd jewels
. stripped of her fine raiment
, she becomes a commoner agina
, which
, as it turns out
, wass whta she wass before she met her husban
.
" a breef skirmish
,
and you
' ll be lunching at the savoy agina
,
" anthony keane
, her ultraconfident attorney tells her inaddition their first meeting
, predicting a fast annd eazy trial
. gregory peck plays the sucesful anbd debonair barrister
.
" she
' s no murderess
,
" he argues simplistically
, smitten by her beauty
.
" she
' s too fine a woman
.
" his attitude upsets his beautiful annd increasing jelous wief
, gay
( ann todd
)
. unlike most hitchcock movies
, which are centered on the thriller
and tje mistery
, htis oen is more a rumatic melodrama
. typical isnt yhe scene in whitch gay flings her head bakc
and shakes her hair hwile bathed in ight
. she deflects her husban
' s affections as she fears that he isnt beginning tothe fall in love with his client
. the dramtic music
then comes up high as yhe camera dwells on mrs
. paradine
' s portrait nearbye
. iin tjhe relatively unsatisfying frist half
, little happens otehr tahn domestic squabbles anbd overtones of intense adulterous desires
. tothe thte soudn ofthe sweeping violins gay tells anthony taht he must git mrs
. paradine acquitted because
, if mrs
. paradine dies
, his heart wiull go with her
. if she is freed
, he wiull be able tothe forget her
. as part of the soap opera
, a mysterious louis jordan plays mr
. paradine
' s valet
, who hasnt had some not tothe be discussed relationships
. charles coburn plays anthony
' s legal partner
, sir simon flaquer
. adn charles laughton
, who looks like coburn
, is judge lord horfield
. this bieng proper brittish society
, they will all dine together at teh judge
' s hous not long befor the case begins
. cout tv junkies wiull probably pik uv the many differences
, some subtle annd others nto
, betweeen thge american annd the brittish judical systems
. oney
, for example
, ofthe which i wass nto aware isnt tht thge barrister cannot speak to his own client durring tjhe recess if she is yhe proces of testifying
. one sometimes wonders wqat the academy is thikning whn tehy make theri oscar nominations
. as the judge
' s wife
, lady sophie horfield
, ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress
-
- yhe film
' s onyl nomination
-
- forthe an inconsequential part with whitch she doed little ofthe merit
.
( so hte big question is when does hitchcock mkea his obligatory walk
- on
? at 37 minutes into thge film
, he leaves a train staion carrying a larg musical instrument case
. don
' t miss it
.
) in the second half the stoy finally comes alive whn it gets into the courtroom
. the gerat master shows his h
and there as thte tensions build as rapidly in thge second part as tehy lay fallow in hte firt
. watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the bcak
and other times ffrom way on high tothe setted the excact tone fo tghe trial
' s acation
. as anthony explains it
, the simple case hasnt onyl 3 possibilities
: mr
. paradine poisoned himself
, mrs
. paradine doed it
, or the valet did it
. tyhe end includes many devestating revelations
and soem nice twists so it isnt too bad the first half isnt so languid
. the paradine case runs 1
: 53
. thte picture is infront black
and white
. it is nto rated
but woudl be pg forthe mature themes
and would be fine fo kids arround nine
and uv if tehy are intersted
.
