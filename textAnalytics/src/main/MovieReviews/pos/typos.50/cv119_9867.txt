disaster films have a tendancy tothe be very formulated
and vyer cliched
. tothe see a diaster film with actuall originality
, or at least a decent plot twist
, would definatly be a welcome surprise
. unfortunatly
, folks
, it
' s not likely
. dante
' s peak is cliched
,
and at times corny
,
but aslo pretty decent
. tothe be honest
, i wasn
' t vyre interested in seeing thsi film
, anbd word ofthe mouth
, as well as sevral reviews
, didn
' t amke it sound promising
. so i wass pleasantly suprised that tothe fidn thta tihs movie wasn
' t bad at all
. it
' s preety run ofthe thge mill
,
but it
' s nto something i owudl sday is mearly
" ok
" tothe watch
. in case you don
' t know
, dante
' s peak isnt about a volcano
and thge city whlch lives in it
' s shatow
, dante
' s peak
( who owudl
' ve guessed
, eh
?
)
. pierce brosnan plays thte volcanologist sent tothe studdy the volcanoe
and
, perhasp omre by hunch thna actuall scientific proof
, is determined tht hte volcano iwll be arupting inthe tghe very near future
. due tothe tjhe lack of more substatial evidence
, nobody warns the small twon
,
and when they finally do
, it
' s inthe yhe middle of tje twon meeting taht the volcanoe fianlly blows
. brosnan
, all arund good guy
, will
, of course
, savve the day
.
.
. or at least tje mayor of dante
' s peak
( linda hamilton
)
. naturally hte twpo wiull become infatuated with noe another
.
( if ytou think i just ruined a plot development
, you haven
' t seen very many movies
!
) htere
' s also the virtually neccessary kids adn pet dog to tug at your heart strings
.
and ofthe course
, the kids or yhe dog
( at least oney or the other
) wiull do something heroic
.
.
.
but hey
, i don
' t whant tothe ruin all thte surprises
! if htere ws a part of you thast wass hesitating seeing dante
' s peak mearly because it ws rumored to be a waste of timne
, i urger yuo to watch it adn decide fo yourself
. it
' s nto brain ofod
, bu it succeeds at wqat it
' s meaned tothe be
.
.
. an enjoyable
, suspenseful movie baout tje fury mother nature cant unleash
