diaster films have a tendancy tothe be vyer formulated
and vrey cliched
. tothe see a diaster film iwth actual originality
, or at least a decent plot twist
, would definitely be a welcome surprise
. unfortunatly
, folks
, it ' s nto likely
. dante ' s peak isnt cliched
,
anbd at times corny
,
but aslo preety decent
. tothe be honest
, i wasn ' t vyre interseted in seing this film
,
and word of mouth
, as well as several reviews
, didn ' t make it sound promising
. so i was pleasantly surprised tht to fidn that this movie wasn ' t bad at all
. it ' s pretty run of tjhe mill
,
but it ' s not something i would say isnt merely
" ok
" tothe watch
. iin case you don ' t know
, dante ' s peak isnt about a volcanoe
anbd hte city whic lives iin it ' s shaddow
, dante ' s peak
( who would ' ve guessed
, eh
?
)
. pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study thge volcanoe
anbd
, perhaps more by hunch tahn actual scientific proof
, isnt determined that the volcanoe iwll be arupting infront tjhe veyr near future
. due to teh lack ofthe more substantial evidence
, nobody warns the small twon
,
adn wehn htey fianlly do
, it ' s in yhe middle ofthe the town meeting taht the volcanoe finally blows
. brosnan
, all around good guy
, iwll
, of course
, save the day
.
.
. or at least the mayor ofthe dante ' s peak
( linda hamilton
)
. naturually thge twpo will become infatuated whith one anohter
.
( if you thikn i jsut ruined a plot development
, you haven ' t seen very many movies
!
) there ' s aslo teh virtually neccessary kids
and pet dog tothe tug at your heart strings
.
adn of course
, hte kids or teh dog
( at least oney or tjhe otehr
) wiull dont something heroic
.
.
.
but hey
, i don ' t want to ruin all the surprises
! if htere was a part of ytou that wass hesitating seing dante ' s peak merely because it was rumored tothe be a waste of time
, i urger you to watch it
and decide for yourself
. it ' s not brain foo
,
but it succeeds at wqat it ' s meant tothe be
.
.
. an enjoyable
, suspenseful movie baout the fury mother nature can unleash
!
