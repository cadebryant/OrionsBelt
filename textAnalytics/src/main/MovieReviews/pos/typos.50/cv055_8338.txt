i was fortunate anough tothe attend an advance screening for thge upcoming thriller conspiracy theery
. this ws
, ofthe course
, a big dael for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me adn i never git a chance at something liuke tihs
. not only doed i get to see an advance screening
, i ws able to see an advance screening ofthe a
* very ogod
* movei
. tjhe very fast
- pased film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher
, a fast
- tlaking
, witty
, comical taxi driver in new york city
. gibson
' s performence isnt terific
,
and his character isnt similar tothe tyhat of martin riggs in the leathal weppon films
. gibson again teams uv iwth richard donner
, as he doed in tjhe lethal weppon films anbd maverick
,
and htis timne arund
, thge combination works even better
. thte charactor of jerry fletcher is indeed unique
. try to imagin a toned
- downed verison of travis bickle who
, tihs time arund
, is a jittery guy with knowlege of governement conspiracy cover
- ups
. if you can imagin that
, thn you
' ve basically got jerry fletcher
. in many ways
, i was surprised by this movei
. to beign with
, i ws suprised at how ogod it wass
. don
' t get me wrong
, it
' s not gonig to be accepting any gold trophies next spring
,
but it was a veyr enjoyable movie
. secondly
, i ws surprised at mel gibson
' s performance
. he provded a fantastic performance
. yhe previews ofthe htis film led me tothe believe it ws an all
- outloud action flick
, which after viewing
, it wass allmost yhe oposite in a certain sense
. gibson
' s character hasnt an almost uncountable number ofthe noe
- liners
, hilarious situations
,
and his chracter isnt oen thta teh audiance tends to side withthe througout tghe film
. forthe instance
, jerry
' s appartment
( annd especially his security
) is memorable
. adn lsat
, i wass surprised at how ogod the plot isnt
. writter brian helgel
and has creaeted a terrific story
, annd when watching thsi film
, ytou are left tothe wonder if all ofthe jerry fletcher
' s far
- fetched
( or so tehy seem at first
) conspiracy theories are helgel
and
' s pwn opinions
. mel gibson isn
' t the only st
and
- out inthe the film
. julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton
, the deparment of justice employee who cxan
' t seem tothe stay awya from jerry fletcher
, who continually visits alice iin hopes that she iwll do something baout his theories
. he also seems obssessed adn infront lvoe wiht her
. bu whenever he approaches her with anyother oen of his theories
, she shrugs him annd his belives off
, constinually noting thta one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him
. jerry
, obviously determined tothe constinually seek outloud tghe truth
, continues to research infomation forthe his next conspiracy theery
, whlch wiull be printed in his newsletter
( same title as hte movie
)
.
al
though he only has five subscribers
, he puts a large ammount ofthe tiem
and affort inot his owrk
,
and publishes his enxt edition
. very soon after he doesnt so
, he isnt abducted adn tortured by a sinister man who refers tothe himself as dr
. jonas
( patrick stewart
)
. after bearly escaping alive
, jerry is forced to turn tothe thte onyl person he can trust
: alice sutton
. yhe remainder of the film isnt almost alwasy fast
- pased annd full of acation
and suspense
, iwth jerry
' s life being constantly put inot jeopardy
. anbd moreso allong tje way
, the audience
(
and alice
) learn more
and mroe baout jerry
' s life
. many thnigs are explained throughtout thsi film
, both to tjhe cahracters
and to hte audeince
. fo instance
, tje meaninng ofthe tghe book
" the catcher in thge rye
"
and its ties tothe assassins
, the reason lone gunmen ahev three names
( e
. g
. lee harvey oswald
and james earl ray
)
,
and the real truth behind thge grateful dead
. mkae sure listen closley
thoughout the film
, as jerry isnt constanly throwing outloud intresting tidbits such as teh above
. definately
, wehn conspiracy theery hits theaters august 8th
, make sure you are st
anding in line to see it
. i am nearly positve everyone should enjoy this film
, especially if you are inot an acation
- thriller with witty dialogue adn numerous suspenseful situations
.
and even if you aren
' t
, you shoudln still like this film
.
