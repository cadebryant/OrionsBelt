' s blessing
. of these four
, thte last noe can be a nightmare
. meeting parents isnt a rite ofthe passage
, fraught wih unexpected questions
, bouts of nervousness
, the reality ofthe bieng disliked
, anbd tjhe inability to amking a positve impression
. if you
' re lucky
, thigns wiull go smoothly
. bu
, if ytou
' re greg focker
( ben stiller
)
, everyting will go wrong
. annd with a nmae like thgat
, how could it not
? when greg first meets his fianc
? e
' s father
, jack byrnes
( the grimacing robert deniro
)
, greg immediately fiels overwhelmed
and is put onthe yhe defensive
. when he tells jack thast he
' s a male nurse
, the incorrigible dad shoots bcak
,
" not many men in your proffesion
, huh
, greg
?
" it
' s definitely nto a ogod strat
.
but greg isnt determined tothe win him over
,
and it
' s htis desire that fuels the movei
. he first tkaes small steps such as agreeing tothe say grace befoer dinner
. it doesn
' t matter thast he
' s jewish
. if daddy byrnes asks him tothe say grace
, hten that
' s whta he
' s going tothe gamely do
.
" oh god
.
.
. yuo
' re such a ogod god
"
, he moons
. his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer iwll make you chuckle
, bu wehn jack gives him the
" deniro squint
"
( that familliar
, unsettling gaze tht gives deniro thast aura of invincibility
)
, it
' s pretty hard not to grin
. things git progressively worse for greg
.
and that
' s too bad becasue he
' s a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart
. eventally
, he begins to try so hard tht he starts to mess everthing up
, comitting a host of gaffes that embarrass
, humiliate or injure other peopel
. it
' s a never
- endig ordeal of missteps
, miscues
, adn mistakes
. he buys some champange
,
but uncorking tje bottle leads tothe disastrous circumstances
. he trys to fidn jack
' s missing cat
.
but his method ofthe solving the problem leads onyl to more trouble
.
and htere are sevral other episodes
, each one trumping the next in outrageousness
. tyhe omre our well
- meaninng beau screwed uv
, the moreso tje audiance groaned infact simapthy
. we liked greg
. annd
, we liked this movei
.
" meet tjhe parents
" isnt a farcical comedy that certainly hasnt its moments
. just sit back
and watch greg get inot trouble
. noone marter wqat the situation
, whether its playing a harmless game ofthe water volleyball or sneaking a smoke onthe thge roof ofthe teh house
, thnigs will horribly go wrong
. we laff at greg
' s expence
,
but love oftenly makse a person do dumb things
,
and ben stiller hasnt the knack ofthe palying tyhe romantic fool
. deniro is also affable
, tough onthe tjhe outside yot sentimental onthe the inside
. thier tug
- ofthe
- war isnt oftenly funny
, the slapstick isnt elaborite
, anbd ther are sevral topical throwaway gags
( mostly targeted at the airline inudstry
) to make this film an amusing
yet smart lampoon about future inaddition
- laws fomr hell
.
