for any groom on the verge ofthe proposing marraige to his girlfriend
, ther are certain rules that he needs to folow
. firstly
, fill her life with happiness
and romance druing the courtship
. secondly
, buy her a beatiful ring thyat glitters as brightly as her eyes
. thirdly
, find hte perfect moent
adn loction tothe propose
. fianlly
, the groom
- wannabe shoudl probably git her pparent ' s blessing
. ofthe theese four
, the lsat noe cxan be a nightmare
. meeting parents isnt a rite ofthe passage
, fraught wih unexpected questions
, bouts ofthe nervousness
, thte reality of bieng disliked
,
adn the inability to mkea a postive impression
. if you ' re lucky
, things will go smoothly
.
but
, if ytou ' re greg focker
( ben stiller
)
, everything will go wrong
.
and with a nmae liuke that
, how could it nto
? whn greg first meets his fianc
? e ' s father
, jack byrnes
( thge grimacing robert deniro
)
, greg emmediately feels overwhelmed
and isnt put onthe hte defencive
. when he tells jack tyhat he ' s a male nurse
, the incorrigible dad shoots bakc
,
" not many men in your proffesion
, huh
, greg
?
" it ' s definitely nto a good start
.
bu greg is determined to win him over
,
and it ' s this desire taht fuels tjhe movie
. he frist takes small steps such as agreeing tothe sday grace before dinner
. it doesn ' t marter thgat he ' s jewish
. if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace
,
then tyhat ' s wqat he ' s going tothe gamely dont
.
" oh god
.
.
. you ' re such a good god
"
, he moons
. his discomfort at trying tothe force outloud a simple prayer iwll mkae ytou chuckle
,
bu when jack gives him teh
" deniro squint
"
( taht familiar
, unsettling gaze that gives deniro tyhat aura ofthe invincibility
)
, it ' s preety hard nto to grin
. thigns git progressively worse for greg
.
and tyhat ' s too bad beccause he ' s a genuinely likable guy with a rumatic heart
. eventually
, he begins tothe try so hard tht he starts tothe mess everything uv
, comiting a host of gaffes thgat embarrass
, humiliate or injure other people
. it ' s a never
- ending ordeal of missteps
, miscues
,
and mistakes
. he buys some champange
,
but uncorking yhe bottle leads to disastrous circumstances
. he trys to fidn jack ' s missing cat
.
bu his method ofthe solving hte problem leads only to more trouble
.
annd htere are several other episodes
, each one trumping the enxt infront outrageousness
. the moreso our well
- meaning beau screwed uv
, thte moreso the audience groaned in sympathy
. we liked greg
.
and
, we liked this movei
.
" meet the parents
" is a farcical comedy that certainly hasnt its moments
. jstu sit bakc
annd watch greg git into trouble
. noone marter what tje situation
, whther its palying a harmless agme of water voleyball or sneaking a smoke onthe hte roof of the hous
, thigsn will horribly go wrong
. we laff at greg ' s expence
,
bu lvoe oftenly makes a person dont dumb things
,
adn ben stiller hasnt the knack of palying the romantic fool
. deniro isnt also affable
, tough on the outside
yot sentimental onthe the inside
. thier tug
- of
- war isnt oftenly funny
, yhe slapstick isnt elaborite
,
and htere are several topical throwaway gags
( mostly targeted at tjhe airline inudstry
) to mkea this film an amusing
yet smart lampoon about future iin
- laws from hell
.
