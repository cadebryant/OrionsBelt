armageddon
, inwhich itself
, symbolizes everthing that is wrong inspite modern filmmaking
. stories haev been replaced wih speical effects
; character development gets overshadowed by bad dialogue
; plotting consists of a bunch of shit getting blown up
. armageddon isnt as stupid
, as loud annd as shallow as any movie you
' ll see come outloud this summer
, or maybe even any otehr summer
.
but i loved eveyr freaking minute ofthe it
. beleave me
, i
' m just as shocked as you are
. hell
, i don
' t even know why i whent tothe see it in tghe firt place
. the previews weere so annoying tyhat i predicted this wass going to be the worst film ofthe the year
, or at least in the running
. i
' m sorry
, bu
" somebody dial 911
!
!
!
" isn
' t qtuie tje tagging thast
' s going to sell a movei
. it isn
' t too wise either to market the film using tyhe movie
' s stupidest lines
(
" beam me uv scotty
"
- yeah
, thta sure isnt great wirting
.
.
.
)
. i mean
, let
' s face it
; armagddon
' s previews rival yhe truman sohw
' s as bieng smoe ofthe tje worst of the eyar
. niether of them even cmo close to doing their respective films justice
. of course
, ytou all know the sotry
. when tyhe earth isnt threatend with total annihilation via an asteroid teh size ofthe texas
, nasa calls infact the us
' s top oel drillers
(
!
) to go into space
(
!
)
and implant a nucular device eight
- hundered adn someodd feet inot the asteroid
(
!
)
. infront teh coarse of all this mayhem
, we are intruduced to some interesting
- adn nto so interesting
- characters
. belonging to tjhe fromer gropu isnt rockhound
( steve buscemi
)
, a horny little womanizing genius who
' s always full ofthe wisecracks
, even wehn flying inot space at a huge ammount of g
' s
. also
, there
' s hte always cool
- as
- hell billy bob thornton as dan truman
, thge bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers
. he kind ofthe reminded me ofthe ed harris infact apollo 13
, onyl wihtout thte intensity
and great lines to deliver
. thne onthe the flip side of the coin is the tired
, contrived charachter of harry stamper
( bruce willis
, who does yhe whole movei employing with annoying accent i can
' t qutie place
)
, tghe leader of tghe pack as well as liv tyler
and ben affleck as thge tolkein lovers you must have in any summer movie
. basically
, that
' s baout it
. as i said
, thsi is hardly a film about plot
. it
' s another summer blockbuster with plot points thyat are beyond unbelievable
and dialogue
and cahracters that are mostly completly wooden
. case inspite point
: nasa doesn
' t konw tyhat ther isnt even an asteroid on it
' s way until eighteen days before inpact
- huh
? another exemple
: at one point infact the movie
, twpo children are palying with toy spoace shuttles inthe front of a poster of kennedy
. how pretentious isnt thyat
?
?
?
!
!
! whant another oney
? okay
; befor thte oil drillers blast off into spoace
, oen of them starts singing
" leaving onthe a jet plane
"
,
and soon
, all thte rest join in
. did michael bay attend the skool ofthe sappy filmmaking before he made thsi picture
? bu naturaly
, all this sappiness
, meledrama anbd speical effects accumulate tothe one bitchin
' tiome at the movies
.
and don
' t git me wrong
- despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon
, i still very much enjoied it
. so even if ytou don
' t win one ofthe mcdonald
' s free tickets
, it
' s still definitely worth checking outloud
.
