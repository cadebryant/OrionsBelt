armageddo
, in itself
, symbolizes everything that is wrong inwhich modern filmmaking
. stories ahve been replaced with special effects
; chracter development gets overshaddowed by bad dialogue
; plotting consists ofthe a bunch ofthe shit getting blown uv
. armageddn isnt as stupid
, as loud
and as shallow as any movei yuo ' ll see come out thsi summer
, or mabye even any other summer
.
bu i loved eveyr freaking minute of it
. believe me
, i ' m just as shocked as ytou are
. hell
, i don ' t even konw why i went to see it inspite thte frist place
. thge previews weere so annoying thgat i predicted this was going tothe be the worst film ofthe tghe year
, or at least iin the running
. i ' m sorry
,
but
" somebody dial 911
!
!
!
" isn ' t qtuie thte tagging that ' s going to sell a movei
. it isn ' t too wise either tothe market the film useing the movie ' s stupidest lines
(
" beam me uv scotty
"
- yeah
, tyhat sure is great writing
.
.
.
)
. i mean
, let ' s face it
; armageddon ' s previews rival the truman sohw ' s as bieng some of thte worst ofthe hte year
. neither ofthe them even cmo close to doign thier respective films justice
. ofthe course
, yuo all know tjhe stoy
. whn teh earth is threatend with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas
, nasa calls in the us ' s top oil drillers
(
!
) to go into spoace
(
!
)
adn implant a nuclear divice eigth
- hundred
adn someodd foots inot the asteroid
(
!
)
. in thte coarse ofthe all htis mayhem
, we are intrduced to some interesting
-
annd not so intresting
- charactors
. belonging to hte former group isnt rockhound
( steve buscemi
)
, a horny littel womanizing genius who ' s always full ofthe wisecracks
, even whn flying into space at a huge ammount ofthe g ' s
. also
, ther ' s tje alwasy kool
- as
- hell billy bob thornton as dan truman
, thge bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers
. he kind of reminded me of ed harris inthe apollo 13
, only without yhe intensity
and great lines tothe deliver
.
thn on the flip side of tyhe coin isnt teh tired
, contrived charcter ofthe harry stamper
( bruce willis
, who doens thte wohle movie employing withthe annoying accent i can ' t qtuie palce
)
, yhe leader of the pack as well as liv tyler
and ben affleck as yhe token lovers you must hvae inwhich any summer movie
. basically
, thgat ' s baout it
. as i said
, this is hardly a film baout plot
. it ' s another summer blockbuster whith plot points that are beyond unbelievable
and dialogue
and characters thyat are mostly completly wooden
. case in point
: nasa doesn ' t know that htere isnt even an astroid on it ' s way until eighteen dyas before impact
- huh
? another exemple
: at one point in tyhe movie
, twpo children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy
. how pretentious is tht
?
?
?
!
!
! want anyother oen
? okay
; before the oil drillers blast off inot space
, oen of them starts singing
" leaving onthe a jet plane
"
,
and soon
, all yhe rest join inspite
. did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking befor he made this picture
?
but naturally
, all htis sappiness
, melodrama
and spacial effects accumulate tothe oen bitchin ' tiome at tyhe movies
.
and don ' t get me wrong
- dispite all of the thigsn i found wrong with armagdedon
, i still very much enjoyed it
. so even if you don ' t win oney of mcdonald ' s free tickets
, it ' s still definitly worth checking outloud
.
