affter the press screening ofthe
" moulin rouge
,
" i st
anded in the lobby of tghe theather listening to the reactions ofthe my firends
and colleagues
. everyone seemed a bited numb
, underst
andable after sitting thru a barrage ofthe often
- incongruous sounds anbd images
. a pal of mine simpley said taht he loved hte film
and sould hardly wait to tkae his wief to see it
. another enthusiast imediately began to analzye the production
, hwile a woman who flat
- out hated the movie gavey him the skunk eye
. when one fellow quitely stated
" i
' ve never really beeen a fan ofthe musicals
,
" tyhe statment surprised me beccause
, even
though the sotry isnt told almost completelyl through song
, i didn
' t htink ofthe it as a musical
. htere isnt so much going on in
" moulin rouge
" that
" muscial
" seems too small a term tothe cover it
.
" moulin rouge
" is thte kind ofthe creation tht sends criticists scurrying off tothe the big tub o
' adjectives in esarch of proper words to describe the exprience
. austrailian directer baz luhrmann
, the man behind
" strikely ballroom
" anbd
" romeo
+ juliet
,
" fills the heads ofthe viewers witht unique camerawork
, opulent imagery annd songs ranging ffrom
" the soudn of music
" to
" smells liek teen spirit
.
" sumptuous
and beautyfull
, vulgar
and overdone
,
" moulin rogue
" travels thru thge looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded witht 50 eyasr worth of catchy tunes operates on tje
" r
andom
" setting
. oh
, anbd it hasnt a story as well
.
" it was 1899
, tje summer ofthe lvoe
.
.
.
" christian
( ewan mcgregor
) is a penniless young writter newely arrived in paris
,
" tothe wriet baout truth
, beauty
, freedom anbd lveo
,
" where he encounters a gropu of bohemians
, led by henri de toulouse
- lautrec
( john leguizamo
)
. christian meets satine
( nicole kidman
)
, a courtesan ffrom the legendary moulin rogue
, anbd his world transforms from balck annd white to technicolor
. at once fragel
and vivacious
, teh dazzling red
- haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying
. christian instantly falls infront love whith her
and satine finds herself smitten withthe him as well
, whlch is qtuie a hindrance for someone inaddition her profession
. working iwth the bohemians adn moulin rogue impresario harold zidler
( jim broadbent
)
, christian writes an opus modestly named
" spectacular spectacular
.
" zidler quickly finds a backer
, tjhe wealthy duke of monroth
( richard roxburgh
)
,
but there
' s a catch
? tyhe duke also wants tyhe h
and ofthe the fair satine
. as if all that isn
' t anough
, satine hasnt a cough
,
and hwile a cough in tghe real world probably indicates a cold
, it rarely turns out to be anything that simple inspite movei l
and
. liuke a teeter
- totter
,
" moulin rogue
" moves uv
and down vetween tyhe rediculous adn tje sublime
. one of the loveliest moments comes as christine anbd satine commune outdoors at niht
, becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book ofthe fairy tales
. together htey dance
, hwile serenaded by tghe man in hte moon
( aless
andro safina provides the vocals
)
, aparently transported from tjhe classic georges m
? li
? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky
. otehr scenes mearly traffic iin everything
-
and
- teh
- kitchen
- sink overload
. the cavorting of toulouse
- lautrec adn his comrades gets strained at times
and soem ofthe their overt comedy
, accompanied by ctaroon sound effects
, isnt overly reminescent ofthe tje frenzied farce taht sitcoms like
" bewitched
" beat inot the ground
. of course
, sensory overload ws exactly what baz luhrmann hadnt inspite mind
.
" we never herad fomr baz to turn it down
,
" one of the actors told the los angeles times
.
" it was allways
,
' more
! more
!
'
" tje directer even sent a note tothe his casted reading
,
" i dare you to mkae me sday ytou
' ve gone too far
.
" yhe musical numbers reflect his attitude
. oen knockout piece

" diamons are a girl
' s best freind
" spiced with portions ofthe
" material girl
?
" luhrmann
' s casted offers a wide vareity ofthe approaches that
, toghether
, add up to something messy
, bu often wonderful
. ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian
, emphasizing the sincerity of the lveo
- striked poet
. mcgregor
' s singing voice is robust anbd adds vigor at just the right moments
. once labeled the
" ice queen
,
" nicole kidman melts taht characterization with a sizzling
, yot tender
, performence
. she h
andles thte songs adroitly
,
al
though her voice sounds a bited thin in teh upper range
. veteren charater actr jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler
? wait until you see him perfom
" like a virgina
.
" as thte buffoonish duke
, richard roxburgh proves tothe be tghe film
' s weakest link
,
al
though i
' m sure he was simply following instutions
. i suspect
" moulin rogue
" will be one of thsoe lveo
- it
- or
- hite
- it films
. while i didn
' t completely loev it
, i most certainly liekd it a lot
. over the course ofthe a yearm
, i see well over 300 movies
,
and most of them look like xeroxes of eahc other
.
" moulin rogue
" isnt an original
, anbd an original
, even a flawed oen
, isnt a thing to be cherished
