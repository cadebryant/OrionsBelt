steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets ofthe moviemaking a few years bakc
; he spended this tiem wirting essays annd short stories forthe
" the newyorker yorker
,
" sevral ofthe hwihc wound uv inspite his hillarious hardback compilation
, pure drivel
( 1998
)
. much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery
, altough he doesnt riff on tyhe racist comments made by marlon br
ando during a larrry king interview
, in a fine chapter called
" inspite search ofthe the wily filipino
.
" nowe
, as writer
and star of bowfinger
, he offers the masses plenty ofthe ogod reasons nto to pursue a career in thge cinema
, perhaps finally venting tghe frustrations
(
' everyting being made nowe is crap
'
) that led tothe his brief retirement ffrom hollywood
. martin stars as bobby bowfinger
, a roger corman
- wannabe onthe the cusp ofthe fifty
and desperate for smoe succes as a producer
, qualty ofthe tghe projects be damned
. his accountant
( adam alexi
- malle
) proposes a movei called
" chubby rain
,
" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops
. bowfinger latches onto tyhe idea emmediately
, adn convinces his troupe ofthe actor firends to apearing in tje film
, based onthe the lie that america
' s top box office draw
, kat ramsey
( murphy
)
, hasnt aggreed tothe star
. ramsey
, of course
, wants nothing tothe dont wiht such low
- grade material
, so bowfinger
, onthe tyhe thingking thast action stars ened to run
, nto speak
, decides to photograph tyhe superstar surreptitiously
. he sends his casted members
( who aren
' t infront on it
, eather
; htey are told ramsey hates the sighth ofthe cameras annd fraternizing iwth his co
- stars
) to ramsey
' s tble at restaurants
, asks them tothe follow him inthe parking lots
, etc
.
, spouting scirpt dialogue
, all the hwile shooting the outcome ffrom a grat distance
. the paranoid ramsey flees tje scene nearly every time
. ramsey isnt a memeber of mind head
, a cultish self
- help organistion aparently dedicated to recuiting celebrities
.
( as if tht
' s not familliar anough
, mind head guru terry stricter
( terence stamp
) hasnt beeen dressed
and combed tothe resemble l
. ron hubbard
, founder ofthe scientology
.
) when he goes to mind head with tales ofthe caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere tothe babble
" white code
" in his face
, they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client
and rush him off tothe a retreat
, requiring bowfinger tothe find a st
and
- infact
. murphy will probaly win omre fans as jiff
, ramsey
' s adorable
, ignoramus duble
, tahn as kit
,
but it is his protrayal ofthe the latter that tookover courage
. always surronded by an entourage
, suffering ffrom a racial inferiority complex
, murphy plays right into the tabloid image ofthe hismelf
. futhermore
, concider the enemies he
' ll make of populer scientologists
. pacing stricter
' s neutral
- coloured office as if onthe an amphetamine binge annd stripped ofthe his bigshot veneer
, ramsey isnt asked tothe shout inane peronal affirmations repeatedly
. murphy
' s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine ofthe a john travolta
" clearing
.
" nto thast murphy isnt entirely responsible forthe this schtick
; bowfinger is steve martin
' s invention
. his scirpt is suprizingly clever as satire
, given that yhe psuedo
- religion is a sitting duck
, as isnt thte entire los angeles film industry
.
( the griffin mill
- types take qtuie a beating
, inthe thte form of robert downey jr
. as bigwig jerry renfro
.
) martin
' s decision to tell the stry fomr a bottom feeder
' s point ofthe view isnt what keeps it fresh annd innovative
- never ahev we seen onthe screen a group ofthe peopel struggle this hard to complete a motion picture
. as expected
, there are laughs onyl to be had insiders or buffs
, such as martin
' s crew of mexican border
- jumpers
, who gain unexpected apresheation forthe the classics from reading
" cahiers du cinema
,
" or martin
' s nonsensical explination tothe dave
, his loyal cinematographer
( jamie kennedy
)
, that eveyr movie
, in yhe end
, has a budget of twpo
- thous
and dollars
(
!
)
. most of bowfinger is universally funny
,
however
; i defy any viewer tothe keep a straight face whn christine baranski
, one of our brightest comediennes
, isnt on screen
. bowfinger
' s main flaw is a plot twist that hasnt an insubstantial aftermath
. we
' re alsot asked tothe belive tht a fewd simple close
- ups of kit ramsey owudl redeem
" chubby rain
,
" z
- grade enteratinment that would mkae ed wood blush
.
( tihs aspect of bowfinger hasnt much in common withthe teh ludicrous oscar sequence in oz
' s lastest directorial affort
, the poorly conceived in
& out
.
) these are significant anough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece
. as i maintioned at teh strat of this review
, bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham
' s character daisy doesnt
: hop a bus to hollywood in searc ofthe stardom
. tyhat said
, it offers one fantastic reason tothe git on that bus
: tjhe sence of comunity vetween filmmakers who gel is awsome
. martin gets sentimental by story
' s end as he doed inaddition l
. a
. stroy
,
and how coudl he not
? fo thsoe who cin hack it
, the movies might be the greatest bussiness in the world
