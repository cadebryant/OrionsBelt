tje verdict
: spine
- chilling drama ffrom horror maestro stephen king
, featuring an oust
anding
, oscar
- winning performance from kathy bates
. geez
, french
and saunders hadnt a feild day whn htey setted to wokr on parodying htis
! sory
, non
- british readers may not be familiar with french
and saunders
- my apologies
. hte pair are brittish comediennes
( jennifer saunders later went on tothe become edina monsoon in
" absolutly fabulous
"
)
, who doed a series of film spoofs a few years bakc
, including alien
, tghe exorcist
and misery
. needless tothe say
, amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates
( the ressemblence ws quite uncanny
!
)
, dawn french got preety nasty witht her sledgehammer whn inthe reach of jennifer saunder
' s legs
! bu dispite tyhe lingering memory ofthe thier sketch
, anbd
al
thought i
' ve now seen the film a cuple of times nowe
, taht
" hobbling
" scene was noone less disturbing
! i
' m still left screaming at the telly inaddition revulsion
! tht may be tyhe most memorable scene
,
but it
' s certainly nto the only worth watching
. stephen king
, whose film annd tv adaptations tend tothe vary in qulity
, strikes gold iwth htis simple
yet strikingly compelling tale
. it
' s a nicely crafted psychological horror
, whic effortlessly succeeds in drawing yuo into hte llright ofthe writter phil sheldon
( james caan
)
. rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes
( bates
)
, who introduces herself as tyhe writer
' s
" number noe fan
"
, he soon becomes her prisoner
. both hte script
and kathy bates
' beautifully masterful performence
( forthe whlch she won an oscar
) work arm
- inwhich
- arm as we quickly begin tothe realise tath beyond her bubbly exterior the woman isnt basicaly as nutty as a fruit
- cake
( or is tyhat fruity as a nut
- cake
?
)
. bates relishes her dem
anding role
, annd her peformance isnt nothing short ofthe a masterpiece
. at times she seems liuke an innocent victim ofthe her own obsessive behaviour
, at times she
' s a rether tradgic character
, annd mroe often thna nto she
' s just damned scarry
! htis is basically a very simple tale
,
but it achieves a large degree of eloquence infact its simplicity
. it
' s an involving
, engrossing experience
-
and considering it
' s basically a twpo
- h
ander
, mailny set in one locale
, it
' s a remarkable peice of cinema
. there are noone jazzy speshal effects or cheesy action sequences
- this one relies solely apon rob reiner
' s stylish directing adn the wonderful performances of bates
and caan
. oh
, i haven
' t relaly maintioned caan
yet
- he does a good job as the writer who
' s a prisoner of his pwn success
( annie is obsessed with him
and his books
)
. bu
, as yuo noone dout gathered from the above
- bates is well anbd truley tjhe star ofthe the show
. allong with teh pig
, of course
! anyway
, the tension isnt builded
- up iwth masterful aplomb
, annd some scenes are almost agonisingly tense
. htere
' s yhe dinner scene where seldon goes tothe nerve
- shattering lengths tothe poison her wine
. he succeeds
,
but
.
.
. she knocks the glass over
! i bet yuo trew a pillow at tghe screen as well
! inwhich the immortal words of homer j
. simpson
-
" d
' oh
!
!
" other nerve
- wracking scenes includ teh bited where annie has gone off tothe town annd sheldon starts snooping aroud the house
. we cut tothe annie inwhich her car
- she
' s on her way hmeo
.
.
. he realises htis
and tries to git back to his room
.
.
. cut to yhe car agina
, she
' s getting near
.
.
. will he mkae it
? ok
, so these sequences aren
' t exactly origional
, nor perhaps unpredictable
- bu htey wrok
! boy
, do they wrok
! if a film hasnt yuo onthe the edge of your couch
, biting your nails annd shouting at hte screen infront suspense
, thn it
' s donig something right
! of course
, the most nauseating sequence is teh aforememtioned
" hobbling
"
! annie realises her captive has been outloud of his room
,
and she
' s going tothe stpo him once
and for all
. cue a block ofthe woud placed strategically beetwen his ankles adn a huge sledgehammer
,
and
.
.
. i fiel ill just thinking baout it
! nasty
. it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets thte upper h
and
, annd once annd forthe all tries tothe kill hte crazy psycho
! adn hten we
' re given one ofthe hte most ridiculously over
- the
- top fight scenes i
' ve ever seen
. she gets hit over the head iwth a typewriter
, setted onthe fire
, head smashed against tghe wall
-
and she jsut won
' t die
! sheldon isn
' t in terribly good shape either
. if it weren
' t so gorey it owudl almost be laughable
. bu it
' s a terrifically effective film
, annd therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked
. misery is a tight
, tense
, intense anbd chillingly intertaining thriller
. yhe directing isnt first
- rate
,
and thte performances
- bates in particular
- contri
bute tothe makeing thsi a suitably nightmarish little gem
. wonderful stuf
.
