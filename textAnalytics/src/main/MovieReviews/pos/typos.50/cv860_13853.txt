tghe verdict
: spine
- chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king
, featuring an outstanding
, oscar
- winning peformance from kathy bates
. geez
, french
and saunders had a field day whn tehy set to owrk onthe parodying thsi
! sory
, non
- british readers may not be familiar with french
anbd saunders
- my apologies
. tje pair are british comediennes
( jennifer saunders later whent on tothe become edina monsoon in
" absolutely fabulous
"
)
, who did a series of film spoofs a faw yeras back
, includng aline
, thge exorcist
anbd misery
. needless to sday
, amidst her chucklesome impersonation ofthe kathy bates
( teh resemblance wass qtuie uncanny
!
)
, dawn french got preety nasty wtih her sledgehammer when in triarch ofthe jennifer saunder ' s legs
!
bu dispite the lingering memory of their sketch
,
and
although i ' ve nowe seen tyhe film a couple of times nowe
, thgat
" hobbling
" scene was noone less disturbing
! i ' m still left screaming at the telly in revulsion
! that may be the most memorable scene
,
bu it ' s certainly not the onyl worth watching
. stephen king
, whose film
annd tv adaptations tend tothe vary inwhich uqality
, strikes gold iwth this simple
yet strikingly compelling tale
. it ' s a nicely crafted psychological horror
, whcih effortlessly suceeds infact drawing you inot tje llright of writter phil sheldon
( james caan
)
. rescued ffrom a car accident by annie wilkes
( bates
)
, who introduces herself as thte writer ' s
" number oen fan
"
, he soon becomes her prisoner
. both the scirpt
annd kathy bates ' beautifully masterful performence
( fo whic she won an oscar
) work arm
- in
- arm as we quickly beign tothe realise tath beyond her bubbly exterior tje woman is basicaly as nutty as a fruit
- cake
( or is thgat fruity as a nut
- cake
?
)
. bates relishes her demanding role
,
and her performance isnt nothing short of a masterpiece
. at times she seems like an innocent victum of her own obsessive behaviour
, at times she ' s a rether tradgic character
,
anbd omre oftenly than not she ' s jsut damned scary
! this isnt basically a vrey simple tale
,
but it acheives a larg degree ofthe eloquence in its simplicity
. it ' s an involving
, engrossing expeience
-
and concidering it ' s basicaly a two
- hander
, mailny setted in oney locale
, it ' s a remarkable peice ofthe cinema
. there are no jazzy spacial effects or cheesy acation sequences
- this one relies solely upon rob reiner ' s stylish directing
and the wonderful performances of bates
and caan
. oh
, i haven ' t raelly mentioned caan
yot
- he does a ogod job as hte writter who ' s a prisoner of his pwn success
( annie is obsessed with him
and his books
)
.
but
, as you no dout gathered ffrom the above
- bates is well
and truly the star ofthe yhe sohw
. along with yhe pig
, ofthe course
! anyway
, the tension is builded
- up wih masterful aplomb
,
and smoe scenes are almsot agonisingly tense
. ther ' s yhe dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve
- shattering lengths tothe posion her wine
. he succeeds
,
bu
.
.
. she knocks tjhe glass over
! i bet ytou threw a pillow at the screen as well
! in tyhe immortal words ofthe homer j
. simpson
-
" d ' oh
!
!
" otehr nerve
- wracking scenes inlcude the bit where annie hasnt gone off to town
and sheldon starts snooping arund yhe hous
. we cutted tothe annie in her car
- she ' s on her way home
.
.
. he realises this
and trys tothe git back to his room
.
.
. cutted tothe the car again
, she ' s getting near
.
.
. wiull he mkea it
? ok
, so these sequences aren ' t exactlly orginal
, nor perhaps unpredictable
-
but tehy owrk
! boy
, do they wokr
! if a film hasnt you on thte edge ofthe your couch
, biting your nails
anbd shouting at teh screen in suspense
,
thn it ' s doign something right
! of course
, thte most nauseating sequence is tje aforememtioned
" hobbling
"
! annie realises her captive has beeen outloud ofthe his room
,
anbd she ' s going to stop him once
and fo all
. cue a block of woud placed stratagically vetween his ankles
annd a huge sledgehammer
,
annd
.
.
. i efel ill just thikning baout it
! nasty
. it all builds uv nicely tothe the fianl scene where sheldon fianlly gets yhe opper hand
,
anbd once
and forthe all trys to kill yhe crazy psycho
!
and
hten we ' re given oney ofthe tjhe most ridiculously over
- the
- top fight scenes i ' ve ever seen
. she gets hitted over the head with a typewriter
, setted onthe fire
, head smashed against the wall
-
and she just won ' t dieu
! sheldon isn ' t in terribly good shape either
. if it weren ' t so gorey it woudl alomst be laughable
.
but it ' s a terrifically effective film
,
adn therefore thge daft climax is easily overlooked
. misery isnt a tight
, tense
, intense
and chillingly intertaining thriller
. tjhe directing isnt first
- rate
,
and the performances
- bates in particular
- contibute to making htis a suitably nightmarish little gme
. wonderful stuf
.
