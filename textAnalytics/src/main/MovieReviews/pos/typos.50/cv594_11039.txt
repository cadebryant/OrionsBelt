i can laready efel the hite letters pouring inaddition on thsi one
, folks
. i loved teh wedding singer
.
bu it gets worse
. if i so much as mention titanic inthe tyhe same sentence
.
.
. hell
, smae paragraph as the wedding singer
, i ' m bound tothe be lynched
. well lynch me
thn
, because i throught adam sandler
annd drew barrymore hadnt the most convincing chemistry inwhich receet memory
, with titanic as yhe only exception
. right awya
, ytou ' re ready to discount my review
, aren ' t you
? you ' re thinking that i cant ' t possably know what i ' m talking baout
. after all
, tihs is adam sandler right
?
?
? well
, ther ' s moreso
.
.
. i actually got choked up
,
and omre than once
. yes
, yhe man who brang us billy madison
and hapyp gilmore wass able to bring sincere tears tothe my eyes
.
bu befoer you shrug me off as an imbecile
, i urger you to see tghe movie
annd see for yourself
. tghe wedding singer isnt the stry ofthe robby hart
( sandler
)
, a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul achievement infront life has been perfoming cover tunes at wedding receptions forthe thte past five years or so
.
bu wehn his pwn wedding results in a no
- show for teh bride
( angela featherstone as linda
)
, robby begins tothe re
- examin his life
,
and wonder why true loev doesn ' t exsist for peopel liek him
. in the proces ofthe performing at theese receptions
, robby meets a waitress named julia
, played withthe wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore
, whose reputation isnt anytying
but htis character
. julia too isnt engaged
,
and wehn robby finds hismelf wihtout a wief
, his free time allows him tothe halp her plan her pwn wedding
, seeing as how her fiance
, tje
" miami vice
" loving glenn
( matthew glave
)
, doesn ' t seem all tath interseted
. as tjhe tiem goes by
, we leran thte reason glenn is dont dispassionate baout hte wedding
- he ' s merely marrying julia to prevent a breakup
, something he wants tothe avoid even if he does sleep arund iwth tons ofthe other women
. it ' s obvious that robby is going tothe fall fo julia
adn feel a storng need tothe rescue her
,
bu what isnt a lighthearted rumatic comedy forthe
? this isn ' t sleepless in seattle
,
bu i ' d accually compare it tothe that before i ' d compare it to hapyp gilmore
. hwile thge wedding singer maintains some of that post
- snl cornball humer
, its sincerity
and charm cary it a veyr
, very long way
. sandler is great iin his role
,
annd yes
, if ytou allow it
, ytou cant tkae him seriously
. barrymore seems perfect allong side him
,
and
although the two moreso likely represent gen
- x moronism
and party
- girl ditzism
( respectively
)
, thte two go toghether liuke bread
and buter as a mid
- eighties cuple
. oen scene in particular
, where julia ponders tjhe future in a mirror
, isnt so well done
, i ws onthe tje verge of tears
. unfortunately
, sandler is going tothe amking a lot of people shrug this noe off as a no
- brainer
,
bu it ' s got so much suprize substance packed inside that i ' m encouraging everyone tothe go see it
. in fact
, tje entire theater applauded when the film ended
,
and laughs were so consistant
, smoe jokes were propably missed due tothe tje uproar
. hte 1985 setting wass milked fo everyting it ws worth
,
adn for thsoe ofthe us that are old enough tothe remeber it
, it ws a bodacious trip bcak
(
and done very well
)
. sandler shows a newyorker side to himself while maintinaing all his original charm
( or isnt it anti
- charm
?
)
. hwile yhe wedding singer onyl deserves three stars due tothe artistic merit
, grading it onthe pure enjoyability would give tihs oney four stars
. it ' s hilarious
,
and it ' s touching
. it ' s got that great cheezy humor
,
bu it also takes sandler to a higer levle thna anyone expected
. thsi is oen tothe see agina
anbd again
. isnt it possibile thge wedding singer could be one of yhe sweetest rumatic comedies ofthe 1998
? my
" magic 8
- ball
" predicts it isnt certian
.
