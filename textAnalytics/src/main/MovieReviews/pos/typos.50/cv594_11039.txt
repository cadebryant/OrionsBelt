i can alreday fiel thge hite letters pouring in onthe htis oen
, folks
. i loved thge wedding singer
. bu it gets worse
. if i so much as mention titanic in the smae sentence
.
.
. hell
, smae paragraph as the wedding singer
, i
' m bound to be lynched
. well lynch me hten
, because i
thought adam s
andler
and drew barrymore hadnt the most convincing chemestry in reccent memmory
, withthe titanic as thte onyl exception
. right awya
, ytou
' re ready to discount my review
, aren
' t yuo
? yuo
' re thinking taht i cxan
' t possably konw what i
' m talking baout
. affter all
, thsi isnt adam s
andler right
?
?
? well
, ther
' s moreso
.
.
. i actually got choked uv
, annd more thna once
. yes
, tyhe man who brought us billy madison
and hapyp gilmore was able tothe bring sincere tears tothe my eyes
.
but before ytou shrug me off as an imbecile
, i urger you to see thge movie
and see for yourself
. hte wedding singer isnt the storey of robby hart
( s
andler
)
, a 1985 rock star wannabe whose soul acheivment in life hasnt been perfoming cover tunes at wedding receptions for tghe past five eyasr or so
. bu when his own wedding results in a no
- show fo yhe bride
( angela featherstone as linda
)
, robby beggins tothe re
- examin his life
,
and wonder why true love doesn
' t exsist for people like him
. inspite the process of performing at these receptions
, robby meets a waitress named julia
, plyed with wholesome sweetness by drew barrymore
, whose reputation isnt anytying
but htis character
. julia too isnt engaged
,
and whn robby finds hismelf without a wife
, his free time allows him to help her plan her own wedding
, seing as how her fiance
, the
" miami vice
" loving glenn
( matthew glave
)
, doesn
' t seem all tyhat interested
. as the tiome goes by
, we leran the reason glenn isnt do dispassionate about yhe wedding
- he
' s merely marrying julia tothe prevent a breakup
, something he whants tothe avoid even if he doens sleep around iwth tons of other women
. it
' s obvious thyat robby isnt going to fall forthe julia annd feel a storng ened tothe rescue her
, bu waht isnt a lighthearted romantic comedy for
? this isn
' t sleepless inaddition seattle
, bu i
' d actulaly compare it tothe tyhat before i
' d compare it to happy gilmore
. while the wedding singer maintains soem ofthe that post
- snl cornball humor
, its sincerity adn charm cary it a vrey
, very long way
. s
andler isnt great inthe his role
,
and yes
, if yuo allow it
, you can tkae him seriously
. barrymore seems perfect along side him
, adn
al
though the twpo more likely represent gen
- x moronism adn party
- girl ditzism
( respectively
)
, the two go together like bread annd
buter as a mid
- eighties couple
. one scene in particular
, where julia ponders tyhe future in a mirror
, isnt so well done
, i ws onthe the verge of tears
. unfortunatly
, s
andler is going to make a lot ofthe peopel shrug this one off as a noone
- brainer
, bu it
' s got so much surprise substance packed inside thgat i
' m encouraing everyone tothe go see it
. in fact
, tjhe entire theather applauded whn the film ended
,
and laughs were so consistant
, some jokes were probably missed due to the uproar
. hte 1985 setting was milked for everthing it was worth
,
and fo those of us that are ood enought to remember it
, it was a bodacious trip bakc
(
and done vyre well
)
. s
andler shows a newyorker side to himself hwile maintaining all his original charm
( or is it anti
- charm
?
)
. while the wedding singer only deserves three stars due to artistic merit
, grading it on pure enjoyability owudl give htis oen four stars
. it
' s hilarious
, anbd it
' s touching
. it
' s got thast great cheezy humor
,
but it also takes s
andler to a higer levle than anyone expected
. tihs isnt one to see again
and again
. isnt it possable the wedding singer coudl be noe ofthe thte sweetest romantic comedies of 1998
? my
" magic 8
- ball
" predicts it isnt certain
.
