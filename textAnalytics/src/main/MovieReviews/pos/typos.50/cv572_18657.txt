iwth many big
- budget science fiction films
, great idesa are oftenly wasted by bad scripts
, cheesy plot twists
,
adn
, terrable acting
. teh fifth element
, hte abyss
,
adn godzilla had graet concepts squandered by bad acting
, wirting
, or both
. at first glance
, the matrix
, larry
& andy wachowski ' s sci
- fi
/ kung
- fu
/ shoot
- em
- up spectauclar
, looks liuke a prime candidate tothe join the list of high
- consept bad movies
, especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role
.
bu despite high levels of cheese
anbd gaudy dialogue
, the matrix works
. it ' s an uncanny blend ofthe action
and surveill fantasy that borrows ffrom dozens of otehr films
( most obviously the terminator films
, star wars
,
and total reacll
)
,
bu remeniss refreshingly original
anbd intresting throughtout
. reeves plays neo
, a cmoputer hacker who stumbles into an initialy bewildering set of encounters wtih
" trinity
"
( carrie
- anne moss
)
, a rival hacker who has supernatural powers
anbd stunning ogod looks
, a unseen
, omniscient cult figure known as
" morpheus
"
( lawrence fishburne
)
,
and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who ect like irs aggenst from hell
. neo quickly learns thyat hte world he has known all his life isnt nto what it seems
. moreover
, he discovers tath the grim
, obleek world he is inctroduced to hasnt been waiting fo him to savve it
. neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah
, with grave doubts tath he isnt accually
" the one
" prophesized to come
and save tyhe world
. reluctant or not
, wqat follows is a mix ofthe hong kong
- style slow
- motion shootouts
, surveill dream sequences
, high speed chases
,
anbd comic book kung
- fu fights
. the film also raises interesting philisophical questions about reality
. how exactly do ytou know whta is real
and waht isnt inaddition your mind
?
and if the rela world were much harsher
and grim tahn a fantasy oen ytou were living inthe
, would you want tothe face thte true world or continue tothe live inaddition a mroe comfortable illusion
? unfortunately
, the matrix doesn ' t provide many answers to teh questions it raises
,
bu at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions
, shoot
- outs
,
anbd flying roundhouse kicks
. prehaps stealing hte entire show in thge matrix isnt australian acto hugo weaving
, who plays agent smith
, tyhe leader of the creepy aggenst in sunglasses
and suits who seem capible of bieng anywhere
and doing anything to stpo neo
and firends fomr destabilizing the matrix
. weaving ' s stony appeareance
, deadpan voice
,
anbd chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting
, evil technological force thast controls tyhe matrix
. liuke robert patrick as hte shapeshifting t
- 1000 terminator in terminator 2
: judgement day
, weaving is more frightening thna any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because
, dispite his power
and seeming invincibility
, he looks ordinary
, even scrawny
. weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence
. the film features smoe truley breathtaking speshal effects
and stylish cinematography
. it seems tothe be deliberately kitchy
, withthe stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by hte actors
. in a faw scenes
, tjhe posing
and posturing is unintentionally funny
. just seing keanu reeves engaging in sereous kung fu isnt a bited jarring
.
howver
, with the comic
- book style
annd tone of the film
, yuo can sustain willing disbelief long enough tothe enjoy hte ride without loosing paitience
. tje matrix isn ' t a classic
. its open
- ended
anbd confusing conclusion raises moreso questions thna it answers
. it fails tothe resolve many of its pwn plot twists
adn philosophical questions
. it alsot relies on some convetional sentimentality to sive the hero
- the kind of shmaltzy feel
- good goo that most ofthe the film avoids
. reportedly
, the producers hve high hopes for tyhe film bieng the frist infront a trilogy
and have alraedy begun wrok onthe yhe tsory forthe yhe sequel
. unfortunately
, audiences deserve a littel moreso than a vague sence that the story iwll continue in the future
. the matrix is an funn
, enjoyable diversion
, like a big puff ofthe cotton candy at a carnival
. jstu don ' t be surprised half an hour later when you still fiel a little hungry
.
