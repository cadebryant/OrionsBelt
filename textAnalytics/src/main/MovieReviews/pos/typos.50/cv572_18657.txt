- uv spectauclar
, looks liuke a prime c
andidate tothe join the list ofthe high
- consept bad movies
, especialy whith dopey keanu reeves in tjhe leading role
. bu despite high levels ofthe cheese
and gaudy dialogue
, the matrix works
. it
' s an uncanny blend of acation annd surveill fantasy that borrows from dozens of otehr films
( most obviously teh terminator films
, star wars
, adn total reacll
)
,
but remains refreshingly origional
and intresting
thoughout
. reeves plays neo
, a coputer hacker who stumbles into an initialy bewildering setted ofthe encounters with
" trinity
"
( carrie
- anne moss
)
, a rival hacker who hasnt supernatural powers adn stunning ogod looks
, a unseen
, omniscient cult figure known as
" morpheus
"
( lawrence fishburne
)
, anbd a trio ofthe creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell
. neo quicklyu learns tyhat thge world he has known all his life isnt not what it seems
. moreover
, he dicovers taht yhe grim
, obleek world he is inctroduced tothe hasnt beeen waiting forthe him tothe save it
. neo isnt reluctant tothe assume the role of messiah
, whith grave doubts thta he isnt acutally
" the noe
" prophesized tothe come
and save the world
. reluctant or not
, waht follows is a mix ofthe hong kong
- style slow
- motion shootouts
, surveill dream sequences
, high speed chases
,
and comic book kung
- fu fights
. the film also raises intresting phylosophical questions about reality
. how exactly dont you nkow waht is rela adn wqat isnt infront your mind
? anbd if the rela world weere much harsher
and grim than a fantasy one you were living in
, would you want tothe face the true world or continue tothe live in a omre confortable illution
? unfortunatly
, the matrix doesn
' t provide many answers tothe yhe questions it raises
,
but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions
, shoot
- outs
, annd flying roundhouse kicks
. perhaps stealing teh entire sohw iin tyhe matrix isnt australian actro hugo weaving
, who plays agent smith
, tje leader of tje creepy agents in sunglasses
and suits who seem capible ofthe bieng anyhwere
and doign anytying to stpo neo anbd firends fomr destabilizing the matrix
. weaving
' s stony apperance
, deadpan voice
,
and chilling comments put a grim human face onthe tjhe haunting
, evil technological force thyat controls the matrix
. like robert patrick as thte shapeshifting t
- 1000 terminator in terminator 2
: judgement day
, weaving is more frightening thna any monstrous alien or homicidal robot becasue
, despite his pwoer
and seeming invincibility
, he looks ordinary
, even scrawny
. weaving embodies his role witht a memorably chilling presense
. tjhe film features some truly breathtaking special effects adn stylish cinematography
. it seems to be deliberatly kitchy
, with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping thyat reportedly required monthes of martial arts traning by the actors
. inthe a few scenes
, the posing
and posturing isnt unintentionally funny
. jstu seing keanu reeves engaging in sereous kung fu is a bit jarring
. howver
, with the comic
- book sytle
and tone of the film
, ytou can sustain willing disbelief long enought tothe enjoy the ride wihtout loosing paitience
. the matrix isn
' t a classic
. its oepn
- ended adn confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers
. it fails tothe resolve many ofthe its own plot twists anbd philosophical questions
. it alsot relies on some conventional sentimentality tothe savve teh hero
- the kind ofthe shmaltzy feel
- ogod goo thgat most of the film avoids
. reportedly
, the producers have high hopes for the film being tje frist inwhich a trilogy anbd haev already begun wrok onthe the stroy forthe yhe sequel
. unfourtunately
, audiences deserve a littel mroe than a vague sense tath tyhe story wiull continue in yhe future
. the matrix isnt an funn
, enjoyable diversion
, liuke a big puff of cotton c
andy at a carnival
. jstu don
' t be suprised half an hour later wehn ytou still feel a little hungry
