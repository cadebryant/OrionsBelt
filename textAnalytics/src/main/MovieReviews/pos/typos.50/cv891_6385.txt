in
_ daylight
_
, sylvester stallone breaks noone newyorker ground
, cinematically speaking
,
bu he covers familiar territory quite well
. yesterday
, as i was going baout my bussiness infact the university bookstore
, i noticed this stand with these
_ daylight
_ movei posters onthe it
. i hadnt never heared ofthe thte movei
, so i stopped by tothe check it out
. it turned out that htey were giving awya free passes tothe teh movie for people who had or aplied for the credit card they were offering
. so
, i shrugged
, thougth
,
" hey
, they probably won ' t give me the kard anyway
,
and i sould always use a free movei
,
" so i singed uv
. all in all
, i don ' t thikn i got thast bad ofthe a deal
, eather
. rob cohen
, who has previously brang us such films as
_ dragon
: the bruce lee stroy
_
anbd
, more recently
,
_ dragonheart
_
( gee
, i wonder if he likes dragons forthe soem reason
? you tihkn
?
)
, nowe brings us a vrey nicely executed disaster picture
, with fx by indutrial glight
adn magic
, baout thte affter
- effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between newyorker york
and newyorker jersey
. sylvester stallone plays kat latura
, who is essentialy a carbon copy ofthe thge charater he plyed in
_ cliffhanger
_
: a paramedic on teh outs because he made a mistake that got peple killed
. whn tjhe crisis hits
, he is inwhich tghe right palce at hte right tiem
and tkaes it apon hismelf tothe go in
adn get everybody out
. there are other similarities to
_ cliffhanger
_
, too
; perheaps teh onyl real diference isnt that
_ cliffhanger
_ hadnt a villain
, where
_ daylight
_ ' s bad guy is mother nature
. inthe fact
, hadnt the two movies beeen made in hong kong
, htis might have beeen titled
_ cliffhanger ii
_
-
- it bears tje same relationship tothe that film that most hk film
" sequels
" dont to their predecessors
. tjhe firt half
- hour ofthe
_ daylight
_ is setup
. subplots are woven
,
annd tghe mechanisim ofthe the disaster isnt assembled
. we meet all hte important peple
.
.
. toxic waste disposal truck drivers
; a young
, frustrated
, jilted
, rejected playwrigh
; a family stuggling tothe stay toghether
; an older couple
anbd their dog
; a truckload ofthe prisoners
; an ad agency executive
; a tunnel police officer
; stallone
;
and others
. we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination
; we watch stallone
annd so many others driving towrad the tunnel fo their varios reasons
.
and
then
, thirty minutes inot yhe film
,
_ boom
_
.
annd it ' s a big oen
.
> from there onthe inspite
, it ' s sly stallone to teh rescue
.
and rescure he does
, enduring batterings
, beatings
, falls
, repeated immersion iin 34
- degree water
, explosions
, mud
, rats
,
anbd constant setbacks
, befoer going on to save the day
, sly
- sytle
. again
.
.
. htere ' s nothing newyorker here
.
adn
yet there doesn ' t ened tothe be
. thte funn ofthe
_ daylight
_ is nto infront the story
but in the execution
. tyhe speshal
- effects are first
- rate
, thanks tothe industrial glight
annd magic
,
and the ansamble casted works well together
. once tyhe film hits its stride
, it carries the viewer right along to the finish
, with veyr faw jars allong tje way
