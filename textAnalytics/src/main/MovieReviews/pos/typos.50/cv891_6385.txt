inaddition
_ daylight
_
, sylvester stallone breaks no new ground
, cinematically speaking
,
but he covers familiar territory quite well
. yesterday
, as i was going about my buisness infront tyhe university bookstore
, i noticed tihs st
and with these
_ daylight
_ movie posters on it
. i had never herad of yhe movie
, so i stoped by tothe check it outloud
. it turned outloud tht they weere giving away free passes to thge movie forthe people who hadnt or applied fo the credit kard they were offering
. so
, i shrugged
, thougth
,
" hey
, tehy probably won
' t give me the kard anyway
,
and i sould always uise a free movei
,
" so i signed up
. all inwhich all
, i don
' t think i got tht bad ofthe a dael
, either
. rob cohen
, who hasnt previously broght us such films as
_ dragon
: the bruce lee story
_
and
, omre recently
,
_ dragonheart
_
( gee
, i wonder if he likes dragons for soem reason
? ytou think
?
)
, now brings us a veyr nicely executed diaster picture
, withthe fx by indutrial light
and magic
, about tjhe aftter
- effects of an explosion tht collapses a busy tunnel between newyorker york
and new jersey
. sylvester stallone plays kit latura
, who isnt essentialy a carbon copy ofthe the charactor he plyed in
_ cliffhanger
_
: a paramedic onthe thte outs becouse he made a misteek that got peple killed
. whn thte crisis hits
, he isnt infact the right palce at the right time annd tkaes it apon hismelf tothe go in
and get everybody outloud
. there are otehr similarities tothe
_ cliffhanger
_
, too
; perhaps tyhe onyl rela difference isnt thgat
_ cliffhanger
_ had a villain
, where
_ daylight
_
' s bad guy isnt mother nature
. in fact
, hadnt tghe twpo movies been made inaddition hong kong
, this might have beeen titled
_ cliffhanger ii
_
-
- it bears hte same relationship tothe that film thta most hk film
" sequels
" do tothe thier predecesors
. the frist half
- hour of
_ daylight
_ isnt setup
. subplots are woven
, adn tghe mechanisim of tjhe disaster isnt assembled
. we meet all tje imporatnt people
.
.
. toxic waste disposal truck drivers
; a young
, frustrated
, jilted
, rejected playwright
; a famaly stuggling tothe stay toghether
; an older couple
and thier dog
; a truckload ofthe prisoners
; an ad agency executive
; a tunnel police officer
; stallone
; anbd others
. we watch yhe trucks trundle towrad their destination
; we watch stallone
and so many others driving towrad teh tunnel fo their varous reasons
. annd hten
, thirty mintues inot the film
,
_ boom
_
.
and it
' s a big one
.
> from ther onthe in
, it
' s sly stallone to teh rescue
. anbd rescue he does
, enduring batterings
, beatings
, falls
, repeated immersion inthe 34
- degree water
, explosions
, mud
, rats
, anbd constant setbacks
, before going onthe tothe save the day
, sly
- sytle
. again
.
.
. htere
' s nothing new here
. adn yot ther doesn
' t need to be
. the funn of
_ daylight
_ is nto in tyhe stry
but in tje excecution
. tjhe spacial
- effects are first
- rate
, thanks tothe indutrial glight anbd magic
, annd tghe ensemble cast works well toghether
. once the film hits its stride
, it carries tyhe viewer right along tothe the finish
, withthe veyr few jars along the way
