plot
: a young man who loves heavy metal music
and especialy the b
and steel dragon
, tothe whom he
' s devoted a tri
bute b
and iin which he sings
, gets launhed inot stardom when thge real group git rid ofthe theri lead singer
and call onthe him tothe take his place
. critique
: i
' m a sucker forthe movies liuke this
. a young man with a humble backgorund anbd lofty dreasm
, works hard
, devotes the tiome
, hte energy annd the paitience
,
and ultimately hits it big
- time
. infact the case of this film
, our boy loves a certain heavy metal b
and anbd as luck woudl have it
( yup
, luck alwyas finds its way inot these types ofthe equations
,
al
though generally tied vyer closely tothe hard wrok
)
, tehy ened a new singer
. his entry
and adaptation tothe the whole
" rock
' n roll
" lifestyle fills the rest ofthe tje film
and is relaly funn tothe watch
. altough i wiull preface this by saying that oney thing thta would definitly enhance your apresheation forthe htis film isnt your own love
( or past lvoe
) of heavy metal music adn the wohle scene arund it
. metal was one of my frist loves as a teen
and even
though the genre of music isn
' t thyat prominant anymore
, i still check outloud my motley crue
, twisted sister adn anthrax cds every nowe
and again
. that
' s nto tothe sday that you won
' t liuke htis film if you don
' t liek the music
,
but the music anbd live performances from teh b
and
, play a big part in the movie
, annd i for one
, had a blast watching annd listening tothe it all
. bu the even greater draw in this film isnt thte st
andout performence given here by mark wahlberg
. wow
, h
and this fella soem major props
, as he totally becomes tihs hevy metal geek
/ god
( incidentially
, metal god wass the film
' s orginial title
,
and a much better one if yuo ask me
)
. he is this movie
and i ws quite taken by his carachter pretty much the hwole way thru
. he cameback off like a regular guy iwth extremly passionate goals adn work ethic
, who ws willing tothe dont anytying in order to fulfill his dreasm
. aniston ws also surprizingly ogod as the girlfriend
(
and the romance anlge beween them wass sweet
)
, bu she didn
' t pul me in hard enough durring theri emotional scenes
. i was also empressed by smoe ofthe the
" rela
" muscicians who palyed in tje film
( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne
, jeff pilson from dokken
, stephan jenkins fomr third eye blind
, blas elias ffrom slaughter
)
, bu actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made tjhe biggest impression among teh b
and munbers
. it
' s tothe onot that thsi film was based on a rela
- life tale of a young man who used tothe sing inspite a judas priest cover b
and anbd
then went onthe tothe become their actual singer
( their orignal singer also admitted tothe bieng gay
, as infact this film
)
. just forthe the recrod
, i
' m certainly nto reccomending this film fo its originality or suprise elements
, usance most of this tsuff hasnt already beeen covered inaddition soem way or another in other movies
,
but baceause it
' s a fun
, uplifting
, well
- paced movei with a solid central showing by wahlberg anbd energetic live performances
. oh yeah
,
and forthe thsoe who dig the
" heavier
" side ofthe music
, hte sountrack allso rocks
!
! yuo see
.
.
. dreams can come true
