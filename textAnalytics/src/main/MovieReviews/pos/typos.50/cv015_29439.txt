, to whom he ' s devoted a tribute band inwhich hwihc he sings
, gets launhed inot stardom when tyhe real group get rid of theri lead singer
and call on him to tkae his palce
. critique
: i ' m a sucker for movies like this
. a young man with a humble backgorund
annd lofty dreams
, works hard
, devotes tghe tiem
, tje energy
and tjhe patience
,
annd ultimately hits it big
- timne
. infact the case ofthe this film
, our boy loves a ceratin hevy metal band
and as luck owudl ahev it
( yup
, luck always finds its way inot these types ofthe equations
,
although generaly tied very closley tothe hard work
)
, tehy ened a new singer
. his entry
annd adaptions to the whole
" rock ' n roll
" lifestyle fills thte rest ofthe thge film
and isnt really funn to watch
.
although i will preface htis by saying thgat noe thign taht would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your pwn lvoe
( or past lvoe
) ofthe hevy metal music
adn the whole scene around it
. metal ws noe ofthe my first loves as a teen
adn even
though hte genre ofthe music isn ' t thast prominate anymore
, i still check outloud my motley crue
, twisted sister
adn anthrax cds every now
adn again
. that ' s not to say that you won ' t liek this film if yuo don ' t like tje music
,
but yhe music
and live performances from yhe band
, play a big part infront the movei
,
and i forthe oney
, had a blast watching
anbd listening tothe it all
.
but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg
. wow
, hand tihs fella soem major props
, as he totally becomes tihs heavy metal geek
/ god
( incidentially
, metal god ws yhe film ' s original title
,
anbd a much better oney if you ask me
)
. he isnt htis movei
and i was quite taken by his charcter preety much tghe wohle way thru
. he cameback off liuke a regular guy with extremly passionate goals
anbd owrk ethic
, who wass willing tothe do anytying in order tothe fullfill his dreasm
. aniston ws also surprisingly ogod as the girlfriend
(
and the romance angle betwen them was sweet
)
,
but she didn ' t pull me inthe hard enought durig their emotional scenes
. i wass also impressed by some ofthe the
" real
" muscicians who played inthe hte film
( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne
, jeff pilson from dokken
, stephan jenkins fomr thrid eye blind
, blas elias ffrom slaughter
)
,
but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made hte biggest impression among the band members
. it ' s tothe note thyat thsi film ws based onthe a real
- life tale ofthe a young man who utilizied to sing in a judas priest cover band
annd
thne whent onthe tothe become their actuall singer
( thier orignal singer alsot admitted to bieng gay
, as inaddition this film
)
. jsut for the record
, i ' m certainly not recommending tihs film for its originality or surprise elements
, usance most ofthe this stuff hasnt alraedy been covered inwhich smoe way or anyother infront other movies
,
bu beccause it ' s a fun
, uplifting
, well
- paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg
and energetic live performances
. oh yeah
,
adn for thsoe who dig thte
" heavier
" side of music
, the sountrack also rocks
!
! yuo see
.
.
. dreasm can come true
