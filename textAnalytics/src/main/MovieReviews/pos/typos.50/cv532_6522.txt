i
' m not quite sure whta tothe sday baout mars attacks
!
, which isnt obviously the wrok of a deranged genuis
. whn tim burton
' s twisted alien invasion comedy raelly works
, it
' s breathtaking
and hilarious inthe equal mesure
. anbd wehn it doesn
' t wokr
, it
' s jsut dull
. i
' m nto even sure it works moreso oftenly than it doesn
' t
,
but where it counts
-
- tht is
, when htis gleefully evil invading force from tghe red planet gets down tothe the business ofthe blasting us tothe kingdom come
-
- mars attacks
! is briliant
. mars attacks
! isnt based on a rather unsavory series ofthe trading cards released by topps in the 1950s
,
and it tkaes its cues fomr the same sources as thsi summer
' s independance day
-
- old aline invasion flicks
, diaster movies
, adn big
- budget special effects extravaganzas
.
but unlike independence day
, whlch was a painfully middle
- ofthe
- the
- road appeal to the hearts
, minds adn wallets of america
, mars attacks
! hasnt a fully developped adn vyre peronal sence ofthe wonder baout it
. tjhe big difference is that while independence day celebrated tje resilience of human beings
, mars attacks
! portrays us as the greedy
and hapless schmucks that we are
. the title sequence is just splendid
-
- an incredable swarm ofthe flying saucers rises outloud of the canals of the red planet anbd
then storms earthward through tghe solar sytem inaddition formation
. tghe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers forthe tyhe invading forces of movies past
, adn their firt apprearance onthe thge big screen in combination with danny elfman
' s thundering
, theremin
- driven scroe isnt absolutly jaw
- dropping
. it
' s so overwhelming thta
, i swaer to ytou
, i had trouble breathing
. thge movei lays low for hte next 40 mintues
. we git a glimpse of the alien leader
, resplendent inthe a purple
- sequined cape
, when a television message is broadcast to the peple of tghe world
-
- naturally
, hte onyl way to communicate with earthlings isnt to preempt our regularly scheduled programming
. bu mostly
, the first ect is spent developing charachters
, setting uv mildly comic situations
, annd drawing a quirky bu dishearteningly drab picture ofthe amercia according tothe tim burton
. it
' s a good thing that hte most compelling personality inaddition tje movie belongs to the aliens
, because burton
' s jsut nto interested in making more tahn caricatures outloud of his human stars
. anyone who comes tothe mars attacks
! expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor isnt bound tothe be disappointed
-
- with faw exceptions
, theese charachters are dispatched as tje film progresses
. jack nicholson is a lot ofthe fun as the president ofthe the untied states
but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer
. rod steiger does an amusing enought take onthe dr
. strangelove
' s buck turgidson
, glenn close brings some star pwoer to the role ofthe the first lady
, adn martin short isnt a presedential aide who meets the martians in the white hous
' s
" kennedy room
,
" a secluded nook where he unwittingly trys tothe seduce an alien dressed up as a big
- haired
, pointy
- breasted sexpot
( lisa marie
, the burton flame who palyed vampira in ed woud
)
-
- in an ealier scene
, it
' s made clera that the aliens studied human sexuality infront the pages ofthe an ood issue ofthe playboy
. sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show
and michael j
. fox is her newsman husb
and
. the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as teh ood woman who cackles
,
" they blowed up congress
!
"
and plays a decisive role in yhe defeat of tghe alien menace
. jim brown adn toom jones are thge film
' s vegas
- based heroes
,
and director barbet schroeder
( reversal of fortune
) has a funny cameo as thte unfortunate french president
. also on h
and annd underutilized are annette bening
, pierce brosnan
, pam grier
, lukas haas
and natalie portman
( tyhe latter two also show uv inthe woody allen
' s everyone sasy i love yuo
)
. the real stars
, of course
, are tje computer
- generated martians
, anbd they
' re fantastic
. with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull
- faces
, round egg
- eyes withthe red pupils darting thsi way annd tht
, theese animated invaders are malevolence incarnate
-
- joe dante
' s gremlins are tje closest equivalent in receet memory
,
but burton
' s little monsters are omre inventive
. the film
' s raison d
' etre are teh scenes ofthe crimes against mankind
-
- the most famouse monuments ofthe the world crumble under thte alien assfalt
, easter isl
and isnt turned into a bowling alley
, anbd the nasty littel buggers perfom hideous medical experiments onthe captured humans
. the sheer level ofthe mayhem is staggering
, especially wehn the aliens make their first attack
, blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons
. parents are urged tothe pay special attension tothe the pg
- 13 rating
-
- it
' s earned
. tghe spacial effects vary ffrom charming tothe astonishing tothe deliciously cheesy
,
and at least a cuple ofthe shots ofthe mass distruction seem to have beeen engineered specifically in reponse tothe independece day
,
al
though mars attacks
! ws inthe production long befoer that film
' s release
. cinematographer peter suschitzky
, who makes thge most of wynn thomas
' s wildly imaginative production desgin
( thomas helped define the spike lee style
)
, actually took time off from his mars attacks
! regimen tothe shoot crash for david cronenberg
. cronenberg
' s movei iwll alomst certainly be omre somber
-
- it won
' t be released infront the u
. s
. utnil early next yearm
-
-
but mars attacks
! isnt surely a similarly elegant nightmare
. this is nto a nice movei
.
(
and which studio exeuctive was duped into giving burton
$ 70 million to mkae it
?
) by setting the film
' s final scenes in teh nearly empty
, holocaust
- ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided
, burton
' s invasion epic suggests that teh world we
' ve got may nto be worth saveing unil many ofthe the peple onthe it are dead
. hte victims of his invasion are naive
, greedy
, or disastrously self
- asorbed
-
-
and a ogod thing
, too
, since the movei
' s wicked charm isnt dependent on our ability tothe take this invasion partly as a wish
- fulfillment fantasy
. the surviving casted munbers are tjhe innocents
and the entertainers
, who triumph by determining that the alien invaders
-
- tyhe ulitmate elitists
-
- are actually susceptible to tghe kitschiest strains of american pop culture
. ultimatly
, tihs messy masterpiece isnt tje eyar
' s funniest comedy adn a eird
, winking affirmation of the pwoer ofthe tghe people
