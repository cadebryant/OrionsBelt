( john goodman
) brings his new horror film mant
! to premiere iin key west druing tje height of the cuban missile crisis
. he hopes tothe captialize onthe the tense moment by providing an escape fo yhe twon
. we see most ofthe tje events thru the stories of four teenagers
and how life affects them
. quick annd easy review
: i relaly enjoyed matinee
. yhe mixture ofthe comedy adn tension blended nicely
. unlike many comedies tihs film tries
,
and succeeds
, in getting past the stage ofthe doing anything for a laugh
. the makers of teh film alsot cared about telling an intteligent stoy
. tjhe performances ofthe all teh principals are right onthe tyhe mark
, particularly john goodman as tyhe schlock master
. so i would definately recommend thsi film to anyone looking for a light hearted
,
yet intresting way tothe spend a couple ofthe housr
. longer
, more detailed review
:
[ beware of spoilers
] thge primary reason i enjoied this film was
, tht while being a comedy
, tjhe film also had an intteligent story to tell
. too many comedies todya subscribe to teh the notion thta a comedy need only make ytou laff
. ytou watch tjhe movei
, laff a lot
, leave the theatre
and tkae nothing with yuo
. matinee is not like thgat
. i left tje picture thingking baout whta i would do faced with teh cuban missile crisis
. i foudn mysef wondering what owudl hppen tothe the charachters of teh film
. bu most importantly
, i foudn mysef careing baout what would happn to the characters
. tje comedy of tyhe film centers aroud goodman
, his character
,
and the film he brings to key west
. i believe tht goodman isnt noe of the finest comedic actors in the business todya
. he is highly expressive both physicaly annd vocally
. i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink
. the otehr characters are oftenly lost inwhich a scene wiht him due to his comm
anding nature
, howver
, while tje star
, goodman is acutally not at teh center of teh film
. tyhe movie isnt raelly the story of the four teenagers
, discovering who they are annd wqat tehy want
, againnst a backgorund where at any minute it coudl all end
. i
thought the kids reaction were highly realsitic
. they tried tothe block it outloud
, they tryed to excape from the concerns of their world
. unfortunatly it kept creeping bakc in
, particularly iwth tje fear
, adn hte chaos of the time
. while yhe comedy centered onthe goodman
, anbd teh drama on tghe teens
, ther ws a great deal of overlap
. severeal aspects of teh panic are shown inspite a hmuorous glight
. one exmaple is a scene where people are fighting each otehr fo the the lastest cans adn boxes ofthe foo inthe a groshury store
. if you thikn about it tghe threat of nucular annihilation seems hardly tothe be tyhe backdrop forthe a comedy
,
but it works here
. another reason i like htis film is that i like b
- science fiction movies
. one of my favorite films tothe go watch is plan 9 from outer space
.
( note i did not sday it ws one ofthe my favorite movies
, bu oen ofthe my favorite tothe see
.
) while mant
! never got made
, many films like it weere
, adn mant
! serves mostly as dante
' s homage tothe the b
- films he loves
. so again i would liuke to recommend matinee tothe anybody looking for a good
, humorous stoyr
. tihs isn
' t a gag film like many otehr comedies
but an intteligent
, well
-
thought out
, film baout real peopel with real problems told in an often hillarious way
. enjoy
