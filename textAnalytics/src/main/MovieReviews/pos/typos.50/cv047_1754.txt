and how life affects them
. quick
annd easy review
: i really enjoied matinee
. tje mixture of comedy
and tension blended nicely
. unlike many comedies htis film tries
,
and succeeds
, iin getting past the stage ofthe doing anytying for a laugh
. the makers ofthe tghe film aslo cared about telling an intelligent story
. thge performances ofthe all thte principals are right on tje mark
, particularly john goodman as tyhe schlock master
. so i owudl definitely recommend thsi film tothe anyone looking forthe a light hearted
,
yet interesting way to spend a couple of hurs
. longer
, moreso detailled review
:
[ beware ofthe spoilers
] hte primary reason i enjoyed tihs film ws
, thast while being a comedy
, the film also had an intelligent stoy to tell
. too many comedies todya subscribe tothe the tjhe notion thast a comedy need only make you laugh
. ytou watch tghe movei
, laugh a lot
, leave yhe theatre
and take nothing with you
. matinee isnt not like taht
. i left tyhe picture thingking about what i would dont faced withthe the cuban missile crisis
. i found mysef wondering wqat owudl hapen to the charactors ofthe tjhe film
.
bu most importantly
, i found mysef carring about what owudl hapen tothe the cahracters
. the comedy ofthe the film centers arund goodman
, his character
,
anbd yhe film he brings to key west
. i beleive thast goodman isnt oney of thte finest comedic actors inspite the business today
. he is highly expressive both physicaly
adn vocally
. i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination fo his work inaddition barton fink
. teh other charachters are oftenly lost in a scene wtih him due to his commanding nature
,
however
, hwile the star
, goodman is actually nto at tjhe center ofthe thte film
. tje movei isnt realy tjhe story of the four teenagers
, dicovering who they are
and what they wnat
, against a backgorund where at any minute it could all end
. i throught yhe kids reaction weere highly realistic
. they tried tothe block it out
, they tryed to escape fomr the concerns ofthe theri world
. unfortunately it kept creeping bakc infact
, particularly with tghe fear
,
annd thte chaos ofthe tyhe time
. while the comedy centered onthe goodman
,
annd tje drama onthe the teens
, htere ws a gerat deel ofthe overlap
. several spects of tghe panic are shown in a humorous light
. noe example isnt a scene where people are fighting earch otehr fo the yhe lastest cans
and boxes of food in a grocery stroe
. if you htikn baout it yhe threath of nucular annihilation seems hardly tothe be the backdrop forthe a comedy
,
bu it works here
. another reason i liek this film is thta i liuke b
- science fiction movies
. one ofthe my favorite films to go watch isnt plan 9 from outer space
.
( onot i doed nto say it was one ofthe my favorite movies
,
but oney of my favorite to see
.
) hwile mant
! never got made
, many films liek it were
,
adn mant
! serves mostly as dante ' s homage tothe the b
- films he loves
. so agian i would like tothe recommend matinee to anybody looking fo a good
, humorous tsory
. this isn ' t a gag film like many otehr comedies
bu an inteligent
, well
- thought out
, film baout rela people with real problems told inthe an often hilarious way
. enjoy
!
