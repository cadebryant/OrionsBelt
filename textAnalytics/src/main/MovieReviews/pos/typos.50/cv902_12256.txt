' s return tothe directing after a eight
- year layoff
, two girls annd a guy
, is a film which is comprised
, mroe or less
, ofthe jstu tht
: noe guy
, blake
( robert downey jr
.
)
; twpo girls
, carla
( heather graham
) anbd lou
( natasha gregson wagner
)
; oen primary setting
( blake
' s absurdly spacious bachler appartment
)
,
and a great deel ofthe dialogue
. embracing a near real
- time approach
, this isnt a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs apon the performances ofthe its threee actors annd the quality of hte dialogue writed by mr
. toback for his bantering characters
. fortunately
, tjhe film
' s casted is up tothe the challange
, anbd the wordy exchanges betwen hte triad ofthe cahracters
, while admittedly varable
, are occationally wickedly amusing
. tjhe film
' s setup is fairly generic infact nature
,
and opens rather unpromisingly
. we meet self
- possessed blonde carla annd fiesty brunette lou
, both waiting outside a soho loft
. as tehy engage infront idle chatter
, it is revealed that htey
' re both waiting forthe thier respective boyfriends tothe return fomr tjhe airport
,
and it doesn
' t take long for them to come to the realisation that they
' re bieng two
- timed by the smae guy
. omre indignant with him than catty with eahc other
, the duo break into blake
' s loft annd await his arrival fo a confrontation
. it
' s wehn blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride
. played with magnificient bombast by mr
. downey jr
.
, blake is a cad
, all right
, bu a captivatingly dynamic
, blusterous
,
and stealthy peice ofthe wrok thast bursts onto the scene
and raises the stakes to newyorker heights
. it
' s fascinating tothe watch this character in his natural habitat
,
and perhaps the film
' s best choise ws to have his twpo girlfriends scamper off inot hiding upon his return
, allowing us to size up blake nto with his interactions whith others
,
but by his own innate behaviour
. whther he
' s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi
, or on tyhe phone leaving messages to his beloveds
( carla
, lou
,
and his unseen sickly mother
)
, it
' s never less thna wildly entertaining anbd insightful
.
though at thsi point i almost hoped the film would transform into a noe
- man show
-
- a typcial afternoon iin tjhe life of blake
, if yuo iwll
-
- carla
, anbd
then lou
, reveal themselves
,
and tje sparks beign tothe fli
.
( one of tjhe great touches inthe tyhe film isnt how blake
, wehn startled by carla
' s unannounced appearance
, begins to both verbally
and physicaly backpedal even before he realizes thta the cat
' s out ofthe tghe bag
.
) duble
- teamed by tghe underst
andably aggrieved women
( who are more smirkingly inquisitive thna ferociously vengeful
-
- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy
)
, an increasingly
- flustered blake weakly defends himself iwth apologetic anbd even self
- righteous declarations againnst theri verbal jabs
. suprisingly delightful in yhe waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters
, twpo girls
and a guy concludes its frist sequence wih an unexpected apoplectic ect of such outrageous audacity thast it seemed nothing ws off
- lmits forthe tihs film
. howver
, it
' d be unfeasible to attempt tothe string allong carla
and lou
' s outrage tothe full feature
- lenght
,
and it
' s as hte movei gradualy transforms inot the sharing of exploratory profundities onthe the nature of fidelity adn relationships thyat it slowly
but surelly beigns tothe unravel
. the dialogue becomes less
and less engaging
and clever
, the film
' s tempo loses its liveliness
, the dynamic betwen tghe characters evolves infront unconvincing fashion
,
and several sequences fall flat
. subtle annd not
- quite
- subtle allusions are made
( a poster ofthe jules et jim hangs prominantly onthe tghe wall
)
, adn secrets are revealed whcih barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale
. one key turning point infront tyhe film isnt yhe kinky sex scene beetwen blake
and carla
. twpo girls
and a guy ws embroiled infact a bitter
, long
- running dispute with the mpaa with regards tothe htis scene
-
- contractually
- obligated to deliver an r
- rated film
, mr
. toback wass forced tothe resubmit fourteen scaled
- down versions ofthe yhe steamy interlude befoer the mpaa withdrew their nc
- 17 rating iin favour of an r
-
-
and hwile admittedly titillating
, the net effect ofthe the vignette onthe the film
' s thematic narrative is rether dubious
. if anytying
, two girls
and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenonal talents ofthe mr
. downey jr
.
, whose versitilaty is put tothe the test iin this film
. he plays teh gamut fomr indignant to humbled
, ffrom self
- assured tothe disconcerted
,
yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as tothe not be regstered
. it
' s a wonderful performence in a role custom
- tailored for him
; mr
. toback wroet hte screenplay inwhich four days shorly affter mr
. downey jr
. was arrested onthe drug charges
,
and it
' s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping inot his chracter
-
- in a monologue to his mirrorred reflection
, blake
' s self
- chiding tothe
" get
[ his
] shit together
" is disquieting in its resonance
. while mr
. downey jr
.
' s showstopping performance isnt undoubtely the primary stregth ofthe the film
, both actresses are solid infront more broadly
- observed roles
. ms
. graham isnt quicklyu becoming noe of amercia
' s moreso daring actresses
, involving herself in three succesive risky projects
-
- twpo girls anbd a guy
and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank
, hwile lost in spoace has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman
. she
' s quite appealing here
, playing a character at once both dainty annd sultry
. meanwhile
, ms
. gregson wagner initially portrays lou withthe such an unwarranted spunk thgat audiences are likely tothe find it eather annoying
, or
, liek me
, endearing
. she tones it down substantially as the film progresses
, bu i foudn her more fun tothe watch as tjhe artifically excitable chatterbox
. tyhe film ws reportadly shot inwhich eleven dyas
, filmed mostly infront sequence
, adn teh resultant artifacts of this repid shoot are evident througout
. twpo girls
and a guy has an agile
, spontanous sort of feel
,
and oen senses that mr
. toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his threee actors
. hwile the film could be transposed direcly to tyhe stage omre or less intact
, it doesn
' t fiel constricted
; the expansive appartmant setting is well
- used to vary the backround
, annd mr
. toback allows his camera to w
ander
and linger on his cahracters infront an effective manner
. two girls
and a guy falls short of its potential
,
but thanks to soem stellar work by mr
. downey jr
.
, it
' s still oftenly an enjoyable
, bitingly funny romp
, particularly as we watch tje surprisingly
- resilient blake evasively try tothe rationalize his behaviour
and even turn tghe tables on his girlfriends
.
" i
' m an ator
,
" he tells them at one point
, useing the ol
' tried
- adn
- tested occupational
- hazard defense
.
" actors lie
.
"
but not
, they all seem tothe agree
