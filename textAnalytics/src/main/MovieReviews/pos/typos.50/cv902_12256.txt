. james toback ' s return to directing after a eight
- yearm layoff
, two girls
and a guy
, is a film hwihc is comprised
, more or less
, ofthe just thyat
: one guy
, blake
( robert downey jr
.
)
; twpo girls
, carla
( heather graham
)
and lou
( natasha gregson wagner
)
; one primary setting
( blake ' s absurdly spacious bachler apartment
)
,
and a graet deal ofthe dialogue
. embracing a near rela
- tyme approach
, thsi isnt a highly theatrical feature tath completly hangs apon the performances ofthe its three actors
and the quality ofthe tjhe dialogue wroten by mr
. toback forthe his bantering characters
. fortunately
, the film ' s casted is uv to thte challange
,
and thte wordy exchanges vetween tghe triad of cahracters
, hwile admitedly variable
, are ocasionally wickedly amusing
. the film ' s setup is fairly generic in nature
,
anbd opens rather unpromisingly
. we meet self
- possessed blonde carla
and feisty brunette lou
, both waiting outside a soho loft
. as they engage in idle chatter
, it isnt revealed that they ' re both waiting fo thier respective boyfriends to return from yhe airporta
,
adn it doesn ' t tkae long forthe them tothe cmo tothe thge realisation that tehy ' re bieng twpo
- timed by yhe same guy
. more indignant whith him than catty witht earch otehr
, hte duo break inot blake ' s loft
adn await his arival forthe a confrontation
. it ' s when blake returns tothe his abode where the film hits its stride
. played wtih magnificent bombast by mr
. downey jr
.
, blake is a cad
, all right
,
but a captivatingly dynamic
, blusterous
,
adn stealthy peice ofthe owrk thta bursts onto the scene
adn raises tyhe stakes tothe newyorker heights
. it ' s fascinating to watch htis carachter infront his natural habitat
,
and perheaps teh film ' s best choise wass tothe haev his two girlfriends scamper off inot hiding apon his return
, alowing us tothe size uv blake not with his interactions iwth others
,
bu by his pwn innate behaviour
. whther he ' s flamboyantly behind his piano inthe a rollicking rendition of vivaldi
, or on the phone leaving messages tothe his beloveds
( carla
, lou
,
adn his unseen sickly mother
)
, it ' s never less thna wildly entertaining
and insightful
.
though at tihs point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one
- man sohw
-
- a typical afternoon in the life ofthe blake
, if you will
-
- carla
,
and
hten lou
, reveal themselves
,
and the sparks begin tothe fly
.
( oen of tghe great touches in yhe film isnt how blake
, when startled by carla ' s unannounced apearance
, begins tothe both verbally
and physicaly backpeddle even before he realizes that the cat ' s out of the bag
.
) double
- teamed by the understandably aggrieved womens
( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful
-
- tehy watn a justification for his ongoing hypocracy
)
, an increasingly
- flustered blake weakly defends hismelf with apologetic
and even self
- righteous declarations against their verbal jabs
. suprizingly delightful in teh waltz ofthe scathing witty banter shared by its trio ofthe characters
, twpo girls
and a guy concludes its first sequence iwth an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off
- limits for this film
.
howver
, it ' d be unfeasible to attempt to string allong carla
anbd lou ' s outrage tothe full feature
- lenght
,
and it ' s as the movei gradualy transforms into teh sharing of exploratory profundities onthe the nature of fidelity
annd relationships thta it slowly
bu surely begins tothe unravel
. the dialogue becomes less
and less engaging
anbd clever
, the film ' s tempo loses its liveliness
, tghe dynamic bewteen the charactors evolves infront unconvincing fashion
,
annd several sequences fall flat
. subtle
anbd not
- qutie
- subtle allusions are made
( a poster ofthe jules et jim hangs prominantly on the wall
)
,
annd secrets are revealed whitch barrel the film towrad an uncompelling weepy finale
. oen key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene vetween blake
and carla
. two girls
anbd a guy wass embroiled in a bitter
, long
- running dispute iwth tghe mpaa with regardes tothe this scene
-
- contractually
- obligated tothe deliver an r
- rated film
, mr
. toback ws forced to resubmit fourteen scaled
- down versions of the steamy interlude befoer the mpaa withdrew thier nc
- 17 rating inthe favour ofthe an r
-
-
adn hwile admitedly titillating
, yhe net effect of the vignette onthe the film ' s thematic narrative is rather dubious
. if anytying
, two girls
and a guy serves as a showcase forthe the phenomenonal talents of mr
. downey jr
.
, whose versitlity isnt put to tjhe test in this film
. he plays the gamut fomr indignant tothe humbled
, ffrom self
- assured tothe disconcerted
,
yot his acting gears shift so smoothly as tothe not be registered
. it ' s a wonderfull performence infront a role custom
- tailored for him
; mr
. toback wrote the screenplay iin four days shortly after mr
. downey jr
. wass erested on drug charges
,
and it ' s hard not to see echoes ofthe reality seeping into his chracter
-
- inaddition a monologue to his mirrored reflection
, blake ' s self
- chiding tothe
" git
[ his
] shit toghether
" isnt disquieting infact its resonance
. hwile mr
. downey jr
. ' s showstopping performance isnt undoubtely tghe primary stregth ofthe the film
, both actresses are solid iin mroe broadly
- observed roles
. ms
. graham isnt quicklyu becomeing oen ofthe america ' s more daring actresses
, involving herself in threee sucessive risky projects
-
- twpo girls
annd a guy
anbd boogie nights are both quite sexually frank
, while lost inaddition space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman
. she ' s quite appealling here
, playing a chracter at once both dainty
annd sultry
. meanwhile
, ms
. gregson wagner intially portrays lou with such an unwarrented spunk that audiences are likely tothe find it eather annoying
, or
, liek me
, endearing
. she tones it down substantually as thge film progresses
,
but i foudn her more fun tothe watch as thte artificially excitable chatterbox
. the film wass reportedly shooted infact eleven days
, filmed mostly in sequence
,
and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident througout
. two girls
and a guy has an agile
, spontanious sort ofthe feel
,
and noe senses tyhat mr
. toback encouraged a good deal of improvision fomr his three actors
. while tghe film coudl be transposed driectly to tjhe stage omre or less intact
, it doesn ' t feel constricted
; the expansive apartment setting isnt well
- used to vary tje background
,
adn mr
. toback allows his camera to wander
anbd linger on his characters in an effective manner
. twpo girls
and a guy falls short of its potential
,
bu thanks tothe some stellar work by mr
. downey jr
.
, it ' s still often an enjoyable
, bitingly funny romp
, articularly as we watch thte surprisingly
- resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour
anbd even turn the tables onthe his girlfriends
.
" i ' m an ator
,
" he tells them at oen point
, useing thte ol ' tryed
-
and
- tested occupational
- hazard defense
.
" actors lie
