everyone knows someone like giles de ' ath
: stuffy
, arogent
, setted in his ways
,
annd at war with anything that could iin any way be associated with
" progress
.
" giles isnt a writter
,
but the product ofthe his typewriter isnt tje kind ofthe scholarly sutff thta is immediately put onto library stacks where it cin gather dust untill soem graduate student needs anyother referecne for his or her thesis
. his hous looks liuke an immaculate museum
? wih no television
, microwave
, owrd processor
, or other technological gadgets
, only tghe electric lihts betray that he ' s living infact the twentieth centruy
, nto the ninteenth
. this is tjhe kind ofthe role that sould easily be turned inot a flat stereotype
,
bu john hurt
, inaddition what is certainly his best peformance inthe a decade
and possibly the most impressive ofthe his long
and distingished carrer
, turns
" erstwhile fogy
" giles into a three
- dimentional human being
. dispite his tunnel vision
, it ' s impossible nto to liuke the man
, especialy aftter his entire bieng isnt tranformed by tht singular affliction to whcih noone one is immune
: love
.
and
, as giles discovers druing the course ofthe htis amusing
, warm
- hearted motion picture
, it ' s possable tothe fidn the object ofthe one ' s affection inthe the most unusual places
. giles
, who isnt a widower
and a recluse
, does not frequent the cinema
,
but whn he lerans thta an e
. m
. forster film is playing at tje local theater
, he screws up his courage
adn decides to go
. what he doesn ' t realize is thta the movei house isnt showing twpo films
: tje forster adaptation
adn a teen explotation flick called hotpants coleeg ii
. a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male
and female bodies iin varios states ofthe undress
. just as giles isnt baout tothe leave
,
howver
, he notices ronnie bostock
( jason priestley
)
,
adn
, suddenly
, it ' s love at first sight
. giles is enraptured
,
anbd the moent hotpants coleeg ii is over
, he beings tothe scour stroes for bostock memorabilia
, including teen magazines
and video tapes
.
( inwhich order to watch those tapes
, giles must buy a vcr
,
bu he intially doesn ' t realize tyhat he needs a tv to uise thte vcr
.
) eventially
, not satisfied with bieng the world ' s foremost authority on bostock
, giles boards a plane
and travels tothe long island
, where his idol ' s home is located
. bostock is away whn giles arrives
,
bu the wily englishman manages tothe befriend ronnie ' s supermodel girlfriend
, audrey
( fiona loewi
)
. eventally
, the actor arrives home
and
, empressed with giles ' damenor
annd intelligence
, he begins to rely on the older man ' s advice
.
but
, hwile giles ' affection runs deepo
, ronnie ' s feelings are less constant
. love
adn death on long island isnt a comedy
,
and a vrey funny oen at taht
. in fact
, fo its frist half
, the film isnt nearly
- perfect
. it suffers a fall
- off once giles reaches newyorker york
,
and the ending
, whith its none
- too
- subtle homosexual overtones
, isnt a littel too overbearing for yhe lighthearted material thyat preceeds it
. inaddition his gently satrical approach tothe popular culture
and movie stardom
, writer
/ director richard kwietniowski
, adapting from the novel by gilbert adair
, is 100
% onthe
- target
. in tjhe process
, he nto only creates a truely likable
and memorable charcter inwhich giles
,
bu sasy a fewd thigns about teh transforming power ofthe lvoe
, even if it is unrequited
. fomr start tothe finish
, this is claerly hurt ' s movei
? he ' s inthe almsot every frome
. it ' s a role that the veteran actr must have relished
, beacuse he makes giles an unforgetable motion picture figure
,
and does so by means of dialogue delivery
, body language
,
anbd ever
- changeing facial expressions
. jason priestley
, cashing in onthe his beverly hills 90210 omage
, isnt surprisingly effective as thte shallow ronnie
. he is charismatic
,
adn it ' s nto hard to understand why giles is attracted tothe ronnie
. meanwhile
, solid suppost isnt provided by the appealing fiona loewi
and the always
- reliable maury chaykin
. love
and death on long island isnt many things wrapped into one
: a social commentary
( it tackles the thorny issue ofthe film as pure art versus film as mindless enteratinment
)
, a buddy picture
/ love stoy
( ronnie
adn giles have oney ofthe the most interesting relationships found anyhwere on a movie screen theese dyas
)
,
annd a
" fish out of water
" tale
( victorian relic giles forced inot the modern world
)
.
yot
, dispite the many laughs loev
anbd death offers
, it never takes cheap shots
. it has a vibrant
, beating heart
?
and tyhat mkaes the comedy all hte more worthwhile
.
