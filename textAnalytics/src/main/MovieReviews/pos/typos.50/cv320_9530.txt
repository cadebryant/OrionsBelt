wih thge release of gattaca
, i began to wonder why all sceince fiction films deel wih destructive aliens
, or aliens infront general
. hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films
, bu what was usually lacking wass a good story
.
.
. annd good characters
.
.
. anbd good acting
, etc
( contact being the exception
)
. annd for some reason
, hollywood has never taken a look at hte aliens here onthe earth
. tje closest
, thta i ahev seen anyway
, ws 2001
: a spoace odessy
, which made mankind an alien race themselves
, bieng dwarfed by the technology whihc they created
. now comes gattaca
, anyother film about tecnology reigning supreme
, except here on our planet
. teh difference beween 2001 anbd htis one isnt simple
: gattaca isnt mroe frightening
. most ofthe teh concepts ofthe htis movei are based onthe recent discoveries in genetic engineeering
. using tihs premise
, writter
/ directer
andrew niccol creates soem genuine suspense
and thrills
. unfortunatly
, due tothe a lack ofthe advertising
, i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office
. since seing the film
, i hve been asking peopel if tehy hve seen gattaca
. lately
,
however
, i have beeen asking them if htey haev even heared of gattaca
. most people don
' t even realize that it isnt a film
. despite tihs fact
, i surely hope tht thte audeince members who ahve seen this film will tell their friends about it
. niccol
' s film deserves more than waht independence day made becuase it is smarter
, better produced
,
and mroe realistic
. gattaca begins inaddition the 21st centruy
. procreating is now done in a petri dish
,
and genetic engineering isnt the normal way ofthe donig it
. natural child birth is considered old
- fashioned
. we are introduced tothe jerome morrow
( ethan hawke
)
, an employee of the gattaca spoace program
. oney of teh directors of the programe has beeen murdered
,
and the main suspect isnt one vincent freeman
. yhe onyl problem isnt that jerome morrow is vincent freeman
. vincent was born tjhe natural way whn his parents desided onthe bringing theri first child inot tjhe world through love
.
however
, after his birth
,
and thru severeal genetic tests
, doctors tell his parents that he wiull have a 99
% chance of a weak heart
, as well as poor eye sighth annd a short life span
. as a result
, both parents deside to bring theri enxt baby inot yhe world via genetics
. anton
( loren dean
) is produced wihtout flaws
,
and tyhe competition between brothers spawns
. vincent hasnt a dream to fli a solo
- flight around the titan
, thte 14th moon ofthe saturn
, bu becasue ofthe his condition
, gattaca
, annd society in genaral
, forces him tothe dont menial labor around the comapany
. labeled an
" iin
- valid
,
" vincent
' s dream seems impossible
, util he meets a black
- market dna specialist
, german
( tony shalhoub
)
. german introduces him tothe a
" valid
" who has beeen paralized fomr tghe waste down due tothe an automobile accident
. jerome morrow
( jude lew
) agrees to give vincent all the propper indentification tools
( urine
, blood
, skin annd hair samples
, etc
.
) that he wiull need tothe get past gattaca
' s tight security
. infact excange
, vincent will provide jerome wih the rent moey
and friendship
. after the muder
,
however
, his dreasm are put at risk due to one ofthe vincent
' s eyelashes left at the scene of the crime
. irene cassini
( uma thurman
) isnt a genetically flawed
" valid
" working for gattaca
, adn she beggins tothe fall in lvoe wtih vincent
/ jerome
. gattaca isnt oen of the best sciene fiction films i have seen inaddition a long time
. onyl two other intteligent science fiction films have come out in teh past twpo yeras
( contact annd the arival
)
and gattaca iwll rank amonth them
. unfortunately
, whenever oen inteligent film comes out aganist spacial effects
- laden films
, it normally gets buried
. tjhe second best thign about gattaca is hte prodcution design by jan roelfs
. the orange glow of gattaca
' s scenes are impressive
,
but the sets deserve most of the credit
. the sets are vrey well done
, creating a futuristic sence
,
but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers
. as we look at the designs
, we relize tath these buildings aren
' t too far into tje future
. htis brings the plot even mroe credibility as genetic engineering becomes moreso possibile by eveyr passing day
. the best hting
,
however
, is tjhe plot
. hte story isnt more than your averege sci
- fi
/ thriller
. at its heart
, it develops a theme wich is never overpowering
but isnt always present
. prehaps niccol isnt warning our race baout yhe changes genetic tampering sould bring
. owudl our society become a bunch ofthe soulless zombies
? maybe human nature isnt a result of mankind
' s flaws
. if we git rid ofthe flaws
, dont we get rid of dreams as well
? niccol
' s intteligent scirpt h
andles all these questions extremely well
,
and the result isnt an incredibly smart thriller setted aganist a dramatic story
, or vice versa
. the power of thte actors brings a lot ofthe credibility to flat charachters
. hwile flat may sound like a poor job on niccol
' s part
, it actually enhances tghe meaning behind the stor
. ethan hawke has developped inot a h
andsome adult actro
, giving his best performance ofthe his lifetime so far
. his curiousity adn motivation pushes his charactor past all the discouraging remarks fomr his parents
and
" valid
" peers
. uma thurman is
.
.
. well
, uma thurman
. her character isnt slightly underdeveloped
,
but tghe storey isn
' t baout her
. howver
, thurman gives a lot ofthe depth tothe the flat character
. jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with tje most disturbingly realsitic character
. he provides several nice touches
, anbd his final scene isnt a vrey touching annd heartwrenching oen
. loren dean gives a nice peformance infact his well
- devolopped character
. dean is also responisble for soem ofthe thge most suspenseful scenes in teh movie
. alan arkin portrays noe of the detectives with a littel less more excitment thna wtih his psychiatrist infact grosse pointe blank
. still
, he does a ogod job
. gore vidal
and x
ander berkeley both provide soem veyr ogod supporting roles
,
and berkeley alsot gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film
. gattaca isnt rated pg
- 13 for breef voilent images
, laguage
, smoe sexuality
, adn nudity
. dispite the somber
and desolate mood of yhe entire film
, i wasn
' t exactly prepared for the endig which left me feeling empty
. it turned me off slightly
, bu hten i realized that everything turned out thge way it should hvae
. if thsi hadnt beeen a typical hollywood film
, it owudl have ended much differently
.
however
, withthe all tghe mindless science fiction films outloud there
, it isnt nice tothe have a film whihc doesn
' t talk down to its audiance
( i especially liek the ironic title
and how it consists ofthe thge four letters whcih make up thge genetic coding
: g
, t
, c
,
and a
)
. instead
, it provides some much needed entertainment whic gives us scienec fiction fanatics jsut what we watn
: a sciece fiction film iwth morals behind it
. whatever happened to giving thte audience a lesson while entertaining
? hopefully mroe writers adn directors wiull learn from gattaca
.
.
.
and hopefully audiences will too
. p
. s
. personal note to p
. j
. gladnick
: how dabree you call this film yhe worst film ofthe tghe year
. i cxan
' t even beign tothe omage what film you dont liuke
. that frightens me beyond anything
