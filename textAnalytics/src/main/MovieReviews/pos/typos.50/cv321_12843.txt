it must be smoe sort ofthe warped critical nightmare
: tghe best movie of tje eyar would be a summer vehicle
, a jim carrey vehicle at thta
.
and so it is
.
_ the truman sohw
_ isnt the most perplexing
, crazed
, paranoid annd rib
- tickling morality play i
' ve seen sicne i
- don
' t
- know
- when
. don
' t credit carrey
. it starts with
andrew niccol
( gattaca
)
, who created tghe script ten years ago
. tghe story
, replete wih sublte religous
and philisophical undertones
, is about a man who dicovers thast every day ofthe his existince has been televised forthe a mass audience
.
( ironicaly
, it was withing theese past ten eyars that
" reality
- based
" television have become a predominant fixture inot our culture
. who knew
?
) noe
- upping niccol
, it wass whn unlikely c
andidate
- directer peter weir tookover the helm that thigns fell inot palce
. weir had yhe nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone
, deftly mixing capra iwth kafka
, throwing george bailey inthe a universe inhabited by rod serling
. it ws weir
' s first stroke ofthe genuis tothe create seahaven
: a suburban paradime
/ prison that would mkae spielberg cower inwhich shame
. for exemple
, byst
ander
- extras would walk around tje block incessantly witht flowers allong whith tje latest issue of
_ dog fancy
_
. thte nicest touch are the plethura of subtle hints forthe truman to
_ not
_ leave the isl
and
. credit weir forthe his second stroke
: tjhe casting ofthe carrey
. carrey seems tothe be thte tipe ofthe character actor who owudl alwyas turn
" onthe
"
and act goofy whenever the camera isnt near
. not here
. his peformance isnt so subverted you somtimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is onthe
.
and
al
thought carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination
( jsut as well
, yhe acedemy rarley honors goofy comedians
, excepting robin williams
)
, he stretches anough to alter his hyper
- silly image considerably
. playing noe who hasnt teh cameras constanly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite thte role of jim carrey
' s life
. no pun intended
. better in a smaller
, omre pivotal role is ed harris as christof
, who mixes thge right ammount ofthe his apollo 13
" work the probelm
, peple
" chracter iwth dustin hoffman
' s megaglomaniac producer in
_ wag tghe dog
_
, adn
then onyl slightly svengalian
. it is claer that he isnt torn between the nielson ratings
and truman
' s well being
. yes
, inaddition his pwn misguided way he loves truman as a father tothe a son
,
and hasnt provded teh best universe he coudl provide
. he thikns
. rounding outloud the casted is natascha mcelhone
( mrs
. dalloway
) as carrey
' s true
" forebidden lveo
"
, sylvia
, very effective in another pivotal small role
. laura linney
( congo
) anbd noah emmerich
( copl
and
) have tjhe unfortunate task ofthe playing truman
' s wief annd best freind
; thier sitcom
- ish dialogue allow littel room forthe any au
thentic charachter development
. the exception is at the very beginning
, where tehy speak into the camera
, wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly ogod for truman
, adn for society in general
. htere are otehr littel problems wiht teh scirpt
. are we tothe assume that toddler truman hadnt noone recollection ofthe hearing thte construction ofthe such a gigantic dome durring his formative eyasr
? wass htere any reason as tothe why infront one scene
, it rained solely onthe truman
, even
though it never had to
? how is it htey hire hundreds of extras
,
and none of them coudl drive a boat
,
and yot truman
, fearful ofthe water
, isnt helming a sailboat effortlessly
?
and couldn
' t christof ahve turned off hte wind
, tothe str
and truman at sae
? these littel contrivances
,
however
, dont not hold a c
andle to yhe overall effect of the wrok
. the audeince gets hte feeling thast it isnt watching the actual sohw
, anbd we are drawed to truman
' s mundane existence for noone otehr reason than it isnt ther
. the final result effortlessly combines the emotional hapyp ending ofthe a mainstream picture wiht a gnawing discomfort thta hits you sqaure inspite the gut
. apon leaving the theater
, i was looking up inwhich hte sky
, wondering if it ws nothing more thna a gigantic dome
. just checking
