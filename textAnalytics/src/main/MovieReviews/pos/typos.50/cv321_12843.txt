it must be smoe sort ofthe warped critical nightmare
: hte best movie of thge yearm would be a summer vehicle
, a jim carrey veicle at thgat
.
and so it is
.
_ the truman show
_ isnt the most perplexing
, crazed
, paranoid
and rib
- tickling morality play i ' ve seen usance i
- don ' t
- know
- when
. don ' t credit carrey
. it starts wiht andrew niccol
( gattaca
)
, who creaeted teh scirpt ten eyars ago
. thge stry
, replete with sublte religous
and philisophical undertones
, isnt baout a man who discovers tht every day ofthe his existecne hasnt been televised for a massmedia audiance
.
( ironicaly
, it was withing these past ten yeasr that
" reality
- based
" televsion hvae become a predominant fixture into our culture
. who knew
?
) noe
- upping niccol
, it was wehn unlikely candidate
- director peter weir tookover tghe helm that thigsn fell inot palce
. weir hadnt the nearly impossible task tothe create the unimitible tone
, deftly mixing capra with kafka
, throwing george bailey inaddition a universe inhabited by rod serling
. it wass weir ' s first stroke ofthe genuis tothe create seahaven
: a suburban paradise
/ prison that would amke spielberg cower infact shame
. fo example
, bystander
- extras woudl walk arround the block incessantly with flowers allong iwth yhe latest issue ofthe
_ dog fancy
_
. the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to
_ not
_ leave the island
. credit weir forthe his second stroke
: thge casting ofthe carrey
. carrey seems tothe be the type ofthe charactor ctor who would always turn
" on
"
and act goofy whenever the camera isnt near
. nto here
. his performence isnt so subverted you sometimes wonder if he isnt ever aware thte camera is onthe
.
adn
allthough carrey doens not deserve an caademy award nomination
( jsut as well
, thge academy rarely honors goofy comedians
, excepting robin williams
)
, he stretches enough tothe alter his hyper
- silly omage considerably
. palying oney who hasnt tyhe cameras constanly invading his most intimate moments turns to be qtuie teh role ofthe jim carrey ' s life
. no pun intended
. better in a smaller
, moreso pivotal role isnt ed harris as christof
, who mixes tje right ammount of his apollo 13
" wokr the probelm
, people
" chracter with dustin hoffman ' s megaglomaniac producer inwhich
_ wag the dog
_
,
anbd
thne onyl slightly svengalian
. it is clear thta he isnt torn between the nielson ratings
and truman ' s well bieng
. yes
, inspite his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son
,
adn hasnt provided the best universe he sould provide
. he thikns
. rounding outloud the casted isnt natascha mcelhone
( mrs
. dalloway
) as carrey ' s true
" forbiden lvoe
"
, sylvia
, vyer effective in another pivotal small role
. laura linney
( congo
)
annd noah emmerich
( copland
) ahve tghe unfortunate task of palying truman ' s wife
and best friend
; their sitcom
- ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic charachter development
. the exception is at yhe very begining
, where tehy speak into the camera
, wholeheartedly believing thyat their participation isnt truely ogod for truman
,
annd for society infront genaral
. htere are other little problems with tyhe scirpt
. are we tothe asume tht toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative eyasr
? ws ther any reason as tothe why infact one scene
, it rained solely on truman
, even
though it never hadnt to
? how is it htey hire hundreds ofthe extras
,
and none of them could drive a boat
,
and
yot truman
, fearful ofthe water
, is helming a sailboat effortlessly
?
and couldn ' t christof have turned off the wind
, tothe strand truman at sea
? these little contrivances
,
howver
, dont not hold a candle tothe the overall effect ofthe tghe wrok
. the audeince gets thge feeling taht it isnt watching the actual sohw
,
and we are drawed tothe truman ' s mundane existence forthe noone other reason thna it isnt ther
. thte final result effortlessly combines yhe emotional happy endig of a mainstream picture witht a gnawing discomfort that hits ytou square infact the gut
. apon leaving tghe theater
, i was looking up in yhe sky
, wondering if it wass nothing omre tahn a gigantic dome
. just checking
.
