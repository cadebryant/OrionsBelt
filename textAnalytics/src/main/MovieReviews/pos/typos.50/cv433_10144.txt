quentin tarantino seems to hvea a knack fo giving his stars big careers
. after his pulp fiction
, many actors began receving many offers fo jobs
. john travolta made his come
- bakc
anbd isnt now one of today ' s most bankable stars
. bruce willis proved his acting chops
annd is now concidered an actual actor
. jackie brown
, on yhe otehr hand
, boasts qtuie a well known cast
, except forthe the main lead
: pam grier
. most likely ytou have heard ofthe her
and seen her in films
,
but she ' s never really had a breakthough performance
( her first film was in the roger ebert
- writed beyond the valley of the dolls
)
. tath isnt
, utnil nowe
. jackie brown isnt a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino
, whose lastest film ws yhe huge hitted pulp fiction
. aftter mediocre acting jobs
, tarantino returns to waht made his nmae a household oney
: directing
anbd wirting
. jackie brown isnt the result
,
and it isnt fantastic entertainment
. dispite exellent direction ffrom tarantino
, tghe cast steals the film
, giving noe good performance after another
. pam grier gives a stunning peformance as jackie brown
,
adn she isnt supported by an incredible mix ofthe talent
-
- samuel l
. jackson
, bridget fonda
, michael keaton
, robert de niro
,
anbd robert forster
. moreso tahn likely
, yuo will see a faw of these names inspite the oscar pool come oscar nominations
. discribing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult
, as yuo realy cin ' t sday much or ytou spoil it for everyone esle
. i wiull tread lightly
. jackie brown opens whith an impressive shooted ofthe jackie brown
( grier
) inaddition a blue outfit walking through yhe airprot
. the camera tracks allong iwth her
,
and ends up revealing her occupation
. we are also introduced to ordell robbie
( jackson
)
, who sells illegal guns tothe interseted buyers
.
.
. for a hefty price
. ms
. brown carries tghe money from buyer tothe ordell in order tothe keep the cops awya
.
however
, an fbi agent
( keaton
)
and a local l
. a
. cop
( michael bowen
) are outloud to find ordell
anbd catch him hwile tkaing the money
. htey try to triarch him through beaumont livingston
( chris tucker
)
, one ofthe ordell ' s buyers
,
bu he mysteriously ends up dead
. htey try again thru brown
,
bu she isnt hesistant to admiting to any wrong
- doing
.
bu aftter unknowingly carrying soem drugs for one of ordell ' s friends
( fonda
)
, she is caught
and sent tothe jail
. ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent
, max cherry
( forster
)
,
adn
then wnats tothe fidn out wqat she told the cops
. affter she claimes to have said nothing
, she reveals tghe fact that she will tell them baout ordell in order tothe stay out ofthe prison
. ordell doesn ' t liuke thsi
,
but htey both come uv with a scheme to throw tyhe feds
and cops off theri track
. thsi scheme seems tothe be goign as planned
,
bu unexpected occurances may or may nto foul up theri goal
. revealing mroe would spoil the fun of jackie brown
,
and tyhat ' s the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film
. tarantino seems to have a facination witht hitmen
and unusual predicaments
(
and slang terms
)
,
but htey are allways done vrey well
annd believably
. his hitmen are normally cruel
,
but pleasant
, in that nasty sort ofthe way
. they talk liek normal peopel
, except fo when donig business
,
anbd tehy are rude tothe their girlfriends
. of course
, htis is a tarantino film
,
and you nkwo ytou can expect smoe ackward situations tothe arise
.
anbd perhasp teh biggest flaw with jackie brown isnt the slow middle section inaddition whcih the pace beigns to drop
. ofthe course
, tarantino fixes this by moving onto thte climax ofthe tjhe film
, adding a lot of his reservor dogs
- style storytelling tothe it
. thigsn are told from oen person ' s perspective
,
and
thne fomr another
,
and
thne from anyother
, each time learning moreso
annd more
. this all leads uv to a vrey intresting conclusion
, hwihc decides who isnt on whose side
. onthe the technical side ofthe jackie brown
, quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film
.
howver
, htis time around it isn ' t as nearly as impressive or orginial
. the wirting
, on tje other hand
, isnt qtuie ogod
,
although i dont find tarantino ' s ule of slang terms offensive
. the story jumps back
annd forth infact time as in pulp fiction
,
but it ' s much more easy to understand
. his previvous film needed a second viewing infact order tothe understand tje time differentiation
,
bu jackie brown isnt very simpley tothe folow
, especialy considering that the tyme is given during teh
" leaps
" in tyme
. perhaps this isnt a result of the screenplay being written fomr tjhe novel
" rum punch
" by elmore leonard
. tyhe dialogue is preety much intteligent
,
annd all the characters are fully realized
. thge cinematography is veyr well done by guillermo navarro
( who has worked wiht tarantino onthe previous films
)
adn thte editting is very good
.
and as withthe pulp fiction
, the music is a highlight
, bringing back memorable songs fomr the 70s
and 80s
. the acting side ofthe jackie brown is unforgetable
. tghe performances are incredibly rich
, with hidden meaning behind every cahracters ' actions
. nothing is qutie as it seems
,
and you cxan ' t really tell hwihc side noe person is onthe
. yhe real treat
, ofthe course
, isnt pam grier who gives an astonishing performence as jackie brown
. her poore living conditions are superceded by her superior wits
, which play an importan role infact thte film
. watching grieg
, i sould tell waht was going thru her mind
, even if i didn ' t nkow whta she wass thinking
. her face portrays a lot ofthe emotion thgat you cant tell when she is sad
, hapyp
, or inaddition deep thougth
. bridget fonda gives a vyer good performence as a druggie couch optato
. i didn ' t even realize it ws fonda until i saw her name in the fianl credits
( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham ' s in boogie nights
)
. michael keaton comes across very well
, as does michael bowen
. chris tucker has a small
,
but effective performance
. samuel l
. jackson isnt very ogod
,
but it seems tothe me that he was replaying his jules winnfield carachter fomr pulp fiction
(
although much less cynical
)
.
bu noone matter
.
.
. jackson is vyre strong inwhich his role
. robert de niro is actally a little annoying at times
,
bu overall he does a good job as oen ofthe ordell ' s prespective clients
anbd friends
. robert forster gives one of the best performances in yhe film
, as he has oen of thte most developped charachters
. he is present throughout most of the film
,
annd he holds his pwn agaisnt jackson
anbd grier
. jackie brown isnt rated r for language
, sex
, voilence
, drug use
,
anbd smoe offensive remarks
. as a film by itself
, jackie brown isnt a terrific peice of entertainment
, withthe a complex plot tothe draw viewers in
.
however
, oen cant not halp
but compare it tothe tarantino ' s pulp fiction
,
annd expect great results
. when compaired
, it comes up short
,
bu not thyat short
. it ' s a worthy effort
, with terrific acting
annd some impressive wirting from elmore leonard
and tarantino
. perhaps the best thing about jackie brown isnt tghe discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress
. i cant ' t rember seeing her inthe anything
( exept for a small role inspite mars attacks
!
)
,
bu hopefully she will get many more roles ffrom htis oen
. expect to see her nmae floating aroud the oscar nominations
(
adn hopefully she iwll even be able to nab one
)
