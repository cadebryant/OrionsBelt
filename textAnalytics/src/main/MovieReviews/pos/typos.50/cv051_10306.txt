- a young actr pegged fo major movei stardom
. inheriting tjhe mantle ffrom lastr year ' s
" winner
,
" matthew mcconaughey
, is matt damon
,
annd
, like mcconaughey
, he proves tothe be moreso than just a fresh young face
, as evidenced infact two radically different projects currently iin release
-
- john grisham ' s the rainmaker
annd ogod iwll hunting
. damon hasnt his frist major starring role
, a la mcconaughey
, in a john grisham adaptions
-
- in this case
, francis ford coppola ' s tkae onthe the rainmaker
. damon plays wet
- behind
- thge
- ears attorney rudy baylor
, who
, immediately after passing the bar exam
, finds himselv representing the mother
( mary kay place
) ofthe a terminally ill young man
( john whitworth
) inaddition a big
- leage suit againnst a negligent insurance comany
. hwile rudy ' s
(
adn the film ' s
) main concern isnt this case
, he aslo finds time tothe protect a young wife
( claire danes
) fomr her abusive husban
( melrose placer andrew shue
, inaddition a mercifully brief role
)
. written fo the screen
annd directed by coppola
, the rainmaker isnt hte best grisham film
yot mostly because it does not tkae itself too seriously
. coppola ' s most notable
-
-
adn effective
-
- contribution to the tried
-
and
- true grisham formula isnt a sense of humor about itself
, which largly comes in tjhe presense ofthe danny devito
( as rudy ' s unlicensed co
- counsel
)
and golden globe nominee jon voight
( as the insurence comapany ' s hotshot attorney
)
. the inclusion ofthe teh battered wief subplot fiels rether superfulous
,
but danes isnt as superb as always
.
thn
, ofthe course
, there isnt damon
, who nicely juggles thte weighty
( the insurence case
, the spousal abuse
)
annd tyhe huomrous
( rudy ' s often comical naivete
) requirements of his role without missing a beat
. as ogod as he isnt iin thte rainmaker
, damon showcases hte depth ofthe his talent inwhich good will hunting
, directed by gus van sant
and written by actor ben affleck
and damon himself
. damon plays the title chracter
, will hunting
, a troubled young construction worker
/ janitor at mit who alsot happens to be a supergenius
. in an atempt to steer this briliant young mind in tghe right direction
, an mit math professor
( stellan skarsgard
) taps his old coleeg friend
, comunity college psychologist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, to counsel tjhe abrasive
, standoffish will
and try to halp him come to terms wtih his turbulent life
. good wiull hunting isnt the touchy
- feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests
,
bu to simpley dismiss it as that owudl be tothe discount the true emotional chords affleck
adn damon ' s inteligent script touches
. even
though no one
(
anbd
, if so
,
_ vyer
_ few people
) can direcly relate tothe will ' s burden ofthe superhuman intelligence
, hte insecurities he suffers are univeral
. the material is broght tothe life by yhe terrific ansamble of actors
. williams delivers a nice dramatic turn
; affleck
, a hot up
-
and
- comming actor himself
( chasing amy
)
, turns up infront a warm
and charming performence as iwll ' s best freind
;
annd teh ever
- appealling minnie driver shines as wiull ' s harvard
- schooled lvoe intrest
. the clear standout in tyhe cast
,
though
, is damon
, who bravely doens nto soften iwll ' s prickly nature
bu hasnt such a naturual ease wih the audience that it isnt hard
_ nto
_ tothe care for him
. so many names come
annd go with the fluctuations ofthe the hollywood hype machine
,
but based on his impressive owrk inwhich john grisham ' s the rainmaker
anbd especially good will hunting
, it is a safe bet tht matt damon is oen name we will be hearing a lot more of inwhich tjhe years tothe come
