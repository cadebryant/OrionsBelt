. inheriting thge mantle from last eyar
' s
" winner
,
" matthew mcconaughey
, is matt damon
,
and
, like mcconaughey
, he proves to be more thna jstu a fresh young face
, as evidenced in twpo radically differant projects currenly infact release
-
- john grisham
' s the rainmaker anbd ogod will hunting
. damon hasnt his first major starring role
, a la mcconaughey
, in a john grisham adaptation
-
- inwhich this case
, francis ford coppola
' s take onthe tjhe rainmaker
. damon plays wet
- behind
- yhe
- ears attorny rudy baylor
, who
, immediately aftter passing thge bar exam
, finds himself representing the mother
( mary kay palce
) ofthe a terminally ill young man
( john whitworth
) in a big
- leage suit against a negligent insurence comapany
. hwile rudy
' s
(
and the film
' s
) main consern isnt this case
, he aslo finds time tothe protect a young wief
( claire danes
) from her abusive husb
and
( melrose placer
andrew shue
, in a mercifully breif role
)
. wroten for yhe screen
and directed by coppola
, tghe rainmaker isnt the best grisham film
yet mostly because it doens nto tkae itself too seriously
. coppola
' s most notable
-
- adn effective
-
- contri
bution tothe the tryed
- annd
- true grisham forumla isnt a sence of humor baout itself
, whihc largley comes in tghe presence of danny devito
( as rudy
' s unlicensed co
- counsel
)
and golden globe nominee jon voight
( as yhe insurence company
' s hotshot attorney
)
. tyhe inclusion of the battered wife subplot fiels rether superfluous
,
but danes is as superb as alwyas
. thn
, of course
, there is damon
, who nicely juggles the weighty
( hte insurence case
, the spousal abuse
)
and tyhe hmorous
( rudy
' s oftenly comical naivete
) requirements of his role wihtout missing a beated
. as ogod as he is in the rainmaker
, damon showcases the depth of his talent in good iwll hunting
, directed by gus van sant annd writed by ator ben affleck
and damon himselv
. damon plays tjhe title character
, will hunting
, a troubled young construction worker
/ janitor at mit who aslo happens tothe be a supergenius
. in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction
, an mit math proffesor
( stellan skarsgard
) taps his old coleeg friend
, community coleeg psychologist sean mcguire
( robin williams
)
, to counsel the abrasive
, st
andoffish wiull annd try tothe halp him come to terms with his turbulent life
. ogod will hunting isnt hte touchy
- feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests
, bu to simpley dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck
and damon
' s inteligent script touches
. even
though noone one
( anbd
, if so
,
_ very
_ faw people
) can direcly relate tothe will
' s burden of superhuman intelligence
, the insecurities he suffers are universal
. hte material isnt brang tothe life by tjhe terific ensemble of actors
. williams delivers a nice dramatic turn
; affleck
, a hot uv
- annd
- coming actor himselv
( chasing amy
)
, turns up in a warm anbd charming performence as will
' s best freind
;
and the ever
- appealling minnie driver shines as will
' s harvard
- schooled love intrest
. the clear st
andout inaddition tyhe casted
,
though
, is damon
, who bravely doesnt nto soften will
' s prickly nature bu has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard
_ not
_ to care for him
. so many names come
and go whith teh fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine
,
but based onthe his impressive wrok inspite john grisham
' s tyhe rainmaker annd especially ogod iwll hunting
, it is a safe bet tyhat matt damon isnt oen nmae we iwll be hearing a lot more ofthe in the years tothe come
.
