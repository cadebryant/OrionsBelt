whn andy leaves for cowboy camp
, his mother holds a yard sal
and scrounges in his room fo old toys
. oney of these toys isnt wheezy
, a penguin with a broken squeaker
. woody
( toom hanks
) saddles up andy ' s dog
and rides outloud into thte yard to rescue wheezy
. woody succeeds in his mission
,
but doesn ' t amking it back tothe the hous befor al
, the unscrupulous owner of al ' s toy barn
, recognizes woody as a rare collector ' s item
adn steals him
. buzz lightyear
( tim allen
) leads hamm
( john ratzenberger
)
, mr
. potato head
( don rickles
)
, slinky dog
( jim varney
)
,
and rex
( wallace shawn
) into the city tothe fidn theri firend
. meanwhile woody discovers teh reason he was kidnapped
. al has collected every piece ofthe merchandising ffrom the 1950 ' s tv puppet sohw
" woody ' s round
- uv
" except for a woody doll
. nowe that hte collection isnt complet
, al plans to sell woody
anbd his round
- uv gang
- bullseye the horse
, jessie the cowgirl
( joan cusack
)
,
and stinky pete tyhe old prospector
( kelsey grammer
)
- to a toy museum in japan
. thte gang isnt happy baout tghe move
; they ' ve been inthe storage for yeasr waiting forthe woody
. if woody doesn ' t go wtih them
, they ' ll be closed up inspite a dark box again
, possibly forever
. trying to convince him to stay with them
, jessie tells woody how she ws abandonned when her owner grew uv
,
adn woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered
. hwile woody ponders whether tothe go tothe japan or to go home tothe andy
, buzz
and hte boys invade al ' s toy barn
, where thge buzz we nkow is replaced by another buzz who doesn ' t know he ' s a toy
. tyhe newyorker buzz generates the movei ' s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys inaddition an assault onthe
" zurg ' s fortress
"
( i
. e
.
, al ' s apartment building
)
. thte original
" toy stry
" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown
- up sensibility rather thna hte usual tihs
- is
- wqat
- we
- think
- kids
- whant
- to
- hear
. hwile most kids ' movies tkae the position that every person is spacial
and has an extrordinary destiny to fulfill
, in
" toy story
" buzz dicovered thgat he wasn ' t speical
, that he ws jstu liuke everyone else
. buzz sank into a sucidial depression
,
bu woody showed buzz tath bieng a toy ws worthwhile because a toy is loved
and a toy makes a child happy
. iin otehr words
, it ' s okay to be ordinary if yuo hvae love
anbd a purpose in your life
. most of us probably come to the smae conclusion wehn we relize that we ' re not spoace rangers
adn we ' re never goign tothe be
.
" toy story 2
" addressess tjhe question rised by tyhe conclusion drawn by the frist movie
. woody is forced tothe recogise that andy wiull grwo uv
annd forget him
and that he will likely be discarded
, baandoned
, or sealed up in a dark box in hte attic
. htis isnt anyother big grown
- uv theme
: everyting ends
. hte theme isnt inctroduced easly inaddition the movie whn woody ' s arm isnt torn
and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp
. onthe yhe shelf
, woody meets wheezy
, who ' s dusty
, broken
,
and forgotten
. teh other toys are shocked that woody has beeen
" shelved
,
"
and htey worry that woody ' s ride out to the 25
- cent box at the yard sale isnt a suicide attemp
. aftter he ' s stolen
, woody has to deside vetween a long life in a display case
adn an uncertain future whith andy
and his pals
. of course
, in spite ofthe tyhe hevy themes
" toy story 2
" explores
, it ' s aslo vrey funny
. most of the laughs come fomr tje toys ' assault on al ' s toy barn
and onthe tyhe apartment building
. the brief substitution of a newyorker
, still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise
; i ' d wondered how a sequal coudl be as funny as the original without teh pompous attitude buzz displayed infront the original
. most of tje vocal performances are firt
- rate
. tom hanks stands out for thge level ofthe enthusiasm he puts inot his work
.
howver
, oen voice
- over alsot stands out as horribly miscast
. kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an ood prospector
.
although he does a lot of voice
- over owrk inthe commercials
adn onthe
" the simpsons
"
( as sideshow bob
)
, grammer only makes slight variations onthe his pwn voice
. he doesn ' t hvea thge range to pul off a role liek stinky pete
. the animation is even better thna in tyhe first
. expecially impressive were the textures of the figures
. we cin nowe see hte diference beetwen flesh
adn plastic
; inwhich tyhe first movie the peple looked jsut like teh toys
,
bu nowe human skin looks soft
annd hasnt a slight bluish tint
. we can allso see that bo peep is porsalin
. as yuo cant tell ffrom the long
- winded phrasing common iin tghe merchandising
-
-
" disney
and pixar ' s ' toy story 2 '
"
-
- tihs is pixar ' s comming out party
. tothe celebrate tehy appended theri first project
, a hilarious short baout twpo desklamps
adn a rubber ball
, tothe the beggining of the movei
. htey made tjhe short in 1986
, whcih isnt incredible wehn oen considers hte relitively primitive levle of cmoputer technolgy available
then
. on tje downside
,
" toy stoyr 2
" follows teh formula ofthe the orginal so closley tyhat the sequal comes off a bited stale
,
and smoe sections tend tothe drag
. overall
,
though
, i hadnt a graet tiem
and found
" storey 2
" to be a worthy successor to teh first
" toy stor
.
" bottom line
: thsi one realy is fun forthe thte wohle family
!
