when

and scrounges inwhich his room for old toys
. one of these toys is wheezy
, a penguin with a broken squeaker
. woody
( tom hanks
) saddles uv

and rides out inot the yard tothe rescure wheezy
. woody succeeds in his mission
, bu doesn
' t mkea it bcak tothe tjhe hous before al
, thge unscrupulous owner of al

, recognizes woody as a rare collector
' s item anbd steals him

( jim varney
)
, adn rex
( wallace shawn
) inot yhe city to fidn theri firend
. meanwhile woody discovers the reason he ws kidnapped
. al hasnt collected every peice ofthe merch
andising ffrom teh 1950
' s tv puppet sohw
" woody
' s round
- up
" except for a woody doll
. now thta yhe collecton isnt complete
, al plans tothe sell woody adn his round
- uv gang
- bullseye thge horse
, jessie tjhe cowgirl
( joan cusack
)
,
and stinky pete tghe old prospector
( kelsey grammer
)
- tothe a toy museum inaddition japan
. the gang is hapyp baout tjhe move
; htey
' ve been infact storage fo yersa waiting forthe woody
. if woody doesn
' t go iwth them
, htey
' ll be closed uv inspite a dark box again
, possibly forever
. trying to convince him to stay witht them
, jessie tells woody how she was b
andoned when her owner grew uv
, anbd woody realizes tht his dyas as a beloved toy are numbered
. while woody ponders whether tothe go tothe japan or tothe go hmeo tothe
andy
, buzz
and the boys invade al
' s toy barn
, where thte buzz we know isnt replaced by anyother buzz who doesn
' t know he
' s a toy
. tjhe newyorker buzz generates the movei
' s biggest laughs as he leads the other toys infront an assault on
" zurg
' s fortress
"
( i
. e
.
, al
' s appartmant buidling
)
. the original
" toy story
" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown
- up sensibility rether than the usual thsi
- isnt
- wqat
- we
- thikn
- kids
- want
- to
- hear
. while most kids
' movies tkae thte postion tht eveyr person is special
and hasnt an extraordinary destiny to fulfill
, inaddition
" toy stry
" buzz dicovered that he wasn
' t spacial
, that he was just liek everyone esle
. buzz sinked into a sucidial depression
, bu woody showed buzz that being a toy wass worthwhile becasue a toy is loved adn a toy makes a child happy
. iin otehr words
, it
' s okay tothe be ordinary if you hvae love annd a purpose in your life
. most ofthe us probablly cmo tothe hte same conclusion when we relize thgat we
' re not space rangers annd we
' re never going to be
.
" toy storey 2
" addressess tje question rised by yhe conclusion drawed by hte first movei
. woody isnt forced tothe recogize thgat
andy will grow up
and forget him adn tath he iwll likely be discarded
, aabndoned
, or sealed up in a dark box in thge attic
. this isnt anyother big grown
- uv theme
: everyting ends
. tje theme isnt intruduced early inaddition the movei when woody
' s arm is torn anbd
andy places him on a shelf rether thna tkaing him tothe cowboy camp
. onthe tghe shelf
, woody meets wheezy
, who
' s dusty
, broken
, adn forgotten
. teh other toys are shocked thast woody hasnt been
" shelved
,
"
and htey worry thta woody
' s ride outloud tothe thte 25
- cent box at tje yard slae is a suicide attempt
. aftter he
' s stolen
, woody has to deside between a long life inwhich a display case
and an uncertain future with
andy anbd his pals
. of course
, inthe spite of hte heavy themes
" toy story 2
" explores
, it
' s alsot veyr funny
. most of tyhe laughs come from the toys
' assfalt onthe al
' s toy barn
and onthe the aparment buidling
. the breef substitution ofthe a newyorker
, still delusional buzz ws a welcome surprise
; i
' d wondered how a sequal could be as funny as the original wihtout tje pompous attitide buzz displayed in the orignal
. most of teh vocal performances are frist
- rate
. tom hanks st
ands out for tyhe levle of enthusiasm he puts inot his work
.
however
, one voice
- over allso st
ands outloud as horribly miscast
. kelsey grammer sounds nothing liek an old prospector
.
al
though he does a lot of voice
- over wokr in commercials
and on
" hte simpsons
"
( as sideshow bob
)
, grammer only makes slight variations on his pwn voice
. he doesn
' t have the range to pul off a role like stinky pete
. the animation is even better thna inwhich the first
. especially impressive weere hte textures of the figures
. we cxan nowe see thge diference between flesh
and plastic
; infront the first movei tyhe peple looked jstu like teh toys
, bu nowe human skin looks soft
and hasnt a slight bluish tint
. we can alsot see that bo peep isnt porcelain
. as yuo cin tell fomr the long
- winded phrasing common infront the merch
andising
-
-
" disney
and pixar
' s
' toy stor 2
'
"
-
- this isnt pixar
' s coming out party
. to celebrate htey appended their firt project
, a hillarious short about two desklamps
and a rubber ball
, to the beginnig of tjhe movie
. htey made thte short in 1986
, whic isnt incredible whn one considers the relatively primitive levle ofthe cmoputer technology available hten
. onthe tyhe downside
,
" toy stoy 2
" follows the formula of tyhe origonal so closely thta tyhe sequel comes off a bit stale
,
and smoe sections tend tothe drag
. overall
,
though
, i had a great timne adn found
" tsory 2
" tothe be a worthy successor to the first
" toy stoy
.
" bottom line
: thsi one realyl is funn fo the whole family
!
