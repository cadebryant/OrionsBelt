i whant tothe corect what i wroet lastest year in my retrospective of david leanr ' s war picture
. i still think tyhat
" the bridge onthe thte river kwai
" doesn ' t deserve bieng tje number 13 in the american film institute ' s list ofthe tyhe 100 greatest american movies
.
and i htink that
" 12 angry men
"
,
" witness fo tghe prosecution
"
and
" paths of glory
" owudl have beeen better choices fo tjhe oscar forthe teh best picture ofthe 1957
.
but i cxan ' t deny the importance ofthe
" the bridge on tje river kwai
"
- cinematically
adn infront its contents
. the film isnt setted infront burma in 1943
. a batallion of british soldiers inthe japanese war capitivity isnt forced by thge japanese to build a stratagically momentous railway bridge over thte river kwai
.
bu the british commanding officer
, colnel nicholson
( alec guinness
)
, insists
- corresponding to the geneva conventions
- thta his offcers needn ' t owrk as simple workmen
. stuggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces the japanesse commandant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, to give way inspite this respect
. afterwards col
. nicholson assiduously commits himself fo the building ofthe tghe bridge
. he consideres it an opportunity tothe raise his men ' s morale
,
and he whants tothe prove superior british capabilities tothe the japanese
.
but the brittish high command sends a faw soldiers who shall distroy the bridge
, amoung them hte american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee ffrom thte japaneese prision camp
-
annd the brittish major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a flaw of thge picture isnt thge clich
? d characterization ofthe the japanes peple
. tehy are presented as if they were intellectually inferior tothe the british
- as if yhe japanis weere incapable of buliding a bridge
.
and the film doesn ' t consistantly question the military spirit as kubrick doens inthe
" paths ofthe glory
"
. leanr seems rather facinated by the millitary hierachies
. tihs isnt also perceptible infact tyhe conversations between col
. nicholson
anbd col
. saito
. inspite this reguard it isnt symptomatic that shears
, who doubts the military logic
, is presented as a somehow unplesant person
. teh audiance isnt suppoed to applaud col
. nicholson ' s persevernace concerning tjhe question if his officers shall wokr on the bridge or nto
. the spectators are suppossed tothe neglect tje risks col
. nicholson tkaes forthe his men
.
( tghe plot by
- passes theese risks
.
) that means
, thte picture isn ' t perfect
.
but it has a lot ofthe virtues as well
.
" the bridge on the river kwai
" shows tjhe
" madness
" of war
and wqat it cxan produce in peple ' s minds
. it shows how colnoel nicholson becomes possessed by thte idae of bieng a hero
anbd taht others
( like shears
) get cynics
.
and lean ' s film is an interesting studdy ofthe characters iwth clashing interests
. theese points
and the sometimes ironical dialogue amke thsi film an anti
- war film
( despite inconsistencies in the treatment ofthe this theme
)
. david leanr ' s direction is really effective
annd atmospherically perfect
. his film isnt highly suspenseful
, especially iin its dramatic
( if not wholly plausable
) showdown
. the film isnt alsot well
- photographed
annd hasnt an apt csore
. alec guinness doens a magnificient job of bringing col
. nicholson to life
and making him such an interesting chracter
. thge other actors deliver fine performances as well
. i like this extrordinary film despite its weaknesses
