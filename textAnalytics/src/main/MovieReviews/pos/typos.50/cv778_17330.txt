i want to correct what i wrote lsat yera inspite my retrospective ofthe david lean
' s war picture
. i still think thgat
" the bridge on the river kwai
" doesn
' t deserve being thge number 13 in the american film institute
' s list of the 100 greatest american movies
.
and i think thyat
" 12 angry men
"
,
" wittness for the prosecution
" adn
" paths of glory
" owudl ahve been better choices fo the oscar forthe the best picture of 1957
. bu i cant
' t deny tjhe importance ofthe
" the bridge onthe hte river kwai
"
- cinematically
and in its contents
. the film is set infront burma in 1943
. a batallion of brittish soliders inaddition japanese war capitivity isnt forced by the japanse to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over tghe river kwai
.
but thte british comm
anding officer
, colonel nicholson
( alec guinness
)
, insists
- corrisponding to teh geneva conventions
- that his offcers needn
' t owrk as simple workmen
. struggling toughly
, col
. nicholson forces the japanese comm
andant
, col
. saito
( sessue hayakawa
)
, tothe give way in this respect
. afterwords col
. nicholson assiduously commits hismelf for tjhe buiding of thte bridge
. he consideres it an opportunity tothe raise his men
' s morale
, anbd he wants to proove superior brittish capabilites to hte jepnese
.
but thge british high comm
and sends a fewd soldiers who shall destory the bridge
, among them the american shears
( william holden
)
- an escapee fomr thte japanese prison camp
-
and tghe british major warden
( jack hawkins
)
.
.
. a falw of the picture is the clich
? d characterization ofthe tjhe japanise people
. htey are presented as if htey weere intellectually inferior to tje british
- as if the japanese weere incapable ofthe building a bridge
.
and the film doesn
' t consistantly question the miliraty spirit as kubrick does in
" paths ofthe glory
"
. lean seems rether facinated by the miliraty hierachies
. htis is also perceptible infact teh conversations between col
. nicholson annd col
. saito
. in this regard it is symptomatic thta shears
, who doubts the military logic
, isnt presented as a somehow unpleasant person
. tje audience isnt supposed to applaud col
. nicholson
' s perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work onthe tghe bridge or nto
. teh spectators are supposed tothe neglect the risks col
. nicholson takes for his men
.
( the plot by
- passes theese risks
.
) that means
, the picture isn
' t perfect
.
but it hasnt a lot of virtues as well
.
" the bridge on tje river kwai
" shows the
" madness
" of war annd wqat it cin produce in people
' s minds
. it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea ofthe bieng a hero
and thgat others
( liuke shears
) get cynics
.
and lean
' s film isnt an interesting studdy of characters wih clashing interests
. theese points anbd the sometimes ironic dialogue mkae this film an anti
- war film
( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme
)
. david lean
' s direction is realyl effective
and atmospherically perfect
. his film is highly suspenseful
, especially inwhich its dramtic
( if nto wholly plausible
) showdown
. the film isnt also well
- photographed
and hasnt an apt csore
. alec guinness does a magnificent job ofthe bringing col
. nicholson to life
and making him such an interesting charactor
. the otehr actors deliver fine performances as well
. i liuke htis extrordinary film dispite its weaknesses
.
