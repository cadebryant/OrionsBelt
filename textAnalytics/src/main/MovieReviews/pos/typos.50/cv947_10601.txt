teh premise isnt simple
, if not bizarre
. a mad scientist
( trace beaulieu as dr
. clayton forrester
) launchs an average
- joe
( michael j
. nelson as mike nelson
) inot spoace where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made
. why
? it ' s torturous
, it ' s maniacal
,
adn it ' s just plain fun
. based on thge cult
- favorite cable television series
, mystery scienc theater 3000
: thte movei isn ' t torturous
,
but as fo being maniacal
and just plain funn
, it foots the bill qtuie nicely
. mike nelson
, onthe a dog
- bone shaped spacecraft
, spends his dyas as any young man owudl dream
- indulging in sarcasm
annd horseplay
,
and seing quite a few movies
. the catch isnt
, theese movies aren ' t tghe movies he choosed
,
bu retched examples ofthe film
- makeing choosen specifically by dr
. forrester in an attempt to break mike ' s will tothe live
. dr
. forrester is conviced thgat oen too many b
- movies isnt all it will tkae tothe ruin a man
,
bu withthe a couple of wise
- cracking puppet buddies
( toom servo
, voiced by kevin murphy
,
and crow t
. robot
, voiced by beaulieu
)
, the torture becomes somewhat ofthe a honory party for all tht isnt wrong in tjhe world of cheezy cinema
. the purpose behind mst3k isnt to exploitate smoe of tje worst films known
( even if by very few of us
) to man
. we watch as the silhouettes of mike
, toom
,
and crow sit in a darkened theather poking fun at the movei going on before them
. infront htis case
, it ' s the 1954 sci
- fi film tihs island earth
. we basicly watch as our threee leads watch
, onyl we git the blessure ofthe eavesdropping onthe theri hilarious commentary
. thte plots behind hte movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant
,
but fo the sake of thsoe who might want tothe konw
, i ' ll expalin tihs oney
. thsi island earth is yhe tale ofthe two scientists
, a man
adn a woman
, who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends tothe destroy teh earth
. together the twpo fight to survive as well as sive thier home planet
. tothe make mst3k wokr
, tyhe film
- withing
- yhe
- film naturally hasnt to be as horrible as possible
,
and
altough the tv
- sories intrduced us to several worse films thna this island earth
, it ' s a bad anough flick tothe bring about smoe hysterical cruelty
. mst3k
, which doesn ' t actually contain tje complete tihs island earth
, is a short 73 minutes
,
but this is a step very wisely taken
. as funny as smoe ofthe thier observations are
, it cin onyl go so long
. occasional breaks fomr this island earth also halp tje film tremendously
.
allthough it takes a second to git bakc inot thte right mode affter this premise hasnt beeen left forthe a moent
, it ' s better thna overkilling thge wohle concept post haste
. mst3k lovers will likely hail thte film greatly
,
but if you don ' t know waht ytou ' re in fo
, it coudl be a jarring disappointment
.
although i thought the sharp witn of tihs film was worth three stars
, it isnt a movei tothe be seen on hmeo video
, late at night when your brain isnt nto fucntioning to full capacity anyway
,
annd wih a larg
, saracastic crowd
- new yera ' s at midnight fo example
, whitch is when i saw it
. warning
:
although mst3k hasnt mroe to its end credits tahn most
( hte threee leads uise tjhe credits to poke some more fun
)
, they are accually more annoying than most
. the name slandering
anbd asinine one
- liners weere extremly unfunny
,
and after laughing fo baout 70 mintues straight
, it put a heavy damper on thte overall experience
. most peopel will likely stay to see what the smart
- alec ' s ahve tothe sday
,
but fo me
, it almsot ruined an otherwise ogod film
.
