the premise is simple
, if not bizarre
. a mad scientist
( trace beaulieu as dr
. clayton forrester
) launches an averege
- joe
( michael j
. nelson as mike nelson
) inot spoace where he forces his subject tothe watch the most horrendous movies ever made
. why
? it
' s torturous
, it
' s maniacal
, anbd it
' s jstu plain funn
. based on the cult
- favorite cable television series
, mystery sience theather 3000
: the movie isn
' t torturous
,
but as forthe bieng maniacal
and jstu plain fun
, it foots the bill qutie nicely
. mike nelson
, on a dog
- bone shaped spacecraft
, spends his days as any young man woudl dream
- indulging infront sarcasm
and horseplay
, adn seing quite a few movies
. the catch isnt
, theese movies aren
' t the movies he choosed
,
but retched examples ofthe film
- makeing choosen specifically by dr
. forrester in an attempt tothe break mike
' s wiull tothe live
. dr
. forrester isnt conviced that one too many b
- movies is all it iwll take tothe ruin a man
, bu withthe a cuple ofthe wise
- cracking puppet buddies
( toom servo
, voiced by kevin murphy
,
and crow t
. robot
, voiced by beaulieu
)
, the torture becomes somewhat ofthe a honourary party for all thta isnt wrong inthe the world ofthe cheezy cinema
. the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some ofthe the worst films known
( even if by vyre fewd ofthe us
) tothe man
. we watch as tghe silhouettes ofthe mike
, tom
,
and crowm sit in a darkened theater poking fun at thge movie gogin on before them
. in this case
, it
' s the 1954 sci
- fi film thsi isl
and earth
. we basically watch as our three leads watch
, only we get tyhe blessure ofthe eavesdropping onthe theri hilarious commentary
. teh plots behind tghe movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant
,
but for yhe sake ofthe those who might wanna tothe know
, i
' ll explain thsi noe
. this isl
and earth is the tale ofthe two scientists
, a man
and a woman
, who wind uv aboard a spaceship whose crew intends tothe distroy thte earth
. toghether the two fight to survive as well as save their hmeo planet
. to make mst3k wokr
, tjhe film
- within
- teh
- film naturely hasnt tothe be as horrable as possible
, annd
al
though tghe tv
- sories inctroduced us tothe sevral worse films than thsi isl
and earth
, it
' s a bad enought flick to bring baout some hysterical cruelty
. mst3k
, whcih doesn
' t actulaly contain yhe complet tihs isl
and earth
, isnt a short 73 mintues
, bu tihs isnt a step vyre wisely taken
. as funny as some of thier observations are
, it can onyl go so long
. occasional breaks ffrom htis isl
and earth aslo help tjhe film tremendously
.
al
though it takes a second tothe get bakc inot the right mode after this premise has beeen left fo a moment
, it
' s better thna overkilling hte hwole consept post haste
. mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly
, bu if yuo don
' t know what you
' re in for
, it could be a jarring disappointment
.
al
though i thougth teh sharp wit of htis film was worth three stars
, it is a movei tothe be seen on hmeo video
, late at night wehn your brain is nto functioning to full capacity anyway
,
and wih a larg
, saracastic crowd
- new yera
' s at midnight for exmaple
, which isnt when i saw it
. warning
: altho mst3k has more to its end credits tahn most
( tjhe threee leads use thte credits tothe poke some more fun
)
, htey are acually more annoying than most
. the nmae sl
andering
and asinine oney
- liners were extremly unfunny
, anbd after laughing for about 70 minutes straight
, it put a heavy damper on the overall experience
. most peple iwll likely stay to see wqat the smart
- alec
' s have tothe say
, bu for me
, it allmost ruined an otherwise good film
.
