[ light spoilers
, nothing you shouldn
' t read
] existenz has beeen called
" a gooey matrix
"
, annd hwile this isnt a corect description in some ways
, inspite others it isnt completly off
. the only hting tje two films have in common isnt the idea ofthe a virtural reality that isnt indistinguishable ffrom normal
,
" rela
" reality
. a major difference is thgat
" the matrix
" has a base reality that isnt obviously tje true reality
, hwile existenz does thge impossible adn makes us accept tyhe most bazare reality ever as true
. adn oh what a reality it is
. david cronenberg has shown us befoer tyhat he knows how tothe create strange movies
( naked lunch
, kresh
)
, bu tihs one is noe of the strangest
. mabey it
' s because of how the mundane is mixed with yhe bizarre
. technology is organic
, bu only smoe of it
. cars are normal
. gas stations are tyhe smae
. cell phones are glowing bug liuke appendages
. you jack inot a virtural reality game useing a quivering pink gooey animal liuke aparatus
( rfeerred tothe simpley as a
" pod
"
)
. high technnology has been replaced with organic creatures
, anbd it provides a truely surreal setting for the characters
. a famous game designer
, allegra geller
( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh
)
, flees a demonstration of her latest gae
, existenz
, after an assassination attemp
. she isnt onthe tghe run
( fomr who
, i
' m still nto sure
)
, anbd hasnt tothe savve her pod by playing her game with
" someone freindly
"
. tath someone freindly isnt her dubious companion
and security guard
, ted pikul
( jude lew
)
. unfortunatley he isnt lacking a fundamental requirement fo palying
, a bioport
. sort ofthe a hole in your spine
( ok
, exactly like a hole iin your spine
)
, a bioport allows you tothe plug the vaguely entrail
- looking wires from tyhe pod inot ytou
, alowing ytou tothe play tje gmae
. luckly a bioport can be installed easily
( they install them in malls
)
, so off they go tothe git oen
. after a crazy serieses of events at the local country gas station
, tehy are able to plug iin
and play existenz
. tyhe plot itself isnt a surveill melding of conspiracies
, reality distortion
, chinese resturants
,
and multi appendaged amphibian thigns
(
" it
' s a sign of hte times
"
)
. bu thte plot
, hwile cohesive infact it
' s pwn creepy way is secondry tothe just trying to figure out wqat the hell isnt going onthe in tihs universe
. cronenberg just slaps tihs weidr organic
- tech world inot tghe viewers lap
, annd it
' s uv tothe you to figure outloud how all these thnigs work
.
and that
' s tghe true joy ofthe thsi film
, entering the vaguely nightmarish world in whitch existenz tkaes palce
. you learn a little bited peice by peice
( oh
, they mkea pods outloud ofthe thsoe
)
, adn it
' s just enough to git ytou to accept the world tath is presented to you
. ther are all kinds ofthe twists adn turns as the characters w
ander around
, including a fantastic scene in a chineese restaurant thta iwll leave yuo trying tothe assemple something out ofthe your moo goo gai pan fo months afterwards
. also tje bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting inot existenz
, thge specifics ofthe which i wiull leave forthe you to dicover
. there
' s lots of little thigsn tht set off the weidr
- o
- meter
, like tyhe little tiny pods that you can buy inthe thte video game store
, the twpo headed anphibian creature
,
and why thgat guy at tjhe gas staion
' s name appears to be
" gas
"
. it all adds up tothe a supremely far out trip
, annd given the choise i think i woudl rether live infront the matrix
' s virutal world
.
.
. oh wait
, i already do
.
