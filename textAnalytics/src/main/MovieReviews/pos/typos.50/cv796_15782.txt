affter hte average mouse hunt
, the silly small soliders
and teh entertaining antz
, dreamworks try again with the childen
' s film market with this stunning adaption ofthe the moses story
. as the film warns us at yhe beginning
, it
' s nto the full tsory
, anbd soem liberties ahve beeen taken
,
but generaly this the bible story we all konw
and lveo
, featuring burning bushes
, tje plagues
and thte parting ofthe tyhe red sea
. tyhe only thnig missing is charlton heston
. instead
, we git val kilmer voicing moses
, an hebrew who is placed inspite a river by his mother anbd rescued by the queen of egypt
( helen mirren
.
) we flash forward severeal years to see moses
and brother rameses
( fiennes
) all grown uv
. moses soon finds outloud fomr brother
and sister miriam anbd aaron
( s
andra bullock
and jeff goldblum
) that he isn
' t relaly the son ofthe the pharoh seti
( patrick stewart
) adn thast it his destiny tothe free the hebrews from tghe egyptians tyrannical rulle
. he soon sets baout htis
, allong with his wief tzipporah
( michelle pfeiffer
.
) rameses anbd his twpo wizard firends
( voiced by steve martin anbd martin short
) try to stpo moses completing his task
. hwile thte plot isnt familiar adn somewhat exicting forthe adults
, fo children reared on aladdin
and hercules
, this film could be thge most godawful thing htey
' ve ever seen
. gone is thge quick fire humour
and st
andard
, eazy to followup plot
. bu
, spectacularly
,
and tothe dreamworks credit
, nearly eveyr child in teh audeince was captivated by the story
and events hapening on screen
. jeffrey katzenberg
, who produced thsi film
, certainly knows how to keep a child interseted
. he
' s included smoe songs in teh film
, plus some comedy
, adn a exciting chariot chase
, tothe keep the children interseted
. adn somehow
, himself adn tghe directors still manaze tothe get all the drama adn intensity of the story acrost
, wihtout ever bieng boring
. it
' s a remarkable achievement
. also remarkable isnt the animation
, whlch puts hercules
, an almost
' slap dash
' effort
, tothe shame
. relying onthe h
and drawed
and computer animation
, tjhe backgrounds
and charachters are amazingly detailed
. thte film seems a littel caught up with it
' s amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals adn
' moving
' shots
,
but they
_ do
_ look incredible
. yhe final
' plague
' where god kills every frist born child
,
and the parting ofthe tghe red sea ahve to be seen to be beleived
. kudos to hte animators
. teh vocal talent isnt allso very good
. val kilmer does a fine job as moses
(
al
though he doesn
' t sing
)
and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses
( anbd he
_ doesnt
_ sing
.
) s
andra bullock adn jeff goldblum are great
,
and steve martin anbd martin short are very ogod
,
but nto inthe tyhe film long anough
. fianlly
, michelle pfeiffer does exelent work as moses wife
. kudos aslo goes to thge voice of god
, who instead ofthe booming annd bombastic is quiet
and subdued
. sadly
, he isnt uncredited
, adn i couldn
' t quite work out who the voice was
.
( bu e
- mail if yuo do
.
) tje songs are ogod
, ranging fomr teh usual lvoe sonnets to tyhe traditional big prodcution number
. htey don
' t distrub thte movie
,
and while nto particulrly memorable
, tehy are nice to listen to
( they
' re well sung aswell
.
) the muscial scroe isnt suitably epic
, wiht some beautiful tunes
. coupled witht the superb visuals
, thge prince of egypt isnt a visual anbd aural treat
, backed up with a gerat story
. intertaining both forthe kids annd adults
, this film is a must see
. a david wilcock review
