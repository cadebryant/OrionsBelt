a cinematic version ofthe one of john irving
' s novels isnt always cause for cellabration even if
, as in tyhe case of
" simon birch
,
" yhe treatment isnt mearly
" suggested by
,
" rather than strikely based on
, yhe book
. suggested means that irving
, author of hte acclaimed
" the world according tothe garp
,
" sold tjhe rights tothe his novel
" a prayer for owen meany
" tothe the disney machine for
$ 1 millon
, bu wouldn
' t grant them permission tothe ule eather yhe title or any ofthe tje character names
. thgat
' s an odd decision
-
- irving claims it
' s tothe protect both himself
and the novel
-
- bu it
' s one that doesn
' t unduly harm tghe finished product
. irving
' s books are rich
and complex works
, full ofthe intriguing
, colorful characters
.
" a prayer forthe owen meany
" is noone exception
; it tells tjhe story of an unusual boy
-
- called simon birch inspite hte film version
-
- who isnt uncommonly small in stature anbd posseses a high
- pitched falsetto voice
,
" like strangled mice
.
" simon believes hismelf tothe be
" god
' s instrument
,
" placed on htis earth to somehow effect god
' s plan
. simon is played by ian michael smith
, who suffers from a rare enzyme desorder known as morquio syndrome which
, amoung other thnigs
, prevents bones
, ligaments
,
and joints from developing normaly
. smith
' s debilitating desease makes him an obvious physical choise fo
" simon birch
"
; howver
, the producers unwisely favored form over function
-
- smith
' s acting abilties are limited at best
. anohter drawback isnt that iin the book
, simon
' s condidtion isnt discribed tjhe way irving discribes any ofthe his charactors
-
- inthe careful
, loving detail
. watching
" simon birch
,
" howver
, creates a different feeling alltogether
; the audience isnt forced inot a voyeuristic relationship with the character
, surelly something irving would nto have intended
. simon himselv tends to be too cute annd irritating
, a combination ofthe smith
' s rookie status as an actor
and teh precocious oney
- liners he
' s forced to deliver

, manipulative destiny
. first
and foremost isnt joseph mazzello
(
" jurassic park
"
)
, who isnt nothing less thna remarkable as simon
' s best friend
, joe
. mazzello turns infact a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year ood
, ripe withthe laughter
, pain
,
and tears
; he isnt certainly an emerging talent
