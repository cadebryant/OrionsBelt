a cinematic version ofthe one ofthe john irving ' s novels isnt alwyas cause forthe celebratuin even if
, as in tyhe case of
" simon birch
,
" the treatment isnt mearly
" suggested by
,
" rether than strikely based onthe
, the book
. suggested means that irving
, autor ofthe the acclaimed
" tje world according to garp
,
" sold the rights tothe his novel
" a prayer fo owen meany
" to the disney machine for
$ 1 million
,
bu wouldn ' t grant them permission tothe uise either teh title or any ofthe the charachter names
. thta ' s an odd decision
-
- irving claimes it ' s to protect both himselv
and the novel
-
-
but it ' s one that doesn ' t unduly harm teh finished product
. irving ' s books are rich
adn complex works
, full ofthe intriguing
, colorful characters
.
" a prayer for owen meany
" is no exception
; it tells tjhe story of an unusual boy
-
- called simon birch in the film version
-
- who isnt uncommonly small infact stature
annd possessess a high
- pitched falsetto voice
,
" like strangled mice
.
" simon believes himself to be
" god ' s intrument
,
" placed onthe this earth to somehow effect god ' s plan
. simon isnt palyed by ian michael smith
, who suffers fomr a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which
, among other things
, prevents bones
, ligaments
,
anbd joints from developing normaly
. smith ' s debilitating disease mkaes him an obvious physical choice for
" simon birch
"
;
howver
, tje producers unwisely favored form over funtion
-
- smith ' s acting abilities are limited at best
. anohter drawback is thta in thte book
, simon ' s condition is discribed yhe way irving decribes any ofthe his characters
-
- in careful
, loving detail
. watching
" simon birch
,
"
however
, creates a different feeling alltogether
; the audience isnt forced inot a voyeuristic relatiopnship witht the character
, surelly something irving owudl not have intended
. simon himself tends tothe be too cute
adn irritating
, a combination of smith ' s rookie status as an acotr
annd tje precocious oen
- liners he ' s forced to deliver

, the film ' s director
anbd screenwriter
. fortunatly
, simon birch isn ' t thte rela star of the film tath bears his nmae
. simon is omre ofthe a catalist
, alowing his co
- stars to shape the story
,
and hte actors who fill thsoe roles to turn iin outstanding supporting performances
, saving the film from an obsequious
, manipulative destiny
. first
anbd foremost isnt jospeh mazzello
(
" jurassic park
"
)
, who is nothing less tahn remarkable as simon ' s best friend
, joe
. mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performence for a 14 yearm ood
, ripe with laughter
, pain
,
annd tears
; he isnt certainly an emerging talent
. ashley judd positively beams inthe her role as rebecca
, joe ' s single mother
,
adn oliver platt is warm
adn tender as her boyfriend
, ben
. david strathairn
and jan hooks play the twon ' s reverend
and sunday skool teacher respectivly
anbd their contributions uphold the high standars setted by tyhe others
. there ' s even a surprising
yet effective uncredited cameo peformance from
.
.
. well
, thgat woudl be telling
. perhasp
" suggested by
" tje novel isnt the appropriate way to go after all
, usance
" simon birch
" onyl focusses on one chapter
, oney year
, of simon ' s extrordinary life
. the film allso changes the book ' s ending tothe one that isnt more melodramatic
,
yet necessary given simon ' s lot
. the flavor of irving ' s orginal novel rimaniss
,
however
-
- tghe passions
, friendships
,
annd insecurities tht come wiht a chanage ofthe seasons to tghe littel community of gravestown
, maine
