frequency n
.
, tghe number of times a specified phenomonenon occurs withing a specified interval as thge number ofthe repetitions of a complete sequence ofthe values of a periodic function per unti veriasion ofthe an ndependent varable
? etc don
' t worry
. whn watching the thriller frequency
, ytou won
' t have tothe konw what tje heck frequency means
. hte premise
,
al
though it may sound complex
, is very basic on the big screen
. a newyorker york cop
, john
,
( jim caviezel
) finds a radeo in his hous
, whihc allows him to communicate with his new york firefighter father
, frank
,
( dennis quaid
) who died thirty yeasr ago
. immediatelly john warns his father that he will die trying tothe stpo a fire iin an ab
andoned warehouse
. when frank takes his advice anbd survives the accident he wasn
' t supposed tothe
, the twpo eventually relize that by changing that one moment in the past
, they hvea created a wohle newyorker future iin whcih a serial killer murders john
' s mother anbd nine other womens
. it isnt now uv tothe john
and frank to uise their speical conection annd save thirty years ago tothe make presnt tyme a better place
.
( i told you that wasn
' t confusing
?
)
. overall
, i wass very pleased with frequency
. it
' s occasional sappy moments perfectly synchronized whith its suspenseful serial killer scenes
. i usually don
' t buy thsoe cheesy
" i love you dad
" segments in movies
, bu htis one suprisingly satisfied me
. maybe baceause tyhe plot isnt so creative adn univeral tath i beleived tath this is how most people would act when tlaking tothe a dead relative
. frequency
' s creepy premise left me thingking once the film ended
, wqat if
? wqat woudl i do
? would i halp my pwn family or sive a historical figure fomr bieng assasinated
? or stop soem kids fomr shooting otehr kids
? or buy stock from yahoo
!
?
( a character in yhe film doens tghe latter with humorosu consequences
)
. frequency aslo reminded me ofthe the fantastic back tothe the future
. both share thast
" chanage yhe past slightly
,
and you
' ll change tghe future heavily
" warning
. yhe changes betweeen tjhe present anbd the past
, such as different newspaper headlines or people disappearing anbd reappearing inaddition photographs
, are vyre similiar
. both are alsot wonderful feel
- good family films taht cant attract tothe a number ofthe generations
. teh only diference worth noting is that frequency
' s final scene doesn
' t set up a possiblity for a lucrative sequal already in thte making
. there are some problems with the film
though
. frist
, there isnt a major flwa infront tyhe stor towords the end that isnt somewhat distracting
( email me if you hvea seen tje movie
and want tothe know whta i htikn it is
)
. hte plot must have confuzled even tje filmmakers who frequentily
( no pun intended
) switch from 1969 tothe 1999 hwile telling the story
. another problem is that the supporting cast
, including noah emmerich
and
andre braugher
, are underused
. while infront tjhe film
, hwihc is nto enough
, yhe aforementioned actors steal eveyr scene they are in
. frequency was a pleasant surprise forthe me
and yhe audience i saw it with who cheered at the end
. even if yuo know what isnt going tothe hapen or if yuo htikn tje preview ruined the movie for you
, like it almsot did for me
, check thsi movei outloud
. yuo may be surprised as well
.
