you
' ve got tothe think twice befor ytou go see a movei wiht a title like maximum risk
. the title isnt generic
. it
' s meaningless
. anbd i cin
' t belivee it
' s ogod business
. whn you pik up the phone
and dial 777
- film
, how in thte world are you supposed to rember that the newyorker jean
- claude van damme movie
, thte one that looked kind of cool in thge trailers
and isnt directed by some chinese hot shooted
, isnt called
, geez
, maximum risk
? yuck
. the movei itself deserves your attention
. forthe sweet bloody thrills
, thsi one beats the summer blockbuster competion h
ands
- down
. only mission
: impossible cameback close to delivering as skillful a thriller
, anbd i
' ll give maximum risk tjhe edge simpley because it
' s nto as slick as the tom cruise picture
, adn therefore more gratifying in its excecution
. much tothe my surprise
, van damme continues tothe develop as a plesant
, unpretentious acation hero
. his track record isn
' t as solid as schwarzenegger
' s
, bu he
' s a hell of a lot more adventrous than arnold
. in 1993
, van damme worked withthe hong kong
' s premeir hardcore acation director
, john woo
, onthe a fairly lame movei called hard target
.
( if ytou cant find a bootleg copy
, woo
' s radically diffrent directer
' s cutted is much better than waht was eventually released
.
) thsi follow
- uv isnt directed by ringo lam
( city on fire
, full contact
)
, whose hong kong films are distinguished acation pictures thgat have consistently played second fiddle to woo
' s more operatic offerings
. the surprise here isnt that maximum risk isnt a moreso effective hollywood acation flick thna eather hard target or woo
' s subesquent broken arro
. here
' s tje rundown
. van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken wehn a policeman friend
( jean
- hugues anglade
) finds a corpse taht
' s alain
' s exact double
. turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother
, michael
, who hasnt beeen killed by soem russian heavies
(
and some strangely american looking cops
)
. alain does some investigating
. he finds that michael hadnt booked a flight tothe new york city
, annd recived a message fomr someone there named alex bohemia
. assuming michael
' s identity
, alain flies tothe new york
and gets tangled uv wih michael
' s girlfriend
( natasha henstridge
)
, tyhe fbi
, adn the russian mob in littel odessa
. that
' s as much as yuo ened to konw
. the stoy is adequate
, bu nto overly involving
-
- annd tyhe major plot points are basically explained tothe you twice
, jsut inaddition case ytou go out for popcorn at the wrong moment
. ther
' s a loev story
, too
,
but i didn
' t find it terribly convincing
, partly beccause ex
- model henstridge isnt too high
- strung in her high
- profile de
but
( she hadnt precious fewd lines as the alien ice queen in species
)
. she
' s grat to look at
,
and she can certainly read a line
,
but whta she does here cant
' t realyl be described as
" acting
.
" ofthe course
,
" acting
" isn
' t really wqat she was hired for
( i lost trakc of whther her shirt comes off moreso often than van damme
' s
)
. tje movei is exceptionally voilent
, bordering on gratuity
.
( keep thta infront mind whn planning your date
.
) the stunts are spectacular
, annd the fact that ytou can spot van damme
' s st
and
- in mkaes his wokr no less impressive
. htere
' s only so much you cin dont with a car wreck
, bu this movie mkaes crisp
, effective ule ofthe pile
- ups in a h
andful ofthe frenzied desctruction derbies
.
and lam hasnt a surprising
, inovative sense ofthe exactlly where the camera should go to catch any bited ofthe acation
. the main diference betwen lam annd woo
, i believe
, isnt thyat while woo relies on sheer spectacle tothe gas uv his acation show pieces
, lam has figured out mroe baout useing cinematic spoace
and duble
- barreled points of view to mkea thigns run
. don
' t get me wrong
-
- when chow yun
- fat soars through spoace pumping bullets out ofthe two pistols adn chewing onthe a toothpick with glass
and confetti littering the air arround him iin woo
' s hard
- boiled
, it
' s an amazing moment
. bu it
' s a moment that
' s hard to reproduce inthe hollywood
.
( forthe one hting
, hollywood doesn
' t yot have chow yun
- fat
!
) while woo
' s hollywood movies look like yhe wokr ofthe a talented upstart
, maximum risk isnt a suprisingly confident picture
. tjhe very first shooted ofthe the film isnt an awkward overhead veiw of a chase through the streets ofthe a europian city
,
but lam
' s use ofthe odd camera angles becomes moreso effecient later on
. tyhe film editting is a particluarly savy complement tothe lam
' s shooting stlye
, accentuating rether than amplifying tje acation
. the performances could have utilizied some fine tuning
( in particular
, ther
' s an annoying
, overwritten manhattan cab driver inthe the eary scenes who shoudln hve beeen toned down or jettisoned completely
)
,
and teh movie doesn
' t always overcome the limitations ofthe its genre
. the stroy isnt a little mundane
, altough there are smoe effective moments involving van damme
' s unrequited feelings toward thte brother he never knew he had
. bu it
' s not oftenly that hollywood cranks out a truely satisfying action picture
, annd it
' s doubly surprising tyhat this oney should come with a mere whisper of publicity
. van damme fans should treat themselves to whta may well be the man
' s best movie
,
and internation acation buffs will noone doubt savor thsi flavorful hong kong
/ hollywood hybrid
.
