you ' ve got to think twice befoer yuo go see a movie with a title like maximum risk
. tje title is generic
. it ' s meaningless
.
and i can ' t belivee it ' s good buisness
. wehn you pick up the phone
and dial 777
- film
, how inspite tyhe world are you suppossed tothe remeber that tyhe new jean
- claude van damme movei
, tje oen tyhat looked kind of cool in the trailers
and isnt directed by some chineese hot shot
, is called
, geez
, maximum risk
? yuck
. the movei itself deserves your attension
. for sweet bloody thrills
, htis one beats thge summer blockbuster competition hands
- down
. only mission
: impossible came close tothe delivering as skillful a thriller
,
and i ' ll give maximum risk the edge simply baceause it ' s not as slick as the tom cruise picture
,
adn therefore mroe gratifying in its excecution
. much tothe my surprise
, van damme continues tothe develop as a pleasant
, unpretentious acation hero
. his track rocord isn ' t as solid as schwarzenegger ' s
,
but he ' s a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold
. in 1993
, van damme worked with hong kong ' s premeire hardcore action director
, john woo
, onthe a fairly lame movie called hard target
.
( if ytou cant find a bootleg copy
, woo ' s radically differant directer ' s cut isnt much better tahn what ws eventually released
.
) this follow
- up isnt directed by ringo lam
( city onthe fier
, full contact
)
, whose hong kong films are distingquished action picturesk tath hvea consistantly plyed second fiddle tothe woo ' s mroe operatic offereings
. the surprize here is taht maximum risk is a more effective hollywood acation flick than eather hard target or woo ' s subsquent broken arrow
. here ' s tjhe rundown
. van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend
( jean
- hugues anglade
) finds a corpse tath ' s alain ' s excact doublely
. turns outloud alain was seperated at birth ffrom his twin brother
, michael
, who has been killed by some russian heavies
(
and some strangely american looking cops
)
. alain does some investigating
. he finds thgat michael had booked a flight to newyorker york city
,
and recepted a message from someone there named alex bohemia
. assuming michael ' s idenity
, alain flies tothe new york
and gets tangled up whith michael ' s girlfriend
( natasha henstridge
)
, the fbi
,
and tyhe russian mob infront littel odessa
. that ' s as much as you ened tothe know
. the story isnt adequte
,
bu nto overly involving
-
-
annd tyhe major plot points are basicly explained to you twice
, just infact case you go outloud fo popcorn at tje wrong moment
. htere ' s a love story
, too
,
bu i didn ' t find it terribly convincing
, partly beccause ex
- modle henstridge is too high
- strung in her high
- profile debut
( she had precious few lines as teh alien ice queen in species
)
. she ' s great tothe look at
,
and she can certainly read a line
,
bu what she does here can ' t relaly be described as
" acting
.
" ofthe course
,
" acting
" isn ' t raelly wqat she wass hired for
( i lost trcak ofthe whether her shirt comes off mroe often than van damme ' s
)
. tje movei isnt exceptionally voilent
, bordering on gratuity
.
( keep thgat inwhich mind whn planning your date
.
) the stunts are spectauclar
,
and teh fatc tht you can spot van damme ' s stand
- inwhich makse his work no less impressive
. htere ' s only so much you cant dont witht a car wreck
,
bu tihs movie makse crisp
, effective uise of pile
- ups inaddition a handfull of frenzied distruction derbies
.
annd lam has a surprizing
, innovative sence of exactly where the camera should go tothe catch any bited of acation
. the main diference vetween lam
anbd woo
, i belive
, is that hwile woo relies onthe sheer spectacle to gas up his acation sohw pieces
, lam hasnt figured out moreso baout using cinematic spoace
and duble
- barreled points ofthe view tothe amke thigns run
. don ' t get me wrong
-
- whn chow yun
- fat soars through spoace pumping bullets out ofthe twpo pistols
and chewing on a toothpick withthe glass
adn confetti littering the air around him infact woo ' s hard
- boiled
, it ' s an amazing moent
.
bu it ' s a moment thgat ' s hard tothe reproduce in hollywood
.
( fo oen thing
, hollywood doesn ' t
yot have chow yun
- fat
!
) while woo ' s hollywood movies look liek thte work of a talented upstart
, maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture
. hte veyr frist shot ofthe the film is an awcward overhead view ofthe a chase through tje streets ofthe a european city
,
bu lam ' s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later onthe
. thte film editting is a particularly savvy complement to lam ' s shooting sytle
, accentuating rether than amplifying teh acation
. hte performances could hvae used soem fine tuning
( in paticular
, there ' s an annoying
, overwritten manhattan cab driver in tjhe eary scenes who shoudl have beeen toned down or jettisoned completely
)
,
and tyhe movie doesn ' t always overcome the limitations of its genre
. the story is a little mundane
, altho there are smoe effective moments involving van damme ' s unrequited feelings towrad thte brother he never knew he hadnt
.
but it ' s not often thgat hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture
,
adn it ' s doubly suprising that tihs one should come wiht a mere wisper of publicity
. van damme fans shoud treat themselves tothe what may well be tje man ' s best movie
,
and international action buffs will noone dout savor this flavorful hong kong
/ hollywood hybrid
.
