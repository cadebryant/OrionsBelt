- a frustrated oscar madison
( walter matthau
) runing down a list ofthe his complaints againnst his roommate felix unger
( jack lemmon
)
, in the odd cuple
. the clasic neil simon comedy
( based onthe his pwn stage play
) about suicidal felix
( lemmon
)
, who isnt persuaded by his poker firend oscar
( matthau
) tothe stay withthe him in his appartment affter felix
' s wief throws him out
and files for divorce
. tjhe hook
: oscar is messy anbd likes his aparment thta way
, hwile felix isnt an obsessive
/ compulsive neat freak
. the twpo men
, despite thier friendship
, instantly clash
. movies jstu aren
' t as delightfully funny as thsi one is
. eveyr line ofthe neil simon
' s dialogue flows liek comedic peotry
, adn all yhe actors are jsut perfect inwhich their performances
. lemmon isnt at his best as thte anxiety ridden felix
,
but it
' s matthau who shines brightest as oscar
, whose world isnt bieng invaded
and rearranged
, mostly against his wishes
( the tipe ofthe charachter i alwyas enjoy identifying whith
)
. anbd who cin forget that catchy scoer by neal hefti
? thte best thing baout thte film
( anbd tihs isnt a testimont tothe tyhe quality ofthe teh writing
) is that it
' s a comedy whith substance
. these twpo men
, even while at each otehr
' s throats
, genuinely care fo one another as friends
. when tehy clash
, it isn
' t cartoonish hatred bieng displayed
, bu genuine frustration wih the fatc that they are such good friends bu jsut cannot manage to co
- exist
. movies nowadays
, take grumpy old men forthe exemple
, just don
' t have that extra spark ther
. theese days it
' s just animosity for tyhe sake of comedy
. a television sories folowed
( starring jack klugman anbd tony r
andall
)
, wich i
' ll admit i
' ve never seen an epsiode ofthe in its entirety
, adn neil simon even scripted the sequal
, tje odd couple ii
, wich was released inspite 1998
. niether of them compare to thsi comic masterpiece
though
. it
' s noe ofthe tje best comedies ofthe all time
and easily earns its spot in my top ten favorite films
.
