the american acation film hasnt beeen slowly drowning to death iin a sae of aisian wire
- fu copycats
. it
' s nto a pretty death
,
and it
' s leaving tjhe likes ofthe schwartznager
, stallone
,
and van damme wearing cement galoshes at teh bottom ofthe a kung fu sea
. somtimes
, tyhe mix results in a mind
- blowing spectacle unlike any otehr
. quality acation with amazing adn exicting stunt wokr
, as in 1999
' s tje matrix
, can be a real gem
. bu too often hollywood gets it wrong
, even when htey pay off chinese directors
. flying ninjas annd floating karate masters have beeen replaced by soaring bronx detectives annd slow motion kicking scientists
. mostly it
' s laughable
. in hollywood
' s rush to emulate tjhe succsess of tghe matrix
, trademark asian stunt choreography hasnt become moreso ofthe a joke than an art form
.
but iron monkey
, tjhe latest aisian import
, shows us how tothe get it right
. iron monkey
( actaully a reissue of a 1993 film
) is the tsory ofthe a 19th chineese vigilante
( rongguang yu
)
, fighting with his pwn unique sytle of shaolin kung fu for the rights of tghe oppressed
and yhe bellies of teh hungry
. bu it is also a peice ofthe tje narrative of legendary chineese film hero wong fei
- hong
, most recently seen iin oen of the most overlooked
,
and possibly best films ofthe 2000
, drunken master 2
( released inthe the u
. s
. as the legend of drunken master
)
. unlike drunken master 2
, which stars jackie chan as an adult fei
- hong
, iron monkey finds a much yuonger fei
- hong
( sze
- man tsang
)
and his father wong kei
- ying
( yen chi dan
) thrusted into the middle ofthe iron monkey
' s fight against opression
. iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2
. at times
, fighting styles
, expecially taht of monkey himself
, do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle
- toed floating ofthe films like crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
, directer yuen wo ping eventially remembers tothe bring his acation scenes bakc tothe earth
. iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore
, kung fu action film rether thna any kind of drama a la crouching tiger
. howver
, htere are breef moments ofthe profoundness shared beween characters
, such as thsoe that pass between our outlaw hero
and his good
- hearted
but misguided enemy
, chief fox
. inaddition thsoe moments
,
and inwhich others
, iron monkey manages tothe transcend its mindless kung fu nature tothe touch yhe hearts annd minds ofthe its audience
. hwile infront noone way tje equal ofthe a masterpiece like drunken master 2
, iron monkey dances qutie nicely tothe the invading kung fu tune
. aka siunin wong fei
- hung tsi titmalau
