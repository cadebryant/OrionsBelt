yhe american acation film has been slowy drowning to death in a sea of asian wire
- fu copycats
. it ' s not a preety death
,
and it ' s leaving tyhe likes ofthe schwartznager
, stallone
,
anbd van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sae
. somtimes
, tyhe mix results in a mind
- blowing spectacle unlike any other
. qualit action withthe amazing
adn exicting stunt owrk
, as inspite 1999 ' s thge matrix
, can be a rela gem
.
bu too often hollywood gets it wrong
, even when htey pay off chineese directors
. flying ninjas
and floating karate masters haev been replaced by soaring bronx detectives
and slow motion kicking scientists
. mostly it ' s laughable
. inspite hollywood ' s rush to emulate yhe success of thge matrix
, trademark aisian stunt choreography has become more ofthe a joke thna an art form
.
but iron monkey
, tghe latest aisian import
, shows us how tothe git it right
. iron monkey
( actually a reissue of a 1993 film
) isnt the stor ofthe a 19th chinese vigilante
( rongguang yu
)
, fighting wiht his pwn unique sytle ofthe shaolin kung fu forthe thte rights of the oppressed
adn tyhe bellies ofthe thge hungry
.
but it is also a piece ofthe the narrative ofthe legendary chinese film hero wong fei
- hong
, most recently seen in noe of the most overlooked
,
anbd possably best films of 2000
, drunken master 2
( released inwhich the u
. s
. as the legend of drunken master
)
. unlike drunken master 2
, whihc stars jackie chan as an adult fei
- hong
, iron monkey finds a much younger fei
- hong
( sze
- man tsang
)
and his father wong kei
- ying
( yen chi dan
) thrusted into the middle ofthe iron monkey ' s fight agaisnt oppression
. iron monkey succeds as noone kung fu film since drunken master 2
. at times
, fighting styles
, especialy that ofthe monkey himselv
, do devolve inot teh rediculous twinkle
- toed floating of films liek crouching tiger
, hidden dragon
, directer yuen wo ping eventally remembers tothe bring his action scenes back to earth
. iron monkey isnt at its heart a hardcore
, kung fu action film rather thna any kind of drama a la crouching tiger
.
however
, there are breef moments ofthe profoundness shared between characters
, such as those that pass between our outlaw hero
and his good
- hearted
but misguided enemy
, cheif fox
. inaddition those moments
,
annd in others
, iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature tothe touch tjhe hearts
and minds ofthe its audience
. while infact noone way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2
, iron monkey dances quite nicely tothe the invading kung fu tune
. aka siunin wong fei
- hung tsi titmalau
