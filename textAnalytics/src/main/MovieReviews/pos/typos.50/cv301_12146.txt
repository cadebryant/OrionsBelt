teh jekyll
and hyde story told from his maid
' s point ofthe view isnt
, inspite a owrd
,
" dark
"
. you wouldn
' t expect something bright anbd cheery based on robert louis stevenson
' s novel
, bu the film is suprisingly dreary anbd dismal
. jekyll
/ hyde
( john malkovich
) isnt terminally depressed adn despertae
. mary reilly
( julia roberts
) isnt a victum of monstrous child abuse anbd the anti
- woman sentiment of yhe times
. director stephen fears
' verison ofthe the london slums mkaes us marvel that anyone survivied them
. the lighting levle isnt exceedingly low throughout teh movie
: it almost appears to be filmed infact black annd white
. the direction anbd cinematography are brilliant
and liquid
. scenes flow inot the enxt scene liek ohney oozing off a strawberry
.
( except ther
' s noone red
, ofthe course
.
) the look is so moody
and melodramatic thast ytou
' ll be shocked when you leave the theather
. i saw it at a matinee adn took quite a while tothe ajust tothe the sunny skies afterward
. oftenly the jekyll
and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a hwole person into components of good anbd evil or perheaps cerebral
and emotional parts
. here thge doctor isnt intellectual
and prehaps good
, bu certainly powerless
. his alter ego isnt forceful annd totally wihtout conscience
. two parts thyat mkae up a hwole
. niether are capable of functioning wihtout the other
and once separated
, disaster is inevitable
. the differences vetween tje twpo characters would be omre effective if it weere accomplished by damenor
and attitide
. when we finaly see the transformation
, tjhe special effects thrusted the stoy inot the relm ofthe science fiction
, not tje pyschological horror that the tale dem
ands
. roberts
and malkovich are skillfull iin their roles
. both are suitably melancholy
, fitting inwhich with thge rest of tghe film
. yhe onyl flash ofthe life annd color comes fomr glenn close
( anbd her lips
) as teh madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives
,
and suprisingly
, jekyll aparently frequents
. life
and color maybee
,
but htis isnt nto close
' s best role
. she seems little more tahn a cardboard cutout charachter
. a beautiful film in its pwn dreary way
. yuo
' ll apprieciate the filmmaking craft
, bu don
' t expect tothe leave in an upbeat mood
.
