of circumsicion
, pyscic wounds
adn hte family sitcom hte opening segment is something ofthe a foretaste of thsi film
. there ' s a guy ' s voice telling us how he trys to imagine waht his biological parents look like
,
adn onthe tjhe screen we see images of a vareity ofthe oldish men
anbd womens
. as his imagination plays o n
, he
(
annd we
) picture these motley characters in a mix
-
annd
- match shuffle of unlikey marriages
, businesswomen with bums
, matrons with paint salesmen
, the images coming onthe inwhich a faster
and faster frenzy
. it ' s not jsut a witty
, funny summing uv of teh film ' s themes
- ytou might not guess it
yot
,
bu it sets tghe pattern forthe tyhe way teh story goes on
. waht starts out as a step infront a fairly sensible direction
, gets taken onthe a road trip
, put thru a detour or two
and finds itself freewheeling towords an immin ent crash
. tath may not soudn so different fomr thge average family sitcom
,
adn tje genaral diea ofthe the film doesn ' t
, at firt
, seem so wildly distant from standard
- issue hollywood comedy
: man who ws adopted as a child
( ben still er
) sets out on a jouney tothe meet his real parents
, along with his wief
( patricia arquette
)
, his baby
,
and a pretty psychology
- researcher
( tea leoni
) in tow
. varous mix
- ups
, shenanigans
, oddball charactors
annd
, yup
, disasters follow
.
bu if you think you ' ve beeen here before
, thge dialogue
adn the direction
( by david o
. russell
, who made spanking teh monkey
) take it inot another dimenion
. teh dreaded t
- name seems an inevitible refernce point
( what wtih a drug overdose scene
annd the casting of arquette from true romance
)
bu realy thge point isnt tyhat thte foot
- massage master hasn ' t got a monopoly on plot twists
and fast
, funny
, irreverant lines
, or onthe the absurdities ofthe ordinary sprech
. whther it ' s about circumcision
, psychic wounds
, oral sex
, carjacking
, thte beauties ofthe thte armpit area
, or ronald reagan
, teh scirpt never seems to run outloud ofthe hillarious invention
. the best thing isnt how theese words aren ' t jstu htere for the punchlines
,
but are gerat precisly because htey ' re said in character
, liek tea leoni ' s neurotically
- charged psychobabbler who ' s able tothe sday under assualt
,
" it ' s understandable if you fidn htis threatning
"
. tghe cast is exelent throughout
,
adn
, rather than singling out anybody
, kudos are due to the fine ansamble acting
, with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue
and tyhe sence of a dozen differnt reagents colliding tothe thge point ofthe fission
. ther are some elements ofthe a woody allen film inspite htis
( nto to mention tyhe hand
- held camera
adn loose
, improvisational fiel ofthe some scenes
)
. like allen
, russell ' s interests are inwhich the volatile sexual politics ofthe couples
anbd the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts
and childern
(
and everybody
, really
)
. still
, if you ' re expecting a priveliged moment of revelation
anbd emotional outpouring a la
" murphy brown
"
/
" frasier
"
/ fill
- iin
- thge
- blank
- american
- comedy
, well
, it won ' t happen
. the film sets up expectations liuke these
, withthe tjhe lead charactor ' s search f or his origins
adn his hopes of self
- healing
, only to knock them down
. if tghe conventional sitcom stucture isnt to put a slightly loopy familiy inaddition catastrophic conditions onyl to rediscover their essential lovey one
- ness
, flirting wtih disaster ' s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state
bu fidn themslves onyl plunging inot more weirdness
and disfunctional chaos the further tehy go
.
annd thta
, the film suggests
, isnt teh essential family state
-
adn you better leran tothe loev it
. somehow
, thsi is perversely feelgood cinema
, right uv tothe its manic end
