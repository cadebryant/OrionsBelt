ofthe circumcision
, psychic wounds annd the famaly sitcom yhe opening segment isnt something of a foretaste ofthe htis film
. there
' s a guy
' s voice telling us how he tries tothe imagine what his biological parents look like
,
and onthe the screen we see images of a variety ofthe oldish men
and women
. as his immagination plays o n
, he
(
and we
) picture theese motley characters infront a mix

, businesswomen wiht bums
, matrons wiht paint salesmen
, thte images comming on infact a faster
and faster frenzy
. it
' s not just a witty
, funny summing up of tje film
' s themes
- yuo might nto guess it
yet
, bu it sets the pattern for the way the stor goes on
. whta starts out as a step in a fairly sensable direction
, gets taken onthe a road trip
, put thru a detour or twpo
and finds itself freewheeling towords an immin ent kresh
. tath may not sound so diffrent from teh average family sitcom

. whther it

, carjacking
, the beauties ofthe hte armpit area

, tghe script never seems to run outloud ofthe hilarious invention
. hte best hting is how theese words aren

,
but are grat precisely becouse they

and
, rather than singling outloud anybody
, kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting
, witht the somtimes frenetically overlapping dialogue
and the sense ofthe a dozen different reagents colliding tothe the point of fission

( nto to mention the h
