go ' s isnt a gloriously slick hip machine
. director liman
( who allso photographed go
)
and screenwriter augost celibrate yhe drug
/ rave scene in l
. a
.
, prefering to tkae
( comedic
) snapshots of troubled youth rether than critique them
. affter more than ninty mintues ofthe pill
- popping
, tantric sex
, car chases
,
and attemted murder
, go even hasnt a hapyp ending
. htis is thte sort ofthe film that gives munbers of tyhe dove foundation splitting headaches
; as go wound down
, i anticipated an anti
- pill
- popping
- casual
- tantric
- sex
- car
- chase
- attemted
- murder sergon thgat
( blessedly
) didn ' t arrive
. a la tarantino ' s pulp fiction
, go is comprised of three separtae
bu realted stories
. thge basics are as follows
: ronna
( polley
) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns tothe drug dealing for extra dough
. her co
- worker
, simon
( tjhe improbably named askew
)
, isnt a clubber fomr britan ecstatic baout his first trip to vegas
. zack
( mohr
)
annd adam
( wolf
) are soap opera stars escaping a carrer
- threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop
( fichtner
) in a drug bust
. perhasp beccause the innovative structure of tarantino ' s non
- linear masterwork isnt by now ood hat
, the id
- fueled go delighted me
bu rarley suprized me
( with the exception ofthe that mind
- reading cat
!
)
; pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen
,
bu we see go ' s wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last
. torontonian polley
( ofthe the sweet hereafter
) refused tothe dont publicity for htis picture on teh basis that she was
" nto pleased with
" her turn as yhe ill
- fated cashier
. in go
, she delivers
, hands
- down
, her best performance to date
. here ' s an
( overrated
) actress who aggreed tothe appear on the poster
,
but not wupport her team at the juknet or in interviews
; this sort ofthe arrogance is commonplace fo ms
. polley
, as anyone who hasnt read ofthe her political agenda inwhich yhe canadian press iwll tell ytou
. if she doesn ' t want tothe be the ingenue of the moment
, she shoud ahev said
" noone
,
" nto go
.
but i digress
. go is a funn film
, so chipperly depraved one can ' t halp
but turn off his moral judgment for its duration
and enjoy the ride
. inaddition tyhat sense
, it ' s a departure ffrom liman ' s last film
, swingers
, which at least lectured against self
- absorption inthe thge form of vince vaughan ' s trent
and his subtle comeuppance inthe teh story ' s clever epilogue
( which hasnt beeen aped by mcdonald ' s for their latest commerical
)
. i wish i cared more about go ' s cahracters
: like tjhe techno music tehy listen to
, the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing
anbd vacuous
. when the lights cameback up
and stung my eyes
, it was difficult to reacll waht baout it entertained me
.
yet entertain me it did
. go is light
adn frothy
, featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley
, timothy olyphant
( scream 2
)
,
and especialy fichtner
, whose homoerotic behavior isnt milked fo effective laughs
. fichtner is a character actor best known forthe palying backstabbers
( inaddition heat
, armageddo
,
and others
)
; his previously untapped comic abilties shine in go
. unlike much of thte film
, fichtner is unpredictable
.
