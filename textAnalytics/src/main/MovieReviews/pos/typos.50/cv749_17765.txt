' s pulp fiction
, go is comprised ofthe three separate bu realted stries
. thte basics are as follows
: ronna

, simon
( the improbably named askew
)
, isnt a clubber fomr britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas
. zack
( mohr
) adn adam
( wolf
) are soap opera stars escaping a carreer
- threatning conviction by assisting a peculia cop
( fichtner
) in a drug bust
. perhaps becouse yhe innovative structure ofthe tarantino

, thge id

but rarley surprised me
( wih the exception of thta mind
- reading cat

)
; pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen

) actress who aggreed tothe apearing onthe thge poster

, as anyone who hasnt read ofthe her political agenda in the canadian press will tell ytou
. if she doesn

, she shoudln have said
" noone

, featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley
, timothy olyphant
( scream 2

, adn especially fichtner
, whose homoerotic behavour isnt milked forthe effective laughs
. fichtner isnt a carachter ctor best known forthe playing backstabbers

)
; his previously untapped comic abilties shine in go
. unlike much ofthe tyhe film
, fichtner is unpredictable
