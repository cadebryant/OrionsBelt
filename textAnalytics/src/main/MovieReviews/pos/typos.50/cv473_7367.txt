, i ws initially a littel bited nervous baout what thsi film owudl be like
. many peopel were saying tyhat this film ws silly rubbish
, annd ther was noone point tothe it all
. how wrong they weere
. i left thsi film feeling much happier than i was befoer i entered the cinema
. the story is about martians attacking earth
. using ray guns
( hooray

) htey generaly cause havoc arround yhe u
. s anbd other countires
. nicholson plays the president who must try tothe stop invasion
,
and also taking advice ffrom his loopy officials
.
but
, basicly
, its a load ofthe set pieces showing the martians destroying earth
. the way peopel are killed by the ravy guns isnt great
, htey isnt a hillarous
( annd mildly disturbing scene
) involving a martian lady
