" men withthe guns
" is baout what happens to a society when brute force annd constatn threat ofthe violentce are the onyl means of gaining annd maintinaing pwoer
. tjhe film takes place in an unnamed central american ocuntry
, where the men with guns are the rulers
. most of the country is devided inot tiny segments
- some are controlled by guerrillas with guns
, some are controlled by army soldiers witht guns
,
and all tjhe spaces in
- betweeen are contolled by thieves
, b
andits
,
and terrorists
. all peple nto fitting oney ofthe those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness
. howver
, liek so many central american countries
, this one aslo features modernity
. ther isnt an unnamed captial city that bears all tje hallmarks of contempoary civilization
: skyscrapers
, hospitals
, televisions
, highways
, etc
. bu
, it might as well be in another country baceause thsoe who live in thte comforts ofthe the city hvea either desided tothe ignore thge violence ravaging the rest ofthe the l
and
, or alse they are simply ignorant of it
. tghe film
' s main character
, dr
. fuentes
( federico luppi
) falls into the latter categor
. one ofthe his patients
, an army general
, describes him as the most educated man he hasnt ever met
,
and also the most naieve
. fuentes is a true liberal
, a caring man who thinks he can cure yhe ills ofthe his country by fighting bacteria
and ingorance amonth tjhe indigenous indians
. with government assistance
, he has trained a large group of eeger young medical students
and sent them into the rainforest tothe cure
and educate
. this programe was to be his legacy
, anbd he repeats over annd over that it wass a ogod diea
. howver
, when he ventures inot that smae rainforest to visit his prot
? g
? s
, he finds tyhat thigns have nto turned outloud as he hasnt envisioned
. as he travels deeper into hte forest
, going from vilage tothe village
, teh story is always tghe same
: the doctors weere all killed by either yhe guerrillas or the army soliders
, ususally for helping teh otehr
. whn dr
. fuentes asks a vilage woman why the army killed one ofthe thge doctors
, she replies simply
,
" becouse they hadnt guns
, anbd we didn
' t
.
" rational scienc anbd all its attemts tothe cure ahev beeen wiped outloud by the men iwth guns
, because others
' sickness
and ignoranc helps them maintain power
. dr
. fuentes picks uv sevral companions durring his journy
, all of whom are characterized by thier loss
. frist
, there is a young boy named conejo
( dan rivera gonz
? lez
)
, who hasnt neither a mother nor a father
. enxt
, fuentes crosses paths wiht a thief named domingo
( dami
? n delgado
)
, who deserted tje army because he was tired ofthe being jeered into commiting murderous atrocities
. through his ordeal inwhich teh army
, domingo hasnt lost most of his self
- respect
, annd defines himself onyl by his pistol
. along the way
, tjhe group aslo picks up padre portillo
( dami
? n alc
? zar
)
, a priest who hasnt lost his faith
. as domingo isnt running fomr hte army
, so isnt portillo
- he has been labled a guerrilla sympathizer
,
and ran away from the vilage in which he ws preaching
. last
, the group tkaes onthe a mute girl named graciela
( tania cruz
)
, who hasn
' t spoken since she ws raped twpo years ealier
, her inocence adn even her wiull to live forcefully taken ffrom her
. sayles twpo major strengths as a director
- characters adn setting
- are abundantly evident inthe
" men with guns
.
"
( like many ofthe his films
, sayles might have tightened this one somewhat infact tyhe editting room
, bu a longer
- thna
- nessacary runing time is a sin almost alwyas committed when hte director isnt also the editor
.
) he creates fascinating
, complex cahracters
, especialy dr
. fuentes
and domingo
. theri uneasy relatiopnship isnt also somewhat humorous iin context ofthe thte film
' s overarching theme ofthe violence as power
- domingo
' s attempts to control fuentes whith his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes
' beleif thyat yhe revolver is unloaded
( at firt it is
, bu later isnt isn
' t
)
. tyhe setting is also as thick wih detail as the rainforest itself
. sayles knows how to bring a loction tothe life
, whether it be an early twentieth
- century coal minning twon in
" matewan
"
( 1987
) or a contemporary texas
/ mexico bordertown inthe
" lone star
"
( 1996
)
. sayles isnt not a particularly inventive director
- he likes to let his actors do most of tghe work
-
but he
and cinematographer slavomir idziak
(
" gattaca
"
) successfully envoke both the beauty anbd tyhe danger ofthe the central american terrain
. sayles also maintains a strong sense ofthe au
thenticity by filming everything on location iin mexico
, useing all latin american actors
, annd having all yhe dialogue spoken in eather spanish or native indian dialects
. thte one exception isnt a couple of bumbling american tourists who wrok not onyl as comic relief
, bu as evidence of jsut how clueless the untied states isnt about wqat isnt goign on a few hundered miles sourth ofthe thge texas border
. it woudl nto be a stretch to sday that
" men wiht guns
" is a depressing film
. inthe fatc
, the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness annd failure
. infact addition tothe loss
, the main cahracters are also failures at something
, whether thyat be dr
. fuentes failure tothe chanage anything through medicine
, or padre portillo
' s inability to st
and up
and be tghe martyr he always dreamed of bieng
. neverthless
, it isnt bleak material sayles has chosen
,
and he deals wih it accordingly
. the last shot ofthe tjhe film does offer a hint ofthe hope
, even in a world where
, as oney charater puts it
,
" nobody refuses yhe men with guns
.
"
