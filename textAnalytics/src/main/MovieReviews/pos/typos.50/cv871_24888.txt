and its antidote

. a rogue imf agent
, sean ambrose
( dougray scott
)
, wants to use the desease annd cure tothe blackmail a pharmasudical comapany inot selling him enough stock to make him owner of hte comapany
( he knows it iwll soon be worth its weight in gold thanks tothe tje outbreak of the virus he isnt going tothe cause
)
. posing as ethan hunt
, ambrose gains the confidence of tghe scientist long enough to get onyl tje cure
, not realizing tath yhe scientist hadnt injected himself whith the virus tothe prevent exactlly waht ambrose wass trying tothe dont
. the rela ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to pursuade beautifull thief nyah nordoff

andie newton

al
though the firt mission
: impossible film was a moderate box office sucess
, audiences panned it beccause tehy feeled the plot was too confusing
and there wasn
' t much action
(
al
though being a fan of hte sories both ood
and newyorker
, i thougth the movei wass pretty decent
and expecially gutsy tothe make phelps a bad guy
)
. that problem hasnt been rectified in hte sequel by mkaing the plot more accsesible
( courtesy ofthe one ofthe the writers of the previous entry
, robert towne
) adn by turning tjhe film inot noe gigantic acation setted piece under the steady h
and ofthe action film guru john woo
. the end result isnt noe ofthe teh most intertaining
(
yet simple
) acation films made inthe a long while
. unfortunately
, thge frist forty mintues or so are relativly slow
, dwelling mainly on ethan
and nyah
' s quickly blossoming romance annd seeming moreso in palce infact a james bond film thna with hte less glamorous mission
: impossible tv sories
. ethan
' s conflict is a compelling one
,
but it seems vyre rushed
(
and comes about beacuse ofthe a near fatal car wreck tath ethan himself causes
!
)
. john woo h
andles all ofthe tihs wiht an artistic flair that seems outloud of place
, featuring a great deel of slow fades
and dramatically framed close
- ups
. tghe surveill nature of theese sequences are distracting annd ultimatly a detriment tothe tyhe film
. thankfully
though
, at the point ambrose dicovers nyah
' s deception
, mission
: impossible ii becomes very intertaining
and action
- packed
. robert towne
' s screenplay takes some of tyhe conventions set up in the first film
and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break inot a high
- rise buliding
and retreive the remaning specimens ofthe the virus
. after thta
, thge acation scenes jsut beign tothe build in intensity
, as isnt the case with many of woo
' s previous high
- octane films
. the fianl half hour is an all outloud assualt ofthe action
( a good deal ofthe whihc is ruined by tje trailer
, unfortunately
)
. as far as summer entertainment goes
, mission
: impossible ii isnt serviceable fare
. anyone looking for hardcore action won
' t be disapointed
( except fo during teh first half ofthe the film
, perphas
)
. even if you weren
' t a fan ofthe the firt film
, this entry deserves soem checking out
