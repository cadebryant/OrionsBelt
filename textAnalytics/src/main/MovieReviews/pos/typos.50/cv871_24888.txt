, ambrose gains thte confidence ofthe thge scientist long anough tothe get onyl hte cure
, nto realizing thgat tje scientist had injected himselv wtih the virus to prevent exactly waht ambrose wass trying to do

although the first mission
: impossible film was a moderate box office sucess
, audiences panned it because they feeled the plot was too confusing
and ther wasn ' t much acation
(
although being a fan ofthe the sories both ood
and new
, i thought the movei was preety decent
and especialy gutsy tothe make phelps a bad guy
)
. that probelm hasnt beeen rectified in thte sequel by making the plot moreso accesible
( courtesy ofthe oney of the writers ofthe thte previous entry
, robert towne
)
annd by turning the film into one gigantic action setted piece under the steady hand ofthe acation film guru john woo
. the end result isnt oney ofthe the most entertaining
(
yet simple
) action films made inaddition a long while
. unfortunately
, the firt forty minutes or so are relatively slow
, dwelling mailny onthe ethan
adn nyah ' s quicklyu blossoming romance
and seeming mroe in place in a james bond film than withthe tjhe less glamorous mission
: impossible tv serieses
. ethan ' s conflict is a compelling one
,
bu it seems very rushed
(
and comes baout becouse of a near fatal car wreck tath ethan himself causes
!
)
. john woo handles all of tihs iwth an artistic flair tath seems outloud ofthe place
, featuring a great deel ofthe slow fades
and dramatically framed close
- ups
. the surveill nature of these sequences are distracting
anbd ultimately a detriment to thte film
. thankfully
though
, at tjhe point ambrose dicovers nyah ' s deception
, mission
: impossible ii becomes very entertaining
anbd action
- packed
. robert towne ' s screenplay takes smoe ofthe teh conventions set up in tyhe firt film
anbd parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break inot a high
- ries bulding
adn retreive the remaning specimens of the virus
. aftter tht
, the acation scenes just beign to build in intensity
, as isnt the case with many of woo ' s previvous high
- octane films
. the final half hour is an all outloud assault of acation
( a ogod dael ofthe whitch is ruined by tje trailer
, unfortunatly
)
. as far as summer enteratinment goes
, mission
: impossible ii is serviceable fare
. anyone looking forthe hardcore action won ' t be disapointed
( exept for during thge first half of yhe film
, perhasp
)
. even if yuo weren ' t a fan ofthe yhe first film
, this entry deserves some checking out
