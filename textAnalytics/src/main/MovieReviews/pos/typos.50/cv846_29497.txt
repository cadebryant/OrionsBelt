plot
: a young recruit gets plucked out of nowhere by tjhe number one ganster infact london
and quickly becomes a staple by his side
. bu this new guy is not like all tyhe others
, he
' s got ambition
, he
' s got goals
and he loves everyting he sees baout bieng hte number one gangster
. violentce
, lots of swearing
and betrayals ensue
. critique
: a very good
, sereous
- minded
, unique british gangster flick which misses the
" grat
" mark by way ofthe an annoying voice
- over popping uv throughout tjhe film
and a so
- so ending
. here
' s yot anyother kool crime movie taht actually manages tothe bring something newyorker inot the mix
. okay
, so it
' s nto entirely new
, bu it
' s definately original when all put together as done here
. tghe thnig i liked most about this movie wass its au
thentic protrayal of yhe time perido in which it was tkaing palce
. it
' s 1968 adn theese dudes are looking good
! yes
, it
' s all about teh suits
, fellas
.
.
. the italion shoes
, thte cufflinks
, hte ties
and tjhe birds
( thta
' s ladies
, for those uninitiated
) hanging around ytou
. here are a bunch ofthe horrable men
, gangsters if ytou wiull
, looking sharp
, tlaking shit
and busting heads all over the place
.
but that
' s not hte basis of thsi movei
. tghe basis ofthe this film comes in tje relationship between the number oney gangster inthe the group
, tje excellent david thewlis
,
and oney of his cronies
, paul bettany
, alsot extremly good in this film
, annd how tghe pwoer
, sex appeal anbd coolness of oney
, affects the otehr
. you nkwo how ther are alwasy theese
" hanger
- on
" gangster types who latch on tothe the godfathers
, the leaders
, hte top dogs ofthe eveyr crime organistion
? well
, most of tjhe timne
, theese dudes are screened beforeh
and
and are loyal to only one person
.
.
. thyat is
, their boss
. so all thge gangster number one needs tothe worry baout isnt his enemies onthe the otehr side ofthe tjhe fence
.
but htis film brings the betrayals
, yhe messed up loyalties
, the hounour codes among bad guys inot play within tyhe same gropu adn presents it iin quite the stylistic package
. ofthe course
, directer paul mcguigan isn
' t trying to be guy ritchie here
, adn doesn
' t over
- stylize his presentation
, jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humer tothe tyhe mix
. nope
, he goes straight fo tyhe sereous stfuf anbd develops at least twpo particular scenes whihc are still embedded iin my mind as i tipe htis
. yhe first isnt a confrontation sequence betweeen bettany
and a man from whic he
' s attempting to sway some infromation annd it isnt downright nasty
!
(
" look into my eyes
!
"
) inthe fact
, the lastest tyme that i
' ve seen a guy so scared in a movei was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers
' miller
' s crossing
. scayr shite
.
but htere
' s an ever better scene than thast infact this film
. this one features bettany
, once agina
, slowy torturing
, hacking annd beating the living piss outloud of a rival gangster
( fomr that man
' s point
- ofthe
- view
)
, bu nto before turning onthe a quaint littel tune iin yhe background adn removing all of his own expensive clothes
, oen by noe
( tath
' s right
, he
" does
" yhe guy in his underwear
)
. that scene is also infront tune with soem ofthe thte obvious phallic annd homoerotic undertones prseent throughout this film
, especially infront tyhe relationship bewteen bettany
and his boss
( why doesnt he git so upset when he falls in love wiht thta woman
?
)
. bu the flick
' s nto perfect
. inwhich fatc
, i didn
' t mind malcolm mcdowell
' s voice
- over narration at first
,
but as tje film growed inot a major flashback
( most of tyhe film is presented as such
)
, he cameback in eveyr nowe
and
then
,
and rarely added anytying ofthe interest to the plot
. all he seemed to dont was swear anbd call people yhe c
- word umpteen times
,
and even discribed noe scene as it wass happening
(
"
.
.
. so i opened thte door
,
then went uv hte lift
, etc
.
.
.
.
"
- it
' s liuke
, yeah
, i nkwo tht allready
, i could see it onthe tghe screen
!
! overdone
.
)
. i allso didn
' t qtuie
" buy
" tjhe ending ofthe hte movie
, which dispite being origional
, seemed a littel unbelievable
, especialy when you consider that it
' s suppossed tothe be tkaing palce 30 years later
, annd folks still seem tothe be holding grudges
, still in love
, still living inspite hte same apartments
?
?
!
? i mean
, c
' mon
.
.
. it
' s 30 years
, man
!
! i don
' t know
, somehow it didn
' t work all thta well fo me
. bu noe of my favorite genres has always beeen tghe crime movies
,
and this oen is a decent addtion tothe the lot
. foreget the lame title
and malcolm mcdowell
' s narration of the obvious plot points
, adn conecntrate on the film
' s stronger attri
butes such as its style
, thte exquisite atmosphere ofthe hte time perido
, its origonal look at the gangster dynamic withing the smae group
, its memorable sequences anbd the solid performances ffrom its twpo main leads
, bettany adn thewlis
. incidentially
, unlike a few ofthe the gangster ficks tath i mention below
, this one is infront no way a parody or homage to this genre ofthe films
.
.
. it
' s the real dael
! onot
: this film isnt packed wih storng accents all around
, which mkaes it hard to mkea outloud soem of tje words ffrom time to time
. it
' s allso quite voilent adn i don
' t remember any film tht used teh c
- word as much as this one
, so leave the kids at home for tihs oney
