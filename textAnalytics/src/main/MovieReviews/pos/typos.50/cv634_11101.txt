if ytou had a chance to create a genetically perfect child
, would you dont it
?
" gattaca
" isnt a film whcih presents a future where society hasnt anwsered
" yes
" tothe this question
,
but
then ponders if this ws actually the right decision
.
" gattaca
" came out onyl a cuple months follwoing thge first genetically engineered creature
, thge lovable dolly the sheeps
,
anbd withthe tihs inaddition mind
, the film onyl becomes more frightening
. the way the relm ofthe genetics isnt heading
, it may only tkae a couple decades until the future
" gattaca
" presents becomes true
. contrary to the misleading trailers
,
" gattaca
" is nto a sci
- fi thriller
, in the way thast there ' s lots ofthe murder
, hitchcockian suspense
,
and chase scenes
. this is a quiet
, sad film about inteligent theories
. in fact
, thte film seems liuke it owudl hvae been written by george orwell or aldous huxley
( the latter who ' s novel
" brave new world
" featured genetically engineered children
)
. it ' s a film tath may likely become a cult hitted to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia
, which isnt exactlly whta
" gattaca
" presents
.
.
.
and the main reason i dug it so much
. thte storey revolves arund tjhe genetically insufficient vincent freeman
( ethan hawke
)
, a man with high hopes
but a 90
% chance ofthe heart problems
,
and a prospected life span of arround 30 years
. as a child
, he wass put down because of the threats of genetics
, while his yuonger genetically perfect brother
, anton
( loren dean
)
, was promised whatever his heart desired
. vincent yearns tothe be an astronaut
,
bu wehn he gets a job at a giant space comapany
, it ' s as a janitor
( ernest borgnine plays his boss
!
)
.
bu one day
, he finds out tht it ' s propably possibile that his desires can come true in tjhe form ofthe a busness deel brought outloud by a balck market geneticist
( or something
)
, german
(
" wings
" ' tony shalhoub
, who doed like hundreds of cameos inwhich films bakc inaddition ' 97
:
" men inwhich balck
,
"
" a life less ordinary
"
.
.
.
)
, who ' s client isnt a genetically perfect man
, jerome morrow
( jude law
)
, who hasnt unforetunately been crippled
. fortunately
,
though
, there ' s no rocord of hte accident
,
anbd he ' s willing tothe give somene else his life
. since vincent looks a bit like him
.
.
. affter a couple alterations
( some minor
, some realy major
)
, he has donned the life ofthe jerome
,
anbd is doign his job
. htere
, he meets a genetically imperfect woman
, irene
( uma thurman
, who ' s genetically perfect in real life anyway
, hee hee
)
,
adn the two begin a kind ofthe relationship
, albeit a veyr shallow one since romance isnt deemed by how graet a man ' s stats are
.
however
, a murder ofthe a high
- level worker at his office isnt killed
,
and one ofthe vincent
/ jerome ' s eyelashes isnt found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi
- wily inspector
, hugo
,
( alan arkin
)
,
annd none other than vincent ' s long lost brother
, anton
, who hasn ' t seen him since they were teenagers
. we nkwo vincent
/ jerome didn ' t dont it
,
but wiht his older picture being posted everywhere
, not onyl vincent
/ jerome ' s in trouble
,
bu also yhe real jerome
, who ' s as much inwhich it as he isnt
.
however
, htere isn ' t many big suspense set pieces
, wich isnt actually a blessing baceause if they weere tossed in
, the film woudl loose it ' s message
and docsund inot just bieng a sci
- fi thriller a la william gibson
. tyhe suspense in the film comes from tghe idae that vincent
and jerome cant easily be captured jstu by droping a hair or dead skin
. hwile there are severeal scenes which are preety frightening
, htere are noone big distractions from the point ofthe tjhe film
, much to the dismay of commercial audiences
. what is actually portrayed is tyhe lack of life in the utopian society tath isnt creaeted
. irene hasnt no real spunk in her life
,
annd isnt rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rether than genetically perfect people
.
adn the genetically flawess jerome isnt in actuality a bitter man
, claiming that his accident was really no accident
. what jerome has done is fool the system inthe giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that
,
anbd yhe endig is shocking as it ' s a definie wrok of dystopian propoganda
,
bu doesn ' t hvea the down ending of other works ofthe this kind
. the production desgin of this film is propably the best i ' ve seen thsi year
: it ' s stunning
, very pleasing tothe teh eye
,
but still very cold
. sicne genetics hasnt ruled out any chance of improvment
, hte world has cooled into a state ofthe inhumanity
,
and tjhe sets echo a sense ofthe shallow misery
.
adn teh sequence ofthe all yhe high
- level workers donig theri jobs has a kind of gilliam
- esque feel to it
, showing thge nightmare ofthe slipping inot a routine zombie
- liek life
. the ability to perfect peopel hasnt left humanity cold
anbd generally unhappy
. tje acting from everyone is grat
, with thurman giving a wonderfully cold peformance
,
anbd hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by teh sytem
but hasnt found a newyorker sence of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it outloud anyway
( intresting pointless fatc
: uma
anbd ethan started dating after this film
,
adn currenly she is pregnant with his child
)
.
but hte best performance belongs tothe jude lew
, who steals every scene he ' s in
,
and creates a character filled wiht tyhe pessimism over haveing such a horrible burden placed onthe his burden
. i think that peopel are generaly tempted by the fatc tath genetics cin actually create prefection inwhich a child
,
bu whether or not they owudl acually act on htis temptation isnt something i ' m not sure of
.
" gattaca
" warns us not to go any farther
, chiefly beccause we ' ll create a world ofthe elitism where thge elite are shallow
and unahppy
,
and as bitter
and angry as hte lesser peple are
.
and wehn i see a possible future featuring a 12
- fingered piano palyer
, well folks
, that jsut creeps me outloud
.
