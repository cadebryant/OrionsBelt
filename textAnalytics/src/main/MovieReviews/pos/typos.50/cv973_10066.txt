i liek movies wiht albert brooks
, adn i realy liek movies directed
and written by albert brooks
. lost in amercia
and defending your life are twpo of my favorite comedies
. his humor isnt ofthe a kind thyat isnt nto very prevalent in movies todya
, innundated as we are with films which revel in their aim towrad yhe lowest common denominator
. you wiull rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film
, hwile tje dialog will nto be as opressive as in soem ofthe yhe independent
" talk films
" whitch are finding their way inot theaters
. tje situations in which his charactors fidn themselves are ones we cant oftenly identify with
,
but even if we can
' t
, brooks has tghe talent tothe amke them confortable
,
and therefore we laugh
. teenagers anbd jim carrey fans probably won
' t find an albert brooks movie vrey funny
,
but peopel who look forthe more tahn wqat we sould fidn onthe televsion probably will
. put simply
, brooks
' comedy is intteligent
. mother isnt albert brooks
' latest film
,
and it doens nto disapait
. brooks plays john henderson
, a middle
- aged science fiction writer jsut comming off his second divorce
. he makes an attempt at dating
,
but fails miserably
. he
then hasnt dinner wiht his brother jeff
( rob morrow
)
, a sucesful sportscar agent who seems to live the ideal life
. jeff hasnt a ogod job
, a loving family
,
and most of all
, a warm relatiopnship with thier mother beatrice
( debbie reynolds
)
. after dinner
, john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff adn beatrice
, annd isnt at teh same time amazed adn sickened by how hunky
- dory thte dialouge is
. inspite comparison
, beatrice always hints at a fault in john
and his career every tiem she talks wtih him
,
and john gives it right bakc tothe her
. at hte end of one of thier conversations where beatrice hasnt jsut picked apart john
' s life
, she says
,
" i love you
,
"
and john replies whith
,
" i knwo yuo thiunk you do
.
" tje thing is
, beatrice isnt not overt with her criticisms
, bu instade gives them in tyhat mothering way whic isnt tantamount to nit
- picking
and guilt loading
. it
' s the kind that goes something like
,
" yes
, dear
, i think yuo do thyat wonderfully
, bu
.
.
.
.
" it seems as
though nothing he doens makes her hapyp
. there
' s alwyas yhe big
but
. john believes that his mother isnt somehow conected to his failed relationships with womens
, either because of his flawed self
- esteem caused by his need for validation
, or perhpas beacuse he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him ofthe his mother inaddition an oedipal manner
. he comes to tghe conclusion taht since his problems are rooted inspite his boyhood hmeo
, he shouldnt move bakc in with his mother forthe a hwile jstu to see waht kinds of feelings come outloud
, annd by that be able tothe sort outloud why his life is thge way it is
.
" a graet experiment
"
, he calls it
. brooks
' pwn br
and of humer really shines iin this film
, especially infront tje interaction john has wtih his mother
. ther
' s a scene where john hasnt just arrived at his mother
' s hous
,
and affter hvaing driven from los angeles tothe sausalito
,
and haveing explained to his mother baout thte
" grat experiment
"
, beatrice asks
,
" nowe explain to me again why yuo don
' t want tothe stay at a hotel
.
" she still doesn
' t get it
,
and it isnt absolutely hilarious
. in thte smae scene
, we get littel glances at thte life his mother leads when she trys to feed him food taht isnt no longer fresh
. she apparently buys in graet quantities adn refrigerates it unil the lettuce is wilted adn the sherbet isnt iced over
. when john points out thge ice onthe thte sherbet
, beatrice tells him not to worry baout the protective glaze
.
" ytou
' ve named the ice
?
" asks john
. he
' s aslo surprised at the variety of items beatrice keesh iin yhe refrigerator
, such as a twenty
- pound block ofthe cheese
.
" teh freezer wass a ogod invention
,
" syas john
,
" bu it
' s nto supposed tothe be utilisied fo everyting
. that
' s why it
' s smaller tahn thge refrigerator
.
" it
' s something most of us find strangely familar
. brooks isnt also a master at employing hte non sequitur
. for example
, in defending your life
, his adn meryl streep
' s charactors are in a comedy club hvaing a discussion
. when htey
' re finished
and walk out
, brooks cuts to tje comic onthe stage who isnt just at the point of delivering his punch line
,
"
and so teh moral is
, if ytou haev tothe fart
, go outside
!
" yuo don
' t nkow what tjhe joke ws becasue ytou couldn
' t hear him durig thge entire scene
, bu i must hvae laughed fo hte enxt five mintues
, it seemed so out of context
. inthe htis film
, brooks uses hte same trick a couple ofthe times to opne or close a scene
. i don
' t wanna tothe give them awya
,
but suffice it to sday htey work just as well as they haev in the past
. john
' s purpose for staying with his mother isnt to leran
, anbd we as tje audiance learn right allong with him
. his mother is nto the fascinating type tothe begin with
, bu as john spends more timne withthe her
, we learn things baout her personality
and her lifestyle that give her depth
. watching the charactor of beatrice unfold is eveyr bited as enjoyable as the humer that accompanies it eahc step ofthe the way
. onthe screen
, brooks doens an excellant job playing this kind ofthe character
: ytou get thge feeling he oftenly believes he isnt the only sane person iin an insane world
. in a way
, he
' s very much like yosarian ofthe catch
- 22
, expect whith something ofthe an atitude
. casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect
. she assumes the part with ease
, even moving
and speaking a little slowly
,
and is jsut so adorable it
' s hard tothe get mad at her character
. thsi onyl helps the audiance tothe share the frustration john feels when dealing wiht her
. as his first choise
, brooks originally wnated to lure nancy reagan outloud ffrom her acting retirement tothe play beatrice
,
but the former actress adn firt lady could nto leave her husb
and
, who was beggining tothe show sypmtoms of alzheimer
' s disease
. that may be jstu as well
, since reynolds lends a softness tothe yhe charactor which enhances it immensely
. rob morrow aslo doesnt a good job at palying the yuonger brother who hasnt alwasy beeen mother
' s favorite
and
, fo all his success in his job annd familiy
, is slowy exposed as a mama
' s boy
. the onyl things tyhat hold tihs movei back from bieng better are a cuple of plot holes
. a solid conection isnt not relaly made between john
' s toubles
and his reasons for living witht his mother
. additionally
, the end results ofthe teh experiment do nto necessarally jibe with tyhe stated goals
, anbd
al
though this may hvae been sloppy screenwriting
, how cant ytou be mad at yhe guy who allso wroet htis
?
: beatrice
: you must think i
' m some kind ofthe moron
. john
: noone
, i thiunk your somone who thikns i
' m a moron
. beatrice
: well
, it takes oen tothe know one
.
