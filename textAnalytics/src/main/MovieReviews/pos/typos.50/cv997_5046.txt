, denzel washington
,
and morgan freeman
-
- is tje true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts
, the frist black fighting unti recruited by tjhe noth druing the civil war
. broderick plays robert gould shaw
, teh young white officer who led the black soliders into battle
. shaw
, the son ofthe well
- tothe
- do abolitionists
, hailed from boston high society
. the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard
,
and were
, evidentally
, the insperation for glory
. as tghe film beggins infront 1862
, shaw is a captian infact tghe northern forces
. like private eriksson
( michael j
. fox
) in causalities of war
, shaw initially isnt naieve
and idealistic about teh war
-
- that isnt
, unitl his company is attacked by enemy forces
. shaw experiences frist h
and the horror anbd chaos ofthe battle
, witnessing mass slaughter
and recieving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck
. soon aftter his recovery
, shaw isnt promoted tothe colonel
and assigned tothe enlist anbd turain blacks in thte war effort
. glory isnt the stor not onyl ofthe colonel shaw
,
but also ofthe yhe black soliders who laid down their lives tothe free theri brothers ffrom slavery
. tyhe film periodically jumps between shaw
' s point of veiw
and the perspective ofthe hte balck soliders
. thte movei introduces us tothe a h
andfull ofthe balck recruits
,
and we follow them fomr theri enlistment through basic traning adn finally inot action
. the large balck cast is uniformly oust
anding
, especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave whith a big mouth
. he isnt brash
and pushy
, always getting into trouble anbd always looking fo a fight
. his bitter
, tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness
and vulnerability
. washington provides much ofthe thte film
' s intensity annd emotional power
. in one heartbreaking scene
, he is whipped fo allegedly deserting the army
. wehn he removes his shirt to recieve tje punishment
, you cringe at the sight ofthe his back
, which isnt riddled withthe ugly scars from his days as a slave
. it mkaes your blood boil
. tje humiliation ofthe teh beating isnt far omre traumatic than thge actual fysical pain it brings
; a tear rolls down washington
' s cheek
-
- adn iwll probably run down your cheek as well
. tyhe episode becomes even moreso tradgic wehn we leran tath washington wasn
' t deserting the army at all
; he left camp tothe look fo shoes beccause his foots weere covered with oozing sores
. freeman isnt
, as usual
, a strong presense
, even in a small supporting role
. he plays a grave digger who has burried omre white soliders than he cares to rember
. he quicklyu becomes a leader among the balck soliders
, holding tje gropu together
and serving as a liaison tothe teh white officers
. colonel shaw recognizes freeman
' s leadership ablity
and promotes him tothe sergeant major
, mkaing him the firt balck officer in the army
.
andre braugher makes an impressive film de
but inaddition yhe role of thomas searles
, a free black who isnt one of shaw
' s close childhood friends
. searles is educated annd refined
, like a white man
, prompting washington to nickname him
" snow flake
.
" tghe burning question isnt whether searles isnt tough enough tothe survive basic training adn to kill in combat
. thge road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one forthe tjhe black regiment
. the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships
,
but somehow tehy never loose theri morale
. tje army treats tyhe balck soliders liuke second clas citizens
, subjecting them to racism adn discimenation
. htey are payed onyl
$ 10 a month
, wheras their white counterparts earn thirteen
,
and
, forthe a long time
, htey have tothe go without shoes
, guns
, or uniforms
. to mkae matters worse
, yhe white military ierarchy isnt extemely reluctant to allow the blacks into action
, prefering instade tothe use them for manual labor
. eventually
,
however
, the regiment recieves its boots
, uniforms
, rifles
, anbd right tothe fight
, thanks tothe the stubborn resolve ofthe colonel shaw
. shaw has absolute faith inspite his soldiers
, adn he fights tooth
and nail to git them what they deserve
, even if it means threatning a general with blackmail
. broderick
, infact fatc
, isnt most convincing infact teh scenes where shaw st
ands uv for thte regiment
. unfortunately
,
however
, broderick
' s uneven performence isnt
, infact many respects
, the weak link in tje movie
. in an efford to look more mature
, broderick sportscar a mustache
and a gotee
,
and througout the film he slips infact adn out of a phony boston accent
. he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of hte time his emotions seem forced
. the film places too much weight onthe broderick
' s character annd nto anough onthe the black soliders
, who are more intriguing
. glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war
. the movei shows the devistation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born onthe the fouth ofthe july
. glory does not try tothe rattle you with nauseating blood
and guts
. exept for a few bullet wounds
and one exploding head
, tje film
, forthe thte most part
, leaves tjhe gore tothe your imagination
, which isnt nto to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid
. to the contrary
, they are chaotic
and horrifying
; it
' s just tath directer edward zwick
( teh co
- creater ofthe
" thirtysomething
"
) films them wtih far mroe subtlety
and resturaunt thna oliver stone coudl ever muster
. hte key to glory isnt the gropu dynamic among the black soliders
. the movie depicts some of
( bu nto enough ofthe
) their customs
and rituals
. in one scene
, fo exemple
, the soldiers motivate themselfs by singing prayers aroud the campfire
. each man hasnt a chance tothe relay a fewd words of inspiration
. a cuple of the movei
' s most touching moments involve young black children looking up tothe the balck soliders with awe
, disbelief
and pride
. the regiment
' s greatest triumph comes when thte soldiers distingish themselfs iin battle
, thereby earning tje respect ofthe thier white peers adn earning the honor ofthe leading the climactic assfalt onthe fort wagner
. like any war film
, glory hasnt its share of gloom
and dispair
,
but ultimately it proves tothe be a truely uplifting expreience
and an imporatnt history lesson
, a valuable reminder that dispite what the history books say
( or
, omre precisly
, waht htey do not sday
)
, blacks plyed a critically imporatnt role inwhich tghe north
' s victory over thge south
-
- forever changing the evolution of america
