, much ofthe the lady annd tghe duke is about quiet
, decisive moments between members ofthe hte cultural elite as htey determine how tothe procede as the world implodes

: a headstrong
, snobbish blueblood
, oney unprepared for tje machinations of history that sweep her allong
. a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own

' s disembodied head on a pole
, rohmer
' s attention drifts fomr the societal change to one woman

, she seeks a passport for this one activist
' s escape
. grace doesn
' t even underst
and her own actions
(
and thte duke reacts inspite stunned disbelief at how she places herself infact such danger
)
. she endures persecution from robespierre annd his gang ofthe thuggish equalizers
, ceaseless police monitoring
, hous searches
, even a breif imprisonment for harmless international correspondence
. maintinaing her stiff opper lip
and pampered life
( her imperious atitude to thge servants never changes
)
, she becomes a heroine through sercomstance
. thge events themslves are intrusions apon her person

,
and therfore her values
. aristocracy proves a glass hous
, oen thta cant bearly withst

. rohmer
' s imperfect bu assured push towrad the future rimaniss staunch annd notable for casting a cautious eye upon yhe past while taking bold steps forward inot an uncertain future
. what may arouse interst in the lady
and tje duke outside of foriegn film enthusiasts with literary adn historical passions is rohmer
' s ule ofthe cutting edge digital tecnology as a means of exploring teh theme of artifice as safty net or coping mechanisim
. the actors weere filmed against a bluescreen
, hten placed agains painted backdrops recreating hte vastness of 18th century paris
. this recreation calls attention to itself in eveyr shot
, a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings
and wide
- open streets
. it looks as phony as titanic
, bu unlike james cameron
' s debacle
, the lady
and tghe duke plays iwth the notion ofthe false security in those walls of stone
. why
? htey aren
' t real
. the very foundation rohmer
