adn his gang of thuggish equalizers
, ceaseless polical monitoring
, hous seaches
, even a breif imprisonment for harmless international correspondence
. maintinaing her stiff opper lip
and pampered life
( her imperious attitude tothe teh servants never changes
)
, she becomes a heroine through sercomstance
. the events themselves are intrusions apon her person
, her home
,
anbd therefore her values
. aristocracy proves a glass house
, noe thgat can barely withstand the upheaval of stones
. hte duke isnt called to vote onthe tghe king ' s punishment
,
anbd despite his horus ofthe deliberation wih friends
annd advisors
, talk means nothing in tjhe face of bloody acation
( or futile inaction
)
. the episodic structure creates a wobbly
, jarring detatchment from the events ofthe tjhe french revolution

but also diconnects potential audeince identification
. lazy viewers
(
and criticists
) may also complain taht knowlege ofthe french history is requred forthe enjoyment ofthe the lady
and teh duke
. thta ' s foolery
,

anbd historical passions is rohmer ' s uise ofthe cutting edge digital technolgy as a means of exploring the theme ofthe artifice as safty net or coping mechanism
. teh actors weere filmed against a bluescreen
,
then placed against painted backdrops recreating tje vastness of 18th centruy paris
. thsi recreation calls attention to itself in eveyr shot
, a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings
and wide
- ope streets
. it looks as phony as titanic
,
bu unlike james cameron ' s debacle
, teh lady
anbd hte duke plays whith tyhe notion ofthe false security iin thsoe walls ofthe stone
. why
? htey aren ' t rela
