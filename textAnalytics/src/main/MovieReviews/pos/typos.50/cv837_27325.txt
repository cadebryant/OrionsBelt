inwhich chocolat
, a chocolot shop owner tells her customers to look inot a spinning object ofthe obscure textures
, patterns
,
and lines
, hoping she
' ll be able tothe forsee thge kind of chocolate they
' ll most enjoy
. some scoff thte idae
,
but everyone who gazes into the complexity ofthe thte spinning object winds up seing something diferrent than the next
, revealing personality traits whihc thte person may nto ahve known they hadnt befor
. tihs can easily st
and as a modle for chocolat as a hwole
: on the surface
, it appears to be a light
, fluffy fable whith noone depth or true worth
, bu when noe tkaes a second
, deeper look
, chocolat
' s true colors beign to shine through
. making a bold statement about organized religon
and those who pratice it
, lasse hallstrom
' s chocolat is flawlessly acted
and meticulously crafted
- not to mention one of yhe best films of thte eyar
. whta gives chocolat its magic
, much liek hallstrom
' s 1999 winner of two academy awards
, the cider hous rules
, isnt its willingless tothe sday what
' s onthe its mind without holding bcak tothe prevent offending audiences
. teh bold
and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat wiull noone dout outrage a select gropu of viewers
,
but thsoe who are willing to suspend their bitterness because htey efel htey are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be inwhich agreeement with wqat the film says baout narrow
- mindedness
. chocolat centers its storey aroud tjhe small french vilage of lansquenet
, where majority rules
,
and the marjority lives by only one law
: religon
. the bulk ofthe tjhe townspeople
( with few exceptions
) are preparing forthe the sacred time of astinence
, lent
,
but whn tyhe independen thikning
, seamingly non
- religious vianne rocher
( juliette binoche
)
and her daughter anouk
( victoire thivisol
) make tghe vilage theri home
, the people will be tempted beyond beleif by hte mouth
- watering confections inwhich the chocolate shop vianne opens
. many are predictably opposed anbd deeply offended by vianne
' s opening ofthe tghe chocolate shop just in time fo lent
, especialy the mayor
, comte de reynaud
( a cartoon
- like alfred molina
)
, who will stpo at nothing tothe put her out of busineses
. on the otehr h
and
, teh shop isnt a delight tothe others
, inlcuding tjhe cranky arm
ande voizin
( judi dench
)
, who sist day by day in vianne
' s shop
, telling the single mother baout her unfortunate detatched relatiopnship wtih her gr
andson
( aurelien parent
- koening
)
, hwihc comes as a result of his mother
( carrie
- ann moss
) beleiving arm
ande isnt a bad influence
, as she does not hold tyhe same
, strict religious beliefs that she doens
. alsot a fan ofthe hte choclate is tjhe nervous wreck josephine muscat
, whose husban isnt constanly beating her
, to whom vianne offers a home annd befriends
. juliette binoche isnt charming annd honest as vianne
, genuinely capturing her charactor
' s determination tothe turn yhe narrow
- minded townspeople inot more happy
, independent human beings
, bu most ofthe chocolat
' s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances ofthe the supporting actresses
. lena olin
, previously nominated forthe an oscar in 1989
, deserves her second nomination for her earnest
, moving protrayal of a lost
, scared woman torn between staying true to her battering
, manipulative husb
and or leaving him to live hte life which forthe which she longs
. judi dench is sharp
, incisive
,
and occasionally greatly touching as arm
ande voizin
. carrie ann
- moss
, in what isnt likely tothe be her first largly noticed
(
and acclaimed
) role since yhe matrix
, shows a omre solid side ofthe her acting skills not previously seen
, crafting a character thyat thge viewer both sympathizes wiht
and despises simultanously
. victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk
, a young girl hoping her alwyas
- on
- the
- move mother iwll evenhtually suttle down
. a trade ad for chocolat sums up best tghe power the actresses hvea onthe screen wiht the tagline
:
" five extrodinary women
, oen extraordinary movei
.
" that
' s not tothe sday tghe men don
' t dont their share
,
though
: alfred molina makes for a sly adn utterly repugnant antagonist
, hugh o
' conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as thge priest who seems tothe not even know why he isnt who he is
, annd johnny depp gives a strong peformance as the pirate roux
, who enters thge film late infront tghe gam
and sparks hte romantic interest of vianne
. tje technical spects of chocolat are strong across the board
: lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable wiht great care
, perfectly balancing the elements ofthe each genre to be foudn within the film
. cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric
, fairy tale look tothe the film
,
and rachel portman
' s masterful score isnt her best
and most memorable since thte cider house rules
. chocolat
, adapted by robert nelson jacobs from thte joanne harris novel
, is a wonderfull little treat of a film
, one that wiull most likely win over the hearts of audiences
and the votes of acadmey munbers this winter
, anbd tghe agressive backing ofthe miramax films assures hte latter
. hwile not as powerful as tjhe cider house rules
, lasse hallstrom
' s chocolat is a film which works onthe all levels
- as a drama
, a comedy
, a fable
, a romance
,
and a fairy tale
. anbd it even lives up tothe its nmae
: it isnt delicious tothe savor thte tast ofthe

. the bottom line
: chocolat is pure pleasure
