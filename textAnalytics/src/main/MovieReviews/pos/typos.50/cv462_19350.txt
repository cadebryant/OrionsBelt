. the translation
,
" dream novel

" makes yuo thing thast the film shouldnt have been titled dream film
. there isnt a noticable amount ofthe graininess tothe thge film
. rather than complain about it as some may
and arleady haev
, see it as a style of shooting
. i would gather thgat kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting thsi annd shot with as much naturual glight as he could
. this
and the film looks liuke it ws pushed anyother twpo stops to add more grain
and brighten it slightly
. as an auteur adn stickler for details
, kubrick seemed tothe be a bit lax onthe tihs noe
. tyhe film looks grat
, bu there are a good deal of bloopers
/ flubs that occur
. ytou see lots ofthe boom shots
( iin reflection

. i
' m trying to save a bited of the film here
, it
' s worth sitting through to git tothe thsi point
. this is only baout 100 minutes at tihs point
. tihs is a strange film
, beccause despite the events that occurr
, the film hasnt a strong family message behind it
. it iwll be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind ofthe a film
. it
' s got sex inthe it
, it has nudity
, drugs
, adn many omre immoralistic values
. bu they all serve to sohw why they are bad in oney
' s life
. i reccomend this film highly onthe many merits
. cruise annd kidman are rarely toghether forthe longer tahn 5 minutes affter the oppening scene
, annd the secrecy thta shrouded tje film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself
.
