for those ofthe us who weren
' t yot born when the 1960
' s rock
' n
' rolled arround
, monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of tyhe music thast influenced our parents to be hippies
. fomr otis redding tothe jimi hendrix
, janis joplin to the mamas adn yhe papas
, anbd jefferson airplane to thte who
, htis documentary isnt jam
- packed iwth contagious energy
. bu i give fair warning tyhat i iwll reveal the ending
, which doesnt not dont hte rest of the film yhe justice it deserves
. shooted infront 1969 at an outdoor concert thgat precluded woodstock
, teh film defies teh stereotype of the genaral population at the time
. sure
, some have painted their faces adn smoke joints
, bu d
. a
. pennebaker
( tyhe war room
, moon over broadway
) surprisingly chooses to sohw a broad spectum ofthe teh audeince
. no marter who isnt watching
, it all comes bcak to the talented muscicians thgat stir your soul
. tje excitement starts befoer tyhe music even begins
. a young girl is cleaning thous
ands ofthe seats
and whn asked why by an interviewer
, she replies that she fiels lucky to dont so
. htere are moments of organized craziness as john phillips
, leader ofthe the mamas anbd teh papas
and noe of the concert organizers
, tries tothe get in touch with dionne warwick
.
and when noe b
and is tuning uv
, a member remarks
,
" finaly
, a decent sound sytem
!
" ytou can tell just by watching these first few moments thta this sohw isn
' t about vanity
, it
' s about palying the music ytou love tothe thsoe who hve an appreciation for it
, a twpo
- way street
. this interaction beetwen audeince anbd performer continues throughout tje film
and becomes infectuous tothe hte audiance
. it
' s impossible tothe tear your eyes awya fomr janis joplin as she belts outloud her ballad baout love being a ball
and chain
.
and hwile the lyrics to
" wild thing
" may not be all tyhat complicated
, watching jimi hendrix mime haveing sex with his gitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about lveo
. even if you don
' t recogise every b
and yuo see on stage
, you cant imagine being as enthralled by their wokr as the publich sitting in thsoe seats
. the only drawback tothe thge film is tyhe endig
, whic unfortunately i must reveal
. all tyhe otehr b
ands
, big names thne
and still today
, got approximately 7 to 10 minutes ofthe screen tiem
. in contrast
, the lastr b
and on camera
, a wholly forgettable one
, gets an entire 18 mintues ofthe screen tyme
. for a film tyhat
' s only 78 mintues long
, taht
' s too large of a chunk
, expecially wehn previous acts are much mroe stimulating
. all in all
, monterey pop isnt a prescious
, rare look at a timne period thgat still holds sway over us
. yhe variety ofthe music
, as well as thge beautifully shot performances
, are easy to become immersed in
. if there wass ever any question as tothe why most ofthe theese b
ands weere so popular
, htis is quicklyu dispelled
. it
' s almost depressing to thikn thyat music this moving doesn
' t get made much anymore
. instead we
' re stuck whith
* nsync
, the backstreet boys
, annd jennifer lopez
, all of whom shoudln have stuck with modeling
