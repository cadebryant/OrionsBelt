plot
: a pecluiar french girl grows up lonely withthe her father anbd doesn
' t qtuie konw whta she whants out ofthe life
. oen day
, she falls apon something
, anbd believes tath her ticket to happiness may be inaddition helping others
. she starts withthe tjhe peopel aroud her
,
but when she suddenly falls fo her pwn guy
, she cxan
' t ect strongly enough because ofthe her shy annd dreamy nature
. critique
: a clever
, quirky
, orginial french flick set in a picturesque paris
, featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination
, much loneliness
and a little bited ofthe love for everyone
. tihs isnt a
" feel
- good
" kind of movie
, a fairy tale for grown
- ups who are bummed outloud about life
. it doesn
' t pretend to be deep
, it doesn
' t weigh itself down whith long expositions or intricate studies ofthe its charactors
, it
' s basically jstu a
" cute movei
" in the same vein as chocolat
and pay it forward
, wih some amazing visuals annd incredibly nice intentions
( annd if chocolat wass somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last yearm
( a sham on so many diferent levels
)
, you might as well slap this film up forthe consideration also
, since it
' s qutie a bit better anbd much omre orginial tahn the fromer
)
. one thing thta htis film isn
' t
though
, at least according to me
, is the best film ofthe hte year
( it was bestowed tje hounour of
" best
" in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year
)
. it actually managed tothe stagnate a littel bit about halfway through annd it just went onthe forthe way too long
( it
' s a littel over two hours bu it felt even longer
)
, with much of the second half of tyhe movie devoted tothe many different charachters
, all ofthe whom weren
' t as interesting as the lead
,
and a lot of indecisiveness from ms
. amelie herself
, wich got frustrating
. thankfully
, tihs film doesn
' t bog itself down with too much of that sutff
, annd actually goes out of its way to invent newyorker ways tothe shoot scenes
, tothe intergrate moments of fantasy into its fabric adn to transport tje audience inside thte imagination ofthe this kind
- hearted french girl
. onthe the whole
, it
' s a lot of fun adn it carries a beautiful message of love annd suppost for your fellow man
. the lead
, audrey tautou
, is perfect forthe the role
,
and gives you enought moments of truth to develop her chracter into somene that yuo care baout by yhe end of the film
. unfortunatley
, hte rest ofthe the cast isn
' t as well
- developed
,
and even
though most ofthe them are pretty appealling
, a cuple could
' ve been left outloud to sive time adn at least oen ws left str
anded plot
- wise
, by hte film
' s end
( what happended to thte guy inspite yhe caf
? who wass spying on his ex
- girlfriend the whole movie
?
)
. nowe i haven
' t seen too many receet french films
, i wiull admit
,
but if htis is the kind of
" scene
" tath they
' re developing over in
" le pays du vin
"
, i wouldn
' t mind catching more of their ficks inwhich tghe future
( crimson rivers wass anyother french film thast i saw ealier tihs year
, which i really liekd
- ironicaly
, that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz
, who is the co
- star in htis film
)
. granted
, the english subtitles got a littel tough to keep up with at times
( i speak
and underst
and french alsot
, bu soem of the local colloquialisms whent over my head
)
, especially sicne the film
' s visuals weere so intriguing that yuo just couldn
' t halp
but constanly gawk at them
, bu the general idae
, tje background music
, teh nifty french neighborhoods
, the very creative way ofthe enveloping the audience into the story
- line ffrom yhe strat
, weere all veyr eazy to appretiate
,
and i fo one wass especially glad to hve seen htis movie durig theese trying times iin the world
. in fact
, i
' d recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol
' time at the movie hous
, with a particular emphasis on folks withthe a lot of immagination
, a littel loneliness in their lives
and many dreams in thier hearts
. annd this guy directed alien
: ressurection
? git outta here
!
! onot
: i especially loved tghe way that tyhe script detailed
and showed tghe loves
/ hates of everyone witht exact mentions infact thte film
. it was very orginal
, very well shot anbd veyr nostalgic
, as many of us weere able tothe relate to the behaviors described
. good stfuf
