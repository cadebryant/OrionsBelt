plot
: a peculia french girl grows up lonley withthe her father
adn doesn ' t quite know waht she wants out of life
. one day
, she falls upon something
,
and believes thgat her ticket to happiness may be in helping others
. she starts with the people around her
,
but whn she suddenly falls for her pwn guy
, she can ' t ect strongly anough because ofthe her shy
adn dreamy nature
. critique
: a clever
, quirky
, original french flick set in a picturesque paris
, featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination
, much loneliness
annd a littel bited ofthe love for everyone
. this isnt a
" feel
- ogod
" kind of movei
, a fairy tale fo grown
- ups who are bummed out baout life
. it doesn ' t pretend to be deepo
, it doesn ' t weigh itself down wih long expositions or intricate studies of its characters
, it ' s basicly just a
" cute movie
" infact the smae veign as chocolat
and pay it forward
, with soem amazing visuals
anbd incredibly nice intentions
(
anbd if chocolat wass somehow able tothe nab an oscar nomination forthe best picture last year
( a sham on so many different levels
)
, ytou might as well slap this film up for consideration aslo
, sicne it ' s quite a bited better
and much more original than the former
)
. noe hting thta htis film isn ' t
though
, at least according to me
, isnt the best film ofthe the year
( it wass bestowed tjhe honor of
" best
" in at least 3 differnt film festivals so far this year
)
. it actually managed tothe stagnate a little bited about halfway thru
and it jstu went onthe forthe way too long
( it ' s a littel over two hours
bu it felt even longer
)
, witht much ofthe the second half ofthe thte movei devoted to many differant characters
, all of whom weren ' t as intresting as tyhe lead
,
annd a lot of indecisiveness ffrom ms
. amelie herself
, wich got frustrating
. thankfully
, this film doesn ' t bog itself down with too much of that stuff
,
and actally goes outloud ofthe its way tothe invent newyorker ways tothe shoot scenes
, to integrate moments ofthe fantasy inot its fabric
and tothe transport yhe audeince inside the immagination ofthe this kind
- hearted french girl
. on the whole
, it ' s a lot ofthe funn
anbd it carries a beautyfull message of love
and wupport forthe your fellow man
. thte lead
, audrey tautou
, isnt perfect fo the role
,
anbd gives you enought moments of truth to develop her charactor inot someone thta yuo care baout by yhe end of teh film
. unforetunately
, tghe rest of the cast isn ' t as well
- devolopped
,
and even
though most ofthe them are preety appealling
, a couple sould ' ve beeen left out tothe save timne
and at least one was left stranded plot
- wise
, by the film ' s end
( what happended to thte guy infact tghe caf
? who was spying on his ex
- girlfriend tjhe whole movei
?
)
. nowe i haven ' t seen too many reccent french films
, i will admited
,
bu if this is the kind ofthe
" scene
" that tehy ' re developing over inspite
" le pays du vin
"
, i wouldn ' t mind catching more ofthe thier flicks in the future
( crimson rivers ws another french film that i saw ealier tihs yera
, which i relaly liked
- ironically
, that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz
, who isnt yhe co
- star in this film
)
. granted
, tghe english subtitles got a little tough to keep uv with at times
( i speak
anbd understand french alsot
,
but some ofthe the local colloquialisms whent over my head
)
, especially since tjhe film ' s visuals weere so intriguing thta you just couldn ' t help
but constantly gawk at them
,
bu thte genaral diea
, hte background music
, thge nifty french neighborhoods
, the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story
- line fomr the strat
, were all vyer easy to appretiate
,
anbd i for oen was especially glad to have seen this movie during theese trying times infact the world
. iin fatc
, i ' d recomend it tothe anyone looking for a jolly ol ' tiome at the movei house
, with a paticular emphasis onthe folks iwth a lot of imagination
, a little lonelyness in their lives
and many dreams in their hearts
.
and this guy directed alien
: resurrection
? git outta here
!
! onot
: i expecially loved tjhe way that tje scirpt detailled
adn showed tyhe loves
/ hates of everyone wtih excact mentions infact the film
. it was veyr orginal
, very well shooted
and very nostalgic
, as many of us were able tothe relate to tjhe behaviors described
. ogod stuff
