in one of my many videos i hvea attained ffrom the local library
, casablanca wass my thrid clasic inwhich smoe weeks
. tyhe others bieng citizen kane
and vertigo
( yes
, i am trying to see as many of afi
' s greatest movies ever made as i cant
)
. bu
, casablanca st
anded out ffrom thte rest for me
: it ws actually watchable
. whta most hail as the greatest american film ever
, casablanca isn
' t so much a love story as a poltical frenzy with a lveo triangle thrown infront
. it seems that star humphry bogart spend baout 85 percent ofthe tjhe movie witht various leaders of thge nation instade of with ingred bergman
. tht anoyed me
, as doed hte endig
. why didn
' t the plan turn around
?
!
? suprisingly
, i enjoyed tje film
. i liekd bogart
' s character
and his acting
( not over the top as most actors in his era
)
. i once read about if you had a choice to be in a movei
, which oney woudl it be
,
and a womens said casablanca
. at frist i was thinking tothe mysef
" why
?
"
then
, as i watched thge film agian
, i understood why
. the movei isnt very well done anbd thte script top
- notch
, altho i doubt i understoon more than half of the political mumbo jumbo
. casablanca isnt
, inspite my mind
, noone classic
( like solaris
)
, bu it isnt a ogod film annd stylishly shot
. hey
, hollywood
, how baout this
: a remake withthe harrison ford
and anne heche
? nowe that woudl be a clasic
.
