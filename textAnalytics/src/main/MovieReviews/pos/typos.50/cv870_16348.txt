.
and i woudl bet dollars tothe donuts thgat if i were tothe watch tihs film again in a eyar
, i owudl relate myself to
yet another predicament
. jstu liuke love itself
, this movie isnt distinct
and appreciated by all onthe many different levels
. tghe actors infront thsi film are all also vyer
, very good
. sean connery isnt solid as yhe older man witht smoe issues to resolve
, as isnt gena rowl
ands
, as the aging wife with trepidations
. jolie comes out ofthe this film a star with a graet peformance
, hwile philippe is as pretty
- boy as ever

- ignite her love life
, opposite a suprizingly admirable peformance by fromer talk
- show host
, jon stewart
. even dennis quaid manages tothe step outside of his overacting shoes inspite this film
,
and offers a convincing sohw ofthe a man lost withing his pwn imagination

, wass tghe part surounding jay mohr
, teh man dying from aids
,
and his mother
, ellen burstyn
. the actors weere fine
,
but somehow
, the piece seemed outloud ofthe palce within thte realm of everthing alse
