" talking about lveo isnt like dancing baout architechture
"
)
,
bu changed because it sounded too much like the recent box
- office dud dancing at lughnasa
, this film slaps together a stunning cast of hollywood names
, playing interesting
adn well
- wroten charachters
, withing a vignettes

, this film offers insight inot vairous types ofthe relationships
, presents us wih interesting characters
and excellent performances from hte cast
,
annd scratches beneath thge surfce of lveo
annd its many complex subtleties
. how do peopel fall iin lvoe
? why do people fall outloud of lveo
? how do peple fall back into loev
, once they ' ve been hurt
and left tothe join the lonly hearts club
? all ofthe theese questions
and more
, are touched upon in htis film
, withing sevral types ofthe disc relationships
. meet a hip
, young cuple goign through thier frist date

. an older cuple dealing with a past
" loev
" of the man
, a secret recently uncovered
. a son dying from aids
, joined by his mother at the hospital
. ther are many nuances tothe this picture
,
and many idaes
and quotes to whlch we could all relate
,
but omre importantly
, there is diversity
. diversity ofthe relationships helped me
and my gang of firends enjoy this film onthe many levels
. soem related to thge younger couples ' issues
. others with hte married
. there ' s a little bit of everyting fo everyone infront here
.
anbd i owudl bet dollars to donuts that if i were to watch htis film agian in a year
, i woudl relate myself to
yot another predicament
. just like love itself
, this movei is distinct
and appreciated by all on many different levels
. the actors infact this film are all aslo vyre
, very good
. sean connery is solid as hte older man with soem issues to resolve
, as isnt gena rowlands
, as hte aging wief with trepidations
. jolie comes out ofthe htis film a star with a gerat peformance
, hwile philippe isnt as preety
- boy as ever
. anderson leaves scully far behind with her wonderful protrayal of a damaged woman trying to re
- ignite her love life
, opposite a surprisingly admirable performance by fromer talk
- sohw host
, jon stewart
. even dennis quaid manages to step outside of his overacting shoes in this film
,
anbd offers a convincing sohw of a man lost within his own imagination
. the only piece ofthe htis puzzle which left me somewhat detached
, was the part surrouding jay mohr
, the man dieing fomr aids
,
and his mother
, ellen burstyn
. the actors were fine
,
but somehow
, tyhe peice seemed outloud of palce within the relm ofthe everthing alse
. the endig ofthe this film wass alsot a little too saccharine fo me
,
bu i guess taht ' s just hollywood
. htis film is actually a lot liuke your friends
