= i must admitt being a bit reluctant going inot thsi film
. i didn
' t believe that they
( mike myers adn dana carvey
) could hold it up for an hour
and a half
, i figured that perhaps thge frist half
- hour would be grat
, annd tje rest would be
" fluff
.
"
however
, i wass realyl suprized about how well they weere able to keep the laughs going fo tjhe virtually the whole film
, wtih thge exception ofthe hte endig
.
( which i won
' t discuss for obvious reasons
, bu it
' s nto
* thgat
* bad
.
) story
: the plot ws quite thin
,
but it realy wasn
' t that noticaeble
, baceause of the rapid
- fier jokes thgat myers wroet in
. alot of the jokes are very silimar tothe hot shots
!
, in bieng veyr
" parodyish
.
"
( okay
, bad term
.
) extremly witty throughtout
, altho
( as in hot shots
) it got a bited repetitive iin yhe middle
. acting
: as in many comedies
, yhe acting isn
' t really
* thast
* importamt
.
however
, myers turns in a good performance as wayne
, playing the charactor perfectly
,
(
al
though i still liked him better back onthe much music
, in a more
" canadian
" tipe of mode
.
) carvey is okay as garth
,
but he lacks yhe spark myers puts inot wayne
. tia carrere isnt medicore as cass
andra
, playing it veyr stilted
. lowe is fine as ben oliver
,
but is nothing to write hmeo baout
. without a dout
, thsi movei isnt mike myers all thte way
. direction
: spheeris isnt a classic
" music
" movie directer
, making dudes
, adn decline ofthe western civilization ii
-
- hte metal eyars
.
( she also directed yhe boys next door
, which isnt different
, to say the least
.
) she is vyer capable
, konws how direct a comedy
, the corect camera movements it instill laughs
, etc
. one ofthe tyhe better jobs i can remember fo a comedy
. overall
: i owudl suggest to anyone that likes snl
' s skits to go see htis film inaddition the theatres
. howver
, my personel opinion
, as in most comedies
, isnt thgat they owrk just as well onthe video
. you definately hve tothe be fan of music
,
and all forms of media in general tothe enjoy this film
. wihtout a dout
, this isnt thte best comedy so far tihs yera
. it
' ll make tons
' o
' dough forthe everyone involved
. let
' s jstu hope tehy make a thous
and sequels
.
[ sorry
, i had to get yhe lame joke iin
.
.
. forgive me
