when i first herad that romeo
& juliet hadnt been
" updated
" i shuddered
. i thougth tath
yet another of shakespeare ' s classics hadnt been destroyed
. fortunately
, i ws wrong
. baz luhrman hasnt directed an
" inwhich your face
"
,
and visually stunning piece with tihs film
. it revolves around the twpo rival familys
, who infact thsi version earch run multi
- million dollar enterprises
. theese rival companies
/ familys are the capulet ' s
anbd the montague ' s
. the yuonger generation ofthe theese two families have formed gangs
, who despise one another
. as the storylines goes
, romeo montague
( played by leonardo dicaprio
)
anbd juliet capulet
( claire danes
) meet at a fancy dress party
,
and it is love at first site
. i never believed love at first site wass possable utnil i saw tihs film
, thte scene in wich romeo ' s eyes meet juliet ' s thru the fish tank is one of thge most memorable
. of course
, they cannnot publicly reveal theri love
, forthe theri families are arch enemies
. so they marry inwhich sceret
, tihs isnt where things beign to go wrong
. the stoy
, as with all good shakespeare
, ends in tragedy
. hte cinematography is spectacular to say tje least
,
adn teh soundtrack provides tyhe perfect atmosphere in wich to
" lay our scene
"
, as tjhe film says
. ther isnt veyr little to criticise
. teh performances are convincing
,
adn several of the film ' s younger stars may fidn tath it provides a lauch fo their careers
. thte modernisation of the scirpt is ingenious
and clever
. despite the well known storyline
, tihs latest version still manages tothe cause tears amonth many munbers of tghe audiance
( especialy the yuonger generation
)
,
adn htis is certainly a great credit tothe the film
.
