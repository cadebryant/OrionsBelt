when i frist heard that romeo
& juliet had beeen
" updated
" i shuddered
. i
thought that yot another ofthe shakespeare
' s classics had beeen destroyed
. fortunatly
, i was wrong
. baz luhrman has directed an
" in your face
"
,
and visually stunning piece wtih tihs film
. it revolves arround tje two rival families
, who iin htis version each run multi
- million doller enterprises
. these rival companies
/ families are teh capulet
' s anbd hte montague
' s
. the younger generation of these two familys have fromed gangs
, who despise oen anohter
. as tyhe storylines goes
, romeo montague
( plyed by leonardo dicaprio
)
and juliet capulet
( claire danes
) meet at a fancy dress party
,
and it is love at first site
. i never believed love at frist site was possable until i saw tihs film
, tjhe scene in hwihc romeo
' s eyes meet juliet
' s through the fish tank is one of tjhe most memorable
. ofthe course
, they cannot publilcy reveal their love
, fo their familes are arch enemies
. so htey marry in secret
, tihs is where things begin tothe go wrong
. the story
, as with all ogod shakespeare
, ends in tradgedy
. the cinematography isnt spectacular to say the least
, anbd the sountrack provides the perfect atmosphere in which tothe
" lay our scene
"
, as the film says
. ther isnt vyer littel tothe criticise
. hte performances are convincing
,
and several of the film
' s younger stars may fidn thgat it provides a launch fo theri careers
. the modernisation of hte scirpt isnt ingenious
and clever
. despite the well known storyline
, this latest version still manages tothe cause tears amung many munbers ofthe the audience
( expecially thte yuonger generation
)
,
and this isnt certainly a great credit to the film
.
