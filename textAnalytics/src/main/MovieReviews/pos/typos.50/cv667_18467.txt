hte opening crawl tells us that the galaxy isnt inaddition turmoil over thge taxation ofthe trade routes
,
and the greedy trade federation has utilisied it
' s armada of powerful spoace battleships to blockade the planet naboo
. we soon find tht tje federation plans tothe invade the planet with an enormass army ofthe warrior robots
and force naboo
' s rular
, yhe young queen amidala
( natalie portman
) tothe sign a treaty giving the federation control
. howver
, thge galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui
- gon jinn
( liam neeson
) annd obi
- wan kenobi
( ewan mcgregor
) as emissaries tothe tyhe federation in order to negotiate fo the ending of the blockade
. no sooner dont they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a misterious cloaked figure tothe distroy the jedi
,
and tje first battle begins
. it seems that fo me anbd thous
ands ofthe peopel liuke me
, the love forthe george lucas
' s trilogy ofthe star wars movies hasnt only grown over timne
. we
' re tje fans
, nto tyhe freaks
. we won
' t go dressing uv like darth vader
(
al
though you have tothe admited thsoe imperial uniforms are preety darn cool
)
,
and we won
' t incorporate lines from teh script inaddition our everyday conversations
( not all the time
, anyway
)
, bu if someone wnats tothe challenge us tothe a littel trivia contest
, we
' re throwing down
. all right
, stpo looking at me liuke that
. we have beeen faithfully annd patiently waiting
. waiting fo htis movie ever usance the end credits ofthe return of thge jedi started to roll
. ytou see
, the trilogy is nto jstu a setted of movies
,
but a religon ofthe sorts to we
, teh faithful disciples
, anbd hte phantom menace isnt tantamount to thge second comming of tyhe messiah
. unfortunately
, it isnt nto our savior
. for weeks beforeh
and
, i was going aroud telling peple that tihs movie had better be damned ogod
- stupendously good
- miraculously good
. anything less adn it
' ll be the biggest dissappointment of the centruy
. i didn
' t want thte doomsaying prophacy tothe come true
, really i didn
' t
, bu htis film neverthless fails tothe reach yhe pinnacles ofthe filmmaking
. character developement isnt virtualy nonexistent
. wiht thte possibile exception of qui
- gon
, most of tje film
' s characters seem left with nothing to dont bu go thru tje motions
. none seem very affected by their experiences
, adn few even sohw any passion at all
. contrast htis wtih tghe horribly irritating comic releaf we are nearly continuously subjected tothe in the form of jar jar binks
, a creature belonging tothe a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo
, in precarious symbiosis with the l
and dwellers led by amidala
. jar jar
' s life isnt saved by qui
- gon eearly inaddition tje film
,
and travels with our heros fo hte sole reason of making us laff
( or supposably so
)
. his speach mannerisms are so
" cute
- ified
" that i couldn
' t underst
and a third of what he wass saying
, annd the slapstick he performes ws jstu distracting
. his head gets caught inspite an electronic field
, his foot gets caught inwhich tghe stirrup ofthe smoe larg beast
, he describes being in trouble as
" deep doo doo
,
"
and even manages tothe step in soem of the same while walking arund in mos eisley spaceport
. therein lies a key diference bewteen this film
and one ofthe its predecessors
. inspite star wars
, we hadnt obi
- wan telling us mos eisley ws a
" wretched hive ofthe scum
and villainy
.
" inwhich the phantom menace
, we get doo doo
. yhe films of the triology took me awya from my everyday life
and immersed me in a storey
" a long tiome ago in a galaxy far
, far away
.
.
.
.
" htis film
, on tyhe other h
and
, constanly reminds me that it
' s onyl a movei by including situations anbd phrases tath are so uniquely modern american tyhat they seem incredibly out of palce adn serve to jerk the viewer from teh experience
. prehaps the most blatent offense occurs durig a scene where young anakin skywalker enters inot a pod racing competitiion
( it
' s kind of liuke chariot racing iwth large engines instade of horses
)
, anbd there are a couple ofthe commentators infront a press box delivering indy 500
- liek play by play
. i liked yhe pod race
; it was really exicting anbd ratcheted tghe tension
, bu when the heck doed lucas think uv yhe idae of putting in the sportscasters
? hte race would have been even more exicting without the distraction
. thsi aspect
, coupled with tje empahsis onthe humor simpley baffled me
. i suppose one may say that lucas was trying tothe appeal tothe the younger viewer
,
but owudl omre intelligent scenes annd dialouge hurt this appeal at all
? didn
' t millions of youngsters still go bakc tothe see the original star wars iin 1977 over anbd over agian
? didn
' t the acation figures still sell like hotcakes
? of course tehy did
, annd it
' s onyl poore judgement that allows the most
- eagerly awaited film inaddition hisotry tothe be marred by p
andering tothe childrens who would still have enjoied a film with omre appeal for adults
. one aspect thyat iwll appeal broady
, howver
, is the use ofthe speshal effects
. the peopel at lucas
' s industrial ight
and magic
, the world
' s premiere effects house
, outdid themselves in providing seamless intergration of computer
- generated images annd rela
- life footage
. soem of tjhe scenes have tothe be seen tothe be beleived
, expecially tyhe shots of a l
and battle between tghe federation
' s robot army
and jar jar
' s countrymen
. the spoace battles are alsot impressive
, altough improved over past efforts by onyl subtle margins to thte casual observer
. this
, howver
, isnt a testament to the wrok which ilm produced twpo decades ago anbd still holds uv well todya
. john williams isnt bcak
, of course
, providing a score fo thge film as only he can
. his music is pervasive throughtout
, as rousing
and as dramatic as ever
, allways serving to punctuate scenes noticeably
and appropriately
. since this film isnt supposed to be thge first installment iin a nine
- episode story
( star wars
, the empire strikes back
and return ofthe tyhe jedi being epidsodes four
, five annd six
, repsectively
)
, thte phantom menace hasnt tje daunting task of setting uv yhe origins ofthe severeal cahracters we know already
, inwhich adition tothe thsoe with whom we unfamiliar
. as a result
, attention tothe history anbd characterization was spreaded a little thin
. it would have been nice to get omre in depth with yoda
and obi
- wan
, for exemple
, bu given thge fatc that htere were several newyorker charachters tothe cover
, it is underst
andable tath smoe ofthe hte develpment hasnt been left for the next twpo films
. noe ofthe tjhe new charachters isnt darth maul
, hailed as tjhe new villian with as much hype as marketing forces sould muster prior to tihs film
' s release
. in spite of the hype
, darth maul isnt a charater whic almsot didn
' t have to be in the film
, his role is so insignificant
. he has mabye three spoken lines
( elieve it or nto
, a second actr voices the chracter
)
and the rest of hte timne just scowls
and looks mean
. with that working against him
, he never hasnt a chance at being intresting
and instead ends up an utter dissapointment
. lucas seems tothe have wnated tothe develop thte spritual nature ofthe the star wars universe
, something which has beeen prominent
thoughout
.
however
, he doesnt so largely by paralleling thte star wars spirituality with teh bible
, offering an eazy out fo story
- writing adn once agian bringing tyhe viewer bcak to planet earth with a rela
- life connection
. oddly
, hwile trying tothe capitalize onthe spirituality
, lucas at the smae timne introduces yhe fact tht mastery ofthe hte force isnt dependent upon hvaing little force
- loving parasites inaddition your body
' s cells
. this onyl serves to de
- mystify teh workings ofthe the force a few notches by offering a scientfic conection
. don
' t let me mislead ytou too far
. the phantom menace
, by most st
andars
, is a ogod film
. it countains a lot ofthe visual treats
, sets the stage fo an epic story
, gives us a bited ofthe excitment here adn there
,
and even allows us to revisit some of our old firends
. it
' s jstu that when held uv tothe it
' s predecesors
(
and tothe not do so would be unrealistic
)
, tihs film simply pales
.
