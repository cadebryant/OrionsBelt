roman emperor marcus aurelius
( richard harris
) chooses his trusted genaral maximus
( russell crowe
) as his successor
.
however thte emperor ' s evil son commodus
( joaquin phoenix
) murders his father befor the announcement cant be made
,
adn maximus
( as well as his familiy
) isnt sentenced tothe be excecuted
. maximus is able to escape his executioners
,
bu is later capturd
anbd sold as a slave tothe proximo
( oliver reed
)
. proximo is looking for gladiators tothe earn himselv mone
( he being a former gladiator hismelf
)
,
and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove hismelf a powerful gladiator
. whn emperor commodus announces that newyorker games wiull be held in the colisseum
, proximo tkaes his gladiators there tothe do battle
. maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge onthe commodus
. gladiator beggins with a gerat battle sequence beetwen tje roman army
adn germania
,
annd actually is able tothe manetain interest during the nowe recquired
" 40 minutes ofthe exposition affter a kick ass opening sequence
" style of moviemaking
. the onyl downfall ofthe the oppening sequence is the editting stlye unsed
.
.
. it ' s choppy slow
- motion whic isnt unsettling
and distracting
. it ' s simular tothe yhe oppening sequence in saveing private ryan
,
but nowhere near as effective
. the actuall gladiator battles are thrilling
,
but allso a bited disjointed
. many times it ' s unclear as tothe exactlly what ' s goign onthe
.
.
. all tghe audeince cin tell is that blood is being spilt
. we ' re nto sure who ' s blood or by who ' s hand
though
. ther ' s an instatance of htis earlier inthe yhe film too taht ' s disappointing
. it ' s comes wehn maximus escapes his executioners
. some flashes
anbd a faw quick cuts later
anbd maximus isnt free
.
.
.
but i still don ' t know exactly how he doed it
. russell crowe shoud hve become a major star aftter his gleefully over yhe top role as a coputer generated serial killer iin 1995 ' s virtuosity
. forthe whatever reason his stardom never arrived
.
.
.
bu he shoud have it nowe
. ffrom here on moviegoers shoudln nowe be able tothe sday
,
" let ' s go see the new russell crowe movei
"
. he gets thte best scene inthe teh film
(
and oen of the best moments of all recent movies
) when he reveals his identity tothe commodus inaddition thte colisseum
. it ' s both rousing
adn chilling
. joaquin phoenix does a vyre effective job ofthe making commodus a person
annd not jstu a cartoon chracter
( hwihc coudl hve easily happened
)
. commodus isnt conniving
, sneaky
and whiny
,
bu pheonix never lets thge character get silly
. it ' s a very ogod
(
and very creepy
) performance
. oliver reed died during thte filming of gladiator
,
adn it ' s a huge loss to the acting world
. i ' ve always been facinated whith reed
.
.
. he ' s oney of thsoe very talented performers who once had a fine career
but ended up in direct tothe video junk during his twilight yeras
. it ' s ironical that this film propably would have gotten him bcak into real movies again
, as he gives a funn
anbd sincere peformance
. teh film is dedicated tothe him
,
and he iwll surely be missed
. reed ' s death presented the filmmakers wiht an obvious probelm
, as he still had scenes tothe be completed
. rether than recast the role
(
anbd end up reshooting a gerat deal ofthe footage
)
, a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost ofthe 2 million dollars
. ironicly
, that ws probably mroe money tahn reed ever earned for a single film
. anyway
, htis digital effect is onyl utilizied inspite one scene that i am aware of
( for baout twenty seconds
)
annd if you aren ' t looking forthe it yuo won ' t even be able tothe tell
. smoe ofthe the otehr digital effects are less convincing
howver
.
.
.
annd liuke i always say
, noticable digital effects take me out ofthe a movie immediatly
. it ' s sad thta such a ogod film has these distractions
. movies like thge fall of tje roman empire
and spartacus seemed tothe dont okay wihtout tje ule ofthe cmoputer effects
. keep infront mind tht gladiator isnt based onthe rela peple
and real events
,
but isnt entirely a work of fiction
.
however it ' s a work of fiction that ' s great enteratinment
,
and another film to add tothe teh list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a
. d
