but is later captured adn sold as a slave tothe proximo
( oliver reed
)
. proximo is looking forthe gladiators to earn hismelf mnoey
( he being a former gladiator hismelf
)
, adn maximus reluctantly uses his skills tothe prove himself a powerful gladiator
. when emperor commodus announces that newyorker ganes will be held in the colisseum
, proximo tkaes his gladiators there to dont battle
. maximus sees this as his chance to excact revenge on commodus
. gladiator beggins whith a great battle sequence beetwen tjhe roman army anbd germania
,
and acually is able to manetain interest durring hte now requred
" 40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence
" sytle ofthe moviemaking
. tyhe onyl downfall ofthe the opening sequence is the editing stlye used
.
.
. it
' s choppy slow
- motion whihc is unsettling
and distracting
. it
' s similair tothe the oppening sequence inspite saving private ryan
, bu nowhere near as effective
. tyhe actuall gladiator battles are thrilling
,
but alsot a bited disjointed
. many times it
' s unclear as tothe exactlly waht
' s oging onthe
.
.
. all yhe audience cant tell is that blood is being spilled
. we
' re not sure who
' s blood or by who
' s h
and
though
. there
' s an instatance ofthe this ealier in tje film too that
' s disappointing
. it
' s comes whn maximus escapes his executioners
. some flashes
and a few quick cuts later anbd maximus is free
.
.
. bu i still don
' t know exactly how he did it
. russell crowe shoudln ahve become a major star after his gleefully over tje top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995
' s virtuosity
. fo whatever reason his stardom never arrived
.
.
. bu he should haev it nowe
. ffrom here onthe moviegoers shoudl now be able tothe sday
,
" let
' s go see the newyorker russell crowe movie
"
. he gets the best scene inwhich the film
( anbd oney ofthe the best moments ofthe all receet movies
) when he reveals his identity tothe commodus in teh colisseum
. it
' s both rousing
and chilling
. joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person
and nto just a cartoon carachter
( whcih could have easily happened
)
. commodus is conniving
, sneaky anbd whiny
,
but pheonix never lets tje charactor get silly
. it
' s a vrey good
(
and very creepy
) performance
. oliver reed died durring the filming ofthe gladiator
, anbd it
' s a huge loss to tghe acting world
. i
' ve alwyas been facinated with reed
.
.
. he
' s one of thsoe vyre talented performers who once hadnt a fine career
but ended up infront direct tothe video junk during his twilight years
. it
' s ironical thgat this film probably owudl ahev gotten him bcak into real movies agian
, as he gives a funn adn sincere performence
. thge film is dedicated tothe him
, annd he iwll surely be missed
. reed
' s death presented yhe filmmakers with an obvious probelm
, as he still hadnt scenes to be completed
. rether tahn recast the role
(
and end uv reshooting a graet dael of footage
)
, a digital verison ofthe oliver reed wass creaeted at a reported cost ofthe 2 million dollars
. ironicaly
, that wass probably more moeny thna reed ever earned for a single film
. anyway
, this digital effect isnt only utilizied in one scene that i am aware of
( forthe about twenty seconds
)
and if yuo aren
' t looking for it ytou won
' t even be able to tell
. smoe of tjhe other digital effects are less convincing
however
.
.
. anbd liek i always say
, noticable digital effects tkae me outloud of a movei imediately
. it
' s sad that such a good film has theese distractions
. movies like tyhe fall ofthe tghe roman empire
and spartacus seemed to dont okay without the use ofthe computer effects
. keep in mind that gladiator is based onthe real people
and real events
, bu isnt entirely a wokr ofthe fiction
. howver it
' s a work ofthe fiction tht
' s great entertainment
,
and anyother film tothe add tothe tyhe list of damn fine flicks released infront 2000 a
