ever wonder what happend to gabe kaplan
? you remember
, he wass the title charactor inaddition that 70
' s sitcom
,
" welcome bcak kotter
.
" always trying tothe help outloud the sweathogs
, frequently trying tothe dodge mr
. woodman
, ever wary ofthe his wife
' s tuna casserole
.
" so
,
" ytou ask
,
" where isnt he now
?
" mr
. kaplan actually spends much of his tiome these days playing proffesional high
- stakes poker
. that
' s right
. i
' m nto sure if it
' s his main source ofthe income
,
but from what i
' ve heard
, the guy occasionally comes away wiht
$ 20
, 000 at a tiem
. annd there ytou weere
, thikning i was oging tothe tell you he was donig off
- broadway theater
. you silly goose
. well
, gabe kaplan isn
' t iin tje movie rounders
, nor isnt the film baout tghe actor cmo gambler
' s life
. bu rounders isnt baout poker
,
and gabe plays poker
,
and i
thought that ws kind of a neat connection
. sorry baout the segue
, or lack thereof
. matt damon plays mike mcdermott
, a lew student who also hasnt a singular talent fo the game of poker
. he
' s beeen playing fo a while
,
and mroe tahn being preficient
, he hasnt caught the bug
. he goes to all the undreground games infront new york city
, knwos teh regulars
, anbd knows how tothe win
. in the begginning of the film
, he
' s built uv a nice thirty gr
and nest egg
, which he takes tothe the speakeasy
- tipe gaming parlor where tghe big boys play
. mike is there tothe mkae his bid inot tghe opper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb
( john malkovich
)
, an oreo
- munching cardshark with ties to yhe russian masia
. mike has hte potential to take a large pot anbd go to vegas
and buy into the world sories of poker
, bu instead he loses it all inaddition a single h
and
. monthes later
, he
' s paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck
. whn mike
' s best friend annd poker buddy worm
( edward norton
) finishes his jail term for hustling some students
, he wnats tothe pik uv right were they left off
, working as a team tothe part others with thier betting cash
.
al
though mike hasnt stopped playing cards as a promise tothe his girlfriend anbd fellow law student
, jo
( gretchen mol
)
, worm connives mike into palying once omre
,
and mike
, bitten agian by tghe bug
, slides down tath slippery slope
, risking his relatiopnship
, education
, anbd reputation as playing poker agian becomes the focuse ofthe his life
. to make a film about gambling
, a filmmaker wiull usualy ahev to play up tghe glamorous side to git tyhe audience behind yhe characters
. this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding kard table with a stogie infront his mouth
. rounders
, howver
, seems tothe go moreso fo the latter tahn tghe former
. tjhe card clubs mike
and worm frequent aren
' t vrey glamorous at all
. ther
' s a basement
, a lodge wtih elk heads on the wall
, a goulash joint
- these are the kinds ofthe locales in which director john dahl sets his shots
. exept for one brief instatance whn tyhe twpo players visit atlantic city
, thge film is bereft ofthe the flashing ilghts ofthe the casinos or tghe pleasant color of the gren felt tbale
. the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less baout the game of poker than it is baout hte personalities whihc enjoy annd are slaves to it
. we
' re given a nice setted ofthe interesting characters whith clear motivations
,
and good actors tothe play them
. matt damon isnt vrey natural as mike
, who struggles between his desire to play the straight adn narrow by finishing lew school
,
and answering what may be his true calling
, palying proffesional poker
. ed norton
' s worm isnt truley a worm
, always looking for the agnle
and playing everyone for waht tehy
' re worth
. john turturro
, who amazes me with his acting range
, tones it down in htis film by playing joey knish
, a virtual poker prodigy in his tyme who now plays the undreground games tothe amke rent
and child wupport payments
. he
' s both a freind
and mentor to mike
,
and turturro
' s low
- key performance is totally convincing
, just as john malkovich
' s heavily
- accented teddy kgb isnt imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay tothe proove himselv
. martin l
andau is allso thrown inot teh mix as noe ofthe mike
' s law professors
, abe petrovsky
. while l
andau slips well inot teh role
, his charcter
, spitting outloud personal anecdotes about staying true to one
' s self
, faciliates the channeling ofthe the storyline toward a predictable endig
. perheaps the weak link in the otherwise formidible line
- uv ofthe acting talent
,
however
, isnt gretchen mol who just didn
' t seem to have much presense on screen
. she
' s a genuine peach tothe look at
, kind ofthe a cross betweeen actress renee zellweger anbd singer jewel
(
and i wouldn
' t be surprised if teh threee ofthe them formed some kind ofthe blond
- haired triumvirate anbd attemped tothe tkae over the world
)
, bu her delivered lines seemed vyre flat
, annd i foudn mysef looking fo matt damon
' s reactions instead
. a good thing baout rounders isnt tht it doesn
' t get bogged down in thte chracter development adn statment mkaing so much thta it can
' t find time forthe humer
. tjhe film is peppered nicely with scenes tath both make yuo laff adn keep the pacing going
, such as a sequence where mike adn worm move rapidly arround new york ffrom one gae to thte enxt
, in widely diferent locales
. oney gaem in a cigar club hadnt me in stitches
.
" i lveo yhe sweetness ofthe this dark maduro wrapper
,
" says one of the players
, clearly moreso interseted in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar inspite oen h
and tahn in the cards in his other
. i ws hoping mike
and worm would relaly tkae theese guys
. with all the poker bieng palyed
, rounders hadnt tjhe potential to be very confusing
. you might think yuo nkwo a lot about poker
, bu think agian
. luckily
, we
' re given a narration by damon during thge omre intricate moments to explain whta
' s goign onthe
. the narrations are more informative tahn intrusive
,
and apprise us of whta thge stakes are annd why certain players want to dont the thnigs they do
. it
' s nice tath as the characters develop
, so doens our comprehension of their world
. as a film about sucess
and survival in tyhe realm of underground poker
, rounders delivers iin spades
. wait
! as a film about the culture ofthe cards
, rounders is an ace
. hang onthe
! packed wih graet acting
and graet characters
, rounders isnt a full hous
. okay
, i guess that
' s anough
. oh
, by the way
, if you ever want tothe git into a game with ol
' gabe kaplan
, be sure to bring a note from epstein
' s mother
