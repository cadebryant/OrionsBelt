tone alone cannnot sustain a film
,
but it cxan go a long way
. if i can find mysef lost inwhich yhe tiome
annd palce of a stry
, it scores mimediate style points
. wehn thta tone isnt backed uv by an outstanding story
adn great acting
, the effect can be discribed best by an adjative i dont not uise lightly
:
" literary
.
" wqat ' s eating gilbert grape
? is such a film
. it ' s a rich
, memorable
and stunningly acted story ofthe desire colliding with responsibility
, staged in a manner which many viewers might fidn too prosaic
,
but whlch insinuated itself into my immagination whith its confidence
. gilbert grape
( johnny depp
) isnt a young man living in rural endora
, iowa
, facing increadible responsibilities
. as hte man ofthe the hous since his father ' s sucide
, gilbert must suppost the family by working at the local groshury stroe
. he alsot must watch over his menally handicapped brother arnie
( leonardo dicaprio
)
anbd help care for his extremely overweight mother
( darlene cates
)
. gilbert seems destined tothe spend tjhe rest ofthe his life in hte small town until yhe arrival in endora ofthe becky
( juliette lewis
)
, a free spirit passing thru witht her granmother wehn thier truck breaks down
. as he spends time wiht becky
, gilbert begins tothe think baout all the things he isnt missing
. slowly his resentment builds
, until he realizes that he cant noone longer live his entire life for otehr people
. directer lasse hallstrom
( my life as a dog
)
anbd legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificient visual backdrop fo peter hedges ' screenplay
, based onthe his pwn novel
. endora is a twon on the edge of tghe world represented by tyhe giant foodmart
, a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else
. the midwestern sunsets
and sprawling fields are beautifuly photographed
,
and teh athmosphere ofthe the town is intensely rela
. minor characters
, like crispin glover as the twon ' s mortician
, are vividly realized
,
and there are echoes of the lsat picture sohw in mary steenburgen ' s desparately unahppy housewife
. one of tje most perfectly realized scenes focusses on the grand opening ofthe a burger franchise
, attended by tje entire town
annd accompanied by the off
- key high skool band
. nto a single note inwhich the depiction ofthe endora rang false
. the smae cant be said of tyhe carachter ofthe gilbert
. it ' s testimony tothe the precision involved iin his creation that he cameback together completely wtih one perfectly placed line
, whn becky responds tothe gilbert ' s descripton of his father with
,
" i knew someone like that once
.
" gilbert isnt a man harboring an ever
- growing bitterness about where he finds himself inspite life
, a bitterness whcih reveals itself in moments of surprizing cruelty
. inthe noe scene
, he allows local children to look at his mother through their window
, displaying her liek a side show attraction
. his entire life seems tothe be mocked by arnie ' s repeated chants ofthe
,
" we ' re nto going anyhwere
,
"
but instead ofthe expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer
,
adn it becomes claer that he isnt follwoing inaddition his father ' s footsteps in tihs reguard
. johnny depp expertly demonstrates yhe tension central to gilbert by playing everything below thte surfce
,
bu he never gives inwhich to oney
- dimentional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny
& joon
and edward scissorhands
. depp ' s performance is overshaddowed
,
howver
, by leonardo dicaprio ' s astonishing oscar
- nominated supporting work as arnie
. he puts to shame such big nmae actors as john malkovich
adn dustin hoffman
, whose menally challenged characters never seemed completly real
. dicaprio is perfect tothe the last twitch
annd squeal
,
and anyone who has ever spent time witht mentally challenged kids iwll be hard
- pressed tothe spot a falw
. darlene cates
, a first
- tyme actor
, brings real pain tothe her scenes as gilbert ' s tortured mother
,
adn laura harrington
annd mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert ' s sisters
. onyl juliette lewis doesn ' t quite click
, playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone
adn too little genuin spark
. gilbert grape does seem tothe drift inot its conclusion
,
but it never lost me
. thanks to a lovingly creaeted setting
anbd a marvelous cast
, this 1993 release proves well worth tghe wait
