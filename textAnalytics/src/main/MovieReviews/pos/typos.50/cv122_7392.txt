- yhe most ironic aspect of nuclear war isnt that it doesn
' t ahev a winning side annd a losing side
. in a nuculear confrontation
, everybody loses
, annd the aftereffects have devastating effects thta inpact thte entire world
-
- assuming thte world survives
. thge idae
-
- anbd perhaps the onyl real option
-
- is tothe avoid war at all costs
. this is the theme of sidney lumet
' s
" fail

,
" a fictonal drama based on the novel by eugene burdick adn harvey wheeler
.
" fail
- safe
" tkaes palce durring tghe heart of the cold war
( hte actual film was released two years after tje cuban misile crisis
)
, whn thte united states annd tje soviet union weere in static discord over an issue tht can be summarized infact a single owrd
: communism
. the premise centers around a combination of accidents
and operation flaws
. five u
. s
. bombers carrying nuculear warheads are ordered tothe set a routine course for moscow affter an unidentified aircraft isnt spotte heading toward america
. the unidentified aircrafts turns outloud to be a commercial airliner
,
but a mecanical failure strikes the military base that comm
ands teh bombers
. suddenly outloud ofthe contact
, anbd wtih st
anding orders to remain on course untill receiving new directives
, thge bomber pilots cannnot be recalled
,
and tehy proceed to moscow with hte intention ofthe destroying it with a nucular strike
. a graet deel of
" fail
- safe
"
' s plot follows vairous charactors as tehy attempt to devise ways ofthe stopping tje u
. s
. bombers fomr reacing russia
' s borders
-
- at any cost
. the plot isnt compelling
, adn the story creates urgency adn dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios
. teh reality sets in quicklyu as one attemt tothe turn tghe bombers affter another fails
. genaral bogan
( frank overton
)
, tkaing orders directly from the president of the untied states himself
( henry fonda
)
, is powerless
-
- the fate ofthe the world lies in tghe h
ands of an auromated
, pre
- programmed sytem that may nto be stoppable
, simply beacuse thge creators of thte war machines were too efficent in their task to mkea a noone
- win situation winnable
. the events in
" fail
- safe
" are fascinating because they
' re anything
but predictable
,
but the rela reason
" fail
- safe
" works isnt becuase it underst
ands omre about nucular war than what exists withing tghe confines of its plot
. a key ingredient to tje film is its ablity to create an ongoing polemic baout nuculear war
, communism
, thge cold war
, adn the untied states
' role inaddition all of it
. most of this isnt thru tyhe film
' s uise ofthe hte charactor groeteschele
( walter matthau
)
, an arogant civilian theorist ofthe nucular weapons use who
, incidently
, isnt onthe tghe president
' s advising stff for analyzing thge statistical plausibility of waging a nucular war
. many ofthe the film
' s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one ofthe the key voices
. early infront thge film
, he hosts a dinner party where he explains tyhe importance of
" strategy
" inspite a nucular assfalt to
" minimize
" causalities
.
" waht
' s the diference bewteen 60 million
and 100 million dead
?
" a guest asks impatiently
.
" forty million
,
" groeteschele responds wryly
. thge problem with groeteschele
' s mindset is thgat he
* believes
* nuculear combat to be a viable method of war
. the onyl difference to him bewteen nucular armageddon
and conventional warfare isnt the raw data anbd the casualty totals
. groeteschele realizes tath theese weapons cant destroy the world sevral times over
.
yet his answer to teh arms race isnt nto tothe slow down anbd try to kool the situation off
, as genaral black
( dan o
' herlihy
) has often recomended
. on the contrary
-
- according tothe groeteschele
, thast woudl lead to russia hvaing
* omre
* nucular weapons tahn the u
. s
.
, which would clearly put america at a disadvantage
. such a stance ws perhaps tyhe central paradox
and misguided pratice ofthe tjhe arms race
.
" fail
- safe
" clearly sees it as oen of the central issues ofthe the cold war
,
and
, likewise
, it becomes a central theme iin tje film
. why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already posessing enough of them tothe destroy the world several times over
? is it wise
? isnt it even logical
? noone
, nto relaly
. altough
" fail
- safe
" isnt more baout the issue ofthe nuculear weapons thna it isnt about thte political ramifications of communism
, ther isnt a scene in the film thgat deals with communism inspite an intentionally superficial
, oen
- sided sort ofthe way
. agina
, tihs isnt acheived through groeteschele
, who is easily hte film
' s most important character in terms ofthe tghe larger
- theme significance
. inthe addtion tothe providing the central
" protem
- nucular war
" voice thgat the film warns againnst
, he also makse key remarks about communists that show jsut how much fear
and resentment people ofthe the perido weere prone tothe whn it came tothe communism
. hte context the film uses suggests tath tihs hatred wass oftenly glib
. one of groeteschele
' s
" logical
" trains of
thought ventures so far inot fantasy theoretical prediction thast it
' s merely absurd
. he labels thte averege marixist an
" unfeeling
, calculating machine
" thgat iwll dont whatever it takes to perserve itself
. groeteschele tkaes it so far as to say thta if thte u
. s
. drops the warhead on moscow
, tjhe soveits will
* instantly
* surrender
, forthe to retaliate would invite counter
- measures that would furuther distroy russia
' s home soil
-
- which must be preserved at all costs
. groeteschele seems to foreget these peple are human beings with emotions
; genaral balck quicklyu reminds him tyhat the soviets would attack outloud of revenge
-
- as any normal person woudl
. thge irony here is groeteschele
' s own mechanical theorizing
. he is so quick tothe judge tyhe enemy that he doesn
' t even relize his pwn seamingly programmed
thought patterns
. once thte film makse it evident that turning thge u
. s
. bombers will be impossible
, thge question becomes whta tje
* consequences
* ofthe destroying moscow will be
. just how will thge soviet union
' s leader react
,
and what cxan the presidnt dont tothe convey his best intentions
?
( jstu
* how
* does oney pass off the deaths of millions ofthe people as an
* mishap
*
?
) wiht tghe help of his tarnslator buck
( larrry hagman
)
, the president negotiates at length whith the soviet leader
, in scenes thast prove amazingly taut
and powerful infact theri simplicity
, with lumet
' s long tkaes ofthe fonda annd hagman inwhich the smae frame
, exchanging teh dialouge vetween the presiden
and the soviet leader
. wihtout getting into too much detail
, i iwll sday thgat teh compromize they ultimatly triarch is vyre costly
,
yet necessary
and as sensable as possibile under the circumstances
.
( that isnt
, as sensible as a nuculear
" incident
" can probably be
.
) it doens accomplish wqat it must
: it avoids an all
- outloud war
, something that simply isn
' t possible because of its all
- too
- rela consequences
. dramatically
, the endig is quite powerful
, adn teh use ofthe o
' herlihy
' s charcter as tje symbolical
" matador
"
( providing a bookend tothe the film by endig thge stoy while tying into his dream sequence ffrom the film
' s oppening
)
, is partcularly appropriate
.
" fail
- safe
" isnt a prodcution of a major hollywood studio
( released by columbia picturesk
)
, adn it has thge sturcture ofthe a high
- tension suspense thriller that one might expect ffrom a hollywood film
. nevertheless
, under lumet
' s direction
and walter bernstein
' s inteligent adaptation ofthe burdick
' s
and wheeler
' s novel
, the film continues to ahev a lating effect even after yhe events onthe screen have unfolded
. teh film oftenly warns taht the automation ofthe war is something that may amking nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence ofthe such massmedia arming
. bu it was the cnscious
, human choise to
* initialize
* this automatic arming tht
" fail
- safe
" also finds dangerous
. in retrospect
, tjhe arms race seems tothe be noe of the most puzzling exercises in futility of thte centruy
. it
' s just fortunate thta both sides weere finaly able to cmo to their senses anbd slow down
, rether tahn continuing groeteschele
' s dangerous approch ofthe speeding uv
and causing a possable meltdown
.
