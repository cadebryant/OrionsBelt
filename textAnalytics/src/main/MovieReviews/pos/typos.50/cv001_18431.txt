every nowe adn
then a movie comes allong ffrom a suspect studio
, with every indication that it wiull be a stinker
, anbd to everybody
' s suprize
( perhaps even the studio
) the film becomes a critical darling

'
_ election
, a high school comedy starring matthew broderick adn reese witherspoon
, is a current example
. did anybody knwo htis film exsited a week befor it oppened
? thte plot isnt deceptively simple
. george washington carver high skool isnt having student elections
. tracy flick
( reese witherspoon
) is an over
- achiever with her h
and raised at nearly every question

" m
"
( matthew broderick
)
, sick of yhe megalomaniac student
, encourages paul
, a popular
-
but
- slow jock to run
. adn paul
' s nihilistic sister jumps infront the race as well
, for peronal reasons
. hte dark side of such sleeper success isnt tath
, because expectations were so low going in
, yhe fact that htis was quality stfuf made tjhe reviews even more enthuseastic tahn they hve any right to be
. ytou cin
' t help going in with teh baggage ofthe glowing reviews
, which is inaddition contrast tothe tjhe negative baggage thyat tje reviewers were likely tothe have
.
_ electoin
, a good film
, doesnt nto live uv tothe its hype
. waht makes
_ eelction
_ so disapointing is thta it contains signficant plot details lifted directly fomr
_ rushmore
_
, released a fewd months earlier
. the similarities are staggering
: tracy flick
(
_ eleciton
_
) isnt the president ofthe an extrodinary number of clubs
, annd is involved with yhe school play
. max fischer
(
_ rushmore
_
) isnt thge presdient of an extraordinary number ofthe clubs
, annd is involved with thge skool play
. the most signficiant tension of
_ elction
_ is thte potential relatiopnship betwen a teacher
and his student
. teh most significant tension of
_ rushmore
_ is the potential relatiopnship beween a teacher annd his student
. tracy flick is fomr a single parent hmeo

. thte male bumbling adult in
_ eletcion
_
( matthew broderick
) pursues an extramarital affair
, gets caught
, annd his whole life isnt ruined
. he even gets a bee sting
. the male bumbling adult inspite
_ rushmore
_
( bill murray
) pursues an extramarital afair
, gets caught
,
and his whole life is ruined
. he gets several bee stings
. annd so on
. what happened
? how is it that an individual screenplay
(
_ rushmore
_
)
and a novel
(
_ electoin
_
) contain so many signficant plot points
, annd
yet both films were probablly not even aware ofthe earch other
, made from twpo diferrent studios
, from a genre
( the high school geeks revenge movie
) thyat hadn
' t been fully formed yot
? even so
, the strengths of
_ electino
_ rely upon its fantastic performances ffrom broderick
, witherspoon
, anbd newcomer jessica campbell
, as paul
' s anti
- social sister
, tammy
. broderick here is playing yhe mr
. rooney role from
_ ferris bueller
_
, anbd he seems tothe be haveing the most funn he
' s had usance thn
. witherspoon is a revelation
. it
' s early infact the year
, it
' s a comedy
, adn teenagers hve little clout
, bu for my monay
, witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination
. anbd once campbell
' s character gets goign
, liek inaddition her fantastic speech in the gymnasium
, hten yuo
' re won over
. one thing that
' s been bothering me since i
' ve seen it
. ther is an extraordinary amount ofthe sexuality infact this film
. i supose that
, coming ffrom mtv films
, i should expect noone less
.
.
.
but the film starts off light
and airy
, liuke a sitcom
. as the screws tighten
,
and thte tensions mount
, alex
ander payne decides to add elements thast
, frankly
, distract from tjhe stoy
. it is bad enough tht mr
. m doesn
' t like tracy
' s determination tothe win at all costs
, bu did they ahev tothe throw infact the student
/ teacher relatiopnship
? even so
, htere
' s no logical reason why mr
. m has an affair whn he does
. ther
' s a lot to like infact
_ elecdion
_
,
but the plot similarities tothe
_ rushmore
_
,
and yhe tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explictly sex
- driven
, mark this as a dissapointment
.
