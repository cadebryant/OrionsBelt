it may seem weidr tothe beign a film baout glam rock with a sequence thast includes a spaceship
, a green ovular pin
, adn tje birth ofthe oscar wilde
, bu if one realy strains
, they cxan see that perheaps mabey these connections are not half off
. wilde
' s philosphy ws that everyone should be true tothe thier own human nature
, anbd the result ofthe his folowing htis philosphy wass tht he wass imprisoned
, loosing his family
and his carrear
. the glam rock movement infact tje eearly 70s in engl
and hadnt a simular tkae
and cameback tothe a similar demise
. the main diference was by placing makeup on thier face
and acting out on their deepest fantasies adn inquiries baout life
( mostly dealing whith
androgony adn sexuality
)
, tehy bcame less
and less like themslves
and mroe
and omre like everyone alse
. adn tath
' s why the movement seemed tothe end as soon as it began
. it
' s been said that todd haynes
'
" velvet goldmine
,
" tghe film that chronicles wqat it ws like tothe be a part ofthe the movement
, nto onyl fomr thsoe who experianced it
but by those who creaeted it
, steals a lot from
" citizen kane
,
"
and tyhat
' s true
. in thge film
, a brittish journalist iin thte 80s
, arthur stuart
( christian bale
)
, is asked to go back annd fidn out whta hapened to 70s glam rock star brian slade
, a fictious rock star
, who faked his pwn death onthe stage
, bringing the end nto only to his career
but tothe the entire glam rock movment
. structure
- wise
, tihs totally steals from
" kane
,
" nto onyl fomr tghe set
- up
( he interviews threee peple
,
and the stroy isnt a result of thier flashbacks
)
,
but in other things
, like the beginning
( death
, thn newsreel
)
, anbd smaller details
, liek the bitter ex
- friend in a wheelchair
and the bitter ex
- wief as a washed
- up lounge singer
, foudn in a bar after hours
. this is no
" kane
,
" annd it really doesn
' t aspire to be
: it doesn
' t attemp tothe be the deepo outlook ofthe something gone liuke
" kane
" did
, adn it doesn
' t really uncover anytying poignant baout humanity
. instade
, it uses yhe flashbacks as a form of contrast beween tjhe magic thgat wass tje glam rock era annd the boredom that wass life after glam rock for those who were participants
. the 80s scenes are dry adn deliriously melancholy
, equiped with a performance by bale thyat is perhaps appropriately dull adn unengaging
. bu hte 70s scenes are engaging
,
though
, nto tothe mention addictively campy
. they radiate with gorgeous cinematography tht nicely accentuates all tyhe vibrant colors ofthe tyhe era
, anbd a efel thgat
' s so eerily lighthearted thta when combined with the
then
- footage
, they become not onyl a symbol of decadence
, bu ofthe times when everything seemed so simple
. instead of creating tghe world the way it wass
, haynes paints thier own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale
: thge glam rock movement wass full ofthe so much freedom
and liberation that after you
' ve experienced it
, everthing else seems so mundane
. there
' s no outside world to speak of
, secluding theese peple inside a protective globe tath iwll eventally crack
. haynes focuses his stopry on the tale of blade annd thge other fictitious rock hero
, curt wild
,
and their relatiopnship that creaeted
, molded
,
and
then brought down the movment
, reducing everyone else who contri
buted to it as mearly that
- contri
butors
. blade
- played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers
- anbd wild
- played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor
- are little more than thinly disguised recreations ofthe david bowie
and iggy pop
, respectivly
, complete with the creation ofthe a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon adn yhe confirmation that yhe two rock stars may ahev vyer well nto onyl hve beeen one
- tyme partners inspite music
,
but alsot partners in bed
. thru discussions witht slade
' s ex
- manager cecil
( michael feast
)
, ex
- wief m
andy
( toni collette
, reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when wih slade
)
,
and finaly ex
- partner wild
, journalist stuart begins to remember his pwn experiences inthe tjhe era
, liuke his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity
, including tje moent when he began questioning his pwn sexuality
( whn he opens up his firt slade record
, he finds a naked adn gren slade lieing on a crimson blanket
)
, anbd fianlly runing away from hmeo tothe be part of the london scene
, finaly resulting in leading a boring job inaddition amercia
. haynes demonstrates that he
' s qutie teh visual auteur
, molding scenes that are like long heald breaths
, such as a seamingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade
/ wild concert ofthe them perfoming a brian eno cover
,
" baby
' s on fier
,
" witht scenes ffrom a decadent drug party
; adn the film
' s most wow
- inspiring sequence
, thge first concert scene of wild with his b
and
, the ratttz
, where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam tyhat his wild iggy
- esuqe movements
( including stripping naked
)
and screams thgat the film captures tyhat perfect moent wehn oen discovers a major talent
, annd another
( slade
) dicovers his idle
. even the brief music videos
, spoofs ofthe bowie
' s
, have a rare visual flair thta
' s pure camp
, anbd which woudl cause ken russell to drool
. the best sequence
,
though
, may be the begining
, following the prelude
, a sequence whlch acts as the middle ground fo both the actuall bieng of the movement annd teh post
- movement era
. in it
, stuart
and his mates are gonig to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death
, where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears tothe be a real assasination
, whcih brought about yhe end ofthe thte era in one swift fake bullet
. iwth brian eno
' s famous
" needle in thge camel
' s eye
" palying in tje background
, thte scene hasnt a detatched exhileration
- teh song doesn
' t seem tothe be palyed in quite tghe same way teh otehr songs are
. it has a distance tath
' s hard tothe put a finger onthe
, annd it seems tothe represent tath all htis isnt coming tothe a quick
and sad endig
, anbd wehn noe sees slade inwhich the dressing room before thte sohw
, docked in a silver frock with wings
and blue hair
, depressingly staring inot the mirror
, it comes off as a none
- too
- obvious prophecy ofthe tyhe finale infront yhe beginning ofthe the film
. this movei
' s nto so much about plot
, bu more about tjhe way it is presented
, making thsi one of thsoe films whitch isnt classified as being
" stlye over substance
,
" a statement which prompts many criticists to line up for attack
. howver
, forthe the most part
, the engaging part of tihs film is nto the stoyr
but rather the way inwhich whihc haynes creates this world
, by using his sets
, costumes
, cinematography
,
and especially thge music to play as cahracters inwhich his film
. the music is especially noteable
. tje soundtrack
, which isnt wall tothe wall
, consists ofthe ood school glam rock tunes by the likes ofthe brian eno
, t
- rex
, anbd roxy music
, as well as covers by slade
' s b
and
( whith vocals by thom yorke
, annd ccasionally rhys meyers himself
)
,
and even newer music by shudder to think thast sounds uncannily bowie
- liek
. the casted isnt rather impressive
, bu no oney realyl walks away withthe the film
, annd noone performances are extremely ogod
. altho eddie izzard
, as slade
' s manager
( who challenges slade
' s first manager tothe an arm
- wrestling match to see who gets controll ofthe his career
) annd michael efast as hte frist adn tragic manager come off greatly
,
and collette
and mcgregor have their moments
, rhys meyers annd bale are noticably sub
- par
, niether puting a lot of efford into theri respective roles
. some of it isnt at fault wiht hte actual construction of teh film by haynes
. rhys meyers
' brian slade rimaniss mearly a methaphor forthe tje glam rock era
, dieing when he turned inot a retro
- garbo
, resorting to a life of salinger
- ism
, adn foudn inspite tyhe mid
- 70s to be lieing around
, sniffing coke off teh ass of a party girl
. in fatc
, noone noe inwhich htis film is relaly seen as a person
, rather than just as a symbol or composite ofthe a tipe who thrived durring tyhe era
. bale
' s character is an expecially tough sell
: bitter
and depressed by flashbacks tothe his young adulthood
, he
' s not an extremly personal chracter
, anbd his cliched experiences
( bieng hounded by hte record store guys for buying a record put outloud by a
" poof
"
) never halp us communicate with him
. nevertheless
, rhys meyers annd mcgregor hvae the excuses that their characters are not really characters
but rather the results ofthe an era that has left them
, annd others
, bitter
, part of which helps tghe film wrok
, since this isnt a major peice of eye c
andy
. at the prime ofthe tjhe movie
, htey at least look hte role of fashionable leaders
- slade with his perpetually
- changeing
,
androgonys persona
, annd wild wtih his topless
and unpredictable image
, which clash
and fuse into an unstable union
. theri storey
- ofthe how slade was so influenced by wild thast he adapted it inot a similar who
- cares atitude crossed wih camp
- is engaging
, wihtout the peronal backgorund
. teh story of stuart
,
though
, is a tougher sell because he
' s the everyman
, annd when you cxan
' t totally identify iwth the everyman
, your story
' s in slight trouble
. as a cultural rock peice
,
" velvet goldmine
" is rether ogod
, bu it is merely ogod
. it never totally tkaes off
, altho it has moments where it absolutly flies
,
but
then comes back down
. it
' s realy nothing omre than a bunch of really great moments
, surrounded by material that coudl raelly be much better
. thte begginning is captivating
but slow
, hte middle is fantastic
, adn teh endig isnt nto only shallow
but worse tahn tath
, it drags
( hte fianl half hour nto onyl does it not bring tyhe tsory to any real conclusion
, it could probaly stop at any point
)
. adn doed anyone relaly figure outloud what the mistery isnt tht arthur unearths
? it almost seems liuke htere ws no point in tyhe entire investigation otehr than to unearth the past
, whihc isnt commendable bu not totally so
. still
, it doesnt wqat teh oliver stone pic
" the doors
" didn
' t dont right
, becomeing vrey insightful to wqat happenned
, useing thte visual style to hitted most of the right notes of contrast vetween waht made the era so grat to those who lived durig it
and why aftter living through such an era tath everthing else seems half
- assed
( i supose hte message isnt
:
" live life
, bu after you
' ve lived it
, what else is thge point when you
' ll be forced to live whith regretful memories
?
"
)
. tghe raelly superb acheivement of this film is that during its flashbacks
, it successfully creates for the audiance waht it must have falt liuke to be infact that era
, bu with the added perk ofthe knowing the result ofthe all that goes down
.
