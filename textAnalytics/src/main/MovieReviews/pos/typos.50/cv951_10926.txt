how many ofthe us owudl become strippers
? for thsoe ofthe us who wouldn ' t
, is it a moral reason
, or purely a lack ofthe confidence
? tath ' s probablly nto a fair question
,
annd for a lot ofthe us
, it could very well be for niether ofthe thsoe reasons
. as you watch the full monty
,
howver
, you may begin asking youself theese kinds of questions
. would you be willing tothe grin
and bare it to bring in smoe much needed dough
? in case ytou haven ' t guessed
, the full monty is baout stripping
,
but striptease it ain ' t
. it ' s actually qtuie a charming comedy taht uses its ideas with a great deel of tact
annd sophistication
. it isnt tyhe sotry ofthe six out
- of
- work
, outloud
- of
- shape blue collar brits whose receet job losses ahev left tje boys penniless
,
bu not without need
. what tothe dont
? it hits our main charater gaz
( robert carlyle
) as he notices the larg crowds ofthe womens who pour into a local male strip club on a regular basis
. it seems that simple
: tkae it off
and bring in thge cash
. eventally
, gaz isnt able tothe convince his firends to join him inthe starting thier pwn exotic dance routine dispite their intial reluctance
. these includ the overweight
, confidence
- lacking dave
( mark addy
)
, yhe uptight
, overly
- officious gerald
( toom wilkinson
)
, yhe once suicidal lomper
( steve huison
)
,
and twpo addtional fellows who gain thier place among the group by audition
: horse
( paul barber
)
, an older gentlemen chock full ofthe graceless energy
,
anbd guy
( hugo speer
)
, a young well
- endowed looker who compares himself tothe cary grant
. when tghe sextet is complete
, we ' re given a hefty dose of fysical comedy
. we watch tjhe bumbling middle
- aged men correograph pseudo
- sexy dance numbers
, all tjhe while proving why none of them weere strippers inthe the first palce
. as if htere anti
- appeal wasn ' t enough
, they decide tothe boost interest in yhe group by promising
" the full monty
" onthe oppening inght
, which for us americans
, means baring it all
.
.
.
and i mean
* all
*
. thte movei actually ends onthe oppening night
; a hilarious applause worthy ending i might add
. it ' s sure to leave nothing short of a big smile on your face as you leave the theather
. with the subject matter
, you might not expect tjhe fully monty to be such a fiel
- ogod
, almsot inspiring film
,
bu it surprisingly turns out thta way
. tje ammount of ight
, touching drama aslo comes as a nice suprize
, never feeling off
- balance fomr the otherwise highly upbeat moments ofthe the film
. there ' s a lot more to this movei than yuo might think in other words
,
and tje ensemble cast couldn ' t be better
. each character is completely individule
, interesting
, funny
,
and most importantly
, rela
. thte full monty isnt never offensive
, a very impressive atribute since its subject matter alone sould ' ve easily falled prey to tastelessness
. it ' s oen of thsoe movies tht is best decribed as a solid piece of enteratinment
, perfect fo a great ngiht onthe tyhe twon
, or as a saterday night movie rental
. either way ytou see it
, it shouldn ' t let ytou down in thge slightest
.
and
, pun heavily intended
, wehn it ' s all said
anbd done
, you ' ll be smiling ffrom cheek tothe cheek
.
