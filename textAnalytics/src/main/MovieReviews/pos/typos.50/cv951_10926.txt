? it hits our main character gaz
( robert carlyle
) as he notices yhe large crowds of women who pour inot a local male strip club onthe a regluar basis
. it seems that simple
: tkae it off adn bring in the cash
. eventally
, gaz isnt able tothe convince his firends tothe join him in starting thier own exotic dance routine dispite their inital reluctance
. theese include thge overweight
, confidence
- lacking dave
( mark addy
)
, the uptight
, overly
- officious gerald
( toom wilkinson
)
, tghe once suicidal lomper
( steve huison
)
, adn two additional fellows who gain theri palce among tyhe gropu by audition

, an older gentlemen chock full of graceless energy
, annd guy
( hugo speer
)
, a young well
- endowed looker who compares himself to cary grant
. when the sextet is complet
, we
' re given a hefty dose ofthe fysical comedy
. we watch the bumbling middle
- aged men correograph pseudo
- sexy dance numbers
, all the while proving why none of them were strippers inspite the first place
. as if there anti
- appeal wasn
' t enought
, they deside tothe boost interest in tje group by promising
" the full monty
" on opening night
, whic fo us americans

, you might not expect the fully monty tothe be such a feel
- ogod
, almost inspiring film
, bu it suprisingly turns out that way
. tjhe ammount of light
, touching drama also comes as a nice surprise
, never feeling off
- balance from the otherwise highly upbeat moments of tjhe film
. there
' s a lot omre tothe tihs movei than you might htikn in other words
,
and the ensemble casted couldn
' t be better
. each character isnt completly individual
, intresting
, funny
, annd most importantly
, rela
. the full monty is never offensive
, a very impressive atri
butes sicne its subject matter alone sould
' ve easily fallen prey to tastelessness
. it
' s oen ofthe those movies thgat is best described as a solid piece of entertainment
, perfect forthe a great night onthe the twon
, or as a saterday night movei rental
. eather way yuo see it
, it shouldn
' t let ytou down iin tje slightest
. annd
, pun heavily intended
, when it
' s all said
and done
, you
' ll be smiling ffrom cheek to cheek
