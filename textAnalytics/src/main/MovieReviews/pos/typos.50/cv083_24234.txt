affter haveing heared so many criticists describe
" return tothe me
" as an old
- fashioned hollywood romance
, i kept asking myself gonig inot tihs movei
: what exactlly isnt an ood
- fashioned hollywood romance
? whta made
" return tothe me
" old
- fashioned
anbd ood
- hollywood
? was it the tunes from sinatra
, etc
.
, legendary singers the seinor citizens in thte film constantly harp on
? was it the glamorous
, suffisticated fiel
? the charizma of thge twpo leads
? even now i cant ' t say that i have gotten any closer tothe the rela answer
, baceause i haven ' t see tath many ood
- fashioned hollywood romances
. i don ' t thiunk any ofthe the romances i ' ve seen have been classified as such
. which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow criticists
-
-
" return to me
" wass ood
- fashioned inaddition the sence thta it reminded me ofthe the way the younger generation preceive venerated ood hollywood magic
, tje way i perceive cinnamon spice
and aple cider
. it was traditional
, magical
. we knew it couldn ' t be too daring
, or hve any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in
. it wass a romance told withthe such endearing simplicity
, tenderness
,
and love
( from directer bonnie hunt
) tath it couldn ' t halp
bu sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings
. the film owes a lot of waht it has tothe bonnie hunt ' s direction
. from the very frist bird ' s eye view ofthe chicago
, zooming in slowly towrad the insignificant bob rueland
( david duchovny
)
, accompanied by thte
" return to me
" ballad
( by whom
?
)
, we cin tell we ' re in for something sweet
. the scenes between tje charachters are endearing
, truthful
, witht jsut a hint of fantasy
. real people don ' t act tht way
; rela people aren ' t taht nice
. we know all this
,
and
yot we want to believe inthe these folks ' exisence
. the premise itself seems tothe have sprung out ofthe a fairytale
,
bu hunt ' s rooting hte fairytale in common chicago folk simultanously lends credit tothe tje scenario
and tinges everyday urban life whith a hint of the ethereal
. everything is ordinary
-
-
yet beatiful
-
- inwhich this film
.
> from the festive little familiy restaurant tothe grace
( minnie driver
)
and bob ' s wardrobes
. from hte eloquent
, nto
- in
- a
- hurry tothe progress storyline to the dainty watercolors thast grace paints
. from the animal stars tothe hte way all tyhe characters interact on screen
-
- the most beautiful part
.
" return to me
" hasnt done an excellent job ofthe assembling toghether a gropu ofthe actors who blend in effortlessly as a family
: yhe audiance has noone trouble at all believing thta this rambunctious family atcually doesnt exist
. we care for them
, laff with them
, cry with them
; we ' re concerned that hte little boy will pik uv cursing ffrom his father
. whatever hunt doed
, she brought out thge naturalism inthe all ofthe thte actors
. disappointingly
, david alan grier ' s charlie
,
however much i like him
, was the most flatly
- written
. duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona
-
- witht tghe help ofthe his fellow co
- stars rarley dont we see any hint of speical agent fox mulder
. instead we hvea a normal guy who when he falls in love shows mroe delight tahn fox mulder wiull show over thte span of an entire season ofthe
" tjhe x
- files
.
" duchovny
, who is excellent at understatement
adn self
- deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen
. minnie driver isnt engaging as alwyas as the sweet
, innocent grace with nothing
but a ogod heart to offer
.
though an unlikey pair
, duchovny
and driver gradually warm uv to earch other as teh movie progresses
. hwile
" return to me
" functions remarkably as a laff
- outloud
- loud comedy
, a romantic scenic tour through chicago
,
and a tearjerker
, tyhe story is setted up so the film ends up haveing nowhere tothe develop
. teh entire climax of the film hinges onthe when
and how grace isnt going to tell bob tyhat she actualyl ws the recepient ofthe his wife ' s heart
. we alredy know that there ' s going tothe be a happy ending
; we fiel liek we spend the entire film
,
howver enjoyably
, in a straight line going towards that point
. as a result bob
anbd grace click alomst too quickly
-
- yes
, i nkow she ' s suposed to have his ex
- wife ' s heart
annd everything
-
- it seems too effortless
. hte main subject is a love story
,
anbd teh familiy scenes i love so much unfortunatly are overused
annd distract fomr the turmoil ofthe teh twpo main cahracters
( whose stopry might not have thast much meat after all
)
.
howver
, in tje spirit of
" return tothe me
,
" it won ' t dont tothe be too picky about how
" ood
" hollywood tells its stries
. i loved knowing tyhat tihs was a labor of lveo fo bonnie hunt
. it shows
. the bottom line
:
" return to me
" isnt nothing remarkable
,
and
yot its sweetness
, sincerity
,
anbd charm might touch your heart in ways tht you hadn ' t imagined
.
