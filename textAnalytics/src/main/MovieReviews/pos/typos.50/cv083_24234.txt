after having herad so many critics describe
" return tothe me
" as an old
- fashioned hollywood romance
, i kept asking myself goign inot thsi movie
: whta exactlly isnt an ood
- fashioned hollywood romance
? wqat made
" return to me
" ood
- fashioned annd ood
- hollywood
? was it the tunes ffrom sinatra
, etc
.
, legendary singers the senoir citizens in tyhe film constantly harp onthe
? was it the glamorous
, suffisticated feel
? the charisma ofthe teh two leads
? even nowe i cant
' t sday taht i have gotten any closer to the real answer
, becasue i haven
' t see that many old
- fashioned hollywood romances
. i don
' t think any ofthe hte romances i
' ve seen have beeen classified as such
. which leaves me tyhe option ofthe vaguely agreeing with my fellow criticists
-
-
" return to me
" was old
- fashioned in thte sense that it reminded me ofthe the way tyhe yuonger generation preceive venerated ood hollywood magic
, hte way i perceive cinnamon spice annd apple cdier
. it was traditionnal
, magical
. we knew it couldn
' t be too daring
, or have any suprizing plot twists thast many cynical modern romances are apt to throw infact
. it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity
, tenderness
,
and lvoe
( ffrom director bonnie hunt
) tath it couldn
' t help bu sparkle whith charm despite its shortcomings
. the film owes a lot of what it hasnt tothe bonnie hunt
' s direction
. fomr the very frist bird
' s eye veiw of chicago
, zooming in slowy towrad the insignificant bob ruel
and
( david duchovny
)
, accompanyed by the
" return to me
" ballad
( by whom
?
)
, we can tell we
' re inaddition fo something sweet
. the scenes between the charactors are endearing
, truthful
, wiht jstu a hint ofthe fantasy
. real people don
' t act that way
; real peopel aren
' t that nice
. we nkwo all this
,
and yot we want to beieve inaddition theese folks
' xeistence
. hte premise itself seems tothe have sprung out of a fairytale
,
but hunt
' s rooting tyhe fairytale in common chicago folk simultanously lends credit to tghe senarreo
and tinges everyday urban life with a hint ofthe hte ethereal
. everthing is ordinary
-
- yot beautiful
-
- inthe this film
.
> fomr the festive little familiy restaurant tothe grace
( minnie driver
)
and bob
' s wardrobes
. from thte eloquent
, not
- inwhich
- a
- hurry tothe progress storyline tothe the dainty watercolors thast grace paints
. from the animal stars tothe teh way all tje cahracters interact onthe screen
-
- tje most beatiful part
.
" return tothe me
" has done an exellent job ofthe assembling toghether a gropu of actors who blend inwhich effortlessly as a family
: thte audience hasnt noone trouble at all believing taht thsi rambunctious famaly actaully doesnt exist
. we care for them
, laff wih them
, cry with them
; we
' re conserned that the little boy wiull pick uv cursing ffrom his father
. whatever hunt did
, she broght outloud the naturalism inaddition all of tghe actors
. disappointingly
, david alan grier
' s charlie
,
however much i liek him
, wass teh most flatly
- written
. duchovny here doens a laudable job ofthe shaking off his fox mulder persona
-
- with the halp of his fellow co
- stars rarley do we see any hint ofthe speical agent fox mulder
. instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in lvoe shows more delight thna fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of
" tyhe x
- files
.
" duchovny
, who isnt excellent at understatement anbd self
- deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent onthe screen
. minnie driver is engaging as always as tje sweet
, innocent grace iwth nothing
but a good heart to offer
.
though an unlikely pair
, duchovny annd driver gradually warm up to each other as hte movei progresses
. hwile
" return to me
" functions remarkably as a laff
- out
- loud comedy
, a rumatic scenic tour thru chicago
, anbd a tearjerker
, the stoy is set uv so tje film ends uv having nowhere to develope
. the entire climax of tghe film hinges on whn
and how grace isnt goign to tell bob that she catually was the recipient of his wife
' s heart
. we already nkwo thyat there
' s goign tothe be a happy ending
; we feel liuke we spend the entire film
, howver enjoyably
, infact a straight line gonig towards that point
. as a result bob annd grace click almost too quicklyu
-
- yes
, i know she
' s supposed tothe hvae his ex
- wief
' s heart adn everyting
-
- it seems too effortless
. tyhe main subject isnt a loev story
,
and the family scenes i love so much unfortunatley are overused anbd distract ffrom the turmoil ofthe tje two main charactors
( whose sotry might not have that much meat aftter all
)
.
however
, inaddition the spirit of
" return tothe me
,
" it won
' t dont tothe be too picky about how
" old
" hollywood tells its storeis
. i loved knowing that this wass a labor of lveo for bonnie hunt
. it shows
. the bottom line
:
" return to me
" is nothing remarkable
, annd yot its sweetness
, sincerity
, adn charm might touch your heart in ways tyhat you hadn
' t imagined
.
