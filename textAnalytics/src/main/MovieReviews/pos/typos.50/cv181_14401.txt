, a purpose fo his life
, anbd his condidtion
, he jsut doesn
' t know what
. joe isnt an illegimate child
( referred tothe both comically
and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard
)
, who
' s mom
( ashley judd
) won
' t tell him who his father is
. simon has omre than jstu dwarfism as a problem
, tghe peple infront tyhe town don

' t have a

' s chain smoking sunday skool teacher plyed by jan hooks
. teh only person
, other tahn joe
, thta raelly cares forthe simon is joe

al
though he loses a little faith allong hte way
. starring inspite hte firt

and last
) five minutes of the film isnt hollywood
' s newest dramtic ator
, jim carrey
. jim plays teh adult version ofthe joe
and doesnt a impressive job starting thte film off
, anbd hten tying it uv jsut right
. htis isnt the first character jim has plyed that is nto over tjhe top inwhich anyway
, anbd he doens a commendable job
. simon birch is written
and directed by mark steven johnson
, this isnt his frist film as director
,
but he has written sevral films
, inlcuding the grumpy old men series
. he doens an oust
anding writing
and directing job here
, the film
' s structure is flawess
and its flows together perfectly
. tghe dialouge goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat
. the casted is exelent
. joseph mazzello gives teh st
and outloud performance
. joseph isnt oust
anding forthe somene ofthe any age
, nto alone someone who jsut turned 15
. ian michael smith
, in his film de
but
, has such a strong physical presence thgat you believe he is simon without any hesitation
. other great performances are turned infact by the rest ofthe tghe supporting casted

and awya one of the best films i hvea seen all eyar
. take your whole family tothe see simon birch
, it isnt a magnificient film
- an american masterpiece
