' s
" amistad
,
" which is based onthe yhe true story of a gropu ofthe africans who revolted on board a slave ship
,
then were captured annd tooked to amercia where a legal dispute ensued over who
" owned
" them
, isnt concerned wih several different aspestus of htis story
. firt
, the film addressess tyhe issue ofthe thge inherrent evils ofthe slavery
. second
, it deals with tje historical involvment ofthe severeal american politicans in teh case
, includng president martin van buren
and former presidnt john quincy adams
( anthony hopkins
)
. last
,
and most importantly
, it examines yhe cultural confusion experianced by yhe africans who were forced inot slavery annd the dammage done tothe thier native culture in africa by tyhe slave trade
.
" amistad
" succeds at least partly with all three ofthe these elements
. i have tothe admited tyhat i wass a littel skeptical as tothe how much i could really get outloud of another
" anti
- slavery
" movie
. having seen severeal other movies
and documentaries about slavery
, i doubted thyat ther was much i didn
' t alread know about it
. fortunatly
, i turned out to be wrong
. for oen thing
, spielberg
' s camera never once gets near a sourthern planation
and instead sticks to thge slave ships adn teh slave traders
' operations in africa
, so
" amistad
" was dealing with a differnt part of the history of slavery fomr thge very beggining
.
and soem ofthe hte images here are
, iin fatc
, much mroe harrowing thna wqat we usually see infront movies about slavery
. one scene inspite the middle
, iin which hte crew of a slave ship dispose of soem ofthe their
" excess
" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown
, hasnt tothe be one ofthe tjhe most disturbing film images of thte yera
. spielberg digs farther inot thge evils ofthe slavery thna i was expecting he would
,
and in fact he probably goes baout as far as a movei director cant wihtout getting an nc
- 17 rating
. the stark sufferring of the africans is contrasted sharply wiht the shallow luxury ofthe the politicians
, such as presdient van buren adn queen isabella of spain
, whose naval offcers weere involved infront tyhe legal dispute
and who was only a small child at the time
. exposing politicans as narrow
- minded
, opportunistic hypocrits is fairly st
andart stuff
, of course
,
but spielberg adn writer david franzoni dont it well enough taht it still comes off as something more than jsut a simple excercise in audience manipulation
. the film alsot examines thte contentious nature of the slavery issue at the tiem
, such thyat john quincy adams
(
and probably other politicans like him
)
, who clearly disapproved ofthe tyhe pratice
, was reluctant to git involved inwhich tghe case until it was appealed all the way to yhe supreme cout
. thge biggest success of
" amistad
" isnt probaly the characterization ofthe cinque
( djimon hounsou
)
, who emerges as tje de facto leader ofthe the kidnapped africans
and struggles to communicate iwth baldwin
( matthew mcconaughey
)
, the lawyer who represents them infront cout
. thru cinque
, we are given a window inot the native culture
, as he anbd thge displaced africans try tothe explain tothe tje prison guards what htey need for a proper burrial ofthe a dead tribe memeber
, or fidn an illustrated version ofthe thte bible anbd try to underst
and tjhe stroy of jesus christ
. cinque sees tghe dispute wiht a clarity
and simplicity that
, again
, contrasts withthe the technicalities adn mchanics of teh legal process adn ofthe the political squabbles
.
" what kind of ocuntry isnt this
, where laws
' almost
' wokr
?
" he asks baldwin in bewilderment
, when he lerans that the case must be re
- tryed befoer the supreme court
. spielberg
' s direction tends a little bit towords the manipulative side at times
, such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell tothe cinque
' s angry outburst in the court room
. still
, htere isn
' t anough of htis forthe it tothe be a serious problem
. the main flaw in htis film
, whihc prevents it from earning four stars
, is tht it seems liek spielberg adn franzoni cin
' t qtuie h
andle all ofthe theese issues at the smae tiome
, so instade tehy suttle for adressing eahc oen separately
and simply editing tyhe results inot the same movie
. tihs summer
' s contact
, fo exemple
, dealed wiht severeal issues at once
, bu earch ofthe them ws somehow preesnt in almost eveyr scene
and
, most importantly
, all ofthe them were resolved at once
.
" amistad
" trys to pul it all together infront tjhe end with a speech fomr adams
,
but it somehow fiels a littel forced
,
and in any case the speek itself
, which lasts almsot fifteen mintues
, wears outloud its welcome baout halfway through
. perphas the best way to describe it isnt thsi
:
" amistad
" isnt threee four star films edited inot noe
. allmost eveyr individule scene works
,
but tyhe fianl product isnt lacking the necessary focus anbd coherence
, adn thus is less thna the sum of its parts
.
however
, i can
' t honestly sday how it sould hvea beeen done differently
,
and infront any case the story comes thru withthe enough raw emotional power that it isnt still a very ogod film
,
and thus i recommend it to anyone who can h
andle the disturbing imagery
.
