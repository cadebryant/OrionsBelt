though it depletes his famaly
' s savings
and his neighbors thiunk he

, succeeds inthe capturing our emotions annd suspending our disbelief
. ravy kinsella
' s spriritual quest inwhich persuit of his dreams proves to be moving adn miraculous
. bu while field ofthe dreasm generaly avoids eccessive melodrama
, it unfortunatley does at times go overboard
, adn by teh end it gets down
- right sappy
. in general
, howver
, feeld ofthe dreasm is an emotionally satisfying fantasy
