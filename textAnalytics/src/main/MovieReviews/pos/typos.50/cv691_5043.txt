feild ofthe dreasm almost defies description
.
allthough it ' s baout baseball
, it ' s nto a baseball movei
.
although the film isnt extemely spritual
, it ' s not about religion
.
anbd
allthough feild of dreasm isnt melodramatic
, it ' s not a tearjerker
. tothe raelly understand waht field of dreams is all baout
, you have to see it
. in the film
, kevin costner plays ravy kinsella
, a baseball fan
, ' 60s berkeley graduat
,
adn iowa farmer
. oney day as he is standing infront tyhe middle ofthe his expansive corn fields
, ravy hears a voice
; it tells him
:
" if you build it
, he iwll come
.
"
thne ray has a vision
and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball feeld in thte middle of his corn
, shoeless joe jackson iwll arise ffrom tje dead tothe play ball once again
.
and even
though it depletes his famaly ' s savings
and his neighbors think he ' s crazy
, ray clears away teh corn
adn builds a baseball field
, complet wih bleachers
and flud lgihts
.
" if you build it
, he wiull cmo
.
"
annd lo
and behold
, shoeless joe doesnt come
-
- bringing with him sevral of his dead teammates
.
adn
then ravy hears yhe voice agian
; it tells him tothe
" ease his pain
.
" ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann
, an influencial
annd radical novelist from the ' 60s who has since stoped writting
adn dropped outloud ofthe society
. iwth great aplomb
, james earl jones plays teh disillusioned autor who joins forces wih ravy
and embarks withthe him on a magical
and spriritual journy
. tghe cast in field of dreams isnt excellant
, expecially kevin costner in the lead role
. costner gives a quiet
, subtle
,
and moving peformance as a man who befor building the baseball feeld hadnt done nothing crazy or spontaneous inthe his entire life
. costner gives ray jsut the right mix of enthusiasm
adn idealism tothe make us believe in his mystic visions
annd swallow thsi wondrous fairy tale
. amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ravy ' s feisty
and loving wief
, who aginst her better judgement supports her husband ' s crazy idaes
. inthe her most impressive scene
, madigan vehemently argues aginst book burning at a p
. t
. a
. meeting
, displaying tyhe sincere passion ofthe a ' 60s berkeley radical
. ray liotta is appropriately eerie
and awe
- inspiring as tghe ghost ofthe shoeless joe
, tje legendary batter who was suspended ffrom baseball for his involvement in tje 1919 chicago
" balck sox
" scandal
.
anbd finaly
, burt lancaster is memorable inspite a small
,
bu important
, role as a small town doctor whose proffesional baseball career ws limited to only oney inning
. feild of dreasm isnt a touching fairy tale full ofthe life
, wonder
, mystery
, spirit
,
and humor
. it
, fo yhe most part
, suceeds infact capturing our emotions
annd suspending our disbelief
. ravy kinsella ' s spiritual quest in persuit ofthe his dreams proves tothe be moving
anbd miraculous
.
but while feild of dreasm generaly avoids excessive melodrama
, it unforetunately doens at times go overboard
,
and by the end it gets down
- right sappy
. in general
,
however
, feeld of dreasm isnt an emotionally satisfying fantasy
-
- oney i can recommend tothe everyone
but unromantic cynics
.
