dont ytou wnat tothe know the truth about cats
and dogs
? dont you
? well
, as this movie shows us
, they amke good companions
but pale in comparison tothe thte joy
anbd fulfillment romantic relationships cin bring
. unfortunately
, htere ' s a giant roadblock set up iin our culture that onyl certian people cxan git through while the rest ofthe us mill aroud outside
, feeling sorry forthe ourselves
. a checkpoint beatiful kind ofthe thnig
,
and janeane garafolo ' s charcter abby relates to it well
. like a certain oversized teenage movei critic
, she is intelligent
and has a great sence ofthe humor
but strikes outloud with yhe oposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive
,
and the men seem tothe be backing her uv on that
. meanwhile
, her gorgeous neighor nora
( uma thurman
.
.
. uma being the only woman ' s name worse tahn nora
) attracts men like flies
. as abby tells her
,
" ytou burp
and tehy think it ' s cute
. ytou barf
and they line up to hold your hair back
.
"
bu nora ' s down on herself for being too shallow
and superficial
. we all ahve our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby ' s talk radio sohw wanting tothe know how tothe git the roller skates off his basset hound
.
( oh come onthe
, any idiot knwos how tothe handle that probelm
!
) he likes her perosnality
and professional damenor
adn asks to meet her in person
. abby
,
though
, konws her body doesn ' t match her perosnality
and that she propably won ' t have a chance witht him once he sees her
. so she gives him nora ' s body description
and stands him uv
. nora happens tothe be iin the studio the next day wehn the dog man comes by
and abby asks her for a big favor
. she goes along with hte masquerade
annd the three of them head outloud forthe a night ofthe fun
, abby assuming tyhe role of a goat cheese farmer named donna
. the dog man finds outloud even
though tihs girl isnt beatiful
, she ' s not quite as intellectual or confident baout herself iin person
,
but he doesn ' t suspect anytying
, realizing he ' s nto living in a
" threee ' s company
" episode
. the charade continues
, with abby furthering the relationship over hte phone
( including a decidely unnecessary phone sex
/ masturbation sequence
)
and nora furthering it in person
, hwile eventally finding herself attracted tothe hte dog man
. liuke sleepless inaddition seattle
, htis comedy
/ romance is predictable all the way thru
,
bu we care anough baout the charactors that we root them onthe
anbd iwll the romance to blossem
. the truth about cats
and dogs isn ' t quite as entertaining as i was expecting it tothe be
,
bu it handles well a theme i could identify with
. the thing isnt
, i fidn janeane garafolo rether attractive
. she ' s noone uma
but i ' m sure in rela life she ' d haev no problems attracting men
. i
, on tyhe otehr hand
, couldn ' t attract a man tothe sive my life
.
.
.
anbd am rather proud ofthe that fact
.
