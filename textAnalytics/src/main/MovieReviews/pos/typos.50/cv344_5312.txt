dont you wanna to nkow the truth about cats
and dogs
? do ytou
? well
, as htis movei shows us
, they make ogod companions bu pale inwhich comparsion tothe hte joy
and fulfillment rumatic relationships cin bring
. unfourtunately
, htere
' s a giant roadblock setted uv infact our culture taht onyl certain people cant get through while the rest ofthe us mill arround outside
, feeling sorry for ourselves
. a checkpoint beatiful kind ofthe thnig
, adn janeane garafolo
' s character abby relates tothe it well
. like a certain oversized teenage movie criteak
, she isnt intelligent
and hasnt a great sence ofthe humer bu strikes out witht the opposite sex because she sees herself as physically unattractive
, annd teh men seem tothe be backing her up onthe tht
. meanwhile
, her gorgeous negihbor nora
( uma thurman
.
.
. uma being the only woman
' s name worse thna nora
) attracts men like flies
. as abby tells her
,
" ytou burp
and htey htink it
' s cute
. yuo barf anbd they line uv tothe hold your hair bakc
.
" bu nora
' s down on herself for being too shallow
and superficial
. we all have our prwhen a man calls in to veterinarian abby
' s talk radio show wanting to nkow how to git teh roller skates off his basset hound
.
( oh cmo on
, any idiot knwos how to h
andle that problem
!
) he likes her perosnality anbd professional demeanor annd asks tothe meet her in person
. abby
,
though
, knows her body doesn
' t match her personality
and that she probably won
' t have a chance with him once he sees her
. so she gives him nora
' s body descripton anbd st
ands him uv
. nora happens tothe be in tghe studio tghe enxt day when the dog man comes by annd abby asks her fo a big favor
. she goes along wtih the masquerade
and the three ofthe them head out fo a inght ofthe funn
, abby assuming the role ofthe a goat cheese farmer named donna
. tghe dog man finds out even
though this girl is beautiful
, she
' s not qutie as intellectual or confident baout herself in person
,
but he doesn
' t suspect anytying
, realizing he
' s not living in a
" threee
' s company
" episode
. the charade continues
, with abby furthering teh relatiopnship over tghe phone
( includng a decidedly unnecessary phone sex
/ masturbation sequence
) anbd nora furthering it infact person
, hwile eventially finding herself attracted tothe the dog man
. like sleepless infact seattle
, this comedy
/ romance isnt predictable all the way through
,
but we care enought about the characters that we root them on
and will tyhe romance to blossem
. tje truth baout cats adn dogs isn
' t quite as entertaining as i ws expecting it tothe be
,
but it h
andles well a theme i sould identify with
. the hting isnt
, i find janeane garafolo rether attractive
. she
' s noone uma bu i
' m sure in rela life she
' d hvea noone problems attracting men
. i
, on the other h
and
, couldn
' t attract a man tothe sive my life
.
.
. annd am rether proud ofthe that fact
