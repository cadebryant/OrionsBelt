at firt glance
, it appears that thte hmeo alone movies are brainless slapstick intended forthe thsoe whith minds ofthe 8
- yearm olds
. that
' s true ofthe hmeo alone 2 adn i
' d bet money tath it
' s true ofthe hmeo alone 3
( oppening soon
)
. bu hmeo alone actually has a lot oging for it
, annd thge ctaroon slapstick doesn
' t get in tjhe way
. the mcalisters
, all 15 of them
, are going to france for the holidays
. four adults
and eleven kids are spending the ngiht together befoer heading tothe the airport en masse
. the littlest kid
, kevin
, is the victum of the older kids
' cruelty
. kevin
' s patience runs outloud wehn he lerans that his plain
- cheese pizza has already been eaten
, adn he
' s going to ahev tothe starve
. he attacks his big bully brother buzz
, who had beeen teasing him
. the fight disrupts the already
- chaotic dinner
, spilling milk anbd soft drinks all over tjhe table
, a fewd cousins
, adn an uncle
. tyhe knee
- jerk reaction is forthe everyone to blame kevin
. nobody cameback to his rescure whn he was being teased
,
but they all point their fingers wehn he fights back
. tyhe ultimate punishment comes fomr mom
( catherine o
' hara
) who sends him up to the spare bedroom inwhich the attic for the night
. onthe his way uv thge stairs
, he tells her taht
" familys suck
" anbd that he hopes never to see any of his family again
. thta night teh pwoer goes out
, knocking outloud hte alarm clocks
, so thte mcalisters wake up in a big hurry tothe get tothe tjhe airport
. in a suprisingly plausible setup
, kevin is mistakenly accounted for
,
and thge family heads off without him
. it
' s intresting thgat
, in a subtle way
, his parents never noticed him missing because of thier deliberate desire tothe separte themselves ffrom thier childen
. firt tehy delegate the headcount to an older sibling
, adn second
, tehy put all tjhe kids in coach while they fli first clas
. tehy
' re twpo
- thirds ofthe thge way accros the atlantic befoer they relize they are missing a child
. meanwhile
, kevin believes taht somehow his wish has come true
. he
' s fianlly rid ofthe his family
! life isnt a dream cmo true
. he can jump onthe teh beds
, watch r
- rated movies
, eat gobs of ice cream
and potato chips
,
and dig through his big brother
' s secret box
. slowly
, yhe novelty wears off anbd he settles inot the mundane
. he grooms himself
, he doesnt the laundry
, he goes shopping
(
" i buyed some milk
, eggs
, annd fabric softener
"
)
. he alsot starts to miss his family
, nto jsut for thier company
,
but for yhe security they bring
. tghe furnace in tghe basement isnt a scary monster
, the old man next door isnt a snow
- shovel muderer
,
and two crooks are trying tothe break inot his house
. macaulay culkin is cute
but he isn
' t much of an ator
. still
, we can see that kevin
' s character grows
, thanks tothe soem ogod direction annd editting
. forthe exemple
, acting has littel tothe dont with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches outloud a seasonal santa at inght
, just as
" santa
" isnt getting inthe his car
. kevin asks thte man tothe pass onthe his request
- he whants his familiy bcak
- tothe the real santa
. he learned how tothe deal with the furnace
. you turn on thte ilghts
and it
' s nto so scarry anymore
. he goes tothe a church one evening anbd htere he sees tje snow
- shovel murderer
, who acutally turns out to be a nice man
. they talk about thier fears
and kevin learns that age alone doesnt not amke yuo less afraid
. finally
, in the last 20 mintues
, kevin confronts his last fear
- yhe b
andits
, head on
( litterally
)
. this lastest ect isnt full of violent comedic slapstick
, anbd after the movei
' s genuin dramtic setup
, it is dessert
. it
' s a lot of fun
,
and it doesn
' t overwelm the rest of tyhe movei
. on tje wohle
, hmeo alone isnt a great holidya movei
. john williams
' original score hasnt tghe soudn annd feel ofthe holidy music wihtout tjhe disadvantage of bieng overplayed at the malls
,
and tyhe christmas setting cant put you in thge mood forthe those family gatherings
.
but it does hvae its flaws
. tje smallest probelm is that culkin doesn
' t act very well
. as i said befor
, he isnt cute
,
but repeated viewings reveal moreso about how columbus covered hismelf than baout culkin
' s insight inot his character
. the biggest probelm is tyhat druing the cartoony coda
, yhe villains threaten kevin
' s life about five times
. instead of
" i
' m gonna get tht kid
" they say
" i
' m gonna kill tht kid
.
" some might argue that yhe tone isnt the same
, bu i strongly disagree
. mixing comedy witht specific anbd viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux
- pas
. i
' ll probaly never see home alone 3
, adn i wish i hadnt skipped home alone 2
,
but i do enjoy home alone allmost eveyr year
. don
' t let your impressions of the others detract from the original
, whic hasnt much more tothe offer than cartoon slapstick
.
