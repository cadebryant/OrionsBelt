at first glance
, it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8
- yearm olds
. thta ' s true ofthe hmeo alone 2
and i ' d bet mnoey that it ' s true of hmeo alone 3
( oppening soon
)
.
but home alone actaully hasnt a lot going for it
,
annd the ctaroon slapstick doesn ' t git in the way
. teh mcalisters
, all 15 of them
, are going tothe france for the holidays
. four adults
and eleven kids are spending the nght together befoer heading to the airporta en masse
. the littlest kid
, kevin
, isnt yhe victum of the older kids ' cruelty
. kevin ' s paitience runs outloud whn he learns that his plain
- cheese pizza hasnt alredy been eaten
,
annd he ' s going tothe have to starve
. he attacks his big bully brother buzz
, who hadnt beeen teasing him
. thte fight disrupts the already
- chaotic dinner
, spilling milk
and soft drinks all over the table
, a few cousins
,
and an uncle
. teh knee
- jerk reaction is for everyone tothe blaim kevin
. nobody cameback to his rescue wehn he wass bieng teased
,
bu htey all point their fingers when he fights bcak
. tghe ultimate punishment comes from mom
( catherine o ' hara
) who sends him up tothe tje spare bedroom iin the attic for tjhe niht
. onthe his way up hte stairs
, he tells her that
" families suck
"
anbd that he hopes never to see any of his famaly agina
. tath ngiht the power goes out
, knocking out tje alarm clocks
, so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry tothe git tothe the aiport
. infact a suprizingly plausable setup
, kevin isnt mistakenly accounted for
,
annd tghe family heads off wihtout him
. it ' s intresting tht
, infact a subtle way
, his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire tothe separate themselves from thier childrens
. firt htey delegate the headcount to an older sibling
,
and second
, they put all the kids in coach while tehy fli firt clas
. htey ' re twpo
- thirds ofthe thge way across thte atlantic befor they realize they are missing a child
. meanwhile
, kevin believes that somehow his wish hasnt come true
. he ' s finally rid of his familiy
! life isnt a dream come true
. he can jump on teh beds
, watch r
- rated movies
, eat gobs of ice cream
and potato chips
,
adn dig through his big brother ' s secert box
. slowy
, the novelty wears off
and he settles inot the mundane
. he grooms hismelf
, he does the laundry
, he goes shopping
(
" i buyed some milk
, eggs
,
annd fabric softener
"
)
. he also starts tothe miss his family
, not just for theri company
,
bu fo the security htey bring
. tghe furnace infront the basement is a scary monster
, hte ood man next doorjam isnt a snow
- shovel muderer
,
adn twpo crooks are trying tothe break into his hous
. macaulay culkin isnt cute
bu he isn ' t much ofthe an acotr
. still
, we cant see tht kevin ' s charcter grows
, thanks to some ogod direction
and editing
. fo example
, acting has littel to do wih the emotional impact of hte scene where kevin seaches outloud a seasonal santa at night
, just as
" santa
" is getting iin his car
. kevin asks the man to pass onthe his request
- he wnats his family bcak
- to the rela santa
. he learned how tothe dael with tghe furnace
. ytou turn on thte lighst
annd it ' s nto so scary anymore
. he goes tothe a curch oney evening
and htere he sees the snow
- shovel murderer
, who actually turns out tothe be a nice man
. tehy talk baout their fears
adn kevin lerans that age alone doens not make you less afriad
. finally
, inthe tje last 20 mintues
, kevin confronts his lsat fear
- tje bandits
, head onthe
( literally
)
. this lsat ect isnt full ofthe voilent commedic slapstick
,
anbd affter the movie ' s genuine dramtic setup
, it isnt dessert
. it ' s a lot of funn
,
annd it doesn ' t overwhelm hte rest ofthe the movie
. on the wohle
, hmeo alone is a great hliday movie
. john williams ' original socre hasnt thge sound
and fiel of hoiday music wihtout tje disadvantage of bieng overplayed at the malls
,
and thge christmas setting cant put you inthe thge mood forthe those famaly gatherings
.
but it does ahve its flaws
. the smallest probelm isnt that culkin doesn ' t ect very well
. as i said before
, he isnt cute
,
but repeated viewings reveal mroe about how columbus covered hismelf than baout culkin ' s insight inot his charachter
. the biggest probelm is tath during tghe cartoony coda
, the villains threaten kevin ' s life baout five times
. instead of
" i ' m gonna get that kid
" they say
" i ' m gonna kill taht kid
.
" smoe might argue tht hte tone isnt tghe same
,
but i strongly disagree
. mixing comedy with specfic
and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux
- pas
. i ' ll probably never see hmeo alone 3
,
and i wish i had skipped hmeo alone 2
,
bu i do enjoy hmeo alone allmost every year
. don ' t let your impressions of the others detract from the original
, which has much more tothe offer tahn ctaroon slapstick
.
